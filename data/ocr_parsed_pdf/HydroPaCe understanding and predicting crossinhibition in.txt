ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein—protein interfaces contain important information
about molecular recognition. The discovery of conserved patterns
is essential for understanding how substrates and inhibitors are
bound and for predicting molecular binding. When an inhibitor
binds to different enzymes (e.g. dissimilar sequences, structures or
mechanisms what we call cross-inhibition), identification of invariants
is a difficult task for which traditional methods may fail.

Results: To clarify how cross-inhibition happens, we model the
problem, propose and evaluate a methodology called HydroPaCe
to detect conserved patterns. Interfaces are modeled as graphs of
atomic apolar interactions and hydrophobic patches are computed
and summarized by centroids (HP-centroids), and their conservation
is detected. Despite sequence and structure dissimilarity, our method
achieves an appropriate level of abstraction to obtain invariant
properties in cross-inhibition. We show examples in which HP-
centroids successfully predicted enzymes that could be inhibited by
the studied inhibitors according to BRENDA database.

1 INTRODUCTION

Enzyme inhibition occurs when a molecule binds to an enzyme, thus
decreasing its activity. Inhibitors may be proteic or non-proteic; they
can decrease the enzyme’s ability to bind substrates or can lower the
enzyme’s catalytic activity or a combination of both. Inhibition is an
important biochemical mechanism that is involved in metabolism
regulation. It controls many intra- and extracellular pathways,
inﬂammatory and immunological processes, virus replication and
many other biological functions (Barrett et (11., 2004) Furthermore,
once this natural phenomenon is understood, it might be used
for biotechnological purposes including the development of drugs,
insecticides, pesticides and disinfectants.

A particular case is the inhibition of peptidases; on this subject, the
MEROPS database is currently one of the most important peptidase

repositories (Rawlings et (11., 2008). The MEROPS database
groups both proteases and inhibitors hierarchically into families
(sequence-related entities) and Clans (structure-related entities).
A careful MEROPS search highlighted a well-known but intriguing
phenomenon: some protease inhibitors lack speciﬁcity and involve
different 3D structures and catalytic mechanisms. For instance,
Turkey Ovomucoid and Englin C act in different serine peptidase
Clans such as PA(S) (all (3 Trypsin-like folds) and SB (01/ f3 Subtilisin-
like folds) and soybean Kunitz trypsin inhibitor decays proteolytic
activity as much in serine peptidases as in metallopeptidases (which
have very different enzymatic mechanisms). We call this lack of
speciﬁcity cross-inhibition. Our main Challenge in this article is
to create a methodology that helps to understand and predict this
phenomenon.

Protease—inhibitor recognition and binding are determined by
a complex orchestration of interactions and entropic factors that
involve the entire protease—inhibitor—solvent system. Fortunately,
the experimental binding energetics of many protease—inhibitor
complexes have already been thermodynamically determined. It is
known, for example, that the binding of Turkey Ovomucoid with
Elastase at 25°C is Characterized by a negative Gibbs free energy
in which enthalpy Change is almost negligible but entropy Change
is largely positive (Baker and Murphy, 1997). Furthermore, we spot
a Clear trend of higher apolar/polar accessible surface area ratio
toward interface (Supplementary Fig. S1), which is an evidence of
the importance of the hydrophobic interactions in protease—inhibitor
complex formation. That said, we particularly focus our attention
on the search for conserved hydrophobic interaction patterns. We
deﬁne these patterns as invariant hydrophobic regions (or patches)
that are in contact with the same apolar complementary parts of the
inhibitor (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4). We show (Supplementary
Fig. S2) a strong linear relationship (Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient
of 0.98) between the inferred solvation entropy Change and the
extension of hydrophobic patches, measured in terms of the number
of hydrophobic atoms inside them.

Although there are many biochemical studies that analyze
diversity in inhibition processes [e.g. (Bode et (11., 1986; Chakrabarti
and Janin, 2002a; Laskowski and Qasim, 2000; Qasim et (11., 1997)],
experimental Characterization of inhibition is a labor-intensive
process. The large amount of possible inhibitors for a given enzyme
can make tests costly; hence, in silico methods can contribute to
predicting inhibitor—enzyme recognition.

Despite its evident importance, there are few models and
algorithms that identify recognition and interaction patterns that

could help to Clarify how cross-inhibition occurs. In this context,
a pattern is a conserved set of interface attributes that is used to
explain or predict binding.

Traditionally, sequence comparison and/or structural alignment
methods have been used in conservation detection (Melo-Minardi
et (11., 2007; Ribeiro et (11., 2010; Zhang et (11., 2011). According
to Tuncbag et (11. (2011), structures are more conserved than
sequences, and interface-forming residues (IRFs) are even more
conserved than the whole structure. However, these Classical
methods are inappropriate because in cross-inhibition we may deal
with very dissimilar sequences and even completely distant folds.

Indeed, in cross-inhibition pattern detection with traditional
methods, we identify essentially known conserved residues that
directly participate in the catalysis process, such as the catalytic
triad, the speciﬁcity pocket and oxyanion-binding sites. We note
that to correctly assess the eventual hydrophobic contribution
of the entire protease—inhibitor interface, we should abstract the
residue semantics and should assess patches at the atomic level.
A similar approach has been used to Characterize the core of
protein domains with similar folds but very divergent sequence
compositions (Soundararajan et (11., 2010). The atomic level is more
appropriate because all residues have apolar portions. Lysine, for
example, is considered a positively Charged residue (at neutral pH),
but there are also several hydrophobic methyl groups.

Enzyme—inhibitor recognition is determined by a network
of interactions between atoms; hence, graph modeling is a
straightforward approach. We model hydrophobic atoms as nodes
of a graph and the contacts between them as the edges. We use the
graph to obtain conserved hydrophobic patches or, in other words,
connected components.

Supposing that the most important property of a hydrophobic
patch is where it is positioned to interact with the ligand, we
abstract from its composition volume, shape and density, and
we represent the patch as a geometric centroid that we call the
HP-Centroid(hydrophobic patch centroid). In this work, we propose
a novel model and algorithms to detect conserved HP-Centroids in
cross-inhibition.

Finally, we present a qualitative case study that consists of
two examples of cross-inhibition, Trypsin-like and Subtilisin-like
enzymes, both of which belong to the serine proteases family.
They present completely different 3D structures and the sequence
identity is as low as 20% (Wallace et (11., 1996). However, they
possess exactly the same Ser-His-Asp triad on their active sites. In
the ﬁrst case, we have complexes of Trypsin-like and Subtilisin-
like enzymes inhibited by Eglin C (Betzel et (11., 1993), and in
the second case, we have complexes of the same families with
Turkey Ovomucoid (Papamokos et (11., 1982). We verify that the
HP-Centroids obtained from the complexes are present in a set of
sequence-diverse apo structures that are conserved throughout the
family.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

Each step of the proposed methodology, called HydroPaCe, is
described below. A complete workﬂow of the methodology is presented in
Figure 1.

2.1 Data selection and preparation

As explained previously, we have chosen serine proteases to test our
algorithm. We chose them because there are few other examples of

cross-inhibition structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al.,
2000). Moreover, this is a well-studied family that presents some peculiarities
and similarities in catalytic sites (Page and Di Cera, 2008). Although
Trypsin-like and Subtilisin-like have very different 3D structures, they
hydrolyze their substrates by the same mechanism (Ekici et al., 2008; Lesk
and Fordham, 1996; Siezen and Leunissen, 1997).

Enzyme—inhibitor complexes: we found ﬁve non-redundant complexes
involving the Eglin C inhibitor: four bond to Subtilisin-like (PDB IDs:
1TEC, 1CSE, 1MEE and lsBN) and one to Trypsin-like (PDB ID: 1ACB)
enzymes. Likewise, we found four complexes involving the Ovomucoid
inhibitor: three complexed with Trypsin-like (PDB IDs: 1CHO, 1PPF and
35GB) and one with Subtilisin-like (PDB ID: 1ROR) enzymes. Despite
the large amount of information on enzymatic complexes involving these
two families, there is much redundant information regarding the sequence
identities, and this leaves only a small number of non-redundant complexes
to be analyzed.

Apo enzymes: we selected a set of non-redundant apo enzymes from the
two families by removing enzymes that presented >50% of sequence identity.
Hence, we use 9 samples from Subtilisin-like and 35 from Trypsin-like
families. The complete list of PDB ids is presented in the Supplementary
Material.

All the structures were submitted to standardization processes using the
PDB Enhanced Structures Toolkit (PDBest) (Pires et al., 2007).

2.2 IFRs

The current analysis is restricted to regions of the molecular interface of
the enzyme and its inhibitor. The IFRs can be determined by three different
methods. The ﬁrst deﬁnes the interface simply by using a cut-off distance
between the residues of the interacting molecules (Chothia and J anin, 1975;
Conte et al., 1999). The second approach computes the interactions based
on differences in solvent-accessible surface area (ASA) when the monomers
are separated (Chakrabarti and Janin, 2002b; Janin et al., 1990). Finally,
the last approach deﬁnes interfaces through computational geometry using
Voronoi diagrams and the alpha shapes theory (Pontius et al., 1996). We used
the ASA method because it is the most used method and is therefore more
consolidated.

Enzyme—inhibitor IFRs: we computed the IFRs in the cross-inhibition
complexes using the ASA approach with the STING Millennium Suite
platform (SMS) (Neshich et al., 2003).

Projection of IFRs from complexes into apo enzymes: for the apo proteins,
the projection was derived by structural alignment using an enzymeiinhibitor
complex and the computed IFR. Moreover, the structures were solvated using
Gromacs. After applying the treatment to PDB ﬁles, all structures, including
the complex model, were superimposed using the program MultiProt. Finally,
the residues that aligned with the interface of the complex model were
considered the interfaces of the apo proteins. This process was performed
for analysis of both sets (Trypsin-like and Subtilisin-like) of single-chain
proteins in our database.

2.3 Problem modeling

The proposed method is based on the search for conserved hydrophobic
patches (HP-centroids). In what follows, we detail each step of our model:
Graph construction: the ﬁrst step of our model consists of the
representation of IFRs as graphs. The nodes are atoms from the IFR residues,
and the edges are the presumed contacts. According to our previous work
(da Silveira et al., 2009), there are two main approaches to identify contacts
in proteins: the ﬁrst is cut-off dependent (CD), and the other is independent
(CI). Although in the above-mentioned study we found that, at the residue
level, the CD approach was a simpler, more complete and more reliable
technique than some CI techniques, here we chose to use a CI methodology
because we did not ﬁnd a reliable cut-off value at the atomic level. This
paradigm uses classical computational geometry algorithms to compute a
Voronoi diagram (VD) (Poupon, 2004) and its dual problem, the Delaunay

Fig. 1. HydroPaCe workﬂow: We searched for 3D structures of subtilisin-like and trypsin-like families in the PDB database. The PDB ids were separated into
proteineinhibitor complexes and apo proteins. The structures with sequence identities that were >50% identical to other selected sequences were discarded. The
cross-inhibition complexes were aligned by the inhibitor’s chain (a), and the interfaces of contact (also called IFRs) were identiﬁed using ASA methodology
(b). The apo proteins were aligned by their single chains by using an enzymeeinhibitor complex to project the interface. Using DT, possible interatomic
contacts were computed, resulting in the edges of a graph where nodes are atoms (c). We considered only the hydrophobic interactions between atoms and
removed edges that represented covalent bonds. We then identiﬁed the connected components that represent the hydrophobic patches in these graphs ((1).
We propose two levels of abstractions to represent the hydrophobic patches, both of which are based on geometric centroids (HP-centroids). The ﬁrst is a
coarse-grained analysis that consists of computing a centroid for each connected component, and the second is a ﬁne-grained analysis that searches for dense
subregions using two different community detection algorithms and calculating the HP-centroids on communities. The obtained HP-centroids were clustered
using the OM and AC methods (e). Finally, the HP-centroids were evaluated using PRM, which accounts positively for coverage in terms of enzymes and
negatively for enzyme redundancy. In (aid), the left-hand structure is Subtilisin-like and the right-hand structure is Trypsin-like.

Deletion of polar edges: once we have a geometrical inference of
non-occluded interactions, we classify them into hydrophobic and polar
interactions based on the classiﬁcation rules proposed in Sobolev et al.
(1999). The complete table with the classiﬁcations of all the atoms can be
found in the Supplementary Material. As discussed previously, we restrict our
analysis to hydrophobic interactions type by removing polar contact edges.
Nevertheless, the analysis can be extended to deal with polar areas.

Computation of hydrophobic patches: we use a depth-ﬁrst search
to efﬁciently detect the connected components, which are natural
representations of the hydrophobic patches.

Abstraction of hydrophobic patches through centroids: hydrophobic
patches may occur in different shapes and volumes; our model considers two
levels of abstractions to represent them, both of which are based on geometric
centroids (HP-centroid). The ﬁrst, which we call the coarse-grained analysis,
consists of computing a centroid for each connected component. The second
is a ﬁne-grained analysis that divides the original connected components into
dense subgraphs or communities. A community is a subgraph in which the
nodes are much more connected with the other nodes in the community than
with the external nodes. In this approach, the HP-centroids are computed
based on communities.

In conclusion, our method is based on the computation of hydrophobic
patches and their abstraction through geometric centroids (HP-centroids)
that can represent the entire patch (coarse-grained) or communities of these
patches (ﬁne-grained). Considering the HP-centroids of a set of cross-
inhibition complexes, we propose algorithms to cluster the centroids and to
detect those that are conserved across all of them. We describe the algorithms
in the next section and then explain how to evaluate the clusters obtained.

2.4 Algorithms

Here, we describe in more detail the different approaches (coarse- and
ﬁne-grained) that we propose to abstract from the hydrophobic patches. We
brieﬂy describe the paradigms for community detection used in ﬁne-grained
decomposition of hydrophobic patches. Finally, we explain the algorithms
that we use to cluster the HP-centroids: one attempts to globally match
similar centroids and the other locally clustered centroids in an agglomerative
manner.

CCC: Connected Component Centroids is the name we give to the
coarse-grained approach.

EBCC: the Edge Betweenness Community Centroid (EBCC) (Newman
and Girvan, 2004) is a divisive approach in which the most central edges
are broken one after another until the modularity of the graph is maximized.
The edge centrality is computed through the edge betweenness, which counts
the number of shortest paths that traverse through that edge. The higher the
value of edge betweenness, the more the edge is used or the more central it
is. In other words, this value indicates when there are no redundant edges to
cross between different communities and when the edge joins two different
communities.

SGCC: the Spin Glass Community Centroid (SGCC) (Reichardt and
Bornholdt, 2006) tries to ﬁnd communities in graphs Via a spin-glass model
and simulated annealing. That is, it uses simulated annealing to maximize
graph modularity. The modularity of a possible division of a graph into
communities is deﬁned as the fraction of edges that falls within a given
community minus the expected value of this fraction if edges were randomly
distributed. Commonly, the randomization of the edges is done in such a way
as to preserve the degree of each vertex.

OM: we have developed a linear programming Optimization Model (OM)
that is based on the transport problem and that attempts to match points
by globally minimizing the differences between the edge sizes between
all possible pairs of points. The optimization functions that we want to
minimize, as well as the associated restrictions, are explained in detail in
the Supplementary Material.

AC: this method is a local strategy based on Agglomerative Clustering
(AC). It matches the closest HP-centroids through an iterative bottom-up
agglomerative process. In this case, there is an important decision about

when to stop the process to ensure that we have high-quality clusters. The
strategy for determining this stopping point, and a detailed explanation of
the algorithm, are presented in the Supplementary Material.

2.5 Evaluation

To perform a quantitative evaluation of the clusters formed by the matches,
we propose a metric based on the concept of recall that is penalized
when different HP-centroids of the same protein (redundant centroids) are
grouped together. We have it called the penalized recall metric (PRM) and
is formalized below:

PRM =

 

 

(1)

where (C(12)) is the number of pairs of centroids from different enzymes in
the same cluster,  is the number of pairs of HP-centroids from the same
protein in the same cluster, (CG) is the total number of pairs of HP-centroids
in the cluster and the values of D and E are limited to P.

The metric produces values in the range of [— 1; 1] where —1 is the worst
case, with minimum recall and maximum redundancy. It will result in 1 when
we have maximum recall and minimum redundancy. When we have similar
values for recall and redundancy, the metric approaches 0.

The average of the PRM of the clusters was used to evaluate the three
different approaches (CCC, EBCC and SGCC). It cannot be used to compare
between the OM and AC. In the OM, clusters are formed with total variability
by deﬁnition; in other words, there are no pair of centroids of the same
enzyme in a cluster.

In this case, we use traditional intra- and intercluster average distances.
A priori, a high-quality cluster must have low intracluster and high
intercluster distances. That is because, in an ideal clustering, similar elements
must be grouped together and dissimilar ones must be separated.

In conclusion, we compare the proposed approaches in the light of the
PRM (the closer to 1, the better) and the average intra- and intercluster
distances (it is better to have low intracluster and high intercluster distances).

3 RESULTS

In this section, we present and discuss the results of the case
study of serine peptidases (Trypsin-like and Subtilisin-like) that are
cross-inhibited by Eglin C and Turkey Ovomucoid. We also compare
the quality of the conserved HP-centroids that are obtained by the
different proposed methods.

3.1 The Eglin C Inhibitor

Eglin C is a small monomeric protein (70 residues) that belongs
to the Potato Chymotrypsin Inhibitor I family of serine protease
inhibitors that occurs naturally in the Leech Hirudo medicinalis.
Functionally, Eglin C can inhibit more than one proteinase family
with non-homologous structures (Hyberts et (11., 1992). In the
BRENDA database (Scheer et (11., 2011), we found 12 different
EC numbers that are known to be inhibited by this molecule. In
this section, we present the analysis with the ﬁve non-redundant
existing experimental complexes, four of which are Subtilisin-like
and one of which is Trypsin-like.

As explained previously, we use different approaches to ﬁnd the
HP-centroids. The OM has no parameters and it clusters all of the
centroids. With the AC, we must supply the number of clusters
as an input parameter. Figure 2a shows the distributions of mean
PRM and intracluster distances. We observe that PRM is maximized
and intradistance values are stable with 12 clusters. With this
conﬁguration, we obtain ﬁve high-quality clusters according to the

PRM (Fig. 2b). This set of conserved HP-centroids presents a very
high recall value (i.e. they are present in almost all the cross-
inhibition complexes) and ﬁirthermore, there is only one case where
two points in a cluster come from the same complex.

The same experiment was performed using the ﬁne-grained
approach, as presented in Figure 3. At this level of abstraction,
we could not identify a threshold that clearly distinguishes high-
quality clusters from poor-quality ones. Since we aim to ﬁnd as many
conserved HP-centroids as possible, the coarse-grained approach
systematically presents better results. This might indicate that the
cross-inhibition pattern depends on the inhibitor-relative positions
of the conserved HP-centroids regardless of their density.

Table 1 shows the complete set of results. AC performs better,
especially in the coarse-grained analysis, achieving low intra- and
high intercluster distances combined with a very high PRM value
(0.98).

The semantics of the ﬁve hydrophobic patches represented by
the conserved HP-centroids is presented in Figure 4. We can see

why the proposed method reaches an abstraction level that is useful
for identifying relevant cross-inhibition patterns. When we compare
the residues that compose cluster IV, we can see for a Trypsin-like
enzyme the presence of LEU-143, THR-151, ALA-149, TYR-146,
CYS-220, CYS-191 and MET-192. At the counterpart cluster in a
Subtilisin-like enzyme, we ﬁnd PHE-193, ASN-163 and THR-224.
Despite the very dissimilar residue compositions, patch volumes
and densities, the method selects HP-centroids that are spatially
conserved according to the inhibitor. Additional graphs for the other
three samples are presented in the Supplementary Material.

3.2 The Turkey Ovomucoid inhibitor

Ovomucoids are the glycoprotein protease—inhibitors of avian egg
whites. There are several protease inhibitors in egg white. The
Turkey Ovomucoid is from a Kazal-type inhibitor family of serine
protease inhibitors, which occurs naturally in Meleagris gallopavo.
It is a signiﬁcant contaminant of crude Ovomucoid preparations, and
it acts on Bovine Trypsin and Chymotrypsin as well as on Porcine
Elastase and Fungal Proteinase (Fujinaga et (11., 1987; Robertson
et (11., 1988).

We analyze the four non-redundant existing complexes, of
which three have Trypsin-like enzymes and one has Subtilisin-like
enzymes. By conducting similar experiments to those presented in
the previous section, and by varying the number of clusters, we
observe that the mean intradistance stabilizes from four clusters
on. We obtain three high-quality clusters according to the PRM
(Supplementary Material).

Table 2 shows the results for the algorithm comparisons. As in the
previous analysis, AC presents a combination of low intracluster
distances, high intercluster distances and the highest PRM value
(0.94) indicating a consistent match of the patterns.

According to these results, the coarse-grained approach once more
achieved better results than the ﬁne-grained approach.

The three hydrophobic patches that were conserved in the
Ovomucoid complexes are presented in Figure 5. Again, we
can see a very dissimilar cluster composition and an interesting
conservation of position according to the common inhibitor. We
present additional graphs for Ovomucoid cross-inhibition in the
Supplementary Material.

According to Baker and Murphy (1997), hydrophobic interactions
are essential for explaining how inhibition happens in proteases.
Our results are in agreement with this hypothesis. Searching for
conserved abstractions of hydrophobic patches at the atomic level
(HP-centroids) in protease—inhibitor interfaces, we proposed and
evaluated a global and a local algorithm to cluster centroids. We
aimed to ﬁnd conserved centroids at coarse- and ﬁne-grained levels.
We conclude that the coarse-grained AC local algorithm was able to

identify the more complete set of invariant HP-centroids across the
protease—inhibitor cross-inhibition examples.

Certainly, the contribution of polar interactions must be studied
in more detail in ﬁiture work; interestingly, however, we have found
a minimum of three invariant centroids in all cross-inhibition cases.
As proteins are 3D objects, we conjecture that for a molecule to bind
and to hold another one, there must exist at least three non-collinear
contact points. It is possible that the conserved hydrophobic patches
obtained are responsible for binding and holding inhibitors at the
enzyme binding sites.

3.3 The use of HP-centroids for inhibition prediction

Once we have the problem of scarcity of experimental complexes
representing cross-inhibition examples, it is intriguing to ask
whether we can generalize the conserved HP-centroids to binding
sites of apo enzymes of the studied families. We extended the
analysis to a set of non-redundant apo structures of serine proteases
(a list of proteins is in the Supplementary Material). We project
the IFR obtained from the cross-inhibition complexes to the
apo enzymes by using structural alignments, and we verify a
strong conservation of the HP-centroids found through complex
analysis.

Due to the low conservation of residues, it is not possible to
understand how inhibition occurs by examining only sequence-
level conservation (even when sequence alignments are done by

structural alignments as shown in Fig. 6). Notice that we can
ﬁnd some conserved residues (marked with *) that are known to
participate in the catalysis (catalytic triad, oxyanion role) or in the
speciﬁcity binding sites. Apart from these residues, no other interest
conservation can be easily identiﬁed in these logos.

However, our hypothesis is that for inhibition to occur, we must
have very conserved hydrophobic patches in speciﬁc positions to
accommodate each of the inhibitors. For example, PHE-215 in
the Trypsin-like enzymes in Figures 6b and 5b is a voluminous
hydrophobic residue that is equivalent to the hydrophobic portions
of residues in positions LEU-96, ILE-107 and LEU-126 in the
Subtilisin-like enzymes in Figures 6a and 5a. This is an example in
which conserved patterns cannot be inferred from the sequence or
structure but are clearly identiﬁed in our conserved HP-centroid I.

Going further, we believe that these patterns could be used
to predict inhibition for other enzymes for which structures are
available but no experimental evidence of inhibition is known. For
instance, we used eight samples of non-redundant Subtilisin-like
apo enzymes (listed in the Supplementary Material) belonging to
ﬁve different EC numbers (3.4.21.62 / 64 / 66 / 75 / 97). We
considered only those enzymes for which the ECs are complete
with the four levels of annotation. According to the BRENDA
database, three of these are inhibited by Eglin C (3.4.21.62 / 66
/ 75), and we can say that this constitutes successful predictions.
As far as we are concerned, the other two enzymes (3.4.21.64 /
97), which represent Proteinase K and Assemblin Protease, are

Fig. 6. IFR projections of HP-centroids found in serine proteases that are cross-inhibited by Ovomucoid. In (a), we show results for nine non-redundant
superposed Subtilisin-like enzymes (residue numbers according to PDB id 1ROR:E) and in (b) we show results for 35 non-redundant superposed Trypsin-like
enzymes (residue numbers according to PDB id 1PPF:E). On both sides, the bottom logos show the residues that are in the IFR but that are not part of a

conserved cluster.

not mentioned in the literature but present the same pattern as
do the other Subtilisin-like enzymes. It would be very interesting
to verify experimentally whether they can be inhibited by Eglin
C, as they present the same HP-centroids as do other complexes
with this inhibitor. Similar analyses for Ovomucoid are presented
in the Supplementary Material, and we can also verify successful
predictions and several unknown inhibition possibilities.

4 CONCLUSONS

In this work, we model the problem of understanding and predicting
enzyme cross-inhibition. We propose and evaluate algorithms to
detect conserved hydrophobic patch centroids (HP-centroids) to
clarify how these centroids occur in proteases. Our model is based
on the importance of apolar interactions to inhibition in this family
and on the fact that these hydrophobic portions should be studied
at an atomic level. We model the interfaces between enzymes and
inhibitors as graphs of atomic apolar interactions, detect connected
components to represent hydrophobic patches, summarize them
using centroids and show how to obtain as complete a set of
conserved centroids as possible. One of the strengths of the method
is that it achieves the appropriate level of abstraction to detect
the invariant properties involved in cross-inhibition. One of the
main difﬁculties in the study and understanding of this complex
phenomenon through classical methods is that dissimilar sequences
and structures might be inhibited by the same inhibitor. Despite
the lack of conservation at the sequence and structure levels, the
proposed HP-centroids appear to be promising, as they are very
conserved across the studied cases of cross-inhibition.

As we have few non-redundant experimental complexes available,
we test the generality of HP-centroids with a set of non-redundant

apo enzymes representing entire families. By comparing with
experimental data available in the BRENDA database, we also show
some successful examples of how HP-centroids can be used to
predict enzymes that could be inhibited by the studied inhibitors.
Finally, we raise some questions about possible enzymes that might
be inhibited by Eglic C and/or Turkey Ovomucoid and expose them
to further experimental validation.

We believe that this work should be extended to other enzyme
families for which entropic changes are known to be important
factors in inhibition processes. It would also be interesting to
verify whether this method should be used in other problems of
protein—protein interaction pattern detection.

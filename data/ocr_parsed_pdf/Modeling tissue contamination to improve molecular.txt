Minimal Actual

Fig. 2. The random variables at, X, Y and Z represent the tumor propor-
tion, the molecular signature, the site label and the molecular signature of
the contaminating tissue, respectively. A minimal assumption (a) of our
domain adaptation model is that X, Z and at are conditionally independ-
ent, given Y. The actual assumption made (b) is that Z is marginally
independent of the other variables, and that X and at are conditionally
independent, given Y

2.3 Simulation of artiﬁcial core biopsies

The approximate target distribution Tsim is generated as a weighted em-
pirical distribution of a total of M simulated samples. First, the class
labels )1], ..., yM are sampled or chosen. Based on the source dataset
(primary tumors, normal and cirrhotic liver), we sample X1, ..., XM in-
dependently, given )1], ..., yM, such that Xily,» is sampled from the con-
ditional empirical distribution of the source data given y,-. That is, X,- is
drawn with replacement from the source data with class label y,-. In add-
ition, we draw M samples with replacement 2], . . . , 2M, from the contam-
ination data and M samples Cl], . . . ,OlM independently given )1], . . . , yM
such that wily,» has the desired distribution. For a given scale function f,
we compute

ui =f(af1(Xi) + (1 — aiV1(Zi))

and the empirical distribution of the samples (u1,y1), ..., (uM, yM) with
weights w], ..., wM form the approximate target distribution Tsim. The
weights can be chosen to achieve a desired distribution of class labels in
Tsim, for example, to match the distribution of class labels for the primary
tumor dataset. The simulation assumes the conditional independence
structure illustrated in Figure 2b. If the less restrictive conditional inde-
pendence structure illustrated in Figure 2a is assumed, we need to adjust
the simulation to draw 2,- conditionally on y,-, but this requires knowledge
of a class-dependent contamination distribution. Note that the biological
liver core biopsies do not need to completely fulﬁll the assumptions on
which the simulations are based. For our purpose, the usefulness of the
contamination model and the resulting artificial target data is judged by
its ability to improve the performance of the predictor.

2.4 Class prediction

For class prediction, we use multinomial logistic regression, which is the
multiclass extension of logistic regression. The predictor is trained using a
group-lasso penalized likelihood approach as described in detail in
Vincent et a]. (2014).

We brieﬂy review the multinomial group-lasso regression method.
Consider a prediction problem with K classes, N samples and 17 features.
Assume, given a dataset (X1,y1), ..., (XN,yN) where, for all i = 1, .. . , N,
X,» 6 [RP is the observed feature vector, and y,» e {1, . . . , K} is the categor-
ical class label. With h : {1, ...,K} >< [RK —> [R defined as

the (symmetric) multinomial model is given by

P(Y = Ax) = h(l, 5(0) + ﬁx)

liver core biopsies from the none liver-related cancers the numbers a and
b shown as (a/b) are the numbers of low and high tumor content samples,
respectively

Where an, . . . , wN are sample weights. Here, || - Hz is the 27norm on
RK. The penalization results in feature selection, meaning that for some
features the corresponding parameter vector is estimated to be 0. The
regularization parameter A>0 is a tuning parameter, and the larger the
A, the fewer features are selected.

For comparison, we also apply the procedure used in Ferracin et a].
(2011) for class prediction. They used analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
selection of miRNAs, and then prediction analysis of microarrays (PAM)
for the actual prediction; see Ferracin et a]. (2011) for the details.

2.5 Biological samples

A total of 240 samples were included in the study. These samples consist
of 128 resected primary tumors of different origin (representing seven
primary tumor classes), 60 liver core biopsies from metastatic or primary
liver tumors of known origin (representing the same predefined seven
primary tumor classes), 37 liver resections and 15 liver core biopsies
from normal and cirrhotic liver (see Table 1). The five classes breast,
colorectal, gastric/cardia, pancreatic and squamous cell cancers are
referred to as the noniliver-related cancers, and the corresponding 53
liver core biopsies are referred to as the metastatic liver core biopsies.
Samples were obtained from The University Hospital of Copenhagen,
Denmark. The sample set is a subset of the training samples used in
Perell et al. (unpublished data) and available from the Gene Expression
Omnibus with accession number GSE51429. Samples were archived
FFPE tissues (dated 200(P2012). All primary tumor resections were cut
into one section of 10 um and microdissected before being processed to
remove the surrounding benign tissue. Core biopsies were cut into two
sections of 5 um according to the standard pathological procedureino
microdissection was performed. Malignant core biopsy samples were
required to have a minimum tumor content of 10%. Tumor content

was deﬁned as tumor and stromal cells. All samples were from independ-
ent patients; thus, no patient overlap between primary tumor samples and
liver core biopsy samples was accepted. All samples were reviewed by an
independent pathologist to conﬁrm the reference diagnosis and to esti-
mate the proportion of tumor (see Table 2). Based on these tumor per-
centage estimates, the core biopsy samples were divided into two groups
representing high (>50%) and low (<50%) tumor content. For each
sample, the expression levels of 377 miRNAs were measured using quan-
titative real-time PCR (TaqMan low-density array cards, human
MicroRNA array A, Applied Biosystems) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions.

Before a predictor was trained, the artiﬁcial core biopsy data were
simulated and data were preprocessed. Simulation and preprocessing
were executed in the following order.

(1) Controls and miRNAs not expressed in the primary tumor samples
were removed.

(2) Linear and log scale artiﬁcial core biopsies were simulated (see
Section 2.3).

(3) All samples, such as primary tumor samples, core biopsy samples
and the artificial core biopsy samples, were normalized and then
standardized as described below.

The data were ﬁrst normalized by centering and scaling the individual
samples to mean 0 and variance 1. The purpose of normalization is to
remove technical (non-biological) variation. It was demonstrated in
Mestdagh et al. (2009) that for qPCR, mean centering outperforms al-
ternative normalization strategies. Supplementary Figure S2 shows the
effect of the normalization on the sample distribution. To ensure that
differences in scale do not inﬂuence the variable selection, data were
standardized by centering and scaling the expression measurements of
each miRNA across the samples.

The centers and scales were estimated using the primary tumor samples
and applied for standardization of the primary tumor samples as well as
the core biopsy and artiﬁcial core biopsy samples. That is, the standar-
dized sample )2 6 [RP of a sample X 6 [RP is given by

where )1,» and 6,» denote the empirical mean and standard deviation, re-
spectively, for the ith miRNA in the primary tumor dataset. Note that the
order in which normalization and standardization are applied matters.

3 RESULTS

In this section, we present results obtained by testing the sug—
gested domain adaptation method on the miRNA expression
dataset described in Section 2.5. The domain adaptation
method was used with a linear and a log scale contamination
model, as described in Section 2.2. Predictors were constructed
using multinomial group lasso, outlined in Section 2.4, and by
using the ANOVA+PAM method from Ferracin et al. (2011).

Results obtained with and without using the domain adaptation
method were compared.

To assess the generalization ability of the predictor method, a
multinomial group—lasso predictor was trained and cross—
validated solely on the 165 resections. This predictor achieved
an overall lO—fold cross—validation error of 11% on the resected
primary tumors, normal liver and cirrhotic liver samples.
However, on liver core biopsiesiour target domainithis pre—
dictor had an overall test error of ~60%.

Note that results are reported in terms of misclassiﬁcation
percentages of the predictors, which we also refer to as the
errors of the predictors. The errors are either estimated on test
data by cross—validation or by subsampling as described in detail
in the following sections. Furthermore, all errors reported hence—
forth%xcept Section 3.?originate from validation on our
target domain, i.e., samples from one of the following categories:
liver core biopsies of metastatic tumors, liver core biopsies of
primary liver cancers and core biopsies of normal and cirrhotic
liver.

3.1 Predictors based on primary tumor samples

The results presented in this section were obtained using primary
tumor and benign liver resections for training, i.e. no core biopsy
samples were used for training. Errors were estimated solely on
liver core biopsy samples. We compared multinomial group—lasso
predictors obtained by training on one of the following three
datasets:

(a) Primary tumor and benign liver samples.

(b) Artiﬁcial core biopsies obtained using the linear scale con—
tamination model.

(0) Artiﬁcial core biopsies obtained using the log scale con—
tamination model.

For the simulation of artiﬁcial core biopsies, as described in
Section 2.3, we used the 20 normal liver resections as contamin—
ation data. The distribution of at was taken as a beta distribution
with shape parameters (2, 2) for the seven cancer classes, and
degenerate at one for the two benign liver classes. That is, for the
benign liver classes, no contamination was added. The two arti—
ficial core biopsy datasets were generated using either the linear
or the log scale contamination model described in Section 2.2.
The simulation was carried out with 750 samples from each class,
and the weights were chosen as

_ Nprim.
0" _ 750

where, Nprimw is the number of primary samples of class yi. For
the two benign liver classes, the simulation amounts to sampling
with replacement from their empirical distribution. In practice,
the simulation step for these two classes was therefore skipped,
and the 37 benign liver resections were just included, all with
weight 1.

Figure 3 shows the test error plotted against the number of
miRNAs included in the predictor. A larger number of miRNAs
correspond to a lower value of the tuning parameter A in (l). The
predictors trained directly on the primary tumor, normal liver
and cirrhotic liver samples performed poorly when applied to the

Improving molecular identification of the primary tumor site of metastases

 

resections. The improvements of the multinomial group—lasso
predictors were larger than those obtained by the
ANOVA + PAM predictors.

4 DISCUSSION

Contamination of samples can affect the performance of molecu—
lar predictors. This has been reported in other studies (e.g.
Elloumi et al., 2011). In the present article, we have seen that
normal liver contamination hampers primary tumor site identi—
ﬁcation of liver biopsies. This was seen regardless, whether multi—
nomial group lasso or ANOVA + PAM was used.

Several molecular predictors for identiﬁcation of the primary
tumor site have been published, which include Ferracin et al.
(2011), Meiri et al. (2012), Rosenfeld et al. (2008), Lu et al.
(2005) and Ramaswamy et al. (2001). Commonly, these pre-
dictors rely on microdissection to minimize tissue contamination,
and they generally require samples with high tumor content. In
Meiri et al. (2012), a tumor content >60% was required, whereas
33 of the 53 metastatic liver core biopsies in our dataset had a
tumor content <60%. Notably, microdissection may not always
be applied to core biopsies or may cause delay in the diagnostic
work—up.

Previously reported primary tumor site predictors commonly
result in misclassiﬁcation percentages of ~25730%. The pre—
dictor reported in Meiri et al. (2012) was validated on the com—
bination of 334 primary and 146 metastatic tumor samples, with
the samples being a mixture of resections and biopsies. A correct
single prediction was reported for 74% of the samples, corres—
ponding to a misclassiﬁcation percentage of 26%. The
ANOVA + PAM predictor reported in Ferracin et al. (2011) ob—
tained a misclassiﬁcation percentage of 27% when tested on 45
microdissected metastases. Furthermore, Ferracin et al. (2011)
reported a misclassiﬁcation percentage of 31% when this pre—
dictor was applied to the data from Rosenfeld et al. (2008). In
the present article, we show, how an ANOVA + PAM predictor
exclusively trained on primary tumor, normal and cirrhotic liver
samples, results in a misclassiﬁcation percentage of 77% when
validated on the 53 metastatic liver core biopsies. Hence, the
ANOVA+PAM predictor is, like the multinomial group—lasso
predictor, not able to generalize well from the primary tumor
samples to non—microdissected metastatic liver core biopsies
with a heterogenous tumor content distribution. We did not
ﬁnd that any of the previous studies systematically addressed
the problem of identifying primary tumor site of non—microdis—
sected core biopsies. Addressing this problem, we found that
novel methodology was needed to explicitly incorporate tissue
contamination.

We have developed a computational approach that deals with
tissue contamination from surrounding tissue, and we have
shown that the method improves the performance of the molecu—
lar predictor. Notably, training of such predictors does not re—
quire metastatic samples from the speciﬁc biopsy site, e. g. liver.
Comparable improvements could be obtained by including liver
core biopsies in the training data for each of the noniliver—related
classes. Moreover, including liver core biopsies in combination
with the contamination model was shown to reduce the error
even further. With a sufﬁciently large number of metastatic
liver core biopsies, the improvement because of the

contamination model is likely to be small. However, an advan—
tage of the contamination model is that it reduces the number of
metastatic samples from the speciﬁc biopsy site needed for train—
ing. Combining the contamination model with 20 core biopsies,
the misclassiﬁcation percentage of the non—microdissected meta—
static liver core biopsies was reduced to 34%.

Although we only considered liver core biopsies in the present
article, it is natural to assume that our contamination model will
work for other biopsy sites as well. With a limited number of
benign tissue resections, representing the biopsy site of interest,
our contamination model could easily be used to develop a pre—
dictor adapted to core biopsies of other metastatic sites. In add—
ition, even though we only address tissue contamination, our
contamination model has the potential to be used to model back—
ground contamination in other types of samples.

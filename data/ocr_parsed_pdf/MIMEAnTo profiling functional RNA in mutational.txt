Abstract

Summary: The mutational interference mapping experiment (MIME) is a powerful method that,
coupled to a bioinformatics analysis pipeline, allows the identification of domains and structures in
RNA that are important for its function. In MIME, target RNAs are randomly mutated, selected by
function, physically separated and sequenced using next—generation sequencing (NGS).
Quantitative effects of each mutation at each position in the RNA can be recovered with statistical
certainty using the herein developed user—friendly, cross—platform software MIMEAnTo (MIME
ﬁalysis Eol).

Availability and implementation: MIMEAnTo is implemented in C++ using the boost library as
well as Qt for the graphical user interface and is distributed under GPL (http://www.gnu.org/Ii
cences/gpl). The libraries are statically linked in a stand alone executable and are not required on
the system. The plots are generated with gnuplot. Gnuplot—iostream (https://github.com/dstahlke/
gnuplot—iostream) serves as gnuplot interface. Standalone executables including examples and
source code can be downloaded from https://github.com/maureensmith/MIMEAnTo.

analyzed RNA: i.e. a mutation that does not affect selection is not
required for the function of the RNA. Since NGS—reads R from the

MIME experiment are confounded by errors introduced during li—

RNA has long been believed to mainly serve as a blueprint for proteins.
However, a large diversity of so called noncoding RNAs have been dis—

covered lately to regulate v1rtually all cellular processes (Wan et (11., brary preparation and sequencing (see Fig. 1, upper panel), error

pertise. To overcome these obstacles we recently developed MIME
(Smyth et (11., 2015), where RNA is randomly mutated, selected—by—
function (e.g. binding to a protein), physically separated and sequenced
using NGS. Consequently, quantitative effects of mutations at every
nucleotide position can be recovered after a single experiment.

Fig. 1. The MIMEAnTo software identifies functional domains in RNA from MIME data. Top, left: In MIME, a target RNA is (a) randomly mutated, (b) subjected to
selection and physically separated into selected and non-selected fractions. (0) Both pools are sequenced using NGS. Right: Sequence reads are aligned to the
reference RNA. Base counts for each pair of positions (i, I) serve as input for MIMEAnTo. Bottom, left: Raw mutation frequencies are depicted allowing for plausi-
bility checks. Middle: Inter-experimental differences in position- and mutation specific error estimates are explored. Right: Quality criteria can be entered and
quantification of effects, including statistical ascertainment is provided, as well as output functions

type residue at position / 9E i and IE](rcw_.m denotes the expected
probability of falsely detecting a wild type at position i as a mutant
m, which is used for error—correction.

In this note, we present the user—friendly cross—platform software
MIMEAnTo, which evaluates MIME data, following error—correction,
statistical ascertainment and quality assessment. Mathematical founda—
tions and a user—manual are provided as Supplementary Texts.

MIMEAnTo has a wizard—like graphical user interface, guiding
through the data analysis procedure in three steps: (i) data input and
assessment, (ii) sequencing and reverse transcription error correction
and (iii) quantification of raw effects and quality filtering. Note be—
cause RNA is structurally ﬂexible, our method is unique as it allows
to characterize functionally relevant structure(s) of the RNA, which
can inform fundamental research, as well as drug design.

2 Usage

Input: MIMEAnTo takes plain text files with absolute nucleotide 0c—
currences in the selected— and non—selected samples, captured with
different experimental conditions, as input. Two types of files are
required: (i) simple input tables count the number of A, C, G and U
at each position and are used for plausibility checks (Fig. 1, bottom
left). (ii) extended input tables count all non—redundant combin—
ations of two positions (1', /) filling an array containing the number
of dinucleotide occurrences for each pair of positions (number of
AA, AC,. . .UG and UU). The latter is used for error correction, for
inferring the effect of mutations on protein binding and statistical
ascertainment. A program for parsing SAM files is provided on the
project webpage. A first plausibility check of the data (step I) show—
ing the gross mutation rates of each sample provides the opportunity
to interactively validate the data (Fig. 1, bottom left).

Error correction: Sequencing and reverse transcription can produce
errors. In particular, the actual mutation frequencies in the samples
need to exceed these errors (signal—to—noise ratio). The MIME work—

ﬂow incorporates control experiments with wild type libraries allowing
the quantification of this error for each position and mutation. The
errors are explored in step II of the pipeline (Fig. 1, bottom center).

Quantiﬁcation, filtering & output: In step IH raw error—corrected
effects can be quantified using eq. (1). Simultaneously, for each re—
sampled effect at nucleotide positions (1', j), a signal—to—noise ratio Dmﬁw
(i,/') is derived. This step is only performed once (runtime 0(L2)),
where L denotes the length of the functional RNA. Next, the user can
provide several quality criteria for filtering the results: (i) a minimum
signal—to—noise ratio Dm,w(i, /) and (ii) two criteria ensuring a meaning—
ful re—sampling. An absolute minimum coverage and a threshold that
ensures that the coverage for each pair of positions (1', /) exceeds a given
percentage of the total coverage at position 1'. Guidelines for choosing
the exact values are provided in the Supplementary Text.

The results are then filtered and publication—ready graphics gen—
erated showing (i) the  (i, *) distribution of each individual mu—
tation m at each position-i and (ii) the %(i, *) distribution for

 

only the maximum effect mutation mmax with significant effects
highlighted (Fig. 1, bottom right). Results and graphics can be ex—
ported in csv or eps and pdf format respectively.

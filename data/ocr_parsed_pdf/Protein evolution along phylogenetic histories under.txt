Protein evolution along phylogenetic histories

 

testing these evolutionary features to be able to address wider
biological questions.

In this study, we have implemented structurally constrained
substitution models (hereafter, SCS models) that allow for site—
dependent substitutions, under neutral and non—neutral ﬁtness
landscapes that depend on protein stability, in the freely avail—
able computer program ProteinEvolver, which is able to simulate
the evolution of proteins and protein—coding genes along evolu—
tionary histories such as phylogenetic trees or ancestral recom—
binant graphs (ARGs). These phylogenetic histories can be
speciﬁed by the user or simulated through the coalescent with
recombination, demographics and migration (see the reviews,
Nordborg, 2007; Wakeley, 2008). Recently, Grahnen and
Liberles introduced the computer program CASS that simulates
protein sequence evolution under selection to fold into a speciﬁc
conformation (Grahnen and Liberles, 2012). Our program differs
from CASS in two main aspects: the representation of the pro—
tein structure, which inﬂuences the way in which we treat mis—
folding stability, and the possibility to represent a broad variety
of demographic and evolutionary scenarios (for instance, varying
recombination rates and mutation). Grahnen and Liberles adopt
explicit side chain representation, and we also adopt contact
matrices, which are less precise but allow a statistical mechanical
treatment of the ensemble of misfolded conformations that is
computationally affordable (and actually very fast with our ap—
proximation) (e. g. Bastolla et al., 2005a,b). Misfolding stability is
important because, if only the unfolded state is considered, se—
lection tends to artiﬁcially favor very hydrophobic sequences.
Therefore, the structural approach taken by the two programs
is complementary, and each of them may be suited to address
different kinds of biological questions.

Through extensive simulations, we compared the SCS models
with commonly used empirical amino acid substitution models
using as a benchmark 10 well—known protein families. We found
that sequences simulated under our SCS models produce amino
acid distributions closer to the observed ones. Furthermore, the
folding stability of the native state, assessed by building struc—
tural models by homology and predicting their stability with a
method different from the one adopted in the simulations, is
significantly larger for proteins simulated under the SCS
model. We conclude that substitution models that incorporate
protein structure information are better approximations to the
real evolutionary process and may provide more meaningful evo—
lutionary inferences than site—independent substitution models.

2 METHODS AND ALGORITHMS

We simulate protein evolution in two main steps. First, the ge—
nealogy is either speciﬁed by the user or it is simulated using the
coalescent optionally modiﬁed with recombination, migration
and demographics. Second, protein—coding genes and protein
sequences are evolved along this genealogy under a given substi—
tution or replacement model.

2.1 Simulation of genealogies

Genealogies are simulated according to the standard coales—
cent process (Kingman, 1982) modiﬁed with recombination
(Hudson, 1983), demographics and migration (Hudson, 1998).

Recombination can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous
(recombination hotspots and coldspots) across the sequence fol—
lowing the algorithm developed by Wiuf and Posada (2003).
Note that the simulation of recombination events leads to reticu—
late nodes and, consequently, to an ARG (Grifﬁths and
Marjoram, 1997). Demographics include growth rate and demo—
graphic periods by following the algorithms implemented in
Arenas and Posada (2007, 2010a). Gene ﬂow among subpopula—
tions can be speciﬁed under island, stepping—stone or continenti
island migration models (e.g. Hudson, 1998). In addition,
longitudinal samples or population/species trees, among
other capabilities, can also be speciﬁed (see Supplementary
Table S1).

2.2 Evolution of proteins along phylogenies

After the phylogenetic history has been speciﬁed, a protein struc—
ture and a sequence are assigned to the root (the most recent
common ancestor or grand most recent common ancestor in case
of recombination). Then, the protein is evolved along the phyl—
ogeny going forward in time from the root to the tips (see Yang,
2006) according to the SCS model, generating a protein for all
internal and terminal nodes in the phylogeny.

Overall, for a given branch, the SCS models perform five steps.

(i) The number of mutations or substitutions is computed
considering the branch length (number of expected substi—
tutions without considering structural constraints) and the
length of the protein (number of amino acids).

(ii) A mutation is introduced according to the instantaneous
rate matrix (the relative rates of change can be used to
determine mutational sites).

(iii) The folding free energy of the mutated protein structure is
computed.

(iv) The selective effect of the mutation is evaluated; it will
be accepted or rejected depending on the ﬁxation prob—
ability associated with the change of fitness (see next
section).

(v) If the mutation is rejected, the process goes to step (ii)
and a new mutation is introduced. If the mutation is
accepted, then the mutation is fixed and it becomes a
substitution.

The five—step process is repeated until the number of mutations
or substitutions (i) is completed. In this way, ﬁxed mutations
(substitutions) result in differences among proteins from different
evolutionary lineages.

2.2.1 Substitution models based on the stability of the protein
structure

2.2.1.1 Evaluation of the structural stability of mutated
proteins. We evaluate the folding stability of a given mutated
protein taking into account the stability against unfolding and
against misfolding. Initially, we estimate the stability of the
mutated sequence folded into the target structure at the simula—
tion temperature using a contact—based free energy function. The
contact matrix Ci,- takes the value 1 if residues i and j are ‘close’
(<4.5 A) in space and 0 otherwise. This matrix has been shown
sufﬁcient to accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of the

protein (Vendruscolo et al., 1997). We assume that the free
energy of a protein with sequence A folded into the contact
matrix C is given by the sum of its pairwise contact interactions:

E(A, o = Z C[;U(A,~,Aj> (1)
if

where U ( a,b ) is the contact interaction matrix that expresses the
free energy gained when amino acids a and b are brought into
contact determined by Bastolla et al. (1999). For proteins that
fold with two—state thermodynamics, i.e. for which only the
native structure and the unfolded structure are thermodynamic—
ally important, stability against unfolding is defined as the free
energy difference between the folded and the unfolded states,
estimated as AG~E(A,Cnat) +sL. Here Cnat is the native struc—
ture, L is the protein length, s is an entropic parameter and sL is
the free energy of the unfolded state for proteins with two—state
thermodynamics. We use s = 0.074, a value that was determined
ﬁtting the above equation to a set of 20 experimentally measured
unfolding free energies, yielding a correlation coefﬁcient r = 0.92.
The correlation coefﬁcient between the predicted and
the observed stability effect of mutations is larger than 0.8
using only two ﬁt parameters, which is comparable with the
state—of—the—art atomistic methods such as Fold—X (Guerois
et al., 2002).

Stability against unfolding is, however, not sufﬁcient to char—
acterize protein stability. We also have to check the stability
against compact, incorrectly folded conformations of low
energy that can act as kinetic traps in the folding process and,
in many cases, result in pathological aggregations. Stability
against misfolding is achieved by natural proteins by increasing
the energy of key contacts that are frequently found in alterna—
tive structures, which is termed negative design (Berezovsky
et al., 2007; Minning et al., 2013; Noivirt—Brik et al., 2009) to
distinguish it from the positive design that favors protein stability
by strengthening native interactions. Therefore, stability against
misfolding may be inﬂuenced by mutations at positions that are
distant in the native structure. Stability against misfolded struc—
tures is difﬁcult to estimate, and most models of protein evolu—
tion do not consider it despite its importance being increasingly
recognized (Krishna et al., 2004; Mendez et al., 2010; Zheng
et al., 2013). Here we do consider the set of alternative compact
matrices of L residues that can be obtained from non—redundant
structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). This procedure,
called threading, guarantees that the contact matrices fulﬁll phys—
ical constraints on chain connectivity, atomic repulsion and
hydrogen bonding (secondary structure), which are not enforced
in the contact energy function. The free energy of this misfolded
ensemble is often estimated with the Random Energy Model
[REM, (Derrida, 1981)]:

where <E(A,C)> is the mean and 02 is the variance of the energy
of alternative compact structures (Goldstein, 2011a). This
formula holds for temperatures above the freezing temperature
at which the entropy of the misfolding ensemble vanishes. At
lower temperatures, the free energy maintains the same frozen
value (Derrida, 1981). A recent study showed that the third

moment of the energy cannot be neglected (Minning et al.,
2013), so that the free energy of the misfolded ensemble can be
computed as,

value of the contact between the pair of residues i and j in a large
set of compact protein structures of the same length L as the
target structure.

In the present work, we have reduced considerably the com—
putation time approximating the above free energy (Minning
et al., 2013) with one that only depends on pairs of residues,

The quantities A”), Am, A“), 8);), BE?) and B?) only depend on
the set of alternative contact matrices and on protein length L,
and they are pre—computed before the simulation starts. In this
way, we can evaluate how the misfolded free energy changes on
mutation performing only order L operations for computing
U(A,~ = b, A,) — U(A,~ = a, Aj) when the residue at the mutated
site i changes from amino acid a to b. Thus, the stability of the
native state is ﬁnally evaluated as the difference in free energy
between the native, the unfolded and the misfolded states,

The statistical properties of alternative contact matrices are
computed from a large set of protein structures, distributed
with the ProteinEvolver package, that can be modiﬁed by the
user. Supplementary Figure S5 shows the histogram of the
lengths of the alternative structures.

Note that, even if the two conﬁgurational entropies per residue
S” (unfolded ensemble) and St. (misfolded ensemble) act addi—
tively, the free energy may not simply depend on their sum, as
it is only 5,. that determines the freezing temperature of the
misfolded ensemble.

 

2.2.2 Relationship between protein stability and fitness Once we
have defined protein stability, for modeling protein evolution we
still have to deﬁne how protein stability inﬂuences fitness. Our
program provides two alternatives. The simplest possibility is a
neutral fitness landscape where the ﬁtness is a binary variable
and all proteins with stability above a given threshold, i.e.
AG<AGt11r are considered viable and equally ﬁt, whereas all
proteins below threshold are considered lethal and therefore dis—
carded. We choose as threshold the folding free energy of the
protein sequence A0 in the PDB AG)". 2 AG(A0,Cmn). This
choice implies that the neutral SCS model is not sensitive to

realizations under the neutral SCS model and the ﬁtness SCS
model using the representative PDB structure. For both neutral
and fitness SCS models, we explored 27 combinations of the
thermodynamic parameters temperature (T: 1.75, 1.50 and
1.30), conﬁgurational entropy per unfolded residue (su=0.025,
0.05 and 0.075) and conﬁgurational entropy per misfolded resi—
due (sC=0.025, 0.05 and 0.075), performing 11000 simulations.
For the ﬁtness SCS model, we assumed an effective population
size N: 100 (Cruzan, 2001; Oostermeijer et al., 1994). Note that
all substitution models simulated an overall similar number of
substitution events (Supplementary Table S2) because they were
applied along the same branch lengths.

3.1 Analysis of amino acid distributions and inferences of
optimal thermodynamic conditions

We compared the simulated amino acid distributions with those
observed in the original datasets measuring their Kullbacki
Leibler divergence at each site i:

20

(hm = Z Piob‘(a)(10g(P?b‘Y(a)) —10g(1’?"m(a))) (7)

11:1
where a is any of the 20 amino acids. We compute the weighted

sum D KL 2 i widKLJ with weights wl. proportional to the
i=1
number of aligned residues (excluding gaps) in column i of the
alignment and summing up to 1. The smaller the quantity DKL,
the closer the observed and simulated distributions are.
Remarkably, we found that sequences simulated under the
neutral SCS model are always closer to the observed distribution
than sequences simulated under the empirical substitution model
(see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Varying the temperature
or the conﬁgurational entropy parameters did not affect the di—
vergence of the neutral SCS simulations, as it could be expected
because the difference between the estimated AG and the neutral
threshold AGW is independent of the entropic parameter and it
depends only weakly on temperature.

On the other hand, the divergence of the fitness SCS model
clearly depended on the particular thermodynamic parameters
(see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). The average agreement
between predicted and observed site—speciﬁc amino acid distri—
butions in the fitness SCS model reached a minimum for the
combination of entropic and temperature parameters (see
Supplementary Fig. S3, minimum in the left plot), where its
value was similar to the one produced by the neutral model
that used as threshold the free energy of the sequence in the
PDB (Supplementary Fig. S3, right). These optimal thermo—
dynamic parameters were achieved for T ( s,,+sC) =0.16.
Interestingly, for some protein families, the ﬁtness SCS model
with optimal parameters was signiﬁcantly less divergent from the
observed distribution than the neutral SCS model (see Fig. 2).
However, for some protein families the fitness SCS model with
the ‘worst’ parameter values had a similar divergence from the
observed sequences as the empirical substitution models. These
findings indicate that the neutral SCS model is more robust, and
suggest that it should be used by default, whereas the ﬁtness SCS
model may be used for refinement with well—calibrated thermo—
dynamic parameters, as shown in Supplementary Figure S3
(left). Comparisons between real sequence families, SCS simula—
tions and simulations based on empirical amino acid substitution
models are shown as sequence logos in Supplementary Figure S6.

3.2 Structural assessment of the simulated proteins with
respect to the real proteins

We also assessed how much a simulated protein sequence ﬁts a
representative protein structure of its family by using homology
modeling techniques (Marti—Renom et al., 2000). For each protein
family, 200 sequences simulated under the neutral SCS model and
under the best—ﬁt empirical site—independent substitution model
were modeled using the Modeller software (Eswar et al., 2006; Sali
and Blundell, 1993). For each simulated sequence, 20 structural
models were generated, and they were assessed through their dis—
crete optimized protein energy (DOPE) score (Shen and Sali,
2006), an effective energy function designed for selecting the
best model built by Modeller. Note that this energetic score is

experiences change is inﬂuenced by replacements at neighboring
sites. To adequately model these correlations, we developed the
simulation framework ProteinEvolver that integrates structure—
based models of protein evolution and evolutionary histories
that can be simulated under diverse evolutionary scenarios
such as recombination (including hotspots and coldspots), mi—
gration and demographics. Importantly, our SCS models con—
sider both the stability against unfolding and the stability against
misfolding, which is difﬁcult to estimate, as it requires the use of
a set of alternative conformations, and it is frequently neglected
in simulations of protein evolution despite the importance of
negative design. Moreover, our approximation of the free
energy of the misfolded state (Minning et al., 2013) allows us
to estimate the effect of each mutation on both unfolding and
misfolding performing a number of computations that grow only
linearly with the number of amino acids. As a consequence, these
models can be applied along long phylogenetic histories.

The recently developed CASS tool (Grahnen and Liberles,
2012) can simulate protein sequence evolution accounting for se—
lection to fold into a speciﬁc conformation. CASS is based on an
explicit side chain representation of the protein, which can make
it more accurate than our contact matrix—based method (although
it is known that contact matrices allow reconstruction of all atom
coordinates with precision), and with treatment of the misfolded
ensemble, which is important to avoid bias toward hydrophobic
sequences that are often unrealistically favored by energy func—
tions. However, additional considerations in the latter might
avoid this effect. An important characteristic of CASS, not
included in our program, is that it allows selecting for structures
that bind a target molecule, therefore allowing investigation of an
important aspect of protein function [which is, nevertheless, in—
timately related with structural stability (e.g. Lukatsky et al.,
2007)].

Another important feature of our framework, which is not
present in the CASS approach, is that it allows modeling evolu—
tionary mechanisms other than point mutations, such as recom—
bination, which has been shown to be a key element in protein
engineering (Carbone and Arnold, 2007) and could affect struc—
tural constraints (Archer et al., 2008; Simon—Loriere et al., 2009).
For example, Xu et al. (2005) have shown that recombination
may inﬂuence structural divergence. In addition, we can simulate
molecular evolution in population genetics scenarios, including
demographics, population structure and migration, which allows
us to address a wide range of biological problems by investigat—
ing how these evolutionary scenarios inﬂuence the properties of
the evolved sequences by altering the underlying genealogies and
the properties of the substitution process, which in non—neutral
ﬁtness landscapes strongly depend on population size. On the
other hand, including or ignoring structural considerations can
affect population genetic inferences (i.e. inferences on recombin—
ation, demographics or migration).

We assessed the performance of the SCS models versus more
traditional empirical replacement matrices. For all 10 protein
families studied and tested combinations of temperature and
configurational entropy parameters, the neutral SCS model
always simulated sequences with amino acid frequencies closer
to the observed ones than the best—ﬁt empirical amino acid re—
placement model. On the other hand, the ﬁtness SCS model may
outperform the neutral model under optimal thermodynamic

parameters, but it is very sensitive to the correct choice of par—
ameters. Consequently, we recommend the use of the neutral
SCS substitution model by default because it is more robust,
whereas the ﬁtness SCS model should be only used with the
default thermodynamic parameters, in which case it may simu—
late more realistic proteins for some protein families. This differ—
ence stems from the fact that the non—neutral model optimizes
protein stability when the population size is large, and it may
bias the evolutionary process if the thermodynamic model is not
reliable. On the other hand, we think that this dependence on
parameters is reassuring, as it shows that the agreement between
observed and simulated distributions that ProteinEvolver
achieves is not a trivial result.

The beneﬁts of using the SCS substitution models instead of
the empirical substitution models were also observed by evaluat—
ing the adequacy between the simulated sequence and its best
homology model with the DOPE energy. In particular, we found
that the DOPE energy from proteins simulated by the SCS neu—
tral model was always more negative (more stable 3D proteins)
than proteins simulated under the empirical substitution model,
although, not surprisingly, less negative than the energy of the
experimentally observed sequence—structure pair. These findings
were expected because the empirical models consider independ—
ent sites, and therefore they are unable to account for physical
interactions that promote stability (e.g. Pollock et al., 2012;
Rodrigue et al., 2005). Nevertheless, they constitute a minimal
test that indicates the consistency of SCS models and confirms
the limitation of empirical substitution matrices.

The consideration of structural information should result in
more sensitive and more accurate representations of molecular
evolution than those based on sequence data alone (Wilke,
2012). Our structure—based models could help for a more realistic
benchmarking of methods trying to take into account site depend—
ency induced by protein structure (e.g. Grahnen et al., 2011;
Nasrallah et al., 2011) and the important inﬂuences of the un—
folded and misfolded conﬁgurations on the protein stability
(Bastolla and Demetrius, 2005; Mendez et al., 2010; Zheng
et al., 2013). At the population level, the framework may help,
e.g. (i) to evaluate the range of proteins that one may expect to
observe in different populations (where these populations can
change their sizes with time and can exchange migration), (ii) to
validate analytical frameworks (e. g. methods for the inference of
ARGs, ancestral protein reconstruction, recombination break—
points and recombination rates, from proteins or protein—coding
genes while accounting for structural constrains) or even (iii) to
infer evolutionary parameters of interest and carry out model
choice in an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach
(Beaumont et al., 2002); e.g. estimate recombination rates or
select among different demographic and migration models from
protein data while accounting for structural information. At the
molecular level, the framework may help, for example, to study
the inﬂuence of recombination events on the structure—based
stability of the resulting proteins or to perform structurally
constrained substitution model choice by using ABC.

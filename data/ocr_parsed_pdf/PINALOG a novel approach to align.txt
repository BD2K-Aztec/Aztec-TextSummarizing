ABSTRACT

Motivation: Analysis of protein—protein interaction networks (PPle)
at the system level has become increasingly important in
understanding biological processes. Comparison of the interactomes
of different species not only provides a better understanding of
species evolution but also helps with detecting conserved functional
components and in function prediction.

Method and Results: Here we report a PPIN alignment
method, called PINALOG, which combines information from protein
sequence, function and network topology. Alignment of human
and yeast PPle reveals several conserved subnetworks between
them that participate in similar biological processes, notably the
proteasome and transcription related processes. PINALOG has
been tested for its power in protein complex prediction as well
as function prediction. Comparison with PSI-BLAST in predicting
protein function in the twilight zone also shows that PINALOG is
valuable in predicting protein function.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in the quantity of
protein—protein interactions (PPIs) being detected by experimental
methods. The analysis of PPI networks (PPINs) at the system
level has become increasingly important in understanding biological
processes. Comparison of the interactomes of different species
not only provides a better understanding of species evolution but
also helps with detecting conserved functional components and in
function prediction.

Several methods have been developed to align interactomes,
both globally and locally, most of which use sequence similarity
or network topology or both in establishing the equivalence.
PathBLAST (Kelley et al., 2003) marked the ﬁrst local alignment
method and was similar in principle to the BLAST search algorithm.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Other local alignment methods include: NetworkBLAST (Sharan
et (11., 2005), which is the next generation of PathBLAST; MaWISH
(Koyutiirk et al., 2006), which adopts the evolutionary models
of match, mismatch and deletion of the proteins; Graemlin 1.0
(Flannick et al., 2006), which infers an alignment from network
modules; the Bayesian method (Berg and Lassig, 2006); the match
and split algorithm (Narayanan and Karp, 2007); and Phunkee
(Cootes et al., 2007), which aligns proteins based on sequence
and context in the networks. The global alignment of networks
proves to be more Challenging due to the complexity and scale
of the problem. Graemlin 2.0 (Flannick et al., 2009) formulates a
model for protein duplication, deletion and mutation and aligns the
network progressively using a hill-Climbing algorithm. The Markov-
random ﬁeld-based method (Bandyopadhyay, 2006) and IsoRank
(Singh et al., 2008) solve the problem by eigenvalue-based methods.
GRAAL (Kuchaiev et al., 2010) uses only the network topological
similarity to align the networks using a seed-and-extend method for
graph alignment.

In many applications of PPIN alignment, the underlying objective
is to equivalence proteins with related function and interacting
partners. However, in most alignment methods only the sequence
data or network topology are used to align the input networks despite
the availability of other sources of information such as function
annotation or gene expression. While sequences are informative
in elucidating the orthologous relationships of proteins across
species, they do not necessarily indicate functional similarity. The
omission of function information could therefore result in many
pairs of equivalenced proteins having little or no similarity of
function. This in turn makes it less accurate in detecting conserved
functional modules or predicting protein function. Recently, Ali
and Deane (2009) have introduced functional similarity of proteins
into a local alignment method. They used functional similarity
in combination with sequence similarity in the local alignment
match and split algorithm (Narayanan and Karp, 2007) and
identiﬁed similar functional subnetworks. The recently developed
method MI-GRAAL (Kuchaiev and Przulj, 2011) presents a
global alignment algorithm in which different information can be
incorporated such as topological features, sequence similarity and
functional similarity. However, there has been no assessment on how
the inclusion of functional similarity might inﬂuence the resulting
alignments and any subsequent applications.

Here we describe PINALOG, a global network alignment
algorithm. PINALOG forms the alignment between two PPINs
based on the similarities of protein sequence and the protein function
between the two networks. Functional similarity is formalized

using GO (gene ontology) annotations. The main contributions
in PINALOG are the use of communities in the networks to
identify seed protein pairs and the scoring schemes used in the
extension steps to include the neighbourhood similarity of mapped
protein pairs. The benchmarking of PINALOG in comparison
with other alignment methods shows that PINALOG obtains
a good balance in including these features as it generates an
alignment with consistently high number of conserved interactions,
homologous aligned pairs and functionally similar protein pairs.
Direct applications of PINALOG include protein complex prediction
and protein function prediction. Complex prediction is performed by
direct inheritance of protein complex data from a known species to
an unknown one. PINALOG has been tested for complex prediction
power using a human-yeast alignment. Protein function prediction
is via direct transfer to an un-annotated protein from an annotated
protein. The power of our function prediction is assessed in a
cross-validated study.

2 METHODS

The design of the PINALOG alignment method is based on the observation
that proteins are not uniformly distributed throughout PPINs. Instead there
are some proteins that form well connected subnetworks. Furthermore. it
has been shown by Brohee and van Helden (2006) that protein complexes
and functional modules form highly connected components in the PPINs.
Therefore. it would be more reliable and efﬁcient to align two PPINS by ﬁrst
ﬁnding highly similar protein pairs (seed protein pairs) from these highly
connected protein subnetworks (referred to as communities from now on)
in the networks and then extending the alignment to other proteins in the
neighbourhoods of seed protein pairs.

LetA and B be the PPINS for species A and B. a, and b]- are the i-th and j-th
proteins in PPIN A and B. respectively. C? is the i-th community in PPIN A.
and Cin” is the j-th community in B. PINALOG aligns A and Bin three steps
as summarized in Figure 1: community detection. community mapping and
extension mapping.

Step 1: Community detection of input networks using CFinder

Communities in biological networks such as PPINS often indicate functional
groupings of proteins in the network (Adamcsek et al.. 2006; Lewis
et al.. 2010; Song and Singh. 2009). There are several methods to detect
communities within a network such as the minimum-cut method. hierarchical
clustering or the GirvaniNewman algorithm. In PINALOG. we employ
CFinder (Palla et al.. 2005). a clique percolation method. which is capable
of detecting overlapping communities. Denote a k-clique as a subgraph of
the network composed of k proteins where all pairs of proteins interact. Then
a k-clique community is deﬁned as union of all k-cliques that are reachable
from each other through adjacent k-cliques (two adjacent k-cliques have k—l
proteins in common). CFinder constructs communities by merging adjacent
k-cliques (see Supplementary Material for more details).

Node scoring scheme

The similarity between two proteins is a combination of sequence and
functional similarity in the seed identiﬁcation and with additional topological
similarity in the extension mapping process. The sequence similarity of two
proteins a, and b]- is calculated based on their BLAST bit score as
3(aivbj)

x/S(aivai)s(ijbj)
S(ai,bj) is the BLAST bit score value when aligning a, and 171-. Here. only
pairs of proteins with an E-Value <10‘5 are used to calculate sequence
similarity.

The functional similarity of two proteins annotated with G0 terms is
calculated by the method deﬁned by Schlicker et al. (2006). Given two

Fig. 1. PINALOG global alignment method comprises of three main steps:
(i) Community detection: identiﬁes dense subnetworks of input networks
using CFinder (e.g. red and blue 3. 4 and 5-node subnetworks in the lower
part of the diagram). (ii) Community mapping: maps similar communities
that have high similarity scores. i.e. containing many inter-species proteins
with high similarity scores. In the ﬁrst table (lower part of the diagram).
mapped communities with high similarity scores are marked in red numbers.
Similar protein pairs from mapped communities are extracted to form a list
of core pairs. (iii) Extension mapping: maps proteins in the neighbourhood
of the core protein pairs which are then added to the core. e.g. protein I
mapped with X and H with Y in the second table in the lower part of the
diagram. Extension mapping is repeated until no more pair is added.

proteins a, and b]- with two sets of associated GO terms g(ai)={t1,t2.. . ..tk}
and g(bj)={t/1 .t/2.. . ..t/l }. the protein functional similarity is calculated based
on the semantic similarity (Lord et al.. 2003) of terms in g(ai) and g(bj).
Semantic similarity depends on the rarity of the terms in the annotation
database as well as their distance in the ontology. The semantic similarity
between each term in g(ai) and each term in g(bj) is calculated. resulting
in a k ><l table of semantic similarities. Let rowScore and colScore be the
average of the row maxima and the average of column maxima in the
table. respectively (see Supplementary Fig. SI-l). the Schlicker’s similarity
between a, and b]- is then calculated as

Sfunc(ai, 17]) = max{rowScore.colScore} (2)

The similarity of two proteins in Step (2) is deﬁned as a linear combination
of functional similarity and sequence similarity

S(aiv bf) = 9>Vseq(aivbj)+(1— 9)Srunc(ai w bj) (3)

In PINALOG. 6 provides a relative weighting between sequence and
functional similarity. The value of 6 is automatically decided based on the
number of reciprocal best BLAST hits in the protein sequences between two
input species. reﬂecting the closeness of two species and thus the contribution
of sequence similarity in the overall score. Details of how 6 is calculated are
given in Supplementary Material.

Step 2: Community mapping to obtain seed protein pairs

Community mapping is determined in two steps. The ﬁrst step is to determine
the highest score when equivalencing proteins in each community in species
A with each community in species B. To this end. we deﬁne the similarity
between two communities as the score F (Cfﬂf). the sum of similarities
between protein pairs in the optimal equivalence (OptMap) of proteins in
community C? in species A with proteins in C15 in species B using the
Hungarian method (Kuhn. 2005). The optimal equivalence is the mapping
where the sum of protein pair similarities is largest. The Hungarian algorithm

The ﬁrst step produces a community similarity matrix. This matrix is used in

the second step to obtain the best equivalence of communities by maximizing
the community scoring function:

F(cf, C?) (5)

The maximization of F (core) is achieved by Hungarian method based on
the community similarity matrix. For each pair of mapped communities. the
Hungarian mapping of proteins between them are obtained and added to
the list of seed protein pairs. A ﬁltering step is used to retain only the top
15% pairs of mapped proteins as the seeds for extension. known as the core
equivalences.

Step 3: Extension mapping

Extension mapping is performed by considering neighbours of proteins in
the core equivalence as candidates for adding to the alignment. In addition
to protein sequence and functional similarity. topological similarity in the
PPINS is included in the form of neighbourhood similarity. Let N (a,) and
N (bf) be the set of all ﬁrst neighbours (proteins separated by one interaction)
and second neighbours (proteins separated by two interactions) of a, in A
and b]- in B. Let d(ak,al) denote the distance between ak and a, in a network.
The similarity between a, and b]- in extension mapping is then deﬁned as

By awarding the candidate pairs with a proportion of the score of
neighbouring aligned pairs. PINALOG aims at mapping more neighbouring
protein pairs. The Hungarian method is used to ﬁnd the optimal equivalence
of candidates. These candidates are then added to the equivalences in the core.
The process is repeated until no more pairs are added (see Supplementary
Fig. SI-l). As CFinder identiﬁes communities that can be overlap. community
mapping can result in many-to-many mappings in seed protein pairs. thus in
the ﬁnal alignment.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Alignment of human PPIN with other species

We have aligned different pairs of PPINs from human, yeast, ﬂy,
worm and mouse using: PINALOG; two state-of—the-art alignment
methods Isorank and Graemlin 2.0, the integrative method MI-
GRAAL and the naive BLAST approach by reciprocal best BLAST
hit (denoted as BLAST). The PPINs of these species were obtained
from IntAct (Aranda et al., 2010) and aligned by both PINALOG
and IsoRank. Graemlin 2.0 requires a training set to leam the
parameters for the alignment. Thus comparison with Graemlin can
only be made using the data set in the package, which provides
PPINs of ﬂy and yeast (denoted as ﬂy2 and yeast2). As IsoRank
and MI-GRAAL generate alignments with one-to-one mapping, for
ease of comparison we reduce the ﬁnal alignment of PINALOG to
a one-to-one mapping (see Supplementary Material).

The aim of PINALOG is to obtain the best equivalence
considering a balance of sequence homology, ﬁinctional similarity

and network topology. Thus one would expect differences in the
alignment generated by a purely sequence-based approach and one
from a network strategy such as PINALOG. However, there is
no gold standard with which to compare the results, so we need
to consider a range of metrics. Accordingly, in Table 1 and in
Supplementary Material, we report NA, the number of aligned
protein pairs; NC, the number of conserved interactions; NH, the
number of protein pairs belonging to the same Homologene groups
(Wheeler et al., 2005); NI, the number of interlogs (Walhout et al.,
2000); and NF, the number of aligned protein pairs with functional
similarity >0.5. Conserved interactions are interactions occurring
in both species when two protein nodes forming an interaction in
one species are equivalenced to two protein nodes which also form
an interaction in the other species. NH is a common measure of
alignment quality, counting the number of protein pairs belonging
to the same homologous groups identiﬁed by the Homologene
algorithm. ‘Interlog’ refers to an orthologous pair of interacting
proteins between different species. We use the deﬁnition of interlog
by Yu, et al. (2004) to quantify NI. Both NH and NI describe
the sequence similarity of protein pairs in the alignments. If the
functional similarity between two proteins is >0.5, their ﬁinctions
are considered related (Schlicker et al., 2006), hence NF.

3.1.] Human and yeast alignment results We consider the results
of aligning the two species with the most abundant PPI information,
human and yeast. The values of NA and NC indicate the scale of
the alignment. However, since some of these equivalences may not
be biologically relevant, one cannot use NA or NC as an accuracy
metric. The large difference between NC for PINALOG (3319)
and IsoRank (717) highlights that markedly different alignments
are obtained. This is the result of extending the alignment from
the seed protein pairs in PINALOG. PINALOG and MI-GRAAL
have similar values for NC. BLAST ﬁnds far less aligned pairs and
conserved edges than PINALOG consistent with the objective of
network alignment in establishing more equivalences than a purely
sequence-based method.

Table 1 also shows that PINALOG ﬁnds far more pairs of aligned
proteins with a ﬁinctional similarity >0.5 than IsoRank, MI-GRAAL
and BLAST. This is consistent with PINALOG including functional
similarity in its equivalence. The histograms of ﬁinctional similarity
of mapped protein pairs in different methods (see Supplementary

Fig. SI-3) shows the improved performance of PINALOG over
MI-GRAAL in identifying functionally similar pairs.

The number of Homologenes (NH) is substantially higher using
PINALOG (454 pairs) compared with IsoRank (165 pairs) and
MI-GRAAL (0) although all methods have roughly the same
number aligned pairs. Although a network-based alignment which
considers interaction topology and ﬁinction need not equivalence
every Homologene pair, one would expect that many Homologene
pairs are captured in the alignment. This suggests that more of the
aligned pairs are biologically meaningful in PINALOG compared
with IsoRank and MI-GRAAL. BLAST ﬁnds more Homologenes
(NH) than PINALOG (and IsoRank) despite having less total
equivalences (NA). Homologenes are identiﬁed mainly by two-way
sequence similarity (blastp) of proteins in different species species
together with other information such as phylogeny and synteny.
Since network-based methods equivalence pairs of protein together
with their interaction edge, one would expect that a sequence method
would identify more Homologenes than a network-based approach.

The PINALOG alignment has 3.5 times as many interlogs
(NI) as IsoRank (460 versus136) while MI-GRAAL fails to ﬁnd
any. This indicates that PINALOG ﬁnds many interlogs between
species, which along with conserved interactions, might contribute
to the ﬁinctional similarity of PPINs across species. BLAST
ﬁnds a few more interlogs than PINALOG (465 compared with
460). Considering one-to-one mapping of networks, we can take
the NI of BLAST as the maximal number obtainable. Clearly
PINALOG found most of these whereas IsoRank did not. However
as PINALOG generated far more conserved interactions (NC) than
IsoRank, it is helpful to consider the ratio of NI to NC. This ratio is
0.14 for PINALOG, 0.19 for IsoRank and 0.88 for BLAST. Ifthe sole
aim is to ﬁnd interlogs, then BLAST is a superior approach to any
of these three network alignment methods. However, the PINALOG
alignment aims to establish equivalences based on function and
interactions not just those from sequence.

We also assess whether these conserved edges produce large and
dense connected subgraphs which is helpful in ﬁnding topologically
similar areas of the aligned networks indicating functional similarity.
A common connected subgraph (CCS) from the alignment is deﬁned
a connected subgraph of the conserved network. The largest CCS
from the conserved graph obtained from PINALOG is composed of
1858 proteins connected by 2774 interactions; while that of IsoRank
has only 44 proteins connected by 87 interactions (Supplementary
Fig. SI-4). The conserved graph from PINALOG alignment does not
only have more conserved interactions but is also similar in terms of
function. Using a functional clustering method (see Supplementary
Material) on the human conserved network from the PINALOG
alignment, we identiﬁed several clusters of proteins with closely
related functions. The corresponding yeast clusters are functionally
similar to the human clusters. For example, cluster 12 in both
species includes proteins that fomn different proteasome complexes;
cluster 137 in both species contains proteins from the anaphase
promoting complex. The average ﬁinctional similarity of mapped
clusters is 0.33, and 23% of the pairs of mapped clusters have
average functional similarity >0.5.

Although the largest CCS of MI-GRAAL is large (3773
nodes, 3789 edges), it is not as dense as the largest CCS
found by PINALOG-A (network density 0.001 versus 0.002,
clustering coefﬁcient 0.001 versus 0.091; see Supplementary
Material). Functional clustering of the human conserved network

of MI-GRAAL followed by mapping onto the yeast clusters shows
that there is little or no functional similarity between corresponding
clusters. The average ﬁinctional similarity between corresponding
clusters of MI-GRAAL is 0.16 as compared with PINALOG 0.33.
The correspondence in function of mapped clusters obtained from
the conserved graph of the PINALOG alignment indicates that the
resulting alignment shows the actual biological equivalence between
the two input networks.

3.1.2 Alignment of the human PPIN with other species We
have also applied PINALOG to align the networks of human-
ﬂy, human-worm and human-mouse. The PPINs of ﬂy, womn and
mouse are relatively sparse compared with the yeast interactome.
Therefore, the alignment between human and species other than
yeast are expected to have far fewer conserved interactions.
However, as these species are closer to human in terms of
evolution, the resulting alignment should produce a larger number of
Homologenes. Taking into consideration these expected differences,
the statistics for these comparisons (Supplementary Table SI-l)
are broadly in keeping with the observations for human-yeast. For
any comparison, PINALOG, IsoRank and MI-GRAAL identify a
very similar number of aligned pairs (NA). In terms of conserved
edges (NC), MA-GRAAL ﬁnds most, then PINALOG and ﬁnally
IsoRank. In keeping with the use of ﬁinctional similarity to
establish the alignment, PINALOG ﬁnds more functional alignments
(NF). PINALOG identiﬁes more Homologene pairs than IsoRank
and MI-GRAAL. In addition, PINALOG ﬁnds more interlogs
that IsoRank and MI-GRAAL and for these comparisons the
ratio NI/NC is at least double for PINALOG compared with
IsoRank.

3.1.3 Yeast2-ﬂy2 alignment and Graemlin’s performance In the
alignment between yeast and ﬂy interactomes, PINALOG and
IsoRank perform comparably, apart from the PINALOG having
more functional equivalences (NF). MI-GRAAL fails to ﬁnd any
Homologenes or interlogs. The values of NA and NC show that
Graemlin’s alignment is far smaller than those from PINALOG,
IsoRank and MI-GRAAL. Graemlin only ﬁnds 23 Homologenes
compared with 241 from PINALOG and 2211 from IsoRank.
PINALOG, IsoRank and Graemlin ﬁnd very similar number of
interlogs (36, 34 and 36, respectively).

In summary, PINALOG generally performed better than IsoRank
in most pairs of species in terms of conserved interactions,
homologous pairs and interlogs. In the human-yeast alignment,
although PINALOG ﬁnds more interlogs (NI), the fraction of
conserved interactions which are interlogs is larger in IsoRank
(see NI/NC). Very similar results are obtained in the ﬂy2-
yeast2 equivalences for PINALOG and IsoRank. Comparison with
Graemlin 2.0 shows that PINALOG and IsoRank generate far larger
alignments with more Homologenes. Although MI-GRAAL uses the
same source of data including sequence and ﬁinctional similarity,
it does not produce alignments with similar protein pairs in terms
of either ﬁinction or sequence. We explored the use of different
parameters in MI-GRAAL to improve performance, but were unable
to obtain improvements over the default values. Further analysis on
the ﬁinctional similarity of aligned protein pairs (see Supplementary
Material and Supplementary Fig. SI-5) shows the advantage of
utilizing the available functional information in the alignment,

which in turn provides a more biologically relevant mapping of the
networks.

4 PROTEIN COMPLEX PREDICTION

One of the applications of network alignment is to use the available
information on the protein complex in one species to predict the
protein complex components in another species. To benchmark
the protein complex prediction of PINALOG, we performed a
comparison of PINALOG with network-based complex prediction
methods, including MCODE (Bader and Hogue, 2003), MCL
(Dongen, 2000), network alignment methods including IsoRank,
MI-GRAAL and BLAST. Comparisons were made on the gold-
standard set of yeast complexes MIPS CYDG (Guldener et al.,
2005) comprising of 214 protein complexes. Predictions of the
yeast complexes were made by PINALOG, IsoRank, MI-GRAAL
and BLAST by transferring the protein complex information from
human to yeast, with the human protein complexes information
obtained from the MIPS CORUM (Ruepp et al., 2008) database.
An assessment of prediction methods was performed using a series
of ﬁinctions based on the overlapping score (OS, see Supplementary
Material). The prediction p is said to match with complex m if
OS(p,m) is >0.2. Given the scores of matching between predictions
and known complexes, measures to assess the quality of prediction
include: (i) Precision P is the fraction of predicted complexes p
matching known complexes m; (ii) Recall Ris the fraction of known
complexes m matching predicted complexes p; and (iii) F -measure

F1 is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing the

overall performance of the prediction methods F1 = 

Figure 2 presents the precision, recall and F -measure of
yeast protein complex prediction by PINALOG-A. PINALOG
outperforms MCODE, MCL, IsoRank and MI-GRAAL in all three
measures, with 37% recall at 21% precision and an F -measure
of 26%. The performance of PINALOG is better than BLAST in
precision but worse in recall. However, in the F -measure, which
summarizes the overall performance, these two methods perform
equally well.

It should be noted that the precision and recall are not high
because the benchmark protein complexes are those identiﬁed by
experiments that do not cover all protein complexes in yeast.
Thus a high number of false positives (FPs) are expected. These
FPs are candidates for protein complexes that could be studied
experimentally. To assess whether these FPs are likely to be true
protein complexes or not, we have examined the predicted clusters
that do not match with known complexes. Using GOTermFinder
(Boyle et al., 2004), we have identiﬁed signiﬁcant GO term
enrichment in many unmatched predicted clusters. For example,
the 9 proteins of cluster 13 are enriched with terms related to
chromatin modiﬁcation, chromatin organization, and chromatin
assembly and disassembly. Cluster 2, comprising 23 proteins, is
enriched with terms relating to oxidation—reduction process. Another
example is cluster 12 with 8 proteins that are related to M phase
during cell division. The GOTermFinder analysis indicates that the
putative FPs in the PINALOG prediction may well be true protein
complexes.

BLAST performed as well as PINALOG and better than other
single network-based methods. However, when inspecting the
overlap in the predictions made by PINALOG and BLAST, we

deﬁned in the main text.

found that the overlap of the two predicted sets of clusters is not
substantial, with only 50% of the predicted clusters matched. This
suggests that PINALOG and BLAST could be used complementarily
to predict protein complexes. This would provide a better coverage
of the possible protein complexes. BLAST predicts clusters based
on protein sequence, thus the prediction space is limited to sequence
related proteins. In contrast, PINALOG predictions are made based
on a combination of sequence, ﬁinction and network topology,
therefore the prediction space is extended to functionally related
protein clusters that are reinforced by conserved interactions. We
have combined the predictions made by PINALOG and BLAST
into one predictor PINALOG+BLAST. This combination not only
boosted the precision but also the recall rate, yielding a higher
F -measure as compared with the individual methods (Fig. 2). We
suggest that PINALOG and BLAST are used combination to help
predicting protein complex more accurately.

5 BENCHMARKING OF PROTEIN FUNCTION
PREDICTION

Another application of PINALOG is to predict the ﬁinction of
proteins by inheriting the annotation available of the aligned protein
from the other species. PINALOG aims at providing function
prediction (i) when there is no sequence homology; (ii) when
there is a sequence homology between the un-annotated protein
and the aligned annotated protein in the other species but the per
cent sequence identity is low (typically <30%) and thus direct
functional transfer can lead to misleading annotations (Tian and
Skolnick, 2003; Todd et al., 2001). PINALOG is compared with the
widely-used sequence-based method PSI-BLAST and to IsoRank.
A dataset of proteins to test the accuracy of function prediction was
established with 415 GO annotated human proteins. These proteins
had low per cent identity (<30%) to the closest annotated PSI-
BLAST hit in the UniprotKB database. A 100-fold cross validation
was performed. In each run of the cross validation, a set of proteins
from the test set and had their GO terms hidden. The test proteins
which were aligned with an annotated protein in the other species

were identiﬁed and the function transferred. Over the 100 runs, a
total of 169 proteins were equivalenced and their ﬁinction predicted.
Functions of mapped proteins in yeast represented by GO terms in
two categories BP (biological process) and MF (molecular function)
were directly transferred to the human proteins in the test set.

The results were analyzed in terms of precision and recall, where
tpffp and recall as t1Jﬁ; tp,
the number of true positives, false positives and false negatives of
the predictions made. Our method is a binary predictor without a
variable cut-off parameter and thus no precision/recall curve can be
produced. Table 2 shows that PINALOG outperforms PSI-BLAST
prediction with a superior recall rate at similar level of precision
with BP category. The McNemar test (McNemar, 1947) for the
statistical signiﬁcance of the difference in the performance was used
based on the number of misclassiﬁcations in each method. The test
indicates that PINALOG predictions are signiﬁcantly different from
PSI-BLAST in BP terms at the level of P = 0.001 signiﬁcance level.
PINALOG predicts more BP terms with a recall twice that of PSI-
BLAST (14% versus 7%) at the same level of precision (~28%).
For the MF category, PINALOG and PSI-BLAST share very similar
levels of recall (~28%) while the precision of PSI-BLAST is
slightly better (43% versus 47%). The McNemar test suggests no
signiﬁcant difference between them at the P=0.001 signiﬁcance
level. On the other hand, PINALOG outperforms IsoRank in both
BP (P=0.001) and MF (P=0.001) categories. For example, in the
BP category, PINALOG has almost twice the recall compared with
IsoRank (14% versus 8%) at higher precision (28% versus 20%,
Table 2). To summarize, in the challenging area where sequence
similarity does not contribute substantially to the prediction of
protein function, PINALOG enhances the ability to predict ﬁinction
of these proteins.

PINALOG was used to predict functions for un-annotated human
proteins without any PSI-BLAST hit in the human-yeast alignment.
For the 60 such human proteins, PINALOG mapped 14 of them
to the proteins in yeast and made predictions for human proteins
from the yeast counterparts. The ﬁinction of only nine proteins
was predicted (and provided in Supplementary Table SI-2 in
Supplementary Material) because the remaining ﬁve are mapped
to proteins in yeast that have annotation only with very general GO
terms. We compared our predictions to those from ffPred (Lobley
et al., 2007), a web-server for ﬁinction prediction of orphan or
un-annotated proteins. Out of these nine proteins, ffPred provides
ﬁinctions for six proteins, three of which have very general GO
terms, the rest of the predictions agreeing with our predictions. We
have also run these nine proteins through the structure prediction
server Phyre2 (Kelley and Sternberg, 2009) which detects templates
which can be remote homologues not identiﬁable by PSI-BLAST.

For six of the PINALOG predictions, the functional descriptions of
these templates proteins match with or are similar to the PINALOG
predictions. This strongly suggests that the PINALOG predictions
are reliable and can help guide experimentalists to identify protein
function.

6 DISCUSSION

Although many methods have been developed to align PPINs,
comparing their performance remains difﬁcult due to the absence of
an unambiguous correct alignment, the complexity of the networks
and the differing aims of the alignment methods. For local alignment
methods, the difﬁculty is less severe as some local alignments can
be evaluated by their agreement with known protein complexes.
However, this approach is less useﬁil to evaluate global alignment
methods. Often assessment is performed based on the correctness
of mapping orthologous protein pairs. However, this assessment
measure would always penalize equivalences based on network
topology when this conﬂicts with equivalences between orthologous
pairs. Therefore this assessment method is not ideal in evaluating
the performance of network alignment algorithms. Accordingly, we
have also used a series of other measures.

PINALOG is ﬂexible in allowing the use of sequence only
alignment or sequence-function alignment depending on the
requirement of the user. For the sequence-function alignment,
parameters are automatically calculated from the input species
and this will help non-experts. When aligning two species where
one or both species are poorly annotated, alignment might be
biased towards aligning well-annotated proteins whose ﬁinctions
are similar. Then it is advisable that sequence and network
topology only are used to align the networks to avoid bias. We
are developing a version of PINALOG to perform alignment
of PPINs from multiple species. A web-server for PINALOG
is available allowing users to upload necessary information and
receive alignment results by email and by a link to the results
ﬁle (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~pinalog/). The computing time of
the alignment process depends on the size of the input networks.
The typical computing time is <24h with the longest run in our
assessment being the human-yeast alignment which takes 24h
on a computer with 2.8GHz processor with 8 GB memory (see
Supplementary Material). Given the importance of the resulting
alignment, this time is acceptable. The code for PINALOG is
available from the website, Download section.

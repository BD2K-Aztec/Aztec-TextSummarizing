example. Documentation (online and PDF) for minepy is avail—
able at the minepy website, also as online help in R for minerva.

2.1 Performance comparison

The suite was tested for consistency with MINE.jar v1.0.1 on the
Spellman and microbiome datasets from http://www.explore—
data.net.

For the Spellman dataset (4381 transcripts and 23 timepoints),
MIC values were computed for all features pairs with MINE.jar
and minepy (both with at = 0.67). Identical results were found up
to five signiﬁcance digits: see Supplementary Figure S3 and de—
tails in Supplementary Material. For the microbiome data, for
the 77 top ranked association pairs listed in Supplementary
Table S13 of (Reshef et al., 2011), we obtained 44 identical re—
sults and a difference less than 0.01 for other 29 values (details in
Supplementary Material).

To compare performance for RAM and CPU usage between
MINE.jar and the suite, MINE statistics were computed on all
features pairs of the Spellman dataset, for increasing feature set
sizes (details in Supplementary Material, Sec 2.2, 2A). Minerva
and minepy completed all tasks with limited RAM requirements:
about 19 MB were needed for all 4382 variables (600 kB dataset
size) by minepy, and 2MB by the C++ interface. We were
unable to run MINE.jar with >2000 variables, for which Java
used 7.5 GB and minepy 16 MB, respectively (Fig. 1 and

Number of features (dataset KB)

Fig. 1. Comparison of MINE.jar v1.0.1 and the novel interfaces
(minerva, minepy, Matlab/Octave and C++) computing the four
MINE statistics, the Pearson correlation coefficient and the non-linearity
index for all pairs of features of the Spellman dataset. For increasing
number of features: (top) Resident set size (RSS), i.e. the non-swapped
physical memory (in megabytes); (bottom) elapsed real (wall clock) time
used by the process, in seconds. MINE.jar can complete the task only up
to 2000 features, even having reserved 8GB RAM to Java. In parentheses,
the dataset ASCII file size in kilobytes (KB)

Supplementary Table S2). Minepy computing times are about
twice those of the Java solution (Supplementary Table S3), but
the speedup is close to 70 for minerva on 100 cores via MP1 on a
Linux cluster, with the default 0! = 0.6 (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Finer grids ((120.7) require much higher computing time as
sample size increases (Supplementary Fig. S7).

We additionally tested the suite on two recent high—throughput
transcriptomics datasets, of Affymetrix HumanExon 1.0ST
human brain tissues and Illumina Genome Analyzer II—
sequenced human nonismall cell lung cancer (Table 1). Details
on datasets and experiments are reported in Supplementary
Material.

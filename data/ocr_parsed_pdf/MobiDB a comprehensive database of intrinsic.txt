ABSTRACT

Motivation: Disordered protein regions are key to the function of
numerous processes within an organism and to the determination
of a protein’s biological role. The most common source for protein
disorder annotations, DisProt, covers only a fraction of the available
sequences. Alternatively, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has been
mined for missing residues in X-ray crystallographic structures.
Herein, we provide a centralized source for data on different flavours
of disorder in protein structures, MobiDB, building on and expanding
the content provided by already existing sources. In addition to the
DisProt and PDB X-ray structures, we have added experimental
information from NMR structures and five different flavours of two
disorder predictors (ESpritz and IUpred). These are combined into a
weighted consensus disorder used to classify disordered regions into
flexible and constrained disorder. Users are encouraged to submit
manual annotations through a submission form. MobiDB features
experimental annotations for 17 285 proteins, covering the entire
PDB and predictions for the SwissProt database, with 565 200
annotated sequences. Depending on the disorder flavour, 6—20% of
the residues are predicted as disordered.

1 INTRODUCTION

During the last decade, strong evidence has surfaced indicating
that many proteins function in a natively unfolded or intrinsically
disordered state (Dunker et (11., 2008; Wright and Dyson, 1999).
These regions have been shown to play important roles in various
biological processes (Tompa, 2010). The amount of disorder within
a proteome seems to correlate with the complexity of the organism,
especially in eukaryotes (Ward et (11., 2004). The existence of
different ﬂavours of disorder has been proposed (Vucetic et (11.,
2003), and disordered regions have been categorized according
to their function with a suggested coupling between disorder
conservation and protein function (Bellay et (11., 2011; Schlessinger
et (11., 2011).

The main repository for experimentally determined disorder is
the DisProt database (Sickmeier et (11., 2007), containing manually
curated information on currently ca. 650 proteins from the literature.
Although invaluable as a gold standard, DisProt represents only a

fraction of the known protein sequences posing a bottleneck for
large-scale analysis of intrinsic protein disorder. Many prediction
methods have long resorted to considering the lack of coordinates
in X-ray protein structures as a proxy for intrinsic disorder (Walsh
et (11., 2011; Ward et (11., 2004). This increases the number of
available sequences by an order of magnitude for mostly short
disordered segments. Recently, our group has also developed a
method to deﬁne intrinsic disorder by looking at mobile regions in
NMR structures (Martin et (11., 2010). Herein we describe MobiDB,
a centralized resource for disorder annotation in protein sequences.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

MobiDB is a relational PostgreSQL database consisting of 11 tables.
The data are divided into two subsets: MobiDB-xp, containing only
proteins with experimental annotation and MobiDB-full, for proteins
with predictions. Annotations are extracted from different sources,
currently yielding eight-different ﬂavours. The PDB-X-ray data are
obtained by considering as disordered residues whose Ca atoms
are missing from X-ray crystallographic structures deposited in the
PDB (Berman et (11., 2007). The novel PDB-NMR is generated
by processing NMR structures in the PDB with MOBI (Martin
et (11., 2010) and DisProt data (Sickmeier et (11., 2007) are obtained
directly. Predictions are obtained by running ESpritz (Walsh et (11.,
2012) (long, X-ray and NMR) and IUPred (Dosztanyi et (11.,
2005) (short and long) on all SwissProt sequences. Sensitivity and
speciﬁcity values of each predictor on a common benchmark can
be found online. Sequences are linked to UniProt (The UniProt
Consortium, 2011) and Pfam (Finn et (11., 2010) through SIFTS
(Velankar et (11., 2005) for PDB structures and DisProt. A consensus
disorder score assigns higher weights to experimental annotations
over predictions (see online documentation). Disorder is divided into
constrained and ﬂexible based on conservation (Bellay et (11 ., 2011).
Secondary structure in PDB ﬁles is identiﬁed with DSSP (Kabsch
and Sander, 1983). Manual data curation is also supported and users
are encouraged to submit annotations through a feedback submission
form.

3 USAGE

MobiDB was designed with two main scenarios in mind. First, a user
wishes to analyse a particular protein of interest and dynamically
access all the available disorder information, with the option to
generate (and download) a consensus annotation. Second, the user
would like to obtain a dataset of disorder information for a protein
ensemble with certain characteristics, downloading it for ofﬂine
usage and analysis with other tools. MobiDB offers two options

Fig. 1. Sample MobiDB output for human p53. The top part contains
the UniProt description and database links. The sequence plot (central
part) summarizes the disorder information graphically, showing the protein
sequence horizontally annotated with Pfam domains and the different
disorder ﬂavours. Experimental data are shown in stronger colours (ordered
in blue and disordered in red) than predictions. Consensus disorder (blue
to red colour gradient) and conservation annotations are also shown. The
detailed annotations (bottom part) allow the dynamic selection of annotating
sequences and show the relevant sequence stretches

to access the information. The user may either browse the different
MobiDB-xp ﬂavours (PDB-X-ray, PDB-NMR or DisProt) or use
the search function. The latter offers three options: by identiﬁer,
stande and BLAST (Altschul et (11., 1997). For a ﬁill explanation
please refer to the online documentation. After selecting a browse
option or performing a search, the user will be presented with the
results page. In this page, it is possible to either select a single
entry and proceed to the protein visualization interface or to generate
a dataset containing disorder annotations for all selected proteins.
This dataset will consist of two FASTA formatted ﬁles for each
protein: one containing an alignment of the reference sequence and
all the annotating sequences and the second containing annotations
associated to these sequences.

The protein visualization interface (Fig. 1) was designed as
an annotation sandbox for dynamical protein annotation. The
interface is composed of a variety of widgets or boxes that can be
dragged, expanded or collapsed, allowing for the optimization of the
available workspace. The ‘reference sequence information’ widget
displays data for the chosen reference sequence from UniProt.
The ‘annotation sources’ widget allows selecting or deselecting
annotating sequences, and/or their corresponding regions. The
‘annotations plot’ widget offers a graphical representation of the
reference sequence and the chosen annotating sequences, while
also displaying Pfam and secondary structure annotations (where
available). The ‘dynamic annotation’ widget displays the colour
coded sequence for the reference protein, according to whether a
region is annotated as ordered or disordered. A second set of three
colours for predicted disorder annotations is provided (in lighter

shades). Consensus disorder predictions are provided together with
a classiﬁcation into ﬂexible and constrained regions (Bellay et (11.,
2011).

As an example, we show the annotations for the human p53
tumour suppressor protein in Figure 1. p53 contains structured
tetramerization and core domains linked together and ﬂanked by
intrinsically disordered regions. The structure of p53 (or lack
thereof) has been widely studied, and a comprehensive model
has been built (Wells et (11., 2008). The MobiDB entry for p53
summarizes this situation well (Fig. 1).

MobiDB provides the means to obtain disorder annotations for
an extensive set of proteins as a centralized and up-to-date source
of information on various available disorder ﬂavours. We are
planning on providing manual annotations and integrating more
data generated from other predictors to better characterize different
disorder ﬂavours and their functional implications.

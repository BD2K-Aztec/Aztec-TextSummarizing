Abstract

Summary: One gene can produce multiple transcript variants encoding proteins with different
functions. To facilitate visual analysis of transcript variants, we developed ProtAnnot, which shows
protein annotations in the context of genomic sequence. ProtAnnot searches InterPro and displays
profile matches (protein annotations) alongside gene models, exposing how alternative promoters,
splicing and 3’ end processing add, remove, or remodel functional motifs. To draw attention to
these effects, ProtAnnot color—codes exons by frame and displays a cityscape graphic summarizing
exonic sequence at each position. These techniques make visual analysis of alternative transcripts

 

faster and more convenient for biologists.

Availability and implementation: ProtAnnot is a plug—in App for Integrated Genome Browser, an
open source desktop genome browser available from http://www.bioviz.org.

1 Introduction

Many genes produce multiple transcript variants due to alternative
splicing, alternative promoters and alternative 3’ end processing.
Often these transcript variants encode proteins with different amino
acid sequences and thus different functions. We and other groups
have often used protein annotation methods to detect when this
occurs. For example, we used BLOCKS, InterPro and TM—HMM to
show that alternative transcription frequently remodels or deletes
conserved regions and trans—membrane spans in human and mouse
proteins (Cline et (11., 2004; Loraine et (11., 2002).

However, even now it is difficult for biologists to perform simi—
lar analysis. Using Web tools (Rodriguez et (11., 2015), biologists can
identify conserved regions in proteins encoded by different splice
variants, but mapping those regions back onto gene structures is
time—consuming and error—prone.

To address this, we developed ProtAnnot as a new plug—in exten—
sion for the Integrated Genome Browser (1GB). 1GB is a highly

interactive, desktop genome browser that helps biologists explore and
analyze experimental data from genomics, especially RNA—Seq data
(Nicol et (11., 2009). Using ProtAnnot together with 1GB, users can
achieve deeper insight into how alternative transcription affects protein
sequence and function.

2 Results

ProtAnnot enables fast, efficient visual analysis of the impact of al—
ternative transcription on proteins by extending standard genome
browser iconography, in which linked blocks represent transcript
structures and block thickness indicate translated regions.

ProtAnnot improves on this in three ways. First, it uses exon fill
colors to show the frame of translation, revealing frame shifts across
transcript variants. By comparing exon colors between transcripts, a
user can quickly determine if they encode the same protein without
having to zoom in to see the amino acid sequence.

Fig. 1. ProtAnnot visualization of Arabidopsis thaliana gene ATAG36690 encoding splicing regulator U2AF65 shows how alternative splicing deletes a nucleotide-
binding domain. Different colors for coding region exons indicate different frames of translation

Second, ProtAnnot introduces an exon summary graphic, a series
of blocks at the bottom of the display whose heights indicate the
number of exons overlapping each position. Height differences be—
tween blocks signal where models differ. By scanning the exon sum—
mary, users can easily identify difference regions (English et (11.,
2010), sequences that are differentially included in transcripts due to
alternative splicing, promoters, or 3’—end processing. The exon sum—
mary graphic draws attention to these regions by exploiting our na—
tive ability to notice discontinuities in a horizon (Fig. 1).

Third, ProtAnnot exposes how different regions of a gene may
encode different functions by displaying protein annotations next to
their respective transcripts. In ProtAnnot, these protein annotations
appear as single— or multi—span linked blocks beneath the transcripts
that encode them. A thin line links spans from the same motif; note
that these matches often span introns.

To use ProtAnnot, users select ProtAnnot in the IGB App
Manager (available from the Plug—ins tab in IGB 8.5); this down—
loads ProtAnnot to a local cache. A new menu item labeled ‘Start
ProtAnnot’ then appears in the IGB Tools menu. Next, the user se—
lects one or more gene models within the IGB main display window
and selects ‘Tools>Start ProtAnnot’. This opens ProtAnnot in a
new window, which shows the selected gene models with color—
coded exons and exon summary graphic.

To search InterPro using ProtAnnot, users select the InterProScan
tabbed panel and click a button labeled ‘Run InterProScan,’ which opens
a new window with search options available from the InterProScan
Web service hosted at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Users then
select one or many databases to search, enter an email address and run
the search. Note that the InterProScan Web service maintainers require
the user’s contact information to run the search service.

When the search finishes, ProtAnnot adds newly found protein
annotations to the display, below their respective transcripts.
ProtAnnot also updates the status message with a link to an XML
file hosted on the EBI Web site containing the ‘raw’ results; this is
mainly a convenience for developers.

Clicking a protein annotation opens the Properties tab, which lists
information about that particular profile or motif. Depending on the
selected item, this can include its InterPro identifier, name, description
and a link to the InterPro Web site. Users can also shift—click to select
multiple annotations, putting all of the available information side—by—
side, allowing for direct comparison.

Figure 1 shows an example visualization that highlights how
ProtAnnot can lead to new discoveries. This example shows a gene
from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana encoding a homolog of
U2AF65, part of the U2AF dimer that recruits the U2 snRNP com—
plex to the branchpoint adenosine residue during the early steps of
splicing. Coding region exons are color—coded to indicate frame of
translation, making it easy to notice when overlapping exons encode
the same or different peptides. Likewise, the exon summary graphic
highlights differences in splicing between gene models.

Previously, we analyzed RNA—Seq data from pollen and leaves
and found that in pollen, AT4G36690.3 is the dominant isoform,
but in leaves, AT4G36690.4 predominates (Loraine et (11., 2013). As
shown in Figure 1, visualizing the gene models in ProtAnnot exposes
potential functional consequences of pollen—specific splicing of
U2AF65A. The pollen—specific isoform (lower) lacks a region encod—
ing a nucleotide—binding alpha—beta domain, which is involved in
RNA—binding. Thus, alternative splicing of U2AF65A is likely to
have important functional consequences.

As with IGB, we developed ProtAnnot using the GenoViz SDK, a
Java toolkit for building genome browsers (Helt et (11., 2009). By using
GenoViz, we were able to implement advanced visualization tech—
niques familiar to IGB users with minimal effort. These include: user—
settable zoom focus indicated by a zoom stripe graphic, fast animated
zooming, edge matching of selected items and selectable Glyphs.

Search results can be saved and reopened later, which saves time
for the user and also reduces load on the InterProScan Web service.
ProtAnnot saves results to an XML format file (extension ‘.paxml’)
that contains a slice of genomic sequence surrounding the gene mod—
els, an offset indicating the relationship between the slice and the
larger reference, transcript structures using coordinates relative to
the slice and protein annotations in protein sequence coordinates.

3 Conclusion

ProtAnnot benefits users by exposing how gene structures affect
protein sequence and function. As such, ProtAnnot complements the
MI Bundle, another IGB extension that links genomic features to pro—
tein interaction and structure viewers (Céol and Muller, 2015). Like
MI Bundle, ProtAnnot highlights relationships between the language
of DNA (exons, introns, codons) and the more structure—oriented

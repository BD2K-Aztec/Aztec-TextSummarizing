Abstract

Motivation: Genome—wide association study (GWAS) has been a great success in the past decade.
However, significant challenges still remain in both identifying new risk loci and interpreting re—
sults. Bonferroni—corrected significance level is known to be conservative, leading to insufficient
statistical power when the effect size is moderate at risk locus. Complex structure of linkage dis—
equilibrium also makes it challenging to separate causal variants from nonfunctional ones in large
haplotype blocks. Under such circumstances, a computational approach that may increase signal
replication rate and identify potential functional sites among correlated markers is urgently
needed.

Results: We describe GenoWAP, a GWAS signal prioritization method that integrates genomic
functional annotation and GWAS test statistics. The effectiveness of GenoWAP is demonstrated
through its applications to Crohn’s disease and schizophrenia using the largest studies available,
where highly ranked loci show substantially stronger signals in the whole dataset after prioritiza—
tion based on a subset of samples. At the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level, top ranked
SNPs after prioritization have both higher replication rates and consistently stronger enrichment of
eQTLs. Within each risk locus, GenoWAP may be able to distinguish functional sites from groups
of correlated SNPs.

been designed and applied to identify disease genes for almost all
complex diseases. As of January 15, 2015, 15 216 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP) from over 2000 publications have been docu—
mented in the GWAS Catalog (Hindorff et (11., 2009). Despite its
great success in identifying disease—associated loci, scientists have
noted several limitations of current GWAS approaches. First,

LD structure among SNPs, it is the disease—associated haplotype
blocks varying in size from a few kb to more than 100 kb (Wall and
Pritchard, 2003) that are identified in GWASs. Therefore, the reso—
lution of GWAS is not sufficient for distinguishing causal variants
from a large group of correlated SNPs, especially in non—coding re—
gions Where the mechanism of genomic function is still largely

unknown (Cooper and Shendure, 2011; Visscher et (11., 2012; Ward
and Kellis, 2012). Second, although Bonferroni—corrected signifi—
cance threshold (i.e. 5 X 10‘s) is widely accepted as the standard
cutoff in GWAS analysis, it is well known that Bonferroni correc—
tion, as an approach that controls family—wise error rate, is conser—
vative when the number of hypotheses is large and there are many
weak to moderate signals (Efron, 2010). In fact, for most complex
diseases, numerous genomic loci are involved in disease etiology
while each locus only has a moderate effect size. Therefore, studies
based on high—throughput genomic scan may be underpowered if
the sample size is not large enough. This has led to so—called missing
heritability which refers to the gap between the narrow—sense herit—
ability estimated from twin/pedigree analysis and the proportion of
the variance explained by significant SNPs identified from GWAS,
that has been reported for many diseases (Manolio et (11., 2009;
Witte et (11., 2014). One explanation of missing heritability is the in—
sufficient statistical power to identify all the disease—associated SNPs
(Eichler et (11., 2010).

Variant prioritization techniques are crucial for post—GWAS ana—
lysis on different scales. Locally, it may be able to reveal truly func—
tional sites within each significant locus. Globally, signals at some
loci can be enhanced if proper prior information is used. Many vari—
ant prioritization methods have been proposed (Hou and Zhao,
2013). Supervised—learning—based statistical tools for predicting dele—
terious variants are probably the richest among available
approaches. So far, most of the existing deleteriousness prediction
tools only focus on protein—coding genes in the human genome.
However, coding—region—based tools are not sufficient for GWAS
signal prioritization because nearly 90% of the significant SNPs
identified in GWAS are intronic or intergenic (Eicher et (11., 2015;
Hindorff et (11., 2009). A few tools targeting non—coding variants
have been proposed (Fu et (11., 2014; Kircher et (11., 2014; Ritchie
et (11., 2014; Shihab et (11., 2015). Detailed comparisons of these
methods were reviewed elsewhere (Cooper and Shendure, 2011;
Wang et (11., 2015). Unlike the extensively studied protein—altering
variants, very few non—coding pathogenic variants have been re—
vealed so far (Ward and Kellis, 2012). Moreover, non—coding vari—
ants span a much wider functional spectrum. Varied and complex
mechanisms from cell—specific Transcription Factor Binding Sites
(TFBS), to enhancers, insulators, short and long range epigenetic
and structural effects on DNA, make it challenging to understand
non—coding variants in the human genome. Therefore, existing non—
coding variant prioritization tools based on supervised—learning may
suffer from the potentially biased training data. Their performance
in GWAS signal prioritization remains to be further investigated.
Finally, although deleteriousness of a single SNP is crucial for iden—
tifying causal variants, it does not provide all the information
needed in GWAS signal prioritization, where each SNP in GWAS
also carries information of nearby variants that are not genotyped.
A better—informed method should be able to measure the functional
potential for the surrounding region of each genotyped marker.

Recently, Lu et al. developed GenoCanyon, a statistical frame—
work to predict functional non—coding regions in the human genome
through integrated analysis of multiple biochemical signals and gen—
omic conservation measures (Lu et (11., 2015). Its unsupervised—
learning framework makes GenoCanyon suffer less from our limited
knowledge of non—coding genome. Moreover, since the resolution of
its functional prediction is at the nucleotide level, it is possible to use
GenoCanyon scores to evaluate the surrounding region of each gen—
otyped SNP. In this paper, we propose Genome Wide Association
Prioritizer (GenoWAP), a GWAS signal prioritization approach that
integrates GenoCanyon functional prediction and GWAS P—values.

We apply the method on two smaller GWASs of Crohn’s disease
and schizophrenia, respectively, to prioritize SNPs. The performance
is evaluated using the results from large GWAS meta—analyses of
these two diseases. Compared to the top loci ranked on P—values
only, top ranked loci after prioritization tend to show substantially
stronger signals in large GWAS studies. Within each locus,
GenoWAP may be able to distinguish true signals among highly cor—
related SNPs. The method has the potential to reduce noises caused
by LD and rescue marginal signals in GWASs with insufficient sam—
ple sizes.

2 Methods

2.1 Statistical model

For each SNP, we define Z to be the indicator of general functional—
ity, and define ZD to be the indicator of disease—specific functional—
ity. More specifically, if a SNP or its surrounding region is active in
any genomic functional pathway, then Z equals to 1. If this SNP or
the surrounding region is involved in the disease pathway, then ZD
equals to 1. For each SNP, we use p to denote its P—value obtained
from the standard GWAS analysis.

The goal of GWAS signal prioritization is to assign each SNP a
new score that measures its importance. A reasonable quantity
would be the conditional probability of being disease—specific func—
tional given the P—value, i.e. P(ZD : 1(1)). Using Bayes formula, we
can rewrite the conditional probability as below.

f(P|ZD : 1) X P(ZD : 1)
(pIzD : 1) x P(ZD : 1) +f<pIzD : o) x P(ZD : o)
(1)
Based on the definitions of Z and ZD, SNPs satisfying ZD : 1 must

be a subset of the SNPs satisfying Z : 1. This is because if a SNP is
disease—specific functional, it has to be functional in the general

 

P(ZD : 1|?) :f

sense as well. Therefore, we get the following formula.
P(ZD : 1) : P(Z : 1,21) : 1)

(2)
:P(ZD : 1(2: 1) X P(Z: 1)

In order to calculate the conditional probability P(ZD : 1lp) for a
marker, we need its prior probability of being functional, i.e.
P(Z : 1), the P—value density for disease—specific functional
markers, i.e. f(plZD : 1), the P—value density for markers that are
not related to the disease, i.e. f (plZD : 0), and finally, the condi—
tional probability of being disease—specific functional given the
marker is functional in the general sense, i.e. P(ZD : 1lZ : 1).

2.2 Estimation
Recently, Lu et al. developed GenoCanyon, a statistical framework
predicting functional genomic regions (Lu et (11., 2015). Through
integrating diverse types of annotation data, including genomic con—
servation measures, DNase hypersensitivity, FAIRE, histone modifi—
cations and transcription factor binding activities using
unsupervised learning techniques, GenoCanyon measures the func—
tional potential for each nucleotide in the human genome. For each
SNP in a GWAS dataset, the mean GenoCanyon functional score of
its surrounding 10000 base pairs is used as the prior probability
P(Z : 1). Different from using variant—based annotation tools as
the prior knowledge, this prior information not only measures the
importance of the genotyped marker, but also evaluates its sur—
rounding region where ungenotyped causal variants may reside.
Next, we partition all the SNPs into functional (Z : 1) and non—
functional (Z : 0) subgroups based on the calculated mean

GenoCanyon scores with cutoff 0.1. Since GenoCanyon functional
score has a bimodal pattern, this partition is not sensitive to the cut—
off choice. The partition step is necessary because of two major rea—
sons. First, the signal pattern in the functional subgroup is amplified
after noise reduction (Fig. 1). The increase in the proportion of dis—
ease—related markers in the functional subgroup leads to more stable
estimates in the following steps. Second, the P—value density for non—
functional markers, i.e. f (plZ : 0), can now be estimated empiric—
ally. Since the P—values are acquired from a disease—specific study,
we assume that the P—values for markers not related to the disease
behave just like the P—values for markers that are not functional en—
tirely. Mathematically, this assumption is characterized as the equa—
tion below.

f(PlZD : 0) = f(PlZ = 0) (3)

Based on this assumption, we can estimate f (plZ D : 0) using the
P—values for SNPs in the non—functional subgroup. Notably, it may
seem natural to assume (plZD : 0) follows a uniform distribution.
However, the P—value of a marker with ZD:0 can actually be
driven by a nearby disease—related marker due to LD. The empiric—
ally estimated density can capture a certain amount of LD informa—
tion, which is complex and non—trivial to model. Moreover, it is
common to see some variants with low minor allele frequencies in
GWAS samples. The P—values for these markers will form a spike
near 1 in the P—value density. The empirically estimated density is
also able to account for this artifact. We propose to use histogram
for density estimation, because it has stable performance near the
boundary. In fact, the P—value boundary near 0 is where the real sig—
nals reside, and the boundary near 1 occasionally has the artifact
issue caused by rare variants. Histogram is able to capture both
issues. Moreover, the sample size in this empirical Bayes framework
is the total number of markers, which is usually large in GWAS.

gram of non-functional SNPs (Z: 0), P—value histogram of functional SNPs
(2:1), and estimated P—value density of disease-specific functional SNPs

non-functional SNPs (Z: 0), P—value histogram of functional SNPs (Z: 1) and
estimated P—value density of disease-specific functional SNPs (2.3: 1) in the
PGC2011 GWAS of schizophrenia

Therefore, histogram is a reasonable choice for density estimation.
The number of bins can be chosen based on cross—validation.

It still remains to estimate the P—value density for disease—related
markers f(plZD : 1), and the conditional probability
P(ZD : 1lZ : 1). Now, we partition the functional subgroup
(Z : 1) into finer subgroups. First, based on Eq. (3), it is straightfor—
ward to show that

“(7)2217 ZD:0)=f(PlZD:0)=f(PlZ=0) (4)

Therefore, the P—value density for functional markers is the follow—
ing mixture.
f(pIZ : 1) : P(ZD : 1|Z : 1) x f<p|z : 172D : 1)
+P(ZD : 0|z : 1) X f(p|Z : 1,2,3 : 0)
: P(ZD : 1|Z : 1) x f(p|ZD : 1)
+P<ZD :olz: 1) Xf(pl 2D :0)

(5)

In formula (5), f (plZD : 0) has already been estimated in previous
steps. We further assume a parametric form of f(plZD : 1). In a re—
cent work of Chung et a1. (2014), they showed that beta distribution
is a robust approximation of P—value distribution under some
general assumptions of SNP effect size. We adopt the same
assumption.

(plZD : 1) ~ Beta(oi,1), 0 < at < 1 (6)

The constraint 0 < 06 < 1 guarantees that a smaller P—value is more
likely to occur than a larger P—value. Then, we apply the EM algo—
rithm on all the P—values in the functional subgroup. One advantage
of beta distribution assumption is that a closed—form expression is
available at each iteration in the EM algorithm. In this way, the esti—
mates for both P(ZD : 1lZ : 1) and P(plZD : 1) can be acquired.
Finally, since all missing pieces in formula (1) have been estimated,
we calculate the conditional probability P(ZD : 1lp) for all the
SNPs. This quantity is referred to as the posterior score in this
paper.

2.3 Data resource and preprocessing

Test statistics of the NIDDK study (Rioux et 41]., 2007) were down—
loaded from dbGap (Supplementary Table S1). Among the 298 391
SNPs, 70 were deleted due to unavailable hg19 genomic locations.
We calculated the posterior scores for the remaining 298 321 SNPs
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Test statistics of the IIBDGC meta—analysis
(Franke et 41]., 2010) were downloaded from the IIBDGC website
(http://www.ibdgenetics.org). The dataset contains 953 241 SNPs,
including 262 621 SNPs overlapping with the NIDDK dataset.

Test statistics for studies of schizophrenia (Ripke et al., 2011,
2014) were downloaded from the PGC website (Supplementary
Table S2). Coordinates were converted to hg19 using UCSC liftover
tool (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi—bin/thiftOver). Among the
1 252 901 SNPs in PGC2011 study, 264 were removed due to un—
available hg19 locations. Posterior scores were calculated for all the
remaining 1 252 637 SNPs (Supplementary Fig. S2). PGC2014 study
contains 9 444 230 SNPs, including 1 179 913 SNPs overlapping
with the PGC2011 dataset.

Finally, eQTL data used in the enrichment analysis include sin—
gle—tissue eQTLs from GTEx Analysis Release V4 (Ardlie et 41].,
2015), cis and trans eQTLs downloaded from Blood eQTL Browser
(Westra et 41]., 2013), and quantitative trait loci for DNA methyla—
tion and gene expression in human brain (Gibbs et 41]., 2010) down—
loaded from NCBI eQTL Browser (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
projects/gap/eqtl/index.cgi).

3 Results

3.1 Application to Crohn’s disease

Several GWASs of different scales have been performed for Crohn’s
disease. The largest GWAS meta—analysis, which identified 71 dis—
ease—associated loci, is among the studies identifying most significant
hits to date (Franke et 41]., 2010). We applied GenoWAP on a
smaller Crohn’s disease GWAS conducted by the North American
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
(NIDDK) IBD Genetics Consortium, and tested the results using the
large meta—analysis done by the International Inﬂammatory Bowel
Disease Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC). Cohort information is
listed in Supplementary Table S1. Details of both studies have been
reported previously (Franke et 41]., 2010; Rioux et 41]., 2007). It is
worth noting that the samples in these two studies overlap with each
other. However, the goal for this paper is not to replicate the de—
tected signals in an independent cohort. Instead, we seek to better
prioritize signals using only a small sample size. In order to test the
performance, the results from the largest study available are used as
the gold standard.

A total of 71 loci passed genome—wide significance level in the val—
idation stage of IIBDGC meta—analysis, including 32 previously re—
ported risk loci and 39 newly confirmed risk loci (Franke et 41].,
2010). We ranked the 298 321 SNPs in the NIDDK study based on
their P—values and posterior scores, respectively. Then, within each of
the 71 loci, we compared the rank of the lowest P—value to the rank of
the largest posterior score. 56 out of 71 loci (79%) had an improved
rank, 3 loci (4%) had an equal rank, while only 12 loci (17%) had a
reduced rank (Supplementary Table S3). The probability of having an
increased rank is significantly higher than that of having a decreased
rank (P—value : 3.1 1 X 10‘8, one—sided binomial test).

Next, we compared the top 20 loci with the smallest P—values to
the top 20 loci with the largest posterior scores in the NIDDK study.
The locus information and the lowest meta—analysis P—value at each
locus are listed in Supplementary Table S4. 14 out of 20 loci are
shared between the two lists. Interestingly, the posterior—specific
loci, i.e. the loci that show up only in the list based on posterior
score, showed substantially stronger signals in the IIBDGC meta—
analysis compared to the P—value—specific loci (Supplementary Table
S4, Fig. 2A). For example, the risk locus on chromosome 10q22 was
a genome—wide significant locus in the meta—analysis (rs1250550,
Pmeta : 2.00 X 10‘”). Although the same SNP, rs1250550, had the
lowest P—value at this locus in the NIDDK dataset (PNIDDK :
5.95 X 10_5 ), the signal was not strong enough to make this locus
surpass other loci such as the one on chromosome 2q24 (rs6 733000,
PNIDDK : 2.01 X 10_5 ). However, with posterior scores, locus
10q22 was ranked as the 17th top locus, while the highest posterior
score at locus 2q24 was only 0.0142, which agrees with its weak sig—
nal in the meta—analysis result (Pmeta : 0.019). Overall, two poster—
ior—specific loci were genome—wide significant in the meta—analysis,
while the lowest Pmeta among the six P—value—specific loci was only
1.10 X 104. These results show that our method can effectively re—
duce noises likely due to LD and chance and enhance true signals at
disease risk loci.

Next, we check if SNPs with high posterior scores are more en—
riched of eQTLs. The top 1000 SNPs based on P—values are moder—
ately enriched for GTEx whole—blood eQTLs (P—value : 0.013;
hypergeometric test; fold enrichment: 1.60), while the enrichment
for the top 1000 SNPs based on the posterior scores is highly signifi—
cant (P—value : 8.58 X 10‘7; fold enrichment : 2.47). The difference
becomes even more drastic when using the top 2000 SNPs, with
P—values 0.001 and 9.25 X 10‘15 (fold enrichment 1.60 and 2.73),

analysis. The top 20 loci based on P—values in the NIDDK study are compared
with the top 20 loci based on posterior scores. Each locus is evaluated using
the maximum regional signal strength in the IIBDGC meta-analysis. Darker
color indicates stronger signals in the meta-analysis. (B) Enrichment of
whole-blood eQTLs in the top SNPs selected based on P—value and posterior

based on P—value and posterior score. The vertical axis shows the ratio of
observed and expected overlaps between eQTLs and highly ranked SNPs

respectively. When the number of top SNPs increases, the posterior—
based approach dominates the P—value—based approach in both en—
richment P—value and fold change (Fig. 2B, C). The same enrichment
pattern can be observed when using blood eQTLs from (Westra
et 41]., 2013; Supplementary Fig. S3).

In order to show how our method performs locally, we chose two
genome—wide significant loci from the IIBDGC meta—analysis. First,
within the risk locus on chromosome 1q23, two SNPs had substan—
tially stronger signals than others, i.e. rs2274910 (PMDDK :
4.40 X 10-4) and 15955371 (PNIDDK : 4.84 X 10-4). According to
the P—values, these two SNPs are indistinguishable, because the signal
at rs2274910 is only slightly stronger. However, the results from the
meta—analysis clearly show the existence of two SNP clusters with
strong signals at this locus (Fig. 3A). The cluster closer to gene
CD244, in which rs955371 resides, actually has stronger signals than
the cluster where rs2274910 is located. Interestingly, the posterior
scores capture this difference between two SNPs very well. In fact, the
posterior scores for rs955371 and rs2274910 are 0.272 and 0.208,
suggesting rs955 371 is more likely to be functional even though its P—
value is larger. The second example is the risk locus on chromosome
14q35, which is one of the 12 loci with a reduced rank under the pos—
terior scores (Supplementary Table S3). Signals at this locus were not
strong in the NIDDK study, with the smallest P—value only at 4.70
><10_3 (rs1959715). Moreover, the signal peak in the NIDDK study
(near 88.2M) was quite far from that in the meta—analysis, which res—
ides in genes GALC and GPR65 (Fig. 3B). However, the posterior
scores once again capture the signal pattern in the meta—analysis.
Signals near 88.2M on chromosome 14 are shrunk substantially,
while the SNPs in GALC and GPR65 are pushed up as the strongest
signal (rs4904410). Since these SNPs have very weak signals in their
P—values, the posterior score is still low (see Section 2). This explains

the reduced rank, because the P—value—based rank of rs1959715 was
compared with the posterior—based rank of rs4904410. It is worth
noting that the SNPs with the strongest signals in the meta—analysis,
e.g. rs8005161, were either not genotyped or dropped in the quality
control steps in the NIDDK study. It is reasonable to believe that the
posterior scores would have had an even better performance if imput—
ations had been done for the NIDDK dataset.

3.2 Application to Schizophrenia

In addition to Crohn’s disease, we also applied GenoWAP to schizo—
phrenia, a major psychiatric disorder. Psychiatric Genomics
Consortium (PGC), the largest international consortium in psych—
iatry, focuses on genetic studies of many psychiatric disorders
including schizophrenia. Two large—scale GWAS mega—analyses of
schizophrenia have been published. We applied GenoWAP to the
earlier and smaller PGC2011 study (Ripke et (11., 2011), and eval—
uated the performance using results from the larger mega—analysis
published in 2014 (Ripke et (11., 2014).

PGC2014 study identified 108 schizophrenia—associated loci,
from which we removed three loci on chromosome X because the
PGC2011 dataset did not contain any SNP on sex chromosomes.
We ranked the 1 252 637 SNPs in PGC2011 study based on their P—
values and posterior scores, respectively. Within each locus, the

rank, 1 locus (1%) had an equal rank, and the other 36 loci (34%)
had a reduced rank (Supplementary Table S5). The probability of
having an increased rank is significantly higher than that of having a
reduced rank (P—value : 0.001, one—sided binomial test).
Interestingly, among the 10 loci with the strongest signals in the
PGC2014 study, 8 had an increased rank (80%). The proportion of
increased or equal ranks gradually drops when more top loci in the
PGC2014 study were considered, showing less confidence in weaker
signals (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Next, we compared the top 20 loci with the smallest P—values to
the top 20 loci with the largest posterior scores in the PGC2011
study. In order to identify 20 independent loci, 582 SNPs were
needed when using P—value as the criterion. When posterior scores
were used to choose top signals, 548 SNPs were sufficient to identify
20 loci, showing better efficiency (Fig. 4A). A total of 14 loci could
be identified using both P—values and posterior scores. As for the
comparisons between the 6 posterior—specific loci and the 6 P—value—
specific loci, the posterior—specific loci showed better signals than
the P—value—specific loci (Supplementary Table S6, Fig. 4B) in the
PGC2014 study. Four of the 6 posterior—specific loci were genome—
wide significant in the PGC2014 study, whereas 2 P—value—specific
loci passed the genome—wide significance level. Among the 6 P—
value—specific loci, the locus on chromosome 3q26 had the strongest
signal in the PGC2014 study (P2014 : 5.35 X 10“). This locus will
be discussed in detail later.

Since imputation was done for both PGC2011 and PGC2014
studies, and the total number of SNPs is large, it is possible to com—
pare the SNP—level replication rates when the SNPs were ranked
based on P—values and posterior scores. Among the top 500 SNPs
with the largest posterior scores, 327, 267 and 152 had a P—value
lower than 5 X 104, 5 X 10'8 and 5 X 10‘15 in the PGC2014
study, respectively. When choosing the top 500 SNPs based on their
P—values, the corresponding numbers were 290, 237 and 120
(Fig. 4C), respectively. A similar pattern can be observed for the top
200 SNPs (Supplementary Fig. S5). We further performed enrich—
ment analysis using GTEx whole—blood eQTLs. The top 1000 SNPs
based on the P—values were significantly enriched for eQTLs
(P—value:5.58 X 10‘”, fold enrichment:4.66), but the enrich—
ment for the top 1000 SNPs based on the posterior scores was even
stronger (P—value:4.48 X 1042, fold enrichment:5.12). As the
number of top SNPs increased, the posterior—based top SNPs always
had stronger enrichment of eQTL than the P—value—based list
(Fig 4D, E). Similar results can be observed when using another set
of blood eQTLs (Westra et (11., 2013). The enrichment results for a
set of quantitative trait loci in human brain (Gibbs et (11., 2010) also
favor posterior scores as the number of top SNPs increase
(Supplementary Fig. S3).

Finally, we compared PGC2011 P—values, PGC2011 posterior
scores, and PGC2014 P—values at two loci to further illustrate the
performance of our method. The first locus is on chromosome 3q26.
It had the strongest signal in PGC2014 among the P—value—specific
top 20 loci (Supplementary Table S6, P2014 : 5.35 X 10‘“). Based
on the P—values in the PGC2011 study, the strongest signals reside in
the intergenic region upstream of FXR1. But the posterior scores
brought down those intergenic SNPs, and enhanced the signals in
FXR1 instead, which is in agreement with the results from
PGC2014 (Fig. 5A). In fact, from the PGC2014 P—values, we can
clearly see that the strongest signals reside in FXR1 while the signifi—
cant results for the SNPs upstream or downstream of FXR1 are
most likely due to LD. The second example is on chromosome 8q21
(Fig. 5B). In the PGC2011 study, the strongest signal at this locus
resides in the intergenic region between 89.7M and 89.8M.
However, posterior scores removed most of the correlated SNPs at
this locus, leaving three separate peaks as candidate functional
spots. The first peak lies right upstream of MMP16. The second
peak is more upstream (~89.6M), and is suggested to be the stron—
gest signal source. The SNPs with the lowest P—values in PGC2011
remained as a signal peak, but their posterior scores were not as
strong as the peak in the middle. Most interestingly, the results from
the posterior scores perfectly matched the signal patterns in the
PGC2014 study. From the lowest panel in Figure 5B, we can clearly
see two separate peaks at the same locations suggested by the poster—
ior scores, with the one near 89.6M being the strongest signal
source. Also, the SNPs between 89.7M and 89.8M had weaker sig—
nals than the peak in the middle. Notably, this entire risk locus res—
ides in an intergenic region. This example shows that our method
can effectively prioritize SNPs in the non—coding genome.

3.3 Several remarks on gene centricity

We annotated all the SNPs in the NIDDK GWAS for Crohn’s dis—
ease using the RefGene database. Among the 298 321 SNPs in this
dataset, 158 028 (53.0%) are intergenic. Among the top 1000 and
the top 2000 SNPs with small P—values, the proportion of intergenic
SNPs is relatively stable (549 out of 1000, 54.9%; and 1064 out of
2000, 53.2%). However, the proportion of intergenic SNPs substan—
tially decreased among the top SNPs with higher posterior scores

three panels show the P—values from the PGC2011 study, the posterior scores,
and the P—values from the PGC2014 study, respectively. (A) Local perform-
ance at the risk locus on chromosome 3q26. The top signals at this locus in
the PGC2011 study reside upstream of gene FXR1, while the posterior scores
pull down those signals and suggest the importance of SNPs in FXR1. This
agrees with the signal pattern in the PGC2014 study. (B) Local performance at
the risk locus on chromosome 8q21. Posterior scores diminish most of the
correlated SNPs at this locus, leaving three separate signal peaks. The peak
near 89.6M is suggested to be the strongest signal source, which cannot be
seen using P—values from the PGC2011 study. The signal peaks suggested by
posterior scores perfectly match the strongest signals in the PGC2014 study.
Figures are generated using LocusZoom (Pruim et al., 2010)

(403 out of top 1000, 40.3%; and 769 out of top 2000, 38.5%). We
repeated the analysis on PGC2011 schizophrenia GWAS. A similar
pattern could be observed (Supplementary Fig. S6). These results
show that GenoWAP does favor protein—coding regions. However, a
large proportion of non—coding signals still remain after prioritiza—
tion, indicating the necessity of considering non—coding and even
intergenic regions.

4 Discussion

In this study, we developed and applied GenoWAP to two sets of
GWAS data to illustrate its performance in GWAS signal prioritiza—
tion. Compared to P—values, GenoWAP posterior scores can better
prioritize SNPs in many different ways. At the locus level, posterior
score is more efficient in the sense that fewer SNPs are needed to
identify the same number of top loci. Moreover, noises due to
chance are effectively reduced, and the highly ranked loci using pos—
terior scores may be more likely to contain functional elements than
the top loci selected purely based on P—values. At the SNP level,
markers with high posterior scores have both better replication rates

and consistently stronger enrichment of eQTLs than the top SNPs
based on P—values. More importantly, within each risk locus identi—
fied in GWAS, posterior scores can effectively suggest potential
functional sites among a large number of correlated SNPs.

The performance of GenoWAP depends on the accuracy of func—
tional annotation. Due to our limited understanding of non—coding
genome, it is challenging to provide accurate genomic functional an—
notation. GenoCanyon is a convenient tool that provides functional
prediction at the nucleotide level, yet its predictive ability can still be
improved. Large consortia such as ENCODE (Bernstein et al., 2012)
and Roadmap project (Kundaje et al., 2015) are continuously gener—
ating diverse types of epigenetic annotation data from a variety of
cell types. The performance of GenoWAP may be further enhanced
when these data become available in the future. In our implemented
software, we allow users to use their own annotation file.
GenoWAP also depends on the quality of GWAS data. If no infor—
mation is contained in the GWAS dataset, then GenoWAP can only
provide limited insight. Finally, we emphasize that GenoWAP’s abil—
ity to identify precise functional factors is limited. GenoWAP is a re—
gion—based tool, and is powerful in identifying regions that are more
likely to have a functional impact within LD blocks. However, de—
finitive proof for functionality of any given SNP still requires thor—
ough allele—specific experimentation.

More than 2000 GWASs have been published in the past dec—
ade, and the number continues to grow. It is well known that our
ability to identify new risk loci for complex diseases has surpassed
our ability to interpret the results. However, although we are
overwhelmed by the large amount of information detected in
GWASs, evidence such as missing heritability still suggests that
many risk loci remain to be discovered. Therefore, there is press—
ing need for GWAS signal prioritization tools, and our method
has great potential for future application. Since GenoWAP uses
only P—values as the input, it is convenient to apply our method
on published results, which may help reveal potential functional
sites within large haplotype blocks, and ultimately help under—
stand disease etiology. Moreover, for multi—stage GWASs,
GenoWAP can be used to better prioritize SNPs from the discov—
ery stage to the validation planning and increase the replication
rates. Finally, next—generation sequencing is widely recognized as
the future of genomic epidemiology. However, the high cost of
sequencing usually leads to insufficient sample sizes and many
other challenging issues (Sboner et al., 2011). The combination of
GenoWAP and the rich collection of publicly available GWAS
data has the potential to provide functional candidates and guide
sequencing analysis in the future.

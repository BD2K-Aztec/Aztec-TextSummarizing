ABSTRACT

Motivation: It is well recognized that the effects of drugs are far
beyond targeting individual proteins, but rather influencing the com-
plex interactions among many relevant biological pathways.
Genome-wide expression profiling before and after drug treatment
has become a powerful approach for capturing a global snapshot of
cellular response to drugs, as well as to understand drugs’ mechanism
of action. Therefore, it is of great interest to analyze this type of tran-
scriptomic profiling data for the identification of pathways responsive
to different drugs. However, few computational tools exist for this task.
Results: We have developed FacPad, a Bayesian sparse factor
model, for the inference of pathways responsive to drug treatments.
This model represents biological pathways as latent factors and aims
to describe the variation among drug-induced gene expression alter-
nations in terms of a much smaller number of latent factors. We
applied this model to the Connectivity Map data set (build 02) and
demonstrated that FacPad is able to identify many drug—pathway as-
sociations, some of which have been validated in the literature.
Although this method was originally designed for the analysis of
drug-induced transcriptional alternation data, it can be naturally
applied to many other settings beyond polypharmacology.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the common features of complex diseases (such as cancer,
cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders) is the in-
volvement of many genes and biological pathways during the
pathogenic process. On the other hand, human physiological
systems show different degrees of robustness against single-
point perturbation due to functional redundancy, various
feedback mechanisms and other immune response. Therefore,
successful treatment of complex diseases requires ‘poly-
pharmacology’, which aims to design multi-targeting thera-
peutics and may represent a new paradigm shift in drug
discovery 0(ie et al., 2012).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Comprehensive and accurate understanding of the targeting
spectrum of various drugs is the prerequisite for practical appli-
cation of polypharmacology. Although the molecular mechan-
isms of some drugs are well studied, unexpected side effects
or toxicity of a large number of preclinical and clinical drugs
are often observed (Campillos et al., 2008; Xie et al., 2012).
Therefore, the construction of genome-wide drugitarget network
is a problem of great interest in the bioinformatics community
and beyond.

Current approaches for computational drug target identifica-
tion can be roughly categorized into three groups: ligand, pheno-
type or target based 0(ie et al., 2012). Ligand-based approaches
assume that similarity in chemical structures between drugs in-
dicates similar targeting activities. A well-known example in this
category is the QSAR method (Quantitative Structure Activity
Relationship), which uses 2D topological feature vectors
(which usually encode atom types and their bonding structure)
of drugs to train machine learning models in order to predict
their binding activity toward specific target proteins 0(ie et al.,
2012; Yamanishi et al., 2010). However, decent performance of
ligand-based approach requires a large enough number of known
ligands for target proteins of interest, which may be difficult to
meet in practice.

A second class of methods associates different drugs by com-
paring the biological phenotype responses, such as cell lines’ gene
expression proﬁles or proteomic data 0(ie et al., 2012). Seminal
work in this direction includes the national NCI-60 project
(Shoemaker, 2006), which screened 60 human tumor cell lines
against more than 100 000 compounds and constructed a public
repository for the basal gene expression and drug sensitivity in-
formation. The Connectivity Map project initiated by the Broad
Institute went a step further (Lamb, 2007; Lamb et al., 2006).
Although it only focused on five human cancer cell lines, the
project generated genome-wide expression profiles both before
and after drug treatment for 1309 compounds. In this way, com-
pounds can be connected into a network by comparing their
ranked lists of up- and down-regulated genes (Iorio et al.,
2009, 2010). Other phenotype information such as cell imaging
and side effects have also been utilized to associate different
drugs and to make inference about their potential targets
(Campillos et al., 2008; Young et al., 2008).

The third category of methods looks at the similarity between
target proteins to predict drugitarget interactions, based on
structure, sequence, evolutionary as well as functional informa-
tion 0(ie et al., 2012). Several recent studies integrate sequence
features of targets with ligand ﬁngerprints to train statistical

learning models for drugtarget interaction prediction (He et al.,
2010; Nagamine et al., 2009; Vina et al., 2009; Yamanishi et al.,
2008). Another well-known method in this category is docking
analysis, which predicts the preferred orientation of drug candi-
dates to potential target proteins when they are bound to each
other to form a stable complex (Kitchen et al., 2004). However,
docking cannot be applied to proteins whose 3D structures are
unknown. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to use the docking on a
genome-wide scale Wamanishi et al., 2010).

The method proposed in this article falls into the second cat-
egory, phenotype-based approaches. It is designed for the ana-
lysis of genome-wide transcriptional response profiles upon
screening of a large number of compounds, which shares similar
data structure with the Connectivity Map project. Previous stu-
dies on treatment response data usually focus on differential ex-
pression analysis: to identify the most up- and down-regulated
genes for each drug and then check for pathway enrichment of
these response signatures (Iskar et al., 2010; Smalley et al., 2010)
or to deﬁne certain drug similarity metrics based on the ranked
gene list as the Connectivity Map project (Iorio et al., 2010;
Lamb et al., 2006). Drawbacks with the former approach include
that it only utilizes the information of the most differentially
expressed (DE) genes while disregarding all the other data
points. Moreover, the choice of the DE cutoff is subjective, lead-
ing to potentially inconsistent pathway enrichment results. The
Connectivity Map approach mainly aims at assessing the simi-
larity between different drugs or the construction of a
‘drug-network’, rather than direct identiﬁcation of target biolo-
gical pathways of various compounds.

Target pathway identification is a critical step for therapeutics
design in the age of systems pharmacology (Zhao and Iyengar,
2012). Compared with traditional methods focusing on the infer-
ence of separate target genes, taking the pathway perspective
allows a more integrative understanding of the mechanism of
action and physiological effects of compounds. In order to ad-
dress the aforementioned limitations of existing analysis proced-
ures, we propose ‘FacPad’, which applies a Bayesian sparse
factor model to explain the gene-wise treatment response in
terms of latent biological pathway activity changes upon individ-
ual treatment. By encoding pathways as latent factors, FacPad
naturally incorporates prior knowledge on pathwayigene asso-
ciation structure to aid the inference on drug targets.

The idea of FacPad is conceptually related to one of our pre-
vious studies ‘iFad’, which stands for an integrative factor ana-
lysis model for drugipathway association inference (Ma and
Zhao, 2012). However, distinct from FacPad, iFad aims to
jointly analyze two phenotype proﬁles measured across the
same set of samples, that is, two matrices with the same
number of columns (sample size) but different number of rows
(dimension of the feature space). The two data matrices are
decomposed using a common set of latent factors, which repre-
sent biological pathways. Therefore, iFad can be applied to the
analysis of paired transcription profiles (basal level gene expres-
sion, before drug treatment) and drug sensitivity data (‘GISO’
values, drug concentrations required to inhibit growth by 50%)
across the same cell lines, in order to infer the geneipathway and
drugipathway associations simultaneously.

Due to its general factor model framework, FacPad can be
easily applied to many other settings apart from drug-induced

pathway response data. From the perspective of data mining,
this method is basically performing dimension reduction ana-
lysis: it aims to explain the variation in the original observed
variables in terms of a much smaller number of latent factors.
Different from traditional factor analysis or PCA, FacPad is
more convenient to use when there exist certain prior knowledge
on the association pattern between the latent factors and the
observed independent features.

The remaining of this article is structured as follows: we will
ﬁrst describe the statistical model of FacPad in Section 2; in
Section 3, application of the model on the Connectivity Map
data set is presented; the article concludes with a brief discussion
on issues worth of note and potential future work.

2 METHODS

2.1 Model description

FacPad is designed for the analysis of a GxJ data matrix Y, which
describes the genome-wide transcriptional response upon different treat-
ments. G is the total number of genes measured by the microarray plat-
form (or proteins if proteomics data is utilized), whereas J is the number
of treatments which have been screened. Each treatment is usually a
speciﬁc drug at a given dosage with a speciﬁc treatment time.
Therefore, the number of unique drugs tested is often smaller than the
number of treatments. Each entry in matrix Y is the response value of a
single gene upon a certain treatment and is usually computed as the ratio
(or fold change) of the gene expression levels after versus before treat-
ment. Prior information on pathway structure is represented as a G x K
binary matrix L, where K is the number of pathways included in the
analysis. This information can be retrieved from many public pathway
databases such as KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2012; Kotera et al., 2012),
MetaCyc (Caspi et al., 2012) and so on (Bader et al., 2006). If the gth gene
belongs to the kth pathway, L[g, k] = 1 and it takes value 0 otherwise.

In order to make inference on the target pathways of different treat-
ments, FacPad applies a Bayesian sparse factor model for the decompos-
ition of matrix Y, which was originally proposed for microarray data
analysis (West, 2003). This type of model is well suited for the research
objective here: ﬁrst, under the Bayesian setting, prior knowledge on path-
way structures can be easily utilized to guide the inference process;
second, a sparse model represents a more realistic description of the as-
sociation pattern between pathways and genes. The outline of the model
is as follows:

Y: WX+E,E.,J- ~ N(0,):)

~ 71 71 71 71
2:dtag{t1 ,12 ,...,rg ,...,rG}

X1“- ~ N0rmal(0, 1)

0, If L ,k = 0
WM 2 { 71 .g
N(0,rw ), If Lg) =1
1,, ~ Gamma(orw, ,8,,)

Matrix W is the G x K factor loading matrix describing the association
strength between the genes and the pathways. Most entries in matrix W
are 0, with the sparsity structure deﬁned exactly the same as matrix L.
For each non-zero entry in matrix W, Wg’k, we put a normal prior with
mean 0 and precision 1w. 1,, can be either set to a constant or assumed to
follow a conjugate Gamma distribution. In the following analysis, we set
15,: 1. Matrix X is the K x J latent factor matrix, with each factor rep-
resenting the treatment response of a specific biological pathway. Entries
in matrix X are assumed to follow the standard normal distribution.
Matrix E is the GxJ noise matrix. Each column of E is generated
from a multivariate normal distribution with mean 0 and a G x G

diagonal covariance matrix 2. The precision of the gth gene, 1g, is
assumed to follow a Gamma prior with shape parameter org and rate
parameters ,Bg. Under this setting, we can derive the prior probability
of different components of the model, as well as the complete joint pos-
terior probability (see the Supplementary Material for details). An intui-
tive illustration of the model is shown in Figure 1.

2.2 Inference algorithm

For Bayesian inference, Gibbs sampling is a widely used technique to
approximate the joint distribution of models with a large number of
parameters. However, standard Gibbs sampler may suffer from poor
mixing due to the dependence between matrices W and Z in this case.
Therefore, we have utilized a modiﬁed collapsed Gibbs sampling algo-
rithm based on several previous studies (Pournara and Wernisch, 2007;
Rattray et al., 2009; Sabatti and James, 2006). The outline of the algo-
rithm is listed below (Fig. 2). Detailed derivations of the posterior con-
ditional distributions are provided in the Supplementary Material. We
have implemented the above algorithm as the R package ‘FacPad’, which
is publicly available on CRAN (http://cran.open-source-solution.org/
web/packages/FacPad/) and also our group’s website (http://bioinfor-
maticsmed.yale.edu/group/).

2.3 Data simulation for model parameter selection

In order to choose the Gamma parameters (org and ﬁg) used in the infer-
ence algorithm for the FacPad model, we simulated the binary link matrix
L, loading matrix W, latent factor activity matrix X and the error matrix
E, using the setting shown in Table 1. We then compared the following
pairs oforg and ﬁg values: (0.7, 0.3), (1, 0.1) and (1, 0.01). For each pair of
Gamma parameters, we run the Gibbs sampling for 20 000 iterations and

L G (nrow) = 100, K (ncol) = 20, density (% of 1-entries) = 0.1

X K (nrow) = 20, J (ncol) = 30

E G (nrow) = 100, J (nool) = 30, 0g 2 0.2

 

the ﬁrst 5000 iterations were discarded as burn-in period. For each of the
remaining 15 000 iterations, we computed the estimated matrix Y = 
and then took the average for each entry across the 15000 iterations
to get the ﬁnal estimate for matrix Y. We then calculate the

root-mean-squared error (RMSE) =, /Z(Y7Y)2/lcngth(Y).

2.4 Preprocessing of the connectivity map data

We applied ‘FacPad’ to the analysis of microarray data sets generated by
the Connectivity Map project (Lamb, 2007; Lamb et al., 2006). The cur-
rent version of the web interface (CMap Build 02, http://www.broadin-
stitute.org/crnap/) provides public download of genome-wide
transcriptional proﬁles of ﬁve human cancer cell lines (MCF7: human
breast cancer; HL60: human promyelocytic leukemia; ssMCF7: MCF7
grown in a different vehicle; PC3: human epithelial prostate cancer;
SKMEL5: human skin melanoma) both before and after the treatments
of 1309 distinct bioactive small molecules. In all, there are 7056
Affymetrix microarrays, among which 6100 arrays are from drug-treated
cell lines and the others are control samples. Three microarray platforms
were used: 807 HG-U133A arrays, 220 HT_HG-U133A_EA arrays and
6029 HT_HG-U133A arrays, belonging to 302 different batches.

We downloaded the raw.CEL ﬁles of all the 7056 arrays from the
CMap database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/cel_ﬁle_chunks.
jsp). First, basic quality check of the.CEL data was performed using
the NUSE (Normalized Unscaled Standard Error) and RLE (Relative
Log Expression) metrics (Brettschneider et al., 2008), which are provided
in the R package ‘affyPLM’. For every 25 arrays from the same platform,
boxplots of NUSE and RLE were drawn and arrays with bad quality
were discarded. After array ﬁltering, we performed GCRMA normaliza-
tion on the.CEL ﬁles (also within each platform, respectively) using R
package ‘gcrrna’. Next, for each retained treatment array, the correspond-
ing control sample was identiﬁed (if there are more than one control
array, then for each probeset, the average value across all controls was
computed). After removing the treatment arrays with no control, tran-
scriptional response value for each probeset was calculated as the fold
change (treatment data/control data). The ﬁnal processing step was to
remove potential batch effects using the function ‘removeBatcthfect’ of
the R package ‘limma’.

In the following analysis, we only used the data from the HT_HG-
U133A array platform, which consists of 4466 expression response pro-
ﬁles, representing 1084 different compounds. More details about data
from the HT_HG-U133A array platform are shown in Table 2.

The Affymetrix HT_HG-U133A array platform covers 22 277 probe
sets genome-wide. Within each cell line panel, the top 5000 most varying
probe sets were selected, which were then mapped to KEGG pathways
using the DAVID online annotation database (Huang da et al., 2009a, b).
A second ﬁltering step was applied from the pathway perspective, where
only pathways with more than 10 associated probe sets were retained.
Finally, probe sets not belonging to these retained pathways were
excluded.

3 RESULTS

We then applied FacPad to the analysis of the treatment re-
sponse profiles of three tumor cell line panels from the
Connectivity Map project (Lamb, 2007; Lamb et al., 2006).
After preprocessing as described in Section 2, there remained
2349 treatment proﬁles for the MCF cell line panel, 746 profiles
for the HL60 panel and 1371 proﬁles for the PC3 panel. For each
panel, around 1500 probe sets mapped to ~130 KEGG path-
ways were used in the analysis (Table 2). The binary matrix L
was also constructed based on these probe setipathway associ-
ations, which in turn determines the sparsity structure of loading
matrix W. Therefore, for the MCF7 cell line panel, dim (matrix
Y): 1533 x 2349, dim (matrix L): 1533 x 123; for HL60, dim
(matrix Y) : 1606 x 749, dim (matrix L): 1606 x 130; for PC3,
dim (matrix Y): 1538 x 1371, dim (matrix L): 1538 x 126.
Figure 3 shows the sparsity pattern of matrix L of the three
cell line panels.

3.1 Parameter setting for the collapsed Gibbs sampling
algorithm

The Gamma parameters (org and ﬁg) were chosen based on prac-
tical experiments Via simulation, as described in Section 2.3
(Table 1). The RMSE of estimated matrix Y for the three
pairs of Gamma parameters tested are: (i) ag:0.7, ﬁg:0.3,
RMSE:0.09936; (ii) ag:l, ﬁg:0.l, RMSE:0.09606 and
(iii) org: 1, ﬁg:0.01, RMSE:0.09553. Therefore, we set
org: 1, ﬁg: 0.01, for the following analysis presented in this art-
icle. For Gibbs sampling, we set the number of iterations to
30 000 for HL60 and PC3 panel (ﬁrst 5000 iterations as
burn-in), whereas 20 000 for MCF panel (ﬁrst 7500 iterations
as bum-in) since the sample size of this panel is much larger
and each iteration of the Gibbs sampling takes more time.
Approximately, each iteration of the Gibbs sampling takes 13 s
for HL60 panel, 20 s for PC3 panel and 37 s for MCF7 panel. To
reduce the effect of auto-correlation between adjacent iterations
and the data storage burden, we only recorded the Gibbs sam-
pling results every 10th iteration. The number of burn-in iter-
ations was chosen based on the MCMC trace plot. The sample
trace plots are shown in Supplementary Figure S1, which illus-
trate the sampled elements/entries in vector 1', matrix X and
matrix W during the running of the chain. One issue with
factor model is the sign flipping problem: changing the sign of
matrix X and matrix W at the same time will not change the
estimated value of matrix Y. Since we are more interested in the
inference of treatmentipathway association strength (the abso-
lute value of matrix X), rather than the sign of the correlation
between probe sets and pathways or between treatments and
pathways, we only plotted the absolute values of selected entries
in matrix X and W.

3.2 Estimated gene—pathway and treatment—pathway
association relationships of MCF7, HL60 and
PC3 cell line panels of connectivity map data

As mentioned earlier, in the analysis presented here, we mainly
focus on the inference of the association strength between genes/
treatments and the KEGG pathways, rather than the positive or
negative signs of the correlation. Therefore, we estimated the
absolute value of latent factor matrix |X| (treatmentipathway
association) and the loading matrix lm (geneipathway associ-
ation) by taking the average of the absolute value of each entry
across the Gibbs sampling iterations (after excluding the burn-in
samples). A Visual representation of the inferred matrix |X| is
shown in Figure 4, whereas histogram showing the distribution
of inferred matrix |X| and |W| entries is shown in Supplementary
Figure S2. From the heatmaps, it can be seen that for all the
three tumor cell line panels, the treatmentipathway association
relationships exhibit certain modular structure. It is not unusual
that several treatments are strongly associated with several path-
ways at the same time, forming a notable bi-cluster in the
heatmap.

In order to validate the inferred treatmentipathway associ-
ations, we resorted to the cataloged drug target information
from the comparative toxicogenomics database (CTD; Davis
et al., 2011). CTD contains curated interactions between chem-
icals and genes/proteins. It also provides a list of pathways that

are statistically enriched among the genes/proteins that interact
with a chemical. The signiﬁcance of enrichment was calculated
by the hypergeometric distribution and adjusted for multiple
testing using the Bonferroni method. We downloaded the
‘chemicalipathway enriched associations’ zip file from their
web interface (URL: http://ctdbase.org/downloads/#chem—
pathwaysenriched), updated as of March 14, 2012. The total
number of drugs included in the CTD database is 143 668,
among which 5460 drugs have enriched associations with at

least 1 of 230 KEGG pathways. The total number of chem-
icalipathway interactions is 152556, leading to a 5460x 230
drugipathway interaction matrix with density 12.15%.

Since the chemical information documented in CTD is incom-
plete, drugipathway associations inferred by matrix |X| but not
recorded in CTD may also be true interactions, rather than false
positives. Therefore, the true positive rate (aka sensitivity or
recall) is a more reliable performance measure here. Detailed
information about this analysis is shown in Table 3. For the
three estimated latent factor matrix |Xl, after excluding treat-
ments not included in CTD, we checked whether larger entries
in matrix |X| are more likely to indicate true (CTD-validated)
drugipathway associations, using a metric similar to the
so—called ‘recall enhancement’ (Zhou et al., 2010). First, we
ranked all the entries’ values of matrix |X| from largest to
smallest and checked whether the corresponding drugpathway
associations are conﬁrmed by CTD. Then, we calculated the fold
enrichment of true positives compared with random selection,
for increasing number of top-ranked entries. An illustration of
this calculation procedure using matrix |X| derived from the
HL60 panel is shown in Table 4. The last column, fold enrich-
ment of true positives (FE_TP), is computed as follows:

TP _ TP x (#AILEntries)

FE_TP : _
Rand0m_TP P x (Entry_Rank)

 

where ‘TP’ stands for ‘number of true positives’, ‘Random_TP’
stands for ‘expected number of true positives by random selec-
tion’, P refers to the total number of positives in the whole matrix
and ‘Entry_Rank’ stands for the number of top-ranked entries
included in counting TP. We also checked the fold enrichment
for false positives (FE_FP), which is deﬁned similarly:

FP _ FP x (#AILEntries)
Rand0m_FP _ N x (Entry_Rank)

Figure 5 shows the ‘FE_TP’ and ‘FE_FP’ for each of the three
cell line panels (only plotting top 10000 entries here since the
remaining part has the same ascending/descending trend). It
can be seen that both the peaks of ‘FE_TP’ and the bottoms
of ‘FE_FP’ are achieved simultaneously at a very top rank
(top 0.0113% for HL60 panel, top 0.00136% for PC3 panel
and top 0.6205% for MCF7 panel). With more and more
lower-ranked entries included, ‘FE_TP’ gradually decreases
while ‘FE_FP’ gradually increases, both of which ﬁnally approxi-
mate to 1 (same as random selection). Therefore, the values of
matrix |X] entries can fairly reﬂect the association strength be-
tween drugs and KEGG pathways.

We then checked the rank positions of different pathways
for individual treatment (lower ranks indicate higher matrix |X|
values). The results of several representative treatments for each
of the three cell line panels are shown in Supplementary Tables
S1, S2 and S3.

3.3 Representative treatment—pathway modules identiﬁed
in the latent factor matrix X by F acPad

In the following, we will brieﬂy describe a few number of repre-
sentative treatmentipathway modules detected in the latent
factor matrix |X| (notable bi-clusters in the heatmaps of
Figure 4), as a demonstration of the analysis result on
Connectivity Map data sets. Several selected modules are listed
in Table 5. And, we will discuss one module from each of the
three cell line panels below.

For the HL60 cell line panel, one module includes the path-
ways ‘Arachidonic acid metabolism’, ‘Retinol metabolism’ and

‘Huntington’s disease’, with corresponding drugs ‘tretinoin’ and
‘isotretinoin’. Both tretinoin and isotretinoin are retinoic acids,
whose administration into human body will naturally result in
the involvement of the above two fatty acid metabolism path-
ways. The ‘Huntington’s disease’ pathway contains many genes
which are potential targets of tretinoin and isotretinoin (e.g.
CASP3, BAX). There have also been a number of studies
demonstrating the effect of retinoids and related compounds
on the treatment of neuro-inﬁammatory disease such as schizo-
phrenia, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s diseases
(Lane and Bailey, 2005; Luthi-Carter et al., 2000; O’Reilly
et al., 2006).

For the PC3 cell line panel, one module associates the ‘antigen
processing and presentation pathways’ with many drugs that are
closely related to the immune system, such as ebselen, nifedipine,
disulﬁram, 15-delta prostaglandin J2, withaferin A and MG-262.
The remaining drugs in this module have no or very little infor-
mation on associated pathways from CTD, but may also be
related to antigen processing or other immune functions based
on our additional literature mining. For example, mometasone
has been shown to inhibit adhesion molecular expression (an
important player during immune response) in psoriasis (Berti
et al., 1998), as well as to have effects on mammalian allergic
rhinitis model (Tsumuro et al., 2005).

For the MCF7 panel, it shares the retinol pathway module
with HL60 and also the antigen module with PC3. Another not-
able module in this panel is the one with drugs anisomycin and
cephaeline. Anisomycin (a.k.a. ﬂagecidin) is an antibiotic which
can inhibit protein biosynthesis. Cephaeline is an alkaloid which
has effect on stimulating the stomach lining and inducing vomit-
ing. In this module, the two drugs are inferred to be associated
with a number of signaling pathways, such as ‘Toll—like receptor
signaling pathway’ and ‘NOD-like receptor signaling pathway’,
which can be validated from the CTD drugpathway interaction
catalog. ‘Leukocyte transendothelial migration pathway’ is also
relevant here since it is a necessary transitive step in most
immune-related signal transduction.

3.4 Comparison with GSEA

We compared the performance of FacPad with the well-known
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, GSEA (Mootha et al., 2003;

Subramanian et al., 2005), using the HL60, PC3 and MCF data
set. The R code for GSEA analysis was downloaded from the
following website http: //www.broadinstitute. org/gsea/down—
loads.jsp. For each treatment within the same cell line panel
(as shown in Table 3), we ﬁrst ranked all the genes according
to the treatment/control ratio. Then for each KEGG pathway, a
KolmogoroviSmirnov running sum is computed. The resulting
enrichment score (ES, real number between —1 and +1) indicates
how significantly a specific pathway is up-regulated (ES>0) or
down-regulated (ES < 0) upon this treatment. We then compared
the PrecisioniRecall curves generated from |ES| by GSEA with
those generated from matrix |X| by FacPad, still using the CTD
as the validation resource (Figure 6). PrecisioniRecall curves are
more suitable to the current situation than the ROC curves (True
Positive Rate versus False Positive Rate). Comparing the differ-
ent metrics used by PrecisioniRecall curve and ROC curve:

pathway interactions is unknown and it is impossible to get the
accurate validation set), the calculation for FP (false positives)
and TN (true negatives) is much less reliable than TP (true posi-
tives) and FN (false negatives). Therefore, PrecisioniRecall
curves are more appropriate and less misleading than ROC
curves when only a small proportion of all the positives are
known in the validation set, which has been noted in proteini
protein interaction prediction studies (Hue et al., 2010) as well as
in the machine learning community (Davis and Goadrich, 2006).
From Figure 6, it can be seen that FacPad always gives a better
PrecisioniRecall curve than GSEA. The different performance
may result from the fact that GSEA is a rank-based method and
treats all the genes in the same pathway with equal weight. In
contrast, FacPad assigns different loadings to genes in the same
pathway and borrows information across all the treatments.

3.5 A further note on the choice of sparsity structure of
loading matrix W

For the model presented here, the sparsity structure of loading
matrix W is completely determined by the pathwayigene associ-
ation relationship derived from KEGG database. However, the
loading matrix W may be sparser in that some geneipathway
coefficients might be close to 0 even if their associations are
documented in KEGG. Indeed, when we check on the estimated
loadings of the genes in the same pathway, it is usually the case
that only a small proportion of genes have high loadings (e.g.
with a absolute value >0.5). One of the advantages of the
Bayesian sparse factor framework utilized by FacPad is that it
allows convenient incorporation of more ﬂexibility in the sparsity
structure of the loading matrix W. To achieve this, we just have
to add another layer between loading matrix W and the binary
geneipathway association matrix L. It is another binary matrix
Z representing the true sparsity structure of matrix W. Each
entry in matrix Z is assumed to follow a Bernoulli distribution
with the probability of taking 1/0 depending on the correspond-
ing entry in matrix L:

7709  Lgkzo

 . 1
g g 1—m, If Lg,k=1
0 if Zg,k=0

Wg’k _ {M0, 1,;1 , if 2M :1

As for the collapsed Gibbs sampling, it is only needed to add
one more step for the inference of matrix Z before the inference
of matrix W (see Appendix 4 of Supplementary Material for
details). The parameter no and n1 are used to ﬁne tune the simi-
larity between the link matrix L and the true sparsity structure
matrix Z. If both no and n1 are set to 0, the model goes back to
the original version described earlier.

We compared the result of the modified model with the ori-
ginal simpliﬁed version using the HL60 data set. We set no to 0
and tested ﬁve different values of n1: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8. We
ran the Collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for 20 000 iterations
and recorded the result every other 10th iteration. The ﬁrst
10000 iterations were discarded as bum-in period, whereas the
remaining samples were averaged to estimate the binary indica-
tor matrix Z, the absolute value of loading matrix |W| and the
latent factor activity matrix |X|. As shown in Table 6, the total

number of 1-entries in matrix Z decreases with n1 increasing, but
the l-entries inferred using n1:0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 are always a
subset of the 1-entries inferred using n1 :0. The corresponding
fold enrichment is shown in parentheses, calculated as:
N m2 x length(Z)/(N1 x N2). Figure 7 shows the distribution of
non-zero loadings in matrix |W| (as indicated by estimated

but higher non-zero loadings.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we have presented a Bayesian sparse factor ana-
lysis model, FacPad, for the inference of drugipathway associ-
ations using treatment response data generated from microarray
platforms. This method treats biological pathways as latent fac-
tors and explains the gene-wise treatment response variation in
items of the latent pathway variables. This approach is different
from previous methods for such data, since it does not merely
calculate the similarity among different drugs, but tries to detect
the association strength between drugs and pathways through
large-scale data mining. Although this method was designed
for the analysis of gene expression data, it can also be directly
applied to proteomic and other high-dimensional data sets. The
latter half of this article focuses on information mining on the

Connectivity Map data, which represents an excellent repository
of treatment response proﬁles of a broad range of small bioactive
compounds. We have shown that FacPad has good performance
for the inference of true positive drugipathway associations. It
can also predict the target pathways and possible mechanism of
action for drugs with little known information in existing drug
databases. We implemented the model as an R package for
public access. It is worthy of note that the FacPad model was
developed under the assumption that all the latent factors needed
for decomposition of the data matrix are known (here, the latent
factors are KEGG pathways mapped to by the measured genes).
Therefore, it should not be applied directly without modiﬁcation
when the real latent factors are completely unknown. Similar to
other Bayesian method, relatively good computational resource
is required for running this program on large-scale data sets. We
used the Yale computing cluster which usually takes 18h to
ﬁnish 5000 iterations of Gibbs sampling on the HL60 data set.
For future studies, it will be of interest to try different encoding
of the latent factors. Instead of using a linear factor model, other
data mining techniques may also achieve good result.

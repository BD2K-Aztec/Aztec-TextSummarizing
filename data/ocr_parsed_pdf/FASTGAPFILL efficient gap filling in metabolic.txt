“The dimensions are given as metabolites >< reactions.
bComp, compartments.

CPreprocessing includes computing the ﬂux consistent metabolic model, merging of UX for all compartments of S and adding solvable blocked reactions BS.
Note: Equal weighting of all reactions was used. See Supplementary Table S1 for candidate gap—ﬁlling solutions.

Computing a compact ﬂux consistent subnetwork of a global model.
FASTGAPFILL computes a subnetwork of S UX , consisting of all core
reactions, plus a minimal number of reactions from UX, such that all
reactions in the resulting compact subnetwork are ﬁux consistent. This is
achieved by using a slightly modiﬁed version of FASTCORE, in which a
vector of linear weightings prioritizes the addition of reactions within
UX. For instance, one may prioritize the addition of metabolic reactions
from U over transport reactions from X, or, by varying the weightings on
non-core reactions, alternate compact sets of gap-ﬁlling reactions may be
identiﬁed.

Optional analysis of gap-ﬁlling reactions. We provide the option to
compute a ﬂux vector that maximizes the ﬂux through each blocked
reaction in turn, while minimizing the Euclidean norm of ﬂux through
the subnetwork of S UX computed by one call to FASTGAPFILL. Note that
ﬂux through more than one solvable blocked reaction may be necessary
to fill a gap, and that the computed ﬁux vector may not be of minimum
cardinality.

Computing stoichiometric consistency. Many reaction databases con-
tain stoichiometric inconsistencies (Gevorgyan et al., 2008), where the
stoichiometry for at least two reactions is inconsistent with conservation
of mass. For instance, the reactions A = B and A = B+ C are stoichio-
metrically inconsistent, as no positive molecular mass can be assigned to
A, B and C, such that the mass on both sides of both reactions is equal.
FASTGAPFILL allows to identify stoichiometrically inconsistent reactions
from ﬁlling gaps, by using the scalable approach for approximate cardin-
ality maximization used within FASTCORE, to compute a maximal set of
metabolites in U that are involved in reactions that conserve mass.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

An open source, MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc.), implementation
of FASTGAPFILL is available as a cross—platform desktop com—
puter extension to the openCOBRA toolbox (Schellenberger
et al., 2011).

4 DISCUSSION

We applied FASTGAPFILL to five metabolic models (Table l),
demonstrating its broad applicability and scalability for various
sizes of the gap—ﬁlling problem. Alternate gap—ﬁlling solutions
can be computed by changing weightings on non—core reactions
in the preprocessed problem. Note that all candidate metabolic

and transport reactions are hypotheses requiring experimental
validation (Rolfsson et al., 2011). Our implementation provides
an openCOBRA (Schellenberger et al., 2011) compatible version
of the KEGG reaction database; however, any other universal
reaction database could be used with FASTGAPFILL, so long as the
same input format is maintained and care is taken to correctly
identify identical metabolites. FASTGAPFILL is the first scalable
approach to identify candidate missing knowledge in compart—
mentalized metabolic reconstructions, and the approach is
applicable to any form of biochemical network gap—filling
problem.

Abstract

Summary: One of the solutions proposed for addressing the challenge ofthe overwhelming abun—
dance of genomic sequence and other biological data is the use of the Hadoop computing frame—
work. Appropriate tools are needed to set up computational environments that facilitate research
of novel bioinformatics methodology using Hadoop. Here, we present cl—dash, a complete starter
kit for setting up such an environment. Configuring and deploying new Hadoop clusters can be
done in minutes. Use of Amazon Web Services ensures no initial investment and minimal oper—
ation costs. Two sample bioinformatics applications help the researcher understand and learn the
principles of implementing an algorithm using the MapReduce programming pattern.

1 Introduction

The unprecedented abundance of sequence and other biological data
generated in recent years has been straining traditional analysis
approaches. A promising solution to the challenges of biological ‘big
data’ is the Hadoop ecosystem of distributed computing tools com-
bined with a cloud service. A Hadoop system runs on a cluster of ar-
bitrary size consisting of commodity computers. It is based on a
distributed file system and software implementing the MapReduce
programming pattern. A growing number of applications of
Hadoop/MapReduce in bioinformatics have been recently reported
(reviewed by O’Driscoll et (11., 2013; Zhou et (11., 2013; Zou et 111.,
2013i

Setting up a working Hadoop cluster remains a complex and
time-consuming process. It can pose a considerable barrier to a bio-
informatics researcher, who is interested to learn about this new
technology and test it on their favorite problem. Some excellent de-
ployment and cluster management tools already exist, but they fall
short when considering the specific needs of a researcher primarily
interested in a quick and easy setup for experimentation and bench-
marking. For example, tools targeting enterprise-level clusters

sacrifice simplicity for richness of features (e.g. Cloudera Manager,
http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/products-and-servic
es/cloudera-enterprise/cloudera-manager.html and Apache
AMBARI, http://ambari.apache.org/). Systems such as Cloudgene
(Schénherr et (11., 2012) and CloudDOE (Chung et (11., 2014) have
been specifically developed for bioinformatics applications.
However, they focus on graphical user interfaces and ease of use for
end users, and do not work well for benchmarking in cases where
multiple clusters of different sizes and settings need to be quickly de-
ployed and redeployed. Amazon Web Services (AWS) (http://aws.
amazon.com/) offers the Elastic MapReduce service, which is easy
to use, but has no built-in data persistence, and software customiza-
tion is complex.

We set out to develop a tool for Hadoop cluster deployment and
management, which specifically addresses the needs of bioinformati-
cians exploring the applicability of this technology to their research.
Features of the tool that we considered critical included rapid and
simple creation of new clusters of different sizes, flexible configur-
ation and custom software installation, data persistence during
intermittent usage and low cost of initial investment and during

We have routinely used cl—dash in our own research into de—
veloping novel big data tools for bioinformatics. For example, we
have explored the feasibility of the Hadoop framework to store,
manage and analyze large—scale human genomic variation data. We
have found the system to be ideally suited for a highly dynamic
work environment focused on experimentation.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Current challenges in microRNA (miRNA) research are
to improve the identification of in vivo mRNA targets and clarify the
complex interplay existing between a specific miRNA and multiple
biological networks. MiRonTop is an online java web tool that
integrates DNA microarrays or high-throughput sequencing data to
identify the potential implication of miRNAs on a specific biological
system. It allows a rapid characterization of the most pertinent
mRNA targets according to several existing miRNA target prediction
approaches. It also provides useful representations of the enrichment
scores according to the position of the target site along the 3’-UTR,
where the contribution of the sites located in the vicinity of the stop
codon and of the polyA tail can be clearly highlighted. It provides
different graphs of miRNA enrichment associated with up- or down-
regulated transcripts and different summary tables about selections
of mRNA targets and their functional annotations by Gene Ontology.

1 INTRODUCTION

MiRNAs appear capable to block translation and also stimulate
mRNA degradation, with translational repression often preceding
mRNA degradation. Several mechanisms of miRNA action,
including block of cap binding or elongation, increased ribosome
drop-off rate or increased de-adenylation, have already been
proposed (Guo et (11., 2010). It remains, however, that target
recognition follows a complex set of rules dominated by the
existence of a perfect match between 6 and 8 nt located in the
5’ region of the miRNA (called the ‘seed’) and the target mRNA
(Grimson et (11., 2007). The ability of miRNAs to interact with
many targets and the possibility for some of them to share a same
target increase tremendously the complexity of many biological
networks. In that context, an experimental validation of in silico
predictions appears quite necessary. Many available target prediction
softwares combine a search for a perfect seed match between
miRNA and 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR) and a conservation
of the interaction across species. In fact, comparison of results

obtained with several of these computational tools show signiﬁcant
divergences. MiRonTop aims at detecting inﬂuence of miRNAs on
gene expression proﬁles by analyzing potential overrepresentation
of speciﬁc miRNAs targets across an experimental gene set. Other
tools have been recently described to explore miRNA inﬂuence on
datasets (Alexiou et (11., 2010; Antonov et (11., 2009; van Dongen
et (11., 2008). MiRonTop provides several novel and complementary
information including (i) the possibility to screen and compare
miRNA signatures using different target prediction tools; (ii) options
to calculate enrichment scores according to the spatial distribution
of predicted targets sites along the transcript, since true sites may
be preferentially located in Close vicinity of stop codons and
polyadenylation sites (Chi et (11., 2009; Majoros and Ohler, 2007);
and (iii) access to Gene Ontology functional annotations of the
different gene lists. Overall, these different modes of representation
increase the sensitivity of the research in order to deﬁne a set of
either mRNA or miRNAs associated with the selected experiment.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Description of the interface

MiRonTop takes as input the results of a global mRNA expression
data. An acceptable format corresponds to a tab-delimited text ﬁle
containing a unique identiﬁer (HGNC gene symbol, NCBI gene
ID, Affymetrix or Agilent probe identiﬁers), a signal intensity, a
log; ratio between two experimental conditions and a statistical
value (P-value or odds ratio). MiRonTop maintains a relational
database linking DNA microarray probes identiﬁers with NCBI
gene IDs, which are used as references by the application.
The database also keeps targeting relationships between NCBI
gene IDs and miRNA predicted by Targetscan, MicroCosm,
Miranda, Pictar and an exact seed search (2—7, 1—8 or 2—8 ﬁrst
nucleotides of the miRNA) across genes 3’-UTRs and coding
sequence (CDS). Predictions can be tuned with several adjustable
parameters deﬁning expressed genes (signal intensityicut-offl)
and statistically signiﬁcant genes (expressed genes having |log2
ratio| 3 cut-off2 and P-value f cut-off3 or odds ratio 3 cut-off3i).
The three cut-offs, selected by the end-user, are used to deﬁne
two sets: the down-regulated gene set (where enrichment for
mRNA targets of up-regulated miRNAs should be detected) and
the up-regulated gene set (where mRNA targets for down-regulated
miRNAs are expected). For each miRNA considered, an enrichment
of its predicted targets according to one selected prediction tool
is deﬁned for the ‘Down’ and the ‘Up’ gene sets, signiﬁcance

being evaluated using the hypergeometric law. The interface then
displays for each miRNA the relationship between a Benjamini and
Hochberg-adjusted hypergeometric P-value and the fold enrichment,
relative to the Down and Up gene sets. In this representation,
miRNAs having the largest inﬂuence on ‘Down’ or ‘Up’ gene set
(green or red circles, respectively) are located in the top right
quadrant of the plot. A possibility is given to highlight the effect
of a speciﬁc miRNA (large square). The interface also provides a
summary table. Functional annotations of the different gene lists can
be accessed through several hyperlinks that show the results of Gene
Ontology enrichment analyses. Additional information provided for
each miRNA corresponds to the expression levels of the transcripts
encoded by the same host gene. Each table can be easily downloaded
for further analysis.

2.2 Database resources

Genes set references are based on Refseq vl4/06/2010. Gene
Ontology annotations are linked to Refseq genes through NCBI
Gene IDs. The set of miRNAs corresponds to release 15 of
Mirbase (Grifﬁths-Jones, 2006). The interface accommodates
several miRNA prediction softwares: Targetscan v5.1 (Lewis
et (11., 2003), MicroCosm Targets v5 (Grifﬁths-Jones et (11., 2008),
Miranda-sept.2008 (Enright et (11., 2003) and PicTar (Krek et (11.,
2005) and exact search of miRNA seeds 2—7, 1—8 and 2—8 into the
3’-UTR and into the CDS of the reference set of genes.

2.3 Example of dataset exploration

Figure 1 summarizes the results of a typical experiment
where miR-34a, miR-34b* and miR-34c-5p were individually
overexpressed into HeLa cells. Expression data have been publicly
deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (reference GSE15957).
Corresponding top tables are also accessible through MiRonTop
web portal. Cut-offs were equal to 8 for the log signal, 0.5 for
the log ratio (miR-34a,b*,c-5p versus controls) and 0 for the odds
ratio. Large variations in the —log(adjusted P-value), which depicts

the signiﬁcance of the enrichment, were noticed for miR-34abc
(large black square) when different zones of the transcripts were
analyzed. From this representation and in agreement with Majoros
and Ohler, the most speciﬁc proﬁles were observed for the regions
of the 3’-UTR adjacent to the stop codon, and, to a lesser extent,
to the polyA tail. Low enrichment was noticed for the CDS and in
the middle of the 3’-UTR. This was consistent with Hafner et (11.
showing that CDS sites were not as functionally active as 3’-UTR
sites (Hafner et (11., 2010). Similar relationships were made for about
10 distinct miRNAs, regardless of the target prediction software that
was used (data not shown).

3 CONCLUSION

MiRonTop is an online application allowing the detection of
miRNAs that signiﬁcantly affect gene expression at a large scale.
The ﬂexibility of the interface allows a ﬁne-tuning of the ‘Down’
and ‘Up’ gene sets according to three parameters that correspond
to the level of expression, the extent of differential expression
and a signiﬁcance index. Such a selection allows experimenters
to easily explore a large-scale experiment and get a summary
report of the different predictions made by several miRNA target
identiﬁcation softwares. Recent investigations on other datasets have
indicated that miRonTop is not only useful in experiments of miRNA
overexpression/knock-down but can also detect more subtle miRNA
activities in a physiological context. In the future, MiRonTop will be
easily updated in order to integrate any additional predictions made
publicly available, such as experimentally validated pairs of miRNA
and mRNA that could now be provided by recent experimental
approaches (Chi et (11., 2009; Hafner et (11., 2010).

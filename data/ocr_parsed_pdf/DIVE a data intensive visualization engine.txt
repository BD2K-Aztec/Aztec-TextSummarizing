ABSTRACT

Summary: Modern scientific investigation is generating increasingly
larger datasets, yet analyzing these data with current tools is challen-
ging. DIVE is a software framework intended to facilitate big data
analysis and reduce the time to scientific insight. Here, we present
features of the framework and demonstrate DIVE’s application to the
Dynameomics project, looking specifically at two proteins.

1 INTRODUCTION

The advent of massive networked computing resources has
enabled Virtually unlimited data collection, storage and analysis
from low-cost genome sequencing, high-precision molecular
dynamics simulations and high-deﬁnition imaging data for radi-
ology, to name just a few examples. This explosion of ‘big data’ is
changing traditional scientiﬁc methods; instead of relying on
experiments to output relatively small targeted datasets, data
mining techniques are being used to analyze data stores with
the intent of learning from the data patterns themselves.
Unfortunately, data analysis and integration in large data stor-
age environments is challenging even for experienced scientists.
Furthermore, most existing domain-speciﬁc tools designed for
complex heterogeneous datasets are not equipped to Visually
analyze big data.

DIVE is a software framework designed for exploring large,
heterogeneous, high-dimensional datasets using a Visual analytics
approach (Supplementary Fig. S1). Visual analytics is a big data
exploration methodology emphasizing the iterative process
between human intuition, computational analyses and Visualiza-
tion. DIVE’s Visual analytics approach integrates with traditional
methods, creating an environment that supports data exploration
and discovery.

2 SYSTEM AND IMPLEMENTATION

DIVE provides a rich ontologically expressive data representation and a
ﬂexible modular streaming-data architecture or pipeline (Supplementary
Fig. S2). It is accessible through an application programming interface,
command line interface or graphical user interface. Applications built on
the DIVE framework inherit features such as a serialization infrastruc-
ture, ubiquitous scripting, integrated multithreading and parallelization,
object-oriented data manipulation and multiple modules for data analysis
and visualization. DIVE can also interoperate with existing analysis tools
to supplement its capabilities, such as the Visualization Toolkit
(Schroeder et al., 1996), Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) and Bing
maps (http://bing.com) by either exporting data into known formats or
by integrating with published software libraries. Furthermore, DIVE can
import compiled software libraries and automatically build native onto-
logical data representations, reducing the need to write DIVE-speciﬁc
software. From a data perspective, DIVE supports the joining of multiple
heterogeneous data sources, creating an object-oriented database capable
of showing inter-domain relationships. And although DIVE currently
focuses on bioinformatics, DIVE itself is data agnostic; data from any
domain may enter the DIVE pipeline.

A core feature of DIVE’s framework is the ﬂexible graph-based data
representation. DIVE data are stored as nodes in a strongly typed onto-
logical network deﬁned by the data. These data can be a simple set of
numbers or a complex object hierarchy with inheritance and well-deﬁned
relationships. Data ﬂow through the system explicitly as a set of data
points passed down the DIVE pipeline or implicitly as information trans-
ferred and transformed through the data relationships (Supplementary
Fig. SSe). A thorough description of the novel technical contributions of
DIVE is provided elsewhere (Rysavy,S.J et al., 2014).

3 RESULTS

The impetus for DIVE was data mining the Dynameomics
dataset (Van der Kamp et al., 2010). Dynameomics is a large
data-intensive project that contains atomistic molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations of the native state and unfolding
pathways of representatives of essentially all protein folds (Van
der Kamp et al., 2010). These protein simulations and associated
biophysical analyses are stored in a mixed data warehouse
(Sims and Daggett, 2012) and ﬁle system environment distrib-
uted over multiple servers containing hundreds of terabytes of
data and >104 times as many structures as the Protein Data Bank
(Bernstein et al., 1977), representing the largest collection of pro-
tein structures and protein simulations in the world.

In the domain of structural biology, Dynameomics exempliﬁes
the challenges of big data. Here, we present DIVE applications
involving two proteins where specialized modules built on the
DIVE framework are used to accelerate biophysical analysis.

The ﬁrst protein is the transcription factor p53, mutations in
which are implicated in cancer. The second protein is human
Cu—Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SODl), mutations in which are
associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Rakhit and
Chakrabartty, 2006).

The Y220C mutation of the p53 DNA binding domain is re-
sponsible for destabilizing the core (J oerger et al., 2006), leading
to ~75 000 new cancer cases annually (Boeckler et al., 2008). We
have used the DIVE framework to analyze the structural and
functional effects of the Y220C mutation through a module
called ContactWalker (Bromley et al., 2013), which identiﬁes
amino acids’ interatomic contacts disrupted significantly as a
result of mutation. The contact pathways between disrupted resi-
dues are identiﬁed using DIVE’s underlying graph-based data
representation.

Figure 1a shows the most disrupted contacts in the Vicinity of
the Y220C mutation. Speciﬁc residues, contacts and simulations
were identiﬁed for more focused analysis. Interesting interatomic
contact data are isolated and then speciﬁc MD time points and
structures are selected for further investigation. For example, see
the contact data mapped onto a structure containing a stabilizing
ligand, which docks closely to many of the disrupted residues,
suggesting a correlation between the mutation-associated effects
and the observed stabilizing effects of the ligand (Fig. 1a).

As another example of the use of DIVE, we have >300 simu-
lations of 106 disease-associated mutants of SOD1 (Schmidlin
et al., 2009). Through extensive studies of A4V mutant SOD1
simulations, Schmidlin et a]. (2009) previously noted the instabil-
ity of two ﬂ-strands in the SOD1 Greek key ﬂ-barrel structure.
However, that analysis took several years to complete and such
manual interrogation of simulations does not scale to allow us to
search for general features linked to disease across hundreds of
simulations. Using DIVE, we were able to further explore the
formation and persistence of the contacts and packing inter-
actions in this region across multiple simulations of mutant
proteins. DIVE facilitates isolation of speciﬁc contacts, rapid
plotting of selected data, easy Visualization of the relevant struc-
tures and geographic locations of speciﬁc mutations, while pro-
viding intuitive navigation from one View to another (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Fig. S1).

The top panel of Figure 1b maps secondary structure for dif-
ferent variants as an example of DIVE’s charting tools. This
chart is quickly generated, contains results for >300 SODl
mutant simulations, is customizable and links to the protein
structure property data (in this case the change in the structure
over time) with a single mouse click (Fig. 1b). These data are in
turn linked to protein structure modules, allowing interactive
Visualization of >60 000 structures from each of the 300 simula-
tions, all streamed from the Structured Query Language (SQL)
data warehouse (Fig. 1b). With DIVE, we simpliﬁed the transi-
tion between high-level protein Views and atomic level details,
facilitating rapid analysis of large amounts of data. DIVE can
also show the context of the detailed results on other levels, such
as worldwide disease incidence (Supplementary Fig. S1).

DIVE’s utility is not limited to protein simulations. To demon-
strate its versatility, usability and data-agnostic nature, we applied
it to additional domains. Brief details of these applications are
provided in Supplementary Information. One example shows an

4 CONCLUSIONS

Overall, DIVE provides an interactive data-exploration frame-
work that expands on conventional analysis paradigms and self-
contained tools. We provided analytic examples in the protein
simulation domain, but the DIVE framework is not limited to
this ﬁeld. DIVE can adapt to existing data representations, con-
sume non-DIVE software libraries and import data from an
array of sources. As research becomes more data-driven and
reliant on data mining and Visualization, big data Visual analytics
solutions should provide a new perspective for scientiﬁc
investigation.

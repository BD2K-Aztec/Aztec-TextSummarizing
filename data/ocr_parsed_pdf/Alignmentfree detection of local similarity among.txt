ABSTRACT

Motivation: Bacterial and viral genomes are often affected by
horizontal gene transfer observable as abrupt switching in local
homology. In addition to the resulting mosaic genome structure,
they frequently contain regions not found in close relatives, which
may play a role in virulence mechanisms. Due to this connection
to medical microbiology, there are numerous methods available to
detect horizontal gene transfer. However, these are usually aimed
at individual genes and viral genomes rather than the much larger
bacterial genomes. Here, we propose an efficient alignment-free
approach to describe the mosaic structure of viral and bacterial
genomes, including their unique regions.

Results: Our method is based on the lengths of exact matches
between pairs of sequences. Long matches indicate close homology,
short matches more distant homology or none at all. These
exact match lengths can be looked up efficiently using an
enhanced suffix array. Our program implementing this approach,
alfy (ALignment-Free local homologY), efficiently and accurately
detects the recombination break points in simulated DNA sequences
and among recombinant HIV-1 strains. We also apply alfy to
Escherichia coli genomes where we detect new evidence for the
hypothesis that strains pathogenic in poultry can infect humans.

1 INTRODUCTION

In contrast to most eukaryotes, viruses and bacteria reproduce
asexually. Nevertheless, their genomes are littered with evidence
of occasional and localized recombination, usually referred to as
‘horizontal gene transfer’. Horizontal gene transfer is observable
as an abrupt change in homology along an alignment of two or
more sequences. The importance of horizontal gene transfer for the
evolution of immune evasion and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic

microbes has been known for decades (Maynard Smith et (11., 199 l).
Correspondingly, there has been and still is a lot of interest in
devising computer programs to automate the detection of mosaic
gene or genome structure (Langille et (11., 2010).

Most of the current methods for annotating mosaic genome
structure are based on alignments and target viral genomes or
individual bacterial genes (Kosakovsky Pond et (11., 2009; Westesson
and Holmes, 2009). These methods are highly accurate but tend
to be too slow for the analysis of whole bacterial genomes.
Recently, Didelot et (11. (2010) expanded their original Monte Carlo
Markov Chain method for inferring recombination rates (Didelot
and Falush, 2007) by also localizing the recombination events
in alignments of whole bacterial genomes. However, even given
such an alignment, the computational burden of their, again, highly
accurate coalescent-based method is considerable.

If speed is of concern, dramatic improvements are possible by
simplifying or eliminating altogether any explicit model under which
inference is made, and in addition by not basing the analysis on a
full multiple sequence alignment. Rozanov et (11. (2004) provide a
web-based genotyping tool for viral genomes hosted by the NCBI.
Their algorithm essentially consists of sliding a window across the
query sequence and blasting the windows against the set of subject
sequences to determine the closest homologs across the query.

An even more radical departure from model- and alignment-
based treatment of mosaic genome structure is the alignment-free
method for HIV typing proposed by Wu et (11. (2007). Alignment-
free methods of sequence comparison tend to be very fast, albeit less
accurate than alignment-based sequence comparison (Reinert et (11.,
2009; Vinga and Almeida, 2003). Best known among the alignment-
free approaches are those based on k-word composition, which is
also what Wu et (11. (2007) have used. Here all substrings of length k
are counted in the two sequences compared and a distance between
the vectors of word counts is deﬁned. Unfortunately, it is difﬁcult to
convert distances between word count vectors to true evolutionary
distances.

We have recently developed two methods that start from the
lengths of exact matches between pairs of sequences and convert
these to substitutions per site (Haubold et (11., 2011, 2009). The
advantage of this approach is that exact match lengths can be looked
up efﬁciently using sufﬁx trees implemented as their more recent
abstractions known as enhanced sufﬁx arrays (Abouelhoda et (11.,
2002) and compressed sufﬁx arrays (Ferragina et (11., 2008).

In this article, we use exact match lengths between a query and
a potentially large set of subject sequences to solve a specialized,

but frequently occurring problem in sequence analysis: at each
position in the query sequence, we wish to determine which subject
sequence—if any—is most closely related to the query. This closest
neighbors problem is common in microbiology and correspondingly
we apply our method to the genomes of HIV and Escherichia coli.

The most prevalent form of HIV is the M group of HIV-1, which
is divided into eight subtypes (A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J) based on the
sequence of their 9 and 10kb genomes. However, recombination
between these subtypes in multiply infected individuals leads to the
emergence of new forms of the virus. Accurate detection of the origin
of individual HIV-l genome segments has clinical implications and
the development of software to automate this procedure has received
corresponding attention (Kosakovsky Pond et (11., 2009).

Closely related strains of bacteria form ‘pan-genomes’ consisting
of a common core and a variable part that is horizontally mobile
(Tettelin et (11., 2005). One example for such a group is E. coli, which
has a genome size ranging from 4.6 to 5.7 MB. This taxon comprises
commensal strains as well as strains that are pathogenic in humans
and homeothermic animals. An important question concerning E. coli
is to what extend strains that are pathogens of live stock might cause
infections in humans (Johnson et (11., 2007).

In the following sections, we ﬁrst describe our alignment-free
method for determining local homology. We test this method
through simulations and then use it to classify HIV-l recombinant
strains and to compare E.c01i genomes. When comparing the
E.c01i genomes, we not only look for switches in local homology
indicative of horizontal gene transfer, but also for regions with no
close homolog among the subject sequences. Investigation of these
‘private’ genomic regions leads us to the detection of new evidence
for the long-held suspicion that animal E.c01i pathogens can also
infect humans (Johnson et (11., 2007).

2 METHODS

Given a query DNA sequence. Q. and a set of subject DNA sequences.
S={S1,...,S,,}. we wish to determine the subject sequences that Q is most
closely related to at every position [7 in Q. For instance. in Figure 1A
Q[l,2] =TA matches S3[l,2] and Q[3,4] matches S2[1,2]. We therefore say
that Q[l,2] is most closely related to S3 and Q[3,4] is most closely related
to S2. In this section. we describe a simpliﬁed version of our algorithm to
locally annotate Q. The algorithm we actually implemented is detailed in
Algorithm $1 of the Supplementary Material.

When comparing Q to a speciﬁc subject. S». we denote by hm, the
length of the shortest preﬁx of the query sufﬁx Q[p,|Q|] that starts at
position [7 and is absent from S. We follow our previous convention
of calling these shortest absent preﬁxes shustrings for SHortest Unique
subSTRINGS (Haubold and Wiehe. 2006; Haubold at (11.. 2005). The
length of the longest shustring starting at Q[p] when compared to all
subject sequences is H],=max15i5,,hi,p. Notice that H1) is bounded by the
query length: Hp: |Q| —p+l. For our example sequences in Figure 1A
h1,1=|T|=l; hm =|T|=l; h3g1=|TAG|=3; and H1 =max{l, 1,3}23.

The set of subject sequences that induce the longest shustring at Q[p] is
Sp 2 {Si 6 Slhm, =H],}. For our example. sequences in Figure 1A S1 2 {S3}.

To determine which segment of Q is most closely related to which subject
sequence. we compute all values of H1) and S,,. This is done by constructing
a generalized sufﬁx tree consisting of the query and all subject sequences
(Fig.1B). We assume that at every branch node v, of this tree we can look up
the length of the concatenated labels along the path from the root to vi. that
is. the string depth of vi. For example. the string depth of V3 in Figure 1B is 2.

This generalized sufﬁx tree is traversed once. and whenever a leaf node
w=(Q,p) is encountered. H1) is computed as one plus the string depth of

the lowest common ancestor node of w and any leaf node referring to a
subject sequence (Fig. 1C). Moreover. Sp is the set of subject sequences in
the subtree rooted on that lowest common ancestor.

Given the table of H1) and SI) values in Figure 1C. we next cover Q with
contiguous intervals of closest neighbors. Such closest neighbors intervals
have the form ([11), rb],S’,h). where 11) and rb are the left and right borders.
S’ =Slb. and h=H”,. The intervals are constructed by traversing the array
H1,H2,...,H1Ql and whenever Hp > H],_1. we do two things:

(1) close the current closest neighbors interval by setting rb <—p — l and
S, (— S»;
(2) open a new closest neighbors interval with 11) <—p and h <—H],.

For our example in Figure 1C. this procedure results in the detection of the
two closest neighbors intervals ([1,2], {S3},3) and ([3,5],{32},3).

Finally. the closest neighbors intervals are summarized into larger regions
of similarity. This is done using a sliding window approach: for each subject
sequence referred to by the closest neighbors intervals within a window. the
shustring lengths are summed and the one or more subject sequences with the
greatest sum are designated the closest neighbors of Q at the given position.

Haubold et a1. (2009) derived the null distribution of shustring lengths
as a function of the number of mismatches between pairs of sequences. In
the limit of 0.75 mismatches per site this corresponds to the distribution of
shustring lengths expected by chance alone. We can therefore also identify
query regions without close homologs among the subject set. Such regions
are characterized as having an average shustring length that is less than the
maximal shustring length expected by chance alone.

2.1 Implementation

The procedure for ﬁnding closest neighbors intervals can easily be
generalized to more than one query sequence and this is the version that we
have implemented. However. when dealing with large datasets the auxiliary
table of H1) and SI) values would impose a substantial memory overhead. So
instead of explicitly constructing this table. we directly build the set of closest

neighbors intervals during sufﬁx tree traversal. This yields a much more
memory efﬁcient implementation. and by keeping the closest neighbors as
an ordered binary tree the concomitant cost in runtime is minimal (Algorithm
S 1).

The ﬁnal program is called alfy for ALignment-Free local homologY and
is written in standard C. The sufﬁx tree was implemented as an enhanced
sufﬁx array (Abouelhoda et (11.. 2002) using the sufﬁx array library distributed
by Manzini and Ferragina (2002).

2.2 Runtime analysis

alfy determines closest homologs in three phases: it begins by constructing
an enhanced sufﬁx array of all m query and n subject sequences. This array
is then traversed to compute the list of closest neighbors intervals. Finally.
the list of closest neighbors intervals is subjected to sliding window analysis
to produce the desired annotation of the query. Sufﬁx array construction for
m query and n subject sequences of length L ideally takes time 0((m+n)L).
Insertion of a single interval node in an interval tree takes 0(logL); the
construction of one tree per query sequence thus takes a total of 0(leogL)
time. Traversal of m interval trees takes time 0(mL). Therefore. the whole
procedure takes time O((m+n)L+leogL+mL). Notice that if a single
query is compared to a large number of subjects. that is. m = 1 and n >>logL.
the run time approaches 0(nL).

2.3 Phylogeny reconstruction

Pairwise substitution rates were estimated from whole Ecoli genomes
using the program kr (Domazet-Loso and Haubold. 2009). The substitution
rates were clustered using the neighbor joining algorithm implemented in
the program neighbor. which is part of the software package PHYLIP
(Felsenstein. 1989). Trees were midpoint-rooted using retree and drawn using
drawgram. which are also part of PHYLIP.

3 RESULTS

In the following sections, we ﬁrst apply alfy to simulated and then to
empirical data to explore the efﬁciency and accuracy of the program.

3.1 Runtime and memory consumption

We simulated sequence samples consisting of one query and
10 or 100 subject sequences with 0.13 or 0.006 segregating
sites/nucleotide, respectively, between the query and its closest
neighbor using the program Dawg (Cartwright, 2005). Figure 2A
shows the runtime on a single AMD Opteron 2.3 GHz processor as
a ﬁinction of sequence length. The runtime grows approximately
linearly in the sample size and the sequence length, as expected
from the analysis in Section 2.2. Similarly, the memory requirement
is linear in the amount of sequence data, as expected for a sufﬁx
array-based procedure (Fig. 2B).

3.2 Accuracy of homology detection

To test the accuracy of local homology detection by alfy, we
simulated samples of three pure subject sequences and one
recombinant query again using Dawg (Cartwright, 2005). As shown
in Figure 3, this was done by generating sequences with distance
2s between Q and S1 or between Q and S2. Five such segments
were generated, each segment evolving either along genealogy G1
or along genealogy G2.

Detection accuracy was scored as the fraction of nucleotides
correctly assigned to S1 or S2. For segments of length 2kb, the
detection accuracy increased with distance up to s80.05, while it

3.3 Application to genome data

We applied our homology detection method to viral and bacterial
genomes in order to solve two common tasks: genotyping of
circulating recombinant forms of HIV-1, and detection of horizontal
gene transfer and unique segments among E.c01i genomes.

3.3.] Detection of circulating recombinant forms of HIV-1 We
started the analysis by comparing alfy to two fast HIV-l-subtyping
tools: the NCBI genotyping tool (Rozanov et a1., 2004), and
the k-word-based clustering method by Wu et a1. (2007). These
programs and alfy were applied to two published HIV-1 datasets
using the approach outlined by Wu et a1. (2007), who considered
the top two closest sequences as valid annotations. The ﬁrst
dataset consisted of 91 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs, query)
compared to 42 pure subtype strains (subject) (Leitner et a1., 2005;
Wu et a1., 2007). The accuracy of alfy was 93.4%, while Wu et a1.
(2007) reported the accuracy of the NCBI tool as 73.4%, and that
of their own tool as 87.3%. The window size for alfy was 300, the
same as that used in the NCBI tool.

Fig. 5. HIV-1 strain A_DQ083238 is an A/C recombinant. The position of
the material transferred from a C strain is shown in dark gray as diagnosed
by SCUEAL (top) and alfy (bottom). alfy was run with window size 300 bp.

The second dataset consisted of a query set of 266 HIV-1 CRFs
compared to a subject set consisting of 42 pure subtype strains and
65 recombinant strains of known subtype (Leitner et a1., 2005; Wu
et a1., 2007). Here, alfy subtyped 263 strains correctly, the NCBI
tool 264 and Wu et a1. (2007) annotated 242 strains correctly.

In addition to these two fast typing methods, we compared
alfy to SCUEAL. This is a phylogeny-based HIV-1 subtyping
software that relies on a genetic algorithm to pick the most likely
recombinant pattern given a query sequence and an alignment of
subject sequences (Kosakovsky Pond et a1., 2009). Its authors report
that it detects < 1% false positives on simulated data and we used
it to type a single HIV-1 strain (A_DQ083238) against our standard
42 pure strains. This query was originally annotated as a pure A
strain, but we have previously noted that it is an A/C recombinant
(Domazet-Loso and Haubold, 2009). Correspondingly, SCUEAL
and alfy report the transfer of two large C fragments amounting
to 24.3% (SCUEAL) and 25.1% (alfy) of the genome (Fig. 5). The
location of the two C-segments determined by SCUEAL (Fig. 5,
top) is similar to the annotation by alfy (Fig. 5, bottom).

We also used the comparison between strain A_QD083238 and
the 42 reference strains to benchmark the resource requirements
of alfy, the NCBI tool, the Wu et a1. (2007) tool and SCUEAL.
Table 1 shows that alfy took 0.4 s for this analysis. Unfortunately,
the timing of the NCBI tool is not straight forward since this is only
available as a web service. To get arough estimate, we repeatedly ran
BLAST with a 300 bp query taken from the query strain against the
42 reference strains. 97 such calls would cover the query in 100 bp
steps and this took 1.4 s, which is presumably an upper bound on the
true runtime. The Java program by Wu et a1. (2007) took 3.5 min,
while SCUEAL took 6.9 h.

As to memory requirements, BLAST used much less memory than
alfy (2.2 KB versus 9 MB; Table 1). This is expected for a method
that indexes the short query (BLAST) as opposed to indexing the
long subject (alfy). Wu et a1. (2007) required the most memory
(2.2 GB), while SCUEAL still used over 17 times more memory
than alfy (160 MB).

3.3.2 Investigating genomes of pathogenic E.c01i To test the
hypothesis that E.c01i strains pathogenic in birds might also infect
humans, Johnson et a1. (2007) sequenced a strain of avian pathogenic
E.c01i (APEC_Ol) and compared it to the genomes of four fully
sequenced E.c01i strains, three of which cause urinary tract infection
in humans (Fig. 6). Consistent with their hypothesis, they found that
APEC_Ol is very similar to the human uropathogenic strain UTI89.

Figure 7 shows the comparison between APEC_Ol as query and
the remaining four E.c01i strains as subject using alfy with a window

size of 1 kb. This analysis of the 25.0 MB of sequence data required
85 s runtime and 961 MB of memory on our reference machine. As
expected, a high proportion (90.5%) of the APEC_01 genome is
most similar to its closest relative, UTI89. However, like Johnson
et a1. (2007) we found that between positions 4.71 and 4.76 MB,
there is a 48 kb region that has been horizontally transferred from
a strain like CFT073 (Fig. 7, arrow). Johnson et a1. (2007) also
observed that 4.5% of APEC_01 open reading frames (ORFs) had
no homolog among the other E.c01i strains investigated, that is, these
ORFs were private to APEC_01. This is similar to our estimate of
3.0% private nucleotides in that strain.

The number of frilly sequenced E.c01i strains contained in RefSeq
has grown to 29 since the study by Johnson et a1. (2007). Figure 8
shows the phylogeny of these strains with the ﬁve taxa investigated
by Johnson et a1. (2007) (Fig. 6) marked in bold. The analysis of
the 151.8 MB that make up these genomes plus APEC_01 took alfy
744 s and occupied 5.8 GB of memory.

The private fraction of the genome shrank from 3.0% to 0.7%
and Table 2 shows the 10 unique regions of length 1000 bp or
greater that we identiﬁed. The longest private region was located
between 2 190 501 and 2 196 650. We used megablast to compare

these 6150 bp against the full nucleotide database (nr) and found a
single hit that spanned the entire query. This hit comprised part of the
gene cluster that speciﬁes the Ol-antigen of E.c01i serogroup 01. It
is ﬁled under Accession GU299791 and was recently sequenced
from E.c01i strain G1632 that was isolated from a patient with
urinary tract infection (Li et a1., 2010). An optimal local alignment
between all 10 301 bp of the Ol-antigen gene cluster and the genome
of APEC_01 resulted in an alignment comprising 10 300bp with
11 mismatches and 3 single nucleotide indels. This high similarity
between the Ol-antigen region of a clinical isolate and an avian
pathogenic E.c01i is strong additional evidence that avian pathogenic
E.c01i can cause urinary tract infections in humans.

capabilities of the instruments used to gather the data in the ﬁrst
place. In the realm of sequence analysis, the ﬁrst big advance
came through optimal inexact matching methods (Needleman and
Wunsch, 1970; Smith and Waterman, 1981). By combining fast exact
matching with the inherently slower inexact matching techniques,
fast programs like BLAST and its descendants were created
(Altschul and Lipman, 1990). In this article, we take this expansion
of the role of exact matching in sequence comparison to its logical
conclusion by eliminating the inexact matching phase altogether
when looking for close local homologs of a query sequence among
a set of subject sequences. The result is not a substitute for residue-
by-residue alignment but a guide to where this level of detail might
be applied most proﬁtably.

We based our program on the enhanced sufﬁx array library by
Manzini and Ferragina (2002) because it is known to be one of the
most efﬁcient implementations available (Puglisi et a1., 2007). As a
result, enhanced sufﬁx array construction in alfy remains fast even
when analyzing sets of closely related bacterial genomes (Fig. 8).
Such run time behavior is not guaranteed, as in the limit of sorting
very long identical sufﬁxes the library regresses to its worst case run
time, which is quadratic in the number of characters. However, in
our experience this has not been a problem in any of our applications
ranging from HIV-1 genomes and near-identical E.c01i genomes
in this article to the complete genomes of 12 Drosophila species
(Domazet-Loso and Haubold, 2009).

In software based on sufﬁx arrays, the time-consuming
construction of the enhanced sufﬁx array is often kept separate
from its quick traversal. This makes it possible to apply the
traversal to a pre-computed index. However, in alfy we regard
each run as a one-off analysis during which the enhanced sufﬁx
array is computed on the ﬂy. An implementation based on
pre-computed sufﬁx arrays would, of course, be much faster.
For example, 80% of the time taken to compare APEC_Ol
to 29 E.c01i genomes is used for the construction of the
enhanced sufﬁx array. Given a pre-computed enhanced sufﬁx
array, the runtime of alfy could therefore be reduced up to
5-fold. More important than the exact runtime details of our
particular implementation are therefore the program’s general
properties: for a single query, both its run time and its memory
requirement scale linearly with the size of simulated subject sets
(Fig. 2).

Our simulations in Figure 4 show that such algorithmically
minimal utilization of time and memory is sufﬁcient to obtain
reasonably accurate detection of closest neighbors as long as the
number of mutations in the sample is not too small or greater
than ~0.2 substitutions per site between the query and its closest
neighbor. Another requirement for accuracy is that the window size
does not exceed the size of the shortest recombinant segment one
wishes to detect. Otherwise, the annotation process is hampered by
averaging shustring lengths over two or more regions of distinct
ancestry. This consideration determined our choice of window size.
In the case of HIV, 300bp windows are also used by the NCBI
genotyping tool. In the case of E.c01i, we were interested in transfer
events spanning at least 1 kb, hence the window size of 1 kb for that
analysis.

Given these restrictions, alfy could classify recombinant group M
HIV-1 strains as reliably as the NCBI tool (Rozanov et a1., 2004)
and the program by Wu et a1. (2007). It is certainly possible to
achieve greater accuracy as shown by the phylogeny-based tool
SCUEAL (Kosakovsky Pond et a1., 2009), albeit at the cost of
escalating the runtime from 0.4 s to 6.9 h for the analysis of a single
HIV-1 genome. While such extensive runtime requirements may be
acceptable in patient care, it makes SCUEAL difﬁcult to apply to
the over 500 times larger genomes of bacteria like E.c01i.

In our comparison between the avian pathogen APEC_Ol and
other E.c01i strains we ﬁrst replicated the analysis by Johnson
et a1. (2007). This showed that APEC_Ol is most closely related
to strain UTI86, which causes urinary tract infections in humans
(Figs 6 and 7). Spliced into this ‘clonal frame’ (Milkrnan and
McKane Bridges, 1990) are regions horizontally transferred from
other E.c01i strains, most notably the 48 kb or more obtained from
a strain similar to CFT073, another human pathogen (Fig. 7).

Johnson et a1. (2007) speculated that the APEC_01-speciﬁc
regions they found might be particularly helpful when searching
for a link to human disease. We therefore compared APEC_Ol to
the 29 E.c01i genomes currently available (Fig. 8) and found that the
longest private region is part of the gene cluster specifying the 01
serotype of APEC_Ol . Fortuitously, the entire 10 kb covering the 01
region had just been sequenced in a clinical isolate (Li et a1., 2010)
resulting in a match to the corresponding region in APEC_Ol with
only one mismatch per kilobase. Since APEC_Ol infects chickens
(Johnson et a1., 2007), this is ﬁirther evidence that E.c01i pathogens
of poultry can infect humans.

The near identity of the O-antigen cluster in APEC_Ol and a
clinical isolate could have been discovered by simply blasting the
newly sequenced Ol antigen cluster against GenBank. However,
our approach to study the regions private to APEC_Ol was the
one suggested without the beneﬁt of hindsight (Johnson et a1.,
2007). Moreover, alfy directly identiﬁes regions without strong
homology, which makes it a convenient tool for this kind of
analysis.

Abstract

Motivation: Despite ongoing cancer research, available therapies are still limited in quantity and
effectiveness, and making treatment decisions for individual patients remains a hard problem.
Established subtypes, which help guide these decisions, are mainly based on individual data types.
However, the analysis of multidimensional patient data involving the measurements of various
molecular features could reveal intrinsic characteristics ofthe tumor. Large—scale projects accumu—
late this kind of data for various cancer types, but we still lack the computational methods to
reliably integrate this information in a meaningful manner. Therefore, we apply and extend current
multiple kernel learning for dimensionality reduction approaches. On the one hand, we add a regu—
larization term to avoid overfitting during the optimization procedure, and on the other hand, we
show that one can even use several kernels per data type and thereby alleviate the user from hav—
ing to choose the best kernel functions and kernel parameters for each data type beforehand.
Results: We have identified biologically meaningful subgroups for five different cancer types.
Survival analysis has revealed significant differences between the survival times of the identified
subtypes, with Pvalues comparable or even better than state—of—the—art methods. Moreover, our re—
sulting subtypes reflect combined patterns from the different data sources, and we demonstrate
that input kernel matrices with only little information have less impact on the integrated kernel ma—
trix. Our subtypes show different responses to specific therapies, which could eventually assist in
treatment decision making.

1 Introduction

Cancer is not only a very aggressive but also a very diverse disease.
Therefore, a number of approaches aim to identify subtypes of can-
cer in a specific tissue, where subtypes refer to groups of patients
with corresponding biological features or a correlation in a clinical
outcome, e.g. survival time or response to treatment. Nowadays,
most of these methods utilize single data types (e.g. gene expres-
sion). However, subtypes that are merely based on information from
one level can hardly capture the subtleties of a tumor. Therefore,
huge efforts are made to improve the comprehensive understanding
of tumorigenesis in the different tissue types. Large-scale projects,
e.g. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (The Cancer Genome Atlas,
2008), provide a massive amount of data generated by diverse

platforms such as gene expression, DNA methylation and copy
number data for various cancer types. Still, we require computa-
tional methods that enable the comprehensive analysis of these
multidimensional data and the reliable integration of information
generated from different sources.

One simple and frequently applied method to combine biological
data consists of clustering the samples using each data type separ-
ately and subsequently integrating the different cluster assignments.
The latter step can be performed either manually or automatically,
e.g. using consensus clustering (Monti et (11., 2003). Manual integra-
tion tends to be biased, leading to inconsistent results. However,
both manual and automatic integration cannot capture correlated
information between the data types because low signals might

already vanish during the initial clustering. Therefore, more
advanced approaches bring forward the step of data integration to
make use of weak but concordant structures in different data sour—
ces. Shen et al. (2009, 2012) introduced iCluster, which allows for
data integration and dimensionality reduction at the same time. The
basis is a Gaussian latent variable model with regularization for
sparsity, in which the cluster assignment can be derived from the la—
tent variable vector. Because of the high computational complexity
of this approach, preselection of the features is necessary, so the
clustering result strongly depends on this preprocessing step. An ap—
proach that tackles both the problem of how to use correlation
between the data types and the problem of feature preselection is
Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) (Wang et al., 2014). First, a simi—
larity network of the samples is constructed from each input data
type. These networks are then fused into one combined similarity
network using an iterative approach based on message passing. This
way, the networks are updated in each iteration such that they be—
come more similar to each other, until the process converges. The re—
sulting network is then clustered by Spectral Clustering (von
Luxburg, 2007). An approach that uses the same clustering algo—
rithm is Afﬁnity Aggregation for Spectral Clustering (Huang et al.,
2012). Here, the main idea is to extend Spectral Clustering to allow
for several affinity matrices as input. The matrices are fused using a
linear combination, with weights being optimized using multiple
kernel learning.

2 Approach

We propose to apply and extend multiple kernel learning for data in—
tegration and subsequently perform cancer subtype identification.
To this end, we adopt the multiple kernel learning for dimensional—
ity reduction (MKL—DR) framework (Lin et al., 2011) that enables
dimensionality reduction and data integration at the same time. This
way, the samples are projected into a lower dimensional, integrated
subspace where they can be analyzed further. We show that this rep—
resentation captures useful information that can be used for cluster—
ing samples, but other follow—up analyses are also possible from this
data representation. Compared to previous approaches, this proced—
ure offers several advantages: The framework provides high flexibil—
ity concerning the choice of the dimensionality reduction method,
i.e. not only unsupervised but also supervised and semi—supervised
methods can be adopted. Furthermore, the framework provides high
flexibility concerning the input data type, i.e. since the first step is a
kernelization of the input matrices, these can be of various formats,
such as sequences or numerical matrices. Moreover, in case one does
not have enough information from which to choose the best kernel
function for a data type or the best parameter combination for a
given kernel beforehand, it is possible to input several kernel
matrices per data type, based on different kernel functions or param—
eter settings. The multiple kernel learning approach will auto—
matically upweight the matrices with high information content
while downweighting those with low information content. To avoid
overfitting, especially in the scenario with many distinct input matri—
ces, we extend the MKL—DR approach by adding a regularization
term.

We use five different cancer sets for the evaluation of our
method. The resulting clusterings reflect characteristics from distinct
input data types and reveal differences between the clusters concern—
ing their response to specific treatments. Furthermore, we show that
kernel matrices with less information have less influence on the final
result. A comparison of the P values for survival differences between

our clusters and the SNF clusters shows that our method yields com—
parable results while offering a lot more flexibility.

3 Methods

To integrate several data types, we utilize multiple kernel learning,
extending the MKL—DR approach (Lin et al., 2011). This method is
based, on the one hand, on multiple kernel learning, and, on the
other hand, on the graph embedding framework for dimensionality
reduction. We add a constraint that leads to the regularization of the
vector controlling the kernel combinations, which, to our know—
ledge, is the first time this has been done for unsupervised multiple
kernel learning. We call this method regularized multiple kernel
learning for dimensionality reduction (rMKL—DR) in the following
discussion.

3.1 Multiple kernel learning

In general, multiple kernel learning optimizes the weights [3 that lin—
early combine a set of input kernel matrices {K1, . . . .KM} to gener—
ate a unified kernel matrix K, such that

M
K = Zﬁme. ﬁmzo. (1)
m:1

Here, each input data type is represented as an individual kernel
matrix. Therefore, this approach can be used for data having differ—
ent feature representations.

3.2 Graph embedding

MKL—DR is described upon the graph embedding framework for
dimensionality reduction (Yan et al., 2007), which enables the in—
corporation of a large number of dimensionality reduction methods.
In this framework, the projection vector U (for the projection into a
one—dimensional subspace) or the projection matrix V (for the pro—
jection into higher dimensions) is optimized based on the graph—pre—
serving criterion:

N
minimize Z ()vTxi — Uijszi; (2)

N
subject to Z HUTxiHZa’ii : const.. or (3)
i:1
N
Z )jUTx,‘ — £99112ng : const. (4)
i./':1

with U being the projection vector, W a similarity matrix with entries
w,, and D (or W’) a constraint matrix to avoid the trivial solution.
The choice of the matrices W and D (or W and W’) determines the
dimensionality reduction scheme to be implemented. It also depends
on this scheme whether the first or the second constraint is used. In
the following, we will focus on the optimization problem with
Constraint (3), but the constructions are analogous when using
Constraint (4).

3.3 Multiple kernel learning for dimensionality
reduction

The kernelized version of the constrained optimization problem (2)
can be derived using an implicit feature mapping of the data to a
high—dimensional Hilbert space (1) : x,- —> d)(x,-). Additionally, it can
be shown that the optimal projection vector U lies in the span of the

data points x,, thus U : 221:1 and)(xn). Together with the kernel
function K(x. x’) : (d)(x). d)(x’)) and Formula (1), this yields the fol—
lowing optimization problem:

Since we are applying several kernels and want to avoid overfit—
ting, we add the constraint HﬂHl : 1. Had we added the constraint
H13) )1 31, this would amount to an Ivanov regularization. The corres—
ponding Tikhonov regularization would be to directly add the regu—
larization term A)  )1 to the minimization problem. The full
optimization problem for rMKL—DR is then:

The optimization problem can easily be extended to the projec—
tion into more than one dimension. In that case, a projection matrix
A: [an - - - up] is optimized instead of the single projection vector or.
Then, A is optimized at the same time as the kernel weight vector If
according to a chosen dimensionality reduction method. Since the
simultaneous optimization of these two variables is difficult, coord—
inate descent is employed, i.e. A and If are iteratively optimized in
an alternating manner until convergence or a maximum number of
iterations is reached. One can start either with the optimization of
A, then [f is initialized to equal weights for all kernel matrices sum—
ming up to one or with the optimization of If, then AAT is initialized
to I.

Using this framework, we apply the dimensionality reduction al—
gorithm Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) (He and Niyogi,
2004). This is an unsupervised local method that aims to conserve
the distances of each sample to its k nearest neighbors. The neigh—
borhood of a data point i is denoted as  For LPP, the matrices
W and D are then defined as

{1, if ieNi(/)v/ EMU)
w”:

0. else

ZN w... if i=/
0),: n:1 (16>

0. else.

The rMKL—DR approach with LPP will be called rMKL—LPP
from now on. The clustering process is performed using k—means.
For the evaluation of the clusterings, we use the silhouette width
(Rousseeuw, 1987), a measure that indicates, for each data point,
how well it fits into its own cluster, compared to how well it would
fit into the best other cluster. When averaged over all data points,
the resulting mean silhouette value gives a hint on how coherent a
clustering is and how well the clusters are separated.

The running time of the whole algorithm can be separated into the
dimensionality reduction step and the k—means clustering. The dimen—
sionality reduction is performed by iteratively updating the projection
matrix A and the kernel weight vector If. The optimization of If uses
semidefinite programming where the number of constraints is linear
in the number of input kernel matrices and the number of variables is
quadratic in the number of input kernel matrices. However, if
M < N, the bottleneck is the optimization of A. This involves solving
a generalized eigenvalue problem that has a complexity of 0(n3).

3.4 Leave—one—out cross—validation

To assess the stability of the resulting clusterings, we applied a
leave—one—out cross—validation approach, i.e. we apply the pipeline
consisting of dimensionality reduction and subsequent clustering to
a reduced dataset that does not include patient i. The projection of
the left—out sample can be calculated using proj(xi) :ATICiﬂ 6 RP,
and this patient is assigned to the cluster with the closest group
mean in the dimensionality reduced space. Finally, we compare this
leave—one—out clustering to the clustering of the full dataset using the
Rand index (Rand, 1971).

3.5 Materials

We used data from five different cancer types from TCGA (The
Cancer Genome Atlas, 2008), preprocessed and provided by Wang
et al. (2014). The cancer types comprise glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) with 213 samples, breast invasive carcinoma (BIC) with 105
samples, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KRCCC) with 122 sam—
ples, lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) with 106 samples and
colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) with 92 samples. For each cancer
type, we used gene expression, DNA methylation and miRNA ex—
pression data in the clustering process. For the survival analysis, we
used the same quantities as were used in Wang et al. (2014), this
means, we used the number of days to the last follow—up, where
available. For COAD, these were combined with the number of days
to last known alive because of many missing values in the number of
days to the last follow—up data.

4 Results and discussion

We applied rMKL—LPP to five cancer datasets. For each dataset, we
ran the algorithm with both possible initializations, either starting
with the optimization of A or with the optimization of If. For both
dimensionality reduction results, the integrated data points were
then clustered using k—means with k E {2. .... 15}. We chose the opti—
mal number of clusters using the average silhouette value of the clus—
tering result. This criterion was then also utilized to select the best
clustering among the two different initializations. In most cases, ini—
tializing If led to slightly better silhouette values, although the final
results for both initializations were highly similar concerning the
number of identified clusters and the cluster assignment.

We can observe that Cluster 1 is strongly enriched for the mesen-
chymal subtype, whereas Cluster 2 contains mainly samples that be-
long to the classical and the neural subtype. Samples of the
proneural subtype are mainly distributed over Cluster 3 and Cluster
4, where these two clusters also reflect the G-CIMP status. While
Cluster 3 consists almost only of G-CIMP positive samples, Cluster
4 contains samples that belong to the proneural subtype but are G-
CIMP negative. This shows that in this scenario, evaluating expres-
sion and DNA methylation data together can be very beneficial since
an analysis based on gene expression data alone would have prob-
ably led to a union of Cluster 3 and Cluster 4.

4.5 Clinical implications from clusterings

To gain further insights into the biological consequences of the iden-
tified clusters, we have investigated how patients of the individual
clusters respond to different treatments. Of the 213 glioblastoma

patients, 94 were treated with Temozolomide, an alkylating agent
which leads to thymine mispairing during DNA replication (Patel
et al., 2014). Figure 5 shows for each cluster the survival time of pa-
tients treated versus those not treated with this drug. We can see
that this treatment was effective only in a subset of the identified
groups. Patients belonging to Cluster 5 had a significantly increased
survival time when treated with Temozolomide (P value after
Bonferroni correction < 0.01). For Cluster 1 and Cluster 2, we can
see a weaker tendency of treated patients living longer than un-
treated ones (P value after Bonferroni correction < 0.05), whereas
for the other clusters, we did not detect significant differences in sur-
vival time between treated and untreated patients after correcting
for multiple testing. Survival analysis for other medications could
show their effectiveness in different groups.

Cluster 3 consists mainly of patients belonging to the proneural
expression subtype and the G-CIMP methylation subtype. Patients

from this cluster show in general an increased survival time;
however, they do not benefit significantly from the treatment with
Temozolomide. We have determined differentially expressed
genes between these patients and all other patients using the
Kruskal—Wallis rank sum test. Table 3 (column 1) shows the top
15 terms of a Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the set of
overexpressed genes. The results are very similar to those found by
Noushmehr et al. (2010) for their identified G—CIMP positive
subtype. In addition, we found the set of underexpressed genes to
be highly enriched for processes associated to the immune sys—
tem and inflammation [cf. Table 3 (column 2)]. Since chronic in—
flammation is generally related to cancer progression and is thought
to play an important role in the construction of the tumor micro—
environment (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011), these downregula—
tions might be a reason for the favorable outcome of patients from
this cluster.

5 Conclusion

Because of the large amount of different biological measurements, it
is now possible to study diseases on many different levels such as
comparing differences in DNA methylation, gene expression or copy
number variation. For the unsupervised analysis of samples to detect
interesting subgroups, it is not in general clear how to weight the im—
portance of the different types of information. In this work, we have
proposed to use unsupervised multiple kernel learning in this setting.
For patient data from five different cancers, we have shown that our
approach can find subgroups that are more interesting according to
the log—rank test than are the ones found by state—of—the—art meth—
ods. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that we can even utilize

several kernel matrices per data type, not only to improve perform—
ance but also to remove the burden of selecting the optimal kernel
matrix from the practitioner. The visualizations of the contributions
of the individual kernels suggest that using more than one kernel
matrix per data type can even be beneficial, and the stability analysis
shows that the method does not overfit when more kernels are
added. In contrast to the unregularized MKL—DR, rMKL—DR re—
mains stable also for small datasets. For a wide applicability of the
method, this is especially important, since in many potential applica—
tion scenarios the number of available samples is smaller than in this
study. Furthermore, as we used the graph embedding framework, it
is straightforward to perform semi—supervised learning (e.g. use the
treatment data as labels where available and evaluate how unlabeled
data points distribute over the different clusters). The clustering of
GBM patients displayed concordance to previous clusterings based
on expression as well as on DNA methylation data, which shows
that our approach is able to capture this diverse information within
one clustering. For the same clustering, we also analyzed the re—
sponse of the patients to the drug Temozolomide, revealing that pa—
tients belonging to specific clusters significantly benefit from this
therapy while others do not. The G0 enrichments for the interesting
clusters of the GBM patient samples showed, on the one hand, simi—
lar results to what was known from the biological literature and, on
the other hand, down—regulation of the immune system in the sub—
group of cancer patients who survived longer. This suggests that
down—regulation of parts of the immune system could be beneficial
in some scenarios. Further follow—up studies on the results of the dif—
ferent clusterings are necessary to assess their biological significance
and implications.

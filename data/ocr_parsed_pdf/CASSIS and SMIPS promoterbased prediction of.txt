Abstract

Motivation: Secondary metabolites (SM) are structurally diverse natural products of high pharma—
ceutical importance. Genes involved in their biosynthesis are often organized in clusters, i.e., are
co—Iocalized and co—expressed. In silico cluster prediction in eukaryotic genomes remains problem—
atic mainly due to the high variability of the clusters’ content and lack of other distinguishing
sequence features.

Results: We present Cluster Assignment by Islands of Sites (CASSIS), a method for SM cluster pre—
diction in eukaryotic genomes, and Secondary Metabolites by InterProScan (SMIPS), a tool for gen—
ome—wide detection of SM key enzymes (’anchor’ genes): polyketide synthases, non—ribosomal
peptide synthetases and dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases. Unlike other tools based on protein
similarity, CASSIS exploits the idea of co—regulation ofthe cluster genes, which assumes the exist—
ence of common regulatory patterns in the cluster promoters. The method searches for ’islands’ of
enriched cluster—specific motifs in the vicinity of anchor genes. It was validated in a series of cross—
validation experiments and showed high sensitivity and specificity.

1 Introduction

 

Secondary metabolites (SM), also often referred as natural prod-
ucts, are substances with outstanding diversity of biological activ-
ities, including pharmaceutically important ones, e.g. antibiotic,
toxic, immunosuppressant. They are produced primarily by micro-
organisms (fungi, bacteria, algae). Genes responsible for SM bio-
synthesis and also for modifications, transport, regulation, etc., are
often organized in clusters (Brakhage and Schroeckh, 2011). Here,
we define clusters as sets of co-localized and co-regulated genes,
the products of which are presumably functionally connected.
In fungi, SM clusters typically have modest sizes (normally up to

(C7 The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

20 genes), are characterized by tight co-localization of successive
genes and are often regulated by a cluster-specific transcription
factor (csTF), which can be a part of the respective cluster
(Brakhage, 2013; Keller and Hohn, 1997). In many cases, also not
csTF can regulate SM clusters (Hoffmeister and Keller, 2007).
Recently, an example of cross-cluster regulation was described in
fungi: activation of the csTF of a cluster led to upregulation of an-
other cluster on a different chromosome; in addition to the own
cluster (Bergmann et (11., 2010). In this example, elucidation of the
cluster specific motif helped to understand the mode of regulation
of the second cluster.

CASSIS and SMIPS

Two SM classes of particular importance are synthesized by
multimodular megasynthases: polyketide synthases (PKS) and non—
ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) or PKS—NRPS hybrids. In
eukaryotes, in particular in fungi, these enzymes are characterized
by specific multidomain structure and large size, which makes them
easy to detect in the genomes. The other cluster members, however,
are more difficult to identify since the clusters” content varies greatly
and there are no stable cluster markers (i.e. genes that would always
accompany a megasynthase). This constitutes the first challenge for
computational prediction of clusters.

The second challenge is the scarcity of the experimental data.
The main body of experimental evidence for SMs and their biosyn—
thetic pathways comes from bacteria and is not always applicable to
eukaryotes. For instance, amino acid specificity of adenylation do—
mains is quite well predictable from NRPS structure (Eppelmann
et al., 2002; Stachelhaus et al., 1999) in bacteria but the same mod—
els do not work for fungi (Boettger et al., 2012). Fungal data are ra—
ther scanty, in total <40 clusters are fully described so far (collected
in this study, see Supplementary Table 51 ).

Most cluster prediction tools developed heretofore depend on
domain homology, e.g. antiSMASH (Blin et al., 2013), SMURF
(Khaldi et al., 2010), CLUSEAN (Weber et al., 2009) or ClustScan
(Starcevic et 41., 2008). These tools rely on collections of protein do—
mains found in known clusters and predict new clusters by searching
for these domains. This approach works well for similar clusters but
has difficulties when encountering new cluster members (i.e. the pro—
teins with new functions, with domains unknown to the system).
Besides, it is known that not all successive genes in a cluster region
belong to the cluster, e.g. at least four genes within the aflatoxin
cluster are ‘gap” genes that are not conserved and not assigned to the
aflatoxin or sterigmatocystin biosynthesis (Amaike and Keller,
2011). Consideration of domains of the gap genes leads to erroneous
predictions. All these problems together with the limited number of
eukaryotic ‘template’ clusters make similarity—based methods error—
prone and tending to overestimate the clusters” lengths, when
applied to eukaryotes. Homology limitations might be bypassed by
applying other approaches, such as window—averaged DNA curva—
ture profiles (Do and Miyano, 2008) or methods relying on expres—
sion data, like microarrays, etc. (Andersen et 41., 2013). But these
methods are limited in their applications. The former is restricted to
LaeA—like regulated clusters, the latter require expression data,
which can be problematic because most fungal clusters are silent
under laboratory conditions (Brakhage and Schroeckh, 2011) and
their induction is a challenging task.

Of all existing cluster predicting tools, antiSMASH is the most
prominent, reliable and very much recommendable to use.
Nonetheless, there is one type of useful information that is ignored
by the similarity approach that is utilized by antiSMASH: the infor—
mation about common TF binding sites that characterize the clus—
ters. Since the cluster genes are co—regulated, their promoters should
share the transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) for the common
regulator. Taking into account this additional layer of information
can improve the cluster prediction and supply with additional useful
characteristics, such as the shared regulatory pattern and the nature
of the regulating csTF.

Recently, we suggested an approach to detect eukaryotic gene
clusters by estimating the density of binding motifs for csTF. The
density must be higher within the clusters and lower, although not
completely abolished, in other parts of the genome. The method,
and the tool based on the method, is called Motif Density Method
(MDM, Wolf et al., 2013). MDM showed high specificity and sensi—
tivity and was able to solve difficult problems like distinguishing

closely located clusters (separated by just several genes), the task un—
solvable for similarity—based tools (Wolf et al., 2013). After having
solved the main problem—the usage of promoter information for
cluster prediction—we wanted to improve the method making the
algorithm more transparent and the tool easier to handle.

Here, we present ‘Cluster Assignment by Islands of Sites”
(CASSIS), the further development and improvement of MDM. We
made several changes, most importantly in the prediction algorithm,
which are described in detail in the ‘Methods” section. In short, in—
stead of estimating the motifs” density in a sliding window, we
applied a set of rules to identify the borders of the motif ‘islands”
around the anchor gene. The introduced changes improved the per—
formance and made the algorithm simpler and more straightfor—
ward. The CASSIS method is implemented in a tool with the same
name. An online version as well as downloads for Windows and
Linux is available. Besides, we added a small tool called ‘Secondary
Metabolites by InterProScan” (SMIPS) for the fast and easy genome—
wide detection of SM anchor genes, e.g. PKS, NRPS and dimethy—
lallyl tryptophan synthases (DMATS). SMIPS results can be directly
sent to the CASSIS tool or used separately to describe the SM bio—
synthetic potential of a species.

2 Methods

The SMIPS and CASSIS tools are two discrete software tools, with
the option to run CASSIS on the output of SMIPS. In this section,
we provide a step—by—step description of the entire work—flow.

2.1 Training data

A positive training set of 38 known (experimentally proven) SM
gene clusters was used to estimate the parameters of the CASSIS
search. This collection is restricted to clusters which have been veri—
fied experimentally by gene inactivation (disruption, deletion or
knock—out), gene over—expression experiments, assigning gene func—
tions to steps in the biosynthesis, or observable co—regulation of
transcription. This set was manually collected based on literature
and can be found in Supplementary Table 51.

For comparison with SMURF and antiSMASH, the training set
for CASSIS included the 24 clusters that were published in 2010 or
earlier (and hence could have been used for training of SMURF and
antiSMASH, too). Whereas, the test set contained only the 12 clus—
ters that were ‘new” for all three compared tools, i.e. published in
2011 or later (see Supplementary Table 51).

The genome sequences, protein sequences and corresponding gene
annotations were downloaded from the Broad Institute (http://www.
broadinstitute.org) or Aspergillus Genome Database (Cerqueira et 41.,
2014).

2.2 Evaluation

To assess the accuracy, precision, etc., of CASSIS and compare these
characteristics with other tools, we ran cross—validation experiments.
In each prediction, correctly identified cluster genes were considered
as true positives (TP). The total number of TP was the sum of all
genes of the considered clusters. The cluster genes not detected as TP
by a predictive tool were counted as false negatives (FN), genes pre—
dicted outside the genuine clusters were false positives (FP). To obtain
a feasible number of true negatives (TN), which are in general all
non—cluster genes and hence make a huge number for a whole contig
or a chromosome, we restricted the considered genomic region to
:30 genes around the anchor gene (because the largest so far known
cluster—aﬂatoxin—contains about 30 genes). Note that this

prediction algorithm can be simplified, so that the scoring system
applied in the MDM version can be dropped. Instead of the ‘frame
scores” used in MDM, we now applied a more straightforward ap—
proach of ‘gap rules” as described in Section 2.5.4. This made the al—
gorithm more transparent, easier to adjust and easier to interpret.
Besides this innovation, we added and improved several features.
We drastically increased the number of promoter sets (from 7 to
250), which are submitted to MEME for motif prediction. This
makes the search for the best common motif more precise, improv—
ing the accuracy of the entire cluster prediction. We also introduced
several cut—off values to filter out unpromising or invalid intermedi—
ate results: (i) the E—value cut—off for motifs predicted by MEME,
(ii) the p—value cut—off for FIMO hits, (iii) the percentage cut—off for
the number of promoters with binding sites compared with all pro—
moters in the genome (genome—wide frequency of the motif), and
(iv) the maximal gap length within the cluster. Altogether this
helped to decrease the number of FF and to increase the specificity
and accuracy (see Section 3.2).

To make the workflow smooth and independent, we added a
small but useful tool called SMIPS for the preliminary prediction of
(all potential SM anchor genes in the given genome.)
Methodologically, SMIPS does not differ from other tools for PKS
and NRPS predictions, basing on the HMM models for typical do—
mains of SM enzymes. However, as CASSIS requires predefined an—
chor genes as input, we found it more convenient to add SMIPS to
the CASSIS workflow. In this way, we avoid preliminary runs of
other tools (such as SMURF) to obtain the anchor genes informa—
tion. In addition to sending the output of SMIPS to CASSIS, it can
be used independently for the annotation and description of SM
genes.

3.2 Assessment of the CASSIS performance, validation
and comparison with other tools

To assess the performance of our method and tool, we undertook a
series of leave—one—out (LOO) cross—validation experiments. As posi—
tive set we used the 38 experimentally proven fungal clusters
(Supplementary Table 51) and performed the LOO for each cluster.
The benchmarking shows high specificity, sensitivity, accuracy and
precision (Table 1). With this we show that over—fitting is not an
issue and our tool is able to reliably predict unknown clusters.

As the CASSIS approach is based on promoter analysis and is
thus very distant from similarity—based methods, it was interesting
to compare its performance with the most prominent similarity—
based tools antiSMASH and SMURF. We applied the tools to the re—
identification of the clusters with known borders. To make a clean
experiment and put all three tools in equal position, we included in
our training set those clusters that were characterized before the
publication of antiSMASH and SMURF and hence could be used for
their training (at least for SMURF). On the other hand, the clusters

 

published after 2010 were considered as ‘new” for all three tools and
used as test set. The comparison reveals that antiSMASH has a
higher sensitivity but the number of FF predictions made by similar—
ity—based methods is also higher: compared with CASSIS,
antiSMASH suggests in average four FP more per cluster. This re—
flects the tendency of the similarity tools to overestimate the clus—
ters” lengths, even though they pick up the right genes with high
sensitivity. As a result, CASSIS outperforms the other tools in speci—
ficity, accuracy and precision (Table 2, Supplementary Table S3 and
Supplementary Fig. 51). Moreover, in some cases the similarity—
based tools failed to recognize the anchor gene, which lead to the
loss of the whole cluster (see Supplementary Fig. S2). For instance,
in Aspergillus nidulans the ent—pimara—S(14),15—diene cluster is lost
by antiSMASH and SMURF because they do not recognize AN15 94
as the anchor gene. CASSIS/SMIPS did not encounter any problems
in the detection of all anchors.

See Supplementary Table S4 for a more general comparison of
the features of all four tools.

4 Discussion

Clustering of genes implies their co—localization, co—regulation and
assignment to the same process. In the case of SM, this is a biosyn—
thetic pathway and/or further processing of the product. Most of the
approaches developed for the genome—wide cluster prediction rely
on protein domain similarity. Thus, they use the first and last prop—
erties of the clusters but ignore the co—expression (or co—regulation).
Our approach is in this sense complementary, as it ignores the func—
tional features of the proteins but considers the promoter informa—
tion. This constitutes both an advantage and a disadvantage of the
approach. The advantage is the consideration of a new, yet unused
layer of information (promoters, motifs, sites), which is, moreover,
the key feature of the cluster definition. The disadvantage is the neg—
lect of the remaining information, but this can be seen as a special—
ization. Indeed, the similarity—based tools exist and at least one of
them, antiSMASH, gives very good, although not perfect, predic—
tions. Our aim is not to compete with antiSMASH or to substitute
it. We suppose that the optimal predictions can be achieved by
application of both tools simultaneously: antiSMASH is more sensi—
tive but CASSIS is more precise, and each of them supplies with spe—
cific information about the discovered clusters (see Supplementary
Table S4).

Motifs that are shared by the cluster genes (and form in this way
the basis of the cluster prediction) have their own value as the poten—
tial TFBS of the cluster”s presumable regulator. CASSIS provides the
option to retrieve the motifs corresponding to the detected clusters.

Moreover, as the motifs” occurrences are scanned genome—wide, it is
possible to find sub—clusters (also called super—clusters), which are
groups of genes regulated by the same TF, simultaneously with the
‘main” cluster, but located in another part of the genome. If a sub—
cluster is large enough (more than three genes), it can be detected
quite easily. In the next versions of CASSIS we plan to implement
such a feature.

Like MDM, CASSIS is not restricted to the prediction of SM
clusters. Other types of gene clusters can be represented by different
anchor genes, depending on the pathway or process, for which the
genes are clustered. As CASSIS does not consider the properties of
genes, the nature of the anchor gene does not matter.

Being based on the de novo motif discovery, CASSIS is quite sen—
sitive to the quality of the genome assembly. Two features are im—
portant: the length of contigs (scaffolds) and the information quality
of the sequence. The former feature is, actually, important for any
cluster prediction tool, since clusters are lengthy stretches of gen—
omic sequence, which should be preferably uninterrupted. The in—
formation quality becomes important for genomes with low
complexity (AT—rich) regions, since it is hard to predict significant
motifs in such sequences.

5 Implementation and availability

The CASSIS method is implemented in a tool with the same name.
User—friendly online versions of both SMIPS and CASSIS (the
‘CASSIS suite”) are available at https://sbi.hki—jena.de/cassis. The
suite also provides a comfortable workflow to run CASSIS on the re—
sults of SMIPS. The source codes as well as executeable files for
Linux and Windows are freely available at https://sbi.hki—jena.de/cas
sis/Download.php. The SMIPS and CASSIS tools are implemented
in Perl 5.

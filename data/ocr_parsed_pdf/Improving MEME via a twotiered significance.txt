output relative to its capability or the signiﬁcance estimate will be
overly conservative (Ng et al., 2006).

Therefore, in spite of its immense popularity (MEME and
MEME—ChIP had >13 000 unique users in 2012 and >9000
unique users through the first half of 2013), MEME’s signiﬁ—
cance evaluation leaves room for improvement.

In previous work, we described a computationally intensive
alternative to the E—value that takes into account the finder’s
performance and avoids the above problems with E—values (Ng
and Keich, 2008a,b). Speciﬁcally, for some motif flnders includ—
ing MEME, the null distribution of the score of the reported
motif seems to be well approximated by the 3—parameter
Gamma [The distribution function of a 3—parameter Gamma
with 6 = (a, b, IL) is given by F9(s) = Fp(a‘;,)(s — IL), where
Fm“) is the Gamma distribution with it usual shape and scale
parameters, and [L is the location parameter (Johnson et al.,
1994)], or 3—Gamma, family of distributions (Ng et al., 2006).
Relying on this empirical observation, we designed a parametric
test that returns a point estimator of, as well as a conservative
confidence bound on, the signiﬁcance of the reported motif
(Keich and Ng, 2007).

Having demonstrated the effectiveness of the 3—Gamma sig—
niﬁcance evaluation scheme (Ng and Keich, 2008a), and having
bundled it with a Gibbs sampling flnder (Ng and Keich, 2008b),
we considered adopting it for MEME in lieu of the E—value.
However, in addition to conveying to the user an overall measure
of the statistical signiﬁcance, the E—value is also used internally in
MEME to rank competing candidate motifs of which often only
the highest scoring one is reported. Although the 3—Gamma ap—
proach can be used, for example, to choose among competing
motifs of different widths (Ng and Keich, 2008a), it then be—
comes forbiddingly computationally intensive for assigning an
overall signiﬁcance as well. This motivated our design of a
two—tiered significance analysis that we introduce and explore
in the remainder of this article. The first tier consists of statistical
tests that replace the E—value in selecting the best candidate
among competing motifs. The second tier consists of applying
the 3—Gamma scheme to assign an overall statistical signiﬁcance.
The results we present indicate that we will be able to improve
both motif quality and the accuracy of motif signiflcance esti—
mates while allowing MEME to handle larger datasets in reason—
able time.

2 CHOOSING THE BEST CANDIDATE MOTIF

Although MEME relies on EM to converge on a candidate
motif, it uses multiple runs of EM (the preﬁx ME in MEME
stands for multiple EM) with different initial values when explor—
ing the space of possible motifs. For example, in the OOPS (one
occurrence per sequence) mode, when faced with a range of pos—
sible motif widths, MEME runs multiple EMs using several dif—
ferent widths in the specified range. Each EM run yields a
candidate motif, and MEME reports the motif with the lowest
E—value. In ZOOPS (zero or one occurrence per sequence) mode,
MEME needs to address the additional freedom of choosing the
sequences that contain an instance of the motif. Therefore, for a
given width, MEME starts multiple EMs, assuming a different
number of motif instances and the motifs obtained following

some further processing are then compared based again on
their E—values.

In seeking to replace the E—valueibased selection, we were
inﬂuenced by the discriminative approach that is used to address
essentially the same problem in several tools including Amadeus
(Linhart et al., 2008) and DREME (Bailey, 2011). The idea is to
evaluate a motif by comparing the number of occurrences of the
motif in the original input set with the number of occurrences in
a background set that can be a reference genome or a randomly
drawn set of sequences modeled after the input set. The signiﬁ—
cance of the observed difference is then essentially assessed in
those tools using the hypergeometric distribution as explained in
more detail later in the text.

2.1 The minimal hypergeometric score

DREME’s discriminative motif score first uses Fisher’s exact test
to evaluate the difference between the number of motif occur—
rences in the input set and in the background set (by default a
random shufﬂe of the input set). It then adjusts the result, taking
into account that the number of motifs it considers grows with
the width of the motif: the motif score is the product of the
Fisher exact test and the number of motifs tested at the given
width.

Although DREME’s selection strategy has been shown to be
effective, it cannot be applied as is in MEME’s context. DREME
models a motif using a regular expression, and therefore, an oc—
currence of the motif is well deﬁned, as is the number of possible
motifs of a given width. MEME, however, models a motif using
a position weight matrix (PWM) so an occurrence of a motif
instance is threshold—dependent and the number of possible
motifs is inﬁnite.

Amadeus also uses the PWM model and the solution its au—
thors adopted was the same one used in Barash et a]. (2001) and
Eden et a]. (2007), which is to set the site score threshold so that
the signiﬁcance of the difference between the number of sites in
the input set and in the background set (a genomic reference set
in Amadeus’ case) would be maximized. As this threshold—de—
pendent signiﬁcance is evaluated using the hypergeometric dis—
tribution, the resulting minimal P—value is referred to in Linhart
et a1. (2008) as the hypergeometric enrichment score.

Here we adopted DREME’s strategy of using a randomly
drawn background set of sequences of the same number and
lengths as the original input set. In DREME, these sequences
are drawn using shuffling of the original input set, whereas here
we draw the sequences from genomic sequences with a similar
A—T composition (see Supplementary Section S1.1.4 for details).
We refer to Amadeus’ discriminative hypergeometric enrichment
score in our context as the minimal hypergeometric score, or
MHG score for short. The term MHG score was introduced in
Eden et a]. (2007) and later used in Steinfeld et a]. (2008) and
Eden et a]. (2009) in a more general context. However, as we
show in Supplementary Section S1.1.8, our speciﬁc usage here is
consistent with the more general framework.

We stress that although the MHG score is deﬁned in terms of
some P—value, it should be viewed as a discriminative score rather
than a P—value per se. As the evaluated PWM is optimized rela—
tive to the input set of sequences and is truly independent of the

randomly drawn set of sequences, the null hypothesis of the
hypergeometric/ Fisher exact test is blatantly violated.

As our discriminative score is supposed to help us, among
other things, pick the best among competing motifs of varying
widths, it is desirable that it be unbiased. That is, the score better
not have a tendency to prefer, for example, longer motifs over
shorter ones. Unfortunately, longer motifs tend to be more dis—
criminative than shorter ones, and hence, it is not surprising that
we found that the MHG score exhibits a fairly strong bias
toward longer motifs (Fig. 1a). However, this bias is measured

Selective MHG
Fig. 1. Null distribution of motif scores. The ﬁgure shows the boxplots
constructed from 10 000 observations of non-selective (a) and selective (b)
versions of the MHG scores for each motif width (ranged from 6 to 13).
The scores were generated by applying MEME to randomly drawn input
set of sequences of a ﬁxed dimension (number of sequences and their
lengths). See Supplementary Section $12 for details

when the input set itself is randomly drawn, and in this context it
is harmless: we do not care which random motif MEME will
select when there are no ‘real’ motifs to be found. An arguably
more important issue is how well our discriminative score does at
picking up the right motif when the data does contain one.

We therefore designed a set of experiments to test the ‘power’
of a motif score, or its ability to select the correct motif. In the
experiments described in detail in the Supplementary Section S1.
3, we looked at the number of times each score is able to select a
motif that is ‘sufﬁciently similar’ to the implanted one. The input
sequences were randomly drawn from a set of intergenic genomic
sequences and instances of one of 100 motifs were implanted into
these otherwise unrelated genomic sequences. Those 100 motifs
(of width &23) were selected so as to form a ‘minimal spanning
set’ of a much larger set of 510 motifs: they were chosen so as to
cover the motif space while minimizing the similarities between
them as much as possible (Supplementary Section S1.3.1).
Special care was also given so that the motif—ﬁnding problem
presented to MEME would be at the right difﬁculty level: not
too easy nor too difﬁcult. This was accomplished by iteratively
modifying the dimensions of the randomly drawn input sets re—
sulting in sets with varying length and number of sequences:
sequence length ranged from 100 to a maximum of 10000
(median of set—average length ~ 550), and the number of se—
quences ranged from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 100
(median ~ 22) (see Supplementary Section S1.3.2 for details).

MEME was then applied several times to each input set using
the same set of several parameter settings. Each application pro—
duced a competing putative motif representing a different section
of the candidate motifs space. This was done in such a way that
MEME’s E—value did not affect the ﬁnal motif. For example, in
the OOPS mode, each MEME run was given a different motif
width in the range $13, whereas in ZOOPS mode, we varied the
speciﬁed number of sites MEME looks for (—nsites) as well as
covarying this number of sites and the width of the motif. The
scoring function, in this case either the E—value or the MHG
score, was used to select the best candidate motif suggested by
MEME. Finally, Tomtom (Gupta et al., 2007; Tanaka et al.,
2011) was used to determine whether the selected motif was
sufﬁciently similar to the implanted motif (speciﬁcally a
Tomtom P—value cutoff of 0.05 was used), in which case the
motif was considered correctly discovered. See Supplementary
Section S1.3.4 for more details.

We found that in the OOPS mode, the MHG—based selection
yields ~10% more correct motif identiﬁcations than the
E—valueibased selection. This difference is deemed statistically
signiﬁcant using a sign test (Supplementary Table S1b and
Supplementary Sections S1.3.5). In the ZOOPS mode, when
varying both the width and the number of sites MEME looks
for (—nsites), we notice an even more substantial improvement of
32% additional correct identiﬁcations, which is again statistically
signiﬁcant (Fig. 2). Fixing the width and varying only MEME’s —
nsites parameter in ZOOPS mode, the MHG score shows con—
sistent improvement over the E—value, albeit the number of add—
itional motifs discovered varies from a substantial 42% (width 6)
to a modest 6.8% (width 13, see Supplementary Table S4). Thus,
in spite of the strong bias it exhibits on null sets, the MHG score
is more powerful than the E—value at selecting the correct motif
when such a motif is present.

o A thresholded version of the MW (tMW) score applies the
MW test to the same lists as originally, only with all low
scoring sites removed. Similarly, we looked at a selective
version of the thresholded MW. These two scores depend
on a site—threshold, that is, the site is only considered if its
PWM score exceeds a per—dataset threshold.

0 The Fisher exact test (Fisher) compares the number of site—
bearing sequences in the input set with the same number in
the null generated set as does the selective version of the
Fisher exact test (removing a few of the low—entropy scoring
columns from the PWM). These two scores also depend on a
per—dataset threshold on sites.

0 The ‘sign score’ (Sign) is deﬁned by applying the sign test to
compare the number of input sequences whose best site
score is higher than the best scoring site in the corresponding
null generated sequence with the number of sequences for
which the reversed statement held (the best null—sequence
score is higher than the best input—sequence score). Again,
a selective version of this score was also considered.

0 The ‘minimal sign score’ (MSign) is deﬁned similarly to the
sign score except we applied the sign test only to pairs of
input—null sequences for which the maximal score exceeded a
site—threshold. We then varied the threshold so that the score
would be most signiﬁcant (minimal sign test p—value). A se—
lective variant of this score was also looked at.

None of the site—threshold41ependent variants (the Fisher
exact test and the thresholded MW variants) outperformed the
selective MHG score in a statistically signiﬁcant way, and all
performed significantly worse in at least some of the tests
(Supplementary Tables S17S3). In light of these results and be—
cause finding the per—data threshold increases the computational
cost of the score, we see no reason to prefer any of the site—de—
pendent scores over the selective MHG score.

The selective versions of all the motif scores performed better
than their non—selective counterparts, which conﬁrms the beneﬁt
of reducing the motif width bias. The beneﬁt of using the select—
ive variants increases with the searched motif width
(Supplementary Table S4), but we suspect this phenomenon is
only partially explained by the reduction of bias. Real motifs
often contain short stretches of uninformative columns (Xing
and Karp, 2004), and hence, we are potentially adding noise
when these uninformative columns form an integral part of the
PWM. In contrast, the selective versions of our scores filter out
some of the uninformative columns, thereby increasing the signal
to noise ratio. This side effect of the heuristic used by the select—
ive versions of the motif scores may be partially responsible for
their higher accuracies.

The selective MW score performed slightly better than the
selective MHG score in the OOPS set of experiments
(Supplementary Table S1), suggesting that the optimal motif
score could be different when running MEME in ZOOPS versus
OOPS mode. Although this is possible, it is not clear that the
added design complexity is merited by the performance differ—
ence, which was not deemed statistically signiﬁcant in our experi—
ments. At the same time, the advantage of the selective MHG
score over the selective MW score in the ZOOPS setting was also
not deemed statistically significant (Supplementary Table S3b),

and so in terms of their power, these two discriminative scores
are fairly comparable in our experimental setup.

The selective sign—test variants are simple to calculate and per—
form similarly to the selective MHG and MW scores but lose to
both scores in a statistically signiﬁcant way in the OOPS setting
(Supplementary Table S1).

Finally, we were curious to ﬁnd out how well the 3—Gammai
estimated P—value would do in selecting the most promising
motif (Supplementary Section S1.1.12). Because of the intensive
computational nature of the 3—Gamma score, we only looked at
the OOPS test set, and the 3—Gamma motif score was slightly less
accurate than the selective MHG score at choosing the best can—
didate motif (599 versus 608, Supplementary Table S1a), but this
difference is not statistically signiﬁcant (Supplementary Table
S1b). So, again, we see that inherent calibration (as the
3—Gamma score has by deﬁnition, see Supplementary Fig. S1d)
does not necessarily mean superior performance in picking the
best motif. Regardless, note that using the 3—Gamma approach
for selecting the best motif is not a practical option if the latter is
also to be used to assign an overall significance: the resulting
procedure is computationally forbiddingly demanding. Rather
this experiment should be taken as further validating the power
of the selective MW and MHG scores.

3 ASSESSING THE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
OF THE REPORTED MOTIF

As we pointed out above, the selective MHG and MW scores are
discriminative ones and cannot be used to directly assign an
overall statistical signiﬁcance to the selected motif. For that,
we suggest using our computationally intensive 3—Gamma para—
metric scheme. The protocol we adopted here is essentially the
same as described in Ng and Keich (2008a, b): the input set is
used as a template to generate 11 independently drawn null sets
(we suggest n: 50), and MEME is applied to the null sets in
exactly the same way as it is applied to the original set of se—
quences. In particular, our protocol uses the selective MHG (or
MW) score to select the best motif in each of the null drawn sets,
i.e. an additional random (background) set is generated for every
one of the n null sets and the discriminative score is computed
relative to these two null sets.

The score assigned to the input set of sequences, as well as to
each of the n null drawn sets, is minus the log of the selective
MHG (MW) P—value of the chosen motif, i.e. it is minus the log
of the smallest selective MHG (MW) P—value among all candi—
date motifs.

The 3—Gamma P—value of the motif selected from the input set
of sequences is estimated using the scores from the null drawn
sets as described in Supplementary Section S1.1.12 except that
the current score is used instead of the MEME—reported llr score:
the maximum likelihood estimate is estimated from the n null
scores and then plugged into the 3—Gamma distribution function
to yield the 3—Gamma P—value.

We found support to the assumption that the null distribution
of the motif score can be approximated to a 3—Gamma distribu—
tion empirically by considering the probability plot of 100 000
null selective MHG scores and the ﬁtted 3—Gamma curve in
Figure 3 (see Supplementary Fig. S4 for the probability plot of

either the E—value or the signiﬁcance assigned by applying the 3—
Gamma procedure to the selective MW (3GMW) or MHG
(3GMHG) scores of the E—valueiselected motif. Unlike in the
previously described experiments, here the same motif is selected
by all the methods, and thus, we can compare them using the
standard ROC curve (TP rate versus FP rate). The area under
the ROC curve (aROC) of the 3GMW or 3GMHG (0.839 and
0.821, respectively) is much larger than that of the E—value
(0.530), which is about what you expect from a random classiﬁer
(Supplementary Table S7). Thus, the E—value is markedly less
accurate as a measure of statistical significance than our two—
tiered method. However, for small datasets, the E—value compu—
tation is ~50 times faster than the 3—Gamma signiﬁcance
evaluation.

5 SCORE CALIBRATION

The main goal of the 3—Gamma analysis is to provide the user
with a usable signiﬁcance analysis. Such analysis should, by def—
inition, be calibrated. That is, the more signiﬁcant the score is,
the more likely the motif is not an artifact. On the other hand, a
score can be well calibrated even if it fails to convey statistical
significance.

We compared the calibration level of the selective MHG and
MW scores by comparing their classiﬁcation power against that
of the two—tiered scheme. Speciﬁcally we asked whether the ROC
curve obtained by using each of these two discriminative scores
on their own is improved by using the 3—Gammaiassigned
P—value instead of the discriminative score (Supplementary
Fig. S6).

It was rather surprising to see that, in terms of calibration, the
3—Gamma41erived analysis adds little to the fairly well—calibrated
selective MHG and MW scores. Still, it was reassuring to find
that the aROC is slightly higher when we further calibrate those
scores using the 3—Gamma4estimated P—values (see
Supplementary Table S6).

It remains to be seen whether our selective discriminative
scores are well calibrated in a larger setting, where, for example,
we might have thousands of input sequences. However, if they
are well calibrated, then we could assign the 3—Gamma signiﬁ—
cance at no additional computational cost. If the score is per—
fectly calibrated, then a unique universal 3—Gamma distribution
applies to all input sets. While it is clear that some accuracy will
be lost this wayithe discriminative scores are not perfectly cali—
brated as we see from the fact that the aROC is slightly lower
than when using the 3—Gamma P—valueithe trade—off in terms
of signiﬁcantly reduced runtime might be deemed favorable to
some of the users.

In contrast with the well—calibrated discriminative scores, we
noted that the E—value is poorly calibrated. This is further illu—
strated in Supplementary Figure S7, where the actual motif se—
lection is guided by the E—value but the overall signiﬁcance is
assessed by either the E—value or by our two—tiered analysis
applied to the motif selected by the E—value. We note that even
though the motif of each input set is selected by the E—value, our
two—tiered analysis is doing a much better job in ranking the
selected motifs.

6 ANALYSIS OF REAL DATA

The results presented so far were derived from datasets that were
synthesized using real motifs implanted in real, though unrelated,
sequences. The advantage of using synthetic data is that you
have control over the degree of difﬁculty of the motif—ﬁnding
problem as well as a well—deﬁned ‘correct’ outcome. As such
we find it optimal for comparison between methods. Still, one
might ask whether the differences we observe in our synthetic sets
are at all relevant to ‘real’ biological data.

To address this question, we analyzed a dataset curated by
Narlikar et a]. (2007), which consists of 156 sequence sets derived
from the Harbison ChIP—chip experiments using 80 transcription
factors (Harbison et al., 2004). We found that, as in the case of
the synthetic data, MEME performs signiﬁcantly better when the
motif selection is guided by either our selective MHG or MW
scores than when guided by MEME’s E—value: 2&29% more
correct identiﬁcation, and both improvements are statistically
signiﬁcant (Supplementary Section S8). Both non—selective ver—
sions of the MW and MHG scores give a more modest 14%
improvement over the E—value; however, this improvement is
not deemed statistically signiﬁcant.

Similarly, our complete two—tiered analysis is doing a much
better job than the E—value in discerning between correct and
incorrect motif identifications. For example, using 3GMHG,
which is the 3—Gamma analysis based on the selective MHG
score, we find 40 correct identiﬁcations and 15 incorrect ones
at the traditional 0.05 signiﬁcance threshold. In contrast, using
MEME’s E—value, we find 30 correct and 41 incorrect identiﬁca—
tions at the same nominal level of 0.05 (Supplementary Table
S9). More generally, comparing the FP versus TP counts, we see
a similar picture to the one we saw with the synthetic data: the
two—tiered analysis completely dominates the E—valueibased ana—
lysis with a particularly striking difference in the critical region of
low—FP count (Supplementary Fig. S8).

Given that we analyzed 156 sequence sets, even the 15 incor—
rect identiﬁcations that our 3GMHG score reports are more
than what we would like to see at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level.
However, in classifying a reported motif as an incorrectly identi—
ﬁed one, we are not necessarily claiming that the found motif is
insigniﬁcant. These are real datasets that might contain binding
sites of auxiliary motifs. If such motifs are reported, they would
be classiﬁed as incorrect identiﬁcations; yet, they are not insig—
niﬁcant random motifs. Thus, it is not surprising that we ﬁnd
more incorrect identiﬁcations than we expect assuming those
motifs are truly random. The latter can only be guaranteed
using synthetic data.

7 DISCUSSION

We propose a two—tiered significance analysis to replace the
E—value currently used in MEME to select the best among com—
peting EM—generated motifs as well as to assign an overall stat—
istical significance. We showed that our selective MHG or MW
discriminative scores substantially increase the percentage of cor—
rect motif identiﬁcations by simply applying a more judicious
selection criterion to choose the best of MEME’s several EM
generated PWMsino change in the search strategy is involved.

As the complexity of our selection procedure is linear in the
size of the input set (with a small constant), it can be integrated
into MEME at a marginal computational cost. As the currently
implemented computation of the E—value in MEME is cubic in
the number of sequences, our selective MHG and MW schemes
compare favorably against the E—value on that account as well,
especially with ChIP—seq data with thousands of sequences in
mind.

The second part of our two—tiered analysis is associated with a
substantial computational cost, as it requires running MEME on
n randomly generated images of the input set (we recommend
n=50). Our 3—Gamma signiﬁcance analysis then uses these n
runs to provide a parametric approximation to the P—value of
the observed motif. Again we note that although a factor of 50 is
a substantial runtime penalty, the current computation of the E—
value in MEME incurs an even greater penalty when studying
thousands of sequences.

In summary, our two—tiered analysis offers a substantial im—
provement in ﬁnding the correct motif without requiring any
change to MEME’s underlying EM motif search strategy. The
difference between the signal to noise ratio (TP to FP) of the
two—tiered approach and of the E—value approach is particularly
striking in the more important region of low noise.

We also showed that the E—value as currently implemented in
MEME is not particularly well suited for selecting motifs of
competing width: it did worse than the single best width. Also,
it is not a good measurement of an overall significance: as a
classiﬁer comparing motifs from multiple datasets, it performed
about as good as a random one. Taken together, we expect our
two—tiered analysis will significantly improve the performance of
MEME. Given MEME’s popularity, this improvement can make
a substantial practical impact on bioinformatics research.

MEME assumes its input set is uniformly weighted. In cases
where one can assign different weights to the input sequences, for
example, the binding intensity of a probe, other methods that use
such data might yield even better results (Leibovich and Yakhini,
2013).

We stress that although our two—tiered analysis was demon—
strated in the context of MEME, it should be applicable more
broadly. Certainly, the selective MHG or MW scores could in
principle be applied to selecting one of several candidate motifs.
Moreover, the associated computational cost is only linear in the
size of the input set. The wider applicability of our 3—Gamma
scheme is more tentative. It is important to understand that it is
an approximation, and so, at the end of the day the question is
whether there are better alternatives. Our experience shows that
the 3—Gamma family is better than the normal and even the ex—
treme value distributions at approximating the null distribution
of the optimal motif score in the examples we considered (Ng
and Keich, 2008a, b, and Fig. 3). Whether this applies to the
user’s choice of scoring function, motif finder and null model is
something that can be looked at empirically.

Although, Amadeus (Linhart et al, 2008) also allows the user
to apply an essentially two—tiered analysis through its bootstrap
option, there are several differences between it and our proposed
solution. First, Amadeus uses the MHG score to choose the best
motif, which, as we saw, can be substantially inferior to the se—
lective MHG score we propose. Second, when using the boot—
strap option, Amadeus reports an overall signiﬁcance using a

normal approximation, which as we showed can substantially
overestimate the true signiﬁcance of the motif (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Fig. S4).

Whether one should choose to use the selective MW or the
selective MHG score seems to depend on the problem: in the
OOPS context, the MW had the advantage, while in the ZOOPS
experiments, the MHG did better. None of these advantages was
deemed statistically signiﬁcant. The MHG score has one advan—
tage over the MW score: in the ZOOPS mode, it can be used to
determine which sequences contain a site, whereas with the MW
score, some other method should be used for that purpose.

Our future plans are to determine whether we can estimate a
universal 3—Gamma distributions for DNA and protein motifs
before incorporating our two—tiered approach into MEME. If
this is not possible, we will incorporate the proposed two—tier
approach as is, which is how we will incorporate it into
GIMSAN (Ng and Keich, 2008b).

Finally we note that the formula for the number of selected
columns [Equation (1)] in the selective variants of the scores was
not optimized, leaving the door open for potential improvement
through optimization of this selection criterion.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The reverse-phase protein lysate arrays have been
used to quantify the relative expression levels of a protein in a
number of cellular samples simultaneously. To avoid quantification
bias due to mis-specification of commonly used parametric models,
a nonparametric approach based on monotone response curves
may be used. The existing methods, however, aggregate the protein
concentration levels of replicates of each sample, and therefore fail
to account for within-sample variability.

Results: We propose a method of regularization on protein
concentration estimation at the level of individual dilution series to
account for within-sample or within-group variability. We use an
efficient algorithm to optimize an approximate objective function,
with a data-adaptive approach to choose the level of shrinkage.
Simulation results show that the proposed method quantifies protein
concentration levels well. We show through the analysis of protein
lysate array data from cell lines of different cancer groups that
accounting for within-sample variability leads to better statistical
analysis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein microarray technologies [e.g. Cahill and Nordhoff (2003);
Ivanov et al. (2004); MacBeath and Schreiber (2000)] have been
developed to measure protein concentrations in a high-throughput
fashion. Extensive reviews of this technology can be found in
Borrebaeck and Wingren (2007) and Poetz et al. (2005). A single
nitrocellulose-coated array slide can measure concentrations of a
common protein in hundreds of samples in the form of dilution
series. The samples are hybridized and label-attached with primary
and biotinylated secondary antibodies and the protein concentrations
are then measured using streptavadin-linked labels that bind to the
biotin. The ﬁnal product of each array is an image ﬁle in which

quantiﬁed spots represent the observed protein expression levels at
various dilutions steps.

Protein lysate array technology has shown its promise in a
number of Clinical studies [e.g. Pluder et al. (2006); Sahin et al.
(2007)]. In particular, its applications to various cancer studies have
been documented extensively; see, for example, Cai et al. (2010);
Carey et al. (2010); Cheng et al. (2005); Grote et al. (2008); Kim
et al. (2008); Spurrier et al. (2008); Tibes et al. (2006). Various
procedures to improve the analysis of protein lysate arrays have
been proposed recently. For example, Brase et al. (2010) proposed
antibody-mediated signal ampliﬁcation to increase the sensitivity of
this technology. Neeley et al. (2009) introduced a variable slope
normalization among arrays to help reduce loading bias and recover
true correlation structures among proteins.

In this article, we focus on the protein quantiﬁcation problem
of estimating the relative protein concentrations in the arrayed
samples. In this area, the commercial analysis package MicroVigene
(http://www.vigenetech.Com/products.htm) estimates the protein
expression level by ﬁtting a four-parameter logistic model to each
dilution series. Kreutz et al. (2007) used a linear model between
the observed protein expressions (or at logarithmic scale) and the
underlying concentration levels. Tabus et al. (2006) modeled the
mean of the observed expression level as a sigmoidal curve and
estimated the model parameters via the non-linear least squares.
Alternatively, Zhang et al. (2009) modeled the serial dilution
curve based on the Sips model (similar to the logistic model) to
Characterize the relationship between signals in successive dilution
steps. These methods can be considered as parametric.

On the contrary, Hu et al. (2007) proposed a non-parametric
approach by assuming that the median of the observed protein
expression is equal to a monotonically increasing ﬁinction without
a parametric form. This non-parametric method, contained in a
recently developed statistical tool RPPanalyzer for analyzing protein
lysate array data (Mannsperger et al., 2010), is highly data-
adaptive without bias due to mis-speciﬁcation of g. Simulation
studies and real experiments have shown the advantage of the non-
parametric approach in producing robust results in a variety of
scenarios. However, the existing methods of estimation deteriorate
in performance as the noise to signal ratio increases in the data. In
addition, the non-parametric estimates, if used to estimate protein
concentration at the level of individual dilution series, tend to be
unstable due to data sparsity.

Our work aims at improving the accuracy of protein level
quantiﬁcation over the non-parametric procedure described in Hu

et al. (2007), by incorporating a method of regularization on
estimates within each sample. We start with a general description of
the problem.

Let yiﬂ be the observed expression level for the j-th replicate
of the i-th sample at the l-th dilution step (i: l, ...,m,j= l,--- ,ni,
and l: l,...,t). Each replicate is a dilution series of 1 steps. The
relationship between yiﬂ and the unobserved protein concentration
level xl-j (at the log scale) can be modeled as

Yzjl=g(xij—dl)+€ijh (1)

where g is the protein-speciﬁc response curve, d] deﬁnes the
corresponding dilution index at the l-th step and em denotes random
noise. In a typical dilution series, all —d1_1 = 1. In this formulation,
we allow each replicate to have its own protein concentration level
xl-j, which differs from the set-up of Hu et al. (2007), where xij =xl-
for all the replicates of the i-th sample. If we adopt the method of
Hu et al. (2007), we can estimate a non-parametric estimate of g, as
well as the concentration levels xl-j, by minimizing

2|ny —g(x.-j —dz)| +Am)gxlg”(x>l, (2)
i, j,l
for some smoothing parameter A, subject to the constraint that g is
a non-decreasing function. Note that xij are identiﬁable only up to
a constant, and the relative differences between xl-j’s are of interest
in protein concentration.

As pointed out by Yang and He (2011), the complexity of this
quantiﬁcation problem comes from the dimension of xl-j, which
increases with the sample size. One assumption made in earlier
work is that xl-j are constant within the i-th sample. This assumption
is practically useﬁil because it reduces the dimensionality of the
problem and ensures stable estimates. However, it could lead to bias
in estimation, and more importantly, could mask or distort variability
across replicates.

We propose to allow xl-j to vary with j but regularize the estimation
problem by using a penalty term on within-sample variabilities. As
a result, we shrink some of the replicate-level estimates to common
values but allow within-sample variabilities to be retained in other
samples as needed. As with other regularization methods in statistics,
our proposed method aims to balance the bias-variance trade-off in
a data-adaptive way.

The rest of the article is organized as follows. We describe the
new method, Regularized Nonparametric (Reno) analysis of lysate
arrays, in Section 2. We demonstrate the performance of the new
estimator through simulation studies in Section 3, and show how
the proposed method leads to better signiﬁcance testing in a real
data example in Section 4. Some concluding remarks are given in
Section 5.

2 METHODS

2.1 New objective function
We formulate the problem of simultaneously estimating g and the vector

x={xij:i=1,...,m;j=1,...,ni} as follows

ggnZIng-tgmj —dl>) +A1 V1(g>+A2V2(x> (3)
[a],

where

L0~g(x))= ly—gbmw
is the L1 loss function measuring the discrepancy between the observed
expression level yiﬂ and its ﬁtted value. and V1 and V; are penalty functions

on g and x. respectively. with A] and A2 to be determined. As in Hu et al.
(2007). we choose the penalty on g

V1(g)= mfx lg”(x) I. (4)

which leads to a quadratic spline solution of g (Koenker at al.. 1994). The
L1 loss function is appealing for lysate data quantiﬁcation. because the
unknown function g(x) corresponds to the median protein expression level.
and the relationship is equivariant under any monotone transformation of the
response.

The new penalty term V2(x) used in (3) aims to regularize the solution
of a high-dimensional vector x. Empirical results show that the optimization
problem without this penalty (that is. A; = 0) is often ill-conditioned and leads
to unstable results. The special case of A2 = 00 corresponds to the assumption
in earlier work that xi]- :xi for all j = 1, . . . ,n,». The results obtained under this
setting mask the variability across replicates.

In protein microarray experiments. it is often the case that the samples
can be divided into In subgroups G1 U - - - U G,,,. and the protein concentration
levels are similar within each subgroup. In this article. we focus on a common
case where each subgroup contains biological or technical replicates of some
kind. In our notation. all the replicates within the sample form a subgroup.
Naturally. we use the following penalty on x.

Ill Ill
V2<x>= Z: lxy- —x,»,-/ l = Z IAixii. (5)
i2] 1;] [:1
where xi=(xi1, . . . ,xim)’. and A, is the corresponding n, X n, symmetric
matrix such that the L1 norm of the vector Aixi equals ngj/ lxij —x,»]-/ |.
In summary. we consider a new objective function
Z lyiﬂ —g(x,»,- —dl)l +111 mfxlg”(x)l +1122 Mini. (6)
i,j,l i
Simultaneous optimization over g and x is numerically challenging. and we
propose an approximation to (6) in the next subsection.

2.2 Modiﬁed objective function
A natural way to solve (6) is a block-wise coordinate descent algorithm that
iterates between the following two steps:
0 Step 1: minimize (6) over g given x;
0 Step 2: minimize (6) overx given g.
Iterative algorithms of this type have been widely adopted (Hu et al.. 2007
and Tabus at al.. 2006). Step 1 reduces to

‘ H
mgn {  lyyl gm, dz)l +A1 m3ng UN} (7)
subject to the constrain that g is a non-decreasing function. This is the same
problem considered by Hu et al. (2007). and we use the same procedure as
before. The solution of g is a quadratic spline. and it can be found Via linear
programming with the R package Cabs developed by He and Ng (1999).
Given g. Step 2 solves

ngn{Elm—gory—dl>I+A2ZIAiin}. (8)
i,j,l i
which can be optimized for each i separately. Still. the non-linear nature of g

makes this problem harder. We propose to simplify the calculation by using
an approximate loss function. Note that

ly —g(x)l = Ig(g“ o» —g(x>l e lg’(x)l- Ix —g“(y>l. (9)
Then for the i-th subgroup. we solve. in lieu of (8).

j,l

where WW 2 |g’(xij —a’l)| and am =dl+g_l(yiﬂ) are calculated based on the
current values of g and xij’s from the previous iteration. What makes this
approximation attractive is that the optimization (10) can be solved by
weighted median quantile regression using the R package quantreg (Koenker.
2005).

In summary. our proposed method uses the following steps.

Regularized Non-parametric Analysis of Protein Lysate Arrays

 

0 Step 0 (Initialization): following Hu et al. (2007). we obtain initial
values of x as crude estimates of xijzxi by assuming g taking a
sigmoidal form g(x) =01 +ﬁ/(1+2_VX).

Perform Step 1 to ﬁnd an estimate of g from (7).

0 Given g from Step I. solve (10). and then center x by making the
median of x to be zero.

Iterate between the previous two steps until a stopping rule is
triggered. A useful stopping rule is to check if the objective function
in (3) changes by less than a pre-speciﬁed value for two consecutive
solutions.

After each iteration. we add a step to check whether the new estimates
indeed decrease the original objective function. If not. we do a grid search
in a neighborhood around the previous estimates to ensure the monotonic
decreasing of the objective function. We also note that centering x in each
step of the iteration helps identify g. In our empirical study. we found that
the algorithm converges quickly. often within four to ﬁve iterations.

2.3 Selection of tuning parameters

The tuning parameter A 1 is associated with the penalty for g in (6). We use the
procedure as in Hu et al. (2007). In this section. we consider a data-adaptive
choice of M.

We follow the basic idea of cross-validation (CV). but the special structure
of the lysate data renders the ordinary CV procedure ineffective. If a dilution
series Oil-1,...,yij,) were taken as a case to be left out. we would have no
validation data for that case. To accommodate the special structure here. we
propose a t-fold cross-validation. where the t observations from each dilution
series are assigned randomly to each of the t-folds. Each fold contains one
observation from each dilution series. Let Fk (k=1,...,t) denote the set of
indices (i,j,l) in the resulting k-th fold. and

t
A _ A —k
CV<A2>=§ E lyiﬂ—gl “(x5- l—dm.
k:li,j,leFk

kl

where gl-kl and XII].— are the estimates of g and xi]- based on data not in F k.

The parameter A; is chosen to minimize CV(A2).

3 SIMULATION STUDIES

To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we conduct
simulation studies to compare our procedure (Reno) with the
following alternatives:

0 Indep: the procedure with 22:0, which is equivalent to
estimating a different concentration level for each dilution
series.

0 Same: the procedure with 22:00, which is equivalent to
assuming that the replicates within each sample have exactly
the same protein concentration levels.

Nonpa: the procedure with M = 00, but (8) is solved using the
procedure of Hu et al. (2007), instead of the approximation
(10). We include this alternative procedure to evaluate the
accuracy of our approximation. It turns out that Same is much
faster than Nonpa without much sacriﬁce in accuracy.

0 Tabus: the parametric procedure based on sigmoid curve of
Tabus et al. (2006).

Oracle: the procedure with M = 00 only for the samples with
xlj=xi1 (j: 1, ...,nl-), and A; :0 otherwise. This procedure
requires the knowledge on the unknown quantities so it is used
only as an Oracle in the simulation for comparison purposes.

In the experiments, we simulate data of 300 dilution series, each
of length I = 6, from m = 100 samples with 111- = 3 replicates for each
sample. The three replicates for each sample form a subgroup. The
concentration levels of all the replicates for 60% of the samples are
generated to be identical, whereas the remaining 40% of the samples
have varying concentration levels from replicate to replicate.

Throughout this section, we evaluate the estimation error by

Erroax>=Zigmp—gowl, (11)
M

where g is the true response function. Note that I g(x) — g(z)| B
|g’(x)| - lx—zl, so this criterion downweights the estimation error of
x where I g’(x)| is small, i.e. in the nearly ﬂat regions of g. Obviously,
accuracies in the nearly ﬂat regions of g cannot be expected from any
method. We choose Oracle as the benchmark method and report the
relative error, the ratio of the error of each method to that of Oracle.

3.1 Experiment 1

In our ﬁrst experiment, the response curve is taken from two sigmoid
curves in the form of g(x)=a+ﬂ/(l +2—7’X) with a=3000 and
f3 = 10000, but y = 0.7 for positive x and y = 2.1 for negative x. For
positive x, the noise is generated from a sealed 1 distribution with
three degrees of freedom with the scale a =6000 >< (x+5)_1; for
negative x, the noise follows the normal distribution N(0,6002).

We conducted 100 simulation trials, and the results are
summarized in Figure 1. For the ﬁrst 20 datasets, the tuning
parameter A; was chosen adaptively by CV. The upper left panel
of Figure l is the boxplot of CV()\.2) based on these 20 datasets. The
value A: = 1500 is a good Choice for most datasets from this model.
To save time in the simulation study, we used this ﬁxed value for
all other datasets. But we expect the results for Reno to be similar
if the CV is done for each trial. The upper right panel of Figure l
is the boxplot of the relative errors of each competing method over
100 trials. It is Clear that the proposed method Reno outperforms its
competitors.

We repeated the data generating process with two smaller error
variances, where the SD is reduced by a factor of 2/3 and 1/2,
respectively. The results are summarized in the lower half of Figure
1. In all these cases, Tabus performed the worst due to model mis-
speciﬁcation. The performances of Nonpa and Same are similar.
When the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) is low, even if many of the
three replicates have different xij values, the variance deduction
from pooling information from the replicates to estimate a single
protein concentration level more than offsets the bias. Thus, Nonpa
and Same have smaller errors than Indep in the upper right panel
of Figure 1. When the SNR is higher, bias becomes dominating,
so Indep has a smaller error than Nonpa and Same in the lower
two panels of Figure 1. It is worth noting that Reno consistently
outperforms, and it even beats Oracle when the SNR is low. If
the calibration curve g were known, Oracle would have the best
performance. However, when g is unknown and the SNR is low,
adaptively borrowing information across replicates can improve
estimation accuracy of g and hence the quantiﬁcation accuracy of x.

3.2 Experiment 2

In the second experiment, we generated the response curve from
a single sigmoidal curve with a=1000, 5:4000 and y=0.8.
The errors were generated independently from normal distribution

the estimation errors (relative to Oracle) on 100 datasets are displayed in the upper right panel (original data generating process. A; 21500). the lower left

N(0, 5002). The true x values and the rest of the set-up are the same
as in Experiment 1. The result are now presented in Figure 2.

In this experiment, Indep is always inferior to others, conﬁrming
that estimating individual xg for all replicates is usually not
recommended. It is interesting to note that Same and Nonpa
outperform Oracle when the SNR is small (the upper right panel
of Fig. 2), but not in the other cases. Since the data are generated
from a sigmoidal curve, the results of Tabus are quite decent, but
Reno remains a top performer.

4 ANALYSIS WITH REAL DATA

We analyzed the protein lysate data from Mendes et al. (2007) with
the proposed Reno, as well as the non-parametric procedure Nonpa

from Hu et al. (2007) and the parametric procedure Tabus from Tabus
et al. (2006). The data consist of the intensity measurements for 90
samples from 52 protein arrays. Each sample has three replicates
that are diluted 2-fold six times. The ﬁtted curves from Reno and
Nonpa are very similar for all arrays, but the parametric curves look
different on some datasets. This is because the curve estimated by
Tabus is constrained to take the logistic shape, which may not ﬁt the
data well. Between Reno and Nonpa, we noticed that the estimated
protein concentration levels xl-j differ on a number of arrays. Those
differences have an impact on subsequent statistical analysis, as
shown in the example below.

The samples in this study are cell lines from 12 different cancer
groups. We use the data to ﬁnd out whether protein concentration
levels are signiﬁcantly different among cancer groups. We conducted

Fig. 3. Plots for protein cdk7. Left: plot of the observed dilution series for a subset of samples from the lung cancer group, where Sample 1 is the inﬂuential
sample mentioned in Section 4. Right: plot of the estimated protein concentration levels xi]- for Colon, Sarcoma and Lung cancer groups from Tabus (A,
1st column), Nonpa (+, 2nd column) and Reno (0, last two columns). The estimated concentration levels from Reno are displayed twice, one is the sample
average (one point for each sample, the third column) and the other is the raw data (three points for each sample, the last column).

the data of four samples from the lung cancer group in Figure 3 (left
panel). Sample 1 has higher expressions than the other samples,
and more importantly, there is a visible within-sample variation for
Sample 1, but not for the other samples. This information is reﬂected
in the estimates of protein concentrations from Reno: 4.2, 1.9 and
1.7 for the three replicates. As a consequence, Sample 1 gets down-
weighted in the statistical analysis with the following effects: (i)
it decreases the average of the lung cancer group, and therefore
enlarges the mean difference between groups; and (ii) it reduces the
group variance, making the t-test more powerful. This explains why
the P-values from Reno are less than a third of the P-values from
Nonpa.

Note that Reno provides more accurate and robust uncertainty
analysis than its competitors, but does not always provide smaller
P-values. In some cases, Reno points to the opposite direction when
Tabus and Nonpa report smaller P-values by ignoring within-sample
variations. Results from two other example slides (proteins p19 and
Zap70) listed in Table 1 demonstrate this point.

5 DISCUSSION

In this article, we propose a regularized estimation procedure in
non-parametric analysis of the protein lysate array quantiﬁcation,
which enables us to consider replicate-speciﬁc quantities when
the within-sample variability is signiﬁcant. We use a simple
approximation to the loss function so that the optimization can
be carried out by linear programs. We propose a specialized CV
method to select the tuning parameter that regulates the within-
sample variability. Earlier methods of lysate array quantiﬁcation
have to aggregate the replicates in each sample to avoid unstable
estimates, and in doing so, important information may get lost in the
aggregation. We demonstrate through simulated and real data that
the proposed method is helpful in providing additional information
about within-sample variabilities, which has important implications

in the subsequent statistical analysis of the lysate array data. Note
that the estimated calibration curves from different methods are
essentially the same, and the differences are in the concentration
estimates of individual samples.

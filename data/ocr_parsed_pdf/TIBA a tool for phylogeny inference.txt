singleton set containing just the end marker. Thus, a genome is repre-
sented by a set of adjacencies and telomeres. Any rearrangement oper-
ation changes up to three adjacencies or telomeres in the genome. For
multichromosomal genomes, all the rearrangement operations can be
modelled by a single operation called ‘Double-Cut-and-Join’ (DCJ)
(Yancopoulos et al., 2005).

For reconstruction, we use either NJ or FastME. The pairwise dis-
tances used are estimates of the true evolutionary distances under a model
of evolution that assumes uniform distribution of DCJ operations. The
evolutionary model is used to infer an estimate of the true distance by
deriving the effect of a given number of DCJ operations on the number of
shared adjacencies and telomeres and numerically inverting the derivation
to produce a maximum-likelihood estimate of the true distance under the
model. See (Lin and Moret, 2008) for details. Our extensive experiments
on simulated and real datasets, described in (Lin et al., 2011), show that
the error rates of trees reconstructed by NJ using this distance estimator is
<10% in all but the oversaturated cases. With FastME, the error rates are
even lower. Further, error rates are significantly reduced by an increase in
the size of the genomeibecause the larger number of syntenic blocks
reduces the relative error in the estimated distances. Trees can be recon-
structed on up to 500 genomes, each containing up to 10000 markers
within a few seconds on a PC.

As described in (Lin et al., 2012), we design and test several bootstrap-
ping methods that can be used with distance-based reconstruction from
rearrangement data. The fact that our distance estimator computes the
estimated true distance between two genomes based only on the number
of shared adjacencies in each genome allows us to design sampling meth-
ods for bootstrapping that can handle replicate genomes that may be
invalid (e.g. because of additional copies of adjacencies), and yet be suf-
ﬁcient for computing the pairwise distance (by tallying the number of
shared adjacencies). Two of these methods, BC and PJ are equivalent in
their performance and are better than all the other methods designed.
Their names come from their equivalent counterparts in the sequence
world: the classic bootstrap (BC) of Felsenstein and parsimony jackknif-
ing (PJ).

The key idea behind these bootstrapping methods is to create replicates
by sampling adjacencies; from the list of all possible adjacencies, BC
samples with replacement to form a collection of adjacencies; only adja-
cencies in this collection are then used to count the number of shared
adjacencies and then estimate the pairwise distances. PJ is (asymptotic-
ally) equivalent to sampling with replacement (as in BC), but without
overcounting, that is, when sampling gives an adjacency that has been
previously selected, it is not added to the replicate. In other words, se-
lected adjacencies are not counted more than once for computing the
number of shared adjacencies between leaf genomes. From each replicate,
a tree is reconstructed using our true distance estimator and NJ or
FastME. The bootstrap support of an edge (viewed as a bipartition of
leaves) in the inferred tree is the proportion of the trees from replicates
that contain the edge (the same bipartition of leaves). Both BC and PJ
show high sensitivity even at high levels of specificity, making them ex-
cellent bootstrap methods. We have also demonstrated, in (Lin et al.,
2012), that they outperform jackkniﬁng methods based on sampling mar-
kers, such as (Huang et al., 2010; Shi et al., 2010).

3 SOFHNARE

TIBA is implemented in C++ and can be compiled and executed
on the command line in any UNIX—based platform and in the
Cygwin environment on Windows. To run a phylogenetic ana—
lysis, the program must be run with the following input param—
eters: the input filename, the output filename, the reconstruction
method and the bootstrap method. The input file format is the

same as that used by GRAPPA and MGR; FASTA like headers
for the names of the genomes (‘>’ followed by an alphanumeric
sequence followed by a newline), each chromosome represented
by a signed permutation of integers ending with a ‘$’ symbol and
a newline character. The output filename provided by the user is
suffixed with ‘_1’ and ‘_2’ to create two output ﬁles, both in
Newick format; the first contains the inferred tree with branch
lengths, and the second contains the same inferred tree with sup—
port values replacing the branch lengths. The reconstruction
method can be either NJ or FastME. The two bootstrap methods
discussed earlier in the text are implemented. They can be speci—
fied by ‘BC’ or ‘PJ’. The default number of replicates is 100, but
the user can change this with an additional input. Installation
and usage details, with examples, are provided in the package
and on our website.

4 CONCLUSON

TIBA is fast, scalable, accurate and provides support values for
the edges in the inferred tree. Fast and scalable distance—based
methods, precise estimates of true pairwise distances and finally,
for the first time in any rearrangement—based phylogeny infer—
ence method, the use of bootstrap scoresitogether make TIBA
unique.

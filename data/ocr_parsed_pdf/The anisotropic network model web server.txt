Abstract

Summary: The anisotropic network model (ANM) is one of the simplest yet powerful tools for
exploring protein dynamics. Its main utility is to predict and visualize the collective motions of large
complexes and assemblies near their equilibrium structures. The ANM server, introduced by us in
2006 helped making this tool more accessible to non—sophisticated users. We now provide a new
version (ANM 2.0), which allows inclusion of nucleic acids and ligands in the network model and
thus enables the investigation of the collective motions of protein—DNA/RNA and —ligand systems.
The new version offers the flexibility of defining the system nodes and the interaction types and
cutoffs. It also includes extensive improvements in hardware, software and graphical interfaces.
Availability and implementation: ANM 2.0 is available at http://anm.csb.pitt.edu

1 Introduction

The last decade has seen a remarkable increase in the number of
studies that explore biomolecular systems dynamics using coarse—
grained normal mode analysis, prompted by the introduction and es—
tablishment of elastic network models (ENMs). ENMs are efficient
and accurate frameworks for robust predictions of cooperative,
often functional, movements under equilibrium conditions (Bahar
et (11., 2010). More recently the low frequency modes predicted by
ENMs were further shown to be useful in applications that extend
beyond equilibrium motions, such as efficient sampling of conform—
ational space, mapping of trajectories between known states, struc—
ture refinement and molecular docking (see, e.g. Das et (11., 2014;
Eyal et (11., 2011; Hu et (11., 2013; Leis and Zacharias, 2011;
Meireles et (11., 2011; Ostermeir and Zacharias, 2014; Peng et (11.,
2010; Rueda et (11., 2009; Schroder et (11., 2007). A series of web ser—
vers have been developed to assist in the evaluation of normal modes
either at atomic level [e.g. MoViES (Cao et (11., 2004), NOMAD—Ref
(Lindahl et (11., 2006) and NMSim (Kruger et (11., 2012)], or at a
coarse—grained level, often using ENMs [e.g. ElNémo (Suhre and
Sanejouand, 2004), WEBnm@ (Hollup et (11., 2005), iGNM (Yang
et (11., 2005), AD—ENM (http://enm.lobos.nih.gov), and Promode
Elastic (Wako and Endo, 2011)].

Among ENMs, the anisotropic network model (ANM) and
similar residue—based spring—and—node models, introduced 15 years
ago (Atilgan et (11., 2001; Doruker et (11., 2000; Hinsen, 1998;
Sanejouand and Tama, 2001), have found wide applications in
molecular and structural biology due to their simplicity, yet proved
successful for predicting the directions of large—scale functional
motions in accord with experimental observations (Bahar et al.,
2011; Bakan et (11., 2009). Despite the simple theory behind
the model, applying the code and exploring the results require
some knowledge in command line scripting and molecular graphics.
The ANM server, we introduced in 2006 (Eyal et (11., 2006)
was also intended to fill this gap for users with little background in
computational biology. It essentially allowed exploration of
the dynamics in one button click—upon inputting the name of the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) file (or coordinate files in PDB format) of
the structure of interest.

Nine years later, we now present an improved version, ANM
2.0, of the server, which includes, alongside with hardware and soft—
ware upgrades, significant improvement in the functionality and
capabilities of the site, in particular the extension from proteins—
only to biomolecular complexes and assemblies with DNA, RNA
and ligands.

(PDB 3005) is displayed by backbone stick representation (a) as well as network representation (b). Each nucleotide is represented by three nodes in this default
setting, with a uniform 15A cutoff distance. (0) Versatility of the server for defining network nodes and assigning atom-specific interaction ranges. (d) Interactive

2 The ANM 2.0 interface

The most important new feature is the option to now construct net—
work models for structures which include nucleotides and small
molecule/ligands, and thus visualize the collective dynamics of
broader range of bio—molecular structures (Fig. 1a and b). By default
each nucleotide is represented in the network by three nodes, pos—
itioned at the P atom of the phosphate group, C4’ in the base and
C2 in the sugar ring. This model has been shown (Yang et (11., 2006)
to have superior predictive abilities, based on the comparison with

eigenvalue decomposer of ANM version 1.0 can still be used to cal—
culate a fix number (20) of modes as an alternative method.

The server now produces .xyz coordinates file to support the
visualization of vibrations along different directions in Jmol. This
format is simpler and more widely used than the Gamess file which
was in use in the original ANM server. Gamess file is still produced
by the new server and can be downloaded. The new ANM server
also enjoys the many new capabilities developed by Jmol (http://
www.jmol.org) molecular graphics team since the previous version.

and on case studies such as the application of ANM to describe ribo—
somal dynamics (Wang et (11., 2004). The server additionally pro—
vides the option of adopting different numbers of user—defined
atoms for representing the nucleotide nodes. Small ligands can also
be explicitly included in the ANM analysis. Ligands, if present in the

atoms within a defined percentile of the Gaussian distribution.

results. The server also presents static images produced by Raster3D

the number of different atom types. In the simplest case where we
wish a unified threshold distance rc for all atom types, as in the trad—
itional ANM, we simply assign t, : rc /2 for all atom types we would
like to include. The server suggests rc: 15 by default, as a com—
promise between better agreement with isotropic B—factors, obtained
in larger cutoffs (Eyal et (11., 2006) and more realistic anisotropic dis—
placement parameters (ADPs) obtained using lower cutoffs (Eyal
et (11., 2007). The selection of specific and non—standard nodes is tech—
nically done using the ‘advanced input’ page, accessible from the
ANM home page, following the selection of a structure file.

In the new version, the user has the additional option of import—
ing external data, e.g. submitting the principal modes that have been
calculated with another method, and take advantage of the easy and
powerful GUI of the server for visualizing the modes of motions and
the cross—correlations between residue motions. The dimensions of
these uploaded vectors must match the number of system nodes
defined by the user.

Finally, the new server now enjoys 128 GB of RAM which
allows for better performance for analyzing the collective motions
of large molecules. Software versions currently being used are:
Matlab R2014a, Jmol 13.0.16, Raster3D 3.02. Most of the envelope

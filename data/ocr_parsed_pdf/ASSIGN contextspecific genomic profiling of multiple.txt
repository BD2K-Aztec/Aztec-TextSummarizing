Abstract

Motivation: Although gene—expression signature—based biomarkers are often developed for clinical
diagnosis, many promising signatures fail to replicate during validation. One major challenge is
that biological samples used to generate and validate the signature are often from heterogeneous
biological contexts—controlled or in vitro samples may be used to generate the signature, but pa—
tient samples may be used for validation. In addition, systematic technical biases from multiple
genome—profiling platforms often mask true biological variation. Addressing such challenges will
enable us to better elucidate disease mechanisms and provide improved guidance for personalized
therapeutics.

Results: Here, we present a pathway profiling toolkit, Adaptive Signature Selection and
lnteGratioN (ASSIGN), which enables robust and context—specific pathway analyses by efficiently
capturing pathway activity in heterogeneous sets of samples and across profiling technologies.
The ASSIGN framework is based on a flexible Bayesian factor analysis approach that allows for
simultaneous profiling of multiple correlated pathways and for the adaptation of pathway signa—
tures into specific disease. We demonstrate the robustness and versatility of ASSIGN in estimating
pathway activity in simulated data, cell lines perturbed pathways and in primary tissues samples
including The Cancer Genome Atlas breast carcinoma samples and liver samples exposed to geno—
toxic carcinogens.

expression signatures to quantify pathway activation level has been
particularly important for dissecting the complexity of diseases and
providing guidelines of targeted therapeutics. To date, gene expres—
sion—based pathway analyses mainly face two sources of challenges:
(i) limited pathway annotations in curated databases and (ii) inef—
fective analysis tools.

In reference to the first limitation, many public databases
(Ashburner et al., 2000; Kanehisa et al., 2014; Liberzon et al., 2011)
provide manually curated pathways that associate genes lists with
pathway activity. However, genes in those predefined pathways are
not always associated with gene expression changes that differ
between disease states. For example, some genes in an annotated
pathway might be activated through changes in phosphorylation or
protein interaction status. Thus, pathway analysis approaches that
use patient gene expression profiles without careful selection for
expression—based signature genes with transcriptional change
may lead to incorrect results. An alternative way to infer pathway
activity is by experimentally perturbing the pathway of interest in
controlled settings and projecting the associated molecular signature
(e.g. changes in gene expression) onto patient or other target sam—
ples to estimate pathway activity levels (Bild et al., 2006; Gustafson
et al., 2010; Sweet—Cordero et al., 2005). For example, previous
efforts have generated gene expression signatures for growth factor
signaling pathways in human primary cells and then used the signa—
tures to predict disease prognosis and drug sensitivity in human can—
cer cohorts (Bild et al., 2006). Although, these pathway—profiling
approaches have been previously shown to generate empirical gene
expression—based pathway response signatures, the assumption of
homogeneity between in vitro (e.g. perturbation samples) and
in vivo (e.g. patient) biological conditions does not always hold due
to platform, tissue or disease deregulation status variations.

In effort to address the second concern, factor analysis
approaches have been used to identify latent factors (metagenes)
associated with pathways and clinical outcome (Bazot et al., 2013;
Bhattacharya and Dunson, 2011; West, 2003). However, it is often
difficult to interpret the biological meaning of the latent factors
identified by these unsupervised approaches or to estimate the abso—
lute activation level for pathways of interest. Supervised classifica—
tion approaches (Pirooznia et al., 2008) often model pathways one
at a time without accounting for pathway correlation or interaction
between related pathways. Moreover, supervised classification
approaches require expression data from pathway perturbation
experiments for building up models, thus often fail to work when
only pathway gene lists are available. So far, none of these existing
approaches adequately account for tissue, disease or context specifi—
city in assessing gene expression signatures regulated via pathway
activation or deactivation. Furthermore, none of them are designed
to profile genomic signatures across multiple genomic profiling
platforms.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel and ﬂexible
pathway profiling toolkit called Adaptive Signature Selection and
InteGratioN (ASSIGN). ASSIGN relies on a sparse Bayesian factor
analysis method to estimate the activation status of pathways under
investigation, such as oncogenic pathways, immune response path—
ways or drug response pathways in individual samples of a genomic
dataset for predicting optimal treatment prior to any medication on
patients. Here, we use multiple simulated and real datasets to demon—
strate the validity and robustness of ASSIGN in estimating pathway
activation. In simulated data, the model correctly adapts the pathway
signature gene lists in specific biological contexts by excluding
irrelevant genes or including relevant genes into signatures. We used
five previously published oncogenic signaling pathway signatures to

demonstrate the advantages of modeling multiple pathways in concert
to account for crosstalk among the pathways. We also used the tumor
samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to show that
ASSIGN can robustly combine in vitro signatures generated using
one profiling platform with tumor samples profiled using a different
platform. Finally, we used profiling data generated from liver tissues
exposed to genotoxic hepatocarcinogens to demonstrate the versatil—
ity of ASSIGN in identifying and adapting signatures from pre—
curated pathway gene lists. Overall, ASSIGN uses a semi—supervised
approach that results in more biologically interpretable pathway
activation profiles that are adapted to specific tissues or disease con—
texts, as opposed to more rigid and less interpretable profiles gener—
ated by previous approaches. Although, ASSIGN was initially
designed for pathway—based analysis from gene expression data,
it can easily be extended to other profiling data types such as DNA
variation or methylation data.

2 Approach

We define a ‘signature’ as a set of representative genes whose expres—
sion changes due to differences in disease status, exposure to a chem—
ical compound/drug or differential regulation of key pathway genes.
The signature can also optionally contain the absolute direction
changes or expression magnitude changes due to an experimental
perturbation. ASSIGN is a pathway analysis toolkit with the ﬂexibil—
ity to accommodate profiling analysis needs for a large number of
pathways or perturbation profiling scenarios. ASSIGN allows the
user the option of choosing either Bayesian regression (signatures
known) or factor analysis (signatures unknown) and accommodates
multiple signatures simultaneously within a set of samples. Key
innovations in ASSIGN allow for broad applicability of the method
(Table 1), whereas other existing approaches lack one or more of
these critical features. The specific advantages of ASSIGN are
described below.

2.1 Simultaneous profiling of multiple pathways

ASSIGN can account for pathways simultaneously, compared with
other approaches that only consider a single pathway at a time
[GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005), ssGSEA (Barbie et al., 2009),
BFRM (West, 2003)]. This feature accounts for ‘cross—talk’ between
pathway components by directly modeling correlations and inter—
actions in the pathway signature components that might reduce de—
tection sensitivity and specificity.

2.2 Context specificity in baseline gene expression

Baseline gene expression levels (i.e. expression level when a pathway
is inactive) may vary widely due to differences in tissue types or
disease status, or across different measurement platforms and can
contribute to heterogeneity between in vitro perturbation samples
and patient samples. ASSIGN can adaptively estimate background
gene expression levels across a set of samples, giving it the unique
ability to estimate absolute pathway activity levels or drug efficacy in
clinical samples before the samples have received a treatment, even
when the signature was generated using a different profiling platform.

2.3 Context specific signature estimation

Many existing signature—based profiling approaches require input
signatures in the form of a gene list [GSEA, FacPad (Ma and Zhao,
2012)] or a gene list with static expression magnitude changes
(BFRM). While BFRM provides a direct and supervised approach
for pathway profiling, it requires the signature to be generated in the

same biological context as the patient samples. FacPad allows for
the adaptation of signature profiles, but cannot integrate magnitude
change information. In addition, FacPad is highly impacted by out—
liers in the dataset and often suffers from the lack of identifiability
of the direction of the signature magnitude. ASSIGN provides the
ﬂexibility to use either a signature—based or gene list—based approach
and can also use input magnitudes as prior information, thus provid—
ing a compromise that allows for adaptive signature refinement
while reducing signature over—fitting and direction ambiguity.

2.4 Regularization of signature strength estimates
ASSIGN regularizes signature strength estimates using Bayesian
ridge regression (Hsaing, 1975), which ‘shrinks’ signature strength
estimates toward zero, especially for signatures with a weak
presence or anecdotal correlations in the sample. In addition, ridge
regression has well—established benefits in handling correlated
covariates (Hsiang, 1975), thus making it advantageous for the
simultaneous modeling of correlated signatures.

3 Methods
3.1 Formal definition of ASSIGN model

To define the model formally, suppose a gene expression assay pro—
files G genes on N patient samples of a certain disease type, and let
Ybe a G X N matrix of observed expression values. Each entry in Y
is a gene expression value after data normalization. We apply a
Bayesian sparse factor model to decompose the Ymatrix as:

YGXN I BlelllxN + SGXKAKXN + EGXN (1)

Each column of Y represents all the genes for one patient
sample. We model the measured expression values of each
patient sample in a vector form: Y.,,- N N(B+SA.,,-, 2),
where 2 : diag(rl‘1, ... ,151) for/ : 1, ... ,N. Figure 1 contains a
visual representation of the ASSIGN model.

B is a G—vector of the baseline gene expression levels for all
genes. We define the prior distribution of B as B N N013, SB). The
prior parameters MB and SB can be set as non—informative or inform—
ative from control samples in a pathway perturbation experiment.

Matrix S is the G X K factor loading matrix, with each column
representing the gene expression signature of a specific biological
pathway. In whole—genome expression profiling, we expect that the

majority of genes will not show differential expression in associ—
ation with any particular factor, and each individual factor
will be associated with only a few genes. Thus, the columns [2
of S will be sparse. The hierarchical spike—and—slab prior

distribution of S is: Sgt

 

is a Bernoulli—distributed binary indicator for Sgt ((54%;a : 0: the gene
is excluded from the signature; 5g}, : 1: the gene is included in the
signature). 5gp is sampled with probability 1:“. Sgt has a diffuse
prior («)1 : 1) when 5qu : 1, and a highly precise prior (mg 20.1)
when 5g}, : 0. The choice of prior 7'!qu depends on the prior infor—
mation of pathway signatures (see Section 3.2 for details).

Matrix A is the K X N factor score (pathway activity) matrix,
with each column A.,/' representing activation scores of the K path—
ways for each individual patient sample. Since tumors often rely on
the activation of one or two pathways, such as via an ‘oncogene ad—
diction’ (Weinstein, 2002), not all of the K pathways will necessarily
be activated in all the individual patient samples. Therefore, any col—
umn ofA will likely be sparse. Thus, we model the matrix A using a
hierarchical spike—and—slab prior similar to the formulation for S.
To overcome the ‘sign—ﬂipping’ phenomenon (e.g. non—identifiabil—
ity) that commonly occurs in factor analysis, we used a truncated
normal distribution (0, 1 range) in a modified slab normal prior:

y” is a binary variable, indicating whether A” is zero. The binary
indicator y” is assumed to follow a Bernoulli distribution,
with Pro/k”,- : 1) : A”, where 2;”- is a useful parameter that
estimates the probability that Ah,- is assigned to the slab distribution
(i.e. the pathway is activated).

Matrix E is the G X N noise matrix. Each column of E follows a
multivariate normal distribution with mean 0 and a G X G diagonal
covariance matrix 2. The precision of the gm gene 17g is assumed to
follow a Gamma prior with shape parameter u and rate parameter
11. In practice, we use non—informative priors for u and 11.

Based on the settings of prior distributions above and prior par—
ameters (Supplementary Table S1), we computed the full conditional
posterior distribution for each parameter in the model. Since the
prior distributions we use are conjugate for the likelihood functions;
the parameters in B, A, S and E were jointly approximated using
Gibbs sampling. In practice, we observed that 2000 iterations are
sufficient for convergence. To calculate the posterior mean of the
parameters, we ran 2000 iterations until the MCMC chain con—
verged and discarded the first half of values in the chain. Typical
computational time is 80 seconds for a dataset with 22 000 genes
profiled on 100 patient samples.

3.2 Signature gene selection

For gene selection, to set the priors of Sgt and TIM for the matrix S,
we apply a Bayesian variable selection approach (George and
Mcculloch, 1997) to compute prior weights and signal strengths of
genes from the gene expression profiles and use the genes with the
highest signal strengths and weights when estimating pathway acti—
vation status. Brieﬂy, we define Ygﬁkﬁi to be the expression measure—
ment for gene g of pathway [2, and sample /. We assume
Ygﬁkﬁi : ﬂog”), + ﬁlgﬁkXi+egM , where X,- is an indicator variable
denoting perturbation status for sample / (control: 0; treat—
ment: 1), ﬂog”), is the gene—specific background expression level of
pathway k, [31“ is the change in expression due to treatment status,
and egﬁkﬁl- is a Gaussian error term. We place a mixture prior on
[31“: Le. [31“ l kg}: N (1—Vg,k)N(0, 60 %) +Vg,kN(0, 60 1), Where
[31qu has a diffuse prior (co1 : 1) when yqu : 1, and a highly precise
prior (mg 20.1) when ygﬁk :0, where ygﬁk is an indicator variable
that is equal to 1 when the gene is differentially expressed in the
perturbation experiment and 0 otherwise. We assume a priori that it
follows a Bernoulli(1r) distribution, where 1:: 0.01. Genes are
ranked by the posterior mean of [31“ (expression change) and the
posterior probability of ygﬁk (statistical significance), and the top
50—200 genes are selected for the signature (number specified by
user), where Sgt is set to ﬁlﬁkﬁg; TIM is set to ygﬁk. ASSIGN concaten—
ates a set of genes involved in at least one pathway signature for
further profiling.

3.3 Gene expression profiling data

3.3.1 Novel pathway data

To experimentally validate the method, we transfected human
primary mammary epithelial cells in vitro using a recombinant
adenovirus that expresses EGFR, MEK and EGFR+MEK (both
pathways active) as described previously (Bild et al., 2006). After
transfection, total RNA was extracted and purified using a Qiagen
RNeasy kit and sequencing libraries were generated using Illumina
TruSeq stranded mRNA sample preparation kits. The Illumina
Hi—Seq 2000 platform was used to produce single—end reads (50 bp
in length). These data have been deposited in the GEO database
under accession number GSE59765. The EGFR and MEK

pathway RNA—Seq data were combined with PI3K microarray data
(described below) for multi—pathway profiling to validate the
cross—platform feature of ASSIGN.

3.3.2 Existing pathway data

We used data for five oncogenic pathways (li—catenin, E2F3, MYC,
RAS, SRC) (GEO accession: GSE3151) profiled on Affymetrix
HG—U133 Plus 2.0 arrays and PI3K pathway perturbation data
(GSE12815) profiled on HG—U133A microarrays. We also obtained
mRNA expression data for liver tissues from the DrugMatrix
dataset (Ganter et al., 2005; GSE57822) profiled on Affymetrix
Rat 230 2.0 arrays. Each sample corresponds to rat—liver tissue
treated with a different carcinogenic compound, annotated using
the Carcinogenic Potency Database (CPDB) (Fitzpatrick, 2008).
RNA—sequencing counts summarized at the gene level for TCGA
breast carcinomas and tumor adjacent normal tissues were also
downloaded from the TCGA data portal. Details of all the datasets
used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2.

3.4 Data preprocessing and normalization

For the cell line perturbation experiments, the microarray mRNA
expression profiles were preprocessed and normalized using
SCAN.UPC (Piccolo et al., 2012, 2013). The rat liver data were
normalized using fRMA (McCall et al., 2010). The RNA—Seq
cell—line data were aligned to the reference genome using TopHat
v2.0.6 (Trapnell et al., 2009), then quantified to FPKM for each
gene/transcript using Cufﬂinks v2.0.2 (Trapnell et al., 2010). For
the RNA—seq data from TCGA, Level 3 summarized values were
used (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012); reads were mapped to
the reference genome using MapSplice v12_07 (Wang et al., 2010),
read counts were estimated using RSEM v1.1.13 (Li and Dewey,
2011) and RSEM read counts are normalized using upper—quantile
normalization. In these analyses, we intensionally used data that
were preprocessed using different normalization procedures to dem—
onstrate the robustness of ASSIGN’s adaptive profiling approach.
PCA was conducted on the expression profiles to validate that there
were no batch effects. Finally, to evaluate whether batch/platform
effects existed in the TCGA data, we plotted the first two principal
components and observed no obvious clustering by batch/platform
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). As expected, a clear separation of tumor
and normal tissues were observed on the PCA plot (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). To integrate gene expression data across experiments and
platforms, we applied ComBat (Johnson et al., 2007) in two steps,
first to adjust for batch effects within the perturbation experiments
and second to adjust for batch effects across the signature and
patient (e.g. TCGA) datasets.

3.5 Simulation data

We used simulation to generate expression data for four pathways
(25 samples with one of the four pathway perturbed) and
1000 genes (250 genes per pathway). The values of elements in the B
vector were independently simulated from a Uniform (0, 1) distribu—
tion. The values for significant genes in each pathway of S matrix
were simulated independently from a Normal (0, 1) distribution
with a constraint on absolute values greater than 1, and simulated
insignificant genes in the S matrix independently from Normal (0,
0.01). The noise term, E, for each gene was simulated from Normal
(0, 0.5). Yis the summation of B, SA and E. We used this simulation
to evaluate ASSIGN under three scenarios: (i) an ideal scenario
where the predetermined pathway signature exactly represents the
pathway signature in a disease environment, (ii) signature

perturbation experiments that do not fully represent the pathway
signatures in a disease environment and (iii) when one or more of
the pathways are deregulated, thus requiring significant adaptation
of the gene list, signature magnitudes and background expression
profile. Detailed descriptions of data generation and the results are
given in the Supplementary Materials.

3.6 Software implementation and application

ASSIGN is available as a Bioconductor package, written in the R
programming language and is freely available for download at
http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ASSIGN.htrnl.
As input, ASSIGN requires gene expression data from patient/test
samples, and a signature perturbation dataset or signature gene list.
When perturbation data are given, ASSIGN automatically generates
pathway signatures based on the raw gene expression data from one
or more perturbations. When signature perturbation datasets are un—
available, the user can provide predetermined signature gene lists
(e.g. from public databases, prior differential expression experi—
ments). ASSIGN outputs a matrix of signature strengths for each
sample and the prior/posterior signature gene lists and magnitude
changes. The software also provides the user with output from a
complete internal cross—validation on the perturbation data, MCMC
posterior convergence diagnostics and an evaluation of classification
accuracy when patient labels are provided by the user. The user can
specify model parameters/features such as background adaptation,
signature adaptation and regularization of signature strength. The
model specification options for the analyses in this study are listed in
Supplementary Table S3.

4 Results

To overcome challenges from pathway ‘cross—talk’ and heterogen—
eity from biological and technical sources, we developed the
ASSIGN toolkit that allows for ﬂexible profiling of multiple corre—
lated signatures into specific disease, tissue and patient contexts.
Here, we demonstrate the features of ASSIGN using simulation,
cross validation and several publicly available genomic datasets. In
Section 4.1, we use three simulated scenarios to evaluate the model’s
abilities to estimate pathway—activation status and filter irrelevant
genes. In Sections 4.2 and 4.3, we illustrate ASSIGN’s ability to
account for context—specific background levels and to crosstalk
among multiple pathways. In Section 4.4, we evaluate the effective—
ness of ASSIGN to overcome cross—tissue and cross—platform obs—
tacles to estimates pathway activity in a large breast carcinoma
dataset. In Section 4.5, we adapt curated signatures of DNA damage
response pathways to estimate pathway signature strength in liver
profiling samples. In these sections we compare ASSIGN in multiple
contexts with existing methods such as GSEA, ssGSEA, BFRM and
FacPad and demonstrate a general advantage of ASSIGN over these
existing approaches.

4.1 Simulation studies

We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the performance of
ASSIGN under three scenarios to test the ability of ASSIGN to ef—
fectively estimate background, signature and activity profiles.
Details regarding data generation for each scenario are given in
Supplementary Materials. In the first simulation scenario, we eval—
uated ASSIGN’s ability to estimate a pathway’s activity when path—
way signatures are known a priori. ASSIGN accurately estimated
the activation level of the pathways (Supplementary Table S4A). In
the second simulation scenario, we attempted to estimate signatures

obtained from pathway perturbation experiments that require con—
text—specific adaptation. ASSIGN was able to closely estimate the
posterior mean of the activation levels and accurately estimate the
correct posterior means of the background and the signature
(Supplementary Table S4B). Here, we observed that 91% of the
insignificant genes and 98% of the significant genes were respect—
ively dropped from or added to the posterior (Supplementary
Fig. S2). In the third simulated scenario, we showed that ASSIGN
was capable of detecting more than one activated pathway
(Supplementary Table S4C). Furthermore, we discovered that know—
ledge of the regulation status of only 10 genes out of 250 total
significant genes was sufficient to overcome the sign—ﬂipping issue
and correctly estimate a pathway activation status.

4.2 Profiling of interconnected oncogenic pathways
Many pathway analysis methods use a single—pathway approach
where the pathways are profiled independently. However, because
pathways interact with each other as part of complex biological sys—
tems, analyzing multiple pathways simultaneously provides better in—
sight into pathway function and activity. We validated our multiple—
pathway—based model by predicting activity of five previously pub—
lished oncogenic pathways (li—catenin, E2F3, MYC, RAS, SRC) in
human cell lines (Bild et al., 2006). In these signatures, about 17% of
the genes exhibit significant expression changes in more than one
pathway and also exhibit high correlation across the pathway gene
expression signatures (Supplementary Table S5). We used ASSIGN to
estimate pathway activity profiles for all five pathway sets via cross
validation. ASSIGN consistently predicted pathway activity profiles
accurately in all of these samples (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the single—
pathway BFRM approach (West, 2003) and FacPad incorrectly esti—
mated pathway activity profiles for four of the five pathways (Fig.
2B, C). Consequently, the false—positive pathway activation profiles
from these approaches could interfere with clinical decisions for se—
lecting the appropriate targeted therapies for cancer patients.

4.3 Adapting background levels across heterogeneous
samples

To further evaluate the importance of correcting for context—specific
baseline expression levels, we estimated pathway activity for the
EGFR and MEK co—activated RNA—Seq samples using the EGFR
and MEK pathway signatures profiled using RNA—Seq. We also
included a previously published PI3K signature that was generated
in a different cell type (lung epithelial cells compared with mammary
epithelial cells) using a microarray profiling technology. To validate
the adaptive background feature of ASSIGN, we compared three
ASSIGN model settings: (i) background (i.e. expression levels when
no pathways are active) fixed to the observed values in the control
samples of the EGFR/MEK pathway coactivated experiment; (ii)
background fixed to the value in the control samples of the PI3K
activation experiment; (iii) background fixed as in (ii) but allowing
for ASSIGN background estimation. We observed that the pathway
activation level was correctly estimated in model (i), which included
the correct background and (iii) with the ASSIGN adapted back—
ground, but not in (ii) with a non—adaptive incorrect background
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The posterior mean of B estimated in
model (iii) converged almost exactly to the true values (Cor. : 0.99),
whereas the background values used in model (ii) deviate from
the true values (Cor.:0.60). Thus, the ASSIGN model (iii) with
adaptive background correctly estimates EGFR and MEK pathway
activity in EGFR and MEK co—activated samples even when the
background is unknown (Fig. 3). In these samples, we observed that

Fig. 2. Oncogenic pathway activity prediction via cross-validation. Predicted
pathway activity for (A) ASSIGN, (B) BFRM and (C) FacPad. Activation levels
of two oncogenic pathways (Bcat, Src) were estimated for cell lines with one
of five pathways activated (ﬁ-catenin, E2F3, MYC, RAS, SRC). The ASSIGN
and BFRM values range between zero (inactive pathway) and one (active
pathway). FacPad was designed for relative pathway activation comparisons
and activation levels can range from negative infinity to infinity

the EGFR signature is strong in the EGFR—only samples and the
MEK signature is strong in the MEK—only samples. Both EGFR and
MEK are upregulated in the EGFR+MEK samples, with EGFR sig—
nal being overall lower, potentially due to stronger negative feed—
back on the pathway with concurrent activation of EGFR and MEK
(Avraham and Yarden, 2011; Klinger et al., 2013). For the sake of
comparison across methods, we applied the FacPad and BFRM
methods to these scenarios. FacPad requires a baseline level for each
sample and takes the ratio of treated samples and control samples as
input. When true baseline information of the EGFR and MEK coac—
tivated samples was not available, FacPad failed to estimate the
correct pathway activation level (Fig. 3). BFRM correctly estimated
the EGFR and MEK pathways in the EGFR and MEK coactivated
samples when the background in the patient samples perfectly
matched the training samples, albeit slightly less significantly than
ASSIGN. However, BFRM does not adjust for the background
expression level across platforms, and thus estimated elevated PI3K
levels in the EGFR and MEK samples (Fig. 3).

4.4 Cross—platform and cross—tissue pathway profiling

We examined activity levels for our RNA—seq based EGFR and
MEK pathways combined with a previously published PI3K signa—
ture generated on a different cell type and on a microarray profiling
technology. We used ASSIGN to estimate pathway activation status
in RNA—seq data from breast carcinomas and matched adjacent nor—
mal breast samples from TCGA. In addition, we compared pathway
activation in the breast carcinomas based on four molecular sub—
types: basal—like, luminal A, luminal B and Her2 (Supplementary

Fig. 3. Pathway activity prediction using cross-platform generated pathway
signatures. Comparison of ASSIGN, BFRM and FacPad predicted EGFR (A),
MEK (B) and PI3K (C) pathway activity in EGFR, MEK and EGFR+MEK acti-
vated RNA-Seq samples. EGFR and MEK pathway signatures were profiled
via RNA-Seq, whereas PI3K pathway signature was profiled via microarray.
ASSIGN detected two pathways (EGFR and MEK) activated at the same time
in the EGFR+MEK samples and correctly predicted that the PI3K pathway
was inactive, whereas BFRM and FacPad estimated PI3K pathway activation
incorrectly. FacPad also estimated active pathways as inactive and inactive
pathways as active (so called ‘sign-flipping'. See Section 3)

Fig. S4). For all three pathways, ASSIGN consistently found known
pathway—molecular subtype relationships confirmed by other studies
and outperformed BFRM and FacPad (Cheang et al., 2008; Hoeflich
et al., 2009; Lopez—Knowles et al., 2010; Moestue et al., 2013). All
approaches estimated significantly higher EGFR activity in tumor
samples in general as well as in all four subtypes of breast cancer
compared with normal tissue (Table 2A). ASSIGN correctly pre—
dicted MEK activity to be higher in the basal—like subtype and PI3K
activity to be higher both in basal—like and Her2 subtype than nor—
mal tissues (Table 2B, C). BFRM failed to recognize higher MEK ac—
tivity and higher PI3K activity in basal—like subtypes (Table 2B, C).
FacPad incorrectly predicted MEK activities to be significantly lower
than normal tissue (Table 2B; Supplementary Fig. S4).

4.5 Context—specific signature predictions in individual
samples

To evaluate ASSIGN’s signature adaptation features and single sam—
ple prediction abilities, we investigated pathway activation status in
liver samples from Rattus norvegicus exposed to genotoxic or
non—genotoxic carcinogens. We estimated how well we could use
curated pathway signatures from existing databases to predict geno—
toxicity of the carcinogenic compounds. For validation purpose,
we used the outcome of an Ames Salmonella test as a proxy for
genotoxicity (Mortelmans and Zeiger, 2000) available through
CPDB (Fitzpatrick, 2008) for the carcinogenic compounds under con—
sideration. In this study, we focused on the association of the activity

level of DNA damage response/repair pathways with genotoxic car—
cinogen exposures. Among DNA damage responsejrepair pathways
from the MSigDB database, 9 pathways were identified as differen—
tially activated between the two groups (genotoxic versus non—geno—
toxic) by at least two of four approaches: ASSIGN, GSEA, ssGSEA
and FacPad (Table 3). BFRM was not included in this analysis be—
cause it requires gene expression proﬁling data from pathway per—
turbation experiments to train its model (these are not available here).
We applied GSEA, ssGSEA and FacPad to test the enrichment of
DNA damagejrepair pathways in genotoxic group and to validate

ASSIGN predictions. FacPad yielded results largely inconsistent with
the other methods; FacPad often produced mean differences between
two groups that were in opposite directions than the other
approaches. Although GSEA and ssGSEA approaches yielded results
similar to ASSIGN, we note that ASSIGN did not require genotoxic
status to estimate the pathway activation level. Furthermore, in con—
trast to GSEA, ssGSEA and FacPad, ASSIGN is able to estimate abso—
lute pathway activity for each individual sample (Supplementary
Table S6). ssGSEA outputs an enrichment score for each sample, but
this score is on a relative (not absolute) scale. Therefore, pathway en—
richment/activation can only be determined in contexts containing
multiple control samples (Supplementary Table S7). The ASSIGN pre—
dictions of genotoxic carcinogen exposure using the KEGG P53 sig—
naling pathway in rat samples closely matched the genotoxicity labels
from the bacterial assays with AUC : 0.91 (Figure 4—A and 4—B).

4.5. 1 Context-specific signatures

We further examined the adaptive pathway KEGG P5 3 signature
estimated by ASSIGN. The predefined signature of the KEGG P5 3
signaling pathway from MSigDB is a curated gene set for Homo
sapiens. ASSIGN adapts this signature to R. norvegicus when
predicting the pathway activity level in rat samples. For the adaptive
signature of this pathway, we observed that 65% of the genes in the
KEGG P5 3 signaling pathway were dropped out from the significant
gene list (posterior probability <0.90) (Supplementary Table S7).
In addition, for the genes retained in the list, although the magnitude
of gene expression level is not provided in the predefined signature, it
was estimated and adapted to the rat samples (Supplementary Table
S7). We plotted a heatmap, ordering the samples by the activity level
of the context—specific R. norvegicus KEGG P5 3 signaling pathway.
The gene expression profiles of those 36 rat samples were naturally
clustered by pathway activity predicted by ASSIGN (Fig. 4C).

5 Conclusions and Discussion

We have developed the ASSIGN approach for simultaneously
determining the strengths of multiple molecular signatures in patient
samples. Our ASSIGN framework is specifically designed for cases
where the signatures or relevant signature gene lists are known
a priori. ASSIGN does not accommodate situations where signatures
are completely unknown. ASSIGN uses sparse Bayesian regression
and factor analysis approaches to simultaneously profile multiple
pathway signatures. ASSIGN is a ﬂexible toolkit that allows for sig—
natures in the form of gene sets, gene sets with direction and magni—
tudes or signatures extracted directly from profiling data. ASSIGN
also allows for adapting the background and the signatures to better
accommodate specific tissues, biological systems or disease contexts.

We have demonstrated the usefulness of our approach in mul—
tiple simulated and real—data examples and showed that ASSIGN
performs favorably in these datasets compared with other existing
approaches. For example, because ASSIGN evaluates multiple path—
way signatures simultaneously, it accounts for confounding events
between interactive pathways. Here, we applied ASSIGN to five
highly correlated oncogenic pathways and compared results with
BFRM, a single pathway—based approach. Although, BFRM
achieves similar sensitivity to ASSIGN, BFRM has much lower spe—
cificity. In addition, ASSIGN can use either curated pathway signa—
ture gene lists or perturbation signatures in a ﬂexible way. Most
supervised learning methods, such as BFRM, require perturbation
datasets as input. GSEA and FacPad can only use curated pathway
gene lists. For pathway signature profiling, the selection of multiple
pathways is based on the biological knowledge of pathway

interaction. However, we recommend a maximum of about a dozen
of correlated pathways in ASSIGN to avoid multicollinearity and
unidentifiability issues of the model.

The adaptive background feature of ASSIGN allows for the esti—
mation of absolute pathway activity levels in a biologically interpret—
able manner (ranging between 0 and 1). No existing factor analysis
approach or supervised learning approach accommodates this feature,
and thus can only achieve relative activation status. The enrichment
scores estimated by ssGSEA do not have biological meaning unless
compared with control samples for relative pathway strength. GSEA
estimates one overall enrichment score, but does not predict for indi—
vidual samples. Furthermore, ASSIGN allows for the refinement and
adaptation of pathway signatures within a dataset, in contrast to
other regression—based or supervised learning algorithms in which the
predetermined pathway signature is static (Pirooznia et al., 2008;
Ringner et al., 2002). This unique feature not only reduces the bias of
pathway strength estimation, but also curates pathway signatures to
be cell— or tissue—specific future applications.

In addition to pathway activation level estimation, ASSIGN can
be used to predict patients’ drug response, carcinogen exposure,
pathogen immune response on the basis of gene expression signature
strength. The input data of ASSIGN is assumed to follow a normal
distribution. To accommodate to different types of omic data such as
methylation microarray data or SNP array data, a more generalized
model may need to be developed in the future. In addition, in future
work we plan to allow for multiple background profiles in the patient
dataset, whereas the current version of ASSIGN only allows for a sin—
gle baseline expression profile. We also hope to evaluate extensions of
ASSIGN to integrate multi—omic data types and to better accommo—
date the discrete nature of sequencing data. Overall, ASSIGN results
in more biologically interpretable pathway activation profiles that are
adapted to specific tissues or disease contexts, as opposed to more
rigid and less interpretable profiles from previous approaches.

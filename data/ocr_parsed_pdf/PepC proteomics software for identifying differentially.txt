ABSTRACT

Summary: Identifying biologically significant changes in protein
abundance between two conditions is a key issue when analyzing
proteomic data. One widely used approach centers on spectral
counting, a label-free method that sums all the tandem mass spectra
for a protein observed in an analysis. To assess the significance
of the results, we recently combined the t-test and G-test, with
random permutation analysis, and we validated this approach
biochemically. To automate the statistical method, we developed
PepC, a software program that balances the trade-off between
the number of differentially expressed proteins identified and the
false discovery rate. This tool can be applied to a wide range of
proteomic datasets, making data analysis rapid, reproducible and
easily interpretable by proteomics specialists and non-specialists
alike.

Availability and implementation: The software is implemented
in Java. It has been added to the Trans Proteomic Pipeline
project’s ‘Petunia’ web interface, but can also be run as a
command line program. The source code is GNU Lesser General

1 INTRODUCTION

Two important objectives of proteomics—global assessment
of protein expression levels and biomarker discovery—depend
critically on measuring relative protein abundance. Mass
spectrometry (MS) has emerged as the leading technology for this
purpose because it is easily applied to high-throughput analyses
and provides broad coverage of the proteome (Abersold and Mann,
2003; Sadygov et (11., 2004). A potential limitation is that results
are generally semiquantitative (Mason and Liebler, 2003). Isotope
labeling of peptides has been developed to circumvent this problem.
Labeling methods are expensive and limited in the number of
samples that can be coordinately interrogated, making application
to samples from large-scale clinical studies difﬁcult.

Spectral counting and peptide ion intensity are alternative,
label-free methods for quantifying relative protein abundance
(Bondarenko et (11., 2002; Liu et (11., 2004; Old et (11., 2005; Wiener
et (11., 2004). Spectral counting sums all MS/MS spectra observed for

peptides derived from a single protein. Because abundant proteins
are more likely to be identiﬁed during data-dependent MS/MS
scanning, spectral counting has the potential to quantify protein
levels. Indeed, studies have shown strong correlations between
relative protein abundance, as assessed by peptide ion intensities
and spectral counting (Bondarenko et (11., 2002; Liu et (11., 2004;
Old et (11., 2005). More recent studies have shown that the accuracy
of spectral counting can be improved by normalization methods
such as correction for sampling depth, protein molecular weight or
number of tryptic peptides expected (reviewed in Zhu et (11., 2010).

A variety of statistical approaches have been developed to assess
differences in spectral counts (Choi et (11., 2008; Fu et (11., 2008; Old
et (11., 2005; Pavelka et (11., 2008; Zhang et (11., 2006). However, a
key issue is correcting for multiple comparisons. Overly stringent
signiﬁcance cutoffs identify few differentially expressed proteins,
while looser criteria identify more proteins at the expense of
increased false discovery rates (FDRs). Therefore, the development
of rigorous statistical strategies that maximize the identiﬁcation of
signiﬁcant differences in protein expression while minimizing the
FDR is of critical importance in proteomics.

We recently developed a novel method for identifying statistically
signiﬁcant differences in protein abundance based on spectral
counting, and validated our results biochemically. We then used this
approach to identify an atherogenic protein network in macrophages
(Becker et (11., 2010). In this application note, we describe freely
accessible software, PepC, for automating our approach.

2 METHODS

Our method implements two widely used statistical tests for analyzing
proteomics data: the t-test and G-test. Moreover. it combines the signiﬁcance
eutoﬁ‘s from the two tests so that each one’s stringency can be lowered without
inﬂating the FDR. The method is successful because the t-test and G-test
scrutinize proteomic data in different ways. Thus. the G—test (Sokhal and
Rholf. 1994). a likelihood ratio based on a X2 distribution with one degree
of freedom. determines the conﬁdence level primarily from the magnitude
of the difference in spectral counts. The t—test. which assumes that spectral
count measurements are normally distributed. emphasizes the reproducibility
of spectral counts. An analogous approach widely used to analyze microarray
data. supplements t-test signiﬁcance cutoffs with fold change requirements
to ensure high conﬁdence when exploring changes in gene expression (Cui
and Churchill. 2003).

PepC automates the detection of differentially expressed proteins based on
a matrix of different t-test and G-test conﬁdence intervals. It also empirically
calculates the FDR for each combination within the matrix by random
permutation analysis (Benjamini and Hochberg. 1995). The conﬁdence
intervals for the two tests are then optimized to maximize the detection of
differentially abundant proteins at any given user-deﬁned FDR. The program

proteins that were isolated from media of macrophages of low density
lipoprotein receptor-deﬁcient (La'lr—P) mice on a low-fat (chow) or high-fat
(Western) diet (Becker et al.. 2010). The slider control (right edge of panel)
is set to yield a maximum FDR of 10%. The heatmap displays combinations
of t-test (y-axis. P-Value) and G-test (Jr-axis. G-statistic) conﬁdence intervals
that meet this condition (FDR 510%). Its color scale (yellow: most.
black=least) indicates the number of proteins whose abundances differ
signiﬁcantly between the two groups. When a box is selected (in this case.
G-statistic 30.75 and P-Value 50.04). the number of proteins identiﬁed and
the expected false positives are shown in the dialog directly beneath the
heatmap. The individual proteins and their respective statistical parameters
are displayed in the window at the bottom of the screen.

requires at least three independent values per condition; however. we ﬁnd
that higher replicate numbers make FDR estimation more reliable.

PepC is implemented in Java. enabling use in any operating system.
It supports two different types of user interaction. It can act as a
straightforward command line application that performs calculations and
presents a JFreeChart-based graphical user interface for exploration of the
results. Alternatively. a web server module (PepcView) that performs the
calculations uses JSON to send its results to a GWT-based web client for
interactive exploration by the user. The latter mode is integrated with the
Trans Proteomic Pipeline (TPP). a widely used proteomic analysis tool.

3 RESULTS

PepC is a tool for identifying differentially expressed proteins based
on spectral count measurements in MS/MS studies. Input data for
the program can be (i) ProtXML ﬁles that are introduced directly
in TPP or (ii) spreadsheets (in csv ﬁle format) corresponding to
spectral counts extracted from ProtXML ﬁles. We recommend the
latter as it allows the user to curate ProtXML ﬁles to minimize
problems associated with detecting multiple identiﬁers for the same
protein (e.g. International Protein Index). Moreover, it enables
implementation of spectral counting normalization methods prior
to data analysis with PepC.

After the data are uploaded, PepC calculates the G-statistic
(G-test) and P-value (t-test) for each protein in the biological
comparison (group A versus B) and in the randomly permuted
data. These measurements are subsequently used to quantify the
number of proteins identiﬁed (presented as a heatmap) and the
FDR at each combination of conﬁdence intervals (Fig. 1). Using the
slider control or Max FDR dialog box, the user sets the maximum
FDR desired. PepC eliminates signiﬁcance cutoffs with FDRs that
exceed this value and resets the heatmap to display the combination
of G-statistic and P-value that yields the maximal number of
differentially expressed proteins (colored yellow). In this manner,
the user can monitor the trade-off between the number of proteins
identiﬁed and the FDR. Proteins that pass the chosen signiﬁcance
criteria are listed in the bottom panel along with their respective
average spectral counts and statistical parameters.

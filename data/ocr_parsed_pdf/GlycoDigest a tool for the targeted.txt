ABSTRACT

Summary: Sequencing oligosaccharides by exoglycosidases, either
sequentially or in an array format, is a powerful tool to unambiguously
determine the structure of complex N— and O-link glycans. Here, we
introduce GlycoDigest, a tool that simulates exoglycosidase digestion,
based on controlled rules acquired from expert knowledge and ex-
perimental evidence available in GlycoBase. The tool allows the tar-
geted design of glycosidase enzyme mixtures by allowing researchers
to model the action of exoglycosidases, thereby validating and im-
proving the efficiency and accuracy of glycan analysis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein glycosylation plays a key role in a wide range of biolo-
gical processes. Advances in glycansequencing technology show
that glycoproteins and glycolipids exist in many glycosylated
variants, or glycoforms, which can differ substantially in their
biochemical properties and functions. Glycans are structurally
diverse, incorporating a wide range of monosaccharide residues
and glycosidic linkages. Given that protein glycosylation is
involved in numerous cellular processes and is implicated in dis-
ease progression, the ability to accurately characterize glycan
structures and substructures and the determination of the func-
tion of these modiﬁcations, is increasingly important. However,
the difﬁculty associated with oligosaccharide sequencing has re-
sulted in researchers using only their knowledge of the biosyn-
thetic pathways for protein glycosylation to report proposed
glycan structures.

Various analytical platforms are available for the sensitive and
efﬁcient analysis of N— and O-glycans. Such strategies include
chromatographic and electrophoretic separations (with ﬂuores-
cence detection), mass spectrometry (MS) and a combination of
both. However, each particular methodology has its strengths
and weaknesses, especially in terms of the information content

(structural features) that can be readily measured. For example,
limitations in material, the lack of fragments and resolution/
separation of peaks may yield only partial structures whereby
the linkage, the identity or sequence of residue(s) cannot be
fully identiﬁed. The use of orthogonal methodologies for struc-
tural and functional glycomics overcomes these constraints but
often necessitates the integration of results from multiple com-
plementary tools.

1.1 Exoglycosidase digestions of oligosaccharides

One of the most commonly used methods for determining the
sequence and structure of oligosaccharides is the enzymatic ana-
lysis of oligosaccharides using highly speciﬁc exoglycosidases,
either sequentially or in array form. Enzymatic methods have
the ability to determine, in many cases unambiguously, full
and accurate sequence and linkage information. As described
by (Kobata, 1979), they are highly speciﬁc to anomeric conﬁg-
uration and often to monosaccharide type and linkage. Some are
also specific to other structural features, such as local and distant
saccharide branching. This approach has been extensively re-
ported for analysis of ﬁuorescently labeled N—linked oligosac-
charides (and to a lesser degree for O-links) in which treatment
with known enzymatic speciﬁcities, followed by chromato-
graphic separation and observation of shifts in retention time,
is used to validate individual glycan structural features (Guile
et al., 1996). Furthermore, exoglycosidases combined with MS
have been demonstrated to be effective for yielding structural
information (Ali et al., 2012).

GlycoDigest is a tool that simulates the action of these en-
zymes on released oligosaccharides. It has been developed to
assist glycobiologists design mixtures of exoglycosidases that
can be used to guide the precise determination of glycan
structures.

2 DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

GlycoDigest is available in three formats: (i) stand-alone Java
application, (ii) web-based Java applet (http://glycodigest.org/
digest.html) and (iii) an integrated feature of UniCarbKB
(http://unicarbkb.org/glycodigest) and GlycoBase databases;
links are provided for each fully deﬁned structure. The applica-
tion is written in Java 7.0, and the source code is available at

https://bitbucket.org/sib-pig. The stand-alone version is a Swing-
based application built with the MigLayout layout manager,
which can be run on all operating systems. GlycoDigest is avail-
able as a Java library that is integrated with UniCarbKB, allow-
ing users to theoretically digest N— and 0-linked glycan structures
stored in this curated database. GlycanBuilder (Damerell et al.,
2012) acts as the interface for all GlycoDigest variants, allowing
users to create structures by sequentially adding monosacchar-
ides, modiﬁcations or reducing-end markers. The application in-
tegrates libraries developed by EUROCarbDB and GlycomeDB
including universal formats for encoding of glycan structures
(Campbell et al., 2014a).

3 EXOG LYCOSIDASE KNOWLEDGEBASE

Careful preparation and formulation of exoglycosidase arrays is
critical to accurate glycan structural assignments, and strategies
for designing digestions are detailed (Royle et al., 2006). Because
of the structural complexity of glycans, i.e. degree of branching
and steric hindrance, the sequencing of particular motifs is often
dependent upon the correct combination of exoglycosidases. For
example, the Fuc(a1-3) residue of the Lewis x epitope can only
be cleaved after treatment with ﬂ-galactosidase. Knowledge
of exoglycosidase reactions has been acquired by extensive
analytical experience and the creation of suitable experimental
databases. GlycoBase is an High Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) retention time database of experimen-
tally characterized glycan structures, which provides comprehen-
sive information on known exoglycosidase digestions (Campbell
et al., 2008). This wealth of information builds upon the methods
used by the reagent array analysis method (Prime and Merry,
1998). From this base, the rules included in GlycoDigest are
experimental observations on the behavior and mode of action
of exoglycosidases.

4 USING GLYCODIGEST
4.1 GlycoDigest desktop application

The stand-alone release offers a user-friendly interface consisting
of three components: (i) glycan sequences can be directly entered
into the ‘load’ panel in genuine or Consortium for Functional
Glycomics (CFG) modiﬁed, International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) condensed or GlycoCT format,
or built using the embedded version of GlycanBuilder; (ii) a
combination of exoglycosidase enzymes can be selected from
the middle panel, and the input structure is processed in silico
using the rules explained above; (iii) the theoretical results of the
enzymatic digestion are returned in GlycoCT format and dis-
played in the ‘Simulation Results’ panel (Fig. 1). Graphical rep-
resentations of the glycan structures can be displayed using the
image rendering Application Programming Interface (API),
which are linked to UniCarbKB entries.

4.2 GlycoDigest web version

A Java applet version of GlycoDigest uses the same functionality
and interface described above. However, the structure encoding
entries in Panels 1 and 3 are displayed in the same page as

      

a GlycoDigest

opposed to being displayed in new windows. As the stand-alone
version, known structures are linked to UniCarbKB entries.

4.3 Integrating GlycoDigest with UniCarbKB

UniCarbKB offers public access to a growing, curated database
of information on the glycan structures on glycoproteins. For
each N— and 0-link glycan structure with deﬁned linkage infor-
mation, a ‘GlycoDigest’ link provides users the option to select a
combination of enzymes for simulating exoglycosidase treat-
ment(s). Proposed structures for each undigested and digested
glycan resulting from the action of the exoglycosidases can be
searched in UniCarbKB (Campbell et al., 2014b) for associated
published and experimental information, and for combined exo-
glycosidase-MS/MS characterization of oligosaccharides (Ali
et al., 2012) using UniCarb-DB spectra (Hayes et al., 2011).
Alternatively, digestions can be run on structures built using
GlycanBuilder.

5 CONCLUSIONS

GlycoDigest fills the need for a robust and intuitive means for
glycobiologists to simulate and design mixtures of exoglycosi-
dases with which to experimentally validate proposed glycan
structures. The tool minimizes any chance of user bias in inter-
preting what may be ambiguous results and ensures that all
structures compatible with the experimental data are considered.
The availability of the GlycoDigest Java library will allow bioin-
formaticians the option of integrating this tool for managing the
input and output of exoglycosidase-treated glycan structures.

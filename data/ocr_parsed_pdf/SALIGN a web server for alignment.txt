ABSTRACT

Summary: Accurate alignment of protein sequences and/or
structures is crucial for many biological analyses, including
functional annotation of proteins, classifying protein sequences into
families, and comparative protein structure modeling. Described
here is a web interface to SALIGN, the versatile protein multiple
sequence/structure alignment module of MODELLER. The web
server automatically determines the best alignment procedure based
on the inputs, while allowing the user to override default parameter
values. Multiple alignments are guided by a dendrogram computed
from a matrix of all pairwise alignment scores. When aligning
sequences to structures, SALIGN uses structural environment
information to place gaps optimally. If two multiple sequence
alignments of related proteins are input to the server, a profile—
profile alignment is performed. All features of the server have
been previously optimized for accuracy, especially in the contexts
of comparative modeling and identification of interacting protein
partners.

Availability: The SALIGN web server is freely accessible to the
academic community at http://salilab.org/salign. SALIGN is a module
of the MODELLER software, also freely available to academic users
(http://salilaborg/modeller).

1 INTRODUCTION

As part of our effort to better understand cellular processes, we
annotate the functions of proteins, classify them into families,
determine or model their 3D structures, categorize these structures,
etc. To achieve these aims, robust and accurate methods for aligning
protein sequences and structures with one another are essential.
Alignment methods can be divided into three categories based on the
information used to align proteins: sequence—sequence, sequence—
structure, and structure—structure alignments. The SALIGN web
server is designed to provide a user-friendly interface to producing
robust and accurate solutions for the alignment problems in these
different categories. Although several programs and servers (e.g. Di

Tommaso et (11., 2011; Shatsky et al., 2004) align protein sequences
or protein structures with one another, SALIGN can align sequences,
structures, or a combination of sequences and structures.

2 PROGRAM OVERVIEW

The multi-purpose alignment module of MODELLER (Sali and
Blundell, 1993), SALIGN (Madhusudhan, et al., 2006; 2009; Marti-
Renom et al., 2004; Pieper et al., 2011), can produce alignments
of two or more protein sequences, based on sequence and/or
structure information. Given a set of input protein sequences and/or
structures, all possible pairwise alignments are calculated using
dynamic programming.

SALIGN provides two methods for constructing multiple
alignments from pairwise alignments, ‘tree alignment’ and
‘progressive alignment’ (Madhusudhan et al., 2009). The tree
algorithm ﬁrst creates a dendrogram of the input proteins from a
matrix of all pairwise alignment scores. This guides the multiple
alignment by serially aligning, in pairwise fashion, the closest linked
branches to each other. The progressive alignment algorithm is
computationally less expensive, where two arbitrary sequences are
ﬁrst aligned to one another, followed by the addition of a third; in
n-1 steps, a multiple alignment of 11 sequences is created.

If two pre-aligned blocks of sequences are to be aligned, the
proﬁle—proﬁle alignment method is used (Marti-Renom et al., 2004).
To align a block of sequences to a block of structures, the ALIGN2D
algorithm is used, where afﬁne gap penalties are replaced by an
environment-dependent gap penalty function (Madhusudhan et al.,
2006).

SALIGN’s default settings sufﬁce for many applications. It has
been ﬁne tuned and extensively tested for alignment accuracy (Davis
et al., 2006; Madhusudhan et al., 2006; 2009; Marti-Renom et al.,
2004; 2007; Pieper et al., 2011). Nevertheless, the interface allows
the user to manipulate many options if so desired.

3 SERVER DESCRIPTION

The main interface to the server allows the user to input protein
structures and/or sequences. Structures can be uploaded in protein
data bank (PDB) format or speciﬁed by their four-letter PDB codes.
Sequences can be uploaded as ﬁles in the FASTA or MODELLER

Fig. 1. A snapshot of the web server input (A) and results page (B). A link from the results page for structureistructure alignments launches the Chimera
software (Pettersen et al., 2004) for Visual display (C). In this illustration, the proteins identiﬁed by the PDB codes luuaA, 2kntA, and 1bunB are structurally

aligned.

Protein Information Resource (PIR) format, or pasted into the
sequence window. Alignment ﬁles in the MODELLER PIR format
can also be used to specify the input structures; the server searches
the PDB for the structures denoted in the alignment ﬁle. In the event
no structure is found matching an alignment entry, it is treated as a
sequence.

Given the input, the server decides upon the optimal alignment
protocol. If structures were input, the user has the option of
specifying a structure segment (e.g. a single chain or domain).
Further, on the advanced View page, the user can override the default
alignment protocol and parameter values. The parameters that can
be tweaked depend on the selected alignment protocol. For instance,
if a structure—sequence alignment is chosen, parameters related to
the environment-dependent gap penalty ﬁinction can be changed.
An explanation for each of the tunable parameters is provided in the
help pages or via links to the MODELLER manual.

After the successful completion of an alignment task, the user is
e-mailed a link to an archive of output ﬁles. The archive contains
the ﬁnal alignment ﬁle, superimposed coordinates if structures
were aligned, a dendrogram ﬁle if a tree was constructed, and the
MODELLER input and log ﬁles. The input ﬁle(s) can be used
with a standalone version of MODELLER (version 9 or higher).
The log ﬁle contains information about the calculation, including
root mean square deviation values, numbers of equivalent positions,
and any warnings and errors. If structures have been aligned, the
output page also includes a link that displays the aligned structures
in the molecular graphics viewer Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004).
This functionality provides an instant visualization of the alignment
(Fig. 1).

(Sumner et al., 2007). The majority of experimental data reported
in the literature has been collected in positive ion mode, which is
reﬂected in the database. Also, the amount of MS/MS data for
contaminants is currently rather limited. However, the database
has the capability to store this type of data as more is recorded
by the community. As such, and to the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst publicly accessible, readily searchable, readily
implementable into an automated computational pipeline, read—
ily expandable database of mass spectral contaminants.
A summary of the MaConDa features:

0 Database access via SOAP web service;

0 Database access via a user—friendly browser Web interface;
0 Batch processing of peak lists;

0 Searching of contaminants using additional ion forms;

0 Exporting results into different formats (e.g. tab—delimited
and CSV);

0 Multiple database identiﬁers (e.g. PubChem Compound
Identiﬁer and Standard InChI code) for each contaminant
to allow cross—referencing with other resources or databases;

0 The total database is freely available in several formats
(e.g. tab—delimited, CSV, XML and SQL format).

4 CONCLUSIONS

MaConDa is an extensive manually well—annotated database
that provides a useful and unique resource for the MS commu—
nity. Analytical techniques used in metabolomics and proteomics

are continually enhanced to improve their sensitivity. As a result,
new contaminants are introduced into the experimental pipeline.
Continued input of these new contaminants from the MS com—
munity and our own laboratory will enhance MaConDa as a
valuable resource.

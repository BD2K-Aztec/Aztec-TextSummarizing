Abstract

Motivation: To understand the dynamic nature of the biological process, it is crucial to identify per—
turbed pathways in an altered environment and also to infer regulators that trigger the response.
Current time—series analysis methods, however, are not powerful enough to identify perturbed
pathways and regulators simultaneously. Widely used methods include methods to determine
gene sets such as differentially expressed genes or gene clusters and these genes sets need to be
further interpreted in terms of biological pathways using other tools. Most pathway analysis meth—
ods are not designed for time series data and they do not consider gene—gene influence on the time
dimension.

Results: In this article, we propose a novel time—series analysis method TimeTP for determining
transcription factors (TFs) regulating pathway perturbation, which narrows the focus to perturbed
sub—pathways and utilizes the gene regulatory network and protein—protein interaction network to
locate TFs triggering the perturbation. TimeTP first identifies perturbed sub—pathways that propa—
gate the expression changes along the time. Starting points of the perturbed sub—pathways are
mapped into the network and the most influential TFs are determined by influence maximization
technique. The analysis result is visually summarized in TF-Pathway map in time clock. TimeTP
was applied to P|K3CA knock—in dataset and found significant sub—pathways and their regulators
relevant to the PIP3 signaling pathway.

Availability and Implementation: TimeTP is implemented in Python and available at http://bio
health.snu.ac.kr/software/TimeTP/.

1 Introduction

Our goal in this article is to develop a computational method to per—
form analysis of time series transcriptome data in terms of biological
pathways and also to determine regulators for differentially ex—
pressed gene (DEG) sets or perturbed pathways. Analyzing tran—
scriptome data can be done in many different ways for different
purposes. Thus there are numerous computational methods and we
begin by surveying the literature in the categories such as (i) methods
for determining perturbed pathways, (ii) methods for analyzing time
series transcriptome data, (iii) methods for the pathway based ana—
lysis of time series data and (iv) methods for identifying regulators
while analyzing time series data.

1.1 Methods for determining perturbed pathways

Pathway perturbation has been one of the primary research subjects
in systems biology because the identification of perturbed pathways
can reveal the dysregulated biological mechanism that originates
from stimuli or in disease conditions (Khatri et (11., 2012; Kristensen
et (11., 2014; Ramanan et (11., 2012). The early methods of pathway
analysis include the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) by
Subramanian et al. (2005) and improved versions of GSEA (Medina
et (11., 2009; Nam et (11., 2010) that use gene—level statistics calcu—
lated from the test of differential expression. Later, graph—based al—
gorithms for pathway analysis were developed to utilize interaction
information between genes or proteins in terms of curated pathway

databases such as KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000). The graph—
based pathway analysis has been developing with a seminal work
called the signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) by Tarca et al.
(2009) and the current trend is to focus on locating perturbed sub—
pathways, rather than entire pathways. Tools to determine per—
turbed pathways include DEGraph (Jacob et (11., 2010), DEAP
(Haynes et (11., 2013) and Clipper (Martini et (11., 2013).

1.2 Methods for analyzing time series transcriptome
data

Considering the time dimension, identifying perturbed (sub—)path—
ways in the time—series transcriptome data is much more challeng—
ing. Due to the computational challenges, many computational
methods for the time series analysis do not utilize pathway informa—
tion directly. The widely used time—series analysis methods employ a
strategy of finding DEGs by fitting the gene expression data to a
model with distributional assumption such as Gaussian or negative
binomial distribution. By utilizing statistical methods such as
ANOVA (Park et (11., 2003), several tools and algorithms (Bar—
Joseph et (11., 2003; Conesa et (11., 2006; Storey et (11., 2005) have
been developed for detecting DEG from time—series microarray data.
With the emergence of next—generation sequencing data, DEG detec—
tion algorithms utilized Gaussian process (Aijo et (11., 2014) or hid—
den Markov models (Leng et (11., 2015) to identify DEGs from time
series RNA—seq data. Instead of identifying DEGs, clustering
approaches have been developed to determine a set of genes with a
similar pattern of gene expression profile. Clustering expression
data in the gene—time dimension is performed by considering correl—
ation (Wen et (11., 1998) or by model—based clustering methods
(Ramoni et (11., 2002; Schliep et (11., 2003). Recent methods such as
(Zhao and Zaki, 2005) are further developed to handle data with
higher dimensions such as gene—sample—time. The main limitation of
DEG or clustering approaches is that a list of DEGs or genes in clus—
ters requires further analysis in terms of curated knowledge such as
KEGG pathways and the selection of significant pathways is usually
determined by simple statistical methods such as Fisher’s exact test.
In this way, analysis process does not consider curated knowledge
such as relationships among genes, e.g. those in KEGG pathways, to
determine how genes interact over time. More advanced methods
consider relationship between genes or between time points (e.g. dy—
namic Bayesian network) to infer the gene regulatory network
(GRN) (Honkela et (11., 2010) or protein—protein interaction net—
work (PIN) (Kim et (11., 2014b). These methods, although powerful,
are limited to the analysis of small size gene sets (Kim et (11., 2014a).

1.3 Methods forthe pathway based analysis of time
series data

To incorporate pathway information for the time series data ana—
lysis, pathways are modeled as graphs. Two recent graph—based
pathway analysis algorithms for time—series data are TRAP (Jo et (11.,
2014) and TimeClip (Martini et (11., 2014). TRAP (J0 et (11., 2014)
leverages the technique similar to SPIA (Tarca et (11., 2009) to detect
pathways with a significant expression propagation along the path—
way graph in the time order. TimeClip (Martini et (11., 2014) em—
ploys a junction tree algorithm to form sub—pathways using the
same method used in Clipper (Martini et (11., 2013) to determine sig—
nificant sub—pathways in terms of the first principal component
from the gene expression data. Although these algorithms produce a
list of biological processes with significant changes over time, few
attempts have been made to locate the regulator that initiates the
pathway perturbation.

1.4 Methods for identifying regulators while analyzing
time series data

DREM (Ernst et (11., 2007) is an example of incorporating regulators
in clustering analysis. It estimates transcription factors (TFs) regulat—
ing a cluster by Input—Output Hidden Markov Model, but it is hard
to discover biological implication from the result due to the clusters
with multiple or overlapping biological functions. Master regulator
analysis (MRA) (Carro et (11., 2010) introduces a method to rank
TFs in the GRN, but not considering dynamic expression profiles of
genes.

1.5 Motivation

Analysis of time—series omics data is very difficult and there are only
a few tools available (Spies and Ciaudo, 2015). In addition, it is de—
sirable to identify regulators such as TF that are likely to induce
changes in transcriptome over time. However, on top of the com—
plexity of analyzing time series data, considering regulators such as
TF makes the complexity of the time series data analysis task dra—
matically high. In this study, we propose a novel bioinformatics
method for analyzing time series omics data to identify both per—
turbed pathways and regulating TFs. Two main ideas are:

i. We start the analysis by identifying perturbed pathways in com—
parison of control vs. treatment group and then focusing on TFs
that are relevant to the perturbed pathways. In this way, much
smaller number of TFs and pathways are considered, thus the
complexity of the analysis task is signiﬁcantly reduced.

ii. To systematically analyze the effect of TFs over time, we adopt
and further develop the inﬂuence maximization technique in the
bounded time.

With these two main ideas, we designed and implemented a
time—series analysis method of finding TFs regulating perturbed sub—
pathways (TimeTP). The key properties of TimeTP are as follows.
(i) TimeTP identifies perturbed sub—pathways that propagate their
expression levels along time and also identifies TFs triggering that
pathway perturbation by our four—step approach. (ii) TimeTP
adopts two well—established computational methods, cross—
correlation (Ianniello, 1982) and inﬂuence maximization (Kempe
et (11., 2003), from the fields of signal processing and social network.
(iii) The novel framework of TimeTP produces the ~[VF-Pathway map
in time clock to trace the pathway perturbation triggered from TF to
pathway. As well as the effective visualization of TF—Pathway map,
TimeTP provides user—friendly interface by handling a diverse range
of input data in terms of type of dataset (RNA—seq or microarray)
and type of condition (single time—series or control—treatment).

The rest of the article is organized as follows. The process of per—
turbed sub—pathway mining in TimeTP will be described in Sections
2.1—2.3. Sections 2.4 and 2.5 explain the time bounded network
construction and the inﬂuence maximization algorithm for finding
TFs. TimeTP is tested by using the biological dataset and the result
is compared with other pathway/sub—pathway mining tools and
regulator analysis algorithms in Section 3.

2 Methods

The overview of the proposed method is depicted in Figure 1. To
model pathways over time, we created an augmented pathway graph
where a node is a gene augmented with a differential expression vec—
tor as an attribute of a node. By measuring cross—correlation, we de—
termine a set of perturbed sub—pathways containing only genes that
are connected to propagate expression changes over time. The next

Fig. 1. Overview of TimeTP analysis workflow. TimeTP uses an integrated network of GRN and PIN. Each biological pathway is analyzed by TimeTP and the per-
turbed sub-pathways are identified with the time-delay-bounded propagation of gene expression. The starting point or a gene of each perturbed sub-pathway is
mapped to the integrated network and then regulators of the perturbed sub-pathways are identified by the labeled influence maximization algorithm

major task is to determine TFs regulating the perturbed pathways.
In general, TFs are not included in pathways, thus we used GRN to
establish orthogonal relationship between regulators and pathways.
Identification of regulating TFs requires to estimate the system—wide
effect of a TF. To estimate the system—wide inﬂuence of a TF, we
first augment GRN with PIN. As a result, we have a network of
GRN and PIN combined and the network is big enough to have con—
nections from TF to genes in the pathways. To evaluate of the inﬂu—
ence of TF on the perturbed pathways, we used a labeled inﬂuence
maximization algorithm.

2.1 Differential expression vector

Each pathway in the curated pathway database such as KEGG can
be represented as a directed graph G : (N,E). Genes and their
interactions correspond to nodes and edges in the pathway graph,
respectively. TimeTP assigns a time vector 17 for each node, repre—
senting the differentially expressed time points as 1(overexpressed)
or —1(underexpressed) and otherwise as 0. For example, if data has
T number of measured time points and has control and treatment
conditions to compare, either —1, 1 or 0, will be assigned for each
time point in a differential expression vector 17 of length T. If the
data are generated in a single condition, the differential expression
can be tested between two time points (e.g. relative to the first time
point or adjacent) resulting in a vector of length T — 1. Whether
two groups of samples are differentially expressed is determined by
Limma (Smyth, 2005) for microarray or by DESeq2 (Love et 41].,
2014) for RNA—seq data.

2.2 Perturbed sub—pathway with delay—bounded
expression propagation

For each pathway, TimeTP searches for the perturbed sub—pathway
by choosing valid edges from the edges in the original pathway in—
formation. The validity of edges is determined by looking at the rela—
tionship between differential expression vectors of two nodes. We
propose two criteria for edges in the perturbed sub—pathway. First,
every edge of the perturbed sub—pathway is required to propagate
the differential expression pattern along the given direction. Assume

that an edge N1 —> N2 from a node N1 to a node N2 has differential
expression vectors 171 and 172 , respectively. The direction of propaga—
tion and the number of delayed time points for a pair of expression
vectors can be approximated by cross—correlation, which is a meas—
ure of similarity of two time—series in signal processing. Cross—
correlation of two vectors 171 and 172 is defined as

maxmzz‘” 3(t)va(t+n) (1)

t:—oc

where 17 (t) : 0 for t S 0 or t > T (This happens at the preceding or
trailing entries of two vectors). When the two vectors overlap most
with n delay, cross—correlation is maximized with a parameter 7;.
Therefore, TimeTP finds the shortest possible delay between two
differential expression vectors d(171 ,172) where cross—correlation be—
tween two vectors is maximized.

d(171 ,172) : arg max(171 M72)(n) (2)

When d(171 ,172) of a directed edge (N1, N2) is negative, it implies
that the direction of the expression propagation is opposite to the
given direction. In this case, the edge is considered as invalid and
excluded from the perturbed sub—pathway. Next, a threshold for
delay is used to filter out edges with a long positive delay, i.e. bigger
than a user defined threshold value, so that the expression propaga—
tion in the sub—pathway is bounded within a time period that the
user allows. Figure 2 shows the examples of delay analysis, where
the edge in Figure 2a has a one time point of delay with maximum
cross—correlation 2. Figure 2b is an example of an invalid edge
due to the negative delay. Perturbed sub—pathway with one edge is
disregarded. Since TimeTP determines the best delay between two
genes, different delays can be assigned to different gene pairs, which
can reﬂect the different speed of signaling steps in the biological
pathways.

Once perturbed sub—pathways with bounded propagation is
determined from each pathway, source nodes with no incoming
edge in the sub—pathways are labeled as targets in the time bounded
network. Node weights of labeled source nodes are set as the num—
ber of nodes in the sub—pathway and for the other nodes not labeled,
zero or negative numbers are assigned so that no profit can be

earned from non—labeled nodes. This profit assignment scheme is
used to define and rank regulators.

2.3 P—value for perturbed sub—pathway

P—value of the perturbed sub—pathway is estimated by the permuta—
tion test. The null hypothesis is that perturbed sub—pathways deter—
mined by TimeTP are randomly generated, without considering the
order of genes and their expression patterns in the pathway. To test
the hypothesis, differential expression vector for each gene is ran—
domly re—assigned from the vector set of the whole genes and sub—
pathways are sampled according to the same procedure described in
Section 2.2. Given that the ratio of DEGs is not aberrantly high,
sampled sub—pathways determined from the randomly assigned

expression vectors are most likely to have a short path length.
Cross—correlation of each edge is likely to be small as well due to the
short overlap of two expression vectors. Therefore, a sum of the
cross—correlation of every node pair in the sampled sub—pathway is
chosen to be a pathway—level statistic and the p—value for a per—
turbed sub—pathway is derived as the probability of having higher
statistics in the sample distribution.

2.4 Time bounded network construction

To search for upstream regulators of perturbed sub—pathways, an
integrated network of GRN and PIN is constructed. Interaction in—
formation between TF and target genes (TGs) in GRN is derived
from HTRIdb (Bovolenta et (11., 2012) that provides experimentally
verified or computationally predicted TF—DNA—binding sites from
six public databases and literature (Ernst et (11., 2010). Protein—pro—
tein interaction for PIN is from STRING (Szklarczyk et (11., 2014)
database. Integrated network of GRN and PIN is used to determine
TFs that have the most overall effect on perturbed sub—pathways
and to connect the TFs and perturbed sub—pathways. Two expres—
sion vectors that do not preserve the time order are filtered out so
that expression propagation along the connecting path is always
valid in terms of time clock, as described in Section 2.2. This process
produces a time bounded network. As for undirected edges of PIN,
delay of Equation 2 is calculated for both directions and directed
edge with nonnegative delay remains.

2.5 Labeled influence maximization for TF detection
The main goal of inﬂuence maximization is to locate a set of seed
nodes in the network that could maximize the spread of inﬂuence
(Kempe et (11., 2003) and the technique has been successfully used to
select marketing targets in the social network. A modified version
called the labeled inﬂuence maximization developed by Li et al.
(2011) exploits profit values of nodes to prefer seed nodes that have
an inﬂuence on a specific node set. TimeTP utilizes a greedy version
of the labeled inﬂuence maximization algorithm to the time
bounded network with a few modifications (see below) so that inﬂu—
ence of a gene on the perturbed sub—pathways are properly modeled.
Labeled inﬂuence maximization algorithm (Algorithm 1) used in
TimeTP is intended to determine the most inﬂuential k regulators in
the time bounded network G, especially TFs targeting the starting
nodes of the perturbed sub—pathways. It first initializes a set of seed
nodes S and a set of nodes that can be inﬂuenced by seed nodes
SeedInfSet as an empty set. For every TF t not selected as a seed node
and not inﬂuenced by the current seed nodes, its inﬂuence Inf [t] is
quantified by the average profit values of nodes that the TF can
reach. The same procedure is repeated for Round times creating a
subgraph G’ from G according to the edge weight between 0 and 1
regarded as a probability of an edge (line 4—9). Probability of edges
is derived from the confidence score of STRING and 1 for GRN
edges. After the iteration, a TF with the maximum inﬂuence is
included in the seed set and SeedInfSet is updated as well.

3 Results

TimeTP is tested with a genome—wide RNA—seq dataset of non—
transformed human breast epithelial cells MCF10a starved over—
night and stimulated with 10 ng/ml EGF for 15, 40, 90, 180 and 300
min (Kiselev et (11., 2015 ), in WT and PIK3CA knock—in samples. To
test the power of influence maximization, we need to choose data—
sets with many time points and also with sequencing data to accur—
ately model inﬂuence of TFs. Note that many datasets with only

two time points are not meaningful for this analysis. In addition, to
test the performance of the proposed approach, data should have
replicates to determine differential expression accurately and the
interval between time points should be short to model signaling ef—
fects. The MCF10a data were the only one to meet the criteria.

PIK3CA knock—in samples (referred to as ‘PIK3CA H1047R’)
contains a mutated gene that encodes the p1100r catalytic
subunit (PIK3CA). PIK3CA is a component gene of Class IA
phosphoinositide—3—kinases (PI3Ks) and the mutated form of PIK3CA
is expected to exhibit chronic activation of phosphatidylinositol
(3,4,5)—trisphosphate (PIP3) signaling. PI3K/PIP3 signaling pathway
plays a key role in cell growth and migration. In addition, several
driver mutations in PI3K/PIP3 pathway have been found in multiple
types of cancer. Especially, oncogenic mutations of PIK3CA gene are
discovered in up to 45% of human breast cancer samples (Network
et (11., 2012). Thus, this experiment is designed to trigger long—term
activation of PIP3 signaling by the modification of PIK3CA and track
its downstream effect. Analysis result of TimeTP is composed of the
TF—Pathway map in time clock and the whole list of perturbed path—
ways as shown in Figure 3 and Table 1. Javascript library of
Cytoscape is used for TF—Pathway map visualization (Shannon et (11.,
2003).

3.1 TF—Pathway map in time clock

Figure 3 is the map of inﬂuence path from the TFs selected by the in—
ﬂuence maximization algorithm to perturbed sub—pathways.
Pathways perturbed but not affected by TFs are excluded in the TF—
Pathway map. For example, TimeTP detected perturbation of the
PI3K—Akt signaling pathway (Table 1) but it was not included the
TF—Pathway map in time clock (Fig. 3) because PI3K—Akt signaling
pathway is directly activated by the modification of PIK3CA in the
experiment.

As in Figure 3, FOXO4 is on the top of the TF—Pathway map and
propagates its effect to all of the downstream pathways and FoxO
signaling pathway itself. The forkhead box 0 (FoxO) TFs are
known as targets of the serine/threonine protein kinases (PKB)/Akt
(Zhang et (11., 2011) that is directly affected by PIP3 generation
(Kiselev et (11., 2015). Specifically, Akt inhibits FoxOs and causes
consequent inactivation of FoxO signaling pathway, which can be
clearly shown in the TF—Pathway map of PIK3CA H1047R samples.
Wnt signaling pathway is one of the activated pathways in PIK3CA
H1047R samples. TimeTP estimated that differential expression of
the TF FOXO4 and SREBF1 in the early time points (1—3) is propa—
gated through the path and activated Wnt signaling. Although the
first gene GSK3B of the perturbed sub—pathway is down—regulated,
consequently it made CTNNB1 that encodes [f—catenin activated to
further transduce the signal to other cytoplasmic regions or into the
nucleus. Interaction of FoxOs with [f—catenin has an inhibitory effect
on [f—catenin activity (Essers et (11., 2005), while TimeTP inferred a
devious route that has the same consequence. As for the cooperation
between PI3K—Akt signaling and Wnt signaling, several studies pro—
vide the logical underpinnings (Perry et (11., 2011; Vadlakonda et (11.,
2013).

The activation process of ErbB signaling pathway and Regulation
of actin cytoskeleton is more complicated. Albeit both perturbed sub—
pathways themselves are seemingly down—regulated first, the path
from TF to the first genes of the sub—pathway (ACTB, ACT G1,
HBEGF) is activated and finally three genes are activated in the last
time point, forecasting the late activation of two pathways beyond the
observed time points. As in the previous studies (Hynes and Lane,
2005 ), ErbB signaling pathway encompasses the PI3K—Akt signaling

pathway. The perturbed sub—pathway that TimeTP detected in the
ErbB signaling pathway includes the cell surface receptor EGFR,
which is the upstream part of PI3K—Akt pathway. Taken together, the
effect of Akt signaling activation attributes the delayed activation of
the ErbB signaling, which can be the positive feedback loop of the
Akt signaling pathway. Detection of a transcriptional feedback loop
of PIP3 signaling is the major contribution of the original article of
the dataset (Kiselev et (11., 2015) and the analysis result of TimeTP can
be a parallel contribution of the study. Moreover, TF—Pathway path
to the Regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathway found in TimeTP re—
sult suggests for further research in addition to the previously sug—
gested path (Jimenez et (11., 2000).

EC gamma-R mediated phagocytosis is one of the activated path—
ways in PIK3CA knock—in samples. Mammary epithelial cells can
act as phagocytes (Monks et (11., 2005). During phagocytosis, ligated
Fc gamma—R on plasma membranes induces recruitment of PI3K
and increased synthesis of PIP3 (Zhang et (11., 2010). TimeTP found
the perturbation of phagocytosis pathway starting from PI3K recep—
tor and its downstream genes. One of the TFs expected to trigger the
perturbation is ATF3 (Fig. 3) down—regulated in the early time
points, which is a key regulator that inhibits the immune response of
macrophage (Gilchrist et (11., 2006). Our analysis correctly suggested
that ATF3 would function similarly in MCF10a cells. TimeTP de—
tected the same sub—pathway in Oocyte meiosis and Oxytoxin sig-
naling. In both pathways, Calcium/calmodulin (CALM) signaling
pathway is included and its sub—pathway was found as perturbed.
Previous studies of mammary carcinoma cells report that calmodu—
lin mediates Akt activity (Coticchia et (11., 2009; Deb et (11., 2004),
suggesting that the increased PIP3 not only recruited Akt by itself
but also induced calmodulin—dependent activation of Akt signaling
pathway.

3.2 Comparison with existing pathway/regulator
analysis tools

Most of the pathway analysis tools assume that the expression value
for each gene follows the Gaussian distribution, which is not appro—
priate next generation sequencing data. Therefore, we selected four
representative tools without the Gaussian assumption in each class
of pathway analysis tools: DEAP(sub—pathway analysis),
timeClip(sub—pathway analysis, time—series), SPIA(pathway ana—
lysis), TRAP(pathway analysis, time—series). Samples of different
time points are treated as replicates in DEAP and SPIA that do not
perform time—series analysis, and WT samples are not used for

Table 1 shows a list of sub—pathways with significant expression
propagation from TimeTP analysis. DEAP and SPIA failed to choose
most of the pathways including PI3K—Akt signaling pathway that is
expected to be activated in PIK3CA H1047R samples, presumably
due to the disregard of time factor. timeClip and TRAP selected out
more significant (sub—)pathways, yet disregarded FoxO signaling
pathway and ErbB signaling pathway presumably pertaining to PIP3
signaling as described in Section 3.1. Pathways that were not de—
tected by TimeTP but by other (sub—)pathway analysis tools are
summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Relevance to PI3K was eval—
uated using a state of the art context—aware literature search tool,
BEST (http://best.korea.ac.kr/). Running times of the methods are
compared in Supplementary Table 3. Even though TimeTP performs
an additional step, that is, inﬂuence maximization, compared with
competing pathway analysis tools, overall running time of TimeTP
is similar to those of other pathway analysis tools. As for the sub—
pathway detection process of TimeTP, running time of TimeTP

TFs from DREM do not have ranks.

(408.862 5) is smaller than the average running time of other four
tools (849.077 5) and the overall process including the regulator
search by inﬂuence maximization takes similar time (906.767 s) in
average.

Two regulator analysis methods are compared with TimeTP.
MRA is a method for selecting and ranking TFs in GRN and DREM
is a tool for time—series clustering. WT samples are not used for
DREM that does not support control versus treatment analysis.
Table 2 is the list of master TFs selected from TimeTP, MRA and
DREM. TFs from TimeTP are regulators of the perturbed sub—
pathways chosen and ranked by the labeled inﬂuence maximization

algorithm. Among 16 TFs from the TimeTP result, USF1, TGIF1
and RREB1 are TFs expected to bind to strongly genes regulated in
the PI3K signaling—activated samples based on the motif activity
analysis in the original paper of the dataset, corroborating the cred—
ibility of TimeTP. MRA performs Fisher’s exact test to first confirm
the ratio of signature genes among its TGs and ranks TFs that passed
the test by the number of signature genes. To apply the same stand—
ard with TimeTP, TF—gene interaction information is extracted from
the same GRN and 18 genes that start the perturbation in each sub—
pathway are used as signature genes for MRA. However, only one
TF, SREBF1 that directly targets Wnt signaling pathway satisfied
the criteria of MRA. Distinct from the one—to—one mapping of a
MRA, the inﬂuence maximization algorithm rescued 15 TFs with in—
direct inﬂuence on targeted pathways in the network structure in
addition to SREBF1. Furthermore, TFs that target multiple path—
ways are prioritized higher than TFs with a single target. LMO2,
ATF3, FOXO4 and RFX1 in the Figure 3 are such examples. TFs
that do not target multiple pathways but are highly ranked have the
small number of downstream genes, thus the ratio of genes in the
perturbed pathway is relatively high among its downstream genes.
DREM performed time—series clustering and found three TFs differ—
ent from TimeTP or MRA, regulating one of the clusters
(Supplementary Figure S1). The three TFs target the same cluster
with 71 genes, but the cluster is not enriched with any KEGG path—
way by Fisher’s exact test (Supplementary Table S2).

4 Conclusion

We presented TimeTP, a four—step approach to locate perturbed
sub—pathways and their regulators from time—series transcriptome
data. TimeTP has two novel contributions: estimation of delay be—
tween two expression vectors that leads to the construction of a time
bounded sub—graph, and introduction of the inﬂuence maximization
technique into the analysis of times series data in search of TFs
that are involved in perturbed pathways. TimeTP is the first

sub—pathway mining tool for time—series data that analyzes and visu—
alizes the explicit expression pattern, providing a holistic picture of
the pathway perturbation dynamics. In particular, TF—Pathway map
in time clock enables user to navigate the perturbation propagation
route along time.

Analysis of the PIK3CA knock—in dataset shows that TimeTP
can capture the perturbation in PI3K—Akt signaling, confirming the
main objective of the biological experiment and re—producing conse—
quent changes in the downstream pathways. Especially, FOXO4 is
expected to be the master regulator of the perturbation of five path—
ways in TF—Pathway map, which is in an agreement with the fact
that FoxO TFs are the known targets of Akt. As well as the perturb—
ation in FoxO and Wnt signaling pathway directly affected by
FoxOs, TimeTP suggests the late activation of ErbB pathway that
highlights the same assumption of previous study, a positive feed—
back loop of the Akt signaling. In addition, TFs predicted and
ranked by TimeTP include three important TFs from the original
article of the dataset while MRA or DREM failed to discover any
TF in the list.

TimeTP supports various types of dataset with ﬂexible param—
eters that can be adjusted for the search of regulators. We believe
that TimeTP will be a very valuable tool to identify both perturbed
pathways and their regulators, especially in analysis of time series
sequencing data.

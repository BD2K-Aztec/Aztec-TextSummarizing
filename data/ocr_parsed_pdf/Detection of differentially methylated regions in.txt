Abstract

Motivation: DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that has essential role in
gene regulation, cell differentiation and cancer development. Bisulfite sequencing is a widely used
technique to obtain genome—wide DNA methylation profiles, and one of the key tasks of analyzing
bisulfite sequencing data is to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs) among samples
under different treatment conditions. Although numerous tools have been proposed to detect dif—
ferentially methylated single CpG site (DMC) between samples, methods for direct DMR detection,
especially for complex study designs, are largely limited.

Results: We present a new software, GetisDMR, for direct DMR detection. We use beta—binomial regres—
sion to model the whole—genome bisulfite sequencing data, where variations in methylation levels and
confounding effects have been accounted for. We employ a region—wise test statistic, which is derived
from local Getis—Ord statistics and considers the spatial correlation between nearby CpG sites, to detect
DMRs. Unlike existing methods, that attempt to infer DMRs from DMCs based on empirical criteria, we
provide statistical inference for direct DMR detection. Through extensive simulations and an application
to two mouse datasets, we demonstrate that GetisDMR achieves better sensitivities, positive predictive
values, more exact locations and better agreement of DMRs with current biological knowledge.

1 Introduction

DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic modification that plays a key
role in numerous biological processes, such as genomic imprinting,
regulation of gene expression, cell differentiation, development and
carcinogenesis (Deaton and Bird, 2011; Ehrlich, 2002; Li et (11., 1993;
Santos et (11., 2002; Suzuki and Bird, 2008). The presence oflarge scale
aberrant DNA methylation pattern, typically with site-specific hyper-
methylation in tumor suppressor genes and global hypo-methylation
in oncogenes compared to normal tissue, is a hallmark feature of vari-
ous types of cancers (Ehrlich, 2002; Sharma et (11., 2010).

The whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), which com-
bines the bisulfite treatment with next generation sequencing, be-
comes the state-of-the-art technology in investigating DNA
methylation pattern at single base resolution with relatively high
coverage across multiple samples. The bisulfite treatment converts
un-methylated cytosines to uracils, while leaving the methylated
cytosines unchanged. Thus, it allows for the discrimination between
methylated and unmethylated CpG sites (Clark et (11., 2006).
Methylation proportion at each CpG site is usually defined as the

proportion of molecules with cytosine methylated (WCT) and is used

to summarize the pattern of DNA methylation (Akalin et al., 2012;
Dolzhenko and Smith, 2014; Schultz et al., 2012).

Over the past few years, a number of approaches have been pro—
posed for assessing differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from
WGBS data. One of the most straightforward method is to use the
Fisher’s Exact Test to compare the methylation proportions among
different treatment groups at each CpG site (Lister et al., 2009).
Recently, Saito et al. developed the ComMet, which is built based
on hidden Markov models and designed to detect DMRs between a
pair of samples (Saito et al., 2014). Though these methods are easy
to implement and can compare a pair of samples obtained either dir—
ectly from the experiment or by pooling together samples under the
same experimental condition, these methods do not take the be—
tween sample variations into account and cannot adjust for con—
founding effects when replicates are available (Hansen et al., 2012;
Jaffe et al., 2012).

Converging evidences suggest that close—by CpG sites tend to
have similar methylation proportions (Hansen et al., 2012;
Hebestreit et al., 2013). With the assumption that methylation pro—
portions change smoothly along the genome and the adjacent CpG
sites have similar methylation proportions, various smoothing based
methods have been proposed to detect DMRs (Hansen et al., 2012).
Although the smoothing procedures adopted by these methods may
differ in details, all of them employ local averaging to improve the
precision of the methylation proportion estimates, especially for
CpG sites with low coverage. For example, the BSmooth method
first estimates the methylation proportions with a local—likelihood
smoother, and then performs the statistical test using a signal—to—
noise statistic (Hansen et al., 2012). A DMR is claimed when groups
of consecutive Cst with the signal—to—noise statistics larger than a
cutoff selected based on its marginal distribution. BiSeq first em—
ploys a local smoothing technique and then detects DMRs based on
the smoothed methylation proportion estimates (Hebestreit et al.,
2013). The key difference between BiSeq and BSmooth is that BiSeq
adopts a hierarchical testing procedure to detect DMRs and takes
the spatial correlations among P—values of adjacent CpG sites into
account. The BiSeq requires the specification of a set of candidate re—
gions that may be differentially methylated, and thus it is only suit—
able for detecting DMRs in targeted bisulfite sequencing data.
Though smoothing based methods make use of information from
adjacent CpG sites, in most cases they require biological replicates
and thus cannot be applied to the datasets without replicates.
Currently, the WGBS is quite costly, which prohibits the obtainment
of multiple replicates for different experimental conditions given
limited budget (Hirst and Marra, 2010; Stevens et al., 2013). It is
quite common that some of the biological replicates are combined
into one sample before library generation for sequencing experi—
ments (Laurent et al., 2010; Saito et al., 2014). Moreover, there are
situations where biological replicates are hard to obtain, especially
in retrospective studies (Beyan et al., 2012).

Regression based methods have also been proposed to detect
DMRs. For example, Methleit assumes that the number of methy—
lated reads follows a binomial distribution, and models the methy—
lated reads within the logistic regression framework (Akalin et al.,
2012). The P—values are calculated and multiple comparisons are ad—
justed using a sliding linear model method. As methylation propor—
tions vary significantly across individuals, failure to consider the
variability across individuals may result in inflated type—I error
(Hansen et al., 2012; Jaffe et al., 2012). Beta—binomial regression
has been recently introduced to model methylation proportions in
WGBS data, as it can take both the sampling and epigenetic

variations into account (Dolzhenko and Smith, 2014; Feng et al.,
2014; Park et al., 2014). For example, DSS method uses a
lognormal—beta—binomial Bayesian hierarchical model to describe
the methylated reads, and the DMR is defined as the CpG site with
P—value less than a pre—specified threshold (Feng et al., 2014). The
DSS method allows information sharing across different CpG sites
to improve precision of the test, but the correlation of P—values for
proximal sites is not explicitly modeled in the DMR detection. This
may reduce both the sensitivity and specificity of the test. The
methylSig method also models the methylated reads using a beta—
binomial distribution and the likelihood ratio test is used to detect
differentially methylated single CpG (DMC) site (Park et al., 2014).
Although the methylSig can be used to identify DMCs, it does not
have the mechanism to detect DMRs which is of more biological
relevance. RADMeth adopts a beta—binomial regression to calculate
the P—values of each CpG site and then combines the information
from P—values within 200 base pairs(bp) (Dolzhenko and Smith,
2014). Beta—binomial regression based methods can explicitly take
both the epigenetic and sampling variations into account, but they
mainly focus on detecting DMCs and have limited power of identify—
ing DMRs. They usually pre—specify a certain length for the DMR
and then combines the information within the window to infer the
significance of the detected DMRs (Akalin et al., 2012; Dolzhenko
and Smith, 2014). However, compelling evidences suggest that the
length of DMRs can range from a few base pairs to thousands of
base pairs, and a fixed length of DMR certainly contradicts with the
existing biological knowledge (Sun et al., 2014). Compared with de—
tecting DMCs, DMR detection has several advantages. First, locat—
ing the regions with multiple DMCs are one of the most basic goals
for methylation studies. Second, as pointed out by Bock, after ad—
justing for multiple comparisons for DMC detection, only the stron—
gest differences tend to remain significant (Bock, 2012). Targeting
at detecting DMR rather than single DMC can substantially reduce
the number of hypothesis being tested and thus increases the statis—
tical power (Bock, 2012; Hebestreit et al., 2013).

To overcome the current limitations, we develop GetisDMR, a
genome—wide methylation analysis tool for direct DMR detection.
GetisDMR utilizes a beta—binomial distribution (with biological repli—
cates) or binomial distribution (without biological replicates) to
model the methylated reads. When bioloigcal replicates are available,
it also adopts a regression framework to account for the potential
confounding effects. It further uses a local Getis—0rd statistic, which
is widely used in identifying statistically significant spatial clusters of
high/low values (hot spots) (Bhunia et al., 2013; Getis and 0rd, 1992;
0rd and Getis, 1995, 2001), to detect DMRs. The length of detected
DMRs is determined by the data, and the statistical inference of the
detected DMRs is also provided. In the following sections, we first lay
out the details of the method, and then we compare our method with
ComMet, BSmooth and DSS through simulation studies (Feng et al.,
2014; Hansen et al., 2012; Saito et al., 2014). We further apply our
method to two public available mouse datasets (Hon et al., 2013;
Lister et al., 2013), and finally we briefly discuss our results.

2 Methods

2.1 Beta—binomial regression

We use a beta—binomial distribution to characterize the methylation
data. We assume at each CpG site, the number of methylated reads
follows a binomial distribution, Xiyk ~ Binomial(N,~,~k,p,~/k), where
17%, XW and NW represent the methylation proportion, the number
of methylated reads, and the total number of reads at the kth CpG
site of jth sample in the ith treatment group.

DMR detection with local Getis—0rd statistics

 

To consider the biological variability between different samples
under the same treatment condition (i.e. there are biological repli—
cates), we assume the methylation proportion follows a beta distri—
bution (i.e. piyk ~ Beta(oc,~k.ﬁik)). Therefore, the number of
methylated reads (Xijk) at each CpG site has a beta—binomial distri—
bution with probability mass function:

 

(1)

P(Xijk : x) : (9:112) name + x>r<ﬁik + Nil'k _ x)r(“ik ‘l' ﬁik)

r(Ni/'lz ‘1' Mile ‘1' ﬁik)r(“ik)r(ﬁik)

where F(x) : ISO t"_1e_’dt.

The mean and variance of X,,k are Niykyik and Nil-kyikﬂ — yik)(1+
(Nil-jz — 1)¢>,~k) respectively, Where We : ﬂ and (1),-k : 

We use beta—binomial regression to model the methylation pro—
portions at each CpG site given different treatment conditions and
covariates. Specifically, given the number of methylated reads at each
CpG site follows a beta—binomial distribution specified in Equation
(1), we assume Hi), : g(Z11), where g is a logistic link function, Z is a
design matrix and 11 is a vector of regression parameters. The regres—
sion parameters (11) can be interpreted as the log odds ratio for each
additional unit increase in the explanatory variable (i.e. Z).

The beta—binomial regression model is fit for each CpG site, and
the parameters (i.e. (1),-k, wk and 11) are estimated through maximizing
the likelihood function. The significance of the treatment effect is
tested using the likelihood ratio test.

It is noteworthy that in the case where biological replicates are
not available, we assume the number of methylated reads follows a
binomial distribution, which is a special case of beta—binomial distri—
bution(i.e (1),-k : 0). Under this situation, a x2 test of independence
or a Fisher’s Exact Test will be conducted to test the significance of
the treatment effect at each CpG site.

2.2 Detection of differentially methylated regions

It is well known that methylation proportions are strongly spatially
correlated. Hebestreit et al. have shown that local smoothing can re—
duce the variance of methylation proportions, especially for lowly
covered CpG sites (Hebestreit et al., 2013). Although local smooth—
ing has the potential to increase the power, it is not applicable when
biological replicates are not available as the variance of methylation
proportions cannot be estimated based on smoothed methylation
proportions. What we have observed is that the spatial correlations
among near—by CpG sites are also preserved in the test statistics
(Supplementary Fig. 51). To make use of this information, we pro—
pose a local Getis—0rd statistic based method to detect DMRs. The
rationale of using such a statistic is that most of the genetic regions
are not differentially methylated, and identifying DMRs is similar to
hot—spot detection from the perspective of spatial statistics, where
local Getis—0rd statistics have been widely used. In our method, we
first transform the P—values into z—scores (z;z : (ID—1(1 — pk), with
CID—1 being the inverse of a standard normal distribution function),
which should approximately follow a normal distribution as most of
the CpG sites are not differentially methylated. We further use the
local Getis—0rd statistics to detect DMRs based on z—scores.

The local Getis—0rd statistic is defined as

n n
2 wklzl - 5 2 wk!
* [:1 [:1
Gk : —,, n (2)

S [:1 [:1

where n is the total number of CpG sites, 5 : 2k zk/n,
S : j/Zk zi/n — £2, and wk) is the weight parameters between kth

CpG site and the lth CpG site (Getis and 0rd, 1992; 0rd and Getis,
1995).

The correlation of the local Getis—0rd statistics between the kth
CpG site and the mth CpG sites is

11 Z, wklwml — W; W;

corr(G,:. (3;) z?
["3112 - (WE) llnSm -(W:;.) l

(3)

where W; : lekl and S1:z : Elwil.

We further denote G": [G4. G3. G3 . . . . G;]’, and therefore
asymptotically 6*N MVN(0. E) with EM : corr(G,:,  The
Getis—0rd statistics detect those CpG sites with values higher/lower
in magnitude than we would expect on a random basis. A high/low
value indicates that its neighborhood CpG sites also have high/low
values, and vice versa. A value near zero indicates there is no appar—
ent concentration (i.e. the neighborhood CpG sites have a range of
values, and there is no apparent hot—spots and thus no DMRs).

The weight parameters (why) for the local Getis—0rd statistics G:
is determined based on the correlation between z—scores. The correl—
ations between z—scores are estimated using the empirical variogram
(corr(zk.z1) : (var(z) — v(d))/var(z), where zk and z; is d bp apart
and y(d) is the semivariogram). Let 2 represent the estimated vari—
ance covariance matrix, 2% be the covariance vector between kth
CpG site and the rest of the CpG sites, and 242.42 be the variance—
covariance matrix between all CpG sites except the kth CpG site.
The weight parameters (wkl) is determined by 2,221.42.

For the whole genome sequencing data, the estimation of semi—
variogram at every possible distances between two CpG sites and
the inverse of the covariance matrix are computationally demand—
ing. However, as shown in Supplementary Figure 51, the correlation
reduces substantially as physical distance between two CpG sites in—
creases. A set of commonly used models in spatial statistics, such as
exponential model, Spherical variogram and Matern class of mod—
els, can be used to model this relationship. To reduce the computa—
tional burden, we only consider a limited range over which spline
was used to capture the relationship between the physical distance
and correlation. The correlations between CpG sites with distance
larger than a'select are set at zero, which substantially reduces the
computational cost. The correlation between z—scores of two CpG
sites is calculated as below:

x : 0 ifd > dselect

corrz vz :
(k I) {y : ﬂd) ifdédsaect

where d: )pos,z —pos,), posh is the physical location of the kth
CpG site, and f(d) is a spline function which captures the relation—
ship between correlation and physical distance.

To dete DMRs, we define a region—based spatial statistics,
GPOSBPOS/ : (+5’, where S is the set of CpG sites with physical loca—
tion within (pos,, posj), and )S) is the total number of CpG sites in S.
To determine the boundary of methylated region to be evaluated,
we adopt a data—adaptive method. Instead of evaluating every region
with a fixed length, we only evaluate the significance of the region
given a pre—determined number of CpG sites with G: larger than a
cut—off value. Asymptotically, GPOSBPOS/ N N (0, $2), where
(p2 : ZMJES cov(G,:.  The significance of the test statistics
(GPOSDPOS) can also be evaluated through permutation test.

Our test statistic explicitly makes use of correlations between
nearby CpG sites, which can improve the power of the test. This is
especially true when some CpG sites have relatively low coverage
and the z—scores are not quite accurate for such sites. Instead of test—
ing the significance of each single CpG site, we focus on detecting

ﬁm'spzumol‘pmyo'sopeuuowtotq/ﬁdnq

DMRs, which can substantially reduce the number of hypothesis
being tested and boost the power of DMR detection. Moreover, as
the spatial correlations between z—scores are used to increase the pre—
cision of the estimates, our method can also be directly applied to
the situation where biological replicates are not available (i.e. 1 case
versus 1 control).

3 Simulation

We evaluated the performance of the proposed GetisDMR method
with three commonly adopted methods [i.e ComMet (Saito et al.,
2014), BSmooth (Hansen et al., 2012) and DSS (Feng et al., 2014)]
under various conditions. In simulation one, we compared the per—
formance of GetisDMR with ComMet in the absence of biological
replicates. In simulation two, we compared the performance of
GetisDMR with BSmooth, ComMet and DSS when biological repli—
cates were available. In the third simulation, we compared the
GetisDMR method with the other three methods when confounders/
other covariates that also influenced the methylation proportions
were present. The performance of these methods were evaluated
based on both sensitivity (P(dectected DMthrue DMR)) and posi—
tive predictive value(PPV,P(true DMRldetected DMR)). Similar to
the definition used in ComMet (Saito et al., 2014), a true positive
DMR was defined as a true DMR that overlapped with a detected
DMR in a certain proportion of their lengths. We further defined
sensitivity as the proportion of true DMRs being detected.
Specificity is usually used to evaluate the false positive rate.
However, for the whole genome dataset, a method with a high speci—
ficity may still have a large amount of false positive findings. For ex—
ample, with 99% of specificity, we may still have over thousands of
false positive findings for the WGBS analyses. Therefore, we decided
to report PPV instead of specificity to reflect the false positive rate.
The PPV was defined as the proportion of detected DMRs that over—
lapped with the true DMRs larger than a certain proportion of their
lengths. For all the below simulations, we evaluated the sensitivity
and PPV with 50% overlaps.

3.1 Scenariol

In the first set of simulations, we evaluated the performance of
GetisDMR under a variety of conditions where biological replicates
were not available. Most of the current available methods are de—
signed for the situation where there are biological replicates for each
experimental condition. However, in practice, due to budget and
other issues (Hirst and Marra, 2010; Stevens et al., 2013), biological
replicates are not always available, which makes many smoothing
based methods not applicable. Therefore, in this set of simulations
we compared the sensitivity and PPV of our method with ComMet,
which employs a hidden Markov chain model to detect DMRs. At
the time when the manuscript was written, ComMet is the only
available software that has been claimed to be able to detect DMRs
without biological replicates. To mimic the methylation proportions
and the spatial correlations between adjacent CpG sites, we used a
real dataset from a WGBS experiment (Hon et al., 2013) and placed
methylation proportion differences of various intensities.
Specifically, we chose one sample from the experiment to serve as
the control (the cortex sample), and kept the methylation proportion
of each CpG site of the control sample the same as the original data.
Another sample from the experiment (the brain sample) was served
as the case, where the methylation proportions of each CpG site
were simulated. To simplify the simulation, without loss of general—
ity we only focused on chromosome 19. In total, we put 400 DMRs

on chromosome 19 with half of the DMRs up—regulated and the other
half down—regulated. Because of the fact that the length of DMRs re—
ported in the literature usually ranges from a few hundreds to a few
thousands bps (Sun et al., 2014), the lengths of the DMRs were
sampled from a truncated Gaussian distribution (L N N (150. 1002),
with 50 < L < 4000). Within each DMR, the fraction of DMCs
were varied from 0.7 to 1, and for each DMC the differences in
methylation proportions between the case and control samples were
varied from 0.1 to 0.4. For the other CpG sites, the methylation pro—
portions in the case sample were set the same as those in the control
sample. The number of methylated reads for each CpG site in both
case and control samples were simulated from binomial distribution
with the total number of reads at each CpG site equal to the total
number of reads from each sample at the same CpG site. For each of
the simulated model, we generated 50 replicates, and we analyzed
each replicate by using the proposed GetisDMR method and the
ComMet method (Saito et al., 2014).

3.2 Scenario II

In the second set of simulations, we evaluated the performance of
GetisDMR under a variety of conditions where biological replicates
were available, and we further compared the performance of
GetisDMR with ComMet, BSmooth and DSS (Feng et al., 2014;
Hansen et al., 2012; Saito et al., 2014). Similar to Scenario 1, we
used a real dataset from a WGBS experiment to mimic the methyla—
tion proportions and the spatial correlations between adjacent CpG
sites (Hon et al., 2013). We randomly chose 6 samples to serve as
control samples, and the remaining samples to serve as case samples.
The methylation proportions in control samples were set the same
as the methylation proportion in one of the randomly selected con—
trol sample. Similar to Scenario I, we put 400 DMRs on chromo—
some 19 with half of the DMRs up—regulated and the remaining
down—regulated. The lengths of the DMRs were sampled from a
truncated Gaussian distribution (L N N(150. 1002), with
50 < L < 4000). Within each DMR, we varied the fraction (rang—
ing from 0.7 to 1) of DMCs and the differences (ranging from 0.2 to
0.3) in methylation proportions between cases and controls. For
non—differentially methylated regions, the methylation proportions
in the case samples were set the same as those in the control samples.
The number of methylated reads for each CpG site in both case and
control samples were simulated from binomial distribution with the
total number of reads at each CpG site equal to the total number of
reads from each sample at the same CpG site. For each scenario con—
sidered we generated 50 replicates, and analyzed each replicate by
using the proposed method, the ComMet (Saito et al., 2014), the
BSmooth (Hansen et al., 2012) and the DSS (Feng et al., 2014).

3.3 Scenario III

In this set of simulations, we evaluated the performance of the pro—
posed method when confounders/covariates were present. Similar to
Scenario II, 6 samples were served as controls, and the remaining
samples were served as cases. The methylation proportions at each

ranging from 0.1 to 0.5. The MO), for control samples was set at

was set at 0.2 or 0.3. The H1), for the other sites in the case samples
was set at log<1§ﬁ> (i.e. d: 0). Within each DMR, the fraction of
DMCs was set at 0.8. Similar to Scenario II, we put 400 DMRs on
the data, and the lengths of DMRs were sampled from
L ~N(150.1002), with 50 < L < 4000. For each scenario con—
sidered we generated 50 replicates, and analyzed each replicate by
using the proposed GetisDMR method, the ComMet (Saito et al.,
2014), the BSmooth (Hansen et al., 2012) and the DSS (Feng et al.,

2014).

4Resuﬂs

4.1 Scenariol

The sensitivity and PPV of Scenario I are summarized in Figure 1
(the differences in methylation proportions are 0.2 and 0.3) and
Supplementary Figure 52 (the differences in methylation proportions
are 0.1 and 0.4). As expected, with the increase in the differences of
methylation proportions between the case and control groups, the
sensitivity and PPV increased for both of the methods. For example,
with 90% DMCs in a DMR, the sensitivity of GetisDMR increased
from 0.0063 to 0.51 and the PPV increased from 0.29 to 0.92 as the
differences in methylation proportions increased from 0.1 to 0.4.
Similarly, the sensitivity of ComMet increased from 0.0022 to 0.22
and the PPV increased from 0.017 to 0.78 as the differences in
methylation proportions increased. Consistent with what we had ex—
pected, as the fraction of DMCs in a DMR increased, the sensitivity
and PPV increased as well. It is worth noting that when the differ—
ences in methylation proportions are small, the increase in the frac—
tion of DMCs within a DMR increases both the sensitivity and PPV
for GetisDMR, while it has little effect on ComMet (Supplementary
Fig. 52). This could be largely explained by the fact that when biolo—
gical replicates are not available, GetisDMR utilizes spatial correl—
ations between z—scores (calculated from the Fisher’s Exact Test)
from nearby CpG sites to stabilize the estimators (CZ) and thus
boosts the power for DMR detection. As shown in Figure 1, both
the sensitivity and PPV of the proposed GetisDMR method were sig—
nificantly higher than those of ComMet under all the situations con—
sidered in this set of simulations. We also varied the definition of a
true positive DMR to assess the performance of the proposed model.
Specifically, we evaluated and compared the sensitivity and PPV be—
tween the two methods with 10%, 25%, 75% and 90% overlaps.
The trends are similar to Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S2 (sup
plementary Table 51 ).

4.2 Scenario ||

The sensitivity and PPV of Scenario II are summarized in Figure 2.
Similar to the results from Scenario I, both sensitivity and PPV
increased with the increase in the fraction of DMCs and the differ—
ences of methylation proportions. As expected, given the same level
of differences in methylation proportions and DMC fractions, both
the sensitivity and PPV were higher when biological replicates were
available. We noticed that while the PPV of GetisDMR was always
significantly higher than that of ComMet, the sensitivity of
GetisDMR was slightly lower than that of ComMet when the differ—
ences of methylation proportion were relatively high. This is partly
due to the fact that when biological replicates are available, the
GetisDMR takes both the biological and sampling variations into
account. However, under the setting of Scenario II, the methylation
proportions were set the same for all the samples in each group (i.e.
no biological variability), indicating a binomial distribution should
be sufficient to model the data. However, GetisDMR assumes there

is biological variability and estimates an additional parameter to ac—
count for it, which could result in the loss of efficiency. On contrary,
ComMet assumes no biological variability and pools together sam—
ples under the same experimental condition, which boosts the power
of DMR detection under the current setting. Indeed, when there is
no biological variability, a logistic regression has higher power than
that of the beta—binomial regression. However, in most of cases we
do not know if the biological variability is present, and failing to
consider such a variation can result in false positive findings
(Scenario III). Nevertheless, as the differences in sensitivity between
the two methods are not substantial (Fig. 2), we recommend to use
the beta—binomial regression to account for the potential biological
variability. The BSmooth method attained lower sensitivity and PPV
than both of the proposed GetisDMR method and the ComMet
method among all the situations except the case when the difference
in methylation proportions was small (i.e. d : 0.1, results are shown
in Supplementary Fig. S3). While the sensitivity of the DSS method
was lower than both GetisDMR and the ComMet, the PPV of the
DSS method was higher than that of the ComMet and BSmooth
methods but lower than that of the GetisDMR method. We also var—
ied the definition of a true positive DMR and evaluated the sensitiv—
ity and PPV with 10%, 25%, 75% and 90% overlaps. The trends
are similar to Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S3 (Supplementary
Table 52). In summary, GetisDMR has significantly lower rate of
false positive findings, and it has higher or comparable sensitivity
among all the situations considered in this set of simulations.

4.3 Scenario Ill

The sensitivity and PPV of Scenario III are summarized in Figure 3.
As expected, with the increase in the effects of covariates, both the
sensitivity and PPV for ComMet decreased. For example, when the
odds ratio (OR) for the binary confounding variable changed from
1.11 (log OR:0.1) to 1.65 (log OR:0.5), with 80% CpG sites
being differentially methylated within a DMR and the differences in
methylation proportion setting at 0.3, the sensitivity for ComMet
changed from 0.83 to 0.75 and the PPV changed from 0.32 to 0.19,
whereas under the same setting the sensitivity for GetisDMR
changed from 0.87 to 0.86 and the PPV changed from 0.81 to 0.80.
The performance of GetisDMR is largely robust against the presence

of other confounding variables, and this could be explained by the
fact that GetisDMR adopts a beta—binomial regression in which the
covariates can be explicitly modeled. When other factors (e.g. age)
affect the methylation proportions, the treatment effect estimates
can be substantially biased when such factors are not taken into ac—
count. The ComMet method ignores the potential confounding ef—
fects, and pools the data under the same experiment condition
together into one sample. Therefore, it is subject to low power as the
confounding effects increase. Similar to Scenario II, the BSmooth
method performed worse than ComMet and GetisDMR, but its per—
formance was relative robust against confounding effects. DSS
method tended to have higher PPV than ComMet and BSmooth, but
its sensitivity was lower than those of the ComMet and the BSmooth
methods in most of the cases. Similar results hold when 100% CpG
sites are differentially methylated within a DMR region
(Supplementary Fig. S4). We also varied the definition of a true posi—
tive DMR (i.e. overlap proportions are set at 10%, 25%, 75% and
90%), and the trends are similar to Figure 3 and Supplementary
Figure S4 (Supplementary Table S3). Among all the situations con—
sidered in this set of simulations, the GetisDMR had higher sensitiv—
ity and PPV than all the other methods regardless of the effects of
confounding variables, the differences in methylation proportions
and the fraction of DMCs within a DMR.

5 Real data application

5.1 The mouse bone marrow and kidney dataset

We applied the GetisDMR method to a public available mouse data—
set (Hon et al., 2013) to investigate the methylation patterns in bone
marrow and kidney tissues of adult mice. The dataset (GEO ID:
GSE42836) includes the base—resolution methylomes of 17 mouse
adult tissues spanning all three germ layers. Hon et al. found that
most tissue—specific DMRs occur at distal cis—regulatory elements,
and some tissue—specific DMRs mark vestigial enhancers that are
dormant in adult tissues but active in embryonic development. They
estimated that more than 6.7% of the mouse genome is variably
methylated (Hon et al., 2013). In our study, we only focus on com—
paring the methylation patterns between bone marrow and kidney
tissues of adult mice. In data preprocessing, the segemhl (Otto et al.,

2012) software was used to map the single—end reads to mm9 gen—
ome, and only reads with unique mapping positions were kept for
further analyses. The hits on the positive and negative strand cyto—
sine at one CpG site were summed together to get the total number
of reads and methylated reads. In total, our GetisDMR method has
detected 116,912 DMRs. The median length of the identified DMR
is 458 bp, and the median number of CpG sites within a DMR is 8
(the details of the identified regions were summarized in supplemen
tary file 1). To investigate whether the identified DMRs are located
in the genomic regions that are relevant to the normal functioning or
development of kidney and/or bone marrow, the Genomic Regions
Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT) was used to infer the
biological functions based on identified DMRs with more than 15
CpG sites harbored (11:15 172). Two types of annotations, gene ex—
pressions at different tissues of various mouse development stages
and the mouse phenotypes that are affected upon gene malfunction—
ing, were used to explore the biological functions. We further
ranked the significance of enrichment according to the binomial
distribution—based P—values obtained from the GREAT analyses.
The details of the analyses are summarized in Supplementary file 2.
Using gene expression annotation, we found that the genes presum—
ably controlled by the detected DMRs tended to be over—expressed
in kidney or bone marrow tissues. Among the top terms, TS23_vis—
ceral organ, TS23_metanephros, TS23_renal—urinary system and
TS23_renal cortex, are related to the forming of normal kidney
structures during mouse development at Theiler stage (TS) 23.
Among the top 25 combinations of tissues and development stages
that exhibit the most significant enrichment, 60% of them are
related to kidney or bone marrow systems (Fig. 4A). About 50%
terms are directly related to kidney or bone marrow functioning
even tracing down to the 60th term (Supplementary Fig. 55A). Using
phenotype annotation, we found that genes located on or near the
detected DMRs were even more enriched in either bone marrow or
kidney systems. Among the top 25 terms, 80% of them are directly
related to the two tissues (Fig. 43). About 80% of the terms are
related to the two tissues when we trace down to the 60th term
(Supplementary Fig. SSB).

For comparison purposes, we also analyzed this dataset using the
ComMet method. GREAT database was used to explore the biolo—
gical functions of the identified DMRs. The percentages of

confounder, such as age and gender, and thus it is important to take
these confounding variables into consideration to avoid bias effect
estimates. The beta—binomial regression model can account for bio—
logical variability and therefore reduces the rate of false positives
compared with a standard logistic regression model. Compared with
the beta regression model, which is a widely used technique to
model outcomes within the range between 0 and 1, the beta—
binomial regression increases power even at moderate coverage as it
takes the coverage depth into consideration.

Another strength of our method is that the GetisDMR adopts
region—wise test statistics based on local Getis—Ord statistics to dir—
ectly detect DMRs. Currently, most of the existing methods focus
on detecting DMCs and then identify DMRs based on some pre—
specified empirical criteria. Although GetisDMR can be used to de—
tect DMCs as we performed the beta—binomial regression for each
CpG site independently, our method focuses on detecting DMRs
directly and provides statistical inference for direct DMR detection.
It has been reported by various researchers that DNA—methylation
proportions are spatially correlated along the genome (Eckhardt
et al., 2006; Irizarry et al., 2008), and our own data shows that the
P—values from the beta—binomial regression are also spatially corre—
lated. In the GetisDMR method, we first derived a z—score and then
we employed the local Getis—Ord statistics to account for the spatial
correlation in DMR detection. Detecting DMRs from WGBS data is
similar to that of hot spot detection, where local Getis—Ord statistics
have been widely used. Indeed, most of the local Getis—Ord statistics
calculated based on the z—scores are approximately normally distrib—
uted as most of the CpG sites are not DMCs. Any regions with
abnormal large or small local Getis—Ord statistics may indicate a
spatial hot spot and in our case it indicates a DMR. One of the
challenges of defining the local Getis—Ord statistics is to calibrate the
spatial correlation among z—scores. Although spatial correlations de—
crease with the increase in the distance between CpG sites, the mag—
nitude of the correlation is quite data dependent. In our method,
instead of pre—specifying a weight function to account for the
correlation, we use a kernel function to capture this relationship and
let the data to determine the magnitude of the parameters.
This makes our method robust to various datasets with different
underlying spatial correlation structures. We further showed the
asymptotic distribution of the region—wise test statistic (i.e.
6* ~ MVN(0.E)), and controlled the region—wise false discovery
rate. Therefore, our method can well control the false positive rate
and it provides statistical inference not only for DMCs but also for
DMRs.

It is worth mentioning that the proposed method is quite flexible
to the study designs as the DMR detection only requires P—values.
For example, for studies where replicates are not available, the
Fisher’s Exact Test could be used to calculate P—values for each CpG
site. We could then use the same procedure to detect DMRs. For
studies with more than 2 treatment groups, the likelihood ratio tests
could be performed to assess the treatment effects and the same local
Getis—Ord statistic based procedure could be used to detect DMRs.
For longitudinal studies or studies with clustered effects, robust esti—
mation of the beta—binomial model parameters can be used and the
same local Getis—Ord statistic based procedure could be employed to
infer DMRs (Pashkevich and Kharin, 2004).

In real data application, we applied the proposed method to two
public available mouse datasets (Hon et al., 2013; Lister et al.,
2013). The first dataset is designed to investigate methylation pro—
portions at different tissues of mouse, and it only has one sample per
tissue (i.e. one sample from the bone marrow tissue and one sample
from the kidney tissue) (Hon et al., 2013). In total, our method

detected 1 16 912 DMRs. Further analyses using the GREAT tool re—
vealed that most of genes located either on or close to the identified
DMRs are related to kidney or bone marrow systems. Using gene ex—
pression annotation, about 50% terms selected by the GREAT is
related to the two tissues. Similarly, using the phenotype annotation,
80% of terms are directly associated with the two tissues. We also
applied our method to compare methylation proportions between
neuron and non—neuron samples from mouse frontal cortex (Lister
et al., 2013), where the effects of age and gender have been con—
trolled for. In total, we have detected 371 092 DMRs and most of
them are biologically relevant. Using the GREAT, the percentages of
terms directly related to neural systems reach 73% and 57% for
gene expression and mouse phenotype annotations, respectively. In
both scenarios, the DMRs detected by the GetisDMR method
showed significant enrichment of genes in the desired tissues, as well
as the direct association with the expected mouse phenotypes.
Although further studies are needed to confirm the biological func—
tions of these detected DMRs, our findings shed light on the methyl—
ation patterns in different mouse tissues.

In conclusion, we have developed a powerful method to detect
DMRs for the analysis of WGBS datasets. The GetisDMR method
detects DMRs based on region—wise statistics, that utilize the spatial
correlations between nearby CpG sites. Our method achieves high
sensitivity and PPV, and it has the potential to be applicable for
more sophisticated study designs, and studies without biological
replicates.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The recent shift towards high-throughput screening is
posing new challenges for the interpretation of experimental results.
Here we propose the cleverSuite approach for large-scale character-
ization of protein groups.

Description: The central part of the cleverSuite is the cleverMachine
(CM), an algorithm that performs statistics on protein sequences by
comparing their physico-chemical propensities. The second element
is called cleverClassifier and builds on top of the models generated by
the CM to allow classification of new datasets.

Results: We applied the cleverSuite to predict secondary structure
properties, solubility, chaperone requirements and RNA-binding abil-
ities. Using cross-validation and independent datasets, the cleverSuite
reproduces experimental findings with great accuracy and provides
models that can be used for future investigations.

Availability: The intuitive interface for dataset exploration, analysis
and prediction is available at http://s.tartaglialab.com/clever_suite.

1 INTRODUCTION

Due to the latest advances in technology, a large number of
sequences have been deposited into databases (Harrow et al.,
2012; Wang et al., 2012) and computational methods are being
developed for their analysis and interpretation (Bailey et al.,
2009; Dinkel et al., 2013). Some algorithms require per-case con-
ﬁguration (Buchan et al., 2013) or lack intuitive interface (Rost,
1996), which prohibits diffusion among non-computational
scientists.

Experimental scales encoding physico-chemical properties are
useful to retrieve basic information on protein sequences
(Wilkins et al., 1999) and to predict features associated with
protein folding (Gao et al., 2010; Tartaglia and Vendruscolo,
2010), aggregation (Fernandez-Escamilla et al., 2004; Tartaglia
et al., 2008) and molecular interactions (Cirillo et al., 2013;

Muppirala et al., 2011). For instance, the Zyggregator method
predicts aggregation propensity using a combination of physico-
chemical properties including secondary structure, solvent acces-
sibility, hydrophobicity and polarity (Tartaglia and Vendruscolo,
2008). Similarly, the SVMprot algorithm exploits amino acid
properties to predict protein families annotated in Pfam (Cai
et al., 2003). Indeed, experimental scales can be employed to
investigate large-scale properties of proteomes and identify
common features (Hlevnjak et al., 2012; Zanzoni et al., 2013)
but no systematic approach has been attempted so far to provide
a general-purpose algorithm. We aim to provide researchers with
an intuitive and statistically robust method to characterize pro-
tein groups exploiting the information contained in primary
structure. Our premise is that the user should be able to make
multiple hypotheses on the training sets and build models
that others can test. As a general-purpose universal optimization
is theoretically impossible (Ho and Pepyne, 2002), our strategy is
to build a class of predictors that are speciﬁc for the individual
problems. We pay particular attention to derive unbiased models
because over-ﬁtting of internal parameters can undermine the
general applicability of algorithms (Hawkins, 2004; Tartaglia
et al., 2004).

Our approach, the cleverSuite, provides a series of easy-to-use,
conﬁguration-free tools with interactive graphical interface. The
central part of the suite is the cleverMachine (CM), an algorithm
to characterize protein datasets. CM does not require external
ﬁtting parameters and returns multiple physico-chemical proper-
ties ranked by their signiﬁcance. Relevant properties are merged
together to provide coherent and consistent classiﬁcation, allow-
ing complex feature analysis. The second element of our suite is
the cleverClassiﬁer (CC) that builds on top of results generated
by the CM to allow classiﬁcation of protein datasets using state
of the art machine-learning approaches (Pedregosa et al., 2011).
CM and CC algorithms are freely available at http://s.tartaglia
lab.com/page/clever_suite.

We illustrate the powerfulness of our approach by making
predictions of several protein features, including structural dis-
order (Sickmeier et al., 2007), solubility (Niwa et al., 2009), chap-
erone interactions (Calloni et al., 2012; Kerner et al., 2005) and
RNA-binding abilities (Baltz et al., 2012; Castello et al., 2012).

2 METHODS
2.1 The cleverMachine

The algorithm evaluates relative difference in physico-chemical properties
between two provided datasets. The ﬁrst dataset is considered to be posi-
tive (P) and the second negative (N). The operations of the algorithm
consist of multiple stages 03ig. 1).

2.1.1 Data generation The raw information is extracted from protein
sequences using experimental physico-chemical propensities. Our curated
database contains 80 physico-chemical propensities, derived from experi-
mental data [e.g. hydrophobicity (Black and Mould, 1991; Bull and
Breese, 1974; Fauchere and Pliska, 1983)] and statistics on computational
tools. Physico—chemical propensities are organized into groups based on
higher level properties (Fig. 2 and Supplementry Fig. Sl). At present, we
use eight classes (hydrophobicity, alpha-helix, beta-sheet, disorder, burial,
aggregation, membrane and nucleic acid-binding propensities), but add-
itional descriptors are allowed (see Section 2.3). For a given propensity,
each protein sequence is scanned using a sliding window, moved one
residue at a time, starting from the N-terminus (protein profile). The
size of the sliding window is set to 7 amino acids to allow best discrim-
ination between alpha helix (hydrogen bonding in the range i + 3 —> i
and i + 5 —> i) and beta sheet (strands between 3—10 amino acids) elem-
ents, but it can be modiﬁed.

2.1.2 Signal detection For each property, we count how many proteins
from one dataset have proﬁles enriched with respect to the other dataset:

coverage (P, N) = P: t2  19(er — an) — a) (1)
o P o n

In Equation (1), 71 is the signal extracted from the protein proﬁle, the
counter 19(x — y) is 1 if x> y and 0 otherwise and Ptot and Ntot are the
total number of sequences in P and N datasets. The internal parameter a
is a cut-off used in the counting (see Section 2.1.6). The coverage is
calculated for all proteins from both datasets and individual scale enrich-
ments (i.e. fractions of P and N that can be discriminated) are calculated.
For each physico-chemical propensity, the algorithm estimates the area
under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). In the ﬁve cases
reported in this article, AUC and coverage(P, N) show more than 0.85
correlation 03ig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2). As AUC is cut-off inde-
pendent, the high correlation indicates that coverage(P, N) depends only
weakly on a. It is important to mention that the ROC analysis is not
deﬁned in multiple dimensions Gui and Fine, 2008), while different phy-
sico—chemical properties can be combined into an overall coverage.
Coverage of 50% indicates that half of the dataset is differentially
enriched (expectation for a random set is 25% corresponding to 0.5 of
AUC; Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2).

2.1.3 Properties selection and combination To calculate the signiﬁ-
cance of each physico-chemical property, P and N are merged together and
shufﬂed sets matching P and N in size are extracted. The procedure is
repeated R times. For each of the randomized dataset pairs, we estimate
the coverage. Information from the random dataset discrimination is used
to rank properties signiﬁcance using Z—scores and their associated P-values
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Properties not meeting the criteria Z—score > Z“,

Fig. 3. Correlation between coverage and AUC. For the ﬁve cases pre-
sented in this study, AUC and coverage of individual physico-chemical
properties show a correlation r>0.85. In this example, we use human

and P-value < 0.01 are excluded from the analysis. Using 500 random sets,
we observe that optimal values are Zlh= 6 and R = 15. To check consis-
tencies among predictors of the same physico-chemical propensity, we
group the properties by higher level features and also highlight the ones
that pass the selection criteria (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1). For each
combination of properties ranging from 1 to 5 (~107 alternatives), the
overall coverage (union of individual coverages) is calculated and the
best-performing set is selected (Fig. 4). We observe that some physico-
chemical properties are correlated. Nevertheless, since the algorithm selects
only the most discriminative combination of properties, correlation does
not represent a limitation. In fact, if two properties produce overlapping

lists of proteins, their combination creates smaller coverage compared to
scales that are more different.

2.1.4 Model generation In order to identify the best model for fur-
ther set classiﬁcation, the algorithm evaluates combination of scales with
multiple machine learning methodologies. The selected classiﬁers include
random forests, support vector machine, nearest neighbour and adaptive
boosting algorithms (Pedregosa et al., 2011). To avoid set size bias, we
perform multiple equal size samplings from each of the datasets.
Moreover, we perform 10-fold cross-validation with each of the models
to select the best performing (highest accuracy) algorithm.

2.2 The cleverClassiﬁer

The main goal is the set-wide assignment of query X to either P or N set
from the reference submission (Fig. 1). The prediction is carried out using
the best model evaluated on reference data. CD-HIT (Fu et al., 2012)
algorithm is employed to detect set sequence similarity of X with respect
to reference. If the similarity exceeds 10%, the value is reported to the
user. Random sets generated with the same AA composition as the ref-
erence sets are employed to estimate signal strength, which is defined as
the difference between performance of set X (i.e. fraction of cases that can
be classiﬁed) and random sets. Signal strength ranges between 0 (no en-
richment) to 0.5 (strong signal) (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). For
each of the entries from dataset X, individual physico-chernical proﬁles
(Supplementary Fig. S4) are reported together with element assignment
to either P or N. Moreover, for each individual prediction we estimate
prediction strength using consensus from cross-validation models.

2.3 Additional features

(i) Custom scales: if the ‘expert mode’ option is selected in the webserver,
the user can submit up to 10 amino acid scales for CM calculations. As
CM employs 10 scales for each physico-chemical group (e.g. hydropho-
bicity) we suggest a similar approach for the choice of additional scales.
Custom scales do not need to be normalized.

(ii) Derived scale: at every run, CM produces an ad hoc scale derived
from the input sets (‘expert mode’). The scale is measured by considering
the frequency of each amino acid a in both sets P and N:

Aﬂa) =fp(a) -f1v(a) (2)
In Equation (2), amino acid frequencies are normalized:

Zafp(a) = ZafN(a) = 1. The derived scale can be used in CC runs
(see (i) above).

(iii) Adaptive threshold: the optimal cut-off or corresponds to the highest
coverage with respect to shuffled sets:

1
or : max [coverage(P, N) — R Z coverage(P,, N,):| (3)

The number of shufﬂed sets P, and N, is R = 15. If the ‘expert mode’
option is selected, the algorithm optimizes or for the input sets. In the
‘norrnal run’ mode, the cut-off is or = 0.75 (Supplementary Fig. S5).

(iv) Peak detection: the coverage can be computed using (a) the average
of physico-chemical proﬁles or (b) regions that deviate more than one
standard deviation from the average score. Average score and standard
deviation are estimated from the distribution of proﬁles (considering both
positive and negative sets). The use of a threshold, previously imple-
mented for the calculation of aggregation properties (Tartaglia and
Vendruscolo, 2008), introduces a sequence-position dependency in the
calculation of proﬁles.

3 RESULTS

A sketch describing CM and CC workﬁow is presented in
Figure 1. The goal of the CM algorithm is to discriminate be-
tween two protein sets. A number of properties, including hydro-
phobicity, alpha-helical, beta-sheet, disorder, burial, aggregation,
membrane and nucleic acid-binding propensities, are employed
to build physicochemical ‘proﬁles’. The physico-chemical proper-
ties are combined together to identify similarities and differences
between the two sets. Once the discriminating properties are
characterized, CM generates a model, which is employed by
CC to classify new datasets. As shown in the examples below,
we tested CM and CC performances on protein features such as
secondary structure, structural disorder, solubility, chaperone re-
quirements and RNA-binding ability (Supplementary Table S1).
Unless otherwise stated, we always remove overlap between
training and test sets using CD-HIT with default cut-off set for
sequence similarity (Fu et al., 2012).

3.1 Alpha-helix versus beta-sheet proteins

In this first introductory example, we trained CM to distinguish
between alpha-helical and beta-sheet proteins. The PDB data-
base (Bernstein et al., 1977) was used to retrieve protein struc-
tures, STRIDE (Heinig and Frishman, 2004) was applied to
analyse alpha-helical and beta-sheet content and CD-HIT (Fu
et al., 2012) was employed to ﬁlter out sequences with >50%
identity. After sequence redundancy removal, the alpha-helical
set consisted of 277 proteins adopting >80% of alpha-helical
conformation while the beta-sheet set was comprised of 191 pro-
teins containing >60% of beta-sheet content. Sequences coding
for alpha-helical structures were used to build the positive set,
while the negative set consisted of beta-sheet proteins.

3.1.1 Performances In striking agreement with structural clas-
sification, we found that even a single physico-chemical scale of
alpha-helical propensity (Deleage and Roux, 1987) is able to
discriminate 98% of the two sets with a 99.0% accuracy and
100% precision (Table 1). Hence, CM shows ideal performances
in separating alpha-helical and beta-sheet proteins. All alpha-
helical scales (Burgess et al., 1974; Chou and Fasman, 1978;
Kanehisa and Tsong, 1980) showed consistent enrichment in
the positive set, while the beta propensity scales displayed signiﬁ-
cant enrichment in the negative set (the signal is strong with
respect to permutated input sets with P—Value<0.01) (Chou

3.1.2 Cross-validation Through a 10-fold cross-validation on
both sets, our CM showed accuracy of 97.9% (Table 1). When
compared to random sets, the signal strength was 0.5
(Supplementary Table S2). CM selected AdaBoost (Pedregosa

calculation.

3.1.3 Independent validations We downloaded alpha/beta
proteins from SCOP (Andreeva et al., 2008). After redundancy
removal (CD-HIT 50), the alpha-helical set consisted of 176 pro-
teins adopting >80% of alpha-helical conformation while the
beta-sheet set was comprised of 79 proteins containing >60%
of beta-sheet content. Our predictions showed accuracy of
90.4% for alpha-helical (positive set) and 93.2% for beta-sheet
(negative set) assignments (Table 1). The testing sets achieved
separation from random of 0.4 (alpha-helix) and 0.4 (beta-
sheet). On the same datasets, the RePROF (Rost, 1996) algo-
rithm yielded accuracies of 92.6% (alpha-helical proteins) and
72.1% (beta-sheet proteins; Table 1 and Supplementary
Material). As an additional test we used NetSurfP (Petersen
et al., 2009) that achieved accuracy of 96% (alpha-helical pro-
teins) and 64% (beta-sheet proteins).

The cleversuite approach for protein characterization

 

3.2 Structural disorder

It has been shown that natively unfolded proteins are implicated
in cellular regulation, signalling and assembly of macromolecular
complexes (Dunker et al., 2002). Absence of native structure has
functional implications for complex organisms (Koonin et al.,
2002). In fact, higher eukaryotes show larger amount of intrin-
sically disordered proteins with respect to prokaryotes (Tartaglia
et al., 2005). We applied our algorithm to intrinsically disordered
proteins [positive set containing 630 proteins from DisProt
(Sickmeier et al., 2007)] and structured proteins [negative set
containing 3347 proteins from SCOP (Andreeva et al., 2008)].

3 .2.1 Performances CM identiﬁes disorder as the most discrim-
inative physico-chemical property: TOP-IDB and DisProt cover
respectively 65.5% and 61.0% (Campen et al., 2008; Sickmeier
et al., 2007). We found that disordered proteins are more hydro-
philic and soluble. Indeed, the coverage is 50% for hydrophobi-
city [corresponding to 0.7 of AUC (Eisenberg et al., 1984)], 45%
for aggregation (Tartaglia and Vendruscolo, 2010) and 42% for
burial (Harpaz et al., 1994). The CM achieves optimal perform-
ances by combining the scales for disorder (Sickmeier et al.,
2007), hydrophobicity (Eisenberg et al., 1984), burial (Harpaz
et al., 1994), aggregation (Tartaglia and Vendruscolo, 2010)
and alpha-helix (Kanehisa and Tsong, 1980) (sensitivity of 0.9
and false positive rate of 0.07).

3.2.2 Cross-validation Through a 10-fold cross-validation on
both sets, our CM showed accuracy of 86.7% (Table 1). When
compared to random sets, the signal strength was 0.4
(Supplementary Table S2). The best performing classiﬁer for
this case was Extremely Randomized Trees (Pedregosa et al.,
2011), a variant of the Random Forest ensemble classiﬁer.

3.2.3 Independent validations As a positive set we used a data-
base of yeast prions that are enriched in structural disorder
[27 entries after sequence redundancy removal (Alberti et al.,
2009)]. The negative set was comprised of a manually curated
database of structured proteins whose folded native state has
been studied in vitro [44 entries after sequence redundancy re-
moval (Tartaglia and Vendruscolo, 2010)]. Our predictions
showed accuracy of 84.5% for prions and 73.6% for structured
proteins (Table 1). The testing sets achieved separation from
random of 0.4 (prions) and 0.2 (structured proteins). On the
same datasets, the FoldIndex (Prilusky et al., 2005) algorithm
yielded accuracies of 62.9% (prions) and 64.7% (structured pro-
teins; Table 1 and Supplementary Material). In addition, we em-
ployed NetSurfP (Petersen et al., 2009) and observed accuracies
of 88.8% (prions) and 63.7% (structured proteins).

3.3 Solubility

A number of proteins such as fragile X mental retardation pro-
tein FMRP, TAReDNA-binding protein 43 TDP43, fused in
sarcoma FUS and prions have a strong propensity to aggregate
into amyloid ﬁbrils (Cirillo et al., 2013). Hence, prediction of
protein solubility is fundamental to understand functional (e.g.
RNA-binding) and dysfunctional (e.g. aggregated) states. To
build a predictor of protein solubility, we took advantage of a
study in which the solubility of 70% of Escherichia coli proteins
was experimentally measured using an in vivo translation system

(Niwa et al., 2009). In this analysis, we ranked proteins by their
solubility and used top (1000 soluble proteins) and bottom (1000
insoluble proteins) elements as the positive and negative sets
(Agostini et al., 2012).

3.3.1 Performances In agreement with experimental evidence
(Niwa et al., 2009), we found that hydrophobicity (Fauchere
and Pliska, 1983; Sweet and Eisenberg, 1983) (coverage of
5457%), aggregation (Conchillo—Solé et al., 2007) (coverage of
49%) and burial (Wertz and Scheraga, 1978) (coverage of 58%)
propensities are depleted in the positive set while disorder
(Campen et al., 2008) (coverage of 50%) and alpha-helix
(Kanehisa and Tsong, 1980) (coverage of 41%) propensities
are enriched (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). By selecting
the scales for disorder (Bhaskaran and Ponnuswamy, 1988;
Monne et al., 1999), burial (Argos et al., 1982; Chothia, 1975)
and alpha-helix (Burgess et al., 1974) the algorithm reported op-
timal performances associated with sensitivity of 0.96 and false
positive rate of 0.07 (Fig. 4).

3.3.2 Cross-validation Through a 10-fold cross-validation on
both sets, our CM showed accuracy of 89.7% (Table 1). When
compared to random sets, the signal strength was 0.5
(Supplementary Table S2). In this case, Random Forest classiﬁer
(Pedregosa et al., 2011) was selected as the best performing.

3.3.3 Independent validations As positive set we used proteins
whose folding kinetics and thermodynamics have been studied
in vitro [71 non-redundant entries (Tartaglia and Vendruscolo,
2010)]. The negative set contained proteins requiring molecular
chaperones to fold into native structure [81 entries (Kerner et al.,
2005)]. Our predictions showed accuracy of 84.7% for the posi-
tive set and 60.5% for the negative. The testing achieved separ-
ation from random of 0.5 (soluble proteins) and 0.1 (insoluble
proteins). On the same datasets, PROSO II (Smialowski et al.,
2012) algorithm yielded accuracies of 78.5% (positive set) and
74% (negative set; Table 1; Supplementary Material).

3.4 Chaperone requirements

Hsp70, the major stress-induced heat shock protein, facilitates
substrate folding into native state (Calloni et al., 2012; Hartl and
Hayer-Hartl, 2002) and is able to associate with AU-rich tran-
scripts (Kishor et al., 2013; Zimmer et al., 2001). Mass spectrom-
etry experiments show that E.coli DnaK interacts with proteins
lacking strong hydrophobic core or exposing regions that are
buried in the native state. In our analysis, the positive set was
composed of proteins that require DnaK/GroEL to fold prop-
erly (109 sequences) and the negative set consisted of independ-
ently folding proteins [39 sequences (Kerner et al., 2005)].

3.4.1 Performances Our results show strong agreement with
experimental findings, with proteins in the positive set having
low hydrophobic propensity [43% coverage (Eisenberg et al.,
1984)] but high burial propensity [68% coverage (Rose et al.,
1985)], which is consistent with the observation that lack of a
hydrophobic core prevents from folding into native state
(Tartaglia et al., 2010). In agreement with experimental evidence
(Zimmer et al., 2001), we found that the positive set is enriched in
proteins binding to nucleic acids (Zimmer et al., 2001; Calloni
et al., 2012; Kishor et al., 2013). By automatically combining the

P.Klus et al.

 

scales for nucleic acid binding (Lewis et al., 2011), burial (Argos
et al., 1982; Rose et al., 1985), membrane (Argos et al., 1982) and
hydrophobicity (Eisenberg et al., 1984) propensities, CM
achieved a sensitivity of 0.91 and false positive rate of 0.08.

3.4.2 Cross-validation Through a 10-fold cross-validation we
ﬁnd that CM has accuracy of 81.6% and separation from
random of 0.3 (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). The
best performance was achieved with the AdaBoost (Pedregosa
et al., 2011) classiﬁcation algorithm.

3.4.3 Independent validations The positive validation set was
comprised of proteins requiring chaperones to fold (81 entries)
(Kerner et al., 2005) while the negative validation was a manually
curated dataset of independently-folding proteins [71 non-redun-
dant entries (Tartaglia and Vendruscolo, 2010)]. The independ-
ent sets achieved accuracies of 75.4% for chaperone-dependent
set and 60% for independently folding proteins. The testing sets
achieved separations from random of 0.2 (chaperone-dependent
and -independent set). To compare our performance to existing
methods, we used Limbo (Van Durme et al., 2009) to predict
DnaK-binding afﬁnity of protein peptides. The method classiﬁed
100% of the positive set as chaperone-dependent (the accuracy
was 96% on the positive training set), and it achieved 22.5%
assignation accuracy on the independently folding dataset
(Table 1 and Supplementary Material).

3.5 RNA-binding abilities

Recent technological advances have made it possible to discover
that number of proteins have RNA-binding ability (Riley and
Steitz, 2013). We focused on RNA-interacting proteins (715
entries) detected with UV cCL and PAR-CL protocols on pro-
liferating HeLa cells and compared them with the cell lysate

[2831 entries after sequence redundancy removal (Castello
et al., 2012)].

3.5 .1 Performances The single property analysis revealed a
strong and consistent RNA-binding property of the dataset:
RNA-binding scales (Castello et al., 2012; Lewis et al., 2011;
Terribilini et al., 2006) cover between 62765%. Moreover, it
has been observed that protein disorder is an important feature
for RNA-binding proteins (Bellay et al., 2011; Cirillo et al.,
2014). In agreement with this result, we found a signiﬁcant en-
richment in disorder propensities (Bhaskaran and Ponnuswamy,
1988; Campen et al., 2008). CM automatically selects the scales
for RNA binding (Castello et al., 2012; Lewis et al., 2011), dis-
order (Campen et al., 2008; Isogai et al., 1980) and aggregation
propensities (Tartaglia et al., 2008) achieving a sensitivity of 0.91
and false positive rate of 0.07 on the entire dataset.

3.5.2 Cross-validation A 10-fold cross-validation on both data-
sets yielded accuracy of 84.3% and separation from random of
0.5 (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). The Extremely
Randomised Tree classiﬁer (Pedregosa et al., 2011) was selected
as the best performing algorithm for this case.

3.5.3 Independent validations The positive set contained pro-
teins identiﬁed as RNA-binding using quantitative proteomics
(Baltz et al., 2012). We removed any overlap between training
and test sets using CD-HIT (Fu et al., 2012), leaving the positive

set size to 86 entries. The negative validation contained 250 not
nucleic acid binding proteins (Shazman and Mandel-Gutfreund,
2008). Our predictions showed accuracy of 72.9% for the
mRNA-binding set and 79.2% for the negative validation. The
separation from internal random dataset was respectively 0.5 and
0.1 for the positive and negative testing sets. Using the same data
as for CC validation, the RNApred (Kumar et al., 2011)
achieved accuracy of 82.5% for the positive set and 52.8% for
the negative validation (Table 1; Supplementary Material).

4 DISCUSSION

The cleverSuite provides a novel and unique approach for both
characterization and classiﬁcation of protein groups. In striking
agreement with experimental evidence, we reported accurate
predictions of protein solubility in E.coli (Niwa et al., 2009),
RNA-binding ability in H. Sapiens (Castello et al., 2012), struc-
tural disorder (Sickmeier et al., 2007) and chaperone require-
ments (Kerner et al., 2005). Our performances are comparable
to other algorithms that were built to predict speciﬁc protein
features. In agreement with previous observations, we found
that physicochemical propensities linked to structural disorder
and are relevant for RNA-binding, chaperone requirement and
solubility (Agostini et al., 2012; Calloni et al., 2012; Cirillo et al.,
2014), which very well captures the central role of natively un-
folded proteins in higher eukaryotes (Babu et al., 2011). This
observation is further supported by direct comparison of
H.sapiens and E.coli proteomes, which shows enrichment in
hydrophobicity and aggregation propensity for E.coli and struc-
tural disorder for H.sapiens (all links to results are provided in
Supplementary Table S1).

Our findings suggest that the cleverSuite is an ideal tool to
analyse the outcome of large-scale experiments. As shown in
the examples, the algorithm can be applied to very diverse
types of cases to allow a ﬁne classiﬁcation of protein features
(Table 1). Future plans include incorporation of more properties
and alternative ways to extract the signal from protein profiles.
At present, the choice of propensity scales is mainly based on
their previous use but custom scales are allowed in the webserver.
We would like to note that our approach is not restricted to
propensity scales and that any function mapping a primary struc-
ture into a proﬁle could be interfaced with the algorithm. In next
version, we are planning to implement the projection of proﬁles
onto orthonormal bases, which should improve our
performances.

In the CM each physico-chemical property is described by
same number of propensity scales (eight groups containing 10
scales each; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3), which guarantees
that there is not over-representation of a particular property. We
stress that the algorithm is built in a way that only non-corre-
lated scales are selected for the analysis. In fact, if two scales
discriminate the same set of proteins, their combination together
would result in a smaller coverage compared to non-correlated
scales. The CM can compute up to 10 millions associations of
propensities (i.e. ﬁve scales out of 80 groups) to find the optimal
combination, which is computationally expensive but ensures an
impartial and exhaustive search. For this reason, the calculations
have been parallelized to complete the analysis in short time,
even when the input sets are large. We could have used other

The cleversuite approach for protein characterization

 

algorithms instead of the exhaustive search, but our focus is the
simple and clear interpretation of scale contributions, which is
not possible through more complex approaches.

We base our approach on the assumption that the algorithm
works optimally if the system is able to select its predictors with-
out external intervention (W olpert, 2002). Similarly to what has
been done to rationalize the determinants of protein aggregation
(Chiti et al., 2003), the cleverSuite identiﬁes the most relevant
properties for a speciﬁc problem with the main differences being
that: (i) fitting parameters are avoided and (ii) features are se-
lected from a large pool of physico-chemical characteristics.
Notably, the method allows the user to choose the reference
set, which is strategic to circumvent the problem of the lack of
negative cases in literature (Smialowski et al., 2010).

Although other useful tools are available to analyse protein
features (Hall et al., 2009; Rao et al., 2011), we did not ﬁnd any
general-purpose method to discriminate datasets using param-
eter-free combinations of physico-chemical characteristics and
we hope that our efforts will inspire future studies in the field.
In conclusion, the cleverSuites offers an easy-to-use interface,
accessible to a wide range of experimental and computational
scientists.

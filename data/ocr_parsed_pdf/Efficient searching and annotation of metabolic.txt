Abstract

Motivation: The urgent need for efficient and sustainable biological production of fuels and
high—value chemicals has elicited a wave of in silico techniques for identifying promising novel
pathways to these compounds in large putative metabolic networks. To date, these approaches
have primarily used general graph search algorithms, which are prohibitively slow as putative
metabolic networks may exceed 1 million compounds. To alleviate this limitation, we report two
methods—Simlndex (SI) and SimZyme—which use chemical similarity of 2D chemical fingerprints
to efficiently navigate large metabolic networks and propose enzymatic connections between the
constituent nodes. We also report a Byers—Waterman type pathway search algorithm for further
paring down pertinent networks.

Results: Benchmarking tests run with SI show it can reduce the number of nodes visited in search—
ing a putative network by 100—fold with a computational time improvement of up to 105—fold.
Subsequent Byers—Waterman search application further reduces the number of nodes searched by
up to 100—fold, while SimZyme demonstrates ~90% accuracy in matching query substrates with
enzymes. Using these modules, we have designed and annotated an alternative to the methylery—
thritol phosphate pathway to produce isopentenyl pyrophosphate with more favorable thermo—
dynamics than the native pathway. These algorithms will have a significant impact on our ability to
use large metabolic networks that lack annotation of promiscuous reactions.

1 Introduction

Metabolic reaction networks have been the focus of intense study in
recent years. Unravelling the topology of metabolic networks has
been used to gain a deeper understanding of metabolism, in addition
to identifying opportunities for engineering the production of drugs,
fuels, and chemicals. For this task, numerous in silico utilities, such
as metabolic ﬂux analysis (Orth et (11., 2010), have been developed
to optimize existing pathways, engineer novel pathways and identify
drug targets by simulating the effect of remodeling the underlying
metabolic network and analyzing its topology (Burgard et (11., 2003;
Cho et (11., 2010; Guimera et (11., 2007; Ranganathan et (11., 2010).

However, the emergence of evidence that many enzymes exhibit
promiscuous activities, acting on several different substrates or car—
rying out disparate reactions (Humble and Berglund, 2011; Nam
et (11., 2012; Nobeli et (11., 2009) tends to obfuscate the well—defined
topology of metabolic networks. The putative nodes and edges con—
tributed by these promiscuous activities to the metabolic network
both increase its overall size and number of unannotated edges.

We will focus on two significant challenges that exist in exploit—
ing the functionality of putative metabolic networks with potentially
nebulous topology. First, finding pathways in a metabolic network
linking two compounds, reactions or enzymes of interest is a

time—consuming task using traditional graph—searching algorithms
due to the large number of nodes in extant metabolic networks
(Yousofshahi et al., 2011). Hence, a more efficient mode of travers—
ing possible pathways to a specific target must be developed. Native
metabolic networks, such as that of iAF1260, are composed of N103
compound nodes, with an additional 103 reaction nodes (Feist et al.,
2007). Comprehensive reaction databases such as the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) also have a network—
like structure, and contains upwards of 15 000 compounds with
~8700 reactions (Altman et al., 2013). At the largest scale, putative
metabolic networks with sizes in excess of 107 compounds and reac—
tions can also be generated thanks to several computational tools
(Carbonell et al., 2012; Cho et al., 2010; Hatzimanikatis et al.,
2005). These algorithms use a library of generalized biochemical
transformations and apply them where possible to successive gener—
ations of compounds, starting with one or more compounds in the
zeroth generation. These computer—generated networks are useful
because they elucidate all potential transformations that can be per—
formed on a compound, which can be added to a growing putative
metabolic network containing numerous novel pathways to a
desired end product. Tools exist that can cap the size of putative net—
works (Kotera et al., 2014) by prescribing a putative number of
intermediate steps, but if a long pathway is predicted yielding net—
works with 107 nodes or more, the networks quickly become infeas—
ible to analyze, limiting our ability to discover and design novel
metabolic pathways.

A second challenge in exploiting large metabolic networks is
associating a given metabolic reaction with a specific enzyme or set
of enzymes capable of carrying out that reaction. Although most
biochemistry literature is built on the assumption that one enzyme
acts on one substrate, it is known that many similar substrates can
often be catalyzed by one particular enzyme (Humble and Berglund,
2011; Nobeli et al., 2009). An example of such a phenomenon is
acetate secretion in Escherichia coli strains that have had the acet—
ate—producing enzymes Pta/Ack and PoxB knocked out; enzyme
promiscuity has been conjectured to be the responsible factor in this
and similar situations with other metabolites (Perez—Gil et al., 2012;
Phue et al., 2010). This significant problem most likely occurs
on the genome scale as it is believed that ~40% of enzymes have
promiscuous function (Nam et al., 2012). This is most likely exacer—
bated in engineered cells, where enzyme and metabolite concentra—
tions may be far away from standard concentrations found through
evolution.

In addition, enzymes with similar sequences may catalyze reac—
tions on different substrates or have different activities for the same
set of substrates, thereby leading to improperly annotated genes.
In general, enzymes whose activity extends to substrates other than
their ‘native’ substrates will act on compounds with a similar struc—
ture or substructure. Determining which enzyme can fill these roles,
then, requires search algorithms that consider the molecular struc—
ture of the substrates.

Searching these networks with a basic depth— or breadth—first
search algorithm is time intensive and impractical for moderately
long pathways, and several algorithms have been developed to ex—
plore the space of known reactions in a probabilistic manner
(Yousofshahi et al., 2011; Rodrigo et al., 2008). In the past, much
success has been reported in using 2D chemical fingerprints in
exploring the substrate and inhibitory promiscuities of cytochrome
P4505 (Cheng et al., 2011; Nath et al., 2010; Terfloth et al., 2007)
and in assessing the verisimilitude of enzyme—substrate complexes
(Faulon et al., 2008). We present here a molecular structure—biased
search algorithm based on SMARTS—type (Daylight Theory Manual,

Pathway Distance

Fig. 1. The Tanimoto coefficient moves towards 1 as the pathway distance be-
tween a ‘product' node and an ‘intermediate' approaches 0, but can have de-
viations from this trend in cases where large cofactor modifications are
carried out. The pathways shown are tryptophan synthesis (Trp), the MEP
pathway, glycolysis (EMF), uridinyl synthesis (UMP), a synthetic 1,4-butane-
diol pathway (BDO) (Yim et al., 2011), and caffeine synthesis (Caf). Pathway
distance is defined as the number of transformations linking two metabolites.
Tanimoto coefficient shows a general increasing trend on average as a func-
tion of pathway distance (dashed line)

2011) (Supplementary Fig. S1) fingerprint similarity measured using
the Tanimoto coefficient (Rogers and Tanimoto, 1960) (r) to guide
the network search, making the use of traditional pathway search
algorithms a more tractable undertaking. Similar successful
approaches have been taken to enable rapid searching of extant
metabolic networks such as KEGG for links to known pathway
mapping (Hattori et al., 2010) and validation of biochemical reac—
tions in large databases (Felix and Valiente, 2007). Our approach
applies the chemical similarity comparison on—the—ﬂy to foster effi—
cient convergence on a target molecule and subsequent annotation
of the edges in the resultant network.

In a metabolic network, nearby metabolites are more chemically
similar than distant metabolites (Fig. 1). Therefore, proceeding to—
wards a particular product via a metabolic pathway should see the
intermediates generally becoming more similar to the final product.
We have used this property of increasing chemical similarity in
metabolic pathways to bias our search through metabolic networks.
This algorithm of searching for increased chemical similarity cannot
only be used for reaction/metabolite bipartite networks, but also can
be utilized to search for promiscuous substrates an enzyme may act
on within a metabolic network.

An additional improvement to pathway searching utilizes the
searching algorithm developed by Byers and Waterman (1984) to
expedite pathway searching by ensuring that only pathways that
have the capability of meeting certain additional criteria are
explored (Fig. 2). For the work in this article, we utilize the criteria
of path length with the assumption that short paths are, in general,
easier to engineer into a cell. However, this technique is capable of
expediting pathway searching by utilizing additional criteria such as
the number of reactions that are novel to an organism, the thermo—
dynamic favorability of a pathway, or the number of energy carriers
expended by the pathway. To our knowledge, this is the first use of
this technique to search for pathways in putative metabolic
networks.

Fig. 2. The starting and target compound for the pathway search are shown
by a white and a node marked with an  respectively. In this example, the
maximum path length allowed is five. First, a breadth-first search is run to
determine the distance of each node from the starting node (A). The black
arrows indicate a shortest path to each node. Next, all of the edges are
reversed and a breadth-first search is run again to determine the distance of
each node from the target node (B). The sum of these two distances is calcu-
lated. If this sum is greater than five for any node, then that node and all its
associated edges are removed (C). Finally, a depth-first search is run on the
reduced network to find all pathways of length five or less (D). In this exam-
ple, four such pathways exist and are illustrated by black arrows

Using these methods, we present a fast and efficient strategy for
exploring metabolic networks generated by making use of known
biological transformations to suggest alternative pathways based on
the expansion of known enzymatic activities. As a test case, we
apply the tools developed to a problem that was previously impracti—
cal using the Biochemical Network Integrated Computational
Explorer (BNICE) (Hatzimanikatis et al., 2005; Henry et al., 2010a;
Li et al., 2004), a program that creates a metabolic network by
simulating all combinations of possible biochemical reactions on a
starting compound. Searching this large network is intractable with
previous graph search approaches. We show that our new algo—
rithms overcome these limitations by predicting a novel pathway
linking methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) and isopentenyl pyro—
phosphate (IPP). The results should enable the analysis of metabolic
networks that are orders of magnitude larger than current networks.
Applying these tools will allow for the development of many novel
synthetic routes to previously unattainable chemicals.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Data sources and fingerprints

In order to analyze the thermodynamics and chemical similarity for
native pathways, a metabolic model—iAF1260—was downloaded
from the ModelSEED project (Henry et al., 2010b), and processed
with the NetworkX (Hagberg et al., 2008) Python. Chemical
similarity indexing was carried out with the ‘FP4’ fingerprint type
available from the OpenBabel (O’Boyle et al., 2008, 2011) chemin—
formatics package. The chemical fingerprints are 1D binary arrays
where each position corresponds to a different substructure query.
The value in each position is ‘1’ if the substructure corresponding to

that position is present in the molecule being fingerprinted and is ‘0’
otherwise. Fingerprint pairs are scored according to Equation (1),
where [I and B represent two molecular fingerprints being
compared.

Gibbs’ free energy of formation (AGf) values was predicted using
group contribution theory (Jankowski et al., 2008; Mavrovouniotis,
1990, 1991) and was used to calculate Gibbs’ free energy of reaction
(AGr) values. The thermodynamics calculations were made in
BNICE and were set to correct for coupled reactions and pH (Henry
et al., 2006, 2007) and oxygenase activity (VanBriesen, 2001).
Searches for alternative pathways through metabolic networks after
application of SimIndex (SI) were made using a depth first search.

2.2 SimIndex

Similarity indexing was used to reduce the number of nodes
searched in a metabolic network by biasing the search toward nodes
representing chemically similar molecules. SI takes a starting com—
pound and target compound as inputs. During the network search,
all nodes (molecules) that are the daughters of a particular node
starting node X are compared with the target molecule via 1 (rdt).
The parent node X is also compared with the target compound (1”).
dt > Tpt
are not searched because they represent graph steps that decrease in

Daughter nodes that fail to meet the acceptance criterion 1

chemical similarity to the target molecule. In subsequent rounds of
the search, where the daughter nodes are more than one step
removed from X and hence may have disparate parents, the I"t used
for the comparison is given by the average I"t as shown Equation (2),
where i is the number of steps removed from X and n; is the number
of nodes i steps removed from X.
1 11;

‘17P[ :  i:1 17]“ (2)
In benchmarking this method, it was often necessary to relax the
rejection criterion by a tolerance k such that a node is not searched
if rd‘ > k’irpt in order that our method could successfully recapitu—
late native pathways. A k-value of 0 forces all nodes to be searched,
making it equivalent to a breadth—first search. SI runs were per—
formed on eight—processor high—memory nodes with 64 GB of RAM,
and 2.4 GHz Intel Xeon E5 620 processors.

2.3 Byers—Waterman pathway searching
Searches for alternative pathways through metabolic networks gen—
erated using SI were made using a modified version of the algorithm
proposed by Byers and Waterman (1984) for finding all near—
optimum pathways in a weighted network. Brieﬂy, this algorithm
works as follows. First, the shortest path is found between each
node in the network and the target node. The length of this path ﬁn)
is saved as a property of each node n. A standard depth—first search
algorithm is then run with the following modification. Before the al—
gorithm traverses any edge it first calculates the sum of the weights
of the edges currently in the path, the weight of the edge being tra—
versed, and ﬂm) where m is the destination node of the edge. If this
value is greater than some user specified maximum cost, the edge is
not traversed. This allows for the efficient discovery of all pathways
near the optimum pathway where nearness is defined by the user.
For all the pathway searches performed in this work the criteria
utilized to define optimality was the path length. Utilization of this
criterion simplified the Byers—Waterman searching algorithm since

each edge cost is identically one. This allowed for the implementa—
tion of the algorithm in the following manner. First, a breadth—first
search was run from the starting compound and the distance of each
node in the network from that node, as, was recorded. Next, a simi—
lar process was performed to determine the distance from each node
in the network to the target compound for the pathway, at. Next,
the following inequality was tested for each node i in the network.

¢+¢>N m

Here, N is the maximum allowable length of the pathways. Any
node for which this inequality is true is removed from the network
because it is not on any path of length less than or equal to N.
Finally, a depth—first search is performed to find all the pathways on
this reduced network. This significantly increases the speed of path—
way discovery by reducing the nodes which must be explored by the
depth—first search.

2.4 SimZyme
SimZyme proposes putative edges between enzymes and metabolites
based on the similarity of a given metabolite to other metabolites
the enzymes is known to act upon. For SimZyme, we query the
BRENDA enzyme database (Scheer et al., 2011), which lists all
documented substrate—product pairs for each fully elucidated en—
zyme as our training data. Once a pathway through a putative meta—
bolic network is selected, all that is known about a given step in the
pathway is a generalization of the chemistry performed by several
different enzymes (Henry, 2007) and bears what is most often the
first three digits of the Enzyme Commission (EC) designation of the
enzymes used to create the chemical operator. Based on this informa—
tion, it is necessary to select real enzymes that might be able to per—
form the appropriate chemistry on a given metabolite in the pathway.
To accomplish this, a query metabolite is compared against all sub—
strates listed in the BRENDA database for any EC numbers mapped
to a particular biochemical transformation. For SimZyme, the map—
ping procedure compared reactions to be mapped to those produced
by generalized transformations in the BNICE software (Henry, 2007).
Known specific reactions reproduced by each generalized transform—
ation are mapped to those generalized transformations. The output
provided ranks enzymes for their potential to act upon the query me—
tabolite by the similarity of the enzymes’ known substrates to the
query metabolite. We selected enzymes whose substrates most closely
resembled our pathway intermediates to propose specific enzymes to
use, relying on promiscuous enzyme activity to catalyze the reaction.
Benchmarking SimZyme was done using a leave—one—out cross
validation. The sampling process proceeds by selecting a random
compound associated with the queried biochemical transformation
100 times. The compounds selected were in SMILES form converted
from the names in the database—compounds selected whose struc—
tures could not assigned canonical SMILES were omitted from the
analysis. A naive enzyme—substrate database is constructed by
removing all instances of the chosen compounds one at a time from
the full database. The naive database is then queried as described
above, with the deleted compound as the query in each iteration, the
results were compiled and analyzed.

3 Results

3.1 Benchmarking SI

A Python—based script was developed to carry out the SI algorithm
which biases a network search by prioritizing nodes that are more
similar to the product as described in Section 2 (Fig. 3). We

Fig. 3. SI modulates the number of compounds that are allowed to proceed to
the next generation. In a given generation, the average Tanimoto coefficient
of the parent molecules with the target is calculated. The Tanimoto coefficient
of each daughter compound with the target is also calculated. The progeny of
daughter compounds with a lower similarity with respect to the target com-
pound than the parent compounds are not searched

 

investigated two aspects of SI: its ability to find a target compound
of interest, as well as its ability to complete this task while searching
fewer nodes within a putative metabolic network than a breadth—
first search. The NetGen module of the biochemical network explor—
ation software BNICE (Hatzimanikatis et al., 2005) was used to
generate putative metabolic networks.

We first tested the performance of SI in identifying native meta—
bolic pathways in searching of putative metabolic networks, namely
the mevalonate (MVA) pathway from R—MVA to IPP and the pen—
tose phosphate pathway from B—D—glucose—6—phosphate (G6P) to
D—arabino—3—hexulose—6—phosphate (A6P). Values of the chemical
similarity bias parameter [2 were varied from 0.8 (weak bias for
chemical similarity to 1.0 (strong bias, see ‘Materials and methods’)
for runs on both networks to determine if the chemical similarity
bias would find the native pathways to the target compound. Values
of [2 below 0.8 yielded networks with a number of compounds
nearly equal to that of a NetGen run without SI and thus were not
used for benchmarking. Across all tested tolerances, the target com—
pounds were found. Furthermore, pathways linking MVA and IPP
(three steps) and G6P and A6P (four steps) were composed of com—
pounds found in the native MVA pathway and pentose phosphate
pathway, respectively.

The MVA pathway search with SI searched 1.5— to 5—fold fewer
compounds between [2 : 0.8 and k : 1.0 compared with the
breadth—first style NetGen search (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Average values of r for the set of all compounds equidistant from
start compound increased as the distance from the start compound
increased (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The decrease in compounds
searched was accompanied by a 3— to 27—fold decrease in computa—
tional time taken to generate the putative sub—network over the
same range of chemical similarity biases (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Similarly, the number of compounds searched in the putative net—
work surrounding G6P drastically decreased by 16— to 1 17—fold over
the range of tolerances (Fig. 4A). As with the MVA to IPP search,
the average value of r for all compounds an equal distance from the
start compound showed a general increasing trend as the distance
from the start compound increased (Fig. 4B). The computational
time for searching the network around G6P decreased 10— to
10 000—fold over the tolerance range (Fig. 4C).

3.2 Benchmarking Byers—Waterman pathway search

SI shows impressive efficiency at reducing the size of the generated—
subnetvvork. However, the use of additional requirements on the
pathways can even further reduce the number of nodes that must be
explored. To illustrate this, we found all pathways from G6P to A6P
in the k : 0.8 network with lengths of three, four and five. Utilizing
the Byers—Waterman search algorithm (BWPS), the number of nodes

explored during the pathway search was reduced compared with the
depth—first search by two to three orders of magnitude. The compu—
tational time gains begin to become evident in searches for pathways
of length four, with a 5—fold time improvement. Searches for paths
of length five are completed with a 10—fold reduction in

orders of magnitude with varying tolerance (k) with SI (A). The average

that observed in the three-generation run (B). Computational time decreases

computational time. This decrease in number of nodes visited did
not, however, reduce the number of pathways found; in both the
depth—first search and BWPS search, the same number of pathways
was found for each specified pathway length. SI shows impressive ef—
ficiency at reducing the size of the generated—subnetwork. However,
the use of additional requirements on the pathways can even further
reduce the number of nodes that must be explored. To illustrate this,
we found all pathways from G6P to A6P in the k : 0.8 network
with lengths of three, four and five. Utilizing the BWPS, the number
of nodes explored during the pathway search was reduced compared
with the depth—first search by two to three orders of magnitude. The
computational time gains begin to become evident in searches for
pathways of length four, with a 5—fold time improvement. Searches
for paths of length five are completed with a 10—fold reduction in
computational time.

This decrease in number of nodes visited did not, however,
reduce the number of pathways found; in both the depth—first search
and BWPS search, the same number of pathways was found for each

3.3 Benchmarking SimZyme

To validate SimZyme, which predicts promiscuous reactions, we
examine the accuracy with which it could correctly assign enzymes
that will act on a substrate given a training set of substrates of en—
zymes with a similar reaction type. The leave—one—out validation
using the BRENDA enzyme promiscuity database (Scheer et al.,
2011) is based solely on the chemical similarity to other substrates
on which the member enzymes show activity. The basis for our
benchmarking is that the sampling of compounds that are substrates
of enzymes in a given class is a Bernoulli process where success is
defined as finding the first correct enzymes within the top it best—
scoring enzymes that catalyze chemically similar substrates as scored
by r. The proportion of successful trials in a Bernoulli process
follows a beta distribution, which is bounded on the interval (0, 1);
90 and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were constructed around
the mean proportion assuming this distribution as the probability
density function (Fig. 5). We selected four types of biological trans—
formations on which to test SimZyme. SimZyme succeeded in scor—
ing the correct enzyme in the top three 90.1% of the time on
average across the four classes tested; the correct enzyme received
the highest score 74% of the time.

3.4 Case study: A de novo MEP pathway

In order to demonstrate the utility of both the improved pathway
searching and SimZyme in proposing novel pathways extant in pu—
tative metabolic networks, we endeavored to elucidate a de novo
pathway—which we define as proceeding through either partially or
entirely through novel metabolites—linking MEP with IPP. This
pathway is of particular interest for metabolic engineering as it has a
better theoretical yield than the commonly used MVA pathway, but
it has a number of problematic features (Ajikumar et al., 2010;
Carlsen et al., 2013). This is chieﬂy due to the inefficiency of the
iron—sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery required to assemble
the active forms of the proteins IspG (Lee et al., 2010) and IspH
(Grawert et al., 2004), two key enzymes in the native bacterial path—
way (Fig. 6). Another feature of the pathway that proves problem—
atic in bacteria is the limitation of intermediate efﬂux, primarily
methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate, which is the product of the reac—
tion catalyzed by the enzyme IspF (Zhou et al., 2012), whose AGr is
an unfavorable +26 kcal/mol.

We first attempted to circumvent the terminal step in the path—
way catalyzed by the ISC—containing enzyme IspH; we explored
putative metabolic networks using both (E)—4—hydroxy—3—methyl—
but—2—enyl pyrophosphate and its singly phosphorylated analog,
shown in Figure 6 as species 3. We found a set of four transform—
ations with suitable thermodynamics linking species 3 with IPP in
the putative network searched with SI with k : 0.85. Having found
a potential latter half of a de novo pathway for IPP production, we
then searched the putative metabolic network surrounding the me—
tabolite MEP for potential synthetic routes to species 3. SI did not
include species 3 in its truncated putative network of depth four
around MEP, but did yield a species 2 that can potentially reach 3
by a reaction not included in the set of biochemical transformations
used in generating the putative network. The failure to directly find
a connection was because the appropriate biochemistry had not
been encoded in the underlying software. Taken together, these pu—
tative metabolites form a seven—step pathway (Fig. 6) linking MEP
and IPP via a vastly superior thermodynamic landscape (Fig. 7).

Fig. 7. The thermodynamic landscape of the original MEP pathway beginning
from MEP has unfavorable thermodynamics at IspF (dashed line). The pro-
posed alternative begins at MEP and proceeds with improved thermo-
dynamics to IPP (solid line). The thermodynamics calculations take into
account coupled reactions involving cofactors, such as ATP hydrolysis

We then used SimZyme to assist in assigning specific enzymes,
making certain that the ones chosen were not dependent on ISCs for
activity. We selected high—ranking results whose chemistry matched
the transformations given in the putative networks (Table 1). The
chemistry required to link intermediates 2 and 3 is of the type per—
formed by the 4.2.1 class of enzymes, and so we determined that
these two pathways could potentially be linked via promiscuous ac—
tivity of enzymes that were determined by SimZyme. Additionally,
the final transformation in the putative network that connects spe—
cies 6 with IPP can be carried out with the native activity of isopen—
tenyl phosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.26). Because of SI, BWPS and
SimZyme, we are now able to fully propose metabolic pathways for
long and complicated chemistry.

4 Discussion

As the focus of metabolic engineering shifts to more exotic second—
ary metabolites, the exploration of metabolic networks is a vital first
step in the design of novel biosynthetic pathways in common chassis
organisms. It is highly useful to elucidate routes connecting two
nodes in organism networks, metaorganism networks and putative
networks of all possible biochemical transformations via in silico
simulations (Ajikumar et al., 2010; Choi and Lee, 2013; Henry
et al., 2010b; Li et al., 2004; Yim et al., 2011). As either type of
network has the potential to be large and highly—connected—
particularly if edges are added to account for the effects of enzyme
promiscuity—efficient searching of the available pathways through
the network is key for enumerating all possible routes linking two
nodes in the network.

In linear native pathways, each successive compound in a given
pathway has, in general, a greater similarity to the ‘target’ than the
previous compound in line. We propose that this constraint is inte—
gral to reducing putative pathways existing in a given metabolic net—
work, and may mirror the natural biological imperative to keep

metabolic pathways to the fewest possible steps. Observed excep—
tions to this trend occur when relatively small molecules are acti—
vated with the attachment of a large cofactor—such as coenzyme A,
acyl carrier protein, or cytidine—that can cause the similarity of an
intermediate to sharply decrease. Representing these modifications
as single atoms or single features in a fingerprinting routine has the
potential to rectify this perceived downturn in chemical similarity
along a metabolic pathway. In the event of pathways involving a
condensation, it is also possible to observe exceptions to this trend.

The breadth—first style illumination of these large putative net—
works, achieved through iterative applications of a pre—defined set
of reaction rules to a seed compound and its progeny, stands to
benefit from similarity—based improvements to allow deeper explor—
ation into chemical space. This could also be expanded to include
non—biological chemical networks that are similarly large and would
benefit from improved network navigation algorithms. This real—
time generation of putative networks is necessary since, unlike
metabolomics databases based on individual organisms, databases
of putative networks are uncommon and existing ones tend to be
focused on pharmaceutical targets in humans (Menikarachchi et al.,
2013; Peach et al., 2012). With SI, the nodes eligible for addition to
a pathway through a network at each step are reduced to those
nodes which are more similar (within a tolerance) to the target com—
pound than the previous cohort of nodes. The on—the—fly application
of the similarity search as the nodes in the network are illuminated
differentiates SI from existing approaches previously used to valid—
ate proposed reactions in biochemical databases (Felix and Valiente,
2007).

We attempt to select enzymes that will comprise the novel path—
ways discovered using similarity—based methods in the SimZyme
utility. The problem of identifying enzymes with high promiscuity
and determining if they will act on intermediates in novel pathways
has been previously addressed using amino acid sequence data
(Nath and Atkins, 2008) or 3D protein structure (Wu et al., 2011),
and others limit the scope of their promiscuity search to relatively
small reaction libraries (Cho et al., 2010). Similarity—based methods
have the advantage of being relatively quick for comparing a pro—
posed substrate against known substrates cataloged in a large data—
base. The small amount of information required for SimZyme
compared with other methods makes it an attractive choice for
broad application. Compared with more intensive methods of

determining enzyme promiscuity, a similarity—based approach
coupled with the enzyme—substrate data from a large database such
as BRENDA (Scheer et al., 2011) is suitable for rapid in silico anno—
tation of novel biosynthetic pathways to value—added compounds
within biochemical networks as demonstrated by the de novo MEP
pathway. BRENDA offers a larger amount of substrates for com—
parison to a proposed metabolite, as it enumerates observed experi—
mental interactions in addition to consensus substrates as found in
SIMCOMP/SUBCOMP searches (Hattori et al., 2010) and KEGG—
based approaches(Cho et al., 2010). Although the BRENDA web
service does support a substructure search, SimZyme performs a dif—
ferent, similarity—based substrate search that allows more results,
which could reveal novel substrate—enzyme complex possibilities, ex—
panding the scope of known enzyme promiscuity.

In order to demonstrate the utility of chemical similarity—based
methods for navigating metabolic networks, we attempted a re—
design of an existing metabolic pathway: the MEP pathway in
E.coli. The MEP pathway consists of seven reactions, beginning
with condensation of glyceraldehyde—3—phosphate with pyruvate,
and culminating in the formation of the isoprenoid precursor IPP.
Interest in introducing this pathway into yeast is due to its improved
stoichiometry over the eukaryotic IPP—producing MVA pathway and
the wealth of diverse product that can be produced from down—
stream reactions on IPP (Carlsen et al., 2013). However, two of the
pathway enzymes contain ISCs that cannot be efficiently loaded into
the recombinant enzymes (Carlsen et al., 2013; Grawert et al., 2004;
Lee et al., 2010) and it is possible that oxidative damage to ISCs in
E.coli may also complicate production (Partow et al., 2012). The re—
designed pathway replaced the five steps linking the intermediate
MEP with IPP with seven enzymatic steps that do not rely on ISC
proteins. A putative network expanding radially from species 3 in
the novel pathway contains on the order of 104 nodes; applying SI
reduces that figure to on the order of 102 nodes, and application of
BWPS reduces that figure even further by another order of magni—
tude, drastically increasing the speed of a depth—first search for a
pathway linking 3 with IPP, while at the same time allowing for a
diverse population of compounds to be considered.

SimZyme subsequently identifies candidate enzymes to carry
out the reactions proposed in the novel metabolic pathway. As
SimZyme ranks enzymes purely based on substrate similarity, the
possibility exists that an enzyme performing a different type of reac—
tion on the intermediate in the proposed pathway will be proposed.
Algorithmically, this is difficult to account for because the ensemble
of BRENDA entries searched is tied to the biotransformations used
by the putative network—generating software, but errors are rare in
the highest—scoring results and can easily be identified by inspection
when they occur. In the case of the novel MEP pathway, SimZyme
provided at least one candidate enzyme in the top three results with
a reaction outcome congruent with the reaction predicted in the
putative network.

Similarity based search tools as developed here are relatively
fast, easily implementable methods to expedite the design of a novel
metabolic pathways. In this article, we demonstrate the utility of a
fingerprint similarity—based method for efficiently navigating a puta—
tive network from a starting compound to a product of interest;
however, the concept of a similarity based, modified best—first search
is easily extensible to native metabolic networks with orders of mag—
nitude fewer nodes. Tools for creating putative networks can gener—
ate enormous amounts of data that must be sifted through in order
to find pathways from a designated starting compound to a target of
interest. Existing depth—first search algorithms that select branches
at random are adequate for most current native metabolic networks

and small meta—networks, but as the capability to generate larger pu—
tative networks grows, such algorithms will become inefficient.
Increased efficiency over our method may be possible using a 3D fin—
gerprint approach, since the 2D fingerprints used for this study en—
code the functional groups found via SMARTS search in a molecule
and the implicit configuration within the groups, but does not cap—
ture the 3D geometry and connectivity of the molecule or the spatial
relationships among the several functional groups. Future imple—
mentations of the methods described herein may show improved
efficacy if based on a more complex 3D fingerprint similarity ap—
proach that can more precisely describe 3D characteristics, which
are important in determining if a molecule is shaped similarly
enough to known substrates of a given enzyme to be able to fit into
the corresponding enzyme’s active site.

A systematic workﬂow for efficient assembly of novel pathways
in silico is an important approach for simplifying transition from
computer to bench—top in modern metabolic engineering efforts.
The increasingly large size of known metabolic networks has the
benefit of increasing the palette of biochemical transformations that
can be considered for inclusion in de novo biosynthetic pathways.
On the other hand, this presents a challenge that merits a scalable
and rapid solution. With the development of similarity—based meth—
ods to improve both the search for potentially useful metabolic path—
ways and the annotation of putative novel edges between nodes
within large networks, the implementation of experiments to con—
firm the practicality of in silico predictions can be hastened.

Abstract

Summary: Isotope tracer experiments are an invaluable technique to analyze and study the metab—
olism of biological systems. However, isotope labeling experiments are often affected by naturally
abundant isotopes especially in cases where mass spectrometric methods make use of derivatiza—
tion. The correction of these additive interferences—in particular for complex isotopic systems—is
numerically challenging and still an emerging field of research. When positional information is
generated via collision—induced dissociation, even more complex calculations for isotopic interfer—
ence correction are necessary. So far, no freely available tools can handle tandem mass spectrom—
etry data. We present isotope correction toolbox, a program that corrects tandem mass isotopomer
data from tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Isotope correction toolbox is written in the
multi—platform programming language Perl and, therefore, can be used on all commonly available
computer platforms.

1 Introduction

Isotope labeling experiments play a crucial role in exploring, study-
ing and understanding metabolic pathways in biological systems.
However, the obtained isotopolog and tandem mass isotopomer sig-
nals are biased by natural abundant isotopes of the native molecules
and of atoms introduced via derivatization (Antoniewicz, 2013).
Consequently, the natural abundance results in a distortion of the
experimental data. The correction of mass spectrometry data is still
an emerging field of research (Carreer et 31., 2013; Choi et 31., 2013;
Moseley, 2010; Rantanen et 31., 2002; van Winden et 31., 2002;
Wittman and Heinzle, 1999), as it is non-trivial and numerically
challenging, in particular, if a large number of isotopes are con-
sidered during the correction procedure. There exist several software
tools which are able to compute the contribution of intensities from
the natural abundant isotopes on the measured intensities and hence

are capable to correct the measured data. Pymzc (Carreer et (11.,
2013) (http://files.cesb.ul<y.edu/software/PYNAC/) is a correction
software written in the programming language Python. Pymzc bene-
fits from the multi-platform capabilities of Python is highly flexible
by using text files for configuration and setup and can account for
any number of isotopes. However, it is not able to correct data from
tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Another prominent avail-
able program is IsoCor (Millard et (11., 2012) (http://metasys.insa
toulouse.fr/software/isocor/). IsoCor is also implemented in Python
and is a fast and excellent tool to correct mass spectrometry data. It
supports the correction of the natural abundance of the tracer at un-
labeled positions and allows to take into account the isotopic purity
of the labeling source. Furthermore, in IsoCor, any isotope and not
only 13C can be used as tracer. Though IsoCor is also not able to
deal with tandem mass isotopomer data. In this application note, we

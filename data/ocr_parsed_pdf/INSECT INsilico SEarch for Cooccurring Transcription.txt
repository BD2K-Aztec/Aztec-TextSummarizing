ABSTRACT

Motivation: Transcriptional regulation occurs through the concerted
actions of multiple transcription factors (T Fs) that bind cooperatively
to cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) of genes. These CRMs usually con-
tain a variable number of transcription factor-binding sites (T FBSs)
involved in related cellular and physiological processes. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) has been ef-
fective in detecting TFBSs and nucleosome location to identify potential
CRMs in genome-wide studies. Although several attempts were previ-
ously reported to predict the potential binding of TFs at TFBSs within
CRMs by comparing different ChIP-seq data, these have been ham-
pered by excessive background, usually emerging as a consequence of
experimental conditions. To understand these complex regulatory cir-
cu its, it would be helpful to have reliable and updated user-friendly tools
to assist in the identification of TFBSs and CRMs for gene(s) of interest.
Results: Here we present INSECT (IN-silico SEarch for Co-occurring
Transcription factors), a novel web server for identifying potential
TFBSs and CRMs in gene sequences. By combining several strategies,
INSECT provides flexible analysis of multiple co-occurring TFBSs, by
applying differing search schemes and restriction parameters.

1 INTRODUCTION

Regulation of transcription occurs through the concerted actions
of multiple TFs that bind to cis—regulatory modules (CRMs)
(Arnone and Davidson, 1997; Kirchhamer et al., 1996).
Experimental techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation
followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) have provided valuable insight
into the mechanisms governing gene regulation. However, these
techniques produce large amounts of data of variable quality, in-
herent to the complex experimental conditions used (Park, 2009).
The inconvenience, together with high data analysis costs, makes

this strategy unappealing without speciﬁc information to help
reduce the dataset before performing experiments.

The availability of more efﬁcient sequencing techniques,
together with the growing number of genomes deposited on
public databases, provides an ideal scenario for development of
bioinformatics tools facilitating design of future experiments in
this ﬁeld. Several tools have been recently developed to search
and characterize the transcription factor-binding sites (TFBSs) of
CRMs by dissecting relationships among them (Van Loo and
Marynen, 2009). Currently available TFBSs search tools can
be grouped into two major approaches: (i) Motif discovery:
TFBSs are inferred by analyzing a group of sequences that are
considered to be under the regulation of a particular transcrip-
tion factor (TF) and (ii) Motif search: to determine the location
where a TF is more likely to bind by searching its corresponding
TFBS over sequence datasets.

The constant progress in experimental technologies and the
establishment and execution of initiatives such as the
ENCODE project (Raney et al., 2011) have helped to character-
ize large sets of TFBSs. Thus, a considerable amount of position
weight matrices (PWMs, i.e. elements that represent a group
of sequences that are recognized by a speciﬁc TF) has been
deposited on databases such as TRANSFAC (Matys et al.,
2006), JASPAR (Bryne et al., 2008) and UniPROBE
(Newburger and Bulyk, 2009). Such matrices derived from align-
ment and processing of target sequences can be used to search
potential TFBSs over genomes and sequences as well as to
establish potential sites of gene regulation. An important limita-
tion of this methodology is its high false-positive rate (FPR).
According to the futility theorem (Wasserman and Sandelin,
2004), the presence of non-functional binding sites for a given
TF can be three orders of magnitude higher compared with the
actual number of functional sites of genomes (Tronche et al.,
1997). FPR reduction without compromising the sensitivity of
the method is challenging, and several strategies have been
designed to tackle this problem. However, many of these tools
are organism speciﬁc (i-cisTarget, DiRE), discontinued in their
maintenance (MSCAN, cis—analyst), outdated (ModuleMiner,
TFBScluster, PReMod) or lack ﬂexibility and are difﬁcult to
use by non-computational scientists (as reviewed by Van Loo
and Marynen, 2009). Importantly, most of these tools do not
allow implementation of rules regarding the relationships
between the individual TFBSs of a particular CRM (Frith
et al., 2003). This caveat represents a significant limitation
during CRM screening. Nevertheless, most of these tools have

proven quite valuable to the scientiﬁc community, assisting in the
characterization and study of CRMs.

Here we present INSECT (IN-silico SEarch for Co-occurring
Transcription factors), a novel motif search web tool for identiﬁ-
cation of potential TFBSs and CRMs. By combining different
strategies, INSECT allows for complete and ﬂexible analysis of
multiple co-occurring TFBSs. We have compared INSECT per-
formance with other tools analyzing experimental data related to
the regulation of genes by Sox2 and Oct-4 TFs in embryonic stem
cells (ESCs). The regulatory networks of mouse and human ESC
properties have been studied extensively (Boyer et al., 2005;
Rodda et al., 2005). Many target genes of the Sox2 and Oct-4
TFs have been identiﬁed using genome-wide ChIP followed by
DNA microarray analysis (Boyer et al., 2005; Loh et al., 2006).
These TFs (in addition to an additional TF, Nanog) appear to act
in concert to regulate a limited repertoire of target genes, tightly
regulating the ESCs’ pluripotent state.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Experimental datasets

To assess INSECT performance, we selected two experimental datasets.

Rodda dataset. The exact sequences and positions that are bound by
Sox2 and Oct-4 in six genes were previously experimentally reported
(Table 1; Rodda et al., 2005). The regions from —5 to +5 kb relative to
the transcription start site (TSS) were scanned for each gene.

Boyer dataset. Genome-wide ChIP assay was previously performed and
reported by Boyer et a]. (2005). We used a subset of genes reported by Sun
et a]. (2009) that bind Sox2 and Oct-4 cooperatively in their proximal
promoter region (from —1 kb to the TSS) from which, after mapping to
Ensembl Gene IDs, we obtained 79 genes (Supplementary Table S4).

2.2 Sox2 and Oct-4 PWMs used for CRM searches

The INSECT module to create PWMs was used to make two PWMs
from the Sox2 and Oct-4 binding sequences of the Rodda dataset. In
addition, the PWM for Poqul (Oct-4, MA0142.1), publicly available
from JASPAR, was also used.

2.3 Benchmarking to other computational approaches

INSECT performance was compared with three tools with comparable
search features: CPModule (Sun et al., 2012), Cluster Buster (Frith et al.,
2003) and MotifViz (Fu et al., 2004). The performance was measured
using the following parameters Equations (173):

Speczﬁcz y FP + TN ( )
TP
. it. it = — 2
Semi lvt y TP + FN ( )

MCC = * * (3)

\/(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)

where MCC is the Mathews Correlation Coefﬁcient, TP are the true
positives, TN are the true negatives, FP are the false positives and FN
are the false negatives.

2.4 PWM construction and formats

INSECT uses the TFBS Perl module (Lenhard and Wasserman, 2002) to
implement the PWMs creation from a multiple sequence alignment.
Although TFBS allows for the construction of different types of scoring
matrices (ICM, PFM and PWM), we chose the TFBS PWM building
module. Scoring matrices in PFM and PWM format can also be

uploaded. Other modules in TFBS Perl module were also used to perform
PWM searches.

2.5 PWM scoring

The score assigned by a PWM m to a substring S = (.S‘J')j’:1 is deﬁned as
1 my”, where j represents position in the substring, s) is the symbol at
position j in the substring and mm]- is the score in row or and column j of
the matrix. PWM scores are calculated as the sum of position-speciﬁc
scores for each symbol in a given substring. We assume a direct association
between the DNA sequence variability in the binding sites and the binding
affinity (or activity) for the particular protein that recognizes these sites
(Berg and von Hippel, 1987; Stormo and Fields, 1998). In this context, if
enough number of sequences were used to build the PWM, higher TF
binding afﬁnities would be indicated by higher PWM scores, being the
maximum matrix score (MMSc), MM Sc 2 1 max(mj). Substrings will
have PWM scores no greater than its MMSc. The score of every substring
is divided by the MMSc to normalize the TF affinities and provide a score
that is comparable among different factors without a length motif bias.

2.6 Score threshold setting

TFBSs search using a PWM requires deﬁning a score threshold to deter-
mine whether a sequence is defined as a potential TFBS or a false posi-
tive. A low-score threshold usually leads to the appearance of spurious
matches, making the prediction of potential TFBSs difﬁcult owing to a
high FPR. Therefore, users need to deﬁne and set an optimal threshold
for each search. For Sox2 and Oct-4, score threshold estimation refers to
the Results (section 4.1).

3 INSECT WEB SERVER

INSECT was designed as a user-friendly tool for non-computa-
tional scientists to perform motif search complex analysis. Here
we brieﬂy describe the main features in the INSECT web server.

3.1 Organisms and genes

Genes and putative regulatory regions from the genomes of 14
organisms can be deﬁned and sequences automatically retrieved
from the local copy of the latest Ensembl release (Flicek et al.,
2013). These genomes correspond to the most represented organ-
isms of the TF PWMs stored in JASPAR, TRANSFAC and
UniPROBE. Users need only provide a list of Ensembl gene
IDs or gene symbols and deﬁne the upstream and downstream
sequence limits relative to the TSS. Additionally, a multi-fasta
ﬁle containing up to 500 sequences can be uploaded to the server
to perform the search. In this case, the positions informed by

C.O.Rohr et al.

 

INSECT are numbered from 0 to L — 1, which corresponds to
the length of the sequences.

3.2 Phylogenetic footprinting

To reduce the FPR, INSECT can apply a phylogenetic f ootprint-
ing search through analysis of a conservation window between
orthologous genes. Orthologous sequences are automatically
retrieved from the local copy of the Ensembl genomes or
uploaded in a multi-fasta file. For every potential CRM identi-
ﬁed in a gene, the INSECT search algorithm requires the ortho-
logous gene sequence to have an equivalent CRM. A CRM is
considered equivalent by INSECT if positions relative to the TSS
are conserved within a range deﬁned by the user (default set to
1000 bp). Users are encouraged to apply this option carefully, as
it has been shown that 50% of regulatory elements are conserved
between human and mouse. It has also been postulated that most
of the conserved sites are those of high binding specificity
(Dermitzakis and Clark, 2002; Wray et al., 2003). Note that ﬁl-
tering out a speciﬁc site by applying phylogenetic footprinting
does not necessarily mean that it is a false positive; instead, it
increases the remaining sites’ chances of being true positives
owing to conservation. Therefore, phylogenetic footprinting is
an effective method of filtering out false positives, resulting in
more robust CRM identiﬁcation.

3.3 TFs and TFBSs

One major beneﬁt of INSECT resides in the ﬂexibility of deﬁning
search parameters. Users can search TFBSs by selecting PWMs
from the JASPAR (version 4.0), TRANSFAC (release 7.0) and
UniPROBE public databases. Owing to the low number of
matrices present in publicly (TRANSFAC 398, JASPAR 457
and UniPROBE 418) versus privately (TRANSFAC
Professional 1665) curated databases, INSECT allows the user
to build their own matrices from a multiple sequence alignment
as described in the TFBS Perl module (Lenhard and Wasserman,
2002), or to upload their own PWMs.

3.4 TFBSs search modes

Because CRMs are defined by a set of TFBSs and by speciﬁc
relationships among them, a correct CRM model deﬁnition and
build is essential. INSECT performs TFBSs search by two dif-
ferent methods.

Sliding window search. Target sequences are scanned using a
user-deﬁned window of fixed length (Fig. 1A). Analyzed subse-
quences must contain matches to all the entered TFs to report a
CRM. Additionally, users can deﬁne speciﬁc TFs as not neces-
sarily required to report a CRM by checking the Allow missing
option located in the TFs and TFBSs section of the selected TFs.

Master-driven search. A master TF is selected to drive the
search of co-occurring TFs, which are determined by maximum
spacing restrictions relative to the master (Fig. 1B). For both
search options, TFBSs can be searched in the direct, reverse
or both strand orientations. This represents a key feature of
INSECT, as TFs usually co-localize in very speciﬁc ways when
binding to DNA owing to proteiniprotein interactions and com-
plex spatial arrangements. The master-driven search mode is
more restrictive than the sliding window search mode, as it

search for a Master TF and two co-occurring TFs with differing max-
imum spacing restrictions

requires different factors to strictly satisfy imposed restrictions
with respect to a reference master TF. INSECT allows a max-
imum of ﬁve TFs, including the master.

3.5 INSECT results and Visualization

User-friendly interfaces to run the analysis (Supplementary
Fig. S1) and generate clear results (Supplementary Fig. S2) are
important issues for a bioinformatics web server. INSECT inte-
grates various features to achieve this goal. For genes in which
valid CRMs were identiﬁed by INSECT, Gene Ontology map-
ping (Ashburner et al., 2000), biological process, molecular func-
tions and cellular components can be Visualized, increasing the
confidence of the results. Moreover, diagrams corresponding
to CRMs along with the gene exon/intron structure for every
annotated transcript on Ensembl are drawn. INSECT dynamic-
ally generates tracks that can be submitted and automatically
opened with the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.
edu/, only available for Ensembl automatically retrieved
sequences) to analyze the detected CRMs, their relationship to
surrounding genomic regions and other UCSC Genome
Browser-annotated tracks. Finally, spreadsheets with the
TFBSs sequences and PWM scores as calculated in Lenhard
and Wasserman (2002) along with the Gene Ontology table,
CRMs with exons/introns structure diagrams and GFF ﬁles
(that can be submitted as UCSC Genome Browser tracks) can
be downloaded for each gene.

4 RESULTS

INSECT was tested by searching two experimental datasets for
TFBSs of Sox2 and Oct-4, two TFs involved in maintaining
pluripotency in ESCs. In the Rodda dataset analysis, CRMs
composed by Sox2 and Oct-4 binding sites were searched over
potential regulatory sequences corresponding to six genes that
were experimentally demonstrated to have these TFBS by Rodda
et al. (2005). We compared INSECT results and performance
with three existing motif search tools. We show that INSECT
outperformed the other tools in almost every analysis. In the
Boyer dataset analysis, Sox2 and Oct-4 co—occurrences were ana-
lyzed in gene sequences from a ChIP experiment reported by
Boyer et al. (2005).

4.1 Performance comparison using experimental data
(Rodda dataset)

To perform this analysis, we selected DNA regions from —5 to
+5 kb relative to the TSS of the six genes listed in Table 1. The
sensitivity, speciﬁcity and MCC as described in Equations (173)
in the Materials and Methods section were used to compare
tools’ performances in terms of TP, FP, TN and FN values.

Although there are two available matrices for Sox2 and Oct-4
in JASPAR (MA0143. 1, MA0142.1), both matrices have the Sox2
and Oct-4 motifs concatenated in a single matrix. Thus, the Oct-4
and Sox2 binding sites cannot be separated and a spacing param-
eter cannot be speciﬁed. Therefore, these matrices are incapable of
detecting the Sox2/Oct—4 CRM in the Fgf4 gene, where spacing
between the single motifs is >0 bp (see Table 1). As both matrices
are equivalent (Fig. 2), we selected the Oct-4 matrix (named
Pou5ﬂ in JASPAR) for performance comparison.

INSECT was used to create two separate PWMs for Sox2 and
Oct-4 using the sequences from sites reported in Table 1. The
sequence logos for the created PWM matrices show that the
motifs are consistent with the Pou5f1 matrix (Fig. 2).

Optimal threshold estimation. We evaluated a range of thresh-
olds to deﬁne the optimal score value for the Rodda dataset
analysis. Decreasing thresholds were applied from 100 to 75%
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S2), and the MCC value was
calculated for both Sox2 and Oct-4 motifs (Fig. 3). Maximum
MCC values were obtained from 86 to 89% score thresholds.

Comparative performance analysis. We selected CPModule,
MotifViz and ClusterBuster to compare their performances
against INSECT. These three tools share similar features with
INSECT, are updated and provide many options to enhance
CRMs searching. For this comparison, regulatory regions from
—5 to +5 kb relative to the TSS were automatically retrieved
from Ensembl using INSECT. The Sox2 and Oct-4 matrices
created with INSECT PWM construction functionality were
used for Sox2/Oct—4 CRMs search in all tools. Distance restric-
tions between the TFBS were set when possible.

INSECT Master Search mode was applied, with the following
search parameters. Sox2 was set as Master TF and Oct-4 as a
co-occurring (note that when <3 factors are analyzed, the factori
cofactor order is considered not relevant), with a maximum

spacing set at 3bp. Sox2 strand restriction was set to both
strand and same strand for Oct-4. A score threshold of 86%
was used in the analysis for both factors. CPModule was used
with eight additional randomly selected matrices from
TRANSFAC (Supplementary Table S3). The miner-proximity
parameter was set to 18bp, as it measures distance from the
beginning of the first motif to the end of the second. A raw
score of 7 was set, and mouse chromosome 19 used as a back-
ground sequence. MotifViz was used initially with default par-
ameters, but no sites were detected. Consequently, the P—Value
cutoff parameter was varied until all true positives, except for
Fbxol5, were detected (P = 0.18). Further P—Value increase did
not improve results (data not shown). The overall raw score
threshold parameter was set to 6.16 corresponding to the
lowest true-positive score (data not shown). ClusterBuster was
executed with default parameters and gap parameter set to 3 bp.
INSECT was the more robust tool related to both FF and FN
rates, and also with regard to MCC values. Results are summar-
ized in Table 2.

The results of the Rodda dataset analysis for the Pou5f1
JASPAR PWM are shown in Table 3. With the exception of
INSECT, the tools rely on P—Value analysis to perform motif
searches. The tools behavior is variable when matrices change,
in terms of TP and TN, reﬂecting the heterogeneity of the stra-
tegies, and the dependence on the PWM used. CPModule was
the most affected tool in terms of FF by the matrices replace-
ment, whereas ClusterBuster was the most affected in terms of
FN. Contrastingly, MotifViz improved its performance by dras-
tically lowering its FPR.

For the Pou5f1 PWM INSECT analysis, we used an 86% score
threshold in sliding window mode, without strand restriction.
CPModule was used using the same eight random matrices as
before, the raw score was set in 7 and the background sequence
was mouse chromosome 19. Cluster Buster was executed with the
default parameters. For MotifViz, the motif score threshold was
set in 7.62, and mouse chromosome 19 was used as background.

Note that by using the JASPAR matrix, a single motif search
instead of a CRM search was performed, as the two motifs for
Sox2 and Oct-4 were included in the same matrix. By applying this
approach, the master-driven search is not necessary any longer, as
the distance restriction is implicitly imposed in the matrix deﬁn-
ition itself (spacing 0 between Sox2 and Oct-4). Additionally, a
relative orientation between the two sub motifs (Sox2/Oct-4 is
allowed, whereas Oct-4/Sox2 is not) is implicitly applied.

4.2 Comparative analysis over ChIP data (Boyer dataset)

Matrices derived from the Rodda dataset and the threshold that
maximized the MCC for detecting the true positive over those
genes were initially used to perform the Sox2/Oct—4 CRM search
over 79 genes from the Boyer dataset. As with the Rodda dataset
comparison, the Pou5f1 matrix from JASPAR was also used.
The spacing between Sox2 and Oct-4 binding sites is known to
be >0 for genes like Fgf4, but the Pou5f1 matrix contains both
Sox2 and Oct-4 motifs with spacing 0 among them. We overcame
this co-occurrence limitation in the analysis by truncating the
Pou5f1 matrix into the two independent Sox2 and Oct-4 matrices
to perform the CRM search. This methodology is valid due to
independence among positions in a PWM, where the score cal-
culation at each position is independent from other positions.
These two matrices were used to search Sox2/Oct—4 binding
sites with a spacing distance up to 3 bp, the same as for
Rodda-derived matrices. Additionally, the relative orientation
between Sox2 and Oct-4 was also suppressed when splitting
Pou5f1 matrix into two independent matrices.

derived PWM matrices.)

The CRM searches of the Boyer dataset were performed using
INSECT on the proximal promoter regions corresponding to the
—1kb/TSS for each gene because the ChIP peaks were detected
experimentally within this regions. INSECT analysis of the
Boyer dataset, with Rodda-derived matrices and threshold,
found two genes only. For the case of the Pou5f1 matrix, 19
genes were hit. The number of hit genes increased to 31 when
the partitioned Pou5f1 matrices were used (Table 4). The differ-
ence in the values obtained is most probably due to the Pou5f1
matrix possibly allowing for higher variability in the represented
TFBS (Fig. 2), and higher variability of the TFBSs within the
regulatory regions of genes from Boyer versus Rodda datasets.
Because the true-positive binding sites are not known, MCC
values cannot be calculated to optimize the threshold parameter,
or to compare performance with other tools. Alternatively, the
number of genes that had at least one valid match (positive
genes), the total detected TFBS sites and the average number
of sites per gene were reported. A score threshold analysis
found that an 80% threshold improves the number of hit
genes without compromising the number of detected sites per
gene (data not shown). These results are summarized in Table 5.

4.3 Integration of INSECT results with other resources

In recent years, the number of databases containing experimental-
derived information has proliferated. Databases such as Gene
Ontology and the ENCODE project have provided researchers
with powerful resources to assist in hypothesis construction and

INSECT

 

genomic environment in the context of experimental information
present with many available tracks. This INSECT feature is im-
portant because the uncovering of false positives is one of the most
troublesome aspects of in silico CRMs search tools.

As a case study, we analyzed the INSECT results from the
Boyer dataset using the Rodda-derived matrices (Table 5) for the
H 0X B] gene (ENSG000001200094) and its corresponding
UCSC Genome Browser tracks (Fig. 4). We paid particular
attention to the ENCODE TF ChIP-seq data tracks. As shown
in Figure 4, histone marker tracks were added given more con-
ﬁdence to the CRM identiﬁcation.

INSECT permits several analyses to be performed within the
web server, making the analysis more focused and understand-
able in the context of a network. The main INSECT features are
summarized in Table 6.

5 DISCUSSION

INSECT is designed as a user-friendly interface to minimize tool
usage complexity along with integration of several methods that
aim to assist in Visualization and analysis of results. INSECT dy-
namically generates tracks that can be submitted and automatic-
ally opened within the UCSC Genome Browser to analyze the
detected CRMs and their relationship to surrounding genomic
regions. In this context, INSECT tracks can be analyzed along
with tracks, as the ChIP-Seq, DNase I Hypersensitivity, RNA-
Seq, DNA methylation information and many other features pro-
vided by the ENCODE project on the UCSC Genome Browser.
While INSECT only provides in silico estimation, the informa-
tion generated using this tool may be a valuable guide for experi-
mentation design and hypothesis construction. For example, it
was previously suggested that the relative orientation between
Sox2 and Oct-4 binding sites is critical, based on structural ana-
lysis of ternary complex among these two factors and DNA
(Remenyi et al., 2003). INSECT is the only solution among the
tools evaluated here that can apply the strand restriction and
restrict relative orientations between TFBSs within CRMs.

We have demonstrated how INSECT facilitates CRM search
analysis on experimental data derived from different biochemical
techniques in the Rodda dataset. We found that INSECT outper-
forms other tools in terms of sensitivity and specificity in cases
where the true positive is known a priori. We also showed a more
real exploratory analysis with ChIP data from the Boyer dataset.
Finally, we analyzed the genomic environment of different CRMs
detected by displaying them in the UCSC Genome Browser as a
custom track. To detect those genes with more promising TFBS
hits, analysis accounted for whether CRMs were located on re-
gions corresponding to the ENCODE TFs, ChIP-Seq data, his-
tone marks and regions of high transcriptional activity.

Many tools were developed to search for potential TFBSs
within CRMs by implementing PWMs. However, there are
differing criteria for scoring and determining whether a given sub-
sequence is a potential TFBS or not. A group of tools statistically
decides whether a substring constitutes a possible TFBS
comparing its enrichment within a promoter region with respect
to a background set and the subsequent calculation of P-Values.
There are several ways of achieving this comparison, as seen in the
implementation of tools such as CPModule, MotifViz and Cluster
Buster. As P—Value-based algorithms require a background set for
comparison, there are many variables that can affect results that
are not inherent to the PWM deﬁnition itself, but the background.
Some parameters, such as the length of the analyzed sequences,
number of random PWM used to measure enrichment or even the
motif lengths represented by the PWMs, can affect the results
obtained by P—Value-based methods. We considered that normal-
ization of PWM scores by MMSc eliminates this problem, given
that determination of quality for a site does not rely on compari-
son with random sequences, but the PWM itself. The latter relies
on the hypothesis that, if the PWM is representative of the real
motif, the M M Sc value potentially has a more relevant biological
meaning, as it relates directly to the afﬁnity between TFs and their
DNA target sites.

We have built a ﬂexible method that allows researchers to
deﬁne parameters to ﬁnd potential CRMs instead of isolated

sets of TFBSs. By adding the phylogenetic footprinting search
option, INSECT makes CRM identiﬁcation more robust. We
confirmed the search and result display capabilities of INSECT
in two different datasets. The ability to perform analyses that are
usually difﬁcult, or not possible, with most of the available tools,
because they are not available fully as web servers, command line
programs are difﬁcult to use or they do not offer the INSECT
web server functionality, demonstrates the advantages of having
an integrated motif search tool.

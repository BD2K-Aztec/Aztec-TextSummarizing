ABSTRACT

Motivation: RIP-chip is a high-throughput method to identify mRNAs
that are targeted by RNA-binding proteins. The protein of interest is
immunoprecipitated, and the identity and relative amount of mRNA
associated with it is measured on microarrays. Even if a variety of
methods is available to analyse microarray data, e.g. to detect differ-
entially regulated genes, the additional experimental steps in RIP-chip
require specialized methods. Here, we focus on two aspects of
RIP-chip data: First, the efficiency of the immunoprecipitation step
performed in the RIP-chip protocol varies in between different experi-
ments introducing bias not existing in standard microarray experi-
ments. This requires an additional normalization step to compare
different samples and even technical replicates. Second, in contrast
to standard differential gene expression experiments, the distribution
of measurements is not normal. We exploit this fact to define a set of
biologically relevant genes in a statistically meaningful way.

Results: Here, we propose two methods to analyse RIP-chip data: We
model the measurement distribution as a gaussian mixture distribu-
tion, which allows us to compute false discovery rates (FDRs) for any
cut-off. Thus, cut-offs can be chosen for any desired FDR.
Furthermore, we use principal component analysis to determine the
normalization factors necessary to remove immunoprecipitation bias.
Both methods are evaluated on a large RIP-chip dataset measuring
targets of A902, the major component of the microRNA guided
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Using published HITS-CLIP
experiments performed with the same cell line as used for RIP-chip,
we show that the mixture modelling approach is a necessary step to
remove background, which computed FDRs are valid, and that the
additional normalization is a necessary step to make experiments
comparable.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene expression is a highly complex process that is controlled on
multiple levels by various proteins and RNAs. Various experi-
mental protocols have been established to measure expression
levels of mRNAs or proteins, targets of transcription factors or

post-transcriptional regulators and many other parameters of
gene expression in a genome-wide manner. Each step of such a
high-throughput experiment may introduce systematic errors
(bias) or random variation (noise) into the generated data, and
specialized methods are necessary to deal with particular kind of
bias and noise and to answer speciﬁc questions using high-
throughput data.

The most widely used high-throughput experiments are based
on microarrays or next-generation sequencing (NGS) and are
designed to measure the amount of all mRNAs in one or mul-
tiple conditions (Malone and Oliver, 2011). Based on the raw
intensities from a microarray experiment or the sequencing
reads from an NGS experiment, several analytical steps are
taken, including normalization, summarization and statistical
evaluation (Gentleman, 2005). There is a vast amount of litera-
ture describing various methods fulﬁlling these steps to identify
differentially regulated genes (Fundel et al., 2008; Irizarry et al.,
2006; Marioni et al., 2008; Park et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2009).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray ana-
lysis or NGS (ChIP—chip/ChIP—seq) can determine the targets of
DNA-binding proteins and has successfully been applied to a
wide range of transcription factors and cell types (Birney et al.,
2007; Johnson et al., 2007; Ren et al., 2000). In addition to the
above-mentioned analysis methods necessary for microarray and
NGS data, it has been recognized that additional methods are
necessary to successfully determine target sites on the genome,
and thus a variety of methods is described in the literature (Ho
et al., 2011; Park, 2009; Zhu et al., 2010).

In recent years, it has become apparent that transcriptional
regulation is only one part of the machinery carrying out gene
regulation. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and RNA-binding
ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) play important roles and are respon-
sible for splicing, RNA editing, regulation of translation and
RNA degradation (Bartel, 2009; Nishikura, 2006; Witten and
Ule, 2011). These processes are highly regulated by sequence-
speciﬁc binding of RBPs or RNPs to the mRNA. MicroRNAs
are small 2&24 nt long RNA molecules, which have emerged in
recent years as important post-transcriptional regulators
involved in all known multicellular organisms. They play import-
ant roles in development, tumorigenesis and Viral infection. They
act by guiding the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to
mRNAs by binding to their 3/ untranslated region (3/-UTR) in a
sequence-speciﬁc manner, which leads to inhibition of transla-
tion or RNA degradation (Bartel, 2009).

A powerful experimental high-throughput technique to detect
targets of RBPs or ribonucleoproteins, such as RISC, is based on
immunoprecipitation (IP) of the RBP or RNP with associated

mRNAs followed by microarray or NGS measurement
(RIP-chip/RIP—seq) (Hendrickson et al., 2008; Landthaler
et al., 2008; Karginov et al., 2007; Mukherjee et al., 2009;
Stoecklin et al., 2008). Targets of the RBP/RNP are enriched
in the RIP experiment in comparison with a control measure-
ment using an unspeciﬁc antibody or total RNA. Novel tech-
niques including HITS-CLIP, iCLIP and PAR-CLIP also
include cross-linking of the protein to the mRNA followed by
digestion of the unprotected mRNA to determine the precise
location of the target site (Chi et al., 2009; Hafner et al., 2010;
Konig et al., 2010).

The main question in a RIP-chip experiment is to determine
the set of target genes of the immunoprecipitated protein. A basic
answer is a sorted list of enrichment values that can be computed
for each gene by dividing the intensity value in the IP fraction
microarray by the intensity in the control microarray. This is
very similar to standard differential gene expression (DE) experi-
ments: Here, differentially regulated genes can be determined by
a sorted list of fold changes computed for each gene by dividing
the intensity in condition A by the intensity in condition B.
Consequently, RIP-chip data are often analysed using standard
methods borrowed from the DE setup such as fold changes
(Stoecklin et al., 2008), t statistics (Mukherjee et al., 2009) or
moderated t statistics (Hendrickson et al., 2008).

However, as indicated above, additional experimental steps
may introduce additional bias: In contrast to log fold change
distributions of DE experiments, log enrichment distributions
of RIP-chip experiments are not normal but typically have hea-
Vier right tails (Dolken et al., 2010; Mukherjee et al., 2009, see
also Fig. 1). This is an indication that RIP-chip is able to separ-
ate true targets from the background very efﬁciently. Here, we
exploit these skewed distributions to estimate the biological
signiﬁcance of genes. This is different from the statistical

The distributions of the enrichment values are shown. Although the in-
tensity distributions of the various microarrays are properly normalized
using RMA (see Supplementary Fig. S1), the enrichment distributions are
signiﬁcantly different from each other. This is a consequence of differing
IP efﬁciencies and must be accounted for when analysing the respective
data

significance usually computed for DE experiments, where
P-Values are related to the reproducibility of the measurements
and not to biological relevance.

The above-mentioned question about the set of target genes in
a RIP-chip experiment only considers a single condition, in con-
trast to a DE experiment. However, especially for RISC—IP ex-
periments, an additional question is to determine differential
microRNA targets between two or several conditions. For in-
stance, if these conditions are control and transfected microRNA
(Hendrickson et al., 2008), differential targets would be targets of
the transfected microRNA, and if there are uninfected and virus-
infected cells, differential targets would include targets of Viral
microRNAs (Dolken et al., 2010). The answer to this question
can be given by genes that are more enriched in condition A than
in condition B, either by choosing two cut-offs on the corres-
ponding enrichment values (i.e. at leastxfold enriched in A and
at most y fold enriched in B) (Dolken et al., 2010), by computing
diﬂerential enrichment values as the ratio of the two enrichment
values (Hendrickson et al., 2008) or by a mixture of both
approaches (Karginov et al., 2007).

A11 answers to this question necessarily have to compare en-
richment values (i.e. ratios of intensities) of the conditions.
However, IP efficiencies may vary between independent experi-
ments, and it is important to account for this bias when compar-
ing enrichment values. Obviously, the same problem exists for
the summarization of replicate measurements (see Figs 1 and 4).

Here, we develop a suite of methods to properly analyse
RIP-chip datasets, which take care of the unique properties of
such data introduced by the IP: First, we use a Gaussian mixture
model approach to ﬁnd statistically meaningful cut-offs for en-
richment values. We show that this approach can be used to ﬁlter
unexpressed genes, that it allows to compute false discovery rates
(FDRs) for sets of biological significant genes and that it is in
fact a necessary step to make experiments comparable with each
other. We also address the problem of differing IP efﬁciencies by
introducing a principal component analysis (PCA)-based method
to normalize enrichment distributions in a data-dependent
manner. We use publicly available HITS-CLIP data measured
for the same cell lines (Riley et al., 2012) as standard-of—truth for
evaluation and show that the proposed methods provide signiﬁ-
cant improvements for the analysis of RIP-chip data.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data processing

The RIP-chip data for this article has been taken from our study of
herpes viral RISC-IP experiments (Dolken et al., 2010). After the pub-
lication of the original study, additional replicates have been measured,
and all chips including the new ones have been processed as described
(Dolken et al., 2010). Brieﬂy, RNA from Ago2-IPs and either BrdU-IPs
or total RNA have been measured on Affymetrix GeneST arrays, and all
raw data have been normalized using robust multi-array average (RMA)
(Irizarry et al., 2003), logz enrichment values have been computed by
subtracting the control-IP/totai RNA log intensity from the Ago2-IP
log intensity for each probeset and each replicate experiment. Then, pro-
besets have been mapped to Ensembl genes by using the annotation
derived from Biomart. HITS-CLIP clusters (i.e. high conﬁdence
microRNA target sites) used to evaluate the mixture model approach
for the cell line Jijoye has been downloaded from the supplementary

data of Riley et a]. (2012). We also repeated the same analysis using
PAR-CLIP data for Jijoye that has been measured and analysed as
described in Hafner et a]. (2010) in the laboratory of Markus
Landthaler at the MDC Berlin (will be published elsewhere).

2.2 Mixture model ﬁtting

Gaussian mixture models for sets of log enrichment values are ﬁtted using
the Mclust package in R (Fraley and Raftery, 2002). Z-scores for each
gene can then be computed using the background distribution:

e(g) _ Mbg

zscore(g) =
Ubg

(1)
Here, e(g) is the log enrichment of gene g, ubg and obg are the mean and
standard deviation of the background component of the gaussian mixture
model (which we always take as the component with the smaller mean).
The FDR for a cut-off c is defined as the expected fraction of background
genes g}, with e(g;,)>c among all genes g with e(g)>c:

1 — cdfbxc)‘. W (2)

FDR“) Z —i {g|e(g) > c}

caifbg is the cumulative distribution function of the background component
of the mixture model and |BG| the expected number of background genes
(estimated by the mixture model). This is mathematically equivalent the
Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995) for the one-sided P-values derived from the z-scores in
Equation (1) multiplied with the expected fraction of background genes.

For the running window approach (see Section 3.1), we first selected a
window of w genes with the smallest Ago2-IP intensities and ﬁtted the
mixture model (ﬁrst window). Then we removed the s genes with smallest
Ago2-IP intensities and added the next s smallest still unselected genes
and again ﬁtted a mixture model. This step was repeated until the window
reached the top Ago2-IP intensities. For the analyses, we chose w: 1000
and s = 20.

We use two metrics to evaluate the ﬁt of background and target
distributions:

deg. t) = m (3)
Ubg
skewer = —Iog10(ksp(E. — E» (4)

bg and t are the background and target components of the mixture
model, respectively, E is the set of log enrichment values used to ﬁt
the mixture model and ksp(E, — E)is the P-value of the Kolmogorovi
Smirnov test comparing the distribution of E with the distribution of
negated enrichment valuest. Thus, the distance score d(bg, t) measures
the distance of the background and target distributions with respect to the
width of the background distribution, whereas the asymetry score
skew(E) measures the skewness of the distribution without the need to
ﬁt a mixture model.

2.3 PCA

PCA is performed using the function prcomp in R. When there are k
experiments/replicates and, therefore, k log2 enrichment values per gene,
PCA is applied to the k-dimensional space of genes. The ﬁrst principal
component is the direction of the greatest variance, and is used to com-
pute the summary enrichment value é(g) of gene g by taking the dot

product of the replicate measurement z-scores (21(g), ...,zk(g)) and the
direction of the ﬁrst principal component PC 1:
é(g) = (21(g). --..Zk(g))-PC1 (5)

The geometrical interpretation of this weighted average of the replicate
enrichment values is that the dot product does an orthogonal projection

of the k dimensional point g onto the ﬁrst principal component and
measures the distance to the origin.

It is not necessary to centre the points before PCA, as we perform PCA
on the z-scores derived from the mixture modelling approach [see
Equation (1)], the point cloud is naturally centred at the means of the
background distributions, and centring at the overall mean may not be
appropriate. Also, we perform PCA only on targets (as deﬁned by an
FDR of 1%). This is necessary because if the number of background
genes is much higher than the number of target genes, stochasticity in the
background could mask the effects in the target genes to some extent.

Differential targets will deviate from this vector in a speciﬁc direction:
e.g. if we have two replicates of two conditions A and B and, therefore, an
enrichment vector (2,1, ,2“,sz ,zbz), any gene that is target speciﬁcally in
A has greater enrichment in A than in B: 2,,l and 2,,2 is greater than 2b,
and 2b,. Thus, if there are enough differential targets, the second principal
component will point into the direction of the deviations of their enrich-
ment vectors. Therefore, the summarized differential enrichment value
éd(g) can be computed similarly to the overall summary enrichment
value in Equation 5 by taking the dot product of the z-score vector
(21(g), ...,zk(g)) and the direction of the second principal component
PC2:

Mg) = (21(g), - - - .Zk(g))- PCZ (6)

Both the enrichment value é(g) and the differential enrichment value
éd(g) incorporate a linear normalization that removes bias owing to dif-
fering IP efﬁciencies.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Select relevant genes

The ﬁrst step in our analysis of RIP-chip data is the ﬁltering of
unexpressed genes. On modern microarrays, such as the
Affymetrix GeneST arrays, used for our data, probesets against
all known human genes are available. Even if Virtually all pro-
besets have non-zero intensities, we can expect that only a frac-
tion of all genes is expressed in a speciﬁc condition. We noticed
that the asymmetry of the log enrichment distribution is not
observable over the whole range of IP intensities (see Fig. 2a
and Supplementary Fig. S2). For low intensity genes, the distri-
bution indeed looks normal, which is expected for a set of genes
that is not or almost not expressed. Therefore, we used a running
window approach for ﬁtting the mixture model (see Section 2)
and evaluated each window with respect to the distance of the
two components of the ﬁtted model and the extent of asymmetry
(see Fig. 2b). At intensity values BS, a signiﬁcant increase in both
scores was observable. We chose to use all genes above an inten-
sity cut-off where d(bg,t)>1 and skew(E)>2, i.e. where the
means of the two mixture components are at least one standard
deviation away from each other, and where the asymmetry be-
comes significant with P—Value 0.01.

We performed this running window approach for all previ-
ously published RIP-chip experiments from Dolken et al.
(2010) and for two additional replicates of the control cell line
DG75-eGFP and the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-infected cell line
Jijoye, respectively. For the additional DG75-eGFP replicates,
the microarrays showed poor RNA quality and applying our
running window approach to these bad quality experiments
indeed did not yield a mixture model (see Fig. 2c). Thus, we
can apply our method also for filtering poor quality experiments

Fig. 2. Selecting expressed genes. 21 shows a density scatterplot of the log IP intensities against the log enrichment values of all genes for the ﬁrst Jijoye
RIP-chip replicate. The running window mixture models for the three indicated vertical lines are shown in Supplementary Figure S2. In b and c, the
distance and asymmetry scores are plotted for all windows for replicate one and three of the DG7S-eGFP experiment. Starting from intensity values of
85, the distribution seems to be a mixture of two normal distributions. In contrast to the ﬁrst replicate, the third does not show the expected behaviour of
the mixture of a background and target distribution, which was a consequence of poor RNA quality in this experiment

from a dataset, and we excluded the two additional DG75-eGFP
replicates from further analyses accordingly.

We also noticed that the background distribution is not the
same over the whole spectrum of intensity values. Therefore, we
computed z—scores for each gene using mean and standard devi-
ations obtained from the running window approach. This is very
similar to well-known non-linear normalization techniques
Wang et al., 2002), with the difference that the model for nor-
malization is not ﬁtted to all data but only to the background.

3.2 Determining microRNA targets

Computing z—scores from the raw enrichment values based on
the fitted background distribution can be interpreted as a sub-
traction of this background. The background here does not con-
sist of the unexpressed genes, but of the expressed but not
targeted genes. This background subtraction step can have a
great effect: For the four Jijoye RIP-chip replicates, we observe
that without subtraction, it seems that the IPs of replicates three
and four were more efﬁcient than of the other two replicates, as
there are more genes enriched >2-fold, for instance (see Fig. 3a
and b). However, after background subtraction, replicates one
and two show a larger fraction of enriched genes.

Obviously, if an IP was more efﬁcient than another, its
induced ranking of genes will better predict a gold standard of
microRNA targets. HITS-CLIP is an experimental technique
that is able to identify target sites of microRNAs with high con-
ﬁdence (Chi et al., 2009). Thus, using the publicly available
HITS-CLIP data for Jijoye (Riley et al., 2012), we can construct
a gold standard by taking all genes as true targets that have at
least n HITS-CLIP target sites. Independent on the choice of n,
replicates one and two induce rankings that are in better agree-
ment with HITS-CLIP data (see Fig. 3c for n=1), and thus,
background subtraction is a necessary step. We also repeated
this analysis using in—house, unpublished PAR-CLIP data for
Jijoye (~14.000 sites on ~5500 genes, will be published else-
where) leading to the same conclusions (data not shown).

Furthermore, we propose that the fitted background distri-
bution allows to compute valid FDRs for microRNA targets.
For a cut-off c, the FDR is deﬁned as the expected fraction of

non-target genes. Obviously, a non-target gene should contain
less HITS-CLIP target sites than target genes on average. If we
compute the average number of HITS-CLIP target sites per gene
for the set of targets deﬁned by cut-off c on the RIP-chip data,
the dependence on the corresponding FDR should thus be linear
with a negative slope: For instance, if the FDR is twice as high,
we expect twice as many non-target genes. Therefore, the average
number of HITS-CLIP target sites per gene should decrease by a
factor that is dependent on the true average number of
HITS-CLIP targets sites per target gene and non-target gene.
For all four replicates, the plot of the FDR against the fraction
of HITS-CLIP target sites per gene is roughly a straight line (see
Supplementary Fig. S3), and even if the enrichment/z—score dis-
tributions are different, the slopes and intercepts of linear ﬁts to
all four plots are very similar to each other (see Supplementary
Fig. S4).

This also allows us to estimate the average number of
HITS-CLIP target sites per target gene and non-target gene by
taking the value of the linear fit at FDR: 0% and
FDR: 100%, respectively. Based on the RIP-chip data as a
reference, we can estimate that HITS-CLIP produces 30.8
target sites per expressed target gene and 30.2 target sites per
non-target gene (see Supplementary Fig. S4).

3.3 Taking replicates into account

As indicated above, IP efﬁciencies between replicate experiments
may be very different from each other. These differences intro-
duce bias into such a dataset, and no RIP-chip study known to
us has properly accounted for that. Our mixture model approach
also cannot remove this bias from RIP-chip data. The problem
becomes obvious when we Visually inspect scatterplots across
replicate enrichment values/z-scores.

For replicates one and two of our Jijoye RIP-chip data, the
main cloud of target genes roughly scatters around the main
diagonal in Figure 4a, whereas for the comparison of replicates
one and three, the diagonal is far away from the main cloud
(Fig. 4b). The canonical way for summarizing replicates is to
take the unweighted mean of the enrichment values/z-scores.
This can geometrically be interpreted as an orthogonal

Fig. 4. Differing IP efﬁciencies require normalization before computing summary values. In contrast to replicates one and two of the Jijoye RIP-chip
experiments, where IP efﬁciencies are very similar (a), replicate three is different (b). Normalizing replicates using the ﬁrst principal component (PCl)
signiﬁcantly improves the summary z-score with respect to HITS-CLIP data as reference: The difference of the normalized score to the un-normalized
score is signiﬁcantly greater for genes with HITS-CLIP target sites (coloured distributions) in comparison with all differences (black distribution). The
improvement is even more pronounced for genes with multiple HITS-CLIP target sites (c)

projection onto the diagonal vector d =(0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25)
and measuring the distance of the projected point to the origin.
Thus, all four-dimensional points lying on any hyperplane or-
thogonal to d would get the same summary value. Such a hyper-
plane would not cut the main cloud of target genes in the scatter
plot of replicates one and three orthogonally, which is only a
consequence of different IP efﬁciencies.

However, the ﬁrst principal component of this point cloud
defines such orthogonal hyperplanes, and we use the components
of the corresponding rotation vector to compute a weighted
mean accounting for all linear effects of differing IP efﬁciencies.

We can evaluate this additional step again by using the
HITS-CLIP data as reference. We consider the differences be-
tween each normalized summary value and the corresponding
un—normalized value. The difference for HITS-CLIP sites con-
taining genes is statistically signiﬁcantly greater than for other
genes (P<10_14, KohnogoroveSmirnov test, see Fig. 4c), and
the more HITS-CLIP targets sites are found for a gene, the
more pronounced is its positive change.

3.4 Determining differential microRNA targets

To ﬁnd differential microRNA targets, experiments of different
conditions must be compared, i.e. genes must be identiﬁed, which

are more enriched in one condition in comparison with the other.
Obviously, a similar problem as in the summarization of repli-
cates plays a role: How can we account for differing IP efﬁcien-
cies if we compare four replicates of the EBV-infected cell line
Jijoye to the two replicates of the control cell line DG75-eGFP?

We can extend our method for summarizing replicates to the
differential problem: The first principal component corresponds
to the direction of greatest variance, which is the direction of
common targets under the assumption that there are enough
common targets (both are B cell lines). Differential microRNA
targets exclusive to J ij oye should have positive enrichment values
in the Jijoye RIP-chip replicates and smaller values in
DG75-eGFP. These targets induce variance into the correspond-
ing direction of the six-dimensional space such that the second
principal component corresponds to the IP efﬁciency normalized
direction of differential targets (see Fig. 5a).

To compare the PC2 normalized differential enrichment values
to the un-normalized differential enrichment (i.e. subtract the
enrichment mean of DG75-eGFP from the mean of Jijoye), we
exploit the fact that microRNAs are able to downregulate ex-
pression of target mRNAs (Bartel, 2009; Guo et al., 2010), and
that mRNA levels were measured as well in the RIP-chip experi-
ment: x fold downregulated genes get consistently and

Fig. 5. Differing IP efﬁciencies require normalization before computing differential targets. The second principal component in a is able to discover the
experimental structure. Its loadings can be used as weights to compute a differential enrichment value that is normalized for different IP efﬁciencies, in
contrast to the standard way of subtracting the mean log enrichment in DG75-eGFP from the mean log enrichment in Jijoye (corresponding to weights
indicated in red). The difference distribution of the normalized differential enrichment values and the un-normalized ones is shown in b. Differential
targets are expected to be downregulated, and indeed, the difference is signiﬁcantly greater than background for downregulated genes. As illustrated in c,

this effect is more pronounced the higher the downregulation is

signiﬁcantly higher scores after normalization as compared with
all other genes, independent on the choice of x (see Fig. 5). Thus,
after normalization, signiﬁcantly more RIP-chip targets are
downregulated than without normalization (independent on the
particular threshold used to deﬁne RIP-chip targets and down-
regulated genes).

4 DISCUSSION

A similar approach to our Gaussian mixture modelling (GMM)
has already been used in (Mukherjee et al., 2009); however,
GMM was applied to summarized enrichment values, and log
odds ratios (LOD scores) were computed as the ratio of the two
scaled mixture components. LOD scores were then used in two
different ways: First, they were directly subjected to gene set
enrichment analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005), where they
have no advantage over directly using enrichment values (as
the weighted KolmogoroveSmirnov statistic used for gene set
enrichment analysis is non-parametric and only sensitive to the
ranking of the genes). Second, the authors used a cut-off of LCD
>0 to define a set of targets. However, choosing a cut-off based
on the LCD is still arbitrary and not statistically meaningful in
contrast to our FDRs. If we used the LCD to define a cut-off, we
would get FDRs ranging from 5 to 15% in our experimental
dataset.

We could show that our reﬁned mixture modelling approach
has several advantages: First, it allows us to ﬁlter unexpressed
genes. When comparing two conditions (e.g. Virus infected cells
expressing Viral microRNAs versus non-infected cells), expres-
sion of a gene targeted by cellular microRNAs below the detec-
tion limit of the microarray in one, but not the other cell line,
would result in the misinterpretation of this to be a target of the
Viral microRNAs. Second, for experiments with poor IP efﬁ-
ciency, we observed extremely poor distance and asymmetry
scores over the whole intensity range and could remove these
bad replicates from further analyses. Third, it helps to compare
experiments with each other (see Fig. 3c) and finally, we can
compute valid FDRs.

Furthermore, the comparison of the RIP-chip FDRs to
HITS-CLIP data revealed important properties of both the
RIP-chip and HITS-CLIP techniques: Both are designed to iden-
tify microRNA targets, and, naturally, they agree signiﬁcantly
(P<2.2 x 10‘16, KolmogoroveSmimov test), a fact that is also
reﬂected in the negative slope of the linear fit to the FDR against
sites per gene plot. However, the agreement is not perfect, and we
estimate an average number of 30.8 HITS-CLIP target sites per
RIP-chip target gene and of 30.2 per RIP-chip non-target gene.
Even if HITS-CLIP target sites may be erroneous, and the CLIP
techniques may implicate additional bias (Konig et al., 2010;
Kishore et al., 2011), we expect that not all of the 30.2 sites
per background gene are true errors: Such inconsistencies may
be due to differing experimental steps (e.g. different antibodies
used for IP) or due to differences the Jijoye cell cultures have
accumulated in the two laboratories since the cell line has been
established. Also, as HITS-CLIP does not control for target
mRNA abundance, it may ﬁnd several weak sites on highly
expressed genes that are biologically irrelevant (i.e. not contribut-
ing significantly to regulation of its expression). Such a gene
should not be enriched in a RIP-chip experiment and could
explain many cases of HITS-CLIP sites on background genes.
Thus, even if CLIP techniques have several advantages (e. g. they
are able to identify target sites instead of target genes), RIP-chip
is still a useful complementary method.

The second, novel method introduced in this article is to use
principal components to normalize for different IP efﬁciencies.
Evaluation using HITS-CLIP data or the differential expression
of target genes shows that the normalization improves results
significantly. The normalization proposed can only account for
linear bias between experiments. This very lenient normalization
appears to be sufﬁcient, as afﬁne offsets are already removed by
the mixture model approach, and non-linear effects are not rec-
ognizable in a Visual inspection.

Our proposed methods do not include a way to compute stat-
istical signiﬁcance, e. g. like a t-test for standard DE experiment.
However, this can be accomplished in a straight-forward way, as
all available tests could directly be used after our linear normal-
ization has been applied to a dataset.

RIP-chip enrichment analysis

 

5 CONCLUSON

In this article, we presented methods we developed to analyse
RIP-chip data. In comparison with standard DE experiments,
the additional IP step introduces special requirements for the
data analyis. First, we use GMM to determine biologically sig-
niﬁcant target genes; second, we use a linear normalization tech-
nique based on PCA to remove bias introduced by the IP. The
evaluation of both methods using independent data showed a
significant improvement in comparison with standard
approaches: The background of not enriched genes can be
removed, valid FDRs can be calculated and the comparability
of both replicates and differential experiments is improved.

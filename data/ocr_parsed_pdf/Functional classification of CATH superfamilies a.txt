Abstract

Motivation: Computational approaches that can predict protein functions are essential to bridge
the widening function annotation gap especially since <1.0% of all proteins in UniProtKB have
been experimentally characterized. We present a domain—based method for protein function
classification and prediction of functional sites that exploits functional sub—classification of CATH
superfamilies. The superfamilies are sub—classified into functional families (FunFams) using a hier—
archical clustering algorithm supervised by a new classification method, FunFHMMer.

Results: FunFHMMer generates more functionally coherent groupings of protein sequences than
other domain—based protein classifications. This has been validated using known functional infor—
mation. The conserved positions predicted by the FunFams are also found to be enriched in known
functional residues. Moreover, the functional annotations provided by the FunFams are found to
be more precise than other domain—based resources. FunFHMMer currently identifies 110439
FunFams in 2735 superfamilies which can be used to functionally annotate >16 million domain
sequences.

Availability and implementation: All FunFam annotation data are made available through the
CATH webpages (http://www.cathdb.info). The FunFHMMer webserver (http://www.cathdb.info/
search/by_funfhmmer) allows users to submit query sequences for assignment to a CATH FunFam.

1 Introduction

 

The rapid increase in sequencing and structural genomics initiatives
have provided us with a wealth of data to unravel the complex se—
quence, structure and function relationships in proteins.
However, < 1.0% of this data are functionally annotated from ex—
perimental studies (UniProtKB, January 2015).

The most commonly used methods for protein function annota—
tion often exploit a sequence or structure homology search of a
query protein against a protein database, although more sophisti—
cated approaches which also exploit heterogeneous data (e.g. gene
expression and protein—protein interaction data, etc.) and combine

this diverse information using machine—learning approaches have
also been developed. [For a review of current approaches, see
Radivojac et al. (2013)]. It has been observed that proteins sharing
high sequence or structural similarity can often evolve different
(sub—)functions (Bashton and Chothia, 2007; Glasner et (11., 2006;
Hannenhalli and Russell, 2000). These functionally diverse relatives
perform distinct functions even though they may share a general
functional feature, e.g. for enzymes this may be a common step
along their reaction pathways. Such groups of homologous proteins
sharing the same function will be referred to as functional families
hereafter.

A domain—based approach for protein function annotation

3461

 

Classification of protein space into functional families is useful for
annotating uncharacterized sequences by inheriting annotations from
characterized sequences in the family the query sequence matches
best. The identification of functional families and characterization of
their functional sites is also important for understanding how function
is modulated during evolution by sequence and structural changes in
diverse homologous groups (Hannenhalli and Russell, 2000).

Protein—based family resources like PANTHER (Mi et (11., 2013),
TIGRFAMs (Haft et (11., 2013), HAMAP (Lima et (11., 2009) and
specialized databases like Structure—Function Linkage Database
(SFLD) (Akiva et (11., 2014), TEED (Widmann et (11., 2010) provide
manually curated functional grouping of protein sequences which
are limited by low sequence coverage. Using more automated
approaches, ProtoNet (Rappoport et (11., 2014) provides an
automatic classification of similar proteins which are further sub—
classified into clusters using an information—theoretic protocol based
on available annotations. Another automated protein family
resource, PhyloFacts (Krishnamurthy et (11., 2006) provides a collec—
tion of protein families which have been further classified into subfa—
milies by the SCI—PHY algorithm which uses Bayesian and
information—theoretic measures to construct a hierarchical phylo—
genetic tree and determine an optimal cut of the tree into families
(Sjolander, 1998).

When global protein homology searches fail, i.e. an
uncharacterized protein cannot be assigned to any characterized
whole protein families, function can perhaps be better understood
by analysing its domain components and finding functionally
characterized homologs for each domain. Exploiting this approach,
a ‘domain grammar’, (Dessailly et (11., 2009) which exploits informa—
tion from a protein domain resource, can be used to describe protein
function.

There are many protein domain resources which provide classifi—
cations of protein domains based on either sequence (e.g. Pfam) or
structure [e.g. CATH (Sillitoe et (11., 2015) and SCOP (Murzin et (11.,
1995)]. Pfam (Sonnhammer et (11., 1997) is the most comprehensive
and widely used database of protein domain families. The Pfam ver—
sion 27.0 release comprises 14 831 manually curated Pfam—A fami—
lies which provides ~80% coverage of the UniProtKB sequence
space (Finn et (11., 2014). The Funshift (Abhiman and Sonnhammer,
2005) database classifies Pfam version 12.0 families into subfamilies
using the SCI—PHY algorithm and provides analysis of function
shifts of subfamilies within a Pfam family (Brown et (11., 2007;
Sjolander, 1998).

The protein structure classification databases CATH (Sillitoe
et (11., 2015) and SCOP (Murzin et (11., 1995) extracts structural in—
formation from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and classifies protein
domains into evolutionary—related superfamilies based on their evo—
lutionary origin, exploiting structural data to bring together very
distant evolutionary—related domains in a superfamily. Additionally,
Gene3D (Lees et (11., 2014) and SUPERFAMILY (de Lima Morais
et (11., 2011) provide broader sequence coverage for each superfam—
ily in CATH and SCOP, respectively.

SCOP sub—classifies its superfamilies into manually curated fami—
lies. However, these have been found to more closely resemble taxo—
nomic groups rather than functional groups (Pethica et (11., 2012). A
few protein resources like InterPro (Mitchell et (11., 2015) and the
Conserved Domain Database (CDD) (Marchler—Bauer et (11., 2015)
also combine multiple protein domain family databases like Pfam,
SMART, TIGRFAM among others, providing higher sequence
coverage compared with individual resources. Thus, it can be clearly
seen that although, there are several well—established resources for
classifying homologous sequences into protein or domain families,

most have not traditionally sub—classified relatives according to
functional similarity using automated approaches, because of the
complex nature of this task.

Sequences in the CATH—Gene3D resource have been classified
into functional families or FunFams by cutting a hierarchical tree of
sequence relatives produced by a clustering algorithm, GeMMA
(Lee et (11., 2010) at a generic threshold. This was later improved by
the Domain Family Exploration (DFX) algorithm which used func—
tion annotation data from the Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner
et (11., 2000) to sub—classify the superfamilies into FunFams
(Rentzsch and Orengo, 2013). However, due to the paucity of the
GO terms and annotation biases existing in the GO (Schnoes et (11.,
2013), new approaches for functionally classifying CATH superfa—
milies have been explored which exploit sequence patterns, and are
unaffected by the limitations of GO.

Here, we present a new and much more accurate method for
functional classification of CATH superfamilies into FunFams that
can be used for protein function annotation and prediction of func—
tionally important residues. The new protocol, FunFHMMer, deter—
mines an optimal cut of a hierarchical clustering tree of sequence
relatives within a given superfamily by calculating a novel functional
coherence index based on conserved positions and specificity—
determining positions (SDPs) in sequence alignments. Prediction of
SDPs has been used in the past to generate functional groups for a
number of selected protein superfamilies (Costa et (11., 2013; Mazin
et (11., 2010; Rausell et (11., 2010; Reva et (11., 2007). However, none
of these approaches has been used for large—scale sub—classification
of all known protein domain superfamilies. Moreover, these
methods also require an accurate multiple—sequence alignment of all
sequences as a starting point which can lead to erroneous sub—
classification of very large and diverse superfamilies.

The functional purity of the classification has been validated by
known functional information. For example, the predicted con—
served sites of the FunFams are found to be enriched in experimen—
tally characterized functional residues and the functional
annotations provided by FunFams are found to be more precise
compared with those generated by other domain—based resources.
Furthermore, the FunFHMMer prediction protocol is able to pro—
vide functional annotations for nearly >16 million domain se—
quences in UniProtKB and Ensembl.

2 Methods

2.1 Superfamily sequence clustering

For each CATH—Gene3D superfamily, the sequences are first pre—
clustered at 90% sequence identity into S90 clusters using CD—HIT
(Fu et (11., 2012). All sequences are associated with G0 annotations
from UniProt—GOA (dated May 2013). Any S90 cluster which lacks
at least one sequence with high—quality GO annotations is removed,
as each family must contain at least one relative with reliable func—
tion annotations for annotation transfer to uncharacterized se—
quences. High—quality GO annotations were considered to be those
which were Inferred from Electronic Annotations (IEAs) in
Swiss—Prot made by EC2GO or Swiss—Prot Keyword2GO mapping
methods as well as annotations experimentally inferred or curated
(non—IEA) in UniProtKB (Rentzsch and Orengo, 2013; Skunca et (11.,
2012). Fragments (< 80% of the average sequence length) are then
removed from the remaining clusters. These clusters form the start—
ing clusters for the profile—based agglomerative clustering algorithm,
GeMMA (Lee et (11., 2010). GeMMA exploits COMPASS (Sadreyev
and Grishin, 2003) to compare the profiles derived from the

multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of clusters present at each
stage of the clustering. At each iteration, the cluster profiles match—
ing above a threshold are merged and profiles are generated for the
new clusters. These iterations continue giving a hierarchical cluster—
ing tree built from the leaf nodes to the root, till a single cluster
remains.

2.2 FunFHMMer algorithm

The FunFHMMer algorithm is an automated classification protocol
that determines the optimal cut of this ‘bottom—up’ hierarchical clus—
tering tree (Supplementary Fig. S1) to identify FunFams in protein
domain superfamilies. It identifies highly conserved positions and
SDPs in cluster alignments (Fig. 1) and calculates a novel Functional
Coherence index (FC) for each parent node in the tree. This value is
to determine whether the child nodes should be merged.

The conserved positions in all sequences in an alignment are gen—
erally important for the stability, folding or function of the protein
domain. In contrast, SDPs or positions conserved within groups of
sequences which share a specific (sub—)function, are usually involved
in functional divergence (Abhiman and Sonnhammer, 2005; Rausell
et al., 2010).

2.2.1 Functional coherence index (FC)
The analysis of functional coherence of a parent node takes into ac—
count the following parameters:

1. Information content of MSAs. An MSA which comprises evolu—
tionary distant relatives is considered to be highly informative. The
diversity of residue conservation of positions in informative MSAs
not only helps to prevent bias but also provides more discriminating
conservation scores (Bartlett et al., 2002).

FunFHMMer calculates Diversity of Position Scores (DOPS) for
MSAs using Scorecons (Valdar, 2002). DOPS is 0 if all positions in
an alignment have the same conservation score and 100 when no
two positions have the same conservation score. For our analysis,
we have considered any alignment with a DOPS > 70, as sufficiently
diverse (Dessailly et al., 2013). For less diverse alignments, any MSA
analysis will have a higher probability of predicting false positives
(false SDPs, in this case) as a result of less discriminatory conserva—
tion scores. To account for this, a DOPS factor (Df) is used, where

Speciﬁcity Determining positions (SDPs)

each colour denotes a unique function. The schematic representation of the
parent node MSA and the child nodes MSA is shown along with the phylo-
genetic tree. Child nodes are separated by a dashed line. Conserved positions
in the MSA are shown in red and the SDPs are shown in green or yellow for
different child nodes

Df : 1, if both groups have DOPS > 70 and Df : 0, if either sub—
group have DOPS < 70.

2. Proportion of predicted SDPs in an MSA. FunFHMMer uses
GroupSim (Capra and Singh, 2008) to predict SDPs in MSAs of par—
ent nodes in the clustering tree. GroupSim takes an MSA containing
pre—defined groups (clusters associated with two child nodes in the
tree) as input and calculates a prediction score (G5) for each column
in the alignment. G5 ranges from 0 to 1 where higher scores indicate
a higher probability for a column in an alignment to be an SDP.

In order to discriminate easily between conserved positions and
SDPs using G5, a threshold was identified that distinguishes between
these positions using a benchmark dataset generated by
Chakraborty and Chakrabarti (2015) (Supplementary Section S2).
Henceforth, we defined all positions with (G530.3) as conserved
positions and those with 0.7< G5 3 1 as SDPs in our subsequent
analysis of parent nodes.

For each parent node being analysed by FunFHMMer, its child
nodes form the predefined groups for GroupSim. The number of
SDPs (Nsdp) and the number of conserved positions (NC) are calcu—
lated from the Groupsim prediction scores for the parent node
MSA. Whether two child nodes are merged depends on the ratio of
SDPs to conserved positions in the parent node MSA (dep).
However, optimization trials showed that this ratio (dep) needed to
be adjusted if one or both the child nodes had a low DOPS score.
The dep ratio for a parent node is therefore calculated as:

Nsdp Nsdp
R : D — — .2 1 — D — 1 1
sdp  + NSdp 0 + (  NC ( i

where D,: is the DOPS factor of the MSA, Nsdp is the number of SDPs,
NC is the number of conserved positions in the MSA. For more details

 

on how Equation (1) was derived, see Supplementary Section S3.

3. Gaps in an MSA. A large number of gaps in a parent node align—
ment would indicate that the group alignments are of different
lengths. The coherence index uses a gap factor fgap which is
dependant on the number of non—gapped (Nnongap) and gapped
positions (Ngap) in the alignment. Such that, fgap : 0, if Nnongap
> Ngap and fgap : 1, if Nnongap g Ngap in MSA.

Bringing together all the above parameters, the Functional
Coherence index (FC) is calculated using the empirical formula
described later (Equation 2), where a coherence index of 1 indicates
functional coherence of the parent node and 0 indicates that function—
ally diverse child nodes have been merged to form the parent node.

1 ifde fa go
PC : _ P g P (2)
0 lfRSdpfgap > 0

where, dep is the SDP ratio (Equation 1) and fgap is the gap factor.
The functional coherence index is used to ensure that only func—
tionally related clusters are merged. The resulting clusters of the tree
form the functional families (FunFams) for a protein domain super—
family. The workﬂow for the FunFHMMer algorithm is shown in
Supplementary Figure S4. Once the functional families have been
identified sequence patterns (hidden Markov models, HMMs) are
derived for each and used to identify further relatives in UniProtKB.

2.3 FunFam model generation and mapping of

family relatives

For each FunFam in a superfamily, an alignment is generated using
MAFFT (Katoh et al., 2002) and a profile HMM is built using

HMMER3 (Eddy, 2010). A model—specific inclusion threshold score
is then determined for each family model by choosing the lowest
HMM bit score obtained by scanning all the sequences from which
a model was built, against the model itself. After this, all sequences
from Gene3D not clustered into an S90 cluster at the start of cluster—
ing, are scanned against the family models and a sequence is ac—
cepted as a new member of a FunFam if it exceeds the inclusion
threshold score of the respective family model.

2.4 Identification of functionally important residues
i n F u n Fa m s
Ideally, FunFams are groups of protein domains with a high probability
of sharing the same function(s) and therefore the functionally import—
ant residues (e.g. catalytic residues, ligand—binding residues) in a family
are also expected to be highly conserved. For FunFams with sufficient
information content in their MSA, residue conservation scores are cal—
culated for each position in the alignment using Scorecons (Valdar,
2002). Scorecons scores range from 0 to 1 and residues having scores
2 0.7 are considered to be highly conserved (Dessailly et al., 2013).
Overlaps between conserved positions in FunFams and known
catalytic residues taken from the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA) (Porter et
al., 2004) were evaluated using enrichment tests adapted from
Dessailly et al. (2013). For each FunFam, enrichment values were cal—
culated as the difference between the proportion of conserved residues
that are catalytic and the proportion of all residues that are catalytic.
The enrichment values were averaged for each superfamily and an un—
paired, one—sided Wilcoxon rank sum test (Kruskal, 1957) was run on
the averaged values using the wilcox.test function in R (Team, 2014).
This test assessed a P—value for the null hypothesis that the proportion
of conserved catalytic residues is the same as the proportion of uncon—
served functional residues i.e. the median enrichment value is zero.

2.5 Functional annotation of uncharacterized sequences
Uncharacterized protein sequences are scanned against a library of
HMMs of CATH superfamilies and domain regions assigned to
superfamilies using DomainFinder3 (Yeats et al., 2010) [Fig. 2(ii)].
The domain sequences are then scanned against the CATH FunFam
models for the given superfamily using HMMER3 (Eddy, 2010) and
mapped to their most likely FunFam i.e. the model matched with the
highest HMM score, [Fig. 2(iii)] if it achieves the inclusion threshold
score of the respective family model.

The GO term annotations of that FunFam are then transferred
to the query sequence in a probabilistic manner which is calculated
as the annotation frequency of a particular GO term among the seed
sequences of the FunFam [Fig. 2(iii)—(iv)]. The GO term confidence
scores are subsequently propagated up the GO hierarchy (Fig. 2(vi)].
Finally, the non—redundant set of constituent domain GO term as—
signments for each domain region in the protein sequence, each GO
term retaining its highest confidence score, together make up the
function predictions for the whole—protein.

2.6 Assessment of functional purity of FunFams

To assess whether sub—classifying the domain data in CATH—
Gene3D into FunFams by FunFHMMer improved the functional
purity of the FunFams and the ability to use them to transfer func—
tional annotation, we performed the following tests: (i) assessment
of the quality of functional classification using known functional in—
formation (EC numbers) and (ii) analysis of the predictive power of
CATH—Gene3D FunFams using a UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot rollback as—
sessment. In these, we compared FunFHMMer against our previous
functional classification method, DFX and other domain—family

classifications i.e. Pfam, SUPERFAMILY and CDD. The domain
families and superfamilies in these resources have not been explicitly
classified according to function and therefore, the only purpose of
including them in the assessment was to determine whether there
was any benefit in function annotation transfer from sub—classifica—
tion of the CATH—Gene3D resource into FunFams.

2.6.1 Quality of functional classification based on EC numbers

This test (referred to as the EC assessment hereafter) was used to
analyse the performance of protein classifications in distinguishing
between sequence relatives having different EC numbers as consis—
tency of EC numbers across a group of sequence relatives is clearly
indicative of functional purity. The FunFams generated by
FunFHMMer for both CATH superfamilies and Pfam—A families
were assessed as were DFX FunFams, CATH superfamilies, Pfam—A
families, superfamilies in SUPERFAMILY and families in

SUPERFAMILY. Although CATH, Pfam and SUPERFAMILY are
not publicized as functional classifications, these resources are fre—
quently used for functional annotation of query sequences.

The EC annotations of all FunFam sequences in CATH were ex—
tracted from UniProtKB (dated February 2013) but we only con—
sidered those which had a four—digit EC number associated with the
whole protein. These sequences were mapped to the different pro—
tein classifications used in the assessment and the number of differ—
ent unique EC numbers per family or superfamily was analysed.

2.6.2 UniProtKB/SWiss-Prot rollback assessment

A CAFA—style assessment was generated by rolling back the
UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot database dated November 2013 to May 2013
(6 months before). The assessment comprised well—annotated se—
quences which did not have any reported GO terms (having GO evi—
dence codes: EXP, IDA, IMP, IGI, IEP, TAS or IC) in the Molecular
Function Ontology (MFO) in the May 28, 2013 version of
UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot, but had MFO annotations associated with
them in the November 28, 2013 version. This resulted in a dataset
of 1945 proteins. The distribution of leaf term (MFO) annotations
of the assessment proteins is shown in Supplementary Figure S5.
Sequence MD5 (a 32 character hexadecimal number) of the query
sequences were used to map sequences between databases (Smith
et al., 2005). Sequences were scanned against FunFams generated by
DFX and FunFHMMer to predict functions for this dataset using
the protocols described earlier and high—quality MFO annotations
(Section 2.1 for details) available up to May 2013. The functional
annotations assigned by FunFams generated by FunFHMMer were
compared with the annotations provided by Pfam (version 27.0) and
CDD (version 3.10) family matches (Supplementary Section S5.2).
Pfam and CDD were chosen for the assessment as Pfam is the most
comprehensive manually curated domain—based resource which is
widely used by biologists for functional annotation and CDD is a
widely used comprehensive protein resource that integrates multiple
curated protein and protein domain family databases such as Pfam,
SMART, COGs (Cluster of Orthologous Groups), TIGRFAMs,
NCBI Protein Clusters and NCBI Curated Domains. Each classifica—
tion protocol was evaluated only on the subset of the assessment
dataset for which it predicted at least one GO annotation.

The performance of the functions predicted by different classifi—
cation methods was measured using Precision—Recall (PR) graphs
by comparing the maximum F—measure (Fmax) (harmonic mean
between precision and recall) values in the same manner as used
by Radivojac et al. (2013) in the CAFA (Critical Assessment of
protein Function Annotation) function prediction assessment
(Supplementary Section S53).

2.7 Generation of CATH superfamily networks

CATH superfamily networks are constructed in which FunFams are
represented by nodes and the edge distances correspond to the se—
quence similarity between the FunFams, assessed using Profile
Comparer (PRC) (Madera, 2008) which compares the sequence pro—
files derived from the multiple alignments of the families. The net—
works are visualized in the prefuse force—directed layout with edges
weighted by the PRC score using the Data—Driven Documents (D3)
JavaScript library (Bostock et al., 2011).

3 Experiments and results

3.1 Generation of CATH FunFams
FunFHMMer was used to generate a new set of FunFams for CATH
v4.0 (Sillitoe et al., 2015). A total of 110 439 FunFams were

generated by FunFHMMer for 2735 CATH superfamilies. By scan—
ning UniProtKB sequences against CATH—Gene3D and FunFam
HMMs (see Section 2.3 in Methods), > 16 million sequences can be
mapped to the FunFams and annotated with functional information.
All FunFam data are made available through the CATH webpages
which provides a listing of FunFams within each superfamily. For
each FunFam, visualization of the MSA is provided, which is also
available for download.

FunFHMMer was also used to generate FunFams for 14 831
Pfam—A families giving 172 211 Pfam—A FunFams. In the text below,
Pfam families that have not been sub—classified using FunFHMMer
are referred to as Pfam (native) families. FunFams were also gener—
ated for the CATH superfamiles using the DFX algorithm which re—
sulted in 26 760 DFX FunFams.

3.2 Functionally important residues are highly
conserved in FunFams

The conserved residues in FunFam alignments (Section 2.4) were
found to be significantly enriched in known catalytic residues, i.e.
FunFams have a greater proportion of conserved catalytic residues
in comparison to unconserved catalytic residues (P—value< 3.64E—
51). Moreover, the FunFams were also found to have a larger pro—
portion of conserved catalytic residues compared with our previous
classification (Supplementary Section S6). The highly conserved resi—
dues in the FunFams identified by FunFHMMer are highlighted on a
representative 3D—structure for the FunFam and can be viewed on
the CATH webpages.

3.3 Assessment of functional purity of FunFams

3.3.1 Quality of functional classification using EC numbers

The EC assessment dataset (Section 2.6.1) in CATH, consisting of
670128 sequences, mapped to 1664 CATH superfamilies, 33 668
CATH FunFams generated by FunFHMMer, 9215 CATH FunFams
generated by DFX, 4856 Pfam (native) families, 24 789 Pfam
FunFams generated by FunFHMMer, 1187 superfamilies in
SUPERFAMILY and 2509 families in SUPERFAMILY.

Figure 3 shows the proportions of different sequence groupings
(families or superfamilies) generated by the above—mentioned pro—
tein classifications having relatives with one or many different EC
numbers. The figure has been truncated to show the proportion of
families or superfamilies, up to a maximum of 10 different ECs per
sequence grouping by a classification protocol. The highest propor—
tion of families found to have only one EC number associated with
them were CATH FunFams (86.5%) and the Pfam FunFams
(85.5%) generated by FunFHMMer, followed by CATH FunFams
(71.9%) generated by DFX, Pfam (native) families (51.6%), CATH
superfamilies (37.7%), families in SUPERFAMILY (35.8%) and
superfamilies in SUPERFAMILY (30.7%). This illustrates that the
FunFams generated by FunFHMMer provide a more functionally
coherent grouping of protein sequences than the other domain clas—
sifications. Moreover, it also shows that the FunFHMMer classifica—
tion protocol is not limited in its use to CATH but can also be used
to sub—classify other widely used domain—based classification re—
sources such as Pfam.

Furthermore, we also assessed the quality of our functional sub—
classification by comparing functional assignments against the re—
nowned SFLD which has been used in benchmarking other func—
tional classifications (Brown et al., 2007 and Lee et al., 2010).
Results are given in the Supplementary Section S7 which showed
that FunFHMMer provides functional families that correspond well
with the manually curated SFLD families.

3.3.2 UniProtKB/SWiss-Prot rollback assessment

The PR graph in Figure 4 shows the performance of FunFams gener—
ated by FunFHMMer in predicting functions for the rollback assess—
ment compared with functions predicted by Pfam (native) families,
CDD families and DFX FunFams at different confidence score
thresholds ranging from 0 to 1. Pfam provides predictions for the
highest number of sequences (Coverage (C) : 86.5%) in the dataset
followed by DFX (C275.8%), CDD (C274.7%) and
FunFHMMer (C : 74%).

From Figure 4, we observe that all the methods perform competi—
tively. For predictions with high confidence scores (thresh—
olds > 0.95), Pfam (native) and DFX families i.e. broader groupings
of protein sequences can predict functions with higher precision
than CDD and FunFHMMer. However, for all other predictions
with lower confidence scores (thresholds < 0.95), CDD and
FunFHMMer perform better with respect to both precision and
recall. For this dataset, FunFHMMer gives the highest maximum
F—measure (FmaX:O.653) than the other family resources (CDD
FmX : 0.598; DFX FmX : 0.595; Pfam FmX : 0.581). The relative
performance of the methods was the same for hard targets of the as—
sessment i.e. those proteins which do not have any functionally
annotated relatives with sequence identity>50% (Supplementary
Section S5.4). FunFHMMer also shows better performance (higher
FmX value) in predicting protein functions compared with
DFX which confirms that, as expected, improved functional sub—
classification of CATH superfamilies also improves protein function
prediction and that the purity of the FunFams can have a significant
impact on their performance in functional annotation of
uncharacterized sequences.

3.4 Visualization of FunFam relationships within
superfamilies

superfamilies. We have developed a novel method (FunFHMMer)
for functional classification of these superfamilies. The aim of this
classification is manifold. For example, to improve our understand—
ing of the sequence and structure mechanisms of functional diver—
gence within a superfamily during evolution and to improve the
functional annotation of uncharacterized protein domain sequences
assigned to an annotated functional family within the superfamily.
To our knowledge no other such comprehensive functional classifi—
cation of domain sequences, linked to structural data, exists.

Here, we show that our novel functional classification protocol
has resulted in FunFams that are significantly more functionally
pure than in our previous classification reported in 2011 (DFX,
Rentzsch and Orengo, 2013). This was demonstrated using an as—
sessment protocol based on the EC classification and the manually
curated SFLD superfamilies. We also demonstrate that this
enhanced functional purity translates into better performance in
functional prediction for uncharacterized sequences using a
UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot rollback assessment.

FunFHMMer clearly generates more functionally pure families
than other domain—based resources and outperforms DFX in protein
function prediction as assessed by the UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot roll—
back assessment. Moreover, the performance of FunFHMMer in the
preliminary results of CAFA 2 (2013—2014) have been very encour—
aging. FunFHMMer, which only uses domain information, was fea—
tured among the top five among 110 automatic function prediction
methods (some of which use information from heterogenous data
sources for making predictions) in predicting biological process GO
terms and among the top 10 in predicting molecular function terms.
CAFA 2 results can be accessed from: https://github.com/idoerg/
CAFA2—results. The CAFA assessment protocol provides independ—
ent validation that the FunFams in CATH—Gene3D are of reasonable
functional purity and valuable for providing functional annotations
for novel, uncharacterized sequences.

CATH currently identifies 110 439 FunFams and for the most
populated of these (having high information content), accounting
for 72% of CATH—Gene3D sequences, residues implicated in func—
tional sites can be predicted. Our assessment of functional purity of
the FunFams has shown that our new families can be used to iden—
tify a higher proportion of known functional residues associated
with a particular functional grouping than our previous method
DFX. A web server has been set up to allow users to submit query
sequences for assignment to a CATH FunFam, where possible. The
server (http://www.cathdb.info/search/by_funfhmmer) takes a pro—
tein sequence in the FASTA format as input and scans it against the
CATH FunFam HMMs. The FunFam matches for the constituent
domains of the query sequence are reported when they achieve the
inclusion threshold score of the corresponding FunFam HMM.
Information on the highly conserved residues identified for those
CATH FunFams having MSAs with sufficient information content,
is also available on the CATH—Gene3D website (Lees et al., 2014;
Sillitoe et al., 2015 ). These positions are highlighted on a representa—
tive 3D—structure for the FunFam, where available.

We also provide network visualizations of the relationships be—
tween FunFams within each superfamily. These images provide
valuable insights into the functional diversity across a superfamily
and reveal where particular functions dominate the superfamily.
Therefore, CATH FunFams are useful for analysing the variation in
functions across a superfamily and since functional sites can be iden—
tified for many FunFams, they allow a structurally informed analysis
of the mechanisms of this divergence.

In summary, we have shown that a novel approach to sub—clas—
sifying FunFams in CATH—Gene3D, based on the difference in SDPs
between functional groups is able to separate FunFams exploiting
different conserved residues to perform their functional properties.
This approach provides a domain classification that is able to pro—
vide accurate functional annotations than broader groupings of
relatives.

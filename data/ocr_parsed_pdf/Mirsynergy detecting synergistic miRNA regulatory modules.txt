based on a non—parametric Bayesian prior called Indian Buffet
Process. Although GroupMiR is statistically sound, it has time
complexity cubic to the number of observations and converges
slow on large datasets (Grifﬁths and Ghahramani, 2005).

More recently, Zhang et a]. (2011) described a framework of
sparse network—regularized multiple non—negative matrix factor—
ization (SNMNMF) to identify miRNAimRNA modules based
on the factorized coefﬁcient matrices. Importantly, SNMNMF
uses not only the expression and target—site information but also
the geneigene interaction (GGI) derived from proteiniprotein
interaction (PPI) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS).
To deﬁne the reduced dimensionality of the factorized matrices,
however, the SNMNMF approach requires a predefined number
of modules, which may be data—dependent and difﬁcult to deter—
mine beforehand. Additionally, the solution to NMF is often not
unique, and the identified modules do not necessarily include
both miRNAs and mRNAs, which makes reproducing and in—
terpreting the results difﬁcult. Similarly, the regression—based
model called PIMiM (Protein Interaction—based MicroRNA
Modules) developed by Le and Bar—Joseph (2013) also requires
a ﬁxed number of unique memberships, and the non—convexity
of the algorithm leads to different outcomes with random
initializations. Additionally, both algorithms incur a time com—
plexity quadratic to both the number of miRNA and mRNA
multiplied by the (squared) total number of modules per iter—
ation. We herein hypothesize that an intuitively simple and effi—
cient deterministic framework may serve as an attractive
alternative.

In this article, we propose a novel model called Mirsynergy
that integrates m/miRNA expression profiles, target site infor—
mation and GGI to form MiRMs, where an m/miRNA may
participate in multiple MiRMs, and the module number is sys—
tematically determined given the predeﬁned model parameters.
The clustering algorithm of Mirsynergy adapts from
ClusterONE (Nepusz et al., 2012), which was intended to identify
protein complex from PPI data. The ultimate goal here, however,
is to construct a priori the MiRMs and exploit them to better
explain clinical outcomes such as patient survival rate. We apply
Mirsynergy to ovarian (OV), breast (BRCA) and thyroid cancer
(THCA) datasets from TCGA (Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, 2008). Comparing with alternative formalisms, we ﬁnd
that the Mirsynergy—based modules are more functionally en—
riched and exhibit more negative MiMEC. Through Kaplani
Meier (KM) survival analysis, we propose several prognostically
promising cancer—speciﬁc MiRMs as biomarkers.

2 METHODS

2.1 Mirsynergy model overview

We formulate the construction of synergistic MiRMs as an overlapping
clustering problem with two main stages. Figure 1 depicts our model
schema. Before the two clustering stages, we ﬁrst inferred miRNAi
mRNA interaction weights (MMIW) (W) using m/miRNA expression
data and target site information (Section 2.2). At stage 1, we only cluster
miRNAs to greedily maximize miRNAimiRNA synergy, which is pro-
portional to the correlation between miRNAs in terms of their MMIW
(See Section 2.2). At stage 2, we ﬁx the MiRM assignments and greedily
add (remove) genes to (from) each MiRM to maximize the synergy score,
which is deﬁned as a function of the MMIW matrix and the geneigene

gression model (i.e. LASSO). We then compute miRNAimiRNA syner-
gistic scores S based on the MMIW matrix, which is subsequently
provided as input to form miRNA clusters V0 at Stage 1 by an over-
lapping neighbourhood expansion clustering algorithm. Next, we ﬁx the
MiRM assignments V0 and greedily add (remove) mRNA to (from) each
module that maximizes the synergy score, where the edge weights are
deﬁned by the MMIW matrix and GGIW matrix involving known
TFBS and PPI. The end results are overlapping clustering assignments
of m/miRNAs (i.e., MiRMs)

rithm at both stages (Section 2.3) adapts from ClusterONE, which was
originally developed for PPI network (Nepusz et 01., 2012).

2.2 Evaluation of expression-based prediction models

To compute MMIW as the edge-weight matrix for downstream cluster-
ing, we ﬁrst evaluated four prominent expression-based miRNA target
prediction algorithms, namely Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (PCC)
(Zhang et 01., 2011), GenMiR+ + (Huang et 01., 2007) and two formu-
lations of LASSO (Lu et 01., 2011). Speciﬁcally, PCC between each pair
of m/miRNA across T samples was computed using R built-in function
cor. Targets with negative correlation were ranked at the top.
GenMiR+ + was ran in Matlab with default setting using as input the
binary target site matrix and the expression proﬁles. We implemented two
versions of LASSO both using glmnet with at = 1 except that the best A
was chosen using cross-validation function cv . glmnet (Friedman et 01.,
2010). For the ﬁrst LASSO, we used expression of miRNAs
k e {1, . . . , M} that have non-zero target sites to model the corresponding

target sites in mRNA 1' for miRNA k, WM. 6 WNxM is the ﬁtted linear
coefﬁcients used for the MMIW. For the second LASSO, namely
LASSO_RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), we used target site
counts, miRNA, and Ago 141 mRNA expression as the input variable:
X,»,,~w,;0 + 2A, wMAgozzk‘mi‘k + 2A, wgkAgol‘3‘4zk‘p The rationale behind
LASSO_RISC is that Ago2 is the only protein component known to
catalyse target mRNA degradation whereas the non-catalytic Ago 1,3,4
proteins may compete with Ago2 to bind to miRNAs; thus, the expres-
sion changes in the Ago 1, 3, 4 proteins will affect the ability of Ago2 to
bind to miRNAs (Lu et al., 2011). For LASSO and LASSO_RISC, inter-
actions associated with negative linear coefﬁcients wM. (i.e. MMIW) were
ranked at the top as the candidate interactions.

Because of the scarcity of the validated miRNA targets, conventional
power analysis such as ROC (receiver operating characteristic) cannot
distinguish the method performances. Instead, we assessed each method
by the number of validated interactions they identiﬁed among their top
ranked 100(P5000 targets (lOOO-interval) based on miRTarBase (Hsu
et al., 2011). Among the four methods, LASSO achieved the best overall
performance on our test data (Supplementary Fig. S1). Accordingly, we
adopted the linear coefﬁcient matrix WM» 6 W from LASSO as the N X M
MMIW matrix and set all of its positive coefﬁcients to zero, assuming
only negative miRNA regulation.

2.3 Two-stage clustering

Let W denote the expression-based N ><M MMIW matrix obtained
from LASSO, determined as the best performing target predic-
tion model in Section 2.2, where W‘in is the scoring weight for
miRNA k targeting mRNA 1'. Similar to the ‘Meet/Min’ score deﬁned
by Shalgi et a]. (2007) for binary interactions of co-occurring targets
of miRNA pairs, we define an M X M scoring matrix denoted as S,
indicating miRNAimiRNA synergistic scores between miRNA j and k

(1' 7'5 k):
N
Z wiJ-wi‘k
i=1
min  w”, 2 WM]

Notably, if W were a binary matrix, Equation I became the ratio of
number of targets shared between miRNA j and k over the minimum
number of targets possessed by j or k, which is essentially the original
‘Meet/Min’ score.

Similar to the cohesiveness deﬁned by Nepusz et a]. (2012), we deﬁne
synergy score s( Vi.) for any given MiRM V(. as follows. Let wi"( V6) denote
the total weights of the internal edges within the miRNA cluster,
w”‘”‘"d( V6) the total weights of the boundary edges connecting the
miRNAs within V(. to the miRNAs outside V6, and oz( Vi.) the penalty
scores for forming cluster V6. The synergy of V(. (i.e. the objective func-
tion) is as follows:

(1)

Sj‘k =

Wi"( Va)

A V6 : .—
Y( ) w’"(VC)+w””""‘1(VC)+a(VC)

(2)

where oz( Vi.) reﬂects our limited knowledge on potential unknown targets
of the added miRNAs as well as the false-positive targets within the
cluster. Presumably, these unknown factors will affect our decision on
whether miRNA k belong to cluster V(.. For instance, miRNAs may
target non-coding RNAs and seedless targets, which are the mRNAs
with no perfect seed-match (Helwak et al., 2013). We currently consider
only mRNA targets with seed-match to minimize the number of false-
positive results. By default, we set oz( V6) = 2| Vol, where |V(.| is the cardin-
ality of V6. Additionally, we deﬁne two scoring functions to assess the

overlap a)( V6, Vt») between V(. and V,» for c 75 c’ and the density dl(V(.) of
any given Vt:

IV. ﬂ ml
V6, V,» = — 3
M ) IVCIIVC/I U
2w” VL,
d1(V.)= —( ) (4)
m(m — l)

where |VC ﬂ Veil is the total number of common elements in V(. and VL»,
and m is the number of miRNAs in V6.

The general solution for solving an overlapping clustering problem is
Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) (Barthélemy and
Brucker, 2001). Thus, we adapt a greedy-based approach (Nepusz
et al., 2012). The algorithm can be divided into two major steps. In
step 1, we select as an initial seed miRNA k with the highest total weights.
We then grow an MiRM V, from seed k by iteratively including boundary
or excluding internal miRNAs to maximize the synergy s( V,) (Equation 2)
until no more node can be added or removed to improve s( V,). We then
pick another miRNA that has neither been considered as seed nor
included in any previously expanded V, to form V,+ 1. The entire process
terminates when all of the miRNAs are considered. In step 2, we treat the
clusters as a graph with V(. as nodes and w( V6, Vt») : r as edges. Here I is
a free parameter. Empirically, we observed that most MiRMs are quite
distinct from one another in terms of w( V6, Vt») (before the merging)
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Accordingly, we set I to 0.8 to ensure merging
only similar MiRMs, which avoids producing large MiRMs (when r is
too small). We then perform a breath-ﬁrst search to ﬁnd all of the weakly
connected components (CC), each containing clusters that can reach dir-
ectly/indirectly to one another within the CC. We merge all of the clusters
in the same CC and update the synergy score accordingly. Algorithm 1
outlines the pseudocode.

After forming MiRMs at stage 1, we perform a similar clustering pro-
cedure as in Algorithm 1 by adding (removing) only the mRNAs to (from)
each MiRM. Different from stage 1, however, we grow each existing
MiRM separately with no prioritized seed selection or cluster merging,
which allows us to implement a parallel computation by taking advantage
of the multicore processors in the modern computers. In growing/con-
tracting each MiRM, we maximize the same synergy function (Equation
2) but changing the edge weight matrix from S to a (N + A/I) X (N + A/I)
matrix by combining W (the N X M MMIW matrix) and H (the N X N
GGIW matrix). Notably, here we assume miRNAimiRNA edges to be
zero. Additionally, we do not add/remove miRNAs to/from the MiRM
at each greedy step. Finally, we deﬁne a new density function because of
the connectivity change at stage 2:

_ w’"(Vc)

d2( Va) ’ m (5)
where n (m) are the number of mRNAs (miRNAs) in V6. By default, we
ﬁlter out MiRMs with d1(V,»)< 1e—2 and d2(VJ-)< 5e—3 at stage 1 and 2,
respectively. Both density thresholds were chosen based on our empirical
analyses (Supplementary Fig. S2). For some datasets, in particular, we
found that our greedy approach tends to produce a large cluster involving
several hundred miRNAs or several thousand mRNAs at Stage 1 or 2,
respectively, which are unlikely to be biologically meaningful. Despite the
ever increasing synergy (by deﬁnition), however, the anomaly modules all
have low density scores, which allows us to filter them out using the
above chosen thresholds.

The time complexity of the algorithm is 0(M(N + M): stage 1 takes
0(M2) in the worst case scenario by checking every miRNA in forming
an MiRM using every miRNA as a seed; given that the maximum
number of MiRMs is M, stage 2 takes 0(le/I). In our actual implemen-
tation, the total weights of each node is pre-computed so that the synergy
update is 0(1). Moreover, we maintain a sorted list using numbers to
represent m/miRNA nodes for efﬁcient binary search of neighbour or
removable nodes.

2.4 Method comparisons

To compare the performance of Mirsynergy, we applied SNMNMF
(Zhang et al., 2011) to the same testing data. SNMNMF is one of the
most cited works in the recent literature and has been shown to outper-
form the MBE approach introduced earlier by Peng et a]. (2009).
SNMNMF was implemented in Matlab with source code available. As
suggested by the authors, we set the required module number to 50 and
used the default settings throughout the tests. Additionally, we also com-
pared our results (using the same test dataset) with the published results
from another recent algorithm called PIMiM developed by Le and Bar-
Joseph (2013), which was shown to outperform SNMNMF, but the soft-
ware is not publicly available.

2.5 Functional enrichment comparison

We examined whether the target genes in each MiRM are involved in
biologically meaningful Gene Ontology (GO) or pathways via functional
enrichment analysis. Speciﬁcally, GO terms in biological processes (BPs)
(GO-BPS) were downloaded using getBM function from R package
biomaRt, where GO terms with fewer than ﬁve genes or with evidence
codes equal to Electronic Annotation, Non-traceable Author Statement
or No biological Data available were discarded, giving 2007 GO-BP
terms and 10315 unique genes. The canonical pathways were down-
loaded from MSigDB (c2.cp.v4.0.symbols.gmt) (Subramanian et al.,
2005). The list of Ensembl gene IDs for each MiRM was then subjected

to hypergeometric enrichment test for each GO-BP term or pathways
using R built-in function phyper. The P-values were corrected for mul-
tiple testing by R function p . adjust to produce false discovery rates
(FDR).

2.6 Data collection and pre-processing

For the ﬁrst test dataset, we obtained the same ovarian cancer dataset
processed by the SNMNMF authors (Zhang et al., 2011). The expression
data from this dataset were originally downloaded from TCGA along
with the target site information from MicroCosm (v5) and GGI from
TRANSFAC (Wingender et al., 2000). The expression dataset contains
385 samples, each measuring 559 miRNAs and 12456 mRNAs. For the
second and third test datasets, we downloaded the expression data for
BRCA and THCA from TCGA data portal. The BRCA and THCA data
contain 331 and 543 samples, respectively, each measuring 710 miRNAs
and 13 306 mRNAs. For both datasets, processed (level 3) RNA-seq(V 2)
and miRNA-seq data were used, which record the RPKM (read per
kilobase of exon per million mapped reads) values for mRNAs and
RPM (reads per million miRNAs mapped) for miRNAs. The data
were further log2-transformed and mean-centred. Clinical information
for OV, BRCA and THCA were also collected from TCGA.

For the BRCA and THCA, we used target site information from
TargetScanHuman 6.2 database (Friedman et al., 2009). For each
mRNAimiRNA pair that have measured expression in TCGA data,
we extracted the corresponding conserved target sites. For multiple tran-
scripts of the same gene, we used transcripts with the longest 3’UTR.
GGI data matrix H including TFBS and PPI data were processed from
TRANSFAC (Wingender et al., 2000) and BioGrid (Stark et al., 2011)
databases, respectively. Cancer-related miRNAs as oncomirs or tumour
suppressors (i.e. miRNAs highly or lowly expressed in cancers) were
downloaded from Spizzo et a]. (2009) and Koturbash et a]. (2011)
Tables 1 and 2, where 97 oncomirs have measured expression in the
TCGA data.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Comparison of module sizes and connectivities

Mirsynergy identiﬁed 84, 53, 50 MiRMs in OV, BRCA and
THCA datasets, respectively (Table 1, Supplementary Table
S1). Intriguingly, the overall synergy landscapes are distinct for
each cancer type at both clustering stages (Supplementary Fig.
S3). Comparing with the MiRMs from SNMNMF, however, the
modules identiﬁed by Mirsynergy are clearly more densely con—
nected within and between MiRMs (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs
S4, S5), which are comparable with the module density asso—
ciated with PIMiM—MiRMs (on the same OV dataset) (Le and
Bar—Joseph, 2013) and perhaps more consistent with the intricacy
of the underlying biological network. Moreover, Mirsynergy
identiﬁed more modules (84, 53, 50) than SNMNMF did (49,
39, 39) for OV, BRCA and THCA, respectively (Table 1).
Notably, although we set K = 50 for SNMNMF, some modules
were empty and thus discarded by the algorithm. For OV,
BRCA and THCA datasets, the respective averaged number of
miRNAs (genes) per module are 4.76, 5.77, 7.60 (7.57, 24.15,
32.26) for Mirsynergy and 4.12, 2.62, 2.23 (81.37, 71.56, 74.82)
for SNMNMF (Table 1). For the BRCA and THCA datasets, 8/
39 modules from SNMNMF have only one miRNA (i.e. ‘star—
shape’ basic network structure) and 20/ 39 modules have less than
three miRNAs. In contrast, all of the modules from Mirsynergy
have more than one miRNA, and most modules have at least

cluster. A recently developed greedy—based clustering method
ClusterONE is more realistic because it allows overlap between
clusters (Nepusz et al., 2012). However, ClusterONE was de—
veloped with physical PPI in mind. Mirsynergy extends from
ClusterONE to detecting MiRMs. The novelty of our approach
resides in a two—stage clustering strategy with each stage max—
imizing a synergy score as a function of either the miRNA—
miRNA synergistic co—regulation or miRNAimRNA/genei
gene interactions. Several methods have incorporated GGI as
PPI/TFBS in predicting MiRMs (Le and Bar—Joseph, 2013;
Zhang et al., 2011), which proved to be a more accurate ap—
proach than using miRNA—mRNA alone. Comparing with
recent methods such as SNMNMF (Zhang et al., 2011) and
PIMiM (Le and Bar—Joseph, 2013), however, an advantage of
our deterministic formalism is the automatic determination of
module number (given the predeﬁned thresholds to merge and
ﬁlter low quality clusters) and efﬁcient computation with theor—
etical bound reduced from 0(K(T + N + M)2) per iteration to
only 0(M(N + M)) for N (114) mRNAs (miRNAs) across T sam—
ples. Because N is usually much larger than M and T, our algo—
rithm runs orders of faster. Based on our tests on a linux server,
Mirsynergy took about 2 h including the run time for LASSO to
compute OV (N = 12 456; M = 559; T= 385), BRCA or THCA
(N = 13306; M = 710; T = 331 or 543, respectively), whereas
SNMNMF took more than a day for each dataset. More im—
portantly, Mirsynergy—MiRMs are signiﬁcantly more function—
ally enriched, coherently expressed and thus more likely to be
biologically functional.

The success of our model is likely attributable to its ability to
explicitly leverage two types of information at each clustering
stage: (i) the miRNAimiRNA synergism based on the correl—
ation of the inferred miRNA target score proﬁles from
MMIW matrix; (ii) the combinatorial miRNA regulatory effects
on existing genetic network, implicated in the combined MMIW
and GGIW matrices. We also explored other model formulations
such as clustering m/miRNAs in a single clustering stage or using
different MMIW matrices other than the one produced from
LASSO, which tends to produce MiRMs each containing only
one or a few miRNAs or several large low—quality MiRMs,
which were then filtered out by the density threshold in either
clustering stage. Notably, an MiRM containing only a single
miRNA can be directly derived from the MMIW without any
clustering approach. Moreover, Mirsynergy considers only
neighbour nodes with non—zero edges. Thus, our model works
the best on a sparse MMIW matrix such as the outputs from
LASSO, which is the best performing expression—based methods
based on our comparison with other alternatives. Nonetheless,
the performance of Mirsynergy is sensitive to the quality of
MMIW and GGIW. In this regard, other MMIW or GGIW
matrices (generated from improved methods) can be easily incor—
porated into Mirsynergy as the function parameters by the users
of the Bioconductor package (please refer to the package vignette
for more details). In conclusion, with large amount of m/miRNA
expression data becoming available, we believe that Mirsynergy
will serve as a powerful tool for analysing condition—specific
miRNA regulatory networks.

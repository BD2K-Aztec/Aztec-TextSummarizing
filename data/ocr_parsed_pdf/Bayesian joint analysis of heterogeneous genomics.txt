ABSTRACT

Summary: A non-parametric Bayesian factor model is proposed for
joint analysis of multi-platform genomics data. The approach is based
on factorizing the latent space (feature space) into a shared compo-
nent and a data-specific component with the dimensionality of these
components (spaces) inferred via a beta-Bernoulli process. The pro-
posed approach is demonstrated by jointly analyzing gene expression/
copy number variations and gene expression/methylation data for
ovarian cancer patients, showing that the proposed model can poten-
tially uncover key drivers related to cancer.

Availability and implementation: The source code for this model is
written in MATLAB and has been made publicly available at https://

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene expression proﬁles are commonly used in the study of
cancer biology (Garber et al., 2001). However, human cancers
are highly heterogeneous because of the combined effects of
genetic instabilities and epigenetic alterations. Hence, it is notori-
ously difﬁcult to gain understanding of the mechanisms of cancer
progression from gene expression data alone. The root cause of
cancer is due to several possible events. For instance, copy
number variations (CNVs) under selective pressure change the
dosage of key tumor-inducing and tumor-suppressing genes,
which thereby affect mRNA transcription and neoplastic cell
proliferation (Tang et al., 2012). On the other hand, the mech-
anism of epigenetic alteration is more complicated. DNA methy-
lation patterns are globally disrupted in tumor cells,
characterized by both global hypomethylation and region-
speciﬁc hypermethylation at CpG islands (Robertson, 2001).
There is a recent explosion in the availability of cancer datasets
of multiple heterogeneous data types from sources like the
Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA; cancergenome.nih.gov).
It is hoped that the availability of simultaneous measurements of

multiple biological features such as gene expression, DNA copy
number change, DNA methylation and others will offer an
increased insight into the root causes of cancer phenotypes.
These insights have the potential to distinguish genetic/epigenetic
changes that promote cancer progression (driver mutation) from
those with no selective advantage (passenger mutation) (AkaVia
et al., 2010), which could revolutionize the treatment of cancer by
suggesting novel targets for cancer therapeutics and by develop-
ing biomarkers to identify the patients who will most beneﬁt
from such therapeutics (Li et al., 2009).

There are numerous publications on combining different types
of DNA modiﬁcations with gene expression. Perhaps the most
natural of these are the brute force methods such as expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis (Kendziorski et al., 2006).
Joint analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data
with gene expression data by expression quantitative trait loci
involves testing every gene-single nucleotide polymorphism pair
for association with a t—test, and then correcting for multiple
hypothesis testing. CNAmet (Louhimo and Hautaniemi, 2011)
deﬁnes a similar approach to relate gene expression changes with
either copy number change or DNA methylation. Other
approaches use well-established models for each of the individual
data types, and then combine the results into a statistic that
addresses the problem of interest. The approach of Jeong et al.
(2010) is an example of this for the identification of genes that are
regulated by DNA methylation. A shortcoming of all of these
approaches is that they do not reduce the dimension of the in-
dividual datasets through an accounting of their respective cor-
relation structures.

In Lanckriet et a]. (2004), the authors used kernel functions
predeﬁned for each data type, and mapped to the same vector
space, which allows joint analysis in the common range of the
kernels. Copy number and expression in cancer (AkaVia et al.,
2010) has been proposed as a Bayesian scoring function that
measures how well a set of candidate gene regulators correlates
with the expression of gene modules (groups of genes that are
correlated with each other). Another approach (Lucas et al.,
2010) uses a sparse factor (SF) model to describe the correlation
structure of the gene expression data but uses post hoc hypothesis
tests to draw connections between gene expression and copy
number data. These approaches allow for effective dimension
reduction but do not use correlation structure in one dataset to
inform the estimations of correlation in the others. Zheng and
Lucas (2012) extended this approach by the development of a
two-SF model using aneuploidy and gene expression as an ex-
ample. It assumes some factors are shared by two data where

Heterogeneous genomics data

 

there is a statistical correlation, and some factors are unique to
each dataset. The common factors are further linked by sampling
gene expression factors centered on the CNV factors with some
Gaussian noise, thereby preventing the difference in data size
from overwhelming the information available on associations
between them. However, it is difﬁcult to check model assump-
tions in high-dimension by specifying different numbers of
factors.

In the recent years, model-based integration approach has
become popular for analyzing TCGA data. Xu et a]. (2012)
proposed a three-node Bayesian graphical model to represent
the dependence structure of CNVs, methylation and gene expres-
sion. This method identifies the mRNA regulatory event separ-
ately for each candidate gene but does not consider gene modules
as a whole. iBAG (Jennings et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013)
speciﬁes gene-methylation effect and other regulatory module
controlled effect and then uses a two-component regression
model to identify gene/biomarkers that are associated with clin-
ical outcomes (e.g. survival time, tumor stage and other demo-
graphic variables). In this way, it assumes linear and independent
effects between gene expression and methylation as well as pa-
tient survival and gene expression. However, given the complex-
ity of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, more ﬂexible Bayesian
non-parametric models may be preferred.

For jointly modeling heterogeneous data, Bayesian and semi-
Bayesian latent variable models have been developed to factorize
the latent space into a shared and data-speciﬁc part
(Archambeau and Bach, 2008; Klami and Kaski, 2008).
However, in these approaches the number of latent factors is
chosen a priori. Alternatively, one may consider multiple factor
models, each with a different number of factors, and perform
model selection based on information criteria such as Akaike
information criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1987) or Bayesian informa-
tion criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978). However, as stated earlier,
it is often challenging to check modeling assumptions in high-
dimensions. Hence, a non-parametric or semiparametric model is
desirable.

In this article, we propose a non-parametric Bayesian factor
analysis approach for integrating heterogeneous genomics data,
with the number of factors inferred from the available data. Our
proposed approach is based on factoring the latent space into
shared and data-speciﬁc components, using a beta-Bernoulli pro-
cess (Grifﬁths and Ghahramani, 2005; Paisley and Carin, 2009;
Thibaux and Jordan, 2007) to infer the dimension of these latent
spaces. We demonstrate the proposed approach on the joint ana-
lysis of genomics data for ovarian cancer patients, including
three different data types: gene expression, CNV and DNA
methylation data. We demonstrate that the joint analysis of
gene expression/CNV and gene expression/DNA methylation
levels can potentially identify genomic and epigenomic regulators
inﬂuencing cancer pathophysiology outcomes.

The remainder of the article is organized as follows. In Section
2, we present the proposed hierarchical Bayesian model for
jointly analyzing heterogeneous genomics data. In Section 3,
we discuss priors on factor loadings and factor scores. Section
4 outlines an MCMC inference algorithm. Section 5 provides
experimental results for the proposed model on the analysis of
multiple genomics data. Finally, we provide concluding remarks
in Section 6.

2 JOINT BAYESIAN FACTOR ANALYSIS
Let {X(")}r:L R represent data from R different modalities, where

X“) = (xi'l), ...,x33) 6 IRN'XM. Here N, represents the dimen-
sionality of the observation vectors of modality r (e.g. the total
number of genes) and M represents the total number of samples,
e. g. patients. In SF modeling, learning a single shared matrix of
factor loadings for different signal classes has been proposed in
Mairal et a]. (2008). However, for heterogeneous data such as
that considered here, learning a shared set of factor loadings is
more difﬁcult.
The joint factor model may be represented as

X“) = D(")(W(c) + W“) + E“) (1)

The matrix D“) 2 (dir), . . . , d?) e IRN'XK consists of the factor
loadings speciﬁc to data modality r, factor scores W") 2

(war), ...,wgg) e IRKXM are speciﬁc to data from modality r,
W“) = (wic), ..., WE?) e IRKXM consists of the factor scores

common among all modalities and E") 2 (6(11‘), . . . , 63(2) 6
IRN'XM consists of the noise/residual speciﬁc to data of modality r.
Note that one may alternatively consider

X“) 2 D“) W“) + D“) W") + E") (2)

where D“) corresponds to factor loadings associated with
common factors, with DOT) reﬂective of how these common fac-
tors are Viewed by modality V; D“) are factor loadings associated
with factors speciﬁc only to modality r. The framework in (1),
which we use throughout, allows the ability to share factor load-
ings between the common and modality-specific factors, and the
manner in which W“) and W") are modeled allows sufﬁcient
ﬂexibility to yield (2) if the data so warrant.

We wish to impose the condition that any x5") is a sparse linear
combination of the factor loadings. Hence, the factor scores are
represented as,

wgw 2 s50 (9 by? and we 2 s50 (9 b9 (3)

where s5") 6 IRK, s?) e IRK, 11;") e {0, 1}K, b?) e {0, 1}K and 0
represents the Hadamard product (element-wise vector product).
The sparse binary vectors by) are drawn from the following beta-
Bernoulli process (Grifﬁths and Ghahramani, 2005; Paisley and
Carin, 2009; Thibaux and Jordan, 2007)

K K
b5") ~ n Bernoulli(7rk), 71 ~ n Beta(ca, c(1 — a» (4)
k=l k=l

with 71k representing the kth component of 71 and a e (0, 1). In
practice K is ﬁnite, and the above equation represents a ﬁnite
approximation to the beta-Bernoulli process, where the number
of non-zero components of each by) is a random variable drawn
from Binomial(K,a). If a is set to f; in the limit K —> 00 this
reduces to the number of non-zero components in by.) being
drawn from Poisson(p); this corresponds to the Indian buffet
process (IBP) (Griffiths and Ghahramani, 2005; Paisley and
Carin, 2009; Thibaux and Jordan, 2007). Therefore, we may
explicitly impose a prior belief on the number of non-zero
components in W)”. The shared binary vectors by) are modeled
similarly as b5").

The properties of the beta process induce sparsity in the fea-
ture space by encouraging sharing of features. An example of a
binary feature matrix drawn from a beta-Bernoulli process is
shown in Figure 1. If K is set to a relatively large value, the
ﬁnite beta-Bernoulli process allows inference of the number of
factors needed to represent the data. Conceptually, in a finite
beta-Bernoulli process, we start with a large number of param-
eters (instead of an inﬁnite number of parameters, as done in an
IBP), and then allow the data to infer the appropriate (low-
dimensional) model order during posterior inference. In princi-
ple, one might desire to actually treat the model as inﬁnite within
inference; however, Paisley and Carin (2009) show that the ﬁnite
approximation of the beta-Bernoulli process, for large K, yields a
very accurate approximation to the IBP, and hence we anticipate
little, if any, change in results for an inﬁnite model from those
obtained in this article.

The noise or residual in (1) is modeled as

a?) ~N(o,y:">*‘IN.), Vi") ~ Gamma(a0,bo) (5)

where IN, represents the N,. x N,. identity matrix.

The construction in (1) imposes the belief that there are under-
lying (low-dimensional) features represented by the factor scores
that may be shared across modalities, Via W“); however, each
modality has a unique mapping from these low-dimensional
factor scores to the high-dimensional data, reﬂected by D“).
Further, each modality may also have idiosyncratic low-dimen-
sional features, characterized by W"). The common and idiosyn-
cratic features are learned jointly, Via the simultaneous analysis
of all modalities. A unique feature of the above construction is
that it allows complete sharing of some low-dimensional features
across different data modalities as well as partial sharing, i.e. a
shared feature may be slightly perturbed Via W“) and shared
across different modalities.

3 MODEL CONSTRUCTION

3.1 Priors for factor loadings and factor scores

In the absence of covariates, the factor loadings may be drawn
i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) from a Gaussian
distribution (for ease of notation, we henceforth drop the mo-
dality index r, unless referring to multiple data modalities
simultaneously),

dk ~ N(0, ys’lIN), y, ~ Gamma(a5,b5) (6)

One may impose covariate-dependent factor loadings [e.g.
factor loadings drawn from a Gaussian process or a mixture of
Gaussian processes (Gramacy and Lee, 2007; Meeds and
Osindero, 2006; Rasmussen and Ghahramani, 2002; Ray and
Carin, 2011; Tresp, 2001)] or an additional Markov structure
(Fox et al., 2008) on the factor loadings to impose the correl-
ation. However, for the genomics data considered in this article,
it was deemed unnecessary to impose such structures.

The factor scores may be drawn i.i.d. (independent and iden-
tically distributed) from a Gaussian distribution as,

matrix have been reordered from top to bottom by the magnitude of
the binary number expressed by that row, taking the rightmost column
as the most signiﬁcant bit. It can be observed that the prior favors sharing
of features, with some dominant features shared by many observations
and a few features that are possessed by only a few observations

We impose broad gamma prior on y,. and yc:
yr ~ Gamma(a2, b2) and yc ~ Gamma(a3, b3).

3.2 Imposing sparsity

In many biological applications, such as those considered in this
article, it is desirable that the factor loading matrix is sparse
(Carvalho et al., 2008). To impose sparsity on the factor load-
ings, we use a Student-t sparseness-promoting prior (Tipping,
2001). In this construction,  , the jth component of dk, is drawn

rjk ~ Gamma(a1, b1) (9)

However, there are multiple ways by which one may desire to
impose sparsity, such as using the spike-slab prior (Carvalho
et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2011; Ishwaran and Rao, 2005). This
consists of a discrete-continuous mixture of a point mass at zero,
referred to as the ‘spike’, and any other distribution, such as the
Gaussian distribution, known as the ‘slab’. A hierarchical beta-
Bernoulli construction of the spike-slab prior for imposing spars-
ity on the factor loadings is provided in Chen et a]. (2011). We
found that the spike-slab prior works as well as the model pre-
sented above; however, for the sake of brevity, we include only
the results for the Student-t sparseness prior in this article. Note
that for modeling the heterogeneous genomic data considered in
this article, we have this imposed sparsity both on the factor
loadings (Via a student-t sparseness-promoting prior) and on
the factor scores (Via a beta-Bernoulli process).

4 MCMC INFERENCE

The conditional posterior distribution of all the model param-
eters for the joint factor model may be derived analytically. We
use a Gibbs sampler to draw samples from the posterior distri-
bution of the model parameters. The number of Gibbs burn-in
samples is set to 3000 and the number of collection samples is set

to 1000. Broad gamma hyper priors are chosen for the variance
terms with a0 2 b0 2 a2 2 b2 2 a3 2 b3 2 10’s. The results are
relatively insensitive to these settings, and various other settings
such as a0=b0=a2=b2=a3=b3 21073 01‘ a0=b0=
a2 2 b2 2 a3 2 b3 2 10’6 yielded very similar results. The
shrinkage parameters on the factor loadings are set at
a1 = 10’3 and bl = 10’6 (for gene-copy number analysis) and
a1 = 1 and bl = 10’2 (for gene-methylation analysis). The shape
parameters on the beta-Bernoulli process are set as follows:
(i) for gene-copy number analysis, the common and data-speciﬁc
factors have the same hyperparameters, c = 400, a = 2.5e — 9;
(ii) for gene-methylation analysis, the hyper priors on the
common factors are c = 700, a = 1.5e — 4, on the gene-expres-
sion-speciﬁc factors are c = 500, a 2 2e — 4 and on the methy-
lation-specific factors are c = 10, a = 0.01.

The mixing of the MCMC sampler was also carefully exam-
ined. The sampler was run extensively for different number of
burn-in and collection samples. It was also run multiple times in
parallel with different initial values. The results of these experi-
ments were found to be consistent and repeatable across such
runs. Details of the Gibbs update equations are provided in the
Supplementary Material.

5 JOINT ANALYSIS OF HETEROGENEOUS
GENOMICS DATA

5.1 Data description

The data in this study include ovarian cancer gene expression,
CNVs and methylation data collected from TCGA project. We
aim to integrate gene expression/CNVs and gene expression/
methylation from 74 ovarian cancer patients. For computing
purposes, we downsized the original massive data into smaller
sets. Independent gene-by- gene filtering (based on criteria such as
overall mean and overall variance) is typically used to reduce
data dimension as well as increase the number of discoveries in
high-throughput experiments (Bourgon et al., 2010; Gentleman
et al., 2005; Talloen et al., 2007). In our analysis, a ﬁltering cri-
terion was established for the gene expression data (Affymetrix
HT_HGU133A) to eliminate probes with sample mean <6 or SD
<0.4, which resulted in a gene expression dataset downsized from
22 277 to 5976. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data
were filtered to remove Agilent Human Genome CGH 244A
probes containing missing values. This set was further ﬁltered
by keeping only one in 50 probes, leaving 4443 probes.
Methylation data (Illumina Inﬁnium human methylation 27K
bead assay) was filtered to retain only higher variance samples
(resulting in 4722 probes) and was inverse-probit transformed to
lie on the real line.

5.2 Analysis of gene expression and CNVs data

We applied the joint Bayesian factor model to gene expression
and CGH to identify the factors that are representative of corre-
lated changes in gene expression and DNA CNVs. We set the
upper bound on the number of factors as K = 60 and obtained 1
speciﬁc to gene expression, 4 unique to CNVs and 19 shared
between both modalities (Fig. 2). The results are relatively in-
sensitive to the choice of K, and various other choices yielded

and shared between gene expressions and CNVs, respectively. The y-axis
is the indicator of each factor, and x-axis represents the 74 subjects. The
inferred factors and samples selected by the model are assigned as 1
(white) and 0 (black) otherwise. Results are shown for the maximum-
likelihood collection sample (for illustration purposes)

similar results. Figure 3 shows the correlation structure of the
probe sets (gene expression) and CGH clones (CNVs) that are
included in joint factor number 41 (the factor numbering is ar-
bitrary, and changes between collection samples, with these re-
sults illustrative; in these and related results we depict the
maximum likelihood collection sample). As expected, correlation
between the factor genes for those patients who were included in
this factor is higher than for those not included.

It is well known that some variations in cancer gene expression
are caused by gene dosage changes because of CNVs. In add-
ition, because of the mechanism by which CNV occurs, it tends
to happen in contiguous regions. Of the 19 CNV factors identi-
ﬁed, one is a nearly perfect representation of batch effects in the
data and the remaining 18 display copy number ampliﬁcation/
deletion in speciﬁc chromosomal regions. Most of these show
similar gene expression changes in the same region. We demon-
strate this behavior in Figure 4, which shows that the largest
factor loadings from both CNV and gene expression for factor
18 are clustered around the same region of chromosome 8.

We identiﬁed highly associated CNVs in the chromosomal
arm 8q12.}8q24.13 (factor 18), which is a known region for
frequent high-level ampliﬁcation associated with disease progres-
sion in human cancers (Frank et al., 2007; Pils et al., 2005). The
rediscovery of genes in this region also validates our approach.
For example, E2F5 (8q21.2, Unique ID: 1875), an important
gene in the regulation of cell cycle, is known to be overexpressed
in ovarian epithelial cancer (Kothandaraman et al., 2010).
Overexpressed genes, MTDH (8q22.1, Unique ID: 92140) and
EBAG9 (8q23, Unique ID: 9166), have been recognized in a
variety of cancers including ovarian and breast cancers

These results are for the maximum-likelihood collection sample, for ease

inferred. The gray denotes odd-numbered chromosomes and the black
denotes even-numbered chromosomes

Another gene in this region whose expression level is known to
be important in tumor biology is WWPl (8q21, Unique ID:
11059). This recapitulation of some of the well-known features
of aneuploidy in cancer suggests that our joint model is appro-
priately capturing correlation structure between gene expression
and CGH data.

As described above, many factors we obtained are associated
with individual chromosomal locations, as demonstrated in
Figure 4. However, there is also a subset of factors that are rep-
resentative of multiple regions. Figure 5 shows that the largest
factor loadings in CNV/ gene expression for factor 41 come from
both chromosomes 6 and 17. This is the explanation of the

checkerboard regions of positive and negative correlation in
Figure 3 as well. The CNVs from the top-ranked CGH probes
in the two locations are highly negatively correlated, with copy
number gain in chromosome 6 and loss in the other. There are a
number of possible mechanistic explanations for this feature. For
example, it is possible that wholesale duplication of one region is
lethal to the cells without shutting down the apoptosis pathway.
Such a shut down might be accomplished by deletion of other
regions. Previous approaches to the joint analysis of gene expres-
sion and CNV through the use of factor models, such as Lucas
et al. (2010), have failed to ﬁnd these relationships.

The proposed joint factor model provides the ﬂexibility of
discovering factors that are relevant only for a subset of the
subjects. It is interesting to note that a similar model, which
enforces that all subjects are included in the inferred factors,
performed poorly compared with the proposed model and dis-
covered fewer factors that captured correlated changes in gene
expression and CNVs.

5.3 Analysis of gene expression and DNA methylation
data

For computational purpose, we selected probes with highest vari-
ances across samples and obtained top 1000 probes for both gene
expression and methylation. Eighteen common factors were thus
obtained. Unlike CNVs, methylation does not typically occur in
contiguous regions; therefore, it is not surprising that no regional
peaks were detected. Methylation acts as an epigenetic regulator
and silences tumor suppressor genes by changing chromosomal
structures. We detected a gene, SPONl (11p15.2, Unique ID:
10418), which appears to be predominantly regulated by methy-
lation of its CpG site (Fig. 6). Elevated expression of this gene
relative to normal tissue is a known hallmark of ovarian cancer
(Pyle-Chenault et al., 2005); however, the mechanism of this
overexpression was previously unknown. SPONl encodes
VSGP/F-spondin protein promoting proliferation in vascular
smooth cell during ovarian folliculogenesis, which has been iden-
tiﬁed as a potential diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for

Fig. 7. Loadings from factor 12 with strong correlations between methy-
lation (A) and gene expression (B) at many different loci. The gray de-
notes odd-numbered chromosomes and the black denotes even-numbered
chromosomes. Diamond markers denote loci where the absolute value of
loadings are >05, and gene expressions are signiﬁcantly associated with
adjacent methylation sites, detailed in Supplementary Table S4

ovarian carcinoma (Miyamoto et al., 2001; Pyle-Chenault et al.,
2005).

In contrast to the almost single gene precision of factor 5,
factor 12 shows strong correlation between methylation
and gene expression in many different loci on X chromosome
(Fig. 7, Supplementary Table S4). The list of CpG sites heavily
loaded on this factor is displayed in Supplementary Table S4.
Pathway analysis on these candidate genes (Fig. 7A) reveals that
many are involved in the regulation of transcription. They may
regulate the expression of XIST (Fig. 7B), the dysregulation of
which has been found in several cancers (Huang et al., 2002;
Sirchia et al., 2009). The correlation of methylation levels at all
of these sites combined with their correlated gene expression
levels suggests that they might all be the targets of a single methy-
lation program; however, the existence of coordinated methyla-
tion enzymes that target these locations is unconﬁrmed.

We implemented the joint factor model for analysis of multiple
genomics data in non-optimized Matlab on a quad core PC with
2.2GHz CPU and 4 GB ram. The average time per iteration of
the Gibbs sampler for the results in Section 5.2 is 72 s and for the
results in Section 5.3 is 55 s.

6 CONCLUSION

A non-parametric joint factor analysis method is introduced for
modeling multiple disparate but statistically related data. The
proposed approach was demonstrated on the joint analysis of
heterogeneous genomics data related to ovarian cancer. The pro-
posed model uncovered key drivers of cancer, some of which
have been previously reported in literature as well as some new
genomic causes of cancer (potentially).

In this article, we have focused on integrating multiple hetero-
geneous but statistically correlated datasets, Via a joint factor
analysis approach, where the latent space is factorized into a
shared component and data-speciﬁc components. The joint
factor analysis model allows enough ﬂexibility to incorporate
additional information into the model. For example, we could
alternatively use a Gaussian process prior or a Sticky-HMM
prior (Du et al., 2010) on the loadings of CNVs to incorporate
spacial-dependence structure in the model. Hence, more reﬁned
regional peaks may be recovered. We plan to investigate such
priors in our future work. Besides, we assume data-speciﬁc linear
mappings between the latent space and the observation space.
However, the assumption that the data lie in or close to a low-
dimensional subspace is restrictive and a better assumption is
that the data lie on a manifold. In the future, we wish to relax
the linearity assumption of our joint factor model Via a mixture
of factor analyzers approach.

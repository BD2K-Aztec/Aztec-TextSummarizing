either provide a fast—solving algorithm for the Bayesian model
or assume different priors (Stingo et al., 2010; Su et al., 2011).
The methods in all three categories have improved prediction
speciﬁcity by combining expression profile data with sequence—
based prediction (Muniategui et al., 2012b). However, expres—
sion datasets are in general limited in size. To address this limi—
tation, most existing methods concatenate expression proﬁles
from multiple diseases into one single dataset for analysis
(called ‘simple aggregate analysis’ in the rest of this article).
The advantages of this approach include the relatively large
sample size achieved and the high variability of expression in
genes and miRNAs among samples because of sample hetero—
geneity among diseases (which is preferred in interaction stu—
dies) through aggregation. However, the presence of disease
heterogeneity may dilute interaction signals if the association
is only present in one disease, and there are also challenges in
data processing and selection (Liu et al., 2009). Overall, studies
based on samples from one specific disease may be more pre—
ferred if sufﬁcient samples are available.

Recent releases of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) expres—
sion datasets on multiple tumors, such as ovarian serous cysta—
denocarcinoma (OV) (The Cancer Genome Atlas Network,
2011), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (The Cancer Genome
Atlas Research Network, 2008) and breast invasive carcinoma
(BRCA) (The Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012), provide
the opportunity to study miRNAigene interactions individually
in each cancer. Large sample size (usually >200 samples), het—
erogeneity among patient samples and high variability of gene/
miRNA expression in these cancers may significantly improve
statistical power to infer miRNAigene interactions. The existing
simple aggregate methods mentioned earlier in the text (e.g.
Pearson correlation, Lasso and GenMir++) can be used to ana—
lyze miRNAigene interactions in individual cancers in the
TCGA datasets. However, if a large number of miRNAigene
interactions are shared between different cancers, potentially
useful information may be lost in cancer—speciﬁc analysis when
interactions are weak in some of these cancers. The existing
methods may suffer from signal dilution and non—speciﬁc predic—
tion when used at aggregated datasets; on the other hand, these
methods may miss interactions shared among diseases if applied
to individual cancers. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a
method that can identify both disease—speciﬁc and common
interacting miRNAigene pairs through joint analysis of multiple
cancers.

In other areas of computational biology, statistical methods
have been developed for joint analysis of multiple—related data—
sets. In the joint analysis of multiple ChIPwhip datasets, Datta
and Zhao (2008) proposed a log—linear model to infer coopera—
tive binding among transcription factors. Ferguson et a]. (2012)
applied a quadratic regression model to jointly analyze multiple
ChIP—seq libraries with consideration of the potential covariates
in the data. Choi et a]. (2009) developed a hierarchical hidden
Markov model to incorporate data from both ChIP—seq and
ChIPichip data to improve the identifications of transcription
factor binding sites. Chen et a]. (2011) described a deterministic
model—based method (MM—ChIP) to perform meta—analysis by
integrating information from cross—platform and between—
laboratory ChIPichip or ChIP—seq data. Choi et a]. (2013) pre—
sented sparsely correlated hidden Markov models to analyze

multiple genome—wide location study datasets based on simultan—
eous hidden Markov model (HMM) inference. In gene regula—
tory network studies, Anvar et a]. (2011) proposed a novel
algorithm to infer interspecies disease networks based on the
construction and training of intraspecies Bayesian networks to
enhance the inference of gene network. Steele and Tucker (2008)
applied post—learning aggregation methods to study the regula—
tory networks by combining multiple microarray datasets with
consensus or meta—analysis Bayesian networks and to improve
the inference compared with simple concatenation of datasets.
Several meta—analyses of genome—wide association studies have
been performed to increase the power of disease—related variant
detections (De Jager et al., 2009; Ferrucci et al., 2009; Soranzo
et al., 2009).

In this article, we developed a two—stage method (called
MCMG, joint analysis of Multiple Cancers for MicroRNAi
Gene interactions) to identify miRNAigene interactions that
are either speciﬁc to a cancer type or common to several cancers
by jointly analyzing expression proﬁles from multiple cancers.
The probability of interactions is first inferred individually in
each cancer from paired miRNA and gene expression data and
then jointly analyzed across cancers through an empirical Bayes
model. Because of information sharing among different but
related cancers, better characterization of miRNAigene pairs
can be achieved compared with single cancer analysis or simple
aggregate analysis. Through both simulation studies and the ana—
lyses of TCGA datasets, we demonstrate the usefulness and
power of our method. In addition, our method can also infer
relationships among cancers and incorporate different data types
shown in real data analysis.

2 METHODS

2.1 Inference of miRNA—gene interactions

To facilitate the characterization of both common and speciﬁc
miRNAigene interactions in multiple cancers, we developed a two-
stage method for more accurate inference of interactions by borrow-
ing information shared among related cancers. In the ﬁrst stage, the
probabilities of miRNAigene interactions are calculated with the
Pearson correlation and local false discovery rate estimation individu-
ally in each cancer. In the second stage, we use an empirical Bayes
method to jointly infer the posterior probability of interactions across
cancers.

2.1.1 Inference of within—cancer pairs probability Various meth-
ods, such as correlation, regularized regression and Bayesian modeling,
can be used to infer interactions in a single cancer. Given the assumption
that miRNAs and target gene expression are negatively correlated, the
most straightforward method is through the Pearson correlation on pre-
processed (standardized and/or normalized) expression data. Although
regularized regression and Bayesian modeling can deal with collinearity
issues among miRNAs and provide a sparse solution with variable selec-
tion, a number of studies indicate that miRNA families with members of
high-sequence identity and miRNA clusters classiﬁed by genomic loca-
tions may present coexpression patterns and regulate genes cooperatively
(Chhabra et al., 2010; Cloonan et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2012). Therefore,
some true interactions might be incorrectly excluded by sparse solutions
among correlated miRNAs. Moreover, sparse solutions may choose
different sets of interaction pairs for each cancer when there is a strong
correlation among miRNAs and genes, leading to potential issue of
‘missing data’ when joint analysis is performed across cancers. Thus,

we have chosen to use Pearson correlation (Equation 1) to quantify the
statistical evidence of association between miRNAs and genes in each
cancer. The statistical signiﬁcance level is calculated by Fisher transform-
ation (Equation 2), an approximate variance-stabilizing transformation,
which follows a normal distribution.

where rdjk is the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between gene j and

disease (1; XM is the expression of miRNA k in individual i of disease d;
N; is the number of individuals in disease (1; zdjk is the z-score of each pair
gained from the Fisher transformation of the Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient.

To estimate the probabilities of interactions within each cancer, the
local false discovery rate (abbreviated as local fdr in the following) esti-
mation procedure developed by Efron (2004) was used to simultaneously
consider all miRNAigene interactions. Local fdr is an empirical Bayes
method suitable for large-scale hypothesis testing involving many hypoth-
eses, and it performs well when most of the cases belong to the null
distribution and the test statistic under the null distribution is approxi-
mately normally distributed. The local fdr estimates the empirical null
distribution from the central peak in the z-values’ histogram, which is
preferred over permutation-based null distribution estimation when dila-
tion effects (unobserved covariates) are present (Efron, 2004). The local
fdr method ﬁts well for the miRNAigene interaction analysis, as most
miRNA and gene pairs do not interact, the z-scores calculated from
Equation (2) approximately follow a normal distribution and unobserved
covariates are universal in biological studies. The local fdr for each
miRNAigene within a cancer is estimated by:

For a set of Z-values, locfdr(zdjk) and pdo can be estimated from R

package ‘locfdr’, based on the local fdr method. With the Pearson cor-

relation, Fisher transformation and local fdr estimation, we infer the

probabilities of interactions within each cancer, given the expression de-
pendency between genes and miRNAs.

2.1.2 Inference of cross—cancer pairs probability In the ﬁrst stage
analysis as discussed earlier in the text, miRNAigene interactions are
studied in cancers individually. Therefore, shared information across mul-
tiple cancers is not taken into account. In the second stage, we jointly
analyze multiple cancers with an empirical Bayes approach to effectively
incorporate shared information to identify interactions. The ultimate goal

of this joint analysis is to estimate the probability of interactions in cancer
d given the z-scores of all cancers 17(th = llzljk, .. . , 201).).

In our following discussion, multiple studies refer to different cancers
that may have distinct miRNA regulatory networks. Therefore, it is
expected that only a fraction of the interactions is shared among cancers.
In addition, we expect that cancers that are more closely related (e.g.
ovarian cancer and breast cancer) should have a higher degree of sharing
than those that are more distantly related. In other words, the joint
miRNAigene interaction patterns across cancers are dependent on
both the interaction probabilities in each individual cancer (derived in
Section 2.1.1) and the overall similarity of miRNA regulatory networks
across cancers. To quantify the overall similarity, the most straightfor-
ward way is to calculate the fraction of miRNAigene pairs shared
between two cancers. The rationale can be formulated as follows. Let
([1, . . . , ID) denote the joint interaction status among cancers for a study
of D cancers with [,1 representing the status of interaction in cancer d. As
[,1 could be either 1 or 0, the joint status of D cancers has 2D possible
patterns. For example, there are eight joint patterns (0,0,0), (0,0,1),
(0,1,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,0) and (1,1,1) for three cancers under
study. Let 71(t1, ...,tD) denote the probability for pattern ([1, ...,tD).
The overall similarity of miRNA regulation between cancers u and v
(1 5 u, v 5 D,u 75 v) can be quantiﬁed by the fraction of shared pairs
from 71(t1, ..., ID) by Equation (5).

Similarity(u, v) = % (p0,, = lltv = l) +p(t‘, = lltu = 1))

_1 t,,:1.t,:1 (“21.521

_2 Zn(tl,...,tD) Zn(t1,...,tD)

{,2} (“:1

 

Thus, the interactions common across cancers, which are shown by the
overall similarity, can be incorporated into the joint estimation of pairs
via the probability for each interaction pattern ([1, . . . , ID). In our algo-
rithm, we use 71(t1, ..., ID) to implicitly represent the overall similarity,
considering indirectly using the similarity scores in the study.

Then, we consider combining the probability of individual cancers
with similarity [via 71(t1, .. . , [0)] for inference of interactions. Although
z-scores of the pairs are not independent among cancers because of the
shared information, we assume conditional z-scores of a pair in different
cancers are independent when the status of interactions for each cancer is
known; therefore, the probability of observing z-scores given the inter-
action status is:

P(lek, ---, ZDﬂtltljka ---, [0th) =P(lek|l1jk) - - -I7(ZDjk|tDjk)v (6)

By combining the estimated probabilities in individual cancers and esti-

probability of interaction between gene j and miRNA k given observed 2-
scores.

among cancers are subjected to subsequent analysis of interaction
identification.

The performance of our proposed method, MCMG, was compared
with the existing methods to infer miRNAegene interactions from expres—
sion datasets. The representative methods we compared include the
Pearson correlation in the simple correlation analysis category, Lasso
regression (Lu et (1]., 2011) in the simpleiregularized regression category
and GenMir++ (Huang et (1]., 2007) in the Bayesian inference category.
Because the existing methods cannot perform joint analysis, they were
applied both to individual cancers and simple aggregate datasets (concat—
enate all cancer data together to form one set).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Simulation studies

To assess the effectiveness of MCMG, we performed four sets of
simulations as described in the ‘Methods’ section.

We first considered a simple biological setting where the two
cancers shared the same set of miRNAegene pairs and investi-
gated the effect of interaction strengths on the performance of
our method. We assumed the mean values for the alternative
distribution to be 71, i2 and 73, respectively. The estimation
of the probability of the null distribution ([240) was 0.995
(Fig. 2A), 0.961 (Fig. 2B) and 0.916 (Fig. 2C), respectively, by
the maximum likelihood estimation, where the true [20 was 0.9.
The estimation of [20 is more accurate with larger separations.
In Figure 2D, the precision-recall curves show that the joint
analysis improved the detection of true interactions under all
mean values of non-null distribution even when the true inter-
actions were not able to be well-distinguished from the null
distribution as u = 71. The greatest improvement was achieved
by u = 72, as a larger separation such as u = i3 is already
sufﬁcient to identify the majority of true interactions with

single cancer analysis. Thus, in the following simulations, we
used u = 72 or 2 to estimate the beneﬁt of joint inference of
multiple cancers.

The second set of simulations explored the effect of similarity
(the proportion of overlapping interaction sets) among cancers.
The underlying idea of MCMG is to integrate commonality
among cancers to increase the power of detection of true inter-
actions and reduce false-positive results. So we expect a higher
number of shared interactions among cancers would enhance the
accuracy of posterior probability estimation from single cancer
analysis. This was the case as shown in Figures 3A7C with dif-
ferent numbers of cancers studied, which indicates that MCMG
can capture the shared information well. In addition, Figure 3
also reveals that more different but related cancers involved in

joint analysis provide the opportunity to compensate the inter-

action heterogeneity among each other, which results in a higher
power to discover true positives. Speciﬁcally, different inter-
actions may be shared by different groups of cancers under
study. More cancer types present in a joint study offer greater
shared information available on interactions, leading to im-
proved inference. Then, we used probabilities of status
71(11, ...,10) to calculate the similarities as shown in Equation
(5). The estimated similarities have a linear relationship with true
similarities, but ~1(P20% lower than the true ones considering
the absolute values (Fig. 3D). It might be mainly because of the
difﬁculty to classify the pairs at the boundary of null and alter-
native distributions. But the accurate estimation of the similarity
trend would help MCMG to put correct ‘weights’ [71(11, . . . , 10)]
among cancers to infer interactions.

In the last scenario, we examined an effect that is specific and
inevitable in miRNA studies, namely, the presence of positive
correlations (~5% of all pairs) between miRNA and their tar-
gets. The systematic positive correlations may increase the pos-
terior probability for some false interactions. In this simulation,
the effect of systematic positive correlations was investigated to
see whether these ‘unwanted’ correlations would affect the pre-
diction of true sets. The precision-recall curves were just slightly
lower compared with those of negative true sets only (Fig. 3A),
and the improvement of prediction was still obvious (Fig. 4),
suggesting that the presence of high positive z-scores may not
affect the performance of the method. The standard deviation
of precision and recall calculated in all scenarios ranges from
0 to 0.04 with a median of ~0.02, which shows the stability of
the methods on interaction discovery among repeats in the
simulations.

3.2 Real data application

In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method on miRNAegene interaction identiﬁcation using TCGA
datasets. First, expression proﬁles of two cancers generated with
the same technique (gene expression microarray) were used to
show the improvement of inference. Then, we incorporated
another cancer studied by RNA-seq to illustrate the analysis
of three cancers and the ability of our method to naturally
incorporate different data types in interaction inference.

3.2.1 T wo cancers wit/1 the same data type We first considered
paired expression profiling of 0V and GBM. In total, 4698 genes
and 119 miRNAs with high variability among samples were
selected. The estimation of the probability of null distribution
[20 was 0.919 and 0.871 for 0V and GBM, respectively. The fact
that the estimated [20 was close to 0.9 suggested that a substantial
fraction (~10%) of pairs may interact, despite some non-null
pairs may be contributed by the heterogeneity of samples in
one cancer. The proposed method converged after 20 iterations
with the probabilities of_joint status (OV, GBM) (0,0), (0,1), (1,0)
and (1,1) estimated to be 0.829, 0.056, 0.0532 and 0.0619, respect-
ively. The similarity of miRNA regulatory genes between 0V
and GBM was estimated to be 53.14% by Equation (5).
Because our method may underestimate the similarity between
cancers as suggested in simulation scenarios II and III (Fig. 3)

aggregate dataset combining 0V and GBM. l-‘or MCMG, all results
are from joint analysis. The ‘OV’ and ‘GMB’ in (1) represent the results
from MCMG. For some cutoffs, methods may show higher number of
predicted interactions than the value of cutoff when several pairs have
identical scores, so we rescaled the number of validated interactions to
make sure the cutoff values are the same across methods

 

due to ambiguous pairs at boundaries, the true similarity
between these two cancers may be higher.

To visualize how joint analysis impacts the inferred interaction
pairs compared with single cancer analysis, Figure 5A and B
for 0V and GBM compared the inferred probabilities from
within-cancer and cross-cancer analysis to z-scores from the
Pearson correlation. Within-cancer inference, which was calcu-
lated from the Fisher transformed correlation and followed
by local fdr estimation, did not change the order of z-scores,
but cross-cancer inference did lead to a different priority of inter-
actions because of the joint analysis of multiple cancers.
Therefore, joint inference using data from two cancers clearly
re-prioritized candidate miRNAegene interactions through
incorporating shared information among cancers.

To show that joint analysis led to improved inference of inter-
actions, the results from MCMG were compared with those from
three representative approaches with single cancer analysis and/
or simple aggregate analysis, including the Pearson correlation,
Lasso (Lu et at, 2011) and GenMir++ (Huang et at, 2007),
which were proven to enrich the signals compared with
sequence-based prediction. MCMG jointly analyzed multiple

cancers, whereas three existing methods were applied both to
individual cancers and simple aggregates of both cancer datasets
because these methods are not able to perform joint analysis. We
focused on the 21 806 miRNAegene pairs that were predicted by
TargetScan V6.1 (Lewis et al., 2005) for method comparison
because other methods performed the selection within predicted
interaction sets as designed in their original articles. It is likely
that different cancers may share common miRNAegene inter—
actions because miRNAs globally regulate genes in tissues and
developmental stages. This is the assumption underlying both the
analysis of aggregated dataset and our proposed method. Thus,
the ﬁrst comparison was to examine how each method identiﬁed
common and speciﬁc interactions for two cancers (Fig. 5C7F).
By considering the top 1000 interactions predicted by each
method, the Pearson correlation (Fig. 5D) just set the hard
cutoff at z—score around —0.2 for selection, which identiﬁed
203 common interactions between 0V and GBM. The other
three approaches, including Lasso, GenMir++ and our pro—
posed method, prioritized the interactions differently, and we
observed great differences between these three methods and the
naive correlation method. As expected, our proposed method
was able to identify the largest number of common pairs
(614 pairs) by integrating shared information (Fig. 5C). By con—
sidering the commonality of miRNA regulatory mechanisms, the
joint analysis stage of MCMG with the empirical Bayes method
provided valuable information to prioritize interactions seen in
two cancers over the ones found in only one when they have
similar z—scores. Meanwhile, our method still identiﬁed
miRNAegene interaction pairs (396 pairs) speciﬁc for each
cancer that account for the heterogeneity among cancers.
GenMir++ identiﬁed 204 common pairs (Fig. 5F), similar to
the Pearson correlation (Fig. 5D), whereas Lasso only identiﬁed
127 common ones and some of them even had z—scores near 0
(Fig. 5E). The reason might be that the pairs in Lasso were
ranked with a reﬁned score from 100 to 0 based on estimated
regression coefﬁcient in each gene separately. The ranking
method might be good if multiple diseases are combined to
ﬁnd pairs because more sets of genes might be involved in
miRNA regulation processes. However, here we studied cancers
separately, and the ranking method may select some pairs from
genes not involved in the miRNA regulation in the cancer, which
results in high ranking but with small z—values.

To further evaluate the performance of the proposed method,
we examined the number of validated interactions identiﬁed in the
top of the target lists by each method in CV (Fig. 5G) and GBM
(Fig. 5H). Among predicted ones by TargetScan, 72 were experi—
mentally validated and curated by TarBase V5.0 (Papadopoulos
et al., 2009). Enrichment of validated targets is improved by
all methods incorporating expression data compared with the
sequence—based prediction—only method TargetScan. The
Pearson correlation and GenMir++ had a similar number of
validated targets at different cutoffs. The Lasso method did not
perform well in CV, but had similar performance in GBM.
However, MCMG showed consistently better identiﬁcation of
validated targets in every cutoff in this two—cancer study.

The comparison methods can be applied to aggregated data—
sets concatenating the two cancers together. We applied the
Pearson correlation, Lasso and GenMir++ to concatenated
0V and GBM data (Fig. 5I). Probably because of the refined

scores provided by the Lasso method for each gene separately,
Lasso performed better than the other two methods in the situ—
ation of aggregated dataset when more genes might be involved
in the miRNA regulatory network than that of a single cancer
dataset. However, all comparison methods identified fewer
validated targets than those identiﬁed by the analysis of single
cancers. So MCMG had even better performance here because it
already showed enhanced identiﬁcation of pairs compared with
single cancer analysis in Figure 5G and H. Higher accuracy of
single cancer analysis compared with simple aggregate analysis
also conﬁrmed the hypothesis that when the sample size is sufﬁ—
ciently large, single cancer analysis would be preferred.

3.2.2 Three cancers with different data types Next, we
considered joint analysis of three cancers (OV, GBM, BRCA)
collected on different platforms, where BRCA was generated by
RNAseq, whereas the other two were measured by microarrays.
These three datasets are not able to be concatenated because of
their different formats, so the existing methods can only be
applied to single cancer analysis, but not aggregate analysis.
However, our method can naturally incorporate different data
types to infer interacting miRNAegene pairs. The within—cancer
inference step generates normalized z—scores for all cancers no
matter what the data type is, and then there is no difﬁculty
to apply the second stage cross—cancer inference of MCMG to
well—formatted z—scores.

The estimated probabilities converged after 26 iterations for
the joint status (OV, GBM, BRCA): 0.7282, 0.0971, 0.0532,
0.0198, 0.0169, 0.0287, 0.0207 and 0.0355, for (0,0,0), (0,0,1),
(0,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0) and (1,1,1), respectively.
The similarity between 0V and BRCA was estimated to be
49.26%, which was higher than the 36.66% estimated between
GBM and BRCA, showing closer relationship of 0V and BRCA
than GBM and BRCA. Despite the 49.36% similarity score
between 0V and GBM, the percentage of shared interactions
of OV—GBM and OV—BRCA in all the potential interaction list
of CV was 56.16 and 64.19%, which agreed with the conclusion
that the estimated similarity of 0V and BRCA is higher than
GBM and BRCA. This is consistent with our expectation that
BRCA and 0V are more similar among the three cancers be—
cause they are both female cancers and share some commonality

the identical scores, so we rescaled the number of validated interactions to
make sure the cutoff values are the same across methods

in cancer—causing mutations or pathways (The Cancer Genome
Atlas Network, 2012). Thus, MCMG led to a reasonable simi—
larity inference among cancers based on geneemiRNA inter—
action data.

The number of validated interactions in the top lists was
also investigated for the three—cancer study. The results of 0V
(Fig. 6A) and GBM (Fig. 6B) are similar to those from the joint
analysis of two cancers, as our method can identify the largest
number of validated interactions from predicted ones. For
BRCA (Fig. 6C), Lasso had better prediction than Pearson
and GenMir++. But our proposed method was still the best
among all methods from the top list 20(L1000.

Thus, real data analyses showed that our method outper—
formed existing methods by taking into account shared informa—
tion and provided good assessment of relationship among
cancers.

4 CONCLUSION

The existing analysis of miRNAegene interactions with expres—
sion data is either based on a single cancer dataset or an aggre—
gated dataset concatenated from multiple cancers. In this article,
we proposed a novel approach (MCMG) to study microRNAe
gene interactions with paired expression profiles. We use an em—
pirical Bayes method to explicitly borrow information among
cancers to improve the identiﬁcation of interactions. With simu—
lation studies considering features of geneemiRNA pair data and
two sets of real TCGA data analysis, we demonstrated the bene—
ﬁt of our joint analysis compared with single cancer or simple
aggregate analysis. MCMG can efﬁciently recognize common
interactions, and also retains speciﬁc miRNA regulations for
each cancer. Interestingly, the hidden relationship among cancers
could also be quantitatively estimated by our method based on
miRNAegene pairs data, which might be useful for other disease
studies as well. This two—stage method infers the probability of
interactions within each cancer and then the posterior marginal
probability considering all cancers in a sequential manner, which
enables us to naturally combine cancers with different data types
in the study. The two—stage design also provides the possibility to
substitute the initial step (Pearson correlation) with results from
other methods (such as Lasso or Bayesian inference) if one pre—
fers, and then they can still benefit from the second stage of
integrating multiple cancers for better prediction.

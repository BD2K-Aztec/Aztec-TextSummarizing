assay. (b) The isotype of an assembled heayy chain can be identified using the assembled
constant region sequence. (c) Relatiy e clone abundance can be accurately measured using
reads mapped to assembled clones. ((l) Nucleotide resolution assembly prox ides the
ability to perform mutation specific analyses including somatic hypermutation assessment
and clonal diy ersity of the sample.

RNA quality. Affymetrix chips contain special probe sets de—
signed to bind 5/ or 3/ ends of actin and GAPDH transcripts,
and the ratio of their signal level is used as a quality parameter
(Affymetrix, 2001). Another method that measures RNA deg—
radation takes advantage of the fact that the expression level of
each gene is estimated using multiple probes. When probes in
every probe set are ordered according to the localization of their
binding site in target transcript, the average signal of probes with
binding sites closer to the 5/ end of transcripts is shifted toward
lower values. The slope of the line from the graph illustrating this
trend can be used as a quality measure (Gautier et al., 2004). The
most widely used Affymetrix arrays have, for each probe that
perfectly matches the target transcript, also a ‘MM probe’ that
has a single nucleotide mismatch in the middle of the sequence.
The MM probes were intended to measure the level of unspeciﬁc
background signal for corresponding PM probes. The difference
in signal level between pairs of PM and MM probes from the
same probe sets is used to generate present/absent calls with the
MASS algorithm, and the percentage of present calls is one
of the quality metrics proposed by the Affymetrix company
(Affymetrix, 2001; Wilson and Miller 2005). Kauffmann et a].
(2009) suggested the inspection of the difference between distri—
butions of signal levels of PM and MM probes as part of the
quality assessment of microarray experiments. In the current
study, we quantify this tendency by computing the value of
the paired t—test statistic from the signal levels of all PM/
MM probe pairs. The Average Background, one of the measures
of quality that can be obtained from the original Affymetrix
GCOS software, is simply the average of the 2% lowest cell
intensities on the chip, and higher values of this parameter sug—
gest high levels of nonspeciﬁc binding. The scaling factor is a
value that should be used to multiply all values of intensities on
the chip to scale the 2% trimmed mean signal to a selected con—
stant (Affymetrix, 2001). Finally, the most popular multi—array
quality metrics are Relative Log Expression (RLE) and
Normalized Unscaled Standard Error (NUSE), which are
based on comparisons of the outcome of Robust Multichip
Analysis/Probe Level Model fitting procedures between arrays
from the same experiment (Bolstad et al., 2004; Gautier et al.,
2004; Irizarry et al., 2003). In the RLE method, medians of probe
set expression values are subtracted from expression values of all
arrays in the experimental series. If the quality of a given array
does not differ greatly from the average quality in the dataset,
then such subtracted expression values center around 0 and dis—
play interquantile ranges similar to other arrays. The NUSE
values measure precision of estimation of expression values.
Shifted or wider distribution of NUSE values indicates problems
with the quality of a particular array. The more general version
of this parameter, Global Normalized Uncalled Standard Error
(GNUSE), compares the standard error of expression estimation
with the values stored in precomputed frozen parameter vectors
obtained on the basis of analysis of many arrays of the same type
together (McCall et al., 2011).

The beneﬁcial inﬂuence of removing outlier arrays for micro—
array data analysis has been demonstrated in several studies
(Asare et al., 2009; Kauffmann and Huber, 2010; McCall
et al., 2011). Development and testing of methods for evaluating
the quality of microarray data between experiments suffer from
the lack of a good benchmark. In the current study, we propose

to use the degree of conservation of expression profile between
species as an independent indicator of quality and to assess per—
formance of the most popular quality control methods along
with a new method developed by us. We show that our new
IQRray method is consistently the best in predicting the quality
of microarrays.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Distribution of probe set average ranks

The IQRray statistic is obtained by ranking all the probe intensities from
a given array and by computing the average rank for each probe set. The
interquartile range (IQR) of the probe sets average ranks serves then as
quality score. The simulated distribution of average ranks from probe sets
composed from random probes was obtained by random assignment of
ranks to probes from arrays. The simulated distribution of average ranks
from probe sets with consistent ranks within probe sets was obtained by
assigning succeeding ranks to probes from the same probe sets. In both
cases, the number of probe sets and the number of probes were identical
to arrays of the HG-Ul33_Plus_2 type. Real examples of low-
(GSM50702) and high (GSM371402) quality arrays of HG-
U133_Plus_2 type were selected from the Bgee database.

2.2 Expression data

We selected from the Bgee database (Bastian et al., 2008) seven homolo-
gous human and mouse organs represented by high numbers of micro-
array results, obtained using Affymetrix platforms HG-Ul 33_Plus_2 and
Mouse430_2, respectively. The number of samples and experiments for
each organ are presented in Table 1. All results from prenatal develop-
ment stages were excluded from the analysis. In the case of the testis
dataset, only data from adult developmental stage were included. Five
human and six mouse datasets composed of arrays from at least ﬁve
independent experiments were used as a training set for benchmarking
quality control metrics. The datasets that have not passed this criterion
were used as reference only (see Table 1). The complete list of arrays and
experiments used in the study is included in Supplementary Table S1. The
initial source of all experiments whose names start with ‘GSE’ is the GEO
database (Edgar et al., 2002); all the other experiments were originally
downloaded from ArrayExpress (Brazma et al., 2003).

2.3 Computing quality control parameters

The raw data from CEL ﬁles were read into the R environment using the
package affy (Gautier et al., 2004) from Bioconductor (Gentleman et al.,
2004). The parameters of average background, percent present, scaling
factor and ratios between probe sets for 3’ and 5’ end of actin and

GAPDH transcripts were calculated using the R package simpleaffy
(Wilson and Miller, 2005). The slope for RNA degradation was obtained
using the package affy (Gautier et al., 2004). RLE and NUSE metrics
were computed with the package affyPLM (Bolstad et al., 2005) using all
arrays that belong to certain experiment. The GNUSE values for every
array were computed with the package fRMA (McCall et al., 2010) and
relevant packages with fRMA vectors available in Bioconductor. Quality
parameters for all arrays used as a training set are included in
Supplementary Table S1.

2.4 Preprocessing of raw data

The raw data from CEL ﬁles were read into R. The signal values for PM
probes were averaged for every probe set. The mapping between probe set
IDs and gene IDs were taken from Ensembl version 69 (Flicek et al., 2013).
Probe sets that match more than one gene were excluded. The expression
values of independent probe sets that match the same gene were averaged.
Only results for genes with one to one orthology between mouse and
human with matching probe sets on both microarray types (according to
Ensembl version 69) were used in further analysis (13 136 genes in total).

2.5 Correlation of the expression proﬁles between
homologous organs

The pairwise Spearman correlation coefﬁcients between expression pro-
ﬁles of all arrays from organ-speciﬁc datasets and homologous organ
reference datasets were computed. For every array from an organ-speciﬁc
dataset, the highest correlation coefﬁcient [the homology organ correl-
ation (HOC)] obtained was selected and used in further analysis. We used
the highest correlation to decrease the probability that the array would be
classiﬁed as low quality because of natural biological variability related,
for example, to age or sex. The HOC score for all arrays used as a
training set are included in Supplementary Table S1.

2.6 Performance of quality metrics

The correlations between quality parameters and HOC scores were calcu-
lated using the Spearman correlation coefﬁcient. For some parameters,
larger values are better (e.g. percent present), whereas for others, smaller
values are better (e.g. GNUSE); these are noted as ‘ascending’ or ‘des-
cending’, respectively, in Supplementary Table S2a and b. Quality scores
from all ‘descending’ methods were multiplied by —1 before computing
correlations. Correlation for all organs together was obtained after trans-
forming values of HOC score into quartiles for every organ separately. To
evaluate the performance of quality metrics in detecting the lowest quality
arrays, we selected the worst 5% samples according to each quality control
method from all organ-speciﬁc datasets and analyzed the distribution of
their quartile of HOC scores. The 5% cutoff value that was used for each
quality control method can be found in Supplementary Table S2a and b.

2.7 Quality control of Bgee database

The distributions of IQRray and percent present quality score values were
computed using large numbers of independent arrays from the Bgee
(array type Mouse430_2 and HG-Ul33_Plus_2) and GEO (15 other
types of arrays) databases. The arrays from GEO were selected using
the GEOmetadb and GEOquery R packages (Zhu et al., 2008). The
number of arrays taken from each experiment was limited to 10 to
ensure that the arrays from large experiments do not bias the computa-
tion of the cutoff value. Quantiles for the percent present and IQRray
scores, as well as the number of arrays used for computation, are reported
in Supplementary Table S3A and S3B. In Bgee, we decided to use cutoff
values that allow removing the worst 5% arrays according to either per-
cent present or IQRray score. All arrays that did not satisfy one or both
of the quality thresholds were removed from the database.

3 RESULTS
3.1 IQRray

Because of the limitations of available methods, we propose a
new method for multi—experiment quality control. In Affymetrix
technology, the final expression level is computed on the basis of
intensity levels of several independent probes matching the same
target messenger RNA. In our new IQRray method, we trans—
form all probe signal values into ranks and subsequently com—
pute the average rank of probes that belong to the same probe
set. We expect that the higher the quality of a given array, the
more consistent the levels of probe signal from the same probe
set. The average rank of probes from a probe sets that match
highly expressed genes should be high, whereas the average rank
of probes sets that match lowly or not expressed genes should be
low. All factors that increase signal noise, such as unspeciﬁc hy—
bridization or spatial artifacts, are expected to lead to a more
random distribution of probe signals among probe sets. Mixing
of low and high ranks in the same probe set should shift the value
of the average rank of a probe set toward the average rank of all
probes on the array. Consequently, lower quality microarrays
will have more narrow spreads of distribution of rank averages.
As a measure of this tendency, we propose to use IQR of probe
set average rank: the IQRray score. Figure 1 shows distributions
of probe set average ranks from two idealized arrays: one where
intensities of probes in probe sets had consistent values and a
second where signal values were assigned randomly to the probe
sets. We also selected from microarrays in the Bgee database
examples of arrays with extreme IQRray scores. It can be seen
that the IQR of probe set average ranks is much smaller when
the signal values were distributed randomly among probe sets
than when they have consistent signal values. The distribution of
probe sets’ average ranks of a presumptive low—quality array
resembles the distribution of probes with randomly assigned
values. The distribution of a presumptive high—quality array
shows, in contrast, a bimodal shape due to probe sets targeting
lowly or not expressed genes and highly expressed genes.

3.2 Benchmarking of QC metrics

To compare the performance of the newly proposed method and
existing ones for quality control, we set up a test study using 11
large organ—speciﬁc datasets75 for human and 6 for mice. We
use the similarity of its expression proﬁle to a reference proﬁle of
the homologous organ from the other species as an external in—
dependent quality indicator for each microarray. We determined
for every array the Homologous Organ Correlation score (HOC
score, see Section 2). We expect that the lower quality arrays will
display less biological signal and consequently a lower correl—
ation with the reference. All arrays analyzed displayed a positive
correlation with the profile of the homologous organ (Fig. 2),
which is consistent with the previously reported conservation of
orthologous gene expression in homologous tissues (Brawand
et al., 2011; Piasecka et al., 2012; Zheng—Bradley et al., 2010).
However, in each dataset, outlier samples of suspicious quality
with unusually low HOC scores can be found. These arrays
should be preferentially removed through quality control
procedure.

Fig. 4. Spearman p values from correlation test between quality metrics and HOC score for (a) human and (b) mouse organ—specific datasets

assigning falsely low scores to good-quality arrays. We simulated
a quality control check for a collection of microarrays. We se-
lected the 5 and 10% of samples with the lowest quality accord-
ing to each quality control method from all samples used in the
study (Supplementary Table S2). We show the distribution of
HOC scores for arrays selected with a 5% cutoff (Fig. 5). We
also measured the efﬁciency of methods in selecting the arrays
with the lowest quality by computing the proportion of results
below a chosen cutoff value (Supplementary Table S2) displaying
a quantile of HOC values also below the same cutoff (e. g. quan-
tiles <5 % for 5% cutoff) (Supplementary Table S2). The method
that consistently was the most efﬁcient in identifying the worst
quality arrays was IQRray.

For both mouse and human data, all samples selected by
this method had quantiles <0.2, which means that they were
of considerably lower quality than other samples derived
from the same tissue. This method also identified the highest
proportion (~60% in all cases) of low-quality arrays using
both 5 and 10% cutoffs. Again, the other methods that
performed relatively well were percent present and PM/MM
l-test. Consistent with previous results, the GNUSE metric
showed high performance for mouse data and confusing
results for human data. Among the traditional methods
used for quality assessment of microarrays, the scaling
factor gave relatively good results for both human and
mouse datasets.

visible, and its strength measured by either PM/MM paired t—test
or by proportion of probe sets called present seems to be a good
indicator of quality. This result might be explained by the fact
that the occurrence of differences in hybridization strength be—
tween PM and MM probes is strictly dependent on the specificity
of target binding, and all factors that negatively inﬂuence it also
diminish this difference. These methods might be less suitable to
detect loss of quality caused by spatial artifacts, although be—
cause of the fact that the pairs of MM/PM probes are located
next to each other on the surface of the microarray, the large
intensive surface artifacts also probably have an impact of the
ﬁnal quality score.

The performances of GNUSE scores, the only quality par—
ameter intended for direct comparison of quality between dif—
ferent experiments, differ signiﬁcantly between mouse and
human datasets. Such a discrepancy may indicate that al—
though the assumptions of the methodology are correct, the
differences in experimental protocol strongly inﬂuence the final
results, as was suggested by the GNUSE authors (McCall,
et al., 2011). The other possible explanation of this phenom—
enon is simply lower quality of the fRMA vector specific for
the human HG—U133_Plus_2 array. If a higher proportion of
human microarray experiments is of lower quality, then the
frozen parameter vector prepared on the basis of these data
may underestimate the natural variance in probe signal from
the same probe set.

Despite the fact that methods for the analysis of microarray
results are already in their maturity, and a lot of effort and at—
tention has been made toward improving methods of quality
assessment of microarrays, including calling two international
consortia EMERALD and MAQC (Beisvag et al., 2011;
Canales et al., 2006), there are still no objective rules for deﬁning
absolute quality of microarrays. Our new IQRray algorithm for
quality control of microarrays appears to be powerful in detect—
ing of low—quality arrays, as are the PM/MM t—test and the
percentage called present, as measured by our independent evo—
lutionary conservation—based quality metric. We strongly recom—
mend using one or several of these metrics before performing
meta—analyses or integrating microarrays into databases, as we
do in Bgee.

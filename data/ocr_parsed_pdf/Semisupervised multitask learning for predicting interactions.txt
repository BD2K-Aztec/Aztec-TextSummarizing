ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein—protein interactions (PPls) are critical for virtually
every biological function. Recently, researchers suggested to use
supervised learning for the task of classifying pairs of proteins as
interacting or not. However, its performance is largely restricted by
the availability of truly interacting proteins (labeled). Meanwhile, there
exists a considerable amount of protein pairs where an association
appears between two partners, but not enough experimental
evidence to support it as a direct interaction (partially labeled).
Results: We propose a semi-supervised multi-task framework for
predicting PPls from not only labeled, but also partially labeled
reference sets. The basic idea is to perform multi-task learning on a
supervised classification task and a semi-supervised auxiliary task.
The supervised classifier trains a multi-layer perceptron network
for PPI predictions from labeled examples. The semi-supervised
auxiliary task shares network layers of the supervised classifier and
trains with partially labeled examples. Semi-supervision could be
utilized in multiple ways. We tried three approaches in this article,
(i) classification (to distinguish partial positives with negatives);
(ii) ranking (to rate partial positive more likely than negatives);
(iii) embedding (to make data clusters get similar labels). We applied
this framework to improve the identification of interacting pairs
between HIV-1 and human proteins. Our method improved upon
the state-of-the-art method for this task indicating the benefits of
semi-supervised multi-task learning using auxiliary information.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identifying protein—protein interactions (PPIs) in a comprehensive
manner is essential for understanding the molecular basis underlying
biological functions. Because of their importance in development
and disease, PPIs have been the subject of intense research in recent
years, both computationally and experimentally.

Experimental techniques for detecting PPIs have been reviewed
in Shoemaker and Panchenko (2007a). Traditionally, PPIs have
been studied individually through the use of genetic, biochemical
and biophysical experimental techniques (also termed small-scale
methods). Experiments in this paradigm are typically expensive
and time-consuming (months for detecting just one PPI). In recent
years, large-scale biological PPI experiments have been introduced
to directly detect hundreds or thousands of protein interactions
at a time. The two-hybrid (Y2H) screens (Ito et al., 2001; Rual
et al., 2005; Stelzl et al., 2005; Uetz et al., 2000) and complex

puriﬁcation detection techniques using mass spectrometry (Gavin
et al., 2002, 2006; Ho et al., 2002) are the two most popular
approaches thus far applied successfully on a large scale . However,
their resulting data sets are often incomplete and exhibit high false
positive and false negative rates (von Mering et al., 2002; Yu et al.,
2008).

Computational methods have been successfully applied to predict
protein interactions (reviewed in Shoemaker and Panchenko,
2007b). Taking into account that indirect sources may contain
partial evidence about protein interations, several approaches derive
their predictions on particular types of information, such as
overrepresented domain pairs in interacting proteins (Wang et al.,
2007). An alternative attractive approach is to integrate various
indirect or direct sources of evidence in a statistical learning
framework. A classiﬁer is trained to distinguish between positive
examples of truly interacting protein pairs and negative examples
of non-interacting pairs. Various methods have been explored in
this framework, including naive Bayes classiﬁer by Jansen et al.
(2003), decision tree from Zhang et al. (2004), kernel-based methods
from Ben-Hur and Noble (2005) and Yamanishi et al. (2004),
random forest-based method (Qi et al., 2005), logistic regression
(Lin et al., 2004), and the strategies of summing likelihood ratio
scores (Lee et al., 2004; Rhodes et al., 2005; Scott and Barton,
2007). Most of these studies have been carried out in yeast or
human. They aimed to predict PPIs within a single organism (termed
‘intra—species PPI prediction’). Recent work extends to predicting
PPIs between organisms (‘inter-species PPI prediction’), especially
between host and pathogens. Tastan et al. (2009) extended the
supervised learning framework to predict PPIs between HIV-1
and human proteins. A random forest-based classiﬁer was used to
integrate multiple biological information sources and deﬁned the
state-of-art performance for this task. Additionally, Davis et al.
(2007) studied 10 host—pathogen PPIs using structural information.
Later, Evans et al. (2009) searched for host protein motifs along virus
protein sequences to obtain a list of host proteins highly enriched
with those targeted by HIV-1 proteins.

While the supervised framework was shown to enrich current
PPI data with additional inferred PPIs, its applicability is still
limited. Supervised PPI detection requires a large number of labeled
training examples (truely interacting proteins) in order for the
statistical classiﬁer to predict with proper accuracy. Except several
well-studied organisms, such as yeast or human, most inter or intra-
species PPI prediction tasks do not have a large number of reliable
PPIs available as training data. For instance, no reliable global
set of interacting pairs exist between HIV-1 and human proteins
(see Section 2.2). This limitation largely restricts the prediction
ability of current computational PPI algorithms. To conquer this

limitation, recently semi-supervised approaches were proposed for
computational PPI predictions. Yip and Gerstein (2009) proposed
to improve supervised predictions by adding pseudo examples from
previous runs of predictions. However, the predictions are prone to
noise using this strategy.

It is sometimes possible to infer a relatively larger number
of potentially interacting proteins, which may not have enough
evidence to be conﬁrmed as true positive labels. For instance, in the
task of predicting PPIs between HIV-1 and human proteins, NIAID
(Fu et al., 2008) database retrieved protein pairs between HIV-1
protein and human protein from the scientiﬁc literature (details in
Section 2). The extracted pairs are not experimentally conﬁrmed
PPIs, but are very likely to have interaction relationships. From
a ‘machine learning’ perspective, these pairs are weakly labeled
positive examples (see Fig. 1). In this case, an interesting question
to ask is how to detect and add weakly labeled pairs to improve
computational PPI predictions.

In this article, we present a multi-task learning framework to
make use of weakly labeled examples together with conventionally
labeled PPI pairs. A semi-supervised task is introduced in a network
consisting of multiple layer perceptron as an auxiliary task. We train
supervised PPI classiﬁcation and the semi-supervised auxiliary task
under the same network simultaneously. We apply our method to
predict the set of interacting proteins between HIV-1 and human
proteins by information integration of multiple biological sources.
Our method improves upon the previous approach applied for this
task. The results indicate that with the proposed semi-supervised
multi-task approach, auxiliary information (weak labels) is able to
improve the accuracy of the predictive models for PPIs between
HIV-1 and human proteins.

The rest of the article is structured as follows. Section 2 describes
the task of predicting PPIs between HIV-1 and human proteins and
the available interacting data set in more details. Section 3 describes
the semi-supervised multi-task learning framework. Section 4
presents the experimental results, and Section 5 concludes.

2 TARGET PROBLEM

HIV-1 causes the disease of acquired immune deﬁciency syndrome
(AIDS), which remains a serious and growing threat to public health
(Trkola, 2004). Both HIV-1 transmission and infection are complex
processes, where much remains to be elucidated. The HIV-1 RNA

encodes only a handful of proteins; however, it subverts the cellular
machinery for its beneﬁt. Virus—host PPIs are key in deciphering
virus strategies, and such understanding may lead to designing novel
ways to impede viral protein functions and thus reduce or eliminate
HIV-1’s potency as a deadly pathogen.

2.1 Information integration with multiple data sources

Recently, we made an attempt to predict the global set of interactions
between HIV-1 and human host cellular proteins in Tastan et al.
(2009). The task was to predict whether a given human to HIV-1
protein pair interacts or not. Thus it was formulated as a binary
classiﬁcation problem, where each protein pair belongs to either the
‘interaction’ or ‘non-interaction’ class. A random forest classiﬁer
was trained on a rich set of features including:

0 co-occurrence counts of binding motifs to matched interacting
domains;

0 gene expression proﬁle reﬂecting human gene expression
patterns across HIV-1 samples: infected versus uninfected;

0 similarity in terms of cellular location, molecular ﬁinction and
biological process;

0 similarity of HIV-1 protein to human protein’s known binding
human partners (in terms of localization/function/process);

0 pairwise sequence similarity between HIV-1 and human protein
or its known human binding partners;

0 if the HIV-1 protein shares any post-translational modiﬁcation
with human binding partners of the human protein;

0 similarity of tissue distributions;

0 topological properties of the human protein in human protein
interaction network, such as node degree;

0 HIV-1 protein type.

All data sources and how they were converted into features
representing protein pair between HIV-1 and human have been
described previously in Tastan et al. (2009) and are available for
download in our supplement web site.

2.2 Partial positive labels from NIAID

The gold stande positive set we used in Tastan et al. (2009) were
collected from NIAID (Fu et al., 2008) database where interactions
between HIV-1 and human proteins reported in the scientiﬁc
literature were manually curated. It includes 2620 protein pairs
involving 1406 human proteins and 17 HIV-1 proteins [15 HIV-1
proteins plus precursors of the envelope (env gp160) and gag (gag
pr55)]. Each interaction in the database is associated with keywords
extracted from scientiﬁc literature reporting the interaction. Some
of these keywords are strong such as ‘interacts with’ and ‘binds’
(we named this set as ‘GroupI’ containing 955 protein pairs). While
some other keywords are rather weak indicators of direct interactions
such as ‘upregulates’ or ‘inhibits’ (this set of pairs was named as
‘GroupII’ and included 1665 protein pairs). Our previous work
(Tastan et al., 2009) used those ‘GroupI’ interactions (associated
with strong keywords‘) as training positive examples for binary PPI
predictions.

Recent studies from Cusick et al. (2008) pointed out that the
literature-curated protein interaction experiments can be error-prone
and possibly of lower quality than commonly assumed. The ‘gold
standard’ reference set used in our previous work (Tastan et al., 2009)
was ad hocly built from ‘GroupI’ of NIAID. Clearly there exists
not enough evidence supporting the reliabilities of these interaction
labels from NIAID database.

2.3 Positive labels from experts’ annotations

To increase the data quality, we consulted 16 HIV-1 experts about
the validity of the interactions reported in the NIAID database. 15 of
the experts are professors well known in the HIV-1 ﬁeld and the last
expert is a PHD student, who had extensively worked on HIVl for
5 years. More details of experts’ annotation process is provided in
our supplementary web. HIV-1 experts were sent lists of interacting
pairs along with the interaction keywords and the links to the articles
reporting the interactions in NIAID. Experts are asked to annotate
each pair with the ‘interact’ label if they believe the reported pair
is a true direct interaction. If, on the other hand, either they do
not believe two proteins interact, annotating it with the label ‘not
interacting’, or they think the interaction might be indirect or they
are unsure about the label, annotating it as ‘unsure or indirect’. For
each HIV-1 protein, the rules to select potential interaction partners
sent to experts are diﬁ’erent. If for a certain HIV-1 protein, the total
number of interactions reported in NIAID is not many, we sent all
of the interactions reported in the database. In other cases, only the
subset of interactions associated with keywords ‘binds’ or ‘interacts
with’ was sent (the longer the list is, the slower and more reluctant
the experts’ responses were). In this way, 361 interacting pairs were
annotated. Most of the interactions (256/361) were annotated by a
single expert and the rest received labels from multiple experts. In
cases where there was a disagreement between experts’ opinions on
the labels, the ‘majority vote’ strategy was used to decide which
label should be assigned. Finally, this resulted in 158 protein pairs
that HIV-1 experts annotated as direct interactions between HIV-1
and human proteins.

Thus, this set serves as our positive ‘gold standard’ set. The rest of
the NIAID dataset are treated as ‘partial positives’ examples since
not enough evidence is yet accumulated for them to be considered
as direct interactions but they are likely candidates.

In summary, this binary classiﬁcation task contains 158 ‘experts-
annotated’ positive example and 2119 partial positive (with 552 from
‘groupI’ and 1567 from ‘groupII’) PPI pairs (after removing those
pairs labeled as ‘not interact’ and ‘interact’ from the experts). Each
HIV-1 human protein pair is represented with 18 features. Related
statistics of data sets used for this task are listed in Table 1.

The feature set used in our previous work (Tastan et al., 2009)
contains totally 35 attributes for each potential HIV-1 to Human
protein pair. Among them, 17 items represent which one (assuming i)

of the 17 HIV-1 proteins this pair involves with (with the i dimension
set to 1 and all the other 16 dimensions set to zero). As mentioned
above, since the creation process of experts annotated (positive)
labels is correlated non-randomly with the type of HIV-1 proteins,
we have to remove these 17 features, and use the remaining 18
features to describe each HIV-1 human protein pair. All labeled &
partially labeled examples are shared in our supplementary web.

3 METHOD

A d-dimensional (d = 18) feature vector x was constructed for every protein
pair (between a HIV-1 protein and a human protein). Each entry in the feature
vector summarizes one biological evidence (asking, for example, ‘Does this
HIV-1 protein include a certain motif that is highly likely to interact with one
of the domains in the human protein?’ (see Section 2.1). The target variable
ye {:l:1} represents whether this pair interacts (1) or not (—1). Thus, the
problem of predicting protein interactions is handled as a binary classiﬁcation
task.

Considering the small number of positive labels (158) and a larger set
of partial labels (2119), we propose to design semi-supervised multi-task
learning (SML) strategies for making use of both sets, to achieve better
prediction performance.

Given a set of labeled examples (x1 , . .. ,xL) and corresponding labels
()1; , . . . ,yL), our goal is to learn a supervised classiﬁer (e.g. choose a
discriminant function) f (x), such that ‘f(x,») > 0 if y,» = 1’ or ‘f(x,») < 0 if
Vi = — 1 ’-

3.1 A multi-layer perceptron network for supervised
PPI prediction

The supervised classiﬁer we chose is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network
with M layers of hidden units that gives a 1-dimensional output:

1%):wa me". (1)
f

where w0 is the weight vector for the output layer. The m-th hidden layer is
deﬁned as

h;"(x) = s (Zwym h}"_l(x)+b""i ),m=2, ...,M (2)

and S is a non-linear squashing function like ‘tanh’. To train this supervised
classiﬁer, we employ the Hinge loss (on labeled examples):

i2] i2]

3.2 Multi-task learning with semi-supervised auxiliary
task

According to the available labels, we could formalize our objective as two
tasks: (i) supervised classiﬁcation with positive (from experts) and negative
labels; (ii) the usage of partial positive labels in order to improve the
supervised classiﬁcation. One natural way to combine two objectives is
through multi-task learning.

Multitask learning is the procedure of learning several tasks at the same
time with the aim of mutual beneﬁts. A good overview of multi-task learning,
especially focusing on neural networks, can be found in Caruana (1997). The
idea of sharing information learnt across sub-tasks seems a more economical
use of data, where presumably all tasks are learnt jointly. A typical example
is a MLP network where ﬁrst layers will be shared to all tasks and typically
learn levels of feature processing that are useful to all tasks.

In our problem, the second task aims to make use of weak positive labels
and is auxiliary to the main classiﬁcation. We call them ‘semi-supervised
auxiliary task’ in this article since the task, uses just weak labels with

Fig. 2. To perform multi-task learning with the supervised PPI classiﬁcation, three semi-supervised tasks have been proposed to extend the network structure
of multi-layer perceptron: (a) training another classiﬁer to distinguish partial positive and negative examples; (b) training a ranker to sort partial positive and
negative data; (c) training an embedding on the output of the supervised classiﬁer.

diverse levels of conﬁdence (e.g. various keywords associated in NIAID
database). Typical semi-supervised learning refers to the use of both labeled
and unlabeled data during training. For our task, though not the typical semi-
supervised setting, we View it as a similar setup and the proposed auxiliary
tasks could be naturally extended to unlabeled data with side information,
e.g. functional association between proteins.

Formally speaking, multi-task learning of supervised classiﬁcation and
semi-supervised auxiliary task equals to learning two tasks jointly with the
optimization of the following loss function:

L
Zev(x,),y,)+x Loss (Auxiliary Task) (4)
i2]

There exist many ways to build this auxiliary task using MLP networks
(e.g. different network structure and/or distinct loss function). In the
following, we propose three possibilities (in Fig. 2).

3.3 Auxiliary Task 1: classiﬁcation

Figure 3a illustrates the ﬁrst strategy to use partial labels. This is the classical
way of multi-tasking in the MLP framework. Our auxiliary task shares the
ﬁrst in layers of the original MLP, but have a new output layer:

g(x)=Zm4-WX h,-M(x)+bAUX (5)
f
This network is trained to distinguish partial positive examples from
negative examples (e.g. classiﬁcation), simultaneously as we train the
original network on labeled data. Assuming a set of partially labeled
examples (xL+1,...,xL+U). In this auxiliary task, they are assigned
with corresponding pseudo labels (y’l+U,... ,y’L+U). We train this pseudo
classﬁciation with hinge loss as well, which means,

L-i—U
Loss (Auxiliary Task): 2 max(0, 1 —y]‘-g(xj)) (6)

j:L+1

3.4 Auxiliary Task 11: ranking

Illustrated in Figure 3b, this time we use the same network architecture for
both two tasks. The auxiliary information we know for the second task is
‘partial labeled PPI pairs are more likely to be true than negative pairs’. This
could be formalized as a ‘ranking’ task using MLP: to rank ‘weak positive
examples’ highly than ‘negative examples’ if ordering them by the output
f(x) from the MLP. Naturally, the above assumption comes to minimize a
ranking-type margin cost:

Loss( Aux.)= ZZmax (0, 1 —f(x,,)+f(x,,)), (7)

where P means the index of partial positives and N represents the set of
negative examples. The training is handled with stochastic gradient descent
which samples the cost online w.r.t. (p,n).

3.5 Auxiliary Task III: embedding on output

One key assumption used by many semi-supervised algorithms is the
structure assumption, which assumes that points within the same structure
(such as a cluster or a manifold) are likely to have the same label (Chapelle
et al., 2006). In Figure 20, we explore the partial labeled examples as a
guidance to explore the hidden structure assumption in our data.

This could be pursued through an embedding technique proposed in
Weston et al. (2008). The proposed model contains a network with two
identical copies of the same function, with the same weights, and with
outputs fed into a ‘distance’-measuring layer. Given two examples xi and
xj, we can feed each of them into these two identical networks, and use the
last ‘distance’ layer to compute whether the two examples are similar or not
(i.e. in terms of their network outputs). If we know in advance whether they
are similar or not, this pairwise ‘labeling’ could function as ‘hidden structure’
guidance and can be used for learning of parameters in the network (Fig. 20).
A margin-based loss following (Weston et al., 2008) is chosen for training:

 

1‘67va"): n
I] U max(0,m—IU£i—ijI2) IIWI'J'ZO

(8)

This loss function encourages similar examples (where WU- : 1) to be close
in output space, and dissimilar ones to have a distance of at least in from each
other’s output. WU- speciﬁes the similarity or dissimilarity between examples
xi and xj, which serves as the ‘pairwise labeling’ guidance for the embedding
loss function.

With partially labeled examples in our data, we could derive a set of
WU- labels to embedding training. Three strategies are considered in our

experiments to derive WU:

0 WU- : 1, if both examples from the partially labeled set;

0 W721, if one partially labeled example and the other from the
positively labeled set;

0 WU- :0, if one partially labeled example and the other a negatively
labeled example;

The main motivation is that even though examples of partial positive PPI
sets have not enough evidence to be considered as direct interactions,
they are highly likely candidates. Thus in the embedding of output space,
these examples should be similar to each other, and dissimilar to negative
examples. The embedding model is trained by the pairs of examples with
WU- labels. The training is also handled with stochastic gradient descent
which samples the cost online w.r.t (i , j). Training steps either ‘push’ similar
examples together or ‘pull’ dissimilar examples apart from each other. This
hidden structure is exactly what we want to preserve in the space of output
f(-) in our data.

It is very natural to multi-task embedding task with our main supervised
classiﬁcation task. Since embedding model makes use of a neural network
with two identical copies and an extra ‘distance measuring’ layer, we can just
use our supervised classiﬁer MLP as the base network for embedding. This
equals to add the embedding as a regularizer on our main classiﬁer MLP.
In Figure 20, a semi-supervised regularizer is added on the supervised loss
measured on the entire network’s output (1):

L L-i—U
Zemmnﬂ Z L(f(x,).f(x,-).Wi,-) (9)
i:1 i,j:l
Here, labeled training examples are denoted as xi, i = 1, . . . ,L and partially

labeled examples are denoted as xi, i=L+1,...,L+U. Essentially, multi-
tasking tries to classify labeled examples, whilst simultaneously the
embedding tries to push the classiﬁcation score of partial positive examples
close to the scores of positive examples, and apart from those scores of
negative labeled examples.

3.6 Semi-supervised multi-task learning

The overall goal of the auxiliary task is to improve accuracy on the supervised
task by uncovering hidden structures in the original data. All tasks, including
classiﬁcation, ranking and embedding, are trained by stochastic gradient
descent. The training cooperation between the main task and the auxiliary
task could be summaried as looping over two tasks:

(1) Select the next task.
(2) Select a random training example for this task.

(3) Update the MLP network parameters for this task by taking a gradient
step with respect to this example.

(4) Go to 1.

To give a concrete example, the pseudocode of multitasking with
‘embedding output’ case is given in Algorithm 1.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Experimental setting

When training the classiﬁcation model, negative (non-interacting)
examples are required. However, it is almost impossible to show
two proteins do not interact, a large set of non-interacting protein
pairs does not exist. A commonly applied strategy is to randomly
select protein pairs from all possible protein pairs as the negative
set, excluding those known interacting ones. Here, we exclude all
those pairs that are in NIAID database. For interacting pairs between
HIV-1 and human proteins, it is estimated that roughly only 1 in

about 100 possible pairs actually interacts (Tastan et al., 2009). This
is an extremely unbalanced ratio between positive and negative sets.
We use this ratio to build the negative set which includes ~ 16000
random negative pairs.

The positive pairs in our setting include only those PPIs pairs
conﬁrmed by the HIV-1 experts as ‘interacting’ (158 pairs). The
partial positive pairs (2119 left pairs of NIAID) function as auxillary
information in the training phase only.

The experimental evaluation is based on ﬁve folds cross-
validation (CV) with 20 randomly repeated CV runs to obtain
average performance scores. The reason we repeat cross-validation
runs is that randomness exists when sampling the negative training
set. To conquer this random effect, we pursued multiple CV
runs on multiple independently sampled negative sets. Averaged
performance scores are used for comparisons.

To measure the predictive power of SML for identifying protein
interactions between HIV-1 and Human, we compared three variants
of SML with two baseline classiﬁers. The SML models are named
as: (i) SMLC: SML with auxiliary classiﬁcation task; (ii) SMLR:
SML with auxiliary ranking task; (iii) SMLE: SML with embedding
on output space. Two baselines include: (i) RF: Random Forest;
(ii) MLP: Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Net. Three SML methods
and the MLP model are implemented using Torch 5 package (Weston
et al., 2008). Random Forest was from the Berkeley RF package
(Breiman, 2001).

4.2 Baselines to compare

Our task formulation is closely related to the framework of
supervised classiﬁcation of protein pairs through information
integration. Tastan et al. (2009) showed that RF give the state-of-art
performance for the HIV-1 to human PPI prediction task (though
partial labels ‘GroupI’ used as positive for training in that case).
Our SML models are built on MLP networks. Thus, it is worth to
compare and investigate how much improvement we could achieve
beyond the baselines: MLP network classiﬁer and the state-of-the-art
RF classiﬁer.

Moreover, we also evaluate the performance of both two base
classiﬁers when adding those partially labeled positive pairs into
the training positive (from experts). Ideally, these partial labels
should be weighted differently in the training compared to those
experts’ labels. But since partial positive pairs are associated with
different keywords in NIAID, it is tricky to select the weights. We
ﬁnally used a simple strategy in evaluation: just adding them as

training positive examples into the current positive set. Figure 3
summarized two ways we utilized in training baseline classiﬁers. For
the case in Figure 3b, two baselines are named as: (i) RF-P: Random
Forest adding partial positives in training; (ii) MLP-P: Multi-Layer
Perceptron Neural Net adding partial positives in training.

For each classiﬁer, parameter optimization was carried out
independently in identical cross-valiation fashion. Each method has
distinct sets of parameters to tune. For SMLE, we need to learn
the underline MLP network structure (hidden layer, hidden units,
etc.), the learning rate, choices of embedding pairs, ratio between
embedding and classiﬁcation during the joint training. For SMLC,
we need to learn the underline MLP network structure, ratio between
the main classiﬁcation and the pseudo classiﬁcation, and the learning
rate. For SMLR, we need to learn the underline MLP network
structure, ratio between the main classiﬁcation and the pseudo
ranking, the learning rate and the choices of pairwise ranking pairs.
To avoid overﬁtting, we did not try very deep MLP architecture. Thus
either linear (if possible) or adding one hidden layer was tried for
MLP architecture. The best parameters found for the classiﬁcation
auxiliar model is with one hidden layer, 15 hidden units and learning
rate 0.005. For the ranking model, the best setup is with linear layer
with learning rate 0.01. For the SML ‘embedding output’ model, the
choice is one hidden layer, ﬁve hidden units, learning rate 0.005 and
we train embedding with only the pushing apart step.

4.3 Evaluation metrics

When evaluating the performance of a classiﬁer on an imbalanced
test set such as is the case here, computing accuracy is not useﬁil
because a high true negative (TN) rate can easily be obtained
by chance. Therefore, we evaluated the quality of our predictive
model using four metrics which ignore the success on the TN
rate and summarize prediction performance over a range of output
thresholds. (i) Mean average precision (MAP) score is used to
summarize the precision recall curve and is the mean of the
average precision scores across recall levels. Precision refers to
the fraction of interacting pairs predicted by the classiﬁer that are
truly interacting (‘true positives’). Recall measures how many of
the known pairs of interacting proteins have been identiﬁed by the
learning model. (ii) Precision recall breakpoint (PRB) score is the
value of when precision is equal to recall across different cutoffs on
the predicted score. (iii) Receiver operator characteristic curves plot
the true positive rate against the false positive rate for different cut-
off values of the predicted score. The area under the ROC curve
(AUC) is commonly used as a summary measure of diagnostic
accuracy. (iv) R50 is a partial AUC score that measures the area
under the ROC curve until reaching 50 negative predictions, e.g.
low false positive rate. For our prediction task where classes are
extremely unbalanced, we are predominantly concerned with the
condition where false positive rate is low.

All these score range between 0 and 1, where values close to 1
indicates more successful predictions.

4.4 Performance

Table 2 compares three proposed SML models and two baseline
classiﬁers (each have two cases of training) using AUC R50, MAP,
PRB and AUC scores. The scores are averaged from 20 randomly
repeated 5-folds CV runs.

embedding on output; RF, Random Forest; MLP, Multi-Layer Perceptron Net. RF-P,
RF adding partial positive; MLP-P, MLP adding partial positive. Bold values gives the
best performance in the column.

For two baselines, the second type of training (adding partial
labels in) achieves better performance than the regular training,
which is not surprising. MLP model (MAP-P 0.21) makes
comparable performance to the state-of—the-art RF (MAP 0.213)
model.

All SML models perform better than baseline strategies (the best
MAP achieves 0.277, e.g. about 0.06 better than RF-P; the best
R50 gets 0.310, about 0.08 better than RF-P). This is expected
since our partial positive examples are associated with keywords
describing PPIs. SML auxiliary tasks tried to capture the intrinsic
patterns underlying these weak labels, from either labels themselves,
or their pairwise relationships with other examples. Multi-tasking
with MLP improve the performance compared to MLP alone. We
conclude that SML achieves the state-of-art performance on the task
of predicting interactions between HIV-1 and human protein.

Among three SML models, the SMLR—‘ranking’ and SMLE—
‘embedding on output’ task seem to capture the patterns of
partial labels better compared SMLC—‘classiﬁcation’. We think
this observation makes sense since essentially the only reliable
assumption we could derive from weak positive labels is ‘partial
positives are more likely to be interacting than negative random
pairs’. The ranking auxiliar task—SMLR performed training on this
assumption exactly, which achieved the best R50 (0.310) and the
best AUC (0.919) scores. Under the best parameter setup (learned
by CV), the ‘embedding output’—SMLE task is similar to SMLR
where it tried to push the network output value of partial positives
apart from the output of random negatives. This achieved the best
MAP (0.277, about 0.067 increase to RF-P) and the best PRB
(0.326, about 0.045 increase to RF-P) scores. SMLC model could
not capture this assumption directly, consequently resulting in less
improvement from multi-tasking.

Furthermore, we tried to compare SML models directly with
previous results in Tastan et al. (2009). Our current ‘gold standard’
positive set uses the 158 experts annotated interactions between
HIV-1 and human proteins. Differently, (Tastan et al., 2009) used 955
‘GroupI’ pairs as training positive. We tried to apply SMLR model
on the same supervised PPI prediction runs in Tastan et al. (2009)
and multi-task with the ranking task using ‘GroupII’ 1665 pairs as
partially labeled examples. This model gets an averaged 0.253 MAP
score and RF achieved 0.230 MAP score in Tastan et al. (2009). The
improvement is less impressive in this setting and we guess this is
because ‘GroupII’ set is not much larger than‘GroupI’ set.

4.5 Validation

A ﬁnal model was trained with all available expert labeled
interactions using the best parameter setting we found for SMLE.
Since randomness exists when sampling the negative training set, we
utilized multiple independently sampled negative sets to overcome
this random effect and to reduce the potential bias inherent in using
a single training set. Through bagging models trained with ﬁve
randomly sampled negative sets, our ﬁnal score is obtained through
value averaging. We then ranked all HIV-1 to human protein pairs
according to their classiﬁcation score. The derived ranked order list
were thresholded and the top ranked 2500 pairs build our list of
predicted PPIs. This list is downloadable from our supplementary
web.

Following Tastan et al. (2009), we carry two validations by
checking whether the human proteins reported in the ﬁinctional
siRNA screen are ranked high in our predicted list. The siRNA
screen identiﬁed 282 human genes to have an effect on HIV-1
infection (Brass et al., 2008). Also we check the human proteins
in our top ranked PPI list, whether they have been detected in
Virion (Ott, 2008) or not. This ﬁinctional assay found that 316
human proteins are highjacked by HIV-1 in its Virion. The predicted
pairs that involve with the Virion related human genes would be
of great interest to HIV-1 virologists. Table 3 gives the statistics of
overlapps between our predicted human partners to proteins found in
the two reported ﬁinctional screens. Clearly, there is a good portion
of predictions conﬁrmed by these functional screens. Recently, three
other functional screened human gene lists (Konig et al., 2008;
Yeung et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2008) related to HIV-1 become
available online. We combine these three human gene lists with
the one in Brass et al. (2008) to form a combined list called as
‘CombineFourSiRNA’ in Table 3. We then check the overlap of this
combined list to our top predicted human protein partners. The last
column in Table 3 describes that nearly 10% predicted partners are
validated by four siRNA screens, which gives strong indications of
how good our predictions are.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Supervised learning methods have been used for the task of
classifying pairs of proteins as interacting or not. However their
performance is restricted by the availability of labeled training
examples, i.e. known PPIs. In many cases, there exist considerable
amount of protein pairs, where an association is proposed in the
literature but not enough experimental evidence is available to
determine the existence of a direct interaction. Such is the case for
the task of predicting human to HIV-1 inter-species interactome.

In this article, we designed a semi-supervised multi-task learning
framework to integrate a larger set of potentially interacting protein
pairs retrieved from literature (weak labels) and a smaller set of

interactions annotated by experts. The proposed SML combine a
semi-supervised auxiliary task with a supervised PPI classiﬁer. A
multi-layer perceptron network is trained for PPI classiﬁcation on
labeled examples. Simultaneously, we multi-task this network with
an auxiliary task which aims to use weak positive labels to improve
the supervised classiﬁcation. Three auxiliary strategies are evaluated
on the task of predicting interactions between HIV-1 and human
proteins. Through CV, our method was shown to improve upon the
best previous method for this task indicating the beneﬁts of multi-
tasking with auxiliary information.

In addition to improved performance on inferring human HIV-1
PPIs, the proposed SML structure provides a ﬂexible framework
for general computational PPI prediction tasks. SML models could
be easily extended to other species or pairs of species, or to
incorporate other auxiliary information, such as other kinds of
weak labels or supporting information between unlabeled protein
pairs. For instance, the noisy interaction pairs from high throughput
experiments in human could be used to build neighbor pairs for
training SML model (e.g. embedding on output) very naturally
and thus the method has signiﬁcant potential for intra-species PPI
predictions such as in human.

Abstract

Motivation: The importance of testing associations allowing for interactions has been demon—
strated by Marchini et al. (2005). A fast method detecting associations allowing for interactions has
been proposed by Wan et al. (2010a). The method is based on likelihood ratio test with the assump—
tion that the statistic follows the 12 distribution. Many single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pairs
with significant associations allowing for interactions have been detected using their method.
However, the assumption of 12 test requires the expected values in each cell of the contingency
table to be at least five. This assumption is violated in some identified SNP pairs. In this case, likeli—
hood ratio test may not be applicable any more. Permutation test is an ideal approach to checking
the P—values calculated in likelihood ratio test because of its non—parametric nature. The P—values of
SNP pairs having significant associations with disease are always extremely small. Thus, we need
a huge number of permutations to achieve correspondingly high resolution for the P—values. In
order to investigate whether the P—values from likelihood ratio tests are reliable, a fast permutation
tool to accomplish large number of permutations is desirable.

Results: We developed a permutation tool named PBOOST. It is based on GPU with highly reliable
P—value estimation. By using simulation data, we found that the P—values from likelihood ratio tests
will have relative error of >100% when 50% cells in the contingency table have expected count less
than five or when there is zero expected count in any of the contingency table cells. In terms of
speed, PBOOST completed 107 permutations for a single SNP pair from the Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium (WTCCC) genome data (Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007)
within 1 min on a single Nvidia Tesla M2090 device, while it took 60 min in a single CPU Intel Xeon
E5—2650 to finish the same task. More importantly, when simultaneously testing 256 SNP pairs for
107 permutations, our tool took only 5min, while the CPU program took 10 h. By permuting on a
GPU cluster consisting of 40 nodes, we completed 1012 permutations for all 280 SNP pairs reported
with P—values smaller than 1.6 x 10’12 in the WTCCC datasets in 1 week.

3 Discussion

PBOOST makes it possible to test associations allowing for inter—
actions using permutation. The empirical rule requiring that no
>20% cells having expected count less than five is conservative. It
can be relaxed to that <50% cells having expected count less than
five and no cell having zero expected count. In this article, we only
focused on the identified SNP pairs. In fact, there are a lot more
non—significant SNP pairs (3.7 X 109 in Type—I diabetes dataset)
which also violate the above rule. Some of them might be significant.
Testing these SNP pairs remains an open challenge.

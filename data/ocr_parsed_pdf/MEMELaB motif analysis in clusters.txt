ABSTRACT

Summary: Genome-wide expression analysis can result in large num-
bers of clusters of co-expressed genes. Although there are tools for
ab initio discovery of transcription factor-binding sites, most do not
provide a quick and easy way to study large numbers of clusters. To
address this, we introduce a web tool called MEME-LaB. The tool
wraps MEME (an ab initio motif finder), providing an interface for
users to input multiple gene clusters, retrieve promoter sequences,
run motif finding and then easily browse and condense the results,
facilitating better interpretation of the results from large-scale
datasets.

Availability: MEME-LaB is freely accessible at: http://wsbc.warwick.

1 INTRODUCTION

Analyzing microarray expression data using cluster analysis is a
common and frequently performed task in functional genomics.
Typically, a large number of clusters are produced, each contain-
ing a large number of genes (e. g. 50 clusters of 200 genes). Each
cluster is predicted to contain a set of genes that are co—expressed
and as such would be expected to share common regulatory
features, such as transcription factor-binding sites (TFBSs).
There are established methods and tools for predicting known
TFBSs (such as Athena, O’Connor et al., 2005), but ab initio
motif discovery remains an important aspect to consider.
Several tools exist to perform this task, and MEME in particular
is a well-recognized suite for motif discovery (Bailey et al., 2006),
but the MEME web suite offers limited usage on large numbers
of clusters and subsequent navigation and post-processing of the
results. Machanick and Bailey (2012) provide a web tool
(MEME-ChIP) that is speciﬁcally tailored towards ChIP—seq
data, providing a useful expansion in MEME’s functionality.
Here, we describe a web tool called MEME-LaB (MEME
Launcher and Browser), which wraps the MEME tool in ways
that are ideally suited to the task of ab initio motif finding in

co-expressed gene clusters: (i) users can input multiple gene clus-
ters at once. (ii) Promoter sequences are automatically retrieved
from a local database or from a user-speciﬁed ﬁle. (iii) MEME is
run on all clusters simultaneously, and the results are presented
in a condensed and navigable format. (iv) Identiﬁed motifs are
compared for similarity with known TFBS motifs.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 General workﬂow

The MEME-LaB web service is designed to simplify the task of
identifying putative TFBSs in the promoters of co-expressed
gene clusters, and it provides an easy way to navigate through
and filter the results.

2.2 Input

Users are not required to register for the service and are auto-
matically logged in as a guest user. Gene clusters are uploaded as
a simple tab-separated file consisting of two columns: the first for
numbers identifying the clusters, and the second for gene IDs.
For the Arabidopsis genome, sequences will be automatically
retrieved from a local database; for all other genomes, a
second ﬁle containing promoter sequences in FASTA format is
uploaded by the user.

2.3 Processing

Uploaded ﬁles are veriﬁed for validity, and the user warned of
any detected errors in the input. Users specify the minimum and
maximum length of promoter regions to search, between 50 and
1000 nt in length, and optionally to stop at a neighbouring gene if
there is one present in this region. Users select the number of
motifs to ﬁnd per cluster, within a minimum and maximum
motif length ($20 nt). Details of comparisons with known
motifs from JASPAR (Bryne et al., 2008) and PLACE (Higo
et al., 1999) are provided in the output (users with a valid
login for TRANSFAC can also compare motifs with
TRANSFAC motifs on our server). An email is sent to the ad-
dress provided notifying when the job is complete and results
ready for retrieval.

2.4 Output

Results are provided as interactive html pages, and they can also
be downloaded. For each cluster, the speciﬁed number of motifs
is identiﬁed using the MEME algorithm and displayed as motif
logos. Additional information for each motif is displayed,

Fig. 1. Screenshot of a typical MEME-LaB result. Motifs are displayed as motif logos, and information about each motif is shown (A). Results can be
ﬁltered on motif properties (B). Additional information on positional distribution (C) and properties of similar motifs (D) are accessed in pop-up

windows

including its distribution among the input set, positional bias,
strand bias and similarity to known motifs.

3 EXAMPLE RESULTS

We demonstrate the functionality offered by MEME-LaB, using
co-expression clusters derived from a time-course microarray ex-
periment of Arabidopsis responses to infection with Botrytis
cinerea (Windram et al., 2012) (input ﬁles and the complete re-
sults are available as Supplementary Data S1). The usefulness of
the tool is demonstrated by being able to easily browse motifs for
all clusters on a single webpage and to reduce a large set of
motifs to the most informative results based on motif properties
(Fig. 1A and B). Additional information on each motifs pos-
itional distribution among the input set is provided (Fig. 1C).
For each ab initio motif predicted, up to ﬁve of the most similar
known motifs are listed, with a distance measure, and additional
information and links are provided (Fig. 1A and D). In the ex-
ample result View (Fig. 1), ﬁltering to show only motifs that
occur in 25% or more of sequences in a cluster, occurring in
320 sites and have an information content >10 has resulted in
21 of the possible 220 motifs being displayed. MEME identiﬁed
motifs similar to I-box (Fig. 1A, top) and G—box (Fig. 1A,
bottom), which are consistent with previous findings, but also
a third motif (Fig. 1A, middle) that is not closely similar to any
known motif but is present in all the sequences in cluster 4.

The MEME-LaB service makes existing functionality more
widely and more easily applicable, enabling the identiﬁcation
of signiﬁcant motifs in large co-expression cluster datasets.

ABSTRACT

Summary: 1SC flux analysis studies have become an essential com-
ponent of metabolic engineering research. The scope of these studies
has gradually expanded to include both isotopically steady-state and
transient labeling experiments, the latter of which are uniquely applic-
able to photosynthetic organisms and slow-to-label mammalian cell
cultures. Isotopomer network compartmental analysis (INCA) is the
first publicly available software package that can perform both
steady-state metabolic flux analysis and isotopically non-stationary
metabolic flux analysis. The software provides a framework for com-
prehensive analysis of metabolic networks using mass balances and
elementary metabolite unit balances. The generation of balance equa-
tions and their computational solution is completely automated and
can be performed on networks of arbitrary complexity.

1 INTRODUCTION

13C metabolic ﬂux analysis (13C MFA) has emerged over the past
20 years as an important approach to assess in vivo metabolic
phenotypes (Sauer, 2006; Wiechert, 2001). It relies on least-s-
quares regression of isotope labeling measurements and extracel-
lular exchange rates to reconstruct comprehensive ﬂux maps that
depict the flow of carbon throughout intracellular metabolism.
The models applied to the data regression comprise mass bal-
ances and isotopomer balances on all internal nodes of the meta-
bolic network and can often involve many thousands
of equations. Several publicly available software packages have
been developed to facilitate model generation and computa-
tional analysis of steady-state isotope labeling experiments
(ILEs): 13CFLUX2 (Weitzel et al., 2013), FiatFlux (Zamboni
et al., 2005), Metran Woo et al., 2008), OpenFLUX (Quek
et al., 2009), FIA (Srour et al., 2011) and influx_s (Sokol et al.,
2012), to name a few. However, none of these packages are cap-
able of simulating transient ILEs wherein 13C labeling measure-
ments are collected before reaching isotopic steady state. This
requires so-called isotopically non-stationary MFA (INST-
MFA) methods, where the isotopomer balances are described
by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) rather
than algebraic equations (W iechert and Noh, 2005).

Because of the growing prevalence of INST-MFA and the lack
of publicly available software tools to facilitate its application,
we have developed a MATLAB-based software package called
INCA (isotopomer network compartmental analysis) that is
capable of both steady-state MFA and INST-MFA calculations.
As the name implies, the INCA modeling approach is a nat-
ural extension of the well-known compartmental modeling
approaches that have been used for many years to assess
the ﬂow of radioactive tracers within biological networks.
However, unlike those previous radiotracer models, INCA is
able to describe the full isotopomer distributions of measured
metabolites and is therefore capable of distinguishing flux con-
tributions from different metabolic pathways based on the
atomic rearrangements they produce.

2 PROGRAM USAGE

A graphical user interface allows the user to input reaction in-
formation and experimental data to the program, while offering
a variety of powerful analysis tools to design and interpret ILEs
(Fig. 1). All INCA data structures can be loaded and manipu-
lated from the MATLAB command line, and driver routines can
be called directly or invoked within custom MATLAB scripts.
INCA also offers built-in parallelization capabilities for running
compute-intensive functions within a distributed computing
environment. All program features are fully documented in a
60-page user manual, which addresses several advanced model-
ing topics. Two preconfigured example networks are also
provided with INCA.

3 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

3.1 Network speciﬁcation

INCA applies steady-state mass balances and either steady-state
or transient elementary metabolite unit (EMU) balances to simu-
late ILEs. The balance equations for any user-speciﬁed reaction
network are generated based on reaction stoichiometry, com-
partmentation, reversibility and atom transition information
that can be supplied in a simple text format: e.g. ‘A (abc) =>
B (ab)+C (c)’. INCA can simultaneously trace multiple atom
types (e. g. C, H) and can properly account for metabolite sym-
metry and atom equivalency based on user input (Antoniewicz
et al., 2007). The resulting network model can be saved in binary
format or exported to other text formats such as FluxML
(Weitzel et al., 2013) or OpenFLUX-compatible FTBL (Quek

et al., 2009). Whenever an initial ﬂux distribution is supplied by
the user or subsequently modiﬁed, INCA checks the mass bal-
ances for consistency and updates the ﬂux values, if necessary, to
preserve mass conservation.

Solution of steady-state EMU balances is accomplished
using a QR decomposition of the state-transition matrix of
each decoupled linear subsystem, followed by matrix inversion
(Antoniewicz et al., 2007). Transient EMU balances are inte-
grated using a custom linear ODE solver that involves comput-
ing the matrix exponential of each state-transition matrix
Woung et al., 2008). Integration tolerances and time-step con-
trols can be adjusted by the user to achieve the desired accuracy
and time resolution. It is also possible to apply quasiisteady-
state assumptions to selected metabolite nodes during the ODE
integration. This will force the labeling at these nodes to respond
instantaneously to changes in the labeling of precursor metabol-
ites, such that local isotopic equilibrium is maintained.

3.2 Network analysis and simulation

INCA provides several analysis routines that can be used to
assess metabolic network properties and to design ILEs, even
before supplying experimental inputs. First, there are built-in
constraint-based analysis methods that can be applied to the
user-speciﬁed reaction network (Palsson, 2006): ﬂux balance ana-
lysis, minimization of metabolic adjustment, flux variability ana-
lysis, flux coupling finder, robustness analysis and phenotype
phase plane analysis. Second, INCA can perform either steady-
state or transient simulations of isotopomer distributions based
on user-speciﬁed tracer inputs and initial ﬂux and pool size esti-
mates. This is an important tool for identifying optimal tracers,
measurements and sampling time points before initiating experi-
ments. Third, INCA is capable of implementing the optimal
experiment design approach of Mollney et a]. (1999) to compre-
hensively search for tracer combinations that maximize param-
eter identiﬁability.

3.3 Experimental data input

When performing 13C MFA, ﬂuxes are estimated by minimizing
the difference between simulated and experimental measure-
ments. This requires speciﬁcation of (i) ﬂux measurements, (ii)
isotope labeling measurements and (iii) isotope tracers to the
program. When performing INST-MFA, the user can also spe-
cify pool size measurements. One powerful feature of INCA is
that it allows multiple experiments to be regressed simultan-
eously to generate a single ﬂux map. This can be of interest
when ﬁtting several replicate experiments or parallel labeling ex-
periments with different tracers. Currently, INCA only supports
mass isotopomer distribution data or 1H-NMR fractional en-
richment data. The ability to specify 13C-NMR fine spectra or
tandem MS/MS data to the program is anticipated in a future

release. Steady-state or transient isotopomer measurements can
be entered directly to the graphical user interface, imported from
an Excel spreadsheet or imported from other previously saved
INCA models. INCA can accept any combination of tracer
atoms, including mixtures of different tracers (e.g. 2H and 13C)
or tracers with mass shifts >1 (e. g. 180).

3.4 Metabolic ﬂux analysis

Once the metabolic network and experimental inputs have been
speciﬁed, INCA can perform MFA calculations by minimizing
the sum-of-squared residuals (SSR) between simulated and
experimental measurements (Wiechert, 2001). A Levenbergi
Marquardt gradient-based search algorithm is applied to minim-
ize the SSR by adjusting the free ﬂux and pool size parameters.
An active set method is applied to handle the linear inequality
constraints on the adjustable parameters (Gill et al., 1981). The
sensitivity equations required to estimate the Hessian matrix and
gradient vector of the SSR with respect to the fitted parameters
are automatically generated and solved in tandem with the EMU
balances. The search can be initialized with user-speciﬁed par-
ameter estimates, or these values can be randomized to minimize
user bias. To increase the odds of finding a global optimum
solution, a ‘multistart’ approach can be used to repeat the par-
ameter search from multiple random initial guesses.

When flux estimation is completed, INCA automatically pro-
vides several statistical metrics that can be used to assess good-
ness-of-fit and to diagnose the source of any mismatch between
simulated and experimental measurements. Local estimates of
uncertainty are obtained from the diagonal elements of the par-
ameter covariance matrix (Antoniewicz et al., 2006). To obtain a
more accurate estimate of parameter uncertainties, INCA can
perform either parameter continuation or Monte Carlo analysis
to calculate conﬁdence intervals. Parameter continuation is per-
formed using a method similar to Antoniewicz et a]. (2006);
however, INCA applies ﬂux coupling analysis and a predictor-
corrector method to minimize computational expense. INCA is
also capable of computing conﬁdence intervals using Monte
Carlo analysis as an alternative to parameter continuation.

Although there is no explicit limit on the size of the network
that can be modeled using INCA, memory usage and computa-
tional run times can be considerable when performing INST-
MFA with large networks. The following run times were
obtained for an Escherichia coli example network Woung
et al., 2008) with 92 ﬂuxes (35 free) and 66 metabolite pools
(46 free) on a Dell OptiPlex 790 computer (Rocks 6.0, Intel
Core i7 2600 processor, 4 GB memory): <1 s for tracer simula-
tion, ~10 min for ﬂux estimation (starting from a random initial
guess) and ~1h/parameter for calculation of 95% conﬁdence
intervals using the continuation approach. However, INCA’s
parallelization capabilities can be leveraged to minimize the
total time required for multistart MFA and conﬁdence interval
calculations.

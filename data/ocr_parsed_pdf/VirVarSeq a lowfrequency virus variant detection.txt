its weakness in the detection of low—frequency variants (Prosperi
et al., 2013), whereas the latter is our main interest. Instead, we
prefer to call variants within the read length to avoid challenges
encountered in the haplotype reconstruction. On the other hand,
linkage between the nucleotides is lost when calling variants at
the SNP level. In this contribution, we introduce a novel strategy
for calling variants at the codon level (nucleotide triplets), which
facilitates immediate biological interpretations, particularly in
virology applications where drug target regions are of interest.

In this article, we present an innovative approach for variant
calling at the codon level, named Q—cpileup, that reduces
the number of false—positive ﬁndings by exploiting the Qs
of the nucleotides generated by sequencing. Our thresholding
strategy is adaptive to provide an optimized threshold for
individual samples in each sequencing run. Q—cpileup
is imbedded in a pipeline, called VirVarSeq, which starts from
fastq files.

2 METHODS

Several samples were sequenced using Illumina’s genome analyzer (GA)
IIx according to manufacturing protocols (see Supplementary Material).
The VirVarSeq pipeline proceeds as follows:

(1) The sequenced reads are aligned against a reference sequence using
the Burrows7Wheeler aligner tool (Li and Durbin, 2009).

(2) Based on this alignment, a consensus sequence is deﬁned.

(3) A realignment is performed against this consensus. This strategy
of iterative mapping will increase coverage, especially in samples
where the consensus strongly deviates from the reference
(see Supplementary Fig. S1).

(4) After alignment, Q-cpileup is executed, which consists of a three-
step analysis:

(a) In the ﬁrst step, the Qs of the codons in the reading frame
of interest are retrieved.

(b) Next, the threshold is determined dependent on the quality
of the run.

(c) Finally, the ﬁltered codon table is constructed.

The VirVarSeq pipeline, which runs from fastq to the ﬁltered codon
table, is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtools/?source= dir-
ectory together with a user’s guide (see Supplementary Material 2).
All reads containing indel errors are removed before running Q-cpileup.
It is hereby assumed that indels will result in non-viable virus. In some
rare occasions, however, there might be an insertion mutation at the
codon level, which can be investigated in a separate analysis (see indel
Table Supplementary Material). Below, the different steps from
Q-cpileup will be explained in more detail.

2.1 Quality of codons

A pileup of read bases is generated using the alignments to a consensus
sequence. In analogy with mpileup of samtools, for which the base-pair
information at each reference position is described, cpileup describes the
codon information at each amino acid position of the reference genome.
For each position in the reference genome, the different codons are
reported together with one Q for each codon. This requires that the
Qs of the three nucleotides within a codon have to be summarized.
A comparative analysis of different summarizations revealed that the
weakest link, i.e. minimum Q of the three nucleotides in the codon,
provided the best separation between low- and high-quality codons

Notex. The different codons observed in a sample are counted at each codon
position of the reference genome and their frequencies are calculated using the cover—
age at that particular position. The Qs are summarized by averaging the minimum
Qs of the codons. Position: amino acid position of the reference. Ref: codon of
the reference genome at a particular position. Codon: codon present in a sample
at a particular position. Count: the number of times a particular codon occurs in the
cpileup at a particular position. Coverage: the number of reads that fully cover
a particular codon position. Frequency: Count/Coverage. Mean: Average of the
minimum Qs of a particular codon at a particular position.

(see Supplementary Fig. S2). This minimum Q represents the codon’s
nucleotide with the highest probability of being a sequencing error.
A codon table is built based on the pileup where for each codon
position of the reference the different codons within a sample are
reported together with their frequency (Table 1). The minimum Qs
of the codons at a particular position are averaged to give a rough
idea about the overall quality. However, the individual minimum Qs
of the codons themselves is used in subsequent analyses.

2.2 Q-intersection threshold

The distribution of the minimum Qs was checked and compared for
one particular sample sequenced in two different runs and three
different lanes reaching an average coverage of around 30000
(Fig. 1). The shape of the distributions can be approximated by a
mixture distribution with three truncated normal components
(see Supplementary Material for model selection and goodness of ﬁt
in Supplementary Fig. S3). Truncation is performed at the lower and
upper ends of the Q range. The ﬁrst mode represents a point prob-
ability at Q 2, which is the lowest Illumina Q. This is due to an artifact
created by Illumina’s base caller. Read ends with a segment of mostly
low quality (5Q15) are given a Q of 2. The second component distri-
bution is a distribution of low Qs, reﬂecting the sequencing error dis-
tribution. Finally, the highest mode, close to 40, originates from a
distribution of reliable calls. Note that the mixture of three normal
components for the errors and reliable calls should be considered
only as a working assumption and that neither trimming nor ﬁltering
of the data is required before ﬁtting the mixture models. The expecta-
tion maximization (EM) algorithm of McLachlan (McLachlan and
Jones, 1988) will be applied for ﬁtting these normal mixture models.
We have written an R-wrapper to run the original Fortran code of
McLachlan, which is embedded in the pipeline VirVarSeq. The EM
algorithm was initialized by setting the three modes at 2, 10 and 35
and the variances at 0.8 for the point probability and 40 for the other
two distributions. The marginal error probability, the sum of mixing
proportion of the distributions at 2 and 10, was set to 15%.

The bulk of Qs was high, indicating a majority of reliable calls in the
dataset (green distribution in Fig. 1). At the other end, a clear point
probability at the Q of 2 was seen. The red distribution in Figure 1
corresponds to low-quality codons that are likely to be sequencing
errors. There are several criteria to deﬁne a threshold for ﬁltering the
low-quality codons and for distinguishing between errors and reliable

calls. An approach is chosen that is adaptive and robust. The intersection
point of the two component distributions was used and is referred to as
the Q-intersection threshold (QIT), which is indicated with vertical
dashed lines in Figure 1. The distribution of the minimum Qs of the
codons and hence the QIT varies between different runs for the same
sample, confirming the need for an adaptive filtering strategy.

2.3 Filtering of codon tables

Once the QIT is determined, an updated codon table can be constructed.
All codons with a minimum Q below the threshold will be filtered from
the analysis. The inﬂuence of trimming is negligible, as it mainly affects
low-quality nucleotides, which are removed by the filter. The three-step
analysis returns a codon table with different variants and their frequencies
at each codon position of the reference, which is robust to sequencing
errors.

sample, which was sequenced twice in the same run (run 1) but in differ-
ent lanes (lanes 1 and 2), and which was sequenced yet another time in
another run (run 2). The black line shows the overall fit of the mixture
distribution, which consists of the blue, the red and the green component
distributions. The blue and the red distributions correspond to codons
that likely result from sequencing errors, and the green distribution
represents reliable calls. The QIT is indicated with a vertical black
dashed line

3 RESULTS
3.1 HCV plasmid mixtures

To assess the ﬁltering accuracy of Q—cpileup, we made use of two
plasmids that carry HCV NS3 amino acids 1 to 181 and that
differ at only two codon positions, 36 and 155. The two plasmids
were mixed in four different proportionsil:10, 1:50, 1:100 and
1:20(Fand sequenced with average coverages of 96211, 81 179,
95 590 and 74 820, respectively (see Supplementary Material for
sample preparation; sequencing data are available at the
European Nucleotide Archive, accession number PRJEB5028).
A minor variant is deﬁned as a codon that differs from the con—
sensus. Hence, only two minor variants are expected at codon
positions 36 [GTC (consensus) —> ATG] and 155 [CGG (con—
sensus) —> AAA]; all others can be considered as false—positive
findings. For each of the four sequenced mixes, the QIT was
determined (Table 2). Comparison of the number of variants
when no filtering but trimming (QIT = 0) is applied and after
Q—cpileup reveals that adaptive quality filtering can reduce the
number of false—positive ﬁndings by 2(PSO% (third and fourth
columns of Table 2). With Q—cpileup, no false—positive findings
are reported with frequencies >1 %, a reporting limit deﬁned by
Thys et a]. (Manuscript under review). This is in strong contrast
with the 742% FDR without ﬁltering, for discoveries with fre—
quencies >1%. Q—cpileup is able to reduce the number of false—
positive findings while the frequencies of the true minor variants
(last columns of Table 2) remain unaltered.

The results for the mixing proportion of 1% are shown
in more detail in Figure 2. A QIT of 19 was used for ﬁltering
in this sample (Fig. 2a). In panel b, the codons equal to the
consensus (called major variants) are investigated before
(QIT = 0) and after ﬁltering (QIT = 19). The plasmid data
have only two real variants, meaning that the codons investi—
gated here should have frequencies close to 100%. After applying
Q—cpileup, the frequencies of the codons are indeed closer to 100,
indicating again that the number of false—positive findings
is reduced. The minor variants are compared in panel c.
Without ﬁltering, several minor variants are reported with fre—
quencies above the reporting limit of 1%. Their frequencies are
strongly reduced after filtering, while the estimates of the true
minor variant frequencies remain (red triangles). This suggests
again that Q filtering provides effective noise reduction while still
retaining the reliable calls at low frequency. Figure 2c reveals
that our new ﬁltering method allows for lowering the reporting

after Q-cpileup are indicated in gray at the bottom. Codons not detected
with 454 sequencing were indicated with red triangles and are likely to be
false-positive findings

3.4 Effect of inter-/intra—run variability on QIT

An equimolar pool of 42 clinical HCV samples was sequenced
three times to investigate the variability in sequencing quality
and hence the variability of the QIT. The 42 samples were
sequenced twice within the same run (R1) but on two different
lanes (L1 and L2), and they were all sequenced again in another
run (R2 L3). For one of these samples, the mixture distribution
of each of the three sequencing runs is shown in Figure 1. A clear
difference in quality between the runs is observed, resulting
in different QITs. Boxplots of the QITs of 42 samples for each
of the sequencing runs show that the inter—run variability
of the QIT is larger than the variability between lanes of the
same run (Fig. 4).

First, the effect of the intra—run variability of the QITs on the
ﬁnal codon table was investigated. The number of reported
codons with frequency >1% is plotted for both lanes in Figure
5a. In all, 74% of the samples report at most one additional
codon, depending on the lane on which it is sequenced.
The maximum difference in reported number of codons is
four. We further explored frequency differences for all codons.
The distribution of the differences in frequency between the two
lanes is plotted for each sample in Figure 5b. Overall,
the frequencies are similar with some deviations up to 3%.
These maxima, however, are mainly originating from codons
located in a GC—rich region, where a coverage drop is
observed. The sample where the maximum absolute difference
is observed (indicated in red) is investigated in detail in Figure 5c.

QIT

Fig. 4. Boxplot of the QITs of 42 clinical samples for each of the sequen-
cing runs denoted by run (R) and lane (L) to investigate inter- and intra-
run variability. The black boxplots are part of the intra-run comparison,
whereas the gray boxplot represents the QITs of the other run. The inter-
run variability is larger compared with the intra-run variability

The frequencies for all codons discovered on both lanes are
plotted against each other on the log scale. No substantial
differences can be observed at >1%. Finally, the maximum
differences, for each of the 42 samples, are reported on a relative
scale in Figure 5d. The sizes of the dots are scaled according to
the absolute frequency obtained in lane 1, which teaches
us that most deviations occur for frequencies >50%. Overall,
the reported variants and their frequencies are comparable
on both lanes after applying Q—cpileup, despite slightly
different QITs. This is in strong contrast with the raw data
(see in Supplementary Fig. S4). These raw data were only
trimmed, which is partially based on Qs. Without Q—cpileup,
the comparison of the samples sequenced on both lanes reveals
that (i) the number of reported variants differs up to 16 variants,
(ii) deviations of the frequencies go up to 6% and (iii) even for
the variants with frequency >1 %, some clear deviations between
the two lanes can be observed. This suggests that Q—cpileup is
able to reduce the number of false—positive findings while retain—
ing the true signal, and that the adaptive approach is able to
account for differences in quality between the lanes.

In the next step, the inter—run variability of the QITs was
investigated. The second run was a high—quality run with fewer
errors (Fig. 1 comparing run 1 lane 2 and run 2 lane 3). The
overall good quality in run 2 makes the estimation of the error
component of the mixture challenging and results in a large QIT.
The effect of these high QITs on the final codon table was inves—
tigated. The number of reported variants, with frequency >1%,
is again similar even after applying these high thresholds
(Fig. 6a). In all, 83% of the samples report at most one add—
itional variant, and only one sample reports four additional vari—
ants, which is again the maximum difference in reported number
of variants. The distribution of the frequency differences remains
small overall, but the maximum difference in frequency as well as
the relative change for these maxima rises (Fig. 6b and d).

each of the 42 samples. For each of the samples, 75% of the codons show
differences in frequencies close to zero, whereas the upper whiskers range

depending on the lane where the sample was sequenced. (c) Comparison of
all codon frequencies on the log scale between two lanes for the sample
where the maximum frequency difference is observed. The frequencies of
codons not present in the other lane are plotted in gray. ((1) Relative change
for codons with maximum absolute difference plotted for each sample.
The relative change is calculated as [x 1 7x2]/x2 with x1 and x2 the codon
frequencies for lane 1 and lane 2, respectively (sample with the maximum
absolute difference in red). The sizes of the dots are scaled according to the
estimated frequency in lane 1, indicating that most maximum differences
occur at higher frequencies

But these maxima occur again at rather high frequencies.
When focusing on a particular sample, high QITs seem to have
no negative impact on the ﬁnal codon table (Fig. 6c). Despite
the questionable working assumption that the second component
separates the error distribution from the distribution of the
reliable calls, the resulting QITs provide reliable codon tables.
Hence, our ﬁltering approach seems robust to deviations from
the working assumption. Q—cpileup is adaptive and thereby can
cope with differences in quality between runs.

3.5 Robustness of the method

Approximately 400 samples, from both HCV— and HIV—infected
subjects, were sequenced in seven different runs and analyzed
with Q—cpileup. Some examples of the HCV results are displayed
in Figures 3 and 5. The sequenced amplicons of HCV samples
cover GC—rich regions. It is known that Illumina is error prone
in these regions (Dohm et al., 2008). This is reﬂected in the
distribution of the minimum Qs where more low values are
observed than with amplicons of HIV samples for which no

differ between the two lanes. (b) Boxplots of differences in codon
frequency between two runs for each of the 42 samples. For each
sample, 75% of the codons show differences in frequencies close to

sample was sequenced. (c) Comparison of all codon frequencies on the
log scale between the two runs for the sample where the maximum fre-
quency difference is observed. The frequencies of variants that are absent
in the other run are plotted in gray. ((1) Relative change for codons with
maximum absolute frequency difference is plotted for each sample and
scaled according to the estimated frequency in condition 2. The relative
change is calculated as [x27x3]/x3 with x2 and x3 the codon frequencies for
run 1 lane 2 and run 2 lane 3, respectively (sample with maximum dif-
ference is indicated in red). The sizes of the dots are scaled according to
the estimated frequency in run 1, indicating that most maximum differ-
ences occur at higher frequencies

GC—rich regions were covered (Supplementary Fig. SS).
It is especially in these GC—rich regions where you expect that
false—positive ﬁndings exist with frequencies >1% as seen in
Figure 3b on the x—axis. When applying Q—cpileup, the frequen—
cies of these false—positive findings could be reduced.
In Supplementary Figure SS, we illustrate that the proposed
strategy also similarly reduces the noise for HIV samples.
Although this new variant calling tool was primarily
developed based on Illumina’s GAIIx sequencing data, it can
also be a valuable tool for other Illumina sequencing platforms,
such as HiSeq. HiSeq uses the same sequencing—by—synthesis
technique and suffers from the same error types (Minoche
et al., 2011). HiSeq data, analyzed with Q—cpileup, are
presented in Supplementary Figure S6. The tool, however, is
not applicable for pyrosequencing techniques, such as Roche
454. Their Qs do not reﬂect substitution error probabilities
but probabilities of calling homopolymers of particular
length (De Beuf et al., 2012). For these types of data, the tool

can, however, still generate a codon table, but no threshold
determination or QIT—based filtering should be applied.

4 DISCUSSION

Many sequence variant identiﬁcation tools have been described
in literature to call variants at the SNP level. Most approaches
are tailored to call SNPs in human resequencing projects
(Nielsen et al., 2011) where SNPs can be either heterologous
(50%) or homologous (100%). However, in viral deep sequen—
cing projects, the SNP frequency can vary between 100% and
0%, whereas SNPs present in <1% of the reads also may be
of interest. Further, our main focus is the detection of drug—
resistant variants for which a speciﬁc drug—target region has to
be investigated. Hence, it would be beneﬁcial to report variants
at the codon level per amino acid position to enable an immedi—
ate biological interpretation of the variants with respect to their
antiviral drug responses. Variant calling tools used by the virolo—
gists in this research field are either not fully described in—house
tools (Noguera—Julian et al., 2013) or build based on SNPs
(Parameswaran et al., 2012) at the DNA or RNA level only.
In the latter case, one needs to retrieve the linkage information
between the neighboring nucleotides to deduce effects at the
coded amino acid level. This process is not always straightfor—
ward. Some of the variant callers developed for viral population
sequencing have add—on tools, like V—profiler (Henn et al., 2012)
for V—phaser (Macalalad et al., 2012), to convert the list of SNPs
to a list of codon variants. However, these are mainly developed
for 454 data. None of the available tools reports the variants
immediately at the codon level. Therefore, Q—cpileup was initially
developed and imbedded in a pipeline. By taking the weakest link
as a representative for the quality of the codon, the filtering
remains at the individual nucleotide level but reporting is done
at the codon level. The approach is adaptive to allow for differ—
ences in quality between the runs.

The intersection point between the distributions of the errors
and reliable calls is suggested as a threshold (QIT). However,
other criteria could also be considered. For instance, the
number of false discoveries can be controlled by deﬁning
the QIT as a certain quantile of the reliable call component
distribution. By using the 5% quantile as a QIT, 5% of the
codons, which are truly present in the population, are falsely
considered as being errors. This statement relies heavily on the
interpretation of the distributions as errors and reliable calls.
However, the three—component mixture distribution should
be considered only as a working assumption. Moreover, it is
impossible to check the actual interpretation of the mixture
distributions. Hence, the interpretation of the different compo—
nents as error and reliable calls cannot always be warranted,
particularly when low Qs are underrepresented. Therefore,
we advise users to assess the distribution plots as diagnostic
tools to critically judge whether the chosen threshold is accept—
able and/or meaningful.

Instead of applying hard filtering with a QIT, as suggested
in this article, the posterior probabilities of the reliable call dis—
tribution could be used. The counts of a codon at a particular
position can be weighted with these probabilities. By doing so,
codons with a low Q will have a low contribution in the final
frequency estimates. Hence, data are not ﬁltered but weighted

with the probabilities of being truly present in the reliable codon
population. This method also relies on the interpretation of the
different component distributions as error distribution and reli—
able call distribution.

Importantly, we have shown that the filtering strategy using
hard threshold QIT is robust to runs where the distributions
deviate from the working assumption. The impact on the final
codon table frequencies was minimal. Overall, our proposed ﬁl—
tering strategy controls the false—positive rate at reasonable levels
with no false discoveries above a reporting limit of 1%. The noise
is effectively reduced while retaining the reliable calls even at low
frequency. This suggests that the reporting limit of detection at
1% could be lowered, although distinguishing true variants from
error at 0.5% remains challenging. Depending on the risk one is
willing to take to include a small number of false—positive find—
ings, either one of the cutoffs can be used. More importantly,
Q—cPileup shows a splendid sensitivity that could not be achieved
by the SNP callers while maintaining a good speciﬁcity for vari—
ants with frequencies down to 0.5%. This sensitivity will allow
further investigation of the reported variants above one of the
cutoffs deﬁned by the specificity to search for resistance—asso—
ciated mutations, or in the next step to monitor drug resistance
and guide treatment (Dierynck et al., submitted for publication).
Currently, the clinical cutoff is not yet defined for minority drug—
resistant virus variants, and it is still a subject of open debate
(Schneider et al., 2014). Some studies have found no significant
association between the presence of low—frequency variants and
subsequent virological failure, whereas others report clear correl—
ations (Vandenhende et al., 2014). The availability of methods
that detect low—frequency variants at the codon level with high
sensitivity and good speciﬁcity can help in deﬁning the clinical
beneﬁt of low—frequency resistance testing.

5 CONCLUSION

A variant calling tool is proposed for identifying true variants
at the codon level within a viral population using Illumina
sequencing. The variants are ﬁltered using base—calling Qs for
reducing false—positive ﬁndings. The lowest Q of the three
nucleotides of the codon is taken as representative for
the codon. An adaptive strategy is developed to provide an
optimized threshold for individual samples in each sequencing
run. The intersection point of the component distributions of the
mixture is suggested as a valuable threshold, QIT. Codons with
a Q below this threshold are not reported. The robustness against
deviations of the working assumption justiﬁes the utilities of our
method for low— and high—quality sequencing runs. It is shown
that the generated filtered codon table is reporting far fewer
false—positive findings compared with the codon table based
on the raw data. Moreover, VirVarSeq has a superb sensitivity
compared with existing SNP callers while maintaining a good
speciﬁcity for codon variants with frequencies down to 0.5%.
This suggests that the current reporting limit of detection
at 1% can even be lowered. The tool is implemented in a user—
friendly open—source pipeline, VirVarSeq, which allows
virologists to call variants at the codon level starting from the
fastq files.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein—RNA interactions play a key role in a number of
biological processes, such as protein synthesis, mRNA processing,
mRNA assembly, ribosome function and eukaryotic spliceosomes.
As a result, a reliable identification of RNA binding site of a protein
is important for functional annotation and site-directed mutagenesis.
Accumulated data of experimental protein—RNA interactions reveal
that a RNA binding residue with different neighbor amino acids often
exhibits different preferences for its RNA partners, which in turn can
be assessed by the interacting interdependence of the amino acid
fragment and RNA nucleotide.

Results: In this work, we propose a novel classification method
to identify the RNA binding sites in proteins by combining a new
interacting feature (interaction propensity) with other sequence-
and structure-based features. Specifically, the interaction propensity
represents a binding specificity of a protein residue to the interacting
RNA nucleotide by considering its two-side neighborhood in a protein
residue triplet. The sequence as well as the structure-based features
of the residues are combined together to discriminate the interaction
propensity of amino acids with RNA. We predict RNA interacting
residues in proteins by implementing a well-built random forest
classifier. The experiments show that our method is able to detect
the annotated protein—RNA interaction sites in a high accuracy. Our
method achieves an accuracy of 84.5%, F-measure of 0.85 and
AUC of 0.92 prediction of the RNA binding residues for a dataset
containing 205 non-homologous RNA binding proteins, and also
outperforms several existing RNA binding residue predictors, such
as RNABindR, BindN, RNAProB and PPRint, and some alternative
machine learning methods, such as support vector machine, naive
Bayes and neural network in the comparison study. Furthermore,
we provide some biological insights into the roles of sequences
and structures in protein—RNA interactions by both evaluating the
importance of features for their contributions in predictive accuracy
and analyzing the binding patterns of interacting residues.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNA undergoes diverse post-transcriptional regulation of gene
expression, including regulation of its transportation, localization
and decay (Glisovic et al., 2008). In many cases, such a process
occurs through elements on the RNA molecule that interact with
hundreds of RNA binding proteins existing in the cell (Lunde et al.,
2007). Interactions among proteins and RNA molecules play an
essential role in a variety of biological activities within a cell,
such as the post-transcriptional gene regulation, alternative splicing,
translation and infections by RNA viruses (Terribilini et al., 2006).
Therefore, it is important to understand the principle of protein—
RNA interactions and identify their interaction sites when selecting
activators and inhibitors in rational drug design. It is commonly
believed that RNA recognition by proteins is primarily mediated
by certain classes of RNA binding domains and motifs (Morozova
et al., 2006; Shulman-Peleg et al., 2008). Speciﬁcally, the correlated
pattern of sequence and structure in a RNA binding protein can
be recognized and bound by a speciﬁc RNA sequence, and then
the resulting protein—RNA complex performs important functions
somewhere.

In recognition of RNA functional importance in living molecules
and close association with protein in its activities, experimental
and computational studies of protein—RNA complexes have been
substantially increased (Ellis et (11., 2007; Hall, 2002; Jones et al.,
2001). Recently, a variety of approaches have been proposed to
study protein—RNA interactions (Lunde et al., 2007). Though some
improvement has been obtained, the precise mechanisms of the
protein—RNA interaction are far from being fully understood. In
particular, there is no efﬁcient way to experimentally identify
protein—RNA binding sites that play a central role in forming
protein—RNA interactions (Chen and Lim, 2008; Terribilini
et al., 2006). Hence, it is strongly demanded to develop a
reliable computational method to accurately predict protein—RNA
interacting sites by exploring the accumulated data of protein—RNA
complexes.

Many studies indicate that there is a strong relationship
between interaction residues and their compositions in protein—
RNA complexes (Doherty et (11., 2001; Ellis et al., 2007; Kim
et al., 2006). A number of machine learning techniques have been
applied to detect RNA binding residues in protein sequences. For
instance, BindN (Wang and Brown, 2006) uses an SVM-based
classiﬁer to predict potential RNA or DNA binding residues in
proteins by sequence features. RNAProB (Cheng et al., 2008)

Prediction of protein-RNA binding sites

 

and PPRint (Kumar et (11., 2008) implement promising SVM-based
methods based on evolutionary proﬁles in the identiﬁcation.
RNABindR (Terribilini et (11., 2007) generates a naive Bayes
classiﬁer to predict RNA binding amino acid residues in proteins.
Jeong et (11. (2004) proposed a neural network method for predicting
RNA binding sites by using amino acid and secondary structure
elements. Spriggs et (11. (2009) improved the prediction performance
using four sequence properties by a SVM-based classiﬁer (see
Supplementary Table S3 for the summary). However, most of the
methods have not considered the interaction features underlying
the partnership between protein residue and RNA nucleotide in
the identiﬁcation process. Actually, various interaction features
extracted from the interacting sites give us valuable information
to understand how a protein interacts with a RNA. If integrated
together, these features can describe the interacting patterns in a
more comprehensive way. On the other hand, for many existing
methods such as RNABindR (Terribilini et (11., 2007), although the
interface propensity of residue with RNA is designed to describe
interactions, it is simply deﬁned as the proportion of a given
amino acid in interaction sites divided by the proportion of the
residue in the dataset. In this article, by noting that amino acids
with different neighbor amino acids or in different local structures
often exhibit preferences for their RNA partners (Kim et (11.,
2003, 2006; Terribilini et (11., 2006), we design a new feature,
i.e. interaction propensity of an amino acid, which considers the
neighbors of the amino acid simultaneously instead of examining
itself alone, based on the message transforming between a protein
residue with its neighbors and the interacting nucleotides of RNA
molecule. Moreover, we consider sequence and structure features
of a residue which are also the contributors of the RNA binding
events (Morozova et (11., 2006). Clearly, all of those information are
indispensable descriptors of the interaction patterns between protein
residues and RNA nucleotide from different aspects, and thereby
are expected to have strongly representative power as a combined
feature when integrated together.

In the present work, we propose a novel random forest (RF)
method for predicting RNA binding sites in proteins from both
sequence and structure features. The RF (Breiman, 2001) is an
ensemble classiﬁer with many decision trees, which has many
advantages, e.g. producing a highly accurate classiﬁer, handling a
very large number of input variables and estimating the importance
of variables in determining classiﬁcation (Breiman, 2001). We
compute the mutual interaction propensity between amino acids
and nucleotides by using representative protein—RNA complexes in
PDB (Berman et (11 ., 2000). In addition to the interaction propensity
feature, several important residue properties have been combined
as hybrid features. The cross-validation test has conﬁrmed the
effectiveness of our method. The comparison study shows that the
accuracy (ACC) of our method is better than previous methods
such as RNABindR, BindN and PPRint, and achieves an ACC
of 84.5%, F-measure of 0.85 and area under curve (AUC) of
0.92 prediction of the RNA binding residues for a test dataset.
Computational experimental results also show that the proposed
interaction propensity is a very powerful feature for predicting RNA
binding sites in proteins. Moreover, we identiﬁed the importance
of individual features and their combinations in contributing both
the speciﬁcity (SF) of protein—RNA binding and the ACC of the
prediction, which provides biological insights into the roles of
sequences and structures in protein—RNA interactions.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Datasets

The protein—RNA complexes used in our experiments were
downloaded from RsiteDB (Shulman-Peleg et (11., 2008) which were
retrieved from the Nucleic Acid Database (Berman et (11., 1992).
In total, there are 339 complexes with resolution better than 3A
and 1182 protein—RNA chains of these complexes. After removing
protein and RNA chains with sequence identity above 25% and
60%, respectively (Altschul et (11., 1997), we got 205 non-redundant
protein—RNA chains in 164 complexes. We used ENTANGLE
(Allers and Shamoo, 2001) to deﬁne the interaction sites between
protein chain and RNA. Protein—RNA interactions that include
hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, hydrophobic and van der Waals
interactions (Allers and Shamoo, 2001) have been considered.
Residues in protein—RNA interface were extracted as the interacting
residues. We identiﬁed the interacting pairs between amino acids in
protein chains and their partner nucleotides. Totally, 5261 (9.87%)
amino acid residues were deﬁned as the RNA binding sites from
the total 53 315 residues, the rest 48 054 (90.13%) amino acids were
deﬁned as non-binding protein residues. The RNA binding chains
are listed in the Supplementary Materials.

2.2 Interaction propensity

We identify and quantify the mutual dependence between the protein
residues and RNA nucleotide by calculating a new measure, i.e.
interaction propensity. We highlight the important role of the nearest
neighbor residues in determining the SF of biochemical features
and the preference of interacting with nucleotides for an amino
acid residue (Terribilini et (11., 2006; Wang et (11., 2007). Hence,
we deﬁne the mutual interaction propensity of a residue triplet and
a nucleotide. A triplet is regarded as interacting with a nucleotide
when its central residue interacts with the nucleotide. The mutual
interaction propensity is deﬁned as follows:

_ 
S(x.y) — “erpsﬁx’yﬂo‘gzﬁxﬁfﬁyy

where x represents a residue triplet, y represents a nucleotide (i.e. y e
{A,G,C,U}). f[,,r(x,y)=Np,r(x,y)/ZX’prsr(x,y) represents the
frequency of x interacting y in the protein—RNA pair (1), r),
where Np, r(x, y) is the number of residue triplet x binding to
nucleotide y and Zxﬁpr, r(x, y) is the total number of residue
triplet and nucleotide pairs in the protein—RNA pair (p,r). fp(x)=
Np(x)/ZXNp(x) represents the frequency of the residue triplet x
in protein 1), where Np(x) is the number of residue triplet x and
ZXNPOC) is the total number of all residue triplets in the protein
1). Similarly, fr(y)=Nr(y)/Zer(y) represents the frequency of a
nucleotide y, where N r (y) is the number of nucleotide y and 2y N r (y)
is the total number of nucleotides in the RNA r. The interaction
propensity of a triplet x and a nucleotide y is calculated on all
interacting protein—RNA pairs in the dataset.

2.3 Descriptors for amino acid residues

Given the dataset, we identify the binding SP between all the existing
triplets and four RNA nucleotides. A protein sequence of length 1
residues corresponds to 1—2 triplets and every triplet will get its
corresponding values of interaction propensity with four types of

nucleotides individually. Thus, each residue of 1 —2 centers in the
triplets is described by a 4D vector.

In addition to the identiﬁed mutual interaction propensity between
amino acid triplets and nucleotides, we also encode other properties
of amino acids to describe their RNA binding SP. Each amino
acid residue in the residue neighbor proﬁle is characterized by six
descriptors including physicochemical characteristics, hydrophobic
index, relative accessible surface area, secondary structure, sequence
conservation score and side-chain environment. The following list
is the details of these descriptors for amino acid residues.

0 Physicochemical characteristics: the physicochemical features
of an amino acid residue are described by three values:
number of atoms, number of electrostatic charge and number
of potential hydrogen bonds (Li et (11., 2008). These values are
only related to the type of amino acid and do not contain any
structural information of the amino acid residue.

0 Hydrophobicity: the hydrophobicity of an amino acid residue
is described by the hydrophobic index designed in Sweet and
Eisenberg (1983).

0 Relative accessible surface area: the accessible surface area of
an amino acid is calculated by DSSP program (Kabsch and
Sander, 1983). Then we calculate the property by dividing the
accessible surface area with the accessible surface area of fully
exposed amino acid. The accessible surface areas of the fully
exposed amino acids are based on Rost and Sander (1994).

0 Secondary structure: the secondary structure of an amino acid
residue is also calculated by DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983).
It is divided into three states: helix, sheet and coil. DSSP
secondary structure types I, G and H are considered as helix;
types E and B are considered as sheet; types T, S and blank are
considered as coil. We use (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 1) to
represent the candidate residue that belongs to three types of
secondary structures, respectively.

0 Conservation score: the values of sequence conservation for
amino acid residues are obtained by PSI-BLAST (Altschul
et (11., 1997) search of the protein chain sequence in the Uniprot
database (UniProt Consortium, 2008). The round of iteration
is set to 3. The result of the PSI-BLAST search is a position-
speciﬁc scoring matrix (PSSM). We extract the diagonal value
of each residue as the value of its sequence conservation.

0 Side-chain environment: pKa value of an amino acid side
chain is an important factor in determining environmental
characteristics of a protein. The side-chain pKa values are
obtained from Nelson and Cox (2004) representing protein
side-chain environmental properties and are widely used (Wang
and Brown, 2006).

2.4 Encoding scheme

In this study, we employ the sliding window technique to encode
the amino acid residues of proteins. We use the windows of odd
number of residues with size s in the encoding scheme. Whether a
residue belongs to the RNA binding class or not is determined by
the middle residue (itself) and its neighbor s — 1 residue proﬁle. The
feature vector representing the residue in the window is encoded by
joining the properties of the s residues. As aresult a single candidate,
residue is represented in a feature vector of s X 7 descriptors with

s X 15 feature elements. We tested various window sizes and choose
the best one, i.e. s = 5 (Table 1). When we evaluate the importance of
these features by choosing a proper combination of descriptors, the
number of elements in the feature vector is changed correspondingly.

2.5 RF for training and prediction

We formulate the RNA binding residue as a binary classiﬁcation
problem, where a residue is labeled with 1 if it is a RNA binding site
or 0 otherwise. RF is a classiﬁcation algorithm combining ensemble
tree-structured classiﬁers (Breiman, 2001), which is often used when
we have a very large training dataset and a very large number of
input features. A typical RF model is made up hundreds of decision
trees, and the major votes will determine the ﬁnal prediction. The RF
algorithm is implemented by the R randomForest package (Liaw and
Wiener, 2002), where we use the default parameters of the package
in this article.

The prediction is evaluated by the 5-fold cross-validation. The
whole dataset was randomly partitioned into ﬁve groups with
approximately equal size. To ensure that the training process is
completely independent of the test data, the classiﬁer is trained
on the four groups and tested on the remaining group and each
of them is chosen for assessment one by one. The predictive
results are evaluated by different measures, i.e. sensitivity (SN),
SP, ACC, F -measure and Matthews correlation coefﬁcient (MCC).
Mathematically, they are deﬁned by the following equations:

_ TP
SN — T—P+FN—’
_ TN
SP — TN—+_FP’
_ TP+TN
ACC — TP+FP+TN+FN 7

_ 2><SN><SP
F-measure_ —SN+SP ,

MCC: TPXTN—FPXFN _

\/(TP+FN)(TP+FP)(TN+FP)(TN+FN)
where TP, FN, FF, and TN are the numbers of true positive, false
negative, false positive and true negative residues in the prediction,
respectively. SN and SP are also used to plot the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves and AUC is also calculated. F -measure
is the harmonic mean of SN and SP. Usually the best F -measure
point is chosen as the cutoff for SN and SF in ROC curves. MCC
value ranges between 1 (all predictions are correct) and —1 (none
are correct).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

3.1 Prediction performance of RF method

The overall performance of our prediction method was evaluated
by 5-fold cross-validation experiments as described in Section 2. To
identify the SP and SN, we use the ROC curve as shown in Figure 1
to present their interrelationship. With an input window of 5 amino
acids, our RF-based classiﬁer achieves an ACC of 84.5%, F -measure
of 0.85 and AUC of 0.92. The maximum F -measure point is also
shown in Figure 1, which refers to the cutoff point for the best SP and
SN of the prediction performance. The detailed measures are listed
in Table 1. Table 1 also summarizes the predictive performance
using various input window sizes from 1 to 13, i.e. the sliding
window length in the coding scheme. The maximum F -measure
point is also chosen as the cutoff of SP and SN in every window size.

The performance of F -measure and AUC is slightly declined when
we increase the window size. The best performance was obtained
with the window size of 5 residues. The test provided evidences
for the effectiveness of our method to predict the RNA interface
residues in proteins. Figures 2a and b show an example of the
predicted interface residues with RNA in protein 1R3E:A. Figure 2a
presents the actual interface residues of the protein structure in red.
Figure 2b uses a different coloring scheme to illustrate the prediction
performance on individual residues. Figure 2c gives a part of the
predicted versus the actual binding residues (structure is shown in the
box panel). Most of the actual interface residues (ACC of 85.57%)
are well identiﬁed in the protein, and the prediction details are shown
in Supplementary Materials.

3.2 Comparison with other methods

In this work, we proposed a novel RF-based method to predict
the binding residues in proteins by using the combined features.
By considering the two-side information in the interacting partners
of amino acids and nucleotides, we show that the proposed
interaction propensity feature is able to represent the binding SF
of the residues in proteins. The sequence features as well as the
structure features of the residues can discriminate the propensity
of amino acids to interact with RNA when combined together.
The superior performance of the prediction in cross-validation

experiments conﬁrms the effectiveness of our method. In this
subsection, we ﬁirther validate our method by comparing our method
with other existing methods.

In recent years, several methods have been proposed to predict
RNA binding residues in proteins, such as RNABindR (Terribilini
et (11., 2007), BindN (Wang and Brown, 2006), RNAProB (Cheng
et (11., 2008) and PPRint (Kumar et (11., 2008). For comparison,
we tested the prediction performances of these methods. In the
205 protein chains, we constructed a training dataset by randomly
selecting 105 protein chains as well as a testing dataset of the
rest 100 chains. We trained the RF classiﬁer by using the training
dataset and validated the prediction in the testing dataset to compare
the performance of the methods. The tradeoff threshold between
SN and SF of our method was set to be RF voting score that
gave the best performance. Figure 3 shows the ROC curve of
the results. The predictions in the testing 100 protein chains by
other methods were carried out by using their default parameters.
The results are shown in Table 2. RNABindR is a Bayesian
classiﬁer for RNA binding sites in proteins. BindN, RNAProB and
PPRint are predictors of protein—RNA binding residues based on
SVMs. RNABindR was implemented in three different options, i.e.
‘optimal prediction (opt)’, ‘high sensitivity (sn)’ and ‘high speciﬁcity
(sp)’ prediction. Similarly, BindN was tested with two options
of ‘expected sensitivity of 80% (sn)’ and ‘expected speciﬁcity of
80% (sp)’. RNABindR and BindN with high SP are obtained at the
expense of SN, and vice versa. Clearly, our method consistently
outperforms the existing methods in terms of these measures.

Since some prediction scores of the compared methods are not
available, their ROC curves cannot be drawn. To remove the possible
biases in the comparison, we also compared the underlying machine
learning algorithms in these predictors. We implemented several
different algorithms, i.e. support vector machine (SVM), naive
Bayes (NB) and neural network (NN), using the same procedure
as our RF—based method. Figure 3 shows the ROC curves of
different classiﬁers in the testing dataset. The performance details
are given in Table 2. In Figure 3, AUC of RF—, SVM-, NN- and NB-
based predictors are 0.912, 0.801, 0.782 and 0.713, respectively.
Our RF-based method clearly outperformed other classiﬁers. As
to the different datasets, we also tested our methods in several
benchmarks. In RNA binding protein datasets RB86 (Kumar et (11.,
2008; Terribilini et (11., 2006), RB107 (Kumar et (11., 2008; Wang
and Brown, 2006), RB109 (Terribilini et (11., 2007) and RB149
(Terribilini et (11., 2007), our method can achieve the AUC of 0.884,
0.885, 0.884 and 0.858, respectively, which also demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. We also carried out more
comparison with RNAProB (Cheng et (11., 2008). The details of
these results can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

3.3 Evaluation of feature importance

We combined various features of the residues in addition to the
mutual interaction propensity to represent the speciﬁc interaction
properties of protein residues with RNA nucleotides. Seven
descriptors were contained in a hybrid feature vector. To verify
their effects on the prediction of binding sites, we tested the
performance of the selected features of these descriptors. Table 3
presents the results of prediction performance of the 5-fold cross-
validation by subtracting one of the descriptors individually in the
scoring scheme. After subtracting each descriptor in describing these

residues, we found that the ACC of prediction was declined than that
of using all descriptors. For instance, when we deleted the interaction
propensity, ACC, F -measure and AUC of the prediction became
75.8%, 0.751 and 0.828 comparing to 84.5%, 0.859 and 0.923 with

encoded in the feature vector, respectively. The mutual interaction
propensity of the residues and its nucleotide partners can provide
more conﬁdence of the binding events, and actually has increased
the prediction performance signiﬁcantly (~10%). Figure 2d presents
the mutual interaction propensity value between the triplets and
nucleotides for protein 1R3E:A. The selected red box corresponds
to the binding sites shown in Figure 2c. For comparison, Figure 2e
gives the interface propensity information of different amino acid
types (upper panel) and the corresponding interface propensity value
of the residues in protein 1R3E:A. Similarly, the box corresponds
to the zoomed sites shown in Figure 2c. The interface propensity
(Terribilini et (11., 2006) of each amino acid type shown in the
upper panel was deﬁned as the ratio of the percentage of one type
residue in the interfaces in the percentage of the type residue in
our entire dataset. From Figure 2d and e, we found that more
speciﬁc information on the interacting sites in the protein were
extracted by interaction propensity between residues of protein
and RNA. When we use the interface propensity instead of the
mutual interaction propensity in the prediction, our method only
achieved the ACC of 73.5%, F-measure of 0.748 and AUC of
0.827. If we only use the interface propensity as the descriptor
in the encoding scheme, we got the prediction of ACC of 65.3%,
F -measure of 0.650 and AUC of 0.710 (compare to ACC of 80.8,
F -measure of 0.831 and AUC of 0.906 when only using interaction
propensity in feature vector). Clearly, the prediction performance
was highly improved when we developed the mutual interaction
propensity as the descriptor of the RNA binding information. We
also tested the prediction performances by alternative deﬁnition of
mutual interaction propensity. The details of these results are shown
in the Supplementary Materials.

We also tested the prediction performance of our model
with different combinations of features, which can be found in
Supplementary Materials. Some of the descriptors, i.e. ‘Accessible
surface’ and ‘Secondary structure’, can be calculated only after
the protein structure information is available. If we category them
into structure descriptors and the others are sequence descriptors,
Table 3 also gives the results of the prediction which combines
sequence features and that of structure information. When we use
the scheme of combining mutual interaction propensity with other

features based only on sequence (without ‘Structure features’), our
RF-based method can achieve a predictive ACC of 81.4%, F -
measure of 0.832 and AUC value of 0.905. In contrast, the method
without ‘Sequence features’ achieves an ACC of 82.6%, F -measure
of 0.847 and AUC of 0.9 17. The results indicate that the combination
of all these descriptors, i.e. interaction propensity, sequence features
and structure features has more representative power so that
more information can be extracted by the predictor for better
differentiating protein—RNA binding residues from non-binding
ones.

3.4 Patterns of RNA binding sites

We predicted the RNA binding residues in proteins from integrated
features underlying the residues. The results have already shown
the importance of residue properties in the identiﬁcation of binding
SF. The test also indicated that the combination of the descriptors
can achieve better prediction performance. All these evidences
demonstrate that the combined features capture the speciﬁcities of
RNA binding sites, i.e. they indicate the signatures of the potential
places where the binding events take place. As to the individual
features of these binding sites, we can compare them with that of
non-binding sites to detect their SP. Figure 4 shows the statistics
of encoded mutual interaction propensity of different residues to the
four RNA nucleotides in their feature vectors individually. ‘Binding’
represents the actual interface residues with RNA. ‘Non-binding’
is those residues that are not the interacting residues. When we
randomly sample the same size residues as interface residues, the
mutual interaction propensity statistics is shown in ‘Random’ panel.
‘All’ shows the values of all residue in the dataset. We found that
the values of mutual interaction propensity between actual binding
residues and four type of nucleotides are higher than that of the
non-binding ones, same-size random sampling residues and all the
residues in the dataset, respectively. Also it is interesting to point
out that we can see from Figure 4 that the residues interacting U
are harder to predict than A, C and G based on mutual interaction
propensity.

When we mine the common features of these binding residues,
we can identify the particular features of these residues with their
prioritization contacting with RNA. These features can be used to
construct the markers for discriminating RNA binding sites from
non-binding ones. Structure motifs of binding RNA in the proteins
would be important in the drug design (Liu et (11., 2008). Here,
we learned these features and predicted the RNA binding residues
in proteins by RF classiﬁers. The results demonstrate that our
method can identify the potential binding motifs in proteins. These
features can also be used to identify the functional structure motifs,
such as the ﬁinctional motif (Terribilini et (11., 2006) shown in
Figure 2c. In the future, we will analyze these detailed features
by relating them with the speciﬁc local structures in proteins. These
identiﬁed candidate RNA binding motifs also provide ﬁindamental
structure patterns for binding RNA. Our method can be ﬁirther
extended to these interesting and intriguing research topics in the
future.

4 CONCLUSON

Knowledge regarding how proteins interact with each other and
with other molecules is essential in the understanding of cellular
processes (Weigt et (11., 2009). Here, we proposed a novel method
to predict RNA binding residues in proteins using a RF-based
method by the integrated features. We encoded the residue features
into a vector so as to represent the SF of binding features of
residues in proteins. Our method is mainly based on the mutual
interaction propensity deﬁned between the interacting residues of
protein and RNA. In addition, we also combined various sequence-
and structure-derived features together to represent the interaction
propensity of the amino acid and its partner nucleotides. The learning
and validation processes in the protein—RNA complexes conﬁrm the
effectiveness of our method. The comparison with existing methods
and other classiﬁers further show the advantages of the proposed
method. The importance and contribution of these features were also
evaluated. The identiﬁed binding features underlying the protein will
have implications of protein—RNA binding. In the same manner, our
method can be extended to identify the structure motifs in the RNA
binding proteins as well as the RNA binding SF in protein structures
in future.

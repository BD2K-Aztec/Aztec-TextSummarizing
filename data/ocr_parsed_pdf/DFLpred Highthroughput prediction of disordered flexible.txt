Abstract

Motivation: Disordered flexible linkers (DFLs) are disordered regions that serve as flexible linkers/
spacers in multi—domain proteins or between structured constituents in domains. They are different
from flexible linkers/residues because they are disordered and longer. Availability of experimen—
tally annotated DFLs provides an opportunity to build high—throughput computational predictors of
these regions from protein sequences. To date, there are no computational methods that directly
predict DFLs and they can be found only indirectly by filtering predicted flexible residues with pre—
dictions of disorder.

Results: We conceptualized, developed and empirically assessed a first—of—its—kind sequence—based
predictor of DFLs, DFLpred. This method outputs propensity to form DFLs for each residue in the in—
put sequence. DFLpred uses a small set of empirically selected features that quantify propensities
to form certain secondary structures, disordered regions and structured regions, which are pro—
cessed by a fast linear model. Our high—throughput predictor can be used on the whole—proteome
scale; it needs <1 h to predict entire proteome on a single CPU. When assessed on an independent
test dataset with low sequence—identity proteins, it secures area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve equal 0.715 and outperforms existing alternatives that include methods for the
prediction of flexible linkers, flexible residues, intrinsically disordered residues and various com—
binations of these methods. Prediction on the complete human proteome reveals that about 10%
of proteins have a large content of over 30% DFL residues. We also estimate that about 6000 DFL
regions are long with 230 consecutive residues.

1 Introduction

 

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) lack stable tertiary structure
under physiological conditions, either along their entire sequence or
in localized regions. IDPs are abundant in eukaryotes (Peng et (11.,
2015; Ward et (11., 2004) and are typically involved in signaling,
regulation, control, storage of small molecules, sites for post—
translational modifications (PTMs), transcription, translation and
assembly of multi—protein complexes (Dunker et (11., 2008; Dyson
and Wright, 2005; Peng et (11., 2014; Tompa, 2005; Wright and
Dyson, 1999; Xie et (11., 2007). Their functions complement func—
tions of structured proteins, which include small molecule binding,
transport and catalysis (Radivojac et (11., 2007). The newest release

of DisProt database (Sickmeier et (11., 2007), the main source of
functionally annotated IDPs, lists >30 functions (Dunker et (11.,
2002) that have been assigned to about 1200 disordered regions.
About 74% 0f the functionally characterized disordered regions in
DisProt concern binding to a variety of partners: proteins, DNAs,
RNAs, metals and lipids. The most populated non—binding functions
include ﬂexible linkers (9%), sites for several types of PTMs (7%),
transactivation (4%), nuclear localization signals (1%) and electron
transfer (1%). Several methods have been developed for the predic—
tion of binding disordered regions from protein sequences. They in—
clude methods that address protein binding (Disfani et (11., 2012;

Khan et (11., 2013; Malhis and Gsponer, 2015; Meszaros et (11.,
2009; Peng and Kurgan, 2015; Yan et (11., 2015) and RNA and
DNA binding (Peng and Kurgan, 2015). However, methods for the
prediction of the other functions of the intrinsically disordered re—
gions are lacking.

The disordered flexible linkers (DFLs) are disordered regions
that serve as linkers or spacers between domains in multi—domain
proteins and between structured constituents in domains (Dunker
et (11., 2002). Experimental annotation of DFLs primarily relies on
the X—ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and circular dichro—
ism. We consider these regions for several reasons. First, this is the
most annotated and not related to binding function of disordered re—
gions. Second, DFLs are important for a variety of cellular processes.
A few recent examples include formation of amyloid fibrils
(Shvadchak and Subramaniam, 2014), linking multiple disordered
protein binding regions (Oldfield and Dunker, 2014), and move—
ment of structured domains between catalytic sites (Anand and
Mohanty, 2012). Third, there is no computational methods that pre—
dict this class of disordered regions. DFLs are cousins of linkers,
which are regions that connect domains and maintain inter—domain
interactions (Chen et (11., 2013; George and Heringa, 2002). A sub—
class of linkers are ﬂexible linkers, defined as ﬂexible inter—domain
regions that allow two domains to move relatively to each other
(Chen et (11., 2013). DFLs differ from linker regions in two aspects:
(1) DFLs are characterized by extreme level of ﬂexibility and lack of
defined structure (they form conformational ensembles) as com—
pared with linkers and ﬂexible linkers that have more defined struc—
tures; and (2) linkers are shorter (avg length of 10 residues) and
localized between domains (George and Heringa, 2002), while
DFLs tend to be longer (avg length of 25 residues in our dataset) and
could be localized in domains, for instance to link structured elem—
ents in a domain; we show empirically that they are frequently local—
ized in domains and give examples of intra— and inter—domain DFLs.

Although there are no computational methods that directly pre—
dict DFLs in protein sequences, waary—Merski algorithm (UMA)
(waary et (11., 2002) can be used to predict ﬂexible linker regions.
It assumes that ﬂexible linkers are less likely to be conserved in the
sequence and secondary structure and to be depleted in hydrophilic
residues. Thus, UMA quantifies every residue as a weighted sum of
hydrophobicity score and conservation scores for sequence and sec—
ondary structure. The two conservation scores are derived using
ClustalX (Thompson et (11., 1997) and PHDsec (Rost and Sander,
1993; Rost and Sander, 1994), and the hydrophobicity score is as—
signed using the Kyte and Doolittle’s hydropathy index (Kyte and
Doolittle, 1982). A low UMA score indicates that a residue is more
likely to be a flexible linker. Because ﬂexible linkers are a subset of
ﬂexible residues, they could be also potentially identified with
sequence—based predictors of ﬂexible residues. These predictors in—
clude PROFbval (Schlessinger and Rost, 2005; Schlessinger et (11.,
2006), FlexPred (Kuznetsov and McDuffie, 2008; Kuznetsov, 2008),
PredBF (Pan and Shen, 2009), PredyFlexy (de Brevern et (11., 2012)
and DynaMine (Cilia et (11., 2013, 2014). PROFbval predicts B—fac—
tors using a neural network model, where a low/high real B—factor
value indicates a low/high propensity of a residue being ﬂexible.
PredBF also predicts B—factors but using a two—layer support vector
regression model. FlexPred predicts conformationally variable pos—
itions in the input protein chain using a support vector machine
model. PredyFlexy classifies every input residue as rigid, intermedi—
ate or ﬂexible and also outputs putative normalized B—factors and
root mean square fluctuations, from molecular dynamic simulations.
DynaMine quantifies backbone ﬂexibility in terms of N—H S2 order

parameter values using regression where smaller S2 means that a
given residue is more likely to be ﬂexible.

The UMA method and protein flexibility predictors predict ﬂex—
ible linkers/residues, but they do not accommodate for the dis—
ordered state of these residues. Moreover, UMA requires that the
input sequence has homologous sequences to generate multiple se—
quence alignment profiles, which means that it may not generate
predictions for some proteins, and is tedious to execute because its
implementation requires manual processing. To this end, we have
developed DFLpred, the first method that predicts DFLs. DFLpred
does not need alignment profiles, is fast to execute and is provided
to the end users as a fully automated webserver at http://biomine.
ece.ualberta.ca/DFLpred/.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Datasets

The functionally annotated data were collected from the newest re—
lease 6.0.2 of DisProt that includes 694 sequences. We excluded
DP00688 sequence that was too long (>18 000 residues) to predict
with the PSIPRED (Buchan et (11., 2013) to generate secondary struc—
ture. We selected 204 sequences, which include 82 proteins that
have annotations of DFLs and 122 proteins that do not have DFL
annotations but for which all residues are annotated. This way we
included all annotated DFLs and reduced the number of ambiguous
(unannotated) residues.

We assumed that residues that are not annotated as DFLs but
have other functional annotations are non—disordered ﬂexible linker
(NDFL) residues. The residues without functional annotations were
excluded from the design and assessment. We divided the set of 204
proteins into five subsets and reduced sequence similarity between
these subsets with BLASTClust (Altschul et (11., 1990). First, we clus—
tered the 204 sequences with sequence identity threshold at 25%
and coverage of at least 10% of the sequence length. Second, the re—
sulting 160 clusters that include similar sequences (>25 % similarity)
were divided at random between the five sub sets to ensure that each
subset has similar number of sequences and similar ratio of DFL to
NDFL residues. Four of these subsets were used in 4—fold cross—
validation protocol to empirically design our predictor, i.e. to con—
ceptualize and select inputs for the predictive model, and to select
and parameterize this model. These data constitute the training
dataset. The remaining fifth subset was used as an independent
(never used in the design) test dataset. This way, sequences in the
test dataset share low similarity with sequences in the training data—
set, and also sequence in individual folds of the training dataset
share low similarity with sequences in the other folds. The training
and test datasets have 144 sequences and 60 sequences, respectively,
and they are available at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/DFLpred/.

2.2 DFLs and protein domains

We used Interpro (Mitchell et (11., 2015) to annotate domains to em—
pirically investigate whether DFLs are localized within or between
domains. Interpro is a template—based method that integrates 11
databases including Pfam (Finn et (11., 2014), PRINTS (Attwood
et (11., 2012), PROSITE (Sigrist et (11., 2013) and ProDom (Servant
et (11., 2002) to provide prediction of proteins families and domains.
The comprehensive coverage of the source databases, 15 years of
history and high rate of updates make Interpro a mainstream tool
for the annotation of domains (Goujon et (11., 2010). The ratio of
the number of intra—domain to inter—domain DFL residues in the
training dataset is 905/1098 : 0.82. This indicates that a large

fraction of DFLs are localized in domains. The ratio of intra—domain
DFL to NDFL residues is 905/7019 : 0.13 and for inter—domain is
1098/14 132 : 0.08. To sum up, our results suggest that DFLs are

often localized in protein domains.

2.3 Evaluation procedures

The prediction of DFLs results in a numeric score in the range be—
tween 0 and 1 representing propensity of each residue in the input
sequence being in a DFL. We used the receiver operating characteris—
tic (ROC) curve and the area under ROC (AUC) to examine the pre—
dictive quality. To plot ROC curves and quantify AUC values, we
calculated the true—positive rates (TPRs) and false—positive rates
(FPRs) by comparing predictions with native annotations at differ—
ent cutoffs imposed on the predicted scores. If a score is more than
or equal to a given threshold, then the corresponding residue is
assumed to be in DFL, otherwise it is assumed as NDFL. TPR and
FPR are defined as:

TPR : TP/(TP + FN) : TP/number_of_DFL_residues (1)

FPR : FP/(FP + TN) : FP/number_of_NDFL_residues (2)

where TP is the number of true positives (correctly predicted DFL
residues), FN is the number of false negatives (DFL residues that
were predicted as NDFL residues), FF is the number of false posi—
tives (NDFL residues that were predicted as DFL residues), TN is
the number of true negatives (correctly predicted NDFL residues).
Given TPR and FPR values at different thresholds ranging between
0 and 1, we plotted the ROC curve and calculated the corresponding
AUC value.

We also calculated AUCIprpR, which is the AUC for low range
of FPR values, between 0 and 0.1. This part at the beginning of the
ROC curve reﬂects ability to predict a small number of high—quality
DFL residues, i.e. only a relatively small portion of these predictions
are FPs. We also compute Ratio : AUCIOwFpR/AUcrandOm where
AUCIprpR is divided by the AUC of a random predictor (for which
TPR always equals to FPR) computed for FPR values between 0 and
0.1. This Ratio reﬂects how much better a given predictor is when
compared with a random prediction.

Following (Disfani et (11., 2012; Peng and Kurgan, 2015; Yan
et (11., 2015), we tested statistical significance of differences in pre—
dictive quality offered by DFLpred and other methods, and between
the selected design of DFLpred and other considered designs. This
test investigates whether results on a given dataset are not biased by
a subset of proteins by measuring whether the predictive perform—
ance is consistent over different subsets of the dataset. First, we ran—
domly selected half of proteins from a given test dataset (test dataset
or test folds from the cross validation on the training dataset) 10
times and we measured predictive performance of all considered
methods on these 10 protein sets. We compared these 10 pairs of re—
sults between DFLpred and other methods. Given that measure—
ments are normal, as assessed with the Anderson—Darling test
(Anderson and Darling, 1952), we used paired t—test, otherwise we
used the Wilcoxon signed—rank test (Wilcoxon, 1945). We con—
sidered a given difference to be significant if the p—value < 0.01.

2. Convert this representation into empirically selected set of nu—
meric features that are computed using sliding windows.

3. Input the selected features into an empirically selected and para—
meterized predictive model to generate propensity scores.

2.4. 1 Sequence representation

In the first layer, we represented every residue by its AA type, its
physicochemical properties estimated based on the AA indices from
the AAindex database (Kawashima et (11., 2008), secondary structure
predicted with PSIPRED (Buchan et (11., 2013), intrinsically dis—
ordered and structured regions predicted with IUPred (Dosztanyi
et (11., 2005) and sequence complexity computed with SEG
(Wootton, 1994). Supplementary Figure S1 summarizes enrichment
and depletion of the 20 AA types in DFL regions. We note a clear
pattern where DFLs are significantly enriched in the disorder—pro—
moting residues, such as Q, S, E and P, and depleted in the order—
promoting residues, including F, Y, I, M, L and V; details are
discussed in Supplementary Section 1.

2.4.2 Considered features

In the second layer, we generated numerical features that quantify
the considered structural and sequence—based properties for each
residue of the input AA sequence. We represented every residue by a
feature vector calculated from a sliding window centered on that
residue. The sliding window aggregates structural and sequence—
based information by considering characteristics of AAs adjacent in
the sequence. The concept of the sliding window has been adopted
in other relevant predictors such as MoRFpred, fMoRFpred,
DisoRDPbind, PROFbval, FlexPred, PredBF, PredyFlexy and
DynaMine. We set the length of the sliding window to 17, which is
the median value of the length of longest per protein DFLs in our
dataset. This way the selected window size covers the full length of
at least half of DFLs without recruiting much of potential noise
(NDFL residues) when used to predict shorter regions. We did not
pad the window for the residues located at either terminus of the se—
quence, and correspondingly the length of the sliding window is
reduced on one of its sides, i.e. window size is 8 for the first and last
residues in the sequence. Consequently, we normalize values of fea—
tures computed over the residues in the window by the size of the
window. In total, we considered 2236 features including 40 features
derived directly from the sequence, 2124 features derived from phys—
icochemical properties of AAs quantified based on the AAindex
database, 22 features generated from the putative secondary struc—
ture, 40 features from putative intrinsic disorder and structured re—
gions and 10 features from the sequence complexity. These features
quantify composition of AAs; composition, counts and length of

putative secondary structures, intrinsically disordered regions, struc—
tured regions and high sequence complexity regions in the sliding
window; average physicochemical properties of residues in the slid—
ing windows; and AAs type, secondary structure, disorder status, se—
quence complexity status and physicochemical properties of the
residue in the center of the window. We decided to use all physico—
chemical properties from AAindex (thus the large number of these
features) and our empirical feature selection to remove irreverent
and redundant features because there are no prior results that we
could use to pre—select a subset of these properties. Detailed list and
description of the considered features are included in Supplementary
Section 2.

2.4.3 Selected features and predictive model

Our vector of 2236 features likely includes features that are irrele—
vant to the prediction of DFLs and features that have high mutual
correlations. We used a two—step empirical feature selection to select
a subset of features characterized by high predictive value and low
mutual correlations.

In the first step we removed low—quality features that have low
correlation with the annotation of the DFLs. We have two types of
features: real—valued (e.g. features computed as an average over the
sliding window) and binary (e.g. disordered versus ordered status of
the residue in the center of the window). Inspired by (Disfani et (11.,
2012; Yan et (11., 2015), we used point—biserial correlation coeffi—
cient (rpb) and (p coefficient (0)), respectively, for these two feature

types:

MDFL - MNDFL

r 7 "DLF >< "NDLF
ph — —
Sn

"2 (3)

i countplAm >< countpoANmL — countplANmL >< countpoAm

 

(4)
countlu1 >< countluo >< count Am >< countANm

In formula (3), MDFL and MNDFL (nDFL and nNDFL) are the
means (numbers) of values a given real—valued feature for the resi—
dues annotated as DFLs and NDFLs, respectively; n : nDFL + nNDFL
and 5,, is the standard deviation of all values of that feature. In for—
mula (4), countFWz is the number of values 1' : {0, 1} of binary fea—
ture F corresponding to residues with values [2 : {NDFL, DFL} of
the annotation A; countp, and countA;z are the number of values 1' :
{0, 1} of binary feature F and the number of residues with values [2 :
{NDFL, DFL} of the annotation A, respectively. We calculated aver—
age rpb (for the real—valued features) and (p (for the binary features)
for all considered features from four correlations computed on the
training folds from the 4—fold cross—validation on the training data—
set. We normalized the values of the average rpb and (p correlations
to the —1 to 1 range using min—max normalization, and removed
the features for which the absolute normalized rpb or (p value is less
than threshold Tstepj. Next, we ranked the remaining features by
their absolute normalized rpb or (p values.

In the second step, inspired by (Disfani et (11., 2012; Yan et (11.,
2015 ), we eliminated mutually correlated features using the Pearson
correlation coefficient (rm). First, a set of selected features is initial—
ized with the top—ranked in the first step feature. Next, we calculated
rm between the next—ranked feature and all selected features. If the
absolute value of this rm is less than threshold Tstepz, then we add
this next—ranked features into the set of selected features, otherwise
we do not add it. We apply this procedure through the entire list of
ranked features passed from the first step.

We vary values of each of the two thresholds, Tsteﬂ and Twp;
between 0.1 and 0.9 with step of 0.05, to obtain 17 X 17 : 289

different feature sets. The corresponding feature sets vary in size be—
tween 1 and 884 features. Each feature set is used with three classi—
fiers: logistic regression, naive Bayes and k—nearest neighbor, in the
4—folds cross—validation on the training dataset to select the design
that offers the highest AUC value. We also parameterized logistic re—
gression and k—nearest neighbor classifiers for each of these experi—
ments by selecting their parameters that correspond to the highest
AUC in the 4—folds cross—validation on the training dataset. Naive
Bayes has no parameters. For the logistic regression, we considered
ridge : 10", where x ranges from —4 to 4 with step of 1. For the
k—nearest neighbor, we consider the number of neighbors k ranging
from 50 to 800 with the step of 50. Supplementary Table S1 sum—
marizes results with the highest AUC value for each of the three clas—
sifiers, which are selected from across the experiments that
correspond to 7514 combinations of the two thresholds and differ—
ent parameters of classifiers (289 combinations for Naive Bayes +
9"298 for logistic regression + 16"289 for k—nearest neighbor).

We selected the logistic regression classifier with four features
that gives the highest values of AUC, AUCIOWPPR and ratio. The dif—
ferences in these three measures of predictive quality between the 10—
gistic regression and the other two classifiers are statistically
significant. The ratio reveals that the selected design is 3.3 times bet—
ter than a random predictor when predicting with low FPR, i.e.
when a high fraction of predictions of DFL residues (predicted posi—
tive residues) is correct. The architecture of this model is shown in
Figure 1. Given an input AA sequence, it uses putative annotations
of structured and long disordered regions generated with IUPred
and two physicochemical properties of residues that quantify pro—
pensity for formation of helices and turns.

3 Results
3.1 Analysis of the DFLpred’s predictive model

DFLpred’s model combines values of four empirically selected fea—
tures using a linear function to generate the output propensities.
These features were computed from the sequence using sliding win—
dows on putative annotations generated with IUPred and two AA
indices; their details are summarized in Table 1. Figure 2 compares
values of the four features between the native DFL and NDFL resi—
dues in the test dataset (these results were not used to design the
model, which is based on the training dataset).

The WIN_IUP_fractionD0 feature quantifies fraction of residues
predicted with IUPred_struct not to be in structured regions in a
window centered on the predicted residue. Its average for DFL resi—
dues is 0.29, for the NDFL residues is 0.60 and for the NFDL resi—
dues annotated as structured is 0.11. The structured residues have
the lowest value because they should be primarily predicted to be in
structured regions; the value > 0 because some of the residues in the
surrounding window could lack structure. The high value of mean
for NFDL residues is driven by the fact that these residues include
disordered residues that are not DFLs which have a large number of
nearby (in the sequence) unstructured residues. The average for
DFLs is in between the other two averages. This reveals that propen—
sity of these residues to be nearby putative structured regions is
lower than for other disordered regions but higher than for struc—
tured regions. This makes sense because residues in DFLs link pri—
marily structured domains, and thus their neighbors in the sequence
should include a sizable fraction of structured residues, but not as
large as for the structured residues.

The plot of the WIN_IUP_stdL feature in Figure 2 suggests
that putative propensities for disorder of residues in DFLs have

Fig. 2. Comparison of values of features used in the DFLpred model between
the native DFL residues (black lines) and native NDFL residues (gray lines) in
the test dataset. The features are ranked by their absolute rpb values from the
highest on the left to the lowest on the right (see Table 1). Values of the
WlN,|UP,stdL are multiplied by 10 to better fit the range of values of the other
features. Dots are the averages and the error bars show the first and third
quantiles

higher standard deviation in the window compared with the
other residues. This means that these propensities fluctuate more
in residues adjacent to DFL residues. This is reasonable given that
DFLs link structured domains where propensity for disorder
should be substantially lower compared with DFLs. In contrast,
residues located in structured or in disordered regions would ex—
perience less variability in the propensities for disorder in these
regions.

The last two features are computed by averaging values of the se—
lected two AA indices in the sliding window. Higher values of the
AURR980118 index (Aurora and Rosee, 1998) indicate higher like—
lihood of a given residue to be included in a helical conformation.
Thus, the corresponding feature can be used as a proxy to quantify
likelihood of helical conformations in the window. Figure 3 shows
that residues in DFLs have lower values of this feature, which sug—
gests that they are less likely to include helices nearby in the se—
quence compared with NDFLs. This again is rational because DFLs
are unstructured. The second, PALJ810114 index (Palau et (11.,
1982), quantifies likelihood of forming turns. Here, DFLs have
higher values compared with the other residues, which is sensible
given that turns are relatively ﬂexible, which is also characteristic
for DFLs.

We also investigated predictive quality of these features
individually and in different sets to find out how much they contrib—
ute to the predictive model and whether they complement each
other. The AUC values based on the 4—fold cross—validations on the
training dataset for the individual features sorted in the order shown
in Table 1 are 0.599, 0.604, 0.584 and 0.580. The fact that AUC

values are similar suggests that these features contribute equally to
our model. When we use the top n : 1, 2, 3, 4 features (ranked as in
Table 1, which is based on the normalized point—biserial correlation
rpb), the corresponding AUC values are 0.599, 0.646, 0.672 and
0.702. This means that each feature adds to the model and demon—
strates that they complement each other.

Overall, we demonstrated that the four features are meaningful
markers of DFLs. They complement each other by using a different
type of information to pinpoint location of DFLs. This agrees with
our empirical approach to design DFLpred in which we explicitly se—
lected highly predictive features (first step of feature selection) that
are characterized by low mutual correlation (second step of feature
selection).

3.2 Comparison of predictive performance with closest
alternative methods

We compared the predictive performance of DFLpred with closest
alternative methods that could be used to find DFLs. These
approaches include the UMA method that finds ﬂexible linkers, pre—
dictors of ﬂexible residues and disordered residues, and a domain
predictor given the fact that classical linkers are localized between
domains. We also combined the results of UMA with the results of
the disorder predictors and the results of the ﬂexibility predictors
with the disorder predictors. This was motivated by the fact that
these combinations could potentially find ﬂexible linkers or ﬂexible
residues localized in disordered regions, which is the hallmark of the
DFLs. We used two ways to combine their predictions, by multiply—
ing the scores predicted with UMA and ﬂexibility predictors by the
binary disorder predictions and by the predicted real—valued propen—
sity for the disorder. In the first case, the UMA and ﬂexibility scores
remain the same for the predicted disordered residues and are set to
zero for the residues that are not predicted to be disordered. In the
second scenario, the UMA and ﬂexibility scores are scaled by the
predicted propensity for disorder. We used a comprehensive set of
predictors of ﬂexible residues including PROFbval, FlexPred,
PredBF, PredyFlexy and Dynamine. We also considered several pre—
dictors of disorder including two versions of IUPred (short and
long), MFDp (Mizianty et (11., 2010) and three versions of Espritz
(NMR, X—Ray and DisProt; Walsh et (11., 2012). We applied
ThreaDom (Xue et (11., 2013) to predict domains, given its strong
predictive performance and availability of a webserver. Details on
the computation of predictions with the other methods are given in
Supplementary Section 3.

Table 2 summarizes results of DFLpred and the other methods
on the test dataset. We show results for DFLpred, UMA, five meth—
ods for prediction of ﬂexible residues, three methods for prediction
of disordered residues (we show results for one version of IUPred
and Espritz that secures the highest AUC) and ThreaDom for the
prediction of domains. We also include result for each of the two
ways to combine these methods, as described above, which secured

the highest AUC value. DFLpred secures the highest AUC,
AUCIOWFPR and Ratio values. The improvement offered by DFLpred
are significant at p—value < 0.01 when compared with all considered
methods. The Ratio indicates that DFLpred is 3.3 times better than
a random predictor in AUC for the low values of FPR g 0.1. The in—
sert in Figure 3 visualizes this difference between this AUC of a ran—
dom predictor (thin diagonal line) and DFLpred (thick black line).

We use two proteins from the test dataset to visualize prediction
of DFLs localized between domains (chemotaxis cheA protein;
Supplementary Fig. S2A) and inside of a domain (troponin I protein;
Supplementary Fig. S2B). CheA includes five domains and we focus
on the C—terminus that includes Hpt, CheY binding and signal trans—
ducing H kinase domains that are connected by two inter—domain
DFLs. Troponin I includes two domains: troponin I N—terminus do—
main, which is disordered, and troponin I domain, which is com—
posed of two sub—domains: IT arm and regulatory head. The IT arm
sub—domain has DFL, which links two of its helices that interact
with troponins T and C that compose the troponin complex. The se—
cond DFL links the two sub—domains. Both of these intra—domain
DFLs enable movement of several structural elements of the tropo—
nin I domain, allowing it to interact with the other members of the
troponin complex (Takeda et (11., 2003). The figures show predic—
tions from DFLpred, UMA, domain predictor ThreaDom and the
best—performing (based on Table 2) disorder predictor Espritz and
ﬂexibility predictor PredyFlexy. DFLpred generates higher propen—
sities in the vicinity of the two inter—domain DFLs in CheA, with the
second one predicted less accurately. It also finds the first intra—
domain DFL and to some extent, given the lower values of propen—
sity, the second intra—domain DFL in troponin I. ThreaDom
accurately finds the inter—domain residues that overlap with the two
DFLs in CheA, but its prediction also includes residues at the
N—terminus that are not DFLs. This method finds the inter—domain
region in troponin I, which is not a DFL, and has difficulty with the
troponin I domain, given it is fragmented into sub—domains compos—
ition. Espritz accurately predicts the disordered residues, which co—
incide with the inter—domain DFLs in CheA, but it also finds
disorder at the N—terminus. It correctly finds the first two disordered
regions in troponin I but it misses the second intra—domain DFL and
predicts the disordered region at the N—terminus the highest propen—
sity while this region is not a linker. UMA finds three ﬂexible linkers
(residues with high scores) in CheA and only the last one coincides
to some extent with the second DFLs. For the second protein, this
method annotates only the N—terminus as a ﬂexible linker and fails
to identify the intra—domain DFLs. Finally, PredyFlexy does not find
inter—domain residues, DFLs or disordered regions, but rather it esti—
mates local ﬂexibility, which ﬂuctuates widely along the sequence of
both proteins. These observations provide context to interpret re—
sults of the other methods in Table 2.

The UMA method secures low AUC and this could be explained
by the fact that UMA predicts ﬂexible linkers that likely exclude link—
ers located in disordered regions; the latter stems from the low value
of AUCIOWFPR and is confirmed by our examples. The low AUC of
UMA is owing to a concave shape of ROC curve that in turn results
from high levels of false positives on the left side of the curve. These
false positives are the residues predicted as DFLs for the purpose of
our evaluation but which in fact correspond to the putative ﬂexible
linkers predicted by UMA with the highest values of propensity. The
predictors of disordered residues have similar weakness. They predict
all disordered residues, irrespective of their function, while most of
them are not DFLs. Their low values of AUCIOWFPR and our troponin
I example suggest that propensities generated for DFLs are lower than
the propensities for other disordered regions. This results in high

FPRs, concave shapes of ROC curves and consequently low AUC val—
ues. Predictors of ﬂexible residues also secure relatively low AUC val—
ues. These methods were built using crystallographic data that
exclude disordered residues and thus they cannot accurately find dis—
ordered residues, which was shown in (Peng and Kurgan, 2012). Our
example reveals that they focus on local, in the sequence, ﬂexibility
that does not correlate with the localization of DFLs. ThreaDom ﬁnds
the inter—domain regions but only some of them are DFLs and it in
general fails to find the intra—domain DFLs. Consequently, its AUC
value is relatively low. Interestingly, combining UMA/ﬂexibility pre—
dictors with the disorder predictors also does not produce high—
quality predictions. This is likely because neither UMA nor predictors
of ﬂexibility provide accurate estimates for the disordered regions.
Overall, we conclude that while currently there are no approaches
that can accurately predict DFLs, our DFLpred offers such accurate
predictions.

We also evaluate the considered methods separately for inter— and
intra—domain residues, see Supplementary Table S2. DFLpred can ac—
curately predict DFLs both inside and outside of domains, with AUC
: 0.72 and 0.73 and Ratio : 3.3 and 3.8, respectively. These results
are significantly better than the results of all other considered meth—
ods. The UMA method has substantially higher AUC for prediction of
DFLs outside of domains compared with the results for residues local—
ized inside the domains. This difference reﬂects the fact that ﬂexible
linkers that are targeted by UMA are localized between domains. On
the other hand, ﬂexibility predictors secure slightly better predictive
quality for residues in domains compared with the residues outside
the domains. Finally, disorder predictors are equally inaccurate for
both inter— and intra—domain residues and the best combinations of
ﬂexibility predictors and disorder predictors work better inside the
domains. The latter is perhaps because these combinations use
PredyFlexy predictors that perform better inside the domains.

We plot ROC curves for all methods for which the AUC > 0.52
based on the evaluations on the entire test dataset and separately for
the inter— and intra—domain residues, see Figure 3. Supplementary
Figure S3 shows the ROC curves in larger format for methods with
the AUC > 0.5. We also include the result when using sequence
alignment. The alignment—based predictor copies DFL annotations
of aligned residues from the most similar sequence in the training
dataset based on its alignment to a query sequence from the test
dataset. The alignment is done with PSI—BLAST using default par—
ameters (Altschul et (11., 1997). Because alignment transfers binary
annotations of DFLs from the training proteins, we can show only
one point for the ROC curve for this simple predictor. The FPR and
TPR values of alignment—based predictors equal 0.039 and 0.014,
respectively. In other words, it predicts only 1.4% of DFL residues
with the cost of predicting 3.9% of NDFL residues as DFL residues.
This is because our test dataset is designed to share low (25% or
lower) sequence similarity with the training dataset. In contrast,
DFLpred can produce high—quality results even in the absence of se—
quence similarity. When considering the same FPR : 0.039,
DFLpred’s TRP is 10 times higher and equals 0.148. Moreover,
DFLpred’s ROC curves are substantially above the curves of other
methods over the entire range of FPR values. We also note a large
improvement for the low FPR values (see insert in Fig. 3).

3.3 Relation between predicted propensity and
predictive quality

DFLpred outputs real—valued propensities for each residue in the in—
put protein chain where higher values of propensity denote higher
likelihood that a given residue is a part of a DFL. Figure 4 shows

by calculating fraction of residues in native DFLs (black line) and
native NDFLs (gray line), which are predicted with propensities
below a value shown on the x—axis. Larger vertical separation be—
tween the two lines corresponds to a better separation between
DFLs and NDFLs by outputs produced with DFLpred. The propen—
sities generated by DFLpred are constrained to the 0—0.3 range and
offer a large separation. We picked two representative values of pro—
pensities (vertical dotted lines in Fig. 3) to demonstrate how to inter—
pret DFLpred’s predictions. Half of the NDFLs are found among the
residues predicted with propensity < 0.07, while these residues in—
clude only about 20% of DFLs. Similarly, half of DFLs and only
20% of NDFLs are found among the residues for which the pre—
dicted propensity >0.12.

3.4 Runtime

DFLpred is implemented as a linear function of features computed
directly from sequence and from sequence—derived predictions gener—
ated with IUPred. IUPred’s predictions are calculated from pairwise
energy profile without a time—consuming alignment or predictive
model. Consequently, DFLpred is fast.

We quantify and compare DFLpred’s runtime with the runtime
of UMA and all individual methods that obtained AUC > 0.5 in
Table 2 or Supplementary Table S2. The predictions were run on the
same 64—bit computer with 3.5 GHZ CPU and 4 GB of RAM run—
ning Ubuntu operating system. UMA is run manually and requires
computation of hydrophobicity, finding homologous sequences and
prediction of secondary structure. We estimate a lower bound on
the UMA’s runtime by computing time to complete the most time—
consuming finding of homologs. This is based on executing BLAST
against the NR database using the suggested by the author e—value :
1e—20. We used stand—alone version of PredyFlexy that was provided
by the authors. FlexPred and PredBF do not provide stand—alone ver—
sions but both methods use PSI—BLAST to generate position—specific
scoring matrix against the NR database. We use this calculation to
estimate lower bounds of their runtime. As suggested by the authors,
we compute the runtime of running PSI—BLAST with five iterations
and default e—value for FlexPred, and with three iterations and
e—value : 0.001 for PredBF. We did not include ThreaDom because
it requires running LOMETS (Local Meta—Threading—Server) frame—
work, which takes substantially longer time than the other methods.
We collected the runtime of the considered methods for 204 proteins
from the training and test datasets. We sorted the proteins by their

base 10 logarithmic scale. Lines denote linear fits into the measured data that
are shown using markers

size quantified with the sequence length, divided them into 10
equally sized groups based on the size and computed average run—
time for each group.

Figure 5 compares the average runtime against the average
length of sequences for the five methods. The runtime of DFLpred,
Espritz_NMR, PredyFlexy, UMA, FlexPred and PredBF is in the
range of 102, 102 to 103, 104 to 105, 105 to 106 and 106, respect—
ively, measured in milliseconds. DFLpred is up to 4 orders of magni—
tude faster than the alternatives, which is a significant advantage.
To put this into perspective, if these methods would be used to pre—
dict the complete reviewed human proteome from UniProt (20 193
sequences with an average length of 561), DFLpred, ESpritz,
PredyFlexy, UMA, FlexPred and PredBF would take about 40 min,
80min, 11.5 days, 185 days, 231.5 days and 231.5 days, respect—
ively. This estimate is based on a linear fit into the measured data
that are shown in Figure 5 and assuming use of the same computer
that we used to measure the runtime. The measured runtime of
DFLpred on the human proteomes using this computer was 38 min,
which is close to the estimated 40min and which demonstrates that
our estimates are accurate. To summarize, DFLpred is faster than
the less accurate alternatives and is capable of providing predictions
for the complete human proteome (and any other proteome, which
by definition, would be smaller) using a modern personal computer

in under an hour.

3.5 Analysis of putative DFLs in human proteome

We analyzed putative annotations of DFLs generated with DFLpred
in the complete reviewed human proteome collected from UniProt.
We considered a given residue to form DFL is its propensity gener—
ated by DFLpred > 0.18. This cutoff corresponds to low 0.05 FPR
based on the results from the cross—validation on the training
dataset.

Figure 6A shows a histogram of the content of putative DFLs
residues per sequence (fraction of these residues in a sequence).
About 24% of proteins have no DFLs, i.e. the content is <5%, while
our estimated FPR is at the same level, and another 52% have small
amount of DFL residues. About 10% and 1.8% of proteins have the
content >30% and >50%, respectively. We found 341 and 152 pro—
teins that have the content of DFL residues at >50% and 60%,
respectively.

and length (panel B) and lines show the cumulative fraction for a given range
of the content (panel A) and length (panel B)

Figure 6B is a histogram of the length of putative DFLs. Most of
these regions are relatively short, with about 80% of them being
shorter than 10 residues; some of them could be spurious predictions
given the assumed 5% FPR. However, about 7% and 2.6% of these
regions span at least 20 and 30 consecutive residues, respectively.
We found 6029 DFL regions that that are at least 30 residues long.

3.6 Webserver

DFLpred is freely available as a webserver at http://biomine.ece.ual
berta.ca/DFLpred. It requires the end user only to provide the input
protein sequence(s) in FASTA format and email address. The email
is used to deliver a notification of the finished prediction and URL
of results that are available for download. The same information is
available in the browser window given that this window will not be
closed until the prediction is finished. The server automatically gen—
erates the corresponding propensities and binary predictions (DFL
versus NDFL residue). The binary predictions are computed from
the propensities using the cutoff : 0.18 (residues with propensity
> 0.18 are assumed to form DFLs), which corresponds to the 5%
FPR. The webserver allows for batch predictions of datasets with up
to 5000 proteins.

4 Summary

We conceptualized, designed, tested and deployed a novel computa—
tional method, DFLpred, for the prediction of the DFLs from pro—
tein sequences. We developed four strong and complementary
sequence—derived markers of DFLs and combined them using a lin—
ear function to build DFLpred. Empirical tests on independent

(blind) test dataset demonstrated that our method provides relatively
accurate predictions even for proteins that share low sequence iden—
tity. DFLpred outperformed the closest related methods including
UMA, which predicts flexible linkers, several protein ﬂexibility pre—
dictors and their combinations with disorder predictors. We note
that the value of AUC : 0.72 secured by DFLpred is affected by the
challenging nature of the dataset (proteins in this dataset share low,
<25%, identity with the training sequences) and the fact that the an—
notations of DFLs could be incomplete. In other words, results on
proteins that share larger sequences similarity with our training
dataset should be better and some of the false positives in our test
dataset could in fact corresponds to DFLs that are yet to be anno—
tated. Another potential issue is the precision with which the boun—
daries of DFLs are annotated. This is shown in our first example
(Supplementary Fig. S2A) where the boundaries of domains are
slightly misaligned with the boundaries of DFLs. This will result in
annotation noise that reduces the achievable limit of predictive per—
formance. Our prediction is also characterized by a low runtime,
with prediction of the entire proteome taking <1 h on a modern
desktop computer. Finally, our analysis of putative DFLs in human
proteome generated with DFLpred shows that DFLs likely can be
found in many human proteins. About 10% of human proteins have
a significant content of >30% of DFL residues and a few thousand
of these regions are >30 consecutive residues.

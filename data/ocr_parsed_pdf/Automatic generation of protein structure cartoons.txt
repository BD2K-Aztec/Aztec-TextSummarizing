ABSTRACT

Summary: Protein topology diagrams are 2D representations of
protein structure that are particularly useful in understanding and
analysing complex protein folds. Generating such diagrams presents
a major problem in graph drawing, with automatic approaches
often resulting in errors or uninterpretable results. Here we apply
a breakthrough in diagram layout to protein topology cartoons,
providing clear, accurate, interactive and editable diagrams, which
are also an interface to a structural search method.

Comparisons between structurally related proteins are aided by
simpliﬁed topology maps of protein structure [e.g. TOPS cartoons
(Westhead et (11., 1999)]. Such diagrams are particularly useful when
comparing very distantly related folds [e.g. Rosado et a1. (2007)].
The automatic generation of such cartoons is a challenging problem,
requiring as it does the simpliﬁcation of a complex 3D object
into a 2D representation, with the (often competing) requirements
of correctness, maximizing the amount of information conveyed,
ease of comprehension and aesthetic appeal. To the best of our
knowledge, there are three existing systems for the automatic
generation of such diagrams from atomic co-ordinates in PDB
ﬁles. HERA (Hutchinson and Thornton, 1990) generates detailed
hydrogen-bonding diagrams. TOPS generates topological cartoons
with a ‘top-down’ View in a style similar to the hand-drawn diagrams
of Sternberg and Thornton (1977). A recent addition to the PDB sum
website (Laskowski, 2009) generates topology diagrams for protein
domains in an ‘exploded’ style derived from HERA. These styles
of diagram are not always sufﬁcient for the purposes of structural
biologists and in particular do not accurately convey the relative
position of ﬂ-sheets and a-helices. One solution is to draw suitable
diagrams manually, and the TopDraw program (Bond, 2003) is a
simple diagram editor designed to aid the manual drawing of protein

secondary structure elements (SSEs).

Pro-origami is an approach for automatically generating protein
structure cartoons in a systematic fashion, similar to those that
might be manually produced via human cognition and depicted
using TopDraw. ﬂ-strands and a-helices are drawn as arrows and
cylinders, respectively, proportional in length to the number of
residues they contain. ﬂ-sheets are shown as groups of ﬂ-strands
positioned relative to each other according to their actual relative
positions (Fig. 1). Most importantly, Pro-origami provides a solution
to the most complex part of the problem; achieving a layout that

remains comprehensible while maintaining as much of the 3D
structural information as possible.

The ﬁrst stage of the Pro-origami process is, optionally, to
decompose the protein into domains, using either a CATH (Pearl
et al., 2005) CDF ﬁle or the DDOMAIN program (Zhou et al.,
2007). Secondary structure is determined using either the secondary
structure assignments in the PDB ﬁle, or the DSSP (Kabsch and
Sander, 1983) or STRIDE (Frishman and Argos, 1995) programs,
from which hydrogen bond information is also obtained. Constraints
derived include groupings of strands within sheets and the relative
positions of strands in a sheet, separation between adjacent strands
in a sheet, and the alignment of strands and helices on horizontal
or vertical axes. ﬂ-strands are grouped into sheets using algorithms
similar to those employed by TOPS, making use of hydrogen bond
and 3D geometrical information. ﬂ-barrels are displayed ‘ﬂattened’
into sheets by breaking the bridge relationship between two of the
strands. These strands are marked in the cartoon to indicate this
situation. Sheets are positioned relative to each other according to the
contact map and tableau (Kamat and Lesk, 2007) computed for the
protein, which deﬁnes the relative orientation of secondary structure
elements. Helices are positioned using a heuristic which attempts to
make the diagram as easy as possible to read, usually by placing
them aligned on the axis of the closest strand.

The initial positions of the cartoon elements and the set of
constraints and connectors are used as the input to the Dunnart
constraint-based diagram editor (Dwyer et al., 2009). Dunnart then
lays out the diagram according to the constraints, with specialized
coding to ensure that elements do not overlap. Connectors between
the elements are routed so as to not collide with elements and to try
to reduce unnecessary crossings (Wybrow et al., 2010).

The Pro-origami web server allows diagrams to be generated from
any PDB ﬁle, and a copy of the PDB (Berman et al., 2000) is stored
on the server. Alternatively, a PDB ﬁle may be uploaded to the server.
The resulting diagram may be either downloaded or viewed as an
SVG or bitmap ﬁle. For browsers that support JavaScript and SVG,
the diagram is interactive, showing the residue at the part of the
diagram over which the mouse pointer is positioned.

In addition to providing protein structure cartoons, Pro-origami
acts as a user interface to a protein substructure searching algorithm
(Stivala et al., 2009). The user can select a set of SSEs on the cartoon
to act as a motif query, and have the matching SSEs highlighted in
the Pro-origami cartoons of the matched structures.

One of the aims of Pro-origami is to make cartoons easy to
interpret visually. One of the criteria for easy interpretation is that
the sequence of helices and strands should be easy to follow by
eye along the connectors, and Pro-origami attempts to minimize the
number of cases in which connectors run too close to each other, a
situation we describe as a connector ‘overlap’, which Pro-origami
detects and attempts to correct automatically. We ran Pro-origami
on a database of non-redundant protein domains, resulting in a total
of 16602 cartoons. Pro-origami produces a cartoon with at least
one ‘overlap’ for only 2.29% of these domains. On our server (Dell
PowerEdge R200), the average time taken to generate a cartoon in
this set is 2.3 s.

Pro-origami automates the process of generating protein topology
diagrams, showing the relative size of strands and helices, the
alignment of strands in a sheet and the general positioning of sheets
and helices with respect to one another. Such information is not
completely conveyed by the topological style of TOPS cartoons or
HERA (PDB sum) diagrams. Our approach also reduces unnecessary
connector crossings and generates diagrams that are interactively
editable with an editor (Dunnart). The latter approach permits
preservation of meaningful constraints such as the positions of
strands in a sheet, and the connectors between SSEs, while the
user edits the diagram. Pro-origami also allows interactive graphical
construction of queries to a protein substructural search system.

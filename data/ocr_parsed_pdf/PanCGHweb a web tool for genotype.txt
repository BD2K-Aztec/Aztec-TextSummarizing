ABSTRACT

Summary: A pangenome is the total of genes present in
strains of the same species. Pangenome microarrays allow
determining the genomic content of bacterial strains more accurately
than conventional comparative genome hybridization microarrays.
PanCGHweb is the first tool that effectively calls genotype based
on pangenome microarray data.

Availability: PanCGHweb, the web tool is accessible from:

1 INTRODUCTION

Pangenome microarrays contain probes that target all known genes
within related strains of the same species (Tettelin et (11., 2005).When
compared to conventional comparative genome hybridization
(CGH) microarrays that target the gene content of a single species,
they allow to more accurately determine the genotype of a given
bacterial strain (Bayjanov et (11., 2009; Castellanos et (11., 2009;
Willenbrock et (11., 2007). In pangenomes, orthologous genes can
be deﬁned as homologous genes derived by a strain divergence
event from a single ancestral sequence. These orthologous genes
(strain orthologs) share different levels of nucleotide sequence
identity with paralogous genes (homologous genes derived by a
duplication event from a single sequence) (Fitch, 1970). Effective
genotyping can be achieved by grouping genes into ortholog
groups (OGs) and subsequently genotyping at the level of OGs.
Recently, we published an algorithm (PanCGH) that effectively
deals with assigning OG presence/absence to each strain analyzed by
pangenome microarrays (Bayjanov et (11., 2009). Here, we describe
a web tool—PanCGHweb—that uses this algorithm to effectively
genotype strains based on pangenome microarray data.

2 METHODS

2.1 Implementation

PanCGHweb is implemented in Python and R, and its wizard-like
web-interface is generated by the FG-web framework (S.A.F.T.Van Hijum
et (11., unpublished data). There are three major sections in the

web-interface: (i) data upload; (ii) parameter settings; and (iii) displaying
the results (Fig. 1A). The web tool works with major web browsers such as
Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Opera.

2.2 Input data

Open reading frame sequences for each reference bacterial strain and/or
plasmid, on which probes were designed, should be provided by (i)
selecting from the available daily updated Genbank sequences and (ii)
optionally, uploading FASTA-formatted DNA sequences that are absent in
the Genbank list. Normalized microarray hybridization data, where replicated
measurements are represented by a single value (e.g. by averaging), should
also be provided as tab-delimited ﬁle(s). Probe sequences should be provided
in FASTA format.

2.3 Algorithm

The PanCGH algorithm calls presence/absence of OGs based on pangenome
microarray data. PanCGHweb performs the following steps: (i) orthology
grouping; (ii) alignment of probes to genes; and (iii) genotype calling.

Step I: Inparanoid (Remm et (11., 2001) is used with its default settings
(minimum bit score of 50 and conﬁdence score of 0.25) for the orthology
prediction among genes of the selected reference genomes (Genbank ﬁles;
see above). The run time of Inparanoid is reduced by a few orders of
magnitudes by adapting the software to use BLAT (Kent, 2002) for sequence
alignments. Genes that are not part of the selected reference genomes can be
grouped based on their homology, or each gene can form a separate group.

Step 2: the microarray probes are aligned by BLAT to the individual gene
members of each OG. Probes that could not be aligned to any gene and genes
with no matching probes are reported.

Step 3: using the PanCGH algorithm (Bayjanov et (11., 2009) the
ﬂuorescence signal intensities of probes associated to each gene are
summarized to a gene score (the most frequently occurring signal intensity).
The maximum of gene scores of all gene members of an OG is used as
the presence score for that OG. An OG is considered to be present if its
presence score is above the threshold of 5.5 in log scale. The steps involved
in determining the optimal threshold value are described on the web site of
PanCGHweb.

2.4 Output of the algorithm

Results of PanCGHweb include: (i) projection plot, which overlays
presence/absence of OGs on the selected genomes; (ii) histogram of presence
score of OGs for any reference strain, which can be used to validate whether
the default threshold of 5.5 is an optimal choice for presence/absence calling
(Fig. 1B); (iii) receiver operating curves using all possible presence/absence
calling thresholds for all reference strains; (iv) two different phylogenetic
trees of strains, one based on presence/absence values and the other based
on presence scores. Such trees enable estimating the genomic diversity

3 CONCLUSIONS

For genotyping, pangenome microarrays offer a cost-effective
alternative to DNA sequencing and allow to more accurately
determine genomic content compared to standard CGH techniques.
We have developed a web tool for pangenome microarray analysis
based on our PanCGH algorithm. It enables researchers to analyze
these complex hybridization data in a facile and transparent way to
understand genomic diversity among related strains.

2.2. Correlation on the scale of liability is approximately
the same as that on the observed risk scale

For disease traits when the y phenotype vectors contain only 1 for cases
and 0 for controls, a liability threshold model can be written to link
unobserved continuous liability to the observed discrete scale of disease
(Falconer, 1965)

l=g*+e* (1)

where l is a vector of liability phenotypes which are distributed as N(0, 1)
in the population, g* is a vector of random additive genetic effects on the
liability scale which are distributed N (0, 02*) and e* is a vector of random
residuals on the liability scale distributed with N(0, 03*). The probit link
function links liability to the probability of y = 1, and g* on the scale of
liability can be approximated by a linear function of g on the observed
071 scale (Dempster and Lerner, 1950). Using this linear approximation,
the correlation between two diseases is the same on both the observed and
liability scale (Gianola, 1982; Hoschele et al., 1987). When samples are
ascertained (typical in casecontrol studies), the genetic value on the
observed scale can be defined with an ascertainment correcting factor
as (Lee et al., 2011)
N P(1 — P) *

gL.C=c+zmg , (2)
where g“. is genetic values on the observed scale in a casewontrol study,
6 is a constant, K is the disease prevalence in the population, P is the
proportion of the sample that are cases and z is the height of the standard
normal probability density function that truncates the proportion
K. From equation (2), the covariance between genetic values on the
observed scale with ascertained samples can be written as

P1(1—P1) P2(1—P2)

K10 — K1)“ K2(1 — K2)C°V(gl’g§)' (3)

C(“,(gccl aged) g 21

From equation (3) it is clear that that even when samples are ascer-

tained, the correlation is the same on both observed and liability scales,

because an approximate linear relationship exists between the genetic
values on the different scales.

2.3. Simulation study

In order to conﬁrm the derivation that the genetic correlation is approxi-
mately the same on both observed and liability scales when samples are
ascertained, we performed a simulation study. The simulation procedure
was similar to that in Lee et a]. (2011) except that two traits were simu-
lated with a genetic correlation between them (described in the
Supplementary material).

2.4. Application to genome-wide genotype data

We applied our method to estimate genetic correlation between HT and
T2D, BD and RA, BD and T2D, or HT and RA using WTCCC GWAS
data (WTCCC, 2007), following stringent quality control (QC) as
described in the supplementary material. Since there are two control
groups in the WTCCC data, i.e. 1958 cohort controls and NBS controls,
we used 1958 cohort controls for the ﬁrst trait, and NBS controls for the
second trait. In a conﬁrmation study, we swapped the control groups i.e.
NBS for the ﬁrst trait and 1958 cohort for the second trait.

We estimated a test statistic by dividing the square of the estimated
genetic correlation coefﬁcient by its approximate sampling variance and
calculated a p-value from this test statistic assuming that it is distributed
as a chi-square with 1 degree of freedom.

3 RESULTS

In simulations the estimated genetic correlation on the observed
scale was close to the true values when using various
combinations of true heritability and population prevalence
(Supplementary Table $1). This conﬁrms that the estimated gen—
etic correlation is approximately the same on both observed and
liability scales [Equation (3)]. Previously we have shown that if
misdiagnosis occurs between the two disorders, then the expect—
ation of the estimate of the genetic correlation coefﬁcient can be
non—zero even when the true genetic correlation is zero (Wray
et al., 2012).

The estimated genetic correlation between HT and T2D was
0.31 (SE = 0.14 and p—value = 0.023) (Supplementary Table S2),
indicating that genetic factors for HT and T2D are positively
correlated. However, estimates for genetic correlation between
BD and RA, BD and T2D, or HT and RA were not signiﬁcantly
different from zero (Supplementary Table S2). In a conﬁrmation
study switching control groups between the ﬁrst and second trait
(Supplementary Table S2), the genetic correlation between
HT and T2D was 0.32 (SE=O.14 and P=0.024). Again, none
of other analyses had significant genetic correlations
(Supplementary Table S2). None of the parameter estimates dif—
fered signiﬁcantly between our original and conﬁrmation ana—
lyses. We previously demonstrated that the application of our
stringent QC process resulted in estimated genetic variance not
signiﬁcantly different from zero if we conduct a dummy
case—control analysis using these two control sets but treating
one set as a cases (Lee et al., 2011) (h2=0.06, SE 0.11).

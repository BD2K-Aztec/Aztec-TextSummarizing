ABSTRACT

Summary: There is an immediate need for tools to both analyse and
visualize in real-time single-nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and
deletions, and other structural variants from new sequence file for-
mats. We have developed VarB software that can be used to visualize
variant call format files in real time, as well as identify regions under
balancing selection and informative markers to differentiate
user-defined groups (e.g. populations). We demonstrate its utility
using sequence data from 50 Plasmodium falciparum isolates com-
prising two different continents and confirm known signals from gen-
omic regions that contain important antigenic and anti-malarial
drug-resistance genes.

Availability and implementation: The C++-based software VarB and
user manual are available from www.pathogenseq.org/varb.

1 INTRODUCTION

Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies are providing
whole-genome data on organisms that cause or have disease.
These data are being used to catalogue genomic diversity, and
in the context of research in humans, inform genome-wide and
ﬁne-scale mapping projects. The technologies are capable of
sequencing a small number of human genomes in a single run,
making high throughput of human genomes technically possible.
Pathogen genomes are much smaller, making them tractable for
large genome diversity studies, enabling the tracking of their
evolution over time and space. They are also more amenable
for whole-genome association studies, leading to the identiﬁca-
tion of variants associated with phenotypes such as drug resist-
ance. To take full advantage of genetic variation exposed
by whole-genome sequencing across pathogen (and other)

organisms, the development of interactive analysis and real-time
Visualization tools is essential.

The variant call format (VCF) has become the recognized data
type for listing genomic variants, including single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (indels),
usually derived from processing alignment files. The VCF
format was developed by the 1000 Genomes project and has
been adopted by large-scale genome projects [e.g. UKlOK,
dbSNP (Danecek et al., 2011)]. It facilitates multi-sample
curation and identification of SNPs, short indels and other
types of structural variants and sample meta-data. The software
suite VCFtools implement utilities for processing files (Danecek
et al., 2011). Software to Visualize VCF files is available (Carver
et al., 2012; Fiume et al., 2010; Thorvaldsdttir et a]. 2012), but
they perform limited or no population and statistical genetic
analyses in real time directly from multi-sample files. New
tools are urgently required because of the increasing use of
MP8 technologies in genomic epidemiological studies, and the
need to rapidly translate the sequence variation into further
experiments. This need has motivated the development of an
all-in-one variant browsing and analysis softwareiVarB.

2 FEATURES OF VarB

VarB is a standalone C++ software tool, which Visualizes
(un)phased polymorphisms in a VCF ﬁle by sample, genetic
region and quality. The basic inputs are a reference genome
(fasta), variant (V CF) and annotation (gff) files. Complete
genomes or user-speciﬁed regions (e.g. chromosome) may be
inputted and Viewed, with variant genotypes being colour
coded. The variants displayed and their number will change
depending on the quality and read depth filtering selected,
allowing users to assess the robustness of the data and analysis.
Sequence data with genes, exons, coding regions and strand-
dependent codons are marked at appropriate zoom levels,
and tracks summarizing GC content, relative variant density
and results from data analysis are presented. The
Tajimas D metric (Td) (Tajima, 1989) is implemented and is a
method for distinguishing between a DNA sequence evolving
randomly (‘neutrally’, values close to 0) and one evolving

under a non-random process, including directional selection (low
negative values) or balancing selection (high positive values). The
population differentiation Fst measure is also implemented
(Weir, 1996) and quantiﬁes allele frequency differences between
user-speciﬁed populations, with values ranging between
0 (no difference) and 1 (complete differentiation). It is possible
to export the graphics and analysis outputs. VarB was developed
using the Qt cross-platform and user interface framework

(qt-project. org).

3 APPLICATION TO PLASMODIUM
FALCIPARUM DATA

We demonstrate the functionality of VarB using P. falciparum
(Pf) whole-genome (14 chromosomes, 23 Mb, ~81% AT con-
tent) sequence data from Burkina Faso (BF, 11:25) and
Thailand (11 = 25). The raw data are from a Pf genomic diversity
study (Manske et al., 2012; SRA Study ERP000190). The
Illumina 54/76-base paired reads were mapped to the 3D7 ref-
erence genome (V3.0) using smalt (www.sanger.ac.uk/smalt) and
processed as described previously (Robinson et al., 2011) to con-
struct VCF (V4.1) ﬁles consisting of SNPs and indels. Across the
50 samples, 46 283 SNPs (density 1 every 500 bp) were identiﬁed
and summarized in a combined VCF file. We focus on those
23 942 (51.7%) SNPs with minor alleles observed at least twice.
Figure 1 (top) shows the SNP data (It: 1790 loci, 7.5%) for
chromosome 10. Estimation of Td identified a large region
(positioned ~1.4 Mb), potentially under balancing selection
(Td>2). This region includes highly polymorphic antigenic-
determining genes from the merozoite surface protein 3 family
[msp3 (PF10_0345); msp3.8 (PF10_0355)], known to be under
diversifying selection, and considered potential vaccine candi-
dates (Ochola et al., 2010). By specifying the two population
groups (BF and Thailand), the population differentiation meas-
ure Fst was calculated. There were 1153 (4.8%) SNPs with near
or complete population differentiation (Fst values>0.95) across
the genome. Loci involved in anti-malarial drug resistance often
show high differentiation (W ootton et al., 2002). Figure 1
(bottom) shows one region of interest in chromosome 7 contain-
ing the chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT, MAL7.1.27,
maximum Fst 0.92). This locus is known to confer resistance to
anti-malarial chloroquine-based drugs, with established differ-
ences in the haplotype structure between Southeast Asian and
African isolates (Wootton et al., 2002). Other polymorphisms
known to confer sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance,
namely regions around PfDHFR and PfDHPS genes (Pearce
et al., 2009) had high Fst values (>0.80) (data not shown).

4 DISCUSSION

The translation of sequence variation into further laboratory
experiments, treatments and point of care interventions, requires
the ability to interrogate genomic data. VarB processes ﬁles of
VCF format, displays the variants by position and quality as well
as comparing them between groups to establish informative gen-
etic markers and regions under selection. An advantage of the
software is that it performs population and statistical analysis in
real-time and does not require calculations to be performed
elsewhere. We have presented data from 50 Pf isolates to

demonstrate the utility of the software and highlighted regions
with differing allele frequencies that coincide with known
drug-resistance loci (e. g. PfCRT) as well as known vaccine can-
didates arising from considering regions under balancing selec-
tion (e. g. msp3.8). It is possible to process many hundreds of Pf
or smaller genomes (e.g. bacterial) simultaneously. However, to
aid processing of numerous much larger genomes, such as
human, the software is capable of reading in single chromo-
somes. The modular computing architecture provides the ﬂexi-
bility to incorporate a number of extensions. These include the
capacity to process BCF/BCF2 files, reading in informative meta
tracks (e.g. genomic uniqueness), calculating other population
genetic statistics and performing tests of association with a
phenotype. Increased utility will also be possible through updates
to the VCF format, to identify and annotate variants of greater
size, such as large deletions.

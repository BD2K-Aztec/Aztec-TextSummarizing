ABSTRACT

Summary: We introduce CoNtRoI, a web-based framework for ana-
lysis of chemical reaction networks (CRNs). It is designed to be both
extensible and simple to use, complementing existing CRN-related
tools. CoNtRoI currently implements a number of necessary and/or
sufficient structural tests for multiple equilibria, stable periodic orbits,
convergence to equilibria and persistence, with the potential for
incorporation of further tests.

Availability and implementation: Reference implementation: reac-
tion-networks.net/control/. Source code and binaries, released under
the GPLv3: reaction-networks.net/controI/download/. Documentation:

1 INTRODUCTION

Differential equation models of chemical reaction networks
(CRNs), encompassing many ecological, epidemiological and
related non-negative systems, are almost universally complicated
by parameter uncertainty. However, dynamical properties of
large classes of CRN models are remarkably robust to changes
in parameter values, leading to a range of results relating net-
work structure to dynamical behavior. Such parameter-free
approaches to the analysis of CRNs fall into the scope of chem-
ical reaction network theory (Horn and Jackson, 1972; Feinberg,
1972, 1979). Fuelled in part by its implications to systems biology
(Bailey, 2001; Shinar and Feinberg, 2010), chemical reaction net-
work theory has seen a surge of interest in recent years, attacking
questions about multistationarity (Craciun et al., 2006; Conradi
et al., 2007; Banaji et al., 2007; Banaji and Craciun, 2009; Shinar
and Feinberg, 2012), global stability (Craciun et al., 2009; Angeli
et al., 2010; Anderson, 2011; Donnell and Banaji, 2013), oscilla-
tory behavior (Angeli et al., 2014) and persistence (Angeli et al.,
2007; Pantea, 2012).

Many of the results in chemical reaction network theory lend
themselves to algorithmic implementation, which is useful for
large networks. In this article, we introduce CoNtRol (CRN
tool), a new, fully open source platform, currently coded in C,
Java, Octave and PHP, to perform computations on CRNs with-
out the need for any proprietary software. CoNtRol has a

web-based front-end interfacing with a suite of modular tests,
to which users may add new tests in any language. With its
array of features, CoNtRol complements existing software
tools. The Chemical Reaction Network Toolbox (Ellison et al.,
2011) is a proprietary Windows program that implements the
results of deﬁciency theory (Feinberg, 1979), as well as checks
for concordance (Shinar and Feinberg, 2012), equivalent to net-
work injectivity. It applies to various types of kinetics, including
mass action, and generates detailed information about network
properties, multiple and degenerate steady states and their sta-
bility. Reaction Network Equilibria Study Toolbox (ERNEST)
(Soranzo and Altaﬁni, 2009) and CRNreals (Szederkenyi et al.,
2012) are MATLAB toolboxes aimed at testing multistationar-
ity, and distinguishability and identiﬁability of CRNs, respect-
ively. Tests for multistationarity of CRNs are also implemented
in Maple (Feliu and Wiuf, 2013). While not all criteria included
in these tools are currently tested in CoNtRol, its extensible
nature allows for their future inclusion.

2 FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY

CoNtRol has an intuitive user interface where a list of reactions
can be input manually or uploaded in a variety of formats. While
the focus so far has been on developing the framework for
extensible functionality, a number of tools for the analysis of
CRNs have also been implemented and tested.

2.1 Network analysis

The current functionality of CoNtRol includes a number of ne-
cessary and/or sufﬁcient structural tests for multiple equilibria,
stable oscillation, convergence to equilibria and persistence,
assuming mass action or more general kinetics. In particular,
the following are checked: sufﬁcient conditions for convergence
to equilibria based on the theory of monotone dynamical systems
(Angeli et al., 2010; Donnell and Banaji, 2013); conditions of the
deﬁciency zero and deﬁciency one theorems (Feinberg, 1987),
resulting in claims about local stability of equilibria, absence of
multiple positive equilibria and absence of periodic orbits, pri-
marily for mass action kinetics; structural conditions for persist-
ence (Angeli et al., 2007; Donnell and Banaji, 2013) based on
examining the siphons of the system; and a large number
of sufﬁcient/necessary conditions for injectivity and absence of
multistationarity gathered from the literature and developed
in (Banaji and Pantea, 2013). The outputs are cross-referenced

to the documentation of CoNtRol, where each conclusion and its
implications are described in detail. Some of the multistationarity
results of CoNtRol are similar to those of the Chemical Reaction
Network Toolbox (Ellison et al, 2011).

2.2 DSR graph generation

A useful tool in the parameter-free study of CRNs is the directed
species-reaction (DSR) graph: a bipartite graph with signed,
labeled and sometimes directed edges. CoNtRol includes a
Java Web Start application for drawing DSR graphs. The
graph layout is highly customizable, and the ‘export to
LATEX’ feature generates TikZ code for the resulting DSR dia-
gram. An example is illustrated in Figure 1. Easily checked struc-
tural conditions on the DSR graph can imply, or contribute
toward, powerful conclusions regarding multistationarity,
asymptotic stability or oscillatory behavior in a CRN (Craciun
et al, 2006; Banaji and Craciun, 2009; Angeli et al, 2010, 2014;
Shinar and Feinberg, 2013). Several of these are implemented or
lend themselves naturally to future implementation.

2.3 Batch processing

This feature allows users to analyze a number of networks in a
single run, thus generating statistics about the occurrence of cer-
tain behaviors. An archive containing individual files describing
each network is uploaded, and the user is emailed a link to the
output once it is complete. For example, Table 1 summarizes the
results of some injectivity tests implemented in CoNtRol, applied
to the database of all 4082 non-isomorphic bimolecular CRNs
with three species and three reactions (Deckard et al, 2009).

2.4 Miscellaneous

A number of features that further improve usability have been
implemented. These include multiple input formats, the option to
receive the output Via email and automatic generation of
LATEX code (e. g. list of reactions, stoichiometric matrix).

GK, general kinetics; MA, mass action kinetics; or, the system is injective on the
relative interior of each non—trivial stoichiometry class; ,8, the fully open system is
injective on the non—negative orthant. For example, with mass action kinetics, 45%
(MAa) of the networks was injective on the relative interior on each non—trivial
stoichiometric class, only slightly more than with general kinetics (GKOI). See
(Banaji and Pantea, 2013) for more details.

3 CONCLUSION

We have written CoNtRol aiming for a user-friendly tool with
maximal functionality, implementing state-of-the—art theory on
CRNs. We expect future inclusion of further results from the
rich theory of CRNs, with contributions from the research
community.

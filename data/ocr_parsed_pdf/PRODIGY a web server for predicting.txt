Abstract

Summary: Gaining insights into the structural determinants of protein—protein interactions holds
the key for a deeper understanding of biological functions, diseases and development of thera—
peutics. An important aspect of this is the ability to accurately predict the binding strength for
a given protein—protein complex. Here we present PROtein binDlng enerGY prediction (PRODIGY),
a web server to predict the binding affinity of protein—protein complexes from their 3D structure.
The PRODIGY server implements our simple but highly effective predictive model based on inter—
molecular contacts and properties derived from non—interface surface.

Availability and Implementation: PRODIGY is freely available at: http://mi|ou.science.uu.n|/ser

Recently, we introduced a simple and robust descriptor of binding
affinity based only on structural properties of a protein—protein com—
plex. Using the protein—protein binding affinity benchmark in
Kastritis et al. (201 1), we demonstrated that the number of interfacial

which defines whether complex formation occurs or not in specific
conditions, holds the key to control interactions (e.g. engineering
high affinity interactions), design new therapeutics (e.g. guiding
rational drug design) or predict the impact of mutations at protein
interfaces. The prediction of binding affinity has been investigated for
decades (Chothia and Janin, 1975; Horton and Lewis, 1992) yielding
approaches ranging from exact methods (e.g. free energy perturb—

its experimental binding affinity. This information, combined with

Fig. 1. Example output of PRODIGY for the complex between the FAB and the
HIV-1 capsid protein p24 (PDB code: 1E6J). A 3D representation of the com-
plex interface is shown in the inset figure with the color coding of the
PRODIGY script (.pml) for Pymol: aquamarine and yellow for Interactor 1
(chains L and H in this example) and Interactor 2 (chain P), respectively. The
interacting residues are represented in darker colors with their side-chains
showed in sticks

reported so far. In terms of accuracy, our method showed a Pearson’s
Correlation coefficient of 0.73 between the predicted and measured
binding affinity on the benchmark (P—value <0.0001) and Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.89 kcal mol’1 (Vangone and
Bonvin, 2015). While our method performs well on average, errors in
particular cases may be expected; for instance, some natural ultra—
high—affinity complexes have average or below—average buried surface
area, and our method may underestimate their affinity. Alternative
physical models of entropy, solvent effects and electrostatics could be
taken into consideration to address such cases, although, to date, no
such model performs better on average than our simple contact—based
approach (see Fig. 4 in Vangone and Bonvin, 2015).

We have implemented our contact—based method as a web ser—
ver, PRODIGY (PROtein binDIng enerGY prediction), a user—
friendly online tool for the prediction of binding affinity in protein—
protein complexes.

2 The web server

The PRODIGY server requires as input the 3D structure of a pro—
tein—protein complex, which can be provided in three different
manners:

' upload of the 3D structure in PDB or mmCIF format;

' automatic download from the protein databank;

' upload as an archive ﬁle (.tar, .tgz, .zip, .bz2, .tar.gz) for analyz—
ing multiple structures at the same time (with a limit of 50 MB).

The user is required to specify the chain identifiers for the molecules
involved in the interaction. It is also possible to specify the tempera—
ture, at which once can calculate the dissociation constant (25 °C by
default) and an email address, where a link to the results page will be
sent. When an ensemble of models of a NMR—determined complex is
submitted as a single input PDB file, only the first model will be used
for the prediction. The results (downloadable for 2 weeks) include:

1. the predicted value of the binding free energy (AG) in kcal mol’l;
the predicted value of the dissociation constant (Kd) in M calcu—
lated from AG : RT ln(Kd) where R is the idea gas constant
(kcal KT1 mol’l), Tthe temperature (K).

3. the number and type of intermolecular contacts within the 5.5 
distance cutoff (for details see Vangone and Bonvin, 2015);

4. the percentages of charged and polar amino—acids on the non—
interacting surface;

5. a downloadable table (.txt) of all residues occurring at the inter—
face and a ready—to—run Pymol script (.pml) (www.pymol.org);

6. a compressed ﬁle with all the result ﬁles.

Information about the predictive model and the training dataset can
be found online in the ‘Method’ and ‘Dataset’ page of PRODIGY,
respectively, accessible through the main page. PRODIGY has been
written in Python and Perl. The solvent accessible surface area is cal—
culated with open—source tool freeSASA (Mitternacht, 2015) using
the default NACCESS (Hubbard and Thornton, 1993) parameters
for atomic radii. The server is fast, performing the prediction in few
seconds for the largest complex examined in the benchmark (1DE4).
An example output page of PRODIGY is shown in Figure 1.

In conclusion, the PRODIGY server should contribute to
speeding—up development of new predictive approaches and facilitate
its use within various fields of biology. PRODIGY is freely accessible
at http://milou.science.uu.nl/services/PRODIGY. A standalone ver—
sion to run locally is freely available from our GitHub repository
(see http://www.bonvinlab.org/software).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Animal models are widely used in biomedical research
for reasons ranging from practical to ethical. An important issue is
whether rodent models are predictive of human biology. This has
been addressed recently in the framework of a series of challenges
designed by the systems biology verification for Industrial
Methodology for Process Verification in Research (sbv IMPROVER)
initiative. In particular, one of the sub-challenges was devoted to the
prediction of protein phosphorylation responses in human bronchial
epithelial cells, exposed to a number of different chemical stimuli,
given the responses in rat bronchial epithelial cells. Participating
teams were asked to make inter-species predictions on the basis of
available training examples, comprising transcriptomics and phospho-
proteomics data.

Results: Here, the two best performing teams present their data-
driven approaches and computational methods. In addition, post
hoc analyses of the datasets and challenge results were performed
by the participants and challenge organizers. The challenge outcome
indicates that successful prediction of protein phosphorylation status
in human based on rat phosphorylation levels is feasible. However,
within the limitations of the computational tools used, the inclusion
of gene expression data does not improve the prediction quality.
The post hoc analysis of time-speciﬁc measurements sheds light on
the signaling pathways in both species.

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite their limitations, animal models play an essential role in
biomedical research, ranging from basic science to translational
medicine, as human testing is severely limited by practical and
ethical constraints. In the context of drug development, the use-
fulness of animal models obviously hinges on the extent to which
results can be translated to human biology.

As an example, we consider here the response of bron-
chial epithelial cells to external chemical stimuli in rat and
human. On one hand, organisms of common origin should
arguably share many of the basic physiological mechanisms. On
the other hand, different species may exhibit signiﬁcant
differences in the details of their cellular mechanisms such
as signaling pathways. It is, therefore, essential to study this rela-
tionship systematically with the aim to develop reliable tools
for the translation of results from animal models to human
biology.

Recently, the systems biology verification Industrial Methodology
for Process Verification in Research (stIMPROVER) initiative
designed and organized the second sbv IMPROVER challenge,
which was devoted to the question of species translation. In par-
ticular, sub-challenge 2 discussed in the following, concerned
the protein phosphorylation status of normal human bronchial
epithelial cells (NHBE) and normal rat bronchial epithelial cells
(NRBE) exposed to the same set of chemical stimuli.

Herein, we present and discuss our studies of computational
approaches for the prediction of stimulus-specific human protein
phosphorylation levels based on gene expression and phosphor-
ylation observed in the rat model. In section 2, we first give a
brief description of the data and challenge design. Next, the
computational approaches to the prediction task are described.
After specifying the evaluation criteria applied by the challenge
organizers, we describe methods used for the post hoc analysis of
datasets and challenge results. Section 3 presents the results in
terms of the predictions and their evaluation. In addition, re-
sults of the post hoc analysis concerning modiﬁcations of the
prediction models and findings related to the phosphorylation
kinetics are presented. We conclude with a discussion of the
main results and an outlook on potential extensions and future
studies.

2 METHODS

Where applicable, the following is structured according to contributions
from the challenge organizers and the two best performing teams: team
AMG (Adel, Michael, Gyan) with members Bhanot, Biehl, Dayarian and
Hormoz and team IGB (Institute for Genomics and Bioinfonnatics) with
members Sadowski and Zeller.

2.1 Data acquisition and challenge design

The acquisition and preparation of the datasets are presented in greater
detail in thissorrakrai et al. (2015), which also provides further refer-
ences. A detailed description is also available at www.sbvimprover.com.
Here we give only a brief summary.

For subset (A) of chemical stimuli, gene expression and protein phos-
phorylation data in both species were made available to the challenge
participants. Predictions of the protein phosphorylation status in human
cells were to be made during the challenge for dataset (B), which corres-
ponded to a different set of stimuli and comprised only the gene expres-
sion and phosphorylation data for rat.

Figure 1 illustrates the challenge setup and structure of the datasets.
Each panel of data labeled as ‘P’ corresponds to the phosphorylation
levels of 16 different proteins under 26 chemical stimuli in dataset (A)
and 26 different stimuli in dataset (B). Phosphorylation measurements,
using the Luminex xMap (TM) platform, were performed at 5 and 25 min
after exposure to the stimuli. Repeated measurements provided two or
three replicates per stimulus and protein. In addition, five or six DME
(Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium) control measurements in absence
of any stimulus were provided.

In the following, the 16 proteins are referred to by numbers: AKTl (1),
MP2K1 (2), CREBl (3), MK03 (4), MK09 (5), MP2K6 (6), KS6B1 (7),
MK14K11 (8), PTN11 (9), WNKl (10), FAKl (11), HSPB1 (12), KS6A1
(13), GSK3B (14), IKBA (15) and TF65 (16). For the full list of 26 stimuli
in dataset (A) and 26 stimuli in dataset (B), see Rhn'ssorrakrai et al.
(2015) or consult www.sbvimprover.com.

Gene expression was measured 6h after exposure to the stimuli,
yielding GCRMA normalized Affymetrix (TM) microarray data in two
or three replicates. In addition, four or ﬁve replicates of DME controls
were available. All measurements corresponded to 13 841 genes for rat
and 20110 genes for human, respectively.

The two best performing teams (AMG and IGB) submitted purely
data-driven predictions based on the available phosphorylation data
only. The speciﬁc approaches used by the two teams and the evaluation
of submitted predictions are outlined in the following subsections.

It was disclosed to the challenge participants that a protein should
be considered activated if its phosphorylation level, compared with
DME controls, was greater than a threshold value of 3 in absolute
value. The available training data displayed a strong prevalence of in-
active proteins: considering the median over replicates, the resulting panel
of 416 = 16 x 26 rat phosphorylation levels in dataset A contained 61
(14.7%) values above threshold and 48 (11.5%) in dataset B. The avail-
able human data in set A contained 35 (8.4%) positive samples.

2.2 Team AMG: naive and Learning Vector
Quantization-based prediction

2.2.1 Processing of phosphorylation data The noise level observed
over replicates in the phosphorylation data appeared to be roughly con-
stant and of order 0(1), independent of the mean phosphorylation level.
To address the issue of outliers, we decided to use the median of the three
replicate values. This effectively removed outliers because at least two of
the three replicates were close together in value for all measurements.
After exposure to the stimuli, activation might have occurred before
5min, between 5 and 25 min or later. As there is no objective method
to decide which of these options is correct, we chose to combine the data

 

Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of the sub-challenge structure and datasets.
The objective was to predict the phosphorylation status (P) of human
phosphoproteins to stimuli subset B, shown in red, given the gene expres-
sion (GEx) and phosphorylation data for rat under the same stimuli.
Available data (blue) also comprised the measurements of phosphoryl-
ation and gene expression in rat and human under a different set of
stimuli A, which served as the training data. Human GEx data under
the set of stimuli B was unavailable (shown in gray)

from both time points, using only the larger phosphorylation level (in
absolute value and compared with controls) for each protein—stimulus
pair. Finally, the mean level of phosphorylation across all available con-
trol data was subtracted. In the following, ratP and humP denote phos-
phorylation levels after these simple preprocessing steps.

2.2.2 Prediction methods We applied two different methods to pre-
dict human protein activation in dataset B: a baseline prediction was
obtained by simply assuming equal activation in both species, i.e. by
setting ‘human=rat’ after appropriate thresholding. In a second ap-
proach, we used a linear classiﬁer trained on rat and human phosphor-
ylation data in set A. Eventually, both results were combined, taking into
account their prediction performance as assessed within dataset A.

2.2.3 Naive prediction A ﬁrst prediction was based on the simple
hypothesis that human phosphorylation levels (humP) and rat phosphor-
ylation (ratP) should be similar under the same stimuli. Taking into ac-
count a threshold of 3.0 in absolute value for protein activation, we
obtained heuristic certainty values by means of a non-linear monotonic
transformation of the form

c,,,,,=%[1+tanh(W)] 6 [0,1] (1)

The corresponding crisp classiﬁcation can be achieved by thresholding
at cmive = 0.5, i.e. IratPl = 3.

depend only on the ranking of certainties and are insensitive to the precise
choice of the monotonic non-linear function. Here, the arbitrary scaling
factor 5 in the argument of tanh was chosen to yield a reasonable spread
of values cnaive in the interval [0,1]. Measures that consider the accuracy of
crisp classiﬁcation depend on the choice of a threshold. Tuning the
threshold could have, for instance, the aim to achieve a number of posi-
tive predictions that matches the occurrence of positive human samples in
the training data. We did not tune or adapt the certainty threshold for
crisp classiﬁcation explicitly.

2.2.4 Learning Vector Quantization As an alternative to the naive
prediction, we applied a simple version of Learning Vector Quantization
(LVQ), speciﬁcally the so-called LVQl scheme (Biehl et al. 2007;
Kohonen 1990, 1997). To this end, the training dataset (A) was inter-
preted as to provide 26 feature vectors )5“ 6 R16, which comprise the
known rat phosphorylation levels ratP under stimuli a: 1, 2, . . .,26.
We considered 16 classiﬁcation problems separately, corresponding to
the protein-speciﬁc phosphorylation levels in human. Binary target
labels 0 or 1 were deﬁned according to the comparison of |humP| with
the threshold value of 3.0.

We used the simplest possible LVQ system, using only one prototype
per class, i.e. £50 and W1, which were adapted iteratively under random
sequential presentation of example data. For a given labeled feature
vector )5, the prototype W,- with the smallest Euclidean distance from 35
was updated according to the standard LVQl prescription [Biehl et al.
(2007); Kohonen (1990)]

Wt <— Wi‘l' "WU—5i, XX)? — Wi)‘ (2)

Here ‘I’(v‘5,—, 55): +1 if 55 belonged to class i and ‘I’(v‘5,—, 55): — 1 other-
wise. Prototypes were initialized in the class conditional means of the
actual training set. Updates (2) were performed at constant learning
rate (77:0.005) over 1000 single example presentations. The procedure
yielded two prototypes v50, v51 6 R16, which represent inactive or acti-
vated proteins, respectively. A crisp Nearest Prototype LVQ classiﬁer
assigns a feature vector 55 to class 1 (activation) if

d071, 55) S dU—foﬂf)

and to class 0 (inactive) otherwise. Here, the squared Euclidean measure
do}, 55)=(v_5 — 55)2 was used to quantify the distance of feature vectors
and prototypes; hence, the simple system with one prototype per class
parameterizes a linear class boundary (Biehl et al., 2007). It is important
to note that a separate LVQ classiﬁer was obtained for each of the 16
target proteins.

While probabilistic and fuzzy variants of LVQ have been suggested
in the literature, see e.g. [Schneider et al. (2010); See et al. (2003)], we
resorted here to the heuristic computation of a certainty similar to (1):

1 d(v?o.)?)—d(v?1.i)
mg: E[1+tanh(T e [0,1].

Crisp classiﬁcation is obtained by thresholding at cLVQ = 0.5. Again, the
scaling factor was set manually to achieve a variation of certainties similar
to the naive prediction. Whenever a particular training set contained
negative examples only, an LVQ system could not be determined and
the naive prediction was used, instead.

Estimates of the expected classiﬁcation performance were obtained
using a standard Leave-One-Out (L-O-O) validation procedure (Duda
et al., 2001; Hastie et al., 2009). The 26 slightly different LVQ classiﬁers
per protein were applied to dataset (B), inserting the corresponding
ratP values as feature vectors and obtaining predictions analogous to
Equation (3). The final LVQ predictions cLyQ 6 [0,1] were computed
as averages over the 26 L-O-O results.

2.2.5 Validation and combination of predictions We evaluated the
naive prediction by directly comparing the certainties cnaive obtained
from ratP in dataset A with the corresponding phosphorylation levels

humP. To this end, the latter were binarized by thresholding at
|humP|=3. As one of the many possible criteria, we considered the
ROC (Fawcett, 2006) over the full panel of 16 > 26: 416 values, which
yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of AUROCnm-VL. % 0.83.
This value reﬂects a relatively high predictive power of ratP for the ob-
servation of protein activation, |humP| > 3, within dataset A.

For the LVQ classiﬁer, we computed the ROC within dataset A as
obtained from the 26 L-O-O runs (Fawcett, 2006). The corresponding
area under curve was found to be AUROCLVQ % 0.88, suggesting a
slightly better performance of LVQ as compared with the naive
prediction.

Eventually, the ﬁnal prediction in terms of certainties for |humP| > 3.0
in the test dataset B was obtained as the weighted combination

c.....(AUR0C...-V. — 0.5) + ctVQ(AUR0CtyQ — 05)
AUROCmmL. -I- AUROCLVQ — 1

 

CAMG = - (4)
The speciﬁc form reﬂects the fact that AUROC = 0.5 corresponds to the
baseline for random guesses. For the prediction submitted to the chal-
lenge, we had computed protein-speciﬁc combinations. However, the cor-
responding prediction and its test set performance were virtually identical
with the results reported here. An unweighted mean of the two predic-
tions would have given similar results, because of the relatively small
difference of the AUROC.

As post hoc analysis, we also tested our results using the criteria that
were ultimately used by the challenge organizers (see Section 2.4). For the
training set (A) performance, we found the values summarized in Table 1.
These alternative criteria also suggest a comparable or slightly superior
quality of the LVQ system compared with the naive prediction.

2.3 Team IGB: neural network-based prediction

Team IGB’s pipeline consisted of two parts: an artiﬁcial neural network
(NN) trained to predict human phosphorylation status from rat data, and
a statistical analysis that aggregated evidence from the replicated
measurements.

Both phosphorylation and gene expression status was provided with the
rat data, so it was possible to use both in predicting the human phospho-
protein status. However, validation experiments indicated that the rat
gene expression data only increased overﬁtting during training, so these
features were removed. Thus, the submitted predictions used a NN with 32
inputs, corresponding to the 16 protein phosphorylation levels measured
at both 5 and 25 min, a single hidden layer of 1000 logistic units and 32
logistic outputs with a cross entropy loss function. The training data
comprised every possible inputetarget pair for each stimulus; a stimulus
with three rat measurements and three human measurements contributed
nine samples to the training set. As a preprocessing step, the log phos-
phorylation measurements were clipped to be between the values of 3 and
7, then translated and scaled to be in the range [0,1], allowing us to inter-
pret these values as the probability that a particular protein is phosphory-
lated. The same transformation was applied to the DME controls.

To avoid overﬁtting, the NN was trained with stochastic neurons. We
tested both the dropout learning algorithm (Baldi et al., 2013; Hinton
et al., 2012) and a variant in which Gaussian noise was added to each

neuron (Baldi et al. (2014)); i.e. at each forward propagation through the
network during training, a different random value e~N(0, 0.2) is added
to the output of each neuron independently. The additive Gaussian noise
algorithm was used to train the ﬁnal network because it performed
slightly better than the dropout algorithm on a validation set. The ﬁnal
network was trained for 6000 epochs with a learning rate that started at
0.1, and decayed exponentially by 1.000004 after each batch. The mo-
mentum term increased linearly from 0.5 to 0.99 over the ﬁrst 500 epochs,
then remained constant. The weights were initialized randomly from
U(—0.01,0.01) for the ﬁrst layer and U(—0.001, 0.001) for the second
layer. All NN training was performed using the Pylearn2 and Theano
software libraries (Bergstra et al., 2010; Goodfellow et al., 2013).

At prediction time, the NN was used to make predictions from each in-
dividual replicate. To combine these predictions, and to use the statistical
properties of the background distribution, we performed an additional
statistical analysis step to test for a signiﬁcant difference in the predicted
phosphorylation of the proteins compared with the DME controls. For
each of the 32 predictions, we perform a one-tailed two-sample t-test for
equal means against the DME controls. To make a ﬁnal prediction in the
range [0,1], we compute log10(—log10(P—value) -I- 1).

2.4 Evaluation of predictions

The choice of evaluation criteria had to take the pronounced prevalence
of inactive prosphoproteins into account, to avoid artifacts. For instance,
all-negative predictions would appear competitive with non-trivial
schemes when taking only overall accuracies into account.

The precise assessment criteria were not disclosed beforehand. This
prevented participants from ﬁne-tuning their results according to the ex-
pected evaluation process. For a more complete discussion of the evalu-
ation criteria, see also (thissorrakrai et al., 2015). Participants submitted
their predictions in terms of certainty scores ranging from 0 (certainly not
activated) to I (certainly activated). These predictions were evaluated by
comparison with a binarized gold standard, where 1 or 0 indicated that the
phosphorylation level (median over replicates) was above or below a
threshold of 3 in absolute value, respectively. This choice corresponds
to :I:3 SDs calculated across all phosphorylation values including DME
controls. Details of the preprocessing and deﬁnition of the gold standard
are also given in thissorrakrai et al. (2015).

The organizers decided to consider a combination of three different
quality measures:

a AUPR: The area under the Precision Recall curve (AUPR) is ac-
cepted as an appropriate measure for biased classiﬁcation problems
(Davis and Goadrich, 2006). It was obtained for the panel of 416
predictions and yielded a quantity between 0 and 1.

o PCC: The Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (PCC) was based on the
correlation corr of certainties with the binarized gold standard and
was evaluated over the full panel of prediction and then scaled to
obtain values in [0,1]:

PCC=(1 +corr)/2.

a BAC: The Balanced Accuracy (BAC) takes into account the number
of true-positive (TP) and true-negative (TN) predictions separately
(Brodersen et al., 2010):

BAC=(TP/P+ TN/N)/2

with 0 5 BAC 5 1, where T and N are the total number of positive
and negative samples, respectively. Team predictions were thresh-
olded at c = 0.5 for this measure.

Team submissions were assessed and ranked according to the sum
AUPR -I- PCC -I- BAC. In addition, tests for the statistical signiﬁcance
of differences between team performances were performed. The AUPR
depends only on the order of the certainties c e [0, 1], whereas for the

The values were chosen to enhance the differences in timecourse phosphorylation
between rat and human.

BAC, only the comparison with the threshold 0.5 matters. However, the
Pearson correlation may depend signiﬁcantly on the precise values of the
certainties, as for instance controlled by the non-linearities in the predic-
tions (1) and (3).

2.5 Post hoc analyses

The release of the gold standard after completion of the challenge made
possible further investigations. The performance measures used in the
challenge ranking were also applied to the individual predictions of
team AMG, i.e. the naive and LVQ classiﬁers. Similarly, predictions
based on single time point measures (at 5 and 25 min, respectively)
were evaluated separately along the same lines. In addition to the chal-
lenge criteria, AUROC were determined analogously.

Several modifications of the classiﬁcation scheme were considered by
team IGB, including attempts to make use of the gene expression data as
additional input features to the NN classiﬁer.

The time point-speciﬁc data were also exploited in an analysis provided
by the challenge organizers. All pairs formed of the 52 stimuli and 16
proteins can be labeled according to Table 2, which compares the timing
of activation in human and rat according to the measurements at 5min
(early) and 25 min (late). After assigning labels as speciﬁed in Table 2, a
hierarchically clustered heatmap of proteins and stimuli was generated
using the routine pheatmap in the R package (distance: ‘Euclidean’,
clustering method: ‘average’).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Test set predictions and evaluation

Figure 2 displays the naive, the LVQ based and the combined
prediction of team AMG, as well as team IGB’s prediction as
color-coded certainties for dataset B.

The performance of the final prediction with respect to the test
set data was evaluated by the challenge organizers in terms of the
three different quality measures presented above. After disclos-
ure of the sub-challenge outcome and the gold standard, we also
assessed the corresponding performance of the individual predic-
tions cnaive and CLVQ, Separately, in terms of the measures
AUROC, AUPR, PCC and BAC. The outcome is summarized
in Table 3 and shows that the naive prediction showed the best
performance among all individual methods; it was only outper-
formed by the weighted combination c A Mg.

3.2 Further post-challenge analysis

After completion of the challenge and disclosure of the gold
standard, additional aspects of the data could be investigated in
a post hoc analysis as summarized in the following.

3.2.] Team IGB: inﬂuence of model details on
performance Various choices existed at each stage of IGB’s
prediction pipeline, and ultimately only a single model was
chosen for final submission. Table 4 shows various combinations
of these choices and their inﬂuence on the ﬁnal performance
evaluation on the gold standard. Rough predictions for human
phosphorylation were made using (i) a NN trained on phos-
phorylation data alone (P); (ii) a NN trained on phosphorylation
and gene expression data (P-I- GE) or (iii) by using the rat phos-
phorylation as a prediction for that of human directly. Next, the
NN outputs were transformed using the logistic function to
spread the data away from a ﬁxed value 0.5, the max predicted
value for DME in the training data (max DME) or not at all.
Last, we varied the method of aggregating the NN output on the
replicates, using either a t-test (standard or Bayesian) or a simple
mean over replicates.

Results suggest that performing t-tests increased performance
on the BAC performance metric, but in fact lowered perform-
ance on the other metrics. The overall performance of IGB’s
ﬁnal submission could have been improved by eliminating the
standard t-test in favor of averaging the raw NN output, but not

done for the subchallenge scoring.

enough to rank above the top-scoring submission from Team
AMG, which had a sum of 2.06 versus a sum of 1.93 using the
original Team IGB submission without a t-test. Additionally, the
original model used by Team IGB could have been improved if
the aggregation of time points was performed using the mean
rather than the max over both time points, as the sum of the
three scoring methods increased for predictions using the human
(P) and for rat (rat P), while BAC decreases, when a standard
t-test was performed. If the standard t-test is eliminated, the
original choice of taking the max over both time points per-
formed best. Further, a marginal gain of 0.0002 could have
been obtained in the ﬁnal summation of scores by transforming
the NN output using the logistic function centered on 0.5, but
this gain is not consistent with the choice of training data used in
the NN (P, P+ GE or Rat P).

3.2.] Team AMG: time-specific naive predictions In addition to
the naive prediction described in Section 2.2, we considered
ratP-based certainties cm and cm) as obtained following the

same naive scheme, of. Equation (1), but from the measurements
at 5 and 25 min separately. The total cnaive discussed above could
be recovered as cnaive =max {c(5), 625)} from these time-resolved
predictions. All results presented in this subsection correspond to
the test set data (B).

The naive certainties yield 31 positive predictions with
cm 2 0.5, 34 cases with c(25) 3 0.5 and 48 positive predictions
in total (cnaive 3 0.5). In comparison, the number of human pro-
tein activations in the target data is 21 at 5min, 20 at 25 min and
31 in total. Hence, the naive predictions tend to overestimate the
number of active proteins in the test set.

We compared the individual predictions with the thresholded
humP(5) and humP(25) values at 5 and 25 min, respectively. In
addition, we considered cm and cm) as separate predictions
for the binarized gold standard, which corresponds to threshold-
ing |humP| = max {|humP(5)|, |humP(25)|}. For the time point-spe-
ciﬁc predictions analogous to Equation (1), we obtained the test
set performances summarized in Table 5. The results show that
the agreement between ratP and humP appears to be slightly
stronger for the measurements at 25 min. Moreover, the naive
cas) yields a test set performance similar to that of the total cnaive
already, of. Table 3.

3.2.2 Other challenge results and meta-analysis The challenge
organizers analyzed and compared predictions provided by
13 different teams. A detailed discussion is presented in
thissorrakrai et al. (2015). Arguably the most remarkable ﬁnd-
ings were the following:

Among the 13 participating teams, 8 based their predictions on
phosphorylation data only. This turned out advantageous, as also
ﬁve of the six top-ranked submissions did not use the GEx data.

All submitted predictions were based on data-driven
approaches, applying a variety of computational methods includ-
ing NNs, linear discriminant analysis and support vector ma-
chines. A universally superior approach or family of algorithms
could not be identiﬁed with respect to the achieved rankings.

Ten teams submitted predictions that were signiﬁcantly bet-
ter than random concerning at least two of the three applied
performance measures. However, most predictions failed to out-
perform the naive approach of equating human with rat phos-
phorylation. This simple baseline strategy would have achieved
rank 2 in the sub-challenge.

Averaging all team predictions, exploiting the potential
wisdom of the crowd, did not outperform the top-ranked teams,
but scored better than the second best performer with respect to
AUPR and PCC.

3.2.3 Phosphorylation kinetics in rat and human To detect phos-
phorylation patterns that differ in timing and activity in rat and
human, the challenge organizers looked for changes in phosphor-
ylation at the two different time points, 5min and 25 min, after
the cells’ exposure to a stimulus and computed the state of phos-
phorylation of the 16 measured proteins for each of the 52 sti-
muli (training and test sets) at both time points. Figure 3 shows
that, overall, stimuli cause more activation in rat than in human
cells except for two speciﬁc phosphoproteins KS6A1 and
HSPBl. Differences between the kinetics of activation at time
points 5 and 25 min are minimal. This difference could be
owing to a more homogeneous biological sample in rats than

in humans, or simply to higher sensitivity and faster signaling
of the NRBE cells compared with NHBE cells.

To test whether signaling pathways are used similarly in rat
and human, we describe in Figure 3B and C, two pathways taken
from literature and whose components are present in our dataset.
AKTl is known to activate KS6B1/p70-S6 kinase, an mTOR
activation marker shown to phosphorylate and activate
CREBl 0(ing et al., 1996) but KS6B1/p70—S6 is destabilized
by TNFut signaling through IKBA and TF65/RelA (Gao et al.,
2009). Conversely, AKTl has been shown to phosphorylate and
negatively regulate GSK3 ﬂ (Cantley 2002) and positively regu-
late WNKl (Jiang et al., 2005). EGF activates AKTl (Cantley
2002) and PTNl 1, the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor
type 11 also known as PTP2C (Schulze et al., 2005).

In Figure 3B, we note that, besides the overall larger number
of phosphorylated proteins in rat compared with human, from
the four stimuli, i.e. EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor), TGFA
(Transforming Growth Factor alpha), EPGC (Epigallocatechin),
and PMA (Phorbol-l2-Myristate—13-Acetate), that activate
CREBl through KS6B1 in rat, only EGF does so in human.
Also all the stimuli that activate CREBl independently of
KS6B1 in rat do not do so in human, showing a large divergence
in signaling. We observe that TNFut signaling through IKBA
and TF65/RelA occurs as expected in both human and rat, as
KS6B1 is not active in presence of TNFut probably being
degraded through the phosphorylated IKBA. Interestingly, dif-
ferences arise with ILlB and EPGC that also activate IKBA in
human, but in rat, EPGC does not activate IKBA and KS6B1 is
active. Conversely, PMA activates IKBA only in human, but in
both species, KS6B1 is active.

In Figure 3C, AKTl activation of WNKl is conserved as from
the four stimuli (EGF, TGFA, EPGC, INS) activating WNKl in
human and rat, only EGF signaling is not similar in rat and
human cells. Once again more activity is shown in rat, as five
stimuli activate AKTl and inactivate GSK3ﬂ in rat but not in
human. As shown in the wiring diagram of Figure 3c, EGF turns
on AKTl and PTNll and AKTl activation represses GSK3.
However, contrary to this, for ﬁve stimuli in rat and four in
human, GSK3 is active even though its repressor AKTl is also
active. PTNll activation is concordant in human and rat only
for 2 of 13 stimuli (NACL and EPGC). Overall, EGF seems to
activate AKTl in rat but PTNll in human and GSK3 seems
active in both organisms. The EGF activation diagram is
respected for human (i.e. when AKTl is inactive, GSK3 is

rat are similar.

4 DISCUSSION

With respect to the predictions required in the sub-challenge,
results summarized in Table 3 indicate that the naive prediction
was already competitive and yielded the best prediction perform-
ance of all individual methods. On the other hand, the ﬁndings
demonstrate that the combination of different methods had the
effect of improving the test set performance with respect to some
of the criteria. In the comparison across the primary methods
shown in Table 4, the ranking of the different choices also
confirms that assuming humP B ratP yields a decent baseline
performance as compared with the NN trained on just phosphor-
ylation data.

It is also interesting to note that team AMG’s naive prediction
outperformed the LVQ method with respect to the test set B,
while LVQ appeared superior in the training set validation.
Apparently, the relatively small sample sizes do not allow for
more reliable performance estimates by means of the L-O—O
method.

The organizers of the challenge compared all the submissions,
and the details of this analysis are described in thissorrakrai
et al. (2015). Like most participants of the sub-challenge, the two
top-ranked teams chose to predict protein activation in human
exclusively from the rat phosphorylation data. The immediate
reaction of the cell in terms of protein phosphorylation can be
expected to be similar. However, species-speciﬁc details in the
regulation processes may be signiﬁcant along the complex path-
ways from phosphorylation to gene expression levels. The use of
gene expression data is further complicated by high dimension
compared with the relatively small number of samples. Both
teams decided to avoid this complexity, which, combined with
measurement noise and unknown thresholds for gene activation,
may contribute to significant prediction errors.

One possible strategy for the inclusion of gene expression data
in the analysis would require several steps: from rat phosphoryl-
ation levels to rat gene expression data to human gene expres-
sion to human phosphorylation levels, with the possibility of
signiﬁcant and unknown systematic and stochastic errors.
Alternatively, as explored by team IGB, rat GEx data could be
used as additional input to the prediction model directly. Results
summarized in Table 4 show that, interestingly, a NN trained on
P in combination with gene expression (GEx) performs worse
than using rat P as a naive prediction for human P. This is not
unexpected, primarily because of overﬁtting on the numerous
GEx features using only a handful of training examples.
Additionally, no cross-validation methods were used by Team
IGB to speciﬁcally avoid overfitting, and therefore the trained
model performs well on the training data but not on the test
data, for which it performs about as poorly as random and
ranks among the worst performing submissions.

The post hoc evaluation of time-speciﬁc rat phosphorylation
values as naive predictors for human protein activation at the
corresponding time points, of. Table 5, reveals that the agreement
is slightly better for the measurement at 25 min. This could
simply reﬂect a more pronounced variability in the early stages

of protein activation, or that most of the activation happens
between 5 and 25 min.

It is difﬁcult to come to a general conclusion concerning the
comparison of signaling pathways and their kinetics in rat
and human. Closer inspection of the phosphorylation kinetics
revealed significant differences between rat and human with re-
spect to the activation patterns, but pathways that are activated
similarly in the two species could also be identiﬁed.

The differences in regulation of signaling pathways in these
species seem to be stimulus and pathway-dependent, but can
be identiﬁed from a well-structured training set as shown by
the challenge results.

5 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

A detailed comparison and analysis of predictions submitted
by 13 different teams is provided in thissorrakrai et al.
(2015). In general, the challenge results indicate that the
stimulus-dependent protein phosphorylation displays significant
correlation between rat and human, which facilitates direct inter-
species prediction. Indeed, the analyses provided by the best per-
forming teams were purely data driven and based on the rat
phosphorylation status only.

In forthcoming projects, more sophisticated classiﬁers and
training schemes should be exploited for the prediction. As just
one example, the application of more advanced variants of LVQ
using adaptive distance measures appears promising (Bunte
et al., 2012; Schneider et al., 2009).

Improved training schemes and careful control of overﬁtting
effects may allow for the beneﬁcial inclusion of gene expression.
Similarly, low-dimensional representations of the GEx data or
the consideration of ortholog gene sets could be used. The latter
strategies have proven useful in the related sub-challenges con-
cerning intra-species predictions of phosphorylation (Dayarian
et al., 2014) and inter-species prediction of gene set activation
(Hormoz et al., 2014), respectively.

In all approaches presented here, target proteins were con-
sidered independently. Correlations or anti-correlations between
different phosphoproteins as observed in the training set could
prove useful in more sophisticated prediction techniques.

Going beyond a purely data-driven analysis and prediction by
taking into account available domain knowledge should provide
further insights into the mechanisms that control the activation
kinetics and help us better understand the differences and simi-
larities between the two species.

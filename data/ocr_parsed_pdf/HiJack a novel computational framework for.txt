Abstract

Motivation: Pathogens infect their host and hijack the host machinery to produce more progeny
pathogens. Obligate intracellular pathogens, in particular, require resources of the host to replicate.
Therefore, infections by these pathogens lead to alterations in the metabolism of the host, shifting
in favor of pathogen protein production. Some computational identification of mechanisms
of host—pathogen interactions have been proposed, but it seems the problem has yet to be
approached from the metabolite—hijacking angle.

Results: We propose a novel computational framework, Hi—Jack, for inferring pathway—based inter—
actions between a host and a pathogen that relies on the idea of metabolite hijacking. Hi—Jack
searches metabolic network data from hosts and pathogens, and identifies candidate reactions
where hijacking occurs. A novel scoring function ranks candidate hijacked reactions and identifies
pathways in the host that interact with pathways in the pathogen, as well as the associated fre—
quent hijacked metabolites. We also describe host—pathogen interaction principles that can be
used in the future for subsequent studies. Our case study on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
revealed pathways in human—e.g. carbohydrate metabolism, lipids metabolism and pathways
related to amino acids metabolism—that are likely to be hijacked by the pathogen. In addition, we
report interesting potential pathway interconnections between human and Mtb such as linkage of
human fatty acid biosynthesis with Mtb biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, or linkage of
human pentose phosphate pathway with lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in Mtb.

1 Introduction

Metabolism is an aggregation of chemical reactions utilized by cellu—
lar processes to generate vital metabolites for survival and growth.
Metabolic networks are organized in pathways where reactions are
connected to each other, meaning that substrates (input molecules)
catalyzed by enzymes are transformed to products (output mol—
ecules; Croes et (11., 2006). These networks are represented as
graphs. The available information consists of metabolites, enzymes,
genes and relevant annotations, usually coming from experiments in
model organisms (e.g. E. coli) and archived in repositories such as
KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000), EcoCyc/MetaCyc (Karp et (11.,
2000) and aMaze (Lemer et (11., 2004).

Data that harbours the relevant information enables the develop—
ment of computational methods that identify interconnections
between cellular processes, with a focus on metabolic pathway infer—
ence. One stream of methods targets synthetic biology and pathway
reconstruction. Algorithms such as CMPF (Lim and Wong, 2012),
MRSD (Xia et (11., 2011), Metabolic PathFinding (Croes et (11.,
2005) and the FMM web—server (Chou et (11., 2009) take as input
pairs of source and target metabolites, and search for routes in the
metabolic network that satisfy specific constraints such as shortest
distance between source and target or, minimal switching from one
pathway to another. Another stream of methods targets inference of
complex regulatory modules given sets of gene expression profiles
(Chueh and Lu, 2012; Ourfali et (11., 2007).

The aforementioned methods opened new routes for investigat—
ing interactions between metabolic processes, simplifying functional
mechanisms and deciphering relationships between genes, chemical
reactions and metabolites using data from a single organism.
However, studying the interplay between two different organisms
that interact (host and pathogen) and inferring relationships
between them is a more challenging problem. In addition,
host—pathogen interactions are important for understanding infec—
tion mechanisms and developing better prevention and treatment
strategies of infectious diseases. However, up to this point, state—of—
the—art computational methods for studying host—pathogen inter—
actions have aimed primarily at identifying host—pathogen
protein—protein interactions (PPIs; Zhou et (11., 2013), rather than at
the metabolic—pathway level.

Pathogens have the ability to survive and populate inside a
host under extremely hostile conditions by invading the host’s im—
mune—response system (Pieters and Gatfield, 2002; Singh et (11.,
2013). It is also well established that pathogens, upon infection,
hijack some of the host’s functional processes to produce nutrients
required for survival (Niederweis, 2008). Thus, inferring path—
ways in the pathogen that are likely to interact with pathways in the
host, based on the idea of hijacking metabolites or nutrients, is
a novel and promising direction for studying host—pathogen
interactions.

We propose Hi—Jack, a novel computational framework for
inferring metabolic pathway interactions between hosts and patho—
gens based on the idea of metabolite hijacking. Hi—Jack searches for
chemical reactions required for a pathogen’s growth that satisfy cer—
tain metabolitdnutrient—acquisition criteria. Input to the algorithm
is the metabolic network of a host organism and the metabolic net—
work of a pathogen. Both metabolic networks are represented as dir—
ected graphs, and graph—theoretic metrics as well as graph statistics
are collected to rank pathways according to their significance in hi—
jacking interactions. The same ranking schema is used to identify
chemical compounds that are candidate targets of hijacking by the
pathogen, as well as chemical reactions of great interest, accompa—
nied by their corresponding pathway details.

As a proof of concept, we studied Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb), and we applied Hi—Jack to identify important metabolic path—
way interactions with human. We focused on Mtb since it is an
‘ancient’ intracellular bacterium (meaning that tuberculosis is an old
disease in terms of historical documentation) responsible for ~2.5
million deaths per year (Russell, 2001). Mtb is also known for its
ability to manipulate phagosome to resist destruction by macro—
phages. It is a pathogen extremely resistant to drugs, and develop—
ment of anti—tuberculosis drugs remains an important health
problem worldwide. Hi—Jack analysis revealed that in human, path—
ways related to amino—acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism
and metabolism of lipids are more likely to be hijacked by Mtb.
Strong examples are fatty acid biosynthesis, pentose phosphate path—
way, purine metabolism and arginine and proline metabolism. On
the Mtb side, fatty acid biosynthesis, purine metabolism and biosyn—
thesis of unsaturated fatty acids are ranked higher in our list of path—
ways. Moreover, we found chemical compounds that are frequent
targets of hijacked chemical reactions in human. Hijacking of carbo—
hydrates and lipids is in agreement with evidence coming from the
literature, which indicates that Mtb under very hostile conditions in
the host, switches to lipids as an alternative source of energy
(Niederweis, 2008). The analysis also revealed that Mtb often hi—
jacks compounds from human to produce metabolites linked to cell—
wall construction.

The evidence for the Hi—Jack predictions mentioned above in—
clude the following principles: (i) proportion of pathways that con—
tain c0mputationally—predicted host—pathogen PPIs; (ii) proportion
of pathways that contain genes required for bacterium optimal
growth; (iii) tissue specificity of the hijacked pathways in the host
and (iv) linkage of the predicted pathways with known drug targets.
Our validation principles and some findings coming from literature
confirmed the initial hypothesis and indicate that Hi—Jack has the
potential to infer pathway—based host—pathogen interactions and
identify metabolites likely to be hijacked by the pathogens. To our
knowledge, this is the first study that utilizes metabolic pathway
data from both host and pathogen metabolisms and ranks candidate
interconnections at the pathway level based on their global signifi—
cance in the phenomenon of hijacking vital metabolites. Also, the
proposed validation principles have high potentials to be applied in
future studies on host—pathogen interactions.

2 Methods

2.1 Metabolic network data

Although metabolic network data are available from many different
sources (e.g. Rhea, BiGG, UniPathway, BioPath, BRENDA, SEED
and Reactome), KEGG and MetaCyc are the largest curated data—
bases of metabolic reactions and pathways containing significantly
more reactions than all the other sources and having about the same
level of chemical reactions in their pathways (Altman et (11., 2013).
Hi—Jack was designed to work with metabolic—network data and an—
notations downloaded from KEGG database (Kanehisa and Goto
2000) using the KEGG API. We retrieved the list of human (hsa)
metabolic pathways that contains 287 pathways. Similarly, we
downloaded the list of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtu) pathways
that contains 115 distinct pathways.

We retrieved KEGG chemical reactions that are mapped to meta—
bolic pathways in the RPAIR format (Reactant Pairs). This data
format decomposes chemical reactions into a set of single substrate—
product pairs, together with the chemical structure transformation
patterns characterized by the atom type changes at the reactant

center (Hattori et al., 2003). A chemical reaction with multiple sub—
strates/products is represented in the RPAIR format by multiple react—
ant pairs, each pair in the form of X —> Y. As an example, chemical
reaction beta—D—glucose —> cellobiose +HzO is decomposed into two
RPAIRs: Beta—D—glucose —> cellobiose and beta—D—glucose —> HzO.
Those pairs that appear in KEGG metabolic pathway datasets are
called the main pairs. Hi—Jack takes into account the main pairs that
are involved in hijacked interactions between host and pathogen. In
practice, within our deployed datasets, data are represented as triplets
that contain pathway ids and pairs of compounds that interact in the
corresponding pathways. RPAIR annotation has been successfully
applied in several path—finding algorithms and metabolic—network—
analysis frameworks (Faust et al., 2009). Given the lists of RPAIR, we
identified 5658 reactions in human and 3942 reactions in Mtb. Note
that the raw human/Mtb datasets contain reversible reactions.
However, in the data pre—processing step we filtered out RPAIR re—
versed directions that are not specified in any metabolic pathway.

A metabolite is considered not produced in the host (resp., patho—
gen) if either of the following two conditions is met: (i) The metabolite
has no incoming edge in the host (resp., pathogen) metabolic pathway
graphs. Obviously, such a metabolite can be assumed not produced in
the host (resp., pathogen). (ii) The metabolite is in the beginning of a
host (resp., pathogen) metabolic pathway, serving as ‘starting point’
of the associated biological process, and it is not produced by other
host (resp., pathogen) pathways. Such a metabolite can start a cyclic
process (e.g. the Calvin cycle). Even though such a metabolite typic—
ally has an incoming edge from the end of the cycle, some initial
amount of it is needed to start the cycle. If it is not produced by any
other pathways in the host (resp., pathogen), it has to be imported.

2.2 Hi—Jack implementation

Hi—Jack deploys a simple filtering algorithm that searches host and
pathogen metabolic networks for RPAIRs that satisfy a metabolite—
hijacking hypothesis. The default hijacking hypothesis is defined as
follows: Suppose there is a reaction Clp—> C2P in a pathogen, a reac—
tion Clh—> C21, in its host and the pathogen cannot generate the
metabolite C11,; C1P is not a frequent cofactor, specific inorganic
molecules or basic energy carrier; then the pathogen will hijack reac—
tion Clh—> C21, in host, provided that C1P equals C21,. In simple
words, if the pathogen for various reasons—like hostile environ—
ment, host immune responses or drug effects—cannot create a sub—
strate that is required by a reaction to generate a needed metabolite,
it will obtain this substrate from its environment (host metabolism).
This is a reasonable hypothesis for the following reason. Assuming
C1P is not made in the pathogen and is not imported, the reaction
Clp—> C2P is thus not useful in the pathogen. There is hence no evo—
lutionary pressure to keep this reaction in the pathogen. It should
eventually get ‘optimized’ out of the genome of the pathogen (espe—
cially in an ancient pathogen). That is, this reaction should not be
present in the pathogen. Such an interconnected pair of reactions is
called a ‘hijacked reaction’, and the compound that links these reac—
tions is called ‘point of hijacking’ or ‘target of hijacking’.

In a refined further analysis, a stricter hypothesis can be postu—
lated that searches for reactions Clh—> C21, in the host and Clp—> C2P
in the pathogen satisfying the additional condition that the C2P com—
pound is not produced in the host. This scenario simulates cases
when the pathogen follows different underlying chemical processes
from the host by utilizing non—homologous enzymes to produce
essential metabolites for its own growth (e.g. Mtb has 55 enzymes
non—homologous to human; Amir et al., 2014).

A common problem when dealing with metabolic network
data in the RPAIR format is the effect of ‘currency compounds’

(e.g. HZO, ATP, NAD+, NADP+/NADPH, Oz, COZ). These com—
pounds, which are usually cofactors, small inorganic molecules or
energy carriers, take part in many chemical processes and, thus, are
characterized by much higher node degrees than other central me—
tabolites in the metabolic network. We have plotted the node degree
(viz. sum of in/out degree) of the compounds involved in our ana—
lysis in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2, illustrating the degree dis—
tribution of the compounds found in human and Mtb. The degree
distribution is a power—law distribution: only a few compounds have
very high degree. As a result, any path finding or filtering algorithm
similar to Hi—Jack, applied on such metabolic network data, will use
these highly connected compounds and thus many wrong or non—
sense paths may be inferred.

To mitigate this problem, when filtering hijacked reactions and
points of hijacking, Hi—Jack excludes paths involving 36 compounds
that are highly connected. This strategy does not affect the mass bal—
ance of reactions and does not destroy the equilibrium of the meta—
bolic pathways (Croes et al., 2006). To illustrate this in a simple
way, an example is provided in Figure 1. It becomes clear that with—
out eliminating HZO from the process, invalid connections are
inferred that result in non—sense chemical procedures similar to the
production of 5 —aminolevulinate from beta—D—glucose.

After applying the hijacking hypothesis and identifying the
points of hijacking, the algorithm returns a list of candidate inter—
connections. These candidate solutions are represented as RPAIRs
in the host and pathogen, as well as the corresponding pathways in
which these reactions occur. Note that one host pathway may have
several hijacked RPAIRs that interconnect to one or more RPAIRs
in the pathogen that belong to one or more pathways.

To rank the solutions, we used graph metrics and statistics col—
lected from the metabolic network. In the simplest case, node in—
and out—degrees are representative of the significance of each metab—
olite. Each hijacking match is scored using the formula:

[in deg(C,17) + 1] X [in deg(C%) + 1]
><[outdeg(C,37) + 1] X [outdeg(Cg) + 1]

[in deg(C,17) + 1] X [in deg(C%) + 1]
><[outdeg(C,37) + 1] X [outdeg(Cg) + 1]

HMS :

 

Since all reactions in the deployed host and pathogen datasets are
oriented and pathways are represented as directed graphs, in the
HijackingMatc/oingScore (HMS) formula above, indeg(X) denotes
the in—degree for the chemical compound X and outdeg(X) denotes
the out—degree for X in the pathway.

In HMS, greater scores are assigned to a target of hijacking
where the pathogen has fewer ways to produce it, the host has
more ways to produce it, the pathogen has more ways to use it, and/
or the host has fewer ways to use it. Variations of HMS utilize,
instead of node degree, Page Rank or other metrics like centrality to
weight compounds according to their significance in the ﬂow of me—
tabolites in the network; see the Supplementary Material and our
web—repository. HMS is computed for every pair of interconnected
reactions in host and pathogen using the hijacked metabolites. Then
for every pathway, these scores are aggregated generating a global
ranking score, PathwayRank, which reflects the likelihood of
the underline pathway to interact with pathways in the other

 

organism.

Next we provide a concrete example that shows how Hi—Jack works:
Let us assume pathway P1 in human contains 6 reactions as depicted
in Figure 2. For simplicity we have also pre—computed in— and out—
degrees for all of the compounds found in the pathway. Let us now
focus on reaction C2 —> C4 in P1. If we assume that for some reason
the pathogen cannot produce compound C4, then C4 becomes a
hijacking point for the pathogen. After searching in the pathogen’s
metabolism, we identify two reactions that require C4 to produce
their metabolites. Specifically, in Figure 2, reaction C4 —> C12 in the
pathogen’s pathway P4 and C4 —> C8 in the pathogen’s pathway P6
require substrate C4 to generate their products. In Figure 2, we have
also pre—computed in and out degrees for all the compounds on the
pathogen’s side. We get HMS(P1/P4): 1 and HMS(P1/P6):0.33.
These scores represent the local ‘strength’ of interconnections between
pathways P1/P4 and P1/P6. It follows that PathwayRank(P1) : 0.22,
since it has 1 hijacked reaction out of 6 reactions that P1 contains.

The idea behind PathwayRank is relatively simple, indicating
that longer pathways (in terms of number of reactions) with many
hijacked reactions are more likely to interact with pathogen path—
ways. Following the previous example, let us assume pathway P2 in
the host has exactly the same length 6 as pathway P1. Let us also as—
sume that these pathways achieve the same sum of HMS (1.33 in
our example) but P2 has 2 hijacked reactions instead of 1 in P1. The
PathwayRank of P1 is 0.22 and P2 is 0.44, meaning that pathway
P2—which has more targets for hijacking for a particular number of
reactions—is more likely to interact with the pathogen.

Once we rank the pathways for both human and Mtb, it is easy
to parse the results and identify interesting metabolites based on the
frequency of occurrences in hijacked interactions. Note that, since
HMS and PathwayRank are specific to host/pathogen data (e.g.
in—/out—degree of a chemical compound depends on the organism’s
metabolism), Hi—Jack is capable of reﬂecting specific metabolic
characteristics of different hosts and pathogens.

Fig. 2. How Hi-Jack works. In the upper part, we have pathway P1 in human
with 6 reactions. Given reaction CZHCA, we found in Mtb pathways two
points of hijacking for compound C4 that are presented in the lower part with
green color

out of the host cells and imported into the pathogen. However,
studying pathogen membrane permeability is not straightforward
and validation criteria based on nutrients transportation principles
are not easily applicable. The reason is that principles that govern
nutrients acquisition by pathogens, especially in mycobacteria, are
not completely understood (Niederweis, 2008). In particular: (i)
membranes and cell—wall systems of pathogens (e.g. cell envelope in
Mtb) are very complex systems and experimental procedures not
easily designed; (ii) identity and function of very few transporter
proteins is known for Mtb; (iii) specificity of the transportation
mechanisms (and the nutrients availability) depends on the location
of Mtb inside the host (e.g. phagosome, macrophages or dendritic
cells); (iv) uptaking processes often are dominated by direct diffu—
sion or porin—mediated diffusion which are again not understood
completely. Consequently, if a specific metabolite is not currently
known to be transportable across membranes, there is insufficient
evidence against this specific compound being hijacked and trans—
ported under some specific cellular conditions using specific mech—
anisms that are not yet known. That is, validation based on nutrient
acquisition principles is overly conservative.

As there is no gold—standard baseline for validating pathway—
based inference of host—pathogen interactions, some principles of
pathway interconnections between host and pathogen are proposed
in this section. This kind of analysis is essential for developing better
prediction approaches and can be applied to subsequent studies.
These principles go beyond classical performance evaluation met—
rics since they represent different levels of confidence on whether
Hi—Jack’s predictions are meaningful. The principles are:

1. Proportion of host and pathogen pathways containing
host—pathogen PPIs: High—conﬁdence computationally—
predicted host—pathogen PPIs suggests interactions between host
and pathogen. A metabolic pathway which has many proteins
involved in such PPIs therefore implies metabolic interference
between the two organisms, and further suggests co—localization
of proteins and sub—cellular localization of host and pathogen.
We obtained computationally—predicted human—Mtb PPIs from
Zhou et al. (2013) and Zhou et al. (2014). This dataset is an in—
tegrative collection of 1097 PPIs for the two organisms gener—
ated by a homology—based approach and a novel accurate
approach for predicting host—pathogen PPIs. For every predicted

host (resp., pathogen) pathway, we computed the number of
proteins in that pathway that have PPIs with the pathogen
(resp., host). Note that we performed this analysis twice, for
human and Mtb pathways.

2. Proportion of pathways that contain genes required for survival
and growth in the pathogen: Essential genes are critical for the
survival of an organism. Providing a more precise deﬁnition of
essential genes is not straightforward since different critical gene
sets depend on the circumstances and the environmental condi—
tions where the organism lives. Deﬁning these gene sets becomes
even more complicated when dealing with pathogens since
pathogens have some cell—autonomous functions and, at the
same time, they rely on host organisms. In Mtb, several experi—
mental studies use mainly transposon site hybridization
experiments (TraSH) to identify sets of essential genes. For
example Rengarajan et al. (2005) reports three gene groups
required by different stages of Mtb survival in macrophages.
However, the fact that the experimental conditions described in
these models are very speciﬁc is a limiting factor for generaliza—
tion. To describe in a more general way a pathogen’s life cycle,
in this study we focus on a list of 614 ‘universal’ essential genes
required for optimal Mtb growth. These genes derived from
TraSH experiments (Sassetti et al., 2003) are archived in the
DEG database (Luo et al., 2014). To use this information, we
compute the proportion of identiﬁed essential genes that are
mapped to different pathways assuming that pathways with
more essential genes are characterized as ‘essential pathways’
(Sassetti et al, 2003), which incorporate functions and mechan—
isms for producing or uptaking critical nutrients for growth.

3. Tissue-speciﬁcity of the host pathways: Obligate intracellular
pathogens are solely dependent on the host cell. Therefore, a
pathogen and its host—organism interaction targets are more
likely to be co—localized in speciﬁc tissues. In the case of Mtb, we
expect the predicted host pathways to be activated in tissues ac—
cessible by the bacterium, like lung tissue and lymph nodes. To
perform this analysis, we retrieved from the TIGER database
(Liu et al., 2008) a list of expressed tissues for every gene. From
them, we extracted the genes that are expressed in lungs and
lymph nodes. Then for every predicted pathway, we collected
the underlying genes and we mapped them to the list of genes
that are expressed in lung tissues and lymph nodes. To decide
whether a pathway is activated in a tissue we required a pre—
deﬁned number (e.g. 75%) of the mapped genes to be at least ex—
pressed in these tissues. Note that we searched for sufﬁcient
numbers of expressed genes and we did not decide based on the
actual expression levels. If we had decided based solely on ex—
pression levels, a few overexpressed genes might dominate our
estimations and we might conclude misleading results about
pathways activation in these speciﬁc tissues. As information of
expression in tissues is incomplete, the validation principle we
applied is necessarily quite loose.

4. Linkage of predicted pathways with known drug targets:
Development of anti—tuberculosis drugs is a cutting—edge re—
search area. High—throughput screening of chemical compounds
and computationally predicted drug targets are alternative
approaches that complement each other for this difﬁcult task.
Supporting Hi—Jack’s pathway predictions with known or pre—
dicted drug targets gives an indirect way to validate the results.
Drugs are bioactive molecules that target critical functions for
pathogen survival/growth. On the pathogen side, pathways
that contain many drug targets are more likely to take part in
hijacking processes. Being a drug target suggests that speciﬁc

reactions and mechanisms related to ‘molecular exchange’ are
present and activated in the pathogen. In other words, if a patho—
gen’s pathway allows a drug to be transported inside mem—
branes, it implies a direct host/pathogen interaction in that
pathway. We applied this analysis on the outcome of a large—
scale high—throughput screen that resulted in a catalog of 776
active chemical compound structures against tuberculosis
(Martinez—Jimenez et al., 2013). Alternatively, results can be
obtained using predicted drug targets for Mtb from Anishetty
et al. (2005).

5. Manual annotation of genes (if available), chemical compounds
and pathways: Finally, knowledge coming from experimental
procedures and evidence from the literature about genes with
signiﬁcant functional roles in tuberculosis further support Hi—
]ack’s predictions. Such examples are known Mtb virulent genes,
known transporter proteins, and processes related to core cellu—
lar functions like cell—wall synthesis and mycolic—acid biogenesis.

3.2 Applying Hi—Jack to Mtb metabolism

Here, we studied Mtb metabolism and report results obtained by
Hi—Jack. Overall, Hi—Jack identified hijacking phenomena between
36 human pathways and 46 Mtb pathways. We present in
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 the top—ranked pathways for both
organisms. These human top—ranked pathways have on average 17.9
hijacked reactions per pathway with the pathogen. In contrast the
rest lower—ranked pathways have 7.3 hijacked reactions per path—
way. Next, we studied further the KEGG classes that categorize
pathways according to their biological role; cf. histograms in
Figures 3 and 4.

We found that, in human, pathways that belong to carbohydrate
metabolism achieve the highest score, followed by pathways pertain—
ing to amino—acid metabolism, and pathways related to metabolism
of lipids. These findings are in agreement with the few known nutri—
ent—acquisition principles for mycobacteria, which identify trans—
porters of carbohydrates and lipids as well as up—taking mechanism
for amino acids (Niederweis, 2008). On the Mtb side, the top—
ranked pathways more often belong to carbohydrate metabolism
and amino—acid metabolism, and the list of pathways is quite simi—
lar to human pathways but enhanced with pathways related to bio—
synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and glycerophospholipids
indicating that the pathogen requires specific compounds for its
growth. Next, we retrieved compounds that are frequent hijacking
points from host, and we report in Supplementary Table S3 the top—
ten chemical compounds. Overall, we observe that the most—
frequent targets from human are lipids and compounds or molecules
that take part in fatty acid biosynthesis. Supplementary Table S4
illustrates the most frequently RPAIRS that are hijacked by the
bacterium. Based on this set of interconnected RPAIRS we report
candidate interactions between human and Mtb pathways. To
visualize the interconnections between host/pathogen pathways the
bipartite graph presented in Supplementary Figure S3 shows the
Mtb pathways that are connected with the top—3 ranked pathways in
human. Interesting is the fact that human glycine, serine and threo—
nine metabolism is potentially linked with 17 Mtb pathways, human
pentose phosphate metabolism with 13 pathways in Mtb and glycer—
ophospolipid metabolism with 1 1 Mtb pathways.

Next, using principles presented in the previous section, we sup—
ported our results by computational evidence. Figure 5 presents the
proportion of pathways in human that contain host—pathogen—PPIs.
As a control study, we partitioned initially the retrieved pathways in
two groups, one for those that hijacking occurs, and one for all the

other pathways where there is no hijacking score and thus hijacking
does not occur (Group C). Then we partitioned the group of hijacked
pathways in two equal size subsets: the first 50% of pathways corres—
pond to the top—ranked pathways (Group A) and the rest 50% to the
lower—ranked pathways (Group B). For each group, we computed the
proportion of human pathways in which human—Mtb PPIs occur. We
observe that only 20.4% of pathways that belong to Group C contain
human—pathogen PPIs. Group B, which is the group of lower rank,
has lower numbers of PPIs compared to Group A of higher ranks.
Supplementary Table 5 presents more details about pathways in group
A, as well as the exact number of host—pathogen PPIs per pathway.
Similarly, Figure 6 presents results for human—Mtb—PPI enrichment for
the Mtb side. Following the same control study as before, we gener—
ated three distinct groups, one that corresponds to the top—ranked
pathways for hijacking, one that corresponds to the lower—ranked
pathways for hijacking and one for all the other pathways that there
is no hijacking phenomena. In this case, it is again clear that the
groups of hijacking (Group A and B) achieve much higher numbers of
PPIs in the pathogen. Again the unranked pathways (Group C), which
correspond to the ‘no—hijacking’ case, achieve a much lower 27.1%
support from PPIs. Supplementary Table 6 presents more details
about the group of top—ranked pathways in Mtb, as well as the exact
number of host—pathogen PPIs per pathway. It becomes apparent that
the top—ranked pathways based on the hijacking score have higher
number of host—pathogen PPIs.

Regarding the set of essential genes required for optimal Mtb
growth, Figure 7 presents the proportion of pathways that contain
such genes in different groups according to their relative ranking.
Group C, corresponding to the ‘no—hijacking’ case, achieves 32.1%
support from essential genes, whereas Group A and B that corres—
pond to hijacked pathways have much higher support by essential
genes (86.9 and 78.2% resp.). Supplementary Table S7 provides
more detailed results for Mtb pathways belonging to the top—ranked
Group A.

As to the tissue specificity of the top—ranked pathways, we found
that all of the reported pathways have many genes (but not all) ex—
pressed in lungs and lymph nodes. In lungs pentose phosphate path—
way and fatty acid biosyntesis have the highest proportion of
expressed genes (82.1 and 83.3% resp.). In lymph nodes arginine and
proline metabolism has the highest number of expressed genes fol—
lowed by pentose phosphate metabolism. Overall we observe that the
number of expressed genes in the reported pathways in lymph nodes
is much lower than that in lungs. We thus infer that some candidate
hijacked pathways, such as alpha—linolenic acid metabolism, that has
few expressed genes in both tissues appear not promising candidates
for hijacking phenomena. Figure 8 presents the detailed results.

Next, we supported our results with predicted drug targets.
Figure 9 presents the proportion of pathways containing known drug
targets obtained from the TCAMSTP dataset (Martinez—Jimenez
et al., 2013) in Group A, B and C of human pathways. We found that
pathways involved in hijacking interactions have greater number of
drug targets compared to those that do not contain hijacked RPAIRS.
This confirms our initial hypothesis that pathways involved in hijack—
ing should have more mechanisms for molecular exchange activated.
Supplementary Table S8 presents more details for our top—ranked pre—
dicted pathways that are enriched in drug targets in Mtb.

As some of our indirect validation principles appear lenient
and the differences in the proportion of pathways supported by
host—pathogen PPIs, essential genes and drug targets sometimes look
relative small, we computed the per—pathway average number of
host—pathogen PPIs, essential genes and drug targets that corres—
ponds to groups of different rank. The results in Figure 10 convin—
cingly show that groups of higher rank achieve higher average
support by PPIs, essential genes for growth and drug targets.

We also computed an additional ‘strict’ performance metric,
which estimates the proportion of pathways in the pathogen that are
supported by essential genes for growth and drug targets and PPIs
with the host. These results are presented in Figure 11.

4 Conclusion

We proposed Hi—Jack, a novel computational framework for infer—
ring metabolic—pathway associations between host and pathogen.

The framework defines a metabolite—hijacking hypothesis and de—
ploys a simple filtering algorithm to rank host—pathogen interaction
pathways based on the idea of metabolite acquisition by the patho—
gen. We also proposed basic principles of hijacking interactions that
support our results by different levels of confidence, applicable in fu—
ture studies.

As a case study, we focused on Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and
we revealed possible mechanisms that support pathogen growth
and survival. We found that amino—acid metabolism, carbohydrate
metabolism, and pathways related to metabolism of lipids are top—
ranked pathways for both human and Mtb. For Mtb, frequent path—
ways are also related to lipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism,
as well as biosynthesis of fatty acids. In addition, our predictions are
supported by computational evidence, viz. host—pathogen—PPI sup—
port, significant number of essential genes for optimal growth and
known drug targets. Surprisingly, 91% of all ranked pathways
in Mtb are supported by at least one drug target. In addition,

tissue—specificity analysis for lung tissue revealed that the top—ranked
human pathways have a lot of expressed genes and thus, hosting
hijacking phenomena is possible.

Nonetheless, there is still space for improvements: (i) Integrating
metabolic network data from both KEGG and MetaCyc may improve
the quality of the results. (ii) We are planning to study more pathogens
like M. leprae, M. ulcerans and H. inﬂuenzae which appear to have
very different growth requirements, meaning that pathways required
for optimal growth, enzymes and transportation mechanisms are dif—
ferent from those in Mtb. (iii) Refining the hijacking hypothesis by
searching for compounds that satisfy a predefined similarity threshold
as defined by a compound similarity metric like Tanimoto coefficient
is very interesting extension. d/ From the software development per—
spective, the implementation of a more general algorithm that identi—
fies hijacking points given an arbitrary number of steps away from the
targeted reaction is an interesting idea for the future.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The prioritization and identification of disease-causing
mutations is one of the most significant challenges in medical gen-
omics. Currently available methods address this problem for non-syn-
onymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and variation in promoters/
enhancers; however, recent research has implicated synonymous
(silent) exonic mutations in a number of disorders.

Results: We have curated 33 such variants from literature and
developed the Silent Variant Analyzer (SilVA), a machine-learning
approach to separate these from among a large set of rare polymorph-
isms. We evaluate SilVA’s performance on in silico ‘infection’ experi-
ments, in which we implant known disease-causing mutations into a
human genome, and show that for 15 of 33 disorders, we rank the
implanted mutation among the top five most deleterious ones.
Furthermore, we apply the SilVA method to two additional datasets:
synonymous variants associated with Meckel syndrome, and a collec-
tion of silent variants clinically observed and stratified by a molecular
diagnostics laboratory, and show that SilVA is able to accurately pre-
dict the harmfulness of silent variants in these datasets.

ject website: http://compbio.cs.toronto.edu/silva

1 INTRODUCTION

The realization of the medical advantages of the personal
genome remains limited by our inability to identify the disease-
causing variation from the millions of non-functional (neutral)
single nucleotide, structural and copy number variants, which are
present in each individual’s genome. Despite the successes of
using genome sequencing to identify disease-causing mutations
in individuals with Mendelian disorders (Majewski et al., 2011b),
and cohorts of individuals with more common genetic disorders
such as autism (O’Roak et al., 2011), the prioritization of

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

variants based on their involvement in disorders remains a
signiﬁcant challenge (Cooper and Shendure, 2011). Methods
for the identification of disease-causing mutations typically use
one of two complementary approaches: statistical association
between a variant and a disorder, or the prioritization of all
genomic variants found in a genome based on their possible
functional effect.

In the statistical association approach, individuals with the
disorder (cases) are genotyped in parallel with matched controls,
and statistical tests are then used to identify variants that are
overrepresented in cases as compared with controls. Although
such tests have shown promise for identifying genes involved in
some common disorders, including autism (Wang et al., 2009)
and type 2 diabetes (Frayling, 2007), these tests are not applic-
able to rare genetic disorders, where unrelated individuals may
all be affected because of different (personal) variants within the
same gene or pathway. Approaches like the Cohort Allelic Sums
Test (CAST) (Morgenthaler and Thilly, 2007) and Combined
Multivariate and Collapsing (CMC) method (Li and Leal,
2008) aggregate the rare variants seen within a gene or a pathway
to mitigate this, but the applicability of association-based meth-
ods remains extremely limited for small cohorts.

The alternative approach of prioritizing disease-causing single
nucleotide variants (SNVs) based on their population frequency,
conservation and the type of change (radical versus conservative
amino acid change, introduction of a stop codon, etc.) has been
extremely effective at identifying causal non-synonymous muta-
tions in a number of Mendelian disorders, including Charcoti
MarieiTooth neuropathy (Lupski et al., 2010), HajduiCheney
syndrome (Majewski et al., 2011a) and Miller syndrome (Ng
et al., 2009). In this approach, the variants identified in the
genome are filtered to those with low allele frequencies
(common variants are unlikely to cause rare disorders) and are
sorted based on a ‘harmfulness’ score generated by tools such as
PolyPhen, SIFT or PANTHER (Adzhubei et al., 2010; Ng and
Henikoff, 2003; Thomas et al., 2003). Although some of these
functional variants may not be harmful, functionality is typically
used as a proxy for harmfulness within such tools, and we use the
terms interchangeably. Most recently, the SNV prioritization and
association-based approaches have been combined within the
VAAST method Wandell et al., 2011).

Tools for the prioritization of harmful non-synonymous vari-
ants typically consider multiple features that may affect the func-
tioning of the protein, including the level of conservation of the
changed residue, the severity of the amino acid change (a change
from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic residue is more likely to be
harmful than a change within one of these groups), the location
of the variant relative to functional regions of the protein, such
as active sites, and the likelihood that the mutation would affect
protein secondary or tertiary structure. These features are then
combined using either heuristic weights (Ramensky et al., 2002)
or more rigorous machine-learning frameworks (Adzhubei et al.,
2010; Thomas et al., 2003) to identify SNVs likely to have func-
tional effects. All of the features can contribute to the overall
success of the prioritization; however, the conservation of the
amino acid across evolution clearly has the strongest effect,
and some argue it may be sufﬁcient on its own (Cooper and
Shendure, 2011).

Although tools have been developed for the prioritization of
non-synonymous SNVs, and to a lesser extent copy-number vari-
ation (Hehir-Kwa et al., 2010), currently there are no methodol-
ogies for prioritizing functional synonymous SNVs. Most
pipelines for identiﬁcation of disease-causing mutations ﬁlter
out synonymous SNVs at the earliest stages, concentrating on
amino acid altering and regulatory variation. However, there is
growing evidence that synonymous SNVs affect protein splicing,
expression and ultimately function, and some of these SNVs
contribute to disease (see reviews: Cartegni et al., 2002;
Chamary et al., 2006; Sauna and Kimchi-Sarfaty, 2011). A syn-
onymous SNV may contribute to a phenotype in several ways,
including by changing the splicing pattern, the folding energy
and the structure of the pre-mRNA and the ultimate fold of
the protein by altering translation dynamics. Splice changes are
perhaps the best-studied effect of functional synonymous SNVs
(Cartegni et al., 2002). The creation or modiﬁcation of a splice
donor or acceptor site, or the binding site of a splicing enhancer,
silencer or regulator can lead to intron inclusion or alternative
splicing of the exon, and a drastically different protein product
(Drogemiiller et al., 2011). Synonymous substitutions that
change a common codon to a rare one, or Vice versa, can also
result in a different protein by affecting translational efﬁciency,
as is the case with a mutation in the CFTR gene associated with
cystic fibrosis (Bartoszewski et al., 2010). Additionally, synonym-
ous mutations have been shown to change the expression (Kudla
et al., 2009) and function (Cortazzo et al., 2002; Komar et al.,
1999) of proteins in Escherichia coli and play a role in substrate
speciﬁcity (Kimchi—Sarfaty et al., 2007) and cancer outcomes
(H0 et al., 2011) in humans, though the later claim has been
controversial (Renneville et al., 2011).

Several previous computational approaches have looked at
variation that does not alter the coding sequence, including
methods that evaluate the changes in RNA folding energies
and ensembles (Halvorsen et al., 2010; Salari et al., 2013;
Waldispiihl and Ponty, 2011) and studies that aim to identify
alternative splicing genome-wide by analyzing exonic splicing en-
hancers and silencers (Barash et al., 2010a, b). However, to our
knowledge, no current method combines multiple genomic fea-
tures to identify ‘silent’ genetic variants with functional effects.
Toward this end, we developed the Silent Variant Analyzer
(SilVA), a random forest-based prioritization method for

synonymous variants in the human genome. Our method con-
siders multiple features based on sequence conservation, splice
factor motifs, splice donor/acceptor sites, RNA folding energy,
codon usage and CpG content. We use a custom-curated dataset
of 33 rare synonymous disease-causing variants to train and
evaluate the overall efﬁcacy of SilVA, as well as two additional
datasets for independent validation, showing that SilVA is able
to accurately predict the harmfulness of silent variants in these
datasets.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

One of the challenges in investigating synonymous disease-causing vari-
ants is the relatively small number of known examples. We have curated
from literature a dataset of 33 rare (allele frequency <S%) synonymous
variants according to strict criteria: they must have been implicated in a
disorder and experimentally validated to affect splicing, transcript abun-
dance, mRNA stability or translational efﬁciency (Supplementary Table
Sl). For training and benchmarking negative controls, we used all rare
synonymous variants from an individual in the 1000 Genomes Project
(NA10851) (Durbin et al., 2010). We identiﬁed 758 variants with minor
allele frequencies (MAF) <S%. For case studies and validation, we
trained SilVA on the NA10851 variants, but used the 746 variants in
another 1000 Genomes Project individual (NA07048) during testing.
Fifty-nine variants were shared by both NA10851 and NA07048.

After developing and benchmarking the SilVA method, we obtained
two further validation datasets (Table 1). The ﬁrst contained seven syn-
onymous variants found in Meckel syndrome families (Khaddour et al.,
2007). Four of these variants were reported to be novel, of which two
(MKSl: E139E, TMEM67: A813A) were suspected to cause a Meckel
syndrome phenotype. The other three variants were predicted to be
benign polymorphisms, with minor allele frequencies of 177%.

We also obtained a dataset of 12 synonymous mutations encountered
by the Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory at the Hospital for Sick
Children (HSC; Toronto, Canada). Of these 12 variants, six were deter-
mined to be pathogenic by a molecular diagnostician, whereas the
remaining six were believed to be benign polymorphisms. Of the six
pathogenic ones, two were already in our training data, whereas the
other four were novel.

2.2 Features

We annotate each variant with 26 features across six categories: (i) con-
servation, (ii) codon usage, (iii) sequence features (CpG and relative
mRNA position), (iv) exon splicing enhancer and suppressor (ESE/
ESS) motifs, (v) splice site motifs and (vi) pre-mRNA folding energy
(Table 2).

The GERP++ score is used to measure the evolutionary conservation
at the mutation position (Davydov et al., 2010). Relative synonymous
codon usage (RSCU) (Sharp and Li, 1987) features are calculated using
codon frequencies in the Codon Usage Database (Nakamura et al., 2000).
Splicing regulatory features include the SR-protein motifs for SF2/ASF,
SC3S, SRp40 and SRpSO, scored using ESE Finder 3.0 with default
thresholds (Smith et al., 2006), the FAS-hex3 hexamer dataset from
FAS-ESS, used for the ESS6 features (Wang et al., 2004) and PESX
enhancer and suppressor octamers, used for the pESE and pESS features
(Zhang et al., 2005). The splice site motif strength features (MES) are
calculated using MaxEntScan (Eng et al., 2004). The change in free
energy from pre-mRNA folding (AAG) features are calculated with
UNAFold 3.8 (Markham and Zuker, 2008), and the ensemble diversity
(AD) features are calculated with ViennaRNA 2.1.1 (Lorenz et al., 2011).

Note: Of the eight pathogenic variants, two (those in TP53 and FGFR2) were
already included in our training data. We used SilVA to rank each variant relative
to all (746) rare putatively neutral synonymous variants in a 1000 Genomes Project
individual not used during model development or training (NA07048). The SilVA
method ranked all pathogenic variants higher than all polymorphic variants.
Moreover, we ranked 4/6 new pathogenic and putatively pathogenic variants as
more harmful than any control variant (a rank of 1). For all listed mutations, the
third codon position is affected.

Before training, we preprocess each of the features to have zero mean
and unit variance.

2.3 Selection of the random forest model

We compared the ability of ﬁve different methods, the GERP++ score
and four machine-learning models, to identify the deleterious synonym-
ous variants. These methods are:

(1) Sort by GERP++ conservation score. Mutations at more con-
served residues are ranked higher.

(2) Fisher’s linear discriminant (FLD). The variants are ranked by the
one-dimensional projected value.

(3) Support vector machine (SVMmap), using the nu-SVR regression
mode of the lib-svm toolkit, version 3.11 (Chang and Lin, 2011).
We then sort variants by the regression score.

(4) Neural network (NNet), with a single fully connected hidden layer
of ﬁve hidden units, using the PyBrain Python package, version 0.3
(Schaul et al., 2010). We activate the trained network on the test
SNVs and use the value at the output node to prioritize them.

(5) Random forest (Forest), with 1001 trees and the default number of
variables used for each split (the square root of the total number of
variables), using the randomForest R package, version 4.6%.
Variants are ranked by the number of votes, with the most popular
variants ranked highest.

For all of these methods, we trained predictive models using both
50/50 splits and leave-one-out cross-validation. For 50/50 splits, we
trained each model on half of the positive and negative examples (~17
known deleterious, 379 presumed benign or control), and then ranked the
remaining (16 known deleterious and 379 control variants). We excluded
from training any positive examples that occurred within the same gene
as any of the positive test mutations. Each method was then evaluated
according to the quality of the topmost predictions. We aggregated the
results across 50 iterations of training and testing, each time with a new
random subset of deleterious and control variants. As shown in
Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure S], the random forest method
outperforms the other methods and has more than three times the true
positive rate (at a false positive cut-off of 1%) as simply using the
GERP++ score.

To compare the prioritization performance of the ﬁve methods in a
more realistic scenario, we performed in silico ‘infection’ experiments
(leave-one-out cross-validation). In each experiment, we held out one of
the 33 deleterious variants and half of the control variants, and then used
each model to rank the held-out variant against the set of control vari-
ants. As in the 50/50 split, we excluded from training any positive
examples that occurred within the same gene as the held-out variant.
We repeated this process 10 times with different random subsets of

SVMmap, 9.8 for FLD and 4.6 for GERP++)

control variants and averaged the results. The prioritization performance
of the ﬁve methods is compared in Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure
S]. The random forest method achieved the best performance, ranking
the deleterious variant in the top ﬁve most harmful variants for ~15 of 33
deleterious variants (compared with ~5 for the GERP++ score by itself).

3 RESULTS

3.1 SilVA

To enable the automated prioritization of harmful synonymous
variants for medical sequencing projects, we developed SilVA.
For projects in which candidate non-synonymous variants
cannot be found, we offer SilVA as an effective method for
prioritizing the large set of synonymous variants that might nor-
mally be ignored. SilVA takes a list of variants in VCF format
and orders them by a computed harmfulness score. We then
expect a geneticist to evaluate the top several candidates based
on a review of the literature and potential functional effects. We
designed SilVA with this approach in mind, and SilVA is able to
rank harmful synonymous variants within the top five genome-
wide > 45% of the time.

SilVA is implemented using a combination of Python, Bash
and R and is freely available from http://compbio.cs.toronto.
edu/silva.

3.2 The SilVA score and classiﬁer

To score the potential harmfulness of the variants, SilVA first
annotates each variant with 26 features organized into six cate-
gories (Fig. 2A and Methods). SilVA then scores variants using a

random forest model trained on 33 synonymous harmful muta-
tions that we have identiﬁed from the literature (see Methods).
The SilVA score corresponds to the fraction of trees in the
random forest that predict the mutation to be harmful and is
significantly higher in harmful synonymous variants than in con-
trol variants, even for just variants near splice sites.

To evaluate the ability of the SilVA to differentiate between
harmful and benign variants, we measured the mean SilVA
scores for our harmful mutation dataset and common poly-
morphisms (MAF >5%), which are unlikely to be harmful. We
computed the scores of the 33 harmful variants using leave-one-
out cross-validation and the scores of all common polymorph-
isms from the 1000 Genomes Project (May 2011, phase 1, release
V2) and found the harmful variants to have a signiﬁcantly higher
mean score (0.322 versus 0.031, Student’s t—test: P 5 1.8 x 10‘7).
Further, we still achieve signiﬁcance when comparing against
rare synonymous variants from a healthy individual (0.322
versus 0.031, P5 1.9 x 10‘7, 1000 Genomes Project individual
NA07048), and even when we focus on just variants within
three residues of a splice site (0.544 versus 0.153,
P538 x 10‘6). Thus, the SilVA score is an effective tool for
prioritizing synonymous variants.

SilVA classiﬁes variants as likely benign, potentially patho-
genic or likely pathogenic based on their score to aid interpret-
ation. These score thresholds (of 0.27 and 0.485) correspond to
true positive rates of 52 and 33%, and false positive rates of <1 %
and 0.1%, respectively, when ranking all common polymorph-
isms from the 1000 Genomes Project. Because we expect harmful
synonymous variants to be extremely rare, we do not intend
SilVA to be used in the same way as typical non-synonymous

performances of sorting by the GERP++ score and a random ordering

harmfulness prediction tools and thus focus on ranking variants
instead of classifying them, though we also report classiﬁcation
results for each dataset.

3.3 Feature performance

To better understand the relative contributions of the features
used within SilVA and to explore the relative importance of each
category of feature, we compared SilVA’s cross-validation per-
formance leaving out different classes of features from the ana-
lysis (Fig. 2B). Removing features related to codon usage,
mRNA folding, splicing enhancer and suppressor motifs and
sequence (CpG, relative position in mRNA) does not substan-
tially affect performance. Removing either splice site features or
conservation (GERP++), however, causes SilVA’s performance
to drop substantially, with splice site features appearing to be
more informative than conservation for harmfulness prediction.

3.4 Disease SNV identiﬁcation

To further assess the performance of the SilVA method, we per-
formed in silico ‘infection’ experiments, where we add a known
deleterious variant to half of the variants in a human genome
(1000 Genomes Project individual, NA10851) and train SilVA on
the remaining variants. This leave-one-out cross-validation
method allows us to estimate the number of disorders for
which our method is able to rank the deleterious variant
among the top few variants genome-wide. As shown in
Figure 3, the SilVA method is able to consistently rank 1417
of the 33 deleterious variants within the top ﬁve variants (46%
on average). This suggests that in a large fraction of cases, SilVA
is able to effectively prioritize harmful synonymous variation in
human genomes. Of the 33 deleterious variants, 11 were classiﬁed
as likely pathogenic, 6 as potentially pathogenic and 16 as likely
benign. For comparison, of the rare synonymous variants across
82 CEU 1000 Genomes Project individuals, an average of <1
variant per genome was classiﬁed as likely pathogenic, 7 as po-
tentially pathogenic and 727 as likely benign. Variants that were

that are ranked within the top N variants

mistakenly classiﬁed as benign tended to be far from splice sites
and affect protein production by disrupting ESE/ESS motifs or
translational dynamics. Though we have features that attempt to
capture these mechanisms, the machine-learning algorithms did
not ﬁnd these speciﬁc features to be informative.

3.5 Validation on independent SNV sets

In addition to the cross-validation experiments described above,
we used two smaller independent datasets to validate the per-
formance of SilVA.

3.5 .I Meckel syndrome variants First, we used SilVA to predict
the harmfulness of a collection of synonymous SNVs reported by
Khaddour et al. (2007) across many cases of Meckel syndrome, a
rare fatal developmental disorder of the nervous system, kidney,
liver and lungs. Khaddour et al. describe seven synonymous mu-
tations in the MKSl and TMEM67 (MKS3) genes, of which
four are novel and three are known polymorphisms (minor
allele frequencies of 177%). Two of the novel mutations are sus-
pected of causing Meckel syndrome through the disruption of
splice donor motifs. These variants were not included in our
training dataset because they did not meet our criterion of ex-
perimental validation.

As controls, we used all (746) rare synonymous variants in a
1000 Genomes Project individual not used for training or bench-
marking (NA07048). In agreement with the literature, SilVA
ranks the two suspected harmful mutations (MKS1:E139E,
G>A; TMEM67:A813A, G>A) higher than every control vari-
ant (a rank of 1) and none of the remaining ﬁve mutations within
even the top 250 variants.

3.5.2 Variants from HSC’s Molecular Diagnostics
Laboratory The Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at the
HSC conducts Sanger sequencing for gene panels in patients
with suspected genetic disorders. Each variant is analyzed by a
molecular diagnostician, who classiﬁes it as benign or harmful
based on an interpretation of its likely molecular effect and a
literature review. The Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory pro-
vided us with six pathogenic synonymous variants and six
benign polymorphisms identiﬁed during their analyses, with
two of the pathogenic variants already appearing in our training
data. Similar to our analysis of the Meckel variants, we im-
planted the 10 remaining variants in a 1000 Genomes individual
(NA07048). As shown in Table 1, SilVA ranks all pathogenic
variants higher than all polymorphic variants, with two of the
four new pathogenic variants (and both of the ones in the train-
ing data) ranking higher than any control variants (a rank of 1).

3.6 Genome-wide comparison of polymorphisms and
random synonymous substitutions

The rate of synonymous substitutions is widely used as a proxy
for the neutral mutation rate, including for the purposes of
identifying selection on a gene (e.g. McDonald and Kreitman,
1991). However, a number of mechanisms have been studied,
including those discussed in this article, through which syn-
onymous substitutions can exert a phenotypic effect and thus
be selected against. Previously, there have been several attempts
to understand the fraction of synonymous sites that are under
constraint, and the strength of selection at these sites both
overall (see review: Chamary et al., 2006) and at speciﬁc loca-
tions such as exon splicing enhancers (Parmley et al., 2006).
The heterogeneity of both the genome and even individual
genes, and substantial methodological differences, have resulted
in widely varying estimates, with some suggesting that up to
39% of synonymous substitutions are under selection
(Hellmann et al., 2003). Simultaneously, all such studies have
used comparison of multiple mammalian genomes, and not
analysis of human polymorphisms; constraint observable from
human polymorphisms would represent generally stronger

selection, due to the small human effective population size
(Ne @104) (Tenesa et al., 2007).

Recently, Salari et al. (2013) compared the effects of common
human polymorphisms and random mutations on RNA struc-
tural ensembles, and found signiﬁcant evidence of ensemble-
stabilizing selection. If a signiﬁcant fraction of human
synonymous sites are under constraint and the SilVA score re-
ﬂects this, we would expect to see a difference in SilVA scores
between common synonymous polymorphisms and a matched
set of random mutations. We test this hypothesis by applying
SilVA to each synonymous SNP in NA10851 (9596 variants
with allele frequencies of 5795%) and a matched random syn-
onymous site within the same gene. The matched set of random
mutations was controlled for creation or destruction of CpG
dinucleotides and splice site proximity (the random mutation
created/destroyed a CpG site only if the synonymous variant
did, and whether or not the mutation was within three bases of
an exon boundary). We then compared the distribution of
SilVA scores for the two datasets. Although the mean observed
scores for polymorphisms and random mutations were similar
(0.031 and 0.034, respectively), the difference in the means is
highly statistically signiﬁcant due to the large number of data-
points (Student’s t-test, paired, P5 2.4 x 10*). The overall
higher scores of random mutations suggest that factors
beyond CpG and exon boundaries impose purifying selection
at synonymous sites of the human genome that is statistically
significant.

To further quantify this constraint, we measured the difference
in the number of random mutations and true polymorphisms
(Fig. 4) above a certain SilVA score. This difference can be in-
terpreted as the number of mutations ‘rejected’ during evolution
as being unfit, and represents synonymous sites under constraint
(Cooper et al., 2005). At a SilVA threshold of 0.005, we observe
626 more random mutations (6531) than true polymorphisms

Synonymous SNV harmfulness prediction

 

(5905). Thus, we estimate that 6.5% of potential synonymous
substitutions (626/9596 SNPs) have been rejected since human
divergence due to constraint beyond just Cst and splice sites.
Note that this is a conservative estimate, as there are likely add-
itional functional features in the genome that the SilVA score is
not modeling.

4 DISCUSSION

Current technologies are able to sequence a human genome rela-
tively cheaply and quickly, but the key bottleneck is the inter-
pretation of the variants to identify those that are most likely to
be related to an observed phenotype or a disorder. The auto-
mated prioritization of deleterious variants is an important step
toward the realization of genomic medicine. Although methods
for this task have been designed for non-synonymous coding
variation, many other types of variants are currently not prior-
itized, and are typically ignored in genome analysis pipelines. The
growing evidence that some of the ‘silent’ variation has import-
ant functional roles implies that effective prioritization is neces-
sary to explore such variation in medical sequencing studies.

In this article we present the ﬁrst method for the prioritization
of disease-causing synonymous SNVs based on a number of fea-
tures, including sequence conservation, splice sites, splice-regula-
tory motifs, codon frequency, CpG content and RNA secondary
structure energy. We have curated 33 such disease-related vari-
ants, and evaluated several machine-learning approaches for
prioritizing these from among a set of rare putatively neutral
SNVs. Our results indicate that splicing information and se-
quence conservation are currently the two most informative fea-
tures for identifying deleterious synonymous variants, and the
performance degrades without either of these features. The
random forest method outperforms other statistical learning
methods at prioritizing disease-causing SNVs, and yields variant
scores that are signiﬁcantly higher in known harmful variants
than in control variants. When a deleterious SNV is added to
a human genome, this method ranks the deleterious SNV among
the top ﬁve candidates for 15 of the 33 diseases and is able to
identify harmful variants in independent validation sets.
Together, these ﬁndings indicate that automated methods for
identification of deleterious synonymous SNVs can be useful in
parallel with methods that prioritize other types of genomic vari-
ation for the analysis of full human genomes.

Our method’s performance is currently limited by the small
number of training examples, but as more examples of patho-
genic synonymous variants are found, the model predictions will
only improve. Additional features can also be developed to better
address the mechanisms by which synonymous mutations can
effect change, such as better measures of exon strength, the
effect on RNA folding ensembles and the signiﬁcance of changes
to exon splicing enhancer and suppressor motifs.

As approaches for the stratification of different types of vari-
ants are developed, one natural extension of the current article
and the work on non-synonymous variation would be to design
an approach that would consider both types of variants, and
attempt to classify deleterious synonymous and non-synonymous
variants together.

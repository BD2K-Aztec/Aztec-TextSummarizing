ABSTRACT

Pythoscape is a framework implemented in Python for processing
large protein similarity networks for visualization in other software
packages. Protein similarity networks are graphical representations
of sequence, structural and other similarities among proteins for
which pairwise all-by-all similarity connections have been calculated.
Mapping of biological and other information to network nodes or
edges enables hypothesis creation about sequence—structure—func-
tion relationships across sets of related proteins. Pythoscape provides
several options to calculate painNise similarities for input sequences or
structures, applies filters to network edges and defines sets of similar
nodes and their associated data as single nodes (termed representa-
tive nodes) for compression of network information and output data or
formatted files for visualization.

1 INTRODUCTION

The rapid growth of databases of protein information (e.g. se-
quences and structures) provides both new opportunities and
challenges for analysis and clustering by similarity. For example,
global analysis of entire superfamilies and association of their
members with biological information and other types of meta-
data has become a useful tool for functional annotation and
discovery (Brown and Babbitt, 2012). As these sets become
larger (sometimes many thousands of sequences) and their mem-
bers more divergent, their fast exploration on a large-scale
becomes less feasible using traditional approaches such as align-
ments and trees.

Protein similarity networks (PSNs) enable analysis and Visual-
ization of structureifunction relationships in large protein data
sets by clustering of individual protein sets for more complex
analysis while summarizing ‘connectivity’ relationships among
the clusters. Mapping orthogonal sources of biological informa-
tion onto PSNs then provides a powerful way to View functional
trends across the set that can be interpreted in the context of their
similarities. (See Atkinson et al., 2009 for an initial analysis of
some uses and statistical validation of PSNs.)

While databases like Similarity Matrix of Proteins (SIMAP)
(Rattie et al., 2010) store pairwise similarities, and plug-ins

available with software such as Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011)
allow creation of small PSNs (Wittkop et al., 2010), no software
solution exists to create and manage large PSNs. And while
PSNs are inherently amenable to association with orthogonal
information sources, the many information types available com-
plicate development of a single software solution for managing
such diverse features. Pythoscape addresses these issues and pro-
vides a software framework to create PSNs and develop new
analyses for inference of functional properties in proteins.

2 DESCRIPTION AND SIGNIFICANCE

Pythoscape is an extensible computational framework imple-
mented in Python to generate and analyze PSNs. For the user
interested in generating large networks, the Pythoscape package
has a core set of plug-ins (Supplementary Table S1) and tutorials,
so that no development is needed to create simple networks
painted with useful metadata. For software developers, Pythos-
cape provides a framework for rapid modiﬁcation along with
well-documented application programming interfaces for devel-
opment of additional plug-ins using new sources of metadata.

Unlike sparser networks such as interaction networks, PSNs
are frequently close to complete, often requiring storage and
management of large quantities of data, and fast calculation
(Supplementary Table S2). Pythoscape allows for ﬂexible storage
of data through the use of storage interfaces. Appropriate stor-
age solutions can be chosen based on network size or developed
as needed allowing for easy updating for faster and more reliable
database software solutions. Pythoscape can create, store and
manage large networks, then, using representative nodes and
edges to compress the information, output smaller summary net-
works for Visualization (Fig. 1A and B). Users can choose how
distances between representative nodes are calculated and, im-
portantly, the full set of sequences in each node is retained for
later use.

Additionally, Pythoscape has plug-ins for creating structure
similarity networks and for generating correlations for edge
distances between networks generated from a set of sequences
and a corresponding set of available structures (Supplementary
Table S1 and Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3).

3 EXAMPLE USAGE

Glutathione transferases (GSTs) are enzymes that typically cata-
lyze the addition of glutathione to substrate compounds. They
play roles in many biological processes, including metabolism of
endogenous compounds and xenobiotics such as drugs. Of the

Fig. 1. Sequence similarity network of the GST superfamin generated by
Pythoscape and visualized in Cytoscape. To compact the View for this
ﬁgure, networks were layed out using the organic layout in Cytoscape
rather than the distances computed from a similarity metric. In all, 664
representative nodes are used to describe pairwise relationships among
7447 sequences. (A) Representative network with functional classes col-
ored, if annotated by SwissProt in a family (The UniProt Consortium,
2011). Family membership is indicated if one or more sequences in the
abstracted node are associated with that family. (B) Full non-abstracted
network for the group of GSTs found mostly in eukaryotes (boxed in A)

thousands of GSTs that have been identiﬁed, the physiological
substrates of only a small proportion are known; thus, they are
principally classiﬁed into putative functional classes according to
enzymatic, structural, and other features (Mannervik and
Danielson, 1988). Recently, PSNs have been used to summarize
and guide a global interpretation of GST sequence and structure
relationships (Atkinson and Babbitt, 2009).

A PSN of GST sequences is shown in Figure 1A (see supple-
mentary information for network creation and graph statistics).
It illustrates how representative nodes computed by Pythoscape
enable analysis of PSNs too large to be Visualized in total while
retaining their value for developing hypotheses from sequence
similarities across the whole set. For comparison, individual clus-
ters of interest can be outputted with all nodes present (Fig. 1B).
This full non-abstracted network (representing a node for each
sequence) shows a similar pattern of relationships to those shown
in the corresponding representative node network (boxed in
Fig. 1A). The correlation between the ideal representative node
mean distances calculated in Pythoscape and the corresponding
full network ideal distance for Fig. 1A is provided in Supplemen-
tary Figure S1. A quantitative description of the relationships

between filtered networks and full networks has also recently
been described elsewhere for some example systems (Atkinson
et al., 2009), but these differences appear also to depend on the
speciﬁc system analyzed. While ‘missing data’ is an inherent fea-
ture of representative nodes, the trade-off is in Visualizing simi-
larity relationships across large datasets that would not be
practically achievable because of memory and speed limitations
in their calculation.

The network shown in Figure 1A demonstrates another issue
in the use of representative nodes that could complicate inter-
preting relationships between functional features and sequence
similarity. In the example given here, some GST families are
represented by multiple representative nodes, whereas other rep-
resentative nodes contain multiple SwissProt families (HSP26,
Phi and Tau), obscuring how sequence similarity tracks with
annotation. Thus, we recommend that analysis using representa-
tive networks be accompanied by examination of the relevant
parts of the corresponding full networks.

4 CONCLUSION

Pythoscape is a software framework to efﬁciently create and
manage protein similarity networks. Tutorials, Pythoscape docu-
mentation, source code and future development plans are avail-
able at http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/trac/Pythoscape.

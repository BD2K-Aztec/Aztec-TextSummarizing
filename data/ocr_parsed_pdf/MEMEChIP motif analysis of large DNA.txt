ABSTRACT

Motivation: Advances in high-throughput sequencing have resulted
in rapid growth in large, high-quality datasets including those arising
from transcription factor (T F) ChlP-seq experiments. While there are
many existing tools for discovering TF binding site motifs in such
datasets, most web-based tools cannot directly process such large
datasets.

Results: The MEME-ChlP web service is designed to analyze ChlP-
seq ‘peak regions’—short genomic regions surrounding declared
ChlP-seq ‘peaks’. Given a set of genomic regions, it performs (i)
ab initio motif discovery, (ii) motif enrichment analysis, (iii) motif
visualization, (iv) binding affinity analysis and (v) motif identification.
It runs two complementary motif discovery algorithms on the input
data—MEME and DREME—and uses the motifs they discover in
subsequent visualization, binding affinity and identification steps.
MEME-ChlP also performs motif enrichment analysis using the AME
algorithm, which can detect very low levels of enrichment of binding
sites for TFs with known DNA-binding motifs. lmportantly, unlike with
the MEME web service, there is no restriction on the size or number
of uploaded sequences, allowing very large ChlP-seq datasets to be
analyzed. The analyses performed by MEME-ChlP provide the user
with a varied view of the binding and regulatory activity of the ChlP-ed
TF, as well as the possible involvement of other DNA-binding TFs.
Availability: MEME-ChlP is available as part of the MEME Suite at

1 INTRODUCTION

The genomic regions identiﬁed as bound by a transcription factor
(TF) in a chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing
(ChIP-seq) experiment are a rich source of information about
transcriptional regulation. These regions are deﬁned by mapping
the sequence tags to the genome, which identiﬁes ‘peaks’ of (direct
or indirect) binding by the ChIP-ed factor typically to a resolution of
about 100 bp. This high resolution is of obvious utility for identifying
which genes a TF regulates, but the genomic regions surrounding
the peaks are typically highly enriched for binding sites of the
ChIP-ed TF and other TFs. Hence, these regions can be mined

computationally to understand the roles, interactions and functions
of the ChIP-ed TF and its regulatory partners.

We describe here a web service called MEME-ChIP that
automatically performs ﬁve types of analysis on ChIP-seq regions.
(i) Ab initio motif discovery identiﬁes novel sequence patterns
(motifs) in the ChIP-seq regions that may be due to TF binding
sites. (ii) Motif enrichment analysis looks for enrichment of known
TF DNA-binding motifs in the data. (iii) Motif visualization displays
the relative locations and binding strengths of TF binding sites in
the input regions. (iv) Motif binding strength analysis computes
an estimate of the total DNA-binding afﬁnity of each input region
for the TF corresponding to each discovered motif. (v) Motif
identiﬁcation compares the ab initio motifs to known TF DNA-
binding motifs. The output of MEME-ChIP is thus a multifaceted
View of the identities, prevalence, DNA-binding patterns and
potential interactions of the ChIP-ed TF and its regulatory partners.

Ab initio motifs discovered in ChIP-seq data give an unbiased
View of the in viva DNA-binding propensities of TFs binding alone
or in protein complexes. MEME-ChIP employs two motif discovery
algorithms with complementary characteristics. The MEME (Bailey
et (11., 2006) algorithm uses expectation maximization (EM) to
discover probabilistic models of DNA-binding by single TFs or
TF complexes. MEME motifs can provide accurate thermodynamic
models of TF binding. MEME is complemented by DREME (Bailey,
2011), which uses a simpler, non-probabilistic model (regular
expressions) to describe the short binding motifs characteristic of
single eukaryotic TFs. DREME is often able to detect very short
motifs that are not found by MEME. MEME-ChIP also attempts
to identify the motifs found by MEME and DREME by comparing
them to a database of known TF motifs using the TOMTOM (Gupta
et (11., 2007) algorithm. Motif discovery thus identiﬁes novel binding
motifs and TFs that are regulatory partners of the ChIP-ed TF.

Motif enrichment analysis can identify additional regulatory
motifs whose enrichment in the ChIP-seq regions is too slight to be
detected by ab initio motif discovery. It achieves higher sensitivity
by limiting the search for motifs to a set of previously known TF
DNA-binding motifs. MEME-ChIP uses the AME (McLeay and
Bailey, 2010) algorithm for motif enrichment analysis.

For motif visualization and binding strength analysis, MEME-
ChIP utilizes the MAST (Bailey and Gribskov, 1998) and
AMA (Buske et (11., 2010) algorithms, respectively. MAST uses
a threshold-based approach to identify a putative set of non-
overlapping binding sites in the ChIP-seq regions for all the motifs
discovered by MEME (or DREME). This allows associations among
the locations of the different motifs (TF binding sites) to be seen by
eye. The AMA algorithm computes a thermodynamic estimate of
the average binding afﬁnity of the TF (as described by the motif)
for the each ChIP-seq sequence region.

MEME-ChIP

 

MEME-ChIP complements other web-based ChIP-seq
motif analysis tools. Like MEME-ChIP, the peak-motifs
algorithm (Thomas-Chollier et (11., 2008) performs several
analyses including a plot of the positional distribution of each
motif. Trawler (Ettwiller et (11., 2007) performs motif discovery
and (optionally) analyzes the conservation of predicted motif sites.
Peak-motifs and Trawler both perform word-based motif discovery.
MEME-ChIP does as well (via DREME) and complements this
with MEME, a non-word-based approach. Unlike MEME-ChIP,
peak-motifs and Trawler do not perform motif enrichment analysis
or motif binding strength analysis.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The MEME-ChIP web service simpliﬁes the analysis of ChIP-seq
data by executing a computational pipeline on a set of genomic
regions uploaded by the user. The uploaded regions should be
FASTA-formatted sequences of at least 100 bp in length, each
centered on a ChIP-seq tag peak. Prior to motif discovery and motif
enrichment analysis, MEME-ChIP centers and trims each sequence
to 100bp; the ﬁill-length sequences are used in the subsequent
motif visualization step. All trimmed sequences are input to the
DREME motif discovery algorithm, whereas, due to computational
complexity, a maximum of 600 sequences (randomly selected from
the input) are input to the MEME algorithm. MEME and DREME
output novel motifs as position-speciﬁc probability matrices along
with a wealth of other information about the motifs discovered.
MEME-ChIP runs the AME motif enrichment algorithm on all of
the trimmed sequences. AME computes and outputs the statistical
enrichment in the sequences of matches to each motif in the JASPAR
CORE database (Portales-Casamar et (11., 2010) of TF motifs. AMA
computes and outputs the average binding afﬁnity score for each
motif MEME ﬁnds and for each input sequence. MEME-ChIP uses
the MAST algorithm to visualize the locations of (putative) matches
to each of the MEME and DREME motifs in the untrimmed input
sequences. It also compares each of the MEME and DREME motifs
to each of the motifs in the JASPAR CORE database to identify
possible TFs binding to each motif.

3 EXAMPLE

To demonstrate the ﬁinctionality of MEME-ChIP, we use it to
analyze the ChIP-seq peak regions reported by Kassouf et (11.
(2010) for SCL (also called Tall), a key regulator of erythropoeisis.
(Complete results are available at http://meme.nbcr.net/meme/
doc/examples/memechip_example_output_ﬁles.) The two ab initio
motif discovery algorithms (MEME and DREME) and motif
enrichment analysis algorithm (AME) all identify a known SCL
binding motif. In the case of MEME and AME, the most signiﬁcant
motif found is a composite motif believed to represent binding of a
protein complex involving SCL and GATA-l, another transcription
factor that plays a central role in erythropoeisis (Fig. 1, column 1,
rows 1 and 3). The value of running two types of motif discovery
algorithms is illustrated by the fact that although DREME does not
discover this composite motif, it ﬁnds a better match to the canonical
SCL binding motif (Fig. 1, column 2, row 2) than MEME does.
Interestingly, DREME reports that the SCL motif is less signiﬁcant

in this ChIP-seq dataset than the canonical GATA-l motif is (Fig. 1,
column 1, row 2), suggesting that SCL binds more frequently in
complex with GATA-l than alone. This is supported by the fact that
the motif enrichment analysis by AME also reports that the canonical
SCL motif is less enriched than both the SCL-GATA-l motif and
the GATA-l motif (data not shown). In all, AME reports that the
SCL ChIP-seq regions are enriched for 15 known vertebrate motifs.
DREME reports nine signiﬁcant motifs, six of which match known
vertebrate TF motifs, and three of which are novel. MEME ﬁnds
three signiﬁcant motifs, one of which is novel. Such novel motifs
are possible candidates for further study, such as by using Gene
Ontology enrichment analysis (Buske et (11., 2010) to predict their
transcriptional roles. Additional details on the implementation and
use of MEME-ChIP are given in the Supplementary materials.

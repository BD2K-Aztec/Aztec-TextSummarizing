ABSTRACT

Motivation: MOBI is a web server for the identification of structurally
mobile regions in NMR protein ensembles. It provides a binary
mobility definition that is analogous to the commonly used definition
of intrinsic disorder in X-ray crystallographic structures. At least three
different use cases can be envisaged: (i) visualization of NMR mobility
for structural analysis; (ii) definition of regions for reliable comparative
modelling in protein structure prediction and (iii) definition of mobility
in analogy to intrinsic disorder. MOBI uses structural superposition
and local conformational differences to derive a robust binary
mobility definition that is in excellent agreement with the manually
curated definition used in the CASP8 experiment for intrinsic disorder
in NMR structure. The output includes mobility-coloured PDB files,
mobility plots and a FASTA formatted sequence file summarizing the
mobility results.

Availability: The MOBI server and supplementary methods are
available for non-commercial use at URL: http://protein.bio.unipd
.it/mobi/

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

NMR solved structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB;
Berman et (11., 2007) often contain an ensemble of structurally
different conformers, where each model equally satisﬁes the
experimentally obtained restrains. Among other reasons, differences
between models are due to incompleteness or noise in the
experimental data, as well as reﬂecting the dynamic behaviour of
proteins in solution (Felli and Brutscher, 2009; Foster et (11., 2007).
To gain insight into protein dynamics, the structural ensemble can be
ﬁirther enriched (Laughton et (11., 2009) or used to deduce quasi-rigid
dynamical-domains (Aleksiev et (11., 2009). In order to make sense of
this structural variability, e.g. to identify reliable regions for protein
structure prediction, it is commonly sieved for conserved regions
(Kelley and Sutcliffe, 1997; Konagurthu et (11., 2010; Theobald
and Wuttke, 2006) or to select the best representative (Tosatto and
Battistutta, 2007). An intuitive representation of NMR variability
through colouring of the structure by RMSD values has been recently
proposed in CARON (Sikic and Carugo, 2009).

Extreme structural variability in proteins is called intrinsic
disorder and commonly has functional implications (Dyson and

Wright, 2005). In the recent 8th round of the Critical Assessment of
techniques for protein Structure Prediction experiment (CASP8), 19
structures solved by NMR were evaluated in the disordered regions
prediction category (Noivirt-Brik et (11., 2009). The 18 structures
(one was fully disordered) with a PDB entry were visually and
manually inspected by the CASP assessors to determine which
amino acids do not have a ﬁxed conformation. To the best of our
knowledge, this was the ﬁrst and fully manual attempt to deﬁne
intrinsic disorder from NMR structural ensembles.

Here we present MOBI, a new web server to detect and visualize
mobile regions in NMR solved structures in analogy to intrinsic
disorder in X-ray crystallography. MOBI is based on a simple
algorithm to ﬁnd regions with different conformations among all the
models in an ensemble optimized to replicate the ordered-disordered
deﬁnition used in CASP8.

2 METHODS
2.1 Mobility deﬁnition

MOBI combines two basic measures of mobility, structural superposition
and changes in local conformation (i.e. torsion angles), into a consensus
deﬁnition. TM-Score (Zhang and Skolnick, 2004), a method designed to
superimpose models with identical sequence (e.g. comparative models or
NMR structures), is used to superimpose each of the models in a NMR
PDB ﬁle on all the other models. Distances between the same Cats in
all superimpositions are computed and scaled according to the formula
SD: 1/((1 +(d/d0)2), where d is the distance between two Cots and do is a
normalization factor. Average and standard deviation of the scaled distances
are computed. Secondly, (p and (It angles standard deviation for all the amino
acids in all the models are also computed. These are used to assign mobility
to neighbouring amino acids to those assigned as mobile according to SD
average and standard deviation. DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) is then
used to assign secondary structure to each of the models. If secondary
structure is the same for an amino acid in all the models (no coils), the
amino acid is not mobile, and if the secondary structure changes from model
to model it is assigned as mobile independently of the other criteria. Finally,
regular expressions are used to assign as mobile one or two ordered positions
surrounded by mobile residues, and to ﬁlter out single and two consecutive
mobile amino acids. A full description of the binary mobility deﬁnition can
be found in the Online Methods page.

2.2 Agreement with CASP8 disorder deﬁnition

The thresholds for each of the mobility measurements are optimized by grid
search to maximize the agreement with disorder deﬁnitions on the 18 NMR
solved targets evaluated at CASP8 with a corresponding PDB structure ﬁle.
Only amino acids with the same identity in PDB and the CASP8 sequence are
considered in the optimization. Residues with no coordinates in the PDB ﬁle
are also not considered. To optimize the agreement, do is set to 4A. SD, its
standard deviation and (p and (It angles standard deviation thresholds are set to

structure, containing 110 residues and 20 different models, was used in
CASP8 as target T0466. (A) The ensemble of 20 structures (left) coloured

0.85, 0.09, 20 ° and 20 0 respectively. The optimized binary deﬁnition has an
F value (the average of precision and recall) of 93.9, indicating almost perfect
agreement with the manual CASP8 assignment. See the Online Methods page
for a full description of the optimization protocol.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

MOBI has been implemented as a web server which uses a set of
Perl scripts and the Jmol (URL: http://www.jmol.org/) and Jalview
(Waterhouse et al., 2009) helper applications. In the following, we
will brieﬂy describe the MOBI input and output pages. Detailed help
pages and examples are available online.

3.1 Input

The server requires a PDB ﬁle which can be either selected by
PDB identiﬁer from the local PDB database or uploaded, but has

to conform to the PDB NMR structure speciﬁcation. Multiple
chains are supported. A sequence name and the E-mail address are
optional. A more complex interface allows the user to manipulate
various parameters used in the mobility deﬁnition. A batch mode for
processing multiple queries is also available.

3.2 Output

The output has been designed for usage to visualize structural
variability and the corresponding mobility deﬁnition in various ways
(Fig. 1) including binary mobility for each residue as a sequence
alignment (optionally in Jalview). The mobility is visualized in
Jmol from a modiﬁed PDB ﬁle (available for download) where
B-factors and occupancy are replaced either by scaled distance
or binary mobility, allowing easy visual interpretation. Several
plots are available in PDF format, describing mobility in terms
of structural superposition, torsion angle difference and consensus
binary deﬁnition.

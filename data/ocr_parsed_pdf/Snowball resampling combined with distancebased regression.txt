ABSTRACT

Motivation: Large-scale cancer genomic studies, such as The Cancer
Genome Atlas (T CGA), have profiled multidimensional genomic data,
including mutation and expression profiles on a variety of cancer cell
types, to uncover the molecular mechanism of cancerogenesis. More
than a hundred driver mutations have been characterized that confer
the advantage of cell growth. However, how driver mutations regulate
the transcriptome to affect cellular functions remains largely unex-
plored. Differential analysis of gene expression relative to a driver mu-
tation on patient samples could provide us with new insights in
understanding driver mutation dysregulation in tumor genome and
developing personalized treatment strategies.

Results: Here, we introduce the Snowball approach as a highly sen-
sitive statistical analysis method to identify transcriptional signatures
that are affected by a recurrent driver mutation. Snowball utilizes a
resampling-based approach and combines a distance-based regres-
sion framework to assign a robust ranking index of genes based on
their aggregated association with the presence of the mutation, and
further selects the top significant genes for downstream data ana-
lyses or experiments. In our application of the Snowball approach to
both synthesized and TCGA data, we demonstrated that it outper-
forms the standard methods and provides more accurate inferences
to the functional effects and transcriptional dysregulation of driver
mutations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent large-scale cancer genome studies such as those from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer
Genome Consortium (http://www.icgc.org) have led to the iden-
tification of a large number of somatic mutations in >20 cancer
cell types through high-throughput sequencing technology

(Alexandrov et al., 2013; Cancer Genome Atlas Network,
2012a, b). Among those somatic mutations, most are passenger
mutations, which do not contribute much to carcinogenesis.
However, a relatively small number of mutations have been
documented as driver mutations, and they confer the advantage
of cell growth. To date, more than a hundred driver mutations
have been uncovered. Some well-studied examples include
EGFR, BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, MET, CDKNZA and TP53
(Kandoth et al., 2013; Vogelstein et al., 2013). Understanding
the functional consequences of those driver genes and predicting
how they affect protein and cellular functions have become one
of the major focuses in cancer genomic research. For example,
the recurrent oncogene BRAF mutation at V600 has been well
documented as an activator of the mitogene—activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway that stimulates proliferation, whereas
mutation in tumor suppressor TP53 can disrupt cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis pathway in human cancer (Davies et al., 2002;
Gottlieb and Oren, 1998; Sumimoto et al., 2004; Wan et al.,
2004). Even though much effort has been expended to explore
speciﬁc pathways or biological processes dysregulated by driver
mutations, the systematic de novo identiﬁcation of potential tar-
gets on the transcriptome scale is still largely unexplored
(Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2013). Considering that a driver mutation
may affect a few or even many key signaling molecules in a
cellular system and cause diseases, a supervised analysis of
whole transcriptome measurements with regard to the presence
of a known somatic driver mutation can amplify important bio-
logical signals involving tumorigenesis. The standard statistical
methods that can be used for this purpose include gene-by-gene,
differential expression analyses to rank genes based on a para-
metric model, typically in a regression framework, and select the
top list with statistical significance (McCarthy and Smyth, 2012;
Robinson et al., 2010; Smyth, 2004). However, a driver mutation
is expected to alter the expression of its cognate genes, its inter-
acting genes and genes in the same downstream pathways. Gene-
by-gene analyses assume independence among genes and may
result in ineffective detection of important gene or pathway
targets. In addition, the genetic background of patients and
their tumor samples are highly heterogeneous: each sample
may exhibit patient-speciﬁc and sample-speciﬁc variation. This
differing predisposition to the driver mutation perturbation may
lead to different target gene expression patterns from sample to
sample and from patient to patient. Gene-by-gene analyses

Snowball approach

 

assume marginally uniform differential expression for each gene,
and this may culminate in detection power loss to key functional
targets. Lastly, the recurrent mutations are mostly rare events in
the patient population (Alexandrov et al., 2013; Kandoth et al.,
2013); thus, we typically have a limited sample size per mutation,
even if the sample size of the initial patient cohort is large. This
brings in another key challenge to the conventional methods for
the differential analysis of gene expression with mutation data.
Several multivariate statistical techniques were applied to
detect differential gene expression (Chilingaryan et al., 2002;
Lu et al., 2005). However, applications of well-established multi-
variate statistical techniques in this case are not straightforward
because of the unusual features in mutation proﬁling data, such
as high heterogeneity and limited sample size per mutation
status.

A different approach used for gene selection that may serve for
the same purpose is to utilize a non-parametric, ensemble
method to rank genes based on their classiﬁcation performance
on the mutation status and select the most relevant genes. For
example, Random forests based gene ranking and selection ap-
proach uses the classiﬁcation and regression tree model (CART)
and ranks the genes based on their variable importance (Chen
and Ishwaran, 2012; Diaz—Uriarte and Alvarez de Andres, 2006).
However, ranking and selecting genes based on the prediction of
the gene expression to the presence of a mutation might lead to a
gene list biased toward the classiﬁcation of mutation groups,
instead of the correlation with the functional consequences of
the mutation.

To meet the challenges of accurate inference on the functional
consequences of driver mutations, we propose the Snowball ap-
proach as a highly sensitive statistical analysis method, based on
the differential analyses of co-expression profiles relative to the
presence of a driver mutation. Gene transcriptions and their
interactions usually present in regulatory networks and/or biolo-
gical pathways; therefore, a driver gene mutation will naturally
trigger a differentially co-expressed gene expression pattern of a
series of genes between the patients with and without a driver
mutation. The Snowball approach takes advantage of networked
geneigene interactions and assigns a robust ranking to the gene
list based on their aggregated association of co-expression pat-
terns with the presence of a mutation in a resampling and dis-
tance-based regression framework. It then selects the top
significant list as target genes for downstream functional and
pathway analyses. To evaluate the performance of the
Snowball method, we applied it to both synthesized and
TCGA data, and demonstrated the superior performance when
compared with the gene-by-gene as well as Random forests-
based variable ranking and selection approaches. We also
demonstrated via functional analyses of the top gene lists that
the Snowball approach gives much more informative inference to
the functional effects and transcriptional dysregulation of driver
mutations.

Fig. 1. Schematic demonstration of the difference between gene-by-gene
and distance-based analyses. Gene expression proﬁles of multiple cancer
patients are measured in two mutation groups (mutated or wild type) and
additionally, those patients are under different disease predispositions (d1
and d2) such that gene expression proﬁles of the target genes perturbed
by the mutation will show different expression proﬁles between the mu-
tation groups. Although all genes (gligS) could clearly distinguish the
mutation and wild type groups based on their co-expression proﬁles, we
would miss the majority of them (g1, g3 and g5) if we applied a gene-by-
gene analysis, due to the small marginal differences of those genes be-
tween the mutation and wild type groups

of a driver mutation. It utilized a distance-based regression (DBR) frame-
work (McArdle and Anderson, 2001) in a resampling-based computa-
tional scheme to evaluate each gene for its aggregated association with
the driver mutation. At each instance of association assessment, a gene is
put in the context of a randomly selected set of other genes, and the
differential co-expression patterns of those genes with respect to the pres-
ence of a mutation are evaluated using the DBR model. Because co-ex-
pression distance matrices measure discrepancies of all coordinates
among the selected sets of genes, DBR can detect the subtle yet consistent
co-expression pattern changes disturbed by the mutation better than the
methods that can only detect overall mean differences (Fig. 1). This is
important, especially for patient sample studies, because the potential
variation due to heterogeneous genetic background (predisposition)
always exists among patients, and the only robust differential signals
may be presented as consistent differential co-expression patterns, instead
of marginal mean differences, in which case, DBR provides a more suit-
able statistical model for assessment.

We illustrate the workﬂow of the Snowball approach in Figure 2, and
demonstrate the following below: the feature selection concept applied in
the Snowball approach, formulation to aggregate the association assess-
ment for each gene from the resampling, distance-based regression frame-
work and the statistical signiﬁcance test based on the aggregated
association score. Finally, we list the computational algorithm we imple-
mented in our software based on the Snowball approach.

2.2 Gene selection procedure

Let X denote the gene expression data matrix with dimension M x n,
where gene expressions of M genes, x1, x2, . . . , xM, are measured on n
samples, s1, sz, . . . ,sn. Let X; denote all possible subsets of d genes from
the original M genes, and X); C X; denote the sets, in which the selected
d genes contain the gene xi. Assume that we also have a known mutation
status label K=(K1,K2, . . . ,Kn)’, which is a binary vector that labels n
samples into the group with and without mutation, i.e., K,- =1 or
0, i = 1, .. . ,n. The gene selection method in general defines a procedure
that optimizes a criterion function J, which measures the association
strength of each gene with regard to the mutation status. Thus, all
genes can be ordered based on J, and the largest J values correspond
to the most relevant genes. We use J(x) to be the mean association

Fig. 2. Snowball workﬂow. Firstly, a whole genome gene expression matrix combined with a known driver mutation measurement on a patient cohort is
resampled on gene dimension to generated B number of matrices with a ﬁxed number of d genes, each containing a speciﬁc gene Xi. Secondly, the resulting
matrices are further resampled on the sample dimension to obtain an equal number of samples within each group. Thirdly, distanced-based regression is
applied to evaluate the association of genes in each subsampled matrix with respect to the mutation status of the corresponding patients, and the resulting
association scores of gene X,- are augmented to calculate the aggregated association score J”. Lastly, the robust distance measurements are calculated based
on the aggregated score J”, and the significantly outstanding genes with more extreme J” values from the genome background are selected

measurement of any set of multiple genes that contains x with respect
to K,

100 = E{¢(g(XX), K)} (1)

where XX 6 X3; g(XX) denotes a dissimilarity matrix calculated based on
the co-expression proﬁles of a set of d genes that contain gene x, which is
denoted as XX; (1') is a testing function that evaluates the association be-
tween X" and K. The expectation here is taken uniformly over all ran-
domly resampled subsets in X5.

2.3 Aggregated association score of target gene

The number of subsets in X; with size d selected from M genes is
(15?? = w. This number can be very large, even for moderate
values of M and d. We instead use a bagging estimate of J(x) formulated

below,
1 B 1 K
W) = 3 XXX) ¢.(g(X.-,,-), K), X,- e X; (2)
i=1 j=1

Here, each X“- consists of some columns in X,-, which are resampled
randomly with a stratiﬁed sampling scheme so that the same number
of samples (columns) are drawn from each of the two mutation status
groups. The data matrix are resampled K times. At the same time, on the
gene dimension, we sample from the space X"; with a ﬁxed size d, and a
total of B subsamples are generated.

2.4 Distance-based regression assessing the association of
gene set with respect to mutation status

We adapted the distance-based regression method developed by McArdle
and Anderson (2001) to assess the association of mutation status with the
dissimilarity matrix deﬁned on the co-expression proﬁles of multiple
genes.

A distance-based regression requires a matrix of dissimilarity between
pairs of samples. It then swaps the roles of mutation status variable and
the dissimilarities by treating the dissimilarities as outcome variable and
the mutation status as the predictor variable. Similar to the least square
setting for multivariate analysis of variance, as suggested in McArdle and
Anderson (2001), a pseudo-F statistic could be used to test the null hy-
pothesis of no association. By using the duality of tr(AB)=tr(BA), we
can construct the similar testing framework based on the dissimilarity
matrix. More speciﬁcally, let D be the co-expression dissimilarity

matrix with elements d,-,~, and it is converted to an association matrix,

A, with elements ail- : — dij2/2, then matrix A is centered based on,

1 , 1 ,
G=(I—;11)A(I—;ll) (3)

where 11’ is a matrix of ls. A pseudo-F statistic can now be constructed
using the matrix G to evaluate the association of the mutation label K with
the pair-wise, co-expression dissimilarities D according to

: tr(HGH)/(d — 1)
"((1 - H)G(1 - H))/(n - d)

Here, H is a projection matrix, H = y(y’y)’1 y’, and y is the centered mu-
tation vector with elements y,- =K,- —  1Kj/n. The F statistic provides
the functional form of (1),, in Jn(x) to evaluate the association between
X“- and K. Because the degrees of freedom (d — 1) and (n — d)
are not necessary, as they remain constant for all X ,- J,
we let ¢n(X,,J-, K) = tr(HGH)/tr((1 — H) G(I — H)), for all
i=1,...,B;j=1,...,K.

Different forms of similarity measurement can be applied in the above
framework. For example, we can use the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient
cor(i, J)-based matrix, which measures the pair-wise linear correlation
between the ith and jth columns of X“. The sign-preserved similarity
matrix S with elements s,-j=(1-l-cor(i,j))/2 and the corresponding dis-
similarity matrix D= 1 — S is used as the default co-expression proﬁle
distance in the Snowball software package.

2.5 Statistical signiﬁcance test for gene selection

The distributional properties of J” based on the pseudo-F statistic are
unknown. Our approach is to consider J” as arising from some genome-
wide distribution, which represents ﬂuctuations in mean level among genes.
Genes with unusual values of J”, relative to the genome background
distribution, indicate their relatively unusual roles in relation to the muta-
tion status K. Speciﬁcally, we use Robust Mahalanobis Distance (RD),

A71
Imam» = (J. — [NZ (J. — 12) (5)

where ([1,, i) are the minimum covariance determinant (MCD) estimates
of the location and scatter computed with the FAST-MCD algorithm by
Rousseeuw and Van Driessen (1999). Here, under the null hypothesis that
there is no association, RD asymptotically follows a X2 distribution with
df. = 1.

Snowball approach

 

2.6 Snowball algorithm

Let X, as previously deﬁned, be the whole genome gene expression data
matrix of M genes, x1, x2, . . . , xM, measured on n samples, s1, sz, . . . , s".
The Snowball algorithm below calculates all Jn(x,-) and RD(J,,(x,—)), and
computes the P-values of each gene based on the null distribution
of RD(J,,(x,—)) formed as a genome-wide background. The Snowball
algorithm consists of the following steps.

(1) Randomly select d rows of X and call it X1

(2) Obtain X 1’1, X 1’2, ...,X1,K by independently resampling the col-
umns of X1, so that equal number of samples are selected in each
group, as speciﬁed by K

(3) For each data matrix X 1,1, I: 1, 2, .. . , K, calculate the co-expres-
sion dissimilarity matrix D = 1 — S, where the elements of D and S
are dil- = 1 — Si]- and Si]- = (1 -l- cor(i,j))/2, measuring the co-expres-
sion dissimilarity (d,,) and similarity between the ith and jth
columns of XL,

(4) Calculate A = (ail) = (—d?j/ 2) and obtain the centered similarity
matrix G=(I— % 11’)A(I— £113
(S) Calculate the projection matrix H = y(y’y)’1 y’, where y is the cen-
n

tered mutation vector with elements y,- =K,- — Zj: 1Kj/n
(6) For each data matrix X1), calculate ¢n(X,-J-,K) based on

_ t (HGH)
¢n(X 131' 1 K) ’ tr((I:H)G(IiH))

(7) Compute @(Xi, K), the bootstrap elsftimate of the association of X1
with K, based on 11),,(Xi, K): %Zj:1¢n(Xm-, K)

(8) Repeat steps 1-7 (B7 1) times to obtain X2, X3, , X B, and calculate
¢n(X1,K),¢n(X2,K), ,¢n(XB,K)

(9) Evaluate Jn(x,-) for all genes x,, i = 1, 2, , p,

(10) Calculate Robust 1 Mahalanobis Distance

RD(Jn(xi))=(Jn _  (Jr! — 

(11) Compute P-value of each gene based on the genome-wide back-
ground distribution of RD(J,,(x,—)), which approximately follows a
x? distribution

(12) Adjust for multiple testing based on the P-values from step 11 and
select the top genes with adjusted P-values less than the given
cutoff (e.g. select ones with FDR adjusted P<0.0S)

2.7 Choice of d, B and K

Operating parameters d, B and K affect the performance of Snowball. d
and B control the resampling depth on the gene dimension, while K
mainly controls the resampling depth on the sample dimension.
Because every gene needs to be resampled at least once, this puts a min-
imum requirement for d and B.

2.7.] Minimum requirement of d and B Let A be the event that
each gene is selected at least once by the resampling scheme of the
Snowball algorithm. Assuming we have M total number of genes, the
probability of A given d, M and B is (see Supplementary Materials for
derivation and proof),

( d )3
Mid - .
Pr(Ald, M, B)=1 _ ZHWC) L (6)

 (:1

As a demonstration, for M = 1000, we calculated and plotted this
probability Pr as a function of d and B (Supplementary Fig. S2), where
d varies from 1 to 200 and B varies from 1 to 2000. We can see
that Pr(A ld, d, M, B) quickly reaches 1 as d and B increase. This indicates
that the more genes we include and more bootstrap samples we use, the
more likely each gene is selected at least once by the resampling. Based on
this, the minimum requirement for d and B are those that deﬁne the
boundary of the plateau for Pr equal to 1 (Supplementary Fig. S2).

2.7.2 Resampling depth B has the most impact on the performance
of Snowball. Larger B values give better resampling depth on the gene
dimension and largely improves the performance. On the other hand, (1 or
K has a relatively minor effect on the overall performance, especially
when the sufficient gene level resampling is reached with a large B.
More speciﬁcally, the sensitivity of Snowball slightly decreases as (1 gets
larger. However, the difference is negligible when B is large
(Supplementary Table Sl). In real data analysis, we suggest to choose a
large B that users can utilize based on the available computing power.
However, the sensitivity is saturated when a sufﬁciently large B is
reached. The gain on performance is ﬂattened after reaching the satur-
ation point (Supplementary Fig. SS). Sensitivity also increases as K in-
creases. The best K is essentially deﬁned by the sample level variation:
more variation in samples would require a deeper sample level resampling
with a larger K. The effect of K is more obvious when B and K are small
but diminishes as B and K increase. In our real data analysis, different
but sufficiently large K values show consistent results (Supplementary
Fig. S4).

Both our case study and simulation experiments demonstrated that the
Snowball approach is robust for a wide range of operating parameters
(Supplementary Figs. S3785). In addition, we demonstrated the better
performance of Snowball with respect to LIMMA and Random forests
in a wide range of variance/covariance setups when the sufficient resam-
pling depth is reached (Supplementary Fig. S6).

Based on our simulation experiments, as well as real data analyses, a
good choice of d would be somewhere between 10(F300. Regarding the
choice of B, the larger, the better. However, B is limited by computing
power, so we suggest to choosing the largest workable B values or a B
that reaches the saturation point. Insufficient resampling with small B
values does not hurt the speciﬁcity, but it limits the power of identiﬁca-
tion (Supplementary Fig. SS). Good K and B can be chosen based on how
many new identiﬁcations can be achieved with a larger K or B. It is
eventually not cost effective to use an even larger K or B when they
reach the identiﬁcation plateau (Supplementary Fig. SS). d, B and K
values used in our simulation and the case study are reported in
Supplementary Table S3.

2.8 Simulation

We performed a set of simulation experiments to evaluate the perform-
ance of the Snowball method. The goal is to assess the sensitivity and
speciﬁcity of the Snowball method in detecting the subset of genes that
are differentially expressed from the synthesized datasets with known
gene expression proﬁles. This evaluation was done in comparison with
two standard approaches including: (i) a linear regression based method
(Smyth, 2004) implemented in R package limma (Version 3.18) released
in BioC (Release 2.13), and (ii) a Random forests based variable selection
(Breiman, 2001) using R package randomForest (Version 4.6), denoted as
LIMMA and Random forests, respectively.

In order to generate the synthesized dataset with realistic data patterns,
we used the E. coli gene expression dataset mimicking the data patterns
under genetic perturbations over a regulatory network as the genetic
background (M3D Database) (Faith et al., 2008). The unique features
in this dataset that meet our speciﬁc simulation needs include: (i) differ-
ential gene expression patterns generated by an induced genetic perturb-
ation, such as knock-down, over-expression or mutation, and spread over

the underlying regulatory network to penetrate their functional inﬂuence
over many target genes; (ii) gene expression proﬁle changes that are in-
trinsic to networked gensgene interactions; and (iii) a variety of genetic
perturbations with different sizes of differentially expressed gene sets,
providing the ﬂexibility to the assessment of method performances
under different scenarios.

To simulate the gene expression proﬁles in a multisample experiments
from a clinical study, we added a nonlinear distortion (corresponding to
the variation due to individual predisposition) and random noise (corres-
ponding to sample, gene, group-level variation or random error) to the
above synthesized gene expression proﬁles so that we can mimic the
acquired biological replicates under either wildtype or disturbed
conditions.

The distortion step was based on that each replicate measurement is a
transformed signal of the true proﬁle based on a sigmoidal-shaped rela-
tionship, which is defined as y = b-l- %, with randomly generated
center and slope parameters c and s. The parameters a and b are calcu-
lated based on a = max (x) and b = min (x), so that the resulting distorted
proﬁles (y) are in the same range as the original proﬁle (x). We demon-
strated 20 distorted proﬁles as a function of the original true one based on
a randomly generated set of c and s (Supplementary Fig. Sl). This data
pattern is typically observed in gene expression microarray data.

Additionally, a hierarchical lognormal-normal model suggested by
Kendziorski et al. (2003) and Lund and Nettleton (2012) was used to
add statistical randomization and noise to the true proﬁles (after the
distortion transformation). Therefore, we assume the log scale observa-
tion of the jth gene from the ith subject under expression pattern g (pat-
tern of any combination of mutation and wildtype) can be written as

yji = M ‘l‘ TngU) ‘l‘ Eji (7)

where rj~N(0, of), eji~N(0, 02), and 11. represents the average expression
of all genes across all groups, erg(i) represents a random group effect for
observations from the Gg(i)’h group (under pattern g) in the jth gene, and
6,,- represents a random error.

We used all genes (P = 4298) in the E. coli gene expression dataset
obtained from the M3D database. The ranges of the sigmoidal-shaped,
nonlinear distorted profiles are in the same range as those of the original
true proﬁle. The center parameters of sigmoidal-shaped transformation
were randomly generated based on a normal distribution with mean and
standard deviation (8) taken from the median of the original proﬁle and
10% variation of the original median, respectively, and the slope param-
eters were randomly generated from a uniform distribution between 0.05
and 0.2. The size of the differentially expressed gene sets disturbed by a
driver mutation likely varies among speciﬁc driver mutations. This per-
turbation size intuitively might be an important factor that inﬂuences the
detection performance. Comparison among different perturbation sizes
gives valuable information about the robustness of the methods and their
applicability to a broad range of driver mutations. Therefore, in our
simulation, we chose three different genetic perturbations with different
sizes, 30, 300 and 800 genes out of the full list of 4298 genes, and then
compared the performance of Snowball with the LIMMA and Random
forests for each perturbation size. The parameters used in the LNN
models were 0,: 1.39, 0:0.33 (Kendziorski et al., 2003), and 1: was
added after the nonlinear distortion transformation to the original
proﬁles.

2.9 Case study

BRAF diver mutation (V600) is critical for the initiation of melanoma
and has been shown to recur at position 600 (90% of which are V600E) in
approximately 50% of melanoma tumors (Kandoth et al., 2013; Lovly
et al., 2012; Rubinstein et al., 2010). Speciﬁc inhibitors (e. g. Vemurafenib)
targeting on this mutation are available. This recurrent driver mutation
was considered an ideal case to study its functional consequences. We
obtained the whole genome gene expression data with corresponding

BRAF mutation proﬁle, including 34 BRAF V600E and 27 BRAF wild-
type primary tumor samples of cutaneous melanoma from the TCGA
data portal. Snowball, Random forests and LIMMA were applied and
compared in identifying the genes whose expression exhibited statistically
signiﬁcant association with the BRAF mutation status of the samples.

To assess and compare the functional relevance of the gene lists iden-
tiﬁed from the three methods, we collected 1028 signiﬁcant genes identi-
ﬁed based on a differential analysis of matched normal human
melanocytes with and without BRAF V600E from an independent
knock-down experimental dataset (Flockhart et al., 2012).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulation results

To assess the effectiveness of Snowball, we performed the simu-
lations as described in the Methods section under nine scenarios,
and compared the performance of our Snowball with LIMMA
and Random forests approaches, chosen to represent respectively
parametric versus non-parametric as well as correlation versus
classiﬁcation based methods. We set the nine scenarios based on
two factors: the size of the disturbance measured by the number
of genes that were differentially expressed induced by the genetic
perturbation, and the sample size of the study. Both factors have
a key impact on the discovery success of any similar methods.
We purposely vary the disturbance size on a wide range from 0.7
to 18% of the total genes so that we can evaluate the robustness
of the method with this key parameter. The small sample size of 3
or 10 was chosen based on the fact that somatic mutations are
highly heterogeneous with tremendous variation among individ-
uals, and the majority of mutations only recur in a very limited
number of patients. The large sample size of 100 was chosen to
evaluate the performance of Snowball when the sample size is in
the ordinary range of LIMMA and Random forests for sufﬁcient
statistical power. However, identification performance is a func-
tion of variance/covariance structure speciﬁed by the parameters
8, o and a, on the simulated data. For data with more noise or
between-sample variation, LIMMA or Random forests could
require much larger sample sizes to reach the equivalent perform-
ance of Snowball (results not shown).

For each scenario, we computed the receiver operator charac-
teristics (ROC) curves, where all genes were ranked based on the
increasing P-value in Snowball and LIMMA cases, and the
decreasing Gini index in the Random forests case. Those ROC
curves showed the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the claimed dif-
ferentially expressed genes as the selection cutoff value varies. To
compare the overall performance of the three methods under the
different scenarios, we computed the area under the ROC curve
(ROCAUC) using R package ROCR 1.0 (Sing et al., 2005).
Table 1 recorded the mean ROCAUC and its standard error
based on 25 random runs of all three methods under each scen-
ario. We found that the Snowball approach substantially outper-
formed LIMMA and Random forests for the scenarios with
small sample sizes (3 or 10 samples in each group) and performed
comparably well when the sample size was in the ordinary range
(100 in each group) that is typically needed by LIMMA and
Random forests for sufﬁcient power. These results also demon-
strated that the Snowball approach could more robustly rank the
true targets with signiﬁcantly better accuracy regardless of
the size of the disturbance or the sample sizes of the datasets.

3.2 Case study results

Snowball, Random forests and LIMMA approaches were com-
pared when applied to our case study dataset (see the Methods
section) for the identiﬁcation of the top gene list whose expres-
sion profile exhibited signiﬁcant association with the BRAF mu-
tation status. In addition, we computed the overlap with the
significant gene list obtained from the differential analysis of
BRAF V600E versus BRAF wildtype genetically matched mel-
anocytes from the same person in a knock-down experiment
(refer to as KD list or KD data below, more details can be
found in Methods section).

3.3 Comparison of functional implication from top gene
lists

To assess the performance of Snowball in identifying the func-
tional targets, we compared the functional implication of the top
gene lists detected by Snowball, Random forests and LIMMA
from the case study dataset. Because top genes are considered to
play important roles in melanoma development and cancer for-
mation, we compared the top 400 genes from each method and
found substantial differences among the lists (Fig. 4A). We add-
itionally analyzed the signiﬁcant gene list identiﬁed from
Snowball for the enrichment analyses of gene networks and bio-
logical pathways using IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, http://
www.ingenuity.c0m). Because Random forests and LIMMA
lacked power to identify enough genes, we used the same
number of top genes as those identiﬁed by Snowball for
LIMMA and Random forests, so we can compare among the
three methods on the same enrichment analyses. We retrieved the
top ﬁve canonical pathways, up-regulators and molecular and
cellular functions from the IPA analysis, and then
compared among the three approaches (Table 2). Interestingly,
we observed that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling and

lipopolysaccharide/interleukin-1 (LPS/IL-l)—mediated inhibition
of the RXR function, from the canonical pathways category,
were the most over-represented in the gene lists from the three
approaches. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway
belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix/per-arnt-sim family of tran-
scription factors, which has been suggested to regulate xenobiotic
metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 enzymes and has
also been demonstrated to cross talk with MAPK pathway
(Borlak and Jenke, 2008; Chiaro et al., 2007). LPS/IL-l-
mediated inhibition of RXR function plays an important role
in ligand-controlled transcription factors that functionally regu-
late cancer cell growth and survival (Altucci et al., 2007). Among
the three approaches, Snowball showed more significant P values
of these two pathways (Table 2). Meanwhile, another top en-
riched pathway, inhibition of angiogenesis by TSPl, was exclu-
sively detected by Snowball. The silenced TSPl was reported
previously that could lead to antitumor inﬂuencing on decreasing
murine melanoma growth (Lindner et al., 2013). Furthermore,
we examined the top enriched regulators and found that most of
them are cancer related including regulators TGFBl (Lasfar and
Cohen-Solal, 2010), TNF (Gray-Schopfer et al., 2007; Tanaka
et al., 2014), IFNG (Ikeda et al., 2002) and MITF (Bollag et al.,
2010; Garraway et al., 2005; Nazarian et al., 2010; Wellbrock
and Marais, 2005; Yokoyama et al., 2011). In particular, the up-

Snowball approach

 

regulated MITF has been well documented to be hyper-activated
by the driver mutation BRAF (Garraway et al., 2005; Wellbrock
and Marais, 2005; Wellbrock et al., 2008; Yokoyama et al.,
2011). Consistently, the gene expression of the target genes of
those top up—regulators are highly signiﬁcant (P<0.001)
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Lastly, in the category of molecular
and cellular functions, three common functions were identiﬁed
by all the three methods; however, Snowball reported much
higher statistical signiﬁcances with more genes in each function
category. Among those functions, for example, cellular growth
and proliferation has been reported to be promoted through
MAPK pathway via the gain-of—function BRAF mutation. In
summary, Snowball is more powerful to identify melanoma
related regulators and pathways initiated by a key driver muta-
tion (BRAFV600).

3.4 Comparison with KD list

Next, we compared the top genes from the three methods to
examine the number of genes overlap with the lists obtained
from the KD data. The top 1000 genes detected from each
method were compared with the KD list to calculate the cumu-
lative overlap rate in the increasing order of 100 genes (Fig. 4B).
Our results revealed that Snowball exhibited the best overlap rate
among the three methods with substantially more genes, suggest-
ing the superior performance of Snowball in identifying the func-
tionally relevant genes targeted by the regulation of the driver
mutation.

4 DISCUSSION

In cancer genomics, interpreting the consequences of genetic
changes, such as somatic mutations, provides unprecedented op-
portunity to understand the molecular processes driving tumori-
genesis. Several existing approaches, such as PARADIGM
(Vaske et al., 2010), PARADIGM-SHIFT (Ng et al., 2012)
and network-based stratiﬁcation (NBS) (Hofree et al., 2013),
have been successfully developed to explore cancer-related path-
ways in individual samples. However, those approaches are
primarily based on overlaying multiple data types as evidence
(e.g. whole genome mutations, copy number variations,
mRNA changes) on existing biological networks, such as pro-
teiniprotein interaction networks. Therefore, the identiﬁed
cancer-related pathways are based on the known knowledge
about the networks. In addition, all these approaches are tied
to the gene-level resolution by augmenting the mutation profile
information onto the gene-based networks. However, somatic
point mutations occurred at different positions within a gene;
approaches limited to the gene level resolution will consider
them the same event regardless of their position difference.
This may be reasonable to tumor suppressors as nonsynonymous
mutations in different locations may disrupt the gene function in
a common manner. However, for those occurring in an oncogene
such as BRAF, they may differ with distinct functional conse-
quences. This is indicated by high frequency point mutations in
oncogenes that suggest a selective advantage of the speciﬁc point
mutation to confer cancer cell growth. To our knowledge, our
approach is among the ﬁrst attempts to overcome the challenge

to identify the functional consequences of a single driver
mutation.

In addition to helping understand the tumorigenesis, a speciﬁc
investigation of the downstream gene dysregulated by a driver
mutation could be very useful to the development of targeted
therapy strategies. Investigators are actively hunting for drugs
(especially kinase inhibitors) that can target speciﬁc driver mu-
tations. For example, FDA-approved drug Vemurafenib specif-
ically targets BRAF driver mutation at position V600
(BRAFV600), which occurs in ~50% of melanoma tumors.
This represents one of the most successful molecular therapy
strategies in melanoma, providing tremendous clinical benefit
in personalized cancer medicine. However, patients eventually
develop resistance after treatment (Lovly et al., 2012; Nazarian
et al., 2010). Therefore, an in-depth exploration of the functional
consequences of a driver mutation like BRAFV600 is critical for
better understanding the molecular proﬁles driven by a driver
mutation, and further development of appropriate molecular
therapy strategies.

Most tumors have three to eight driver mutations that target
on different pathways and multiple driver mutations may c0-
exist and confound. Although the Snowball approach is designed
to study the consequences associated with a single driver muta-
tion, it can be applied to samples with multiple driver mutations
to investigate their common and mutation-speciﬁc target genes
and pathways. However, in this case, users need to carefully
examine the mutation proﬁles and design meaningful compari-
son groups so that multiple driver mutations can be properly
contrasted and compared, and confounding effects minimized.
As an example, we demonstrated using TCGA melanoma me-
tastasis samples to analyze multiple driver mutations simultan-
eously with Snowball. First, we examined the mutational proﬁles
across all TCGA melanoma metastasis samples. Several high
frequency mutation genes including BRAF, NRAS and
CDKN2A have been observed (Fig. 5A). BRAF and NRAS ex-
hibited mutually exclusive pattern but partially confounded with
CDKN2A (Fig. 5A). Accordingly, we deﬁned 4 sample groups
each represent a gain-of-function, recurrent mutation in BRAF
and NRAS, a loss-of-function deletion in CDKN2A, or a control
group without any driver mutations. These four groups had 74
BRAF V600E, 17 NRAS Q61R, 12 CDKN2A LOSS and 80
driver mutation-free samples, respectively. Next, we applied
Snowball to compare each mutation group with the controls.
Figure 5B summarized the results. Interestingly, Snowball r0-
bustly identiﬁed a high proportion of genes that were shared
among all driver mutation groups, suggesting that these genes
might involve in the melanoma common pathways promoted by
all those driver mutations together. IPA analysis further revealed
that MITF is the most significantly enriched up-regulator of
those common genes. Previous studies reported that BRAF
and NRAS promote gene expression of MITF mediated via
MAPK pathway (Bollag et al., 2010; Garraway et al., 2005;
Nazarian et al., 2010; Wellbrock and Marais, 2005; Yokoyama
et al., 2011). In addition, Snowball also identiﬁed many driver
mutation-speciﬁc targets for future investigation.

In this study, we proposed Snowball, a new discovery ap-
proach, to identify the consequences of a driver mutation when
comparing the whole genome gene expression data between the
patient samples with and without a driver mutation. Snowball is

a de novo method that can robustly identify the target genes
dysregulated by a driver mutation. It showed high sensitivity
and speciﬁcity in our simulation studies and outperformed the
two commonly used methods when only a small sample size is
available and conventional methods do not have sufﬁcient de-
tection power. Good performance should indicate a reasonable
balance between type I and type II errors. As shown in
Supplementary Table S4, the type I error and detection rate
showed a reasonable trade-off from Snowball, but LIMMA
lacked the power to detect a good number of genes for down-
stream analyses in this case. Furthermore, the application of
Snowball approach to the TCGA data on the BRAF V600 mu-
tation in melanoma indicated its ability to discover functional,
highly relevant targets, including both novel and known genes.
The higher overlap with the BRAF V600 knockdown experiment
results additionally supported the conclusion that Snowball has
higher accuracy in identifying functional consequences caused by
this recurrent driver mutation. The functional analysis of the
gene lists obtained from Snowball, Random forests and
LIMMA indicates that Snowball performs substantially better
in identiﬁcation of functional gene and pathway targets of
driver mutations.

Snowball was developed to meet the speciﬁc challenges in
identifying the functional consequence of a driver mutation on
clinical samples. Although we believe our approach could be
applied to more general comparative experiments with replicates,
it has not been fully evaluated. We used the TCGA data in our
discovery example; however, the Snowball approach is not spe-
ciﬁcally designed for TCGA. It can be applied to any transcrip-
tome data in which two groups can be separated by the status of
a driver mutation. Based on our simulation study, Snowball is
particularly effective for cases with small sample size, and per-
form similarly as conventional methods when sample size is
large. Snowball is a computationally intensive method; however,
this becomes less of an issue, as the modern computational

power has substantially increased. The implemented R package
has applied the R parallel framework to simultaneously utilize
multiple processes that are now commonly available in lab
workstations.

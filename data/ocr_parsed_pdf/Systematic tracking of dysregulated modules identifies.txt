The correlation densities for tumor modules T are calculated similarly.

We identify the set F(8,T) of disrupted or altered module pairs by
modeling it as a maximum weight bipartite matching (Gabow, 1976) as
follows. We ﬁrst build a similarity graph M = (V, ,EM), where
VM 2 {8 U T}, and E, = U {(S,», T!) : J(S,», T1) 2 t1, A645,», T1) 2 6},
where J(S,», Tj) = |S,» ﬂ le/lS,» U le is the Jaccard similarity and
ALAS),  = |dw(S,») — dw(TJ-)| is the differential correlation density be-
tween S,- and T), and t, and 8 are thresholds. Every edge (5,», T1) is
weighted by J(S,»,Tj). We next identify the disrupted module pairs
F(8,T) by ﬁnding the maximum weight matching in M, and we rank
them in non-increasing order of their differential density A“.

Finally, we infer genes involved in cancer as O = {g : g e S,» U T],
(5,», T1) 6 F(8,T)} ranked in non-increasing order of ALAS), Tj).

To identify altered modules, we match normal and tumor modules by
setting a high t], which ensures that the module pairs either have the same
gene composition or have lost or gained only a few genes (e.g. if
|S,»| = 8, |Tj| :9, then t, =2/3 requires at least an overlap of 7).
Among these, the module pairs showing higher differential correlation
are ranked higher. Further, we expect cancer genes to be harbored within
these module pairs and rank them likewise.

2.4 Preparation of experimental data

We gathered Homo sapiens PPI data inferred from multiple low- and
high-throughput experiments deposited in Biogrid v3.1.93 (Stark et al.,
2011). To minimize false-positives, we used a scoring scheme, Iterative-
CD (Liu et al., 2009) with 40 iterations, to assign a reliability score to
every interaction in the PPI network. The score (between 0 and 1) reﬂects
the reliability of interactions by accounting for the number of common
neighbors shared among the proteins in each pair. Discarding low-scoring
interactions (<0.20) resulted in a PPI network of 29 600 interactions
among 5824 proteins (average node degree 10.165). We gathered 39
matched pairs (78 total) of normal and tumor gene expression samples
resected from 36 PDAC patients, from studies by Badea et al. (2008)
(NCBI GEO accession GSE15471). We gathered pancreatic mutation
proﬁles from the Supplementary Materials of Jones et al. (2008). These
authors identiﬁed four kinds of mutations, viz. somatic, homozygous
deletion, ampliﬁcation and driver mutations, of which genes with somatic
and driver mutations were assigned mutation scores (between 0 and 1)
that reﬂected the likelihood of these mutations in driving tumorigenesis.
We collated these scores and assigned a score of 1 to all deleted and
ampliﬁed genes to construct mutation proﬁles for 1169 genes in pancre-
atic cancer.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Experimental settings and initial validations

We ﬁrst tested our module—extraction procedure on the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPI network, as the available ‘gold
standard’ set of complexes in yeast is reasonably complete and
well—deﬁned. After testing a range of parameters, setting k=4,
to = 0.50 and tm = 0.25 resulted in the best recall (sensitivity) of
72% and precision (specificity) of 83% and a Gene Ontology—
based functional coherence of 76% for the modules. Therefore,
we maintained these settings for our experiments. We also note
that by relaxing the parameters to to = 1/3 and tm = 1/ 10, the
functional coherence was maintained at 61%, indicating the

modules corresponded to larger complex—groups and pathways
(details in Supplementary Files).

3.2 Analyzing disruptions in tumor PPI network

The normal H N and tumor H T networks displayed roughly equal
numbers of interactions, as well as average scores (weights%
27 277 and 27 266 interactions with average scores of 0.208 and
0.210, respectively. Figure 3a shows no signiﬁcant differences in
the score distributions of the two networks (Kolmogorovi
Smirnov test: DNT = 0.1556<Ka:0‘05 = 1.36). However, examin—
ing these interactions more carefully, we found 3746 interactions
that showed changes in scores. Of these, we extracted those with
score changes 3 0.10, which included 176 interactions showing
decrease (weakening) and 135 interactions showing increase
(strengthening) of scores from normal to tumor. Similar analysis
using expression correlations (Fig. 3b) identified ~8700 inter—
actions showing lower correlations and ~2100 interactions
showing higher correlations in tumor than normal
(KolmogoroviSmirnov test: DNT = 23.11 >Ka=rm5 = 1.36).

DAVID—based (Dennis et al., 2003) functional analysis of
genes involved in these 311 (2 176+ 135) interactions showed
significant enrichment (P<10_20) for the following biological
process terms: mitotic cell cycle, cell division, DNA repair, chro—
matin modiﬁcation, anaphase—promoting complex—dependent
mechanisms and ubiquitin—protein ligase activity during cell
cycle. We found key DNA damage repair (DDR) and cell
cycle players, including BRCAl (homologous recombination
during DDR), RAD21 (DDR and cell cycle), FANCA (part of
Fanconi anemia group, closely related to BRCAl—pathways),
INO80 (chromatin remodeling) and MCM2 (DNA replication)
involved in these interactions. The pair TGFBRl—TGFBR2,
showing an increase from 0.34 to 0.56, is involved in transform—
ing growth factor (TGF)—ﬂ signaling and is implicated in pancre—
atic cancer (Jones et al., 2008). RAD21, involved in at least four
of the rescored interactions, is a key player in DDR and has been
implicated in breast cancer (Yan et al., 2012).

3.3 Analyzing disruptions in tumor modules

We next performed a comparative analysis of normal 8 and
tumor T modules to understand disruptions at the module
level. Overall we noticed that the total number of modules, as
well as average modules sizes, were almost the same across the
two conditions (Table 1). The reason is that the interaction
scores were roughly the same (Fig. 3a), resulting in similar
module generation in both conditions.

But Table 1 also shows an overall decrease in correlation in
tumor modules, which was not entirely unexpected given our
analysis in Section 1.1. Further, this decrease had affected
mainly the highly correlated modules (Fig. 4). In particular,
there was a reduction in 45 (of 66) modules with correlation
3 0.4 from normal to tumor. DAVID—based analysis of these
45 modules (Fig. 5) showed signiﬁcant enrichment (P<10_03)
for core signaling pathways, including KRAS signaling, TGF—
ﬂ—signaling, Wnt—signaling, P53—apoptosis, cell cycle and DNA
repair; these pathways are genetically altered in 80% of pancre—
atic tumors (Jones et al., 2008).

Next, we computed the set of matching modules 1"(S,T),
giving |l"(S,T)| = 452, for t, = 0.67 and 6 = 0.10. We further

replaced existing genes, forming physical interactions with the
remaining ones in these modules in tumor. For example, the
normal module (HDAC2, HDACl, MTA2, MTAl, CHD4
and BCLl 1B) had changed to (HDAC2, HDACl, MTA2,
MTAl, CHD4, SIN3A and SOX2) in tumor with BCLllB
replaced by SIN3A and SOX2, and the module correlation had
increased by 0.137. SOX2 regulates transcriptional network of
oncogenes (Chen et al., 2012) and is implicated in small—cell lung
cancer (Chen et al., 2012; Rudin et al., 2012); SIN3A is a tran—
scriptional repressor implicated in breast cancer (Ellison—Zelski
and Alarid, 2010), whereas BCLllB is involved in lymphoid
malignancies (Satterwhite et al., 2001). We hypothesize that
these gene—swapping events in modules were indicative of
tumor disruptions; therefore, they are relevant to understand
cancer.

In our computational model, modules change gene compos—
itions only when the ranking of constituting cliques changes,
resulting in altered clique—merging between conditions (Section
2.2). The cliques are re—ranked only when their constituting inter—
actions are rescored. A total of 311 interactions were re—scored
between normal and tumor (Section 3.2), and these constituted
53 cliques (of sizes 577) of the total ~5470 cliques present in each
network. The jumps in ranks (average 4) noticed for these 53
cliques were higher than the jumps (average 1) noticed for the
remaining cliques. These 53 cliques contributed to modules that
showed changes in gene compositions.

DAVID—based functional analysis of the 311 rescored inter—
actions showed significant (P<10_20) enrichment for key
genome—stability mechanisms, including DDR and cell cycle (re—
visit Section 3.2). The 21 altered modules showed signiﬁcant
(P<10_66) enrichment for these mechanisms, and also for the
following Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathways (P<10_03): cell cycle, DNA replication, Wnt—sig—
naling, TGF—ﬂ signaling and P53—based apoptosis, all of which
have been implicated in the Jones et al. (2008) study on pancre—
atic cancer. In addition to this, of the 31 genes that had swapped,
six (TP53, KRAS, SFN, SMAD4, CDKN2A and ARIDlA) are
implicated in pancreatic cancer, and 19 are included in KEGG
pathways in cancer (Supplementary Files). These observations
provide evidence that the gene—swapping events in our model
are strongly indicative of genes and modules relevant to cancer.

We next describe an example of a gene—swapping event to aid
interpret its relevance to cancer mechanisms. Figure 6 shows a
normal—tumor module pair in which FAM175B was replaced by
TP53. This was the consequence of a weakened FAM175B—
clique displaced in ranking by a strengthened TP53 clique. It is
known that the expression level of TP53 is low in normal cells,
whereas DNA damage triggers increase in TP53 expression,
which is responsible for activating transcription of DNA repair
proteins. FAM175B is a member of the BRISC complex, respon—
sible for recruitment of BRCAliBARDl heterodimer to sites of
DNA damage at double—strand breaks. We noticed the TP53—
expression level had increased from 5.86 (normal) to 6.56
(tumor) (Table 3), and the correlation of the module (RAD51,
BRCAl, TP53, SUMOl and UBC) had increased from 0.123
(normal) to 0.352 (tumor). This indicated activation of DNA
repair proteins, RAD51 and BRCA1 in the presence of TP53,
which are components of the homologous recombination
double—strand break repair pathway. The correlation of the
module (FAM175B, BRCC3, BRE and BARDl), which repre—
sented the BRISC complex, had reduced from 0.381 (normal) to
0.144 (tumor). This indicated possible impairment of DDR
mechanisms observed in cancer cells.

3.5 Evaluating predicted genes in PDAC

3.5.] Evaluation against ‘gold standard’ We evaluated our pre—
dicted genes against three gold standard (benchmark) lists for
pancreatic cancer, namely, OMIM (pancreatic #260350)
(Hamosh et al., 2004), COSMIC Classic (Bamford et al., 2004)
and the Jones et al. (2008) study. We gathered our predicted
genes from module pairs showing differential correlation
3 0.10, giving 143 genes.

We calculated recall (sensitivity) values as the fraction of
benchmark genes covered by the top R—predicted genes. When
R: 143 (taking all predicted genes), the recall values were
OMIM: 78% (7/9), COSMIC: 67% (12/18) and Jones: 43%
(37/86) (Fig. 7a). When R = 25, the recall values were OMIM:
78% (7/9), COSMIC: 55% (10/18) and Jones: 19% (16/86). The
top 7 genes (R = 7) belonged to all the three benchmarks. Finally,
five of our predicted genes, coding for transcription factors JUN,
SMAD3, CEBPA, FOS and STAT3, were conﬁrmed recently as
biomarkers in PDAC (Winter et al., 2012).

3.5.2 Assessment using differential expression of genes There
were 2559 differentially expressed genes in the PPI network
(adjusted P <0.001) of which 1362 (or 53.23%) belonged to at
least one module. The top three—enriched terms for these 1362
genes were the biological processes (P<10_20): cell cycle, DNA
repair and chromatin modiﬁcation, and the KEGG pathways
(P<10_03): KRAS signaling, Wnt—signaling and P53—based
apoptosis; these processes and pathways are genetically altered
in at least 80% of pancreatic tumors (Jones et al., 2008). The top
three enriched terms for the remaining 1197 differentially ex—
pressed genes were the biological processes (P< 10‘10): cytoskel—
eton organization, actin filament—based process and intracellular
transport, and the KEGG pathways (P<10_03): regulation of
actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion and endocytosis; these are rele—
vant to cancer cell migration and metastasis (Yamaguchi and
Condeelis, 2007). These genes were failed to be drawn into

noted for overexpression in pancreatic cancer. Mahajan et al.
(2008) note possible involvement of NCOA6 in breast, colon
and lung cancers.

4 CONCLUSION

Modules including complexes and pathways work in additive,
compensatory and alternative ways to counter genome destabi—
lizing agents. Cancer is an outcome of coordinated dysfunction—
ing of these very modules; therefore, countering it necessitates an
even more coordinated and systematic approach. The consider—
able differences in module behavior between normal and cancer
and even between two sub—types of the same cancer depict the
complexity and speciﬁcity of roles that genes undertake in these
conditions. In this context, the point highlighted in Section 1, viz.

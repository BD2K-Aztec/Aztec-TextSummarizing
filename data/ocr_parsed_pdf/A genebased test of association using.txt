ABSTRACT

Motivation: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) measures the
association between two sets of multidimensional variables. We
reasoned that CCA could provide an efficient and powerful approach
for both univariate and multivariate gene-based tests of association
without the need for permutation testing.

Results: Compared with a commonly used permutation-based
approach, CCA (i) is faster; (ii) has appropriate type-l error rate
for normally distributed quantitative traits; (iii) provides comparable
power for small to medium-sized genes (<100 kb); (iv) provides
greater power when the causal variants are uncommon; (v) provides
considerably less power for larger genes (3100 kb) when the causal
variants have a broad minor allele frequency (MAF) spectrum.
Application to a GWAS of leukocyte levels identified SAFB and
a histone gene cluster as novel putative loci harboring multiple
independent variants regulating lymphocyte and neutrophil counts.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the past few years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs)
have been successful in uncovering common genetic variants
underlying complex traits or diseases. Considerable efforts have
been made to replicate the most associated marker in a given GWAS
locus, but there is growing evidence that some loci harbor additional
independently associated variants (Moffatt et (11., 2010; Saccone
et (11., 2010; Silverberg et (11., 2009; Zheng et (11., 2007). This
phenomenon, which may be widespread, can be explored through
gene-based association methods (Neale and Sham, 2004) to facilitate
the identiﬁcation of genes with multiple risk variants with weak
effects.

Current gene-based methods typically require permutation or
simulation testing to account for the correlation between SNPs as
well as gene size, among which VEGAS (Liu et (11., 2010) and
PLINK set-based tests (Purcell et (11., 2007) are most frequently
employed. Both tests combine results from single-SNP analyses but
differ in how an appropriate null distribution is obtained. VEGAS
relies on simulations of linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure from

a reference dataset, such as the HapMap, whereas PLINK set-
based tests resort to permutation testing. In general, these are
ﬂexible approaches that can accommodate many different analytical
strategies, but can be computationally intensive with increasing
number of SNPs tested and when the level of signiﬁcance is high.
Previously, Ferreira and Purcell (2009) proposed a multivariate
test of association based on canonical correlation analysis
(CCA) to simultaneously test the association between a single
SNP and multiple phenotypes. CCA, ﬁrst described by Harold
Hotelling (1936), measures the association between two sets of
multidimensional variables by maximizing the correlation between
their linear combinations. We reasoned that CCA could also
provide an efﬁcient and powerful approach for a gene-based test
of association by intrinsically taking into account the correlation
structure between SNPs without the need for permutation testing.
Therefore, in the present study, we extended the CCA approach
to test multiple SNPs for association with a single or multiple
phenotypes measured in unrelated individuals and compared its
performance with permutation-based tests of association.

2 METHODS

2.1 Canonical Correlation Analysis

CCA provides a convenient statistical framework to simultaneously test the
association between any number of quantitative phenotypes (p. phenotype-
set) and any number of SNPs (q. SNP-set) genotyped across a gene or region
of interest in unrelated individuals. The test is equivalent to (i) univariate
linear regression when p = q = 1 (single trait versus single SNP) and standard
multiple regression when (ii) [721 and q> 1 (single trait versus multiple
SNPs) or (iii) p> 1 and (1:1 (multiple traits versus single SNP. considered
by Ferreira and Purcell (2009)). When (iv) p> 1 and q > 1 (multiple traits
versus multiple SNPs). this approach represents a multivariate gene-based
test of association. In this study. we were speciﬁcally interested in testing
the performance of CCA approach for the gene-based scenarios (ii) and (iv).

To implement the CCA test. each SNP in the target region is ﬁrst
coded according to the allelic dosage (0. 1 and 2). Next. to remove any
multicollinearity between SNPs. we perform a two-stage LD pruning step:
ﬁrst. we remove SNPs that are in high pairwise LD (r2 >08) with other
markers; second. to identify and remove high correlations between linear
combinations of SNPs. we use variance inﬂation factor (VIF) analysis to
iteratively exclude individual SNPs that have a VIP > 2 with other markers.
When p> 1. the same pruning procedure is applied to the phenotype-set to
remove any strongly correlated phenotypes from the analysis. We tested
different LD and VIP thresholds but found that 0.8 and 2. respectively.
resulted in appropriate type-I error and optimal power.

Finally. for a sample of n unrelated individuals with data for q SNPs and
p phenotypes. the j: min(q.p) canonical correlations p]- are then calculated
as the square root of the j eigenvalues of the canonical correlation matrix.

Missing SNP genotype data can be imputed using dedicated software and
appropriate reference panels (e.g. HapMap). Missing phenotype data are
handled either by case-wise deletion (if data are missing above a pre-deﬁned
per-individual missingness threshold) or mean imputation (i.e. a missing
phenotype is replaced by the sample mean).

2.2 Coalescent-based simulation of SNP data

To test the performance of CCA. we simulated SNP data for a hypothetical
gene with the coalescent-based simulator GENOME (Liang et al.. 2007).
We assumed a mutation rate of 10‘8 per generation per base pair and an
effective population size of 10 000. A study population of 2000 individuals
was formed by (i) simulating 1000 haplotypes; (ii) pairing these to form a
pool of 500 diploid genomes; and (iii) randomly drawing with replacement
2000 diploid genomes from that pool. SNPs with a minor allele frequency
(MAF) < 0.01 were excluded from analysis. For some of the models tested
(see below). the simulated gene included multiple independent SNPs (or
k. with k> 1) contributing to phenotypic variation. To achieve this. k-1
recombination hotspots were created by simulating SNP data for k regions
independently. which were then appended to form the complete gene.

2.3 Gene-based analysis of a single quantitative trait

There is growing demand for powerful and efﬁcient single-trait gene-based
tests of association. We performed extensive simulations to assess the
performance of CCA when used to test the association between a single
quantitative trait and multiple SNPs. As mentioned above. in this case CCA
is equivalent to standard multiple regression. After generating SNP data for
2000 individuals. we simulated a normally distributed quantitative trait under
arange of models to test the impact of ﬁve factors. which are described below.

2.3.] Proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the gene SNP data
were simulated for a 50 kb gene. with three independent regions separated
by two recombination hotspots. A single SNP was randomly selected from
each region and considered a causal variant (or quantitative trait locus.
QTL); a normally distributed phenotype was then simulated with the three
QTL contributing equally and additively to its total variance. The total
contribution across the three QTL to the phenotypic variance (or gene
heritability. 112) ranged between 0.6% and 1.8%. To assess type-I error rate.
112 was ﬁxed at 0%.

2.3.2 Number of independent QTL In these models. we varied the number
of independent QTL (k) in the gene from 3 to 7. while ﬁxing gene length
at 50 kb and 112 at 0.9%. Each QTL contributed equally and additively to 112
and so for models with a larger k. each individual QTL had a smaller effect
on the trait. For example. for a gene with ﬁve QTL and 112 = 0.9%. each QTL
individually explained 0.18% (0.9/5) of the phenotypic variance.

2.3.3 Gene length We simulated data for ﬁve gene lengths: 20. 25. 50.
100 and 500 kb. We set k: 5 and 112: 0.9%.

2.3.4 QTL allele frequency Instead of randomly selecting SNPs to be
treated as QTL. in these analyses we imposed a MAP constraint such that
only SNPs with a MAP within a narrow range (175%. 5710%. 1&20% 0r
2&50%) were selected as QTL. We also varied gene length from 20 to
500 kb. but kept k=5 and h2 =0.9%.

2.3.5 Allele frequency of SNPs included for analysis Lastly. in addition
to controlling the MAP of the simulated QTL. we also restricted the MAP
of the SNPs included for analysis within two ranges. uncommon (175%)
and relatively common (2&50%) SNPs. In these analyses. gene length was
50kb, k=5 and h2=0.9%.

For each model. 1000 simulations (25000 for type-I error rate) were
performed. Power (or type-I error rate) was then estimated as the proportion
of simulations with a P-Value signiﬁcant for 0120.01 (unless otherwise
noted). The performance of the CCA test was compared against two standard
permutation-based strategies implemented in PLINK (Purcell et al.. 2007).
One such strategy tests each SNP in a gene for association with the
phenotype. computes the average chi-square statistic across all SNPs. and
then assesses its signiﬁcance through permutationiwe refer to this as the
‘all-SNP test”. Alternatively. the ‘best-SNP test” considers only the maximum
chi-square statistic across all SNPs tested and determines its signiﬁcance
through permutation. We also analyzed each simulated dataset with GWiS
(Huang et al.. 2011). which uses greedy Bayesian model selection to identify
independent effects within a gene and estimates overall signiﬁcance through
permutation. We used the default GWiS analysis parameters except the
maximum number of permutations (set to 1000). Both PLINK tests and
GWiS were conducted on the full dataset. i.e. prior to the pruning step.

2.4 Gene-based analysis of multiple quantitative traits

To explore the performance of CCA as a multi-phenotype gene-based test
of association. we simulated SNP data for a 60 kb gene with k=3 and
112 = 0.9%. as described above. Next. we simulated ﬁve normally distributed
traits under ﬁve models. In Model 1. each of the three independent QTL
individually explained 0.3% (0.9/3) of the variance of trait 1. i.e. the QTL
had no impact on the variance of the other four traits. In Models 275. the
three QTL contributed to the variance of a progressively larger number of
traits: 2. 3. 4 and all 5 traits. respectively. In all ﬁve models. shared sources
of variation between traits other than the QTL were also simulated so that
the residual phenotypic correlation between pairs of traits was ~0.4. We
also considered a null model with h2=0% to assess type-I error rate. We
compared the power of the CCA test with a permutation-based approach
that estimates the empirical signiﬁcance of the average chi-square statistic
obtained when testing all SNPs for association with all traits.

2.5 Gene-based analysis of a single disease trait

We also investigated if CCA could provide a valid gene-based test for the
analysis of a single disease trait. For this purpose. we assumed a liability-
threshold model and ﬁrst simulated SNP data and a normally distributed trait
as described above for 2000 individuals. assuming a disease prevalence of
1. 5 or 10%. For a disease prevalence d . individuals with a trait value above
Q(d) [e.g. for d 20.05. Q(0.05)= 1.64] were considered as cases. and as
controls otherwise. The CCA test was then applied as described above. In
these analyses. gene length was 50 kb. k = 5 and 112 20.9%. Type-I error rate
was assessed by setting 112 20%.

2.6 Application to a GWAS of white blood cell traits

To illustrate the applicability of CCA as a gene-based test of association.
we considered six white blood cell (WBC) traits measured in 1061
unrelated individuals of European ancestry. including total WBC. neutrophil.
lymphocyte. monocyte. eosinophil and basophil counts. This dataset is a

subset of the family-based Australian cohort analyzed by Ferreira et al.
(2009). Each trait was normalized and adjusted for age and sex effects
prior to the analysis. Univariate outlier observations (6 SD above the mean)
were excluded from analysis. Data were available for 2.3 million autosomal
SNPs with MAF > 1%, including directly genotyped (obtained with Illumina
610 K arrays) and imputed (based on HapMap 2) SNPs. We tested each
individual trait (univariate gene-based analyses) or all traits simultaneously
(multivariate gene-based analysis) for association with 17470 genes. Gene
boundaries were deﬁned by considering the start and end of the largest
isoform for each gene according to the annotation in the UCSC Genome
Browser (hg18, NCBI build 36). We added a 15 kb buffer upstream and
downstream as most cis regulatory variants fall within 15 kb of the respective
gene (Pickrell et al., 2010).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulation approach

To test the performance of CCA as a gene-based test of association,
we simulated SNP data for 2000 individuals under a coalescent
model and restricted our analyses to SNPs with a MAF; 1%
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Data were simulated for a hypothetical
gene ranging in length from 20 kb (with 17 SNPs on average) to
500kb (average of 463 SNPs). A single or multiple SNPs in the
gene were then selected randomly as causal variants (i.e. QTL)
and a normally distributed trait simulated for a range of models
as described in the ‘Methods’ section.

3.2 Gene-based analysis of a single quantitative trait

We studied in detail the performance of CCA when applied to
test the association between a single normally distributed trait and
multiple SNPs. The type-I error rate of the CCA test was Close to
the expected nominal levels, irrespectively of gene size and LD
pattern (Supplementary Table S1). Next, we compared the power
of CCA with three permutation-based approaches: the ﬁrst two
are implemented in PLINK, and are based on the signiﬁcance
of the average (all-SNP test) or best (best-SNP test) Chi-square
statistic across all available SNPs. The third uses greedy Bayesian

model selection to identify independent effects within a gene and
is implemented in GWiS (Huang et al., 2011). We tested ﬁve
different factors that were likely to affect the power of the CCA
test: (i) proportion of the phenotypic variance explained by the gene;
(ii) number of independent QTL; (iii) gene length; (iv) QTL allele
frequency; and (v) allele frequency of SNPs included for analysis.

3.2.1 Proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the gene
(hz) We simulated data for a 50 kb gene with three independent
QTL and varied h2 from 0.6% to 1.8%. All four tests provided
comparable power, which improved with increasing effect size
(Fig. 1A).

3.2.2 Number of independent QTL ( k) As expected, increasing
the number of independent QTL—while maintaining h2 constant—
led to a steady power loss for the best-SNP test (Fig. 1B), which only
takes into account the result for the most associated SNP in the gene.
Similar results were obtained with GWiS. In contrast, the power
of the CCA and all-SNP approaches was comparable and largely
unaffected by the number of independent QTL.

3.2.3 Gene length (l) Permutation- or simulation-based methods
can become computationally intensive for large genes with hundreds
of SNPs genotyped (see Supplementary Table S2 for a comparison
of running times). A test that is both efﬁcient and powerﬁil even
when analyzing large genes is therefore desirable and so next we
investigated the impact of gene size on the performance of the CCA
test. For smaller genes (<50kb), the power of the CCA and all-
SNP tests was comparable, and both outperformed the best-SNP and
GWiS tests (Fig. 1C). However, the power of the CCA test decreased
rapidly with increasing gene size, becoming comparatively less
powerﬁil then the all-SNP test for large genes (2 100 kb). The
power of the all-SNP, best-SNP and GWiS tests also decreased with
increasing gene size, but less markedly.

3.2.4 QTL allele frequency We also assessed the impact of the
QTL MAF on the power of the CCA test. Power was comparable

between models with exclusively uncommon (1—5% MAF) or
relatively common (20—50% MAF) QTL (Fig. 2). Similar results
were obtained with the best-SNP and GWiS tests. In contrast, the
power of the all-SNP test decreased with decreasing MAF of the
underlying QTL. As a result, CCA provided a more powerful gene-
based test of association across a range of gene lengths when the
QTL were uncommon. Similar power levels were observed for the
CCA test for rarer QTL (0.1—1% MAF, Supplementary Table S3).

3.2.5 Allele frequency of SNPs included for analysis Lastly, we
determined the power of CCA as a ﬁinCtion of both the MAF of the
QTL and the MAF of the SNPs included for analysis. We reasoned
that different analytical strategies may be required depending on the
assumed underlying genetic model and, hence, the hypothesis being
tested. As expected, when a gene harbored exclusively multiple
independent common QTL (20—50% MAF), power of the CCA
test was maximized by analyzing only similarly common SNPs
(20—50% MAF, Supplementary Fig. S2A). Conversely, for genes
with multiple independent uncommon QTL (1—5% MAF), power
increased by excluding from the analysis all common SNPs in the
gene (Supplementary Fig. S2B). When there was a mixture of both
common and uncommon QTL in the gene, it was not efﬁcient to
ﬁlter out SNPs from the analysis based on MAF (Supplementary
Fig. S3).

3.3 Gene-based analysis of multiple quantitative traits

CCA provides a useful framework to simultaneously measure the
association between multiple SNPs and multiple traits in a single
test and so we were interested in determining how well it would
perform when compared to a permutation-based approach. When

the three independent QTL simulated in a 60 kb gene inﬂuenced
the variation of only a subset of the ﬁve simulated traits, the CCA
test provided improved power when compared with the average Chi-
square test (Supplementary Fig. S4). However, power of the CCA
test was considerably lower when the three QTL inﬂuenced all ﬁve
traits, an observation that is consistent with previous reports (Allison
et al., 1998; Amos et al., 2001; Evans and Duffy, 2004; Ferreira and
Purcell, 2009).

3.4 Gene-based analysis of a single disease trait

Many GWASs focus on complex diseases rather than quantitative
traits. Therefore, we were interested in investigating if CCA could
also provide a valid gene-based test when analyzing a single disease
trait. We simulated data for a 50 kb gene with ﬁve independent QTL
and a disease trait under a liability-threshold model, assuming a
disease prevalence of 1, 5 or 10%. The type-I error rate of the CCA
test was again Close to the expected nominal levels (Supplementary
Table S4). For a disease prevalence of 1%, power of the CCA was
comparable with that of the all-SNP test (Supplementary Table S5).
However, when we simulated data based on a higher disease
prevalence (i.e. lower SNP genotype relative risk), power was lower
for the CCA test when compared with the all-SNP test.

3.5 Application to a GWAS of WBC counts

We applied the CCA gene-based test to the analysis of six WBC
traits measured in 1061 unrelated individuals of European ancestry,
including total WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil
and basophil counts. We tested each individual trait (i.e. six
univariate gene-based analyses) and all traits simultaneously (i.e. a
single multivariate gene-based analysis) for association with 17 470
genes.

QQ plots for the six univariate gene-based analyses are provided
in Supplementary Fig. S5. No gene-based association exceeded a P:
4.8 X 10‘7, a conservative threshold that corrects for the analysis
of 17 470 genes and six traits. The most signiﬁcantly associated
genes (P < 5 X 10_6) are listed in Table 1, and included HISTIH4D
for total WBC (P: 1.4 X 10‘s) and neutrophil counts (P=3.0 ><
10_6); PI4K2A for total WBC (P =2.2>< 10_6) and lymphocyte
counts (P=4.1><10_6); and both CI900‘70 (P=7.8 ><10_7) and
SAFB (P: 7.4 X 10‘7) for lymphocyte counts.

Closer inspection of these results indicated that all six were driven
by at least two independent SNPs nominally associated with the
respective phenotype (Supplementary Table S6). For example, of
the 42 SNPs located in or within 15 kb of PI4K2A, six were retained
for the gene-based analysis after LD-pruning (all with r2 < 0.2 with
each other), of which four were nominally associated with total WBC
counts in single-SNP analyses: rs3890727 (P =0.0023, MAF =
31%), rs12245600 (P=0.0105, MAF =3%), rs11595249 (P:
0.0126, MAF =34%) and rs17418706 (P=0.0136, MAF = 13%).
Therefore, the region demarcated by this gene contains multiple
independent putative QTL for total WBC counts; individually, these
have unremarkable associations, but when analyzed jointly the
evidence for association with total WBC is considerably greater
(CCA gene-based P=2.2 X 10‘6).

We repeated the same six gene-based analyses but restricted these
to SNPs with MAF between 1% and 5%, or between 20% and 50%,
to search for genes with potential multiple independent uncommon
or common variants, respectively. QQ plots for these analyses are

these analyses provided stronger support (P < 4.8 X 10_7) for an
association between lymphocyte counts and the Chromosome 19

as well as between neutrophil counts and the histone 1 gene Cluster

Finally, the multivariate CCA gene-based analysis did not identify
any new region with a P < 2.8 X 10_6, which corrects for 17 470

10_6) and consistent, albeit weaker associations for HISTIH4D,
PI4K2A and CI900‘70 (Table 1).

4 DISCUSSION

We performed a series of simulations to test whether CCA could
provide a convenient, robust and powerﬁil statistical framework for
a gene-based test of association when analyzing a quantitative trait
measured in unrelated individuals. Our results suggest that, when
compared with a commonly used permutation-based approach that
considers all genetic variation assayed in a gene, a CCA gene-
based test (i) can be orders of magnitude faster, particularly for
larger, highly signiﬁcant genes; (ii) has appropriate type-I error
rate when analyzing a single normally distributed quantitative trait;
(iii) provides comparable power for small to medium-sized genes
(< 100 kb); (iv) provides greater power when the causal variants are
uncommon, irrespectively of gene size. On the other hand, the CCA
test was considerably less powerﬁil for larger genes (2 100 kb) when
the causal variants have a broad MAF spectrum or are relatively
common (MAF > 20%). Of note, 22% of the 17 470 genes tested in
the WBCs study were larger than 100kb, which included a :l: 15 kb
buffer.

We further show that including in the CCA gene-based test all
genetic variation assayed in a given gene can be counterproductive
when the speciﬁc aim of the analysis is to identify genes that harbor
exclusively uncommon or common causal variants, but not both.
Based on these intuitive results, we suggest that CCA may provide

a particularly useﬁil gene-based approach for the separate analysis
of either uncommon or common variants.

Gene-based association P-values are often used as input for
pathway-based association analyses. In this case, CCA may not be
the most appropriate test to use because of the large impact of gene
size on power. Gene-based methods that have a more comparable
performance across different gene lengths (e.g. all-SNP or GWiS
tests) may provide a better alternative to ensure that an association
with pathways composed of large genes can be as readily detected
as with those composed of smaller genes.

Our results suggest that CCA also provides a valid test for the
analysis of a single disease trait or multiple quantitative traits. In
this case, however, CCA provided little if any gain in power when
compared to the all-SNP permutation-based approach. The CCA
gene-based test nonetheless provides a computationally efﬁcient
alternative when analyzing such traits. In the multivariate scenario,
a signiﬁcant result can be followed by (i) an examination of
the weights attributed by the CCA to each phenotype; and/or
(ii) inspection of the univariate gene-based results. In this way,
the individual traits underlying the multivariate association can be
identiﬁed.

As proof-of-principle, we applied the CCA gene-based test to the
analysis of six WBC traits measured in up to 1061 unrelated healthy
individuals. Univariate gene-based analyses of both common and
uncommon SNPs identiﬁed two notable regions of association, one
for lymphocyte counts on Chromosome 19 that included the two
paralog genes SAFB and SAFBZ, and another for neutrophil counts
including several genes in the histone 1 Cluster on Chromosome 6.
SAFB is involved in the transcription repression of immune
regulatory genes, including HIA and cytokine genes (Hammerich-
Hille et al., 2010). Furthermore, SAFB_/_ knockout mice show
defects in the development of the hematopoietic system, increased
WBC counts, hypoplasia of the thymus and increased signs of
infections (Garee and Oesterreich, 2010). Thus, together with these
data, our results suggest that SAFB and/or SAFBZ represent novel
putative genes with multiple independent QTL regulating variation
in lymphocyte counts in humans. Our analyses identiﬁed two
speciﬁc uncommon variants (rs4239608 and rs806706) in this region
that could be the focus of subsequent follow-up studies.

The second notable region was the histone 1 gene Cluster on
Chromosome 6, which was associated with neutrophil counts.
Histones are increasingly recognized to have an important role in
cellular signaling and innate immunity, in addition to their role in
the regulation of Chromatin structure (Parseghian and Luhrs, 2006).
Interestingly, mice Challenged with a sublethal dose of histones,
develop a prominent accumulation of neutrophils in the lung (Xu
et al., 2009). Furthermore, the histone 1 gene Cluster contains
the greatest enrichment of SAFB target-binding sites (Hammerich-
Hille et al., 2010). These results thus raise the possibility that
genetic variants in this region may affect the binding of SAFB
which, in turn, may regulate the transcription of key histone
genes involved in neutrophil production, migration or apoptosis.
Candidate SNPs that may explain this effect include rs4145878,
rs17598658 and rs4593350; further studies that attempt to replicate
our observed association between these and neutrophil counts are
warranted.

In conclusion, we show that CCA provides a useﬁil framework
for a gene-based test of association which, in some situations, may
outperform commonly used permutation-based approaches. Our

neutrophil counts, but these need to be conﬁrmed by follow-up
studies.

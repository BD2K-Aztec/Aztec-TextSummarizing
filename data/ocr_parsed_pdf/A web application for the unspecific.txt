Abstract

Genomic technologies allow laboratories to produce large—scale data sets, either through the use
of next—generation sequencing or microarray platforms. To explore these data sets and obtain max—
imum value from the data, researchers view their results alongside all the known features of a
given reference genome. To study transcriptional changes that occur under a given condition, re—
searchers search for regions of the genome that are differentially expressed between different ex—
perimental conditions. In order to identify these regions several algorithms have been developed
over the years, along with some bioinformatic platforms that enable their use. However, currently
available applications for comparative microarray analysis exclusively focus on changes in gene
expression within known transcribed regions of predicted protein—coding genes, the changes that
occur in non—predictable genetic elements, such as non—coding RNAs. Here, we present a web ap—
plication for the visualization of strand—specific tiling microarray or next—generation sequencing
data that allows customized detection of differentially expressed regions all along the genome in
an unspecific manner, that allows identification of all RNA sequences, predictable or not.

1 Introduction

Eukaryotic genomes are composed by coding and non-coding DNA
sequences. Until recently it was thought that most coding regions
had been identified, as they encode either protein-coding genes,
highly conserved ribosomal RNA, transference RNA or other minor
non-coding RNA (ncRNA) species which open reading frames
(ORF) are relatively easy to find (Brent, 2007). Only 5’ and 3’ ex-
tended transcribed regions outside the ORF and some introns were
not easily predictable (Bahrami—Samani et (11., 2014; Machado—Lima
et (11., 2008). During the last years, however, evidence from different

sources has made clear that most of the assumed ‘non-coding’ DNA
was, in fact, encoding non-predictable RNA molecules. These non-
coding sequences have proven not only to be expressed, but also to
play many different regulatory roles within the cell (Mattick and
Makunin, 2006).

Current genome-wide methods, such as tiling microarrays and
next generation sequencing (NGS) provide platforms for the study
of transcriptomes. In most cases, transcriptomic analyses are per-
formed to compare relative RNA abundance in different samples,
such as wild type versus mutant or before versus after stress

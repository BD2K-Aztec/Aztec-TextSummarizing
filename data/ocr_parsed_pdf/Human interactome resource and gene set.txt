Human interactome resource and gene set linkage analysis

 

interactome, the density of inter—gene—set interactions will be able
to indicate the overall strength of the functional linkage between
two gene sets. The idea of exploring interaction density for func—
tional inference has been discussed previously (Asur et al., 2007;
Bader and Hogue, 2003; Brun et al., 2004). Based on the cover—
age and reliability of HIR, we designed a pair of tests that val—
idate both the ‘strength’ and the ‘biological significance’ of the
observed inter—gene—set interaction density to detect substantial
functional linkage at the gene set level.

In the following sections, we provide a description of our
method for obtaining a largely homogenous functional interac—
tome HIR and the details of our GSLA approach. The quality
of HIR and the utility of GSLA were evaluated in a series of
systematic evaluations and case studies.

2 RESULTS
2.1 Method for constructing a homogenous functional
interactome

GSLA relies on a simple strategy that considers the density of
inter—gene—set interactions as the measure of the overall strength
of the functional linkage between two gene sets. For this simple
strategy to work, the underlining functional interactome needs to
be homogenous, i.e. consist of functional interactions that are of
similar strength and represent an unbiased sample of the true
functional interactome. Obtaining a homogenous functional
interactome is challenging because ‘functional interaction’ is an
umbrella term, that describes diverse types of biological mech—
anisms that connect the functions of two genes. These diverse
types of biological mechanisms are exhibited in diverse types of
data. Functional interactions suggested by only one type of data
are often unable to represent an unbiased sample of the complete
functional interactome.

For example, a protein interaction network is a type of func—
tional interactome in which functional interactions are suggested
by only one type of dataiphysical protein interactions. The
structure of protein interaction networks has been extensively
studied (Bu et al., 2003; Han et al., 2004). In a typical protein
interaction network, there are clusters of densely interconnected
genes, which are called modules (Han et al., 2004). Network
modules often encode cellular processes (or functions). There
are bridge proteins that connect two modules and mediate the
ﬂow of information between the modules. Therefore, bridges are
effective regulators of modules (Yu et al., 2007). For example,
bridges were found to be effective drug targets (Hwang et al.,
2008; Nguyen and Jordan, 2010; Nguyen et al., 2011), and
unique bridges (bottlenecks) were found to be preferential targets
of regulatory microRNAs (Wang et al., 2011). The fact that
bridges are effective module regulators indicates that bridges
have strong functional interactions with the proteins in the mod—
ules that they regulate. In the true functional interactome, many
functional interactions are expected between the bridges and pro—
teins in the modules that the bridges regulate. However, in a
protein interaction network, by deﬁnition, bridges interact with
only a few proteins in the modules that the bridges regulate;
proteins that interact extensively with module members are con—
sidered to be module members rather than bridges. In fact, many
bridges that connect two modules have only two interactions,

one interaction with each module. Therefore, the many func—
tional interactions between the bridges and proteins in the mod—
ules that the bridges regulate are underrepresented in a protein
interaction network. This arrangement means that in a protein
interaction network, the number of interactions between a bridge
protein and proteins constituting a bridge—regulated module does
not reﬂect the strength of the functional linkage between this
bridge protein and the cellular process (or function) that is
encoded by the module. Accordingly, the simple strategy of
GSLA that uses inter—gene—set interaction density to measure
the overall strength of the functional linkage between two gene
sets will not work well if bridge proteins are involved in the gene
sets.

One approach to constructing a homogenous functional inter—
actome is to integrate multiple types of data that suggest func—
tional interactions between genes. For example, the functional
interactions between the bridge proteins and the proteins in the
modules that the bridges regulate, which are underrepresented in
protein interaction networks, could be revealed in co—expression
networks or co—evolution networks. However, integrating mul—
tiple types of data is not straightforward because we do not
currently have an intuitive or established way to consistently
and rigorously measure the ‘strength’ of the functional inter—
action suggested by multiple types of data. Therefore, we took
a rather rough approach to measuring the ‘strength’ of a func—
tional interaction. We assume that the strengths of the functional
interactions between the genes that encode physically interacting
proteins were approximately at the same level. Therefore, we
used a statistical learning approach to identify pairs of genes
that are most similar to the pairs of genes that encode physically
interacting proteins, with respect to multiple types of data that
suggest functional interaction. In this manner, we integrated mul—
tiple types of data to infer the functional interactions between
genes, which were expected to represent the true functional inter—
actome in a more unbiased manner. At the same time, these
inferred functional interactions were of similar strengths, approx—
imating the strengths of functional interactions between genes
that encode physically interacting proteins.

Technically, this approach was similar to predicting physical
protein interactions based on evidence of functional association,
which has been previously explored for validating interactions
using unreliable high—throughput experiments (Giot et al., 2003)
or directly predicting novel protein interactions (Basso et al.,
2005). However, in our methodological framework, this
approach was used for a different purpose: implementing a con—
sistent (although not rigorous) measure of the ‘strength of func—
tional interaction’ between two genes when functional
interactions were suggested by multiple types of data.

The workﬂow of our interaction inference procedure is out—
lined in Figure 1 and is detailed in the Supplemental Material. To
train an inference model, a gold—standard example dataset con—
sisting of positive examples (reliably known interactions) and
negative examples (random pairs of proteins) was assembled.
For each example (a protein pair), 25 features (real numbered
values) measuring five types of data that suggest functional
association were computed. The quality of these features, i.e.
their ability to distinguish positive and negative examples, was
assessed. Then, a support vector machine prediction model was
created to determine the contrast between the feature values in

transactivation by G—protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling
pathway’ (GO:0035625) was connected to ‘sensory perception’
(GO:0007600). It was shown that epidermal growth factor recep—
tor can be transactivated in a calcium—dependent manner (Zwick
et al., 1997) and that sensory perception involves many G—pro—
tein coupled receptors that regulate calcium levels (Dong et al.,
2001).

On the other hand, in GO—BPLN, 24071 (61.7%) linkages
connected biological processes that shared one or more genes.
This percentage was signiﬁcantly larger than the percentage of
gene—sharing linkages expected in random biological process net—
works that were composed of the same processes, with each pro—
cess having the same number of neighbors (61.7% or 24071
interactions versus 29.5% or 11 518 interactions, P=1 x 10—3).
These data suggested correlation between the topology of GO—
BPLN and the compositions of these biological processes. It is
important to note that two gene—sharing processes were not ne—
cessarily connected. For example, the ‘activin receptor signaling
pathway’ (GO:0032924) and the ‘cellwell junction organization
process’ (GO:0045216) shared one gene, but this inter—gene—set
interaction density did not qualify for a substantial functional
linkage at the gene set level. Likewise, two biological processes
that shared no genes were not necessarily disconnected. For ex—
ample, ‘histone H3—K9 methylation’ (GO:0051567) was con—
nected to ‘negative regulation of transcription from RNA
polymerase II promoter’ (GO:0000122). This functional linkage
was supported by the ﬁnding that histone H3 methylation is
associated with transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase
II (Krogan et al., 2003; Lehnertz et al., 2003), and histone H3K9
methylation is required in siRNA—related centromeric gene silen—
cing, in which centromeric RNA is transcribed by RNA poly—
merase II (Moazed, 2009). Notably, this functional linkage was
identiﬁed based on the inferred functional interactions between
the SETD8, SIRT1 and HDAC family genes (which have the
annotation of negative regulation of transcription from the RNA
polymerase II promoter) and the histone methylation enzyme
SUV39H1. Therefore, successful identiﬁcation of this functional
linkage also suggested the usefulness of including inferred inter—
actions in HIR.

The above results indicated that the topology of the GO—
BPLN inferred by GSLA was consistent with our expectations,
with respect to the semantics and gene compositions of the GO
biological processes. In addition, we also conducted a case study
to show that GSLA identif1ed biological processes with func—
tional linkages to the c—Jun N—terminal kinase (JNK) cascade
process, which were mostly supported by previous research
(Supplemental Material). In short, our evaluation suggested
that GSLA reliably identiﬁed functional linkages between estab—
lished biological processes.

2.4 A case study to illustrate the capability of GSLA to
interpret the functional implications of observing a
gene set in an experiment

In addition to identifying functional linkages between well—estab—

lished biological processes, an important use of GSLA is to sug—

gest the functional implications of observing a gene set in an
experiment by connecting that gene set to established biological
processes. This use of GSLA is illustrated in the following

re—analysis of the expression profiles that describe statin—induced
selective apoptosis.

Statins are a family of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A
reductase inhibitors commonly used to treat patients with hyper—
cholesterolemia. Recently, statins were shown to induce apop—
tosis in a variety of tumor cells, including multiple myeloma
(MM) cells. However, a reduction in cancer risk was observed
only in some, but not all, MM patients undergoing early—phase
clinical trials. Therefore, it was important to understand the se—
lective mechanisms of statin. Clendening et al. reported that four
MM cell lines, H929, KMS11, LPl and SKMMl, showed
dichotomized responses to lovastatin. H929 and KMSll were
sensitive, whereas LPl and SKMMl were not. The statin—
induced expression changes that occurred in these cell lines
were examined using traditional annotation enrichment analysis
(AEA) (Clendening et al., 2010). Their results showed that 22
biological processes were enriched for differentially expressed
genes in the two insensitive cell lines. These processes included
the cholesterol—related metabolic processes, which were consist—
ent with the notion that lovastatin targets the cholesterol biosyn—
thesis pathway, and this pathway was transactivated by its
enzyme—level inhibition. In contrast, in the two sensitive cell
lines, no biological processes were consistently enriched; i.e. the
enzyme—level inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway
did not induce its expression.

Although AEA revealed the existence of different cellular re—
sponses to lovastatin, it identif1ed no biological process related to
apoptosis activation. However, the aim of measuring expression
proﬁles before the onset of apoptosis was to identify mechanisms
of statin action that are independent of the general apoptosis
changes (Clendening et al., 2010). For this purpose, AEA
failed to provide useful insight.

The same expression profiles were re—analyzed with GSLA.
The top 50 differentially expressed genes were used to deﬁne
the ‘expression phenotype’ of each cell line after lovastatin ex—
posure (Supplementary Table S3). AEA analysis of these pheno—
type gene sets generated the same conclusions as those reported
in the original publication (Supplementary Table S4), which sug—
gested that the top 50 genes from each proﬁle were adequate to
capture the differences between the statin responses in sensitive
and in insensitive cell lines.

GSLA analysis of these phenotype gene sets produced three
notable results (Supplementary Table S4). First, consistent with
AEA, GSLA indicated that cholesterol—related metabolic pro—
cesses were regulated in the insensitive cell lines but not in the
sensitive cell lines. However, unlike AEA, GSLA was able to
indicate that apoptosis—related biological processes were regu—
lated in the sensitive cell lines but not the insensitive cell lines,
which predicted the observed apoptosis behavior of the sensitive
cell lines. In addition, GSLA suggested cell line—specif1c biolo—
gical processes that might lead to the activation of apoptosis in
each sensitive cell line. In the KMSll cell line, toll—like receptor
(TLR) signaling pathways were regulated, whereas in the H929
cell line, Rho/GTPase signaling pathways were regulated. These
processes were known to be regulated by statin in other cell types
and are known triggers of apoptosis (Supplemental Material).

To evaluate the usefulness of GSLA, we also compared two
other analysis tools that interpret the biological significance of
experimental observations. The fixed network enrichment

analysis (FNEA) tool (Supplementary Table S5) is another net—
work—based tool that interprets the biological signiﬁcance of an
experimentally observed gene set (Alexeyenko et al., 2012). The
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) tool (Supplementary Table
S6) is a famous expression analysis tool that analyzes the entire
expression proﬁle instead of the highest altered genes. GSEA
does not use network information. In the scenario of two pheno—
types (treatment/control), GSEA can be considered to be a
simple enrichment analysis, but GSEA uses a score that is similar
to the score of the KolmogoroviSmirnov test to measure the
enrichment (Subramanian et al., 2005), whereas AEA uses a
hyper—geometric test to measure enrichment (Boyle et al., 2004).
Table 1 shows the ranks of four categories of biological pro—
cesses, which were most likely relevant to this study, in the results
produced by GSLA, AEA, FNEA and GSEA. The four cate—
gories included the apoptosis—related biological processes, which
represented the observed phenotype of statin—sensitive cell
lines; the cholesterol—related metabolic processes, which are the
pharmacological targets of statin action and distinguished the
statin—sensitive/insensitive cell lines in the classical AEA analysis;
and the TLR signaling pathways and the Rho/GTPase signaling
pathways, which were implicated by GSLA as cell line—speciﬁc
routes to active apoptosis (with indirect literature support).
AEA, FNEA and GSLA consistently identiﬁed the cholesterol
metabolic processes as the distinguishing responses between the
sensitive/insensitive cell lines, whereas with GSEA, one of the
sensitive cell lines also showed differential expression in the chol—
esterol metabolic processes (similar to the insensitive cell lines).
In addition, FNEA and GSLA consistently implicated that the
TLR signaling pathways and the Rho/GTPase signaling

pathways were regulated in the statin—sensitive cell lines.
However, only GSLA was able to indicate that the expression
changes of sensitive cell lines implied apoptosis activation.

In summary, this case study illustrated the difference between
GSLA and traditional enrichment analyses. GSLA identiﬁes the
biological processes the members of which have extensive func—
tional interactions to the changed genes that change in an experi—
ment. In other words, GSLA asks the question of what biological
processes these changed genes might together regulate. In con—
trast, enrichment analysis asks the question of what biological
processes constitute the changed genes. In other words, the
GSLA question is about the ‘functional implication’ of the chan—
ged genes, but the enrichment question is about the ‘identity’ of
the changed genes. Traditionally, with enrichment analyses, we
ﬁrst ﬁnd the ‘identity’ of the changed genes in terms of established
biological processes; then, we use our knowledge about these pro—
cesses to manually interpret the ‘functional implications’ of obser—
ving these processes. In contrast, GSLA directly provides the
‘functional implications’ without the need to explicitly deﬁne the
‘identity’ of the changed genes, thereby circumventing the problem
that some sets of changed genes observed in experiments might
not have an ‘identity’ in terms of established biological processes
(‘whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent’).

This case study was chosen to illustrate this difference. All of
the expression proﬁles were measured before the ﬁrst onset of
apoptosis. Therefore, the ‘identity’ of these profiles was not
apoptosis. Enrichment analyses, by design, are not expected to
annotate them to apoptosis. AEA analysis of the changed genes
in sensitive cell lines produced biological processes that are rela—
tively general in concept (Supplementary Table S4), which

suggests that these changed genes did not have a good ‘identity’
in terms of conceptually speciﬁc biological processes. Without
such an identity, our knowledge about biological mechanisms
cannot be used to interpret the functional implications of obser—
ving these changed genes. However, statin treatment induced
apoptosis in sensitive cells. Therefore, apoptosis activation is a
biologically important ‘functional implication’ of statin—induced
expression changes. GSLA is designed to detect such functional
implications without the prerequisite to answer the question of
what the changed genes are in terms of established biological
processes.

In addition, in GSLA analysis, functional linkages between
gene sets were supported by functional interactions between
the individual genes in HIR. Approximately 41% of these gene
level interactions represent physical protein interactions
(Supplemental Material). These interactions can provide further
assistance in the design of experiments to conﬁrm the functional
linkages at the gene set level.

2.5 Web interface to HIR and GSLA

The GSLA tool and its supporting HIR interactome have a
uniﬁed Web site (http://www.cls.zju.edu.cn/hir/). A lightweight
graphical network viewer was integrated within the Web site
for visualizing multiple functional interactions between genes
or gene sets. The functional linkages between GO biological
processes are pre—computed and can be searched with GO term
accessions. To link an observation—derived molecular profile to
established biological processes, the phenotype gene set must be
uploaded as a list of HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee
(HGNC) gene IDs. An ID mapping tool is provided for convert—
ing other gene or protein IDs to HGNC IDs. For each identiﬁed
functional linkage between gene sets, the gene level functional
interactions supporting this linkage are provided. All gene level
functional interactions in the HIR interactome can be queried at
the Web site or downloaded as compressed datasets. Functional
interactions can be searched by specifying one or both of their
component genes. Genes can be searched by their speciﬁc IDs or
by sequence. For each functional interaction, the multiple types
of data supporting this interaction are provided along with other
details of this interaction. In addition, although predicting gene
functions with the ‘guilt—by—association’ strategy does not actu—
ally implement the idea of GSLA (see Supplemental Material),
we nevertheless provide the predicted biological process annota—
tions for each gene in HIR to facilitate related research.

3 DISCUSSION

GSLA summarizes functional linkages at the individual gene
level to identify functional linkages at the gene set level.
Therefore, the quality of the reference network has a critical
impact on the usefulness of the approach. The reason why
GSLA produced biologically interesting functional linkages in
our assessments is most likely because GSLA used an interaction
network that has balanced coverage and speciﬁcity.

For example, assuming that we aim to identify functional link—
ages between speciﬁc biological concepts and, in particular, that
we aim to identify functional linkages between two small biolo—
gical processes, each consisting of 20 genes, if 10 functional

interactions between genes in these two processes were good evi—
dence for a biologically interesting gene set interaction, then we
would need a reference network that can cover at least 20% of
the true interactome to observe at least two inter—gene—set func—
tional interactions. In this case, a false—positive rate of only
5 x 10—3 false interactions per pair of genes would result in two
random false interactions between two 20—gene processes. If HIR
had a false—positive rate this high, such a signal—to—noise ratio
would make it difﬁcult to identify biologically meaningful func—
tional linkages. As detailed in the Supplemental Material, the
interactions in HIR were predicted using data before January
10, 2011. Using new interactions reported after this date, we
estimated that HIR covered 22.1% of the physical human inter—
actome with a per—interaction reliability of 41.0%. This per—inter—
action reliability corresponds to a false—positive rate of
5.08 x 10—4 false protein interactions per pair of genes or 0.2
random false protein interactions between two 20— gene processes.
This signal—to—noise ratio was likely to allow the identiﬁcation of
biologically meaningful functional linkages at the gene set level.

Before this work, several other human interactomes have been
developed, e. g. the STRING database (Franceschini et al., 2013)
and the HumanNet (Franceschini et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2011).
These interactomes were not rigorously assessed for their cover—
age and reliability using newly reported interactions. Typically,
they included half a million interactions or more (>2.5 x 10—3
interactions per pair of genes). In contrast, the rate of yeast pro—
tein interactions is ~1.3 x 10—3 per pair of genes (Yu et al., 2008),
and we estimated in this work that the rate of human interactions
is ~1.5 x 10—3 per pair of genes (Supplemental Material).
Therefore, the false—positive rates in these interactomes are
likely high, which might not provide sufﬁcient signal—to—noise
ratios for GSLA to identify biologically meaningful gene set
interactions. For example, if HumanNet or STRING was used
in the above statin case study, GSLA would no longer be able to
connect the expression changes in statin—sensitive cells to apop—
tosis—related biological processes.

To further improve our network—powered ‘functional implica—
tion’ interpretation approach, we believe that the bottleneck is
the creation of a high—quality network that can provide a sufﬁ—
cient signal—to—noise ratio for downstream approaches to accur—
ately summarize gene level functional interactions into gene set
level functional linkages. Our approach to building a protein
interaction—like functional interactome shows promise: GSLA
identiﬁed biologically meaningful functional linkages in a series
of assessments. However, this approach is still limited, primarily
because its theoretical basis involves many concepts that are still
poorly defined, particularly the ‘strength’ of a functional inter—
action. We hope that this work inspires future research to define
a rigorous and consistent measurement of the strength of a func—
tional interaction as suggested by multiple types of data, which is
likely the key to building accurate functional interactomes and
useful network—powered gene set interpretation approaches.

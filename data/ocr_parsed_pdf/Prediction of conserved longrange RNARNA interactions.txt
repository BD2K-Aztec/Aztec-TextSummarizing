with RNAalifold (Bernhart et £11., 2008) secondary structure
foldings based on minimum free energy calculations are used to
predict possible LRIs. We add several ﬁlter steps and scoring
functions to reduce false positive candidates. We conﬁrm 14 out
of 16 experimentally known and evolutionary conserved LRIs
in HCV, Tombusviruses, Flaviviruses and HIV—1. We predict
several promising new interactions, being highly conserved in all
considered viral sequences with multiple compensatory mutations
and highly conserved in all considered viral sequences.

2 METHODS

With LRI scan we propose for the ﬁrst time a method for conserved
genome—wide long—range RNA—RNA interaction (LRI) prediction in viral
genomes based on a multiple sequence alignment. LRIscan is based on
the C—library of the ViennaRNA Package 2 . O (Lorenz et al., 2011).
The pipeline consists of four basic steps (see workﬂow Fig. 1):

(1) Calculate alignment coverage and complexity.

(2) Find LRI seeds with a sparse dotplot method.

(3) Filter LRI candidates based on MFE; calculate z—score/p—value and
compensatory score.

(4) Extend seed interaction.

The input of LRIscan is a nucleotide alignment A of length n with m
sequences. By A,- we denote the i—th column of the alignment. Entry (1?
is the k—th row of column i. We deﬁne the alignment coverage for each
column A,- as percentage of nucleotides over all sequences m, without

gaps. We introduce the pairing matrix H with entries Hij : 1 if at
least t percent (default t : 0.95 for more than 100 sequences, otherwise
default t : 0.80) of the corresponding sequences can form a base—pair

(aﬁaf) e {AU,UA, UG, GU, GC,CG}, otherwise Hi, : 0.

2.1 Alignment cleaning, coverage, complexity

To improve the alignment quality for the nucleotide folding, rarely occurring
IUPAC nucleotide ambiguities are replaced by the most occurring valid
nucleotides of the same alignment column.

We introduce the coverage matrix <I> with entries <I>ij : 1 if the coverage
of columns A,- and Aj is greater than the minimum coverage deﬁned by the
user (default 0.5), otherwise <I>ij : 0.

Let 6 be the compression function replacing stretches of identical
nucleotides by a single nucleotide, e.g. 6(AAGUUUCC) : AGUC.

The complexity for each alignment column A,- is stored by the complexity
matrix C computed as

1 m i6(a§...i+sil)i

OPE:

1

k:1 iaf...i+sili 7 ( )
where s is the minimum seed interaction length (default: 5bp). With
the complexity score we avoid calculations of regions with gaps or low
complexity, such as poly—A/U stretches.

A minimum coverage and complexity threshold can be deﬁned by the user
(default: coverage : 0.5, complexity : 0.5), with a direct effect on run
time.

2.2 LRI seed detection

To ﬁnd LRIs we use a dotplot calculation combined with several base—pairing
criteria computed by RNAalifold (Bernhart et al., 2008). To efﬁciently
identify interacting seed regions, we initialize the dotplot seed matrix S with
SM : 0. Each entry Sijj with minimum distance 11) between column i and
j (default 11) : 100 nt) is calculated, following the recursion:

Sid : (Si71,j+1 +Hij)-<I>ij, 0 < i < n—w,i+w <j< 71(2)

SM will be considered as seed candidate, if (i) Si+1jj71 : 0 and
SM 2 .9, (ii) the minimum free energy of the seed alignment, calculated
by RNAalifold, is smaller as the maximum MFE deﬁned by the user
(default — 10 kcal/mol), and (iii) the mean sequence complexity of the seed
is greater than the user deﬁned threshold (see red dots in Fig. 1B).

To speed up the seed ﬁnding, which needs quadratic time 0(n2), multiple
CPU’s can be used. Each CPU calculates a row of 100m (see Fig. 1B)
overlapping by the minimum seed length .9. To save memory, we store only
the last valid entry for each seed in a hash.

2.3 LRI seed scoring

For each LRI, we calculate the MFE with RNAalifold. Sequences

including only gaps are neglected. Based on the MFE we calculate a z—score

to determine the reliability of each LRI, compared to a randomly sampled

alignment. The z—score, can be calculated for each predicted LRI as
X — M

i 0

length. (C) For all seeds we calculate the minimum free energy (MFE)
of the alignment with RNAalifold. For each seed passing the MFE
threshold (red dots in B) we calculate a p—value based on the z—score and
the compensatory score as deﬁned in the methods. (D) Seeds are extended
towards both sides. An extended z—score/p—value and compensatory score is
calculated.

core gene C. The inner circle shows all predicted interactions between all genome positions. gray — all new LRIs; colored — LRIs corresponding to B and C.
The plot was created with Circos (Krzywinski et al., 2009). (B) Experimentally veriﬁed LRIs, which can be predicted by LRI s can, named SLIIId—5BSL3.2
(Romero—Lopez and Berzal—Herranz, 2012, 2009), 5BSL2—5BSL3.2 (Romero—Lopez et al., 2014; Tuplin et al., 2012), 5BSL3.2—3’SLII (Friebe et al., 2005)
and 5’UTR—core (Beguiristain et al., 2005; Honda et al., 1999). (C) Highly interesting new LRIs predicted by LRI scan. In a former study, we suggested that
LRI 26’ could be a seed interaction for a HCV genome circularization (Fricke et al., 2015). A complete list including all predicted LRIs can be found at the
supplemental page. Colors are used to indicate conserved base—pairs: from red (no variation of a base—pair within the alignment) to purple (all six base—pair
types are found); from dark (all sequences contain this base—pair) to light colors (1 or 2 sequences are unable to form this base—pair). Compensatory mutations

are marked by a circle around the variable base(s).

(Fig. 2A) to detect regions with a high number of interactions.
Interestingly, we detected some highly reactive regions in the 5’
UTR and 3’ UTR, but also high reactivity sites in the CDS of the
core and NSSB protein coding region. The UTRs and the core
region show the highest amount of possible LRIs, in agreement
with the known highly structured regions for all HCV subtypes
(Fricke et £11., 2015). Consistent with regions of high reactivity
(superior interacting regions), it has been shown that the 5’ UTR
includes three LRIs (Filbin and Kieft, 2011; Romero—Lopez and
Berzal—Herranz, 2012, 2009; Beguiristain et £11., 2005; Honda et £11.,
1999).

For HCV, ﬁve LRIs have been experimentally veriﬁed: SLII—
SLIV (Filbin and Kieft, 2011), SLIIId—5BSL3.2 (Romero—Lopez
and Berzal—Herranz, 2012, 2009), 5BSL2—5BSL3.2 (Romero—
Lopez et £11., 2014; Tuplin et £11., 2012), 5BSL3.2—3’SLII (Friebe
et £11., 2005) and 5’UTR—core (Beguiristain et £11., 2005; Honda
et £11., 1999). We identiﬁed three known LRIs within the ﬁrst
58 hits ranked by p—value (Fig. 2B). We missed SLII—SLIV
because of the unfavourable seed MFE of only —7 kcal/mol (default
threshold —10kcal/mol). The LRI SLIIId—5BSL3.2 did not pass our
conservative p—value threshold, but is part of the LRI s can output
(LRI 2d). Increasing the MFE or p—value threshold would increase

the amount of LRIs dramatically, very likely resulting in a high false
positive rate (Fig. 3).

We present three highly interesting new LRIs based on p—value,
compensatory score and location in the HCV genome (Fig. 2C).

The LRI g of Fig. 2 (LRI 2g) is one of the best ranked LRI with a
very long seed interaction of 8 nt and three compensatory base—pairs,
whereof one base—pair consists of three different types of base—pairs
changed in both sites. This LRI is conserved in 89/106 isolates and
spans a distance of 754 nt between 5’ UTR and the coding region
of the core protein. An experimental veriﬁcation of the interactions
would be highly recommended.

LRI 2f is also highly conserved in all isolates and spans a distance
of 9440 nt, connecting the 5’UTR with the NSSB coding regions
(corresponding to LRI 4 in Fricke et al. (2015)). We identiﬁed also
the possible genome circularization 2e) between 5’SLII and 3’DLS
(see Fricke et al. (2015)).

3.2 Flavivirus

For Flavivirus genomes we used LRIscan with default values.
We predicted 113/157 LRIs with a p—value smaller 0.05. Although
Flaviviruses and Hepacivirus are both assigned to the family
Flaviviridae, the LRI distribution is very different. In Flaviviruses,
we found some clearly separated peaks with an accumulation of

Fig. 3. Plot of predicted LRIs in the HCV alignment using different MFE
thresholds. The default threshold is —10kcal/mol resulting in 311 LRIs.
With increasing MFE threshold, the number of predicted LRI increases
dramatically and therewith the false positive rate. Thus, we decided to
choose a conservative MFE threshold. black — cumulative sum of LRIs per
MFE threshold. gray — sum of LRIs per MFE threshold

LRIs, located at the 3’ end of gene M and in the center of the NS3
and N85 gene (Fig. 4A). Different from the HCV alignment, we
did not ﬁnd an accumulation of LRIs in the 5’ UTR and 3’ UTR.
This effect could be explained by different sequence conservations

of the UTRs. In HCV the pairwise identity of the UTRs is >
95 %, whereas the UTR pairwise identity of the Flaviviruses is
< 50 %. The Flavivirus alignment consists of only six sequences,
including only the mosquito/vertebrate Flaviviruses. In Flavivirus
three experimentally veriﬁed LRIs are known: 5’—3’—UAR, DAR
and 5’—3’—CS (Khromykh et £11., 2001; Zhang et £11., 2008; Alvarez
et £11., 2005; Corver et £11., 2003; You et £11., 2001; Friebe and Harris,
2010). All known interactions are in close proximity and can build
a genome circularization, essential for the viral replication. The
strongest interaction (CS), was ranked at fourth position (Fig. 4B).
It was not possible to identify the 5’—3’—UAR and DAR, because the
seed region does not appear to be conserved in the highly variable
5’ UTR.

However, we found several new promising LRIs (Fig. 4C) in the
considered Flaviviruses. All depicted interactions are ranked among
the ﬁrst 75 hits and show a high amount of compensatory mutations
(up to four types of base—pairs) and being conserved in all sequences.

3.3 Tombusvirus

For the genomes of the Tombusviridae we used LRIscan with
default parameters. We found 529 LRIs (213 LRIs with p < 0.05).
Most of the LRIs in Tombusvirus are located in the p92 region (Fig.
5A). This is in line with the already known interactions, where four
out of eight known LRIs start in the p92 region (Cimino et £11.,
2011; Wu et £11., 2009; Lin and White, 2004). But also the intergenic
regions between p41/p22 and the 3’ end of the p92 coding regions
show high reactivity (Fig. 5A). These areas harbor the known

UL—DL (Wu et al., 2009), sg2—SLB (Fabian and White, 2004), AS1—RS1 (Lin and White, 2004), AS2—RS2 (Lin and White, 2004). (C) Highly interesting new

interacting regions of the AS 1/RSl, DE/CE, sgl/SLB, AS2/RS2,
sg2/SLB (Wu et £11., 2009; Lin and White, 2004; Fabian and White,
2004). In contrast, the p41 region contains only a few predicted
LRIs. This is due to the very variable sequence of this gene, which
encodes the coat protein of the Tombusviruses.

In addition to the mentioned ﬁve, three more LRIs are known
from experimental data for Tombusviruses: SL3—SLB (Fabian and
White, 2004, 2006; Nicholson and White, 2008), PRTE—DRTE
(Cimino et £11., 2011), UL—DL (Wu et £11., 2009). We detected six
of the eight known LRIs (Fig. 5B). AS2—RS2 was ranked very low
due to a very short seed of 5 bp, a low p—value and a poly—G stretch.
The missing SL3—SLB and DE—CE have been only described for
one species and are also manually not discoverable in other species.
Both interactions are located in variable regions with low conserved
RNA sequences. Here, we present three novel LRIs (Fig. 5C). The
LRI 5g with strong compensatory mutations in 6 of 6 base—pairs
and up to four types is conserved in all sequences. The LRIs 5h
and 51' are conserved in all sequences and have a very high rank,
as well as compensatory base—pairs with up to three types of base—
pairs mutated at both interaction sites. The introduced LRIs are
interesting candidates for further wet lab studies.

3.4 HIV

For the HIV alignment, LRIscan was used with default
parameters. Only 20% of HIV genomes (40 sequences) contained
a complete 5’ and 3’ UTR, therefore we decreased the minimum

involved sequences to 20%. With these settings we identiﬁed 314
LRIs (115 LRIs withp < 0.05).

In HIV, ﬁve LRIs are known termed R—GAG, LDI, U5—AUG,
TAR—TAR and GAG—U3R (Huthoff and Berkhout, 2001; Abbink
and Berkhout, 2003; Andersen et £11., 2004; Ooms et £11., 2007;
Beerens and Kjems, 2010). We identiﬁed three of the known
interactions: U5—AUG, TAR—TAR and LDI, (Fig. 6B). Due to
the conservative MFE threshold it was not possible to detect the
conserved R—GAG interaction. For the GAG—U3R interactions no
conserved seed interaction exists.

We also suggest three novel LRIs (Fig. 6C). These LRIs are
conserved in all 200 sequences and have several compensatory
mutations. LRI 6d is ranked at position one and has compensatory
mutations in 7 out of 9 base—pairs with up to 3 different base—pair

types.

3.5 Comparison to CovaRNA

We compare LRI s can to CovaRNA, designed for large eukaryotic
genomes. CovaRNA outputs no reliable results for the small
viral genomes. For the HCV and for the Tombusvirus alignment,
CovaRNA found only one covariation cluster consisting of only
two base—pairs. This cluster covers no known LRI. No cluster could
be identiﬁed for the HIV alignment. The output of the Flavivirus
alignment includes ﬁve covariation clusters. All clusters contain
only two base—pairs and cover none of the known LRIs.

3.6 Sensitivity and speciﬁcity

An accurate sensitivity/speciﬁcity calculation is difﬁcult due to the
limited number of experimentally veriﬁed LRIs. We reach a mean
sensitivity of 0.83. Most of the non—detected true positive LRIs
are speciﬁc and experimentally veriﬁed only for single isolates.
We investigated their conservation throughout the individuals of
the alignment manually, resulting in isolate—speciﬁc LRIs. The
sensitivity is independent on the sequence number and alignment
identity (see Tab. 1). The mean speciﬁcity of 0.64 depicts a rather
high number of false positives. A more stringent p—value would
remove a large fraction of false positives, however, results also in
a loss of true positive LRIs, see Fig. 2, 4—6. In practice, known LRIs
have very small p—values (high ranks) and/or high compensatory
scores and/or can be extended in length. The user selects the LRIs

based on all metrics and on the regions of interests. A minimal p—
value threshold including almost all experimental veriﬁed LRIs can
be found at 0.05.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The identiﬁcation of long—range RNA—RNA interactions is experi—
mentally and bioinformatically a challenging task. The huge amount
of theoretically possible interactions makes it impossible to verify
all possible interactions by wet lab experiments. LRIscan offers
the opportunity to predict possible LRIs under certain criteria and
reduces dramatically the number of candidates for wet lab studies.
As shown in part A of Fig. 2—6, also well studied viruses provide a
huge list of highly ranked LRIs, which could be involved in viral
translation and transcription mechanisms. Further wet lab studies,
which verify the functionality of these interactions, could improve
our understanding of the viral replication.

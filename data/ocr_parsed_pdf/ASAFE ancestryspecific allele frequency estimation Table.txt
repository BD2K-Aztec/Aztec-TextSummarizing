Abstract

Summary: In a genome—wide association study (GWAS) of an admixed population, such as
Hispanic Americans, ancestry—specific allele frequencies can inform the design of a replication
GWAS. We derive an EM algorithm to estimate ancestry—specific allele frequencies for a bi—allelic
marker given genotypes and local ancestries on a 3—way admixed population, when the phase of
each admixed individual’s genotype relative to the pair of local ancestries is unknown. We call our
algorithm Ancestry Specific Allele Frequency Estimation (ASAFE). We demonstrate that ASAFE

has low error on simulated data.

1 Introduction

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in humans have focused
on populations of European origin. Hispanic Americans however,
have descended from ancestral Africans, Europeans and Native
Americans. Hispanics exemplify an admixed population, one that
has descended from multiple ancestral populations.

After discovering that an allele is significantly associated with a
trait in a GWAS of admixed individuals, it would be useful to know
the allele’s ancestry-specific frequencies. For a sample of Hispanic
individuals, an ancestry-specific allele frequency would be the fre-
quency of the allele amongst the chromosomes in the sample that
have a particular ancestral origin (either African, European, or
Native American) at the marker. Such frequencies provide informa-
tion about which populations the discovered association might also
be present in, thereby informing the choice of study population for
replication.

To obtain estimates of ancestry-specific allele frequencies, one
might find the allele frequency in each reference panel. However,
this approach is impossible for a marker that is present in the
admixed sample, but absent from a reference panel. This situation
arises when the reference panels are genotyped on a SNP array and

when the admixed individuals have sequence data. Even for a
marker that is typed in the reference panels, this approach suffers
when the reference panels do not exactly match the ancestral popu-
lations. For example, none of the populations in the 1000 Genomes
Project (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2015) are non-
admixed Native American. The ADMIXTURE and STRUCTURE
programs can use admixed genotypes to estimate ancestry-specific
allele frequencies, but require genotypes from reference individuals
of known ancestry in order to identify the frequencies with particu-
lar ancestries. (Alexander et (11., 2009; Pritchard et (11., 2000)
Furthermore, ADMIXTURE assumes linkage equilibrium amongst
markers, and STRUCTURE’s linkage model assumes linkage equi-
librium amongst markers descended from the same ancestral popu-
lation. (Falush et (11., 2003) In contrast, we utilize estimates of local
ancestry, such as those from the RFMix program (Maples et (11.,
2013). Estimates oflocal ancestry from such programs utilize haplo-
type frequencies, and thus make use of linkage disequilibrium. At
markers genotyped in all the reference panels, one can directly ob-
tain ancestry specific allele frequencies from the phased genotypes
and corresponding phased local ancestry estimates. However, at

markers not genotyped in a reference panel, the phasing of the local
ancestries relative to the genotypes is unknown and further method—
ology is needed to obtain ancestry specific allele frequency estimates.

Here, we derive an EM algorithm (ASAFE) to estimate ancestry—
specific allele frequencies at a bi—allelic marker in a three—way
admixed diploid population, given admixed local ancestries and
genotypes at the marker, with each admixed individual’s genotype
allele order relative to ancestry order unknown. The major advan—
tage of ASAFE over alternative ancestry—specific allele frequency es—
timation approaches is that ASAFE is applicable to markers in the
admixed sample that are absent from a reference panel.
Furthermore, ASAFE takes advantage of linkage—disequilibrium
based information by using local ancestry calls.

Gravel et al. (2013) describe a somewhat similar algorithm to
ASAFE, but only for two—way admixture, and in the slightly differ—
ent setting of estimating the ancestral allele frequency in several
closely related ancestral populations (such as the Native American
ancestors of Columbians, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans). They do
not provide a publicly available implementation of their method.

We provide a publicly available implementation of our algo—
rithm, and a description of its performance on simulated Hispanic
data. Our algorithm applies to any diploid admixed population des—
cended from three ancestral populations, so our method is not re—
stricted to human populations.

2 Methods

A local ancestry inference program such as RFMix (Maples et al.,
2013) can be used to estimate the ancestry across the genome in an
admixed sample. Local ancestral segments tend to extend over long
genomic distances in recently admixed populations because they are
ended only by recombination since the admixture event. Thus al—
though the ancestry may only be estimated at positions that are gen—
otyped in both the admixed and reference individuals, the local
ancestry at most intermediate positions can be inferred with
confidence.

Given local ancestries and genotypes at each SNP, ancestry—spe—
cific allele frequencies can be estimated independently for each SNP,
using an EM algorithm that handles unknown genotype phase rela—
tive to ancestry phase to estimate three ancestry—specific allele fre—
quencies for a bi—allelic marker. We call this algorithm Ancestry
Specific Allele Frequency Estimation (ASAFE). Input data to ASAFE
are individuals” ancestry pairs for the SNPs for which one would like
estimates, and the same individuals” genotypes at these SNPs. A der—
ivation of the EM algorithm is given in the Supplementary
Information.

We simulated 10 Mb of sequence data for individuals from each
of three populations representing Europeans, West Africans and
Native Americans. We used 250 individuals from each population
as reference individuals, and created 250 admixed individuals from
additional simulated individuals. Details are in the Supplementary
Information.

We then applied ASAFE to the admixed data, treating genotypes
as unphased and using the known ancestries of the simulated
admixed individuals in the analysis. We gave ASAFE admixed geno—
types and ancestries at 56 003 SNPs, and for each SNP, obtained the
allele frequencies for each of three ancestries, African, European,
and Native American. The computation time was 0.5 h on a Linux
server with a Intel Xeon CPU E5—2630L 2.0 GHZ processor.

We assessed the accuracy of ASAFE in the following way. For
each SNP, we estimated ancestry—specific allele frequencies for the
derived allele. For each ancestry, at each SNP, we subtracted the
true ancestry—specific allele frequency from the estimated ancestry—
specific allele frequency. We considered the true ancestry—specific al—
lele frequency to be the sample frequency of the allele amongst
admixed chromosomes descended from that ancestry. To see if the
accuracy of ASAFE might differ depending on the true ancestry—spe—
cific allele frequency, we binned SNPs by their true ancestry—specific
allele frequencies.

3 Results

Table 1 gives summary statistics on ASAFE’s error in estimating an—
cestry—specific allele frequencies for 250 admixed individuals.
ASAFE has low error across all allele frequency bins and ancestries.

Supplementary Table 51 shows error summary statistics for vari—
ous combinations of the three ancestral population allele frequen—
cies. The tested frequency combinations cover a broad range of
possibilities that might be observed for populations more or less
diverged than our simulated Hispanic scenario. Accuracy remains
high in each case. Mean errors (bias) are at most 0.001 in absolute
value and SDs are at most 0.03, with the highest SDs being observed
when the three frequencies are close to each other. Supplementary
Table 52 shows error summary statistics when local ancestry is
called with error. Adding 7% diploid error to the local ancestry calls
leads to mean errors (bias) of at most 0.05 in absolute value while
SDs are at most 0.04.

4 Conclusion

As more GWASs are performed in admixed populations such as
Hispanics, it is becoming increasingly important to estimate ances—
try—specific allele frequencies for bi—allelic markers. We derived an
EM algorithm to estimate ancestry—specific allele frequencies given
data on a 3—way admixed population and provide a publicly avail—
able implementation of the algorithm.

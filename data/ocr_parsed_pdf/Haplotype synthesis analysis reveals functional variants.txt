Abstract

Motivation: The functional mechanisms underlying disease association remain unknown for
Genome—wide Association Studies (GWAS) susceptibility variants located outside coding regions.
Synthesis of effects from multiple surrounding functional variants has been suggested as an explan—
ation of hard—to—interpret findings. We define filter criteria based on linkage disequilibrium measures
and allele frequencies which reflect expected properties of synthesizing variant sets. For eligible
candidate sets, we search for haplotype markers that are highly correlated with associated variants.
Results: Via simulations we assess the performance of our approach and suggest parameter set—
tings which guarantee 95% sensitivity at 20—fold reduced computational cost. We apply our method
to 1000 Genomes data and confirmed Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) variants. A
proportion of 36.9% allowed explanation by three—variant—haplotypes carrying at least two func—
tional variants, as compared to 16.4% for random variants (P : 1.72 x 10’8). Association could be
explained by missense variants for MUC19, PER3 (CD) and HMG20A (T2D). In a CD GWAS—
imputed using haplotype reference consortium data (64 976 haplotypesl—we could confirm the
syntheses of MUC19 and PER3 and identified synthesis by missense variants for 6 further genes
(ZGPAZ, GPR65, CLN3/NPIPBS, LOC102723878, r32872507, GCKR). In all instances, the odds ratios
of the synthesizing haplotypes were virtually identical to that of the index SNP. In summary, we
demonstrate the potential of synthesis analysis to guide functional follow—up of GWAS findings.

Haplotype synthesis analysis

out by the authors of Dickson et al. (2010) and Platt et al. (2010)
there is no guarantee that causal variants are in particular high LD
with the top association signal (we will call the tag variant through—
out this work). For instance, interaction between multiple variants
may interfere with the ability to find either of them separately, but
create a signal at a distantly linked marker (Atvvell et al., 2010).

Goldstein (2009), see also Edge et al. (2013), suggested that an
association of a common variant with a complex disease can be syn—
thetically created by multiple rarer functional variants from a sur—
rounding genomic region. In this case the rarer variants occur more
often or exclusively on a haplotype branch carrying a specific allele
of the tag variant, generating in this way the strongest association
signal at this locus. This situation is depicted in Figure 1 of Wang
et al. (2010). The idea can be quantified by checking whether the
LD measures between tag variant and candidate variants yield
)D’) z 1, while R2 need not be large (Goldstein, 2009; Takeuchi
et al., 2011). Examples for such synthetic associations have been re—
ported from GWAS (Fellay et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2013; Scherag
et al., 2010; Takeuchi et al., 2009; Wadelius et al., 2007) and
sequencing studies (Wang et al., 2010). A statistical method to test a
given set of variants for synthetic association with a quantitative
trait has been described by (Takeuchi et al., 2011).

The concept of synthetic association has also given rise to some
debate: some authors considered the ubiquity of synthetic associ—
ations to be unlikely (Orozco et al., 2010), while others discussed
whether synthetic associations should have already been detected by
linkage analysis (Anderson et al., 2011; Goldstein, 2011) and
whether a rare—only model is applicable to a lot of GWAS findings
(Goldstein, 2011; Wray et al., 201 1). In addition, the expected prop—
erties of synthetic associations were empirically assessed via simula—
tion studies (Chang and Keinan, 2012; Dickson et al., 2010), with
partially contradictory results. The authors of Dickson et al. (2010)
stated that rarer variants that contribute to a synthetic association
might be as far as 2.5 Megabases (Mb) away, whereas the authors
of Chang and Keinan (2012) reported that in 90% of their simula—
tions at least one rare causal variant was already captured within a
window of size 100 kilobases (kb). In any case, it can be stated that
until now there is no complete understanding of which role synthetic
associations actually play in the etiology of complex diseases, and
how frequent the phenomenon of synthesis really is.

In view of the lacking consensus, we started an empirical evalu—
ation of the frequency of the phenomenon. Until now, no methods
have been provided to systematically search for sets of variants that
synthesize the association of a common variant. A major reason for
this is the computational load. Already within a :100 kb region sur—
rounding a susceptibility locus, typically 2000 variants are to be ex—
pected. With n eligible variants in an identified trait—related
susceptibility region, there are 2" — 1 variant sets to be investigated.
Even when only sets with, for instance, up to 6 variants shall be
tested for potential synthesis, 8.84 X 1016 different sets have to be
investigated. In view of the large number, an efficient search engine
is prerequisite for the detection of synthetic associations.
Identification of such variant sets is highly relevant for the follow—up
of association signals that were produced by GWAS or next gener—
ation sequencing (NGS) association studies, in order to come closer
disease relevant biological function (Marian, 2012).

2 Methods and data

We consider an LD region that is associated with a disease pheno—
type. The top association signal (tag variant) has been reported in a

GWAS catalog or a consensus meta—analysis. We assume that geno—
type data, either from public reference data, GWAS or NGS associ—
ation studies, are available for the tag variant and a sufficiently large
surrounding region. We advise to include variants from a 2 or 5 Mb
flanking region around the tag variant.

2.1 Filtering rules

Let a,, A, be the alleles of variant 5,. Let f(a,) be the allele frequency of
a, and let la(a,a,) be the frequency of the 2—variants haplotype. The al—
leles a, and a, are said to be in-plaase if D : la(a,~a,~) — f(a,~)f(a,~) > 0.
From the data we calculate the allele frequencies and the LD measures
R2 : DZ/(a,a,-A,A,-) and D’ : D/Dmx, where Dmax : min (a,a,-,A,~
A,-) if D < 0 and Dmax : min (a,A,-,A,a,) if D > 0. Note that D’ com—
prises a leading sign.

We employ the following allele frequency criteria for synthetic
association. Let S : {51. . . . .sk} be a set of k variants and let 5 a S
be the tag variant. Let D’(a,.a,). R2(a,. a,) be the pairwise LD meas—
ures for two variants s,, 5,. Let D and R be predefined intervals
that quantify conditions on )D’) z 1 and R2 and let t2 1 be a toler—
ance parameter.

Let a be the risk allele of s, i.e. the allele with OR > 1. Let a, be
the alleles of s, that are in—phase with a. S is said to be a risk candi-
date set if

1. lD’(a,.a)lEDl /\ R2(a,.a)ER2 Vie{1...k}.
12

2~ f(a)/t S Zﬂdi) S f(d)'t7
i:1

In the same way, we can regard A to be the protective allele of s,
i.e. the allele with a reported OR < 1. Let now A, be the alleles of s,
that are in—phase with A. S is then said to be a protective candidate
set if the above criteria hold, whereupon the second condition is
replaced by k

2~f(A)/t S Zf<Ai) S f(A)'t-
i:1

One may also see this twofold search from a different perspec—
tive: once we seek candidate sets that are synthesized by the minor
allele of the tag variant, which means D’(a,.a) > 0, and another
where the sets are synthesized by the major allele of the same,
D’ (a,.a) < 0.

Note that in Eq. 2, an immediate consequence of the target SNP
being an ancestor of the rarer causal variants would be t:1. In
practice, t> 1 can be caused by genotyping errors or rare recombi—
natorial. Furthermore, it is necessary to completely omit the fre—
quency criterion to capture also syntheses involving frequent
recombinants. Desirable choices of the parameters are evaluated in
the next paragraph.

In the context of this work, we prune variants for R2 : 1, while
we do not remove variants that are marked to have known func—
tional consequences. More details on our implementation are given
in appendix A (Supplementary Data).

2.2 Tag variant: set haplotype correlation

The goal of our approach is to find variant sets that explain a given
tag variant via synthesis, in particular to find haplotypes that are in
nearly perfect LD with one of the alleles of the tag variant. For a
candidate set S of tag variant 5 we phase and reconstruct the haplo—
types from the genotypes employing the EM—algorithm using max—
imum—likelihood estimation of haplotype frequencies according to
Excoffier and Slatkin (1995) and Long et al.(1995). Here, we use an
implementation that improves our previous implementation in
FAMHAP (Becker and Knapp, 2004). We evaluate the haplotypes in
a binary storing version, which is presented in detail in appendix B

(Supplementary Data). From the reconstructed haplotypes with their
estimated frequencies we compose dichotomized haplotype markers
consisting each of one haplotype versus all others. Then we calculate
the Pearson product—moment correlation coefficient of that allele x
of tag variant 5 which is tested for being synthesized by S and each

2.3 Data

For pilot analysis, we systematically searched for syntheses in the
CEU sample of the 1000 Genomes Project phase 1 integrated release
(1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) reference data (accessed
Mar 2012). For confirmation, we used a GWAS on Crohn’s disease
(CD) with 1598 individuals (480 cases and 1118 controls) geno—
typed with Illumina© HumanHap550 Bead array. CD patients were
recruited either at the Department of General Internal Medicine,
Christian—Albrechts—University, Kiel, and the Charité University
Hospital, Berlin, through local outpatient services, or nationwide
with the support of the German Crohn and Colitis Foundation. The
1118 German healthy control individuals were obtained from the
Popgen biobank (Krawczak et al., 2006).

The GWAS contributed to most relevant CD findings and is
described in detail at Jostins et al. (2012). We adapted quality con—
trol standards described there. The GWAS was imputed the refer—
ence panel form the haplotype reference consortium (http://www.
haplotype—reference—consortium.org/), first release consisting of 64
976 haplotypes at 39 235 157 SNPs (McCarthy, 2015). Imputation
was performed at the Michigan Imputation Server (MIS; https://
imputationserver.sph.umich.edu) using SHAPEIT2 (Deleneau et al.,
2013) and Minimac3

(http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Minimac3) with default
parameters.

2.4 Simulation study

In order to evaluate our filter criteria, we set up simulation based on
the imputed CD GWAS data. We repeatedly selected k—tuples (k : 3,
5) of functional SNPs with a maximum distance of 4 MB and simu—
lated a hypothetical tag SNP with rxi, : 1 with the k—tuple (full syn—
thesis). We then tried to retrieve the synthesis in the surrounding
region of the tag SNP, both in the complete sample, as well as in a
sub—sample of 300 randomly selected individuals. Under each set—
ting, we simulated 1000 datasets and evaluated each of these under
5 filter parameter configurations (3).

3 Results

3.1 Results of simulation study

The simulated data was evaluated according to different filters,
upper limit for R2 (software option —filter-R2-upper {decimal}),
lower limit for D’ (—filter-d-prime-lower {decimal}) and limit for t
(—filter-tolerance {decimal}). We did not apply a lower limit for R2
or an upper limit for D’. The exploration of an upper limit for R2 is
motivated by the results in Goldstein (2009) and Takeuchi et al.

(2011). We applied five settings, from strong filtering to exhaust—
ive search, setting 1 (0.49 as upper limit for R2, 0.7 as lower limit
for D’, 1.2 as upper limit for t), setting 2 (1.0, 0.7, 1.2) with
no upper limit for R2, setting 3 (1.0, 0.7, 1.5) with, in addition,
relaxed limit for t, setting 4 (1.0, 1.0, 1.5) with, in addition, no limit
for D’ and setting 5 (1.0, 1.0, —), exhaustive search without filters
active.

The results of the simulation study can be found in Table 1. We
list the percentage of datasets )rxh) for which we retrieved the tuple
that actually was used to simulate the tag SNP.

We first discuss the analysis of the entire sample. With exhaust—
ive search (setting 5 without filters active) our software was able to
retrieve all syntheses (100% sensitivity). Under filter settings 3 and
4, specificity remains high (95%), both for 3— and 5—SNP—tuples.
There is no difference in performance between settings 3 and 4, indi—
cating that a filter on D’ can be applied without loss of sensitivity.
Under setting 2, a substantially worse performance is observed (sen—
sitivity < 85%). Setting 1, with the most stringent filtering, has low
sensitivity (around 60%) and cannot be recommended.

Interestingly, sensitivity is also very good when only a sub sam—
ple of limited size is analyzed. In particular for [6:33, sensitivity
is very close to that in the whole sample, irrespective of the
filtering parameters. For k :5, the loss of sensitivity is more pro—
nounced, under the exhaustive search, for instance, sensitivity drops
to 91 %.

With filters active, running time typically is reduced substan—
tially. Comparing exhaustive search (setting 5) and setting 1 for 5—
tuples, a factor of 160 for the whole and of 177 for the sub—sample
can be observed. Under setting 3, for 5—SNP—tuples, we observe a re—
duction by a factor of 22.5 for the whole sample and by 20.0 for the
sub sample. For 5—SNP—tuples, we observe reductions by factors of
18.5 and 19.3, respectively.

In summary, balancing computational cost and trade—off in spe—
cificity, filter setting 3 is recommendable when computational re—
sources are limited.

3.2 Frequency of the synthesis phenomenon in 1000
Genomes data

Nearly perfect pairwise LD (R2 z 1) between neighbouring variants
is a common phenomenon. Likewise, perfect LD between a single
variant and a haplotype marker is likely to exist in regions of strong
LD. In order to assess the frequency of the phenomenon, we ran—
domly selected 1000 variant markers from the Illumina© 550K
marker panel. For these variants, we systematically searched for all
three—marker syntheses in a 2Mb surrounding interval in the 1000
Genomes Project Consortium (2012) data. In Table 2, we list the ab—
solute numbers and proportions of syntheses for )rxh) of either 0.995
or 0.975. A portion of 69.4% (55.7%) of tag variant markers
allowed a synthesis by three surrounding variants at an rxb cut—off of
0.975 (0.995). We investigated how many of these syntheses com—
prised ‘broad—sense’ functional variants, i.e. variants classified not as
‘unknown’, ‘intergenic’ or ‘intronic’. 55.6% (42.4%) of variants
allowed a synthesis including at least one functional variant, 16.4%
(10.5%) allowed a synthesis with at least two functional variants,
and 6.3% (4.1%) could entirely be explained by functional variants.
Thus, formal synthesis, also involving functional variants, is a com—
mon phenomenon.

Next, we investigated the frequency of syntheses for Crohn’s
Disease (CD) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) susceptibility loci. We
took 71 consensus variants for CD (Franke et al., 2010) and 62 for
T2D (Mahajan et al., 2014) from the Burdett,T (EBI). et al. (2014).
Of these variants, 70 CD variants and 60 T2D variants were avail—
able in the 1000 Genomes CEU reference data. For those loci
our method was able to reveal synthesizing sets, we list the respect—
ive rs—numbers, the top set and the correlation coefficient in
Supplementary Table A.

The portion of syntheses, ignoring functional annotations, for
CD, 78.6% (68.6%) and T2D, 80.0% (61.7%), did not differ sig—
nificantly from the proportions observed for random variants
(P > 0.05). However, a substantial increase in the proportion of syn—
thetic associations involving functional variants was observed. After
adjustment for multiple comparisons, five settings showed signifi—
cance. 20.0% (12.9%) of the CD variants allowed a synthesis with
three functional variants at rxb:0.975 (0.995) as compared to a
portion of 6.3% (4.1%) for random variants (P : 1.8 X 10_5 and
P : 7.9 X 104); 42.9% (34.3%) of CD variants allowed a synthesis
with at least two functional variants at rxb: 0.975 (0.995),
P : 2.01 X 10—8 and P : 4.1 X 10*) compared to random vari—
ants. Finally, T2D showed 25.0% synthesis involving at least two

functional variants at rxb:0.995 (P : 5.8 X 104). In summary,
Table 2 shows a significant increase of syntheses involving func—
tional variants for CD and also a respective tendency for T2D sus—
ceptibility loci. This suggests that a portion of these syntheses
potentially reflects the actual functional causes behind the respective
GWAS association signal.

3.3 Examples of associated susceptibility loci for
Crohn's disease and Type 2 Diabetes

We further restricted the syntheses discovered in section 3 for ‘nar—
row—sense’ functional variants, i.e. ‘missense’, ‘nonsense’, ‘stop—loss’,
‘frameshift’ and splice variants (‘splice—3’,‘splice—5’). We discovered
several complete or nearly complete syntheses made up from vari—
ants of those annotation types. In the following we will describe
three examples in detail.

First, rs11564258 is an intron variant of MUC19 (chromosome
12), a CD susceptibility locus (Franke et al., 2010; GWAS Catalog
et al., 2014). Its minor A—allele conveys an odds ratio of 1.73
[1.55;1.95] (Franke et al., 2010). Synthesis analysis revealed twelve
different three—variant functional syntheses for rs1156425 8 with
Ir”) 2 0.99. A list of these sets can be found in Supplementary
Table B. The synthesizing sets overlapped and were made up by a
total of 14 different missense variants, partially reported also in
Kumar et al. (2013). In order to disentangle the LD pattern, we
determined the joint haplotype distribution of the tag variant and all
synthesizing variants.

The respective 15—variant haplotypes with a total length of
138 kb can be found in Supplementary Table C.

The A—allele of the tag variant perfectly tags a single haplotype
of frequency 0.024 which fits the previously reported (Franke et al.,
2010) minor allele frequency of 0.025 for rs1156425 8. While all 14
variants that are involved in the synthesis are missense variants, the
tagged haplotype, marked by the red A—allele of the tag variant, does
not always carry the minor allele of these variants. Under the con—
vention that the minor allele is the missense allele this suggests that
the missense alleles are protective alleles: all further haplotypes carry
at least one of these ‘protective’ alleles and the tag haplotype is char—
acterized by an absence of protective alleles. We note, however, that
the classification into risk and protective alleles is to a large extent a
matter of terminology to describe one of the two sides of a coin. In
any case, it can be stated that rs11564258 risk allele carriers can
fully be characterized by the allele patterns present at 14 missense
variants in MUC19. As shown above, actually various subsets
made of three variants are sufficient to obtain the one—to—one
correspondence.

Second, rs2797685 is an intron variant of PER3 (chr 1), also a
CD susceptibility locus (Franke et al., 2010; GWAS Catalog et al.,
2014). Its minor T—allele conveys an odds ratio of 1.05 [1.01—1.10]
(Franke et al., 2010). Synthesis analysis revealed a manifold of 40
syntheses at Ir”) 2 0.99 with a cardinality between 3 and 6 variants.
The synthesizing sets are given in Supplementary Table B and the
17—variant haplotypes of the joint distribution with a total length of
56 kb can be found in in Supplementary Table D (upper panel).

Third, rs7178572 is an intron variant located in HMG20A (chr
15) which has previously been identified as a T2D susceptibility
locus (GWAS Catalog et al., 2014; Mahajan et al., 2014). Its minor
G—allele conveys an odds ratio of 1.08 [1.04—1.13] (Mahajan et al.,
2014). Synthesis is established by a two—variant haplotype of size
371 kb comprising the missense variant rs1867780 located in
PEAK1 and rs7119 in the untranslated—3’ HMG20A region. In total
synthesis analysis revealed 17 synthesizing sets, which are listed in

Supplementary Table B. All sets include the aforementioned two
variants and between none and two additional missense variants in—
side exons of the genes TBC1D2B, CHRNA5, ADAMTS7 and
RASGRF1. In Supplementary Table E we list the 1 877kb joint nine—
variant haplotypes of the tag and all synthesizing variants. The A—al—
lele of the tag variant perfectly tags a single haplotype of frequency
0.324 consisting of the wildtype alleles of all contributing variants.

3.4 Analysis of CD GWAS

We applied our method to the CD GWAS in order to investigate if
synthetic haplotypes capture the GWAS index association signal.
Since the GWAS is only part of the original discovery samples
(Jostins et al., 2012), the index SNPs listed are typically not genome—
wide significant in the data we present here. However, suggestive as—
sociation is present and consistent with the results in Jostins et al.
(2012).

First, we searched to confirm the syntheses for MUC19 and
PER3 which we had detected using 1000 Genomes reference data.
In the CD GWAS, for MUC 19, we identified a 16—SNP—haplotype,
mostly defined by the same variants as before (Supplementary Table
F). The haplotype is tagged by the minor allele of the GWAS index
SNP rs11564258 (OR : 1.67 [1. 09;2.54]. P : 0.017). The effect
size is in line with that reported by Jostins et al. (2012). The func—
tional haplotype has a frequency of 0.040 in cases and 0.022 in con—
trols (Supplementary Table F), (1.86 [1.21;2.85]. P : 0.007), i.e. its
association signal is even a bit stronger than that of the index allele.
For PER3, we also confirm the finding in 1000 Genomes data and
establish a functional syntheses. The odds ratio of the GWAS index
allele rs2797685—T is virtually identical to that of the synthetic
haplotype (Supplementary Table F).

Next, we searched for further narrow—sense functional syntheses
given by SNP sets with size up to 5. We applied filter settings 3 and
5, which yielded identical results, thus also confirming the usefulness
of the faster setting 3. In addition to the analysis of the 1000
Genomes data, we were able to identify functional syntheses for 6
further CD loci, ZGPAZ, GPR65, CLN3/NPIPB8, LOC102723 878,
LD region around rs2872507 and GCKR. A full description of the
underlying SNPs, haplotypes and association measures can be found
in Supplementary Table F. Three of these genes, ZGPAZ, GPR65
and CLN3/NPIPB8, are also shown in Table 3 and are described in
the following in more detail.

The major G—allele of rs4809330 (ZGPAZ, intron) is associated
with elevated CD risk (Jostins et al., 2012). In our GWAS, the G—al—
lele has a frequency of 0.763 in cases and 0.708 in controls
(Table 3), (OR : 1.32 [1.11; 1.58]. P : 0.0016). The G—allele tags a
5—SNP—haplotype defined by missense variants in the surrounding
genes HELZ2, RTEL1—TNFRSF6B, LIME1 and SLC2A4RG. The
functional haplotype has a frequency of 0.762 in cases and 0.701 in
controls (Table 3), (1.34 [1.13; 1.60]. P : 0.00038), i.e. its associ—
ation signal goes in the same direction as that of the index SNP, but
is stronger.

Next, the minor T—allele of rs8005161 (GPR65, intron), associated
with CD risk (Jostins et al., 2012), has a frequency of 0.119 in cases
and 0.083 in controls, (OR : 1.42 [1.11; 1.81]. P : 0.0050). The
other allele, rs8005161—C(0.70 [0.55;0.90]), tags a 2—SNP—haplotype
defined by missense variants in GALC and GPR65. The functional
haplotype (Table 3) has frequencies and odds ratio virtually identical
to that of rs8005161—C. In addition, the synthesizing variants define a
further, rare haplotype with stronger association signal. R51805078G
—rs3742704c has a frequency of 0.044 in cases and 0.024 in controls
(Table 3), (OR : 1.85 [1.23;2.79]. P : 0.0040).

Finally, rs151181—C (CLN3/NPIPB8) is associated with elevated
CD risk (Jostins et al., 2012). The other allele, rs151181—T, has a
frequency of 0.524 in cases and 0.574 in controls (Table 3),
(0.82 [0.71; 0.95]. P : 0.0114), and tags a 2—SNP—haplotype defined
by missense variants in APOBR and IL27. The functional haplotype
has a frequency of 0.525 in cases and 0.575 in controls (Table 3),
(0.81 [0.72; 0.95]. P : 0.0073). Again, the synthesizing variants de—
fine an additional haplotype, rs180743c — rs147413292c with
stronger association signal (P : 0.0024).

In summary, the synthetic haplotypes always confirm the associ—
ation signal of the GWAS index SNP. Upon analysis conditional on
the synthesizing variants, all index signals vanished (Table 3), indi—
cating that the functional variants simultaneously capture the index

association.

4 Discussion

We presented methods for the search for multi—locus haplotype
markers in near perfect LD with a GWAS tag variant. Such haplo—
type markers fulfil the formal criteria of a synthetic association
(Goldstein, 2009). We suggest and evaluated filtering criteria
which we deducted heuristically from typical examples of synthetic
association presented in Dickson et al. (2010), based on marker al—
lele frequencies and LD measure criteria. Via a simulation study,
we showed that the enormously large space of potentially synthe—
sizing variant sets can effectively be reduced while keeping sensi—
tivity high. Our results were confirmed by the analysis of the CD
GWAS, in which all results that were found with exhaustive search
were also retrievable with filter setting 3 active. In practice, we
recommend exhaustive search for tuples of size up to 5, and filter
setting 3 when larger tuples or multitudes of index SNPs shall be
investigated. As a future plan, we wish to apply our approach to
all known phenotype associations listed in GWAS Catalog et al.
(2014) and to provide a respective data base of functional synthe—
ses of susceptibility loci.

With t1000 Genomes reference data, we found syntheses involv—
ing variants which are as far as 1 Mb, and spanning 2.1 MB in the
most extreme case, away from the tag variant. In this sense, we can
confirm the statement given in Dickson et al. (2010) that synthesiz—
ing variants can be located rather far away from the main associ—
ation peak. Of note, the functional synthesis for the diabetes
susceptibility locus in HMG20A we described also comprised vari—
ants more than 1 Mb away from the tag variant. Syntheses at further
distances were not observed with the real data. Nevertheless, large
window sizes should be chosen when non—human data or regions of
extended LD shall be searched.

Our approach can be applied in a case—control setting as well
as to public reference genotype data. Via analysis of 1000
Genomes reference data and confirmation in our case—control
GWAS, we could demonstrate that syntheses can readily be de—
tected in reference data, without the incorporation of phenotype
information. Sensitivity in reference data, however, may be
reduced, for instance when relevant markers are missing.
Validation and exhaustive search in a case—control setting, there—
fore, is the gold standard.

Our data analysis demonstrated that formal synthesis is a very
common phenomenon in regions of LD. We could further show that
syntheses involving functional variants occur more frequently with
known GWAS susceptibility loci (Crohn’s Disease and Type 2
Diabetes) than with random variants. A limitation of this finding is
that it is not trivial to select an appropriate set of random variants

for comparison, as GWAS susceptibility loci are certainly not ran—
domly distributed in the genome. We note, however, that the enrich—
ment among CD loci is also markedly stronger than that in T2D
loci. Thus, at least for CD the hypothesis of a functional enrichment
is supported. Irrespective of this, the detection of syntheses is of sub—
stantial relevance, whether or not is the result of statistical enrich—
ment, since index allele carriers will typically carry the functional
haplotype of synthesis. Thus, this haplotype will, even in case it
should not be the actual cause of the disease, expose its biological
impact and should at least be acknowledged as a confounding fac—
tor when it comes to the investigation of causality. In this context,
it has to be emphasized that by statistical means alone it will not
possible to ultimately prove causality of a set of variants. In the pres—
ence of near perfect LD between two or more variant or haplo—
type markers any of these might provide causality. Still it is
important to know all syntheses of a susceptibility locus, since they
point to functional variants that are at least primary candidates for
causality.

For, in total, 8 out 70 CD GWAS index SNPs we detected syn—
theses by missense variants. The respective haplotypes showed asso—
ciation signals very similar to that of the GWAS index SNP. In three
cases (ZGPAl, CLN3/NPIPB8, MUC19), the haplotype signal was
more pronounced and lead to improved significance. In the case of
GPR65 and CLN3/NPIPB8, the synthesizing SNPs defined and add—
itional, rare haplotype with an association signal that was stronger
than that of the index SNP and the synthetic haplotype. Thus, syn—
theses may not only explain the GWAS index signal, but provide

additional statistical support for the finding. In view of this, the
search for ‘incomplete’ syntheses should be a future area of investi—
gation: in practice, the GWAS index SNP might only partially cap—
ture surrounding signals. In this sense, GWAS index SNPs which
define full syntheses must be regarded as events fortunate for gene
detection.

In summary, we have shown that the inference of synthetic vari—
ants has the potential to yield additional insight into the biology
underlying hard—to—interpret association signals.

Our methods are implemented in the efficient software tool
GetSynth, which is freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/
getsynthl. The software is written in C/C ++ and requires the binary
genotype files defined by PLINK (Chang et al., 2015; Purcell et al.,
2007) as input format. Filter criteria, set size, function classes and
the number of functional variants that shall be involved in a synthe—
sis can be pre—specified by the user.

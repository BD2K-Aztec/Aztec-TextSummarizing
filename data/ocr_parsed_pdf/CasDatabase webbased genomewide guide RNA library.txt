Abstract

Motivation: CRISPR—derived RNA guided endonucleases (RGENs) have been widely used for both
gene knockout and knock—in at the level of single or multiple genes. RGENs are now available for
forward genetic screens at genome scale, but single guide RNA (ngNA) selection at this scale is
difficult.

Results: We develop an online tool, Cas—Database, a genome—wide gRNA library design tool
for Cas9 nucleases from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9). With an easy—to—use web interface,
Cas—Database allows users to select optimal target sequences simply by changing the filtering
conditions. Furthermore, it provides a powerful way to select multiple optimal target sequences
from thousands of genes at once for the creation of a genome—wide library. Cas—Database also pro—

 

vides a web application programming interface (web API) for advanced bioinformatics users.
Availability and implementation: Free access at http://www.rgenome.net/cas—database/.

1 Introduction

RNA guided endonucleases (RGENs) derived from the Type H clus—
tered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)—Cas
(CRISPR associated) system, an adaptive immune response in bacteria
and archaea, have been usefully harnessed in many genome engineering
applications such as gene knockout and knock—in in various organisms
(Doudna and Charpentier, 2014; Kim and Kim, 2014; Sander and
Joung, 2014; Shalem et (11., 2015 ). Recently, a few groups have under—
taken genome—wide Cas9—mediated genetic screens (Chen et (11., 2015 ;
Gilbert et (11., 2014; Hart et (11., 2015; Koike—Yusa et (11., 2014;
Konermann et (11., 2014; Shalem et (11., 2014; Wang et (11., 2014; Zhou
et (11., 2014) in human and other mammalian cells. The selection of tar—
get sequences is an initial, rate—limiting step in RGEN applications.
We and other groups have developed a number of web—based online
tools or command—line programs for single—guide RNA (ngNA) design

or off—target site identification (Aach et (11., 2014; Bae et (11., 2014a;
Cradick et (11., 2014; Doench et (11., 2014; Heigwer et (11., 2014; Hsu
et (11., 2013; Lei et (11., 2014; Montague et (11., 2014; Naito et (11., 2015;
O’Brien and Bailey, 2014; Park et (11., 2015; Sander et (11., 2010;
Upadhyay and Sharma, 2014; Xiao et (11., 2014; Xie et (11., 2014).
Although they are very useful for choosing ngNAs that target one
gene, selection of ngNAs at the genome scale is still challenging.
Previously, two genome—wide databases for SpCas9 design
(Hodgkins et (11., 2015; MacPherson and Scherf, 2015) have been
built conceptually. However, although they are useful for selecting
ngNAs that target a small number of genes, neither offers an easy
way to select optimal target sequences at once from thousands of
genes for genome—wide library construction in a variety of organ—
isms. Here we describe Cas—Database, a web—based genome—wide
gRNA design tool for SpCas9 nucleases for genome—scale screening

experiments. Cas—Database contains all available targets of SpCas9
nucleases that recognizes 5’—NGG—3’ protospacer—adjacent motif
(PAM) sequences in all coding sequence (CDS) regions throughout
the whole genome of a selected organism, based on the Ensembl
database (Cunningham et (11., 2014). Each target site has the follow—
ing information: GC content, relative cleavage position in the CDS,
constitutive exon coverage, a microhomolgy—associated out—0f—
frame score (Bae et (11., 2014b), and potential off—target sequences
with up to 2—nt mismatches. In addition, JBrowse (Skinner at 111.,
2009) is used to display all available target sites graphically in a
zoomable interface with genomic location information for the user’s
convenience.

Cas—Database basically provides a fast and easy way to select 0p—
timal target sequences in genes of interest from a variety of organ—
isms. Additionally, it offers a powerful way to select optimal target
sequences in many genes simultaneously. Selecting ngNA sequences
that target each gene is as easy as online shopping because of the use
of a ‘cart’ system, similar to what is used in online shopping malls,
which was implemented using cutting—edge web development tech—
niques such as AJAX (asynchronous JavaScript and XML).

Currently, Cas—Database supports ngNA design in 12 different
organisms, including five vertebrates (human, rat, mouse, pig and
zebrafish), one insect (Drosophila melanogaster), one nematode
(Caenorhabditis elegans) and five plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, t0—
mato, banana, grapes and soybean). All processes required to gener—
ate the genome—wide database have now been automated using
a scripts pipeline so that we can easily update information about
the existing organisms or add new organisms to the database.
We are planning to continue to add and support more organisms in
the future.

2 Methods

2.1 Target selection for SpCas9 nucleases

The latest whole genome sequence and associated annotation data
from each organism in the Ensembl database were automatically
retrieved and saved to our server using a homemade program written
in Python language. To allow easy access to the annotation database,
we used the Biomart protocol (Kasprzyk, 201 1; Kasprzyk et (11., 2004)
for communicating with the Ensembl server. After retrieving the gen—
ome sequence and annotation data associated with each organism, we
first searched for all possible targets that contain 5’—NGG—3’ PAM se—
quences in CDS regions and then calculated several characteristics of
each target, e.g. ngNA GC content, relative cleavage position in the
CDS, common exon coverage throughout the various transcripts of
the gene, and a microhomology—associated out—of—frame score.

2.2 Searching for potential off—target sites

After identifying all possible targets for SpCas9 nucleases in CDS re—
gions and calculating the characteristics of each target, we next used
the Cas—OFFinder program (Bae et (11., 2014a) to search for potential
off—target sites that differ from each on—target site by up to 2nt
and that contain 5’—NGG—3’ or 5’—NAG—3’ PAM sequences. Because
this step is very time—consuming, we ran Cas—OFFinder on an
OpenCL—enabled cluster computer such as Chundoong (http://chun
doong.snu.ac.kr/) for all sites in parallel. During this process, we peri—
odically validated that each searching node had finished correctly.
After validation, all Cas—OFFinder output files were retrieved from the
Chundoong server and moved to our local storage site. Then, for each
selected target the total number of potential off—targets was counted;
information about the genomic location of these potential off—targets,

such as whether they reside in CDS, UTR, intron or intergenic regions,
was also evaluated.

2.3 Inserting information into the database

We rearranged all of the resulting data and constructed a SQL data—
base that contains all possible SpCas9 nuclease targets in CDS re—
gions and related characteristics of each target. We chose
PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.0rg/) as the database server,
which showed the best performance in our case.

2.4 Web interface

We built a web interface for Cas—Database using the Python web
framework Django (https://www.djangoproject.c0m/). Because of its
modern and easily—implemented database application program inter—
face (database API), the algorithm for storing and retrieving data from
the PostgreSQL database is simplified and web site maintenance
is easy. For creating the HTML part of the interface, we used the
web development framework Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.c0m/)
and the JavaScript framework JQuery (https://jquery.c0m/). We also
implemented asynchronous data upload and download to achieve a
fast response time for each user using the asynchronous JavaScript
and XML (AJAX) technique. Because the results are retrieved from
the server asynchronously, user requests will be run in parallel rather
than in sequence. In conclusion, searching and filtering functions will
be operated and displayed immediately after a user changes the input
data or filtering condition.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Cas—Database overview

Cas—Database provides a simple and easy way to design optimal
ngNAs. All available genes from a selected organism are listed on
the main page of the Cas—Database website, as shown in Figure 1A.
Users can easily search for desired genes by querying with the gene
symbol, Ensembl ID or gene description. The search results are in—
stantly displayed on the screen after every keystroke through the use
of the AJAX web technique (Fig. 1B).

For a desired gene, users can use the ‘Quick Info’ function or the
‘Add to collection’ function. Basically, the ‘Quick Info’ function is
useful for selecting ngNAs manually for each gene; one can easily
preview all available targets in a specific gene by clicking on the
‘Quick info’ button. Moreover, users can add additional desired
genes—just as items are added to a shopping cart online—and select
ngNAs for many genes simultaneously using the ‘Add to collection’
function. In addition, hundreds or thousands of genes can be im—
ported from text files that contain gene symbols or Ensembl ID lists,
with individual entries separated by line breaks or spaces (Fig. 1C).

3.2 Use of the 'Quick Info’ function

Cas—Database provides an easy way to preview ngNAs that target a
specific gene. Clicking on the ‘Quick info’ button immediately pro—
vides detailed information about the gene, transcripts and targets in
a new dialog box (Fig. 2A—C). Furthermore, the genomic locus of
each target is displayed on the graphical genome browser, JBrowse
(Skinner et (11., 2009) (Fig. 2B). If one clicks on a target in the
browser, the corresponding target (Fig. 2C) will be shown on the
Cas—Database web page for added convenience.

Cas—Database also offers a powerful filtering function. Using the
filtering feature at the top of the web page, as shown in Figure 2A,
users can change the filtering conditions and rapidly preview the
new results.

Fig. 3. The ‘Ouick lnfo' function of Gas-Database. The ‘Add to Collection' function of Gas-Database. (A) Gas-Database provides a unique and easy way to select
many genes at once by the implementation of a ‘cart' system. Users can collect desired genes by clicking on the ‘Add to Collection' button or by uploading a text
file as described in the Figure 1C legend. Note that one can also select genes from different organisms. By clicking on the ‘Select optimal gRNAs' button, users
will proceed to the next step. (B) The results page will list all available ngNAs filtered by the default conditions on the top panel. A colored indicator represents
the selection status for each gene, e.g. green (selected completely), yellow (selected partially) or red (not selected at all). A user can download only the genes for
which ngNAs were successfully designed, and repeat the process for the remaining genes by changing the filter criteria and clicking on the ‘Remove "green"
genes from list' button

Filtering criteria include GC content, relative position in the
CDS, exon coverage throughout all transcript variants of the gene, a
microhomology—associated out—of—frame score (Bae et al., 2014b),
excluding four thymidine nucleotides in tandem (Braglia et al.,
2005) and the number of mismatched nucleotides.

3.3 Use of the ‘Add to Collection’ function
Cas—Database also provides a novel function that allows the selec—
tion of ngNAs from hundreds or thousands of genes at once

through the use of a ‘cart’ system. Users can either collect desired
genes on the main web page by clicking on the ‘Add to Collection’
button (Fig. 3A) or by uploading a text file as discussed above and
shown in Figure 1C. After all desired genes are collected, clicking on
the ‘Select optimal ngNAs’ button will open the results page, which
will list all available ngNAs filtered by the default conditions as
shown in Figure 3B. Users can easily change the filtering conditions,
including the total count of ngNAs for each gene, in the filter sec—
tion that appears at the top of the resulting page (Fig. 3B). Because

the AJAX technique is used, the retrieving processes run independ—
ently of each other, resulting in fast loading speeds; e.g. the loading
time for 1000 genes is about 2 min in the default conditions.

Whether enough ngNAs have been selected for each gene after
filtering is indicated by colored indicators—green (selected com—
pletely), yellow (selected partially) or red (not selected at all), as
shown in Figure 3B. In this step, users can download either se—
quences for all selected ngNAs targeting each gene or for some
ngNAs selected completely from each gene with a green indicator.
In other words, users can download sequences only for genes for
which ngNAs were selected completely under the initial filtering
conditions. After that, users can eliminate genes with green indica—
tors from the list by clicking the ‘Remove green genes from list’ but—
ton, and then can alter the filtering conditions again. After resetting
the filtering conditions, users can download the genes with green in—
dicators again and repeat this process until ngNAs have been se—
lected completely in the most remained genes. Finally, if a few genes
are still left, users can manually select targets for those genes using
the ‘Quick info’ function on the main page. As a result, users can se—
lect optimal ngNAs from hundreds or thousands of genes and
download a list of ngNAs for every gene with the target specific
information.

3.4 Web API

For users familiar with bioinformatics, Cas—Database also provides a
web application programming interface (web API). If users send
queries through hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) requests to our
database server, the results will be returned in the JavaScript oriented
notation (JSON) format. Thus, researchers can easily create their own
simple homemade scripts for automated data retrieval. Details about
the web interface are described in the Supplementary data.

3.5 Update of Gas—Database

The entire process of database creation, from retrieving an organ—
ism’s genome sequence and its associated annotation data from the
ENSEMBL server to creating a new database, is totally automated
by our homemade scripts. The time to build a new database depends
on the organism’s genome size, e.g. the creation of a new database
for zebrafish (1.32 GB) took about three days.

Currently, Cas—Database supports 12 different model organisms,
including five vertebrates (human, rat, mouse, pig and zebrafish),
one insect (D.melanogaster), one nematode (Celegans) and five
plants (At/valiana, tomato, banana, grapes and soybean), and we
are planning to update Cas—Database continuously to obtain the
most recent versions of genomic sequences for the existing organ—
isms. We also plan to add data from other organisms in the
ENSEMBL database. In addition, we will update the database to
allow for alternative CRISPR/Gas nucleases such as Cprf1 (Zetsche
et al., 2015).

4 Conclusion

Cas—Database is an easy—to—use web—based tool for designing
ngNAs for SpCas9 nucleases on a genome scale. It can be applied
to construct optimal ngNA libraries that target thousands of cod—
ing sequences in 12 different organisms for genome—wide knockout
screening experiments. Because Cas—Database contains all available
targets in CDS regions as well as target—related information, includ—
ing data about potential off—target sites, users can easily access the
data through the interactive web interface or web API. The web
interface was made using cutting—edge web development techniques

such as AJAX, so the website is highly responsive to user input and
the output results load quickly.

Abstract

Summary: Copy number abnormalities (CNAs) such as somatically—acquired chromosomal dele—
tions and duplications drive the development of cancer. As individual tumor genomes can contain
tens or even hundreds of large and/0r focal CNAs, a major difficulty is differentiating between im—
portant, recurrent pathogenic changes and benign changes unrelated to the subject’s phenotype.
Here we present Copy Number Explorer, an interactive tool for mining large copy number datasets.
Copy Number Explorer facilitates rapid visual and statistical identification of recurrent regions of
gain or loss, identifies the genes most likely to drive CNA formation using the cghMCR method and
identifies recurrently broken genes that may be disrupted or fused. The software also allows users
to identify recurrent CNA regions that may be associated with differential survival.

Availability and Implementation: Copy Number Explorer is available underthe GNU public license

1 Motivation

Huge volumes of genoniics data from nearly every cancer type are
now freely available and innovative projects such as UCSC Cancer
Genomics Browser (Cline et (11., 2013), cBioPortal (Cerami et (11.,
2012) and arrayMap (Cai et (11., 2015) have begun to collate and
store this information.

Those analyzing cancer copy number data often wish to know
the location of recurrent CNAs in a given tumor type and which
genes are likely to be driving that gain or loss. Additionally, some
may wish to know which genes are recurrently broken as this can in-
dicate a potential tumor suppressor loss or gene fusion. It is, how-
ever, challenging to analyze CNA regions in these ways using
current gene-centric or non-interactive approaches. This is problem-
atic since the presence or absence of a certain CNA can aid in diag-
nosis, stratify patients into different risk categories or inform
therapy decisions.

Copy Number Explorer rapidly generates and displays inter-
active CNA and breakage frequency plots from public data such as
the TCGA or from the user’s own study. The software requires only
segmented copy number data as is generated from popular segmen-
tation algorithms such as DNAcopy (Venkatraman and Olshen,

(C7 The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

2007). Subsequently, it is possible to combine data from different
studies or from an internal database—even if data were generated
using different array designs or next generation sequencing. Here we
demonstrate the utility of Copy Number Explorer by applying it to
the TCGA Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) data (Brennan et (11.,
2013)

2 Implementation

The software is written in R and tested using version 3.0.2. Tier 3
segmented SNP6 array copy number and survival data were down-
loaded fron] the TCGA data portal (https://tcgadata.nci.nih.gov-/
tcga/). The software calculates CNA frequency of every gene in the
human hgl9 RefSeq gene set by assigning it the log2 ratio of the
copy number segment from which it was derived. By default, any
gene whose segmented log ratio is greater than 0.2 is considered
gained and less than 70.2 is considered lost (thresholds are, how-
ever, customizable) and the total number of samples crossing these
thresholds are calculated. Segment Gain or Loss (SGOL) scores are
calculated for RefSeq genes using the SGOL function of the
cghMCR package (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release-/bioc/

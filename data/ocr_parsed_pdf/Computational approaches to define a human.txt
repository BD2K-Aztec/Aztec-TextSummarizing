Abstract

Motivation: The goal of deciphering the human glycome has been hindered by the lack of
high—throughput sequencing methods for glycans. Although mass spectrometry (MS) is a key tech—
nology in glycan sequencing, MS alone provides limited information about the identification of
monosaccharide constituents, their anomericity and their linkages. These features of individual,
purified glycans can be partly identified using well—defined glycan—binding proteins, such as lectins
and antibodies that recognize specific determinants within glycan structures.

Results: We present a novel computational approach to automate the sequencing of glycans using
metadata—assisted glycan sequencing, which combines MS analyses with glycan structural infor—
mation from glycan microarray technology. Success in this approach was aided by the generation
of a 'virtual glycome’ to represent all potential glycan structures that might exist within a metagly—
comes based on a set of biosynthetic assumptions using known structural information. We
exploited this approach to deduce the structures of soluble glycans within the human milk glycome
by matching predicted structures based on experimental data against the virtual glycome. This
represents the first meta—glycome to be defined using this method and we provide a publically
available web—based application to aid in sequencing milk glycans.

(Varki and Lowe, 2009). Unlike the template driven process for syn—
thesizing linear nucleic acids and proteins, glycans are enzymatically
synthesized and are thus products of many genes forming linear and
branched sequences of stereospecific monosaccharides that provide
unique surfaces for protein interactions (Bertozzi and Rabuka,
2009). Understanding the specificity of glycan—binding proteins
(GBPs) provides clues to their functions, and defining specificity is
accomplished by comparing the structures of glycans bound by a

related to a tissue, organ or cell type has been defined. Furthermore
no method is currently available with the requisite precision or speed
to be incorporated into an automated sequencing platform.
Historically, methods for glycan sequencing were developed to ad—
dress different aspects of glycan structure and included purification of
glycans and application of a variety of chemistries to deduce structure

approaches to glycan structure are limited in their ability to fully iden—
tify glycan structure that includes sequence, linkage, and anomericity;
however, a large amount of information is generated from mixtures
of glycans. One example of high—throughput automated annotation of
MS peaks was described in the Cartoonist algorithm (Goldberg et (11.,
2005). The algorithm initially selects annotations from a list of bio—
logically plausible glycans based on a set of archetype cartoons manu—
ally derived from a priori knowledge of the biosynthetic pathways
known to express certain N—glycans. It then assigns a confidence score
to the set of glycan annotations for the most abundant signals. The
annotations represent the composition and topology of the structure
though portions of the structure contain specific monosaccharides
and glycosidic bonds based on constraints imposed by the biosyn—
thetic pathway. A de novo approach, termed STAT (Gaucher et (11.,
2000), predicts glycan structures by generating all possible topologies
of a glycan structure based on the precursor ion mass, charge carrier
and product ion mass from the MSH data. A review (von der Lieth
et (11., 2006) of automated interpretation of MS Spectra for glycan
structures provides an overview of various approaches; however, all
of the existing approaches fall short of fully characterizing glycan
structures including the linkage and anomericity.

In spite of its limitations, MS techniques, especially those that in—
clude more laborious multistage MS (Ashline et (11., 2014a) have
proven extremely useful in doing the deep sequencing required to
fully define a glycan structure. However, a method for high through—
put, deep sequencing of glycan structure will likely require a com—
bination of techniques. Defined glycan microarrays provide a high—
throughput approach for identifying epitopes on individual glycans
when interrogated with GBPs that bind known glycan determinants.
Although the determinant or epitope alone cannot provide the infor—
mation needed to fully characterize the glycan structure, it does pro—
vide ‘metadata’ that can be applied to reveal the structure. We
developed Metadata—Assisted Glycan Sequencing or MAGS as a
structural approach that combines MS data with glycan microarray
data (Smith and Cummings, 2013), and recently demonstrated its
utility in defining over 20 novel structures among the human milk
glycans (HMGs) (Ashline et (11., 2014b; Yu et (11., 2014). The glycan
microarray data used in this approach is acquired from libraries of
relatively pure glycans, analogous to a shotgun glycan microarray
(SGM) (Song et (11., 2011) where glycans, representing a selected gly—
come, are ﬂuorescently derivatized, and separated by multidimen—
sional chromatography to resolve isomeric structures and obtain
relatively pure components in a tagged glycan library. The separated
glycans are then printed as a SGM comprising the selected glycome.
We reasoned that MAGS could be used as a general approach to de—
fine any glycome that could be presented as a SGM; however, man—
ual analysis of the data generated from hundreds of glycans in a
microarray would be a tedious process. We therefore developed a
software package, termed GlycomeSeq, to sequence HMGs through
automated meta—analysis of experimental data based on our MAGS
(Smith and Cummings, 2013) approach.

We reasoned that a key to more automatable sequencing is to
create a ‘virtual glycome’ comprising all theoretical structures, and
then test the predicted structures from the obtained metadata
against this virtual glycome; we also used a novel algorithm to filter
candidate glycan structures through this knowledge base to arrive at
a single structure consistent with all available information. For this
study, we selected the free glycans of human milk, since the glycans
are easily accessible and a large literature is available about them. In
addition to the nutritional disaccharide lactose (10—15g/l), human
milk contains a complex mixture of larger, free oligosaccharides or
glycans (5—10 g/l) that are not efficiently metabolized in the stomach

of the neonate and reach the intestines where they are thought to
have probiotic activity (Bode, 2012), as well as to provide protection
against pathogens by interfering with adhesion of pathogens to in—
testinal epithelial cells as ‘decoy receptors’ (Jantscher—Krenn et (11.,
2012; Kuhn et (11., 2008; Ruiz—Palacios et (11., 2003; Yu et (11., 2014).
Milk glycans have also been implicated in having beneficial innate
immune and immunomodulatory effects (Duska—McEwen et (11.,
2014), decreasing colon contractility (Bienenstock et (11., 2013) and
promoting gut epithelial cell maturation (Holscher et (11., 2014;
Kuhn et (11., 2008; Ruiz—Palacios et (11., 2003). Recent studies on the
biological functions of human milk have indicated that breast fed in—
fants have soluble milk glycans circulating in blood at detectable lev—
els suggesting potential systemic effects of such glycans (Goehring
et (11., 2014). The structures and quantities of the free glycans in
human milk vary widely among individual mothers based on their
genetics, which controls the expression of the human Lewis blood
groups and time of lactation (Bode, 2012). A variety of factors inﬂu—
ence the repertoire of the human glycome, including genetics, envir—
onment, and time (or conditions of synthesis); and like the human
genome, the glycome of the human milk free glycans is an ‘average
set of structures’ that represents all of the possible structures that
could exist at any one time or in any one individual. Thus, there is
great interest in defining the human milk metaglycome and its com—
ponents, since they may differ in many ways between different sour—
ces and the overall repertoire of glycans in a milk sample is subject
to many variables. The computational approach developed here was
successful in identifying glycan structures within the human milk
metaglycome and the approach should be applicable to other cellu—
lar and tissue metaglycomes.

2 Methods

In prior studies related to the current development we developed a
functional glycomics approach using a SGMs of human milk (Yu
et (11., 2012, 2014), in which the SGMs are interrogated with viruses
and antibodies that recognize unique glycan determinants. We also
used defined lectins and antibodies before and after specific exogly—
cosidases to obtain detailed information about the repertoire of gly—
can determinants in individual glycans within the library. These
data generated large quantities of metadata on each glycan; we then
used logic to arrive at a structural solution based on the identifica—
tion of specific determinants by antibody and lectin binding (Yu
et (11., 2014). However, the manual data processing to arrive at
structures was extremely time consuming, and we reasoned that an
algorithm could be used to apply the logic generated from the struc—
tural information and specificity of glycosyltransferases available
from previous studies on milk glycans. If this could be accomplished
as an automated, high—throughput method, it could be applicable as
a general approach to defining a human metaglycome.

To address the human milk meta—glycome and to develop an
automated system for MAGS, we used data available from the SGM
from 10 different donors with mixed blood groups (Yu et (11., 2014),
and selected data from the analysis of 42 HMGs and 14 standards
(Supplementary Table S1). This included 33 glycans whose struc—
tures were predicted by manual analysis of MALDI—TOF data, anti—
body and lectin binding data, and MSU analysis (Ashline, et (11.,
2014b; Yu et (11., 2014). In this article, we describe the approach to
developing an automated system for MAGS, and we show how
automated analysis of multiple modalities can enrich the set of pre—
dicted structures for an unknown glycan target by introducing the
concept of a ‘virtual glycome’ of human milk free glycans as a

knowledge base and an algorithm for filtering candidate structures
from the virtual glycome.

2.1 Generating the virtual human milk soluble glycome
Based on previous studies of human milk soluble glycan structures and
the specificities of enzymes involved in their synthesis, we established
a set of biologically plausible rules that can be used to define all of the
possible structures synthesized as free glycans in human milk without
regard to differential genetics or stage of lactation (see Supplementary
Material A). These rules can then be used to computationally generate
and store all possible glycan structures including structural isomers
into a database. Seeking to establish a general method to generate a
virtual glycome, we developed a novel approach using regular expres—
sions (REs) to represent the biosynthetic rules for a particular metagly—
come. For our initial attempt, we focused solely on the human milk
soluble glycome and we describe the method below.

The Virtual Glycome Generator algorithm is initialized with the
core lactose structure, a threshold parameter for the maximum core
size of the glycome, and the patterns that represent the extensions
and terminal modifications of HMG biosynthesis. The actual repre—
sentation of the extension and terminal modification patterns is
declared using REs as described in Supplementary Figure S1. A RE is
a sequence of symbols or characters (also known as a string) that
represent a set of patterns that describe regular languages from
Formal Language Theory. Common applications of REs include val—
idating email addresses in a web form, replacing or extracting values
in a text file, UNIX shell commands such as ls or grep etc. REs can
use operators and meta—characters to express non—trivial patterns of
strings including repeating characters, optional characters and
classes of characters. In our Virtual Glycome Generator algorithm,
we are interested in the class of regular languages that are star—free,
such that the language described is finite but also supports the
union, disjunction and finite repetition of patterns. For example, ra—
ther than using the Kleene Star operator (i.e. ""’), the RE must be
bounded by a minimum and maximum range (i.e. ‘{0,1}’).

An RE is typically used to check for a match between an input
string and a pattern. In our case, we are interested in generating all
the input strings that can possibly represent a pattern. This turns our
problem into the question of how can we generate all the possible
strings (or glycan structures) that match a given RE? From the field
of Automata Theory, we know we can use a Finite—State Automaton
(FSA) to implement a RE. An FSA recognizer starts in an initial state
and transitions to other states based on the sequence of symbols
from the input, and if the automaton is in an accepting state when
the input terminates, then it is said to accept the input, thus repre—
senting a match against the RE.

Since we are actually interested in generating output from the
FSA, we reasoned we could simulate the automaton to output all pos—
sible strings that would be accepted by the FSA. We used a non—recur—
sive backtracking algorithm to find all possible accepting states. The
algorithm accumulates the input characters for each transition until
reaching an accepting state; when it outputs the resulting string to an
array. We used the Linear Code nomenclature (Banin et (11., 2002) to
represent the set of symbols for the monosaccharides, anomericity,
linkages and branches to define the REs. We describe the full algo—
rithm to generate the virtual glycome in Supplementary Material B.

The set of glycan structures generated by this algorithm repre—
sents the ‘virtual glycome’ for human milk free glycans and is used
as the knowledge base for glycan structure prediction. Since glycans
commonly form branched structures, we utilized Extensible Markup
Language (XML) as the format to store generated glycan structures

in the virtual glycome database. XML has the advantage of support—
ing hierarchical queries using the XML Path Language (XPath).
XPath is analogous to a SQL query used to query records from a re—
lational database though XPath provides a mechanism to query and
navigate through hierarchical representations of data, a feature that
is well suited for branched glycan structures and utilized extensively
in the candidate glycan filtering step described in the ‘Glycan
Structure Prediction’ method.

2.2 Glycan structure prediction

The GlycomeSeq algorithm requires a spreadsheet input file
(Supplementary Material C) that contains the composition and gly—
can array binding data for each glycan target. The composition,
determined by MS, of the glycans are reported based on the number
of hexose (H) residues, which are the single reducing terminal
Glc plus Gal (the only hexoses found in human milk free glycans);
N—acetylhexosamine (N), which is only GlcNAc; deoxyhexose (F),
which is only Fucose; and Sialic Acid (S), which is only Neu5Ac. For
example, the composition of the glycan, Neu5Acoc2—3Gall31—
3(Fucoc1—4)GlcNAc[31—3Gal[31—4Glc, is H3N1F1S1; and the core
structure (without Fucose and Sialic acid additions) would be
H3N1.We proceed through the steps of the algorithm below.

As illustrated in Figure 1, the algorithm initially selects all struc—
tures from the database that match the composition of the unknown
target. We then evaluate the positive binders and select the intersec—
tion of candidate structures from the remaining set of structures that
contain the determinant for the positive binding GBPs. The selection
of the candidate structures that contain the determinant is based on
an XPath query defined for the GBP. Each of the XPath queries is
defined in Supplementary Material C.

Next, for each non—binding GBP, we filter out candidate struc—
tures that contain the determinant for each non—binding GBP using
an XPath query. This step is completed for all negative binders to
eliminate candidate structures for that target. Finally, if we have
additional determinants as identified by MSn reporter ions (e.g. lin—
ear lactose, branched lactose, terminal fucosylated LacNAc etc.) we
select the intersection of candidate structures in our final set of pre—
dicted structures.

Core Structures, which are unsubstituted with fucose or sialic acid as indicated by the designation FOSO in the top row, are designated by composition where H
represents hexose (a single reducing terminal glucose and galactose residues) followed by the number of residues; i.e. H2 is the lactose core structure (GalBl-

GlcNAc. The composition H2N1 was included to be comprehensive, but this structure is not found as a free glycan in human milk (see Supplementary Material
A). The numbers for each composition indicate the number of isomers with the indicated composition that can be biosynthetically generated in human milk based
on the rules described in Supplementary Material A. For example, the composition H5N3F251 is shared among 140 isomeric structures in the virtual glycome.

questions of how many possible free glycans can exist in human
milk, and how many of these structures may be biologically rele—
vant. Although the number of possible structures of HMGs may be
well over 50 000 and depend on individual genetics, time since initi—
ation of lactation, diet and possible time of day, the number of bio—
logically relevant terminal determinants may be <100. The free
glycans of human milk may, therefore, present a cluster or bouquet
of thousands of individual structures where these biosynthetic path—
ways may have evolved to support a relatively limited number of
biologically relevant determinants. By this unique biological process
the microheterogeneity within a metaglycome is less important than
the total number of relevant determinants expressed.

3.2 GlycomeSeq algorithm

The GlycomeSeq algorithm has been implemented in a software
package that executes within a web application (http://glycomeseq.
emory.edu). It takes an input file in a format described in
Supplementary Material C; however, the example on the website is
preloaded with the data from Supplementary Material C and the
web application is available at http://glycomeseq.emory.edu. In our
initial study, we have focused only on the neutral free glycans of
human milk. The data used for demonstrating our automated
sequencing approach were obtained from the validation of the HM—
SGM reported previously (Yu et al., 2014). The data from 11 GBPs
With known specificities binding to 42 purified HMGs and 14
standards of known structure before and after treatment with the
specific exoglycosidases, [31—3—galactosidase, [31—4—galactosidase and
0:1—2—fucosidase and endo—[31—4—galactosidase are shown in
Supplementary Table S1. The determinants (subset of a glycan struc—
ture containing di— to pentasaccharides) identified by defined GBP
binding are shown in Supplementary Figure 2.

The application outputs a table with the predictions for each tar—
get and the associated metadata (see http://glycomeseq.emory.edu).
To assist with the interpretation and derivation of the results, the ap—
plication includes explanations for predicted structures and candi—
date structures that were ruled out as predicted structures due to
filtering from the negative binders. Each predicted structure includes
the metadata that was used to include it in the final result. For ex—
ample, Figure 3, which is an excerpt from the application output of
http://glycomeseq.emory.edu, shows the results of GlycomeSeq ana—
lysis of HMG—20 where the prediction is a single structure and three
‘Ruled out Candidates’ are listed.

pure glycans. Using manual application of the MAGS logic, we lim—
ited the application of the algorithm to glycan targets that we deter—
mined to be single structures. The mass calculation limits the
selection of only one composition for each glycan target, and the
presence of more than one structure is obvious since the GBP—bind—
ing data will discover an excess of determinants for a single compos—
ition. Using these criteria, we determined that nine targets were
mixtures of two to five glycans. The algorithm returned single re—
sults for 20 of the glycans. Of the remaining 13 targets analyzed,
three glycans (HMG—38, —39 and —42) were not found in the data—
base of all human milk free glycans (virtual glycome) and could,
therefore, not be returned as single structures. The structures with
no predictions are a result of the metadata identifying a positive
‘anti—H type 2’ determinant (Fucoc1—2Gall31—4GlcNAc) and a posi—
tive Lewis Y determinant [Fucoc1—2Gall31—4(Fucoc1—3)GlcNAc] in
their structures, which would indicate that the unknown target con—
tains a substructure that is inconsistent with the biosynthetic rules
(absence of H—type 2 glycans) we used to generate the virtual milk
glycome (Supplementary Material A). Thus, the algorithm as cur—
rently written permits us to identify exceptions to the biosynthetic
rules and raises questions for further experimentation.

In 10 instances the algorithm generated multiple candidate struc—
tures. In these cases, there was no indication of excess determinants
indicating that these targets were mixtures. Reporting two or more
possible structures indicates that metadata to distinguish between
two structures are missing. For example, in HMG—23 (see
Supplementary Table S2) the internal Lewis x determinant in the ac—
tual structure (Yu et al., 2014) cannot be detected by any currently
known antibody or lectin, and the algorithm has not been suffi—
ciently refined to identify fragment ions indicating the location of
the internal Lex determinant in the structure, and in addition there
is no known, specific GBP that can distinguish between a linear and
a branched glycan. Therefore, using the available binding data and
the knowledge base, the algorithm returned the three possible struc—
tures (two linear and one branched) among all isomers of that com—
position that were consistent with available data. One of the
predicted structures was the correct one. If such GBPs were available
or if an appropriate fragment ion were identified and added to the
knowledge base, the algorithm would be able to return the correct
prediction

In most cases, we used sequential MSn analysis to confirm all of
the structures in the array including targets comprised of multiple
glycans as shown in Supplementary Table S2, which summarizes the
predictions for each glycan based on the data from the analysis of
42 HMGs and 14 standards selected for analysis. The structures of
glycan targets HMG—9, —19, —36, —3 8, —39, —40, —42, —46, —59 and —64
were confirmed for this report and a description of the structural
analysis is provided in Supplementary Material D and
Supplementary Table S2. The others had been confirmed in a previ—
ous description of HMGs that bound rotavirus adhesion proteins
(Ashline et al., 2014a; Yu et al., 2014).

4 Discussion

In the current studies, we developed a novel computational ap—
proach to address the fundamental question regarding the size of the
human milk free glycan meta—glycome and if structural information
and metadata can be combined to facilitate high—throughput
sequencing of glycans. Predictions as to the number of different gly—
cans that can exist in human milk have varied from a few hundred
to many thousands. In our study, we applied a novel approach to

address that question as shown in Table 1 where we estimated that
number of HMGs limited to a core structure no larger that a dodec—
asaccharide could be ~53 000 structures. Obviously, no single indi—
vidual will produce all possible glycans because the structures
synthesized will depend on many factors including, the genotype,
time after initiation of lactation, time of day, and nutrition state of
the donors. Nevertheless, it is clear that many thousands of different
glycans are synthesized and secreted into the milk of all human
mothers. Thus, modern computational approaches as developed
here are essential to help identify and characterize the complex
metaglycomes of human milk.

We hypothesized that a bioinformatics approach for structural
analysis that combines the knowledge of a database of fully charac—
terized glycan structures and experimental metadata from glycan
microarrays and MS analysis would be able to automate the
sequencing for the human milk meta—glycome. This approach is
summarized in the algorithm GlycomeSeq (Fig. 2), and as shown in
Supplementary Table S2, GlycomeSeq was able to identify all of the
standards on the array that were found in the database of all human
milk free glycans (virtual glycome). The algorithm correctly pre—
dicted no structures for ‘Agal LNT’, ‘LNFP IV’ (H2) and ‘Ley—Lex’
since they do not occur in human milk. GlycomeSeq was able to
identify a single prediction in the unknown glycan targets in 20 out
of 33 cases, and in all cases drastically reduced the number of candi—
date glycans from the large numbers of possible isomers in each
composition. Structures of the glycan targets were confirmed or
determined by independent structural methods and were in agree—
ment with the predicted structures from GlycomeSeq.

Generally, where the algorithm produced multiple predictions
for a target, there may not be enough meta—data available to elimin—
ate candidate structures or the data indicates a binding motif should
be present but is actually missing in a candidate structure. Such in—
stances may occur due to weak binding, cross—reactivity of GBP for
a target glycan, steric effects that prevent detection of a determinant
that actually exists in the target, or insufficient data quality. For ex—
ample, glycan HMG—76 with composition H6N4F2S0 has 291 pos—
sible structures in the virtual glycome. GlycomeSeq predicted two
structures and all those contained determinants for the GBPs and
the MSH reporter ions. Neither of the two predicted structures was
ruled out during the negative binder filtering—step. In spite of not
being able to generate a single predicted structure, the algorithm
was able to eliminate all but 2 candidate structures from the 291
possible isomers with this composition. Such information is invalu—
able to analysts using mass spectrometry (MS) to define this glycan
target and facilitates more targeted MS techniques to distinguish
isomers.

The current state of the art approach for automated glycan
sequencing is through techniques that automatically interpret MS
data. However, these methods and tools are still evolving. Methods
vary from (i) matching theoretical peak lists to the mass spectra
(Joshi et al., 2004), (ii) matching mass spectra to a database of
experimentally determined spectra (Kameyama et al., 2005)
(iii) de novo sequencing approaches that match mass spectra to the—
oretical peak lists from structures that are constrained by biosyn—
thetic pathways (Gaucher et al., 2000; Goldberg et al., 2005; Hu
et al., 2014; Lapadula et al., 2005) and (iv) the GlycoWorkbench
and Glyco—Peakfinder, a semi—automated annotation tool to assist
the manual interpretation of MS data (Ceroni et al., 2008; Maass
et al., 2007). All of these approaches are limited by their ability to
perform complete structural characterizations that detect linkage
position and anomeric configurations, meaning that the predicted
glycan structures are ambiguous in certain aspects. Based on our

Computational approaches to deﬁne a human milk metaglycome

current review of the literature, GlycomeSeq is the only automated
high—throughput sequencing method that can predict fully character—
ized glycan structures including topology, linkages and anomeric
configurations.

We also found that the number of terminal determinants that are
found in human milk free glycans increase sub—linearly as a function
of core structure size. This raises the possibility that the large num—
bers of isomeric structures represent a type of scaffold upon which
specific determinants are created to provide necessary biological
functions. From the analysis in Figure 2 we observe that as the num—
ber of monosaccharides in the core structures of the glycans in—
creases, the number of terminal determinants increases, which is
consistent with the greater branching that can occur in the larger
glycans. Interestingly, the number of tetra— and pentasaccharide de—
terminants seems to reach a constant number at a core structure of
an octasaccharide, suggesting that free milk glycans up to octasac—
charides may represent the biologically relevant set of glycans in
human milk. These observations also suggest that the free glycans in
human milk present a repertoire of structures that present biologic—
ally relevant determinants, and that individual structures are less im—
portant that the ‘bouquet’ of determinants.

Adding orthogonal methods as metadata to GlycomeSeq en—
hances the predictive power of our method. The reporter ions from
MSn analysis provide conclusive structural information for frag—
ments in the unknown target structure. For example, HMG—76 has
two reporter ions inferred from the MSH analysis; if we eliminate the
fragments from our input then the algorithm predicts 47 structures
from the binding data alone. Similarly, if we only use the reporter
ion fragments from MS, GlycomeSeq predicts 10 structures. By com—
bining the GBP binding data with the MS fragment data; the algo—
rithm generates 2 predicted structures out of 291 possible structures.

5 Conclusion

We describe herein an approach to define a virtual meta—glycome
and use it as a knowledge base to predict fully characterized glycan
structures using data from MS and glycan microarray—binding ex—
periments. This approach to computational sequencing of the un—
known glycans requires (i) determination of the glycan composition
using MALDI—TOF analysis, (ii) interrogation of the glycans with
lectins and antibodies that bind known determinants, (iii) determin—
ation of the set of predicted structures based on automated meta—
analysis of the experimental data from the virtual glycome database
given the constraints of the rules for the biosynthetic pathway of the
glycans. Although several methods have been aimed at glycan anno—
tation of mass spectrometric analysis, to our knowledge no other
method has been developed that attempts to solve the glycan struc—
ture to the level of GlycomeSeq. This approach has the potential to
be a significant breakthrough in glycomics analysis that has thus far
been hindered by the complexity and ambiguity of MS analysis. We
seek to make improvements and have planned future work for our
approach including (i) automate the analysis of the MS spectra to
identify the MS reporter ion determinants, (ii) develop a library of
XPath queries for the determinants so the user does not have to
manually specify them in the spreadsheet, (iii) include exo— and
endoglycosidases to yield finer specificity and (iv) apply this method
on HMGs with Sialic Acid to further validate this approach before

moving onto a much larger meta—glycome.

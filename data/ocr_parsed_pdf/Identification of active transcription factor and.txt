ABSTRACT

Motivation: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative
disease of the central nervous system that may be caused by perturb-
ation of regulatory pathways rather than the dysfunction of a single
gene. However, the pathology of AD has yet to be fully elucidated.
Results: In this study, we systematically analyzed AD-related mRNA
and miRNA expression profiles as well as curated transcription factor
(T F) and miRNA regulation to identify active TF and miRNA regulatory
pathways in AD. By mapping differentially expressed genes and
miRNAs to the curated TF and miRNA regulatory network as active
seed nodes, we obtained a potential active subnetwork in AD. Next,
by using the breadth-ﬁ rst-search technique, potential active regulatory
pathways, which are the regulatory cascade of TFs, miRNAs and their
target genes, were identified. Finally, based on the known AD-related
genes and miRNAs, the hypergeometric test was used to identify
active pathways in AD. As a result, nine pathways were found to be
significantly activated in AD. A comprehensive literature review
revealed that eight out of nine genes and miRNAs in these active
pathways were associated with AD. In addition, we inferred that the
pathway hsa-miR-146a—>STAT1—>MYC, which is the source of all
nine significantly active pathways, may play an important role in AD
progression, which should be further validated by biological experi-
ments. Thus, this study provides an effective approach to finding
active TF and miRNA regulatory pathways in AD and can be easily
applied to other complex diseases.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the developed countries, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the sixth
leading cause of all deaths. Deaths attributable to AD have been
increasing dramatically, whereas other major causes of death
have been decreasing (Thies and Bleiler, 2011). In addition,
AD is one of the most costly diseases for society (Holt et al.,
2009; Thies and Bleiler, 2011). However, the molecular

mechanism of AD is not fully clear. It is thought that many
factors and their interactions contribute to the pathogenesis of
AD (Ikonen et al., 2003; Lahiri et al., 2004; Xia et al., 1997).
Thus, advanced research regarding the mechanism of AD is of
great importance.

With the emergence of molecular networks, such as proteini
protein interaction networks (PPINs) and transcription regula-
tory networks, many studies initially focus on topological
properties when analyzing network organization, architecture
or evolution. However, most existing studies are based on
PPINs and transcription regulatory networks and do not inte-
grate important post—transcriptional regulation.

miRNA is a type of short non-coding RNA that participates
in post-transcriptional gene regulation. By binding to target
mRNAs with partially complementary sequences, it causes trans-
lational repression or target degradation (Bartel, 2004, 2009).
Studies have increasingly shown that miRNA is closely asso-
ciated with the onset and development of complex human dis-
eases (Li et al., 2012), such as cancer (Meltzer, 2005), diabetes
(Kantharidis et al., 2011) and neurodegenerative disease (Junn
and Mouradian, 2012). With increasing research on AD, many
studies have shown that miRNAs are important players in the
development of AD. For example, Wang et al. found that miR-
107 expression levels decreased significantly, even in patients who
were in the earliest stages of pathology. Wang et a]. (2008) fur-
ther indicated that miR-107 may cause AD through the regula-
tion of BACEl. A recent study by Shioya et a]. (2010) found that
the underexpression of miR-29a affected neurodegenerative pro-
cesses by enhancing neuronal NAV3 expression in AD brains.
In addition, Hebert et a]. (2008) characterized a miRNA cluster
miR-29a/b-1 that was signiﬁcantly and speciﬁcally downregu—
lated in AD patients, and found that the loss of miRNA
increases BACEl and A5 expression levels in AD. These findings
suggest that aberrant miRNA expression is strongly related to
AD. In addition, miRNA and transcription factor (TF) do not
function in isolation. Chen et a]. (2011) found that the coordi-
nated regulation of TF and miRNA may be involved in various
biological processes, and the disruption of this coordination may
lead to cancer. Thus, integrated analysis of transcriptional and
post-transcriptional regulation could provide a comprehensive
regulatory map for the etiological study of complex diseases.

In recent years, gene expression profiles have been taken into
account during network analysis to identify the underlying mech-
anisms of complex diseases. Ruan et a]. developed a general

Identification of active transcription factor and miRNA regulatory pathways

 

coexpression network-based approach to discovering network
modular structures that was effectively applied to the study of
the pathological mechanisms underlying lymphoma (Cho et al.,
2011; Ruan et al., 2010). Vaske et a]. (2010) presented a method
for predicting the activities of curated pathways from the
Pathway Interaction Database in glioblastoma multiform and
breast cancer by considering gene coordinate expression and
the correlation between copy number and gene expression in
the same pathway. In addition, much effort has been devoted
to identifying the active subnetworks or modules in diseases from
large molecular networks. For example, Ideker et a]. (2002) pro-
posed a method for screening a molecular interaction network
that contained proteiniprotein and proteiniDNA interactions to
ﬁnd active subnetworks. A scoring system was implemented to
capture the degree of change in gene expression. A search algo-
rithm based on simulated annealing was used to identify the
subnetwork with the highest score. Gene expression differences
between normal and disease samples were interpreted as the de-
gree of gene activation. Backes et a]. (2012) exploited the same
‘active’ concept to find the deregulated subnetwork in the regu-
latory network of KEGG using an integer linear programming
approach. Gaire et a]. (2013) extracted the active subnetwork in
the network that consists of protein interaction network and
gene regulatory network by applying a mixed integer program-
ming model. However, ﬁnding the subnetwork or module that
is signiﬁcantly related to a disease state is still challenging.
Compared with coexpression networks, curated pathways and
complex subnetworks, the regulatory pathway, which presents
a cascade of regulators and target genes, is easily elucidated
and validated by biologists. From disease-related pathways, we
may ﬁnd key factors that are located upstream of the pathway
and that participate in multiple pathways. The activation of key
factors may be the cause of disease onset. Thus, identifying active
regulatory pathways is crucial for dissecting the pathology of
complex diseases. Keller et a]. (2009) presented an algorithm
for detecting differentially regulated paths (pathways) from a
given biological network based on gene set enrichment analysis.
However, they did not consider genes whose expression level
were not detected by microarray technology and restricted the
length of paths (pathways).

In this study, we identiﬁed active transcriptional and post-
transcriptional regulatory pathways in AD based on AD-related
mRNA and miRNA expression profiles as well as miRNA and
TF regulation. To obtain stable AD signatures [differentially
expressed (DE) genes], we used a meta-analysis to analyze mul-
tiple AD-related gene expression proﬁles. In addition, a breadth-
ﬁrst—search (BFS) approach was applied to ﬁnd potential active
TF-miRNA regulatory pathways that may contain non-DE
genes. Finally, the signiﬁcance of all of the potential pathways
was evaluated by a hypergeometric test based on known AD-
related genes and miRNAs. The identified pathway had a simple
network structure and an easy interpretation that could feasibly
be validated by biological experiments. Our study thus provides a
novel insight into the causes and mechanisms of AD.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

We proposed a novel approach to identify active TF-miRNA regulatory
pathways in AD. Firstly, we detected consistent differentially expressed

genes (CDEGs) by applying a meta-analysis to multiple gene microarray
datasets. The differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) were derived
from one miRNA expression proﬁle. Secondly, by mapping the CDEGs
and DEmiRs to the curated TF-miRNA regulatory network as active
seed nodes and connecting the active seed nodes with their immediate
neighbors, we obtained the potential active TF-miRNA regulatory sub-
network in AD. Thirdly, by using a BFS algorithm, we identiﬁed all of
the directed acyclic paths between O-indegree nodes, where the indegree is
0, and O-outdegree nodes, where the outdegree is 0, which were deﬁned as
potential active TF-miRNA regulatory pathways in AD. Finally, known
AD-associated genes and miRNAs were mapped to potential active path-
ways. Through the hypergeometric test, we identiﬁed the active
TF-miRNA regulatory pathways that were signiﬁcantly related to AD.
An overview of the approach is shown in Figure 1.

2.1 AD—related mRNA expression proﬁles

AD is a complex disease, and different brain regions exhibit diverse gene
expression patterns (Liang et al., 2007). However, several studies have
suggested that some important common features may be shared among
different AD brain regions. Liu et a]. (2010) detected crosstalk and dys-
function in AD-related pathways in multiple brain regions of AD patients
and identiﬁed common dysfunctions. Using a microarray dataset on six
AD brain regions (GSES281), Liang et a]. (2012) identiﬁed a signiﬁcantly
perturbed subnetwork in each brain region and found that these
perturbed subnetworks signiﬁcantly overlapped with each other. In
this study, to obtain stable and consistent AD gene signatures, we down-
loaded 4 AD-related mRNA expression proﬁles (GSE16759, GSE12685,
GSE1297 and GSES281) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database (Edgar et al., 2002). All of the data were normalized and log
2 transformed (details in Supplementary ﬁle Sl). For each expression
proﬁle, probe sets were mapped to Entrez Gene IDs. If multiple probe
sets corresponded to the same gene, then the expression values of these
probe sets were averaged. Genes that appeared in all of the expression
proﬁles were considered in the analysis. The microarray datasets com-
prise nine case-control studies (Supplementary File SI and S2) according
to different experiments and brain regions, which were further analyzed
by the meta-analysis.

2.2 DEmiRs in AD

Because high-throughput techniques have thus far rarely been used to
investigate miRNA expression in AD, we only obtained one miRNA

microarray dataset from GEO (GSE16759), in which Nunez-Iglesias et al.
(2010) detected both miRNA and mRNA expression in AD patients and
controls. They identiﬁed 48 DEmiRs at the false discovery rate (FDR)
level of 0.05 by the empirical Bayes procedure.

2.3 Curated TF and miRNA regulatory network

The TF and miRNA regulatory network was constructed by integrating
ﬁve curated data resources: TRANSFAC (Wingender et al., 2000),
TransmiR (Wang et al., 2010), miRTarBase (Hsu et al., 2011),
miRecords (Xiao et al., 2009) and TarBase (Sethupathy et al., 2006).
The curated human TF-gene regulations were derived from the
TRANSFAC database (version 11.4). The curated human TF-miRNA
regulations were obtained from the TransmiR database (version 1.2). The
curated human miRNA-gene regulations were obtained from the union
of miRecords (version 3), TarBase (version 5.0) (excluding the FALSE
support type of the miRNA-gene interactions) and miRTarBase data-
bases (release 2.5). All curated regulations were supplied in the
Supplementary File SS. Within the curated regulatory network, all of
the redundant edges were collapsed into a single edge, and all of the
self-directed edges were pruned from the network.

2.4 Known AD—associated genes and miRNAs

The known AD-associated genes were derived from the GeneCards data-
base (Safran et al., 2002). The disease genes presented in GeneCards were
extracted from multiple databases that included known disease-associated
genes. The known AD-associated miRNAs were derived from HMDD
(Lu et al., 2008) and the miR2Disease database (Jiang et al., 2009). Both
of these databases manually collected the associations between miRNAs
and diseases from published studies.

2.5 Meta-analysis

Different gene expression proﬁles may produce different DE genes.
To obtain stable gene signatures, we used a meta-analysis (Ramasamy
et al., 2008) to identify CDEGs through a combination of nine case-
control studies. The detail description of meta-analysis was provided in
Supplementary File S]. In this study, we used the SMVar (J affrezic et al.,
2007) method to detect DE genes in each case-control study. The meta-
analysis was implemented by using the R package metaMA (Marot et al.,
2009).

2.6 Identiﬁcation of a potential active TF—miRNA
regulatory subnetwork in AD

Previous studies have shown that disease genes do not always show dif-
ferential expression in microarray experiments, which indicates that some
disease-related key genes could lurk among non-DE genes (Nitsch et al.,
2009; Zhao et al., 2011). As a result, we hypothesized that the CDEGs,
DEmiRs and their immediate neighbors in the curated TF-miRNA regu-
latory network potentially contributed to the pathology of AD. We
mapped the CDEGs and DEmiRs into the regulatory network as
active seed nodes and connected them with their neighbors to produce
the potential active TF-miRNA regulatory subnetwork.

2.7 Identiﬁcation of potential active TF—miRNA
regulatory pathways in AD

A subnetwork often has a complex structure, even if it is distilled from
the original background network. These complex connections impede
the interpretation and validation of the subnetwork of interest. In this
study, we focused on regulatory pathways, which were the paths
connected to multiple TFs, miRNAs and target genes in the curated

TF-miRNA regulatory network. Identifying the active regulatory path-
ways in AD not only uncovered transcriptional and post-transcriptional
regulatory cascades but also shed light on the molecular mechanisms
of AD.

From the potential active TF-miRNA regulatory subnetwork, we iden-
tiﬁed all directed acyclic paths from O-indegree nodes to O-outdegree
nodes. The gene/miRNA with a O-indegree cannot be regulated by
other regulators, which indicates that it is located upstream of the regu-
latory pathway. Similarly, the gene/miRNA with a O-outdegree does not
regulate other genes/miRNAs, which means that it is located downstream
of the regulatory pathway. The upstream genes/miRNAs are important
because their activation could cause a cascade effect that results in the
alteration of downstream gene/miRNA expression and leads to AD.
Thus, by searching all of the pathways/paths between O-indegree genes/
miRNAs and O-outdegree genes/miRNAs, we could ﬁnd key upstream
genes/miRNAs in the regulatory pathways. To accomplish this task, the
potential active subnetwork was treated as a directed graph. Firstly, we
used BFS algorithm to traverse all vertexes in the graph. Secondly, based
on the results of graph traversal, backtracking method was used to
extract all paths from O-indegree nodes to O-outdegree nodes. The
pseudo-code for ﬁnding the pathways is described in Supplementary
File S].

For the example graph in Figure 2, we can identify all of the directed
acyclic paths between the O-indegree node and the O-outdegree node.
They are 1—>2—>4—>7, 1—>2—>4—>8, 1—>2—>5—>8 and 1—>3—>6—>9.

In this study, the directed acyclic paths with more than 2 nodes were
considered to be potential active regulatory pathways, in which there was
at least one DE node and no more than one non-DE node or node
without expression values between the two DE nodes.

2.8 Evaluation of potential active TF-miRNA regulatory
pathways in AD

Here, we deﬁned a coverage rate (CR) of known AD-associated genes

and miRNAs in the potential active pathway to measure the strength of

the relationships between the potential active pathway and AD.
CR was calculated as

CR——
NT

where ND represents the number of known AD-associated genes and
miRNAs in the pathway, and NT represents the total number of genes
and miRNAs in the pathway.

Next, we used the hypergeometric test to evaluate the statistical sig-
nificance of the CR value. A low P-value indicates that the observed CR
value is unlikely to occur by chance and the pathway exhibits a greater
than expected trend toward participating in AD.

Identification of active transcription factor and miRNA regulatory pathways

 

3 RESULTS
3.1 DE genes and miRNAs

By using a meta-analysis to combine nine case-control micro-
array studies (Supplementary Table S1), we identiﬁed 1872
CDEGs at the FDR level of 0.01.

Nunez-Iglesias et al. obtained 48 DEmiRs by applying the
empirical Bayes method to miRNA expression profiles in AD
patients and normal controls (Nunez-Iglesias et al., 2010). In the
present study, 29 DEmiRs that were recorded in the miRBase
database were used.

3.2 Potential active TF—miRNA regulatory subnetwork
in AD

By integrating ﬁve databases (TRANSFAC, TransmiR,
miRTarBase, miRecords and TarBase) that address transcrip-
tional and post-transcriptional regulations, we constructed the
curated TF—miRNA regulatory network, which included 411
TFs, 387 miRNAs, 2300 target genes and 6036 regulations
(Fig. 3A). We mapped the 1872 CDEGs and 29 DEmiRs to
the curated TF—miRNA regulatory network and set them to be
active seeds. Next, we constructed the potential active TF-
miRNA regulatory subnetwork by connecting all of the active
seeds with their immediate neighbors (Fig. 3B). The subnetwork
comprised 127 TFs, 195 miRNAs, 649 target genes, and 1206
edges, in which 343 genes and 16 miRNAs were DE.

3.3 The active TF-miRNA regulatory pathways in AD

We used the BFS approach (see ‘Materials and Methods’ sec-
tion) to find all of the directed acyclic paths from 0-indegree
nodes to 0-0utdegree nodes in the potential active TF-miRNA
regulatory subnetwork. As a result, 14 644 paths with more than
two nodes were obtained, and these paths were regarded as the
potential active TF—miRNA regulatory pathways in AD, which
comprised 641 genes and miRNAs. The length of all of the
potential active pathways ranged from 3 to 16, and the average
was 6.99.

In addition, we derived 27 known AD-associated genes from
the GeneCards database (Safran et al., 2002) and 45 known AD-
associated miRNAs from the HMDD database (Lu et al., 2008)

and miRNAs

and miR2Disease database (Jiang et al., 2009) to evaluate the
signiﬁcance of the identiﬁed potential active pathways. There
were 29 AD-associated genes and miRNAs mapped in the
potential active pathways. The CR of the known AD-associated
genes and miRNAs of the potential active pathway was used to
measure the strength of the association between the potential
active pathway and AD. Next, we identified the signiﬁcantly
active pathways using a hypergeometric test (see ‘Materials and
Methods’ section). The potential active pathways with P < 0.0005
were considered to be the active TF—miRNA regulatory path-
ways in AD. As a result, we identiﬁed nine active pathways.
Moreover, we further adjusted P—Values for multiple testing
using FDR and found that the FDR of the nine pathways are
less than 0.2 (Table 1). The union of the nine active pathways is
Visualized in Figure 4, and identical nodes of the active pathways
were merged.

We validated the active pathways from three aspects. Firstly,
we tested the extent to which the elements in all of the active
pathways appeared in the set of known AD-associated genes and
miRNAs using the hypergeometric test. There were 29 known
AD-associated genes and miRNAs in the potential active regu-
latory pathways, which comprised 641 genes and miRNAs. And
there were 18 genes and miRNAs in all of the active pathways,
which included nine known AD-associated genes and miRNAs.
As a result, the elements in all of the active pathways signiﬁcantly
enriched the set of known AD—associated genes and miRNAs
(P2788 x 10—9). However, this result may not be surprising
because the known AD-associated genes and miRNAs have
been used to investigate the significance of potential active path-
ways. Thus, we further evaluated the active pathways through
the curated AD pathway (hsa05010) from KEGG (release 65.0).
We applied miRPath V2.0 (V lachos et al., 2012) to find miRNAs
that signiﬁcantly regulate the hsa05010 pathway (P< 0.01).
Altogether, all potential active regulatory pathways and all
active regulatory pathways include 17 and 4 genes and
miRNAs that are associated with hsa05010 pathway, respect-
ively. As a result, the hypergeometric test P—Value is
8.29 x 10—4, which indicates that the genes and miRNAs in our
identiﬁed active pathways signiﬁcantly associated with the
known AD pathway. Finally, through a literature review, we
found that eight out of the nine remaining genes and miRNAs
are closely related to AD (Table 2). Here, we could not ﬁnd any
direct evidence to support an important role of protein kinase C
alpha (PRKCA) in AD. However, Barton et al. (2004) showed
that the PRKCA gene was associated with multiple sclerosis,
which is a common inflammatory disease of the central nervous
system and presents some similarities to AD. Our results indicate
that PRKCA might exert an effect through hsa—miR-146a regu-
lation in AD. Additionally, we also found some regulatory inter-
actions in active pathways were relevant to AD. For example,
two regulations of SP1—>APOE and SP1—>MPO appear in the
active pathways. The polymorphisms in the promoter regions of
the two target genes influence the SP1 regulations in AD.
Maloney et al. (2010) demonstrated that two SNPs (A-491T
and G-219T) in APOE promoter region have signiﬁcant associ-
ation with instance of AD. They also proposed that SP1 is the
candidates for regulatory control of the two polymorphic sites.
Leininger-Muller et al. introduced that the G allele of G-463A
MPO polymorphism is associated with a higher level of MPO

and could be overrepresented in AD subjects (Leininger-Muller
et al., 2003). Previous study also demonstrated that the G-463A
is in the promoter region of MPO, and the A allele rather than G
leads to a decreased MPO expression by destroying a SP1 bind-
ing site (Piedrafita et al., 1996). A5 is a peptide of 3&43 amino
acids that is processed from the amyloid precursor protein (APP)
and is expressed in many tissues and concentrated in neuronal
synapses (Krishnappa, 2011). It is commonly known that the
accumulation of A5 peptides could lead to the formation of

amyloid plaques in the brain parenchyma, which is considered
to be a key step in the pathogenesis of AD (Ramberg et al.,
2011). Therefore, understanding the processing of APP is crucial
for development of AD therapeutics. However, little is known
about the mechanisms that contribute to A5 accumulation in
sporadic AD. Here, we identified two active TF—miRNA regula-
tory pathways in AD that included APP (Table 1 and Fig. 4).
Proteolytic processing of APP at the 5 site is essential for gen-
erating A5. BACEl, which is the major 5-secretase involved
in cleaving APP, has been identiﬁed as a type 1 membrane-
associated aspartyl protease. Christensen et al. (2004) found
that the TF SP1 plays an important role in processing APP
to generate A5 in Alzheimer’s disease through regulation of
BACEl. miRNAs can regulate gene expression at the post-
transcriptional level. Hebert et al. (2008) investigated miRNA
expression changes in AD patients and found that a loss of
hsa—miR-29b could increase the BACEl expression level, which
indicated a potential causal relationship between the expression
of hsa—miR-29b and the accumulation of A5. As mentioned
above, all of these factors affect APP processing by targeting
BACEl. Hebert et al. also found that hsa-miR-15a were
significantly altered in AD brain and predicted that has-miR-
15a regulates APP (Hebert et al., 2008). This regulation of hsa-
miR-15a—>APP appeared in the active pathways. In this study,
our results suggest an alternative possibility for the regulation of
A5 levels through cascade regulatory pathways.

Our results conﬁrmed that the disease-related genes and
miRNAs did not always present aberrant expression and that
non-DE genes and miRNAs may be key players in the disease.
In addition, our method can also be used to find key regulators
for which there is no expression information.

Considerable evidence supports the conclusion that neuroin—
ﬂammation is associated with AD pathology (Tuppo and Arias,
2005). Lukiw et al. (2008) suggested that NFKB-sensitive miR-
146a-mediated modulation of the expression of the CFH gene,
which is an important repressor of the inﬂammatory response of
the brain, may have an impact on AD. Kitamura et al. (1997)
indicated that increased expression of NFKB and STAT1 in cell
nuclei may be involved in inflammatory activation in AD brains.

Ferrer and Blanco (2000) detected the expression of MYC
protein by using western blot and single and double-labeling
immunohistochemistry in AD, and found that increased expres-
sion of MYC in reactive astrocytes most likely plays a role in
reactive astrocytosis in human neurodegenerative disorders.

Table 1 and Figure 4 show that hsa-miR-146a—> STATl
—>MYC is located upstream of the regulatory cascade and is

the source of nine active pathways. The activation of this source
could cause the emergence of a cascade effect and result in dis-
ordered expression of downstream genes and miRNA. Thus,
hsa—miR- 146a may be a potential drug target for disease therapy,
and the pathway hsa—miR-146a—>STAT1—>MYC may have a
crucial role in AD that should be further validated by biological
experiments.

4 DISCUSSION

The dysregulation of miRNAs, a type of key post-transcriptional
regulators, has been found in many diseases, such as cancers and
AD. In this study, we proposed a novel approach to identify
active TF—miRNA regulatory pathways by integrating AD-
related mRNA and miRNA expression profiles and transcrip-
tional and post-transcriptional regulation. The pathways we
identified could help to provide biological insights in AD and
could feasibly be validated by biological experiments. We defined
the DE genes and miRNAs as active seed nodes in the curated
TF-miRNA regulatory network. To incorporate regulators with-
out aberrant expression or expression values, we constructed a
potential active subnetwork by connecting the active seed nodes
with their immediate neighbors. Next, the BFS method was used
to ﬁnd the potential active regulatory pathways. Finally, based
on the known AD-related genes and miRNAs, we used the
hypergeometric test to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the associ-
ations between potential active pathways and AD. As a result,
we identiﬁed nine active TF—miRNA regulatory pathways that
were signiﬁcantly related to AD. All of the regulators and target
genes in these active pathways had direct literature support,
except for PRKCA. We also found two active pathways that
may contribute to the accumulation of A5 peptides and the

formation of amyloid plaques in the brain parenchyma, which
are key steps in the pathogenesis of AD. In addition, the pathway
hsa-miR-146a—> STAT1—>MYC appeared in all nine active path-
ways and was the source of the cascade regulation. Thus, we
inferred that the pathway hsa-miR-146a—> STAT1—>MYC may
have a crucial role in AD progression, which should be further
validated by biological experiments.

Our study provides an effective approach to identifying active
TF—miRNA regulatory pathways and a novel insight into the
pathogenesis and development of AD. However, the regulation
between miRNA and mRNA is complex, as suggested by the
miRNA sponge model, which is a new type of miRNA-mediated
post-transcriptional regulation (Sumazin et al., 2011). Many stu-
dies have suggested that miRNA sponges play important roles in
the occurrence and development of diseases, such as autoimmune
inﬂammation (Zhu et al., 2012), innate and adaptive immune
responses (Ma et al., 2011) and spinal motor neuron develop-
ment (Otaegi et al., 2011). Integrating miRNA-mediated
RNAiRNA interactions is helpful for constructing more com-
prehensive regulatory networks. Our approach is ﬂexible to ana-
lyze the integrated networks. With the increase in available
miRNA expression proﬁles for AD and the accumulation of
validated miRNA regulations, our results will become more pre-
cise. In addition, the approach was general and could be applied
to other complex diseases.

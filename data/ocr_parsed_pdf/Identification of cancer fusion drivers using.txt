Identification of cancer fusion drivers

 

all partnerships of known fusion gene pairs. In this analysis,
nodes were fusion partner genes and edges represented partner—
ships between fusion partner genes. The constructed gene fusion
network showed a scale—free topology. However, this analysis did
not address the problem of prioritizing fusion drivers. Another
study developed a computational method to nominate fusion
drivers by assessing the association of their partner genes with
the identiﬁed biological concepts (i.e. gene sets with speciﬁc bio—
logical functions) (Wang et al., 2009). This method, similar to the
aforementioned single gene—based approaches, only accounted
for the impact of a single gene. A recent study (Vandin et al.,
2011) proposed a multiple gene—based approach to identify
groups of proteins that are potential cancer drivers. However,
this approach is not speciﬁcally developed for identifying fusion
drivers.

To address the problem, we here propose fusion centrality
method for prioritizing fusion drivers in network context. We
ﬁrst test whether gene fusions are associated with exon/domain
shufﬂing by enrichment analysis of protein domain co—occur—
rence and protein domain4lomain interactions between protein
domains of known cancer fusion partner genes. We then pro—
posed a domain—based fusion model, assuming that the potential
impact level of a fusion in a network would be associated with all
the protein domains or biological interactions of its two partner
genes. The model leads to the hypothesis that a fusion is more
likely to be an oncogenic driver if its corresponding partner genes
are involved in extensive biological interactions (i.e. hub genes in
a network). We then test this hypothesis using a network cen—
trality analysis on known cancer fusion partner genes, and then
led to the development of fusion centrality, a multiple gene—based
network metric, to prioritize driver fusion genes from passengers.
We evaluated the performance of the fusion centrality model by
a comparison with other single gene—based methods. Finally, we
applied the fusion centrality approach to 38 newly discovered
cancer fusions.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources

A total of 289 known fusion gene pairs and 109 genes with point muta-
tions that have been proven to be causally linked to oncogenesis were
downloaded from the Cancer Gene Census database (Futreal et al., 2004)
for analysis. We also downloaded a curated human gene network from
Pathway Commons (Cerami et al., 2010), consisting of 11 570 genes and
>1 000 000 molecular interactions, for network centrality analysis of these
fusion partner genes and point mutation genes.

Two types of protein domain data in humans are used for the analysis
of domain shufﬂing in gene fusion. One is protein domain co-occurrence
relationships. The UCSC Genome Browser (Fujita et al., 2011) provides
data on Pfam domain families for protein-coding genes. Any two
domains are considered to have a co-occurrence relationship if they co-
exist in at least one protein. In all, we identiﬁed 5135 domain co-occur—
rence relationships among 4412 Pfam domains involving 12864 genes.
The other is a set of 26 219 curated domaindomain interactions among
5410 Pfam domains involving 14936 genes (Yellaboina et al., 2011).

2.2 Fusion centrality

Centrality measures that are normally associated with one node in a
network have been used to determine hub genes in a network (Section

S1 of the Supplementary Material). These measures have been used to
identify genes related to cancer and other diseases (Barabasi et al., 2011).
However, these methods are not able to measure network centrality of a
fusion. In this study, we hypothesized that the importance of a fusion in a
network would be associated with all biological interactions of its partner
genes (Section 3.2). Based on this hypothesis, we quantify the importance
of a fusion based on the new concept of fusion centrality. A new node in a
network, representing fusion between two existing nodes (i.e. the two
partner genes in a fusion), inherits all the linkages of the two nodes
when it is ﬁrst created, but those replicated linkages with other nodes
are ignored. We then postulate that the centrality of the new node rep-
resents the importance of a fusion between two nodes in a network. Thus,
it is intuitive to consider the deﬁnition of degree centrality of a fusion in
terms of total linkages (by ignoring those replicated linkages with other
nodes) of its two partner nodes in a network. More precisely, the fusion
degree centrality of a fusion i (FCDi) between partner genes p and q in a
binary network is deﬁned as:

FCD,» = Z max(aN-, a”) (1)
j:1

where n is the total number of genes in the network, and am (aw) repre-
sents the binary linkage between gene p(q) and gene j in a binary network.

In a weighted network (e.g. the constructed gene network in
Section 3.3), where the linkages among nodes have weights assigned to
them, similarly, we deﬁne the fusion centrality of a fusion 1' (FCW,-) be-
tween genes p and q in terms of the total weight of the connections of gene
17 and q:

1 ’1
F W,» = 7 ‘ -, ‘ - 2
C "gmaxwm WW) ( )
where Wm (wily) represent the weighted linkage between fusion partner
gene 17 (q) and gene j in a weighted network.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Domain-based fusion model

Based on exon shufﬂing theory (Gilbert, 1978), rearrangement of
exons would result in novel genes that encode different proteins
with different functional domains. Several studies have provided
supporting evidence of a strong correlation between protein do—
mains and exon organization (Kaessmann, 2002; Liu and
Grigoriev, 2004). We hypothesized that fusion mutations in
cancer are associated with exon and domain shufﬂing. Because
most biological processes are ultimately executed by proteins, we
focused on domain shufﬂing for in—frame cancer fusion. To test
our hypothesis, we analyzed the enrichment of protein domain
co—occurrence relationships and domainidomain interactions
between 289 known cancer fusion gene pairs (Section 2.1).

Any two domains are considered to have a co—occurrence
relationship if they co—constitute at least one protein. These re—
lationships can represent complex domain combinations in the
human proteome. A set of 5135 known protein domain co—oc—
currence relationships from the protein domains of 12864 genes
(Section 2.1) was used for the analysis. We found that 32.21% of
the 289 cancer fusion gene pairs had known co—occurrence rela—
tionships between their domains. In contrast, only 6.66% of all
the pairs from the 12 864 genes (the background ratio) were
found to have co—occurrence relationships between their do—
mains. Thus, a highly signiﬁcant over—representation of domain
co—occurrence was observed among the protein domains of the

We also applied the ConSig method (Wang et al., 2009), yet
another single—gene based network method, denoted M3.
ConSig score was calculated for each gene by considering its
association with the identiﬁed biologically important concepts.
A fusion is nominated as a driver if one of its partner genes has a
high ConSig score. Therefore, in this method, we used the max—
imum value from the ConSig scores of a benchmark gene pair to
represent the importance of a fusion generated by the pair.
ConSig scores of all human genes were downloaded from
(http://consig.cagenome.org/).

The ROC curves and area under curve values for all methods
are shown in Figure 5. A higher area under curve value in a
method meant that fusions generated by the positive gene pairs
tended to have higher fusion centrality than those generated by
the negative gene pairs. These results indicate that M1 outper—
formed the other two methods. As comparing M1 and M2, it
seems that M2 has a comparable performance as M1. This indi—
cates single gene—based method can provide moderately good
prediction owing to the fact that at least one of partner genes
of cancer fusion is a hub gene. However, a high true—positive rate
is preferred to the ﬁxed lower false—positive rate in a screening. In
the partial ROC area with high true—positive rate and low FDR,
we found that M1 signiﬁcantly outperformed M2. Nevertheless,
this result further conﬁrms our hypothesis that the importance of
a fusion in a network should be evaluated by considering both of
its partner genes. Moreover, M2 performed better than M3. Both
M2 and M3 are single—gene based models but were generated
using data of the constructed gene network and ConSig scores,
respectively. This implies that the constructed network (Wu
et al., 2010) contained more critical pathway information than
the concept signature method (Wang et al., 2009).

3.4 Application of newly discovered fusion drivers

To further evaluate the performance of our fusion centrality
method, we applied Equation (2) to newly discovered fusions.
We selected 38 such fusions, 33 of which had validated oncoge—
netic importance and five of which were highly recurrent in
cancer samples. To identify potential fusion drivers, we first set
a threshold value on fusion centrality using the set of 1000 000
randomly selected gene pairs as a control. We found that the

Fig. 5. Prediction performance comparison of fusion centrality (M1) and
other methods using ROC curve

fusion centralities of the top 7% of these 1000000 pairs were
>0.370, whereas the fusion centralities of 73% of the 289 known
cancer fusions were >0.370 (Table 1). We therefore set the
threshold value to 0.370 for identifying potential fusion drivers
in the proposed fusion centrality method. Table 2 only lists the
fusion centrality values of 10 of these 38 new fusions (the full
information of the 38 fusions is shown in Supplementary Table
Sl). Of these, 34 fusions had a weighed fusion centrality value
larger than or very closer to the threshold value. In all, 29 of
these 34 fusions have been conﬁrmed to have oncogenic import—
ance experimentally. The other four of these new fusions,
JAZFl-SUZl2, CRTC1-MAML1, R3HDM2-NFE2 and
ALG5—PIGU, had fusion centrality values that were much smal—
ler than the threshold value. Among them, JAZFl—SUZl2 and
CRTC1—MAML1 have been associated with lower grade cancer
subtypes (Lee et al., 2012). We thus suspect that R3HDM2—
NFE2 and ALG5—PIGU may also be associated with lower
grade cancer subtypes. These results indicate the ability of the
proposed fusion centrality method to identify fusion drivers.
Notably, our fusion centrality approach also predicted several
fusions with partner genes whose biological roles in oncogenesis
are not well—known. For example, little is known about biolo—
gical roles of microtubule—associated serine/threonine kinase
(MAST) proteins, and their somatic alterations just recently
were discovered in cancer (Robinson et al., 2011). Expression
of these MAST fusions has shown a proliferative effect, both
in vitro and in vivo (Robinson et al., 2011). Our approach

Identification of cancer fusion drivers

 

identified all MAST fusions as driver fusions (i.e. all MAST fu—
sions with >0.38 fusion centralities). Another is the fusion of
vesicle—associated membrane protein (VAPB) with IKZF3
(IKAROS family zinc finger 3) in breast cancer, whose fusion
centrality in our analysis was 0.376. RNA interference—mediated
knock—down of the VAPB—IKZF3 fusion gene revealed its im—
portance to the growth and survival of breast cancer cells
(Edgren et al., 2011).

In addition, Lee et a]. (2012) identiﬁed fusions between 14-3-38
(YWHAE) and either of two nearly identical FAM22 family
members (FAM22A and FAM22B) in endometrial stromal sar—
coma. In contrast to classic endometrial stromal sarcoma that
harbors JAZFl—SUZl2 genetic fusions, tumor cells with
YWHAEiFAM22 fusions displayed high—grade histologic fea—
tures, including larger and more irregular nuclei, increased mi—
totic activity, a distinct gene—expression proﬁle, and a more
aggressive clinical course (Lee et al., 2012). Interestingly, fusions
YWHAEiFAM22A and YWHAEiFAM22B have fusion cen—
tralities of 0.375 and 0.368, respectively, in our predictions,
whereas JAZFliSU212 has a much lower fusion centrality,
0.353. This result suggests that our approach can predict the
relative importance of fusion mutations well.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work, we have proposed the concept of fusion degree
centrality, which measures the local impact of a fusion gene
through its direct connections in a network. The fusion degree
centrality, however, is somewhat biased toward those genes that
were studied more in literature. Therefore, false negatives could
be an issue because some of the genes important for cancer pro—
gression may not be predicted by the method because little is
known about their function, and there is little connectivity be—
tween these genes and others in the network. For example, some
bottleneck hub genes (Yu et al., 2007) with only a few direct
connections to other nodes, but that act as key connectors in
the network. This problem can be addressed by developing of
other kinds of fusion centrality metrics that are able to measure
the global network impact of a fusion, such as fusion between—
ness centrality or fusion eigenvector centrality, using the same
concept we proposed here. For example, after creating a fused
node of two nodes, the fusion betweenness centrality of a poten—
tial fusion generated by these two nodes in a network is repre—
sented by the betweenness centrality of the fused node, which can
be calculated using several existing algorithms. However, in these
algorithms, the calculations of the shortest paths between all
pairs of nodes in a network are time consuming and have to
occur once for each fused node when applying the algorithms
to multiple fusions because a fusion between two nodes in a
network may shorten paths between other node pairs.
Therefore, faster algorithms are needed to efficiently calculate
these fusion centrality measurements for a large number of
fusions detected in next—generation sequencing.

The locations of the fusion or breakpoints and the assessment
of the directionality to the gene components allowed us to cat—
egorize different types of fusions, such as in—frame fusions and
out—of—frame fusions. Although the proposed domain—based
fusion model was developed based on in—frame fusions, the
proposed fusion centrality method can also be applied to

out—of—frame fusions because an out—of—frame fusion mutation
can be considered the deletion of its two partner genes. More
speciﬁcally, if the reading frame is not retained across the fusion
junction, it will likely lead to the production of a premature stop
codon and degradation of the transcript. An out—of—frame fusion
can silence one allele of its two partner genes and be associated
with haploinsufﬁciency or loss of heterozygosity. Therefore, the
potential impact of an out—of—frame fusion in a network would
also be associated with all biological interactions of its two part—
ner genes if the other alleles of the partner genes are lost as well.

A number of studies have identiﬁed that different fusion mu—
tations can be generated when the partner genes are identical but
the breakpoints different (Baxter et al., 2002; Hernandez et al.,
2002; Robinson et al., 2011). For example, genomic analysis of
three TFG—ALK rearrangements in anaplastic large cell lymph—
omas revealed that the TFG breakpoints occurred at introns 3, 4
and 5, respectively, whereas the ALK breakpoints always
occurred in the same intron (Hernandez et al., 2002). Based on
our proposed approach, we suggest that all three fusions would
have the same level of potential impact in a network, no matter
where their breakpoints are located. Interestingly, the study of
Hernandez et a]. (2002) revealed that TFG may use a variety of
intronic breakpoints in ALK rearrangements, generating fusion
proteins with different molecular weights but similar transform—
ing potential. This finding seems to support our view. However,
we need to emphasize that our fusion centrality method is used to
roughly estimate the tendency of a fusion mutation to be an
oncogenic driver in a network, not to estimate its real impact
on cellular function.

A critical issue in detecting fusions from sequencing data is the
high false—detection rate. False detections may be caused by ex—
perimental artifacts, genome assembly errors or the mis—mapping
of end sequences (Bashir et al., 2008; Shah et al., 2009; Wang
et al., 2009). To date, most of the bioinformatics methods de—
veloped for fusion discovery in sequencing data use multiple
steps of false—positive filtering (Kim and Salzberg, 2011;
McPherson et al., 2011a, b; Sboner et al., 2010). Although apply—
ing these filters may reduce the false—positive rate, the false—nega—
tive rate would increase, and consequently, some fusion drivers
would not be detected (McPherson et al., 2011a). Our fusion
centrality method is an alternative way to reduce the false—nega—
tive rate when detecting fusion drivers. For example, potential
fusion drivers that fail to pass ﬁlters but have high predicted
fusion centrality may be kept for further investigation.

Although the gene functional network used in this work was
constructed without accounting for tissue speciﬁcity, the results
presented in this work suggest that a single gene functional net—
work can be used to identify fusion mutation drivers in diverse
types of cancer. Several studies also successfully applied a single
gene functional network to predicted tissue—speciﬁc disease genes
and phenotypic effects of gene perturbation (Lee et al., 2008;
Torkamani and Schork, 2009; Wu et al., 2012). Besides, fusion
drivers of a speciﬁc type of cancer may also be identified by
associating their partner genes with known cancer genes or path—
ways in the cancer type. For example, by extending the concepts
in Equations (1) and (2), the importance of a fusion in a network
can be calculated as the sum of the direct functional associations
of its two partner genes with those known cancer genes or
pathways.

We also applied the centrality analysis to over 1000 cancer
chimeric transcripts and fusion genes collected in ChiTaRS data—
base (Frenkel—Morgenstem et al., 2013), and conclude the same
result as that of using the original 289 fusion gene pairs set
(Supplementary Material Section S4). Besides, we also used
thirty—two highly recurrent chimeric RNAs that were detected
in 20 human prostate cancer samples and 10 matched benign
prostate tissues (Kannan et al., 2011) to validate the performance
of our fusion centrality approach. Many of these chimerics RNA
also appeared in matched benign tissues owing to a ‘ﬁeld effect’
within the histologically normal epithelium. They non—paramet—
ric KolmogoroviSmirnov test was used to determine which chi—
meric RNAs are signiﬁcantly enriched in cancer tissues. We
hypothesized that some of enriched chimeric RNAs would be
fusion drivers and thus have high fusion centrality in our predic—
tion. Indeed, we found most of chimeric RNAs that are signiﬁ—
cantly enriched in human prostate cancer (P<0.05) tended to
have higher fusion centrality than those insigniﬁcantly enriched
chimeric RNAs. These results are detailed in the Section SS of
the Supplementary Material.

Finally, it is important to note that the fusion centrality
method was constructed based on the available data of biological
networks that are far from complete. Genes that have not been
characterized to date but may be important in cancer progression
will not be identiﬁed by our fusion centrality approach because
little of their functions are known. This limitation applies to all
network—based approaches (Barabasi et al., 2011), but our
method will be improved overtime, as more data are generated
and are integrated to construct a more complete gene network in
the future. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the method of
fusion centrality is an efficient method for identifying novel
fusion drivers.

5 CONCLUSON

In summary, all results in this work indicate that the fusion cen—
trality method is a systematic and effective method for prioritiz—
ing fusion drivers from hundreds or thousands of fusion
candidates identified in diverse cancer types. To our best know—
ledge, this is the ﬁrst network—based approaches to nominate
fusion drivers.

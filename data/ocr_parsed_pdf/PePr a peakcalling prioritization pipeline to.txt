ABSTRACT

Motivation: ChlP-Seq is the standard method to identify genome-
wide DNA-binding sites for transcription factors (T Fs) and histone
modiﬁcations. There is a growing need to analyze experiments with
biological replicates, especially for epigenomic experiments where
variation among biological samples can be substantial. However,
tools that can perform group comparisons are currently lacking.
Results: We present a peak-calling prioritization pipeline (PePr) for
identifying consistent or differential binding sites in ChlP-Seq experi-
ments with biological replicates. PePr models read counts across the
genome among biological samples with a negative binomial distribu-
tion and uses a local variance estimation method, ranking consistent
or differential binding sites more favorably than sites with greater
variability. We compared PePr with commonly used and recently pro-
posed approaches on eight TF datasets and show that PePr uniquely
identifies consistent regions with enriched read counts, high motif
occurrence rate and known characteristics of TF binding based on
visual inspection. For histone modification data with broadly enriched
regions, PePr identified differential regions that are consistent within
groups and outperformed other methods in scaling False Discovery
Rate (FDR) analysis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel
sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is the standard technique to identify the
genome-wide occurrences of transcription factor (TF) binding
sites and histone modiﬁcations in vivo. Over the past few years,
there has been tremendous development of analysis methods for
ChIP—Seq data, with tens of ‘peak finders’ published (Blahnik
et al., 2010; Boyle et al., 2008; Fejes et al., 2008; Jothi et al.,
2008; Kornacker et al., 2012; Qin et al., 2010; Rashid et al.,
2011; Rozowsky et al., 2009; Song and Smith, 2011; Valouev

et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2010; Zang et al.,
2009; Zhang et al., 2008). Over this course, several characteristics
of ChIP—Seq datasets, such as enrichment profile features (peak
width, signal-to-noise ratio and location relative to genomic fea-
tures) of different types of TFs and histone modiﬁcations,
sources of artifacts and the commonly observed statistical distri-
butions of read counts, have been gradually revealed (Park, 2009;
Pepke et al., 2009; Rye et al., 2011).

As sequencing cost decreases, use of biological replicates is
emerging and may eventually become the standard practice for
ChIP—Seq studies. Most of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements
(ENCODE) consortium data were performed in duplicate
(Landt et al., 2012). Furthermore, as researchers shift from per-
forming ChIP—Seq experiments that address mechanistic ques-
tions to those that hypothesize differential and/or context-
speciﬁc binding in a disease, treatment or epidemiologic setting,
the use of replicates to account for individual variability becomes
crucial. We expect that this will lead to more analyses comparing
a group of ChIP samples with a group of controls, or two groups
of ChIP samples, with or without controls, run under different
experimental conditions.

ChIP—Seq peak ﬁnders that perform direct group comparisons
within the peak-calling pipeline are currently lacking. When
biological replicates are available, researchers may choose to com-
bine the replicates (CR) in each group and run one-ChIP—versus—
one-control analysis to identify all possible peaks. Alternatively,
they can pair ChIP and control samples, conduct a separate ana-
lysis (SA) for each pair and then stipulate rules to combine the
peak-ﬁnding results, such as requiring the peaks to be found in all
pairwise comparisons. The CR approach is often used in TF
ChIP—Seq studies to identify all possible binding sites. However,
if the goal is to find consistent binding among replicates, many
false positives may occur where binding is present in only one or a
subset of the samples. The SA approach is more sophisticated in
the sense that it does not lose all information regarding sample-to-
sample variability and is more applicable to experiments that have
a natural pairing of samples. However, because it evaluates peaks
for each replicate separately, the effects of false negatives across
replicates may become compounded. Thus, the SA approach is
more likely to miss moderate, yet consistent, differences in bind-
ing. When there is no inherent pairing between test and control
samples, as often occurs with differential binding analyses, the SA
approach may call a peak because in each one-versus-one analysis,
one sample has greater enrichment than its paired sample. Yet, if

PePr: a pipeline for replicated ChIP-Seq data

 

the pairs were constructed differently, some ‘peaks’ may no longer
exist. An alternative approach is the irreproducible discovery
rate (IDR) (Landt et al., 2012) approach recommended by
ENCODE. IDR can be considered a sophisticated CR approach,
which assesses the consistency of peak rankings in replicates
to ﬁnd an optimum signiﬁcance cutoff for determining the ﬁnal
peak list.

Correctly modeling the variation among samples in gene ex-
pression studies when testing for differential expression has been
shown to be of great importance (Anders and Huber, 2010;
Robinson et al., 2010; Sartor et al., 2006). For RNA-Seq ana-
lysis, several methods [for example, edgeR (Robinson et al.,
2010) and DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010)] use a negative bi-
nomial distribution instead of a Poisson distribution to capture
the extra variance among replicates. These approaches can be
used with ChIP-Seq data; however, they do not perform the
ﬁrst several steps of the ChIP-Seq analysis pipeline nor do they
take advantage of local chromosomal information. An exact
negative binomial test (diffReps) was recently introduced for
ChIP-Seq data and compared with edgeR and DESeq using
two histone modiﬁcation datasets (Shen et al., 2013). Other
approaches to identify differential binding with replicates include
the R packages DiffBind (Ross-Innes et al., 2012) and DBChIP
(Liang and Keles, 2012); although these programs take into
account sample variation, they rely on other peak callers to gen-
erate peak sets for each individual sample first and conduct
analysis on the candidate regions that fall within the peak sets.

Here, we introduce a ChIP-Seq peak-ﬁnding and prioritization
(PePr) pipeline that can analyze either a group of ChIP-Seq sam-
ples together with controls or compare two groups of ChIP-Seq
samples, with or without controls. PePr uses a sliding window
approach and models read counts across replicates and between
groups with a local negative binomial model. Genomic regions
with less variable read counts across replicates are ranked more
favorably than regions with greater variability, thus prioritizing
consistently enriched regions. We tested PePr on ChIP-Seq data
for activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (Han et al., 2013),
seven ENCODE TF datasets and one histone modiﬁcation data-
set (H3K27 tri-methylation), and compared the performance of
PePr to several ChIP-Seq methods representing different statis-
tical models and using different sources of information: MACS
(Zhang et al., 2008), MACS2 and SPP (Kharchenko et al., 2008)
with IDR (Landt et al., 2012), ZINBA (Rashid et al., 2011),
SICER (Zang et al., 2009), diffReps (Shen et al., 2013),
DiffBind (Ross-Innes et al., 2012) and edgeR (Robinson et al.,
2010). We show that PePr performs favorably compared with the
other tested approaches, prioritizing peaks that reﬂect stronger
enrichment fold and higher consistency among samples.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

2.1.] ATF4 data ATF4 data were previously published (Han et al.,
2013). Brieﬂy, samples were obtained from mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts
from transgenic mice after 8h treatment with tunicamycin, including
three ATF4 wild type ChIP samples and three ATF4 knockout ChIP
samples, which served as the controls. Data were obtained from Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the accession number GSE3S681.

2.1.2 EN C ODE TF data Neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF),
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), GA-binding protein (GABP), nuclear
respiratory factor 1 (NRFl), structure maintenance of chromosome 3
(SMC3), upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USFl) and USF2 were down-
loaded from the UCSC collection of ENCODE ChIP-Seq data. Details of
the datasets are provided in Supplementary Table Sl.

2.1.3 H3K27me3 data ChIP-Seq using two human papillomavirus
(HPV)-positive and two HPV-negative squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
cell lines were performed. Cell lines were cultured as previously described
(Sartor et al., 2011), and chromatin immunoprecipitation using
HistonePathTM (Active Motif) for the commercial-quality antibody pull
downs for H3K27 tri-methylation and library preparation were per-
formed by GenPathway, Inc. (part of Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA).
DNA was ampliﬁed according to the Illumina ChIP-Seq library construc-
tion protocol, and a region of 25(P350 bp was excised from the prepara-
tive Agarose gel. Sequencing of the four immunoprecipitated samples and
four input DNA samples was performed at the University of Michigan
DNA sequencing core using the Illumina HiSeq with 50 base single-end
reads. Data were deposited in GEO with accession number GSE 38629.
Raw reads were aligned to hg19 using BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) with
the default parameters.

The total number of aligned reads for each dataset is listed in
Supplementary Table 82. The numbers of peaks called are listed in
Supplementary Table S3.

2.2 PePr algorithm

2.2.] Data preprocessing First, all reads are shifted toward their 3’
direction by half of the empirically estimated DNA fragment length, so
that forward and reverse strand reads are properly aligned. A recom-
mended window width is estimated based on the average width of the
top pre-candidate peaks. PePr then divides the genome into consecutive
windows of the chosen width that overlap by 50% and counts the reads in
each window for every sample. The read counts for each window are
linearly scaled using a normalization constant estimated for each
sample; the normalization methods adjust both for total read count
among ChIP and control samples and relative average peak heights
(owing to differences in ChIP efﬁciency) among ChIP samples. With
the exception of normalization, at each step the user has the option of
whether to accept the PePr default (see Supplementary Methods for a
more detailed description of each of the preprocessing steps).

2.2.2 Negative binomial model and hypothesis testing For each
genomic window, PePr models the read counts with a local negative bi-
nomial distribution, assuming that the test and control groups share the
same dispersion parameter (p, but possibly different means, such that
atcst=y> acomrol. To obtain stable variance estimates even with small
sample sizes, (p is estimated from the current window and windows in
the local genomic region using a triangular kernel function.

To test if each window is enriched in the test group, we test the hy-
pothesis: H0: ygl versus H1:y>1 using a Wald’s test. Using the log
transformation, we can deﬁne

where f/ is the observed ratio of group means, yo = 1, and is the variance
estimate for 6192. Further details of the negative binomial model and the
estimation of (p are provided in Supplementary Methods. For differential
binding experiments, the normalized input reads are subtracted from the
normalized ChIP reads for each window, and both directions are tested
with one ChIP group being the test and the other being control. For
either type of testing, P-values are then calculated, and signiﬁcantly en-
riched windows are determined based on a user/program-speciﬁed cutoff
for P-value. Nearby enriched windows are merged to form continuous

regions, using slightly different parameters for narrow or broad peaks.
Optional post-processing steps are available to (i) remove spurious peaks
identiﬁed by having a high PCR-duplication level and not having a shift
between the forward- and reverse-strand peaks (strand lag) and (ii) reﬁne
peak boundaries for TF binding sites (see Supplementary Methods for
more details).

2.3 Motif analysis

Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation (MEME) (Bailey and Elkan, 1994) was
used to identify overrepresented motifs in the binding sites. For TF data-
sets, peaks that were found in all programs were used, and the region
within 150 bp of the peak mode was used as input to MEME. The most
signiﬁcant motifs identiﬁed by MEME are listed in Supplementary
Figure S], and were consistent with previous reports (Han et al., 2013;
Jothi et al., 2008). On obtaining the motif position-speciﬁc score matrix
for each TF from MEME, Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO)
(Grant et al., 2011) was used to ﬁnd motif matches in the regions within
150 bp of the peak mode found by each program to identify the motif
occurrences in the peaks.

2.4 Unique peak analysis

The versions, parameters and signiﬁcance cutoffs used for each program
are provided in Supplementary Methods (Supplementary Tables S4 and
SS). The unique peaks for each program were deﬁned as the peaks not
overlapping any peak from the alternative program being compared.
Because the number of unique peaks was often highly imbalanced, we
examined the same numbers of top unique peaks with a maximum of 500.
If too few unique peaks (<150) were identiﬁed, then the top 500 peaks
identiﬁed by each but with the highest difference in rank were used as a
surrogate to unique peaks. The heatmaps of unique peaks were generated
using Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment (HOMER)
(Heinz et al., 2010) and visualized with Java TreeView (Saldanha, 2004).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Overview of the PePr method

A schematic overview of the PePr pipeline is shown in Figure 1.
After shifting forward and reverse strand reads to achieve proper
alignment, PePr estimates a recommended window width based
on the median peak width among top pre—candidate peaks to
optimize statistical power. This is in contrast to most peak ﬁn-
ders, which use a ﬁxed or user-speciﬁed window size. Motivated
by the importance of modeling variation in RNA-Seq data, we
model read counts with a negative binomial distribution to ac-
count for extra variation beyond that of the Poisson distribution

observed in replicated ChIP-Seq data (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Unlike the RNA-Seq methods, however, we estimate the disper-
sion parameter (p (which accounts for extra variation) from the
local genomic area. After calculation of P—Values, PePr merges
adjacent signiﬁcant windows to form continuous peak regions,
which then undergo multiple post-processing steps to generate
the ﬁnal peak calls.

The motivation for estimating (p using local genomic informa-
tion is that estimates of (p from one window are often unstable
owing to the small sample sizes commonly used in ChIP-Seq
studies. This problem of unstable variance estimates in experi-
ments with small sample size has been studied extensively in the
context of microarray data analysis, where using information
from other genes has shown signiﬁcant improvement (Sartor
et al., 2006; Smyth, 2004). For ChIP-Seq data, we conjectured
that close genomic regions share a similar microenvironment,
and thus their behavior across samples may be correlated.
Especially for histone marks like H3K27me3 that result in
broad peaks, the estimated dispersion parameters from adjacent
regions show strong correlation (Supplementary Fig. S3). Given
the high autocorrelation observed for (p estimates along the
genome, including information from nearby windows effectively
increases the sample size, improving the robustness of the
estimator.

3.2 Comparisons with other methods

We assess the performance of PePr by applying it to eight
TF ChIP-Seq datasets: NRSF, ATF4, CTCF, GABP, NRF1,
SMC3, USFl and USF2, and to a histone modiﬁcation dataset:
tri-methylation of Histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). The per-
formance was compared with MACS, MACS2, SPP, ZINBA,
edgeR and diffReps for TF data, and to SICER, ZINBA, edgeR,
DiffBind and diffReps for histone data. MACS and SICER are
among the favorite choices for sharp peaks and broad peaks,
respectively. ZINBA uses a similar sliding window approach,
and is geared toward either sharp or broad peaks. MACS and
ZINBA were run with both the CR and SA approaches
described above. IDR was incorporated with MACS2 and
SPP, as is recommended by the ENCODE project. EdgeR was
performed in two ways to distinguish the effects of the core stat-
istical model from the effects of the pre- and post-processing
steps: adopting all of PePr’s pre- and post-processing steps,
and following a basic processing procedure (see Supplementary
Methods for details). We denote them as edgeR-plus and edgeR-
basic, respectively, in the main text.

3.2.] Comparison of PePr and alternative methods using NRSF
ChIP—Seq data The NRSF data consists of two ChIP and two
input DNA samples, each sample having 14.37266 million
mapped reads. PePr identiﬁed a total of 5284 peaks, compar-
able with diffReps, edgeR, SA and IDR-based approaches
(Fig. 2 B7F(i), Supplementary Fig. S4). CR-based approaches
identiﬁed signiﬁcantly more peaks, as expected, because they
gained coverage by pooling samples in the same group. This
trend in number of peaks was also observed for the other TFs
(Supplementary Table S3). Comparing the ranks of peaks among
the methods, we observed high correlation between PePr
and MACS-CR (Pearson’s r=0.73), MACS-SA (r =0.79),

SA (D), edgeR-plus (E) and diffReps (F). The subplots in each panel are
(i) Venn diagram of overlap between peaks found by PePr and the alter-

Each line represents one of the replicates in the group, with the top

centered at the peak mode; each row denotes one peak. (iv) Average
signal intensity of the unique peaks. Solid lines represent the test

edgeR-basic results are presented in Supplementary Figure S4

SPP—IDR (r = 0.93), MACS2-IDR (r = 0.65), edgeR-basic
(r = 0.78) and edgeR-plus (r = 0.84), but much lower correlation
between PePr and ZINBA-CR (r = 0.14), ZINBA-SA (r = 0.16)
and diffReps (r = 70.25) (Supplementary Fig. S5). This trend in
rank correlations between PePr and the other methods was also
observed for the other TFs (see Supplementary Fig. S6 for
ATF4).

The most direct assessment of peak-calling results that has
been used is Visual inspection of the shape and read coverage

of the peak regions (Landt et al., 2012; Rye et al., 2011); how-
ever, because this evaluation process cannot be fully automated,
it is often overlooked in the evaluation of ChIP-Seq methods.
Instead, much of the literature depends on motif occurrence rate
as the main performance measure, which can be inaccurate when
the goal of the analysis is to identify differential or consistent
binding sites under a speciﬁc biological context. Thus, we present
Visual inspections of the peak proﬁle results, as well as the motif
occurrence rates in light of these results.

For each comparison between PePr and an alternative
approach, we examined the peaks uniquely found by each (see
Section 2). In most of the comparisons (except for comparing
with diffReps), PePr-unique peaks were more consistent between
replicates and showed stronger read intensity (Fig. 2A7E(iii) and
Supplementary Fig. S4) than the alternative program. Examining
each peak individually [Fig. 2A7F(ii); the top 20 unique peaks
for each method are shown in Supplementary Peak Proﬁles],
PePr-unique peaks exhibited a smooth peak shape and a
strand lag, whereas unique peaks found by other approaches
had low read count, which formed ambiguous shapes (MACS-
SA, ZINBA-SA and edgeR-plus), peak proﬁle shapes suggesting
inconsistent binding (MACS-CR, ZINBA-CR, SPP-IDR and
MACS2-IDR) or severe PCR-duplications (most notably
diffReps and edgeR-basic). As expected by the limitation of
the CR approach (including IDR), many of their unique peaks
were only observed in one replicate (Fig. 2A and B(ii) and more
examples in Supplementary Fig. S7).

In the average signal intensity plots, the mode height of
MACS-CR, MACS2-IDR and diffReps unique peaks were
higher than PePr-unique peaks [Fig. 2A, B and F(iV)]; however,
they were not the expected peak shape, but rather strongly spiked
with width close to the read length (Supplementary Fig. S8). This
suggests that the reads forming these peaks were mostly PCR
duplicates from a limited number of sequences. Some diffReps-
unique peaks even had the same peak shape in the control sam-
ples, but with fewer reads [Fig. 2F(ii, iv) and Supplementary
Fig. S8]. Although the narrow spiked modes are likely false posi-
tives with no shift size between strands, the signal levels of the
shoulders of these plots likely represent real binding sites, with
the expected shift size between strands. The signal in these shoul-
der regions are higher in PePr than the alternatives [Fig. 2A
and B(iV)].

We compared the motif rates for peaks uniquely identified by
PePr or an alternative approach (Table 1). The peaks uniquely
found by PePr had comparable motif occurrence rate with
MACS-CR, ZINBA-CR and MACS2-IDR, and had substan-
tially higher motif occurrence rate than MACS-SA, ZINBA-
SA, SPP-IDR, diffReps and edgeR-basic (Table 1). However,
the motif rate of PePr’s unique peaks is lower than edgeR-plus
for NRSF, contrary to their stronger read signals [Fig. 2E(iV)].
The difference between edgeR-plus and edgeR-basic suggests
that adopting PePr’s processing steps results in a marked im-
provement. The CR approaches gained coverage by pooling
the samples, resulting in a motif occurrence rate similar to
that of PePr. Although the motif is often present, many of
their unique peaks only showed enrichment in one replicate
(Supplementary Fig. S7), and thus would likely be false positives
for identification of consistent binding sites in a speciﬁc biolo-
gical context under study. In the case of diffReps, the low motif

occurrence rate in the unique peaks suggests that those peaks
with a narrow spiked shape were likely not true NRSF binding
sites (Supplementary Fig. S8).

3.2.2 Comparison of PePr and alternative methods using ATF4
and additional ENC ODE ChIP-Seq data We repeated the com-
parison among methods on ATF4 ChIP-Seq data, which had
three samples each of ChIP and control (each having 26.87302
million mapped reads), and the control samples were from chro-
matin-immunoprecipitated ATF4 knockout mice. All methods
identiﬁed nearly twice as many or more peaks for ATF4 as for
NRSF, except diffReps, which identiﬁed substantially fewer peaks
than all other methods (Supplementary Table S3). Again, we
examined the unique peaks found by PePr versus the other pro-
grams. In all comparisons, we observed PePr unique (or ranked
higher) peaks had higher read intensities (if we remove the high-

higher motif occurrence rate than the alternative programs,
including edgeR-plus (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S9 and Table 1).

We analyzed six additional ENCODE TF datasets (CTCF,
GABP, NRF1, SMC3, USFl and USF2), which had conserved
motifs and both replicated ChIP and control samples. Because
we showed in the NRSF comparison that the CR-based methods
identify many sites that are inconsistent among samples, in these
additional datasets we compared PePr with each of the alterna-
tive methods that take into account variation/differences among
the replicates: diffReps, edgeR-basic, edgeR-plus, MACS-SA
and ZINBA-SA, with the same motif analysis (Table 2). In 24
of 30 comparisons, PePr-unique peaks had higher motif occur-
rence rate than the alternative method.

ples and the goal of identifying consistent differences between
HPV( +) and HPV(i) tumors, the CR approach would not be suit-
able; thus, we compared PePr with the SA approach using two peak
callers developed for broad peaks: ZINBA and SICER, as well as
diffReps, DiffBind and edgeR-plus.

To ﬁnd HPV(i)-speciﬁc peaks, we used HPV(i) cell lines as
the test samples and compared them with the HPV(+) cell lines.

Note: Bold values indicate the higher motif occurrence rate in each comparison. “Peaks with highest rank difference were used, as explained in Section 2.

For ZINBA and SICER, age- and gender-matched samples were
used in each pair. SICER identiﬁed 35 403 HPV(i)-specific peaks
for the ﬁrst pair, 20 207 peaks for the second pair and 8823 re-
gions (19%) were found in both. ZINBA identiﬁed 13 814 peaks
and 22 701 peaks, respectively, and only 1878 regions (5%) were
found in both, illustrating the substantial level of variation
among the samples in each group. PePr, diffReps and edgeR-
plus identified 1015, 17924 and 181 peaks, respectively. EdgeR-
plus identiﬁed few signiﬁcant peaks, possibly because of the high
global dispersion parameter estimated from the data, whereas
PePr estimated it locally. DiffReps was much more sensitive
than edgeR as previously shown for broad peaks (Shen et al.,
2013). For DiffBind, SICER peaksets were generated for each
cell line and used as input to the program. The peaksets were
merged and a total of 29510 regions were tested. DiffBind has
two built-in analysis methods: edgeR and DESeq. DiffBind with
edgeR reported no signiﬁcant peaks (possibly because of the
same reason explained above). With DESeq it identiﬁed 918
HPV(i)-speciﬁc sites, which we use for DiffBind below.

Because the number of peaks varied substantially among the
programs tested, we evaluated how each program prioritized the
peak ﬁndings. The top 900 peaks from each program were
chosen based on their signiﬁcance and compared (edgeR-plus
was excluded because of ﬁnding few peaks; 900 was chosen be-
cause all other methods identiﬁed 3900 sites). Figure 4A shows
the overlap between PePr and each of the other five programs.
We examined the top-ranking peaks that were uniquely identiﬁed
by PePr, SICER, ZINBA, DiffBind or diffReps. The peaks
uniquely identiﬁed by PePr were consistent between replicates,
whereas the peaks uniquely found by SICER, ZINBA or
DiffBind often showed large differences in coverage between
samples in the same group (Fig. 4BrD). DiffReps unique
peaks seemed consistent in coverage between samples in the
same group; however, the ratio in coverage between the test
and control groups was smaller than that of PePr (Fig. 4E). In
addition, when looking at each peak individually, the top
diffReps unique peaks had average peak width <2 kb, which is
much narrower than that expected for H3K27me3.

we randomly sample half of the reads to produce several pseudo
half-size libraries. The proportion of peaks called only in the
half-size library but not in the full-size library is deﬁned as the
scaling FDR. Performing this for 10 simulations, we observed
that PePr had a smaller scaling FDR (mean = 1.66%) than
SICER (mean = 4.56%), ZINBA (mean = 11.38%), diffReps
(mean = 12.54%) and edgeR-plus (mean = 5.83%), and thus

PePr’s peak prediction was most robust to differences in cover-
age levels (Supplementary Fig. S11).

4 DISCUSSION

Currently, there is a lack of ChIP-Seq analysis programs that
account for biological variability within the peak-ﬁnding process.
We have developed a method and tool, PePr, which uses a local
negative binomial model to identify consistent or differential
binding sites among ChIP-Seq data, and that additionally
estimates the optimal moving window size and offers post-
processing steps to reduce false positives and refine peak
resolution.

Variation among samples in ChIP-Seq data can sometimes be
large, such that some binding sites, even for TFs, are not repro-
ducible (Landt et al., 2012). Inconsistent TF peaks among bio-
logical samples can exist for many reasons, including differences
in accessibility of chromatin regions (e. g. because of the histone
tail modiﬁcations or DNA methylation), common sequence vari-
ants, competitive or cooperative binding differences with another
TF (Whitﬁeld et al., 2012) or technical artifacts that only
occurred in one of the replicates. However, all but the last of
these reasons are not significant concerns for most peak-ﬁnder
programs, the goal of which is to identify all potential bind-
ing sites rather than consistent or differential binding sites. In
addition, as public datasets from large consortiums such as
ENCODE (Consortium et al., 2012) more comprehensively
cover known TF binding in commonly used cell and tissue
types, there will be less incentive for individual laboratories to
identify all of the potential binding sites for a protein, as many
will be available. A more reﬁned hypothesis may be ‘where does
this TF (or histone modification) bind consistently in this speciﬁc
context (a speciﬁc disease, developmental stage, exposure or
treatment)?’ Accurately modeling the variation is highly import-
ant in population epigenomics studies where substantial vari-
ation exists among samples, not only among individuals but
also between tissue types (Cui et al., 2009), developmental time
points (Rugg-Gunn et al., 2010; Sarmento et al., 2004) and
during disease progression (Conte and Altucci, 2014; Jakopovic
et al., 2013).

We compared PePr with five commonly used single-sample
peak finders that use different underlying statistical models
(MACS, MACS2, SPP, ZINBA and SICER), as well as three
programs that were designed for replicates (diffReps, DiffBind
and edgeR), and found that PePr performed favorably in terms
of consistently enriched read counts, motif occurrence rate and
known characteristics of TF binding based on Visual inspection.
For comparison with MACS, ZINBA or SICER, we either per-
formed separate paired analyses and then called peaks in the
overlapping regions (SA) or combined the reads for the replicates
and called peaks from the concatenated lists (CR). IDR was
incorporated with MACS2 and SPP to determine the peak list
cutoff, as recommended by the ENCODE consortium. Visual
inspection of the peak shape and summarizing the read counts
in peaks were extremely valuable in characterizing the unique
tendencies of each approach. In particular, MACS was sensitive
to detecting regions that had low background and tended to miss
peaks that had a relatively high background [Fig. 2A(iii)]§ Visual
inspection of the ZINBA and diffReps unique peaks revealed

that many had similar peak shape in both ChIP and control
samples; SPP had severe false negatives for the NRSF data,
which is possibly because of the removal of true binding sites
that SPP mistakenly assumed to be artifacts because of having
unexpectedly small shift size [i.e. in the ‘phantom peak’ as
deﬁned in (Landt et al., 2012)]. When we compared PePr with
SPP-IDR and MACS2-IDR, we observed PePr-unique peaks
(that are missed by the other two) had high read counts and
motif rate.

Although motif occurrence rate is a useful marker for DNA
binding, its value as a marker for consistent or differential DNA
binding is not as clear. For identiﬁcation of all DNA binding
sites, motif analysis is expected to be specific (if the motif is
found within a peak, it is assumed that binding occurs) but not
necessarily highly sensitive (indirect binding cooperatively with
other protein(s) may not result in a motif occurrence). Because
the percent of binding sites without a motif is only expected to
vary by DNA binding protein, and not by peak caller, this is
often ignored when comparing peak callers. However, for con-
sistent or differential binding experiments we can no longer
assume speciﬁcity; a peak finder that identiﬁes fewer overall
peaks with a motif than an alternative may be correct in not
calling the additional peaks as consistently bound or differen-
tially bound. Given these caveats, we nonetheless found motif
occurrence rate informative for interpreting our results when
used in conjunction with Visual inspection of peaks. The large
improvement in motif occurrence rates for PePr-unique peaks
compared with peaks identified by the SA approaches and
edgeR-basic suggests that peaks with higher read intensities
and the expected smooth peak shape are more likely to contain
a motif (Table 1). The CR approaches, on the other hand, were
comparable in motif occurrence rate with PePr, but many of
these were only bound in one replicate on Visual inspection,
and thus are likely false positives for identiﬁcation of consistent
binding sites in the biological system under study.

Although PePr and edgeR use a similar underlying negative
binomial model, edgeR lacks initial steps required for ChIP-Seq
peak ﬁnding (shifting opposite strand reads, defining and sum-
marizing reads per window, etc), does not incorporate informa-
tion from neighboring windows, which especially benefits histone
modiﬁcation analyses, and does not offer post-processing
steps to improve peak resolution or reduce false positives. In
five of the eight TF datasets, PePr performed better in
motif rate than edgeR if the same PePr-processing steps are per-
formed for edgeR; with the histone data, PePr was more sensitive
than edgeR owing to estimation of the dispersion parameters
locally. PePr’s post-processing steps improved edgeR’s perform-
ance when there is a high proportion of PCR-duplicate peaks
(6% in NRSF, 1.6% in ATF4 and<0.5% in other datasets).
DiffBind was previously shown to work well with differential
binding in TF data (Ross-Innes et al., 2012); however, in
H3K27me3 data with broad and highly variable peaks,
DiffBind’s edgeR module had low detection power, whereas its
DESeq module identiﬁed 918 peaks, many of which were incon-
sistent among samples. DiffReps resulted in unpredictable num-
bers of peaks across the datasets we tested, for example, it
identiﬁed substantially fewer peaks than all other programs for
ATF4 and SMC3 (Supplementary Table S3) but many more for
H3K27me3.

PePr: a pipeline for replicated ChIP-Seq data

 

Owing to the lack of benchmarks in histone modiﬁcation data-
sets, in this manuscript we mainly relied on TF datasets to com-
pare methods. However, PePr is adaptable to datasets with either
sharp or broad peaks because of its empirical estimation of the
optimal sliding window size, and thus is equally relevant for
analysis of histone modiﬁcation ChIP-Seq datasets as illustrated
with our H3K27me3 data. H3K27me3 tends to occur in broad
regions several kilobases in length, making consistent peak call-
ing more difficult. Based on our Visual inspection of peaks and
scaling FDR analysis for the approaches compared, we showed
that PePr identiﬁed binding regions consistent between groups
without being sensitive to changes in read coverage.

One limitation of PePr is that it currently does not perform
paired analysis, similar to the limitation of multiple RNA-Seq
differential analysis programs (Anders and Huber, 2010;
Trapnell et al., 2013); thus, for example, the paired nature of
tumor and patient-matched normal samples could not be taken
into account. For experiments requiring covariates, we currently
recommend edgeR. PePr also makes the assumption that the
quality of data for each ChIP-Seq experiment is approximately
equal, similar to most methods for other types of high-through-
put analysis. When this assumption is violated, the result may be
a high false-negative rate owing to missing peak regions in the
lower quality sample(s); this may especially be true for experi-
ments with small sample size. In this case, users may obtain
better performance using a different peak ﬁnder on individual
samples, and a secondary method to explore options to combine
results. Future versions of peak finders for replicated ChIP-Seq
data could take into account quality, for example, by assigning a
weight to each sample.

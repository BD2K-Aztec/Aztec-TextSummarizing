Abstract

Summary: Complex formation and conformational transitions of biological macromolecules in so—
lution can be effectively studied using the information about overall shape and size provided by
small angle X—ray scattering (SAXS). Hybrid modeling is often applied to integrate high—resolution
models into SAXS data analysis. To facilitate this task, we present SASpy, a PyMOL plugin that pro—
vides an easy—to—use graphical interface for SAXS—based hybrid modeling. Through a few mouse
clicks in SASpy, low—resolution models can be superimposed to high—resolution structures, theoret—
ical scattering profiles and fits can be calculated and displayed on—the—fly. Mouse—based manual re—
arrangements of complexes are conveniently applied to rapidly check and interactively refine tenta—
tive models. Interfaces to automated rigid—body and flexible refinement of macromolecular models
against the experimental SAXS data are provided.

Availability and implementation: SASpy is available as open source at: github.com/emblsaxs/
saspy/. Working installations of both PyMOL (www.pymol.org) and ATSAS (www.embl—hamburg.

 

de/biosaxs/download.html) are required.

1 Introduction

Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) can be used to obtain size,
shape and oligomerization information of biological macromol-
ecules in solution, and the method has become an important part of
the structural biology toolbox (Graewert and Svergun, 2013). The
interpretation of SAXS experiments relies heavily on computational
tools, such as the comprehensive collection of programs in the multi-
platform ATSAS package (Petoukhov et (11., 2012). ATSAS includes
programs for SAXS data manipulation and analysis, calculation
of overall parameters, [lb initio shape determination and
oligomeric analysis. Given the atomic or predicted models of the en-
tire particle or of its domains/subunits, tools are available to com-
pute theoretical scattering profiles, fits and also to perform hybrid
modeling and refinement (Petoukhov and Svergun, 2005). Most of
the ATSAS programs operate through the command line interface
(CLI), but often a graphical way to interact with models can be

convenient, e.g. visually rearranging subunits in a macromolecular
complex may be simpler than defining a set of translations and rota-
tions numerically.

At present, there is a point-and-click interface to evaluate theor-
etical SAXS profiles in the Chimera visualization software (Huang
et (11., 2014). Chimera’s SAXS module requires an active internet
connection (it is based on the FoXS web server (Schneidman—
Duhovny et (11., 2010)) and it is limited to the computation of theor-
etical scattering from a given model and its fit to experimental data.
Much more elaborated manipulations including rigid-body refine-
ment of complexes are available through the graphical interface of
MASSHA (Konarev et (11., 2001), which is included in ATSAS.
MASSHA incorporates its own three-dimensional (3D) display and
refinement functions, but has some limitations. Most notably, it is
Windows-only; further, it uses keystrokes instead of the mouse for
the manual rearrangement of complexes; finally, MASSHA requires

precalculated amplitudes of the individual subunits or domains to
perform rigid—body modeling.

To overcome the limitations mentioned above, we present the
SASpy plugin that combines tools available in the ATSAS software
suite with the graphical display resources of the popular PyMOL
molecular visualization software (DeLano, 2015). Given its trans—
parent implementation, SASpy serves as well as a starting point for
the user to further automatize or parameterize the analysis work—
flow through the CLI, if needed. Special care has been taken to
make through SASpy a simple and flexible interface to ATSAS that
can readily be used without specific training and with minimum ne—
cessary input files and parameters. As with other PyMOL plugins,
SASpy is distributed as open source. This allows the users to modify
or add functions at will, extending the applicability and usefulness
of SASpy to fit their particular workflows.

2 Implementation

The SASpy main window presents a series of tabs that cover differ—
ent procedures. Loaded models can be selected right below the tabs,
and as with SAXS experimental input files, the selection is preserved
and available as the user switches through the different tabs and pro—
cedures described below. For most procedures, the corresponding
binary from ATSAS is executed with appropriate parameters within
a temporary working directory and the results are presented to the
user. During the calculations, the output log is displayed in the
PyMOL terminal to keep the user up—to—date about the progress,
possible errors and available results. Upon completion of the execu—
tion of a refinement step the obtained models are loaded into
PyMOL and displayed automatically. If SAXS profiles are estimated
or fitted, these will be displayed by default using the program
SASPLOT (Petoukhov et al., 2012), but the user can set an alterna—
tive data display program in the configuration tab.

2.1 Basic operation and model manipulation

To calculate the default theoretical scattering of a given model,
SASpy will execute CRYSOL (Svergun et al., 1995) in predictive
mode and display both the output log and the obtained curve. If the
user selects a .dat file containing experimental SAXS data, CRYSOL
will be executed in the fitting mode and the obtained fit against the
experimental data will be displayed. A generic expansion of PyMOL
functionality is provided through the SUPALM tab, which allows
one to superimpose high— and low—resolution models. SUPALM is a
recently developed faster version of SUPCOMB (Kozin and Svergun,
2001) for automated superposition of two objects without corres—
pondence between individual coordinates (atoms or beads). The
matched model is presented graphically and a normalized spatial
discrepancy (Kozin and Svergun, 2001) is displayed as a quantitative
estimate of similarity between the objects. When working with a
macromolecular complex, the subunits can be loaded as independ—
ent coordinate files and rearranged (moved or rotated) using the
editing features of PyMOL. The fit of the rearranged assembly
against the experimental SAXS data can be obtained using the
CRYSOL tab. The manual modeling may be useful to get a feeling
of the overall sensitivity of the SAXS data to the rearrangements
(e.g. for educational purposes) but can also serve as the starting
point of the refinement procedures described below.

2.2 Hybrid modeling and refinement
Besides model manipulation and analysis, SASpy also offers an inter—
face for automated refinement. Given the SAXS data from a

macromolecular assembly of unknown structure, high—resolution
models of its subunits, if available, can be used to construct a model
of the entire assembly. Automated rigid—body modeling can be carried
out in SASpy through the SASREF tab, which allows the user to select
a set of models (subunits) and the SAXS profile of the assembly to
launch the program SASREF (Petoukhov and Svergun, 2005). Using
SASREF through SASpy is much simpler and more intuitive than the
standard command line version. Through SASpy, the user does not
need to provide precomputed amplitudes of the subunits (which are
calculated on—the—fly). Moreover, the positions/orientations of the cur—
rent configuration shown in the PyMOL screen are used as the start—
ing point for the refinement, obviating the need for the user to specify
the numerical values for rotations and translations of the individual
subunits as in the CLI version. The same applies to the SREFLEX tab,
which utilizes a recently developed approach (Panjkovich and
Svergun, 2016) to refine the models consisting of one or multiple
high—resolution structures against a SAXS experimental profile by
flexible fitting based on normal mode analysis. The refinements by
SASREF and SREFLEX are executed as separated CPU threads, so the
user can continue to work normally within PyMOL.

3 Concluding remarks

SASpy, available for the three major computing platforms
(Windows, Mac OS X and Linux), is easy to install as a PyMOL plu—
gin. SASpy requires a working installation of PyMOL and the source
code can be downloaded and compiled from sourceforge.net/pro—
jects/pymol/. Pre—compiled binaries can be obtained from
Schrodinger at www.pymol.org, these are freely available for educa—
tional purposes. A local installation of ATSAS version 2.7 or higher
(Petoukhov et al., 2012) is also required for correct functionality of
SASpy, as it automated superposition and SAS—related features are
based on ATSAS binaries. The ATSAS installation package is freely
available to academic users at www.embl—hamburg.de/biosaxs/
downloadhtml and includes a copy of SASpy. The plugin should be
useful for the beginners in SAXS as it serves as a graphical interface
to multiple ATSAS functions. We also expect SASpy to be an intui—
tive educational tool superseding the Windows—only program
MASSHA (Konarev et al., 2001). SASpy shall also be useful for ex—
perts providing a convenient environment to modify models inter—
actively and allowing rapid comparisons to be executed and
displayed on line. SASpy may also be further expanded by the com—
munity, given its open source nature.

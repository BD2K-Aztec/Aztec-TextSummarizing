Abstract

Motivation: Free energy nearest—neighbour (NN) thermodynamics is widely used in DNA biochem—
istry, ranging from the calculation of melting temperatures to the prediction of secondary struc—
tures. Methods to calculate NN parameters require the knowledge of total sequence entropies and
enthalpies, which are not always available.

Results: Here, we implement and test a new melting temperature optimization method where we
obtain the NN parameters directly from the temperatures. In this way, we bypass the constraints
imposed by total sequence entropies and enthalpies. This enabled us to calculate the missing NN
entropies and enthalpies for some published datasets, including salt—dependent parameters. Also
this allowed us to combine 281 sequences from different types of melting temperature data for
which we derived a new set of NN parameters, which have a smaller uncertainty and an improved
predictive power.

1 Introduction

 

The concept of dividing a DNA or RNA sequence into pieces of
nearest-neighbour (NN) pairs for predicting melting temperatures
(Tm) was pioneered 40 years ago by Borer et al. (1974). Breslauer
et a]. (1986) introduced much of the concepts and terminologies
that are in use today. A more detailed analysis of the NN representa-
tion was given by Gray (1997) and later by Licinio and Guerra
(2007). Its simplicity of use and effectiveness has made it into a
nearly universal method for applications in oligonucleotide chemis-
try and molecular biology.

With this technique, predictions of thermodynamic properties
for any unknown sequence can be made by summing over NN
entropies and enthalpies (APNN with P : H.S). The method which
is currently in use for extracting APNN is essentially based on writing

a set of linear equations where each equation represents the total en-

tropy or the total enthalpy variations (AP’1 of a given sequence i.

0t)
For the remainder of this article, we call this the total entropy and
enthalpy variation (TEEV) method. Therefore, it is necessary to first
obtain the total AP’W. This can be done either by curve fitting the

melting curve or from a linear regression of Tml versus log C, in
which case one needs a number of measurements at different species
concentrations Cf. Unfortunately, both curve-fitting or Tml >< log C,
methods introduce a certain amount of uncertainty into the resulting
parameters APNN. Furthermore, the total AP’lot may, for various
reasons, not be available at all.

Here, we propose a new melting temperature optimization (MTO)

method, which does not require the total parameters AP“.

Instead, we simply fit the APNN, which best describe the melting

Fig. 1. Schematic workflow for obtaining NN parameters from melting temperatures. (a) The usual approach involving total entropies and enthalpies values

(TEEV) and (b) the method based solely on MTO

temperatures Tm. This direct approach has two advantages over the
TEEV method. One is that we fit the much more accurate melting
temperatures Tm. The other is that this method can be applied to situ—
ations where the total parameters APlil-0t are unavailable. For example,
one can work out the NN parameters from the melting temperatures,
which were measured only for a single species concentration for each
DNA sequence. Figure 1 summarizes the differences between the
methods. Another interesting feature of the model is that the initializa—
tion parameters can be obtained in the framework of the MTO.

Numerically, the MTO minimizes the difference between meas—
ured and predicted melting temperatures by varying the APNN
parameters freely. Here, we applied the MTO method successfully
to the dataset by SantaLucia (1998) and showed that the resulting
predictive uncertainty is significantly reduced. We used a similar
method for the non—linear Peyrard—Bishop model (Weber et al. 2009,
2013a, b). The good results obtained for the non—linear model were
one of our main motivations to investigate the applications of the
MTO method to the linear NN model.

One key aspect of obtaining the free energy parameters APNN is
the experimental set of melting temperatures. Unsurprisingly, different
sets are bound to result in different parameters. Here, we analysed the
two sets by SantaLucia et al. (1996) and SantaLucia (1998). However,
as total sequence entropies and enthalpies are not required, we could
also analyse the datasets by Owczarzy et al. (2004) (D—OW04). We dis—
cuss the significant differences resulting from those datasets, especially
regarding initiation parameters. Finally, we combined the datasets D—
SL98 and D—OW04 into a new set for which we obtain the best overall
melting temperature prediction.

2 Methods
2.1 Data

In this work, we are using five different datasets to test the optimiza—
tion method. Table 1 presents a summary of these datasets and the
notation adopted throughout this work. The D—SL96 includes the
non—two—state sequences, otherwise we would not have enough
sequences for retrieving all initiation parameters. The D—SL98
dataset was used by SantaLucia (1998) to retrieve NN parameters
(P—SL98), which is widely used for temperature prediction.
Note that the actual sequences and temperatures were in fact
published in the Supplementary Tables of Allawi and SantaLucia
(1997), but it has become common practice to refer to them as
coming from SantaLucia (1998). D—OW04 are the melting
temperatures obtained from ultra—violet absorption measurements
at five different salt concentrations by Owczarzy et al. (2004).

The D—OW04DSC dataset comprised the same DNA sequences as in
D—OW04 but measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
at low and high salt concentrations. All sequences in D—OW04 and
D—OW04DSC are non—self—complementary. D—CMB is the combin—
ation of all data from D—SL98, D—OW04 and D—OW04DSC at high
salt concentration.

where f: 1 for self—complementary sequences and f :4 otherwise.
C, is the species concentration and Co : 1 uM is the reference con—
centration introduced to insure that the argument to the logarithm is
dimensionless. AH,Fm and ASE0t are the total entropy and enthalpy
variations for sequence 1'.

2.3 NN models
The various NN models found in the literature differ mainly by the
introduction of initiation factors, which try to take into account
symmetry and several other specific aspects of nucleotide sequences.
The optimization method presented here can be used with any of
these methods.

The basic model is simply the summation of all NN parameters 17

APE“ = Z mm + E anp‘ (2)

where A17, is either the enthalpy (sz) or the entropy (172$)
variation for n,“ occurrences of NN types or in the ith sequence.
Additional correction factors Ap‘ may be added, such as

The aim of the method is to minimize

where T, is the measured melting temperature for the ith sequence.
T; is the corresponding predicted temperature resulting from the set
of tentative parameters

IPIk : {pklvpk27pk37- - -}- (4)

We start with an initial set of parameters {p}0 and let the param—
eters vary until we minimize as much as possible x2. After L steps of
minimizations, the resulting set {p}L represents the parameters
which best reproduce the melting temperatures for the model.

To minimize simultaneously all parameters, we used the multidi—
mensional Nelder—Mead or downhill simplex method (Press et al.,
1988) in a similar way as for the non—linear models (Weber et al.,
2009). Each local minimization was carried as follows:

1. Deﬁne a set of initial parameters {p}0.

Carry out the minimization with a characteristic length which
should be roughly of the order of magnitude of the parameters
(Press et al., 1988). Here, we used a value of 10 for the charac—
teristic length.

3. Stop the minimization either when the variation of 12 from one
round to the next falls below 0.01 or when a limit of L : 3000
steps is reached.

4. Use the newly obtained parameters {17} as new initial parameters
and repeat the whole procedure five more times.

In addition to Equation (3), the following parameters are used to as—
sess the quality of the minimization:

2.5 Global minimization

The drawback of the minimization of Equation (3) is that most of
the time we will find only local minima. This is especially problem—
atic for minimizations involving experimental data because local
minima may be result of noise. One way to overcome this problem
is to repeat the local minimization many times with different initial
parameters {p}0. We will call this procedure global minimization,
i.e. the attempt to find the local minima which is closest to the glo—
bal minimum. In summary, a global minimization is M repetitions
of local minimizations by varying certain conditions randomly each
time.

2.5.2 Global minimization work ﬂow

We carry out the global minimization in two different ways. First
we vary randomly the initial parameters {p}0 over a large
range of values and perform a new local minimization. After a
certain number M1 of local minimizations we keep the set of param—
eters {p}2“" 22 with the smallest x2. Here, we repeat the local mini—
mizations 1000 times (M1 : 1000).

For the second block of global minimizations, we take the best
parameters from the first block and use them as fixed initial param—
eters ({p}0 : {p}?" 22 ), but now we vary randomly the experimen—
tal temperatures. We create a new set of modified temperatures
{T},’, which differ by random amounts from the original set {T} in
such a way that on average the standard deviation between the two
sets is close to the declared experimental uncertainty of 03°C. We
repeat this procedure using I}, : 0.01 as stop criterion, see Equation
(13), resulting in a variable number M2 of new local minimizations.
From these M2 results, we calculate the average parameters, which
are presented here.

2.6 Parameter correlation
To compare different parameters sets {17} and {q}, we use the
Pearson’s sample correlation coefficient,

21p,- — <p>>Z,<q,- — on (14)

rm : —1/2 .

[21:2,- — <p>>ZZ,<qi — W]

In this work, we will provide the correlation coefficient separ—
ately for entropies (rs) and enthalpies (7H) and only for NN param—
eters. Initiation parameters are not included in the parameter
correlation. Please note that this coefficient is not part of the MTO
method and is used only as a guide to aid the comparison between
different parameter sets.

DNA sequence and melting temperatures datasets are prefixed by
D—, published parameters by P—, initiation parameters by iP— and
averaged optimized parameters by AOP—.

3 Results and discussion

The most problematic aspect of the MTO method presented
here is the occurrence of local minima which are likely to occur
when adjusting experimental data and are mainly caused by
fluctuation due to experimental uncertainties. To overcome this
problem, our method is applied in two distinct steps. First, we
repeat the minimization many times where we vary the initial
parameters by a very large amount. From this step, we obtain
the parameters with the smallest disagreement from the experi—
mental temperatures. In the second step, we use the previous
parameters as input and now vary the experimental tempera—
tures within their declared experimental uncertainty. This last
step provides us with an estimate of parameter uncertainty re—
sulting from experimental fluctuations. See section 2.5.2 for
details.

We consider here two types of predictions: self—predictions and
cross—predictions. Self—predictions are those where the parameters
were derived from the same dataset that is being predicted.

experimental temperatures for dataset D-CMB at 1000mM [Nat]. The cross-
predictions using the (a) original P-SL96, (b) the original P-SL98 and (c) the
self-prediction for optimized AOP-CMB parameters are shown. The closer the
points are to the diagonal dashed lines, the better the prediction quality.
Predictions are shown as bullets if they are within 1°C of the experimental
points, otherwise they are shown as crosses. Data points are horizontally
shifted to the right for clarity, and the resulting average temperature
deviation (AT) is calculated from Equation (5)

For instance, predicting the melting temperatures of the sequences in
D—SL98 using parameters AOP—SL98. Cross—predictions are predic—
tions where the dataset is different from the one used to obtain the
parameters.

Figure 2 shows some examples of melting temperature predic—
tions as scatter plots for the combined dataset D—CMB. The predic—
tions obtained from the older parameter set P—SL96 (SantaLucia
et al., 1996), Figure 2a, is one of the poorest. The frequently used
set P—SL98 (SantaLucia, 1998) is clearly a significant improvement
as shown in Figure 2b but the prediction, especially at higher tem—
peratures, still suffers. Figure 2c shows the self—predictions from the
optimized parameter set AOP—CMB with very little dispersion along
the diagonal line and a very low average temperature deviation
(AT). This clearly shows that the MTO method minimizes Equation
(3) much more uniformly for all temperatures. Note that it would be
very difficult, if not impossible, to treat such a combined set with
the usual single value decomposition method. The reason is that for
the TEEV method one needs the total entropies and enthalpies of all
sequences, which are not available for the D—OW04 and D—
OW04DSC datasets.

Evidently, Figure 2 only shows how the MTO successfully min—
imizes the difference in temperatures between datasets and predic—
tions when compared with other methods. A much more complete
overview is presented in Table 3 where we show a summary of all
predictions performed in this work. For all optimizations, the aver—
age temperature deviation (AT) and its ATRMS are considerably
reduced for self—predictions. Better self—prediction, however, typic—
ally results into poorer cross—predictions. For example, the opti—
mized AOP—SL98 results into much better self prediction that the
original P—SL98, reducing (AT) from 1.9°C to 1.5°C. But for cross—
predictions, AOP—SL98 is generally poorer than SL98. The opti—
mized parameters AOP—OW04 and AOP—OW04DSC are exception—
ally good at self—predicting melting temperatures but do perform
poorly otherwise. This is true even when using AOP—OW04 to pre—
dict D—OW04DSC and vice versa, even though both use exactly the
same sequences.

With the choice of dataset playing such a crucial choice, we com—
bined the D—SL98, D—OW04 and D—OW04DSC into a single set
D—CMB. Once again the self—prediction is very good, at 1.4°C, and
all its cross—predictions are second—best if compared with the

self—predictions of other parameters, Table 3. Compared with the
widely used P—SL98 parameters, AOP—CMB reduces (AT) by 0.5°C
and ATRMS by 0.6°C for the D—CMB dataset.

The TEEV method aims at getting close to the total entropy
and enthalpy variations, AH—r0t and ASTm, for all sequences.
Nevertheless, the difference between the self—predicted and experi—
mental total parameters for the P—SL98 TEEV parameters is rather
large, 7.2% and 8.2% for AH-i-m and ASTm, respectively. For the
MTO parameters AOP—CMB, there is an increase to 12% and 14%
when predicting the total parameters AH—r0t and AS—r0t of D—SL98.

With the MTO method being clearly able to produce acceptable
self—predictions comes the question of how the MTO parameters
compare to those obtained from TEEV method. To assess this
unambiguously, we calculated the correlation between the param—
eters using Equation (14), where a good correlation should yield a
number close to 1. Table 4 presents correlations comparing all
parameters analysed in this work. There is mostly very little correl—
ation between optimized dataset, which explains the generally poor
cross—prediction. For the AOP—CMB optimized parameters, there is
some correlation for the {AH} with the original P—SL98 and a mod—
erate correlation when it comes to {AS Note that initiation param—
eters were not included in the correlation analysis and that the
correlation coefficients may not be a reliable indicator of similarity
if non—unique parameters are included.

The complete set of parameters for all optimizations at high salt
concentrations is listed in Table 5. In general, the enthalpies have a
similar behaviour as for the TEEV parameters (P—SL96 and P—SL98).
For entropies, however, important changes are observed with their val—
ues covering a much wider range. These wide ranges of entropies are
accompanied by large positive variations in initiation factors, in par—
ticular for the AOP—OW04 and AOP—OW04DSC with some of them
becoming as high as (ASE-r11“) : 35 cal/mol. One crucial difference from
D—OW04(DSC) to all other datasets is the absence of self—complemen—
tary sequences. This may explain the important parameter variations,
especially for entropies seen for the AOP—OW04(DSC) parameters.
The enthalpies of AOP—CMB are clearly closer to the original P—SL98,
as already noted from the correlation factors. As the total parameters
AH,tot and ASE0t in P—SL98 are essentially averaging out differences in

melting temperatures from various species concentrations C,, it would
seem that a similar averaging effect is occurring for AOP—CMB.

Good self—prediction with poor cross—prediction may sometimes in—
dicate over—fitting, i.e. fitting to noise. Could this be the case for the
AOP—OW04(DSC) parameters? The second block of global minimiza—
tions, see section 2.5.2, is precisely to assess this type of situation. As
we randomly vary the temperatures within the experimental uncer—
tainty, we effectively change the position of the experimental noise. If
over—fitting was occurring, we should have seen large parameter
uncertainties; however, this not the case as shown in Table 5.

As the datasets D—OW04 and D—OW04DSC are measured at
various salt concentrations (Table 1), we can now calculate the par—
ameters as function of [Na+]. Figure 3 shows the parameter depend—
ence with salt concentration for datasets D—OW04 and D—
OW04DSC. Note that D—OW04DSC is measured only at the lowest
and highest salt concentrations. Only ApT, TpA and ApA (panels c
and g) show similar trends for D—OW04 and D—OW04DSC. All re—
maining parameters display very dissimilar behaviours, and no par—
ticular conclusion can be drawn at this stage except that sequence
context seems to play an important role for salt concentration cor—
rections. On the other hand, the qualitative trends of enthalpies and
entropies are nearly identical, possibly resulting from the form of
Equation (1). If the influence of the term In Ct/fCo is small then one
would expect AH? to become largely proportional ASﬁ‘. One word
of caution is needed here, one should keep in mind that these are
self—predictions and contain no self—complementary sequences.
Therefore changes to the salt—dependent results should be expected
as new datasets become available.

Ideally, large and diverse datasets are best for the MTO method as
shown by the results of the AOP—CMB parameters. However, for
many practical applications, the available melting temperature data
may be limited to only a small collection of sequences, which brings
the question of what are the minimal conditions for the MTO method
to work properly? Although the non—linearity introduced by Equation
(1) makes this difficult to answer precisely, a rule of thumb confirmed
by numerical experiments is that there should be more sequences than
variables. In general, ATRMS should never turn out to be smaller than
the experimental uncertainty. Therefore, optimizations that return

Salt concentration [Na+] (mM)

Fig. 3. Calculated NN parameters as function of salt concentration. All parameters were calculated independently for each salt concentration. Filled symbols con-
nected by solids lines are for AOP-OW04 and open symbols connected by dotted lines are for AOP-OW04DSC optimizations. Upper panels (a—d) are for enthalpies
and lower panels (e—h) for entropies. Panels (d) and (h) are for initiation parameters and use the right-hand scale, all other panels refer to the left-hand scale.
Parameters are grouped according to the number of hydrogen bonds per NN pair: (a) and (e) with six bonds, (b) and (f) with five bonds and (c) and (g) with four
bonds. NNs of type YpR are shown as up-pointing triangles, RpY as down-pointing triangles. RpR or YpY are shown either as bullets or boxes, except for panels
(d) and (h), which are for base pairs

Optimization method for obtaining DNA entropies and enthalpies

877

 

ATRMS z 0 are a clear sign of insufficient number of sequences in the
dataset. A practical advice in this case is to reduce the number of par—
ameters to optimize, e.g. by keeping the initiation parameters as con—
stants. When designing new sequences to be used with the MTO
method, one should favour longer sequences with a diversity of NN
configurations and with a large melting temperature range.

4 Conclusion

We presented a new method for the calculation of NN parameters
from experimental melting temperatures. Because this method side—
steps the calculation of total entropies and enthalpies, it enables us
to calculate the NN parameters under conditions, which cannot be
handled by the traditional methods. It also allows us to combine
datasets obtained under very dissimilar experimental conditions.
The results of temperature predictions show a marked improvement,
especially when larger datasets are used to calculate the parameters.

The software that implements this method is made freely available.
A comprehensive user manual is part of the package and included as
Supplementary Material. Therefore, the interested reader is provided
with ability to calculate the thermodynamic parameters for any desired
dataset. Also the availability of the source code allows for modifica—
tions for particular variants of the NN model, for instance to include
nucleation terms (Oliveira Guerra, 2013).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Currently, the best RNA—RNA interaction prediction
tools are based on approaches that consider both the inter— and
intramolecular interactions of hybridizing RNAs. While accurate,
these methods are too slow and memory-hungry to be employed
in genome-wide RNA target scans. Alternative methods neglecting
intramolecular structures are fast enough for genome-wide
applications, but are too inaccurate to be of much practical use.
Results: A new approach for RNA—RNA interaction was developed,
with a prediction accuracy that is similar to that of algorithms that
explicitly consider intramolecular structures, but running at least
three orders of magnitude faster than RNAup. This is achieved by
using a combination of precomputed accessibility profiles with an
approximate energy model. This approach is implemented in the
new version of RNAplex. The software also provides a variant using
multiple sequences alignments as input, resulting in afurther increase
in specificity.

1 INTRODUCTION

The status of RNA in molecular biology has changed dramatically
over the last decade. Instead of taking on a rather marginal role as
messenger of genomic information, they are now considered as key
regulatory elements in a wide spectrum of cellular processes. As
of 2008, the number of known non-coding RNA sequences reached
an overwhelming 29 million grouped into 1300 distinct families
(Gardner et (11., 2009).

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) frequently function by binding to
other RNAs. For example, snoRNAs mediate pseudouridylation and
methylation of rRNAs and snRNAs (Bachellerie et (11., 2002) and can
inﬂuence the splicing of pre-mRNAs (Zorio et (11., 1997). ncRNAs
are also involved in the editing of other RNA sequences (Benne,

1992), transcription and translation control (siRNA, miRNA,
stRNA) (Banerjee and Slack, 2002; Fire et (11., 1998; Kugel
and Goodrich, 2007) or plasmid replication control (Eguchi and
Tomizawa, 1990). While siRNAs are often fully complementary
to their targets, most other ncRNAs interact in a more intricate
manner, which does not involve perfect hybridization. For example
in Escherichia coli., OxyS, which is involved in oxidative stress
response, interacts with its target mRNA,fh1A, through formation
of a two sites kissing complex (Argaman and Altuvia, 2000).
Although there is statistical evidence that a plethora of ncRNAs
interacts with other RNAs (The Athanasius F. Bompfiinewerer RNA
Consortium: et (11., 2007), targets remain unknown for most of them.
The prediction of RNA—RNA interactions, therefore, has become an
important ﬁeld in computational biology.

RNA—RNA interactions are primarily governed by the same types
of hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions as RNA secondary
structure formation. The problem can, therefore, be tackled by
similar algorithmic approaches and the same parametrization of
the interaction energies. We may distinguish two distinct ways
of addressing the RNA—RNA interaction problem. The most
straightforward way consists in concatenating both sequences
and subsequently folding them as a pseudo-single sequence. The
precision of this kind of approach depends greatly on how
the concatenation is handled. The crudest approaches use linker
sequences to connect both RNA strands (Stark et (11., 2003). This
can lead to erroneous structure prediction as the linker may interfere
with the interacting sequences. Alternatively, a small modiﬁcation
of the folding algorithm keeps track of the concatenation point(s)
and uses adjusted energy parameters for the loops in which the
junctions occur (Andronescu et (11., 2003; Bernhart et (11., 2006b;
Dimitrov and Zuker, 2004; Dirks et (11., 2007; Hofacker et (11., 1994).
A combinatorially different model, known as RNA—RNA interaction
problem (RIP), covers a larger set of possible structures (Alkan et (11.,
2006; Chitsaz et (11., 2009; Huang et (11., 2010; Pervouchine, 2004).

The second type of approaches conceptually decomposes the
RNA hybridization process into two stages: (i) the unfolding of the
interacting regions of the two partners and (ii) the direct interaction
of the exposed binding sites. In practice, one ﬁrst computes the
probability of being unpaired for each region (sequence interval) in
both sequences. These probabilities are equivalent to the free energy
necessary to expose the regions. In the second step, the interaction
energy between each combinations of regions is evaluated (Busch
et (11., 2008; Muckstein et (11., 2006, 2008). This approach was,

RNAplex without considering the intramolecular structures of the RNA

22.7+26.8 249.5 kcal/mol, larger than the energy gained through binding.

fact that the interacting regions are less structured.

in particular, applied successfully to sRNA—mRNA interactions in
bacteria.

While both types of algorithms proved useﬁil in predicting the
correct interaction structure of a ncRNA with its (known) target,
they are computationally expensive, requiring at least O((n+m)3)
operations, where n and m are the size of the target and query
sequences, respectively, and hence are impractical for genome-wide
target predictions.

A drastic reduction in computational complexity can be achieved
by omitting the computation of secondary structures within the
monomers, as demonstrated by RNAhybrid (Rehmsmeier et (11.,
2004), which runs in (9(m-n-L2) when restricting the maximum
loop length to L. RNApl ex, a conceptually very similar approach
(Tafer and Hofacker, 2008), ﬁirther reduces the time complexity to
(9(m-n) by using a modiﬁed energy model. Neglecting the internal
structure of the interacting sequences leads to a drastic decrease in
speciﬁcity; however, see Figure 1. This issue is roughly addressed
by RNAplex in that it mimics the effect of the competition
between intra- and intermolecular interactions by adding a ﬁxed
per-nucleotide penalty (Tafer and Hofacker, 2008).

Currently, one therefore has to choose between precise but
impractically slow methods or fast but imprecise methods for
ncRNA target search, a situation that is quite unsatisfactory. In
this contribution, we extend the RNAplex approach Tafer and
Hofacker (2008) to tackle this problem. We mimic the effect
of the competition between intra- and intermolecular interactions
by adding a position-dependent per-nucleotide penalty instead
of a ﬁxed penalty. This penalty is derived from precomputed
accessibility proﬁles produced by RNApl fold (Bernhart et (11.,
2006a; Bompfiinewerer et (11., 2008a) or RNAup (Miickstein et (11.,

2008). More explicitly, these proﬁles contain the probabilities that
any subsequence of arbitrary length is unpaired in thermodynamic
equilibrium. These probabilities are converted to free energies that
then enter as position-dependent penalties in the computation of the
interaction energies, preserving RNAplex (9(m-n) run time. The
main advantage is that the accessibility proﬁles can be precomputed
and stored, making this approach particularly attractive for large-
scale screening studies. In addition, we extended RNAplex so that
it can also handle multiple alignment. This inclusion of comparative
information into the target prediction process leads to a substantial
increase in speciﬁcity.

2 METHODS
2.1 RNAplex novelties

The extension of RNAplex brings two novelties that increase its
speciﬁcity. First, we introduce position-speciﬁc per-nucleotide penalties
that approximate the effects of the competition between intra- and
intermolecular interactions. Second, RNAplex is now able to compute
the interactions between two alignments, allowing RNAplex to favor
evolutionary conserved interactions. Similar to the single sequence version,
the multiple sequences alignment version can also consider the accessibility
of the targets.

2.2 Approximate opening energies

We ﬁrst outline the design of RNAplex, which employs a two-steps
approach. In the ﬁrst step, the scanning phase, RNAplex identiﬁes positions
where putative interactions may end. For small interior loops (1 X 1, 2 X 1
and 2 X 2), as well as bulges of size 1, RNAplex still employs the original
look-up tables provided by the Turner Energy Model. For larger interior
loops and bulges, however, RNAplex uses a linear approximation of the
size dependence of loop energies (Tafer and Hofacker, 2008). The resulting
energy model is exact for small loops and slightly overestimates the loop
energies of large interior, bulge loops and strongly asymmetric loops. A
further advantage of the linear energy model is that RNAplex needs to store
only the last four columns of the dynamic programming matrix during the
scan phase. Once all high-scoring interactions are localized along the target
sequence, RNAplex uses the standard energy model to recompute the energy
and structure of the putative hybrids.

During the scan phase, in order to extend a hybrid by one nucleotide, we
need to know the cost of freeing this nucleotide from all the intramolecular
interactions it might be involved in. In thermodynamic equilibrium, this
energy cost can be derived from the probability that the interacting stretch
of nucleotides is unpaired. Since it is too expensive to compute this for
all intervals, we seek a step-wise procedure. Consider an intermediary
hybrid structure 8;? between two sequences x and y that starts at base
pair (xi,yj) and spans wx nucleotides of sequence x and wy nucleotides of
sequence y. We need to determine the conditional probability W‘Pi[i+wx]
that nucleotide xi+wx is not involved in any intramolecular interaction,
given that its predecessors i +wx — 1 is unpaired, and the analogous quantity
wyPﬂj—wy]. The subscript it emphasizes that the nucleotides x and y are
supposed to be unpaired. Note that this is not the same as the problem
of assessing the probability Pu[i +wx] that the individual nucleotides xi+wx
is unpaired, because base pairing probabilities of adjacent nucleotides are
highly correlated (Bompfiienewerer et (11., 2008b).

The desired conditional probability can be written as:

":‘PZIHWXI=PZ([i+le|[i.i+Wx-1]). (1)

where the notation means that the interval [i,i+wx— 1] is unpaired. An
analogous expression holds for sequence y. Using the deﬁnition of the

conditional probability, we can write:

Pﬁ([i,i+wX—1]U[i+wx]) _

WxPX - =
nll+Wx1 Pﬁ[l.’l.+WX_1] 
_ P;[i,i+w,]
_P)L§[i,i+wX—1]

Equation (2) tells us that the conditional probability w’PXM[i+wX] depends
only on the probabilities P;[i,i+wx] and Pﬁ[i,i+wx — 1] that the
corresponding intervals are unpaired. Conversely, the probability that an
intervals is unpaired can be computed from the conditional probabilities and
the probabilities that individual nucleotides are unpaired:

wX

Pgti.i+w.i=P;‘tii-1‘[1P;[i+ji (3)
j:l

A closer look at Equation (2) shows that the exact start position of the hybrid

8;? has to be known in order to compute the desired conditional probability.

Since RNAplex stores only a small number (four) of columns of the dynamic

programming matrix, this cannot be done exactly. Instead we employ the

approximation

Pﬁii.i+wX] Pzti+w.—a+1.i+w.i
Pﬁ[i,i+wX—1] Pﬁ[i+wX—6+l,i+wX—l] (4)

 

=813:[i+w).]

where 8 represents the number of nucleotides considered prior to nucleotide

xi+wx and 81—3: [i +wx] represents the conditional probability that xi+wx is

unpaired for a given (3. This approximation is exact for 8 = W), and becomes

worse with decreasing (3. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the state

of the nucleotides in the interval [i, i +wx —6+ 1] is not taken into account

for the computation of the conditional probability of nucleotide xi+wx.
Equation (3) can now be rewritten in the form

Pjii.i+w.i~

WK _X 5

3P;[i,i+w,]=P;[i,i+5—1]-H8P,[i+j] ( )
1'23

The probability Fig [i , i +wx] of being unpaired is related to a corresponding
opening energy

AG;[i,i+w,]=—RT1nP;[i,i+w,]. (6)

The energy cost of adding one nucleotide to the hybrid therefore can be
written as

ASGﬁwa] =—RT1n8F;‘[i+w,]=
AG;[i+wX—6+1,i+wx] (7)
—AG;‘[i+wx—6+1,i+wX—1].

The opening energy of a region of size of w thus is given by
MG;[i,i+w,]=—RT1n3P;[i,i+w,]=
WK
AG;[i.i+5—1]+ZASGZ[i+j]. (8)
1'28

Since RNAplex only stores the current four columns of the recursion matrix,
we set 8 :4 in practice.

2.3 Modiﬁed recursions of RNAplex

The energy A4Gi[i] of freeing nucleotide x, from all its intramolecular
interactions can now easily be integrated into the dynamic programming
recursion of RNAplex.

Let Cigj be the best interaction energy between the subsequences x1 ...xi
and yj...ym. Similarly, Bi]. and j store the optimal interactions energy

given that residue x, or residue yj, respectively, is part of a bulge; 1,», j stores
the optimal interaction energy given that x, and yj are in an interior loop.

The asymmetry penalty A models asymmetric extension of interior loops.
8(i , j,i — 1, j+ 1) represents the energy gained by stacking base pair (xi,yj)
onto (Xi+1,yj—1). M(i,j,i— 1,j+ 1) represents the mismatch energy of the
unpaired nucleotide (xi_1,yj+1) adjacent to the pair (xi,yj). The energy
contribution of the small interior loops is represented by I. Furthermore,
we use the following abbreviations for the opening energies:

(if: A4631], d; =df+A4Gj[i— 1], d; =d§+A4Gj[i—2]; and df:
A4620], dyzdf+A4Gﬁj+1L d§=d§+A4Gﬁj+2i The full dynamic
programming recursion then reads

2.4 Hybrid structure and hybrid energy

The computation of the hybrid structure and interaction energy follows
the strategy of RNAup. We assume that the binding region may contain
mismatches and bulge loops. Thus, the most stable interaction between two
segments (xi,yj) and (xk,yl) is obtained by minimizing over all possible
interior loop closed by (19,, y,,)

C(xivijxkvyl)= mill C(xivij-X]vaq)+

xk «,7 <x,~
yi>yq >11; (9)

I(x],,yq,xk,yl)+ AGﬂiJc] + AGﬂjJ]
The overall most stable interaction is then obtained by minimizing over both
duplex closing pairs (xi,yj) and (xk,yl):
Emin= min C(xivavxkaI) (10)

x1 6,, <x,‘ <xn
YI<Yf<YI<Ym
where n and m are the length of sequences x and y, respectively. This leads
to a theoretical run time of (9(n3 -m3) and a memory footprint of (9(n2 -m2).
Here we should note that one end of the hybrid, namely the base
pair (xi,yj), was already found in the scanning phase of RNAplex. As a
consequence, we only need to minimize over one closing pair instead of
two. Equation (10) can thus be rewritten as:
Emin= min C(xiijvxkvyl) (11)

x1 «k <x,~
y; <yl <ym

Equations (10) and (11) show that the knowledge of base pair (xi, yj) allows
to reduce memory and run time by a factor n-m. Furthermore, the size of

fastest application with a completion time of 27 s. RNAplex -a, i.e. the new version of RNAplex considering accessibility, needs 36 s to achieve the same
task. This grows to 120 s if one considers the time necessary to compute the accessibility proﬁle. RNAplex -a is 1000 times faster than IntaRNA (Busch

et (11., 2008) and 2422 times faster than RNAup (Miickstein et (11., 2008).

the interaction regions as well as the size of interior loops can be limited to
arbitrary lengths to and L, respectively, leading to a run time of (9(a)2 -L2)
and a memory usage of (9(w2), that is, the same complexity as RNAduplex
or RNAhybrid.

2.5 Accuracy

We evaluated the performance of RNAplex at two levels. First, we
looked at how well the opening energy derived by RNAplex from RNAup
proﬁles matched the original RNAup values. Within the model of RNA
secondary structures, this assess the quality of the approximations outlined
in the previous section compared with the exact unpairing energies. Note
that a comparison with experimentally measured opening energies is not
possible since such measurements do not appear to be available in the
published literature. The second test surveys how well RNAplex recovers
the boundaries of known duplexes. This evaluates how well the different
approximations made in RNAplex inﬂuence the quality of the predictions.
The knowledge of the exact localization of RNAiRNA interactions is
important, because ncRNAs may regulate their targets in different ways
depending on the location of the binding sites.

In order to investigate the accuracy of the accessibility proﬁles, we used
a set of 11460 randomly generated sequences of length 400 nt for which
the accessibility proﬁles was computed with RNAup. For each sequence,
we then determined the difference of the RNAup opening energy and the
RNAplex opening energy for the region located between nucleotides 181
and 200. Figure 2 shows the relative energy differences between both models
as bar plots for different values of (3. The largest variations are seen for 8 = 1
with differences larger than 100%. R2 (triangle) and the Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient (square) reach their minimum there (0.09 and 0.37, respectively).
Both coefﬁcients then steadily improve with 8 and reach their theoretical
maximum of 1 for 8 = w. For 8 < w, our approximation slightly overestimates
the opening energy. This can be seen for (3:4, the value used in RNAplex
in the scatterplot in the middle of Figure 2. Half of the relative deviation are
contained between +7% and —14%.

The accuracy of the energy model (interaction and opening energy) used
in RNAplex was compared with that of RNAup, biRNA (Chitsaz et (11.,
2009), and the old version of RNAplex (RNAplex —c) on a dataset of
17 known bacterial small RNAimRNA interactions (Chitsaz et (11., 2009)
(see Supplementary Material). In this dataset, both the opening energy of the
interacting sequences and the hybridization energy affects the prediction.

RNAplex —c (old version) missed four interactions, while all RNAplex
—a (with accessibility information) predictions overlapped with the
corresponding experimentally determined interactions, as did the predictions
of RNAup and biRNA (see Supplementary Table S2). These results
emphasize the importance of accessibility for the correct prediction of RNAi
RNA interactions. Furthermore, it conﬁrms that the approximations used in
RNAplex are sufﬁcient to reach a level of accuracy similar to that of RNAup
and biRNA.

The location of the predicted closing pairs was compared to the conﬁrmed
locations. For each prediction tool, the average over all 17 interactions
of the sum of the magnitude of the deviation between the predicted and
conﬁrmed locations of the four closing nucleotides was computed. All three
accessibility-based methods performed similarly with an average deviation
of 16.76 for RNAup, 19.88 for biRNA and 20.60 for RNAplex —a,
much smaller than the average deviation of RNAplex —c (59.76 nt) (see
Supplementary Table S2).

It should be noted that RNAup and RNAplex, in contrast to biRNA,
cannot handle interactions involving two or more interacting regions, such
as the two kissing-hairpin complexes found in OxyS-ﬂilA. Still, in contrast
to RNAup, RNAplex can return suboptimal predictions, without run time
overhead, that can be used to identify disjoint interaction regions. For OxyS-
fhlA, the conﬁrmed binding regions are located at positions [22,30] and
[98, 104] on OxyS and [87,95] and [39,45] on fhlA, in accord with the two
best suboptimals returned by RNAplex which are located on [23,28] and
[96,100] 011 OxyS and [87,92] and [41,45] onfhlA.

2.6 Computational efﬁciency

The run time of the new version of RNAplex was compared with that of
the old version (RNAplex —c, no accessibility), RNAup and IntaRNA
(Busch et (11., 2008) on a dataset containing 19 E. coli sRNAs and 100
E. coli mRNAs (see Supplementary Material). For each gene, we deﬁned
the putative target region as the sequence interval from 200 nt upstream and
1000 nt downstream of the start codon.

RNAplex completed this task in 36 5, while IntaRNA and RNAup
needed 34150 and 86487 s, respectively. The run time of RNAplex thus is
reduced by a factor of 2400 and 950 compared with RNAup and IntaRNA,
respectively. If we count the time needed to compute the accessibilities
needed by RNAplex, the total run time reaches 120 5, still more than two
orders of magnitude less than the other tools (Fig. 2).

H. Tafer et al.

 

We further compared the run time and the memory consumption of RNAup
and IntaRNA against that of the new RNAplex, by generating a set of
random target sequences of size 400, 800, 1600, 3200 and 6400 nt and query
sequences of size 100, 200, 400 and 800 nt and searching for targets with
all three tools. On this dataset, the new RNAplex is between 575 and 1600
times faster than IntaRNA and between 1500 and 65 400 times faster than
RNAup. The memory consumption is also drastically reduced. RNAplex
needs at least 17 and at most 1330 times less memory than IntaRNA ,
and 157626 times less memory than RNAup (see Supplementary Table S 1).
Compared to the old version without accessibilities, the new RNAplex needs
only four times more memory.

2.7 Conserved interactions

The absence of conserved target site in closely related species may indicate
that the proposed interaction does not occur in nature. The presence of
compensatory mutations between the sRNA and the target site, on the other
hand, can lend further credibility to single sequence target predictions (Chen
et (11., 2007). Alignments thus can improve the speciﬁcity of target search by
focusing on evolutionary conserved interactions.

We, therefore, extended RNAplex to alignments. The approach follows
the same idea as RNAali fold (Bernhart et (11., 2008; Hofacker 21111., 2002),
where a thermodynamic energy minimization folding algorithm is coupled
with a simple scoring model to assess structural evolutionary conservation.
Base pairs are, therefore, restricted to pairs of positions in the alignments in
which most or all sequences can form canonical pairs.

The evolutionary model used in RNAplex, while straightforward,
performs well in predicting consensus secondary structure. Its simplicity
allows it to be integrated into RNAplex without run time overhead (see
Supplementary Material).

A potential weakness is the RNAalifold scoring model, which
was trained and optimized for intramolecular interaction, instead for the
intermolecular interactions to which it is applied here. More complex
scoring schemes such as the one used in PETfold and PETcofold,
where a maximum expected scoring approach combines the evolutionary
probabilities of a consensus structure given an alignment with the
thermodynamic probabilities of the associated structures in each sequence
(Seemann et (11., 2008, 2010, 2011), perform slightly better than the
RNAali fold scoring scheme. However, they can be incorporated only
at the cost of a greatly increased run time, and thus are incompatible with
the purpose of RNAplex.

Similar to the single sequence version, the alignment version of RNAplex
only allows interior loops in the RNAiRNA hybrids. Like the single
sequence, accessibility can be taken into account by averaging the position-
dependent extension costs computed for the individual sequences in the
alignment (see Supplementary Materials for a full description of the
recursion).

3 APPLICATION

As an application example, we consider the genome-wide prediction
of sRNA targets in E. coli. As a reference set, we use the
experimentally conﬁrmed interactions published by Urban et (11.
(2007). We expect that, for a given sRNA, the number of predicted
interactions with other (false positive) targets should decrease when
accessibility of the target mRNA in included. Ideally, it should reach
the low levels observed for RNAup (Miickstein et (11., 2008).

For each sRNA, the amount of false positives was estimated
by counting genome wide the number of sRNA-target interactions

that are more stable than the experimentally reported sRNA-target
duplex. For each 4463 E. coli genes, a mRNA of length 1200 nt,
including 200 nt upstream and 1000 nt downstream of the start
codon were deﬁned. Accessibility proﬁles were computed with
RNApl fold, with a folding windows (option —W) of 240 nt and
a maximal base pair distance of 160 (option —L). An interaction
was reported if the corresponding sRNA—mRNA interaction energy
is smaller than the experimentally conﬁrmed interaction, and if
it occurs in region encompassing 80 nt, 50 nt upstream and 30 nt
downstream of the start codon.

The inclusion of the accessibility proﬁles in the new version of
RNAplex leads to a substantial improvement as can be seen from
Table 1. All native interaction sites are among the predictions, and
the detailed target site localization is improved. Most importantly,
the number of predictions with better interaction energies, i.e. the
false positives, is reduced to a level similar to that of RNAup.

In order to better assess the number of false positives, the
same method was applied on the dinucleotide-shufﬂed sRNAs
and mRNAs. To this end, we compared the interaction energy
of the non-shufﬂed, experimentally conﬁrmed interactions, to the
energy distribution of the shufﬂed sequences. Interestingly, in seven
out of nine cases, the number of false positives is smaller (see
Supplementary Material) in the shufﬂed case than in the non-shufﬂed
one. This can be explained by the fact that in various bacteria, the
region around the ribosomal entry site, which is also the preferred
region of sRNA binding, is more accessible than the rest of the
mRNA (see Supplementary Material). This in turn implies that
compared with shufﬂed sequences, sRNAs have a greater chance to
bind to the region around the start codon in non-shufﬂed mRNAs.
Depending on the ncRNAs, one can expect between 7.5 X 10_7 false
positives per nucleotide for micC and 1.5 X 10—4 false positives for
gch (see Supplementary Material).

3.1 Multiple alignment

While RNApl ex recovers all interactions, some of them like RyhB-
sodB or chB-oppA are ranked lowly. A comparative version of
RNAplex was designed (see Section 2) to reduce the number of
false positives. Similar to consensus RNA folding, the quality of the
input alignments is crucial to obtain meaningful results (Bernhart
et (11., 2008).

The comparison of the performance of the single sequence with
the comparative version of RNApl ex was achieved by generating
multiple sequences alignments clustalw (Larkin et (11., 2007) for
the eight sRNAs from Table 1 and with MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004)
for the 4463 E. coli mRNAs. The list of bacteria used for the
alignment are found in the Supplementary Material.

In many cases, MUSCLE and clustalw were not able
to satisfactorily align the sequences. This was caused e.g. by
misannotations of the start codon as for the ompA gene in E. col i
APEC 01, which was incorrectly annotated 70 nt upstream of the
true start codon. In order to better handle these cases, we devised
a method to produce multiple alignments of highly similar and
strongly binding target sites (see Supplementary Materials).

Because highly conserved interactions are more credible than non-
conserved interactions, ranking of interactions based on multiple
sequences alignments should not only take the interaction energy
into account, but also the number of organisms (in which a predicted
interactions is detectable). This can be achieved by using Z-scores

The ﬁrst and second columns show the name of interaction partners. Columns 3 and 4 give the predicted and experimentally reported binding regions, respectively. Columns 5 and
6 report the binding AG computed by RNAup and RNAplex, respectively. The numbers in parenthesis in the sixth column represent the number of interactions, located within a
window of 80 nt centered around the start codon, with a lower interaction energy than the experimentally reported interaction for the predictions made by RNAplex with and without
considering the opening energy, respectively. Column 7 gives the interaction energy for the multiple sequences interactions. The numbers in parenthesis in column 7 represent the
number of sequences in the ﬁnal alignments. Column 8 shows the rank of the interaction when looking only at the interaction energy. Column 9 shows the rank of the interactions
based on the Z-score corrected for the number of sequences in the alignment. Finally, column 10 shows the rank of the interaction based on the Z-score, given that only interactions
with a greater or equal number of sequences in the alignment are taken into account. The number in parenthesis in the last column represent the number of better scoring elements

in the case of alignment when no accessibility information are taken into account.

as alternative ranking criterion. The Z-scores can be computed
for all interactions having the same number of sequences in the
alignments. This is important as highly conserved interactions tend
to have a higher consensus interaction energy than interactions that
are conserved in only few organisms (see Supplementary Figure S2).

In this way, extremely stable interactions can be compared
without having to worry about the number of sequences in the
alignments. The main drawback of this method is that highly
conserved interactions with more than 10 sequences are rare, making
the Z-score analysis unreliable. This is the case, for example, for the
micA-ompA pair, which has the highest interaction energy among
the interactions involving 14 species. In this case, the rank of MicA
drops from 2 for the single sequence approach to 11 for the alignment
approach.

Table 1 shows that the rank based on the interaction energy
or the Z-score is similar to that of the single sequence energy
ranking. However, when considering only interactions having a
greater or equal number of sequences and a higher Z-score (column
10), the number of interactions that score better than the native
one in the single sequence case (column 6) decreases signiﬁcantly,
with the greatest reduction being seen for ryhB. This is especially
interesting because the ryhB-sodB is difﬁcult to predict, probably
due to its dependence upon qu, a protein known to facilitate sRNA—
mRNA duplex formation (Sittka et (11., 2007). Similar to the single
sequence case, the use of accessibility information in the case of
multiple sequences alignments allows to improve the rank of the
known interactions. This can be seen in the last column of Table 1.

It should be noted that some false positives turned out to be real
interactions: for example, iscS and (1an score better than sodB as
targets for ryhB and are true targets (Desnoyers et (11., 2009; Masse
and Gottesman, 2002). Similar trends can be seen if the Z-score
threshold is set to 0 and the number of sequences in the multiple
alignment remains unchanged. If we look at the gene ontology
of these targets in the case of ryhB (43 targets), we see that 35
are involved in catalytic activities (P=0.006), 9 are involved in
iron—sulfur cluster binding (P =0.007), 39 are involved in binding

(P = 0.01). ryhB targets are also signiﬁcantly overrepresented in the
C02 ﬁxation (P = 0.0001) as well as citrate cycle cellular pathways
(P = 0.0002), in line with the gene ontology analysis. More examples
can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

4 DISCUSSION

We presented a new version of RNAplex, a tool designed to
rapidly and reliably predict RNA—RNA interactions. Compared
with the previously published version, RNAplex now considers
target site accessibility, by using accessibility proﬁles generated by
RNApl fold to approximate the energy of removing a nucleotide
from all intramolecular interactions. The introduction of position-
speciﬁc, structure-dependent extension cost allows to greatly
improve the speciﬁcity of RNAplex, bringing it close to that
of RNAup, without modifying the linear run time of the original
RNApleX.

Clearly, the main feature of RNAplex is its run time efﬁciency.
On a dataset of 19 ncRNAs and 100 target mRNAs on length 1200,
RNAplex runs 2400 faster than RNAup without noticeably loss of
speciﬁcity, thus making ncRNAs target searches more affordable.
In its present implementation, RNAplex can be used not only to
predict ncRNA targets in small genomes, but can also be used
to ﬁnd miRNA targets and siRNA off-targets in large mammalian
genomes and transcriptomes and it can be applied to microarray
probes design. In contrast to RNAup or RNAhybrid, RNApleX
can return suboptimal solutions efﬁciently on the ﬂy without the
need of recomputing the full recursion matrix.

The ability of RNAplex to perform comparative target search
allows to discard poorly conserved interaction and to lend further
credibility to interactions showing compensatory mutations. Based
on a dataset of experimentally conﬁrmed interactions, we show that
RNAplex in its present form is an useﬁil tool to predict new sRNA
targets. We ﬁirther show that suboptimal predictions from RNAplex
may actually be real targets. Application of the comparative version

of RNAplex on larger genomes and other ncRNAs, e.g. miRNAs,
is straightforward.

In order to make RNAplex more usable for the community,
we plan to set up a web server especially designed to predict
targets for sRNAs in bacteria. We ﬁirther plan to use RNApl ex to
better understand the regulatory circuits found in E. col i (Shimoni
et (11., 2007). Finally, a probe design method based on RNAplex is
currently being developed.

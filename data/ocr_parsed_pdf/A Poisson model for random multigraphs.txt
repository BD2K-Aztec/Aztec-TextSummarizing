ABSTRACT

Motivation: Biological networks are often modeled by random
graphs. A better modeling vehicle is a multigraph where each
pair of nodes is connected by a Poisson number of edges.
In the current model, the mean number of edges equals the
product of two propensities, one for each node. In this context
it is possible to construct a simple and effective algorithm for
rapid maximum likelihood estimation of all propensities. Given
estimated propensities, it is then possible to test statistically for
functionally connected nodes that show an excess of observed
edges over expected edges. The model extends readily to directed
multigraphs. Here, propensities are replaced by outgoing and
incoming propensities.

Results: The theory is applied to real data on neuronal connections,
interacting genes in radiation hybrids, interacting proteins in a
literature curated database, and letter and word pairs in seven
Shaskespearean plays.

1 INTRODUCTION

Random graph theory has proved vital in modeling the internet
and Constructing biological and social networks. In the original
formulation of the theory by Erdos and Renyi (1959, 1960), there
are three key assumptions: (a) a graph exhibits at most one edge
between any two nodes; (b) the formation of a given edge is
independent of the formation of other edges; and (C) all edges form
with the same probability. There is a general agreement that this
simple model is too rigid to capture many real-world networks
(Albert and Barabasi, 2002; Strogatz, 2001). The surveys (Barabasi
and Albert, 1999; Durrett, 2006; Newman et (11., 2001) summarize
some of the elaborations and applications of two generations of
scholars, with emphasis on power laws, phase transitions and
SCale-free networks. In the current article, we study a multigraph

extension of the Erdos—Renyi model appropriate for very large
networks. Our model speciﬁcally relaxes assumptions (a) and (C).
With appropriate alternative assumptions in place, we derive and
illustrate a novel maximum likelihood algorithm for estimation of
the model parameters. With these parameters in hand, we are then
able to ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant connections between pairs of
nodes.

In practice many graphs are derived from multigraphs. To simplify
analysis, the multiple edges between two nodes of a multigraph are
collapsed to a single edge. The movie star example in reference
(Newman et al., 2001) is typical. In the movie star graph, two actors
are connected by an edge when they appear in the same movie.
Some actor pairs will appear in a movie mostly by Chance. Other
actor pairs will be connected by multiple edges because they are
intrinsically linked. Classic pairs such as Abbot and Costello, Loy
and Powell, and Lewis and Martin come to mind.

The well-studied neural network of Caemorhabditis elegans is
a prime biological example. Here neuron pairs are connected by
multiple synapses. Because collapsing edges wastes information,
it is better to tackle the multiplicity issue directly. Thus, we will
deal with random multigraphs. For our purposes, these exclude
loops and fractional edge weights. Instead of a Bernoulli number
of edges between any two nodes as in the Erdos and Rényi model,
we postulate a Poisson number of edges. This Choice can be viewed
as unnecessarily restrictive, but it is worth recalling that a Poisson
distribution can approximate a binomial or normal distribution.
Furthermore, the Poisson assumption allows an arbitrary mean
number of edges.

In relaxing assumption (C) above, we want to introduce as few
parameters as possible but still Capture the capacity of some nodes
to serve as hubs. Thus, we assign to eaCh node i a propensity p,-
to form edges. The random number of edges Xl-j between nodes i
and j is then taken to be Poisson distributed with mean pipj. Node
pairs with high propensities will have many edges, pairs with low
propensities will have few edges, and pairs with one high and one
low propensity will have intermediate numbers of edges. Later, we
will show that these Choices promote simple and rapid estimation of
the propensities. Another virtue of the model is that it generalizes to
direCted graphs where arcs replace edges. For direCted graphs, we
postulate an outgoing propensity p,- and an inComing propensity q,-
for eaCh node i. The number of arcs Xij from i to j is taken to be
Poisson distributed with mean piqj. In the direCted version of the
model, the two random variables Xl-j and Xﬁ are distinguished. In
aCCOrd with assumption (b), the random counts Xij in either model
are taken to be independent.

Random multigraphs

 

Protein and gene networks can involve tens of thousands of
nodes. Estimation of propensities under the Poisson multigraph
model for such networks is consequently problematic. Standard
algorithms for parameter estimation such as least squares, Newton’s
method and Fisher scoring require computing, storing and inverting
large Hessian matrices. Such actions are not really options in
high-dimensional problems. One of the biggest challenges in the
present article is crafting an alternative estimation algorithm that
remains viable in high dimensions. Fortunately, the MM (minorize—
maximize) principle (Lange, 2004; Lange et (11., 2000) allows one to
design a simple iterative algorithm for the random multigraph model.
Large matrices are avoided and convergence is reasonably fast. In
the appendix, we prove that the new MM algorithm converges to
the global maximum of the likelihood.

Another strength of the model is that it permits assessment
of statistical signiﬁcance. In other words, it helps distinguish
random connectivity from ﬁmctional connectivity. The basic idea
is very simple. Every edge count Xij is Poisson distributed with
a parameterized mean. If we substitute estimated propensities for
theoretical propensities, then we can estimate the mean and therefore
approximate the tail probability p=Pr(Xij3xl-j) associated with
the observed number of edges xl-j between two nodes i and j.
The smaller this probability, the less likely these edges occur
entirely by chance. For instance, in the movie star example, the
actor pair Abbot and Costello would be ﬂagged as signiﬁcant in
any representative dataset of their era. In less obvious examples,
discerning functionally connected pairs is more challenging. In the
appendix (Supplementary Material), we show how to approximate
very low P-values under the Poisson distribution.

To test the model, we analyze ﬁve real datasets. Three of these
are biological and involve undirected graphs. The ﬁrst is the neural
network of C.e1eg(1ns (Watts and Strogatz, 1998; White et (11., 1986)
already mentioned. The second is a network obtained by subjecting
a panel of radiation hybrids to gene expression measurements
(Ahn et (11., 2009; Park et (11., 2008). In the network two genes
are connected by an edge if a marker signiﬁcantly regulates the
expression levels of both genes in the clones of the panel. Our
third biological example involves interacting proteins taken from
the curated Human Protein Reference Database (Keshava Prasad
et (11., 2009). For directed graphs, we turn to literary analysis of a
subset of Shakespeare’s plays. Here, we look at letter pairs and word
pairs. Every time the ﬁrst letter of a pair precedes the second letter
of a pair in a word, we introduce an arc between them. Likewise,
every time the ﬁrst word of a pair precedes the second word of a pair
in a sentence, we introduce an arc between them. Other applications
such as monitoring internet trafﬁc come immediately to mind but
will not be treated here.

Let us stress the exploratory nature of the Poisson multigraph
model. Its purpose is to probe large datasets for hidden structure.
Identifying hub nodes and node pairs with excess edges are primary
goals. The fact that the model is at best, a cartoon does not eliminate
these possibilities. For example, even if we do not take the P-values
generated by the model seriously, they can still serve to rank
important node pairs for ﬁirther investigation and experimentation.
Computational biology is full of compromises between realistic
models and computational feasibility.

Before tackling these speciﬁc examples, we will brieﬂy review
the MM principle and lay out the details of the model. Once this
foundation is in place, we show how a simple inequality drives

the optimization process. The MM principle is designed to steadily
increase the log-likelihood of the model given the data. This ascent
property is the key to understanding how the algorithm operates.

2 BACKGROUND ON THE MM ALGORITHM

As we have already emphasized, the MM algorithm is a principle
for creating algorithms rather than a single algorithm. There are
two versions of the MM principle, one for iterative minimization
and another for iterative maximization. Here, we deal only with
the maximization version. Let L(p) be the objective ﬁmction we
seek to maximize. An MM algorithm involves minorizing L(p) by
a surrogate ﬁmction g(p | p") anchored at the current iterate p" of a
search. Minorization is deﬁned by the two properties

L(p") = g(p"|p") (1)
L(p) 2 g(p|p"), p#p"- (2)

In other words, the surface pl—>g(p|p") lies below the surface
pl—>L(p) and is tangent to it at the point p=p". Construction of
the surrogate function g(p|p") constitutes the ﬁrst M of the MM
algorithm.

In the second M of the algorithm, we maximize the surrogate
function g(p | p") rather than L(p). If p"""1 denotes the maximum
point of g(p|p"), then this action forces the ascent property
L(p"+1)3L(p"). The straightforward proof

L(p"+1> 2 g(p"+1lp"> 2 g(p"|p") = up").

reﬂects deﬁnitions (1) and (2) and the choice of p"+1. The ascent
property is the source of the MM algorithm’s numerical stability.
Strictly speaking, it depends only on increasing g(p|p"), not on
maximizing g(p | p").

The celebrated EM algorithm (Dempster et (11., 1977) is a special
case of the MM algorithm (Lange, 2004; Lange et (11 ., 2000). The EM
algorithm always relies on some notion of missing data. Discerning
the missing data in a statistical problem is sometimes easy and
sometimes hard. In our Poisson graph model, it is unclear what
constitutes the missing data. In contrast, derivation of a reliable MM
algorithm is straightforward but ad hoc. Readers wanting a more
systematic derivation are apt to be disappointed. In our defense, it
is possible to codify several successful strategies for constructing
surrogate ﬁmctions (Hunter and Lange, 2004; Lange, 2004; Lange
et (11., 2000).

3 METHODS

Consider a random multigraph with m nodes labeled 1,2,  A random
number of edges Xij connects every pair of nodes {1, j}. We assume that
the Xij are independent Poisson random variables with means 11,7. As a
plausible model for ranking nodes, we take 11,]- :pipj, where p, and p]- are
non-negative propensities. The log-likelihood of the observed edge counts

be limited to those nodes j with xi]- > 0. Observe that these sums need only

A similar MM algorithm can be derived for a Poisson model of arc
formation in a directed multigraph. We now postulate a donor propensity
pi and a recipient propensity qj for arcs extending from node i to node j. If
the number of such arcs Xij is Poisson distributed with mean piqj, then under
independence we have the log-likelihood

Again these are computationally simple to implement and map positive
parameters to positive parameters. It is important to observe that the log-
likelihood L(p, q) is invariant under the rescaling 017, and c-1 qj for a positive
constant c and all i and j. This fact suggests that we ﬁx one propensity and
omit its update.

To derive a reasonable starting value in the undirected multigraph model,
we maximize L(p) under the assumption that all p, coincide. This gives the

The same conclusion can be reached by equating theoretical and sample
means. In the directed multigraph model, we maximize L(p, q) subject to the
restriction that all p, and qj coincide. Now we have

Note that the ﬁxed parameter is determined by this initialization.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Caernorhabditis elegans neural network

The neural network of Celegans is a classic dataset ﬁrst studied
by White et (11. (1986) and later by Watts and Strogatz (1998). In
their paper, White et (11. were able to obtain high-resolution electron
microscopic images. This allowed them to identify all the synapses,
map all the connections and to work out the entire neuronal network
of the worm. To use all known connections in our analysis, we
add as edges the electric junctions and neuromuscular junctions
observed by Chen et (11. (2006). For consistency, we disregard the
directionality of the chemical synapses. In our opinion, the ﬂexibility
of the model in accepting different deﬁnitions of edges should be
viewed as a strength. We declare a connection between two neurons
1' and j to be functionally signiﬁcant when Pr(Xl-j:xij)§10_6.
Figure 1 in the Appendix (Supplementary Material) depicts the
network.

As recorded in Table 1, many of the most signiﬁcant connections
extend between motor neurons. The model also captures the bilateral
symmetry between the right and left sides of the worm. Thus, the
connections between the pairs RIPR-IL2VR and RIPL-IL2VL and
between OLLL-AVEL and OLLR-AVER are all signiﬁcant. Note
that an L or an R at the end of a neuron’s name signiﬁes the left
and right side, respectively. The right neuron PDER appears twice
on the top 50 list and its left counterpart PDEL is missing, but
both have the same number of signiﬁcant edges overall. Although
these dual connections are highlighted as about equally signiﬁcant
in our analysis, the corresponding propensity estimates show a left—
right imbalance. The cause of these slight departures from bilateral
symmetry is obscure. In any event, the model is subtle enough to
distinguish between high edge counts and signiﬁcant edge counts.
Thus, even though one pair of nodes may have more edges than
another pair, it does not necessarily imply that the ﬁrst pair is more
signiﬁcantly connected than the second pair.

4.2 Radiation hybrid gene network

Radiation hybrids were originally devised as a tool for gene mapping
(Goss and Harris, 1975) at the chromosome level. The detailed
physical maps they ultimately provided (Cox et (11 ., 1990) served as
a scaffolding for sequencing the entire human genome. To construct
radiation hybrids, one irradiates cells from a donor species. This
fragments the chromosomes and kills the vast majority of cells. A
few donor cells are rescued by ﬁising them with cells of a recipient
species. Some of the fragments, say 10%, get translocated or inserted
into the chromosomes of the recipient species. The hybrid cells have
no particular growth advantage over the more numerous unfused
recipient cells. However, if cells from the recipient cell line lack an
enzyme such as hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT)
or thymidine kinase (TK), both the unfused and the hybrid cells
can be grown in a selective medium that eliminates the unfused
recipient cells. This selection process leaves a few hybrid cells,
and each of the hybrid cells serves as a progenitor of a clone of
identical cells. Each clone contains a random subset of the genome
of the donor species. The presence or absence of a particular short
region can be assayed by testing for a donor marker in that region.
A given donor marker is present in a given clone in 0, 1 or 2
copies.

It turns out that one can exploit radiation hybrids to map QTLs
(quantitative trait loci). We measured the log intensities of 232 626
aCGH (array comparative genomic hybridization) markers and
20 145 gene expression levels in each of 99 mouse—hamster radiation
hybrids (Ahn et (11., 2009; Park et (11., 2008). In this case, a
mouse served as the donor and a hamster as the recipient. We
then regressed the mouse gene expression levels on the mouse
copy numbers recorded for each of the mouse markers. Altogether
this amounts to about 5 X 109 separate linear regressions. We
constructed a multigraph from the data by analogy with the movie

star example, with genes corresponding to actors and markers
to movies. An edge is added between two genes if both genes
showed statistically signiﬁcant dependence on the marker at the
level P 3 10‘9. This strict P-value cutoff was chosen to produce an
easily visualized graph. Because the aCGH markers densely cover
the mouse genome, a quasi-peak ﬁnding algorithm was used to
delete the excess edges occurring under a common linkage peak.
Figure 2 in the Appendix (Supplementary Material) depicts the ﬁill
network. Here, node size is proportional to estimated propensity
and edge darkness is proportional to signiﬁcance. Red edges
are the most signiﬁcant. Even with a very stringent signiﬁcance
level and elimination of edges by peak ﬁnding, there are still
729 169 signiﬁcant connections.

Figure 1 shows an interesting subnetwork with highly signiﬁcant
edges, genes (nodes) of large propensity, and genes with related
functions. The Dishevelled 1 (Dvll) member of this subnetwork is
part of the wingless/Int (Wnt) signaling pathway. The Wnt pathway
has a reciprocal signaling relationship with the hedgehog pathway,
which requires oxysterols for optimal ﬁinction (Corcoran et (11.,
2009). The Wnt hedgehog connection is important in stem cell
renewal. Interestingly, oxysterol binding protein-like 3 (Osbpl3) is
a member of the subnetwork as well as Dvll. Furthermore, the
subnetwork contains two membrane-associated proteins: mucolipin
3 (Mcoln3), a cation channel protein (Cuajungco and Samie, 2008)
and aquaporin 2 (qu2), a water channel protein (Carbrey and
Agre, 2009). An emerging theme in cancer research is the notion
of evolving genetic networks (Maxwell et (11., 2008). Networks
constructed using the Poisson multigraph model can robustly
identify unexpected connections with known oncogene pathways
such as the Wnt pathway. These connections may ultimately suggest
novel therapeutic strategies.

4.3 Protein interactions via literature curation

With the advent of high-throughput experimentation, an enormous
mass of information on protein interactions has accumulated.
Because there was initially no universal format for presenting
interactions, many of the early discoveries were useﬁil only to the
originating labs. This bottleneck forced coordination and eventually
the construction of uniﬁed databases with ﬁxed formats combining
all of the published information. A notable example of this process of
curation is the Human Protein Reference Database (Keshava Prasad
et (11., 2009). We downloaded Release 7 of the database and analyzed
it with the random multigraph model.

Several interesting features of the data emerge under a P-value
cutoff of 10_6. For instance, the protein with the most observed
edges, TP53, turns out to be different from the protein with the most
signiﬁcant edges, Stat3. In fact, none of the top ﬁve proteins ranked
by the most observed edges are in the top ﬁve proteins ranked by
the most signiﬁcant edge counts. Thus, the hub nodes of the raw
data differ sharply from the hub nodes of the processed data. The
two most extreme cases, YWHAG and CREBBP, have no signiﬁcant
edge counts despite being ranked fourth and ﬁfth based on observed
edges (Tables 2 and 3). One should be cautious in interpreting such
results because molecular experiments are hypothesis driven and
generate very biased data. The value of looking for signiﬁcance is
that it turns up hidden structure, not that it calls into question known
structure.

When we cluster proteins by signiﬁcant edge counts, the TP53
protein is especially interesting. Consider the small component
containing TP53 shown in Figure 2. We analyzed this cluster using
the BiNGO addition to Cytoscape (Maere et (11., 2005). BiNGO
computes the probability that x or more genes in a given set of
genes shares the same GO (gene ontology) category. Altogether
we found 30 signiﬁcant GO categories with P<10_6; most of

4.4 Word pairs and letter pairs

Identifying frequently used word pairs in literary texts can be useﬁil
in problems of literary attribution and in the identiﬁcation of word
fossils. Vocabulary richness and frequencies of sets of words have
been studied in many different literary contexts using a variety of
methods, including, for example, Bayesian analysis and machine
learning to determine authorship of the Federalist papers (Holmes
and Forsyth, 1995; Mosteller and Wallace, 1984), and likelihood
ratio tests to study the Pearl poems (McColly and Weier, 1983).
Recent investigations of long texts (Bemhardsson et al., 2009) have
called into question Zipf’s law (Zipf, 1932), which postulates that
the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in
usage. Here, we apply the Poisson model of graph connectivity to
study pairs of words used consecutively in a set of Shakespeare’s
plays.

Our version of word pair analysis begins by scanning a literary
work and creating a dictionary of words found in the text. An arc
is drawn between two consecutive words, from the ﬁrst word to
the second word of the text, provided the words are not separated
by a punctuation mark. The number of arcs between an ordered
pair of words is counted and stored in a square matrix with
dimensions equal to the number of unique words in the text. We
chose seven of Shakespeare’s plays, All ’s Well that Ends Well, As You
Like It, Julius Caesar, King Lear, Macbeth, Measure for Measure
and Titus Andronicus, concatenated them, and analyzed them as a
whole. Contractions such as ‘o’er’ and ‘ta’en’ were replaced by
the corresponding ﬁill words, ‘over’ and ‘taken’, respectively. We
retained in our analysis word pairs constituting character names.

We calculated the observed frequency of each word pair. Based
on the directed random multigraph model described in Section 3,
we estimated the outgoing and incoming propensities for each word
along with expected frequencies and P-values for each word pair.
Table 5 lists the most connected word pairs in the text ranked by
their P-values. This set is dominated by phrases that are commonly
used in the language of the day, such as ‘I am’ and ‘my lord’, and
by character names, such as ‘Lady Macbeth’ and ‘Second Lord’, in
each play.

One can identify several word pairs whose members almost never
occur separately by examining the ratio xl-j/ (131-20) of observed to
expected word pair frequencies. Table 6 lists several examples
ranked by this index. These word pair fossils are dominated by a
few phrases still in common use such as ‘pell mell’ and ‘tick tack’
as well as various Latin and Italian phrases, such as ‘et tu Brute’,
and other strange phrases speciﬁc to the context of particular plays,
such as ‘boarish fangs’ and ‘rustic revelry’.

In addition, we studied pairs of letters encountered consecutively
in the combined text of the Shakespearean plays. Figure 3 depicts
the letter pair connections using a very stringent P-value of 10—19
for display purposes. Table 7 lists the same results in tabular form.
The two most signiﬁcant pairs are ‘th’ and ‘he’. One would expect
much more stability over time of letter pair usage than word pair
usage. This contention is borne out by our separate analysis of the
novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Multigraphs are inherently more informative than ordinary graphs,
and random multigraphs offer rich possibilities for modeling
biological, social and communication networks. Our applications are
meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive. Graphical models will
surely grow in importance as research laboratories and corporations
gather ever larger datasets and hire ever more computer scientists

and statisticians to mine them. The Poisson model has many
advantages. It is ﬂexible enough to capture hub nodes and functional
connectivity, generalizes to directed graphs, and sustains an MM
estimation algorithm capable of handling enormous numbers of
nodes. It is also very quick computationally as measured by total
iterations and total time until convergence. A glance at Table 1 of the
Appendix (Supplementary Material) suggests that 20—30 iterations
sufﬁce for convergence. To thrive, data mining must balance model
realism with model computability. In our opinion, the Poisson model
achieves this end. Of course, other distributions for edge counts
could be tried, for instance the binomial or the negative binomial,
but they would be even less well motivated and less adapted to fast
estimation.

It is natural to place our advances in the larger context of
applied random graph theory. For instance, early on social scientists
married latent variable models and random networks (Holland
and Leinhardt, 1981). Stochastic blockmodels assign nodes either
deterministically or stochastically to latent classes (Airoldi et al.,
2008; Holland et al., 1983; Newman and Leicht, 2007; Nowicki
and Snijders, 2001; Wang and Wong, 1987). Alternatively, a latent
distance model sets up a social space and estimates the distances
between node pairs in this space (Hoff et al., 2002). It is possible
to combine features of both latent class and latent distance models
in a single eigenmodel (Hoff, 2008). The ‘attract and introduce’
model is another helpful elaboration (Fowler et al., 2009). None of
these models focuses on multigraphs. Furthermore, most classical
applications involve networks of modest size. However, under the
stimulus of large internet datasets, the ﬁeld of random networks is
in rapid ﬂux. Going forward it will be a challenge to turn the rising
ﬂood of data into useﬁil information. Importing more of the social
science contributions into biological research may pay substantial
dividends.

In practice, most large networks contain an excess of weak
interactions. The radiation hybrid data are typical in this regard.
To sift through the data, it is helpful to focus on hub nodes
and strong interactions. The Poisson multigraph model provides
a rigorous way of doing so. The model’s ﬂexibility in allowing
different sorts of edges is appealing if not taken to extremes.
When conﬁdence in edge assignment varies widely across edge
deﬁnitions, a weighted graph model might be a better modeling
device than a multigraph model. However, converting a multigraph
to a weighted graph has its own problems. For instance, there
is more than one way to make the conversion. An even bigger
disadvantage of weighted graph models is their tendency to ignore
the stochastic nature of node formation. This is a hindrance
in assessing ﬁinctional connections and suggests an opportunity
for more nuanced modeling. To be competitive with Poisson
multigraphs, a good stochastic model for weighted graphs should
support fast estimation of parameters. One substitute for Poisson
randomness is to condition on the degree of each node (Chung
and Lu, 2002). Within these constraints, one can randomize edge
placement. This perspective lends itself to permutation testing
but not to parameter estimation (Maslov and Sneppen, 2002).
Unfortunately, the computational cost of generating the required
permutations limits the chances for approximating very small
P-values and hence ranking connections by P-values.

The random multigraph model raises as many questions as it
answers. How closely is it tied to the Poisson distribution? How
closely is it tied to the propensity parameterization of edge means?

Can predictors be incorporated that determine propensities? More
importantly, what applications would beneﬁt from this sort of
modeling? We are content to raise these issues, with the hope that
other computational and mathematical scientists can be enlisted
over time to resolve them and related problems beyond our current
understanding.

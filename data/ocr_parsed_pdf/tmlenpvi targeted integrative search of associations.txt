Abstract

Summary: We describe the implementation of the method introduced by Chambaz et al. in 2012.
We also demonstrate its genome—wide application to the integrative search of new regions with
strong association between DNA copy number and gene expression accounting for DNA methyla—
tion in breast cancers.

Availability and implementation: An open—source R package tmle.npvi is available from CRAN

1 Introduction

Looking for genes whose DNA copy number is ‘associated with’
their expression level in a cancer study can help pinpoint candidates
implied in the disease and enhance our understanding of its molecu-
lar bases. Genomic covariates may play an important role in the bio-
logical process and should therefore be taken into account. For
instance, DNA methylation is known to regulate gene expression.
To quantify the association between DNA copy number and expres-
sion, accounting for such relevant genomic covariates, Chambaz
et a1. (2012) have crafted a new parameter and built a method to
infer it upon the targeted minimum loss-based inference principle
(TMLE). Coined by van der Laan and Rubin (2006), TMLE has
been applied in a variety of contexts (van der Laan and Rose, 2011).
In this note, we describe the implementation of this method and its
genome-wide, integrative application.

Considering associations between DNA copy numbers and
expression levels in genes is not new (Andrews et (11., 2010;
Louhimo and Hautaniemi, 2011; Pollack et (11., 2002; Sun et (11.,
2011; van Wieringen and van de Wiel, 2008). In contrast to these
earlier contributions, ours does explicitly exploit that DNA copy

number measurements feature both a reference level and a con-
tinuum of other levels, instead of discretizing them or considering
them as purely continuous. Moreover, we naturally handle multi-
dimensional, continuous covariates without discretization. We do
not need to assume that they are normally distributed, nor
that their true effect on DNA copy number and gene expression is
linear.

Methods

2.1 Presentation

We first define the statistical parameter that we wish to target. Let 0
:  X. Y) be a generic observation, where W, X and Y are respect-
ively the covariates (e.g. DNA methylation), DNA copy number and ex-
pression of a gene of interest in a randomly picked biological sample.
Let x() be a reference value for X, corresponding to the normal state of 2
DNA copies. We assume that the probability to observe X : x0 is
bounded away from O and I. We assume without loss of generality that
x0 : O. In the absence of additional solid knowledge regarding the law
of O, we decide to focus on the following nonparametric variable

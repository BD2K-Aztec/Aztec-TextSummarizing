ABSTRACT

Summary: The ModuLand plug-in provides Cytoscape users an
algorithm for determining extensively overlapping network modules.
Moreover, it identifies several hierarchical layers of modules, where
meta-nodes of the higher hierarchical layer represent modules of the
lower layer. The tool assigns module cores, which predict the function
of the whole module, and determines key nodes bridging two or
multiple modules. The plug-in has a detailed JAVA-based graphical
interface with various colouring options. The ModuLand tool can run
on Windows, Linux or Mac 08. We demonstrate its use on protein
structure and metabolic networks.

Availability: The plug-in and its user guide can be downloaded freely

1 INTRODUCTION

Nodes of biological networks often belong to multiple network
communities. Recently, a number of methods were published to
determine tightly or extensively overlapping network modules
(Adamcsek et (11., 2006; Ahn et (11., 2010; Fortunato, 2010;
Kovacs et (11., 2010; Mihalik and Csermely, 2011; Palla et (11.,
2005). Our ModuLand framework (Kovacs et (11., 2010) introduced
community landscapes. The x—y plane of a community landscape is
a conventional 2D visualization of the network, whereas the z-axis
represents community centrality. Community centrality of a given
edge (or node) was deﬁned as the sum of local inﬂuence zones of
all network edges (or nodes) including the given edge (or node;
Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus community centrality represents an
integrated measure of the whole network’s inﬂuence to one of
its edges or nodes. Hills of the community landscape correspond
to network modules (Supplementary Fig. S1) yielding extensive
overlaps. This concept led to the development of the ModuLand
family of network modularization methods (Kovacs et (11., 2010).

The widely used Cytoscape program (Shannon et (11., 2003) has
several very useﬁil Clustering plug-ins (Bader and Houge, 2003;
Morris et (11., 2011; thissorrakrai and Gunsalus, 2011; Rivera
et (11., 2010; Su et (11., 2010). However, these methods do not
focus on extensive modular overlaps, and do not build a modular
hierarchy, where meta-nodes of the higher level represent modules
of the lower level. Moreover, existing plug-ins do not provide
measures identifying the centre of the module, as well as key nodes
bridging two or multiple modules (see Supplementary Table S9,
and Supplementary Discussion). Here, we introduce the Cytoscape
plug-in of the most widely applicable version of the ModuLand
method family (Kovacs et (11., 2010). We demonstrate its ability to
determine biologically relevant, extensively overlapping network
modules, hierarchical layers of modules, module cores and key
inter-modular nodes using protein structure and metabolic networks.

2 SOFTWARE OVERVIEW

The ModuLand Cytoscape plug-in uses the LinkLand inﬂuence zone
determination method and the ProportionalHill module assignment
method of our formerly published ModuLand network module
determination method family (Kovacs et (11., 2010). These two
methods provide a good trade-off between the fast (but rather
inaccurate), and accurate (but rather slow) other ModuLand
methods.

The installation of the ModuLand plug-in follows Cytoscape
procedures. This is much easier than the setup required for the earlier
version (Kovacs et (11., 2010). The program can be distributed as
a single .jar ﬁle. Moreover, the current implementation works on
Linux, Windows and Mac OS, thereby extending the options of the
former version.

The plug-in determines extensively overlapping modules using
any undirected network type and weight description of Cytoscape.
Moreover, the plug-in calculates a set of hierarchical modules. In
the modular hierarchy, modules of the lower level become meta-
nodes of the upper level, and modular overlaps of the lower level
become weights of the meta-edges at the upper level. The plug-in
creates, automatically re-loads and visualizes the higher and higher
level hierarchies (with lower and lower number of meta-nodes and
meta-edges, see Fig. 1), until the whole network coalesces into a
single meta-node.

Fig. 1. The hierarchical modular structure determined by the ModuLand Cytoscape plug-in. The left side shows the protein structure network of E.coli
Met-tRNA synthase and its three hierarchical levels as determined by the plug-in. Each meta-node of a higher hierarchical level represents a module of the
level right below. All networks are coloured according to the ﬁve modules identiﬁed on hierarchical level 1. This colouring option can be performed by the

two clicks of the plug-in main dialog box shown on the right

The lower number of modules at higher hierarchical levels may
be Visualized either using the meta-nodes of the higher hierarchical
level itself, or projecting this higher level modular structure to the
nodes of the original network. On any level of module hierarchy,
nodes or meta-nodes can be Visualized assigning them the colour of
the module they mostly belong to. This shows a non-overlapping
assignment of nodes to modules. Nodes can also be marked by
blending the colours of the modules proportional to the overlapping
module assignment of the given node. Edges may be optionally
Visualized as a mix of the colour of their two nodes. The plug-
in sets meta-node labels on the higher hierarchical level based
on the modules of one level below in the hierarchy. The meta-
node on the higher hierarchical level representing the module has
the name of the node having the highest modular assignment
value for the corresponding module at one level below in the
hierarchy.

Node colours can also Visualize several node (or meta-
node) measures including weighted degree, betweenness centrality,
community centrality, overlap and bridgeness (see Supplementary
Fig. 2).

The plug-in has an option to merge highly similar module pairs
containing roughly the same nodes or meta-nodes with the same
intensity. For merging of modules the plug-in offers a correlation
histogram, and allows the user to select an appropriate correlation
threshold. The runtime complexity of the plug-in version remained
~0(n3), as deﬁned earlier (Kovacs et (11., 2010). To enhance the

performance of the plug-in for calculating the higher hierarchical
layers further, we introduced a user-selected optimization. This
results in the disappearance of meta-edges with very small weights
at the higher hierarchical levels. These low intensity meta-edges are
derived from the minor overlaps of distant modules of the lower
level. This optimization allowed a speedup in running time by a
factor of 7 for larger networks (Supplementary Table 510).

The plug-in is capable to generate overview reports for each
hierarchical level. These reports list the number of the nodes (meta-
nodes), edges (meta-edges) and modules, the effective number of
modules (see Kovacs et (11., 2010) and the size of each module.
The overview also contains the list of the 10 nodes of each module
having maximal module assignment value to the respective module
(called as the module core). Data related to the module assignment
and the calculated measures of nodes (and meta-nodes of higher
hierarchical levels) can be exported in a csv or txt format.

The plug-in contains a Help ﬁinction, and a detailed step-by-step
User Guide can also be downloaded from the plug-in webpage:

3 RESULTS AND CONCLUSION

ModuLand-derived communities of various yeast protein—protein
interaction networks gave a ﬁinctionally meaningful description of
the yeast interactome (Kovacs et (11., 2010). Function of module core
proteins proved to be good indicator of the function of the whole

module (Mihalik and Csermely, 2011). Here, we demonstrate the
use of the ModuLand Cytoscape plug-in on the protein structure
network of Escherichia coli Met-tRNA synthase, since an elegant
study (Ghosh and Vishveshwara, 2007) showed the existence of
four alternative communication paths in this enzyme. The ﬁve major
sub-domains of Met-tRNA synthase were well reﬂected by the ﬁve
modules obtained at the second hierarchical level of the protein
structure network (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table S3). Key amino
acids of the most frequently used communication path (Ghosh
and Vishveshwara, 2007) either belonged to the module cores
of the three modules involved in transmission of conformational
changes, or were inter-modular nodes between these modules (see
Supplementary Table S4). These observations were in agreement
with earlier ﬁndings (Ghosh and Vishveshwara, 2008; Sethi et a1.,
2009).

We further demonstrated the use of the ModuLand plug-in by
comparing the modular structures of the metabolic networks of
the free-living bacterium E.c01i and the endosymbiont Buchnera
aphidicola (Pal et a1., 2006). E.c01i metabolic module cores
had a signiﬁcant overlap (Fisher’s exact test P=1.4>< 10_7; see
Supplementary Information for more details) with the modules
determined earlier by Guimera and Amaral (2005).

Both visual inspection (see Supplementary Figs S4—S7) and
numerical values (see Supplementary Table S7) suggested a more
differentiated modular structure of the E.c01i metabolic network
than that of B.aphidic01a. This ﬁnding is in agreement with earlier
ﬁndings (Kreimer et a1., 2008; Mihalik and Csermely, 2011; Parter
et a1., 2007; Samal et a1., 2011; Tamarnes et a1., 2007). The difference
in modular structure was not likely to be caused by the difference in
the size of the E. coli and B.aphidic01a networks (see Supplementary
Figs S8 and S9, and Supplementary Tables S7 and S8).

E.c01i module cores corresponded to signiﬁcantly less metabolic
functions than those of B.aphidic01a (0.53 versus 0.67 functions
per module core reactions, respectively; bootstrap method P:
0.0392). This difference remained even when we used an ensemble
of 1000 randomly selected sub-networks of the E.c01i metabolic
network having the same number of nodes or edges as found in the
smaller B.aphidic01a network (see Supplementary Material for more
details). Moreover, additional tests suggested that the large twin-
modules forming the centre of the B.aphidic01a network were not
responsible for the differences observed in the number of metabolic
functions (see Supplementary Material). These results indicated
that modules of the metabolic network of an organism from a
variable environment (E.c01i) are more specialized than metabolic
network modules of a symbiont having a constant environment
(B.aphidic01a). It is noteworthy that our result is in agreement
with earlier ﬁndings using non-overlapping modularization (Parter
et a1., 2007), which is a further indication that the module cores
of the plug-in capture well the biologically relevant function of
modules.

In conclusion, the ModuLand Cytoscape plug-in provides a user-
friendly and efﬁcient method to identify and visualize a hierarchy
of extensively overlapping modules, and determines key network
positions (like module cores and bridges). As shown by several
case studies, modules identiﬁed by the plug-in correspond to
biologically meaningful groups, module cores help the identiﬁcation
of biological functions and inter-modular nodes have a key role in
a variety of biological networks.

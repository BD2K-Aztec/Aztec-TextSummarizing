ABSTRACT

Context: Epigenome reader domains are rapidly emerging as a new
class of drug targets for a wide array of human diseases. To facilitate
study of structure—activity relationship and small-molecule ligand
design for these domains, we have created ChEpiMod. ChEpiMod
is a free knowledgebase of chemical modulators with documented
modulatory activity for epigenome reader domains.

Methods: ChEpiMod organizes information about chemical modula-
tors and their associated binding-affinity data, as well as available
structures of epigenome readers from the Protein Data Bank. The
data are gathered from the literature and patents. Entries are supple-
mented by annotation. The current version of ChEpiMod covers
six epigenome reader domain families (Bromodomain, PHD finger,
Chromodomain, MBT, PWWP and Tudor). The database can be
used to browse existing chemical modulators and bioactivity
data, as well as, all available structures of readers and their molecular
interactions. The database is updated weekly.

Availability: ChEpiMod is freely available at http://chepimod.org
Contact: ming-ming.zhou@mssm.edu

Supplementary information: Supplementary data is available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Epigenetic control of gene expression plays a fundamental role in
numerous biological processes including development, cell pro-
liferation and differentiation, and its dysregulation has been
linked to multiple disorders such as cancer, inﬂammation and
infection (Kouzarides, 2007). The evolutionarily conserved
modular domains that are embedded in transcription-associated
proteins and recognize post-translational modiﬁcations such as
lysine acetylation or methylation are called ‘Epigenome Readers’
ﬂap and Zhou, 2010). The desire to better understand and
modulate the molecular functions of these readers has encour-
aged the development of small-molecule compounds (or ‘chem-
ical modulators’) that serve as research tools and as potential
therapeutic agents for a wide array of human diseases
(Arrowsmith, et a]. 2012). The ever-increasing number of com-
pounds with documented modulatory activity against epigenome
readers has prompted us to develop ChEpiMod, a comprehen-
sive knowledgebase of structureeactivity relationship data for

these domains and their chemical modulators. The goal of
ChEpiMod is to organize, in a single place, all publicly available
and relevant research data to facilitate the structure-guided
development and use of epigenome reader modulators as tools
for chemical epigenomics research. General purpose bioactivity
databases such as ChEMBL (Gaulton et al., 2012) and PubChem
BioAssay (Wang et al., 2012) contain information about some
ligands for epigenome readers, but are far from comprehensive
for these domains and do not provide structural information on
proteineligand interactions. Additionally, ligands stored in these
general databases have their afﬁnities listed for proteins, rather
than domains. ChEpiMod overcomes these limitations by provid-
ing comprehensive coverage of epigenome reader bioactivities,
coupled with structural information and advanced analysis tools.

2 DATABASE CONTENT

ChEpiMod currently contains 130 682 compounds (2042 with
afﬁnity <10 uM) (Supplementary Fig. S1). A total of 133
target proteins are covered matching 224 different domains.
The database contains 132524 bioactivities for which 44% is
assigned to a defined domain (2375 with afﬁnity <10 uM).
More than 99% of the bioactivities that are assigned to identiﬁed
domains are reported for Bromodomains (Supplementary
Table S1). Structures collected in ChEpiMod correspond to
Bromodomain (44%), PHD finger (22%), Chromodomains
(12%), MBT (10%), PWWP (7%) and Tudor domains (5%)
(Supplementary Table S1). Ligand-interaction data derived
from these structures is also stored (Figs 1 and 2).

3 USER INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONALITY

Users can access ChEpiMod Via a web interface. Search results
are displayed in a table reporting compound, protein, domain,
structure and binding afﬁnity, which can be exported in various
formats (Fig. 1). Within the table, users can access summaries
about a speciﬁc compound, protein or domain. The ‘domain
summary’ page displays the total number of compounds, struc-
tures and bioactivities available for that domain. A first tab on
this page enables the user to browse compounds clustered based
on their structural similarity, allowing the chemical diversity of
all known ligands for a domain to be explored. A second tab
provides a comparative View of the molecular interactions of all
available compounds with the target domain. Interactions can be
displayed either for the complete domain sequence or for the
binding site residues alone (Fig. 2). The binding site level View
provides information on interaction types (hydrophobic,

row in the table contains one bioactivity. Default columns show the compound structure, target protein and domain, afﬁnity values and reference.
Compound summary (1) and domain summary (2) pages are accessible from here. A display button (3) can be used to select multiple protein structures,
align and visualize them. Selected bioactivities, compounds and structures can be downloaded in various formats (4). Buttons available under each PDB
code to access the structure in the PDB, to visualize the 3D protein structure, and to search for similar binding sites in other domain structures

BrDl sequence. Consensus binding site residues are colored in purple. (B) Consensus acetyl-lysine binding site for BRD4-BrD1 and contacts with
MS417. Each contact is represented by four types of interactions: hydrophobic (maroon), aromatic (orange), hydrogen bond (purple) and ionic (cyan)

aromatic, polar and ionic). These features are also mapped on
the structure for Visualization (Supplementary Fig. S2). The
‘compound summary’ page contains physicochemical properties,
number of targeted proteins, domains, bioactivities, and protein
structures for a compound. Afﬁnity values expressed in K,, Kd
and IC50 (uM) are mapped on phylogenetic trees which provide
a family wide View of the coverage and selectivity of a speciﬁc
chemical modulator. ChEpiMod provides several other function-
alities. For example, the binding site similarity search identiﬁes
domains that have similar binding sites, which might be useful
for discovering potential new interactions for existing modula-
tors (Klabunde, 2007) and to assess their selectivity.

4 DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING

ChEpiMod is organized around bioactivities between epigenome
readers and chemical modulators. Bioactivities from journals and
patents are manually extracted and supplemented by data from
the ChEMBL_l7 database (Gaulton et al., 2012). Afﬁnity values
expressed as binding constants K,, K, and IC50 are stored in units
of micromolar. Compounds are represented by their 2D struc-
tures. Targets are annotated according to the Uniprot database
(Consortium, 2013), and the recommended Uniprot name is used
for each target name. Other protein names and aliases are also
extracted and stored, providing the user the ability to search the
database by protein name synonyms. Domains are annotated
according to the PFAM database (Punta et al., 2012). Since
some targets have more than one domain of the same type the
domain number is specified for any bioactivity. When the target
domain is missing (e. g. in patents) no target domain is speciﬁed
and the bioactivity is reported for the protein. Each bioactivity is
linked to its original source by the Pubmed identiﬁer for journals,
and the patent identiﬁer for patents.

All crystallographic structures of domains are collected from
the PDB (Berman et al., 2003). For each downloaded structure a
binding site is deﬁned as all residues with at least one heavy atom
within 6A of any ligand heavy atom; and a ‘Consensus binding’
site for each domain is also deﬁned (cf. Supplementary Materials
for deﬁnition). Molecular interactions between ligands and each
residue of the consensus binding site are computed using the
Interaction Fingerprints program (Marcou and Rognan, 2007)
and grouped in four categories according to the interaction type
(hydrophobic, aromatic, polar and ionic).

5 CONCLUSION

ChEpiMod has been developed to facilitate structure-based ra-
tional design of new chemical modulators for epigenetic reader
domains. The molecular interaction data available in the know-
ledge-database can guide to further improve compound afﬁnity
and selectivity, as well as identify protein residues important for
ligand recognition.

infrastructure. This portable data management and analysis
system allows users to create analysis workﬂows using a variety
of open—source tools. There is also community—wide effort to
standardize MS—data formats and make data available. Andrew
Jones introduced the Proteomics Standards Initiative’s new quan—
titative data format, szuantML. Henning Hermjakob showed
how PRIDE and the ProteomeXchange consortium provide a
data repository with globally coordinated infrastructure.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR BIOINFORMATICIANS IN
PROTEOMICS RESEARCH

Our panel session discussed the current opportunities in compu—
tational proteomics. Many exciting technological developments
have been made in the past decade in the field of MS—based
proteomics, and many researchers are now interested in using
proteomics to answer questions in systems biology and medicine.
A consensus of the panelists is that this is an exciting time for
bioinformaticians to study proteomics data and contribute in this

area. To effectively integrate the community efforts, open—source
tools and well—organized platforms for such tools are essential.
The panel also emphasized the importance for bioinformaticians
to communicate effectively with chemists and biologists to de—
velop useful tools for proteomics research. Lastly, young com—
putational biologists would benefit from experiences in MS
laboratory and interactions with experimental scientists.

Additional Information

MS—SIG will be held at ISMB 2014 and aims to bring together
experts from the global research community to discuss current
progress and challenges in the field of MS—based proteomics and
computational biology. The meeting will contain three portions:
oral presentation, panel discussion and poster presentation; it
invites abstract submissions on a wide range of topics.

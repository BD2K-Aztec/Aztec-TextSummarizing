Abstract

Summary: Synthetic biology has become a widely used technology, and expanding applications in
research, education and industry require progress tracking for team—based DNA synthesis projects.
Although some vendors are beginning to supply multi—kilobase sequence—verified constructs, syn—
thesis workflows starting with short oligos remain important for cost savings and pedagogical
benefit. We developed BIOPARTSDB as an open source, extendable workflow management system
for synthetic biology projects with entry points for oligos and larger DNA constructs and ending

with sequence—verified clones.

Availability and Implementation: BIOPARTSDB is released under the MIT license and available for
download at https://github.com/baderzone/biopartsdb. Additional documentation and video tutor—
ials are available at https://github.com/baderzone/biopartsdb/wiki. An Amazon Web Services image

is available from the AWS Market Place (ami—a01d0708).

1 Introduction

Synthetic biology projects require software systems to organize,
track and verify the creation of parts encoded by DNA sequences,
with individual parts corresponding to genomic elements such as
promoters or coding domains. Part sizes can range from 100 nucleo-
tide regulatory elements to megabase chromosomes. Tasks include
organizing an experimental plan, tracking protocols, retaining qual-
ity control assessments, assessing performance and storing a verified
part in a repository.

Biological enthusiasts, such as DIY Bio (http://diybio.org), edu-
cational initiatives such as iGEM (https://www.igem.org), and new
synthetic biology courses such as Build-a-Genome (Cooper et (11.,
2012) all require workflow systems to match to DNA synthesis
protocols. Protocols depend on whether a DNA construct or part is
obtained by PCR amplification, restriction digest or direct synthesis,
and direct synthesis can involve different hierarchical assembly strat-
egies. Quality control procedures and parts storage, whether in a
vector or as DNA, can also depend on the synthetic route. While la-
boratory information management systems (LIMS) are available for

synthetic biology (Ham et (11., 2012), they focus primarily on syn-
thetic DNA inventory management rather than on the synthesis pro-
cess itself. We therefore designed BIOPARISDB as an open source,
modular tool for DNA synthesis workflow and parts registration,
providing a ready resource for research and education. Our permis-
sive license makes the software fully available for industrial and
commercial applications as well.

2 Results and discussion

2.1 Overall process and unit operations

Parts are constructed through a series of unit operations (Fig. 1).
Each operation has well-defined characteristics: (i) input reagents;
(ii) output products; (iii) status (e.g. pending, done); (iv) quality con-
trol metrics; and (v) a protocol for converting the input to output
and performing quality assessment (QA) and quality control (QC).
These must be fully specified at each step in the process, and a suc-
cessful QC, termed a ‘Pass’, is required for the products to advance
to the next step.

clones for sequencing and still take advantage of large sequencing
batches. Quality control values, ‘Pass’ for error—free clones, from ex—
pert or automated validation analysis (Lee et al., 2010) can be re—
ported through CSV files by an administrator.

2.11 Administration

The BIOPARTSDB system provides administrative module that are re—
sponsible for managing parts, oligo plates, vendors, lab materials
(strain, vectors), devices (PCR machines, gel boxes), sequencing
plates, protocols, users and groups.

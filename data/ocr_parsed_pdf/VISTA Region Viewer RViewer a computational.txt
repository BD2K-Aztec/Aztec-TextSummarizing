ABSTRACT

Summary: Current genome browsers are designed for linear
browsing of individual genomic regions, but the high-throughput
nature of experiments aiming to elucidate the genetic component of
human disease makes it very important to develop user-friendly tools
for comparing several genomic regions in parallel and prioritizing
them based on their functional content. We introduce VISTA Region
Viewer (RViewer), an interactive online tool that allows for efficient
screening and prioritization of regions of the human genome for
follow-up studies. The tool takes as input genetic variation data
from different biomedical studies, determines a number of various
functional parameters for both coding and non-coding sequences in
each region and allows for sorting and searching the results of the
analysis in multiple ways.

Availability and implementation: The tool is implemented as
a web application and is freely accessible on the Web at
http://rviewer.lbl.gov

1 INTRODUCTION

The recent technological advances have allowed researchers to
discover a wide range of variations on the scale of a complete
human genome (Redon et al., 2006). The role of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and genomic copy number variations
(CNVs) in human disease is becoming increasingly evident
(Abrahams and Geschwind, 2008; Barkovich et al., 2009; Bucan
et (11., 2009; Mefford et (11., 2009), but it is often difﬁcult to move
from associations to the identiﬁcation of causative variations.

The number of genes in CNVs may be large, and non-coding
regions may also contribute to the phenotype. On the other hand, the
identiﬁcation of ﬁinctional SNPs requires predicting what impact
a certain polymorphism might have on gene function. This is
relatively straightforward with sequence variants leading to amino
acid changes in protein coding regions, since these are more
likely to disrupt gene function. However, a clear result of genome
wide association studies (GWASs) is that ﬁinctional SNPs with
association to disease are as likely to be found in the non-coding

portion of the genome (Frazer et (11., 2009). Thus data obtained by
several types of studies require an informatics approach to organize
biological knowledge and prioritize genomic intervals for further
analysis.

The current, widely used genome browsers, such as UCSC
Browser (Fujita et al., 2011). Ensembl (Flicek et al., 2011) and
GBrowse (Donlin, 2009) use individual intervals on a reference
genome to display the tracks of functional elements such as genes
or RNA. Investigating genomic intervals obtained through CNV or
other experiments requires looking at each interval individually,
while comparison of functional features in multiple intervals can
bring new insights into genome studies.

We describe an interactive online genome analysis tool VISTA
RViewer, a new addition to the VISTA suite of tools for comparative
genomics (Frazer et al., 2004). RViewer is designed to accept
datasets produced by clinical geneticists [either CNVs identiﬁed
in copy number array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)
studies or genomic neighborhoods of SNPs of interest from
GWASs]. It calculates a set of important parameters for both coding
and non-coding regions, and provides investigators with capabilities
to compare the intervals and identify those that are likely to be
signiﬁcant in a particular study. This tool also links to mouse
phenotype and gene expression data, thus allowing for comparisons
and prioritization of signiﬁcant genes and non-coding regions across
a region.

RViewer presents several ﬁinctionalities not found in currently
available tools. First, multiple genomic intervals are displayed
simultaneously, allowing for quicker visual inspection. Second,
direct links to gene ontology, pathway and mouse phenotype
data allow for more rapid prioritization of genes and regions of
likely biological signiﬁcance. And third, the annotation of highly
conserved non-coding intervals brings an important component into
the analysis, and is likely to be useful for whole genome sequencing
studies. To our knowledge, software providing such functions is not
currently available.

the data using various tools, deposit the data for further analysis and
export the results. Currently, results of CNV studies and GWASs are
supported. Each experiment may include multiple regions visualized
in parallel and compared with each other. Given a region location
on the chromosome, RViewer integrates a variety of annotations and
presents the data in the browser (Fig. 1).

The upper panel of the interface includes general information
about each region; the lower panel displays detailed information
when one region is selected. Coding and non-coding SNPs within
each region are derived from the dbSNP database (Sherry et (11.,
2001). For coding non-synonymous SNPs, the PolyPhen (Ramensky
et (11., 2002) annotation is available. For each non-coding region,
the homotypic clusters of transcription binding sites (HCT) (Gotea
et (11., 2010) are provided, as well as the number and location
of experimentally veriﬁed enhancers from the VISTA Enhancer
browser (Visel et (11., 2007). The VISTA conservation icon represents
the alignments of the human and mouse genomes and gives access
to VISTA Point with a wide range of comparative genomics
information based on different pair-wise and multiple alignments
(Dubchak et (11., 2009). For any gene within a region, its Gene
Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et (11., 2000) terms, KEGG (Kanehisa
and Goto, 2000) pathway and mouse phenotype are provided
wherever available. Access to relevant databases, such as GenBank,
OMIM and the UCSC genome browser is also provided.

The tool is highly interactive. Information in each column can
be sorted and ﬁltered, providing ﬂexibility for users to compare
and analyze the data. Thus, a user can prioritize the regions based
on the number of the coding SNPs predicted deleterious, the
number of enhancers, conservation across different species, the GO
terms or KEGG pathways of the genes, etc. The total number of
SNPs predicted to be deleterious in an interval does not affect the
probability that a SNP in that interval is a true causative variant: this
requires experimental work to demonstrate. However, the presence
of several potentially deleterious SNPs on the same haplotype
suggests that that haplotype should be given priority consideration
as potentially causative.

The tool is implemented as a Java-based web application. The
technologies used include Google Web Toolkit, EXT library, Spring
Framework and MySQL database server.

In summary, the RViewer is an analytical platform for genomic
regions that allows for visualization, comparison and analysis of
large-scale genomic data from current biomedical research.

2.2 Case study

To demonstrate the ﬁinctionality of RViewer, we analyzed nine
de novo copy number variants identiﬁed by aCGH in patients
with infantile spasms (ISS), a form of epilepsy associated with
severe developmental outcome. Preliminary analysis suggested
involvement of at least two biological networks—ventral forebrain
development and synaptic function. The regions of CNVs (hng)
were uploaded into RViewer and analyzed (Fig. 1). Based on the
annotations provided by RViewer, 23 genes with brain expression
patterns and GO terms similar to known ISS-associated genes were
identiﬁed. This allowed for identiﬁcation of the best candidates
for follow-up conﬁrmatory studies much faster than would have
been possible using currently available tools. Annotation of non-
coding intervals also identiﬁed highly conserved regions of possible
biological signiﬁcance for further study.

3 DISCUSSION

The high-throughput nature of modern genomic experiments makes
the availability of efﬁcient analytical tools critical. The presented
novel software RViewer has been utilized in several biomedical
test cases, and showed signiﬁcant improvement in the speed and
quality of analysis allowing for fast retrieval and visualization of
relevant biological information. The tool is designed in a modular
way allowing for customization and expansion such as taking results
of other genomic experiments (for example resequencing, whole
exome and genome sequencing), adding annotations relevant to a
particular disease, analyzing novel variant data and introducing new
complex searches. This work is currently in progress.

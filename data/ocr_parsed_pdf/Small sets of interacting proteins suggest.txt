ABSTRACT

Motivation: Proteins and protein complexes coordinate their activity
to execute cellular functions. In a number of experimental settings,
including synthetic genetic arrays, genetic perturbations and RNAi
screens, scientists identify a small set of protein interactions of
interest. A working hypothesis is often that these interactions are
the observable phenotypes of some functional process, which is
not directly observable. Confirmatory analysis requires finding other
pairs of proteins whose interaction may be additional phenotypical
evidence about the same functional process. Extant methods for
finding additional protein interactions rely heavily on the information
in the newly identified set of interactions. For instance, these
methods leverage the attributes of the individual proteins directly, in a
supervised setting, in order to find relevant protein pairs. A small set
of protein interactions provides a small sample to train parameters
of prediction methods, thus leading to low confidence.

Results: We develop RBSets, a computational approach to ranking
protein interactions rooted in analogical reasoning; that is, the ability
to learn and generalize relations between objects. Our approach is
tailored to situations where the training set of protein interactions is
small, and leverages the attributes of the individual proteins indirectly,
in a Bayesian ranking setting that is perhaps closest to propensity
scoring in mathematical psychology. We find that RBSets leads
to good performance in identifying additional interactions starting
from a small evidence set of interacting proteins, for which an
underlying biological logic in terms of functional processes and
signaling pathways can be established with some confidence. Our
approach is scalable and can be applied to large databases with
minimal computational overhead. Our results suggest that analogical
reasoning within a Bayesian ranking problem is a promising new
approach for real-time biological discovery.

1 INTRODUCTION

Functional mechanisms in the cell involve cascades of interactions
among gene products, mostly proteins and small molecules. In
recent years, a number of large-scale efforts have collected and
organized data produced by the community in publicly available,
online databases. Human curators summarize the current state of
our understanding of the cell’s functional landscape, for instance,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

by categorizing genes’ and proteins’ functional roles, distinguishing
those that have been experimentally veriﬁed from those that are most
probable using well established computational methods (Ashburner
et al., 2000; Firm et al., 2008; Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Letunic
et al., 2006; Mewes et al., 2004; Mulder et al., 2007; SGD).
However, the current understanding of signaling and regulation
dynamics that instantiate functions in the cell is far from complete.
Functional discovery is key. The main challenges are the scale of
the problem and the costs of the necessary experimental validation
(Evanko, 2009). The space of possible interactions and their multiple
functional roles is very large. Exploring it at random is inefﬁcient—
expensive and time consuming. A sensible approach is that of
prioritizing the experiments, testing the most probable functions and
interactions ﬁrst (Schwartz et al., 2008).

Methods routinely used by biologists today to assist biological
discovery boil down to assigning priority scores to protein—function
pairs and to protein—protein—function triples, individually or in small
sets. Here we consider a slightly different scenario, where we want
to assign priority scores to protein—protein pairs in the absence
of a clear functional implication. We propose a methodology to
rank protein—protein pairs that are most similar to a given small
set of protein—protein pairs of interest. We show that our approach,
based on analogical reasoning, is able to identify additional protein—
protein pairs that share functional implications with the set of pairs
of interest. These results suggest that our method may be useful in
establishing new functional implications, which are not necessarily
well annotated in existing databases.

Bayesian analogical reasoning, the ability to learn and generalize
relations between objects, seems particularly appropriate for
biological discovery because it does not estimate feature weights
and relations (during training) that are then ﬁxed in stone to produce
predictions. Rather, it calibrates a prior distribution on feature
weights that takes into account how features relate to one another,
but then updates these weights depending on the query, on the ﬂy.

To illustrate the practical beneﬁts of the proposed methodology,
consider the following scenario. A certain cellular process is poorly
understood and the corresponding gene ontology function is poorly
annotated, say, protein kinases. Consider extant protein interaction
prediction methods; they typically estimate the correlation structure
among features of all known proteins that is useﬁil to predict existing
interactions, e.g. with a Bayesian network (Myers et al., 2005),
store it on a web-server, and use it to rank interactions every time
users submit a set of protein interactions. However, if we were
to discover a few interactions with protein kinases and submit
them as a query, extant systems would not be able to rank other
interactions between kinases well, mainly for two reasons: (i) we

are submitting a small training set, and (ii) the correlations that
were estimated during the training phase did not include kinase
interactions, which were poorly annotated, and the corresponding
ranking mechanism (feature weights in a classiﬁer or conditional
probability tables in a Bayesian network) will have to rely on poor
estimates of the correlations. The proposed methodology on the other
hand, addresses the issue of small training sets (i) by regularizing
the estimates through the use of a prior distribution on the weights
in a Bayesian estimation setting. It gets around the issue of poor
annotations and poor parameters estimates during training (ii) by
updating the feature weights on the ﬂy using information in the
query set of interactions. In this example, our method would be able
to attribute more importance to features such as speciﬁc protein
domains, other features of the protein amino-acid sequences and
cellular localization in order to retrieve other kinase interactions
with high probability. The proposed method is also computationally
scalable to large databases.

In this article, we develop a statistical approach that
leverages relational learning: given a set of protein pairs S:
{A(1):B(1),A(2):B(2), ...,A(N):B(N)}, it measures how well other
pairs A:B ﬁt in with the set S. Our work addresses the question
of whether the relation between proteins A and B is analogous to
those relations found in S. Such questions are particularly relevant
in exploratory data analysis, where an investigator might want to
search for protein pairs that are analogous to pairs in the query set
of interest.

Our approach combines a similarity measure on function spaces
with Bayesian analysis to produce a ranking of pairs. It requires
data containing attributes of the proteins of interest and a link
matrix specifying existing relationships; no further attributes of such
relationships are necessary. We illustrate the potential of our method
on a collection of protein binding events and on metabolic pathways.
We show that our approach can work in practice even if a small
set of protein pairs is provided, when evaluated on two ﬁinctional
categorization systems: G0 and MIPS. Furthermore, we develop a
variational inference algorithm that scales to very-large databases.

Related problems and approaches: similarity-based methods
compute the score of a given protein pair as a ﬁinction of observable
attributes (e.g. corresponding genes’ expression levels) of the two
proteins under examination. Possibly multiple functions are then
assigned to each protein Pl- using a guilt-by-association principle,
e. g. by looking up in a curated database the most frequent functions
of the proteins Pj’s that interact with P1- with high scores (Butte
and Kohane, 2006; Clare and King, 2003; Margolin et al., 2006;
Markowetz et al., 2007). The main obstacle to the success of
these methods is that the similarity among proteins’ attributes is
informative about a shared ﬁinction only to a minor extent (Margoln
and Califano, 2007). Clustering-based methods compute the score
of a given protein pair as a function of topological properties
of the interactions. The interactome is divided into clusters, or
modules, and the inferred memberships of proteins-to-modules are
used as attributes to predict protein functions in a number of ways
(Adamcsek et al., 2006; Altaf—Ul-Amin et al., 2006; Bader and
Hougue, 2003; Enright et al., 2002; Sharan et al., 2005). Recent
results, however, suggest that a simple non-clustering method that
relies on the guilt-by-association principle is more accurate in
predicting proteins’ ﬁinctional roles (Song and Singh, 2009). The
curation of the interactome is noisy and its degree of inaccuracy is

higher than expected (Cusick et al., 2009). Proteins participate in
the execution of multiple functional processes (Airoldi et al., 2008).
These are perhaps two of the factors that can explain this surprising
result. Data integration methods compute the score of a given
protein pair as a ﬁinction that combines observed attributes, both of
individual proteins and of protein pairs, from multiple data sources.
These integrative methods have been the most successful to date in
predicting protein ﬁinction (Fraser and Marcotte, 2004; Guan et al.,
2008; Llewellyn and Eisenberg, 2008) and networks of functional
relationships between proteins (Hess et al., 2009; Huttenhower et al.,
2009; Ideker et al., 2002; Jansen et al., 2003; Jensen et al., 2009; Lee
et al., 2004; Myers et al., 2005; Troyanskaya et al., 2003; von Mering
et al., 2005) from large collections of data. The main drawback of
these approaches is that they often involve a hodgepodge of different
scores that only resemble P-values (Schervish, 1996; Sterne and
Smith, 2001). Multiple scores are usually combined using ad hoc
considerations that are speciﬁc to the data under examination. The
computational burden is substantial.

Our contribution: we introduce a new approach that determines
similarity between protein pairs by essentially computing similarity
between predictive functions that relate proteins pairs to functions.
Our methodology is based on the idea of analogical reasoning.

The proposed methodology departs from the existing approaches
in a few aspects. First, we explicitly address the ranking problem of
which pairs of proteins are most similar to an input set of protein
pairs. This is different from the typical protein pair prediction
problem addressed in the literature. While we rely on similarity
to rank protein pairs, we compute similarity between predictive
functions that map pairs of proteins to ﬁinctional links, rather than
between attributes of functionally related proteins. This will require
a description of the space where such functions live. Second, our
methodology focuses on the case where little evidence is available,
i.e. a small set of input pairs. This will require using prior functional
knowledge to calibrate a prior on the space of functions that places
mass on a most likely subspace of functions. Third, our methodology
is rooted in Bayesian statistical methodology. It captures and updates
prior knowledge about proteins’ functions stored in online databases
within a hierarchical Bayesian model. It can easily be integrated in
a computational pipeline for general use. Fourth, our variational
inference algorithm scales to very-large databases.

We consider two case studies where the underlying functional
implications of the interactions we consider correspond to physical
protein binding events and to signaling events within a metabolic
pathway. We quantify the extent to which small sets of interacting
proteins are suggestive of functional linkage mechanisms on the
collection of pathways in KEGG and of functions in MIPS.

2 METHODS

To deﬁne an analogy is to deﬁne a measure of similarity between structures
of related objects. In our setting. we need to measure the similarity between
pairs of objects. The key aspect that distinguishes our approach from others is
that we focus on the similarity between predictive functions that map pairs to
links. rather than focusing on the similarity between the attributes of objects
in a candidate pair and the features of objects in the query pairs.

As an illustration. consider an analogical reasoning question from a SAT-
like exam where for a given pair (say. water:river) we have to choose. out
of 5 pairs. the one that best matches the type of relation implicit in such a
‘query’. In this case. it is reasonable to say car:highway would be a better

match than (the somewhat nonsensical) soda:ocean. since cars ﬂow on a
highway. and so does water in a river. Notice that if we were to measure the
similarity between objects instead of relations. soda:ocean would be a much
closer pair. since soda is similar to water. and ocean is similar to river.

It is reasonable to infer relational similarity from individual object features
(Gentner and Medina. 1998). What is needed is a mechanism by which object
features should be weighted in a particular relational similarity problem. We
postulate that. in analogical reasoning. similarity between features of objects
is only meaningful to the extent to which such features are useful to predict
the existence of the relationships.

2.1 An illustrative example

As an intuitive illustration. consider university admission exams. like the
American Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and Graduate Record Exam
(GRE). These exams used to include a section on analogical reasoning.
A prototypical analogical reasoning question is shown in Figure 1. The
examinee has to answer which of the 5 pairs best matches the relation implicit
in DOCTOR: HOSPITAL. Although all candidate pairs interact in some way.
pair professor: college seems to best capture the notion of (object.
place of work) implicit in the relation between doctor and hospital.

Performing this type of analogical reasoning in an automated way may be
useful in less mundane domains. where it is hard to reason about relations
that have not yet been discovered. Consider the question shown in Figure 2.
composed solely of pairs of interacting proteins according to the MIPS
classiﬁcation system (Mewes et al.. 2004). In the given question. YDLO 61C
is a protein of type cytoplasm (category 40.03). while YLR167W is of type
cytoplasmic and nuclear degradation (category 6.13.01). Such is also the
case of B) YBLO92W : YKRO94C. Other pairs contain members which
are both in the 40.03 category but none in 6.13.01. and are in this sense
not as close to the question pair as option B. In a realistic situation where
the categorization system at hand contains a few annotation errors and a
large number of omissions. automated strategies for analogical reasoning
that leverage the current state of our knowledge about the proteins would
be useful.

Dividing the population of protein interactions into subpopulations with
similar mechanisms of linkage is therefore a way of categorizing proteins
and their functional roles. The population of interacting pairs of proteins
is not uniform. The biological mechanism by which protein pair P1:P2
is linked might not be the same mechanism behind the linkage of P3:P4.
as illustrated above. The result of this effort is that taxonomies such as
the Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al.. 2000). or the Munich Institute for
Protein Sequencing (MIPS) database (Mewes et al.. 2004) can be enriched
by suggesting analogical similarities of protein interactions.

2.2 Statistical background on analogical reasoning

Probabilities can be exploited as a measure of similarity. Let R be a binary
random variable representing whether an arbitrary data point X is ‘relevant’
for a given query set S (R: 1) or not (R20). Let P(- | -) be a generic
probability mass function or density function. with its meaning given by the
context. Points are ranked in decreasing order by the following criterion

P(R=1 ix, S) _P(R=1 |S)P(X | R21, S)
P(R=O ix, S) _P(R=O | S) P(X | R20, S)”

 

which is equivalent to ranking points by the expression
logP(X | R: 1, S)—logP(X | R20, S) (1)

The challenge is to deﬁne what form P(X | R = r, S) should assume. It is
not practical to collect labeled data in advance which. for every possible class
of queries. will give an estimate for P(R: 1 | X, S): in general. one cannot
anticipate which classes of queries will exist. Methods based on Bayesian
networks with known labels (e.g. Myers et al.. 2005). for instance. would
suffer in terms of recall. Instead. a variety of approaches has been developed
in the literature in order to deﬁne a suitable instantiation of (1). These include
a method that builds a classiﬁer on-the-ﬂy using S as elements of the positive
class R: 1. and a random subset of data points as the negative class R=O
(e.g. Turney. 2008).

In this setup. the event ‘R: 1’ is equated with the event that X and the
elements of S are i.i.d points generated by the same model. The event ‘R = 0’
is the event by which X and S are generated by two independent models: one
for X and another for S. The parameters of all models are random variables
that have been integrated out. with ﬁxed (and common) hyperparameters.
The result is the instantiation of (1) as

P(X , S)

P(X)P(S) ’ (2)

logP(X | S) — logP(X) = log
the Bayesian score function by which we rank points X given a query S. The
right-hand side was rearranged to provide a more intuitive graphical model.
From this graphical model interpretation we can see that the score function
is a Bayes factor comparing two models (Kass and Raftery. 1995).
Next. we describe how the Bayesian sets method can be adapted to deﬁne
analogical similarity in biological networks settings.

2.3 Bayesian analogical similarity for protein pairs

Let A and 8 represent object spaces. To say that an interaction A:B is
analogous to S={A(l):B(l),A(2):B(2), ...,A(N):B(N)} amounts to implicitly
deﬁning a measure of similarity between the pair A:B and the set of pairs S.
where each query item A(k):B(k) corresponds to some pair Ai:Bl. However.
this similarity is not directly derived from the similarity of the information
contained in the distribution of objects themselves. {Ai} CA. {Bi} C 8.
Rather. the similarity between A:B and the set S is deﬁned in terms of the
similarity of the functions mapping the pairs as being linked. Each possible
function captures a different possible relationship between the objects in
the pair.

Bayesian analogical reasoning: Consider a space of latent functions
in AXB—> {0,1}. Assume that A and B are two objects classiﬁed as
linked by some unknown function f(A,B). i.e.f(A,B)= 1. We want to
quantify how similar the function f (A,B) is to the function g(- , -). which
classiﬁes all pairs (Ai,Bi) e S as being linked. i.e. where g(Ai,Bl)= 1.
The similarity depends on the observations {S,A,B} and our prior
distribution overf(-, -) and g(-,-).

Functions f (-) and g(-) are unobserved. hence the need for a prior that will
be used to integrate over the function space. Our similarity metric will be
deﬁned using Bayes factors. as explained next.

Bayesian analogical reasoning identifies latent functional linkage mechanisms

 

2.3.] Scoring analogy of linkage functions using logistic regression
For simplicity. we will consider a family of latent functions that is
parameterized by a ﬁnite-dimensional vector: the logistic regression function
with multivariate Gaussian priors for its parameters.

For a particular pair (Ai e A. Bi 6 8). let Xif = [<1>1(Ai,B/') <1>2(Ai,B/')
 '<I>'K(Ai ,Bl)]T be a point on a feature space deﬁned by the mapping
<I>:.A><B—>fliK. This feature space mapping computes a K—dimensional
vector of attributes of the pair that may potentially be relevant to predicting
the relation between the objects in the pair. Let L” e{0,1} be an indicator
of the existence of a link or relation between Ai and Bi in the database. Let
®:[61,...,9K]T be the parameter vector for our logistic regression model
such that

P(Lif :1|Xij,®):logistic(®TXij), (3)
and logistic()r):(1+e_")_l is the standard mapping from Re [0, 1].

We now apply the same score function underlying the Bayesian
methodology explained in Section 2.2. However. instead of comparing
objects by marginalizing over the parameters of their feature distributions. we
compare functions for link indicators by marginalizing over the parameters
of the functions.

Let LS be the vector of link indicators for S: in fact each L 6 LS has the
value L : 1. indicating that every pair of objects in S is linked. Consider the
following Bayes factor:

P(LU=1,LS=1|XU,S)
P(L’l:1|X’7)P(LS :1 | S)

This is an adaptation of Equation (2) where relevance is deﬁned now by
whether L” and LS were generated by the same model. for ﬁxed {X’l ,S}. In
one sense. this is a discriminative Bayesian sets model. where we predict
links instead of modeling joint object features. Since we are integrating out
8. a prior for this parameter vector is needed.

Thus. each pair (Ai,Bi) is evaluated with respect to a query set S by the
score function given in (4). rewritten after taking a logarithm and dropping
constants as:

(4)

.score(Ai,Bi) = logP(L’l =1 |Xif,S,LS = 1)

— logP(Lijzl |X’7) (5)

The exact details of our procedure are as follows. We are given a relational
database (DA,DB,£AB). Dataset DA (D3) is a sample of objects of type
A (8). Relationship table ﬁAB is a binary matrix modeled as generated from
a logistic regression model of link existence. A query proceeds according to
the following steps:

(i) the user selects a set of pairs S that are linked in the database. where
the pairs in S are assumed to have some relation of interest;

(ii) perform Bayesian inference to obtain the corresponding posterior
distribution for 8. P(®|S,LS). given a Gaussian prior P(Q); and

(iii) iterate through all linked pairs. computing the following for each pair:
P(L’7 :1|XU,S,LS =1)=/1D(Lif=1|XU,o)1D(o|S,LS =1)d®,

where P(L’l : 1|X’7) is similarly computed by integrating over P(G). All pairs
are presented in decreasing order according to the score in Equation (5).
The integral presented above does not have a closed formula. Because
computing the integrals by a Monte Carlo method for a large number of
pairs would be unreasonable. we use a variational approximation (Airoldi.
2007; Jordan et al.. 1999). Figure 3 presents a summary of the approach.
The suggested setup scales as 0(K3) with the feature space dimension.
due to the matrix inversions necessary for (variational) Bayesian logistic
regression (Jaakkola and Jordan. 2000). A less precise approximation to
P(®|S, LS) can be imposed if the dimensionality of 8 is too high. However.
it is important to point out that once the initial integral P(® | S,LS) is
approximated. each score function can be computed at a cost of 0(K2).
Our analogical reasoning formulation is a relational model in that it models
the presence and absence of interactions between objects. By conditioning
on the link indicators. the similarity score between A:B and C :D is always

a function of pairs (A,B) and (C ,D) that is not in general decomposable as
similarities between A and C . and B and D.

2.3.2 Empirical priors and calibration using biological databases The
choice of prior is based on the observed data. in a way that is equivalent
to the choice of priors used in the original formulation of Bayesian sets
(Ghahramani and Heller. 2005). Let 6 be the maximum-likelihood estimator
(MLE) of 8 using the relational database (DA,DB,£AB). Since the number
of possible pairs grows at a quadratic rate with the number of objects. we do
not use the whole database for MLE. Instead. to get 6 we use all linked pairs
as members of the ‘positive’ class (L: 1). and subsample unlinked pairs as
members of the ‘negative’ class (L:0). We subsample by sampling each
object uniformly at random from the respective datasets DA and D3 to get
a new pair. Since link matrices ﬁAB are usually very sparse. in practice this
will almost always provide an unlinked pair. Section 3 provides more details.

We use the prior P(G):N(©,(cT)_l). where N(m,V) is a normal of
mean m and variance V. Matrix T is the empirical second moments matrix of
the linked object features. although a different choice might be adequate for
different applications. Constant c is a smoothing parameter set by the user. In
all of our experiments. we set c to be equal to the number of positive pairs.
A good choice of c might be important to obtain maximum performance.
but we leave this issue as future work. (Wang et al.. 2009) present some
sensitivity analysis results.

Empirical priors are a sensible choice. since this is a retrieval. not a
predictive. task. Basically. the entire dataset is the population. from which
prior information is obtained on possible query sets. A data-dependent prior
based on the population is important for an approach such as Bayesian
sets. since deviances from the ‘average’ behavior in the data are useful to
discriminate between subpopulations.

2.3.3 Extensions to continuous/multivariate relations Although here we
focused on measuring similarity of qualitative relationships. the same idea
could be extended to continuous (or ordinal) measures of relationship. or
relationships where each Lil is a vector. Several similarity metrics can be
deﬁned on this vector of continuous relationships. Given data on protein
attributes. one can easily modify our approach by substituting the logistic
regression component with some multiple regression model.

The budding yeast is a unicellular organism that has become a
de-facto model organism for the study of molecular and cellular
biology (Botstein et al., 1997). There are about 6000 proteins in

the budding yeast, which interact in a number of ways (Cherry
et al., 1997). For instance, proteins bind together to form protein
complexes, the physical units that carry out most functions in the
cell (Krogan et al., 2006). In recent years, signiﬁcant resources have
been directed to collect experimental evidence of physical proteins
binding, in an effort to infer and catalogue protein complexes and
their multifaceted ﬁinctional roles (Fields and Song, 1989; Ho et al.,
2002; Ito et al., 2000; Uetz et al., 2000). Currently, there are four
main sources of interactions between pairs of proteins that target
proteins localized in different cellular compartments with variable
degrees of success: (i) literature curated interactions (Reguly et al.,
2006); (ii) yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) interaction assays (Yu et al.,
2008); (iii) protein fragment complementation (PCA) interaction
assays (Tarassov et al., 2008); and (iv) tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation
(TAP) interaction assays (Gavin et al., 2006; Krogan et al., 2006).
These collections include a total of about 12 292 protein interactions
(Jensen and Bork, 2008), although the number of such interactions
is estimated to be between 18 000 (Yu et al., 2008) and 30000 (von
Mering et al., 2002).

3.1 Design of experiments

We consider multiple ﬁinctional categorization systems for the
proteins in budding yeast. For evaluation purposes, we use individual
proteins’ ﬁinctional annotations curated by the Munich Institute for
Protein Sequencing (MIPS) (Mewes et al., 2004), those by the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa
and Goto, 2000), and those by the Gene Ontology consortium
(GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000). We consider multiple collections
of physical protein interactions that encode alternative semantics.
Physical protein interactions in the MIPS curated collection measure
physical binding events observed experimentally in Y2H and TAP
experiments, whereas physical protein-to-protein interactions in the
KEGG curated collection measure a number of different modes
of interactions, including phosporelation, methylation and physical
binding, all taking place in the context of a speciﬁc signaling
pathway. So we have three possible functional annotation databases
(MIPS, KEGG and GO) and two possible link matrices (MIPS and
KEGG), which can be combined.

Our experimental pipeline is as follows. (i) Pick a database of
ﬁinctional annotations, say MIPS, and a collection of interactions,
say MIPS (again). (ii) Pick a pair of categories, M1 and M2. For
instance, take M1 to be cytoplasm (MIPS 40.03) and M2 to be
cytoplasmic and nuclear degradation (MIPS 06.13.01). (iii) Sample,
uniformly at random and without replacement, a set S of 15
interactions in the chosen collection. (iv) Rank other interacting
pairsl according to the score in Equation (5) and, for comparison
purposes, according to three other approaches to be described in
Section 3.1.4. (v) The process is repeated for a large number of pairs
M1 XM2, and 5 different query sets S are generated for each pair of
categories. (vi) Calculate an evaluation metric for each query and
each of the four scores. Report a comparative summary of results.

3.1.] Protein speciﬁc features The protein speciﬁc features were
generated using the datasets summarized in Table 1 and an additional
dataset (Qi et al., 2006), from which 20 gene expression attributes
were obtained. Each gene expression attribute for a protein pair P1- :P1.

 

1The portion of ranked list that is relevant for evaluation purposes is limited
to a subset of the proteiniprotein interactionsisee Section 3.1.3.

corresponds the correlation coefﬁcient between the expression levels
of corresponding genes. The 20 different attributes are obtained from
20 different experimental conditions as measured by microarrays.
We did not use pairs of proteins from Qi et al. (2006) for which
we did not have data in the datasets listed in Table 1. This resulted
in approximately 6000 positively linked data points for the MIPS
network and 39 000 for KEGG. We generated another 25 protein—
protein gene expression features from the data in Table 1 using
the same procedure based on correlation coefﬁcients. This gives
a total of 45 attributes, corresponding to the main dataset used in
our relational Bayesian sets runs. Another dataset was generated
using the remaining (i.e. non-microarray) features of Table 1. Such
features are binary and highly sparse, with most entries being 0 for
the majority of linked pairs. We removed attributes for which we
had fewer than 20 linked pairs with positive values according to the
MIPS network. The total number of extra binary attributes was 16.
Several measurements were missing. We imputed missing values for
each variable in a particular datapoint by using its empirical average
among the observed values.

Given the 45 or 61 attributes of a given pair {Pl-, Pj }, we applied
a non-linear transformation where we normalize the vector by its
Euclidean norm in order to obtain our feature table X.

3.1.2 Calibrating the prior for 8 We ﬁt a logistic regression
classiﬁer using a MLE and our data, obtaining the estimate  Our
choice of covariance matrix D for O is deﬁned to be a rescaling of
a squared norm of the data:

(3‘1 =X1E05Xpos, (6)

where X1205 is the matrix containing the protein—protein features
only of the linked pairs used in the MLE computation.

3.1.3 Evaluation metrics We propose an objective measure of
evaluation that is used to compare different algorithms. Consider
a query set S, and a ranked response list R:{R1,R2,R3, ..., RN}
of protein—protein pairs. Every element of S is a pair of proteins
Pisz such that P;- is of class M1- and Pj is of class Mj, where M;-
and Mj are classes from either MIPS, KEGG or Gene Ontology. In
general, proteins belong to multiple classes. The retrieval algorithm
that generates R does not receive any information concerning the
MIPS, KEGG or G0 taxonomy. R starts with the linked protein pair
that is judged most similar to S, followed by the other protein pairs
in the population, in decreasing order of similarity. Each algorithm
has its own measure of similarity.

The evaluation criterion for each algorithm is as follows: as
before, we generate a precision-recall curve and calculate the area
under the curve (AUC). We also calculate the proportion (TOP10),

among the top 10 elements in each ranking, of pairs that match the
original {M1,M2} selection (i.e. a ‘correct’ Pisz is one where P;-
is of class M1 and Pj of class M2, or vice-versa. Notice that each
protein belongs to multiple classes, so both conditions might be
satisﬁed.) Since a researcher is only likely to look at the top ranked
pairs, it makes sense to deﬁne a measure that uses only a subset of
the ranking. AUC and TOP10 are our two evaluation measures.

The original classes {M 1 ,M2} are known to the experimenter but
not known to the algorithms. Our criterion is rather stringent, in
the sense it requires a perfect match of each R1 with the MIPS,
KEGG or G0 categorization. There are several ways by which
a pair RI might be analogous to the relation implicit in S, and
they do not need to agree with MIPS, GO or KEGG. Still, if we
are willing to believe that these standard categorization systems
capture functional organization of proteins at some level, this must
lead to association between categories given to S and relevant sub-
populations of protein—protein interactions similar to S. Therefore,
the corresponding AUC and TOP10 are useﬁil tools for comparing
different algorithms even if the actual measures are likely to be
pessimistic for a ﬁxed algorithm.

3.1.4 Competing algorithms We compare our method against a
variant of it and two similarity metrics widely used for information
retrieval: (i) the cosine score (Manning et al., 2008), denoted by
COS; (ii) the nearest neighbor score, denoted by NNS; (iii) the
relational maximum-likelihood sets score, denoted by MLS. The
nearest neighbor score measures the minimum Euclidean distance
between R1 and any individual point in S, for a given query set S
and a given candidate point RI . The relational MLS is a variation
of RBSETS where we initially sample a subset of the unlinked
pairs (10000 points in our setup) and, for each query S, we ﬁt a
logistic regression model to obtain the parameter estimate @MLE.
We also use a logistic regression model ﬁt to the whole dataset
(the same one used to generate the prior for RBSETS), giving
the estimate @MLE. A new score, analogous to (5), is given by
logP(Lij = 1|X17,og4LE)—iogP(Lif =1|Xif,oMLE), i.e. we do not
integrate out the parameters or use a prior, but instead the models
are ﬁxed at their respective estimates.

Neither COS or NNS can be interpreted as measures of analogical
similarity, in the sense that they do not take into account how the
protein pair features X contribute to their interactionz.

3.2 Analysis of physical interactions (MIPS)

For this batch of experiments, we use the MIPS network of
protein—protein interactions to deﬁne the relationships. In the initial
experiment, we selected queries from all combinations of MIPS
classes for which there were at least 50 linked pairs Pisz in the
network that satisﬁed the choice of classes. Each query set contained
15 pairs. After removing the MIPS-categorized proteins for which
we had no feature data, we ended up with a total of 6125 proteins
and 7788 positive interactions. We set the prior for RBSETS using a
sample of 225 842 pairs labeled as having no interaction, as selected
by (Qi et al., 2006).

 

2As a consequence. none uses negative data. Another consequence is the
necessity of modeling the input space that generates X. a difﬁcult task given
the dimensionality and the continuous nature of the features.

classes using the MIPS proteiniprotein interaction network

The ﬁrst two columns, #AUC and #TOPlO, count the number of times the respective
method obtains the best score according to the AUC and TOP10 measures, respectively,
among the 4 approaches. This is divided by the number of replications of each query
type (5). The last two columns, #AUC.S and #TOP10.S are ‘smoothed’ versions of this
statistic: a method is declared the winner of a round of 5 replications if it obtains the
best score in at least 3 out of the 5 replications. The top table shows the results when
only the continuous variables are used by RBSETS, and in the bottom table when the
discrete variables are also given to RBSETS.

For each tentative query set S of categories {M 1 ,Mg}, we scored
and ranked pairs PlizPJ’. such that both Pl’. and PJ’. were connected to
some protein appearing in S by a path of no more than two steps,
according to the MIPS network. The reasons for the ﬁltering are
2-fold: to increase the computational performance of the ranking
since fewer pairs are scored; and to minimize the chance that
undesirable pairs would appear in the top 10 ranked pairs. Tentative
queries would not be performed if after ﬁltering we obtained fewer
than 50 possible correct matches. Trivial queries, where ﬁltering
resulted only in pairs in the same class as the query, were also
discarded. The resulting number of unique pairs of categories
{M 1 ,M2} was 931 classes of interactions. For each pair of categories,
we sampled our query set S 5 times, generating a total of 4655
rankings per algorithm.

We run two types of experiments. In one version, we give to
RBSETS the data containing only the 45 (continuous) microarray
measurements. In the second variation, we provide to RBSETS all
61 variables, including the 16 sparse binary indicators. However,
we noticed that the addition of the 16 binary variables hurts
RBSETS considerably. We conjecture that one reason might be the
degradation of the variational approximation. Including the binary
variables hardly changed the other three methods, so we choose to
use the 61 variable dataset for the other methods.

Table 2 summarizes the results of this experiment. We show the
number of times each method wins according to both the AUC and
TOP10 criteria. The number of wins is presented as divided by 5,
the number of random sets generated for each query type {M 1 ,Mg}
(notice these numbers do not need to add up to 931, since ties are
possible). Moreover, we also presented ‘smoothed’ versions of this
statistic, where we count a method as the winner for any given
{M 1 ,M2} category if, for the group of 5 queries, the method obtains
the best result in at least 3 of the sets. The motivation is to smooth
out the extra variability added by the particular set of 15 protein pairs
for a ﬁxed {M 1 ,MZ}. The proposed relational Bayesian sets method
is the clear winner according to all measures when we select only

the continuous variables. For this reason, for the rest of this section
all analysis and experiments will consider only this case. Table 3
displays a pairwise comparison of the methods. In this Table, we
show how often the row method performs better than the column
method, among those trials where there was no tie. Again, RBSETS
dominates.

Another useﬁil summary is the distribution of correct hits in the
top 10 ranked elements across queries. This provides a measure of
the difﬁculty of the problem, besides the relative performance of
each algorithm. In Table 4, we show the proportion of correct hits
among the top 10 for each algorithm for our queries using MIPS
categorization and also GO categorization, as explained in the next
section. About 14% of the time, all pairs in the top 10 pairs ranked
by RB SETS were of the intended type, compared to 8% of the second
best approach.

3.2.1 Changing the categorization system A variation of this
experiment was performed where the protein categorizations do
not come from the same family as the link network, i.e. where we
used the MIPS network but not the MIPS categorization. Instead we
performed queries according to Gene Ontology categories. Starting
from 150 pre-selected GO categories (Myers et al., 2006), we once

again generated unordered category pairs {M 1 ,MZ}. A total of 179
queries, with 5 replications each (a total of 895 rankings), were
generated and the results summarized in Table 5.

This is a more challenging scenario for our approach, which is
optimized with respect to MIPS. Still, we are able to outperform
other approaches. Differences are smaller, but consistent. In the
pairwise comparison of RBSETS against the second best method,
COS, our method wins 62% of the time by the TOP10 criterion.

3.2.2 The role of ﬁltering In both experiments with the MIPS
network, we ﬁltered candidates by examining only a subset of the
proteins linked to the elements in the query set by a path of no more
than two proteins. It is relevant to evaluate how much coverage
of each category pair {M1,M2} we obtain by this neighborhood
selection.

For each query S, we calculate the proportion of pairs Pisz of
the same categorization {M1,M2} such that both P;- and Pj are
included in the neighborhood. For the MIPS categorization, 93%
of the queries resulted in a coverage of at least 75% (with 24% of
the queries resulting in perfect coverage). Although ﬁltering implies
that some valid pairs will never be ranked, the gain obtained by
reducing false positives in the top 10 ranked pairs is considerable
(results not shown) across all methods, and the computational gain
of reducing the search space is particularly relevant in exploratory
data analysis.

3.3 Analysis of signaling pathways (KEGG)

We repeated the same experimental setup, now using the KEGG
network to deﬁne the protein interactions. We selected proteins from

the KEGG categorization system for which we had data available.
A total of 6125 proteins was selected. The KEGG network is much
more dense than MIPS. A total of 38 961 positive pairs and 226 188
negative links were used to generate our empirical prior.

Since the KEGG network is much more dense than MIPS, we
ﬁltered our candidate pairs by allowing only proteins that are directly
linked to the proteins in the query set S. Even under this restriction,
we are able to obtain high coverage: the neighborhood of 90% of the
queries included all valid pairs of the same category, and essentially
all queries included at least 75% of the pairs falling in the same
category as the query set. A total of 1523 possible category pairs
(7615 queries, considering 5 replications) were generated.

Results are summarized in Table 6. Again, it is evident that
RBSETS dominates other methods. In the pairwise comparison
against COS, RB SETS wins 76% of the times according to the TOP10
criterion. However, the ranking problem in the KEGG network was
much harder than in the MIPS network (according to our automated
non-analogical criterion). We believe that the reason is that, in
KEGG, the simple ﬁltering scheme has much less inﬂuence, as
reﬂected by the high coverage. The distribution of the number of
hits in the top 10 ranked items is shown in Table 7. Despite the
success of RB SETS relative to the other algorithms, there is room for
improvement.

4 CONCLUDING REMARKS

We presented a novel measure of similarity between biological
structures based on the principle of analogical comparison.
It provides a way of clustering biological data that is considerably
different from other methods, due to its focus on analysing the space
of functions that map object features to their relations, instead of
the feature space itself. For small size queries, our method ﬁnds

analogies that are functionally relevant among the top matches. We
evaluated our approach with thousands of experiments.

This work can be expanded in many ways, including but not
limited to: allowing for extra dependencies between interactions that
are not due to input features X, scaling up the algorithm to allow for
higher-dimensional data, and applying it to other domains such as
evaluating analogies between cells from different species. Filtering
could also be improved by using criteria other than path lengths
in a interaction network. It is also of interest to apply substantive
background knowledge in evaluating rankings that take into account
the actual analogical similarity of different pairs. We believe several
useﬁil variations of our approach can be designed in the future.

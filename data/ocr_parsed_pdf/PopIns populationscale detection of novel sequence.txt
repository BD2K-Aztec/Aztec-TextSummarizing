Abstract

Motivation: The detection of genomic structural variation (SV) has advanced tremendously in
recent years due to progress in high—throughput sequencing technologies. Novel sequence inser—
tions, insertions without similarity to a human reference genome, have received less attention than
other types of SVs due to the computational challenges in their detection from short read sequenc—
ing data, which inherently involves de novo assembly. De novo assembly is not only computation—
ally challenging, but also requires high—quality data. Although the reads from a single individual
may not always meet this requirement, using reads from multiple individuals can increase power
to detect novel insertions.

Results: We have developed the program Poplns, which can discover and characterize non—
reference insertions of 100 bp or longer on a population scale. In this article, we describe the
approach we implemented in Poplns. It takes as input a reads—to—reference alignment, assembles
unaligned reads using a standard assembly tool, merges the contigs of different individuals into
high—confidence sequences, anchors the merged sequences into the reference genome, and finally
genotypes all individuals for the discovered insertions. Our tests on simulated data indicate that
the merging step greatly improves the quality and reliability of predicted insertions and that Poplns
shows significantly better recall and precision than the recent tool Il/IindTheGap. Preliminary
results on a dataset of 305 Icelanders demonstrate the practicality ofthe new approach.

The latest version of the human reference genome (International
Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2001; Venter et (11.,
2001), GRCh38, is of a remarkable quality. However, the sequence
of a single individual is inherently different from the reference due
to sequence diversity. Some sequences are missing in the reference as
they are not present in the individuals from whom the reference was
constructed. Alternate haplotypes have been added to the reference
genome (Horton et (11., 2008) to account for highly variable regions,

quence diversity is known to affect phenotypes including numerous
diseases (Conrad et (11., 2010; Stankiewicz and Lupski, 2010). Thus,
the characterization of differences to the reference genome is a
major task.

Differences between human genomes include single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), small indels and structural variants (SVs).

are insertions. Insertions can be further classified into duplications
and novel sequence insertions. Duplications are insertions of se—
quence also present elsewhere in the genome, e. g. mobile elements.
The focus of this work is on novel sequence insertions, insertions of
unique sequence that is not similar to other regions of the reference
genome. The evolutionary origin of a novel sequence insertion may
be explained by two types of events. On the one hand, it may be an
addition of sequence to the genome of a sequenced individual, e. g.
lateral transfer or viral genome insertion. On the other hand, it may
as well be a deletion of sequence in the individuals used to contruct
the reference.

In order to successfully associate genetic differences with pheno—
types, large numbers of individuals are necessary. With the enor—
mous improvements in sequencing technology, recent years have
seen a marked increase in large—scale efforts that aim at discovering
variation at a population level, e.g. the HapMap project (Gibbs et
al., 2003), the 1000 genomes projects (1000 Genomes Project
Consortium, 2010, 2012) and the Genome of the Netherlands pro—
ject (Boomsma et al., 2014). The achievements of these efforts have
been the characterization of a great number of SNPs, indels, and de—
letions, but comparatively fewer novel insertions. For example,
Mills et al. (2011) reported only 128 novel insertions in contrast to
22 025 deletions in their release set.

One reason for a smaller number of insertions discovered is the
fact that their detection from short read sequencing data is
challenging (Mills et al., 2011). Unlike detection of other types of
variation, insertion detection requires a de HOUO assembly. Typical
genotype callers, such as GATK (DePristo et al., 2011; McKenna et
al., 2010) or FreeBayes (Garrison and Marth, 2012), use only refer—
ence—aligned read pairs and, therefore, are not suitable for calling in—
sertions longer than the reads. Sequencing technologies that yield
longer reads (English et al., 2012) show promise in simplifying inser—
tion detection (Chaisson et al., 2014), but they are still not common—
place nor cost—effective on a large scale. Thus, insertions remain one
of the most challenging types of variation to detect.

Strategies for detecting insertions incorporate either a local as—
sembly of unknown sequence not present in the reference genome
(Chen et al., 2014; Hajirasouliha et al., 2010; Holtgrewe et al.,
2015; Rizk et al., 2014) or a whole—genome assembly (Bankevich
et al., 2012; Gnerre et al., 2011; Li et al., 2010; Zerbino and Birney,
2008; Zimin et al., 2013). A whole—genome assembly needs to be
followed by a comparison step of the assembled contigs to the refer—
ence genome for identifying the insertions. In the local assembly
strategy, the positions of the insertions need to be identified either
before or after assembly. For example, the strategy implemented in
the program MindT/aeGap (Rizk et al., 2014) first identifies candi—
date insertion sites without a read alignment before initiating local
assemblies, whereas the NovelSeq approach (Hajirasouliha et al.,
2010) first assembles unaligned reads before anchoring them in the
genome.

Both the whole—genome and the local assembly strategies face
difficulties when integrating the results of many individuals. This
issue is most pronounced in de novo whole—genome assembly strat—
egies and, thus, has previously been addressed. Parrish et al. (2013)
suggested a reference—guided whole—genome assembly approach that
makes the results of several samples more compatible. Iqbal et al.
(2012) developed Cortex, a program that rigorously assembles the
whole genomes of several individuals at the same time based on col—
ored de—Bruijn graphs. However, the tests in the Cortex paper were
limited to relatively few individuals or to pooled data. Furthermore,
all whole—genome assembly strategies commonly suffer from a con—
siderable demand for computational resources.

In addition, the assembly problem demands high—coverage data
(Miller et al., 2010; Zerbino et al., 2012). Assemblies from low—
coverage data are typically incomplete, i.e. fragmented and with sig—
nificant portions of the sequences missing (Alkan et al., 2011).
Hence, the application of any of the mentioned approaches on a
dataset from a single individual sequenced at insufficient coverage,
results in a largely incomplete set of insertions. Polymorphic inser—
tions with low—frequency in a population are particularly hard to
detect as they are likely to appear only at heterozygous loci.
Additionally, incomplete assemblies lead to greater difficulties in
comparing and integrating sets of insertions across multiple individ—
uals. If not carefully considered at the population level, all this can
add to an underestimation of allele frequencies, less power to detect
rare insertions, and may eventually impede association with
phenotypes.

Despite the caveats mentioned, the task of analyzing large num—
bers of individuals can also aid in the detection of insertions.
Insertions that occur within many individuals have an increased
total coverage across the whole dataset. If used in the assembly step,
this may reduce fragmentation and fill in gaps of the insertion se—
quences. The larger the number of individuals, the more likely it is
that we can capture low—frequency insertions. Thus, instead of merg—
ing insertions detected from many individuals, we can take advan—
tage of all individuals during the detection of insertions.

We have developed an approach for characterizing insertions
across a large number of individuals simultaneously using a local as—
sembly strategy. We start by assembling per individual reads that do
not align to the reference genome. Subsequently, we merge the
assemblies into a multi—individual contig set of higher quality. Each
contig in this set is then placed into the reference genome using read—
pair and split—read information. Finally, we propose a genotyping
procedure that determines for each individual the number of copies
it carries of an insertion in its diploid genome.

We have implemented the approach in a program called PopIns.
Our tests on simulated data indicate that merging of single—individual
assemblies increases the quality of insertion sequences by >20%. A
comparison to MindT/aeGap (Rizk et al., 2014) confirms that we
greatly benefit in recall from the merging step and that our approach is
precise. An additional test on data from 305 whole genomes obtained
with Illumina sequencers demonstrates its practicality on real data.

2 Problem formulation and approach

Given reference—aligned paired—end sequencing data from many indi—
viduals of the same species, the problem we deal with in this paper is
to identify a set of long novel sequence insertions with respect to the
reference genome and to determine the genotypes of all individuals
for each insertion in the set.

2.1 Polymorphic long novel sequence insertions

An insertion in a multi—individual dataset is fully defined by three at—
tributes: a position, a sequence and a genotype of each individual.
The sequence of a novel sequence insertion is not similar to any part
of the reference genome. By a long insertion, we here refer to a se—
quence longer than the sequencing reads of the given dataset. An in—
sertion is polymorphic, if it is present in one or two copies of an
individual’s diploid genome and in one or more individuals within
the given dataset at a frequency below 100%. The genotype of a sin—
gle diploid individual determines the number of copies the individual
carries of a polymorphic insertion. Possible genotypes are homozy-
gous refererence (zero copies), heterozygous (one copy) or homozy-
gous insertion (two copies).

individual to carry the insertion on 0, 1 or 2 of his chromosomal
copies based on alignment scores. As above, we consider both ends
of the insertions separately.

We compute the likelihood based on the alignment scores of all
reads r E R. Given a read r aligned to one of the two allele se—
quences S 6 {AR} with score 55, we assume P(rIS) N e“. As we are
only interested in relative likelihoods of R and A, we compute

e55

P(rIS) ~ —eSA + 85R

where 5A and sR are the alignment scores to A and R, respectively.
To ensure that a single read does not have too large of an impact in
the joint computation of the genotype likelihood described later, we
bound this relative likelihood from below by a small constant c
(default 6 : 0.0001).

If we assume that reads are sampled from the two alleles of an
individual with equal probability, we get the genotype likelihoods:

e5R
P(r(R,R) ~ —eSA +eSR

Under the assumption that the reads in R are independent, we
get the likelihoods for an individual’s genotype (S1.Sz) 6
{AR} >< {A,R}:

P(RIS1,S2) N HreRP(TIS1,S2).

Finally, we pick the genotype that has the highest likelihood as
our prediction and require this likelihood to be above 0.5 by default.

3.5 Test datasets

For performance evaluation, we simulated a dataset with poly—
morphic insertions at random positions. Furthermore, we selected a
real dataset of 305 Icelanders as described later and data from the
individual NA12878 as described in Supplementary Section 52.3.
Supplementary Section 52 describes how we process the sequencing
reads from all datasets to obtain a set of unaligned reads as input to
the subproblems.

3.5.1 Simulation of data.

Our simulation is based on human chromosome 18, GRCh37
(hg19). We simulated 100 insertions that occur at different frequen—
cies in 100 diploid individuals. In order to get realistic insertion se—
quences, we deleted 100 randomly selected regions from the
reference chromosome using the resulting sequence as our reference
and keeping the deleted sequences as insertions. We chose the
lengths of these insertions according to an exponential distribution

with a mean of 100 and always added 100 bps. Next, we uniformly
sampled a frequency between 0 and 1 for each insertion and added
the insertion sequence back into 200 copies of the modified refer—
ence at the assigned frequency. The 200 copies of the modified refer—
ence each equipped with a subset of the insertions represent a set of
200 simulated haplotypes.

For each haplotype, we simulated sequencing reads at a coverage
of 13 X . From the Mason read simulation package, version 2.0
(Holtgrewe, 2010), we used the variator tool to add SNPs and small
indels and the simulator tool to generate 5 million 101 bp paired—
end Illumina reads per haplotype. Finally, we merged the sequencing
reads of haplotype pairs to obtain data at a coverage of 26>< for 100
diploid individuals. Our dataset created with this simulation proced—
ure has an average of 32.19 heterozygous and 35.49 homozygous in—
sertions per individual.

3.5.2 Real data of 305 individuals.

To test our approach on real sequencing reads, we selected the data
of 305 Icelanders sequenced at deCODE genetics (Gudbjartsson et
al., 2015). These data were generated by Illumina HiSeq instruments
in paired—end mode with a read length of 101 bp and an average in—
sert size of 402 bp. The number of reads yielded sequencing cover—
ages between 8>< and 45 X (average 24><).

4 Results

We implemented our solutions to the merging, positioning and gen—
otyping subproblems in a program called PopIns using the Squn
C++ library (Doring et al., 2008). We assess the performance of
PopIns on the simulated dataset, compare its results to that of the
program MindT/aeGap (Rizk et al., 2014), and demonstrate its prac—
ticality on the data of 305 Icelanders. Supplementary Section 53.3.1
and Table 52 describe an additional experiment on a single Icelandic
individual that quantifies the benefit from the merging step. Further,
Supplementary Section S3.3.2—S3.3.4 compare the performance of
PopIns on data from the NA12878 individual to insertions validated
by Kim et al. (2013) and insertions predicted in the 1000 genomes
project (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010).

4.1 Performance on simulated data

Table 1 summarizes the results of PopIns on our simulated dataset.
The unaligned reads assemble into an average of 51.45 contigs per
individual, which align to 75 .5% of the 6768 simulated insertion se—
quences using Stellar (Kehr et al., 2011) with a minimal length of 50
and a maximal error rate of 5%. After merging, the supercontigs
align to 90% of the 100 simulated insertion sequences. With anchor—
ing read pairs we find approximate locations for all supercontig
ends. The anchoring score always points to the correct location if
multiple locations are suggested. For 85 supercontigs, PopIns finds

an exact insertion position for both ends using split reads. For the re—
maining five supercontigs, PopIns finds an exact insertion position
only for one end. These supercontigs turn out to be truncated with
respect to the insertion sequence by five or more base pairs at the
other end. Finally, PopIns genotypes 172 ends of insertions in all in—
dividuals correctly, reports a false position as heterozygous in 23 in—
dividuals, and discards 6 false positions in all individuals by typing
them as homozygous reference. In relation to the 6768 single—indi—
vidual insertions, this yields a recall of 85.4% and a precision of
99% after genotyping when counting only those insertions where
both ends are fully characterized. Supplementary Section 53.1 pro—
vides further details of our evaluation on simulated data.
Furthermore, we made an experiment of pooling the unaligned
reads of all individuals before assembly with velvet (using the same
parameters except for an extended coverage window of [2 10000]).
This yields only 14 contigs, a small number possibly reflecting as—
sumptions made by velvet (e.g. on even coverage), a program that
was developed for whole—genome assembly of a single individual.

4.2 Comparison to MindTheGap

We use our simulated dataset for comparison of PopIns to
MindT/aeGap (Rizk et al., 2014). We ran the index, find, and fill
commands of Mina'T/aeGap with default parameters for each indi—
vidual separately and selected all predicted insertions longer than
99 bps. In contrast to PopIns, Mina'T/aeGap first identifies potential
insertion positions and then assembles their sequences. It reports
each insertion as heterozygous or homozygous, which we interpret
as the individuals genotype in our comparison. In many cases,
Mina'T/aeGap reports several sequences per position. Following Rizk
et al. (2014), we count only one sequence per position for calculating
the precision, which gives a favorable representation of results of
Mina'T/aeGap. We aligned all sequences to the set of simulated inser—
tions (using Stellar as above) and counted a simulated insertion as
found if 90% or more of the sequence aligned to a predicted
sequence.

Table 2 shows the recall and precision of PopIns in comparison
to Mina'T/aeGap. PopIns clearly outperforms Mina'T/aeGap in terms
of recall. Further, the predictions of PopIns are more reliable in
terms of precision, even though we count only one sequence per pos—
ition for Mina'T/aeGap. We observed a much smaller difference in
recall and precision between homozygous and heterozygous inser—
tions for PopIns than for Mina'T/aeGap (data not shown).

We count predictions per individual and consider an insertion as
true positive if the position, sequence and genotype is correct.

4.3 Running times

PopIns and Mina'T/aeGap were run exclusively on Cisco 4 GHz ma—
chines with 16 GB of memory in a compute cluster. The total CPU
time used by PopIns to finish all steps from assembly to genotyping
for all individuals was 3:30 h. In comparison, Mina'T/aeGap used
35:54h in total for the index, find and fill steps of all individuals.
Thus, the computations of PopIns take ~10 times less time. The
difference is smaller between the actual walltimes that include

I/O operations but difficult to quantify as the walltimes depended
heavily on the total cluster load. Supplementary Section 532 lists
factors that influence running time in PopIns.

4.4 Performance on data of 305 human individuals

We tested the practicality of PopIns on the data of 305 Icelanders.
After processing the data as described in Supplementary Section
52.2, we obtain an average of 35 531 unaligned reads per individual.
The reads assemble into an average of 691 contigs per individual
with an average N50 of 334 and totaling to an average length of
209 kbp. The merging step reduces the set of 210 892 contigs to
8437 supercontigs including 6141 contigs that are unique to one in—
dividual. We identify two sets of individuals (of size four and six)
that have extra contigs, which are likely to originate from bacterial
species (contamination). We exclude supercontigs that were only
found in the contaminated individuals and thereby reduce the set of
supercontigs to a size of 2226 of which only 401 are unique to one
individual.

After aligning the unaligned reads to the set of supercontigs, an—
choring read pairs suggest 263 732 locations for the supercontig
ends, of which 2686 have an anchoring score above 0.3 and are sup—
ported by more than one anchoring read pair. For making a manual
evaulation of the predicted insertions possible, we restricted further
analysis to chromosome 18. Of all locations, 3968 fall on chromo—
some 18, of which 66 have an anchoring score above 0.3 and are
supported by more than one anchoring read pair. Among the 66
locations, 46 can be paired into 23 records that explain the two ends
of one supercontig. At 37 of the 66 locations we can determine the
exact position from an unambiguous set of split reads, including 14
pairs for the two ends of one supercontig. At 36 of the 37 positions,
the genotyping algorithm determines at least one individual to be a
carrier of the insertion. The insertion frequencies in the 305 individ—
uals range from 0.5 to 100%. Supplementary Figure 52 displays ex—
ample read alignments for three individuals around one of the
insertions, which visualizes that the data strongly supports the dif—
ferent genotype calls.

5 Discussion

We have introduced PopIns, a method for discovering and genotyp—
ing novel sequence insertions. PopIns takes advantage of the infor—
mation provided by many individuals, increasing the quality of the
insertion sequences and significantly improving on our ability to
determine the correct insertion position. Our local assembly ap—
proach reduces computational requirements as compared to whole—
genome assembly (Iqbal et al., 2012). On the downside, our ap—
proach depends on a read alignment and, thus, will be biased against
the reference.

The major novelty of our approach is the addition of a merging
step to a local assembly strategy. The merging subproblem is per se
an assembly problem but significantly different from the classical
genome assembly problem. The input sequences of the merging sub—
problem are themselves assembled contigs and, hence, can contain
artifacts from misassemblies. In addition, they vary in length and we
expect them in the best case not to be much shorter than the super—
contigs. Similar to transcriptome assembly, the coverage is uneven
depending on the number of individuals that are carriers of an inser—
tion and, finally, more than two haplotypes are possible for each in—
sertion locus as the contigs originate from many individuals.

Nevertheless, our solution to the merging subproblem is similar
to the overlap—layout—consensus (OLC) approach for genome

assembly (Miller et al., 2010). The use of the union—find data struc—
ture is similar to the graph used in the overlap phase of OLC
approaches; our sets of contigs correspond to connected components
in this graph. Our approach differs from the OLC approach in the
layout phase by allowing for branching components when construct—
ing supercontigs.

When finding insertion positions, PopIns greedily clusters an—
choring read pairs by location, while other SV detection methods
solve a maximum clique problem (Marschall et al., 2012; Rausch
et al., 2012). Our approach can lead to very long intervals for a sin—
gle location. But since we cluster the anchoring read pairs only per
contig and not over the whole dataset, we observe only very few ab—
normally long intervals. We discard these applying a length thresh—
old as they are unlikely to lead to a clear insertion position.

In our evaluation, we were not always able to find the insertion
position for both contig ends, which can have several reasons. If we
find a single location with anchoring read pairs but no clear position
with split reads, the contig is likely not to contain the whole insertion.
The split alignment algorithm we used penalizes all gaps in the refer—
ence. Allowing for a large gap in both the reference and the reads may
help in narrowing down the position of these insertions. Another rea—
son may be non—unique sequence being inserted together with the
novel sequence. The set of unaligned reads will not assemble into con—
tigs of non—unique sequence (e.g. mobile elements), thus,
these are missing in our approach. In many cases, this leads to many
low—scoring locations suggested by read pairs that anchor to known
occurrences of the repeated sequence. Finally, we observe read pairs
connecting several contigs, suggesting insertions of novel sequence
interspersed with non—unique sequence. An additional scaffolding step
of supercontigs would be necessary to fully characterize these cases.

In many cases, we observe the same short sequence repeated at
the two ends of an insertion (often referred to as target site duplica—
tions). If the repeated sequences become too long, our genotyping
approach has difficulties in distinguishing the reference allele from
the alternate allele. This may potentially be improved by focusing
the computation on the unique part of the sequence.

Our results on simulated data do not reflect all of these
limitations of PopIns that are due to the complex structure of real
genomic sequences. Still, we could show the practicality of the ap—
proach on real data, where it yields many novel sequence insertions.
Therefore, we are expecting a rich set of polymorphic insertion
when applying PopIns to a larger number of individuals, which will
open up the door to include novel sequence insertions in genome—
wide association studies.

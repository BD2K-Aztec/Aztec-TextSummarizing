ABSTRACT

Motivation: cddApp is a Cytoscape extension that supports the
annotation of protein networks with information about domains and
specific functional sites from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information’s conserved domain database (CDD). CDD information is
loaded for nodes annotated with NCBI numbers or UniProt identifiers
and (optionally) Protein Data Bank structures. cddApp integrates with
the Cytoscape apps structureVizZ and enhancedGraphics. Together,
these three apps provide powerful tools to annotate nodes with CDD
domain and site information and visualize that information in both net-
work and structural contexts.

Availability and implementation: cddApp is written in Java and freely
available for download from the Cytoscape app store (http://apps.
cytoscape.org). Documentation is provided at http://www.rbvi.ucsf.
edu/cytoscape, and the source is publically available from GitHub
http://github.com/RBVI/cddApp.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

The functional annotation of proteins is critical to understanding
biology. In most proteins, units of biological function are do-
mains that contain key active sites, critical structural components
or interaction sites. A single protein may contain one or more
domains, and the acquisition of domains can provide new inter-
action partners or new functions. One approach to inferring
basic protein function is to characterize the functional domains
that the protein contains. The National Center for
Bioinformatics Information’s (NCBI) conserved domain data-
base (CDD) (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2011) is a repository of
manually curated and computationally derived protein domain
family models that are searchable through a Web interface or
Web services. The conserved domains (CDs) in the CDD
database are organized into families of CDs related by
common evolutionary ancestry. Structurally and functionally im-
portant regions of the domain are annotated based on literature

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

and structural evidence wherever possible in each of the CD.
This resource is a valuable tool for researchers looking to identify
or assign functions of individual proteins.

Another commonly used tool for inference and analysis of
biological function is Cytoscape (Cline et al., 2007). Cytoscape
is an open-source desktop application for the Visualization and
analysis of biological networks, including pathways, proteine
protein interaction networks and proteineprotein similarity net-
works. Cytoscape includes an extension mechanism that allows
developers to add ‘apps’ to Cytoscape that enhance its analytical
or Visualization capabilities (Lotia et al., 2013).

Cytoscape and the CDD are complementary, but no mechan-
ism exists to allow using these tools together. We embarked on a
collaborative effort to link Cytoscape’s network Visualization
and analysis features with the CDD domain annotations to sup-
port researchers interested in exploring functional annotation of
proteins in a network context.

2 DESCRIPTION

The cddApp provides three main functions: using the CDD Web
services to search for domains in proteins in the current network,
Visualizing the domain annotations and linking the domain an-
notations to the structure through a companion app.

cddApp adds a new cddApp menu in Cytoscape’s top-level
Apps menu that has four submenus: Load CDD Domains for
Network, Load CDD Domains for selected Node(s), Show CDD
Domain Panel and Hide CDD Domain Panel. It also adds a sub-
menu in the Apps node context menu to allow loading annota-
tions for a single node and showing the domain architecture
diagram for that node. When users select one of these menu
items, they are asked for the column containing the node iden-
tiﬁer (CDD accepts GI numbers, UniProt identifiers and protein
sequences) and, optionally, a column containing the identiﬁers of
any Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2007) structures.

Once the results are available from the CDD, cddApp adds a
new Results Panel tab, CDD Domains, with a table of informa-
tion about the annotated domains and sites in a table (right side
of Fig. 1). For each domain, there is a link to open up its detailed
information at the CDD Web site. If a PDB column was selected
as part of the load and a PDB structure was annotated for a
node, the Results Panel will also contain a checkbox to open that
structure in UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004). This option

Fig. 1. This screenshot of Cytoscape with cddApp installed shows the CDD domains panel in the Cytoscape Results Panel with three nodes selected. The
bottom node is associated with a structure with two chains, and the top two nodes do not have PDB structures. The domain architecture diagram for the
top node (gi 15613153) is shown. cddApp uses the Cytoscape apps enhancedGraphics and structureViz2 to paint pie charts on nodes and show the
domain and site information on the structure, respectively. The active site and homodimer interface are shown in UCSF Chimera’s graphics window. A
high-resolution export of the network image is provided as Supplementary File 1

will only appear if the structureViz2 (Morris et al., 2007) app is
also loaded. The CDD Domains panel also has checkboxes to use
the enhancedGraphics app, if loaded, to paint pie charts for do-
mains and features onto nodes.

All CDD annotations are stored in Cytoscape’s default node
table and are saved as part of the session.

3 EXAMPLE USAGE

The structureefunction linkage database (SFLD) (Akiva et al.,
2014) is a data repository of highly curated functional annota-
tions for a set of enzyme superfamilies. The SFLD supports the
download of protein similarity networks (Atkinson et al., 2009)
containing proteins annotated to speciﬁc functional families as
well as those that have not yet been annotated.

The edges in these networks represent the similarity between a
pair of proteins, generally as measured by the BLAST (Altschul
et al., 1990) E-Value. The small sample network in Figure 1 con-
sists of a small number of proteins from the amidohydrolase
superfamin that have been annotated by PFAM (Punta et al.,
2012) as members of the phosphotriesterase (PTE) family. With
cddApp, the network was annotated using name as the primary
identifier column and pdeilename as the column containing
PDB IDs. Enabling the domain charts, one can quickly see
that the protein (gi15613153) from Bacillus halodurans has an

added domain (AAT_I superfamily) that is not present in the
other PTE proteins. This may be further demonstrated by show-
ing the domain architecture diagram (top of Fig. 1). Clicking on
the link in the Results Panel to View the detailed information on
the AAT_I superfamily fold, we learn that this domain is con-
sistent with pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes. It appears
that this protein has gained a function not present in the other
proteins in this network.

4 SIGNIFICANCE AND CONCLUSION

CDD is a powerful tool in protein classiﬁcation that allows users
to analyze protein sequences in the context of domain families.
The incorporation of CDD Via cddApp into Cytoscape should
likewise give the user additional insights into the domain com-
positions of proteins within his or her network. Additional dec-
oration of each of the nodes Via the enhancedGraphics app
displays the protein’s domain architecture in a concise format
and may uncover functional implications. The Visualization of
CDD annotations on the structures Via the structureViz2 app
will facilitate understanding the spatial relationships among
key residues and lend insight into their functional roles. The
links to the CDD Web site allow accessing the source data,

including alignments, structure links, protein record links, litera-
ture citations and sequence trees. The cddApp connects
Cytoscape and Chimera users to the wealth of resources avail-
able at CDD and NCBI, providing a new avenue to scientific
discovery. By integrating with other apps, cddApp signiﬁcantly
expands functionality without duplication, leveraging existing
knowledge. Together, these apps extend the utility of the
Cytoscape environment for functional annotation.

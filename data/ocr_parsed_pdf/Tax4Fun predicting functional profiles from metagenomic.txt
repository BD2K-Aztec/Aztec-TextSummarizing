Abstract

Motivation: The characterization of phylogenetic and functional diversity is a key element in the
analysis of microbial communities. Amplicon—based sequencing of marker genes, such as 168
rRNA, is a powerful tool for assessing and comparing the structure of microbial communities at a
high phylogenetic resolution. Because 168 rRNA sequencing is more cost—effective than whole
metagenome shotgun sequencing, marker gene analysis is frequently used for broad studies that
involve a large number of different samples. However, in comparison to shotgun sequencing
approaches, insights into the functional capabilities of the community get lost when restricting the
analysis to taxonomic assignment of 168 rRNA data.

Results: Tax4Fun is a software package that predicts the functional capabilities of microbial com—
munities based on 168 rRNA datasets. We evaluated Tax4Fun on a range of paired metagenome/
168 rRNA datasets to assess its performance. Our results indicate that Tax4Fun provides a good
approximation to functional profiles obtained from metagenomic shotgun sequencing approaches.
Availability and implementation: Tax4Fun is an open—source R package and applicable to output
as obtained from the SlLVAngs web server or the application of OIIME with a SILVA database ex—
tension. Tax4Fun is freely available for download at http://tax4fun.gobics.de/.

1 Introduction

Amplicon-based sequencing of marker genes is widely used for
large-scale studies that involve many different sampling sites or time
series. The common 16$ rRNA gene-based analysis is a powerful
tool for assessing the phylogenetic distribution of a metagenome but
does not provide insights into the communities metabolic potential.
Therefore, the prediction of the functional capabilities of a microbial
community based on marker gene data would be highly beneficial.
As a particular difficulty of such a predictive approach for most or-
ganisms in marker gene databases the genome and therefore the
functional repertoire is not known. For instance, the SILVA SSU
rRNA database (Quast et (11., 2013) (SILVA 115 full release)

contains 3 808 884 rRNA sequences whereas KEGG (Release 71.1)
(Kanehisa et (11., 2014) only comprises 2982 complete prokaryotic
genomes.

In a previous study (ABhauer and Meinicke, 2013), we intro-
duced a statistical method for predicting the metabolic profiles of a
metagenome from its taxonomic composition using a linear combin-
ation of precomputed genomic reference profiles. A similar method
has been proposed for inference of the community structure from re-
mote sensing satellite image models (Larsen et (11., 2015). In this ap-
proach, the average EC number counts of all annotated genomes
from a given taxonomic group, e.g. at order level, are used as refer-
ence for the linear combination of the community structure at this

4 Conclusion

Tax4Fun predicts the functional profile of a microbial community
just from 16S rRNA sequence data. Our approach cannot replace
whole metagenome profiling but is useful to supplement 16S rRNA
analyses in metagenome pre—studies or in situations where shotgun
sequencing is prohibitively expensive, e.g. for broad surveys in mi—
crobial ecology applications.

We evaluated our method on four paired data collections from
different habitats and compared it to the PICRUSt tool. The results
indicate a high correlation of the predicted Tax4Fun profiles with
the corresponding functional profiles obtained from whole metage—
nome sequence data. Moreover, the results show that Tax4Fun out—
performs PICRUSt on all test datasets. Additionally, our results
revealed for all datasets a higher correlation between the metage—
nomic and 16S—predicted functional profiles when using UProC in
comparison to the PAUDA tool (see Supplementary Material section
3 Figure Sl—S3).

Although we provide functional reference profiles from both
tools for Tax4Fun, we recommend the usage of Tax4Fun in combin—
ation with the UProC—based reference profiles for prediction because
of the higher sensitivity of UProC.

Tax4Fun allows easy processing of the output from SILVAngs,
QIIME or any other analysis pipeline using the SILVA database as
reference. The implementation in R facilitates further statistical ana—
lyses of the Tax4Fun predictions, which can be processed within the
same R environment.

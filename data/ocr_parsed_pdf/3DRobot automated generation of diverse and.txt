Abstract

Motivation: Computationally generated non—native protein structure conformations (or decoys) are
often used for designing protein folding simulation methods and force fields. However, almost all
the decoy sets currently used in literature suffer from uneven root mean square deviation (RMSD)
distribution with bias to non—protein like hydrogen—bonding and compactness patterns. Meanwhile,
most protein decoy sets are pre—calculated and there is a lack of methods for automated generation
of high—quality decoys for any target proteins.

Results: We developed a new algorithm, 3DRobot, to create protein structure decoys by free frag—
ment assembly with enhanced hydrogen—bonding and compactness interactions. The method was
benchmarked with three widely used decoy sets from ab initio folding and comparative modeling
simulations. The decoys generated by 3DRobot are shown to have significantly enhanced diversity
and evenness with a continuous distribution in the RMSD space. The new energy terms introduced
in 3DRobot improve the hydrogen—bonding network and compactness of decoys, which eliminates
the possibility of native structure recognition by trivial potentials. Algorithms that can automatic—
ally create such diverse and well—packed non—native conformations from any protein structure
should have a broad impact on the development of advanced protein force field and folding simu—
lation methods.

It has been more than 50 years since Anfinsen first showed that the
native structure of protein molecules corresponds to the state with
the lowest free energy (Anfinsen et (11., 1961). However, ab initio
folding of proteins from the first principle remains a significant un—
solved problem in biophysics and computational biology. One of the
major barriers is the difficulty in designing accurate force fields that
can recognize the native state as the lowest energy, and meanwhile
possess an energy funnel with a medium—range energy—RMSD correl—
ation that can guide the folding simulation towards the native state
(Bradley et (11., 2005; Zhang, 2008).

preparation of a set of non—native protein structures, usually gener—
ated by computer (called structure decoys), which can be used to
guide the design, train and benchmark of the energy terms (Park and
Levitt, 1996; Rajgaria et (11., 2008; Simons et (11., 1997; Teodorescu
et (11., 2004; Zhang et (11., 2003). However, creating appropriate
structure decoys is highly non—trivial and many efforts have been
made to address the problem. For example, Park and Levitt (1996)
proposed to construct structure decoys by randomly rotating struc—
tural segments of known native structures around a set of selected
ﬂexible hinges. Since native structure features, such as hydrophobic

core and contact specificities of amino acids, can be destroyed in the
segment permutations, the native structure can be quite easily recog—
nized by knowledge—based potentials that were extracted from the
statistics of experimental structures (Lu and Skolnick, 2001). To
partly amend this issue, Simons et al. (1997) and Xu and Zhang
(2012) generated structure decoys by ab initio folding simulations
through Rosetta and QUARK programs, respectively. Because ex—
tensive energy optimizations are conducted in the folding simula—
tions, one advantage of the folding—based decoy set is that the native
states cannot be easily recognized from the decoys by simple know—
ledge—based potentials (Deng et (11., 2012). However, one issue of
such decoy sets is that ab initio folding simulations cannot generate
near—native structure conformations (say < 313‘) due to the inherent
difficulties in ab initio folding, in particular for the medium— to
large—size proteins with complicated topology; this renders the
decoys useless for the potential development that aims to recognize
near—native structures (e.g. for high—resolution refinement).

To enrich near—native decoy generation, John and Sali (2003)
proposed to generate decoys by mutations of threading alignments
followed by comparative modeling using Modeller; similarly, Wu
et al. (2007) constructed structure decoys by iterative threading as—
sembly simulations based on I—TASSER. Because these decoys are
built on specific homologous templates, the conformations are often
aggregated into a few clusters around the template structures, which
make it difficult to examine the continuous energy funnel and the
energy—RMSD correlation of the force field—such energy funnel and
correlation are critical in guiding successful protein folding simula—
tions (Bradley et (11., 2005; Zhang, 2008).

Even though many decoy sets used in literature were generated
by extensive folding simulations, somewhat surprisingly, almost
all the currently existing decoy sets have some level of correlations
between the RMSD to the native and the radius of gyration or sec—
ondary structure distribution (see Supplementary Fig. S1). This
means that the structure deviations have been created by sacrific—
ing the hydrogen—bonding networks and/or the compactness of the
native structures in the decoy construction simulation processes.
Therefore, the native structure can be easily discriminated from
the decoys by simply counting their secondary structure density or
the compactness score. Energy training based on such decoys may
introduce extra bias to the secondary structure and compactness
weights that are not reﬂected in the native structures. To improve
the quality of the decoy structures, Yeh et al. (2015) proposed a
strategy to refine existing decoy sets by extra energy minimization
simulations; meanwhile, additional decoy structures were added
from the native structure perturbation and random dihedral angle
sampling to increase the difficulty of decoy recognition by various
scoring functions.

Finally, it is important to note that many protein folding and
structure prediction studies need structure decoys for specific protein
targets that the authors are interested in. However, most decoy sets
in literature have been pre—generated, which further limits their use
for more general studies.

In this work, we aim to develop a new algorithm, 3DRobot,
dedicated for high—quality protein decoy generation by the extension
of I—TASSER—based fragment structure assembly simulations. To in—
crease structure diversity, multiple continuously distributed struc—
ture scaffolds will be collected from the PDB library, with new
energy terms introduced to enhance the hydrogen—bonding and
residue packing interactions. The on—line server and the executable
program are freely available at http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.
edu/3DRobot, which allow users to generate high—quality structure
decoys from any given target structures.

2 Methods

3DRobot is a hierarchical algorithm for protein 3D structure decoy
generation, which consists of three steps of structure scaffold identi—
fication, fragment structure reassembly simulation, and model selec—
tion and refinement. A pipeline of 3DRobot is depicted in Figure 1.

2.1. Identification of initial structure scaffolds

Starting from the native structure of the target protein, we use TM—
align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) to thread the structure through a
representative PDB library, which consists of 27 822 non—redundant
protein structures with a pair—wise sequence identity <70%. Up to
100 non—redundant structure scaffolds (or templates) are selected from
the top structure alignments ranked by TM—score to the native struc—
ture. To ensure the diversity of scaffolds and meanwhile keep sufficient
structures in the low RMSD regions, we required a pair—wise RMSD
of the selected scaffolds to be larger than Raga/2, where ngE, is the
RMSD between the TM—align scaffolds and the target native structure.

2.2 Structure decoy reassembly simulations
Starting from the TM—align scaffolds, the full—length structure
decoys are assembled by replica—exchange Monte Carlo simulations,
based on a protocol extended from I—TASSER (Roy et (11., 2010;
Yang et (11., 2015). The target sequence is split into structurally
aligned and unaligned regions. The structure in the continuously
aligned regions with a length >5 residues will be excised from the
scaffolds and modeled off—lattice with the local structure kept un—
changed. The structure in the unaligned regions are constructed
from scratch and modeled on a lattice system with grid:0.87£‘x.
The force field of the 3DRobot simulations contains generic know—
ledge—based energy terms of solvation, hydrogen—bonding, short—
range Cot correlations, electrostatic and pair—wise contacts, extended
from I—TASSER. But different from I—TASSER simulations that were
constrained by the threading template restraints, the spatial con—
straint potential is excluded in 3Drobot to enhance the conform—
ational diversity of the assembly simulations.

To enhance the hydrogen—bonding networks and compactness of
the decoys, we introduce two new energy terms into the 3DRobot
structure assembly simulations.

2.2.1 Hydrogen-bond interactions
To enhance the hydrogen—bonding network of the structure decoys,
we collected a list of residue pairs using STRIDE (Frishman and

Argos, 1995), which have the hydrogen—bonding interactions in
either the native or the TM—align scaffold structures. A distance po—
tential is implemented to ensure the hydrogen bonds in the residue
pairs:

where nHB is the total number of hydrogen—bonding pairs collected
from the native and scaffold structures; d,- and dig are the Cat dis—
tance of the ith hydrogen—bonded residue pairs in the decoy and the
native (or scaffold if the target hydrogen bond is from the template
scaffold) structures respectively; the weighting scale wHB was set by
trial and error as twice of the weight used in the generic hydrogen—
bonding term.

The hydrogen—bonding network of the 3Drobot decoys is also
enhanced by generic hydrogen—bonding terms implemented by the sec—
ondary structure propensity. Different from I—TASSER that has the
secondary structure predicted by neural network training, the second—
ary structure in 3Drobot is taken from the PDB structures as defined
by STRIDE, where a non—coil secondary structure element (helix or
strand) is assigned if the structure element appears in either the native
or the scaffold structure following the TM—align alignments.

2.2.2 Enhanced compactness

Because most decoy sets generated by computational simulations
have a strong negative correlation between the compactness and the
deviation from the native, an additional score is introduced to en—
hance the compactness of high structure deviations, i.e.

structure decoy. The weight factor is set as

where RG and RE“ are the radiuses of gyration of the decoy and the

native structures, respectively. The radius of gyration of a protein
structure is defined by

 

where r,- is the position vector of the Cat atom of the ith residue, and
r0 is the centroid of all Cot atoms in the structure.

2.3 Decoy selection and atomic—level

structure refinement

Because spatial restraints have not been used, the 3DRobot structure
assembly simulations can generate decoys with folds very different
from the starting scaffolds. Nevertheless, 3DRobot attempts to start
the simulations from different scaffold conformations to maximize
the diversity of the architecture of decoy generations. A new decoy is
accepted only if it has a RMSD higher than nget/Z to all existing
decoys in the decoy pool. The simulation starting with specific
scaffolds will be terminated if the number of decoys reaches to
ZN/Nscaffold, where N and Nscaffold are the total number of decoys
required and the number of used TM—align scaffolds (up to 100 in this
study). This cutoff allows a quick generation of at least two times of

the requested decoys. We split the requested RMSD range into m,
bins, each with a RMSD interval 1  The decoys in each RMSD bin
are then adopted from different templates by numeration till the num—
ber of decoys in the bin reaches N/nb. Supplementary Figure S2 shows
an illustrative example of the decoy distribution starting from 13 scaf—
folds, where decoys from each RMSD bin are almost evenly adopted
from different templates. In case that an even TM—score distribution is
required, the decoys will be adopted by the same procedure, but in
the evenly split TM—score bins each with an interval of 0.1.

The decoys generated by the 3DRobot simulations are reduced
models with each residue specified by its Cot atom and side—chain
center of mass. ModRefiner (Xu and Zhang, 2011) is extended to
construct full—atom structures from the Cat traces, which also aims
to refine the local structure clashes and hydrogen—bonding networks.
The backbone atoms are quickly constructed using a look—up table
that involves four neighboring Cot atoms. The overall structures are
then relaxed and refined iteratively by a two—step energy minimiza—
tion procedure: the first step is designed for backbone structure re—
finement and the second for side—chain rotamer optimization, which
are guided by a composite physics— and knowledge—based force field
as described by Xu and Zhang (2011). The structure refinement
does not change the global fold of the structure decoys (typically
with a Cot—RMSD to the initial model below 1—2 A); therefore the
evenness of the decoy distribution is not affected. But the hydrogen—
bonding networks (as assessed by the HB—score) and the physical
quality [as assessed by MolProbity score (Chen et (11., 2010)] can be
significantly improved as demonstrated by the large—scale bench—
mark tests (Xu and Zhang, 2011).

3 Results

3.1 Decoy datasets

To examine 3DRobot, we chose to test the method in control with
three widely used decoy sets, which were generated by the represen—
tative structure modeling methods, including ab initio folding by
Rosetta (Simons et (11., 1997), homology modeling by Modeller
(John and Sali, 2003), and multiple threading assembly simulation
from I—TASSER (Wu et (11., 2007).

3.1.1 Rosetta sets

The original Rosetta decoy sets (referred as ‘Rosetta_set’) contains
decoys for 58 proteins ranging in length from 50 to 146 residues, with
each containing 100 structure decoys by the Rosetta ab initio struc—
ture prediction. Since structures with a super—high RMSD (e.g.
>~12A) are usually considered equally bad and useless to most appli—
cations, we made an arbitrary but uniform RMSD cutoff at 12A for
both decoy generation and evaluation. We further exclude 17 proteins
in Rosetta_set whose number of decoys with RMSD < 12A is fewer
than 50. The remaining 41 decoy sets have an average of 90 structure
decoys for each set after removing the decoys with RMSD > 12

3.1.2 Modeller sets

The Modeller decoy sets (referred as ‘Modeller_set’) contains decoys
for 20 proteins with length from 81 to 340 residues, which include
on average 194 decoys for each target with RMSD < 12A. These
decoys were built by the homology—modeling tool Modeller, com—
bined with alignment mutation and refinement.

3.1.3 I-TASSER sets
The I—TASSER decoy sets (referred as ‘I—TASSER_set’) contains
decoys for 56 proteins with length from 47 to 118 residues; each

protein contains 300—500 decoys which were first generated by
I—TASSER simulations and then refined by GROMACS4.0 MD en—
ergy minimization (Hess et (11., 2008; Zhang et (11., 2011). On aver—
age, 401 decoys for each protein are evaluated after removing those
with RMSD > 12 .4.

3.1.4 3DRobot sets

For each of the three decoy sets, 3DRobot generates a set of N struc—
ture decoys with N equal to the average number of decoys in the cor—
responding sets. In addition, we implement 3DRobot on a set of 200
non—redundant proteins culled by PISCES (Wang and Dunbrack,
2003) from the PDB with a pair—wise sequence identity <20%, con—
taining 48 at, 40 l)’ and 112 01/]? single—domain proteins with length
from 80 to 250 residues. 300 decoys are constructed by 3DRobot
for each target. All the 3DRobot decoys can be downloaded at
http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/3DRobot/decoys.

3.2 Evenness of decoy distributions
Ideal structure decoys should have the structural conformations scat—
tered in all interested regimes from near— to distant—native states so
that the entire landscape of protein folding force fields could be ap—
propriately assessed. Because the structural space is nearly infinite,
however, it is not possible to have a limited number of decoys cover—
ing all the structural space. When projecting the high—dimension struc—
tural space to the 1D RMSD space, the number of decoys increases
rapidly with the increase of RMSD. On the other hand, the decoys
with a smaller RMSD are generally more important than the decoys
with a larger RMSD when they are used for training protein folding
potentials where sufficient near—native structures are needed to par—
ameterize the subtle atomic interactions. Considering the two reverse
tendencies, a relatively even distribution in the RMSD space should
be desirable for decoy generation. Meanwhile, the requirement for an
even RMSD distribution can help avoid significant gaps in the RMSD
space and thus allow the assessment of energy potential in various
resolutions ranging from near— to distant—native states.

To evaluate the evenness of decoy distributions, we divide the
RMSD space into m, bins (each with an interval 1 A), and define an
Evenness score of a set of N decoys as

Evenness : 1 —

 

where n,- is the number of decoys in the ith RMSD bin, ﬁ : N / m, is
the average number of decoys in each bin. Here, we only consider

the decoys in [0, 12A] and m, : 12. The Evenness score has value in
[0, 1], with 1 corresponding to the decoys eventually distributed
among all bins, and 0 to the extreme case that has all decoys aggre—
gated into a single bin.

Column 4 of Table 1 lists the Evenness value of different decoys.
The average Evenness for the Rosetta_set and I—TASSER_set are
0.502 and 0.475, respectively, which indicates significant gaps exist—
ing in the space of structural resolution. The low Evenness in
Rosetta_set is mainly due to the difficulty of ab initio protein folding
in generating low—RMSD structures, especially for proteins with a
large size of complicated topology. Although 17 proteins with none
or only a few decoys with RMSD < 12A have been excluded, there
are still many proteins in the remaining 41 sets where no decoy has
a RMSD, 5  In contrast to Rosetta_set, the majority of the
I—TASSER decoys are near native since the I—TASSER simulation
started from LOMETS threading templates with strong spatial re—
straints. But there are no sufficient structures in the I—TASSER_set
with a high RMSD to the native, where 10 out of the 56 proteins
have no decoys with RMSD above 4A. The Evenness score in the
Modeller_set is slightly higher (0.696), but there are still more than
50% of the proteins having no decoys with RMSD below 3  The
same issue exists for many other frequently used decoy sets, includ—
ing the QUARK set (Xu and Zhang, 2012), the ModEM sets (Topf
et (11., 2005), the Decoys ‘R’ Us (Samudrala and Levitt, 2000), and
the CASP10 decoys generated by the participant servers, which all
have an average Evenness score below 0.5.

When compared with the above—mentioned decoy sets, the even—
ness of the 3DRobot decoys is significantly increased, which has an
Evenness score above 0.9 in all the protein sets (Table 1). The high
Evenness score in the 3DRobot decoys is mainly attributed to the
well—scheduled scaffold and decoy selection procedures and the re—
straint—free fragment assembly simulations that allow the generation
of structure models of different similarity to the native.

Figure 2 summarizes the evenness comparison for individual pro—
teins of all the decoy sets. As expected, depending on the protein
type and the difficulty in structure prediction, a high Evenness ﬂuc—
tuation is observed in all the three control decoy generators, which
are rarely beyond 0.75. The Evenness scores of 3DRobot decoys are
constantly above 0.85, showing the robustness of 3DRobot in gener—
ating evenly distributed decoys in the RMSD space for different type
of proteins.

Here we note that the cutoff of RMSD used in Evenness defin—
ition and 3DRobot decoy selection is subjective. We have chosen the
range of [0, 12 A] with the purpose to maximize the comparability
between 3DRobot decoys and the control sets because this is the

range that most of the current structure decoy sets cover. In the
3DRobot server and the standalone program, an option has been
given to allow users to choose any RMSD range in which an even
distribution of structure decoys is to be created. Meanwhile, we
have selected RMSD as the primary metric in 3DRobot because
RMSD is the structural similarity measurement that is most widely
used in the community. But it is well known that RMSD suffers
from its sensitivity to local structural similarity. To address this
issue, 3DRobot also has an option to select structural similarity cut—
off based on TM—score that is less sensitive to the local structure
ﬂuctuation and with the physical meaning of the absolute TM—score
value independent of the protein length (Zhang and Skolnick,
2004). When a TM—score cutoff is specified, the templates and decoy
structures in 3DRobot will be selected to maximize the evenness dis—
tributions in the TM—score space.

3.3 Diversity of structure decoys

Structure decoys must be non—redundant from each other so that a
limit number of decoys can cover a maximum conformational space
for the force field evaluations. Considering that the near—native
decoys have a higher opportunity to be structurally close to each
other than the decoys with a high RMSD due to the geometrical con—
straints, we define a normalized pair—wise RMSD to assess the diver—
sity of structure decoys:

N RMSD,”-

2
RMSD : — —
npw 30 N(N _ 1) RMSD30,(1’iv 177 L)

(6)

where N is the total number of decoys in the set, RMSD,-,,- is the
RMSD between 1th and jth decoys (i 94 j). RMSD30n(r,-,r,-,L) is a nor—
malization function from random structure pairs which we intro—
duce to eliminate the dependence of pair—wise RMSD of decoys on
their RMSDs to the native, where r,- and r,- are RMSD of 1th and jth
decoys to the native and L is the protein length. To compute
RMSD30n(r,-,r,-,L), we collected a pool of 4928 non—redundant PDB
structures with a pair—wise sequence identity below 30%, which is
what the names of ‘nprMSD30’ and ‘RMSD30’ refer to. We first
select one PDB structure as a reference structure with length L, and
then calculate the average RMSD,-,,- between all pairs of other pro—
teins in the pool that have RMSD : r,- and 17, respectively, to the ref—
erence structure. RMSD30n(r,-,r,-,L) is then calculated as the average
of RMSD,” for all reference proteins that has a length L. When we
calculate r,- and 17, we only count for the proteins that have a length
above L, which are compared with the reference by gapless match—
ing. The matching region with the lowest RMSD to the reference
structure is then used to calculate the pair—wise RMSD,-,,-. For simpli—
city, we only count pairs with r, and r,- below 20 A, which are split

into 40 bins with bin—wide : 0.5  In Supplementary Figure S3, we
present an example of RMSD30n(r,r,L) with the first two r,- and r,-
being identical. The data clearly shows that the average RMSD be—
tween random structure pairs increases regard to both RMSD to the
native and the length of proteins.

Here, although we used a specific sequence identity cutoff (30%)
for creating the non—redundant structure pool, the distribution of
RMSDn(r,-,r,-,L) is actually insensitive to the cutoff selection because
the majority of the randomly selected structural pairs in the PDB
have the sequence identity far below 30%. In fact, we have tried to
increase or reduce the sequence identity cutoff (or introduce add—
itional structural similarity cutoff using TM—score calculated by
TM—align). But we found that there is no obvious difference in the
RMSDn(r,-,r,-,L) from the data presented in Supplementary Figure S3.
Thus, for the purpose of briefness, we will use ‘nprMSD’ instead
of ‘nprMSD30’ in the data presentation afterwards.

The normalized pair—wise RMSD between decoys, nprMSD, is
generally between [0, 1], with nprMSD : 0 meaning that all
decoys are identical and nprMSD : 1 meaning that the diversity
of structure decoys is comparable to that from random protein pairs.
Although the necessary diversity of decoys may change depended on
the method and force field that the decoys are used to train for, the
nprMSD defined sets up an objective metric to evaluate the diver—
sity that is independent of the RMSD range and the methods that
are used to generate the decoys. As shown in Column 6 of Table 1,
the Modeller_set has a slightly higher diversity (0.867) than the
I—TASSER_set (0.730) and Rosetta_set (0.713). But the nprMSD
in the corresponding 3DRobot decoys was increased to 0.960, 0.940
and 0.935, respectively.

Figure 3 summarizes the nprMSD scores for all proteins in the
three decoy sets. Since Rosetta, Modeller and I—TASSER used spe—
cific ab initio and template—based modeling approaches to generate
the model predictions, the diversity of the structure decoys is sensi—
tive to the difficulty of the targets, whereby a high fluctuation is
observed in all the decoys by the original simulation methods. In
contrast, 3DRobot decoys have a steady and high nprMSD score
for all the proteins. The data demonstrates again the ability and ro—
bustness of 3DRobot in constructing diverged structure conform—
ations for different type of protein folds.

3.4 Native structure recognition using trivial

scoring function

Non—native structure decoys can be generated by deforming the na—
tive conformations (Park and Levitt, 1996). But brute—force deform—
ation can break basic structure characteristics such as the hydrogen—
bonding network or packing interactions. In fact, the decoys gener—
ated by many practical structure prediction methods are also prone

to various unphysical structural biases, which make the native struc—
tures easily recognizable from such decoy sets (Handl et 41]., 2009;
Park et 41]., 1997; Vajda et 41]., 2013). Since a high—quality decoy set
should have the ability to ‘fool’ most of the generic scoring functions
in native structure recognition (Yeh et 41]., 2015), here we designed
two simple scores to test the decoy sets.

3.4.1 Percentage of secondary structure

Protein secondary structure elements (including alpha—helix and
beta—sheet) are formed by regular arrangement of hydrogen—bonding
networks of the backbone atoms. The hydrogen—bonding networks
can be roughly counted by the percentage of secondary structure:

Nsec
L

 

Psec : X 100 (7)
where NSec is the total number of residues which are assigned as
helix or strand by STRIDE (Frishman and Argos, 1995) and L is the
length of protein chain.

As shown in Table 1 (Column 8), the native structure in many of
the control decoys can be recognized by simply counting Psec. For ex—
ample, 66% of proteins in the I—TASSER_set have the native structure
with the highest Psec. The problem is more significant for the beta—
proteins since the long—range H—bonding can be easily broken in beta—
sheets. Out of the 13 beta—proteins, 8 proteins have the native with
the highest PM, while the number is only 5 in the 15 alpha—proteins.
Similarly, 55% of proteins in the Modeller_set have the native struc—
ture with the highest Psec. Rosetta_set performs much better than
I—TASSER_set and Modeller_set but still has 7% of the cases that
have the native structure recognizable by Psec. In Figure 4, we listed
the PSec of decoys versus the native structures for all individual pro—
teins in the three decoy sets. It is shown that the secondary structure
of the native is clearly outside the decoy ﬂuctuation region of the
decoys for a number of proteins in the I—TASSER_set and
Modeller_set, while the native is non—distinguishable from the decoys
in all the 3DRobot decoys and most of the Rosetta_set.

ations. The solid error bar denotes the standard deviation of Psec for
each decoy set. The dotted line with bar shows Psec range of each decoy set.
(A) l-TASSEFLset; (B) Modelleriset; (C) Rosettaiset

We also calculated the Z—score of PM, defined as the difference
of the native from the mean in the unit of standard deviation, which
measures how significant the PSec of the native structure differ from
the decoys. The I—TASSER_set has the highest PSec Z—score (3.61),
followed by Modeller_set (2.23) and Rosetta_set (1.23). The aver—
age Z—score of PSec by 3DRobot is below 1.0 for all decoy sets, indi—
cating that there is no significant difference in hydrogen bonding
between 3DRobot decoys and the native structures despite the high
RMS derivation. In Figure 5, we present 2 typical examples from the
I—TASSER and Modeller decoy sets from the translation initiation
factor (PDB ID: 1tig) and insect fatty acid binding protein (PDB ID:
1mdc), respectively. In both cases, the original decoy generators
failed to generate sufficient secondary structure for a high structure
deviation (RMSD > 9A) but 3DRobot has successfully created
structure decoys with the PSec score close to the native structure.

3.4.2 Radius of gyration
The native structure of globular proteins is usually tightly packed in
cells with the radius of gyration approximately following Re—
2.2L0‘38 (Zhang et 41]., 2003). Column 10 of Table 1 lists the recog—
nition results of the native structure by Re in the three decoy sets.
More than 1/4 of the proteins in the Rosetta_set can have the native
structure recognized by Re, which has an average Z—score of 1.84.
The Modeller_set and I—TASSER_set only have 2 and 7 cases that
have the native recognized by Re. The average Z—score of Re of
Modeller_set and I—TASSER_set are 0.91 and 1.47, respectively,
which are also lower than Rosetta_set (1.84). This is probably be—
cause Modeller and I—TASSER started from structure templates,
which makes it easier to have native—like compactness than the ab
initio structure folding simulations. However, we noticed that for
the proteins whose compactness is notably higher or lower than that
of common globular protein, the decoys by the template—based
methods also tend to be significantly different from the native.
Column 11 shows the RG recognition results for the decoys by
3DRobot. Since specific constraints to the native are considered in
3DRobot [see Equations (2—4) in Methods section), none of the na—
tive structure could be recognized by Re in the 3DRobot decoys in
the three decoy sets. There is only one target in the 3DRobot_set

(PDB ID: 3ci3), which has an alpha—helix bundle fold but with two
extended long tails that results in Re higher than the decoy struc—
tures that have tails folded. The average Z—score of the 3DRobot
decoys is generally below 0.70, which is lower than all the control
decoy sets.

We also examined the compactness of decoys by simply counting
the total number of residue pairs in contact (71mm), with a separ—
ation>5 residues and a Cat distance < 8A. A similar result to the
radius of gyration were obtained, i.e. 11, 2 and 8 cases have the na—
tive structure recognized by 71mm in the Rosetta_set, Modeller_set
and I—TASSER_set, respectively. But there is no native structure rec—
ognized by 71mm in the 3DRobot decoys.

Here we note that the concepts of PSec and Re have been intro—
duced as criterions to assess the quality of the decoys in native struc—
ture recognition. However, these criterions should not (or cannot)
be considered as restraints on structure folding simulations, because
the native structure does not necessarily have the extreme PSec and
RG scores. Meanwhile, the assessments for the decoy sets require the
information of the native structure, which is not available in the
structure prediction simulations.

3.5 Correlation of RMSD with simple scoring function
Instead of ranking the native structure, another approach to assess
the quality of the structure decoys is to examine the Pearson correl—
ation of the structure deviation with the simple or trivial potentials,
such as percentage of secondary structure and structural compact—
ness. However, it should be noted that the face value of the Pearson
correlation is often dependent on the range of the RMSD distribu—
tion of the decoys. As shown in Supplementary Figure S4, e.g. there
are no obvious correlations for the decoys in the local RMSD ranges.
But a significant correlation coefficient (>0.8) can be obtained for
the same decoy sets if we consider the overall RMSD range; this is
often the issue for decoy sets with a low Evenness score. To reduce
the bias from RMSD range, we only focus on the targets that have
an Evenness score above 0.75 and calculate the Pearson correlation
based on the same RMSD range (i.e. delete the decoys in the bins if
the control sets have no decoy in these bins).

Table 2 lists a summary of the correlation between RMSD and
the simple scoring function from the secondary structure percentage
and the radius of gyration, respectively. The most noticeable correl—
ations are the correlation between PSec and RMSD from
Modeller_set, which has a correlation coefficient of —0.739. In our
unpublished data, we observed a strong correlation between RMSD
and compactness for most of the decoy sets that generated by native
structure perturbations. This correlation is not strong for the decoys
generated by the structure simulations by the three control decoy

sets. However, there are several cases where a strong RMSD—RC; cor—
relation was observed in each of the decoy sets.

In Figure 6, we present four illustrative examples where the con—
trol decoy sets show a strong RMSD—PSec or RMSD—RG correlation,
where 3DRobot generated decoys with a much lower correlation.
The average correlation coefficients by 3DRobot are all lower than
the control decoy sets, except for Rosetta_set that has a slightly
lower correlation in RMSD—PSec than 3DRobot; but Rosetta has the
highest RMSD—RC; correlation (see Table 2).

3.6 Native structure recognition using knowledge—based
statistical potentials
In addition to the simple scoring functions, we also examined the
decoys using more sophisticated knowledge—based potentials,
including DFIRE (Zhou and Zhou, 2002), DOPE (Shen and Sali,
2006), KPB (Lu and Skolnick, 2001), RAPDF (Samudrala and
Moult, 1998), RW (Zhang and Zhang, 2010) and SRS (Rykunov
and Fiser, 2007), which have been widely used in protein model rec—
ognition studies. All these potentials were derived from the statistics
of known protein structures in the PDB library based on the
Boltzmann formulation but using different reference states, includ—
ing ideal—gas (Zhou and Zhou, 2002), spherical non—interaction
(Shen and Sali, 2006), quasi—chemical approximation (Lu and
Skolnick, 2001), atomic average (Samudrala and Moult, 1998), ran—
dom—walk (Zhang and Zhang, 2010) and atomic shufﬂing
(Rykunov and Fiser, 2007). Since the original potentials were
derived using different training datasets, to have a clear examination
of the reference states we re—derived the potentials using the original
reference formulas but based on a uniform, non—redundant set of
1022 high—resolution structures collected by PISCES server (Wang
and Dunbrack, 2003). These re—derived potentials are labeled by a
suffix ‘_REF’ to distinguish them from the original potentials.

In Table 3, we list the number of cases in which the native struc—
ture has the lowest energy (Nmt) and the average Z—score of the na—
tive structure when evaluated by each of the six potentials. RW—REF

Z—score : 2.91 from KBP—REF, which confirm the observation made
by the earlier sections and the previous studies, i.e. the native struc—

To clearly highlight the difference between the 3DRobot and the
control decoys, in Table 4 we present the average results of Nmt and
Z—score values from the six potentials. The data again show that the
native structure could be recognized with high rate by the know—
ledge—based potentials, in particular from the decoys in the
Modeller_set and I—TASSER_set, where the native structure was
ranked as with the lowest energy in 95% and 89% of the cases,
respectively. It is relatively more difficult to recognize the native
structure from the Resetta_set, where there are on average 12%
of the cases that have the native with the lower energy. The average
Z—score of the native structure by the six potentials is 2.27, 2.97 and
5 .03 for the Rosetta_set, Modeller_set and I—TASSER_set,

erated by I—TASSER in Figure 7D has a low RMSD (2.83 A) but
there are many local sites that have energetically unfavorable con—
tacts as highlighted by the dark dots (Fig. 7B); this results in an over—
all DOPE_REF energy of —493.7 that is much higher than that of
the native structure (Fig. 7A). But in the decoy structure generated
by 3DRobot, the high—energy spots disappear and the overall energy
is —6317.3 (Fig. 7C), which is considerably lower than the native al—
though the RMSD of the decoy is rather high (6.08 A). Similar ob—
servation was obtained when the decoys are evaluated by other
individual knowledge—based potentials. This example demonstrates
the importance of the local structure packing for high quality decoy
structure generations.

4 Conclusion

Despite the central importance of structure decoys in protein folding
strategy and force field developments, we found that almost all the
currently used decoy sets suffer from significant issues in evenness
distribution and structure diversity. Most of the existing decoy sets
generate diversity by sacrificing the hydrogen—bonding networks and
compactness, which render the native structures easily discriminable
by simple calculations of regular secondary structure density and
radius of gyration scores. The ﬂawed decoys can result in non—
protein—like bias when used for force field optimization and fold rec—
ognition training.

We developed a new decoy generation algorithm, 3DRobot, by
extending the fragment assembly simulation protocol that starts
from multiple structure scaffolds identified from the PDB library,
with new potentials introduced to enhance the hydrogen—bonding
network and compactness for high deviation conformations.
3DRobot was tested in control with three most widely used struc—
ture decoy sets generated by ab initio folding [Rosetta (Simons et (11.,
1997)], homology modeling [Modeller (John and Sali, 2003)] and
threading assemble simulation [I—TASSER (Wu et (11., 2007)]. The
structure decoys generated by 3DRobot are found to have a signifi—
cantly enhanced evenness and diversity score than that of control
sets. This is mainly due to the fact that 3DRobot free fragment as—
sembly simulations start from a set of optimally selected multiple
templates designed with different levels of resolutions, while most of
the control decoy sets were generated by the modeling simulations
that aim to generate the best structure predictions; the structure dis—
tributions in these control decoy sets therefore depend on the diffi—
culty of the target type. Here, although the decoys have been
generated under the guidance of a modified I—TASSER scheme, there
is no specific effort made on the decoys for I—TASSER force field re—
finements. In fact, a previous study has shown that decoys generated
from one force field (e.g. I—TASSER) are generally more helpful for
the parameter optimization of other force fields because the decoy
conformations have not been overly optimized for the other force
field (Zhang et (11., 2003). Therefore, the fact that decoys are guided
by the generalized I—TASSER potential should not necessarily affect
their usefulness on testing and training of other force fields. In the
meantime, appropriate combination of the decoy structures gener—
ated by other programs, such as CABS—flex (Jamroz et (11., 2013),
CAS—fold (Blaszczyk et (11., 2013), Modeller (John and Sali, 2003),
QUARK (Xu and Zhang 2012) and Rosetta (Simons et (11., 1997),
should help further enhance the generality and the conformational
coverage of the decoys.

Further data analysis also showed that the new energy terms
introduced in 3DRobot can improve the hydrogen—bonding net—
works and the compactness of structure decoys, which eliminate the
possibility of native structure being recognized by trivial potentials
as what most of the control decoy sets suffer. Finally, the decoy
structures are tested by the more sophisticated knowledge—based po—
tentials that were derived from the regularities of the high—resolution
PDB structures. It was found that the native structure is more diffi—
cult to be recognized in the 3DRobot decoys than in the control
decoys, where the number of cases that the native was ranked as the
lowest is more than 20 times lower (or 4.8 time lower than the best
Rosetta_set) in the 3DRobot decoys. Detailed analyses showed that
the 3DRobot decoys have the local structures better packed, which
makes the native structure more difficult to recognize. The robust
decoy generations with less unphysical bias that are resistant to na—
tive recognition from trivial potential should have important useful—
ness and impact on designing and training protein folding force field

and folding simulation methods. Here, one purpose for examining the
3DRobot decoys on the trivial (e.g. secondary structure and radius of
gyration) and more sophisticated knowledge—based (e.g. Dfire and RW
etc) potentials was to demonstrate the difference (or advantage) of
3DRobot from other decoy generators. It will be of interest to apply
the 3DRobot decoys to test the performance of some of the more mod—
ern Model Quality Assessment Programs (MQAPs) [e.g. QMEAN4
(Benkert et (11., 2008) and ProQ2 (Ray et (11., 2012)] and more compre—
hensive potentials (Rosetta, QUARK and I—TASSER); the correspond—
ing study is under progress and will be presented elsewhere.

Finally, we note that during the 3DRobot simulations many local
structure features of the native structure (such as secondary structure
and compactness) have been reinforced in order to eliminate the cor—
relation between RMSD and the local structural characteristics and
enhance the difficulty of the native structure recognition by trivial
potentials. These decoy sets should find their usefulness in training
the force fields for fold recognition and structure prediction that aim
to identify the best final structure models. But cautions should be
born when applying the decoys to training force field and models for
protein folding simulations and dynamics, because the decoys have
incorporated various levels of the characteristics of the native struc—
tures. Nevertheless, the force field that the nature uses to fold pro—
teins (if such force field exists) may only favor the native secondary
structure and does not necessarily have such correlation between
RMSD and secondary structure. Further studies and experiments are
needed to address these issues.

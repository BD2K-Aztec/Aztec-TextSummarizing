Abstract

Motivation: The distribution of allele frequencies across polymorphic sites, also known as the site
frequency spectrum (SFS), is of primary interest in population genetics. It is a complete summary
of sequence variation at unlinked sites and more generally, its shape reflects underlying population
genetic processes. One practical challenge is that inferring the SFS from low coverage sequencing
data in a straightforward manner by using genotype calls can lead to significant bias. To reduce
bias, previous studies have used a statistical method that directly estimates the SFS from sequenc—
ing data by first computing site allele frequency (SAF) likelihood for each site (i.e. the likelihood a
site has each possible allele frequency conditional on observed sequence reads) using a dynamic
programming (DP) algorithm. Although this method produces an accurate SFS, computing the
SAF likelihood is quadratic in the number of samples sequenced.

Results: To overcome this computational challenge, we propose an algorithm, 'score—limited DP’
algorithm, which is linear in the number of genomes to compute the SAF likelihood. This algorithm
works because in a lower triangular matrix that arises in the DP algorithm, all non—negligible values
of the SAF likelihood are concentrated on a few cells around the best—guess allele counts. We show
that our score—limited DP algorithm has comparable accuracy but is faster than the original DP
algorithm. This speed improvement makes SFS estimation practical when using low coverage
NGS data from a large number of individuals.

1 Introduction

 

A site frequency spectrum (SFS) describes the distribution of allele
frequencies across sites in the genome of a particular species. The
SFS is of primary interest in population genetics, as it is a complete
summary of sequence variation at unlinked sites and its shape
reﬂects underlying population genetic processes, such as growth,
bottlenecks and selection. Moreover, a number of population
genetic inferences can proceed directly from the SFS. For example,
demographic history (e.g. evidence for population expansions,

bottlenecks 0r migrations) can be directly inferred from the SFS
[using, for example, dadi (Gutenkunst et al., 2009) or (Excoffier et
al., 2013)]. The SFS can also be compressed down to univariate sum—
mary statistics that form the basis of popular neutrality tests (Achaz,
2008, 2009; Fay and Wu, 2000; Fu and Li, 1993; Tajima, 1989)
that underlie many empirical genome—Wide selection scans (e.g.
Andolfatto, 2007; Begun et al., 2007). Hence, inferring the precise
SFS from genetic data is crucial in many population genetic
analyses.

Fast and accurate SFS estimation

 

With the recent rapid progress in sequencing techniques, obtain—
ing large—scale genomic data from thousands to tens of thousands of
individuals is practical (e.g. 1000 Genomes Project Consortium,
2010, 2012; Fu et (11., 2013; Nelson et (11., 2012) and this increased
sample size enables us to conduct more accurate population genetic
inference. However, current massively parallel short—read sequence
technologies also pose many inherent challenges—for example,
reads have high error rates, read mapping is sometimes uncertain
and coverage is variable and in many cases low or completely ab—
sent. These challenges make accurate individual—level genotype calls
difficult and make some downstream analysis based on the inferred
genotypes problematic.

In a previous study (Han et al., 2014), we showed that the SFS
computed from genotype calls (a call-based estimation approach) is
biased at low to medium coverage (£10>< ), whereas the SFS directly
inferred from aligned short—read sequencing data (a direct
estimation approach) is unbiased even at low coverage. The direct
estimation approach infers the maximum likelihood estimate
(MLE) of the SFS by an EM algorithm (Li, 2011) or a
Broyden—Fletcher—Goldfarb—Shanno (BFGS) algorithm (Nielsen et
al., 2012), assuming independence across all individuals and sites.
Both of these algorithms are implemented in the ANGSD software
package (Nielsen et al., 2012).

Both of these algorithms require computation of the site allele
frequency (SAF) likelihood for all sites. These vectors contain the
likelihood that an allele for each possible allele frequency at a site
(regardless whether monomorphic or polymorphic) conditional on
observed sequence reads. Based on the precomputed SAF likeli—
hoods, the MLE of the SFS is obtained by optimization, using either
the EM (Li, 2011) or the BFGS algorithm (Nielsen et al., 2012). The
bottleneck in obtaining the MLE of the SFS is computing the SAF
likelihoods, rather than optimization. In fact, the maximization of
the likelihood either by the EM or the BFGS algorithm takes only a
small fraction of time compared with the computation of the SAF
likelihood. This is because computation of the SAF likelihood at
each site requires a summation over all possible genotype combin—
ations for 71 individuals and naive computation of this sum has a
runtime complexity of 0(3”). To overcome this computational bur—
den, Li (2011) proposed a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to
effectively compute the SAF likelihood for each site in 0(n2) and
Nielsen et al. (2012) implemented this algorithm in the ANGSD
software. However, this algorithm is still not practical to use if there
are large numbers of individuals, because it is quadratic in the num—
ber of genomes (see Fig. 1B for runtime). Moreover, this algorithm
is numerically unstable for a large sample (Li, 2011). To solve this
problem of computational inefficiency and numerical instability, we
compute the SAF likelihood in a more efficient way that still retains
the accuracy of the original DP algorithm. Our new method uses a
combination of rescaling and sensible approximation to compute
the SAF likelihood.

2 Approach

To establish notation and background, we first review the existing
DP algorithm implemented in the ANGSD software (Nielsen et al.,
2012) and then introduce our approach.

2.1 DP algorithm used by ANGSD

Let D denote the short—read sequencing data and X represent a
total count of the derived allele for a sample of n diploid indi—
viduals at a particular site. The corresponding SAF likelihood,

at coverage 3x, 5x and 10x with the error rate of 0.001 and the sample size
of 50, 100, 300, 500, 750 and 1000. Note that experiments are only performed
with n31000, and the results for n > 1000 (the dotted line in A and the last
two rows of B) are extrapolated from the results with n§1000

h : (170,171,. . Jog”), is a (2n + 1)—dimensional vector in which each

Derived allele counts

Fig. 2. Updating the SAF likelihood for 50 diploid individuals at a particular
site fixed for an ancestral allele by the original (A) or the rescaled (B) DP
algorithm. The sequencing data were simulated at coverage 3x with
sequencing error rate of 0.001. Genotype likelihoods were calculated using a
Genome Analysis Tool Kit model (DePristo et al., 2011). (A) Top row shows
how the raw SAF likelihood is recurrently updated by the original DP algo-
rithm. Each row in a low triangular matrix represents the raw SAF likelihood
forjindividuals (zi). The value of the SAF likelihood is shown in a color scale,
of which the range goes from 0 to 2000. Middle and bottom rows show how
the raw SAF likelihood z'1 (the last row of the lower triangular matrix) is con-
verted to the final SAF likelihood h by rescaling and standardization. Note
that the final SAF likelihood h has a peak at the derived allele count of 0. (B)
Top row shows how the rescaled SAF likelihood is recurrently updated by the
rescaled DP algorithm. Each row in the lower triangular matrix represents the

rescaled SAF likelihood hi for 1' individuals. The value of the SAF likelihood is
shown in a color scale, of which the range goes from 0 to 1. Bottom row
shows the final SAF likelihood h. In both (A) and (B), the gray area represents
the range of values computed by the original and the rescaled DP algorithm.
In this example, it requires computation of 2600 elements (because

3, 5+...1101:  2i+ 1)to updatethe SAF likelihood

2.2 Rescaled DP algorithm

In our preliminary work, we observed that the value at the mode of
2‘1 can be relatively large. In this example with 50 diploid individ—
uals, the mode of z‘1 is 1973. With 500 diploid individuals, the mode
of 2‘1 can be about 8 X 1012 (data not shown). This implies that the
DP algorithm can have an arithmetic overﬂow problem (i.e. a com—
puted value is greater in magnitude than the largest value that a
computer can store in memory) for large samples because the mode
of 2‘1 increases exponentially as the sample size increases.
Furthermore, the values at the edges of z‘1 are very small. In this ex—
ample with 50 individuals, the value of the SAF likelihood function
for the derived allele count of 100 is 7 X 10‘110. With 500 diploid
individuals, the value of the SAF likelihood function for the derived
allele count of 1000 is smaller than 10‘300 (data not shown). This
implies that the DP algorithm can have an arithmetic underflow
problem (i.e. a computed value is smaller in magnitude than the
smallest value that a computer can store in memory) for large sam—
ples because the values at the edges of 2‘1 keep decreasing exponen—
tially as sample size increases. Therefore, the original DP algorithm
will be numerically unstable for large samples, as the computation
of 2‘1 creates both numerical overﬂow (at the mode of z“) and under—
ﬂow (away from the mode).

To overcome the numeric instability of the DP algorithm, we
modified the original DP algorithm such that rescaling and stand—
ardization take place at each step of updating the SAF likelihood.
For this modified algorithm, we define a rescaled SAF likelihood for

/' individuals ((2/+ 1)—dimensional vector), hi :  l/in . .,l2£I-), of

which each element is defined as

where j : 1,. . .,n and x : 1,. . ., 2/. We can derive a recurrence rela—
tion to iteratively update the vector h] from the vector h]_1 (rescaled
SAF likelihood for j — 1 individuals) as follows:

Because the constant 2i(2}_1) in Equation (5) is cancelled out during

 

standardization, we can use the following recurrence equation to up—
date the rescaled SAF likelihood:

h; 2 (21' — x)(2/' — x — 1>Ll<o>hr1 + 2x(2/ — x)L;-(1)bi__11
+ x(x — 1)L,-(2)l/"_1,. (6)

forx : 1,...,2/'.

Figure 2B shows how the SAF likelihood is recurrently updated
from h1 to h‘1 by the rescaled DP algorithm in a lower triangular ma—
trix (Figure 2B, top) and the final SAF likelihood h (Figure 2B, bot—
tom). Now, all values in the SAF likelihood hi range between 0
and1, suggesting there will be no potential numerical overﬂow.
Importantly, we observed that the most of the cells in the SAF likeli—
hood during update have a value close to 0 (shown in gray). This
implies that computing all values of the SAF likelihood is inefficient
and we can accurately approximate this vector by only computing
the first few elements and setting the rest of the elements to 0. This
motivated the development of the banded and score—limited DP
algorithm.

2.3 Banded and score—limited DP algorithm
We observed that all non—negligible values of the updated rescaled
SAF likelihoods, h1 to h“, are consistently concentrated on the
best—guess allele counts (Figure 2 for the allele frequency of 0 and
Figure 3 for the allele frequency of 0.7). For example, for a site that
is fixed for the ancestral allele, we observe that all non—negligible
values of the rescaled SAF likelihoods are consistently observed on
the first few cells of the vector, and the final SAF likelihood h has a
peak at the allele frequency of 0 (Fig. 2B). For a site that is poly—
morphic, we observe that the mode of the SAF likelihood typically
stays at 0 when we add an individual whose best—guess genotype is
0/0 (i.e. the genotype likelihood vector of that individual has the
highest value at genotype 0/0), whereas the mode typically moves to
the right when we add an individual whose best—guess genotype is 0/
1 or 1/1 (Fig. 3B). If we add an individual whose best—guess genotype
is 0/1, the mode tends to move one bin to the right and the best—
guess allele count increases by 1. By the same token, if we add an in—
dividual whose best—guess genotype is 1/1, the mode moves two bins
to the right and the best—guess allele count increases by two.

Based on these observations, we propose a new algorithm, called
a banded DP algorithm, which can compute the SAF likelihood in a

Fig. 3. Updating the SAF likelihood for 50 diploid individuals by the original
DP (A, referred to as Original), the rescaled DP (B, referred to as Rescaled),
the banded DP (C, referred to as Banded) and the score-limited DP (D, referred
to as score-limited) algorithm. The sequencing data were simulated at cover-
age 3>< with error rate of 0.001. A random site with the true derived allele fre-
quency of 0.7 is chosen. Each row in the lower triangular matrix represents
the intermediate SAF likelihood for 1' individuals. The gray area represents the
range of values computed by all four algorithms. Note that for the original DP
algorithm, we standardized each row of the lower triangular matrix such that
the maximum elements are assigned to one to compare with other three
algorithms

more efficient manner than the original DP algorithm, but with
good approximation to the SAF likelihood computed by the original
DP algorithm (Fig. 3C). When updating the SAF likelihood (i.e. fill—
ing in each row of the lower triangular matrix), this algorithm finds
the most likely position for the mode, and only updates values of the
SAF likelihood d bins away from that position in both directions
and sets the rest of the values zero. Here d represents a user defined
bandwidth.

Let GC,- denote the number of derived allele in the best—guess
genotype for individual / (GC,- 6 {0, 1,2}) and AC,- the best—guess al—
lele count for / individuals. For each row of the lower triangular ma—
trix, the banded DP algorithm computes the number of derived
allele in the best—guess genotype (GCi) based on the genotype likeli—
hoods of a given individual, and then updates the best—guess allele
count (ACi) using the best—guess genotype:

AC," 2 ACi_1+ GCI',

where AC 6 [0, 2i]. Next, it computes the values of the SAF likeli—
hood only within d bins away from the best—guess allele count (ACi)
in both directions and outside of which it sets the values of the
SAF likelihood to zero—i.e. h; is computed by Equation (5) if
max (0,AC,- — d)£x£min (AC,- + d, 2/) and otherwise h; : 0. By
doing so, the SAF likelihood is updated in a banded—fashion (com—
puting at most 2d + 1 values at each updating step, where d is a uni—
form bandwidth) rather than updated in a triangular fashion
(computing 3 + 5 + - - - + (2n + 1) values). This makes computation
time close to O(dn) rather than the original O(n2).

Our algorithm has connections with existing banded DP algo—
rithms (for example, banded Needleman—Wunsch alignment algo—
rithm and banded Smith—Waterman alignment algorithm) (Sung,
2009). The banded DP algorithm fills in only the middle part of the
DP matrix in a banded fashion (with band length of 2d + 1), and
does not compute the lower and upper triangles in the matrix.
However, unlike existing banded DP algorithms, we need to repeat
the same process across all sites and we realized that using the uni—
form value of band length d across all site does not work in practice
due to site—to—site variability of the SAF likelihood (see Fig. 4B).
Moreover, around the best—guess allele count, the number of values
we need to compute is not usually symmetric in the left and right
sides, implying that using the same band length for both sides is not
efficient. Therefore, we propose another new algorithm, called a
score-limited DP algorithm. This algorithm is different from the

Fig. 4. Performance of the three algorithms (Rescaled, Banded and Score-lim-
ited) for updating the SAF likelihood with simulated sequencing data (A) and
real data (B). (A) It shows how the SAF likelihood is updated for 50 individuals
as a function of sequencing coverage in simulated sequencing data. The
sequencing data were simulated at coverage 3>< (top), 5>< (middle) and 10x
(bottom) with error rate of 0.001, and a site with the true allele frequency of
0.51 is randomly picked. Each row of the lower triangular matrix represents
the SAF likelihood vector for 1' individuals, and the gray area represents the
range of values computed by each algorithm. The final SAF likelihood h by all
three algorithms is shown in black (Rescaled), blue (Banded), and red (Score-
limited). Note that all three distributions almost completely overlap, and the
mean and variance are the same for all three distributions. (B) It shows how
the SAF likelihood is updated for 50 GBR individuals in the 1000 Genome
Project at two random sites with the same best-guess allele frequency of 0.5.
Two sites (top for position 10 085 321 and bottom for position 10 012 499 in
chromosome 10) have the different variance of the SAF likelihood

banded DP algorithm in a way that the number of cells to be com—
puted at each updating step is adaptively changed rather than being
kept at a uniform band length (2d + 1).

Our score—limited DP algorithm also starts from computing the
number of derived allele in the best—guess genotype based on the
genotype likelihoods of a given individual. Then, it proposes left and
right boundaries within which we update values of the SAF likeli—
hood. Let L,- and R,- denote the left and right boundaries, respect—
ively, within which we update the SAF likelihood for / individuals
(h,). It updates the left and right boundaries using the best—guess

genotype:
Li I Li_1+  and R,‘ I R,"_1+ 

For example, for the individuals whose best—guess genotype is 0/0
we do not change the boundaries (L,- : Li_1,R,- : Ri_1). For individ—
uals whose best—guess genotype is 0/1 we move both boundaries
one bin to the right (L,- : Li_1 + 1,R,- : Ri_1 + 1), and for the

individuals whose best—guess genotype is 1/1 we move both bounda—
ries two bins to the right (L,- : Li_1 + 2, R,- : Ri_1 + 2).

Next, it checks whether a value at the left boundary (hiLi) is
greater than a very small value 6 (for example, we set e : 10‘9) and
if so, it expands the appropriate boundary to the left until the value
at the updated left boundary is less than or equal to 6. By the same
token, it checks the value at the right boundary (HR!) and if the value
is greater than 6, then it expands the right boundary to the right until
the value at the updated right boundary is less than or equal to 6.
Finally, it computes the values of the SAF likelihood only within the
left and right boundaries and outside of which we set the values of
the SAF likelihood to zero—i.e. h; is computed by Equation (5) if
max (0, Li) 3 x g min(L,-, 2i) and otherwise h; : 0. By doing this at
each step of calculating the SAF likelihood, it only computes R,- — L,-
+1 number of elements, which is dynamically changing at each
updating step, but always much smaller than 2/ + 1. We present the
pseudo—code for the score—limited DP algorithm in the
Supplementary Appendix.

This revised algorithm has connections with existing score—
limited DP algorithms. For example, in a score—limited Smith——
Waterman algorithm, the DP matrix is explored in both directions
starting from the mid—point of the hit. When the alignment score
drops off by more than 6 (a user—defined parameter), the extension is
truncated. Our adaptive algorithm is similar to this algorithm in
that it uses 6 to stop computing values of the updated SAF likeli—
hood. We found in practice that our choice of 6 (10‘9) behaves well,
but users are encouraged to test the algorithm and decide the appro—
priate value for themselves (6 is a command—line parameter of our
software). Our algorithm is, however, different in that it does not
extend from the mid—point in both directions, but it proposed the
left and right boundaries and computation is done from right to left.
This is required because in real implementation, the updated SAF
likelihood for /' individuals stored in the same vector for the SAF
likelihood for j — 1 individuals and in order to properly update val—
ues, computation should be done from right to left.

Figure 3 shows with an example how that the score—limited DP
algorithm captures the important regions of the SAF likelihood.
Hence, the score—limited DP algorithm is faster than the original DP
algorithm, as reﬂected by the reduced computation area (shown in
gray in Fig. 3). Moreover, we retain the accuracy of the final SAF
likelihood h with the score—limited DP algorithm and it is as stable
as the rescaled DP algorithm. The shape of the distribution h is iden—
tical in all four cases (original, rescaled, banded and score—limited),
reﬂected by the same mean and variance of h in all four cases
(Fig.3).

3 Methods

3.1 Generating simulated sequences

To compare the four algorithms (original, rescaled, banded and
score—limited DP algorithm) for computing SAF likelihoods, we gen—
erated aligned short—read sequencing data by changing sequencing
coverage (3 X, 5>< and 10><) and sample size (50, 100, 300, 500 and
1000 diploid individuals). For this purpose, we first conducted
population genetic simulations to produce haplotype data of a given
sample size assuming the standard model (with an effective popula—
tion size of 10 000 diploid individuals, a mutation rate per—base
per—generation of 2.5 X 10‘8 and a recombination rate of 10‘s), and
then overlaid sequencing errors (with error rate of 0.001) to gener—
ate paired—end short—read sequencing data given sequencing cover—
age. For detailed descriptions of the coalescent and sequencing

simulations, refer Material and Methods section in Han et al.
(2014).

3.2 Sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project

To demonstrate the score—limited DP algorithm’s utility with real
data, we downloaded the VCF file and the BAM files from the 1000
Genomes Project FTP site in order to estimate the SFS. We used the
genotype calls of 365 European and 228 sub—Saharan African indi—
viduals from the VCF file, which contains the genotype calls for
1092 individuals sampled from 14 populations drawn from Europe,
East Asia, sub—Saharan Africa and the Americas (1000 Genomes
Project Consortium, 2010, 2012). For the BAM files, we only used
low—coverage Illumina sequencing data (coverage 2>< to 4><) (1000
Genomes Project Consortium, 2010, 2012) for these same individ—
uals. Due to file size constraints, we downloaded only a subsection
of the genome (region of 10—20 Mb in chromosome 10) by using
SAMtools (version 0.1.18) (Li et al., 2009).

3.3 Estimating the SFS

To infer the SFS from simulated aligned short—read sequencing data,
we used the direct estimation approach using the freely available
program ANGSD (version 0.588) with the EM algorithm option to
obtain the MLE of the SFS (Nelson et al., 2012). We refer to results
of this procedure as Original. Then, we modified the source code of
ANGSD to implement the rescaled DP and the score—limited DP
algorithm. All code is written in C++.

For the 1000 Genomes Project data, we evaluated two
approaches to infer the SFS: the call—based and direct estimation
approaches. For the call—based estimation approach, we used geno—
type calls in the VCF file and then reconstructed the SFS by allele
counting using vchools (version 0.1.10) (Danecek et al., 2011). For
the direct estimation approach, we directly estimated the SFS from
the BAM files with the score—limited DP algorithm.

To evaluate the accuracy of the SFS estimated from simulated
short—read sequencing data, we computed the relative deviation of
the inferred SFS (computed from sequencing data) compared with
the ground—truth SFS (computed from the known values for the
genotype data) in each derived allele frequency bin i / (27;):

Relative deviation : M ,
2” ftrue 

where fseq  represents a fraction of sites with a derived allele
frequency i/(2n) in the inferred SF5 and ftme  represents a frac—

tion of sites with a derived allele frequency i/(2n) in the ground—
truth SFS.

4 Results

We evaluated whether the score—limited DP algorithm is robust to
different sequencing coverage and the variance in the site likelihood
vector. This evaluation is important because one of the characteris—
tics of the next—generation sequencing data is highly variable cover—
age across sites that affect the variance of the genotype likelihood
vector at the individual—level and the variance of the site likelihood
vector at the sample—level.

4.1 Performance for changing sequencing coverage

First, we investigated the impact of different sequencing coverage on
the performance of the score—limited DP algorithm in computing the
SAF likelihood. For this purpose, we simulated sequencing data for

50 diploid individuals under the standard model at coverage 3 X , 5 X
and 10><. Figure 4A shows how the SAF likelihood is updated at a
random site with true allele frequency of 0.51 as a function of
sequencing coverage. We observed that the SAF likelihood h is more
diffuse as coverage decreases, whereas it is more peaked around the
true allele frequency of 0.51 as coverage increases (Fig. 4A, the
variance of the SAF likelihood h is 7.2 with 3><, 2.3 with 5>< and
0.21 with 10>< ). This is because the genotype likelihood vectors tend
to be more spread out at low coverage, whereas they tend to be
more peaked at the unknown individual genotype at high coverage.
This implies that if the banded DP algorithm is used, the choice of
bandwidth should depend on coverage—the higher coverage, the
smaller d. With this simulated data, we used d of 15 for 3><, 10 for
5>< and 5 for 10><, and this worked well for all sites (Fig. 4A,
Banded). However, this requires for users to calibrate an appropri—
ate bandwidth before using the algorithm. This difficulty of choos—
ing the appropriate bandwidth is solved with the score—limited DP
algorithm. We observed that the optimal bandwidth is adaptively
chosen at each updating step (each row of the lower triangular ma—
trix) with the score—limited DP algorithm, and this resulted in a
more tight computation area to approximate the SAF likelihood
compared with that with the banded DP algorithm. Furthermore,
the resulting SAF likelihood has a comparable accuracy to the SAF
likelihood computed by the rescaled DP algorithm across all cover—
age (Fig. 4A). The shape of the distribution h is the same, with the
same mean and standard deviation of h, for all three algorithms
across coverage.

4.2 Performance for variation in the site likelihood
vector

Next, we evaluated that whether the score—limited DP algorithm
works well with real data. For this purpose, we used low—coverage
sequencing data for 50 diploid GBR individuals in the 1000
Genome Project, and then compared the SAF likelihood computed
by the three algorithms (rescaled, banded and score—limited) at mul—
tiple random sites with the same best—guess allele frequency in the
sample. Compared with the simulated sequencing data matched at
average coverage (5 X), we observed that low—coverage sequencing
data in the 1000 Genomes Project tend to have bigger site—to—site
variation of the SAF likelihood. Figure 4B shows how the SAF likeli—
hood h is updated at two random sites with the best—guess allele fre—
quency of 0.5 in the sample. We observed that the first site (position
10 012 499 in chromosome 10) has a bigger variance in the SAF
likelihood than the second site (position 10 085 321 in chromosome
10)—the variance of the SAF likelihood at the first site is 12,
whereas that at the second site is 1.4 (Fig. 4B). Due to large differ—
ences in the variability of the SAF likelihoods, the banded DP
algorithm with the uniform bandwidth (d : 10) performs badly for
the first site but performs well for the second site. However, unlike
the banded DP algorithm, the score—limited DP algorithm performs
well for both sites, because it is capable of changing the bandwidth
accordingly to the observed variance of the SAF likelihood at differ—
ent sites—the larger the variance of the SAF likelihood, the larger
the bandwidth. Moreover, the resulting SAF likelihood computed by
the score—limited DP algorithm has a comparable accuracy to that
computed by the rescaled DP algorithm—same shape, and the mean
and standard deviation with the three algorithms (Fig. 4B)

4.3 Evaluating the accuracy of the inferred SFS
We evaluate the accuracy of the inferred SFS by the score—limited DP
algorithm (score—limited) compared with the inferred SFS using the

original DP (original). For this comparison, we simulated 100 repli—
cates of sequencing data for 100, 300 and 500 diploid individuals
each from genomic regions of length 100 Kb under the standard
model. The accuracy of the inferred SFS was evaluated by two
metrics: (i) the shape of the inferred SFS in comparison to the
ground—truth SFS (Fig. 5A) and (ii) the relative deviation of the
inferred SFS compared with the ground—truth SFS at each allele fre—
quency bin (Fig. 5B).

We found that the score—limited DP algorithm behaves equiva—
lently to the original DP algorithm. We observed the identical shape
of the inferred SFS (Fig. 5) with both algorithms. Moreover, consist—
ent with our previous study (Han et al., 2014), both algorithms led
to unbiased estimates of the SFS even at low coverage (such as 3><)
regardless of sample size. The shape of the inferred SFS was similar
to the ground—truth SFS (Fig. 5A) and the relative deviation of the
inferred SFS was close to 0 in all allele frequency bins (Fig. 5B)
across all sequencing coverage.

4.4 Runtime comparisons

We next evaluated the runtime for computing site likelihood vectors
by the score—limited DP algorithm (score—limited) compared with the
runtime by the original DP algorithm (original). We observed
runtime speed—ups with the score—limited DP algorithm compared
with the original DP algorithm for all sample sizes we tested (Fig. 1 ).
For example, on average, with 500 individuals we observed 5.3—fold
speed—up, and with 1000 individuals we observed 8.4—fold speed
up. Moreover, consistent with our expectation, the runtime of the
original DP algorithm increases quadratically with sample size,
whereas the runtime of the score—limited DP algorithm has a linear
fit (Fig. 1). These results imply that as a sample size increases, we
will observe even more dramatic differences in the runtimes of the
two algorithms. For example, when we extrapolated runtime from
the results with 7131000, we expect 17.5—fold speed—up with 2500
individuals and 63—fold speed—up with 10 000 individuals. The speed
improvement with the score—limited DP algorithm will greatly facili—
tate direct inference of the SFS even when the number of individuals
is large.

We want to emphasize that the runtime in Figure 1 is per 10 Mb
region, and for the whole genome the runtime would be greater by a
factor of 300. However, computational efficiency can be further im—
proved by distributing SAF likelihood computation across nodes.
Another possibility is sub—sampling random sites across the genome
and distributing the SAF likelihood computation across nodes based
on only those sub—sampled sites.

We also note that the score—limited DP algorithm will have less
memory usage than the original DP algorithm, which requires mem—
ory on the order of n to store the SAF likelihood. With the score—lim—
ited DP algorithm, the memory needed is to store the Ru — L, + 1
elements of the vector, and we expect that number to stay nearly
constant or to scale upwards slowly in proportion to n. In our imple—
mentation, when writing the output of the SAF likelihood to a file,
at each site, we only output non—zero values of the SAF likelihood,
the left boundary (Ln), and the number of non—zero values
(Rn — L, + 1), rather than outputting all 271 + 1 values. This vastly
saves file size to store SAF likelihoods across all sites, and requires
less memory to read in the SAF likelihood file to subsequently run
an EM algorithm or a BFGS algorithm. For example, for simulated
sequencing data of 500 individuals at 5 X, the size of the SAF likeli—
hood file is 764 Mb with the original DP algorithm, whereas that
with the score—limited DP algorithm is 8.9 Mb. For simulated
sequencing data of 1000 individuals at 5><, the file size with the

4.5 Application to the low—coverage 1000 Genomes
Project sequencing data

Finally, we compared the SFS inferred by the call—based approach
with the SFS inferred by the direct estimation approach using our
score—limited DP algorithm. We used 365 European (EUR) individ—
uals and 228 sub—Saharan African (AFR) individuals to infer the
SFS. For the call—based estimation approach, we used the genotype
calls stored in the VCF file and then estimated the SFS by allele
counting. Note that the VCF file is generated by an LD—aware multi—
sample genotype calling pipeline (1000 Genomes Project
Consortium, 2012). For the direct estimation approach, we inferred
the SFS directly from low coverage short—read sequencing data
(stored in the BAM files, coverage 2><—4><) using our score—limited
DP algorithm.

First, we constructed the SFS for 365 EUR individuals with either
the call—based approach or the direct estimation method. We
observed a striking lack of singletons in the call—based SFS compared
with the directly estimated SFS (Fig. 6A and B). The proportion of
singletons in the inferred SFS by the VCF file is 0.21 and that by the
BAM files is 0.38 (Fig. 6A), showing that 82% less singletons are
inferred in the 1000 Genomes genotype call sets (Fig. 6B). This is
consistent with our previous study (Han et al., 2014) that shows
multisample callers lead to underestimation of rare variants, because
a small number of correct alternate reads tend to be ignored.
Consistent with this, we observed more positive Tajima’s D for the
call—based SFS compared with the directly estimated SFS (Fig. 6C).
Moreover, we observed an excess of sites fixed for an ancestral allele
in the called—based SFS, implying that there might be more poly—
morphic sites in the genetic region we analysed than the reported

Next, we inferred the SFS for 228 AFR individuals and a com—

based approach or the direct estimation approach. We observed a
similar pattern as with the European population, implying that our
results apply to all samples in the 1000 Genomes Project (data not
shown).

5 Discussion

A large sample size enables us to infer more precise summary statis—
tics and parameters in many population genetic analyses. However,
at the same time, we confront computational challenges with large
samples and in many cases, we have to deal with these challenges to
make the method practical with large sample sizes. We showed that
although the direct estimation approach for computing the SFS can
provide the unbiased SFS even at low coverage, it does not scale up
to large sample sizes because the computation time for running this
method is quadratic in a number of diploid individuals. To over—
come this problem, we developed a new algorithm, called the score—
limited DP algorithm, and showed that the computation time for
running this algorithm is linear in the number of genomes. This algo—
rithm exploits the observation that for most sites the SAF likeli—
hood’s non—negligible values are all concentrated on a few elements
around the element corresponding to the best—guess allele count.
Therefore, we approximate this vector by curtailing computation to
only a few components of the DP update vectors. More importantly,

this algorithm can adaptively choose the bandwidth d during updat—
ing the SAF likelihood for each site. We showed that the bandwidth
change is robust to sequencing coverage and the variation of the
SAF likelihood. We also showed that the EM combined this new al—
gorithm has comparable accuracy but is 8—fold faster than the ori—
ginal DP combined with the EM algorithm when analysing the data
from 1000 individuals. Our new algorithm’s improvement in speed
makes it possible to directly estimate the SFS from very large sam—
ples of low coverage short—read sequencing data.

Our score—limited DP algorithm could be applied to other DP al—
gorithm whose runtime is quadratic in a sample size. For example,
Yi et al. (2010) proposed an empirical Bayes approach to estimate a
posterior probability of a minor allele frequency (MAF). They used
a DP algorithm to effectively compute summation over all possible
genotype configurations for n diploid individuals, and therefore this
algorithm has a runtime complexity of C(nz) similar to the DP algo—
rithm introduced here. Furthermore, similar to the distribution of
the SAF likelihood, the distribution of the posterior probabilities of
the MAF is unimodal and most of the probabilities are close to 0.
Therefore, we can apply our score—limited DP algorithm for this DP
algorithm to reduce runtime complexitiy to be O(dn) rather than
original O(n2) where d is the maximum bandwidth.

Our score—limited DP algorithm can also be directly applied to
speed up estimation of the 2D SFS. Li (2011) derived the EM algo—
rithm to get the MLE of the 2D SFS as an extension to the 1D SFS
estimation, and this requires precomputation of the SAF likelihoods
for all sites for each population independently. This implies that we
can make this method faster with the score—limited DP algorithm
compared with the original DP algorithm. The computation time for
running the original algorithm is 0(n1 + nﬁ), whereas the runtime
of the score—limited DP algorithm becomes O(d1n1 + dznz), where
n1, n2 represent a sample size for each population and d1, d2 are the
maximum bandwidth.

One might argue that uncertainty associated with genotype calls
can be overcome by simply increasing sequencing coverage and there
is therefore little need for algorithms that handle low coverage data.
However, cost constraints require difficult choices between increas—
ing sample size and increasing coverage. There are certain cases
where one prefers a large sample of low—coverage sequencing data
over a smaller sample size with high coverage. For example, in gen—
ome—wide association studies, one can obtain more power by
sequencing a large number of individuals at low coverage (Kim et
al., 2010; Pasaniuc et al., 2012). As another example, identification
of rare variants always requires large sample sizes, and moderately
rare loci will be detectable even with low coverage data. Finally,
even though sequencing cost keeps dropping, cost constraints
will not disappear because users will continue to work with limited
budgets and push these limits with applications involving very
large numbers of individuals; thus we expect low—coverage sequenc—
ing will remain an attractive approach for many investigators and
that methods like ours will retain their appeal for the foreseeable
future.

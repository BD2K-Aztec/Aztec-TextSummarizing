ABSTRACT

Summary: Figures in biomedical articles present visual evidence
for research facts and help readers understand the article better.
However, when figures are taken out of context, it is difficult to
understand their content. We developed a summarization algorithm
to summarize the content of figures and used it in our figure search
engine (http://figuresearch.askhermes.org/). In this article, we report
on the development of web browser extensions for Mozilla Firefox,
Google Chrome and Apple Safari to display summaries for figures in
PubMed Central and NCBI Images.

Availability: The extensions can be downloaded from http://
figuresearch.askhermes.org/articlesearch/extensions.php.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biomedical scientists need to access ﬁgures to validate research
facts and to formulate or test novel research hypotheses. However,
ﬁgures are difﬁcult to comprehend without associated text
(e.g. ﬁgure legend and other reference text). Our evaluation has
shown statistically signiﬁcant differences in ﬁgure comprehension
when varying levels of text were provided (Yu et al., 2009).
When the ﬁill-text article is not available, presenting just the
ﬁgure+legend left biomedical researchers lacking 39—68% of
the information about a ﬁgure as compared to having complete
ﬁgure comprehension; adding the title and abstract improved
the situation, but still left biomedical researchers missing 30%
of the information. When the full-text article is available, ﬁgure
comprehension increased to the highest 86—97% (Yu et al., 2009).
The results indicate that there is information in the abstract and
in the ﬁill-text that biomedical scientists require to understand the
ﬁgures that appear in biomedical articles (Yu et al., 2009). On
the other hand, we also found that the associated text of a ﬁgure
is typically distributed across the ﬁill-text body and is frequently
redundant in content (Yu, 2006). For example, the following three
redundant sentences in the abstract, introduction, and caption
describe an image (Figure l) of the article (Das et al., 2003):

Abstract: PTEN is composed of an N-terminal phosphatase
domain, a C2 domain, and a C-terminal tail region that contains

the PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-I homology (PDZ) domain-binding sequence
and multiple phosphorylation sites.

Introduction: PTEN is composed of the N-terminal phosphatase
domain (8 180 aa), the C2 domain (8 165 aa), and the C-terminal
tail (8 50 aa) (see Fig. I).

Figure Caption: PTEN has a N-terminal phosphatase domain,
a C2 domain, and a C-terminal tail that contains multiple
phosphorylation sites and a PDZ domain-binding sequence.

We hypothesize that a succinct and structured summary will
allow biomedical researchers to comprehend the ﬁgure data
efﬁciently and to access relevant ﬁgures in a timely manner.
Figure summaries may beneﬁt other text-mining tasks, including
information extraction, retrieval and question answering. For
example, information extraction systems may target fewer and more
succinct statements. Information retrieval and question answering
can beneﬁt by removing redundant information.

We developed methods (Agarwal and Yu, 2009a, b; Yu et al.,
2009) to automatically aggregate distributed associated text, remove
redundant information and generate a text summary for each ﬁgure.
We ﬁrst found that biomedical researchers prefer a structured
summary that follows the IMRaD format (Introduction, Methods,
Results and Discussion) (Yu et al., 2009). We developed a supervised
machine learning classiﬁer to automatically classify sentences
appearing in a ﬁill-text biomedical articles into the IMRaD format
with an Fl-score of 91.55% (Agarwal and Yu, 2009a). We then
developed a simple information retrieval approach that selects one
sentence from each of the IMRaD categories based on cosine
similarity between the sentence and the image caption (Agarwal and
Yu, 2009b). We generated a manual gold-standard for 44 ﬁgures
in 7 articles by asking annotators to select sentences from the
article that best summarize the ﬁgure. We then evaluated our ﬁgure
summarizer using the ROUGE score (recall-oriented understudy for
gisting evaluation) (Lin, 2004) and obtained an average ROUGE-l
score of 0.70. In comparison, the abstract of the article attained
a ROUGE-l score of 0.33. In the future, we plan to conduct
a cognitive evaluation as we have done in (Yu et al., 2009) to
evaluate how automatically generated ﬁgure summaries improve
ﬁgure comprehension. We implemented the ﬁgure summarization
system with over 200 000 ﬁill-text biomedical articles deposited in
PubMed Central’s Open Access Subset as an online system called
‘ﬁguresearch’ (http://ﬁguresearch.askhermes.org). We conducted an
online survey with 24 participants, and 65.2% survey participants
found that the summaries are useﬁil for ﬁgure comprehension.

In October 2010, the National Library of Medicine (NLM)
announced that PubMed Abstract display for PubMed Central®
articles are enhanced to include an image strip generated from

the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) image
database (Canese, 2010), which incorporates 3 million ﬁgures
(accessed November 6, 2010). In this study, we developed browser
extensions to enrich the ﬁgure with ﬁgure summary.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

We implemented ﬁgure summarization program into extensions
for the following web browsers: Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome
and Apple Safari (extensions available from: http://ﬁguresearch
.askhermes.org/articlesearch/extensions.php). The extensions are
written in JavaScript and implemented using Ajax. The summaries
have already been generated and are stored on our servers. When the

user loads a ﬁgure on PubMed Central, the extension makes a call
to our server with the article’s PubMed Central ID and the ﬁgure’s
ID. If the summary for the ﬁgure is available, our server sends it
to the extension. The extension then injects HTML code under the
caption to display the summary (Figure 1). As the summaries have
been preprocessed, no time is spent on generating the summaries.
We use Ajax to obtain and display the summary as this allows the
ﬁgure page to load even if the summary is unavailable or while the
summary is obtained from the server. As the extension is based on
JavaScript, we have also made it available as a Greasemonkey user
script (http://userscripts.org/scripts/shOW/90065).

The web browser extensions we developed insert a summary for
the ﬁgure under the caption of the ﬁgure (Figure 1). The summary is
retrieved from ﬁguresearch’s servers by the extensions using Ajax. If
an article is not open-access or has not been processed and stored in
ﬁguresearch’s servers, then the ﬁgure is displayed as it would have
been without the extension. We believe that use of this extension
will allow biomedical researchers to access ﬁgure summaries in their
traditional workﬂow, which involves use of PubMed Central.

2.1 Limitations

As only the open-access subset of PubMed Central is freely available
for download, ﬁguresearch includes summaries for ﬁgures from
these open-access articles only. As a result, summaries are displayed
for ﬁgures from open-access articles only.

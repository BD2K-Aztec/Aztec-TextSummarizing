ABSTRACT

Motivation: In the drug discovery field, new uses for old drugs,
selective optimization of side activities and fragment-based drug
design (FBDD) have proved to be successful alternatives to high-
throughput screening. e-Drug3D is a database of 3D chemical
structures of drugs that provides several collections of ready-to-
screen SD files of drugs and commercial drug fragments. They are
natural inputs in studies dedicated to drug repurposing and FBDD.
Availability: e-Drug3D collections are freely available at
http://chemoinfo.ipmc.cnrs.fr/e-drung.html either for download or
for direct in silico web-based screenings.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Approved drugs represent very attractive and valuable starting point
for drug discovery. Studies of drugs entering the market show that
most of their drug progenitors (or lead structures) were known
drugs or Clinical candidates (Proudfoot, 2002; Teague, 2011). The
rationale is that a drug usually acts on more than one target and may
exhibit previously unknown functions due to promiscuous off-target
interactions explaining efﬁcacy and/or side-effects (Campillos et (11.,
2008). Examples of new therapeutic indications for old drugs include
the anti-emetic and hypnotic Thalidomide originally withdrawn
as a leprostatic agent (Teo et (11., 2005) or the anti-neoplastic
Finasteride for the treatment of hair loss (approved in 1997). Over
the years, an increasing number of pharmaceutical companies have
been interested in ‘drug repurposing’ in order to reduce the risk
and cost of the development of new chemical entities (Tobinick,
2009). The fragment-based drug design (FBDD) approach represents
another validated alternative to high-throughput screening (Murray
and Blundell, 2010). It consists of identifying low molecular weight
molecules that are able to interact with a deﬁned binding site.
Hits are then combined or grown into high-afﬁnity ligands. Over
the past decade, FBDD has become established as an effective
approach and has led to the discovery of high-afﬁnity bioactive
molecules, some of which are in Clinical development. The ‘rule
of three’ provides a useful guideline when designing the fragment

screening collection (Congreve et (11., 2003), but the selection criteria
may also include ‘privileged structures’ that are commonly found
in known drug molecules (Hartshorn et (11., 2005; Lepre, 2001).
This strategy is based on the assumption that molecules resembling
existing drugs are more likely to possess appropriate ADMET
properties than random molecules. e-Drug3D has been purposely
designed to provide free and ready-to-screen virtual collections of
approved drugs and of their commercially available substructures
(fragments). These collections of compounds are natural inputs for
various cheminformatic and virtual screening applications.

2 e-DRUG3D COLLECTIONS

e-Drug3D is an annotated database based on the ‘Drugs@FDA
Data File’ released by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). Over the years, several publicly available and drug-speciﬁc
databases have emerged including DrugBank (Knox et (11., 2011),
ChEMBL/Drugs (Gaulton et (11., 2012) and SuperDrug (Goede
et (11., 2005). SuperDrug was the ﬁrst free resource that provided
3D conformers of drug structures. In developing e-Drug3D, our
objective was to further expand such computed drug structures
by adding recent approved drugs and providing a collection
of commercially available drug fragments. e-Drug3D currently
contains 1519 annotated 3D structures of 1305 different FDA-
approved drugs of molecular weight <2000 (last update: June
2011). Chiral centers are checked and enantiomers are differentiated.
We also provide two supplementary collections resulting from
(i) the calculation of the most probable tautomeric and ionic states
at pH 7.4 and (ii) the generation of multiple conformations for
ring systems. Finally, we produced a collection of commercial
substructures of drugs. The current collection contains 1383
commercial fragments that are represented by a single conformation.
Preparation, analyses and comparisons of the two collections are
given in the Supplementary Material. The e-Drug3D database is
accessible through our web interface for browsing. It can be queried
by keyword search, structural criteria or similarity search. Tools are
also provided to select subsets of drugs for comparisons. Drug and
fragment collections are directly linked to the in silico screening
web server e-LEA3D (Douguet, 2010).

3 A FBDD EXAMPLE

The FBDD approach was successﬁilly used to identify novel
inhibitors of human cyclophilins. These proteins are enzymes
exhibiting a peptidyl-prolyl Cis—trans isomerase activity and playing

a role in immunity and viral infection, including Hepatitis C virus
(HCV: Guichou et al., 2011: Watashi, 2010). Several fragments

were selected by virtual screening and soaked with cyclophilin
D crystals (Schlatter et al., 2005). Among them, the compound
1-formylpiperazine corresponds to one fragment of our drug
collection that is a substructure of the drugs DelaVirdine, Doxazosin,
Prazosin and Terazosin. Figure 1 shows the structure of the human
cyclophilin D with this fragment (PDB ID 3RCK). Chemical
optimization of several co-crystallized hit fragments led to the
identiﬁcation of submicromolar inhibitors of cyclophilin A, B
and D (Guichou et al., 2011). These molecules show similar
inhibition in infectious models and no cytotoxicity at the effective
concentrations. The discovery of non-peptidic cyclophilin inhibitors
is a breakthrough in the ongoing search for new anti-HCV agents as
well as a successful example of the application of FBDD to difﬁcult
targets.

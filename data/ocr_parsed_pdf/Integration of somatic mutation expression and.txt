Abstract

Motivation: Genome and transcriptome analyses can be used to explore cancers comprehensively,
and it is increasingly common to have multiple omics data measured from each individual.
Furthermore, there are rich functional data such as predicted impact of mutations on protein
coding and gene/protein networks. However, integration of the complex information across the dif—
ferent omics and functional data is still challenging. Clinical validation, particularly based on patient
outcomes such as survival, is important for assessing the relevance of the integrated information
and for comparing different procedures.

Results: An analysis pipeline is built for integrating genomic and transcriptomic alterations from
whole—exome and RNA sequence data and functional data from protein function prediction and
gene interaction networks. The method accumulates evidence for the functional implications of
mutated potential driver genes found within and across patients. A driver—gene score (DGscore) is
developed to capture the cumulative effect of such genes. To contribute to the score, a gene has to
be frequently mutated, with high or moderate mutational impact at protein level, exhibiting an
extreme expression and functionally linked to many differentially expressed neighbors in the func—
tional gene network. The pipeline is applied to 60 matched tumor and normal samples of the same
patient from The Cancer Genome Atlas breast—cancer project. In clinical validation, patients with
high DGscores have worse survival than those with low scores (P: 0.001). Furthermore, the
DGscore outperforms the established expression—based signatures MammaPrint and PAM50 in
predicting patient survival. In conclusion, integration of mutation, expression and functional data
allows identification of clinically relevant potential driver genes in cancer.

1 Introduction

Analysis of genome and transcriptome sequencing experiments pro—
vides a comprehensive tool for molecular studies of cancers. The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer project (Cancer
Genome Atlas Network, 2012) presents a rich dataset of whole—
exome and RNA sequence data of matched tumor and normal sam—
ples of the same patient; these allow us to accurately infer tumor—
specific alterations including somatic mutations and isoform—level
differential expression. However, it is still a challenge how to subse—
quently integrate the complex information across the different omics
data, while also exploiting the rich functional data such as protein
prediction and gene/protein interaction networks.

Most carcinomas are driven to develop by a few genetic alter—
ations, whereas the majority of the remaining genetic changes have
neutral or less deleterious effect in cancer development (Futreal
et al., 2004). To date, potential driver genes are identified largely
based on finding recurrent copy—number alteration or mutations in a
specific region across multiple samples (Akavia et al., 2010; Ciriello
et al., 2012; Lazar et al., 2013) but not on patient—specific genomic
alterations. In this article, we develop a full analysis pipeline to com—
bine DNA and RNA sequencing data together with functional data,
starting from the preprocessing of raw aligned sequencing reads, to
search for potential driver genes and eventually to summarize the
effects of these genes into a single driver—gene score (DGscore). In
addition to using existing bioinformatics tools, including GATK
(McKenna et al., 2010), Sanff (Cingolani et al., 2012) and Sequgio
(Suo et al., 2014), we suggest a novel method based on the network
enrichment analysis (NEA; Alexeyenko et al., 2012) to integrate the
genomic and transcriptomic profiles.

There is a growing literature on searching for driver genes based
on data integration. We can state at least two novel aspects in this
study: (i) isoform—level analysis: because exon lengths are not mul—
tiples of three, the potential protein—coding impact of one mutation
is different for different isoforms. Hence isoform—level assessment is
necessary. (ii) Clinical validation: we assess the clinical relevance of
the potential drivers in terms of correlation with patient outcomes
such as survival. Most current integrative methods in identifying
cancer driver genes are based on whole genes and are primarily
validated based on previously reported drivers and pathway ana—
lysis, but not clinically. Akavia et al. (2010) identified some known
drivers of melanoma, and two of the predicted drivers were demon—
strated to be critical for tumor growth with knockdown experi—
ments. Youn and Simon (2011) proposed a method that accounts
for the functional impact of mutations on protein coding, a sample
variation in background mutation rate and the redundancy of the
genetic code. They analyzed a dataset of non—small cell lung tumors
to show that the identified driver genes were also deemed important
previously.

Ciriello et al. (2012) developed the so—called MEMo algorithm
and showed that it was able to recapitulate previously identified
pathways in glioblastoma and ovarian cancer. Potential driver genes
were used for histological subtyping in lung cancer (Lazar et al.,
2013) or to reveal intrinsic subtype—specific mutations in breast can—
cer (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012). CAERUS focuses on in—
vestigation of biological network disruptions linked to cancer
outcomes at the protein domain level, but it does not take into ac—
count the impact of mutations on RNA expression and protein cod—
ing (Zhang and Ouellette, 2011). DawnRank, a recently published
algorithm, directly prioritizes altered genes on a single—patient scope
regardless of mutation frequency (Hou and Ma, 2014). DawnRank
requires information of a gene interaction network, somatic

genomic alterations and the differential gene expression profile, but
it does not consider the predicted biological impact of a mutation on
protein. Helios incorporates somatic copy number alterations, point
mutations, gene expression and RNAi screens to pinpoint driver
genes with large recurrently amplified regions of DNA (Sanchez—
Garcia et al., 2014). In summary, these methods do not utilize iso—
form—level information and the potential drivers are generally not
validated in terms of patients’ clinical outcomes such as survival.

As genetic instability caused by mutations in multiple critical
genes may be central to tumor progression (Loeb and Loeb, 2000;
Salomon et al., 2013), we summarize the effects of potential driver
genes into a single value DGscore and assess its clinical value as
prognostic biomarker. In our analysis of the TCGA breast cancer
data, there is a strong evidence that patients carrying more mutated
genes with functional implications and extreme expression pattern
have worse survival rates than those with less mutated potential
driver genes. Over the last decade, a number of studies have de—
veloped gene signatures for prognostic classification of breast can—
cer. Among the most well known, Mammaprint (van ’t Veer et al.,
2002) captures the expression profile of 70—gene associated with
prognosis and has been shown to be a better predictor for distant
metastasis than the clinical parameters. The so—called PAM50 signa—
ture (Parker et al., 2009) classifies breast cancer into intrinsic mo—
lecular subtypes and has been shown to add significant prognostic
value. For the TCGA breast cancer data, as predictor of patient sur—
vival, the DGscore based on the potential driver genes outperforms
the 70—gene MammaPrint and the 50—gene PAM50 signatures. In
summary, integration of omics and functional data have the poten—
tial to produce clinically valuable information.

2 Patients and methods

2.1 TCGA60 paired samples

From the TCGA breast cancer project, we identified a total of 60 fe—
male patients diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma, for which
both DNA and RNA sequencing data were available, and both adja—
cent normal breast tissue and blood samples were also collected.
The age of patients at initial pathological diagnosis ranged from 31
to 90 years, with a median of 58. A majority of the patients (77%)
had infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Seven patients were stage I, 36
stage II, 14 stage III, 1 stage IV and 2 patients’ stage information
was not available. Thirty—seven patients had estrogen—receptor posi—
tive tumors. After a median follow—up of 25 months, with a range
from 0 to 147 months, 18 patients had died. Other clinical variables
and information on generating the sequencing data are summarized
in the Supplementary Material (section Patients and tissue samples,
Sequencing data processing and Supplementary Table S1). The
TCGA samples IDs that used in the analysis are provided in
Supplementary Table S2 in the Supplementary Material.

2.2 Integrative statistical analysis

An overview of the scheme to identify putative cancer drivers,
including procedures on data processing, analysis and integration, is
shown in Figure 1.

First, we use the Genome Analysis Toolkit (McKenna et al.,
2010) and PICARD (http://picard.sourceforge.net/) for refining ini—
tial reads, followed by a )8 test to assess the statistical significance
of association between allelic counts and tumor/normal (T/N) status
for somatic variant calling. To increase statistical confidence, a vari—
ant must have P—value< 0.01 to be considered further, and up to
1000 variants are allowed for each patient. This is likely to be more

mutations than expected in a tumor, but at this point, we need to
preserve sensitivity, so specificity is deliberately compromised, since
it will be improved in the subsequent filtering steps.

Non—synonymous mutation is considered more likely to have a
direct role in phenotypic change, so the Sanff is then used to pre—
dict the impact of these mutations on protein coding as ‘high’, ‘mod—
erate’ or ‘low’, based on the functional consequences of the
mutation on known genes (Cingolani et al., 2012). A high impact
mutation, for instance, leads to exon deletion, frame shift and stop
lost. Moderate impact includes non—synonymous coding, codon in—
sertion or deletion, etc. Synonymous start/stop, synonymous coding,
etc, are categorized as low impact. Isoforms mutated in at least 10
patients and predicted to have high or moderate impact in more
than two patients are kept on the list of potential drivers genes. (See
the Supplementary Material, section Selection of frequently mutated
isoforms for details.) Although extremely rare mutations may be
neglected by considering recurrently mutated genes, setting a cutoff
to filter out low frequency mutations may reduce false positive
mutation calls and highlight primary genes in tumor development.

Gene— and isoform—level expression is estimated using Sequgio
(Suo et al., 2014). A median and variance scaling is then performed
to normalize the expression on the scale of logz T/N ratio.

While most of our analysis is at isoform level, we often still have
to refer to genes. In general, if at least one isoform of a potential
driver gene meets the necessary requirement, the gene is included in
the next step of the pipeline.

The integration of mutation and expression data is done using a
network enrichment analysis (NEA) as follows. The key idea is that
the functional impact of each mutation is assessed in terms of the

 

Fig. 2. Gene network around four potential driver genes FANCA, BRCA1,
MKI67 and HEATR1 (black stars). This network contains 30 other genes (cir-
cles) connected to the potential driver genes. There is a total of 159 links,
including protein—protein interactions, metabolic and signaling links from the
functional coupling network (Alexeyenko and Sonnhammer, 2009)

number of differentially expressed (DE) neighbors in a gene net—
work. We use a comprehensive network (Alexeyenko et al., 2012)
containing approximately 1.4 millions functional interactions be—
tween 16288 HUPO genes/proteins. To be consistent with the ter—
minology used by Alexeyenko et al. (2012), each mutated gene is
referred to as a functional gene set (FGS, Fig. 1). While such a set
usually contains multiple genes, in our application each mutated
gene is assessed independently for its central functional role in mod—
ulating the expression of its interacting neighbors in the network.
Also following the NEA terminology, a collection of DE genes based
on the expression data is called the altered gene set (AGS). We com—
pute a quantitative enrichment score (z—score) as

dAF — HAP
z 2 —
SAP

7

where dAF is the number of network links between genes in the AGS
and the FGS, and rm: and CA}: are the expected mean and standard
deviation of dAF. These parameters are computed using a random—
ized network under the null hypothesis of no enrichment
(Alexeyenko et al., 2012). See also Figure 2 for an illustration of
AGS links to some mutated genes. The z—score measures the over—
representations of direct links between the AGS and the FGS, hence
the transcriptomic impact of the mutation. This in turn allows us to
prioritize the mutated genes. We only consider genes with positive 2—
value >2 as potential driver genes.

Because the underlying gene/protein interaction networks are
available only at gene level, the NEA must be done at gene level. In
setting up the AGS and FGS, we simply use the gene associated with
the isoform. If there are multiple isoforms involved, the correspond—
ing gene is set only once in the AGS or FGS.

Let us take BRCAI as an illustration of how the integrative algo—
rithm works up to this point. BRCAI has six isoforms, all of which
contain at least one point mutation with a mutation frequency of
30% across the patients. Three of the isoforms, NM_007294,
NM_007297 and NM_007300, are predicted to have a moderate
functional impact on the protein coding, thus kept in the subsequent
analysis. Hence, BRCAI gene is considered as an FGS in the NBA.

C.Suo et al.

 

Depending on the way we define the AGS, NEA can be used to
identify mutated potential driver genes that are either common
driver genes or patient—specific driver genes. For the common driv—
ers, the AGS is derived from the top 100 genes for which at least one
of their isoforms exhibit the greatest DE among all isoforms in terms
of isoform—level expression between all tumors versus the paired
normal. As stated earlier, each gene appears only once in the AGS;
for example, two isoforms of the N UFZ gene, NM_145697 and
NM_031423, are ranked as the 34th and 36th top DE isoforms, re—
spectively, so N UFZ is set once in the AGS. For the patient—specific
drivers, the AGS contains the top 100 genes for which at least one of
their isoforms exhibit the largest fold change, computed as tumor/
normal expression ratio in a specific patient.

While NEA measures how important a potential driver is in the
gene network, extreme expression may be another indicator for the
mutated potential driver to have a dramatic functional impact in
activating or silencing expression of the neighbor genes. So to
serve successfully as a putative driver, over— or under—expression,
ranked over the top 90th percentile of the absolute logz T/N expres—
sion distribution for which at least one of their isoforms is also
required.

Although a single mutation may not be associated with poor can—
cer survival (Goodwin et al., 2012), genomic instability accumulated
from a number of cancer—related mutations may result in a worse
prognosis (Salomon et al., 2013). So we compute the total number
of drivers weighted by their corresponding NEA z—scores as a meas—
ure of mutation load, so a driver with a higher z—score would be
assigned a larger weight. We term the weighted sum a ‘driver—gene
score’ (DGscore).

A more detailed description of the integrative algorithm can be
found in the Supplementary Material (section Integrative algorithm).
We provide a website http://fafner.meb.ki.se/biostatwiki/driver—
genes/ with examples of scripts to use the various tools in the
pipeline.

2.3 Clinical validation and comparisons

We use the DGscore derived from the integrative analysis to assess
the prognosis of the 60 TCGA patients, where we shall compare pa—
tients with DGscore larger than the median versus those lower than
the median. We note that the DGscore has been computed independ—
ently from the survival information, so this survival analysis is un—
biased. Two well—known prognostic signatures are compared: (i)
the 70—gene MammaPrint (van ’t Veer et al., 2002) and (ii) the 50—
gene PAM50 classifier (Parker et al., 2009). These are described
later. Survival times are visualized with Kaplan—Meier plots and the
P—value for the difference between the survival curves is calculated
by the log—rank test.

The expression profiles and clinical datasets for 117 breast can—
cer patients in the study conducted by van ’t Veer et al. (2002) can
be obtained from the R package mammaPrintData at http://astor.
som.jhmi.edu/~marchion/breastTSP.html. Forty—four patients re—
mained disease—free of at least 5 years after their initial diagnosis.
The intensity values on log scale are standardized such that every
patient has a mean intensity value of zero and a standard deviation
of one. Out of the 70 prognostic markers in MammaPrint, 47 are
present in the TCGA expression data; the rest appear to be ex—
pressed sequence tags (ESTs) that are not mapped in standard data—
bases. The risk score is computed based on the correlation of the 47
genes from each TCGA patient to the average expression profile of
the good—prognosis patients in the original van ’t Veer et al. study
(2002). The 60 patients in TCGA study are then split into two prog—
nostic groups using median correlation coefficient as a cutoff.

The 50 genes in PAM50 are used for classification of breast can—
cer into five intrinsic molecular subtypes: basal—like, HER2—
enriched, luminal A (LumA), luminal B (LumB) and normal—like.
Two versions of risk of relapse (ROR) scores are proposed by
Parker et al. (2009): (i) ROR—S uses the intrinsic subtypes predicted
by the 50—gene PAM50 classifier and (ii) ROR—C combines the pre—
dicted subtypes and tumor size. These are

ROR-S : O . OSbasal + O .12HER2 — O . 34LumA+ O .23LumB
ROR-C: O . OSbasal+ 0.11HER2 — O.23LumA+ O . 09LumB+ 0.17
size.

The centroids predicted by the 5 0—gene classifier are obtained from
R package genefu (Haibe—Kains et al., 2012). Correlation between
the expression profile of the 50 genes and centroids is calculated for
each TCGA60 paired samples. Using the correlation for the sub—
types, ROR score is computed for each patient according to the co—
efficients listed earlier. Threshold is determined from the median of
the ROR score to split the patients into two groups, for which sur—
vival time is compared.

3 Results

3.1 TCGA60 paired samples

Among the TCGA60 paired samples, we identify 16 recurrent
mutated isoforms with high impact and 245 with moderate impact.
Among these frequently mutated variants, the NEA analysis finds 17
common potential driver genes, namely, CHDIL, ADCYI 0,
HEATRI, MUC4, DSPP, PKHDI, LPA, COL14A1, MKI67,
OVCHI, RNF17, DNAH3, CDHII, CRISPLDZ, FANCA, BRCA1
and LAMAI. Figure 2 illustrates the gene network involving
FANCA, BRCAI, MKI67 and HEATRI genes. By construction in
the algorithm, these genes are enriched in their links to genes that
are differently expressed between tumors and normals.

To identify the patient—specific drivers that may be neglected in
the common—driver genes, we perform the NEA within each patient,
where the altered gene—set is defined as the top 100 isoforms having
the largest fold—change in expression between tumor and normal. In
total, we found 27 patient—specific drivers, but 15 of them are al—
ready among the common drivers; the other 12 are TP53, N OM01,
AIFMI, BCLAFI, HMCN1, NBPF9, ABCAI, CAPN9, GPR98,
LMO7, TTN and KRT14. Illustrating the strictness of the algo—
rithm, the PIK3CA gene, which is mutated in 14 patients, is not
identified either as a common driver or as a patient—specific driver in
any of the patients.

The computed DGscore ranges between 0 and 11.8, and a high
DGscore is defined as larger than the median value of 0.54.
Figure 3a shows that breast cancer patients with a high DGscore
have relatively poor survival (P20.001). As shown in Figure 3b,
had we simply reported the crude (uncharacterized) number of mu—
tations, with 394 exhibiting high impact and 6738 with moderate
impact, we would not be able to predict the patients’ survival
(P: 0.25), demonstrating the importance of filtering by frequency
of mutation pattern, expression level and functional characterization
by NEA.

Isoforms of a gene are templates for producing distinct but
related proteins. Many isoforms have been found to be implicated in
a wide range of human diseases (Nagao et al., 2005). Thus, it is cru—
cial to separate the isoforms of the same gene. Summarized gene
expression may cancel out the different expression pattern between
isoforms and subsequently affect the counting of drivers. In fact,
DGscore calculated at gene—level is not a significant prognostic

factor (Fig. 3c, P : 0.12), suggesting the importance of isoform—level
expression. A higher z—score of a candidate driver from NEA implies
a more strongly connected network between a driver and its differ—
entially expressed neighbors, so it seems sensible to assign a large
weight to a high z—score driver. In Figure 3d, we observe that an
unweighted DGscore could predict patient survival, although yield—
ing a slightly less significant P—value of 0.005, when compared with
the P—value of 0.001 derived from the weighted score (Fig. 3a).

As tumor stage, hormone—receptor status and age are known
prognostic factors in breast cancer, next we investigate whether the
DGscore has an independent prognostic effect. Table 1 summarizes
the results of the Cox regression analysis. The first four rows of the
table show the individual predictors in univariate regression, show—
ing DGscore to be the only significant predictor. The last three lines
indicate that DGscore remains highly significant after adjusting for
estrogen—receptor status, tumor stage or age.

An important feature of the DGscore is that it integrates infor—
mation on mutation and expression, each of which provides a differ—
ent view of potential molecular defects in cancer. To include a gene
as a potential driver, over— or under—expression is required for it to
be counted in the DGscore. If we ignore this criterion, all common
drivers and patient—specific driver genes characterized by NEA
would be counted in the DGscore even though not expressed, poten—
tially resulting in false positive cancer drivers. Figure 4a shows that
the incomplete DGscore is not associated with patient survival
(P z 0.72).

Similarly, as the 17 common—driver genes are not mutated in
every patient, we should be careful in accounting for the contribu—
tion of mutated common—driver genes to the DGscore. We should

than the median value. (a) Extreme expression is not an inclusion criterion;
the DGscore takes more driver genes into account than in the proposed algo-
rithm. (b) Always include all 17 common drivers in the DGscore regardless of
mutation status. (c) The DGscore takes only common drivers into account. (d)
The DGscore takes only patient-specific drivers into account

re—evaluate the survival characteristics associated with the DGscore
in the absence of mutation status for the common—driver genes. To
do so, every common—driver gene is optimistically assumed to con—
tain a somatic mutation, while patient—specific driver genes are
defined and accounted for in the usual way. The survival of patients
with the resulting high DGscore shows no difference to those with
low DGscore (Fig. 4b, P: 0.38). This confirms our hypothesis that
both types of molecular data, the somatic mutation and outlying ex—
pression of the potential driver genes, carry prognostic information.
Another important feature of the DGscore is that it summarizes
the recurrent and individualized signatures in tumors, by incorporat—
ing information contained in common—driver genes and patient—
specific driver genes. When we neglect patient—specific genes and
focus only on common—driver genes, we find that the partial list of
potential drivers cannot predict patient survival well (Fig. 4c,
P : 0.08). We would also miss out on well—established cancer genes
like TP53, which is observed as a patient—specific driver gene in
three patients. Alternatively, when we use NEA to select potential

driver genes based on T/N expression profiles within individual pa—
tient only, the survival curves of the high and low DGscore groups
exhibit only a borderline significant difference (P : 0.04, Fig. 4d).

3.2 Prediction comparison

We now compare with the performance of PAM50 ROR—C and
MammaPrint in predicting survival using the TCGA60 samples: see
Figure 5a and b. For the PAM50 signatures, there is little difference
in the prediction based on combined tumor size and intrinsic sub—
types (ROR—C, P:O.15) compared that based on subtypes only
(ROR—S, P: 0.19), so we only show the former. MammaPrint also
does not produce statistical significant result (P : 0.38). Thus
DGscore is the most significant predictor (Fig. 3a, P : 0.001).

We further investigate whether ROR—C and DGscore predict
prognosis independently. Given barely any correlation between
these two signatures, we fit a Cox proportional hazards regression
model with both as predictors. The P—values for DGscore and ROR—
C are 0.001 and 0.04, respectively, indicating DGscore is an inde—
pendent prognostic factor of survival.

3.3 Non—paired TCGA data

The availability of both DNA and RNA—seq data of paired tumor—
normal tissue in the TCGA60 samples is unique. We cannot find
other public breast cancer datasets that contain as rich information
as in the TCGA60 paired samples. Another set of 671 TCGA breast—
cancer samples, which do not overlap with the TCGA60 samples, is
available from International Cancer Genome Consortium (Zhang
et al., 2011).The dataset is described in detail in the Supplementary
Material (section Non—paired TCGA data). But unfortunately, only
expression data are available for tumor tissues and estimated only at
gene—level. We use the 17 common—driver genes as discovered in the
TCGA60 samples, while patient—specific driver genes are assessed
for the 6 71 samples. This is because the 17 common—driver genes are
identified based on a list of AGS derived from the top 100 genes
whose isoforms exhibit the greatest DE between all tumor versus all
normal tissues. Thus, we wanted to check if these 17 common—driver
genes are generalizable to other breast cancer patients.

In the absence of matched normal tissue, expression fold—change
of T/N cannot be obtained. So the expression—altered gene set in
NEA is defined as those genes whose absolute expression has the top
100 ranks among patients, to access the patient—specific driver genes.
Vital status data are available, but not survival time, so only the
Wilcoxon rank—sum test is carried out. The test shows no significant
difference in DGscores between patients who have died and those
still alive (P : 0.78). This result is consistent with what we
observe in Figure 3c, demonstrating the necessity of isoform—level

quantification in order for the algorithm to be able to identify poten—
tial cancer drivers. Furthermore using microarray—derived gene ex—
pression, we investigate the properties of the proposed algorithm to
identify putative driver genes, under the circumstances of no muta—
tion data nor isoform—level expression. We obtain a negative result
of P—value 0.75 which is also in line with our expectation, since mu—
tation status and isoform—level information is not available. The
dataset and result are described in detail in the Supplementary
Material (section Swedish microarray data).

4 Discussion

We have developed and illustrated an analytical framework to ex—
ploit the various molecular data that will likely be commonly gath—
ered from cancer patients. This framework allows integration of
mutation, expression and functional data, a weighting scheme for
counting putative driver genes and a method for identifying drivers
in a global and patient—specific manner based on the network enrich—
ment analysis. The resulting score is shown to have clinical relevance
in terms of significant association with patient survival that is stron—
ger compared with other existing expression—based signatures.

Some of the identified potential common—driver genes, such as
FANCA, CHDIL, ADCYIO, MUC4, PKHDI, MKI67, OVCHI
and BRCA1, are implicated in many important functional roles in
tumorigenesis, such as DNA repair, cell proliferation and differenti—
ation (Castella et al., 2011; Cooke and Brenton, 2011; Flacke et al.,
2013; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2013; Nishimiya et al., 2014; Pines
et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2012). The algorithm
also allows the identification of patient—specific driver genes, which
are candidates for contributing to personalized treatment. The iden—
tified patient—specific genes include the extensively reported tumor
suppressor gene TP53. In a recent study, sustained expression of
mutant TP53 has been shown to be required to drive pancreatic can—
cer metastasis (Weissmueller et al., 2014), implying that for a tumor
suppressor to be deleterious, its expression does not have to be
downregulated. This study also supports our criteria in selecting
potential cancer drivers, for which both mutation and abnormal ex—
pression are required, regardless of the direction of regulation.

Unlike some existing expression—based signatures, our method
does not simply produce prognostic biomarkers. What we gain from
the integration of molecular and functional data is a list of patient—
specific potential cancer drivers, so it has specific implications for
personalized cancer therapy. A well—characterized true driver will
also provide biologists with insights into cancer etiology.

Our study has its limitations. First, it is based on a small sample.
Presently, we are not aware of large—scale study using the paired
tumor—normal samples with both DNA and RNA—sequence data.
But even in this small study, the DGscore is highly correlated with
patient survival, more so than some existing prognostic factors, such
as tumor stage and estrogen—receptor status, and some existing ex—
pression—based signatures. Applying MammaPrint and PAM50 gene
signatures to the TCGA expression data, we observe some differ—
ences in the survival curves, although none of the P—values are sig—
nificant. The failure of these established prognostic markers is most
likely due to the small sample size but perhaps also because they
were trained using distant recurrencejmetastasis rather than survival
outcome. Only 67% of the 70 gene identifiers in MammaPrint is
mapped to the RefSeq gene names in the TCGA data, whereas the
unmapped ones are those not annotated to standard databases.
Hence, it is possible that the fewer number of mapped genes relative
to the original study results in the suboptimal performance of
MammaPrint.

Integration of somatic mutation, expression and functional data

2613

 

Second, since only exome sequencing, but not whole—genome
sequencing, is available, the data cannot capture driver mutations
residing in non—coding regions. Furthermore, the annotation and
functional characterization of genes rely on (i) known databases, (ii)
non—directional biological network and (iii) predicted impact on
protein coding. These are most likely incomplete and not necessarily
validated. With more progress in completing the functional annota—
tion, our approach would make an even more accurate identification
of the potential drivers. Experimentally validated directional net—
works would be useful for assessing the causal relationship between
a putative driver gene and its neighbors. Future works will include
applying the scheme to identify putative cancer drivers in large—scale
datasets in different cancers.

5 Conclusion

We develop a practical analysis pipeline to perform somatic variant
calling, gene and isoform expression quantification and the integra—
tion of genomic and transcriptomic profiles based on known biolo—
gical network and the functional impact on protein coding. Using
this methodology, we show that breast cancer patients who carry
more mutated genes with functional implications and extreme ex—
pression pattern have worse survival than those with less potential
driver genes.

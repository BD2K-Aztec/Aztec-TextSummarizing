Abstract

Motivation: Huge genetic datasets with dense marker panels are now common. With the availabil—
ity of sequence data and recognition of importance of rare variants, smaller studies based on
pedigrees are again also common. Pedigree—based samples often start with a dense marker panel,
a subset of which may be used for linkage analysis to reduce computational burden and to limit
linkage disequilibrium between single—nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Programs attempting to
select markers for linkage panels exist but lack flexibility.

Results: We developed a pedigree—based analysis pipeline (PBAP) suite of programs geared
towards SNPs and sequence data. PBAP performs quality control, marker selection and file prepar—
ation. PBAP sets up files for MORGAN, which can handle analyses for small and large pedigrees,
typically human, and results can be used with other programs and for downstream analyses. We
evaluate and illustrate its features with two real datasets.

1 Introduction

Technical advances have allowed the acquisition and use of tremen—
dous amounts of marker data for both population— and pedigree—
based genetic studies (Lambert et (11., 2013; Mardis, 2008, 2011;
Metzker, 2010; Ragoussis, 2009; Schadt et (11., 2010; Shendure and
Ji, 2008; Wang et (11., 2013). For human population—based studies,
multiple computational tools and workflows already exist for file
manipulation, quality control (QC) and basic analysis of genotype
data (Fan and Song, 2012; Fuchsberger et (11., 2012; Gogarten et (11.,
2012; Laurie et (11., 2010; Matise et (11., 2011; Patel and Jain, 2012;
Pongpanich et (11., 2010; Purcell et (11., 2007; Ritchie et (11., 2010;
Zhou et (11., 2013). For pedigree—based studies, preparation and

manipulation of files is similarly crucial for downstream analyses.
Some tools used to format files and perform QC in population—based
studies can also be used in pedigree studies, but additional pedigree—
specific preparations are also necessary in the search for rare, high
risk sequence variants.

Pedigree—based designs are again being used in the search for rare
disease—causing variants. Pedigree—based datasets are a useful re—
source (Wijsman, 2012), and diverse analysis programs exist that
can handle smaller pedigrees (e.g. Merlin) (Abecasis et (11., 2002)
and large pedigrees (e.g. Simwalk2, MORGAN) (Sobel and Lange,
1996; Thompson, 2011) with extensive marker data. For computa—
tional reasons, smaller pedigrees are typically less than ~27 bits,

while larger pedigrees are at least ~27 bits (bits : 2n—f; where
71 :number of non—founders and f: number of founders). Searches
for rare variants often start with linkage analysis for a particular
trait (Hinrichs and Suarez, 2011; Keramati et (11., 2014; Musunuru
et (11., 2010; Rosenthal et (11., 2011; Zhao et (11., 2013) with follow—
up on sequence data in the linkage regions from the same families.
Considerable software exists for carrying out computations on pedi—
grees to extract maximal information on identity—by—descent (IBD)
(Abecasis et (11., 2002; Gudbjartsson et (11., 2000; Heath, 1997;
Sobel and Lange, 1996; Tong and Thompson, 2008). Smaller pedi—
grees can be analyzed with exact computation, while larger pedi—
grees require Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling (Lange
and Sobel, 1991; Thompson, 1994). It is important to note that full
pedigree analysis based on IBD probability estimation can be sub—
stantially more powerful than approaches that split the pedigrees
followed by exact IBD computation, thus emphasizing the need for
use of MCMC sampling methods in the context of large pedigrees
(Saint—Pierre et (11., 2014).

Careful sub—selection of markers is necessary for some analyses
when dense markers are available on pedigrees (Santorico and
Edwards, 2014). In a multipoint analysis, it is important to minimize
linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers to avoid inﬂated type
I error rates (Abecasis et (11., 2002; Huang et (11., 2004; Schaid et (11.,
2002; Webb et (11., 2005) and to comply with intrinsic assumptions
in the computational algorithm (Lander and Green, 1987) used by
most programs that carry out multipoint analyses. It is also import—
ant to minimize the number of markers used to reduce computa—
tional time, while retaining enough markers to achieve high
information concerning inheritance patterns. It is not necessary to
use all markers (Wilcox et (11., 2005). The block—based approach,
which was developed for smaller pedigrees to circumvent the LD
problem, is no longer as effective as it originally was due to the dens—
ity of current marker panels coupled with the constraints on the
block size (Abecasis et (11., 2002). All three goals can be achieved by
judicious selection of a subset of markers from a dense panel of
markers.

Most modern linkage analysis programs make use of inheritance
vectors (IVs), which represent the ﬂow of chromosome positions
through pedigrees (Kruglyak et (11., 1996; Lander and Green, 1987;
Lange and Sobel, 1991; Thompson, 2011). IVs are typically used in—
ternally for linkage analysis using the Lange—Sobel estimator (Lange
and Sobel, 1991). MCMC estimation is employed by several linkage
analysis programs [e.g. MORGAN, Simwalk2 and Superlink—Online
single—nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)] for large pedigrees
(Silberstein et (11., 2013; Sobel and Lange, 1996; Tong and
Thompson, 2008). IV probabilities can also be used to estimate IBD
sharing between pairs of individuals (Koepke and Thompson, 2013;
Thompson, 2011). These probabilities may be stored for later re—
use, providing significant computational advantages in downstream
analyses. IVs may also be used to augment sequence data by geno—
type imputation (Abecasis et (11., 2002; Cheung et (11., 2013) and sub—
sequently evaluated by family—based single—SNP or SNP—set
association analyses (Chen et (11., 2013; Fridley et (11., 2010; Kang
et (11., 2010; Saad and Wijsman, 2014).

Despite the availability of various computational tools for pedi—
gree analyses, we still lack a unified comprehensive system that eases
the crucial steps needed to work with dense markers. Older file ma—
nipulation and QC tools exist that were developed for use with
sparse microsatellite or SNP panels (Abecasis et (11., 2002; Epstein
et (11., 2000; McPeek and Sun, 2000; O’Connell and Weeks, 1998;
Sun et (11., 2002) but are not always suitable or accurate for use with
current, dense genotyping. File manipulation tools for dense data

are available (Mukhopadhyay et (11., 2005; Purcell et (11., 2007), but
preparing files can be challenging especially when studies involve
data for large pedigrees or when they entail combining data from
multiple file sources. At least two programs exist that begin to ad—
dress selection of a subset of markers for linkage analysis: MArker
SElection for Linkage (MASEL) (Bellenguez et (11., 2009) and
LINKDATAGEN (Bahlo and Bromhead, 2009). MASEL selects
SNPs based on a user—specified LD threshold and weights for several
parameters (Bellenguez et (11., 2009) but does not impose a minimum
intermarker distance (MID) and requires prior steps to filter SNPs.
LINKDATAGEN performs error checks, removes all Mendelian in—
consistent errors and selects SNPs based on user—specified bin size,
minimum distance between markers and HapMap population—
specific allele frequencies (Bahlo and Bromhead, 2009; Frazer et (11.,
2007) but does not specifically use LD to select SNPs. Neither pro—
grams have options to force inclusion nor exclusion of specific
markers. It is therefore possible to perform file manipulation,
marker selection and QC checks by using multiple existing tools,
but a unified system that performs all desired functions would be
useful.

We have developed a pedigree—based analysis pipeline (PBAP)
suite of programs that carry out file manipulations and QC checks
prior to downstream analyses, with a focus on human data. PBAP
prepares data files in a MORGAN—compatible format, carries out
marker and pedigree QC analyses and automates marker selection
for a good linkage panel while allowing the user considerable ﬂexi—
bility for inclusion or exclusion of markers. Results obtained after
running programs of the MORGAN package (Thompson, 2011) on
the formatted files can be used for various downstream analyses.

2 Methods

2.1 Description of PBAP

2.1.1 Data input files

PBAP, schematically illustrated in Figure 1, uses two project data in—
put files: a pedigree file and a genotype file. An optional phenotype
file may also be present. For the genotype file, two formats may be
used: (i) a normal file format, e.g. PLINK "'.ped (Purcell et (11., 2007),
has the genotype data for individuals in rows (i.e. row: subject), as is
typical in linkage analysis software (Abecasis et (11., 2002; Cottingham
et (11., 1993; Lathrop et (11., 1984), while (ii) a transposed file format
has genotype data for each individual in columns (i.e. row: marker),
as is used in genotype imputation and in GWAS software (Browning
and Browning, 2009; Marchini et (11., 2007; Purcell et (11., 2007).
PBAP carries out further steps with the transposed file format, which
allows processing of dense genotype data. Input files that are in the
normal file format are first converted into the transposed file format.
Details of these two file formats and ancillary files are provided in the
PBAP documentation. We note that although the emphasis here is on
use of SNP arrays, PBAP also allows inclusion of short tandem repeats
(STR5) in a marker subpanel (described further below).

PBAP uses two main types of reference data input files: map files
[e.g. PLINK "'.map (Purcell et (11., 2007)] and main population geno—
type files [e.g. derived from the 1000 Genomes Project [1000 G]
data (Altshuler et (11., 2010)]. We have constructed such files from
public data, although PBAP users may construct and use any refer—
ence files of their choice that contain the necessary information.
These reference files should be prepared prior to using PBAP. For
the reference map files, we combined the Rutgers smoothed frame—
work map and the Rutgers map of all dbSNP Build 134 variants
(Matise et (11., 2007). On the merged map files, we converted

subpanels suitable for linkage analysis may be selected from the dense pan-
els. The IVs for each marker subpanel are sampled by gLauto of the
MORGAN package (Thompson, 2011)

Kosambi distances between markers to Haldane distances, thus pro—
viding Haldane genetic locations (cM). For the reference genotype
files, we downloaded 1000G data. We used a custom Perl script,
which is included in the PBAP release, to pre—process the 1000G
genotype files (i.e. to exclude indels and duplicate entries) for the
different main populations [African (AFR), Admixed American
(AMR), East Asian (ASN) and European EUR)] (Altshuler et al.,
2010). In all examples presented here, we used the genotype data for
the European population. In selecting marker subpanels described
below, PBAP requires pedigree files, these pre—processed reference
genotype files, and uses PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) to calculate
main population allele frequencies and to generate LD estimates.

2.1.2 Marker subpanels

We define a marker subpanel to be a subset of markers selected
from an original dense marker panel. From a dense panel, one or
more non—overlapping marker subpanels are selected in a stepwise
manner. The goal is to obtain good marker subpanels, which con—
tain highly informative markers for linkage analysis or IBD estima—
tion (Koepke and Thompson, 2013; Thompson, 2011). These
markers are chosen with three constraints: (i) to minimize LD
among selected markers (Abecasis et al., 2002; Huang et al., 2004;
Schaid et al., 2002; Webb et al., 2005), (ii) to be spaced at a distance
that is compatible with MCMC—based approaches (Tong and
Thompson, 2008; Wijsman et al., 2006) and (iii) to minimize the
number of markers chosen within constraints 1—2 to minimize com—
putational time while retaining overall IBD information. For pedi—
gree structure validation, which may be necessary as simple sample
QC, only one marker subpanel across all chromosomes is needed.

For linkage analysis, two or more additional non—overlapping
marker subpanels may be useful as a check that undetected genotype
errors are not inﬂuential (Cheung et al., 2014). PBAP can select five
or more marker subpanels depending on the size of the dense panel.
PBAP users may also pre—specify markers that should be excluded
from the marker subpanel (i.e. exclusion markers) and/or included
in the marker subpanel (i.e. inclusion markers). Inclusion/exclusion
options are particularly useful when troubleshooting, comparing re—
sults from other studies or combining sparse STR marker panels
with denser SNP panels. For the inclusion markers, users should spe—
cify whether a marker should always be included in the marker sub—
panel (i.e. core inclusion marker) or will be given priority but should
pass thresholds for minimum MAF (in the reference dataset), min—
imum marker completion and should not be monomorphic in the
dataset (i.e. auxiliary inclusion marker). PBAP users should specify
the direction in which the markers will be processed [i.e. from up—
stream to downstream markers (forward direction) or from down—
stream to upstream markers (reverse direction)] and starting marker
(i.e. markers upstream or downstream of this marker will be
excluded when user chooses forward or reverse directions,
respectively).

The selection of marker subpanels for pedigree structure valid—
ation comprises three processes. The first process excludes markers
upstream or downstream of the user—specified starting marker and
uses a fifth of the user—defined MID in centimorgans (cM) to create
a distance—based reduced pre—subpanel to improve computational ef—
ficiency. For LD—based SNP pruning on this pre—subpanel (Purcell
et al., 2007), PBAP uses a maximum LD threshold (1’2) value speci—
fied by the user and a window size spanning ~1 cM that allows the
user to obtain an LD—reduced pre—subpanel. The second process re—
turns inclusion markers to this LD—reduced pre—subpanel. Core in—
clusion markers are permanently added into the marker subpanel,
while auxiliary markers must pass thresholds specified above. The
third process selects a set of markers for each of the marker subpa—
nels using following criteria: (i) choice of main reference population
to allow PBAP to use population allele frequencies appropriate for
the dataset, (ii) minimum and maximum MAF in the reference popu—
lation, (iii) minimum marker completion threshold of genotyped
subjects, (iv) inclusion/exclusion of monomorphic markers in the
dataset, (v) direction in which markers will be processed, (vi) start—
ing marker and (vii) MID. In a real pedigree dataset, the realized
MAF may be lower than it is in the reference population. PBAP se—
lects markers based on criteria (i) through (iv) before using criteria
(v) through (vii).

The same processes are also used for selecting marker subpanels
for linkage analysis or marker IBD estimation with one additional
step. This step identifies regions where adjacent markers in the pre—
subpanel currently have a distance of 22 MID (i.e. gaps). These
gaps are then filled in by allowing use of slightly less common vari—
ants (i.e. minimum MAF used is 0.05 lower than user—defined min—
imum MAF) and a slightly smaller MID (i.e. ~0.1 cM smaller than
the user—defined MID) but still using the same maximum MAF and
same thresholds for marker completion and 1’2. Filling in these gaps
minimizes loss of information that may be important for down—
stream analyses. PBAP cumulatively stores markers selected and ex—
cludes them in subsequent subpanels to obtain non—overlapping
subpanels. These criteria or parameters are listed in Table 1.

2.1.3 Pedigree structure validation
Relationship or sample errors are identified by comparing theoret—
ical coefficients based on pedigree structure (Karigl, 1981) with the

coefficients estimated using genotype data. PBAP uses a likelihood—
based estimator for computing kinship coefficients ((2)) and geno—
type—based identity by descent probabilities of sharing one allele (£1)
(Choi et al., 2009). Likelihood estimators are more efficient than
moment estimators (Anderson and Weir, 2007), and unlike moment
estimators that require dense arrays to achieve equivalent accuracy,
a likelihood estimator is reasonably accurate for use even with SNP
arrays that may sometimes consist of only sparse linkage panels
(Milligan, 2003). In the process of calculating (p and [21 based on the
pedigree structure, PBAP also identifies all pairs of simple relation—
ships as close as or closer than great—grandparent—great—grandchild.
Using empirical confidence intervals (CIs; see below) for both [£1
and (2; for a particular pair of individuals, PBAP compares pedigree—
based pairwise I21 and (p and genotype—based pairwise estimated [$1
and (2) to detect possible relationship errors. Once a potential error is
detected, the user must decide whether or not to correct it in the
pedigree and genotype input files (Fig. 1).

To generate empirical CIs for both [£1 and (2), we performed sev—
eral steps. First, we created a dataset that contains all pairs of simple
relationships, i.e. as close as or closer than great—grandparent—great—
grandchild. Second, we used allele frequencies of Illumina 6K array
markers from a real dataset (Allen—Brady et al., 2010; Cannon et al.,
2010; Coon et al., 2010) and simulated 10000 replicates of full
marker panels genome—wide on multiple copies of the dataset using
the program genedrop from the MORGAN package (Thompson,
2011). We represented 3 K, 6 K and 9 K panels, respectively, by
2819, 5624 and 8924 markers chosen from this Illumina 6 K array.
For the additional 3300 markers in the 9K panel, we randomly se—
lected allele frequencies of markers from the same Illumina 6K
array. We used the three panels to have good representation of a
genome—wide evenly spaced linkage panel (i.e. contains 5000—6000
markers). Third, we estimated the three identity coefficients (£0, [£1
and £2) from these simulated genotypes, where IQ,- is the probability
of sharing 1' alleles IBD. Using these three identity coefficients, values
for (2) were estimated (Choi et al., 2009). Last, the empirical CIs of
[£1 and (2) for different numbers of panel markers in each of the rela—
tionship categories were estimated based on the minimum and

maximum values obtained for the three panels above (Fig. 2;
Supplementary Figs S1 and S2) using a linear model with quadratic
coefficients. The combined set of empirical CIs for each pair of sim—
ple relationships mentioned above for [21 and (p, whose expectations
are the pedigree—based coefficients, are unique and are therefore suf—
ficient to distinguish these relationships from one another.

2.1.4 Sampling realizations of IVs

For each marker subpanel generated, PBAP prepares MORGAN—
compatible files and executes the program gl_auto of the
MORGAN package (Thompson, 2011) to sample realizations of
IVs at each subpanel marker location and to check for Mendelian
inconsistencies. When found, PBAP zeroes out the genotypes of all
individuals in that pedigree for that particular marker. There are
three major advantages to use MORGAN for pedigree computa—
tions. First, use of gl_auto for preliminary analyses dramatically
speeds up subsequent analyses. Second, MORGAN handles large
and complex (e.g. with cross generational marriages, inbreeding or
marriage loops) pedigrees with MCMC—based computations faster
and more accurately than other programs (Wijsman et al., 2006).
Third, MORGAN combines exact and MCMC computation, allow—
ing exact computation for smaller pedigrees without user interven—
tion. The sampled IVs are then available for use in a multitude of
possible downstream analyses. As part of the file preparation with
PBAP, the user specifies conditions required for gl_auto (Table 1).
PBAP calculates an appropriate number of burn—in iterations and
executes gl_auto to perform the analysis. Sampled IVs are pedigree—
and chromosome specific.

2.2 Evaluation of PBAP

To illustrate the performance of PBAP, we used two real autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) datasets that comprise (i) 71 small to large
pedigrees (ASD1) (2—9 generations) (Allen—Brady et al., 2010;
Cannon et al., 2010; Coon et al., 2010) and (ii) a five—generation
large pedigree with evidence of linkage to chromosome 22
(Marchani et al., 2012) (ASD2). We used genome—wide data of
ASD1 and ASD2 to demonstrate pedigree structure validation and
chromosome 22 data of ASD2 to demonstrate marker subpanel se—
lection. For ASD1, we had SNP data comprising markers in the
Illumina 6 K and Illumina OmniExpress arrays where we used the
latter array for pedigree structure validation in the presence of sam—
ple swaps described below. For ASD2, we had dense marker panel

data comprising markers in the Illumina OmniExpress array. We
carried out all steps described above with PBAP on both ASD1 and
ASD2 including (i) formatting the input files, (ii) validating relation—
ships, (iii) generating marker subpanels suitable for linkage analysis
from either the OmniExpress array or the 6 K array and (iv) running
gl_auto to sample realizations of IVs. All of these steps take a few se—
conds or minutes to run with two exceptions. First, while calculation
of genotype—based kinship coefficients in ASD1 (195 individuals,
5789 markers) and ASD2 (42 individuals, 5678 markers) took only
~5 min and ~18 s using a single core on a multi—core 2.26 GHz Intel
Xeon computer, respectively, execution time is proportional to the
number of markers and to the square of the number of genotyped in—
dividuals and thus increases rapidly with sample size. Second, selec—
tion of one marker subpanel from the ASD2 panel of ~3500
markers on chromosome 22 used here took ~39 s but execution
time increases with each additional non—overlapping subpanel gener—
ated (e.g. obtaining five non—overlapping subpanels from this panel
took about ~4 min). In all of the analyses where PLINK was needed,
we used PLINK v1.07. For comparison to an alternative, we also
carried out marker selection using the marker subpanel selection
tool, MASEL (Bellenguez et al., 2009).

2.2.1 Pedigree structure validation

We performed pedigree structure validation on ASD1 and ASD2.
For each dataset, we selected one marker subpanel using the follow—
ing criteria: (i) MID 2 0.5 cM, (ii) marker completion2 80%, (iii)
1’2 S 0.25 (less stringent since kinship estimation is not strongly af—
fected by LD), (iv) 0.3 S MAF S 0.5 in 1000 G data since more com—
mon variants provide better kinship estimates and (v) starting
marker. In all subpanel selections performed in this article, we
excluded markers that were monomorphic in the dataset. Based on
the specified pedigree structures of ASD1 (Illumina 6 k panel) and
ASD2, we used PBAP to calculate the pedigree—based (p and to iden—
tify close relatives. We then computed genotype—based [£1 and (2) for
all pairs with genotype data. Pedigree— and genotype—based coeffi—
cients were compared to detect possible relationship errors. In add—
ition, we created four different sample swaps simultaneously in
three families of ASD1 (Illumina OmniExpress array) to further il—
lustrate pedigree QC with PBAP. The relationship errors introduced
were (i) parent—offspring, (ii) first—cousin, (iii) full—sibling—unrelated
and (iv) parent—avuncular sample swaps. We created a full—sibling—
unrelated swap between a full—sibling (FS) and a sister—in—law, and a
parent—avuncular swap between an FS pair where at least one of the
siblings has one or more offspring.

2.2.2 Generating marker subpanels and performing linkage analysis
Using PBAP, we selected three non—overlapping marker subpanels to
probe possible influential errors. We used the same MID and marker
completion criteria used for pedigree structure validation but with
r2 S 0.04 (more stringent to minimize LD between markers),
0.2 S MAF S 0.5 in 1000 G data (common variants with lower min—
imum to allow inclusion of more markers) and different starting
markers (any number from 1 to 10) to facilitate variability. Since
chromosome 22 spans ~80 cM, a target intermarker distance of
~0.5 cM results in a maximum of ~120—160 markers, as was
achieved using PBAP. Since MASEL also uses LD as a criteria in se—
lecting marker subpanels, we compared MASEL with PBAP. To
achieve a fair comparison, we pre—filtered the SNPs prior to using
MASEL through the same MAF and marker completion criteria as
for PBAP. To select marker subpanels for linkage analysis using
MASEL, Bellenguez et al. (2009) used four different weighting

schemes: (1,1,1), (2,1,1), (1,2,1) and (1,1,2), representing different
choices for weighting heterozygosity, intermarker distance and set
size (i.e. number of SNPs removed due to LD or distance when a
particular SNP is selected), respectively, in selecting markers. For ex—
ample, for the first weighting scheme, MASEL uses equal weights
for heterozygosity, intermarker distance and set size. Although dis—
tance is one of the parameters used by MASEL, the program does
not allow the user to choose a specific MID. Using the same set of
four weighting schemes and an 1’2 S 0.04 (as for PBAP), we selected
four different marker subpanels using MASEL. This resulted in 400—
5 00 markers spanning chromosome 22 with many very close adja—
cent markers (0.002 cM). To obtain a sparser marker subpanel with
MASEL, we used a lower maximum 1’2 of 0.01 to select another set
of three and four marker subpanels using both PBAP and MASEL,
respectively. For each of these 14 marker subpanels (seven with r2 of
0.04 and seven with 1’2 of 0.01), we used PBAP and gl_auto to per—
form computations. For every marker subpanel, each analysis
included 2500 burn—in iterations, sampling by scan, generation of
50000 MCMC iterations, 50% L—sampler and saving 1000 realiza—
tions of IVs for inference.

To compare the impact of marker subpanels generated by
MASEL versus PBAP, we carried out linkage analysis with the IVs
obtained from gl_auto by running PBAP using each marker subpa—
nel, followed by the use of gl_lods of the MORGAN package
(Koepke and Thompson, 2013; Thompson, 2011). For this purpose,
we used data from a genome scan that identified positive evidence of
linkage (lodmX : 1.8) in linkage analysis on chromosome 22 for the
ASD2 dataset and used the same reduced—penetrance dominant
model used previously (Marchani et al., 2012). The program gl_lods
makes use of equivalence classes of locus—specific IVs (Koepke and
Thompson, 2013) to avoid redundant calculation, thus dramatically
increasing speed in the lod score computations.

3. Results

3.1 Reference data files and pedigree structure
validation

We used the reference map files together with the 1000 G reference
genotype files to select a set of non—overlapping marker subpanels
with PBAP (Table 2). We also used the allele frequencies from the
pre—processed 1000G data in analysis with gl_auto to obtain IVs.
We compared the pedigree— and genotype—based [£1 and (2) of the
ASD1 and ASD2 datasets using PBAP. For FS pairs, there was one
detected MZ twin pair in ASD1, while no relationship errors were
detected in ASD2. For the four different sample swaps created in
ASD2, PBAP ﬂagged extreme points outside the empirical CIs for
these parameters in all cases as shown in the different leg—k1 plots
(Fig. 3), illustrating its ability to detect these types of errors.

3.2 Marker subpanels generated through PBAP or
MASEL

Characteristics of the marker subpanels that were generated using
PBAP and MASEL are listed in Table 2 as ranges of values from
three and four subpanels, respectively. Marker completion and
MAF for all 14 marker subpanels from ASD2 are 295% and 20.15,
respectively. Minimum MAFs of marker subpanels with MASEL
(0.20—0.21) are relatively higher than with PBAP (0.15—0.17), since
PBAP lowers MAF in regions that require gap filling. MAF (ASD2
dataset) for all 14 marker subpanels is 20.012, which is lower than
the user—specified minimum MAF.

Since we used the same threshold for pre—filtering SNPs, dataset
marker completion and MAF were all within the ranges specified for
both types of panels. However, we obtained differences in the mean
intermarker distances between marker subpanels obtained by PBAP
and MASEL. For an 1’2 of 0.04, the mean intermarker distances of
PBAP and MASEL marker subpanels are 0.53—0.65 cM (range:
0.39—1.83 cM) and 0.16—0.17 cM (range: 0.002—1.49 cM), respect—
ively. After thinning, these MASEL marker subpanels mean inter—
marker distances increased to 0.48—0.51 cM (range: 0.01—1.98 cM)
similar to that from PBAP, but there are markers that are still near
each other even after thinning. For an 1’2 of 0.01, the mean
intermarker distances of PBAP and MASEL marker subpanels
are 0.57—0.69 cM (range: 0.4—1.96 cM) and 0.94—1.0 cM (range:
0.04—4.15 cM), respectively. Note that the mean intermarker dis—
tances of the PBAP marker subpanels are near 0.5 cM for both 1’2 of
0.04 and 0.01, while that of the MASEL marker subpanels varied
from 0.16 to 1.0 cM. Moreover, maximum intermarker distances
(cM) of the PBAP marker subpanels are <2 cM, with the larger gaps

3.3 Linkage analysis using sampled IVs

Both PBAP and thinned MASEL subpanels generated by using a
maximum 1’2 of 0.04 performed well in the region with the linkage
signal (40—53 cM) (Fig. 4A). Among all panels, PBAP subpanel
3 almost matched the original linkage signal obtained with STRs,
which was fully informative at the STR5 in the peak. Although most
of the panels give similar lod scores across the chromosome, PBAP

subpanel 2 has a higher signal compared with the rest of the panels
at positions ~25—30 cM. The marker(s) that provide more informa—
tion against linkage may have not been in this subpanel. Moreover,
all panels have more negative lod scores from ~12—22 cM and ~53—
60 cM compared with the original linkage lod scores in regions be—
tween two STRs.

A similar trend was observed in marker subpanels obtained by
PBAP and MASEL using a maximum 1’2 threshold of 0.01 (Fig. 413)
where almost all subpanels performed relatively well at the linkage
signal. However, with fewer markers, there was no longer a subpa—
nel that almost matched the original linkage signal. From position
~26—40 cM, where there was a small set of negative lod scores with
portions that are less negative in the original signal: the PBAP
marker subpanel 3 has two of this type of small set, one of which
has positive lod scores. In addition, all marker subpanels also have
more negative lod scores from ~12—22 cM and ~53—60 cM com—
pared with the original linkage lod scores. At this 1’2 threshold,
MASEL marker subpanels generated with different weighting
schemes give more variable linkage results at the highest original
linkage signal (~40—53 cM), while the non—overlapping PBAP sub—
panels still gave relatively consistent results.

4 Discussion

The use of dense markers in pedigree—based data analyses is chal—
lenging and requires nontrivial file manipulation. Selection of sub—
sets of markers, i.e. marker subpanels, from a dense panel can be a
complex process based on joint optimization across several param—
eters. Here, we introduce PBAP, a pipeline of programs that auto—
matically selects ideal subpanel(s) of markers from the complete
available panel and performs basic QC steps. One advantage of
PBAP is its ﬂexibility, unlike some other existing programs that
allow file preparation and analysis of pedigrees but have con—
straints in how they select marker subpanels from dense panels.
Finally, PBAP prepares files in a format suitable for pedigree—based
analyses (i.e. MORGAN file format) and accesses software (i.e.
gl_auto) (Thompson, 2011) to generate information suitable for
pedigree—based analyses involving IBD information. This is par—
ticularly useful when samples include large pedigrees where esti—
mation through MCMC is necessary, adding additional constraints
to selection of marker subpanels. It is important to select an in—
formative marker subpanel from a dense panel of SNPs to perform
pedigree—based analyses involving IBD. PBAP automatically selects
a subpanel with adequate flexibility for the user so that differences
in dense panels and evolving genotyping technologies should not
dramatically affect the results. In particular, PBAP includes specifi—
cation of constraints needed to use methods that allow analysis of
extended, as well as smaller, pedigrees. One of the main goals in
selecting marker subpanels is to minimize significant LD between
SNPs. The strategy used by PBAP avoids the need for considerable
data and computing resources imposed by trying to model LD dur—
ing the analysis and also scales easily to use of much denser data,
such as is present in high throughput sequencing. A second goal
was to facilitate use of computational methods that allow intact
large pedigrees. As this currently requires MCMC, PBAP controls
the MID and MAF chosen. Moreover, PBAP internally pre—filters
SNPs based on user—specified MID, dataset marker completion and
MAF range. With minute intermarker distances, MCMC—based
methods suffer (Sieh et al., 2005; Thompson and Heath, 1999;
Wilcox et al., 2005).

Similar results were observed from linkage analysis using both
MASEL and PBAP marker subpanels. A difference was the amount of

prior manipulation required to use MASEL for selecting subpanels,
which is done internally by PBAP based on user—specified parameters.
Comparable linkage results for both PBAP and MASEL subpanels
may, in part, be due to the fact that ASD2 is an example of well—geno—
typed complex pedigree, where problematic MCMC mixing due to
very small intermarker distances, and loss of information due to very
large intermarker distances may not have a large impact on the link—
age results. An important additional feature of PBAP is that it allows
generation of non—overlapping subpanels, which may facilitate detec—
tion of inﬂuential genotyping errors based on the linkage results
(Cheung et al., 2014). In addition, achieving similar linkage results
from non—overlapping subpanels strengthens the evidence for a linkage
signal and absence of a genotype error on a particular genomic region.

A dataset may or may not have already undergone some level of
QC before using PBAP. Our pipeline performs basic QC checks to
ensure detection of errors that may have been missed by other QC
procedures. When the dataset has relatively few genotyped individ—
uals, there are advantages to the use of external population allele
frequency estimates, and when the number of available markers
common across subjects is modest, a more accurate likelihood—based
estimator is a safer choice for relationship estimation than is a mo—
ment estimator. Pedigree structure validation in PBAP is useful in
distinguishing close relationship errors, which is sufficient (in most
cases) to detect sample swaps and misspecified relationships. Some
caution is needed to interpret ﬂagged relationships since these may
or may not indicate a true relationship error. Confirmed relationship
errors should be corrected by the user and may entail dropping cer—
tain individuals, editing the pedigree and/or genotype files and going
back to the beginning of the pipeline.

Although optimized for human pedigrees, PBAP may also be
used for other organisms as long as there is no selfing involved. The
pedigree structures of other organisms may be larger and more com—
plex than in humans but this does not provide a barrier. Except for
the pedigree structure validation step, which would require use of
other existing software, PBAP may be applied.

We have presented a unified comprehensive pipeline that per—
forms critical steps to handle dense genotype data and prepare files
for family—based downstream analyses. PBAP selects a good panel of
sparse markers and samples IVs. This framework allows the devel—
opment of additional modules that will carry out a variety of com—
putations given the sampled IVs as illustrated though our
computation of lod scores. PBAP thus enables a variety of analyses
on large pedigrees with dense markers with the opportunity to ex—
tend to other programs for downstream analyses.

Abstract

Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression through binding to specific target DNA sites.
Accurate annotation of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) at genome scale represents an es—
sential step toward our understanding of gene regulation networks. In this article, we present a
structure—based method for computational prediction of TFBSs using a novel, integrative energy
(IE) function. The new energy function combines a multibody (MB) knowledge—based potential and
two atomic energy terms (hydrogen bond and 7t interaction) that might not be accurately captured
by the knowledge—based potential owing to the mean force nature and low count problem. We
applied the new energy function to the TFBS prediction using a non—redundant dataset that con—
sists of TFs from 12 different families. Our results show that the new IE function improves the pre—
diction accuracy over the knowledge—based, statistical potentials, especially for homeodomain TFs,

the second largest TF family in mammals.

1 Introduction

Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by interacting
with specific DNA sequences called transcription factor binding sites
(TFBSs) (Lemon and Tjian, 2000; Levine and Tjian, 2003).
Identification of TFBSs on a genomic scale, a crucial step in genomic
annotation and in deciphering transcription regulatory networks, re—
mains a great challenge in post—genomic bioinformatics. With the
rapid increase of available genomic data, effective sequence—based
methods for TFBS predictions have been developed (Stormo, 2000).
However, one issue of sequence—based methods is the high number
of false—positive results, especially when the binding signal is weak
or the TF’s DNA—binding site is significantly different from the con—
sensus sequence.

Structure—based prediction methods, on the other hand, focus on
protein—DNA interactions rather than sequence conservation.
Therefore, they are not constrained by sequence information. These
prediction methods mimic real binding and recognition events be—
cause specific binding between a TF and its binding sites in the cell
relies on biophysical interactions. Whereas the sequence—based
methods and experimental technologies can identify the genome
binding site locations and binding site sequences, structure—based
methods can also explain why and how these TFs bind at these loca—
tions and sequences. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms and

effects of mutations on gene expression and diseases can guide ra—
tional design of therapeutic agents. Although research on protein—
DNA recognition began in the 1970s (Seeman et (11., 1976),
structure—based methods for prediction of TFBSs were not developed
until years ago when the high—resolution protein structures became
available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et (11., 2000).

One of the major issues in structure—based TFBS prediction is the
scoring function for evaluating binding affinity or binding energy
between proteins and DNA. There are two major types of energy
functions for studying protein—DNA interactions, the physics—based
molecular mechanics force fields and the knowledge—based statistical
potentials. Physics—based energy functions consist of physicochemi—
cal interactions including electrostatic interactions, van der Waals
(VDW) forces, solvation energy and others (Liu and Bradley, 2012).
These physics—based potentials rely on approximations and often as—
sume fixed charges. They have been applied to protein—DNA inter—
action studies with some success (Alibes et (11., 2010; Havranek
et (11., 2004; Morozov et (11., 2005; Siggers and Honig, 2007).
Besides the general terms such as VDW and electrostatic interactions
that include hydrogen bonds, rt—cation and 11—11 interactions have
also been studied in protein—DNA recognition. It was previously
thought that these interactions have a primary role in establishing
the stability of the protein—DNA complexes, but new data suggest
that these interactions may have a bigger role in protein—DNA

recognition (Baker and Grant, 2007; Luscombe et (11., 2001).
Although the physics—based energies can accurately describe
protein—DNA interactions, they are computationally expensive. In
addition, protein—DNA complexes are intrinsically dynamic. A
protein—DNA complex structure used for TFBS prediction only rep—
resents a snapshot of the structure with a large number of possible
conformations. Different conformations may result in different
TFBS predictions because physics—based energy functions are sensi—
tive to conformational changes.

Knowledge—based potentials are derived from statistical analysis
of a set of known, non—redundant protein—DNA complexes. They are
often preferred because they are relatively simple, less computa—
tionally expensive and less sensitive to conformational changes while
producing results comparable with physics—based predictions.
Knowledge—based potentials vary in resolution from residue—based
(Aloy et (11., 1998; Liu et (11., 2005; Mandel—Gutfreund and Margalit,
1998; Takeda et (11., 2013) to atom—based potentials (Donald et (11.,
2007; Robertson and Varani, 2007; Zhang et (11., 2005). They also
vary in their distance scales from distance independent (Aloy et (11.,
1998; Mandel—Gutfreund and Margalit, 1998) to distance dependent
(Liu et (11., 2005; Robertson and Varani, 2007; Takeda et (11., 2013;
Zhang et (11., 2005). Recent residue—level potentials have proven to
work well in protein—DNA interaction studies (Liu et (11., 2005;
Takeda et (11., 2013). However, statistical potentials may be limited
by two factors. One is the mean force nature of the knowledge—based
potentials. For example, amino acids arginine and lysine can contrib—
ute to both specific interactions with DNA through hydrogen bonding
and non—specific interactions through electrostatic interaction with
the DNA backbone. Though the hydrogen bonds are implicitly cap—
tured in knowledge—based potentials, they are ‘averaged’ with the
non—specific interactions. The other is caused by the low count prob—
lem. More recent studies have suggested that it interactions between
aromatic amino acids and DNA bases are more prevalent than preVi—
ously thought, though little is known about their critical role in spe—
cific protein—DNA binding (Wilson et (11., 2014; Wilson and
Wetmore, 2015). Through comparative analysis, we recently found
that tyrosine and histidine are enriched in interacting with DNA bases
in highly specific DNA—binding proteins (Corona and Guo, 2016).
We hypothesize that it interactions between aromatic residues and
DNA bases contribute to TF—DNA binding specificity. However,
these interactions may not be accurately captured in knowledge—based
potentials, as the number of aromatic residues that are involved in
protein—DNA interactions is relatively low.

Here, we propose a novel, integrative energy (IE) function that
combines a knowledge—based MB potential with hydrogen bond and
TE interaction information for prediction of TFBSs and apply it to the
binding site prediction of non—redundant datasets of TFs. The results
show that TFBS prediction using our new IE function improves ac—
curacy when compared with other residue—level and atomic—level
knowledge—based potentials.

2 Methods

IE function

The IE function consists of a knowledge—based MB potential (Liu
et (11., 2005) and two physics—based terms, hydrogen bond energy
and electrostatic potentials from it interactions:

ETotal I WMBEMB + WHBEHB + WnEn (1)

where BTW, is the total energy, EMB, EH3, and ET, represent the nor—
malized MB energy, hydrogen bond energy and it interaction energy,
respectively, and WMB, WHB and WT, are weights for each term. As
there are only a limited number of non—redundant TF—DNA com—
plexes with known TFBSs, we were unable to use training methods
to get an optimal set of weights. We used 1, 1 and 0.5 for WMB,
WHB and W”, respectively, in this study. The hydrogen bond energy
has equal weight to the knowledge—based potential owing to its im—
portant contribution to protein—DNA binding specificity (Luscombe
et (11., 2001). The weight for it interaction is half the weight of the
MB and hydrogen bond terms because it is less abundant and its
role in specific protein—DNA interaction is not as well defined as the
hydrogen bonds.

The knowledge—based, MB statistical potential

We have previously developed two residue—level knowledge—based
potentials, a MB potential and an orientation potential, for assessing
protein—DNA interactions in TFBS prediction and protein—DNA
docking (Liu et (11., 2005; Takeda et (11., 2013). The MB potential
uses structural environment for accurate assessment, whereas the
orientation potential uses both distance and angle information to
better capture hydrogen bond information implicitly. As we propose
an explicit hydrogen bond term in our new IE function to capture
the key hydrogen bond interactions, we chose the MB potential over
the orientation potential to minimize the overlap between the hydro—
gen bond energy and the orientation potential while taking the struc—
tural environment into consideration. In addition, we found that
even though the orientation potential performs better than the MB
potential for TF—DNA docking (Liu et (11., 2005; Takeda et (11.,
2013), the MB potential predicts TF—DNA binding motifs better
than the orientation potential possibly because of the capture of
interaction context, as structure—based prediction of TFBSs and pro—
tein—DNA docking are two different computational problems (data
not shown). The MB potential uses the distance between an amino
acid’s B—carbon and the geometric center of a nucleotide triplet. The
position of a nucleotide is represented by the N1 atom in pyrimidines
or the N9 atom in purines (Liu et (11., 2005; Takeda et (11., 2013).

Hydrogen bond energy
The hydrogen bond energy is calculated using the model described
by Thorpe et al. (Eq. 2), which was adapted from Dahiyat et al.
(1997; Thorpe et (11., 2001).

EHB I Vo{5 12 — 6(%)10}F(07 (1’7 ((7) (2)

where do (2.8 A) and V0 (8 kcal/mol) are the hydrogen bond equilib—
rium distance and well—depth, respectively, and d is the distance be—
tween the donor and the acceptor. The angle function, F, varies
depending on the hybridization state of the acceptor and donor
atoms (Dahiyat et (11., 1997; Thorpe et (11., 2001). We used FIRST
(Jacobs et (11., 2001), which implements Equation (2), to calculate
the hydrogen bond energy between amino acids and nucleotides in
the protein—DNA complexes (Abecasis et (11., 2010).

1: interaction energy

TE Interactions typically exist between aromatic compounds and cat—
ions, partially charged atoms or other aromatic compounds. These
interactions consist of VDW forces and electrostatic interactions
(Gromiha et (11., 2004; Luscombe et (11., 2001; McGaughey et (11.,
1998; Wintjens et (11., 2000). In aromatic compounds, it — it

interactions occur when the partially positive charges on the edges
of an aromatic molecule interact with the negatively charged elec—
tron cloud of another aromatic compound. These interactions can
be in a parallel stacked, parallel displaced or edge—to—face conform—
ation (Fig. 1). It appears that the VDW forces do not have a major
impact on DNA—binding specificity of TFs, but they assist greatly in
protein—DNA complex stability (2008; Gromiha et (11., 2004;
Wintjens et (11., 2000). However, the electrostatic charges on the
edges of the bases, especially in the major groove, are different in the
four DNA bases. Figure 2 shows the electronic landscape of the
atoms on each base at the resonant state, assuming a physiological
pH. The partially charged edges of the bases exposed in the major
groove (Table 1) were determined using MarvinSketch 6.1.4, a soft—
ware package from Chemaxon (Marvin6.1.4, 2013).

Mecozzi et al. calculated the binding energies of benzene as well
as other aromatic compounds of biological and medicinal interest
(Mecozzi et (11., 1996). Based on the relationships between the bind—
ing energy of benzene and the binding energy of the side chains of
the aromatic compounds, we estimated the charges on the electron
clouds of the aromatic residues (Table 2).

The electrostatic potential was then calculated using:

static potential is then converted from joules/mol to kcal/mol using
the conversion factor of 2.39 X 1071. The electrostatic potential of
each atom on the base with direct access to the electron cloud on the
amino acid is summed together to calculate the total 1t interaction
energy between the amino acid and base (Equation (4)).

tron cloud 6.

Prediction algorithm
The flowchart for the structure—based TFBS prediction is shown in
Figure 3. It begins with a TF—DNA complex structure consisting of a
single TF—chain/domain interacting with a duplex DNA. Hydrogen
atoms were added to the complex structure, which are needed for
hydrogen bond calculations, using UCSF Chimera 1.8 (Pettersen
et (11., 2004). The addition of hydrogen atoms may introduce steric
clashes, which was addressed by energy minimization using
Chimera with the following parameters: 100 steepest descent steps
with a step size of 0.02, 100 conjugate gradient steps with a step size
of 0.02 and an update interval of 10. A total of 8 bp, which include
residues contacting bases and ﬂanking bases, were used for the en—
ergy calculation. A residue—base contact is defined if the atom dis—
tance between the residue side chain and the base is within 3.9 
The native DNA sequence in the TF—DNA complex was mutated to
generate all possible combinations of the 8 bases, 65 536 sequences,
using 3DNA (Lu and Olson, 2003). The three energy terms were
then calculated for each of the 65 536 TF—DNA complex structures.
The score for each of the three terms, MB energy, hydrogen bond
energy and 1t interaction energy, was normalized using Equation (5):

complex with a sequence and Emax and Em,” are the maximum and

minimum energies in the set of 65 5 36 TF—DNA complexes, respect—
ively. The total energy is then calculated using Equation (1). The dis—
tribution of IE scores is generated using R, and a significance level or
is used to select the statistically significant sequences. In this study,
we used or of 0.01 divided by the number of contacted DNA bases to
normalize the number of expected sequences. The rationale of using
adjusted or is that for a fixed number of DNA binding sequences, if
more bases are involved in TF—DNA interaction and are conserved,
the expected number of binding sequences should be smaller. The
sequences with energy scores in the adjusted or region were then
selected to generate a position weight matrix (PWM) and motif logo
(Fig. 3).

PWM prediction and validation

PWMs are generated using the selected sequences from the distribu—
tion of IE scores. First, a 4 X 8 position frequency matrix (PFM) is
generated using these sequences. The PFM is then converted to a
PWM and subsequently converted to a motif logo using the method
described by Schnieder and Stephens (Crooks et (11., 2004; Schneider
and Stephens, 1990).

The predicted PWMs were compared with their corresponding
JASPAR PWMs (Mathelier et (11., 2014). We used three quantitative
measures to score the similarity between the predicted and the refer—
ence PWMs: Chi—square test, averaged Kullback—Leibler (AKL) di—
vergence (Wu et (11., 2001; Xu and Su, 2010) and Euclidean distance
(Blaisdell, 1986; Xu and Su, 2010). We also used a method called in—
formation content (IC)—weighted Pearson correlation coefficient
(PCC) (Persikov and Singh, 2014), developed recently by Persikov
and Singh, to measure the similarity of corresponding columns from
the predicted and reference PWMs. These columns represent aligned
base positions in the binding motif. A predicted column is con—
sidered to be a correct prediction if the IC—weighted PCC between

Datasets

The first dataset is a non—redundant set of TF chain—DNA com—
plexes. It was generated using all the high—quality crystal structures
of TF—DNA complexes in the PDB with corresponding JASPAR
PWMs. These structures were solved by X—ray crystallography with
a resolution <3A and R—factors 30.3. All structures with a sequence
identity of 35% or greater were first grouped together. The TF—
DNA complex structure with a corresponding JASPAR PWM and
the highest resolution in a group was chosen as the group’s represen—
tative. This dataset has 29 non—redundant TF chain—DNA com—
plexes from 12 TF families: helix loop helix, zinc fingers,
homeodomains, leucine zippers, signal transducer and activator of
transcription 1 (STAT1), fork head, ETS family, high mobility group
(HMG), NFAT, SMAD, P53 DNA binding domain and runt do—
mains. The PDB chains in the dataset are 1AM9:A, 1BC8:C,
1BF5:A, 1DSZ:A, 1GU4:A, 1H8A:C, 1H9D:A, 1JNM:A, 1LLM:C,
1NKPzA, 1NLW:A, 1NLW:B, 10Z]:A, 1P7th, 1PUFzA, 1PUFzB,
1T2K:A, 2A07:A, 2ACOzA, 2DRPzA, 2HDD:A, 2QL2:A, 2QL2:B,
ZUZKzA, ZYPAzA, 3F27:A, 4F6M:A, 4HN5:A and 4IQR:A.

We also generated a second non—redundant set for special case
studies. Homeodomain proteins are involved in regulation of many
cellular processes in mammals and represent the second largest fam—
ily of TFs (Tupler et (11., 2001). There are a large number of experi—
mentally determined PWMs for homeodomains and a relatively
large number of homeodomain—DNA complex structures in the
PDB. A homeodomain is a three or—helical DNA binding domain that
binds to both the major groove and minor groove of the target DNA
sequences (Gehring et (11., 1994). To generate this dataset, we com—
bined both the protein sequence similarity and binding site similar—
ity. The homeodomain dataset consists of TF chain—DNA
complexes with a corresponding JASPAR PWM. Each pair of the
homeodomains in the dataset has <55 % protein sequence similarity
and different annotated binding sites in JASPAR (based on the
IC—weighted PCC criteria of 0.25 or larger for the matching pos—
itions). This dataset includes 1B8I:A, 1B8I:B, 1IC8:A, 1IG7:A,
1JGGzB, 1PUF:A, 1PUF:B, 3RKQzA, ZHDDzA, 3A01:A and
3A01:B. One exception is that we included both 1B8I:B and 1PUF:B
because they have different binding sites even though they share
82% sequence identity. This is to test the capability of the new IE
function to see if we can accurately predict different binding sites for
highly similar proteins.

3 Results

We applied the new IE function to the prediction of TFBSs using the
non—redundant dataset of 29 TF—DNA complex structures and com—
pared the prediction with MB potential and DDNA3, a knowledge—
based atomic—level protein—DNA interaction potential (Zhang et (11.,
2005). Five examples of the predicted TF—binding motifs and the
corresponding JASPAR motifs are shown in Figure 4A (all 29 pre—
dicted motifs are available in Supplementary Fig. S1). We also
applied three different quantitative methods, Chi—square test, AKL
divergence and Euclidean distance, to compare the prediction accur—
acy as described in Section 2. The lower the AKL divergence value,
the more is the similarity between the predicted PWMs and JASPAR
PWMs. Figure 4B shows the results based on AKL divergence to
demonstrate the similarity between the predicted PWMs and the ref—
erence JASPAR PWMs. Results from the other two methods are

consistent with the AKL divergence results (data not shown). As
shown in Figure 4, IE outperforms both MB and DDNA3 or at least
one of them in the majority of the cases, for example, 1AM9:A and
1PUF:B. There are three cases where IE performs worse than MB
and/or DDNA3, such as 1BF5:A and 2UZK:A. In several cases, the
prediction accuracies are similar among all three energy functions,
for example, 1DSZ:A.

To check if the overall improvements are statistically significant,
we performed Wilcoxon signed rank test to compare the predictions
between IE and MB as well as between IE and DDNA3 based on the
predicted similarity to JASPAR PWMs. The null hypothesis is that
prediction accuracy of the IE method is equal or worse than the MB
(or DDNA3) method, whereas the alternative hypothesis is that the
prediction accuracy of the IE method is better than MB and
DDNA3. The P—Values for the three comparison metrics, Chi—
square, AKL divergence and Euclidian distance are 0.003, 0.003 and
0.048 between IE and MB predictions and 0.003, 0.005 and 0.025
between IE and DDNA3, respectively, suggesting that the improve—
ments are statistically significant.

Zinc fingers and homeodomains represent the two largest and
extensively studied TF families. In our non—redundant dataset, we
found six zinc finger chains (Fig. 5) and three homeodomains

(Fig. 6). Zinc fingers usually function as a dimer or multimers. A sin—
gle zinc finger domain typically contains three to four conserved rec—
ognition bases (Persikov and Singh, 2014). Three of the six zinc
finger cases (1LLM:C, 2DRP:A and 4F6M:A) show better binding
site prediction using the IE function, whereas the other three have
no significant differences (1DSZ:A, 4HN5:A and 4IQR:A, Figs 4
and 5).

Homeodomains are the second largest TF family (Tupler et (11.,
2001). Each homeodomain recognizes a variation of the typical
TAAT core binding site. There were three homeodomains in the
non—redundant dataset. Figure 6 shows the predicted binding motifs
and significant improvement in prediction accuracy when using the
IE function over the MB and DDNA3 statistical potentials. The
quantitative improvement is shown in Figure 4B. In all three cases,
predictions using the IE consistently outperform both MB and
DDNA3 potentials.

Homeodomain is a well—studied, highly conserved structural do—
main for DNA binding. As we have a relatively large number of high
quality homeodomain—DNA complex structures in the PDB and a
large number of experimentally derived homeodomain binding
motifs, we generated a larger dataset of homeodomains by combin—
ing the protein sequence similarity and binding site similarity as

Fig. 7. Prediction of homeodomain binding sites. (A) Quantitative comparison
between the predicted binding motifs and JASPAR motifs of the homeodo-
main dataset using the IE (blue), MB potential (red) and DDNA3 (green) using
AKL divergence. (B) Comparison of the predicted binding motifs

described in Section 2. Figure 7 shows the predicted binding motifs
using the IE (blue), MB (red) and DDNA3 (green) energy functions
and their accuracy when compared with the JASPAR motifs. The
data demonstrate that our new IE function can not only accurately
predict the binding sites of homeodomains with low sequence iden—
tity (Fig. 6), it can also accurately predict the binding sites of homeo—
domains with high sequence similarity but with different binding
sites (Fig. 7).

We also used a recently developed IC—weighted PCC method to
calculate the correctly predicted core—binding positions (PWM

that a reference column is correctly predicted if the IC—weighted
PCC between the corresponding predicted and reference columns is
at least 0.25 (Persikov and Singh, 2014). Figure 8 shows that ap—
proximately 93% of the core base positions (44 columns) are cor—
rectly predicted by the IE function, 86% by the MB potential and
63% by the DDNA3 potential. The columns predicted by the IE
function have a higher correlation to their corresponding JASPAR
columns than the MB and DDNA3 energy functions.

4 Discussion

We report here improved accuracy of structure—based TF binding
site prediction using an IE function. The IE function consists of the
MB potential (Liu et (11., 2005), and two atomic terms: hydrogen
bond energy and 1t interaction energy. The MB energy is a residue—
level knowledge—based protein—DNA interaction potential derived
from the mean force theory. Even though this MB potential impli—
citly captures biophysical interactions including hydrogen bonds
and 1t interactions and showed its predictive power in both TF bind—
ing site prediction and protein—DNA docking studies (Liu et (11.,
2005, 2008), the mean force nature and the typical low count prob—
lem limit its ability to accurately capture the key hydrogen bond and
TE interactions. For example, arginine has the ability to form biden—
tate hydrogen bonds, which allows it to bind specifically to guanine
because guanine has two hydrogen acceptors present in the major
groove of DNA. Bidentate hydrogen bonds are considered key con—
tributors to protein—DNA binding specificity (Luscombe et (11., 2001;
Seeman et (11., 1976). In the case of arginine and lysine, both can
contribute to specific (through simple and complex hydrogen bond—
ing) and non—specific (through electrostatic interactions) inter—
actions; however, knowledge—based potentials cannot differentiate
these two types of interactions. Therefore, adding explicit hydrogen
bond terms can improve the accuracy of TFBS prediction by distin—
guishing hydrogen bonds that contribute to specificity from other
interaction energies. We found that adding the explicit hydrogen
bond term to the MB potential improves the TFBS prediction accur—
acy of 1B8I:B and 1IC8:A in the homeodomain dataset (Fig. 9A), as
it captures the hydrogen bonds formed between arginine 258 and ly—
sine 273, respectively, and the guanine of the conserved G:C base
pair (Fig. 9B and C).

bond energy term improves the prediction accuracy of 1BSI:B and 1IC8:A
when compared with the MB energy. The increased prediction accuracy of
3RKQ:A has a major contribution from the n-interaction energy term. (B)
Physical interactions involving hydrogen bonds from arginine (1BSI:B), lysine
(1IC8:A) and a n-interaction involving tyrosine (3RKQ:A) with the conserved
G:C base pairs. (C) All-atom rendering of residue-base interactions showing
the hydrogen bonds (black dotted lines) between Ar9258 and guanine in
1BSI:B, between LysZ73 and guanine in 1IC8:A where the green, blue, red and
white atoms represent carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen, respectively.
Tyrosine 191 is involved in n-interaction with cytosine where the blue, red
and gray spheres represent partial positive, partial negative and neutral
charged atoms, respectively.

Aromatic residues can interact with DNA through it interactions
(Baker and Grant, 2007; Wilson et 41]., 2014). T—shaped it inter—
action with a base haVing partial positive charges in the major
groove can contribute to binding specificity because of the variations
of the electronic landscape of the bases in the major groove (Fig. 2).
However, these interactions are masked owing to the low count
problem and the mean force nature in knowledge—based potentials.
Adding an explicit TE interaction term increases the accuracy of TFBS
prediction. For example, the explicit it interaction term captures the
it interaction formed between tyrosine 191 and the cytosine in the
conserved G:C pair in 3RKQ:A (Fig. 9B), improving the TFBS pre—
diction accuracy. This suggests that the partial positively charged
atoms (large blue spheres in Fig. 9C) of cytosine interact electrostati—
cally with the partial negatively charged atoms (large red spheres in
Fig. 9C) in the aromatic ring of tyrosine 191, which may contribute
to TF—DNA binding specificity.

The IE function shows an overall improvement in TFBS predic—
tion over other knowledge—based potentials. However, in several
cases in the multi—family dataset, the IE function does not perform
as well as the MB and DDNA3 potentials (Fig. 4). We investigated

the complex structures and performed rigidity tests using FIRST
(Jacobs et 41]., 2001) and found that in those cases, the amino acids
that interact with the DNA were from ﬂexible regions or loops. For
example, in the STAT1—DNA complex (1BF5:A), the residues
involved in interacting with DNA are on the loops (Fig. 10). As dis—
cussed in the introduction, both hydrogen bonds and it interactions
are high—resolution functions that are sensitive to conformational
changes. For complex structures with highly ﬂexible regions for
DNA contacts, there is a large variation of interaction energies for
different conformations of the complex and the structure used for
prediction is just a snapshot of multiple possible conformations. In
addition, if a TF structure is not in an ideal docked conformation
and the amino acids do not have favorable torsion angles to achieve
favorable bidentate hydrogen bonds with the DNA, then the sensi—
tive physical energies may not help the prediction, which is the case
in 1NLW:A and 2UZK:A. Future work will need to incorporate the
ﬂexibility information into the prediction process.

5 Conclusion

We developed a novel IE function that consists of three components,
a knowledge—based MB potential, a hydrogen bond energy function
and an electrostatic potential for it interaction energy. We applied
the new IE function to the prediction of TFBSs. The results show an
overall improvement in binding site prediction, and there is a signifi—
cant improvement in predicting binding sites of homeodomains
when compared with the MB and DDNA3 potentials. The improved
accuracy using the integrative function demonstrates the importance
of considering hydrogen bonds and rt—interactions explicitly in
structure—based TFBS predictions, as they are not accurately cap—
tured by the knowledge—based potentials.

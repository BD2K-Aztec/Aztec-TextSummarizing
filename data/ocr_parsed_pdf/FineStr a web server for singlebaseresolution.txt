ABSTRACT

Summary: The DNA in eukaryotic cells is packed into the chromatin
that is composed of nucleosomes. Positioning of the nucleosome
core particles on the sequence is a problem of great interest because
of the role nucleosomes play in different cellular processes including
gene regulation.

Using the sequence structure of 10.4 base DNA repeat presented
in our previous works and nucleosome core DNA sequences
database, we have derived the complete nucleosome DNA
bendability matrix of Caenorhabditis elegans.

We have developed a web server named FineStr that allows users
to upload genomic sequences in FASTA format and to perform a
single-base-resolution nucleosome mapping on them.

Availability: FineStr server is freely available for use on the web at
http:/www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~nucleom. The site contains a help file with
explanation regarding the exact usage.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA accessibility plays an important role in the regulation of
processes such as transcription, replication, recombination and DNA
repair. DNA accessibility in turn depends on the chromatin structure,
of which the building blocks are nucleosomes.

It is generally accepted that the segment of DNA double
helix which is wrapped around the histone octamer forming
the nucleosome should possess sequence-dependent bendability
properties that would provide a stabilizing contribution to the free
energy of the nucleosome 3D structure.

We have discovered the sequence pattern characteristic for
nucleosome DNA of Caenorhabditis elegans and, apparently,
applicable to the nucleosomes of all eukaryotes (Trifonov, 2009;
Trifonov, 2010). As described in the cited work, the C. elegans pattern
is identical to the pattern uniquely deﬁned by DNA deformability
properties. In particular, it is dictated by minimization of unstacking
of DNA bases and base pairs in the nucleosome DNA. Accordingly,
we built a web server FineStr [pronounced as (ﬁ-nes’tru), from Latin
fenestra—window, and from ﬁne structure] that users worldwide

could use in order to map nucleosomes to genomic sequences of
interest with a single-base-resolution.

2 METHODOLOGY

Crystallography data suggest that nucleosome DNA sequence is
wrapped around histone octamer, having 12 close contacts of
oriented inward minor groove with arginines of the histories (Arents
et al., 1993; Harp et (11., 2000). That makes at least 11 periods of
DNA helix turns tightly wrapped around the octamer. To reveal the
full 11 periods bendability matrix, we used the previously published
10.4 base nucleosome DNA repeat sequence structure (Gabdank
et al., 2009) and nucleosome core DNA sequences database (Johnson
et al., 2006).

We concatenated the 10-matrix 11 times, placing the nucleosome
dyad axis on the base rather than on interbase (Davey et (11., 2002).
In order to make it we had to duplicate the central matrix element,
dinucleotide AT, and to place it in the positions —1 and 0, by that we
ensured preferential positioning of the dinucleotide in the positions
— l, 0 and 0, 1. Similarly the local dyads at the positions 26 and —26
we have duplicated the matrix element CG and at the positions 52
and —52 the AT dinucleotide. The base central local dyad positions
26 and 52 correspond to 2.5 and, respectively, ﬁve 10.4-base period
distances from the main dyad of the nucleosome DNA.

To accomodate the stretching/compression of nucleosome DNA
by l to 2 bases (Ong et al., 2007), we have derived two additional
matrices M_1 and M+1, by shifting the original matrix one base left
and right. Three matrices where combined to produce the Mcomb
matrix by choosing the maximal value for each position Mcombﬁ) =
maX{M—1(i)s M00), M+1(i)}.

The nucleosome mapping probe Mﬁnal was completed by
symmetrization of the combined matrix Mcomb. Values for
complementary dinucleotides (AA/T T, GA/TC and GG/CC) were
taken from the i-th (for any given dinucleotide XY) and (ll6-i)-th
positions (for its complementary dinucleotide), averaged and put
back in the i-th and (ll6-i)-th positions of the Mﬁnal. For the self-
complementary AT and CG dinucleotides, the symmetrized values
were calculated by averaging the values of the i-th and (ll6-i)-th
positions for the given dinucleotide.

The suitability of any DNA sequence to the bending in the
nucleosome structure can be evaluated using the probe Mﬁnal simply
by aligning the matrix with the sequence and summing the scores at
all 1 16 matrix positions. The ‘strength’ of the nucleosome that would
be formed by wrapping DNA with the given sequence on histone

octamer is measured from 0 to 1 as a ratio of the actual score to the
maximal possible score for the probe.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

All numerical calculations are performed with PHP code that uses
the complete bendability matrix data to perform the nucleosome
mapping on a given sequence. The presentation interface was
implemented using HTML and javascript on the client side and PHP
on the server side. In order to generate charts, we have used the GFlot
0.9.1 package.

Computational time (seconds) depends on the sequence length
presented to the server, and this length is currently limited to 10 000
letters to reduce the informational load on the clients’ browser that
is responsible for the presentation of the charts of the nucleosome
positioning predictions using javascript.

4 OPTIONS AND CONTROLS

The FineStr server web interface enables the user to submit the
sequences of interest for analysis either by pasting the sequences into
the text box or by uploading a ﬁle containing the sequences in FASTA
format. For each sequence submitted, the server generates the
nucleosome probe score distribution along the sequence, pointing
to the places with higher likelihood to place a nucleosome.

The server response includes a graphical representation of the
results (Fig. 1) and an option to download a ﬁle containing
the numerical representation of the results. The plot in Figure 1
displays a typical example of two nucleosomes mapped on sequence
chosen for the illustration purpose from the ﬁrst chromosome of
C.e1eg(1ns. Alternative nucleosome center positions are seen around
the central maxima. This corresponds to physical reality—sliding
of the nucleosomes to alternative positions with the same rotational
setting (Bao et (11., 2006).

5 RESULTS

Crystallography at atomic resolution at present time is the most
accurate way to map nucleosome position on the sequence.
Respectively, any other mapping technique to be tested should use
the crystallography data as reference.

In order to test our sequence-directed algorithm that uses the
nucleosome mapping probe, we took all known nucleosomes
crystallized with unique sequences, where the central base is
determined with atomic resolution. These are protein data bank
(PDB) structures: lAOI (Luger et (11., 1997), lEQZ (Harp et (11.,
2000), 1KX4, 1KX5 (Davey et (11., 2002) and 2NZD (Ong et (11.,
2007). Comparison of the nucleosome positions calculated by our
probe with the crystallography data showed an exact match within
:l:1 base.

6 FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

The software allows for modiﬁcations and extensions, e.g. expected
small species speciﬁc changes in the matrices. Another interesting
extension would be the incorporation of modiﬁed matrices that
can help in the detection of various ﬁmctionally active special
nucleosomes positions (e.g. epigenetic nucleosomes).

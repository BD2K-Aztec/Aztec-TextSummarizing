Abstract

Motivation: Next—generation sequencing (NGS) allows for analyzing a large number of viral
sequences from infected patients, providing an opportunity to implement large—scale molecular
surveillance of viral diseases. However, despite improvements in technology, traditional protocols
for NGS of large numbers of samples are still highly cost and labor intensive. One of the possible
cost—effective alternatives is combinatorial pooling. Although a number of pooling strategies for
consensus sequencing of DNA samples and detection of SNPs have been proposed, these strat—
egies cannot be applied to sequencing of highly heterogeneous viral populations.

Results: We developed a cost—effective and reliable protocol for sequencing of viral samples, that
combines NGS using barcoding and combinatorial pooling and a computational framework includ—
ing algorithms for optimal virus—specific pools design and deconvolution of individual samples
from sequenced pools. Evaluation of the framework on experimental and simulated data for hepa—
titis C virus showed that it substantially reduces the sequencing costs and allows deconvolution of
viral populations with a high accuracy.

1 Introduction

 

Next—generation sequencing (NGS) generates a large number of viral
sequences carried in samples of infected individuals, offering novel
prospects for studying microbial populations and understanding
pathogen evolution and epidemiology. NGS provides an opportun—
ity to implement a large—scale molecular surveillance of infectious
diseases for monitoring of disease dynamics and providing for
informed guidance for planning public health interventions.

Although NGS offers a significant increase in throughput, sequenc—
ing of viral populations from a large number of specimens is prohibi—
tively expensive and time consuming. Therefore development of a
strategy for rapid and cost—effective massive viral sequencing is a key
to effective molecular surveillance.

Owing to a high mutation rate, RNA viruses exist in infected
hosts as highly heterogeneous populations of genetic variants, which
are commonly referred to as quasispecies. Genetic viral variants can

be detected using highly variable subgenomic regions that can be
easily amplified and sequenced. Although genetic information pre—
sented in short subgenomic regions does not allow for identification
of all variants, it is sufficient for transmission networks inference
(Holodniy et (11., 2012; Wertheim et (11., 2014), study of drug resis—
tantce (Campo et 111., 20143; Dierynck et (11., 2014; Wang et (11.,
2014) and intrahost viral evolution (Culasso et (11., 2014; Palmer
et (11., 2012; Ramachandran et (11., 2011).

To reduce the cost of sequencing of multiple viral samples, multi—
plexing through barcoding is usually used. Although this is a
straightforward approach to a simultaneous sequencing of many
viral strains, it requires individual handling of each sample starting
from nucleic acid extraction to PCR and library preparation, which
increases the costs of sequencing per specimen (Duma et (11., 2013;
Lonardi et (11., 2013). Decoding of samples sequenced using large
libraries of barcodes may be highly affected by NGS errors (Deakin
et (11., 2014). Additionally, besides introduction of bias in amplifica—
tion of different viral variants using PCR primers with different
barcodes (that may affect distribution of reads) (Alon et (11., 2011
Duma et (11., 2013), maintaining a large library of barcodes is daunt—
ing (Duma et (11., 2013; Lonardi et (11., 2013).

An alternative strategy is combinatorial pooling. Commonly,
it was used for tests producing binary results (Berman et (11., 2004;
Du et (11., 2006; Wu et (11., 2006). Recently, several pooling strategies
were proposed for more complex assays based on DNA sequencing,
SNP calling and a rare alleles detection (Bansal, 2010; Erlich et (11.,
2009; Golan et (11., 2012; He at 111., 2011; Lonardi et (11., 2013;
Prabhu et (11., 2009; Shental et (11., 2010).

The pooling problem for viral quasipecies sequencing is funda—
mentally different from all existing pooling protocols. Previously de—
veloped methods assume that a single (consensus) sequence must be
reconstructed for each sample. In contrast, for viral quasispecies
sequencing it is imperative to reconstruct the whole population
structure of each sample that includes multiple sequence variants
and their frequencies. This problem formulation and the nature
of heterogeneous viral populations require a completely novel ap—
proach for pool design and deconvolution.

We propose a protocol for a cost—effective NGS of complex
viral populations, which combines barcoding and pooling and
includes the following steps (Fig. 1): (i) mixing samples in a spe—
cially designed set of pools so that the identity of each sample
is encoded in the composition of pools; (ii) sequencing pools using

barcoding; (iii) pools deconvolution (PD); i.e. assignment of viral
variants from the pools to individual samples. This approach signifi—
cantly minimizes the number of PCR and NGS runs, reducing the
cost of testing and hands—on time. Additionally, pooling provides
opportunity for PCR amplification of viral variants from each
sample in different mixtures of samples generated in each pool, thus
introducing variation in amplification biases and contributing to
sequencing of a more representative set of viral variants from
each sample.

Pooling—based sequencing of highly mutable viruses such as
human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is
particularly difficult because of the complexity of intrahost viral
populations, the assessment of which can be distorted by PCR or
sampling biases. It is essential to detect both major and minor viral
subpopulations, since the latter often have important clinical impli—
cations (Campo et 111., 20143; Metzner et (11., 2009; Skums et (11.,
2012b). Mixing of a large number of specimens or specimens with
significant differences in viral titers may contribute to underrepre—
sentation of viral variants from some samples in pools, suggesting
that size and composition of pools should be carefully designed.
Stochastic sampling from genetically diverse intra—host viral popula—
tions usually produces variability in compositions of sets of variants
in different pools obtained from the same sample. Additionally, mix—
ing specimens may differentially bias PCR amplification, contribu—
ting to mismatching between viral variants sampled from the same
host in two pools with different specimen compositions. Thus,
straightforward approaches cannot be used for samples deconvolu—
tion, indicating that a more complex approach based on clustering
techniques is needed. To increase the effectiveness of cluster—based
deconvolution and minimize possible clustering errors, it is import—
ant to minimize mixing of genetically close samples as can be
expected in epidemiologically related samples and samples collected
from a small geographic region.

In this article, we present the first computational framework
for combinatorial pool—based sequencing of highly heterogeneous
viral samples. The framework includes pools design and PD stages.
We formulate the pool design problem as an optimization problem
and propose a heuristic algorithm to solve it. We propose a method
for inference of samples from sequenced pools based on a novel
maximum likelihood clustering algorithm for heterogeneous viral
samples. We report the results of the framework evaluation using
simulated and experimental HCV data.

2 Methods
2.1 Pools design

The basic idea of the overlapping pools strategy for sequencing n
samples is to generate m pools (mixtures of samples) with m < n
in such a way that every sample is uniquely identified by the pools
to which it belongs (Prabhu et al., 2009). Then, after sequencing
of pools the obtained amplicon reads can be assigned to samples by
a sequence of set—theoretic intersections and differences of pools.
The unique assignment is only possible if for any two samples there
is a pool separating them, i.e. containing exactly one of those
samples.

Example. Consider 3 samples S1, 52, S3 and 2 pools P1 : S1 U 52,
P2 : Sz US3 (Fig. 2). These pools satisfy the separation require—
ment, and, therefore, each sample can be recovered, e.g.
$2 2 P1 ﬂP2,Sj 2 P1 \P2,anng : P2\P1.

Without constraints, n samples can be inferred using llog 
+1 pools (Theorem S1, also indirectly follows from Prabhu
et al., 2009). However, heterogeneous viral samples impose
restrictions on pools composition: (i) the number of samples per
pool should not be too high; (ii) samples with drastically different
viral titers or samples, which may be epidemiologically related,
should not be mixed together. These constraints make the pool
design problem computationally hard. We formalize the constraints
and formulate the pool design problem as an optimization problem
on graphs.

For a set of samples 8 : {S1, . . ., Sn} consider a samples compati-
hility graph G : C(S) with the vertex set V : V(G) and the edge
set E : E(G), such that V(G) : S and 5,5, 6 E(G) if and only if the
samples S,- and S,- could be mixed together. As aforementioned, infor—
mation on viral load, epidemiological linkage, geographic location,
age/social groups, time of infection, risk factors, etc. may be used to
determine compatibility of specimens. Every feasible pool is a clique
of the graph G. Let T be an upper bound for pools size. The problem
of optimal pool design for viral samples sequencing can be formu—
lated as follows:

Viral Sample Pool Design (VSPD) Problem: given a graph
G : (V, E) and T > 0, find a minimum set of cliques
73 : {P1, . . .,Pm} such that 1) u;:1P,- : V; 2) for every u,v E V there
is a clique P,- E 73 separating u and 1/; 3) (P,) S T for every
i : 1, . . ., m.

Due to the condition 2), at most one vertex 1/ E V(G) is not cov—
ered by a clique from 73. Thus, any family of cliques satisfying 2)

 

Fig. 2. Two pools for 3 samples: 81 has 3, 82 has 4 and 83 has 2 variants

and 3) can be forced to satisfy 1) by adding the single clique {1/}.
Therefore the condition 1) is not essential and can be dropped.
VSPD is NP—hard (Theorem S2), and we propose a heuristic
(Algorithm 1) for it. We consider a graph H with V(H) : V and
i/ E  if and only if the pair of vertices (i, j) is not separated yet.
Initially, H is a complete graph. For A Q V a cut in the graph H is
the pair (A, V\A), the size of the cut c(A, V\A) is the number of
edges with one end in A and the other end in V\A. At each iter—
ation, Algorithm 1 finds and adds to the solution a locally optimal
pool, i.e. a clique of G that separates the maximal number of non—
separated samples (see example in Supplementary Figure S2).

1: 73 <— 0); H <— complete graph on n vertices

2: while E(H) 9E 0 do

3: find a subset AX g V such that (AX) g T, AX is a
clique of the graph G and C(AX, V\AX) in the graph H

is maximal.
4: 73 <— PU{AX}
5: remove from H all edges uv with u E AX and
v e V\AX.
6: end while
7: return 73

 

 

 

The crucial step of Algorithm 1 is locally optimal pool finding
(step 3), which represents a previously unstudied discrete optimiza—
tion problem further referred as Locally Optimal Pool (LOP)
Prohlem. LOP is not approximable within the factor n1‘9 for any
a > 0 (Theorem S3), and it can be reformulated as follows: find a
partition X : (Ax , B x) of the set V minimizing the function

1‘00 2 C(Axle) -MlE(§lel)l (1)

subject to the constraint (Ax) S T. Here M :  + 1, C is a
complement of a graph G, and Cle] is the subgraph of 6 induced
by a set Ax. So,  Z 0 if and only if Ax is a clique. Therefore, for
any optimal solution of the problem (1), the set Ax is a clique.

We propose a heuristic to solve the problem (1). Initially,
we relax the constraint (Ax) S T. For a vertex 1/ E Ax consider the
solution X’ : (Ax,,Bx,) : (Ax \ {1/}, Bx U Then

A. : f(X’) — f(X) : deg§x<v> — deg‘g‘xw) + Mdegi. <2>

where deg  denotes the number of vertices from the set U E V
adjacent to 1/ in a graph H. In particular, if 1/ is non—adjacent to some
vertex u E Ax, then A1 > 0. For 1/ E Bx and the solution X’ : (Axl,
Bxl) : (Ax U {1/},Bx \  we have

A2 = f(X’) - 1‘00 2 deg E(v) - deg 10/) - Mdeg  (3)

According to (2) and (3), any initial solution can be iteratively
improved by moving vertices from one part of the partition to the
other until a locally optimal solution (A1, Bl) cannot be further im—
proved. According to (2), A1 is a clique. However, the objective func—
tion value in a local optimum may be significantly lower than the
value of the global optimum. It is also possible that c(A,,B,) : 0,
when  9E 0), which will cause Algorithm 1 to go into an infinite
loop. To overcome these problems we use a tahu search strategy.
The basic idea is that if after the moving of a vertex 1/ the algorithm
arrives at a local optimum, its value is compared with the current
best solution (A*,B*), 1/ is moved back and the moving of 1/ is

prohibited for the next l2t iterations. The process stops, when it
reaches a local optimum, which has been visited before with the
same configuration of the algorithm states. Finally, the set A" is
reduced to the allowed size. This idea is implemented in Algorithm 2
(see also Supplementary Figure S3). The default value of la, is 1.
If c(A* , B *) : 0, we increase l2t by one and repeat Algorithm 2.

2.2 Deconvolution of viral samples from pools
2.2.1 Deconvolution using generalized intersections and differences
Let 73 be the set of pools designed using Algorithm 1 and sequenced
by NGS. As aforementioned, the obtained reads theoretically can be
assigned to samples using set—theoretic intersections and differences
of pools. However, owing to the heterogeneity of viral populations
and sampling bias, individual viral variants and even viral subpopu—
lations sequenced from a certain sample may be different in each
pool containing that sample (see Supplementary Figure S1). It ham—
pers the usage of straightforward set—theoretic operations.

For a pool Pi, let S(P,-) be a set of IDs of samples mixed in it.
In particular, we consider each individual sample Rl- as a pool
with lS(R,-)l : 1. A generalized intersection (GI) of pools P1 and P2 is a
pool PlﬁP2 with 8(P1ﬁP2) : 8(P1) ﬂ 8 (P2), consisting of sequences
from P1 U P2 that belong to the samples from 8(P1) ﬂ 8(P2). A gener-
alized difference (GD) PlTP2 is a pool with 8(P1TP2) : 8(P1) \S(P2)
that contains sequences of the set P1 \ (P1ﬁP2).

Individual samples are inferred from pools by a sequence of
GIs and GDs (Algorithm 3). GDs reduce to GIs, which are calcu—
lated using a clustering—based approach (Algorithm 4). In some
cases, when samples with substantial difference in heterogeneity are
mixed together, highly heterogeneous samples can be partitioned
into multiple clusters, while samples with lower heterogeneity are
joined into one cluster. Such clustering may lead to incorrect detec—
tion of GIs and consecutive fail of samples separation. To avoid this
effect, the parameter W of Algorithm 4 with the default value
W : 2 is introduced. If certain samples are not found by Algorithm
3 (i.e. some sets from R are empty), we increase W and repeat
Algorithm 3.

2.2.2 Maximum Likelihood k-Clustering of viral samples

In this section, we consider Viral Sample Clustering (VSC) Problem:
given a set R of NGS reads drawn from a mix of k/ viral samples,
partition R into k : Wk’ suhsets consisting of reads from a single
sample. The presence of numerous variants, extreme heterogeneity
of viral populations and sequencing errors make VSC challenging.
Although a commonly used clustering objective is to minimize intra—
cluster distances or distance to cluster centers (e.g. the k—means
algorithm), we propose to use a statistically sound objective of maxi—
mizing likelihood. An input of our algorithm is a multiple sequence
alignment of R represented as a matrix with columns corresponding
to the consensus positions and rows corresponding to aligned reads.
Our model assumes that each read is emitted by a particular geno—
type. The proposed clustering (a) finds k genotypes G1, . . . , G’3 that
most likely emitted R; (b) assigns each read to a cluster correspond—
ing to a genotype that most likely emitted it.

Formally, given a set of reads C:, a genotype Gi : g(Ci) is a ma—
trix with columns corresponding to an alignment positions and 5
rows corresponding to the alleles {a, c, t, g, d}, where each entry
Géﬁm is a frequency of allele e in m—th position among all variants in
C. Given a set of reads R, an optimal k-genotype is a set 9* :{
G1, . . . , Gk} of k distinct genotypes that most likely emitted R:

G* : arg max HPr(rlg)°',

where Pr(r(g) : 21:1 ﬁPr(rlG') is the probability to observe read
r : (r1, . . . ,rm), or is its observed multiplicity,  is the frequency of
the genotype Gi and

The log—likelihood of the set of genotypes g equals to
[(G) : erRorlogPng). We iteratively estimate the missing data
f: and p:r (the frequency of genotype GI and the portions of reads ori—
ginated from G, that mathches r) using Expectation Maximization

2.3 NGS errors and sequencing failures processing
Before applying deconvolution algorithms, the data are preprocessed
to remove sequencing errors and PCR chimeras. Since errors may
be sample—specific, the following pipeline is used: (i) each pool is
partitioned into clusters using Algorithm 5; (ii) NGS error correction
algorithm is applied to each cluster. This algorithm is specific to
sequencing platform and sequenced species. (iii) Corrected reads
from each cluster are used to reinstate pools.

Failure to recover sequences from some samples within certain
pools may result in algorithm’s inability to separate these samples.
Given the aforementioned pools design constraints, use of appropri—
ate PCR conditions and high NGS throughput, we expect that the
probability of a complete loss of a sample within a pool is very low.
Nevertheless, if sequencing of some samples within certain pools
fails, the workﬂow summarized in Algorithm 6 allows to detect and
eliminate the negative effects of the failures.

2.4 Experimental pools and sequencing

Serum specimens collected from HCV—positive cases (Holodniy
et al., 2012) were used to sequence HCV HVR1 region. Seven sam—
ples S1, . . .,S7 were mixed to form 4 pools P1, . . .,P4 as follows: P1
was created by mixing samples S1,S2,S3, P2—S4, S5, S6, S7, P3—S1,
S4,S5 and P4—S2, S4, S6. Specimens and pools were sequenced
using 454 GS Junior System (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT).
Total nucleic acids extraction was performed using MagNA Pure
LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany) and reverse—transcribed using SuperScript
Vilo cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

HVR1 amplification was accomplished using two rounds of
PCR. For the lst round, regular region—specific primers were used.
Forward and reverse tag sequences consisting of primer adaptors
and multiple identifiers (MID) were added to the HVR1—specific
nested primers. Pools were processed as a single specimen, tagged
with a single MID. PCR products were pooled and amplified by
emulsion PCR using the GS FLX Titanium Series Amplicon kit, and
bi—directionally sequenced. The NGS reads were identified and sepa—
rated using sample—specific MID tag identifiers. Low quality reads
were removed using GS Run Processor v2.3 and the obtained data—
sets were processed using error correction pipeline with algorithms
KEC and ET (Skums et al., 2012a).

3 Results
3.1 Pools design

Pool design algorithm was evaluated using 3 sets of simulated data.

1) Complete graphs with n : 4,. . ., 1024 vertices and with
T : 00. For every test instance, exactly (log  + 1 pools were
constructed, coinciding with the theoretically justified estimation.
Hence, in this case Algorithm 1 produces optimal solutions.

2) Random graphs, where each vertex v receives a random titer
ulv E {1, L}, and two vertices u and v are adjacent, when
(urn — and g R. This family of instances represents titer compatihil—
ity model, i.e. it simulates the case when two samples could be
mixed together only if their viral titers are not sufficiently different.
25 000 test instances were generated with n : 10, . . ., 1000, L : 20
,R : 4 and with the pools sizes thresholds T : n, 55, 35, 25, 15.
For each n the mean reduction coefficient (the ratio of a number of
pools and a number of samples) was calculated (Fig. 3a). For
n : 1000 the reduction of the number of sequencing runs varies
from more than 21 for T : n to 6 for T : 15.

3) Random graphs, where each edge is chosen with probability
p : 0.25,0.5,0.75, 1 and pools sizes are bounded by T : 35.
20 000 test instances with n : 10,...,1000 were generated (Fig.
3b). A reduction of the sequencing runs number is also high, al—
though it is generally lower than in 2) (from ~13—fold reduction for
P : 1 to more than 3—fold reduction for P : 0.25, n : 1000).

The reduction coefficient in all these cases is a decreasing
function of n, which suggests a higher reduction for the larger n.

3.2 Pools deconvolution

3.2.1 Simulated pools of experimental data

450 test instances with n : 10, . . ., 150 samples and with pool sizes
thresholds T : 15, 25, 35 were generated using 155 HCV HVR1
samples from the collection of Centers for Disease Control (Campo
et al., 2014a,b; Dimitrova et al., 2012; Lara et al., 2012).
Samples were cleaned using KEC and ET (Skums et al., 2012a).
Test instances were generated as follows: (i) n samples were chosen
randomly; (ii) a random samples compatibility graph on n vertices
was generated based on the titer compatibility model and pools
were designed using Algorithm 1; (iii) pools were created by taking
D : 10 000 randomly selected reads from the samples composing
each pool (in order to simulate a sampling bias). The number
of reads per pool corresponds to the sequencing settings, under
which the data used for simulation were obtained [454 GS Junior
System (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT) with 8—10 MIDs per
sequencing run].

For all test instances all samples were inferred, i.e. all n data sets
produced by Algorithm 3 were non—empty. The number of reads,
which were not classified into samples was extremely low (Fig. 4a):
in average 99.996% of reads (T: 15), 99.993% (T: 25) and
99.984% (T : 35) were assigned. An overwhelming majority of
reads was classified correctly (Fig. 4b): in average, 99.998% for
T : 15, 99.982% for T : 25 and 99.959% for T : 35. There is no
clear correlation between percentages of classified and correctly
classified reads and the samples number.

We call an incorrect assignment of reads to samples in silico
contamination. The average percentage of samples without in silico
contamination ranges from 100 to 98.13% (T: 15), from 100
to 96.13% (T: 25) and from 100 to 93.8% (T : 35) (Fig. 4c).
In silico contaminants within contaminated samples in average con—
stitute 0.163% (T : 15), 0.545% (T : 25) and 0.892% (T : 35)
of all reads (Fig. 4d). Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of deconvo—
luted haplotypes frequencies estimation is in average 0.031—0.107%
(T : 15), 0.025—0.139% (T : 25) and 0.028—0.174% (T : 35)
(Fig. 4e). Both the percentages of in silico contaminated samples and
RMSE increase with n.

The accuracy of samples deconvolution is affected by the number
of allowed samples per pool. The algorithm is more accurate for
smaller pools, although the accuracy for larger pools remains high.
Working times of pools deconvolution are shown in Supplemetary
Figure S4.

To test failure detection and processing workﬂow, 150 test
instances with T : 15 were generated, where in addition to steps

(1)—(3) a random subset of up to 50% of pools was selected, and
in each of these pools all sequences originated from a random subset
of up to 25% of samples were removed. The instances were pro—
cessed by Algorithms 3 and 6 (resequencing was simulated by taking
sequences from the corresponding individual samples). For all test
instances all samples were inferred, and the quality of deconvolution
was comparable with the quality without failures (Supplementary
Figure S5).

3.2.2 Experimental pools

Experimental pools (Section 2.4) were deconvoluted using
Algorithm 3, and the obtained samples (further refered as
p-samples) were verified by comparison with the individually
sequenced samples (i—samples). 10 references were taken from each
i—sample, and the correctness of deconvolution was assessed by
finding the closest reference to each p—sample sequence. Sequences
were aligned using Muscle (Edgar, 2004).

In average, 259 unique haplotypes per p—sample were obtained,
which exceeds the numbers obtained in other studies after the stand—
ard sequencing using 454 Junior System and error correction (Bull
et al., 2011; Caraballo Cortes et al., 2013; Gregori et al., 2013).
In total 99.96% (5463 of 5465) of reads were correctly assigned to
samples. Two reads assigned to sample S7 showed a higher similarity
to a reference from S6. The subsequent analysis showed that these
reads are distant from S6 and S7 as well as from each other: min—
imum distance from these reads to haplotypes from S6 and S7 is 25
and 26, respectively, and the distance between them is 20, while the
mean distance among haplotypes of i—samples S6 and S7 is 3.64 bp
(std 1.21 bp) and 6.12 bp (std 5.25 bp), respectively. Therefore,
these two reads are likely to be sequencing artifacts.

In general, the percentage of haplotypes from i—samples found in
p—samples was not high (Fig. 5a), with an average of 14.66%.
However, when the frequencies of these haplotypes were considered,
the level of agreement was much higher, with an average total fre—
quency of 56.94% (Fig. 5b). In particular, all individually sequenced
haplotypes with frequencies 210% and 72.73% of haplotypes with
frequencies 25% were found in p—samples.

In general haplotypes from i— and p—samples cover the same
areas of the sequence space, although some branches are formed
by variants sequenced in only one of experiments (Fig. 6). The
differences between haplotype frequencies distributions for i— and
p—samples were measured using Jensen—Shannon Divergence (JSD)
and correlation coefficient (Corr) (Table 1). JSD varies from
0.15 (S1) to 0.65% (S7). A correlation between frequencies dis—
tributions is positive and statistically significant for all samples
except S7, in which a large cluster of variants was not detected by
the individual sequencing, but was found in the pooling experiment
(Fig.6).

Computational framework for NGS

4 Discussion

In this study, we present a novel computational framework for mas—
sive NGS of highly mutable viruses. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first pooling framework applicable for sequencing of viral
quasispecies, which takes into account extensive heterogeneity of
viral populations, the large number of distinct viral variants
sequenced from each sample and the effects of PCR and sampling
biases. The proposed strategy drastically reduces the cost of
sequencing per specimen (Supplementary Section S5), while still pro—
viding sufficient amount of information in support of molecular sur—
veillance and other applications of viral sequences in clinical and
epidemiological settings. The framework is applicable to viral agents
infecting humans and animals and, with further development of
experimental protocols, it should serve as a cost—effective foundation
for molecular surveillance of infectious diseases.

Ultra—deep sequencing of viral samples produces a wide range of
intrahost viral variants and allows for detecting even minor viral
subpopulations. Pooling of several specimens reduces the depth of
sequencing for each specimen, but this reduction is not detrimental,
since each specimen is usually used in more than one pool. As speci—
men is tested more than once, the number of sequenced variants
is increased, so representative sampling of viral subpopulations
infecting each patient can be improved. The experiments conducted
here showed that comparable subpopulations were recovered
from individual specimens and from pools, at least at the pooling
scale used in this study. Both individual sequencing and pooling
produce sequences covering approximately the same areas of the
sequence space, thus providing a consistent structure of a viral
population.

Repeat sampling from the same complex viral population often
results in poorly matched sets of sequences, thus presenting a signifi—
cant challenge to pools deconvolution. Such stochastic sampling
has a potential to diminish the effectiveness of pool—sequencing and
usefulness of the obtained sequences by impeding the correct alloca—
tion of sequences to samples, leaving some samples without
sequences assigned or allocating only a fraction of the sequences.
The clustering approach developed in this study significantly
improves assignment of sequences to samples and, thus, not only
substantially overcomes the aforementioned potential pitfalls, but
converts stochastic sampling into an advantage. Clustering also
eliminates the detrimental effect of NGS errors, since erroneous
reads tend to concentrate around correct haplotypes.

The sequencing cost and accuracy of deconvolution are two
major measures of quality of our framework. These two measures
are in conflict with each other: while increase in pool size improves
cost—effectiveness of sequencing by reducing the number of sequenc—
ing runs, it reduces accuracy of deconvolution. Considering that
deconvolution accuracy significantly depends on the genetic com—
plexity of intrahost viral populations, an optimal pool size should be
carefully selected for each virus and genomic region.

In conclusion, success of the pool—based sequencing of viral
populations depends to a significant degree on the efficacy of
sequence assignments and the risk of under—representation of
viral variants from some samples, owing to PCR and sample
biases. The pool design and clustering algorithms presented
here substantially minimize the detrimental effect of these biases
on the sequencing quality. Further reduction of the biases using
generalizations of error—correcting codes and optimization of experi—
mental conditions may further improve the strategy, facilitating
its application to molecular surveillance and study of infectious
diseases.

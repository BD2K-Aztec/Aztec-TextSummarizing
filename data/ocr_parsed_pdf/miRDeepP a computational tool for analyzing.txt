ABSTRACT

Motivation: Ultra-deep sampling of small RNA libraries by next-
generation sequencing has provided rich information on the
microRNA (miRNA) transcriptome of various plant species. However,
few computational tools have been developed to effectively
deconvolute the complex information.

Results: We sought to employ the signature distribution of small
RNA reads along the miRNA precursor as a model in plants to
profile expression of known miRNA genes and to identify novel
ones. A freely available package, miRDeep-P, was developed by
modifying miRDeep, which is based on a probabilistic model of
miRNA biogenesis in animals, with a plant-specific scoring system
and filtering criteria. We have tested miRDeep-P on eight small
RNA libraries derived from three plants. Our results demonstrate
miRDeep-P as an effective and easy-to-use tool for characterizing
the miRNA transcriptome in plants.

1 INTRODUCTION

miRNAs are an important Class of endogenous small RNAs that
regulate gene expression at the post-transcription level (Bartel,
2009). There has been a surge of interest in the past decade in
identifying miRNAs and proﬁling their expression pattern using
various experimental approaches (Wark et al., 2008). Most recently,
deep sequencing of speciﬁcally prepared low-molecular weight
RNA libraries has been used for both purposes in diverse plant
species (Fahlgren et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2008). A major drawback
of these efforts is the exclusive focus on mature miRNAs, the ﬁnal
gene product and ignorance of sequence information associated with
other parts of the miRNA genes. New strategies and tools are thus
highly desirable to analyze the increasingly available sequencing
data to gain insights into the miRNA transcriptomes.

Although miRNAs are only 20—24 nt long, they are processed
from longer, stem—loop structured precursors called pre-miRNAs
(Bartel, 2009). Maturation of miRNAs releases small RNAs derived
from different parts of the stem—loop structure with asymmetric
abundance. The program miRDeep employs a probabilistic model
of miRNA biogenesis in animals to score compatibility of the

nucleotide position and frequency of sequenced small RNA reads
with the secondary structure of pre-miRNAs (Friedlander et al.,
2008). However, two signiﬁcant differences in miRNA precursors
between animals and plants prevent straightforward adaptation of
miRDeep to the plant systems. First, plant pre-miRNAs are much
longer with more variable lengths. Second, more miRNAs in plants
belong to paralogous families with multiple members encoding
identical or near-identical miRNAs (Supplementary Materials 1
and 2). We have demonstrated that miRDeep modiﬁed with plant-
speciﬁc parameters is useful in analyzing the miRNA transcriptome
in the model plantArabidopsis (Yang et al., 2011). Here we describe
the improved package, called miRDeep-P, and its applications in
plants.

2 APPLICATION DESCRIPTION

2.1 Workﬂow of miRDeep-P

Based on ultra-deep sampling of small RNA libraries by next-
generation sequencing, miRDeep-P enables users to explore
expression patterns of annotated miRNA genes and discover novel
ones. Figure 1 illustrates the workﬂow of miRDeep-P. To run

miRDeep-P

 

this application, the reads should be preprocessed by removing
adapters, discarding reads <15 nt and parsing them into FASTA
format with their copy number recorded. With correctly formatted
input ﬁles, miRDeep-P maps the reads to the reference (either
genomic or transcriptomic) sequences using Bowtie (Langmead
et al., 2009). For a given mapped read, the optimal size of the
window from which to extract reference sequences for predicting
RNA secondary structure has been shown to be 250bp (Yang
et al., 2011). However, miRDeep-P contains a module for users
to empirically determine what window sizes to use in case a set
of validated miRNA genes is available (Fig. 1). The secondary
structures of the extracted reference sequences along with all reads
mapped to such sequences are processed by the miRDeep core
algorithm (Friedlander et al., 2008) with a plant-speciﬁc scoring
system (Supplementary Material 3). The output from the core
algorithm is then ﬁltered with additional plant-speciﬁc criteria based
on known characteristics of plant miRNA genes (Meyers et al.,
2008). The overall process quantiﬁes the signature distribution of
small RNA reads and thereby provides reliable information on the
transcription and processing of the pre-miRNAs. miRDeep-P uses
such information to effectively proﬁle the miRNA transcriptome
(Fig. 1).

2.2 Identiﬁcation of new miRNA genes

A major utility of miRDeep-P is to identify miRNA genes in
plant species without detailed annotation. As long as there is
sufﬁcient read coverage, quantiﬁcation of the signature small RNA
distribution along reference sequences will be effective in revealing
expressed pre-miRNAs from deeply sampled small RNA libraries.
An advantage of miRDeep-P is that it outputs not only sequences of
the putative miRNAs but also the stem—looped precursors and their
location in reference sequences, which can be used to distinguish
individual miRNA genes. Another advantage of miRDeep-P is that
it does not require a priori information on sequence homology to
known miRNA genes. This feature should be especially helpful to
study the large complements of species-speciﬁc miRNA genes in
plants (Fahlgren et al., 2007).

2.3 Determination of the expression status of
individual miRNA genes

A novel application of miRDeep-P is to assign expression status
to individual miRNA genes. Although normalized frequency of the
miRNA-matching reads can be used to estimate the expression level
of miRNA genes (Fahlgren et al., 2007), the short length of the
reads would mean cross-contamination among paralogous genes
due to sequence similarity is potentially an issue. In miRDeep-P,
this issue is overcome by quantifying the signature distribution
of reads along the entire length of the miRNA precursors. This
feature is especially useﬁil to determine the expression status of
paralogous miRNA genes that encode identical mature miRNAs.
Meanwhile, if multiple libraries prepared from different biological
samples (e.g. leaf, root, etc.) are employed, expression proﬁling of
individual miRNA genes can be achieved as well.

3 IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS

The miRDeep-P package was developed in Perl by combining
the core algorithm of miRDeep (Friedlander et al., 2008), the
mapping tool Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) and the Vienna
RNA package for predicting RNA secondary structure (Hofacker,
2003). Current version of miRDeep-P includes nine Perl scripts,
which can be executed sequentially in a command line environment.
All scripts have been tested on two Linux platforms, SUSE 10
and Fedora 14, and should work on similar systems that support
Perl. The miRDeep-P scripts and user manual can be obtained
from http://faculty.virginia.edu/lilab/miRDP/index.html as well as
http://sourceforge.net/proj ects/mirdp/.

miRDeep-P has been tested using eight small RNA libraries from
three plant species, Arabidopsis, rice and papaya. Both Arabidopsis
and rice are well annotated for miRNA genes while there is no
annotation in papaya (Grifﬁths-Jones, 2010). Based on these tests,
it has been shown the optimal window size for extract precursor
reference sequences is 250 bp for both dicot and monocot plants
(Yang et al., 2011). From the three Arabidopsis libraries, a total
of 108 expressed (90 annotated and 18 novel) miRNA genes were
detected. The two rice libraries yielded 158 annotated and 51 novel
miRNA genes. Results from Arabidopsis have been successfully
validated using other experimental approaches (Yang et al., 2011),
demonstrating the reliability of miRDeep-P. From the three papaya
libraries, we detected 104 putative expressed miRNA genes of which
56 are conserved in other plant species and 48 are novel, further
indicating that miRDeep-P is of broad use in plants.

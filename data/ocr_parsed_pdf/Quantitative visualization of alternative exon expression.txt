Abstract

Motivation: Analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA—Seq) data revealed that the vast majority of human
genes express multiple mRNA isoforms, produced by alternative pre—mRNA splicing and other
mechanisms, and that most alternative isoforms vary in expression between human tissues. As
RNA—Seq datasets grow in size, it remains challenging to visualize isoform expression across mul—

tiple samples.

Results: To help address this problem, we present Sashimi plots, a quantitative visualization of
aligned RNA—Seq reads that enables quantitative comparison of exon usage across samples or ex—
perimental conditions. Sashimi plots can be made using the Broad Integrated Genome Viewer or

with a stand—alone command line program.

RNA sequencing analyses revealed that most human genes are alter—
natively spliced, and that differential regulation of isoforms is wide—
spread across tissues (Wang et (11., 2008, Pan et (11., 2008). While
many genome browsers can display raw RNA sequencing (RNA—
Seq) reads, a quantitative visualization that conveys the abundances
of alternatively spliced isoforms has been missing. For example, the
popular UCSC Genome Browser can visualize RNA—Seq reads as
tracks from RAM files (Kent et (11., 2002), but does not make exon
inclusion levels readily apparent and comparable across samples.

1 Results

To visualize exon inclusion levels, we developed Sashimi plots (Katz
et (11., 2013). Given an input annotation of transcripts and spliced

alignments of reads from a sample, a region of interest is visualized
in a Sashimi plot using the following rules: (i) alignments in exons
are represented as read densities (optionally normalized by length of
genomic region and coverage), and (ii) splice junction reads are
drawn as arcs connecting a pair of exons, where arc width is drawn
proportional to the number of reads aligning to the junction (or to
the log of this number; Fig. 1A).

Sashimi plots take as input spliced alignments (in RAM format)
and gene model annotations in GFF format (Stein, 2010), available
from databases such as Ensembl or custom—made by user (Fig. 1B).
Two implementations of Sashimi plots are available: (i) stand—alone
command line implementation for making customizable publication—
quality figures, and (ii) an implementation built into the Integrated
Genome Viewer (IGV) browser (Thorvaldsdottir et (11., 2013),

Fig. 1. (A) Anatomy of a Sashimi plot. Gene model annotation containing two
isoforms differing by inclusion/exclusion of middle exon. Sashimi plot for the
two grey exons (blue boxed region) is shown, where genomic reads are con-
verted into read densities (per-base expression on y—axis) and junction reads
are plotted as arcs whose width is proportional to the number of reads
aligned to the junction spanning the exons connected by arc. Genomic coord-
inates are shown on X—axis. (B) Inputs required for making a Sashimi plot.
Gene model annotations (in GFF format), RNA-Seq read alignments (BAM
format) and optionally isoform expression estimates (by MISO) are used to
make Sashimi plots. Sashimi plots can be made with a stand-alone program
that makes customizable publication quality figures, or dynamically from the
IGV browser

IGV—Sashimi, which enables dynamic creation of Sashimi plots for
any genomic region of interest, suitable for exploratory analysis of iso—
form usage across experiments (Fig. 1B). Isoform expression estimates
generated by the MISO algorithm (Katz et (11., 2010) are optionally
plotted in Sashimi plots. Sashimi plots can visualize alternative splic—
ing for use in figures, or for rapid surveying of genomic regions for dif—
ferential isoform usage across multiple samples.

A Sashimi plot generated by the stand—alone program for four
RNA—Seq samples is shown in Figure 2A. Samples are color—coded
by condition, with RNA—Seq samples from wild type mice in red and
mouse heart tissues depleted for the splicing factor Muscleblind1
(‘heartKOa’, ‘heartKOb’) in orange. Read densities across exons are
normalized to obtain a measure of expression, like RPKM or similar
measures that incorporate library size and length of transcripts.
Single—end junction reads are plotted as arcs that are optionally
annotated with the raw number of junction reads present in each
sample, alternative isoforms from the input annotation are shown at
bottom. The plot in Figure 2A highlights the differential splicing of
the middle exon, which appears to be predominantly included in the
wild type samples but mostly excluded in the knockout samples.
This difference is confirmed by the MISO estimates for the inclusion
of the exon (Fig. 2B), which indicate that inclusion levels for the
exon [quantified as ‘Percent Spliced In’ or ‘P, as in (Katz et (11.,
2010)] is ~77% in wild type samples and only ~25% in the knock—
out samples. Users can customize the scales, colours, labels and
other features of the plot through a text settings file.

For comparison, UCSC visualization of the same data used to
generate the Sashimi in Figure 2 is shown in Supplementary Figure
S1 (using ‘dense’ and ‘squish’ views). While the ‘dense’ view is com—
pact (Supplementary Fig S1A), it does not present a quantitative
measure of exon inclusion levels. The ‘squish’ view by contrast is
too detailed for the task, as each read is plotted (Supplementary Fig.
S1B). Finally, tracks corresponding to samples with more coverage

Fig.2. (A) Sashimi plot (stand-alone) for alternatively spliced exon and flank-
ing exons in four samples (colored by experimental condition). Per-base
expression is plotted on y-axis of Sashimi plot, genomic coordinates on x-
axis, and mRNA isoforms quantified are shown on bottom (exons in black,
introns as lines with arrow heads). (B) Optional display of isoform expression
information produced by MISO. Posterior distributions over ‘1’ values are
shown as histograms (‘1’ values on x-axis, frequency on y-axis). (C) Genomic
region of interest in IGV along with two alignment tracks (top). (D) Sashimi
plot for region shown in (C). Genomic coordinates are plotted on x-axis and
read density (whose value is configurable via IGV) on y-axis

get allocated more space in the ‘squish’ view, making it challenging
to visualize multiple samples.

An IGV—Sashimi plot for the genomic region containing the same
alternative exon is shown in Figure 2C—D with one wild type heart
sample shown in red and one knockout heart sample in blue. The
GFF annotation of the alternatively spliced exon is shown in the
lower panel, and RefSeq canonical transcripts for the gene are
shown above. The boundaries of the Sashimi plot are determined by
the region of interest shown in the IGV browser window, and can be
altered to include more or fewer exons using the zoom in/out feature
of the browser. The raw junction read counts are shown on top of
each junction arc in Figure 2D. IGV—Sashimi combines the compact—
ness of a Sashimi plot with the versatility of a genome browser.

Genomic features apart from expression can be integrated into
Sashimi plots either programmatically or as tracks through the IGV
browser. The Sashimi plot code is freely available (accessible via
GitHub), and can be used to combine isoform and exon expression
levels with other genomic data. This code was recently extended to
display splicing Quantitative Trait Loci (‘sQTL’) alongside geno—
typic information (Wu et (11., 2014).

The advent of significantly longer, high—throughput RNA—Seq
reads can enable exact identification of some isoforms. Sashimi plots
may then be used to display other features related to exon/junction
usage, such as sQTLs. While extensible, Sashimi plots can become
cluttered or hard to interpret in cases of complex alternative splic—
ing, for genes that have tens or hundreds of expressed isoforms. It re—
mains a challenge for future work to distill RNA—Seq data from such
genes into quantitative and interpretable visualizations.

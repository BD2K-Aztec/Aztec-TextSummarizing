3 IMPLEMENTATION

PPfold 3.0 has been written in Java 6 and consists of a single jar
file. In addition to added support for experimental data, PPfold
version 3.0 also features an intuitive graphical user interface. An
arbitrary number of experimental data tracks can be added to
each prediction. The following types of data tracks are currently
supported:

(1) Probing data can be given in the same format as in
RNAstructure (Mathews et al., 2004). The distributions
P(H|a) must also be given as histograms; a default distri—
bution for SHAPE data is included in the application.

(2) ‘Hard’ constraint data can be specified for a sequence in
the alignment in the same format as in mfold (Markham
and Zuker, 2008).

(3) Advanced data tracks are also supported, where the
P(H,~|i paired) and P(H,~|i unpaired) values are pre—
computed by the user for some positions i of the sequence.

4 TESTING

We obtained SHAPE data for the Escherichia coli 16S and 23S
rRNAs from the authors of Deigan et a]. (2009) (personal com—
munication), removed invalid data points and computed the
P(H|a) distribution histograms for paired and unpaired nucleo—
tides at a resolution of 0.01 units. SHAPE data are currently only
available for few sequences with known structures, so we used
the data for the E. coli 16S rRNA for testing.

PPfold 3.0 is designed for structure prediction based on align—
ments. Nevertheless, the accuracy of single—sequence structure
prediction for the E. coli 16S rRNA sequence is greatly improved
on the addition of SHAPE data and is comparable to that of
RNAstructure (Table 1, upper block).

We also examined the effect of SHAPE data on the quality of
predictions of various alignments: (a) a Clustal W2 sequence
alignment of the highly divergent small ribosomal subunit
(SSU) sequences from E. coli (accession number K00421) and
Encephalitozoon cuniculi (accession number X98467); (b) an
R—coffee RNA alignment of the same two sequences; (c) the
‘SSU high similarity’ alignment from BRaliBase II (Gardner
and Giegerich, 2004) and (d) the ‘SSU medium similarity’ struc—
tural alignment from BRaliBase II.

SHAPE data improved the quality of structure predictions for
all alignments (Table 1, lower block). The highest quality predic—
tions can be obtained when a high—quality alignment is combined
with experimental data. In these cases, prediction accuracies
exceed what has been observed for a single sequence with
RNAstructure with additional data, or with PPfold without add—
itional data. However, a single—sequence structure prediction
using experimental data is more accurate than a prediction
using a low—quality sequence alignment alone or in combination
with experimental data. The quality of the input alignment must
therefore still be considered when using PPfold 3.0.

PPV: positive predictive value; true positives as a fraction of predicted pairs.
Sensitivity is the true positives as a fraction of reference base pairs. True positives
are the correctly predicted base pairs. F—measure: the harmonic mean of PPV and
sensitivity, and provides a measure for overall accuracy.

In conclusion, PPfold 3.0 enables phylogenetic RNA second—
ary structure prediction in conjunction with experimental data
and has the potential of producing highly accurate predictions.

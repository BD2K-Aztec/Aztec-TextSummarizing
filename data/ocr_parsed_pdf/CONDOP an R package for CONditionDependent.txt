Abstract

Summary: The use of high—throughput RNA sequencing to predict dynamic operon structures in pro—
karyotic genomes has recently gained popularity in bioinformatics. We provide the R implementation
of a novel method that uses transcriptomic features extracted from RNA—seq transcriptome profiles
to develop ensemble classifiers for condition—dependent operon predictions. The CONDOP package
provides a deeper insight into RNA—seq data analysis and allows scientists to highlight the operon 0r—
ganization in the context 0ftranscripti0nal regulation with a few lines of code.

Availability and Implementation: CONDOP is implemented in R and is freely available at CRAN.

1 Introduction

Transcriptome profiling of bacterial organisms by high-throughput
RNA-seq can be used to predict operon structures. We have recently
proposed a new computational strategy that integrates RNA-seq tran-
scriptome profiles with DNA-sequence based information to accur-
ately predict operons in a condition/transcriptome-specific manner
(Fortino et (11., 2014). Our method is capable of highlighting significant
changes occurring in the operon map annotated in the DOOR data-
base (Mao et (11., 2008) in specific dynamic conditions assayed at the
transcriptome level by RNA-seq. To this end, an ensemble classifica-
tion system employing genomic and transcriptomic features, is trained
to distinguish operon pairs (OPs) from non-operon pairs (NOPs).

The ensemble classifier is based on three different machine-
learning approaches: Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector
Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests (RFs). The training of each
model is based on a small set of OPs and NOPs that are systematic-
ally selected from the RNA-seq transcriptome profile and considered
as gene pairs with a known operon status. The trained models are fi-
nally used to predict (or re-define) the operon status of the gene
pairs that are excluded from the training and validation steps,
namely Door Operon Pairs (DOPs), and those that are not anno-
tated as operon pairs in the DOOR database, namely Putative
Operon Pairs (POPs). The ensemble classification system is

implemented with a simple majority-voting schema that combines
the classification predictions of all the trained models. After re-
classifying the adjacent gene pairs, a linkage process is compiled to
find adjacent genes predicted as OPs and group them into operons.
This process generates a new operon map namely condition-
dependent operon map. Here we present the R software package
CONDOP, an implementation of this method freely available at
(IRAN (https://cran.r-project.org).

2 Description

CONDOP requires four data inputs, namely (i) GFF file (.gff) - repre-
senting gene/feature annotations, (ii) DOOR file (.opr) — containing
non condition-dependent operon annotations retrieved from the
DOOR database, (iii) the genome sequence of the target organism
(.ftlsttl) and, (iv), a raw count table extracted from a specific RNA-seq
transcriptome profile. The raw count table must correspond to a data
frame having two columns (or coverage vectors) indicating the read
depth value for each genomic position on the forward and reverse
strand respectively. These files are given in input to the function pra-
proc() that accomplishes the following tasks: (i) it removes coverage
depth from a user-specified type region (e.g. rRNA, tRNA, etc.), (ii) it
quantifies the transcription abundance (RPKM values) for the coding

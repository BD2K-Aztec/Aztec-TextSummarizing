ABSTRACT

Motivation: Intrinsically disordered regions are key for the function
of numerous proteins. Due to the difficulties in experimental dis-
order characterization, many computational predictors have been
developed with various disorder flavors. Their performance is generally
measured on small sets mainly from experimentally solved structures,
e.g. Protein Data Bank (PDB) chains. MobiDB has only recently started
to collect disorder annotations from multiple experimental structures.
Results: MobiDB annotates disorder for UniProt sequences, allowing
us to conduct the first large-scale assessment of fast disorder
predictors on 25 833 different sequences with X-ray crystallographic
structures. In addition to a comprehensive ranking of predictors,
this analysis produced the following interesting observations. (i)
The predictors cluster according to their disorder definition, with a
consensus giving more confidence. (ii) Previous assessments appear
over-reliant on data annotated at the PDB chain level and performance
is lower on entire UniProt sequences. (iii) Long disordered regions are
harder to predict. (iv) Depending on the structural and functional types
of the proteins, differences in prediction performance of up to 10% are
observed.

1 INTRODUCTION

The rigid structure of proteins has been considered the determin-
ant of function for many years. Recently, an alternative View
is emerging with respect to non-folding regions, suggesting
a reassessment of the structure-to-function paradigm (Dunker
and Obradovic, 2001; Schlessinger et al., 2011; Wright and
Dyson, 1999). Flexible segments lacking a unique native struc-
ture, known as intrinsic disordered regions (Tompa, 2002), are
widespread in nature, especially in eukaryotic organisms

(Dunker et al., 2000). These regions have been shown to play
important roles in various biological processes such as cell
signaling or regulation (Dunker et al., 2002), DNA binding
and molecular recognition (Tompa et al., 2009). Their malleable
properties allow multiple binding partners (Dosztanyi et al.,
2006) with the ﬂexible region often becoming folded on binding
(Wright and Dyson, 2009).

Despite an emerging consensus regarding their existence, there
is no single deﬁnition of disorder. As a result, various ﬂavors
of disorder have been proposed (V ucetic et al., 2003). These
disorder ﬂavors have become diverse with some based on
amino acid composition (Vucetic et al., 2003), ﬂexibility
(Martin et al., 2010) and functional roles coupled with conser-
vation (Bellay et al., 2011). Perhaps the simplest ﬂavor
distinction is the length of a disordered region, separated into
short and long. Long regions seem to behave differently (Mohan
et al., 2009) and are difﬁcult in structural determination, causing
them to be underrepresented in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
(Rose et al., 2013). The PDB contains structural information
from X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy, which can be used indirectly to study
disorder. A plethora of computational predictors have also
appeared, with special efforts to capture different ﬂavors.
Available methods can be broadly divided into three
classes: biophysical, machine learning and consensus based.
Biophysical methods (Dosztanyi et al., 2005; Galzitskaya et al.,
2006; Linding et al., 2003a; Prilusky et al., 2005) derive pseudo-
energy functions from residue pairings in rigid structures
(i.e. non-disorder) to recognize sequence regions with high
energy as disordered. Machine learning, especially neural
networks, has been widely used to predict protein disorder
(Eickholt and Cheng, 2013; Hirose et al., 2007; Ishida and
Kinoshita, 2007; Linding et al., 2003b; Walsh et al., 2011,
2012; Ward et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2005). Many are tuned
for the disorder style used in the Critical Assessment of tech-
niques for protein Structure Prediction (CASP), where the goal
is to detect missing residues in the X-ray crystal (Monastyrskyy
et al., 2014). Others attempting to move away from this disorder
style measure some form of protein backbone ﬂexibility.
For example, ESpritz (Walsh et al., 2012) can predict
mobile NMR regions and DisEMBL (Linding et al., 2003b)
loops regions with high B-factor (high ﬂexibility). The most
recent disorder predictor category uses a consensus of various

biophysical and machine learning methods (Ishida and
Kinoshita, 2008; Mizianty et al., 2010; Schlessinger et al., 2009;
Walsh et al., 2011; Xue et al., 2010). Consensus approaches are
frequently more accurate, but at the computational cost of
running several predictors in parallel and averaging their
output. Because there is no consensus on how to define disorder,
predictors often vary in their parameter setting and disorder
output. In nearly all cases, disorder is deﬁned at the residue
level, and the goal of the predictor is to maximize recovery of
correct residues.

Among applications of disorder prediction, we can distinguish
at least two different scenarios. The ﬁrst is the CASP experiment
(Monastyrskyy et al., 2014), i.e. methods are used to predict a
relatively small number of proteins with maximum accuracy and
consensus predictors aiming for maximum accuracy should
clearly excel. A more practical scenario is represented by
high-throughput analysis of protein disorder on entire genomes
(Schlessinger et al., 2011). Over the years, most prediction
methods have addressed the first problem, with comparatively
little attention to the practicalities of large-scale predictions
(Walsh et al., 2012). MobiDB (Di Domenico et al., 2012) is a
large-scale disorder database containing experimental informa-
tion on the entire PDB and predictions for all UniProt
(The UniProt Consortium, 2012) sequences. Here, we use the
vast quantity of disorder data for a ﬁrst large-scale assessment.
While most assessments are performed with hundreds or a few
thousand examples, we have analyzed >25 000 UniProt
sequences combining all available X-ray crystallographic struc-
tures. All disorder assessments so far are carried out on single
PDB chains, whereas here the UniProt sequence is the ﬁnal
target. The UniProt annotation is unique and we compare it
with standard PDB chain analysis for further insights.

2 METHODS

2.1 Datasets and classiﬁcations

All UniProt (The UniProt Consortium, 2012) sequences with at least one
X-ray annotation in MobiDB (Di Domenico et al., 2012) were down-
loaded on the May 13, 2013 (25833 entries). Where more than one
MobiDB annotation was available, a majority vote was used (Fig. 1) to
produce a more stable disorder deﬁnition, ﬁltering rare conﬂicts due
to experimental conditions. Where MobiDB cannot ﬁnd annotation for
part of the UniProt sequence, residues are annotated as unknown and
ignored. Each PDB (Rose et al., 2013) chain that covered UniProt entries
was also extracted for comparison and identical chains majority voted
(Fig. 1). Similar chains were removed at 90% pairwise sequence identity
using CD-HIT (101338 chains reduced to 24 669). See Table 1 for stat-
istics. Each UniProt entry was assigned to CATH using SIFTS (Velankar
et al., 2013). Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Ashburner et al., 2000) were
downloaded from UniProt and expanded to the ontology root. For a
deeper analysis, the UniProt dataset was further split according to the
following rules (Supplementary Table S1): removing short (<30 residue)
PDB fragments, excluding conﬂicting residues, up to 10 non-consecutive
disordered residues, >10 disordered residues.

2.2 Predictors

Predictors were selected with the condition that they must be available
as an executable and fast, ideally returning predictions in <1 min.
The following 11 programs were used (disorder deﬁnition used in paren-
thesis): ESpritz (X-ray, NMR and DisProt; Walsh et al., 2012), IUPred

465; Linding et al., 2003b), RONN (X-ray; Yang et al., 2005) and VSL2b
(combination of X-ray and Disprot; Peng et al., 2006), GlobPlot (globu-
larity; Linding et al., 2003a) and FoldIndex (folding; Prilusky et al.,
2005). This resulted in a total of 11 predictors with different disorder
ﬂavors. A short description of the predictors is given in the
Supplementary Material. Predictor similarity was calculated on their
residue scores (e.g. probability of disorder) was shown as a dendogram
based on SOV performance. Low-complexity regions are parts of the
sequence with strongly biased compositions (e.g. polyQ), which are
thought to correlate with intrinsic disorder (Romero et al., 2001).
The low-complexity predictors SEG (Wootton, 1994) and Pﬁlt (Jones
and Swindells, 2002) were used both as disorder predictors and to analyze
disorder predictor performance in low-complexity regions.

2.3 Performance assessment

Disorder prediction is a binary classiﬁcation problem. As such, the stand-
ard measures accuracy, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, Matthews Correlation
Coefﬁcient (MCC) and area under the curve (AUC) are used
(see Supplementary Material). All these measures are calculated both
per residue and as average on a per protein basis. MCC and AUC were
replaced by SOV and FPreg in the per protein analysis. SOV is the
mean of the segment overlap for disorder and structure, in analogy

to secondary structure (Zemla et al., 1999). FPreg counts the number of
predicted false-positive disordered regions. Disorder content measures
the ability to recover the fraction of disordered residues in a protein
independent of residue position. We adopted two previously used meas-
ures (Mizianty et al., 2011), root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson
Correlation Coefﬁcient (PCC), with predicted and observed disorder
content normalized by the number of annotated residues. As a large
number of measures hinders a global View of performance, we established
an overall ranking as the average over all 12 quality measures. The Welch
t-test was used to compute statistical signiﬁcance.

3 RESULTS

3.1 First large-scale disorder assessment

We report the ﬁrst large-scale assessment of disorder predictions
on UniProt sequences through a comprehensive assessment of
11 fast predictors with new performance measures and a statis-
tical evaluation. With respect to diversity, the UniProt set has
15942 unique clusters at 40% identity cutoff. The 24 699 PDB
chains are non-redundant by design (see Methods). Therefore,
in both sets there is no large cluster of similar sequences, guar-
anteeing no bias in the analysis.

Figure 1 shows human P53 sequence (UniProt ID: P04637)
covered by different disorder and structure definitions from the
PDB. Using the majority voting approach, all structural and
disorder information is combined and a more reliable global
picture of the full p53 complex is constructed. Table 1
shows the number of proteins and residues using this annotation
strategy. A total of 25833 UniProt entries are annotated and
a dataset of unique PDB chains is constructed for comparison
purposes. For all sets, there is a clear imbalance between disorder
and structured residues. Similar to the CASP10 experiment
(Monastyrskyy et al., 2014) where 20% of the data was
completely ordered, 6271 sequences 24.3% of the UniProt
dataset are completely ordered. Long disordered regions
(>20 residues) are also abundant with 3439 examples.

Table 2 shows the per-residue performance on the UniProt
dataset. Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 show similar results
when excluding short PDB fragments and conﬂicting positions.

Table 3. UniProt per-protein and content performance

The same trends are also found when separating the UniProt
dataset for disorder content (see Supplementary Tables S5 and
S6 and Section 3.4 below). Table 3 shows the per protein and
disorder content performance. Most predictors have disorder
scores signiﬁcantly above random (AUCs >70). Depending on
the prediction style, e.g. high coverage (overprediction) or highly
conﬁdent (underprediction), one could argue for and against
different predictors. For example, VSL2b has a lower residue
speciﬁcity (81.16) predicting many false positives (1268274
residues), yet its AUC is the highest. On the contrary,
IUPred-short has the best MCC (31.43) due to its high speciﬁ-
city. Table 2 can reveal detailed future objectives such as the need
to retune the VSL2b decision threshold for higher speciﬁcity. For
the SOV measure, DisEmbl-465 has the best performance
(50.23). FPreg measures overprediction on segments as opposed
to single residues. Again VSL2b clearly over predicts compared
with DisEmbl-465.

more observations could be made, for the sake of brevity a
summarized ranking was chosen to give a clearer performance
summary. Before ranking, it is important that the measures are
evaluating different aspects of the predictions. Figure 2 shows
that no measure correlates highly and most are diverse (pairwise
correlation value >0.7 or <70.7 in only 9 of 66 cases). This
diversity ensures the ranking procedure is fair. Interestingly,
per-residue MCC correlates highly with both disorder content
measures (4)7 with RMSD and 0.9 with PCC), suggesting
they could be captured effectively by residue-level MCC. Both
were kept because they are not completely redundant and the
content measures do not depend on residue positions. From
Figure 3, the top-ranked predictors are DisEmbl-465 and
IUPred-short, with no statistically signiﬁcant difference between
performance (P—Value 0.64). A second group consists of Espritz-
NMR, VSL2b and Espritz—X-ray. In Supplementary Figure S2,
these top five predictors are analyzed using receiver operating
characteristic curves at low (L5% false-positive rates (FPR).
VSL2b starts outperforming the rest at around 2% FPR, again
suggesting high-quality residue scores but a need for recalibra-
tion of its decision threshold.

Combining several good but complementary predictors is the
heart of most consensus methods. Figure 4 shows the Pearson
correlation between predictors. Examining similarity and
performance is the ﬁrst step in designing a consensus. Both are
not necessarily related, e.g. IUPred-short, IUPred-long and
RONN form a group of highly correlated predictors (PCC
range 0.7418) with different performances. Figure 5 shows a
dendrogram of predictors grouped by SOV. This SOV difference
of correlated predictors is mainly due to their selected decision
threshold with residue scores remaining similar. Three methods,
FoldIndex, GlobPlot and DisEmbl-HL correlate poorly
with all others (PCC<0.5) and also perform poorly on SOV.

useful in certain situations.

IUPred-short and DisEmbl-465 have high correlation
(>0.7 PCC) in conjunction with similarly high SOV, suggesting
they detect the same disordered regions well. For a consensus
approach, however, it is more interesting to combine, for
example, Espritz—NMR/X-ray with DisEmbl-465, as they have
low correlation (PCC 0.5) and quality SOV. To investigate
consensus further, we measure agreement among predictors.

4e7 predictors because the accuracy continually decreased
below 61.2% (see Supplementary Fig. S3). When there is confi-
dent agreement, accuracy increases as expected, i.e. both tails of
Supplementary Figure S3: 073 structure and 8711 disorder
agreement. In these regions, a consensus can recover 88.8 and
24.5% highly conﬁdent structured and disordered residues,
respectively. Applying a simple majority vote in analogy to
secondary structure (Albrecht et al., 2003) produced 43.3%
sensitivity, 95.6% speciﬁcity and an AUC of 78.8 per residue
(see Table 2 for comparison).

3.3 Uniprot versus PDB chains

The most surprising result is the large decrease in performance
compared with previously published performances. As most of
the assessments in the literature are based on PDB chains, we
examine whether assessments on PDB chains behave differently
from UniProt sequences. Figure 7 shows the per-residue AUC
differences between the UniProt and PDB chain datasets. Most
predictors perform better on PDB chains and start approaching
their published values (e.g. ESpritz-X-ray AUC 86.58 on
CASP9). This is possibly due to the fact that predictor param-
eters are optimized on PDB chains. Another possible reason may
be the positional dependence in PDB sequences, i.e. missing
atoms or disordered residues in solved structures are often
located at the N and C termini. This effect was recently noted
for CASP-10 (Monastyrskyy et al., 2014). Given that most
methods encode the sequence context (e. g. using sliding windows
in neural networks) they will implicitly learn the position of the
termini. This information is lost when the PDB sequence is
assigned to a part, often the middle, of the UniProt sequence.
Moreover, the deﬁnition is different in UniProt because it
is a majority combination of multiple experimental sources.

3.4 Sequence and structure variability

Fluctuations in performance given different protein properties
are often overlooked. To our knowledge, this has never been
examined comprehensively. In all cases, performance is assessed
using SOV and there are indeed some striking performance dif-
ferences. Proteins are grouped into bins of low complexity con-
tent (1% intervals), and the top five predictors are analyzed for

proteins

performance changes in Supplementary Figure S4. Increasing
low complexity content increases SOV logarithmically with the
largest gains in the 5720% low complexity range. A similar
concept was already investigated (Romero et al., 2001), suggest-
ing that disorder predictors are generally using low complexity
patterns to predict unstructured regions. At ﬁrst glance, this
seems to contradict Table 2, which shows SEG and Pﬁlt produ-
cing almost random predictions. It can be explained by the fact
that no low complexity regions were detected for 40.1% of the
disordered proteins. From Supplementary Figure S4 it is clear
that low complexity has a signiﬁcant relationship with disorder
performance whenever present.

Disorder region length is perhaps the most obvious sequence
property, and the majority (75.8%) of sequences in our dataset
contain at most 10 disordered residues (Supplementary Fig. S5).
The performance separated on this threshold is shown in
Supplementary Tables S5 and S6. This skewed distribution
may not reﬂect the truth in nature, especially for long proteins
where long disordered regions may be missed owing to lack of
evidence, but is nevertheless interesting, as we are using a
common disorder deﬁnition (Monastyrskyy et al., 2014).
Figure 8 shows the performance of each method separated into
two sets. Proteins containing at least one long disorder stretch
(i.e. >20 residues) or not. Detection of disorder with long regions
had a decreased performance in 5 of 11 methods, but 4 of these
were the top ranked ones. Conversely, methods trained to take
into account long disorder (e.g. IUPred-long, Espritz—Disprot,
RONN and VSL2b) and the folding predictors (GlobPlot and
Foldindex) showed better performance on proteins with long
disorder. This suggests that the top-ranked methods can be im-
proved by taking into account long disorder regions in their
training.

Using CATH, 9378 proteins with disorder were extracted form
the UniProt set. Supplementary Figure S6 shows the perform-
ance of the top ﬁve methods on the four main CATH classes.
The CATH few secondary structure class is predicted consider-
ably below average. This could be due to the high quantity of
disorder in this class (Supplementary Fig. S7). Mainly alpha
structures are clearly easier to detect, perhaps due to alpha heli-
ces being dependent on local sequence. Conversely, mainly beta
structures are harder to predict perhaps because beta sheet

Performance

Fig. 9. Relationship between GO cellular component and disorder
performance of top ﬁve predictors. All proteins had at least some
disorder. GO terms only considered if the number of proteins is >50

hydrogen bonds are dependent on distant residues. This difﬁ-
culty in capturing distant sequential dependencies is a common
problem in secondary structure prediction (Rost, 2001) and likely
also true for disorder.

3.5 Functional variability

The top five predictor SOV performances for proteins with at
least one disordered residue are separated into the three GO
classes (Ashburner et al., 2000). Cellular Component covers
3458 proteins, Biological Process 4696 and Molecular Function
5260. Figure 9 shows how SOV varies significantly for different
cellular component terms. Virion-related proteins have the most
interesting performance drop, probably due to an increased level
of disorder in these proteins (Supplementary Fig. S8). Perhaps
more interestingly, performance for membrane and extracellular
proteins is generally lower than average, even though the amount
of disorder was not enriched (Supplementary Fig. S8). This may
be a consequence of disorder having different amino acid com-
position in these proteins (Xue et al., 2009). For GO Molecular
Function (Supplementary Fig. S9), binding and transporter
activity are predicted well but the activity relationships struc-
tural molecule and receptor have the lowest performance.
Disorder performance also varies with Biological Process
(Supplementary Fig. S10). Signaling and regulation were easier
to predict while biological adhesion has a glaringly poor perform-
ance. In each of the three GO classes, SOV performance varies
by up to 10% for different GO terms.

4 DISCUSSION

Efﬁcient disorder predictions are Vital for understanding large
collections of proteins and entire proteomes. In this work,
11 predictors are evaluated on 25833 UniProt sequences with
disorder annotations from X-ray crystallographic structures.
The evaluation procedure consists in measuring performances
using 12 different scores and ranking the predictors while
highlighting statistically similar groups. Although in some cases
the disorder deﬁnition used will not represent true functional

Large-scale disorder assessment

 

mobility, we feel that it should capture most aspects of intrinsic
disorder. The assumption is that in most cases, missing backbone
atoms in PDB structures correlate with intrinsic disorder deﬁned
in DisProt (Sickmeier et al., 2007). Our deﬁnition is also argu-
ably more stable because it is based on a majority vote on all
PDB structures covering a UniProt entry. Thus experimental
errors in X-ray crystallography (e.g. missing residues due to
low resolution) should be removed, as disorder is only considered
if it occurs most frequently in the PDB.

The evaluation reveals a strong variability in predictors
across the 12 measures, indicating different prediction styles
(e.g. overprediction or conﬁdent underprediction). Ranking
each predictor with the 12 measures shows both DisEmbl-465
and IUPred-short performing consistently well on each measure.
The ranking was robust because the 12 measures show little
correlation (Fig. 2). Predictors that ranked poorly still contain
a good signal across our disorder deﬁnition. In most cases, they
fall behind because they offer a different interpretation, which
may be useful in alternative settings. At CASP, the best disorder
predictors are widely known to be meta-predictors combining
orthogonal information (i.e. unique predictors performing
well). A correlation analysis on the predictors produced similar
clusters as well as unique predictors. Some predictors showed
both uniqueness and good performance, indicating a consensus
predictor may be beneﬁcial. Using predictor combinations,
88.8% of structured and 24.5% of disordered residues are
found with highly conﬁdent agreement. The remaining 10.0%
structured and 34.2% disordered residues classiﬁed as uncertain
may be decided with more sophisticated heuristics (e. g. high resi-
due scores).

Highly accurate predictors on UniProt sequences are Vital,
considering that users are invariably trying to understand
disorder properties of unannotated proteins and not the PDB,
which is already annotated with quality structural information.
Despite this, the literature largely concentrates on PDB chain
assessments. The performance on the UniProt disorder deﬁnition
is substantially lower than the equivalent evaluation on PDB
chains. A similar effect was recently noted in the CASP-10
assessment, where database predictions were worse than the
direct submissions by the same methods (Monastyrskyy et al.,
2014). In general, increases in PDB chains are observed across all
measures (Supplementary Table S7), suggesting that the predic-
tion of the more desirable UniProt disorder may be worth
considering for training new predictors.

There are large performance variations when splitting the data
into groups of proteins. As expected, predictors prefer large
amounts of low sequence complexity, but the performance
seems to plateau after 20% low complexity. On the other
hand, long disorder detection seems to be more difﬁcult,
especially for the predictors we ﬁnd to be accurate. While both
trends are somewhat expected, the dependence of performance
on structure and function are less obvious. At the structural level,
beta-only proteins seem to be more difﬁcult to predict compared
with alpha-only or mixed alpha/beta. The few secondary structure
class is certainly the poorest, but this may be due to long
disordered regions being poorly detected. Given that functional
disorder analysis using predictors is gaining attention (Ward
et al., 2004; Xue et al., 2014), prediction error is shown relative
to G0. The analysis shows that the average error rate is not

universal across all functions. It is possible that enriched
functions found in genome analysis may have a slight bias. For
example, the association with disorder and binding, signaling and
regulation is known, but here we found that they are more easily
detected, possibly inferring enrichment. Compared with Virion
sequences, which are more abundant in experimental disorder
(Supplementary Fig. S8) and supported by the literature
0(ue et al., 2014), the error rates on their predictions are
higher than average. One of the main reasons for performance
variation could be the distribution of protein types in predictor
training sets. Binding, signalling and regulation proteins together
constitute a large fraction of known disorder datasets, and it is
reasonable to assume that the same distributions are used in each
predictor. It is therefore possible that predictors are optimized
for these common families. Optimistically, the use of this prior
knowledge could enhance predictor training or motivate the de-
velopment of speciﬁc tools.

To our knowledge, this is not only the first large scale analysis
of disorder predictions from X-ray crystallographic structures
but also the ﬁrst attempt to provide error rates on sequence,
structure and functional protein types. We are in the process of
developing this evaluation into an automatic evaluation server
and plan to integrate it in the new version of MobiDB
(Di Domenico et al., 2012).

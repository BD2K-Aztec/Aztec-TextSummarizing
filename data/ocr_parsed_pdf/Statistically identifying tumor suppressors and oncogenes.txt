Abstract

Motivation: Several tools exist to identify cancer driver genes based on somatic mutation data.
However, these tools do not account for subclasses of cancer genes: oncogenes, which undergo
gain—of—function events, and tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) which undergo loss—of—function. A
method which accounts for these subclasses could improve performance while also suggesting a
mechanism of action for new putative cancer genes.

Results: We develop a panel of five complementary statistical tests and assess their performance
against a curated set of 99 HiConf cancer genes using a pan—cancer dataset of 1.7 million muta—
tions. We identify patient bias as a novel signal for cancer gene discovery, and use it to significantly
improve detection of oncogenes over existing methods (AUROC=0.894). Additionally, our test of
truncation event rate separates oncogenes and TSGs from one another (AUROC: 0.922). Finally, a
random forest integrating the five tests further improves performance and identifies new cancer
genes, including CACNG3, HDAC2, HIST1H1E, NXF1, GPSZ and HLA—DRB1.

istics and integrating them, as well as the HiConf gene panel, are available at www.github.com/

Since the first cancer genome was sequenced in 2008, large—scale
studies surveying multiple tumor types have been released (Kandoth
et (11., 2013; Lawrence et (11., 2014; Ley et (11., 2008). By sequencing
paired tumor—normal exomes and genomes, these studies generate
catalogs of tumor—specific mutations, such as single nucleotide vari—
ants and small insertions/deletions (indels). Mutation data can be
used to detect evidence of positive selection and new potential

as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors genes (TSGs). However,
tumor mutation rates vary by several orders of magnitude, increas—
ing from acute myeloid leukemia to melanoma (Lawrence et (11.,
2013). Particularly in tumors with high mutation rates, it is likely
that most mutations occur incidentally to tumor development.
Therefore, mutations and genes must be experimentally character—
ized to identify biologically relevant mutations; however, due to the

number of background mutations, these experiments pose a high
risk, low reward opportunity. In general, only genes with strikingly
nonrandom mutation patterns or new mutations in known cancer
genes prompt further investigation (Bose et (11., 2013).

Computational solutions can alleviate this problem by directing
investigators to genes that are more likely to be cancer—causing.
Existing methods detect several signals of cancer gene positive selec—
tion, including: mutation rate (Dees et (11., 2012), functional impact
scores (Gonzalez—Perez and Lopez—Bigas, 2012), intra—gene mutation
clustering and recurrence (Tamborero et (11., 2013), post—transla—
tional modifications (Reimand and Bader, 2013), or DNA lesion
likelihood (Hua et (11., 2013). Earlier work also demonstrated the
importance of patient—specific mutation rates in detecting cancer
genes (Youn and Simon, 2011). Furthermore, integrating these com—
plementary approaches can lead to improved performance (Davoli
et (11., 2013; Tamborero et (11., 2013).

One shortcoming of these methods is that they identify cancer
genes, but cannot separate likely oncogenes and tumor suppressors.
Oncogenes are of particular interest to biologists, as they can pro—
vide a direct target for small molecule inhibitors. However, recent
studies show that tumor suppressors and oncogenes are separable
using rates of truncating mutations, mutation clustering and copy—
number data (Schroeder et (11., 2014) (see Supplementary Fig. S1 for
representative examples). It is possible that an ensemble method
that treats oncogenes and TSGs as separate classes would improve
performance over existing methods, in addition to suggesting
whether new putative cancer genes operate through gain—of—function
(oncogene) or loss—of—function (TSG).

In this study, we use a pan—cancer dataset of 1.7 million muta—
tions and manually curated set of 99 high confidence (HiConf) can—
cer genes to develop a panel of five statistical tests. The tests detect
different signals of positive selection and are designed to detect puta—
tive oncogenes and TSGs. In particular, we identify patient and can—
cer type bias as new cancer gene signals, and leverage them to
markedly improve detection of oncogenes. We then integrate these
tests into a random forest model which can simultaneously identify
new putative cancer genes, and classify them as likely oncogenes and
tumor suppressors. We validate by assessing the performance of pre—
vious tools and our new methods against several independent panels
of known and putative cancer genes. Finally, we explore the per—
formance of these methods in specific cancer types and suggest new
putative cancer genes.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Data gathering and quality control

Mutation Annotation Files were drawn from data repositories for
the TCGA, ICGC and COSMIC (Supplementary Table S1). Only
columns for Cancer Type, Study, Patient Identifier, Chromosome,
Start Position, End Position, Reference and Variant Allele were re—
tained. A small number of hg18—based studies (accounting for ~2%
of the dataset) were converted to hg19 using the UCSC Genome
Browser liftOver utility with default settings (Fujita et (11., 2011).
Patient samples were frequently included in more than one dataset,
potentially producing duplicate or contradictory mutations. For a
given patient and genomic position, only mutations from the most
recent dataset were retained. Data were annotated with the
ANNOVAR software suite using RefSeq libraries (Wang et (11.,
2010). Mutations were also labeled with functional impact scores to
allow the use of Oncodrive—fm (Gonzalez—Perez and Lopez—Bigas,
2012). In cases where a gene was related to multiple transcripts and

isoforms, the transcript which preserved the most mutations was
used first, with mutations from alternate isoforms being annotated
as such. Data were gathered July 27 to August 1, 2013.

2.2 HiConf cancer gene panel construction

As our goal is to use mutation data to find potential cancer genes
that can be confidently carried into biological experiments, we
sought HiConf cancer genes that are biologically established as a
training data set. This HiConf panel was focused towards known
cancer genes that have previously been detected through genetic cri—
teria, and which could plausibly be detected with exome sequencing
data. The following steps were taken to ensure the HiConf cancer
gene panel met these criteria. The Cancer Gene Census (CGC) pro—
vided candidates (Futreal et (11., 2004). Genes which have only been
observed in translocations (as per the CGC annotations) were imme—
diately eliminated, as our dataset lacks translocation events and it is
often unclear whether translocation partners are active cancer genes
individually. This left 204 candidate genes.

A literature search was then performed. A gene qualified for the
HiConf panel if a scientific publication could be found which ful—
filled one of the following: (i) Demonstrated a cancer—like phenotype
in cell lines when the gene was activated or inhibited. (ii)
Demonstrated a change in disease progression in mouse models of
cancer when the gene was activated or inhibited. (iii) Demonstrated
the gene as a causative agent of a Mendelian human tumor syn—
drome. Importantly, all means of gene alteration (RNAi, ectopic ex—
pression, drug or antibody targeting, null models, etc.) were
accepted for animal and cell studies, and any phenotype outlined in
the Hallmarks of Cancer was accepted as cancer—like (Hanahan and
Weinberg, 2011). The sources for the literature search included
OMIM and PubMed. The literature search left 99 HiConf cancer
genes. Based on the preponderance of literature recovered, these
genes were further categorized as oncogenes (ONCs, gain of func—
tion causes pro—cancer phenotype) or TSGs (loss of function causes
pro—cancer phenotype).

2.3 Tool import
Three existing tools were applied to the dataset: MutSigCV
(Lawrence et (11., 2013), OncodriveCLUST (Tamborero et (11., 2013)
and Oncodrive—fm (Gonzalez—Perez and Lopez—Bigas, 2012).
MutSigCV identifies likely cancer genes by detecting genes with
elevated mutation rates. MutSigCV v1.3 was run on the dataset
using scripts downloaded from http://www.broadinstitute.org/can
cer/cga/mutsig following the provided instructions and default set—
tings. The MutSigCV P—value was used to assess tool performance.
OncodriveCLUST is a cancer gene detection method which uses
intra—protein mutation clustering to identify possible cancer genes.
Software was downloaded from http://bg.upf.edu/group/projects/
oncodrive—clust.php, and run on the dataset using the included in—
structions and default settings. Oncodrive—fm detects genes with un—
usually impactful mutations, as judged by a suite of functional
impact scores (SIFT, PolyPhen2 and MutationAssessor) (Gonzalez—
Perez and Lopez—Bigas, 2012). The Oncodrive—fm method was re—
implemented in R, using the dataset itself as an internal null
distribution.

2.4 Test development

We assembled five statistical tests that target several signals of posi—
tive selection in cancer genes. ‘Patient Distribution’ and ‘Cancer
Type Distribution’ operate similarly and detect genes that are
mutated in nonrandom sets of patients or cancer types. ‘Unaffected

Residues’ is our method to identify genes with unusual levels of mu—
tation recurrence. ‘VEST Mean’ uses VEST scores (Carter et (11.,
2013) to identify functional impact bias among genes. Finally,
‘Truncation Rate’ is our approach to detecting genes that have
unusual numbers of truncation events; either an enrichment (as is
expected of TSGs) or depletion (as is expected of oncogenes).

‘Patient Distribution’ and ‘Cancer Type Distribution’ are calcu—
lated similarly. Each mutation occurs within a patient (or cancer
type). A randomly mutated gene should be mutated in a random set
of patients (or cancer types). This null hypothesis can be tested using
the Pearson Chi—Square Goodness—of—Fit test, with the entire dataset
providing the null expectations. For each gene g, a chi—square statis—
tic was calculated:

2
Xzzimp—Ep) Ep NpNg

where O is the observed count of mutations for a given patient (or
cancer type), E is the expected number of mutations for the same pa—
tient (or cancer type), and P is the number of unique patients (or can—
cer types). The expected count for a given patient (or cancer type) and
gene is the product of the total number of mutations in the patient
(Np) and the total number of mutations in the gene (Ng) divided by
the number of mutations in the dataset (N). The P—value is calculated
by simulation since the low expectations would violate normality as—
sumptions required to use the theoretical chi—square distribution.
Given the number of mutations in a gene, the test statistic is calculated
for 10 000 random draws from the full list of patient (or cancer type)
labels with replacement, and the upper tail probability of a higher test
statistic under the null distribution is reported. All mutations, includ—
ing synonymous mutations, are used when calculating ‘Patient
Distribution’ and ‘Cancer Type Distribution’.

‘Unaffected Residues’ detects high levels of recurrence by con—
sidering the number of un—mutated residues in a gene. First, given
the number of mutations and the protein length, the probability of a
residue being un—mutated is calculated based on the Poisson distri—
bution. Because the mutation count is zero, the estimated probabil—
ity of an unaffected residue simplifies to:

13 zero : e—n/I
Where 7; is the number of mutations in the protein, 1 is protein
length, and sz is the estimated probability of a given residue being
un—mutated. Once sz is calculated, the binomial distribution is
used to calculate the probability of a gene having at least the
observed number of unaffected residues:

[—1
l A i A —i
 : Z(i)Pzero  _ Pzero)’

i:x

Where x is the observed number of unaffected residues and l is the
protein length. ‘Unaffected Residues’, represents the probability of a
gene having as many or more unaffected residues as observed if mu—
tation location is entirely random. Only nonsynonymous protein—
coding mutations are used to calculate this test, as recurrent syn—
onymous mutations can suggest alignment errors and may produce
false positives.

‘VEST Mean’ is calculated in a very similar manner as the indi—
vidual sub—scores used within Oncodrive—fm (Gonzalez—Perez and
Lopez—Bigas, 2012), but uses the Variant Effect Scoring Tool as the
base functional impact score (Carter et (11., 2013). It is the upper tail
probability of a gene having a mean VEST score greater than that
observed, given the number of mutations, based on 10 000 random

draws with replacement from all observed VEST scores. VEST
scores are limited to missense mutations, so imputation was required
for other mutations. We used the same rationale as was used in
Oncodrive—fm. Synonymous and non—coding mutations were as—
signed a value of 0, the lowest functionality score under VEST, while
in—frame and frameshift indels, premature stop, nonstop and splice
site mutations were assigned the highest value of 1. Synonymous
and nonsynonymous mutations are used in this calculation.

To use ‘Truncation Rate’, a gene’s mutations are categorized as
truncating (i.e. Splice Site, Frameshift Insertion/Deletion, Premature
Stop/Nonsense) or non—truncating. Then the upper tail binomial
probability of at least the observed number of truncation events
(using the truncation rate across the dataset for the null distribution)
is calculated as:

n
71 A i A n—i
P(T > t) Z  l- )PTrunc (1 — PTrmtc)

Where Pt,Llnc : 182 030 truncation events / 1 703 709 muta—
tions:0.107, t is the observed number of truncating events for a
given gene and n is the total number of mutations in the gene.
Synonymous and non—synonymous mutations are used in this
calculation.

2.5 Imputation

Our tests rely on very basic annotations (e.g. Sample ID, Cancer
Type, Mutation Type, etc.) and consequently we had very low rates
of missingness. Two exceptions warrant note, and both are related
to ‘Unaffected Residues’. This test requires a valid protein length to
be calculated; however, after integrating datasets, ~4% of genes
had protein lengths smaller than the most downstream mutations. In
these cases, the test uses the most downstream mutation position as
a conservative proxy of protein length. The other exception is in
model training. Most of our tests are calculable for virtually all
genes. The exception is ‘Unaffected Residues’, which cannot be cal—
culated for the ~10% of genes with no coding nonsynonymous mu—
tations. The data matrix was filled in by mean imputation prior to
model training. Missing values were excluded from the calculation
or assessment of individual tests.

2.6 Model generation

We compared Random Forests, SVMs and Naive Bayes classifiers in
separating the three gene classes (Unknown Function, HiConf
Oncogenes, HiConf TSGs) using the individual tests of our panel.
Random Forests and SVMs both performed well. Random Forests
were chosen because they have been used in previous tools such as
OncodriveROLE (Schroeder et (11., 2014) and worked well with de—
fault settings (mtry : 2, trees : 500).

To generate the scores and predictions used in the study, we
trained a random forest (RF5) on the five individual tests (‘Patient
Distribution’, ‘Cancer Type Distribution’, ‘Unaffected Residues’,
‘Truncation Rate’, ‘VEST Mean’) and labels generated from the
HiConf panel (22 801 unknown genes, 48 TSGs, 51 Oncogenes).
TSGs and ONCs were up—sampled during training to better calibrate
the model (trees were trained on 300 unknowns, 30 TSGs and 30
ONCs). Five—fold cross validation was used to generate predictions,
repeated 50 times. The repeated cross validation runs were averaged
to generate the stable predictions presented in the study.

2.7 Validation gene panels
In addition to the manually curated HiConf gene panel, we
also sought out additional panels of established cancer genes.

R.D.Kumar et al.

 

These panels are necessary to validate the performance of our ran—
dom forest model, since even with cross validation its performance
on the HiConf panel could be over—optimistic.

We gathered the high confidence driver (HCD), Cancer5000 and
TSGene lists as presented in Schroeder et al. (2014). These were ori—
ginally generated by Tamborero et al. (2013), Lawrence et al.
(2014) and Zhao et al. (2013), respectively (Lawrence et (11., 2014;
Tamborero et (11., 2013; Zhao et (11., 2013). In addition to the filters
applied by Schroeder and colleagues, we ensured independence by
depleting these lists for any members of the HiConf panel, leaving
149, 96 and 55 genes in the respective panels. Note that while they
are independent of the HiConf list, they do overlap with one
another.

Although the HCD and Cancer5000 lists may contain both
oncogenes and TSGs, the TSGene list is composed of TSGs exclu—
sively. To generate an oncogene—only list, we defined the Kinase list
as any kinase bearing a known activating cancer mutation in Kin—
Driver (Simonetti et al. 2014). This panel consists of 29 genes after
being depleted of HiConf genes.

2.8 Cancer subset analysis

Cancers with at least 500 patients or 200 000 mutations were con—
sidered in the cancer type analysis. Tests and RF5 models were
applied using identical procedures to the pan—cancer analysis.

2.9 Statistics and software

All comparisons of AUROCs were performed as two—sided DeLong
Tests (DeLong et (11., 1988) with adjustment for ties. All analyses
were performed in R v2.15. Modeling was performed using methods
available through the randomForest (Breiman, 2001) and e1071
(Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes) packages. AUROCs, ROC
plots and DeLong Tests were performed using the pROC package.

2.10 Data availability

The dataset is available along with a script, instructions and sample
data to be used to train RF5 models on any dataset. Please see www.

3 Results

3.1 Data assembly and quality control

The analytic ﬂow follows the schema in Supplementary Figure S2.
Data sources are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The final dataset
includes 1 703 709 mutations across 10 239 patients (Supplementary
Fig. S3). In total 22 902 genes appear at least once in the dataset,
with a median of 49 mutations per gene. This is one of the largest
assembled pan—cancer data sets and is publicly accessible (See
Materials and Methods for more details).

3.2 Developing a panel of known cancer genes

Based on a criteria—driven literature review, 99 genes were collected
into a high—confidence cancer gene panel (HiConf, see ‘Methods’
and Supplementary Table S2 for details). The HiConf gene panel
was further divided into 48 TSGs (with 15 698 mutations) and 51
ONCs (with 11 243 mutations). Rather than defining a separate set
of presumptively neutral genes, the remaining 22801 genes were
labeled as ‘unknown’. Most unknown genes are neutral with regards
to cancer progression, and the set as a whole is treated as neutral for
the purposes of training and assessment.

3.3 Test design and assessment

Individual methods of cancer gene prediction must separate the dis—
tinct mutation patterns of ONCs, TSGs and neutral genes. In par—
ticular, TSGs tend to be enriched in truncation events, while
oncogenes are depleted; in addition, oncogenes tend to have clus—
tered mutations (Supplementary Fig. S1). We performed statistical
tests for each of five signals of positive selection, and refer to them
as follows: ‘Truncation Rate’ (rate of truncating events), ‘Unaffected
Residues’ (intra—gene mutation clustering/recurrence), ‘VEST Mean’
(functional impact bias), ‘Patient Distribution’ (bias in patient
labels) and ‘Cancer Type Distribution’ (cancer type bias).
OncodriveCLUST, Oncodrive—fm, and MutSigCV were also applied
to the dataset (Gonzalez—Perez and Lopez—Bigas, 2012; Lawrence
et (11., 2013; Tamborero et (11., 2013).

We use the Area Under Receiver Operator Characteristic
(AUROC) to gauge performance as it is threshold independent and
testable (DeLong et (11., 1988). In particular, we consider the follow—
ing classification tasks: separation of the HiConf ONCs and TSGs
from other genes of unknown function (UK) as separate and pooled
classes, and separation of ONCs and TSGs from one another.

‘Patient Distribution’ is notable because it relies on a novel can—
cer gene signal which we call patient bias. The contribution of
tumors to the pan—cancer dataset is highly unequal because tumor
mutation rates vary by up to four orders of magnitude
(Supplementary Fig. S3). However, mutations within HiConf TSGs
and oncogenes are much more evenly distributed between patients
(Fig. 1A). ‘Patient Distribution’ makes use of a chi—square statistic to
detect genes which are frequently mutated in relatively hypo—
mutated tumors. Unlike many of the other statistics and tools we as—
sessed, ‘Patient Distribution’ detects HiConf oncogenes and HiConf
TSGs equally well (Fig. 1B and Table 1). In fact, it is the single best
test for detecting oncogenes and the HiConf panel as a whole, with
AUROCs of 0.894 and 0.900, respectively. Known oncogenes

including TRAF7 and ALK are missed by previously published tools
at the P < 0.05 cutoff, but are easily detected by ‘Patient
Distribution’ (Supplementary Table S3).

‘Cancer Type Distribution’ is very similar to ‘Patient
Distribution’, but relies on cancer type bias to identify cancer genes.
For instance, it easily highlights VHL, a HiConf tumor suppressor
which is frequently truncated in renal clear cell carinomas
(Supplementary Table S3). It also identifies the known tumor sup—
pressor PTCH1, which is not identified by existing tools.

‘Unaffected Residues’ is our test of mutation clustering and re—
currence. Rather than testing for clustering directly, as was the ap—
proach taken by OncodriveCLUST (Tamborero et (11., 2013), we
instead examine the number of unmutated residues. ‘Unaffected
Residues’ is a one—tailed binomial test for the number of unmutated
residues, assuming the number of mutations per residue is poisson
distributed. It is the second best method for detecting HiConf ONC
(AUROC: 0.855) and third best for the whole HiConf panel
(AUROC : 0.861). It is superior to Oncodrive—CLUST in these tasks
(Table 1). The top four genes according to ‘Unaffected Residues’ are
KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF and TP53 (Supplementary Table S3), all of
which have well known mutation clusters.

‘VEST Mean’ tests for functional impact bias. It reports the
probability of a randomly mutated gene having a higher average
functional impact, very similar in concept to the method used in
Oncodrive—fm (Gonzalez—Perez and Lopez—Bigas, 2012), but with
better oncogene detection (AUROC : 0.796 versus 0.710, Table 1).
It is also the best method for detecting TSGs (AUROC : 0.938).

‘Truncation Rate’ is the final test and has unique properties. It is
well appreciated that TSGs are enriched in protein—truncating muta—
tions (Fig. 1C). This pattern lead Vogelstein and colleagues to

Table 1. AUROCs of individual tests and RF5 model

suggest that genes with >20% truncating events be considered puta—
tive TSGs (Vogelstein et (11., 2013). ‘Truncation Rate’ formalizes this
concept using a one—sided binomial test, which reports the probabil—
ity of a randomly mutated gene bearing an equal or greater number
of truncation events (i.e. splice site, premature stop and frameshift
indels), given a fixed number of mutations. However, as a one—sided
test, ‘Truncation Rate’ is also sensitive to the relative depletion of
truncation events in oncogenes (Fig. 1D). It is by far the best method
for separating oncogenes and TSGs (AUROC : 0.922, Table 1,
ROC curves in Supplementary Fig. S4).

3.4 Integration into a single model

As Table 1 illustrates, the tests we have identified are complemen—
tary, each having different performances in our classification tasks.
We hypothesized that a model integrating the full panel would be
able to separate all three gene classes (HiConf Oncogenes, HiConf
TSGs, all other genes of unknown function) from one another. To
test this hypothesis, we trained a Random Forest model on the five
individual test values as predictor variables. Gene labels were gener—
ated from the HiConf panel, resulting in 51 ONC, 48 TSG, and
22 801 unknown (UK) genes. Most of the UK genes are passenger
genes, so this large class serves as a neutral class for training.
Training was performed in five—fold cross validation, with results
averaged over 50 repetitions.

The five—test model, which we refer to as RF5, produces a score
for probability of membership in each class. These scores summate
to 1, allowing genes to be visualized in a ternary plot (Fig. 2). UK
genes which are placed near the ONC and TSG regions are putative
cancer genes, while HiConf ONCs and TSGs which are assigned to
the Unknown region are false negatives.

As Figure 2 shows, RF5 is able to delineate most HiConf ONCs
and TSGs from the bulk of UK genes. It also suggests a large number
of UK genes which appear similar to ONCs and TSGs.
Simultaneously, RF5 separates the ONCs and TSGs from one an—
other. When assessed for performance at each task separately, RF5
is significantly better or not significantly different from the best indi—
vidual tests. It performs markedly better than ‘VEST Mean’ in de—
tecting TSGs (AUROC: 0.980 versus 0.938), the same as ‘Patient
Distribution’ in detection ONCs (AUROC:0.891 versus 0.894),
and the same as ‘Truncation Rate’ in separating ONCs and TSGs
(AUROC: 0.924 versus 0.922, Table 1). HiConf genes which are
identified by few of the individual tests can often be identified confi—
dently by RF5, demonstrating the importance of integrating multiple
approaches (Supplentary Fig. SSA).

3.5 Validation panels

The HiConf panel serves as our primary method of assessment for
pre—existing tools and our new methods. However, RF5 is trained to
detect the HiConf panel, and it is possible the RF5 performance esti—
mates are optimistic even with cross—validation. Therefore, we
retrieved four validation panels and depleted them of the HiConf
panel members to ensure independence (see ‘Methods’). We then as—
sessed the ability of our methods to prioritize the validation panels
over other genes of unknown function (Table 2).

The HCD panel was defined by Tamborero et al. (2013) using a
variety of existing tools including Oncodrive—fm (Tamborero et (11.,
2013). After excluding HiConf cancer genes, it consists of 149 mem—
bers. We find that RF5 has the best performance (AUROC : 0.884)
on this set, but that ‘VEST Mean’ and Oncodrive—fm are not signifi—
cantly different. This expected, as the list was defined in part using
Oncodrive—fm. We also examined the Cancer5 000 gene panel,
which has 96 members after depletion of HiConf genes (Lawrence
et (11., 2014). It overlaps by roughly 50% with the HCD panel, and
RF5 still has the strongest performance (AUROC : 0.943). This
panel was defined using MutSigCV, which performs well as ex—
pected (AUROC : 0.882).

Unlike the HCD and Cancer5 000 panels, the TSGene and
Kinase panels are largely composed of TSGs and oncogenes,

by RF5, genes can be stratified as oncogene— or TSG-like. Genes which are
judged as oncogene- or TSG-like, but are not on the HiConf panel, are puta-
tively related to cancer

respectively (see ‘Methods’). The TSGene panel consists of 55 manu—
ally curated tumor suppressors (Zhao et (11., 2013). ‘VEST Mean’
has the highest performance (AUROC : 0.876), but RF5 is not sig—
nificantly worse. The Kinase panel consists of 29 manually curated
kinases that are known to harbor activating mutations in cancer
(Simonetti et (11., 2014). RF5 again has the strongest performance
(AUROC : 0.801).

3.6 Predicted cancer genes

For brevity and clarity we will focus on the top 100 predictions
made by RF5 in the pan—cancer setting. They include many poten—
tially new cancer genes, of which we will highlight a few
(Supplementary Fig. S5B and S6). Several genes are related to chro—
matin structural and epigenetic regulation. GPS2 and HDAC2 are
members of the NCOR—HDAC3 complex (Zhang et (11., 2002) and
are predicted TSGs. HIST1H1E, a linker protein in nucleosomes, is
predicted to be an oncogene. Other novel predicted cancer genes are
drawn from a range of biological classes: CACNG3 (predicted onco—
gene) is a voltage—dependent calcium channel subunit; NXF1 (pre—
dicted TSG) is a nuclear RNA export factor; and HLA—DRB1
(predicted TSG) is a subunit of MHC Class II. Additionally, several
experimentally known cancer genes are linked to human tumors
through somatic mutation data for the first time. Among these are
the oncogenes SGK1 (Towhid et (11., 2013) and TMEM30A (Kato
et (11., 2013) as well as the TSGs RBM5 (Sutherland et (11., 2010),
CHD4 (Cai et (11., 2014) and CHD2 (Nagarajan et (11., 2009).
Although these are not new cancer genes, their identification by pat—
terns of somatic mutations supports their relevance in human dis—
ease. None of these genes are listed in the Cancer Gene Census.

Many top predicted cancer genes are potentially druggable. A
query of the Drug Gene Interaction Database reveals that 26 of the
top 100 predicted cancer genes have known interactions with drugs,
and an additional 43 belong to a potentially druggable gene category
(Griffith et (11., 2013). With the majority of top predictions being po—
tentially druggable, the prioritized gene list presents opportunities
for both new discoveries in cancer biology and more immediate
pharmacologic interventions.

RF5 also makes high—quality predictions. For instance, very few
of the top 100 predicted cancer genes are biologically implausible.
Among these genes, there is one olfactory receptor (OR4C5) and
one collagen (COL2A1) (Lawrence et (11., 2013). However, technical
artifacts remain a concern. For instance, the highly ranked genes
IL32 and PLAC4 have multiple recurrent frameshift and synonym—
ous events. An examination of alignment files from several of the

affected patients suggests these genes are prone to alignment errors
(data not shown). These examples illustrate the need for human ex—
pertise in scrutinizing prioritized gene lists, and the quality of data
and associated mutation calls in particular.

3.7 Application to specific cancer types

Of our tests, only ‘Cancer Type Distribution’ relies on multiple can—
cer types; the others may perform differently in individual cancers.
To address this possibility, the tests from Table 1 as well as RF5
models were generated for each cancer with at least 500 patients or
200 000 mutations (breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma and endo—
metrial cancers, Supplementary Tables S4—S8). This analysis demon—
strates that the relative performance of these tests is quite consistent
across cancer types and that our new methods outperform previous
tools in a variety of settings (Supplementary Fig. S7).

Analyzing the pan—cancer set may allow us to detect additional
cancer genes due to increased power, but it may also mask cancer—
specific cancer genes. To explore this possibility, we examined the
detection of the HiConf panel in the pan—cancer and cancer—specific
datasets. We found that 11 HiConf cancer genes were detected in
the pan—cancer dataset, but not in the individual cancers, while 10
were detected in at least one of the specific cancers, but not in the
pan—cancer set (Supplementary Fig. S8A). This suggests that we are
likely to make some predictions only in the pan—cancer set, and
others only in specific cancers. In fact, we found that 30 of our top
100 pan—cancer predicted cancer genes could only be detected in the
pan—cancer set (Supplementary Fig. S8B). These included many
promising potential cancer genes such as HDAC2, NXF1 and
TMEM30A, illustrating the value of pooling cancers.

We then sought cancer genes that are cancer—specific and com—
pared their detection across cancer types. We gathered the top 100
predictions for each of breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma and endo—
metrial cancers. Roughly half of the top predictions were cancer—spe—
cific (Supplementary Fig. S9). A few examples include: MED23 and
MYB as putative TSGs in breast cancer; TGIF1 and B3GNT6 as pu—
tative TSGs in colorectal cancer; CDK14, IRF2BPL and NTRK2 as
putative oncogenes in lung adenocarcinoma; CCDC28B and
ATAD2 as potential TSGs in melanoma; and EIF3C as a potential
oncogene in endometrial cancer. We conclude that large numbers of
cancer genes may be cancer—specific. Taken together, these results
suggest the importance of searching for cancer—genes in the pan—
cancer and specific—cancer settings.

Discussion

One use of cancer genome sequencing results is the identification of
novel cancer genes. This problem has two stages: first, cancer genes
must be separated from genes bearing only passenger mutations; se—
cond, cancer genes must be sorted into likely tumor suppressors and
oncogenes. Both stages are crucial because mechanism—specific pre—
dictions are needed to guide downstream analyses and experiments.
In this study we gathered a pan—cancer dataset of 1.7 million vari—
ants and a manually curated set of 99 known cancer genes (HiConf
panel). Using these data, we designed and assessed a panel of statis—
tical tests which identify cancer genes using several signals of posi—
tive selection, as well as separate cancer genes by mechanism of
action. We also compared the performance of these tests to previous
tools in accomplishing these tasks.

In general, we found that HiConf TSGs were easier to detect
than HiConf oncogenes. Several methods had AUROCs of 0.9 or
higher, including the published tool Oncodrive—fm and our tests of

patient and cancer type bias (‘Patient Distribution’, ‘Cancer Type
Distribution’). However, the best single method for detecting TSGs
was our test of functional impact bias, ‘VEST Mean’, with an
AUROC of 0.938.

In contrast, HiConf oncogenes were less easily identified. This is
concerning because oncogenes provide more direct targets for drug
development. The best performing existing tool for detecting the
HiConf oncogenes was OncodriveCLUST with an AUROC of
0.808. With the exception of ‘Truncation Rate’, all of the tests in
our panel had AUROCs of 0.80 or greater when detecting HiConf
oncogenes. Particular improvement was observed with ‘Unaffected
Residues’, which tests for mutation clustering/recurrence and had an
AUROC of 0.855, and ‘Patient Distribution’, which was the best
performer with an AUROC of 0.894.

Two of our tests warrant emphasis. ‘Patient Distribution’ uses a
novel signal of positive selection. It identifies genes with mutations
that occur in nonrandom sets of patients, particularly genes with mu—
tations that occur in relatively hypo-mutated tumors, as would be
anticipated of genes bearing driver mutations. For identifying the
HiConf panel as a whole (TSG+ ONC), ‘Patient Distribution’ is the
strongest performer with AUROC of 0.900. Another important mem—
ber of our statistical panel is ‘Truncation Rate’. This test is
a formalized version of the 20/20 rule for TSGs put forward
by Vogelstein et al. (2013), and uses the binomial distribution to
model the expected number of truncation events per gene. ‘Truncation
Rate’ can be used to separate TSGs and oncogenes with an AUROC
of 0.922. It is the only method that usefully accomplished this task.

Because the individual tests of our panel offered complementary
strengths, we also integrated them into a single model. We found
that a random forest built on our five tests (RF5) was effective at
separating HiConf oncogenes and TSGs from passenger genes, and
from one another. Moreover, this integration did not require any
loss in performance: RF5 is as good as or better than the individual
methods at every classification tasks we assessed. We also confirmed
these results in several independent validation gene panels.

RF5 identifies many potential pan—cancer cancer genes. These in—
clude the predicted oncogenes CACNG3 and HIST1H1E, and the
predicted TSGs HDAC2, GPS2, NXF1 and HLA—DRB1. It also
identifies several known cancer genes through genome sequencing
for the first time, including SGK1, TMEM30A, CHD2, CHD4 and
RBM5. Many RF5 predictions are potentially druggable.
Furthermore, additional cancer genes can be identified when focus—
ing on single cancer types. In fact, we found that half of RF5 predic—
tions within tumor types were cancer—specific. These results
illustrate the importance of searching for cancer genes in both the
pan—cancer and specific—cancer settings and suggest many new po—
tential avenues of research.

However, there remains room for improvement. As Figure 2 il—
lustrates, some oncogenes and TSGs could not be detected by RF5,
and some were not detectable by any individual test or pre—existing
tool (Supplementary Fig. SSA). There are two major explanations.
Foremost, cancer genes will be undetectable if they are primarily
altered through means other than somatic mutations in the exome.
Additionally, our cancer gene panels may include genes that are
involved in later stages of disease progression, such as metastasis
and drug resistance. These are true cancer genes, but may be un—
detectable in the available data as tumor samples largely come from
newly diagnosed patients (Kandoth et (11., 2013). Fortunately, our
methods are highly expandable, and multiple strategies could im—
prove performance, such as: (i) Introduction of additional, heteroge—
neous data types. (ii) Improved tests. (iii) Improved model design
and training. (iv) Expansion of the HiConf cancer gene panel.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the detection of puta—
tive cancer genes requires a mix of complementary methods. We
have developed a panel of five statistical tests that outperform previ—
ous methods. In particular, ‘Patient Distribution’ detects oncogenes
especially well. We have also integrated these tests into a single clas—
sifier, and demonstrated that it performs as well or better than previ—
ous tools in both training and validation cancer gene panels. These
expansions to computational methods, along with targeted func—
tional experiments, will lead to a more complete understanding of
the cancer genome.

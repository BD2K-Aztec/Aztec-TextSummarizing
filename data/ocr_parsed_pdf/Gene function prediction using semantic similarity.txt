ABSTRACT

Motivation: Functional genomics data provides a rich source of
information that can be used in the annotation of the thousands
of genes of unknown function found in most sequenced genomes.
However, previous gene function prediction programs are mostly
produced for relatively well-annotated organisms that often have a
large amount of functional genomics data. Here, we present a novel
method for predicting gene function that uses clustering of genes by
semantic similarity, a na ve Bayes classifier and ‘enrichment analysis’
to predict gene function for a genome that is less well annotated but
does has a severe effect on human health, that of the malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum.

Results: Predictions for the molecular function, biological process
and cellular component of Rfalciparum genes were created
from eight different datasets with a combined prediction also
being produced. The high-confidence predictions produced by the
combined prediction were compared to those produced by a simple
K -nearest neighbour classifier approach and were shown to improve
accuracy and coverage. Finally, two case studies are described,
which investigate two biological processes in more detail, that of
translation initiation and invasion of the host cell.

1 INTRODUCTION

The massive improvements in DNA sequencing technology have
led in the past decade to ever more genomes being sequenced. Most
newly sequenced genomes contain a large number of genes whose
function cannot be inferred through conventional homology methods
such as BLAST and annotating the function of these genes has been
aided in recent years by the production of large high-throughput
datasets. These datasets can be based on genomic sequence data

using methods such as gene fusion (Marcotte et (11., 1999) and
phylogenetic proﬁles (Pellegrini et (11., 1999) or they can be derived
from experimental methods such as yeast two-hybrid screens and
microarray expression (Troyanskaya et (11., 2003). However, these
datasets are often noisy and incomplete, which can often lead to
problems of low reliability and limited coverage when the data
are used to predict gene function. To address these problems,
several gene function prediction programs have been produced that
combine multiple datasets using machine learning techniques to
create synergistic predictions, see the review of MouseFunc for
examples (Pena-Castillo et (11., 2008).

Most of these programs rely on a ‘guilt by association’ approach
where a query protein’s function is inferred from annotated proteins
with ‘similar’ biological attributes. Many different approaches have
been taken but they can effectively be split into either supervised
or unsupervised learning methods. With a supervised approach, a
training dataset is created from which an algorithm learns a set of
rules that can then be used to predict the most likely annotation of
a gene absent from the training set. Alternatively, an unsupervised
approach can be taken where the data are separated into multiple
clusters. Then, for each cluster, a statistical test is applied to see
whether a cluster is overrepresented with a particular annotation.

Functions can be deﬁned using several different databases but the
most popular is the Gene Ontology (GO; Ashburner et (11., 2000).
The G0 database is structured as a directed acyclic graph, in which
the terms form a hierarchy where more speciﬁc GO terms also inherit
the more general terms above them. Early attempts at gene function
prediction often overlooked these high levels of similarity between
terms, but more recently programs have attempted to address
this problem particularly by the inclusion of semantic similarity
measures. Unfortunately, these programs all have drawbacks. Tao
et (11. (2007) could only produce predictions for genes that already
have an annotation, while Yu et (11. (2005) and Pandey et (11.
(2009) both use a semantic similarity measure but only with a
relatively simple K -nearest neighbour (KNN) classiﬁer approach
and only using microarray and protein—protein interaction data. Also,
these two papers limit themselves to human and Saccharomyces
cerevisaie, both organisms which have relatively well-annotated
genomes.

Gene ﬁinction prediction programs for organisms that are less
well annotated but have signiﬁcant effects on humans, such as the

causative agent of the most deadly form of malaria Plasmodium
falciparum, are few. The sparse annotation of such genomes and,
thus, lack of training data makes predicting gene ﬁinction more
challenging. Therefore, in this article, we collate a large, disparate
collection of datasets for Pfalciparum and present a novel method
for gene ﬁinction prediction that attempts to address this problem.
Our program contains three steps: (i) clustering genes using a
semantic similarity measure into functional clusters; (ii) calculating
the probability that a pair of genes belong to the same ﬁinctional
cluster using a Bayes classiﬁer; (iii) using these probabilities, we
employ an enrichment analysis algorithm to predict the function of
the gene. We call this program PAGODA (Protein Assignment by
Gene Ontology Data Associations).

2 METHODS

2.1 Measuring gene functional similarity

Plasmodium falciparum gene function was described using annotations
from the GO database, which separates function into three categories:
molecular function, biological process and cellular component. Measuring
gene function similarity involved a two-stage process. First, the relationships
between all GO terms within a G0 category were quantiﬁed using a semantic
similarity measure developed by Lord et a1. (2003), based on the method
of Resnik (1999). Here, the similarity of two GO terms is based on the
proportion of P. falciparum proteins that are annotated with the most speciﬁc
shared parent term of these two terms. More formally, this is known as the
probability of the minimum subsumer (Pm) as deﬁned in Equation (1) for
the GO terms ([1, [2), where A(tl , [2) is the set of parental terms shared by
t] and [2 and P(t) is the proportion of all GO annotated Rfalciparum genes
that are annotated with this particular GO annotation

Pms(tlvt2)= min {19(1)} (1)

teA(t1,t2)

The Pms is calculated for both the most speciﬁc terms annotated to each
protein and the parent terms as well, and from it the semantic similarity
score between two terms is calculated as in below equation

3(11712)=—lans(Zlvt2) (2)

In this way, annotations that are very close to each other on the GO
graph but biologically dissimilar, e. g. the two organelles: the mitochondrion
(GO:0005739) and the apicoplast (GO:0020011), which share seven out of
eight parent GO terms, are given a low similarity score. For our purposes, the
similarity score was normalized between zero and one by dividing by the
highest similarity score possible in that GO category. Second, we used the GO
term semantic similarity measures to calculate functional similarity between
the two genes based on the method of Wang et a1. (2007), where for two genes
G1 and G2 annotated with GO term sets T1 and T2, respectively, where T1:
{110), i: l,  n} and T2: {1;2),j= l,  m}, the gene function similarity of
the two genes is deﬁned below

2.2 Clustering genes of similar function

To address the problem of sparse function annotation, we clustered genes with
similar GO annotations together. When clustering the data, it is important to
balance the need for the most detailed prediction possible with the demand
for sufﬁcient training data, which leads to the prediction of fewer and broader
functional classes. Here, we approach this issue by clustering genes at
different levels of speciﬁcity, using the DFMAX clique detection algorithm
(Carraghan and Pardalos, 1990), into clusters of similar function where all
gene pairs in each cluster have a gene function similarity greater than a

certain threshold. Eight thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 in 0.1 increments
produced eight speciﬁcity levels for each GO category. Annotations that
were inferred without any manual curation [genes with evidence code:
Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA)] were excluded owing to their
low reliability. Each cluster was then assigned a functional label, which was
derived by ﬁnding the most speciﬁc GO term(s) shared by each gene in that
cluster.

2.3 Bayes classiﬁer

Creating clusters of similar function allowed us to calculate the probability
that two genes belong to the same functional cluster. We calculated this
probability using a Bayes classiﬁer and eight different Rfalciparum datasets,
all of which have been shown to predict gene function (Brehelin et (11.,
2008; Pena-Castillo et (11., 2008). A combined prediction using all these eight
data types was then produced using a naive Bayes classiﬁer, which treats
each data source as independent and is widely acknowledged as excellent
for such data integration tasks. Our classiﬁer was implemented using the
Bayesian Network Toolbox for Matlab (Murphy, 2001), and we used the
maximum likelihood algorithm to learn the model parameters. In this study,
all continuous variable distributions (Bozdech and Affymetrix microarray,
mass spectrometry, gene neighbourhood, gene conservation and domain)
were modelled as Gaussian, while the class node, interaction and gene fusion
nodes were discrete. For each dataset, a measure was produced indicating
the similarity between the two genes. The detail of how the data for each
method was collated and formatted for input into the Bayes classiﬁer, and
the measure used to indicate similarity, are outlined below.

2.3.] Sequence domains Each protein sequence was queried against the
InterPro database (Mulder et (11., 2007) using InterPro scan (Quevillon et (11.,
2005). Then, for each protein pair the proportion of different domains shared
between the two proteins was calculated.

2.3.2 Gene neighbourhood Genes that are found in close proximity to
each other on the genome have been shown to be more likely to share the
same function (Overbeek et (11., 1999). The chromosomal location of all
Rfalciparum genes was downloaded from PlasmoDB (Stoeckert et (11., 2006).
The smallest distance between the two genes was then calculated and divided
by the total length of the chromosome on which the genes resided. Genes
that resided on different chromosomes were assigned a value of 0.5.

2.3.3 Gene conservation Proteins that exist in the same biological
complex or pathway are likely to be co-conserved across a wide set of
organisms, i.e. genes that share similar patterns of gene conservation and
gene loss are more likely to be functionally related (Pellegrini et (11., 1999).
Gene conservation data (also known as phylogenetic proﬁles) were collated
from the Prolinks database (Bowers et (11., 2004), in which the conservation
of each Rfalciparum gene is calculated across 83 organisms. The conﬁdence
score produced by Prolinks was used to indicate the similarity of the two
genes” patterns of conservation.

2.3.4 Gene fusion Two distinct genes involved in the same biological
process in one organism are sometimes found fused into a single gene in
another organism (Marcotte et (11., 1999). Gene fusion data were taken from
Date and Stoeckert (2006), where 163 completely sequenced eukaryotic and
prokaryotic genomes were mined for incidences of gene fusion events. A
binary score was used to indicate whether a gene fusion event had occurred
in another organism between the gene pair.

2.3.5 M icroarray expression Microarray data were split into two different
types (Bozdech and Affymetrix) depending on the microarray used to obtain
the results. The Bozdech microarray data were created using a custom-made
2-channel DNA microarray, and measured the expression proﬁles across 48
individual l-h time-points from the asexual blood stage of the HB3 strain
(Bozdech et (11., 2003). Affymetrix microarray data consisted of expression

proﬁles across 38 experiments from the gametocyte, sporozoite and asexual
blood stage (Le Roch et a1., 2004; Young et a1., 2005) of the parasite’s life
cycle. Co-expression between a pair of genes for both microarray sets was
measured by calculating the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient.

2.3.6 Mass spectrometry The peptide counts from Rfalciparum mass
spectrometry experiments for the asexual blood stage and the gametocyte
stage (Florens et a1., 2002; Lasonder et a1., 2002) were combined. Mass
spectrometry experiments on the sexual stage, the asexual blood stage,
gametocyte, ookinete, oocyst and sporozoite stage of Rberghei were
also included by mapping the Rberghei proteins to their corresponding
Rfalciparum orthologs (Khan et a1., 2005; Le Roch et a1., 2004).

Owing to the difﬁculty of detecting proteins at low concentrations, the
data consisted of a signiﬁcant number of zero counts. We, therefore, found
the Manhattan distance to be the most appropriate correlation measure.

2.3.7 Protein—protein interactions Interaction data for Rfalciparum were
downloaded from the IntAct database (Hermjakob et a1., 2004). Two proteins
were deemed not to interact if their interaction was absent from the IntAct
database and a binary score was then used to indicate whether or not the two
proteins interacted.

2.4 Gene set enrichment

The Bayes classiﬁer calculates the probability of a pair of genes belonging
to the same functional cluster, and this can be applied to a query gene and a
set of genes of known function. The next step is to exploit this information
and assign a function or functions to the query gene. To do this, we assume
that the functional cluster to which the query gene belongs is likely to be
associated with gene pairs with the highest probabilities, in other words, the
cluster should be ‘enriched’ with gene pairs of higher probability.

To calculate this ‘enrichment’ factor for each cluster, we adapt an
algorithm originally designed to perform a similar such calculation for a
group of genes in the microarray data, the Gene Set Enrichment Algorithm
(GSEA; Subramanian et a1., 2005). The schematic of this GSEA prediction
process is outlined in Figure 1.

At a given speciﬁcity level that contains the query gene and N other genes,
the training set is created by using all gene pairs at that level which belong
to the same functional cluster and an equal number of randomly chosen gene
pairs that do not belong to the same functional cluster. A test set is then
produced, consisting of N gene pairs, with each gene pair containing the
query gene and one of the other genes. The Bayes classiﬁer is then trained
on the training set and used to assign the probabilities that the gene pairs in
the test set belong to the same functional cluster.

We now can calculate the functional cluster to which the query gene most
likely belongs. In other words, the functional cluster most enriched among
gene pairs with high probabilities. To measure this enrichment score (ES), the
gene pairs (gj) are ranked in descending order of probability. A running sum
statistic is then calculated as follows: the list is descended and at each step
and for all the functional clusters; a score is calculated that the gene belongs
to the functional cluster (Lclugm) and does not (aniiniclusler) as shown in
Equations (4) and (5). The running sum statistic is then LclusleanOLiniclusler‘

The ES for the cluster is then the maximum deviation of the running sum
statistic from zero achieved during the process (the ES will be positive if the

cluster is enriched and negative if it is impoverished).

The ES is affected by the number and magnitude of the probabilities of
the gene pairs assigned to each cluster, so to allow comparison between ES
scores a normalized ES (NES) is produced. To calculate this, the ranked gene
pair list is permuted (i.e. the probabilities in the list are randomly distributed
across the gene pairs) and a random ES calculated. This is repeated 1000
times and the original ES divided by the mean random ES to give the NES.

The NES score was calculated for all clusters at the given speciﬁcity level
and the cluster with the highest NES score used as the prediction of the
gene’s function.

3 RESULTS

To assess our method, a leave one out cross-validation procedure
was performed for each GO category on all P. falciparum genes with
a G0 annotation (excluding IEAs). Plasmodium falciparum genes
whose functions can be inferred from annotated orthologous proteins
were also excluded where orthologs were deﬁned by the OrthoMCL
(Chen et (11., 2006). A prediction was deﬁned as a success if the
NES score of the annotated ﬁinction was one of three highest for
that speciﬁcity level. Coverage was deﬁned as the proportion of
total number of genes for which a prediction could be made at that
speciﬁcity level. Accuracy and coverage are shown for classiﬁers
based on each dataset separately and all datasets combined are shown
in Figure 2, and given in Supplementary Tables 1—3.

As expected, Figure 2 shows that generally PAGODA achieves a
greater degree of success with more general clusters, partly because
there are fewer clusters to classify into but also because more genes
are clustered at the more general levels and, therefore, more data are
available to inform the prediction. The protein—protein interaction
data, consisting mainly of the yeast two-hybrid data of LaCount
et (11. (2005), produced poor results and the quality of this dataset
has been previously questioned (Wuchty and Ipsaro, 2007). The most
accurate methods were the domain and gene conservation methods,
although the former achieved ~60% coverage and latter only ~ 15%.
The combined method, which uses the predictions of all the other
methods, achieved the highest coverage but not the highest accuracy.
This is likely to be due to the ability of the combined method to
predict the function of genes for which only sparse data are available
but at the cost of decreased conﬁdence in the prediction. The result
is that the overall accuracy of the combined method is reduced.

Gene function prediction in Plasmodium falciparum

 

Accuracy and coverage for each method are remarkably similar for
molecular ﬁinction and biological process, although corresponding
numbers for cellular component are slightly higher.

To complement the results for each separate dataset shown
in Figure 2, we also investigated the performance of classiﬁers
omitting each of the datasets in turn from the combined dataset.
We found that with the exception of domain data, there was
no dataset whose omission signiﬁcantly reduced or increased
the performance (omission of domain data reduced performance
measures by 5—10%). This shows that the use of a large number
of datasets leads to substantial redundancy in information, and that
the classiﬁer is robust to the inclusion of less predictive datasets.

We then investigated the functional clusters most accurately
predicted by PAGODA (accuracy deﬁned as where at least three-
quarters of predictions for that cluster are in the top 3). Molecular
function, biological process and cellular component were more
accurate for the most speciﬁc clusters (Supplementary Tables 4—6).
This is contrast to the overall accuracy of PAGODA, which performs
better at more general clusters. This, in part, may be due to the small
number of proteins in the clusters at these levels, therefore, meaning
only a couple of genes needed to be predicted correctly for the cluster
to be counted as accurately predicted, but can most probably be
explained by a small number of highly speciﬁc functional clusters for
which predictions are particularly accurate. This was especially true
for molecular function compared with biological process and cellular
component. Although the well-predicted clusters covered a wide
range of functions, ﬁinctions and processes relating to translation,
DNA replication, processes involving RNA, and invasion and
interaction with the parasite’s host seemed to be particularly well
predicted.

We then examined GO clusters that were predicted accurately
by multiple datasets (deﬁned as three or more) as shown in
Supplementary Tables 7—9. PAGODA predicted the most GO
clusters in molecular function and showed a preference for
predicting smaller, more speciﬁc, GO clusters. Signiﬁcantly,
fewer clusters were predicted in biological process and cellular
component (cellular component=32, biological process: 36,
molecular function = 60) and more general functional clusters were
preferred. More speciﬁcally, in the biological process category,
PAGODA predicts most accurately proteins involved in the
processing of RNA and proteins involved with cell invasion and
interaction with cells in the host wall, while in the cellular
component category, proteins in or near chromosomes and proteins
in the translation initiation complexes were best predicted.

3.1 Case study: translation initiation factors and
erythrocyte invasion

The translation of mRNA into proteins proceeds through the three
major steps of initiation, elongation and termination. Translation
initiation involves the binding of the Met-tRNA to the small
ribosomal subunit, and then this to the mRNA followed by
the joining of the large ribosomal subunit (Acker and Lorsch,
2008). To perform this, a large number of eukaryotic translation
initiation factors (TIFs) are required. The number of proteins
required for translation initiation varies between species, with
many of the TIFs being multi-subunit proteins (Rodnina and
Wintermeyer, 2009). Also, Plasmodium is particularly unusual in
expressing different rRNAs at different stages of its life cycle with

Pfalciparum producing asexual and sporozoite rRNA (McCutchan
et (11., 1995). The precise proteins involved in translation is still
not well understood and the difﬁculty of experimentally verifying
annotations in Plasmodium has meant the TIF annotations in
Pfalciparum have mostly be assigned by homology methods, with
certain TIF believed to exist but yet to be identiﬁed (Ginsburg, 2006).

Proteins involved in translation in P.f(11cip(1rum were predicted
accurately by several of the datasets in PAGODA (Supplementary
Table 10) with 10 of the 12 TIFs in Pfalciparum correctly predicted
by the combined method in PAGODA. Therefore, we investigated
the proteins involved in translation initiation to see if PAGODA
could improve the current annotations for TIF in P. falciparum.
Another well predicted but far from completely understood process
in Rfalciparum is the invasion of the host cell. A similar process to
that described below for translation initiation was also conducted and
is outlined in Supplementary Materials. We describe 19 genes that
are likely to be involved in invasion of the host cell and investigate
3 of these genes in more detail.

PAGODA was run for biological process at level 6 speciﬁcity, the
level of the ﬁinctional cluster translational initiation (GO:0006413),
on genes that did not have a manually curated GO biological process
annotations in GeneDB (Hertz-Fowler et (11., 2004). Genes that were
predicted to be TIFs with an NES > 2 (this corresponded to 4.53%
of genes at this level) and included at least one gene pair with a
probability greater than 0.85 were extracted and this produced a list
of 18 genes (Supplementary Table 11) most likely to be involved in
translation initiation.

Encouragingly, ﬁve of these genes are already annotated
as ribosomal genes (PFl3_0228, PFC0775w, MALl3Pl .209,
PFl3_0268 and PFl4_0230) using the non-manually curated IEAs
and one protein (PF10_0103) had also been putatively annotated as
a TIF in the most recent GeneDB annotations, corroborating our
predictions.

Proteins involved in translation often show highly correlated
patterns of expression (Webb and Westhead, 2009) and in
P. falciparum the microarray-based methods, especially the Bozdech
microarray data, are the most informative in predicting the annotated
TIFs. This high level of correlation is also seen in the 18 proteins
predicted to be involved in translation initiation, e.g. for the
hypothetical protein PFL0155c, seven of the eight most correlated
genes in the Bozdech microarray data are proteins involved in
translation (Supplementary Fig. l and Supplementary Table 12).
Three RNA helicases are also in the list of 18 proteins predicted to
be involved in translation initiation. RNA helicases unwind RNA
strands and are known to be involved in translation (Sonenberg and
Hinnebusch, 2009). Again, with these RNA helicases we see high
levels of correlation with proteins involved in translation, e.g. 7 out
of the 10 genes most correlated with the RNA helicase PFB0445c in
the Bozdech microarray data are genes involved in translation and
all are correlated with a Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient greater than
0.95 as shown in Table 1.

One of the most interesting proteins predicted to be involved in
translation initiation is the protein PFD0880w. PlasmoDB annotates
the protein as a proteasome regulatory component, possibly because
the protein contains the Proteasome component region domain
(IPR0007 l 7). The Plasmodium biological pathway database Malaria
Parasite Metabolic Pathways (Ginsburg, 2006) agrees with this
annotation and annotates the protein as a lid subunit of the
proteasome, involved in the proteasome-mediated proteolysis of

ubiquinated proteins. Despite PAGODA, using domain information
it does not predict the protein to be involved in protein degradation
but instead predicts the protein to be involved in translation
initiation, based on other TIF containing that domain (PFL0310c
and PFE01405c), strong correlation with other TIF in the Bozdech
microarray (r>0.95) and Affymetrix microarray (r>0.91) data.
To evaluate our prediction, we performed a BLAST search of
PFD0880w against Swiss-Prot and also looked at the fold of
the protein using GenTHREADER (McGufﬁn and Jones, 2003).
BLAST results showed strong sequence similarity to Eukaryotic
TIFs 3 subunit m (E-value: 3 X 10_30). This protein was also
originally annotated as a proteasome protein until Zhou et (11.
(2005a) showed it was involved in translation and particularly
involved in translation in certain mRNAs. This role in allowing
certain mRNAs to be translated is corroborated by the fold of the
protein, which is predicted to be a three-domain protein consisting of
the Anticodon-binding domain (SCOP ID = b.40.4.1), GAD domain
(SCOP ID = d.74.4.1) and Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-like,
catalytic domain (SCOP ID = d. 104.1.1). GenTHREADER predicts
only two other Pfalciparum proteins with this fold, both of which
are involved in translation (the asparagine—tRNA ligase PFE0715w
and phenylalanyl—tRNA synthetase subunit PFF0180w). Both these
proteins are involved in joining tRNA molecules to their speciﬁc
amino acid suggesting PFD0880w/ETIF3m may have a similar role.

3.2 Comparison with existing Rfalciparum gene
function prediction

Most attempts to predict gene ﬁinction in P.f(11cip(1rum either rely
on just one source of data (Zhou et (11., 2005b) or do not produce
a combined prediction through a machine learning method (Tedder
et (11., 2010; Zhou et (11., 2008). Here, we compare PAGODA with
Plasmodraft, a program that predicts the ﬁinction of unannotated
Pfalciparum genes (Brehelin et (11., 2008) using multiple sources of
data and combining them using a KNN approach. Direct comparison
between gene ﬁinction prediction programs is difﬁcult, with there
being differences in annotation sets (Plasmodraft uses all the GO
annotations, while PAGODA excludes IEAs) and differences in the
datasets used. However, we attempt to compare the methods by
evaluating the accuracy of the programs’ most conﬁdent predictions
for annotated genes. The Plasmodraft website includes a ﬁle
containing its most conﬁdent predictions and these predictions
were compared to the high-conﬁdence predictions of the PAGODA

combined method (a high-conﬁdence prediction was deﬁned as a
gene that had a NES > 1.5 at any speciﬁcity level, with the most
detailed prediction taken if the NES was greater than 1.5 at more
than one level). The predictions produced by each method were
then evaluated against the actual annotations of Pfalciparum genes
using the Lord et (11. (2003) method and the coverage calculated as
the number of genes with a prediction divided by the total number
of annotated Pfalciparum genes for that GO class. Figures 3 and 4
show the mean of these measurements, and as can be seen, PAGODA
produces more predictions at a greater accuracy than that of the
Plasmodraft.

3.3 PAGODA web-tool: an integrated gene function
prediction website tool for Rfalciparum

As the majority of Pfalciparum genes either have no annotation

or lack a detailed annotation, we have built a web tool based on

the PAGODA algorithm to allow the prediction of the ﬁinction of

any Pfalciparum gene. The results for P.f(11cip(1rum genes with a

manually annotated GO annotation have been pre-calculated and are
available to download. For unannotated genes, a prediction can also
be produced. The unannotated query gene is treated as the ‘left out’
gene in the PAGODA method. The gene IDs of PlasmoDB are used
(if the user is unsure of this ID they can search the names, aliases,
notes and descriptions of all P.f(11cip(1rum genes from PlasmoDB on
the front page of the PAGODA).

Input consists of the gene, the GO class and the speciﬁcity
level at which to run the prediction program. Once the process
is completed the user is presented with a descending list of all
the functional clusters at that speciﬁcity level and their respective
NES scores indicating how likely the gene has that ﬁinctional
annotation. PAGODA is available at http://www.bioinformatics.
leeds.ac.uk/~bio5pmrt/PAGODA/.

4 CONCLUSONS

Eight years after the sequencing of the P.f(11cip(1rum genome, the
majority of P.f(11cip(1rum genes remain as unknown function. Gene
ﬁinction prediction programs have shown their ability to work but
have been mainly designed for well-annotated model organisms that
have large amounts of the training data. In this work. we create a
gene function prediction program using a wide range of datasets
combined using a novel sophisticated machine learning algorithm.
We use a semantic similarity measure on GO annotations, which
circumvents the problem of GO annotations that are very close on
the GO graph but are biologically speaking quite different. This
measure is then used to cluster genes, thereby taking into account
the interdependence of GO terms and with the use of the GSEA to
remove arbitrary cut-offs, such as those used in KNN approaches,
we produce a greater number of predictions with greater accuracy;
and with the example of PFD0880w we show that PAGODA can
actually improve on the current annotations of P.f(11cip(1rum many
of which are just inferred through sequence similarity.

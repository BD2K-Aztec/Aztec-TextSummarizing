Abstract

Motivation: Robustness, the ability of biological networks to uphold their functionality in spite of
perturbations, is a key characteristic of all living systems. Although several theoretical approaches
have been developed to formalize robustness, it still eludes an exact quantification. Here, we pre—
sent a rigorous and quantitative approach for the structural robustness of metabolic networks by
measuring their ability to tolerate random reaction (or gene) knockouts.

Results: In analogy to reliability theory, based on an explicit consideration of all possible knockout
sets, we exactly quantify the probability of failure for a given network function (e.g. growth). This
measure can be computed if the network’s minimal cut sets (MSCs) are known. We show that even
in genome—scale metabolic networks the probability of (network) failure can be reliably estimated
from MSCs with lowest cardinalities. We demonstrate the applicability of our theory by analyzing
the structural robustness of multiple Enterobacteriaceae and Blattibacteriaceae and show a dra—
matically low structural robustness for the latter. We find that structural robustness develops from
the ability to proliferate in multiple growth environments consistent with experimentally found
knowledge.

Conclusion: The probability of (network) failure provides thus a reliable and easily computable
measure of structural robustness and redundancy in (genome—scale) metabolic networks.

1 Introduction

 

A major characteristic of biological systems is their ‘robustness’,
i.e. the ability to perform normally under the presence of perturb—
ations (Kitano, 2002). Despite its fundamental importance, robust—
ness is hard to quantify and a comprehensive, quantitative
understanding of robustness has yet to be developed (Kitano,
2007). The problem is augmented by the fact that robustness is an
extremely general concept which obstructs efforts for an exact

definition (Stelling et (11., 2004). Clearly, robustness arises as a con—
sequence of the interactions between the components in a system.
It therefore requires a network—based approach for its analysis
(Larhlimi et (11., 2011).

In the following, we study a key aspect of cellular robustness,
namely structural robustness in metabolic networks (Wilhelm et
(11., 2004), which is a measure of the apparent redundancy in
metabolic networks. Redundancy is one reason why specific

(network) functions may persist in spite of changes in the net—
works’ topologies. Metabolic networks are particularly suitable
to study structural robustness as their topologies are either
well known or can be reliably reconstructed by well—estab—
lished protocols (Thiele and Palsson, 2010; Vlassis et (11.,
2014).

An unbiased way to characterize all topologically feasible ﬂux
distributions in a metabolic network can be achieved in terms of
elementary ﬂux modes (EFMs) (Schuster et (11., 2000). EFMs are
steady—state pathways that use a minimal set of reactions (enzymes)
in the appropriate thermodynamic directions. Biologically, they can
be interpreted as simple, indivisible functional building blocks,
which represent all feasible metabolic capabilities of the organism.
Thus, EFMs are likely candidates to be used in a definition of struc—
tural robustness. In fact, Wilhelm et al. (2004) were the first to de—
fine structural robustness by counting the number of EFMs in
different situations.

An alternative approach to EFMs is minimal cut sets (MCSs)
(Klamt and Gilles, 2004). These are minimal sets of reaction (en—
zyme) knockouts that completely disable a particular network
functionality. MCSs are intimately connected to EFMs. Any net—
work function can be represented by a set of EFMs. Thus, MCSs
can equivalently be defined as the minimal set of reaction knock—
outs that prevent a set of target EFMs from carrying a steady—
state ﬂux. An MCS is therefore a so—called minimal hitting set of
the target EFMs (Klamt, 2006). If the EFMs or the MCSs are
known, the respective other can be calculated. Mathematically,
this relationship is known as duality (Berge, 1989). While EFMs
describe the possibilities to achieve a particular function, MCSs
describe the effort it takes to remove that function from the net—
work. Thus, the size distribution of the MCSs provides a meas—
ure for the structural fragility of a network (Klamt and Gilles,
2004).

One major disadvantage for both measures, the EFM—based
structural robustness measure as well as the MCS—based struc—
tural fragility measure, is that they presuppose the availability
of the complete set of EFMs and MCSs, respectively. This is a
computationally intractable problem in genome—scale metabolic
models (GSMMs).

Here, we present a novel method that overcomes the computa—
tional limitations and allows one for the first time to estimate the
structural robustness even in GSMMs. We use MCSs to calculate
the exact (structural) probability of failure (PoF) of a network. This
puts the estimation of structural robustness on a theoretically sound
fundament.

2 Theory

We consider a metabolic network made up of m (internal) metabol—
ites and r reactions. The network contains 71 EFMs. We use the sup—
port representation E : supp(e) to uniquely characterize an EFM, e.
E is the set of all (reaction) indices 1' for which the EFM vector e car—
ries any ﬂux, i.e. supp(e) : {ilei 9E 0}, with 1 S i S r. We collect all
EFMs in the setg : {E1, ... ,En}.

If we delete d reactions, several EFMs will get disabled. We repre—
sent a set of d deleted reactions by a cut set (CS) Cd of cardinality d.
Cd contains the set of (reaction) indices that get deleted. A CS Cd dis—
ables all EFMs involving any of the d deleted reactions. To study the
impact of a deletion strategy, Cd, on the network, we collect all EFMs
not affected by Cd in the set of the remaining EFMs,

ézcd : {E E aﬂcd O E : 0}. The complement of $01 is denoted by
W01 and contains all EFMs that are disabled by Cd: W01 : g \ ézcd .
A minimal (irreducible) set of reaction (enzyme) deletions that com—
pletely disables a given set of target EFMs, .9", is called an MCS, M
(Klamt and Gilles, 2004). For any target set .9" we collect all u MCSs

in the set of MCSs, J! : {M1,  ,MM}. Finally, we collect all

r
1 S i S b : (d) possible CSs C21 of cardinality d in the set of C55,

(6d:{C‘f,  ,cg}.

2.1 Structural robustness: R(d)

For a given number d of deletions, Behre et al. (2008) defined the
network’s structural robustness R(d) as the average ratio of the
number of remaining EFMs to the total number of EFMs over all
possible combinations of exactly d knockouts, i.e.

1 I’Kdl ‘gqi‘

R(d) :: @ i:1 

(1)
We show in the Supplementary material that the network’s

structural robustness only depends on the cardinality of the net—
work’s EFMs and can easily be calculated for any number of de—

letionsdby

mm) 2< . >- 

Thus, network structural robustness is merely determined by the
EFMs’ length.

2.2 POF: F(d)

For a given number of deletions, d, we define the network’s PoF,
F(d), as the ratio of the number of CSs that disable a particular net—
work objective, obj, to the total number of all possible combinations
of exactly d knockouts, i.e.

i Igzm‘l

Fobi(d): ‘(gd‘ .

 

(3)

CSs that disable a particular objective (i.e. the elements of
(62,”) are either MCSs or supersets of MCSs disabling ‘obj’. We
show in the Supplementary material that the POP can be calcu—
lated by

Fond): r 4 Z (—1)V"1 PW . (4)
I ‘1 0¢]§{1,..,,,.} d-IMJI

where M] : 'U M,- and ] is a (multi)—index over all power sets of the
indices {1, . 16],;1} of the set .1! of MCSs blocking ‘obj’.

Note that the definition of the POP requires specification of an
objective, that can be the operation of the whole system or of a par—
ticular function. A typical cellular function is the production of bio—
mass (BM). Thus, FBM(d) measures the probability that the deletion
of d reactions is lethal. In what follows we will drop the index for
the objective and implicitly assume that the production of BM is tar—
geted, unless stated otherwise.

2.3 Overall structural robustness R and overall PoF
(OPoF) E

Both R(d) and E(d) are defined for a specific number of reaction de—
letions. Following Behre et al. (2008), we define the overall struc—

tural robustness, R, if at most (all) r reactions are knocked out, as
the weighted sum of all possible R(d) (Behre et al., 2008),

ﬁzzy/51201). (5)
d:1
Analogous to the structural robustness we define the OPoF, E as
F ;: ngmd). (6)
d:1
Behre et al. (2008) suggested to use the following weights
r
14:5 :: (d>pdwithp—\'/2—1. (7)

However, their choice is difficult to interpret in terms of a probabil—
ity distribution. That is why we opted for an appropriately selected
probability distribution function for the calculation of E. 105 may be
naturally modeled by a binomial distribution,

, 1’
w; 2: (Jim 47)”. (8)

which estimates the number of loss—of—function mutations with
exactly d reaction deletions assuming a constant (reaction) mutation
rate 17. In typical metabolic networks, the number of reactions r is
large and the mutation rate is small. We therefore approximate the
binomial distribution with the simpler Poisson distribution,

to; ;: Adexp(—/l)/(dl), (9)

with A : rp. R(d), R, E(d) and E all range between 0 and 1.
However, while R : 1 indicates a totally robust network, E : 1 de—
notes the reverse, a completely fragile network.

3 Implementation and computation

The computation of the structural robustness R(d) according to
Equation (2) is straight forward as long as the complete set of EFMs

is known. The computation of the POP is computationally more de—
manding as the number of summands in the sum of Equation (4) ex—
plodes combinatorially. In the following, we will outline
countermeasures to estimate the POP even in GSMMs.

Exact quantification of cellular robustness

Algorithm 1 implements Equation (4) by calculating the total
number of CSs for given deletions d in a recursive way. The number
of reactions in the model, as well as all mcs with a cardinality up to
the current number of reaction deletions are needed for the calcula—
tion. The algorithm calculates the number of all possible CSs for a
single MCS by the function CHOOSE, which computes the binomial
r — comde

d — comde

deletions resulting from the combination of MCSs. In order to avoid

coefficient for < >, where comde is the number of

the consideration of a CS multiple times those CSs that have already
been calculated by other MCS, indicated by their index, are sub—
tracted. This is done by creating an intermediate CS by a logical OR
operation and then following the inclusion—exclusion principal
(Ryser, 1963) in a recursive procedure.

Algorithm 1 was implemented as multi—threaded C program which
is available at https://github.com/mpgerstl/networkRobustnessToolbox.

In the following analysis, we used A : 0.5, unless stated otherwise.

4.1 E reliably identifies structural fragility

We used a medium—scale metabolic model (MSMM) that describes
the core metabolism of Escherichia coli (see Table 1 for an overview
of the topological properties of the models used) to study the inﬂu—
ence of the carbon source on the structural robustness and the PoF

Fig. 1. Number of recursions in Algorithm 1 as function of the number of reac-
tion deletions, devaluated for the model ECochore+glc in different computa-
tion scenarios. In addition, we plotted the number of MOS (dotted line) as
function of their cardinality for the model used

(see Table 2). In all cases, a complete EFM and MCS analysis was
feasible.

We found that both measures indicated a strong impact of the
carbon sources although with opposing trends. The OPoF was low—
est for growth on glucose and highest for growth on acetate. We
observed that in all three growth environments the PoFs E(d) could
be well approximated (coefficient of determination, R2 > 0.999) by
«[1 — ﬁexp(—yd)] with three free parameters at, l)’ and y (see
Supplementary Fig. S1). R however ranked growth on acetate to be
most robust and growth on glucose or glycerol similarly robust but
far behind growth on acetate. According to Equation (2) this implied
that for acetate EFMs were on average shorter then for glucose (see
Supplementary Fig. S2). Finally, the simple ratio between the num—
ber of BM producing EFMs and the total number of EFMs revealed
yet another ranking with the highest ratio for growth on glycerol
and the lowest ratio for growth on acetate (see Supplementary Table
S2). Comparing the different measures, we found that only the
OPoF scored the (lack of) structural robustness in E. coli consist—
ently to previous analysis (Klamt and Gilles, 2004; Stelling et al.,
2002).

4.2 R and E can be calculated exactly in MSMMs

Judged by the number of EFMs, the three growth models signifi—
cantly differed in size (see Table 1). Yet all structural robustness—
values were calculated within few seconds for any number of reac—
tion deletions. As the number of summands in Equation (4) grew
excessively for high number of reaction deletions, d, the calcula—
tion of E(d) was more demanding. We found an exponential in—
crease in the number of recursions for Algorithm 1 (see Fig. 1).
Our optimized implementation scaled consistently better than that
and allowed us to evaluate E(d) in the largest model,
ECo1Di_core+glc, up to d:9 in< 10min using 10 threads on an
Intel CoreTM i7—3930 K with two CPUs a six cores and 3.20 GHz
operated with Ubuntu 12.04.

4.3 R and F are determined by the first few deletions

We analyzed the contribution of higher—order deletions to the over—
all structural robustness and OPoF, respectively. In the best case
higher—order terms R(d) and E(d) vanish for d > do causing no error
in the sums of Equations (5) and (6). In the worst case higher—order

We found that the resulting maximum error dropped quickly
with do even in huge GSMMs (see Fig. 2). For instance, for 2 g 1 the
8 drops below 10’4 if all MCSs up to cardinality six are known.
Thus, we conclude that for practical means the overall structural ro—
bustness R and the OPoF F can be approximated by the first few
terms in their respective sums

d:1 d:1

For fixed 2 the OPoF F depends only on the do smallest MCS and
consistently converges toward its true value with increasing MCS car—
dinality. In the E. coli example used above (see Table 2), all MCSs up
to cardinality 4 were sufficient to estimate E within an error of 0.02
percentage points. However, a similar argument for the overall struc—
tural robustness R is not available. The knowledge of the do shortest
EFMs does not allow one to accurately estimate R. Supplementary
Figure S5 illustrates the error in the overall structural robustness as
function of the do shortest EFMs for the E. coli model used above. In
that case, >55% of all EFMs were required to get within a 10% error
margin.

4.4 For small 2., E is well approximated in GSMMs
According to Equation (11), the OPoF could be estimated if all low
cardinality MCSs were known. Recently, Von Kamp and Klamt
(2014) showed that it is in fact possible to enumerate the smallest
MCSs in GSMMs. In the following, we used their approach to calcu—
late low cardinality MCSs.

We calculated all lethal MCSs up to a cardinality of 4 in
GSMMs of three E. coli strains growing on minimal medium and
glucose or melibiose as the sole carbon source and estimated the
OPoF (see Table 3). The models represented E. coli K—12 MG1655
(iJOl366), the pathogenic enterohemorrhagic E. coli 0157:H7
Sakai (iECs_1301) and the Shigella ﬂexneri 2a 2457T (iS_1188).

Comparing the three organisms against each other revealed
that growth on glucose is more failsafe than growth on the alternative
carbon source melibiose. In fact, growth on glucose (and glucose 1—
phosphate) was found to be more robust than on any other single, ni—
trogen—free carbon source (see Supplementary Fig. S4). The two E. coli
were similarly robust (with a small advantage for E. coli K—12
MG1655), while the S. ﬂexneri was most fragile. Although the

For the GSMMs the OPoFs were estimated by considering all synthetic le-
thals of groups of up to do = 4 reactions and 2. = 0.5. For these settings the es—

difference in the OPoF was small, it is indicative as the difference in F
for any two models is larger than 8(4). We observed the same trend not
only for F but also for E(d) for all tested cardinalities d S 4, as well.
The GSMMs were also found to be more robust than the E. coli core
model. Again, in all models, E(d) could be nicely approximated by
«[1 — liexp(—yd)] (see Supplementary Table S4).

Finally, we calculated all synthetic lethal reactions in groups of
up to do : 6 reaction deletions and evaluated the OPoF in the
GSMMs of the endosymbiotic Blattabacterinm cuenoti Bge
(iCG238 + full) and B. cuenoti Pam (iCG230 + full), see Table 4, for
full growth media containing all nutrients that were possibly taken
up, see Supplementary Table S1 for detailed media compositions.
Both strains were found to be extremely fragile with OPoFs > 26%
and a maximal inaccuracy of 1 X 10‘4 percentage points. Any three
reaction deletions almost certainly killed these two strains (with a
small chance of survival of <5 %).

4.5 Gene—centric PoFs showed same behavior as
reaction—centric PoFs

For simplicity so far we analyzed structural robustness from a reac—
tion—centric (RC) viewpoint. However, it is possible to change from
an RC to a gene—centric (GC) viewpoint while retaining our formal—
ism for the PoF calculation. PoF only requires the calculation of
MCSs. These can be calculated in an RC model as well as in a GC
model provided that a gene—reaction mapping is available as
Boolean function of the genes (as it is typically the case). GC MCSs
consider the effect of gene knock—outs on reactions based on the
evaluation of the provided Boolean rules. If the complete set of
EFMs is known, GC MCSs can be calculated using an established in—
teger programming procedure (Jungreuthmayer and Zanghellini,
2012). In GSMMs, where the complete set of EFMs is unavailable,
the dual systems approach (von Kamp and Klamt, 2014) can be

adopted to compute GC MCSs. The common dual approach calcu—
lates RC MCSs (ordered by ascending cardinality) by iteratively
solving a mixed integer linear program (MILP) (De Figueiredo et al.,
2009). In order to obtain a GC MCS instead of an RC MCS the
gene—reaction association has to be integrated into the MILP, which
can be achieved by means of the so—called indicator constraints.
These concepts are provided by modern MILP solvers, which allow
for the Boolean coupling of reactions and their associated genes.

We evaluated GC PoFs for models listed in Table 1 and com—
pared them against the corresponding RC PoFs (see Table 5). We
found comparable (O)PoF values except for the MSMM of E. coli,
where we observed larger differences. Yet the absolute ranking of
the organisms with respect to structural robustness remained un—
changed no matter if the GC or RC PoF was used.

5 Discussion

Here, we developed a new general measure to quantify the structural
robustness (or fragility) of metabolic networks based on the (O)PoF.
Both, PoF E(d) as well as OPoF F are based on MCSs and share anal—
ogies with the previously defined structural robustness measures
R(d) and R which rely on EFMs (Behre et al., 2008). In contrast to
R, the OPoF remains computationally feasible even in GSMMs for
two reasons: (i) the OPoF can be well estimated from the shortest
MCSs with up to do reaction cuts; and (ii) these do shortest MCSs
can be calculated with a MILP even in GSMMs (von Kamp and
Klamt, 2014). Previously, it was shown that MCSs in the (primal)
network are EFMs in a network dual to the original network
(Ballerstein et al., 2012). Thus, finding the shortest EFMs in this
dual network is equivalent to finding the low cardinality MCSs in
the primal GSMM (von Kamp and Klamt, 2014). A high perform—
ance computing infrastructure is not required for this task. Thus, the
OPoF is in principle an easily computable measure. However, due to
the combinatorial explosion of the number of summands in E(d), see
Equation (4), the evaluation is practically limited to low cardinal—
ities. This does not cause practical problems for the OPoF E as the
impact of high—cardinality MCSs on F quickly decreases (see Fig. 2).
The slope of this decrease depends on the selected probability dens—
ity that models the number of deletions that occur per mutation.
Here, we used a Poisson distribution which is typically used for the
study of rare events, like mutations (Lee et al., 2012, and references
therein). We were able to show that up to 2 S 1 our analysis is com—
putationally feasible on standard computer infrastructure. This is
sufficient for the study of naturally occurring mutations. For in—
stance, in E. coli a mutation rate of about 10‘3 per genome and gen—
eration was found (Lee et al., 2012), which is far below our limit of
2 S 1, as we can assume that not all mutations lead to a loss of func—
tion of metabolic enzymes. All our conclusions remained valid (data
not shown) if we used other probability densities like a binomial dis—
tribution or the one used by Behre et al. (2008), see Equation (7).

Previously, MCSs were already used to compute a so—called fra—
gility coefficient which characterized the sensitivity of a metabolic
network to deletions (Klamt, 2006; Klamt and Gilles, 2004).
Fragility was defined for each reaction as the inverse of the average
cardinality of all MCSs that were supported by that reaction. Upon
averaging the reaction—specific fragility over all reactions one ob—
tained a measure for the overall network fragility. In contrast to the
here introduced concept of the OPoF, network fragility lacks a rigor—
ous probabilistic definition and more importantly requires the com—
plete set of MCSs for its calculation. Network fragility is therefore
not applicable to GSMMs.

A clear difference between the PoF and structural robustness is
that the former is function oriented while the latter characterizes
the network. F is calculated with respect to some particular func—
tion that fails. Typically, networks perform multiple functions at
the same time, which may be differentially robust. Thus, the OPoF
is not only a topological property but also a property of the associ—
ated function. For instance, it is interesting to ask (and scope of
further analysis) whether two essential functions like cellular en—
ergy production and BM production are similarly robust. R on the
other hand characterizes the network topology by essentially meas—
uring the proportion of short EFMs in a network. This definition is
independent of any functions performed by the network. R coun—
terintuitively identified growth on acetate to be more robust than
growth on glucose which indicates that the length of EFMs may
not be an appropriate proxy for structural robustness. Even if we
selected only those EFMs that support a particular target function
(like BM production), and calculated R for the reduced set of
EFMs, we had misidentified growth on acetate as the most robust
growth environment as growth supporting EFMs on acetate were
on average ‘shorter’ than on glucose (see Supplementary Fig. S2).
For better understanding we illustrated this effect in a toy network
in Supplementary Figure S3. Thus, we propose to use the comple—
ment of the OPoF: Rnew : 1 — F as a new measure for structural
robustness in metabolic networks.

PoFs can be calculated equally well on the basis of reaction dele—
tions as well as on the basis of gene deletions. Some reactions in an
organism are not associated with a gene (e.g. non—catalyzed reac—
tions, reactions with unknown annotations) and can therefore not
be knocked out. Other reactions are catalyzed by several different
enzymes and are therefore more difficult to knock—out. However,
our analysis indicates that the question if an organism or a growth
condition is more robust than another can be identically answered
in both approaches.

It was criticized that structural robustness (as defined by Behre et
al., 2008) lacks the ability to identify critical enzymes, such as knot
enzymes (Min et al., 2011). This is true for the OPoF as well. For in—
stance, according to our measure, network A in Figure 3 was cor—
rectly identified to be more robust than network B. The cause for
the lack of structural robustness is not apparent from the numerical
value of the OPoF. Min et al. (2011) proposed to solve this dilemma
by considering the number of independent (i.e. non—overlapping)
EFMs, which are not available in GSMMs. However, by measuring
the specific PoF fR(d) for each individual reaction (enzyme) R we
are at least able to identify critical enzymes. For this purpose, we de—
fine the (reaction) specific PoF fR (d)

d
fr(d) 2:ﬂ (12)

to be the ratio between all specific CSs, 6%, that are supported by reac—
tion R and the number of all possible CSs, (dd (and similarly for 17R).
By ranking reactions according to their impact on the network we are
able to identify critical reactions which may be useful drug targets.
We calculated OPoFs in MSMMs and GSMMs of multiple
Enterohacteriaceae growing on minimal media to illustrate our con—
cept. Among these, the ordinary lab strain E. coli K—12 MG1655 grow—
ing on glucose was found to be most robust. This was consistently
observed in MSMMs and GSMMs in agreement with expectations
(Stelling et al., 2002). Moreover, catabolite repression mechanisms sup—
port this observation of glucose as a preferential growth source.
Escherichia coli K—12 MG1655 was also found to be more ro—
bust than the pathogenic E. coli 0157:H7 Sakai, and the least

robust S. ﬂexneri 2a 2457T. While the difference between K—12
MG1655 and 0157:H7 Sakai was small (but larger than the pos—
sible error), S. flexneri was clearly set apart. Due to its adaption to a
specific growth niche, S. ﬂexneri has lost many catabolic pathways
for various nutrient sources (Bliven and Maurelli, 2012). It was
demonstrated computationally as well as experimentally that the
number of growth—supporting conditions is larger for E. coli K—12
MG1655 than for E. coli 0157:H7 Sakai than for S. ﬂexneri 2a
2457T (Monk et al., 2013). In contrast we here investigated the
OPoF as a measure of structural robustness for these organisms in a
single growth condition. Yet we found the same ranking as obtained
from counting the number of growth—supporting conditions.
Structural robustness is thought to come about from the need to sur—
vive in multiple environments. Many of these adaptations occur
through rewiring of existing enzymes (Wagner, 2013), thus increas—
ing the connectivity in the network, and—as a byproduct—also
introducing many alternative routes. These topological alternatives
can be exploited for other growth sources as well and were mirrored
in our analysis in low OPoFs.

The two strains of the highly specialized endosymbiont B. cuenoti,
which for millions of years have lived in the relatively constant envir—
onment provided by specialized cells of cockroaches (Lo et al., 2007),
were found to be extremely sensitive to loss—of—function mutations
(Gonzalez—Domenech et al., 2012). This was confirmed by an ex—
tremely high OPoF of >26%. B. cuenoti was more than three times
less robust than E. coli. It is known that B. cuenoti grows only on an
extremely limited palette of metabolic substrates (Sabree et al., 2009),
which results in their low structural robustness as documented here.
Consistent with our findings above on S. ﬂexneri this lack of structural
robustness is thought to be shaped by massive gene loss (Sabree et al.,
2010). A characteristic difference between B. cuenoti Pam and Bge is a
defunct TCA cycle in the former due to the absence of the first three
enzymatic steps (Gonzalez—Domenech et al., 2012). This fact was mir—
rored in a lower structural robustness of B. cuenoti Pam compared
with Bge. Thus, we conclude that the OPoF is indeed an appropriate
measure to correctly assess the structural robustness of cells.

Here, we analyzed the structural robustness of multiple organ—
isms in several growth environments. Consistent with previous find—
ings our results confirm that structural robustness is correlated with
the ability to utilize multiple carbon sources (Papp et al., 2004).
They concluded that structural robustness is not a trait selected by
evolution but a byproduct of environmental ﬂexibility. However,
very recently Yang et al. (2015) showed that structural redundancy
also impacts a cell factory’s ability to produce a product of interest
in the presence of perturbations. Based on predictions from
GSMMs, they argue that pathway diversification leads to robust
production capabilities under large perturbations. For instance, we
show in Supplementary Table S5 two strain designs with different
OPoFs but identical production/growth characteristics. Thus, calcu—
lating the OPoF will identify promising designs for cell factories.

Interestingly, we found that the raise in E(d) with increasing d was
well approximated by an exponential function in all investigated
models and independent of the investigated organism. Whether this is
an expression of some general topological properties of metabolic net—
works or a coincidence will be scope of further work.

6 Conclusion

We developed a consistent theory of cellular redundancy based on a
rigorous probabilistic definition of failure in metabolic networks.
The new measure, called OPoF, allows quantification of the struc—
tural robustness of biochemical reaction networks with respect to
certain functionalities. OPoF can be reliably estimated—even in
GSMMs—from low cardinality MSCs. In contrast to other meas—
ures, the OPoF quantifies structural robustness and fragility of cellu—
lar metabolism concurrent with current biological paradigms and
experimental findings. More specifically we showed that the number
of growth—supporting nutrients indirectly correlates with the organ—
isms’ OPoF. As the OPoF is easily computable, we expect that it will
be useful in increasing our understanding of key properties of meta—
bolic networks.

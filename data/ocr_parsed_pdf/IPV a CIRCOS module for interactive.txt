Abstract

Summary: Today’s genome browsers and protein databanks supply vast amounts of information
about proteins. The challenge is to concisely bring together this information in an interactive and
easy to generate format.

Availability and implementation: We have developed an interactive CIRCOS module called i—PV to
visualize user supplied protein sequence, conservation and SNV data in a live presentable format.

l—PV can be downloaded from http://www.i—pv.org.

1 Introduction

Today’s genome browsers and protein databanks supply vast
amount of information about both the structural annotation and the
single nucleotide variants (SNV) in genes. The challenge is to con—
cisely bring together this information in an interactive and easy to
generate format. Several freeware and commercial visualization
tools are available nowadays. CIRCOS is one of these tools which is
largely adopted and utilized in the field of genomics (Krzywinski
et (11., 2009). It generates clear and human readable data visualiza—
tion in a circular layout. Moreover, due to its circular layout, it has
a much higher compression rate of space required per datum com—
pared to classic rectangular representations. However, images gener—
ated in CIRCOS are static and requires a specific input file format.
We have developed an interactive CIRCOS module called i—PV to
visualize user supplied protein sequence, conservation and SNV data
while significantly easing and automating input file requirements
and generation. All elements rendered in i—PV are interactive with
mouse—over explanations and clickable buttons. It allows selective
display/hiding of amino acid sequence, SNV, conservation and
amino acid properties. This may be very beneficial for having novel

insights into one’s protein of interest (P01) and convey the informa—
tion efficiently for researchers. I—PV can be downloaded from http://
www.i—pv.org.

2 Methods

To use i—PV, only four text files (with ‘.txt’ extension) have to be sup—
plied to the software: conservation scores, protein and cDNA se—
quences and SNVs/Indels files (Supplementary Fig. S4). Protein and
cDNA (or mRNA) sequence files are supplied in fasta format whereas
SNP/Indel flles are provided as annotated variant call format (vcf) file.
The conservation scores are simply array of numbers separated by
newline characters. The input files are supplied to i—PV, data are auto—
matically checked for errors or duplicates and matched against the
user provided fasta files, and then an interactive html file containing
the graph is automatically generated as shown in Figure 1.

I—PV rendering works without problems in chrome 37.0. Minor
browser side bugs about rendering SVG elements exist in firefox
32.0.3, explorer 11 and safari 5.1.7.

User defined regions are marked with custom name tag and mouse over in-
formation. (P) Meta-analysis of amino acid distributions. This information is
only displayed in case of single amino acid comparisons. The logZ ratios are
capped between 73 and 3. The maximum and the minimum blosum62 scores
are 74 and 11. Since the blosum62 matrix is diagonally symmetric, the abso-
lute value of the log ratios are mapped to this range and a p-value is indicated
based on how close the two scores are

3 Results

In this article we demonstrate the graphs generated by i—PV for BRCA1,
CALR and TUBA1A. BRCA1 (NM_007294, NP_009225) is a DNA
repairing protein that plays role in type I breast cancer (Venkitaraman,
2011). In Supplementary Figure S1b, the outermost track shows re—
ported SNVs from dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/). Users
can click on the automatically generated links to the dbSNP website to
have more information about these SNVs. To have an overview of the
distribution of SNVs and Indels, users can refer to the innermost track.

CALR is a protein (NM_004343, NP_004334), which is
mutated in myeloproliferative neoplasms (Trifa et (11., 2015).
Supplementary Figure S1a shows a partial screen shot of CALR with
the minimum and maximum range of conservation scores dynamic—
ally adjusted and plotted so that even when alignments from closely
related species are used, small differences in conservation scores can
be observed. Supplementary Figure S1a shows the functionally im—
portant C—terminal region of CALR.

TUBA1A is a protein (NM_006009.3, NP_006000.2) that, if
mutated, can lead to type I lissencephaly (Romaniello et (11., 2014).
Supplementary Figure S2 shows a partial screen shot of TUBA1A
and the highly conserved GTP binding region amongst the species.
This region is enriched in glycine, serine and threonine residues (se—
quence track, colored letters) with few surrounding amino acids
with aromatic side chains (green hexagons).

It is often necessary to know the distributions of different amino
acids along a protein of interest. For instance, you may want to see distri—
bution of specific amino acid(s) against some other set of user defined
amino acid(s). Moreover, users can choose to display the amino acid in—
formation with window sizes varying from 10 to 100 residues. All data
points belonging to these windows are highlighted with values upon
mouse over events. In addition to amino acid distributions, in case of sin—
gle amino acid comparisons, a blosum62 agreement graph is also shown

telling the user if the current distribution is in agreement with the matrix
score of that amino acid pair (Wei et (11., 1997). Supplementary Figure
S3 illustrates such example taken from TUBA1A.

I—PV also comes with tools to extract sequence, conservation, spe—
cific features (user selected amino acids with different properties) and
SNVs between user defined regions in a formatted text layout with user
defined number of items per line. Feature extraction is done simply by
clicking on the conservation track and selecting the extract option.

4 Discussion

Many sequence visualization tools focus on certain aspects of proteins
such as conservation, variations, sequence alignments or topology.
For instance I—COMS (Iserte et (11., 2015) focus on multiple sequence
alignments and recruits links with 3 outer tracks. Likewise, Circoletto
(Darzentas, 2010) parses blast results and visualizes sequence similar—
ity with interactivity at the level of web server. Another software
package, ggbio (Yin et (11., 2012) implements circular visualization for
genomics and high throughput data using R programming language.
Following a different approach, RCircos (Zhang et (11., 2013) directly
integrates Circos into R for 2D plots. Although more ﬂexible than i—
PV, both tools are limited in providing user interaction. While all
aforementioned tools are very useful in their own right, we pursued a
more interactivity based design. Therefore, i—PV is not solely designed
for visualization but also for live presentable graphs and information
that can selectively be displayed and customized. I—PV combines
major sources of information under one html file that is easy to gener—
ate and share on both desktop and mobile environments. Some visual—
ization tools come with mouse over or on—click explanations;
however, since they are based on image files, there are limited user—
driven changes that can be performed on the image. Due to the same
reason, images from many sequence visualization tools are limited in
diversity whereas in i—PV, the user can entirely customize the image
since she/he is in charge of the input files, even after output gener—
ation. I—PV does not use an image map like most conventional visual—
ization tools; rather it links data to scalable vector graphics (svg)
elements which makes sequence and feature extraction possible with
a few mouse clicks. The software packages that are used in the mak—
ing of i—PV, have their own active community such as CIRCOS and
D3 (Bostock et (11., 2011) which also makes i—PV a live framework
where new features can be added. Last but not least, many visualiza—
tion tools are based on rectangular—scroll based representation of in—
formation which does not deliver a ‘wide angle’ view of the sequence
data unlike circular visualization. However, as like all other types of
visualizations, there are also limitations for circular graphs when it
comes to conveniently zoom in to a particular region or visually align
tracks with different radii. We intend to further develop this software
with several other features based on end user needs. The current ver—
sion of i—PV can be downloaded from http://www.i—pv.org.

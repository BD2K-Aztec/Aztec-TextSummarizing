ﬁnd Alu and L1 insertions in each individual (Table 1). This trio
was previously part of a survey of Alu and L1 elements in a 1000
Genomes pilot project follow—up study (Stewart et al., 2011); how—
ever, the sequencing data available at the time provided lower
Illumina sequencing coverage for each genome (946x), which
hindered the sensitivity of Alu and L1 detection (Chip Stewart,
personal communication). For Alu elements, the sensitivity of
RetroSeq and Tangram is >97% for all three individuals, with
Tea slightly lower (see Table 1). For L1 elements, the sensitivity of
all the methods is uniformly lower, with RetroSeq and Tangram
performing best. However, when we look at the RetroSeq false
negative rates by TE type in the trio, we do not see a significant
difference in the rates for L1 (6.3%) over Alu (6.8%) calls.

We can estimate an upper false discovery rate in the child by
examining the calls relative to the expected inheritance patterns.
If we consider the calls private to the child as false positives, the
false discovery rate of the callers varies significantly
(Supplementary Table S1), with RetroSeq having the lowest
overall rate (7.7%), followed by Tangram (12.1%) and Tea
(14.3%). If we take the calls shared by the parents and not
found in the offspring, we can estimate the upper false negative
rate for RetroSeq in the offspring at 6.7%. We can use the
PCR—validated calls with precise break points to examine
the accuracy of the break points estimated by RetroSeq.
Supplementary Figs S27S4 show the distribution of the break
points found by RetroSeq around the PCR—validated break
points. In NA12878, the vast majority (92%) of the break
points are within :I:50 bp of the PCR break points, with 40%
being within 10 bp (Supplementary Fig. S4).

The coverage for these samples is extremely high (>75><), so it
is useful to ask what is the effect on the sensitivity of TE calling
when the sequencing depth is lower. Therefore, we sub—sampled
the data from sample NA12878 at various depths and plotted the
sensitivity relative to (i) the PCR—validated calls and (ii) the inter—
section of the computational calls from Stewart et al., 2011 and
RetroSeq. Supplementary Fig. S5 shows that there is a significant
drop off in sensitivity at depths lower than 20x, with the sensi—
tivity of the computational calls >90% at 40x coverage. Thus, in
the context of TE calling in low coverage populations, data from
multiple individuals could be pooled to increase the sensitivity of
TE discovery.

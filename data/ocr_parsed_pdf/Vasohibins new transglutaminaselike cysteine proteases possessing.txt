Abstract

Summary: Vasohibin—1 and Vasohibin—2 regulate angiogenesis, tumour growth and metastasis.
Their molecular functions, however, were previously unknown, in large part owing to their per—
ceived lack of homology to proteins of known structure and function. To identify their functional
amino acids and domains, their molecular activity and their evolutionary history, we undertook an
in—depth analysis of Vasohibin sequences. We find that Vasohibin proteins are previously un—
detected members of the transglutaminase—Iike cysteine protease superfamily, and all possess a
non—canonical Cys—His—Ser catalytic triad. We further propose a calcium—dependent activation
mechanism for Vasohibin proteins. These findings can now be used to design constructs for pro—
tein structure determination and to develop enzyme inhibitors as angiogenic regulators to treat me—

tastasis and tumour growth.

1 Introduction

Tight regulation of angiogenesis contributes to normal physiology,
growth and development, but when misregulated leads to, or dra—
matically affects, pathological conditions, such as ischaemia, wound
healing and cancer (Ferrara and Kerbel, 2005). Angiogenesis is a
fundamental step in transitioning tumours from benignancy to ma—
lignancy. The use of angiogenesis inhibitors in treating cancer has
thus received considerable attention over the last four decades
(Bergers and Benjamin, 2003).

Vasohibin—1 (VASH1) was initially identified as a vascular endo—
thelial growth factor inducible gene that regulates endothelial cell mi—
gration (Watanabe et (11., 2004; Sato, 2013; Sato, 2015). Despite
lacking a classical secretion signal, human VASH1 protein is released
extracellularly, assisted by a small vasohibin—binding protein which is
the only known VASH1—interacting protein (Suzuki et (11., 2010).
Over—expression of a paralogue, Vasohibin—2 (VASH2), is associated

transformation, and metastasis (Kim et (11., 2015; Kitahara et (11.,
2014; Koyanagi et (11., 2013; Shibuya et (11., 2006; Takahashi et (11.,
2012; Tu et (11., 2014; Xue et (11., 2013). Knockout mouse studies have
revealed the contrasting roles of the two paralogues (Ito et (11., 2013).
VASH1 is expressed in endothelial cells in zones within which angio—
genesis is arrested, whilst VASH2 is expressed in infiltrating mononu—
clear cells at the sprouting front in which angiogenesis is enhanced
(Kimura et (11., 2009). The molecular activity of neither paralogue is
known, in large part due to a perceived lack of homology to proteins
of known structure and function.

2 Results and discussion

2.1 Computational protein sequence analysis

We initiated our analyses by performing a JackHMMER iterative
search (Finn et (11., 2015) starting from the human VASH1 protein
sequence, against the UniRef50 database (Wu et (11., 2006). With the

exception of fungi, the vasohibin family is widely distributed in eu—
karyotes: in animals it is represented from humans to placozoans
(Trichoplax adhaerens), but is absent from nematodes
(Caenorhahditis elegans) and hexapods (Drosophila melanogaster),
and in plants homologues are present from green algae to
Bryophytes (Physcomitrella patens) but are not in vascular plants.
We identified an evolutionarily conserved central region in the vaso—
hibin family, thereby reproducing this unusual phyletic distribution
reported in Pfam (Family: vasohibin/PF14822) (Punta et al., 2012).
Vasohibin homologous sequences were identified in standard data—
bases (UniProt, GenBank and Joint Genome Institute data) and in
manually assembled ESTs and FGENESH+—predicted gene models
(Solovyev et al., 2006).

Next, we took advantage of HMMer3 and HMMer2 (Eddy,
1996; Finn et al., 2015) to search UniRef50 for more divergent vaso—
hibin homologues using a hidden Markov model (HMM) generated
from the central conserved region (corresponding to human VASH1,
UniProt: VASH1_HUMAN, amino acids 125—247). With this pro—
file, HMMer3 identified significant (E—value : 0.011) sequence sim—
ilarities between the vasohibin HMM and a cryptophyte algae
protein from Guillardia theta (UniProt: L11QR7_GUITH, amino
acids 120—227). This G. theta protein is a member of an experimen—
tally uncharacterised family (henceforth, the ‘vasohibin—like’ family)
drawn from phylogenetically heterogeneous organisms. These in—
clude Acidobacteria (Solihacter usitatus and Acidobacteriaceae hac-
terium), Proteobacteria (Bdellovihrio exovorus and Reyranella
massiliensis), and eukaryotes (G. theta, Chaetosphaeridium gloho-
sum, Chlorokyhus atmophyticus and the dinoﬂagellate Karlodinium
veneficum; Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figure S1).

Profile—versus—sequence (HMMer2 and HMMer3) (Eddy, 1996;
Finn et al., 2015) and profile—versus—profile (HHpred) (Soding et al.,
2005) similarity searches using an HMM representing the central con—
served portion of the vasohibin—like family produced concordant results,
identifying robust statistical significance (HMMer2 E—value : 0.03 and
HMMer3 E—value : 1.2 X 1075) for the sequence similarity between
vasohibin and vasohibin—like families (Supplementary Figure S2).

Unexpectedly, HHpred searches against the PDB70 profile data—
base (Soding et al., 2005), again using the conserved central region
of the vasohibin—like family, matched the transglutaminase—like cyst—
eine protease domain of Cytophaga hutchinsonii protein (PDB—ID:
3ISR) with a highly significant E—value of 6.5 X 10’4 (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Figure S2). Moreover, in support of this first match,
the next most statistically significant matches were to five further
members of the transglutaminase—like cysteine protease superfamily
[PDB—IDS: 3KD4, 4FGQ (LapG), 2F4M, ZBSZ (NAT1) and 4DMO
(NAT3)]. Many members of this superfamily are functionally and
structurally characterized enzymes classified in different protein
databases, such as: Pfam (Clan Peptidase_CA CL0125, containing
60 families), SCOP (Fold: Cysteine proteinases, subdivided in 22
families) and MEROPS database of peptidases (clan CA, carefully
subdivided in 36 families) (Andreeva et al., 2004; Punta et al., 2012;
Rawlings et al., 2014).

Additionally, secondary structure predictions of the vasohibin
and vasohibin—like families corroborated this proposed homology
because they yielded high similarity with known transglutaminase—
like cysteine protease superfamily structures (Fig. 1).

2.2 Active site conservation, a non—canonical

catalytic triad

Proteins of the transglutaminase—like cysteine protease superfamily
catalyse various reactions (such as: transglutaminases, proteases,

phytochelatin synthases and arylamine N—acetyltransferases) on di—
verse substrates. Nevertheless, they all contain a conserved catalytic
triad (usually Cys—His—Asp/Glu) (Chatterjee et al. 2012; Ginalski
et al., 2004; Keillor et al., 2014; Makarova et al., 1999, 2000;
Polgar and Asbéth, 1986; Vivares et al., 2005). These amino acids
are conserved as Cys—His—Ser/T hr in human VASH1 and all its
homologues at sites that structurally superimpose onto the transglu—
taminase active centre residues (Fig. 1). This modified catalytic triad
(Cys—His—Ser/T hr) thus appears to be essential for the normal func—
tion of the vasohibin family.

Active sites and catalytic mechanisms of transglutaminase—like
cysteine proteases have been extensively studied (Keillor et al.,
2014; Polgar and Asbéth, 1986). In the classical Cys—His—Asn/Asp
catalytic triad, the Cys, activated as a thiolate anion by the His resi—
due, plays the major role in the nucleophilic attack the substrate.
Both positions, His and Cys, are completely conserved across all
members of the vasohibin family (VASH1 residues C169 and H204)
(Fig. 1).

The third position of the catalytic triad (commonly Asn, Asp or
Glu) is known to have a secondary role in catalysis by orienting the
His side chain to allow the formation of a thiolate/imidazolium ion
pair between Cys and His residues (Vernet et al., 1995). Such a role,
we suggest, could also be performed by the hydroxyl groups of the
conserved Ser or Thr amino acids (VASH1 residue 5221) (Fig. 1).
This non—canonical catalytic triad (Cys—His—Ser/T hr) present in the
Vasohibin family, is not unique to the transglutaminase—like cysteine
protease superfamily, because members of the Transglut_core family
(Pfam entry: PF01841) (Punta et al., 2012), part of the transglutami—
nase—like cysteine protease superfamily, also contain a Cys—His—Thr
non—canonical catalytic triad (e.g. AOLIH5_SYNFM from
Syntrophohacter fumaroxidans). Another example of a non—canon—
ical catalytic triad is the Cys—His—(O:C)Trp triad in mSpeB (PDB:
1dki) (Kagawa et al., 2000), where the role of orienting the His resi—
due is taken by the backbone carbonyl group of a Trp amino acid.
Despite containing this unconventional catalytic triad, mSpeB is an
unusually active protease (Honda—Ogawa et al., 2013).

2.3 Activators, inhibitors and regulators in the
Transglutaminase—like cysteine protease superfamily
Owing to the higher concentrations of calcium in the extracellular
space, diverse secreted proteins possess calcium—dependent activa—
tion mechanisms that avoid intracellular activation. Calcium de—
pendent activation is a recurring theme across the transglutaminase—
like cysteine protease superfamily (Boyd et al., 2012; Chatterjee
et al., 2012; Jang et al., 2014). Calcium—binding sites show a wide
range of geometries involving three or four—COOH groups (particu—
larly aspartic and glutamic acids) plus two neutral oxygen donors
(usually backbone atoms) (Wang et al., 2009). A calcium—dependent
activation mechanism in vasohibin homologues is suggested by the
alignment of a conserved amino acid (VASH1—E171) with a known
calcium binding residue in LapG protease (LapG—D139) (Fig. 1)
(Chatterjee et al., 2012). Experimental evidence will be necessary to
confirm these Vasohibin family predicted calcium—binding sites.
Angiogenesis is not a new cellular process for members of the
transglutaminase—like cysteine protease superfamily. Tissue transglu—
taminase (also known as transglutaminase 2), for example, and also
different members of the cysteine cathepsin family of peptidases,
have been frequently implicated in various aspects of vascular mor—
phogenesis (Turk et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). The identification
of the Vasohibin family as members of the transglutaminase—like
cysteine protease superfamily may further clarify the known

Fig. 1. Multiple sequence alignment of representative vasohibin and related families. Multiple sequence alignments for each family were generated with the pro-
gram T-Coffee (Notredame et al., 2000) using default parameters and slightly refined manually. The final superfamin alignment was generated using a combin-
ation of profile-to-profile comparisons (Soding et al., 2005) and sequence alignments derived from structural super-positions for those families whose tertiary
structure is known (PDB IDs: 3isr, 2bsz, 4dmo and 4fgq) (Holm and Sander, 1995). Active site residues are labelled and coloured according to reference protein se-
quences: VASH1, NAT3 (human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 3), and calcium-dependent periplasmic cysteine protease LapG in red, pink and violet, respect-
ively. A putative calcium-binding residue (human VASH1 E171) is labelled. Families are indicated by coloured bars to the left of the alignment: Vasohibin,
Vasohibin-like and transglutaminase-like cysteine protease are indicated in red, yellow and purple, respectively. The limits of the protein sequences included in
the alignment are indicated by flanking residue positions. Secondary structure predictions (Jones, 1999) were performed independently for the vasohibin and
vasohibin-like families (show in ssipredVash and ssipredBac lanes); these are consistent with X-ray determined secondary structures of the putative cysteine
protease from C. hutchinsonii (PDB: 3isr) (Stein et al., Midwest Center for Structural Genomics, unpublished), NAT1 (arylamine N-acetyltransferase-1) from
Mesorhizobium Ioti (PDB: 2bsz) (Holton et al., 2005), NAT3 (arylamine N-acetyltransferase-3) from Bacillus cereus (PDB: 4dmo) (Kubiak et al., 2013) and the cal-
cium-dependent periplasmic cysteine protease LapG from Legionella pneumophila (PDB: 4fgq) (Chatterjee et al., 2012). Alpha-helices and beta-strands are indi-
cated by cylinders and arrows, respectively. The alignment was presented with the program Belvu using a colouring scheme indicating the average BLOSUM62
scores (which are correlated with amino acid conservation) of each alignment column: red (>3), violet (between 3 and 1.5) and light yellow (between 1.5 and 0.5)
(Sonnhammer and Hollich, 2005). Sequences are named according to their UniProt identification or common name (details provided in Supplementary Figure
S1). Below the alignment are shown a homology-model of human VASH1 and known structures of representative members of the transglutaminase-like cysteine
protease superfamily. Catalytic triads are labelled and side chains shown using sticks. The human VASH1 structural model was created using Modeller (Sali and
Blundell, 1993). VASH1 model and structures are presented using Pymol (http://www.pymol.org)

relationship between reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS and
RNS) and angiogenesis (Huang and Zheng, 2006; Ushio—Fukai,
2007; Ushio—Fukai and Urao, 2009). ROS and RNS are known to
inactivate different members of the transglutaminase—like cysteine
protease superfamily, such as papain (Xian et al., 2000), arylamine
N—acetyltransferase (NAT1) (Dupret et al., 2005) and transglutami—
nases (Bernassola et al., 1999; Nurminskaya and Belkin, 2012). We
thus suggest that the putative catalytic cysteine residues in VASH1
and VASH2 could be substrates of ROS and RNS activity.

Owing to the enzymatic diversity of its transglutaminase—like
homologues, our computational analysis is unable to predict the
catalytic reaction or substrate of vasohibins. Nevertheless, the dis—
covery of vasohibins as enzyme homologues should now motivate
the determination of their protein structures and the development of
active site inhibitors that differentiate VASH1 from VASH2. Such
inhibitors would be anticipated to modify angiogenesis and thus to
be useful for inhibiting metastasis and tumour growth. We note that
different inhibitors have already been described for several members

of the transglutaminase—like cysteine protease superfamily (Badarau
et al., 2013; Chakka et al., 2015; Keillor et al., 2015; Kerr et al.,
2009; Kukongviriyapan et al., 2006; Pandey and Dixit, 2012; Sim
et al., 2014; Turk et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 2013).

3 Conclusion

Given the strong statistical significance of sequence and profile com—
parisons, and the concordance of secondary structure predictions
and conserved active site residues, we have shown that vasohibin
proteins are new members of the transglutaminase—like cysteine pro—
tease superfamily, and possess a non—canonical Cys—His—Ser/Thr
catalytic triad. This insight should immediately help guide experi—
ments to clarify the molecular mechanisms by which VASH1 and
VASH2 control angiogenesis.

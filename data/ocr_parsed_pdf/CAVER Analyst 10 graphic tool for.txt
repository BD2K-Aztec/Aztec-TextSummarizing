ABSTRACT

Summary: The transport of ligands, ions or solvent molecules into
proteins with buried binding sites or through the membrane is enabled
by protein tunnels and channels. CAVER Analyst is a software tool for
calculation, analysis and real-time visualization of access tunnels and
channels in static and dynamic protein structures. It provides an intui-
tive graphic user interface for setting up the calculation and interactive
exploration of identified tunnels/channels and their characteristics.
Availability and Implementation: CAVER Analyst is a multi-platform
software written in JAVA. Binaries and documentation are freely avail-
able for non-commercial use at http://www.caver.cz.

1 INTRODUCTION

Binding sites of many proteins are deeply buried in the protein
core and are connected with the surrounding environment by
access tunnels (Prokop et al., 2012). The protein channels are
found in transmembrane proteins and are important for the traf-
ﬁc of small molecules through the membranes. Mutations in
these structures can lead to serious hereditary diseases. Shape,
physicochemical properties and dynamics of tunnels/channels
determine the accessibility of binding sites to ligands, ions or
solvent molecules and their biological activity (Damborsky
et al., 2007; Prokop et al., 2012). Tunnels/channels can be
found in a wide range of proteins, making their analysis import-
ant and useful. Owing to the intrinsic protein dynamics, the
tunnels/channels signiﬁcantly change their shape and proper-
ties over time (Chovancova et al., 2012; Karplus et al., 2002;
Klvana et al., 2009). Interactive calculation and Visualization of
tunnels/channels with their characteristics can facilitate the study

of important biochemical phenomena, as well as the design of
new catalysts or effective drugs (Gora et al., 2013; Koudelakova
et al., 2013; Pavlova et al., 2009; Prokop et al., 2012). To meet
these needs, we have developed the CAVER Analyst (Fig. l),
which complements the recently published command-line
CAVER 3.0 for identiﬁcation of tunnels in static and dynamic
protein structures (Chovancova et al., 2012). Unlike other avail-
able graphic interfaces for tunnel analysis Moleis Waffe et al.,
2008), PoreWalker (Pellegrini-Calace et al., 2009) and
MOLEonline 2.0 (Berka et al., 2012), which are limited to the
tunnel analysis in a single static structure (Brezovsky et al., 2013),
the CAVER Analyst enables comparative analysis of tunnels/
channels in homologous structures and to study their dynamics.

Tunnels/channels calculation: CAVER Analyst integrates
CAVER 3.0 for identiﬁcation of tunnels in static structures
and molecular dynamic trajectories. The calculation can be set
and performed directly using the CAVER Analyst interface. The
most important calculation settings are available through the
Tunnel Computation window (Supplementary Fig. S1), while
the advanced parameters can be set in the Tunnel Advanced
Settings window or loaded from the configuration ﬁle. The start-
ing point for the calculation can be derived from (i) the catalytic
residues automatically loaded from the databases, (ii) automat-
ically identiﬁed cavities, (iii) interactive selections or (iv) manu-
ally speciﬁed atoms, residues or coordinates. The starting point
can be manually adjusted.

Cavity calculation: CAVER Analyst integrates an efﬁcient al-
gorithm for computation and Visualization of molecular surfaces
and cavities. The algorithm is based on the additively weighted
Voronoi diagram and allows users to access a real-time analysis
of cavities in static structures (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Visualization: Protein structures can be Visualized using all
standard Visualization styles and colored according to various
criteria (Supplementary Fig. S3). The Visualization of molecular
surface can be customized by setting the level of the surface re-
finement and transparency. For exploration of the inner protein
structure, CAVER Analyst offers clip planes for cutting off parts
of the molecule. Tunnels and channels can be Visualized by (i)
center lines indicating tunnel location and curvature, (ii) spheres
showing approximate tunnel geometry, omitting asymmetrical

parts of the tunnel and (iii) detailed surface, which presents the
tunnel geometry more accurately, including the asymmetrical
parts (Supplementary Fig. S3). Tunnels/channels identiﬁed
throughout the trajectory can also be Visualized in one snapshot
as their center lines.

Statistics: The summary table lists the statistics of individ-
ual tunnel clusters, including their priority, frequency, aver-
age bottleneck radius, length, curvature and throughput
(Supplementary Fig. S4). By selecting a particular cluster, char-
acteristics of all individual tunnels/channels from a given cluster
are depicted. Furthermore, each individual tunnel/channel can be
explored at the level of its proﬁle, showing changes in its radius
and neighboring residues along its length. Additionally, the
tables listing the tunnel-lining residues and the bottleneck resi-
dues are provided for each tunnel cluster. All tables can be sorted
by user-selected characteristics, and data can be exported as
comma-separated values (CSV) or text ﬁles. All tables are inter-
actively interconnected with the Visualization window, enabling
the interpretation of the results in the context of the 3D protein
structure. The tunnels and residues selected in the tables are
automatically highlighted in the structure and thus can be sim-
ultaneously explored in the tables and Visualization window.

Graphs: Characteristics of individual tunnels/channels can be
plotted in the form of 2D graphs. Users can plot together into
one graph the proﬁles of different tunnels or the proﬁles of the
same tunnel identified in different structures or snapshots, which
significantly facilitate tunnel comparison (Supplementary Fig.
S5). For molecular dynamics, the tunnel/channel profiles can
be animated by switching between individual snapshots.
Besides the proﬁles, this module enables users to display a time
evolution of its characteristics (bottleneck and average radius,
length and curvature) in the form of 2D graphs or heat plots
(Supplementary Fig. S6). All graphs can be saved as images or
exported as raw data.

Other: Besides the features speciﬁc to the tunnel/channel ana-
lysis, the CAVER Analyst provides a number of additional

features: (i) structure alignment by combinatorial extensions
(Shindyalov et al., 1998), (ii) addition of hydrogen atoms,
(iii) changing protonation of titratable residues (Case et al.,
2012), (iv) selections, (V) coloring and labeling, (Vi) managing
of workspaces, etc.

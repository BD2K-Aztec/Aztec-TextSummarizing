ABSTRACT

Motivation: Fluorescent and luminescent reporter gene systems
in combination with automated microplate readers allow real-time
monitoring of gene expression on the population level at high
precision and sampling density. This generates large amounts of data
for the analysis of which computer tools are missing to date.
Results: We have developed WellReader, a MATLAB program for
the analysis of fluorescent and luminescent reporter gene data.
WellReader allows the user to load the output files of microplate
readers, remove outliers, correct for background effects and smooth
and fit the data. Moreover, it computes biologically relevant quantities
from the measured signals, notably promoter activities and protein
concentrations, and compares the resulting expression profiles of
different genes under different conditions.

Availability: WellReader is available under a LGPL licence at
http://prabi1.inrialpes.fr/trac/wellreader.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 BACKGROUND

Experimental techniques based on ﬂuorescent and luminescent
reporter gene systems have become powerful tools for the real-time
monitoring of gene expression in living cells. The reporter systems
are obtained by fusing the promoter region (and possibly part of the
coding region of a gene of interest) to a reporter gene. The expression
of the reporter gene, which generates a light signal (ﬂuorescence or
luminescence) that is easy to measure, thus reﬂects the expression
of the gene of interest [e.g. Zaslaver et al. (2006)].

Thermostated and agitated automated microplate readers allow
emitted ﬂuorescence and luminescence signals to be measured on the
level of populations of microorganisms. They are typically designed
to read a 96-well microplate, where each well contains a cell culture
expressing a reporter gene or a control (cells without reporter
constructs or growth medium only). All wells are successively
read to measure in a single experiment the optical density of the
cell culture, which is approximately proportional to the number
of cells in the population, and the luminescence and ﬂuorescence

intensity. This allows in viva monitoring of the expression of several
dozens of genes in parallel. Several applications in systems biology
and biotechnology have conﬁrmed the interest of monitoring gene
expression by means of this approach [Kobiler et al. (2005); Lu et al.
(2002); Onnis-Hayden et al. (2009); Ronen et al. (2002)].

In order to correctly interpret the reporter gene measurements,
the primary data produced by the microplate reader must be
translated into biologically relevant quantities, such as promoter
activities and (relative) protein concentrations. This requires
background corrections, data smoothing and ﬁtting procedures, and
mathematical transformations of the measured signals. Computer
tools are essential for this, since automated microplate readers
generate huge amounts of data, typically several thousands of
data points per experiment. To our knowledge, no user-friendly
computer tools for analyzing population-level ﬂuorescence and
luminescence reporter gene data exist in the public domain. The
program WellReader aims at ﬁlling up this gap, thus facilitating the
exploitation of the technology for the monitoring of gene expression
in microorganisms.

2 DESCRIPTION OF FUNCTIONS

WellReader is equipped with a graphical user interface, structured
around a visual representation of the microplate. This allows the user
to access and control the analysis ﬁlnctions of the program (Fig. 1):
an outlier detection module, a data smoothing and ﬁtting module,
a background correction module, modules for computing promoter
activities and protein concentrations and a module for comparing
expression proﬁles. In each step of the analysis, intermediate results
can be stored for later use and exported to MATLAB for further
analysis.

Outliers occasionally occur due to instrument or experimental
errors, and they are removed either manually or by a simple
outlier detection algorithm that can be parametrized by the user.
After elimination of outliers, the data are interpolated by means of
cubic smoothing splines with a user-deﬁned smoothing parameter.
Background levels of absorbance, ﬂuorescence and luminescence
systematic may cause systematic errors in the measurements.
WellReader therefore allows the user to deﬁne background wells,
and subtract the background levels from the uncorrected signals
after appropriate normalizations. Relative measures of protein
concentrations and promoter activities are then computed from
the corrected absorbance, ﬂorescence and luminescence data.

Fig. 1. Screenshot of WellReader main window. It shows the microplate and the absorbance data for one of the wells. The analysis functions listed at the

lower right-hand side of the screen can be applied to the selected well.

This involves kinetic models of the temporal expression of reporter
genes, as well as user-deﬁned values for the half-lives of reporter
proteins (e.g. GFP and luciferase) and host proteins. A detailed
description of the data analysis procedures can be found in the
Supplementary Material of this article.

All ﬁmctions operate on the same underlying data structure, thus
allowing the user to switch back and forth between the stages of the
analysis process, and quickly investigate the consequences of, for
example, different choices for smoothing parameters or background
corrections.

3 IMPLEMENTATION AND DOCUMENTATION

WellReader has been implemented in MATLAB using the Spline
toolbox (MathWorks). The program has been tested under Windows
and Linux with different versions of MATLAB (R2007a, R2009a).
In addition to the source code, a stand-alone executable is available
to run WellReader outside the MATLAB environment. WellReader
imports data in the plain text format generated by the Fusion Alpha
microplate reader of Perkin Elmer as well as an XML format. This
allows the user to load data from other plate readers, after a suitable
transformation of the output ﬁles of the latter.

An online user manual is available at the WellReader web
site together with a tutorial and an example dataset, concerning

key global regulators involved in different stress responses of
Escherichia coli. The results of the analysis of the dataset will be
reported elsewhere.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The authors would like to thank Thomas Jouve for his contribution
to a pilot version of the program.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The imperfect sequence data produced by next-
generation sequencing technologies have motivated the development
of a number of short-read error correctors in recent years. The majority
of methods focus on the correction of substitution errors, which are
the dominant error source in data produced by Illumina sequencing
technology. Existing tools either score high in terms of recall or preci-
sion but not consistently high in terms of both measures.

Results: In this article, we present Musket, an efficient multistage
k—mer-based corrector for Illumina short-read data. We use the
k—mer spectrum approach and introduce three correction techniques
in a multistage workflow: two-sided conservative correction, one-
sided aggressive correction and voting-based refinement. Our per-
formance evaluation results, in terms of correction quality and de
novo genome assembly measures, reveal that Musket is consistently
one of the top performing correctors. In addition, Musket is multi-
threaded using a master—slave model and demonstrates superior par-
allel scalability compared with all other evaluated correctors as well as
a highly competitive overall execution time.

1 INTRODUCTION

The emergence and rapid progress of next-generation sequencing
(NGS) technologies has enabled the high-throughput production
of short DNA sequences (reads) at low cost. The ever increasing
throughput and decreasing cost has significantly altered the land-
scape of whole-genome sequencing, providing an opportunity for
scientists to initiate whole- genome sequencing projects for almost
any organism, including those whose genomes span billions of
base pairs, such as the giant panda (Li et al., 2010a) and humans
(Li et al., 2010b). Many NGS sequencing technologies have been
developed, among which Illumina is most widely used. However,
reads produced from NGS platforms are never perfect and can
contain various types of sequencing errors, including substitu-
tions and indels (insertions or deletions). These sequencing
errors complicate data processing for many biological applica-
tions such as de novo genome assembly (Salzberg et al., 2012) and

short-read mapping (Liu et al., 2012; Salmela and Schroder,
2011).

To improve data quality, one frequently used approach is to
trim reads from the more error-prone 3/wnds, which unfortu-
nately results in loss of information Wang et al., 2012). This has
ignited the interest of researchers in conceiving more sophisti-
cated algorithms to detect and correct sequencing errors in NGS
data, for example, Schroder et a]. (2009). As substitution is the
dominant error type for data produced by Illumina sequencing
technology, most approaches focus on correcting this type of
errors Wang et al., 2012). The core of substitution-error-based
methods is to compute consensus bases using the highly redun-
dant coverage information. When a sequencing error occurs in a
read that originated from a certain position on the genome, all
reads covering the erroneous position could be piled up to com-
pute the consensus base. Considering that sequencing errors are
generally random and infrequent, this consensus base is likely to
be correct. However, as we assume that the source genome is
unknown beforehand, we can neither determine the read loca-
tions on the genome nor the correctness of reads directly.
Instead, reads that cover overlapping genomic positions can be
inferred by assuming that they typically share common sub-
strings. Furthermore, we can approximate the source genome
using a k—mer spectrum, which was ﬁrst introduced by Pevzner
et a]. (2001). Given a dataset with sufﬁcient coverage of a
genome, the k—mer spectrum is defined as the set of all k—mers
in the dataset, where the k-mers whose multiplicity exceeds a
coverage cut-oﬂ are deemed to be trusted and otherwise,
untrusted. The first k—mer spectrum-based corrector was pro-
posed by Pevzner et a]. (2001), using an iterative spectral align-
ment problem approach. CUDA-EC (Shi et al., 2010) and
DecGPU (Liu et al., 2011a) accelerated this spectral alignment
problem approach using graphics processing unit computing. To
further improve correcting quality, Chaisson et a]. (2004) intro-
duced a dynamic programming approach that corrects errors by
minimizing edit distances. The SOAP corrector (Li et al., 2010b)
adopted a similar approach. Quake (Kelley et al., 2010) intro-
duced a probabilistic model derived from base quality scores of
reads. For a k—mer, Quake accumulates the correctness probabil-
ity of all its occurrences and deﬁnes this sum as the multiplicity
of the k-mer, instead of just the number of occurrences. Reptile
Wang et al., 2010) relies on a Hamming graph to resolve ambi-
guities for a tile-based correction, whereas Hammer (Medvedev
et al., 2011) combines the Hamming graph with a probabilistic
model to deal with datasets with non-uniform coverage. HiTEC
(Ilie et al., 2011) supports multiple k-mer sizes in a single launch

and relies on witness clusters that are constructed from sufﬁx
arrays. SGA (Simpson and Durbin, 2012) uses a memory-
efﬁcient Burrows Wheeler transform (Burrows and Wheeler,
1994) and an FM-index (Ferragina and Manzini, 2005) to rep-
resent the k—mer spectrum. In addition to k-mer spectrum-based
approaches, some correctors based on other techniques have
been developed. SHREC (Schroder et al., 2009) uses a general-
ized sufﬁx trie to detect and correct substitution errors, which is
further extended by Hybrid SHREC (Salmela, 2010) to addition-
ally correct indels. Coral (Salmela and Schroder, 2011) and
ECHO (Kao et al., 2011) are two correctors that use the concept
of multiple sequence alignment, using k-mers as seeds. Coral
corrects errors by constructing consensus sequences from mul-
tiple alignments, and ECHO by computing consensus bases
using a maximum-a-posterior estimate over position speciﬁc sub-
stitution matrices.

In this article, we present Musket (multistage K-mer spectrum-
based corrector), an efficient substitution-error-based corrector
for Illumina sequence data based on a k-mer spectrum approach
(Pevzner et al., 2001). We introduce three techniques, namely,
two-sided conservative correction, one-sided aggressive correc-
tion and voting-based refinement, to form a multistage correc-
tion workﬂow. The performance of Musket is evaluated using
both simulated and real datasets for short-read data originating
from small-sized (Escherichia coll), medium-sized (human
chromosome 21) and large-sized (human chromosome 1) gen-
omes. In terms of correction quality, Musket is consistently
one of the top performing correctors compared with HiTEC,
SGA, SHREC, Coral, Quake, Reptile and DecGPU. In terms
of de novo genome assembly using the SGA assembler (Simpson
and Durbin, 2012), Musket yields better performance than all
other evaluated correctors with respect to some commonly used
metrics. In addition, Musket provides support for multi-
threading using a masterﬁlave model and demonstrates superior
scalability on a shared-memory multi-CPU workstation, as well
as highly competitive overall execution speed.

2 METHODS

Musket consists of two stages: k-mer spectrum construction and error
correction. For k-mer spectrum construction, Musket counts the number
of occurrences of all non-unique k-mers using a combination of a Bloom
ﬁlter (Bloom, 1970) and a hash table. This k-mer counting approach has
been introduced by Melsted and Pritchard (2011) and has been shown to
be able to signiﬁcantly reduce the memory footprint for large datasets.
Musket automatically estimates the coverage cut-off from the coverage
histogram of all non-unique k-mers. For error correction, Musket intro-
duces three techniques, namely, two-sided conservative correction,
one-sided aggressive correction and voting-based reﬁnement. In addition,
Musket has been parallelized using multi-threading to beneﬁt from the
compute power of common multi-CPU systems.

2.1 K-mer spectrum construction

2.1.1 Parallelized k-mer counting K-mer counting based on a
Bloom ﬁlter generally comprises three steps. Step 1 filters out as many
unique k-mers as possible using a Bloom ﬁlter, storing all non-unique
k-mers in a hash table. Because of the false-positive probability of a
Bloom ﬁlter, some unique k-mers are likely to exist in the hash table.
Step 2 computes the multiplicity of each k-mer in the hash table to de-
termine the unique k-mers that are occasionally stored in the hash table.

and 0 5u<k<v<#slaves). (b) The k-mer coverage histograms of two
datasets with different coverage

Step 3 removes all unique k-mers from the hash table, leaving all
non-unique k-mers in the hash table. We have parallelized this k-mer
counting using multi-threading to leverage the compute power of multiple
CPU cores.

Our parallelization strategy uses the masterislave model, a typical par-
allelization paradigm in which masters are dedicated to task distribution,
and slaves are assigned to work on individual tasks. Typically, there is
only one master in many applications using the masterislave model.
Instead, we have used multiple masters in Musket (Fig. 1a) to avoid
the case in which the task distribution becomes a new bottleneck as the
number of slaves grows larger. In general, the model is conﬁgured to have
more slaves than masters. However, to maximize performance, the
slave-to-master ratio must be carefully chosen. Our experiments indicate
that a 3:1 ratio is good for Musket. In the following, we describe in detail
the tasks that the masters and slaves perform in each step.

In Step 1, the masters fetch reads in parallel from the input ﬁle, where
mutually exclusive accesses to the ﬁle are guaranteed by locks, and then
distribute all k-mers in the reads to the slaves. The distribution of a k-mer
requires the destination slave to be determined deterministically and ef-
ﬁciently from the k-mer itself Thus, we compute the destination slave
from the canonical k-mer, which is deﬁned as the smaller numerical rep-
resentation of the k-mer and its reverse complement. Once the destination
slave is determined, the canonical k-mer is transferred to the slave
through the corresponding communication channels. All slaves listen to
their corresponding communication channels and start processing k-mers
once they arrive. Each slave holds a local Bloom ﬁlter and a local hash
table to capture all non-unique k-mers as well as ﬁlter out as many unique
k-mers. When a k-mer arrives, the slave performs membership lockup in
the local Bloom ﬁlter for the k-mer. If the k-mer is queried to exist in the
Bloom ﬁlter, the slave inserts it into the local hash table because it is likely
to have more than one occurrence and into the Bloom ﬁlter, otherwise.
After completing this step, all non-unique k-mers are deﬁnitely stored in
all local hash tables of all slaves, and the number of unique k-mers oc-
casionally existing in all hash tables depends on the false-positive prob-
ability rate of all local Bloom ﬁlters. Because of the independence of the
local Bloom ﬁlters and hash tables, this step does not require any syn-
chronization between the slave threads, which greatly beneﬁts efﬁciency.

In Step 2, the masters follow the same procedure as in Step 1, whereas
all slaves listen to their corresponding communication channels and wait
for the arrival of k-mers. Once a k-mer arrives, a slave queries the exist-
ence of the k-mer in the local hash table. If present, the multiplicity of the
k-mer is increased by one. After completing this step, each slave holds the
multiplicity of each k-mer stored in its hash table, which is used to de-
termine the uniqueness of a k-mer. In Step 3, the masters are idle, and
each slave deletes all unique k-mers from its hash table. After ﬁnishing
this step, each slave holds a partition of the set of all non-unique k-mers
in the input reads. For Steps 1 and 2, a hybrid combination of Pthreads
and OpenMP parallel programming models is used to implement the
masterislave model. For Step 3, only OpenMP model is used.

2.1.2 Coverage cut-oﬂ estimation K-mer coverage histograms are
frequently used to determine the coverage cut-oﬂ for a k-mer spectrum. A
k-mer coverage histogram illustrates a mixture of two distributions: one
for the coverage of likely correct k-mers and the other for spurious
k-mers. In theory, the coverage of true k-mers follows a Poisson distri-
bution, but the biases in Illumina sequencing add variance (Dohm et al.,
2008). Hence, the coverage of true k-mers can be modelled as a normal
distribution or a mixture of multiple distributions (e.g. Quake models it
by mixing a normal distribution and a Zeta distribution). The coverage of
spurious k-mers can be modelled as a Poisson distribution (Chaisson
et al., 2009) or as a Gamma distribution (Kelley et al., 2010).

Figure 1b shows two k-mer coverage histograms constructed from all
non-unique 21mers in two real datasets, which are generated by randomly
sampling reads from a high-coverage real dataset sequenced from an
E.coli K12 MG1665 sample, which has accession number ERR022075
in the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA), to form a 30x and 70x
coverage of the E.coli genome, respectively. The two curves share similar
trends. As the multiplicity increases, the density (i.e. the number of k-mers
with the same multiplicity) goes down sharply and then climbs up and
down following a bell shape, thus forming a valley at the beginning of
each curve. The area around the valley is generally considered as the
watershed to separate the true k-mers from the spurious ones. The
k-mers distributed at the right of the valley are supposed to be true
k-mers (trusted) and the ones on the opposite side to be spurious
(untrusted). Some correctors have proposed methods to automatically
estimate the coverage cut-oﬂ. HiTEC determines the cut-off by computing
the minimal support that makes the expected number of correct witness
pairs greater than that of incorrect ones for a speciﬁc witness. Quake
calculates it by using the Br0ydeniFletcherﬂoldfarbishanno method
implemented in R to compute the likelihood ratio of trusted k-mers to
untrusted ones for various coverage values. However, the curve of a
k-mer coverage distribution is not always smooth enough, and thus some-
times causes Quake to fail. After examining histograms from some data-
sets, we found that the multiplicity corresponding to the smallest density
around the valley is an appropriate estimation of the cut-off. Hence,
Musket chooses that multiplicity as the coverage cut-off, by default. In
addition, Musket provides a parameter to allow users to specify the

cut-off.

2.2 Error correction

The error correction stage adopts a multistage workﬂow (Fig. 2). The
core of the workﬂow relies on three techniques: two-sided conservative
correction, one-sided aggressive correction and voting-based reﬁnement.

2.2.] Two-sided conservative correction Our two-sided correc-
tion starts with the classiﬁcation of trusted and untrusted bases for a
read. If a base is covered by any trusted k-mer, the base is deemed to
be trusted and untrusted, otherwise. The untrusted bases are considered
as potential sequencing errors (only considering substitutions). The time
complexity of this classiﬁcation procedure is 0(L) for a L-length read,
assuming the querying of a k-mer in the hash table takes constant time.
For a sequencing error occurring at position i of a read of l bases, it
causes up to min{k, i, l—i} erroneous k-mers. In this context, our
two-sided correction conservatively assumes that there is at most one
substitution error in any k-mer of a readian assumption that is relaxed
in later stages of the algorithm. Under this assumption, our two-sided
correction aims to ﬁnd a unique alternative base that makes all k-mers
that cover position i trusted. In this case, we might need to examine up to
k k-mers while correcting a single untrusted base, resulting in high com-
putational overhead. Hence, Musket chooses to only evaluate both the
leftmost and the rightmost k-mers that cover position i on the read, sig-
niﬁcantly improving speed. For a single base, if more than one alternative
is found to make both the leftmost and the rightmost k-mers trusted, the
base will keep unchanged as a result of ambiguity. For a read, the

performed using multiple iterations; (ii) one-sided aggressive correction is
directly followed by voting-based reﬁnement; and (iii) the combination of
one-sided correction and voting-based reﬁnement is conducted in mul-
tiple iterations

two-sided correction will be executed for a ﬁxed number of iterations
(default=2) or until no base change is made. As a constant number of
k-mer membership queries are conducted for an untrusted base, the time
complexity of the overall two-sided correction can be inferred as 0(L).

2.2.2 One-sided aggressive correction When two or more sequen-
cing errors occur in a single k-mer, it is impossible to correct these errors
using the two-sided correction. In this context, we propose a one-sided
correction to aggressively correct errors in the case of more than one error
occurring in a single k-mer. The core idea is as follows. Given a read R,
deﬁne R,- to denote the base at position i of R, and Rik to denote the k-
mer starting at position i. If Rik is trusted, but RH 1k is untrusted, the
base RH k is likely to be a sequencing error. Our one-sided correction
aims to ﬁnd an alternative of Ri+k that yields a trusted RH 1k. Unlike
the two-sided correction, this correction selects the alternative, which
makes the resulting trusted k-mer RH Lk have the largest multiplicity, if
more than one alternative is found.

Our one-sided correction begins with the location of trusted regions for
a read. A trusted region means that every base in this region is trusted,
thus having a minimum length of k. For each trusted region, error cor-
rections are conducted towards each of the two orientations on the read.
For each orientation, the error correction process does not stop until it
either reaches a neighbouring trusted region or fails to correct the current
base. This correction approach is effective but has the drawback that it
strictly relies on the correctness of k-mer Rik. If Riyk does contain sequen-
cing errors but is deemed to be trusted, this one-sided correction is pos-
sible to cause cumulative incorrect corrections, mutating a series of
correct bases to incorrect ones. To reduce this negative effect, we have
introduced two tricks: look-ahead validation and voting-based reﬁne-
ment. The look-ahead validation assesses the trustiness of a predeﬁned
maximal number (default = 2) of neighbouring k-mers that cover the base
position at which a sequencing error likely occurs. If all evaluated k-mers
are trusted for a certain alternative on that position, this alternative is
reserved as one potential correction. The voting-based reﬁnement is used
after completing one-sided correction and will be described in more de-
tails in the following.

In addition, we use a constraint on the number NC (default 54) of
corrections that are allowed in any k-mer of a read. During the correcting
process, we track the number of corrections that have been made in any
k-mer. For a k-mer, once NC exceeds the constraint, all corrections made

in the k-mer will be disregarded. In Musket, the one-sided correction is
conducted for each integer value from 1 to the maximal allowable
number of corrections to conﬁne the number of false-positive errors.
The time complexity can also be inferred as 0(L), same as for the
two-sided correction.

2.2.3 Voting-based refinement The voting-based reﬁnement uses
the same voting algorithm as used in DecGPU with the difference that
Musket only considers the unique alternative base with the highest votes
at a certain position. More details about the voting-algorithm can be
obtained from Liu et a]. (2011). This voting-based reﬁnement is used
because it introduces the fewest new errors, even though it does not cor-
rect as many errors as other correctors (see Section 3). Through our
experiments, this approach does facilitate the reduction of the number
of new errors from the one-sided correction. As the voting algorithm
checks all possible base substitutions in any k-mer, the time complexity
of this approach can be calculated as 0(k>L).

3 RESULTS

We have evaluated the performance of Musket using both simu-
lated and real short-read datasets from the following three per-
spectives: (i) correction quality; (ii) impact on de novo genome
assembly quality; and (iii) speed, parallel scalability and memory
consumption. Performance is compared with several publicly
available correctors: HiTEC (V1.0.2), SGA (V0.9.18), SHREC
(V2.2), Coral (V1.4), Quake (V0.3.1), Reptile (V1.1) and
DecGPU (V1.0.6). For all correctors, we have used the default
settings and disabled read trimming/discarding. For Coral, we
have disabled the correction of indels. As Quake sometimes ex-
ceptionally exits, we have manually run each step of Quake in
this article. All tests are conducted on a workstation with 2
six-core Intel Xeon X5650 2.67 GHz CPUs and 96 GB random
access memory, running Linux (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS).

3.1 Correction quality assessment

Several preVious publications (Ilie et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011a;
Schroder et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010) assessed correction per-
formance based on a binary read classiﬁer that differentiates
correct reads from incorrect ones. We have decided not to use
this metric in our study because it does not reﬂect the ability to
detect and correct indiVidual erroneous bases or the risk of intro-
ducing new errors by wrongly mutating correct bases. Instead,
we have evaluated the performance using a binary base classiﬁer
that takes into account how many erroneous bases are success-
fully corrected as well as how many new base errors are
introduced.

Both simulated and real reads are used for assessment. For
simulated reads, they are simulated from three references of vary-
ing complexity and length: the E.coli K12 M G1665 strain
(NC_000913) of length 4639 675 bases, human chromosome 21
(Chr21) of length 48129895 bases and human chromosome 1
(ChrI) of length 249 250 621 bases. As Quake relies on base qual-
ity scores, we further mimic the real quality scores for the simu-
lated reads by extracting quality scores from related real datasets,
where the quality scores of one read in a real dataset are entirely
used for one read in a simulated dataset. For a simulated dataset
with a uniform base error rate err, we deﬁne Q to denote the
lowest quality score in the simulated dataset, where Q is calcu-
lated from err (deemed to be the probability that a base call is

incorrect) following the PHRED definition (Ewing and Green,
1998). If a real quality score is smaller than Q, we replace the real
one with Q. A11 simulated reads have the same length of 100
bases and contain only substitution errors. For real reads, two
real datasets from E.coli are used (see the Supplementary Data).

Performance is measured in terms of recall, precision, F-score
and Gain. We deﬁne TP (true positive) as the number of erro-
neous bases that are successfully corrected, FP (false positive) as
the number of newly introduced errors (i.e. the number of correct
bases that are changed to be erroneous) and FN (false negative)
as the number of erroneous bases that failed to be successfully
corrected, including the erroneous bases that keep unchanged
and those that are changed to incorrect ones. Recall is calculated
as TP/ (T P + FN), precision as TP/(TP + FP), F—score as 2 x pre-
cision x recall/(precision + recall) and Gain as (TP — FP)/
(TP + FN). The used deﬁnitions of TP, FF and FN are identical
to Yang et a1. (2012). They can also be derived from the four
measures introduced in Liu et al. (2011a): correct corrections
(CC), incorrect corrections (IC), errors unchanged (EU) and
errors introduced (EI), where TP: CC, FF 2 E1 and
FN=IC+EU. A11 recall, precision, F—score and Gain values
in related tables have been multiplied by 100, and all best
values have been highlighted in bold.

3.1.] Evaluation using E.coli genome We have first evalu-
ated all correctors using reads simulated from the small-sized
E.coli genome. Three uniform base error rates (1, 2 and 3) and
three coverage values (30, 70 and 100x) are used. The base qual-
ity scores are extracted from the high-coverage ERR022075 real
dataset (aforementioned).

Supplementary Tables S17S4 show the correction quality for
simulated datasets from the E.coli genome in terms of recall,
precision, F—score and Gain, respectively. In terms of recall,
Reptile is the worst for all 30x- and 70x-coverage datasets,
and DecGPU is the worst for all 100x-coverage datasets.
Among the nine tested datasets, Musket achieves the best per-
formance in four cases, HiTEC is best in four cases and Coral is
best in two cases (there is a tie between Musket and HiTEC for
the 70x-coverage dataset with 2% error rate). In terms of pre-
cision, DecGPU consistently outperforms all other correctors,
and Musket is consistently second best. Coral performs worst
in ﬁve cases, and Reptile performs worst in four cases. This is
because Coral (Reptile) produces significantly more falseiposi-
tive results, for example, up to 87x (32x) more than Musket. In
terms of F-score, Musket is superior to all other correctors for all
datasets except for the 30x-coverage dataset with 3% error rate,
for which HiTEC is better. HiTEC is the second best. Reptile is
the worst for all 30x- and 70x-coverage datasets, and DecGPU
is the worst for all 100x-coverage datasets. Ranking in terms of
Gain is the same as for F-score. On average, Musket has the best
recall, F—score and Gain, whereas DecGPU has the best preci-
sion. In addition, Supplementary Table S6 shows the correction
quality using the two real datasets from E.coli.

3.1.2 Evaluation using human chromosomes Repeat regions
generally occur more frequently in large genomic sequences
than in small ones. While performing correction on a certain
base position, these genomic repeats may result in multiple
choices making error correction more challenging. In this

evaluation, simulated reads are produced from the Chr21 and
Chr] sequences using three uniform base error rates (1, 2 and
3%) and two coverage values (30 and 70%). The base quality
scores are extracted from a real dataset sequenced from a human
indiVidual (SRR189815 in NCBI SRA). In this test, we only
evaluate the performance of Musket, SGA and Quake, excluding
the other four correctors. Both HiTEC and SHREC are not
evaluated because of excessive memory requirements (>96 GB
random access memory), Coral because of too many falseiposi-
tive results and excessive runtime and both Reptile and DecGPU
because of their poor performance in terms of recall, F—score and
Gain for E.coli.

Supplementary Table S5 shows the performance of all evalu-
ated correctors using simulated reads from the medium-sized
Chr21 sequence. In terms of recall, Quake is consistently the
worst. For the datasets with 2 and 3% error rates, Musket
yields the highest performance, and SGA is second. For the
other two datasets, SGA performs best, whereas Musket is
second. In terms of precision, Quake is the best for all datasets,
whereas Musket and SGA show comparable performance. In
terms of F—score, Quake is worst for all datasets. Musket per-
forms best for the datasets with 2 and 3% error rates. SGA is
best for remaining two datasets. Gain has the same ranking with
F—score for each case. For a speciﬁc coverage value, the perform-
ance of both SGA and Quake degrades quickly as the error rate
grows in terms of recall, F—score and Gain, whereas the perform-
ance of Musket only shows small fluctuations. For a specific
error rate, both Musket and Quake show improved performance
as the coverage increases in terms of recall, F-score and Gain.
However, SGA does not always follow this trend. A11 correctors
keep relatively consistent precision for different coverage and
error rates. On average, Musket is superior to SGA and Quake
for recall, F—score and Gain measures, whereas Quake has the
highest precision.

Table 1 shows the performance evaluation using reads simu-
lated form the large-sized Chr] sequence. In terms of recall,
Quake is still worst for all datasets. Musket achieves the best
performance for the 30x-coverage datasets with 1 and 3%
error rates and the 70x-coverage datasets with 2 and 3% error
rates. SGA performs best for the two remaining datasets. In
terms of precision, among the six tested datasets, Musket
yields the highest performance in one case, SGA is best in two
cases and Quake is best in three cases. Ranking in terms of either
F—score or Gain is the same as for recall. For a speciﬁc coverage
value, the performance of Quake degrades as the error rate in-
creases for all datasets and in terms of all measures. The per-
formance of both Musket and SGA varies as the error rate
changes, but does not show any regular trend. For a speciﬁc
error rate, none of the correctors does consistently improve its
performance as the coverage increases. On average, Musket is
superior to both SGA and Quake in terms of all four measures.

3.2 De nova genome assembly

De novo genome assembly has been a difﬁcult and challenging
proposition in genomics. Considerable progress has been made
in just the past few years with the successful establishment of
several de novo assemblers. The most popular approach for
de novo assembly is the use of de Bruijn graphs. Corresponding

assemblers include Velvet (Zerbino and Bimey, 2008),
ALLPATHS (Butler et al., 2008), ABySS (Simpson et al.,
2009), ALLPATHS-LG (Gnerre et al., 2010), SOAPdenovo (Li
et al., 2010b) and PASHA (Liu et al., 2011b). Furthermore, some
recent assemblers, such as SGA (Simpson and Durbin, 2012) and
Fermi (Li, 2012), have used string graphs. To improve assembly
quality, pre-assembly data cleaning has become one of the most
important steps in de novo assembly from NGS reads. Short-read
error correction has been frequently used to improve data quality
and is often the most time-consuming part of the assembly pipe-
line. In addition to many indiVidual correctors, some assemblers
like ALLPATHS-LG, SGA and Fermi have their built-in cor-
rectors. Hence, it is valuable to evaluate the impact of different
correctors on de novo assembly quality.

We have used three real Illumina datasets (Table 2) to assess
the impact on de novo assembly of three correctors: Musket,
SGA and Quake. The E.coli dataset has a coverage of ~30,
produced by randomly sampling reads from the real
ERR022075 dataset aforementioned. The Caenorhabditis elegans
dataset (SRR065390 in NCBI SRA) has a coverage of ~67, and
the Chr14 dataset has a coverage of ~34, given in Salzberg et a1.
(2012). The SGA assembler is used to perform genome assembly
for all tests. For the SGA assembler, the same set of parameters
has been used for each case, where we set the minimal read
overlap length to 50 and used default settings for all other par-
ameters. As the SGA assembler requires every base being known,

we have randomly converted all unknown bases in each dataset
into known ones.

The assembly quality is measured in terms of the following
metrics: N50 contig size, error-corrected N50 contig size,
number of contig errors and genome coverage. The calculation
of N50 contig size starts from sorting all assembled contigs in the
descendent order of length and then accumulates the lengths
from the largest to the smallest until the summed lengths are
not <50% of the reference genome size. The N50 contig size is
the size of the smallest contig that stops the length summation.
The number of contig errors is calculated by summing up the
number of misjoins and the number of indel errors of length >5
in all contigs. The genome coverage is calculated from the
error-corrected contigs, reflecting the number of bases covered
by correct contigs in the reference sequence. The GAGE scripts
from Salzberg et a1. (2012) are used to analyse the resulting
assemblies before and after error correction for each dataset.
In this evaluation, we do not use the paired-end information
and only consider contigs whose lengths are 3200.

Table 3 shows the assembly results. Each corrector is able to
improve both the N50 contig size and the error-corrected N50
contig size for each dataset. In terms of N50 contig size and
error-corrected N50 contig size, Musket is superior to all other
correctors for each dataset. SGA yields greater N50 contig sizes
than Quake for both the E.coli and C .elegans datasets, whereas
the latter performs better for the Chr14 dataset. However, in
terms of error-corrected N50 contig size, except for the E.coli
dataset, Quake outperforms SGA for the other two datasets.
The number of contig errors is identical for all correctors for
the E.coli dataset. However, Musket is superior for the other
two datasets. Furthermore, all correctors are able to reduce the
number of errors for both the C.elegans and Chr14 datasets
compared with when not using error correction. A11 correctors
show improved genome coverage for both the E.coli and Chr14
datasets. Interestingly, the genome coverage decreases after cor-
rection for the C .elegans dataset. This suggests that pre-assembly
error correction is not always favourable with respect to some
measures. In terms of genome coverage, Musket performs best
for both the E.coli and Chr14 datasets and Quake for the
C .elegans dataset. SGA consistently yields the lowest coverage.

3.3 Speed, scalability and memory consumption

In addition to correction quality, execution speed is an important
factor that must be taken into account, especially for large-scale
datasets. We have assessed the speed of different correctors using
both simulated and real datasets. For simulated datasets, we
have organized the datasets into groups as per the genomic se-
quences from which they are generated, and we have averaged
the runtimes of all datasets in each group. For the simulated
datasets from the E.coli genome, all evaluated correctors, with
the exception of both HiTEC and Reptile (which do not support
multi-threading), run two threads because at least two threads
are required for Musket. For the simulated datasets from the
Chr21 and Chr] sequences, and the real datasets, all evaluated
correctors run 12 threads. Runtimes are measured in wall clock
time.

Supplementary Figure S1 shows the average runtimes of all
evaluated correctors for the simulated datasets. For E.coli,
DecGPU is the fastest, and Musket outruns the other correctors.
SHREC, SGA and Coral are slowest. On average, Musket is
about 2.1x faster than HiTEC, 2.5x faster than SGA, 3.3x
faster than SHREC, 3.5x faster than Coral, 1.1x faster than
Quake and 1.7x faster than Reptile. For Chr21 and Chr],
Musket is superior to both SGA and Quake. SGA is slightly
faster than Quake for all simulated Chr21 datasets, whereas
Quake runs slightly faster than SGA for all simulated Chr] data-
sets. On average, Musket runs ~4.6x (4.8x) faster than SGA
and ~5.0x (4.5x) faster than Quake for all simulated datasets
from sequence Chr21 (Chr]).

Figure 3 shows the runtimes of all evaluated correctors for the
three real datasets in Table 2 when using 12 threads. Musket is
superior to both SGA and Quake for all datasets. For the E.coli
dataset, Musket runs ~11.0x faster than SGA and ~46.7x
faster than Quake. For the C.elegans dataset, Musket achieves
a speedup of ~9.3 over SGA and ~18.1 over Quake. Finally, for
the Chr14 dataset, Musket outruns SGA by a factor of ~6.6 and
Quake by a factor of ~17.2. In addition, SGA performs signifi-
cantly better than Quake for each dataset.

In addition to speed, we have evaluated the parallel scalability
of Musket, SGA and Quake in terms of the number of CPU
threads using the real dataset Chr14. Figure 4 illustrates the
speedups using different number of threads. For Musket, the
speedups are calculated against the runtime obtained using
two threads because of the use of the mastereslave model

4 DISCUSSION

We have presented Musket, an efﬁcient substitution-error-based
error corrector for short DNA reads produced by Illumina
sequencing technology. This reference-free error corrector uses
the k—mer spectrum approach and aims at correcting as many
errors as possible while introducing few new errors. Three cor-
rection techniques, including two-sided conservative correction,
one-sided aggressive correction and voting-based reﬁnement,
have been introduced to form a multistage correction workﬂow.

We have assessed the performance of Musket in comparison
with several established error correctors: HiTEC, SGA, SHREC,
Coral, Quake, Reptile and DecGPU. The assessment is con-
ducted using both simulated and real reads in terms of correction
quality and de novo genome assembly measures. In terms of cor-
rection quality, Musket is consistently one of the top performing
correctors for reads simulated from the small-sized E. coli genome
as well as large-sized human chromosomes. The best perform-
ance of Musket is obtained using simulated reads from the
human chromosomes, which suggests that Musket can perform
well on genomic sequences with complex repeat structures. In
terms of de novo genome assembly, Musket is superior to all
other evaluated correctors in terms of the following metrics:
N50 contig size, error-corrected N50 contig size, number of
contig errors and genome coverage. Through this study, we
have found that pre—assembly error correction does not always
guarantee to yield better assembly quality in terms of all metrics,
but have demonstrated the capability of improving contig con-
tiguities and reducing mis-assemblies. Besides de novo genome
assembly, short-read error correctors can also be used before
short-read alignment. As many state-of—the-art short-read
aligners tolerate multiple sequencing errors in the full-read
length, substitution-error—based error correctors might not be
able to make signiﬁcant impact on the improvement of alignment
performance. Hence, the use of Musket might be more valuable
before de novo genome assembly than short-read alignment.

In addition, Musket uses multi-threading, based on a mastere
slave model, to leverage the compute power of common shared-
memory multi-CPU platforms. This approach results in superior
parallel scalability compared with all other evaluated correctors
in terms of the number of CPU threads as well as in overall
execution time.

All existing standalone correctors target haploid genome
sequencing Wang et al., 2012). Kelley et al. (2010) showed that
error correction can benefit single nucleotide polymorphism call-
ing in haploid genomes. However, the effect of error correction
on diploid genomes has not been explored yet. A heterozygous
site results in a percentage of k—mers supporting alternative al-
leles. In a moderate or high coverage dataset, we would expect
these k-mers to be within the distribution of trusted k-mers.
However, this might not be the case when the coverage is low
or allelic distribution is imbalanced. In such cases, diploid single
nucleotide polymorphisms could be lost as a result of false-posi-
tive corrections.

Up to date, almost all correctors based on k—mer spectrum use
a single coverage cut-oﬂ to differentiate trusted k—mers from the
untrusted ones. This static coverage cut-oﬂ ignores the conﬁ-
dence difference in the correctness of bases that is represented
as base quality scores in NGS reads. Hence, a dynamic coverage
cut-oﬂ as in Coral (Salmela and Schréder, 2011) might be ad-
vantageous to further improve correction quality of correctors
based on k—mer spectrums. A possible solution might be the use
of a position speciﬁc cut-oﬂ matrix derived from base quality
scores for a single read.

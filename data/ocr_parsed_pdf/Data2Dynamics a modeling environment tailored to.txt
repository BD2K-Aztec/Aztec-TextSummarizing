Abstract

Summary: Modeling of dynamical systems using ordinary differential equations is a popular
approach in the field of systems biology. Two of the most critical steps in this approach are to
construct dynamical models of biochemical reaction networks for large datasets and complex
experimental conditions and to perform efficient and reliable parameter estimation for model
fitting. We present a modeling environment for MATLAB that pioneers these challenges. The
numerically expensive parts ofthe calculations such as the solving ofthe differential equations and
of the associated sensitivity system are parallelized and automatically compiled into efficient C
code. A variety of parameter estimation algorithms as well as frequentist and Bayesian methods
for uncertainty analysis have been implemented and used on a range of applications that lead to
publications.

Availability and implementation: The DataZDynamics modeling environment is MATLAB based,
open source and freely available at http://www.data2dynamics.org.

For the construction of computational models that are used to ana-
lyze signal transduction pathways, gene regulation and cellular deci-
sions, datasets generated under a wide range of experimental
conditions have to be analyzed comprehensively. The
DataZDynamics software environment is designed for computation-
ally efficient and user-friendly integration of complex experimental

data into models consisting of coupled non-linear ordinary differen-
tial equations (ODE).

Our software allows to specify the right hand side of the ODE
manually or to automatically generate it by providing the reaction
scheme with the respective rate law such as Mass Action, Michaelis—
Menten or a custom rate equation. The resulting ODE system as

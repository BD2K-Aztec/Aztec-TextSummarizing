ABSTRACT

Summary: GECA is a fast, user-friendly and freely-available tool for
representing gene exon/intron organization and highlighting changes
in gene structure among members of a gene family. It relies on
protein alignment, completed with the identification of common
introns in the corresponding genes using CIWOG. GECA produces
a main graphical representation showing the resulting aligned set
of gene structures, where exons are to scale. The important and
original feature of GECA is that it combines these gene structures
with a symbolic display highlighting sequence similarity between
subsequent genes. It is worth noting that this combination of gene
structure with the indications of similarities between related genes
allows rapid identification of possible events of gain or loss of introns,
or points to erroneous structural annotations. The output image is
generated in a portable network graphics format which can be used
for scientific publications.

1 INTRODUCTION

The increasing pace of genome sequencing is providing us with a
growing number of sequences, containing a wealth of information
that will fuel studies for years to come. One of the numerous
resulting ﬁelds of investigation is the comparison of annotations
and subsequent genic organizations in eukaryotic genomes. The
amount of structurally annotated protein genes available has incited
the development of web tools such as GSDS (Chuan et (11., 2007),
FancyGene (Rambaldi and Ciccarelli, 2009). The purpose of these
programs is to represent the exon/intron structure of several genes in
a single image in order to perform global gene structure comparison.

However, these resources display the gene structures
independently, rendering gene comparison difﬁcult and leaving
the individual gene structures lacking in information concerning
sequence conservation.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In order to accurately compare gene structures, we came to
the conclusion that the following data is necessary. The position
and level of similarity within a set of sequences is needed to
highlight conserved regions. Once identiﬁed, a special focus to
the conservation degree around introns is essential in order to
determine whether they can be considered as conserved introns
between paralogs/orthologs.

Since, to our best knowledge, no tool currently exists that
combines this information into a single output, we decided to
develop our own tool, GECA. Its strategy relies on a simple
observation: by aligning genes using the position of common introns
shared by related sequences, we align the surrounding exons of the
respective genes. Thus, GECA fully relies on the output of CIWOG
(Wilkerson et al., 2009), a freely available software that detects
common introns (named cintrons) in a set of related protein-coding
genes. In order to provide the protein alignment ﬁle required by
CIWOG, GECA currently launches MAFFT (Katoh et al., 2002)
but any multiple alignment program with a ClustalW—like output is
suitable.

Once the protein sequences are aligned and the common introns
identiﬁed, GECA is able to produce a main graphical representation:
schematic gene structures, anchored by their ﬁrst common intron
position, overlaid with indications highlighting similar content
between pairs of genes.

2 FEATURES
2.1 Input data format

Protein and genomic sequences in FASTA format together with gene
structures in GenBank feature format are required to execute GECA.
A speciﬁc FASTA header is needed and must be identical for all three.
It should be in the form of ‘>AccessionID | sequence name’.

2.2 GECA representation of aligned gene structures

Once the user-supplied data is uploaded, GECA uses PERL’s GD
and GDzzTethzAlign libraries to draw the gene structures. The
intron/exon organizations of subsequent genes are aligned using
their ﬁrst common intron. Exons are to scale, whereas information
concerning actual length of introns, that all share the same size
in this representation, is given by a color code used by CIWOG.
To display the similarities between the sequences, GECA uses the
protein alignment produced by MAFFT. The similarities between
subsequent sequences in the alignment are represented at the level of
amino acids in the translated exons. Two amino acids are linked by a
blue line if they are identical and a purple line indicates conservative

substitutions (default matrix is BLOSUM62 but BLOSUM45 and
80 are also available). Gaps longer than ﬁve amino acids in the
alignments are displayed in gray. Finally, the exon and intron sizes
are calculated from the genomic coordinates and are displayed under
the exons and introns in black and red, respectively (Fig. I).

Alongside its main and original graphical output, GECA also
simultaneously provides two complementary outputs: (i) a classical,
GSDS-like, gene structure display where exons and introns are
scaled relatively to their length and cintrons are Visible with gene
structures aligned on the ﬁrst common intron and (ii) a tab-delimited
table containing introns’ IDs for each gene as well as lengths and
phases.

2.3 Web-server and standalone package

The idea of developing GECA came from our speciﬁc interest in a
set of large multigenic families, the peroxidases. The evolution of
these families is not yet elucidated and new tools to understand their
evolutionary history was needed. Thus, GECA is available as a tool
from our family database, the PeroxiBase (Koua et al., 2009). The
PERL CGI: :LITE server is accessible in the PeroxiBase environment
(http://peroxibase.toulouse.inra.fr/) as a further analysis after a
BLAST or a multicriteria search.

An independent demo version, accessible from the PeroxiBase
website, provides scientists with a user-friendly interface to
GECA (https ://peroxibase .toulouse .inra.fr/geca_input_demo.php).
From this page, a package providing all PERL scripts for local
installation and execution is available under open source license.
GECA is controlled by a single program, that can be customized
using a conﬁguration ﬁle and requires pre—installation of PERL
(minimum version tested 5.8.8), MAFFT and CIWOG.

Aligning exon/intron structures accompanied with the similarities
between sequences and common introns information is very helpful
while manually checking structural annotation. Moreover, it will
provide major information about gene evolution, such as gain and
loss of introns, and will bring new clues for the intron origin
debate.

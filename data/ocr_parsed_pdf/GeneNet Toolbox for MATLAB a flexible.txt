For two networks [proteiniprotein interaction (PPI); Co—expression (C0)], we timed SR and NP with 50 seed—genes, for 10 000 randomizations (r)/permutations (p), on a
desktop (D) and high—speciﬁcation (HS) computer. D: 3.6—GB RAM and two 3.16—GHz Intel Core2 Duo CPUs. HS: l48—GB RAM and 24 2.67—GHz Intel Xeon CPUs.*Ten

clustering structure. However, DAPPLE has important limita—
tions: its web—based interface forces users to compete with global
users for resources and is a bottleneck in any high—throughput
pipeline; in addition, users are constrained to use DAPPLE’s
built—in PPI. GeneNet Toolbox addresses these problems: it is
standalone, can be run from the command—line, and allows
ﬂexible input. Moreover, it employs a MATLAB—optimized
NP algorithm that preserves both node degree and clustering
structure (see Supplementary Information for a performance
comparison), calculates the same network properties for lists of
seed—genes as DAPPLE, and also enables additional analyses
(described later).

2 FEATURES

Users access GeneNet Toolbox via a graphical user interface, or
by calling command—line functions (see user manual available as
Supplementary Information). The toolbox enables users to assess
seed—gene connectivity in a user—speciﬁed network using either
SR or NP. With SR users can account for gene—attributes.
Two extensions are available for both methods. The ﬁrst restricts
an analysis to a speciﬁed sub—network of the primary biological
network (a ‘background’; see Supplementary Figure S7), thus
enabling the user to assess the connectivity of seed—genes
within a particular genic context, rather than against a ‘whole—
genome’ background. This might be useful, for example, in the
analysis of a behavioural disorder, when a user might want to
compare the connectivity of seed—genes to genes associated with
behaviour, rather than to all genes. The second extension calcu—
lates connectivity from the initial seed—genes to a second set of
interesting genes (a ‘backbone’; see Supplementary Figure S8).
Thus, for example, in analysing the genetic causes of a disease, a
user could assess connectivity of seed—genes to previously identi—
ﬁed candidate—genes for that disease. The extensions can be com—
bined (see Supplementary Figure S9). If available, multiple
processors can be used to reduce run—time. To visualize the
seed—gene direct network users choose the ‘quickview’ option,
or output the network as a tab—delimited text file formatted for
Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011). Input ﬁles are tab—delimited text
ﬁles; results ﬁles are text files.

2.1 Additional features

As noted above, when network ascertainment bias is of concern
(e.g. in a PPI), seed—gene connectivity is likely assessed more

accurately with NP than SR. However, for NP to work it must
be possible to permute a network sufﬁciently while preserving its
clustering structure. To assess a network’s suitability for NP, we
provide a pre—analysis tool ‘Network permutation analyser’ (see
user manual). The tool summarizes a network’s clustering struc—
ture using the global and mean local clustering coefﬁcients, (Luce
and Perry, 1949; Watts and Strogatz, 1998), comparing these
attributes to those obtained for permuted networks. Heuristic
measures indicating the effect of network permutations are also
provided: for N permutations (set by the user) the tool: (i) shows
the mean percentage of edges remaining unbroken per permuta—
tion; and (ii) plots the percent of edges remaining unbroken after
l..N permutations. Finally, we expect that networks in which
hub—genes are connected to hub—genes will be hardest to permute,
so to assess network assortativity we plot the neighbour connect—
ivity distribution (Maslov and Sneppen, 2002).

4 REQUIREMENTS

GeneNet Toolbox requires MATLAB 2013B (at least) and Perl,
and can be used on any computer where these are installed.
Alternatively, the toolbox is available as a set of standalone ap—
plications that can be run without a MATLAB installation or
license, in a Linux environment (Perl is required). The toolbox is
distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (http://
www.gnu.org).

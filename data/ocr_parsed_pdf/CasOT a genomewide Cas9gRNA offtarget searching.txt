ABSTRACT

Summary: The CRISPR/Cas or CasQ/guide RNA system is a newly
developed, easily engineered and highly effective tool for gene target-
ing; it has considerable off-target effects in cultured human cells and in
several organisms. However, the CasQ/guide RNA target site is too
short for existing alignment tools to exhaustively and effectively iden-
tify potential off-target sites. CasOT is a local tool designed to find
potential off-target sites in any given genome or user-provided se-
quence, with user-specified types of protospacer adjacent motif,
and number of mismatches allowed in the seed and non-seed regions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cas9/gRNA (guide RNA), or Cas9/single guide RNA, a custo-
mized type of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeat/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR/Cas) system, has recently
been used for effective gene targeting in many organisms and
cultured cells (Pennisi, 2013; Xiao et al., 2013). This system is
easy to design and engineer; only a single short gRNA, which
contains ~20-nt region reverse complementary to one strand of
the target DNA (the protospacer) with an -NGG motif in 3/-end
(the protospacer adjacent motif, PAM) of the target site, has to
be synthesized for a particular target site. The same Cas9 nucle-
ase can be used universally; this notably reduces the cost of both
time and labor, promoting the broad and rapidly developing
application of this system (Jinek et al., 2012).

However, the speciﬁcity of Cas9/gRNA needs careful evalu-
ation. For example, Cas9/gRNA seems to have considerable off-
target effects in cultured human cells (Cradick et al., 2013; Fu
et al., 2013; Hsu et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013a; Pattanayak et al.,
2013) and in several organisms (Fujii et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013;
Shan et al., 2013). In vitro experiments suggest that the PAM
type could inﬂuence the cleavage activity: the -NGG type of
PAM shows the highest activity, PAM of -NAG comes second
and PAM of -NNGG shows the weakest activity. Mismatches in

different regions of the protospacer in the target site also have
different effects: a mismatch in the region of the ﬁrst l2nt adja-
cent to the PAM (called the seed region) may cause a notable
reduction of the cleavage activity of Cas9/gRNA, whereas mis-
matches in the other region of the protospacer (the non-seed
region) have a much weaker effect (Cong et al., 2013; Jiang
et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013).

An approach to identify potential off-target sites in any given
genome or other sequence is necessary to evaluate the off-target
effects of Cas9/gRNA in vivo. An online tool used for Cas9/
gRNA target design also supports the prediction of certain
potential off-target sites (Hsu et al., 2013); however, neither a
detailed scoring algorithm nor an adjustable option is available
in this tool, and only a few genomes can be searched for target or
off-target sites. Other online tools, TagScan (Iseli et al., 2007) or
Pattern Match (http://Viewer.shigen.info/medakavw/pattern—
match/), are available to search for regions in some commonly
used genomes or only in the medaka genome, with up to two
mismatches. On the other hand, widely used heuristic alignment
tools like BLASTN and BLAT are not designed for exhaustive
searching for short nucleotide sequences (as short as ~20nt).
In addition, the variable types of PAM with random nucleotides
also need to be considered during the search for potential off-
target sites.

Here, we report CasOT, a downloadable and open-source tool
designed to identify potential off-target sites of given Cas9/
gRNA targets or target pairs in any user-speciﬁed sequence or
genome, with several tunable parameters like PAM type and the
mismatch number in the seed (up to 4P6 nt) and non-seed regions
(Supplementary Material 81).

2 IMPLEMENTATION AND FEATURES
2.1 Single-gRNA searching mode

CasOT is a Perl script and can run locally in Windows, *nix and
Mac OS systems. Three searching modes, single-gRNA, paired-
gRNA and target-and-off—target, are provided. In the single-
gRNA mode, users are required to provide (i) an input
FASTA ﬁle including individual 21733-nt target sites (18730-nt
protospacer plus the PAM -NGG in the 3/-end), (ii) genome
sequence ﬁles to search for off-target sites or any user-speciﬁed
sequence and (iii) (optional) a genome annotation ﬁle (Ensembl
GTF format) for determining whether the potential off-target
sites are located in exons. Links to public sequences and

CasOT: a Cass/gRNA off-target searching tool

 

annotation ﬁles for several widely used genomes are available at
the CasOT Web site. Users can specify several parameters for the
search, including the allowed level of PAM type (four levels are
available), and the maximum number of mismatches allowed in
the seed region (076 are available, but allowing 5 or 6 mismatches
needs a large computer random access memory; two by default)
and in the non-seed region (no limit by default).

The program reads the input target sequences and divides
them into PAMs, seed regions and non-seed regions. A pool is
built to contain all possible l2-nt sequences similar to the seed
regions and their reverse complementary sequences, with mis-
matches no more than that allowed by the user-speciﬁed
option. The genome sequences or other user-provided sequences
are scanned nucleotide-by-nucleotide to identify whether any
l2-nt fragment appears in the pre-built seed pool. If found, ad-
jacent genomic sequences of the fragment are extracted and add-
itional test steps are executed to check whether the PAM type
and mismatch number in the non-seed region match the user-
speciﬁed options. If all criteria are met, the position and strand
of the fragment in the genome or sequence are recorded. Then
the detailed information of potential off-target sites, including
locations, sequences, PAM type, numbers and detailed descrip-
tion of mismatches, is output as separate ﬁles corresponding to
each target site. If the annotation file is provided, the gene ID
and gene symbol are output appended to the off-target informa-
tion when this site is located in an exon (Supplementary Material
S4A). A statistic ﬁle to count the types of potential off-target
sites is also output.

2.2 Paired-gRNA searching mode

A new strategy for gene targeting using two gRNAs (paired-
gRNA) instead of a single gRNA was recently reported to
reduce off-target effects; in this system, the Cas9 protein is
mutated from its original nuclease form to a nickase form
(Mali et al., 2013b; Ran et al., 2013). With the guidance of a
single gRNA, the Cas9-nickase only cleaves one strand of the
double-stranded DNA and leaves a single nick, which is precisely
repaired by the cell repair mechanism and does not cause muta-
tions in general. For the purpose of gene targeting, the Cas9-
nickase and a pair of gRNAs are used to generate two nearby
nicks located in opposite strands within a short distance; this can
mediate a double-strand break and subsequent mutagenesis.

In the paired-gRNA searching mode of CasOT, most of the
input and supporting files and the options are similar to the
single-gRNA mode, except that the two target sequences in
each pair in the input FASTA ﬁle must share the same name
with different sufﬁxes ‘_#F’ and ‘_#R’ (Fig. 1A). An additional
option is supported in this mode where users can specify the
maximum distance allowed between the two potential off-
target sequences (100 nt by default). The search results for each
individual gRNA are output similarly to the single-gRNA mode;
and pairs of the potential off-target sites located in opposite
strands of the same chromosome within the allowed offset are
output as another ﬁle (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Material S4B).

2.3 Target-and-off—target searching mode

Sometimes it is necessary to design Cas9/gRNA target sites
and search for potential off-targets of these sites sequentially.

The target-and-off—target mode of CasOT accepts a sequence
<1 kb and searches for candidate target sites first. Two param-
eters for this step can be speciﬁed by users: the allowed length
range of the protospacers of the sites (18730nt; 19720 nt by de-
fault) and the allowed type of sites [only -NGG PAM is required,
or a G in the first position (5/-end) for the T7 promoter is
required as well]. Then the identiﬁed candidate targets are used
to search for potential off-target sites in the given genome or
sequence, similar to the single-gRNA searching mode.

3 CONCLUSION

We present CasOT, the ﬁrst exhaustive tool to accurately identify
potential off-target sites in any user-speciﬁed genome or other
sequence with ﬂexible options in an acceptable period of time
(Supplementary Material S3). Further description of its usage is
available in Supplementary Material S2 and the webpage of this
tool.

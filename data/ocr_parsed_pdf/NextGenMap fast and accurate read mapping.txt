NextGenMap

 

genome and S4 (100 bp reads) from the Drosophila melanogaster genome.
In all datasets, we introduced a 1.2% sequencing error and assumed a
genomic polymorphism (SNPs, insertion and deletions) of 0.1% (S 1, $2)
and 2% (S3, S4). Finally, we simulated 11 datasets (A0, ...,A10) based
on the A.thaliana genome with an increasing degree of genomic poly-
morphisms ((P10%).

Based on the article by Nielsen et al. (2011), we compared
NextGenMap with four popular mapping methods. Representatives of
BWT-based methods were BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009), its extension
for longer reads BWA-SW (Li and Durbin, 2010) and Bowtie2
(Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). As hash-based representative we selected
Stampy (Lunter and Goodson, 2011). Similar to Fonseca et al. (2012), we
executed all programs using default parameters. For further details, see
Supplementary Sections 2 and 3.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In terms of runtimes, NextGenMap outperformed all analyzed
mappers (see Supplementary Table 85a and 86a) on all real
(R1, ..., R5) and simulated datasets (51, ...,S4). NextGen
Map’s CPU implementation was 1.1723 times faster than
Bowtie2, the fastest method so far. The GPU implementation
further reduces the runtime (1.M.9 times faster). If we compare
the runtimes of the methods that showed the highest accuracy,
NexGenMap is between 2.9 and 5.8 times faster than BWA—SW.
Stampy, although very accurate for highly polymorphic genomes
(2.0%), shows the longest runtimes (maximum 37h) compared
with NextGenMap (65 min for the same dataset).

Supplementary Table S6b displays the mapping accuracies for
the simulated data. For low genomic polymorphism (0.1%),
BWA—SW shows 0.1% and 0.2% more correctly mapped reads
compared with NextGenMap for 51 and 52, respectively.
However, for genomic polymorphism of 2%, the hash—based
mappers (NextGenMap, Stampy) are the best with a mapping
accuracy of 97.6% and 85.5% for S3 and S4, respectively.

To further elucidate the influences of polymorphic genomes
on the mapping accuracy, we varied the degree of genomic
polymorphism from 0% to 10% for A.thaliana (A0, ...,A10).
Figure 1a displays the decline in mapping accuracy for BWT—
based methods and also shows that accuracy is unaffected by
degree of genomic polymorphism for the hash—based mappers
(Supplementary Table S7). However, Stampy can only retain
the accuracy with the expense of an increased computing

time (Fig. 1b), whereas NextGenMap shows no substantial
increase in runtime (Supplementary Table S8). In summary,
NextGenMap maps reads very accurately and independent of
the amount of genomic polymorphism (up to 10%). At the
same time, NextGenMap exhibits the fastest runtime. We also
note that graphic cards provide additional speedup. However, a
strong effect is only observed when the number of alignment
computations is high, as is the case for highly polymorphic
genomes (3 8%).

4 CONCLUSION

Here, we showed with real and simulated data that NextGenMap
maps high—throughput sequencing reads accurately and fast at
the same time. This fact was already exploited in studies of
miRNA (Vesely et al., 2012) and bisulﬁte—treated data (Dinh
et al., 2012).

Finally, the automatized estimation of the required number of
alignment score computations per read and the automatic adap—
tation to the hardware result in a reliable and fast read mapper
that requires minimal user interaction. This allows NextGenMap
to reliably map reads even to highly polymorphic genomes
(10%). Thus, it may also be used to map reads from non—
standard organism to a phylogenetically close reference
genome or to apply it to metagenomics data.

Characterization of disordered proteins

 

angle X—ray scattering. Rh can also be obtained from size exclu—
sion chromatography or dynamic light scattering. The expected
observables for each type of data are back—calculated for each
conformer of a large set of input structures within the speciﬁc
module for this data type, in some cases using external programs
ShiftX (Neal et al., 2003), HYDROPRO (Ortega et al., 2011)
and CRYSOL (Svergun et al., 1995).

The algorithm that governs ENSEMBLE is more efﬁcient
when searching for best—ﬁtting structures within a set containing
<5000 conformations. Obtaining a reasonable sampling of the
theoretical conformational space for disordered proteins,
however, is not possible with such a low number of structures.
ENSEMBLE may be used for a variety of protein
conformational states including folded statesialso inherently
dynamic, in which case this pool may be large enough. This
led us to construct a Perl wrapper, which is split into parts
(see Supplementary Material).

Conformer management: A large set of structures, called the
initial soup, is populated by structures provided by the user (e. g.
structures from simulations) and/or regularly replenished with
conformers generated by TraDES (Feldman and Hogue, 2000;
Feldman and Hogue, 2002). We found that at least 100 000 struc—
tures in the initial soup is sufﬁcient for conformational sampling.
The C core of ENSEMBLE acts on a subset of the initial soup
conformations, called the initial pool, containing randomly
selected structures from the initial soup. Each conformer can
be selected multiple times, but the algorithm favors conformers
that have been selected fewer times. The initial pool is prevented
from becoming larger than 5000 conformers by periodic removal
of those that do not contribute to fitting the experimental data.
To increase sampling of conformational space, selected struc—
tures of the currently best fitting ensemble can be slightly rando—
mized with TraDES and added to the initial soup and initial
pool.

The selection process: The C core of ENSEMBLE performs
the selection of an ensemble from all conformers present in the
initial pool. Each module is assigned a weight that determines its
importance in the scoring function. A module ﬁts the experimen—
tal data when its score is lower than a threshold value automat—
ically determined by ENSEMBLE, reﬂecting the back—calculated
data for the selected conformers matching the experimental data.
The module weights are changed and ENSEMBLE is run again
until all modules fit the experimental data. The user can also
incorporate restraints incrementally.

T he final ensemble analysis: Once the selected ensemble ﬁts all
the experimental data, this final ensemble is analyzed.
ENSEMBLE includes a set of scripts for analysis (CaiCa dis—
tances, radius of gyration, secondary structure distribution) and
management of binary structure and data ﬁles generated by the
program. These will be expanded in the future.

The release of this version of ENSEMBLE provides tools that
can be broadly used to enhance the understanding of structural
and dynamic properties of disordered proteins and their correl—
ations with biological function and disease.

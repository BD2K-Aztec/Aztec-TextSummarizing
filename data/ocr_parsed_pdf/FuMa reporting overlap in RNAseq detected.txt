Abstract

Summary: A new generation of tools that identify fusion genes in RNA—seq data is limited in either
sensitivity and or specificity. To allow further downstream analysis and to estimate performance,
predicted fusion genes from different tools have to be compared. However, the transcriptomic con—
text complicates genomic location—based matching. FusionMatcher (FuMa) is a program that re—
ports identical fusion genes based on gene—name annotations. FuMa automatically compares and
summarizes all combinations of two or more datasets in a single run, without additional program—
ming necessary. FuMa uses one gene annotation, avoiding mismatches caused by tool—specific
gene annotations. FuMa matches 10% more fusion genes compared with exact gene matching due
to overlapping genes and accepts intermediate output files that allow a stepwise analysis of corres—
ponding tools.

1 Introduction

A new generation of bioinformatics tools has been released that
aims to detect fusion genes within RNA-seq data; however, the cur-
rent tools are limited in either sensitivity or specificity, making their
results impractical for downstream analysis and subsequent valid-
ation (Carrara et (11., 2013). As shown in other domains of high
throughput sequencing analysis, using a consensus of tools may im-
prove performance by compensating for individual tool error pro-
files (Ewing et (11., 2015; Goode et (11., 2013). Since no single tool
shows superior detection performance, a consensus-based fusion
gene detection in RNA-seq can improve both downstream analysis
as well as overall performance. Moreover, to identify limiting fac-
tors and promote improvement of current algorithms, an accurate
estimation of sensitivity and specificity is required, for which an ac-
curate fusion gene comparison is crucial. Therefore, comparing

validated and in silico predicted fusion genes in an automated fash-
ion and summarizing identical fusion genes in two or more datasets
in an easy and accessible way is a desirable feature.

Ideally, sensitivity/specificity estimation should be based upon
the identified genomic breakpoints provided as two chromosomal
locations. However, the nature of RNA-seq complicates this strat-
egy, as reads may span exon junctions and breakpoints are more
likely to be expected in introns because of their relative large size,
introducing additional uncertainty when trying to pinpoint the exact
genomic position of the DNA breakpoint. For instance, using exact
position-based matching (EPM) results in poor overlap between
tools (Supplementary Section 56). A less conservative strategy used
in DNA-seq analysis involves comparing genomic intervals (Layer
et (11., 2014), which can be defined by adding flanking regions to

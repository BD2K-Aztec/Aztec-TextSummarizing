ABSTRACT

Summary: Computational diagnosis of amino acid variants in the
human exome is the first step in assessing the disruptive impacts of
non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) on human health
and disease. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software
with mutational diagnosis (MEGA-MD) is a suite of tools developed to
forecast the deleteriousness of nsSNVs using multiple methods and to
explore nsSNVs in the context of the variability permitted in the long-
term evolution of the affected position. In its graphical interface for use
on desktops, it enables interactive computational diagnosis and evo-
lutionary exploration of nsSNVs. As a web service, MEGA-MD is suit-
able for diagnosing variants on an exome scale. The MEGA-MD suite
intends to serve the needs for conducting Iow- and high-throughput
analysis of nsSNVs in diverse applications.

Scientists routinely use computational methods to evaluate the
functional disruptiveness of non-synonymous single nucleotide
variants (nsSNVs) because of the lack of high-throughput experi-
mental technology to proﬁle the ever-expanding catalog of vari-
ants of unknown effect (Kumar et al., 2011). A large number of
computational tools and web resources are available that use a
range of methods to diagnose the deleteriousness of nsSNVs
(Mah et al., 2011). However, there is a paucity of software
tools that facilitate both the functional diagnosis and the explor-
ation of the context of its long-term (inter-speciﬁc) evolutionary
history of the mutant positions. This is despite the fact that in-
formation generated from multispecies alignments form the most
powerful measurement of predictive models and is one of the
major factors that determine the prediction accuracy (Hicks
et al., 2011; Kumar et al., 2012).

We have developed the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics
Analysis software with Mutational Diagnosis (MEGA-MD)
suite of resources to address this need. MEGA-MD enables re-
searchers to carry out diagnosis of thousands of nsSNVs efﬁ-
ciently and to explore the evolutionary trajectories of mutant

positions in a user-friendly interface. In its graphical user inter-
face (GUI), MEGA-MD is a client-server application whose
GUI and evolutionary analysis functions are developed by reus-
ing the source code of the MEGA software (Tamura et al., 2013).
MEGA-MD accesses a relational database containing muta-
tional diagnoses resident on our servers that contains precom-
puted diagnoses and associated information for all possible
mutations at all amino acid positions in the human exome. In
the first version, we have included three primary methods
(PolyPhen-2, SIFT and EvoD) (Adzhubei et al., 2010; Kumar
et al., 2012; Ng and Henikoff, 2003). The ﬁrst two are the most
popular methods, and the third signiﬁcantly improves the per-
formance for nsSNVs found at ultra-conserved and at fast-evol-
ving positions (Kumar et al., 2012). The PolyPhen—2 and SIFT

Fig. 2. Example screenshots displaying results. (A) Mutation Explorer with the Predictions tab selected and diagnoses for many variants displayed;
(B) Detail View showing all prediction data for the variant, which is selected on the Prediction Data tab of the Mutation Explorer; (C) Tree Explorer
showing the ancestral states in the 46-species reference tree at the amino acid position (position 76 in the example shown) of the variant being
investigated; and (D) an example of variants speciﬁed in a text ﬁle, which can be analyzed en mass in MEGA-MD for high-throughput analysis

diagnoses were obtained from deSFP (Liu et al., 2013). We
have also included results from a multi-method consensus diag-
nosis because they have been shown to be more reliable. In this
case, we use the evolutionarily balanced versions of PolyPhen—2
and SIFT diagnosis.

At the start, MEGA-MD asks the user if they would like to
interactively specify a protein whose mutations are of interest or
load a text ﬁle (Fig. 2D) containing a list of variants. If choosing
to use the interactive system, the user may enter a gene name, a
RefSeq messenger RNA ID, or a protein ID into the search box
(Fig. 1A) on the Gene Search tab of the Mutation Explorer
window, which results in a table of possibilities to select from.
For the selected protein, MEGA-MD automatically retrieves a
46-species protein sequence alignment that comes from the
UCSC resource (Fujita et al., 2011), which has been cached in
the MD-DB for quick access. This alignment is displayed in a
grid (Sequence Data Explorer, Fig. 1B), which also contains the
Diagnose Variant command on the top toolbar. For the selected
position (e.g. position 76), the user has the option to request
diagnosis for a speciﬁc variant or all possible variants.

After the required information is entered into MEGA-MD
using one of the two methods described earlier in the text, the
system queries the MEGA-MDW (Web version of MEGA-MD)
server to diagnose the variants of interest. The results are dis-
played in a table View (Fig. 2A) on the Predictions tab in the
Mutation Explorer’s ﬁve column categories (mutations,
predictions, impact scores, features and coordinates). This table
has capability for searching, sorting, exporting and customizing
of columns (e.g. resizing and hiding). For the currently high-
lighted row in the Mutation Explorer, a Detail View is available,
which not only presents an easy-to-read View of all available
information for the currently selected variant but also provides
buttons to ‘Explore Alignment’ and ‘Explore Ancestors’ (Fig. 2B).
Clicking on Explore Alignment produces a display similar to
Figure 1B, where the user can View the 46-species alignment
associated with the currently selected variant along with the
option to explore more predictions (all the predictions accumu-
late in the Mutation Explorer).

Clicking the Explore Ancestors button provides the user with
the option to infer ancestral states for the position where the cur-
rent amino acid mutation is found. Users can use the maximum
likelihood or maximum parsimony approaches and select various
analysis options; MEGA-MD automatically uses the 46-species
reference phylogeny along with the amino acid alignment. When
the ancestral states inference computation is complete, the
46-species tree is displayed in the Tree Explorer window
(Fig. 2C). In the example shown, the mutation of interest in
humans is an R—>K change, which is also found on the ancestral
lineage that led to Rhesus and Baboon (marked by red arrow).
For this reason, the EvoD diagnosis deems it to be not disruptive
(i.e. neutral). However, PolyPhen-2 and SIFT predict it to
be deleterious. The three-method consensus result is ‘Likely-
deleterious’ as two of three methods produce a deleterious
result (Liu and Kumar, 2013).

We have also updated the most recent version of the MEGA
software to include the mutational diagnosis functionalities
(Tamura et al., 2013), where it is accessed through the
‘Diagnose’ menu. Also, MEGA-MD can be used as a web ap-
plication through the URL http://www.mypeg.info, which can
process tens of thousands of variants quickly and return a
comma-delimited result file containing all the information
shown in the Mutation Explorer of the GUI version.

In the future, we plan to add results from additional methods
of nsSNV diagnosis and more expansive multispecies sequence
alignments. In the meantime, we hope that the web and user-
interface applications described here will serve the needs of many
researchers in further investigating large-scale and individual
variants.

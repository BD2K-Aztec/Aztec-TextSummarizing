Abstract

Summary: MGEScan—long terminal repeat (LTR) and MGEScan—non—LTR are successfully used pro—
grams for identifying LTRs and non—LTR retrotransposons in eukaryotic genome sequences.
However, these programs are not supported by easy—to—use interfaces nor well suited for data visu—
alization in general data formats. Here, we present MGEScan, a user—friendly system that combines
these two programs with a Galaxy workflow system accelerated with MP1 and Python threading on
compute clusters. MGEScan and Galaxy empower researchers to identify transposable elements in
a graphical user interface with ready—to—use workflows. MGEScan also visualizes the custom anno—
tation tracks for mobile genetic elements in public genome browsers. A maximum speed—up of
3.26>< is attained for execution time using concurrent processing and MP1 on four virtual cores.
MGEScan provides four operational modes: as a command line tool, as a Galaxy Toolshed, on a
Galaxy—based web server, and on a virtual cluster on the Amazon cloud.

1 Introduction

Transposable elements (TEs) move within or between most eukary—
otic genomes and constitute a significant portion of these genomes.
It is known that nearly half of the human genome is derived from
TEs (Lander et (11., 2001). The transposition of TEs generates new
mutations that can have different effect, ranging from changes in
genes expression to genomic instabilities. Therefore, the identifica—
tion and analysis of TEs is important for understanding genome
evolution.

TEs can be classified into retrotransposons and DNA trans—
posons according to their mechanism of transposition (Kidwell and
Lisch, 1997). Whereas DNA transposons cut and insert themselves

into new genomic sites, retrotransposons are copied and inserted at
new genomic locations using RNA intermediates. Retrotransposons
can be classified into two subgroups according to the existence of
long terminal repeats (LTRs) at their 5’ and 3’ ends. In addition,
both LTR retrotransposons and non—LTR retrotransposons can be
further classified into various orders, super—families, and families
based on their structure, encoded genes, and phylogeny (Wicker
et (11., 2007).

We previously developed two separate computational methods
for the genome—wide identification of LTR and non—LTR retrotrans—
posons, called MGEScan—LTR and MGEScan—non—LTR, respect—
ively. MGEScan—LTR identifies all types of LTR retrotransposons,

Galaxy—based system for identifying retrotransposons in genomes

i.e. young intact, old intact and solo LTR retrotransposons, using
approximate string matching, protein domain analysis, and profile
Hidden Markov Models (Rho et (11., 2007, 2010). MGEScan—
nonLTR identifies non—LTR retrotransposons based on Gaussian
Bayes classifiers and generalized hidden Markov models consisting
of 12 super states that correspond to different clades or closely
related clades (Rho and Tang, 2009).

MGEScan—LTR and MGEScan—non—LTR have been successfully
used for identifying retrotransposons (Colbourne et (11., 2011).
However, these programs were not designed to support either a web
graphical user interface or parallel execution on clusters. Their compu—
tational time for eukaryotic genome analysis ranges from a few hours
to several days. In addition, because they were developed as command—
line tools that produce output files regardless of post—processing, it is
not easy to visualize the results or perform further analysis.

In this article, we introduce MGEScan, a Galaxy—based system
for identifying retrotransposons in genomes. MGEScan provides an
integrated interface to run both computational LTR and non—LTR
retrotransposon identification programs using the Galaxy workﬂow.
This design facilitates input data preparation and the further ana—
lysis of results. Execution time for retrotransposon identification in
genomes is reduced by 68% when MGEScan runs with concurrent
and MPI executions. Moreover, because we provide MGEScan in
various forms, users can use MGEScan in their preferred way.

2 System descriptions

In this section, we describe the design objectives of MGEScan: to re—
duce execution time, add versatility, and improve the usability of the
MGEScan—non—LTR and MGEScan—LTR programs as well as to
map these design objectives with system implementations.

First, we integrated the MGEScan—LTR and MGEScan—non—LTR
into MGEScan with a user—friendly interface to facilitate concurrent
execution and provide three options for running either program or
both. Therefore, a user can execute them concurrently or individu—
ally on a local machine or clusters.

Second, we adapted MGEScan to the Galaxy framework to support
powerful and ﬂexible data preparation and further analysis of the results.
A single input data is shared between the programs. The results of the
programs are merged and exported to General Feature Format v.3
(GFF3) for further analyses or visualization by genome browsers (Fig. 1).

Third, to improve the performance (i.e. throughput), we replaced
HMMER version 2.3.2 in MGEScan with version 3.1b1 (Finn et (11.,
2015) and re—trained the profile Hidden Markov Models that are

used to identify retrotransposons in a genome. HMMER 3.1b1 per—
forms better and ensures improved sensitivity because of its new
heuristic acceleration algorithm for sequence searches. In addition
to the concurrent execution of MGEScan—LTR and MGEScan—non—
LTR, if a user runs MGEScan on an MPI—capable machine, the over—
all process execution is faster than non—MPI execution.

Last, we provide four different distribution forms of the MGEScan
program: the command—line program without the Galaxy framework,
the Galaxy Toolshed, the Galaxy—based web server, and the MGEScan
virtual clusters on the Amazon cloud. If a user is looking for a light—
weight and simple program but is not familiar with the Galaxy system,
the MGEScan command—line program can be downloaded and in—
stalled on a local machine without the Galaxy framework. In contrast,
if a user needs to use both the graphical and command—line interfaces
with full features but lacks the necessary skills or understanding of the
MGEScan programs, the Galaxy—based MGEScan webserver or the
MGEScan Galaxy Toolshed can be downloaded and installed.
MGEScan programs are included in the webserver with helper tools to
reduce the effort of using workﬂows and tools. We also provide a one—
liner command to support the quick and simple installation of the
required software and configuration for the command—line program or
the Galaxy—based webserver. Finally, a user may want to run
MGEScan in a cloud environment or in clusters. In this case, the user
can use a virtual machine image of MGEScan with the Galaxy frame—
work. Currently, we provide a virtual image of Galaxy—based
MGEScan on Amazon EC2 (Amazon machine image ID: ami—
10672b7a on the US East region). Thus, a virtual single or multiple ser—
vers for MGEScan can be easily deployed on Amazon Web Services.

3 Results and conclusion

To evaluate the improvement in throughput of MGEScan, we com—
pared the execution time of MGEScan—LTR, MGEScan—non—LTR,
MGEScan without MPI, and MGEScan with MPI using test genome
datasets. The consistency of prediction results across different ver—
sions of MGEScan was also evaluated (see Supplementary
Materials). We described our experiments and results in detail in the
Supplementary Materials.

When MGEScan ran without MPI, the execution time was, on
average, 1.43>< faster than MGEScan—non—LTR and MGEScan—LTR
because of the concurrent execution support and version upgrade of
the HMMER in MGEScan. In addition, MGEScan with MPI (four
vCPUs) was 3.26>< faster than MGEScan—non—LTR and MGEScan—
LTR. Also, the performance comparison of MGEScan over a differ—
ent number of MPI processes shows that the MGEScan programs
for LTR and non—LTR provide better performance with additional
MPI processes. These results show that MGEScan improves the
throughput of retrotransposons identification in genomes while the
prediction performance remains consistent across the different ver—
sions of program and different MPI settings.

In this article, we provide the integrated and improved MGEScan
for identifying retrotransposons in eukaryotic genomes. MGEScan,
with its improved usability, throughput and versatility, can be easily
used to identify all types of retrotransposons. Future work will in—
clude developing a module for identifying DNA transposons in
MGEScan and incorporating newly discovered families of TEs to fully
support the identification of all kinds of TEs in eukaryotic genomes.

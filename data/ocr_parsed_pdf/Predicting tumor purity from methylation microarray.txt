Abstract

Motivation: In cancer genomics research, one important problem is that the solid tissue sample ob—
tained from clinical settings is always a mixture of cancer and normal cells. The sample mixture
brings complication in data analysis and results in biased findings if not correctly accounted for.
Estimating tumor purity is of great interest, and a number of methods have been developed using
gene expression, copy number variation or point mutation data.

Results: We discover that in cancer samples, the distributions of data from Illumina Infinium 450 k
methylation microarray are highly correlated with tumor purities. We develop a simple but effect—
ive method to estimate purities from the microarray data. Analyses of the Cancer Genome Atlas
lung cancer data demonstrate favorable performance of the proposed method.

Availability and implementation: The method is implemented in lnfiniumPurify, which is freely

available at https://bitbucket.org/zhengxiaoqi/infiniumpurify.

1 Introduction

Advances of high—throughput technologies have revolutionized the
cancer genomics research. Tremendous efforts have been made to
study the genomic characteristics of different types of cancers, for ex—
ample by large consortiums like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
Results from these studies contribute significantly to the understanding
of cancer etiologies and the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers and
therapeutic targets. In cancer research, one important problem cannot
be overlooked is that the solid tissue sample obtained from clinical set—
tings is always a mixture of cancer and normal cells. The mixture
brings complication to data analysis and results in biased and even er—
roneous findings if not correctly accounted for (Olshen et (11., 2011).
The problem of estimating ‘tumor purity’, or the proportion of
cancer cells from a mixed tissue, has been of great interests. A num—
ber of statistical methods and software tools were developed over

the last several years, based on data for gene expression (Ahn et (11.,
2013; Clarke et (11., 2010; Yoshihara et (11., 2013) or copy number
variations and point mutations (Bao et (11., 2014; Carter et (11., 2012;
Roth et (11., 2014; Su et (11., 2012). In particular, ABSOLUTE (Carter
et (11., 2012) is a statistical method for inferring tumor purity and ab—
solute copy number from a mixed sample based on SNP array data.
It takes the estimated copy ratios as input and jointly estimates pur—
ity and ploidy by maximizing the whole data likelihood.
ABSOLUTE has been applied to most of the TCGA samples, and its
purity estimates have become the de facto gold standards provided
by TCGA. Nevertheless, many of the existing methods still require
data from purified samples or significant prior biological know—
ledge, which could be difficult to obtain in clinical settings due to
the heterogeneity of cancer. The limitations significantly undermine
the practical usefulness of the existing methods.

In this work, we discover through extensive real data exploration
that DNA methylation data from Illumina Infinium 450k micro—
array are informative for tumor purities. DNA methylation is an im—
portant epigenetic modification of DNA molecule with essential role
in many basic biological processes. It often shows abnormality in
various types of cancers (Irizarry et (11., 2009). An important feature
of DNA methylation is that a majority of the genome are either fully
methylated or unmethylated (Lister et (11., 2009). From a mixed
tumor tissue, genomic regions that are differentially methylated be—
tween cancer and normal will likely show mid—level methylation. So
the distribution of mid—level methylation provides information for
the tumor purity. Although there are several reports on the existence
of intermediately methylated regions (IMR) even from pure sample
(Elliott et (11., 2015; Landau et (11., 2014; Stadler et (11., 2011), our
real data observations show that there are much more IMRs from
mixed samples, so that the tumor purity can still be inferred from
IMRs with carefully designed algorithm.

A recently developed method MethylPurify estimates tumor pur—
ity from bisulfite—sequencing (BS—seq) data (Zheng et (11., 2014). The
method uses the methylation information from single sequence read
and performs estimation through a two—component mixture model
using EM algorithm. An important advantage of the method is that
it does not require data from reference samples, so it has a wider ap—
plication in clinical settings. However, because of the high cost of
BS—seq experiment, application of the method is still rather limited.

In large—scale population level studies, for example the epigenome—
wide association study (epiGWAS), microarray technology such as
Illumina Infinium 450k microarray is still widely applied. In this
work, we seek to understand whether the tumor purity can be esti—
mated from methylation microarray data. We discover that there exist
probes, mostly with intermediate methylation levels, that are inform—
ative for inferring tumor purity. We develop a method to estimate
tumor purity from Illumina Infinium 450 k microarray and then apply
the method on the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) data. Results
show that the method can accurately predict the tumor purity levels.

2 Methods

We first provide a formal justification of the validity of our ap—
proach. Denote the proportion of cancer cells in solid tumor be or.
Because of the differential methylation between cancer and normal
samples, from methylation microarray there will be a number of
probes located in the differentially methylated regions (DMRs).
These probes are referred to as differentially methylated probes
(DMPs) hereafter.

Within DMRs genome—wide, assume the true methylation levels
from the pure cancer/normal cells follow two distinct, unimodal dis—
tributions with mode uk, where k : 0/1 represent hypo— and hyper—
methylation. In other words, we assume that the higher methylation
levels (regardless of its sample of origin) in all DMRs follow a distri—
bution with mode #1, and the lower methylation levels follow a dis—
tribution with mode #0. Then in the mixed sample, since the
difference between no and #1 will reasonably large, beta values ([3)
from DMPs will show mid—level methylation if 06 is not too close to 0
or 1. In addition, they will follow a bimodal distribution with two
modes located at 06110 + (1 — 00m and aim + (1 — capo, respectively.
The locations of two modes, which are functions of or, can then be
used to estimate or. The essence of the proposed method is to identify
DMPs and then use the distribution of their beta values to estimate
tumor purity. We design following estimation procedure. For illus—
tration purpose, we use TCGA LUAD data as an example.

The algorithm is summarized in Supplementary Figure S1. The
first step of the algorithm is to select DMPs. Since according to the
aforementioned model, only data from DMPs provide information
for tumor purity. Including non—DMPs will weaken the signal to
noise ratios. We argue that a CpG site is only informative for tumor
purity estimation when it exhibits stable methylation differences be—
tween pure normal and tumor cells and has relatively large variance
among tumor samples due to different normal cell contaminations.
So we select probes with following two characteristics as DMPs:
(i) they show differential methylations among cancers and normal
and (ii) their beta values have large variance in tumor samples. To
do so, we first conduct a non—parametric Wilcoxon Rank—Sum test
on each probe between the tumor and normal and select probes with
P value less than a pre—defined threshold as candidate DMPs. Next
for all candidate DMPs, we compute their variances of the beta val—
ues from all cancer samples and filter out the ones with very small
variances. This step is necessary because we observe from real data
that there are non—trial number (~20—30%) of candidate DMPs
with very small variances cross cancers. This is perhaps caused by
technical artifacts such as probe effects, since different tumor puri—
ties from cancer should result in relatively large variance for DMPs.
We exclude these probes and use the rest as true DMPs for next step
of the algorithm.

With DMPs available, the beta values from DMPs within a data—
set follow a bimodal distribution and the location of the modes will
be used to estimate purity. To increase the signal to noise ratio in
data, we use the following procedure to convert the bimodal into a
unimodal distribution. We first determine the hypo—/hyper—
methylation status for all selected DMPs through comparing their
mean beta values of DMPs from two groups. DMPs with higher
mean beta values in cancer groups are deemed hyper—methylated in
cancer and vice versa. Next, we transform all beta values for DMPs
according to their methylation status. The beta values for hypo—
methylated probes will be changed to 1 — l)’, and there will be no
change for hyper—methylated probe. We assume that approximately
no + m : 1. This assumption is valid based on real data observation
from both microarray and BS—seq data. Under this assumption, the
transformed beta values for all DMPs will follow a unimodal distri—
bution with mode located at owl + (1 — capo, denote such value as
m5. To estimate m5, we compute the probability density of all trans—
formed DMP beta values using kernel density estimation. The mode
of the distribution is deemed estimate of mg.

The estimated m5 is related but not exactly equal to the
tumor purity. Consider tumor sample 1', we have
m5,- : «#11 + (1 — sumo : ‘uo + (‘ul — pom. Here we implicitly
assume that no and #1 take the same values from all samples,
which is reasonable. Given the size of the genome, it is conceivable
that the modes of methylation level distributions from cancer/nor—
mal within DMRs are very similar from different patients. The
model suggests that there is a linear relationship between m5,- and ac,
and the coefficients depend on no and #1. Instead of making assump—
tions on no and #1, we take a supervised learning approach to esti—
mate oti. To be specific, we obtain the purity estimates from
ABSOLUTE for the LUAD samples, use them as true or,- and then fit
following linear regression model: or,- : be + b1ma' + 6,. The esti—
mated model (regression coefficients) can then be used to convert
mg,- IO 06,".

The method is implemented in software InfiniumPurify, which is
freely available at https://bitbucket.org/zhengxiaoqi/infiniumpurify.
InfiniumPurify provides excellent computational performance.
Processing and estimating the purity of all 466 samples in LUAD
data only takes 24 min on a single PC.

Predicting tumor purity from methylation microarray data

3 Results

We obtain LUAD data from TCGA, which profiled 466 resected
LUADs and 32 matched normal samples using messenger RNA,
microRNA and DNA sequencing integrated with copy number,
methylation and proteomic analyses (Cancer Genome Atlas
Research, 2014). The tumor purity estimates from ABSOLUTE are
readily available for 197 samples.

We first look at the distribution of beta values from tumor tis—
sues and normal controls. Figure 1A and B shows the beta value dis—
tributions for cancer and normal samples, respectively. One can
observe a clear difference between tumor and normal samples in
their global methylation distributions, in particular the number of
intermediate methylated probes. Even though there are non—trivial
numbers of probes with intermediate methylation levels from both
samples, the cancer samples have much more such probes, evidenced
by the bump around the middle methylation levels. Figure 1C com—
pares the percentage of probes with intermediate methylation levels
in all tumor and normal samples. Clearly the percentages of such
probes are much greater for tumor samples. These results validate
our claim that there are more intermediate methylation regions in
cancer samples and demonstrate the possibility to use some probes
from these regions to infer tumor purity.

We next apply the proposed procedure to select DMPs between
tumor and normal samples. We use a rather stringent cutoff (P
value : 1e—19) as threshold to select candidate DMPs because results
show that only a small number of most informative DMPs are
enough to accurately determine the tumor purity. We also tried
other P—value cutoffs and final results from those are shown in
Supplementary Table S1. There are a total of 1257 probes selected
after this step. Variance of methylation levels of these candidate
DMPs in tumor samples are much greater than those in normal sam—
ples in general (Fig. 1D). However, there are still some probes with
small variances, likely caused by artifacts. We only keep probes with

ples. (D) Variances in beta values of candidate DMPs in tumor and normal
samples. (E) Distributions of beta values of DMPs, from a tumor sample

variance greater than 0.005 in tumor samples as the final DMPs.
After this step, a total 957 probes are selected as DMPs (699 hyper—
methylation and 258 hypo—methylation), which accounts for
0.197% of all probes. Figure 1E shows the distribution of untrans—
formed beta values of DMPs from one randomly selected tumor
samples. The beta values are mostly mid—level because there are no
spikes at close to 0 or 1, unlike the distributions shown in Figure 1A
or B. On average, 87.0% of the selected DMPs are from intermedi—
ate methylation regrions (methylation levels between 0.2 and 0.8)
for all tumor samples. This validate our claim that some probes
from intermediate methylation level regions are informative for pur—
ity. Furthermore, the distribution clearly show two modes. The bi—
modal distributions demonstrate our theory the distributions of beta
values from the tumor samples are affected by the sample purity,
which furture validate our approach of using such distributions to
estimate purities.

Next we apply the proposed procedure to estimate purity from
all tumor samples. Figure 2A shows the scatter plot of the estimated
m5 and the purity estimates from ABSOLUTE. The Pearson correl—
ation is very high at 0.831. In spite of the high correlation, one can
see the scales of these estimates are different. This indicates that the
m5 values cannot be directly used as the purity estimates. The rea—
sons for different scales can be complicated, involving the variances
of beta value distribution, microarray measurement errors from dif—
ferent artifacts, or different stages of tumorigenesis in genetics
(ABSOLUTE) or epigenetics (InfiniumPurify). It will be very difficult
to figure out and correct all the artifact. That is the reason why we
design the last step of the algorithm, which is to use a supervised
training approach to convert the m5 values to purity.

We use a 10—fold cross validation to verify the approach. To be
specific, we divide all 466 tumor samples into 10 subsets. Nine of
them are used as training data and then the result is validated in the
10th one. In each training step, the algorithm is applied to obtain
the estimated linear regression coefficients be and bl. We then esti—
mate mc values from the test data and apply the linear model to
transform them into purity levels. Figure 2B shows the results from
cross validation, e.g. the predicted purity levels versus the
ABSOLUTE estimates from the test data. Again, the correlation is
very high at 0.829. These results strongly support our proposed ap—
proach and show that using methylation microarray data for esti—
mating tumor purity provides very accurate results, and the
accuracy is comparable to those from ABSOLUTE.

To evaluate the effect of DMP selection on final results, we try
using different P—value cutoffs for Wilcoxon Rank—Sum test. Results
are shown in Supplementary Table S1. We find that using a looser
cutoff and including many probes DMPs will hurt the final results.

For example using 1e—10 as cutoff chooses close to 45 000 DMPs
and the final purity estimations has a correlation of 0.14 with
ABSOLUTE results. On the other hand, using 1e—20 as cutoff and a
little more than 100 DMPs produces a correlation of 0.80. These
results suggest that it is better to be more conservative on DMPs
selection. Overall, using 1000 or so DMPs gives the best results and
using two to four thousands provide slightly worse but comparable
results.

To test the robustness of our method, we further apply
InfiniumPurify to several other tumor types from TCGA, including
lung squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, breast
cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and glioblastoma
multiforme. Results from these samples are consistent with that
from LUAD data and show strong correlation (over 0.8 on average)
with ABSOLUTE estimates. These further demonstrate that
InfiniumPurify provides consistent results and can serve as an alternate
for ABSOLUTE in estimating tumor purity (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Moreover, regression coefficients (bo and 01) are quite similar across
different cancer types, implying that InfiniumPurify could poten—
tially infer purity of cancer types without ABSOLUTE estimates by
borrowing existing regression coefficients.

We also compare our method with two other exising tumor pur—
ify estimation tools based on copy number variance data, i.e.
AbsCN—seq (Bao et (11., 2014) and THetE2 (Oesper et (11., 2014).
However, the published purity estimates from AbsCN—seq and
THetE2 are rather limited, and we are only about to find a few sam—
ples with both AbsCN—seq/THetE2 estimates and 450K array
(which are necessary for our method): two samples for AbsCN—seq
and four samples for THetE2. The purity estimates for these samples
are provided in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3. In general, results
show that the estimates from InfiniumPurify have strong correl—
ations with both AbsCN—seq and THetE2, further demonstrating
that InfiniumPurify is in good agreement with copy number varia—
tion (CNV)—based methods even though it uses completely different
biological infromation and data type.

4 Conclusion

In this work, we discover that the methylation microarray data from
tumor samples contain important information for tumor purity. In
particular, the shape of the beta values distribution is strongly inﬂu—
enced by the purity. We explained the phenomenon using a statis—
tical model and show that the distributions can be utilized to
estimate tumor purity. In essence, beta values of informative probes
(DMPs) follow a bimodal distribution, and the locations of the
modes are related to the tumor purity. By obtaining the modes of
these beta values, tumor purities can be estimated from a linear
model. We design an algorithm InfiniumPurify for purity estimation
and show that it provides good results from several sets of TCGA
data.

There are several advantages of InfiniumPurify compared with
existing tumor purity estimation methods. First it does not require
data from reference panels, which could be difficult to obtain in clin—
ical settings due to the heterogeneity of cancer. Second, it is very
cost effective compared with base resolution methylation data such
as whole—genome BS—seq. Moreover, since the DNA samples are
much easier to collect compared with mRNA, the purity estimation
based on methylation data will provide a more practical mean in
clinical settings. From large cancer—related epiGWAS studies, the
purity estimation can be obtained as a by—product from the methyla—
tion microarrays. Finally, ABSOLUTE usually provides several

solutions corresponding to local maxima of the likelihood.
Prediction results from InfiniumPurify can help researches make a
final decision.

We use ABSOLUTE estimates as benchmark for model training
and results comparison because of the following reasons. First,
ABSOLUTE is one of the earliest and arguably the most inﬂuential
tools for tumor purity estimations. It is widely used as a gold stand—
ard to evaluate new purity estimation methods, for example
AbsCN—seq and THetE2. Second, it provides tumor purity estimates
for several types of tumors and thousands of samples, which can fa—
cilitate large—scale comparison. Third, InfiniumPurify is designed
and tested using data from TCGA samples, and ABSOLUTE is the
official tumor purity predictor for TCGA consortium. The fact that
InfiniumPurify estimates are highly correlated with ABSOLUTE esti—
mates, albeit using a very different data type and computational
model, further justifies the accuracy of ABSOLUTE estimates
independently.

We compared our results with several CNV—based methods and
show good agreements in purity estimation. However, although
both CNV and methylation contain information for cancer purity,
they do not have to be correlated in the raw data level (Feber et (11.,
2014; Houseman et (11., 2009). Both types of methods use genome—
wide distributions of quantities (CNV or intermediate methylated
probes) to estimate purity, the CNV and methylation could be
completely unrelated at finer scales such as within a few hundred
base pairs.

It is important to note that InfiniumPurify does not take ploidy
information of tumor cells into consideration, which could slightly
bias our prediction. However, since the prediction is based on rela—
tively large number of DMPs across the genome and a majority of
them will not have copy number variation, we expect the aberrant
copy numbers would not significantly change the overall result.

The selection of DMPs plays an important role in the method. In
its current form, InfiniumPurify only works when the number sam—
ples is reasonably large. Fortunately, in TCGA, most important can—
cer types have large sample size. It will be interesting and useful to
explore whether it is possible to combine data from different cancers
and construct ‘universal’ DMPs. Moreover, InfiniumPurify is only
focused on estimating tumor purity. Decoupling signals from mixed
sample to estimate the methylation levels from cancer/normal is our
research plan in the near future.

InfiniumPurify is specifically designed for data from Illumina
Infinium 450k arrays, which is the most widely used platform for
DNA methylation. It is conceivable that the same principle and
methods can be applied to data from other platforms.

In this work, we present a simple but effective method to esti—
mate tumor purity from methylation microarray data. The method
can serve as an alternative for existing methods with similar goals.
Although the method is focused on tumor tissues, it can potentially
be applied to other highly heterogeneous samples such as blood or
brain. Furthermore, it will be very interesting to combine methyla—
tion with other genetic and genomic data such as gene expression
and genetic variants and build a joint model for tumor purity estima—
tion. Such model will have potential to significantly improve the es—
timation accuracy.

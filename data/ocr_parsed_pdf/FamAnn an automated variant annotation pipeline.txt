ABSTRACT

Summary: FamAnn is an automated variant annotation pipeline de-
signed for facilitating target discovery for family-based sequencing
studies. It can apply a different inheritance pattern or a de novo mu-
tations discovery model to each family and select single nucleotide
variants and small insertions and deletions segregating in each
family or shared by multiple families. It also provides a variety of variant
annotations and retains and annotates all transcripts hit by a single
variant. Excel-compatible outputs including all annotated variants seg-
regating in each family or shared by multiple families will be provided
for users to prioritize variants based on their customized thresholds. A
list of genes that harbor the segregating variants will be provided as
well for possible pathway/network analyses. FamAnn uses the de facto
community standard Variant Call Format as the input format and can
be applied to whole exome, genome or targeted resequencing data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have led to a
resurgence of family-based studies for the discovery of genetic
variants, in particular single nucleotide variants and small inser-
tions and deletions, harbored in causal genes that underlie
Mendelian and complex diseases. By sequencing exomes or gen-
omes of selected individuals from families, a handful of disease-
causing or associated genes have been identiﬁed (Bamshad et al.,
2011; Boileau et al., 2012; Sullivan et al., 2012). The number of
families selected in each study can vary from one to several hun-
dreds, and each family or group of families may follow a

different inheritance pattern. Moreover, the sequenced individ-
uals from each family may be present as trios or extended pedi-
grees. As a result, an easy-to-use automated pipeline would be
beneficial for systematically selecting variants segregating in each
family and investigating variants shared across families, as well
as annotating variants to facilitate user’s customized prioritiza-
tion for target discovery. A number of open-source tools (Lyon
and Wang, 2012; Supplementary Table 1) have been developed
for annotating and prioritizing variants, but few of them can
compare multiple families simultaneously to identify variants re-
currently present across families. Most of the current tools do
not provide an easy-to-use output so that users can prioritize
variants or genes based on their customized thresholds.

Here, we present FamAnn, an automated variant annotation
pipeline designed for facilitating disease variants or genes discov-
ery for family-based sequencing studies. The advantages of our
pipeline are severalfold. It selects and annotates variants segre-
gating in each family and shared across families. Families with
different inheritance patterns can be analyzed simultaneously by
indicating the corresponding genetic model in the metadata ﬁle.
A model for de novo mutations discovery is provided as well for
users who are interested in identifying de novo mutations in trio
studies. It is easy-to-use, and one Perl command is sufﬁcient to
generate Excel-compatible outputs that retain all annotated vari-
ants. Users with limited bioinformatics skills can apply various
thresholds, such as allele frequency cutoffs, directly on the output
to prioritize variants. When a variant hits multiple transcripts and
hence may have different types of functional effects, it outputs all
the effects for the same variant to avoid missing critical biological
information. We provide functionalities offered by different bio-
informatics resources, such as ENCODE annotation, frequency
checking in public databases, pathogenicity prediction and con-
servation scores. Finally, FamAnn can be applied to all types of
sequencing data, such as whole-exome sequencing, genome
sequencing or targeted resequencing, and can be used to annotate
and prioritize any variant calls generated in the defacto commu-
nity standard Variant Call Format (VCF) (Danecek et al., 2011).

2 METHODS

FamAnn was developed using Perl and can be used as a standalone ap-
plication on diverse hardware and operating systems where standard Perl

modules are installed. It uses sanff (Cingolani et al., 2012) or Variant
Effect Predictor (VEP) (McLaren et al., 2010)-annotated VCF ﬁles as
inputs where each line corresponds to one genetic variant with annotated
genomic location and coding effect. Multiple genetic models are provided
for selecting variants segregating in each family, such as autosomal dom-
inant and recessive. There is also a model for de novo mutation discovery
for trio studies. In addition, a general model that identiﬁes variants
shared by affected individuals but absent in unaffected individuals is
provided for users who do not want to make any genetic assumption.
FamAnn will generate an Excel-compatible output that lists all variants
shared by multiple families and variants segregated in each family. If the
total number of variants is >1 million, we will split the ﬁle into subsets of
1 million variants so that each subset can be analyzed in Excel. FamAnn
will also generate a list of genes in TEXT format, which includes all the
genes harboring variants shown in the variant output ﬁle. Users can use
this list as an input for possible pathway or network analyses, such as
input for Ingenuity Pathways Analysis.

In the variant output file, a variety of annotations are provided for
each variant. For example, loss-of-function mutation annotation is pro-
vided based on sanff function annotation prediction. Compound het-
erozygous mutations in the affected individuals are identiﬁed in the trio
studies. To identify variants in regulatory regions such as enhancers or
promoters, FamAnn retrieves ENCODE annotations by using histone
modiﬁcation tracks obtained from University of California, Santa Cruz
Table Browser, such as mono- and tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 4
(H3K4mel, H3K4me3) and acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27
(H3K27ac). In addition to histone modiﬁcation annotation, FamAnn
also marks variants that fall in the predicted enhancers by using the
DNaseI hypersensitivity track (DNase clusters). To facilitate prioritizing
variants based on their allele frequencies in public databases, FamAnn
extracts variant frequencies from the 1000 Genomes Project (http://www.
1000genomes.org/) and Exome Variant Server (http://evs.gs.washington.
edu/EVS/). To predict whether a variant is in a duplicated region deﬁned
by the Segmental Duplication track obtained in the University of
California, Santa Cruz Table Browser, FamAnn marks it as ‘yes’ in the
‘Segmental_dups’ column in the output ﬁle if the variant is present in a
duplicated region. To predict protein disruption and conservation,
FamAnn uses the deSFP database (Liu et al., 2011) to aggregate
scores of SIFT (Kumar et al., 2009), PolyPhen-2 (Adzhubei et al.,
2010), LRT (Chun and Fay, 2009), MutationTaster (Schwarz et al.,
2010), GERP++ (Cooper et al., 2010), PhyloP (Cooper et al., 2005)
and SiPhy (Garber et al., 2009) in the common output ﬁle. Therefore,
users may prioritize their variants in Excel using the variant output ﬁle
and customized ﬁltering procedures, such as the recurrent frequency of
the variant present in multiple families, the cutoff of allele frequency in
the 1000 Genomes project or mutation type of each variant.

To facilitate the use of our pipeline, all the input datasets and the
annotation tracks will be stored in one directory. To run FamAnn in
the same directory, users need to generate a metadata ﬁle in TEXT
format to include the family IDs and sequenced individual IDs and
their affected status and the model they want to apply to each family.
The detailed framework can be found in Figure 1, and a manual of our
pipeline can be found in the section ‘FamAnn Manual’ in the
Supplementary Information.

3 RESULTS

To evaluate the performance of FamAnn, we tested it on both
real exome-sequenced family datasets (Boileau et al., 2012) and
synthetic whole-genome-sequenced family datasets. Consistent
results between the expected and observed outcomes demon-
strate the accuracy of our pipeline. The details of these tests

4 CONCLUSION

In summary, FamAnn offers a combination of unique advan-
tages in variant annotation to facilitate target discovery for
family-based sequencing studies. It can be applied to variant
discovery for Mendelian or complex disease studies in which
whole exome or genome or targeted resequencing is performed.

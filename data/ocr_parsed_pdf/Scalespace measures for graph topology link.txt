ABSTRACT

Motivation: The network architecture of physical protein interactions
is an important determinant for the molecular functions that are carried
out within each cell. To study this relation, the network architecture
can be characterized by graph topological characteristics such as
shortest paths and network hubs. These characteristics have an im-
portant shortcoming: they do not take into account that interactions
occur across different scales. This is important because some cellular
functions may involve a single direct protein interaction (small scale),
whereas others require more and/or indirect interactions, such as
protein complexes (medium scale) and interactions between large
modules of proteins (large scale).

Results: In this work, we derive generalized scale-aware versions of
known graph topological measures based on diffusion kernels. We
apply these to characterize the topology of networks across all
scales simultaneously, generating a so-called graph topological
scale-space. The comprehensive physical interaction network in
yeast is used to show that scale-space based measures consistently
give superior performance when distinguishing protein functional cate-
gories and three major types of functional interactions—genetic inter-
action, co-expression and perturbation interactions. Moreover, we
demonstrate that graph topological scale spaces capture biologically
meaningful features that provide new insights into the link between
function and protein network architecture.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding the living cell as a system of interconnected com-
ponents is one of the key challenges of the post-genomic era
(Kitano, 2002; Westerhoff and Palsson, 2004). To address this,
many high-throughput screening techniques are used that chart
the physical protein interaction network (PIN) of the living cell
(e.g. Krogan et al., 2006; Ptacek et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2009).
Yeast, for instance, has one of the most comprehensive experi-
mentally verified physical PINs (Stark et al., 2011). The inter-
actions captured in these PINs entail the full range of chemical
bonds between cellular components, ranging from protein

complex formation and kinase signaling activity to transcription
factor binding and DNA modiﬁcations.

Physical interactions give rise to functional interactions. These
can be broadly categorized into (i) serial function interactions,
such as the (causal) effects of a gene perturbation on downstream
transcription, i.e. regulatory network interactions (Hughes et al.,
2000), (ii) parallel function interactions, such as those arising
from synthetic lethality (a genetic interaction; Costanzo et al.,
2010; Phillips, 2008) and (iii) collaborative function interactions,
such as co-expression in protein complexes.

Although some functional interactions are the result of a single
physical interaction, most functional interactions arise as a result
of a complex interplay between a collection of physical inter-
actions. Consequently, analysis of the network architecture is
important for understanding the functionality that it orchestrates
(Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004; Fuxman Bass et al., 2013). For this
purpose, several graph topological measures have been pro-
posed. These topological characterizations have, for instance,
been used to uncover homology relations between proteins
(Patro and Kingsford, 2012) or make predictions on protein
function (Milenkovia: and Przulj, 2008). Moreover, it has been
demonstrated that deletion of hub proteinsiie. proteins with
high network degreeiis more often lethal than deletion of non-
hub proteins (He and Zhang, 2006). This observation was
explained by the observation that essential genes cluster in
hub-enriched essential modules (Zotenko et al., 2008).
Similarly, bottleneck proteinsiie. proteins with high network
betweennessiwere found to be more essential and evolutionary
conserved (Joy et al., 2005) and exhibit different expression
dynamics than proteins with low betweenness H u et al., 2007).

Common graph topological measures, such as shortest-path
length, Jaccard index, clustering coefﬁcient and centrality meas-
ures, only capture topology in the direct Vicinity of the node
under investigation. They thus operate at a ﬁxed ‘zoom level’,
i.e. they do not take topological scale into account. This also
holds for measures that characterize the centrality of a node
with respect to the whole network. These include closeness
centrality, betweenness centrality (Freeman, 1977), subgraph
centrality (Estrada and Rodriguez-Velazquez, 2005), katz cen-
trality (Katz, 1953) and eigenvector centrality (Bonacich, 1972).

The concept of topological scale is, however, important for
studying how functional interaction emerges from the structure
of the physical PIN (Fig. 1A). For instance, at the smallest scale,
links in the PIN may directly implicate a functional relation be-
tween two proteins. At a medium scale, one could find functional
relations that are characterized by a number of physical inter-
actions, such as a small signaling cascade. In terms of graph

Fig. 1. (A) Schematic depection of a physical PIN in which topology dictates functional interactions. (B) Flowchart of data integration steps and
application of the STMs. (C) Intuitive explanation of the shortest-path STM. For ,8 —> 0, the STM behaves similar to the standard shortest-path
measure. For higher values of ,8, it will start to take into account the number of shortest paths (bundle of paths) that connect x and y. Moreover, when ,8
increases, paths that are longer than just the shortest path are considered. In this way, the overall network connectivity between two nodes is
characterized. For ,8 —>00, the measure will approach the logarithm of the number of nodes in the graph component containing x and y. (D) The
Jaccard measure, which normally determines the fraction of common neighbors of two nodes, will take into account more extended neighborhoods with
increasing scale. (E) Similar to the Jaccard, the centrality and clustering coefﬁcient do not just take into account their direct neighbors but with increasing
scale also the neighbors of neighbors. (F) The betweenness centrality measure (measuring the number of shortest path going through a speciﬁc node) is
expanded so that it, with increasing scale, also takes into account longer paths. That is, although node 2 has a betweenness value of zero using the
standard measure, the STM version still captures its role in linking x and y throughout a non-shortest path

topology, this could be captured by a small, linearly connected,
graph structure. Finally, at larger scales, the network topology
that describes complete protein complexes and pathways is im-
portant and should be captured to relate proteins functionally at
a module level. The topology that describes this scale may consist
of several densely connected subgraphs.

Because network topology occurs across a range of scales,
traditional topological measures are inadequate to capture func-
tional relations in the network. Instead, measures that include
some kind of zoom parameter on topological scale are required.
Measures that characterize ‘meso—scale’ topology have been pro-
posed before (Jordan and Scheuring, 2002; Winterbach et al.,
2013b). Of particular interest is the scale-aware version of the
subgraph centrality, proposed by Estrada, that resulted in super-
ior ability to identify essential proteins (Estrada, 2010). However,
the method used to incorporate scale does not extend to other
topological measures and, moreover, was discrete in nature.

Here, we address this issue by introducing a scale-invariant
description of the topology around or between proteins. These
scale-aware topological measures (STMs) are built on the

framework of diffusion kernels (Kondor and Lafferty, 2002),
which can be seen as a network smoothing operation by means
of diffusion. The level of smoothing determines the scale and can
be tuned using a scale parameter. Application of kernel diffusion
to a physical interaction network for a range of scales yields a
graph topological scale-space. In spirit, such a scale-space is simi-
lar to image scale spaces used in computer Vision applications.
There, smoothing is used to obtain a family of derived images
that describe the relevant image structure across all scales.

We derive a range of STMs that can be applied to this graph
topological scale-space. STMs can be deﬁned to characterize a
single protein, such as the degree centrality STM, as well as to
characterize the network connecting two proteins, such as the
shortest-path STM. As our main focus is on functional inter-
actions, we additionally derive link descriptors from the node-
based STMs.

In the remainder of this article, we explore the use of STMs
when applied to the comprehensive physical PIN of
Saccharomyces Cerevisiae (yeast). Using supervised learning to
predict three classes of functional interactions, i.e. genetic

interactions, perturbation interactions and co—expression inter-
actions, we find that non-linear classiﬁers trained on STM fea-
tures can reach area under the receiver-operating characteristic
(ROC) curve (AUC) performances as high as 85%. Moreover,
we demonstrate that clustering based on STM features reveals a
pronounced substructure within each of the functional inter-
action classes that exhibit clearly distinct characteristics with bio-
logically meaningful interpretations.

2 APPROACH

2.1 Constructing the physical PIN

Physical proteiniprotein (PP) interactions are obtained from
BioGrid (Stark et al., 2006) and Phosphogrid (Stark et al.,
2010) and collected in graph GPP with adjacency matrix APP,
ProteiniDNA (PD) interactions are obtained from
YEASTRACT (Teixeira et al., 2006) and collected in graph
GPD with adjacency matrix APD, All interactions reported in
each of these databases were included. Both APP and APD were
made symmetric, thereby transforming directed interactions into
undirected interactions. The resulting adjacency matrices contain
60 770 and 46 857 unique interactions (excluding self-inter-
actions), respectively. To obtain the physical PIN, both graphs
are combined in a linear fashion: AgIN = or * ApD + (1 — a) * App,
where or is the mixing parameter.

2.2 Obtaining functional interactions

We derive three classes of functional interactions: co-expression,
perturbation and genetic interactions. Throughout the text,
these will be represented by symmetric binary adjacency matrices
Am, 1413‘ and Agen, respectively.

Co—expression interactions are calculated from the
MegaYeast expression dataset (Gasch, 2012), which contains
501 yeast microarray experiments measuring expression during
stress responses, sporulation and different cell cycle phases. A co-
expression interaction between two proteins is counted if their
encoding genes are among the top 100 000 correlating gene pairs
(Pearson’s p>0.67).

Perturbation interactions are obtained from four datasets
(Chua et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2007; Hughes et al., 2000; van
Wageningen et al., 2010). A perturbation interaction is counted
if one of their encoding genes exhibits a signiﬁcant differential
expression upon perturbation (knockout or overexpression) of
the other. Differential expression is based on a P—Value threshold
of 0.01 as determined by the respective authors. A total of 80 654
perturbation-effect pairs are obtained, covering 622 perturbed
genes. For the genes that were perturbed in different datasets,
the resulting interactions are combined.

Finally, we obtained all genetic interactions reported by
BioGrid (Stark et al., 2006), totaling 120 580 interactions.

2.3 STMs and topological scale spaces

A wide range of graph topological measures exists (Fuxman Bass
et al., 2013; Winterbach et al., 2013b). Here we focused on the
following six measures: shortest-path length, Jaccard index,
degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality
and clustering coefﬁcient.

STMs are based on diffusion kernels (Kondor and Lafferty,
2002). The diffusion kernel function kﬁ(A) = e’gm’degw», with
deg(A) the degree matrix of A, applied to the adjacency matrix
AgIN will result in the kernel matrix

Krﬁ=kﬁ<AaN> (1)

The formulation of diffusion kernels ensures that K” = (Ka’ﬁ)T
and K0"0 = 1.

One element in  gives the diffusion strength between node
x and y and is a measure of their connectivity. Graph diffusion
can be seen as network smoothing, as for increasing levels of
diffusion )3, the edge weights in the graph become more and
more similar. Note that, in the continuous limit of a regular
grid-based graph, taking the diffusion kernel corresponds to con-
volution with a Gaussian kernel (Kondor and Lafferty, 2002).
Gaussian convolution is also used to construct scale spaces on
images (Witkin, 1984). Importantly, for graphs, this smoothing
process is dependent on the local topology and, moreover, can be
used to describe it.

To construct a graph topological scale-space, we vary )3 across
a range of values, which can be regarded as a scale parameter.
Ka’ﬂ captures the evolution of the edge weights between all nodes
across all scales. Using this representation, we can generalize the
standard topological measures to work across different scale
levels. In Section 5, we give a derivation for each STM, and in
Figure lCiF, we give an intuitive explanation for a few of them.

Some STMs characterize the topology around nodes (the clus-
tering coefﬁcient, centrality and betweenness STM), whereas
other capture interactions within the network (the shortest-
path and Jaccard STM). Node-based STMs can also be used
to characterize network interactions by taking the average or
difference between the scores at two connected nodes. In this
fashion, we arrive at eight STMs for network interactions.
Conversely, interaction-based STMs can also be converted to
node-based STMs by taking the weighted average of the meas-
ures for all connections the node is involved in. Because the
clustering coefﬁcient is already deﬁned as the weighted average
of the Jaccard measure (see Section 5), this results in four unique
STMs for nodes.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Supervised analysis

We evaluate the efﬁcacy of the proposed STMs in a supervised
setting, allowing us to compare them with the standard topo-
logical measures. To this end, we used the random neural net-
work classiﬁer (RNNC), combined with forward feature
selection to determine the optimal set of features. A double-
loop cross-validation was used to prevent selection bias and over-
training. Classiﬁer performance was based on the AUC. More
details can be found in Section 5.

3.1.] STMS capture network structure useful for determining
protein function To determine if STMs capture useful network
structure that can contribute to the task of protein function
prediction, we classiﬁed proteins to speciﬁc functional categories
from the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences
GVIIPS) catalog aVIewes et al., 2004). Figure 2A reports the

It is apparent that STMs increase performance signiﬁcantly.
This is surprising, as others (Winterbach et al., 2013a) have
noted that the ﬁne details captured by more complex topo-
logical descriptors [e.g. graphlets Milenkovia: and Przulj (2008)
and graph spectra Patro and Kingsford (2012)] do not signiﬁ-
cantly contribute to predictive performance, and that competi-
tive performances could be obtained using simple topological
measures.

Note that the poor performance obtained with a classiﬁer
trained on the diffusion kernel directly (middle bar) illustrates
that the diffusion step alone is insufﬁcient to capture the import-
ant topological structure in the network. Apparently, it is the
combination of diffusion combined with a topological descrip-
tion that is important.

We reason that the observed performance gain is obtained
because STMs incorporate information on the meso-scale top-
ology, instead of adding additional ﬁne-grained descriptions of
the local topology. As a result, they describe how the local top-
ology is embedded in the overall network. The improved classi-
ﬁcation suggests that this higher-level description of the network
topology contains useful information for the task of protein
function prediction.

3.1.2 Three classes of functional interaction can be distinguished
using physical network topology Three main classes of func-
tional interactions (co-expression, perturbation and genetic inter-
actions) have extensive measurement coverage in yeast. We
evaluated if these functional (positive) interactions could be dis-
tinguished from an equal number of randomly selected (negative)
gene pairs for which there is no evidence of functional inter-
action. For all three datasets, we derived the previously described
set of eight interaction-based STMs and used the RNNC com-
bined with forward feature selection to discriminate them from
the negative interactions.

The classiﬁcation performances are summarized in the first
three groups of four bars in Figure 2B. These results show that
the three classes of functional interactions are accurately cap-
tured by the topological descriptions of the physical PIN, with

a marked performance improvement for the STMs. This con-
firms earlier results that show that co-expression is linked to
protein co-membership (Jansen et al., 2002) and that genetic
interactions are linked to between-pathway and within-pathway
PP interaction signatures (Kelley and Ideker, 2005). Moreover, it
corroborates the observation that perturbation effects are infor-
mative in predicting the activation and inhibiting characteristics
of PP and PD interactions (Ourfali et al., 2007).

The last three groups of four bars in Figure 2B depict the
results when the classiﬁer was used to discriminate between a
combination of two functional classes. We found that the classes
could be distinguished with surprisingly good performance, in
the order of 0.9 AUC. This suggests that the interaction classes
have different realizations in the underlying physical topology,
and that the topological characteristics are accurately captured
by the STMs. This may also explain why different classes of
functional interactions have little overlap (Fig. 1B). For instance,
the 80654 perturbation and 100 000 co-expression interactions
have only 390 interactions in common, which is just slightly
more than one would expect by chance (375). Moreover, co-
expression and perturbation interactions, which have a larger
overlap, were easier to distinguish than genetic interactions and
perturbation interactions.

Combining STMs with standard measures, results in only
minor increase in performance for both protein function predic-
tion (0.0082 on average) and functional interaction prediction
(0.0021 on average). At the same time, performance is severely
reduced if a simple linear classiﬁer, the nearest mean classiﬁer, is
used. This indicates that STMs are able to capture most of the
relevant network structure that can also be obtained with stand-
ard measures but need an advanced classiﬁer to do so.

The learning curves and classiﬁcation performance for the in-
dividual STMs are included in Supplementary Figure Sl. The
learning curve shows that the classiﬁer requires more than a
single topological descriptor to attain the best performance. On
average, 23 topological descriptors were required, ranging across
different STMs as well as different or and )3 levels, to attain max-
imum performance. Close-to-optimal performance was already
reached using ﬁve topological descriptors. Combining STMs

Fig. 3. (A—F) Top topological descriptors for each classiﬁcation task, based on forward feature selection performed on ﬁve non-overlapping datasets.
Large pie parts with intense colors represent the more relevant descriptors. Pie parts are assigned to classes based on the sign of their rank correlation
with the class labels. Descriptors were grouped into a low- (,B<0.2), mid- or a high- (,B> 1) scale group, as well as a PP (or = 0), PD (or = 1) or PD/PP
mixture group. Standard (non-STM) topological features were also available to the feature selection and are represented without a ,8 value. More in
detail, the size of each pie part indicates the number of times a certain group of descriptors is represented in the top ﬁve descriptors, times their average
rank value (where rank 1 corresponds to the value 1.0 and rank 5 to the value 0.2). Color indicates the STM type, while the intensity represents (again)

the average rank value

outperforms the single STMs, indicating that the STMs augment
each other, albeit to a small extent. Apparently, STMs can sub-
stitute each other to some degree. This may be a sign that ﬁne
details in the topology, of which different STMs capture different
aspects, are not as important as the larger-scale topological struc-
ture, which is captured by every STM.

3.1.3 Topological signatures of functional interactions To deter-
mine which descriptors are the most important for each classiﬁ-
cation task, we performed feature selection. The robustness of
the selected features was investigated by dividing the datasets in
ﬁve non-overlapping subsets, and performing feature selection in
each of them, ensuring ﬁve completely independent feature se-
lections. Surprisingly, despite this, the ﬁrst topological descriptor
(a combination of STM type and or and )3 values) chosen in the
selection was always the same for all but the genetic versus per-
turbation interaction task (where three of the five chosen descrip-
tors were the same). Moreover, the second chosen descriptor was
consistent in almost all cases except for some variation in or and
)3. This remarkably robust feature selection is a sign that each
functional interaction class has its own unique topological
signature.

A Visual overview of the selected features, and thus the topo-
logical signatures, is given in Figure 3. Some of the signatures
have interesting interpretations. In Supplementary Figure S2, the
single descriptor (univariate) AUC performances are given.

For co-expression interactions, the first two selected measures
are always the Jaccard and clustering coefﬁcient STMs. The
Jaccard measure is also selected at the medium scale further
down the ranked list of selected descriptors, as well as for the
classiﬁcation experiments where co-expression interactions are
contrasted to genetic and perturbation interactions (Fig. 3D
and E). An explanation for this is that the Jaccard describes to
what extent two proteins have the same position with respect to
the surrounding topology. From Supplementary Figure S2, it
can be seen that co-expression interactions are best predicted
by low-scale STMs and depend only weakly on the mixture
level of the PP/PD networks.

Genetic interactions are best characterized by the shortest-
path and clustering coefﬁcient STMs. Both results in Figure 3
and Supplementary Figure S2 show a preference for somewhat
higher scales and a strong preference for PP interactions. The
shortest-path measure is associated with the negative class, indi-
cating that genetic interactions are represented by relatively short
paths. The chosen scale is just below the threshold of the low )3
class with )3 = 0.18 (for all five independent repeats).

The second descriptor selected for genetic interactions (clus-
tering coefﬁcient STM) corroborates this picture. It is an indica-
tion that proteins with a genetic interaction are generally also
embedded in a well-connected neighborhood. Taken together,
this suggests that proteins that take part in a genetic interaction
are well connected through the PP network, for instance, because
they are part of a common complex, pathway or module but
without necessarily having common regulators (PD interactions).

Finally, for perturbation interactions, we see a large focus on
centrality measures, which are typical for regulators with many
outgoing connections. Note that experimenter bias could play a
role here, as perturbation experiments are typically performed
for genes with a known regulatory role. On the other hand, the
selection of this measure can also indicate that perturbations in
more central proteins will induce more effects throughout the
network and therefore have more perturbation interactions.

3.2 Unsupervised analysis

Next, we asked if the three broadly defined functional interaction
classes each have a single descriptive topological structure in the
physical network, or if multiple distinct topological implementa-
tions of the functional relations still could be present.

To address this question, we ﬁrst mapped all interactions to a
position in 2D space (Fig. 4), such that the differences in the
topological characterization of these interactions were repre-
sented by their mutual distance in this space. The embedding
reveals a clear structuring into distinct subgroups. Interestingly,
interactions from the three interaction classes are not evenly dis-
tributed across the 2D map (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Fig. 4. (A) Representation of the interactions from the three functional interaction classes augmented with 100 000 negative interactions. The STM
representation of each interaction (which constitutes a 960 dimensional space) was reduced using multidimensional scaling (t-SNE) to two dimensions.
The t-SNE is an embedding technique, which aims to capture local structure in the data (Van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008). Interactions were clustered,
and signiﬁcant enrichments (Binomial test, Bonferroni-corrected P<0.01 and a log odds ratio of > 1) are indicated by colors. (C1—C2, G1—G2, P1—P3)
Detailed description of several clusters. The most signiﬁcant cluster within each of the functional classes is shown, augmented with a few contrasting and/
or supporting examples. Feature selection results are determined by contrasting the cluster to a random selection of interactions from other clusters ﬁve
times the size of the cluster, which is repeated ﬁve times. The top three descriptors are visualized in a similar fashion, as shown in Figure 3. Visualizations

of all other signiﬁcant clusters can be found in Supplementary Figures S4eS6

To investigate this further, the data were clustered using a
combination of spectral and hierarchical clustering. In this fash-
ion, the 400000 interactions were grouped into 498 clusters, of
which 88 contained more than 500 interactions. Of these, 34
clusters (covering 40% of interactions) were signiﬁcantly en-
riched (Fig. 4). For nine clusters, more than 75% of interactions
in the cluster were of a single class, with one cluster (C1) con-
taining 2523 interactions from the co-expression class (97%).

Next, feature selection was performed to investigate which
topological descriptors best capture the topological structure of
each cluster. To this end, interactions from each cluster were
contrasted with a randomly selected set of interactions from
the other clusters, five times the size of the cluster itself.

Some differences with the supervised analysis are expected, as
the contrasting set of interactions contains interactions from all
functional classes as well as the negative class in approximately
equal balance. However, the results still reveal that, within each
class of functional interactions, topological characterizations are
shared among many of the enriched clusters (Supplementary
Figures SLS6). For instance, clusters enriched for the co-
expression class are predominantly characterized by the
Jaccard and shortest-path STMs at low scales (Fig. 4C17C2),
whereas clusters from the genetic class commonly have a short-
est-path STM for the PP network and a negatively associated
shortest-path STM (longest path) for the PD network (Fig. 4G17
G2). This indicates that, even though each class consists of inter-
actions from a number of topologically distinct clusters, the
topological characterization of the different types of functional
interactions is still remarkably robust, confirming the picture
painted in the classiﬁcation experiment, as reported in Figure 3.

There are, however, still notable differences between the clus-
ters. Clusters C1 and C2, for instance, differ in such a way that in
Cluster C1, the Jaccard STM operates on the combined network
at medium scale, whereas in Cluster C2, the PP network is se-
lected at low scale. Both clusters contain interactions with a min-
imal shortest-path length of 2, indicating that they are not
embedded in complexes.

For the perturbation interaction class, Clusters P1, P2 and P3
all depend on the shortest-path STM. However, Clusters P1 and
P2 select it as a negative feature, indicating that short paths are
preferred for the positive class. It is likely that these correspond
to direct relations between a transcription factor and their tar-
gets. This is supported by the observation that all interactions in
these clusters are directly connected in the PD network (the aver-
age shortest-path length in the PD network is 1). For Cluster P3,
on the other hand, high shortest paths are favored, combined
with a high centrality (which was also observed in the supervised
analysis). This may correspond to propagation of the perturb-
ation effect from a central regulator through a combination of
interactions at the PP level and transcription factor activity at the
PD level. This is supported by the observation that interactions
in this cluster have an average shortest path of length 2 in the
combined network but are more than three hops apart in the
individual PD and PP networks.

Clusters G1 and G2 from the class of genetic interactions con-
firm our previous observation that these interactions consist of
well-connected proteins in the PP network. This is apparent from
the selection of the shortest-path STM across the PP and PP/PD
networks and supported by the low average shortest-path dis-
tance. Additionally, both clusters also select long-distance paths

Scale-space measures for graph topology

 

across the PD network, indicative of the lack of a common
regulator.

Taken together, this indicates that each of the three functional
interaction classes has a few rather distinct implementations of
the interactions in the physical interaction network.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

We have shown that generalized STMs can be obtained based on
diffusion kernels. Using these STMs, graph topological scale
spaces can be constructed that characterize graph topology
across the full range of scales, from local to a global scale. The
measures described here already constitute a fairly complete set,
covering centrality, clustering, paths, association and between-
ness. Based on the principles outlined here, however, it should be
straightforward to transform more existing topological measures
into scale-aware versions.

Scale is an important aspect in relating physical networks
to functional annotations and interactions. In a supervised clas-
sification setting, STMs improved performance in all our experi-
mental settings, also in comparison with the equivalent standard
(non-scale-aware) measures. To obtain good classiﬁcation, local
topology is clearly an important factor. However, using STMs,
we also ﬁnd that descriptors of higher scale were selected by the
training algorithms.

We found that the different functional interaction classes each
have their own topological signatures. These signatures are
selected with remarkable robustness. Through unsupervised ana-
lysis, we showed that these classes of functional interactions are
based on more fine-grained topological signals that are vari-
ations on the overarching topological signatures. Taken together,
graph topological scale spaces clearly capture biologically mean-
ingful features by exploiting, across multiple scales, graph
topology of physical interaction data.

Application of STMs is not limited to protein networks. On
the contrary, they have the potential to play an important role in
answering various questions in the field of network biology. For
instance, several studies have shown that topology-describing
measures can be used to prioritize candidate disease genes
(Ghersi et al., 2013; Kohler et al., 2008). There is also increasing
evidence that the topological structure of brain connectivity
determines many of its functions (Park and Friston, 2013).
We believe that STMs and the associated graph topological
scale spaces can provide new insights in many of these
applications.

5 METHODS

5.1 Measures

Note that, below, we have omitted or for notational convenience and
without loss of generality.

5.1.1 Shortest path The shortest-path measure s(x,y), i.e. the
minimum number of vertices connecting node x and y, can be redeﬁned
to work across the scale-space by noting that K’3 can be rewritten as

,5 ,5

2 3
K‘9 = I+ﬁH+§H2+§H3+H (2)

In this formulation, the contributions of different path lengths are repre-
sented as the different factors (H'), with (H’)w = 0 for all i < s(x,y).
As a result, when ,8 —> 0, the diffusion signal approaches

~ rXJ" s x, )

K5,. _—,(x,y),i8< J (15 e 0) (3)
where rx,y is the number of shortest paths between x and y. All longer
paths [i.e. i >s(x,y)] have negligible contributions, as ,BSO‘J’) > > )5" because
,8 —> 0.

Therefore, taking —log (K3,) gives us —log (rx,,.)+log (s(x, y)!)—
s(x, y) log (,8). Again assuming that ,8 —> 0, then —log (rx, y) + log
(s(x, y)!) will become negligible, and we are left with —s(x, y)log (,8).
As log (,8) is equal for all paths and negative as ,8 —> 0, we remain
with s(x,y), which is the shortest-path length. For interpretation pur-
poses, the —log(,8) factor can be divided out of the measure using the
following scaling factor: max(log(%'),1).

For higher values of ,8 (i.e. an 1ncrease in scale), the shortest-path
measure gradually transforms: through component rx’y, the number of
shortest paths between x and y will be taken into account. Moreover,
because of the other components [with i >s(x,y)], longer paths will also
gradually be incorporated. Intuitively, one may regard this as bundling
(near) shortest paths, where more and more physical paths are covered as
,8 increases. For values of ,8 above 1.0, the focus gradually shifts from
shortest paths to paths of certain length (owing to the balance between )5"
and ii). Finally, for ,8 —>00, and under the condition that there is a
shortest path between x and y, st, —> log (NL.(x)), where Nc(x) represents
the number of nodes connected to x (and thus to y).

Shortest-path STM:sﬁ(x, y) = — log (KfJ)

5.1.2 Jaccard index The Jaccard index is one of many available as-
sociation measures (Fuxman Bass et al., 2013), describing how nodes are
associated in terms of their shared set of interaction partners. It is deﬁned
as J =  where n(x) and n(y) represent the set of neighbors of x and
y, respectively.

In graph topological scale-space, all connected nodes become neigh-
bors, so this deﬁnition cannot be used directly. Instead, we take into
account the strength of each interaction. The intersection is subsequently
deﬁned as the minimum weight of both interactions per interaction part-

ner (Zimin (Kl9 K5,,» and the union as the maximum weight
(ZimaxtKﬁ

x,i’
x,i’

 

5)). This deﬁnition is equal to the original Jaccard for
graphs in which all edges are equally weighted, yet with the deﬁnite ad-
vantage of also being applicable in graph topological scale spaces. For
higher values of ,8, it will represent a Jaccard measure with increasingly
larger neighborhoods, approaching 1 for ,8 —>00.

5.1.3 Degree and closeness centrality The degree centrality reﬂects
the connectivity of a node in terms of the number of edges connected
to it: deg(x). Again, using ,8 —> 0, we ﬁnd that Kfix ~1—deg(x),8.

, ﬂ .
Consequently, I g“ g1ves us a measure of the degree of each node.

 

Increasing ,8 gives us the degree with respect to increasing neighborhoods.

Closeness centrality is classically deﬁned as C(X) =  It reﬂects
the farness of a node x, by summing the shortest-path disfacnces to all other
nodes. This deﬁnition is inadequate for graphs with disconnected compo-
nents. Therefore, an alternative formulation has been suggested
(Dangalchev, 2006): c(x)= 2M 2‘1""). Filling in the shortest-path STM,
we obtain cﬁ(x) = 2M 2l”g(Kf.i) ~ ZN K5”. = 1 — Kﬁix. Apart from a scal-
ing factor ,8, this is the same formulation as was obtained for the degree
centrality STM. We will refer to this combined measure as the ‘centrality’.

Centrality STM: cﬁ(x) = _1’§£x_

5.1.4 Clustering coefﬁcient The clustering coefﬁcient for a node is
deﬁned as the number of edges between its direct neighbors including
itself, divided by the maximum number of possible edges, i.e.
cc(x) = W, where |ex| is the number of edges among the direct
neighbors of node x.

As was observed in the derivation of the Jaccard STM, in the graph
topological scale-space the graph is fully connected. We propose to deﬁne
a generalized scale-aware version of the clustering coefﬁcient as the
weighted average of Jaccard STM of all the interaction partners of x,
i.e. CCﬁ(X) = 2M k(,8)(x, i) >l< J19(x, i). This formulation is not fully equiva-
lent to the standard clustering coefﬁcient when applied to a standard
adjacency graph. A notable difference with the traditional measure is
that edges are downweighted when a ‘neighbor node’ has many links to
nodes outside the cluster. This conforms more closely to the common
notion of an optimal clusterihigh connectivity (low distance) between
nodes within the cluster and low connectivity (large distances) to nodes
outside the cluster. In the formulation proposed here, the size of the
neighborhood (cluster) is deﬁned by the scale parameter ,8.

Clustering coefﬁcient STM: ccﬁ(x) = Z Kﬁiﬂg, i)

r\x
5.1.5 Betweenness centrality The betweenness centrality is deﬁned as
the number of shortest paths that pass through a node, i.e.
b(x) = ZmX  where qij is the number of shortest paths between
nodes i and j, and qij(x) the number of those paths that pass through x.

In graph topological scale-space, the notion of a shortest path
changes, as the graph is fully connected. Note, however, that if
s(x,y) = s(x,z) + s(z, y), we can infer that z is on the shortest path between
x and y, by using the triangle inequality. As a result, we can exploit the
previously deﬁned shortest-path STM. Moreover, instead of discrete
counting, we calculate a continuous score sﬁ(x, y) — (sﬁ(x, z)-l-sﬁ(z, y))
for each node pair x, y and normalize by the total number of pairs N ,
where N is the total number of nodes.

Betweenness centrality STM:
bf (Z) = ii: ZU- (Sﬁbc, y) — (Sﬁ(x, 2) +Sﬁ(z, y)))

5.1.6 From node to link-based S TMs The STMs betweenness cen-
trality, clustering coefﬁcient and centrality are node-based. To extend
their use to link-based classiﬁcation and clustering, the average and the
difference between the node-based STM values are used as measure. This
results in eight link-based STMs (Jaccard and shortest-path STMs and
the average and difference of the three node-based STMs).

5.1.7 From link to node-based S TMs To perform node-based clas-
siﬁcation, link-based STMs were converted to node-based STMs. For the
Jaccard measure, this was already accomplished through the clustering
coefﬁcient STM. Therefore, only the shortest-path measure was con-
verted. This was done in a similar manner as for the clustering coefﬁcient
STM, i.e., Sm) = 2M Kﬁpﬂx, 1)

5.1.8 Values for )3 As values for ,8, we empirically choose a grid of

size 20. Grid points were set according to 222:1 >l< (10.0 — 0.0001) + 0.0001,
with r = 0.0 . . . 1.0 in 20 steps. This results in the following values for ,8:
(0.0001, 0.0134, 0.0312, 0.0550, 0.0869, 0.1296, 0.1868, 0.2634, 0.3659,
0.5031, 0.6869, 0.9330, 1.2624, 1.7035, 2.2941, 3.0848, 4.1435, 5.5610,

7.4589, 10.0000)

 

5.2 Dimension reduction and clustering

The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) dimension re-
duction algorithm was used with a perplexity value of 30 to reduce the
4M x 960 dataset to two dimensions. The t-transforrned distances, which
are used within the t-SNE algorithm to obtain a visualization, were clus-
tered using k-means-based spectral clustering. We used k = 50. This was

followed by a second round of hierarchical clustering, using single link-
age, euclidean distance and a distance threshold of 1% of the data range.

5.3 Supervised analysis

The RNNC from the PRTools toolbox (Duin et al., 2004) was used. This
is a feed-forward neural network with an input layer that scales the data
to unit variance, a layer of 100 sigmoid neurons performing a random
rotation and shift, and an output layer. Forward feature selection was
used to determine the optimal set of features. Classiﬁer performance was
determined using double-loop cross-validation and reported as the AUC.
The inner loop was used for feature selection, whereas the outer loop was
used to determine the ﬁnal performance.

5.3.1 Protein function classification MIPS functional annotations
were used to label proteins. To ensure the presence of enough positive
instances in both testing and training sets, functional categories with <20
genes were not considered. In total, 16 MIPS functional classes (Fig. 2A)
were considered for classiﬁcation.

Classiﬁer performance was determined for each pair of biological func-
tions, using double-loop cross-validation, with a 5-fold inner and 4-fold
outer loop. For each iteration of the outer loop, three folds were used for
training/inner cross-validation, and the remaining fold was used for test-
ing. This resulted in four AUC performance values (which were averaged)
and their SD. Subsequently, these AUC and SDs were averaged for each
functional category.

5.3.2 Interaction classification Gene pairs were labeled according to
their functional interactionino functional relation (neg), co-expression
(coe), genetic (gen) or perturbation (pt). With these labels, six classiﬁca-
tion problems were investigatedineg-coe, neg-gen, neg-pt, coe-gen, coe-
pt, gen-pt. To ensure a balanced classiﬁcation experiment, the number of
examples selected for the neg class was kept equal to the other class.
Classiﬁer examples, represented by gene pairs, were divided into ﬁve
folds. Because of the abundance of interactions available for training a
classiﬁer, we used only one fold for training and four folds for testing in
each iteration. Feature selection was performed on one half of the train-
ing fold, and validation of these features was performed on the other half.
This setup ensures that the data used for training and feature selection are
completely non-overlapping between the iterations of the outer loop.

5.4 Feature selection

The total number of STMs (eight for link-based classiﬁcation) combined
with the 6 different values for or and 20 different values for ,8 results in 960
features (topological descriptors). Forward feature selection was used to
select the most informative features for speciﬁc classiﬁcation tasks. The
AUC score was used as performance measure. Brieﬂy, using the double-
loop cross-validation setup described before, we used the inner cross-val-
idation loop to determine an optimal set of features. We thus obtained a
list of selected features for each iteration of the outer cross-validation
loop, which were then tested on the associated outer validation set (test
set). Obtained performances were averaged. The different feature lists are
summarized in Figure 3.

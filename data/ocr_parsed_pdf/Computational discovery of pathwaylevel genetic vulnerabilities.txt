Abstract

Motivation: Novel approaches are needed for discovery of targeted therapies for non—small—cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) that are specific to certain patients. Whole genome RNAi screening of lung
cancer cell lines provides an ideal source for determining candidate drug targets.

Results: Unsupervised learning algorithms uncovered patterns of differential vulnerability across
lung cancer cell lines to loss of functionally related genes. Such genetic vulnerabilities represent
candidate targets for therapy and are found to be involved in splicing, translation and protein fold—
ing. In particular, many NSCLC cell lines were especially sensitive to the loss of components of the
LSm2—8 protein complex or the CCT/TRiC chaperonin. Different vulnerabilities were also found for
different cell line subgroups. Furthermore, the predicted vulnerability of a single adenocarcinoma
cell line to loss of the Wnt pathway was experimentally validated with screening of small—molecule
Wnt inhibitors against an extensive cell line panel.

Availability and implementation: The clustering algorithm is implemented in Python and is freely

1 Introduction

 

Non—small—cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a significant health—
care burden despite recent progress in drug discovery and develop—
ment. Recent FDA—approved targeted therapies are only intended
for appropriate subpopulations of patients. The drug Xalkori (crizo—
tinib) is highly effective, but only for ~4% of lung cancer patients
(Shaw and Engelman, 2013). Similarly, Iressa (gefitinib) and other
EGFR inhibitors target mutations found only in a portion of patients

while the majority have the Wild—type version (Laurie and G055,
2013). Compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy
has the advantage of greater specificity. However, discovery and de—
velopment of such agents requires the identification of druggable
targets. Inhibitors of certain characteristic mutations, such as KRAS
G12C and G12D, are still under extensive development for clinical
use (Cox et (11., 2014; Hunter et (11., 2014). The heterogeneity of
NSCLC is another barrier confronting drug discovery. A number of

different subtypes exist, and identifying the appropriate patient sub—
population for therapy is crucial. Therefore, the problem becomes
one of identifying druggable targets in NSCLC that will guide dis—
covery of small—molecule compounds or antibodies against these tar—
gets, and also to identify the patient subpopulations to which the
targets apply. We attempt to tackle the former issue through compu—
tational analysis of a high—throughput whole genome RNA interfer—
ence (RNAi) screen against a panel of NSCLC cell lines.

When identifying drug targets, one approach is to identify genes
whose knockdown selectively leads to death of cancer cells but not
matched normal cells. Such genes represent genetic vulnerabilities
and potential drug targets. Several studies have been able to use
whole genome RNAi to identify genetic vulnerabilities for cancer
drug target discovery. A screen against all genes in two lung cancer
cell lines identified proteasome members as candidate targets and
discovered that small—molecule proteasome inhibition synergized
with radiotherapy in a mouse xenograft model (Cron et al., 2013).
Another study applied a whole genome shRNA screen on lung can—
cer cell lines to discover genes that were part of the Wnt pathway
whose knockout potentiates EGFR inhibition (Casas—Selves et al.,
2012).

For drug discovery, it is desirable to investigate many cell lines.
A major effort, termed Project Achilles, involved RNAi knockdown
of more than 11 000 human genes using shRNA libraries in over
100 cancer cell lines. Ovarian cancer cell lines were found to be es—
pecially dependent upon ~50 genes (Cheung et al., 2011). A follow—
up study sought to uncover essential cancer genes based on the
hypothesis that certain genes that are not themselves oncogenes but
show copy—number loss could be cancer vulnerabilities. A scoring
scheme was developed to prioritize genes that were essential to can—
cer cell lines and also exhibited partial copy number loss (Nijhawan
et al., 2012). Recently, independent of Project Achilles, extensive
high—throughput chemical and genetic screens were employed to ex—
plore new avenues of treating NSCLC. The study found molecular
signatures of FLIP and COPI addiction and indolotriazine sensitivity
that indicate genetic vulnerabilities present in patient populations
(Kim et al., 2013). The genetic screens leading to these results
included siRNA screening of a number of lung cancer cell lines. This
screening was ultimately conducted on a whole genome scale, which
motivated this study.

Here, we propose a novel computational approach to prioritize
candidate drug targets for NSCLC by subdividing cell lines into dif—
ferent groups and identifying genetic vulnerabilities targeted to each
group. In particular, we aim to attain a binary partitioning of cell
lines into either sensitive or resistant to targeting of a particular gen—
etic vulnerability. We are interested only in genetic vulnerabilities
that sensitize a subgroup of cell lines rather than all cell lines because
due to the genetic heterogeneity of lung cancer, an effective universal
treatment for all NSCLC types is not thought to exist. Applications
of unsupervised learning algorithms were developed that identify
biological processes and protein complexes to which NSCLC cell
lines are differentially sensitive upon siRNA knockdown. The top—
scoring results represent lung cancer genetic vulnerabilities and can—
didate therapy targets.

2 Methods

2.1 Experimental datasets and procedures
Our study centers on a cell line panel consisting of 12 patient—
derived NSCLC cell lines and one immortalized normal epithelial

cell line (Supplementary Table S1). Included among the cell lines are
subtypes commonly observed in patients: adenocarcinoma, squa—
mous—cell and large—cell carcinoma. As described previously (Kim
et al., 2013), a whole genome knockdown screen with Ambion and
Dharmacon siRNA libraries in the 96—well plate format was con—
ducted against the cell line panel. For each gene, either three siRNAs
(Ambion) or four siRNAs (Dharmacon) were pooled, and cell line
viability was measured using the CellTiter—Glo (Promega) assay.
Raw data were row and column median normalized. Using siMacro
(Singh et al., 2013), a robust Z score was calculated from the screen—
ing data to reﬂect the viability of each cell line to knockdown of a
single gene. A robust Z score is defined as

Cell viability — median

Z : é
Medlan absolute dev1atlon

and is less sensitive to outliers than a traditional Z score. Both the
median and median absolute deviation were calculated over data
grouped by experimental batch.

It was determined that robust Z scores less than —3.0 reﬂected
non—viability. Scores were combined from both Ambion and
Dharmacon libraries by taking the minimum of the scores. Thus, it
was assumed that disagreement between the results of the two libra—
ries were more likely to be due to false—negatives. The siRNA screen
Z scores were further simplified by binarizing as follows. All robust
Z scores less than —3.0 were set equal to 1; otherwise the score was
set equal to 0. In essence, a binarized score of 1 represents a hit or
sensitivity of a cell line to the corresponding gene knockdown.

A larger pool of NSCLC cell lines encompassing the cell line
panel described above was screened with the tankyrase inhibitors
IWR—1—endo (Calbiochem) and XAV 939 (Tocris) in an 8—point
4—fold dilution series (top dose : 100 (AM) in 96—well plates. Cells
were plated 24 h prior to the addition of drug, incubated for 4 days,
and assayed using MTS (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Promega). Cell number per well was determined empirically and
ranged from 500 to 4000 per well, inversely proportional to dou—
bling times (typically 2000/well). Dose response curves were gener—
ated and IC5 05 calculated using in—house software, DIVISA. All cells
were grown in RPMI—1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 5% FBS and
incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% C02. Cell
lines were authenticated using the Power—Plex 1.2 kit (Promega) and
confirmed to match the DNA fingerprint library maintained by
ATCC and the Minna/Gazdar laboratory and confirmed to be free
of mycoplasma by e—Myco kit (Boca Scientific).

RNAi screens of cancer cell lines from Project Achilles (Cowley
et al., 2014) were utilized as an external comparison dataset for our
study. Results from shRNA knockdown of 5711 genes on 19
NSCLC cell lines were extracted from Project Achilles v2.4.3. NaN
values were imputed by replacement with row medians. No thresh—
olding of the data was carried out so viability was assessed on a con—
tinuous spectrum. We followed the Project Achilles’ convention of
identifying lower gene knockdown values with greater essentiality
and higher values with reduced essentiality. A number of genes were
associated with multiple knockdown values for each cell line; these
data were kept as is.

2.2 Application of k—means clustering

The gene sets examined for genetic vulnerabilities were protein com—
plexes chosen from CORUM (Ruepp et al., 2010) and literature
sources (Havugimana et al., 2012; http://metazoa.med.utoronto.ca).

Computational discovery of pathway—level genetic vulnerabilities in NSCLC 1375

 

The full RNAi data were represented as a m X 71 matrix M where m
is the number of genes, 71 is the number of cell lines, and

{ 0, if cell line / survives knockdown of gene 1'
z] :

1, otherwise

Extracting the RNAi sensitivity profiles for genes in a protein
complex yields a r X n submatrix P of M where r is the number of
genes in the complex. Thus, every protein complex is represented as
a matrix of ones and zeros.

For each protein complex, we measured the degree of bimodal
response to gene knockdowns as follows. Denoting by P the matrix
for a protein complex as above, we computed a vector v by calculat—
ing the column means of P: P : v,- : (1/r)Z::1P,-,-. Then k—means
clustering with k : 2 was applied to v, and the difference between
the resulting centroids was the score assigned to each protein com—
plex. By calculating the column means, we normalized for the size of
the complex. We considered two different implementations of the
k—means clustering algorithm. First, we used the standard implemen—
tation found in the Python library scikit—learn, which runs the algo—
rithm 10 times with different centroid seeds, choosing the result on
the basis of the within—cluster sum—of—squares (Pedregosa et al.,
2011). The technique from k—means ++ was followed for centroid
initialization (Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007). Second, an alternative
implementation was Ckmeanslddp, which employs dynamic pro—
gramming to guarantee optimal solutions for the one—dimensional
case (Wang and Song, 2011).

A permutation test to determine statistical significance was per—
formed in the following manner. For each protein complex, the en—
tire RNAi data for all genes were permuted, followed by repeating
the k—means clustering on the same complex. The permutations
were repeated 1000 times to generate a distribution of scores from
the randomized data. Then the score from the actual complex was
compared with the distribution to calculate a P—value. For every pro—
tein complex, this entire process of generating a distribution of
scores from permuted data to compare against the complex’s actual
score to yield a P—value was repeated. Finally, multiple hypothesis
correction at 10% FDR was carried out using the q—value statistical
package (Storey, 2002). One alternative to the permutation test in
assessing statistical significance is Fisher’s exact test. Specifically, for
each protein complex, a contingency table was tabulated according
to the number of viable and non—viable gene knockdowns, and
which cell line cluster (according to the 2—means clustering) those
knockdowns fell within. The Bonferroni correction at 10% FDR
was applied to the P—values from Fisher’s exact test.

A procedure to benchmark the performance of the 2—means clus—
tering method was based on a leave—one—out strategy. For each pro—
tein complex, a single gene member was randomly withheld. The
remaining gene members formed a training set, on which the
2—means clustering was calculated. The clustering resulted in assign—
ments of cell lines to either a knockdown—sensitive or knockdown—
resistant cluster. Using these assignments, we tested whether the
average number of RNAi hits in the sensitive cell lines for the with—
held gene was greater than that of the resistant lines. To assess for
statistical significance in the training set, multiple hypothesis correc—
tion was performed using a permutation test as described above. A
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted from the
test set consisting of the withheld genes, given that the correspond—
ing training samples were statistically significant. This benchmark—
ing procedure was repeated multiple times and a mean ROC curve
was generated by vertical averaging.

2.3 Biclustering

Independent of the 2—means clustering approach, a second method
was employed to detect NSCLC genetic vulnerabilities without reli—
ance on annotated gene sets. The entire RNAi knockdown dataset
was represented as a matrix as described above, where each row is a
gene knockdown and each column is a cell line. The Large Average
Submatrix (LAS) biclustering algorithm was applied to this matrix
to uncover biclusters in which the rows (genes) exhibit similar be—
havior across a set of columns (cell lines) (Shabalin et al., 2009). In
particular, the desired biclusters have the property of being large in
average value relative to other submatrices of similar size and repre—
sent biological systems to which certain NSCLC cell lines are espe—
cially dependent. The genes corresponding to each bicluster were
then used to query the Database for Annotation, Visualization and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID) for functional enrichment (Huang
et al., 2009a, 2009b). We also searched each bicluster for enrich—
ment of protein complexes by calculating the hypergeometric prob—
ability of obtaining at least the observed number of overlap between
a complex and the bicluster genes. Statistical significance of complex
enrichment was controlled at 5% FDR by the Benjamini—Hochberg
procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

2.4 Alternative methods for determination of gene set
sensitivity

We also considered alternative measures of gene set sensitivity. For
every cell line within each gene set, the probability of observing the
number of ‘hit’ genes (gene knockdowns producing non—viability)
was computed according to a hypergeometric distribution. The re—
sulting probabilities for each line were then multiplied together to
obtain an overall score for the gene set. Statistical significance of the
scores was found using a permutation test, as was done for the
2—means clustering.

3 Results

From a whole genome RNAi screen of NSCLC cell lines, we identi—
fied candidate drug targets in the form of genetic vulnerabilities spe—
cific to cell line subgroups. A couple of factors were considered
when determining genetic vulnerabilities. First, given the heterogen—
eity of NSCLC, gene deletions that are almost universally toxic
across the cell line panel would likely be toxic to other normal
human cells as well. In addition, it is desirable to specifically target
lung cancer cells but not normal cells, yet only one cell line in the
panel was from a non—cancerous normal lineage. This suggests that
in the interest of specificity, the number of cell lines constituting a
genetic vulnerability should not be too large. On the other hand, a
vulnerability consisting of a single cell line may be less likely to gen—
eralize to an appreciable number of patients. Therefore, the chal—
lenge stems from identifying groups of genes to which some, but not
all, NSCLC cell lines are especially dependent. Ideally, these cell
lines would represent a particular patient subpopulation. Another
challenge was to avoid a combinatorially intractable problem of
having to examine all possible combinations of cell lines against all
possible combinations of genes. Novel applications of unsupervised
learning algorithms were developed to overcome these challenges to
prioritize potential NSCLC targets from RNAi sensitivities.

The general workﬂow of this study is outlined in Figure 1. From
the whole genome RNAi screen on 12 NSCLC cell lines and one
normal epithelial line, we extracted knockdown sensitivity profiles
for selected gene sets. Each gene set was clustered, scored and

Fig. 1. Gene sets with bimodal sensitivity represent NSCLC vulnerabilities.
RNAi sensitivity profiles were extracted for selected gene sets (six examples
shown). A ranking scheme was designed to prioritize gene sets whose knock-
down leads to a bimodal response of cell lines

ranked by statistical significance. The clustering score measures the
degree to which the cell lines segregate into sensitive and resistant
groups upon knockdown of genes in the set. Gene sets with a clear
segregation of sensitive and resistant lines are termed bimodal. It is
imperative that our scoring scheme prioritizes such bimodal sets
over other patterns of RNAi sensitivity that would be less desirable
as a candidate drug target. For example, gene sets that are all toxic
or half—toxic are undesirable due to predicted toxicity beyond those
in our cell line panel. In addition, gene sets that are largely resistant
or having a random pattern of sensitivity clearly would not be
desired as well.

3.1 Subgroup—specific NSCLC vulnerabilities are found
among protein complexes

The selected gene sets we chose to examine were 2820 protein com—
plexes. As calculated by the 2—means clustering approach, 35 had
statistically significant scores at 10% FDR from a permutation test
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Fisher’s exact test also determined 33 of
those 35 complexes to be highly statistically significant
(Supplementary Fig. S3c). We found that the standard k—means algo—
rithm and the 1—D optimal k—means method, Ckmeanslddp,
yielded identical results although Ckmeanslddp demonstrated
marked runtime speedup. Finally, simulations of a synthetic dataset
showed that the permutation test for statistical significance was not
biased toward larger or smaller complexes (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Fig. 2. k—means clustering uncovers differential essentiality of NSCLC cell
lines to protein complexes. The clustering partitions the cell line panel into
two groups: sensitive and insensitive to loss of components of the complex.
Shown are eight of 35 protein complexes that yielded statistically significant
scores (10% FDR)

Overall, the 2—means clustering method found strong genetic vul—
nerabilities including components of splicing and translation
(Fig. 2). The top—ranking gene sets are protein complexes that all ex—
hibit the desired bimodal behavior, in which one particular group of
cell lines is far more vulnerable to loss of components in the complex
than the other cell lines. Notably, the HBEC30 normal cell line did
not generally show sensitivity to knockdown of any of the top—
ranking vulnerabilities.

RNA splicing is a major category of lung cancer vulnerabilities,
as evidenced by the RNAi sensitivity patterns of the LSm2—8, 17S U2
snRNP and CDC5L complexes. Components of the translation ma—
chinery, represented by the eIF3 complex and ribosome small sub—
unit, constitute another major class of vulnerabilities. Two notable
candidate drug targets are the proteasome and the CCT/TRiC chap—
eronin complex, which gives one of the cleanest signals in terms of
clustering the cell lines into sensitive and insensitive groups.

Moreover, different cell line subgroups exhibit different sensitiv—
ities. For example, HCC95, HCC44, H460 and H2122 are espe—
cially vulnerable to loss of the LSm2—8 complex, while a slightly
broader cell line set is highly dependent upon the CCT complex. A
few cell lines, particularly HCC95, are frequently sensitive to many
of the genetic vulnerabilities. For some of the genetic vulnerabilities,
the cell lines affected do not belong to a single histological subtype.
Rather, they encompass at least one of the three main NSCLC sub—
types of adenocarcinoma, squamous—cell and large—cell carcinoma.

In assessing the performance of our 2—means clustering by a
leave—one—out strategy, only protein complexes above a certain size

were considered. For complexes with at least five members, the
2—means clustering achieves a mean AUC of 0.62, with the average
being computed over five iterations of withholding a random gene
from each complex. When considering protein complexes containing
at least eight members, a mean AUC of 0.66 is attained over eight it—
erations (Supplementary Fig. S2).

We applied our 2—means clustering method to data from Project
Achilles on sensitivity of 19 NSCLC cell lines to shRNA knockdown
of 5 711 genes. Due to the lower coverage of genes compared to our
whole genome knockdown dataset, the 2—means clustering is able to
be applied to only a portion of many of the protein complexes.
According to a permutation test, we were unable to find any statis—
tically significant protein complexes at the same FDR 10% level
previously used. The top scoring result is a ribosomal complex, fol—
lowed by two proteasome complexes. A majority of the significant
protein complexes found from our own RNAi dataset also maintain
the general pattern of partitioning into sensitive and resistant cell
lines in the Project Achilles experiment (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Because no statistical significance was found, we did not carry out
the benchmarking procedure as above.

3.2 Biclustering finds genetic vulnerabilities without
reliance on annotated gene sets

LAS biclustering was employed as an independent and complemen—
tary approach to identifying candidate drug targets. The 2—means
clustering approach relies on annotated gene sets, namely protein
complexes, to address the challenge of selecting gene groups to inter—
rogate for bimodal response to RNAi knockdown. On the other
hand, biclustering offered an alternative strategy to tackle this chal—
lenge as it could find genetic vulnerabilities without regard to any
prior annotation. The LAS algorithm found 22 statistically signifi—
cant biclusters with Bonferroni—corrected P—values <1075. Of the
top 10 highest ranking biclusters, the first represents a nearly univer—
sally toxic set—all of the lung cancer cell lines are vulnerable to loss
of almost any of the genes. The next best—ranking results are those
which are toxic only to a single cell line. The lower—ranked statistic—
ally significant biclusters tend to represent vulnerabilities for a

Fig. 3. Biclustering finds strong vulnerability of H2073 to loss of Wnt signal-
ing. (A) The seventh-ranked bicluster, containing 1154 genes, is enriched for
the Wnt pathway. (B) The sensitivity profile of the gene set comprising the
functional enrichment shows sensitivity of H2073 to knockdown of any of the
genes in the set. (C) Screening of lWR-1 and XAV939 against an expanded
panel of NSCLC cell lines (each denoted by a diamond) indeed shows that
H2073 is markedly vulnerable to chemical inhibition of the Wnt pathway

broader set of cell lines (Supplementary Table S2). Functional en—
richment was not found for three of the top 10 results. In addition,
searching each bicluster for enrichment of protein complexes yielded
heavy enrichment for the spliceosome. For most of the biclusters,
the functions of the enriched protein complexes match those found
from the DAVID enrichment (Supplementary Table S3).

Many of the protein complexes from 2—means clustering also par—
ticipate in biological processes found in LAS biclustering (Table 1).
In particular, there appears to be frequent enrichment for translation
and splicing, which are the functions of the ribosome small subunit,
and the LSm2—8, CDC5L and 17S U2 snRNP complexes. No func—
tional enrichment was found for the bicluster genes affecting
HBEC30, which was also often resistant to knockdown of the pro—
tein complexes prioritized by 2—means clustering. Interestingly in
2—means clustering, HCC4017, HCC366, and H1819 were mostly
among the groups of resistant cell lines although in biclustering,
their genes were enriched in translation, splicing and proteasome
components. Upon closer examination, the genes responsible for
this enrichment are different from those comprising the translation,
splicing and proteasome protein complexes. Apparently, biclustering
complements the 2—means clustering in uncovering certain genetic
vulnerabilities not found by the latter. We also note that the Wnt
pathway, which is enriched in the 7th—ranked bicluster, was not dis—
covered by the 2—means clustering as many of its genes either did not
appear in our protein complex set or were only present individually
in single complexes.

3.3 Small—molecule screen confirms predicted cell line
sensitivity

One notable bicluster showed enrichment for the Wnt pathway
(Fig. 3A and B). The H2073 adenocarcinoma cell was highly vulner—
able to loss of Wnt pathway members. This suggests that small—mol—
ecule compounds targeting Wnt should reproduce the RNAi gene
knockdown sensitivity pattern when tested on the cell line panel.
Two Wnt inhibitors, IWR—1 and XAV939, were screened on a larger
group of cell lines encompassing the panel, and the results confirmed

the predicted sensitivity (Fig. 3C). The two compounds had a select—
ive deleterious effect on H2073 while essentially sparing the other
cell lines. Each cell line denoted by a diamond was colored accord—
ing to a normal mixture model that predicted the number of groups.
If there were two groups, green and red were used for sensitive and
resistant, respectively. Otherwise, the diamonds were colored gray.

3.4 Alternative approaches to measuring complex
sensitivity do not prioritize bimodality

We evaluated several other methods to measure complex sensitivity.
These approaches depended on annotated gene sets, as opposed to
biclustering, which has no such constraints. Cell line viability results
from our whole genome screen are not approximately normally dis—
tributed (Supplementary Fig. S3a), which precludes the use of a sim—
ple z—test comparing the complex members’ scores to the
background distribution. Even if the data were normally distributed
(as the Project Achilles data is), this method would not distinguish
bimodal from half—toxic complexes (Supplementary Fig. S3b), and
in fact would prioritize universally toxic complexes.

We also considered using the hypergeometric distribution to as—
sess the significance of multiple occurrences of sensitivity within a
protein complex. From a permutation test, we found 544 statistic—
ally significant protein complexes at FDR 10% (Supplementary Fig.
S3d). With the large number of protein complexes being statistically
significant, we felt that this method was less discriminative than the
2—means clustering approach in prioritizing complexes.

4 Discussion

Collectively, the protein complexes we discovered to be NSCLC
genetic vulnerabilities span various cellular processes including
splicing, translation and protein folding. It is natural to ask how
they fit in with currently established cancer therapies and whether
known drugs could be repurposed for these complexes. Clearly, they
contrast with hormonal therapy or the usual mitotic targets of cyto—
toxic chemotherapy. It turns out that some of the strongest genetic
vulnerabilities are known targets of small—molecules.

Arsenic trioxide (AszO3) targets the TRiC/CCT complex (Pan
et al., 2010) and has been used to treat acute promyelocytic leuke—
mia in patients who did not respond well to other types of chemo—
therapy (Shen et al., 1997; Soignet et al., 1998, 2001). AszO3 can
perhaps be repurposed for NSCLC, particularly for patients whose
tumors bear similarity to the sensitive cell line subgroups identified
from the 2—means clustering analysis. Several studies have evaluated
the effect of AszO3 in human lung primary fibroblasts and in the
lung cancer cell lines A549 and H460 (Li et al., 2009; Park and
Kim, 2012). Collectively, they suggest that H460 is markedly more
sensitive to AszO3 than lung fibroblasts, consistent with the CCT
complex vulnerability we observed.

We also identified the proteasome as a candidate NSCLC drug
target and recently, proteasome inhibitors have been investigated as
anti—cancer agents. One such inhibitor is Velcade (bortezomib),
which has been FDA—approved for multiple myeloma (Kisselev
et al., 2012). Bortezomib has shown to be effective in combination
with other chemotherapy agents for NSCLC (Davies et al., 2007)
and has been evaluated in clinical trials for NSCLC as well (Besse
et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2012; Piperdi et al., 2012). This also sug—
gests that newer and more specific proteasome inhibitors, such as
Kyprolis (carfilzomib) could be efficacious for patients with
NSCLC.

In addition, translation and splicing emerged as strong genetic
vulnerabilities from the 2—means analysis. Previously, translation has
been proposed as a potential target in cancer (Grzmil and
Hemmings, 2012). Moreover, eIF3 is known to be overexpressed in
lung cancers (Pincheira et al., 2001), and ectopic expression of five
eIF3 subunits has been shown to transform immortalized fibroblasts
into malignant cells (Zhang et al., 2007). Notably, in our study we
found that knockdown of four of those five subunits strongly sensi—
tizes six of the 12 NSCLC cell lines in our panel, while an immortal—
ized epithelial line is comparatively unaffected (Fig. 2). The splicing
apparatus has been suggested as a cancer target as well (Grosso
et al., 2008; van Alphen et al., 2009). Of the splicing—associated pro—
tein complexes discovered from the 2—means analysis (Fig. 2), the
SF3b component of U2 snRNP is known to be targeted by a number
of small—molecule compounds. Both the pladienolides and meaya—
mycin target SF3b, and the latter has been shown to be more dele—
terious in human lung cancer cells than normal lung fibroblasts
(Albert et al., 2009; Bonnal et al., 2012).

Some of the NSCLC genetic vulnerabilities that were found by
our computational analysis include protein complexes that may ap—
pear to be entirely essential. It is perhaps surprising that certain cell
lines are largely resistant to knockdown of many of these genes. One
explanation may simply be a result of the strict thresholding of the
RNAi data to produce binary readings of cell line viability, which
could be affected by the <100% sensitivity of the assay. Another ex—
planation may be provided by essential gene ‘moonlighting’ and
‘ﬂipping’ of protein complex essentiality between distantly related
species (Ryan et al., 2013). It was shown that certain protein com—
plexes almost completely ﬂip essentiality between Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. A similar phenomenon
may be occurring among our NSCLC cell line panel. Although the
cell lines are not necessarily distantly related, they likely differ suffi—
ciently due to different mutational compositions. Different yeast
species ﬂip protein complex essentiality as a result of adaptations to
differing needs and environments, a phenomenon likely common to
cancer cells as well. Moreover, particular NSCLC cell lines are
largely resistant to loss of most, but not all, members of certain pro—
tein complexes. Those genes that are mostly essential in both sensi—
tive and insensitive cell line subgroups could exhibit ‘moonlighting’
behavior by having multiple functions in both essential and nones—
sential processes.

The NSCLC genetic vulnerabilities uncovered by the computa—
tional analysis described here extends an earlier study (Kim et al.,
2013) in uncovering additional potential targets for therapy that
were not previously reported. While our study shares the general
aim of identifying genetic vulnerabilities, we exclusively focus on
identification of biological systems, such as protein complexes, that
certain lung cancers are especially dependent upon. Our results also
present a complementary viewpoint to the Project Achilles effort in
analyzing whole genome RNAi knockdown of cancer cells. One
goal from Project Achilles was to discover genes that simultaneously
had partial copy number loss and were essential to cancer cells
(Nijhawan et al., 2012). Interestingly, the results from that analysis
found single gene vulnerabilities in splicing, translation and the pro—
teasome as well. One such vulnerability was LSM4, which is a part
of the LSm2—8 complex. A key difference is that the NSCLC vulner—
abilities presented here are from the viewpoint of looking not only
at single genes but biological systems such as protein complexes. In
contrast with previous analyses, we obtain cell line subgroups that
may represent particular patient populations along with candidate
targets for each of those subgroups.

Computational discovery of pathway—level genetic vulnerabilities in NSCLC 1379

 

5 Summary

Novel candidate drug targets were found from computational ana—
lysis of a whole genome RNAi knockdown screen in NSCLC cell
lines. The targets are protein complexes specific for particular lung
cancer cell lines and function in splicing, translation and protein
folding. Results of previous studies support further investigation of
these protein complexes as avenues of therapeutic intervention in
NSCLC. Moreover, the candidate targets provide an opportunity
for drug repurposing, which could lead to reduced time in the drug
development pipeline. Our results simultaneously establish lung can—
cer cell line subgroups and potentially novel druggable targets that
are specific to each subgroup. This study contributes to a deeper
understanding of therapeutically relevant events at the molecular
scale in NSCLC.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The reconstruction of metabolic networks at the
genome scale has allowed the analysis of metabolic pathways at an
unprecedented level of complexity. Elementary flux modes (EFMs)
are an appropriate concept for such analysis. However, their number
grows in a combinatorial fashion as the size of the metabolic network
increases, which renders the application of EFMs approach to large
metabolic networks difficult. Novel methods are expected to deal
with such complexity.

Results: In this article, we present a novel optimization-based
method for determining a minimal generating set of EFMs, Le. a
convex basis. We show that a subset of elements of this convex basis
can be effectively computed even in large metabolic networks. Our
method was applied to examine the structure of pathways producing
lysine in Escherichia coli. We obtained a more varied and informative
set of pathways in comparison with existing methods. In addition, an
alternative pathway to produce lysine was identified using a detour
via propionyl-CoA, which shows the predictive power of our novel
approach.

1 INTRODUCTION

During the last decade, different approaches have been proposed
to explore the structure of complex metabolic networks from a
pathway-oriented perspective (Klamt and Stelling, 2003). As in
other methods (Price et (11., 2004), these approaches are mainly built
upon the steady state condition and irreversibility (thermodynamic)
constraints, which deﬁne a polyhedral cone, typically referred to

as the ﬂux cone. In particular, pathway-based methods search
for solutions in the ﬂux cone that satisfy a simplicity condition,
technically the non-decomposability condition. These properties
were condensed in the deﬁnition of elementary ﬂux mode (EFM)
in the work of Schuster and Hilgetag (1994).

Since its introduction, the concept of EFM has received much
attention, showing that a wide range of questions in bioengineering
and bioinformatics can be addressed using such an approach
(Schuster et (11., 2007; Trinh et (11., 2009). In particular, the prediction
of novel biologically meaningful pathways constitutes one of the
most important applications of EFM analysis. An example is the
in silico prediction via EFM analysis of the PEP-glyoxylate cycle
(Liao et (11., 1996; Schuster et (11., 1999), which was later conﬁrmed
experimentally (Fischer and Sauer, 2003).

However, due to combinatorial explosion (Klamt and Stelling,
2002), the computation of EFMs is not easy and, until recently, their
analysis has been restricted to small metabolic networks. In this
context, Terzer and Stelling (2008), have presented an improved
method that expands the applicability of the EFMs approach
to moderate-size metabolic networks; however, large metabolic
networks remain beyond the capabilities of current algorithms. We
have recently shown that the K -shortest EFMs (for small K values)
can be calculated in large networks, even at the genome scale, using
integer linear programming (de Figueiredo et (11., 2009). The use
of optimization introduces more ﬂexibility into EFM computation
and, therefore, the direct exploration of a particular subset of EFMs
of interest can be accomplished without having ﬁrst to compute the
full set of EFMs. This represents a clear advantage with respect
to previous methods (Klamt et (11., 2005; Schilling et (11., 2000;
Schuster et (11., 2000; Terzer and Stelling, 2008; Urbanczik and
Wagner, 2005).

A concept related to EFMs is that of convex basis. First introduced
in Pfeiffer et (11. (1999), it was deﬁned as a minimal set of EFMs that
generate the solution space. This means that any vector in the ﬂux
cone, in particular any other EFM not included in this minimal set,
can be written as a non-negative linear combination of the elements
of the basis. For this reason, a convex basis is typically referred to as
a minimal generating set and elements of this basis as generating ﬂux
modes, GFMs (Wagner and Urbanczik, 2005). However, the convex

basis is generally non-unique and does not necessarily involve all
biochemical relevant pathways. Consequently, other mathematical
descriptions of metabolism have been preferred over GFMs. In
particular, special interest has been attracted by the extreme pathway
approach (Schilling et (11., 2000), in which the network conﬁguration
is modiﬁed to overcome the non-uniqueness issue. Moreover, the
number of GFMs and extreme pathways is lower than the number
of EFMs.

The comparison between EFMs, extreme pathways and GFMs
has been extensively addressed in the literature (Klamt and Stelling,
2003; Wagner and Urbanczik, 2005). This discussion is less relevant
in large metabolic networks, since the ﬁill computation of EFMs and
GFMs (and extreme pathways) is not possible due to combinatorial
explosion. Instead, current research has been more devoted to
identify novel methods to deal with such complexity and explore the
EFM and GFM solution spaces (de Figueiredo et (11., 2009; Kaleta
et (11., 2009). This is in fact the main purpose of this article, namely to
present a new method for computing a subset of GFMs in large-scale
metabolic networks.

Recently, Larhlimi and Bockmayr (2009) have presented a new
constraint-based description of the ﬂux cone. Based on the concept
and properties of ‘minimal metabolic behaviours’ introduced in
that paper, we adapted the K—shortest EFMs method presented in
de Figueiredo et (11. (2009), to calculate GFMs. Similarly to the
K -shortest EFM approach, our method can be (in theory) applied to
enumerate a ﬁill set of GFMs. However, it is particularly useﬁil
for large networks, where classical methods are not applicable
(Urbanczik and Wagner, 2005). In these cases, our method allows the
effective computation of a subset of GFMs by directly calculating
only those GFMs that involve a particular reaction or metabolite of
interest.

We present below the details of our mathematical optimization
model for calculating GFMs. We used the standard network
conﬁguration and convex basis deﬁnition presented in Pfeiffer
et (11. (1999), as will become apparent in Section 2. Our approach,
however, can be easily adapted to calculate extreme pathways
just by changing the network conﬁguration as deﬁned in Schilling
et (11. (2000). We then examine the predictive power of our GFMs
approach to ﬁnd pathways producing the commercially important
amino acid L—lysine in the genome-scale metabolic network of
Escherichia coli (Feist et (11., 2007). The results are analyzed and
compared with our previous method presented in de Figueiredo
et (11., 2009. We show that our GFM approach presents a more
descriptive and varied set of pathways than the K -shortest EFMs
method. As a result of our analysis, we hypothesize a novel pathway
to produce L—lysine in E.c01i using propionyl-CoA (ppcoa).

2 METHODS

In this section, we present a novel mathematical method to calculate a subset
(and, in principle, even a full set) of GFMs, i.e. a convex basis. Before
describing this method, a brief introduction to metabolic network theory is
carried out.

2.1 Deﬁnitions

Consider a metabolic network that comprises R reactions and C metabolites.
Each reaction is associated with a ﬂux variable v,, r=1, ...,R where
v=[v1, ...,vR] is the ﬂux vector. Irr denotes the set of irreversible reactions,
which satisfy the (qualitative) thermodynamic constraints, i.e. v,ZO, reIrr.

Note that reversible reactions are not split into forward and backward
reactions, as opposed to other approaches, e.g. Schilling et (11., 2000, where
splitting into two irreversible steps is accomplished. The set of metabolites
is divided into two subsets, namely external (E) and internal (1) metabolites.
For internal metabolites, it is assumed that no accumulation or depletion
is possible, therefore steady-state condition holds, i.e. Zfdscrvrza Ce],
where so, is the stoichiometric coefﬁcient associated with compound 0
(0:1, ...,C) in reaction r (r21, ...,R). As usual in the literature (Schilling
et (11., 2000; Schuster et (11., 2000), substrates and products have negative
and positive stoichiometric coefﬁcients, respectively. External metabolites
are typically considered as sources and sinks.

The set of ﬂux vectors that satisfy the thermodynamic and steady state
constraints deﬁnes a polyhedral cone, P, deﬁned as

R
P: v|Zsc,v,=0, Ce]; v,ZO, reIrr (1)

r2]

Aside from being contained in the ﬂux cone P, EFMs are solutions that
satisfy a simplicity condition, namely the non-decomposability condition,
which establishes that any subset of the reactions involved in an EFM cannot
carry ﬂux in steady state (Schuster et (11., 2000).

As in Pfeiffer et (11., 1999, a convex basis is deﬁned here as a minimal
set of EFMs that generates the solution space. Elements of a convex
basis were termed above generating ﬂux modes, GFMs. A convex basis
deﬁnes two different subsets of GFMs, namely B reversible GFMs and
G irreversible GFMs. While an irreversible GFM involves at least one
irreversible reaction, a reversible GFM involves no irreversible reactions.
Reversible and irreversible GFMs are denoted here in vectorial form,
bj,j=1,...,B and g,»,i=1,...,G, respectively.

Any ﬂux vector v in the polyhedral cone P can be generated as a linear
combination with non-negative coefﬁcients A, for irreversible GFMs and
with unrestricted signed coefﬁcients 11]- for reversible GFMs.

v=ZAigi+Zujbj, (2)

1:1
veP, 1,30, i=1,...,G;—oo<;1j<oo,j=1,...,B;

We describe below how reversible and irreversible GFMs can be
separately determined.

2.2 Reversible GFMs

The determination of the reversible GFMs of a convex basis can be
accomplished using the concept of reversible metabolic space (RMS), as
introduced in Larhlimi and Bockmayr, 2009. RMS is deﬁned as the linear
subspace in which the irreversible reactions carry no ﬂux:

RMS={veP | v,=0, VreIrr} (3)

Accordingly, the set of reversible GFMs (b1- , j=1, ...,B) is a linear basis of
RMS, namely:

8
v=Zt1jbj,veRMS, —oo<;1j<oo,j=1,...,B; (4)
j:1

Finding a linear basis is a simple task and it can be easily performed
using classic linear algebra. Note that B is the number of reversible GFMs
in a convex basis and it represents the dimension of RMS. Interestingly,
if B20, then the ﬂux cone is pointed and the convex basis is unique
up to multiplication by non-negative numbers (Pfeiffer et (11., 1999).
However, genome-scale metabolic networks typically have B750. In the
extreme pathway approach (Schilling et (11., 2000), for example, the network
conﬁguration is modiﬁed to have B20.

2.3 Irreversible GFMs

The determination of irreversible GFMs is the actual challenge in computing
a convex basis. To illustrate how to calculate such a set, we will use the
concept of minimal metabolic behavior (MMB) introduced in Larhlimi and
Bockmayr (2009).

A metabolic behavior is any non-empty set of irreversible reactions able
to carry ﬂux together in a steady state ﬂux vector. A metabolic behavior D
is minimal if there is no proper subset of D with this property. For a more
rigorous deﬁnition of MMB, see Larhlimi and Bockmayr (2009).

According to Theorem 9 in Larhlimi and Bockmayr (2009), each
irreversible GFM in a convex basis involves a different MMB and therefore
the number of irreversible GFMs in a convex basis is equal to the number of
MMBs. We can then deﬁne the set of irreversible GFMs in a convex basis
as a subset of EFMs with the property that each EFM in this subset involves
a different MMB.

Observe that in non-pointed ﬂux cones we may have more than one EFM
involving a particular MMB. Indeed, for this reason we can have a non-
unique convex basis. However, in terms of determining a particular convex
basis, we only need to select one such EFM for each MMB. We here selected
the EFM with the minimum number of reversible reactions. The rest of
EFMs involving the same MMB (but not included in the convex basis) can
be generated by the EFM selected for the convex basis and the reversible
GFMs. More details on MMBs and GFMs can be found in Larhlimi and
Bockmayr (2009).

In this light, we propose a general optimization-based method to
enumerate MMBs and their associated GFMs. Our method starts from the
assumption that the ﬂux mode involving the minimum number of irreversible
reactions will involve the shortest MMB. By abuse of language, we here refer
to an EFM involving the shortest MMB with the minimal use of reversible
reactions as the shortest GFM. Accordingly, we ﬁrst deﬁne the constraints
and the objective function to be optimized that allows the calculation of
the shortest GFM. Based on this optimization model, we then show how
to calculate the K -shortest GFMs. Finally, extensions to other problems of
interest will be presented.

We mean here by l-shortest GFM, the EFM involving the minimum
number of irreversible reactions, i.e. the shortest MMB, with the minimal
use of reversible reactions; 2-shortest GFM, the EFM containing the second
shortest MMB with the minimal use of reversible reactions; K -shortest GFM,
the EFM containing the K -shortest MMB with the minimal use of reversible
reactions. Note that we may have multiple GFMs containing the same number
of irreversible reactions, i.e. MMBs with the same length. If this occurs, they
are counted separately with different K values.

2.3.] Shortest GFM Let z, be a binary variable associated with each
reaction r (r21, ...,R), where zr=1 if the reaction is active in the shortest
GFM, 0 otherwise. As noted above, v, represents the ﬂux variable for reaction
r. Equation (5) introduces the constraints needed to relate the reaction
variables z, and v,, where M is a large positive constant value, which
represents the bounds for the reaction ﬂuxes.

—Mz,§v,§Mzr, r=1,...,R (5)

Equations (6) and (7) deﬁne the thermodynamic and steady state
constraints, as introduced above.

In order to ensure that at least one irreversible reaction occurs in the
shortest GFM, we need Equation (8), which avoids the trivial solution, (v,=0,
r=1, ...,R).

Z v,Zl (8)

In order to calculate the shortest GFM, we pose the following objective

function:

W Z z.+ Z z. (9)

r21, rEIrr r21, rglrr

Minimize

which involves two terms to be minimized. The ﬁrst one is the number of
active irreversible reactions multiplied by a large positive constant value,
W; the second one is the number of active reversible reactions. We give W
times more weight to the sum of active irreversible reactions to guarantee that
the ﬂux mode involves the minimum number of irreversible reactions and,
therefore, the shortest MMB participates in the solution. The second term
guarantees that (i) the ﬂux mode containing the shortest MMB is elementary,
i.e. non-decomposable, as deﬁned for EFMs ; and (ii) the minimal use of
reversible reactions as deﬁned for the shortest GFM.

2.3.2 K -sh0rtest GF Ms Similarly to de Figueiredo et a1. (2009), we need
constraints to remove all the previous k-shortest GFMs (k=1, ...,K— 1) from
the set of solutions in order to calculate the K -shortest GFM. We already
know that the K—shortest GFM involves the K—shortest MMB. Since the
convex basis needs only one EFM for each MMB, we need to guarantee
that the K -shortest GFM does not involve the previous k-shortest MMBs
(k=1,...,K—1), but only the K—shortest MMB. To do this, let Z5 be the
binary solution associated with the k-shortest GFM (k=1, ...,K —1), where
Z521 if reaction r is active in the k-shortest GFM, 0 otherwise, and we
impose the following constraint:

R

R
Z zfzrs Z 25 —1, k=1,...,K—1 (10)

r21, rEIrr r21, rEIrr

where the term in the left-hand side of Equation (10) determines the number
of irreversible reactions in the new solution (Zr) that were active in the
k-shortest GFM (k=1, ...,K —1), and the right-hand side is the number of
irreversible reactions that were active in the k-shortest GFM (k=1, ...,K— 1)
less one. The inequality states that the number of irreversible reactions
repeating from the k-shortest GFM (k: 1, ...,K— 1) in the new solution should
be strictly smaller than the total number of active irreversible reactions in
the k-shortest GFM (k=1,...,K—1). In essence, Equation (10) ensures that,
once we solve our model, the k-shortest MMBs are prevented from appearing
again in the solution, for k: 1, ...,K— 1. This guarantees that the solution will
involve the K -shortest MMB, and therefore the K -shortest GFM is obtained.

2.3.3 Extensions to K -sh0rtest GFMs The procedure described above
can be applied (in theory) to enumerate a full set of irreversible GFMs
(gi, i=1, ...,G) for a given metabolic network. However, our optimization
method is not particularly efﬁcient in small-scale metabolic networks when
compared with classical methods. Indeed, the main advantage of our method
is the enumeration of a subset of GFMs (K :10 — 10000) in large metabolic
networks. In addition, the use of optimization allows the user to directly
analyze those subsets of GFMs that may be of interest, as in de Figueiredo
et a1. (2009). This makes our approach a suitable tool for exploring EFMs
(GFMs) in large metabolic networks.

To illustrate this, our method can be used to explore the K -shortest GFMs
that involve a particular reaction E of interest, namely by imposing their ﬂux
v; to be non-zero [ Equation (11)]. Note here that Y is a scalar coefﬁcient
(Y=—1 or Y=1), whose value decides the direction of the ﬂux of reaction E
in the case the reaction is reversible.

ngzl, Y=—10rY=1 (11)

The application of the K—shortest GFM method here, Equations (5)7
(10) plus Equation (11), requires to consider if reaction E is reversible or
irreversible. If the reaction is irreversible, then our method will calculate
a subset of irreversible GFMs containing this reaction (Y=1) . At the same
time, if the reaction is reversible but it is not involved in any reversible GFM,
i.e. a pseudo-irreversible reaction, as deﬁned in Larhlimi and Bockmayr
(2009), then our optimization method will produce GFMs containing this

reversible reaction. Note that Y can be —1 or +1 depending on the direction
we want irreversible GFMs to occur. On the other hand, if the reaction
is reversible and it participates in reversible GFMs, our current method
might fail. To overcome this issue, a possible strategy would be to split
this reversible reaction into two irreversible steps.

Note that we can only include one constraint based on Equation (11).
For example, if we apply constraint (11) to reactions S1 and S2, i.e. ﬁnding
solutions to our model that involve reactions S1 and S2, then we might obtain
solutions containing two EFMs, namely one using S1 and another using S2.
Therefore, the non-decomposability condition is not guaranteed. In addition,
as in de Figueiredo et a1. (2009), it is possible to deﬁne a growth medium.
Extracellular metabolites not included in the growth medium can only be
balanced/produced, but not consumed.

2.3.4 Implementation The mathematical optimization model given above
for computing the K -shortest irreversible GFMs, consisting of objective
function (9) subject to Equations (5)%8), plus elimination constraints
(10) and perhaps constraint (11), is a mixed-integer linear program.
Algorithmically, such programs are solved Via branch and bound and cutting
planes methods (Pardalos and Resende, 2002). Various free and commercial
software tools are available to perform this task. We used ILOG CPLEX®.

To reinforce the understanding of our method, Supplementary Material
details the application of our method to the (toy) metabolic network presented
in Larhlimi and Bockmayr (2009).

3 RESULTS

In this section, we present results corresponding to the application
of our K -shortest GFMs to analyze the pathway structure of E.c01i
to produce lysine. We used the genome-scale metabolic network
of E.c01i K-12 MG1665 (Feist et (11., 2007), which involves 2082
reactions and 1668 metabolites. As noted above, our method is
particularly useﬁil for networks of this size, since the computation of
a convex basis via traditional methods (Pfeiffer et (11., 1999; Terzer
and Stelling, 2008; Wagner and Urbanczik, 2005) is not applicable
in these networks.

A minimal medium based on glucose, ammonium and oxygen was
utilized. We neglected constraints from proton and cofactor (ATP,
NADH, NADPH, etc.) balances, ﬁxing them as external metabolites.
One may question the validity of this hypothesis for NADP and
NADPH, since NADPH is required in stoichiometric amounts for
lysine production and, as discussed in Wittmann and Becker (2007),
its supply has substantial impact in metabolism. In this work, for
the sake of simplicity, we focused on pathways for the supply of
the carbon backbone of lysine. Moreover, extending the current
work to consider the role of cofactors in lysine production can be
accomplished without loss of generality, as shown in de Figueiredo
et (11. (2009). See Supplementary Material for the exact deﬁnition of
the medium and cofactors set.

The reaction transporting lysine from the periplasm compartment
to the external compartment (LYStex, see Feist et (11., 2007) is
pseudo-irreversible, i.e. no reversible GFMs exist that produce
lysine. Thus, we need only to focus on irreversible GFMs producing
lysine. Our K -shortest GFMs method was then applied with K =100
and constraint (11) for lysine. We also computed the K—shortest
EFMs, as described in de Figueiredo et (11., 2009, in order to compare
the results. We selected M =100 to guarantee that no pathway
information is missed, similarly to de Figueiredo et (11. (2009). In a 64
Bits, 2.00GHz, 12GB RAM PC, CPLEX 12.1 took approximately
30 and 100 min to compute the 100 shortest EFMs and GFMs,

respectively. Therefore, though computation time is acceptable, our
method is less efﬁcient than the K -shortest EFMs method.

Note that, by setting cofactors as external metabolites, we may
ﬁnd solutions that use some cofactors as carbon source, which are
irrelevant for the biosynthesis of lysine using glucose as carbon
source. As it can be observed in the Supplementary Material, we
found this issue in longer pathways using AMP as carbon source.
To prevent these solutions from appearing, we constrained the
adenine pool formed by ATP, ADP and AMP to be in balance
by adding the following constraint to our previous formulation:

R R R _

Zrzl SATPrVr + Zrzl sADPrVr + Zr=1sAMPrVr—Os where SATPre
sADpr and sAMpr are the stoichiometric coefﬁcients of ATP, ADP
and AMP, respectively, for reaction r.

3.1 Comparison between K -shortest EFMs and GFMs

Figure 1 is an overview representation of the 100-shortest EFMs
and GFMs. It can be seen that the 100-shortest GFMs present
a more diverse and varied set of pathways than the 100-shortest
EFMs. This hypothesis is further conﬁrmed in Table 1. First, the
100 shortest EFMs and 100 shortest GFMs involve 54 and 132
reactions, respectively. In addition, while the maximum length for
100 shortest EFMs is 26, this is 37 for the 100 shortest GFMs,
which just indicates that the K -shortest GFMs method produce a set
of longer pathways. We also used the Hamming distance to evaluate
the differences between each pair of solutions of the 100 shortest
EFMs (GFMs), ﬁnding that the average Hamming distance is higher
for GFMs, which just indicates that the shortest EFMs approach
determine a less diverse set of solutions.

Furthermore, it can be observed from Table 1 that from 54
reactions that participate in the 100 shortest EFMs, 49 are included
in the 100 shortest GFMs. This implies that most information in the
shortest EFMs is included in the shortest GFMs and, therefore, the
GFMs approach is more informative. To validate this, we created
a subnetwork with the reactions forming the 100 shortest EFMs
and computed the ﬁill set of EFMs for this subnetwork via efmtool
(Terzer and Stelling, 2008). As observed in Table 1, we obtained
1665 EFMs, 1636 of which produce L—lysine. We did the same for the
100 shortest GFMs, ﬁnding 354 238 EFMs in total, 25 007 of which
produce L—lysine. The difference in the number of pathways is clearly
signiﬁcant. If the RMS is included in the subnetworks designed, the
difference is much more important, though efmtool was not capable
of calculating the number of EFMs for the subnetwork created with
the reactions participating in the 100 shortest GFMs plus RMS.

From the biochemical point of View, though difﬁcult to observe
in Figure 1 (see Supplementary Figs S2, S4 and S5 for a clearer
picture), different insights can be gained. The interpretation of
the network graphs in the Supplementary Material becomes easier
when we focus on pyruvate (pyr) and oxolacetate (oaa), since the
variability in the set of EFMs and GFMs is mainly related to the
production and use of those metabolites, mainly due to the fact that
they are the precursors of lysine.

Among the 100 shortest EFMs (see Supplementary Figs S2
and S5), the main difference is the degradation of glucose into
pyruvate. As we are producing shorter pathways, we obtain the
shortest routes to do this function, namely glycolysis, the Entner—
Doudoroff (ED) pathway, the methylglyoxal bypass and some
variations of these pathways such as a detour via dihydroxyacetone
(dha). Minor differences relate to the transportation of glucose into

cytosol, nitrogen metabolism, the balancing of succinate (succ) and
succinyl-CoA (succoa) and the production of dha.

With respect to the 100 shortest GFMs, we have longer routes
than the 100 shortest EFMs, though they are still short (maximum
37 reactions). The set of pathways is now much more varied (see
Supplementary Figs S4 and S5). For instance, the pentose phosphate
(PP) pathway and the glyoxylate shunt are now recovered. Moreover,
we obtain several routes around the switch node per-pyr-oaa, which
is known to be responsible for the distribution of the carbon ﬂux
among catabolism, anabolism and energy supply in several bacteria
(Sauer and Eikmanns, 2005). Overall, most of previous biochemical
knowledge on the production of lysine is recovered in the 100
shortest GFMs.

A relevant mechanism appearing in the 100 shortest GFMs is
the metabolic cycle shown in Figure 2a, which suggests a novel

pathway to produce lysine. This metabolic cycle consumes one
molecule of oaa and produces one molecule of pyr and co2 each,
making a detour through propionyl-CoA (ppcoa). This cycle is an
alternative mechanism to the OAADC reaction: oaa —> pyr + co2.
However, it is less efﬁcient than the OAADC reaction, since it
involves six reactions and consumes one molecule of ATP to carry
out the conversion. We refer to it as the ppcoa cycle. To the best of
our knowledge, this cycle has not been previously described. Note
here that other routes for the conversion of oaa to pyr have been
previously described in the literature (Wittmann and Becker, 2007).

The importance of the ppcoa cycle in the production of lysine
is however questionable. The decarboxylation of oaa is generally
counterproductive, since the overexpression of genes associated
with enzymes producing oaa as well as the deletion of genes
encoding enzymes that withdraw oaa are well-known strategies
to increase the yield of lysine (Wittmann and Becker, 2007). A
counterexample here is the decarboxylation of oaa via malate
(reactions MDH and ME2) that converts NADH into NADPH,
which, as mentioned above, is important for lysine production. On
the other hand, it is known from studies in Aspergillus nidulans that
ppcoa inhibits the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and thus, its
presence decreases the ﬂux through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle (Brock and Buckel, 2004). This may be of interest for lysine
production, since the increase in the yield of lysine is linked to a
decrease in the ﬂux through TCA (Kiss and Stephanopoulos, 1992).
The overall effect requires experimental validation. We discuss
below the ﬁinctional feasibility of this cycle in E.c01i.

3.2 Physiological feasibility of ppcoa cycle in E.coli

As observed in Figure 2a, the ppcoa cycle comprises a route linking
succinyl-CoA (succoa) to propionyl-CoA (ppcoa), which is part of

the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway, and a route linking propionyl-
CoA to pyruvate accompanied by a reduction of oxaloacetate to
succinate (succ), as a part of the 2-methylcitric acid cycle. These two
routes are joined by succinyl-CoA synthetase, which belongs to the
TCA cycle. We describe below the feasibility of the coexistence of
the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway and the 2-methylcitric acid cycle
in E.c01i.

The unidirectional 2-methylcitric acid cycle has been shown to
be essential for propionyl-CoA degradation in several bacteria and
ﬁingi and an impairment of the cycle prohibits growth on propionate,
odd chain fatty acids and propionyl-CoA generating amino acids
(Brock and Buckel, 2004).

An alternative pathway for propionyl-CoA degradation is the
coenzyme Bl2-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA pathway, which is
also operative in the direction of propionyl-CoA formation (Buckel
et al., 2005; Michenfelder et al., 1987). Despite a ﬁinctional
2-methylcitric acid cycle in E.coli, genes encoding proteins of
the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway were recently discovered in this
organism (Froese et al., 2009; Haller et al., 2000). Although the
contribution of the latter pathway to propionyl-CoA degradation
is unknown, all genes encode ﬁinctional enzymes as shown by
heterologous integration of the pathway for secondary metabolite
production in Salmonella enterica serovar thyphimurium (Aldor
et al., 2002) and polypetide production in E. coli (Aldor et al., 2002).

Assuming a coexistence of both pathways, they can be integrated
into the central carbon metabolism. Thus, we conducted additional
simulations to examine this hypothesis, which resulted in novel
potential pathways linking glycolysis and TCA cycle. Results are
given in the Supplementary Material.

Besides the general functionality of proteins involved in
the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway, an important aspect of the
methylmalonyl-CoA pathway not reﬂected in the genome-scale

network of E.coli refers to the fact that the methylmalonyl-CoA
mutase (MMM2) requires 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (adocbl) as
prosthetic group (cf. (Banerjee, 1997; Ludwig and Matthews, 1997).
Detailed reaction mechanisms, as in Figure 2b for MMM2, are
not usually included in genome-scale networks. In particular, when
a cofactor is essential for cell growth, which is not the case for
adobcl, constraint-based methods, such as ﬂux balanced analysis
(FBA), include its consumption in the biomass equation to simulate
its requirement (Feist et al., 2007, 2009). In contrast, in metabolic
pathway analysis the biomass equation is not typically included and,
consequently, these interactions are not taken into account. To deal
with this issue in metabolic pathway analysis, a possible strategy is
to create an additional layer of logical interactions containing the
interdependency between prosthetic groups and enzymes, reﬂecting
that if a given cofactor cannot be de novo synthesized (which can
be tested with EFM analysis or FBA) and it is not supplied in the
growth medium, then the reaction requiring such cofactor cannot
take place.

4 CONCLUSION

In this article, we have presented a novel theoretical method to
compute a convex basis based on the recent work of de Figueiredo
et al. (2009) and Larhlimi and Bockmayr (2009). Our method was
effectively applied to determine a subset of GFMs in large metabolic
networks, where classical approaches fail. Though the computation
of K -shortest GFMs is more expensive than the K -shortest EFMs
method presented in de Figueiredo et al. (2009), we here obtained
a more diverse and informative set of pathways.

In the analysis of pathways producing lysine obtained by the
K -shortest GFMs method, we identiﬁed a new cycle via propionyl-
CoA that produces one molecule of pyruvate and consumes one

molecule of oxaloacetate. This cycle integrates part of two metabolic
pathways that have an important biotechnological application.
Experimental validation of the cycle is needed to examine its
ﬁinctional feasibility and biotechnological impact, but it shows
the potential of our K—shortest GFMs method in predicting novel
metabolic pathways and generating hypotheses.

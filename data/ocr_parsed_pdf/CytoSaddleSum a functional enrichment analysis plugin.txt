ABSTRACT

Summary: CytoSaddleSum provides Cytoscape users with access
to the functionality of SaddleSum, a functional enrichment tool based
on sum-of-weight scores. It operates by querying SaddleSum locally
(using the standalone version) or remotely (through an H'I'I'P request
to a web server). The functional enrichment results are shown as a
term relationship network, where nodes represent terms and edges
show term relationships. Furthermore, query results are written as
Cytoscape attributes allowing easy saving, retrieval and integration
into network-based data analysis workflows.

1 INTRODUCTION

CytoSaddleSum is a Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011) plugin to access
the functionality of SaddleSum, an enrichment analysis tool based
on sum-of-weights-score (Stojmirovic and Yu, 2010). Unlike most
other enrichment tools, SaddleSum does not require users to directly
select signiﬁcant genes or perform extensive simulations to compute
statistics. Instead, it uses weights derived from measurements, such
as log expression ratios, to produce a score for each database term.
It then estimates, depending on the number of genes involved,
the P-value for that score by using the saddlepoint approximation
(Lugannani and Rice, 1980) to the empirical distribution function
derived from all weights. This approach was shown (Stojmirovic
and Yu, 2010) to yield accurate P-values and internally consistent
retrievals.

As a popular and ﬂexible platform for visualization, integration
and analysis of network data, Cytoscape allows gene expression
data import and hosts numerous plugins for functional enrichment
analysis. However, none of these plugins are based on the ‘gene set
analysis approach’ that takes into account gene weights. Therefore,
to ﬁll this gap, we have developed CytoSaddleSum, a Cytoscape
interface to SaddleSum. To enable several desirable features of
CytoSaddleSum, however, we had to signiﬁcantly extend the original
SaddleSum code (see descriptions below).

2 IMPLEMENTATION

While CytoSaddleSum is implemented in Java using Cytoscape API,
it functions by running either locally or remotely a separate instance
of SaddleSum, written in C. In either mode, CytoSaddleSum takes
the user input through a graphical user interface, validates it, and
passes a query to SaddleSum. Upon receiving the entire query results,
CytoSaddleSum stores them as the node and network attributes of
the newly created term relationship graph. Consequently, the query
output can be edited or manipulated within Cytoscape. Furthermore,
saving term graph through Cytoscape also preserves the results for
later use.

The most important extension to SaddleSum involved
construction of extended term databases (ETDs). Each ETD
contains the mappings of genes to Gene Ontology (Gene Ontology
Consortium, 2010) terms and KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2008)
pathways, as well as an abbreviated version of the NCBI Gene
(Maglott et al., 201 1) database for all genes mapped to terms. Thanks
to the latter, when using an ETD, SaddleSum is able to interpret the
provided gene labels as NCBI Gene IDs, as gene symbols and as
gene aliases. Each ETD also contains relations among terms that
are used by SaddleSum for term graph construction.

3 USAGE

CytoSaddleSum operates on the currently selected Cytoscape
network whose nodes represent genes or gene products. The
queries are submitted through the query form embedded as a
tab into the Cytoscape Control Panel, on the left of the screen.
The selected network must contain at least one node mapped to
a ﬂoating-point Cytoscape attribute, which would provide node
weights. CytoSaddleSum considers only the selected nodes within
the network. The user can select the weight attribute through a
dropdown box on the query form. Any selected node without
speciﬁed weight is assumed to have weight 0. The user-settable
cannonicalName attribute, automatically created by Cytoscape for
each network node, serves as the gene label.

After selecting the network and the nodes within it, the user needs
to select a term database and set the statistical and weight processing
parameters. The latter enable users to transform the supplied weights
within SaddleSum. This includes changing the sign of the weights,
as well as applying a cutoff, by weight or by rank. All weights below
the cutoff are set to 0. The statistical parameters are E-value cutoff,
minimum term size, effective database size and statistical method.
We deﬁne the effective database size as the number of terms in
the term database that map to at least k genes among the selected
nodes, where k is the minimum term size. Apart from the default

Fig. 1. CytoSaddleSum user interface consists of the query form (left), the results panel (right) and the term relationship network (center), which here partially
covers the original network. The results stored as attributes of the term network can be edited through Cytoscape Data Panel.

‘Lugannani-Rice’ statistics, it is also possible to select ‘One-sided
Fisher’s Exact test’ statistics, which are based on the hypergeometric
distribution. In that case, the user must select a cutoff under the
weight processing parameters.

To run local queries, a user needs the command-line version of
SaddleSum and the term databases, both available for download
from our website, and install them on the same machine that runs
Cytoscape. The advantages of running local queries include speed,
independence of Internet connection and support of queries to
custom databases in the GMT ﬁle format used by the GSEA tool
(Subramanian et al., 2005). Furthermore, the stand-alone program
can be used outside of Cytoscape for large sets of queries. On
the other hand, running remote queries require no installation of
additional software, since queries are passed to the SaddleSum server
over an HTTP connection. The disadvantage of running remote
queries is that it can take much longer to run and that the choice of
term databases is restricted to ETDs available only for some model
organisms.

CytoSaddleSum also displays warning or error messages reported
by SaddleSum. For example, when a provided gene label is
ambiguous, depending on whether the ambiguity could be resolved,
CytoSaddleSum will relay a warning or an error message reported
by SaddleSum. CytoSaddleSum presents query results as a term
relationship network (Fig. 1), consisting of signiﬁcant terms or
their ancestors linked by hierarchical relations available in the term
database. The statistical signiﬁcance of each term is indicated by
the color of its corresponding node. To facilitate browsing of the
results, CytoSaddleSum generates a set of summary tables, which
contain the lists of signiﬁcant terms and various details about the

query. These summary tables are embedded into Cytoscape Results
Panel, on the right of the screen. Clicking on a signiﬁcant term in a
summary table will select that term in the term relationship network
and select all nodes mapping to it in the original network. The results
can be exported as text or tab-delimited ﬁles and can be restored
from tab-delimited ﬁles through the Export and Import menus of
Cytoscape. Detailed instructions, explanations and examples can be
found in SaddleSum manual (Supplementary Material).

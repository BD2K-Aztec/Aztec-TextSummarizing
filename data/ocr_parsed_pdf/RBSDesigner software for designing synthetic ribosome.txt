ABSTRACT

Motivation: RBSDesigner predicts the translation efficiency of
existing mRNA sequences and designs synthetic ribosome binding
sites (RBSs) for a given coding sequence (ODS) to yield a
desired level of protein expression. The program implements the
mathematical model for translation initiation described in Na et al.
(Mathematical modeling of translation initiation for the estimation
of its efficiency to computationally design mRNA sequences with a
desired expression level in prokaryotes. BMC Syst. Biol., 4, 71). The
program additionally incorporates the effect on translation efficiency
of the spacer length between a Shine—Dalgarno (SD) sequence and
an AUG codon, which is crucial for the incorporation of fMet-tRNA
into the ribosome. RBSDesigner provides a graphical user interface
(GUI) for the convenient design of synthetic RBSs.

Availability: RBSDesigner is written in Python and Microsoft Visual
Basic 6.0 and is publicly available as precompiled stand-alone
software on the web (http://rbs.kaist.ac.kr).

1 BACKGROUND

Controlling protein expression levels is a major challenge in several
areas of biology. It ensures the robust operation of synthetic circuits
in synthetic biology, enables high levels of production of therapeutic
proteins in biotechnology, and optimizes the ﬂux of metabolic
pathways in metabolic engineering (Na et al., 2010a).

Over several decades, biochemical studies have unraveled the
mechanisms underlying transcription in prokaryotes, and these
mechanisms have enabled the control of gene expression. However,
a few nucleotide changes in the untranslated region of an mRNA
can also introduce drastic changes in protein expression levels.
Recent studies have shown that protein expression relies heavily on
translation, speciﬁcally during initiation. In one study, changes in
nucleotides around the start codon downstream of a given promoter
altered protein expression levels by a factor of 250 (De Smit and
Van Duin, 1990). One mechanism underlying the sensitivity of
expression is that the efﬁciency with which RBSs recruit ribosomes

for translation initiation depends on several factors, including the
Shine—Dalgarno (SD) sequence and the secondary structures of
nucleotides within the RBS (Makrides, 1996).

The secondary structure of a transcript is context dependent, and
variations in a few nucleotides within the RBS can modify the
energetics of interactions with neighboring nucleotides. Interactions
between the 16S rRNA in the ribosome and a transcript can also
inﬂuence the interactions at the translation initiation site. The
complexity of the sequence-dependent structural interactions has led
many researchers to adopt ad hoc experimental methods to optimize
each expression problem (Zhelyabovskaya et al., 2004).

Recently, we constructed a mathematical translation initiation
model that combines techniques for estimating translation efﬁciency
(Na et al., 2010b). The mathematical model includes the following
events in the model for translation initiation: (i) global folding and
unfolding of transcribed mRNAs; (ii) regional folding and unfolding
of nucleotides in an RBS; and (iii) ribosome binding mediated by
SD regions and 16S rRNA. The translation efﬁciency is proportional
to the ratio of ribosome-bound mRNA to free mRNA.

A thermodynamic model similar to the one employed here has
been reported, which estimates the translation efﬁciency (Salis et al.,
2009). A web-based tool (RBSCalculator) was developed as a user
front-end for this model. The predictive value of this model and our
model is similar because the same key factors are considered, but
the incorporation of additional factors into our model distinguishes
RBSDesigner from RBSCalculator. For example, RB SDesigner can
predict the translation efﬁciency of mRNA sequences that may
potentially fold into two or more structures.

In the present work, we developed a GUI tool that facilitates
the design of synthetic RBS exhibiting a desired level of protein
expression. This technique may assist advances in a variety of
biological ﬁelds, including synthetic biology, protein biotechnology
and metabolic engineering, in which protein expression control is
of key importance.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The mathematical routines were written in Python (http://
www.python.org) and compiled as an executable using py2exe
(http://www.py2exe.org). This program identiﬁes a potential SD
sequence and RES in a user-speciﬁed sequence and extracts
secondary structure information for the mRNA as predicted by
UNAfold v3.3 (Markham and Zuker, 2008). The effect of spacer
length between the SD and AUG sequences on translation efﬁciency
was considered because this spacer length inﬂuences the efﬁciency
with which ﬂVIet-tRNAs are incorporated into the ribosome during

initiation of translation elongation (Ringquist et al., 2006). Several
sources of information were used to parameterize the translation
efﬁciency. A GUI was constructed using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0
to mediate the interaction of a user with the numerical expressions
of the program. Thus, RBSDesigner provides a convenient way
for biologists to design synthetic RBS for the control of protein
expression.

3 KEY FEATURES

3.1 Translation efﬁciency estimation

RB SDesigner estimates the translation efﬁciency of a user-speciﬁed
mRNA sequence. The GUI displays the predicted properties, such
as the identity of a potential SD sequence, the SD—ribosome binding
energy, the identity of a potential RBS sequence, the probability that
the structure of the RBS is unfolded and the effect of spacer length,
among other properties (Fig. 1A).

3.2 Synthetic RBS design

RB SDesigner designs synthetic RBS. More speciﬁcally, it can
design the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between SD and AUG
sequences such that a desired level of protein expression is achieved,
as predicted by the genetic algorithm (Fig. 1B).

4 CONCLUSIONS

The availability of convenient software that facilitates the design
of synthetic RBS for controlling protein expression is critical for
the advancement of synthetic biology, protein biotechnology and
metabolic engineering. RB SDesigner provides an intuitive and easy
way to design synthetic RBS. The synthetic RBS could be used
to maximize translation efﬁciency for the intensive production of
therapeutics or industrial proteins. It may assist in balancing the
levels of enzymes in a synthetic metabolic pathway to optimize the

metabolic ﬂux, or it could be used to optimize protein expression
of components in constructed genetic circuits to ensure robust
operation.

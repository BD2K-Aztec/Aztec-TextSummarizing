Abstract

Motivation: Identification of microRNA (miRNA) transcriptional start sites (TSSs) is crucial to
understand the transcriptional regulation of miRNA. As miRNA expression is highly cell specific,
an automatic and systematic method that could identify miRNA TSSs accurately and cell specific—
ally is in urgent requirement.

Results: A workflow to identify the TSSs of miRNAs was built by integrating the data of H3K4me3
and DNase I hypersensitive sites as well as combining the conservation level and sequence fea—
ture. By applying the workflow to the data for 54 cell lines from the ENCODE project, we success—
fully identified TSSs for 663 intragenic miRNAs and 620 intergenic miRNAs, which cover 84.2%
(1283/1523) of all miRNAs recorded in miRBase 18. For these cell lines, we found 4042 alternative
TSSs for intragenic miRNAs and 3186 alternative TSSs for intergenic miRNAs. Our method
achieved a better performance than the previous non—cell—specific methods on miRNA TSSs.
The cell—specific method developed by Georgakilas et al. gives 158 TSSs of higher accuracy
in two cell lines, benefitting from the employment of deep—sequencing technique. In contrast,
our method provided a much higher number of miRNA TSSs (7228) for a broader range of
cell lines without the limitation of costly deep—sequencing data, thus being more applicable
for various experimental cases. Analysis showed that upstream promoters at—2 kb to—200 bp
of TSS are more conserved for independently transcribed miRNAs, while for miRNAs
transcribed with host genes, their core promoters (—200 bp to 200 bp of TSS) are significantly
conserved.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 nt), non—coding RNAs that genesis (Gama—Carvalho et al., 2014; He et al., 2007; Hermeking,

negatively regulates gene expression by binding to the 3’—untranslated 2010; Lee and Dutta, 2007). To understand the underlying mechan—
region of mRNAs. Studies so far have revealed that miRNAs are ism of the miRNA—mediated regulatory pathways, it is important to
involved in almost all the key biological processes, such as know where the miRNAs are produced from in the genome and

which genes they are targeting. While the latter aspect has been in—
tensely studied for both animals and plants system in the recent years
(Betel et al., 2010; Friedman et al., 2009; Hsu et al., 2014; Wang and
El Naqa, 2008), the picture of transcription of miRNAs is far from
complete, especially for the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of
miRNAs.

In general, miRNA genes are firstly transcribed into primary
miRNAs (pri—miRNAs) by RNA polymerase (Pol) II or III in nucleus
(Borchert et al., 2006; Cai et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2004). Then, the
RNase Drosha processes pri—miRNAs into precursor miRNAs (pre—
miRNAs) (Han et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2003, 2006), which later are
exported into the cytosol and turn to mature miRNAs with the help
of Dicer (Lee et al., 2002). The process of miRNA transcription is
basically the same as that of protein—coding genes; however, both 5’—
and 3’—ends of pri—miRNA are subject to quick degradation. The
full—length transcript of a miRNA gene is very difficult to be retained
(Chen and Shyu, 2011; Houseley et al., 2006). Therefore, it is hard
to accurately locate the TSS of miRNA.

The database miRT collected predicted miRNA TSSs from dif—
ferent sources (Bhattacharyya et al., 2012) and proved helpful for
experimental validation (Hurst et al., 2014). The methods of the
identification of miRNA TSSs available so far are mainly based on
the cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE), RNA polymerase II
(Pol II) data or histone modification data. For example, CAGE tags
(Kodzius et al., 2006) were used to identify miRNA TSSs by con—
sidering its possibility to capture the 5’ cap (Chien et al., 2011;
Marsico et al., 2013; Saini et al., 2008). However, the rapid process—
ing of the primary miRNA transcript by Drosha produces uncapped
pre—miRNAs that cannot be captured by CAGE technology. Wang
et al. (2010) predicted miRNA TSSs by modeling the RNA Pol II
binding patterns. Corcoran et al. (2009) developed a method to pre—
dict the core promoters of miRNAs with Support Vector Machine
models based on RNA Pol II data. More methods were developed by
integrating the histone modification data. Ozsolak et al. (2008)
identified miRNA TSSs by combining the information of RNA Pol
II, H3K4me3 and H3K9/14A data. However, these studies were lim—
ited to small amount of miRNAs due to the insufficiency of Pol II
data and ignored the case of Poly III transcription in one aspect. In
further aspect, they discarded the cell—specific information of
miRNA TSSs by pooling the Pol II data from experiments.

Annotating the cell—specific information of miRNA TSSs is im—
portant because it has been proved that miRNA is of higher tissue
specificity than protein—coding genes (Kawaji et al., 2009; Roux
et al., 2012). Most recently, Georgios et al. developed an algorithm
‘microTSS’ for integrating RNA—Sequencing data with H3K4me3,
Pol II and DNase—seq data to identify the tissue—specific TSSs of
intergenic miRNAs in high resolution (Georgakilas et al., 2014). To
overcome the effect of Drosha processing and capture the pri—
miRNAs of low abundance, microTSS required high deep sequenc—
ing data which seems not easy to obtain for the large number of cell
lines and various cellular environmental conditions. So far, miRNA
TSSs of very few cell lines have been predicted in a cell—specific way.
An automatic and systematic method that could identify miRNA
TSSs accurately and cell specifically in a broad range of cell lines is
still in urgent requirement.

Here, we developed a workﬂow to identify miRNA TSSs in 54
cell lines based on H3K4me3 and DNase I—hypersensitive sites
(DHSs), which combined the features of species conservation and se—
quences. The proximal H3K4me3 region to each pre—miRNA in
each cell line is considered as the potential region containing the TSS
of the miRNA. DHSs are potential transcription factor binding sites,
and their existence of them in the promoter region can assure the

function of the identified TSSs. The accuracy of our predicted
miRNA TSSs is verified in several ways, including comparing the re—
sults with the miRNA TSSs that are identified by previous studies,
showing expressed sequence tag (EST) evidence for them and ana—
lyzing their global conservation. Known CAGE tags (Kawaji et al.,
2009, 2011) showed a higher signal at the TSSs that were identified
using our approach; however, the signal levels were not comparable
with those of protein—coding genes, which indicates the effect of the
rapid degradation of the 5’ cap of miRNA transcript and proves the
previous viewpoint that CAGE data is inadequate for the prediction
of miRNA TSSs. Current models of miRNA biogenesis were also
confirmed by our finding that the CAGE signal detected in nucleus
at the identified miRNA TSSs was much higher than that detected in
cytosol, whereas the nuclear and cytosolic CAGE signals for pro—
tein—coding genes are comparable. In addition, the analysis on the
predicted TSSs showed the promoters upstream the independent
TSSs of either intragenic or intergenic miRNAs are more conserved
than that of the host gene TSSs by which some intragenic miRNAs
are transcribed. In cases that miRNAs were broadly activated in
various cell lines, alternative TSSs and promoters were used in dif—
ferent cell lines. Then they could be regulated in a promoter—specific
manner.

2 Methods

2.1 Human miRNAs and Ensembl—annotated genes

A total of 1523 human miRNAs, including 821 intergenic miRNAs
and 702 intragenic miRNAs, were collected from miRBase release
18 (Kozomara and Griffiths—Jones, 2011). In total, 44 762 Ensembl—
annotated genes in hg19 were included in this research and were
derived from Ensembl through BioMart.

2.2 Cell—specific H3K4me3 modifications
As known from previous reports, H3K4me3 modification marks
transcription initiation sites in chromatin (Guenther et al., 2007).
Using these sites to identify miRNA TSSs can avoid the problem of
rapid pri—miRNA processing. We collected data for 54 cell lines
from the UCSC track ‘UW Histone’. These data are a part of the
ENCODE project and were generated by ChIP—seq high—throughput
sequencing. Overall, we obtained 401 05 8 peak tags and merged
those tags that were less than 250 bp apart. The tags were merged
based on the intrinsic feature of the data by observing that the inter—
val distance between tags was most likely to be smaller than 250 bp,
and this distance was also similar to the length of one nucleosome.
So tags less than 250 bp apart may be from the same nucleosome.
The DNA sequences of these tags, including ﬂanking regions
from 200 bp upstream to 100 bp downstream, were downloaded
from the human genome (GRCh37/hg19) and were considered to be
regions that comprised real TSSs. The ﬂanking regions allowed us to
predict in a broader peak but did not affect our result very much.

2.3 Conservation score

The conservation score of each genomic position was scored from 0
to 1 based on the data derived from UCSC track ‘Mammal Cons
(phastCons46wayPlacental)’. This track shows multiple alignments
across 46 placental mammalian species based on the phastCons
method (Pollard et al., 2010; Siepel et al., 2005).

2.4 DNase l—hypersensitive sites
A DHS is a chromatin—accessible region in the genome that marks
regulatory regions of DNA. We collected data for 54 cell lines from

9103 ‘Og JSanV 110 seleﬁuv soc] ‘Btulomcg JO AJtSJQAtuf] 112 /310'S[BIIJDO[pJOJXO"SOIJBHIJOJIIIOICI/ﬂdnq 11101} pQPBOIIIAAOG

the UCSC track ‘UW Histone’. On average, 98.5% of ENCODE
ChIP—seq regions overlapped with DHSs (Bernstein et al., 2012). We
used these data to ensure the function of miRNA TSSs, resulting in
more reliable annotation of TSSs.

2.5 Determination of miRNA TSS

To combine different sources of data, the following formula was
introduced to determine miRNA TSS:

S,- : H3K4me3,- * DHS,- * max(CONS(X,-) + EPO(X,-)) (1)

This formula is a generalization of our workﬂow for predicting
the candidate TSSs. X,- denotes a predicted site for a miRNA in a
cell line. H3K4me3,-: 1, if X,- lies in the nearest H3K4me3 region
or 0 otherwise. H3K4me3 is a good marker for TSSs of protein
coding genes, so H3K4me3,- ensures the satisfied X,- must locate in
an H3K4me3 region. DHS,-: 1, if there exists any DHS on the up—
stream of X,-, or 0 otherwise. DHS,- ensures the satisfied X,- must
have some potential regulatory elements in its upstream sequences.
CONS denotes the conservation score of X,; EPO denotes the
Eponine (Down and Hubbard, 2002) score of X, Conservation is
closely related with functional importance and Eponine score is an
evaluation for TSS sequence feature. By selecting the X,- of max(S,-),
we integrated all these features related with TSS together and iden—
tified the candidate TSS for a miRNA. The identified TSS should
meet S,- > 0.

2.6 Collection of validated TSSs

We searched the literature to collect TSSs of miRNAs that were ex—
perimentally validated as benchmark data. These TSSs were verified
using different methods, such as retrieving complete reverse tran—
scription polymerase chain reaction transcripts by inhibiting Drosha
(Cai et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2007; Chien et al., 2011; Fukao
et al., 2007; Ribas et al., 2012; Taganov et al., 2006), validating the
activity of promoters by a luciferase reporter system (Cai et al.,
2004; Chang et al., 2007; Chien et al., 2011; Fukao et al., 2007; Lee
et al., 2004; Ozsolak et al., 2008) or annotating a transcript as it
was transcribed from its host gene (Kluiver et al., 2005). Genomic
coordinates of the validated TSSs in the human genome were col—
lected from the literature, and then all coordinates were converted
to hg19 by ‘liftover’ tools available on UCSC genome browser
(Supplementary File S1). Ultimately, this benchmark data contained
17 validated TSSs of 25 miRNAs.

2.7 Cell—specific validated TSSs in human

embryonic stem cell

Cell—specific validated TSSs in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)
have been derived from microTSS (Georgakilas et al., 2014).
Totally, validated TSSs of 67 miRNAs in miRBase 18 were listed in
Supplementary Table S2 in Supplementary File S2 and all the coord—
inates were based on hg19 genome assembly.

2.8 EST data

An EST is a short sub—sequence of a gene transcript, thus it repre—
sents a portion of an expressed gene. If the predicted primary
miRNAs were indeed transcribed, there should be ESTs derived
from them. In this study, all human ESTs in GeneBank (Benson
et al., 2013) were downloaded from UCSC, including 8 685 808
records.

3. Results

3.1 Workflow chart for the cell—specific

identification of miRNA TSSs

Here, we developed a workﬂow (see Supplementary Fig. S1 in
Supplementary File S2) to identify the miRNA TSSs in a cell—specific
way. First, we selected those H3K4me3 regions that were proximal
to each pre—miRNA in each cell line. For each H3K4me3 region, we
considered the score calculated by Eponine (Down and Hubbard,
2002), which can evaluate the similarity of the sequence signal to
the environment of a TSS and the conservation score. By employing
Eponine, we obtained several predicted sites with an Eponine score
in one region. To consider the conservation, we used the phastCons
score to calculate the conservation of each site that was predicted by
Eponine. To combine the sequence features with conservation, we
sorted the Eponine and phastCons scores in descending order and
then selected those sites with the minimal sum of these two ranks as
putative TSSs. To assure the function of these putative TSSs, we also
checked the regions 1 kb upstream of the miRNA TSSs using cell—
specific DHS data. The promoter of 1 kb region was selected in a
very strict way, because most transcription factor binding sites are
within 1 kb region (Hurst et al., 2014). Generalized as Equation (1),
we integrated H3K4me3 and DHS data with the score of conserva—
tion and promoter sequence features and obtained candidate TSSs.

We subsequently dealt with these candidate TSSs differently
based on the genomic context of the respective miRNA. For the can—
didate TSSs of intragenic miRNAs, the TSS of its host gene was ana—
lyzed. If the distance between the candidate TSS and the host—gene
TSS is small enough (i.e. less than a certain threshold), it is con—
sidered that the candidate TSS and the host—gene TSS are identical,
and the host gene TSS is taken as the candidate TSS. Here the thresh—
old is set as 150 bp, because the general length of H3K4me3 peaks
in our data is N150 bp and the TSSs within a same peak region
could be identical one. In the case that there was no candidate TSSs
close to the host gene TSS, we checked whether there were candidate
TSSs located between the host gene TSS and the pre—miRNA. If it
was, the candidate TSS was selected as the independent TSS of the
miRNA; if not, no TSS was predicted for the miRNA. For the candi—
date TSS of an intergenic miRNA, we checked whether any
Ensembl—annotated genes were present between the candidate TSS
and pre—miRNA. If there was an Ensembl—annotated gene, the candi—
date TSS might be the TSS of another transcript and was therefore
discarded.

After these two processes, our workﬂow yielded the TSSs of
miRNAs with 1 bp resolution in a cell—specific manner. Therefore,
for each miRNA in specific cell line, there are three possible types of
TSSs, i.e. the independent TSS for intergenic miRNA, the independ—
ent for intragenic miRNA and the host—gene TSS for intragenic
miRNA.

3.2 Evaluation of identified TSSs

3.2.1 Comparisons with collection of validated TSSs

We collected 25 experimentally verified TSSs (see Supplementary
Table S1 in Supplementary File S2) as benchmark data and com—
pared our prediction with other predictions. In the case there were
multiple predictions for one miRNA, we selected the best prediction
which is the closest one to the validated TSS. If we consider predic—
tions located closer than 1 kb from the validated TSSs as true posi—
tives (TPs) and the others as false positives, then we can compare the
sensitivity and precision among different methods. Sensitivity is
defined as TPs/ (all validated TSSs), and precision is defined as TPs/
(TPs + false positives). Since this comparison is non—cell specific, we

excluded the cell—specific method of Georgakilas et al. (2014). Our
method achieved 84%/91.3% in sensitivity and precision. Marsico
et al. (2013) achieved 88%/88%, Chien et al. (2011) achieved 28%/
46.7% and Marson et al. (2008) achieved 36%/39.1% in sensitivity
and precision. Apparently, our method performs better than Chien’s
and Marson’s work. However, comparing with Marsico’s method,
our approach was superior with regard to precision, whereas
Marsico et al. (2013) performed better in sensitivity.

3.2.2 Comparison with validated TSSs in hESC

To evaluate the accuracy of predicted cell—specific TSSs, we used 67
experimentally validated TSSs in hESC (Georgakilas et al., 2014) as
benchmark data and compared our predictions with other methods.
Since PROmiRNA (Marsico et al., 2013) provide multiple predictions
for one miRNA, we selected the prediction with the highest score and
took it into comparison. As shown in Supplementary Table S2 in
Supplementary File S2, we highlighted the correct predictions of five
works which are closer than 1 kb from validated TSSs.

By considering predictions located closer than 1 kb from the vali—
dated TSSs as TPs, we also calculated the sensitivity and precision
for each method. Our method achieved 55.2%/77.1% in sensitivity
and precision. Georgakilas et al. (2014) achieved 94.0%/97.0%,
Marsico et al. (2013) achieved 52.2%/53.8%, Chien et al. (2011)
achieved 13.4%/31.0% and Marson et al. (2008) achieved 16.4%/
40.7% in sensitivity and precision. For Marsico et al., Chien et al.
and Marson et al., these non—cell—specific methods showed their
disadvantage in performance and were incapable of predicting cell—
specific TSSs. Our method showed a better performance than those
non—cell—specific methods in both sensitivity and precision.
Georgakilas et al. (2014) outperforms all the other methods in this
cell—specific comparison. The main reason is that they integrated the
high—quality RNA deep—sequencing data with DNase—Seq/Digital
Genomic Footprinting (DGF), H3K4me3 and Pol II ChIP—Seq data.
The high—quality sequencing data provide a 10 times (N200 million
reads) higher resolution than the normal RNA sequencing data
(~20 million reads), which apparently benefits the accuracy of
Georgakilas’s prediction a lot. However, such deep—sequencing data
are costly and rare at present, which limits the application of
Georgakilas’s method. Our method, without requiring such expen—
sive sequencing data, can give more resourceful miRNA TSSs for a
broad range of cell lines. The sensitivity of our prediction is rela—
tively low (55.2%), but the precision is acceptable (77.1% ).

3.2.3 EST support for identified pri-miRNAs and TSSs

As shown in previous comparisons, the number of experimentally
validated TSSs is quite limited. To evaluate predictions in a general
way, ESTs were used as support. First, we mapped ESTs to the pre—
dicted pri—miRNA genes, which were defined as the genomic regions
from an identified TSS to the end of a pre—miRNA. We calculated
the number of ESTs which could overlap with identified

pri—miRNAs. It was found that 133/221 ESTs were averagely
mapped on each intergenic/intragenic miRNA. In the comparison
with other methods (Table 1), all the results showed the same order
of magnitude for the number of ESTs on each pri—miRNA and the
intragenic miRNAs got more ESTs than the intergenic ones as ex—
pected. The distribution of EST coverage for pri—miRNAs (see
Supplementary Fig. S2a in Supplementary File S2) also showed that
most pri—miRNAs had a high EST coverage. The considerable num—
ber of overlapping ESTs supported the existence of the pri—miRNAs
originating from the thus identified TSSs.

Theoretically, only the sequences downstream to TSSs could be
detected as ESTs. Therefore, the differences of EST coverage depth
between upstream and downstream to predicted TSSs were checked
as an evaluation of biological authenticity for predictions. By aver—
aging the EST coverage depth around all identified TSSs in each
work, both the results of Georgakilas et al. (2014), Marsico et al.
(2013) and of our work showed obvious differences of EST coverage
depth in the TSS neighboring region, which supports the authenti—
city of these TSS predictions and the difference of our result was
larger than the other methods (see Supplementary Fig. S3 in
Supplementary File S2). To further evaluate the accuracy of each
method, for each predicted TSS we made a T—test for EST coverage
depth between upstream and downstream 5 kb regions. The TSS
with significant (P value< 0.05) difference was considered as au—
thentic. Our method achieved 74.2% (5365/7228), Georgakilas
et al. achieved 77.2% (122/158) and Marsico et al. achieved 55.0%
(4956/9018) EST supported TSSs (details can be seen in
Supplementary Table S3 of Supplementary Files S2 and File S3). In
comparison, Georgakilas et al. got the highest accuracy and our
method yielded the highest number of EST supported TSSs with ac—
curacy comparable to Georgakilas’s method.

3.2.4 Global feature of conservation

Although the conservation information in a limited region has been
considered to predict TSSs, the conservation feature in a larger re—
gion was still worth to observe (Fig. 1). There was a clear peak of
the conservation score at the location of the identified TSSs for all
three types of TSS, which confirms the functional importance of
TSSs. The conservation level of the regions upstream of the pre—
dicted miRNA TSSs was also high, which might indicate the exist—
ence of orthologous promoters. Notably, such a highly conserved
region of independently transcribed miRNA genes (blue and red
curves in Fig. 1) is much more extensive than that for the host genes
of intragenic miRNAs (black curve in Fig. 1), suggesting that the
promoter regions of the independently transcribed miRNA genes
were longer than those of protein—coding genes. We split the TSS up—
stream regions into windows of 200 bp and made T—tests for the
mean conservation of each window between different types of TSSs.
We found that for all the windows in the region of [—2000 bp,
—200 bp] upstream of TSS, the mean conversation for the

independent TSS of either intergenic miRNA or intragenic miRNA is
significantly higher than that for the host—gene TSS of intragenic
miRNA (see Supplementary Table S4 in Supplementary File S2). The
observation that the promoters of intergenic miRNAs were more con—
served than those of the protein—coding genes was previously made
(Mahony et al., 2007). Here, our result suggests that it is the type of
miRNA transcription (independent or host—gene—dependent transcrip—
tion), instead of miRNA type (intergenic or intragenic miRNA),
that matters the conservation of promoters. However, at the core pro—
moter region which is [—200 bp, 200 bp] around TSS, the conserva—
tion for host—gene TSS is significantly higher than that for
independent TSS (see Supplementary Table S4 in Supplementary File
S2). This observation showed another different pattern of conserva—
tion between the promoters of host—gene—dependently and independ—
ently transcribed miRNA genes. A random creation model proposed
that hairpin structures are generally abundant in eukaryotic genomes,
so the creation of a new miRNA is somehow involved with its appro—
priate transcription (Chen and Raj ewsky, 2007). Therefore, the differ—
ent pattern of conservation on the core promoters and upstream
promoters may indicate a different evolution process for host—gene—
dependently and independently transcribed miRNA genes.

For the regions downstream of the TSSs, the conservation of
miRNA host genes (black curve) decreases much more slowly than
those of independently transcribed miRNA genes (blue and red
curve), because the coding regions of host genes are much more con—
served than intergenic or intronic regions (Siepel et al., 2005). In
conclusion, the observed conservation distribution further supports
the reliability of the TSSs that we identified by this workﬂow.

3.3 Statistics of identified TSSs

We successfully identified TSSs for 663 intragenic miRNAs and 620
intergenic miRNAs, which cover 84.2% (1283/1523) of all miRNAs
in miRBase 18. From the data for 54 different cell lines, we identified
4042 alternative TSSs (including 3758 independent intragenic TSSs
and 284 host TSSs) for intragenic miRNAs and 3186 alternative TSSs
for intergenic miRNAs, which correspond to 6.1 alternative TSSs per
intragenic miRNA and 5.1 alternative TSSs per intergenic miRNA
(Supplementary File S4). After obtaining the cell—specific TSSs, we
constructed a global set of promoters for miRNAs (Supplementary

transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes and to construct a tran—
scriptional regulatory network. For each identified TSS, we con—
sidered the region 1 kb upstream of the TSS as the promoter of each
miRNA. Then, the alternative promoters of one miRNA were merged
if they overlapped by at least 1 bp. In this manner, we obtained 2540
promoters for 1283 miRNAs, which corresponded to 2.0 alternative
promoters for each miRNA.

3.4 Distance from TSS to pre—miRNA

As reported previously, the distance between miRNA TSSs and the
encoded respective pre—miRNAs can range from a few hundred
bases to hundreds of thousands bases (Bhattacharyya et al., 2012).
The distance is very much longer than that of protein—coding genes,
of which the average 5’—untranslated region length of human genes
is 210 bp, with a maximum of 2800 bp (Mignone et al., 2002). Such
extremely long ‘non—coding’ sequences upstream to the pre—miRNA
seem to be unique for miRNAs. For intragenic miRNAs (see
Supplementary Fig. S4a in Supplementary File S2), in this study, the
highest percentage (28.5%) of them had a predicted TSS within 5 kb
upstream of the pre—miRNA and a small percentage (6.4%) of them
had a predicted TSS at a distance greater than 200 kb. For intergenic
miRNAs (see Supplementary Fig. S4b in Supplementary File S2), the
highest percentage (35.2%) of TSSs were also located within 5 kb
upstream of the pre—miRNA and showed a long—tail distribution.
Such long—tail distribution of distance suggested that although most
TSSs are located close to their pre—miRNAs, a significant portion of
TSSs are dispersed widely in distant regions.

To further compare the distances from the TSSs to the pre—
miRNAs in our prediction with previous predictions, we selected
those miRNAs that were common in all studies. Even though our
method has not imposed an artificial upper limit for the TSS — pre—
miRNA distance, most of our predicted TSSs were within 20 kb
range as the cases in the other predictions (Fig. 2), supporting again
the solidity of our predictions.

3.5 Long non—coding RNA and pri—miRNA
Recent studies revealed that the human genome encodes many long
non—coding RNA (lncRNAs), and these non—coding transcription

units might also harbor miRNA genes (Rodriguez et al., 2004). To
check for potential overlaps of the pri—miRNAs in our prediction
with other non—coding transcripts, we mapped them to known
lncRNAs in Ensemble (GRCh37.p13/hg19) (Flicek et al., 2013). We
found that a considerable portion (23.4%) of intergenic pri—
miRNAs overlap with lncRNAs, which is significantly higher than
the percentage of intragenic pri—miRNAs whenever it is transcribed
independently (12.0%) or host—gene—dependently (9.9%). This indi—
cates that some intergenic pri—miRNAs significantly overlap, or are
even identical, with known lncRNAs, which might be a partial ex—
planation for their extended 5’—leader sequences.

3.6 CAGE tags around predicted TSSs of expressed
miRNA indicate a decrease of 5’ cap in cytosol

We used the ‘CSHL Small RNA—seq’ dataset (GSE24565) (Djebali
et al., 2012) to select the expressed miRNAs. We checked the
miRNAs expressed in the cell line A549, for which we considered pre—
miRNAs with an reads per million (RPM) value > 0 to be expressed.

CAGE experiments were designed to capture the 5’—cap of tran—
scripts and the first ~27 bp of its cDNA were usually sequenced. Pri—
miRNA is initially transcribed as a long transcript with a 5’—cap and
a polyA tail and then loses most of its 5’—leader sequence, including
the cap, before being transported into the cytosol. In this study, the
CAGE signal dataset (GSE34448) (Djebali et al., 2012) was derived
from UCSC track ‘RIKEN CAGE Loc Track’. Two kinds of CAGE
signals are included. The CAGE signals that are detected in nucleus
is termed as the nuclear CAGE signals, whereas the signals detected
in cytosol are the cytosolic CAGE signals. We mapped the nuclear
and cytosolic CAGE signals separately to our predicted TSSs of the
miRNAs expressed in A549 cells.

For the host—gene TSSs, we observed a strong CAGE signal at the
TSS location and its nearby downstream region (Fig. 3a). This is
consistent with the finding that protein—coding genes are usually
highly expressed and keep their 5’ cap intact. For the TSSs of inter—
genic miRNAs, we noticed that the absolute level of the CAGE sig—
nal was much lower than that for host—gene TSSs (Fig. 3b). This
might be resulted from a lower expression level of miRNAs and was
certainly inﬂuenced by the rapid 5’ —processing of pri—miRNAs.
Nevertheless, we observed a clear CAGE signal at the predicted
TSSs and in the associated downstream regions. This signal was
stronger in the nucleus than in the cytosol where most processed
pre—miRNAs were localized. For the independent TSSs of intragenic
miRNAs, they showed a signal distribution similar to that of inter—
genic miRNAs in two aspects: (i) an absolute lower level of signal
when compared with host genes and (ii) a stronger signal in the nu—
cleus than in the cytosol (Fig. 3c). To further evaluate the difference

 

of mean CAGE signal at the predicted TSSs between nucleus and
cytosol, we made paired sample Wilcoxon signed rank tests for the
three types of TSSs. The mean value of CAGE signal ‘peak’ is calcu—
lated for each miRNA (Supplementary File S8), and the ‘peak’ is the
region [—10 bp, 50 bp] around TSS as shown in Figure 3. We found
that for the independent TSSs of both intragenic and intergenic
miRNAs, their mean CAGE signals at TSSs are significantly
(P value : 0.007 and 9.490 X 10 T 5) higher in nucleus than cytosol,
while the host—gene TSSs are not (P value : 0.563). This observation
indicates a decrease of 5’ cap for independently transcribed miRNAs
in cytosol.

In conclusion, clear CAGE signals could be observed near the
predicted TSSs, providing further support for the viability of our
TSS predictions. Additionally, the signal differences between the nu—
cleus and cytosol confirmed the current model of miRNA
biogenesis.

4. Discussion

In this study, we developed a method for miRNA TSS prediction by
integrating the information of experimental data of H3K4me3 and
DHS, the species conservation and sequence features. Compared
with other methods that are based on histone modification (Marson
et al., 2008; Ozsolak et al., 2008; Vrba et al., 2011), we used DHSs
data to assure the function of promoters upstream of the predicted
TSSs. In addition, instead of pooling data of different cell lines
(Chien et al., 2011; Marsico et al., 2013; Vrba et al., 2011), the in—
formation from 54 cell lines was processed separately in our work—
ﬂow. This proves useful for conducting experiments and analyzing
the cell specificity of miRNA TSSs. To evaluate the performance of
our method, a set of experimentally verified miRNA TSSs were col—
lected from literature as benchmark data and our method performs
best comparing with other predictions. To evaluate the performance
of our method in a cell—specific way, a set of cell—specific validated
miRNA TSSs in hESC cells were used to make an independent com—
parison. Our method performed better than those non—cell—specific
methods but worse than microTSS. However, the input data for our
method were more easily acquirable than microTSS, which enabled
us to make predictions in a broader range of 54 cell lines with an ac—
ceptable precision (77.1 %).

In our method, we set a distance threshold to discriminate a can—
didate TSS from its nearby annotated host TSS. Only the candidate
TSS that is more than this threshold distance away from its nearby
host TSS was considered as independent TSS. We set this distance
threshold to 150 bp based on the length of an H3K4me3 peak,
assuming that there is only one TSS in one H3K4me3 peak region.

The inﬂuence of this threshold on the prediction was checked. The
number of intergenic and intragenic miRNAs stays at about 620 and
663, respectively, as the variation of threshold (Supplementary Fig.
S5 in Supplementary File S2). For the number of TSSs, on average,
every intergenic/intragenic miRNA loses about 0.0014/0.0026 TSSs
as the threshold increases by 1 bp (Supplementary Fig. S6 in
Supplementary File S2). The accuracy evaluated by experimentally
validated TSSs is not inﬂuenced by the change. Therefore, the inﬂu—
ence of changing the threshold to TSS prediction is limited.

It has always been a dispute whether CAGE data are able to effi—
ciently capture the miRNA TSS because of the transient nature of
miRNA primary transcripts. To clarify this issue, we analyzed the
CAGE signal at predicted miRNA TSS and found the nuclear CAGE
signal was much higher than the cytosolic CAGE signal at TSS loca—
tion. It is evident that the CAGE signal at miRNA TSS would be
reduced if the nuclear and cytosolic CAGE signals were pooled to—
gether. To deal with this problem, a deep—sequencing approach was
employed to increase the CAGE signal at miRNA TSS by increasing
the total count of reads (Georgakilas et al., 2014; Marsico et al.,
2013). However, the deep sequencing data may also increase the
‘noise’ signal in the background region and promoter region of pro—
tein—coding gene. To properly and efficiently use CAGE data, main—
taining the full miRNA primary transcript is necessary. Such as in
Caenorloabditis elegans (Saito et al., 2013), full transcripts could be
maintained when RNAs were isolated from nucleolus. Alternatively,
inhibition of Drosha could help to maintain full transcripts for deep
sequencing (Georgakilas et al., 2014). However, this kind of data
are very limited at present time.

In our result, we noticed that some of the miRNAs had quite
long primary transcripts. For example, hsa—mir—548as is embedded
in its host gene, GPC5, and its host transcript is over 1000 kb. The
long pri—miRNA transcript might provide the possibility of more al—
ternative TSSs.

On the basis of the analysis of species conservation of miRNA
promoter, we found that for the upstream promoters of TSS which
were regions of [—2000 bp, —200 bp], the mean conservation in the
case that miRNAs are independently transcribed was significantly
higher than that in the case that miRNAs are co—transcribed with the
host genes. However, at the core promoter region which is [—200
bp, 200 bp], the conservation behaves in opposite. This observation
showed a different pattern of conservation between the promoters
of host—gene—dependently and independently transcribed miRNA
genes. Mahony et al. (2007) found the promoters of intergenic
miRNAs were even more conserved than those of the intragenic
miRNAs that are co—transcribed with the host genes in opossum.
Godnic et al. (2013) found only 27 conserved host—intragenic
miRNA pairs from 849 intragenic miRNAs in humans, indicating
the poor conservation for the promoters of host—genes—dependent
miRNAs. Our result is consistent with these reports and draws a bet—
ter explanation for these observations. The different pattern of con—
servation on the core promoters and upstream promoters may
indicate a different evolution process for host gene—dependently and
independently transcribed miRNA genes.

MiRNAs are mainly expressed in a cell—specific manner (Lagos—
Quintana et al., 2002; Landgraf et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2007),
which could originate from the use of selectively activated TSSs and
specific promoters. However, it should be noticed that there is no
unambiguous correspondence between expression of a gene and its
active TSS, neither for protein coding nor for miRNA genes. As re—
ported for protein—coding genes, many genes do not produce full
length transcripts, nonetheless experience transcript initiation
(Guenther et al., 2007). As reported from microTSS, for 118

predicted TSSs, 57 miRNAs were expressed in mESC. Similarly in
our result, for 653 predicted TSSs, 146 miRNAs were expressed in
A549 (GSE24565). So current methods could predict the possibly
active TSSs, but there still needs more efforts to fill in the gap be—
tween the transcription and expression of miRNAs. Anyway, to
know the active transcription start site is the first step.

In conclusion, we predicted the miRNA TSSs for 54 cell lines
and several observations were made about the cell line specificity of
different types of TSSs, the conservation of miRNA promoters and
the long non—coding RNAs related to pri—miRNAs. These results
from this research could benefit the understanding of the specific ex—
pression of miRNAs and their exact regulation network in different
cells.

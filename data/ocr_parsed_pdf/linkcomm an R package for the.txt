ABSTRACT

Summary: An essential element when analysing the structure,
function, and dynamics of biological networks is the identification
of communities of related nodes. An algorithm proposed recently
enhances this process by clustering the links between nodes,
rather than the nodes themselves, thereby allowing each node
to belong to multiple overlapping or nested communities. The
R package ‘linkcomm’ implements this algorithm and extends it
in several aspects: (i) the clustering algorithm handles networks
that are weighted, directed, or both weighted and directed;
(ii) several visualization methods are implemented that facilitate the
representation of the link communities and their relationships; (iii) a
suite of functions are included for the downstream analysis of the link
communities including novel community-based measures of node
centrality; (iv) the main algorithm is written in C++ and designed
to handle networks of any size; and (v) several clustering methods
are available for networks that can be handled in memory, and the
number of communities can be adjusted by the user.

1 INTRODUCTION

The advent of high-throughput technologies in the biological
sciences has resulted in a large amount of data that can often be
represented as systems of interacting elements, such as genes or
proteins. To understand how the nodes in these networks relate to
one another and how the topologies of the networks inﬂuence how
they work, an extremely useful analytical approach is to identify sets
of related nodes, known as communities (Radicchi et al., 2004).
Until recently, this was conducted by clustering nodes in the
network, however, a major drawback to this approach is that each
node can belong to only a single community and in densely-
connected networks, subnetworks may often overlap to such an
extent that this approach becomes unsuitably restrictive. A superior
method that circumvents this constraint is to cluster the links
between nodes, thereby allowing nodes to belong to multiple
communities and consequently revealing the overlapping and nested

structure of the network (Ahn et al., 2010; Evans and Lambiotte,
2009). We implement the algorithm outlined by Ahn et al. (2010),
which employs the Jaccard coefﬁcient for assigning similarity
between links, eik and ejk, that share a node, k,

|n+(i)0n+(i)|

, l
|n+(i)Un+(i)| ( )

S(e,-k,ejk)=

where n+(i) refers to the ﬁrst-order node neighbourhood of node 1'.
After assigning pairwise similarities to all of the links in the network,
the links are hierarchically clustered and the resulting dendrogram is
cut at a point that maximizes the density of links within the clusters
normalizing against the maximum and minimum numbers of links
possible in each cluster, known as the partition density.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

We extend the algorithm so that it can handle networks that
are weighted, directed and both weighted and directed using the
Tanimoto coefﬁcient suggested by Ahn et al. (2010),

aluaj

S(eik 7 ejk ) = (2)

lai|2+|aj|2—ai-aj

where a,- refers to a vector describing the weights of links between
node i and the nodes in the ﬁrst-order neighbourhoods of both nodes
i and j (equal to 0 in the event of an absent link). For directed
networks, links to nodes shared by both node i and j are given a
user-deﬁned weight below 1 if they are in the opposite orientation.

For networks that have numbers of edges that can be comfortably
handled in memory (adjustable to suit the resources available
to each user), several different hierarchical clustering algorithms
can be chosen. For networks that are too large to be handled in
memory, single-linkage clustering is used to enhance performance
(see Supplementary Material).

To facilitate analysis of the communities generated by the
algorithm, we have included a suite of functions that allow the user
to explore the structure of the communities as they relate to each
other. Included in this are functions to extract the nested structure
of communities and to further cluster the communities themselves
using the Jaccard coefﬁcient and the numbers of nodes shared
by pairs of communities, thereby allowing the user to visualize
the structure of the network across multiple scales (see Fig. 1D).
In addition to this, we provide functions that calculate a novel
community-based measure of node centrality. This measure weights
the number of communities a node belongs to by the average

where the main sum is over the N communities to which node i
belongs, and S(j,k) refers to the similarity between community j
and k, calculated as the J accard coefﬁcient for the number of shared
nodes between each community pair, and this is averaged over the
m communities paired with community j and in which node i jointly
belongs.

We also provide several visualization methods for representing the
link communities (Figs lA—C). Foremost here is an implementation
of a novel method for visualizing link communities (Fig. 1B)
(http://scaledinnovation.com). This algorithm anchors communities
evenly around the circumference of a circle in their dendrogram
order (to minimize crossing over of links) and positions nodes within
the circle according to how many links they possess in each of the
communities. Thus, nodes that have links to a lot of communities
will get pushed into the centre of the circle making this method well
suited for representing ego networks where one or a small number
of nodes belong to multiple communities (Fig. 1B).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We ran the algorithm on a large gene co-expression network derived
from Drosophila melanogaster embryonic in situ expression data
(Tomancak et al., 2007). This weighted network contains 106 357
links, 1031 nodes, and an average degree of 206. Links between
genes indicate that the genes are co-expressed in at least one tissue
during the ﬁnal stages of embryonic development, and the weights
attached to the links refer to the similarity of expression patterns for
pairs of genes, calculated using the Jaccard coefﬁcient (based on the
numbers of shared tissues).

The algorithm produced 873 non-trivial communities (composed
of more than two edges). Further clustering of these communities

allowed us to extract 11 meta-communities, where again nodes may
appear multiple across different meta-communities (Fig. 1D).

Using our measure of community centrality (3) we ﬁnd that genes
expressed in the gut, epidermis and pharynx structures tend to appear
in many communities and hence tend to be expressed in many
different tissues. Conversely, genes expressed in the yolk, fat body,
eye, brain and ventral cord tend to be expressed in fewer tissues
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). These results allow us to identify
genes that may have more or less speciﬁc roles during the ﬁnal stages
of embryonic development.

In ﬁiture versions of the package we aim to implement a
visualization method that will allow the user to zoom interactively
into the network so that large networks can be plotted in their entirety
without losing access to information at the local scale (Saalfeld et al.,
2009).

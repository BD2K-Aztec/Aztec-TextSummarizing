Abstract

Motivation: Supervised machine learning is widely applied to transcriptomic data to predict dis—
ease diagnosis, prognosis or survival. Robust and interpretable classifiers with high accuracy are
usually favored for their clinical and translational potential. The top scoring pair (TSP) algorithm is
an example that applies a simple rank—based algorithm to identify rank—altered gene pairs for classi—
fier construction. Although many classification methods perform well in cross—validation of single
expression profile, the performance usually greatly reduces in cross—study validation (i.e. the pre—
diction model is established in the training study and applied to an independent test study) for all
machine learning methods, including TSP. The failure of cross—study validation has largely dimin—
ished the potential translational and clinical values of the models. The purpose of this article is to
develop a meta—analytic top scoring pair (MetaKTSP) framework that combines multiple transcrip—
tomic studies and generates a robust prediction model applicable to independent test studies.
Results: We proposed two frameworks, by averaging TSP scores or by combining P—values from in—
dividual studies, to select the top gene pairs for model construction. We applied the proposed
methods in simulated data sets and three large—scale real applications in breast cancer, idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis and pan—cancer methylation. The result showed superior performance of cross—
study validation accuracy and biomarker selection forthe new meta—analytic framework. In conclu—
sion, combining multiple omics data sets in the public domain increases robustness and accuracy
of the classification model that will ultimately improve disease understanding and clinical treat—
ment decisions to benefit patients.

2 Methods

2.1 TSP algorithm and kTSP

The original TSP algorithm was first proposed by Geman et al.
(2004). Denote by data matrix X : {xgn} the gene expression inten—
sity of gene g (1 g g g G) in sample n (1 S n S N) and y" the class
label of sample n. Particularly, we consider yn 6 {0,1}, representing
controls and cases for binary classification in this article. For any gene
pair 1' and j (1 S i, j S G), define the conditional ordering probability
score Ti): (C): Pr(X, < leY : C) for C 6 {0,1}, where X, and
X, are gene expression intensities of gene 1' and /. Intuitively, T,(0) is
the probability in controls that gene / has larger expression intensity
than that of gene 1' and similarly T,,(1) is for cases. Given observed ex—
pression profile data matrix X, the probability scores can be estimated
as ﬁre) 2 (22:11pm < won 2 c>>/<Zf.:11<yn 2 c», where
I (~) is an indicator function that generates value one if the statement
inside the parenthesis is true and zero otherwise. The discriminant
score of the gene pair is defined as S,; : T,,(1) — T,,(0). Note that —1
S S,, S 1 always holds. When S,,: 1, expression of gene / is always
greater than that in gene 1' in cases and expression of gene / is always
smaller than that in gene 1' among controls. As a result, the ordering of
gene 1' and gene / expression is predictive to the class label. On the con—
trary, if S,,: —1, gene / always has a smaller expression than gene 1' in
cases and the relation is reversed in controls. In summary, the absolute
value of S,, reﬂects the predictive value of the gene pair. The TSP algo—
rithm seeks the best gene pair (1", j’) : argmaxi¢leijl as the classifier.
When multiple gene pairs give the same highest absolute score, the
best pair that gives the largest differential magnitude D,, is chosen,
where Dij = ldL;(1) - d1) (0)1 and di/(C) 2 (2521mm —RIn)I(yn I 0/
(211101,, : C)) for CE {0,1}, where Rm is the rank of the ith gene
in the nth sample. When a new test sample 5cm“) : (x1(t$t),. . . ,xcmm)
is encountered in the future, the class prediction is determined by

~ test test
ail/1 (£0680) : 1, lfSiI/v ' (XE, L —x;I L) S 0

0, ing,: . (x9650 — acres”) > 0

By construction, the TSP classifier above is based on only one TSP
(two genes) and the method can be very sensitive to slight noise per—
turbations (Geman et al., 2004). To circumvent this issue, Tan et al.
(2005) introduced kTSP to combine multiple TSPs for a more stable
algorithm. The method identified the sorted TSPs similar to above.
Instead of choosing only the best TSP, it selected the top K (K is a
parameter to be tuned) TSPs to construct the model. The TSPs were
selected from the sorted list such that the genes in the TSPs had no
overlap otherwise the latter TSPs containing overlapping genes
would be skipped and the next TSP in the sorted list would be con—
sidered. In other words, the selected top K TSPs always contain 2K
distinct genes. Suppose {(i’1,/’1),...,(i’K,/’K)} represents the K se—
lected TSPs. The kTSP algorithm makes a prediction for a new test
sample 9306“) by C(Ic'mstl) : argmachf:1 I(Cim (56mm) : C). In a
sense, the k—TSP is an ensemble classifier that aggregates multiple
weak classifiers by majority vote (Opitz and Maclin, 1999). To
avoid ties, we usually select odd numbers for K in binary
classification.

The TSP algorithms have the following advantages for omics
prediction analysis: (i) The method is non—parametric since the
method is constructed based on the relative ranking of gene pairs.
Since different transcriptomic studies are usually conducted in

different labs and in different platforms, the applicability of non—
parametric nature facilitates cross—study validation that we aim in
this article. (ii) The method is based on one or a few gene pairs. The
biological interpretation of the model and the translational applica—
tion are more straightforward. It is more likely to succeed by design—
ing a reproducible commercial assay for wider clinical applications,
such as the 21—gene RT—PCR—based Oncotype DX test for breast
cancer (Paik et al., 2004). (iii) Researchers have repeatedly found
that the family of TSP algorithms provides good prediction perform—
ance in many transcriptomic data (Price et al., 2007; Raponi et al.,
2008; Xu et al., 2005).

2.2 Estimate Kfor kTSP
To estimate the best K in the kTSP algorithm, we will apply and
compare the following two methods.

2.2.1 Cross-validation (CV) method

In Tan et al. (2005), leave—one—out CV was used to determine K in
kTSP. In each iteration, one sample was left out as the test sample.
The remaining samples were used to construct a prediction model
and apply to the test sample. The procedure was repeated until each
sample was left out as the test sample once. The cross—validated
error rates were then calculated for different selections of K and the
best K that produced the smallest CV error rate was chosen.

2.2.2 VO method
Afsari et al. (2014) recently developed a V0 method to estimate K

in kTSP. Recall that 3,,- 2 T,,-(1) — T,,-(0), where T,,-(C) 2
(211%,, <x,,,)1(y,, 2 C))/(25:13», 2 C)). The kTSP algorithm
searches for the optimized TSPs without overlapping genes:
{(11771)7"'7(1K7/K)} : argmax{(i1./1).~~(iK~/K)IZIZ:1Sit/1‘
Define the t—statistics of the target function:

K) : 21:1 521,71,
\/Var(Zf:1I(XiL < X,L)|Y:O)+Var(2f:1I(XiL < X,»L)|Y: 1)

 

 

tk'rsr (

K is chosen by the value that maximizes tkTsp (i.e. K”r : arg
mathk-rsp). The V0 procedure greatly reduced high computational
demand in CV.

2.3 MetaKTSP algorithms

As mentioned in the introduction section, cross—study validation via
MegaKTSP (i.e. naively combine multiple normalized data sets and
apply kTSP) may not be suitable to identify a robust prediction gene
pair. Alternatively, we propose a MetaKTSP framework below.
Denote by X0“) : {xgp} the expression profile of study m, where
ng) represents the gene expression intensity of gene g (1 S g g G),
sample n (1 g n g Nlml) in study m (1 g m g M). Let the discrimin—
ant score L for gene 1' and j in study m take the difference of two
averages of Bernoulli random variables. We started by developing
three meta—analytic approaches (by Fisher score, Stouffer score and
mean score) to choose the K non—overlapping TSPs for prediction

model construction (denoted as {(i’f,/’{), . . . , (i;,/}‘<)}). When a new
test sample, 5cm“) : (xgteSt), . . . ,xéeSt ) is encountered in the future,

the class prediction by the lath TSP and study m is:

Below we introduce the three meta—analytic approaches to select
the top K TSPs. In meta—analysis, test statistics (e.g. it t—statistics)
across studies are not comparable and combining P—values has be—
come a popular practice. Under the null hypothesis that gene 1' and j

are not discriminant, S1131) can be well—approximated by Gaussian dis—

tribution   +% N N(0, 1) since S1131) is the difference of

Alternatively, one—sided p—values can be calculated as PETLZL :

 

)/ gfj+%> for left—sided P—value and PET“ :

2.3.1 Select KTSPs by Fisher’s method

The Fisher’s method combines P—values across studies by
SiliFiSher) : —2 X 224:1 log(P),.m)), where P3“) is the two—sided P—value
of the discriminant score SIS-m) of gene 1' and j in study m. Under null

ies may have discordant signs but all with small two—sided P—values
that generate a significant meta—analyzed P—value. To circumvent
this discordant problem, we apply a one—sided test modification

technique discussed in Owen (2009). Define TIL/Figherﬂ : —2><

The top K gene pairs with the largest meta—analyzed Fisher score
(i TgFiSher)ZOC) and with no overlapping genes are selected.

2.3.2 Select K TSPs by Stouffer’s method

Instead of using log—transformation in Fisher’s method, Stouffer’s
method applies an inverse normal transformation by TIL/Stmffer) :
zxd (D— (Pglm):L)/\/M. Under null hypothesis that gene 1' and/ have
no discriminant power in all studies, T,; N N(0,1). The top K gene
pairs with the smallest meta—analyzed two—sided P—values and with
no overlapping genes are selected for prediction. Note that
Stouffer’s method has an advantage over Fisher’s method that one—
sided concordance correction is not necessary if one—sided P—values
are input in the inverse normal transformation.

2.3.3 Select K TSPs by mean score
Because the discriminant score is difference of two conditional prob—

abilities, the scores are directly comparable across studies and can
be directly combined. We define the mean score TIL/mean) *

zxd SILIW/M to combine M studies. The top K gene pairs with the
largest absolute value of the meta—analyzed scores (i.e. (TE/mam) and

with no overlapping genes are selected for prediction model con—

struction. In addition, we propose the weighted mean score TIL/mean)

: 2M S).{'1)11("7)/(Zx:1 MW), where 111‘“) is sample size of study

m:1 I]
m. It is commonplace that each study has a range of sample size,
and the variance of SW) is increasingly influenced as sample size
rises. Therefore, it is worth to adjust sample size to the total discrim—
inant score.

2.4 Estimate Kfor MetaKTSP
Similar to Section 2.2, cross—validation and V0 methods can be ex—
tended to estimate K for MetaKTSP.

2.4.1 Cross-validation

Each of the M studies are firstly split into V equal—sized subgroups.
In each cross—validation, one subgroup of samples in each study is
left out as the testing samples. The remaining (V — 1) subgroups are
used as training samples to construct the classifier and then apply to
the test sample. We choose the optimal K such that the highest aver—
age Youden index over M studies is obtained. In this article, we
adopted 5 —fold cross—validation.

2.4.2 Variance optimization
Motivated by Afsari et al. (2014), we define the following target
function:

2:11:30) 2

M K
Zm:1 Zk:1 
Var(2:21:::11(><§§” < xgmmy 2 0)
“[31:52 23:11“)? < Xﬁflyy 2 1)

K is chosen by the value that maximizes t£¥§;a)(K) (i.e.
K" : argmathlil-Tr‘gga)  We will show its equal or slightly improved
performance compared with CV in our proposed meta—analytic

scheme and this estimation method will be recommended in

 

 

practice.

strong TSP scores over multiple training studies such gene pairs out—
perform original TSPs from a single study. We tested this hypothet—
ical argument using simulated data sets. Below we describe
simulated expression profiles under correlated gene structures to
mimic real data sets. We performed a smaller scale of simulation

In practice, one may perform such CV to exclude potential ‘outlier’
studies before implementing MetaKTSP.

Below we explore biological validation of detected gene pairs
from MetaKTSP using existing literature. We first applied
MetaKTSP (VO + mean) to all seven breast cancer studies and iden—
tified nine TSPs. For the 18 genes in the 9 detected TSPs, 12 of them
were found to associate with ER expression in previous publications
and all of them had consistent differential expression direction com—
pared with the microarray data (Table 1 ). For the pan—cancer methy—
lation result, we also identified 9 TSPs and 15 of the 18 genes have
been previously indicated as cancer related (Supplementary Table
S3). For example, the PCDH8 gene from the fourth gene pair was
previously confirmed as a candidate tumor suppressor regulated by
methylation in multiple cancers: (i) Kidney cancer: frequent pro—
moter region methylation (58%) in primary renal cell carcinoma
tumor samples (Morris et al., 2011). (ii) Breast cancer: either muta—
tion or epigenetic silencing in a high fraction of breast carcinomas
inactivates PCDH8 that leads to oncogenesis in cancers (Yu et al.,
2008) (iii) Stomach cancer: tumor suppressor function in gastric
cancer (Zhang et al., 2012).

4 Conclusion and discussion

As high—throughput experimental data become more and more
prevalent and publicly available, integrative methods to fully utilize
information from the abundant multi—lab data sets have become crit—
ical. Generating predictive biomarkers and classification model
from a single study often suffer from limited sample size and pos—
sibly study—specific biases. The resulting models are often found
with poor performance in cross—study validation (Correa and Reis—
Filho, 2009; McShane et al., 2013; Kern, 2012; Reid et al., 2005).
To improve translational and clinical utility of the biomarker dis—
covery and classification model construction, combining informa—
tion from multiple studies provide a promising opportunity. In this
article, we seek to improve a TSP method that is a non—parametric,
accurate and easily interpretable model that likely will succeed in
cross—study validation for clinical applications. We developed three
MetaKTSP approaches that combine multiple omics data sets to im—
prove the credibility of TSP biomarker selection. Using simulations
and real transcriptome and methylome data sets, we demonstrate its
improved performance on cross—study validation. We compared two
methods, CV and V0, to decide the number of TSPs used in the
model construction. The result showed similar performance of the
two model selection methods. Since VO does not involve repeated
subsampling and is computationally faster, we recommend to use
V0 for future applications.

There are a few limitations and future directions to consider.
First, our method and evaluation focus on binary case—control clas—
sification. The method could be extended to multi—class classifica—
tion scenario. Second, biological knowledge such as pathways or
known disease relevant genes can be incorporated to enhance the
TSP discovery accuracy. For example, Oncotype DX started with
250 breast cancer related genes to identify the 21 predictive genes
in their panel. Although this runs the risk to miss understudied but
significant biomarkers, this approach can potentially improve
cross—study validation in well—studied diseases. Third, we may take
into account the original differences across platforms to pursue
more accurate meta—analysis. In particular, gene expression plat—
forms may measure different genes on different scales. Therefore, it
is worth to match up genes across platforms by mapping onto iden—
tical exon sites and probes. Finally, the current TSP approaches

may be extended towards module—based prediction scheme where
TSPs of gene modules are sought to provide extra redundancy and
robustness (Mi et al., 2010). The ‘MetaKTSP’ R package is avail—
able on the authors website and is part of MetaOmics, a software
suite for omics data meta—analysis of differentially expressed gene
detection, pathway, prediction, clustering, classification and net—
work analyses.

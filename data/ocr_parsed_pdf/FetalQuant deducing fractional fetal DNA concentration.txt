FetalQuant

 

4.1 Dependence on the sequencing depth and the number
of SNP loci in the regions of interest

The sequencing depth and the number of informative SNP loci
used in the model ﬁtting are two major factors that affect the
accuracy of the FetalQuant algorithm. In general, the larger the
number of informative SNP loci that is used, the less sequencing
depth one would require achieving the same level of estimation
accuracy. In our targeted MPS experiments, FetalQuant could
accurately deduce the fractional fetal DNA concentrations for
most of the samples with the number of SNP loci covered in
different regions of the chromosomes (~27 000 SNPs in
Dataset 1 and ~12 500 SNPs in Dataset 2).

However, our data showed that there were four cases deviating
from the diagonal line (Fig. 4B, top—right within black circle),
indicating comparatively lower deduction accuracies for those
samples. We reasoned that it might be largely due to the rela—
tively shallow sequencing depth (~50—fold). In contrast, the de—
viations from the diagonal line of the remaining samples were
relatively small that coincided with the relatively high sequencing
depth (~100—fold). Further study based on the simulated data
showed that 1000 SNP loci and 200—fold sequencing coverage
would be necessities for accurately deducing the fractional fetal
DNA concentration at 5% level with degree of deviation less
than 5%. Furthermore, the computational simulation also sug—
gests that there is still room for improving the deduction accur—
acy by increasing the sequencing depth for our empirical
datasets.

4.2 Costs and potential applications of FetalQuant

This approach could be adopted for the MPS—based non—invasive
prenatal diagnosis, e. g. fetal aneuploidy detection. As a
proof—of—principle study, the target enrichment in this study
was performed in a non—multiplexed manner, in which one cap—
ture library could be used for only one sample. Recently, target
capture systems with multiplexing capability have become avail—
able from three major commercial suppliers, in which one cap—
ture library could accommodate multiple indexed samples.
Considering the rapidly dropping cost in target enrichment and
sequencing, we expect that the cost of this approach would go
down to below US $100 per sample.

4.3 Limitations

One potential limitation of FetalQuant is that it assumes the
SNPs are randomly distributed across the whole genome. In
reality, there are some distributional bias of SNPs, for example,
the neighboring—nucleotide patterns of transitions were domi—
nated by the hyper—mutability effects of CpG dinucleotides and
transitions are four times more frequent than transversions
among the substitution mutations (Zhao and Boerwinkle,
2002). In addition, FetalQuant assumes that sequencing errors
are random. However, sequencing errors have some preference
and it is especially true for low—quality bases and those near the
3/—end of reads. AC and GT miscalls during base calling are
significantly over—represented (Li et al., 2009). Currently, align—
ment errors are not fully taken into account in the model because
SOAP2 does not provide the alignment uncertainties in a prob—
abilistic manner (Li et al., 2009). Furthermore, the allelic count

bias introduced during the sequencing alignment (Degner et al.,
2009) or allele—specific copy number variation might affect the
fractional fetal DNA concentration deduction. However, as the
number of SNP loci (~12 500) used for estimating fetal DNA
fraction is large and disperse, the specific bias caused by certain
SNP(s) may contribute little to the current model. In the future,
the FetalQuant model can be further improved by taking into
count the alignment bias, the SNP substitution patterns, as well
as copy number variation on SNP loci.

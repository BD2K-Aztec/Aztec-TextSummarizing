The process is automated so that new MoRFs can be collected from
membrane proteins, as novel structures are deposited in PDB. Finally, we
organized all data in a publicly available mySQL database, with a user-
friendly web interface based on HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript.
Protein information can be accessed through three different ﬁle formats
(Fasta, Text and XML), apart from the classic web view. Moreover, the
entire database can be downloaded locally for further analysis.

3 RESULTS

The database includes 173 membrane proteins containing 244
MoRFs. Membrane proteins are divided in 102 transmembrane
proteins (70 single-spanning and 32 multi-spanning) and 71 periph-
eral membrane proteins. MoRFs were classiﬁed in categories ac-
cording to their secondary structure when bound to their partners,
with 33.47% categorized as oz-MoRFs, 3.83% as ﬂ-MoRFs,
60.48% as i—MoRFs and 2.22% as complex-MoRFs.

In the main page of mpMoRFsDB, a user may ﬁnd links to the
following tools: Browse, Search, Blast Search and Download.
Through the Browse page, the user has the ability to browse all
the entries. Moreover, there is an option for browsing by membrane
protein type (transmembrane or peripheral) or by the secondary
structure of MoRFs (oz-MoRFs, ﬂ-MoRFs, i-MoRFs and com-
plex-MoRFs). Through Search, the user may submit advanced
queries, whereas through Blast Search, we provide an interface for
running Blast searches against the database. Each entry contains
information about the respective membrane protein and related
MoRFs. A Jmol (Hanson, 2010) applet is integrated for visualiza-
tion of the structures, and cross-references to many publicly avail-
able databases are included, providing information for protein
domains, molecular interactions and diseases. In the case of trans-
membrane proteins, we determined whether the MoRFs are pos-
itioned in the cytoplasmic or the extracellular space. We observed
that the majority of MoRFs in transmembrane proteins are found in
the cytoplasmic side.

4 DISCUSSION

A database containing MoRFs in membrane proteins was con-
structed. Data were collected with automated Perl scripts and ver-
iﬁed manually. The whole process can easily be repeated, and we
intend to update the database every 6 months. The proteins in our
database are highly connected nodes in protein interaction net-
works (52% of mpMoRFsDB’s entries have more than ﬁve inter-
actions in molecular interaction databases) and are essential to cell
survival (Jeong et al., 2001). mpMoRFsDB provides an up—to-date
dataset, which can be used for the design and evaluation of meth-
ods predicting MoRFs in membrane proteins. The database will
contribute to the emerging ‘protein non-folding problem’ (Dill and
MacCallum, 2012) and provide insights in disorder-based inter-
actions in membrane proteins.

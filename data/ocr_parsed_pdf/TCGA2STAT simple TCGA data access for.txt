Abstract

Motivation: Massive amounts of high—throughput genomics data profiled from tumor samples
were made publicly available by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Results: We have developed an open source software package, TCGAZSTAT, to obtain the TCGA
data, wrangle it, and pre—process it into a format ready for multivariate and integrated statistical
analysis in the R environment. In a user—friendly format with one single function call, our package
downloads and fully processes the desired TCGA data to be seamlessly integrated into a computa—
tional analysis pipeline. No further technical or biological knowledge is needed to utilize our soft—
ware, thus making TCGA data easily accessible to data scientists without specific domain

knowledge.

Availability and implementation: TCGAZSTAT is available from the https://cran.r—project.org/web/

packages/TCGAZSTAT/index.html.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

1 Introduction

Over the last decade, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium
has measured large-scale genomics and clinical profiles of cancer pa-
tients so that scientists can study tumor genomes and decipher the gen-
etic underpinnings of cancer. The TCGA data can be downloaded
from web portals or via web services, such as the TCGA data portal
(https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/), cBio (Cerami et (11., 2012; Gao
et (11., 2013), canEvolve (Samur et (11., 2013), or Broad Institute GDAC
Firehose lhttp://gdac.broadinstitute.org/). However, manual download
of this massive data is time consuming and web service calls like the
firehoseiget function require additional program installation and
technical setup. Most importantly, these two approaches cannot be eas-
ily integrated into a framework for statistical analysis. Many extra
steps and technical knowledge of molecular platform data formats are
needed to wrangle and pre-process the data before it can be statistically
analyzed. Further, this process must be repeated when new data

versions or additional samples become available, hindering efforts at
version-control and reproducible research.

Others have provided software to obtain the TCGA data. cBio,
for example, provides an R and Matlab package but was not de-
signed to be used for genome-scale data analysis. It requires input of
a list of genes from users and thus limits the exploratory use of the
data. Another R package, RTCGAToolbox downloads TCGA data
from Firehose (Samur, 2014), but the downloaded data is not pre-
processed into data formats conducive for multivariate statistical
analysis. Further, linking and merging functions necessary for inte-
grated statistical analyses such as sample matching across multiple
platforms and merging clinical and molecular data are not available
in this package.

Because of these problems, use of the TCGA data can be limited
to those with domain expertise, rendering the data inaccessible for
general data scientists. In response, we have developed an R package

4 Conclusion

We have developed an R package that seamlessly downloads and pre—
processes the TCGA data into objects ready for integrated statistical
analysis. An advantage of this package is that users can obtain and
maintain the large—scale TCGA data without additional technical
knowledge other than R scripting. Our package will thus encourage
many data scientists to mine this rich data source, potentially leading
to breakthroughs in cancer genomics.

2.4 Copy number variation

The GISTIC 2.0 algorithm (Mermel et al., 2011) is used to produce copy
number variation data. This preprocessing step is conducted by TCGA’s
GDAC Firehose and the results are provided. Using anonimized patient
identiﬁcation codes, for each patient, the overall number of genes with
gains/losses within the patient’s genome is stored and is used to ﬁlter out
genomes with a high number of aberrations.

2.5 GISTIC copy number variation versus RNASeq gene
expression

Anonymous patient identiﬁcation numbers, provided by TCGA, were

used to determine patients where both GISTIC copy number and

RNASeq gene expression data were available. These data were used to

ﬁnd correlations between copy number variation and gene expression

levels in tumor samples.

2.6 Promoter methylation in cancer

Promoter methylation data are downloaded exclusively from TCGA’s
Firehose, but it is derived from two platforms, Human Methylation
27k (strictly promoter methylation) and Human Methylation 450k
(whole genome methylation). Promoter methylation using the Human
Methylation 450k array was deﬁned as 1000 bp upstream the transcrip-
tion start site, which was determined for all genes using coordinates from
the refGene table from the UCSC table browser (http://genome.ucsc.
edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?command=start).

3 RESULTS

Rather than listing gene—speciﬁc links to existing cancer genomics
portals, Chromohub provides integrated data focused on chro—
matin signaling. Users can visualize on phylogenetic trees of
protein families involved in epigenetic mechanisms the percent
of tumor samples across large patient cohorts where a gene is
mutated (compared with a non—tumor sample from the same
patient). Highly mutated genomes can be excluded from the ana—
lysis by setting a threshold for the maximum number of genes
mutated in a sample. The output is grouped by cancer type. As of
October 2013, 16 cancer types are represented by cohorts of >100
patients. High or low copy number gains as well as heterozygous
and homozygous deletions [corresponding to GISTIC values of
2, l, —1 and —2, respectively (Mermel et al., 2011)] can also be
plotted on phylogenetic trees. Statistically relevant data (>100
patients) are available for nine cancer types. Unlike mutation
data, copy numbers are compared with those in the reference
human genome.

In addition to chromosomal aberrations, changes in transcrip—
tion profiles are also available: mRNA levels are compared be—
tween tumor and non—tumor samples from the same patient and
tissue. This provides a bird’s eye view of genes that are over—
expressed or repressed in speciﬁc cancer types for any protein
family related to epigenetic mechanisms. Orthogonal data types
can be projected on a tree simultaneously. For instance, combin—
ing mRNA expression and mutation data, users can rapidly see
that the histone methyltransferase MLL3 is mutated in 7% (54 of
776) and repressed in 21% (23 of 107) of breast cancer samples,
suggesting that this gene acts as a tumor suppressor.

Change in expression of a given gene is generally not driving
cancer initiation or progression, but simply a passenger event
(Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011), unless it is directly caused by

a chromosomal ampliﬁcation or deletion (Beroukhim et al.,
2007; Eifert and Powers, 2012). To identify candidate driver
events affecting chromatin factors, Chromohub allows users to
automatically highlight genes where overexpression correlates
with copy number gains. Using this approach, one can rapidly
see that, among genes containing a Tudor domain (which bind
methylated lysines and arginines), FXRl is overexpressed and
ampliﬁed in 53% (18 of 34) lung squamous cell carcinoma
patients.

4 CONCLUSION

Dysregulation of the chromatin signaling platform plays a major
role in cancer (Baylin and Jones, 2011; Timp and Feinberg, 2013;
You and Jones, 2012); chromosomal aberrations and transcrip—
tional alteration affecting chromatin factors can drive initiation
and development of speciﬁc cancer types. The new Chromohub
interface is a simple tool to navigate the cancer genomics of
epigenetic mechanisms.

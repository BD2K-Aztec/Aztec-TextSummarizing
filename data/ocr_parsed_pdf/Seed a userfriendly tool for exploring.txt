ABSTRACT

Summary: In this article we present Simple Exploration of Ecological
Data (Seed), a data exploration tool for microbial communities. Seed is
written in R using the Shiny library. This provides access to powerful
R-based functions and libraries through a simple user interface. Seed
allows users to explore ecological datasets using principal coordinate
analyses, scatter plots, bar plots, hierarchal clustering and heatmaps.
Availability and implementation: Seed is open source and available
at https://github.com/danlbek/Seed.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

The proliferation of microbial community proﬁling is allowing
researchers to study microbial communities in new ways.
Increasingly, researchers in diverse fields are asking questions
relating to how microbial communities vary across samples.
For example, researchers studying the human microbiome are
interested in how microbial composition changes across body
sites and through time (HMP Consortium et al., 2012).
Researchers studying disease look at how microbial communities
differ between samples from healthy and unhealthy individuals
(Srinivasan and Fredricks, 2009). It is now standard practice to
use cultivation independent high-throughput sequencing to iden-
tify the microbial composition of many samples. This produces a
wealth of data about microbial composition in many different
environments and conditions.

In conjunction with advances in sequencing resources,
researchers have developed a number of powerful software tools
to analyze and Visualize this wealth of data. Packages such as
mothur (Schloss et al., 2009) and Qiime (Caporaso et al., 2010)
aggregate many tools to allow researchers to quickly and
efﬁciently process large sequencing datasets. These currently
available packages excel at performing robust, computationally
intensive calculations that attempt to minimize the effects of noise
and sequencing artifacts on downstream analyses. They often use
a non-Visual interface for analysis, even when they provide a gra-
phical user interface for their own functions, requiring the user to
know speciﬁc command and parameter combinations. While this

setup is ideal for pipeline development, it is often a hindrance for
data exploration.

Simple Exploration of Ecological Data (Seed) fills a currently
unmet need for a tool that allows researchers to quickly and
easily Visualize and explore the data that results from these pipe-
lines. This so-called exploratory data analysis has an ‘important
place in the toolbox of ecologists’ (Borcard et al., 2011). Though
there are texts that recommend speciﬁc exploratory techniques
(Borcard et al., 2011; Legendre and Legendre, 2012), we know of
no tool such as Seed that bundles appropriate tools into an
easy-to-use system for non-programmers.

In this article, we present Seed, a software package that
focuses on data exploration and Visualization of microbial com-
munity data derived from high-throughput sequencing.

2 SEED SOFTWARE

Seed is an open-source application that allows researchers to
Visually explore microbial community data. It is designed to
allow many different analyses and Visualizations including
principal component and coordinate analysis (PCA/PCOA),
hierarchal clustering, scatter plots, bar plots and heatmaps.
These plots allow users to Visualize similarities and differences
among samples and how environmental and microbial features
vary across samples.

Seed is written in the R programming language (R Core Team,
2013) using the Shiny framework (RStudio Inc., 2013). R is open
source and available for Linux, MacOS and Windows operating
systems. The use of R allows us to take advantage of the wealth
of R packages available for complex analyses and Visualizations.

Seed is a web-based application, which may be installed locally
or hosted on a remote server. When running Seed from a central
server, users can access it through a web browser and are not
required to install it locally. This means non-expert users can
quickly and easily begin using Seed, even without local installa-
tions of R. Additionally, updates to R, Shiny, Seed and under-
lying packages can be done seamlessly and invisibly to the end
user. The use of a web browser also provides a familiar interface
to most users, allowing them to quickly and easily learn to use
Seed. The user interface for seed can be seen in Figure 1.

Currently, Seed requires two types of data, microbial abun-
dance data and sample metadata. The microbial abundance data
contain counts or abundances of each microbial taxon in each
sample. The sample metadata contain information about each
sample, for example the sample pH or temperature. Seed allows
the user to modify the abundance data using a number
of common transformations including presence/absence, relative

abundance and Hellinger transformations. Seed is not limited to
microbial data, though that was our primary research domain. It
can be used to explore any data that include both feature counts
and values for response variables.

Once the user has imported and veriﬁed their dataset, they
may easily explore their data with many plot types. Examples
of some of the plots generated by Seed are shown in the supple-
mentary information. Many of the plots include options to in-
corporate sample information by coloring points or bars
according to metadata values. This allows users to easily Visual-
ize the relationship between the sample metadata and the struc-
ture of the microbial communities present in the samples.

The design of Seed emphasizes simplicity over exhaustive in-
clusion of parameters. In many or most cases, researchers will
use Seed to understand general trends in the data, which may
then inform more specialized analyses. Seed is designed to
quickly explore ecological datasets and to act as a hypothesis-
generating tool. Publication quality figures and polished analyses
are beyond the current scope of this project, though Seed can
output all plots in pdf or png format. Additionally, large dataset
analysis may be too slow for a comfortable user experience.
Note, however, that we used published microbiome and patient
data with nearly 400 samples and 250 taxa (Ravel et al., 2011) on
a standard laptop while preparing this publication. Seed is cer-
tainly capable of handling datasets with hundreds of samples and
more than a thousand taxa.

As with any software package, not all analyses have been
implemented in Seed. We encourage users to also consider
other Visualization tools including phyloseq (McMurdie and
Holmes, 2013) for analyses incorporating phylogenetic

relationships and EMPeror (V azquez-Baeza et al., 2013) for
PCoA analyses of very large datasets. Additionally, while Seed
provides some guidance for users, tool selection and result inter-
pretation still relies on user expertise.

3 FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Seed is freely available at https://github.com/danlbek/Seed.
Development of Seed is ongoing. We are continuing to add
new Visualizations and to improve existing ones. Future devel-
opment will focus on adding phylogenetic and taxonomic data
structures, which will allow for analyses that take microbial re-
lationships into account. We welcome user contributions to the
project and encourage labs to copy and modify the code to suit
their own needs.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are flexible and widely
used in scientific studies. Particularly in genomics and genetics,
there are multiple distinct regimes in the genome within each of
which the relationships among multivariate features are distinct.
Examples include differential gene regulation depending on gene func-
tions and experimental conditions, and varying combinatorial patterns
of multiple transcription factors. We developed a software package
called MRHMMs (Multivariate Regression Hidden Markov Models and
the variantS) that accommodates a variety of HMMs that can be flex-
ibly applied to many biological studies and beyond. MRHMMs sup-
plements existing HMM software packages in two aspects. First,
MRHMMs provides a diverse set of emission probability structures,
including mixture of multivariate normal distributions and (logistic) re-
gression models. Second, MRHMMs is computationally efficient for
analyzing large data-sets generated in current genome-wide studies.
Especially, the software is written in C for the speed advantage and
further amenable to implement alternative models to meet users’ own
purposes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Multivariate features are abundant in genomic and genetic stu-
dies. A central theme is to understand the differential relation-
ships among features and their contribution to gene functions
and phenotypes. For example, the gene expression variation can
be predicted using distinct sets of histone modiﬁcation levels in
gene function groups (Jung and Kim, 2012). The joint occupancy
of multiple transcription factors may change depending on the
genome context, such that differential regulatory modules are
observed and linked to distinct regulation mechanisms.
MRHMMs (Multivariate regression hidden Markov models
and the variantS) is based on the premise that biological factors

do not interact with each other in a uniform manner across the
genome. A regression hidden Markov model (rHMM), for ex-
ample, can be used to segment the genome or genes into groups
in each of which there is a unique relationship among biolo-
gical factors. In addition to rHMM, MRHMMs includes five
other hidden Markov model (HMM) variant structures that
can be alternatively applied to suit specific studies and data
characteristics.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

An HMM can be viewed as a mixture model in which the latent (hidden)
state has the Markov property. Given the number of states M, an
HMM is constructed by specifying the initial state probability, the
transition probability and the emission probability distribution. Let
0 = (01, . . . , OT) denote the observation of data at time points
[1, . . . , tT. The time points will correspond to genomic locations in our
setting. Let d E (d2, ...,dT) denote the distance of the two adjacent
observations, where dk = tk — [1,21 for k = 2, .. . , T, and let
q E ((11, . . . , qr) denote the hidden states of the HMM. The initial state
probability is denoted by :1 = (:11, . . . , JIM), where :1,- 2 P011 2 Si) and s,-
represents the ith state for i = l, . The transition probability from
state s,- at time t to state S, is denoted by ail-(t) = P(q,+1 = sjlq, = s,-, d,+1),
where t e {[1, . . . , tT}. See the Supplementary material for the details. Let
A,, t e {[1, . . . , tT} denote the transition probability matrix at time t, and
let A = {A1, ...,AT}.

Let b,(0,) = p(0,|q, = s,-, A) denote the emission probability distribu-
tion given state s,-, where A denotes a collection of parameters for the
emission probability distribution. The joint distribution p(0, qlA, A, :1) of
the HMM is then written as

T
mom. An?) = nq.bq.(01) Haliqxtwiroo. (1)
2:2
When the emission probability distribution is a mixture of K distribu-
tions, the last term in Equation (1) can be replaced by the following:

K
mot) = Z) u.,,-p(0,rq,. k. =1. A). (2)
1'21
where h, is the mixture component at time t, u,“- = P(h, =j|q,) for
(1,: l, ...,M,j=l, ...,Kandte{t1, ...,tT}.
When the observation 0, consists of explanatory and response vari-
ables, denoted by x, and y,, respectively, the last term in Equation (2) can
be further expressed as

p(xtaytIqtahta)“) =17thM, (It, ht, A)‘I7(xtl11tahta)h)a (3)

This model is more general than both the regular HMM and the
rHMM. The regular HMM has p(y,|x,,q,,).) = l and the rHMM has
p(xtIqtaA‘) = 1-

MRHMMs incorporates six different emission probability structures
by modifying Equation (3):

(1) [7(XtIIIt = SJ»)

(2) PU’tlxtalIt = S131) ‘I7(XtIIIt = Si, 1)

(3) PU’tIanIt = SJ»)

(4) Zj “017(xtI11t = Siaht =1)”

(5) Zj uijPUtIXtalIt = Siaht =1, A)‘I7(xtI11t= Si, ht :1, A)
(6) PU’tIanIt = S131) ‘ Z,- usz’(XtIIIt = Si, ht =1, A)

Within a state, the emission probability densities in Models 173 consist
of a single parametric distribution, while Models 4% consist of a mixture
of multiple distributions. Model 1 represents the regular HMM, Model 3
corresponds to rHMM and Model 2 incorporates information in both the
explanatory variables and their relationships with the response variables.
Models 4 and S can be considered as an extension of Models 1 and 2 to
non-parametric emission densities, i.e. the actual emission densities in
unknown distribution families are approximated by a mixture of para-
metric densities. Model 6 includes a single relationship between explana-
tory and response variables, whereas the explanatory variables are further
modeled non-parametrically using a mixture model.

The unknown parameters in MRHMMs, (n, A, A), are estimated using
the Baum7Welch algorithm (Baum et al., 1970). The hidden states are
estimated using the Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967) that ﬁnds the most
likely state sequence. The number of states is determined by Bayesian
Information Criterion.

The information of the model structure and options that a user would
like to build are carried through a text file, which we refer to as an input
ﬁle. The explanatory, response and location ﬁles are space-delimited and
need to be prepared separately. MRHMMs automatically generates five
output ﬁles whose names are indicated by the number of states and the
number of mixture components (if Models 4% are used). The output ﬁles
are the initial state and transition probabilities (hmm), the parameter
estimates of emission probability distributions (parm), the log likelihood
and the (posterior) state probabilities (loglike), the loglikelihood of each
independent run (RepLoglike) and the HMM states inferred by the
Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi). The details of input and output ﬁles and
available options are provided in the Supplementary material.

3 EXAMPLE

We present an application of MRHMMs to a genome-wide
study of the dynamics of GATA1 binding in erythroid cells in
mouse. To illustrate, we applied MRHMMs using Model 3
(rHMM) to segment the mouse (mm8) chromosome 7 using
the relationships between four explanatory variables:
H3K4me3, H3K27me3 (histone modiﬁcation levels), DNase I
hyper sensitivity and Tall occupancy, and one response variable:
GATAl occupancy. The data are generated by Wu et a]. (2011)
using the ChIP-seq technology. We used the log-transformed
maximums (log(x + 1)) over 1 000-bp non-overlapping windows
as the variables. We quantile normalized the explanatory vari-
ables and standardized the response variables. MRHMMs found
16 states as determined by Bayesian Information Criterion using
10 independent runs for each number of states M = 2 ~ 20. We
relabeled the states by an increasing order of the GATAl

Fig. 1. Regression coefﬁcients and the boxplots for GATAl occupancy
in 16 states identiﬁed by MRHMMs. Statistically insigniﬁcant regression
coefﬁcients are marked by X at or = .01 after the Bonferroni correction

averages in each state. The regression coefﬁcients and the box-
plots of GATA1 occupancy in each state are shown in Figure l.
The statistically insignificant regression coefﬁcients are marked
by ‘X’. It is observed that the last two states (states 15 and 16)
have notably high GATAl signals, and the genome segments in
these two states are the potential candidates of GATA1 binding
sites. The regression coefﬁcients of the two states suggest distinct
relationships between GATAl binding and the four explanatory
factors: state 15 demonstrates mild correlation but state 16 indi-
cates strong relationships. Based on the results from McLean et
a]. (2010), we found that state 15 is enriched with cis—regulatory
regions of genes related with hemoglobin complex, whereas state
16 is enriched with cytosolic part (Binom Raw P—Values are
8.6 x 10—8 and 4.8 x 10—8, respectively).

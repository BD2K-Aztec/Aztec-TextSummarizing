Inter-species pathway perturbation prediction

 

2 METHODS

In this section, we introduce the performance metrics used to rank pre-
dictions in the challenge, as well as the details of the methods developed
by Team49 and Teaml33.

2.1 Performance metrics used in SC3

The three metrics used to rank the predictions in all three sub-challenges
of the STC include the balanced accuracy (BAC), area under the preci-
sion-recall curve (AUPR) and the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient.
Although these metrics are described in detail elsewhere (thissorrakrai
et al., 2015), in this article we consider it relevant to discuss how these
metrics were implemented. In the ofﬁcial scoring methodology, predic-
tions for all pathways and test stimuli were pooled together, and then, the
three performance metrics were computed. This implementation is justi-
ﬁed considering that some individual pathways were activated in none or
too few stimuli in the test set to allow computation of AUPR and
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient. An alternative implementation expected
by some participating teams and feasible for BAC is to consider each
pathway individually and average the performance over the different
pathways. With such a mean BAC (mBAC) metric, ﬁnding the one stimu-
lus (out of 26) for which a pathway A is truly activated (100% sensitivity)
at the expense of a false positive (24/25 = 96% speciﬁcity) (scenario A)
would be rewarded more than an alternative scenario (B) in which one
predicts all pathways as inactive (0% sensitivity and 100% speciﬁcity).
The pooled BAC metric as well as AUPR and Pearson correlation coef-
ﬁcient would assess these two scenarios as equivalent. The majority of
human pathways was activated in less than two stimuli in the training
dataset (Table 1), making it difﬁcult to learn the relation between the
activation status of these human pathways and rat gene expression and/or
rat pathway activity. Although the mBAC metric results are reported in
this article to aid explaining why the direct method of Team49 was de-
signed in the way it was, and that the goal of improving pathway per-
turbation sensitivity for the most difﬁcult scenarios can be achieved, the
teams 49 and 133 fully recognize that the winner of this sub-challenge was
Team50.

2.2 Differential expression analysis and gene set
enrichment analysis used in SC3

The challenge organizers used existing methods to perform DE analysis
on the measured gene expression levels, and to perform gene set enrich-
ment analysis on the results. Raw expression values were processed and
normalized altogether using GCRMA (Wu et al., 2004). The LIMMA
package (Smyth, 2004) was used to compute pair-wise contrasts compar-
ing gene expression levels for individual stimulus (itwo to three repli-
cates) and gene expression levels for DME control (four replicates) in
both species. The output of this analysis was moderated t-values indicat-
ing the conﬁdence and direction of the stimulus-speciﬁc DE. To identify
enriched gene sets representative of speciﬁc pathways and biological pro-
cesses perturbed by each stimulus, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
was performed (Subramanian et al., 2005). As the original GSEA method
determines gene set signiﬁcance by sample permutations, which was un-
feasible here owing to a low number of samples, the challenge organizers
used an alternative version of GSEA (pre-ranked GSEA) that is based on
permutations of genes. The input in pre-ranked GSEA was the list of

genes ranked by moderated t-scores, and the output was normalized
enrichment scores (NES) and the associated false discovery rate (FDR)
for each gene set and each stimuli. These data were made available to all
SC3 participants, and our two methods, Team49 and Teaml33, used
LIMMA and GSEA as described above.

2.3 Approach of Team49

The ﬁrst submission of Team49 in this sub-challenge was based on a ma-
chine learning approach similar to the one we used previously (Tarca et al.,
2013a) in the IMPROVER Diagnostic Signature Challenge as well as in
the intra-species protein phosphorylation sub-challenge of STC (Dayarian
et al., 2014). In this approach, the NES for one or few rat pathways were
used as predictors in a linear discriminant analysis model that was ﬁt to
predict the activation status of one human pathway at a time. We con-
sidered that pathways that were not activated in four or more stimuli
should be predicted as inactive in the test stimuli, as there was not
enough information to train a model. This submission, referred to as
Team49_alt1 was later replaced with the one obtained with a different
method described below and referred to as Team49.

This second and ﬁnal submission was based on the idea of ﬁnding an
‘orthologous’ rat gene for each human gene by learning from the training
data. Then, for a given stimuli in the test set, the human expression data
were borrowed from the available rat test expression data via the orthol-
ogy mapping between human and rat genes. Human genes were subse-
quently ranked by moderated t-tests contrasting the stimuli-treated
samples with the DME-treated samples. Finally, GSEA was applied on
the ranked gene list to identify the pathways that were activated for the
given stimuli by testing whether the genes of a given pathway were
agglomerated toward the top or the bottom of the gene list. The proced-
ure can be detailed as a series of steps:

1. Use the collection of gene sets and pathways provided by the
organizers (c2.cp.v3.1.symbols.gmt ﬁle), and retain the 246 for
which predictions were required. From each pathway, drop the
genes not present on HG-U133 Plus2 array.

2. For each stimulus in the training set, compute the rank of each
gene based on the moderated t-scores computed from data of
stimuli- and DME-treated samples from the same batch. This
analysis is done for both human and rat training data. Let us
denote with Rank/Hand Rankr‘ithe rank that a given human
gene h and a given rat gene r received, respectively, for stimuli i.
The rank values are normalized so that 0 corresponds to the most
downregulated gene, whereas 1.0 corresponds to the most upre-
gulated gene. For each human gene h:

between the human gene h and all rat genes. The weight w,- is

b. Choose as ortholog for the human gene h the rat gene that
minimizes the D(h,r) distance deﬁned above.

The weight w above gives more importance to the rank differences
when the human gene is differentially expressed (rank far from
0.5) as opposed to when the human gene is not differentially ex-
pressed (rank closer to 0.5). This is because the ranks of genes that
are not differentially expressed are more likely to be affected by
noise than the genes ranked close to the top or to the bottom of
the list.

3. GSEAP is applied using the human genes ranked based on mod-
erated t-scores computed on expression data borrowed from the
rat ortholog genes.

An illustration of the approach used by Team49 is given in Figure 2.
The q-values for each pathway were converted into a ﬁnal activation
conﬁdence value as follows:

1. Conﬁdence = 1 if q-values<0.25
2. Conﬁdence = 0 if q-values>0.45

3. Conﬁdence is a linear function that decreases from 1 to 0 as
q-values increases from 0.25 to 0.45.

This q-values-to-conﬁdence levels conversion is different from the one
used by the organizers to infer pathway activity (Conﬁdence = 1 if
q-values<0.25, Conﬁdence = 0 otherwise), by attempting to increase
the sensitivity of the method at the expense of losing perhaps some spe-
ciﬁcity. Such a trade-off was expected to be meaningful in the context of a
BAC being computed for each pathway separately and then averaged
over all pathways (mBAC instead of pooled BAC).

2.4 Approach of Team133

The initial version of Teaml33’s method used linear regression models in
t-value space to predict human t-values from rat ones, and used GSEA to
identify perturbed pathways. As a ﬁrst step, we used the LIMMA pack-
age (Smyth, 2004) to test every human and rat gene for DE across the 26
training stimuli when compared with their control treatment. From this
analysis, we extracted the moderated t-values and called the resulting two
matrices t" for rat and [h for human. To level the differences in response
magnitude that various stimuli can induce, we standardized I" so that the
t-values for a given stimulus followed a distribution with mean 0 and SD
1. In our model, we represented the t-values of a human gene 1' as a linear
ﬁt of the t-values of some rat gene j, i.e. [:7 = ﬁt;- + at. The ﬁnal values for
the parameters j, at, )3 were then the ones minimizing the sum of squares
of the residuals of the linear regression model:

26
~ [7 r 2

mm t.— t-.—oz , 3

W  18,. ) ( )

where s iterates over the stimuli.

Given the set of test stimuli for which we had only rat expression, we
computed the t" matrix as described above. We then used the set of j, at, )3
parameters for all human genes to predict t”, the matrix of t-values. To
obtain NES and associated FDR of differentially expressed pathways for
every test stimulus, we applied GSEA pre-ranked by the corresponding
t-values from th. Our ﬁnal conﬁdence scores indicating signiﬁcantly per-
turbed pathways were then 1 7FDR.

The submission from the approach described above, referred to as
Teaml33_alt1, was later replaced with another submission referred to
as Teaml33. This second approach differed from the one described
above in that it used similarities between a test stimulus response and
the set of training stimuli responses. The motivating assumption was that
stimuli that shared a high number of differentially expressed genes also

perturbed the same pathways. Consequently, for a given test stimulus, we
wanted to upweight similar stimuli during the training phase.

To upweight certain stimuli during parameter learning, we used a
weighted regression and modiﬁed Equation 3 slightly to

26
51331} Z w; — m}. — a)? (4)
i ‘ .\‘=l

We now minimized the weighted sum of squares of the residuals of the
linear regression model, where the weights for a test stimulus test and a
training stimulus trains were deﬁned as the number of highly regulated
genes that they have in common plus a pseudo count

wx = |top100’m ﬂ top100’r“i"‘vl + l. (5)

Here top100 denotes the set of genes with the top 100 absolute t-values.

As opposed to the simpliﬁed approach described in the previous sec-
tion, where there was only one single parameter estimation step, this
weighted method required parameter estimation for every test stimulus
because of the test stimulus-dependent weight.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Performance of the direct methods in SC3

The performance metrics, AUPR, BAC and Pearson correlation
are presented in Figure 3 for all submissions to this sub—chal—
lenge. We also include some alternative submissions that were
either submitted before the challenge deadline but replaced later
with an updated submission (Team49_altl and Teaml33_alt1) or
submitted after the challenge deadline (Team111_altl) but still
before the release of the gold standard data (the true activation
status of the human pathways for the test stimuli). These alter—
native submissions included the following: (i) Teamlll_alt1, a
version of Teaml 1 1’s ofﬁcial submission including bug ﬁxes; (ii)
Team49_alt1, a machine learning—based approach of Team49
that was later replaced by the ofﬁcial Team49 submission; (0)
Teaml33_alt1, the unweighted approach introduced in Section
2.4. As Teaml 1 1’s challenge submission (Teaml 1 1) contained a
systematic error that led to a performance worse than random,
we decided to not comment on the results. However, we have
included the corrected method (Team111_altl) below.

As shown in Figure 3, according to the ofﬁcial ranking meth—
odology, the machine learning—based approaches (Team111_alt1,
Team50, Team49_alt1) consistently rank higher than the direct
methods that we have proposed (Teaml33, Team49).
Nevertheless, when considering the mBAC criteria (not used in
the ofﬁcial ranking) alone, the direct methods perform better
than most of their machine learning—based counterparts. The
pooled BAC of the top three machine learning methods
(Team111_alt1, Team50, Team49_alt1) was 0.55, on average,
whereas our direct methods achieved a 0.53. The mBAC was
0.505, on average, for machine learning and 0.52 for direct meth—
ods. The team with the highest mBAC (Team52) shows the high—
est balance between sensitivity and speciﬁcity, whereas the
highest ranking team based on the pooled BAC metric
(Team111_altl) shows a stronger bias toward speciﬁcity espe—
cially for pathways that are perturbed by only a few stimuli
(see Supplementary Fig Sl).

To evaluate how the different methods performed under the
most difﬁcult scenarios, we computed the BAC only for the
human pathways in the test dataset for which no activation

Fig. 4. Data-driven orthologs. The ranks of human gene ALOX5AP, rat
gene Casp4 and HGNC rat ortholog Alox5ap are standardized (0 most
down-, 1 most upregulated among all genes) and shown across all stimuli
(top). The moderated t-score for the human gene ALOX5AP is plotted
against the standardized t-score for rat genes Casp4, Alox5ap (bottom)

such criteria are influenced by several factors such as the quality
and identity of the gene sets and pathways considered, and by the
sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the GSEA analysis used to determine
pathway perturbation. In this section, however, we assess the
quality of gene pairs directly by using (i) the correlation of
their ranks between species across the same stimuli and (ii)
their ability to predict DE status of each other.

Both approaches, Team49 and Teaml33_alt1, were designed
to ﬁnd one rat gene that best mimics the activity of a given
human gene when cells are treated with stimuli from the training
dataset. As an example, although Team49 chose for the human
gene ALOX5AP the rat gene that had a similar rank across all
stimuli (Fig. 4, top), Teaml33 searched for the rat gene with the
highest linear correlation between its t—score and the human
t—score (bottom) and, for this case, both teams found the rat
gene Casp4 as the best match. Interestingly, the sequence—based
rat ortholog from the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee
(HGNC), Alox5ap, does not mimic the behavior of the human
counterpart for the 26 stimuli. Additional examples of correl—
ation plots between ranks of response ortholog genes are
shown for both training and test stimuli in Supplementary
Figures S2784. A signiﬁcant association of gene pairs rank cor—
relations between training and test sets was observed for all three

sets of orthologs (Team49, Teaml33_alt1 and seqence—based
from HGNC), as shown in Supplementary Figure SS. These
data suggest that the ortholog pairs learned on the training
data by the two direct methods do generalize to some extent
on the test data.

To determine how well the rat response orthologs predict DE
of individual human genes, we determined for each stimulus the
DE status based on a moderate t—test P—value 5 0.05and noted
the sign of the change. Then, for all gene pairs, we counted the
following instances: (i) the rat and the human genes are DE in
the same direction (true positive), (ii) the rat and the human
genes are not DE (true negative), (iii) the rat gene is DE but
the human gene is either not DE or changes in the opposite
direction (false positive), (iv) only the human gene is DE (false
negative). This allowed us to summarize performance metrics for
the different ortholog sets separately for training and test data.
Results are shown in Table 3. To be able to compare results with
the sequence—based orthologs (HGNC), we used only gene pairs
in this analysis, where the human gene had exactly one rat ortho—
log in HGNC. This requirement resulted in 11 540 gene pairs. We
have also generated 1 million random ortholog mappings and
show the results for the mapping with the highest sum of sensi—
tivity and specificity. Table 3 results indicate that all tested ortho—
log sets were better in predicting the DE status of human genes
than pairing genes at random. While Teaml33_alt1 had the high—
est training set performance, this mapping failed to generalize
and exhibited lower test set performance. The best overall per—
formance was observed for Team49 with a sensitivity of 0.19 on
the test set stimuli at 0.89 speciﬁcity.

To further assess the similarity of the two approaches, we
studied the overlap of rat genes found as orthologs for human
genes by the two direct methods. In this analysis, we focused on
the Teaml33_alt1 method, as the ofﬁcial submission of Teaml33
used test stimulus—dependent orthologs and is not suitable for
comparison with Team49’s method. A number of 410 humane
rat response orthologs were found in common between the two
teams (Supplementary Table S3) (p<1e — 13. However, for the
purpose of gene set analysis, this overlap is unnecessarily restrict—
ive. If, for example, a human pathway has two genes hA and hB
and one team found rat genes rD and rE as response orthologs,
respectively, but the other team found rat genes rE and rD as
response orthologs, respectively, the pathway enrichment ana—
lysis will be the same between teams. Therefore, in this additional
overlap analysis, we simply count the rat genes selected in
common by the two teams for a given human pathway. For
every pathway 1', we counted the number of common genes C,-

between the two methods as well as the probability to observe C ,-
genes or more just by chance. Of the 246 pathways, 43 had an
adjusted P—value<0.05 using the FDR adjustment method
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). To see whether the overlap
depends on the number of stimuli that a given pathway was
perturbed by, we performed a Fisher’s exact test based on the
contingency table: adjusted P—value<0.05; active in at least one
stimulus in human cells in either training or test set separately.
No signiﬁcant association (P>0.35) was found between the
number of active stimuli and the number of pathway with sig—
niﬁcant gene overlap between methods. These results suggest
that the response orthologs found by the two teams show a
level of similarity, and this was uniform across the pathways.
Finally, we have also performed a similar overlap analysis
between the data—driven orthologs found by the direct methods
and the list of orthologs from HGNC provided by the organizers
of the challenge. We could not ﬁnd a single gene set for which the
overlap between HGNC orthologs and data—driven orthologs
was signiﬁcant and hence concluded that the sequence—based
orthologs and expression proﬁle—based orthologs are different.

4 DISCUSSION

The Systems Biology Veriﬁcation IMPROVER Pathway perturb—
ation prediction challenge veriﬁed methods and concepts of inter—
species translation of pathway activity based on gene expression
data. In this work, we focused on the solutions of Team49 and
Teaml33, and put them in context of other submissions with the
goal of investigating their advantages and limitations. Given the
training data, both methods assigned one rat gene to each human
gene based on a similar response pattern across the training
stimuli. This orthology mapping is used to impute the missing
human gene expression values (Team49) or to predict the
t—values of DE tests in human from rat (Teaml33).

These two approaches are different in nature from another
category of methods used by other teams in this challenge,
namely, machine learning methods. These two categories of
methods (direct methods versus machine learning methods) can
be seen as a different sequence of two basic steps: gene set ana—
lysis and inference from rat data to human data. The machine
learning—based methods require that a gene set analysis method is
applied first and then inference of the pathway activation status
from rat to human is learned. In contrast, direct methods that are
the subject of this article perform the rat to human inference ﬁrst
and then apply the gene set analysis step. Therefore, one can see
that mapping pathway activity from rat to human accomplished
by the machine learning methods is dependent on the particular
pathway analysis method used. This might be problematic be—
cause a given pathway may or may not appear to be activated by
a given stimulus depending on the sensitivity and specificity of
the gene set analysis method that was applied [see Tarca et al.
(2013b) for a comparison of different methods]. In contrast, the
rat—to—human inferences made by the direct methods are inde—
pendent of the particular gene set analysis method that is
involved, and they produce a correspondence between human
and rat genes. This correspondence identiﬁes rat genes thought
to be under similar regulatory control in humans for the given
type of cells and stimuli used in the experiments. The data—driven
orthologs found by the direct methods predicted inter—species

differential gene expression better than sequence—based orthologs
and were signiﬁcantly overlapping between the two methods; yet,
they were divergent from sequence—based orthologs extracted
from HGNC database.

Based on the three performance metrics (AUPR, Pearson cor—
relation and BAC) computed by pooling predictions and gold
standard over all pathways and stimuli, the top three teams
would be Teaml 1 1_alt1, Team50 and Team49_alt1, all machine
learning methods. One could argue that this pooling of predic—
tions favors methods that do not deal with the most difficult
scenarios, i.e. with pathway activation inference for those path—
ways that were seldom or never activated in the training dataset,
and simply predict these pathways as non—activated. An alterna—
tive would be to compute the performance metrics per pathway
and then average over the 246 pathways; however, this is not
feasible for AUPR and the correlation coefficient but is for BAC.
Therefore, we compared the rankings of the machine learning
methods with the ones of the direct methods based on the BAC
alone computed as in the ofﬁcial challenge (pooled) and also per
pathway and then averaged (mBAC). The pooled BAC was con—
sistently higher for top three machine learning methods than for
our direct methods. However, on average, our direct methods
have a higher mBAC than the top three machine learning
methods.

The inability of machine learning methods to predict the acti—
vation status of pathways that were never activated in the train—
ing dataset is reﬂected in the sensitivity of analysis restricted to
those pathways. None of the top three methods, all machine
learning based, produced a single true positive for these path—
ways. However, the direct method of Teaml33 achieved a sensi—
tivity of 0.29 at speciﬁcity 0.99, (BAC = 0.64) and Team49
achieved a sensitivity of 0.29 at speciﬁcity 0.96 (BAC = 0.62).
Machine learning methods define a stimuli effect on a given
pathway into classes (activation versus non—activation), and
hence require one or more instances of activations to work. An
alternative machine learning approach around this issue is to
transform the classiﬁcation problem into a regression problem,
as Team52 did, and use a continuous form of the pathway ac—
tivity evidence (combination of NES scores and FDR values) in a
regression model that can be ﬁt regardless of the number of
activation cases for a given pathway. Team52 had the highest
mBAC statistics computed over all pathways, yet this method
did not ﬁnd any true positive for the zero activation pathways in
the training dataset. A second alternative discussed in this issue
by Team50 (Hormoz et al., 2014) would be to cluster pathways
into groups and hence borrow activation information across
pathways. However, from the outset, such an approach did not
appear to be outperforming the methodology used by Team50
for their ofﬁcial submission in this challenge.

The task of using transcriptomics data in rat to infer pathway
activity in human for a given stimuli proved to be challenging
regardless of the approach that was used to tackle this problem.
Compared with the task of predicting protein phosphorylation
status in human based on gene expression and phosphorylation
data in rat (sub—challenge SC2), the prediction of pathway activ—
ity (sub—challenge SC3) was much more difﬁcult, with the best
pooled BAC in SC2 being 0.77 compared with 0.56 in SC3. There
may be several reasons for this, one of which being the fact that
in the human training data only few outcomes are positives (6%

 

507

ﬁm'spzumofpiqxo'sopeuuopuoiq/ﬁdnq

C.Hafemeister et al.

 

of the pathway—stimulus combinations), which was not the case
in SC2. A second reason for this apparent difﬁculty is that, by
deﬁnition, the pathway activation status is dependent on tens or
hundreds of member genes, and the call of whether a pathway is
perturbed is dependent on the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the
gene set analysis method usediin this case pre—ranked GSEA.

More work would be needed to determine whether the use of
more sensitive and more speciﬁc pathway analysis methods
(Tarca et al., 2013b), such as MRGSE (Michaud et al., 2008),
or the use of more relevant gene sets based on conserved co—
regulated genes (Waltman et al., 2010) can lead to improved
translation of pathway activity from rat to human.

Abstract

Summary: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play central roles in many biological processes.
Consequently, an accurate description of the disordered state is an important step towards a com—
prehensive understanding of a number of important biological functions. In this work we describe
a new web server, Mollack, for the automated construction of unfolded ensembles that uses both
experimental and molecular simulation data to construct models for the unfolded state. An import—
ant aspect of the method is that it calculates a quantitative estimate of the uncertainty in the con—
structed ensemble, thereby providing an objective measure of the quality of the final model.
Overall, Mollack facilitates structure—function studies of disordered proteins.

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) constitute a class of biopoly—
mers that sample a diverse set of conformations during their biolo—
gical lifetime. Constructing a structural model for an IDP requires
that one specify a representative set of structures that capture, at a
low resolution, the dominant thermally accessible states of the pro—
tein. IDP Ensemble construction, albeit challenging, is an essential
step towards a comprehensive understanding of the function of these
biopolymers (Tompa and Varadi, 2014).

data (Varadi et (11., 2014). Despite these advances it is important to
recognize that the ensemble construction problem itself is inherently
degenerate because the number of degrees of freedom in the protein
is generally much larger than the number of experimental con—
straints (Fisher et (11., 2010). A consequence of this is that there may

that agrees with a pre—specified set of experimental data (Fisher
et (11., 2010, 2012). A key aspect of the method is that it also calcu—
lates an ‘uncertainty parameter’, 0 S a S 1, which quantifies the
uncertainty in the underlying ensemble. When a : 0, it is likely that
the model is correct, and when a : 1 one has little certainty that the
constructed ensemble is correct. Nevertheless, when (7 9E 0 one can
generate confidence intervals for ensemble average quantities that
provide a rigorous framework for hypothesis testing. Mollack is an
online implementation of this Bayesian formalism for constructing
ensembles for IDPs.

2 The Mollack Server

The ensemble construction process begins with a structural library
consisting of a set of energetically favorable conformations that cap—
ture, albeit at low resolution, dominant thermally accessible states
of the protein. Since a number of methods exist for generating mod—
els of the unfolded state (Jha et (11., 2005; Marsh and Forman—Kay,
2009; Ozenne et (11., 2012), users are encouraged to upload a pre—
generated structural library. However, the user must ensure that the
associated structure files are in pdb format and that the structures
do not contain bad contacts. Alternatively, users can ask Mollack to
generate a library of low energy conformations using only the amino
acid sequence of the protein using either GROMACS (Berendsen
et (11., 1995) or CHARMM (Brooks et (11., 2009)—although an aca—
demic CHARMM license is needed to use the latter algorithm.

If the user chooses to have Mollack generate their structural li—
brary, the algorithm will run replica—exchange simulations, using
implicit solvent, to generate a diverse set of low energy structures.
Default settings utilize a Generalized Born implicit solvent model
(Bashford and Case, 2000) with GROMACS and EEF1 (Lazaridis
and Karplus, 1999) with CHARMM. In addition, CHARMM simu—
lations can also employ a biasing potential to ensure that the protein
samples states that have different amounts of ﬁ—sheet and ot—helix
content (Gurry and Stultz, 2014). A user can generate different
structural libraries by changing the simulation protocol using the
advanced options tab. Generating a structural library is the most
labor—intensive part of a Mollack run. GROMACS generation takes
20—80 h, depending on the size of the protein (~20 to 150 residues)
and CHARMM generation, using the standard parameters, takes
5—20 h. While both simulation methods generate qualitatively simi—
lar results, the main difference between the two approaches is that
CHARMM runs require less time. This is largely due to the fact that
runs with the EEF1 implicit solvent model are faster than runs with
the Generalized Born model. Currently, automated structure gener—
ation is limited to proteins that are at most 150 residues and runs
that last at most 5—days. If more computational resources are
required, the user should pre—generate a structural library using an—
other online tool (mentioned above) and upload those data to
Mollack.

Once the structural library is specified, Mollack uses a user—gen—
erated experimental data, to assign weights to the resulting struc—
tures. The experimental data file contains all the experimental
measurements, organized by residue, that Mollack will use to build
the ensemble. Currently the method can utilize NMR chemical
shifts, J—couplings, and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) for ensem—
ble construction. If information is available on the average radius of
gyration, this can be utilized as well. A description of the correct for—
mat to use is found on the Data page of the website, as well as an op—
tion to either build a blank template from the user’s primary
sequence or build a template that incorporates NMR data from the

Biological magnetic Resonance Data Bank (Ulrich et (11., 2008).
Example experimental data files are also provided in the
Supplementary data. Future updates to the website will expand the
set of available data that the method can exploit.

Mollack clusters structures from the generated structural library
to reduce the overall ensemble size down to a manageable number
(e.g. typically between 300 and 500 structures). The centroids of
each cluster are then used as input to our previously described
Variational Bayesian Weighting (VBW) algorithm, which constructs
weights for each structure (Fisher et (11., 2010, 2012). The output
consists of the structures, their weights, the uncertainty parameter (a
portion of the Mollack output is shown in Fig. 1), and additional
Dirichlet coefficients that can be used to calculate confidence inter—
vals for ensemble average properties. Additionally, ensemble fit stat—
istics are provided, allowing the user to see how well the generated
ensemble agrees with the experimental data.

3 Conclusions

We have implemented a web—based tool for the construction of en—
sembles that model intrinsically disordered proteins. An advantage
of the method is that it generates quantitative estimates of the under—
lying uncertainty in the final model, thereby facilitating rigorous hy—
pothesis testing of observations arising from the model.

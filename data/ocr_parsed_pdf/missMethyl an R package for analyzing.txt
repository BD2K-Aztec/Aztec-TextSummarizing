Abstract

Summary: DNA methylation is one ofthe most commonly studied epigenetic modifications due to
its role in both disease and development. The lllumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip is a cost—
effective way to profile >450 000 Cst across the human genome, making it a popular platform for
profiling DNA methylation. Here we introduce missMethyl, an R package with a suite of tools for
performing normalization, removal of unwanted variation in differential methylation analysis, dif—
ferential variability testing and gene set analysis for the 450K array.

Availability and implementation: missMethyl is an R package available from the Bioconductor pro—

 

ject at www.bioconductor.org.

1 Introduction

DNA methylation, one of the most widely studied epigenetic modifi-
cations, is crucial for normal embryonic development and is often
disrupted in disease. Epigenetic marks can be modified by environ-
mental exposures and are dramatically altered in cancer. Since epi-
genetic changes are potentially reversible, DNA methylation is an
attractive therapeutic target and remains an important area of
research.

There are several array and sequencing-based technologies available
for profiling DNA methylation. While sequencing costs have declined, it
remains expensive for large DNA methylation studies, making arrays a
cost-effective alternative. Illumina’s HumanMethylation450 (450K)
BeadChip is currently the most popular platform, having been used in
many large studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, as well as in
many epigenome-wide association studies.

Here, we present the missMethyl R package, which contains
dedicated tools for performing a range of analyses primarily targeted
at 450K arrays. These methods include normalization, removal
of unwanted variation (RUV) such as batch effects in a differential
methylation analysis, differential variability testing and gene set ana-
lysis. Software packages for reading in raw data, pre-processing and

differential methylation analysis include minfi (Aryee et (11., 2014),
niethleit (Akalin et (11., 2012) and methylumi. However,
missMethyl provides more specialized analysis methods not avail-
able elsewhere.

2 Methods

2.1 SWAN: subset—quantile within array normalization
SWAN (Maksimovic et (11., 2012) is a within-array normalization
method specifically designed for the 450K platform. The 450K array
uses a combination of two distinct probe types, Infinium I and II,
which are known to display technical differences. The underlying as-
sumption of SWAN is that probes with the same number of Cst in
their probe bodies share similar biology. Thus, their overall intensity
distributions should be similar regardless of design type.

The SWAN function takes an object of class MethylSet,
RGChannelSet or MethyLumiSet and performs normalization in
two steps. First, a subset of Infinium I and II probes that have one,
two and three underlying Cst are randomly selected and quantile
normalized, keeping the methylated and unmethylated channels

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Gene expression profiling has shown great potential in
outcome prediction for different types of cancers. Nevertheless, small
sample size remains a bottleneck in obtaining robust and accurate
classifiers. Traditional supervised learning techniques can only work
with labeled data. Consequently, a large number of microarray data
that do not have sufficient follow-up information are disregarded. To
fully leverage all of the precious data in public databases, we turned
to a semi-supervised learning technique, low density separation
(LDS).

Results: Using a clinically important question of predicting
recurrence risk in colorectal cancer patients, we demonstrated that
(i) semi-supervised classification improved prediction accuracy as
compared with the state of the art supervised method SVM, (ii)
performance gain increased with the number of unlabeled samples,
(iii) unlabeled data from different institutes could be employed after
appropriate processing and (iv) the LDS method is robust with regard
to the number of input features. To test the general applicability of this
semi-supervised method, we further applied LDS on human breast
cancer datasets and also observed superior performance. Our results
demonstrated great potential of semi-supervised learning in gene
expression-based outcome prediction for cancer patients.

1 INTRODUCTION

A major challenge in clinical cancer research is the prediction
of prognosis at the time of tumor discovery. Accurate outcome
prediction can help guide the selection of appropriate therapy for
each individual patient. For example, if patients can be accurately
assigned to a ‘low-risk’ or a ‘high-risk’ subgroup based on whether
the disease would relapse within a certain amount of time after
tumor resection, adjuvant chemotherapy (CTX) can be administered
to high-risk patients, while low-risk patients might forgo this toxic
treatment. Microarray-based gene expression proﬁling has showed
great potential in outcome prediction for different types of cancers
(Bild et (11., 2006; Chibon et (11., 2010; Crijns et (11., 2009; Gentles
et (11., 2010; Goetz et (11., 2007; Kim et (11., 2009; Mok et (11., 2009;

2002; Wang et (11., 2005). Nevertheless, small sample size remains
a bottleneck in obtaining robust and accurate prediction models
(Dupuy and Simon, 2007; Ein-Dor et (11., 2006). The number of
samples in microarray-based cancer studies is usually small because
microarray experiments are time consuming, expensive and limited
by sample availability. For outcome prediction, sample size is further
reduced signiﬁcantly by the availability of follow-up data for the
analyzed samples. In fact, in publicly available gene expression
databases such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), only a small
fraction of human-tumor gene expression datasets provide clinical
follow-up data.

Gene-expression data-based outcome prediction usually relies on
traditional supervised learning techniques, in which only labeled
data (i.e. data from samples with clinical follow-up) can be
used for learning, while unlabeled data (i.e. data from samples
without clinical follow-up) are disregarded. Recent studies in
machine learning suggest that unlabeled data, when used in
conjunction with limited amount of labeled data, can produce
considerable improvement in learning accuracy, a technique called
semi-supervised learning (Chapelle et (11., 2008). Indeed, semi-
supervised learning has proved to be effective in solving different
biological problems including protein classiﬁcation (Weston et (11.,
2005), peptide identiﬁcation in shotgun proteomics (Kall et (11.,
2007), prediction of transcription factor—gene interaction (Ernst
et (11., 2008) and gene expression-based cancer subtype discovery
(Bair and Tibshirani, 2004; Koestler et (11., 2010; Steinfeld et (11.,
2008). Because semi-supervised learning is able to use a large
number of unlabeled microarray data in conjunction with some
labeled data, we hypothesize that this technique can be used to
improve gene expression-based classiﬁcation of human cancer.

Different algorithms for semi-supervised classiﬁcation have been
proposed (Belkin and Niyogi, 2004; Blum and Mitchell, 1998;
Chapelle and Zien, 2005; Chapelle et (11 ., 2008; Johnson and Zhang,
2007; Rigollet, 2007; Wang and Shen, 2007), and many successful
algorithms directly or indirectly rely on the assumption that the
decision boundary should not cross high density regions but lie
in low density regions (usually called ‘cluster assumption’). This
can be illustrated by comparing the well-known support vector
machines (SVM) to its semi-supervised extension, Transductive
SVM (TSVM) (Joachims, 1999). The goal of a standard SVM is to
maximize the margin around the decision boundary of the labeled
data to enable robust classiﬁcation. In a TSVM, in addition to the
original goal of SVM, unlabeled data are used to guide the boundary
away from dense regions by ﬁnding a hyperplane that is far away
from the unlabeled data points. Finding the exact TSVM solution
is NP-hard. Therefore, several approximation algorithms have been

Xiang et (11., 2010; Xu et (11., 2010).

In this article, we aimed to develop and evaluate semi-supervised
classiﬁers for human cancers based on one of the most successful
semi-supervised classiﬁcation method, low density separation
(LDS) (Chapelle and Zien, 2005). We started with the prediction
of relapse-free survival for Stage I through III colorectal cancer
(CRC) patients based on gene expression proﬁles of primary
tumors. Colorectal carcinoma is the third most commonly occurring
noncutaneous carcinoma and the second leading cause of cancer-
related deaths in the USA. Although clinical trials have showed
clear beneﬁt of adjuvant CTX for Stage III patients, 40—44% of
Stage III patients enrolled in ‘surgery-only’ groups did not recur
in 5 years even without adjuvant treatment. On the other hand,
while clinical trials have failed to show the beneﬁt of adjuvant
CTX when applied to unselected Stage II patients, some studies
suggest that a subset of high-risk Stage II patients may beneﬁt from
adjuvant therapy. Moreover, although the standard treatment for
Stage I patients requires no adjuvant treatment after surgery, about
10% of Stage I cancer will recur (Gray et (11., 2007; Lu et (11 ., 2009).
Therefore, an accurate and reliable method that identiﬁes high-risk
Stages I and II patients and low-risk Stage III patients could improve
the selection of individualized therapy.

Using ﬁve CRC gene expression datasets from the GEO database,
we demonstrated that, (i) Semi-supervised classiﬁcation improved
prediction accuracy as compared with the state of the art supervised
method SVM, (ii) performance gain increased with the number of
unlabeled samples, (iii) unlabeled data from different institutes could
be employed after appropriate processing and (iv) the LDS method is
robust with regard to the number of input features. To test the general
applicability of the semi-supervised method, we further applied it on
human breast cancer datasets and demonstrated superior accuracy
as compared with SVM.

2 METHODS

2.1 Gene expression datasets

Five CRC gene expression datasets were downloaded from the GEO database
(Table 1). Stage IV samples were excluded from this study. Overlapping
samples in GSE17536 and GSE14333 were removed from GSE14333.
Remaining samples were assigned to the ‘recurrence’ group if recurrence
was observed within 5 years of follow-up and the ‘nonrecurrence’ group
if recurrence was not observed within 5 years of follow-up. Samples with

insufﬁcient or no clinical follow-up data were assigned to the ‘unlabeled’
group. Distribution of samples in these three groups is listed in Table 1 for
each dataset. In this study. part or all of labeled samples from GSE17536
in combination with varied numbers of unlabeled samples were used for
training. whereas the labeled samples from GSE14333 were used for
independent validation.

Two breast cancer gene expression datasets were downloaded from GEO
and the samples were classiﬁed into the ‘recurrence’ and ‘non-recurrence’
groups as described above (Table 1). Semi-supervised classiﬁers were
built based on GSE2034 through randomly removing labels from different
proportions of samples and then tested on the independent GSE2990 dataset.

All CRC datasets were generated on the Affymetrix U133 plus 2.0 array.
whereas the three breast cancer datasets were generated on the Affymetrix
U133A array. Cel ﬁles for the datasets were processed using MAS5 followed
by quantile normalization. Training and validation datasets were processed
separately to ensure the independency of the validation datasets. For training
datasets. probe sets were ﬁrst ranked based on average gene expression value
and the bottom 30% with the lowest values were eliminated to rule out genes
that were likely to be unexpressed. Remaining probe sets were ranked based
on coefﬁcient of variance and the bottom 30% were eliminated to remove
genes with very low variation. To make expression level comparable across
genes. expression values for each gene were standardized using a z-score
transformation.

2.2 Low density separation approach

The LDS algorithm is based on the cluster assumption. It implements two
effective procedures to place the decision boundary in low density regions
between clusters. First. it derives graph-based distances that emphasize low
density regions. Second. it uses a gradient descent approach to optimize the
TSVM objective function in order to ﬁnd a decision boundary that avoids
high density regions. By combining these two procedures. LDS achieves
clearly superior accuracy compared to the supervised method SVM and other
state of the art semi-supervised methods on several test datasets (Chapelle
and Zien, 2005). More details of the LDS algorithm can be found in the
original article (Chapelle and Zien, 2005).

2.3 Evaluation of LDS and SVM predictions

A Matlab implementation available from http://olivier.chapelle.cc/lds was
used for LDS and an R implementation of a Library for Support Vector
Machine (LIBSVM) available in the e1071 package was used for SVM.
SVM has two parameters C and y. where C is the soft margin parameter
and y is the parameter for the radial basis kernel function. LDS has several
parameters. but we only considered two most critical ones C and p. where
C is the soft margin parameter and p is a softening parameter for graph
distance computation. Default values were used for other parameters. For
the parameters to be tuned. we let each of them vary among the candidate set
{10_3, 104, 10‘1 , 10‘0, 101, 102} to form different parameter combinations.
Each combination of parameter choices was evaluated using stratiﬁed 5-
fold cross-validation. and the parameters with best cross-validation AUC
[the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve] were
identiﬁed. The ﬁnal classiﬁer model was then trained on the whole training
set using the optimal parameters. tested on the independent validation dataset.
and evaluated based on both AUC and accuracy.

normalized. z-score transformed. and then separated into labeled data and
unlabeled data. A stratiﬁed K-fold cross-validation is used for classiﬁer
development. Features are selected based on labeled data. whereas LDS
classiﬁer is developed by combining labeled and unlabeled data. Fully
developed classiﬁer based on the optimal parameters identiﬁed in cross-
validation is then evaluated in an independent dataset.

cross-validation is used for classiﬁer development. Speciﬁcally, the
labeled samples are randomly partitioned into K subsets, with each
subset containing roughly the same proportions of the two types
of class labels. Of the K subsets, a single subset is retained as a
temporary test subset and the remaining K — 1 subsets are used as a
temporary training set. On the training set, a feature selection method
is used to select a group of outcome-related genes. Although different
methods can be used for feature selection, the most commonly used
method, t-test, was employed in this study. Data on selected genes
for samples in the training set is combined with those for unlabeled
samples and used to parameterize the LDS classiﬁcation algorithm.
The pararneterized classiﬁer (yellow circle) is then used to classify
samples in the test subset. The cross-validation process is then
repeated K times, with each of the K subsets used exactly once as the
test subset. The K results from the subsets then can be combined to
produce a single estimation. Fully developed classiﬁer (green circle)
based on the optimal parameters identiﬁed by the cross-validation
process is then validated by an independent dataset. The performance
is evaluated based on both accuracy and AUC.

3.2 Integrating unlabeled data from the same dataset
improves prediction performance

In a cancer gene expression dataset, it is common that only some
of the samples have sufﬁcient clinical follow-up data and others are
unlabeled with regard to the clinical question of interest. Therefore,
we ﬁrst investigated whether integrating unlabeled data from the
same dataset could improve prediction performance using 5-year
relapse-free survival in CRC as an example. GSE17536 was used
for classiﬁer development, in which 66 samples were labeled (30
recurrence and 36 nonrecurrence) and 72 samples were unlabeled.
Of them, twenty three labeled samples in GSE14333 were used
for independent validation (12 recurrence and 11 nonrecurrence).
For reference, we compared performance from the semi-supervised
method LDS to that from the state of the art supervised method SVM.
To simulate different numbers and percentages of labeled samples
in different datasets, we performed comparisons for three different
sizes of labeled samples, 20, 40 and 66. For LDS, unlabeled samples
were added at two different ratios. For each combination, results
were generated for ﬁve random samples when possible in order
to obtain robust performance evaluation results. For each random
sample, t-test was used for feature selection with a cutoff value of
P=0.05.

Figure 2 (a—b) depicts the average AUC and accuracy of LDS
and SVM classiﬁers from the cross-validation studies. For sample
size of 20, LDS achieved 1.9 and 11.7% increase in AUC and 1.7
and 13.6% increase in accuracy as compared with SVM when 20
(1:1) or 72 (123.6) unlabeled samples were added, respectively. For
sample size of40, 9.4 and 13.9% increase in AUC and 8.7 and 13.4%

increase in accuracy were achieved when 40 (1:1) or 72 (1:1.8)
unlabeled samples were added, respectively. For sample size of
66, 15.5% increase in AUC and 11.8% increase in accuracy were
achieved when 72 (1:1.1) unlabeled samples were added. These
ﬁgures also show small variance across the ﬁve random samples
for each combination, suggesting the robustness of the evaluation
results.

Using parameters selected based on cross-validation results, ﬁill
models were developed based on all available data in GSE17536
(66 labeled and 72 unlabeled) and tested on the independent dataset
GSE14333. The LDS classiﬁer achieved an AUC of 0.55, which
was 21% higher than that from the SVM classiﬁer. Similarly, the
LDS classiﬁer obtained an accuracy of 0.52, which was 8.3% higher
than that from the SVM classiﬁer. Both cross-validation results
and independent test results clearly demonstrated that LDS was
able to integrate unlabeled data from the same dataset and achieve
signiﬁcantly better performance.

3.3 LDS is robust to the number of selected features

We used the t-test for feature selection and applied various cutoff
values. The number of features selected depended on the cutoff used.
In order to evaluate the robustness of LDS to the number of selected
features, we tested different P-value cutoffs including 0.01, 0.05 and
0.1. From GSE17536, 40 randomly selected labeled samples and 72
unlabeled samples were used for the stratiﬁed 5-fold cross-validation
analysis, and results were generated for ﬁve random samples and
averaged.

According to both AUC and accuracy, performance based on
the P-value cutoffs 0.05 and 0.1 were very similar, whereas that
based on the cutoff 0.01 was slightly worse (Fig. 3). However, the
performance decrease between the 0.05 cutoff and the 0.01 cutoff
was only 5.2% based on AUC and 5.5% based on accuracy. These
results suggest that LDS was reasonably robust to the number of
selected features with different P-value cutoffs. Because the 0.05
cutoff seemed to perform slightly better than its looser or more
stringent alternatives, we continued the study using the 0.05 cutoff.

3.4 Integrating unlabeled data from different datasets
improves prediction performance

Although there exists many gene expression datasets from different
institutions in the public databases for many cancer type, very few
datasets provide clinical follow-up information. Therefore, it is of
particular interest to investigate whether integrating labeled data
with unlabeled data from different datasets can lead to improved
prognosis, and how performance changes with increased number of
unlabeled samples.

In addition to the two datasets used above (GSE17536 and
GSE14333), we further collected three CRC datasets (GSE13294,
GSE18105 and the CRC data in GSE2109) from the GEO database
(Table 1). Similar to the above analysis, we kept GSE14333 as
an independent test dataset and integrated the other four datasets
for classiﬁer development. A total of 662 samples in the four
datasets were processed using the MAS5 algorithm followed by
quantile normalization, removal of lowly expressed probe sets
and removal of probe sets with low variation. Because strong
batch effect was observed between different datasets, a gene-wise
z-score transformation was applied to each dataset separately, that
successfully reduced the batch effect (Supplementary Figure S1).
After data processing, 40 labeled samples were randomly selected
from the GSE17536 dataset. Unlabeled samples were added to
achieve different ratios between labeled and unlabeled samples (1:1,
1:4, 1:8, 1:12, 1:15). The t-test was used for feature selection with a
cutoff value of P = 0.05. Semi-supervised classiﬁers were developed
through stratiﬁed 5-fold cross-validation, and then evaluated using
the 23 labeled samples in the GSE14333 dataset. For each ratio,
the process was repeated ﬁve times and performance results were
averaged.

As shown in Figure 4, improvement in AUC and accuracy on
independent validation set was observed with increased number
of unlabeled samples. The AUC and accuracy were 0.57 and
0.55, respectively with 40 labeled and 596 unlabeled samples
(1:15), which were 14 and 10% higher than those with 40 labeled
and 40 unlabeled samples (1:1). Compared with the performance

of SVM with 66 labeled samples (Fig. 2), LDS achieved 26%
higher AUC and 14% higher accuracy with 40 labeled and 596
unlabeled samples. These results demonstrated that unlabeled data
from different datasets could help improve prediction performance,
and the improvement coincided with increased number of unlabeled
samples.

3.5 LDS is effective in breast cancer datasets

To test the general applicability of this semi-supervised method,
we applied the LDS procedure to human breast cancer datasets.
A breast cancer dataset GSE2034 with 275 samples was used to
develop classiﬁers for the prediction of 5-year recurrence. About
thirty labeled samples were randomly selected as labeled samples
while all other samples were treated as unlabeled samples. Similar
to the observation in colon cancer, the semi-supervised prediction
performance was robust to the number of selected features when
different P-value cutoffs were tested (Supplementary Figure S2).
Therefore, we used the 0.05 cutoff in the following studies. Semi-
supervised classiﬁers were developed through stratiﬁed 5-fold cross-
validation, and then evaluated using 158 labeled samples in an
independent dataset GSE2990. This process was repeated ﬁve times
and performance results were averaged.

In cross-validation studies, LDS achieved 16.3 and 20% increase
in accuracy as compared with SVM when 30 (1:1) and 245 (1:8.1)
unlabeled samples were added respectively (Fig. 5b). When AUC
was used as the performance metric, 2.2 and 7.45% increase were
observed as compared with SVM when 30 and 245 unlabeled
samples were added, respectively (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, the
accuracy and AUC obtained by SVM with 275 labeled samples
was only 1.5 and 2.6% higher than that by LDS with 30 labeled

and 245 unlabeled samples, suggesting great potential of the
semi-supervised method.

Applying the full model developed by LDS with 30 labeled and
245 unlabeled samples on the independent validation set GSE2990
resulted in an accuracy of 0.62, which was 14.8% higher than that
obtained by SVM with 30 labeled samples and was comparable
with that obtained by SVM with 275 labeled samples (Fig. 5d).
However, signiﬁcant gain in accuracy did not translate into superior
AUC (Fig. 5c).

To test whether integrating unlabeled data from different datasets
could improve prediction performance in breast cancer, we used an
additional dataset GSE20271 with 178 samples (Table 1). We kept
GSE2990 as an independent test dataset and integrated GSE2034
and GSE20271 for classiﬁer development. After data processing
as described in the CRC study, 30 labeled samples were randomly
selected from the GSE2034 dataset. Unlabeled samples were added
to achieve different ratios between labeled and unlabeled samples
(1: 1, 1:5, 1: 10, 1:14). The t-test was used for feature selection with a
cutoff value of P = 0.05. Semi-supervised classiﬁers were developed
through stratiﬁed 5-fold cross-validation, and then evaluated using
the 158 labeled samples in the GSE2990 dataset. For each ratio,
the process was repeated ﬁve times and performance results were
averaged.

As shown in Figure 6, improvement in AUC and accuracy on
independent validation set was observed with increased number
of unlabeled samples. These results were consistent with the
observations in CRC and further demonstrated that unlabeled data
from different datasets could help improve prediction performance.

4 DISCUSSION

The present study was designed to address the small sample
size problem in gene expression-based outcome prediction for
human cancers. As compared with SVM, the semi-supervised LDS

approach successﬁilly employed unlabeled gene expression data and
achieved signiﬁcantly better performance.

Previous studies in the machine learning ﬁeld suggest that
unlabeled data do not always help improve the performance
(Cozman and Cohen, 2002). If labeled data and unlabeled data
follow different distributions, integrating unlabeled data may even
lead to worse performance. This is a big concern for integrating
datasets from different institutes, as these datasets are likely to follow
different distributions because of both biological and technical
reasons. In our analysis, we used quantile normalization to make
distributions for all samples comparable. However, an unsupervised
clustering analysis suggested that strong batch effect remained after
this step (Supplementary Figure S 1 A). Further application of a gene-
wise z-score transformation to each dataset separately, effectively
reduced the batch effect (Supplementary Figure SlB). Without these
data preprocessing steps, LDS was not able to achieve improved
performance (data not shown). It is possible that more advanced
data preprocessing (Johnson et (11., 2007) might further improve the
LDS performance.

Cross-validation provides an estimate of the expected prediction
error for the classiﬁer developed using the full dataset. We performed
gene selection from scratch within each loop of the cross-validation
to avoid overestimation of the performance. Moreover, we also
repeated the 5-fold cross-validation for ﬁve times when possible to
obtain a more robust estimation. However, when a fully developed
model was applied on an independent data, the performance was
notably worse than that estimated, based on cross-validation. This
was true for both LDS and SVM classiﬁers, and performance
degradation was more severe in the CRC study than the breast cancer
study. Indeed, SVM performed worse than random (AUC < 0.5 and
accuracy <0.5) on the independent test set in the CRC study. One
explanation is the different class proportions between the training
and the independent test datasets, given the small sample size in
both datasets. Previously, it has been reported that varying class
proportions in training and test datasets can lead to pessimistic
biases for both accuracy and AUC, and this problem is common in
microarray studies with small sample size and weak signals (Parker
et (11., 2007). Although the class proportion can be well maintained
in a stratiﬁed cross-validation, it is not controlled for independent
test sets. Another explanation is the biological difference between
different patient cohorts. For example, in the CRC study, the training
dataset GSE17536 was from a US population, whereas, the test
dataset GSE14333 was from an Australian population.

AUC and accuracy are the two commonly used metrics for
evaluating the predictive ability of learning algorithms. Previously,
it has been reported that AUC and accuracy do not always coincide,
and may even contradict one another. In our study, we also noticed
clear difference between performance gain in AUC and accuracy.
For example, in the breast cancer study, LDS achieved much
higher accuracy as compared with SVM in both cross-validation
and independent validation. However, the increase in AUC was
relevantly smaller. Therefore, reporting both metrics is necessary
for a more complete picture on the performance improvement.

Although semi-supervised learning has been applied to different
biological problems including gene expression-based cancer subtype
discovery (Bair and Tibshirani, 2004; Koestler et (11., 2010; Steinfeld
et (11., 2008), based on our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report on
its application to gene expression-based classiﬁcation of human
cancer. Our results demonstrated great potential of semi-supervised

learning in this critical but difﬁcult clinical problem. The LDS
algorithm used in this study is based on the ‘cluster assumption’.
An important ﬁiture work is to compare the LDS algorithm with
other semi-supervised algorithms such as those based on the
‘manifold assumption’ (Chapelle et (11., 2006) to further investigate
the application of semi-supervised learning to gene expression-based
disease classiﬁcation.

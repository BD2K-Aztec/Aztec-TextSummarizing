ABSTRACT

Motivation: Shape-based alignment of small molecules is a widely
used approach in computer-aided drug discovery. Most shape-
based ligand structure alignment applications, both commercial and
freely available ones, use the Tanimoto coefficient or similar functions
for evaluating molecular similarity. Major drawbacks of using such
functions are the size dependence of the score and the fact that the
statistical signiﬁcance of the molecular match using such metrics is
not reported.

Results: We describe a new open-source ligand structure alignment
and virtual screening (VS) algorithm, LIGSIFT, that uses Gaussian mo-
lecular shape overlay for fast small molecule alignment and a size-
independent scoring function for efficient VS based on the statistical
significance of the score. LIGSIFI' was tested against the compounds
for 40 protein targets available in the Directory of Useful Decoys and
the performance was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve
(AUC), the Enrichment Factor (EF) and Hit Rate (HR). LIGSIFT-based
VS shows an average AUC of 0.79, average EF values of 20.8 and a
HR of 59% in the top 1% of the screened library.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identification of new lead molecules is a major challenge in the
drug discovery process, as the experimental screening of large
chemical databases is very expensive and depends on how
representative the library is. Virtual screening (VS) approaches
are frequently used for lead identiﬁcation, which can be then
veriﬁed under laboratory settings. VS approaches can be broadly
classiﬁed into protein-centric approaches (e.g. docking) and
ligand centric approaches. Protein-centric approaches do not
depend on known ligand information and are generally expected
to perform better, as they enable one to explicitly evaluate
proteiniligand interactions. However, these approaches rely
heavily on the quality of the receptor structure and suffer from
inherent limitations of the applied protocol. Ligand centric VS
methods, on the contrary, do not need receptor information and

often use known ligands as a seed to identify potential binders
based on their 2D or 3D similarity to the known active molecule
(Eckert and Baj orath, 2007). 2D VS methods generally represent
a molecule as a vector with entries indicating the presence or
absence of molecular features. These methods are popular, as
they provide a fast and easy way of ﬁshing out similar active
molecules. However, the scaffold hopping potential of such
methods is controversial (Renner and Schneider, 2006), and
both molecular size and complexity negatively affect the search
performance of such methods (Holliday et al., 2003).

In contrast, 3D VS methods are computationally taxing due to
complexities associated with ligand ﬂexibility and determination
of the optimal 3D alignment. Nevertheless, with improvement in
computational power, 3D VS methods have become popular, as
they capture the physical and functional features required for the
biological interaction and are generally capable of scaffold
hopping (Quintus et al., 2009; Rush et al., 2005). The scaffold
hopping potential of 3D methods not only help to reduce false
negatives during VS experiments, but also provide important
insights for bioisostere replacement (Jennings and Tennant,
2007), potential off-target interactions and cross-reactivity of
existing drugs.

Three-dimensional methods for aligning small molecules con-
sist of three basic components: (a) a descriptor to represent the
molecule, (b) a scoring function to assess the alignment quality
and (c) an optimization procedure to ﬁnd the best possible align-
ment with respect to the chosen scoring function. Common
choices of descriptors include molecular interaction ﬁeld-based
(Cheeseright et al., 2008), pharmacophore-based (Sperandio
et al., 2007) and shape-based representations of small molecules.
A number of algorithms for shape-based VS have emerged in the
last few years; each seeks to maximize the shape overlap between
the pair of molecules under consideration. Most use atom
centered, smooth Gaussian functions to model molecular
volume, as it helps to achieve rapid overlay and can also be
performed relatively easily using simple mathematical oper-
ations. For example, Rapid Overlay of Chemical Structures
(ROCS), a highly popular closed-source algorithm, uses a
Gaussian description of the molecular shape and chemical
nature of the ligand (Grant et al., 1996; Grant and Pickup,
1995) for ligand screening. Similarly, Align-itTM, an open-
source tool uses a Gaussian description of molecular pharmaco-
phores, but follows a different optimization approach to ﬁnd the
best overlay (Taminau et al., 2008). These and other similar tools
use the Tanimoto Coefﬁcient (TC) or similar size-dependent
functions for measuring molecular similarity (Hamza et al.,
2012; Holliday et al., 2003). Moreover, these scoring functions

lack a statistical model that can indicate the significance of struc-
tural/chemical match between molecules (Baldi and Nasr, 2010).

In this study, we present a new open-source, ligand-based VS
algorithm that provides a size-independent scoring function to
measure shape and chemical similarity and also reports the
P—Value to assess the statistical significance of the match between
a pair of molecules. Performance evaluation of LIGSIFT on the
40 targets in the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD) set shows
overall improved performance compared with other well-
established shape-based VS methods such as ROCS and
Align-itTM.

2 METHODS

2.1 Molecular representation and alignment

The 3D structure of a small molecule is represented using atom-based
descriptors in LIGSIFT (supplementary Table S1). The molecular shape-
density of every heavy atom i is described using a spherical Gaussian
function:

2/
p.(r)=w,-exp{—a,-(r — Roz} ,wherea.=n(3ri/4,,,.) 3 (1)

is the decay factor, (p,- = 2,2 is the amplitude, R,- is the atomic coordinate
for the ith atom and a,- is its van der Waals radius. The chemical nature of
pharmacophore heavy atoms (supplementary Table S1) is identiﬁed using
SMARTS expressions in OpenBabel (O’Boyle et al., 2008), and is
modeled using the same Gaussian description as the atomic shape.
Additionally, the spatial orientation of some atom-types (H-bond
donor and acceptor) is calculated based on the position of neighboring
atoms (supplementary Table S1).

Using this model, the shape/chemical density of any molecule can be
calculated as the sum of atomic densities, deﬁned as:

V=Z f aim-(r) (2)
i: l

and the overlap between two molecules A and B is calculated as the sum
of the overlaps of individual atoms’ Gaussian functions:

VA]; = Z X) f drp.(r)p,-(r)

 

iEA jEB
3/2 (3)
2: ep  ( ”)
= p-pjx —— ’
iEA 1.68 ' ori-i-orj ori-i-orj

where i and j are the heavy atom indices of molecules A and B, p,- and p,
are the atomic Gaussian distributions of each atom and  is the distance
between atom i and j.

To identify the correct shape and chemical similarity between mol-
ecules A and B, we need to ﬁrst identify the relative poses of A and B
that maximizes VAB. To achieve this, two types of quickly identiﬁable
initial alignments are used. The ﬁrst type of initial alignment is generated
by aligning the principal axes of the moment of inertia tensors of mol-
ecules A and B. This procedure helps to quickly scan the complete 3D
space with minimum iterations, but is more suitable for aligning mol-
ecules of similar size. The second type of initial alignment is based on a
three-atom superposition of an atomic triad selected from A and B.
Although a systematic search would involve all combinations of atom
pairs from both the molecules and would provide a very close to optimal
alignment, this is not a practical solution for fast VS applications.
Therefore, only pairs of atoms having similar chemical nature are used
as triad pairs to generate sub-optimal initial alignments.

Starting from each sub-optimal initial alignment, the optimal non-
sequential alignment is identiﬁed using the JonkeriVolegenant shortest
augmenting path algorithm (J onker and Volgenant, 1987), which aims to
minimize the total cost of misaligning heavy atom pairs. A cost matrix is
calculated for every heavy atom pair (1' e A, j e B), where the cost (C,-,~)
for aligning atom i and j is deﬁned as:

Cij =k — Vij, (4)

where Vi, is the overlap of the atomic Gaussian distribution between atom
i and j, and k = 100 is an arbitrary constant larger than Vi). When
evaluating chemical similarity,  is evaluated as zero for atom pairs
with dissimilar chemical types, in order to encourage matches between
atom pairs with same or similar chemical type.

Finally, a short Metropolis Monte-Carlo simulation with rigid body
rotation and translation of coordinates is performed to reﬁne and
maximize the overlap (VAB) between molecules A and B.

2.2 Molecular similarity of overlapped structures

Once the relative pose of molecules A and B that results in max-
imum overlap (VAB) is identiﬁed, the scaled TC (sTC) score is calculated
as:

TC-i-so VAB

, where TC= — (S)

TC=
S l‘l‘So VA‘l‘ VB — VAB

 

Here, TC is the Tanimoto coefﬁcient of the shape/chemical similarity, VA
and VB are the shape/chemical densities of molecules A and B calculated
using the Gaussian model (Equation 2). so in Equation(5) is the scaling
factor that ensures that the mean molecular similarity scores are size-
independent and is calculated as:

(a-i-bln (VA)-l-cln (VB)-i-dln (VA -i- VB)) — 6
S0:
6 —l

 

(6)

To estimate so, we need a random background distribution of molecu-
lar similarity (MS) scores consistent with the conformational variability
of small molecules. Therefore, a conformational pool of 737 PubChem
molecules of various sizes was generated using RDKit’s distance-geom-
etry conformer generator. For each molecule, a maximum of 50 low-
energy conformers were generated, and each conformer was structurally
aligned with 11604 representative PDB ligands. In addition, all PDB
ligands were also aligned to each other. Pairwise TC values for shape
similarity and chemical similarity obtained after aligning molecule pairs
of various sizes were used for calculating so (using Equation 6). This
scaling of TC values ensures that the molecular similarity scores are
size-independent for random match between ligands. The parameters
for a, b, c, d and e in Equation 6 for different optimization schemes
(shape similarity, chemical similarity and combination of shape and
chemical similarity) are listed in supplementary Table S2.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of scaled TC mean and unscaled TC
mean obtained for random structural alignments. Both scaled shape and
chemical similarity scores have a narrow distribution with a maximum
density near 0.49 and 0.42, respectively, reﬂecting that the mean scores
for alignment between random pair of molecules are size independent.
Meanwhile, molecular similarities measured using unscaled TC have a
large spread, which reﬂects their size dependence.

2.3 Statistical signiﬁcance of molecular similarity

The statistical signiﬁcance of the sTC between any two molecules is
estimated by comparing the similarity score with values obtained for
the alignment between random molecule pairs. The structure similarity
of random pairs of various sizes was calculated using the same procedure
as described above for calculating so and modeled by Gumbel distribution
ﬁtting in the R evir package. A statistical model of ﬁtted distributions was

2.4 Validation dataset

For the validation, we have used a standard database of active and decoy
molecules for 40 pharmaceutically relevant protein targets, listed in the
DUD (Huang et al., 2006). For each active molecule, there are approxi-
mately 36 physically similar but topologically dissimilar decoys, selected
based on matching molecular weight, number of hydrogen-bond donor
and acceptors, number of rotatable bonds and logP. Duplicate entries
were removed; thus only a single entry for each molecule in the database
is retained. The list of all the 40 targets along with the number of actives
and decoys is found in supplementary Table S4.

To evaluate the effect of conformational ﬂexibility on VS, conform-
ational models of the ligand derived from the 40 DUD proteiniligand
complexes and database molecules were generated using OMEGA
(Hawkins et al., 2010) with default settings.

2.5 Evaluation of VS

To evaluate the performance of different screening approaches, we used
the standard evaluation metrics: (a) the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve and (b) the enrichment factor (EF) of screened compound
library and (c) the hit rate (HR). The ROC curve plots the true positive
rate as a function of false positive rate. The area under the curve (AUC) is
frequently used to quantify the shape of the ROC curve, with values in
the range [(Fl], with 0.5 indicating random performance.

For evaluating the performance in the top x% of the screened library,
a common metric EF has been applied, which is deﬁned as:

- - x% x"/
True Posnlves /Nsclg0th (9)
N actives / N total

We have used EF1%, EF5% and EF10% to analyze the performance.

EF"% =

A known problem of EF is its dependency on the ratio of active and
decoy molecules in the database. Therefore, we have used an additional
metric HR, deﬁned as:

0 EF"%
HR” = —a°‘“a1 x 100 (10)

x%
ideal

where EF?‘% is the ideal EF that would be obtained in x% of the

ideal
database.

3 RESULTS

VS was performed for all the 40 DUD targets using bioactive
and both single and multiple database conformers and database
molecules were ranked using various shape and chemical simi-
larity metrics. Multi-conformer models of database molecules
were generated using OMEGA (OpenEye Inc.).

3.1 Effect of size-independent scoring function on VS

A common problem in VS is the large number of false negative
predictions. One possible cause is the size dependence of the
scoring functions that are used in scoring and ranking. We
sought to address this problem by scaling a widely used metric
TC, so that it becomes size independent (scaled TC). To examine
the effect of scaling, independent of the contribution from dif-
ferent conformers of the database molecules, we used a single
conformer per database molecule, as provided in the downloaded
DUD structure ﬁle, which was generated using CORINA
(Huang et al., 2006). Table 1 shows the average AUC and EF
values obtained for the 40 DUD targets, using the bioactive
query conformer and a single conformer of the database mol-
ecules (see Section 2.4). The same molecular overlay was used for
both TC and sTC.

Overall, sTC shows a small improvement in both average
AUC and EFs on the DUD set. In most cases, AUC and EF
values either remain unchanged or the improvement was mar-
ginal, because the size of seed ligand and database molecules are
mostly similar in the DUD set (supplementary Table S5). Only
for the targets where database molecules were of much different
size than the seed ligand does the advantage of scaling TC
become apparent on average (supplementary Table S5). To
examine this, we increased the size and heterogeneity of database
molecules by including active and decoy molecules from other 39
proteins in the DUD set. We observe (supplementary Table S6)
that as the size of database molecules diverge from the seed
ligand, the difference between AUC and EF1% of sTC and un-
scaled TC becomes larger. This suggests that sTC helped to rank
active molecules, which had statistically more signiﬁcant matches
but lower TC scores higher than those that had statistically
less significant but higher TC scores. For example, Figure 2
shows structural superposition of a cdk2 active molecule
ZINC03814437, on the seed ligand taken from cdk2 receptor
structure (PDB: lckp). As the size of the active database mol-
ecule (in tan) is smaller than the seed ligand (in cyan), the large
volume of the seed ligand overwhelms the unscaled chemical TC
score of TC = 0.415. Based on TC, ZINC03814437 is ranked at
position 123 (6.7% of database). For sTC, the chemical similar-
ity is scaled, so the same overlap has a sTC = 0.54, which ranks
the active molecule at position 62 (3.3% of database); highlight-
ing the advantage of a size-independent scoring function.

3.2 VS performance of LIGSIFT

The performance of LIGSIFT is next benchmarked using the
bioactive conformation of the seed ligand and modeled multiple
conformations of database molecules. Table 2 shows the AUC
values of the ROC curves (supplementary Fig. S3) for each of the
40 DUD targets.

Overall, LISIFT shows very good VS performance. The
average AUC for the 40 targets is 0.79:l:0.20, which is better
than the well-established shape-based VS tools like ROCS
(AUC = 0.73 :l: 0.2), that uses a similar combo scoring function,
and is much better than available open source tools like
Align-ItTM (AUC = 0.75:l:0.23). For 38 targets, LIGSIFT vs
rankings were better than random (AUC > 0.5), while it failed for
two targets: PDGFRB and SRC. The control methods, Align-It
and ROCS, also failed on these two target proteins (AUC<0.5),
in addition to another three and four other proteins (Table 2),
respectively. A detailed analysis of these two failed target
proteins suggests that the seed ligand may not be a good repre-
sentative for fishing out other active molecules for this receptor.
For instance, when we used other active molecules in the
database as our seed molecule, AUC values as well as EF and
HR generally improved for both the proteins (supplementary
Table S7). As expected, the performance using these database
seed molecules depends on how well they represent other actives
molecules in the database. These cases highlight the applicability
and advantage of using multiple seed ligands to identify similar
active molecules from the database.

Nevertheless, as observed in case of single conformers, even
when we use multiple database conformations, the size-independ-
ent scaled TC (sTC) scoring performs slightly better than simply

AMPC, AR, COMT, COX2, DHFR, GPB, HMGA, HSP90,
INHA, MR, NA, PNP and RXR; while no enrichment
(EF1% = 0) was observed for SRC (supplementary Table S8).

These values are comparable to those reported for
ROCS (EF1% = 19.4:I:12.9) (Kirchmair et al., 2009), and
much better than what is obtained using Align-It
(EF1% = 16.9:l: 12.5). However, the enrichment of active mol-
ecules using ROCS VS is null (EF1% = 0) for four proteins
(FGFRl, GART, TRYPSIN and VEGFR2), while Align-It
failed on three proteins (COMT, PR and VEGFR2).

Although the AUC of ROC curves along with EF1% are
commonly used for evaluating VS performance, a known disad-
vantage of EF is its dependence on the ratio of actives and
decoys in the database, which makes comparison of various
methods on different datasets ambiguous. Therefore, we add-
itionally used the Hit Rate (Equation 10) for evaluating VS per-
formance. The average hit rate of LIGSIFT in the top 1% of the
screened library was 59%, better than the ROCS hit rate of 54.6
and the Align-It hit rate of 48.0%. These results clearly show
that on average LIGSIFT ranks a large number of active mol-
ecules as best among the screened molecules in the database. For
example, 22 of the 40 DUD proteins achieved a hit rate >50%,
while only two proteins had a hit rate of <10% (supplementary
Table S9).

It is interesting to note that even though multiple ligand
conformations should result in better molecular overlap and is
expected to have better VS performance, the observed improve-
ment in average AUC was marginal (increasing from 0.78 to
0.79). The average EF1% showed the largest improvement,
increased from 17.9 to 20.8. To examine the effect of molecular
ﬂexibility on VS performance, we further analyzed EF1% for
molecules with different molecular ﬂexibility (supplementary
Table S10), measured by their number of rotatable bonds, but
found no correlation between molecular ﬂexibility and VS
performance.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Shape-based ligand structural alignment has multiple applica-
tions, the most practical being drug discovery. Even though

#HR values calculated using EF data reported in (Kirchmair et al., 2009).
av: average; sd: standard deviation; comb: combined shape and chemical similarity
scores (1:1)

there is a rapid increase in the number of tools developed for
this purpose, the metrics used for evaluating molecular similarity
in these applications are size dependent and lack statistical sig-
niﬁcance quantiﬁcation.

Here, we have developed a new algorithm (LIGSIFT) for the
structural overlay of small molecules and quantiﬁcation of
molecular similarity (both shape and chemical) using a size-
independent scoring function (sTC). This score is essentially a
scaled TC based on a random background distribution of shape
and chemical TC calculated for millions of overlays of molecules
of various sizes. A rigorous benchmark and evaluation done
using three standard metrics, namely AUC of ROC curve, EF
and Hit Rate (HR), highlight the improvements in VS using
scaled TC (sTC) over commonly used size-dependent ranking
functions like TC, especially for database molecules that have
different size than seed ligand.

In a commonly used DUD benchmark dataset, LIGSIFT
performs better (AUC = 0.79:l:0.2) than other well-established
shape-based VS methods like ROCS (reported
AUC = 0.73:l:0.2) (Kirchmair et al., 2009), ShaEP (reported
AUC = 0.64:I:0.17) (Vainio et al., 2009), MolShaCS (reported
AUC = 0.63 :I:0.08) and Align-It (0.75:l:0.2). Overall, for 95%
of the test proteins, the VS performance of LIGSIFT was non-
random and the hit rate of active molecules was >10% in the top
1% of screened library.

While these results are encouraging, we noticed that using a
given seed ligand, LIGSIFT was able to retrieve only half of the
active molecules in nearly 55% of the tested proteins. This
phenomenon is not restricted to only LIGSIFT, but was also
observed for other shape-based VS tools, suggesting that a
single-seed ligand contains a limited imprint of the physicochem—
ical information of the ligand-binding site and may not be sufﬁ-
cient for identifying all active molecules present in the ligand
database. In addition, it is also possible that these missed
active molecules bind at a different location on the protein.
For these cases, it might be useful to use a diverse set of
known active ligands as seeds. If other active molecules are
unknown, ligands from homologous proteins can be useful as
seeds in VS experiments. In future work, we will explore this
option in further detail.

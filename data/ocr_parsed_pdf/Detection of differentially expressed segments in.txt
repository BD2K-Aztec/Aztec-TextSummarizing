ABSTRACT

Motivation: Tiling arrays have been a mainstay of unbiased
genome-wide transcriptomics over the last decade. Currently
available approaches to identify expressed or differentially expressed
segments in tiling array data are limited in the recovery of the
underlying gene structures and require several parameters that are
intensity-related or partly dataset-specific.

Results: We have developed TileShuff 1e, a statistical approach
that identifies transcribed and differentially expressed segments
as significant differences from the background distribution
while considering sequence-specific affinity biases and cross-
hybridization. lt avoids dataset-specific parameters in order to
provide better comparability of different tiling array datasets, based
on different technologies or array designs. TileShuffle detects
highly and differentially expressed segments in biological data with
significantly lower false discovery rates under equal sensitivities than
commonly used methods. Also, it is clearly superior in the recovery
of exon—intron structures. It further provides window z-scores as a
normalized and robust measure for visual inspection.

1 INTRODUCTION

During the last decade, tiling arrays have been a mainstay of
unbiased transcriptomics (e.g., Bertone et (11., 2004; Kapranov
et (11., 2002; Rinn et (11., 2003) and continue to contribute to
novel ﬁndings. Tiling arrays have recently been applied, e.g., in
the discovery of novel long non-coding RNAs (Guttman et (11.,
2009), to the identiﬁcation of spatio-temporal patterns of gene
expression (Spencer et (11., 2011), to the characterization of the
transcriptome in 30 distinct developmental stages as well as in 25 cell
lines of Drosophila melanogaster (Cherbas et (11., 2011; Graveley
et (11., 2011), and t0 the identiﬁcation of a ‘large complement of
novel loci’ with stage-speciﬁc expression in Caenorhabditis elegans
(Wang et (11., 2011). High-throughput sequencing methods have

recently shown distinct advantages over array-based approaches
(Agarwal et (11., 2010; Bradford et (11., 2010). However, due to
the availability of large tiling array reference datasets, e.g., from
ENCODE and a clear statistical understanding on how to model
differential expression in microarray data, tiling arrays are an
important experimental approach in transcriptomics, and tiling array
data analysis is a relevant topic in computational biology.

One of the most widely used methods in tiling array expression
analysis was introduced by (Kampa et (11., 2004) and is implemented
in the Tiling Array Software (TAS). In brief, the local expression
levels of probes are estimated by calculating the pseudo-
median 0r Hodge—Lehmann estimator over intensities of probes
within genomic distance of bandwidth. Transcribed segments are
collections of expressed probes, i.e., probes with a smoothed
intensity above a given threshold, with maximal genomic distance of
maxgap and minimal length of minrun. TAS extends the method of
Kampa et (11. by estimating the signiﬁcance of differential expression
using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. It tests for signiﬁcant changes of
probe intensities among states applied to local windows of given
width centered around each probe. Hence, p-values for differential
expression are assigned to each probe.

More recently, Johnson et (11. introduced an approach that models
the expected probe behavior. It is available in the tool MAT (Johnson
et (11., 2006). Originally, it was designed to detect regions enriched
by ChIP-chip but has also been applied to detect transcriptional
activity (Kadener et (11., 2009; Lee et (11., 2009). In contrast to
TAS, MAT uses a mixture model to normalize probe intensities
by estimating the expected binding afﬁnity 0n the basis of the
composition and copy number of their nucleotide sequence on the
corresponding genome. To identify (differentially) expressed probes,
the score over all normalized intensities of probes within a local
window, given by a bandwidth parameter, is compared with a null
distribution. This distribution is composed of all non-overlapping
window scores that can be calculated on the same array or the
array in a different state during expression or differential expression
analysis, respectively. Hence, it uses a two-step approach with
different background distributions to normalize the probe intensity
and assess its signiﬁcance within a probe-centered window. In the
detection of (differentially) expressed segments, positive probes
are joined if their genomic distance is below a given maxgap
parameter and segments enclosing more than minprobe probes are
then reported. TileProbe is a variant of MAT, which models
residual probe effects that cannot be explained by the MAT model
by incorporating publicly available datasets (Judy and Ji, 2009).

Ti le Probe has been successfully applied to detect enriched motifs
in ChIP-chip tiling array data, but in contrast to MAT, no application
to detect differential expression has been reported. HAT uses a
hypergeometric distribution to assess the probability to observe a
speciﬁc number of probes within a window. It is less sensitive
but more speciﬁc than MAT and cannot directly be used to detect
differential expression (Taskesen et a1., 2010). Lastly, HMMTiling
models probe-speciﬁc effects by a normal distribution deﬁned for
each probe individually compared with a control group (Li et a1.,
2005), but requires many samples in order to estimate the variance
for a probe correctly which may not be available for arbitrary types
of tiling arrays.

gSAM, is a powerful framework for analyzing differential
response of time series tiling array data (Ghosh et a1., 2007). It
generalizes SAM (Tusher et a1., 2001) from a gene-centric view
to genomic intervals in an underlying piece-wise model. Under
this model, the time series is subdivided into logical segments
and differential changes are analyzed on each of these segments
separately. gSAM requires replicates which are often not available
for whole genome tiling data. Another method suitable to detect
differential expression on tiling array data is TileMap which
assesses the signiﬁcance of each probe by averaging over moderated
t-statistics within a pre-deﬁned window size (Ji and Wong, 2005).
(Kechris et a1., 2010) propose the averaging of p-values instead of
test statistics providing a more ﬂexible framework to evaluate more
complicated experimental designs and to overcome the problem that
the length of a sliding window may not be large enough to assume
normal distribution. However, both methods again require replicates
because probe-wise expression changes are assessed by hypothesis
tests. An HMM-based approach was introduced by Munch et a1.
(2006) that adaptively models tiling array data on given annotation
and subsequently predicts expression on the genomic sequence. It
does not require ad hoc parameters but is limited to expression
analysis and hence cannot predict differential expression.

Huber and colleagues presented a powerful segmentation
approach for tiling array data, which controls for probe-speciﬁc
effects by normalizing probe-wise intensities to a reference
experiment with genomic DNA (Huber et a1., 2006). Recently,
Karpikov et a1. (2011) introduced a wavelet transformation to tiling
array ChIP-chip data in order to discriminate regions of activity from
noisy data.

Our aim is to use tiling array data for identifying novel ncRNAs,
which are differentially expressed in response to critical signaling
pathways or cellular processes. For this purpose, a data analysis
method is required to (i) analyze differential expression in tiling
array data for genome-wide approaches; (ii) allow the latter
without using replicate tiling array experiments due to limitations
in the availability of sample material; (iii) identify boundaries
of differentially expressed segments sufﬁciently precise to allow
transcript annotation; and (iv) avoid the use of dataset-speciﬁc
parameters which may hamper analyzing differential expression
between arrays of different experiments. In our opinion, none of the
state-of-the-art methods sufﬁciently fulﬁlls all these requirements.

Here, we present TileShuffle, a novel tiling array analysis
approach that identiﬁes transcribed and differentially expressed
segments in terms of signiﬁcant differences from the background
distribution by using a permutation test statistic. Signiﬁcance is
assessed on minimal expected transcriptional units rather than
on a single-probe level. TileShuf f le does not require any

dataset-speciﬁc parameters, e.g., intensity-related thresholds or
parameters concerning collection of expressed probes. This is
particularly favorable since in common tiling array experiments
neither spike-ins to control the false discovery rate [FDR; as in
(Kampa et a1., 2004)] nor sufﬁciently large positive and negative
sets to optimally adjust these ad hoc parameters might be available.

We compare TileShuffle to TAS and MAT in analyzing
differential expression in one human whole genome tiling array
dataset and one spike-in dataset (Sasaki et a1., 2007). TAS is the most
widely used tool in tiling array expression analysis and although
MAT was originally designed for ChIP-chip data, it was successfully
applied to detect transcriptional activity. All, TileShuf fle, TAS,
and MAT, do not require replicates to detect differentially expressed
transcripts which is in particular favorable for studies with limited
material and costs. At the same FDR, TileShuffle achieves
signiﬁcantly higher sensitivities than the other methods. Also, it
detects boundaries of differentially expressed exons with higher
precision than TAS and MAT.

2 METHODS

2.1 Expression detection

To determine transcribed segments in tiling array data, we apply
a statistical approach that differentiates expression signals from
the background distribution under consideration of common tiling
array biases. Given the array design of nearly uniformly distributed
probe sequences over the non-repetitive genome, hybridization
afﬁnity and hence signal intensity is highly dependent on the
probe sequence itself, i.e., nucleotide composition and nucleotide
positioning (Johnson et a1., 2006; Royce et a1., 2007). Analogously,
in absence of speciﬁc transcripts, a detected probe signal may solely
originate from non-speciﬁc hybridization, e.g., background noise
and cross-hybridization, causing single spikes in the tiling array data.
Here, cross-hybridization refers to the hybridization of DNA/RNA
fragments to probe sequences that are similar or even equal to their
actual target, but originate from different genomic loci.

Handling common tiling array biases: Even though transcripts are
expected to be detected by several neighboring probes in similar
scale, non-speciﬁc hybridization and sequence-speciﬁc effects like
nucleotide composition and positioning can largely increase the
detected signal intensity of single probes while having no effect
on the neighboring probes and hence roughen the signal across
the tiling array. For example, probes with high GC content tend to
exhibit increased signal intensities compared to probes with low GC
content. In addition to the GC content, Royce et a1. highlighted the
inﬂuence of position-speciﬁc effects of each nucleotide on the probe
intensities, e.g., higher average intensities of probes with Gs toward
the probe start or Cs toward the probe end (Royce et a1., 2007).
These sequence-speciﬁc biases introduce a disparity in the binding
afﬁnity among different probe sequences, subsequently denoted as
sequence-speciﬁc afﬁnity.

We therefore assess the signiﬁcance of expression on windows of
length 1 with respect to the background distribution rather than on
single probes. A score Se(w) is assigned to each sliding window
w by applying a scoring ﬁinction (arithmetic mean trimmed by
maximal and minimal value or median) over the signal intensities
of all probes within the window. Due to the robustness of the
two scoring functions, window scores are less susceptible to

signal intensity variation within a given window originating solely
from outliers. In addition, probes are subdivided into afﬁnity
bins with similar expected sequence-speciﬁc afﬁnity and bins are
processed independently from each other. Accordingly, intensities of
probes that belong to different afﬁnity bins must not be interchanged.
Otherwise, the expression analysis might favor windows simply due
to the sequence compositions of their probes, e.g., high GC content.

Assessing signiﬁcance of expression: In order to estimate the
signiﬁcance of a window score Se(w), we repeatedly permute all
probe intensities across the array while interchanging only those
that belong to the same sequence-speciﬁc afﬁnity bin, recompute
the window scores, and compare them with the original ones. We
use random permutations of probe intensities to remain independent
of any annotation or underlying gene structure.

By counting the number of permuted windows with higher
score, we estimate empirical p-values of windows. Following a
Benjamini—Hochberg multiple testing correction (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995), all windows of high signiﬁcance, i.e., the ones
with corrected p-values (q-values) below a given threshold, are
deemed ‘expressed’. Since permutations necessitate sufﬁciently
large groups, the binning is only based on the GC content of
each probe sequence as the most dominant bias on hybridization
afﬁnity (Fig. 1a). In accordance with the ﬁndings of Johnson et a1.
(2006), the copy number of probes, i.e., number of perfect matches
of the probe sequence to the genomic sequence and hence the
extent of potential signal overlay, showed only a minor impact
on signal intensity (Supplementary Fig. Sla). We therefore refrain
from controlling for copy number in favor of larger bins during
permutation. The described algorithm to detect expressed segments
in tiling array data is illustrated in Supplementary Figure S4.

2.2 Differential expression detection

In many cases, tiling array data is available from different cellular
states or other biological conditions and one might be interested in
structural changes in the expression between different conditions.
To avoid that signal intensity variation at the detection limit is

classiﬁed as differential expression, we require that differentially
expressed intervals must also be signiﬁcantly expressed relative
to the background distribution in at least one of the investigated
conditions, and call these intervals highdiﬁ’. This is analogous to the
frequently performed unspeciﬁc ﬁltering in conventional microarray
data analysis.

Assessing signiﬁcance of diﬁ’erential expression: On the contrary
to one-state expression analyses, signal intensities are normalized
using a quantile-normalization across each tiling array in both
considered conditions (Bolstad et a1., 2003). Expression shifts are
then measured in terms of log-fold changes (i.e., differences of
log signals) between probe intensities in both cellular conditions.
In consequence, sequence-speciﬁc effects cancel out and afﬁnity
classiﬁcation as it is done for expression detection is rendered
unnecessary (Supplementary Fig. Slb). Fold changes assume
constant variance among probes, which might not be valid in any
case. However, if replicate data is not available, fold changes are the
only applicable measure for differential signal changes. Otherwise,
it is possible to use moderated t-statistics in TileShuffle, an
empirical Bayes method to shrink the probe-wise variance toward
a common value. Hence, it is preferable over ordinary t-statistics
(Witten and Tibshirani, 2007).

Due to the two-tailed distribution of fold changes, the estimation
of p-values needs to be adapted. We implemented and compared
two different variants to detect signiﬁcant changes. In variant
A, window scores Sd(w) of differential expression are calculated
following the same outline as described for the expression analysis
with the exception that two-tailed p-values are estimated in order
to regard both regulation directions, up and down. The multiple
testing correction is then adjusted to account for these additional
comparisons. In variant B, it is assumed that entire windows
represent the smallest unit of expression and are either constant,
or up- or downregulated between two conditions. Converse
behavior of neighboring probes is considered a consequence
of non-speciﬁc hybridization. In order to correct for this bias,
the presumed direction of regulation is initially assigned to

 

1473

112 /3.Io's[BumoprOJxosotwuiJOJutotq”:duq moi; papeolumoq

C. Otto et al.

 

each window w on the basis of the sign of its expression
score Se(w). Subsequently, all converse probes, i.e., probes with
negative log-fold change within positive windows or vice versa,
are ignored and neither permuted nor incorporated into the
score calculation for differential expression. Consequently, positive
and negative windows are compared with different background
distributions. To assess the signiﬁcance of a window score Sd(w) of
differential expression, a one-tailed empirical p-value is estimated
(according to the corresponding background distribution) and
corrected for multiple testing, similar to the one-state analysis.
The assignment of the signiﬁcance to a window in case of the
differential expression analysis with both variants is illustrated in
Supplementary Figures S5 and S6. Overall, both variants merely
differ in the window score calculation (independently from the
used scoring function) and multiple testing correction in differential
expression analysis. Due to their difference in treating converse
probe behavior possibly leading to more robustness of variant B,
we implemented and included both of them in our comparative
analyses.

2.3 Estimating z-scores

In addition to the statistical signiﬁcance, a normalized score can be
reported for each processed window on the tiling array. Since the
score distribution of the permuted windows is a sample from the
background distribution, a z-score of a window w is calculated by

z(w>=x_”. (1)
U

 

where x is either the score Se(w) or Sd(w), while [1 and a are the
mean and stande deviation (SD) of the permuted window scores,
respectively. To obtain a probe-wise measure, the probe median z-
score z(p) is deﬁned as the median over the z-scores of all windows
enclosing the probe 1). In consequence, probe median z-scores may
be used as a normalized measure of probe expression in order to
visually inspect regions of interest.

2.4 Validation

A custom microarray based on a different manufacturer, labeling
procedure, and probe length has been designed to validate the tiling
array results as an alternative experimental approach. We used the
Agilent eArray procedure (https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/)
to ensure that probe-speciﬁc biases are minimized and designed
probes of 60 mer length for both reading directions of all highdiﬁ’
regions that have been identiﬁed by Ti leShuffle and TAS. We,
ﬁlrthermore, veriﬁed that the custom microarray also covers an
unbiased sample of the regions identiﬁed by MAT (Supplementary
Table S6). In addition, the custom microarray also includes probes
for genomic regions, determined independently of the tiling array
experiment: probes for all human mRNAs, for genomic regions
predicted to contain a conserved secondary structure identiﬁed by
RNAz (Washietl et a1., 2005) or Evofold (Pedersen et a1., 2006),
and known ncRNAs from public databases.

The custom microarray was run in triplicates and differentially
expressed probes were identiﬁed using the statistical software
package R and Bioconductor (Gentleman et a1., 2004). Expression
intensities were quantile normalized (Bolstad et a1., 2003) and a
linear model was ﬁtted using the Lima R package (Smyth, 2005).
Reliable variance estimations were obtained by empirical Bayes

moderated t-statistics and the FDR was controlled by Benjamini—
Hochberg adjustment (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). A probe
on the custom microarray is called signiﬁcant in case the adjusted
p-value is found to be < 0.05.

In addition to the custom microarray, we tested the performance
of TileShuffle, TAS and MAT on the outcome of a spike-
in dataset comprising 162 full-length cDNA clones at two
concentrations, 0.0055 ug and 0.055 ug, in the gene-dense regions
of chromosome 22 (Sasaki et a1., 2007).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Control of tiling array speciﬁc biases

We evaluate the capability of Ti leShuf f le to cope with the most
dominant sequence-speciﬁc afﬁnity effects in tiling array data such
as GC content and nucleotide positioning of a probe. Assuming that
most probes show only non-speciﬁc hybridization, the correlation
between GC content of probe sequences and their detected signal
intensities (R2=0.383, Fig. 1a) indicates a measurable bias that
needs to be taken into account. Otherwise, intensity-based analyses
may favor windows simply due to their GC-richness. A signal
smoothing as realized by windowing and calculating the probe
median z-score z(p), does not correct for the bias sufﬁciently
(R2 =0.266, Supplementary Fig. S2a).

In theory, the use of afﬁnity-based binning with respect to the GC
content of probe sequences should reduce the general effect whereas
the intensity of outliers and hence potentially expressed probes
remains relatively stable. Supplementary Figure S2b illustrates a
strong reduction of the sequence-speciﬁc afﬁnity bias with merely
two GC content bins (R2 =0.037). Higher numbers of bins further
attenuate the correlation between GC content of probe sequences
and their probe median z-score, e.g., R2=0.019 with three bins
(Fig. 1b). In each case, the distribution of the outliers (black dots)
differs from the original data only to a minor extent. According to
these ﬁndings, three bins may already sufﬁce to efﬁciently attenuate
this bias while retaining sufﬁciently large permutation bins.

To illustrate the inﬂuence of position-speciﬁc effects of each
nucleotide on the probe intensities, we use the R package
Starr (Zacher et a1., 2010) on probe intensities (Fig. 2a) and on
probe median z-scores z(p) after applying TileShuffle with
three GC content bins (Fig. 2b). Using Starr, we can assess the
position-speciﬁc bias of every nucleotide in each of the 25 positions
within the probe sequence for given probe scores (e.g., probe
intensities or probe median z-scores). More precisely, for any
position and nucleotide, it calculates the difference between the
mean score of probes, where the nucleotide is at this particular
position within the probe sequence, and the overall mean probe
score. To obtain comparable scales, the changes of probe intensities
and probe median z-scores are normalized by dividing them
by the SD of their distributions. Overall, even though position-
speciﬁc biases are not explicitly considered in our framework,
the combination of afﬁnity-based permutations and overlapping
windows is capable of greatly reducing position-speciﬁc biases in
the tiling array data (Fig. 2b). Correction of this bias is not only
a consequence of windowing, but also depends on afﬁnity-based
permutations: performing the analysis on probe median z-scores
after applying Ti leShuf f le with only one GC bin and hence

tiling array data and are both applicable to non-replicated data
which is frequently the case for expensive whole genome tiling
experiments. The three algorithms are evaluated in two different
scenarios. In the ﬁrst, we apply the different algorithms to a tiling
array dataset of human foreskin ﬁbroblasts which are synchronized
by serum starvation in G0 or in G1 phase of the cell cycle.

Human Tiling 1.0 array set‘. It consists of 14 arrays where probes
are tiled at approx. 35 base pair (bp) intervals across the whole
human genome with gaps of approx. 10 bp. The tiling array data
is compared with a custom array experiment with considerably
lower FDR as a reference. This allows to assess the performance
of the algorithms applied to real biological data and to perform
statistics on a large number of differentially expressed elements.
In the second scenario, we apply all three algorithms to a spike-
in dataset of 162 full-length cDNA clones, which are hybridized
at two, 10-fold different concentrations to an Affymetrix chr21/22
array (Sasaki et a1., 2007). In this scenario, positives and negatives
are more clearly deﬁned than above, but the number of differentially
expressed intervals is comparably low and the extent of differential
expression and complexity of the sample is more artiﬁcial.

For MAT and TAS, the expression and differential expression
analysis is carried out independently from each other: Highdiﬁ’
regions are obtained by intersecting intervals identiﬁed as
differentially expressed with those intervals deemed as ‘expressed’
in at least one of the compared biological states. Ti leShuf fle,
in contrast, takes regions found to be signiﬁcantly expressed in at
least one of the compared states (one-state analysis) as input for
the two-state analysis, assesses differential expression solely on the
expressed segments and directly reports highdiﬁ’ regions.

For one-state analyses, i.e., determination of expressed regions,
parameters for TAS have been set following Kampa et a1. (2004).
Parameters for MAT as given in Johnson et a1. (2006) are geared
toward ChIP-chip analysis and not suitable for expression analysis.
Upon inspection of positive control transcripts, we identiﬁed
optimal parameters for MAT as the same or analogous values as
used for TAS. In summary, we set bandwidth: 35, i.e., on average
the probe intensities are smoothed by calculating the Hodges—
Lehman estimator over three probes, and the maximal gap between
positive probes to be included in a positive interval maxgap=40.
The minimal length or minimal probe count of segments to be
reported were set to minrun=90 and minprobe=3, for TAS and
MAT, respectively. Perfect match (PM) and mismatch (MM) probe
intensities were utilized in TAS using an intensity threshold of 150.

For expression analyses with MAT, which uses only PM
intensities, a p-value threshold is set to 0.05 which yielded the best
results in terms of sensitivity and FDR in the analysis of the cell
cycle tiling array dataset. P-value cutoffs were tested in the range of
10—10 to 0.05. Ti leShuffle was applied using only PM probes,
the arithmetic mean trimmed by maximal and minimal value as
scoring function, 10000 permutations, and a q-value threshold of
0.05. TileShuffle was applied using window sizes 20, 200,
and 400 and different numbers of GC bins ranging from 1 to 9, to
assess the effect of these two parameters. The intermediate window
size of 200 was chosen in order to include an adequate number of
probes in the calculation of the window scores Se and Sd, and to
ensure that the majority of known exons is spanned by one single
window. The median exon length of known protein-coding genes is
118 bp, while 90% of the exons are shorter than 228 bp according
to GENCODE version 3c (Harrow et a1., 2006).

Analysis of differential expression was performed with the same
parameters, except bandwidth: 150 for TAS and MAT and 100 000
permutations for TileShuf f 1e, both aiming at accommodating

the more rugged nature of the expression difference signal (log-fold
change).

For the whole genome scenario, highdiﬁ intervals were generated
with all three tools over a range of q- and p-value cutoffs,
respectively. The custom microarray was run in triplicates for each
of the biological conditions of the tiling array experiment and was
used as a reference to estimate sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and FDR,
deﬁned as follows:

 

.t. .t TP (2)
Sens] IV] = —
y P

FP

SpeCI Cly N ( )

FP+TP

The number of true positives (TP) corresponds to the number
of nucleotides which are highdiﬁ’ in the tiling array analysis and
overlap with a probe that was found signiﬁcantly differentially
expressed in the corresponding custom microarray experiment.
The number of false positives (FP) is deﬁned as the number of
those nucleotides in highdiﬁ intervals that overlap a probe that is
not signiﬁcantly differentially expressed in the custom microarray
experiment. The number of positive nucleotides (P) is deﬁned as the
sum of all nucleotides of probes that are signiﬁcantly differentially
expressed in the custom microarray experiment (FDR<0.05),
whereas the number of negative nucleotides (N) corresponds to
the sum of all nucleotides of probes that are not signiﬁcantly
differentially expressed in the custom microarray experiment
(FDR30.05).

The results for each algorithm are illustrated as receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve and as a function of sensitivity
versus FDR (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. S7a). Overall,
TileShuf fle in both tested variants A and B clearly outperforms
the two other algorithms. For example, at a maximal FDR of
20%, both variants of TileShuffle yield a sensitivity of
approx. 23%, which is approx. 4- and 11-fold increase compared
with TAS and MAT, respectively. Both TileShuffle variants
differ only to a minor extent from each other but variant B is
generally more restrictive and hence recommended as the default
choice. Evaluating the three algorithms based on counts of intervals
rather than on nucleotides yields concordant results with the latter
(Supplementary Fig. SS).

In this test scenario, we also investigated the inﬂuence of the
number of GC bins and different window sizes on the ROC curve.
The worst performance is observed for one GC bin. This shows
that probes with low GC content tend to exhibit lower signal
intensities than probes with high GC content and hence are less
likely to be found in the right tail of the signal intensity distribution
(Supplementary Fig. S16). A number of three GC bins results in
higher sensitivity at similar FDR, while increasing the number of
GC bins ﬁlrther yields only minor improvements at high FDR
values. Following Occam’s razor, we hence select the simpler
model, and recommend to use three GC bins as the default for the
one-state analysis. A window size of 400 bp leads to the best ROC
curve, but exhibits to fail in exon boundary detection described
in Section 3.3 (Supplementary Figs S17—S20). A window size of
20 bp delivers only very few highdiﬁ’ regions, resulting in very
low sensitivities. Thus, a window size of 200 bp seems to be the

Tiling array data analysis

 

optimal trade-off between good sensitivity and good recovery of
exon—intron structures at low FDR values.

In similar manner, we estimated the sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and
FDR in case of the spike-in dataset. Therein, the positive set
comprises all genomic regions covered by the 162 full-length cDNA
clones, i.e., 877 exonic regions, which were spiked in at two
different concentrations. The set of negative regions comprises all
unique protein coding exons annotated in GENCODE version 3c
that do not overlap with any positive region. The GENCODE
annotation was converted from human genome version hg18 to
th7 using the UCSC liftover tool. The number of TP corresponds
to the number of nucleotides in positive regions which are highdiﬁ’
in the tiling array analysis. The number of FP is deﬁned as the
number of nucleotides in negative regions which are in highdiﬁ’
in the tiling array analysis. Accordingly, the number of positive
nucleotides (P) is deﬁned as the sum of all nucleotides in positive
regions, while the number of negative nucleotides (N) corresponds
to the sum of all nucleotides in negative regions. The resulting ROC
curves are depicted in Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure S7b.
In summary, all three methods recover the differentially expressed
exons as all reach high sensitivity values at high speciﬁcity or low
FDR values. However, Ti leShuf fle reaches maximal sensitivity
at comparable FDR values. Even though a spike-in experiment
allows to precisely deﬁne TP and FP rates, it is artiﬁcial and different
from real expression perturbation studies as much less noise is
observed (Supplementary Fig. S22 for an exemplary region).

Due to the resampling step in Ti leShuffle, results may vary
between runs with different random number generator seeds. We
therefore plot the median of ﬁve different runs where the number
of permutations was set to 10000 for the one-state and 100 000
for the two-state analysis, and illustrate minimal and maximal
values as whiskers in x and y direction. Only negligible variation
in sensitivity and FDR is found for the most restrictive signiﬁcance
thresholds. This is an expected consequence of increasing variability
in sampling when the tails of the background distribution are
estimated. Hence, the numbers of required permutations of 10000
and 100 000 for the one-state and two-state analysis, respectively,
mark a sufﬁcient trade-off between running time and variation in
sensitivity and FDR. Due to the high degree of variation observed
for fold changes, the tails of the background distributions for two-
state analysis must be well estimated with an increased number
of permutations. We adapted the code for the two-state analysis
to ensure that a sufﬁciently large number of permutations can be
computed within a feasible time scale. On a single 2.66 GHz 64-
Bit Intel Xeon CPU, a one-state analysis of a single array under
the given parameters took approx. 12 h whereas a single two-state
analysis took around 9 h and 14 h with variant A and B, respectively.
Since an array comprises sufﬁcient information to sample from the
background distribution and hence eliminate array-wide effects, the
arrays can be analyzed independently from each other.

3.3 Detection of transcript structures

One of the advantages of tiling arrays over conventional expression
arrays is information on the intron—exon-structure of transcripts,
as probes are tiled in an unbiased way across the genome. We
manually inspected a small set of genes that are known to be
cell cycle regulated (Bar-Joseph et a1., 2008). In several cases,
we observed that TileShuf f le is capable of detecting a higher

fraction of exons of a transcript as highdiﬁ’ and identiﬁes the intron-
exon boundaries more accurately than TAS or MAT. Supplementary
Figure S21 displays examples of known cell cycle regulated genes
where the three algorithms perform remarkably different.

To substantiate this ﬁnding and to exclude that the above
mentioned observation is merely a consequence of the increased
sensitivity of Ti leShuf fle, we studied the accuracy in detecting
intron-exon boundaries on a global scale.

All unique exons of all protein-coding transcripts annotated
in GENCODE version 3c (Harrow et a1., 2006) were extracted,
resulting in 293 000 annotations. Highdiﬁ’ intervals of the G0/G1
transition of the cell cycle dataset were computed with all three
methods. To increase comparability, signiﬁcance thresholds were
adjusted to yield comparable FDR values, i.e., 18% FDR in case
of TAS (q=0.05), 17% in case of MAT (p: 1e-6), and 19% and
18% in case of TileShuffle variant A (q=0.05) and variant
B (q=0.1), respectively. For each method, the overall reported
nucleotides identiﬁed as highdiﬁ’ in the G0/G1 transition of the cell
cycle dataset including the absolute and relative base pair coverage
with GENCODE version 3c annotations is given in Supplementary
Table S5. The absolute number of reported nucleotides and their
length greatly differs among the methods (see Supplementary
Table S3). An analogous analysis for high intervals is shown in
Supplementary Tables S4 and S2.

We calculated the overlap of all tiling array intervals (either
highly expressed intervals or highdiﬁ’ intervals) with all annotated
exons no matter of the annotated reading strand direction for exons,
since strand information cannot be inferred from the Affymetrix
Human Tiling 1.0 array set. For each overlapping pair of tiling array
interval and annotated exon, the genomic distances between the
inferred and annotated 5’- and 3’-ends, respectively, are summarized
in an empirical cumulative distribution ﬁinction (ecdf). We do
not only include the pair with minimal distance but consider all
overlaps of several tiling array intervals with one exon, as well as
all overlaps of several exons with one tiling array interval in the
ecdf. This penalizes the distance distribution in cases where one
exon is represented by many small tiling array intervals. It also
penalizes intronic tiling array intervals that partly overlap with an
exon. Due to the higher sensitivity of TileShuf f 1e, the number
of regions included in this analysis is signiﬁcantly higher compared
with the other methods. We therefore normalize the ecdf to the total
number of overlaps of the respective method.

TileShuffle clearly outperforms the other two methods in
detecting exon—intron boundaries in highdiﬁ’ data (Fig. 4). The
results are more balanced for expression analysis, where TAS ﬁnds
a higher proportion of exons boundaries with an offset below the
window size of TileShuffle, while overall, TileShuffle
identiﬁes a higher proportion of boundaries (Supplementary
Fig. S9). Of all window sizes tested for TileShuffle, 200 bp
performs best. A window of 400 bp further extends exons and a
window size of 20 bp, i.e., comprising just one probe, shortens
exons remarkably. Different GC bins for the one-state analysis
do not have a considerable impact on exon boundary detection
(Supplementary Figs. Sl7—S20).

Supplementary Figures S10 and S11 ﬁlrther illustrate the
orientation in the offset to annotated exons. Both, for expression and
differential expression analysis, Ti leShuffle has a tendency to
extend the reported region beyond the exon boundaries with the
largest extension observed for long window sizes as, i.e., 400 bp.

Only every 10th data point is drawn as a symbol. For each method. the set of highdiﬁr intervals in the GO/Gl transition of the cell cycle tiling array dataset
is used as input dataset. The signiﬁcance thresholds of the three methods for differential analysis were adjusted to obtain similar FDRs as estimated before
using the custom microarray. i.e., 18% FDR in case of TAS ((120.05). 17% in case of MAT ([7:1e-6). and 19% and 18% in case of TileShuffle with
variant A ((120.05) and variant B ((120.1). respectively. The absolute number of overlaps is 15 835 and 13 479 with TileShuffle and variant A and B.

respectively. 4337 with TAS. and 2381 with MAT.

Again, if the window includes just one probe (window size set
to 20 bp), TileShuf f le tends to shorten exons (Supplementary
Figs. Sl7—S20). TAS and MAT tend to ﬁnd exons shorter than
annotated, caused by a comparable offset at 5’- and 3’-boundaries
in the case of expression analysis (Supplementary Fig. S10).
Boundaries of differentially expressed exons are hardly detected
correctly by TAS and MAT, but again with a tendency to shortening
(Supplementary Fig. S11). This bias in the offset to the correct
exon boundary is not unexpected: considering windows of length
200, TileShuffle will always extend expressed exons smaller
than the window size, which constitutes a signiﬁcant proportion
of exons in the human genome. TAS and MAT extend regions
probe-wise and thus can detect exons more precisely if the signal
across the exon is smooth. On the other hand, exon signals, strongly
affected by sequence-speciﬁc afﬁnities or cross-hybridization across
the exon, may prevent correct extension and lead to fragmentation
into several intervals or shortening. This may explain, why overall,
Ti leShuffle identiﬁes a greater proportion of boundaries.
Probe-wise extension largely fails in detecting highdi exons. The
expression difference signal is rugged and can reverse signs within
one exon. TileShuffle, which combines a robust windowing
approach and scoring function with ‘window-wise’ extension, is
clearly advantageous over the other methods that rely on probe-wise
extension only.

We ﬁnally investigated whether the observed differences in
detecting boundaries of highdiﬁ’ exons are biased by the selected
signiﬁcance thresholds. Over a range of q-value thresholds,
Ti leShuf f le displays only minor variation in the ecdf of
distances to exon boundaries and nearly constant results for
distances below the window size (Supplementary Figs S12 and
S13). In contrast, the ecdf of TAS and MAT vary strongly between
the different thresholds (Supplementary Figs S14 and S15) and

for signiﬁcance threshold < 0.5, TAS and MAT obtain signiﬁcantly
lower accuracies than TileShuffle at any q-value threshold.

4 CONCLUSION

Most published tiling array studies have focused on discovery
of novel expressed transcripts rather than unbiased detection of
differential expression and the choice of software for the latter task
is limited. Variants of the maxgap/minrun algorithm (Kampa et a1.,
2004; Royce et a1., 2005) like TAS require dataset-speciﬁc cutoff
parameters and MAT has been developed for ChIP-chip data analysis
and requires adapted parameters to be applicable to expression
tiling array data. Both hampers the applicability of these methods
in different scenarios without manually inspecting a small set of
expected positive regions.

We have presented TileShuf f 1e, a method speciﬁcally
designed for expression and differential expression analysis of
tiling array data. It implements a statistical approach to detect
expression or differential expression in terms of differences
from the background distribution that avoids any intensity-related
parameters. Ti leShuf f le reduces the most dominant tiling array
biases using an afﬁnity-dependent permutation in conjunction with a
windowing approach. A related resampling approach has been used
by Guttman et a1. (2009), which does, however, not consider probe
afﬁnities and is not applied to detection of differential expression.

We compared Ti leShuf f 1e, TAS, and MAT in two different
test scenarios. In the cell cycle dataset, where a custom array was
used for validiation, TileShuffle achieved signiﬁcantly lower
false discovery rates under equal sensitivities. This test scenario has
the advantages of building on a biologically meaningful experiment
with the associated noise in expression signals and transcriptome
complexity and of calculating sensitivity and speciﬁcity on a large
number of intervals. However, the custom array data has an FDR

itself, which is better controlled and signiﬁcantly lower than for the
tiling array, but still providing a surrogate for a true reference.

In the second scenario, the algorithms are compared using a
spike-in dataset (Sasaki et a1., 2007). The differences between
the three algorithms are smaller than in the previous scenario.
Ti leShuf fle, however, is the only one obtaining sensitivities
>50%. The spike-in experiment has the advantage of a clear
deﬁnition of positve and negative intervals for calculating
sensitivity and speciﬁcty. However — though large for a spike-
in experiment — 162 differentially expressed elements is a small
number compared with the cell cycle experiment, the noise is low,
the basal expression level is already high and a 10-fold differential
expression is a strong effect in biological experiments. The scenario
is thus rather artiﬁcial.

Apart from the ROCs, Ti leShuffle clearly outmatches TAS
and MAT in the recovery of transcript structures by identifying the
intron—exon structure more accurately. However, Ti leShuf f le
fails to detect very short exons because of the windowing approach.

Additionally, Ti leShuffle can incorporate replicate
experiments and supports input data as custom-formatted ﬁles and
hence is not dependent on any technology or tiling array design
and can also be applied to ChIP-chip data by selecting a larger
window size. The required computation time of Ti leShuf f le
is considerably higher than for TAS and MAT. However, it is
negligible compared with efforts for the genome-wide tiling array
experiment and thus does not constitute a bottleneck in the analysis
work ﬂow.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Antigenic cartography is a useful technique to visualize
and minimize errors in immunological data by projecting antigens
to 2D or 3D cartography. However, a 2D cartography may not be
sufficient to capture the antigenic relationship from high-dimensional
immunological data. AntigenMap 3D presents an online, interactive,
and robust 3D antigenic cartography construction and visualization
resource. AntigenMap 3D can be applied to identify antigenic variants
and vaccine strain candidates for pathogens with rapid antigenic
variations, such as influenza A virus.

1 INTRODUCTION

Antigenic variation is a common strategy for an infectious pathogen
to evade its host immunological response. The infectious pathogen
can alter its surface protein(s) so that it will not be recognized by
speciﬁc host antibody. As a result, the pathogen can reinfect the
same host. Antigenic variation can be either antigenic drift from
accumulating mutations or antigenic shift from exchanging surface
proteins from two different strains. For inﬂuenza A virus, antigenic
drift leads to seasonal epidemics and antigenic shift to pandemics.
Rapid detection of antigenic variant events and accurate
quantiﬁcation of antigenic variant extent are essential for selection of
an effective vaccine strain and development of a prompt vaccination
program. This has been especially important for inﬂuenza A virus,
as vaccination is the primary option for reducing the impacts of
inﬂuenza. The antigenic characterization in inﬂuenza virus are
performed using immunological assays, such as hemagglutinin
inhibition, microneutralization and enzyme-labeled immunosorbent
assays. However, analyses of these immunological data are not
trivial for the following reasons: (i) these assays are very crude and
much noise is present in these datasets; (ii) it is not uncommon that
there are empty entries in the resulting immunological tables; and
(iii) the data distribution in these datasets is unique, and unobserved
values are not distributed randomly in the tables, especially for
datasets that contain viruses with large isolation time intervals.
Antigenic cartography is an analog of geographic cartography in
presenting the antigens as 2D or 3D maps (Cai et (11., 2010; Cai et (11.,
2011; Liao et (11., 2009; Smith et (11., 2004). Antigenic cartography
has been shown to effectively detect inﬂuenza antigenic drift events;

therefore, cartography is useful in antigenic characterization and
vaccine strain selection (Ducatez et (11., 2011; Smith et (11., 2004;
Wan et (11., 2011). Antigenic cartography has become a standard tool
in inﬂuenza surveillance of the World Health Organization inﬂuenza
reference laboratories. Because 2D cartography may not be sufﬁcient
to capture the antigenic relationship from the high-dimensional
immunological data, we developed an antigenic cartography tool,
AntigenMap 3D, to construct 3D antigenic cartography.

2 METHODS

2.1 Antigenic cartography construction

Antigenic cartography construction was implemented in Java based on the
matrix completion-multiple dimensional scaling (MC-MDS) algorithm that
we described earlier (Cai at 611., 2010). Brieﬂy. the missing values and
error correlation was performed on the input immunological datasets using
an alternating gradient descent low rank matrix completion method. If a
temporal model is used. temporal regulation will be applied. Usually a
temporal model is used only when antigenic data span long temporal ranges.
such as H3N2 human inﬂuenza antigenic data described in Cai at 611., (2010).

2.2 Advantages of 3D maps

With multiple dimensional scaling. the 2D antigenic cartography reduces the
dimension number to two from immunological data (Cai at 611., 2010; Cai
at 611., 2011; Liao at 611., 2009; Smith at 611., 2004). However. 2D antigenic
cartography has a limitation in information retrieval. especially when the
dimension of two is not sufﬁcient to capture major components from the high-
dimensional immunological data. As a result. 2D may not be able to position
the antigens correctly. especially for those antigens with similar properties
in 1D but different properties in other dimensions. By moving to 3D space.
antigenic cartography will have a much greater capability to optimize the
positions on the map. thus a better accuracy in the resulting maps. In Figure
1. the 2D antigenic cartography was not able to display properly the antigenic
relationship for antigenic clusters SY97 and FU02. which can be displayed
properly in the 3D cartography by AntigenMap 3D. In addition. compared
with 2D cartography. AntigenMap 3D is interactive also. thus allowing
greater ﬂexibility in display and analysis. Because AntigenMap 3D generates
dynamic graphs. the user can reﬁne and zoom the View without generating
a new map. To facilitate the antigenic analysis. AntigenMap 3D provides
additional functions such as distance measurement. advanced grouping. and
View exporting to facilitate rapid analysis and antigenic variant detection.

2.3 Implementation and availability

AntigenMap 3D is written in Java and PHP and uses Jmol
(imolsourceforgenet) (Henaez. 2006) to display the 3D graph by
MC-MDS (Cai at 611., 2010). The front-end uses the XHTML 1.0 and
CSS 3 standards to ensure a consistent display across different platforms.
PHP is used to generate the dynamic pages and for data handling. The
computational backend implementing the MC-MDS algorithm is written in

Fig. 1. The inﬂuenza antigenic 2D (A) and 3D (B) cartography for H3N2 viruses from 1968 to 2003. The viruses labeled with the cluster names HK68,
EN72, V175, TX77, BK79, S187, BE89, BE92, WU95, SY97 and FU02 were adapted from Smith et a1. (2004). One grid in 2D map or one unit in 3D map
corresponds to a two-fold change in HI assay. The distance between antigen a and b in 2D cartography is similar to that in 3D cartography. However, the
distance between antigenic c and d is at least 1 unit shorter than that in 3D cartography.

Java. Also, AntigenMap 3D is designed with security in mind from the start
and includes strict input checking and sanitation.

AntigenMap 3D provides various options to construct antigenic maps,
including ﬁve normalization methods, ranks for optimization process, low
reactor cutoff and as to which modeling process. A temporal model is also
provided as an option. Users will input data and select the options they chose
and submit the information to the system. Users will select the colorization
and grouping of the antigens before proceeding to the display of the 3D
map. After the data have been processed, the user will be presented with the
antigenic map and the user can proceed to analyze and save the data.

AntigenMap 3D uses a customized version of Jmol to visualize the 3D
data generated by MC-MDS. The major changes to Jmol were in the user
interface, such as menu and display functions. The custom loading scripts
are generated based on the user’s input and instructs J mol on how to load and
display correctly the 3D data. The input ﬁle format is raw immunological
table/matrix and is processed by MC-MDS creating a customized Chemical
Markup Language (CML) ﬁle. The CML format was adapted to handle
antigenic data and is saveable by the user for later analysis.

AntigenMap 3D has been tested in Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer
on Windows and Firefox and Chrome on Linux.

3 SUMMARY

In summary, AntigenMap 3D provides a user-friendly and robust
online resource for antigenic map construction using immunological
datasets. Besides inﬂuenza viruses, AntigenMap 3D is also
potentially applicable in antigenic cartography construction for other
infectious antigens with signiﬁcant antigenic variations.

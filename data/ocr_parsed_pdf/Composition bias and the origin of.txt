ABSTRACT

Motivation: Intriguingly, sequence analysis of genomes reveals
that a large number of genes are unique to each organism. The
origin of these genes, termed ORFans, is not known. Here, we
explore the origin of ORFan genes by defining a simple measure
called ‘composition bias’, based on the deviation of the amino acid
composition of a given sequence from the average composition of
all proteins of a given genome.

Results: For a set of 47 prokaryotic genomes, we show that the
amino acid composition bias of real proteins, random ‘proteins’
(created by using the nucleotide frequencies of each genome) and
‘proteins’ translated from intergenic regions are distinct. For ORFans,
we observed a correlation between their composition bias and their
relative evolutionary age. Recent ORFan proteins have compositions
more similar to those of random ‘proteins’, while the compositions
of more ancient ORFan proteins are more similar to those of the
set of all proteins of the organism. This observation is consistent
with an evolutionary scenario wherein ORFan genes emerged and
underwent a large number of random mutations and selection,
eventually adapting to the composition preference of their organism
over time.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the consistent and intriguing observations that emerged from
the extensive availability of whole genome sequences is the large
number of genes that seem to encode unique proteins that do not exist
in other organisms or exist only in very closely related organisms.
This appears to be the case even when using sophisticated sequence
comparison methods like psi-blast. These genes are commonly
called ORFan genes (Fischer and Eisenberg, 1999) and the resulting
proteins are called ORFan proteins. It was estimated (Siew and
Fischer, 2004) that 20—30% of the open reading frames in a given
genome are ORFans. These observations were made early in the
history of genome analysis, when only the ﬁrst organisms had

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

been sequenced. At that time, the common explanation was that
these ‘unique’ genes were not unique at all, but that not enough
organisms had been sequenced to follow the evolution of these
genes. However, while the fraction of ORFan genes has somewhat
decreased as more genomes became available, it also became clear
that the phenomenon is not a mere artifact of a small sample size;
rather, even with the availability of the complete sequence of close
to a thousand genomes, there remain a large number of genes whose
evolutionary history is not accounted for.

Several possible explanations were given over the years for this
phenomenon (for a review see Daubin and Ochman, 2004; Long
et (11., 2003). One explanation is that those sequences are not real
genes; rather they may represent open reading frames that are never
expressed. However, several studies have shown (Siew and Fischer,
2003) that these genes are expressed, and some of the resulting
proteins have even been subjected to 3D structure analysis (Siew
and Fischer, 2004). Another possible explanation is that these genes
came from lateral gene transfer (LGT). In order for this explanation
to be logically relevant, the transfer should have come from genomes
whose sampling is sparse and thus can serve as a reservoir for the
unique genes. Viral and phage genomes have been suggested as
such a reservoir (Cortez et (11., 2009), although other recent studies
(Yin and Fischer, 2006) have indicated that LGT cannot be the
source for most of these genes. Another possibility that has been
suggested (Long et (11., 2003) is that ORFan genes originated from
ancestral genes, but because of fast evolutionary rate, these genes
have mutated their sequence to such an extent that their ancestors are
no longer recognizable. Yet another possibility is that some ORFan
genes emerged de novo from non-coding regions of each genome
without being inherited in the regular evolutionary path, for example
by shifting the reading frame, a phenomenon called overprinting (see
e.g. Delaye et (11., 2008) or by mutations that change non-coding
regions to open reading frames (Long et (11., 2003).

It is well known that protein sequences have different amino acids
compositions, i.e. not all of the 20 amino acids appear in proteins
with the same frequency of 5%. The composition is different for
different organisms (Pe’ er et (11., 2004) and has both evolutionary and
functional origin and consequences. Furthermore, within genomes,
different sequences have different compositions, and we term
the deviation of each sequence from the average composition of
the organism as composition bias. The composition of sequences
has been used as one of the main considerations in predicting
the sub-cellular localization of proteins (Nair and Rost, 2003).
Furthermore, it was observed (Ofran and Margalit, 2006) that

Origin of ORFan genes

 

proteins of the same fold but with unrelated sequences have similar
amino acid composition, and thus it was suggested that amino acid
composition can help to predict structural folds.

In an attempt to shed light on the evolutionary history of ORFan
proteins, we explored the composition bias of 47 prokaryotic
organisms. Using a simple measure, we compared the composition
bias of the set of all proteins, of random proteins (Section 2) and
of ORFan proteins in each genome. We show that the tendency of
ORFan proteins to behave like the rest of the proteins increases with
the evolutionary age of the ORFans, and we discuss the evolutionary
implications of this observation.

2 METHODS

Dataset: our dataset started with a collection of 66 representative prokaryotic
genomes (Yan and Moult, 2005). For these genomes, the sequences and
annotations were taken from NCBI. In each organism, ORFan genes were
deﬁned as genes that appear only in their genome-of-origin, and do not
have any similar genes based on a Blast run against the entire NCBI-NR
database. The parameters used to deﬁne a hit were E-Value <0.05, and
match-length that covers at least 50% of the ORFan length. Three organisms
were found to have another related organism with which they share many
proteins (Escherichia coli with Shigella, Methanococcus jannaschii with
Methanocaldococcus and Nostoc Sp PCC 7120 with Anabaena). For these
organisms, we considered genes as ORFans if they appeared only in their
original genome and in the very close relative.

The analysis presented here included the 47 genomes (out of the 66) that
have at least 25 ORFan genes each. The list includes 38 bacteria and 9 archaea
(see Supplementary Table S 1). All together, we identiﬁed 8812 ORFan genes
out of 123 444 genes (~7%) in our ensemble (Supplementary Table S2).

Real and random proteins: we called the set of all proteins in an organism
the set of ‘real proteins’. For each organism, three sets of random sequences
were created. Each set was matched to the set of real proteins in terms of
the number of proteins and the length of each protein. The three sets of
random sequences were created based on the nucleotide frequency (i.e. the
A/C/G/T ratios) of (i) the entire genome, (ii) of only the coding regions and
(iii) only of the non-coding regions. The nucleotide sequences were translated
to amino acid sequences. All sequences started with ATG, and to maintain
protein length, stop codons, when generated, were replaced by other random
codons.

Translating proteins from intergenic regions: nucleotide sequences that
came from intergenic regions of the genome (i.e. regions that are between
genes and do not reside on the opposite strand of coding regions) were
translated into proteins. Stop codons were skipped over and the subsequent
nucleotides were used to create additional codons such that the lengths
of these ‘proteins’ match those of the real proteins. Since the number of
intergenic regions in prokaryotic genomes is limited, the set sampled was
1/3 the number of proteins in each genome.

Translating antisense proteins: for each protein, the antisense sequence
(i.e. its reverse complement sequence) was also translated. Thus, the size of
this set of proteins was the same as that of the real proteins in each genome.
Stop codons were skipped over.

Calculating composition bias: for each organism, a reference composition
vector was calculated by averaging the percentage of each of the 20 amino
acids in each protein over all real proteins of the genome according to NCBI
annotation. For each amino acid, the SD about the average composition was
also determined. For each amino acid sequence X, the composition bias 0‘ was
calculated by comparing its composition vector to the reference composition

vector according to:
Z If" -f»’|
CS 2 # 1
SD,r ( )

i
Where i ranges over the 20 amino acids, fl." is the i-th component of
the composition vector of the given sequence, fir is the i-th component of

the reference composition vector and SD; is the standard deviation of the
reference composition of the i-th amino acid about its average. Thus, each
‘protein’ is assigned a composition bias, and for a set of ‘proteins’ in a given
organism, we created a histogram of these composition biases, showing for
each composition bias bin (in the range of 0%0), the fraction of the proteins
in this bin. The histogram is presented as a continuous line. For the ORFan
proteins, the histogram was scaled up by a factor based on the fraction of
ORFan proteins. For example, if an organism has 4000 proteins of which
400 are ORFans, then the values in the ORFan histogram were scaled up by
a factor of 10 (4000/400).

We have also compared the frequency vector of the given sequence to
that of the reference vector using a root mean square (RMS) measure. The
RMS measure square the difference in the frequency of corresponding amino
acids without normalization to the SD weight that appear in Equation (1).
The results of using these two measures were similar and thus in this article
we show only the results of the ﬁrst measure.

Calculating the difference between histograms of composition biases: the
difference between the histograms was calculated as the difference between
the average values of each histogram. We also measured the difference by
computing the overlap between the two histograms. We then calculated the
ratio between the overlap of the ORFans and real protein and the overlap
of the ORFans and the random proteins. This ratio reﬂects the relatedness
between the ORFan proteins to either the real proteins (low ratio values) or
the random proteins (high ratio values).

Phylogenetic tree construction and measuring the relative age of ORFans:
since ORFan genes are found in only a single branch of the phylogenetic tree,
they must have emerged subsequent to the split of that branch. The maximum
age of the ORFan genes must be smaller than the age of the organism, and
thus it assumed to be proportional to the relative length of their terminal
branch (Supplementary Figure S1). This length was used to estimate the
approximate relative age of the ORFan.

The tree was constructed incorporating information from accepted amino
acid substitutions per site between species in a large set of protein families,
to avoid bias issues encountered in methods where only a small number of
families is used. The set of orthologous protein domain families previously
constructed (Yan and Moult, 2005) from 66 prokaryotic genomes was
used. Multiple sequence alignments for each family were generated using
MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004). The estimated accepted amino acid substitutions
per site between each pair of domains ‘i’ and ‘j’ in each family ‘u’, S(i,j,u)
were then obtained using the PROTDIST module in PHYLIP (Felsenstein,
1989) with the J onesiTayloriThornton amino acid substitution matrix (Jones
at (11., 1992).

The numbers of accepted substitutions per site for each family were placed
on the same scale by comparison with the average rates of substitution
Srgf(i,j) between genomes ‘i’ and ‘j’ in a set of 14 highly conserved families.
The rate of sequence change for each family, C(11), relative the reference set
was obtained using a robust least median square procedure (Rousseeuw and
Leroy, 1987), ﬁnding the C(11) which minimizes the median value of the set
[r(i,j,u)2], where

run]; it? = {3021 u>/C(u> — Satin?

and the set includes contributions from all pairs of genomes ‘i’ and ‘j’ with
members in family ‘u’ (Yan, 2005). A robust method was necessary to avoid
distortions of C(11) arising from anomalous S(i,j,u) values caused by LGT
and other factors.

The intergenome distance, D(i,j), between each pair of genomes ‘i’
and ‘j’ was estimated using D(i,j)=<S(i,j,u)/C(u)>,, where the average
includes contributions from all families with members in genomes ‘i’ and 
A phylogenetic tree was then built from this distance matrix, using the
neighbor joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987), as implemented in PHYLIP.

Correlations were calculated using the standard Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient comparing the two properties of interest (e.g. number of ORFans
and relative age) for each of the 47 genomes.

3 RESULTS

The list of the genomes and the number of proteins and ORFan
proteins in each genome is given in Supplementary Table S1. We
started by calculating the composition bias of the proteins translated
from the coding genes, from random ‘genes’ (based on the nucleotide
frequency of the entire genome), from the antisense strands of the
coding genes and from the intergenic regions of the genome. The
histograms (Section 2) of the composition biases are shown in
Figure 1 for six organisms: E.coli. Rickettsia conorii, Treponema
pallidum, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Aeropyrum pemix and
Clostridium acetobutylicum. As the number of sequences in the
intergenic sets is 1/3 of those of the other sets (Section 2), their
histograms were normalized by multiplying each value by 3. The
real proteins have smaller composition bias (as is evident from the
fact that their histogram is the leftmost) than the composition bias
of the random proteins. This is expected since the compositions
are compared with the average compositions of the real proteins.
Surprisingly, the composition bias of the antisense proteins is
greater than that of the random proteins. We also note that for all
organisms the composition bias histogram of ‘proteins’ translated
from intergenic regions are ﬁirther shifted to the right.

We next compared the composition bias of ORFan proteins to that
of the other datasets. Figure 2 shows the composition bias histograms
of real proteins, random proteins and ORFan proteins (scaled up to
the size of the other groups) for several genomes. We noticed that
ORFan proteins from different species behave differently in their
similarity to either the coding or the random groups. The ORFans of
E. coli and R. conorii look like random proteins (Fig. 2a), the ORFans

Fig. 1. Histograms showing the composition bias for six organisms of
several sets of proteins. All histograms were computed by using the average
composition vector of the real proteins as the reference, and the composition
bias of each protein relative to that reference was calculated. As expected,
the real proteins have the smallest bias. Surprisingly, the composition bias of
intergenic ‘proteins’ is signiﬁcantly larger than that of random or antisense
proteins. For the random genes, very similar results were obtained when
using either the genome’s coding or non-coding frequencies.

of Treponemapallidum andAeropyrumpernix resemble real proteins
(Fig. 2c) while the ORFan proteins of Corynebacterium glutamicum
and Clostridium acetobutylicum have intermediate assignments
(Fig. 2b).

From the results of the calculations for all 47 organisms, we
noticed that indeed there is a range in the similarity of the
composition bias between the ORFan proteins and the real and
random proteins. In an effort to understand this range, we looked at
the relative age of the ORFans, as determined by the phylogenetic
tree (Section 2), as a possible explanation.

First, we checked the correlation between the number of ORFans
in each genome and their relative age, and found a weak correlation
(0.36). A more signiﬁcant correlation (0.5) was found between the
relative age of the ORFans and the percentage of ORFan genes from
the total number of coding genes in the organism (see scatter plots
in Supplementary Figure S2).

Next, we found a surprising strong correlation coefﬁcient of 0.59
between the relative age of the ORFans and the distance between the
average composition bias of the ORFan and the random proteins.
Similarly, the correlation coefﬁcient between the relative age and
the distance between the average composition bias of the ORFan
and the real proteins is —0.66 (see scatter plots in Supplementary
Figures S3a and b). To make sure that these high correlations are not
dependent on the particular way of comparing the composition bias,
we also calculated the correlation between the relative age and the
ratio of the overlaps (Section 2) and got similar results (correlation
coefﬁcient of —0.58, see Supplementary Figure S3c).

compared with the composition bias of all proteins and of random proteins
for six organisms. Since there are fewer ORFan proteins, their histograms
were scaled up accordingly (the results were validated to ensure that they
are not due to sampling effects). In the two examples in the top panel (a),
the ORFan proteins behave like random proteins; in the two examples in the
bottom panel (c), the ORFans behave like the real proteins; and the behavior
of the examples in the middle panel (b) is intermediate.

Origin of ORFan genes

 

4 DISCUSSION

The main ﬁnding of this study is the correlation between the
relative age of the ORFans and the degree of similarity of their
composition to that of the real proteins of the organism. We found
a signiﬁcant correlation (correlation coefﬁcients between 0.58 and
0.66) between the relative age of the ORFans and their composition
bias, as determined by various measures of the composition distance
between the set of the ORFan proteins and the set of real proteins.
Thus, the older the ORFans, i.e., the more ancient the organism,
the more the amino acid composition of its ORFans resembles that
of the rest of the proteins. Young organisms, i.e. organisms that
split from their ancestor organisms more recently, tend to have
ORFan genes with composition that is more different from that of
the rest of the proteins, and more similar to that of the random
genes.

We tested to see if there are other factors that correlate with the
relative age of the ORFan proteins and with the composition bias.
As expected, we found that the fraction of ORFan genes among all
coding genes in each organism is correlated with the evolutionary
age of the organism (correlation coefﬁcient of 0.5). Older organisms
that have, almost by deﬁnition, fewer close relatives, tend to have
more ORFan genes. No other factors that we tested, including the
GC content of the organism, the size of the genome and the ratio
of coding to intergenic regions, showed a strong correlation (<0.3)
with the ORFan behavior.

Thus, our data are consistent with a model wherein ORFan
genes emerged with a composition that was similar to the random
composition of the genome. Then, during evolution and due to
the selective pressures that shape the composition bias of each
organism, the composition of ORFan genes gradually converged to
be more similar to the composition of the rest of the proteins of the
genome.

We may examine the three possible explanations for the origin
of ORFan genes in light of this observation. The ﬁrst explanation
is that ORFan genes originated from bacteriophages (see a review
in Daubin and Ochman, 2004). We think that this is unlikely.
First, note that bacterial genes that have known homologues in
bacteriophage are not considered ORFans by our deﬁnition. Second,
for six bacteria for which sufﬁcient bacteriophages have been
sequenced, we compared the composition of the ORFan genes
with the composition of bacteriophage proteins and found that the
composition of the ORFan genes of the bacteria is not similar to
the composition of the bacteriophage proteins (see Supplementary
Figure S4).

The second possible explanation is that ORFan genes emerged
de novo from non-coding regions of the genome (see a review in
Long et (11., 2003). This is also not consistent with our observation
that protein created from intergenic sequences are distinct (ﬁirther
to the right in Fig. 1) from the random proteins, while the ORFan
proteins fall between the random and the real proteins. If ORFan
proteins emerged from intergenic regions, then we would expect
the ORFan genes to behave more closely to intergenic non-coding
regions of the genome, and not like random sequences.

The third explanation is that ORFan genes result from a very fast
evolutionary clock rate of mutations operating on genes that are

under positive selection (Long et (11., 2003). This explanation is the
most consistent with our observations. Random mutations are likely
to create nucleotide sequences that have A/C/G/T frequencies that
are similar to random sequences, thus creating novel proteins whose
amino acid sequences have composition bias similar to the random
proteins that we have created. Over time, the sequences underwent
further mutations and selection that changed their composition and
brought their composition bias to be more similar to that of the rest
of the proteins.

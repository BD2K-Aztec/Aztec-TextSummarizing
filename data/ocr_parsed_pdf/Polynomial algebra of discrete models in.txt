ABSTRACT

Motivation: An increasing number of discrete mathematical models
are being published in Systems Biology, ranging from Boolean
network models to logical models and Petri nets. They are used
to model a variety of biochemical networks, such as metabolic
networks, gene regulatory networks and signal transduction
networks. There is increasing evidence that such models can capture
key dynamic features of biological networks and can be used
successfully for hypothesis generation.

Results: This article provides a unified framework that can aid the
mathematical analysis of Boolean network models, logical models
and Petri nets. They can be represented as polynomial dynamical
systems, which allows the use of a variety of mathematical tools
from computer algebra for their analysis. Algorithms are presented
for the translation into polynomial dynamical systems. Examples are
given of how polynomial algebra can be used for the model analysis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Finite dynamical systems, that is, discrete dynamical systems with a
ﬁnite state space, have been used extensively in systems biology
to model a variety of biochemical networks, such as metabolic
networks, gene regulatory networks and signal transduction
networks. For many such networks, the available data quantity
and quality is not sufﬁcient to build detailed quantitative models
such as systems of ordinary differential equations, which require
many parameters that are frequently unknown. In addition, discrete
models tend to be more intuitive and easily accessible to life
scientists. There is ample evidence that such models can capture
key dynamic features of biological networks and can be used
successfully for hypothesis generation (G.Bhardwaj et al., submitted
for publication; Saez-Rodriguez et al., 2009). Boolean networks
and their generalization, the so-called multistate logical models
(Thomas, 1973; Thomas and D’Ari, 1989), are the main types
of ﬁnite dynamical systems that have been used successfully in
modeling biological networks (e.g. Albert and Othmer, 2003; Barrett
et al., 2005; Espinosa—Soto et al., 2004; Faure et al., 2006; Li et al.,
2004; Mendoza et al., 1999; Saez-Rodriguez et al., 2009; Samal and
Jain, 2008). Petri nets have also been shown to be a good modeling

paradigm for this ﬁeld (e.g. Chaouiya et al., 2008; Formanowicz
et al., 2007; Grunwald et al., 2008; Kielbassa et al., 2009). Together,
these model types represent a large Class of discrete models in
systems biology, which are capable of simulating deterministic as
well as stochastic processes.

Several tools and techniques have been developed to simulate
and analyze discrete models. For logical models, the open-source
software GINsim (http://gin.univ-mrs.fr) is available, and for Petri
nets, the user has access to a wide variety of software. The
laboratory of M. Heiner provides software with a particular focus
on applications to systems biology (http://www-dssz.informatik.tu-
cottbus.de/). Analysis tools for logical models, including Boolean
networks, are described in Naldi et al. (2007). In addition to a variety
of simulation and visualization tools, other graph theoretic analysis
tools are available for the identiﬁcation of steady states and strongly
connected components of the regulatory graph. There are algorithms
to compute dead states (steady states), as well as T- and P-invariants,
which can be computed via linear algebra methods. A survey of the
use of Petri nets in systems biology is given by Peleg et al. (2005).

The purpose of this article is to describe a mathematical
framework that encompasses both types of models and makes
accessible a broad range of mathematical tools for model analysis,
in order to complement existing tools in these domain areas. The
fundamental observation underlying this framework is that logical
models and k-bounded Petri nets are particular instantiations of
what we shall call ‘algebraic models,’ i.e. time—discrete dynamical
systems

f=(fl,...,fn):]F"—>]F"

where each coordinate function fl- is a ﬁinction of the 11 variables
x1,...,xn, each of which takes on values in a ﬁnite set 1F with
algebraic structure, and each fl- is a polynomial. Aside from the
mathematical simplicity of their deﬁnition, an important feature of
polynomial dynamical systems is that one can employ a number of
mathematical tools for their analysis. For our purposes, the principle
tool is the capability to symbolically solve systems of nonlinear
polynomial equations quite efﬁciently. This can be used, for instance,
to compute the steady states and other features of an algebraic model.

We give algorithms that translate both logical models and Petri
nets into this framework. Our algorithms are compatible with the
algorithm in Chaouiya et al. (2008), which translates logical models
into Petri nets. We ﬁlrthermore provide several examples, using
models from the literature, of how this translation can be used to
analyze their dynamic properties.

The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we brieﬂy
describe polynomial dynamical systems (PDSs). We then show how
to use the algebraic framework in the analysis of logical models and

k-bounded Petri nets in Sections 3 and 4, respectively; ﬁirthermore,
we present concrete examples for each. We close with a discussion
in Section 5.

2 METHOD

We consider models of biological systems. such as biochemical networks
with n interacting molecular species. whose states can be described by an
n-tuple with entries from a ﬁnite set IT. The model consists of a set of rules
that allow the system to evolve from one state to the next. so that it can be
represented as a timeAliscrete dynamical system f : 1F” —> IF”. Both logical
models and k-bounded Petri nets are of this form. For example. in a model
of a gene regulatory network. the set IE‘ is {0,1}. representing the state of a
gene as either ON (1) or OFF (0).

If we consider f only as a set function. then there are few mathematical
tools that can help to analyze f . One way to introduce mathematical structure.
and thereby mathematical tools to study f . is by imposing the structure of a
number system on IT. akin to the introduction of a coordinate system in afﬁne
space. which gives access to analytical methods in geometry. It can be shown
that this can be done whenever the cardinality of IE‘ is a power of a prime
number. and we will show in this article that it can always be accomplished
in the cases of interest here (we will consider |1F| to be a prime number to
simplify the notations).

It is worth pointing out that this algebraic structure is used heavily in the
case of Boolean networks. The evaluation of Boolean functions uses the fact
that IF = {0, 1} is equipped with an addition. where O is the additive identity.
and with a multiplication. where 1 is the multiplicative identity. The two are
connected through the rule 1 + 1 = 0.

Once 1F carries such a structure. we can make use of a fundamental
property of ﬁnite ﬁelds: Let h:]F”—>]F be a function. Then. there exists
a polynomial g: 1F” —> IF such that h(x) = g(x) for all x 6 IF”. One can
ﬁnd g using the formula g(x)=zce]Fn h(c)]_['-‘:l(1 —(xj—cj)1’_l). where
the right-hand side is computed modulo [7. We will write h. h(x) or
Zcan h(c)]_[]'-‘:l(1—(xj—cj)p_l). depending whether or not there is the
need to specify x or the polynomial form of h.

Thus. we can represent f via its coordinate functions: f =(fl , . . . ,fn):
1F” —> IF”, where each ﬂ is a polynomial function. so that evaluation and
analysis of f can be done using polynomial arithmetic over IT. We shall call f
a PDS over 1F of dimension n. In the next sections. we will show that logical
models and bounded Petri nets can be represented as PDSs. One can then
use powerful symbolic computation software. from open source specialty
packages such as CoCoA (http://cocoa.dima.unige.it/). Singular (http://www
.singular.uni-kl.de) and MacaulayZ (http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2)
to general commercial packages such as Mathematica and Maple. In this
article. we will use MacaulayZ for all computations.

3 ALGORITHM FOR LOGICAL MODELS

Logical models have been used for modeling biological phenomena
and have been useful for obtaining valuable insight and qualitative
information (Thomas and D’Ari, 1989). Such analysis is based
on the topology of the network and the type of regulation of the
different interactions in the network, which are believed to be the key
features that determine dynamical properties (Albert and Othmer,
2003; Thomas and D’Ari, 1989). Logical models have the advantage
of being intuitive and relatively simple to construct, even with no
information about reaction rates or functionality, and still keeping
qualitative information (Albert and Othmer, 2003). However, their
analysis is not a trivial task. For example, the problem of ﬁnding the
steady states of a logical model is NP-complete, that is, it is one of
the hardest problems in the nondeterministic polynomial-time class
(even to determine the existence of steady states is NP-complete;
Zhao, 2005).

3.1 Deﬁnition of logical models

There are several ways to deﬁne logical models (Chaouiya et al.,
2008; Comet et al., 2005; Naldi et al., 2007), and here we use the
deﬁnition given in Naldi et al. (2007).

DEFINITION 3.1. A logical model is a triple (12.8.10, where:

(1) V={v1,...,vn} is the set of vertices or nodes. Each v,- has
a maximum expression level, mi. The set S=[0,m1] ><  ><
[0,mn] (Cartesian product) is called the state space of the
logical model and its elements are called states.

(2) 8 is the set of arcs. The elements of 8 have the form (vi, vjﬁ),
where 1 3 63m,- is called a thresholdfor (vi,vj). Let I(j)=
{v:(v,vj,6)68}, called input of vj, be the set of vertices
that have an edge ending in vj. Notice that an arc (vi,vj)
is allowed to have multiplicity corresponding to diﬁ’erent
thresholds; the number of thresholds is denoted by migj. The
thresholds are indexed in increasing order, 1 36,-, 131 <--- <
Qigjgmw gmi; Qiﬁjgk is the k-th thresholdfor the arc (vi,vj). By
convention, we deﬁne 61-Januny =ml- +1 (actually, 61-Januny
can be deﬁned as any number greater than mi) and 6mg = 0.
Let x=(x1, ...,x,,) be a state; we say that the k-th interaction
for input v,- of vj is active if diijgk Ex,- <61; j, k+1; we denote
this by Oi’j(xi)=k.

(3) IC={Ki:]_[vaZ(l-)[0,mjsi]—>[0,mi],i=1,...n} is the set of
parameters.

Consider a state x=(x1...,x,,). The ﬁiture value for node
vi, with I(i)={vil,...,vir}, is determined as follows: compute
®i(x,-l,...,xir)=(@ihi(xil),...,®i“i(xir))=(k1,...,kr), indicating
that the kj-th interaction for input vi], of v,- is active; then compute
ﬁ(x>=K.-(ki.....kr).

This last value determines whether the value of v,- tends to
increase, decrease or remain the same. To be precise, the ﬁiture
value of v,- is given by
gig): pa.» xx». where

t+1, ifu>t
p(t.u)= t, ifu=t
t—1, ifu<t

With this notation, g=(g1,...,gn):S—>S is a ﬁnite dynamical
system, and so isf=(fl,...,fn):S—>S. Notice that g ensures that
each variable changes at most one unit (continuity), whereas f does
not.

The dynamics of a logical model is given by the phase space,
deﬁned as the graph 8 with an edge from x to y if {i :xl- #yj} = {j}
for some j and yj = gj (x) (asynchronous dynamics) or as the graph 8
with an edge from x to y if y = g(x) (synchronous dynamics). Notice
that g may be replaced by f if we do not require continuity.

An edge i—> j is called positive (negative) if increasing the i-th
entry of x causes gl- (x) to increase (decrease) using the natural order
on the integer sets [0,mi]. If changing the i-th entry of x does not
cause any change in gi(x), we say that the edge is nonﬁinctional.

3.2 Polynomial form of logical models

Let (12,8 ,IC) be a logical model as above. Choose a prime number
p such that pgmi +1 for all If ifn ([0,m,-] has m,- +1 elements)

and let 1F=1Fp= {0, 1, ...,p— 1} be the ﬁeld with p elements. Note
that we may consider 8 g 1F".

Consider a vertex v,- and let gl- (or fl- if we do not require continuity)
be its coordinate function. Our goal is to represent gl- as a polynomial
in terms of its inputs, say xi1,...,xir. That is, we need a polynomial
ﬁinction deﬁned on F’ with values in 1F. Denote a/\b=min{a,b},
using the natural order on the set 1F, viewed as integers. To extend the
domain ofgl- from nv/EIU) [0, mjsi] to Fr, we deﬁne gl-(xl-l , ,xl-r ) =
gl-(xl-l Am,-l , ...,xl-r Amt-r) for (in , ...,xir)e]Fr. The polynomial form
ofgl-ler—HF is then

gi(x)= Z gi(c.-,.....c.-,) H (1—(xj—cjr‘1t
(6,1,...,c,-,)EIF’ v/EIU)

where the right-hand side is computed modulo p.

REMARK 3.2. Many published logical models are Boolean, i.e.
m,- = 1 for all i. In this case, we can write gl- =fl- nicely and explicitly
in terms of the parameters:

gi(x)= Z MAI—[x]~ n (l—xj).

EXAMPLE 3.3. Consider a Boolean logical model where
x2,x3,x4 regulate x1, i.e. I(1)={2,3,4}. Suppose that K1({})=
K1({3}):K1({4})=K1({3,4})=1 and K1(J)=0 in all other
cases. Using Remark 3.2, the polynomial form of g1 is g1(x)=
(1—x2)(1—x3)(1—x4>+(1—x2)x3(1—x4)+(1—x2)(1—x3)x4+
x3(1—x2)x4, which simpliﬁes to g1 = 1+x2.

3.3 Example

This example is based on a simpliﬁed model for the Drosophila cell
cycle ﬁrst presented in Chaouiya et al. (2004). The Boolean logical
model is given in Figure 1 and Table 1.

Let x1=MPF, x2=Fizzy, x3=Wee1, x4=String. Notice that
according to the network, g1 depends on x2, x3 and x4; i.e. g1(x)=
g1(x2,x3,x4). The polynomial functions are: g1(x)= 1+x2, g2(x)=
xlig3(x)=1+xli and g4(x)=x1.

It follows that Wee1 —> MPF and String —> MPF are nonﬁinctional
edges; i.e. changes in Wee1 or String do not affect MPF. Hence
the network has only one functional (negative) circuit (see the

Supplementary Material for a formal deﬁnition of functional circuit),
rather than the three assumed in Chaouiya et al. (2004). In the
transition from the complete model to the simpliﬁed model, some
functionality may be lost and the algebraic framework can easily
detect this. This is important because in order to deduce dynamical
properties from the network structure it is necessary to have the
correct wiring diagram.

In Property 10 in Chaouiya et al. (2004), it is shown that the
logical model has no steady states (this was done by proving that an
equivalent Petri net is deadlock free). Algebraically, however, this
corresponds to solving the system of equations

1+x2=x1,x1=x2,1+x1=x3,x1=x4,

which has no solution, as the ﬁrst two equations imply that x2:
x2 +1, showing that there are no steady states.

3.4 Algebra and parameters

An important feature of the algebraic framework is the ability to treat
the parameters as variables and study all corresponding models at
the same time, which we illustrate with a small logical model. (The
same analysis can be done for Petri nets.)

Suppose, for example, that in the model for the Drosophila cell
cycle (Section 3.3) some parameters are unknown.

The polynomial form of the logical model is: g1 =1+x2+x3 +
[(1)63 +XZX3 +K1XZX3 +K3X2X4 +K1X3X4 +KZX3X4 +K1XZX3X4
+K2x2x3x4 +K3x2x3x4, g2=x1, g3 =1+x1, and g4=x1. For the
derivation of these equations, see the Supplementary Material.

Now, let us focus on ﬁnding steady states of this logical model.
This model has three unknown parameters, and if we were to analyze
each model, we would have to analyze 23 =8 logical models, as
the complexity grows exponentially with respect to the number of
unknown parameters. However, using the algebraic framework we
can treat the parameters K1,K2,K3 as variables and analyze the eight
models at the same time.

Using polynomial algebra (see Supplementary Material), we ﬁnd
that an equivalent system is

K1(K3—l)=0, X4(K3— l)=0, K1(X4—l)=0,
X3+X4—l=0, x2+x4=0, x1+x4=0.

From this system, we can obtain valuable information. For
example, if x is a steady state, then x1=x2=x4=x3 — 1; that is,
the only possible steady states are (0,0, 1,0) and (1, 1,0, 1). This is
true no matter what the parameters K1,K2 and K3 are.

We can also easily solve this system and see the steady states
for any choice of parameters. For example, consider K1 = 1,K3 = 0.
Since they do not satisfy the ﬁrst equation, there are no steady states.

1, . . . , 5. The networks used were: ﬁssion yeast (Davidich and Bornholdt, 2007), budding
yeast (Li et al., 2004), Th cell differentiation (Remy et al., 2006), Th cell differentiation
(Mendoza, 2006), Th cell differentiation (Mendoza and Xenarios, 2006), T-cell receptor
(Klamt et al., 2006), respectively. All networks were Boolean except the fourth one
which had some nodes with three states.

Consider K1 =K2 =K3 = 0; we have the system
x4=07x3=1—X4iX2=X4ixi =X4.

which has the unique steady state x: (0,0, 1,0).

We can also use the system above to determine for which
choice of parameters a given state is a steady state of the system.
For example, suppose we are interested in ﬁnding the parameters
for which (0,0,1,0) is a steady state, then we have the system
K1 (K3 — 1) =0,0(K3 — 1) =0,K1 = 0; therefore, K1 :0 and the other
parameters are ‘free.’ Hence, (0,0,1,0) is a steady state for K =
(0.1971(3).

Suppose now we are interested in ﬁnding the parameters for
which (1,1,0, 1) is a steady state. In this case, we have the system
K1(K3 — 1)=0,K3 —1=0,K1=0;i.e.K1=0,K3 = 1 and K2 is free.
Hence, (1, 1,0, 1) is a steady state for K: (0,K2, 1) (note that in this
case (0,0, 1,0) is a steady state as well).

3.5 Performance

We tested our algorithm to compute steady states of several
published models, that is, we recorded the required time for
computing a lexicographic Grobner basis (which then allows
backward substitution to solve the system of equations f1 (x) — x1 = 0,
..., f" (x)—x,; :0.) The results are shown in Table 3. Furthermore,
to compute limit cycles (using a parallel update) of length r,
one can compute the lexicographic Grobner basis for the system
ff(x)—x1=0, ...,frf(x)—xn :0, where t: 1,..., r. It is clear that the
solution set for t=1 is the set of steady states; the states in the
solution set for t :2, which are not steady states, are periodic states
with period two and so on.

Notice that in Table 3, the size of the network does not seem
to be correlated to the computation time. This is due to the fact
that polynomial algebra computations depend more strongly on the
complexity of the polynomial equations and not as much on the
size or complexity of the logical model. This means that the method
can scale well to large networks and that it can complement other
methods very well. (Typically, the more terms the polynomial form
of the model has the more complex the Grobner basis calculation. In
the Boolean case, for instance, a conjunction leads to a polynomial
with one term, whereas a disjunction results in three terms.)

4 ALGORITHM FOR K-BOUNDED PETRI NETS

4.1 Deﬁnition of Petri nets
A k-bounded Petri net is a 4-tuple (S ,T,F , W), where:

(1) S={s1,...,sn} is the set ofplaces.
(2) T={t1, ...,tm} is the set of transitions.

(3) Fg (S X T)U(T X S) is the set of ‘regular’ arcs. FT g (S X T)
is the set of inhibitory arcs.

(4) W:F—>N gives the arc weights of the regular arcs. W_:
F T —> N gives the arc weights of the inhibitory arcs.

For a transition t, deﬁne

ot={seS:(s,t)eF}, to={seS:(t,s)eF}, t={seS:(s,t)eF_}.

The incidence matrix A=(a;s);efﬁseg (or A=(a;-j);'fji:1) is an
m X n matrix given by as; = W(t, s) — W(s,t) (we consider W(e) :0
when e ¢F). We denote by A; the column of AT (or the row of A)
corresponding to a transition t e T. Notice that A; =AT U ;, where the
entry of U; corresponding to t is 1 and all others are 0.

An assignment x= (xs)seg EN" [or x=(x1,...,x,,)] for all places
is called a marking. Let x be a marking; a transition t is said to be
enabled if W(s, t) 3 x5 for all s e at and x5 3 WT (s, t) —1 for all s 6t.
Consider the function C;(x), deﬁned by

C( ) 1,ifW(s,t)§xS fOISEOI ande<W_(s,t) forset,
x =

t 0, otherwise.

Thus, a transition t is enabled for x if C; (x) = 1.

The evolution of the Petri net is given by ﬁring transitions; by
ﬁring an enabled transition t, we update the value of the places with
regular arcs from/to t. The phase space of the Petri net is obtained
by ﬁring transitions in an asynchronous manner. Let x be a marking:
if a transition t is enabled, then ﬁring t results in the marking x+A;.
This implies that for any marking x and any transition t, the Petri
net can always evolve from x to f;(x)=x+ C;(x)A;=x+ C;ATU;
(If C;(x)=0, then f;(x)=x; but if C;(x): 1, then f;(x)=x+A; =
x+ATU;). In the case where x 75y=f;(x) we write x; y. Denote
by fT the ﬁinction obtained by composing f;l o - - - of;,, where t1,...,t;

are the elements of ’7'. A trajectory is a path x t—l> y  --- and denoted

by xL. For any trajectory xLy we have y=x+ATZtETU;.
The reachability graph for a marking x is the graph made up of all
trajectories starting at x. The reachability graph of a set of markings
S is the graph made up of all reachability graphs of all the elements
of S.

We say that (X1,...,Xm)>0 if X;30 and at least for one i we
have X;- > 0. A P-invariant is an integer solution, X > 0, of AX :0.
A T-invariant is an integer solution, Y > 0, of ATY :0. A marking
x is dead if no transition is enabled, that is, if C;(x): 0 for all t e T;
this is equivalent to f;(x) =x for all t e T.

A marking is k-bounded if the value of each place is at most k.
The Petri net is k-bounded if any reachable marking (obtained by
ﬁring some sequence of transitions) from any k-bounded marking is
also a k-bounded marking, that is, if {x :x; f k} contains the vertices
of its reachability graph, which is equivalent to f;([0,k]")§ [0,k]"
for all transitions t. Examples of 1-bounded Petri nets are Boolean
regulatory Petri nets, presented in Chaouiya et al. (2004); Remy et al.
(2006); Steggles et al. (2007, 2006). When each place has its own
‘k’, we have a more general deﬁnition: forK = (k1 , . . . , kn), a Petri net

is K-bounded iff;([0,k1] ><  >< [0,kn]) g [0,k1] ><  >< [0,kn] for all
transitions t. Examples of such Petri nets are multi-level regulatory
Petri nets, presented in (Chaouiya et al., 2008; Comet et al., 2005).
Our framework is applicable to K-bounded Petri nets (including
k-bounded Petri nets).

For a given Petri net, the analysis of its dynamics, checking
for dead markings and the type of liveness are some of the
typical questions that can be viewed as algebraically as we will
see next. Also, when modeling biological systems, there is not a
unique marking that is of interest, but a whole family of markings
corresponding to different initial states of the biological system. By
looking at a Petri net as a polynomial dynamical system, we can
study all those markings at the same time.

4.2 Polynomial form of K -bounded Petri nets

Since the algebraic framework relies on ﬁnite ﬁelds, we consider
K -bounded Petri nets and focus on the analysis of markings in S =
[0,k1] >< --- >< [0,kn]. Letp be a prime number such that k;- + 1 3p for
all i and let 1F=1Fp. Then, for all teT,f; 25‘an —> 1F".

We need to extend the ﬁinctions f; to all of 1F" and determine

their polynomial form. It sufﬁces to give algebraic structure to
the ﬁinction C; : S —> [0, 1] (since f;(x) =x+ C;(x)A;, the polynomial
form of C; will automatically give the polynomial form of f;). To do
this, consider the ﬁinction c[a,b](z) :1 if a fz f b and c011,] (1) =0
otherwise (i.e. cub] is the characteristic function of [a,b]). Since
C;(x) = nseotC[W(5,;)ﬁk-V] 06101—156qu W(s,;)_ 110%), we only need 10
give algebraic structure to cub] (the polynomial form of C; will be
given by the product of the polynomial forms of its factors). It is not
difﬁcult to see that the polynomial ﬁinction Za<r<b(1 — (z — r)1’_ 1)
is equal to 1 if a f z 3 b and 0 otherwise. Her—ice_, the polynomial
form of cub] is c[asb](z)= Zairibﬂ — (z— r)p_1). This gives the
polynomial form of C; (x), which, in turn, gives the polynomial form
off;(x) =x+ C;(x)A;, wheref; 21F" —> 1F".
EXAMPLE 4.1. Consider a transition t of a l-bounded Petri net such
that at: {x1,x2} and t: {x3,x4} (with weights equal to 1). Then
C;(x) = C11, 1](x1)c[1, 1](x2)c[010](x3)c[010](x4). Since 6100] (Z) =
1—z and c[1,1](z)=z, itfollows that C;(x)=x1x2(1—x3)(1—x4).
Hence the polynomial form off; is given by f;(x)=x+x1x2(1 —x3)
(1 — X4)At .

Now, we can state and solve algebraically some Petri net
problems. For example, the problem of ﬁnding dead markings
becomes the problem of solving polynomial equations, which can
be easily addressed within the algebraic framework, as was the case
for logical models. More precisely, we have the following remark.
REMARK 4.2. A marking x of a K -bounded Petri net is dead if and
only if x68 and f;(x)=x for all [6 T. Let <p(x)=]_[;':1c[0,ki](x;).
Note that (p(x)= 1 if x68 and (p(x)=0 otherwise. Then the set of
dead markings is given by the solutions of the system of polynomial
equations

f;l(x)=x, ..., f;m(x)=x, (p(x)=1.

REMARK 4.3. If the polynomial form of f; for all transitions t is
known, then we can easily recover A using the equation C;(x)A; =
f;(x) —x and hence ﬁnd the P- and T-invariants.

4.3 Example

Consider the Petri net model in Chaouiya et al. (2008) for the core
lambda switch

S= {C1,Cro}.

T: {0:137 IZ=ICI,{(CI,1),(Cro,1)}’ 13:13:07 t4=tCro,{(Cro,2)}’
’5 =tCro,{(CI,1)}’ ’6 =tCro,{(CI,1),(Cro,2)}}’

F={(t1,CI), (Cro, t1), (CI,t2), (Cro,tz), (t2,Cr0), (t3,Cr0),
(Cro,t4), (t4,Cro), (CI,t5), (Cro,t5), (CI,t6), (Cro,t6), (t6,Cr0)}.
F_ = {(CI,t1),(CI,t3),(Cro,t3),(CI,t4),(Cr0,15)}.

W(e)=2 for e€{(Cro,t4),(Cro,t6)} and W(e)=1 for the other
arcs in F. Also, WT (e)=2 for e6 {(Cro,t3),(Cro,t5)} and W(e)=1
for the other arcs in F_.

It follows that AT is given by

[1 [2 I3 [4 [5 [6
CI 1 —1 0 0 0 0
Cro 0 0 1 —1—1—1

This Petri net is (1,2)-bounded (Chaouiya et al., 2008) and,
therefore, we can use the algebraic framework. Notice that (p(x)=
c[0,1](x1)c[012](x2)=(x1 + 1)2. Let us compute the polynomial form
of f;5. First, notice that c1030](z)=(1—z)(1+z), c[1,1](z)=z(2—
z), 612,2](z)=z(1—z)i 611,2](Z)=z2 and 610,1](z)=(1+z)2. Then.
C;5(x)=c[1,1](x1)c[112](x2)c[0,1](x2) which reduces to C;5(x)=
x1(2—x1)x2(2—x2). Since A;5 =(0, —1), it follows that f;5(x)=
x+x1(2—xi)xz(2—X2)(Oi—1)=(xi;x2 —xi(2—X1)X2(2—x2)). The
polynomial forms for all the transitions are

inC) = (Xi+(1—Xi)(1+xi)(1—x2)(1+x2)ix2).
f2(x) = (xi —xi(2—xi>x§.x2>.
f3(x) = (xi.x2+(1—xi>(1+xi>(1+x2>2>.
f4(x) = (Min-(1 -Xi)(1+Xi)X2(1—X2))i
f5(x) = (xiixz—xiQ—xihza—Xz».
f6(x) = (xlix2—x1(2—x1)x2(1—x2))-
To ﬁnd the dead markings, we have to solve the system
(1—xi)(1+Xi)(1—x2)(1+xz)= 0.
x1(2-xi)x% = 0.
(1—xi>(1+xi>(1+x2)2 = 0.
(1—xi)(1+xi)x2(1—x2) = 0.
x1(2—x1)x2(2—x2) = 0,
x1(2—x1)x2(1—x2) = 0,
(x1+1)2—1 = 0.

The last equation corresponds to the requirement that x e 8. Using
MacaulayZ, we obtain the marking (1,0) as the only dead marking.

5 DISCUSSION

The problem of giving mathematical structure to logical models has
been studied by several authors (e.g. Egri-Nagy and Nehaniv, 2008).
For the purpose of computation and analysis, the structure proposed
here provides a class of simple and easily deﬁned mathematical
objects that can model both logical models and bounded Petri nets.
It has the advantage that it makes accessible the theoretical concepts,
algorithms and software from polynomial algebra, such as Grobner

basis theory, which underlies many of the algorithms for solving
systems of polynomial equations.

It is important to mention that in this article we focus on ﬁnding
steady states and dead markings, not because that is the only
application of our framework, but because it can be translated
directly into the algebraic problem of solving polynomial equations
without much difﬁculty; the framework we propose can be also
used to answer other questions. For instance, theory, algorithms
and software were used in Laubenbacher and Stigler (2004) and
subsequent papers to give a solution to the problem of reverse-
engineering of gene regulatory networks from experimental time
course data. This allows us to ﬁnd all logical models that satisfy
certain properties as done by SMBioNet (http://smbionet.lami.univ-
evry.fr) with the additional advantage of allowing a systematic
study and classiﬁcation of such models. One can also solve the
reverse problem, that is, given a family of models, by using our
framework, we ﬁnd properties that they all satisfy (see Section 3.4).
Furthermore, the theory inherent in the algebraic framework can
give rise to theorems. For example, the algebraic structure was used
to give an exact formula for the structure of the phase space of
linear systems (Elspas, 1959; Hernandez-Toledo, 2005) and lower
and upper bounds for the number of limit cycles of conjunctive
and disjunctive Boolean networks (Jarrah et al., 2010). Also, the
family of nested canalizing functions has been shown to have an
algebraic structure (toric variety) that allows their characterization
(Jarrah et al., 2007). These ﬁinctions appear frequently in Boolean
models of regulatory networks and their dynamics have desirable
properties. Functionality of circuits can also be studied within this
framework (see Supplementary Material).

Polynomial algebra can, therefore, complement the existing
analysis tools for logical models and Petri nets, and we have shown
several examples of its use. It is also worth mentioning that Petri
nets are a special case of bipartite models, consisting of two sets
of nodes, representing ‘places’ and ‘events,’ respectively, connected
by directed edges. More general bipartite models are quite common
in systems biology (e.g. Warren et al., 2009), and they might
be amenable to analysis with similar methods. It is also worth
mentioning that, while the examples used here are all gene regulatory
networks, there are examples of logical/Petri net models of other
kinds of molecular networks (e.g. Simao et al., 2005), so that the
analysis framework described here is more widely applicable.

A potential disadvantage of the algebraic framework is that it is
less intuitive than either logical models or Petri nets. Even in the
Boolean case it is often difﬁcult to give a biological interpretation
to a Boolean function in polynomial form, even if the equivalent
Boolean expression is quite meaningful. However, with appropriate
software, the typical user wanting to analyze a logical model or Petri
net does not need to explicitly manipulate polynomial functions or
even be aware that they are used in the analysis. On the other hand,
some questions or aspects of logical models and Petri nets may
not currently have a direct counterpart in the algebraic framework;
for example, the asynchronous update commonly used in logical
models does not currently have a direct counterpart in the polynomial
algebra framework. This deserves further investigation.

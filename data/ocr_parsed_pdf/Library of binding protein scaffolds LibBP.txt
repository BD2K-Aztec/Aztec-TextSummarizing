Abstract

Motivation: Developments in biotechnology have enabled the in vitro evolution of binding proteins.
The emerging limitations of antibodies in binding protein engineering have led to suggestions for
other proteins as alternative binding protein scaffolds. Most of these proteins were selected based
on human intuition rather than systematic analysis of the available data. To improve this strategy,
we developed a computational framework for finding desirable binding protein scaffolds by utilizing
protein structure and sequence information.

Results: For each protein, its structure and the sequences of evolutionarily—related proteins were ana—
lyzed, and spatially contiguous regions com posed of highly variable residues were identified. A large
number of proteins have these regions, but leucine rich repeats (LRRs), histidine kinase domains and
immunoglobulin domains are predominant among them. The candidates suggested as new binding
protein scaffolds include histidine kinase, LRR, titin and pentapeptide repeat protein.

1 Introduction

The development of recombinant DNA technologies and binding
protein screening methods has enabled researchers to imitate in vivo
adaptive immune processes in the laboratory and thereby engineer—
specific protein binders. This in vitro protein evolution is composed
of two steps: (1) generation of a large span of diversified proteins
and (2) selection of proteins with high affinity to the target mol—
ecules. Various combinations of protein diversification and selection
technologies, such as phage display (Scott and Smith, 1990), yeast
surface display (Boder and Wittrup, 1997) and ribosome display
(Hanes and Pluckthun, 1997), are currently applied to perform
in vitro protein evolution.

Except for the development of peptide epitopes, these technologies
require scaffold proteins where the epitope recognition sites are
randomized. Antibodies are the key component of the adaptive

immune system and have highly variable complementarity—determining
regions; consequently, they have been widely engineered as the scaf—
folds for binding proteins (Hoogenboom, 1998, 2005; Jost and
Pluckthun, 2014; Ossipow and Fischer, 2014). However, the limita—
tions of antibodies as scaffold proteins, such as their high molecular
weight, multi—chain nature and overly large variable regions, have
emerged, and alternative proteins have therefore been sought (Skerra,
2007). To date, more than 40 alternative binding proteins, composed
of a structurally stable region and a variable region where diverse
amino acids can be placed, have been identified (Binz et (11., 2005).
Skerra (2007) specifically described three desirable properties for scaf—
folds in a binding protein library: they must have (1) a compact
and rigid core, (2) a contiguous surface region where the amino acids
can be replaced and (3) exposure of hydrophobic residues in the vari—
able region. For many scaffold proteins, their loop regions are selected

as the variable regions (Binz et (11., 2005; Nuttall and Walsh, 2008),
and structural components are rarely considered during scaffold pro—
tein selection. The exceptions are repeat proteins, in which repetitive
patterns constitute—specific horseshoe shapes and their concave regions
are used as the variable regions (Lee et (11., 2012; Main et (11., 2003;
Stumpp et (11., 2003a, b). However, most binding protein scaffolds
were selected for their native functions, and little attention has been
paid to their diversity and structure. Along with exponential increase in
protein sequence information (Acland et (11., 2014), recent advances in
structural genomics have expanded our understanding of proteins and
their structures (Khafizov et (11., 2014). This information can be utilized
to systemically identify new candidates for binding protein scaffolds.

In this study, we computationally analyzed the structures and se—
quences of proteins to discover scaffolds with desirable properties for
binding protein libraries. First, the sequences of evolutionarily—related
proteins were collected and their amino acid diversity was evaluated
to establish the variable residues. The spatial relationship among the
variable residues was evaluated using the protein structures. A scoring
function, combining the sequence and structure information, was em—
ployed to determine highly variable and contiguous regions.
Consequently, we were able to identify new candidates for binding
protein scaffolds along with previously developed binding proteins. In
addition, we provide a web—based database for the binding protein
scaffolds found in this analysis, as well as a web—based analysis tool
that can be used to detect the variable region of any protein structure.

2 Methods

To be successfully engineered into a scaffold for binding proteins, a
protein should possess a surface—exposed region that can be diversi—
fied without sacrificing structural integrity. In this study, a computa—
tional method was employed to find and evaluate highly diversifiable
and contiguous surface regions. The overall scheme of the method is
illustrated in Figure 1a, with specific details described in the following
sections. In brief, residue variability was extracted from evolutionar—
ily—related proteins (sequence variation analysis) and protein structure
was analyzed to evaluate the external accessibility and internal con—
nectivity among residues (structure analysis). This information was
then combined, and the contiguous regions composed of variable resi—
dues, which are referred to as ‘variable patches’ here, were searched
(i.e. variable patch analysis). Finally, the variable patches were com—
bined into a larger structural unit, termed an ‘extended patch’, to rep—
resent the diversifiable region that can be utilized for further affinity
maturation.

2.1 Structure set

Since we aimed to find the alternatives to immunoglobulin G whose
dimeric structure is one of the weaknesses as a scaffold protein, only
the monomeric protein structures were considered in this study.
In this process, monomer protein structures that were elucidated by
X—ray crystallography and had a resolution <2.0  were analyzed.
Redundant structures were removed during collection from
the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et (11., 2002) by setting a 40%
sequence identity cutoff. As a result, 4818 biological monomer
structures were collected and analyzed. Because protein size is an
important factor for binding proteins, proteins were classified as ei—
ther ‘small’, with <200 residues, or ‘large’, with 2200 residues.

2.2 Sequence variation analysis
To obtain the sequence information of a PDB structure, evolutionar—
ily—related sequences were retrieved from the NCBI non—redundant

database (Sayers et (11., 2012), compiled on December 2014, by
using BLASTP (Camacho et (11., 2009) with an e—value cutoff of
0.001. From the retrieved sequences, the amino acids that were
mapped to the residues in the structure were collected. For each resi—
due, sequence variation was evaluated by calculating the Shannon
entropy (Shannon, 1951) of the amino acid composition using the
following equation:

20
SZZPilﬂPh (1)
i:1

where p,- is the frequency of an amino acid 1'. The residues with en—
tropy >2.0 were defined as variable residues; otherwise, they were
defined as invariable residues. In addition, residues with structural
importance were excluded from variable residues. Some residues
were mainly composed of non—polar amino acids (FILMWY), and
yet exposed to the solvent (Supplementary Fig. S1). These residues
may be critical for stabilizing the hydrophobic cores of the proteins.
Therefore, residues with the non—polar amino acid fraction >5 0%
were designated as hydrophobic residues and they were excluded
from the variable residues. Glycine and proline prefer a distinctive
backbone conformation (H0 and Brasseur, 2005); therefore, resi—
dues comprising >50% glycine or proline were also regarded as
invariable.

2.3 Structure analysis

Surface—exposed residues were identified by evaluating the solvent
accessible surface area (SASA) relative to the fully exposed SASA of
each amino acid (Chothia, 1976). SASA was calculated by using the
AREAIMOL program in CCP4 suite (The CCP4 suite: Programs for
protein crystallography, 1994) with probe radius of 1.4  Residues
with relative SASA >2.5% were defined as surface residues. For
each residue, its accessible region in three—dimensional space was
further evaluated considering the orientation of its side chain.
Specifically, the protein was placed in space divided with three—di—
mensional grid points at 1—A intervals. The grid points within 3 
from atoms of invariable residues or main chain atoms were classi—
fied as inaccessible. Among the remaining grid points, those around
a residue was classified as accessible if that grid point was within 7
A of the 06 carbon of the residue and the angle between the grid, [3
and 06 carbons was >90° (Fig. 1b). The accessible grids were used for
further evaluation of the accessible region of the residue. If the over—
lap between the accessible regions of two residues was larger than
10 A3, the two were considered to form a contiguous surface (Fig.
1c). By combining the amino acid variability from the sequence vari—
ation analysis and the spatial accessibility and residue contiguity in—
formation from the structure analysis, a variable residue network
was constructed. This network was composed of nodes for variable
residues, which contain the amino acid variation information, and
edges for residue—residue connection information, which reﬂect the
spatial overlap of accessible regions (Fig. 1d).

2.4 Variable patch analysis

For the purpose of library construction, the diversity of the available
amino acids is more important than the mere variability score of the
amino acid composition defined by Equation 1. For example, a residue
composed of three amino acids with the compositions 0.8, 0.1 and 0.1
has smaller entropy than a residue with 0.5, 0.5 and 0 compositions
for the same amino acids. However, because the three amino acids can
be placed in the first residue, it should be considered more diversified.
Therefore, the amino acid frequency was converted into a Boolean
amino acid presence vector, and the number of available amino acids

Fig. 1. Methods: the sequence variation and structural features of the proteins were analyzed and the variable patch regions were found. (a) The entire analysis is
a collection of four analyses (each detailed in the ‘Methods' section): (1) sequence variation analysis, (2) surface analysis, (3) surface patch analysis and (4) ex-
tended patch analysis. (b) The accessible region was defined by the distance and angle conditions, which were defined by the coordinates of or and ﬂ carbons.
During evaluation, the regions occupied by the atoms of the invariable residues were excluded from the accessible region. (0) When the overlapping accessible
region of two residues was larger than 10 A3, connections were established, with the overlapping volume representing the strength of the connection. (d)
Consequently, a network comprised of variable residues and their connections was constructed. Then, the sub-networks with high variability (red nodes) and
strong connection (darker edges) were sought with the patch finding algorithm (see ‘Methods' section). (e) A network of variable patches was constructed and a
community search algorithm was employed to determine the extended patches. Within each extended patch, the patch with the highest patch score was desig-
nated as the core (C) and the others as the rims (R). In this illustration, the patches with high patch score were colored in red

was used as a measure of the residue diversity. The amino acids
observed significantly less often than expected were presumed to be
absent at the residue, and the following equation was applied for the
conversion:

where BL,- is the Boolean presence variable, f6,- is the observed fre—
quency of amino acid 1' at residue r and  is the frequency of amino
acid 1' in the surface. The number of available amino acids for resi—
due r (N,) was calculated as the summation of the presence
variables.

2.5 Variable patch score

A variable patch was defined as a set of interconnected variable resi—
dues. A large combination of the variable patches can be extracted
from the variable residue network, but only those with desirable
properties should be selected. The desirable properties were modeled
with a variable patch score for which two factors were considered:
(1) the chemical diversity and (2) the spatial accessibility and con—
tiguity. As the interaction environment is provided by more than
one residue in protein—mediated interaction (Reichmann et (11.,
2005), the environment formed by two adjacent residues was eval—
uated. Thus, the chemical diversity was modeled as the product of
the number of available amino acids in two adjacent residues. The
spatial accessibility and contiguity was evaluated as the overlapping
volume of the accessible regions of the two residues. Finally, the
product of the two values was used as the variable patch score,

51/: E Z VijNiN/"a (3)
i:1 i:i+1

where 5,, represents the variable patch score for a variable patch
with 71 residues, and V,-,- is the overlapping volume of the accessible
region between two residues. A large overlapping volume can limit
spatial accessibility and therefore the effect of the overlapping vol—
ume would not be linear. In order to consider this effect, step func—
tions and saturating linear functions with different parameters were
tested. These tests produced similar results (Supplementary Fig. S3):
thus, the simple linear equation was used here.

2.6 Variable patch search algorithm

In the variable residue network, sets of variable residues with high
variable patch scores were sought (Fig. 1d). First, all possible mutu—
ally connected nodes of three were identified and used as an initial
patch. Next, an adjacent node that produced the largest increase in
variable patch score was determined and incorporated into the ori—
ginal patch to form a new patch. This patch extension process was
repeated until further expansion was not possible or the number of
residues in the patch reached seven. Consequently, multiple patches
with corresponding variable patch scores were generated for each
protein structure. In this study, the expansion of the patch was
stopped at seven residues, because full randomization of these seven
residues would result in N109 variations, which is the size limit of li—
brary in a typical experimental condition. Note, however, that the
number of residues to randomize can be increased by using the ex—
tended patches described below.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Amino acid diversity in the variable residues

The variability of residues was highly dependent on their location in
protein structure; surface exposed residues were highly variable,
whereas buried residues were less variable (Fig. 2a). Variable resi—
dues, i.e. those with amino acid composition entropy >2.0, com—
prised ~30% of the surface residues. Because the diversity of the
amino acids at a site is more important than the frequency, the
amino acid frequency was converted into an amino acid presence
vector. Compared with the amino acid composition on the surface
region, the composition of the amino acid presence vector was rela—
tively uniform, and all amino acids were well observed in the vari—
able residues (Fig. 2b). In addition, the number of amino acid types
observed on each variable residue tended to be large (Fig. 2c). These
results suggest that our variable residue criteria have successfully de—
tected the residues that can accommodate a variety of amino acids.

3.2 Accessibility of the variable residues

In addition to having high variability, residues should be spatially
accessible to the binding partners. The spatial accessibility of the
residues was determined from the structure of the protein and the
accessible region around the residues. Interestingly, the variable resi—
dues on the surface were more accessible than the other invariable
surface residues (Fig. 2d). This may be because the highly accessible
residue is under less structural constraint and can accommodate dif—
ferent types of amino acids. Therefore, the variable residues can be
utilized as the diversification sites for a binding protein library.

3.3 Connectivity to other variable residues

The physicochemical environment generated by a single residue is
limited, but when several residues are located close to each other,
they can produce a complex interaction environment. Hence, vari—
able residues connected with a larger number of other variable resi—
dues are considered more desirable for construction of a binding
protein library. Among the variable residues, ~24% were isolated,
and the number of residues decreased as connectivity increased (Fig.
2e). About 60% of variable residues were connected with 22 vari—
able residues and these could provide diverse spatially contiguous
surfaces. Among all of these possible contiguous surfaces, those with
high variability and accessibility were selected using the patch score.

were compared with those of the other residues. (a) Residues on protein sur-

In addition, the distribution of the amino acid presence vector showed
increased uniformity compared to the amino acid composition. All amino
acids except tryptophan had been found in more than half of the variable resi-
dues, and the amino acids E, K, N, 0, R, S, T and V were found >80% of the
variable residues. (0) A large number of different amino acids were observed
at the variable residues, compared with the residues in the protein surface.
(d) Among surface residues, the variable residues were more accessible from
outside of the protein than the invariable residues. (e) The variable residues
were generally well connected to other variable residues. The plots in (a), (c)
and (d) are normalized histograms for each group

3.4 Variable patches

The residue variation, spatial accessibility and connectivity to other
residues were collectively evaluated by using the ‘variable patch
score,’ and high scoring variable patches were established for each
protein. Consequently, protein scaffolds with exceptionally variable
surface regions were identified (Fig. 3a). The top 25 small and large
proteins with the highest patch scores are listed in Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2, respectively (complete information is accessible
via our web server).

3.5 Extended variable patches

The surface of a protein can accommodate more than one highly
variable patch, and the size of the variable patch can be larger than
seven residues. Such structures were defined here as ‘extended vari—
able patches.’ In proteins with highly variable patches, the extended
patch regions were successfully found. In addition, the highly vari—
able ‘core’ patch was topologically located on the center of the ex—
tended variable patch surrounded by ‘rim’ patches. The extended
patches for five protein structures are illustrated in Figure 3b—f.

Fig. 3. Variable patches. (a) Variable patches were analyzed among thousands of monomer protein structures, and proteins with highly variable surfaces were
identified. Among proteins with high patch scores, the extended patches were also established. Consequently, five proteins were selected as scaffolds for binding
proteins: (b) histidine kinase (PDB 3AOY); (c) histidine kinase (PDB AGTS); (d) LRR domain in NALP1 (PDB 4|M6); (e) immunoglobulin domains in titin (PDB 2A38)
and (f) pentapeptide repeats (PDB 2J8K). The core variable regions of extended patch 1, 2 and 3 are displayed as red, blue, and green surfaces and rim variable re-
gions of extended patch 1, 2, and 3 are displayed as orange, pale blue and yellow surfaces. The protein structures are shown in gray. PyMol (Schrédinger, 2010)

was used to produce these illustrations

3.6 Proteins with high patch scores

High scoring patches were predominantly found in three protein
structures; the leucine rich repeat (LRR) fold, histidine kinase do—
main and immunoglobulin domain (Supplementary Tables S1 and
S2). The LRR is a structure composed of repeats of short structures
and is known to mediate protein—protein interactions (PPIs) (Kobe
and Kajava, 2001). Because of their biological role in PPIs and
unique modular structure, LRRs have been engineered as protein
binder molecules (Lee et 41]., 2012; Stumpp et 41]., 2003a). In our
analysis, LRR—based protein binder molecules had high patch scores
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The variable regions were
located on the concave region of the protein (Fig. 3d); these regions
were also used in a previous binder design (Lee et 41]., 2012; Stumpp
et 41]., 2003a). Histidine kinase is a kinase domain of signal—trans—
duction enzymes, which are widely used in bacteria and eukaryotes
from outside the animal kingdom (Wolanin et 41]., 2002). The pro—
teins are composed of three ot—helixes and five [f—strands, and the
variable sites are located on the [f—sheet region (Fig. 3b and c). The
immunoglobulin fold is a protein domain composed of a 2—layer
sandwich of [f—sheets, which is found in proteins with a diverse range
of biological functions (Bork et 41]., 1994). Proteins with immuno—
globulin domains were widely used in the binding protein library
and many immunoglobulin domains were retrieved with high patch
scores. Unlike the previous research, where the loop region was
randomized, the variable contiguous patch region found in this
study is located on the [f—sheet region of the protein (Fig. 3e).

3.7 Selection of binding protein scaffolds

The variable patches were analyzed for 4818 monomer proteins,
among which five proteins were selected as examples for new binding
protein scaffolds to illustrate the utility of the analysis (Table 1). In

addition to the variable patch scores, other features, such as size,
source, expression host and solubility, were considered. The first two
structures were histidine kinase domains. The first binding protein
scaffold (BP1) was derived from a histidine kinase domain originating
from a hyperthermophilic organism. This protein was selected because
it is functional at high temperatures and its thermal stability is ex—
pected to be high. To construct BP2, a histidine kinase predicted to be
soluble in the ESPRESSO server (Hirose and Noguchi, 2013) was
used.

LRR domains tended to have high patch scores. The LRR do—
main in NALP1 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains—containing pro—
tein 1) was used to construct the third library, BP3. NACHT—LRR
protein is a human—originated protein involved in the recognition of
bacteria, and the LRR domain contributes toward recognition of the
interaction partner (Kufer et 41]., 2005). This property indicates that
the domain may be a good binder.

Immunoglobulin domains were predicted as desirable scaffolds
for binding proteins, with the [f—sheet region of the immunoglobulin
selected as a good library generation site. BP4 was constructed from
domains in titin, a long elastic filament in muscle composed of a
number of immunoglobulin and fibronectin domains (Labeit and
Kolmerer, 1995). The fibronectin type III domain (FN3) has been
used as a binding scaffold (Koide et 41]., 2012) where the [f—sheet re—
gion has been randomized as the binding interface. The structure of
titin found in this study was slightly different from that of FN3 and
the [f—sheet on the opposite side was selected in this study. Titin ori—
ginates from humans and may be less prone to cause immunogen—
icity problems when used as biopharmaceuticals. In addition, the
domain used in library construction lacked disulfide bonds, which is
a desirable property for expression in Escherichia 6011'. In addition,
two immunoglobulin domains are linked with a short peptide. This

tandem repeat architecture could allow the design of proteins for
multiple targets or proteins with multiple binding sites for a single
target.

BP5 was derived from the pentapeptide—repeat structures.
Pentapeptide—repeat proteins are composed of repeated amino acid
sequences, and they are widely found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes
(Vetting et 41]., 2006). This protein possessed three highly variable
patches that faced different regions of the protein (Fig. 3f). This
unique structure could be exploited to develop a binding protein
with three distinctive interaction interfaces (Table 1).

The sequences of the five proteins, including variable residue
positions, are listed in Supplementary Table S3. Except for BP1, the
variable residues that belonged to the highest scoring patch were
suggested as the diversification sites. In BP1, the residues in the se—
cond highest scoring patch were selected as diversification sites be—
cause they were closely located in the sequence, which allows easier
construction of the DNA library. In BP1, BP2 and BP4, the span for
the randomization sites was short with 12, 16 and 12 amino acids,
respectively. Thus, for construction of the DNA library, the random—
ization portion can be synthesized as a whole and inserted into the
scaffold in a single step. Due to the repeat architecture, the random—
ization sites in BP3 and BP5 were separated in sequence space and
their spans were 32 and 42 amino acids, respectively. Therefore, a
more elaborate library generation scheme might be required.

3.8 Structural variation of core regions

A good scaffold protein possesses a stable core region. Here, the struc—
tural stability of the selected proteins was indirectly evaluated based on
the structural similarity of evolutionarily—related proteins. For each se—
lected protein, the structures of proteins with high—sequence similarity
were retrieved from the PDB using an e—value cutoff of 0.001 (Berman
et 41]., 2002). These structures were structurally aligned by using TM—
align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) and visualized with PyMol
(Schrodinger, 2010). The structures of proteins related to the five pro—
teins of interest were highly similar (Fig. 4), which suggests that the se—
lected proteins possess stable core regions and, therefore, could be
utilized as scaffolds for binding protein. This was also supported by
their sequence profiles (Supplementary Fig. S4). The buried residues
constituting the hydrophobic core were well preserved throughout evo—
lutionarily—related sequences and were composed of hydrophobic
amino acids. The sequence profile illustrated in Supplementary Figure
S4 was drawn by using WebLogo ( Crooks et al.,2004).

3.9 Comparison with previously suggested binding
protein scaffolds

Variable patch analysis was also applied to 34 proteins that are al—
ready used as binding protein scaffolds. Variable patches with moder—
ately high scores were found in transferrin, TPR protein and
lipocalins (Supplementary Table S4). However, in general, variable
patch scores were low and initial variable patches, i.e. three

results suggest that the previously—developed binding protein scaffolds
examined here were generally derived from well-conserved proteins
and that the randomization sites were selected relying on intuition
(mainly under the assumption that the loop would be varied). Hence,
the new protein scaffolds identified computationally in this research
cover different proteins and could therefore expand the existing set of
binding protein scaffolds.

4 Conclusion

In this study, we developed a computational method that utilized resi—
due variability and connectivity to evaluate proteins as scaffolds for
binding proteins. LRR folds, histidine kinase domains and immuno—
globulin domains were found to possess desirable variable patches.
The LRR fold and immunoglobulin domain have previously been re—
ported as good scaffolds for binding proteins. The high rank of these
structures in our study suggests that our method identified structures
that could be used as binding protein scaffolds. Considering our results
and several other relevant features of the proteins, we selected five
new binding protein scaffolds. These five proteins can be used to con—
struct binding protein libraries, and we expect that the systematic
evaluation of protein structure, as conducted here, will facilitate the
development of additional new binding protein libraries.

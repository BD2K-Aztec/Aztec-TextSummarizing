Abstract

Summary: Omokage search is a service to search the global shape similarity of biological
macromolecules and their assemblies, in both the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and Electron
Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB). The server compares global shapes of assemblies independent of
sequence order and number of subunits. As a search query, the user inputs a structure ID (PDB ID
or EMDB ID) or uploads an atomic model or 3D density map to the server. The search is performed
usually within 1min, using one—dimensional profiles (incremental distance rank profiles) to
characterize the shapes. Using the gmfit(Gaussian mixture model fitting) program, the found struc—
tures are fitted onto the query structure and their superimposed structures are displayed on the
Web browser. Our service provides new structural perspectives to life science researchers.

Availability and implementation: Omokage search is freely accessible at http://pdbj.org/omokage/.

1 Introduction

Electron microscopy of cellular macromolecules provides 3D density
maps of many important molecular machines. More than 3000 dens—
ity maps are now stored in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank
(EMDB) (Lawson et (11., 2010). Atomic models, obtained by X—ray
crystallography and the current hybrid method, are also available in
the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et (11., 2007). We have been
providing Web—based services, EM Navigator and Yorodumi, for
both databanks (Kinjo et (11., 2012). Shape comparisons among these
3D density maps and atomic models facilitate the elucidation of struc—
tural differences and conformational changes, and the generation of
atomic models from the density maps. However, very few Web ser—
vices look for shapes represented as 3D density maps that are similar
to the atomic models. The Web server EM-SURFER (Esquivel—
Rodriguez et (11., 2015) was recently developed for searching 3D dens—
ity maps. However, it only handles 3D density maps in the EMDB,
and not in the PDB, and does not provide 3D superimpositions.

Here, we describe our new search service, Omokage search,
based on the global shape similarity of the structure data, for both
the PDB and EMDB. Our server provides superimposed structures,
using the program gmfit. Users can visually assess the similarities by
the 3D superimpositions.

2 Methods

2.1 Similarity search

For a fast search through the large dataset, a comparison is per—
formed using one—dimensional (1D) profiles generated from 3D
point models. We employ the vector quantization method to convert
both density maps and atomic models into 3D point models, and use
the Sims software for the conversion (Wriggers et (11., 1998). Four
1D profiles are generated from the 3D point model. Three of them
are generated based on the distances of the 3D point pairs (incre—
mental distance rank profiles). The other is based on the principal

components analysis (PCA) of the 3D point model. Details of the
procedure are described in the Supplementary Data.

2.2 3D superimposition of assemblies

A superimposition of assemblies is performed using the gmfit pro—
gram (Kawabata, 2008), which employs the Gaussian mixture
model (GMM) algorithm to represent both the 3D density maps and
atomic models. The GMM representation considerably reduces the
computational cost for superimposition. We calculate the ‘one—to—
one’ fitting, Where a single density map or an atomic model is
superimposed onto another fixed density map or atomic model. We
employ the principal component axes alignment to generate the
initial configurations, and the steepest descent method to refine the
initial configurations. The computation time for the one—to—one
superimposition is less than one second. Details of the procedure are
described in the Supplementary Data.

3 Server description
3.1 Dataset

In this service, density maps from the EMDB, the asymmetric unit
(AU) and a biological unit (BU) from the PDB are stored in the data—
set. Approximately 2800 EMDB map data, 100 000 PDB AU models
and 100 000 PDB BU models are presently available, and they are
updated weekly.

3.2 Input

Input query structure data can be submitted by specifying the ID of
the data in the search dataset or by uploading one’s own data file.
As trials, some sample query data are shown. For a PDB entry, the
user can specify an assembly ID by adding a number to the four
component PDB ID (e.g. ‘1oel—1’) or by selecting one from the AU
or BU images. PDB format files are acceptable for uploading an
atomic model or a dummy atom model by small angle scattering.
CCP4/MRC format files are acceptable for uploading a 3D density
map, and the surface level should be specified.

3.3 Output

The search usually finishes within 1 min, and a list of similar shaped
structure data (at most, 2000) to the input query data is shown, in
the order of the similarities (Fig. 1, left). The users can open the
page with the interactive viewer, ]mol/]Smol, which will show the
found model superimposed onto the query model by the program
gmfit (Kawabata, 2008; Fig. 1, right).

3.4 Evaluation

We evaluated the performance to detect biological similarities for
both Omokage and EM-SURFER, and concluded that our
Omokage is more powerful to detect biological similarities among
various density maps with different resolutions and volumes.
Details about the performance comparison using the ClpP—ClpB
and 70S—ribosome datasets are described in the Supplementary
Data.

4 Case studies and outlook

We emphasize that the advantage of our server is its ability to rap—
idly compare global shapes independent of sequence—order, subunit
number and type of structural data (atomic model and density map).
We introduce three types of case studies. The first is a search for low
resolution structures. For the query of the 3D map data of RNA
polymerase II (EMDB 2190; 25  resolution), 100 RNA polymerase
structures were found in both databanks, independent of their reso—
lutions. The second is a search for similar assembly forms with dif—
ferent subunits. A search with the PCNA clamp in the trimer ring
form (AU of PDB 3IFV) yielded 100 clamps, including dimer beta
clamps. The third is finding unexpected similar shapes, and implying
some functional similarity (‘molecular mimicry’). The shape similar—
ity of the tRNA—EF—Tu complex (RNA and protein) and EF—G (sin—
gle protein) is a famous example (Nissen et 41]., 1995). The search
using the tRNA—EF—Tu complex structure (AU of PDB 1OB2)
yielded some EF—G structures. The current case studies and the per—
formance are described in detail in the Supplementary Data. Our
server is not meant for sequence—order comparisons of atomic mod—
els of single protein chains, which can be easily performed by
BLAST and DALI. The detection of local substructure similarity has
not been incorporated in the current algorithm. For the hybrid and
integrative methods (Sali et 41]., 2015), such an algorithm should be
developed in the future.

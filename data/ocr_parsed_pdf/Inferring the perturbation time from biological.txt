Abstract

Motivation: Time course data are often used to study the changes to a biological process after
perturbation. Statistical methods have been developed to determine whether such a perturbation
induces changes over time, e.g. comparing a perturbed and unperturbed time course dataset to
uncover differences. However, existing methods do not provide a principled statistical approach to
identify the specific time when the two time course datasets first begin to diverge after a perturb—
ation; we call this the perturbation time. Estimation of the perturbation time for different variables
in a biological process allows us to identify the sequence of events following a perturbation and
therefore provides valuable insights into likely causal relationships.

Results: We propose a Bayesian method to infer the perturbation time given time course data from
a wild—type and perturbed system. We use a non—parametric approach based on Gaussian Process
regression. We derive a probabilistic model of noise—corrupted and replicated time course data
coming from the same profile before the perturbation time and diverging after the perturbation
time. The likelihood function can be worked out exactly for this model and the posterior distribution
of the perturbation time is obtained by a simple histogram approach, without recourse to complex
approximate inference algorithms. We validate the method on simulated data and apply it to study
the transcriptional change occurring in Arabidopsis following inoculation with Pseudomonas syrin-
gae pv. tomato DC3000 versus the disarmed strain DC3000hrpA.

Availability and Implementation: An R package, DEtime, implementing the method is available at
https://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/DEtime along with the data and code required to repro—
duce all the results.

1 Introduction

Gene expression time profiles can reveal important information
about cellular function and gene regulation (see, e.g. Bar—Joseph,
2004). A common experimental design is to perturb a biological
system either before or during a time course experiment. In this
case, a fundamental problem is to identify the precise perturbation
time when a gene’s time profile is first altered. In this paper we

present an exactly tractable Bayesian inference procedure to infer
the perturbation time by comparing perturbed and wild—type gene
expression profiles. Ordering genes by their perturbation time
gives valuable insight into the likely causal sequence of events fol—
lowing a perturbation. We demonstrate the applicability of our
method by studying the timing of transcriptional changes in
Arabidopsis thaliana leaves following inoculation with the

Most methods for the analysis of differentially expressed genes
are based upon snapshots of gene expression (Dudoit et (11., 2002;
Kerr et (11., 2000) and there are many well—established software
packages for that purpose targeted at microarray and RNA—Seq data
(Anders and Huber, 2010; Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010; Robinson
et (11., 2010). However, most of these methods cannot easily be ex—
tended to time course gene expression data and ignoring the tem—
poral nature of the data is statistically inefficient. Methods have
therefore been developed specifically for time—series applications. In
the case of gene expression profiles under a single condition, one—
sample methods have been developed to discriminate differentially
expressed genes from constitutively expressed genes. For example,
probabilistic models have been designed for this purpose which use
a likelihood—ratio test to rank genes based on a comparison between
a dynamic and a constant profile (Angelini et (11., 2008; Kalaitzis
and Lawrence, 2011).

When expression profiles are available from two or more condi—
tions then a two—sample test is more appropriate (Conesa et (11.,
2006; Kim et (11., 2013; Stegle et (11., 2010; Storey et (11., 2005).
Storey et al. (2005) apply a polynomial regression model to simulate
the temporal behaviour of genes and a statistical test to identify dif—
ferentially expressed genes. Conesa et al. (2006) adopt a two—step re—
gression model in analyzing temporal profiles of genes with time
treated as an extra experimental factor. Kim et al. (2013) apply
Fourier analysis to time course gene expression data and identify dif—
ferentially expressed genes in the Fourier domain. Stegle et al.
(2010) apply a model based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression
which is closely related to our proposed approach. In this model,
when two time series are the same they are represented by a shared
GP function but where they differ they are better represented by two
independent GP functions. Binary latent variables are used to model
whether a particular time interval is better represented by two inde—
pendent GPs or one combined GP. More recently, the GP regression
framework has been refined through use of a non—stationary covari—
ance function and a simplified scoring approach to detect time peri—
ods of differential gene expression (Heinonen et (11., 2014). Similar
to the work of Stegle et al. (2010), a log—likelihood ratio is used to
identify time periods of differential expression. In order to better
adapt to the case where unevenly or sparsely distributed times are
used, they introduce a non—stationary covariance function and pro—
posed two novel likelihood ratio tests to evaluate the likelihood at
arbitrary time points. All these approaches can be used to find differ—
entially expressed genes and some can be used to identify temporal
domains where there is support for profiles being different.
However, these methods do not directly score the probability of the
perturbation time where two profiles first diverge, which is the aim
of our approach. Although the methods of Stegle et al. (2010) and
Heinonen et al. (2014) can be adapted to provide an estimate of the
perturbation time, e.g. by applying a thresholding procedure to their
differential expression scores, we show here that direct inference of
the perturbation time is a more powerful approach when that is the
object of interest.

In this paper, we propose a method to identify the perturbation
point given data from two time course experiments. We use a non—
parametric GP to describe the joint posterior distribution of two
time profiles which are equal up to a proposed perturbation time.
The perturbation time is then a model parameter which can be
inferred. We derive the covariance function of the GP model and
show that the likelihood function is exactly tractable. The posterior
distribution of the perturbation time can be computed through a

simple one—dimensional histogram approach, with no assumptions
over the shape of the posterior distribution and no need to resort to
complex approximate inference schemes. This differs from Stegle
et al. (2010) and Heinonen et al. (2014) in that we focus specifically
on inferring the perturbation time and derive an exact approach to
this problem. Stegle et al. (2010) creates a mixed model in pre—
specified time intervals with the transition between independent GPs
and shared GPs. The likelihood in that case must be approximated
using Expectation Propagation (EP) due to its non—Gaussian nature.
Heinonen et al. (2014) provide a simpler approach by adopting the
expected marginal log—likelihood ratio or the noisy posterior con—
centration ratio to construct a smooth curve indicating time periods
of differential expression. However, their approach does not allow
direct inference of the perturbation time.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present back—
ground on GP regression and derive the covariance function, likeli—
hood function and posterior inference procedure for our new model.
In Section 3, the algorithm is demonstrated on simulated data and
subsequently applied to identify the perturbation times for
Arabidopsis genes in a microarray time series dataset detailing the
transcriptional changes that occur in Arabidopsis following inocula—
tion with DC3000 versus the disarmed strain DC3000/7117A (Lewis
et (11., 2015) and with a brief conclusion presented in Section 4.

2 Methods

2.1 Gaussian process regression

Gaussian Processes (GPs) (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006) extend
multivariate Gaussian distributions to infinite dimensionality and
can be used as probabilistic models that specify a distribution over
functions (Lawrence, 2005). GPs have been used in a range of gene
expression applications, e.g. to model the dynamics of transcrip—
tional regulation (Gao et (11., 2008; Honkela et (11., 2010) and in tem—
poral differential expression scoring (Heinonen et (11., 2014;
Kalaitzis and Lawrence, 201 1; Stegle et (11., 2010; Yuan, 2006).

We have a dataset D with N inputs X :{x,,}nl\1:1 and corres—
ponding real valued targets Y : {yn}nN:1. In the case of time course
data the data are ordered such that x” Z xn_1 but there is no restric—
tion on the spacing since GPs operate over a continuous domain. We
allow the case x” : xn_1 since that provides a simple way to incorp—
orate replicates. We assume that measurement noise in Y, denoted
by e, is i.i.d Gaussian distributed 6 ~ N(0, (721) and the underlying
model for Y as a function of X is so that

Y=f(X)+e.

and f (X) represents the mean of the data generating process. Our
prior modelling assumption is that the function f is drawn from a
GP prior with mean function u(X), covariance function K (X, X) and
hyperparameters 0. We write,

f(X) ~ 9730100, K(X7X))r
and the likelihood of Y becomes
14er 0) ~ N(u(X).K(X.X) + all).

where K(X,X) is the N X N covariance matrix with elements
K(x,,,xm). The covariance function describes typical properties of
the function f, e.g. whether it is rough or smooth, stationary or non—
stationary etc. We choose the squared exponential function,

with hyper—parameters 0 : (or, I) specifying the amplitude and length—
scale of samples drawn from the prior. This choice corresponds to a
prior assumption of smooth and stationary functions. However, our
model can be applied with any other choice of covariance function,
e.g. the non—stationary covariance introduced by Heinonen et al.
(2014). The hyper—parameters can be estimated from the data by max—
imum likelihood or through a Bayesian procedure (Rasmussen and
Williams, 2006). We can also consider the noise variance, (72, as an
additional hyper—parameter to be estimated similarly.

A typical regression analysis will be focused on a new input xi.
and its prediction f... Based upon Gaussian properties (Rasmussen
and Williams, 2006) the posterior distribution of f, given data Y is

,r, : K(X,x.)I(K(x,X) + (721)—1Y,

c. : K(x.,x.) — K(x,x.)I(K(x,x) + a21)—1K(x,x.).

We see then that the posterior distribution is also a GP but it is
adapted to the data. The mean prediction is a weighted sum over
data with weights larger for nearby points in a manner determined
by the covariance function. The posterior covariance captures our
uncertainty in the inference of f >r< and will typically be reduced as we
incorporate more data.

A special case of GP regression, which is useful in deriving our
model below, is the case where (X,Y) is a single point (xpm) meas—
ured with zero noise. In this case the GP regression of all new points
X given (xp, 14) is then

2.2 Joint distribution of two functions constrained to
cross at one point

Consider the case where two time profiles, f (X) and g(Z), evaluated
at specified sets of time points X and Z, respectively, cross at the
point xp with f (xp) : g(xp) : u at the crossing point. Before con—
sidering the constraint we use the same GP prior for each function
with hyperparameters 0,

f(X) ~ 9P(M(X)7K(X7X))r g(Z) ~ 9P(M(Z)7K(Zrz))-

Imposing the constraint that the functions cross at xp is equiva—
lent to observing a data point (xp, 14) with zero noise. Then p(f)X, u)
and p(g)Z, u) are as in Eq. (2),

P(f(X))M) ~ N01» CX)7 P(g(Z))M) ~ N012, Cz).

K(Z,xp)u I<(z,x,,)1<(z,x,,)T
: —, C : K 2, z — —
MZ K(xp,xp) Z ( ) K(xp,xp)

In practice, the time profiles f (X) and g(Z) are typically meas—
ured at the same time points, so that Z can be replaced by X. The

value of the functions at the crossing point, 14, is not known and we
marginalize it out using the prior Gaussian distribution
14 ~ N(0,K(xp,xp)). The joint probably distribution of f and g is
then given by Eq. (5 ) below,

p<f<x>.g<x>> : JWIX u>p<grx u>p<u>dm

cxexp(—§<f g>2-1<f gf).

so that the two functions are jointly Gaussian distributed as N(0, 2)
with covariance given by,

where Kx, [exp and lax are abbreviations for K(X,X), K(xp,xp) and
K (X, xp), respectively. We show an example of this covariance func—
tion in Figure 1 (upper panel) for X in the range [0,100] and
xp : 40. The detailed derivations of Eqs. (5) and (6) are illustrated in
the Supplementary.

2.3 The data likelihood under the model
We define the perturbation time xp as the point where two time pro—
files first begin to diverge. If the time profiles are measured without
noise then it would be trivial to identify this point. However, biolo—
gical time course data from high—throughput experiments are often
corrupted by significant biological and technical sources of noise
and our task is to infer the perturbation time given noisy time course
data. In order to do that we must first derive the likelihood function
under the new model.

Let two sets of gene expression time course data, y‘ (X) and
31” (X), represent noisy measurements with i.i.d Gaussian measure—
ment noise, N(0, (721), from the control condition and perturbed
condition, respectively. A GP prior is placed on the mean functions

The lower panel in Figure 1 shows the data covariance matrix X

2.4 Posterior distribution of the perturbation point
According to Bayes’ rule the posterior distribution of xp is,

p(xp‘yc(X)7yP(X)): p(yC(X)ryp(X)ixp)p(xp) .
1120600,yv<x>rxp>p<xp>dxp

We assume a uniform prior on xp within the range [xmimxmax] of
the observed data. We use a simple discretization x1, 6 [xmimxmin
+5,xmrn +25,...,xmax] in this range. Then the posterior can be
approximated as a simple summation over this grid,

C
p<xpryc<xryp<x>> z 
Z P(y‘(X)ayp(X)lx)

x:xmin

only requiring that we evaluate the likelihood at each grid point.
There are hyper—parameters 0 also involved in the posterior distribu—
tion of xp which would potentially complicate matters. We choose
to estimate these hyper—parameters prior to inferring xp. To do this
we use maximum likelihood optimization for the case where xp
approaches —00 which corresponds to the two GPs for the control
and perturbed conditions being independent,

0 : argmax ( lim 179 (y‘ (X), )1" (X))xp, 0)).
0 xP—r—oo
Since we have a simple histogram representation for the poster—
ior distribution of the perturbation time point xp then we can easily
estimate the mean, median or mode (MAP) of the posterior distribu—
tion to provide a point estimate.

2.5 Pre—filtering to remove non—DE genes

In many applications a large number of genes will show no strong
evidence for DE at any time or will have a low signal—to—noise due to
being weakly expressed. We therefore filter genes prior to using our
model. A DE gene will be better represented by two independent
GPs rather than a shared GP under control and perturbed condi—
tions. We therefore filter genes using the log—likelihood ratio r be—
tween the independent GP model (equivalent to xp approaching —00
in the perturbation model) and the integrated GP (with xp approach—
ing +00):

7 =10g£(yc(X)ryp(X)lxp —> -00) -10g£(yc(X)ryp(X)lxp —* +00)

We note that it is difficult to distinguish genes with a late per—
turbation time from those that are non—DE and our filtering ap—
proach may remove some genuine late perturbation genes. In many
applications we are primarily interested on relatively early perturb—
ations (e.g. in the application considered here) in which case this
will not significantly impact the results. In the Supplementary we
consider an alternative filtering approach which is based on detect—
ing genes with time—varying profile in either the control or perturbed
condition and is therefore less likely to filter out late xp genes.

The method has been implemented in the DEtime R—package
(github.com/ManchesterBioinference/DEtime) and also as the
DEtime kernel in the GPy Python package (github.com/
SheffieldML/GPy). The running time for the whole genome (32 578
genes) for the example in Section 3.3 on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7—
3770 CPU of 3.40 GHz is around 11 h using the DEtime R—package.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Generating simulated data

We generated data under a range of different scenarios to explore
performance and robustness to deviations from the model. We gen—
erated expression profiles from three different covariance models,
one matching the one used for inference and the other two generat—
ing rougher profiles. We then add noise using three different noise
models, one matching the Gaussian model used for inference and
two from heavier—tailed distributions.

Nine simulated dataset are induced with different kinds of i.i.d
noise on top of profile1, profile; and profileg, respectively: Gaussian
N(1.5), Student—t distributed with 3 (T(3)) and 6 (T(6)) degrees of
freedom. The simulated data are sampled every hour from 0 h until
1 8 h. We simulate data with a range of perturbation times xp 6 {0, 1
, . . . , 17, 18} and 100 different sets of data are produced for each xp
value.

Figure 2(a) shows an example of simulated data (using the pro-
file1+N (1.5) scenario) with two replicates and a perturbation at
4 h. The estimated posterior distribution of xp is shown in the upper
panel and in the lower panel we show the GP regression function
after fixing xp at the MAP value. In this case the MAP estimate for
xp is very close to the ground truth. The mean, mode and median of
the posterior distribution of xp for 19 simulated datasets are illus—
trated in Figure 2(b) together with the 5—95 percentile coverage of
the posterior distribution. It is clear that the posterior distributions
of the perturbation time cover the actual perturbation time to a
great extent and that the three different point estimates are typically
close to the ground truth values.

3.2 Comparison with a thresholding approach

Related methods have been introduced to identify regions of differ—
ential expression from time course data (Heinonen et (11., 2014;
Stegle et (11., 2010). Such methods can in principle also be used to
identify the perturbation time by locating the first time point where
the DE score passes some threshold value. Here we compare our
approach to the most recently published package of this type, devel—
oped by Heinonen et al. (2014) implemented in the nsgp R—package.
The nsgp package infers the differentially expressed time periods
and uses four likelihood ratios: marginal log—likelihood ratio (MLL),
expected marginal log—likelihood ratio (EMLL), the posterior con—
centration (PC) and the noisy posterior concentration (NPC) to
quantify these regions. We adopt thresholds of 0.5 and 1.0 to define
the initial perturbation points, respectively. The mean, median and
mode of the posterior distribution of the inferred perturbation

points from our method are also computed. The performance of
ranking xp using each method is measured by Spearman’s rank cor—
relation coefficient with the known ground truth and the mean and
standard deviation of the rank correlation coefficients across 100
dataset are illustrated in Table 1.

From the table, it is clear that the mean, median and MAP esti—
mates from the DEtime package provide better ranking perform—
ance. The results from the nsgp package vary significantly through
different ratios and thresholds, among which, EMLL with threshold
1.0 performs the best in this task, giving rank correlation coefficient
of 0.67 i 0.16 when tested on the simulated profile1 contaminated
with Gaussian noise N (1.5), which is still considerably lower than
the rank correlation coefficients from mean, median or mode of the
DEtime package. In order to compare the performance of the algo—
rithm on data with varied signal—to—noise ratios, we adjusted the sig—
nal amplitude hyperparameter or and compared the results from
DEtime and nsgp with or : 1.5, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0. Supplementary
Table S1 illustrates the results which shows the robustness of the
proposed model. Supplementary Figure S1 shows the errorbar of the
mean, median, mode from DEtime package and EMLL with thresh—
olds of 0.5 and 1.0 from nsgp package across 100 replicates along
all perturbation times for all simulated datasets. We observe that the
DEtime package provides reasonable estimation of the initial per—
turbation time under various noise distributions whereas the per—
formance of the EMLL ratio from nsgp package varies substantially
and its performance seems to be deteriorating with later initial
perturbations.

We note that methods in the nsgp package are not designed spe—
cifically for the task of inferring the initial perturbation point as
they were proposed for the more general problem of identifying DE
regions. Nevertheless, a common application of time—series DE stud—
ies is to distinguish early and late DE events. We have demonstrated
that one can obtain greater accuracy by focusing on this specific task
rather than adapting a more general DE method.

3.3 Bacterial infection response in A. thaliana
To determine the biological utility of estimating perturbation times,
we re—examined a large dataset recently published by Lewis et al.
(2015) that captures the transcriptional reprogramming associated
with defence and disease development in A. thaliana leaves inocu—
lated with P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and the non—pathogenic
DC3000hrpA mutant strain. The differences in gene expression be—
tween these two challenges is a result of the action of virulence fac—
tors delivered by the DC3000 strain into the plant cell, in this case
predominately the collaborative activities of 28 bacterial effector
proteins. Figure 3 shows examples of an early and late perturbed
gene identified by our method. A preliminary investigation of the
perturbation times of differentially expressed genes revealed two
peak times (Supplementary Fig. S2), allowing genes to be assigned to
one of three groups: early, intermediate and late perturbed genes.
This initial characterization was consistent with major phase
changes in the infection process, and the onset of effector mediated
transcriptional reprogramming: effectors are not delivered into plant
cells until 90—120 min post inoculation (Grant et (11., 2000), and do
not promote bacterial growth until N8 hpi, when they have effect—
ively disabled host defence processes. This general progression is re—
ﬂected in GO and pathway analysis outlined in Supplementary

supporting evidence and additional novel insights not highlighted by
Lewis et al. (2015). To do so, genes were first grouped according to
their GO or AraCyc Pathway annotation, and the cumulative per—
turbation time for each term calculated. The time at which more
than 50% of the genes associated with a particular term were per—
turbed could then be used to rank terms, allowing a high resolution
understanding of the infection process. Heat maps showing the cu—
mulative density function (CDF) of perturbation times for each term
are shown in Supplementary Figures S4—S10. For clarity, we chose
to focus predominately on the earliest processes perturbed by bacter—
ial effectors as these are predicted to be processes integral to the sup—
pression of innate immunity. As an initial proof of concept we
focussed on the perturbation of hormone pathways, as modulation
of these pathways are well known to be integral to pathogen viru—
lence strategies (Fig. 4).

First we looked at abscisic acid (ABA) pathways, as it has previ—
ously been shown that DC3000 rapidly induces de novo ABA bio—
synthesis and hijacks ABA signalling pathways to promote virulence
(de Torres—Zabala et (11., 2007; de Torres Zabala et (11., 2009).
Figure 4A shows a strong link between various GOs associated with
ABA processes and early perturbation, which is what is predicted in
the literature and demonstrated by Lewis et al. (2015 ). Amongst
these early ABA signalling components induced were the classic
ABA responsive TFs, RD26 and both ATAIB and AFP2 were
induced around 2 hpi. This prediction suggests that effectors are tar—
geting ABA signaling very early in the infection process.
Furthermore > 50% of genes annotated with ‘regulation of abscisic
acid biosynthetic process’ were perturbed by 2.3 hpi, consistent with
measurable increased in de novo ABA biosynthesis 6 hpi, (de
Torres—Zabala et (11., 2007), with subsequent perturbation of ‘cellu—
lar response to abscisic acid stimulus’ occurring by 3.5 hpi. Two
genes showing perturbation at 4.1 hpi and annotated as ABA re—
sponsive, BLHL1 and TCP14, are predicted to be targeted by the
DC3000 effector AvrPto in yeast two hybrid protein—protein inter—
action studies (Mukhtar et (11., 2011). Moreover a knockout of
TCP14 results in enhanced disease resistance to DC3000, consistent
with TCP14 being a virulence target of effectors (Wefﬁling et (11.,
2014). Subsequently, a number of ABA related pathways appear to
be further targeted later in the infection. Interestingly ‘negative regu—
lation of abscisic acid—activated signaling pathway’ was perturbed at
4.4 hpi suggesting this is an example of a failed host response Lewis
et al. (2015). Other notable perturbed ABA related ontologies
included ‘abscisic acid transport’ (4.9 hpi), ‘abscisic acid catabolic
process’ (5.1 hpi), ‘abscisic acid binding’ (5.1 hpi), ‘abscisic acid—
activated signaling pathway’ (6.3 hpi), ‘abscisic acid biosynthetic
process’ (7.2 hpi) and ‘positive regulation of abscisic acid—activated
signaling pathway’ (7.2 hpi). Thus we can validate the importance
of ABA in the infection process but, moreover, using our estimation
of perturbation process we can see fine resolution of the increased
impact of ABA biosynthesis and signaling on the infection process
not evidenced by the previous analyses (Lewis et (11., 2015) as illus—
trated in Figure 4A.

As expected, we also identified strong early perturbations in sali—
cylic acid (Fig. 4B) related ontologies, as these are key targets for ef—
fector mediated suppression (DebRoy et (11., 2004). For further
validation, we looked at ontologies associated with the hormone jas—
monic acid (Fig. 4C). The JA ontologies show more delayed perturb—
ation than ABA, particularly notably the ontologies associated with
‘response to jasmonic acid’ (2.3 hpi), ‘jasmonic biosynthetic proc—
esses’ (3.7 hpi) and ‘regulation of jasmonic acid mediate signaling
pathways’ (3.8 hpi). This is consistent with the recent study by de
Torres et al. (2015) using a specific targeted analysis of the same

dataset which demonstrated that the JA contribution to DC3000
pathogenesis was preceded by a stronger ABA component. Thus
both the ABA and JA analyses provide two examples that validate
the utility of the perturbation estimation approach. Two other hor—
mone signalling pathways, gibberellic acid (Fig. 4D) and ethylene
(Fig. 4E), are predicted to play a minor role in establishment of viru—
lence, with their contributions only occurring late in the infection
process.

We next identified two signalling and two primary metabolism
pathways that are predicted to be important in the early conﬂict be—
tween plant defence and pathogen virulence: MAP kinase kinase
(MAPKK) activity, regulation of protein kinase activity, NAD bio—
synthesis process and methionine biosynthesis (Fig. 4F/ G).

MAMP signaling activates an early kinase phosphorylation cas—
cade that initiates transcriptional activation (Zipfel, 2014), however
little is known about the transcriptional activation or kinases.
Remarkably, 8 out of the 10 MAPKKs encoded by the Arabidopsis
genome were perturbed early. Given that these MAPKKs are respon—
sible for phosphorylation of the 20 downstream MAPKs their re—
spective roles are naturally extensive. However, MAPKKs are
strongly implicated in biotic stress. Most notably, the DC3000 ef—
fector HopF2 can interact with Arabidopsis MKK5 and most likely
other MAPKKs to inhibit MAPKs and PAMP—triggered immunity.
This is probably through MAPKK inhibition via ADP—ribosylation
as HopF2 delivery inhibited PAMP—induced MPK phosphorylation
(Wang et 41]., 2010). Functional evidence for a positive role of
MKKs in defence comes from work in tobacco, where transient ex—
pression of AtMKK7/AtMKK9 and AtMKK4/AtMKK5 caused a
hypersensitive response (Zhang et 41]., 2008). However, the roles of
MKKs are likely to be multifunctional and may be manipulated by
effectors to promote virulence. The MAPKK, MKK1 was shown to
negatively regulate immunity (Kong et 41]., 2012). This may be
through a dual role in activating ABA signalling as AtMKK1 as well
as AtMKK2 and AtMKK3, could activate the ABA responsive
RD29A promoter and MKK8 could activate the RD29B promoter
(HUA et al., 2006). Concomitant with perturbation of the MKK
pathway was a significant early perturbation of a sets of genes asso—
ciated with regulation of protein kinase activity. Strikingly, these
genes belong to a class of evolutionarily conserved kinases function—
ing as metabolic sensors and are activated in response to declining
energy levels. Their co—regulation is probably because they typically
function as a heterotrimeric complex comprising two regulatory
subunits, l)’ and v and an or—catalytic subunit. Intriguingly, a recent
study predicted that the two clade A type 2C protein phosphatases
that are negative regulators of ABA signalling, ABI1 and PP2CA,
negatively regulate the Snf1—related protein kinase1 and that PP2C
inhibition by ABA results in SnRK1 activation (Rodrigues et 41].,
2013). Moreover, SnRK1 and ABA were shown to induce largely
overlapping transcriptional responses, thus these data reveal a previ—
ously unknown link between ABA and energy signalling during
DC3000 infection.

A pathway intimately linked to energy signalling and redox reac—
tions is NAD biosynthesis, one of the most significantly perturbed
pathways following effector delivery (Fig. 4G). Although powdery
mildew infection of barley leaves was reported to be associated with
increased NAD content more than 40 years ago (Ryrie and Scott,
1969) and recently the identification of the fin4 (ﬂagellin insensitive
4) mutant as aspartate oxidase (Macho et 41]., 2012), a precursor of
the NANP biosynthetic pathway, the role of pyridines in plant de—
fence has received little attention. NAD and NADP play crucial roles
in pro—oxidant and antioxidant metabolism and have been linked to
biotic stress responses, including production of nitric oxide and me—
tabolism of reactive lipid derivatives (Crawford and Guo, 2005;
Mano et 41]., 2005 ). We highlight two possible, and contrasting,
roles for rapid induction of NAD biosynthesis components by ef—
fectors. First, it has recently been shown that chloroplast ROS pro—
duction is influenced by NADP:NADPH ratios and bacteria effector
delivery rapidly suppresses a MAMP triggered chloroplast burst of
hydrogen peroxide in an ABA dependent manner (de Torres Zabala
et 41]., 2015). Second, poly(ADP—Ribose) polymerases (PARPs) is
emerging as a key regulator of defence responses. PARPs are import—
ant NAD+ consuming enzymes induced by biotic stress, polymeriz—
ing long poly(ADP—ribose) chains on target proteins including
histones. Adams—Phillips et a1. (2010) reported a 40—50% decrease
in NAD+ 12 hpi of DC3000 challenged leaves compared to a mock

control and ~50% increase in total cellular and nuclear poly(ADP—
Rib) polymers (Adams—Phillips et al., 2010). Consistent with these
results, a knockout of PARP2, which is induced by MAMPs, re—
stricts DC3000 growth (Song et al., 2015) demonstrating that loss
of poly(ADP—ribosyl)ation activity affects the capacity of
Arabidopsis to limit DC3000 growth.

The second primary metabolism example we choose to highlight
is the very rapid induction methionine biosynthesis pathway (Fig.
4G). Methionine is a sulphur amino acid involved in multiple cellu—
lar processes from being a protein constituent, to initiation of
mRNA translation as well as functioning as a regulatory molecule in
the form of S—adenosylmethionine (SAM). There are 13 unique genes
associated with this ontology, and while it is outside the scope of
this manuscript to explore these in detail it is worth noting that this
includes DMR1 (Downy Mildew Resistance 1) (van Damme et al.,
2009), encoding homoserine kinase, which produces O—phospho—L—
homoserine, a compound at the branching point of methionine and
threonine biosynthesis. Mutations in dmr1 lead to elevated foliar
homoserine and resistance to the biotrophic pathogens
Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, Oidinm neolycopersici, F. cnlmo-
rum and F. graminearnm, although the mechanism has yet to be
identified (Brewer et al., 2014; Huibers et al., 2013; van Damme
et al., 2009).

Thus in summary, we have validated perturbation times against
previous analyses, and provide four new examples derived from
examining early perturbation times of biological pathways to iden—
tify novel signalling and, particularly, primary metabolic pathways
that are implicated in the transition from defence to disease follow—
ing infection with DC3000. These examples provide compelling
leads for further investigation.

4 Conclusion

We have introduced a fully Bayesian approach to infer the initial
point where two gene expression time profiles diverge using a novel
GP regression approach. We model the data as noise—corrupted sam—
ples coming from a shared function prior to some ‘perturbation time’
after which it splits into two conditionally independent functions. The
full posterior distribution of the perturbation point is obtained
through a simple histogram approach, providing a straightforward
method to infer the divergence time between two gene expression
time profiles under different conditions. The proposed method is
applied to a study of the timing of transcriptional changes in A. thali-
ana under a bacterial challenge with a wild—type and disarmed strain.
Analysis of differences in the gene expression profiles between strains
is shown to be informative about the immune response.

Many transcriptional perturbation experiments are focused on a
single perturbation. However, multiple perturbations occurring at
different times or a single perturbation targeting many conditions
will be needed to unmask complex gene regulatory strategies. An
interesting future line of research would be the development of GP
covariance structures to uncover the ordering of events under these
more general scenarios.

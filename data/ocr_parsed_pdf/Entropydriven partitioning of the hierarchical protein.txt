ABSTRACT

Motivation: Modern protein sequencing techniques have led to the
determination of >50 million protein sequences. ProtoNet is a cluster-
ing system that provides a continuous hierarchical agglomerative clus-
tering tree for all proteins. While ProtoNet performs unsupervised
classification of all included proteins, finding an optimal level of granu-
larity for the purpose of focusing on protein functional groups remain
elusive. Here, we ask whether knowledge-based annotations on pro-
tein families can support the automatic unsupervised methods for
identifying high-quality protein families. We present a method that
yields within the ProtoNet hierarchy an optimal partition of clusters,
relative to manual annotation schemes. The method’s principle is to
minimize the entropy-derived distance between annotation-based
partitions and all available hierarchical partitions. We describe the
best front (BF) partition of 2478328 proteins from UniRef50. Of
4929 553 ProtoNet tree clusters, BF based on Pfam annotations con-
tain 26 891 clusters. The high quality of the partition is validated by the
close correspondence with the set of clusters that best describe thou-
sands of keywords of Pfam. The BF is shown to be superior to na'i've
cut in the ProtoNet tree that yields a similar number of clusters. Finally,
we used parameters intrinsic to the clustering process to enrich a
priori the BF’s clusters. We present the entropy-based method’s
benefit in overcoming the unavoidable limitations of nested clusters
in ProtoNet. We suggest that this automatic information-based cluster
selection can be useful for other large-scale annotation schemes, as
well as for systematically testing and comparing putative families
derived from alternative clustering methods.

Availability and implementation: A catalog of BF clusters for thou-
sands of Pfam keywords is provided at http://protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/

1 INTRODUCTION

The explosive growth in the number of sequenced proteins is
mostly a result of the breakthroughs in sequencing technologies
and the corresponding sequencing of hundreds of organisms.
Despite these advances, the structure and function of most of
these proteins remains unknown. The most successful method for
functional annotation of proteins is by sequence alignment, hom-
ology detection and inference techniques. Generalization of such
approaches calls for charting the protein space by clustering or
classiﬁcation (Radivojac et al., 2013). If successful, each such
group of proteins would represent a ‘family’. Classiﬁcation into
families is a critical component in structural and functional
genomics. No accepted consensus exists for how many of these
protein families might comprise the entire protein-space
(Coordinators, 2014). There are ~30 000 main orthologous

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

groups (Fischer et al., 2011) in addition to rare and peculiar
single proteins. With the increased number of complete prote-
omes, a phyletic partition shows that thousands of families are
associated with each multicellular organism. Various expert-
based databases provide a good description of protein families
(Mi et al., 2013; Punta et al., 2012). For example, InterPro (IPR)
is composed of 25 000 models for families and domains and from
a structural perspective, there are ~2600 superfamilies according
to CATH classiﬁcation (Sillitoe et al., 2013).

Classifying the entire protein space into families serves not
only as a method for large-scale protein annotations but also
to support functional and structural genomic initiatives
(Loewenstein et al., 2009). Some prominent examples for protein
classiﬁcation are SYSTERS (Liu and Rost, 2003), CluSTr
(Petryszak et al., 2005) and ProtoNet (Rappoport et al., 2013).
The shared theme of all these resources is the hierarchical nature
of the protein families. Furthermore, while all use BLAST-based
statistical distance metrics for the clustering, the implementation,
sensitivity, the notion of the distance metrics and consequently
the depth of the hierarchical representations are different for
each of the underlying algorithm and resource (Liu and Rost,
2003).

An important differentiating factor between various classiﬁca-
tion systems is the level of granularity. More often than not,
deﬁnitions regarding the granularity are made arbitrarily, not
based on natural or systematic considerations. The importance
of granularity stems from the inherent diversity of the protein
space. While some families are well deﬁned by their sequence
(e.g. Rubisco, Ribosomal proteins), the boundaries of many
other protein families are blurred. To complicate things even
further, some families may be best deﬁned by a composition of
several subfamilies, while others are part of large and multifunc-
tional superfamilies (e. g. AAA superfamily, G protein coupled
receptors, protein kinases). Gene Ontology database (GO) (Gene
Ontology Consortium et al., 2013) and to some extent IPR
(Radivojac et al., 2013) incorporate the notion of parent/child re-
lationships for gene/protein family in cases where such relation-
ships are accepted. For example, the ‘Neurotransmitter-gated
ion-channel (IPR006201)’ is a parent of ‘5-hydroxytryptamine
3 receptor (IPR008132)’, which is itself divided into two related
subfamilies of A and B subunits (IPR008133 and IPR008134,
respectively).

To tackle the issue of varying granularity, we suggest a method
that searches among a hierarchical tree for the ‘front’ of clusters
that have a minimal entropy-based ‘distance’ from the optimal
annotation-based partition. The method can be used for seeking
the best matching partition, relative to any existing classiﬁcation
system. In our work, we assess the quality of clusters of a con-
struction of the ProtoNet system, which is a fully automatic tree
of protein sequences (Rappoport et al., 2013).

Entropy-driven partitioning of the hierarchical protein space

 

We choose for this purpose Pfam, an extensive documentation
of domains and families that represents one of the most reliable
sources for protein families (Finn et al., 2014). Pfam is a
semiautomatic family database with a strict quality control. It
contains ~14000 models for protein families and covers almost
80% of known protein sequences with ~50% coverage of amino
acids. As such, Pfam is an extremely valuable resource for ad-
dressing questions concerning the quality of structural and func-
tional protein families.

The classiﬁcation provided by ProtoNet is based on a bottom-
up unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Kaplan
et al., 2005; Sasson et al., 2003). Speciﬁcally, it provides a full
range of cluster granularity; from single proteins to huge clusters
that carry minimal biological coherence (the root clusters). It is
possible to match the majority of Pfam families to speciﬁc clus-
ters within the ProtoNet clustering. Moreover, we search for
‘natural’ clustering partitions, from which the optimal granular-
ity can be inferred. The intuition for such a natural partition is
for it to be ‘entropically close’ to a partition based on Pfam
annotations of the proteins.

In this article, we describe the theoretical basis for a novel
entropy-based procedure for best front (BF) searching. To
allow for a priori prediction of the BF, we introduce additional
intrinsic clustering parameters that partially separate the entire
set of clusters present and those that are included in the BF. We
show that a combination of two such parameters is enough to
strongly enrich the BF from all clusters. Our method to identify
optimal granularity allows for automatic and systematic defin-
ition of the set of proteins that correspond to an orthologous
family. Such automatic definition could supplement current tech-
niques in genome-wide annotation projects, which are mostly
based on expert annotation (Barker et al., 2001). Furthermore,
it will serve to deﬁne families using the matching of a large
number of classiﬁcation systems such as MetaFam (Silverstein
et al., 2001), Superfamily (Wilson et al., 2009) and more.

We show that the automatic information-based cluster selec-
tion of the BF is extremely useful for a systematic comparing of
clustering methods. Furthermore, the supervised approach can
be applied to biochemical functions (such as enzyme classiﬁca-
tion), as well as for structural superfamilies. We provide a com-
plete catalog of the BF clusters for >10000 IPR keywords.

2 METHODS
2.1 Databases and sources

2.1.] ProtoNet tree The tools and methods described in this art-
icle were applied to the ProtoNet protein classiﬁcation system.
ProtoNet implements agglomerative hierarchical clustering using several
merging strategies. For the sake of simplicity, we choose to discuss only
one of the merging strategies offered by ProtoNet, called the ‘Arithmetic’
merging strategy (Sasson et al., 2003). ProtoNet (version 6.1) provides a
classiﬁcation hierarchy that covers ~9 000 000 proteins from the
UniProtKB database (release 15.4). We have not discussed the expanded
version of ProtoNet that covers ~20 million proteins (Rappoport et al.,
2013). We clustered 2478 328 representative proteins as deﬁned by
UniRefSO. In the clustering tree, there are 4929 553 clusters and 27 103
roots (mostly singletons). ProtoNet is available at http://www.protonet.
cs.huji.ac.il.

2.1.2 ProtoNet clustering measurements The agglomerative hier-
archical clustering scheme deﬁnes a set of terms that are intrinsically asso-
ciated with the process. In such a scheme, each cluster is created from
smaller clusters, which are captured as its descendants in the clustering tree.

ProtoLevel (PL) ranges from 0 to 100 and is used as a standard quan-
titative measure of the relative height of a cluster in the merging tree.
Indirectly, the PL of a cluster reﬂects the global average of the sequence
similarity BLAST E-score between proteins in the cluster. The PL of the
leaves of the tree is deﬁned as 0, whereas the PL of a root equals 100. The
larger the PL, the later the merging that created the cluster took place.
Therefore, the PL scale is considered as an ‘internal timer’ of merges
during the clustering process.

The lifetime (LT) of a cluster is the difference between PL at its cre-
ation and its termination. The LT of a cluster reﬂects its remoteness from
the clusters in its ‘vicinity’. Explanations for additional terms that de-
scribe the clustering process such as depth, connectivity and compactness
are available on the ProtoNet Web site (see above).

2.1.3 Protein family annotations A total of 10 337 annotations from
Pfam and a total of 11327 keywords from IPR Family were used as
external protein family annotation sources. Of the 2478328 UniRefSO
proteins, 50% have at least one Pfam annotation.

2.2 Keyword correspondence scores

To measure the correspondence between a given cluster and a speciﬁc
annotation, we deﬁne the notion of a correspondence score (CS). The CS
for a certain cluster C and a given keyword K measures the correlation
between the cluster and the keyword, using the well-known intersect-
union ratio:

CS(C, K) = |c ﬂ kl/lc U kl = TP/(TP-i-FP-i-FN) Where c is the set of
annotated proteins in cluster C, and k is the set of proteins annotated
with the keyword K.

TP, FP and FN stand for true positives, false positives and false nega-
tives, respectively.

0 TP is the number of proteins in cluster C that have keyword anno-
tation K.

o FP is the number of annotated proteins in cluster C that do not have
keyword annotation K.

0 FN is the number of proteins not in cluster C that have keyword
annotation K.

The cluster receiving the maximal score for keyword K is considered to be
the cluster that best represents K within the ProtoNet tree. The score for a
given cluster on keyword K ranges from 0 (no correspondence) to 1 (a
cluster containing exactly all of the proteins with keyword K maximally
corresponds to the keyword).

For annotation keywords from several external sources, we deﬁne the
cluster with the best CS for each keyword as the best cluster for this keyword.

The sources used for deﬁning the best clusters as well as their CS are
IPR (families and domains), Pfam, SCOP (fold, superfamily, family and
domain levels), GO (in three categoriesimolecular function, cellular pro-
cess and cellular localization), CATH (architecture, class, homology and
topology) and ENZYME (four levels of the EC hierarchy). For a detailed
description on the database and structure of the annotation sources see
(Rappoport et al., 2012). For simplicity, we describe in details only the
results of the information-theoretical method for Pfam and IPR.

2.3 Information-theoretic approach for searching optimal
protein partition

For a given keyword annotation type, we would like to find, within the

hierarchical ProtoNet tree, the set of clusters whose partition of the set of

annotated proteins maximally corresponds to the partition of the proteins
induced by their annotations. We use an information-theoreticibased
approach to ﬁnd the set of protein-disjoint clusters having the minimal
‘distance’ from the keyword-induced partition of the proteins. Each pro-
tein in the system has :0 keyword annotations, as deﬁned by a given
external source.

Let P be the set of all proteins in the system, KW the set of all key-
words in the system and CL the set of all ProtoNet clusters.

For a protein [7 e P, deﬁne k(p) as the set of all k 6 KW s.t. k anno-
tates [7.

We thus deﬁne the following:

9: {(k,p)|p e P,k e KW}

S2 = set of couples (keyword, protein) where the protein [7 has the
speciﬁc annotation k.

c = the set of the proteins in cluster C.
f = a given front in the ProtoNet tree

= a protein-disjoint set of ProtoNet clusters that together cover the
whole space

= a partition of the protein space.

We deﬁne the mapping function: Q : S2 —> CL as

Cf(k, p) = the unique cluster of p in f

And deﬁne K: S2 —> KW as K(k,p)=k.

These are the projections on the ﬁrst and second coordinate,
respectively.

Our underlying probability distribution is uniform:

War) 6 9 i Pr(16,17)=1/|fl|
Thus for any k 6 KW, c 6 CL:

1
Z Pr(k,p)= “mm” c e f

P K=k, C =c = —,
( f ) (k,p)E§2,pEL' Q

0, otherwise

We then deﬁne, using the Rokhlin metric (Katok, 1995), the ‘distance’
between the keyword-induced partition (K) and the partition deﬁned by f
(Cf) as

<1>(K, Cf) = H(K|Cf) —l— H(Cf|K)
H( YlX) is the conditional entropy of Y given X, deﬁned as

—Zp(X=x, Y=y)log(p(Y=in=x»

X J"

Minimizing this distance captures the intuition of attempting to find a
generalized ‘equivalence’ between speciﬁc protein clusters in f and speciﬁc
keyword annotations.

We then attempt to ﬁnd the optimal ProtoNet front f* such that

f‘ = arg min j«<I>(K, Cf)

We used an algorithm to calculate f* (‘the best front’ = BF) from the
leaves of the tree upward, using the fact that the score of a front f is
simply the summated score contributions of its member clusters. The
algorithm has linear (O(n)) time complexity in the number of clusters
in the tree.

Note that any cluster consisting solely of non-annotated proteins are
transparent to this method due to the fact that all such cluster’s proteins
have an effective probability of 0.

Once the BF has been calculated, we can analyze in several ways. We
can compare its clusters’ CS to individual keyword annotations to see
which of the clusters in the front are practically equivalent to a spe-
ciﬁc annotation. This is done for each keyword using the

above-deﬁned keyword CS. We also compare its maximally obtained
scores to the maximum scores in the whole ProtoNet tree. In addition,
we look for intrinsic clustering parameters that separate the BF clusters
from non-BF clusters.

3 RESULTS

3.1 ProtoNet clusters assignment as Best Global, Best
Front and Best Cut

ProtoNet relies on unsupervised automatic agglomerative clus-
tering method. Figure 1 illustrates the scaffold of the ProtoNet
tree. The leaves (i.e. individual proteins) represent the UniRef50
representative proteins. The term ‘Best Clusters’ is assigned for
clusters according to a speciﬁc annotation resource (e.g. Pfam)
and its keywords. We label clusters as ‘best’ according to the
maximal CS. For each keyword the CS ranges from 0 to 1.0
(see Methods, Section 2.2). We used three partitions and deﬁn-
itions throughout the analysis: (i) Best Global (BG) clusters,
covering the best CS cluster among all ProtoNet clusters; (ii)
Clusters that have a maximal CS at a predetermined PL [Best
Cut (BC) cluster] and (iii) the newly developed entropy-based
partitions, called the BF clusters.

Figure 1 shows that some clusters may be ‘best’ for more than
one keyword. Evidently, for a specific keyword the BG can be
assigned to both parent and child clusters but this is not legitim-
ate for the BF and BC clusters.

maximal CS values. However, the BF and BC clusters are restricted by
the partition of proteins into disjoint clusters. Some clusters maybe ‘best’
for more than one keyword. The illustration is according to a speciﬁc
annotation resource (e.g. Pfam). The same scheme applies for other an-
notation resources [e. g. the Homology level in CATH classiﬁcation (Cuff
et al., 2009)]. The PL (ranges 07100) and the Life Time (LT, range 07100)
are internal measurements of the ProtoNet tree

were deﬁned as the BF. This number reﬂects an average com-
pressing factor of 92 from the number of initial proteins included
in the analysis. Recall that using the UniRef50 protein marked a
5.7 compression level on average (not shown). Thus, the BF
partition of UniRef50 sequences yields an effective compression
of 30(F500 folds. In addition, the number of clusters in the BF is
only 0.5% of the original number of clusters. These 26 981 clus-
ters contained 2119 556 of the 2478 328 proteins. Of these
2 119 556 BF proteins (86% of all proteins), 17237 proteins
(0.8%) had no annotations.

The family size and features of homologous protein families
have been extensively investigated. In Figure 2, the size distribu-
tions of the clusters in the BF and the keyword groups in IPR
family. The two size distributions are similar, but the groups of
IPR keywords tend to be slightly smaller on average. Almost all
of the clusters in the BF contained 5500 proteins (Fig. 2). The
paired t-test of sizes’ distribution does not reject the null hypoth-
esis (P—Value = 0.7). The intersection between the clusters of IPR
BG clusters and the BF clusters is surprisingly low (only 623
clusters, 12% of the IPR clusters). While the size of the cluster
is a good indicator for overall familial correspondence, it does
not provide any direct information on the purity and quality of
the BF clusters.

3.3 Quality assessment of BF clusters

In assessing the resulting BF on a larger scale, we compared the
maximal CS within the BF to the maximal CS for all ProtoNet
clusters, for each IPR family keyword annotation.

Such a comparison can indicate how well the hierarchical tree
was ‘compressed’ into the BF, Vis-a-Vis its performance for each
IPR keyword. Such compression, if it is sufﬁciently informative
in terms of its CS on speciﬁc keywords, is obviously more useful
than a global search for each keyword’s maximum scoring clus-
ter (defined as BG clusters). The former yields a disjoint partition
of the protein space that does not act as an essential constrain for
the BG maximum scoring CS clusters (Fig. 1).

Fig. 2. Distribution of cluster sizes in the BF (dark gray) relative to the
distribution of IPR (light gray) family keyword sizes (columns’ heights
are normalized). Most clusters in the BF contain ~1(F100 proteins (the
mean and median cluster size is 78.8 and 21, respectively). The mean and
median sizes of the number of protein appearances in IPR keyword
groups are 63 and 16, respectively

The BG maximal CS distributions for ProtoNet clusters and
the BF clusters are shown (Fig. 3). A leftward shift of the score
distribution is observed, due to the fact that the maximal scoring
cluster is not necessarily included in the BF. However, since the
shift is modest, it is also apparent that the success of the BF, as
measured by its individual CS values, is high. The high match of
the BF clusters with the IPR keywords applied for many of the
IPR keywords, indicating that the BF retained signiﬁcant know-
ledge regarding the nature of the individual IPR keywords.
Weighting the CS by the size of the clusters suggests that the
average CS of the BF cluster is higher than the non-weighted
CS average value. The average maximal CS was ~0.71 and the
statistical signiﬁcance for achieving such correspondence is
P—Value < lE—300.

A close inspection of hundreds of examples of protein families
revealed that many of the BF clusters merges with the maximal
correspondence-scoring (BG) clusters for those families. For ex-
ample, cluster 4802079 corresponds to ‘BolA-like protein’ key-
word (CS : 0.98). Cluster 4768763 corresponds to the ‘Cysteine
dioxygenase type 1’ keyword (CS = 0.99). Such examples were
relatively abundant, indicating that the BF contained clusters
that, in addition to being part of the optimal global solution
for the BF, were optimal for a speciﬁc keyword.

Figure 3 shows a quality assessment of the BF clusters for all
5150 IPR clusters (a minimal size of 20 proteins for each IPR
keyword). We compared the CS value relative to BG clusters that
are not restricted to any partition of the tree and in principle can
have a maximal CS occurs in a parentwhild hierarchy.
Interestingly, for the BF clusters, the dominating bins cover
the CS>0.9. In this bin there are 52 and 73% of the BF and
BG clusters, respectively.

3.4 A comparison of the BF to a PL—deﬁned partition

clusters (0.5%).

Fig. 4. The distribution of the BG clusters with at least 20 appearances
(dark gray) and BF (light gray) clusters that include at least 20 proteins
according to the PL (X-axis). The BF clusters show a similar distribution
along the entire scale of PL values. PL90 covers the highest number of
BG clusters. Evidently, the performance of the BF clusters on any key-
word would always be bounded by the performance of all ProtoNet
clusters

(i.e. ‘cut’) that have the largest intersection with the best clusters
for IPR family. Figure 4 shows that the BC merges with PL 90
(i.e. the clusters were created before PL90 and were terminated
after PL90). The set of clusters in PL90 achieves the highest
median CS (0.89) for IPR Family keywords and the value is
substantially lower for the IPR keywords that cover domains
(32% of all keywords). Among all the BF clusters, 3071 (979
clusters with size 320) are also included in PL90. Hence, it
might be expected, due to its similar number of clusters and
~22% overlap rate, that the performance of the maximally cor-
respondence-scoring clusters in PL90 would be similar to the
performance of the maximally correspondence-scoring clusters
in the BF. However, for most individual keywords, the max-
imally scoring BF cluster has a score equal to or greater than
the maximally scoring PL90 cluster, with a median of 0.91 versus
0.89 for BF clusters and PL90 clusters accordingly (t-test P—value
of 3E-27), and median sensitivity of 0.99 versus 0.98 (t-test
P—value of 4E-193). We compared the performance (measured
by the CS or the sensitivity) of PL90 BC and the BF clusters
(Fig. 5, top). The density of points above and around the bound-
ing line indicates that for many keywords the BF corresponds
to the keyword outperforms the maximally scoring cluster of BC
of PL90.

Figure 5 (bottom) shows that a complex IPR keywords of
‘kinase’(141, total of 217000 annotated proteins) resulted in
average CS of 0.68 relative to 0.59 that is associated with the
BC of PL90. The other ‘cuts’ (PL80, 85, 95) performs lower than
that for the BC partition.

Table 1 shows a sample of IPR keywords where the CS of the
BF clusters is substantially higher than the best cluster in the
PL90 cut. There are >120 clusters (covers 44 000 proteins) for
which the improvement of the CS of BF relative to the BC is
substantial (additional of >0.3 units of the CS). Note that the BF
clusters are substantially small when compared with the BC clus-
ters (Table 1). Capturing the keyword accurately by the BF is

Entropy-driven partitioning of the hierarchical protein space

 

best explained by matching with the subfamily level of
the keywords.

3.5 Intrinsic features of the hierarchical clustering

Once we assessed the quality of the BF based on its CS perform-
ance for IPR keywords, we tested whether the clusters of the BF
could be characterized by intrinsic parameters of the clustering
process.

The underlying motivation is that ProtoNet is created by a
fully automatic procedure with no prior knowledge of the protein
features or annotations, besides their pairwise alignment scores.
But, as a high percentage of the clusters in ProtoNet contain at
least one of the 10 337 Pfam family annotations (50% of proteins
have at least one such annotation), it would be desirable to char-
acterize a set of clusters, in terms of their ‘expected correlation’ to
an annotation source such as Pfam, by learning the intrinsic
features of the clustering procedure. Such learned features
could be used to predict, a priori the most likely front that
best describes Pfam (or any other selected knowledge-based an-
notations). Such a compressed representation of the hierarchical
clustering would simplify the protocol for restricted search of
informative clusters in the hierarchical protein space.

An intrinsic value of the clustering process is a cluster’s Life
Time (LT, see Methods). We tested the feature of the LT in view
of the set of BF clusters as well as the entire ProtoNet tree.
Figure 6 quantiﬁes the observation that the BF clusters can be
partially inferred from their LT. For example, at a LT of 0.5:
only 29% of all clusters have LT>0.5; however, 59% of BF
clusters have LT>0.5. Clearly one such clustering parameter
cannot replace the knowledge-based information. We therefore
search an additional parameter that corresponds with the BF
clusters. A useful parameter in defining the BF is the cluster
size. The intrinsic ProtoNet parameters include the combination
of the threshold of LT>0.5, with a minimal number of proteins
in a cluster be >10.

Applying the two thresholds to all clusters yielded 269 233
clusters, while application to the BF clusters yielded only 6609
clusters. The original fraction of the 26981 BF clusters among all
clusters is a mere 0.5%, while the fraction following the minimal
thresholds of cluster size >10 and LT >0.5 is 3.5%. Thus, using
these internal parameters we signiﬁcantly enriched a set that in-
cludes many of the BF clusters. In fact, each cluster is associated
with a larger set of parameters, such as its size, depth, LT, com-
pactness and connectivity. The idea that a combination of such
features could characterize a valid robust cluster is appealing
and was extensively used to prune many of the less informative
clusters (Rappoport et al., 2013).

4 DISCUSSION

The novel method described here offers a systematic framework
to address the quality of protein classiﬁcation systems. While we
use ProtoNet as our test bed, it is important to note that the tools
and methods presented here are by no means limited in their
scope to ProtoNet. These can be tailored to other hierarchical
classiﬁcation systems.

The procedure is valid and expandable to other types of an-
notations. It can possibly serve to suggest the BF for structural

Fig. 6. A cumulative frequency cluster LT histogram. LTs are shown for
clusters in the Pfam-based BF (solid line), and for all clusters within
ProtoNet (dashed line). Note that while >80% of all clusters are
below a LT of 0.3, only <1% of clusters of the BF are characterized
by such a LT

and functional annotations (such as SCOP, CATH). However, it
must be noted that the procedure is currently only suited to an-
notation types with approximately one level of granularity.
Application of the method to a notably hierarchical annotation
type, such as GO protein annotations, has determined (unpub-
lished results) that the BF is the root containing all the proteins.
This is due to the fact that many GO annotations are not sep-
arable; i.e. there is a large, inherent, minimal level of ‘entropy’
within the GO annotations [see discussion in (Radivojac et al.,
2013)].

Our work shows that application of the annotation-based op-
timal partitioning procedure to the ProtoNet tree yielded a
highly compressed number of protein clusters, which are often
highly correlated with individual IPR keywords. In addition, we
showed that an inherent property of clustering, the LT, could be
used to remove clusters that will probably not be part of the BF
partition. The combination of these two results suggests the pos-
sibility of an automatic classiﬁcation method that would be cap-
able of reconstructing the vast majority of Pfam/IPR knowledge
(in terms of family boundaries). An example for such automatic
support could be submission of novel unannotated sequences to
the ProtoNet BF partition, and assigning (with a certain prob-
ability) the sequence to one of the BF clusters (each essentially
equivalent to a certain protein family).

An issue not yet addressed is the application of the method
to a general set of protein annotations. The distance measure
deﬁned here has a theoretical minimum of 0; however, this
value will not be the true lower bound for most annotation sys-
tems, as even having 1 protein with 2 different annotations (per-
haps due to its being composed of multiple non-overlapping
domains) will not allow the H(K] Cf) term to go to 0, for any
partition of the proteins. Allowing the splitting of a protein into
its domains could address this problem. Additionally, calculation
of the minimal theoretical value of the distance could be used to
put the BF score in the context of its feasible values, implicitly
part of the annotation system used. This theoretical lower bound
essentially deﬁnes the ‘entropy’ inherent in an annotation system.

The ProtoNet tree that is the basis for the information-
theoretic approach is based on UniRef50. This implies that
each cluster maybe weighted by hundreds of sequences. For ex-
ample, in mammals there are 1036 protein sequences named
‘hemoglobin’ and 3625 named ‘hydrolase’. These sets in
UniRef50 are compressed to 62 and 840 representatives, respect-
ively. Therefore, the current analysis for ProtoNet that is com-
posed of 2.5 million representatives is challenging with respect to
the task in this study. However, extending the analysis for the
expanded version of UniProtKB meets the limitation of compu-
tation feasibility (not shown). The current UniProtKB release
3_2014 already contains 54 million sequences and ~10 million
in UniRef50. The statistical- and information-driven method
presented allowing a rational navigating in such large resource.
In future work we will further validate BF hierarchies using stat-
istical learning methods. Such tests are meant to reﬂect how well
the BF would perform in an unsupervised setting. Preliminary
results (not shown) indicate that the BF method is both robust
and valid.

The main drawback of the approach described above is its
need for externally defined protein annotations. Therefore, we
would like to be able to learn the intrinsic parameters of a given
system that predict, with minimal error, the clusters in a charac-
teristic BF. Fortunately, the amount (and quality) of protein
annotation is rapidly increasing, with Pfam already including
~14200 annotations. The information-theoretic approach de-
veloped here can only beneﬁt from such trends, without sacriﬁ-
cing computational efﬁciency or accuracy.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The formulation of the entropy-based method was initiated by
Noam Kaplan and Menachem Fromer. The concept of an en-
tropy-based partition was carefully tested by Menachem Fromer,
and the performance of the best-front was also determined by
him for an early version of ProtoNet that was based on se-
quences from SwissProt (114K proteins). The current research
uses the concept and the working ﬂow for the most recent ver-
sion of ProtoNet. We thank the ProtoNet team and Solange

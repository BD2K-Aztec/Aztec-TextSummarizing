ABSTRACT

Mononucleotide repeats (MNRs) are abundant in eukaryotic
genomes and exhibit a high degree of length variability due to
insertion and deletion events. However, the relationship between
these repeats and mutation rates in surrounding sequences has not
been systematically investigated. We have analyzed the frequency
of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at positions close to and
within MNRs in the human genome. Overall, we find a 2- to 4-fold
increase in the SNP frequency at positions immediately adjacent to
the boundaries of MNRs, relative to that at more distant bases. This
relationship exhibits a strong asymmetry between 3’ and 5’ ends
of repeat tracts and is dependent upon the repeat motif, length
and orientation of surrounding repeats. Our analysis suggests that
the incorporation or exclusion of bases adjacent to the boundary
of the repeat through substitutions, in which these nucleotides
mutate towards or away from the base present within the repeat,
respectively, may be another mechanism by which MNRs expand
and contract in the human genome.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tandem repeats of short sequence motifs are common in the
genomes of eukaryotic species (Ellegren, 2004). Lander et al. (2001)
estimated that microsatellites with repeat motifs between 1 and 6 bp
account for at least 3% of the human genome. Mononucleotide
repeats (MNRs), repeats of a single base, are the most abundant
Class of microsatellites in the human genome (Toth et al., 2000).
However, this Class of repeats has been frequently overlooked in
studies of microsatellite evolution and variation.

One of the most salient Characteristics of short tandem repeats is
the high variability in length exhibited by these sequences within
populations due to the insertion or deletion of repeat units, most
likely reﬂecting difﬁculties in replication and repair (Levinson and
Gutman, 1987; Wierdl et al., 1997). This variability has led to
the widespread use of these sequences as polymorphic markers
(Kong et al., 2002; Kopelman et al., 2009). For MNRs, this type
of instability is an important Characteristic of some tumors, in

particular, mismatch repair deﬁcient cancers of the gut and ovary
(Buhard et al., 2006; Kawaguchi et al., 2009).

Alterations in the rate and spectrum of point mutations have
also been reported in sequences surrounding microsatellites. Several
studies considering small numbers of di- and trinucleotide repeats
have found evidence of an increase in the mutation rate near the
repeat (Brohede and Ellegren, 1999; Djian et al., 1996; Vowles
and Amos, 2004). However, there is a lack of consensus regarding
this trend with other publications proposing that the frequency
of mutations decreases toward microsatellites (Varela and Amos,
2010), or remains stable (Karhu et al., 2000).

In this article, we have investigated the relationship between
MNRs and mutation rates in the human genome. Using data from
the dbSNP database, we took the number of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the region surrounding MNRs as a
measure of the propensity of a particular site to be affected by
mutations. We hypothesized that any variation in the frequency of
SNPs is likely to be strongest at positions Closest to the repeat, as
homopolymeric regions are more likely to be subject to errors during
replication which could result in the misincorporation of a base at
adjacent positions (Brohede and Ellegren, 1999). The boundaries
of MNRs can also be more easily and Clearly deﬁned than those
of repeats with longer motifs since sources of ambiguity such as
adjacent truncated motifs do not occur. Therefore, by using MNRs
we were able to focus in particular on positions immediately adjacent
to the repeat in order to discern, with greater accuracy, the extent
to which any Change in mutation rate is speciﬁc to the bases at the
boundary between repetitive and unique sequence.

2 METHODS

2.1 Datasets

All MNRs of 33 bp were extracted from the hg18 assembly of the
human reference genome (http://genome.ucsc.edu) using a perl script. Only
repeats in autosomes were included in the present analysis. Mutations
occurring close to MNR tracts were identiﬁed using the dbSNP130 database
(http://genome.ucsc.edu). All SNPs for which the method used to validate
the variant was known (8.5 million) were included in the analysis.

2.2 Analysis

To focus speciﬁcally on local differences in SNP frequency around MNRs.
we examined 10 bp either side of each repeat tract as well as the ﬁrst and last
three bases of the repeat itself. The distribution of SNPs was then analyzed
according to repeat type. repeat length. base change and orientation.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A total of 176.9 million autosomal MNRs 33bp in length were
identiﬁed. As T and G repeats are the same as A and C repeats,

respectively, but in the opposite orientation, it is common practice to
standardize MNRs into polyA (including A and T repeats) and polyC
(including C and G repeats) (Katti et al., 2001; Koﬂer et al., 2007).
All MNRs analyzed were standardized according to this convention.

Over 122 million polyA and 54 million polyC repeats were
extracted from the human genome (Supplementary Table 1). The
frequency of repeats decreased with increasing length with polyC
repeats showing a faster rate of decline, and therefore shorter mean
and maximum lengths, than polyA repeat tracts (Fig. 1).

3.1 Relationship between diversity and position

We initially assessed the SNP diversity at positions surrounding
MNRs of length >5 bp, as this is slightly below the proposed
threshold for slippage mutations in MNRs (Lai and Sun, 2003; Rose
and Falush, 1998). We designated positions from 1 to 10bp outside
the MNR as e.1—e.10 and the ﬁrst and last three bases inside the
repeat as i.1—i.3, where the number reﬂects the distance from the
MNR boundary. These designations can occur either 5’ or 3’ of the
MNR, where the strand used is the one on which the MNR is encoded
as a polyA or a polyC tract.

We observed an increased diversity at positions immediately
adjacent to the MNR boundary compared with more distant positions
(Fig. 2). However, differences in the relationship between MNRs
and SNP frequency between polyA and polyC repeats suggests that

this relationship is further inﬂuenced by the repeat motif. In polyA
repeats, this increase was largest at the ﬁrst positions outside the
microsatellite, while polyC tracts showed the greatest excess of
mutations at the ﬁrst and ﬁnal bases of the repeat itself. Looking
beyond the repeat boundaries, the diversity at bases between 3 and
10 bp from the repeat remained virtually constant and was similar for
both Classes of repeat (~ 3 X 10‘3). Within the repeat, focusing only
on the ﬁrst and last three bases, diversity for polyA repeats fell below
that of external, non-boundary positions, consistent with previous
observations from CA microsatellites (Brohede and Ellegren, 1999).
In contrast, in polyC repeats, diversity remained elevated relative to
that of more distant positions, though it did fall at positions further
inside the repeat.

We also observed a marked 5’ to 3’ asymmetry at the boundaries
of repeat tracts (Fig. 2). This indicated that the 3’ end of a repeat—on
the strand where the MNR is encoded as an A or C tract—has a higher
frequency of mutations relative to the 5’ end (polyA 5’ =2><, 3’ =
2.8 X; polyC 5’ =2.4><, 3’ =4.1 ><). There was ﬁlrther a larger effect
at the boundaries of polyC repeats compared with polyA repeats
based on a X2 test (P < 1 X 10T16). This asymmetry is reminiscent of
observations made in dinucleotide repeats and certain minisatellites
(Varela et al., 2008; Vowles and Amos, 2004).

Repeat tracts can be difﬁcult to sequence (Lunter et al., 2008;
Shinde et al., 2003). It is, therefore, possible that the excess of
SNPs observed in bases adjacent to these repeats was an artifact.
To assess whether such errors were likely to inﬂuence our results,
we selected well-Characterized SNPs, for which allele frequencies
have been determined, and repeated the analysis using SNPs with a
minor allele frequency (MAF) 20.05 (3 million). The distribution
of SNPs relative to MNRs was found to be very similar to that
observed using the ﬁill database (Supplementary Fig. 2). The strong
similarity between these analyses indicates that conclusions drawn
from the full dataset are unlikely to be the result of artifacts.
We also aligned 667 submitted sequences (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
corresponding to 100 SNPs, adjacent to MNRs, to the hg18 assembly
of the human reference sequence. Of these, only two sequences
showed ambiguities in the alignment around the location of the SNP,
which may indicate the presence of an insertion or deletion event.
Moreover, that we consistently observed in our results such a Clear
excess of SNPs only in the bases at the repeat boundary, and that
polyA and polyC repeats were found to have different relationships
with the mutation rate at adjacent bases suggests that sequencing or
alignment issues are not likely to be inﬂuencing the results.

To show that our ﬁndings are likely to reﬂect mutational processes
affecting all MNRs and are not inﬂuenced by constraints due to their
location, for example in coding or transcribed regions, we reanalyzed
our data according to the genomic regions in which these repeats
are found. Repeats were annotated according to whether they;
overlapped with coding regions, were within the mature transcripts
of protein-coding genes but outside the coding regions, were located
in introns or were found in intergenic regions. We observed that the
relative differences in the mutation rate at the boundary positions
of MNRs are similar irrespective of the location of the repeat
(Supplementary Table 2).

3.2 Relationship between diversity and repeat length

To establish whether the relationship between MNRs and mutation
rate is dependent on repeat length, SNP diversity at the boundaries of

repeat tracts was analyzed according to repeat size. We included only
repeats of 39 bp as beyond this the frequency of repeats became too
low to draw reliable conclusions for the less-abundant polyC repeats.

Diversity increased with repeat length in both polyA and polyC
repeats up to 9bp at positions adjacent to the repeat boundary
(Fig. 3). This trend, however, was substantially more marked in
repeats of 35 bp suggesting that there may be a threshold below
which little effect is observed. The greatest increase observed for
polyA repeats was at the 5’ internal boundary (5-fold difference
between repeats of 3 and 9 bp). In polyC repeats, a slower increase
was observed in 5’ positions, while the internal 3’ boundary position
showed the largest and most rapid increase with a 7-fold difference
between the longest and shortest repeats. At the 5’ internal boundary,
a slight decrease of 9 bp was observed in polyC repeats. As the error
bars for this estimate overlap with those for repeats of 8 bp, this may
be an artifact of the small sample size. However, it may reﬂect a real
Change in the relationship between MNRs and mutation rate at this
length, although caution should still be exercised when extrapolating
this to repeats >9bp.

This is reminiscent of the relationship observed between repeat
length and repeat instability. The rate of slippage during replication,
one of the main causes of length variability, increases with the
length of homopolymeric tracts (Sia et al., 1997; Wierdl et al.,
1997), leading to an increase in repair in these sequences. It may
be hypothesized, that similar processes to those inﬂuencing MNR
length variation also affect the mutation rate at the boundaries of
these repeats. This observation is independent of the decrease in
mutation rate in regions surrounding long repeats anticipated by
Kruglyak et al. (1998) and noted in previous studies (Santibanez-
Koref et al., 2001) since it pertains to the frequency of SNPs in
the broader sequence context of the repeat, while our observations
concern positions immediately adjacent to the repeat boundary.

To investigate the relationship between length polymorphisms and
the frequency of point mutations at the MNR boundary, we repeated
our analysis using only those repeats showing length variability
according to the dbSNP130 database. We ﬁnd evidence that repeats
showing length variation are enriched for SNPs at the boundary
positions: repeats containing indels represent 0.005% of repeats
but 0.04—0.1% of those with substitutions in boundary positions
(Supplementary Table 3). However, these repeats showed the same
trends in relation to the frequency of mutations in the boundary
positions for A and C repeats as monomorphic repeats. Furthermore,
as these repeats represent such a small fraction of the total dataset
they were not excluded from the analysis.

3.3 Relationship between repeat motif and base change

To investigate whether variants at external positions immediately
adjacent to a repeat showed a tendency to Change to the base of the
nearest mononucleotide tract, we selected SNPs for which ancestral
allele information was known (8.4 million). We included only tracts
of length >5 bp. Compared with the proportion expected if there
was no inﬂuence of the MNR (1 in 3), we observed a signiﬁcant
excess of Changes to the base of the neighboring repeat (Table 1).
While this excess was observed in both polyA and polyC repeats,
it was signiﬁcantly larger in the former (P < 1 X 10T16, X2 test).
Furthermore, there was a 3’ —5’ asymmetry in the extent of this
effect with the 3’ end of the repeat showing a signiﬁcantly higher
proportion of SNPs Changing to the repeat base (P < 1 X 10T16).

This is consistent with the hypothesis that slippage increases the
probability of misincorporation of a base at positions adjacent to
MNRs (Brohede and Ellegren, 1999). Furthermore, it may contribute
to the more rapid decline in repeat frequency with increasing repeat
length and lower average repeat length observed for polyC repeats
compared to polyA repeats, since this would result in a tendency for
polyC repeats to decrease in size, through mutations away from the
repeat motif in the last and ﬁrst repeat base, and to be interrupted by
internal mutations. Conversely, polyA repeats exhibited a greater
internal stability and would be more likely to lengthen through
mutations in the bases adjacent to the MNR.

3.4 Relationship between diversity and repeat
orientation

Finally, we assessed the inﬂuence of the sequence context on
diversity. Findings for trinucleotide repeats have indicated that
stability depends on the orientation of the repeat with respect to
the direction of progress of the replication fork (Freudenreich et al.,
1997). For regions of the genome that are preferentially replicated
in one orientation, this should result in repeats in one orientation
being more stable than those in the opposite orientation, leading
to the Clustering of repeats in the same orientation. Within such
Clusters, repeats in the less common orientation should be less stable.
We therefore investigated whether the frequency of point mutations
at positions adjacent to the MNR boundary was dependent on the
orientation of the nearest repeat with the same motif. In this analysis,
we included only MNRs >5 bp. We found that the orientation of the
nearest repeat and diversity are not independent (Table 2). Compared
with the numbers expected assuming independence, we observed
for both polyA and polyC repeats an excess of mutations in the ﬁrst
external base when the nearest neighbor had the same orientation.
Conversely, there was an excess of mutations in the last base of

a repeat when the nearest neighbor was in the opposite orientation.
Interestingly, in the absence of other factors, such a bias would result
in a tendency of MNRs in a same orientation context to enlarge,
while those that are in regions where MNRs show predominantly
the opposite orientation would tend to contract. This indicates that
our earlier observations regarding the relationship between MNRs
and the frequency of SNPs is correlated with the orientation of
neighboring MNRs, suggesting that, in a certain sequence context,
MNRs in one orientation will be more stable than those in the
opposite orientation.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we have used information from published sources
and extracted from the human reference sequence to show that
there is a signiﬁcant increase in the number of SNPs immediately
adjacent to the boundaries of MNR tracts. SNPs located at these
repeat boundaries account for 2% of all validated SNPs in the
human genome. We have found no evidence to suggest that these
observations are due to sequencing or alignment errors and are,
therefore, conﬁdent that they represent a genuine relationship,
contributing to genetic variability at repeat boundaries.

The inclusion of all MNRs in the human genome means that
this study is the most comprehensive investigation to date of the
distribution of variation surrounding MNRs. Our ﬁndings expand
upon previous discussion of the relationship between microsatellites
and the mutation rate. We have shown that there is a substantial
increase in mutation rate that speciﬁcally affects the bases at the
boundaries of MNRs and that this increase is modulated by repeat
motif, length and orientation with respect to neighboring repeats. We
have further shown a tendency for point mutations at the external
boundary to mutate toward the repeat motif, suggesting that the
incorporation and exclusion of adjacent bases may be a mechanism
by which these repeats expand and contract in the human genome.

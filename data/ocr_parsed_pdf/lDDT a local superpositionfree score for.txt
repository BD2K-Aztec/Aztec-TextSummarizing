ABSTRACT

Motivation: The assessment of protein structure prediction tech-
niques requires objective criteria to measure the similarity between a
computational model and the experimentally determined reference
structure. Conventional similarity measures based on a global super-
position of carbon or atoms are strongly influenced by domain motions
and do not assess the accuracy of local atomic details in the model.
Results: The Local Distance Difference Test (IDDT) is a superposition-
free score that evaluates local distance differences of all atoms in a
model, including validation of stereochemical plausibility. The refer-
ence can be a single structure, or an ensemble of equivalent struc-
tures. We demonstrate that IDDT is well suited to assess local model
quality, even in the presence of domain movements, while maintaining
good correlation with global measures. These properties make IDDT a
robust tool for the automated assessment of structure prediction
servers without manual intervention.

1 INTRODUCTION

The knowledge of a protein’s 3D structure enables a wide spec-
trum of techniques in molecular biology, ranging from rational
design of mutagenesis experiments for the elucidation of a pro-
tein’s function to drug design. While the rapid development of
DNA sequencing techniques has been providing researchers with
a wealth of genomic data, experimental structure determination
techniques require substantially more effort, and consequently
the gap between the number of known protein sequences and
the number of known protein structures has been growing con-
tinuously. To ﬁll this gap, various computational approaches
have been developed to predict a protein’s structure starting
from its amino-acid sequence (Guex et al., 2009; Moult, 2005;
Schwede et al., 2009). Despite remarkable progress in structure
prediction methods, computational models often fall short in

accuracy compared with experimental structures. The biannual
CASP experiment (Critical Assessment of techniques for protein
Structure Prediction) provides an independent blind retrospect-
ive assessment of the performance of different modeling methods
based on the same set of target proteins (Moult et al., 2011).

One of the main challenges for the CASP assessors is to deﬁne
appropriate numerical measures to quantify the accuracy with
which a prediction approximates the experimentally determined
structure. In the course of the CASP experiment, model com-
parison techniques have evolved to reﬂect the current state of the
art of prediction techniques: In the ﬁrst installments of CASP,
root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between a prediction and
the superposed reference structures was used in various forms
as the main evaluation criterion (Hubbard, 1999; Jones and
Kleywegt, 1999; Martin et al., 1997; Mosimann et al., 1995).
However, RMSD has several characteristics that limit its useful-
ness for structure prediction assessment: the score is dominated
by outliers in poorly predicted regions while at the same time it is
insensitive to missing parts of the model, and it strongly depends
on the superposition of the model with the reference structure.

To overcome some of the limitations of RMSD in the context
of CASP, the Global Distance Test (GDT) was introduced in
CASP4 (Zemla, 2003; Zemla et al., 2001). In contrast to RMSD,
the GDT is an agreement-based measure, quantifying the
number of corresponding atoms in the model that can be super-
posed within a set of predefined tolerance thresholds to the ref-
erence structure. For each threshold, different superpositions are
evaluated and the one giving the highest number is selected. The
final GDT score is then calculated as the average fraction of
atoms that can be superposed over a set of predeﬁned thresholds
(0.5, 1, 2 and 4A for GDT-HA and 1, 2, 4 and 8 A for GDT-TS,
respectively). One of the advantages of GDT is that strongly
deviating atoms do not considerably inﬂuence the score. At the
same time, missing segments in the predictions lead to lower
scores. Besides GDT, several other scores for model comparison
have been developed to overcome the limitations of RMSD
(Olechnovic et al., 2013; Siew et al., 2000; Sippl, 2008; Zhang
and Skolnick, 2004).

One of the main limitations of measures based on global
superposition becomes evident when applied to ﬂexible proteins
composed of several domains, which can change their relative
orientation naturally with respect to each other (Fig. 1).
Typically in those cases, the global rigid-body superposition is
dominated by the largest domain, and as a consequence, the
smaller domains are not correctly matched, resulting in artiﬁ-
cially unfavorable scores. In CASP, the effects of domain

IDDT: a local superposition-free score for comparing protein structures and models

 

 

Fig. 1. Comparison of predicted protein structure model with its refer-
ence structure for CASP target T0542. The target structure (shown in
gray) consists of two domains. In (A), a predicted model (T8236, in color)
is shown in full length, with the ﬁrst domain superposed to the target. For
graphical illustration, (B) shows the two domains in the prediction sepa-
rated according to CASP AUs and superposed individually to the target
structure. In both panels, the model is colored according to full-length
lDDT scores following a trafﬁc-light-like red-yellow-green gradient, with
red corresponding to low values of the lDDT, green to high values and
yellow to average values. As superposition-free method, lDDT is insensi-
tive to relative domain orientation and correctly identifies segments in the
full-length model deviating from the reference structure

movement are reduced by splitting the target into the so-called
assessment units (AUs), that are evaluated separately. The def-
inition of AUs is carried out by Visual inspection, and is therefore
time-consuming. Furthermore, the criteria used to deﬁne the AU
are often subjective (Clarke, et al., 2007; Kinch et al., 2011).
Grishin et a]. have proposed an approach to numerically support
this decision by analyzing the variability among the predictions
for a speciﬁc target (Kinch et al., 2011).

Local superposition-free measures based on rotation-invariant
properties of a structure are an attractive alternative to overcome
several of the shortcomings outlined before. For example,
dRMSWthe distance-based equivalent of RMSWis used in
chemoinformatics to assess differences in ligand poses in binding
sites (Bordogna et al., 2011). In CASP9, the local Distance
Difference Test (lDDT) score was introduced, assessing how
well local atomic interactions in the reference protein structure
are reproduced in the prediction (Mariani et al., 2011). More
recently, other nonisuperposition-based scores have been pro-
posed, e.g. CAD score based on residueiresidue contact areas
(Olechnovic et al., 2013), measures using residue contact similar-
ity (Rodrigues et al., 2012) or the recall, precision, F—measure
(RPF)/DP score, which was initially developed to evaluate the
quality of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structures (Huang
et al., 2012). Also, the SphereGrinder score (Kryshtafovych
et al., 2013) was used for the assessment of local accuracy of
refinement targets in CASP9 (MacCallum et al., 2011).

Initially, most of the scores used in structure prediction assess-
ment aimed at the evaluation of the protein backbone or fold,
thereby focusing on carbon a (Cat) atom positions. However,
with increasing accuracy of prediction methods for template-
based models, the focus of the assessment has shifted to the
evaluation of the atomic details of a model. In CASP7, the

ﬁrst scores based on local atomic interactions were introduced
in the form of HBscore, which quantiﬁes the fraction of hydro-
gen bond interactions in the target protein correctly reproduced
in the model (Battey et al., 2007; Kopp et al., 2007). In CASP8,
several scores for assessing the local modeling quality were intro-
duced (main chain reality score, hydrogen bond correctness,
rotamer correctness and side-chain positioning) (Keedy et al.,
2009), as well as an evaluation of the stereochemical realism
and plausibility of models using the MolProbity score (Chen
et al., 2010).

In this article, we expand the initial concept of lDDT. Because
the lDDT score considers all atoms of a prediction including all
side-chain atoms, it is able to capture the accuracy of, e.g. the
local geometry in a binding site, or the correct packing of a
protein’s core. We discuss its properties with respect to its low
sensitivity to domain movements, and the signiﬁcance that can
be assigned to the absolute score values. Furthermore, we intro-
duce the concept of using multiple reference structures simultan-
eously, and incorporate stereochemical quality checks in its
calculation. We finally illustrate how lDDT can be used to high-
light regions of low model quality, even in models of multi-
domain proteins where domain movements are present.

2 METHODS
2.1 The IDDT

lDDT measures how well the environment in a reference structure is
reproduced in a protein model. It is computed over all pairs of atoms
in the reference structure at a distance closer than a predeﬁned threshold
R0 (called inclusion radius), and not belonging to the same residue. These
atom pairs deﬁne a set of local distances L. A distance is considered
preserved in the model M if it is, within a certain tolerance threshold,
the same as the corresponding distance in L. If one or both the atoms
deﬁning a distance in the set are not present in M, the distance is con-
sidered non-preserved. For a given threshold, the fraction of preserved
distances is calculated. The ﬁnal lDDT score is the average of four frac-
tions computed using the thresholds 0.5 A, 1A, 2A and 4A, the same
ones used to compute the GDT-HA score (Battey et al., 2007). For par-
tially symmetric residues, where the naming of chemically equivalent
atoms can be ambiguous (glutamic acid, aspartic acid, valine, tyrosine,
leucine, phenylalaine and arginine), two lDDTs, one for each of the two
possible naming schemes, are computed using all non-ambiguous atoms
in M in the reference. The naming convention giving the higher score in
each case is used for the calculation of the ﬁnal structure-wide lDDT
score.

The lDDT score can be computed using all atoms in the prediction (the
default choice), but also using only distances between Cor atoms, or
between backbone atoms. Interactions between adjacent residues can be
excluded by specifying a minimum sequence separation parameter.
Unless explicitly speciﬁed, the calculation of the lDDT scores for all
experiments described in this article has been performed using default
parameters, i.e. R0 = 15A, using all atoms at zero sequence separation.

2.2 Multireference IDDT

The lDDT can be computed simultaneously against multiple reference
structures of the same protein at the same time. The set of reference
distances L includes all pairs of corresponding atoms, which, in all ref-
erence structures, lie at a distance closer than the reference threshold R0.
For each atom pair, the minimum and the maximum distances observed
across all the reference structures are compared with the distance between
the corresponding atoms in the model M being evaluated. The distance is

considered preserved if it falls within the interval deﬁned by the minimum
and the maximum reference distances or if it lies outside of the interval
by less than the predeﬁned length threshold. The fraction of preserved
distances is computed like in the single reference case.

2.3 Stereochemical quality checks

To account for stereochemical quality and physical plausibility of the
model being evaluated, the calculation of the lDDT can take violations
of structure quality parameters into account. Here, stereochemical viola-
tions in the model are defined as bond lengths and angles with values that
diverge from the respective average reference value derived from high-
resolution experimental structures (Engh and Huber, 1991, 2006) by more
than a predeﬁned number of standard deviations (120 by default; see
Supplementary Material). Interatomic distances between pairs of non-
bonded atoms in the model are considered clashing if the distance
between them is smaller than the sum of their corresponding atomic
van der Waals radii (Allen, 2002), within a predeﬁned tolerance threshold
(by default 1.5A). Tolerance thresholds can be deﬁned for each pair of
atomic elements independently.

In case where the side-chain atoms of a residue show stereochemical
violations or steric clashes, all distances that include any side-chain atom
of this residue are considered as not preserved for the lDDT calculation.
In case the back-bone atoms are involved in stereochemical violations or
steric clashes, all distances that include any atom of the residue are treated
as not preserved.

2.4 Determination of the optimal inclusion radius R0

To determine the optimum value of the inclusion radius parameter R0 for
lDDT, an analysis of predictions of all multidomain targets evaluated
during the CASP9 experiment (Kinch et al., 2011; Mariani et al., 2011)
was carried out (see Supplementary Table SI for a complete list). GDC-
all scores for predictions covering >50% of the target protein sequence
were computed based on the AUs deﬁnitions by the CASP9 assessors
(Kinch et al., 2011). A weighted whole target GDC-all score was com-
puted for each target as the average GDC-all scores of its AUs weighted
by the AU size. GDC-all scores are an all-atom version of GDT with
thresholds from 0.5 to 10 in steps of 0.5 A. GDC-all scores were com-
puted using LGA version 5/2009 (Zemla, 2003), using a 4A cut-off for the
sequence-dependent superposition.

lDDT scores were calculated for the whole targets by including all
residues that are covered by any AU, and in an AU-based form using
the same weighting scheme already applied to GDC-all scores. The
inclusion radius parameter was varied in the range from 2 to 40 A, and
the correlation R2 score between the distribution of weighted averaged
GDC-all scores and the distribution of lDDT scores was computed and
plotted against the value of the inclusion radius (Figs. 2 and 3).

2.5 Validation of baseline scores for different folds

To analyze the inﬂuence of the protein fold of the assessed structure on
the lDDT score, pseudorandom models were created for different archi-
tectures in the CATH Protein Structure Classiﬁcation system (Cuff et al.,
2011) using the following procedure: representative domains longer than
50 residues were selected as evenly as possible among the topologies of the
CATH classiﬁcation. For each domain, side-chain coordinates were
removed and then rebuilt using the SCWRL software package (with de-
fault parameters) (Krivov et al., 2009). Pseudorandom models represent-
ing threading errors were then generated by shifting all residues by one
alignment position in a backbone-only model, and rebuilding the side-
chains with SCWRL4, and computing the corresponding lDDT score.
The procedure was repeated iteratively until a threading error of 50 resi-
due positions was reached. This method is loosely based on the approach
described in Shi et a]. (2009). In Figure 4, we show the results for CATH

For estimating lDDT scores of random protein pairs, 200 protein
models with wrong fold were generated by selecting pairs of structures
with different CATH topologies, generating models by rebuilding side
chains on the backbone of the other protein, and computing lDDT
scores for these decoy models. The median of the resulting distribution
was 0.20, with a 0.04 mean absolute deviation.

2.6 Implementation and availability

lDDT has been implemented using the OpenStructure framework (Biasini
et al., 2010). Source code, standalone binaries for Linux and Mac OSX,
as well as an interactive web server are available at http://swissmodel.

Django and JavaScript jQuery frameworks; it supports all the major

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We have developed the lDDT as a new superposition-free meas-
ure for the evaluation of protein structure models with respect to
a reference structure. In the following, we will discuss the choice
of the optimal inclusion radius parameter R0 to achieve low
sensitivity to domain movements, and analyze baseline scores
for lDDT for different fold architectures. We will discuss the
application of lDDT for assessing local correctness of models,
including stereochemical plausibility. Finally, we will present an
approach for assessing a model simultaneously against several
reference structures, e. g. a structural ensemble from NMR.

3.1 Optimal choice of the inclusion radius parameter R0
makes IDDT largely insensitive to domain movements

3.1.] Determination of the optimal inclusion radius The nature
of the lDDT score is ultimately determined by the choice of the
inclusion radius parameter R0. For low values of the inclusion
radius, only short-range distances are assessed, and the accuracy
of local interactions has a major impact on the ﬁnal value of the
lDDT score. On the other hand, when the value of the inclusion
radius parameter is high, the evaluation of long-range atomic
interactions gains a bigger contribution in the final score, and
the ﬁnal lDDT score turns into a representation of the global
model architecture quality.

For assessing the accuracy of protein models, the inclusion
radius should be high enough to give a realistic assessment of
the overall quality of the model, but at the same time, the lDDT
score should not lose its ability to evaluate the modeling quality
of local environments. Especially, scores should not be inﬂu-
enced by changes of domain orientation between the model
and the target structures. The optimal value of the inclusion
radius parameter R0 has been determined on a dataset compris-
ing all CASP9 predictions for multidomain targets, and the

corresponding assignment of AUs as defined by the CASP9
assessors. Weighted GDC-all scores were calculated as weighted
averages of the AU-based scores (see Materials and Methods for
details). Hence, the weighted GDC-all scores can be considered
to be largely devoid of the inﬂuence of domain movements.
lDDT scores were then computed using both the full target struc-
tures and, in a weight-averaged AU—based form, for a range of
R0, values from 1 to 40 For each threshold, we calculated the
correlation with the weight-averaged GDC-all scores for the
same predictions. We used GDC-all (and not the more
common Cot-based GDT) score to compare two all-atoms meas-
ures on the same set of data. The results are shown in Figure 2.
The conclusions presented in this article, however, also hold
when using GDT as reference measure.

For small values of the R0 parameter, the two types of lDDT
scores essentially reduce to a contact map overlap measure
(V endruscolo et al., 1999) and the correlation with global
scores such as GDC-all is rather low. As the inclusion radius
increases, longer-range interactions are being evaluated and the
correlation shows a steep increase as the lDDT score starts to
reﬂect the global quality of the model. For large values of R0,
where inter-domain relationships start playing a more signiﬁcant
role and domain movements start to inﬂuence the whole-target
lDDT score, its correlation begins to decrease slowly. However,
the slow decrease in correlation for values of the inclusion radius
>24A (Fig. 2) shows the stability of the whole-target lDDT score
with respect to the inﬂuence of domain movements. Even includ-
ing all inter-atomic distances in the calculation (R0 2 00), which
maximizes the effect of domain movement, does not signiﬁcantly
lower the correlation with domain-based GDC-all scores
(R220.82). Based on this analysis, we selected a default value
of 15A for the inclusion radius R0, This allows the lDDT score
to avoid the drawbacks that affect measures based only on very
local characteristics, e. g. contact map overlap.

3. I .2 Sensitivity analysis versus relative domain
movements Proteins consisting of multiple domains can exhibit
ﬂexibility between their domains, which can often be experimen-
tally observed in the form of structures with different relative
orientations of otherwise rigid domains. In many cases, these
relative movements play a functional role. From a modeling
assessment perspective, however, the analysis of the relative
orientation of the domains must therefore be separated from
the assessment of the modeling accuracy of the individual
domains.

The insensitivity to relative domain movement makes the
lDDT score a good choice for the unsupervised evaluation of
predictions of multidomain structures, in contrast to scores
based on global superposition. To illustrate this behavior,
Figure 3 shows lDDT and GDC-all scores computed on full-
length structures as a function of the AU—based weight-averaged
GDC-all scores (x-axis). As expected, the correlation between the
two types of GDC-all scores is rather poor (R220.58), whereas
the correlation between the AU—based GDC-all scores and the
lDDT scores is good (R2: 0.89). The hybrid nature of the lDDT
score allows it to be global enough to evaluate the modeling
quality of the protein domains, but local enough to be only mar-
ginally affected by their relative orientations in the compared
structures. When using the lDDT score to evaluate predictions,

it is not necessary to split the target structure in separate
domains, whose identiﬁcation can be a complex and time-
consuming procedure. The absolute lDDT score values show a
dependency on the structural architecture of the protein being
modeled (see Section 3.2 later in the text). For example, a small
group of predictions off-diagonal (GDC-all between 0.2 and
0.35, lDDT between 0.4 and 0.6) belonging to target T0629
show a high correlation within the group, but the slope is differ-
ent from other targets. The elongated trimeric structure of T0629
has relatively few intra-chain contacts and is mainly stabilized by
interactions between chains. Thus, local interactions within a
chain are mainly limited to trivial nearest neighbor contacts
that are easily satisﬁed in predictions, which explain the higher
lDDT scores. For reference, the correlation between the lDDT
and GDC—all scores for single-domain CASP9 targets is shown in
Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.2 Validation of IDDT score baselines for different
protein folds

Because lDDT scores express the percentage of inter-atomic dis-
tances present in the target structure that are also preserved in
the model, a value of ‘0’ corresponds to 0 conserved distances,
and ‘1’ to a perfect model. However, these extreme values are in
practice rarely observed, even in extremely high and low-quality
models. At the high-accuracy end, ﬂuctuations in surface side
chain conformations will result in values <1. For very low
accuracy models, still some local inter-atomic distances will be
preserved if the model has at least a stereochemically plausible
structure and features some secondary structure elements. In the
context of protein model assessment, two types of baseline values
are of interest: the expected score when comparing two random
structures, and scores for models with correct folds but including
threading errors.

In principle, the ﬁrst value could be estimated using Florye
Huggins polymer solution theory (Flory, 1969; Huggins, 1958),
e.g. as done for the determination of RPF/DP values for NMR
structures (Huang et al., 2012). However, because protein struc-
tures are rich in rigid structural elements like a-helices and
ﬂ-sheets, where the relative local positions are restricted, they
show in general a higher number of preserved local distances
than random polymers. Based on these considerations, we
decided to empirically derive lDDT baseline scores by comparing
a reference structure with a set of well-defined decoy models.
A comparison of the FloryeHuggins and decoy-based analysis
can be found in the Supplementary Materials. The average lDDT
score when comparing random structures, i.e. protein models
with different architectures (see Materials and Methods), is
0.20 (:l:0.04). For estimating the effect of alignment shifts in
models with otherwise correct fold and stereochemistry, we cre-
ated pseudomodels starting from the original protein structure
and introducing threading errors of increasing magnitude for
different representative structure architectures from CATH
(Cuff et al., 2011). We then compared the pseudomodels with
the original structure, computing their lDDT scores against it.

Here, we show the results for CATH architecture entries 1.25
(Alpha Horseshoe) as example for proteins rich in ai-helices, and
2.40 (Beta-barrel) as representative for a ﬂ-sheet protein (Fig. 4).
The plots at the top of each panel show the value of the lDDT

scores (on the y-axis) for 60 pseudomodels as a function of the
magnitude of the threading error (residue offset) on the x-axis.
For large threading errors, the lDDT scores converge to a ‘base—
line’ range of scores, which appear to be largely independent of
the threading error magnitude. We considered scores in this
range to be typical lDDT scores for a low-quality model with
the same architecture as the target structure. For models in the
Alpha Horseshoe architecture, the average baseline lDDT score
is ~0.28, whereas for the Beta barrel class, the value of 0.22 is
lower, illustrating the inﬂuence of the architecture of the protein.
This indicates that the lower boundary of the lDDT score can
vary as a function of the architecture of the target protein, which
inﬂuences the comparison of absolute raw scores of models for
different folds, but not of models of the same architecture. This is
a common behavior of most structure comparison measures.

One interesting feature in Figure 4 is the presence of several
peaks at larger threading errors (e. g. around residue 34) in the
Alpha Horseshoe architecture example. These peaks correspond
to internal repeats in the structure, which give rise to locally
correct models when the threading shift coincides with the size
of the repeat.

3.3 Local model accuracy assessment

Modeling errors are typically not homogenously distributed over
the model, but are localized, e. g. in template-based models often
in segments that had to be remodeled de novo. Residue-based
lDDT scores quantify the model quality on the level of a residue’s
environment. The low sensitivity of lDDT to relative domain
movements also applies to per-residue scores. As shown in
Figure 1, local lDDT scores are not dominated by different
domain orientations between the target and the model structures,
but correctly reﬂect the accuracy of the local atomic environment
surrounding the residue under investigation in the model.
Figure 1 shows a superposition of the structure of target T0542
(in light gray) with prediction by group TS236 (colored according
to the full-length lDDT score). The models represent each of the
two individual domains with high accuracy, but their relative
domain orientation does not correspond to the target structure.
Superposition-based scores would assign a high score to one of
the domains but not to the other, or require scoring based on
isolated domain. As illustrated on the right panel (Fig. 1), resi-
dues with low lDDT score correspond to regions of large local
structural divergence between the two domain structures, irre-
spective of the domain movement between them. As expected,
low local scores can also be detected at the interface between the
two domains where the interactions cannot be modeled correctly
without knowing their relative orientation in the target.

3.4 Stereochemical realism assessment

Although validation of the stereochemical plausibility of protein
models is a routine procedure for experimental structure deter-
mination, e.g. in X-ray crystallography (Read et al., 2011), this is
not a common practice in theoretical modeling. Depending on
the applied method, models generated in silico may reveal rather
unrealistic stereochemical properties. Typically, numerical scores
applied in retrospective model assessment compute a measure for
the average atomic dislocation between the reference structure
and the model, without considering the stereochemical quality of

IDDT: a local superposition-free score for comparing protein structures and models

 

the latter. Consequently, two models with similar average atomic
displacements may nevertheless differ signiﬁcantly in their
stereochemical plausibility, and some models might include
atomic arrangements that are physically impossible.

To address this question, lDDT incorporates a stereochemical
plausibility check, which assesses two aspects of model quality:
the lengths of chemical bonds and the widths of angles in the
model structure. Bond and angle measurements are compared
with a set of standard parameters derived from high-resolution
crystal structures (Engh and Huber, 2006). A stereochemical Vio-
lation is deﬁned as a parameter deviating from the expected
values by more than a speciﬁed number of standard deviations
(default: 120; see Supplementary Material). Inter-atomic dis-
tances between non-bonded atoms in the model are compared
with the sum of their Van der Waals radii (Allen, 2002), and a
Violation (‘clash’) is assigned if two atoms are closer than the sum
of the Van der Waals radii, allowing a certain tolerance (default:
1.5 A). When calculating the lDDT score, all distances involving
side-chain atoms of a residue involved in any type of stereochem-
ical Violations in the model are considered as non-preserved.
In cases where backbone atoms are involved in stereochemical
Violations, all distances involving this residue are considered non-
preserved. This approach leads to the lowering of the final lDDT
score of a model according to the extent of the structure’s
stereochemical problems (Fig. 5).

As an example, Figure 5 shows the CASP9 prediction TS276_1
for target T0570—D1. The backbone of the prediction can be
superposed accurately to the backbone of the target structure
(left panel), and the prediction has indeed a high GDT-HA
score (0.814). Displacement-based all-atom scores do not imme-
diately reveal the problems, with a GDC-all score of 0.705 and
an lDDT score without stereochemical checks of 0.682.
However, when the lDDT score includes stereochemical check,
the lDDT score drops to 0.571. Panel B shows a close-up of the
region around residue alanine 21, where several stereochemical
Violations are evident.

3.5 Multireference structure comparison

The typical situation for protein structure prediction assessment
is to compare a model against a single reference structure. There

stereochemical quality checks on lDDT score for a model (TS276, left
side as ribbon representation) for target T0570-D1 with unrealistic stereo-
chemistry (close-up, right). Residues with too short (1) or too long (2)
chemical bonds, as well as those with close atomic interactions (3) or
impossible bond angles (4), result in lower scores during the lDDT
computation

are, however, cases where several equivalent reference structures
are available, e. g. structural ensembles generated by NMR, crys-
tal structures with multiple copies of the protein in the asymmet-
ric unit (non-crystallographic symmetry) (e.g. target T603 in
CASP9), or independently determined X-ray structures for the
same protein at different experimental conditions. In these cases,
no structure can be considered more reliable than any other.
However, owing to the choice of different templates, models
often have a higher similarity to one or the other reference struc-
ture, and the choice of reference for the evaluation score can lead
to very different results for models of equal quality.

In case of the lDDT, the following approach allows to evalu-
ate a model simultaneously against an ensemble of reference
structures: for each pair of atoms, we deﬁne an acceptable dis-
tance range by taking the minimal and maximal distance
observed across all references where the atoms are present. If,
in any of the reference structures, the distance is longer than the
inclusion radius R0, this distance is considered a long-range
interaction, and is ignored. For the assessment, the correspond-
ing distance in the model is considered preserved, when it falls
inside the acceptable range or outside of it by less than a prede-
ﬁned threshold offset.

One obvious application of the multi-reference lDDT score is
the evaluation of models against NMR structure ensembles. For
example, in the case of CASP9 target T0559 (PDBID: 2L01), an
ensemble of 20 NMR structures has been experimentally deter-
mined. Selecting one single chain from the ensemble as reference
to evaluate prediction models would be an arbitrary decision,
artiﬁcially favoring some models that are closer to that speciﬁc
structure. To estimate the effect of selecting a single reference
structure, all structures in the ensemble were in turn used as a
‘model’ and evaluated against all the others. Using traditional
pairwise comparison with GDC-all scores (Fig. 6, striped bars),
ﬂuctuations of almost 12 GDC points around an overall low

value of 0.77 are observed. To avoid this, variable regions of the
ensemble are often excluded from the assessment (Clarke et al.,
2007; Kinch et al., 2011; Mao et al., 2011).

Ideally, this situation should be avoided, and a prediction
should not be rewarded or penalized for being more similar to
one member of the ensemble than to another. The multireference
version of the lDDT score has been developed to overcome this
problem by sampling the conformational space covered by the
ensemble and compensating for its variability. Using the same
example, the multireference lDDT score, which uses one chain as
a ‘model’ and all the others together as multireferences, shows a
spread of <1% (Fig. 6, dotted bars), indicating its robustness
when scoring a model against an ensemble of equivalent reference
structures. Recently, methods using elastic network models have
been proposed to computationally explore the intrinsic ﬂexibility
landscape for a single reference protein (Perez et al., 2012).

4 CONCLUSION

In this article, we describe the lDDT score, which combines
an agreement-based model quality measure with (optional)
stereochemical plausibility checks. We have demonstrated its low
sensitivity with respect to domain movements in case of multido-
main target proteins, which allows for automated assessment with-
out the need for manually splitting targets into AUs. We also have
shown that local atomic interactions are well captured and local
lDDT scores faithfully reﬂect the modeling quality of sub-regions
of the prediction. In addition, we present an approach to compare
models against multiple reference structures simultaneously with-
out arbitrarily selecting one reference structure for the target, or
removing parts that show variability. Additionally, as an agree-
ment-based score, lDDT is robust with respect to outliers.

One disadvantage of the lDDT score is that it does not fulﬁll
the mathematical criteria to be a metric. However, the same is
true for most scores commonly applied for structure comparison
such as GDT, or RSMD based on iterative superposition when
comparing models with different number of atoms. We consider
lDDT particularly suited for the evaluation of predictions for the
same target protein, e. g. in the context of the CASP and
CAMEO (www.cameo3d.org) experiments. For these kind of
applications, unlike, e. g. for clustering protein structures, we
do not see the lack of metric properties as a signiﬁcant limitation.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The R package displayHTS implements recently developed
methods and figures for displaying data and hit selection results in
high-throughput screening (HTS) experiments. It generates not only
certain useful distinctive graphics such as the plate-well series plot,
plate image and dual-flashlight plot but also other commonly used
figures such as volcano plot and plate correlation plot. These figures
are critical for visualizing the data and displaying important features of
HTS data and hit selection results.

Availability and implementation: The package is freely available from
CRAN: http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.htm|, being distributed under

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput screening (HTS) technologies play a critical
role in modern biological research and drug discovery (Brass
et al., 2008). One of the major advantages of HTS technologies
is their ability to simultaneously interrogate thousands of genes/
compounds per experiment. To glean biological information
from large volumes of HTS data, the first step in data analysis
is to use speciﬁc graphics to Visualize and display important fea-
tures of data. Data display allows the identiﬁcation of potential
problems such as systematic spatial effects, pin issues, assay qual-
ity issues and so forth, as they occur (Qu, 2010; Zhang, 2008).
The methods and ﬁgures of displaying data in HTS experiments
have been described to disclose various patterns of spatial effects
and assay quality issues in the literature (Gunter et al., 2003;
Zhang, 2011). Speciﬁc figures such as dual-ﬂashlight plot have
also been explored previously (Zhang, 2010, 2011). However,
there is a lack of an analytic tool to implement all those methods
and figures. To serve this need, here we develop an R package
displayH TS to display data and results from HTS experiments.

The R package can generate not only plate-based images but
also differential abundance/enrichment plots. Speciﬁcally, it can
generate useful distinctive graphics such as (i) the plate-well series
plot that can display data well by well and plate by plate in an
experiment (Zhang et al., 2006), (ii) the plate image that

incorporates box-plot statistics and reveals positions and pat-
terns of selected hits (Zhang, 2008; Zhang et al., 2008) and (iii)
the dual-ﬂashlight plot that shows both average fold change and
effect size reﬂected by strictly standardized mean difference
(SSMD) (Zhang, 2010). displayHTS can also generate other
plots such as the volcano plot and plate correlation plot.

2 THE PACKAGE AND ITS USAGE

2.1 Description of package displayHT S

The R package displayHTS has four main functions:
plateWellSeriesfn, imagedesignfn, imagejntensityfn and
dualFlashIightfn. plateWeIlSeriesfn generates a scatter plot
based on the measured or calculated values of each well in
every plate in an HTS experiment. imagedesignfn displays a
plate design that can be used to Visualize the arrangement of
controls and samples in a plate. imagejntensityfn creates an
image plot that shows the intensities or calculated values of
every well using the box-plot statistics and allows for easy ana-
lysis of any systematic measurement errors. Finally,
duaIFlashlightfn generates the dual-ﬂashlight plot, volcano plot
and plate correlation plot. This package also includes three ex-
ample datasets: H TSdata, H TSdataSort and HTSresults.
H TSdata contains the raw data; after sorting and removing re-
dundant records, the data are stored in H TSdataSort; finally, the
data are processed and the SSMD, mean, P-Value and number of
replicates of the data are contained in H TSresults. See
Supplementary Materials and the help ﬁles of the packages for
how to download the package and to use the functions.

2.2 Plate-well series plot

In a typical HTS experiment, there are tens to hundreds of plates
each with 96, 384 or 1536 wells. It is important to display the
measured or calculated values well by well and plate by plate in
an experiment so that the existing position pattern both in each
plate and across plates can be revealed. A scatter plot called a
‘plate-well series plot’ (Zhang et al., 2006; Zhang, 2011) has been
designed to serve this purpose.

In a plate-well series plot, the value of the x-axis is the index of
the position of a well in a plate, whereas the labels in the x-axis
are the plate numbers, instead of the index of the position of a
well. The positions of wells in a plate can be indexed by either the
rows or columns in a plate. The y-axis denotes the intensity either
in the original scale, a transformed scale such as log-transformed,
or a calculated value such as fold change, percent inhibition,

z—score or SSMD. We may use different colours or point types to
display the values of various control wells if there are controls in
the experiments.

The function plateWellSeriesfn in the package can draw a
plate-well series plot for all or part of the plates in an HTS
experiment (Fig. 1A). The plate-well series plot can also display
hit selection results in a screen as shown in the help ﬁle of
plateWellSeriesfn.

The advantage of a plate-well series plot is that it can effect-
ively display plate-to-plate variability, show selected hits for all
plates and present common data features of multiple plates in a
single plot. See Zhang (2011) for examples.

2.3 Plate design image

For both quality control and hit selection, it is important to
display where the controls and samples are arranged in a plate,
which is achieved by the plate design image. In a plate design
image plot, the design of well types in a plate can be displayed by
using different colours. The image of well-type design can show
the positions of each type of wells including different control and
sample wells. This information is helpful for revealing outliers,
systematic errors and assay quality (Zhang, 2008, 2011). The
function imagedesignfn can display the design of well types in
a plate of an HTS experiment. In addition, it can display hit
selection results in a screen as shown in the example of its help
ﬁle (Fig. 1B).

2.4 Plate intensity image

Although presenting common data features of multiple plates in
a single plot, the well-series plot cannot display the positional
effects in an individual plate as straightforwardly as the plate
intensity plots. Thus, in many cases, it is helpful to display the
data and/or results in each individual plate so that the positional
effects and other potential systematic errors such as pin effect can
be revealed.

(E) Volcano plot in the example dataset

A plate intensity image is built by incorporating box-plot stat-
istics into a regular image plot (Zhang et al., 2008; Zhang, 2011).
That is, we first use the box-plot technique to find the lower and
upper whiskers. The strongest green represents the lower whisker
(instead of the minimal value in the regular image plot) and the
strongest red represents the upper whisker (instead of the max-
imal value in the regular image plot). A green ‘7’ in a white well
indicates that the value in that well is an outlier in the lower end,
and a red ‘+’ in a white well indicates that the value in that well is
an outlier in the upper end. The values in the legend are those
between the upper and lower whiskers (Fig. 1C). The plate in-
tensity image can check the data plate by plate without the
masking effect of outliers. The function imagejntensityfn can
generate the plate intensity image.

2.5 Dual-ﬂashlight, correlation and volcano plots

The results for hit selection for each siRNA or compound are
usually shown by SSMD, z-score and/or P—Value. Those results
for all siRNAs or compounds can be displayed by using
dual-ﬂashlight or volcano plots.

SSMD is the average fold change (in log scale) penalized by
the variability of fold change (in log scale) (Zhang, 2007a).
SSMD can overcome the drawback of average fold change not
being able to capture data variability and has a probability-based
classifying rule (Zhang, 2007b, 2011). The dual-ﬂashlight plot
displays average fold change and SSMD with lines drawn that
represent the thresholds in the SSMD-based classifying criteria
(Fig. 1D) (Zhang 2010; Zhang et al., 2011). The dual-ﬂashlight
plot can be drawn using function dualFlashZightfn in our pack-
age. This function can also be used to generate (i) volcano plot,
which displays both average fold change and P-Value (Fig. 1E),
which may be generated by using existing R packages like
‘edgeR’ (Robinson et al., 2010), and (ii) plate correlation plot,
which is commonly used to check for reproducibility among rep-
licate plates. See the help file of ‘dualFlashlight.fn’ for example
codes.

3 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The R package displayHTS provides an analytic tool that can
generate figures for displaying data and hit selection results from
HTS experiments. This package can be used to generate not only
useful distinctive graphics including the plate-well series plot,
plate image and dual-ﬂashlight plot but also other commonly
used ﬁgures such as volcano plot and plate correlation plot.
The Visualization of data and hit selection results enabled by
displayH TS is critical to reveal various patterns of spatial effects
and assay quality issues in HTS experiments for both small
molecules and siRNAs.

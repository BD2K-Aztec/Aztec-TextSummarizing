Abstract

Motivation: The inherent promiscuity of small molecules towards protein targets impedes our
understanding of healthy versus diseased metabolism. This promiscuity also poses a challenge for
the pharmaceutical industry as identifying all protein targets is important to assess (side) effects
and repositioning opportunities for a drug.

Results: Here, we present a novel integrated structure— and system—based approach of drug—target
prediction (iDTP) to enable the large—scale discovery of new targets for small molecules, such as
pharmaceutical drugs, co—factors and metabolites (collectively called 'drugs’). For a given drug, our
method uses sequence order—independent structure alignment, hierarchical clustering and prob—
abilistic sequence similarity to construct a probabilistic pocket ensemble (PPE) that captures pro—
miscuous structural features of different binding sites on known targets. A drug’s PPE is combined
with an approximation of its delivery profile to reduce false positives. In our cross—validation study,
we use iDTP to predict the known targets of 11 drugs, with 63% sensitivity and 81% specificity. We
then predicted novel targets for these drugs—two that are of high pharmacological interest, the
peroxisome proliferator—activated receptor gamma and the oncogene B—cell lymphoma 2, were
successfully validated through in vitro binding experiments. Our method is broadly applicable for
the prediction of protein—small molecule interactions with several novel applications to biological
research and drug development.

1 IntrOdUCtlon industry, predicting and minimizing off—target effects is important

Most metabolites and pharmaceutical drugs bind to more than one because they are the source of low efficacy and high toxicity that re—
protein (Reddy and Zhang, 2013), resulting in a phenotype com— sult in a high failure rate of new drugs in clinical trials (Arrowsmith,
posed of many molecular (side) effects. For the pharmaceutical 201la,b; Liebler and Guengerich, 2005). Recent studies estimate

that each drug on average binds to at least six known and several
unknown targets (Lounkine et (11., 2012; Mestres et (11., 2009). Thus,
knowledge of off—target effects can help reduce drug resistance and
provide opportunities for multi—target drug development (Peters,
2013). Moreover, off—target ligands for a given drug may inspire
‘drug repositioning’, where a drug already approved for one condi—
tion is redirected to treat another condition, thereby overcoming
delays and costs associated with clinical trials and drug approval
(Ashburn and Thor, 2004). Therefore, predicting off—target binding
sites to comprehensively understand the side effects of drugs and
exploit drug repositioning opportunities is central for rapid, cost—
efficient drug development.

In addition to drug development, identifying all cellular targets
of a given biological cofactor, metabolite or other small molecules is
of great importance for understanding cellular function and dysfunc—
tion in general (e.g. metabolome—target interactions and associated
diseases) (Alam et (11., 2014). Finally, identifying possible targets of
environmental pollutants may help us to understand and avoid
health hazards from released chemicals.

Computational methods to predict new targets for existing en—
dogenous or administered small—molecule compounds are, therefore,
of high biological and pharmacological value. (For simplicity, we
herein refer to all these compounds collectively as ‘drugs’, meaning
‘a small—molecule chemical substance with effects on a biological
system’.) These methods can be divided into three broad categories:
structure based, expression based and ligand based. Structure—based
methods utilize information from drug targets by employing binding
site similarity or molecular docking (Chang et (11., 2010; Engin et (11.,
2012; Kinnings et (11., 2009; Li et (11., 2011); expression—based meth—
ods exploit molecular activity perturbation signatures that result
from drug activity (Chen et (11., 2009; Emig et (11., 2013; Hu and
Agarwal, 2009; Iorio et (11., 2010; Lamb et (11., 2006; Suthram et (11.,
2010; Wei et (11., 2006); and ligand—based methods utilize the chem—
ical and structural properties of a drug to discover new targets
(Keiser et (11., 2009; Noeske et (11., 2006; Qu et (11., 2009). In add—
ition to these methods, previously unknown targets for existing
drugs have also been predicted using side effect similarity
(Campillos et (11., 2008), genome—wide association studies (Sanseau
et (11., 2012) and medical genetics (Wang and Zhang, 2013).
Recently, methods that combine information from multiple sources
have been introduced and will likely become the preferred approach
(Napolitano et (11., 2013); however, because most of these methods
were not benchmarked on drugs with known targets (sensitivity ana—
lysis), it is difficult to evaluate their success rate. To date, the only
studies to report a true positive prediction rate have done so at rela—
tively low rates (29% and 49%, respectively) (Chang et (11., 2010; Li
et (11., 2011). Moreover, a high—throughput framework based on
structural information remains unavailable, and current methods do
not satisfactorily capture the structural ﬂexibility of drugs that can
adopt several conformations, allowing them to interact differently
with different targets.

In this study, we propose a novel computational drug target pre—
diction method that integrates structural signatures of small—mol—
ecule compounds with their tissue delivery profiles. iDTP
incorporates four major developments: (i) Unlike previous methods,
this framework is generic and does not target a specific drug. (ii)
iDTP uses the probabilistic pocket ensemble (PPE) to capture the
promiscuous nature of different binding pockets for the same drug.
(iii) iDTP uses the approximated drug delivery profile (aDDP) of the
respective drug to predict biologically relevant targets. The drug
delivery profile (DDP) is defined as the distribution of drug concen—
trations in different tissues after circulation. Since such information

is not directly available, we approximated the DDP, denoted as
aDDP, as the average of the mRNA expression of the known drug
targets in 79 human tissues. Thus, an aDDP is a vector of length 79.
(iv) iDTP has a performance guarantee supported by (i) cross valid—
ation on a benchmark dataset; (ii) in vitro binding experiments; and
(iii) large—scale text mining. Application of iDTP allowed us to pro—
pose a novel cellular target for coenzyme A (CoA), a novel drug—
gable pocket and lead compound for Bcl—2, and plausible
mechanistic information for the inhibition of CYP2E1 by Trolox.

2 Methods

2.1 Dataset

We extracted the approved/experimental drugs from the DrugBank
database (version 3) (Knox et (11., 2011). Eleven drugs selected for
use in this study had at least one 3D structure of a drug—protein
complex and more than 40 known drug targets with solved apo
structures (Supplementary Table S1). During the in silico valid—
ation of our method, a 5—fold cross—validation is done on the
known targets of each drug to evaluate how well our method can
recover the known targets. For example, for a drug with 40 known
targets, only 32 structures are used to construct the PPE for each
fold. When our method is used to predict new targets, all the
known targets are used to construct the PPE for a drug. Therefore,
in this study, our dataset contains drugs with 40 or more known
targets because our experiments involve 5—fold cross—validation. In
practical use of our method, 30 known targets are sufficient. We
expect this number to be further reduced in the future. We expect
that our method is also suitable for much larger sets of drugs estab—
lished for proprietary research that are not detailed in public
databases.

Protein structures have more than 30 pockets on average (some
structures have >100 pockets), and a majority of the small—mol—
ecule protein interactions occur in the three largest pockets (Huang
and Schroeder, 2006). A typical pocket involved in small—molecule
protein interactions (also known as a druggable pocket) has char—
acteristic values for pocket solvent accessible surface area (300—
600 A2) and pocket volume (400—600 A3) (Gao and Skolnick,
2013; Perot et (11., 2010). We hypothesize that a protein structure
that has a minimal (i.e. less than three) number of pockets and no
druggable pocket is unlikely to interact with a drug. To form the
negative dataset, we extracted the protein structures with fewer
than three pockets from the CASTp database (Dundas et (11.,
2006). We extracted the surface residues (>70% of the solvent—ac—
cessible surface area) of these protein structures using POPS after
redundancy reduction using the PISCES webserver (<60% pair—
wise sequence identity) (Cavallo et (11., 2003; Wang and Dunbrack,
2003). We further removed the NMR structures, the structures
With cocrystallized DNA, RNA or ligands (excluding ions like
Zn2+, Cl’), and the structures with druggable pockets. Our nega—
tive dataset contained a total of 63 protein structures (a detailed
list of PDB IDs can be found in the Supplementary file NEG data—
set). Note that our negative dataset thus can still contain protein
structures with less than three pockets. However, if they do so,
none of the pockets can be druggable. The surface residues of the
structures in the negative dataset were aligned with the PPEs of all
drugs in the dataset by CPalign (Dundas et (11., 2007). The align—
ments were then scored by the scoring function defined in Section
2.3. Ideally, each of these alignments should have a bad (i.e. high)
score, so it will not be predicted to be a drug target. Otherwise, it
is counted as a false—positive prediction when we evaluate the spe—
cificity of our method (see Section 3.2).

2.2 Constructing a PPE

The overview flowchart of our method is shown in Supplementary
Figure S1. After identifying the drug—target complex for each drug
in the dataset, we extracted the pocket that the drug binds to in the
protein structure using the CASTp webserver (Dundas et al., 2006),
which we refer to as the ‘bound pocket’. To identify the drug—bind—
ing site in apo structures of known drug targets, we extracted the
three largest pockets from the first chain of their respective 3D struc—
tures. We used sequence order—independent alignment to choose the
pocket most similar to the bound pocket (Cui et al., 2015; Dundas
et al., 2011). Dundas et al. (2011) established a method to construct
the structural signatures for enzyme binding pockets that require
high—quality, manually curated enzyme binding sites and is, there—
fore, not suitable for high—throughput studies. However, we reduced
this requirement by using just one manually curated pocket (except
for nicotinamide—adenine—dinucleotide where we used both bound
structures that are available) and predicting the binding pockets on
the rest of the targets from their apo (unbound) structures to con—
struct the PPE for each drug. Conversely, Dundas et al. manually
searched the literature to find residues that are important for the
interaction and mapped them back onto the apo structures. The PPE
represents a unified set of individual pockets that potentially bind to
several conformations of the drug.

Extraction of the common structural features from the set of
binding pockets is ideally performed using a multiple structure align—
ment method. However, because no such method currently exists
that can handle our dataset, we followed Dundas et al. (2011) by
first using pairwise sequence order—independent structure alignment
of surface pockets and then using hierarchical clustering based on
the pairwise similarities. Dundas et al. constructed several structural
signatures corresponding to the different ligand/ligand binding site
conformations at a predefined specific level of the hierarchical tree.
In most cases, identifying this cutoff is nontrivial and requires in—
depth knowledge about the different conformations of the ligand/
ligand binding site. In contrast, we constructed the structural signa—
ture at the root of the tree. The hierarchical tree is used as a guide to
recursively combine sibling pockets along the paths from leaf nodes
to the root. A signature pocket is computed as the average of two
child (signature) pockets, and the two original child nodes are
replaced with a new single leaf node on the hierarchical tree.

As a result, the structural signature is an ensemble of more than
one unique pocket (corresponding to distinct branches in the hierarch—
ical tree). Each position in the PPE has a preservation ratio (how often
that particular atom was present in the underlying set of pockets)
(Dundas et al., 2011) of at least 0.5 (each atom was present in at least
half of the structures that have an atom present after alignment at this
position). To achieve a minimalistic ensemble and reduce the compu—
tational time, we increased the preservation ratio cutoff to 0.6 if the
number of atoms in the PPE was greater than 110. For specific drugs,
a stricter conservation ratio of atoms essential for binding action of
the respective drugs can be readily incorporated in our method.

2.3 Calculating distance to the PPE

Each position in the structural signature may be occupied by more
than one type of atom (which can be from different residues).
Therefore, we formulated a probabilistic distance function to ac—
commodate this property. The distance function of a query protein
to the already constructed PPE has both structural and sequence
components. The structural component follows Dundas et al.’s ap—

proach, while the sequence component is based on maximum
likelihood.

Score : Structural score + or * Sequence score

Structural score : RMSD *N(’m)

Sequence score : 1 — (Sequence similarity/Best sequence similarity)
Sequence similarity : 2,- (AtomFreq, + ResFreqi)

Best sequence similarity : 2,- (MaxAtomFreq, + MaxResFreqi),

where the value for u is set to 1.2 following Dundas et al. (2011),
RMSD is the root mean square distance after the alignment, N is the
number of positions aligned, AtomFreqi/ResFreqi is the frequency of
aligned atom/residue at position i, MaxAtomFreqi/MaxResFreq is
the highest frequency of any atom/residue at position i, and their
summation is over all the aligned positions. An empirical distance
cutoff of 0.85 that maps to an RMSD of 0.7A and pocket sequence
similarity of 60% for a sequence order—independent alignment of
12—15 atoms is used in this study. An alignment should also contain
at least five atoms.

2.4 Integrating aDDP

We included an approximation for the DDP as an orthogonal source
of structure—independent information. The aDDP for each drug is
calculated by averaging the mRNA expression of known drug tar—
gets over 79 human tissues from Su et al. (2004). We mapped each
drug—target structure to a gene using Uniprot ID mapping service
(Wu et al., 2006); the gene was then searched in the tissue expres—
sion dataset compiled by Su et al. (2004). Because a protein struc—
ture could be mapped to more than one gene, the average expression
of all the mapped genes was used. We classified expression in 79
human tissues into three classes (low, medium and high) based on
empirical cutoffs for mRNA expression (<300, <1000 and 21000,
respectively). The new drug target list is reordered by including the
drug—target tissue expression term in the distance function as
follows:

Score : Structural similarity + u * (1 — Sequence similarity) + [3 ”
Tissue expression

Tissue expressionzl — (Number of tissue wit/7 matching expres-
sion/Total number of tissues),

where l)’ is empirically set to 0.4. If a gene is not present in the data—
set compiled by Su et al., we set (ll’iTissue expression) to 0.2. Our
method is not sensitive to the specific value of l)’ in the range of 0.3—
0.5. [3 plays an important role in differentiating true targets from the
false targets and the most promising targets from less promising
ones. However, it usually does not play an important role in ranking
the top 10 targets as the top 10 predicted targets have an almost per—
fect match between their mRNA expression profile and that of the
estimated DDP.

2.5 In vitro experimental setup

Detailed sections on protein expression and purification; ligands
and peptides; differential scanning ﬂuorimetry; differential static
light scattering; ﬂuorescence anisotropy (FA) measurements; and in—
trinsic tryptophan ﬂuorescence quenching binding assay can be
found in the Supplementary information.

3 Results

3.1 Probabilistic pocket ensemble

An inherently promiscuous drug can bind to different protein pock—
ets that have a range of features, making it difficult to establish a
general description of a drug’s possible binding sites. To capture the
essential binding site features of a promiscuous drug, we developed

a method to construct its PPE (see Section 2 for details). The PPE
represents a unified set of individual pockets that potentially bind to
several conformations of the drug. Each position in the PPE can con—
sist of a number of atoms from different residues. The frequency of
the atoms and residues at each position is recorded and used to con—
struct a maximum likelihood sequence similarity scoring function.
This probabilistic scoring method adequately accounts for the fact
that a drug can bind several pockets and a pocket can bind
several drugs (Gao and Skolnick, 2013). The PPEs of formic acid,
[l—D—glucose and phosphoaminophosphonic acid—adenylate ester are
shown in Figure 1; each position in the PPE is labeled with the atom
of highest frequency.

3.2 Evaluation of the PPE and the probabilistic
scoring function
To investigate the capacity of PPE to retrieve structurally similar
drug—binding pockets, we compared the protein pocket bound by
2’ —monophosphadenosine 5’—diphosphoribose with the predicted
binding pockets of the top 10 predicted targets of this compound
using sequence order—independent and sequence order—dependent
alignments (see Supplementary Section S1). Our results suggest
that a combination of the minimalistic PPE and sequence order—
independent alignment is more powerful in identifying new drug tar—
gets than the combination of the complete binding pocket with
sequence order—dependent structure alignment. Moreover, we
showed that the probabilistic similarity function performs better
than the deterministic similarity function used by Dundas et al.
(2011) (see Supplementary Section S1). The PPE is able to extract
non—trivial sequence and structure signatures that are necessary for
capturing the promiscuous process of a drug binding to multiple
sites and the sites binding to multiple drugs. Most of the predicted
targets spatially align with distinct parts of a respective drug’s PPE
(Supplementary Figure S2), suggesting that the PPE is indeed an en—
semble of several pockets and, therefore, can accommodate different
conformations of each drug. In contrast to previous studies (Dundas
et al., 2011; Tseng and Liang, 2006), these results suggest that mul—
tiple structural signatures may not be optimal for capturing different
drug conformations, but instead, this can be achieved by the incorp—
oration of a probabilistic scoring function in structural signatures.
Moreover, our methodology does not require in—depth details about
the number of binding conformations or the number of structural
signatures.

In the next step, we used cross—validation (see Supplementary
section S3 for details) to assess whether the PPE for each drug

captures the essential features for the drug—protein interaction.
We were able to predict the interaction of drugs with known targets
to an average sensitivity of 63% (Supplementary Table S1). We also
constructed a negative dataset (a benchmark dataset is not available
for such studies) to assess the specificity of the methodology.
Construction of such a negative dataset is non—trivial because of the
inherent promiscuity of drug binding sites and incomplete know—
ledge of drug targets (see Section 2 for details). We found the aver—
age specificity of this method to be 81% (Supplementary Table S1).

3.3 Integrating the DDP to reduce false positives

To identify new drug targets, we downloaded the CASTp database
(Dundas et al., 2006), which consists of 75 000 protein structures
and their pockets. We extracted the three largest pockets, reported
to account for more than 80% of a protein’s small—molecular bind—
ing sites (Huang and Schroeder, 2006; Laskowski, 1995; Liang
et al., 1998; Peters et al., 1996), from each of these protein struc—
tures. We aligned the pockets of each protein structure with the PPE
(constructed using all the known drug targets) of each drug in our
dataset using sequence order—independent structure alignment. This
resulted in several thousand hits, a number similar to those of other
drug repositioning studies (Keiser et al., 2009). Although our
method has high specificity for the curated dataset, the false—positive
rate is expected to be higher in a general database search because
our construction of the PPE is minimalistic, and therefore it can
align with several unrelated protein surfaces randomly (Dundas
et al., 2011; Watson et al., 2005).

To reduce the false positive rate of our method, we included an
approximation for the aDDP as an orthogonal source of structure—
independent information. Given that the actual tissue delivery pro—
file for a specific drug is generally not available, we reasoned that
the intracellular delivery profile of this drug has to be compatible
with the mRNA expression profile of its established targets. In other
words a protein can only be a target of a given drug if the drug is de—
livered into (or produced in) the tissues in which the protein is ex—
pressed at significant levels. For each candidate drug, we therefore
approximate its delivery profile by averaging the mRNA expression
profiles of all its known targets in a set of 79 human tissues (Su
et al., 2004). For the drugs tested, the mRNA expression profiles of
the known target proteins are similar for the same drug (e.g. the
Pearson correlation coefficient of aDDP of CoA with its known tar—
gets is 0.56), but are different between different drugs (e.g. the aver—
age Pearson correlation coefficient of aDDP of CoA with the
aDDP’s of the rest of the drugs is 0.44) as shown in Figure 2. The
mRNA expression profiles not only provide information about pro—
tein localization but also provide information about protein—protein
interactions and pathways (Jansen et al., 2002). Thus, the compari—
son of the average tissue expression profile of the established drug
targets with the expression profiles of the predicted target is ex—
pected to reﬂect the likelihood for drug—target interactions in a par—
ticular set of tissues and hence can be used as a proxy for the drug
delivery.

3.4 Validation using in silico experiments

We used text mining to investigate the capacity of an aDDP to pre—
dict drug—target interactions. A cocitation index finds the associ—
ation between two terms (in this case the name of a drug and a gene)
by comparing the number of times the two terms appear in the ab—
stract of studies in the PubMed library when compared with two
random terms (Qiao et al., 2013). We found that, when the aDDP
was combined with the PPE, the number of predictions with a

statistically significant cocitation index was 2— to 4—fold higher than
using aDDP alone (see Supplementary Section S2 and Table S2). The
top 10 predicted targets (<60% sequence similarity with any of the
known drug targets) of [l—D—glucose using the combined approach
aligned extremely well with its PPE (Supplementary Table S3).
Similar results were observed for all the drugs in the dataset (see
Supplementary file PredTargets). Moreover, six of the top ten pre—
dictions for [l—D—glucose and four predictions for CoA have a statis—
tically significant cocitation index (P—value<0.05). We found a
total of 34 predicted targets with cocitation index values of statis—
tical significance (P—value< 0.05) for all the drugs in our dataset.
For the top 10 predicted targets of all the drugs in the dataset, the
range of the average sequence—similarity score between the PPEs and
the predicted pocket on the targets was between 80 and 87%, the
range of the average RMSD between the PPEs and the predicted
pocket on the targets was between 0.62 and 0.66 A, the range of the
average match of mRNA expression profile between 72 and 76 out
of the 79 tissues and the range of the average final score was be—
tween 0.45 and 0.56 (compared to our cutoff value of 0.85 in our
cross—validation study). These results support that the combination
of PPE and aDDP into iDTP allows identifying novel proteins that
have high structural (binding site) and system—level similarity with
known drug targets.

3.5 Validation using in vitro binding experiments

To provide an experimental assessment of the performance of iDTP,
we chose to test the predicted targets for CoA because it has the least
number of known binding proteins in our dataset and hence has the
least well—defined PPE. We used multiple in vitro binding experi—
ments to test binding site and affinity for two top hits from iDTP,
namely the peroxisome proliferator—activated receptor gamma
(PPARy) and B—cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl—2).

PPARy is a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates numerous
biological functions including adipogenesis and cell differentiation.
Its dysregulation is involved in the onset of diabetes and obesity
(Swedenborg et al., 2009). The interaction of the ligand binding do—
main (LBD) of human PPARy (hPPARy—LBD) with CoA is one of
our most promising predictions because this interaction achieved a
high iDTP score and a statistically significant cocitation index
(Supplementary Table S4). The pocket predicted by iDTP to bind

a destabilizing effect (decreased Tm). (b) The predicted CoA binding site over-

CoA overlaps with the known ligand binding site of PPARy. To test
this prediction in vitro, we used differential scanning ﬂuorimetry to
measure the melting temperature (Tm) of hPPARy—LBD in the pres—
ence or absence of CoA or rosiglitazone, an antidiabetic drug known
to act as a ligand of hPPARy—LBD (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table
S5). At a molar excess of seven, rosiglitazone had a protective effect
by raising the Tm of hPPARy—LBD’s by 2°C from that of the apo pro—
tein, while CoA displayed a destabilizing effect, lowering the Tm by
0.8°C from that of the apo protein, suggesting a direct interaction
with hPPARy—LBD. Next, we used ﬂuorescence anisotropy (FA) to
characterize the interaction between hPPARy—LBD and its natural
partner proteins upon binding with CoA. We measured Kd between
hPPARy—LBD and ﬂuorescein—labeled peptides derived from a coac—
tivator protein (PGC1) and two corepressor proteins (NCoR and
SMRT). These experiments were performed in the presence or ab—
sence of increasing molar excess of CoA or the reference hPPARy—
LBD agonist rosiglitazone or antagonist CD5477 (LeMaire et al.,
2009). If an increasing molar excess of the ligand causes the ﬂuores—
cently labeled coactivator/corepressor Kd to increase, we can infer
that ligand binding is taking place because the ligand disturbs
binding to coactivators or corepressors. The nature of the ligand—
hPPARy—LBD interaction can also be inferred: an agonist ligand
enhances binding to a coactivator and decreases binding to a core—
pressor; an inverse agonist causes the opposite effect; and a neutral
antagonist decreases binding for both coactivators and corepressors.
Accordingly, adding a 2—10M excess of the agonist rosiglitazone
hPPARy—LBD raised the affinity of hPPARy—LBD for the coactivator
PGC1 (Figs 4a and b, Supplementary Table S6). Conversely, a 2M
excess of the antagonist CD55 77 lowered the affinity of hPPARy—
LBD for the coactivator PGC1 (Figs 4a and b, Supplementary Table
S6), whereas the addition of 2—10 M excess of CoA lowered the af—
finity of hPPARy—LBD for both coactivator PGC1 (Fig. 4b) and core—
pressors NCoR and SMRT (Figs 4c and d), Supplementary Table
S6). Collectively, our experiments confirm a direct interaction be—
tween CoA and hPPARy—LBD in which CoA behaves as a neutral an—
tagonist. From its potency in competing with known ligands and its
dose—dependent stabilization of hPPARy—LBD, we estimate an ap—
parent Kd of <500 uM.

We also tested direct binding of CoA to recombinant Bcl—2 (see
Supplementary file PredTargets). Bcl—2, the founding member of the
Bcl—2 family of proteins that control cell death, is an important anti—
apoptotic protein and is classified as an oncogene. Using differential
static light scattering, we observed that the aggregation temperature
T2,gg for 0.5 mg/ml apo Bcl—2 was ~5 7°C. Four hundred nanomoles
of the known ligand, Bax—BH3, significantly increased the T2.gg to
67°C, whereas the presence of 1 MM of the scrambled LD4 peptide

(a negative control) did not alter Tagg. Increasing concentrations of
CoA increased To,gg for Bcl—2 up to 62°C, suggesting a direct inter—
action (Figs 5a and b, Supplementary Table S7). By measuring the
quenching of intrinsic tryptophan ﬂuorescence of Bcl—2 in the pres—
ence of increasing CoA concentrations, we established the Kd of the
CoA:Bcl—2 interaction to be 0.38 mM (Figs 5c and d), whereas the
Kd of a the ﬂuorescent—labeled Bax—BH3 peptide was 128 i 21 nM
(Supplementary Fig. 3a). According to iDTP, the CoA binding
pocket is adjacent to the Bax—BH binding site with no notable over—
lap (Supplementary Fig. 3b). In agreement even 4.7 mM CoA did
not reduce the FA of Bax—BH3 (at a concentration of 20 nM,
235 000 times less than CoA), supporting the prediction that the
binding sites of CoA and Bax—BH do not overlap (Supplementary
Fig. 4). Thus, our in vitro binding experiments strongly support our
computational predictions.

4 Discussion

We have developed a computational method to extract implicit
structural signatures of a drug binding site from an ensemble of
structures of proteins to which this drug binds. We showed that
such a PPE, can be built using as few as one structure of a drug—pro—
tein complex and a set of apo structures of other known drug—bind—
ing proteins. The PPE of a given drug is constructed using sequence
order—independent alignments and a probabilistic scoring function,
which allows weakly conserved but significant structural patterns of
the interactions between the drug and its several target proteins to
emerge and be quantified. Thus, our PPE is able to encode features
related to promiscuous target interactions and structural ﬂexibility
of a drug. The validity of 11 PPEs was confirmed by illustrating that
they reliably identify known targets of the respective drugs. We
found that by combining a PPE with an aDDP as an orthogonal
source of structure—independent information, the resulting method,
iDTP, enables large—scale prediction of novel drug targets.

The challenge of identifying new drug—target pairs in silico has
attracted significant interest from the computational community.
However, compared with other algorithms, iDTP includes unprece—
dented features, because no previous studies have combined se—
quence order—independent alignment and probabilistic scoring
function to model the drug—protein interaction, nor have they

employed the aDDP to filter out false positive predictions. Most pre—
vious studies have not assessed the performance of their methodolo—
gies by exploiting known drug targets, as we did here to validate the
success rate of PPE. Because other studies used considerably differ—
ent datasets and their programs are not publicly available, a direct
comparison among methodologies is unfortunately impossible.
However, compared with iDTP, other existing methods including
conventional docking or structure—based virtual screening, share one
or more of the following limitations: (i) they are known to scale
poorly with the size and complexity of drugs and drug binding sites
(Diller and Li, 2003) and (ii) their algorithms do not appropriately
account for the different conformations of both drug and binding
site residues. Our method addresses these concerns by constructing a
structural signature from a set of binding sites, instead of a single
binding site, and by using a probabilistic sequence similarity func—
tion that allows accounting for the different conformations of drugs
and binding site residues. (The improvement expected from this
methodology is analogous to the improvement from a multiple se—
quence alignment compared to a pairwise alignment.) We also incor—
porated the aDDP to identify relevant new targets.

The predictive power of iDTP was supported by both computa—
tional cross—validation and text mining. Additionally, we validated
two of our predicted interactions by in vitro experiments. First, we
showed that CoA bound to hPPARy—LBD with an apparent Kd of
less than 500 nM, displaying characteristics of a neutral antagonist.
CoA is a ubiquitous cofactor that can reach high concentrations in
eukaryotes depending on cell type and subcellular localization
(~0.14, 0.7 and 5mM in animal cytosol, peroxysomes and mito—
chondria, respectively) (Leonardi et al., 2005). It is therefore pos—
sible that this predicted interaction plays a currently unrecognized

biological role in fatty acid signaling and metabolism. iDTP pre—
dicted that the CoA binding site on hPPARy—LBD is the receptor’s
ligand—binding pocket, which also binds rosiglitazone and CD5477.
Indeed, the ligand—binding pocket of hPPARy is one of the largest
among the nuclear receptor protein family (Li et al., 2003), allowing
hPPARy to bind a variety of ligands. Thus, CoA may trigger a con—
formational change that disrupts or unsettles the binding surface of
both coactivators and corepressors, producing the characteristics of
a neutral antagonist. However, we cannot strictly rule out that CoA
binds to the surface where coactivators and corepressors would nor—
mally bind, creating competition for the binding site.

Second, we verified another CoA interaction predicted by iDTP
by showing that CoA binds in vitro to recombinant Bcl—2 with a Kd
of ~35 0 MM. The predicted CoA binding pocket on Bcl—2 is adjacent
to the known binding site for Bax—BH3. Because we showed that
CoA binds Bcl—2 without displacing Bax—BH3, we can indeed infer
non—competitive binding. The predicted binding pocket of CoA is
interesting for drug design purposes, because it is located adjacent to
the well—explored Bax—BH3 binding pocket (Ku et al., 2011); there—
fore, it may provide an alternative target site with possible syner—
getic effects.

Beyond validating our computational predictions, our in vitro
experiments also suggest the usefulness of iDTP for various applica—
tions: The case of the CoA—hPPARy illustrates how iDTP might be
used to reveal biologically relevant interactions between small mol—
ecules (ligands, cofactors or metabolites) and cellular proteins.
Thus, our method could help establish metabolite—protein pairs for
large—scale metabolic analyses or for predicting possible targets for
chemical small—molecule pollutants such as bisphenols. The inter—
action between CoA and Bcl—2 illustrates how iDTP could be used
for drug discovery by suggesting possible lead compounds and
novel druggable protein binding pockets. In addition, iDTP could
provide insight into the binding mechanisms of known drugs for
which the drug—target complex has not yet been determined. For
example, our results suggest that formic acid binds to CYP2E1
(Supplementary file PredTargets). CYP2E1 is an enzyme known to
interact with more than 70 small drugs and xenobiotic compounds
(Ogu and Maxa, 2000). Induction of CYP2E1 has been shown to
cause oxidative stress and alcohol—induced liver injury in mouse
models (McGehee et al., 1994; Nanji et al., 1994); however,
Trolox[6—hydroxy,2,5,7,8—tetramethylchroman—2—carboxylic acid],
a drug that contains the formic acid structure, has been shown to
reduce the aforementioned toxicity (Wu and Cederbaum, 2000,
2002). Hence, our results suggest a direct interaction between the
Trolox formic acid moiety and CYP2E1 that results in reduced
toxicity.

To further evaluate the usefulness of iDTP for pharmaceutical
purposes, we identified the genetic diseases associated with the pre—
dicted target proteins for each drug using the databases—Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (Hamosh et al., 2000) and Human
Gene Mutation Database (Stenson et al., 2014). A cocitation index
with high statistical significance (P < 0.005) was found for 16 pre—
dicted drug—target pairs (including CoA—hPPARy). The predicted
drug targets were associated with major human diseases, such as
cancer, heart problems and metabolic dysfunctions (Supplementary
Table S4), making these results a potentially valuable basis for drug
discovery and repositioning. However, the use of iDTP for drug re—
positioning, in the strict sense of re—using a FDA—approved chemical
compound, remains currently limited, as a relatively large set of 3D
structures of known targets is required to construct a high—confi—
dence PPE. The rapid pace of experimental determination of protein
structures will reduce this limitation in the future.

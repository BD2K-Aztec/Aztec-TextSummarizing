ABSTRACT

Motivation: Favorable interaction between the regulatory subunit of
the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and a peptide in A-kinase
anchoring proteins (AKAPs) is critical for translocating PKA to the
subcellular sites where the enzyme phosphorylates its substrates. It
is very hard to identify AKAPs peptides binding to PKA due to the
high sequence diversity of AKAPs.

Results: We propose a hierarchical and efficient approach,
which combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, free energy
calculations, virtual mutagenesis (VM) and bioinformatics analyses,
to predict peptides binding to the PKA Rlla regulatory subunit in the
human proteome systematically. Our approach successfully retrieved
15 out of 18 documented Rlla-binding peptides. Literature curation
supported that many newly predicted peptides might be true AKAPs.
Here, we present the first systematic search for AKAP peptides
in the human proteome, which is useful to further experimental
identification of AKAPs and functional analysis of their biological
roles.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is critical to understand how the functions of kinases are regulated.
A classic kinase is CAMP-dependent protein kinase, also known as
protein kinase A (PKA) (Kim et al., 2005; Langeberg and Scott,
2005). PKA is a heterotetramer composed of two catalytic (C)
subunits and two regulatory (R) subunits. The regulatory subunit (R)
has four isoforms, RIor, R15, RIIor and R115. Each R subunit contains
an N-terminal dimerization/docking (D/D) domain followed by
an inhibitor site and two tandem CAMP binding domains. The
D/D domain is a four anti-parallel helix bundle, which provides
a stable and hydrophobic surface for peptides in A-kinase anchoring
proteins (AKAPs). The protein—protein interaction between the
PKA R subunit dimer and AKAP makes the enzyme locate at
the subcellular sites where it phosphorylates the substrates to
initiate downstream signal transduction (Carnegie and Scott, 2003;

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Langeberg and Scott, 2005). It is no doubt that the identiﬁcation of
AKAPs is critical for understanding the functional roles of PKA.

AKAPs share similar functional properties but have quite diverse
sequences and structures (Appert-Collin et al., 2006), which
makes it extremely difﬁcult to identify AKAP proteins solely
based on sequence or structural similarity (Alto and Scott, 2004).
Consequently, only a limited number of AKAPs have been identiﬁed
so far in human (Appert-Collin et al., 2006).

Numerous computational approaches have been developed to
predict the binding peptides of modular domains, such as SH2,
SH3, WW and PDZ (Brannetti et al., 2000; Ferraro et al., 2006;
Fong et al., 2004; Hou et al., 2006a, b, 2008, 2009; McLaughlin
et al., 2006; Obenauer et al., 2003; Schleinkofer et al., 2004). The
success of these approaches on various systems demonstrated the
efﬁciency of the computational methods to predict the transient and
weak binding between protein domains and peptides. Since there are
not many known AKAP peptides and no sequence motif for AKAP
peptides has been detected, it is not straightforward to apply these
methods to identify PKA—AKAP interactions. Here, we developed
a hierarchical approach by integrating information of binding free
energy calculation, secondary structure prediction, transmembrane
(TM) prediction and sequence conservation analyses of candidate
peptides to predict putative AKAPs in the human genome. Since
only crystal structure between AKAP peptide and PKA RIIor is
available, here we focused on predicting AKAPs speciﬁc for RIIor.
Our approach is readily applicable to identify the binding partners
of other regulatory subunit isoforrns of PKA as well.

Our approach includes the following steps: (i) The SWISSPROT
database (preiler et al., 2004) was screened to ﬁnd potential
AKAP peptides using a position speciﬁc scoring matrix (PSSM)
derived from the Virtual Mutagenesis (VM; Hou et al., 2006a, b)
results and prior knowledge; (ii) Secondary structure for each
candidate peptide was predicted and the peptides without helices
were removed (17 of the 18 known AKAP peptides were predicted
to form or helices); (iii) TM domain for each candidate peptide was
predicted and the peptides located within TM regions were removed
(all known AKAP peptides were predicted outside TM regions);
and (iv) Conservation analysis across seven vertebrate species was
conducted on each remaining peptide and the nonconserved ones
were removed (all known AKAP peptides are conserved). The top
500 putative AKAP peptides predicted from the human proteome
included the 14 known ones. Literature curation also suggested
that our predictions are able to identify new AKAP peptides. We
believe that this systematic prediction of AKAP peptides from the

Peptides binding to the PKA Rlloc subunit

 

entire human proteome provides the critical information for further
experimental identiﬁcation of AKAPs and investigation of their
biological functions.

2 METHODS

2.1 Molecular dynamics simulations

The crystal structure of the AKAPlO (also known as D-AKAP2) peptide
complexed with the R110; D/D domain (PDB entry: 2hwn) was used as the
template (Kinderman at al.. 2006). The 1.6A template of the DD domain
bound to a 22-residue AKAP peptide from AKAPlO has two dimersiAKAP
complexes in the asymmetric unit. Each monomer of the DD domain is
39-residue long. The binding peptide in the complex is 20-residue long. and
the peptide positions from the N- to C-terminus were referred as P27P21
(the residues at P1 and P22 are missing in the crystal structure). The ﬁrst
dimersiAKAP complex in the crystal structure was used to build the PSSM.
The two dimeriAKAP complexes align with an rmsd of 0.21 A for the
Cat atoms or an rmsd of 0.24A for the main-chain atoms. It is obvious
that these two dimeriAKAP complexes are quite similar. The complex was
solvated in a rectangular box of TIP3P water with a 9A buffer between
the solute and the box edge. The Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method was
used to calculate the full electrostatic energy of a unit cell in a macroscopic
lattice of repeating images (Darden at al.. 1993). AMBERO3 force ﬁeld
was used in the simulation (Duan at al.. 2003). Before molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. the complex was gradually relaxed by 5000 cycles of
minimization procedure (500 cycles of steepest descent and 4500 cycles of
conjugate gradient minimization). MD simulations were performed in the
NPT ensemble at a constant temperature of 300K and a constant pressure
of 1 atm. The SHAKE procedure was employed to constrain all hydrogen
atoms (Ryckaert at al.. 1977). and the time step was set to 2.0 fs. The system
was ﬁrst heated in the NVT ensemble from 10K to 300K over 20 ps. In the
following data collection period. snapshots were saved every 4 ps. yielding a
total of 250 snapshots. and the last 200 snapshots were used for free energy
calculation. All MD simulations were performed using the pmemd program
of AMBER9 (Case at al.. 2005).

2.2 The MM/PBSA calculations and the MM/GBSA
free energy decomposition analysis
The binding free energy (AGbind) was calculated using the MM/PBSA
method (Kollman at al.. 2000; Wang et al.. 2001. 2006):
AGbind = Geomplex - Gprotein - Gligand
= AEMM + AGPB + AGSA — TAS

(1)

where AEMM represents the change of molecular mechanics potential energy
upon ligand binding; AGPB and AGSArepresent the electrostatic component
and the nonpolar component of solvation free energy. respectively; iTAS is
the conformational entropy change.

AGPB was calculated using the pbsa program in AMBER9. The grid size
used to solve the PoissoniBoltzmann equation was 0.5 A. and the values
of interior dielectric constant and exterior dielectric constant were set to
1 and 80. respectively. AGSA was estimated based on the surface area:
0.0072 >< ASASA. The peptideiRHoz interaction energies were calculated
using 200 snapshots taken from 0.2 ns to 1.0 ns MD simulation trajectories
of the complex. The normal mode analysis was performed to estimate
the Vibrational component of the entropy using the nmoa’e program in
AMBER9.0 (Case at al.. 2005). Since the normal mode analysis is
computationally expensive. only 50 snapshots were used to estimate iTAS.

The interaction between each residue in the R110; D/D domain and
each peptide residue was computed using the MM/GBSA decomposition
protocol implemented in the mm _pbsa module in AMBER9. The binding
interaction of each residueiresidue pair includes three terms: van der
Waals contribution (Avaw). electrostatic contribution (A0515) and solvation

contribution (AGsolvalion). The polar contribution (AGGB) of AGsolvalion was
computed using generalized Born model based on the parameters developed
by Onufriev at al. (2000) All energy components were calculated using 50
snapshots taken from the 0.2 ns to 1.0 ns MD trajectory.

2.3 VM and PSSM

The energetic preferences of peptide residues at six positions. P5. P8. P9.
P12. P13 and P16. were analyzed using the VM technique (Hou et al.. 2006a)
because peptide array experiments indicated the preference of these amino
acids (Burns-Harnuro at al.. 2003). The peptide in the crystal structure was
used as the template and side chain mutation was performed by soap (Xiang
and Honig. 2001). Because only small or hydrophobic residues were favored
at these six positions as shown by the peptide array experiments (Burns-
Hamuro at al.. 2003). only ten amino acids. Ile. Gly. Leu. Met. Phe. Ser. Thr.
Tyr. Val and Ala. were considered in VM. Minimization. MD simulations and
MM/PBSA calculations were performed on the 10 mutated complexes for
each position using the same setup described above. The difference between
the binding free energies of the mutated peptide and the template peptide
AAG was calculated. which was used in a PSSM to represent the motif
of the RIIoz-binding peptides. For the amino acids not calculated by VM.
an arbitrary value of 50 was used in the PSSM to penalize their presence.
We considered the other peptide positions as noninformative and assigned a
value of zero in the PSSM for all amino acids but proline. Because proline
is highly unfavorable in helix. a larger penalty of 80 was assigned to proline
at each position from P1 to P19. The PSSM was then used to score all 21-
residue long human peptides in the SWISSPROT database (preiler at al..
2004). The score of each peptide was calculated as:  1 M5,,»8(S, S»). where
M 5,,» is the score of the amino acid S at i-th position in the PSSM and S,
is the amino acid at the i-th position of the peptide (the PSSM is shown in
Supplementary Table S1). For each mutated system. 1 ns MD simulations
consumed about 96 (12 X 8) CPU hours at Xeon 5130 CPU. Therefore. the
generation of the PSSM takes roughly 6.75 days with a 32-CPU Linux cluster
that is becoming commonly available.

2.4 Secondary structure prediction

Because at helix is essential for a peptide to bind the RH subunit. secondary
structure prediction was used as a ﬁlter to remove false positives. The
secondary structures for the proteins that contain putative RH-binding
peptides were predicted using three methods. Predator (Frishman and Argos.
1997). Jnet (Cuff and Barton. 2000) and Prof (Rost. 1996). Predator
only needed the query sequence. but multiple sequence alignment for
the query sequence was required for both Jnet and Prof. For the latter
two methods. the top 20 homologs of the query sequence were found
using PSI-BLAST (Altschul at al.. 1997) from the BLAST nonredundant
protein sequence database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0V/RefSeq/). Multiple
sequence alignment was then generated using ClustalW1.7 (Thompson et al..
1994). The percentage of oz-helix for the putative (Shem) RIIoz-binding
peptide was calculated as: She“X =N/21. where N is the number of residues
predicted to be oz-helical conformation. In order to have a more robust
prediction for each peptide. we calculated a consensus score by averaging the
best two She“X scores obtained from the three methods. An arbitrary cutoff
of 0.88 was chosen for the consensus score to determine whether a peptide
can form an oz-helix.

2.5 TM predictions

Because TM regions of a protein cannot interact with PKA. TM domain
prediction was used as a ﬁlter to remove false positives. TM domains of a
protein were predicted using the TMHMM program (Krogh at al.. 2001).
A candidate peptide will be removed if 10 residues of this peptide were
predicted in the TM domain.

and those in monomer 2 by primes).

2.6 Conservation analysis based on multiple sequence
alignment

Because of the functional constraint, the peptides binding to R110; should be
more conserved than random peptides. Therefore, we conducted conservation
analysis across seven vertebrate species for each putative binding peptide to
remove false positives further. The seven species are Homo sapiens (human),
Mus musculus (mouse), Bos taurus (cow), Cam's familiaris (dog), Rattus
norvegicus (rat), Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee) and Macaca mulatta (rhesus
macaque). The protein sequences for the seven species were taken from the
NCBI nonredundant protein sequence database. For each protein including
the putative binding peptide, the best match in each species, was considered
as a homolog if E-Value <10‘10; otherwise, no homolog was considered.
The human protein sequence and its homologs were then aligned using
ClustalW 1.7 (Thompson et al., 1994). Using this alignment, for the 21-
residue long putative binding peptide, we calculated a pair-wise similarity
score:  SAiBi/Zizil SAiAl. , where SAiBi is the amino acid similarity score
in the PAM500 mutation matrix (Altschul, 1991) between residueA at the i-th
position in the human peptide and residue B, in the other species. The penalty
for gap was set to —10. If no homolog was found, we considered that the
conservation analysis was not informative and set the sequence similarity
to 1.0. The average similarity score across the seven species was used to
evaluate the degree of conservation of a putative RIIoz-binding peptide.

3 RESULTS
3.1 The interactions between AKAP10 and the RIIa
D/D domain

Our 1 ns MD simulation results provided the dynamic details of the
molecular interactions between the PKA regulatory subunit and its
binding peptides. We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that the MD simulations were
stable and equilibrated by monitoring the root mean square deviation
(RMSD) of all backbone atoms relative to the starting structure
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Then we analyzed the conformational
ﬂexibility of the complex by calculating the root mean square
ﬂuctuation (RMSF) for the last 800 ps of the MD simulation
(Fig. 1). Obviously, the protein—peptide interaction stabilizes the
conformation of the residues close to, particularly the core region
of, the interaction interface, as almost all these residues have RMSF
values <3A (Fig. 1). We also found that the two monomers of
the RIIa D/D domain have quite different conformational dynamics
indicated by their different RMSF proﬁles. Overall, monomer 2

is more stable than monomer 1 as the number of residues is 10
and 16 with the criteria of <25 A RMSF for the two monomers,
respectively. Particularly, the N terminus of monomer 2 is more
stable than that of monomer 1. These observations suggested that
AKAP10 might form stronger interaction with monomer 2 than with
monomer 1.

We studied the energetic characteristics of the protein—peptide
interaction by analyzing the binding free energy components:
electrostatic (AEele), van der Waals (AEVdW), polar solvation
(AGPB) and nonpolar solvation (AGSA) energies. We observed
that the major contribution to the binding is the van der Waals
energy (—85.5 kcal/mol). The electrostatic term slightly opposes the
binding (6.2 kcal/mol), while the polar solvation term signiﬁcantly
opposes the binding (22.46 kcal/mol). As shown by the contribution
of individual peptide residues to the binding free energy using
the MM/GBSA decomposition analysis (Fig. 2 and Supplementary
Table S2), we found that seven peptide residues (A125, ng, Apg,
IP12, V1213, V1216 and M1217) form relatively stronger interactions
than the other residues as their side chains pointing toward the
protein (Fig. 2a). These residues also contribute signiﬁcant van
der Waals (AEVdW) but not electrostatic/polar (AEeS+AGpB)
interaction energy to binding (Fig. 2b and 2c), which conﬁrms
that the hydrophobic interaction is dominant for the AKAP peptide
interacting with RIIa. The AKAP10 peptide has a Trp at position
P6 (W126). This residue is not buried in the binding interface but its
large hydrophobic side chain can still form effective van der Waals
interactions with the protein (—3.12kcal/mol).

We also evaluated the contribution of each residue in the AKAP10
peptide to the binding free energy with the RIIa D/D domain, and
the total contributions and the individual energetic terms of the
important residue—residue pairs between AKAP10 and the RIIa
D/D domain are listed in Supplementary Table S2. It is apparent
that the AKAP residues at positions P5, P6, P8, P9, P12, P13, P16
and P17 have effective contacts with protein residues including
Ile3’, Ile5(Ile5’), Leu9(Leu9’), Thr10(Thr10’), Leu13(Leu13’),
Gln14(Gln14’), Thr17(Thr17’), Va118(Val18’), Thr21(Thr21’) and
Arg22. The energetic analysis conﬁrmed that the AKAP10 peptide
binding is indeed asymmetric to the two monomers of the RIIa D/D
domain. The side chains of Ile3’ and Ile5’ of monomer 2 pointed
toward the peptide, making extensive hydrophobic contacts with
the residues at positions P4, P5, P8 and P12. In contrast, the N-
terminus of monomer 1 is disordered, and the only observed contact
is between Ile5 and the peptide residue at P17. Also, the van der
Waals interactions are dominant for almost all the residue—residue
interactions.

3.2 The binding preferences of residues at the six
important positions

Because the residues at positions P5, P8, P9, P12, P13 and P16 form
strong interactions with the protein (Fig. 2a) and they are also well
conserved (Fig. 3), we studied the preference of amino acids at these
positions using the VM method (see Section 2).

Figure 1 shows that Ilepg, Alapg, 1161312 and Valp13 in the peptide
are the residues that have the least conformational ﬂuctuation. These
residues are in the center of the hydrophobic ridge of the peptide
that docks to the hydrophobic pocket of the RIIa D/D domain
(Fig. 4). Ilepg forms relatively strong van der Waals interaction
with Leu21 (—1.24kcal/mol), Ile3’ (—1.50kcal/mol), and Ile5’

VM analysis shows that several other residues, including Phe,
Ala, Leu and Tyr, are also favorable at this position (Fig. 5b).
Apparently, all residues form signiﬁcant van der Waals interaction
(—85.5 kcal/mol for Ile, —81.2 kcal/mol for Leu, —83.8 kcal/mol for
Phe and —78.8 kcal/mol for Tyr) with the protein. Our calculations
are consistent with the peptide array experiments, in which Ile is
the most favorable residue at this position, and Leu and Phe are
also highly favorable (Burns-Hamuro et al., 2003). The favorable
Ala predicted by our calculation at this position was not observed
in the array experiment. The small size of Ala might account for the
discrepancy.

favorable residues at this position are Ala (—31.9kcal/mol), Ser
(—25.0kcal/mol), Ile (—23.9kcal/mol) and Val (—22.2kcal/mol).
The peptide array experiments found that Ala, Ile and Val are
strongly favorable at this position too (Bums-Harnuro et al., 2003).

At position P12, Ile, Val and Ala are preferred in our predictions
(Fig. 5d), which is in good agreement with the array experiments
(Burns-Hamuro et al., 2003). Our analysis showed that the van der
Waals interactions, the polar contribution to the binding free energy
and conformational entropy all play important roles. For example,
although Phe at P12 forms strong van der Waals interaction with

the protein (—82.0kcal/mol), the poor polar interaction and the
conformational entropy loss make it unfavorable at this position.

Four residues were predicted to be highly preferred at
P13, including Val (—31.9kcal/mol), Thr (—25.8kcal/mol), Ile
(—25.4 kcal/mol) and Ser (—25.2kcal/mol), among which Val and
Ile were also found favorable at this position by the peptide array
experiments (Burns-Hamuro et al., 2003). The nonpolar interaction
energy AGnonpolar (the sum of the van der Waals and the nonpolar
part of the desovlation free energy) correlates well with the binding
free energy AGbind (r=0.65), while the polar interaction energy
AGPOlar (the sum of the electrostatic and the polar part of the
desovlation free energy) does not (r=0.37). This suggests that
the nonpolar interaction is the dominant factor for the amino acid
preference at this position.

The peptide array experiments showed that positions P5 and P16
are more tolerable to substitutions than positions P8, P9, P12 and
P13 (Bums-Harnuro et al., 2003). Due to this ambiguity and the
conformational ﬂexibility of these two positions, not all favored
residues observed in the array experiments, e.g. Ala at P16, have
favorable binding energy in the calculation (Fig. 5a and 5f). Finally,
we observed that proline was not favorable at almost all positions,
which is consistent with the low helix-forming propensity of proline
(Macarthur and Thornton, 1991).

3.3 The prediction of the binding peptides for the RIIa
D/D domain using a hierarchical approach

Our aim is to identify peptides binding to the RIIa D/D domain in the
human proteome, which is a very difﬁcult task. The major hurdle is
how to remove false positives. We employed a hierarchical approach
to address this issue (Fig. 6). It should be noted that for the top 10 000

a degenerated pattern (Motif 1 in Fig. 7) based on the known
AKAP peptide sequences, the peptide array experiments and the VM
calculations. The deﬁnitions of the degenerated pattern are described
in Part 1 in the supporting materials. When Motif 1 was used to scan
the SWISSPROT database, we found 802 970 matches in all species,
among which 75 256 were human peptides. After add two constrains
to Motif 1, Motif 2 was obtained and the matches to Motif 2 in the
SWISSPROT database included about 16 700 human peptides.

Although pattern match can signiﬁcantly reduce the searching
space of the RII-binding peptides, it does not rank the peptides to
suggest which peptides are more likely to be true binders. Therefore,
we devised a PSSM to rank the 16700 human 21mer peptides that
match to Motif 2 (Boeckmann et al., 2003), and the range of the
PSSM score is between 6.0 and 94.8. The element in the PSSM
was based on the VM calculations, and it is the difference (AAG)
between the binding free energy of the mutated peptide and that of
the template peptide.

The ranks for the known human RIIa-binding peptides in Figure 3
are shown in Table S3. Four AKAP peptides, AKAP10 (33),
AKAP13 (85), AKAPl (521) and AKAP9_1(894), are ranked in
the top 1000. Except AKAPll and Rab32, the other binders can be
found in the top 10 000. Therefore, we kept the top 15 000 peptides
for further analysis, which included all known AKAP peptides but
Rab32. The residue at P16 of the Rab32 peptide is His, and His at

P16 is absent from the predeﬁned motifs, so the motif search cannot
identify Rab32.

3.3.2 Secondary structure prediction One of the unique features
of the AKAP peptides is the arnphipathic a-helix. Therefore,
secondary structure prediction was used as a ﬁlter to remove false
positives. A consensus score was computed by averaging the two
highest percentages given by the three methods. Among the 18
known human AKAP peptides shown in Figure 3, 13 were predicted
to have 100% a-helices, and 4 have >90% a-helices.

Because 17 of the 18 known AKAP peptides except the AKAP12
peptide were predicted to be >90% a-helices, 90% was used as a
threshold to determine whether a peptide forms a-helix. Using this
criterion, 5411 out of the 15 000 (36.1%) peptides were predicted to
form a-helices. After we applied the consensus secondary structure
prediction as a ﬁlter to remove false positives, the ranks of the known
RIIa-binding peptides were improved signiﬁcantly (Supplementary
Table S3). For the 17 known human AKAP peptides shown in
Supplementary Table S3, 14 could be found in the top 2000 predicted
peptides.

3.3.3 TM prediction It is obvious that a TM helix cannot form
direct interaction with PKA. Indeed, all the 17 known AKAP
peptides shown in Supplementary Table S3 are not predicted to
be located in TM regions. Therefore, TM prediction was used as
a ﬁlter to remove false positives, which further improved the ranks
of the known RIIa-binding peptides signiﬁcantly (Supplementary
Table S3) and the number of candidate AKAP peptides in the human
proteome was decreased to 1869. In other words, 65.5% of the 5411
candidate peptides were removed. For the 17 known AKAP peptides
in Supplementary Table S3, 14 could be found in the top 700.

3.3.4 Conservation analysis Alignment of RIIa D/D domain
across 7 species (Fig. 8) showed that the D/D domain is highly
conserved and the variation positions are located far from the binding
site. Because of the ﬁinctional constraint, the peptides binding to the
RIIa D/D domain are also expected to be conserved across species.
When all the 21 positions in the AKAP peptide were considered
in the conservation analysis, only two of the 15 known AKAP
peptides, AKAPl and AKAP14, have the average similarities lower
than 0.90 (0.88 for AKAPl and 0.66 for AKAP14). Examination
of the multiple sequence alignments of these two peptides showed
that the variation positions do not contribute directly to the peptide
binding, i.e. positions P2, P3, P11, P14, P19, and P21 in AKAPl, and
positions P2, P3, P6, P7, P10, P11, P14, P15 and P19 in AKAP14
(Fig. 9). Consistently, if we only consider the eight important
positions in the peptide that interact directly with the protein,
including P1, P4, P5, P8, P9, P12, P13 and P16, all the 15 known
human AKAP peptides are well conserved. Twelve are completely
conserved across seven species, i.e. the average similarity is 1.00;
the rest AKAP peptides, AKAP9_1, AKAP4 and AKAP14, also

have high average similarities of 0.97, 0.90 and 0.89, respectively.
Therefore, we chose to only consider the eight important positions
in the conservation analysis and used an average similarity of 0.88
as a cutoff to remove false positives. About 35.2% peptides were
removed by the conservation ﬁlter (the number of peptides in the
ﬁnal list is 1212).

3.3.5 Analysis of the predictions by the hierarchical strategy The
secondary structure, TM and conservation ﬁlters reduced the number
of the potential RIIa-binding peptides from 15000 to 1212. The
ranks given by the PSSM showed that 14 known AKAP peptides
present in the top 450, ten in the top 300 and three in the top
50. It is obvious that the PSSM can capture the important binding
characteristics of the AKAP peptides. The only exception is AKAPll
with a low rank (1141). The basic reason for the low rank of
AKAPll is that Thr at P12 is not very energetically favorable
(AAG = 12.8 kcal/mol), therefore the rank given by the PSSM score
for the AKAPll peptide is not so high. Another possible explanation
is that the binding capability of AKAP is not only completely
determined by the known AKAP peptide but also by the ﬂanking
residues around this AKAP peptide. Certainly the contribution of
the ﬂanking residues cannot be estimated by the approach used in
this study. The binding peptides of AKAP12 and Rab32 shown in
Figure 3 could not be found because the Rab32 peptide did not
match the searching motif pattern and the AKAP12 peptide was not
predicted to form a helix.

Most known AKAPs contain multiple peptides that are ranked
in the top 15 000 using the PSSM and the highest ranked
one is often the documented binding peptides (Hundsrucker
et al., 2006) (Supplementary Table S3). We also found new
peptides ranked highest in several of these AKAPs including
AKAP8, AKAPll and MAP2 (Table S3). For example,
AADVLAEVITAAVRAVDGEGA (rank: 311) was documented as
the binding peptide of AKAP8 (Hundsrucker et al., 2006). Our
analysis ranked peptide EEVAADVLAEVITAAVRAVDG (rank:
10) much higher. Coghlan et al. (1994) showed that solid-phase
RIIa binding to the rat AKAP8 was inhibited by a synthetic
peptide of EVAAEVLAEVITAAVKAV , which is a segment of the
higher ranked peptide in our prediction. This evidence supports
that our analysis can identify new peptides binding to RIIa.
Similarly, two binding peptides were documented for MAP2:
SARIVQVVTAEAVAVLKGEQE (rank: 604) (Hundsrucker et al.,
2006) and AEEVSARIVQVVTAEAVAVLK (rank: 146) (Scholten
et al., 2006). Our analysis strongly supports the latter peptide to
be a tighter binding sequence and this prediction is waiting for
experimental validation.

The PKA binding region in AKAP14 proposed by Hundsrucker
et al. (2006) is TQDKNYEDELTQVALALVEDVINYA, in which a
segment YEDELTQVALALVEDVINYAV was found by the PSSM
search. However, this peptide is not conserved and thus was removed

by the conservation ﬁlter. Our search found another binding peptide
in AKAP14: ALALVEDVINYAVKIVEEERN (rank: 131) and its
ﬁrst 12 residues are the same as those at the C-terminus of the binding
peptide proposed by Hundsrucker et al. (2006). Kultgen et al. (2002)
reported that mutations of L43 and V47 (the bold residues in the
above sequence) to proline completely abolished the RII-binding,
which strongly supported the predicted peptide bound to the RIIa
D/D domain.

A known AKAP, WAVE-1 (Westphal et al., 2000),
was not included in the initial alignment. Two putative
RIIa-binding peptides, TNISLANIIRQLSSLSKYAED and
VISDARSVLLEAIRKGIQLRK (rank: 709), were found by the
PSSM search in the top 15 000; but only the latter peptide was
predicted to form a-helix and found conserved across the seven
species. Our prediction result was supported by the mutation
experiments, in which substitution of isoleucines 505 and 509
by proline destroyed RII interaction (Westphal et al., 2000).
Interestingly, although WAVE-1 homologs, WAVE-2, WAVE-3
and WAVE-4 show signiﬁcant sequence similarity to the putative
RIIa-binding domain of WAVE-1, the predicted AKAP peptide
in WAVE-1 is not conserved in the other three WAVE proteins.
WAVE-2, WAVE-3 and WAVE-4 can be hypothesized to not interact
with the RIIa D/D domain. The biological implication of such
interaction speciﬁcity needs further experimental investigation.

In the mouse protein MyRIP, Goehring et al. (2007) recently
reported that two peptides VALRVAEEAIEEAISKA (position
193—209) and LTEELAGTILQRIIRKQ (position 232—248) were
RII-binding regions using Solid phase peptide array . They
further demonstrated that the PKA-anchoring site on MyRIP is
located between residues 194 and 210 while residues 232—248
regulate the R11 binding negatively because the mutations at
positions 236 and 245 increase the R11 binding of MyRIP when
compared with the wild-type protein. A peptide in the human
MyRIP (TLAVALRVAEEAIEEAISKAE) was ranked 388 in our
predictions, which is consistent with the experimental observation
in mouse (Goehring et al., 2007). Given that the binding peptide is
highly conserved, we conclude that the MyRIP proteins in all the
seven species may be AKAPs.

In Figure 3, DAKAP550 is a AKAP discovered in Drosophila
(Han et al., 1997). One homology of DAKAP550, LRBA (Beige-
like protein, BLP), was found in the human proteome. It is interesting
to ﬁnd that one peptide in LRBA is also included in our prediction:
SIEASVTFLQRLISLVDVLIF (rank: 280). Given the high sequence
similarity between DAKAP550 and LRBA, our prediction results
suggest that human protein LRBA uncharacterized previously may
be involved in PKA/AKAP interaction.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have conducted systematic studies using MD simulations and
free energy calculations to characterize the binding speciﬁcity
between the human PKA RIIa regulatory subunit and its binding
peptides. We evaluated the binding preferences at several peptide
positions that interact directly to RIIa quantitatively. Our calculation
results were in good agreement with the qualitative measurements
by the peptide array experiments.

It is very challenging to predict the interacting peptides to RIIa.
To tackle this challenge, we employed a hierarchical procedure
to identify the RIIa-binding peptides from the human proteome

successfully. Our goal is to identify a list of putative binding peptides
that are ranked based on their binding with the PKA regulatory
subunit. Even without a gold standard to judge the accuracy of
our predictions, the supporting evidence for numerous predicted
peptides was indeed found in the literature. Given the difﬁculty of
identifying AKAP peptides, our study provides a useﬁil candidate
list that can narrow down the searching space for experimentalists.

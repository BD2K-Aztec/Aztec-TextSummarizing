ABSTRACT

Summary: Alternate promoter usage is an important molecular mech-
anism for generating RNA and protein diversity. Cap Analysis Gene
Expression (CAGE) is a powerful approach for revealing the multiplicity
of transcription start site (T 88) events across experiments and condi-
tions. An understanding of the dynamics of TSS choice across these
conditions requires both sensitive quantification and comparative visu-
alization. We have developed CAGExploreR, an R package to detect
and visualize changes in the use of specific TSS in wider promoter
regions in the context of changes in overall gene expression when
comparing different CAGE samples. These changes provide insight
into the modification of transcript isoform generation and regulatory
network alterations associated with cell types and conditions.
CAGExploreR is based on the FANTOM5 and MProme promoter
set definitions but can also work with user-supplied regions. The pack-
age compares multiple CAGE libraries simultaneously. Supplementary
Materials describe methods in detail, and a vignette demonstrates a
workflow with a real data example.

1 INTRODUCTION

It has been predicted that the majority of human genes have
multiple promoters. The differential use of transcription start
sites (TSSs) in alternative promoters is a complementary mech-
anism to alternate splicing for the generation of RNA diversity
that is now becoming better understood (Pal et al., 2011). Tissue-
speciﬁc TSS usage has been identiﬁed in mammalian genomes
(Carninci et al., 2006), and alternate TSS usage has been identi-
ﬁed in cancers when compared with normal cells (Thorsen et al.,
2011), implying that promoter-speciﬁc transcription coupled
with gene expression exists as hallmarks of cell state. The

profound impact of switches in transcript isoform production
is well recognized for its role in regulation (Trapnell et al., 2010).

Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE) captures, sequences
and maps capped 5/ RNA tags. In addition to being a platform
for measuring gene expression, it has more importantly provided
molecular biologists with enhanced resolution of gene regulation
by revealing the precise locations of transcription initiation
events (Plessy et al., 2010). CAGE data have recently become
more plentiful, thanks to the recent ENCODE (2012) and
FANTOMS (Forrest A.R.R. et al., 2014) publications.

Analysis of TSS choice provides insight into the variation of
transcription factor binding, epigenetic modiﬁcations and regu-
latory network activation between different cell types. Although
CAGE allows for the identiﬁcation of individual TSS, it is more
convenient to group clusters of TSSs detected in close Vicinity
into ‘promoter’ regions. This makes CAGE an attractive plat-
form for de novo promoter identiﬁcation.

The relative transcription occurring at TSSs among alternative
promoters of a gene is termed promoter composition (PC). We
describe CAGExploreR, an R package that conveniently sum-
marizes, Visualizes and ranks changes in PC (also called pro-
moter ‘switching’) genome-wide across different samples. The
dynamics of differential PC is especially intriguing when this
phenomenon leads to changes in the abundance of different tran-
script isoforms or protein products within the cell population
under study. Figure 1 highlights the conceptual difference be-
tween PC and differential gene expression. Four samples, AiD,
are evaluated at four color-coded promoter regions located near
or within a gene. Total gene expression measured as mapped tags
per million sequenced following optional library normalization
with edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010) is obtained by summing the
number of tags that map to the union of the gene region, all four
promoters including the regions between them and dividing by
effective library size. PC is measured as a proportion vector.
A and B have no change in PC, but the gene is differentially
expressed. A and C have no differential gene expression but
there is differential PC. Finally, A and D demonstrate both dif-
ferential gene expression and differential PC.

Existing bioinformatics tools that analyze count data from
sequencing technologies treat genes as elementary indiVisible
units and usually measure differences in expression Via a contrast
between two groups of samples. Examples include edgeR

Fig. 1. Differential PC and differential gene expression. A, B, C and D
are four arbitrary samples being compared. Gene displayed has four
promoters

(Robinson et al., 2010) and Cuﬂdiﬂ‘ (Trapnell et al., 2010) for
differential gene expression and transcription analysis, respect-
ively. Unlike these tools, CAGExploreR treats genes as multiunit
blocks composed of promoter subunits and compares their rela-
tive expression within the gene across samples. It is not restricted
to the analysis of contrasts between pairs of experiments but
rather is designed to scale to any number of experiments for
simultaneous comparison.

2 MODEL AND METHODS

Typical CAGE output consists of a BAM library ﬁle that maps
sequenced tags to the genome, which CAGExploreR converts to a
table of tag counts that correspond to promoter regions using either
the built-in FANTOMS, MProme (Gupta et al., 2011) or a set of
user-speciﬁed promoter deﬁnitions such as de novo identiﬁed regions.
Internally, a table of counts is generated for each mapped gene, with
rows corresponding to the different samples or libraries and columns
corresponding to promoters, and displayed accordingly as in Figure 1.
The promoter counts are normalized to proportions within each gene and
sample. The simplest case would be a 2 x 2 table when comparing the PC
across two samples for a gene with two promoters.

Genes are assigned a proportional entropy reduction score (Theil,
1970), which ranges from 0, when PC stays constant across every
sample, to 1, when every sample transcribes exclusively from a unique
promoter, for overall promoter switching. For each gene, the test of the
null hypothesis of no differential PC corresponds to the test that the
entropy reduction score is 0. P-values for this test are obtained using a
Monte Carlo approach (Supplementary Methods). The switching effect
size for promoter pairs is reported using the odds ratios for every nested
2 x 2 table within a gene. In addition, entropy-based measures are used to
quantify the level of heterogeneity in gene expression across samples. All
P-values are adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjaminii
Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate or some other ap-
propriate user-speciﬁed method.

CAGExploreR generates text-based and visual HTML reports and
ﬁgures similar to Figure 1 for further analysis. When several conditions
are being compared, they can be grouped together via hierarchical clus-
tering on a gene-by-gene basis, demonstrating which conditions have
similar PC proﬁles. This proﬁling helps demonstrate whether the PC
across replicates clusters together within experimental conditions.
Consequently, the user can assess replicate agreement at the gene level
and so can gain a sense of biological variability.

3 DISCUSSION

We present CAGExploreR, the R package that addresses the
important task of detecting changes in PC in CAGE experi-
ments. The method is scalable to any number of conditions
and/or promoter regions for simultaneous comparison. The
method is ﬂexible and can be applied to any experiment that
produces tag counts grouped by classiﬁcation factors in which
the detection of switching or changes in composition is of inter-
est, e. g. gene expression switching within gene sets, pathway ac-
tivity switching within regulatory and molecular networks,
isoform and exon switching using RNA-Seq. To use this soft-
ware for any of the aforementioned applications, the user need
only to change the genomic region deﬁnitions from promoter
regions to other regions of interest. This work is part of the
FANTOMS project. Data download, genomic tools and copub—
lished manuscripts have been summarized at http://fantom.gsc.

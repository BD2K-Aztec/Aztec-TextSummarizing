ABSTRACT

Motivation: Despite many attempts for algorithm development in
recent years, automated identification of intact glycopeptides from
LC-MS2 spectral data is still a challenge in both sensitivity and
precision.

Results: We implemented a supervised machine learning algorithm,
Random Forest, in an automated workflow to identify N-glycopeptides
using spectral features derived from ion trap-based LC-MS2 data. The
workflow streamlined high-confident N-glycopeptide spectral data
and enabled adaptive model optimization with respect to different
sampling strategies, training sample size and feature set. A critical
evaluation of the features important for glycopeptide identification fur-
ther facilitated effective feature selection for model improvement.
Using split sample testing method from 577 high-confident N-glyco-
peptide spectral data, we demonstrated that an optimal true-positive
rate, precision and false-positive rate of 73, 88 and 10%, respectively,
can be attained for overall N-glycopeptide identification

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein glycosylation is a prevalent post-translational modiﬁca-
tion, which involves intricate sets of glycan biosynthesis path-
ways to modify specific sites of the protein sequence with
attached oligosaccharide chains (preiler et al., 1999). Unlike
other post-translational modiﬁcation such as phosphorylation,
ubiquitination and methylation, protein glycosylation is struc-
turally and compositionally diverse (Ohtsubo and Marth,
2006). As glycan moiety on the protein sequence affects the
physicochemical properties of proteins through the change of
structural conformation and binding motif, glycan heterogeneity
endows glycoproteins with graduated functional versatilities in
many biological processes. For example, different glycoproteins
on the membrane of immune cells are responsible for trig-
gering immune responses to different antigens (Daniels et al.,

2002; Kolarich et al., 2012; Rudd et al., 2001; Tate et al., 2011;
Toscano et al., 2007). Glycoproteins can also modulate cell ad-
hesion and signaling by differentiating the receptors on cell sur-
face or binding to speciﬁc lectins (Haines and Irvine, 2003;
Haltiwanger, 2002; Zhao et al., 2008). Moreover, the spatial
and temporal dynamics of glycoproteins highly regulate the de-
velopment of organisms (Flanagan-Steet and Steet, 2013;
Haltiwanger and Lowe, 2004) and aberrant glycoproteins
during growth or development could cause diseases (Durand
and Seta, 2000; Lehle et al., 2006; Vivekanandan—Giri et al.,
2011). Given the signiﬁcant roles of glycosylation in mediating
the biological functions of glycoproteins and thus their clinical
implications, there is currently a growing awareness and increas-
ing demand for highly efﬁcient and precise protein glycosylation
proﬁling.

Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) technology have
enabled compositional, structural and quantitative proﬁling of
the glycomes and glycoproteomes (Morelle, 2009; Wuhrer et al.,
2007). Owing to the relatively large glycan size and compos-
itional diversity, high-throughput glycopeptide identiﬁcation
with intact glycan moiety attached is precluded from the conven-
tional approach of bottom-up database search with tandem mass
spectrometry (MS2) data. Consequently, current MS-based gly-
coproteomics technologies relie mostly on separate analysis of
released glycans and deglycosylated peptides (Sullivan et al.,
2004; Zhang et al., 2003), instead of intact glycopeptides, as it
should be. However, by doing so, the valuable information on
site-speciﬁc glycosylation and its associated heterogeneity, which
is important for delineating the function and activity of the
glycoprotein (Dube et al., 1988; Freeze and Aebi, 2005; Sumer-
Bayraktar et al., 2011), is lost in the process. Recognizing the
need to automate the laborious and often manually impossible
process of mining the intact glycopeptide MS and MS2 data,
computational tools including GlycoMiner (Ozohanics et al.,
2008), GlyPID (Mayampurath et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2010),
GlycoPep Grader (W oodin et al., 2012), Peptoonist (Goldberg
et al., 2007), GlyDB (Ren et al., 2007), Medicel Integrator
Protein N—glycosylation suite (Joenvaara et al., 2008),
GlycoPeptideSearch (Pompach et al., 2012), Byonic (Saba
et al., 2012) and GlycoPeptide Finder (Strum et al., 2013) have
been developed in recent years to facilitate site-speciﬁc
glycosylation analysis. Each of these tools differs by the compu-
tational strategies and algorithms and was often optimized for
handling datasets from only one or two of the several available
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS2)
platforms. In general, however, all share the same common

Random Forest algorithm to identify intact N-glycopeptides

 

approach for realizing the prospect of intact glycopeptide iden-
tiﬁcation. The essential steps are (i) accurate mass measurement
in precursor MS spectra; (ii) deducing possible glycan compos-
ition and peptide backbone sequence from the LC—MS2 spectra;
(iii) pattern matching the marker fragment ions for peptide back-
bone and glycan against theoretical spectra from protein and
glycan database, or attempt to de novo sequencing the glycan
moiety; and (iv) scoring for best matches. For example, using
collision-induced dissociation (CID) on a quadrupole/time-of—
ﬂight (Q/TOF) mass spectrometry, the diagnostic sugar oxonium
ions, sequential neutral losses of glycosyl residues and the Y1
ion, which is the peptide backbone plus one HexNAc attached
to Asn, can usually be detected in the LC-MS2 spectra of glyco-
peptides (Ritchie et al., 2002). These are particularly useful for
N—glycopeptide analysis because all N—glycosylations comprise a
common pentasaccharide core of Hex3HexNAc2. By matching
for monosaccharide mass difference and peptide database search
based on Y1 ion with precursor mass measured at high accuracy,
possible glycopeptides can be deduced (Wuhrer et al., 2007).
More recently, higher-energy collision dissociation and electron
transfer dissociation modes of fragmentation have been intro-
duced as alternatives or in combination with the ion trap-based
CID mode on the LTQ-Orbitrap hybrid platform to improve the
sensitivity and conﬁdence of glycopeptide identiﬁcation
(Mayampurath et al., 2011; Saba et al., 2012).

In all automated data analysis, scoring scheme is crucial to
ﬁnd the best glycopeptide from multiple candidates derived
from MS spectra, especially for unknown protein with multiple
glycosylation sites or complex sample. Most of the computa-
tional tools do provide this functionality, either using probabil-
ity-based function, such as binominal distribution (Joenvaara
et al., 2008; Mayampurath et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2010), or de-
terministic statistics, such as weighted average of important fea-
tures associated with glycan composition and peptide backbones
(Goldberg et al., 2007; Ozohanics et al., 2008; Strum et al., 2013;
Woodin et al., 2012). Recently, we have developed a computa-
tional suite called Sweet-Heart (Wu et al., 2013), which imple-
ments a novel scoring scheme based on a supervised machine
learning algorithm to first identify the glycosylation of intact
N—glycopeptides, and then to further deduce the mass values of
respective peptide backbones for further sequencing by either
targeted multi-stage mass spectrometry (MS3) or electron trans-
fer dissociation experiments. Sweet-Heart requires no prior
knowledge of glycan or peptide mass input and was shown to
outperform currently available tools in its ability to process ion-
trarrbased CID data at higher sensitivity and speciﬁcity, espe-
cially in global proteomic applications. Supervised machine
learning allows for systematic pattern identiﬁcation from a
large set of features in the training dataset and minimizes
manual tuning for optimal model generalization (Barla et al.,
2008), which is well-suited for an unbiased analysis of MS data
and has been widely applied for identiﬁcation of protein se-
quences, phosphorylation modiﬁcation, metabolite fingerprint-
ing and biomarkers (Anderson et al., 2003; Barla et al., 2008;
Elias et al., 2004; Ge and Wong, 2008; Krambeck et al., 2009;
Lahesmaa—Korpinen et al., 2010; Scott et al., 2010). Machine
learning algorithms such as linear support vector machine and
logistic regression have been used to facilitate glycosyl compos-
itional annotation and scoring of released glycans at MS level

based on known glycan compositions (Maxwell et al., 2012;
Xu et al., 2012), but not yet adapted to distinguish the correct
isomeric or isobaric entities from all possible peptide and glycan
combinations, which requires tandem MS analysis. For instance,
the mass of hexose+NeuAc is identical with fucose+NeuGc.
Deamidation on peptide also confuses the assignment between
2 fucose and 1 NeuAc or between fucose+hexose and 1 NeuGc
because of introduction of isobaric mass difference. The obstacle
for intact glycopeptide identiﬁcation using supervised machine
learning on LC-MS2 data is insufﬁcient number of high-confi-
dent spectral data for model training. As ion fragmentation pat-
terns of glycopeptides vary in different MS instrument,
ionization and fragmentation techniques, it is not easy to
obtain enough training data with comparable MS technologies
from public domains for model building. Here, we describe a
strategy to dynamically improve the supervised machine learning
algorithm, Random Forest, implemented in Sweet-Heart,
through the increment of high-conﬁdent N—glycopeptide spectral
data collected from previous model predictions. With reciprocal
model improvement, we aim for the ﬂexibility of model opti-
mization to enhance automated glycopeptide discovery with
high sensitivity and precision.

2 METHODS

2.1 The source of the datasets

The glycopeptide MS2 datasets were derived from LC-MS2 analysis of
samples prepared from human soluble epidermal growth factor receptor
(sEGFR; amino acid sequence 25—650) and Human herpesvirus 2 (strain
HGS2) (HHV2H) envelope glycoprotein D expressed in Human
Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells, mouse uterus ﬂuid, mouse
serum and digested membrane proteome of murine B-cell lymphoma
(BCLl) cells. Glycopeptides were enriched from tryptic digests of each
sample by using homemade amine-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles
(Kuo et al., 2012) or by commercially available Oasis-Max cartridge
(Waters). For the mouse serum, albumin was removed before trypsin
digestion by following a previously reported trichloroacetic acid/acetone
precipitation method (Chen et al., 2005). All samples were processed and
analyzed by nanospray LC-MS2 on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (Thermo
Scientiﬁc) in CID mode as described in Wu et a]. (2013).

2.2 Spectral feature extraction

Each raw spectral ﬁle was ﬁrst processed using DeconMSn
(Mayampurath et al., 2008) and then ﬁltered using Mascot 2.3.02. All
positively identified peptide spectra (with ion score greater than identity
score) were removed from further N-glycopeptide analysis, as those were
unlikely to be glycopeptides. The ﬁltered LC-MS2 spectra were analyzed
for N-glycopeptides by Sweet-Heart. Detailed parameters used for data-
base search and spectral feature extraction have previously been described
(Wu et al., 2013). In brief, a semi-de novo module in Sweet-Heart ﬁnds
partial glycan compositions based on sequential neutral loss of glycans
and the oxonium ions in the LC-MS2 spectrum. The N-GP combination
module in Sweet-Heart generates all possible N-glycopeptides (glycan
composition + peptide backbone) for each spectrum from species-speciﬁc
protein database of the samples that contain the consensus sequence of
Asn-X-Ser/Thr (X means any amino acid except proline) and are within
:l:10 ppm mass difference of the precursor from full scan mass spectro-
metry (MSI) measurements. Knowledge-based rules are used as criteria to
eliminate the unlikely glycan composition in mammals. All identiﬁed N-
glycopeptide candidates are then in silico fragmented based on the rules
schematically illustrated in Figure 1 and matched to the experimental

Fig. 1. A schematic illustration of the in silico fragmentation used as a basis for spectral features extracted from ion trap CID-based LC-MS2 for
prediction of N-glycopeptide with supervised machine learning. Sequential neutral losses of possible glycosyl residues from precursor and possible
peptide+core fragment ions are spectral-speciﬁc and restricted by the minimal number of glycosyl residues as determined by the semi-de novo algorithms
and the largest precursor found in the database. Only the common fragment ions associated with mammalian type of glycosylation as afforded by ion

trap-based MS2 are considered

MS2 data for spectral feature extraction by considering only the b/y-ions
of the same charge state z as the precursor, or z — 1. The spectral features
typically observed in ion trap-based CID spectra, namely the sequential
losses of common glycosyl residues found in mammals (fucose, hexose,
HexNAc, NeuSAc and NeuSGc) from the trimannosyl core
(Man3GlcNAcz) of an N-glycan attached to the peptide backbone and
its probable fragmentation were included for machine learning in this
study (Fig. 1). Features based on intensity or counts were normalized
to the base peak of the spectrum (the most intense peak of the MS2
spectrum) or the total matched peaks to ensure a uniform scale across
all variables. All other features associated with the N-glyoopeptides but
not used for machine learning were descriptive features for dataset or
glycopeptide, the original raw count features, or the oxonium ions used
as glycan ﬁlter during semi de novo. A sample of feature data for all N-
glycopeptide candidates and column descriptions can be found in
Supplementary Tables 81.] and 81.2, respectively.

2.3 Data for initial machine learning

The initial training dataset for machine learning was based on 106 manu-
ally validated spectra from human sEGFR and mouse uterus ﬂuid.
Sweet-Heart typically generates many possible N-glyoopeptide candidates
per spectrum, and true positive was deﬁned here as the one best sup-
ported by manually veriﬁable MS2 spectral features. All other candidate
matches for the same spectrum were treated as true negatives. A pair of
true-positive N-glycopeptide and one randomly selected true-negative
counterpart from each spectrum were included in the training dataset,
except for one spectrum that had only one true-positive candidate with-
out any true-negative counterpart. Random sampling was applied to
minimize any bias of the negative candidates, and paired sampling was
taken to keep the training dataset as balanced as possible for better model
performance (data not shown). To minimize the memory loading and
computing time, ﬁve randomly selected instead of all true negatives for
each of the 131 manually validated N-glycopeptide true positives from the

sEGFR sample were included in the initial testing dataset. For all subse-
quent studies after the initial model building, all candidates computed by
Sweet-Heart were included using the automated workﬂow developed.

Several well-known supervised machine learning algorithms including
support vector machine [C-SVM function from LIBSVM (Chang and
Lin, 2011)], Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Naive Bayes,
C4.S Decision Tree and Random Forest were evaluated on Weka 3.6.3
platform (Hall et al., 2009) using 36 spectral features (Supplementary
Table SL2). Random Forest algorithm outperformed all others when
the performances on the testing dataset were compared (Supplementary
Table S2). Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees generated by
the bootstrap sampling method in which each tree is grown without
pruning by a subset of variables randomly selected at each node. The
data are classiﬁed according to the majority assignment of the class from
the trees in the forest, and the internal error of misclassiﬁcation is esti-
mated by out-of-bag data not included in the bootstrap sampling for each
tree (Breiman, 2001). Given that Random Forest performed well in the
testing dataset and the ensemble algorithm is often suggested for pursuing
better classiﬁcation accuracy (Kotsiantis, 2007), Random forest was
therefore selected for N-glycopeptide scoring based on the assigned prob-
ability value ranging from 0 to 1.

2.4 Workﬂow for adaptive machine learning for N-gly-
copeptide identiﬁcation

The initial Random Forest model built on the 106 spectra using 36 nor-
malized spectral features was incorporated in Sweet-Heart to facilitate
data collection for future model improvement. We implemented a separ-
ate automated workﬂow to integrate all spectral data with N-glycopep-
tide conﬁrmation and spectral features derived from Sweet-Heart in an
embedded relational database for model improvement and optimization
(Fig. 2). The workﬂow can dynamically evaluate the performance of
Random Forest with respect to feature and sample selection (including

sampling methods and training data size). The number of trees in
Random Forest and k-fold cross-validation can also be optimized or
speciﬁed. These variables can be evaluated simultaneously or stepwise,
depending on the purpose of the study. Demonstration of feature and
sample selection is described in Section 2.5.

2.5 Implementation of dynamic feature set, sampling
methods and training sample size for model
optimization

To enable the adaptability of the N—glycopeptide identiﬁcation tool to

new samples or sampling strategies, we built the workﬂow with ﬂexible

speciﬁcations in feature sets, sampling methods for training dataset and
training sample sizes. For demonstration, we included 577 high-conﬁdent

N-glycopeptide spectra from samples described in method Section 2.1 for

the following analyses. Among them, 131 spectra from human sEGFR

sample and 74 spectra from mouse serum were conﬁrmed both by
manual validation on MS2 evidence and MS3 analyses for peptide se-
quence. All others were manually validated based solely on MS2 data

(Supplementary Table 84.1).

2.5.] Eﬂect of feature set on model performance and feature
importance evaluation Two sets of features, each including 36 and
42 features (the same 36 features plus 6 new ones), were compared to
assess how the model performed with different feature sets
(Supplementary Table SL2). Both feature sets differed by six features
extracted from the error match of peptide+HexNAc and its fragment
series in the core, including +HexNAcFuc, +HexNAc2Fuc,
+HexHexNAc2Fuc, +Hex2HexNAc2Fuc and +Hex3HexNAc2Fuc.
An error match of peptide+ HexNAc is deﬁned when there is a mass
match of peptide+HexNAc plus any one of mannose, NeuSAc and
NeuSGc residue or a mass match of peptide+HexNAc minus any one

of fucose, mannose, NeuSAc and NeuSGc residue. All other ﬁve error-
matched features are identiﬁed when the N-glycopeptide candidate does
not have any fucose residue in the glycan composition, but a match of
peptide core series with fucose is found. These six new features represent
negatively matched features inconsistent with existing patterns in the MS2
spectrum or glycan composition. A pair of one true-positive
N-glyoopeptide and one randomly selected true-negative N-glycopeptide
candidate was selected from each of the 577 spectra for training dataset.
For an unbiased evaluation of model performance between the two dif-
ferent feature sets, model performance was assessed based on S-fold
cross-validation method and was averaged over 30 training datasets in
which the data only varied in the randomly selected negative N-glycopep-
tide candidates. Three parameters were used for model performance,
including true-positive rate [true-positive rate (TPR) =total number of
top-ranked true-positive candidates with probability: 0.8/total number
of true-positive candidates], precision (total number of top-ranked true-
positive candidates with probability:0.8/total number of top-ranked
candidates with probability:0.8) and false-positive rate [false-positive
rate (FPR)=total number of top-ranked true-negative candidates with
probability 3 0.8/total number of true-negative candidates). To optimize
the number of trees in Random Forest algorithm, different numbers of
trees, 11] + v(k — 1), were simultaneously evaluated by iterating through k
times deﬁned by user along with the initial value 111 and the incremental
interval v. The optimal value was determined based on the internal error
of misclassiﬁcation estimated by out-of-bag data not included in the
bootstrap sampling (Supplementary Table S3). Moreover, variable im-
portance score generated by Random Forest was used to evaluate the
relative importance of variable for each feature set. The variable import-
ance score for the mlh variable is calculated by averaging the difference in
the sum of corrected predictions from all the trees in the forest with and
without random permutation of the value in the mlh variable using the
out-of-bag data (Breiman, 2001). The higher the importance score, the
greater inﬂuence of the variable on the model prediction.

2.5.2 Eﬂect of sampling methods and training sample sizes on
model performance Two sampling methods were compared to evalu-
ate the difference in random and balanced glycoform sampling strategy
for training dataset effect on the model performance using the optimized
feature set following the result from Section 2.5.1. The glycoforms used
here were based on the glycan composition, considering only fucose,
hexose, HexNAc, NeuSAc and NeuSGc. The random sampling method
chose a portion of 557 high-conﬁdent true-positive N-glycopeptide spec-
tral data for training dataset. The corresponding true-negative candidate
of the spectrum was randomly chosen to make both positive and negative
candidates balanced in the training dataset. Balanced glycoform sampling
method randomly chose a portion of glycoforms from high-conﬁdent
true-positive N-glycopeptide data for training dataset. In each glycoform,
equal numbers of true-positive N-glycopeptides were randomly chosen
for the training dataset according to the selected portion. When the
number of N-glycopeptides for a particular glycoform was not enough,
it included only what was available and would not resample the same
data twice. Similarly, the same number of true-negative candidates from
the corresponding spectrum was randomly chosen to make both classes
balanced in the training dataset. A total of 30 training datasets were
generated to estimate the variability of the model because of different
datasets. The portion unused for training dataset was included for testing
data to ensure independence between the training and testing dataset.
Different training sample sizes were evaluated simultaneously with the
sampling methods to identify the effect on model performance. To make
the random and balanced glycoform sampling method comparable, the
training sample size for both methods was kept the same. Five different
training sample sizes were used for comparison. For balanced glycoform
sampling method, 90% of 103 glycoforms was included for training data-
set. The ﬁve different sizes of training datasets ranging from one to ﬁve
true-positive N-glyoopeptides per glycoform were chosen. The same

numbers of true-negative N-glycopeptides in the corresponding spectrum
were randomly selected to make the training dataset balanced. For
random sampling method, 16, 28, 36, 43 and 48% of 577 true-positive
N-glycopeptides were randomly selected for the ﬁve different training
datasets. One true-negative N-glyoopeptide from the corresponding spec-
trum was randomly selected to make the training dataset balanced. All
spectra not included in the training dataset were used as testing dataset
for evaluation of model performance.

2.6 Statistical analysis

R Statistics was used for statistical analyses (R Development Core Team,
2012). To test the difference of means, Shapiro and Bartlett test were
conducted ﬁrst to determine the normality of data distribution and
homogeneity of variance. If the distribution is normal and variance is
homogenous, ANOVA (for three groups or more) or Student’s t test (for
two groups) is used, otherwise KruskaleWallis test. For multiple com-
parisons, the Tukey procedure was chosen after ANOVA or the krus-
kalmc procedure (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) after KruskaleWallis test.

2.7 Software implementation

A fully automated workﬂow was developed in Java 1.6 with embedded
relational database using JavaDB. Source codes for Random Forest and
other machine learning modules were adopted from Livingston (2005)
and Weka 3.6.3 (Hall et al., 2009), respectively. The software had the
following speciﬁcations, including (i) allowing the multiple ﬁle inputs of
N-glycopeptide candidate data with spectral features in text format pre-
viously generated from the modules of Sweet-Heart (Supplementary
Table SI) and storing them in an embedded relational database, (ii) ac-
cepting high-conﬁdent N-glycopeptide data in text format with MS3 con-
ﬁrmation or manual validation (when MS3 spectra are not available), as
the true-positive candidates for model construction (Supplementary
Table 813), (iii) providing two sampling strategies (random or balanced
method in current version) with user-deﬁned variables for construction of
training dataset, (iv allowing dynamic evaluation of different number of
trees grown in Random Forest model and feature set for model optimiza-
tion and (v) generating a summary report of variable importance score
and model performance based on k-fold cross-validation or split sample
test.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

3.1 The optimization of the spectral feature set for iden-
tiﬁcation of N-glycopeptides

To optimize the spectral feature set used in the model, we com-

pared two sets of spectral features that differed by six features

extracted from the error match of peptide+HexNAc and its

fragment series in the core. The training dataset for Random
Forest model was built using all 577 true-positive N-glycopep—
tides, and one true-negative N-glycopeptide was randomly se-
lected from each respective spectrum to make the training
dataset balanced. However, there were 23 spectra, which af-
forded only true-positive without any true-negative N-glycopep—
tide candidate. The training dataset was therefore slightly
unbalanced. For these spectra with single N-glycopeptide candi-
date, only one glycan composition is possible for their respective
precursor masses to ﬁnd a matched peptide mass in the database
after considering all possible combinations of glycosyl residues
allowed by predeﬁned biosynthesis rule. Based on the result of 5-
fold cross-validation averaging 30 training datasets, the model
built with 42 features consistently performed better (P<0.05) in
TPR, precision and FPR than that of 36 features (Table 1). The
results indicate that the performance of the model could beneﬁt
from incorporating six additional features from the error match
of peptide+HexNAc and its fragment ion series, albeit amount-
ing to only a relatively small improvement.

3.2 Feature importance using variable importance score

We examined the key features for identiﬁcation of the N-glyco-
peptides using the variable importance score of Random Forest
algorithm from the same 30 training datasets described above.
We found that the key features were similar between the models
based on the 36 and 42 feature set (Fig. 3 and Supplementary
Table S5). The percent intensity of matched peptide +HexNAc
(PPEPN) was a predominant feature with an importance score
more than twice of the second ranked feature, which was the
percent intensity of matched peptide +HexNAcQ (PPEPNN).
PPEPN is commonly known as Y1 ion, which is the key ion
used in most informatics solutions to identify a particular
N-glycopeptide by CID MS2 (Joenvaara et al., 2008;
Mayampurath et al., 2011; Ozohanics et al., 2008; Woodin
et al., 2012). The top ﬁve important features for the 36 and 42
feature set were the same and accounted for 55 and 49% of the
total importance score, respectively. Four of the top ﬁve import-
ant features were extracted from the glycan core fragments with
the peptide backbone. Among the features, which include ions
from both the peptide+ glycan core fragments and the glycan
extension, the percent total number of matched peaks >5% of
base peak intensity (PMTACH_F) was ranked the ﬁfth.
Proportionally, features from peptide+glycan core fragments
had higher rank than those features with all ion types considered,

Fig. 3. Averaged variable importance score of the top 20 features from
the Random Forest model based on the 36 and 42 feature sets. Error bar
denotes one standard deviation

suggesting a stronger inﬂuence of peptide+glycan core frag-
ments on model performance. It was also noted that the percent
intensity of error-matched peptide + HexNAc (PPEPNER), per-
cent intensity of error-matched peptide+Hex2HexNAcQFuc
(PEPNFNHHER) and percent intensity of error-matched
peptide+Hex3HexNAcQFuc (PEPNFNHHHER) were all
ranked in the top 20 among the 42 feature set. The relatively
higher importance scores of these error-matched features also
signify their contribution to data classiﬁcation and the improve-
ment of model performance in the dataset consisting of the 42
feature set.

3.3 Effect of sampling method and training set size on the
model performance

We also evaluated the model performance by using the portion
of the spectra not included in the model so that the testing data
were independent to the data used in the model. Unlike data for
k-fold cross-validation, the testing datasets from split sample
reﬂect the actual data distribution in a spectrum where there
are usually large numbers of true-negative N-glycopeptides but
one true-positive N-glycopeptide per spectrum. TPR, precision
and FPR were again used to evaluate the effect of sampling
method and training sample size on model performance
based on the optimized feature set of 42 described in Section
3.1. Because N—glycopeptides of high mannose type
(HexngexNAcz) often yielded peptide+HexNAc fragment
ions at distinctively higher intensity, we compared the model
performance between N—glycopeptides of high mannose and
non-high mannose (with spectral evidence of additional fucose,
HexNAc, Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc extending from the glycan core
moiety) types. Figure 4 and Supplementary Table S6 show the
averaged TPR, precision and FPR with :l: standard deviation for
total tested spectra and two subgroups (high mannose and non-
high mannose type) with respect to five different training sample
sizes and two sampling methods. The letters on top of each bar
indicate multiple comparison results from KruskaleWallis test.
Any two groups are considered signiﬁcantly different (P<0.05)
if they do not share any letters between each other.

TPR was generally improved as the training sample size
increased. However, the improvement was not as significant
once it reached the size of 162 spectra. Random sampling and
balanced glycoform sampling methods had similar effect on the

TPR of total tested spectra but signiﬁcantly differed in their
effect on high mannose type. The TPR for high mannose type
based on the random sampling method was consistently higher
across the ﬁve training sets than that of the balanced glycoform
sampling method. Although the effect of both sampling methods
on non-high mannose type was not statistically different, there
was a trend in which the balanced glycoform sampling method
had slightly better TPR than the random sampling method.
Regardless of the sampling method and training sample size,
the TPR of the model was higher for high mannose type than
non-high mannose type. The best TPR for predicting N-glyco-
peptides was all found at the largest training dataset (277 spec-
tra). The best TPR :l:1 SD for total tested spectra, high mannose
type and non-high mannose type based on random sampling
method were 0.732 :l: 0.053, 0.920 :l: 0.037 and 0.649 :i: 0.076, re-
spectively. The best TPR for total tested spectra, high mannose
type and non-high mannose type based on balanced glycoform
sampling method were 0.739 :l: 0.046, 0.798 :i: 0.065 and 0.677 :i:
0.065, respectively.

The precision of the model for predicting total tested spectra
and high mannose type was relatively independent of the size of
training dataset and the sampling methods with an average value
>0.8 for total tested data and 0.9 for high mannose type (Fig. 4).
One exception is the signiﬁcantly low precision from 92 training
dataset based on the balanced glycoform sampling method. For
non-high mannose type, the precision based on random sampling
method was signiﬁcantly (P<0.05) higher than balanced glyco-
form sampling method across five different training datasets.
Similar to TPR, the best precision was afforded by the largest
training dataset, and high mannose type had better precision
than non-high mannose type. The best precision :l:1 SD for
total tested spectra, high mannose type and non-high mannose
type based on random sampling method were 0.878:l:0.043,
0.9933 :i:0.0084 and 0.816:l:0.066, respectively. The best preci-
sion for total tested spectra, high mannose type and non-high
mannose type based on balanced glycoform sampling
method was 0.842 :l: 0.048, 0.9770 :l: 0.0070 and 0.723 :l: 0.077,
respectively.

The FPR of the model for predicting total spectra and sub-
groups based on the random sampling method consistently out-
performed the balanced glycoform sampling method across all
ﬁve training datasets (Fig. 4). Increase in the size of training
dataset generally improved the FPR of the model in most of
the data groups, although the trend was less evident than that
was found in TPR. The best FPR :l:1 SD based on the random
sampling method for total tested spectra and those of high man-
nose and non-high mannose types were obtained by using the
largest training dataset at a value of 0.103:i:0.036, 0.0067:i:
0.0084 and 0.150:l:0.051, respectively. In contrast, the best
FPR was not always attained by the largest training dataset
using the balanced glycoform sampling method, although the
corresponding values were not statistically different. For the pur-
pose of data comparison, the FPR based on balanced glycoform
sampling method for total tested spectra and those of high man-
nose and non-high mannose type were 0.138:l:0.045, 0.0267:i:
0.0088 and 0.234:l:0.083, respectively, by the largest training
dataset.

Our studies indicate that all factors including feature set, type
of glycoforms, training sample size and sampling method

I balanced glycoform sampling El random sampling

Fig. 4. Comparison of model performance with respect to ﬁve different training datasets (92, 162, 208, 247 and 277 spectra) and two sampling methods
(balanced glycoform and random sampling). TPR, precision and FPR of total tested spectra (Total) and subgroups based on high mannose (HM) and
non-high mannose type (non-HM) were calculated. The same letter above each bar in the graphs denotes no signiﬁcant difference between the means at
P< 0.05 by Kruskal—Wallis test. The box corresponds to the 25th and 75th percentiles of the data. The whiskers of the box are the highest and lowest
data points that are within 15 fold of the box length (inter-quartile range, IQR). Outliers that are outside 1.5xIQR are labeled in black dot

contributed to model performance. Random sampling method
seems to have better overall model performance than the
balanced glycoform sampling method, but the difference can
be compensated by increasing the training sample size.
Random sampling method allows a similar data distribution be-
tween training and testing dataset, whereas balanced glycoform
sampling method ensures equal representation of glycoforms in
the sample data to the training dataset. The glycoform distribu-
tion in our sample data is highly diverse and unbalanced. High
mannose type consisted of only six different glycoforms
(Hex5_9HexNAcz) but accounted for 31% of the data. Non-
high mannose type consisted of the total 97 glycoforms, but
one-fourth of them were unique (i.e. 26 non-high mannose glyco-
forms only occur once) (Supplementary Table $41). The high
proportion of unique glycoforms in the sample data results in a
higher dissimilarity in glycoform distribution between training
and testing dataset with the balanced glycoform sampling
method. As supervised machine learning performs better when
training and testing data are similar, it is not surprising that the
random sampling method is found better than the balanced gly-
coform sampling method in our study. However, the results from

the balanced glycoform sampling method help to evaluate how
our model would perform in the real scenario when the training
dataset is not a sufﬁcient representative of the real testing data-
set. Under sub-optimal sampling strategy by the balanced glyco-
form sampling method, the overall Random Forest model
performance was still robust with 74% TPR, 84% precision
and 14% FPR.

Our studies further revealed that high mannose type was con-
sistently better predicted by the model than non-high mannose
type regardless of the sampling method. Both TPR and precision
were above 90%, whereas FPR was <1 % for high mannose type.
According to our observation from the 577 N-glyoopeptide spec-
tra, the percent intensity of peptide+HexNAc and peptide+
HexNAcQ in high mannose type was usually at least ﬁve times
higher than that of non-high mannose type on average
(Supplementary Table S4.2). Because peptide+HexNAc and
peptide+HexNAcQ were the two most important features
found in the model for N-glycopeptide identiﬁcation, it may ex-
plain why high mannose type was better predicted by the model
than non-high mannose type. At optimal performance, the latter
afforded TPR, precision rate and FPR of 65, 82 and 15%,

respectively. Non-high mannose type as defined here includes the
hybrid and complex forms, which result from further processing
of the high mannose types in Golgi involving a series of glyco-
syltransferases (Neelamegham and Liu, 2011). The accessibility
of the high mannose type glycans to these downstream diversiﬁ-
cations is apparently dictated by the inherent physicochemical
properties of the underlying peptide backbone (Thaysen-
Andersen and Packer, 2012), in particular, the local primary
structure around the glycosylation site (Petrescu et al., 2004).
In fact, peptide sequence and structure features have been used
for identiﬁcation of glycosylation sites with Random Forest al-
gorithm with accuracy ranging from 72.8 to 92.8% (Hamby and
Hirst, 2008; Karnik et al., 2009). Inclusion of these peptide-spe-
ciﬁc features in our model should be beneficial, especially for
prediction of non-high mannose type glycopeptides. The overall
performance, as demonstrated by the relatively high precision
rates and low FPR found for both types of glycoform, suggests
the usability of the workﬂow for high-throughput N-glycopep-
tide discovery. Our results were also consistent with other find-
ings, which demonstrated the robustness of Random Forest
algorithm in MS-based proteomic applications, such as bio-
marker identiﬁcation (Barrett and Cairns, 2008; Fusaro et al.,
2009; Ge and Wong, 2008; Izmirlian, 2004; Wu et al., 2003).
Future efforts should focus on the expansion of sample size
and peptide-speciﬁc features to better represent the wide array
of glycoforms in the training sample data.

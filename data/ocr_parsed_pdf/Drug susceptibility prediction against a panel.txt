Drug susceptibility prediction against a panel of drugs

 

maximization algorithm to simultaneously cluster groups of
similarly behaving compounds and infer a predictive model for
each cluster. Heider et a]. (2013) formulate predicting drug re—
sistance against a panel of HIV—1 drugs as a ‘multilabel learning’
problem (Tsoumakas et al., 2010), which aims to use all available
information by learning models for all drugs simultaneously.
They show that this joint modeling approach is better than in—
dependent modeling in terms of predictive performance.
However, their algorithm has some limitations: (i) It is based
on the classiﬁer chains formulation (i.e. training separate pre—
dictors for all drugs successively linked along a chain) (Read
et al., 2011), which is not sufﬁcient to capture more complex
dependencies between drugs. (ii) It assumes that each data
point have the corresponding drug resistance score for all of
the drugs considered (i.e. no missing output), which limits the
applicability of the proposed method because, in large—scale
pharmacogenomic assays, there may be many missing values
owing to experimental conditions, quality control reasons, etc.

For predicting drug susceptibility against a panel of drugs, we
propose a novel Bayesian formulation that combines kernel—
based non—linear dimensionality reduction (Scholkopf and
Smola, 2002) and binary classiﬁcation (or regression) in a ‘multi—
task learning’ framework (Caruana, 1997), which tries to solve
distinct but related tasks jointly to improve overall generalization
performance. Our proposed method, called ‘kemelized Bayesian
multitask learning’ (KBMTL), has two key properties: (i) It
maps all data points into a shared subspace and learns predictive
models for all drugs simultaneously in this subspace to capture
commonalities between the drugs. Joint modeling of drugs en—
ables us to eliminate off—target effects and drug—speciﬁc experi—
mental noise, leading to a better predictive performance. (ii) It
can handle missing values of drug susceptibility measurements,
which enables us not to discard data points with missing outputs,
leading to larger data collections. As a result, the obtained pre—
dictions become more robust especially for drugs with a large
number of missing phenotype values.

To show the performance gain of our method over standard
modeling approaches, we perform cross—validation experiments
on two benchmark drug susceptibility datasets of HIV and
cancer.

2 MATERIALS

In this study, we use two different drug susceptibility datasets, which we
extract from the following sources: (i) HIV Drug Resistance Database
(HIVDB) (Rhee et al., 2003), (ii) Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in
Cancer (GDSC) (Yang et al., 2013). These two data sources are publicly
available at http://hivdb.stanford.edu and http://www.cancerrxgene.org,
respectively.

2.1 HIV drug resistance database

HIVDB contains phenotype and genotype information about HIV -1 (i.e.
viral reverse transcriptase sequences with corresponding susceptibility re-
sults and amino acid sequences). We extract all reverse transcriptase
sequences originated from subtype B strains, which gives us 970 reverse
transcriptase sequences in total. We use drug susceptibility results mea-
sured using the PhenoSense method for eight nucleoside analogs, namely,
Lamivudine (3TC), Abacavir (ABC), Zidovudine (AZT), Stavudine
(d4T), Zalcitabine (ddC), Didanosine (ddI), Tenofovir (TDF) and

Emtricitabine (FTC). Drug susceptibility results are given as fold
change in susceptibility (i.e. standardized measure of HIV drug resist-
ance), which is deﬁned as

IC50 of an isolate

IC t. = ' i
50 ra 10 IC50 of a standard w1ld-type COHtrOl lsolate

 

where IC50 of a resistant or wild-type control isolate gives its half max-
imal inhibitory concentration. We label reverse transcriptase sequences as
‘resistant’ or ‘susceptible’ using drug-speciﬁc cutoff values as done simi-
larly in the earlier studies (Heider et al., 2013; Rhee et al., 2006). The
cutoffis set to 1.5 for d4T, ddC, ddI and TDF, and to 3.0 for 3TC, ABC,
AZT and FTC. Supplementary Figure S1 shows the drug resistance labels
and the histogram of available IC50 ratios for 970 reverse transcriptase
sequences.

We remove the sequences with no phenotype information (i.e. 48 re-
verse transcriptase sequences with no IC50 ratios), leading to a ﬁnal
dataset with 922 reverse transcriptase sequences. Table 1 summarizes
the ﬁnal dataset by listing the drug name, the corresponding analog,
the number of reverse transcriptase sequences with measured IC50
ratio, the IC50 ratio cutoff and the ratio between resistant and susceptible
classes for each drug.

For each reverse transcriptase, genotype information is extracted from
the amino acid sequence of positions 17240. Amino acid differences from
the subtype B consensus wild-type sequence are considered as mutations.
There are 1474 unique mutations for 922 reverse transcriptase sequences
in our dataset, which means each reverse transcriptase sequence can be
represented as a 1474-dimensional binary vector.

2.2 Genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer

GDSC contains phenotype and genotype information about cancer (i.e.
cancer cell lines with corresponding sensitivity results and genomic pro-
ﬁles). We use drug sensitivity results measured against 138 anticancer
drugs, which are given in terms of half maximal inhibitory concentration
(ICSO) and area under the doseiresponse curve (AUC) values. We choose
to perform our analysis on AUC values because IC50 values are not
observed before the maximum screening concentration for a signiﬁcant
proportion of the drug and cell line pairs (i.e. most of the cell lines are
resistant to a given drug within the range of experimental screening con-
centrations). Supplementary Figure S2 shows the AUC values and the
histogram of available doseiresponse curves for 790 cancer cell lines.
GDSC contains genomic proﬁles in the forms of copy number vari-
ation, gene expression and mutation proﬁles. We choose to use only gene
expression, as it is shown to be the most informative data source in earlier
studies (Jang et al., 2014). Gene expression proﬁle is extracted from
hybridized RNA in HT-HGU133A Affymetrix whole genome array.

We can bound the marginal likelihood using Jensen’s inequality:

and optimize this bound by maximizing with respect to each factor sep-
arately until convergence. The approximate posterior distribution of a
speciﬁc factor I can be found as

no cx exp (Eq((~)\r)[10g1’({yr}rT= 1, @HKJLIH).

For our proposed model, thanks to the conjugacy, the resulting
approximate posterior distribution of each factor follows the same
distribution as the corresponding factor. The technical details of our
inference mechanism can be found in the Supplementary Material.

where ZH is the normalization coefﬁcient calculated for the test data

3.3 Baseline algorithms

To show the practical importance of multitask learning, we compare our
method to two baseline algorithms: (i) Bayesian single-task learning and
(ii) kernelized Bayesian single-task learning. The technical details for the
baseline algorithms can be found in the Supplementary Material.

3.3.1 Bayesian single—task learning Instead of learning a uniﬁed
model for all tasks conjointly, we can train a separate model for each
task. For this purpose, we use a Bayesian linear classiﬁcation algorithm,
which is known as ‘probit classiﬁer’ (Albert and Chib, 1993). We call this
algorithm ‘Bayesian probit classiﬁer’ (BPROBIT).

3.3.2 Kernelizea’ Bayesian single—task learning Instead of training
a linear model, we can also use a kernelized algorithm to obtain non-
linear models. For this purpose, we use a kernelized Bayesian classiﬁca-
tion algorithm, which is known as ‘relevance vector machine’ (Bishop and
Tipping, 2000; Tipping, 2001). We call this algorithm ‘Bayesian relevance
vector machine’ (BRVM).

3.4 Extension to regression problems

Our method and two baseline algorithms are deﬁned for the binary clas-
siﬁcation scenario but they can easily be extended to regression problems.
The technical details for the regression variant of our method can be
found in the Supplementary Material. We explain the regression variant
of our method in detail, and the regression variants of baseline algorithms
can also be derived similarly.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed KBMTL method,
we report its results on two datasets and compare it with two
baseline algorithms, namely, BPROBIT and BRVM. We have
three main reasons for these particular choices: (i) Both
BPROBIT and BRVM use same type of inference mechanism
with our method. (ii) BPROBIT is from the family of linear and
regularized algorithms, which are considered as the standard ap—
proach for drug susceptibility prediction. (iii) We can see the
effect of multitask formulation by comparing our method to

BRVM, which can also make use of kernel functions for drug—
specific models.

4.1 Experimental setting and performance metrics

For each dataset, data points are split into ﬁve subsets of roughly
equal size. Each subset is then used in turn as the test set, and
training is performed on the remaining four subsets. This pro—
cedure is repeated 10 times (i.e. 10 replications of 5—fold cross—
validation) to obtain robust results.

We use ‘area under the receiver operating characteristic curve’
(AUROC) to compare classiﬁcation results. AUROC is used to
summarize the receiver operating characteristic curve, which is a
curve of true positives as a function of false positives while the
threshold to predict labels changes. Larger AUROC values cor—
respond to better performance.

We use ‘normalized root mean square error’ (NRMSE) to
compare regression results. NRMSE of drug I can be calculated
as

 

(y: _ 5]!)1—(yt _ 57:)
(y: _ IITyt/NI)T(.V2 _ IITyi/Nt)
where y, and j), denote the measured and predicted output vec—

tors, respectively. Smaller NRMSE values correspond to better
performance.

 

NRMSE, = \/

4.2 Performance comparison on HIVDB

On HIVDB, we compare three algorithms, namely,
BPROBIT, BRVM and KBMTL, in terms of their classiﬁcation
performances. For BPROBIT, the hyper—parameter values are se—
lected as (a,,, ﬂy)=(1, 1), (an, ﬁn) =(1, 1) and v = 1. For BRVM,
the hyper—parameter values are selected as (a,,, ﬂy)= (1, 1), (00‘,
ﬁx) = (1, 1) and v = 1. For KBMTL, the hyper—parameter values
are selected as (aA,ﬂA)=(1, 1), ah=0.1, aw=1 and v = 1. The
shape and scale hyper—parameters of gamma distributed priors
are set to non—informative values not to impose sparsity on the
model parameters. The number of components in the hidden
representation space is selected as R = 10. For all algorithms,
we perform 200 iterations during variational inference.

To calculate similarity between reverse transcriptase sequences
for BRVM and KBMTL, we use the Gaussian kernel deﬁned as
kg(x,~,xj)=exp (—||x,~—xj||§/s2), where the kernel width s is
chosen among m, m, m, m and x/ﬁ using an internal
5—fold cross—validation scheme on the training set. We decide to
make a selection from these particular values because the mean
of pairwise Euclidean distances between data points, which is
frequently used as the default value for s, is approximately 

Table 2 gives the mean and standard deviation of AUROC
values obtained by BPROBIT, BRVM and KBMTL for each
drug over 50 replications as their performance measures. We see
that KBMTL obtains the highest mean AUROC values for seven
of eight HIV—1 drugs by improving the results from 0.5 (3TC) to
2.3% (TDF) compared with the second highest. For FTC,
BPROBIT obtains the highest mean AUROC value, whereas
KBMTL falls behind by 0.3%. We also report the average
AUROC values over drugs in the last row of Table 2. We see
that KBMTL outperforms BPROBIT and BRVM by 2.1 and
1.7%, respectively. Figure 3 compares the performance of

BPROBIT, BRVM and KBMTL for each drug using box—and—
whisker plots. It also compares KBMTL and the best baseline
algorithm for each drug using scatterplots. We clearly see that
KBMTL is superior to BPROBIT and BRVM on all drugs
except FTC. The performance differences obtained by
KBMTL over BPROBIT and BRVM on these seven drugs are
statistically signiﬁcant according to the paired t—test with
P<0.01. The increased performance of KBMTL cannot be
explained by the non—linearity introduced owing to the
Gaussian kernel alone because BRVM also uses the Gaussian
kernel and is able to outperform BPROBIT by only 0.4%. The
main reason of this increased performance is the joint modeling
of drugs with multitask learning.

To illustrate the biological relevance of our method, we ana—
lyze the ability to identify drugs with similar mechanisms of
action based on hierarchical clustering of drugs based on the
task—speciﬁc classiﬁcation parameters inferred by KBMTL.
Supplementary Figure S3 compares the clustering results ob—
tained using KBMTL parameters versus clustering based on
similarity of IC50 ratios. We see that the analogs of Cytidine
(3FC and FTC) are clustered together at the bottom level of
the dendogram using both IC50 ratios and KBMTL parameters
for correlation calculation. However, the other drugs with the
same analog are not clustered together at the bottom level based
on IC50 ratios. If we use the task—speciﬁc classiﬁcation param—
eters {w,}§=l found by KBMTL for correlation calculation,
hierarchical clustering is able to ﬁnd three clusters: (i) analogs
of Cytidine (3TC and FTC), (ii) analogs of Guanosine (ABC and
ddI) and (iii) analogs of Thymidine (AZT and d4T). These re—
sults show that KBMTL is able to reveal underlying biological
similarities between drugs and to make use of this information to
improve predictive performance.

4.3 Performance comparison on GDSC

On GDSC, we compare four algorithms, namely, BRVM with
the linear kernel (BRVM[L]), BRVM with the Gaussian kernel
(BRVM[G]), KBMTL with the linear kernel (KBMTL[L]) and
KBMTL with the Gaussian kernel (KBMTL[G]), in terms of

all tasks conjointly. For this purpose, we propose a novel
Bayesian multitask learning algorithm that combines kernel—
based non—linear dimensionality reduction and binary classiﬁca—
tion to classify data points as resistant or susceptible. We
formulate a deterministic variational approximation inference
scheme, which is more efficient than using a Gibbs sampling
approach in terms of computation time. We then extend our
algorithm to regression to predict real—valued outputs such as
half maximal inhibitory concentration and AUC.

The main novelty of our approach comes from the joint
Bayesian formulation of projecting data points into a shared
subspace and learning predictive models for all drugs in this
subspace, which enables us to capture commonalities between
subsets of drugs to improve predictive performance. The
increased performance is due to elimination of off—target effects
and drug—speciﬁc experimental noise that may be present in drug
susceptibility values. Another novelty of our approach comes
from the ability to handle missing drug susceptibility values
owing to experimental conditions and quality control reasons,
which increases the effective sample size, leading to more robust
predictions especially for drugs with a large number of missing
phenotype values.

To demonstrate the performance of our algorithm, called
KBMTL, we perform cross—validation experiments on drug sus—
ceptibility datasets of two major human diseases, namely, HIV
and cancer. For the HIV dataset, we classify viral reverse tran—
scriptase sequences as resistant or susceptible against eight nu—
cleoside analogs using mutation proﬁles extracted from sequence
information of the viral genotype. Our multitask learning
method obtains statistically significantly better results on seven
of eight drugs compared with two baseline single—task learning
methods that consider each drug separately. For the cancer data—
set, we predict AUC within the range of experimental screening
concentrations for each cell line against 138 anticancer drugs
using gene expression proﬁles. Our method with the linear or
Gaussian kernel obtains statistically signiﬁcantly better results
on 102 or 98 of 138 drugs, respectively, compared to a single—
task learning method with the same kernel function. These re—
sults show that predicting drug susceptibility against a panel of
drugs simultaneously within a multitask learning framework im—
proves overall predictive performance over single—task learning
approaches that learn drug—speciﬁc models.

We implement both single—task and multitask learning meth—
ods using efﬁcient variational approximation schemes, where co—
variance calculations are the most time—consuming steps because
of matrix inversions. BRVM has O(N3) complexity per iteration,
but we need to train a separate model for each drug, leading to
(9(TN3) overall complexity. KBMTL learns a uniﬁed model for
all drugs conjointly and has (9(RN3 +NR3+ T R3) complexity
per iteration, which shows that our algorithm has comparable
computational complexity with single—task learning methods up
to moderate values of R.

We envision several possible extensions of our work in future
pharmacogenomic applications. Based on an analysis over
KBMTL model parameters, we are able to identify groups of
compounds with similar mechanisms of action. As functional
screens are being performed on increasingly large numbers of
compounds or genetic perturbations, often with poorly charac—
terized mechanisms or strong off—target effects, jointly modeling

Drug susceptibility prediction against a panel of drugs

 

each compound in the context of the full screening collection
should yield novel insights into compound mechanisms.
Moreover, the ability to identify groups of related compounds
with a shared robust molecular predictor should aid drug discov—
ery efforts by improving the interpretability of large screens and
providing multiple lead compounds effecting similar biological
processes. From an algorithmic perspective, the kernelized
Bayesian framework provides an extensible template for
incorporating prior knowledge. For example, prior information
may be incorporated to encourage similar predictors to be
inferred for compounds known to target proteins in the same
pathway. Importantly, extensions of more complex prior infor—
mation are computationally tractable owing to the highly efﬁ—
cient inference performed by the variational Bayes algorithm. In
summary, we believe that the method presented in this work
contributes to the field of pharmacogenomic analysis by improv—
ing the robustness of drug susceptibility predictions by leveraging
information shared across multiple compounds in a screen, and it
provides an efﬁcient Bayesian inference framework that may be
applied and extended by the community in future applications.

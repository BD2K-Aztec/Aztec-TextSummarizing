ABSTRACT

Motivation: Measuring the effects of base mutations is a
powerful tool for functional and evolutionary analyses of RNA
structures. To date, only a few methods have been developed
for systematically computing the thermodynamic changes of RNA
secondary structures in response to base mutations.

Results: We have developed algorithms for computing the changes
of the ensemble free energy, mean energy and the thermodynamic
entropy of RNA secondary structures for exhaustive patterns of single
and double mutations. The computational complexities are (9(NW2)
(where N is sequence length and W is maximal base pair span)
for single mutations and (9(N2W2) for double mutations with large
constant factors. We show that the changes are relatively insensitive
to GO composition and the maximal span constraint. The mean
free energy changes are bounded ~7—9 kcal/mol and depend only
weakly on position if sequence lengths are sufficiently large. For tRNA
sequences, the most stabilizing mutations come from the change of
the 5’-most base of the anticodon loop. We also show that most
of the base changes in the acceptor stem destabilize the structures,
indicating that the nucleotide sequence in the acceptor stem is highly
optimized for secondary structure stability. We investigate the 22
tRNA genes in the human mitochondrial genome and show that
non-pathogenic polymorphisms tend to cause smaller changes in
thermodynamic variables than generic mutations, suggesting that
a mutation which largely increases thermodynamic variables has
higher possibility to be a pathogenic or lethal mutation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Measuring the effects of base mutations has long been a standard
method for studying relationships between structural RNAs and their
biological functions. Molecular biologists mutate some nucleotides
of the RNAs of interest in order to alter the structures, and
draw various conclusions by observing whether the mutations

disrupt biological functions [see, for example, (Warf et (11., 2009)].
Observing mutation patterns in genome evolution has also been
important for detecting evolutionarily conserved functional RNAs
and evolutionarily conserved structural RNAs show special types of
mutation patterns that preserve their secondary structures. Several
studies have used such patterns as a major feature for ﬁnding
novel structural RNAs from multiply aligned genomic sequences
(Knudsen and Hein, 2003; Pedersen et (11., 2004; Rivas and Eddy,
2001; Washietl et (11., 2005). Investigating the structural changes
due to base mutations has potentially important applications in
genome-wide association studies, where many disease-associated
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are located outside the
protein coding regions in the human genome (Halvorsen et (11.,
2010; International HapMap Consortium, 2005; Manolio, 2010).
It is possible that part of the disease associations of these
SNPs can be explained by altered structures of the non-coding
RNAs that are transcribed around those regions. Despite the
widespread use of mutational analyses and the potential relevance
to human diseases, very few studies have developed methods for
systematically computing the changes in RNA secondary structures
in response to base mutations (Barash and Churkin, 2011; Churkin
and Barash, 2006, 2008; Shu et (11., 2006; Waldispuhl et (11.,
2008, 2009).

In our previous paper, we have developed algorithms for
computing the thermodynamic variables for a given sequence
(Kiryu and Asai, submitted for publication) [see also the earlier
works (Clote et (11., 2005; Miklos et (11., 2005) which developed
algorithms for the mean free energy computation]. In this article,
we present algorithms for computing the changes in the ensemble
free energy, mean free energy and the thermodynamic entropy of
secondary structures for all the possible single and double mutations,
assuming that the RNA secondary structures follow the Boltzmann
distribution P(;’|x) of the Turner energy model (TEM) (Mathews
et (11., 1999):

P(§Ix)=exp(—AG(;x)/RT)/Z(x)
Z(x)=Z{EQeXp(—E(§,x)/RT)

where AG(;’,x)(kcal/mol) represents the difference of the Gibbs
energies G(;’,x) — G(;’0,x) between a structure g“ and the structure {0
that contains no base pairs, S2 is the set of all possible secondary
structures of x, R: 1.9872 x 10—3 kcal/(mol-K) is the gas constant
and T: 310.15 K is the temperature.

Since it is known that the secondary structure model based on the
Turner energy parameters is less accurate for predicting secondary

structures of long RNA sequences (Mathews et (11., 1999) and
the base pair predictions between distant nucleotide positions are
particularly inaccurate for such long RNAs (Doshi et (11., 2004),
it is natural to restrict the maximal span of the base pairs to
a ﬁxed value W. The maximal span constraint avoids predicting
large number of spurious base pairs between distant positions while
still allowing global structure prediction. When the maximal span
constraint is applied, S2 includes only structures containing base
pairs of span 3 W.

Using the thermodynamic model, the mean free energy U (x) and
the macroscopic entropy S (x) in energy units are deﬁned by

soc):—RT:;EQP(;ix>Iog(P(;ix» (1)
U(x>= ZP(;Ix>AG(;x>
{e9

F(x) = —RTlog(Z(x)) = U(x) — S(x)

Here, U (x) is the mean free energy difference of RNA secondary
structure, F (x) is the ensemble free energy difference (G(x)—
G(;’0,x)) between the state of the secondary structure ensemble and
the unstructured state {0. Our algorithms compute the differences
dF(x*,x) =F(x*) —F(x), dU(x*,x) = U(x*)— U(x) and dS(x*,x)=
S(x*)—S(x) for all the possible single and double mutants x* of
sequence x. The computational complexities are (9(NW2) (where
N is sequence length and W is maximal base pair span) for single
mutations and (’)(N2 W2) for double mutations with large constant
factors.

RNAmute (Churkin and Barash, 2006, 2008) computes the
minimum free energies and the structural changes for all the possible
single mutations by running the RNAfold program in the Vienna
RNA package (Hofacker, 2003) for each RNA mutant. RNAmute
can also compute k-point mutations that are likely to cause
large structural alterations by using the RNAsubopt and RNAfold
programs of the Vienna package. The computational complexities
are (9(N4) for single mutations and (9(NeCN) (C > 0), which is the
complexity of RNAsubopt, for k-point mutations. RDMAS (Shu
et (11., 2006) also uses RNAsubopt and RNAfold to predict the
most deleterious single mutations that cause large structural changes.
They compute suboptimal structures l"(x*) within a ﬁxed range of
free energy for each of 3N possible single point mutants x* and
returns ‘deleteriousness’ D(;’MFE(x)F(x*)) deﬁned by a Boltzmann
average of structural distances d(;’1,;’2):

D(;MFE(x>.r(x*>>= Z P<§Ix>d(;MFE(x>,;*>
4* el“(x*)

€MFE(X) = argmingengGJ)

where {MFE(x) is the minimum free energy (MFE) structure
of the original sequence x. RDMAS provide a few options for
the distance measure d(;’, §*) including free energy difference
|E(;’,x) —E(;’* ,x*)|, edit distance between secondary structures, and
difference between topological indices of secondary structures. The
complexity for this procedure is (9(NeCN). Since both RNAmute
and RDMAS use either MFE structures or suboptimal structures of
a ﬁxed energy range, they do not take into account all the possible
secondary structures. On the other hand, our algorithm exactly
sums the contributions from all the possible secondary structures
in a polynomial time. RNAmutants (Waldispuhl et (11., 2008, 2009)
calculates all the k-point mutant partition functions Zk (x) (for k f K

with a given K) which are given by the sum of all the Boltzmann
factors of all the possible k-point mutants:

Zko‘):Zx*eM(k,x)defzexp(_E(;x*)/RT)

= Zx" EM(k,x)Z(x*)

where M(k,x) is the set of all the k-point mutants of sequence x. The
complexity for computing the partition ﬁinctions is (9(K2N3). While
we are generally interested in the individual effects of each mutation
x*, k-point partition ﬁinctions Zk (x) mix up all the contributions of
the k-point mutants x* and it is not possible to extract individual
partition ﬁinctions Z(x*) from Zk (x) with any simple modiﬁcation
to the RNAmutants algorithm. In their paper, the authors used a
statistical sampling method that samples mutated sequences x* with
structures from the k-point Boltzmann distribution associated with
Zk (x). However, the meaning of the sampled sequences is difﬁcult
to understand from the statistical physics viewpoint; it is equivalent
to a thermodynamic system where time scales of base mutations are
as fast as those of RNA folding. Furthermore, sampling methods are
very inefﬁcient for long RNA sequences with large structure spaces
(Kiryu et (11., 2011). On the other hand our algorithm exhaustively
computes the individual partition ﬁinctions Z(x*) of all the k = 1,2
points mutants x*. Finally, none of those studies have computed
the differences of thermodynamic quantities such as the ensemble
free energy, mean free energy and entropy for each individual
mutation.

In the following sections, we ﬁrst derive our algorithms for a
simple stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG). Next we derive
similar algorithms for the more complex case in which the emission
probabilities depend on the neighboring bases; this mimics the
complexities encountered in the energy model. We then describe
how to extend the algorithms in these simple cases to the ﬁill energy
model. In Section 4, we show the run time and required memory size
for several parameter settings. We then investigate basic properties
of the thermodynamic changes, such as the dependencies on the
sequence lengths and the GC compositions, and the choices of the
maximal base pair span. We also investigate the dependencies of
the thermodynamic changes on the mutated base positions. Finally,
we investigate the characteristics of the thermodynamic changes of
the tRNA family.

2 ALGORITHMS AND IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Simple stochastic context-free grammar
The SCFG model that we consider has a single non-terminal state (S) and
ﬁve transition rules (P, L, R, B, E).

P : S —> a<Sa>

L :S —> aS

R : S —> Sa

B : S —> SS

E : S —> e
where (a<, 61>) represents a base pair, (1 represents an unpaired base and 6
represents a null terminal symbol. Although this grammar is an ambiguous
grammar, we can still deﬁne and compute the partition function Z0(x)=
ZEPOC, S) and entropy S0(x) = — ZEP(§|x)logP(§|x), where the sum is over

all the possible parse trees E. If a grammar is unambiguous, then the space of
the parse trees has one to one correspondence to the space of the secondary

Rchange: computing energy changes for RNA secondary structures

mutated, we decompose the tree into the inside part (i), the outside part (ii)
and the transition that emits the mutating base (iii).

structures and the corresponding probability distribution is deﬁned over the
secondary structure space. Although our implementation ‘Rchange’ uses
an unambiguous grammar called the Rfold grammar (see below and the
Supplementary Material), the following algorithm works independently of
the ambiguity of grammars. To compute the entropy of a single mutant for this
model, we must ﬁrst compute the partition function of the mutated sequence.
If the emission probabilities 0p(a< ,a>), 0L(a) and 0L(a) are independent of
the neighboring bases, as is usually the case, then the partition function can
easily be computed. For example, we consider a mutant x* in which the
original base xj at position j is replaced with base 0* (Fig. 1). To compute
the partition function Z(x*), we sum the probabilities P(x,g‘) over all the
parse trees 4“. Each parse tree contains exactly one transition that emits base
0* at position j, and we split the parse tree into two parts that are upstream
and downstream of the transition. These partial parse trees are independent of
the base at j, hence they also appear in the original sequence x. By collecting
these partial parse trees and reorganizing the sum using the inside and outside
variables, we obtain the formula

where [(r) represents the transition probability associated with transition
rule r, 0* represents the mutated base, and ot(u,v) and ﬁ(u,v) (11 iv)
represent the inside and outside variables of the original sequence x
(Fig. 2). The computational complexity of this calculation is (9(N). Hence,
the computation of all the single mutations (O(N)) is dominated by the
insideioutside algorithms and the total complexity is (9(N3).

In our previous paper, we developed a method to calculate the entropy,
the mean free energy, and the energy variance of secondary structures by
using dynamic programming (DP) algorithms (Kiryu and Asaj, submitted for
publication). Brieﬂy, we introduced copies of the inside variables, 01 1(1 , j).
[These were denoted by 01’ (i , j) in the previous paper but that symbol has a
different meaning in this article] These copies represent sums of tree scores
as in the ordinary inside variables except that each parse tree score contains a
single log transition score insertion [such as log(0p(0, 0’)t(P)), log(0L(0)t(L)),
etc.] at some transition. As there is no temperature for SCFG models, we use
a deﬁnition of entropy that is slightly different from Equation (1): the entropy
S(x)=—Z{P({|x)logP({|x) is given by —(Z1(x)/Z(x))+logZ(x), where
Z1(x)=o11(1,N) [for a detailed explanation see (Kiryu and Asai, submitted

for publication)]. In the present case, we compute Z1(x*) for each single-
point mutant x* by using a1(i,j) and ﬁ1(i,j) (which are log-score inserted
outside variables analogous to a1(i,j)):

t(R)[log0R(a)t(R)]V. The entropy of the mutated sequence is given by
S(x*)= —(Z1(x*)/Z(x*))+logZ(x*). Once the partition function Z(x*) and
entropy S(x*) are known the ensemble free energy F (x*) and mean free
energy U(x*) can be computed using Equation (1).

We next consider the computation of the partition function Z(x**) for a
double mutant x** in which bases 1' and j (i < j) are replaced with 0** and 0*,
respectively. To compute Z(x**), we simply replace the original sequence
x with x* and compute the inside and outside variables, o/(Lj) and ﬁ’(i,j),
for sequence x* and apply Equation (2) for the partition function of double
mutant x** with the replacements x*,j,0*,oz,ﬁ—>x**,i,0**,o/,ﬁ’. We can
economize the calculation of 01’ and 13’ by using the fact that parts of the
inside and outside variables of sequence x* are the same as the corresponding
variables of sequence x. In Figure 3, the inside and outside variables ofx* are
the same as those of x in regions (bw) and (a), respectively. Furthermore,
it is unnecessary to compute the outside variables of x* in region (b) to
compute Z(x**) for an arbitrary i (i < j). The computational complexity is
(9(N4) since we have to apply the outside algorithm [which has complexity
(9(N3)] to 3N single mutations, where N is the input sequence length. Note
that there are three possible l-point mutations for each base. For example,
A—> C. A—> G and A—> U are the possible mutations for base A.

which depend on pairs of bases (01 ,02) outside of the parsing subsequences.

2.2 Emission probabilities dependent on neighboring
bases

We now consider the case in which the emission probabilities depend on
the neighboring bases: 0p(xi,xj lxi_1,xi+1,xj_1,xj+1), 0L(xi|xi_1,xi+1) and
0R(xi|xi_1,xi+1). Although such a model does not belong to the category of
generative models, it approximates the essential complexities of the energy
model. In such a case, the value of the inside variable 01(1, j) computed
for the original sequence x depends on the bases xi_1 and 194. 1, unlike in
the previous subsection. Similarly, the outside variable 13(1 , j) depends on
xi and xj. We cannot apply Equation (2) since the mutation at position j
alters the values of the neighboring inside and outside variables. It is in
principle possible to derive a formula similar to Equation (2) that uses only
the inside and outside variables which are two bases away from position
j and hence are independent of the mutation of the base at j. However,
the corresponding formula would be much more complicated since it would
include three layers of DP recursions, corresponding to the emissions of bases
xj_1, x]- and xj+ 1. Instead, we introduce seven copies of the inside variables
01(1 , j , (0 1 , 02)), where (01 , 02) represents one of seven types of nucleotide pairs
at positions (1' — 1, j+ 1) that differ by at most one base from the original
nucleotide sequence. For example, if (xi_1, 194. 1) = (A,G) as in Figure 4,
then (01 ,02) is one of the set {(A,G),(A,U),(A,A),(A.C).(C.G).(G.G).(U.G)}.
Then 01(1, j ,(01 ,02)) is deﬁned to be the inside variable on the condition that
the bases at i — 1 and j + 1 are 01 and 02, respectively. Similarly, we introduce
seven copies of the outside variables 13(1 , j , (0 1 ,02)), where (01 ,02) represents
one of seven types of nucleotide pairs at positions (1', j) that differ by at most
one base from the original bases. Accordingly, 13(1 , j , (0 1 ,02)) is deﬁned to be
the outside variable on the condition that the bases at i and j are 01 and 02,
respectively. Once these variables are calculated, we can apply Equation 2
by choosing the appropriate 01(1 , j,(0 1 ,02)) and 13(1 , j,(0 1,02)) depending on

the mutated base.

ot(i,j,(01,02)) and ﬁ(i,j,(01,02)) are computed by the usual insideioutside
algorithms with special care taken to match the outside nucleotide pairs
(01,02). For example, the inside algorithm is

The outside algorithm is similar to the inside algorithm and is shown in

outside algorithms is simply seven times larger than that of the usual insidei
outside algorithms and is given by (9(N3).

2.3 Application to the energy model

We use the grammatical formulation called the Rfold model, which was
introduced in (Kiryu at 011., 2008), to derive the mean free energy and the
entropy differences for TEM. The Rfold model is based on an unambiguous
grammar that can generate all the secondary structures without duplication,
and its transition rules are capable of accommodating the score system
of TEM. The unambiguity of the Rfold grammar is described in detail in
the Supplementary Material of the original article and we do not repeat it
here (Kiryu 01 011., 2008). The model fully uses the advantage provided by
the maximal span constraint and computes the insidemutside algorithms in
(9(NW2) time and (9(N + W2) space (where N is sequence length, and W is
the maximal span of base pairs). Although the Rfold model is not an SCFG
model, it is usually straightforward to derive DP algorithms analogous to
those in SCFG models (Kiryu at 011., 2008, 2011; Kiryu and Asai, submitted
for publication).

In the insidemutside algorithms of the Rfold model, the dangle and
terminal mismatch energies of TEM (Zuker at 011., 1999) correspond to
dependencies on nucleotides outside of the DP cells. Fortunately, these
dependencies do not extend >1 base on either side of the current DP cell.
Therefore, we only need six additional DP matrices, just as described in
the previous section, to accommodate arbitrary single-point mutations of
DP cells that are immediately outside of the current cell. To compute the
entropy and mean free energy, we double the DP matrices for computing the
log-score inserted tree scores. Consequently, the memory size required for
the DP matrices in the case of single-point mutations is 14 times as large
as that in the usual insidemutside algorithms, although the complexities
are the same O(N+W2) (Kiryu at 011., 2008). In the case of double-
point mutations, we use O(N+LW2) memory (where L is the maximal
distance of mutated base pairs) to keep track of the mutant insideioutside
variables 01’, 13’. The computation times are dominated by the bifurcation
calculations and there are 7 X 3 :21 times as many of those as there
are in the ordinary insidewutside algorithm. The factor of 7 corresponds
the number of nucleotide pairs (01,02) for computing the insideioutside
variables ot(i,j,(01 ,02)) and ﬁ(i,j,(01,02)), and 3 corresponds to the patterns
of bifurcations that mix log-score inserted DP matrices: 2k 01,,(1', k)-01V(k,j),
Zkau0,k)-ﬁv(i,k) and Zkau(k,i)-ﬁv(k,j) (for u+v51). Despite this, the

computational complexity is still (9(NW2) for single-point mutations, and
(9(NW2L) for double-point mutations. We have described the full algorithm
in the Supplementary Material.

We have implemented the algorithms in C++ in a software package called
‘Rchange’. The source code is freely available from our download site
(http://www.ncrna.org/software/rchange/).

3 DATASET AND DATA PROCESSING

We measured the run time and memory usage for random RNA sequences.
The experiments were performed on a PC with an Intel Quad Core Xeon
E5450 3.0 GHz processor and 32 GB of memory. Random RNA sequences
of varying lengths and GC compositions were generated using a Ruby script.
The tRNA sequences are taken from the Rfam database version 10 (Grifﬁths-
Jones at 011., 2003). We used only the manually curated seed alignment of
967 sequences and its accompanying structure annotation.

We have obtained non-pathogenic polymorphisms and pathogenic
mutations from MITOMAP (Ruiz-Pesini 01 011., 2007). The non-pathogenic
polymorphism are considered as mutations from the reference genome,
which can be regarded as a collection of dominant alleles (Ruiz-Pesini 01 011.,
2007). The background distributions of dF/lFl, dU/lUl and dS/lSl (sample
size n=4142 for each) are deﬁned by the distributions for all the possible
single-point mutations in the 22 mitochondrial tRNA genes except the non-
pathogenic polymorphisms (n = 238) and the pathogenic mutations (n = 209)
of MITOMAP.

In our previous work (Kiryu and Asai, submitted for publication), we have
shown that the scales of mean energies U(x) are generally about 10 times
higher than S(x). It means F (x): U(x)—S(x) and U (x) are well correlated.
Consistently with this ﬁnding, we found (1F =dU —dS and (1U are very well
correlated. Therefore, we only show the ﬁgures for (1U in the following
section. We have shown the comparison between (1F =dU —dS and (1U in
the Supplementary Material.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Comparison of run time and memory usage

Table 1 shows the run time and memory usage of the Rchange
program. As described earlier, Rchange is at least 21 times slower
than the usual inside—outside algorithms. The table shows that it
is difﬁcult to apply Rchange to genome scale sequences. Because
of the complexities of the algorithm, the optimization level of our
implementation is rather primitive at present. The run time can be
improved by devising data structures and orders of computations,
though it will require a considerable work. We would like to leave

more elaborate optimization to make Rchange a faster program to
the future.

4.2 Scales of mean free energy and entropy changes

Figure 5 shows the effects of single-point mutations on the mean
free energies U and the entropies S. For each random sequence
generated with a speciﬁed length and GC composition, we ran
Rchange to obtain the differences dU and (1S for all the single-
point mutations and we selected the largest and smallest values
from these 3N difference values. We plotted the mean values of
these upper and lower bounds for 100 random sequences with the
same length and GC composition. The upper bound values indicate
the largest energy or entropy increase caused by a single mutation;
the lower bound indicates the largest energy or entropy decrease
caused by a single mutation. These four ﬁgures show that the effect
of varying GC compositions or maximal spans W do not have
much inﬂuence on the differences. The mean free energy change
dU (Fig. 5A and B) reaches a bound of 7—9 kcal/mol in magnitude
at around N =200, while the entropy change (1S (Fig. 5C and D)
gradually increases in magnitude as the sequence length increases.
Interestingly, the magnitudes of the entropy changes are about half of
those of the mean free energies, which is a much higher ratio than the
typical ratio (about one-tenth) for the total entropies and mean free
energies (Kiryu and Asai, submitted for publication). This indicates
that the entropy changes might affect in the in viva processes of
mutations (such as RNA editing) on RNA transcripts. Since the
dynamic range of single point mutations are bounded independently
of the sequence length, base mutations have considerable impact
on the thermodynamics of less stable RNAs. As the thermodynamic
variables F, U and S roughly proportional to the sequence length
(Kiryu and Asai, submitted for publication), smaller RNAs are

‘Enrichment’ indicates how often each speciﬁc mutation caused the maximal change
of U and S, compared with the background frequency. ‘Mean change’ is the average

more inﬂuenced by the mutations. We have analyzed the effects of
single point mutations on other Rfam families such as microRNAs
(let-7) and snoRNAs (SNORAl, SNORD73) in the Supplementary
Material. We have shown that any mutation to the stems of the
stable RNAs (let-7 and SNORAl) generally causes a increase of
energies whereas less stable RNAs have a large number of stabilizing
mutations, implying selective pressures for the secondary structure
stability vary considerably from family to family.

Table 2 shows a ranked list of the mutation patterns that
were frequently observed to cause the maximal changes of the
thermodynamic values U and S in the random sequences. We
computed the mutation patterns that caused the maximal changes
of U and S for each sequence, and counted the number of
occurrences for 100 random sequences. We ranked the patterns
by the enrichment—the ratio of the frequency of occurrence
of pattern 01—>02 to a simple background frequency given by
{(total count of 01 in all the sequences) X 1/4}. The table indicates
the maximal increases are achieved by mutating G to the
other bases in many cases and the maximal decreases of the
thermodynamic values are achieved by mutating a base into G.
We have shown nucleotide dependencies and structural preferences
of the thermodynamic change distributions in the Supplementary
Material.

4.3 Position dependence of mean free energy changes

Figure 6 shows the position dependence of dU. For each position
of random sequences of lengths 20 (A, C) and 200 (B, D), we
obtain the upper and lower bound for energy changes. Figure 6A
and B show the mean values of these upper and lower bounds
for 10000 random samples. Figure 6C and D show the stande
deviations (SDs) of (1U for each position calculated from the 10 000
random sequences. For shorter sequences (A, C), we observe two
peaks around positions 5 and 15 which indicate the dominance of
single hairpin structures over other structural conﬁgurations in short
sequences. This position dependence rapidly disappears as sequence
length increases, and we ﬁnd no position dependence except the
very small values of d U s at the ends of sequences (B, D). Figure 6B

is ~ 2kcal/mol, indicating the strong sequence dependence of the
energy changes.

4.4 Effects of single-point mutations on tRNA

Figure 7 shows the position dependence of the upper and lower
bounds of the relative changes dU/IUI and (1S /S for single-point
mutations of tRNA sequences. For each position of each tRNA
sequence in the Rfam seed alignment, we calculated the upper
bound and bound of dU/IUI and (1S /S . The average values of
these bounds are plotted for all the seed sequences using the
alignment information. We removed alignment columns with many
gaps (> 30% of the number of the sequences). The ﬁgure shows that
mutations in the stem regions can destabilize the structure more
than those in non-stem regions. Mutations in the acceptor stem
(the closing stem) inﬂuence the increase of dU / | U | the most, and
a change of >20% of the mean free energy can be produced by
only a single mutation. On the other hand, the increase of (1S /S
is most affected by the T arm (the right most stem aside from the
acceptor stem) on average, which might indicate that an increased
probability of disruption of the T arm stem may lead to a large
ﬂuctuation of these regions, including the variable loop between
the anticodon stem and the T arm stem; however, the differences
from the peaks of the other stems are small. The plots of the lower
bounds show sharp peaks at the unpaired bases that are next to
the stem regions, which indicates that changes that extend the stem
length stabilize the secondary structure the most. The upper ﬁgure
shows that the secondary structures are most stabilized by changing
the 5’ end of the anticodon loop (the loop in the center stem). This
ﬁgure also shows that any changes in the acceptor stem increase

the mean free energy, which indicates that the sequences of the
acceptor stem may be strongly optimized for secondary structure
stability.

4.5 Effects of double-point mutations on tRNA

Figure 8 shows the position dependence of the upper and lower
bounds of the relative changes dU/ |U| and (1S /S for double-point
mutants of tRNA sequences. The upper right triangles show that the
largest increases of dU / | U | and (1S /S can be obtained by mutating
nucleotide pairs that are both located in the stem regions. The
destabilizing effects on U are larger if one mutating base is on
the acceptor stem than if both nucleotides are on mean free stems,
while the inﬂuence on entropies S is similar regardless of which
stem regions the pairs are located in. The lower bound of dU / | U |
(the lower left triangle in Fig. 8A) shows that the double mutation
of a base at a stem boundary and a base in a loop region can cause
>30% decrease of the mean energy. On the other hand, most of the
double mutations that include any base in the acceptor stem increase
dU. There are no dU >0 regions (or green regions in the lower
left triangles) inside the acceptor stem, even at the intersections of

bound of dU/ |U| or dS / S for all the non-trivial double-point mutations. We
have averaged the upper bounds and the lower bounds over the 967 tRNA
sequences using the seed alignment of the Rfam database. The positive and
negative changes are displayed using green and magenta colors, respectively.

different stem regions in which any double mutations are expected
to destabilize both of the stem structures. This indicates that the
D arm, anticodon and T arm stems are not very stable compared
with the acceptor stem and there are considerable ﬂuctuations in
their secondary structures. At present, it is not clear whether this
represents biophysical properties of tRNAs or is simply a limitation
of TEM.

4.6 Mutations in human mitochondrial tRNAs

The human mitochondrial genome involves 22 tRNA genes.
Mitochondrial DNA is known to have about 10 times higher
mutation rate than nuclear DNA, and the mutations in the tRNA
genes cause various mitochondrial diseases such as myopathy,
deafness and Alzheimer’s disease (Zifa et (11., 2007). We compared
the distributions of dF/lFl, dU / | U | and (1S / S for non-pathogenic
polymorphisms and pathogenic mutations with the background
distribution. Figure 9 shows the (1S / S distribution for three mutation
types. It shows that non-pathogenic polymorphisms are depleted

from the large (1S /S region and concentrated around (1S /S=0
as compared with the background mutations. Table 3 shows the
P-values that test the biases of the distributions. We do not ﬁnd any
signiﬁcant bias for the pathogenic mutations. It is reasonable since
the seriousness of symptoms vary widely from disease to disease
and the carriers of pathogenic mutations are still viable with all
their sickness as opposed to the cases of lethal mutations, which
may obscure the relationships between the tRNA ﬁinctions and
the pathogenic mutations. On the other hand, the non-pathogenic
polymorphisms tend to cause smaller changes, suggesting that a
mutation that largely increases either (1S /S , dU / | U | or (1F / IF I tends
to be a pathogenic or lethal mutation. It is interesting that entropy
change (1S /S has greater signiﬁcance than the energy changes
dU/IUI and (IF/|F|, which might indicates that the structural
ﬂuctuations are more related to tRNA dysﬁinction than the energetic
instabilities.

5 CONCLUSION

In this article, we have developed algorithms for computing
changes in the ensemble free energy, mean free energy and
the thermodynamic entropy of RNA secondary structures for all
possible patterns of single and double mutations. The computational
complexities are (9(NW2) (where N is sequence length and W is
maximal base pair span) for single mutations and (9(N2W2) for
double mutations with relatively large constant factors. We have

shown that the changes in the mean free energy and entropy
are relatively insensitive to GC composition and the maximal
span constraint. The mean energy changes are bounded at ~7—
9kcal/mol in magnitude and there is only a small position
dependence if sequence lengths are sufﬁciently large. For tRNA
sequences, the most stabilizing mutations come from changes of
the 5’-most base of the anticodon loop. We have also shown
that most base changes in the acceptor stem destabilize the
structures, indicating that the nucleotide sequence in the acceptor
stem is highly optimized for secondary structure stability. We
have analyzed the effects of single point mutations on other Rfam
families such as microRNAs (let-7) and snoRNAs (SNORAl,
SNORD73) in the Supplementary Material, where we have shown
that any mutation to the stems of stable RNAs generally causes
a increase of energies whereas less stable RNAs have stabilizing
mutations in most regions, implying selective pressures for the
secondary structure stability vary considerably from family to
family. We have investigated human mitochondrial tRNAs and
found that non-pathogenic polymorphisms tend to cause smaller
changes in thermodynamic variables as compared with a background
distribution, suggesting that a mutation which largely increases
thermodynamic variables has higher possibility to be a pathogenic
or lethal mutation.

There are several applications of our algorithms. As described in
the Introduction, our algorithms can be directly used in a mutation
analysis to design the most stabilizing and destabilizing mutations.
They will also be useful for investigating the correlations between
the evolutionary variations of RNA genes in genome sequences and
the changes in their structures. The algorithms can also be of interest
for investigating the disease associations of SNPs located in non-
coding RNA genes. Although we only considered mutations within
the stande four bases ‘ACGU’ in this article, similar techniques
will be used for the structural analysis of A-to-I RNA editing if there
exists a complete set of nearest-neighbor parameters for the inosine
residue [see Watkins and SantaLucia (2005) for DNA case].

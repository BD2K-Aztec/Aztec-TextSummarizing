ABSTRACT

Motivation: There are a number of well-established methods such as
principal component analysis (PCA) for automatically capturing sys-
tematic variation due to latent variables in large-scale genomic data.
PCA and related methods may directly provide a quantitative charac-
terization of a complex biological variable that is otherwise difficult to
precisely define or model. An unsolved problem in this context is how
to systematically identify the genomic variables that are drivers of
systematic variation captured by PCA. Principal components (PCs)
(and other estimates of systematic variation) are directly constructed
from the genomic variables themselves, making measures of statistical
significance artificially inflated when using conventional methods due
to over-fitting.

Results: We introduce a new approach called the jackstraw that
allows one to accurately identify genomic variables that are statistically
significantly associated with any subset or linear combination of PCs.
The proposed method can greatly simplify complex significance test-
ing problems encountered in genomics and can be used to identify the
genomic variables significantly associated with latent variables. Using
simulation, we demonstrate that our method attains accurate meas-
ures of statistical significance over a range of relevant scenarios. We
consider yeast cell-cycle gene expression data, and show that the
proposed method can be used to straightforwardly identify genes
that are cell-cycle regulated with an accurate measure of statistical
significance. We also analyze gene expression data from post-trau ma
patients, allowing the gene expression data to provide a molecularly
driven phenotype. Using our method, we find a greater enrichment for
inflammatory-related gene sets compared to the original analysis that
uses a clinically defined, although likely imprecise, phenotype. The
proposed method provides a useful bridge between large-scale quan-
tifications of systematic variation and gene-level significance analyses.
Availability and implementation: An R software package, called
jackstraw, is available in CRAN.

1 INTRODUCTION

Latent variable models play an important role in understanding
variation in genomic data (Leek and Storey, 2007; Price et al.,
2006). They are particularly useful for characterizing systematic
variation in genomic data whose variable representation is

unobserved or imprecisely known (Fig. 1). Principal component
analysis (PCA) has proven to be an especially informative
method for capturing quantitative signatures of latent variables
in genomic data, and it is in widespread use across a range of
applications. For example, PCA has been successfully applied to
uncover the systematic variation in gene expression (Alter et al.,
2000; Holter et al., 2000; Raychaudhuri et al., 2000), estimate
structure in population genetics (Price et al., 2006; Zhu et al.,
2002), and account for dependence in multiple hypothesis testing
(Leek and Storey, 2007, 2008). Generally, principal components
(PCs) can be thought of as estimates of unobserved manifest-
ation of latent variables; they are constructed by aggregating
variation across thousands or more genomic variables (Jolliffe,
2002). What is missing from this highly successful system is a
method to precisely identify which genomic variables are the
statistically signiﬁcant drivers of the PCs in genomic data,
which in turn identifies the genomic variables associated with
the unobserved latent variables.

In a typical application of PCA to genomic data, all variables
will have non-zero loadings, meaning that they all make some
contribution to the construction of PCs. We refer to genomic
variables as the high-dimensional variables considered in a gen-
omics study such as genes, array probe sets, or genetic loci. In
some cases, when many (or most) of these contributions are for-
cibly set to zero, similar PCs nevertheless emerge. Methods have
been proposed to induce sparsity in the loadings, for example,
with a lasso penalized PCA or a Bayesian prior (Engelhardt and
Stephens, 2010; J olliffe et al., 2003;Witten et al., 2009; Zou et al.,
2006). Methods have also been developed to consider uncertainty
in PCA expansions (Goldsmith et al., 2013). Various formula-
tions of statistical signiﬁcance have been considered previously in
the context of PCA. These have usually been focused on scen-
arios where the number of observations is substantially larger
than the number of variables, significance is measured in terms
of a completely unstructured data matrix where all variables are
mutually independent, or the goal is to only determine the
number of significant PCs (Anderson, 1963; Buja and
Eyuboglu, 1992; Girshick, 1939; Johnstone, 2001; Linting
et al., 2011; Peres-Neto et al., 2003; Tracy and Widom, 1996;
Timmerman et al., 2010). The problem we consider here differs
from those scenarios.

Our goal is not a minimal representation of a PCA; we would
like instead to develop a strategy that accurately identifies which
genomic variables are truly associated with systematic variation
of interest. This can be phrased in statistical terminology as de-
veloping a signiﬁcance test for associations between genomic

Fig. 1. Illustration of systematic variation genomic data due to latent
variables. Complex biological variables, such as clinical subtypes and
cell-cycle regulation, may be difﬁcult to deﬁne, measure, or model.
Instead, we can characterize the manifestation of latent variables, L(z),
directly from high-dimensional genomic data using PCA and related
methods. The proposed method calculates the statistical signiﬁcance of
associations between variables in Y and estimates of L, while accounting
for over-ﬁtting due to the fact that L must be estimated from Y

variables and a given set, subset, or linear combination of PCs
estimated from genomic data. We introduce a new resampling
approach, which we call the jackstraw, to rigorously identify the
genomic variables associated with PCs of interest, as well as sub-
sets and rotations of PCs of interest. Our approach is capable of
obtaining the empirical null distribution of association statistics
(e. g. F—statistics) and applying these to the observed association
statistics between genomic features and PCs to obtain valid stat-
istical signiﬁcance measures. Succinctly, new PCs are computed
from a dataset with a few independently permuted variables,
which become tractable ‘synthetic’ null variables. The association
statistics between newly computed PCs and synthetic null vari-
ables serve as empirical null statistics, accounting for the meas-
urement error and over-ﬁtting of PCA.

As an application, we consider the problem of identifying
genes whose expression is cell-cycle regulated. In this case,
there are infinitely many theoretical curves that would represent
‘cell-cycle regulation’ to the point where a standard statistical
analysis involves an unwieldy ‘composite null hypothesis’
(Lehmann, 1997). We identify the few realized patterns of cell-
cycle regulated gene expression through PCA and we are able to
directly test whether each gene is associated with these using the
proposed approach. As another application, we analyzed obser-
vational gene expression profiles of blunt-force trauma patients
(Desai et al., 2011), whose post-trauma inﬂammatory responses
are difﬁcult to be quantiﬁed using conventional means. When the
clinical phenotype of interest cannot be precisely measured and
modeled, we may estimate it directly from genomic data itself.
We identify genes driving systematic variation in gene expression
of post-trauma patients and demonstrate that our analysis is
biologically richer than the original analysis (Desai et al., 2011).

PCA has direct connections to independent component ana-
lysis (ICA; Hastie et al., 2011) and K-means clustering (Ding and

He, 2004; Zha et al., 2001). Therefore, the methods we propose
are likely applicable to those models as well. Furthermore, this
approach has potential generalizations to a much broader class
of clustering and latent variable methods that all seek to capture
systematic variation.

2 STATISTICAL MODEL AND APPROACH

Consider an m x n row-wise mean-centered expression data
matrix Y with m observed variables measured over n observa-
tions (m >> n). Y may contain systematic variation across the
variables from an arbitrarily complex function of latent variables
z. We may calculate the expected inﬂuence of the latent variables
on Y by E[Y|z], and then write Y = E[Y|z] + E, where E is deﬁned
as Y — E[Y|z]. There exists a r x n matrix, called L(z), that is a
row basis for E[Y|z], where r 5 n (Leek and Storey, 2007, 2008).
This low-dimensional matrix L(z) can be thought of as the mani-
festation of the latent variables in the genomic data. As illu-
strated in Figure 1, this conditional factor model is common
for biomedical and genomic data (Leek, 2010). Since z is never
directly observed or used in the model, we will abbreviate L(z) as
L. This yields the model

Y=BL+E (1)

where B is a m x r matrix of unknown parameters of interest.
The 11h row of B, which we write as b,, quantiﬁes the relationship
between the latent variable basis L and genomic variable y,. This
model (1) is schematized in Supplementary Material, Figure S1.

The PCs of Y may be calculated by taking the singular value
decomposition (SVD) of Y. This yields Y =UDVT where U is a
m x n orthonormal matrix, D is a n x n diagonal matrix and V is
a n x n orthonormal matrix. The diagonal elements in D are the n
singular values, which are in a decreasing order of magnitude.
The rows of VT are the right singular vectors, with corresponding
singular values in D. PCs are then the rows of DVT, where the i‘h
PC is found in the 11h row of DVT. The columns of U are con-
sidered to be the loadings of their respective PCs.

Suppose that the row-space of L has dimension r. The top r
PCs may then be used to estimate the row basis for L (J olliffe,
2002). Speciﬁcally, under a mild set of assumptions, it has been
shown that as m —> co, the top r PCs of Y converge with prob-
ability 1 to a matrix whose row space is equivalent to that of L
(Leek, 2010). For our estimation purposes, we only need to con-
sider the VT matrix since this captures the row-space. We would
therefore estimate L by simply obtaining the top r right singular
vectors, which we denote by V,.T.

Let’s now consider a concrete example of z, L, VT, and the
ultimate inference goal. Spellman et a]. (1998) carried out a gene
expression study to identify cell-cycle regulated genes of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fig. 2). In this experiment, m = 5981
genes’ expression values were originally measured over n = 14
time points in a culture of yeast cells whose cell cycles had
been synchronized. (Note that an inspection of the 14 micro-
arrays from Spellman et a]. (1998) reveals an aberrant gene ex-
pression proﬁle from 300—min, so we removed this array in our
analysiSﬂee Supplementary Figure S2.) Here, z is the latent
variable that represents the dynamic gene expression regulatory
program over the yeast cell cycle. L is the manifested inﬂuence of

Hierarchical clustering was applied to this subset of 2998 genes

z on the observed scale of gene expression measurements
(Fig. 1). The ordered time points themselves do not capture the
underlying cell-cycle regulation, and it is, therefore, not clear
how to a priori accurately model L. If L were directly observed,
then we could identify which genes are cell-cycle regulated by
performing a signiﬁcance test of H0 :b,-=0 versus H1 :b,-=0
for each gene 1'.

However, since L is not observed, we can instead perform the
analogous association test using V,.T. Figure 2(a) shows the ﬁrst
two PCs of Y, where it can be seen that these capture systematic
variation that resembles cell-cycle regulation. (It should be noted
that the remaining PCs, three and higher, do not appear to
capture systematic variation of interest.) Since the row-spaces
of L and V? (r = 2) are theoretically close (Leek, 2010), we
can instead use the model

Y=rV,T+E’, (2)

where F is a m x r matrix of unknown coefﬁcients. We would
then perform a signiﬁcance test of H0 : yi =0 versus H1 : 71 75 0
for each gene 1'.

Note that if V? —> L in row-space as m —> 00, then these two
hypothesis tests would be asymptotically (in the number of vari-
ables) equivalent. However, for ﬁxed m, they are not equivalent.
There are two main issues: (i) V? is a noisy estimate of L; (ii) V?
is itself a function of Y, so hypothesis testing on Y=l"V,,T +E/
results in an anti-conservative bias due to overﬁtting. Our pro-
posed method deals with problem (ii) by accounting for the over-
ﬁtting that is intrinsic to performing hypothesis testing on model
(2). The numerical results in this article are carried out so that we
generate the data from model (1) and evaluate the accuracy of
the signiﬁcance based on the truth from model (1). Therefore,
our thorough simulations provide evidence that the proposed
method accounts for both issues (i) and (ii).

3 PROPOSED ALGORITHMS

We have developed a resampling method (Fig. 3) to obtain accurate
statistical signiﬁcance measures of the associations between
observed variables and their PCs, accounting for the over-ﬁtting
characteristics due to computation of PCs from the same set of
observed variables. The proposed algorithm replaces a small
number s (s << m) of observed variables with independently per-
muted ‘synthetic’ null variables, while preserving the overall system-
atic variation in the data. Note that the jackstraw disrupts the
systematic variation among the randomly chosen 3 rows by apply-
ing independently generated permutation mappings. We denote the
new matrix with the s synthetic null variables replacing their original
values as anxn. This is simply the original matrix Y with the 3 rows
of Y replaced by independently permuted versions. On each per-
mutation dataset Y*, we calculate association statistics for each
synthetic null variable, exactly as was done on the original data.
We carry this out B times, effectively creating B sets of permutation
statistics. The association statistics calculated on Y are then com-
pared to the association statistics calculated on only the s synthetic
null rows of Y* to obtain statistical signiﬁcance measures.

 

Algorithm to Calculate Signiﬁcance of Variables Associated with PCs

 

1. Obtain r PCs of interest, V? by applying SVD to the row-
wise mean-centered matrix men =UDVT.

2. Calculate m observed F—statistics F1, . . . , Fm, testing H0

null rows of Y* as in step 2, where V,.T is replaced with

8. Identify statistically signiﬁcant tests based on the P values

We call this approach the jackstraw for the following reason. By
permuting a relatively small amount of observed variables in the
original matrix, the underlying systematic variation due to latent
variables is preserved as a whole. This makes the PCs of Y*
almost identical to the PCs of the original data, Y, up to vari-
ation due to over-fitting of the noise. Replacing 3 variables with
null versions is reminiscent of the game of jackstraws where the
goal is to remove one stick at a time from a structured set of
sticks without disrupting the overall structure of the sticks. Since
the overall structure of Y is preserved in Y*, we know that the
level of associations between these synthetic null variables and

Fig. 3. A schematic of the general steps of the proposed algorithm to
calculate the statistical significance of associations between variables
(rows in Y) and their top r PCs (V,T). By independently permuting a
small number (s) of variables and recalculating the PCs, we generate
tractable “synthetic” null variables while preserving the overall systematic
variation. Association statistics between the s synthetic null variables in
Y* and VfT form the empirical null distribution, automatically taking
account over-ﬁtting intrinsic to testing for associations between a set of
observed variables and their PCs

the top r PCs is purely due to the over-ﬁtting nature of PCA.
From these synthetic null statistics, we can, therefore, capture
and adjust for the over-ﬁtting among the original statistics.

A balance between the number of resampling iterations B and
the number of synthetic null variables sis relevant to the speed of
the algorithm and the accuracy of the resulting P values. In each
resampling iteration, 3 determines the number of estimated null
statistics, so to get the same resolution of a particular empirical
null distribution (s x B total null statistics), B must increase pro-
portionally with a decreasing s. Suppose we fix the total number
of null statistics 3 x B that are generated (e.g. s x B= 10000).
One extreme is to set s = 1 and B = 10 000, where the accuracy
of the P values is maximized while the algorithm is the least
efﬁcient. However, setting 3 = 100 and B = 100 yields the same
number of null statistics; this conﬁguration would lead to a sav-
ings in computational time while it may result in slightly more
conservative P values. The number of true null variables in Y* is
always greater than or equal to the number of true null variables
in the original matrix Y. Therefore, an increase of s in the pro-
posed algorithm may lead to a greater over-ﬁtting into the noise
of Y* relative to the over-fitting in Y, resulting in conservative
estimates of signiﬁcance. Due to this favorable trade-off between
s and B, the proposed algorithm is guarded against anti-conser-
vative bias.

The hypothesis test H0 : yi =0 versus H1 : 71 75 0 applied to
model (2) may be generalized to performing the test on subspaces
spanned by the PCs, shown in Supplementary Material. This
generalization allows one to perform the association tests on a
subset of PCs, while adjusting for other PCs. It also allows for
one to consider rotations of V? and projections of V? onto rele-
vant subspaces. For example, it may be possible to rotate the PCs
to obtain ‘independent components’ from ICA (Hastie et al.,
2011) and then perform our algorithm on any desired subset of
the independent components. Note that when a subset of V? is
considered, the largest r eigenvalues corresponding to the top r
PCs must be sufﬁciently distinguished to ensure their stability
(Ng et al., 2001).

4 RESULTS

We evaluated the proposed method on simulated data so that
we could directly assess its accuracy, and we also applied the

method to two genomic datasets to demonstrate its utility in
practice.

4.1 Simulation studies

Through a set of simulation studies, we demonstrated that the
proposed method is able to accurately estimate the statistical
significance of associations between the latent variable basis L
and observed variables y,- (where i=1 ...m). The data in our
simulation studies were generated from model (1) Y=BL+E,
where variables y,- corresponding to bi=0 are, by deﬁnition,
the ‘null variables’ not associated with L (Supplementary Fig.
S1). The accuracy of our approach is evaluated by performing
m hypothesis tests using the proposed algorithm (where only Y is
observed) and assessing whether the joint distribution of P values
corresponding to the null variables is correctly behaved.

4.1.] The joint null criterion We used the ‘joint null criterion’ of
Leek and Storey (2011) to assess whether the set of P values
corresponding to the null variables follow the desired joint dis-
tribution (Supplementary Fig. S3). When testing a single hypoth-
esis, a valid procedure generates null P values that are distributed
uniformly between 0 and 1. For multiple hypothesis tests, the
goal is that the set of null P values produced by a method satis-
fies the joint null criterion, which means their joint distribution is
equivalent to a set of i.i.d. observations from the Uniform(0,1)
(Leek and Storey, 2011). Verifying that the proposed method
satisﬁes the joint null criterion not only demonstrates that the
method accounts for the over-ﬁtting inherent in methods such as
PCA, but also veriﬁes that our approach to calculating the P
value for each variable i is valid, which uses the set of sx B
synthetic null statistics that have been pooled across variables.
Leek and Storey (2011) prove that when the joint null criterion
holds, then a large body of multiple testing procedures (such as
the standard false discovery rate procedures) control their re-
spective error measure.

There are two ways in which we measured deviations from the
Uniform(0,1) joint null criterion. The ﬁrst is Via a two-sided
KolmogoroviSmirnov test (KS test), which detects any devi-
ation; the second is a one-sided KS test, which detects anti-con-
servative deviations where the null P values are skewed towards
zero. Anti-conservative deviations will occur when a method
does not properly take into account the fact that the association
statistics are formed between the variables and PCs (which have
been built from the variables themselves), leading to over-fitting
and anti-conservative P values. Evaluation of the joint null cri-
terion works by simulating many datasets (corresponding to in-
dependently repeated studies) from a given data generating
process (Supplementary Fig. S3). The joint behavior of the null
P values is then evaluated among these.

We considered 16 simulation scenarios, described below. For a
given scenario, we simulated 500 independent studies and calcu-
lated 500 KS test P values, each of which is based on the set of
null P values from its respective study. In other words, for 500
simulation datasets per scenario, 500 KS test P values are calcu-
lated to measure deviations from the Uniform(0,1); a second
application of the KS test is then performed on these 500 KS
P values to assess whether any anti-conservative deviation from
the Uniform(0,1) among these studies has occurred

Fig. 4. Sixteen simulation scenarios generated by combining four design
factors. To assess the statistical accuracy of the conventional F-test and
the proposed method, we simulated 500 independent studies for each
scenario, and assessed statistical accuracy according to the “joint null
criterion” (Leek and Storey, 2011). For the b,- e {—1, 1} scenarios, non-
null coefﬁcients were set to either -1 or 1 with a probability of 0.5. For a
given simulation study, a valid statistical testing procedure must yield a
set of null P values that are jointly distributed Uniform(0,1). We use a KS
test to identify deviations from the Uniform(0,1) distribution.
Supplementary Material, Figure SS provides a detailed overview of the
evaluation pipeline

(Supplementary Fig. S3). If the statistical method being evalu-
ated provides accurate measures of statistical signiﬁcance, the
collection of double KS test P values must be distributed
Uniform(0,1). This guards against any single simulated dataset
leading one to an incorrect conclusion by chance. This technique
is the ‘double KS test’ introduced by Leek and Storey (2011).

Overall, we demonstrate that our proposed method provides
accurate measures of statistical signiﬁcance of the associations
between variables and the latent variables, when the latent vari-
ables themselves are directly estimated from the data Via PCA.
At the same time, we show that the conventional method does
not provide accurate statistical signiﬁcance measures.

4.1.2 Simulation scenarios and results We constructed 16 simu-
lation scenarios representing a wide range of conﬁgurations of
signal and noise (Fig. 4), with 500 independent studies simulated
from each. Let us first consider one of the simpler scenarios in
detail. Model (1) is used to generate the data. In this particular
scenario, we have m = 1000, n = 20, r = 1 and

L:4/$(I,I,I,I,I,1,1,1,1,I,*I,*I,*I,’I,’I,’Iailaila’Lil),

a dichotomous mean shift resembling differential expression be-

tween the first 10 observations and the second 10 observations.

(The factor ,/”n;1 is to give L unit variance.) For 95% of the

variables, we set b,- = 0, implying they are null variables; we par-

ameterize this proportion by no =0.95. The other 50 non-null
i.i.d

variables were simulated such that b,~ Uniform(0,1).

The noise terms are simulated as eijLLd Normal(0,1). The data
for variable i are thus simulated according to y,- =b,-L+e,-.

between the observed variables and the latent variables by

The proposed method produces null P values distributed Uniform(0,1).
The dashed line shows the Uniform(0,1) density function

forming association statistics between the observed yl, yz, . . .,
ym and their collective PC, V,.T (r = 1). We calculated P values
using both the conventional F test and the proposed method with
s = 50 synthetic null variables (Fig. 5). Over 500 simulated
datasets, the conventional F test resulted in 500 one-sided KS
P values that exhibit a strong anti-conservative bias with a
double KS P value of =9.71 x 10’196 (Supplementary Fig. S4,
black points). Conversely, the proposed method correctly calcu-
lates null P values, by accounting for the over-ﬁtted measure-
ment error in PCA, with a double KS P value of 0.502
(Supplementary Fig. S4, orange points). Alternatively, a com-
parison of estimated versus true FDR demonstrates an appro-
priate adjustment for over-ﬁtting in the jackstraw method
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Note that the classiﬁcation of null P
values is based on the true association status from the popula-
tion-level data generating distribution from model (1), not based
on model (2) or on the observed loadings from the PCA.

We carried out analogous analyses on 15 more simulation
scenarios, detailed in Fig. 4. We used all possible combinations
of the following: (1) either dichotomous or sinusoidal functions
for L; (2) the parameters B were simulated from either a
Bernoulli or Uniform distribution; (3) m = 1000 or m = 5000
variables; and (4) the proportion of true null variables set to
either 710 = 0.75 or 710 = 0.95. The proposed method was applied
with s=0.05m, 0.10m, and 0.25m to study the impact of the
choice of the number of synthetic null variables. For each scen-
ario, we applied the joint null criterion double KS evaluation
(Supplementary Fig. S3), using 500 simulated data sets. The con-
ventional F test method consistently produced anti-conservative
null P values, while the proposed method yielded accurately dis-
tributed null P values (Fig. 6).

In these simulations, we found that the proposed method
tended to produce more conservative null P values as s increased
(Fig. 6). The explanation for this is that inclusion of a larger
number of synthetic null variables leads to a greater over-ﬁtting
of PCA to the noise, which in turn yields a conservative empirical
null distribution formed by the synthetic null statistics. We,
therefore, identiﬁed a trade-off between computational speed
and how conservative the calculated P values are in the choice
of s. We note, however, that the null P values were never
observed to be prohibitively conservative in that the power
became unreasonably diminished. In practice, the user has the

Fig. 6. QQ-plots of double KS test P values from 16 simulation scenarios
versus the Uniform(0,1) distribution. For each of 500 independent studies
per scenario, we tested for deviation of null P values from Uniform(0,1),
resulting in 500 KS test P values for each scenario. An individual point in
the QQ-plot represents a double KS test P value for one scenario, com-
paring its 500 KS test P values to Uniform(0,1). On the left panel, the
systematic downward displacement of 16 black points indicates an anti-
conservative bias of the conventional F-test. In contrast, the proposed
method produces null P values that are not anti-conservative. On the
right panel, a set of 16 points are below the diagonal red line if the
joint null distribution deviates from the Uniform(0,1) distribution. The
proposed method adjusts for over-fitting of PCA and produces accurate
estimates of association signiﬁcance

option to lower the value of s to minimize this, at the cost of
greater computation.

We note that we also investigated a delete-s version of the
jackstraw, which draws on ideas from our proposed method,
which one could call the permute-s jackstraw. However, this im-
plementation did not produce valid null P values (Supplementary
Material).

4.1.3 Testing for associations on subsets of PCs We have gen-
eralized the proposed method to be able to test for associations
on any subset of the top r PCs, while adjusting for the remaining
PCs among the top r. Here, we demonstrate that the proposed
method can identify variables driving a chosen subset of PCs of
interest, VrT1 , while adjusting for the remaining of the top r PCs
which are not of interest, VrTo, where r0 -l- r1 = r. Based on model
(1), we simulated data with m = 1000, n = 20, r = 2 and

L1=4/$(I,I,1,1,I,I,I,I,I,I,*I,*I,*I,’I,’I,’I,’I,’I,’Ia’1)a

L2=4/$(l,l,1,1,Lilrlrlrlrl,1,1,1.1,lrlrlrlrlrl)‘

L1 and L2 are truly associated with 100 variables and 60 vari-
ables, respectively. Among these, 40 variables that are truly asso-

ciated with both L1 and L2. We generated the noise term as eijlid
Normal(0,1). We set r = 2 and tested for associations with the
ﬁrst PC while adjusting for the second PC. Note that the first PC
effectively captured the signal from the ﬁrst latent variable. In
this case, the null variables were deﬁned to be 900 variables
associated with either only the second latent variable or no
latent variable. The conventional F test resulted in an anti-
conservative bias among the null P values, with a double KS

test P value of 8.73x10’20, while the proposed method

produced a correct joint null P value distribution with a
double KS test P value of 0.352 (Supplementary Fig. S6).

We performed a similar simulation with r = 5 true underlying
latent variables and also studied the result of setting r to be too
small or too large in model (2). For m = 1000 variables and
n = 20 observations (no =0.75), we simulated r = 5 latent vari-
ables simulated from one of each of the following distributions: a
randomized dichotomous variable, Normal(0,1), Uniform(0,1),
Bin(2, 0.5), and Normal(0,0.25). We applied the jackstraw algo-
rithm with s = 0.1m and the conventional F test to the simulated
data with 17 = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 used in model (2). To detect an anti-con-
servative bias, we applied a one-sided KS-test on P values corres-
ponding to the true null variables as done above. Since there exist
in truth r = 5 latent variables, the results with f = 1, 3 and f = 7, 9
demonstrate the operating characteristics when the number of
PCs is under- or over-speciﬁed, respectively. We found that the
jackstraw method resulted in valid null P values while the conven-
tional test did not (Supplementary Fig. S7).

4.2 Application to gene expression studies

Typically, genomic variables are tested for the associations with
external variables, which are measured independently of genomic
proﬁling technology, such as disease status, treatment labels, or
time points. However, external variables may be imprecise or
inaccurate due to poor understanding of the biology or techno-
logical limitations; sometimes the external variables of interest
may not be capable of being measured at all. For example, in a
cancer gene expression study, the cancer types may be based on
histological classiﬁcation of the tumor cells. Then, association
tests, such as F tests, are conducted between the histological
classiﬁcation and transcriptional levels to discover genes of inter-
est. However, the histological classiﬁcation of cancer tumors may
not distinguish important cancer subtypes (Alizadeh et al., 2000;
DeRisi et al., 1996). This lack of information may lead to a
spurious signal or reduced power in statistical inference.

When the external variables are unmeasured or imprecise, we
are interested in using the latent variable basis, L, to discover
genes of interest (Fig. 1). Because L is never directly measured,
we must estimate it from the genomic data, using PCA and
related methods. We apply our proposed method to two genomic
datasets to demonstrate its utility in practice.

4.2.1 Cell-cycle regulated gene expression in S. cerevisiae It is
known that in S. cerevisiae there is an abundance of genes whose
transcription is regulated with respect to the cell cycle (Cho et al.,
1998; Spellman et al., 1998). Nonetheless, comprehensive identi-
fication of the yeast genes whose expression is regulated by the
cell cycle is still an active area of research, since it is unclear how
the yeast cell-cycle regulation should be quantiﬁed and modeled
(Pramila et al., 2006; Rowicka et al., 2007; Tu et al., 2005; Wu
and Li, 2008). The experimental time points after cell population
synchronization are readily measured, but this external variable
does not directly represent periodic transcriptional regulation
with respect to the cell cycle.

Suppose that we want to carry out a hypothesis test on each
gene of whether it shows regulation associated with a periodic
pattern over the cell cycle. The null hypothesis is then that popu-
lation mean is not periodic over the cell cycle. This null

Significance of variables driving systematic variation

 

hypothesis contains an inﬁnite number of mean time-course tra-
jectories that are non-periodic, making the null hypothesis com-
posite. A composite null hypothesis such as this one is largely
intractable because it contains an unwieldy class of potential
probability distributions describing gene expression. Indeed, a
survey of the literature reveals that this composite null hypoth-
esis is the major challenge when a traditional hypothesis testing
approach is taken. However, using our approach, we can reduce
the complexity of this problem by directly estimating the mani-
fested systematic periodic expression variation and applying the
proposed method to identify genes associated with this system-
atic variation due to the latent variables, L.

Spellman et al. (1998) measured transcriptional levels of
m = 5981 yeast genes, every 30 min for 390 min after synchro-
nizing the cell cycle among a population of cells by elutriation.
The top two PCs capture the manifestation of cell-cycle regula-
tion on gene expression (Alter et al., 2000), explaining 48% of
total variance (Fig. 2a, b). By testing for associations between
time-course gene expression and the top two PCs, we avoid this
challenging problem and consider instead the tractable associ-
ation signiﬁcance testing problem with a simple null hypothesis
H0 : 7, =0 versus H1 : 71 75 0 (as opposed to a composite null).
The hypothesis test is now simply whether gene i is associated
with 17 =2 latent variables estimated by the top two PCs.

We applied the proposed method (with s = 100 and
B= 2 x m) to test this hypothesis and identified a large number
of genes associated with yeast cell-cycle regulation. (We did not
use functional PCA (Ramsay and Silverman, 2005; Yao et al.,
2005) to smooth the PCs with respect to time, although the jack-
straw method is amendable to do so.) We discovered that ap-
proximately 84% of the 5981 measured genes are associated with
the top two PCs (fro =0.16). At FDR 5 1%, 2998 genes were
found to be statistically signiﬁcant. Hierarchical clustering
applied to these 2998 genes reveals the cell-cycle patterns cap-
tured by the top two PCs (Fig. 2c). The generalized proposed
method allows us to compute statistical significance measures of
associations with a subset of PCs. When testing for associations
with the first PC while adjusting for the second PC, 1666 genes
were called statistically signiﬁcant at FDR 5 1%, with the esti-
mated proportion of null variables fro=34.4%. On the other
hand, at the same FDR threshold, we found 984 genes were
significantly associated with the second PC with fro = 39.6%.

We applied the conventional test to the top two PCs in this
data set and investigated its degree of over-ﬁtting (yielding arti-
ﬁcially small P values) as a function of the number of variables.
This was accomplished by randomly sampling a subset of vari-
ables, applying each method to this subset of data, and then
comparing the P value distributions of the jackstraw and con-
ventional tests. It can be observed that smaller numbers of vari-
ables yield larger differences in the P value distributions, where
the conventional test P values tend to be artiﬁcially small
(Supplementary Fig. S8).

To explore the impact of the choice of r on the proposed
method, we conducted the jackstraw analysis setting 17 = 1 and 17
= 3 in model (2) (Supplementary Fig. S10). Notably, we found
that setting 17 = 3 yielded similar results to setting 17 = 2, similarly
to what we observed in the simulation study (Supplementary Fig.
S7). Setting f = 1 resulted in lower levels of statistical signiﬁcance,
and there was no obvious evidence of adverse effects from the

fact that ignoring the 2nd PC induces dependence in the residuals
of the model used with 17 = 1 (Leek and Storey, 2007, 2008).

It was demonstrated in the simulation studies that the pro-
posed method produces valid null P values that satisfy the
joint null criterion. To complement this analysis, we sought to
verify on the real data set that applying the proposed algorithm
with s = 100 and B = 10 produces P values that are similar to
the most exhaustive method that makes the fewest assumptions.
Speciﬁcally, we applied the proposed algorithm with s = 1 and
B = 1000 where in calculating the P value for variable i, synthetic
null statistics were constructed only on variable i. [The exhaustive
method calculates within-gene P values, whereas the proposed
method calculates P values from null statistics pooled across
genes; see Leek and Storey (2011) for more on this distinction.]
This required B = 1000 iterations of the algorithm for each of
the m = 5981 genes, for a total of 5 981 000 SVD calculations
and synthetic null statistics. Then, we calculated p,- =#{
17?” 2 F,-; b= 1, ...,1000}/1000 for each gene i=1, ... ,5981.
This set-up gives an equivalent resolution to our proposed
method with s = 100 and B = 10 because each P value is also
based on 1000 synthetic null statistics. However, for the exhaust-
ive method, the number of null statistic calculations is 5981-fold
higher and the number of SVD calculations is 598 100-fold
higher. We plotted the P values for each set-up against one an-
other, where it can be seen in Supplementary Fig. S9 that the set
of 5981 P values is very similar between the proposed method
and the exhaustive method.

4.2.2 Inﬂammation associated gene expression in post-trauma
patients Large-scale clinical genomic studies often lead to
unique analytical challenges, including dealing with a large
number of clinical variables, unclear clinical endpoints or disease
labels, and expression heterogeneity (Leek and Storey, 2007).
The ‘Inﬂammation and the Host Response to Injury’ (IHRI)
consortium carried out a longitudinal clinical genomics study
on blunt force trauma patients. They collected 393 clinical vari-
ables (some longitudinal) and time-course gene expression (total
of 797 microarrays) on 168 post-trauma patients (Desai et al.,
2011). One of the main goals in this study was to elucidate how
inﬂammatory responses after blunt force trauma are manifested
on gene expression. To aggregate relevant clinical variables into a
manageable daily score, the IHRI consortium used a modiﬁed
version of the Marshall score to rate the severity of multiple
organ dysfunction syndrome (Marshall et al., 1995).

Based on the modiﬁed Marshall score trajectories, Desai et al.
(2011) clustered post-trauma patients into five groups, called
‘ordered categorical Multiple Organ Failure’ (ocMOF) labels.
The time-course gene expression proﬁles of each patient were
summarized by ‘within patient expression changes’ (WPEC;
Desai et al., 2011). Then, they tested for correlations between
the WPEC genomic variables and the ocMOF score to discover
genes associated with inﬂammatory responses of post-trauma
patients. However, the use of the potentially noisy ocMOF clin-
ical variable may impose limitations, as patients with similar
Marshall scores may exhibit a wide range of clinical outcomes
(Cobb et al., 2005). Furthermore, ﬁve discrete values for the
ocMOF scores potentially limits the resolution of the clinical
variable.

To investigate this further, we used our proposed approach
where the gene expression itself was used to construct clinical
phenotypes on the patients. We directly used the WPEC data
to characterize the molecular signature of inﬂammatory re-
sponses to blunt force trauma. We estimated the manifestation
of post-trauma inﬂammatory responses on gene expression, L,
with the top nine PCs (Supplementary Fig. S11). Then, we
applied the proposed method to identify the genomic variables
in WPEC associated with the top nine PCs. The original analysis
in Desai et al. (2011) estimated 24% of the 54 675 genomic vari-
ables (probe sets) to be associated with the ocMOF score. In
contrast, our analysis revealed a much larger proportions of
the genomic variables to be signiﬁcantly associated with the
major sources of variation, ranging from 62% for first PC to
39% for ninth PC.

The genes identiﬁed in the original analysis (Desai et al., 2011)
were largely identified in our analysis, although our analysis
provided many more signiﬁcant genes. To compare the biolo-
gical relevance of our re-analysis versus the original analysis, we
tested for enrichment of 17 inﬂammation-related gene sets (Loza
et al., 2007), using one-sided Mann=Whitney=Wilcoxon tests
with permutation-based signiﬁcance. At the FDR 5 1%, none
of the inﬂammatory-related gene sets is enriched for the original
analysis using the ocMOF scores (Desai et al., 2011). In contrast,
a large number of inﬂammation-related gene sets are signiﬁcantly
enriched when the genomic variables are tested for the associ-
ations with the top nine PCs individually (Table 1). MAPK sig-
naling is enriched for every PC, except ﬁfth PC, whereas Innate
Pathogen Detection is enriched for ﬁrst, fourth, sixth, and ninth
PCs, at the FDR 5 1%. Those two biological pathways were
emphasized in the original analysis (Desai et al., 2011) as indicat-
ing down-regulation of innate pathogen detection and up-regu-
lation of MAPK signaling pathway, and they were seen as strong
predictors of long-term complications from brute force trauma.
Based on enrichment tests, the proposed method appears to

provide a biologically richer source of information than the ana-
lysis based on the ocMOF scores.

As with the previous study, we applied the conventional test in
comparison to the jackstraw method as a function of number of
variables, and we observed the same phenomenon where the
conventional method clearly overﬁts as a function of the
number of variables (Supplementary Fig. S8).

5 DISCUSSION

We have developed a method to accurately carry out statistical
significance tests of associations between high-dimensional vari-
ables and latent variables, which have been estimated through
systematic variation present in the observed high-dimensional
variables themselves. Our approach is to maintain the overall
systematic variation in the high-dimensional dataset, while repla-
cing a small number of observed variables with independently
permuted synthetic null variables. These synthetic null variables
allow us to estimate the null distribution of the association stat-
istics calculated on the original data that takes into account the
inherent over-ﬁtting that occurs when estimating latent variables
through methods such as PCA. We call this approach the jack-
straw because it draws on the idea of the game of jackstraws,
where a player must remove a stick (i.e. a variable) from a pile of
tangled sticks without disturbing the overall structure. Through
extensive simulations, we demonstrated that the proposed
method is capable of accounting for over-fitting and producing
accurate statistical signiﬁcance measures. We also demonstrated
that applying conventional association testing methods to this
problem artiﬁcially inﬂates the statistical signiﬁcance of
associations.

An input required for the proposed method is the number of
PCs, r, that capture systematic variation from latent variables.
Determining the number of ‘statistically signiﬁcant’ PCs is an
active area of research, and deﬁning a number of significant

Significance of variables driving systematic variation

 

PCs depends on the data structure and the context (Anderson,
1963; Buja and Eyuboglu, 1992; Johnstone, 2001; Leek, 2010;
Tracy and Widom, 1996). Note that setting r to be too small
leads to dependence in the residuals of model (2). This leads to
the problems of dependence discussed in Leek and Storey (2007,
2008). Subsets of PCs can be considered while conditioning on
other PCs in the jackstraw framework (Supplementary Material),
so it is possible to avoid setting r to be too small. For example, if
one would like to identify variables associated with the top three
PCs, but is unsure whether the given data has three or four sig-
niﬁcant PCs, we have found it more robust to input 17 = 4, which
will adjust for potential systematic residual variation captured by
the fourth PC.

We demonstrated our approach using PCA. It is well known
that individual PCs may not be directly interpretable or may
contain multiple signals of interest that the user wishes to distin-
guish. The jackstraw method allows one to pinpoint a set of
genomic variables associated with any given PC, a subset of
PCs, a linear combination of two or more PCs, the projection
of a subset of PCs onto an external variable, rotations of subsets
of PCs, and low-dimensional latent variable estimates from other
methods (see Supplementary Material). Therefore, this approach
can be used to investigate and identify biological signals that may
manifest in a particular subspace spanned by the estimated latent
variables. We do not advocate blindly applying our method to
the top r PCs without considering these issues.

Since the proposed method allows one to rigorously identify
subsets of genomic variables associated with PCs, it allows one to
also investigate whether these subsets have any biological coher-
ence. This may be useful in investigating whether a space spanned
by a subset of PCs captures relevant biological signal or is merely
reﬂecting technical artifacts (e. g. batch effects in gene expression
data). The method also improves the surrogate variable analysis
algorithm of Leek and Storey (2007, 2008) in that it allows a more
precise determination of the control variables that are used to
estimate the surrogate variables. Thus, we have found the jack-
straw to also be useful in the context of dealing with latent vari-
ables that reﬂect technical effects of no biological relevance.

The proposed method represents a novel resampling approach
operating on variables, whereas established resampling
approaches, such as the jackknife and the bootstrap, tend to
operate on observations (Efron, 1979; Quenouille, 1949; Tukey,
1958). When applying these methods, systematic variation due to
latent variables is intentionally perturbed, since their purpose is
typically to assess the sampling variation of a single variable. In
high-dimensional data, we may need to preserve systematic vari-
ation due to latent variables, which is the problem that the jack-
straw addresses.

By accurately testing for associations between observed high-
dimensional variables and the systematic manifestation of latent
variables in the observed variables, our proposed method allows
for the automatic discovery of complex sources of variation and
the genomic variables that drive them. The proposed method
extends PCA and related methods beyond their popular applica-
tions in exploring, Visualizing and characterizing the systematic
variation to genomic variable level (e.g. gene-level) signiﬁcance
analyses. Given the increasingly important role that non-
parametric estimation of systematic variation plays in the ana-
lysis of genomic data (Alter et al., 2000; Leek and Storey, 2007;

Price et al., 2006), the proposed method may be useful in many
areas of quantitative biology using high-throughput technologies
as well as other areas of high-dimensional data analysis.

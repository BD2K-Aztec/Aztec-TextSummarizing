ABSTRACT

Summary: We introduce NOVA, a software for the analysis of
complexome profiling data. NOVA supports the investigation of the
composition of complexes, cluster analysis of the experimental data,
visual inspection and comparison of experiments and many other
features.

Availability and implementation: NOVA is licensed under the Artistic
License 2.0. It is freely available at http://www.bioinformatik.uni-
frankfurt.de. NOVA requires at least Java 7 and runs under Linux,
Microsoft Windows and Mac OS.

1 INTRODUCTION

To facilitate diverse cellular functions, proteins can associate to
form complex molecular machineries. Complexome profiling
(CP, Heide et a]. 2012) uses blue-native gel electrophoresis to
separate intact proteins and protein complexes up to a molecular
weight of 10 MDa (Schagger and Jagow, 1991; Wittig et al.,
2006) or even 60 MDa (Strecker et al., 2010) using special
large pore gels (LP-BNE). After the separation, the gel strip is
cut into 60 equally sized slices. Migration proﬁles are recon-
structed by applying mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify
the proteins contained in each slice. The relative abundance of
each protein is calculated by label-free LC/MS-based quantiﬁca-
tion (Heide et al., 2012). Through comparison of these proﬁles
by hierarchical clustering, groups of co-migrating proteins are
recognized, indicating the composition of quaternary structures
and functional complexes (Andersen et al., 2003; Foster et al.,
2006; Wessels et al., 2009). The method has been successfully
applied to analyze mitochondrial complexes in rats (Heide
et al., 2012) and humans (Wessels et al., 2013) as well as
to explore complex formation in plants and bacteria
(Takabayashi et al., 2013). Typically, experimental datasets con-
tain up to thousands of migration proﬁles, which cannot be
manually processed. Bioinformatic tools are needed to efﬁciently
handle and Visualize these data. Though several programs like

Cluster 3.0 (de Hoon et al., 2004), Java TreeView (Saldanha,
2004) or the MultiExperiment Viewer (Saeed et al., 2003) have
been applied, there is to the best of our knowledge no tool avail-
able that supplies all functionalities required for the Visualization
and evaluation of CP data.

2 FEATURES

We developed NOVAia ﬂexible interactive tool for the analysis
and Visual inspection of CP data. Protein abundance proﬁles
obtained by other protein separation techniques, such as density
gradient centrifugation or size exclusion chromatography, may
also be analyzed with NOVA. Datasets can be imported as XLS,
XLSX, CSV or TXT ﬁles. NOVA displays the migration proﬁles as
a heat map, see Figure 1A, providing mouse functionality for
Visual inspection and data management. Links to databases like
UniProt (Magrane and UniProt Consortium, 2011) enable the
fast access to additional information about the proteins. For the
identiﬁcation of complex formation changes, for example, caused
by a knockdown of a speciﬁc assembly factor, heat maps of
multiple CP data can be compared. NOVA supports the normal-
ization of data by range, maximum values, proﬁle area and unit
vector. Migration proﬁles of selected proteins can be compared,
applying the module proﬁle viewer, see Figure 1B.

The clustering of migration proﬁles is the basic step for the
prediction of the composition of protein complexes. For this
purpose, NOVA implements the distance measures of Euclid,
Pearson, Manhattan and hierarchical clustering covering single,
complete, average and Wards linkage. A tree viewer displays the
cluster hierarchy, see Figure 1C. Proteins and/or entire mass
ranges can be excluded from the clustering process allowing
the investigation of speciﬁc data subsets. Clustered data can be
exported as XLS, XLSX, CSV or TXT files, figures as JPEG,
PNG, TIFF or BMP files.

3 SUMMARY

NOVA is a freely available software tool for the evaluation and
Visualization of CP datasets. It supports highly ﬂexible and inter-
active inspection, exploration and analysis of complexome data.
The implemented analysis techniques focus on hierarchical
clustering methods that are the current standard approach to

from rat hearth mitochondria (Heide et al., 2012): (A) The heat map represents

gel migration proﬁles. Each row displays the proﬁle of an individual protein. A label at the end of each row identiﬁes the protein. The background color

of the label indicates a known membership of the protein to a complex (h
of the heat map, a mass scale shows the expected mass of proteins as

ere 10 subunits of respiratory complex C 111 and 3 subunits of C 1). On the top
sembled in the gel slices. The migration proﬁles are clustered (here Pearson

correlation, average linkage). Left, the corresponding cluster subtree is aligned to the heat map. A cluster of proteins in the cluster tree is highlighted,
corresponding to the selected rows of the heat map. (B) A diagram displays the migration proﬁles of the selected proteins. Each peak of the consensus
proﬁle corresponds to a protein assembly, functional complex or supercomplex. These assemblies can be identiﬁed by their distinct mass. For example,
the selected proteins are members of the respiratory homodimeric complex 1112, the complex assembly 11121V and the series of supercomplexes STS3.

provides functionalities to assist the study of different experimen-
tal conditions, knockout experiments and disease-related
changes. It is already applied by various research groups working
with CP data.

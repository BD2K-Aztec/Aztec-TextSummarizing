ABSTRACT

Summary: Biochemical reactions play a key role to help sustain
life and allow cells to grow. Raninder was developed to search
biochemical reactions from KEGG reaction database using three
search criteria: molecular structures, molecular fragments and
reaction similarity. Raninder is helpful to get reference reactions for
biosynthesis and xenobiotics metabolism.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diverse biochemical reactions participate in various important
biosynthesis and metabolic pathways. Those reactions are manually
curated and stored in several widely used databases (Croft et (11.,
2011; Jennen et (11., 2010; Kanehisa et (11., 2008; Reitz et (11.,
2004). The KEGG reaction database (Kanehisa et (11 ., 2008) contains
>8000 reactions. The KEGG reaction database search tools include
SIMCOMP and SUBCOMP (Hattori et (11., 2003, 2010), reaction
ID, name, reactant entry, pathway and enzyme. In the present work
(Raninder), three additional search engines are developed to help
researchers retrieve KEGG reactions.

2 DESCRIPTION

In Raninder, users can search KEGG reactions using molecular
structures, molecular fragments and reaction similarity for different
purposes.

2.1 Search reactions with a molecular structure

A molecule matching tool was developed to ﬁnd reactions with
a speciﬁc molecule. When a query molecule is input using
molecule SMILES string (Weininger, 1988; Weininger et (11.,
1989), KEGG reactions with the molecule will be listed one by
one. The algorithm used in Raninder is a string comparison
based on canonical SMILES string (Weininger et (11., 1989).
First, the canonical SMILES strings are calculated and stored

in a database for all molecules in KEGG reactions. Secondly,
the canonical SMILES string is computed for a query molecule.
Thirdly, if the SMILES string of query molecule is matched
with a SMILES string in the database, they are regarded as
the same molecule. Then, reactions with the molecule will be
retrieved. An example on searching biosynthesis reaction with
l, 3-dihydroxy-N-methylacridone is shown in Figure 1. In this
search engine example, molecular canonical SMILES strings [for
example, Oclcc(O)c2c(cl)n(C)clccccclc2=O for l, 3-dihydroxy-
N-methylacridone, a metabolite in alkaloids biosynthesis] are
applied to both KEGG reaction molecules and the input molecule.
In this case, there are four reactions (R07250, R08470, R08471
and R08472) obtained. One (R07250) of the reactions is listed in
Figure l, in which 1, 3-dihydroxy-N-methylacridone is located on
the product side.

2.2 Search reactions containing a speciﬁc molecular
fragment

Users can search reactions with a speciﬁc molecular fragment. The
key of this engine is substructure search (Xu, 1996). Substructure

search is in essence a graph comparison algorithm (Hattori et (11.,
2003, 2010). Figure 2 exempliﬁes searching reactions with 7-
amino-3-cephem-4-carboxy1ic acid, an important structure core of
antibiotics. After the SMILES string of the molecular fragment [for
instance, NC1C(=O)N2C1SCC=C2C(=O)O of 7-Amino-3-cephem-
4-carboxylic acid] is input, reaction molecules will be scanned to
identify if any molecule contains the speciﬁc fragment. Eventually,
there are 13 reactions retrieved. One (R03062) of the reactions is
listed in Figure 2, in which 7-amino-3-cephem-4-carboxy1ic acid
can be found on both reactant and product sides.

2.3 Search similar reactions

We propose to search reactions using reactions similarity to ﬁnd
reactions with the same kind of chemical transformation. In this
engine, reaction similarity is calculated using reaction difference
ﬁngerprints (RDF). RDF is computed using molecular ﬁngerprints.
The molecular ﬁngerprint (Swarnidass and Baldi, 2007) of a
molecule is deﬁned as M Fp = (F i), in which Fl- refers to a molecular
fragment with real occurrences in a molecule. The ﬁngerprints of
reactant molecules minus the ﬁngerprints of product molecules
will generate RDF as RFP = (RF,), in which RFl- represents the
difference of a fragment occurring on reactants and products. After
calculating RDF of two reactions, the similarity of two reactions can
be computed using a Euclidean distance measurement as deﬁned
as Disj = ED(RFp1,-, RFP’J‘). The smaller the distance between two
reactions, the more similar they are.

Using the reaction similarity measurement, reactions similar to
an input reaction can be retrieved from KEGG reaction database.
An example is show in Figure 3. In this example, researchers
are seeking for reactions similar to a metabolic reaction making
Toluene to be a more soluble compound. After the SMIRKS string
(Leach et (11., 1999) of a reaction is input, 148 reactions with
distance 0 to the input reaction can be retrieved from KEGG reaction
database. The distance 0 means the retrieved reaction holds the
same chemical transformation to the input reaction. For example,
phenol oxidoreductase (KEGG R00815) is retrieved. From the
comparison of the two reactions, they hold the same kind of chemical

3 DISCUSSION

KEGG provides two ways to search reactions with a
molecule structure: KEGG_Mol_A using compound ID
(http://www.genome.jp/kegg/compound/); and KEGG_Mol_B
using SUBCOMP (http://www.genome.jp/tools/subcomp/) or
SIMCOMP (http://www.genome.jp/tools/simcomp/) (Hattori et (11.,
2003, 2010). The results obtained by Raninder are the same
as KEGG_Mol_A. The difference is that the input in Raninder
is molecular structure; however, the input in KEGG_Mol_A is
compound ID. When molecular structure (such as clccccclBr) is
input, Raninder retrieves two reactions (R07066 and R07068)
with clccccclBr. KEGG_Mol_A gets the same two reactions
if the compound ID (C11036) is input. However, users usually
do not know the KEGG ID of a speciﬁc molecule, for instance
C11036 for Bromobenzene. Then, if the molecule structure of
Bromobenzene is input to KEGG search engines. KEGG_Mol_B
using SUBCOMP will retrieve 30 reactions. KEGG_Mol_B using
SIMCOMP will retrieve 571 reactions, in which most of them are
similar to clccccclBr, but not identical clccccclBr. The reason
might be that SIMCOMP and SUBCOMP are developed to search

Euclidean distance

signiﬁcance analysis. True or false positives mean that the retrieved reactions
have or have not the same chemical transformations with the query reaction,
respectively. We divided the scale of the X -axis into 11 parts: (L10, 11720

similar molecules. In KEGG database, there are two reactions
(R07066 and R07068) containing Bromobenzene (clccccclBr).

For reaction search for a given molecular fragment, the algorithm
used is a substructure match method (Xu, 1996). Our method
can support SMART (http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory
/theory.smarts.html) SMILES string search. The implementations in
KEGG are based on SUBCOMP algorithms (Hattori et (11., 2010).
Raninder will retrieve 1855 reactions with Enamine fragment
([NX3][CX3]=[CX3], a SMART SMILES string for Enamine).
KEGG SUBCOMP (http://www.genome.jp/tools/subcomp/) does
not support SMART SMILES string search.

The novelty of this proposed reaction similarity is, at least to
our knowledge, the ﬁrst tool of its kind for retrieving biochemical
reactions. The reaction similarity search is based on the Euclidean
distance measurement of two reactions. After calculating reaction
similarity between KEGG reactions and an input reaction, the
KEGG reactions are retrieved based on the similarity rank.
The distance values can range from 0 to inﬁnity (theoretically).
The distance 0 means the retrieved reaction holds the same
chemical transformation to the input reaction. The direct prediction
performance measurement of reaction similarity search is to check
if the retrieved reactions are with the same chemical transformation
pattern of the input reaction. Regarding to the statistical rigorousness
of reaction similarity, we applied an indirect way to get raw
similarity scores, and found distance <10 is a good threshold. The
methodology is as follows: (i) the reactions with the same chemical
transformation have the same EC numbers. (ii) Take one reaction

out as query reaction, and use the most similar reaction to predict
the EC number of the query reaction. (iii) By leave-one-out cross
validation, we found that similarity scores (in this case, reaction
Euclidean distance) within 10 will get satisfactory accuracy (> 85%).
(iv) The analysis is shown in Figure 4. In Raninder, distance 10
is now used as a statistics threshold to select reactions similar to an
input reaction.

4 CONCLUSION

Raninder presents a collection of searching engines to search
biochemical reactions from KEGG reaction database. With the
engines at hand, researchers can get reference reactions for further
analysis. Raninder also includes online tools to input molecules
and reactions, calculate molecular fragments, compute reaction
difference ﬁngerprints and measure reaction distance.

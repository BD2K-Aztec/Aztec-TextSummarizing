Abstract

Motivation: TCS is a widely used haplotype network reconstruction software, but lacks the capabil—
ity of overlapping genetic with geographic structure, which is often a first step in phylogeographic

analysis.

Results: tcsBU is a web—based program that extends the capabilities of TCS, by implementing
haplotype classification into an arbitrary user—defined scheme, which is displayed as pie—chart
like graphs embedded into the network. Taking advantage of modern graphic libraries, tcsBU also
improves the speed at which the final network layout is reached. Networks can be saved as a

Scalable Vector Graphics format.

Availability and implementation: tcsBU is available on—line at http://cibio.up.pt/software/tcsBU/. The
source code is freely available from https://github.com/sairum/tcsbu/ under a standard MIT license.

1 Introduction

Construction of haplotype networks that represent genealogical re-
lationships among genes at the population level is often a first step
of any phylogeographic analysis. Because gene-genealogies are usu-
ally polytomous and network-like, traditional tree-building meth-
ods, which force dichotomous branching patterns, are seldom
applicable (Bandelt et (11., 1995). Different methods were developed
to overcome such problems (e.g. Bandelt et (11., 1999; Excoffier and
Lischer, 2010). Among these, TCS (Clement et (11., 2000) is unique,
in that it implements the probabilistic method of Statistical
Parsimony (Templeton et (11., 1992). This allows users to arbitrarily
define the probability at which haplotypes connect with each other,
which may yield multiple networks per analysis. This feature has
been suggested as a species delimitation tool in barcoding analysis
(Hart and Sunday, 2007).

Although the core TCS algorithm (network computation) is fast,
there are some major limitations related with its graphical output. In
most phylogeographic analyses, it is often useful to combine genetic

structure (network topology) with geographic structure (haplotype
occurrence), but TCS has no built-in way of classifying haplotypes
and displaying that information in the final network. TCS cannot
use its ‘spring’ method to layout multiple networks, meaning
that the resulting overlapped networks should to be disentangled
manually using an external vector manipulation software.
Moreover, the ‘spring’ method is extremely slow to layout large or
complex networks. As a consequence, it takes a significant effort to
edit the resulting TCS vector file to produce publication-ready
networks.

2 Overview

tcsBU was developed to extend TCS capabilities, namely by providing
a way to arbitrarily classify haplotypes and to display that information
on the final network. Its force-directed layout algorithm is much faster
than TCS’s own ‘spring’ method, and can handle multiple network re-
sults easily (Fig. 1). Using any modern browser, users are exposed to an

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identifying protein cavities, channels and pockets access-
ible to ligands is a major step to predict potential protein—ligands
complexes. It is also essential for preparation of protein—ligand dock-
ing experiments in the context of enzymatic activity mechanism and
structure-based drug design.

Results: We introduce a new method, implemented in a program
named CCCPP, which computes the void parts of the proteins, i.e.
cavities, channels and pockets. The present approach is a variant of
the alpha shapes method, with the advantage of taking into account
the size and the shape of the ligand. We show that the widely used
spherical model of ligands is most of the time inadequate and that
cylindrical shapes are more realistic. The analysis of the void parts of
the protein is done via a network of channels depending on the ligand.
The performance of CCCPP is tested with known substrates of cyto-
chromes P450 (CYP) 1A2 and 3A4 involved in xenobiotics metabolism.
The test results indicate that CCCPP is able to find pathways to the
buried heminic P450 active site even for high molecular weight CYP
3A4 substrates such as two ketoconazoles together, an experimen-
tally observed situation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein concavities play an important role for biological func-
tions at the molecular level such as ligand binding. Knowledge of
proteiniligand binding sites and their access routes contributes to
optimize Virtual screening of chemical libraries and then to pro-
pose new potential drugs. The concavity containing the active
site may be located at various places in the protein. When it is at
the surface of the protein, the concavity is called a pocket, and it
is called a cavity when the active site is buried inside the protein,
in which case the route to the active site is called a channel.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In any case, deﬁning the shape of the protein needs to locate
the boundary between the protein and its void parts. Many al-
gorithms were proposed in the literature to solve this non-trivial
problem. In a recent review (Perot et al., 2010), 20 geometric
algorithms were reported, plus 10 algorithms based either on
genomic information or on energy calculations. These latter
being devoted to proteiniligand complexes energy calculation
by docking (see Sperandio et al., 2006 for a review), they are
outside the scope of this article. We report in Table l a non-
exhaustive list of 35 geometric algorithms and their variants.

There are several ways to classify them. The main criteria are:
(i) the computation is dependent or not on probes spheres
assumed to represent ligands, (ii) the computation is based
either on a rectangular grid or on a Delaunay triangulation or
on none of them. It has to be noticed that building the Delaunay
triangulation of N input vertices in the 3D space consists prac-
tically in partitioning the smallest convex polyhedron enclosing
the N input vertices into non-overlapping adjacent tetrahedra
with endpoints edges at input vertices, such that none interior
of the spheres circumscribed to these tetrahedra contains any of
the input vertices (Edelsbrunner, 1987). The dual structure of the
Delaunay triangulation is the Voronoi diagram (Edelsbrunner,
1987), which, roughly speaking, is the union of the N polyhedral
cells defined from the set of the planes mid-perpendicular to the
sides of these tetrahedra. To each of the input vertices K,
1 5 K 5 N, is associated its polyhedral cell (possibly unbounded)
which is the domain containing all points of the space closest to
K than to any of the N i 1 other vertices. This important prop-
erty explains why Voronoi tessellations were used to Visualize the
shape of proteins, such as in Voro3D (Dupuis, 2003; Dupuis
et al., 2005).

Grid methods offer several drawbacks. The orientation of the
3D grid is arbitrary, and most of the time an increase of the
precision by 10 needs to increase the number of nodes by 103,
thus increasing computing times by 1000. It is the case, when the
measures of cavity volumes are estimated from the number of
nodes or from the number of voxels (i.e. the 3D analogs of
pixels). When the grid nodes are in a graph in which paths are
seeked to identify channels, the number of paths to be enumer-
ated increases exponentially with the number of nodes. To over-
come this problem, the user can deﬁne an arbitrary upper bound

Grid means 3D rectangular or cubic mesh of nodes. Voxels are 3D analogs of pixels. Alpha shapes are substructures of the Delaunay triangulation

of the shortest paths, but in this case the major part of the net-
work of channels is lost.

At the opposite of a grid of Virtual nodes, the Delaunay tri-
angulation of the N atomic centers is more natural, and efﬁcient
algorithms exist, the main one being based on a 4D convex hull
(Preparata and Shamos, 1985; Edelsbrunner, 1987). It is why the
seminal concept of alpha shape appears in most modern pockets
and channels calculation algorithms, as seen in Table 1. This
concept was ﬁrst introduced in the plane by Edelsbrunner
et a]. (1983), and then was generalized to higher dimensional
spaces and proposed for molecular applications by
Edelsbrunner and Miicke (1992). Alpha shapes are a generaliza-
tion of the convex hull of the N points, this latter being the
smallest convex polyhedron enclosing the N points. A spherical
probe sphere of radius alpha erases from the polyhedral hull any
point at distance less than alpha to the sphere center for all
positions where the sphere does not enclose any of the N
points. The resulting object is called an alpha hull. Substituting
straight edges for the circular ones and triangles for the spherical
caps, the ﬁnal object is the alpha shape of the N points set. When
alpha tends to zero, the alpha shape reduces to the N points.
When alpha is large enough, the alpha shape is the convex poly-
hedral hull of the points. For intermediate alpha values, the
alpha shape is not convex and can be used as a model of the
protein shape. The original variant of the alpha shape concept
that we introduce is described in the next section.

2 METHODS
2.1 Approach

Our approach differs from the existing ones based on alpha shapes vari-
ants at three levels: (i) we are interested in the structure of the network of

channels, i.e. the complement of the protein alpha shape to its convex
hull, (ii) we considered several geometric models for the ligand, not only
spheres and (iii) the solid representing a ligand is used to flag the triangu-
lar faces as ‘can be passed’ or ‘cannot be passed’, rather than erasing
edges, triangles and tetrahedra.

The ﬁrst level is of crucial importance when it is necessary to identify
potential access channels to a buried active site, as in cytochromes P450
(Guengerich, 2005): the shape of the channels must be analyzed, not the
shape of the protein. The second level is detailed in Section 2.2, in which it
is shown that the spherical model of ligands is most of the time inad-
equate. The third level can be understood as follows: to travel inside the
polyhedral protein hull, the ligand must pass through some sequence of
triangular faces, each face separating two adjacent tetrahedra, just as
triangular doors can be open or closed in a labyrinth of tetrahedral
rooms: see Section 2.3. The ﬁnal goal is to exhibit the full network of
paths through the labyrinth, or from the exterior of the labyrinth to the
chamber neighboring the hidden active site.

2.2 Ligands shapes analysis

In order to analyze the shapes of the ligands, we report in Table 2 the
statistics for 21 geometric parameters on the dataset of 70 substrates of
the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 used by Meslamani et a]. (2009), con-
taining from 16 to 186 atoms, hydrogens included. The CYP 3A4 sub-
strates are known to offer a wide structural diversity (Rendic, 2002), so it
is why we considered that the statistics on these 70 substrates are
meaningful.

There are several ways to see in Table 2 that the spherical model of
ligands is irrealistic. The ﬁrst way is to look at the sphericity coefﬁcient G,
which is equal to 1 for a sphere and is less than 1 for other solids. It is the
case of our dataset, for which G is always <0.5, but G reﬂects the shape of
the van der Waals solid and thus does not include internal void cavity
volumes although the need to compute them was pointed out (Sonavane
and Chakrabarti, 2008). Also, G depends on the atomic radii values and
there is no agreement about these values (see, for example, some sug-
gested set of values in Gavezzotti, 1983; Richards, 1985; Scott and

Scheraga, 1966; Zeﬁrov and Zorkii, 1989). In fact these values depend on
how they are deﬁned (see Bondi, 1964, for a discussion). Thus we neglect
the atomic spheres and we look at other parameters. The geometric shape
coefﬁcient Ig = (D 7 R)/R (Petitjean, 1992) relates the diameter of the hull
to its radius, but it varies few in this context. Assuming that the shape is
convex, the best shape model is the convex hull of the atomic centers, i.e.
the smallest convex polyhedron containing these centers: by definition,
any other enclosing convex solid will contain this polyhedron. The
observed distribution of the ratio I, of volume of the convex hull to the
volume of the smallest enclosing sphere exhibit a mean value <0.17,
which is quite low, thus proving the inadequation of the sphere model.
However it is much more difﬁcult to test if a convex polyhedron can pass
through pathways without colliding a set of punctual or spherical obs-
tacles rather than testing if a sphere can pass these obstaches without
colliding.

It is why the cylindrical shape was devised for molecules (Petitjean,
2012). A cylinder has a convex shape deﬁned by only two parameters:
radius and height, although a sphere has only one, a rectangular 3D box
has three ones and a polyhedron has many ones. However cylinders are
easier to handle than rectangular boxes for collision tests (see Section 2.3).
Since there are two parameters, there is an inﬁnity of ways to combine
them to define the minimality criterion for a cylindrical solid (e.g. min-
imize its volume or its surface, or else), but we retained only two of them:
the minimal height cylinder which is relevant for rather ﬂat ligands, and
the minimal radius cylinder which is relevant for rather elongated ligands.
Intuitively, the former reﬂects atomic centers distributions for which the
smallest eigenvalue of the inertia matrix (i.e. N times the covariance
matrix) is small compared to the two other eigenvalues, although the
latter reﬂects atomic centers distributions for which two eigenvalues are
small compared to the largest one. We see in Table 2 that the radius of the

minimal height cylinder and the height of the minimal radius cylinder
remain close to 1, although the respective minimized height and mini-
mized radius of these cylinders are significantly <1 . Then the distributions
of the hull volume to the cylinder volume offer values signiﬁcantly <1,
and of the same magnitude than the sphericity coefﬁcient G and than the
volumic shape coefﬁcient 1,, thus conﬁrming the pertinence of the cylin-
drical model over the spherical model. It is of major importance to under-
stand that, although a ligand conformer has a unique shape, it does not
preclude that this unique shape can be modeled through several ways,
such as the minimal height enclosing cylinder, the minimal radius enclos-
ing cylinder, the smallest enclosing sphere (even if that latter encloses a
large void volume) and so 011. Furthermore, it is recalled that most lig-
ands are ﬂexible, and that is a second reason to insist that several realistic
shape models can be simultaneously useful. However, the data of Table 2
show that cylindrical shapes are more realistic than spherical shapes, as
already mentioned in that section and illustrated in Figure 1.

2.3 Geometric tests of passage

In the basic alpha-shape approach, a tetrahedral cell with its circum-
scribed sphere of radius alpha can contain a spherical probe ligand of
radius alpha (protein atomic spheres are neglected). Assuming that the
circumcenter is in the tetrahedra (it is most of the time the case), the
spherical ligand cannot exit from the tetrahedra because each radius of
the four circles circumscribed to the triangular faces is smaller than alpha.
Thus the knowledge of the standard protein alpha shape does not sufﬁce
to conclude that the ligand can travel in a channel: a ligand is ensured to
travel in a channel if and only if it passes through its associated sequence
of triangular faces, and that is a major originality of our approach.

To implement this approach we consider the graph of the Delaunay
triangulation, in which the N nodes of the graph are the tetrahedra and

Fig. 1. The ketoconazole, a known CYP 3A4 substrate, modeled by its
minimal enclosing sphere (R = 10.10A) and by its minimal height enclos-
ing cylinder (half height: Hh = 2.4A; Rh: 10.0 A)

the edges of the graph are the triangular faces, i.e. two adjacent tetrahedra
are two nodes joined by a non-directed edge. This graph, which underlies
the Voronoi diagram structure, is called here the ‘facial graph’ and must
not be confused with the one where the nodes are the atoms and the edges
are the sides of the tetrahedra. Each node of the facial graph has at most
four neighbors. Optionnally, a dummy node representing the exterior of
the convex hull can be added to the graph, in which case each of the N
nodes has exactly four neighbors. Then it sufﬁces to perform a loop on
the edges (i.e. the triangles) of the facial graph and ﬂag the ones which
cannot be passed by the ligand as deleted edges. The resulting network of
channels is a subgraph of the facial graph, not necessarily connected.
The most difﬁcult task is to decide whether or not an object (the
ligand) can pass through a triangle. It is hard in the case of a non-
convex object, and even for convex objects such as a polyhedral hull or
a straight box it is not trivial to do. In fact the problem is to deﬁne the
criterion for passage rather than to compute if yes or no the passage is
possible once its criterion is deﬁned. Thus we followed a simpliﬁed ap-
proach: we considered punctual atoms and then we deﬁned a passage test
through a triangle for the two cylindrical models under the assumption
that we can neglect collisions with atoms not at the triangle vertices.
For cylinders with a ratio radius/height sufﬁciently close to zero, the
smallest planar projected section of the cylinder is its circular section
because its 2D image can be contained in any of its other planar projected
sections. The axis of the cylinder is optimally set orthogonal to the plane
of the triangle and we are left to a 2D problem. Then, we ﬂag the passage
test as being successful in two cases (a) or (b): (a) the triangle is acute and
the radius of the circular section (i.e. the one of the cylinder) is smaller
than the circumradius of the triangle, or (b) the triangle is obtuse and the
circular section of the cylinder does not contain any of the triangle ver-
tices when the center of this circular section is constrained to lie in the
triangle. In the case (a), the largest possible cylinder radius is the circum-
radius, and in case (b) it is the distance from the vertex at the opposite of
the largest side to the point at the intersection of the largest side and of
the mid-perpendicular of the second largest side. In both cases (a) and (b),
the center of the circular section must pass inside the triangle, not outside
(the passage of a punctual solid through a 3D triangle is always deﬁned).

It should be noticed that the tests (a) and (b) are rigorous in the case of
the largest section of a spherical ligand, for which the condition of a lack
of collision with a fourth vertex can be relaxed.

For cylinders with a ratio height/radius sufﬁciently close to zero, the
axis of the cylinder is optimally set parallel to the plane of the triangle and
we are left to a 2D problem. The cylinder height is also the distance
between the two closest parallel planes enclosing the ligand. Here, still
under the assumption that we can neglect collisions with atoms not at the
triangle vertices, we ﬂag the passage test as being successful when the
cylinder height is smaller than the largest height of the triangle (or than
the second largest side of the triangle when it is obtuse). This passage test
can be applied with the same limitations as above to any ligand shape
provided that we know the distance between the two closest slabs enclos-
ing the ligand, this latter distance being equal to the height of the smallest
height cylinder deﬁned in Section 2.2.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To exemplify how works CCCPP, we first considered the CYP
1A2, which is known to accept rather ﬂat substrates (Sridhar
et al., 2011; Zaretzki et al., 2012). The data were extracted
from the crystallized complex of the 1A2 with a-naphtoﬂavone,
PDB code 2HI4. The ﬂatness, i.e. the thickness of the ligand, is
deﬁned as 2Hh (see Table 2). Figure 2 shows that ligands of
thickness 4.5  and higher can access to surface pockets although
no pathway is found to the buried heminic site. Lowering this
critical value from 45A to 4.45 A, the network of channels avail-
able to the ligand appears in front of the distal face of the heme,
and CCCPP indicates that the network connects the exterior of
the enzyme to the active site. When Visualized in superimposition
of the channel computed for a 4.45A critical value, the ﬂat
ligand of the complex (0.32 A) appears indeed in this predicted
channel, in front of the distal face of the heme. A remarkable
result is that all parts of the central area of the access channel
become unavailable quasi simultaneously for any ligand of thick-
ness slightly increasing from 0.05A above the critical value of
45A although the surface pockets are still available for ligands
of thickness 4.5 Another result is that the network of channels
does not reduce to a small number of chains of nodes: there is
NOT a small number of channels, and counting them is mean-
ingless, at the opposite to what seems intuitively suggested by
some other channels modeling approaches (see Table 1). CCCPP
provides relevant information on this complex network rather
than outputting a misleading small number of paths, and the
full network structure can be stored both in a text file and in a

The CYP 3A4 is known to accept a much wider diversity of
substrates than the 1A2 (Rendic, 2002), some of them being very
large. The case of the ketoconazole is of special interest. Its
radius, as defined in Table 2, is 10.1, and its thickness is 4.8
A conformational study showed that only a limited number of
conformers sufﬁces to handle ﬂexibility (Benkaidali et al., 2012),
and the effect on the radius and on the thickness can be neglected
to compute the network of channels. A crystallized complex con-
taining two ketoconazoles is available, PDB code 2VOM. There
are four chains A, B, C, D in the PDB ﬁle. Only surface residues
are missing in chains A and D, so that no reconstruction is
needed for these chains in our context. The 3D similarity between
chains A and D was checked with the SDM algorithm (Petitjean,
1998) after 3D alignment of the two backbones. Only the C0, of

ligands of, respectively, 450 A (top) and 4.45 A (bottom) thickness, visua-
lized with PyMOL. For clarity, the channels are superimposed with the
ligand (oc-naphtoﬂavone) of the CYP 1A2 complex, pdb code 2HI4.
Edges indicate the pathways in the network, except for the ligand and
for the heme, where edges indicate chemical bonds

ARG 212 was outside the maximal common 3D motif, thus we
neglected this difference and we considered only the chain A.
Using a passage test based on a spherical model (it is an
option in CCCPP), CCCPP did not ﬁnd any access to the
heme. However CCCPP indeed found an access for the cylin-
drical model. Figure 3 shows that the two ketoconazoles are
indeed in the predicted channels, one in front of the distal face
of the heme, and the other one just above in a dead end part of
the network.

CCCPP outputs many surface pockets. It is of interest to ob-
serve that they can be used. Figure 4 shows such a situation for
the complex of the CYP 3A4 with progesterone, PDB code
IWOF.

CCCPP can predict channels from the 3D structure of the
enzyme without the help of a complex. We used two 3A4 struc-
tures crystallized without ligand, lTQN and IWOE. Due to miss-
ing residues, we reconstruct the mid of the sequence with
HYDRO_PDB (Azuara et £11., 2006). Figure 5 shows the results
of CCCPP for two 3A4 structures found in the PDB, codes

Fig. 4. The facial graph of the CYP 3A4 channels network available for
the progesterone, retrieved from PDB data, code 1WOF, visualized with
PyMOL. The progesterone lies on a pocket surface on the top

1TQN and IWOE. Both the initial spatial structures and the re-
constructed ones slightly differ, but the central part of the chan-
nels network is visible in front of the distal face of the heme. The
critical thickness above which the access to the heme disappears
was computed at 6.25A (1TQN) and at 5.25A (1WOE). The
same values were got without reconstruction.

The critical thickness has been computed for other 3A4 com-
plexes, such as with metyrapone and ritonavir, PDB codes
1WOG and 3NXU, respectively. For 3NXU, there are two
chains A and B. For these letters, the SDM algorithm did not
found signiﬁcant differences between the backbones: all the 457
CO, were in the common 3D motif. The critical thickness was
5.0A for 1WOG and 6.0A for 3NXU. All critical thickness
values we computed for the 3A4 ranged in the interval 5—6A.
The differences are interpretable in terms of malleability of the
enzyme: some CYPs have been observed to adopt different open
and closed conformations when bound to different ligands Wu
et al., 2013).

No objective numerical criterion exists to compare channels
computed from different algorithms. That fact is mainly due to
the deep differences in the nature of the output produced by the
softwares, thus introducing a major difﬁculty to compare chan-
nels. For instance, let us compare the channels of the CYP 3A4
computed by Cojocaru et al. (2007) with CAVER, cited in
Table 1. The main differences are:

0 CCCPP produced channels depending on the shape and size
of the ligand, i.e. the routes sterically available to a small
ligand were more numerous that the routes available to a
large ligand, although CAVER produced ‘universal’ chan-
nels, i.e. independent of the ligand.

0 CCCPP concluded about the sterical ability of a given ligand
to pass or not through the channels, although CAVER did
not.

0 Owing to the examples presented in this section for the CYP
3A4, CCCPP found a complex topology of the network of
channels, all of them being in intersection, although three
3A4 channels are mentioned by Cojocaru et al. (2007).

 

Fig. 5. The facial graph of the CYP 3A4 channels network retrieved from
PDB data, codes 1TQN (top) and 1WOE (bottom), visualized with
PyMOL

Since these CAVER channels (visually, sequences of intersect-
ing spheres) were described from their closeness (not numerical)
to speciﬁc loops and helices of the CYP 3A4, it is impossible to
compute some degree of similarity they offer with our single
network of channels got for a speciﬁc ligand. Nevertheless, on
the basis of a visual checking, the egress of the CAVER channels
were found to be seemingly correct by CCCPP, although the
network we found was not indicated by CAVER. CYP 3A4
channels were brieﬂy evoked by Berka et al. (2012) as an example
of use of a MOLE2, a variant of MOLE, this latter being con-
sidered as returning similar results to CAVER (Petrek et al.,
2007). The authors of MOLE2 found four channels but did
not perform channels comparisons with the three CAVER chan-
nels mentioned above, although CAVER and MOLE are algo-
rithms having much in common. Anyway, we insist that the user
must restrict channels comparisons to results produced by a
common software, or at least produced by softwares based on
similar algorithms. CCCPP computes only voids, not binding
sites. Numerical comparisons of void calculations need at least
that there exist computer representations of the voids as numer-
ical objects. Even though these computerized objects are unam-
biguously deﬁned, most of the times they have deeply different
meanings because they are issued from different methods.

Computing cavities, channels, pores and pockets in proteins

 

Comparing objects of deeply different nature is not always pos-
sible because it needs to deﬁne a numerical criterion to compare
these objects. It is stressed that the objects differ in nature, not by
the values of their measured parameters: there is no list of par-
ameters common to the objects. In the case of CCCPP, the
computerized objects are non-connected graphs, in which each
node of the graph is associated to a tetrahedra (but not to an
atom) of the Delaunay triangulation of the protein. Actually
none of the methods cited in Table 1 offers a computer repre-
sentation compatible with the one of CCCPP (thus CCCPP
offers indeed a new insight on the voids), even with those
based on Delaunay triangulations (e.g. CASTp, MOLE), thus
precluding extensive numerical comparisons with the help of
data banks. This is a major difference with the computation of
binding sites, because these latter can be checked from experi-
mental values stored in data banks.

The examples given in this section are for illustration of our
methodology: a deeper investigation of the CYP450 channels is
outside the scope of this article. Reviews on speciﬁc members of
this enzyme’s family are available in Wade et al. (2004) and in
Cojocaru et al. (2007). The computing times were around 2min
on linux and macosx workstations. Nearly a half of this time is
devoted to compute the Delaunay triangulation, and most of the
rest of the time is used to generate the output molecular file
containing the network for display. Once the triangulation
done, finding pathways for a ligand from the exterior of the
protein to an end point in the center of the enzyme is done in
less than Is. Also, we point out that CCCPP did not predict
binding pockets. Computing pockets can be a preliminary step
to the computation of binding pockets, but the latter problem is
out of the scope of that paper [see Chen et al. (2011) for a recent
review].

4 CONCLUﬁON

We presented a new algorithm to compute cavities, channels and
pockets in proteins, and we developed a software called CCCPP
which implements this algorithm and outputs the full network of
cavities. The void parts are bounded by the convex hull of the
atoms of the protein. The structure of the network is stored in a
text ﬁle and is written in a molecular file to be displayed with any
molecular viewer. It was proved that cylindrical ligands shapes
are much more realistic than spherical ligands shapes. On the
basis of this unusual cylindrical model, CCCPP was successful
in explaining how large molecules can be admitted in front of the
buried heminic active site of CYP450s. For these latter, CCCPP
indicated that there is a complex network of channels rather than
a small finite number of channels. It also indicated that the ﬁnal
part of the network in front of the heme lies at its distal face,
which is in agreement with physico chemical data. We do not
claim that our methodology is superior to the tenths of available
other ones. We just point out that our methodology gave rise to
an alternative tool providing new information about pockets and
channels in proteins. It can be used in a virtual screening context,
eventually in addition to energy-based methods.

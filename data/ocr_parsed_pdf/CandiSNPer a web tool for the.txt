ABSTRACT

Summary: Human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips
which are used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) permit
the genotyping of up to 4 million SNPs simultaneously. To date, about
1000 human SNPs have been identified as statistically significantly
associated with a disease or another trait of interest. The identified
SNP is not necessarily the causal variant, but it is rather in linkage
disequilibrium (LD) with it. CandiSNPer is a software tool that
determines the LD region around a significant SNP from a GWAS.
It provides a list with functional annotation and LD values for the
SNPs found in the LD region. This list contains not only the SNPs for
which genotyping data are available, but all SNPs with rs-le, thus
increasing the likelihood to include the causal variant. Furthermore,
plots showing the LD values are generated. CandiSNPer facilitates
the preselection of candidate SNPs for causal variants.

Availability and Implementation: The CandiSNPer server is
freely available at http://www2.hu-berlin.de/wikizbnutztier/software/
CandiSNPer. The source code is available to academic users ‘as is’
upon request. The web site is implemented in Perl and R and runs
on an Apache server. The Ensembl database is queried for SNP data
via Perl APls.

1 INTRODUCTION

Whole-genome genotyping has become established in medical,
biological and agricultural research to elucidate the genetic basis
of phenotypic traits such as disease or economically important
features. Typically, the result of a genome-wide association study
(GWAS) consists of a list of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) with P-values that Characterize the strength of association
with the phenotype under investigation. Further analysis is necessary
to associate a signiﬁcant SNP with a gene or to decide if a signiﬁcant
SNP is a candidate for a causal variant for a disease or just in linkage
disequilibrium (LD) with it. A causal variant is a genomic locus that
has a direct qualitative or quantitative effect on the phenotype. SNPs
can alter a protein directly (non-synonymous SNPs, stop gained or
stop lost SNPs, frameshift SNPs or SNPs in splice sites) or they can
inﬂuence gene expression if they are located in regulatory regions.
SNAP (Johnson et (11., 2008) proved to be a valuable tool for the
analysis of SNPs that are in LD with a signiﬁcant SNP, but has the

shortcoming that only SNPs that are present on SNP Chips of the
major genotyping platforms are considered.

The main motivation to develop CandiSNPer was that much more
human SNPs are known than systematically genotyped within the
HapMap project or included on the major genotyping platforms.
These SNPs represent potential candidate SNPs for causal variants,
although they will not be observed directly as signiﬁcant SNP in
a GWAS. The number of reference SNPs (rs-SNPs) is currently
17 804034 (dbSNP build 130; genome build 36.3), of which
6573584 are validated. In the Caucasian population, 4030 774
SNPs were genotyped by the HapMap project (Thorisson et al.,
2005) (release #27, February 2009) and 4 million SNPs can be typed,
for example, with Illumina’s HumanOmnil-Quad BeadChip. Thus,
restricting the search for the causal variant of a phenotype to SNPs
present on a genotyping Chip or to HapMap SNPs would mean to
neglect three-quarters of all known SNPs.

To simplify the maintenance of CandiSNPer and to guarantee up-
to-dateness genotype and SNP data are retrieved from the Ensembl
database during runtime. This is at the cost of a response time
that is higher than if primary data were stored locally and LD was
precomputed.

2 METHODS

For a given SNP (termed start-SNP) that was found signiﬁcant in a GWAS.
all HapMap-SNPS of a certain population in a ﬂanking region of user-deﬁned
length (default: 300 kb up- and downstream) are fetched from the Ensembl
database. r2 and D’ are calculated between these SNPs and the start-SNP.
The ﬁrst and last SNP on the ﬂanking region with an r2 (or D’ . respectively)
value above a user-deﬁned threshold (default: 0.2) are considered as start
and end. respectively. of the LD region around the start-SNP. Next. all SNPs
with rsIDs in the LD region are listed with basic annotation: functional class.
position. r2 and D’ with the start-SNP. nearest gene and distance to it as well
as the difference between observed and expected conservation score (Cooper
et al.. 2005). Hyperlinks to the SNP and the gene are provided in a HTML
list. A plot showing r2 or D’ for all HapMap SNPs in the ﬂanking region
versus the chromosomal position is generated for download in ﬁve formats.
The positions of non-HapMap SNPs are indicated as ticks on the x-axis. The
user can assign colors to the data points so that SNPs belonging to different
functional classes can be distinguished. Runtime for one start-SNP is ~5 min
for a set of 100 individuals and 3000 SNPs. The CandiSNPer web interface
is programmed in HTML/Perl CGI (V 5.8) code. running on an Apache web
server (V1.3.37). Graphics are created by R (V 2.6.2).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Analysis of signiﬁcant SNPs in intergenic regions

Intergenic SNPs are SNPs that are located at least Skb up- or
downstream of a gene. In general, they are not associated with a

gene and not located in a known regulatory region. We applied
CandiSNPer to all 545 intergenic SNPs which were at present
found in the Caucasian population signiﬁcantly associated with a
phenotype (Hindorff et al., 2009). Table 1 lists the number of cases
in which LD regions around these SNPs host SNPs of ﬁinctional
classes that are deemed as strong candidates for a causal variant. In
almost half of the cases at least one candidate SNP is located in the
LD region around a signiﬁcant intergenic SNP. In more than half of
the cases, however, no such candidate SNP could be identiﬁed. This
suggests that the identiﬁcation of causal variants will remain a hard
problem.

3.2 Example: analysis of an intergenic SNPs associated
with LDL cholesterol

As an example, we studied all SNPs that are in the LD region

of rs562338, an intergenic SNP ~2lkb downstream of APOB

on chromosome 2 that was found to be associated with LDL

between this SNP and SNPs in its vicinity. The LD region extends
between ~21.1 and ~2l.5 Mb (perpendicular lines). The horizontal
line shows the average of r2 values for scrambled genotypes
plus 3 standard deviations ((rz) =0.018, SD=0.025; (D’) =0.12,
SD = 0.09). We extracted all reference SNPs in the LD region around
this SNP and identiﬁed candidate SNPs a selection of which is listed
in Table 2. They can have an effect on the ﬁinctioning of the genes
they are located in. The frameshift and stop gained SNPs are even
likely to have a severe effect on the 3D conformation of the protein
that APOB is coding for.

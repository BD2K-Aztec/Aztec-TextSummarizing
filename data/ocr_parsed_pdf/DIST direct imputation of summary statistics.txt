ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genotype imputation methods are used to enhance the
resolution of genome-wide association studies, and thus increase the
detection rate for genetic signals. Although most studies report all
univariate summary statistics, many of them limit the access to sub-
ject-level genotypes. Because such an access is required by all geno-
type imputation methods, it is helpful to develop methods that impute
summary statistics without going through the interim step of imputing
genotypes. Even when subject-level genotypes are available, due to
the substantial computational cost of the typical genotype imputation,
there is a need for faster imputation methods.

Results: Direct Imputation of summary STatistics (DIST) imputes the
summary statistics of untyped variants without first imputing their sub-
ject-level genotypes. This is achieved by (i) using the conditional ex-
pectation formula for multivariate normal variates and (ii) using the
correlation structure from a relevant reference population. When com-
pared with genotype imputation methods, DIST (i) requires only a frac-
tion of their computational resources, (ii) has comparable imputation
accuracy for independent subjects and (iii) is readily applicable to the
imputation of association statistics coming from large pedigree data.
Thus, the proposed application is useful for a fast imputation of sum-
mary results for (i) studies of unrelated subjects, which (a) do not pro-
vide subject-level genotypes or (b) have a large size and (ii) family
association studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been successful
in detecting associations between genetic variants and complex
diseases (Hindorff et al., 2009). However, GWASs genotype only
a fraction of the tens of millions of single nucleotide polymorph-
isms (SNPs) found in the human genome. To increase resolution,
and thus the detection rate for genetic signals, researchers
proposed imputing genotypes at numerous untyped

(unmeasured) SNPs (de Bakker et al., 2006; Li et al., 2009;
Marchini and Howie, 2010).

Most commonly used genotype imputation tools, e.g.
IMPUTE2 (Howie et al., 2009), MACH (Li et al., 2010),
BIMBAM (SerVin and Stephens, 2007) and BEAGLE
(Browning and Browning, 2007), are based on Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs). Although these methods are accurate, due to
their need for haplotypic phasing of all subjects in the study, they
are extremely burdensome computationally. Their computa-
tional burden would become even more extreme with the ever
increasing size of studies and reference panels. Other genotype
imputation methods [PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007), SNPMSTAT
(Lin et al., 2008), UNPHASED (Dudbridge, 2008) and TUNA
(Wen and Nicolae, 2008)] are based on multinomial models
(MMs) of haplotype frequencies instead of HMM. These meth-
ods are simpler and faster, but their imputation accuracy is gen-
erally lower than the accuracy of HMM-based methods
(Marchini and Howie, 2008, 2010). Recently, researchers pro-
posed a new MM-based imputation method, called BLIMP,
which imputes genotypes/allele frequencies for unmeasured
SNPs by using the conditional expectation formula for multivari-
ate normal Variates (Wen and Stephens, 2010). Regardless of
their model usage, all these imputation tools require a two-
stage procedure that (i) imputes subject-level genotypes at the
unmeasured SNPs on the basis of genotypes at measured SNPs
and a relevant reference population [e.g. 1000 Genomes (lKG)
(Altshuler et al., 2010)] and (ii) tests for association between
imputed genotypes and phenotype of interest. However, this pro-
cedure requires access to subject-level genotypes, which are often
unavailable.

To directly impute summary statistics while (i) substantially
reducing the computational burden and (ii) retaining imputation
accuracy, we propose Direct Imputation of summary STatistics
(DIST). DIST avoids the imputation of subject-level genotypes
by directly applying, to unmeasured SNP statistics, the classical
conditional expectation formula for multivariate normal
variates.

DIST imputes the statistics at the unmeasured SNPs in a predic-
tion window as a function of (i) the statistics at measured SNPs
in a larger window, henceforth denoted as extended window, and
(ii) the correlation matrix of both measured and unmeasured
statistics, as estimated from a relevant reference dataset.
Similar to BLIMP (Wen and Stephens, 2010), DIST uses the

conditional mean formula for multivariate normal variates.
Unlike BLIMP, DIST applies the formula (i) directly to sum-
mary statistics and (ii) under the null hypothesis, i.e. the hypoth-
esis under which the distribution of all statistical tests is
computed. This novel application allows the imputation of sum-
mary statistics without imputing subject-level genotypes (see
Section 1.1 in Supplementary Material). To reduce computation
time, DIST is implemented in C++, which ensures that it can be
easily used under Linux, Windows, MacOS etc. DIST takes as
input a file containing the (normally distributed) GWAS/meta—
analysis summary statistics (see Section 1.5 of Supplementary
Material for more information on obtaining the normally dis-
tributed statistics). It provides a command line interface with
various options for specifying the number of measured SNPs
to be contained in (i) the prediction window and (ii) each side
region of the extended window, and so forth (Supplementary
Table S1).

3 RESULTS

We compare the performance of DIST with the performance
of typical HMM and MM methods. Given the speed and accur-
acy of SHAPEIT phasing (Delaneau et al., 2012), we chose
IMPUTE2 as the representative for the HMM-based methods.
Given its wide availability, we chose PLINK as the representa-
tive for the MM-based methods. Thus, we compare the perform-
ance of DIST, IMPUTE2 and PLINK (at default settings) to
predict 99 imputed height SNPs in 25 realistic simulations
under both the null and the alternative hypothesis (Fig. 1). The
phenotypes (height) of 5000 subjects are simulated as a function
of the effects at the 180 signiﬁcant SNPs from the height meta-
analysis (Lango et al., 2010) (Section 2 in Supplementary
Material). Imputations used Europeans in lKG as the reference
sample and were performed on a single Linux machine (Intel
Xeon 2.67 GHz processor and 64 GB of RAM).

The average accuracy of imputed Z—scores in the above 50
simulations, as measured by the squared correlation coefﬁcient
(r2) between imputed and true Z—scores, is high for DIST (0.98)
and IMPUTE2 (0.99) and moderately high for PLINK (0.92)
(Fig. 1). The average running time per simulation was 76min
for DIST, 270/965 min for imputing/pre—phasing for IMPUTE2

and 3971 min for PLINK. The maximum memory requirement
was 52MB for DIST, ~9500MB for IMPUTE2 and 5300MB
for PLINK. [DIST and IMPUTE2 were also used to impute the
statistics for 5% SNPs missing at random on chromosome 22 of
a dataset of 5000 subjects (which included the data described in
the next paragraph); DIST required 33min of running time and
at most 283 MB of memory, and IMPUTE2 required 846/
3437 min for imputation/pre-phasing and 9470MB of memory]

To impute untyped statistics, DIST requires only the joint
correlation matrix for the statistics at typed and untyped
SNPs. Because this matrix does not depend on the relationship
between subjects in the study, unlike genotype imputation meth-
ods, DIST can be readily used to impute statistics for family
association studies. We illustrate this advantage by applying
the method to a proprietary Irish alcohol dependence study
sample consisting of 1755 controls and 710 cases from 431
Irish families. The subjects were genotyped using Affymetrix
6.0 SNP array, and the association statistics were computed
using MQLS (Thornton and McPeek, 2007). To impute unmeas-
ured SNPs, we used UK10K (www.uk10k.org) as the reference
panel (Supplementary Fig. S2).

4 CONCLUSIONS

DIST is a novel tool for direct imputation of summary statistics
at untyped SNPs. When compared with genotype imputation
methods, DIST (i) does not need access to subject-level geno-
types, (ii) provides comparable imputation accuracy while sub-
stantially shortening the running time and (iii) can be readily
applied to family association statistics. Consequently, DIST is
useful for investigators who need fast and fairly accurate access
to imputation-based P-Values but (i) do not have access to sub-
ject-level genotypes, (ii) do not want to go through the laborious
process of imputing subject-level genotypes or (iii) have associ-
ation statistics coming from (large) pedigree data. Unlike geno-
type imputation methods, as the available reference panels are
increasing in size, DIST can avoid incurring large increases in
running time/memory by storing the local correlation structures
into pre-computed tables.

When compared with genotype imputation methods, DIST
uses a smaller imputation window and requires that study and

reference populations to be well matched. Thus, when access to
subject-level genotypic data is available, genotype imputation
methods are likely to outperform DIST (i) for regions with
long-range linkage disequilibrium, e.g. major histocompatibility
complex locus, and (ii) when the study and the reference popu-
lations are not well matched. Consequently, whenever possible/
appropriate, we recommend to follow-up DIST signals using a
genotype imputation method.

ABSTRACT

Summary: CytoSEED is a Cytoscape plugin for viewing,
manipulating and analyzing metabolic models created using
the Model SEED. The CytoSEED plugin enables users of the Model
SEED to create informative visualizations of the reaction networks
generated for their organisms of interest. These visualizations are
useful for understanding organism-specific biochemistry and for
highlighting the results of flux variability analysis experiments.
Availability and Implementation: Freely available for download on
the web at http://sourceforge.net/projects/cytoseed/. Implemented
in Java SE 6 and supported on all platforms that support Cytoscape.
Contact: dejongh@hope.edu

Supplementary information: Installation instructions, a tutorial, and
full-size figures are available at http://www.cs.hope.edu/cytoseed/.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Model SEED (http://www.theseed.org/models) is a web-based
resource for the automatic generation of metabolic models from
prokaryotic genome sequences (Henry et al., 2010). These models
are automatically gap-ﬁlled by adding reactions that enable the
model to produce all speciﬁed components of the organism’s
biomass. Although the Model SEED provides extensive capabilities
for viewing and running analyses on these metabolic models, the
graphical displays of the biochemical reaction networks are limited
to static KEGG pathway maps (Kanehisa et al., 2006). CytoSEED
provides Model SEED users with a complementary means of
visualizing their metabolic models using Cytoscape (Shannon et al.,
2003). Cytoscape is an open-source software platform for dynamic,
graphical visualization, manipulation and analysis of networks. The
CytoSEED plugin extends Cytoscape to enable users to load a
metabolic model from the Model SEED, sort the reaction network
into metabolic pathways, and modify the pathway visualizations to
create the representations they ﬁnd most informative. Through this
process, users are able to identify and represent connections in the
biochemical reaction network that are not readily apparent in the
KEGG pathway maps. CytoSEED also enables users to display the
results of ﬂux variability analysis experiments for visualization
in the context of a metabolic model, and to compare multiple
models.

2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

CytoSEED provides a menu with options to load a model
into a Cytoscape session, save a model session, and reopen a
model session. To load a model, the user must enter the Model
SEED identiﬁer for the model; a Model SEED username and
password are also required for loading private models. CytoSEED
downloads the model data from the Model SEED web-server and
stores it in a speciﬁed folder on the user’s machine to speed
up loading during subsequent sessions. When the download is
complete, CytoSEED processes the model data, sorting the reactions
into networks based on their association with KEGG pathways.
A network is created for every KEGG pathway associated with the
model reactions, so some reactions may be displayed in multiple
networks; for example, the pyruvate kinase reaction is present
in both the Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis and the Carbon Fixation
in photosynthetic organisms pathways, so models containing this
reaction will result in the creation of separate networks for both
pathways. Every network corresponding to a KEGG pathway
is formatted to match the layout of the static KEGG pathway
map using the kgmlreader plugin (freely available at http://Code.
google.com/p/kgmlreader/), if installed. In addition, CytoSEED
creates several other networks to group common model reactions
not generally associated with KEGG pathways, such as transport
reactions. Finally, CytoSEED creates a network with the same name
as the model identiﬁer to group any leftover reactions (e.g., the
Seed243273.1 Network in Figure 1).

After the networks have been created, CytoSEED uses ﬂux
variability analysis results for any biomass production from the
Model SEED to color the reactions based on the following
categories: (1) Essential reactions, which must carry a non-zero ﬂux
to produce biomass, are colored gold; (2) Active reactions, which
can carry a non-zero ﬂux but are not essential, are colored blue;
(3) Inactive reactions, which cannot carry a ﬂux, are colored grey;
and (4) Gap-ﬁlled reactions, which are automatically added by the
Model SEED to complete the reaction network and are thus essential
for any biomass production, are colored purple. Compounds are also
colored based on several categories; see the legend in the lower
right-hand corner of Figure l for details.

The Maps panel on the right-hand side of the Cytoscape desktop
displays each network name and the number of total and unique
reactions in the network. Using context menus associated with
the Maps panel and each network, the user can create new
networks, delete existing networks, and move or copy reactions
between networks. Figure 1 displays the result of reﬁning the
Mycoplasma genitalium G-37 model visualization by deleting

extraneous networks such as the Carbon ﬁxation pathway, and
moving reactions to ﬁll gaps in other pathways. A tutorial that
steps the user through this process in more detail is available in
the Supplementary information.

CytoSEED provides a dynamic visualization of a metabolic
model that is useﬁil for understanding the organism-speciﬁc
biochemistry represented in the model. For example, M. genitalium
is missing a gene for transaldolase, which converts the compound
erythrose-4-phosphate into sedoheptulose-7-phosphate. This results
in a gap in KEGG’s static Pentose phosphate pathway map.
However, two other reactions present in the model can bridge
this gap, using sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphate as an intermediary
compound. CytoSEED enables the user to move these reactions
into the network representing the Pentose phosphate pathway,
resulting in a visualization of the pathway that demonstrates it is
complete and ﬁinctioning in the model. CytoSEED also provides the
capability of switching among the various ﬂux variability analysis
results available for a given model from the Model SEED web-
server. For example, the M. genitalium model has results for both
Complete (i.e., all transportable compounds are in the media) and
SP4 media. Using the CytoSEED menu, the user can switch from
the Complete media results to the SP4 media results, and the
coloring of reactions is immediately updated, showing, e.g., that the
glucose-phosphotransferase transport reaction switches from active
to essential in the SP4 media.

CytoSEED also includes the capability of comparing multiple
metabolic models in one Cytoscape session. See the tutorial for
details.

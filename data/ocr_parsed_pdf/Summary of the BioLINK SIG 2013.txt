2.3 Use of text-mined data for biological data analysis

Our keynote speaker, Lars Juhl Jensen, presented his work on
‘pragmatic’ text mining of clinical records (Jensen et al., 2012) as
well as the biomedical literature (Jensen et al., 2006), in which he
highlighted the important role that text mining can play in bio—
medical applications when it enables large—scale identification of
concept co—occurrences. Mining of such relationships among
entities can identify signiﬁcant hidden associations.

Kissa et a]. developed a novel relatedness measure for chem—
ical compounds, which integrates a text—based similarity meas—
ure for nominal features (terms from a controlled vocabulary)
or free text fields (Kissa et al., 2013). Hettne et a]. explore the
use of background knowledge in pathway databases and litera—
ture to make sense of single nucleotide polymorphism emetabol—
ite pairs from genome—wide association studies (Hettne et al.,
2013).

Two contributions to the workshop addressed the interplay
between text and structured knowledge resources, from distinct
perspectives: Kim and Cohen (Kim and Cohen, 2013) propose a
natural language—based query interface to an underlying struc—
tured resources, whereas Garcia et al. (2013c) propose aggrega—
tion of context extracted from multiple documents into problem—
dependent self—describing research objects.

3 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK

Textual sources such as clinical text and the biomedical literature
are rich sources of knowledge, and text—mining tools aim to ex—
tract and structure that knowledge. The diversity of topics in the
BioLINK SIG 2013 reﬂects a field in transition: the increasing
availability of concept annotations, alongside the increasing
speciﬁcity and complexity of events being tackled for relation
extraction, are making possible the use of text—mined data in
problems where the primary objective is understanding a biolo—
gical mechanism or a clinical relationship. We anticipate seeing
text mining play an increasing role in translational bioinfor—
matics and systems biology models.

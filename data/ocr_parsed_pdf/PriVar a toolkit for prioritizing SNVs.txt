their functional impact is evaluated based on the prediction values of
non-synonymous SNVs caused by the indel after a Sidak’s correction.

2.4 Candidate gene identiﬁcation

PriSNV contains six candidate gene selection functions to help choose a
subset of genes of high interest for further analysis. The strategies for
selection are controlled by the users depending on the data in hand and
the assumptions for a particular study. These strategies can be used in
conjunction with each other to increase power and to reduce search space.

2.4.] Linkage—based strategy If multiple family members are
affected, the genes within long identity-by-descent (IBD) regions shared
by affected family members can be identiﬁed. Because of high noise
of sequencing data, PriSNV only uses common SNV sites existing in
HapMap for corresponding populations and follows a no-violation rule
for identification of IBD sharing, while the haplotype allele frequency is
also calculated to help evaluate the probability of sharing by chance
(Supplementary Material).

2.4.2 Runs of homozygosity For diseases observed in families of
consanguineous marriages family, it is highly likely that the causal mu-
tation is in a region of run of homozygosity (ROH). The ROH regions
are identified using only common SNVs and should satisfy the same
criteria defined for IBD regions, similar to what we reported before
(Zhang et al., 2011). ROH may also indicate large deletions or unipar-
ental disomy.

2.4.3 ‘DoubIe—hit’ on a gene If recessive inheritance is assumed for
a disease, genes carrying homozygous mutations or potential compound
heterozygous variants will be identified by PriVar. Because phase is usu-
ally unknown, all genes with more than one rare non-synonymous SNV
or indel will be highlighted for further analysis (Supplementary Material).

2.4.4 Mutation burden Because of genetic heterogeneity, muta-
tions may be enriched in disease-related genes, although they may
occur at different positions. PriSNV prioritizes the genes based on the
percentage of patients carrying one or more rare non-synonymous SNVs
or indels for a gene (Supplementary Material).

2.4.5 De novo mutations The de novo mutations occur during mei-
osis and only appear in a child but not the parents. If parental data are
available and have high coverage and quality on the same position, the
rare non-synonymous de novo SNVs/indels will be identified as potential
causal mutations.

2.4.6 Disease candidate genes Candidate genes are selected based
on previous studies on the disease. Well-established relationship between
genes and diseases is extracted from Phenopedia database of HuGE
Navigator (Yu et al., 2008). In addition, customized gene list is also
accepted from users to pinpoint the candidate variants from those genes.

3 DATA AND RESULT

PriVar was applied to whole exome sequencing data from a
patient affected by early—onset Crohn’s disease. Raw reads were

aligned to human reference genome hgl9 using Burrows—Wheeler
Aligner (BWA) (Li and Durbin, 2009) followed by Genome
Analysis Toolkit (GATK) data processing pipeline to obtain vari—
ant calls (SNV and Indel) (Supplementary Material). Cutoff on
sequencing depth was determined based on SNP call concordance
between sequencing and SNP chip data, Ti/Tv ratio and indel
length distribution (Supplementary Fig. S3). A 10—fold cutoff
was determined to be an appropriate criterion for filtering out
most of the false variants. A candidate gene—based strategy dra—
matically reduced the total number of genes to be considered from
1149 to 42, whereas a ‘Double—hit’ibased strategy filtered out
another 32 genes that have only one novel variant
(Supplementary Table S3). After removing variants with deleteri—
ous score below 0.8, only eight variants and five genes were left.
Among them, ILIORA was eventually proved to be the disease—
causing gene through a combination of genetics and functional
characterization (Mao et al., 2012). The success of PriVar in defin—
ing causal mutation in this example indicates that it could pro—
vide signiﬁcant help to biologists in prioritizing SNV and indel
calls in a systematic way to reduce search space for further ana—
lysis and experimental verification. Of course it should be cau—
tioned that a causal mutation may be missed from the original
variant calls because of various reasons. More effort is needed
to incorporate more biological and population genetics informa—
tion into variant analysis to help with causal mutation
identification.

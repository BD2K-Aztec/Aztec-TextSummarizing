ABSTRACT

Motivation: p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation plays an
important role in resistance to chemotherapeutic cytotoxic drugs in
treating multiple myeloma (MM). However, how the p38 mitogen-
activated protein kinase signaling pathway is involved in drug resist-
ance, in particular the roles that the various p38 isoforms play, remains
largely unknown.

Method: To explore the underlying mechanisms, we developed a
novel systems biology approach by integrating liquid chromatog-
raphy—mass spectrometry and reverse phase protein array data from
human MM cell lines with computational pathway models in which the
unknown parameters were inferred using a proposed novel algorithm
called modularized factor graph.

Results: New mechanisms predicted by our models suggest that com-
bined activation of various p38 isoforms may result in drug resistance in
MM via regulating the related pathways including extracellular signal-
regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and NFKB pathway. ERK pathway
regulating cell growth is synergistically regulated by p388 isoform,
whereas nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB) pathway regulating cell apop-
tosis is synergistically regulated by p38a isoform. This finding that p388
isoform promotes the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in MM cells treated
with bortezomib was validated by western blotting. Based on the pre-
dicted mechanisms, we further screened drug combinations in silico
and found that a promising drug combination targeting ERK1/2 and
NFKB might reduce the effects of drug resistance in MM cells. This
study provides a framework of a systems biology approach to studying
drug resistance and drug combination selection.

1 INTRODUCTION

Multiple myeloma (MM), as the second most common hemato-
logic malignancy with ~15 ,000 new cases per year in the USA,
remains incurable with a median survival of 4e7 years Wounes
et al., 2007). The relapse of this disease and resistance to treat-
ment cannot be avoided, while recent advances in novel thera-
peutics keep producing promising clinical responses (Hideshima
et al., 2007).

The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signal-
ing pathway is known to play a key role in many cellular re-
sponses, including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, induction of
expression of cytokine genes and cellular differentiation
(Marderosian et al., 2006). More recently, p38 MAPK has
been shown to have a central role in resistance to chemothera-
peutic agents (Guo et al., 2008; Hideshima et al., 2003). To date,
four isoforms of the p38 MAPK family have been identified:
p38a, p380, p38y and p388. Activation of various p38 isoforms
may determine cell fate after drug treatment. Previous research
has shown that the activation of particular p38 isoforms can be
speciﬁcally controlled through different upstream regulators and
co-activated by various combinations of such regulators (Enslen
et al., 1998). Enhanced cell death resulting from p38 MAPK
inhibition when cells are treated with arsenic trioxide (ATO)
and/0r bortezomib (BZM) is thought to be due to the suppres-
sion of c-Jun N—termjnal kinase (JNK) activation by p38 MAPK
(Wen et al., 2010). In MM cells, increased killing by dexametha—
sone and BZM as a result of p38 MAPK inhibition was asso-
ciated with reduced phosphorylation and activation of the anti-
apoptotic protein heat shock protein 27 (Hideshima et al., 2004).
In addition, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 has been shown
to suppress the function of P—glycoprotein in drug-resistant cell
lines leading to the increased efﬁcacy of cytotoxic drugs
(Barancik et al., 2001). Together, these studies suggest that p38
MAPK activation may mediate drug resistance via multiple
mechanisms. However, how the p38 MAPK signaling pathway

is involved in drug resistance, in particular the roles that the
various p38 isoforms play, remains largely unknown.

To discover the mechanism that p38 MAPK activation may
induce drug resistance, we undertook a combined proteomic ana-
lysis and mathematical modeling approach to analyzing the sig-
naling pathways in which p38 MAPK is involved. First, a
quantitative comparison of the global protein expression level
profile differences existing between the individual p38 MAPK
MM cell lines was accomplished by a proteomic analysis ap-
proach called liquid chromatographyimass spectrometry
(LC-MS) (Silva et al., 2006). This resulted in a detailed quanti-
tative analysis of the parental cell line and a quantitative com-
parison of this parental protein expression proﬁle against each of
the individual p38 isoform knockdown MM cell lines for all the
proteins isolated from the MM cell lysates. Second, we per-
formed reverse phase protein array (RPPA) (Peng et al., 2012)
analysis on the MM cell lines with phospho-speciﬁc antibodies to
a selected set of signaling proteins that could be present in the
various p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Combining the results
from these direct experimental proteomic analyses with subse-
quent pathway analysis, our methodology led to the generation
of a set of presumptive protein networks that are probably
altered by differential expressions of various p38 isoforms.

Although both LC-MS and RPPA proteomic technologies
have their respective strengths and weaknesses, the combined
use of both allows us to get a more accurate picture of how
molecular pathways are affected by the individual p38 isoform
knockdown in MM cell lines. However, even though both of
these proteomic technologies have recently been used effect-
ively in many cancer studies, it is still extremely challenging to
extrapolate temporal experimental proteomic data to the dy-
namic conditions inherent to cancer cell physiology and re-
sponse to chemotherapy. Given the complexity of such cell
signaling networks and their diverse responses to their
extracellular environment (Manning and Cantley, 2007),
modeling such response has proven to be difﬁcult.
Therefore, we developed a novel modeling approach to attack
this problem.

It is common to use ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to
model the dynamics of signaling networks and generate a test-
able hypothesis. Obtaining parameters in ODE models is rather
challenging. One way is to search these parameters from the lit-
erature (Peng et al., 2011). The other way is to minimize the error
between quantitative values from model and observations from
biological experiments (Peng et al., 2012). The parameters often
vary in different experimental conditions, so it is not good to
directly use the values of those parameters reported in the litera-
ture. Therefore, it is important to estimate the parameters in each
study. In our study, we developed a novel algorithm called
modularized factor graph (MFG) for the parameter estimation.

Furthermore, we also investigated the optimization of drug
combinations for improving targetable therapies. Currently,
although combinatorial drug intervention has already become
a common therapeutic strategy for complex diseases such as
cancer (Calzolari et al., 2008), it is time-consuming to screen
the promising combinatorial candidates from a great number
of drugs and select the available combinations experimentally.
Hence, many algorithms were developed to direct the experi-
ments, such as drug feature-related combination prediction

et al., 2009), genetic algorithm (GA) (Zinner et al., 2009) and
floating forward selection (Calzolari et al., 2008). However, all of
these methods did not consider the drug effects on comprehen-
sive signaling pathways. Thus, we proposed to use the signaling
pathways to search the potential combinations for combinatorial
drug intervention after establishing the ODE system from experi-
mental data. In general, this study integrates the mass action
modeling of the signaling pathway, screens all drug combinations
in this model and determines the promising drug combination to
reduce the effects of drug resistance.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Summary of the computational approach

Figure 1A shows the workﬂow of the systematic procedure to dis-
cover the mechanism of drug resistance for MM cells and to explore
the effects of drug combination selections. The detail is illustrated as
follows.

In Step 1, to study which pathways are signiﬁcantly altered in MM
cells after knockdown of p38 isoforms, we ﬁrst identiﬁed the proteins
signiﬁcantly altered in their expression pattern among ﬁve conditions
(knockdown of four individual p38 isoforms relative to the non-knock-
down/control condition) in 2D LC-MS experimental data. Then we se-
lected the enriched signaling pathways from the canonical pathway
database of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) based on the differentially
and signiﬁcantly expressed proteins. The generic signaling pathway
(Fig. 1B) was obtained by merging the enriched signaling pathways to-
gether. In Step 2, we ﬁrst reﬁned the generic signaling pathway with
speciﬁc rules. Then we modeled the reﬁned signaling pathways
(Fig. 1C) using ODEs and developed a novel algorithm called MFG to
estimate the parameters in the ODE system by ﬁtting RPPA data to our

model. In this algorithm, we ﬁrst decomposed the signaling pathway into
smaller components and estimated the parameters in each component as
initial values (or initial ranges of the parameters) of the system. The
model was then trained systematically using the algorithm of belief
propagation (BP) on factor graph (Kschischang et al., 2001; Nam
et al., 2011), and a set of smaller parameter ranges was obtained. Then
the parameters were reﬁned through the smaller parameter ranges using
the algorithm of particle swarm optimization (PSO) (Iadevaia et al., 2010;
Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995). In Step 3, we analyzed the parameters
obtained from the previous step and discovered some new mechanisms
and explored the novel drug combinations that reduce the drug resist-
ance. Finally, we validated our model’s predictions of altered MM sig-
naling interactions and responses to various drug combinations via
western blotting.

2.2 Experimental procedures

2.2.] Cell cultures and reagents Human MM cell line Roswell Park
Memorial Institute (RPMI) 8226 was purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) and cultured as previously
described (Wen et al., 2011). IKB kinase (IKK) inhibitor Bay 11-7082
(BIOMOL Research Labs, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) and
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD 184352 (Enzo
Life Sciences, Exeter, UK) were prepared according to manufacturer’s
manuals. ATO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and BZM
(Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA) were prepared as
previously described (Wen et al., 2010).

2.2.2 p38 isoforms knockdown Short hairpin RNA recombinant
vectors to knock down p38or, p38/5, p38y and p388 were constructed
using BLOCK-iTTM Pol II miR RNAi Expression Vector Kits and
BLOCK-iTTM Lentiviral Pol II miR RNAi Expression System accord-
ing to manufacturer’s manual (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After
transduction with high-titer lentivirus in RPMI 8226 cells and following
blasticidin selection, the knockdown efﬁciency was monitored by western
blotting. For each isoform, 4e8 vectors were constructed, and, ﬁnally, the
one with the highest knockdown efficiency was chosen for further
experiments.

2.2.3 Liquid chromatographrmass spectrometry RPMI 8226 cells
with individual p38 isoform (p38or, p38/5, p38y and p388) knockdown
cells and control (RPMI 8226 cells stably transfected with empty
vector) cells were obtained as described above, and then LC-MS experi-
ments were performed for all these cell lines by using well-established LC-
MS methodology (Silva et al., 2006; Zinner et al., 2009) following
enhanced up-front separation of tryptic peptides derived from the cell
line proteomes by 2D RP/RP-nano LC (Gilar et al., 2005).

2.2.4 Reverse phase protein array RPMI 8226 cells with individual
p38 isoform knockdown cells and control cells were cultured in 96-well
plate and treated with ATO (1 pm) or BZM (10 nm) or their combination.
Samples with 0, 5, 10, 30, 60 or 90 min of treatment were collected for
RPPA performed at the RPPA Core Facility of MD Anderson Cancer
Center (Houston, TX, USA) as previously described (Peng et al., 2012).

2.2.5 Cell growth assay RPMI 8226 cells with individual p38 isoform
knockdown cells and control cells were cultured in 96-well plate and
treated with ATO (1 pm) or BZM (10 nm) or vehicle (no-drug). The
cell growth after 24, 48 or 72h of treatment was then assessed by using
the 3-[4,5-dimethy1thiazol-2-y1]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA) as previously
described (Wen et al., 2008). All samples were assayed in triplicate.

2.2.6 Cell apoptosis assay RPMI 8226 cells were cultured and trea-
ted with MEK1/2 inhibitor PD 184352 (1 pm) or IKK inhibitor Bay 11-

7082 (2.5 pm) or BZM (10 nm) or their combinations. The cell apoptosis
after 24h of treatment was then assessed by using the Annexin V assay
(BD Pharmingen) as previously described (Wen et al., 2008). All samples
were assayed in triplicate.

2.2.7 Western blotting RPMI 8226 cells with p388 knockdown cells
and control cells were cultured and treated with BZM (10 nm). Whole cell
lysates were prepared, and lysate proteins were size fractionated by SDS-
PAGE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then electroblotted onto
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes. The blots were probed with the
following antibodies: anti-phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK1/2) and anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA,
USA).

3 RESULTS

3.1 LC-MS dataset analysis

A quantitative LC-MS approach to characterize the MM prote-
ome was initially undertaken to proﬁle the global proteome dif-
ferences observed in MM cell lines following knockdown of each
of the individual p38 isoforms relative to the parental MM
phenotype.

Using the microRNA methodology as described in Section 2,
we ﬁrst established four different RPMI 8226 MM cell sublines
with stably silenced expression of p38a, p38/3, p38y and p388,
respectively, as well as an RPMI 8226 MM cell subline stably
transfected with empty vector as the negative control. Then we
performed the LC-MS experiments for all cell lines, as described
in Section 2. The LC—MS data were then processed, normalized
and compared across the various cell lines using IdentityE and
ExpressionE proteome analysis algorithms in Protein Lynx
Global Server v2.4 software (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). For
the purpose of protein identification, data-independent analysis
(MSE) was performed against the Uniprot human database
(release 2010_08; comprising 20 280 protein entries) with a min-
imum criterion of three high scoring (confidence interval >95%)
peptide matches per unique protein identiﬁcation, and a data-
base search false discovery rate of <1% using both a reversed
and randomized Uniprot human database as the decoy target
database. Using this approach, we were able to unambiguously
identify and quantify 1744 unique proteins (from 36 254 unique
peptides) across the MM cell lines, from which 310 were identi-
ﬁed as statistically signiﬁcant alterations (with P—value < 0.05) in
their expression level patterns relative to the parental control
cell line across all of the individual p38 isoform knockdown
conditions. To simplify the discussion, we denoted a, )3, y and
8 knockdown conditions as knockdown conditions 1, 2, 3 and 4,
respectively. Then for each detected protein, we calculated a rela-
tive ratio deﬁned by p = xij/xi, where xi]- and x,- represent the
relative abundance of protein i from knockdown condition j and
control condition, respectively. Such an analysis resulted in
,0> 1.2 or p<0.83 that were ﬁnally used to get the upregulated
or downregulated proteins, respectively. The results from the
LC—MS dataset analysis are provided in Supplementary
Material S1.

3.2 Constructing the generic signaling pathway

In Mitsos’s paper (Mitsos et al., 2009), the generic signaling
pathway was built in the neighborhood of 5 stimuli and 13

measurements and then created from canonical pathways found
in IPA with subsequently manual curation. In addition,
Iadevaia’s paper (Iadevaia et al., 2010) obtained the generic sig-
naling pathway involving ~23 proteins related to pathways sti-
mulated by the ligand insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-l) in the
MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell line without giving the detailed
criteria. However, in our article, we present a new strategy to get
the generic signaling pathway.

We first picked out four significantly changed protein sets
(shown in Supplementary Material S1) corresponding to the
four conditions that were then fed into IPA to ﬁnd out the im-
portant pathways related to each condition. The selected path-
ways were ranked by P—value [the P—value associated with a
biological process is a measure of its statistical signiﬁcance
with respect to the pathways eligible molecules for the dataset,
which are the overlapped proteins between our selected proteins
and proteins in the pathway candidate and a reference set of
molecules (molecules in the pathway candidates). The P—value
was calculated with the right-tailed Fisher’s exact test]. Then
we obtained 54 pathways with P—values of <0.05 and selected
20 pathways as the most important pathways according to the
literature about MM (Mitsiades et al., 2002; Podar et al., 2001).
The total 54 pathways and the selected 20 pathways are provided
in Supplementary Material S2.

These selected 20 pathways include the phosphatidylinositol-3-
kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/
mTOR) pathway, MAPK/ERK pathway and vascular endothe-
lial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. The descriptions of the
pathways are provided in Supplementary Material S3. Because
these 20 pathways share a lot of proteins with others, we ﬁnally
merged these pathways together through shared proteins and
obtained the generic signaling pathway (Fig. IE).

3.3 Reﬁning the generic signaling pathway

Limited to the inadequate experimental data, it is almost impos-
sible to optimize the parameters of the generic signaling pathway
described by ODEs. Hence, we reﬁned the generic signaling path-
way by the following rules. First, the reﬁned signaling pathway
keeps those pathways closely related with p38 MAPK protein,
including the PI3K/AKT pathway, nuclear factor kappa B
(NFKB) pathway and ERK pathway. The p38 is the most im-
portant protein in this study because our focus herein is to ex-
plore the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance in MM
closely related with p38 (especially the p38 isoforms). Second,
we compressed the cascades in which a series of proteins impinge
on one protein to that central protein. This rule will help keep the
structure of the signaling pathway and largely simplify the com-
plexity of the signaling pathway, and this rule was originally
proposed in the literature (Saez—Rodriguez et al., 2009). Third,
we retained the pathways containing P70S6 kinase (P70S6K) and
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), as these two genes regu-
late the cell growth and cell apoptosis, which are two important
phenotypes for studying the effects of drugs in our speciﬁc study.

3.4 RPPA data

The purpose of this article is to study drug resistance using
RPPA data. Because we have only 153 proteins in RPPA chips
and some important proteins may be missed in RPPA chips

because of no antibodies of those proteins in the current
market, we ﬁrst used LC—MS to determine the generic signaling
pathway related to MM, and then RPPA was used to explore
new mechanisms in the MM cell line based on the aforemen-
tioned refined generic signaling pathway and to determine the
promising drug combination at the end.

Using microRNAs methodology, as described in Section 2, we
first established four different RPMI 8226 MM cell sublines with
stably silenced expression of p38a, p38/3, p38y and p388, respect-
ively, as well as an RPMI 8226 MM cell subline stably trans-
fected with empty vector as the negative control. Then we treated
all cell lines with ATO (1 pm) or BZM (10 nm) or their combin-
ation with the time course: 0, 5, 10, 30, 60 and 90 min and per-
formed the RPPA experiments for total 80 samples (only five
samples needed for the initial time point), as described in
Section 2. Finally, we got dynamic concentration data of total
153 proteins in RPPA chips including phosphorylation levels of
16 proteins in our pathway, as shown in Figure 1C.
Supplementary Material S4 provides the heat map and clustering
result for the whole dataset, as well as an example of the infor-
mation ﬂow of the dataset used in our pathway modeling study.

3.5 Modeling the pathway

According to the description of the pathway shown in Figure 1C,
we can build the whole ODEs system using the law of mass
action. Generally, there are total 40 ODEs and 53 parameters
in the model. In addition, we have RPPA data on 16 proteins
with ﬁve time points for each to be used to train our model for
each condition of total 15 conditions. Using the law of mass
action equations to describe signaling pathway has been widely
used in the previous research (Chen et al., 2009; Iadevaia et al.,
2010). Here we take the reaction of phosphorylated AKT
(pAKT) as an example to explain how to build the ODEs by
modeling the dynamic of concentration of pAKT. Figure 1C
shows that three proteins, i.e. an active guanosine tripho-
sphate-bound form of Ras (Ras GTP), phosphorylated PI3K
(pPI3K) and phoshorylated PDKl (pPDKl), can activate
AKT, which means that there are three producing terms in the
model. Here is the ODE to describe this reaction:

AK
# : kAKTipPDKl >I<  *  ‘I’ kAKTLpPI3K
* [AKH * [pPI3K] + kAKT_RarGTP

>l<  >l< [RasGTP] — kpAKT * 

where [Name] denotes the concentration of protein ‘Name’;
kAKT_pPDKls kAKT_pPI3K and kAKT_RasGTP demon? the phosphoryl-
ation rates of AKT activated by pPDKl, pPI3K and Ras-GTP,
respectively; kpAKT denotes the dephosphorylation rate of pAKT.
The ﬁrst three terms in positive form on the right side of the
equation describe three producing terms, and the last term in
negative form describes consuming term. The detailed equations
of the whole signaling pathway are provided in Supplementary
Material S5.

ment contain relevant information about the regulatory loops

and cross-talks comprising the signaling pathway. In this article,
we developed a new algorithm to fit the model to the time course
data of 16 proteins and infer 53 unknown parameters for each
condition. The new algorithm is described as follows.

3.6.] Parameter estimation Along with development of biology
science, signaling pathways and their models are becoming more
and more important and complicated. For example, Chen’s
model (Chen et al., 2009) consisted of 499 ODEs, which tracked
the dynamics of 828 reactions and 229 parameters. It is impos-
sible to optimize so many parameters in such a large signaling
pathway by classical gradient algorithms or evolution algorithms
such as GA. For this reason, our novel optimization algorithm
decomposed the large signaling pathway into small components
and estimated the parameters in each component. And then, we

Most works on pathway model decomposition focus on iden-
tiﬁcation of small functional subnetworks or network motifs
using structural features of the signaling pathways (Rahat
et al., 2009; Shoval and Alon, 2010). However, our decompos-
ition approach considers the forms of the phosphorylation reac-
tions that drive the flow of bimolecular signals. Our approach is
brieﬂy summarized in the following steps (Fig. 2A). First, we
constructed the mathematical model of the signaling pathway
by mass action equations (see previous section of ‘modeling the
pathway’ for detail) and meanwhile represented the signaling
pathway using hybrid functional Petri net (HFPN) (Tang and
Wang, 2012). Second, guided by some heuristic rules, HFPN was
decomposed into small components (Fig. 2BrC) in which the
parameters can be efﬁciently estimated. Third, we estimated
the parameters of each component via PSO algorithm
(Iadevaia et al., 2010; Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995). Fourth,
we decomposed the signaling pathway into subpathways and
then used factor graph (Kschischang et al., 2001; Nam et al.,
2011) to represent the subpathways. Fifth, we reconciled the par-
ameters of different subpathways via BP algorithm (Kschischang
et al., 2001; Nam et al., 2011) based on the results from the third
step as the initial values and get the best set of parameter ranges.
Finally, the ultimate parameters of the whole signaling pathway
were obtained using PSO algorithm from the ranges of these
parameters obtained from the ﬁfth step.

From aforementioned procedures, there are three levels
(Fig. 2A) in our algorithm: initialization, MFG and reﬁnement.
In the first level, PS0 is used to estimate the parameters in each
component. Because the number of parameters in each compo-
nent is rather small, we can get the results effectively and
efﬁciently. However, the results are obtained component by com-
ponent, so it is necessary to estimate the parameters systematic-
ally. In the second level, we construct factor graph of signaling
pathway and apply BP algorithm to estimate the parameters
systematically and get the best set of parameter ranges. In the
last level, we refine the parameters within the best set of param-
eter ranges using PSO algorithm. We describe more details about
the procedures as follows:

(1) Hybrid Functional Petri Net: An HFPN is a directed bi-
partite graph consisting of two types of nodes: places and
transitions (Fig. 2B). In our case, places and transitions
represent proteins and reactions, respectively, and they are
connected by arcs to indicate the ﬂow of reactants (input)
and products (output). Finally, HFPN and ODE system
can represent the signaling pathway map equivalently. The
details are provided in Supplementary Material S6.

(2) Pathway Decomposition: Guided by specific rules, we
obtained the decomposed signaling pathway shown in
Figure 2C, where there are 16 components marked by
numbers 1716. The detailed rules of decomposition are
provided in Supplementary Material S7.

(3) Parameter Estimation of Components: Parameter estima-
tion can be formulated as an optimization problem with
ODE constrains with the values of state variables at

the selected discrete time points as the output of the
system. We denote the time-series measurements of protein
concentration levels as fop(tJ-) and the theoretical
results obtained from ODEs model as xfl’”(tj, O), where i
is the index of protein, tj is the time point and O is the
parameter vector, which can be obtained by the following
formula:

@* = argmin Z wr(x‘;lm(lja ®) _ xlxp (tj))2
e -:l j:

where a),- = 1 / (max xfxp(tj))2, M and N denote the number
of proteins and the number of time points in the compo-
nent, respectively. The PS0 algorithm was used to opti-

mize the aforementioned problem.

To guarantee the stability of our algorithm, we repeated
the PS0 algorithms 10 times to get the best result for each
component. To improve the efﬁciency of computation, we
used the following strategy to estimate the parameters
component by component. In principle, calculating the
parameters in Component i needs the estimated param-
eters in Component 1 to Component i— 1 because there
could be one or a few more proteins in the previous com-
ponents linked to the proteins in current component. This
step is a local optimization.

Constructing Factor Graph of Signaling Pathway: After
local optimization (estimating parameters component by
component), we were to do global optimization. In the
beginning, we decomposed the pathway into two subpath-
ways (Fig. 2D and E). Each has about half of proteins in
the whole pathway. This decomposition method can
reduce the complexity of computation and improve
performance of optimization by reducing the dimension
of search space. The decomposition method includes the
following steps.

First, we labeled the protein nodes connecting with one of
the phenotypes using different Arabic numbers. The
phenotypes defined here are the outputs of the signaling
pathway, i.e. cell growth and cell apoptosis. Second, the
upstream proteins activating or inhibiting the protein
labeled with Arabic number i were also marked with
Arabic number i. In that way, we tagged all proteins in
the whole pathway with different Arabic numbers and
then defined the pathway as one subpathway in which
the proteins were tagged by the same number. Third, if
two sub-pathways share 90% proteins, we merged these
two sub-pathways together as one sub-pathway. Fourth, if
one sub-pathway has twice as many proteins as in other
sub-pathways, we further decomposed this big sub-path-
way by repeating the aforementioned three steps.

Figure 2D and E shows the results of decomposition. In
principle, we can estimate the parameters in each sub-path-
way using PSO. However, conﬂict exists for some param-
eters related to the shared proteins in Components 174
(Fig. 2C) if we estimate these parameters from different
sub-pathways. BP algorithm is regarded as an approach to

reconcile this kind of conﬂict and presented as messages
updating equations on factor graph. Hence, we need to
represent our signaling pathway as factor graph. A
factor graph is an undirected bipartite graph consisting
of factor nodes and variable nodes. In our present setting,
the signaling pathway is represented as Petri net composed
of places, transitions and arcs (Fig. 2B). We transformed
the Petri net to factor graph by substituting places with
factor nodes, substituting transitions with variable nodes
and reserving all arcs. Figure 2F and G shows an example
of constructing factor graph. As we can see, when one
protein is shared by two different sub-pathways, we set
two factor nodes for this protein. Finally, we constructed
the factor graph for our signaling pathway, which com-
bined together two factor graphs corresponding to two
sub-pathways decomposed above.

Reconciling the Parameters via BP Algorithm: To reconcile
the conﬂicts among the parameters of the shared species,
we ﬁrst deﬁned individual compatibility function for each
factor node in the context of individual factor graph and
then combined all the compatibility functions across two
factor graphs (or the combined factor graph) in one ob-
jective function through which the shared parameters
can be optimized by applying BP algorithm (see
Supplementary Material S8 for details). Note that the ini-
tial values (or the initial ranges) of the parameters used in
BP algorithm were obtained from the step of initialization
of our MFG algorithm. Finally, the best set of ranges of
the model parameters with smaller lengths of intervals can
be obtained through BP algorithm from the initial ranges
with larger lengths of intervals.

v

Refining the Estimated Parameters: Through aforemen-
tioned steps, we obtained the best set of ranges of the
parameters. Finally, the ultimate estimates of the param-
eters were obtained using PSO algorithm from those
ranges. This step was repeated 10 times to get the best
result by improving the stability of our algorithm.

3.6.2 Implementation of the MFG system To make the pro-
posed MFG algorithm clearer, we provide an example model
in Supplementary Material S9 (along with performance evalu-
ation and theoretic exploration), and we further make all the
related source codes and the RPPA experimental data publicly
available (http: / /ctsb .is.wfubmc.edu/ publications /modularized-
factor-graph.php). For MM pathway model, we used the con-
centration levels of proteins at 0min as the control to normalize
the protein proﬁles, i.e. the normalized protein proﬁle at any
time t is the ratio of the raw protein proﬁle at time t over the
one at time 0. That means the initial values of phosphoproteins
in our ODEs systems are all set as 1.

First, from the RPPA data, we got the timescale of producing
reactions and consuming reactions and then roughly calculated
the original ranges of all parameters as [IO—7, 103] via response
time of reactions. When we picked up 1000 sets of parameters
randomly from this range, the values of Pearson’s correlations
between simulation results and experimental data were nearly
zero (data not shown). Second, we went through the level of

initialization of our MFG algorithm to get the initial estimates of
the parameters and then used them to narrow the original ranges
of the parameters to the ranges with all the lengths of intervals as
only 1 and with the centers at the initial estimates. Note that the
corresponding new range was set as [0, 1] if the initial estimate of
a certain parameter was <05. When we picked out 1000 sets of
parameters randomly from those ranges, the values of Pearson’s
correlation for the phosphorylated proteins were improved but
still generally low, and some were roughly located between 0.5
and 0.6 except for phosphorylated Shc (data are provided in
Supplementary Material S10). Finally, they were signiﬁcantly
improved after running the level of MFG, for the Pearson’s cor-
relations for many proteins have been between 0.8 and 0.93
(Supplementary Material S10). Therefore, these results suggest
that the proposed MFG approach is efﬁcient in training big
ODE systems given the initial parameter range setting.

For each condition, we estimated the parameters using the
aforementioned algorithm, and the 42—thread parallel computa-
tion took ~8h on the high-performance computational server
(Dell PowerEdge R815, AMD OperonTM 6172, 2.1GHz, 64
GB Memory, Linux 2.6.32, Debian 2632-31). The ﬁtting results
are provided in Supplementary Material S11. These results again
show that the proposed MFG works well in modeling complex
signaling pathways with limited phosphoproteomics informa-
tion. In addition, we performed the parameter identiﬁability
and sensitivity analysis for all the ﬁnal ODE models in all con-
ditions (see Supplementary Material S12 for details). The results
show that ~80% parameters are identiﬁable in the models and
the models are considerably stable as well.

3.7 Drug resistance shown by experimental results

To assess whether each p38 isoform has distinctive function in
mediating drug resistance, we performed MTT cell growth assay,
as described in Section 2. Figure 3 shows the effects of the drugs
on the growth of p38 isoform knockdown MM cells. Results
show that, in vehicle condition, p388 knockdown cells

MM cells. (A—E) The cell growth proﬁles in different culture conditions

compared with initial time point. Data are mean :I: SD of three independ-
ent experiments. The results show the strong drug resistance in condition
of p388 knockdown cell line treated with BZM

proliferated to ~2-folds after 48 h and ~3.5-folds after 72 h com-
pared with starting point. In contrast, the control and p38a/ 13/ y
knockdown cells proliferated to &7-folds after 72 h. Both ATO
and BZM can inhibit cell growth in all cases. However, these cell
lines showed different resistance to ATO and BZM. For ex-
ample, 72h ATO treatment inhibited 80% of cell growth in
p38a knockdown cells but only 60% in p388 knockdown cells
compared with vehicle. Also, 72 h BZM treatment inhibited 60%
of cell growth in p38ot knockdown cells but only 15% in p388
knockdown cells compared with vehicle. These results manifested
that the functions of p38 isoforms are not redundant, at least not
always. The p380: knockdown cells are more sensitive to ATO or
BZM treatment, which is consistent with our previously reported
ﬁnding that SB203580, a speciﬁc inhibitor to p38a/ﬂ, can syn-
ergistically enhance ATO-induced or ATO/BZM combination-
induced cytotoxicity in MM cells (Wen et al., 2008). To our
surprise, p388 knockdown cells exhibited distinct outcome after
ATO/BZM treatment, which has not been reported to our know-
ledge. The p388 knock down kept MM cells in a more inactive
status in a non-drug condition and conferred MM cells’ higher
resistance to ATO and BZM.

3.8 Identifying new mechanisms and experimental
validation

To determine the mechanisms of drug resistance in MM trig-
gered by p38 isoforms using proposed MFG approach, we
trained the pathway models separately based on RPPA data
from three different MM cell lines, i.e. control cell line, p38a
knockdown cell line and p388 knockdown cell line, all treated
with BZM. Figure 4A illustrates the result of an important part
of the estimated parameters of models in three conditions con-
sidered, from which some new mechanisms related to drug

resistance may be predicted. First, Figure 4A interestingly shows
that four parameters are rather small (<1076) for all three con-
ditions, which are related to four reactions including p_mTOR
phosphorylating P70S6K, pJNK activating BAX, p _p38 activat-
ing BAX and p_c-Jun activating PARP. In our models, the par-
ameter values mean speciﬁc reaction rates in signaling pathway.
When a parameter is rather small, we regard the corresponding
reaction may not exist in the signaling pathway. From the results
of parameter estimation, therefore, the four reactions identiﬁed
above may not exist in the signaling pathway, which are illu-
strated as dash lines with crosses in Figure 4B. Secondly,
Figure 4A shows that the reaction rate of p38 phosphorylating
ERKl /2 in p388 knockdown condition is much smaller than that
in both control condition and p380: knockdown condition, which
predicts that p388 isoform may synergistically promote the phos-
phorylation of ERK1/2. This result is illustrated as brown
bold line (p38 to ERK1/2) in Figure 4B and was validated by
western blotting in Figure 4C. In addition, Figure 4A shows that
the reaction rate of pAKT phosphorylating IKK in p380: knock-
down condition is much smaller than that in both control con-
dition and p388 knockdown condition, which predicts that p38a
isoform may synergistically promote the phosphorylation of
IKK by pAKT. This result is illustrated as green bold line
(AKT to IKK) in Figure 4B. Finally, from the illustration of
Figure 4B we summarize that p38 isoforms result in drug resist-
ance in MM via regulating the related pathways including ERK
pathway and NFKB pathway. ERK pathway regulating cell
growth is synergistically regulated by p388 isoform, whereas
NFKB pathway regulating cell apoptosis is synergistically regu-
lated by p380: isoform.

3.9 Screening drug combinations

To find out the optimal drug treatment to BZM-resistant MM
cells, we screened drug treatments in silico based on our con-
structed pathway model in condition of MM control cell line
treated with BZM, as shown in Figure 4B. In the procedure of
simulation, if we want to simulate the inhibition of a certain
protein by a certain drug, we let the corresponding reaction
rates related to this protein equal to 10‘6 (a rather small
number) for the purpose of simplification; on the other hand,
the effects of drug treatment, i.e. cell growth and cell apoptosis,
were simulated by the concentration levels of two protein marks
p_P70S6K and cPARP, respectively. Then, we ﬁrst screened one
drug treatments throughout all the proteins in the pathway
except for GFR. The simulation results showed that it was
unable to significantly inhibit cell growth and promote cell apop-
tosis simultaneously to reach good therapeutic effect (data not
shown). Next, we screened two-drug combinations and ﬁnally
found out the promising drug combination, i.e. ERKl/2 and
NFKB, which is illustrated using red (bold) hammerheads in
the pathway in Figure 5A. Figure 5B shows the simulation
result of the promising drug combination treatment effects,
which demonstrates that the predicted treatment enhances cell
apoptosis and inhibits cell growth simultaneously and signiﬁ-
cantly. Finally, the prediction of drug combinations from com-
putational screening was partially validated from cell apoptosis
analysis. As shown in Figure 5C, after 24 h treatment, MEK1/2

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, the generic signaling pathway was first built from
LC—MS data. Then we developed a novel computational proced-
ure involving the mass action modeling with a new optimization
algorithm called MFG to train the models against the experi-
mental data (RPPA) and estimate the unknown parameters in
the models. The trained models were then used to analyze the
new mechanisms triggered by different p38 isoforms in the MM
cell lines treated with ATO or BZM. The new mechanisms were
partially validated via western blotting. Based on the predicted
results, we then screened drug combinations and found the pro-
mising drug combination to reduce the effects of drug resistance.

We compared the proposed MGF algorithm with pure PS0
and GA. The computational cost of pure PS0 was huge and the
accuracy was not good. The classical GA was inefﬁcient com-
pared with MFG because the dimensions of searching space were
big. However, in MFG, the level of initialization was used to
decrease the dimensions of searching spacing, and the level of
MFG was designed to optimize the objective function systemat-
ically based on the smaller searching space. Accordingly, the
consuming time was less and it cost ~8 h to estimate 53 param-
eters in ODE model, whereas it took almost 5 days to get the
results using GA or PS0. However, there is still room to further
improve the efﬁciency of MFG algorithm. First, we could
replace PS0 in the refinement level of MFG algorithm with gra-
dient algorithm such as LevenbergiMarquardt or Gaussiani
Newton because convergent speed of gradient algorithm is
faster than heuristic optimization algorithm such as PS0 and
GA when it searches the optimal solutions locally (Marquardt,
1963). Second, the optimization process guided by PS0 in the
step of parameter estimation of components cost almost half of
the whole running time. Therefore, more efﬁcient optimization

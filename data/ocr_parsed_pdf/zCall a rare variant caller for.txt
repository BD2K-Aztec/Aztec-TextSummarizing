ABSTRACT

Summary: zCall is a variant caller specifically designed for calling rare
single-nucleotide polymorphisms from array-based technology. This
caller is implemented as a post-processing step after a default calling
algorithm has been applied. The algorithm uses the intensity profile of
the common allele homozygote cluster to define the location of the
other two genotype clusters. We demonstrate improved detection of
rare alleles when applying zCall to samples that have both Illumina
Infinium HumanExome BeadChip and exome sequencing data
available.

1 INTRODUCTION

Array-based genotyping has been a cost-effective method to cap-
ture common variation in the population and has led to the dis-
covery of genetic risk factors for a wide variety of diseases
(V isscher et al., 2012). In most instances, the signiﬁcantly asso-
ciated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is not known to be
causal but rather likely tags the causal variants through linkage
disequilibrium. In contrast, the mapping of Mendelian diseases
has been successful at identifying not only the gene of interest but
also the speciﬁc variant or variants that are likely causal. Most of
the causal alleles for Mendelian diseases have been found in the
coding region of the human genome (i.e. the exome) (Botstein
and Risch, 2003). With recent developments in sequencing, the
human genetics community has aggregated an extensive list of
coding region variants for the purposes of designing array-based

genotyping platforms that capture these variants (e.g. the
Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip and the Affymetrix
Axiom Exome Array Plate). The overwhelming majority of
variation assayed on the exome chip has a minor allele
frequency <l%.

Existing genotype callers were primarily designed for com-
mon variation (Korn et al., 2008; Ritchie et al., 2011). For
rare variation, however, only the common allele homozygote
cluster is well populated limiting the efficacy of clustering algo-
rithms. To address this need, we developed a new method to
accurately call rare variation for array-based genotyping called
zCall.

2 METHODS

Array-based genotyping works by using two measures of intensity to
separate points into clusters that correspond to a given genotype.
Figure 1 shows a hypothetical cluster plot for a biallelic locus where
there are three clusters labeled as AA, AB and BB. The three clusters
can be separated by a vertical (x: x) and horizontal (y = y) line where
tx and ty are deﬁned from the mean and variance of the homozygote
clusters (AA and BB) and scaled by a z-score threshold, 2.
Subsequently, genotypes are assigned to points based on their position
with respect to [X and ty.

For rare variants, we can directly calculate the threshold for the
common allele homozygote based on the genotypes from a default
caller such as GenCall (Illumina Inc., 2005). We then estimate the rare
allele homozygote threshold through a linear regression model that re-
lates the means and standard deviations of the X and Y intensities
mxAA~ux,BB; axAA~aX,BB) using common sites (minor allele fre-
quency >S%) where the clustering algorithms have been successful. To
ﬁnd the best z-score threshold, common sites are recalled using various
values of z to ﬁnd the best overall concordance.

The zCall algorithm is implemented as follows. Run a default
genotype caller to obtain calls at all sites. Next, use linear regression
to determine the relationship between the means and standard devi-
ations of the X and Y intensities for common sites. Third, using
those same common sites, ﬁnd the optimal value of 2. Finally, at

Fig. 1. Example genotype intensity plot. Schematic of how zCall assigns
genotypes to points based on the normalized intensity distribution of
the homozygote clusters. In normalized intensity space, the common
allele homozygote clusters lie along the x and y axes (circles and
pluses) and the heterozygote cluster lies along the line y=x (circled
pluses). The three genotype clusters can be separated by a vertical
(x: tX) and horizontal line ()1: ty) that are derived by solving for the
location of 2 standard deviations from the mean in the direction of
the minor axis of the cluster. After [X and [Y have been deﬁned, points
are assigned genotypes based on their position relative to the thresholds.
Points in Quadrant I are classiﬁed as homozygotes (BB), points in
Quadrant II are classified as heterozygotes (AB), points in Quadrant
III are classiﬁed as No Calls, and points in Quadrant IV are classiﬁed
as homozygotes (AA)

each site recall genotypes using 2 and the linear regression to cal-
culate [X and ty. Only missing genotypes should be recalled based
on subsequent analysis.

3 RESULTS

We genotyped 9380 samples from a prior Swedish schizophre-
nia association study (Bergen et al., 2012) and 90 HapMap
samples on the Illumina Infinium HumanExome BeadChip.
As described in the Supplementary Methods, we used
Illumina’s GenCall algorithm to generate two sets of genotype
calls and Illumina’s GenomeStudio software to normalize raw
intensities.

First, we used linear regression (R Development Core Team,
2010) to find the relationship between the means and standard
deviations of the X and Y intensities from 10538 autosomal,
common sites using 4643 samples with genotype calls from a
9479 sample cluster ﬁle and found they were correlated
(Rf,=0.069, 12320027, P<2x 10-16) (Supplementary Table
S1). Next, we found that 2:7 performed well to classify
common variation (Supplementary Table S2). Finally, new geno-
types were assigned based on thresholds calculated from the
linear regression model with z: 7 and means and standard de-
viations calculated from 947 samples with GenCall genotype
calls from a 90-sample cluster file.

To test how well zCall works for rare variation, we compared
both GenCall and zCall exome chip genotype calls to
whole-exome sequencing genotypes in 947 Swedish samples
(Supplementary Methods). To assess rare variant performance,
we used the SNP-wise concordance (SWC), which is calculated
by dividing passing sites by the total number of sites. A SNP is
considered passing when the only error is a common

homozygote being called a No Call. For example, when consider-
ing singletons (i.e. one heterozygote), the heterozygote is called
correctly as a heterozygote and no common homozygotes
are called as heterozygotes. For 10075 autosomal, singleton
sites, the SWC between GenCall and whole-exome sequencing
was 92.49% and 96.84%, respectively, for zCall. The main
error mode of GenCall was calling the singleton heterozygote
as a No Call (6.61%) while the main error mode of zCall is
calling common allele homozygotes as heterozygotes (2.32%).
By restricting zCall to missing genotype calls, we observed a
SWC improvement to 99.12% (Supplementary Fig. S1).

We also tried using genotype calls from a larger cluster
file (9479 samples), but the performance of zCall was slightly
worse. Even though more singletons were called correctly
when using a larger cluster ﬁle (SWC=94.65% versus
92.49%), more genotype errors were made that cannot be re-
covered when only calling No Calls (SWC=98.60% versus
99.12%). Therefore, zCall performs more effectively using a
smaller cluster ﬁle.

We also assessed the effect of sample size on threshold deﬁn-
ition. We used three sample sizes for threshold deﬁnition: 90,
947 and 9479. We found that 90 samples were insufﬁcient to
deﬁne the thresholds (SWC=98.86%), but that there was no
difference in SWC between 947 samples and 9479 samples
(99.12% for both).

To provide an unbiased evaluation, we compared GenCall and
zCall genotype calls to whole-exome sequencing data from 369
samples from the ARRA Autism Sequencing Consortium. For
10712 singletons, we found the SWC using GenCall to be
93.12% and using zCall restricted to No Calls to be 99.27%
(Supplementary Fig. S2). We also compared our method with
optiCall (Shah et al., 2012) and found for 10 705 singletons, the
SWC of optiCall was 98.21% versus 99.27% for zCall
(Supplementary Fig. S3).

4 CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated that zCall improves the performance of
GenCall to detect singletons by ~7% in two different datasets.
By restricting to recalling missing genotypes, we minimize the
number of errors introduced while increasing the sensitivity of
the default caller for rare variation. Additionally, zCall allows for
parallel calling once the thresholds have been deﬁned. Overall,
we demonstrate improved ability to capture rare variation over
existing methods.

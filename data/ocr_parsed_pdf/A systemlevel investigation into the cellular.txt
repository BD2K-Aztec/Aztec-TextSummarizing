ABSTRACT

Motivation: Viewing a cellular system as a collection of interacting
parts can lead to new insights into the complex cellular behavior.
In this study, we have investigated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)
signal transduction pathway from such a system-level perspective.
AhR detects various xenobiotics, such as drugs or endocrine
disruptors (e.g. dioxin), and mediates transcriptional regulation of
target genes such as those in the cytochrome P450 (CYP450)
family. On binding with 2,3,7,8—tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD),
however, AhR becomes abnormally activated and conveys toxic
effects on cells. Despite many related studies on the TCDD-mediated
toxicity, quantitative system-level understanding of how TCDD-
mediated toxicity generates various toxic responses is still lacking.

Results: Here, we present a manually curated TCDD-mediated AhR
signaling pathway including crosstalks with the hypoxia pathway that
copes with oxygen deficiency and the p53 pathway that induces
a DNA damage response. Based on the integrated pathway, we
have constructed a mathematical model and validated it through
quantitative experiments. Using the mathematical model, we have
investigated: (i) TCDD dose-dependent effects on AhR target genes;
(ii) the crosstalk effect between AhR and hypoxia signals; and
(iii) p53 inhibition effect of TCDD-liganded AhR. Our results show
that cellular intake of TCDD induces AhR signaling pathway to
be abnormally up-regulated and thereby interrupts other signaling
pathways. Interruption of hypoxia and p53 pathways, in turn, can
incur various hazardous effects on cells. Taken together, our study
provides a system-level understanding of how AhR signal mediates
various TCDD-induced toxicities under the presence of hypoxia
and/or DNA damage in cells.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cells are composed of well-organized molecular interaction
networks. To understand the response mechanism of a cell against
an external stimulation, we should not only identify the mediating
signal transduction pathways but also investigate the dynamics
accompanied with the signal transmission. This can be readily
achieved using high-throughput techniques such as microarray
experiments, but previous studies indicated the problem of low
reproducibility in such cases (Zhang et (11., 2008). SO, We
construct a mathematical model for computer simulations by
employing low-throughput techniques and investigate the dynamics
of cell signaling at a system-level by combined analysis of
computer simulations and biochemical experimentation. Based
on the collection of biological or biochemical information about
signaling pathways induced by a speciﬁc stimulation, we can
construct the relevant molecular interaction network and further
investigate the dynamics of the molecules involved in the network
(Kim et al., 2007, 2009; Kwon and ChO, 2008; Shin et al., 2008,
2009). This might lead us to a system-level understanding of the
complex phenomena. Here, we applied the idea to the AhR signaling
pathway to unravel the complicated signaling pathway disruption by
external stimulations.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a member of the basic helix—
loop—helix/Period—aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT)—
Single minded (bHLH/PAS) DNA binding protein family. Although
AhR is located in the cytosol bound to a molecular complex
composed of HSP90, XAP2 and p23, upon binding with a
ligand such as TCDD, it is translocated to the nucleus and
becomes heterodimerized with ARNT after dissociated from the
HSP90/XAP2/p23 complex. This liganded AhR/ARNT dimer binds
to consensus regulatory sequences of DNA, called ‘dioxin response
elements’ or ‘xenobiotic response elements’ and transcribes the
associated genes.

2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a speciﬁc type of
polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, also known as dioxin, which is one
group of the most toxic materials including dioxin-like chemicals
known so far, such as polychlorinated dibenzofurans and biphenyls.
TCDD is used as a toxic standard evaluating the toxic equivalency
factor (TEF) value of dioxins and dioxin-like chemicals to indicate
the degree of toxicity. TCDD is top ranked with TEF = 1, which is the
highest value among the tested chemicals (Van den Berg et (11., 1998,

2006). TCDD is a toxic standard for dioxin-like chemicals because a
number of evidences have been reported about its various hazardous
effects on human body: liver and skin damages (Kimbrough et al.,
1977), diabetes (Longnecker and Michalek, 2000), thyroid (Pavuk
et al., 2003), etc. Recent studies also revealed that TCDD could be
a potential carcinogen (Safe, 2001).

Although various toxic effects of TCDD have been studied for
several decades, its detailed molecular mechanisms are still poorly
understood except the TCDD-mediated transcriptional regulation of
AhR and its binding with ARNT. TCDD gets bio-accumulated in
fatty tissue of human due to its hydrophobicity with wide individual
variation of half-life ~7—10 years (Geyer et al., 2002; Pirkle et al.,
1989). Accumulated in fatty tissue, TCDD sustains AhR activation
and causes the transcription of target genes such as CYP1A1
(Cytochrome P450, family 1, subfamily A, polypeptide 1) andAhRR
(AhR repressor gene) (Mimura and Fujii-Kuriyama, 2003). In many
cases, the TCDD toxicity is strongly related to the accumulation of
CYP1A1. Although there have been a number of studies to discover
the downstream mechanism followed by this abnormal accumulation
of CYP1A1, it is still unclear how the downstream signals ﬂow and
what affects the cellular toxicity.

Conventional studies on toxic materials usually focus on a
single particular aspect among various observed toxicities or
phenomenological responses, called ‘dose—response relationship’ in
which the dose denotes the amount of a toxic substance and the
response usually indicates the lethal rate of an organism. However,
complex polygenic disease like cancer and diverse effects of toxic
materials on living organisms need a broader systems approach.

Several recent studies revealed that AhR may crosstalk with
other signaling pathways so that liganded AhR could affect other
biological functions (Gradin et al., 1996; Paajarvi et al., 2005).
In particular, we note two previous studies reporting that TCDD-
liganded AhR inactivates p53 by increasing the basal level of MDM2
protein, not its mRNA, which is a well-known E3 ubiquitin ligase
(Paaj arvi et al., 2005) and ARNT, the counterpart of AhR, binds with
hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIFlOL), a well-known hypoxia
responding protein (Gradin et (11., 1996; Pollenz et al., 1999).
ARNT is one of the bHLH/PAS transcription factor families. ARNT
transcribes various genes after binding with HIFlOL (or AhR) to
cope with toxic perturbations such as hypoxia (or dioxin intake).
This suggests the possibility that ARNT might play a limiting
role in the competing signal transmission between AhR and HIFs
(Reisdorph and Lindahl, 2001). These results indicate that TCDD
might have some positive effect on carcinogenesis by disturbing
the DNA damage response signaling pathways and the role of p53,
and negative effect by competing with HIFlOL that transcribes genes
related to angiogenesis under hypoxia. Hence, there is a pressing
need to do a system-level study on these such that we can unravel
the molecular mechanism of various toxic responses produced by
the TCDD-mediated AhR signaling pathway.

2 BACKGROUND

TCDD intake is related to the regulation of P53, a well-known tumor
suppressor gene and an important element in anti-cancer mechanism.
In normal cells, the basal level of p53 protein is low due to the
regulation by its ubiquitin ligase, MDM2. If DNA damage occurs
(DNA damage frequently occurs in cells because of ultraviolet ray,
reactive oxygen species, etc.), MDM2 becomes inactive and thereby

p53 gets accumulated. Then, a set of genes are transcribed that are
related to cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis, to cope with
the damage (Harris and Levine, 2005). It is intriguing that MDM2 is
also transcribed by p53 and that this forms the p53-MDM2 negative
feedback loop.

The dynamics of the p53-MDM2 feedback loop in individual cells
has been intensively investigated in several studies (Geva-Zatorsky
et al., 2006; Lahav et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2007). In particular,
Alon and his colleagues discovered that p53 shows an increased
number of repeated pulse expressions in response to the DNA
damage (Geva-Zatorsky et al., 2006; Lahav et al., 2004). Based on
these studies, Zhang et al. (2007) proposed a mathematical model by
assuming that p53 goes through conformational changes depending
on its particular transcriptional activity: p53-killer transcribes genes
related to apoptosis and p53-helper transcribes genes related to cell-
cycle arrest or DNA repair. In this model, a transient form between
p53-helper and p53-killer is also assumed and denoted as p53-lurker
(Zhang et al., 2007).

3 MATERIALS AND METHODS

3.1 Model construction

We have surveyed KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) database as well as
all the relevant literature to construct a manually curated AhR signaling
pathway. Using all possible combinations of ‘AhR’, ‘TCDD’, ‘hypoxia’,
‘p53’ and ‘crosstalk’ as queries, we found the most relevant 107 articles and
used them to construct a reaction diagram that is largely composed of three
different modules (AhR, hypoxia and p53 module; Fig. 1). Then, we have
constructed a mathematical model of it using ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) based on the mass action law for protein interactions (Cho et al.,
2003) and the saturating rate law for transcriptional reactions in the reaction
diagram. For instance, for a given protein interactions

the rate constants for forward and backward reactions, respectively.

3.2 Parameter estimation

For simulations, parameter values were adopted from literature if they are
available, and all the remaining parameter values were estimated from our
own experiments using the genetic algorithm (GA):

RNA was extracted using RNA STAT6O (Tel-test, Friendswood, TX,
USA) from cells treated with indicated concentrations of TCDD for
indicated periods and subjected to complementary DNA synthesis using
AccuPowerCycleScript RT Premix (Bioneer, Daejon, Korea). The real-time
RTiPCR was performed with mixtures containing synthesized cDNA, 1><
SYBR premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa Bio Inc, Shiga, Japan), 0.5>< ROX and
primers using Mx3000P quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR)
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). GAPDH was used as an internal control
in each procedure. The thermal cycling was one cycle at 95°C for
2min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C at 10s and 60°C for 30s. After
amplifying reaction, melting curve analysis was performed from 55°C to
95°C(A0.5°C/s). Relative quantiﬁcation was analyzed by the AACt method
(Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). The sequences of primers against CYP1A1,
GAPDH and VEGFOL were as follows:

3.6 Immunoblot analysis

Proteins extracted from TCDD-treated cells were subjected to 10% SDS7
PAGE. Separated proteins were electrically transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes were soaked in 5% non-fat dried
milk for 30min and then incubated with primary antibodies for overnight
at 4°C. After being washed, membranes were incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature. An hour
later, membranes were washed in tris-tween buffered saline (TTBS) and
proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham,
Buckinghamshire, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 A system-level reconstruction of the
TCDD-mediated AhR signaling pathway

To have a system-level understanding of AhR signaling, we
have collected all the relevant molecular interaction information
from both database and literature by manual curation, and then
reconstructed the whole signaling network diagram based on the
collected information (see Section 3 for details). We reconstructed
the AhR signaling pathway by including hypoxia and p53 pathways
(Fig. 1). Then, we developed a mathematical model of this integrated
system using ODEs (see Section 3).

To obtain the experimental data for parameter estimation, we
used three different concentrations of TCDD dose input (0.1, 1
and 10 nM) to HepG2 cells and measured the expression levels
of the downstream target genes (CYP1A1 and AhRR) and the AhR
localization patterns (Supplementary Fig. S1) at eight different time
points over 52 h using immunoblot analysis. We also measured the
expressions of the target genes (VEGF and EGLN) of HIF10L under
hypoxia stimulation. All the kinetic parameters in our mathematical

model were tuned to ﬁt the experimental data (Fig. 2). We veriﬁed
that the dose (TCDD)—response (AhR complex*n) curve predicted
from our model is well in accord with the previous experimental
report (Chen and Bunce, 2003) (Supplementary Fig. S2). Based on
this, we further simulated the proﬁles of some key molecules under
various conditions (Supplementary Figs S3—5) and investigated the
crosstalk between TCDD and hypoxia pathways.

4.2 Crosstalk between the TCDD and hypoxia
pathways

In the foregoing section, we noted that both AhR and HIF10L
commonly bind to ARNT and that this competitive binding can
lead to crosstalk between them. To investigate the crosstalk effect in
detail and to see how hypoxia affects the TCDD-induced signaling
pathway, we have simulated AhR*/ARNT (* denotes TCDD-
1iganded) heterodimer concentration proﬁle and its transcriptional
activity through CYP1A1 mRNA level under various hypoxia
stimulations.

Without hypoxia (also called, ‘normoxia’), both AhR*/ARNT
and CYP1A1 increase rapidly and arrive at high steady-state levels
under all different TCDD treatments (blue lines in Fig. 3), whereas
they arrive at lower steady-state levels under a hypoxia condition.
Moreover, we found that the decrease was slow and the steady-state
level difference was small under a low hypoxia condition (green
dashed lines in Fig. 3), whereas the decrease was fast and the steady-
state level difference was large under a high hypoxia condition (red
dot-dashed lines in Fig. 3).

We have also investigated the inverse relationship, i.e. the
crosstalk effect of TCDD on HIF10L target gene expression (VEGF
and EGLN induced by hypoxia). Without any stimulation, no
transcription was induced (blue line for VEGF and red line for EGLN
in the left panels of Fig. 4). With hypoxia stimulation, HIF10L protein
was activated and the expressions of its target genes, VEGF and
EGLN, were rapidly induced (middle panels in Fig. 4). Although
HIF10L has strong effects on AhR localization and its target gene
transcription via the limiting factor, ARNT, the crosstalk partner

Fig. 4. Computer simulations of the HIF10L target gene expression under
different conditions of hypoxia and 10 nM TCDD stimulation. Target genes
of HIF10L, VEGF and EGLN, are transcribed only if hypoxia happens (middle
panel in both rows). TCDD does not show any inhibitory effect on the
transcription of HIF10L target genes that are induced by hypoxia (compare
middle and right panels).

AhR has no signiﬁcant effect on HIF10L target gene expression (right
panels in Fig. 4). We have further investigated the dose—response
characteristics by comparing the baseline (no crosstalk) model, the
hypoxia crosstalk model, and the ARNT over-expression model
(Supplementary Fig. S6). The hypoxia crosstalk model showed
a similar dose—response characteristic with the baseline model,
whereas the TCDD—CYP1A1 dose—response curve was shifted to
left when ARNT is over-expressed (note that the dose—response
curves were normalized with the maximum response levels for
comparison of activation thresholds). This implies that the ARNT
level rather than the hypoxia condition is more crucial in determining
the dose—response characteristic of TCDD and CYP1A1.

We have further validated our simulation results by conducting
experiments on target gene expressions. In particular, to conﬁrm
the simulation results on the crosstalk between HIF10L and AhR,
we have probed the expression proﬁles of CYP1A1 and VEGF.

Fig. 5. Validation of the crosstalk between hypoxia and TCDD by comparing
target gene expressions. After HepG2 cells were treated with TCDD (10 nM)
under normoxic/hypoxic condition for 24 h, CYP1A1 and VEGF-1 mRNAs
that are the target genes of AhR and HIF10L, respectively, were measured.
One of the AhR target gene, CYP1A1, highly induced by TCDD was inhibited
dramatically with hypoxic stimulation (A). HIF10L target gene, VEGF-1
induced by hypoxia was not repressed by TCDD (B).

normoxic and hypoxic conditions for 24 h, total RNA extraction
and CDNA synthesis were carried out (see Section 3 for details).
To measure the levels of CYP1A1 and VEGF-I mRNAs, real-time
quantitative RT—PCR was performed using synthesized CDNA. The
relative quantity was then calculated using the AACt method with
GAPDH mRNA as an internal control. As in the simulation results,
CYP1A1 mRNA was sensitively up-regulated with TCDD input.
With both hypoxia and TCDD treatment, the regulation of CYP1A1
was, however, completely inhibited (Fig. 5A). VEGF, one of the
well-known target genes induced by hypoxia stimulation, was also
tested. VEGF was highly induced by hypoxia, distinct from TCDD
input and control experiments. However, when both inputs were
taken, unlike CYP1A1, VEGF was seldom inhibited (Fig. 5B).

The crosstalk between TCDD and hypoxia seems to be from
the competition between their downstream signaling proteins, AhR
and HIFloi, for binding with their co-partner, ARNT. The most
interesting point is that TCDD did not affect the hypoxia pathway
although the expression of CYP1A1, the target gene of AhR/ARNT,
was strongly inhibited by hypoxia. This is different from many other
well-known crosstalks in which signals are usually inhibited by each
other. It might be because of either the binding aﬁnity difference of
AhR and HIFloi with respect to ARNT or the limited concentration
of ARNT that actually forms this ‘one-way’ crosstalk. The stronger
binding afﬁnity to ARNT the protein has, the easier it is to win
the competition and to remain forming a heterodimer with limited
concentration of ARNT. In addition, we found that any increase or
decrease of the total amount of ARNT from the basal level of our
model (40 AU.) can weaken this crosstalk effect (Supplementary
Fig. S7). This implies that the crosstalk effect can be easily repressed
by changing the protein level of ARNT.

Cells usually undergo transcriptional changes to maintain
homeostasis against external stimuli. For instance, under hypoxia,
cells lack dissolved oxygen and need to transcribe genes related
to angiogenesis such as VEGF so as to supply sufﬁcient oxygen.
Therefore, HIFlOL, the transcription factor of VEGE is activated and
the VEGF gene is transcribed. Under TCDD stimulus, cells turn
on the AhR signaling pathway in order to respond to this stimulus
by transcribing CYP1A1, which oxidizes a variety of compounds
including steroids, fatty acid and xenobiotics (TCDD), and this
response mechanism ﬁnally helps to digest out the compounds. On
the other hand, if multiple stimuli are applied simultaneously, then

the situation becomes more complicated. In this case, a competition
arises between the signaling proteins (HIFloi and AhR) and the
shared protein (ARNT) is likely to bind more dominantly with the
stronger signaling protein (HIFlOL).

4.3 TCDD attenuates the p53 response

We have incorporated our AhR signaling pathway model with the
p53 model of Zhang et al. (2008) based on the fact that TCDD input
affects p53-related signals (i.e. when a TCDD treatment is given,
the basal level of MDM2 abnormally increases and this makes the
p53 level attenuated (Paajarvi et al., 2005)). We have investigated
how TCDD input affects the p53 concentration under DNA damage
using both simulations and experiments.

Figure 6 shows the maximum level changes of activated p53 with
respect to various levels of TCDD concentration and DNA damage.
This simulation result indicates that the p53 level becomes less
sensitive to DNA damage if the concentration of TCDD increases.
It also shows that p53 mostly remains at a basal level regardless
of the TCDD concentration for low DNA damage, whereas the
p53 response becomes attenuated along with the increase of TCDD
concentration for high DNA damage. In particular, we note that the
slightly induced p53 decreases to its basal level in the medium range
(100‘4—100‘6 A.U.) of DNA damage due to the crosstalk between
AhR and p53 signaling pathways.

The inhibitory effect of TCDD on the p53 activity is
experimentally veriﬁed as follows. After HepG2 cells were
incubated in the absence or presence of TCDD for 24 h, they
were further treated with DOX for indicated times. Then, total cell
lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis against
phospho-p53 (see Section 3 for details). Immunoblot analysis
against GAPDH was done for equal protein loading. While without
treating DOX, no phospho-p53 was observed, treating DOX showed
the induction of phospho-p53 with either absence or presence of
TCDD in cells. Under the presence of TCDD in cells, however,
phospho-p53 was less observed than the case with TCDD (Fig. 7).

When DNA damage occurs, p53 is activated and transcribes its
target genes for cell-cycle arrest, damage repairs, and apoptosis.

Fig. 7. TCDD inhibitiory effects on p53 phosphorylation under DNA

TCDD and they were further treated with DOX during the indicated period
of time. Then, phospho-p53 (Ser-15) was measured.

As previously reported by Paajarvi et al. (2005), we also found
that AhR, liganded by TCDD, inhibits the p53 activity from
both experiments and computer simulations. In the case of p53
inhibition by TCDD-liganded AhR, p53 cannot properly supervise
the transcriptional reactions against DNA damage and this causes
a failure in recovering from the damage. This malfunctioning
of p53 plus bare excretion of TCDD might eventually lead to
TCDD-mediated carcinogenesis. In other words, TCDD weakens
the functional activity of p53 as a killer to the damaged cells.
Although the p53 activity is signiﬁcantly inhibited by TCDD-
liganded AhR, we found that the apoptosis rates are similar in both
TCDD-treated and non-treated cases (Supplementary Fig. S8). We
further performed computer simulations to investigate the change
of hypothetical p53 ‘killer form’ under various conditions such as
all possible combination of TCDD treatment and DNA damage
(see Supplementary Fig. S9). In summary, we found that the total
concentration of apoptotic gene-transcribing p53 (p53 killer form)
with TCDD treatment is similar to that without TCDD treatment
under both mild and severe DNA damage although phosphorylated
p53 is inhibited by TCDD treatment (see Supplementary Fig. S10).

5 CONCLUSION

To our knowledge, no attempt has been made to understand
the complex regulatory mechanism of TCDD-mediated AhR
pathway from an integrated system-level perspective. Only a few
review papers described the overall schematic model of the AhR
signaling pathway without consideration of the crosstalks (Barouki
et al., 2007; Mimura and Fujii-Kuriyama, 2003). So, we have
reconstructed a comprehensive model of the AhR signaling network
through extensive manual curation, and developed a mathematical
model of it using ODEs based on biochemical experiments. Our
combined simulation analysis and experimental validation of the
model showed that AhR localization and its transcriptional activity
are dose-dependent and that they are inﬂuenced by hypoxia
through the crosstalk with HIF10L where ARNT plays a role as
a limiting factor. Interestingly, the hypoxia signaling inhibits the
transcriptional activity of AhR, but the reverse is not true. This might
be originated from the different binding afﬁnities between AhR and
ARNT, and HIFloi and ARNT. We also found that the maximum
level of p53 changes as the levels of DNA damage and the TCDD
intake vary. In particular, for low DNA damage, the p53 level does
not change much along with the TCDD intake and remains at a basal
level. For high DNA damage, TCDD attenuates the p53 response but
the decrease is not enough and the transcription activity of p53 is

not fully inhibited. Interestingly, a weakly induced p53 activity is
completely inhibited by TCDD-intake for a medium level of DNA
damage. Taken together, our combined study provides us with a
system-level understanding of the complicated cellular responses
under various conditions. General limitations or challenges of
our approach include the non-uniqueness problem of parameter
estimates (i.e. the possibility of multiple parameter estimates that ﬁt
the given experimental data in a relatively similar degree) and the
unknown missing component of the model. These can be alleviated
by conducting more experiments or, conversely, these can motivate
biologists to design new experiments.

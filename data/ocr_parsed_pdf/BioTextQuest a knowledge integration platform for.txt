ABSTRACT

Summary: The iterative process of finding relevant information in
biomedical literature and performing bioinformatics analyses might
result in an endless loop for an inexperienced user, considering the
exponential growth of scientific corpora and the plethora of tools
designed to mine PubMed® and related biological databases.
Herein, we describe BioTextQuestT, a web-based interactive know-
ledge exploration platform with significant advances to its predecessor
(BioTextQuest), aiming to bridge processes such as bioentity recog-
nition, functional annotation, document clustering and data integration
towards literature mining and concept discovery. BioTeXtQuest+ en-
ables PubMed and OMIM querying, retrieval of abstracts related to a
targeted request and optimal detection of genes, proteins, molecular
functions, pathways and biological processes within the retrieved
documents. The front-end interface facilitates the browsing of docu-
ment clustering per subject, the analysis of term co-occurrence, the
generation of tag clouds containing highly represented terms per clus-
ter and at-a-glance popup windows with information about relevant
genes and proteins. Moreover, to support experimental research,
BioTextQuest+ addresses integration of its primary functionality with
biological repositories and software tools able to deliver further bio-
informatics services. The Google-like interface extends beyond simple
use by offering a range of advanced parameterization for expert users.
We demonstrate the functionality of BioTeXtQuest+ through several
exemplary research scenarios including author disambiguation, func-
tional term enrichment, knowledge acquisition and concept discovery
linking major human diseases, such as obesity and ageing.

1 INTRODUCTION

The tremendous growth of biomedical literature and biological
data repositories has become a true challenge for researchers who
wish to follow in detail the developments in rapidly growing
ﬁelds (Altman et al., 2008). Currently, PubMed contains >22
million publications and information about biological entities,
such as genes, proteins, pathways and sequences, which is
stored and distributed by several repositories worldwide.
Therefore, targeted information retrieval from literature and
other data collections often becomes a complicated and tedious
task when searching with available engines (Lu, 2011) as it regu-
larly results to hundreds or thousands of records, typically not
sorted by relevance and often changing on parameterization or
query rephrasing.

Despite the plethora of proposed tools aiming to make docu-
ment searching easier, more efﬁcient and targeted, literature
mining is still an open area of research (Rodriguez-Esteban,
2009) Tools designed to tackle this problem can be classiﬁed in
ﬁve categories:  tools for ranking search results, (ii) tools for
document clustering in several topics, (iii) tools for semantic
annotation and display, (iv) tools for predicting relations between
bioentities and/or concepts and (v) tools extending PubMedfunc—
tionality by improving the search interface. Notable tools for
result ranking include Quertle (Giglia, 2011), MedlineRanker
(Fontaine et al., 2009), Caipirini (Soldatos et al., 2012),

MiSearch (States et al., 2009), MScanner (Poulter et al., 2008),
eTBLAST (Errami et al., 2007) and PubFocus (Plikus et al.,
2006). Typically, they use a combination of classiﬁers, such as
support vector machines or weight schemes, complemented by
artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms to rank documents based on
MeSH® terms, author names or structured vocabularies.
Document clustering tools, such as Anne O’Tate (Smalheiser
et al., 2008), McSyBi Wamamoto and Takagi, 2007), PuRed—
MCL (Theodosiou et al., 2008), GoPubMed (Doms and
Schroeder, 2005) and XPlorMed (Perez-Iratxeta et al., 2002),
aim to group documents into subjects for easier management
of large unordered lists of results. Clustering is mostly performed
by the use of MeSH terms, UMLS dictionaries, GO terms, titles,
afﬁliations, keywords, authors, standard vocabularies, extracted
terms or any combination of the aforementioned, including se-
mantic annotation. Other tools, e.g. OnTheFly (Paﬁlis et al.,
2013; Pavlopoulos et al., 2009) for full-text or MedEvi (Kim
et al., 2008), EBIMed (Rebholz—Schuhmann et al., 2007),
BioLit (Fink et al., 2008), BSQA (He et al., 2010) and PubNet
(Douglas et al., 2005), for abstract-based analysis, extract rela-
tions between bioentities, such as proteins, chemicals, drugs, GO
terms, and deliver them as visual network representations.
Additionally, tools such as FACTA+/FACTA (Tsuruoka
et al., 2008, 2011) or PolySearch (Cheng et al., 2008) are designed
to help users browsing and linking biomedical concepts. Finally,
tools like HubMed (Eaton, 2006), askMEDLINE (Fontelo et al.,
2005), PubCrawler (Hokamp and Wolfe, 2004) and iPubMed
(Wang et al., 2010) take advantage of the newest web technolo-
gies to provide enhanced interfaces with various search op-
tions, ﬁltering and parameterization, currently not available in
PubMed.

While most of the aforementioned tools serve complementary
purposes and are PubMed-based, only a few of them manage
to bridge the gap between information retrieval and analysis. The
iterative process, (i) compose the most appropriate query, (ii) query
several databases, (iii) retrieve information, (iv) filter down the
most relevant results, (v) retrieve further information about the
bioentities of interest from other repositories, and (Vi) analyse
the data, can become tedious, demanding and laborious.
Therefore, the development of efﬁcient tools to automate and
bridge such procedures is of major importance. BioTextQuest+
provides a workﬁow to query PubMed and OMIM databases
(Hamosh et al., 2005) and feed an automatic pipeline for docu-
ment preprocessing, clustering, visualization and data integration
with other repositories. It comes with an intuitive web-based
graphical user interface and supports name entity recognition
(NER) in abstracts and depiction of associations among them
within the inferred clusters. In addition, it offers an array of
visualization tools for efficient navigation among biomedical
records and concept extraction/association. Through in—house
services, BioTextQuest+ provides links and further information
from public repositories about the identiﬁed genes/proteins in
one or more clusters. Such information includes homology, tran-
scription factor analysis, protein clustering by domain content,
generation of proteiniprotein/proteinichemical interactions and
functional enrichment. BioTextQuest+ is a complementary tool
to PubMed and offers intuitive solutions for researchers who can
navigate from a single query to concept discovery, knowledge
management and bioinformatics analysis in a simple, controlled

and automated way, thus making BioTextQuest+ a powerful
tool for the scientiﬁc community.

2 METHODS

2.1 System overview

BioTextQuest+ is an easy-to-use web application aiming to support
literature management, knowledge discovery by concept association
and data integration, aimed at both computational and experimental
researchers. It is designed to maximize user experience by offering a
simple Google-like web interface and graphical visualization of associ-
ations among biological terms. The core component of BioTextQuest+ is
based on a number of former implementations (Iliopoulos et al., 2001;
Papanikolaou et al., 2011) aiming to extract signiﬁcant biomedical terms
from an abstract collection and subsequently cluster these abstracts into
subjects according to their similarity based on the extracted terms.
Currently, BioTextQuest+ signiﬁcantly extends its inherited functionality
by supporting queries to both PubMed and OMIM repositories, and
facilitates advanced text annotation services, employed to map the ex-
tracted terms of biomedical signiﬁcance to the corresponding bioentities.
The reported document clusters and their associated terms, along with the
retrieved annotation, are combined to generate a series of views of results.
In addition, BioTextQuest+ incorporates web services to automatically
enable in-depth bioinformatics analysis for the gene and protein set of
each resulting cluster. Importantly, users can interactively sub-cluster
and/or re-cluster the results of any completed analysis. The functionality
of BioTextQuest+ is summarized in Figure 1 and described in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods ﬁle.

2.2 Query system

BioTextQuest+ currently enables both PubMed and OMIM querying
(Supplementary Figure Sl). Both databases are locally stored and
a daemon is implemented to monitor new MEDLINE® and OMIM re-
leases to maintain them up to date weekly. The query field allows input of
any valid PubMed and OMIM query supporting all features offered by
their search mechanisms, such as ﬁeld-tags, Boolean operators or group-
ing parentheses. In the case of PubMed, BioTextQuest+ uses the Entrez
utilities to post a query directly to PubMed and get back the PubMed
identiﬁers of matching entries. In a subsequent step and depending on
user-deﬁned parameters, the platform uses these identiﬁers to retrieve the
appropriate combination of abstracts and their associated MeSH terms
from the local database (Supplementary Figure Sl, Figure 1B), thus
maximizing the speed of information retrieval. In the case of OMIM,
BioTextQuest+ follows a similar strategy. It initially allows the user to
query the OMIM database and get back the corresponding identiﬁers to
the query. The following step is to either query the local OMIM database
for the OMIM text related to these identiﬁers or collect the PubMed
identiﬁers for each OMIM record and subsequently query the local
PubMed for their abstracts and MeSH terms (Figure 1B,
Supplementary Figure Sl). While PubMed retrieval is performed in a
few seconds, OMIM full-text analysis may take a few minutes, as parsing
the original text of the retrieved records is required. BioTextQuest+ users
may also specify the number of documents to be retrieved/processed (with
a maximum of 5000 articles/entries as default). In cases of queries return-
ing >5000 documents, the 5000 most recent are retained for analysis.

2.3 Document similarities

We represent each abstract with a binary vector indicating the presence or
absence of the biologically signiﬁcant terms found in the text collection
(Figure 1D). Similarity metrics available in BioTextQuest+ are the Cosine
similarity, Tanimoto coefficient, Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman
correlation and Kendall’s Tau rank correlation coefficient. Additionally,

we use the Okapi BM25 similarity, which is widely used by search engines
to rank matching documents according to their relevance to a query
(Sparck et al., 2000) and is mostly preferred for large document sets.

2.4 Document clustering

Inspired by jClust (Pavlopoulos et al., 2009) and NeAT (Brohee et al.,
2008) applications along with ClusterMaker (Morris et al., 2011),
we incorporated a plethora of clustering algorithms in BioTextQuest+
to cluster documents based on their signiﬁcant terms. We have currently

integrated the Afﬁnity Propagation (Frey and Dueck, 2007), MCL
(Enright et al., 2002), k-Means (MacQueen, 1967), average linkage hier-
archical clustering from SCPS (Nepusz et al., 2010) and spectral
(Paccanaro et al., 2006) clustering algorithms. Notably, the aforemen-
tioned methods take as input the similarity matrices as deﬁned in the
previous section and their results are visualized in various ways as
shown in Figure 1F. Comparisons between these algorithms are presented
elsewhere (Boyack et al., 2011; Moschopoulos et al., 2011). In order not
to overwhelm non-expert users, we chose to hide by default the relevant
options from the main interface; MCL is selected as the default clustering
algorithm with inﬂation value 1.8 and the cosine similarity metric. Some
may consider that the plethora of the integrated algorithms can become
confusing; however, it is a useful feature for clustering experts, as each
algorithm carries a different philosophy on how to cluster data
(Pavlopoulos et al., 2009). An important feature of BioTextQuest-l- is
that it hosts two classes of clustering algorithms, depending on whether
the number of resulting clusters is required as input. For example, MCL
automatically detects the number of clusters formed by the data (depend-
ing on the choice of inﬂation parameter), whereas k-Means requires that
the number of clusters k is known beforehand. Empirically, the MCL and
k-Means clustering algorithms are among the fastest with MCL being
able to handle bigger datasets due to its stochastic nature and its efﬁcient
memory handling.

2.5 Representation of results

The resulting page provides different views of the results organized under
tabs, along with a frame holding a summary of the analysis. The ‘Tag
Clouds’ view displays a tag-cloud, computed for the terms characterizing
each document cluster (Figure 1F, left). This type of familiar representa-
tion can be particularly informative, as the font size of each term is pro-
portional to the fraction of documents with the speciﬁc term within a
cluster. Additionally, in this view, users may highlight (i) terms appearing
exclusively in any particular cluster (unique), (ii) terms that are not stand-
ard grammatical terms (i.e. they do not belong in the reference dictionary
used by BioTextQuest+), (iii) terms describing protein names, detected
and annotated using the Reﬂect web service and (iv) Gene Ontology-
related terms (i.e. processes/pathways/cellular components) identiﬁed via
the Whatizit web service. When users have opted for applying a stemming
algorithm, terms are displayed in their stemmed form. However, the re-
spective unstemmed terms are revealed for inspection by clicking on the
tag-cloud. The ‘Clustered Documents’ view (Figure 1F, middle) categor-
izes the documents in subjects corresponding to implicit concepts and
provides the titles of the documents that belong to each cluster with a
link to the respective article in PubMed. Finally, the ‘Biomedical Terms’
view (Figure 1F, right) lists the signiﬁcant terms identified by the
BioTextQuest+ algorithm and subsequently used for the clustering pro-
cedure. Each term is graphically annotated and colored in the same
manner as in the ‘Tag Clouds’ view. Users may directly interact with
the results by requesting a new reﬁned analysis of the corpus retrieved
by the current query. This is achieved by any combination of (i) altering
the available tunable options (e.g. stemming or clustering algorithms and
their parameters), (ii) excluding terms from the term list available in the
‘Biomedical Terms’ view and (iii) removing clusters of documents from
the ‘Tag Clouds’ view.

2.6 Co-occurrence analysis

Term co-occurrence analysis is offered when users select up to ﬁve terms
of interest (mouse click). BioTextQuest+ subsequently retrieves the set of
documents where the selected terms are co-mentioned. Users can switch
between an abstract-based and sentence-based co-occurrence analysis,
thus revealing associations between bioentities through their coexistence
in single sentences or entire abstracts (Pavlopoulos et al., 2014).
We currently use simple rules to segment the sentences using periods as

sentence delimiters, i.e. as indicators of sentence termination in English.
When two or more terms are found between two successive delimiters we
consider that they co-occurred in the same sentence. This functionality is
presented in Figure II.

2.7 Gene, protein and chemical information at a glance

Often, resulting pages contain signiﬁcant terms, such as genes and pro-
teins appearing as names, symbols, database identiﬁers or free text. To
automate and maximize information extraction, we highlight these terms
and provide at-a-glance information about their functionality by enrich-
ing BioTextQuest’s+ resulting pages with the Reﬂect annotation service
(Paﬁlis et al., 2009) through J avaScript feeds. In this manner, a researcher
can obtain information about a protein in a popup window on-the-ﬂy
with a single mouse click. This popup window compacts information
about the protein sequence, its 3D structure, related protein interactors,
hosting organisms, subcellular localization, functional domains and sev-
eral identiﬁers and synonyms. An example of such a popup window is
presented in Figure 1G.

2.8 Data integration and functional enrichment

To automate functional enrichment and information retrieval from pub-
lic repositories, we have merged BioTextQuest+ with the in-house high-
throughput experimental data analysis platform, BioCompendium
(http://biocompendium.embl.de) (Figure 1H). BioCompendium is cur-
rently a publicly accessible high-throughput experimental data analysis
platform and is designed to work with large lists of genes or proteins for
which it collects a wide spectrum of biological information from public
repositories. It facilitates the analysis, comparison and enrichment of
experimental results; either proprietary or publicly available datasets
are supported. Notably, the current version is designed to work for
human, mouse and yeast. The main features of the BioCompendium
system are summarized below: (i) Comprehensive knowledge collection
from different biological databases for a given list(s) of genes. (ii) Search
interface to the knowledge collection to find information like gene annota-
tions, disease associations, sequence domain architectures, related chemicals
and involved pathways. (iii) Enrichment analysis for Gene Ontology terms,
diseases, pathways and other biological concepts. (iv) Extraction of proteim
protein (PPI), proteimchemical interactions networks. (v) Protein cluster-
ing data based on sequence similarity-based homology and sequence domain
architectures in a given list(s) of genes. (vi) Automated analysis and clus-
tering of transcription factor binding site profiles. (vii) Gene linking to
orthology information, clinical trial and patent information. (viii) Deep
comparison of results derived from different experimental conditions, time
series or treatments. By using in-house web services, BioTextQuest+ is
able to automatically feed the BioCompendium platform with the rele-
vant identiﬁers for proteins mentioned in a set of selected clusters. The
protein names are ﬁrst translated to ENSEMBL identiﬁers, and a new
analysis with all the features of BioCompendium is offered in a new tab.
Genes belonging to a certain document cluster are mapped to ENSEMBL
identiﬁers through Reﬂect and are fed into BioCompendium. Gene
annotations are collected through ENSEMBL (Flicek et al., 2012),
EMBL (Cochrane et al., 2009), GenBank (Benson et al., 2011),
EntrezGene (Maglott et al., 2011), UniGene (Schuler, 1997), UniProt
(Magrane and Consortium, 2011), IPI (Kersey et al., 2004), NCBI
Protein (Sayers et al., 2012), RefSeq (Sayers et al., 2012), HGNC (Seal
et al., 2011), GeneCards (Safran et al., 2010) and UCSC (Fujita et al.,
2011) databases. Sequence domain architectures, structures and annota-
tions are collected from PDB (Berman et al., 2007), HSSP (Schneider and
Sander, 1996) and PSSH (Schafferhans et al., 2003). Functional enrich-
ment is performed by querying the Gene Ontology repository (Ashburner
et al., 2000) to collect all of the related biological processes, molecular
functions and cellular components. Pathways containing any of the sub-
mitted genes are retrieved from KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2012), and genes

that belong to any cluster are highlighted within the target pathway.
Biological networks (Pavlopoulos et al., 2011) such as PPIs are obtained
from the STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2011) database and proteinwhem-
ical interaction networks are gathered from STITCH (Kuhn et al., 2008).
Relations with other chemicals are additionally retrieved from DrugBank
(Wishart et al., 2008), HMDB (W ishart et al., 2009), PubChem (Bolton
et al., 2008), chEBI (Degtyarenko et al., 2008), MATADOR (Gunther
et al., 2008) and PDBLigand (Feng et al., 2004). Analysis and clustering
of transcription factor binding site proﬁles is performed with the use of
JASPAR (Bryne et al., 2008), and access to orthology information and
clinical trials is given by the ENSEMBL (Vilella et al., 2009) and
ClinicalTrials.gov (Zarin et al., 2011) resources, respectively. Finally,
patent information is collected from the EPO Proteins (www.epo.org),
JPO Proteins (www.jpo.go.jp), USPTO Proteins (www.uspto.gov) and
KIPO Proteins (www.kipo.go.kr/en/) repositories.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Author disambiguation and use of MeSH terms

Searching for an author name in PubMed can often be confusing
and misleading and might result in long unordered lists when
there is a substantial overlap between the names of different au-
thors working in different fields. To demonstrate the usefulness
of the tool in author disambiguation, we query PubMed for
‘Pavlopoulos G[ AU ]’ author. ‘Pavlopoulos GA’ (a co-author of
this article) works in the areas of bioinformatics and computa-
tional biology with emphasis on biological data analysis and
visualization, whereas ‘Pavlopoulos G’ is an ophthalmologist.
Despite the name overlap and the apparent concept similarity
between ‘data visualization’ and ‘human vision/ ophthalmology’,
BioTextQuest+ is able to distinguish the author names with
maximum accuracy. We have chosen the following parameters:
cosine similarity, Markov clustering and, importantly, clustering
based on signiﬁcant terms without the use of MeSH terms for a
less directed and unsupervised clustering. BioTextQuest+ suc-
cessfully detected the two authors in two distinct clusters for
‘Pavlopoulos GA’ (17 articles) and ‘Pavlopoulos G’ (7 articles).
Over-represented significant terms in the tag cloud for the
former author include the words: ‘bioinformatics’, ‘datasets’,
‘visualization’, ‘large—scale’, ‘high-throughput’ and ‘genomics’.
Similarly, over-represented signiﬁcant terms in the second tag
cloud for the latter author include the words: ‘diopter’,
‘keratometry’, ‘corneal, ‘intraocular’ and others. We repeated
the same analysis by additionally using MeSH terms for a
more guided clustering and by triggering the same clustering
parameters. Again, BioTextQuest+ produces two distinct clus-
ters for the two authors. New and more specialized over-repre-
sented terms give a clearer overview about the author’s profile.
Such terms include ‘information retrieval , ‘cluster analysis’, ‘user
interface’, ‘databases’ and ‘computational biology’. Similarly, new
specialized words such as ‘diagnosis’, ‘laser therapy’, ‘eye infec-
tion’, ‘contact lenses’ and ‘conjunctivitis’ clearly refer to the ﬁeld
of ophthalmology, thus providing an enriched picture about the
second author’s proﬁle and background. This example clearly
demonstrates the challenge of author name disambiguation in
possibly semantically overlapping areas of activity and the
drill through steps in term collections. Moreover, this example
illustrates that the use of MeSH terms may highlight subtle con-
cepts characterizing a speciﬁc corpus.

3.2 Functional enrichment

To demonstrate the bridging between text-mining and data inte-
gration and simultaneously benchmark the accuracy of the
BioTextQuest+ service, we have performed a case study based
on an extensive cell cycle dataset (Jensen et al., 2006). According
to this study, 600 human genes were assigned to speciﬁc phases
of the cell cycle, given their expression levels at 100 different time
points (Supplementary Figure S2A). We performed four differ-
ent MeSH-termibased queries (Supplementary Figure S2B) to
the BiotextQuest+ platform and retrieved all recent PubMed
articles which uniquely mention a specific phase of the human
cell cycle by excluding all others (phases M, G1, S, G2) (Soldatos
and Pavlopoulos, 2012). BioTextQuest+ retrieved 2431 articles
for M-phase, 2475 for Gl-phase, 6900 for S-phase and 2218 for
G2—phase (Supplementary Figure S2B). The results were subse-
quently treated as one cluster (k-means, k = I), and genes
with high TF-IDF were automatically annotated by the
BioCompendium service. According to the queries and the
high TF—IDF threshold (>19), 24 genes were assigned to
the ﬁrst query (‘M-phase’[MeSH Term]), 51 to the second
(‘Gl-phase’[MeSH Term]), 25 to the third (‘S-phase’[MeSH
Term]) and 49 to the fourth (‘G2-phase’[MeSH Term]). We
have ﬁltered these gene lists taking into consideration the pro-
posed gene list (Jensen et al., 2006) to detect which of the anno-
tated genes belong to the reference cell cycle dataset. The process
returned 8 genes for M-phase, 7 for Gl-Phase, 8 for S-phase and
11 for G2-phase (Supplementary Figure S2C). To calculate the
coverage of our method, we have highlighted the genes which
correspond to the correct phase in their given time points.
We observed 75% correctly assigned genes for M-phase, 50%
for Gl-phase, 75% for S-phase and 82% for G2—phaseilargely
corresponding to an overall precision of >70%. Similarly, recall
can be calculated at 75, 67, 75 and 64%, respectively, again cor-
responding to a >70% value. While there is no genuine gold
standard dataset to assess true accuracy in this kind of scenario,
as the target categories are not mutually exclusive, we show the
ability of BioTextQuest+ to implement a workﬂow with gen-
omics-like experiments for the discovery of relevant genes and
proteins.

3.3 Knowledge discovery

To assess the power of BioTextQuest+ for knowledge discovery,
we have interrogated PubMed abstracts for the involvement
of nucleophosmin (NPM) in human diseases. NPM (also
known as B23) is a nucleolar protein that participates in a pleth-
ora of cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, response
to genotoxic stress, maintenance of genomic stability and DNA-
repair as well as regulation of chromatin modifications inﬂuen-
cing transcription (Colombo et al., 2011; Grisendi et al., 2006).
Using the query ‘(NPM OR 323) AND disease’ and choosing to
include both abstracts and MeSH terms with the k—Means clus-
tering algorithm (k = 3) on the BioTextQuest+ platform, enables
us to focus on the most prevalent disease-related functions of
NPM, we retrieved 258 abstracts, with 707 signiﬁcant biomedical
terms forming 3 clusters: Cluster 1 is dominated by the terms
‘NPM—ALK’, ‘anaplastic lymphomas’ and ‘translocation’; Cluster
2 is enriched for the terms ‘NPM’, ‘leukemia’ and ‘myeloid’ but
not for the term ‘NPM—ALK’; and Cluster 3 is characterized by

the terms ‘nucleolar’, ‘NPM’, ‘autoantibodies’, ‘autoimmune’ and
‘immunology’. NPM is implicated in human carcinogenesis. In
anaplastic large cell lymphoma, a t(2;5) (p23; q35) translocation
leading to the production of a chimeric protein comprising NPM
fused to the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a frequent
genetic event and the oncogenic role of NPM-ALK has been
established using a variety of experimental models (Grisendi
et al., 2006Frepresented in Cluster 1. The chimera functions
as a constitutively-active protein tyrosine kinase operating in
the cytoplasm to activate proliferation-promoting signaling path-
ways. In acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype, a het-
erozygous mutation in exon 12 of NPM (termed NPMc) results
in the localization of the mutated protein in the cytoplasm,
thereby reducing the tumor-suppressing properties of nuclear
NPM produced by the wild-type alleleirepresented in Cluster
2. The role of NPM in immune responses and autoimmune dis-
eases is less—well studied but clear links between NPM antigens
and susceptibility to a distinct pulmonary vascular phenotype
in scleroderma and graft-versus-host disease have been estab-
lished (Ulanet et al., 2004Frepresented in Cluster 3. With
BioTextQuest+ , the three disease entities have thus been success-
fully distinguished, allowing a rapid and reliable assessment of
the role of NPM in human disease and associations between
NPM structure and pathogenic functions. This example eluci-
dates the ability to blindly and reproducibly detect subtleties
with little prior information provided. One may argue that the
choice of k = 3 is biased and reﬂects some prior knowledge on
what is expected to be ‘discovered’ for this speciﬁc case.
Nevertheless, choosing larger values of the parameter k (e.g.
k = 5) only changes the number of resulting clusters, without
modifying their semantics. In fact, while a few abstracts seem
to cluster within different concepts, such an approach reveals
additional and more ﬁne-grained characteristics of the speciﬁc
corpus (data not shown).

3.4 OMIM-BioCompendium example

The potential of BioTextQuest+ for concept discovery was
validated by the examination of potential links between two
seemingly unrelated human health conditions: aging and obesity.
A PubMed search using these terms resulted in a signiﬁcant
number of 5939 publications, hindering the identiﬁcation of
commonalities in the pathophysiology and/or molecular fea-
tures of these diseases. To overcome this bottleneck, the
BioTextQuest+ suite was used to query the OMIM reference
database for the terms ‘Obesity AND Aging’. A total of 14 docu-
ment clusters representing 1874 research papers were identified.
The largest cluster (Cluster 1) comprising 1095 documents, is
dominated by the terms apolipoprotein, ApoE, allele, polymorph-
isms and Alzheimer’s disease. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a
major constituent of chylomicrons and the most abundant apo-
lipoprotein in the central nervous system. The ApoE s4 allele has
been associated with hypercholesterolemia, a hallmark of obes-
ity, and with increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease, the common-
est cause of dementia in the elderly. Thus, the expression of 84
increases the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease by as much
as 779 years per allele (J arvik et al., 1995). In addition to the 84
haplotype, a promoter polymorphism has been independently
associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk, suggesting that not

only qualitative variability between the various ApoE isoforms
but also quantitative differences in ApoE levels may inﬂuence the
risk of this pathology (Lambert et al., 1998). Genes represented
in Cluster 1 were interrogated for signaling pathway similarities
through the BioTextQuest-l- link to the BioCompendium ser-
vice. Input genes signiﬁcantly (adjusted P—value<1076) mapped
to inﬂammatory and metabolic disease-related signaling cas-
cades, such as Adipocytokine (KEGG ID: hsa04920), NOD-like
receptor (KEGG ID: hsa04621), Toll-like receptor (KEGG ID:
hsa04620) and RIG-I—like (KEGG ID: hsa04622) signaling path-
ways. BioCompendium-based prediction of transcription factors
regulating the input genes revealed common regulators, such as
members of the NF-kB family (RelA, NF—kBl), the peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and the retinoid X
receptors (RXRs). NF-kB transcription factors are powerful
orchestrators of pro-inﬂammatory gene expression and the
PPAR-RXR transcriptional complex plays a critical role in in-
ﬂammation and energy balance, including triglyceride metabol-
ism and glucose homeostasis. Collectively, the aforementioned
BioTextQuest-l- analyses suggest that obesity and aging may
share common pathogenic pathways and raise the possibility
that pharmacological or dietary interventions aiming to control
the inﬂammatory component of these diseases may contribute
to healthy aging. The link between obesity and aging is fur-
ther highlighted by Cluster 12 of this BioTextQuest+ study,
comprising 12 documents which are characterized by the terms
telomere and chromosomal. Indeed, obesity in humans has
been associated with reduced telomere length in women, a mo-
lecular hallmark of aging and associated co-morbidities, such
as dementia and cognitive decline (Martin-Ruiz et al., 2006;
Valdes et al., 2005). This example illustrates the potential of
BioTextQuest-l- for rapid knowledge acquisition and concept
discovery.

4 DISCUSSION

The field of text mining in life and health sciences expands
rapidly, considering the exponential growth of biomedical litera-
ture. While techniques such as NER, information extraction,
co-occurrence analysis have become more mature, the field is
still in its infancy, as most of these approaches have only been
used for PubMed-based abstract-centric searches. Currently, a
limited number of tools succeed in automatically bridging litera-
ture mining, information extraction, integration with external
repositories and implementation of workﬂows for further bio-
informatics analysis. Herein, we present BioTextQuestT, a plat-
form principally developed to bridge the gaps between these
complementary areas. With PubMed and OMIM repositories
as starting points, BioTextQuest+ currently offers automated
literature extraction, identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant bioentity
terms, term-based document clustering, co-occurrence analysis
as well as integration with a rich collection of biological
databases and automated bioinformatics analysis. While initial
versions of this platform focused only on document
clustering (Iliopoulos et al., 2001; Papanikolaou et al., 2011),
BioTextQuest+ adds a signiﬁcant set of novel features
(Supplementary Table S1). A description of the most salient
characteristics of established tools in the ﬁeld are presented
in Supplementary Table S2 and a thorough comparison of

BioTextQuest+ with these tools is summarized in
Supplementary Table S3. We do believe that a gold standard
benchmark dataset or process is largely missing to objectively
measure the performance of any such tool. It is worth stressing
that this is a signiﬁcant challenge, partly because different text
mining tools are built to address different questions. Evidently,
the BioCreAtIvE challenge (Krallinger et al., 2008) or similar
community-driven initiatives may become the proper forum for
designing and implementing such a gold standard benchmark
process. BioTextQuest+ can thus serve as a powerful tool
in the ﬁelds of biomedical literature mining and data integration
by aiding users in concept discovery and new hypothesis gener-
ation, enhancing our arsenal in the efforts to tackle the complex-
ity of biological text.

Abstract

Motivation Can we predict protein—protein interactions (PPls) of a novel virus with its host? Three
major problems arise: the lack of known PPls for that virus to learn from, the cost of learning about
its proteins and the sequence dissimilarity among viral families that makes most methods inapplic—
able or inefficient. We develop DeNovo, a sequence—based negative sampling and machine learn—
ing framework that learns from PPls of different viruses to predict for a novel one, exploiting the
shared host proteins. We tested DeNovo on PPls from different domains to assess generalization.
Results: By solving the challenge of generating less noisy negative interactions, DeNovo achieved
accuracy up to 81 and 86% when predicting PPls of viral proteins that have no and distant sequence
similarity to the ones used for training, receptively. This result is comparable to the best achieved
in single virus—host and intra—species PPI prediction cases. Thus, we can now predict PPls for
virtually any virus infecting human. DeNovo generalizes well; it achieved near optimal accuracy
when tested on bacteria—human interactions.

1 lntrOdUCtlon There are four interleaving components to address for the case of

Predicting protein interactions of a novel virus with its host is a
3-fold data problem. First, few or no protein—protein interactions
(PPIs) may be available for a novel virus to learn from, prohibiting
the application of the typical single virus-host PPI prediction meth-
ods. Second, learning advanced protein features (like structure) for
a novel virus protein can be time-consuming, a challenge to obtain
(Perdigéo et (11., 2015), and a generalization barrier. Third, sequence
dissimilarity among viral families (King et (11., 2012) makes
transferring knowledge from PPIs of some families to another family
insufficient to model its PPIs. Predicting inter-species PPIs (which
involve proteins from two different organisms) imposes additional
difficulty over intra-species PPI prediction.

predicting PPIs of novel viruses with their shared host: PPI samples
to learn from; features to represent the PPIs in a way that allows
generalization; a learning approach that deals with the difficulties
imposed by this type of prediction; and the consequent problem of
generating negative PPI samples to learn from.

Features. Prediction methods need features extracted from PPI ex-
amples to learn. Four major feature extraction approaches are typical
in pathogen-host PPI prediction. Sequence homology-based
approaches (Zhou et (11., 2014), structure-based approaches (Dyer
et (11., 2007; Zhou et (11., 2013b) and domain-based approaches
(Evans et (11., 2009; Sarmady, 2010; Zhou et (11., 2013b) transfer

known interactions from one protein to another based on sequence
homology, structure similarity, or sharing of interaction interfaces,
respectively (Nourani et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2013a). Additionally,
sequence dissimilarities among viral families hamper the generaliza—
tion of these knowledge—based approaches to all novel viruses. The
fourth category extracts features from the amino acid sequences of
the protein pairs. It is successfully used on single virus—host PPI pre—
diction (Cui et al., 2012; Dyer et al., 2011) and adopted in DeNovo.

Learning approaches. Three major learning approaches dominate
inter—species PPI prediction (Nourani et al., 2015): classic machine
learning, where a model learns to discriminate between positive and
negative PPIs (Cui et al., 2012; Dyer et al., 2011; Tastan et al.,
2009); data mining approaches that model true PPIs and measure a
putative PPI similarity to them (Nouretdinov et al., 2012); and
transfer learning, where knowledge of PPIs is selectively transferred
from a rich domain of PPIs to the target one for which prediction is
needed using commonalities between the two domains (Kshirsagar
et al., 2013; Mei, 2013). We anticipate that data mining and transfer
learning approaches are not adequate for novel virus PPI prediction,
mainly because virus families carry no sequence similarities among
themselves sufficient to make data mining or transfer learning from
available PPIs of other viruses possible.

Data problem. In predicting PPIs for a virus with its host, either
there are a sufficient number of known PPIs, few, or none. In the
first case, usually a model is trained on the available PPIs to predict
additional ones (Dyer et al., 2011; Tastan et al., 2009). As most
viruses do not have many known PPIs, these single virus—host predic—
tion approaches are not universally applicable. Recently, transfer
learning is applied to learn from PPIs between a pathogen and its
host and make prediction for another pathogen through a transfer
function that maps knowledge between the domains (Kshirsagar
et al., 2013; Mei, 2013). However, transfer function design can be a
challenge to build between viral families where members share no
sequence similarities and may require prior knowledge of the two
domains.

Negative sampling. A machine learning model needs to learn the dif—
ference between the positive and negative classes, yet there is no
gold standard of non—interacting proteins nor is there enough infor—
mation to build one (Shen et al., 2007). Typically, negative examples
are generated randomly, for other knowledge—based methods are
mostly biased (Ben—Hur and Noble, 2005). Data mining approaches
bypass negative sampling by modeling true interactions. For ex—
ample, conformal prediction is used in a recent study (Nouretdinov
et al., 2012) where the conformance of a putative PPI is evaluated
against the known PPIs and classified as positive if its prediction
confidence is above a predefined threshold.

Solution overview. This study addresses the generalized problem of
predicting PPIs between a virus and its host without the need to
know any of their interactions in advance. The key idea is to learn
interaction features for the host proteins rather than for specific viral
proteins. The model depends only on protein sequences to extract
features and generate unbiased negative examples to ensure general—
ization. Data are partitioned in a way that simulates the situation of
a new virus to reasonably evaluate the performance. We further
make three hypotheses on what attributes potentially guide the
learning process and use our framework to test them to link biolo—
gical and computational aspects of the prediction process. We name

the proposed solution DeNovo as an analogy to de novo protein
structure prediction, for it makes prediction without prior know—
ledge of any interactions between the two organisms to learn from.
See Supplementary Material SS for the solution workflow.

DeNovo demonstrates the feasibility of predicting interactions of
a virus protein with human proteins by learning from the available
interactions of other viruses that also infect human, even with little
or no sequence similarity to the viral proteins in training. The
framework achieves accuracy comparable to the best reported for
intra—species PPI prediction (using sequence information) despite the
challenging nature of the generalized problem. We additionally dem—
onstrate DeNovo generalization to other pathogens.

2 Methods

DeNovo divides the virus—human PPIs data set into training and test—
ing pairs in a way that simulates a novel virus prediction situation.
DeNovo learns only from the amino acid sequence of the interacting
pairs. To overcome the low prediction accuracy when random nega—
tive examples are used in training, a sequence—based negative sam—
pling method is proposed. Its performance is assessed using other
data sets and compared with other methods to demonstrate general—
ization and robustness.

2.1 Data set and preparation

Virus—human PPIs were collected from VirusMentha (accessed
June 2014) (Calderone et al., 2014). Each viral protein is given by
its UniProtKB identifier and NCBI taxon identifiers of its corres—
ponding virus and viral subfamily (Wheeler et al., 2007). The
data set contains 5753 unique interactions between 2357 human
proteins and 453 viral proteins, covering 173 different virus spe—
cies in 25 subfamilies. Sequences of the human and viral proteins
were retrieved from UniProt (UniProt Consortium and Others,
2014).

Interactions were filtered down to 5445 PPIs between 2340
human proteins and 445 viral proteins, covering 172 viral species in
28 subfamilies (Supplementary Material S6). A PPI was eliminated if
one of its proteins has no corresponding reviewed sequence in
UniProt (UniProt Consortium and Others, 2014), if the viral protein
belongs to a virus whose taxon identifier is not annotated as hosted
by human in UniProt, or if the viral protein belongs to a virus that
lies on a branch (on the taxonomy tree) with limited representation
in the data set (a threshold of 10 PPIs was used).

2.2 Problem definitions

Novel virus PPI prediction problem. To the heart of DeNovo is the
usage of virus—host PPIs available for a set of viruses and a shared
host to predict PPIs of the host proteins with another virus that is
foreign to the available virus set. The problem can be formalized as:

Given: a list of viruses v1, v2, . . . ,vn, vn+1 infecting a host 10, a set
of proteins H for b, a set of proteins V for v1,v2, . . . ,vn, a set of
positive interactions between members of H and V, and a set of pro—
teins Vn+1 for vnH;

Find: all likely interactions between members of H and VnH.

Negative sampling problem. We call the process of generating nega—
tive examples from the positive ones ‘negative sampling”. In the con—
text of PPI prediction, a negative interaction (example) resulting
from this process is a pair of proteins unlikely to interact. For the

/310‘srcumo[p10}xo‘sopcuHOJIItotq/ﬁdnq

F.—E.Eid et al.

 

special case of virus—host PPIs between multiple viruses and a shared
host, the negative sampling problem can be defined as:

Given: a set of host proteins H, a set of viral proteins V, and a
list of positive interactions between members of H and V;

Generate: a list of negative (unlikely) interactions between mem—
bers of H and V.

Data partitioning problem. Machine learning applications typically
split the available data into training and testing sets. Here, we use
‘data partitioning” to refer to dividing the data set based on some cri—
terion into multiple subsets, each of which can serve as a testing set
while the remaining subsets are grouped into a corresponding train—
ing set. This problem can be defined in the context of virus—host PPI
prediction as:

Given: a set of host proteins H, a set of viral proteins V, a list of
positive and negative interactions between members of H and V,
and a criterion Cr on sets of interactions;

Find: a partitioning of the interactions into subsets, each of
which satisfies Cr.

2.3 Hypotheses

Hypothesis 1 (features learning). We hypothesize that if we use a
large number of interactions between different viruses and host pro—
teins to train a classification model, it can learn to classify inter—
actions with respect to the host proteins, rather than specific viral
proteins. We anticipate that the classifier will extract features associ—
ated with the host proteins being interacting or not interacting. In
such a case, PPI prediction would be possible for a foreign viral pro—
tein as the model will evaluate whether it is likely or unlikely to
interact with each of the human proteins it was trained on.

Hypothesis 2 (shared interaction partner). We hypothesize that viral
proteins with high sequence similarity can theoretically interact with
a large number of similar host proteins. This hypothesis is based on
two observations. First, viral protein interaction interfaces are likely
to be different and more flexible than those of human proteins
(Tokuriki et al., 2009). Second, their interactions with the host pro—
teins are extensively mediated with viral short linear motifs (SLiMs),
which give them the flexibility to interact with a larger number of
host proteins (Davey et al., 2011). Using negative random sampling
for the virus—host PPIs case will possibly lead to a large number of
false negative examples.

Hypothesis 3 (sequence similarity). We hypothesize that strong
sequence similarity between a tested viral protein and some viral
proteins in the training set enhances the classification decision accur—
acy. Some interaction—related features may be conserved across the
related viral proteins and consequently reflected in their sequences
and the corresponding feature vectors. A novel virus not only has no
known interactions, but it also may have no strong sequence similar—
ities with any viral protein in the training set. We thus anticipate
that the accuracy in the case of predicting PPIs of a novel virus can
be much lower than when there are some related viral proteins in
the training set.

2.4 Dissimilarity—based negative sampling

Random sampling. In the typical random negative sampling method,
for a viral protein x, the set of human proteins that serve as partners
in the negative intersections with x are picked randomly from the set

of all human proteins (in the data set) that x does not interact with.
We expect random sampling to produce many more incorrect nega—
tive examples than expected in the intra—species PPI case (according
to Hypotheses 2 and 3 in Section 2.3), misleading the learning pro—
cess and lowering the prediction sensitivity.

Proposed sampling. Our negative sampling method aims at reducing
the expected large number of false negative examples by the random
sampling. According to our hypotheses, if two viral proteins are
similar in sequence, a human protein that interacts with one of them
cannot be paired with the other as a negative example. The
DISSIMILARITY—RANDOM—SAMPLING algorithm (Supplementary Material
59) calculates all—versus—all global alignment bit—scores of the viral
proteins. Bit—scores are then normalized, and their complements are
used as the dissimilarity distances between the pairs of viral proteins.
After excluding the unlikely negative examples based on a dissimi—
larity threshold T, random sampling is performed over the remain—
ing negative interactions.

Dissimilarity threshold. Dissimilarity threshold T is used to pick less
likely interactions as negative examples. We need to define an opti—
mal value for the dissimilarity threshold (T*) that best serve this pur—
pose. According to the twilight zone concept of protein sequence
alignments, when the sequence identity score between a pair of pro—
teins falls below 20%, structure similarity between them is minimal
(Rost, 1999). Considering the central dogma of genomics (sequence
determines structure determines function), by selecting T”r at 0.8
(which corresponds to 20% sequence similarity), we increase the
probability that the two proteins have no similar interaction inter—
faces, and consequently they are less likely to share an interaction
partner. Thus, if viral proteins x and y interact with human proteins
hx and hy, respectively, and the dissimilarity distance between x and
y is >0.8, then x is less likely to interact with h,, and thus the pair
(x, hy) can serve as a negative (unlikely) interaction.

2.5 Data partitioning

Partitioning requirements. We need to divide the data set into train—
ing and testing subsets such that the testing subset contains inter—
actions of viruses taxonomically far from those in the training set in
a way that imitates predicting for a novel virus (or for a known virus
with no or few known interactions). Additionally, we are interested
in dividing the entire data set into multiple subsets, each of which
can serve as a testing subset, while the remaining subsets are
grouped into a corresponding training subset (Section 2.2). A ran—
dom split cannot satisfy these requirements.

Taxonomy rank as partitioning criterion. When a novel virus
emerges, it is more likely to be of a low taxonomy rank (an isolate
or strain) than to be of higher rank (a species or genus), because a
new virus typically evolves from known ones. However, we cannot
specify a fixed taxonomy rank (species for example) as a partition—
ing criterion because the branches of the viral taxonomy tree signifi—
cantly vary in length (Supplementary Material 54). Some subsets
would carry interactions of viral proteins nearly identical or entirely
different from the other viral proteins in the remaining subsets, mak—
ing performance evaluation inconsistent.

Criterion 1 (partial blindness). In this scheme, interactions associ—
ated with leaf nodes under the same immediate ancestor in the viral
taxonomy tree are grouped together into a single subset. This

partitioning makes interactions from very related viruses (and conse—
quently related viral proteins) fall into the same testing subset, but
still allows some more distantly related viral proteins in the same
virus family to be utilized in training (as they fall in some other sub—
sets), hence the name partial blindness. See Supplementary Material
510 for an example. The testing, in this case, will be equivalent to
predicting for a novel virus of the same rank as the ancestor of the
testing subset.

Criterion 2 (complete blindness). We want to examine how the
framework performs in the case of a novel virus that not only has no
known interactions, but also its proteins have no strong sequence
similarities with any viral protein in the training set (Hypothesis 3,
Section 2.3). To test this case, we need to make the viral proteins in
the testing set S completely dissimilar in sequence to all viral pro—
teins in the training set R. We thus developed the complete blindness
criterion to describe this requirement: interactions of viral proteins
within the same viral family are grouped together into a single sub—
set. Members of a single viral family share some similarity in se—
quence among themselves and no similarities to the other viral
families (according to the ICTV taxonomy).

2.6 Learning model

Features. We used a feature extraction scheme developed for intra—
species PPI prediction and successfully adapted to the inter—species
case (Cui et al., 2012; Dyer et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2007). It first
clusters the 20 amino acids based on similarities of physiochemical
properties known to drive most PPIs (dipoles and volumes of side
chains). Residues of each protein are mapped to the corresponding
cluster numbers. The frequency of each possible 3—mer is calculated
in each mapped protein, generating a feature vector that is then nor—
malized over [0,1] for each protein independently. The two normal—
ized vectors of an interacting (or negative) pair are concatenated
into a single feature vector representing the interaction. See
Supplementary Material 51 1 for more details.

Classification model. We used support vector machines (SVMs) for
their classification power and ability to tolerate high noise (Ben-Hur
and Weston, 2010). We used the radial basis function kernel
K(u,v) : exp(—y * (u — vlz) and the SVM implementation from
LIBSVM version 3.1 8 (Chang and Lin, 2011).

Model parameters. To pick optimal values for the model parameters
C (error penalty) and y (the kernel parameter), a grid search over C
and V was performed with nested 5—fold cross—validation. Five expo—
nentially—spaced values for each parameter were used; C in the range
[1073,101] and y in [104,100], as suggested by best practice (Chang
and Lin, 2011). The search was conducted at each value of the dis—
similarity threshold Tin the range [0,1] with a 0.1 step by training
and testing SVM models on each training—testing pair for each
(C,y, T) combination. The resultant optimal parameter values are
C" : 10 and y" : 10—3 (see Supplementary Material 51).

Partitioning. The data set was divided into 49 and 10 subsets
according to Criteria 1 and 2, respectively. The im subset was used
for testing at a time against a model trained on the interactions from
all the remaining subsets, forming the it}? (R, S) training—testing pair.
A negative to positive examples ratio of 1:1 is maintained through—
out the study. Rounds of training and testing were performed over
the different pairs with different dissimilarity thresholds T. The

performance of the system was averaged over the entire data set for
each of the partitioning schemes. Thus, no data are lost in testing while
the performance evaluation is consistent with the goal of the study.

Accuracy measures. The performance was evaluated using standard
accuracy, sensitivity and specificity for each (R, S) pair (Nourani
et al., 2015). We also report the support vector ratio for each model
and prediction confidence. To quantify the overall performance
across all the different (R, S) pairs, averages of the above measures
were calculated (for each parameter value set), weighted by the sam—
ple size of the testing unit S in each pair.

2.7 Pilot and generalization studies

We conducted a set of pilot studies to assess DeNovo generalization
and robustness. Each study is denoted STx, where x is the study
number, for ease of reference. See Supplementary Material 512 for
details of these studies.

Generalization to bacteria. ST1 examines how well DeNovo gener—
alizes to predict bacteria—human PPIs for a novel bacterium. It also
compares DeNovo performance to a recent transfer learning ap—
proach (Kshirsagar et al., 2013). ST2—trained DeNovo on PPIs of
Arabidopsis thaliana with a specific bacterium and tested the model
on PPIs from other pathogens with A.thaliana. DeNovo was further
trained on all VirusMentha virus—human PPIs and tested on bac—
teria—human PPIs in ST3.

Generalization within viruses. DeNovo was tested on virus—human
PPIs for foreign viral and human proteins (not in the training set) in
ST4, and on PPIs of foreign viral proteins with known human pro—
teins in ST5. ST4 and ST5 work as application scenarios on how to
use DeNovo to estimate the probability of a list of putative PPIs of a
novel virus (ST4) and to generate a list of interacting and/or non—
interacting human partners for that virus (ST5).

Assessing sequence-based features. Assessing how adding SLiM fea—
tures may improve DeNovo accuracy, in ST6 we masked the SLiMs
known in the viral proteins, grouped the PPIs of these proteins into
a testing data set, trained DeNovo on the remaining PPIs, and com—
pared the prediction accuracy when the SLiMs were masked and not
masked.

Comparing with data mining-based learning and sampling. To com—
pare DeNovo to data mining techniques, ST7 used a one—class classi—
fier to model the true PPIs in both grouping schemes by training and
testing on positive PPIs of different sets to assess how much true
interactions these techniques may capture. In ST8, we compared our
negative sampling method to one recently proposed (Mei and Zhu,
2015), which uses one—class SVMs to separate true PPIs into posi—
tives and negatives. We used that method on the ten viral family
sets, and further tested the models on our negative samples of these
families. We additionally compared the result of splitting the PPIs
into positive and negatives against their original confidence score.

3 Results and discussion

DeNovo makes it possible to predict PPIs of a novel virus with
human accurately by using PPIs from different viruses, sequence—
based features and our negative sampling method. The results dem—
onstrate the generalization and robustness of DeNovo.

roughly corresponds to one of the human herpesvirus types. Similarly,
human viral types of Adenoviridae and Papillomaviridae fall into five
and seven subsets, respectively.

Partitioning and negative sampling. Prediction in the case of partial
blindness is more accurate and more confident than with full blind—
ness partitioning; see Figure 2. However, partitioning does not affect
and is not affected by the negative sampling at T”r : 0.8. At this
threshold (in both schemes), negative human partners are picked
from the partners of the other viral proteins that are placed in the
midnight zone with respect to the viral protein in question. The pur—
pose of partitioning is to simulate the situation of a novel virus, not
to aid the negative sampling.

Learning. The accuracy difference between the two schemes is ex—
plained by and supports Hypothesis 3. In the partial blindness case,
PPIs from related viral proteins (to the ones in testing) contribute to
the training set, making the learning task easier. Testing on all inter—
actions from a single family means that the model is not trained on
any viral proteins with sequence similarity to the ones in testing.
Thus, the model learns most of the discriminating features with re—
spect to human proteins and other viral proteins and may miss some
features that distinguish the interactions of the foreign viral proteins.
This result confirms the generalization characteristic of DeNovo and
further supports our learning hypothesis (Hypothesis 1).

3.3 Features

Sequence-based features. The main reason we utilize sequence—based
features is to maintain generalization of DeNovo to any other PPI
domain and to maintain prediction ability to any novel virus once its
proteins are sequenced. Advanced features [structure, gene ontology
(GO) or interaction domains] require prior knowledge that can be
difficult and time—consuming to obtain (Guo et al., 2008; Shen et al.,
2007). Sequence dissimilarity among viral families hampers using
homology—based and structure—based features in novel virus—host PPI
prediction. Amino acid sequence information has been proven to be
sufficient for PPI prediction (Guo et al., 2008) (we also demon—
strated this in Section 3.4).

Domain-based features. Although domain—based prediction is applied
(on a limited scale) in the pathogen—host area (Zhou et al., 2013b), appli—
cation for novel virus prediction needs prior knowledge of virus domains
and related information (Nourani et al., 2015). As such knowledge is
not available for many viruses and is difficult to obtain, one solution is
to predict viral domains computationally for new viral proteins and
apply domain—based methods on them. However, viral proteins are
mostly loosely packed, enriched in disordered regions (Tokuriki et al.,
2009), or of unknown and unmapped structure (Perdigao et al., 2015 ),
making prediction of viral domains questionable.

SLiM-based features. Similarly, domain—based methods that use
SLiMs in predicting viral PPIs face the same objections: the general—
ization problem for lack of data, and difficulty of SLiM prediction
(for SLiMs are short and degenerate in nature). Some studies assign
viral proteins whose sequences are predicted or known to have
SLiMs similar to ones known in human as interacting candidates
with human proteins carrying the corresponding counter domains
(Evans et al., 2009; Sarmady, 2010). These methods are limited by
the 239 known human SLiM classes and the 219 known viral SLiM
instances (Dinkel et al., 2013).

We assessed how sequence motif information may help to im—
prove the accuracy of DeNovo prediction by masking the viral
SLiMs in testing PPIs (Study ST6 in Section 2.7). No change in ac—
curacy was observed (Supplementary Material 512), suggesting that
SVMs capture other interaction associated features that are suffi—
cient to make the discrimination, or the available number of SLiMs
is insufficient to make a difference.

3.4 Prediction approach

We reasoned that our negative sampling method is robust and not
biased (Section 3.1). We thus find classic machine learning (which
requires addressing the challenge of negative sampling) more suit—
able for the domain of predicting PPI of a novel virus than data min—
ing and transfer learning approaches, as discussed below.

Data mining. In data mining—based learning, a putative PPI is classi—
fied as likely or unlikely based on its similarity to the known PPIs,
without the need of negative examples. Our main concern is that
dissimilarities among viral families are likely to cause a model repre—
senting true PPIs to be insufficient to describe interactions of foreign
viruses. We tested this hypothesis in Study ST7 (Section 2.7). With a
similarity threshold of 0.5, accuracies of 38% and 25% were ob—
tained for partitioning schemes 1 and 2, respectively. These low
accuracies suggest that modeling true PPIs of some viruses is insuffi—
cient to capture interaction—discriminating features for other viruses.

Transfer learning. Our concern of using transfer learning in virus—
host PPI prediction for novel viruses is the need of prior knowledge
to design a transfer function specific for each novel virus. We com—
pared the performance of DeNovo, which uses sequence—based fea—
tures, with transfer learning that uses more advanced features
(Kshirsagar et al., 2013) on PPIs from 3 bacterial pathogens of dif—
ferent taxonomic orders (Study ST1 in Section 2.7). With near opti—
mal accuracy of 97% and low support vector ratio, DeNovo
demonstrates that its use of SVMs is sufficient (and probably a bet—
ter fit) to capture discriminative features that otherwise need to be
explicitly modeled in transfer learning. Another study uses hom—
ology knowledge transfer of GO features in HIV proteins (Mei,
2013). Such advanced features hamper generalization to most
viruses where GO data can be time—consuming and a challenge to
obtain.

3.5 Generalization

DeNovo generalizes well. We tested our model on five data sets as—
sessing how it behaves in different pathogen domains, across patho—
gens with a shared host and on PPIs whose protein partners are
foreign to the model. These tests demonstrate how to apply DeNovo
and its generalization ability and robustness. However, we did not
examine generalization to non—human host PPIs with viral proteins
due to lack of data.

We used DeNovo on three PPI sets from different bacteria with
human (Study ST1). Each set was tested once against a model
trained on the other two, similar to the Criterion 2 scenario.
DeNovo achieved average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and sup—
port vector ratio of 97%, 94.5, 97.5 and 28.8, 94.5%, 97.5%, and
28.8%, respectively. This near—optimal result demonstrates the pre—
diction ability of DeNovo. It also shows how predicting for bacteria
is easier than for novel viruses, for bacteria do not have the dissimi—

virus—human PPIs and tested on bacteria—human PPIs (Study ST3).
The model could recognize up to 69% of the tested PPIs. DeNovo
was further trained on PPIs from a plant host with a bacterial patho—
gen and tested on proteins of different pathogens (viruses, fungi, and
bacteria) that target the same host (Study ST2). Sensitivity reached
84.6%, while specificity was 65%, reflecting some differences of
these pathogen proteins and/or their interaction interfaces.

When DeNovo was tested on PPIs from viral proteins foreign to
VirusMentha, it correctly classified 94% of them (Study ST5).
When both human and viral proteins were foreign (Study ST4), the
prediction accuracy was approximately the same. This result sup—
ports our learning hypothesis (Hypothesis 1) that DeNovo can learn
with respect to host proteins rather than specific viral proteins.

4 Conclusion

We introduced the problem of predicting virus—human PPIs for a
novel virus, for which we do not have any known interactions. Our
proposed solution, DeNovo, solved this problem efficiently by (i) ex—
ploiting the known PPIs between a large number of viruses and their
shared host (human) to learn from; (ii) introducing a method to re—
duce the expected noise in generating the negative PPI examples
from the true ones; and (iii) partitioning the data set in a way that
simulates the situation of a novel virus, hence makes performance
evaluation realistic. The model achieved significantly high accuracy
while only using protein sequences to learn and predict, making the
prediction possible for virtually any virus infecting human. We dem—
onstrated that DeNovo generalizes well, and is robust and biologic—
ally sound.

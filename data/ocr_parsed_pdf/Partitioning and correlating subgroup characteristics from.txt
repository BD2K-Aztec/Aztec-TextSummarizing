Abstract

Motivation: Evolutionarin conserved amino acids within proteins characterize functional or struc—
tural regions. Conversely, less conserved amino acids within these regions are generally areas of
evolutionary divergence. A priori knowledge of biological function and species can help interpret
the amino acid differences between sequences. However, this information is often erroneous or un—
available, hampering discovery with supervised algorithms. Also, most of the current unsupervised
methods depend on full sequence similarity, which become inaccurate when proteins diverge (e.g.
inversions, deletions, insertions). Due to these and other shortcomings, we developed a novel un—
supervised algorithm which discovers highly conserved regions and uses two types of information
measures: (i) data measures computed from input sequences; and (ii) class measures computed
using a priori class groupings in order to reveal subgroups (i.e. classes) or functional
characteristics.

Results: Using known and putative sequences of two proteins belonging to a relatively uncharac—
terized protein family we were able to group evolutionarily related sequences and identify con—
served regions, which are strong homologous association patterns called Aligned Pattern Clusters,
within individual proteins and across the members of this family. An initial synthetic demonstration
and in silico results reveal that (i) the data measures are unbiased and (ii) our class measures can
accurately rank the quality of the evolutionarily relevant groupings. Furthermore, combining our
data and class measures allowed us to interpret the results by inferring regions of biological im—
portance within the binding domain of these proteins. Compared to popular supervised methods,
our algorithm has a superior runtime and comparable accuracy.

the class A scavenger receptors, whose evolutionary origin and re—
latedness has been previously described based on phylogenic
approaches (Whelan et al., 2012; Yap et al., 2015), we demonstrate
that our method is as effective as multiple sequence alignments for
motif discovery. In addition, our algorithm is more effective in
grouping the two proteins across a wide range of organisms, includ—
ing the identification of conserved and mutated amino acids within
each protein and across the family of proteins, thus identifying re—
gions of potential functional significance amongst homologs and
orthologs.

Protein families can consist of many thousands of members, and
the distinction between these members becomes less clear with
greater evolutionary distance. In supervised learning (also known as
classification), the groups are predetermined as a priori knowledge,
given as class labels, and the model is optimally learned to predict
those labels (Leslie et al., 2002). In unsupervised clustering, the sam—
ples (i.e. sequences) are grouped or partitioned based on their simi—
larity (Perner and Rosenfeld, 2003) or common features (i.e. amino
acid sequences/motifs with strong statistical association usually
along the entire sequence) (Durston et al., 2012). To show the
uniqueness of our approach, we propose the following problem def—
inition: Given a set of input sequences in pre—existing groups (i.e.
with class labels), our algorithm discovers subsequences (i.e. motifs/
regions) with strong statistical association which distinguishes sub—
groups within the data and in turn reveal other biologically relevant
information. We can rank the quality of these discovered patterns,
and group their inherent characteristics using our data measures.
By then using our class measures, we can identify whether these
discovered patterns and their amino acid mutations partitioned
subgroups match the pre—existing groups as reﬂected by the class
labels.

An example using the well—known cytochrome c protein (Fig. 1)
is used to illustrate how local patterns can be related to species.
Here the sequence patterns CAECH, CAWCH and CLQCH appear
in the input sequences describing three class groups, namely plant,
mammal and fungi. If these patterns were conserved amino acid se—
quences with presumed functional significance, the aligned patterns
could reveal similarities and/or differences for associating with the
species (i.e. classes). Once conserved regions and their associated
patterns are localized, information measures are able to partition
group or class characteristics from the aligned patterns. Such infor—
mation can then be used to describe the classes as well as to justify
and assist classification.

1.1 Motivations

We developed an unsupervised algorithm to discover regions of po—
tential functional importance which is (i) ﬂexible in pattern
length and number of mutations and (ii) enriched with pattern
and data representations for correlating subgroups. Our new un—
supervised method, called WeMine—APC, first discovers non—redun—
dant, statistically significant sequence patterns from a sequence
family to create Aligned Pattern Clusters (APCs) (Lee and Wong,
2013; Wong et al., 2012), which are clusters of sequence patterns
that are aligned to localize the correlation of the amino acids within
a region.

Therefore, we introduce the concept of pattern—data spaces
(Wong and Li, 2008) (Fig. 2). The pattern space consists of the
aligned patterns within the APC and the data space is formed by the
occurrences of the subsequences containing the aligned patterns of
the APC, i.e. the array of sequence data formed by all the subse—
quence occurrences or instances of the aligned patterns in the APC

with sequence ID and location given (Wong et al., 2012). First, from
the pattern space, the patterns are discovered as statistical associ—
ations with ranking in the localized region. Next, from the data
space, the information measures are computed to reveal partitions
of the patterns and data as well as amino acid mutations within and
between the aligned columns. Thus, all the probability used to de—
fine information measures are derived from the data space of the
APC. Further role of the pattern—data space is summarized in supple
mentary materials.

Because the data space contains a localized region correlating the
sequences, distinct protein family subgroups can be revealed in a
natural manner. Thus, both amino acid conservation and mutation
within an APC can help partitioning the proteins data using simple
information measures. This paper proposes two types of quantified
information measures to assess the ability of our unsupervised clus—
tering algorithm to obtain natural partitions within the data region
(Fig. 1, Step 3). They are (i) data measures that assess natural parti—
tions that reveal inherent characteristics of subgroups within the
data induced by the APC; and (ii) class measures that assess the cor—
relation of the constituent representations of APCs such as sequence
patterns, amino acid mutation sites (columns) and specific amino
acids that are identified from the data based upon the external class
labels.

2 Methods

The proposed methodology (Fig. 1) is separated into two parts: (i)
constructing APCs to reveal subgroups and/or classes; and (ii) using
appropriate information measures to assess either the natural data
partitions or the inherent subgroup class characteristics (Fig. 2). At
the onset of unsupervised clustering, a priori class labels obtained
externally are not incorporated into the pattern discovery process.
Without using external class labels, APCs discovered with their in—
formative sites of conservation and/or mutations are used to disclose
natural partitions within the data. Once the natural partitions are
found, externally collected class labels are then incorporated to com—
pute the information measures so as to ascertain how closely the ex—
ternal class labels correspond to the natural partitions obtained. We
use a biological example from the results (Fig. 3) to demonstrate the
usefulness of our information measures.

2.1 Constructing APCs to reveal subgroups/classes

An APC is defined as a set of sequence patterns clustered together
based on their aligned similarities. By allowing ﬂexible mutations,
APC maximizes the column—wise (vertical) similarity of the amino
acids at each position while minimizing subgroup mutations be—
tween the sequence patterns. Since pattern alignment begins with
statistically significant patterns, the AP clustering process (i) is faster
due to its pattern—based clustering which takes advantage of the
strong statistical constraints among the sequence patterns rather
than considering all possible combinations of site mutations such as
in most typical motif finding algorithms; (ii) is a ﬂexible algorithm
that relaxes the constraints of specific length, and number of muta—
tions, as well as the amount of sequence coverage; (iii) renders a
more practical ranking due to the alignment of multiple homologous
local patterns as one cluster. When frameshifts occur, weak APCs
allowing frameshift mutations could be adopted (Wong et al., 2013)
but will not be tackled in this paper. If frameshift mutations are con—
served, they will be clustered into separate APCs. Hence, WeMine—
APC significantly improves the discovery and interpretation of local
functional subgroups for a large class of data.

3b. Input Species Class Label

Fig. 1. An example using cytochrome cto illustrate the use of our unsupervised approach and information measures for partitioning and correlating subgroup
characteristics for conserved regions. The input contains protein sequences with the discovered patterns for the proximal binding site (coloured). Each sequence
belongs to a species group (i.e. class) of either mammal (red), plant (green) or fungi (blue). Overall, our approach involves two steps (Step 2 and Step 3). First in
Step 2, an unsupervised algorithm clusters, aligns and partitions patterns simultaneously into an Aligned Pattern Cluster (APC). Our algorithm, WeMine-APC,
marks, aligns and extracts a data block covering all the discovered patterns in the APC. We refer the data block as the data space that is constructed from the APC
to represent a conserved region of the protein. Second, information measures are used for assessing the amino acid mutations in the natural data partitions (3a)
and a priori class labels (3b), respectively, in the data space of the APC. Step 1a. At the onset of unsupervised clustering, a priori class labels obtained externally
are not incorporated into the pattern discovery process. Step 2. Without using external class labels, an APC with specific conservations and mutations are dis-
covered from sequence data in order to reveal natural partitions within the region. Step 3. Two types of information measures reveal partitions: data measures
using only the sequence input; and class measures using the additional class labels. Step 3a. The natural partitions of an APC are measured based on data meas-
ure SR2 (a measure of interdependence of a column with all other columns in the APC) Step 3b. The a priori class labels are further input in Step 3b to associate
with partitions of patterns (rows) and of mutations (columns) based on two class measures, Class Entropy and Information Gain (Color version of this figure is

available at Bioinformatics online.)

Let the alphabet 2 be a collection of amino acids including
the wildcard symbol, *, and the gap symbol, —, and let the pattern
{p : 0102 . .. an be statistically significant ordered sequences con—
taining symbols from 2, where 01 E 2. The APC is then a set of simi—
lar patterns of different lengths that is simultaneously assembled
into an aligned set of patterns that are sequence segments of the
same length by appropriately inserting gaps and wildcards.

DEFINITION

Let an APC (Lee and Wong, 2013) be defined as:

at a}.
C: 3  g (17)
0'1"  (Tum mxn

In the context of the above APC notation, the 1th row vector (or
segment) of C contains the aligned pattern 17,-, for i :
1, ..., m, where each pattern is of length n. We use 6,- to denote
the jth column, for/ : 1, . . . , u.

2.2 Computing the information measures for
quantifying subgroup partitions
There are two types of information measures to be considered. The
first is the data measure that is unaffected by class label biases. It is
derived from the natural partitions within the data, reﬂecting its in—
herent varied functional characteristics. The second is referred to as
the class measure that quantifies the strength of a constituent repre—
sentation of an APC associated with the externally acquired class
labels, as well as their quality. It is for comparing and assessing the
class partition against the natural partition inherent in the data.
Together, there are four measures as presented in Table 1. The
two data measures are (i) data entropy, and (ii) normalized sum of

mutual information redundancy (SR2) (Wang and Wong, 1978).
The two class measures are (i) class entropy (H) for the APC and its
sub—components, such as the APC itself, its patterns, and its distinct
amino acids therein; and (ii) class information gain (IG) for aligned
columns. These measures are based on the theoretic definitions of:
(ii) Shannon’s information entropy (Shannon, 2001; Strait and
Dewey, 1996), (ii) mutual information and (iii) the change in infor—
mation entropy (i.e. information gain). Detailed equations for the
data and class measures can be found in supplementary materials
Section 1.5 and 1.6, respectively.

2.3 A biologically relevant example using members of
the class a scavenger receptor protein family

Within our results, we chose to focus on those which contain cyst—
eine residues responsible for the disulfide bonds in the terminal do—
main of the cA—SRs. The 2nd highest scoring APC (Fig. 3b) displays
five sequence patterns and thirteen aligned columns. The dataset
contains five relevant patterns CRMLGYS, CRSLGY, VFCRMLG,
SDATVFCRMLGYS and DATVFCRMLGYS. First considering
class measures, the pattern 171 : CRMLGYS has a class entropy of
Hy(p1) : o with I? : ((MARCO; 17), (SRAI; 0)) and the pattern
172 :CRSLGYS has a class entropy of Hy(p2) : 0 with
if : ((MARCO; 0) and (SRAI; 15)). In the same table, the APC has
a class entropy of Hy(C) : 0.99, which all the aligned columns also
share. In aligned column 432, amino acid M has the class entropy 0
and amino acid S has class entropy 0, indicating that both are per—
fect partitions of the proteins MARCO and SRAI that lead to an in—
formation gain of 1. Next considering data measures, aligned
column 432 has the second highest SR2 : 0.36; furthermore, aligned
column 436 has the highest SR2 : 0.41.

Fig. 2. The pattern and data spaces of apcs and the use of information measures for class and natural data partitioning. A segment is a sub-sequence of a full se-
quence. A region is considered as an area in the set of input sequences consisting of several related segments. The interdependent association of amino acids
that comprise the segment itself and vertically accounted by amino acids conserved or mutated on a site (or column) are defined as (a) pattern Space of APCs:
the set of aligned patterns in an APC with statistical ranking, statistical residuals and probability distribution; (b) data space of an APC (or pattern induced data
space of an APC): a rectangular array of sequence data covering all the aligned patterns in the APC with sequence id and pattern location given in each row of the
block. (0) Natural data partitions subdivide the input sample sequences by the feature in the APC Data Space, such as amino acid mutations or aligned columns.
It is considered natural because it is based on the data feature itselfand not obtained from external a priori knowledge such as class labels. Data Measures H and
SR2 are obtained from the data space to reveal the natural data partitions. In c, columns with low H contains specific amino acid (such as A0). Columns with High
SR2 (those with A3 and A4) are those with strong interdependence with other columns (those with A1 and A2) within the APC. Class partitions subdivide the sam-
ples by the class labels that were given as a priori knowledge. (d) Class measures such as class entropy and information gain relate APC representation (such as
patterns, columns and distinct amino acids in specific columns) with the class labels. Low entropy and high information gain suggest that their strong association
with a specific class, the reverse suggests the association with more classes. Amino acid partitions further subdivide the samples by their aligned column using
the different amino acid mutations in that column. Distinct amino acids like A3 reveal a correlation to Class 1, whereas A4 correlates to Class 2 (Color version of
this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

Fig. 3. Top Ranking APCs containing cysteine residues from the SRCR binding domain. MARCO and SRAI proteins have both evolved to have very unique func-
tions which are likely to be expressed within their protein sequences. Members of this family possess protein sequences which share domains of high conserva-
tion as well as areas of dissimilarity. (a) From the discovered APCs that are in the SRCR binding domain, amino acid mutations from two top-ranking APCs (2nd
APC: SDATVFCR[MS]LGYS; 6th APC: H[SN]EDAGV[ET]CT) have relatively high SR2 and 16 (yellow ellipses) and separate the data space of these two APCs into
the MARCO and SRAI classes. The cysteine-cysteine disulfide bond is between the 460 aligned column of the second APC, and 518 aligned column of the sixth
APC. The data space of the SRCR domain and the cysteine residues highlighted in yellow, the coloured regions are the APCs clustered in this particular co-occur-
rence graph (not shown here) (Lee et al., 2014). In particular, these two APCs highly co-occur across protein sequences. (b) The second APC
SDATVFCR[MS]LGYS. The APC is represented in table form. Each numbered row associates with a statistically significant pattern and each numbered column
is an aligned column of amino acids, which are either conserved or mutated. The instance counts of the patterns for MARCO and SRAI are listed on the right
hand columns labelled with MARCO in pink and SRAI in green. The Class Entropy of each pattern and the APC is displayed in the last column with the heading
H and each amino acid is displayed below the patterns; additionally, the SR2 and 16 is summarized at the bottom. Note that the aligned column 432 [MS] is a
strong class partition due to its perfect 16 of 1 where M corresponds to MARCO and S to SRAI. Next, we evaluate the top SR2 class measure for each APC to help
interpret the data partition. The aligned column 432 with high SR2 is a [S] amino acid mutation. (c) The sixth APC H[SN]EDAGV[ET]CT. The APC is read similarly
to (b), except that the top ranking aligned column for class partition measure (IG) is the same as the data partition measure (SR2). The aligned column 466
[ET] with the highest SR2 is also a strong data partition column with E corresponding to MARCO and T to SRAI in addition to being the strong class partition with
highest (Color version of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

natural partitions in the data. When the class labels of the amino 3.2.2 Rankingamino acid partition

acid mutations are correct, the value of IG is close to 1, indicating
that the natural data partitions resulting from the amino acid infor—
mation strongly correlates with the class labels. However, when the
natural data partitions only weakly correlate with the class labels,
the value of IG is low. The natural data partitions are based on com—
position of the amino acid in the input sequence and class partitions
are based on the a priori class labels. IG measures how close these
two different partitions agree with one another.

In Table 2, we observe that the sequence columns containing
mutated amino acids follow the same order when ranked by data
measures (SR2) as well as with class measures (IG). This indicates
that both of these partition measures are able to qualify the natural
partitions in the dataset. However, when the representation contains
only one type of class label, the value of IG is always zero while the
value of SR2 is still non—zero. Therefore, SR2 is a more robust meas—
ure than IG due to its ability to rank single class amino acid

mutations. So when the class labels are not computable by IG, SR2
can still assess the data partitions, which likely correspond to the
natural subclasses in the data.

3.2.3 Disulfide bonds in the top ranking aligned columns

The SRCR domain in the cA—SR contains 6 cysteine residues paired
into 3 disulfide bonds that are important for its three—dimensional
structure (Yap et al. 2015). We observe that five top—ranking APCs
overlap or are adjacent to a conserved cysteine residue (Table 2).
We discover all six cysteines in the disulfide bonds: where three are

Fig. 4. Class label quality greatly affects the acquired class information gain
(IG). Class IG can be used to measure the quality of the external class labels,
i.e. how well class partitions correlate with data partitions. The aligned column
with maximum IG from each APC is presented as a bar graph: the blue bar is
class IG computed using the good gene class labels and the red bar is the class
IG computed with the poor species labels. Some APCs have IG of 0 for both
gene class labels and species class labels because they occur within only one
class (Color version of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

Table 2. The top 14 APCs ranked by partition measures SR2 and IG

directly in a good—partitioning APC, two in a poor—partitioning APC
and one is directly adjacent to an APC. Furthermore, two cysteines
(C bold and underscored) in the top APCs (top 2nd APC and top 6th
APC, Table 2) directly bind with one another in a disulfide bond
(Fig. 3a). Furthermore, each APC contains amino acid mutations
that correlate precisely with the class labels (Fig. 3b).

To demonstrate the biological interpretability of our information
measures, the second and sixth APCs were examined in full detail
(Fig. 3b, c, respectively). First, we evaluate the top IG class measure
for each APC to help interpret the class partitions. Next, we evaluate
the top SR2 class measure for each APC to interpret the data parti—
tion as stated in the caption. Note that the top IG and SR2 are the
same in the top second APC but different for the top sixth APC.

4 Discussion

In this study (Table 2), we observed 7 out of the top 14 APCs with
positive IG scores that were able to partition the cA—SRs. Three of
these APCs have amino acid mutations with an IG value of 1, indi—
cating that they partitioned the protein classes precisely. These
APCs contain amino acid mutations that are natural data partitions
that match the class partitions. Some of these partitions have been
observed previously and are thought to explain some of the func—
tional differences between these proteins. For example, both
MARCO and SRAI contain a ligand binding, Scavenger Receptor
Cysteine Rich (SRCR) domain. MARCO’s SRCR domain contains a
motif (RGRAEVYYSGT) which is not shared by SRAI and is
thought to explain some of the differences in the ligand binding
capabilities of these two receptors (Brannstrom et al., 2002).
WeMine—APC correctly identifies this motif as in the 11th ranking
APC, NRGRAEVYY. Consistent with previous results, this motif is
only found within the MARCO class and not within any SRAI se—
quence . Additionally, the ninth ranking APC, WGT[IV]CDDRW,
was also recently identified by Yap et al. (2015) via FastML and is
hypothesized to be important structurally given its inclusion of a
conserved cysteine residue. This demonstrates that SR2 can reveal
subclass dependency even when class labels are unreliable or IG is 0.
In summary, both of these patterns have been previously identified
with methods other than WeMine—APC to represent motifs of

known functional importance.

Therefore, WeMine—APC is able to assess the impact of an amino acid mutation by partitioning the protein sequences by related APC patterns and their amino

acid mutations to the regions in the protein and their relation with the class labels.

MARCO and SRAI; these novel motifs represent patterns of possible
future interest to the cA—SR field (Table 2). In particular, the second
APC, SDATTVFCR[MS]LGYS, is a perfect partition between
MARCO and SRAI and also contains a conserved cysteine necessary
for disulfide bonding. The sixth APC, H[SN]EDAGV[ET]CT, also
contains a conserved cysteine residue.

4.1 Comparison to supervised methods

To study the predictive power of WeMine—APC, supervised predic—
tion was implemented to compare against other currently available
supervised methods. The dataset described in the previous section
was separated into two parts: 70% training set and 30% testing set.
The training and testing sets are mutually exclusive and were ran—
domly selected. Both SVM and HMM are supervised learning meth—
ods; however, our method is unsupervised. As such, the WeMine—
APC algorithm was modified to predict class labels of an unknown
sequence (Supplementary Materials Section 1.9). The goal of our
modified supervised algorithm was to acquire a prediction for each
input sequence with unknown class labels based on the set of dis—
covered APCs that were generated from the training set
(Supplementary Materials Section 1.8).

4.1. 1 Rnntime comparisons

To determine the runtime advantage of our method, the training
and testing time of our method and other supervised methods is
measured. Our results show that the runtime for WeMine—APC is
much faster than HMM and SVM, due to the faster training time
(Table 3). The testing time is about the same as SVM because both
methods match patterns to make their predictions; however, the
testing time is much slower for HMM due to full sequence align—
ment. The training time for WeMine—APC is 16 times faster than
SVM and 37 times faster than HMM. This faster training runtime is
because an APC aligns statistically significant patterns instead of
matching all possible combinatorial mutations such as in SVM.
Training in WeMine—APC is substantially faster than HMM because
full sequence alignment is not required.

4. 1.2 Accuracy comparisons

To evaluate the accuracy of our method, class mislabeling was in—
jected into the training set to evaluate the robustness of accuracy
(see algorithm in Supplementary Materials Section 1.9). Our accur—
acy (Fig. 5) decreased after SVM but before HMM, implying that
HMM is robust to mislabeling due to the computationally expensive
pairwise full sequence alignment. Since APC is faster than both
SVM and HMM (Table 3), we recommend WeMine—APC to be used
for divergent sequences or sequences with mislabels, thus allowing
the discovery of conserved patterns, the measurement of label qual—
ity and the interpretation of the amino acid mutation.

pared against HMM and SVM with four different kernels. APC is able to cap-
ture subtle mutational difference for subgroup partition between the classes,
thus preserving a higher minimal accuracy of at least 10% and also gradual
slower decrease in accuracy than other methods

5 Conclusions

In this study, we demonstrated that unsupervised methods on local
functional regions are preferred over supervised algorithms because
they explore, analyze and organize the patterns discovered from the
data without relying on externally acquired class labels. However,
any unsupervised method should be assessed using data with reliable
external class labels in order to determine the accuracy of the
method in identifying class members within families. Hence, while
we utilized an unsupervised method to obtain the natural partitions
within the data, we also assessed the quality of the results using two
information measures to be justified by the externally collected class
labels, even if those class labels are not included or used in the clus—
tering phase.

APC uses two types of information measures: (i) data measures
which are unbiased by external class labels and (ii) class measures
which identify mislabeling errors. Our experiments demonstrate
that labeling quality of cA—SRs can be measured quantitatively and
the APC can make biological interpretations of disulfide bonds in
the SRCR binding domain. Compared to supervised methods, APC
has superior runtime and comparable accuracy. In conclusion, the
contributions of the data and class information measures are (i) un—
biased to class labels, (ii) interpretability of the mutations and the
data partition and (iii) APC classification being comparable to
supervised learning.

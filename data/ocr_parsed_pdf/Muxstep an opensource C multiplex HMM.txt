Abstract

Motivation: With the development of experimental methods and technology, we are able to reliably
gain access to data in larger quantities, dimensions and types. This has great potential for the im—
provement of machine learning (as the learning algorithms have access to a larger space of informa—
tion). However, conventional machine learning approaches used thus far on single—dimensional
data inputs are unlikely to be expressive enough to accurately model the problem in higher dimen—
sions; in fact, it should generally be most suitable to represent our underlying models as some form
of complex networksngmsio with nontrivial topological features. As the first step in establishing
such a trend, we present muxstep, an open—source library utilising multiplex networks for the pur—
poses of binary classification on multiple data types. The library is designed to be used out—of—the—
box for developing models based on the multiplex network framework, as well as easily modifiable
to suit problem modelling needs that may differ significantly from the default approach described.

1 Introduction

Machine learning algorithms that tackle problems such as classifica-
tion, clustering and decoding have been frequently found in a variety
of applications, a significant share of which is of bioinformatical na-
ture. Larraﬁaga et al. (2006) have presented a review of these appli-
cations, which includes but is not limited to knowledge extraction,
genomics and proteomics, systems biology and text mining. In a var-
iety of fields, perhaps especially bioinformatics, the algorithms can
be faced with learning from multiple types of data simultaneously.
The exact ways in which the processes producing each data type are
connected may well be unknown or incompletely understood, which
often results in having to make certain assumptions on their form
(to make the problem tractable).

One possible assumption is to model these ‘inter-process connec-
tions’ as multilayer networks (Kiveléi et (11., 2014); in particular, the

special case of multiplex networks could be very appropriate while
still maintaining tractability. Informally, a multiplex network is a
multi-layered graph in which each layer is built over the same set of
nodes, and there may exist edges between nodes in different layers.
This models. suitability arises from the fact that there exists a wide
variety of systems exhibiting ‘natural’ multiplexity: social networks
and epidemics modelling (Granell et (11., 2014), transportation net-
works (Cardillo et (11., 2013), biochemical and genetic networks
(Stark et (11., 2006) and research communities (De Domenico et (11.,
2015), to name a few.

We have developed the muxstep library motivated by the ex-
amples above, as the (to the best of our knowledge) first publicly
available machine learning library acquiring this methodology. The
problem we focus on is the very common problem of binary classifi-
cation (the Supplementary Materials also detail workflows that

discussed in the previous section and Supplementary Material);
this rises to a factor of 151.7 when fully utilizing the resource
with 8 threads. The equivalent factors for the REML stage are
5.4 (1 thread) and 13.7 (8 threads). The combined time for the
test case is reduced from ~17 h to ~11 min. We also measure the
REML analysis time for the same case using the ASReml soft—
ware (Gilmour et al., 2006) to be just under 5.5 h: this is a factor
of 76 times slower than ACTA (and a factor of 5.6 times slower
than GCTA). For discussion on the implementational differences
between GCTA and ASReml see (Yang et al., 2011).

Our adapted software, which we call ACTA is timely not least
because of the imminent arrival of sequencing data involving
large numbers of people and SNPs. There is an increase in the
number of re—sequencing projects and the imputation of large
numbers of GWAS samples to the one thousand genomes pro—
ject. There is an urgent need for efﬁcient computational tools,
and ACTA builds on the functionality offered by GCTA while

dramatically improving performance and hence the feasibility of
what can be practically achieved.

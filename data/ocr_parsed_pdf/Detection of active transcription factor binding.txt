ABSTRACT

Motivation: The identification of active transcriptional regulatory elem-
ents is crucial to understand regulatory networks driving cellular
processes such as cell development and the onset of diseases. It
has recently been shown that chromatin structure information, such
as DNase I hypersensitivity (DHS) or histone modifications, signifi-
cantly improves cell-specific predictions of transcription factor binding
sites. However, no method has so far successfully combined both
DHS and histone modification data to perform active binding site
prediction.

Results: We propose here a method based on hidden Markov models
to integrate DHS and histone modifications occupancy for the detec-
tion of open chromatin regions and active binding sites. We have
created a framework that includes treatment of genomic signals,
model training and genome-wide application. In a comparative
analysis, our method obtained a good trade-off between sensitivity
versus specificity and superior area under the curve statistics than
competing methods. Moreover, our technique does not require further
training or sequence information to generate binding location
predictions. Therefore, the method can be easily applied on new cell
types and allow flexible downstream analysis such as de novo motif
finding.

Availability and implementation: Our framework is available as part
of the Regulatory Genomics Toolbox. The software information and all
benchmarking data are available at http://costalab.org/wp/dh-hmm.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcriptional regulation orchestrates the proper temporal and
spatial expression of genes (Maston et al., 2006). The identiﬁca-
tion of transcriptional regulatory elements, such as transcription
factor binding sites (TFBSs), is crucial to understand regulatory

networks driving cellular processes such as cell development and
the onset of diseases. The standard approach is the use of se-
quence-based bioinformatics methods, which search over the
genome for motif-predicted binding sites (MPBSs) representing
the DNA binding sequence of a transcription factor (TF;
Stormo, 2000). This binding afﬁnity is usually represented by
models such as position weight matrices (PWMs). However,
motifs are generally short and have low information content.
Moreover, the presence of a sequence motif does not imply
actual TF binding in that particular cell type. As a result,
sequence-based methods return myriads of putative TFBSs, of
which only a small fraction is functional in a particular context
(Maston et al., 2006).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing
(ChIP-seq) allows the detection of TFBSs in vivo on a genome-
wide level (Landt et al., 2012). However, success of ChIP-seq
assays depends on the existence of a good antibody against
the TFs of interest and on the availability of large numbers
of cells. These two conditions are not always met in particular
for primary cells. Therefore, ChIP—seq-based studies are
restricted to the analysis of a small selection of TFs and cell
types (Kim et al., 2008; Ouyang et al., 2009) or require
the effort of large consortia (ENCODE Project Consortium,
2012).

Another solution is to explore the fact that an ‘open’ chroma-
tin structure is crucial and a prerequisite to the cell type-speciﬁc
binding of a TF to DNA (Arvey et al., 2012; Thurman et al.,
2012). For example, regions with histone modiﬁcation marks
H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 highlight active promoter and enhan-
cer elements (Bell et al., 2011). More detailed studies have
demonstrated that active TFBSs occur between two regions
with high active histone marks (peak-dip-peak pattern; Hon
et al., 2009). A classical method to detect active regulatory elem-
ents, DNase I footprinting, has also been recently combined with
sequencing to indicate open chromatin regions on a genome-wide
scale (Crawford et al., 2006). DNase-seq allows the identiﬁcation
of putative active TFBSs at base pair level resolution, i.e. 5720 bp
regions within two DNase-seq peaks represent the so-called foot-
prints, where TFs are likely to be bound. While DNase-seq
returns the exact position where DNA was nicked by DNase
I enzyme, ChIP-seq returns sequences centered on the protein

Fig. 1. Epigenetic grammar. (A) DHS (DNase-seq) and H3K4me3 (ChIP-seq) proﬁles around the promoter region of RCOR37REST corepressor 3 on
K562 cell type. The DNase-seq signal indicates three clear regions of DHS (HSl, HS2 and H83), each of which fits dip regions within the H3K4me3
signal. Moreover, these regions consist of several putative footprints of varied sizes. (B) Eight state HMM proposed. The ﬁrst state models background
signal (BACK). From the background state, the only possible transition is to the histone-level states, which will model the increase (UP), high levels (TOP)
and decrease (DOWN) of histone modiﬁcations. After visiting histone-level states, the HMM allows transitions to the DNase-level states, which again
model the increase, high levels and decrease in the DHS signal. Only then, the FOOTPRINT state can be visited. After a footprint visit, the HMM has to
go again to the DNase and histone-level states, emphasizing the peak-dip-peak pattern. We omit the self-transitions, which are present in all states, for

interacting with DNA. Therefore, DNase-seq gives a more
precise estimate of open chromatin than histone modiﬁcation
ChIP-seq, as reﬂected in the sharpness of the signal of DNase-
seq in comparison with H3K4me3 ChIP-seq signal (see Fig. 1A).
A recent evaluation of DNase-seq on >50 cell types indicated
that DNase I digestion patterns describe the topology of proteini
DNA binding interfaces and allowed the finding of 394 novel
motifs (Neph et al., 2012).

Several computational approaches explore open chromatin
evidence from ChIP-seq data or DNase I hypersensitivity
(DHS) sites to restrict the search space of sequence-based
analysis (Boyle et al., 2011; Cuellar-Partida et al., 2012;
Gusmao et al., 2012; Natarajan et al., 2012; Neph et al., 2012;
Pique-Regi et al., 2011; Whitington et al., 2009; Won et al.,
2010). They show a clear advantage in detecting active TFBSs,
as indicated by ChIP-seq evidence, in comparison with pure se-
quence-based methods.

1.1 Previous approaches

Previous approaches can be categorized in two distinct classes:
segmentation-based methods and site-centric methods.
Segmentation-based methods such as Boyle et a]. (2011), Neph
et al. (2012) and Won et a]. (2010), were based on the application
of hidden Markov models (HMMs) or sliding window methods
to segment the genome into open (and closed) chromatin region.
Won et al. (2010), for example, was based on the detection of
typical peak-dip-peak proﬁles of H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 his-
tone modifications indicative of active promoter and enhancer
regions. Afterwards, Boyle et a]. (2011) proposed an HMM
model to detect open chromatin/footprints in DHS signals on
a base pair resolution. Lastly, Neph et a]. (2012) applies a simple
sliding window approach that ﬁnds small regions (M0 bp) with
low DHS counts in the middle of regions (3710bp) with high
DHS counts. Site-centric methods, on the other hand, perform
predictions around MPBSs. For example, Pique-Regi et a].
(2011) first detects MPBSs then it applies an unsupervised

learning method that uses chromatin information to group
sites as active or inactive. This Bayesian method combines
DHS proﬁles and histone modiﬁcation summary statistics
around the TFBSs with priors derived from motif matching
bit-score, sequence conservation and distance to the nearest tran-
scription start site. Later, Cuellar-Partida et a]. (2012) improved
the methodology proposed in Whitington et a]. (2009) to include
the combination of DHS and distinct histone modiﬁcation as
priors in the detection of active MPBSs. They showed that
DHS improves TFBS detection considerably. Nevertheless, no
significant improvement was observed when DHS was combined
with histone modifications. Interestingly, Pique-Regi et a]. (2011)
also could not observe advantages in using histone modiﬁca-
tions. Note, however, that both Pique-Regi et a]. (2011) and
Cuellar-Partida et a]. (2012) use simple window-based statistics
for histone modiﬁcation, which are unable to detect peak-dip-
peak shapes as in Won et a]. (2010).

1.2 Our approach

We propose here an HMM-based approach to integrate both
DHS (DNase-seq) and histone modiﬁcations (ChIP-seq) for
the detection of open chromatin regions and active TFBSs. We
and others have previously observed that the peak-dip-peak pat-
terns of the DHS proﬁle happen inside the dip of the histone
modiﬁcation proﬁles (Gusmao et al., 2012; Kundaje et al., 2012;
see Fig. 1A). This indicates an underlying epigenetic grammar
behind active TFBSs: open chromatin regions (high DHS) are
ﬂanked by high or moderate signals of active histone marks.
These open chromatin regions consist of a sequence of one or
more footprints indicative of active TFBSs (low histone modiﬁ-
cation and DHS signals). We have therefore devised an HMM
(Fig. 1B) to model this epigenetic grammar by simultaneous ana-
lysis of DNase-seq and the ChIP-seq proﬁles of the histone
marks H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac and H2A.Z,
which are indicative of active regulatory regions, on a genome-
wide level. The HMM has as input a normalized and a slope

signal of DHS and one histone mark. It can therefore detect the
increase, top and decrease regions of both histone mark and
DHS signals. The HMM has multivariate Gaussian density func-
tions with full covariance matrices as emission functions to cap-
ture correlations between the DHS and histone marks signals. As
in Boyle et a]. (2011), we trained the HMM on the annotation of
a single genomic region. Moreover, we devised a normalization
procedure of the DHS/histone mark profiles to allow the appli-
cation of an HMM trained in a particular cell type to be applied
on any cell type of interest. This is the first approach combining
local genomic proﬁles of histone modiﬁcation and DHS for the
detection of open chromatin and active TFBSs. We evaluate our
and competing methods with public data from Hl-hESC and
K562 cell types. To validate our predictions, we created datasets
by combining MPBSs with ChIP-seq from 83 TFs.

2 METHOD

2.1 Epigenetic signal processing

Let the matrix X representing genomic signals be deﬁned as
X = {xij}D><N

where D is the number of genomic signals and N refers to the number of
bases in the genome. The ith genomic signal is represented by the vector

Xi>:1xi1, ---,Xi1v}
and the genomic signals at the jth position are represented as
er:1x1j, ---,XDj}

The ﬁrst processing step consists on creating a base-pair resolution
genomic coverage signal by counting the reads mapped to the genome.
For DHS data, we consider only the ﬁrst 5’ position of the aligned reads
(corresponding to the exact position at which DNase I enzyme has nicked
the DNA). For histone modiﬁcation ChIP-seq data, we extend all the
aligned reads to be 200 bp long, as this is the expected length of immu-
noprecipitated fragments. Then, in both cases, the resulting genomic
signal is created by counting how many reads overlapped at each genomic
position.

The signals are then normalized using an approach that addresses both
within- and between-dataset variability. For that, the genome is parti-
tioned into a set {b1, ..., bM} of non-overlapping bins and a set {r1, ..., rM}
of overlapping bins. Each bin bm covers the genomic coordinate interval
[((m — 1) > L)-l- 1, m > L], and rm represents bm extended by L/2 for both
sides. By using L = 5000, we partition the genome in regions with total
length 10 000. First, we apply a within-signal normalization by averaging
non-zero read counts inside bins (Boyle et al., 2011). For a given position
x,/, such that j e bm, we apply

Xnorml : xii

WEI", WEI",

(1)

where 1(>) denotes the indicator function. Next, we perform a between-
dataset scaling procedure following (Hon et al., 2009) to force values
inside the interval [0,1]. Assuming j e bm, this is done by applying a lo-
gistic function to the ﬁrst normalized values as follows:

rprmZ : 1
U 1 + e’(X;}MMI’P1m)/arm

where a,,=,/Z,,E,m(x,-w —u,,,)2/(2L). u,,,=ZwE,mx’.-::’m1/(2L) and

Pﬁm are, respectively, the SD, mean and the tth percentile of values

norml

(2)

x E rm.

To estimate the slope of the signals, we apply a Savitzkyﬂolay
smoothing ﬁlter. This method consists of ﬁtting the data into a second
order polynomial, performing a convolution (based on a speciﬁc window
length) with a vector containing Savitzkyﬂolay coefﬁcients (Madden,
1978). The window length was set to 9 bp (including the central element)
for DHS data (Boyle et al., 2011) and 201bp for histone modiﬁcation
ChIP-seq data, matching the read extension length. Next, the ﬁrst deriva-
tive is applied to the smoothed signal. The resulting signal represents the
slope of the normalized curve and assumes positive values when there is
an increase and negative values when there is a decrease. The slope sig-
nal will help the delineation of the start and end of DHS and histone
modiﬁcation peaks (see Supplementary Fig. S2 for examples of these
signals).

2.2 Prediction of footprints with HMMs

The HMM structure was designed to recognize the epigenetic gram-
mar described in Section 1.2. This segmentation task is performed
based on four input signals: the normalized and slope versions of
both DHS and a histone modiﬁcation. The structure, depicted in
Figure 1B can be interpreted as follows. The ﬁrst state (BACK) corres-
ponds to the ‘background’ regions with low concentration of DHS
and histone marks. The histone level states represent a peak in the
histone modiﬁcation signal, recognizing an increase in the histone
modiﬁcation signal based on high positive slope values (UP), summit
regions with slope values close to zero with high normalized values
(TOP) and a decrease based on negative values of the slope signal
(DOWN). From the histone level DOWN state, the model can either
return to BACK (isolated histone modiﬁcation peaks without further
DHS) or continue to the DNase level UP state. The DNase level states
are equivalent to the histone level states, with the exception that the
DHS normalized and slope signals are being recognized instead. From
the DNase level DOWN state, the model decides between returning to a
region of higher histone modiﬁcation signals (histone level UP state)
and visiting the FOOTPRINT state, which represents the dip between
two peaks of intense DHS. The regions of the genome where the
HMM has recognized as FOOTPRINT are the ones reported by our
method as likely TFBSs. See Supplementary Section 3.3 for alternative
HMM topologies.

More formally, for an observed multivariate sequence X and a hidden
variable Q: {(11, ..., qN}, we can describe an HMM by parameters
6 = {A, B, 11}. A represents the state transition matrix

A = {am}SXS

where S is the number of states and a,” represents the probability of
transition from state u to v. The initial state transition probabilities are
represented as

11:1711, ---,JTS}

We use a multivariate normal density function with full covariance matrix
as emission probability of the states. For a given genomic position j and
state u we have

170% lqj = u) =11er In“, 2“)

Where M" and 2" are respectively the D-dimensional mean vector and full

covariance matrix. Lastly, the emission parameters B are deﬁned as

{(ul, :1),  (us, 25)}.

imum likelihood parameters on a supervised approach. For a given an-
notation sequence of the hidden data Q and sample data X, the

parameters are estimated as

am = A (4)

2 :S I
w =1 auw

where 05;, = Elli/71 1(q,- = u, qiil = v) represents the number of transitions
from state u to state v observed in the training data.

As we expect the HMM to always start at the BACK state, the initial
transition vector :11 = 1 and 21,, =0 for u> 1.

Finally, the emission parameters are estimated as

The ﬁnal goal of our model is to find the most probable states visited
for a given genomic signal. More formally, we want to ﬁnd the most
probable sequence of hidden states Q having observed X given a
model 6, which can be written as

Q* = argénaXMX, Q|®) (7)

The solution to the above problem is given by the Viterbi algorithm
(Rabiner, 1989). In practical terms, we consider positions annotated
with the FOOTPRINT state to be potential active TFBSs.

3 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

3.1 Datasets

Both DNase-seq and ChIP-seq for TFs and histone modiﬁca-
tions data were obtained in ENCODE repository (ENCODE
Project Consortium, 2012). We used read alignments available
for the embryonic stem cell (Hl-hESC) and myelogenous leuke-
mia (K562). DNase-seq and ChIP-seq for H3K4me1, H3K4me3,
H3K9ac, H3K27ac and H2A.Z were downloaded for every cell
type to generate the input for the HMMs (see Supplementary
Table S22 for details on input data).

To create the evaluation dataset, we obtained all ChIP-seq
enriched regions for TFs of these two cell types in ENCODE
Analysis Working Group (AWG) data track. Also, we used
PWMs from Jaspar (Mathelier et al., 2014), Transfac (Matys
et al., 2006) and Uniproble (Robasky and Bulyk, 2011) reposi-
tories (see Supplementary Tables S237S25 for details on evalu-
ation data).

All experimental ﬁles and alignments are based on the human
genome build 37 (hg19). Chromosome Y has been removed from
all analyses.

3.2 HMM training and evaluation

To reduce the dimensionality of the data, we ﬁrst applied a peak
calling tool to ﬁnd regions with evidence of DHS and histone
modiﬁcation signals. The enriched regions of histone modiﬁca-
tions ChIP-seq data were defined using the peak-calling tool
MACS (Zhang et al., 2008). We used a P—Value of 10’5 and all
default parameters from MACS 1.4. No further filtering, such as
false discovery rate, was performed on the peaks, as we wanted a

lenient selection of candidate regions. The enriched regions of the
DHS data were deﬁned as in Boyle et al. (2011). Brieﬂy, a signal
corresponding to the estimated density of the DHS is generated
by applying F-seq software (Boyle et al., 2008) to the DNase-seq
mapped reads and background information based on alignabil-
ity, copy number and karyotype correction. A threshold is then
calculated by ﬁtting the signal to a gamma distribution and
considering the value that corresponds to a loose P—Value of
0.01. We merge all enriched regions for a given cell type and
extend them by 5000 bp in each direction. This step keeps only
376% of the genome with DHS or histone modiﬁcation evidence
for a given cell type (see Supplementary Table S5 for complete
statistics).

We selected a 10000 bp region around the promoter of the
gene RCOR3 and performed a cell type-speciﬁc manual annota-
tion with one of the 8 HMM states according to the epigenetic
grammar described in Figure 1. As one of the histones marksi
H3K4me17is known to be associated to distal enhancers, we
have additionally annotated an enhancer region. The selection of
these regions was made randomly, but we checked ENCODE
tracks for evidence that the gene RCOR3 was expressed in all
cell types analyzed and that the enhancer region was far
(>100 kb) from known genes and expressed regions.

To help the annotation of the footprints, MPBSs with all
PWMs from Jaspar, Transfac and Uniprobe datasets were de-
tected inside the training regions. We consider (active) footprints
all the signal depleted regions between two DHS peaks that over-
lap a MPBS. We trained ﬁve HMMs per cell type, one for each
histone modiﬁcation (H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K29ac and H2A.Z
with the promoter region and H3K4me1 with the enhancer
region). The regions used for training were excluded from all
further predictions. We used the Viterbi algorithm to ﬁnd the
footprint regions throughout the genome for each trained
HMM. Note that the evaluation of the HMM on the genomic
signals was performed regardless of any evidence that the regions
are distal/proximal to a gene. See Supplementary Section 3.1 for
details on training and Supplementary Tables S27S4 for the set
of parameters for the HMM trained using DHS +H3K4me3 on
Hl-hESC data.

3.3 Evaluation

3.3.] Binding evidence ChIP-seq experiments for the TFs being
tested were used as experimental evidence of binding. These are
simply the enriched regions (or peaks) based on the uniform
processing of ENCODE AWG data track. Next, we used the
de novo motif analysis from Factorbook (Wang et al., 2013) to
select the PWMs associated with the TF ChIP-seq data. We
considered only the TFs in which the top enriched motif was
present in at least 300 of the 500 top-scored ChIP-seq peaks.
We used PWMs from the Jaspar database matching those in
Factorbook. Four PWMs (ATFl, BACHl, NR2F2 and SP4)
not present in Jaspar were obtained from Transfac and
Uniprobre.

These PWMs were matched against the complete human
genome using the motif matching tool available in Biopython
(Cock et al., 2009). Initially, a regularizing value of 0.05 was
added for all nucleotides at all positions of the PWMs. We
used a false-positive rate (FPR; 1041) approach based on

dynamic programming (W ilczynski et al., 2009) to detect signiﬁ-
cant MPBSs. In this scenario, a different threshold is calculated
for each PWM by deﬁning the bit-score that corresponds to a
speciﬁc FPR in the distribution of scores of that TF’s PWM.
Note that Pique-Regi et al. (2011) used a fixed bit-score cutoff of
log2(10000) = 13.288 for all PWMs. However, we observed that
this criterion is strict, in the sense that only a few MPBSs
coincide with regions enriched with experimental ChIP-seq
data (see Supplementary Section 2.2 for discussion). Finally,
we filtered out all TFs in which <10% of ChIP-seq peaks con-
tained at least one MPBS associated. This resulted in a set of 56
TFs from K562 and 27 TFs for H1-hESC cell types (see
Supplementary Tables S237S25 for the final selection of
PWMs and TFs).

3.3.2 Gold standard and evaluation metrics To evaluate all
methods, a site-centric gold standard was proposed (Cuellar-
Partida et al., 2012). In this evaluation scheme, MPBSs with
ChIP-seq evidence (i.e. lying within 100 bp from the peak
summit) are considered ‘true’ TFBSs and all other MPBSs are
considered ‘false’ TFBSs. Then, every footprint prediction that
overlaps by at least 1 bp with a true TFBS is considered a correct
prediction (true positiveiTP), and every footprint that overlaps
with a false TFBS is considered an incorrect prediction (false
positiveiFP). Consequently, true negatives (TN) and false nega-
tives (FN) are, respectively, false and true TFBSs without over-
lapping footprint predictions. With such contingency table, we
are able to calculate the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of each
method. In Supplementary Tables S177S19, we show statistics
on the number of MPBSs, ChIP-seq peaks and combinations of
both.

To access the sensitivity TP/ (T P+ FN) versus speciﬁcity TN /
(TN -l- FP) trade-off, we created receiver operating characteristic
(ROC-like) curves [with true-negative rate (speciﬁcity) on x—axis,
instead of the traditional false-positive rate] and estimated the
area under the ROC—like curves (AUCs) as follows. For each
method, the MPBSs from the gold standard were divided into
two groups: the ones that contain at least 1 bp overlap with the
predicted sites and the ones that do not overlap. Both groups
were sorted based on the motif matching bit-score. A single list is
then obtained by combining the ranked list of predicted sites
before the ranked list of the non-predicted sites. A ROC—like
curve was evaluated based on this list, for all cell types and TFs.

3.4 Competing methods

We compared our method with Boyle method (Boyle et al.,
2011), Centipede (Pique-Regi et al., 2011), Cuellar-Partida
method (Cuellar-Partida et al., 2012) and Neph method (Neph
et al., 2012) using the evaluation methodology defined previ-
ously. Boyle and Neph methods analyses were based on
results/parameterization available in the original studies. As
Cuellar-Partida used a distinct statistical framework for PWM
detection, we performed experiments to select the cutoff criteria.
Centipede presented poor results with default parameters. We
have therefore performed a grid search strategy to detect the
best parameterization in one cell type and applied to the other
cell type. This leads to results close to an optimistic parameter-
ization, where parameter tuning was performed for each TF and

cell type combination. Note that this optimistic parameterization
is possible only with ChIP-seq for every TF tested. Moreover, the
estimated parameters from both cell types were similar (level of
shrinkage of negative binomial’s parameters was estimated as 0.0
for H1-hESC and 0.25 for K562 and level of shrinkage of multi-
nomial’s parameters was estimated as 0.75 for both cell types)
and represent a better choice of default parameters than the ones
provided by the tool. See Supplementary Section 4 for further
details on parameterization experiments for the competing meth-
ods. As we could not succeed in running the HMM-based his-
tone segmentation approach from Won et al. (2010), we adapted
our approach to use only histone modiﬁcation signals. For such,
the DNase level states were replaced by a single FOOTPRINT
state. All the steps described in Section 3.2 were performed
again using new manually annotated regions based on the new
HMM state conﬁguration. This method will be referenced as
Histone HMMs (H-HMM). All parameter tuning experiments
were performed on chromosome 1 and these regions were
excluded from the method comparison analysis. All annotations,
predictions and evaluation data are available in our Web
Supplementary Files for future benchmarking purposes.

3.5 HMM parameter selection

We have performed a set of experiments to evaluate/justify meth-
odological choices for our approach. For this, we used the gen-
omic signals of chromosome 1, which was left out of any further
analysis. First, we evaluated choices of scaling parameters: use of
global or local statistics in Equation (2) and value of the percent-
ile (96, 98 and 99%). Results indicate the advantage of local
normalization and that 98% was a good trade-off between sen-
sitivity and speciﬁcity. We have also compared the use of the
Viterbi algorithm and posterior decoding to detect the footprints.
Experimental results indicate a slight advantage of the Viterbi
algorithm, while the posterior decoding had numerical problems,
in particular genomic regions. We have also evaluated two
distinct HMM topologies. The ﬁrst alternative merges UP—
TOP—DOWN states in one to obtain a simple HMM. This
HMM has poor performance, as it does not take advantage of
the slope of the DHS/histone modiﬁcation signals. We have also
extended the original HMM topology by including transitions
from the background states directly to the DNase-level states.
This modification allows the detection of DHS peaks between
asymmetric histone modiﬁcation signals, which were evidenced
in Kundaje et al. (2012). The HMM had smaller AUC values
than the HMM model proposed here and was, therefore, not
explored. See Supplementary Section 3 for further discussion
regarding all empirical analyses on HMM parameter selection.
All HMMs were implemented using Scikit (Pedregosa et al.,
2011). All experiments were executed in 4 Xeon E7—4870 CPUs
with 10 2.4GHz cores each.

4.1 Selection of histone modiﬁcations

Given the predictions made by our method (referenced from this
point as DH-HMMPDHS -l- histone HMMs) in which different
histone modiﬁcations are used as input, it is possible to create
combined footprints. Brieﬂy, we take the union of all predictions

from any number of models and merge all overlapping foot-
prints. Then, an initial question would be the selection of the
optimal set of histone marks to be combined. We are particularly
interested in using as few marks as possible to minimize the ne-
cessity of high-throughput experiments. For such, we have eval-
uated the AUC values of all combinations (up to three) of the
ﬁve histone marks on chromosome 1. Results indicate that com-
binations with more histone marks are better than single-histone
models (see Supplementary Fig. S7 and Supplementary Table
S7). Several combinations of three marks
(H3K4me1 -l- H3K4me3 + H3K9ac, H3K4me1 + H3K4me3
+ H3K27ac, H2A.Z + H3K4mel + H3K4me3, H2A.Z +
H3K4me3 + H3K9ac and H3K4me3 + H3K9ac + H3K27ac)
were similarly good, i.e. their AUC are not signiﬁcantly lower
than any other combination). Similarly, if we consider only in-
dividual and pairs of histone marks, H3K4me1 + H3K4me3,
H3K4me3 + H3K9ac, H3K4me3 + H3K27ac, H2A.Z + H3K4
me3 and H3K4me1 -l- H3K9ac have similar AUCs. This indi-
cates that any combination of these histone marks, whenever
available, would perform equally well. We have selected the com-
binations H3K4me1 -l- H3K4me3 + H3K9ac and H3K4me1
+ H3K4me3, which we call DH-HMM(3) and DH-HMM(2),
respectively, for further analysis. We also used the same histone
modiﬁcation selection for all competing methods that use histone
modiﬁcation evidence [Cuellar(2), Cuellar(3), H-HMM(2) and
H-HMM(3)]. Moreover, we have performed this analysis for
H1-hESC and K562 cell types in separate. Despite small differ-
ences in rankings, a similar set of combinations resulted as
equally good and both H3K4me1 -l- H3K4me3 + H3K9ac and
H3K4me1 -l- H3K4me3 were among the top two combinations
in either cell. See Supplementary Section 3.5 for further
discussions.

4.2 Cell type speciﬁc versus non-cell type speciﬁc training

Next, we have analyzed if the DH-HMM models are speciﬁc for
the cell types they are trained on. In this particular test, we have
extended our datasets to include two new cell types (HeLa-S3
and HepG2) with 20 and 21 TFs, respectively (more details on
Supplementary Tables S2(LS21 and S2&S27). We have com-
pared the AUC values of the H3K4me1 -l- H3K4me3 DH-
HMM when it was trained in a particular cell type and executed
in the same cell type versus the other three cell types. A statistical
test (paired ManniWhitneinilcoxon with null hypothesis that
the distributions are equal) was performed and showed that only
in 1 of 12 comparisons the cell type-speciﬁc training had signiﬁ-
cantly superior AUC than a non-specific training (see
Supplementary Section 3.6). This indicates that the DH-HMM
models can be applied to any other cell type data with an insig-
niﬁcant loss of performance.

4.3 Method comparison

We show in Figure 2 the ROC-like curves for TFs GABPA,
C-jun, SIX5 and YYl and cell types H1-hESC and K562. All
methods analyzed provided a list of active TFBSs given a par-
ticular parameterization (see Supplementary Section 4 for de-
tails). An exception is Centipede, in which we used the model’s
posterior probability to rank sites and the suggested probability
(0.99) to select active TFBSs as performed in Pique-Regi et al.
(2011). The curves were obtained by ranking the active TFBSs
predictions in regard to the PWM bit-score. To obtain complete
curves, we also included in the end of the ranking the inactive
TFBSs (sorted by PWM bit-scores). Squares, circles and triangles
in the curve indicate the location of the rank with TFBSs

predicted to be active only. These points were used to obtain the
sensitivity and speciﬁcity of a method.

We tested the ranks of the methods for all 83 combinations of
cell types and TFs regarding AUC, sensitivity and speciﬁcity. We
used the FriedmanniNemenyi test to evaluate the statistical sig-
niﬁcance of the method’s ranks. As indicated in Table 1 and
Supplementary Table S1, HMMs based on histone modiﬁcation
only (H-HMM) had signiﬁcantly lower values for all indices.
This can be explained by the fact that the histone modification
signal, measured by ChIP-seq, contains a much lower resolution
than, for instance, the signal obtained with DNase-seq, which is
used by all other competing methods.

Boyle and Neph methods have signiﬁcantly higher speciﬁcity
values than competing methods (Table 1). We observed that,
in general, Boyle makes few predictions, resulting in few false
positives, but missing many of the true active TFBSs. For
example, from the 3020 observed active GABPA binding sites
in Hl-hESC, only 2066 (68.41%) and 2207 (73.08%) were
detected by Boyle and Neph, respectively; while Centipede
and the DH—HMM(3) predicted 2765 (91.56%) and 2892
(95.76%), respectively. Indeed, Boyle and Neph methods’

Results correspond to the absolute distances over all TFs using data from

sensitivity is signiﬁcantly lower than all other DHS-based
methods.

The Cuellar method with either two or three histone modiﬁ-
cations presented the highest sensitivity values, which were statis-
tically higher than all methods but Centipede and DH-HMM(3)
(Table 1). On the other hand, Cuellar had poor speciﬁcity values
being signiﬁcantly lower values than all DHS-based methods.
Because the number of false TFBSs is high, Cuellar usually pre-
dicts a great number of false positives. For instance, Cuellar(3)
predicts 5.63% (10051 sites) more false positives than DH-
HMM(3) on GABPA binding in H1-hESC. DH-HMM(2) and
DH-HMM(3) signiﬁcantly outperformed all other methods con-
cerning AUC values (Table 1) and were significantly better
ranked than all other methods in Friedman ranking
(Supplementary Table S1).

4.4 Spatial speciﬁcity and DHS coverage of
segmentation approaches

Next, we evaluated the spatial speciﬁcity (Wilbanks and
Facciotti, 2010), i.e. the distance of all predicted regions to the
center of their recognized active TFBSs. Note that this compari-
son is only made on segmentation-based methods (Boyle, Neph
and HMM-based methods), as site-centric methods always have
an ‘ideal’ spatial specificity because they use sequence informa-
tion. The Figure 3 shows the resulting distribution of distances
for all evaluated TFs. Overall, DH-HMMs had better spatial
speciﬁcity (lowest distance of footprints to the center of active
TFBSs) than all other methods (ManniWhitneinilcoxon of
equal distance distributions was rejected with P 5 1075). On
the other hand, the H-HMMs presented large distances than
all other methods (P 5 1075). This is again explained by the
lower resolution of the ChIP-seq to indicate chromatin structure
in comparison with the DHS signal. These results indicate that
DH-HMMs improve Boyle and Neph methods on the detection
of the exact location of TFBSs. Lastly, we evaluated footprints
statistics inside DHS sites. Footprints from DH—HMM cover

98.67% of DHS sites, while footprints predicted by Boyle and
Neph method cover only 30.34 and 45.22% of DHS sites. An
inspection of the DNase-seq read coverage indicates that both
Boyle and Neph methods fail to identify footprints in DHS sites
with low to average read counts. See Supplementary Section 3.8
for further details.

5 DISCUSSION

Methods for detection of active TFBSs can be categorized in two
main classes: site-centric (Cuellar and Centipede) and segmenta-
tion-based (Boyle, Neph and HMMs). Site-centric approaches
require the identiﬁcation of all MPBSs of a given TF to classify
them as active or inactive. One advantage of the latter methods is
that they have an ideal spatial speciﬁcity. On the other hand,
they require sequence binding afﬁnity information (PWM) of the
TFs to be known a priori. On the other hand, segmentation-
based approaches can be used for de novo motif detection.
Previous studies have shown that footprints allowed the auto-
matic creation of high-sensitivity TF models (Kulakovskiy et al.,
2009) and the discovery of hundreds of novel motifs (Neph et al.,
2012). Such studies would beneﬁt from segmentation-based
methods with good spatial speciﬁcity. Moreover, segmentation-
based methods tend to reduce computational complexity, as they
decrease drastically (172%) the genomic space used for motif
detection. However, it is important to mention that the interpret-
ation of such reduced genomic space would still require know-
ledge of proteins’ binding sequence afﬁnity.

While Centipede obtained good AUC results, the method’s
performance was too dependent on regularization parameters.
Moreover, for large input ﬁles (TFs with a large number of
PWM hits) the method required up to 6 days/core of computing
and 65 GB of memory on a single TF and cellular condition. The
most computational expensive segmentation method, DH-
HMM, requires 9 days/core for predicting footprints and
active binding sites over all 500 TFs from JASPAR in one cell
type.

Another important aspect is the proposed combined use of
DHS and histone modiﬁcations shapes around the TFBSs.
Cuellar method is based on obtaining read counts around the
TFBSs. Clearly, such method cannot take the local shape proﬁles
into account. For example, it cannot distinguish the DHS peaks
with the footprint signals and would detect any TFBS inside a
region with high DHS levels as the regions indicated in
Figure 1A. Our experimental results conﬁrm the poor specificity
of the method. While Centipede used the local proﬁles of the
DHS signal, it used simple read count statistics for the histone
modiﬁcation signals. Therefore, it is unable to detect the valley
shapes indicated in Figure 1A. Not surprisingly, no improve-
ments were possible with the use of histone modiﬁcations using
Centipede, as indicated in Pique-Regi et al. (2011). The DH-
HMM model could show improved results by using the local
profiles of DHS and histone modiﬁcation signals. Moreover,
DH-HMM footprints cover a higher percentage of DHS regions
than other segmentation-based methods.

Recent studies have also indicated that the histone modiﬁca-
tion profiles centered on DHS sites can be clustered and these
clusters can also have asymmetric shapes, where there is lower
evidence of histone marks downstream or upstream of the DHS.

We have also tested variants of the DH-HMM to capture such
asymmetric signals, but no signiﬁcant improvement was ob-
tained. As show in Supplementary Figure S5, the slope signals
have high values changes even on low histone modification
values and are responsible for the correct characterization of
such asymmetric peaks. Lastly, the HMMs displayed robustness
in the training/evaluation on distinct cell types. This indicates
that no further training of the HMMs and time intensive
manual annotation of genomic regions are required. This is
achieved by addressing both within- and between-dataset vari-
ability with our normalization pipeline.

6 FINAL REMARKS

This article presents a novel approach to combine the spatial
proﬁles of DHS (DNase-seq) and histone modifications (ChIP-
seq) to predict cell type-specific active TFBSs. Moreover, we
perform a large evaluation of all competing methods over two
cell types and a large validation with 83 TF ChIP-seq datasets.
We could show that the HMM model combining both DHS and
histone modiﬁcation data presents a good trade-off between sen-
sitivity and specificity in relation to all compared methods.
Furthermore, the method was robust when trained and evaluated
in distinct cell types and has no further parameterization require-
ments. This study also provides all footprint predictions and
validation data forming the first benchmarking dataset for foot-
printing analyses. The accumulation of further epigenetic data
and more detailed biological experiments will pose new meth-
odological challenges to the ﬁeld. The analysis of a cell type
after a differentiation steps or response stimuli would indicate
detailed changes in transcriptional landscape.

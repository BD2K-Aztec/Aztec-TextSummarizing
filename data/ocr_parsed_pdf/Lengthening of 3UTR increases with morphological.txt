ABSTRACT

Motivation: Evolutionary expansion of gene regulatory circuits seems
to boost morphological complexity. However, the expansion patterns
and the quantification relationships have not yet been identified. In this
study, we focus on the regulatory circuits at the post-transcriptional
level, investigating whether and how this principle may apply.
Results: By analysing the structure of mRNA transcripts in multiple
metazoan species, we observed a striking exponential correlation be-
tween the Iength of 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTR) and morphological
complexity as measured by the number of cell types in each organism.
Cellular diversity was similarly associated with the accumulation of
microRNA genes and their putative targets. We propose that the
lengthening of 3’UTRs together with a commensurate exponential ex-
pansion in post-transcriptional regulatory circuits can contribute to the
emergence of new cell types during animal evolution.

1 INTRODUCTION

For the past decade of genome exploration, research into the
evolution of organismal diversity and morphological complexity
has shifted its focus from raw genome size to gene regulatory
complexity (Carroll, 2001; Vogel and Chothia, 2006; Tan et al.,
2009). Multicellular organisms may contain a variety of widely
differing and specialized cell types. The morphological complex-
ity, thus, can be deﬁned as the number of distinct cell types
within a species (Valentine et al., 1994; Vogel and Chothia,
2006). Generation of new cell types may require exploring and
reshaping the expression landscape that relies on expansion or
rewiring of extant regulatory circuits, leading to a variety of
cell-speciﬁc expression patterns. Complex gene regulatory cir-
cuits may allow a greater variety of potential combinations of
gene expression, thereby facilitating the generation of novel cell
types. This principle has been studied mainly at the transcrip-
tional level, that is, the regulatory circuits of transcription factors
(TFs) and corresponding cis—regulatory elements on DNA
(Carroll, 2001). However, recent studies have shown that the

post-transcriptional gene regulation is believed to be widespread
(Bartel, 2009; De Mulder and Berezikov, 2010; Ji et al., 2009).
Also, extensive co-regulation and crosstalk between the tran-
scriptional and the post-transcriptional levels have been sug-
gested (Chen et al., 2011; Cui et al., 2007; Hobert, 2008; Lin
et al., 2012). Thus, it is of great interest to examine whether
and to what extent this principle may also apply at the
post-transcriptional level.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Collection of mature mRNA transcripts

Mature mRNA transcript and untranslated region (UTR) sequences were
downloaded from RefGene table through UCSC Genome Browser
(Rhead et al., 2010) and from UTRdb (Grillo et al., 2010). Fifteen or-
ganisms, for which the 5’ and 3’UTRs of mature mRNA transcripts have
been well characterized and annotated (RefSeq), were used in this study,
Caenorhabditis elegans, Apis mellifera (honey bee), Anopheles gambiae,
Drosophila melanogaster (fruit ﬂy), C iona intestinalis, Danio rerio (zebra-
flsh), Takifugu rubripes (Fugu rubripes), X enopus tropicalis (western
clawed frog), Gallus gallus (chicken), Cam's familiaris (dog), Bos taurus
(cattle), Rattus norvegicus (Norway rat), Mus musculus (house mouse),
Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee) and Homo sapiens (human). S accharom yces
cerevisiae (yeast) transcript data, derived from RNA sequencing, were
referenced from Nagalakshmi et a]. (2008). A common set of orthologous
genes were selected from NCBI’s HomoloGene database (Supplementary
Methods). Regression analysis was performed to study the relationships
between the region length and the organismal complexity (Fig. 1A and
Supplementary Fig. S1) based on four different models, linear, exponen-
tial, logarithm and power models (Supplementary Methods). The expo-
nential model gave the best performance in most cases and was reported
thereinafter.

2.2 Putative TFs and microRNA genes in organisms

The number of predicted TFs was obtained from the DBD 2.0. These
putative TFs all contain sequence-speciﬁc DNA-binding domains
(Wilson et al., 2008). The number of microRNA (miRNA) genes that
have been identiﬁed in each organism was derived from miRBase release
18 (Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2008). Seventeen metazoan species that have
reported miRNA genes were used in this study, Caenorhabditis briggsae,
C .elegans, A.gambiae, A.mellifera, D.melanogaster, Cintestinalis, D.rerio,
T.rubripes, Tetradon nigroviridis, X .tropicalis, G.gallus, Cfamiliaris,
B.taurus, R.norvegicus, M .musculus, P.troglodytes and H .sapiens
(Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S2).

from (A) for comparison

2.3 Complexity of miRNA regulation on target genes

The putative miRNA binding sites among target genes were obtained
from MicroCosm Targets 5 (formerly miRBase Targets) (Grifﬁths-
Jones et al., 2008), TargetScan 5.1 (Friedman et al., 2009) and RNA22
(Miranda et al., 2006). In the TargetScan and RNA22 databases, predic-
tions were only available for worm (Celegans), ﬂy (D.melanogaster),
mouse (M .musculus) and human (H.sapiens), whereas predictions for 15
species were available in the MicroCosm database (Supplementary Fig.
S3). The miRNA binding complexity for each organism was deﬁned as
the average numbers of putative binding miRNAs per target gene.
Although the three databases used different algorithms to predict

miRNA binding sites (Bartel, 2009), their results still displayed a close
correlation between miRNA binding complexity and morphological com-
plexity (Fig. 1C).

2.4 Functional annotation

Organism functional annotation categorized by Gene Ontology (G0) was
obtained from UniProtKB (Magrane and Consortium, 2011) and
DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (Huang et al., 2009). Typical
GO categories of miRNA targets and anti-targets were according to
Stark et a]. (2005).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

After analysing the structure of genomic mRNA transcripts from
a variety of multicellular animals, we observed a striking expo-
nential correlation (Pearson’s r: 0.88, P: 1.69 x 10—5) between
the typical length of the 3/UTR and morphological complexity as
measured by the number of cell types (Fig. 1A). Conversely,
there was no signiﬁcant correlation observed between morpho-
logical complexity and S/UTR length (Supplementary Fig. Sla)
or coding sequence length (Supplementary Fig. Slb).

Considering the possibility that the observed variations in the
3’UTR length could be merely because of the implications of
gene gain and loss in evolution, we selected a common set of
orthologous genes among these organisms and repeated the same
analysis on these new subjects, obtaining a similar pattern
(Supplementary Fig. S4) as shown before, which indicates that
the exponential lengthening of 3/UTR can be observed not only
in a genome-wide scale but also in the broadly conserved gene
subset.

As animal miRNAs mainly target the cis—regulatory elements
in 3/UTR, this difference may be because of miRNA-based
post-transcriptional regulation (Mazumder et al., 2003).
Indeed, miRNAs have been suggested as a practical phylogenetic
marker for metazoa (Kosik, 2009; Wheeler et al., 2009). Recent
studies also showed that miRNAs play a crucial role in the evo-
lution of 3’UTR and the establishment of tissue identity (De
Mulder and Berezikov, 2010; Farh et al., 2005; Kosik, 2009;
Shkumatava et al., 2009; Stark et al., 2005). The likelihood
that a transcript will be targeted by miRNA may increase with
3’UTR length because 3’UTR expansion can yield additional
miRNA binding sites (Ji et al., 2009; Supplementary Figs SS
and S6). Furthermore, longer 3/UTRs may include multiple
polyadenylation signals, and thus produce several alternative
transcript isoforms with different combinations of miRNA bind-
ing sites, leading to a large increase in regulatory complexity
(Ji et al., 2009; Majoros and Ohler, 2007; Mangone et al.,
2010). Ji et al. (2009) also reported the observation of progressive
lengthening of 3/UTR during mouse embryonic development,
together suggesting that lengthening of 3’UTR may play essential
roles in both evolution and developmental processes.

The number of miRNA genes in the genome was also found to
grow exponentially with morphological complexity (Pearson’s
r=0.68, P=2.79 x 10—3; Fig. 1B). The co-expansion of trans-
regulators (miRNA genes) and potential cis—elements (length of
3/UTR) suggests a possible evolutionary increase in the complex-
ity of post-transcriptional regulation. Indeed, we found that the
miRNA binding complexity in 3/UTR, as predicted by different
algorithms, also strongly correlated with morphological com-
plexity (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S3).

In addition, the typical miRNA target and anti-target cate-
gories have a clear divergence in 3/UTR length patterns
(Fig. 1D). Transcriptional regulation genes, known as a typical
class of miRNA targets (Enright et al., 2003; Stark et al., 2005),
grew exponentially in 3’UTR length as organismal complexity
increased (Pearson’s r = 0.71, P = 3.07 x 10—3). In sharp contrast
to this, ribosomal genes, a class of housekeeping genes and
miRNA anti-targets (Stark et al., 2005), had relatively short
3/UTRs in all model organisms and no signiﬁcant correlation.
These results reinforce the argument that the lengthening of

3/UTR is highly associated with the expansion of miRNA regu-
latory programs.

Previous research has shown that the metazoan genome is
continuously acquiring novel miRNA families (Chen and
Rajewsky, 2007; Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2008; Kosik, 2009). A
novel miRNA would have an initially genome-wide stochastic
regulatory effect on all potential targets, and then the natural
selection drives the preservation or avoidance of these miRNA
binding sites (Chen and Rajewsky, 2007). On the other hand, the
increase in 3/UTR length could be an effective strategy to sto-
chastically accommodate more miRNA binding sites in 3/UTR
and boost the complexity of miRNA regulation combinations,
thus expanding the expression space for natural selection to ex-
plore. The selection process may ﬁnally result in a cross-the-
board lengthening for 3/UTR, but still with some ﬂexibility.
For example, housekeeping genes tend to avoid miRNA binding
sites and maintain their 3/UTR length relatively short, so that
they may perform their household tasks without unneeded inter-
ference (Stark et al., 2005).

Although the association between 3/UTR lengthening and
increasing of miRNA regulatory complexity could be observed
within and across multiple species (Supplementary Figs SS and
S6), the causeieffect relationship between the two factors is still
in a tangle, unless the temporal precedence could be ﬁrstly
demonstrated by comprehensive genome and transcriptome re-
construction of the last common ancestors in the phylogenic trees
of animals. We suspect that the expansion of miRNA regulatory
circuits may provide additional advantages for organisms, such
as strengthening the gene expression buffering and
anti-ﬂuctuation ability (Li et al., 2009; Stark et al., 2005),
which in turn help the organisms to explore their genotype
space in races with other species or environment changes.
However, the possibility of opposite direction of selection force
cannot be ruled out; in other words, some undiscovered factors
that directly promote the 3’UTR lengthening along with increas-
ing miRNA binding sites as its side effect could exist beyond our
knowledge.

A similar exponential correlation of morphological complexity
was demonstrated in the number of TFs (Pearson’s r=0.70,
P: 1.81 x 10—3; Supplementary Fig. S2). This suggests that the
expansion of gene regulators occurred and co-evolved at both the
transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Indeed, the gene
regulatory circuits at both levels were found highly analogous
and extensively cross-wired to each other, allowing for even more
complicated regulation of cellular processes and homeostasis
(Cui et al., 2007; Hobert, 2008; Lin et al., 2012). Given the role
of miRNAs in stabilizing gene expression and conferring robust-
ness to gene regulatory networks (De Mulder and Berezikov,
2010; Homstein and Shomron, 2006; Li et al., 2009; Stark
et al., 2005; Tsang et al., 2007), miRNAs are likely to play an
important role in establishing stable expression landscapes and
maintaining tissue identities in cooperation with TFs, together
contributing to increase of morphological complexity.

Interestingly, all the regulation-related variables (L) examined
earlier in the text showed similar exponential growth against the
number of cell types (It):

Lengthening of 3’UTR increases with morphological complexity

 

or equivalently:
dL/dn ~ (IL (2)

with a factor a ranging from 0.01 to 0.016 (Fig. lAeD). It indi-
cated that the generation of a new cell type involves an ~1%
increase in regulatory complexity. This also implied that the cost
of generating a new cell type was ~1% additional redundancy in
the regulatory circuits. The redundancy may provide robustness
and have the ability to accumulate variation to explore new
genotype space, leading to evolutionary innovations (Wagner,
2011).

The emergence of morphological complexity seems to have its
multi-ori gins and different evolutionary paths in many aspects of
cellular processes and molecular systems. For example, in add-
ition to the expansion of TF/miRNA regulatory networks, cell
signalling networks also play a role in promoting organismal
complexity (Li et al, 2012). On the other hand, regulatory elem-
ents in S’UTR do not seem to be a critical factor to the increased
organismal complexity in metazoan (Chen et al, 2012). It is of
great interest to elucidate what factors and to what extents these
factors contributed to the increased morphological complexity.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Our ﬁndings align with recent studies showing that protein
domain recombination and cis—regulatory element recombination
may also have a major role in evolution (Paixao and Azevedo,
2010; Peisajovich et al, 2010). As gene duplication and recom-
bination are combinatorial processes that rely on existing genetic
materials (Olson, 2006), it follows the principle ‘complexity will
breed complexity’, leading to a non-linear expansion in post-
transcriptional interactions. Based on our empirical evidence of
a strong exponential trend between the development of new cell
types and the expansion of post-transcriptional regulatory cir-
cuits, we, therefore, propose that 3’UTR lengthening can con-
tribute to greater morphological complexity in animals, and this
process was driven by natural selection.

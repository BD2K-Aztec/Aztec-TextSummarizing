39 samples for the MYCN ampliﬁed (MNA) and MYCN single
copy (MNSC) group, respectively. We refer to the
uniﬁedWMWqPCR vignette for more information. Following
De Neve et a]. (2013), we assess null hypothesis (2) using all
features for estimating A as follows:

number of features: 323

Fitted probabilities: P(MNA < MNSC) + 0.5 P(MNA = MNSC)

Estimated log odds ratio’s (logor), corresponding standard
errors (se), odds ratio’s (or), test statistics and P—values can be
extracted as follows:

> uWMW.out[names(uWMW.out)l

logor se or z.value p.value
hsa-let-7a 0.7824254 0.3086131 2.186770 2.535296 0.011235249
hsa-let-7b 0.9308019 0.3219984 2.536542 2.890703 0.003843808

The estimated log OR(C§’INA < Cg/INSC) for hsa—let—7a is
given by 0.78, and it is signiﬁcantly different from 0 at the 5%
level of significance. The p.adjust function (R, 2013) can be used
to adjust the P—values for multiple testing.

For visualization, the function forestplot can be used to draw
a forest plot of a selection of microRNAs; see Figure 1. The
estimated probabilities in (1) as well as their (unadjusted) 95%
conﬁdence intervals are plotted. The diamond on the bottom
gives the estimate and conﬁdence interval of A with which the
probabilities should be compared with.

As the uWMW test is in essence obtained by ﬁtting a prob—
abilistic index model (Thas et al., 2012), the estimated coefﬁcients
of the model and the estimated varianceicovariance matrix can
also be extracted.

2.3 Performance

As the uWMW test implies fitting a regression model to a dataset
with nlnzN rows and N columns (where N is the total number of
features and n,- the number of samples in group 1'), its efﬁcient
implementation is an important property of the package.
Analyzing a small dataset of 20 features with 10 replicates for
each treatment group takes <0.2 s, whereas a large dataset of
1000 features with 100 replicates for each treatment group
takes <30 s on an Intel 2.5 GHz CPU with 4 GB RAM.

3 CONCLUSION

This article presents the Bioconductor uniﬁedWMWqPCR pack—
age. It provides an extension of the WMW test so that a separate
normalization preprocessing step is no longer required before as—
sessing differential expression. In addition to P—values, the pack—
age also provides informative plots to visualize treatment effects.

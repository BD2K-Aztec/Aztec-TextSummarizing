ABSTRACT

Motivation: Tremendous amount of omics data being accumulated
poses a pressing challenge of meta-analyzing the heterogeneous data
for mining new biological knowledge. Most existing methods deal with
each gene independently, thus often resulting in high false positive
rates in detecting differentially expressed genes (DEG). To our know-
ledge, no or little effort has been devoted to methods that consider
dependence structures underlying transcriptomics data for DEG iden-
tification in meta-analysis context.

Results: This article proposes a new meta-analysis method for iden-
tification of DEGs based on joint non-negative matrix factorization
(iNMFMA). We mathematically extend non-negative matrix factoriza-
tion (NMF) to a joint version (iNMF), which is used to simultaneously
decompose multiple transcriptomics data matrices into one common
submatrix plus multiple individual submatrices. By the jNMF, the
dependence structures underlying transcriptomics data can be inter-
rogated and utilized, while the high-dimensional transcriptomics data
are mapped into a low-dimensional space spanned by metagenes that
represent hidden biological signals. jNMFMA finally identifies DEGs as
genes that are associated with differentially expressed metagenes.
The ability of extracting dependence structures makes jNMFMA
more efficient and robust to identify DEGs in meta-analysis context.
Furthermore, jNMFMA is also flexible to identify DEGs that are
consistent among various types of omics data, e.g. gene expression
and DNA methylation. Experimental results on both simulation data
and real -world cancer data demonstrate the effectiveness of jNMFMA
and its superior performance over other popular approaches.

1 INTRODUCTION

As high throughput biotechnologies have become routine tools
in biological and biomedical researches, tremendous amounts of
omics data have been generated that provide great opportunity
for deciphering molecular mechanisms of cancer or other

diseases (Jiao et al., 2014; Natrajan and Wilkerson, 2013;
TCGA, 2012; Zhang et al., 2013). Two famous public gene ex-
pression databases, GEO (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and
ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/), have deposited
transcriptomic data with more than a million assays from
more than 30 000 studies. Another valuable resource, the
TCGA project (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/), has released vari-
ous types of omics data for nearly 10 000 cancer patient samples.
Reusing the ﬂood of transcriptomics data with meta-analysis can
reduce sample bias and increase statistical power, and thus allow
for indepth understanding of pathology of cancer or other dis-
eases at molecular level (Rung and Brazma, 2013). However, the
key issue of meta-analysis, i.e. capturing consistent but subtle
patterns of gene activity across multiple transcriptomics datasets,
still remains challenging both theoretically and practically.
Differentially expressed genes (DEG) across studies could
reﬂect subtle but consistent biological effects and might
be false negatives in individual analysis 0(ia et al., 2013).
To efﬁciently identify DEGs, meta-analysis methods need to
overcome a variety of biological or non-biological variations
introduced by distinct protocols and data platforms used in
individual studies (Rung and Brazma, 2013). From the aspect
of information to be combined, existing meta-analysis methods
can be categorized into three classes: P-Value-based, effect
size-based and rank-based, which each deal with non-speciﬁc
variations at different levels of data. Among them, the P—Value-
based method is statistically most intuitive but allows for
standardization of topic-related associations from studies to the
common scale of signiﬁcance (Li and Tseng, 2011). However,
the performance of P value-based methods heavily depends on
the underlying method used for P value calculation in individual
analysis (Tseng et al., 2012). Compared with P value-based meth-
ods, the effect size-based methods estimate and directly synthe-
size effect sizes across studies by using a t—statistic—like model.
Because the effect size quantity provides a direct measure of
differential expression, effect size methods tend to be more efﬁ-
cient in detecting DEGs than the P value-based methods (Hong
and Breitling, 2008). There are two types of effect size models
that can be used for meta-analysis of transcriptomics data:
fixed-effect model (FEM) and random effect model (REM),
which differ in whether between-study variation is ignorable.
Generally, effect size-based methods suffer from unreliable
error estimates due to improper distribution assumption

and large noise inherent in microarray data (Hong and Breitling,
2008). Comparatively, the rank-based methods combine the
ranks of fold-change, instead of expression values as in effect
size models and have an advantage of fewer or no assumptions
about data structures (Breitling and Herzyk, 2005). These two
features make the rank-based methods more robust and outlier-
free in ranking and assessing genes 0(ia et al., 2013). A repre-
sentative rank-based method is the RankProd method, proposed
by Hong et a]. (2006), which has been extensively demonstrated
to be more reliable and robust than many other methods, espe-
cially in low sample number and/or large noise settings (Chang
et al., 2013; Hong and Breitling, 2008).

Statistical hypothesis about variations of differential expres-
sion is another non-trivial factor in meta-analysis. Two comple-
mentary hypotheses are generally assumed behind meta-analysis
methods: one (HSa) assuming that DEGs are differentially
expressed (DE) in all the studies and the other (HSb) assuming
that DEGs are DE in one or more studies. The former is more
desirable when all the studies are homogeneous, while the latter
is more useful and efﬁcient when heterogeneity is expected across
datasets. To reconcile the two complementary hypotheses, Song
and Tseng (2014) recently presented a new type of hypothesis,
HSr, which allows users to specify in what fraction of studies
genes are expected to be DE.

It is well-known that gene correlations are ubiquitous in
transcriptomics data and can exert substantial impact on the
performance of microarray data analysis (Wang et al., 2011).
Without exception, the dependence structures also considerably
inﬂuence the meta-analysis of multiple transcriptomics datasets
and need to be dealt with carefully (Choi et al., 2003). To our
knowledge, no or little effort has been devoted to the data
dependency issue in meta-analysis of transcriptomics data.
Generally, the dependency can be addressed by transforming
the high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional space. In com-
puter science, many dimensional reduction or projection
methods (Gan et al., 2014; Gaujoux and Seoighe, 2012; Zeng
et al., 2008) can be used for the task. For example, Le Cao
et a]. applied canonical correlation (CC) analysis to pursuit
low-dimensional projections that maximize the associations
between two omics variables (Le Cao et al., 2009). Other
researchers proposed to use coinertia analyses to explore the
relationships between two different types of omics datasets
(Fagan et al., 2007; Jeffery et al., 2007).

Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a recently
developed projection method, originally proposed for learning
natural parts of faces or semantic features of text (Lee and
Seung, 1999). Under the constraint of non-negativity, NMF
speciﬁcally factorizes data matrix to recover natural parts that
are integral to the whole. It has been shown that NMF and its
sparse versions perform well in microarray data analysis for
pattern discovery and classiﬁcation (Brunet et al., 2004; Kim
and Park, 2007; Zhang et al., 2012; Zheng et al., 2011).

In this study, we propose a joint NMF transcriptomics data
meta-analysis method (jNMFMA) for DEG identiﬁcation.
Biologically, a certain number of independent biological signals
underlie a phenotype and collectively shape gene activities that
are associated with the phenotype. Relative to real gene entity,
these biological signals can be referred to as metagenes. One
metagene might dominate the expression of a group of genes

and account for the dependence structures between these
genes. In return, we can recover these metagenes from tran-
scriptomics data and identify DEGs by associating them with
metagenes that are responsible for the phenotype. Following
this, this article develops a joint NMF algorithm (jNMF) to
simultaneously decompose multiple transcriptomics datasets
into a low-dimensional space spanned by metagenes. Then,
we employ a regulation probability model to extract DE
metagenes and formulate a new metagene-based statistic for
measuring differential expression of a gene in meta-analysis
context. In summary, jNMFMA can interrogate gene correl-
ations in a joint-decomposition way for efﬁcient meta-analysis
of transcriptomics data. The use of metagenes as an intermedi-
ate step also makes jNMFMA ﬂexible in identifying various
types of DEGs by conﬁning metagenes. For example,
jNMFMA can be used to meta-analyze transcriptomics data
and DNA methylation data of a same or similar topic for
identifying methylation-driven DEGs (as shown in Results
section). Compared with other dimensional reduction methods,
jNMFMA, as an extension of NMF, derives a parts-based
representation, favors a sparse matrix decomposition and
thus is more suitable to analyze large-scale omics data that
are sparse in nature.

To evaluate the performance of jNMFMA, we first applied
it to simulation data, where jNMFMA successfully identiﬁed
DEGs with high accuracies. Considering that lung cancer is
one of the most malignant tumors worldwide, jNMFMA was
then employed to identify gene signatures for lung adenocar-
cinoma (LUAD) based on real-world gene expression and
methylation data collected from GEO database. In addition,
we downloaded from TCGA (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/)
another two expression and methylation datasets of LUAD
as independent evaluation datasets. The results on both simu-
lation and real-world cancer data show that jNMFMA is able
to efficiently identify DEGs with biological significance and
outperforms other popular approaches.

2 METHODS

Given two or more microarray datasets X ,- consisting of same genes,
jNMFMA ﬁrst jointly factorizes them into a common submatrix W for
all the datasets, named loading coefﬁcient matrix (LCM), plus individual
submatrix H,- for data set i, named metagene matrix (MGM), as shown in
Figure 1A. All the H,- can be horizontally stacked to form an overall
metagene matrix H, each row corresponding to a metagene that repre-
sents a hidden biological signal behind the datasets, as shown in Figure
1B. Each row of W reﬂects the relationships of a gene with the metagenes
that hold in all the data. In other worlds, all the data X,- are a result driven
by the hidden metagenes and represent as a linear combination by the
common loading coefﬁcients in W. We use H(H,-) to identify DE
metagenes that are associated with a phenotype of interest, as shown in
Figure 1B, and then DEGs as genes that are associated with DE
metagenes based on W.

2.1 Mathematics of joint non-negative matrix
factorization (iNMF)

Assume S datasets X ,-, i = 1, 2, . . . , S, with G common genes to be meta-
analyzed. Let xg, be the expression level of gene g in sample j, the ith
data set be denoted by X,- = {xgﬁg = 1, 2, . . . ,G,j = 1, 2,. . . , n,}, where
n,- is the number of samples in the dataset. JNMF pursues a

where W is the sub-matrix LCM of size G x k (k is an integer constant),
H,- is the sub-matrix MGM of size k x n,- for dataset i, and E,- represents
an error matrix for dataset i for accommodating data heterogeneity and
noise. Biologically, the decomposition means to recover k hidden bio-
logical signals (metagenes) behind the datasets. Mathematically, the de-
composition can be formulated as an optimization problem:

Because the objective function is not convex on both W and H to-
gether, no standard algorithm exists for an immediate solution of
Equation (2). Practically, it is desirable to ﬁnd local minima for such
optimization problems. In this article, we develop a two-stage multi-
plicative updating algorithm (see Supplementary Material) for solving
Equation (2). A proof for the convergence of the optimization algo-
rithm is given in Supplementary Material.

2.2 Identiﬁcation of DEGs

We deﬁne two events of gene regulation: upregulation (UR) event and
downregulation (DR) event in treatment (7) relative to control (C).
Following the regulation probability model (RPM) (Wang and Huang,
2006), the difference between probabilities of events UR and DR for each
metagene, referred to as absolute regulation probability (ARP), is calcu-
lated based on H,- and is used to select DE metagenes. This results in two
types of DE metagenes: uMG, in which metagenes are upregulated in T
relative to C for all Hi, and dMG, in which metagenes are downregulated
in T relative to C for all H,-. These DE metagenes potentially represent
two types of hidden biological signals that are responsible for the distinc-
tion between T and C. Considering that each gene can be viewed as a
linear combination of the metagenes weighted by row of W (Equation
(1)), we formulate the following statistic to measure the differential ex-
pression of a gene:

S

d: E ajo— Z ajo,aj=Z%P,j 

jEuMG jEdMG i= 1

where  is the ARP of DE metagenej estimated by RPM from H,- and n
is the total number of samples in the datasets. The two terms at the right

side of Equation (3) represent the weighted contributions of uMG and
dM G to the expression of the gene, respectively. Since some metagenes
are more discriminative of sample classiﬁcation than others, we weight
their contributions using a quantity of or, calculated by the ARP and data
conﬁdences (ni/n) of each dataset. Larger difference between the two
contributions means a higher likelihood that the gene is differentially
expressed in T relative to C. The sign of d indicates the regulation
direction.

2.3 Signiﬁcance estimation

We employ a permutation test to estimate the signiﬁcance of DEGs. A
critical step in the permutation test is to calculate permuted ds that are
required to sample from null hypothesis. One possible way for this may
be to randomly shufﬂe sample labels in the original datasets and rerun
jNMFMA. However, this is computationally infeasible for 1000 or more
replicates in permutation test setting. Alternatively, we deﬁne the null
hypothesis as one that W matrix is non-discriminative of the sample
classiﬁcation, and then randomly shufﬂe the elements of W B = 1000
times for calculating B permutated ds. Let d; be the permuted d for
gene m in the bth permutation, the P value for an observed d can be
calculated as

1 B G
p= 52) Z) 1(ldl<ldm"l) (4)
b=1m=1
where I(>) is an indicator function, yielding 1 if the condition is true and 0
otherwise.

2.4 Meta-analysis of gene expression data and DNA
methylation data

jNMFMA can also meta-analyze transcriptomics data and DNA methy-
lation data with common gene entities for identifying DEGs with nega-
tively correlated expression and methylation patterns (mDEG). For such
mDEGs, the differential expression may be dominantly driven by its own
altered methylation status. This is useful to detect methylation-driven
cancer driver genes as deﬁned in (Bock and Lengauer, 2008; Das and
Singal, 2004). To this end, we consider two alternative molecular events,
one is simultaneous hypomethylation and upregulation in T relative to C
and another simultaneous hypermethylation and downregulation in T
relative to C. With the two alternative molecular events, another two
types of metagenes can be extracted using RPM: umM G, in which
metagenes are hypomethylated and upregulated in T relative to C, and
de G, in which metagenes are hypermethylated and downregulated in

T relative to C. Similar to Equation (3), we formulate the following
statistic to identify mDEGs:

S

d: E ajo— Z ajo,aj=Z%P,j 

jEumMG jEdeG i= 1

and create a permutation test similar to that in Section 2.3 for estimating
the signiﬁcance of mDEGs.

2.5 Simulation data generation

We generated Simulation Data I by revising the procedure in (Wang
et al., 2011). Assume two studies, I and II, and that samples in each
study come from condition A (n) or B (n). Total G = 900 simulation
genes are divided into nine groups, each group containing 100 genes
whose expression follows a same regulation mode, as shown in
Supplementary Table S1. Of these groups, G1 is upregulated in A relative
to B in both studies and G2 is downregulated in A relative to B in both
studies, which both are target DEGs to identify in the experiment.
The ‘expression’ data in each study were synthesized as follows: First, a
correlation background matrix X [G x 2n] was generated as hidden
dependence structures by (i) randomly selecting clump size m from
{1, 2, 3, . . . , 100} and clump-wise correlation p from a uniform distribu-
tion U(0.S, 1). For a given (m,p) pair, we (ii) generated noise vectors e.) of
dimension m x 1 from a multivariate normal distribution
N(0m,(17p)Im -l- plml’m) for sample j and (iii) set x.,~: p. -l- diag(w)e.,~,
where p. and a) are an mxl vector of elements ng~1000)(§ and of
elements cog = eﬁO/anl/Z (,80 and ,8] are two constants) respectively,
and diag is a diagonalization function, as the background expression
values of the m genes in the clump at samples j = 1, 2, . . . , 2n. In the
experiment, we set ,80 = 75 and ,8] = 2. Then, based on the correlation
background, for the ﬁrst eight groups, we added (or subtracted) a term
2'0'58gwg, 8g ~ U(S,10), to (from) the samples in condition B according to
the regulation modes (Supplementary Table S1) as ﬁnal expression levels,
and left the background as ﬁnal expression levels for the ninth group.
The true expression ratios for the ﬁrst eight groups are
1 +2’1/2eﬁ0/28g~U(1.29, 1.58). To examine the effect of sample size, we
varied n among {6, 20, 50, 100, 200} to generate six simulation data
scenarios.

Simulation data 11 were designed to mimic hidden biological signals.
Assume G = 600 genes and that their expression is a linear combination
of six hidden biological signals. Of the six hidden biological signals, two
are assumed to be true DE signals and four noise signals. Similar to
Simulation Data 1, we assumed two studies and that samples in each
study belong to condition A (n) or B (n). The two true DE signals were
simulated by equations h],- = S.1(6.1) -l- |8| in sample 1' of condition A (B)
and h2,- = S.3(4.3) -l- |8| in sample 1' of condition A (B), respectively. 8 was
randomly sampled as noise from a normal distribution N(0,0.S). The four
noise signals are divided into two types: discordant DE signals, which are
differentially expressed but have discordant differential expression pat-
terns in the two studies, and non-DE signals, which are not differentially
expressed in any study at all. The former two noise signals were synthe-
sized as discordant DE signals by equations h3,- = S.2(6.2) -l- |8| in sample
1' of condition A (B) in one study and h3,- = 6.2(S.2) -l- |8| in sample 1' of
condition A (B) in another study, or by equations h4,- = S.4(4.4) -l- |8| in
sample 1' of condition A (B) in one study and h4,- 4.4(S.4) -l- |8| in sample 1'
of condition A (B) in another study, while the latter two noise signals as
non-DE signals by equations h5,- = 5.7 -l- |8| and h6,- = 5.8 -l- |8| in all
samples of conditions A and B in the two studies, respectively. The six
hidden signals comprised hidden matrices H, = MIL-3],)" = 1, 2,. . . , 6, i = 1,
2, ..., n, for study s, s = 1, 2. Next, we formed a matrix W [600 x 6]
whose rows represent the combination coefﬁcients of the six hidden
signals for the G = 600 genes. We assumed the first 200 genes to be
true DEGs, of which the ﬁrst half are dominated in expression by the
ﬁrst hidden signal and the second half by the second hidden signal, and

the last 400 genes to be non-DEGs, of which the ﬁrst to third sets of 50
genes are dominated in expression by the third to ﬁfth hidden (noise)
signals respectively and the last 250 not by any hidden signal.
Accordingly, the matrix W was formed by (i) Sampling all elements w”,
1': 1, 2, . . . , 600,)" = 1, 2, . . . , 6 from U(0,0.S) and (ii) Replacing the elem-
ents w”, i=1,...,100, wa, i=101,...,200, wig, i= 201,...,250, wi4,
i= 251,...,300, Wis, i= 301,...,350, with random numbers from
U(0.S,1). Finally, we synthesized the simulation data by XS: WH,,
s = 1, 2. Similar to Simulation Data 1, we varied n = 6, 20, 50, 100,
200 to generate ﬁve data scenarios for examining the inﬂuence of
sample size.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Evaluation on simulation data I

We first evaluated our method using Simulation Data I.
Consider that the parameter k potentially inﬂuences the stability
of jNMF and thus the performance of jNMFMA. We varied
k = 10, 50, 100, 300, and ran jNMFMA with random initializa-
tion twice on a dataset and calculated the similarity (Pearson
correlation coefﬁcient) of the resulted two vectors of ds as a
measure of stability. For unbiased evaluation, 100 random simu-
lation datasets were generated in each of the ﬁve n data scen-
arios. We observed the changes of the similarity with k in the five
n scenarios (Supplementary Fig. S1). We found that the similar-
ity steadily increases as k increases, regardless of the n scenario,
suggesting that large ks enhance the stability of jNMF and thus
the reproducibility of jNMFMA. This should beneﬁt from the
fact that larger k results in sparser decomposition and increases
the reliability of capturing intrinsic biological signals underlying
the datasets. To tradeoff the decomposition stability and com-
putational cost, we set k = 300 in subsequent analyses.

It is also observed that true DEGs prefer a large d but non-DE
genes not in all the ﬁve data scenarios (Supplementary Fig. S2),
indicating the ability of jNMFMA to detect DEGs in meta-ana-
lysis context. The ability is also demonstrated by the changing
trend of false discovery rates (FDR) with rank thresholds of d
(Supplementary Fig. S3 (AiE)). As the rank threshold increases,
more genes are selected, and thus FDR increases and the curves
(l-FDR) go down gradually. It is also revealed (Supplementary
Fig. S3 (AiE)) that large ks led to low FDR, regardless of the
threshold used, which is in agreement with the changing pattern
of reproducibility (Supplementary Fig. S1). The comparison of
the receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curves between
jNMFMA and two straightforward meta-analysis methods, the
intersection (IndiV-Inters) and union (IndiVi-Union) sets of
DEGs from analyses on individual datasets, conﬁrms the com-
petent power of jNMFMA with highest average area under ROC
(AUC) of ~0.95 over the five n data scenarios (Supplementary
Fig. S3F).

3.2 Evaluation on simulation data 11

Based on the Simulation Data II, we further compared
jNMFMA with three popular methods, AW (Li and Tseng,
2011), REM (Choi et al., 2003), RankProd (Hong et al., 2006),
as well as the two straightforward methods, IndiV-Uinon and
IndiV-Inters, using the following measures: AUC; False positive
rate (FPR), FPR = FP/(FP -l- TN); False negative rate (FNR),
FNR = FN/(FN -l- TP); Positive predictive value (PPV),

where TP, FP, TN and FN are the numbers of true positives,
false positives, true negatives and false negatives, respectively.
Note that the three previous methods, AW, REM and
RankProd were implemented using the R packages, MetaDE,
GeneMeta and RankProd, respectively. Speciﬁcally, for
AW, the P values for individual study were calculated using
the modt method (as default) and the fudge parameter was
chosen to be the median variability estimator in the genome
(as default). Table 1 lists the results of jNMFMA and the five
previous methods in different n scenarios at an ad hoc P value
cutoff of 0.01. From this table, we can clearly see that the
performance of jNMFMA is superior to the previous methods
with highest ACC, highest PPV, highest MCC, highest AUC and
lowest FPRiFNR disparities in almost all ﬁve n data scenarios.
The advantage becomes more conspicuous as n increases.

3.3 Application to real-world lung cancer gene expression
datasets

In this analysis, three real-world lung cancer microarray datasets
collected from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) were
used: Selamat’s data (GSE32863) (Selamat et al., 2012),
Landi’s data (GSE10072) (Landi et al., 2008) and Su’s data
(GSE7670) (Su et al., 2007). These datasets used different micro-
array platforms to monitor gene expression: HG—U133A
Affymetrix chips for Selamat’s data, Illumina Human WG-6
V3.0 Expression BeadChips for Landi’s data and Affymetrix
Human Genome U133A array for Su’s data. Samples in the
three datasets were divided into LUAD and normal (NTL). In
the Selamat’s data, total 117 (58 LUAD and 59 NTL) samples
were monitored with the expression levels of ~25 441 genes. In
the Landi’s data, 107 (58 LUAD and 49 NTL) samples were
monitored with the expression levels of ~13 267 genes, and 54
(27 paired LUAD/NTL) samples were monitored with the
expression levels of ~13 212 genes in the Su’s data. We prepro-
cessed the three datasets as follows: The intensities of multiple
probes matching a same Entrez ID were averaged as the expres-
sion values of the gene, and non-speciﬁc or noise genes were
ﬁltered out using a coefﬁcient of variation (CV) filter (Li and
Li, 2008) with a CV cutoff of 0.05. Finally, 4728 common genes
were left for meta-analysis for identifying LUAD-related DEGs.
For extensive evaluation, we selected two datasets at a time
[C(3, 2) = 3 times] for meta-analysis. For presentation, the
three meta-analysis scenarios, Selamat data and Landi data,
Landi data and Su data and Su data and Selamat data, are
denoted as SeL, SuL and SuSe, respectively. The average out-
comes from the three meta-analysis scenarios were used for
comparison.

Table 2 lists the results by jNMFMA and the ﬁve previous
methods. The q-Values were calculated using SLIM (Wang et al.,
2011) for controlling FDR. From Table 2, we can see that
jNMFMA called 27% genes signiﬁcantly differentially expressed
at a p—Value cutoff of 0.01 and 36% genes at a q—Value cutoff of
0.1. As expected, AW identiﬁed the most proportions of DEGs

among the methods except for IndiV-Union, irrespective of the
P value or q-Value cutoffs used. RankProd identiﬁed smaller
proportions of DEGs than those by REM, which is in agreement
with the observations in (Hong and Breitling, 2008; Tseng et al.,
2012). Compared with these previous methods, jNMFMA has
two unique features: removing dependence structures and alle-
viating data heterogeneity. As described in Methods, jNMFMA
simultaneously transforms the datasets into a low-dimensional
space for removing gene correlations, and by introducing decom-
position error terms (Equation (1)), jNMFMA can also handle
data heterogeneity and study biases under a unified framework.
These features increase the reliability and robustness of
jNMFMA in detecting DEGs.

Because the truly DEGs are unknown, we employed
Correspondence At the Top (CAT) plots (Irizarry et al., 2005)
to evaluate the results of these methods. CAT plots are based on

the fact that genes identiﬁed in multiple independent studies are
likely to be truly signiﬁcant, and high reproducibility among
independent studies suggests a high reliability (Hong and
Breitling, 2008). In a CAT plot, the proportion of top m genes
identified in one analysis that are re-discovered in top m genes
based on another independent dataset is plotted against the
number m. As described above, in each of the three meta-analysis
scenarios (SeL, SuL and SuSe), two of the three LUAD datasets
were used for meta-analysis. To draw CAT plots in each
meta-analysis scenario, the dataset that was not included in the
meta-analysis was used as an independent dataset on which
individual analysis for DEG identiﬁcation was done. The results
from the individual analysis were compared with those from the
meta-analysis to produce CAT plots. For extensive comparison,
we included IndiV-Inters and another two previous methods, i.e.
Fisher’s and Stoufer’s (Tseng et al., 2012), both similar to AW
but in different weighted ways. Figure 2(A7C) shows the resulted
CAT plots by the methods in the three meta-analysis scenarios,
respectively. From these ﬁgures, it can be found that jNMFMA
led to highest overlapping proportions (except for m = 50)
among these methods for all the three meta-analyses, indicating
the superior reproducibility of jNMFMA. In contrast, the three
P value-based methods performed worst among these methods.
Another three methods, REM, RankProd and IndiV-Inters, ob-
tained very similar CAT curves as an intermediate between
jNMFMA and the three P value methods. RankProd had
slightly higher overlapping rates than REM and IndiV-Inters,
which is in agreement with the observations in (Chang et al.,
2013; Hong and Breitling, 2008). More interestingly, the repro-
ducibility clearly divides these methods into three groups: Group
I with high reproducibility, including only jNMFMA, group II
with moderate reproducibility, including REM and RankProd,
and group III with low reproducibility, consisting of the three P
value-based methods, AW, Fisher’s and Stoufer’s, as shown in
Figure 2(A7C). The grouping is likely related to the ways that the
two factors, data dependency and data heterogeneity, are
exploited in the meta-analysis methods: Both in Group I
(jNMFMA), only data heterogeneity in group II, and none or
little information in group III.

As expected, methods with higher proportions of identiﬁed
DEGs (Table 2) usually have a lower reproducibility, e.g.
RankProd, REM, AW and jNMFMA, as shown in Figure
2(A7C). However, although it called more DEGs than
jNMFMA (Table 2), IndiV-Inters did not produce a higher
reproducibility. This seemly suggests that jNMFMA obtained

more reliable DEGs while IndiV-Inters produced more false
positives.

We further examined how consistent the results by each
method are between the three meta-analysis scenarios. Similar
to the CAT plots, we calculated the ratio of intersection to
union genes (R) in top m genes from each meta-analysis scenario,
as shown in Figure 2D. From Figure 2D, it can be found that
jNMFMA obtained highest values of R among the methods for
almost all ms, confirming the best reproducibility of jNMFMA.
Figure 2D also witnessed the reproducibility-based stratifica-
tion of the meta-analysis methods revealed by CAT plots
(Fig. 2(A7C)).

3.4 Joint analysis of gene expression and methylation
datasets of lung cancer

Biologically, DNA methylation can alter the activity of cells by
regulating gene expression, and so it is critical to ﬁnd cancer-
related mDEGs whose abnormal expression is driven by their
own aberrant DNA methylation for understanding of cancer
pathology. To this end, we additionally downloaded an LUAD
DNA methylation dataset (Selamat Meth), originally pub-
lished in (Selamat et al., 2012), from GEO (GSE32867).
The methylation data were measured using the Illumina
HumanMethylation27 BeadChip platform. The platform was
designed to be limited to the 5’ promoter region (Novakovic
et al., 2011), and only 1576 of 27 578 probes on it targeted
non-promoter regions (>1kb from TSS). Because promoter
and intragenic DNA methylation tend to have opposite inﬂuence
on gene expression, we only considered ~27 000 promoter probes
in the analysis. For the genes measured using multiple probes,
their methylation levels were taken as those of the probes with

the maximum average beta-values over all samples. The dataset
contains 59 LUAD and matched adjacent normal (NTL) tissues.

We applied jNMFMA to meta-analyze the methylation
dataset and the above three expression datasets for identiﬁcation
of LUAD-related mDEGs. Among these datasets, there are
totally 3598 common genes, and we meta-analyzed the four
datasets based on the 3598 genes using jNMFMA. By jNMF,
14 deG and 11 umMG meta-genes were extracted at a RPM P
value cutoff of 0.05. Based on the two sets of DE metagenes,
we calculated d for each gene and their signiﬁcances by the
permutation test. Resulted P values were adjusted using SLIM
to obtain q—Values. We summarized the numbers of mDEGs
called significant at different cutoffs of p—Value or q-Value
(Supplementary Fig. S4). With an ad hoc q—Value cutoff of
0.05, we identiﬁed 260 mDEGs, of which 122 are hypomethy-
lated oncogenes-like genes with positive ds and 138 hypermethy-
lated suppressors-like genes with negative ds, as listed in
Supplementary Table S2.

Literature survey shows that many of the 122 hypomethylated
oncogenes-like mDEGs were previously reported to be related to
lung cancer. Take NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) (d = 2.4, P
value = 2E75 and q-Value = 0.0047). The gene has been recently
identiﬁed to be one of several genes most associated with tumor
growth in the lungs (Cappello et al., 2014). Biologically, NEK2 is
a cell cycle-related protein kinase located at a cell’s centrosome,
which regulates centrosome cohesion and separation through
phosphorylation of structural components of the centrosome.
Supplementary Fig. S5A barplots the expression and methyla-
tion levels of NEK2 (probe id: cg12820481; CpG island location:
1:209915094—209916382) in NTL and LUAD in the four datasets
used, showing that NEK2 is signiﬁcantly (P values<1Ei7 by
KruskaliWallis test) over-expressed in LUAD in all the three
expression datasets (Selamat, Landi and Su) and is signiﬁcantly
(P value = 0.06) hypomethylated in LUAD in the DNA methy-
lation dataset (Selamat Meth). NEK2 expression in non-involved
lung tissue was found to be associated with a 3-fold increased
risk of mortality from LUAD (Landi et al., 2008). Zhong et a].
(2014) demonstrated that NEK2 can be a proliferation marker in
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prognosis. Recent biological
experiments showed the overexpression of NEK2 activates the
Akt pathway and increases the levels of ﬂ-catenin protein, thus
leading to abnormal proliferation of cancer cells (Das et al.,
2013). By jNMFMA, the abnormal over-expression of NEK2
is found to be likely driven by its DNA hypomethylation in
LUAD (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Furthermore, we examined
the associations of the expression and methylation of NEK2 with
LUAD patient’s survival time on an independent data set from
TCGA (Downloaded on December 1, 2013). The TCGA data
contain 155 expression (76) or methylation (78) samples of
LUAD with disease-free survival time available. Supplementary
Fig. S6A shows the changes of the expression and methylation of
NEK2 in LUAD over four survival time intervals, <1, 173, 375
and >5 years. From this figure, it can be seen that survival time is
negatively correlated with the expression of NEK2 but positively
correlated with the methylation of NEK2, suggesting the
malignance of NEK2 expression and its alleviation by hypo-
methylation. The result is consistent with the increased expres-
sion and decreased methylation in LUAD relative to NTL
(Supplementary Fig. S5A).

Among the 138 hypermethylated suppressors-like mDEGs,
many of them were also previously reported to be associated
with lung cancer. For example, the TCF21 gene (d = 71.8, P
value = 4.8E75 and q—Value = 0.005) among them is well-
known to be frequently lost in human malignancies as tumor
suppressor. Supplementary Fig. S5B barplots the expression
and methylation (probe id: cg24215443; CpG island location:
NA) levels of TCF21 in LUAD and NTL in the four datasets,
showing that TCF21 is signiﬁcantly hypermethylated and under-
represented in LUAD. These patterns are consistent with the
changing trends of expression and methylation levels over the
four survival time intervals in the independent TCGA dataset
(Supplementary Fig. S6B). For TCF21, using restriction land-
mark genomic scanning, Smith et a]. (2006) experimentally
observed the epigenetic inactivation in lung and head and neck
cancers. Furthermore, using DNA sequencing technique,
Shivapurkar et a]. (2008) narrowed down a short CpG-rich seg-
ment (eight speciﬁc CpG sites in the CpG island within exon 1) in
the sequence of TCF21, which was observed to be unmethylated
in normal lung epithelial cells but to be predominantly methy-
lated in lung cancer cell lines. The short segment accounts for the
abnormality of TCF21 in lung cancer. The hypermethylation and
under-expression patterns of TCF21 are tumor specific and very
frequent in all types of NSCLCs, even in early-stage disease
(Richards et al., 2010). With these evidences, Richards et a].
(2010) suggested that TCF21 can be a potential candidate methy-
lation biomarker for NSCLC screening.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

We have proposed a new computational method (jNMFMA) for
transcriptomics data meta-analysis for detection of DEGs. The
method jointly factorizes multiple transcriptomics data matrices
into a low-dimensional metagene space. The joint factorization
can interrogate hidden dependence structures and reduce data
heterogeneity in omics data. Based on the extracted DE
metagenes by RPM, a new statistic d was formulated for mea-
suring differential expression of genes in meta-analysis context.
Experimental results on simulation data and real-world datasets
demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of jNMFMA in
transcriptomics data meta-analysis.

Despite the difference in combined information, most of exist-
ing methods treat each gene independently in estimating differ-
ential expression. However, plenty of dependence structures
inherent in transcriptomics data complicate the meta-analysis
and often lead to high FPRs of DEGs. jNMFMA uses joint
non-negative matrix factorization to address the data depend-
ency. CAT plots and other performance examinations
(Table 1; Fig. 2) conﬁrm the effectiveness of jNMFMA in deal-
ing with data dependency. jNMFMA also explicitly formulates
data heterogeneity and noise in terms of decomposition error as
in Equation (1) and thus allows for an immediate removal.
The CAT plots (Fig. 2) revealed three groups of meta-analysis
methods with different levels of reproducibility, which seems to
be related to the way to dealing with data dependency and
heterogeneity.

Another advantage of jNMFMA is the ﬂexibility in detecting
various types of DEGs, e. g. DEGs and mDEGs. The ﬂexibility is

especially useful for systems biology where molecular activities at
different levels could be positively or negatively correlated in
their co-functioning. Experiment on four lung cancer expression
and methylation datasets demonstrated the utility of the ﬂexibil-
ity in detecting potential cancer driver signatures (mDEGs) that
are distinguished from ‘passengers’ that do not biologically con-
tribute to tumorigenesis (AkaVia et al., 2010; D’Antonio and
Ciccarelli, 2013; Forde et al., 2014). The resulted genes, e.g.
NEK2 and TCF21, provide potential epigenetic strategy for
cancer treatment in the clinic.

jNMFMA has a parameter, the number (k) of decomposition
dimensions, to be preset in practice. Numeric experiments
(Supplementary Fig. S2) showed that large ks (e.g., k = 300)
generally lead to a high reproducibility of results. More favor-
ably, we would like to recommend to examine the similarity of ds
from multiple random runs of jNMFMA for a range of k and
choose the one with highest similarity.

We noticed that there are several possible directions to improve
jNMFMA. First, due to the non-negativity requirement of NMF,
jNMFMA is only applicable to non-negative datasets. Second,
the proposed method depends upon a relatively large number of
samples. Thirdly, considering that sparse NMF provides an im-
plicit way to control sparse matrix decomposition (Hoyer, 2004),
it is needed to explore the utility of sparse versions of jNMFMA
for better generality and interpretability of jNMFMA results.
Future works will be done to deal with these challenges.

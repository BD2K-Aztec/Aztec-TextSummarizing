ABSTRACT

Motivation: Most tumor samples are a heterogeneous mixture of
cells, including admixture by normal (non-cancerous) cells and sub-
populations of cancerous cells with different complements of somatic
aberrations. This intra-tumor heterogeneity complicates the analysis of
somatic aberrations in DNA sequencing data from tumor samples.
Results: We describe an algorithm called THetA2 that infers the com-
position of a tumor sample—including not only tumor purity but also
the number and content of tumor subpopulations—directly from both
whole-genome (WGS) and whole-exome (WXS) high-throughput DNA
sequencing data. This algorithm builds on our earlier Tumor
Heterogeneity Analysis (T HetA) algorithm in several important direc-
tions. These include improved ability to analyze highly rearranged gen-
omes using a variety of data types: both WGS sequencing (including
low ~7x coverage) and WXS sequencing. We apply our improved
THetA2 algorithm to WGS (including low-pass) and WXS sequence
data from 18 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (T CGA). We
find that the improved algorithm is substantially faster and identiﬁes
numerous tumor samples containing subclonal populations in the
TCGA data, including in one highly rearranged sample for which
other tumor purity estimation algorithms were unable to estimate
tumor purity.

1 INTRODUCTION

Several recent studies indicate that most tumor samples are a
heterogeneous mixture of cells, including admixture by normal
(non-cancerous) cells and subpopulations of cancerous cells with
different complements of somatic aberrations (Gerlinger et al.,
2012; Nik-Zainal et al., 2012). Characterizing this intra—tumor
heterogeneity is essential for several reasons. First, an estimate
of tumor purity, the fraction of cancerous cells in a tumor, is
necessary for accurate identiﬁcation of somatic aberrations of
all types in the sample. Most cancer genome sequencing studies

use a re-sequencing approach to detect somatic aberrations.
Reads from a tumor sample (and usually a matched normal
sample) are aligned to the human reference genome.
Differences in the sequence of aligned reads, the number of
aligned reads or the conﬁguration of aligned reads (e.g. split
reads or discordant pairs) are used to infer the presence of single
nucleotide or other small variants, copy number aberrations or
structural aberrations, respectively (Ding et al., 2010; Meyerson
et al., 2010). However, the presence of intra-tumor heterogeneity
can dilute the signals required to identify somatic aberrations.

Second, estimates of the composition of a tumor samplei
including not only the tumor purity, but also the number and
fractions of subpopulations of tumor cellsiprovide useful for
understanding tumor progression and determining possible treat-
ment strategies (Greaves and Maley, 2012; Mullighan et al.,
2008). In particular, clonal somatic aberrations that exist in all
tumor cells are likely early mutational events and their identiﬁ-
cation sheds light on the early stages of cancer. Conversely, sub-
clonal somatic aberrations might reveal properties shared by a
subset of tumor cells, such as drug resistance or ability to me-
tastasize. Identification of such aberrations and subpopulations
of tumor cells might inform treatment strategies, and/or help
predict metastasis/relapse.

In the past few years, several methods to infer tumor purity
and/or tumor composition have been developed. These methods
generally fall into two categories: (i) methods that use somatic
single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and (ii) methods that use som-
atic copy number aberrations. SNV-based methods such as
EXPANDS (Andor et al., 2014), PyClone (Roth et al., 2014)
and many others (Jiao et al., 2014; Larson and Fridley, 2013)
use clustering of variant allele frequencies to determine tumor
populations and frequencies. While these types of methods are
able to derive multiple tumor subpopulations, they often require
estimates of copy number for each region containing SNVs.
Deriving such estimates for highly rearranged aneuploid
tumors is as difficult as the estimation of intra-tumor heterogen-
eity itself. Moreover, these approaches require high-coverage
sequencing to overcome the high variance in read counts at in-
dividual SNVs. For example, both PyClone (Roth et al., 2014)
and PhyloSub (Jiao et al., 2014) explicitly require deeply
sequenced data. Thus, less expensive low-coverage sequence
data as generated in TCGA (Cancer Genome Atlas Network,
2012) is not amenable to these approaches.

Copy number-based methods such as ABSOLUTE (Carter
et al., 2012) and CNAnorm (Gusnanto et al., 2012) use observed
shifts in read depth due to copy number aberrations to predict

Quantifying tumor heterogeneity

 

tumor purity, but do not explicitly consider multiple tumor sub-
populations, and therefore may return purity estimates that only
reﬂect a single subpopulation of tumor cells in a sample. In
Oesper et al. (2013), we introduced the Tumor Heterogeneity
Analysis (THetA) algorithm to infer the composition of a
tumor sampleiincluding both the percentage of normal admix-
ture and the fraction and content of one or more tumor subpo-
pulations that differ by copy number aberrations.

In this article, we present THetA2, which extends the THetA
algorithm in several important directions. First, we substantially
improve the computation for the case of multiple distinct tumor
subpopulations in a sample. Second, we extend THetA to infer
tumor composition for highly rearranged genomes using a two-
step procedure where initial estimates are made using high-
conﬁdence regions of the genome, and then are extended to
the entire genome. Third, we devise a probabilistic model of
B-allele frequencies (BAFs), which can be used to solve the iden-
tiﬁability issue when read depth alone is consistent with multiple
possible tumor compositions. Finally, we extend THetA to ana-
lyze whole-exome (WXS) sequencing data. We apply our new
algorithm to both whole-genome (WGS) (including low-pass)
and WXS sequence data from 18 samples from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). We ﬁnd that the improved algorithm
is substantially faster and able to analyze highly rearranged gen-
omesiidentifying numerous tumors with subclonal tumor popu-
lations in the TCGA data. Where available, we compare our
purity estimates to published values for ABSOLUTE (Carter
et al., 2012). While the purity estimates are largely in agreement
for higher purity samples, we ﬁnd cases where ABSOLUTE fails
or underestimates purity, but THetA2 identifies multiple tumor
subpopulations. These improvements greatly expand the range of
sequencing data and tumors for which we can infer tumor
composition.

2 METHODS

2.1 Notation and problem formulation

We assume that the reference genome is partitioned into a sequence 1:
(11, . . .,Im) of non-overlapping intervals, according to changes in the
density, or depth, of reads aligning to each position in the reference (Xi
et al., 2011). Given 1, we deﬁne a corresponding read depth vector r = (r1
, . . . , rm) e N'” where rj is the number of reads with a (unique) alignment
within If. A cancer genome is deﬁned by an interval count vector c e N'”,
where cf is the integer number of copies of interval  in the cancer
genome.

A tumor sample T is a mixture of cells that contain different collec-
tions of somatic mutations, and in particular somatic copy number ab-
errations. Each subpopulation has a distinct interval count vector
representing the genome of the subpopulation. Following the model
introduced in Oesper et al. (2013), we represent T by: (i) an interval
count matrix C = [cl-’1‘] 6 NW" where cJ-Jc is the number of copies of inter-
val Ij in the kth distinct subpopulation; and (ii) a genome mixing vector 11
e AnL1={(111, ...,11,,)T|Z::111j=1, and 111- 3 0 for all j} where 11k is
the percentage of cells in T that belong to the k”‘ distinct subpopulation.

Let the interval count matrix C =(c1, . . . , on), where of is the jth col-
umn of C. We assume that C satisﬁes three constraints. (i) The ﬁrst
column c1: 2'” so that the ﬁrst component of the tumor sample is the
normal genome. (ii) The number n of subpopulations is less than the
number m of intervals. (iii) The copy numbers of the intervals are
bounded below by 0 and above by a maximum copy number k 3 2.

Thus, C e {0, . . . ,k}mx". We deﬁne Cm")c to be the set of all such C,
and deﬁne 9m,,,,k={(C,11)|C e Cm,,,,k,11 6 Ann} to be the domain of
pairs (C, 11) satisfying all constraints.

We model the observed read depth vector r using a multinomial prob-
ability distribution with parameter p= (p1, . . . , pm), where pf is the prob-
ability that a randomly chosen read will align to interval  A pair (C, 11)

deﬁnes a value for the multinomial parameter p= C11 =  Thus, the

negative log likelihood L(C,11|r)= — log (Mult(r; C11)) is the negative
log of the multinomial probability of observing counts r in the intervals
given the probability of a read aligning to an interval is deﬁned by 
The goal is to ﬁnd the interval count matrix C* and genome mixing
vector 11* that minimize the negative log likelihood:

(C*, W) = argmin(c,11)es2m,,L(C,1141') (1)

2.2 Interval count matrix enumeration

In this section, we derive an improved procedure to solve the optimiza-
tion problem (1). In Oesper et al. (2013), we showed that the function
L(C, 11; r) is a convex function of 11. Thus, for a ﬁxed interval count
matrix C, the optimal value of 11 can be computed efﬁciently. In the
important special case of a mixture of normal cells and a single tumor
population (n = 2), we reduce the domain of the interval count matrix C
to a set whose size is polynomial in m and guaranteed to contain the
optimal C*. This set is easy to enumerate, and we obtain an efﬁcient
algorithm. However, when a tumor sample contains multiple tumor sub-
populations (n >2), the algorithm in Oesper et al. (2013) enumerates all
C e Cm")c and checks whether each such C satisﬁes a particular ordering
constraint that is a necessary, but not sufﬁcient, condition for the optimal
C*.

In this section, we derive an algorithm that explicitly enumerates only
those matrices C that satisfy a more restrictive necessary ordering con-
straint for a mixture of any number of tumor genomes. All proofs are
contained in the Supplementary Material.

2.2.] Compatible order We say that vectors v = (v1, . . . , vm) and w =
(W1, . . . , Wm) e [R'” have compatible order provided all 1 5 i, j 5 m, v,- 5
vj if and only if w,- 5 wj. In Oesper et al. (2019\we proved that if (C*, 11*)
is optimal [i.e. satisﬁes Equation (1)] then C*11* and r have compatible
order. We deﬁne 8mm, to be the set of matrices C e Cm"), that satisfy this
ordering constraint: i.e. 8mm, = {C|C e Cm")c and E|11 6 Ann such that
C11 is in compatible order with r}. Thus, to ﬁnd the optimal solution
(C*, 11*), it is sufﬁcient to examine matrices C 6 8mm).

Without loss of generality, we assume that the read depth vector r=
(r1, . . .,rm) satisﬁes r1 5 r2 5  5 rm. Thus, the set 8mm):
{C E Cm,n,kl(CM)1 5 (C102 5 ... 5 (Cum for 50mm 6 AM}.

For a matrix C e Cm”), the set of 11 that result in a compatible order-
ing can be calculated using the function <1>(C) as follows:

mil
<1>(C)=j91{11|11 e AH such that (C11), 5 (C11)j,1}. (2)

Thus, a matrix C 6 8mm, if and only if <1>(C) is not empty. Corollary 2.1
follows directly from Equation (2).

COROLLARY 2.1. Suppose C e Cm”). Ifthere exists an i e {1, . . . ,m — 1}
such thatfor allt E {2, . . . ,n}, c,-,, > c,-+ 1,, and there exists at E {2, . . . ,n}

such that c,-,,>c,-+1,,, then <I>(C)= @.

2.2.2 Using a graph to enumerate 8mm), We now present an algo-
rithm to enumerate 8mm, for n 3 2. Consider a complete (including self
loops) directed graph GM, with a vertex for each possible row in a matrix
in (3mm). Paths on GM of length mil correspond to matrices in Cm")(
(See Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. Sl).

Fig. 1. The graph G11 is used to enumerate the matrices Sm,” as a subset
of the paths of length m7 1. The dashed edges can be removed by apply-
ing Corollary 2.1. The highlighted path corresponds to the matrix on the
right

To enumerate the subset of paths on GM that correspond to matrices
in Snmk, we use a depth-ﬁrst search. While building paths, we calculate
the set CI) for the matrix implied by the current path, and only proceed
down branches that do not result in the empty set (see Supplementary
Material for details). As a result, we are guaranteed to enumerate only the
matrices in Shank.

Corollary 2.1 allows us to reduce the graph GM by showing that there
are certain edges that will never appear in paths that correspond to matri-
ces in Sm”, and thus can be removed from the graph before matrix
enumeration. In the case where n = 3, the calculation of CI) is reduced
to a problem in a single variable, 

2.3 A two-step procedure for genome-wide inference of
copy numbers

In Oesper et al. (2013), we inferred tumor composition using a relatively
coarse interval partition I of the reference genome, considering only large
copy number aberrations. As a result, the published approach could not
readily be applied to highly rearranged genomes that are segmented into
many intervals. Moreover, manual selection of a subset of intervals was
typically required when analyzing samples containing multiple tumor
populations. Even with the improved enumeration procedure described
in the previous section, when more than one tumor subpopulation is
considered, the number of matrices C that need to be enumerated is
exponential in the number m of intervals. Moreover, the number of matri-
ces C is also exponential in the maximum copy number state k con-
sidered, making analysis of genomes with extensively ampliﬁed regions
more difﬁcult.

In this section, we present a two-step procedure for interval selection
that overcomes the limitations stated above, and allows us to infer the
composition of highly rearranged genome that are highly fragmented
and/or contains ampliﬁed segments with more than k copies. Our two-
step procedure consists of the following steps: (i) Select a set of high-
conﬁdence intervals and determine the most likely C and 11 for those
intervals. (ii) Use the estimates of C and 11 to determine copy numbers
for all other intervals in I not used in the ﬁrst step, thus allowing for
analysis of both highly ampliﬁed regions and fragmented genomes.

2.3.] Interval selection We automate the selection of a subset
of high-conﬁdence intervals used to determine the optimal (C*,11*)
for those intervals. Further details are included in the

Supplementary Material. Brieﬂy, we partition I into two sets of intervals:
(i) Iﬂihigh-conﬁdence intervals; (ii) ILilower-conﬁdence intervals. 11,,
is selected to contain up to a ﬁxed integer d longest intervals from I such
that each interval selected is longer than a predetermined minimum length
and is not obviously ampliﬁed beyond the speciﬁed max copy number k.
IL contains all remaining intervals from 1. Additionally, 11,, must repre-
sent > 10% of the total length of all provided intervals, otherwise the
sample is determined not to be a good candidate for analysis using
THetA2. Once 11,, and IL have been selected, we use the improved
THetA2 algorithm described in the previous section to calculate C2,
and 112 for just the intervals in IH.

2.3.2 Determining additional copy numbers: single row Given
(C* , 112) predicted for high-conﬁdence intervals IH, we infer copy num-
bers for the remaining intervals I L. We start with the simplifying assump-
tion that |IL| = 1. We prove the following theorem.

THEOREM 2.1. Let C=[c,-,,-] be an interval count matrix. L(C,11|r) is a
convex function of c,-,.

We use Theorem 2.1 to ﬁnd the optimal real-valued solution for
the ciJ’s corresponding to the single interval I 6 IL, given C2, and 112.
We then check the surrounding integer values to ﬁnd the integral
solution, which, by convexity, is guaranteed to ﬁnd the optimal integer
solution.

2.3.3 Determining additional copy numbers: multiple rows In the
previous section, we showed how to ﬁnd the optimal copy number for a
single additional interval in IL given optimal values C* , and 112 for a
set of high-conﬁdence intervals IH. To estimate copy numbers when
I 6 IL contains more than one interval, we estimate the optimal copy
numbers for each interval in I 6 IL when appended to C H individually
as described in the previous section, and then jointly append all inferred
copy numbers to C2, to obtain a new matrix CHUL. We then return
the solution (C HU L, 112). We note that this approach provides no
guarantee for ﬁnding the optimal copy numbers across all I 6 IL given
C2,, and 112,. However, in practice, we ﬁnd that the solutions returned by
our procedure are generally similar to this optimum (Supplementary
Table Sl).

2.4 Model selection

As in Oesper et al. (2013), we use the Bayesian information criterion
(BIC) to select from different sized models (i.e. different numbers n of
tumor populations) and their corresponding maximum likelihood solu-
tions. We use the standard BIC of —2log(L)-l-alog(b) where L is the
likelihood of a solution, a = (m -l- 1)(n — 1) is the number of free param-
eters in the model and b is the number of data points (the total number of
tumor and normal reads). In contrast, Oesper et al. (2013) used a mod-
iﬁed BIC that more strongly penalized solutions with more tumor popu-
lations. Such a modification is not necessary here, as our improved
algorithm considers copy number data across the entire genome, rather
than only a small number of intervals, reducing the possibility of over-
ﬁtting. Thus, we are able to more robustly identify samples with multiple
subpopulations of tumor cells.

2.5 Probabilistic model of BAFs

THetA2 may return multiple equally like pairs (C, 11) when using read
depth alone. We derive a probabilistic model of BAFsithe fraction of
reads containing the minor alleleithat may be used to distinguish be-
tween multiple pairs (C, 11). Let v = (v1, v2, . . . , v,,) be the observed BAFs
for q heterozygous germ line SNPs in the normal sample and w = (W1, wz
, . . . , w,,) be the corresponding BAFs from the tumor genome. We model
w as being drawn from Gaussian distributions whose parameters depend

on v, C and 11. We then select the (C, 11), which maximizes the likelihood
of the observed BAFs in the tumor sample:

1]
L(C,11|v,w)= P(w|8, 02) = HN(W,-|sgn(0.5 — w,-)8,-, a? (3)
i=1
Here a? is the observed variance for all heterozygous SNPs in v that lie
within interval  and 8, is the expected BAF deviation away from 0.5
given C and 11. See the Supplementary Material for further details.

2.6 Application to WXS data

Finally, we extend THetA2 for WXS data, where only the coding regions
of the genome have been targeted for sequencing. From WXS data we
need to infer the following two values: (i) a set of non-overlapping inter-
vals I: (11, . . . , Im) in the reference genome; and (ii) a corresponding read
depth vector r = (r1, . . . , rm).

To infer the interval partition I, we rely on recently developed algo-
rithms such as ExomeCNV (Sathirapongsasuti et al., 2011) and
EXCAVATOR (Magi et al., 2013) for segmentation and detection of
copy number aberrations from WXS data. The segmentation returned
by one of these algorithms may contain gaps rather than being a complete
partition of the reference genome, but still provides a set of non-over-
lapping intervals that may be used as input to THetA2. We note that
some methods use normalization procedures for GC content, mappability
and even exon length and this information is therefore implicitly incor-
porated into the input provided to THetA2.

We compute the read depth vector r=(r1, . . . , rm) for WXS data as
follows. Given a set I of non-overlapping intervals in the reference
genome, a set E of exons in the reference genome and a read length Z,
we set r,- =  where x, is the total number of sequenced nucleotides that
have a unique alignment to some exon e e E within interval  Thus, r, is
approximate count of the number of reads aligning to some exon located
in interval 1,.

3 RESULTS

We ran THetA2 on simulated data, WGS (including low-pass
data $7x coverage) and WXS data from 18 breast carcinoma,
ovarian carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear
cell and lung squamous cell carcinoma samples from TCGA
(Supplementary Table S2). Where available, we compare our
estimates of tumor purity to the estimates reported by the
ABSOLUTE algorithm (Carter et al., 2012) that estimates
purity from SNP array data.

The rest of this section is organized as follows. First, we dis-
cuss results on simulated data. Second, we demonstrate
THetA2’s performance on WXS data, including comparison of
results for samples for which both WGS and WXS data were
available. Next, we present in-depth analysis of several WGS
samples to demonstrate the efﬁcacy of THetA2 on highly rear-
ranged genomes, using both low-pass and moderate coverage
sequence data. Finally, we apply our probabilistic model of
BAFs to one sample and disambiguate between two equally
likely solutions.

3.1 Simulated data

We tested THetA2 on simulated data to demonstrate the im-
provements in THetA2 over the original THetA as well as
ABSOLUTE. We created simulated mixtures using real sequen-
cing data from an AML tumor sample and matched normal

fraction of the genome for which the copy number is incorrectly inferred
for the all copy number estimates, and when only considering intervals
that are longer than 1 Mb and 5 Mb

Research Network (2013). This sample was chosen because of
its high purity (~95% pure) and lack of copy number aberra-
tions as predicted by array data, providing high conﬁdence that
our simulated mixture and implanted copy number aberrations
are not confounded by impurity and aberrations in the real data.
Simulated mixtures are created by implanting random amplifi-
cations and deletions (see Supplementary Material) to create dif-
ferent tumor populations, and then creating a mixture
representing different tumor compositions.

3.1.] Mixtures with three subpopulations We ﬁnd that THetA2
computes the optimal solution orders of magnitude faster than
the original THetA (Fig. 2a). Using 30x simulated data, THetA2
demonstrates consistent accuracy at estimating 11 (error<0.05)
and copy numbers in the larger tumor population (error<0.1).
In addition, the accuracy in estimating copy numbers improves
for the smaller tumor population as its proportion increases
(Fig. 2b). Furthermore, THetA2 has increased performance at
estimating copy numbers for both populations when considering
only longer intervals. For example, when the smaller subpopula-
tion comprises 0.3 of cells in the sample and we consider only
intervals longer than 5Mb, the error rate for both populations
drops <0.06. We see similar trends using 7x simulated data, but
the lower coverage results in slightly worse copy numbers esti-
mates (Supplementary Fig. S2).

We also directly compare THetA2 with the original THetA on
this simulated data. The two-step method enables THetA2 to
infer copy numbers for 100% of the genome compared with
only 311% of the genome with the original THetA
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The expanded fraction of the genome
analyzed also translates into a substantial increase in the fraction
of genome with correct copy number estimates. In our simula-
tions, THetA2 correctly infers copy numbers for the larger and
smaller tumor subpopulation in 83787% and 28772% more of
the genome, respectively, than THetA (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Using the simulated mixture in Figure 3a, we demonstrate that
the improved enumeration procedure in combination with the

mixture of three subpopulations. (a) True simulated mixture including

ABSOLUTE. (right) The purity and ploidy reported in the most likely
and most likely using only Karyotype solutions output by ABSOLUTE

two-step method can lead to improved estimates of both 11 and
C. On this mixture, THetA2 is able to reconstruct both tumor
populations with accuracy >0.87 (Fig. 3b) across the entire
genome. However, because THetA is only able to consider a
small fraction of the genome, when applied to this mixture, it
has increased error at estimating 11 and completely misestimates
the smaller tumor subpopulation with error of 0.95 across the
regions for which copy number estimates were made and error of
0.99 across the whole genome (Fig. 30). We also applied
ABSOLUTE (Carter et al., 2012) to this mixture, run with de-
fault parameters, using the same partition of the genome output
by BIC-seq Oii et al., 2011). ABSOLUTE returns a collection of
12 different solutions, each with a different purity and likelihood
(Fig. 3d). The most likely solutions returned by ABSOLUTE
underestimate purity by at least 0.28 and estimated a tetraploid
solution, whereas the true sample has mean ploidy 1.75 and 1.77
in the two tumor populations. Further details are located in the
Supplementary Material.

3.1.2 Mixtures with four subpopulations To demonstrate the
extensibility of the model to greater numbers of subpopulations,
we create a simulated 30x coverage mixture containing four dis-
tinct subpopulations. Because of the increased runtime when
considering larger numbers of subpopulations, we use an alter-
native segmentation procedure to reduce the total number of
intervals (see Supplementary Material for details). We find that

on this simulation, THetA2 was able to estimate 11 with 0.05
error, comparable with the accuracy achieved for smaller num-
bers of subpopulations, and was able to correctly infer copy
number for 99.6% of the intervals considered, with the tradeoff
of only considering 87.6% of the total genome (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Further, we demonstrate how the output of THetA2
changes when the number of subpopulations (n) is ﬁxed below
the true number of subpopulations. In particular, we show that
in this case THetA2 still provides useful information about the
true mixture (Supplementary Fig. S6).

3.2 Extension to WXS data

To demonstrate THetA2’s effectiveness on WXS data, we ran
THetA2 on Illumina WXS data for the subset of 16 of the 18
tumor samples from TCGA for which WXS data were available
(Supplementary Table S2). For each sample, we used both
ExomeCNV (Sathirapongsasuti et al., 2011) and
EXCAVATOR (Magi et al., 2013) with default parameters to
determine an interval partition I (see Supplementary Fig. S7 for
the complete WXS workﬁow). If we assume that the tumor
sample is a mixture of normal cells and a single tumor popula-
tion, then the purity estimates obtained by THetA2 on the
ExomeCNV and EXCAVATOR interval segmentations were
similar for most samples (Supplementary Fig. S8). The two ex-
ceptions were two tumor samples where we ﬁnd subclonal copy
number aberrations (for one example see Supplementary Fig.
S9). We found that the presence of subclonal aberrations can
result in estimates of purity that are artiﬁcially low. For example,
a segmentation may not accurately distinguish all the present
subclonal aberrations. Thus, in the results below, we use the
THetA2 solution with higher purity estimate from the
ExomeCNV and the EXCAVATOR segmentations. Further
details are in the Supplementary Material.

3.2.] Comparison of THetA2 with ABSOLUTE On most sam-
ples, THetA2 purity estimates are within 0.08 of the estimates
reported by the ABSOLUTE algorithm (Carter et al., 2012)
(Fig. 4a). One example is the glioblastoma sample TCGA-06-
0214, for which we estimate purity of 0.67 compared with 0.66
reported by ABSOLUTE. However, although the purity esti-
mates are similar, THetA2 is additionally able to identify two
subpopulations of tumor cells, in 46.4 and 20.1% of cells in
sample (Fig. 4b) and determine which copy number aberrations
are part of each subpopulation.

There are two samples where THetA2 purity estimates are not
in agreement with those reported for the ABSOLUTE algorithm
(Carter et al., 2012) (Fig. 4a). The first is the ovarian carcinoma
sample TCGA-29-1768 where we infer multiple tumor subpopu-
lations and report a purity of 0.87 compared with 0.55 reported
by Carter et al. (2012). Notably, one of the tumor subpopula-
tions returned by THetA2 is in 54% cells. A possible explanation
is that ABSOLUTE reported the purity for the major tumor
subpopulation. The second is glioblastoma sample TCGA-06-
0188 which we infer to contain two tumor subpopulations con-
sisting of 43.1 and 20.3% cells. In comparison, ABSOLUTE
reports that the sample is highly non-clonal and is unable to
estimate purity. Our purity estimate of 0.7 is in the range of
0.30.8 reported by TCGA histopathology reports. We perform

exception of two outlier samples (red triangles; TCGA-29-1768 and TCGA-06-0188), both approaches predict similar estimates on high purity samples:
r = 0.9 from Pearson correlation coefﬁcient. Circled sample is TCGA-06-0214, for which both methods agree on sample purity. (b) Tumor composition

further analysis of this sample and find supporting evidence for
our estimated tumor composition (Supplementary Fig. S10).
These results demonstrate that consideration of multiple tumor
populations may be important for determining tumor purity,
especially for samples with large subclonal populations.

3.2.2 Consistency across sequencing platforms To further valid-
ate the results of THetA2 on WXS data, we compared results for
the 7 of the 18 TCGA samples for which both WGS (including
low-pass with $7x coverage) and WXS sequence data were
available. For WGS samples, we partition the reference
genome using the BIC-seq algorithm 0(i et al., 2011) run with
default parameters (see Supplementary Fig. S7 for WGS work-
ﬁow). We found that purity estimates for WXS data to be within
0.04 of purity estimates for WGS data for 4 of the 7 samples
(Table 1).

We also compare the copy number aberrations predicted for
the different subpopulations between the WXS and WGS data
using a similarity measure described in Table 1 caption. We find
that four of the genomes have 3 0.89 similarity under our meas-
ure (Table 1) for the major subpopulation. Notably, we ﬁnd that
THetA2 infers three subpopulations for sample TCGA-06-0214
on both WXS and WGS dataiselecting the n = 3 solution over
both n = 2 and n = 4 for WGS data (see Supplement) and has
similarity 0.92 between the data types for the minor subpopula-
tion. We also found similar copy number similarity results using
a less stringent measure that only considers copy number state
rather than exact copy number value (Supplementary Table S3).
These results demonstrate the consistency of THetA2iincluding
the inference of multiple tumor subpopulationsiacross different
types of sequencing data.

3.3 Analysis of highly rearranged and heterogeneous
genomes

One of the main advantages of THetA2 is the ability to analyze

highly rearranged genomes containing many copy number aber-

rations in one or more tumor subpopulations. We analyze in

further detail several highly rearranged genomes that THetA2
predicted to contain subclonal populations from WGS data.

3.3.1 Low-pass breast cancer samples TCGA-AZ-AOEU and
TCGA-AO-AOJL We used THetA2 to analyze two breast
cancer genomes, TCGA-A2-AOEU and TCGA-AO—AOJL, that
were sequenced with low-pass (5-7X) WGS sequencing. These
are the most rearranged of the breast cancer genomes that we
analyzedentaining many intervals in BIC-seq segmentation
(493 and 675 intervals respectively) and more predicted copy
number aberrations. We attempted to run ABSOLUTE
(Carter et al., 2012) on these genomes using the BIC-seq segmen-
tation. However, despite trying a range of values for the param-
eters, we obtained purity <0.3 for both samples. For comparison,
we cite the results reported by YadaV and De (2014) on these
samples, using ABSOLUTE and a different segmentation.

In both samples, THetA2 identiﬁes multiple subclonal popu-
lations. We infer that breast cancer sample TCGA-A2—AOEU
contains normal admixture with two distinct tumor subpopula-
tions, one with 42.7% cells and another with 34.6% cells
(Supplementary Fig. Slla). We note that our estimate of
tumor purity (0.77) is below the reported histopathology purity
of 0.90 for this sample, but closer than the ABSOLUTE estimate
of 0.49. We infer that breast cancer sample TCGA-AO—AOJL
contains normal admixture with two distinct tumor subpopula-
tions, one with 57.0% cells and another with 30.5% cells
(Supplementary Fig. Sllb). Despite being the most rearranged
of the breast cancer genomes analyzed, our estimated tumor
purity of 0.88 is near the reported histopathology value of
0.80. In comparison, ABSOLUTE inferred purity of 0.50 for
this sample. We are also able to identify a number of clonal
and subclonal chromosome arm level events for both genomes
(see Supplemental Material), as well as many other small events,
thus demonstrating that THetA2 can analyze highly rearranged
genomes with low-coverage WGS sequencing data.

3.3.2 Lung squamous cell sample TCGA-56-I622 We ran
THetA2 on a highly rearranged lung squamous sample
TCGA-56—1622, containing 2847 intervals in the segmentation.

multiple tumor populations (see Supplemental Material). “For sample TCGA—06—0214, WGS data were aligned to hg18 and WXS data aligned to hg19. See Supplementary
Table S3 for purity estimates across all genomes analyzed and results using an additional similarity metric. Bolding indicates the sample for which THetA2 can estimate purity,

but ABSOLUTE reports as highly non—clonal and is unable to estimate purity.

We note that this genome is so fragmented that ABSOLUTE
(Carter et al., 2012) does not attempt to estimate tumor purity
when run with default parameters. Moreover, this sample has so
many copy number changes that SNV-based algorithms (Andor
et al., 2014; Roth et al., 2014) would have extreme difﬁculty in
deﬁning regions of normal copy number to analyze. THetA2
infers that sample contains normal admixture with two distinct
tumor subpopulations, one with 50.1% cells and another with
18.1% cells (Fig. 5a). Using the new two-step procedure,
THetA2 also identiﬁes many smaller copy number aberrations
(Supplementary Fig. S12) and we ﬁnd that the read depth pre-
dicted using our reconstruction closely matches the observed
read depth (Fig. 5b).

We examine this sample in further detail using B-allele fre-
quency (BAF) information not used by THetA2. We constructed
a Virtual SNP array deﬁning the BAF at a known germ line SNP
to be the fraction of reads containing the minor allele as
described in Oesper et al. (2013). In diploid regions of the
genome that have not undergone any copy number changes,
we expect that the BAFs for germ line heterozygous SNPs to
be near a value of 0.5, as approximately half of the reads should
contain the B-allele. In a pure tumor sample a deletion of a
segment on a single chromosome will lead to a loss of heterozy-
gosity (LOH) and BAFs at 0 or 1 in a symmetric double banded
pattern centered around 0.5. As the sample become less pure (i.e.
more admixture by normal cells), the double banded pattern will
shift closer to 0.5.

In many of the regions where THetA2 predicted a clonal de-
letion (i.e. in all subpopulations), such as chromosomes 3, 5q and
18 (Fig. 5b), we observe that the BAFs cluster near 0 and 1, as
expected for a deletion occurring in a majority of cells in the
sample. Similarly, we ﬁnd that the shifts in BAF are consistent
with THetA2’s predictions of subclonal deletions in 50.0 and
18.1% of cells (Fig. 5b). On chromosome 1p, we observe a dis-
crepancy between THetA2’s predictions and BAF. THetA2 pre-
dicts that 1p is a clonal deletion; however, the BAFs are clustered
tightly around 0.5, indicating an equal number of both parental
copies of this region in the tumor sample. One explanation is that
1p is homozygously deleted in one of the tumor subpopulations,

rather than a heterozygous deletion in both subpopulations,
which would keep the balance of the parental copies of 1p in
the tumor sample.

3.4 Using BAFs

For glioblastoma sample TCGA-06—0145, THetA2 outputs two
possible (C, 11) pairs using only read depth 7 one largely haploid
and one largely diploid. We apply our probabilistic model of
BAFs and ﬁnd that the diploid reconstruction, which includes
rearrangements characteristic to glioblastoma such as amplifica-
tion of chr7 and deletion of chr10 (Sturm et al., 2014), is deter-
mined to be the more likely tumor composition (Supplementary
Fig. S13).

4 DISCUSSION

We introduced an algorithm to infer tumor composition 7 of
highly rearranged genomes from WGS (high or low coverage)
or WXS DNA sequencing data. These are implemented as im-
provements to our THetA algorithm. The THetA2 algorithm is
able to analyze highly rearranged, aneuploid samples that are
beyond the scope of existing algorithms that infer tumor hetero-
geneity. A recently published comparison of algorithms for infer-
ring tumor purity Wadav and De, 2014) showed that our
original THetA algorithm (Oesper et al., 2013) performed well,
but sometimes underestimated tumor purity when run to only
consider normal cells and one tumor subpopulation. We argue
that this purity underestimation is likely a result of not directly
considering all tumor subpopulations in the sample. In every
sample that we analyzed with the new algorithm, tumor purity
was higher when considering multiple tumor subpopulations.
Although the improved THetA2 presented here is useful on a
wide range of sequencing data from different tumors, some limi-
tations remain. First, THetA2 is unable to distinguish tumor
subpopulations that are not differentiated by copy number ab-
errations. As copy number aberrations are ubiquitous in most
solid tumors (Albertson et al., 2003), we expect that THetA2 will
be applicable to many genomes. However, for some diploid
tumors, SNV analysis is preferable. Incorporation of additional

information, such as BAFs for somatic and germ line SNPs,
into the model (Andor et al., 2014; Roth et al., 2014) may
also increase the scope of samples for which THetA2 is
applicable.

Second, while the improvements presented here greatly de-
crease the computational burden of the algorithm when consider-
ing multiple tumor populations, the algorithm remains
exponential in the size of the interval partition of the reference
genome7making it impractical to infer tumor composition with
more than a handful of subpopulations in many cases.
Identification of further mathematical restrictions to the
domain of interval count matrices, or use of sampling techniques
in place of complete enumeration are future avenues of investi-
gation, which may prove useful in this respect. Additionally,
when considering multiple tumor subpopulations, the quality
of the results is limited by features of the data including the
presence of copy number aberrations that distinguish

subpopulations as well as the number of sequence reads available
to identify these aberrations. The later is a function of sequencing
coverage, aberration length and proportion of cells that have the
aberration.

While the limited number of tumor subpopulations that
THetA2 analyzes may not be sufﬁcient to fully analyze tumor
progression, THetA2’s ability to recover subpopulations with
relatively low-coverage sequencing data can provide some insight
into tumor subpopulations in cases where methods that rely on
high-coverage data (Jiao et al., 2014; Roth et al., 2014) cannot.
Combining THetA2s output with other methods that do expli-
citly consider the phylogenetic history of a tumor such as Jiao
et al. (2014) or Hajirasouliha et al. (2014) may prove a useful
avenue of exploration.

The two-step procedure introduced here allows us to infer
subclonal copy number aberrations at much smaller scales.
However, some care is required to avoid overﬁtting the data,

particularly for small, subclonal copy number aberrations where
GC bias or other sequencing artifacts may lead to incorrect in-
ferences. Incorporating more sophisticated segmentation proced-
ures that account for such effects and appropriately scale read
counts (Benjamini and Speed, 2012) are useful directions for
future research.

Finally, this work focuses on the important first step of quan-
tifying intra-tumor heterogeneity from a single mixed tumor
sample. Downstream analysis including the clinical and func-
tional impact of the inferred tumor composition is an important
area for future work.

5 CONCLUSION

We present a new algorithm, THetA2, to infer the composition
of a tumor sampleiincluding both the percentage of normal
admixture and the fraction and content of one or more of
tumor subpopulations that differ by copy number aberrations.
The new algorithm builds on our THetA algorithm (Oesper
et al., 2013), and includes several improvements that allow us
to analyze highly rearranged genomes from WGS (high and low
coverage) or WXS sequencing data. In addition, the new algo-
rithm is orders of magnitude faster and allows us to use BAFs to
distinguish between different reconstructions.

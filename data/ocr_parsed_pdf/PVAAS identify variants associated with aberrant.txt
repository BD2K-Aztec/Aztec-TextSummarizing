Abstract

Motivation: RNA—seq has been widely used to study the transcriptome. Comparing to microarray,
sequencing—based RNA—seq is able to identify splicing variants and single nucleotide variants in
one experiment simultaneously. This provides unique opportunity to detect variants that associ—
ated with aberrant splicing. Despite the popularity of RNA—seq, no bioinformatics tool has been de—
veloped to leverage this advantage to identify variants associated with aberrant splicing.

Results: We have developed PVAAS, a tool to identify single nucleotide variants that associated
with aberrant alternative splicing from RNA—seq data. PVAAS works in three steps: (i) identify aber—
rant splicings; (ii) use user—provided variants or perform variant calling; (iii) assess the significance
of association between variants and aberrant splicing events.

Availability and implementation: PVAAS is written in Python and C. Source code and a compre—
hensive user’s manual are freely available at: http://pvaas.sourceforge.net/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing is the primary mechanism
to increase protein diversity in eukaryote (Graveley, 2001). In
humans, ~95% of multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced (Wang
et (11., 2008). On the other hand, this tightly regulated, sophisticated
nuclear process is also a natural source of disease-causing errors.
Genetic mutations in splice sites or other cis-regulatory sites (such as
exonic splicing enhancer, or E5E) can impair the splicing process
and lead to aberrantly spliced transcripts. Aberrant splicings are in-
creasingly recognized as responsible for human disease (Douglas
and Wood, 2011; Faustino and Cooper, 2003; Tazi et (11., 2009). It
is estimated that 50% of disease causing mutations affect splicing
(Lopez—Bigas et (11., 2005). Despite the importance of aberrant splic-
ing in disease development and progression, little work has been
done to identity the causal mutations that are directly associated
with aberrant splicing in genome scale.

The sequencing of the transcriptome using high-throughput
sequencing platforms provides a unique opportunity to study the as-
sociation between single nucleotide variants (5NVs) and splice vari-
ants. First, RNA-seq experiment is able to simultaneously identify

aberrant splicing events and 5NVs, a clear advantage compared with
microarrays. Second, spliced reads (i.e. reads that spanning exon-
exon junctions) provide physical evidence of the association between
variants and certain isoforms. To our knowledge, no bioinformatics
tool is currently available to characterize this association.

We have developed PVAA5, a program to detect 5NVs that are
associated with aberrant alternative splicing from RNA-seq data dir-
ectly. It efficiently handles large-scale data with hundreds of millions
of alignments.

2 Features and Methods

2.1 Extract and annotate spliced alignments

PVAA5 takes the commonly used BAM file as input (Li et (11., 2009).
5pliced reads are extracted from the original BAM file and anno-
tated using provided reference gene modells). For pair-end RNA
sequencing, the mates of splice-mapped reads are also extracted.
According to the annotation status of the 5’ splice site (5’55, or
donor site) and the 3’ splice site (3’55, or acceptor site), splicing
events are grouped into 3 categories: (i) canonical splicing (i.e. both

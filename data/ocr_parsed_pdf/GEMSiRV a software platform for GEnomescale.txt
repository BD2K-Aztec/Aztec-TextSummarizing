ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genome-scale metabolic network models have become
an indispensable part of the increasingly important field of systems
biology. Metabolic systems biology studies usually include three
major components—network model construction, objective- and
experiment-guided model editing and visualization, and simulation
studies based mainly on flux balance analyses. Bioinformatics tools
are required to facilitate these complicated analyses. Although some
of the required functions have been served separately by existing
tools, a free software resource that simultaneously serves the needs
of the three major components is not yet available.

Results: Here we present a software platform, GEMSiRV (gnome-
scale Metabolic model Emulation, Beconstruction and yisualization),
to provide functionalities of easy metabolic network drafting and
editing, amenable network visualization for experimental data
integration and flux balance analysis tools for simulation studies.
GEMSiRV comes with downloadable, ready-to-use public-domain
metabolic models, reference metabolite/reaction databases and
metabolic network maps, all of which can be input into GEMSiRV
as the starting materials for network construction or simulation
analyses. Furthermore, all of the GEMSiRV-generated metabolic
models and analysis results, including projects in progress, can be
easily exchanged in the research community. GEMSiRV is a powerful
integrative resource that may facilitate the development of systems
biology studies.

Availability: The software is freely available on the web at

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-scale metabolic networks (GEMS) are important for
understanding systems-level cellular behaviors. These networks
have been successfully applied to the studies of bacteria evolution,
metabolic engineering, biological network analysis and generation
and validation of novel biochemical hypotheses (Durot et al., 2009;
Feist and Palsson, 2008; Mahadevan et al., 2011). With the growing
availability of complete genomes, the number of GEMs is expected

to increase rapidly. However, the genome-scale reconstructions have
been progressing at a slow pace. Recently, a web-based resource
(Model SEED) was built to speed up the construction of new GEMs
by generating functional draft models on the basis of genomic
sequences (Henry et al., 2010). While GEMs can be generated
automatically through the Model SEED platform, an alternative,
bottom-up approach (Thiele and Palsson, 2010) has been highly
regarded and widely applied over the last decade because of its
expert opinion-reinforced accuracy and iterative reﬁnements that
integrate both computational and experimental advantages (Becker
and Palsson, 2005; Duarte et al., 2004; Feist et al., 2007; Navid and
Almaas, 2009; Nogales et al., 2008; Puchalka et al., 2008; Suthers
et al., 2009). However, a user-friendly tool that accommodates the
requirements of the bottom-up approach (which includes recursive
model reﬁnements that go back and forth between computational
and experimental analyses) remains unavailable. For example, the
researchers may wish to incorporate gene expression data into the
metabolic network by shutting down the reactions of which the
responsible genes are not expressed. This function, as far as we
understand, has not been provided by any existing tools.
Furthermore, tools that integrate functionalities of both GEM
reconstruction and subsequent computational analyses are very rare.
An important application of GEMs is ﬂux balance analysis (FBA).
FBA simultaneously monitors hundreds to thousands of biological
reactions and yields the integrated outputs of a single cell according
to the stoichiometric matrix and the biological/physicochemical
constraints that are imposed on the GEM of interest (Orth et al.,
2010). A limited number of software tools and packages have been
developed to enable FBA, thus allowing quantitative prediction
of cellular metabolisms. Examples include Acorn (Sroka et al.,
2011), BioMet Toolbox (Cvijovic et al., 2010), CellNetAnalyzer
(Klamt et al., 2007), COBRA (Becker et al., 2007), FBA-SimVis
(Grafahrend-Belau et al., 2009), Model SEED (Henry et al., 2010),
OptFlux (Rocha et al., 2010) and SBRT (Wright and Wagner, 2008)
(Table 1). However, none of these tools has the dual function of
FBA and GEM reconstruction. Meanwhile, free and open-source
reconstruction tools, including METANNOGEN (Gille et al., 2007)
and MetNetMaker (Forth et al., 2010) provide an environment for
constructing metabolic networks based on the KEGG database. Yet
these tools can neither perform FBA simulations nor import existing
models for further curations. Although YANAsquare (Schwarz et al.,
2007) is an integrated network reconstruction, visualization and
analysis tool, it cannot perform FBA. Furthermore, the major data
resource of these tools (the KEGG database) may include metabolic

reactions that are mass- or Charge imbalanced, which will seriously
compromise the accuracy of FBA. Another drawback of these tools
is that they require manual input of metabolic reactions (rather
than automatic reconstruction or import of existing models for
modiﬁcations), which is very time-consuming and error-prone in
View of the scale of GEMs. In sum, these publicly available tools
(listed in Table 1), though providing important functions in one or
a few aspects, do not satisfy the multi-facet needs of metabolic
network studies.

In View of the unmet needs of metabolic network studies,
here we provide GEMSiRV (gnome-scale Metabolic model
ﬁmulation, Reconstruction and yisualization), an integrated,
downloadable resource that can be used locally for semi-automatic
GEM reconstruction, manual curation, computational analyses and
visualization. GEMSiRV has the following advantages: ﬁrst, it
can be run on the local computers/servers, thus the restrictions
due to data size or internet speed can be minimized. Second,
it enables easy import and manual curation of existing models.
Expert opinions can be easily added into the draft networks
generated by other tools (e.g. Model SEED) to increase their
accuracy and reliability. Third, it allows researchers to perform
FBA by incorporating a freely available linear programming solver
(note that the user needs to install the solver before using the
FBA function). Fourth, GEMSiRV can accept high-throughput
experimental data for model reconstruction or reﬁnement. Finally,
GEMSiRV provides an interface for interactive, editable network
visualization. The interface is particularly useful for gap ﬁlling,
scientiﬁc discussions/publications and visualizing the Changes in
network when high-throughput experimental data are incorporated
in the model. The GEMSiRV package is freely downloadable at
http://sb.nhri.org.tw/GEMSiRV.

2 METHODS

GEMSiRV is implemented by using the Java language, which is becoming
increasingly popular in the scientiﬁc community for its portability. Note
that the GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) is required (the user needs
to install this solver) for GEMSiRV to perform FBA. To demonstrate the
features of GEMSiRV, we have constructed a web resource that includes
online help (http://sb.nhri.org.tw/GEMSiRV). The web resource contains
instructions for software download, installation and operation, a repository
of metabolic models, reference databases, metabolic maps and some useful
toolboxes.

3 RESULTS

GEMSiRV consists of three main modules: (i) metabolic network
reconstruction module, (ii) simulation module and (iii) visualization
module. It allows importing, editing, simulation analyses and
visualization of GEMs (Fig. 1).

3.1 Metabolic network reconstruction

3.1.] Model importing and editing Existing GEMs can be used
as references for the model construction of Closely related species,
and can greatly decrease the time and efforts required in building a
new metabolic model. The capability of taking existing GEMs for
model development is thus indispensable for an integrated systems
biology tool. The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) has
been developed as a stande format for data exchange between

different systems biology tools. Although GEMs in the SBML
format can be easily imported into a variety of tools (Hucka et al.,
2003), information loss during SBML ﬁle import usually occur
because it is difﬁcult for existing tools to exhaustively accommodate
the wide variety of model-speciﬁc data features (Durot et al.,
2009). To tackle this issue, GEMSiRV provides four user-editable
reference databases, all of which include the metabolites and
metabolic reactions retrieved from a large number of existing GEMs
(the details can be found in the following section). The loss of
information can thus be compensated by manually adding or editing
metabolic reactions with reference to these databases, and model-
speciﬁc features can be tailored by the user. Note that such data
integration and model editing are not provided by other existing
tools.

3.1.2 Construction of reference databases Since a GEM is
an assembly of biochemical reactions, a reference database that
includes rich information regarding metabolites and reactions will
greatly accelerate the process of model reconstruction. Considering
that most of the published GEMs adopted the naming conventions
of BiGG (Schellenberger et al., 2010), Model SEED (Henry et al.,
2010), MetaCyC (Caspi et al., 2012) or KEGG, we collected
metabolite and reaction information separately from these resources
to build four metabolic reference databases (Table 2). The reference
databases are freely available at the GEMSiRV website via the

GEMSiRV

 

‘Reference Databases’ hyperlink (http://sb.nhri.org.tw/GEMSiRV/
en/Reference_Databases). Since the information of metabolite
Charge is unavailable for KEGG’s and Model SEED’s compounds,
‘not available (NA) for Charge balance’ will be noted when the
reactions that include these metabolites are evaluated. Users can
also start their own model reconstruction projects from scratch
with the pre-constructed reference database if appropriate reference
models are unavailable. For metabolites or reactions not present in
the reference database, users can deﬁne theses metabolites/reactions
and create their own databases using the GEMSiRV interface. In
addition, the metabolites and reactions in the imported models
can be overwritten or added to the reference databases. The
customized reference databases can be saved and exported as
spreadsheet ﬁles, which are easily portable and exchangeable. Note
that uniﬁed nomenclature across the reference databases is strongly
recommended to prevent redundant data entries and inconsistencies
within or between models.

3.1.3 Draﬁ reconstruction An imported model can be used as
a reference for drafting a new GEM if the reference species is
genetically Close to the target species. Given a user-provided list
of orthologous genes, GEMSiRV enables automatic extraction from
the reference model the ‘orthologous reactions’ (i.e. reactions that
are catalyzed by the protein products of orthologous genes) that
conform to the gene—protein reaction (GPR) associations deﬁned in
the reference model. This function can not only greatly reduce the
efforts required for manual model construction but also help evaluate
whether the GPR associations are conserved between the reference
and the target species (Liao et al., 2011a).

3.1.4 Model reﬁnement In GEMSiRV, users can curate and
further reﬁne the draft models generated by Model SEED or
GEMSiRV. By using the simulation and visualization modules,
users can identify dead-end metabolites and blocked reactions in
the models, which represent the model gaps to be corrected by the
users. In addition, the reference database built in GEMSiRV can
provide candidate metabolic reactions for gap ﬁlling.

3.2 Simulation

GEMSiRV implements the major FBA functions that are included
in the COBRA toolbox (Fig. 2). With a built-in linear programming
solver, the intuitive interface of GEMSiRV allows users to perform
various in silico analyses for their imported/constructed GEMs and
generate biological hypotheses according to the simulation results.
The GEMSiRV Simulation module provides the following functions.

3.2.1 Dead-end metabolite identiﬁcation A metabolic network
can be converted to a stoichiometric matrix-based mathematical
model. The mathematic model describes how the network reactions
are connected to each other and deﬁnes the boundaries of the
biological system (which usually refers to a cell) and cross-boundary
material exchanges. GEMSiRV can examine the connections of all
metabolites in a network and identify and mark dead-end metabolites
with a cross in the map of a metabolic network (e.g. in Fig. 2A, fru
is a dead-end metabolite). Identiﬁcation of dead-end metabolites is
critical for debugging the draft model because such metabolites will
lead to errors in subsequent simulation analyses.

3.2.2 Objective optimization With a built-in linear programming
solver (e.g. GLPK), GEMSiRV can be used to perform simulations
for the imported or newly constructed metabolic network models.
For example, the user may wish to simulate the growth of a bacterial
species under certain nutritional constraints. GEMSiRV can then
search in the constraint-based solution space of reaction ﬂuxes and
optimize the ﬂuxes for the biomass objective function. The reaction
ﬂuxes can be saved and presented in the map of metabolic network
with the GEMSiRV Visualization module. And the most effective
and efﬁcient pathway through the network will be highlighted by
the composed reactions carrying ﬂuxes with different color codes
(Fig. 2B).

3.2.3 Flux variability analysis Flux variability analysis can be
used to study the redundancy of reactions in a network. GEMSiRV
can determine the minimum and maximum ﬂux for each reaction in
the model and thus can also identify the blocked reactions (which
always carry zero ﬂuxes). These reactions can be marked with a
cross in the map of a metabolic network (in Fig. 2C, for example,
FRUPts2 is a blocked reaction).

3.2.4 Robustness analysis Robustness analysis can be used to
study how Changing a reaction ﬂux can affect other reaction ﬂuxes
or certain objective functions (e.g. growth rate). In GEMSiRV, at
most two reaction ﬂuxes can be altered simultaneously. The results
of the robustness analyses can therefore be presented as 2D (one
altered ﬂux) or 3D (two altered ﬂuxes) plots (Fig. 2D).

3.2.5 Gene/reaction essentiality analysis GEMSiRV can
simulate deletion of a reaction by constraining its ﬂux to zero.
Similarly, simulating deletion of a gene can be done by stopping
all of the reaction ﬂuxes corresponding to the gene of interest.
If the cell (model) fails to grow after a reaction/gene is deleted
in silico, this reaction/gene is considered as essential for the
in silico growth (and possibly, the biological growth) of the cell.
GEMSiRV can perform essentiality analysis for genes and reactions
separately, and determine the ratio of the objective ﬂux (the ﬂux of
reaction/gene-deleted model divided by the ﬂux of the wild type)
(Fig. 2E).

3.2.6 Gene deletion analysis In GEMSiRV, gene deletion
analysis is carried out by in silico knocking out one or more than
two genes simultaneously, as described in the above section. Such
in silico knock-outs can simulate biological gene knockouts or
transcriptional regulatory constraints (i.e. regulatory suppression
of gene expression). GEMSiRV can generate the constraint-based
reaction ﬂuxes and an SBML ﬁle for the in silico knock-out model.
Such knock-out models can be again imported into GEMSiRV for
other network analyses or editing.

3.3 Visualization

In addition to network reconstruction and simulation, GEMSiRV
provides an interface for editing and visualizing the metabolic
networks of interest. KEGG pathway maps or the maps in
CellDesigner format can be directly loaded into GEMSiRV, and a
user-modiﬁable map can be easily produced based on the loaded
map. For example, a genome-scale map for iYL1228 (Liao et al.,
2011b) generated by GEMSiRV is available on the web. With
the uniﬁed nomenclature for metabolites and reactions in the

network model, GEMSiRV allows data exchange between network
reconstruction, model simulation and visualization of reaction ﬂuxes
and gene expression levels. Fig. 3 demonstrates an example of
network map in which simulated reaction ﬂuxes and experimental
gene expression levels under aerobic and anaerobic conditions are
simultaneously imported into GEMSiRV. Such data integrations
enable the user to evaluate whether the FBA solutions are consistent
with the gene expression data. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst open-source software to provide such interactive features for
genome-scale network reconstructions.

4 DISCUSSION

The recently published systems biology tool Model SEED has
greatly reduced the efforts needed to construct GEMs. Applying
the models constructed by this type of tool to further studies
requires a user-friendly, integrated, interactive interface for model
editing, simulation and visualization. GEMSiRV is designed to

accelerate network reconstruction and to facilitate generation of
new biological hypotheses by supporting simulation analyses
of metabolic networks and providing functionalities of data
integration and visualization. GEMSiRV also provides ready-to-use
downloadable reference databases, metabolic maps and published
metabolic models in its website. Therefore, GEMSiRV along with
its web resource may greatly expedite GEM reconstructions, and can
accelerate the development of biomedical applications of metabolic
network reconstructions. One of the advantages of GEMSiRV
is that, unlike other metabolic network tools, GEMSiRV allows
all of the projects-in-progress to be easily exchanged or shared
between researchers. GEMSiRV can therefore facilitate information
exchanges and communications (including metabolic network
models, simulation results and network maps) in the research
community for high-quality metabolic network reconstructions and
applications. GEMSiRV is, to the best of our knowledge, the
only tool that simultaneously provides functionalities of GEM
reconstruction, simulation analyses, data integration, model editing

GEMSiRV is not only an integrated network reconstruction tool
but also a tool for knowledge and learning of systems biology.

researches.

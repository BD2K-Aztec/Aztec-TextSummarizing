glycans that are generated by using the synthetic pathways of N-linked
glycans in human (Krambeck and Betenbaugh, 2005). Alternatively, users
can choose to build their own N— or O-linked glycan list in a comma
separated values (CSV) ﬁle. For LCiESIiMS data, after retrieving the
ions from the input data, MultiGlycan matches these ions with a set of
glycan masses and adducts from a built-in or user-deﬁned list.

In the ﬁnal report, MultiGlycan automatically merges the same glycan
across consecutive MS scans. MultiGlycan also provides an intuitive
quantitation measure. Each output associated with a glycan is the sum-
mation of peaks with and without adducts in the whole-isotope envelope
in the spectrum, and then summed within an elution window. These
results can be directly used in large-scale glycomics studies.

3 RESULTS

MultiGlycan was tested on six LCiMS datasets acquired from
two N—glycan samples, released by using 60U of PNGase F
(Flavobacterium meningosepticum), from ribonuclease B
(RiboB), human serum glycoproteins (HBS) and glycoproteins
from three cancer cell lines, respectively (for details, see in Sup—
plementary Table Sl).

A Dionex 3000 Ultimate nano—LC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale,
CA, USA) connected to a Velos LTQ Orbitrap hybrid mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc, San Jose, CA, USA) was used
for permethylated N—glycan analysis in this study. The mass spec—
trometer was operated in data—dependent acquisition mode with
one scan event containing a full—scan MS along with a collision
induced dissociation MS/MS, and another scan event containing
a full—scan MS (m/z from 500 to 2000). In the analysis of native
RiboB, only MS scans were acquired.

The complete list of glycan proﬁling results from MS spectra
within datasets used in this analysis can be found in
Supplementary Tables S2784. The program reports high—man—
nose N—glycans for both standard RiboB samples as expected:
four of ﬁve known N—glycans for the permethylated and three of
ﬁve for the native sample were reported (see Supplementary
Tables S2 and S3, respectively). MultiGlycan annotated 79
N—glycans in the HBS sample, and 53 of them matched the
manually annotated ones from an earlier study (Hu and
Mechref, 2012) (Supplementary Table S4). Additionally, 26
N—glycans annotated by MultiGlycan were conﬁrmed by
manual annotation (Supplementary Fig. $1). The addition of

adducts enables more conﬁdent assignment to glycan compos—
itions that otherwise are difﬁcult to assign simply using p.p.m.
mass error. For example, in HBS experiment, an ion at
1090.572 m/z can be matched to two different glycan compos—
itions within 10 p.p.m., viz., [HexNAcSHexgdeHex2+3H]3+ and
[HexNAcSHex7deHexlNeuAcl+NH4+2H]3+. However, the
presence of isotopic distribution at 1084.893 m/z accounts for
[HexNAcSHex7deHexlNeuAcl+3H]3+ (see the corresponding
MS/ MS spectrum in Supplementary Fig. S2) allowing the correct
assignment of [HexNAcSHex7deHex1NeuAcl] to this glycan.
Thus, clustering isotopic distributions that are linked by adducts
in this manner enables accurate annotation for glycan profiling.

We compared MultiGlycan performance with GlycoReSoft on
the HBS and three other cancer cell line samples. In HBS among
the 45 glycans that GlycoReSoft found, 35 were conﬁrmed
manually that are all contained in the reported 79 glycans by
MultiGlycan (Supplementary Table SS and Supplementary Fig.
S3). The remaining 10 were not reported in the study conducted
by Hu and Mechref (2012). In three cancer cell line samples,
MultiGlycan also identiﬁed more glycans than GlycoReSoft,
most of which are consistent with manual annotation (Table 1,
also see Supplementary Tables 8&88 and Supplementary Figs
$486).

MultiGlycan allows users to run the analysis directly on the
raw ﬁle. Moreover, it can handle multiple adducts, and any
speciﬁed glycan list. All these features make MultiGlycan a
robust tool ready for high—throughput glycomic data analysis.

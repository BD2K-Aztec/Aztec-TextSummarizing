ABSTRACT

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short abundant non-coding
RNAs critical for many cellular processes. Deep sequencing (next-
generation sequencing) technologies are being readily used to
receive a more accurate depiction of miRNA expression profiles in
living cells. This type of analysis is a key step towards improving our
understanding of the complexity and mode of miRNA regulation.
Results: miRNAkey is a software package designed to be used as
a base-station for the analysis of miRNA deep sequencing data.
The package implements common steps taken in the analysis of
such data, as well as adds unique features, such as data statistics
and multiple read determination, generating a novel platform for the
analysis of miRNA expression. A user-friendly graphical interface is
applied to determine the analysis steps. The tabular and graphical
output contains general and detailed reports on the sequence reads
and provides an accurate picture of the differentially expressed
miRNAs in paired samples.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs abundant
in all animal cells. These small non-coding molecules bind to
mRNA transcripts and control their expression through facilitated
mRNA degradation or protein inhibition (Bushati and Cohen,
2007). miRNAs are involved in many cellular processes suggesting
their dominant role in regulation of gene expression (Shomron
et al., 2009). MiRNA expression proﬁling, obtained under different
conditions or from cells of different origins, provides a basis
for the investigation of the regulatory role of miRNAs in
health and disease (Calin and Croce, 2006). Deep sequencing
(next-generation sequencing) platforms have recently emerged
as powerful technologies providing unprecedented insights into
biological systems (Metzker, 2010). With automated sequencing
technologies becoming routinely used, the data acquisition of
millions of sequence reads per experiment leads researchers to the
subsequent challenge of data analysis.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Currently, there are several available software packages that
facilitate the analysis of small RNA short-read data. Each software
is designed via different approaches bearing its advantages and
some limitations. Particularly, software packages for miRNA data
analysis such as miRDeep (Friedlander et al., 2008), do not provide
differential expression analysis between known miRNAs in the input
samples and do not have a graphic interface. We note that this
(and other) software is designated to predict novel miRNAs. Other
tools, such as UEA sRNA toolkit (Moxon et al., 2008), miRanalyzer,
(Hackenberg et al., 2009) Squuster (Pantano et al., 2010), DSAP
(Huang et al., 2010) and mirTools (Zhu et al., 2010), require many
processing steps and are mostly web based, thus are either limited
in ﬁle size or add a long upload stage to the analysis process. This
is underscored by the fact that many owners of deep sequencers do
not have access to large-scale computing facilities or are not savvy
with their use. Finally, none of the existing software provides a
method to rigorously deal with multiply mapped reads (Wang et al.,
2009). Treating multiply mapped reads correctly is essential since
small RNAs inherently result in short reads (even shorter than the
accustomed 36 nt) and consequently these reads tend to be mapped
to multiple genomic locations. Most current software packages for
the analysis of small RNA sequencing data remove such reads from
the analysis, thus sacriﬁcing the accuracy of any expression proﬁle
generated.

Here, we introduce miRNAkey, a software package designed to
be used as a base station for the analysis of miRNA sequencing
data. miRNAkey can be locally run on any Unix/Linux or Mac
computer with 64-bit architecture via the graphical user interface, or
on a computer-cluster via the command line. The software is freely
available for download at http://ibis.tau.ac.il/miRNAkey.

2 METHODS

MiRNAkey is an intuitive tool. for the implementation of the ﬁrst steps
of analysis of deep sequencing data obtained in miRNA sequencing
experiments. The main steps include: (i) searchng for and removing the
adaptor sequence from the 3’-ends of the reads; (ii) mapping the reads to
known miRNA databases. such as miRBase; (iii) counting reads mapped
to the different miRNA species in each sample (i.e. sequencing lane).
and converting these counts into the normalized RPKM expression-index
(reads per kilobase per million mapped reads) to allow comparison across
experiments; (iv) quantifying differential expression for miRNAs between
paired samples. using chi-squared analysis. thus obtaining P-Values for the
differential expression of miRNAs; (V) generating additional information
regarding the input data. such as multiple mapping levels and post-clipping
read lengths (see further explanation in Supplementary Data).

An important and unique feature of miRNAkey is the use of the recently
developed SEQ-EM algorithm (Pasaniuc et al.. 2010). for optimizing the
distribution of multiply-aligned-reads among the observed miRNAs. rather
than discarding them. as is commonly done in this type of analysis. For
miRNA data. multiply aligned reads make for a signiﬁcant fraction of the
data. especially for datasets with abundant miRNAs of similar sequence.
such as the case in humans. where multiply aligned reads constitute up to
30% of the mapped reads. Accordingly. discarding this portion of the data
may lead to a signiﬁcantly different and biased expression proﬁle.

Differential expression of miRNAs between paired samples is measured
using a chi-squared statistic (see Supplementary Data). P-Values are
calculated for the null hypothesis of no differential expression between the
two samples. Final P-Values are corrected using the Bonferroni correction
for multiple hypotheses testing.

Deep sequencing was carried out at the Tel Aviv University Genome High-
Throughput Sequencing Laboratory following Illumina’s Small RNA sample
preparation protocol V1.5.

3 RESULTS

The main output generated by miRNAkey is a table comparing each
pair of samples/ﬁles. This table contains the union of the observed
miRNAs in the two samples, ranked from most differentially
expressed, to least (see Supplementary Fig. 1). Each line contains
the read-counts and RPKM expression indices for a speciﬁc miRNA
in the two samples, and the differential expression measure for
the miRNA between the two samples, along with a P-value and
additional useful information such as data statistics and multiple
read determinations. The ranking of miRNAs allows the user
to focus on the most differentially expressed miRNAs in a pair
of samples/conditions, thus reducing the high volumes of data
generated from deep sequencing experiments. Additionally, many
other output reports and plots are generated by miRNAkey (see
Supplementary Data), along with ﬁles to be used in downstream
analysis.

Since miRNAkey is a ﬂexible stand-alone application we found it
more appropriate to map the short reads to a known miRNA database
(minase) rather than to an entire reference genome. This allows a
much faster and more ﬂexible analysis with minor compromising in
accuracy (see description in Supplementary Data).

We used miRNAkey to evaluate differential expression for a pair
of samples. The samples consisted of a viral infected cell line,
versus a non-infected control (see Supplementary Data). The exact
extracted total RNA was used for deep sequencing analysis and
for quantitative real-time PCR. Using miRNAkey, we discovered
a number of highly differentially-expressed miRNAs between the
two samples, which are likely to be pivotal players in the viral
infection process. The most prominent miRNAs were also validated
using quantitative real-time PCR and indicated a strong correlation
between the methods (see Fig. 1).

4 CONCLUSION

miRNAkey is a software package designed as a base station for
the analysis of miRNA sequencing data. A friendly graphical user
interface is applied to determine the analysis steps. The tabular
output contains general and detailed reports on the sequence
reads and provides an accurate picture of the differentially
expressed miRNAs in paired samples. miRNAkey can run on
a local Unix/Linux or Mac computer and deals with multiply
mapped miRNA reads. The software can be downloaded at

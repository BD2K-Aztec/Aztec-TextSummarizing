ABSTRACT

Motivation: A number of methods have been reported that predict
protein—protein interactions (PPls) with high accuracy using only
simple sequence-based features such as amino acid 3mer content.
This is surprising, given that many protein interactions have high
specificity that depends on detailed atomic recognition between
physiochemically complementary surfaces. Are the reported high
accuracies realistic?

Results: We find that the reported accuracies of the predictions
are significantly over-estimated, and strongly dependent on the
structure of the training and testing datasets used. The choice of
which protein pairs are deemed as non-interactions in the training
data has a variable impact on the accuracy estimates, and the
accuracies can be artificially inflated by a bias towards dominant
samples in the positive data which result from the presence of hub
proteins in the protein interaction network. To address this bias,
we propose a positive set-specific method to create a ‘balanced’
negative set maintaining the degree distribution for each protein,
leading to the conclusion that simple sequence-based features
contain insufficient information to be useful for predicting PPls, but
that protein domain-based features have some predictive value.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein interactions (PPIs) are responsible for many critical
functions and processes in biology, and are highly relevant to disease
states. While experimental measurements are able to discover
protein interactions at high throughput, they can be biased to speciﬁc
types of interaction or unlikely to discover all interactions, and
cannot be applied to all relevant species. As a result, a number

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

of researchers have studied how well machine learning methods
are able to predict PPIs from protein sequence information alone
(Ben-Hur and Noble, 2005; Bock and Gough, 2001; Chou and Cai,
2006; Gomez et al., 2003; Guo et al., 2008, 2010; Martin et al.,
2005; Nanni and Lumini, 2006; Park, 2009; Pitre et al., 2006, 2008;
Roy et al., 2009; Shen et al., 2007; Sprinzak and Margalit, 2001;
Yu et al., 2010). They have reported impressive performance using
a variety of simple sequence features (such as counts of 3mers of
neighbouring residues) and developed sophisticated pairwise kernels
to allow classiﬁcation using support vector machines (SVMs). The
performance measures reported are much better than one would
expect, and we have found that they are very sensitive to the content
of the datasets used in training and cross-validation. In particular,
the presence of ‘hub’ proteins that interact with many other proteins
in the positive dataset leads to a strong bias that invalidates most
performance estimates.

Recently, Park (2009) has benchmarked four methods on yeast
and human data, found signiﬁcant performance differences and
highlighted some effects of training and testing data on performance
estimates. However, the datasets used in this benchmark still suffer
from bias of dataset content reported here. In this work, we present a
method to remove this bias and demonstrate the effect on predicting
PPIs from simple sequence features: that simple sequence-based
kernels do not predict PPIs. We now summarize some approaches
taken to predict PPIs from sequence data, all of which should be
reinterpreted following our ﬁndings. Ben-Hur and Noble (2005)
used a SVM method with a pairwise kernel and evaluated a
number of sequence features, including the ‘spectrum kernel’ where
the protein sequences are represented by the counts of 3mers of
neighbouring residues (Leslie et al., 2002). This leads to a ﬁxed
length (n=8000) feature vector for each protein regardless of the
sequence length. The pairwise kernel allows comparison of pairs
of proteins, avoiding any problems that may be introduced by
concatenating feature vectors for each protein, and on a yeast dataset
performance of the SVM gives a receiver operator characteristic
(ROC) area under curve (AUC) score of 0.81. Similarly Martin
et al. (2005) used symmetric 3mers (n=4200) and a pairwise
kernel giving accuracy of 70.3% on human data (and 69.0%
for yeast). Accuracy of 83.9% was reported to be achieved by
Shen et al. (2007) on human PPI data using 3mers of residues
grouped into seven categories (n=343) and an S-kemel similar in
function to the previous pairwise kernels. Guo et al. (2008, 2010)

Simple sequence-based kernels do not predict PPIs

 

represented residues in seven categories with an auto-covariance
method and reported high accuracies using shufﬂed sequences as a
negative set, but poor results on randomly sampled negative data.
Roy et (11. (2009) proposed using simple amino acid composition
features (normalized counts of single or pairs of amino acids) and
reported results on a par with those obtained using protein domain
information.

There exist a number of datasets of protein pairs which have been
determined to interact by high-throughput methods (Costanzo et (11 .,
2010; Gavin et (11., 2006; Ito et (11., 2001; Stelzl et (11., 2005; Yu
et (11., 2008) and can be used as positive data to train and validate
prediction methods. In particular, many experiments have been
conducted on yeast, and a PPI network consisting of 156 673 non-
redundant interactions exists in BioGRID (Stark et (11., 2006), and
a high-conﬁdence dataset of 6568 non-redundant interactions has
been published (Batada et (11., 2007). For human, the Human Protein
References Database (HPRD) contains 38 945 non-redundant high-
quality interactions (Peri et (11., 2004), and the BioGRID database
contains 30 851 non-redundant interactions (Stark et (11., 2006).
The choice of a set of negative examples (non-interacting protein
pairs) to use in training and validating prediction methods is
particularly important since few techniques can conduct a large-scale
measurement of non-interacting pairs (Doerr, 2010; Smialowski
et (11., 2010). The latest negative dataset, Negatome (Smialowski
et (11., 2010), derives non-interactions from literature curation and
protein complex structural data of the Protein Data Bank and can
be seen as a meaningful start in the systematic construction of a set
of reliable non-interactions in a biological context. However, each
of the prediction methods reported above used a random sampling
approach (sometimes modiﬁed by cellular localization information),
selecting a negative set by random sampling of pairs of proteins
that exist in the positive set but for which there is no evidence of
interaction.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

The datasets of interactions were processed to ﬁlter out redundant samples,
self-interactions and proteins whose sequence contained elements other than
the 20 standard amino acids. For yeast, 154 828 non-redundant positive
interactions (47 335 physical interactions and remainder genetic) were
extracted from the BioGRID database (Stark et a1., 2006) (3.0.64.mitab). For
human, 36 134 non-redundant positive physical interactions were extracted
from the HPRD (Peri et a1., 2004) (Release9_041310), which was used in
Shen et a1. (2007). In addition 27 307 human interactions extracted from the
BioGRID database (3.0.64.mitab) were used to ﬁlter ‘potential interactions”
in creating negative candidates (see below) (16993 PPIs overlap between
these two sets). Sequence data used for yeast was from the Saccharomyces
Genome Database (http://downloads.yeastgenome.org/) (ﬁle orf_trans.fasta),
and for human was from UniProt (The UniProt Consortium, 2010) (ﬁle
uniprot_sprot.fasta). For evaluating Pfam features, version 24.0 of the
Pfam Database (Finn et a1., 2010) (pfam-A.hmm) was used. HMMER3.0
(http://hmmer.org) was used to scan the protein sequences. Smaller datasets
were constructed to test the performance of Pfam features. For yeast, we used
the high-conﬁdence physical interaction dataset from Batada et a1. (2007)
(HC-BIOGRID-2.0.31.tab) and ﬁltered out all interactions that involved a
protein with no Pfam domain hits, resulting in a dataset containing 5621
interactions. For human, we took the intersection of the two human datasets
described above, and again ﬁltered out all interactions that involved a
protein with no Pfam hits, resulting in a dataset containing 15 804 physical

interactions. We consider a ‘Pfarn hit” when the match has an E-value (full
sequence) of less than 0.01, similar to the methods of Gomez et a1. (2003).

2.2 Choosing a subset

Owing to the computational demand of the large datasets, we chose a subset
of the interactions. Subsets were formed by choosing at random 300 proteins
for yeast or 1500 for human, and then selecting all interactions involving any
of those proteins. This creates an interaction dataset that maintains the vertex
degree distribution of the large dataset. Typically, subsets contained ~15 000
interactions between ~4000 proteins for yeast and ~10 000 interactions
between ~5300 proteins for human. We created 10 subsets at random and
report average performances of 10-fold cross-validations (10 X 10 cv) in each
of these subsets.

In order to test the stability of performance measures on subsets
of different sizes, and also to examine the effect of excluding genetic
interactions, we sampled four subsets of ~50007~20 000 interactions from
the yeast physical interactions in the BioGRID database (Stark et a1.,
2006) (3.0.64.tab2). Ten cross-validations were performed on each subset,
respectively.

2.3 Negative dataset construction

From the positive set of N interactions, the complement graph can be formed
as the set of all possible pairs of proteins in the positive set for which a
positive interaction is not present. Since we created subsets of the whole
PPI network, we formed the negative candidate graph from the subset”s
complement graph. Interactions that exist in the BioGRID database (Stark
et a1., 2006) were removed from the negative candidate graphs to reduce the
potential for real interactions appearing erroneously in the negative sets. Self-
interactions were also excluded. For simple random sampling, N edges were
chosen from the negative candidate graph, ensuring that each protein that
appeared in the positive dataset also appeared at least once in the negative
dataset. Each protein was taken in turn and a connected edge randomly
sampled from the negative candidate graph and added to the negative set
until all N edges were chosen. For balanced random sampling, the number
of times each protein appears in the negative set is equal to the number of
times it appears in the positive set. Taking proteins in the positive dataset
in turn, beginning with the protein of largest vertex degree, we randomly
sampled edges from the negative candidate graph connected to the current
protein until the vertex degree in the negative set was equal to that in the
positive set.

The balanced random sampling method is available in the BRS-nonint
software. Input to this software is the positive interaction dataset, as well
as the pairs which should be avoided in choosing negative data. All the
interactions (one pair per line) should be input with a format of ‘proteinA
proteinB interacting”.

2.4 SVMs and kernel functions

The methods of Ben-Hur and Noble (2005) and Shen et a1. (2007) were
evaluated, and the SVMs were implemented by modifying the code of
libsvm-2.91 (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm). From (Ben-Hur and
Noble, 2005), the TPPKgmo kernel represents each protein as a length
8000 feature vector v, of normalized counts (normalized to sum to one) of
each possible triple of amino acids (the 3mer spectrum kernel). The kernel
takes cosine form, kc(X, Y): (v5), - véy)/sqrt((vu -v§x) >< (v5y -v;y)), for proteins
X and Y with feature vectors v” and vSy, respectively, and the pairwise
kernel for proteins pairs (APB and C7D) is calculated as a tensor product,
KTppK((A, B),(C, D)) = kc(A,C) >< kc(B, D)+kc(A, D) X kc(B,C). From (Shen
et a1., 2007), the S-kernel343 represents each protein as a length 343 feature
vector v, of normalized counts (normalized by the largest) of each possible
conjoint triadi3mers of residues grouped into seven categories. Squared
Euclidean distances between proteins are calculated, dg(X, Y): | |vtx —v,y| |2
and the pairwise S-kernel is Ks((A,B),(C,D))=exp(—y||s| |2) with s:
min(dg(A, C)+dg(B,D),dg(A,D)+dg(B, C)). SVM parameters C: 128 and

J. Yu et al.

 

y=0.25 were used as in Shen et al. (2007). For the Pfam kernel, a feature
vector of counts of Pfam hits (see above) was created, and the TPPK pairwise
kernel was used on these feature vectors (length 1932 and 3400 for yeast
and human, respectively, as this many distinct Pfam features were detected).
Similar results were obtained using other representations of the Pfam features
(such as scores, E-values or binary presence/absence of domains).

2.5 Performance evaluation

Performances were reported by the AUC values (area under the ROC curve,
a perfect classiﬁer has AUC = 1, random performance gives AUC = 0.5) with
10-fold cross-validations. Variation in performance between 10 subsets or
10 cross-validations was quantiﬁed as ‘average :l:range”. Similar to ROC50
in Ben-Hur and Noble (2005), we also report ROC<05%) (the area under
the ROC curve for false positive rate 50.5%), which measures just the true
positives detected before 0.5% of false positives.

3 RESULTS

The structures of the various datasets are illustrated in Figure 1,
which clearly shows the hub proteins in the positive set, reﬂecting
the well-known power-law distribution of vertex degrees, and how
this is replicated in the negative set generated by the method of
balanced random sampling but not simple random sampling.

3.1 Prediction performance and dataset bias

SVM performance results are reported in Table 1. The TPPKSOOO
kernel (Ben-Hur and Noble, 2005) predicted PPIs with an AUC of
0.95 on the yeast dataset, when trained and tested with a negative
set constructed by simple random sampling. We also reproduced
the reported results of 0.81 AUC on the set of 10517 yeast
interactions used in Ben-Hur and Noble (2005). However, when
a balanced negative dataset was used, the performance fell to 0.5
AUC, indicating that performance was close to random (AUC = 0.46
on the same dataset of Ben-Hur and Noble using balanced sampling).
This highlights the bias inherent in the structure of the datasets
constructed using a random sampling approach that does not account
for the number of times each protein appears in the positive and
negative datasets. This is also conﬁrmed by similar results for
predicting PPIs on human datasets (0.83 AUC versus 0.55 AUC
on balanced dataset), again indicating the bias, and revealing the
poor performance of the classiﬁer based on these simple sequence
features.

Using the S-kemel343, we obtained performance of 0.67 AUC
on human data with a negative set generated by simple random
sampling and our own implementation of the methods of Shen et (11.
(2007). Using a negative set constructed by balanced sampling this
was reduced to 0.55 AUC. On yeast data, the AUC score dropped
from 0.72 to 0.53 when the balanced negative set was used.

The data in Table 2 show the effect of using different subset
sizes, and restricting the yeast dataset to physical interactions only
(NB: the human data in Table 1 already consist entirely of physical
interactions). Similar to the above results, the AUC values drop
from ~0.9 (simple random sampling) to 0.6 (balanced sampling),
and these values are stable for different subset sizes. Comparing
these values to the Table 1 results for yeast, shows that omitting
yeast genetic interactions leads to AUC values about 0.05 lower
for simple random sampling and 0.1 higher for balanced sampling.
The decrease in AUC from simple random sampling when genetic
interactions are omitted is probably caused by a decrease in dataset

bias: genetic interactions lead to hubs of higher vertex degree in the
positive dataset. The increase in AUC for balanced random sampling
could perhaps indicate that physical interactions are slightly more
predictable from simple sequence features than genetic interactions,
but this is not borne out in all datasets (see for instance the smaller
dataset of physical interactions used in Table 3, vide infra).

3.2 Predictions based on other sequence features

The above results suggest that the prediction of protein interactions
from simple sequence features is very difﬁcult. An alternative is
to employ evolutionary information, in the form of recognizable
conserved domains within the sequence, because it is known that
some domains have propensities to interact with other domains,
and their presence in the sequence could therefore be predictive
of interactions to some extent. We used Pfam (Finn et (11., 2010) to

identify domains and used a vector of counts of these domains in
each sequence with the TPPK kernel to predict PPIs. We found
that the Pfam domains are useful features for predicting PPIs,
demonstrated by the result of 0.73 AUC on yeast and 0.75 AUC
on human using a negative set generated by balanced sampling,
and therefore contain stronger information about PPIs than we
are able to extract from a spectrum kernel representation using
current state of the art machine learning methods (see Table 3 for
comparison with the TPPKSOOO and S-kernel343 spectrum kernels
on the same PPI network datasets). The Pfam features encode
information that is useﬁil in predicting PPIs, rather than encoding
for particular proteins, demonstrated by a similar result of 0.74 AUC
on yeast and 0.77 AUC on human using a negative set generated
by simple random sampling: here there is minimal bias from the
positive and negative dataset composition since the features allow
the generalization of the important relationships between Pfam
features present in protein sequences, rather than learning to identify
that speciﬁc proteins tend to appear more in one set.

4 DISCUSSION

The high accuracy reported in the literature for predicting PPIs from
simple sequence features appears to be an artefact of the datasets
used to train and validate methods. In simple terms, if datasets
are used where some proteins (hubs) appear many more times in
the positive set than the negative set, then a machine learning
method will learn this, predict positive interactions preferentially
for these proteins and seem to be highly accurate. The sequence
feature vectors used are of high dimension and allow machine
learning methods to identify such speciﬁc proteins. The accuracies
are unrealistic because the intended application is ﬁnding interactors
for a speciﬁc protein from the entire proteome, of which even hub
proteins only interact with a small fraction. It seems in fact that
simple sequence features are little better than random in predicting
protein interactions, when the task is to distinguish positive and
negative interactions that occur in equal number for each protein in
balanced positive and negative datasets.

It is clear that the choice of negative data is critical in training and
performance evaluation for machine learning methods; in particular,
there must be no systematic differences between positive and
negative datasets used in training and evaluation that are not present
in the datasets of intended application. While it is clear that the
Negatome (Smialowski et (11., 2010) dataset will be useful in method
development, it is also probable that this set will have its own
biases, for instance towards well-studied proteins in the literature,
and proteins that appear in the structural database. It will therefore
have to be used with care in prediction method development.

While simple sequence features are not strongly predictive of
interactions, the presence of conserved domains does contain some
predictive information. But even then, accuracy is only moderate.
Given that the a priori probability of interaction of a protein and
a partner chosen randomly from the entire proteome is quite low,
any of these methods will be susceptible to a high rate of false
positive predictions. Protein interactions depend exquisitely on the
three-dimensional atomic structures of the proteins concerned, and
their detailed spatial and temporal pattern of expressions in the cell.
Our ability to predict these interactions from information only in the
sequence is, at present, too poor to be useful.

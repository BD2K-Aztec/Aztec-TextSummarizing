ABSTRACT

Motivation: Many protein—protein interactions (PPls) are mediated
by protein domains. The structural data of multi-domain PPls reveal
the domain pair (or pairs) that mediate a PPI, and implicitly also the
domain pairs that are not involved in the interaction. By analyzing
such data, preference relations between domain pairs as interaction
mediators may be revealed.

Results: Here, we analyze the differential use of domain pairs
as mediators of stable interactions based on structurally solved
multi-domain protein complexes. Our analysis revealed domain pairs
that are preferentially used as interaction mediators and domain
pairs that rarely or never mediate interaction, independent of the
proteins’ context. Between these extremes, there are domain pairs
that mediate protein interaction in some protein contexts, while
in other contexts different domain pairs predominate over them.
By describing the preference relations between domain pairs as a
network, we uncovered partial order and transitivity in these relations,
which we further exploited for predicting interaction-mediating
domains. The preferred domain pairs and the ones over which
they predominate differ in several properties, but these differences
cannot yet determine explicitly what underlies the differential use
of domain pairs as interaction mediators. One property that stood
up was the over-abundance of homotypic interactions among the
preferred domain pairs, supporting previous suggestions on the
advantages in the use of domain self-interaction for mediating protein
interactions. Finally, we show a possible association between the
preferred domain pairs and the function of the complex where they
reside.

1 INTRODUCTION

Domains are considered as the fundamental building blocks
determining the structure and function of proteins. Many domains
were specialized to mediate the interaction of proteins with other
molecules. For example, there are DNA-binding domains, RNA-
binding domains and domains that mediate interactions between
proteins. Protein—protein interaction (PPI) is usually achieved
either via interactions between domains and short motifs (Pawson

et al., 2002), often in transient interactions, or by domain—domain
interactions (DDIs) (Pawson and Nash, 2003), often in stable
interactions. Analyses of structurally solved PPIs determined the
domain pairs that are used as interaction mediators (Finn et (11.,
2005; Stein et (11., 2005, 2009). Further analysis of these DDIs
has revealed distinct domain pairs that are repeatedly used as
interaction mediators in different protein contexts. Moreover, it was
shown that a statistically signiﬁcant fraction of the interactome of
various organisms can be attributed to these interacting domain pairs
and that they are evolutionarily conserved (Itzhaki et (11., 2006;
Schuster—Bockler and Bateman, 2007).

It is conceivable that protein domains that mediate interactions
with other molecules were optimized through evolution to perform
this function. Therefore, while the domain repertoire of a proteome
deﬁnes thousands of theoretically possible interacting domain pairs,
only a fraction of these pairs seem to actually mediate protein
interactions. Furthermore, certain domain pairs mediate interactions
in some protein contexts but not in others, in which there are other
domain pairs opted for this task (as exempliﬁed in Fig. l). The data of
multi-domain PPIs solved by crystallography reveal many examples
of such variability in the utilization of domain pairs as interaction
mediators. For example, the self-interaction of the domain Hpt (Pfam
accession PF01627, Finn et (11., 2008) is used for mediating the
interaction in all solved complexes containing it, independent of
other domains. On the other hand, the GHMP kinase N-terminal
domain (PF00288) mediates dimerization by self-interaction in some
protein contexts (e.g. Mevalonate kinase), but not in others (e.g.
Galactokinase), where other domains mediate the dimerization.
Notably, the structural data of multi-domain PPIs reveal the domain
pair (or pairs) that mediate a PPI, and implicitly also the domain
pairs that are not involved in the interaction, enabling a systematic
analysis of such preference relations. Here we carry out such an
analysis, using reliable DDI and PPI data from solved structures of
multi-domain protein complexes. We report on a partial order in the
preferential use of domain pairs as interaction mediators, compare
properties of the domains that may underlie this order and show
by a few examples possible ﬁlnctional implications of our ﬁndings.
We also demonstrate the utilization of this order for predicting the
domains mediating experimentally determined PPIs.

Fig. 1. Domain pair relations. (A) An example of context-dependent DDI.
Protein P1 contains domains a and c, and protein P2 contains domains b and
d. Domain a in P1 and domain b in P2 mediate the interaction between P1 and
P2. In principle, there are four combinations of domain pairs that can mediate
the interaction: (a,b), (a,d), (c,b) and (c,d), but actually three combinations
do not take place and only (a,b) is responsible for the interaction. However
(a,b) might not mediate the interaction in a different context, for example,
when P1 interacts with another protein, P3, which contains the domains b
and e. For the P17P3 interaction, the possible domain pairs are (a,b), (a,e),
(c,b) and (c,e), but the interaction is mediated only by (c,e). Thus, in the
context of the domains of P1 and P2, (a,b) mediates the interaction, but in
the context of the domains of P1 and P3 (a,b) does not mediate the interaction
and another domain pair, (c,e), does. (B) Description of the relations between
the domain pairs described in (A) as a network, where nodes represent the
domain pairs and edges point from the domain pairs mediating an interaction
to the domain pairs over which they predominate. The domain pair (c,e) is
preferred over the domain pairs (a,b), (a,e) and (c,b), as derived from P17P3
interaction. The domain pair (a,b) is preferred over the domain pairs (c,b),
(a,d) and (c,d), as derived from P17P2 interaction. Hence, the domain pair
(c,e) predominates over the domain pair (c,b) both directly and indirectly.
Such a pattern in the domain pair relation network implies transitivity and
would suggest preferential order of the domain pairs when used as interaction
mediators. (C) A transitive pattern in the actual domain pair relation network.
For clarity, the domains in the network are numbered: 1. 3’ exoribonuclease
family, domain 1 (PF01138); 2. OB fold (CL0021); 3. K-Homology (KH)
domain Superfarnily (CL0007). (D) A sub-network containing a transitive
pattern, as described in (C) (highlighted in red). The additional domain
numbers represent: 4. 3’ exoribonuclease family, domain 2 (PF03725); 5.

we kept DDIs with 3DID Z-score >03 and with at least six residueiresidue
contacts, which we consider more reliable. Notably, 98% of the interactions
had Z-score >1 [for the Z-score description, see Supplementary Material
(Stein at al., 2009)]. In order to use the correct biological unit, we used also
data from SNAPPI-DB (Jefferson at al., 2007), which is based on the Protein
Quaternary Structure database (Henrick and Thornton, 1998) and retrieved
the SNAPPI-DB’S DDIs. We combined the information from SNAPPI-DB
and 3DID to generate the database of PPIs and DDIs used in the analysis. In
order to avoid bias in the analysis due to overrepresentation of evolutionarily
related structures or of identical and similar structures reported by different
groups, we compared the protein sequences in our database using BLAST
(Altschul at al., 1990). When sequences were found by BLAST to be similar
with E-Value 510—3, only one representative of them was kept in the data.
In addition, viral proteins were excluded from the database. We labelled
the proteins by their Pfam (Finn at al., 2008) domains, or, when relevant, by
domain clans, where a clan contains several similar domains clustered by the
Pfam database. Throughout the article, domain and clan names contain the
preﬁx PF and CL, respectively. Finally, for each PPI we extracted all possible
domainAiomain, claniclan or clanidomain combinations. The basic units in
our analysis are these pairs and we term them throughout the article domain
pairs, even though some of them consist of clans.

2.2 Analysis of connected patterns in the network of
domain pair relations

We used the data of all domain pairs and the information on their use as
interaction mediators, and described these relations between domain pairs
as a network, in which every node is a domain pair and edges point from
domain pairs that are used to mediate an interaction to the domain pairs
over which they predominate. In the main analysis, we did not distinguish
between edges based on their weight, and all edges were included. In a more
stringent analysis that followed, we included only edges which appeared at
least twice in our data (Table 1). When a protein interaction was mediated
by two or more domain pairs, no relations were deﬁned between them. In
cases where one domain pair predominates over a second domain pair in the
context of one PPI, and the second domain pair predominates over the ﬁrst
one in another PPI, a bi-directional edge was assigned between these nodes.

3For each property we carried out a paired Wilcoxon test, analyzing the differences in
the property value between all domain pair nodes connected by an edge in the network
of domain pair relations. For description of the properties studied and the computation
of their values, see Supplementary Figure 4. When a preference relation (edge in the
network) appeared in more than one PPI instance, we computed the average value of the
property difference over all instances. When the relations involved a clan, we regarded
the actual domains leading to the preference relations. In these cases, we computed the
averages of the differences between the properties of the corresponding domain pairs.
bThe numbers of compared couples of domain pairs depend on the property computed.
For example, for the length and phylogenetic age computations we used the actual
domain pairs included in the clans, and therefore the number is higher than the total
number of edges. On the other hand, for some properties, such as number of contacts,
values could be obtained only for domain pairs with solved structures.

To ﬁnd the connected patterns we used the Cytoscape NetMatch plugin (Ferro
at al., 2007; Shannon at al., 2003). We also created random networks that
maintain the number of nodes and the degree of each node as in the actual
network (Shen-Orr at al. , 2002; Yeger-Lotem at al. , 2004), and compared the
numbers of connected patterns in the actual network to those in the random
networks.

2.3 Comparison of properties between preferred and
non-preferred domain pairs

For each property we carried out a paired Wilcoxon test, analyzing the
differences in the property value between all domain pair nodes connected
by an edge in the network. For properties that are computed per domain
(such as length) the value of a domain pair was computed as the average
of values of the individual domains comprising it. When a preference
relation (edge in the network) appeared in more than one PPI instance, we
computed the average value of the property difference over all instances.
When the relations involved a clan, we regarded the actual domains leading
to the preference relations. In these cases, we computed the averages of
the differences between the properties of the corresponding domain pairs
(Table 2).

2.4 Prediction of DDIs using the order of domain pairs

We used the order in the network of domain pair relations to predict which
domain pair is most likely to mediate a given PPI. Given a pair of interacting
proteins, we determined all possible domain pair combinations and checked
the network for direct or indirect paths from each domain pair to all other
pairs. The domain pair(s) with paths to most of the other domain pairs was

(were) predicted as mediating the interaction. We conﬁrmed this approach by
5-fold cross-validation: we generated a network using 4/5 of the PPIs in our
data and tested the predictions on the rest 1/5. This process was repeated
ﬁve times. We also carried out 3-fold cross-validation. We checked the
statistical signiﬁcance of the results by performing 10 000 iterations assigning
randomly the interacting domain pair for each PPI and checking whether
the assigned domain pair indeed mediates the interaction. The statistical
signiﬁcance was deﬁned as the fraction of random iterations in which the
rate of successfully assigned domain pairs was equal to or exceeded the rate
of successful assignments of domain pairs according to the network path
analysis.

3 RESULTS

3.1 PPI and DDI data

Our analysis is based on the 3DID (Stein et al., 2009) and SNAPPI-
DB (Jefferson et al., 2007) databases of interacting domain pairs
from a variety of organisms (from bacteria to human), derived
from stable protein complexes solved by crystallography (Berman
et al., 2000). Uniting and ﬁltering these databases resulted in 9633
PPIs mediated by 3977 DDIs. Removal of homologous PPIs and
clustering of similar domains following Pfam deﬁnitions of domain
clans further reduced the data to 5024 PPIs mediated by 3005 DDIs
(see Section 2). The distribution of domain pairs by the number of
PPIs they mediate followed a power law (y=3184x_2‘1): many of
the domain pairs mediated only one PPI, while only a few domain
pairs mediated many PPIs (Supplementary Fig. 1). This observation
suggests that domain pairs differ in their use as interaction mediators.

3.2 Preference-relations between domain pairs

To study the relative use of domain pairs as interaction mediators
and their inter-relations, we focused on PPIs that involve at least
one multi-domain protein. We included only multi-domain proteins
for which all domains were solved by crystallography. These
requirements reduced substantially our data to 1206 PPIs. The
domain content of the interacting proteins deﬁnes all the possible
domain pairs that could theoretically mediate the interaction. The
structure of the protein complex determines the actual domain pair(s)
that mediate the interaction and implicitly also the domain pairs
that are not involved in the interaction. We used this information
to deﬁne preference relations between domain pairs: the domain
pair(s) that actually mediate(s) the interaction ‘predominate(s)’ over
domain pairs that do not mediate the interaction. To systematically
analyze these relations, we described them as a network, in which
every node represents a domain pair and directed edges point from
domain pairs that are used to mediate an interaction to the domain
pairs over which they predominate, as exempliﬁed in Figure 1B.
Proteins P1, P2 and P3 in the example presented in Figure 1A
deﬁne a network of six nodes: (a,b), (a,d), (c,b), (c,d), (a,e) and
(c,e). The interaction between P1 and P2 is mediated by domains
a and b, and the interaction between P1 and P3 is mediated by
domains c and e. Therefore, edges point from the node (a,b) to
nodes (a,d), (c,b), (c,d) and from the node (c,e) to nodes (a,b) ,(a,e),
(c,b) (Fig. 1B). Examination of this exemplary network reveals a
transitive pattern in which (c,e) predominates over (c,b) both directly
and indirectly, through (a,b). Thus, in this example the preference
relations of domain pairs as interaction mediators are consistent,
implying an order among domain pairs. Our goal is to test whether
we can identify such consistent relations between domain pairs

in the actual network. This could be revealed by searching the
network of domain pair relations for transitive and cyclic connected
patterns. Transitive patterns are consistent with an order among
domain pairs, while cyclic patterns imply conﬂicts in the preference
relations. High abundance of transitive patterns and avoidance of
cyclic patterns would support an order between domain pairs as
interaction mediators.

We deﬁned the network of domain pair relations based on the
data in the ﬁnal set of 1206 PPIs. This network included 3608
nodes (domain pairs) and 6895 edges (pointing from domain pairs
to domain pairs over which they predominate, see Supplementary
Material). Of note, 393 of the 2545 domain pairs that were
predominated by other domain pairs were shown to mediate
interactions in other solved structures. 142 of the edges were
bi-directional. Systematic analysis of connected patterns in this
network showed that transitive and consistent acyclic patterns
exceeded the cyclic patterns by two orders of magnitude (Fig. lC—G,
Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). The ratio of transitive to cyclic
patterns was substantially higher in the actual network (159.6) than
in random networks (27.9, see Section 2). We veriﬁed that the over-
abundance of the transitive patterns did not result simply from the
node degrees (i.e. the transitivity was observed because the highest
degree node predominated over the other nodes). We tested this
hypothesis and found that the degrees are consistent with only less
than a third of the transitive patterns and therefore cannot account
for the discovered phenomenon.

We repeated the analysis of connected patterns of domain
pairs using three additional networks of domain pair relations, as
summarized in Table 1. Analysis of each of these networks revealed
an order in the use of domain pairs as interaction mediators, and
a high abundance of transitive compared to cyclic patterns. This
emphasizes the robustness of our ﬁndings regardless of the dataset
and the domain deﬁnitions that are used.

3.3 Comparison between preferred and non-preferred
domain pairs

It is intriguing to ﬁnd out what determines the preference relations

between domain pairs and why certain domain pairs are used

for mediating interaction in one context but other domain pairs
predominate over them in another context. One possible explanation
would be that domains capable of interaction, each residing in one
interacting partner, are not engaged in certain PPIs because they
are involved in intra-protein interactions. Therefore, other domain
pairs predominate over them. However, careful examination of the
3891 PDB structures, that are involved in the complexes on which
our analysis was based, revealed that this explanation could hold for
only 98 structures. Another possibility is that the preference relations
stem from certain properties of the domain pairs. To this end,
we carried out a pairwise comparison of certain features between
the preferred domain pairs and the domain pairs over which they
predominate (in every PPI context). We analyzed seven properties
(listed in Table 2), including properties of the domains comprising
the pair, such as their length or phylogenetic age, and properties
related to the interaction, such as the number of contacts in the
interface. For a given property, we computed for each domain pair
in the network (a node) the property value (see Section 2). Next,
for all couples of domain pairs connected by an edge, we tested
by a paired Wilcoxon test whether the differences between their
property values were statistically signiﬁcant. Notably, a domain
pair in one context may be preferred while in another context
another domain pair can predominate over it. Comparison of the
various properties between the preferred domain pairs and the ones
over which they predominate showed highly statistically signiﬁcant
differences (Table 2). However, the biological meaning of these
differences is less clear, as for some properties (such as phylogenetic
age, evolutionary conservation and plasticity) the differences were
very modest, and for others (such as the estimated binding free
energy) the average difference was in the range of the variation
among various PPIs mediated by the same domain pair.

Remarkably, preferred domain pairs exhibit a high tendency
towards homotypic interactions (self-interactions of domains), when
such interactions are possible. Out of the 1206 multi-domain PPIs
in our data, 680 are of homodimers. A homodimer made of a protein
of at least two different domains can dimerize through interactions
that involve the same domain in the interacting proteins (homotypic
interaction) or through interactions that involve different domains
(heterotypic interaction). We found that 630 of the 680 homodimers
(93%) dimerize through at least one homotypic interaction, high
above random expectation (which is 44% based on the domain
content of the homodimers). Furthermore, there are 79 heterodimers
that have the potential of homotypic interactions (the proteins share
at least one common domain), and 50 of those (63%) demonstrate
such interactions, high above random expectation (28%).

3.4 Functional implications of domain pair preferences

The preference of certain domain pairs over others as interaction
mediators is consistent also with the ﬁlnctionality of the complex.
For instance, there are examples in which the functional activity
is embedded in the interface of the preferred domains. This
is exempliﬁed by the prokaryotic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase
dimerization domain (PF09290) and the HMGL-like domain
(PF00682, clan CL0152), present in the DmpG and DmpF proteins
from Pseudomonas sp. Each domain of the preferred pair includes
a separate active site. Upon their interaction, a thin tunnel that
originates in one domain, and ends in the other, allows the transfer of
substrates from one active site to the other (Manjasetty et al., 2003,

Fig. 3. The preference of certain domain pairs over others has functional
implications. (A) Schematic illustration of the interaction between two
double-domain proteins, proteinA (green) and protein B (cyan), where the top
domain pair is preferred and mediates the interaction. Here, the interaction
mediated by the preferred domain pair yields a passage between the domains,
colored in magenta, which is related to the functionality of the complex (e. g.
channeling an electron or tunneling a substrate from a domain in protein A
to a domain in protein B). (B) An actual example for the scenario depicted
in (A): The interaction between DmpG and DmpF (PDB code: lNVM) is
mediated by an HMGL-like domain (green, chain B) and the dimerization
domain of prokaryotic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (cyan, chain A). The
two proteins include separate active sites (magenta), and a tunnel through
which substrates transverse from one to another (residues that compose this
tunnel are represented as a mesh). The picture was created using PyMOL
http://pymol.sourceforgenetl. The identities of the residues that form the
tunnel were calculated using the CASTp program (Dundas at al., 2006).
(C) The homotypic interaction of the Aan domain (the preferred domain
pair) mediates the protein interaction and also positions two helix-turn-helix
motifs in the right distance for binding the DNA site.

Fig. 3A and B). The functional contribution of substrate channeling
to the complex may explain the preference of this particular domain
pair over other alternative domain pairs in mediating the interaction.
This principle is also exempliﬁed in the FAD binding (PF00890,
clan CL0063) and Fer2 (PF00111) domain pair that mediates the
interaction between the FrdA and FrdB proteins. These two proteins
serve as the soluble component of the quinol-fumarate reductase
respiratory complex in Escherichia coli. The catalytic activity of
this complex requires the channeling of electrons from the Fer2
domain to the FAD-binding domain (Iverson et al., 2002).

A similar scenario is exhibited in the APS reductase complex
of Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Fritz et al., 2002), which is another
instance of this domain pair. Collectively, these examples show that
the preference of a certain domain pair in mediating the interaction
in different protein complexes can be explained by the coupling
between this interaction and the ﬁlnction of the protein complex,
as these ﬁlnctions cannot be achieved by any other domain pair
combinations. In other examples, the ﬁlnctional reasoning for the
domain pair preference does not reside in the interaction interface,
but rather in the correct positioning of complex components. Such
a scenario is found, for instance, in LrpA from Pyrococcusﬁtriosus,
which dimerizes through the interaction of two Aan domains
(PF01037, clan CL0032). This protein includes also a helix-tum-
helix motif that interacts with the DNA (Leonard et al., 2001). The
interacting domains place these DNA recognition motifs in a precise

distance from each other, which is required for accurate recognition
of the DNA binding site (Fig. 3C). No other domain combination
can place the DNA recognition motifs in the precise distance and
orientation, and hence this homotypic domain pair interaction is
preferred over all other possible domain pairs in this complex. These
functional implications are consistent also in other complexes where
these domain pairs are found and preferred. Thus, the association
between the preferred domain pairs and ﬁlnctional traits provides yet
another explanation for their repeated use as interaction mediators,
since their interaction aids in deﬁning and positioning the functional
modules of different complexes.

3.5 Prediction of DDIs using the network of domain
pair relations

The analysis of the domain pair relation network revealed
transitivity, implying that the domain pairs present a consistent order.
This suggests that if there are data indicating that (c,e) predominates
over (a,b) and (a,b) predominates over (b,c), it is most probable that
(c,e) predominates also over (b,c), even if there is no such indication
in the current network. This ﬁnding has potential implications for
prediction of the domains that actually mediate an experimentally
veriﬁed PPI. While prediction of interacting domains was not the
aim of this work, we brieﬂy demonstrate how the network of domain
pair relations can be exploited for such predictions. Given a pair of
interacting proteins, we can determine all possible domain pairs and
use the domain pair relation network to check whether there are
direct or indirect paths from one domain pair to all other possible
domain pairs. Such a pair will be predicted as the one mediating
the interaction. We conﬁrmed this approach by analyzing the data
of 1206 PPIs using cross-validation. When determining the network
of domain pair relations based on 4/5 of the protein interactions
in our data and testing the predictions on the remaining 1/5, we
could show that by tracing the paths between domain pairs in this
network, we can correctly predict the domain pairs mediating the
interactions for 73% of the PPIs. This regards PPIs in the test set with
domains that are found in the network based on the training set. This
result is highly statistically signiﬁcant (P <0.0001, see Section 2).
Similar results were obtained when the analysis was carried out
with 3-fold cross-validation. We also examined the accuracy of the
prediction in comparison to random success when the PPIs were
grouped by the numbers of competing domain pairs: We correctly
predicted 85, 71 and 90% of the DDIs when two, three, or four
domain pair combinations, respectively, were possible. This success
rate is high above random expectation (Fig. 4 and Supplementary
Table 2). Similar success rates were obtained for PPIs with more
competing domain pairs.

4 DISCUSSION

The recent accumulation of a vast amount of PPI data has enabled
the study of PPI networks [for review see (Cho et al., 2004; Kiel
et al., 2008; Levy and Pereira—Leal, 2008; Sharan and Ideker, 2006)],
as well as of the inter-relations between PPIs and DDIs (e.g. Chen
and Liu, 2005; Deng et al., 2002; J othi et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2005;
Martin et al., 2005; Qi et al., 2006; Riley et al., 2005; Schlicker et al.,
2007; Sprinzak and Margalit, 2001; Sprinzak et al., 2006), where we
employed network analysis tools to study the preference relations
between domain pairs as interaction mediators. In this network, the

Fig. 4. Prediction of interacting domains. The order in the network of domain
pair relations was used to predict which domain pair mediates a given PPI
(see text). Presented are rates of success in DDI prediction according to
the number of possible domainAiomain combinations in interacting protein
pairs, in comparison to the expected random success rate (e.g. the random
success rate in case of two domain pairs is 50%). The shown data are based on
interacting protein pairs with at most 10 possible domain pairs. We conﬁrmed
this approach by 3-fold and 5-fold cross-validation (shown here). When a
domain pair in the test set does not occur in the network of domain pair
relations (training set) the interaction cannot be predicted. Success rates
are therefore described for those domain pairs that appear in both the test
and training sets. The random success rates were calculated according to
the number of potential domain pairs in PPIs, taking into consideration the
number of domain pairs that actually mediate the interaction.

nodes are domain pairs and edges point from domain pairs mediating
the interaction to all possible domain pairs in the complex, over
which they predominate. Analysis of this network revealed an order
between domain pairs, which was consistent across various protein
pairs carrying the corresponding domains. Of note, the relatively
small number of solved complexes implies that the network of
domain pair relations is of low connectivity, since many couples
of domain pairs may never appear in the same complex, disenabling
an edge between them. Accordingly, this network is composed of
many subnetworks of connected components, each showing a partial
view of the domain pair relations. Thus, the phenomenon that we
have identiﬁed, of order of the domain pairs by their preferential use
as interaction mediators, is re-discovered in many subnetworks of
domain pair relation networks. However, in the context of the whole
network, due to the missing edges, this order should be regarded
as partial order. Thus, our analysis shows that not only there are
domain pairs that mediate PPIs and others that do not, but also the
ones capable of mediating interaction can be (partially) ordered by
their suitability to this task.

The main discovery of our study, that there is an order of domain
pairs as interaction mediators, raises additional questions as to the
domain pair properties that may underlie the revealed preferences.
Conceivably such preferences might develop through evolution, and
therefore we asked whether the preferred pairs are more ancient
than the ones over which they predominate and whether they show
higher plasticity that allows them to accommodate in various protein
contexts. These properties showed very modest differences between
the compared domain pairs (although highly statistically signiﬁcant),

pointing to tendencies that might be ﬁlrther substantiated with
accumulation of more data of interacting proteins. Alternatively,
as we found in our analysis of functional implications, it may be
that the preference relations are the result of local solutions to the
functional constraints of each protein complex. Since these solutions
differ between different complexes, speciﬁc properties might have
implications in only subsets of the data, and therefore we observed
only subtle tendencies when applying the analysis of the properties
to the whole data.

Our prominent ﬁnding—that the preferred domain pairs show
high abundance of homotypic interactions—is consistent with
previous observations reporting that homotypic interactions are
statistically signiﬁcantly over-represented in the data of DDIs,
especially among DDIs conserved in various organisms (Itzhaki
et al., 2006). Furthermore, our ﬁnding that, when possible,
homotypic interactions are preferred also for heterodimerization
further supports the advantage suggested for homotypic interactions
in stabilizing protein complexes (Andre et al., 2008; Lukatsky et al.,
2006). These advantages include a duplicated effect for stabilizing
mutations and lower mean energy of the interfaces compared to that
of heterotypic interactions (Lukatsky et al., 2006). Another hint at
the advantage of homotypic interactions is the relative abundance
of functional sites found at the interface of homodimers (Davis and
Sali, 2010). In addition, it was demonstrated that early in evolution
a bias towards very low energy complexes may have driven the
selection of symmetrical structures (Andre et al., 2008). It is possible
that following such considerations early in evolution certain domains
adjusted themselves for self interaction. Such domains could
later recruit other domains to create multi-domain proteins whose
interactions are mediated via the homotypic interactions (Bomberg-
Bauer et al., 2005). This conjecture is ﬁlrther supported by our
ﬁnding that the same homotypic domain interactions mediating
multi-domain PPIs are also found in homodimers of single domain
proteins (data not shown).

The high abundance of homotypic interactions among the
preferred domain pairs may raise the concern that the order that we
have identiﬁed is simply a reﬂection of the advantage of homotypic
interactions. To test this, we repeated the analysis including only
heterodimers that do not contain domains capable of self-interaction
(data not shown). This analysis again identiﬁed a consistent order
between domain pairs, implying that it is not due to the preference
of homotypic interactions.

Our analysis, while based on the currently available limited
dataset of structurally derived DDIs in multi-domain PPIs, provides
intriguing insights into the preference relations between domain
pairs. The order that we identiﬁed is robust and is revealed when
using datasets based on various systems of domain deﬁnitions (Finn
et al., 2008; Murzin et al., 1995), and when analyzing extensions
or sub-sections of the datasets (Table 1), suggesting that it will
persist when more DDI data become available. At present, the order
that we identiﬁed is partial because many parts of the network of
domain pair relations are disconnected due to missing data. As more
and more protein complexes of multiple domain combinations will
be solved, the repertoire of domain pair relations will be enriched
and the preference relation network might become more connected.
This will enable improved prediction of DDIs based on the network
structure and a deeper understanding as to the molecular principles
that make some domain pairs more suitable than others for mediating
interactions.

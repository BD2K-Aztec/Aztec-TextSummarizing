ABSTRACT

Summary: CePa is an R package aiming to find significant pathways
through network topology information. The package has several
advantages compared with current pathway enrichment tools. First,
pathway node instead of single gene is taken as the basic unit when
analysing networks to meet the fact that genes must be constructed
into complexes to hold normal functions. Second, multiple network
centralities are applied simultaneously to measure importance of
nodes from different aspects to make a full view on the biological
system. CePa extends standard pathway enrichment methods,
which include both over-representation analysis procedure and
gene-set analysis procedure. CePa has been evaluated with high per-
formance on real-world data, and it can provide more information
directly related to current biological problems.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biological pathways are basic integrated circuits to actualize spe-
ciﬁc biological process in regular biological system. Identifying
signiﬁcant pathways in which genes are perturbed is important
for researchers to focus on the most relevant sets of genes.
Finding signiﬁcant pathways from expression data is a
fundamental task in bioinformatics analysis, which is always
named pathway enrichment analysis or gene-set enrichment
analysis.

Currently, there are two categories of methodologies on this
subject: over-representation analysis (ORA) and gene-set ana-
lysis (GSA). The former takes a list of differentially expressed
genes and tries to find which pathways are enriched in the gene
list compared with background genes by a 2x 2 contingency
table (Khatri and Draghici, 2005). One representative tool is
DAVID (Huang et al., 2009). The GSA procedure uses the
whole-gene expression matrix from microarray experiments, by
ﬁrst calculating gene-level statistics in a pathway and then inte-
grating into a pathway-level score (Ackermann and Strimmer,

2009). ORA procedure is convenient for microarray data with
few replications, and GSA procedure can generate more reliable
conclusions on the analysis.

However, current standard enrichment methods are limited for
revealing signiﬁcant pathways because genes are treated identical
in these procedures. It should be noted that pathways are repre-
sented as networks, thus importance of genes varies from differ-
ent Views of network structure. Currently, there are only a few
works considering pathway topology. The first category is to use
topological information through a global network, which is
always constructed from the entire genome (Glaab et al.,
2010). The drawback is that such global network, e.g. con-
structed from public proteiniprotein interaction database or pre-
dicted interactions, would contain a lot of noise and is also not
speciﬁc to biological conditions. The second category is to design
a pathway score to cover certain aspect of genes (e.g. genes are
called important when they locate in the upstream of pathways,
or when they directly regulate many other genes) (Draghici et al.,
2007). The limitation is that because of the complexity of biolo-
gical pathways, such single measurement cannot fully capture the
characteristics of different genes.

Here, we proposed the R package CePa that extends standard
gene-set enrichment methods (both of ORA and GSA proced-
ure) with pathway topology information. In our previous work,
we have proved ORA extension shows better performance than
the standard one (Gu et al., 2012). Our method has two advan-
tages. First, we take nodes rather than genes as the basic units
when analysing pathways. It is to the fact that genes must be
assembled into complexes to achieve normal biological functions.
Also, one single gene may locate in different nodes in real bio-
logical systems. According to our previous study on an existing
pathway database (Gu et al., 2012), there are ~50% genes
located in multiple nodes, and 50% nodes contain more than
one gene. Second, we use network centralities in the pathway
as the weight of nodes and do not set a ﬁxed measurement for
the importance of genes, but we allow multiple choices tested
simultaneously. This feature enables users to look at the
system from multiple aspects, thus users can make more
complete conclusions on current biological problems. The
package is designed to be ﬂexible so that it can implement
many current gene-set enrichment methods and various central-
ity measurements. Finally, CePa generates informative and
interactive report for the analysis and also supports parallel
computing.

2 APPROACH

2.1 ORA extension

We ﬁrst mapped differentially expressed genes to differentially af-
fected nodes. That is, if any member gene in a node is differential,
the node is called differentially affected. Such a rule is to the fact
that a complex loses its normal function as long as any component
gene is abnormal. The pathway score is deﬁned as the summation
of weights of differentially affected nodes in the pathway

S: iwidi 
i=1

where s is the pathway score, w,- is the centrality of the ith node
and d,- is a binary variable to identify whether the ith node is
differentially affected.

The detailed evaluation of ORA extension can be found in our
previous work (Gu et al., 2012).

2.2 GSA extension

In standard GSA procedure, there are always gene-level statistics
to combine into a pathway-level score for a single pathway. Here,
we ﬁrst extend gene-level statistic to node-level statistic. If a node
in the pathway only contains one gene, the gene’s expression
vector is set as the node’s expression vector. And if node in path-
ways comprises multiple genes, first take the largest principle com-
ponent according to the member genes’ expression value, and the
vector for the component is set as the node’s expression vector.
The node-level statistic d is then calculated from this vector. For a
certain pathway, the score for GSA extension is calculated as

S =fIW - d) (2)

where s is the pathway score, w is the centrality vector and d is
the node-level statistic vector for the pathway nodes. The trans-
formation function facts on the vectorized production of w and
d. In Equation (2), d is frequently taken as t—Values of the node
expression vectors. CePa provides options for three node-level
statistics: t—Value, absolute t—Value and square of t—Value, in which
the latter two options are recommended because they can cap-
ture the both up- and downregulation in the pathway.
Nevertheless, user-deﬁned d can also be applied in the package,
such as signal-to-noise ratio or other robust methods. The trans-
formation function f provided in CePa includes max, min,
median, mean, sum and rank statistic. Similarly, self-defined
transformation of f is also allowed in CePa. With such ﬂexible
design for the package, many current gene-set enrichment ana-
lysis methods, such as SAM-GS (Dinu et al., 2007) and max-
mean (Efron and Tibshirani, 2007) can be extended.

The GSA extension has been evaluated on a p53 dataset.
Compared with standard GSA, CePa can ﬁnd more significant
pathways and reveal more details about the key regulations in
the pathways (see Supplementary Data).

3 IMPLEMENTATION

3.1 Pathway database

CePa has integrated pathways from Pathway Interaction
Database (PID) (Schaefer et al., 2009). PID provides four

pathway catalogues: NCI-Nature, BioCarta, Reactome and
KEGG (see PID’s website and FTP site). The pathway data
are parsed from extensible mark-up language (XML) format
ﬁle and can be used directly by data (PID . db) in the package.
Each catalogue contains at least three components: a pathway
list in which pathways are represented by a list of interactions; an
interaction list in which each interaction is composed of an input
node and an output node; and a mapping list that provides
mappings from nodes to genes. We provide a parsing script avail-
able at http://mcube.nju.edu.cn/jwang/lab/soft/cepa/ for users
who want to parse other versions of PID data. The detailed
parsing procedure can be found in the Supplementary Material
and the package Vignette.

3.2 Functions

The usage for CePa is designed to be simple. All the calculation
can be achieved by the function cepa.all (), which means
applying the CePa algorithm on a list of pathway and multiple
centralities. The function is wrapper of both ORA extension and
GSA extension. It chooses corresponding procedure according to
the arguments speciﬁed. The example codes are as follows.

res.ora <— cepa.all (dif = dif, bk 2 bk,
pc 2 PID.db$NCI)

res . gsa <— cepa . all (mat = expr, label = label ,
pc 2 PID.db$NCI)

In the example, if the arguments contain gene lists (e. g. dif for
the differential gene list and bk for the background gene list), the
calculation is sent to functions doing ORA extension. Although if
the arguments contain an expression matrix (mat) and a pheno-
type label (label), the GSA extension will be evoked.

The plot ( ) function provides rich Visualizations for the
result. It generates different ﬁgures according to the arguments
speciﬁed. First, it draws heatmap of P-Values/FDRs of all path-
ways or those only signiﬁcant under several centrality measure-
ments (Fig. 1A). Second, it draws the network graph of a certain
pathway (Fig. 1B). Third, it draws null distributions of
node-level statistics and pathway score for a single pathway
under speciﬁc centrality measurement (Fig. 1C and D).

As calculations on a list of pathways are independent in the
analysis, CePa also implements the algorithm parallel through
function cepa. all .parallel ( ) with dependence of snow
package.

Finally, CePa can generate an informative report in HTML
format through report () function. The report includes tables
and ﬁgures that fully describe the results of the analysis.
Additionally, pathways can be Visualized interactively by
Cytoscape Web (Lopes et al., 2010) in the report. An example
of the report can be found at http://mcube.nju.edu.cn/jwang/lab/
soft/cepa/p53test/.

3.3 Centralities

Centralities are calculated by igraph package. By default, the
cepa.all () function uses six centralities: equal weight
(deﬁned as 1 for all nodes), in-degree, out-degree, betweenness,
in-reach and out-reach. The latter two centralities measure
whether the node locates in the upstream or downstream of

Abstract

Summary: We describe Manta, a method to discover structural variants and indels from next gener—
ation sequencing data. Manta is optimized for rapid germline and somatic analysis, calling structural
variants, medium—sized indels and large insertions on standard compute hardware in less than a
tenth of the time that comparable methods require to identify only subsets ofthese variant types: for
example NA12878 at 50x genomic coverage is analyzed in less than 20min. Manta can discover and
score variants based on supporting paired and split—read evidence, with scoring models optimized
for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor—normal sample pairs.
Call quality is similar to or better than comparable methods, as determined by pedigree consistency
of germline calls and comparison of somatic calls to COSMIC database variants. Manta consistently
assembles a higher fraction of its calls to base—pair resolution, allowing for improved downstream
annotation and analysis of clinical significance. We provide Manta as a community resource to facili—
tate practical and routine structural variant analysis in clinical and research sequencing scenarios.
Availability and implementation: Manta is released under the open—source GPLV3 license. Source
code, documentation and Linux binaries are available from https://github.com/lllumina/manta.

1 Introduction

Whole genome and enrichment sequencing is increasingly used for
discovery of inherited and somatic genome variation in clinical con-
texts, however tools for rapid discovery of structural variants (SVs)
and indels in this scenario are limited. We address this gap with
Manta, a novel method for accurate discovery and scoring of SVs,
medium-sized indels and large insertions in a unified and rapid pro-
cess. Manta discovers variants from a sequencing assay’s paired and
split-read mapping information using an efficient parallel workflow.
Many advanced structural variant methods are available which focus

on research and population genomics (Layer et (11., 2014; Rausch
et (11., 2012; Sindi et (11., 2012; Ye et (11., 2009). However, none to our
knowledge combine as many variant types into a rapid workﬂow
focused on individual or small sets of related samples. Per its focus on
clinical pipelines, Manta provides a complete solution for discovery,
assembly and scoring using only a reference genome and alignments
from any standard read mapper. It provides scoring models for germ-
line analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor-
normal sample pairs, with additional applications under development
for RNA-Seq, (16 1101/0 variants, and unmatched tumors. We describe

Structural variant calling with Manta

Manta’s methods and compare with representative tools to demon—
strate high variant call quality with dramatically reduced compute
cost.

2 Methods

2.1 Workflow summary

Manta’s workflow is designed for high parallelization on individual or
small sets of samples. It operates in two phases: first a graph of all
breakend associations within the genome is built, then the components
of this graph are processed for variant hypothesis generation, assembly,
scoring and VCF reporting. The breakend graph contains edges be—
tween any genomic regions where evidence of a long range adjacency
exists, indel assembly regions are denoted in this scheme as self—edges.
The graph does not express specific variant hypotheses so it is very com—
pact, and can be constructed from segments of the genome in parallel.
Following graph construction, individual edges (or larger subgraphs)
are analyzed for variants in parallel. Each edge is analyzed to find im—
precise variant hypotheses, for which variant reads are assembled and
aligned back to the genome. Assembly is attempted for all cases, but
is not required to report a variant. All paired and split—read evidence
is consolidated to a quality score under either a germline or somatic
variant model, and filtration metrics complement this quality score to
improve call precision. For ease of use, Manta automates estimation of
insert size distribution and exclusion of high depth reference compres—
sion regions. Details of all workflow components are provided in
Supplementary Methods.

2.2 Variant call evaluation

We assess accuracy of germline calls by running variant callers on
all members of CEPH pedigree 1463, selecting for calls with pedi—
gree—consistent genotypes and evaluating each caller on one pedigree
member (NA12878) against the pedigree—consistent call set. To find
pedigree—consistent calls and provide a relative recall comparison for
Manta, we select a standard recognized caller in each variant class:
Pindel (Ye et al., 2009) for indels and Delly (Rausch et al., 2012) for
SVs. Calls from each representative method are used to establish the
pedigree—consistent call set together with Manta’s. For somatic calls
we also use Delly as a standard benchmark and compare calls from
both methods for the HCC1954 breast cancer cell line compared to
its matched normal cell line (HCC1954BL). These calls are com—
pared to somatic variant entries for HCC1954 in COSMIC v70
(Forbes et al., 2015). Full details of the evaluation procedure are
included in Supplementary Methods.

3 Results

We describe NA12878 variant call performance in the top portion
of Table 1, comparing the results of each method to pedigree—con—
sistent calls for this sample (see Methods). The first section describes
large deletions and duplications, showing that Manta’s results are
competitive overall and have a somewhat higher recall (or higher
rate of pedigree consistency due to correct genotyping). Manta calls
consistently show a higher fraction of calls agreeing with the pedi—
gree—consistent set which also have breakends assembled to base—
pair resolution. For deletions and insertions smaller than 500 bases,
the next section of Table 1 reiterates the large SV pattern of strong
performance, with a trend towards higher recall across these smaller
indel variant classes.

Somatic call performance for the HCC1954/HCC1954BL tumor/
normal sample pair is described in the final portion of Table 1,

comparing each method’s variant calls to COSMIC variant entries for
HCC1954 (see Section 2). In this case, the truth set does not reflect a
complete catalog of somatic variants for the cell line, however it does
provide a useful relative precision estimate reflecting enrichment for
known variants. Here we observe strong performance for Manta calls
across all variant types with a trend towards a greater fraction of true
calls assembled to base—pair resolution, consistent with germline vari—
ant observations.

Table 2 summarizes runtime and memory cost for each variant
caller, benchmarked in both parallel and serial modes to show work—
load distribution and methods efficiency. By either of these runtime
or memory metrics we observe that Manta has substantially lower
compute cost and turnaround time, while providing coverage of
more variant types. We note that Delly is designed to parallelize pri—
marily across, instead of within, samples, so the parallel test reflects
a limited use of all server cores. When Manta is restricted to provide
variant call coverage similar to Delly (variants 300 bases and larger),
observed compute cost is even lower, further highlighting the effi—
ciency of Manta’s implementation relative to current methods.

Manta’s approach is sufficiently flexible to support several types
of sequencing assays. The primary focus for rapid analysis and
large—scale SV calling has been whole genome sequencing, but
Manta is routinely used to analyze exome and other enrichment—
based targeted sequencing assays. The method is not designed for
targeted amplicon sequencing but successful results have been re—
ported. We additionally note that Manta has been extensively opti—
mized to handle the shorter fragment lengths and higher chimera

rates found in highly degraded FFPE samples as part of an ongoing
focus on clinical sequencing workflows.

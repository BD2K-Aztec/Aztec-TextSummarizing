ABSTRACT

Result: We have developed miREvaI 2.0, an online tool that can sim-
ultaneously search up to 100 sequences for novel microRNAs
(miRNAs) in multiple organisms. miREvaI 2.0 uses multiple published
in silico approaches to detect miRNAs in sequences of interest. This
tool can be used to discover miRNAs from DNA sequences or to val-
idate candidates from sequencing data.

1 INTRODUCTION

microRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22-nt non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)
that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of target
mRNAs. Although recent advances in sequencing technology
allow a comprehensive analysis of expressed small RNAs, includ-
ing miRNAs, distinguishing miRNAs from other RNA mol-
ecules within sequencing data remains difﬁcult (Ritchie et al.,
2012). Moreover, sequencing data will not detect miRNAs spe-
ciﬁc to other tissue types and may not be available for partially
sequenced genomes.

miREval 2.0 detects novel miRNAs from input DNA or RNA
sequences using multiple bioinformatics approaches such as pre-
dicted secondary structure, phylogenetic conservation and
shadowing and positional clustering. It also allows users to Visu-
alize RNA molecules in the sequence of interest that may be
mistaken for miRNAs. miREval 2.0 also displays transcription
factor (TF) binding sites that may regulate miRNAs in the input
sequence and overlapping mRNA transcripts.

Improvements over our previous version of miREval (Ritchie
et al., 2008) include a bigger genome database (31 species instead
of 10), multiple input sequences per enquiry, improved perform-
ance of the secondary structure prediction and parallelization to
increase the speed of each analysis by over 10-f01d. Results are
now displayed in a circle graph to allow for a more compact
Visualization of long input sequences.

New features include phylogenetic footprinting to discover
miRNAs that are speciﬁc to a given clade, the display of RNA

molecules from rFam that may be mistaken for miRNAs and of
TF binding sites that may regulate miRNAs in the input
sequence. miREval 2.0 offers more features than most current
prediction tools and displays high performance scores
(Supplementary Table S1).

2 METHODS

miREval accepts up to 100 sequences of DNA or RNA in FASTA
format. Comprehensive analysis is available for 31 species; partial ana-
lysis, including secondary structure prediction and alignment to known
miRNAs, is still available for other species.

2.1 miRNA prediction

S VM prediction of miRNAs: Support vector machines (SVM) are an ef-
ﬁcient machine learning technique used to predict miRNAs (Xue et al.,
2005). Our SVM is trained on 57 features including secondary structure,
free energy and sequence composition (Supplementary Table S2). The
positive dataset used to train the SVM is a collection of miRNA precur-
sors from miRBase v20 across 15 vertebrates. The negative training set
contains sequences from exonic regions of our 31 available genomes and
ncRNAs randomly selected from rFam. Training our SVM on rFam
ncRNAs allows miREval 2.0 to distinguish miRNA hairpins from hair-
pins in other ncRNAs. Tests run on 715 known miRNA precursors and
715 exonic fragments from mouse found the following performance rates:
precision 0.92, accuracy 0.91, speciﬁcity 0.92 and sensitivity 0.89. For
sequences longer than average miRNA precursors, miREval 2.0 uses a
sliding window with a 10-bp step and size equal to the average length of
miRNAs for the input species [69 (Wallaby)-148 bp (Tasmanian Devil)].

Phylogenetic conservation: miRNAs often show evolutionarily con-
served patterns in their precursor regions. The conservation of a typical
miRNA is higher at the two stems of the hairpin and drops to a low level
toward the loop region (Berezikov et al., 2005). miREval 2.0 uses con-
servation scores for alignments of 45 vertebrate genomes (10 genomes in
the previous version) with the enquiry species from UCSC. These scores
are calculated by PHAST (Siepel et al., 2006) to give conservation at base
resolution.

Phylogenetic shadowing (new): Phylogenetic shadowing uses multiple
alignments of closely related species to discover functional elements
(Blanchette and Tompa, 2002). Phylogenetic shadowing can pick up
clade-speciﬁc miRNAs that would be overlooked using phylogenetic con-
servation. Phylogenetic shadowing scores are calculated in the same
manner as conservation scores except that multiple (>5) related species
are used instead of distant species.

miRNA clustering (improved): Sewer et al. and Marco found that
miRNAs often clustered together (Marco et al., 2013; Sewer et al.,
2005). This property can be used to enhance the accuracy of miRNA

prediction. miREval searches 1000 bp around the enquiry sequence for
miRNAs (miRBase v20) that cluster with the enquiry sequence.

2.2 Genomic information

If the user selects one of the 31 available species, miREval provides add-
itional genomic information.

TF binding sites and transcripts (new): miRNAs are directly tran-
scribed from DNA by RNA polymerase II or III (Lee et al., 2004) or
co-transcribed with mRNA transcripts (Marco et al., 2013). Identiﬁcation
of nearby TF binding sites or known transcripts that overlap with the
sequence of interest may aid miRNA prediction (Marco et al., 2013) and
provide insight into miRNA regulation. Transcript lists were downloaded
from UCSC, and score matrices of TF binding sites were built from the
JASPAR database (Portales-Casamar et al., 2010). miREval 2.0 com-
pares the coordinates of enquiry sequences with transcript list and uses
the FIMO tool (Grant et al., 2011) to ﬁnd TF binding sites 1000 bp
ﬂanking the enquiry or ﬂanking any mRNA transcript overlapping the
enquiry.

Overlap with ncRNAs (new): Some ncRNAs have hairpin-like struc-
tures that may confound secondary structure prediction. miREval 2.0

displays transcripts from rFam that overlap the enquiry sequence and
displays possible miRNA-like hairpins within them.

3 RESULTS

miREval 2.0 now supports multiple sequences per enquiry.
Before displaying the final result page, it displays a heatmap of
all of its features for each input sequence (Fig. 1A). This enables
the user to Visualize and select sequences with the most interest-
ing features. Predicted hairpins are Visualized using Varna V3.9
(http://Varna-gui.software.informer.com/) (Fig. 1B). miREval 2.0
displays the final output in a circle graph using Circos 0.64
(Krzywinski et al., 2009) (Fig. 1C). Users may hover their
mouse over the graph to display more detailed information for
each feature. miREval is fully compatible with Chrome, Firefox
and IE after version 8.0.

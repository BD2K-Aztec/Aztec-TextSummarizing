Abstract

Motivation: miRNAs play crucial roles in human diseases and newly discovered could be targeted
by small molecule (SM) drug compounds. Thus, the identification of small molecule drug com—
pounds (SM) that target dysregulated miRNAs in cancers will provide new insight into cancer biol—
ogy and accelerate drug discovery for cancer therapy.

Results: In this study, we aimed to develop a novel computational method to comprehensively
identify associations between SMs and miRNAs. To this end, exploiting multiple molecular inter—
action databases, we first established an integrated SM—miRNA association network based on
690 561 SM to SM interactions, 291 600 miRNA to miRNA associations, as well as 664 known SM to
miRNA targeting pairs. Then, by performing Random Walk with Restart algorithm on the integrated
network, we prioritized the miRNAs associated to each of the SMs. By validating our results utiliz—
ing an independent dataset we obtained an area under the ROC curve greater than 0.7.
Furthermore, comparisons indicated our integrated approach significantly improved the identifica—
tion performance of those simple modeled methods. This computational framework as well as the
prioritized SM—miRNA targeting relationships will promote the further developments of targeted
cancertherapies.

miRNAs are non—coding small RNAs with post transcriptional regu—
latory functions and are dysregulated in most of human cancers
(Volinia et (11., 2006; Wu et (11., 2007). Approximately half of the
known miRNAs are located in cancer—associated genome regions or
fragile sites (Liu et (11., 2004; Lagana et (11., 2010). Cumulative stud—
ies demonstrated that the mature miRNAs as well as their precursors
could be targeted by small molecular drugs (Liu et (11., 2008;
Thomas and Hergenrother, 2008; Bose et (11., 2012; Srinivasan
et (11., 2013; Hesse and Arenz, 2014). A recent clinical trial revealed

122 which plays important roles in the duplication of hepatitis C
viruses (Lanford et (11., 2010).

Several approaches then were developed to investigate the inter—
actions between small molecules and miRNA. Structure—based
approaches, such as molecular docking, is useful for identifying
small molecular compounds that target miRNAs (Zhang et (11.,
2010) with known 3D structures. Identifying associations between
small molecules and miRNAs in 23 cancers types and Alzheimer
have been established based on transcriptional responses of small

molecule and miRNA perturbation (Jiang et (11., 2012; Meng et (11.,
2013). Jamal et al employed a chemical descriptors— and machine
learning—based method, which is the first and most comprehensive
computational analysis to predict small molecule modulators of
miRNA (Jamal et (11., 2012).

Meanwhile, based on the hypothesis that similar small molecules
tend to target similar proteins, several computational systems biol—
ogy approaches based on large scale molecular networks have been
applied to identify molecular interactions related to small molecules
(Van Laarhoven et (11., 2011; Alaimo et (11., 2013).

In this study, taking together the advantages of above structure—
or experiment—based methods and the genome—wide exploration of
biological network based approaches, we firstly apply network re—
trieval methods on integrated biological interactions to predict small
molecule—miRNA associations for understanding miRNA binding
activities of small molecules. This study provides researchers a prac—
tical method to identify the biological regulations of small molecules
and will facilitate the further discovery of chemical drug on miRNA
mediated human complex diseases.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Datasets

2.1.1 Small molecule drugs

FDA—approved small molecule or drug compounds (SM) were ob—
tained from SM2miR (Liu et (11., 2013), DrugBank (Knox et (11.,
2011) and PubChem (Wang et (11., 2009). After filtering redundant
annotations across databases and many—to—one SM—miRNA relation—
ships, we finally obtained a total of 1338 SMs including 101 SMs
from SM2miR, 1291 FDA—approved SM drugs with DrugBank an—
notations and 1124 SM drugs from PubChem. 1077 SMs have both
annotations in DrugBank and PubChem, 214 SMs unique annotated
in DrugBank and 47 SMs identically annotated in PubChem
(Supplementary Table S1).

2.1.2 miRNAs with phenotype annotations

miRNAs were compiled from the SM2miR, HMDD (Lu et (11.,
2008), miR2Disease (Jiang et (11., 2009) and PhenomiR databases
(Ruepp et (11., 2010). Then, they were matched with their precursors
using the miRBase database (release 20). After removing deprecated
miRNAs, a total of 571 miRNAs were left for further analyses
(Supplementary Table S2).

2.1.3 A compendium of known SM-miRNA targeting pairs

A collection of 664 SM—miRNA targeting pairs reported by
SM2miR (Version 1) were used as seeds for Random Walk with
Restart (RWR) algorithms. Another set of 78 newly updated SM—
miRNA targeting pairs were used as an independent testing set for
validation (Supplementary Table S3).

2.2 Similarity calculation and integration

2.2.1 Integrating SM—SM similarities to establish SM-SM interaction
networks

Previous drug discovery studies demonstrated that similarities based
on chemical structures, side effects, targeting functions and pheno—
types are powerful computational tools to identify the associations
among SMs for drug discoveries (Gottlieb et (11., 2011; Chen et (11.,
2012a, b; Takarabe et (11., 2012; Chen et (11., 2013). In this study, we
employed four commonly used similarity measurements which are
based on side effect (Gottlieb et (11., 2011), functional consistency
(Lv et (11., 2012), chemical structure (Hattori et (11., 2003) and

Supplementary File). Then, to reduce the bias of each similarity
measurement and facilitate the discovery of novel interactions, we
used a weighed combination strategy to integrate the similarities. As
shown in Equation (1), for each of the SM pairs, the integrated simi—
larity 53 was defined as follows:

SSD, SE, SSC and Sg indicate the similarity measurement based on indi—
cation phenotype, functional consistency, chemical structure and
side effect, respectively. The default value [3,- : 1 assigns the same
weight to each separated similarities. After integration, we identified
690 5 61 SM—SM interactions (Supplementary Table S4), which in—
crease our capability of finding novel SM—miRNA interactions.
Also, the distribution of the integrated interactions shows a typical
pattern of scale—free networks (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004; Albert,
2005; Rai et (11., 2014) (Supplementary Fig. S1).

2.2.2 Measuring similarities between miRNA and miRNA to
establish miRNA-miRNA association networks

As shown in Figure 1, we employed two previous defined measure—
ments, based on functional consistency (Lv et (11., 2012) and pheno—
type of indications (Gottlieb et (11., 201 1), to determine raw miRNA—
miRNA associations (Supplementary File). We integrated the two
measurements to reduce the bias and extend the network for dis—
covering novel miRNA—miRNA associations. As shown in Equation
(2), for each of the miRNA pairs, the integrated associations SM was
defined as:

SE, and S}; indicate the indication phenotype— and functional
consistency —based association respectively. For SM—SM interactions,
or,- : 1 was set as the default value. A total of 291600 miRNA—
miRNA interactions were identified after integrating
(Supplementary Table S5).

2.3 RWR method for the integrated network with two
types of nodes

The RWR algorithm is derived from graph theory and simulates a
random move from the seed node(s) to their immediate neighbors or
stay at the current node(s) according to the probability transition

matrix of the integrated network. A,,- represents the probability of
getting from one miRNA (SM) to another miRNA (SM) or from one
miRNA (SM) to a SM (miRNA). A E (0, 1) is a jumping probability
from the miRNA network to the SM network (and vice versa) which
indicates the reinforcement between the two networks (Li and Patra,

2010). After some steps, the steady probability poo :

3 Results

3.1 Performing improved RWR to prioritize SM
targeting miRNAs

RWR was used to predict associations between SMs and their biolo—
gical targets (Chen et (11., 2012b). We constructed SM—SM and
miRNA—miRNA association networks based on integrating their as—
sociation measures. Using known SM—miRNA targeting relation—
ships, we merged the two networks into one multiple layer network
(Fig. 1). As shown in Figure 1, some of the SMs have known
miRNA targets (illustrated with red arrow in Fig. 1) while others do
not (illustrated with blue arrow in Fig. 1). Notably, 792 (out of 831,
95%) SMs have no validated targets according to SM2miR. In effort
to exploit the RWR method on integrated networks for both SMs
with/without validated targets, we classified the SMs into two
groups and employed different strategies to predict their miRNA
targets. The 39 SMs with known miRNA targets were grouped into
the first type of SMs (SM—I), in which eight SMs have only one
known miRNA target. 792 SMs lacking validated miRNA targets
were grouped into the second type of SMs (SM—II). RWR requires a
set of seed nodes to initiate the analysis and assign probability scores
(scoring the relationship) to all nodes (including the seed nodes) ac—
cording to the topological structure of the network. Accordingly, for
each SM, the SM and its known miRNA targets were set as seed
nodes in SM—I while only the SM was set as seed node in SM—II.
RWR was then utilized to predict the miRNA targets of each SM
based on assigned probability scores (see Supplementary File).

3.2 Performance evaluation and independent validation

Cross validation is essential for validating the performance of pre—
diction methods. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC)
plots the true (sensitivity) versus false positive rate (1—specificity) at
different cutoffs (Yang et (11., 2014) and area under curve (AUC) of
ROC is commonly used to represent the results of cross validation.
We utilized an improved leave—one—out cross validation (LOOCV)
(Chen et (11., 2012c) to validate our method on integrated networks.
As described, different seed node(s) settings were utilized in predict—
ing miRNA targets for SM—I and SM—II.

To validate SMs in SM—I, as illustrated in Figure 2A, one known
SM—miRNA association was excluded and the SM to be validated
along with remaining known targets of the SM were set as seed
nodes. The rank of the excluded miRNA (colored in red) as deter—
mined by the RWR probability scores, and the AUC of ROC was
then calculated as the index to score the recovery capability of the
excluded known SM—miRNA association. The validation set com—
prised a set of 31 SMs in which each SM has at least two known
miRNA targets (not including the excluded miRNA for which there
should be at least one known target set as seed node(s)). These 31
SMs involved 656 known SM—miRNA associations. As a result, the
AUC of 14 (45%) SMs is greater than 0.9, the AUC of 22 (71%)
SMs is greater than 0.8, and the AUC of 26 (84%) SMs is greater
than 0.7 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Due to insufficient known
miRNA targets for SMs in SM—II, LOOCV cannot be performed dir—
ectly validate the recovery capability. However, by using SMs from
SM—I but excluding all the known miRNA targets, we can establish
an RWR—defined initial seed node for SM—II. As illustrated in
Figure 2B, all the known SM—miRNA associations for the validating
SM were excluded, and only the SM itself was set as the seed node.
Then, by using the ranks of excluded miRNAs (colored in red) as
determined by RWR, AUCs were calculated for each SM. A set of
39 SMs in which each SM has at least one known miRNA target
comprised the validation dataset. The AUC of 11 (28%) SMs is
greater than 0.9, the AUC of 18 (46%) SMs is greater than 0.8, and
the AUC of 27 (69%) SMs is greater than 0.7 (Supplementary Fig.
S2). The overall ROC predicting all of the SM—miRNA associations
for the two types of SMs indicate that our method achieved satisfac—
tory sensitivity and specificity (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Further, we applied the evaluation method to an independent
testing set from recently updated SM—miRNA associations (6 SM

were included which had 78 SM—miRNA interactions) to further
evaluate the performance of this method (Supplementary Table S3).
The results are shown in Supplementary Table S6. The AUC values
of the newly found SMs CID: 5816 and CID: 2662 were 0.837 and
0.82, respectively. Moreover, four other SM AUCs were higher than
or near 0.7. Thus, we propose that our prediction method is effective
for finding potential miRNA targets of SMs.

3.3 Performance of identified SM—miRNA associations
We generated SM—miRNA interactions randomly in silico to evalu—
ate whether or not the results of our prediction method were likely
to be obtained by chance. To compare the recovery capability in
SM—I we maintained the SM—SM and miRNA—miRNA similarity net—
works and randomly assigned a total of 656 miRNAs as the targets
of 31 randomly selected SMs that have at least two miRNA targets.
Our method and LOOCV procedures as described in Figure 2A
were then performed to generate AUC values for scoring the recov—
ery capability of the randomly generated SM—miRNA interactions.
Randomization and subsequent validating procedures were executed
100 times. As shown in Figure 3A left, the average AUC of the
randomized networks were significantly reduced (p—value : 1.7E—
18) when comparing the original known SM—miRNA interactions
based on multi—layer network and indicates the lower recovery cap—
ability of randomly generated networks. To compare the recovery
capability in SM—II, a total of 664 miRNAs were assigned randomly
as the targets of 39 SMs that have at least one target. As shown in
Figure 3A right, networks based on randomized SM—miRNA inter—
actions show significantly reduced average AUC values. We calcu—
lated empiric p—values for the AUC values individually and applied
Benjamini—Hochberg(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) correction to
adjust for multiple testing. The results showed that the AUCs of 27
SM—Is (out of 31, 87%) and 30 SM—IIs (out of 39, 77%) were signifi—
cantly higher (with FDR < 0.05) than the random AUCs
(Supplementary Table S7).

Additionally, as shown in Figure 3B, we generated curves reﬂect—
ing the overall ROC to predict all of the SM—miRNA interactions of
SM—I and SM—II. The results demonstrate that AUC values reflecting
random interactions were reduced compared with the true values of
0.825 and 0.729 for SM—I and SM—II, respectively, and reveal that
results from our method cannot be achieved by chance and that the
prediction results are significant.

3.4 Measuring the effects of the integrated similarity
approach

We tested three methods (‘T;’, ‘D;’ and ‘T+D;’) to compare their
performance on the miRNA similarity network. A semicolon was

for SM-I and SM-II, and the y-axes represent the average AUC values for each
method. (B) The distribution of overall ROC curves between original and ran-
dom for SM-I and SM-II

used to distinguish two single similarity networks. T and D represent
miRNA similarities based on the functional consistency and pheno—
type of indications. ‘T+D’ represents the combination of similar—
ities. Because the SM—IIs have no known miRNA targets, we can
only compare the evaluation results of the three methods for SM—I
implemented LOOCV. ‘T + D;’ successfully yielded AUC values for
23% of SMs and was in the range of 0.8 to 0.9 (Fig. 4A), and AUC
values for more than 65% of the SMs was greater than 0.8 (Fig. 4B).
The overall AUC of method ‘T+D;’ is 0.749 which is comparable
with that of ‘D;’(0.754) and higher than that of ‘T;’(0.72) (Fig. 4C).
We considered that miRNA related diseases were biologically rele—
vant. If a miRNA network is constructed based on D alone it will
miss some miRNAs having true relationships with diseases. Since,
‘D;’ and ‘T + D;’ produced a similar performance, it is convenient to
use ‘T + D;’ to add biological association to the resulting SM—
miRNA network.

We further compared ‘T + D; T + D + C + S’ (‘ALL’), ‘T;C’, ‘T;S’
and ‘T;’ in which T, D, C and S in SM networks represent SM simi—
larities based on functional consistency, indication phenotype,
chemical structure and side effects. ALL, ‘T;C’ and ‘T;S’ integrate
both miRNA and SM similarity networks using more SM similar—
ities. As shown in Figure 4D, E and F, ‘ALL’ yielded AUCs greater
than 0.8 for 72% of the SMs in which AUC values for 42% of SMs
were in the range of 0.9 to 1. ‘T;’ only yielded AUCs greater than
0.8 for 35% of the SMs and 6% of SMs were in the range of 0.9 to
1. Although Wang et al.(Wang et (11., 2013) showed that chemical
structure similarity was least successful in predicting drug indica—
tions compared to functional consistency and side—effect, ‘T;S’ and

‘T;C’ yielded AUCs greater than 0.8 for nearly 61% of the SMs and
achieved an equal overall AUC (0.778) which demonstrated its use—
fulness as a biological information source. ‘ALL’ obtained the high—
est overall AUC. This indicates that adding various SM similarities
to the integrated multi—level network improves prediction perform—
ance and is important for inferring new SM—miRNA relationships.

3.5 Predicting novel SM—miRNA associations
Upon confirming the reliability of our method by cross—validation,
an independent dataset, and statistical test we further predicted
novel miRNA targets associated with the two types of SMs using
integrated miRNA similarities, SM similarities, and known SM—
miRNA interactions. For each of the 831 SMs, if we start from an
miRNA targets should be ranked at the top of the prioritized tar—
get list. As shown in Supplementary Table S8, an accumulative
hypergeometric test found that known miRNA targets for every
tested SM were significantly enriched in the top 50 of the predic—
tions. For, known miRNA targets for 90% (28) of SMs in SM—I and
67% (26) of SMs in SM—II were significantly enriched in the top 50
pooled miRNAs. The P—values are smaller than 0.05. We speculated
that miRNAs ranked in the top 50 are more likely to reveal hidden
SM—miRNA associations (Supplementary Table S9). We confirmed
this using the following example. Letrozole (letrozole tablets, CID:
3902) is an oral non—

steroidal aromatase inhibitor that has been introduced for the
adjuvant treatment of hormone—responsive breast cancer. Letrozole
decreases estrogen levels by inhibiting aromatase and thereby elimi—
nating the effect of estrogen on tumor growth stimulation. CID:
3902 was taken as a seed for predicting the most likely targeted
miRNAs in our method. We used the top 50 predictions as the po—
tential miRNA targets for Letrozole. Of the top 50 predictions there
were 36, 13 and 38 miRNAs in the HMDD, miR2Disease and
PhenomiR databases, respectively. Each were further identified to be
closely related to breast cancer in which 215, 56,and 272 breast can—
cer—related miRNAs in the respective databases were common to the
candidate miRNAs, and a hypergeometric test found that predic—
tions ranking in the top 50 were significantly enriched in breast can—
cer—related miRNAs. We hypothesize that these miRNAs may be
potential targets of letrozole. Supplementary Table S10 shows the
rank numbers and P—values of the top 50 ranked miRNAs.

The 47th ranked candidate miRNA is miR—206 which post—tran—
scriptionally regulates ERalpha (estrogen receptor 1, Era) in breast can—
cer as verified by miRTarBase (Hsu et (11., 2014), TarBase (Vergoulis
et (11., 2011) and miRecord (Xiao et (11., 2009). Adams et al. found that
transfection of MCF—7 cells with miR—206 specifically decreased or
increased the ERalpha mRNA levels (Adams et (11., 2007). In addition,
over expression of miR—206 reduced ERalpha mRNA levels. miR—206
may be involved in ER expression in breast cancer and may have an es—
trogen—dependent growth regulatory role or be involved with malig—
nant transformation. Jelovac et al. studied Ovariectomized mice
bearing tumor xenografts grown from aromatase—transfected ER—
positive human breast cancer cells (MCF—7Ca) that were injected
s.c.with 10 ug/d of letrozole for up to 56 weeks (Jelovac et (11., 2005).
A western blot analysis of the tumors revealed that ERalpha was
increased at 4 weeks but decreased at 28 and 56 weeks. This suggests
that letrozole may target ER indirectly by interacting with miR—206.

miRNAs are a newly discovered SM drug targets that play crucial
roles in multiple human diseases. The identification of SMs that

target dysregulated miRNAs in cancer would be helpful for develop—
ing a novel effective miRNA—associated therapeutic strategy.
miRNA therapeutics are attracting special attention from both aca—
demia and biotechnology companies and the development of
miRNA—targeted strategies is challenging.

In this study, we integrated an array of SM similarity metrics
and miRNA similarity metrics, combining them with known associ—
ations between SMs and miRNAs, and constructed an integrated
network. After applying a similarity—based RWR on this integrated
network, we successfully predicted potential miRNA targets for 831
SMs on a large scale. We utilized LOOCVs, an independent dataset
evaluations and Wilcoxon rank—sum test to estimate the stable of
our method. Next, we analyzed the effect of merging similarity met—
rics on multiple networks and known targets of SMs on the perform—
ance of the method. As a result, it produced better results than single
network similarity metrics or single networks alone. In addition,
known targets of SMs can be used to improve the accuracy of the
predictions as well. Taken together, the good performance of the
method showed that our method can be used to discover novel SM—
miRNA associations. Ultimately, for all the 831 SMs, we speculated
that those miRNAs ranked in the top 50 are more likely to lead to
SM—miRNA associations. This should be verified by further experi—
ments and may provide future guidance for clinical treatments. In
addition, known targets of SMs can be used to improve the accuracy
of the predictions as well. To illustrate whether the known target
factors of SMs inﬂuenced the results, we compared the prediction
methods of SM—Is and SM—IIs using the same 31 SMs.
Supplementary Figure S3 shows that the results of the SM—Is are bet—
ter than those of the SM—IIs. In this case, potential miRNA targets of
the predicted SM can be surmised according to the miRNA informa—
tion of special SMs that are similar to the predicted SM. However, if
the SM has known miRNAs, we can obtain predictions using
miRNA similarity networks directly. The number of known targets
of SMs can improve prediction performance.

In this work, the SM2miR dataset we developed provides reliable
network seeds for predicting SM—miRNA associations. In addition,
the creation of integrated heterogeneous network is valuable for
inferring new SM—miRNA relationships. We integrated a variety of
similarity metrics for SMs and miRNAs separately, which improved
the identification of SMs targeting miRNAs. Importantly, this meth—
odology can predict the potential targets of SMs even without the
SMs having known target information.

The RWR method involves three parameters: the restart prob—
ability y, jumping probability 2, controlling the impact of two kinds
of seed nodes 11, seed miRNAs and seed SMs. We provide some ana—
lysis on the choice of the parameters for the algorithm in
Supplementary File. In addition, the integrated similarity involves
six parameters: 061,062 [31, [32, [33, [34. The alpha parameters represent
the weights of different similarity evaluations in the integrated
miRNA similarities and the beta parameters represent that in the
integrated SMs similarities. The six similarity measures reﬂect the
miRNA similarities and the SM similarities in terms of different
biology. SM’s chemical structure provides information by the ‘struc—
ture determines function’ paradigm and side effect hints the un—
wanted effect at phenotype level. All of the measures are important
in terms of biology. Thus, we select equal weigh for the six weight
parameters (Li et (11., 2004).

Considering the existing methods predicting SM—miRNA inter—
actions are rarely and these methods implemented on different level
datasets (Jamal et (11., 2012; Jiang et (11., 2012; Meng et (11., 2013).
We analyzed the result of method ALL and other methods that im—
plemented on all integrated network combined different miRNA

similarity metrics with different SM similarity metrics. Every type of
similarity combination of miRNA and SM was firstly applied to
construct the integrated network and was then used to predict SM—
miRNA associations up to now. We traverse the different combin—
ation of small molecular similarity and miRNA similarity to con—
struct the integrated network and calculate the overall AUC of
performance for this algorithm. There are 48 combination strategies
for SM—Is and 45 for SM—IIs. We can’t evaluate the performance of
‘T;’ ‘D;’ and ‘T + D;’ for SM—IIs, because the SM—IIs have no known
target miRNAs. We found the AUCs of different combination were
ﬂuctuant with increasing of similarity metrics, which indicate differ—
ential combination method are competitive (Supplementary Table
S11). Although the AUC of method ALL is not the best, the method
based on miRNA network constructed with T and D reduce the
missing of candidate of miRNAs to some extent. In assuming the six
similarity metrics for all miRNAs and SMs, the method ALL still ob—
tained comparative performance on a perfect candidate miRNAs set
of SMs.

In addition, Supplementary Table S11 enlighten us when a SM
or miRNA only has one or few metrics, we can select alternative
combination method with better performance result to infer SM—
miRNA associations. For instance, when a miRNA has information
of T and D, a SM only has information of C and S, it is also to get a
prediction result based on the integrated network consisted of
‘T+D;C+S’. But this method may be not the best with develop—
ment of more biologically relevant information defining miRNA—
miRNA similarity and SM—SM similarity. For all this,
Supplementary Table S11 is also able to provide some guidance for
our prediction method.

However, known SM—miRNA links are quite scarce, which im—
pacts the evaluation of the method. In the future, with increasing re—
ports of SM—miRNA links, we will further improve the performance
of the SM—miRNA associations prediction method.

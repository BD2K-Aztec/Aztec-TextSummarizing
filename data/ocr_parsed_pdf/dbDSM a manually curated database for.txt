Abstract

Motivation: Synonymous mutations (SMs), which changed the sequence of a gene without directly
altering the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, were thought to have no functional con—
sequences for a long time. They are often assumed to be neutral in models of mutation and selec—
tion and were completely ignored in many studies. However, accumulating experimental evidence
has demonstrated that these mutations exert their impact on gene functions via splicing accuracy,
mRNA stability, translation fidelity, protein folding and expression, and some of these mutations
are implicated in human diseases. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no database specially
focusing on disease—related SMs.

Results: We have developed a new database called dbDSM (database of Deleterious Synonymous
Mutation), a continually updated database that collects, curates and manages available human dis—
ease—related SM data obtained from published literature. In the current release, dbDSM collects
1936 SM—disease association entries, including 1289 SMs and 443 human diseases from ClinVar,
GRASP, GWAS Catalog, GWASdb, PolymiRTS database, PubMed database and Web of
Knowledge. Additionally, we provided users a link to download all the data in the dbDSM and a
link to submit novel data into the database. We hope dbDSM will be a useful resource for investi—
gating the roles of SMs in human disease.

1 Introduction
that SMs could have functional consequences (Bali and Bebok,

Point mutations can be classified as either non—synonymous or syn—
onymous based on Whether they change the amino acid sequence
of a protein (Gotea et (11., 2015). Historically, synonymous muta—
tions (SMs) have been consistently overlooked because they do not
alter the protein sequence and are thus considered functionally ir—
relevant. Many studies completely ignore SMs, Whereas others use
them to build background models for the estimation of deleterious
mutations (Cartegni et (11., 2002; Kimura, 1980). But ‘synonym—
ous’ is different from ‘same’, and accumulating evidence suggested

2015; Buske et (11., 2013; Chaney and Clark, 2015; Hunt et (11.,
2014; Sauna and Kimchi—Sarfaty, 2011; Shabalina et (11., 2013;
Supek et (11., 2014). Over 50 diseases have been associated with
SMs in human genes so far (Chamary and Hurst, 2009). Studies
analyzing the consequences of SMs have revealed that they play an
important role in multiple biological processes, such as mRNA
splicing (Supek et (11., 2014), mRNA folding (Cartegni et (11.,
2002), protein translation and folding (Spencer et (11., 2012) and
microRNA—mRNA interaction (Brest et (11., 2011). In summary,

ignoring SMs in human genes would cause incorrect estimation of
mutation rate in genome analysis (background mutation would be
overestimated and functional mutation would be underestimated;
Supek et (11., 2014).

Currently, there are many databases that focus on point muta—
tion, such as deSFP (Liu et (11., 2013) and miRNASNP (Gong
et (11., 2015). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no
database that can provide comprehensive resources for the disease—
related SMs. To fill this gap, we developed a literature—based dis—
ease—related SMs database called dbDSM (database of Deleterious
Synonymous Mutation), which is proposed to assist with investigat—
ing the mechanism of SM—disease association and facilitate transla—
tional research on disease genetics. We hope it will be a useful
resource for the SM research community.

2 Methods

The ﬂowchart of the construction of dbDSM is illustrated in Fig. 1.
We firstly performed an extensive literature query of PubMed data—
base and Web of Knowledge using a list of key words, such as ‘syn—
onymous’, ‘neutral’, ‘mutation’, ‘disease’ and ‘deleterious’ (for details,
please see Supplementary Material) on December 31, 2015. More
than 500 articles were obtained from PubMed and Web of
Knowledge in this way. After we obtained the literature, we read
through and interpreted each paper by collecting the important infor—
mation, including the diseases examined, mutation position, amino
acid residue and publication information. In our extraction process, if
some information was not available, it was labeled as missing.

In addition, we collected known SM—disease association data
from five public databases, including Clinvar (Landrum et (11.,
2014), GRASP 2.0 (Eicher et (11., 2015), PolymiRTS Database 3.0
(Bhattacharya et (11., 2014), NHGRI GWAS Catalog (Welter et (11.,
2014) and GWASdb database (Li et (11., 2011). We retrieved 1573
SM—disease associations from these databases on June 15, 2015 .

Finally, we consolidated 1289 deleterious SM from ClinVar,
GRASP, GWAS Catalog, GWASdb, PolymiRTS database, PubMed
database and Web of Knowledge. For extracted SM—disease associ—
ations, we collected related information regarding the SM from NCBI
dbSNP/Ensembl database. In addition, we provided a consensus clas—
sification of molecular mechanisms by which SMs contribute to dis—
ease phenotype (Supplementary Material) for each deleterious SM in
our database. We stored and managed all the data in MySQL (version
5.1.73), which is a popular and open—source relationship database
management system that has been widely used in biomedical research.

The data in dbDSM can be easily accessed in a variety of ways.
Users can query the database in ‘Search’ page by gene name, dbSNP
ID, disease name or chromosome number, which results in display
of SM—centered information. Users can also explore all entries of the
database through the ‘Browse’ page. All the results are available to
download for further analysis.

Aside from data retrieval from dbDSM, users are encouraged to
submit novel data into the database. Users may first search dbDSM
to check whether their data have already been deposited into the
database. If not, they may upload the related data information,
which will be stored in dbDSM. The novel data will be forwarded to
the dbDSM developer via email and will become available after a
manual check and confirmation.

All the descriptions above are available in the ‘Document’ page.

In conclusion, dbDSM is the first attempt to establish a litera—
ture—based resource of deleterious SMs. It is a resource for better
understanding SM—disease associations and developing useful infor—
mation for investigating the roles of SMs in human disease. This
database could also be used for the annotation of RNA—seq data
(Supek et (11., 2014). The collection and curation of deleterious SMs
will keep on going and more valuable resources will be integrated
into the dbDSM in the future. We believe that dbDSM will be a use—
ful tool for the biomedical research community.

Abstract

Motivation: Identifying the critical state or pre—transition state just before the occurrence of a phase
transition is a challenging task, because the state of the system may show little apparent change
before this critical transition during the gradual parameter variations. Such dynamics of phase tran—
sition is generally composed of three stages, i.e. before—transition state, pre—transition state and
after—transition state, which can be considered as three different Markov processes.

Results: By exploring the rich dynamical information provided by high—throughput data, we pre—
sent a novel computational method, i.e. hidden Markov model (HMM) based approach, to detect
the switching point of the two Markov processes from the before—transition state (a stationary
Markov process) to the pre—transition state (a time—varying Markov process), thereby identifying
the pre—transition state or early—warning signals of the phase transition. To validate the effective—
ness, we apply this method to detect the signals of the imminent phase transitions of complex sys—
tems based on the simulated datasets, and further identify the pre—transition states as well as their
critical modules for three real datasets, i.e. the acute lung injury triggered by phosgene inhalation,
MCF—7 human breast cancer caused by heregulin and HCV—induced dysplasia and hepatocellular
carcinoma. Both functional and pathway enrichment analyses validate the computational results.

There exist abrupt state changes in many biological processes, in
particular, during the progression of complex diseases. For instance,
in chronic diseases such as cancer, the malignant deterioration might
take place merely Within a few months, while the illness might pro—
gress gradually and be protracted for years before the onset of such
transitions (He et (11., 2012; Litt et al. 2001; Liu et (11., 2001;

Scheffer et (11., 2009; Venegas et (11., 2005). In other words, there
exists a sudden catastrophic shift during the process of gradual
health deterioration that results in a drastic transition from a normal
state to a disease state. However, it is a difficult task to detect the
critical state just before the phase transition of the system from the
observed data due to the lack of apparent state change before the

Fig. 1. Outline for identifying the pre-transition state using Markov model. (a)
A complex biological process can be divided into three states, i.e. the before-
transition state, the pre-transition state and the after-transition state. Both the
before-transition and after-transition states are relatively stable or stationary
with high resilience or low fluctuations, insensitive to the parameter changes.
In the two states, external perturbations will not easily drive the system to-
wards an alternative state. The pre-transition state is a time-varying state
with low resilience or strong fluctuations, sensitive to the parameter changes,
but may be reversible to the before-transition state in contrast to irreversible
after-transition state. (b) First, based on the observed sequence of samples
(0,.1 : {01, 02,  01.1)), we train the hidden Markov model (HMM)
9,4 (0,21) : (A,,1,B,,1,n,,1), that is, in view of stable dynamics, the before-
transition state is modelled as the stationary Markov process 9,,1(0,,1), while
on the other hand, the pre-transition state is defined as a time-varying
Markov process, due to the dynamical characteristics that the pre-transition
state has strong fluctuations and is also sensitive to parameter changes, i.e. it
changes with the time. Thus, based on such dynamical difference of the two
states, to detect the pre-transition state during the biological process is
equivalent to identify the switching point of the two Markov processes or the
end point of the stationary Markov process. Second, under the assumption
that time point T: twith observation 0, is the switching point (or end point)
of a stationary Markov process described by the trained HMM 9,,1(0,,1), we
calculate the probabilityP : P(s, : W1,s,,1 : Wo,...,s1 : Wolem), where
5,: Statemr), and W0 represents the before-transition state of the system, and
W1 stands for the state that is not consistent to W0, i.e. the pre-transition
state. W2 is the after-transition state, which may be another stationary
Markov process but is not the main focus in this work. (0) The large value of P
indicates that a candidate point T: t is the switching point of 9,,1(0,,1) with
high probability

transition. As shown in Figure 13, generally disease progression can
be modeled into three states or stages: (i) a normal state (or the be—
fore—transition state) with the high resilience and robustness to per—
turbations; (ii) a pre—disease state (or the pre—transition state) with
the low resilience and sensitive to perturbations, which is the critical
state just before the phase transition (Achiron et (11., 2010; Chen
et (11., 2012); and (iii) a disease state (or the after—transition state),
representing a seriously deteriorated stage possibly with high resili—
ence and robustness (Liu et (11., 2012). It has been shown that even
though there are no significant differences between the before—tran—
sition state and the pre—transition state in terms of static features
(e.g. average values of state variables), there are significant differ—
ences between them in terms of dynamic features (e.g. deviations
and correlations of state variables) as described in (Liu et 111.,

20143). Specifically, a dominant group or dynamical network bio—
markers (DNBs) appears among the observed variables when the
system state approaches the pre—transition state, satisfying the fol—
lowing three conditions, i.e. high correlations between the variables
among this group, low correlations between this group and other
variables and high standard deviations of the variables among this
group (Chen et (11., 2012; Liu et (11., 2012, 2013a, b, 2014b, 2015; Li
et (11., 2013; Tan et (11., 2015; Zeng et (11., 2014). These theoretical
results indicate that the pre—transition state and the before—transition
state are dynamically different, but are statically similar. Thus, the
dynamics of these two states can be considered as two different
Markov processes, which can be explored to detect the critical state
or the pre—transition state from the observed data. Actually, the
whole phase transition dynamics can be represented as three differ—
ent Markov processes, i.e. one stationary Markov process for the be—
fore—transition state due to its relatively stable dynamics insensitive
to parameter changes (stationary feature), one time—varying Markov
process for the pre—transition state due to its strong ﬂuctuated dy—
namics sensitive to the parameter changes (time—varying feature),
and another stationary Markov process for the after—transition state
due to their relatively stable dynamics insensitive to parameter
changes (stationary feature) (Fig. 1b).

In this work, by exploiting the different dynamical features be—
tween the before—transition and pre—transition states, we developed a
novel computational method based on hidden Markov model
(HMM) for identifying the pre—transition state before the critical
point is reached during the biological process of complex diseases.
Specifically, to identify the pre—transition state is then equivalent to
detect the switching point from one stationary Markov process to
one time—varying Markov process (Fig. 1b). Utilizing the time—course
or stage—course data, we presented the computational method and
algorithm on estimating the inconsistence index of the switching or
end point of the stationary Markov process at each candidate sam—
pling point. Our study indicates that such novel index, which meas—
ures the inconsistence between observed samples and a stationary
Markov process described by a trained HMM, is a model—free ap—
proach that can be theoretically applied to diseases or biological sys—
tems with clear transition events.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we applied the
algorithm to a simulated regulatory network, and three real data—
sets, i.e. the microarray dataset of acute lung injury with carbonyl
chloride inhalation exposure (GSE2565), the microarray dataset of
MCF—7 human breast cancer caused by heregulin (HRG)
(GSE13009) and the microarray dataset of HCV—induced dysplasia
and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (GSE6764). The pre—transition
states were successfully identified for both numerical simulated
dataset and real datasets, and the functional and pathway analyses
also validated our theoretical detections on the early—warning signals
of the imminent critical transitions for those diseases.

2 Methods

We first describe the theoretical basis, i.e. the generic properties of a
complex system in the vicinity of the critical point, and then provide
the procedures used to preprocess input datasets and the detailed
algorithm.

2.1 Theoretical basis

Disease progression or its biological process can be generally divided
into the following three states or stages, i.e. (i) the before—transition
state (or normal state), (ii) the pre—transition state (or pre—disease

state) and (iii) the after—transition state (or disease state) (Fig. 1a).
The before—transition state is a stable state with high resilience pre—
senting a relatively ‘healthy’ stage, during which the state may
change gradually and thus is considered as a stationary Markov pro—
cess. The pre—transition state is a state defined as the limit of the be—
fore—transition state just before the critical phase transition. It is
sensitive to the parameter changes, reversible to the before—transi—
tion state, and thus is considered as a time—varying Markov process.
On the other hand, due to low resilience, even a small perturbation
may suffice to trigger a drastic state change to the after—transition
state, which is another stable state with high resilience and thus is
also considered as a stationary Markov process (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Fig. S2). For a complex disease, the after—transition
state represents a seriously ill stage, in which a system is difficult to
return to the before—transition state even with intensive interven—
tions. Hence, it is crucial to detect the pre—transition state so as to
prevent qualitative deterioration by taking timely intervention ac—
tions. Although elucidating the critical phase transition at the net—
work level holds the key to understand the fundamental mechanism
of disease development and progression, it is notably hard to reliably
identify the pre—transition state because there may be little apparent
difference between the before—transition and pre—transition states.
This is also the reason why diagnosis based on traditional bio—
markers may fail to indicate the pre—transition state.

In this work, by exploring the different dynamics of one station—
ary Markov process and one time—varying Markov process, We de—
sign a method with an inconsistence index (I—index) based on hidden
Markov model (HMM) to signal the impending critical phase transi—
tion during a complex biological process. Therefore, detecting the
imminent critical phase transition is considered as identifying the
switching point or period of the two Markov processes, or equiva—
lently, identifying the period with the drastic increase of the I—index
resulting from the abrupt change of the state—transition probability
(Fig. 1) (Liu et (11., 2015). The detail theoretical derivation is given
in Supplementary Information B.

2.2 Different dynamic features before and near critical
phase transition

In this section, we present the theoretical derivation of our computa—
tional method. The dynamics for the progression of a complex dis—
ease can be expressed by the following nonlinear discrete—time
dynamical system.

Z(t) =f(Z(t— 1);P). (1)

where Z(t):(z1(t),. . .,z,,(t)) is an n—dimensional state vector or vari—
able at time instant t with t: 1,2,... and P : (p1, . . ., 175) is a param—
eter vector or driving factors representing slowly changing factors,
e.g. genetic factors (SNP, CNV, etc.), epigenetic factors (methyla—
tion, acetylation, etc.) or environment factors. f : Ran5 X IR" is a
nonlinear function. For such a nonlinear system, the system will
undergo a phase change at Z or a bifurcation from a stable equilib—
rium when the parameter P reaches the threshold PC (Gilmore,
1993). Detailed descriptions are presented in Supplementary
Information A1.

For system (1) near Z, before P reaches PC, the system is sup—
posed to stay at a stable equilibrium Z and therefore all the eigen—
values are within (0, 1) in modulus. The parameter value PC at
which the state shift of the system occurs is called a bifurcation par—
ameter value or a critical value, and the state just before such a bi—
furcation is called pre—transition state. Generally, a real system is
constantly perturbed by noise, and thus has stochastic dynamics.

The following dynamic and statistic features have been proven when
the system approaches the pre—transition state from the before—tran—
sition state, i.e. a dominant group or dynamical network biomarkers
(DNBs) appears among the observed variables when the system state
approaches the pre—transition state, satisfying the following three
conditions (Chen et (11., 2012; Liu et (11., 2012, 2013a, 2014b).

' Correlations between the variables zi(t) among this group
increase;

' Correlations between variables zi(t) of this group and other vari—
ables z,-(t) decrease;

' Standard deviations of the variables zi(t) among this group
increase.

Therefore, the dynamics between the before—transition state and
the pre—transition state are significantly different. The before—transi—
tion state is a stable state with high resilience, insensitive to param—
eter perturbations, and thus can be modeled as a stationary Markov
process. There is no significant change between the distributions of
Z(t) and Z(t - 1) when the system is in a before—transition state, i.e.
the probability distribution almost keeps constant with the time evo—
lution. In contrast, the pre—transition state is sensitive to the param—
eter changes with low resilience, and its dynamics or probability
distribution changes with the time evolution. Thus, the pre—transi—
tion state is modeled as a time—varying Markov process. The distri—
bution of Z(t) is significantly distinct to that of Z(t - 1) when the
system is in a pre—transition state. Based on such dynamic features,
we can identify the switching period from the before—transition state
to the pre—transition state. The derivation of the Markov process
and the corresponding algorithm is presented in the following
Section 2.3.2.

2.3 Identifying the switching period from stationary
Markov process to time—varying Markov process based
on HMM

We regard that the progression of a biological system in the before—
transition stage is a stationary Markov process. To detect the onset
of the pre—transition stage is equivalent to identify the changing
period from this stationary Markov process to another time—varying
Markov process.

2.3.1 Inconsistence index (I—index)
Specifically, we propose an inconsistence index (I—index) to measure
the probability of a candidate time point as the changing or switch—
ing point from the stationary Markov process to the time—varying
Markov process. On the basis of an observed sequence OH : {01,
02, . . ., 0H}, i.e. the preceding t - 1 sets of samples from time points
1, 2,. . ., t - 1, we train and obtain a hidden Markov model (HMM)
0,4 :(A, B,1r), where the subscript t - 1 of 0 represents that the
HMM is derived from the training samples up to time point t - 1, A
is a state transition matrix, B is an emission matrix, and 1: is a prob—
ability vector for the initial state. The training process based on an
unsupervised learning procedure, i.e. Baum—Welch algorithm, is
provided in Supplementary Information A.3.

Then, I—index, or HMM—based probability P, measuring the
inconsistence between the system state 5, at time t and the preceding
system states under the HMM 0,4, is given as follows:

I(t) I Pt(5t I W1I5t—1 I Wolst—z I W07---7$1: Wolot—LO). (2)

where 0,4 is the trained HMM, 0,:{o1, 02, ..., 0H, 0,} is the
observed sequence up to time t, {51, $2, ..., 5H, 5,} is the state se—
quence with subscript i X {1, 2,. . ., t - 1, t} stands for the state of the

system at the 1th time point, W0 and W1 are unobserved (hidden)
states while W0 represents the before—transition state of the system,
and W1 stands for the state that is not consistent to W0, i.e. the pre—
transition state. W2 is the after—transition state, which is not studied
in this work. Obviously, the inconsistence index I satisfies that

1(t) I 1 — Qt(5t I WOISt—l I Wolst—z I W07---7$1: Wolot—LO),
(3)

where Q, actually represents the probability of consistence between
the system state with observation 0, and the preceding system states
under the HMM 0,4. According to the Markov chain, it follows
Qt(5t I WOISt—l I Wolst—z I Wow-.51: Wolot—ilo)
: Qt(5t : WOISt—l I W070t—170)

W
P(s,_1 : Wold—1.0)

The calculation of the probability Q, with 0,4 is based on the for—
ward algorithm, shown in Supplementary Information A.3.

Clearly, if the testing time point t is in the stationary Markov
process which is described by HMM 0,.1, or observation 0, is derived
in the before—transition stage, then the probability I (t) has no signifi—
cant change comparing with I (t - 1) (see Fig. 1, or Supplementary
Fig. S2), that is, I—index remains stationary when the system is in the
before—transition stage. However, if the testing time point t is in the
time—varying Markov process, or the observation 0, is derived in the
pre—transition stage, then I (t) increases drastically, indicating the
high inconsistence between observation 0, and the HMM 0,4 based
on the preceding t - 1 sample sequences O,_1:{o1, 02, ..., o,_1}.
Clearly the inconsistent data appears at the switching period be—
tween the stationary Markov process in the before—transition stage
and the time—varying Markov process in the pre—transition stage.
Therefore, the abrupt increase of the inconsistence index I (t) signals
the impending of the critical transition, or the occurrence of the pre—

transition stage.

2.3.2 Algorithm
There are two steps to detect the switching period in our algorithm,

i.e.

' Step—1: In the training step, obtain the HMM 0,4 : (A, B,1r)
based on the preceding t—1 observed data (time sequence data)
on I {01’ 02’ ---’ on}. Here A :(ai/‘(t‘1II2X2 With

B : (bi;z (t - 1))2X(n+1) with bi], (t - 1) representing the probability
of the lath possible observation under the assumption that the
system state is S,- at time t— 1, i.e.

bit“- 1) : P(#1(t— 1) I kISH 2 W07 / 6 {0,1}, k 6
{0,1,. . .,n}. (5)

where case #1(t - 1):}: reﬂects that there are [2 molecules differ—
entially expressed in one observation.

' Step—2: In the testing step, calculate I—index of the testing sam—
ple 0, at time point t by Eq. (2) based on both the HMM 0,4
and the additional observation 0,. If there is a drastic increase
of I—index, then t is the switching point, at which system is in
the pre—transition stage. Otherwise go to Step—1 for next time
point.

The detailed algorithm including the training of HMM and the
testing of candidate time point for the I—index is also shown in
Supplementary Information A.3.

2.4 Data processing

We applied our method to real datasets, i.e. the microarray data of
acute lung injury of mice induced by carbonyl chloride inhalation
exposure (GSE25 65), the microarray data of MCF—7 human breast
cancer caused by heregulin (HRG) (GSE13009) and the microarray
data of HCV—induced dysplasia and hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) (GSE6764). These microarray datasets were downloaded
from the NCBI GEO database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo).

In these datasets, redundant probe sets without the correspond—
ing gene symbols were discarded. The expression values of different
probe sets mapped to the same gene symbol were averaged. For each
species, we downloaded the biomolecular interaction networks from
various databases, including STRING (http://string—db.org/), TRED
(www.rulai.cshl.edu/cgi—bin/TRED/), KEGG (www.genome.jp/kegg)
and HPRD (www.hprd.org), i.e. the available functional linkage in—
formation for Mus musculus and Homo sapiens was downloaded
from these databases and combined. After removing any redun—
dancy, we obtained 65 625 linkages in 11 451 human proteins/genes
and 37 950 linkages in 6683 mouse proteins/genes. Next, the genes
evaluated in these microarray datasets were mapped individually to
these integrated functional linkage networks. The network informa—
tion is employed in the post—processing step for visualizing results
and functional analysis. For each disease dataset, the expression
profiling information was mapped to the integrated networks indi—
vidually. Specifically, the gene expression profiling dataset of acute
lung injury was obtained from an experiment of a toxic—gas—induced
lung injury such as pulmonary edema, in which genomic approach
was applied to investigate the molecular mechanism of phosgene—
induced lung injury. The dataset for breast cancer was obtained in
an experiment on MCF—7 cell line with HRG stimulation. Besides,
gene expression profiles of 75 tissue samples were analyzed repre—
senting the stepwise carcinogenic process from pre—neoplastic lesions
(cirrhosis and dysplasia) to HCC, including four neoplastic stages
(very early HCC to metastatic tumors).

Finally, the networks with selected top differential—expression
gene sets were visualized using Cytoscape (www.cytoscape.org) and
part of the functional analysis was based on the website tool DAVID
Bioinformatics Resource (Huang et (11., 2008). The detailed data de—
scription and processing procedures are provided in Supplementary
Information C.

3.1 Identifying the pre—transition state for a ten—node
network

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the computational method and
the inconsistence index, we used a theoretical model of a ten—node
gene regulatory network (Fig. 2a) to generate data and show the de—
tection of early—warning signals near a critical point. These types of
gene regulatory networks are often used to study transcription,
translation, diffusion and translocation processes that affect gene
regulatory activities (Chen et (11., 2009). The specific set of stochastic
differential equations representing the gene regulation among ten
genes in the network (Fig. 2a) is given in Supplementary
Information B, from which the simulated dataset is generated. The
numerical simulation shows that a drastic boost of the inconsistence

Fig. 2. The validation of HMM-based method on a simulation dataset. To val-
idate the sensitivity and effectiveness, we calculated the inconsistence index
using the simulated dataset from a ten-node network. (a) Theten-node net-
work, in which the arrow represents positive regulation, whereas the blunt

It can be seen that an abrupt increase of the probability signals the imminent
critical transition at P: 0. The simulations were performed in
MATLAB(R2013a) using the Euler-Maruyama integration method with the Ito
calculus. The system undergoes a bifurcation at P: 0. (c) We illustrate that
the distribution of the frequency of nodes with large changes, i.e. the ratio of
state-transition nodes. It can be seen that when the parameter P is far away
from the critical value P:0 (P: 0.3, P: 0.2), there are few nodes with large-
scale changes. However, while the parameter Papproaches the critical value
P:0 (P: 0.005), the distribution is quite different, i.e. the ratio of 4-changing-
nodes increases considerably

index indicates the upcoming critical transition at parameter P : 0
(Fig. 2b).

The numerical experiment validates that the inconsistence score
is reliable and accurate in identifying the pre—transition state and
thus provides the early—warning signal of a catastrophic change in
the system. Besides, to demonstrate the different dynamics of the
system between the before—transition state and the pre—transition
state, we illustrate the underlying frequency of nodes with large
changes, i.e. the ratio of state—transition nodes (Fig. 2c). The calcula—
tion details are presented in Supplementary Information B. Note
that there is no clear signal to detect the imminent transition from a
single variable (or a few variables) due to the noise (or stochastic
ﬂuctuations) of the original biological system, which demonstrates
the advantage of exploiting high—dimensional information using our
scheme. In other words, if there is no detailed model for a biological
system, generally we do not know which variable can reﬂect the crit—
ical change of the system so as to measure it. As shown in this ex—
ample, given high—throughput data or high—dimensional
information, the inconsistence score provides a way to detect the sig—
nal for diagnosing the pre—transition state even without a detailed
model.

3.2 Predicting critical transitions in real datasets

We applied the HMM—based method in three real experimental
datasets, i.e. the microarray data for acute lung injury induced by
phosgene gas inhalation (GSE2565), MCF—7 human breast cancer
caused by heregulin (HRG) (GSE13009) and HCV—induced dyspla—
sia and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (GSE6764). Here we

present the application on the dataset of lung injury as an example.
The descriptions of the results on the other two datasets are given in
Supplementary Information C.

The dataset GSE2565 was obtained in an experiment on toxic
gas—induced lung injury effects, i.e. pulmonary edema (Sciuto et (11.,
2005). A genomic approach was used to investigate the molecular
mechanism of phosgene—induced lung injury. The experiments deter—
mined the temporal effects of phosgene exposure on lung tissue anti—
oxidant enzyme concentrations and gene expression levels, and
these results were compared with those from air—exposed mice
treated in a similar manner to assess the role of the glutathione
redox cycle in this oxidative lung injury model. To produce two
groups of data, i.e. the control group data and case group data, two
groups of CD—1 male mice were exposed to air or phosgene, respect—
ively. Lung tissues were collected from air— or phosgene—exposed
mice at eight sampling time point, i.e. 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72
h after exposure. The details of the experiment are available in the
original paper (Sciuto et (11., 2005).

According to the HMM—based method, we regard that each time
point is a candidate transition point, i.e. the end point of a Markov
process in before—transition state. At each sampling point, the top
500 differential—expression genes are identified on the basis of P—
value from the Student t—test. The inconsistence index is then calcu—
lated based on these selected genes (Fig. 3a). Clearly, there are eight
probability curves respectively corresponding to eight groups of dif—
ferential—expression genes. Each group of genes is differentially ex—
pressed at one time point. Among the probability curves in Figure 3a,
the red one presents the inconsistence index calculated based on the
top 500 differential genes with the most significant P—values at the
8—h time point. It can be seen that the red curve shows the largest
probability at 8 h and thus indicates the imminent critical transition.
The selection of 500 genes is from computational consideration. The
gene filtering, detailed algorithm and computation progress are
shown in Supplementary Information C1. To further elucidate the
relation between top differential—expression genes and dysfunctional
pathways, we also carried out the clustering analysis based on cor—
relation at the pre—transition stage (4 and 8 h), that is, based on the
top 500 differential genes, we selected the most significant gene
group (with P—value 1.37E—04 and over 3—fold change comparing
with the control group at 8 h, see Figs 3c) for further functional ana—
lysis shown in Supplementary Information C1. To illustrate the sig—
nificance of the results, a comparative figure with control samples
and bootstrap is presented in Supplementary Figure S6. Besides, it
should be noted that the number of the selected genes is not so sensi—
tive to the inconsistence index (see Supplementary Information C1
for the details).

Besides, to study the top differential—expression genes and their
upstream transcriptional factors, we identified the top turnover
module or subnetwork, that is, by mapping the top differential—ex—
pression 200 genes and their upstream transcriptional factors to the
gene regulatory network from STRING, we illustrate a module with
over 55% turnover genes in Figure 4a. Each turnover gene is highly
(or lowly) expressed before the critical transition and has lowly (or
highly) expression after.

Figure 4b presents the dynamical evolution in the whole gene
network based on the case data of acute lung injury. It can be seen
that those top differential—expression genes (the top right corner in
each network) are strongly correlated with wild ﬂuctuation 8 h after
the exposure to phosgene gas, which provides a significant signal
indicating the pre—transition stage just before the deterioration into
differentiation, while other genes show no significant signal.
Clearly, when the deterioration is impending, these selected genes

the top 500 differential-expression genes from each candidate transition time
points. The red curve represents the inconsistence index calculated from the
top 500 differential-expression genes which are selected at 8h, while the
seven blue curves are those from other time points. It can be seen that the
most significant signal appears at 8 h the exposure to phosgene gas, which is
in coincidence with the experimental observation, i.e. the main physiological
effects occurred within the first 8h after exposure. (b) We illustrate the clus-
tering result respectively for genes at 4h (red bubbles) and 1h (green ones).

P-value of each gene group is more significant at 8h than that at 1 h. The top

form a special subnetvvork. It can be seen that, oppositely, neither
the whole gene network nor the selected differential—expression
genes present a signal before or after the transition, which shows the
sensitivity of the HMM—based method at the pre—transition state. In
fact, the inconsistence index reveals the existence of the pre—transi—
tion state, which, however, cannot be shown by any single bio—mol—
ecule. Therefore, the benefits brought by the HMM—based method
in signaling the pre—transition state make the identification and man—
agement of high—risk cases more effective.

Brieﬂy, those studies suggested that the main physiological ef—
fects occurred within the first 8 h after exposure, resulting in com—
mon observations of enhanced bronchioalveolar lavage ﬂuid (BALF)
protein levels, increased pulmonary edema and ultimately decreased
survival rates (Sciuto et 41]., 2005 ). At the concentration delivered,
5 0—60% mortality was routinely observed after 12 h while 60—70%
mortality was observed after 24 h (Sciuto et 41]., 2005 ). Early—warn—
ing signals of lung injury based on our method are shown in Figures
3a and 4b, which showed that the pre—transition state may start
around 8 h, whereas the system may enter the after—transition state
(or disease state) after 12 h. Our prediction based on the inconsis—
tence index agreed with the actual development of the disease.

Figure 5 presents the second application of HMM—based method
for HRG—caused breast cancer. Based on Figure 5a, each probability
curve is calculated based on a group of differential—expressed genes
at the corresponding sampling time point. The red curve in Figure
5a shows the most significant increase of inconsistence index at the
90—min time point, which indicates that the most possible critical
transition point is around 90—min time point. Figure 5b shows the

Fig. 4. Dynamical changes in the network during the progression of phos-
gene-induced acute lung injury. To validate the results from HMMbased
method, we show the dynamical evolution of the network structure. (a) A sub-
network with top 200 differential-expression genes is identified from the 4th
clustering group in Figure 3c. In this network, over 55% genes have reversal
(or turnover) expressions when the system progresses from the before-tran-
sition state to the after-transition state, comparing with only 18% turnover
ratio for all genes. (b) The figures show the dynamical changes of the molecu-
lar network at 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 72 h, respectively. Each network was con-
structed from the overall mapped mouse molecular interaction network
based on the expression data. The color of nodes represents the fluctuation
of expression, and the thickness of links stands for the correlation between
each pair of nodes. The group of the 200 genes of most significant differential
expressions is located in the top right corner in each network. It can be seen
that the selected genes show wild fluctuation in terms of their expressions
during 4—8 h. These critical phenomena do not appear before or after this
period, i.e. the before- or aftertransition state. Thus, the pre-disease stage is
around 4—8 h, where the network structure exhibits the most significant
change, just before the critical transition triggered by phosgene inhalation

data of breast cancer. It can be seen that the network structure also
changes significantly at the 90—min time point. In fact, the original
assay showed that the AP—1 complex in HRG—treated MCF—7 cells
contains c—JUN, c—FOS and FRA—1, although the association of c—
]UN in the complex is transient (Saeki et 41]., 2009). Besides, the
stimulation of MCF—7 breast cancer cells with EGF and HRG re—
sulted in very similar early transcription profiles up to 90 min; how—
ever, subsequent cellular phenotypes differed after 3h (Saeki et 41].,
2009), which suggests that the differentiation is around 3 h (the 9th
sampling time point). Therefore, our application results are in coin—
cidence with the experimental observation and successfully detect
the early—warning signal of the impending critical transition.

The results of the third application for the hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) (GSE6764) are illustrated in Supplementary Information C.

3.3 Functional analysis

Phosgene gas is one of the most important and common chemical in—
dustry gases (Schneider and Diller, 2000). Some pathogenic mechan—
isms of the acute lung injury induced by phosgene have been
identified (Sciuto et 41]., 2005 ). According to the results above, a

Fig. 5. The application of HMM-based method on the dataset of HRG-induced
breast cancer. (a) By applying HMM-based method to the microarray data of
HRG-induced breast cancer, we show the inconsistence indices based on the
top 500 differential-expression genes from each candidate transition time
points. The red curve represents the inconsistence index calculated from the
top 500 differential-expression genes which are selected at the time point
1.5 h, while the blue curves are those from other time points. It can be seen
that the most significant signal appear at 1.5 h, which agrees with the experi-
mental observation, i.e. the main physiological effects occurred within the
first 1.5h after exposure. (b) We illustrate the dynamical changes in the net-
work during the progression of breast cancer. The 200 top expressed genes

major change in the inconsistence index of the top differential genes
occurs from 4 to 8h. Pathway enrichment analysis and GO func—
tional analysis showed that the genes in the top significant group
(the 4th red group in Fig. 3c) were closely related to the mechanism
of disease progression (Sciuto et 41]., 2005; Wang et 41]., 2013).
Dysfunction in glutathione metabolism and the chemokine signaling
pathway related to the inﬂammatory immune response was caused
in vivo, which also reﬂected protection against the oxidant—like ac—
tivity of phosgene. Pathways affected by the oxidant reaction be—
came disordered, especially signal transduction via protein—modified
activation, such as the mitogen—activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signaling pathway and the Wnt signaling pathway. The decrease in
PH induced by the HCl—release reaction affected some pathways
that are sensitive to intracellular conditions and related to communi—
cation or transport channels, e.g. gap junctions. Some signaling
pathways may also be relevant to repair, survival, apoptosis and re—
production, such as the gonadotropin—releasing hormone (GnRH)
signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway and TGF—beta signal—
ing pathway (Sciuto et 41]., 2005; Wang et 41]., 2013). At the gene
ontology (GO) function level, some biological processes were also
highly related to acute lung injury. For example, the expression pro—
files of some genes were related to abnormal changes in primary
metabolic processes. This indicates the denaturation of lipids, pro—
teins and nucleic acids that may have been oxidized by phosgene
(Sciuto et 41]., 2005; Wang et 41]., 2013).

The functional analysis for HRG—induced breast cancer and
HCC liver cancer are shown in the Supplementary Information C.

4 Discussion

Complex diseases significantly damage the health of many people all
over the world. Detecting the early—warning signal of the sudden de—
terioration provides an opportunity to interrupt and prevent the
continuing costly cycle of managing these diseases and their compli—
cations. Although it is crucial to detect the pre—transition state so as
to prevent the qualitative deterioration by taking appropriate inter—
vention actions, it is a challenging task to reliably identify the pre—
transition state because the state of the system may show neither ap—
parent change nor clear phenomenon before this critical transition
during the disease progression. This is also the reason why diagnosis
based on traditional biomarkers may fail to indicate a pre—transition
state.

In this work, we presented a computational method with an
inconsistence index based on HMM to identify the imminent critical
transition, which has been shown to be effective by real datasets. It
is worth noting that this method aims to detect the early—warning
signal generating from the pre—transition state (or pre—disease state),
rather than to find the indication of the after—transition state (or dis—
ease state) in which the qualitative deterioration has taken place. As
shown in Figure 1 and in METHODS, generally there are significant
differences between the before—transition state and the after—transi—
tion state, which is why we can find many molecular biomarkers to
accurately diagnose the disease based on the differential expressions
of those biomarkers. But there may be no significant differences be—
tween the before—transition state and the pre—transition state in terms
of expressions, which requires the different types of biomarkers
based on different signals. DNB theory provides such conditions of
the pre—disease state, and we developed HMM—based method to
quantitatively detect the signals of the pre—disease state based on
those conditions. We applied our method to the identification of the
pre—transition state based on both the simulated dataset and the
microarray data from acute lung injury experiment. Given that the
lung damage is not generally detectable until approximately 8 h
after exposure to phosgene gas, we tested the hypothesis that the dis—
ease progression can be modeled into three states: (i) a before—transi—
tion state with high resilience and robustness to perturbations; (ii) a
pre—transition state, defined as the prelude to catastrophic shift into
the transition state, occurring just before the phase transition point
is reached, therefore, with low resilience and robustness to perturb—
ation due to its dynamical structure; (iii) an after—transition state,
representing the seriously deteriorated stage possibly with high re—
silience and robustness to perturbation. Then, based on the micro—
array data, we indicated the existence of the pre—transition stage
right before the critical transition induced by phosgene inhalation.
Actually, an indicative early—warning signal is presented at 8 h after
the expose to phosgene gas. The validation based on simulated data—
set (Fig. 2) and the microarray data of acute lung injury (Figs 3 and
4) demonstrates the sensitivity and effectiveness of our method.
With the genomics or proteomics survey of the CD—1 model rats, we
constructed bio—molecular networks (Fig. 4) to gauge the dynamical
regulations among genes at different hours after exposure to phos—
gene. Besides, we showed that some metabolic pathways respond to
the phosgene—induced interruptions and become increasingly dis—
ordered. Therefore, the HMM—based method provides a computa—
tional way of prying into the underlying mechanism of cell
differentiation and thus helping to achieve the timely intervention.
Our dynamic network analysis suggests, in regard to lung injury, by
focusing at the pre—transition state of the rat model, we are able to
probe the in situ environment changes preceding the development of
lung tissue abnormalities. This may not only lead to deep insights of

external environment interactions, but also identify the effective
time window for novel therapeutic strategies in phosgene—triggered
lung injury.

There are limitations of this work. First, the validity of the iden—
tified pre—transition state and the accurate result need further sup—
ports from animal experiments or clinical studies. Second, the
method is insensitive when the genes are not differentially expressed.
Although this work is merely a step forward towards detecting the
early—warning signals of a critical transition during disease progres—
sion and the algorithm is expected to be improved in both sensitive
and accurate ways, it opens a new way for identifying the early—
warning signals of a critical transition during the progression of
complex diseases.

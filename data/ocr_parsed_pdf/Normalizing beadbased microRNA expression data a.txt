ABSTRACT

Motivation: Compared with complementary DNA (cDNA) or
messenger RNA (mRNA) microarray data, microRNA (miRNA)
microarray data are harder to normalize due to the facts that the
total number of miRNAs is small, and that the majority of miRNAs
usually have low expression levels. In bead-based microarrays, the
hybridization is completed in several pools. As a result, the number
of miRNAs tested in each pool is even smaller, which poses extra
difficulty to intrasample normalization and ultimately affects the
quality of the final profiles assembled from various pools. In this
article, we consider a measurement error model-based method for
bead-based microarray intrasample normalization.

Results: In this study, results from quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT—PCR) assays are used as ‘gold standards’ for validation.
The performance of the proposed measurement error model-based
method is evaluated via a simulation study and real bead-based
miRNA expression data. Simulation results show that the new
method performs well to assemble complete profiles from subprofiles
from various pools. Compared with two intrasample normalization
methods recommended by the manufacturer, the proposed approach
produces more robust final complete profiles and results in better
agreement with the qRT—PCR results in identifying differentially
expressed miRNAs, and hence improves the reproducibility between
the two microarray platforms. Meaningful results are obtained
by the proposed intrasample normalization method, together with
quantile normalization as a subsequent complemental intersample
normalization method.

1 INTRODUCTION

MiRNAs are short, non-coding RNA molecules that modulate gene
expression by base pairing with the 3’ untranslated region of their
target mRNAs. It has been shown that miRNAs regulate about 30%
of all transcripts in mammalian genomes. Each miRNA can regulate
the expression level of hundreds of different mRNAs (Lewis et al.,
2005). As regulators of gene expression, potential therapeutic targets

and biomarkers, miRNAs were extensively studied in the past few
years. As the number of annotated miRNAs continues to increase,
several large-scale miRNA expression proﬁling microarrays have
been developed, including quantitative PCR and sequencing. As an
alternative arraying strategy to planar substrates that are widely used
in microarrays, bead-based microarrays (beads arrays hereafter)
have been developed either by impregnating beads with different
concentrations of ﬂuorescent dye or by some type of barcoding
technology. The beads are addressable and used to identify speciﬁc
binding events that occur on their surface. Bead-based arrays allow
for the inclusion of many combinations of miRNA capture beads into
a single pool, and provide greater ﬂexibility over time as miRNAs
are discovered and corresponding beads are created. In addition,
beads arrays are expected to have increased speciﬁcity over the
traditional glass-based microarrays (Lu et al., 2005).

Normalization is a crucial process of removing systematic bias
as a result of the experimental artifacts from the data. Many
existing normalization methods assume that the majority genes
are not differentially expressed in the control and treated samples.
Such an assumption might not hold true for miRNA arrays due
to the facts that the total number of miRNAs is small (less than
1000), and the current miRNA microarray platforms possibly do
not include enough miRNAs that are stably expressed (Davison
et al., 2006). As a result, methods such as normalizing by mean or
median might not work well for miRNA microarray data analyses.
In addition, because of the capacity limit of the pools in beads
arrays, the miRNAs are divided into small subsets and the tests
are ﬁnished in various pools separately. The subproﬁles of the
miRNAs from different pools need to be normalized to assemble
a complete proﬁle. Such a normalization procedure is called
intrasample normalization. Because the miRNA sets in different
pools are different, and the numbers of miRNAs in different pools
are small, intrasample normalization is difﬁcult. Furthermore, most
of the existing normalization methods are not applicable. In this
study, we investigate a measurement error model-based approach to
improve beads array intrasample normalization.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 MiRNAs proﬁling analysis and beads array data

Ten human osterosarcoma xenografts specimens are collected. For each
specimen. four samples are prepared as follows: one sample is treated with
saline and used as control (Ctrl); three samples are treated with each of the

three chemotherapeutic treatments: cisplatin (Cis). doxorubicin (Dox) and
ifosfarnide (Ifo). Thus. a total of 40 samples are employed for this study. The
total RNAs are isolated following the established protocols (Bruheim at al..
2009; Xi at al.. 2007). Luminex FlexmiR MicroRNA Human Panel (Luminex
Corp.. TX. USA) is employed for miRNA proﬁling analysis. All procedures
are conducted by strictly following the manufacturer’s instructions. In
brief. Sug of total RNA per sample is 3,-biotinylated and hybridized to
oligonucleotide-capture probes coupled to the carboxylated S-u polystyrene
xMAP beads. The intensities are captured with a Luminex-200 instrument.
For each sample. a total of 319 human miRNAs are tested by beads array
in ﬁve human pools. The numbers of miRNAs in the ﬁve pools are 60. 64.
64. 65 and 66. respectively. In each human pool. four microspheres (regions
72. 73. 74 and 76) are included for the purpose of data normalization. Each
normalization microsphere (normalizer hereafter) contains a unique capture
probe designed to target speciﬁcally a ubiquitously expressed human small
nucleolar RNA (snoRNA).

2.2 MiRNAs expression validation

The experimental results from beads array are validated using Taqman-based
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) miRNA assays.
QRT-PCR is a prevalent molecular analysis technique for ampliﬁcation
and simultaneous quantiﬁcation of a target molecule. In recent years. the
development of novel chemistries and instrumentation platforms enabling
detection of PCR products on a real-time basis have led to widespread
adoption of qRT-PCR as a preferred validation method (Schmittgen at al..
2008). TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA) Human MicroRNA Panel V2.0
(Applied Biosystems. CA. USA). containing pre-loaded PCR primer/probe
set for 664 miRNAs and controls. is applied for miRNA expression validation
by following the manufacturer’s operating manual and instructions. After
reverse transcription. the mixture is loaded onto TLDA cards and incubated
on Applied Biosystems 7900 HT Real-Time PCR system. The data are
collected and processed using the software endorsed by Applied Biosystems.
Relative Quantiﬁcation (RQ) values are calculated using the standard formula
(Livak and Schmittgen. 2001). An RQ value shows the fold-change (PC) of
a speciﬁc miRNA in two cell populations. RQ=1 indicates that a speciﬁc
miRNA is non-differentially expressed in the control and the treated samples.
Otherwise. if the RQ value is signiﬁcantly different from one. the miRNA is
differentially expressed in the two samples. Among all 319 miRNAs being
proﬁled by beads array. 231 of them are also proﬁled by TLDA. Throughout
this study. the qRT-PCR results are used as ‘gold standards” to assess the
performances of normalization methods.

2.3 A measurement error model for miRNA data

Just as with other cDNA or oligonucleotide arrays. measurement errors exist
in miRNA arrays. The measurement errors are usually produced from various
sources including sample preparation. dying. image intensity and microarray
hybridization. scanning and equipment errors among many others. In this
study. we consider the following measurement error model for miRNA beads
arrays.

x = 1311.2" + e, (1)
where x is the net median ﬂuorescent intensity (nMFI). which is the
background-subtracted response at concentration 11.. In beads arrays. the
background noise is estimated by a spare unit for each molecular unit.
In model (1). 17 represents the multiplicative error that always exists but
is noticeable at concentrations signiﬁcantly above zero; 6 represents the
additive error that always exists but is noticeable mainly for near-zero
concentrations. For gene expression arrays. the actual expression level in
molecular units is hard to be discerned due to the lack of calibration data. In
model (1). ﬂ is a relative expression level that can be adjusted to calibrate
data from different pools or samples to close expression levels for direct
comparisons.

It is unpleasant to work with the gene expression data at the original
scales due to the fact that the distributions of gene expression data are

distributions of the subproﬁles for the same pool for different samples are
higher than those across pools. which is reasonable because the miRNAs
tested in the same pools for different samples are the same.

Applying a Taylor expansion to the logarithm of x for the miRNAs that
are highly expressed. we get the following measurement error model for
log-scale expressions.

The last term to the right-hand-side of (2) is negligible for large “’5 (Ideker

at al. 2000; Rocke and Durbin. 2001; Rocke and Lorenzato. 1995). For
convenience. we assume the following model throughout this study.

10gx= 10g(ﬁ)+10g(u)+n*- (3)

where the last term in (2) is absorbed in 71*. which is assumed to be a

heteroscedastic normal error term with mean zero and variance 0%.

normalization method

To serve the purpose of data normalization. the four normalizers are supposed

to be strongly expressed across pools and samples. and have no biological

interactions with the assayed samples. Let xiJ-k be the nMFI of normalizer i

in pool k for sample j . and 11.,» be the corresponding true concentrations. We

have

logxijk =10g5jk +IOgMi +7713 (4)
for i=1,...,4;j=1,...,4; and k=1,...,5. Our objective is to estimate ﬁjk’s
to commit the intrasample normalization. Now we have

across samples and across pools, we have
E(Tjk - Tjrkr)=10g5jk -10g5j/k/

for any two pools with i 75 i’ or j #j’ , or both. Without loss of generality, we
take pool k for sample j as a reference pool and set ﬁjk = 1. Then we can
estimate the correction factor for pool k’ for sample j’ by

To normalize a subproﬁle, we simply divide all nMFIs in the subproﬁle in

The reﬁnement process can be iterated until the overall likelihood, E =

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Performance comparisons of intrasample
normalization methods

The following two normalization methods are recommended by the
manufacturer:

3.1.1 nmean In (5), the correction factor is computed by taking
the geometric mean of the ratios of the nMFIs of the four normalizers
in two different pools. The FlexmiRTM MicroRNA Human Panel
Instruction Manual Version A-2 suggests to compute the correction
factor by taking the arithmetic mean instead (BG-FMIR-H20-8.0A-
2, 2007),

in (5) and nmean in (6), a median of the ratios of the nMFIs of the
four normalizers is suggested in the FlexmiRTM MicroRNA Human
Panel Instruction Manual (Version B) (BG-FMIR-H20-8.0B, 2008),

All the above three intrasample normalization methods work
under the assumptions that (i) the normalization beads have
intensities signiﬁcantly different from the background noises;
(ii) the normalizers have stable measurements: they have no
biological interaction with the assayed samples. To select the
qualiﬁed normalizers, we screen the normalization microspheres

with nMF13k8e, where (76 is estimated by using the probes that
have intensities close to the mean background. Because the intensity
measures for the normalization beads are usually large, the selection
of k is not that crucial. The results based on the 40 samples show
that k = 3 is sufﬁcient. We also screen the normalization beads based
on their stability by performing a XZ-test: we ﬁrst compute 0% by
pooling the estimated variances for the various normalization beads
under an assumption of homoscedastic multiplicative errors. Second,
we perform a XZ-test with a null hypothesis H0 201-2 :03] to check

whether the variance of normalizer-i equals to 0%. As an alternative,

one can also perform pairwise F -tests to check the stability of the
normalizers. By controlling the signiﬁcance level, we can control
the quality of the beads used for normalization. In this study, we
choose 01:005. Based on the experiment results, the results are
petty stable by varying the signiﬁcance levels from 0.01 to 0.1.

Figure 2 shows the proﬁles of the four normalizers for one
specimen. We see that the proﬁles show similar pattern across
samples and pools. Normalizers 2 and 3 have relatively higher
expression levels, while the expression level of normalizer 1
is smaller than the others. By applying the three intrasample
normalization methods, we estimate the correction factors for the
different pools (Table 1). In Table 1, pool 1 for the control sample
is used as the reference pool. We ﬁnd that the estimated correction
factors by the three methods for the same pool are very close for the
same samples. The overall expression levels of the subproﬁles for
different pools and different samples are also close, except pool 3
for the control and pool 1 for the Ifo-treated sample.

To compare the performance of nme, nmed and mean, a simulation
study is performed as follows: ﬁrst, based on the data after
intranormalization (with any of the three methods, we choose nmed
here), estimate It, 17 and e of the four normalizers. Second, randomly
choose ﬂjk~Uniform[0.6, 1.3] forj=1,...,4 and k=l,...,5, and
generate data X as in model (1). Third, based on X, estimate 13

Last, repeat the above three steps for M times and compare the
performances of the intrasample normalization methods based on
the D’s.

Figure 3 shows the boxplot of the D’s for nmean (left), nmed
(middle) and nme (right), respectively. In this simulation, the
following parameters are used,

{111.112.113.114} = {4915.7423.3731.4864}.
{e,,,e,,,,e,,3,e,,,} = {0.134,0.084,0.157,0.139},
86:68.78, M=10000.

Simulation results show that nme has the smallest median value
(6.05e-3) and mean value (8.86e-3) ofD with SD 9.16e-3. Method
nmed has the largest median D value (=6.84e-3) and mean value
(9.75e-3) with SD (9.94e-3), which is larger than those for nme
and nmean. The performance of nmean is close to that of nme
with a larger median (6.20e-3), but a smaller mean (8.84e-3), and
with the smallest SD (8.70e-3). Based on each generated sample,
D values are computed with the three methods, respectively. Thus,
the three sets of D values are paired. To further compare the D’s,
we perform a paired Wilcoxon rank test for any two sets of D’s.
Results show that the mean of D by nme is smaller than that by
nmed with P < 0.00001, and is smaller than that by nmean as well,
with P: 0.00003. Meanwhile, nmean attains smaller mean of D than
nmed (P < 0.00001).

In the analysis of this study, the iterative procedure for nme
converges within three steps for all samples for stopping criteria
Al/l <1.0e-6 and Al <1.0e-6. In addition, there are only 80
intensity measures (four normalizers in each of the ﬁve pools for
the four samples) involved in computing the correction factors;
the computation burden is pretty light. The simulation with 10000
repeats takes <2 min on a Mac Book Pro with Intel Core 2 Duo at

3.2 Performance comparisons of intersample
normalization methods

All three intrasample normalization methods can also be applied to
normalize the subproﬁles (or the assembled proﬁles) for different
samples. However, the above three intrasample normalization
methods are linear rescaling methods. Their uses could be very
limited mainly due to the fact that the relationship between two
proﬁles are usually non-linear, especially for miRNAs with very
high or very low expression levels. Instead of using the information
of the four normalizers alone, some global information can also be
utilized to normalize the assembled complete proﬁles by considering
the following non-linear normalization methods.

3.2.] Loess Let Y and X be the nMFIs in the treated sample and in
the control sample, respectively. The cyclic loess method is a method
based on the idea of the M versus A plot, where M =log(Y/X) is
the difference in log expression values, and A=log(Y *X)/2 is the
average of the log expression values. A normalization curve is ﬁtted
to the M versus A plot using local regression. Let M be the ﬁtted
values. Thus, we set D=exp((M —M)) and justify the fold change
by multiplying D (Dudoit et al., 2002; Mascellani et al., 2008). The
cyclic loess normalization has been implemented in an R packages
codelink and aﬁy as well.

3.2.2 LoessM This is a modiﬁcation of the traditional loess
normalization (Risso et al., 2009). In loessM, the median of M on
the microarray experiment is subtracted from the loess ﬁt to the
MA-plot D. In miRNA data analysis, such a modiﬁcation could
be important due to the possible violation of the following two
assumptions (i) the majority of miRNAs are equally expressed and
that (ii) the distribution of the log-intensity ratio of deregulated
miRNAs is roughly symmetric about zero (Yang et al., 2002).

3.2.3 Qnorm The quantile normalization method is proposed
ﬁrstly in (Bolstad et al., 2003), which is based upon the concept
of quantile—quantile plot extended to n-dimensions. This method
forces the distribution of all the replicate arrays to follow a common

distribution by replacing the intensities with a certain quantile level
with the average of all intensity measures with the same quantile
level (Garzon et al., 2008; Northcott et al., 2009). The quantile
normalization method has been implemented in R package aﬁ‘y.

In this study, there are no replicated samples tested, as a
result some existing statistical test-based methods to identify the
differentially expressed miRNAs (genes) are not applicable. We use
the fold changes to identify whether the miRNAs are differentially
expressed in the drug-treated sample compared with the untreated
sample (control). The FC value of miRNA-i is computed by F C,- =
xil /x,-0, where xil and xio are the normalized nMFIs of miRNA-i in
the drug-treated sample and control, respectively. If an miRNA has
an FC value larger than the predetermined cutoﬁ’, we classify it as
‘upregulated’; if its FC value is smaller than I/cutoﬁ, it is classiﬁed
as downregulated; otherwise, it is classiﬁed as non-differentially
expressed. The same rule is applied to the qRT—PCR results by using
the RQ values instead of the FC values.

Let (Z112) be a pair of classiﬁcation results based on the bead-
based array and qRT—PCR results, respectively. Each of Z1 and z;
may have three possible results: 0 if non-differentially expressed,
—1 if downregulated and 1 if upregulated. Table 2 shows a three-
way classiﬁcation table to identify differentially expressed miRNAs.
In Table 2, DR is referred as ‘downregulated’, NDE as ‘non-
differentially expressed’, UR as ‘upregulated’, nl-j is the number
of miRNAs classiﬁed as zl based on the beads array results and
z; based on the qRT—PCR results. For illustration purposes, Table 3
shows the identiﬁcation results based on the experimental results for
the control and Ifo-treated sample for specimen #8, by using nme,
nmean and nmed for both intra- and intersample norrnalizations. The
same cutoff 2.0 is used for both qRT—PCR results and computed
FCs, and only the miRNAs that are not weakly expressed are
used. In this study, we ﬁlter the weakly expressed miRNAs by
choosing those with nMFI > 286. We ﬁnd that all three methods are
too conservative: nmean claims all miRNAs are non-differentially
expressed, while nme and nmed claim one as upregulated and the all

 

others as non-differentially expressed. None of them can identify any
of the 50 upregulated miRNAs and the 7 downregulated miRNAs.

Sensitivity and speciﬁcity are two statistical measures of the
performance of a binary classiﬁcation test, which can be computed
as follows,

TN

TP
Sensitivity: — Speciﬁcity: m,

TP+FNi
where TP = n11 + n33 is the number of true positives, FN = n12 + n32
is the number of false negatives, TN=n22 is the number of true
negatives and FP=n13 +n21 +n23 +n31 is the number of false
positives. The sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives
which are correctly identiﬁed as such, and the speciﬁcity measures
the proportion of negatives which are correctly identiﬁed. In Table 3,
all three methods have speciﬁcity zero. The sensitivity for both
nmean and nme is 0.980, and 1.0 for nmed. A more aggressive
strategy can be taken by lowering the cutoff, so that more miRNAs
will be classiﬁed as up- or downregulated based on the FC values.
Table 4 shows the results by choosing different cutoff values. We see
that when the cutoff is 1.8, both the sensitivity and the speciﬁcity do
not change much. When the cutoff is 1.5, the speciﬁcity is reduced
by about 0.2, while the sensitivity is increased no more than 0.025.
The sensitivities can be improved at a cost of dramatic drop of
speciﬁcities. When the cutoff is reduced to 1.3, the speciﬁcity is
decreased more than half, while the sensitivity is barely increased
to about 0.1 (only 0.075 for nmed). In practice, a cutoff shall not be
chosen to be too close to 1.00. Otherwise, the classiﬁcation strategy
will be too aggressive and the speciﬁcity will be sacriﬁced.

As illustrated in Table 4, speciﬁcity and sensitivity are not
good measures to assess the three-way classiﬁcation. For binary
classiﬁcations, a completely random classiﬁcation strategy will
result in an expected value 1/2 for both sensitivity and speciﬁcity, and
a naive strategy by claiming all negative will result in sensitivity:
0.0 and speciﬁcity = 1.0. In three-way classiﬁcations as in this study,
an miRNA could be classiﬁed as upregulated, downregulated or
non-differentially expressed. When a strategy other than the naive
classiﬁcation is taken, the gain in sensitivity may not be able to
compensate the loss in speciﬁcity, and vice versa. A completely
random strategy will result in an expected value 1 / 3 for both
sensitivity and speciﬁcity, which make the performance comparisons

difﬁcult. To address this issue, we adopt the following weighed
kappa coefﬁcient, which is a measure of agreement between two
qualitative classiﬁcation schemes:

kw = (Po(w) —Pe(W))/ (1 —Pe(w)). (8)

where Po(w) = X,- E Wijpij. Pe (w) = X,- E Wijpipj.
pij=nij/Zi2jnije Pi. =nij/Zjnij and p.j=nij/Zinij' The
weights wij are constructed so that Ofwij < 1 for all iyéj, wii :1
for all i, and Wij=Wji. We deﬁne a distance Cij= IZ1 —12| to
quantify the relative difference between categories, and use the
Fleiss—Cohen weighting scheme to compute wij = 1 — C5. /4 (Cohen,
1960; Fleiss, 1969; Fless, 1981; Fleiss and Cohen, 1973; Wang
et al., 2010a).

In Table 4, we compute the weighted kappa coefﬁcients (column
5), and the P-values of testing a null hypothesis that the weight
kappa equals zero (column 6). The results by all three methods
indicate no agreement between the beads array and qRT—PCR results
at signiﬁcance level 01:0.05. From Table 3, we see that more
than 50% of the miRNA are differentially expressed by the qRT-
PCR results, which also indicates that the cutoff for RQ is already
reasonably large. By ﬁxing the RQ cutoff, varying the FC cutoff
does not improve the results. A non-linear normalization is needed
for intersample normalization. Now we apply the three non-linear
normalization methods to the proﬁles assembled by either of the
three intrasample normalization methods. The results are shown in
Table 5. We ﬁnd that the combination of nme and Qnorm leads to
a weighted kappa coefﬁcient 0.195 with P-value of 0.016, which
reveals slight-to-fair agreement according to the interpretation by
(Landis and Koch, 1977). The combination of nmed and Qnorm
also produces a reasonably large weighted kappa coefﬁcient of0. 144
with P=0.075, which is not signiﬁcant at level 0.05.

It is also worth noting that when Qnorm is used for intersample
normalization, the proﬁles assembled by nme for this specimen is
very robust to the cutoff selection. In Figure 4, the kappa coefﬁcients
are computed for different combinations of the FC cutoffs (shown
in the x-axis in each small panel) and RQ cutoffs (for panels in
different columns). For all panels, Qnorm is used for intersample
normalization based on the complete proﬁles assembled by nmed
(row 1), nmean (row 2) and nme (row 3). The y-values of the circles
represent the values of the kappa coefﬁcients. A plus sign (‘+’)
at the bottom indicates that the corresponding kappa coefﬁcient is
signiﬁcant at level 01:0.05, and not signiﬁcant if the plus sign is on
the top. We see that based on the proﬁles assembled by nmed, the
coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant only when in the ﬁfth panel (RQ cutoff is
2.0) and FC cutoff is 1.8, and in the sixth panel (RQ cutoff is 2.2) and

Fig. 4. Weighted Kappa coefﬁcient comparisons for different intrasample
normalization methods, under various FC and RQ cutoffs, and with Qnorm
as intersample normalization method.

FC cutoffs are 1.8, 2.0 and 2.2, respectively. All coefﬁcients based
on the proﬁles assembled by nmean are not signiﬁcant at level 0.05.
Meanwhile, most of the weighted kappa coefﬁcients are signiﬁcantly
different from zero based on the proﬁles assembled by nme.

Overall, the performances of the three intrasample normalization
methods are similar. A study showed that although the intraplatform
reproducibilities for beads array and TLDA arrays are high, the
interplatforrn reproducibility between them is poor (Wang et al.,
201 1). In terms of the Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient between the
beads array FCs and qRT—PCR RQs, the median coefﬁcient is 0.1060
with a SD of 0.0391 based on all 40 samples. As a consequence, the
three methods agree with each other most of the time, revealing
weak agreement between the results from the two platforms.

4 CONCLUSIONS

For beads arrays, there are not many options for intrasample
normalization due to the facts that the number of miRNAs in each
pool is small, and the miRNA sets in different pools are different.
The selection of reliable controls as normalizers is crucial. The
ideal controls should be consistently stable and highly abundant
despite tissue types or treatments. In one of our ongoing projects,
we found that some ncRNAs were inﬂuenced by chemo drug
treatments, such as 5-ﬂuorouracil, cisplatin or doxorubicin. Thus,
it is recommended that the stability of normalization beads should

be checked. We need to be aware of the stability of normalization
controls across a relatively wide variety of tissues, cell lines and
conditions.

Although the common distribution assumption by Qnorm is of
concern in miRNA data normalization, the literature showed that the
quantile method is one of the best normalization methods compared
with some existing one-color miRNA microarray normalization
techniques (Pradervand et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010a). In this
study, results also show that the quantile method works well even
when the number of usable miRNAs reduces to about 100.

The selection of either the fold change cutoff or RQ cutoff
is always a problem in practice. Even if the expression levels
can be measured without any measurement errors, it is a
concern about how to select an appropriate cutoff to classify the
differentially expressed miRNAs. Another concern in miRNA data
analysis is that the expression levels of the majority of miRNAs
are much lower compared with mRNA or cDNA microarray
expression data. Consequently, the measurement error can greatly
affect the FC values. When the basal level is not high, the
measurement error could even dominate an FC value. In this
study, we proposed a measurement error model-based approach for
intrasample normalization by taking the measurement errors in the
measures of the normalizers into consideration. Advanced errors-
in-variables smoothing or regression techniques can also be applied
to improve the subsequent intersample normalization (Wang and
Wang, 2011; Wang et al., 2010b). We will ﬁirther investigate how
to calibrate the measurement errors based on the model in (1) for
intersample normalization, and develop a statistical test for identify
the differentially expressed miRNAs.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Whole-genome and -exome sequencing on parent—off-
spring trios is a powerful approach to identifying disease-associated
genes by detecting de novo mutations in patients. Accurate detection
of de novo mutations from sequencing data is a critical step in trio-
based genetic studies. Existing bioinformatic approaches usually yield
high error rates due to sequencing artifacts and alignment issues,
which may either miss true de novo mutations or call too many false
ones, making downstream validation and analysis difficult. In particu-
lar, current approaches have much worse specificity than sensitivity,
and developing effective filters to discriminate genuine from spurious
de novo mutations remains an unsolved challenge.

Results: In this article, we curated 59 sequence features in whole
genome and exome alignment context which are considered to be
relevant to discriminating true de novo mutations from artifacts, and
then employed a machine-learning approach to classify candidates as
true or false de novo mutations. Speciﬁcally, we built a classifier,
named De Novo Mutation Filter (DNMFiIter), using gradient boosting
as the classification algorithm. We built the training set using experi-
mentally validated true and false de novo mutations as well as col-
lected false de novo mutations from an in-house large-scale exome-
sequencing project. We evaluated DNMFiIter’s theoretical perform-
ance and investigated relative importance of different sequence fea-
tures on the classification accuracy. Finally, we applied DNMFiIter on
our in-house whole exome trios and one CEU trio from the 1000
Genomes Project and found that DNMFiIter could be coupled with
commonly used de novo mutation detection approaches as an effect-
ive filtering approach to significantly reduce false discovery rate with-
out sacrificing sensitivity.

1 INTRODUCTION

De novo mutations (DNMs) represent the most extreme form of
rare variants and play an important role in human diseases

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

(V eltman and Brunner, 2012). With rapid development of
high-throughput—sequencing technology, large-scale whole-
genome or -exome sequencing of parentioffspring trios or multi-
plex families is becoming a powerful approach to investigating
DNMs associated with human disease. Recent sequencing stu-
dies have revealed that DNMs can affect genes with diverse bio-
logical consequences in several neuropsychiatric diseases, such as
autism spectrum disorder (Michaelson et al., 2012; Neale et al.,
2012; O’Roak et al., 2012; Sanders et al., 2012), intellectual dis-
ability (de Ligt et al., 2012; Rauch et al., 2012), schizophrenia
(Girard et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2012, 2011) and epileptic encepha-
lopathies (Epi4K Consortium & Epilepsy Phenome/ Genome
Project, 2013).

Here, we focus on a critical step in such studies, the detection
of DNMs from whole genome/exome sequencing data in parenti
offspring trios. The standard approach used by most studies is to
call variants in each sample of a trio independently and then
identify putative DNMs by comparing offspring against parental
genotypes with Mendelian inconsistency. Therefore, a false posi-
tive variant call in offspring or a false negative variant call in
either parent will result in a false positive DNM call; conversely,
a false negative variant call in offspring or a false positive variant
call in either parent will result in a false negative DNM call.
Although there have been great improvements in development
of single- and multiple-sample variant-calling approaches
(Nielsen et al., 2011), a variety of factors, including sequencing
artifacts and alignment issues, lead to high rates of both false
positive and false negative variant calls. Although allele fre-
quency and linkage disequilibrium (LD) have been successfully
leveraged to improve variant calling accuracy (Le and Durbin,
2011), it cannot apply to DNM calling because no such infor-
mation is available for new mutations.

Distinct from standard approaches, methods that jointly
model parentioffspring relationships within a trio have been de-
veloped speciﬁcally for DNM calling by utilizing Mendelian in-
heritance information within a trio. For example, DeNovoGear
(Ramu et al., 2013) calculates a posterior probability of being a
true DNM call for every candidate-variant site by taking into
account all three samples’ genotype likelihoods under a prior
based on genome-wide DNM rate. Polymutt (Li et al., 2012)
calculates maximum likelihoods of genotype conﬁgurations with-
out and with Mendelian constraint, respectively, and then takes
the ratio of the two resulting likelihoods as the cutoff. The larger
the ratio, the more confident the DNM call is. Due to the use of

Filter de novo mutations

 

extra information in the model, joint modeling approaches
achieve much improved accuracy compared to standard
approaches (Li et al., 2012; Ramu et al., 2013).

Both standard and joint modeling approaches can achieve
high sensitivity. However, in terms of speciﬁcity, despite the
better performance of joint modeling over standard approaches,
both approaches rely on information of single sites assuming all
reads having been correctly mapped, so they cannot eliminate
false positive DNM calls originating from alignment mistakes.
Heuristic filtering strategies and visual alignment inspection via
genome browsers (Robinson et al., 2011) are usually used to filter
out such false positive DNM calls. However, it is inherently dif-
ﬁcult to select appropriate filtering parameter combinations to
accommodate sensitivity and specificity simultaneously; it is also
impractical to manually inspect a large number of candidates.
These challenges necessitate the development of effective and
automated DNM ﬁltering algorithms.

Machine learning is a powerful approach to modeling complex
multidimensional data and has been successfully applied to next-
generation sequencing (NGS) data to identify genetic variants.
For example, Variant Quality Score Recalibration in Genome
Analysis Toolkit (GATK) uses a semi-supervised machine-learn-
ing algorithm, Gaussian mixture model, to estimate the probabil-
ity that each variant is a true polymorphism rather than a
sequencer, alignment or data processing artifact, by evaluating
sequence features extracted from true variants (typically
HapMap 3 sites and polymorphic sites on the Omni 2.5M SNP
chip array) (DePristo et al., 2011). Supervised machine-learning
algorithms, which usually train a model with known true and
false positive variants, are also widely used to classify candidates
as real variants versus artifacts. For example, SNPSVM
(O’Fallon et al., 2013) utilizes support vector machine (SVM)
to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs); the Atlas2 Suite
(Challis et al., 2012) builds a logistic regression model to call
SNVs, insertions and deletions (INDELs); forestSV
(Michaelson and Sebat, 2012) and SVM2 (Chiara et al., 2012)
employs random forest (RF) (Breiman, 2001) and SVM to detect
large structural variants (SVs). In addition, mutationSeq (Ding
et al., 2012) makes use of four algorithms including RF, SVM,
Bayesian additive regression tree (Chipman et al., 2010) and lo-
gistic regression to identify somatic mutations from tumor-
normal paired-sequencing data. Because these machine-learning
approaches can incorporate multidimensional sequence features
into a model, they usually yield better results than approaches
that are based on single or very few sequence features.

Since DNMs are extremely rare, oftentimes real mutations
are buried in a mass of false calls. In this article, we develop
a supervised machine-learning—based approach, namely
DNMFilter, to effectively sift out false DNM calls from a
large number of putative candidates. We choose gradient boost-
ing as the classiﬁcation algorithm for DNMFilter based on
recent reports showing that it can achieve better performance
than other supervised machine-learning algorithms in many con-
ditions (Hastie et al., 2009) and our own preliminary compara-
tive analysis (data not shown). DNMFilter is designed to train a
model based on experimentally validated and collected DNMs
and then classify each novel candidate as a true or false DNM
probabilistically.

In the following sections, we describe DNMFilter, a gradient
boosting approach for classifying and filtering DNM candidates
identiﬁed from any computational or manual approaches. We
investigate multidimensional sequence features in whole genome
and exome alignment context that have been shown to be rele-
vant to DNM calls. Then we illustrate how to employ gradient
boosting to design DNMFilter based on these features. We
evaluate DNMFilter’s theoretical performance and evaluate the
contribution of different sequence features. Finally, we apply
DNMFilter on in-house whole-exome trios and one whole-
genome CEU trio from the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) to
investigate its general performance in practice.

2 METHODS

The basic assumption of our approach is that all true DNMs share
similar sequence features in whole genome and exome alignment
context, and so do non-DNMs. We formalize DNM ﬁltering as a
binary classiﬁcation problem and use gradient boosting as the classiﬁca-
tion algorithm. For classiﬁcation, all true DNMs are deemed positive
examples, while non-DNMs including inherited variants and wild-types
(no variants found in any of three samples in a trio) are deemed negative
examples. Here, we demonstrate how to ﬁlter de novo SNVs, but our
approach can be easily extended to ﬁltering de novo INDELs as well as
de novo SVs.

2.1 Dataset

For the development and assessment of our proposed approach, we use
two real sequencing datasets in this article.

The ﬁrst dataset is Illumina Hiseq whole-genome-sequencing data of
one CEU trio (father NA12891, mother NA12892 and the female off-
spring NA12878) from the 1000GP, which was sequenced to >30X cover-
age and preprocessed at the Broad Institute. The alignment (.bam) ﬁles
were downloaded from ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/voll/ftp/tech-
nical/working/20120117_ceu_trio_b37_decoy/. The DNMs of this trio
were previously called and subjected to experimental validation
(Conrad et al., 2011), including 49 germline DNMs, 952 cell line somatic
DNMs, 129 inherited variants and 1304 false positive DNMs in auto-
somes and X chromosome.

The second dataset is from the published large-scale exome-sequencing
project investigating DNMs in epileptic encephalopathies (Epi4K
Consortium & Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project, 2013). The DNA of
a total of 264 trios was derived from either primary cells or lymphoblas-
toid cell lines (LCLs). All samples were captured using Illumina’s TruSeq
Exome Enrichment Kit. Raw sequencing reads were produced at Center
for Human Genome Variation’s Genomic Analysis Facility (Duke
University). The alignment (.bam) files were generated as the following
steps: all reads were aligned to 1000 Genomes Phase 11 reference genome
using Burrow57Wheeler Alignment (Li and Durbin, 2009); PCR dupli-
cates were removed using Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net); recali-
bration of base quality scores and local realignment around INDELs
were performed using GATK. In this dataset, 329 putative DNMs (309
de novo SNVs and 20 de novo INDELs) were conﬁrmed by Sanger
sequencing.

2.2 Model

Boosting is a powerful technique for combining multiple weak base clas-
siﬁers to produce a form of committee whose performance can be signiﬁ-
cantly better than that of any of the base classiﬁers.

Given a training set of (x1, yl), (x2, y2), . . . , (x,,, y”), boosting aims to
ﬁnd n approximation ﬁx) to a function f*(x) that minimizes the expected
value of some speciﬁed loss function L(y, ﬁx», as follows

ft = arg 113111 Ey,xL(y7f(x))

Boosting iteratively ﬁts an additive expansion of the form
M
ﬂx; P) = X) 13mm; am)
m:1

Where ,8", is the expansion coefﬁcient, h(x; am) is the base classiﬁer para-
meterized by am.

Gradient boosting is one kind of boosting algorithms that applies
steepest descent to minimize the loss function on the training data. At
iteration step m, the gradient is calculated by

aflxi) 1(2):]..- l (x1)

Then fm, f = {f(x1),f(x2), . . . ,ﬂxn)}T is updated as follows
fm meil — pmgm
Where pm is the step length, which is calculated by

pm 2 argn’gn L(fm71 — pgm)-

Gradient boosting machine (Friedman, 2001) makes use of decision
trees as the base classiﬁers and implements the above generic gradient-
boosting algorithm. In addition, stochastic gradient boosting (Friedman,
2002) incorporates the idea of bagging to gradient-boosting machine,
which can improve the performance by ﬁtting every base classiﬁer with
bootstrapped samples of the whole dataset at each iteration step.

In this article, we use gradient-boosting machine as well as stochastic
gradient boosting implemented in the R gbm package (http://cran.r-pro-
ject.org/web/packages/gbm/index.html). As to the parameter settings,
Bernoulli distribution is chosen as the loss function, shrinkage is set to
0.001, tree construction depth is set to 1 and bag fraction is set to 0.5.
Moreover, 10-fold cross-validation is used for tuning the number of iter-
ations. The remaining parameters are all with gbm package’s default
settings. In addition, a score between 0 and 1 will be produced for each
prediction, representing the probability of the classiﬁcation as the true
DNM.

2.3 Feature selection

In this article, we selected 59 sequence features which we believe are able
to discriminate DNMs from non-DNMs. The description is shown in
Table 1. All sequence features are directly extracted from three individ-
uals’ BAM ﬁles in a trio. The selected features can be generally divided
into three categories: pileup features, alignment features and cross sample
features. The pileup features include allele balance, mean base quality and
read depth, which are usually employed by other DNM detection and
heuristic ﬁltering approaches. To characterize the DNMs which may be
mistakenly detected by the effect of alignment mistakes, we incorporate
alignment features into the model, including mean mapping quality,
strand direction, strand bias, mean number of nearby mismatches,
mean number of nearby INDELs, fraction of soft clipped reads and
fraction of MQO (mapping quality is equal to 0) reads. Alignment
errors usually show position-dependence and appear with greater fre-
quency at some positions than others (Meacham et al., 2011). Based on
this character, Fisher exact test can be used to test reference and alterna-
tive allele counts of two samples at the same position, which can avoid the
interference of sequencing errors. If the resulting P-value is signiﬁcant,
then the genotypes of these two samples are different. VarScan 2
(Koboldt et al., 2012) applies the similar idea to ascertain somatic muta-
tions in tumor-normal paired-sequencing data. For true DNMs, the
genotypes of the parents should be different from that of offspring at
the same position, so we borrow this idea to generate two cross sample
features.

2.4 Construction of training set

The most common strategy for building a training set is to directly use
experimentally validated DNMs, including true positive DNMs and false
positive ones. However, this strategy is usually limited by the relatively
small number of validated DNMs.

In this article, we use in-house sequenced whole-exome trios to build
the training set. Speciﬁcally, we use the experimentally conﬁrmed true
DNMs as positives and the candidates failing validation as negatives.
Since we have fewer negative candidates, we expand the negative class
by including further candidates using the following criteria: (i) run com-
monly used DNM-detection approaches on trios to obtain a candidate
list; (ii) exclude all conﬁrmed true positive DNMs from the candidates;
(iii) bootstrap samples from the results of step 2 and regard them as
negative examples. This strategy for choosing false positive DNMs

False positive rate

Fig. 1. (A) The ﬁrst two principal components after PCA projecting for the training set built. (B) The ROC curves of leave-one-out cross validation and

prediction on validated DNMs of a 1000GP CEU trio

works because the commonly used DNM detection approaches can gen-
erate hundreds of candidate DNM calls and majority of the candidates
are false based on the mutation rate. Using this procedure we believe that
such an augmented negative set not only contains preponderant false
positive DNMs but also serves as a more representative sample of false
positives that are likely to be generated by most popular DNM callers.
With this strategy, our trained model has the power to ﬁlter out a wide
range of false positives and can obtain an unbiased prediction of candi-
date DNM calls.

2.5 DNMFilter: DNMs ﬁlter

We develop DNMFilter based on the approach described above.
DNMFilter consists of two core modules: (i) that extracts sequence fea-
tures of known DNMs to build the training set; (ii) that selects sequence
features to train gradient-boosting model and applies the trained model
to ﬁlter out false positive DNMs. DNMFilter is designed to work on any
candidate DNM call set obtained from any computational or manual
approaches. DNMFilter is implemented using a combination of Java
and R.

3 RESULTS

We build the training set using the approach described in Section
2.4 and evaluate the model’s theoretical classiﬁcation perform-
ance. In addition, we evaluate different sequence features’ con-
tribution to the model’s performance. Furthermore, we combine
DNMFilter with commonly used DNM detection approaches
and apply them on in-house whole-exome trios and one
1000GP CEU trio to look into its performance in the general
case.

3.1 Theoretical performance evaluation

According to the approach in Section 2.4, we build a training set
with 185 experimentally confirmed true autosomal DNMs and
587 collected false autosomal DNMs identified in 2/3 (176) in-
house exome trios. We use principal component analysis (PCA)
to project 59 dimensional sequence features to two principal
components (see Fig. 1A). The result shows the selected sequence
features can conﬁdently discriminate true positive from false

positive DNMs, suggesting that the training set constructed as
in Section 2.4 is able to capture a broad range of false positive
patterns and expected to be effective in ﬁltering out false positive
candidates. We also explore higher dimensions and ﬁnd that
more principal components can further facilitate separating the
two classes (data not shown). With the training set built, we train
the model and evaluate its performance using leave-one-out
cross-validation and testing its predictive power on 2434 experi-
mentally conﬁrmed (true and false) DNMs of one 1000GP CEU
trio. Two receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are
shown in Figure 1B, indicating that the model is robust and
can achieve high sensitivity and speciﬁcity theoretically.

3.2 Feature importance

To evaluate the contribution of each selected sequence feature,
we employ the feature relative importance measure approach
available in R gbm package. The relative importance of all 59
features for the above training set in Section 3.1 is shown in
Figure 2. Not surprisingly, three allele balance features and off-
spring’s mean mapping quality for both reference and alternative
alleles are among the top-ranked features. In addition, paired
samples test introduced in this article contribute signiﬁcantly to
the performance. Alignment features except mean mapping qual-
ity also have non-zero relative importance, suggesting alignment
mistake is an important cause of false DNMs.

3.3 Performance on in-house whole-exome trios

To investigate DNMFilter’s performance in general, we apply it
on the remaining 1/3 (88) in-house exome trios. The process is as
follows: we ﬁrst detect DNMs using common DNM-detection
approaches, including Naive Caller, polymutt (version 0.15) and
DeNovoGear (version 0.5.2), and then use DNMFilter to ﬁlter
candidate DNMs obtained by each approach, respectively. Here
the standard approach (also named Naive Caller) refers to using
GATK UnifiedGenotyper to call variants jointly for all individ-
uals within a trio and then comparing genotypes to identify can-
didate DNMs. To make a fair comparison, we design several

heuristic filtering strategies as follows: (i) only keep the call where
heterozygous genotype is present in offspring and homozygous
reference genotypes are present in both parents; (ii) each of three
samples in a trio is covered by at least 10 reads; (iii) minimum
DQ for polymut and minimum pp_dnm for DeNovoGear are
both with default settings to ensure highest sensitivity, and Naive
Caller’s Phred-scaled likelihood (PL) for the genotypes AA, AB
and BB, where A is the reference allele and B is the alternate
allele, are set as >20, 0, >20 for the offspring and 0, >20, >20 for
both parents. There are a total of 109 autosomal DNMs in the 88
trios that were conﬁrmed in the previous study, but 1 DNM is of

low coverage (<10) that does not meet the above heuristic ﬁlter-
ing criteria, so this DNM is excluded in the following analysis.
Table 2 shows that DNMFilter can signiﬁcantly reduce the aver-
age number of DNM calls per trio compared with DNM-detec-
tion approaches with heuristic filtering strategies, and also
maintain a high sensitivity, indicating that the vast majority of
candidates removed by DNMFilter are false positives. Due to the
presence of somatic mutations in cell lines, 11 LCL trios have
more putative DNM calls than the 77 primary trios.

To evaluate DNMFilter’s scoring performance, we check
DNMFilter scores of all 108 conﬁrmed DNM calls as well as

scores of the remaining DNM calls (excluding conﬁrmed DNM
calls from results of Naive Caller, DeNovoGear and polymutt).
We rank all candidates by DNMFilter score. Figure 3A shows
that DNMFilter score can clearly discriminate conﬁrmed DNMs
from the remaining DNM calls. Even at a low cutoff,
DNMFilter can eliminate a large proportion of false positive
DNM calls. To evaluate DNMFilter’s ranking performance,
minimum genotype quality (GQ) for Naive Caller, DQ for poly-
mut and pp_dnm for DeNovoGear, along with DNMFilter score
are used to rank all putative DNM calls, respectively. Figure 3B
shows that most validated true DNMs are ranked at the top by
DNMFilter, demonstrating effectiveness of the algorithm in
removing false positives that are mistakenly regarded as highly
conﬁdent by other callers. This suggests that DNMFilter score as
well as predictions from other callers can be combined to more
reliably cull out true DNMs from a large number of candidate
calls for experimental validation and further analysis.

3.4 Performance on 1000GP CEU trio

We also combine DNMFilter with three commonly used DNM-
detection approaches as did in Section 3.3 and apply them on
one 1000GP whole-genome-sequenced CEU trio that is inde-
pendent of the sequencing data used for building the training

set. Table 3 shows that DNMFilter significantly reduces the
number of false positive DNMs, compared with other common
DNM-detection approaches, while maintaining the high sensitiv-
ity of detecting true germline and somatic DNMs. It’s worth
noting that although the final number of DNMs obtained by
DNMFilter is greater than the number of validated germline
and somatic DNMs, it is assumed that there are a number of
cell line somatic or even germline DNMs missed by Conrad et a].
because of the limitation of early sequencing technology and
data-preprocessing pipeline as well as the originally low sequen-
cing coverage. In addition, despite that the training set is con-
structed with whole-exome-sequencing data, our result suggests
that it can be effectively applied to whole-genome-sequencing
data as well.

4 DISCUSSION

In summary, we developed DNMFilter, a novel gradient
boosting-based approach for filtering DNMs identiﬁed in par-
entioffspring trios. We curated 59 sequence features in whole-
genome and -exome alignment context and employed gradient
boosting as the classiﬁcation algorithm. We built the training set
with confirmed true and false positive DNMs as well as collected

false positive DNMs. The evaluation of theoretical performance
demonstrates that DNMFilter works conﬁdently for its designed
purpose. According to feature relative importance measure, we
showed that alignment error is a signiﬁcant cause of false DNM
calls. We also applied DNMFilter on in-house whole-exome trios
and one 1000GP CEU trio, and found that DNMFilter could
maintain the high sensitivity and signiﬁcantly reduce false posi-
tive DNMs when coupled with commonly used DNM detection
approaches.

All results indicate that DNMFilter is a valuable complement
for existing DNM detection approaches. By combining
DNMFilter with any DNM detection approach(es) into a pipe-
line, users can first relax the confidence of detection step to
ensure sensitivity, and then DNMFilter can be employed to
ﬁlter out false positive DNM calls, which eventually leads to a
reasonable size of highly conﬁdent DNM call set for experimen-
tal validation and further analysis. In particular, DNMFilter is
expected to work best when it is applied to samples from the
same sequencing and alignment pipeline as the ones used in the
training set.

In future, we will consider extending DNMFilter to other
kinds of DNMs, such as INDELs and SVs. Currently,
DNMFilter’s power is largely limited by the small number of
known DNMs, especially for potential de novo INDEL and SV
ﬁltering. As more parentioffspring trios are sequenced in future,
more DNMs within a more complete variant spectrum will be
validated and incorporated into the training set. We plan to ac-
tively update DNMFilter with new whole-exome and -genome
data to make it more effective and robust. We also consider
incorporating additional relevant sequence features to capture
a more comprehensive pattern discriminating true and false
DNM calls that might not be represented by existing sequence
features. We hope that DNMFilter is useful to the community as
either a stand-alone tool for detecting DNMs or a ﬁltering strat-
egy combined with other DNM detection tools to boost both
sensitivity and speciﬁcity.

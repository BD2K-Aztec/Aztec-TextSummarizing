ABSTRACT

Motivation: Given a pair of metabolic pathways, an alignment of the
pathways corresponds to a mapping between similar substructures of
the pair. Successful alignments may provide useful applications in
phylogenetic tree reconstruction, drug design and overall may
enhance our understanding of cellular metabolism.

Results: We consider the problem of providing one-to-many align-
ments of reactions in a pair of metabolic pathways. We first provide
a constrained alignment framework applicable to the problem. We
show that the constrained alignment problem even in a primitive set-
ting is computationally intractable, which justiﬁes efforts for designing
efficient heuristics. We present our Constrained Alignment of
Metabolic Pathways (CAMPways) algorithm designed for this purpose.
Through extensive experiments involving a large pathway database,
we demonstrate that when compared with a state-of-the-art alterna-
tive, the CAMPways algorithm provides better alignment results on
metabolic networks as far as measures based on same-pathway
inclusion and biochemical significance are concerned. The execution
speed of our algorithm constitutes yet another important improvement
over alternative algorithms.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolic pathways consisting of metabolites, biochemical reac-
tions transforming a set of metabolites to others and enzymes
catalyzing these reactions provide valuable information regard-
ing material processing centers of a functioning cell and cellular
metabolism in general. Several online databases including
KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2012) and BioCyc (Caspi et al., 2008)
provide access to metabolic pathways of various organisms. A
comparative analysis of pathways from different organisms
provides insights for understanding evolution, speciation, phylo-
genic reconstruction aVIithani et al., 2011; Heymans and Singh,
2003) and drug target discovery (Guimera et al., 2007).
Pharmaceutical drug testing is usually implemented on animals,
most of the time on mice, before human testing. In such an
application, it is usually crucial to know whether specific path-
way components of the two species exhibit similar properties
(Caglic et al., 2009). A successful pathway alignment would
prove useful for determining whether test results on one species

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

could be transferred to another without incurring complications.
Furthermore, such an analysis is not limited to that between
different organisms. It may also be applied between pathways
of cancer types and those of healthy cell types to enhance our
understanding of cancer-speciﬁc metabolic features (Agren et al.,
2012).

A common method for comparative analysis of pathways and
biological networks in general is through network alignment.
Given a pair of biological networks either from different species
or from different tissues within the same species, the goal of
network alignment is to map components in one of the networks
to their similar counterparts in the other. With regard to align-
ments targeting specifically metabolic pathways, several methods
have been suggested. In Tohsato et a]. (2000), an alignment
method based on enzyme hierarchies and enzyme EC number
similarity was suggested for the alignment of possibly more than
two pathways. Path matching and graph matching to query cer-
tain metabolic pathways in an input graph was provided by
Yang and Sze (2007). Sets of reactions in multiple pathways
were compared, omitting the connectivity between the reactions
in Clemente et a]. (2007). Heymans and Singh (2003) created an
enzyme graph and obtained a one-to-one mapping between the
enzymes of two input pathways via maximum weight bipartite
matching. Similar enzyme graph construction was used in Pinter
et a]. (2005). An integer quadratic programming-based method
was suggested by Zhenping et a]. (2007). Similar to metabolic
pathway alignment is the problem of proteiniprotein interaction
(PPI) network alignment. The graph models used in the latter are
undirected, whereas the former usually aligns directed graphs.
However, as far as general graph matching and alignment is
concerned, most of the time, the techniques can be extended in
both directions, and mainly similar approaches are proposed.
Two versions of network alignment have been suggested in
related work. In local network alignment, the goal is to identify
from the input networks, subnetworks that closely match in
terms of network topology and/or sequence similarities.
Approaches proposed for this version of the problem include
PathBLAST (Kelley et al., 2004), NetworkBLAST (Sharan
et al., 2005), MaWISh (Koyutﬁrk et al., 2006) and Graemlin
(Flannick et al., 2006). In global network alignment on the
other hand, the goal is to align the networks as a whole, provid-
ing unambiguous mappings between the nodes of different net-
works. Starting with IsoRank (Singh et al., 2008), several global
network algorithms using similar deﬁnitions have been suggested
(Aladag and Erten, 2013; Chindelevitch et al., 2010; Kuchaiev
and Przulj, 2011; Zaslavskiy et al., 2009).

We provide a constrained alignment framework and a meta-
bolic pathway alignment algorithm, CAMPways. Our algorithm
is inspired by the model suggested in Ay et a]. (2011). Within this

general model, the goal is to ﬁnd a global one-to-many alignment
of the pathways such that a node may be mapped to a connected
subgraph of many nodes. The model is justiﬁed by the fact that
biologically meaningful mappings may exist when different
organisms perform the same function through varying number
of steps. Therefore, it appropriately handles the gaps/mismatches
inherent in alignment problems, an issue arising in both
sequence-related and network-wise alignment. Such is the motiv-
ation behind the PPI network alignment approach of Liao et al.
(2009) as well. Although this general model of one-to-many
alignments is the same, our method diverges from that of
Ay et al. (2011) after this point. The novelties of the current
work are 3-fold. First of all we provide a novel constrained align-
ment framework appropriate for the one-to-many alignments
model. This framework has not been used in biological network
alignment previously. Second, we show that even the simplest
version of the alignment problem within this framework is com-
putationally hard. Based on this computational intractability
result, we ﬁnally provide a novel algorithm, CAMPways,
which appropriately and efﬁciently implements this framework.
Through experimental evaluations based on reverse engineering
pathways and biochemical signiﬁcance measured through func-
tional group conversion hierarchy of KEGG (Kanehisa et al.,
2012), we demonstrate that the CAMPways algorithm provides
higher quality alignments than the state-of—the-art approaches.
Furthermore, a second major advantage of the CAMPways
algorithm is in terms of its much faster execution speeds as com-
pared with the alternatives.

2 METHODS AND ALGORITHMS

2.1 Problem deﬁnition

The metabolic pathway alignment problem deﬁnition we con-
sider is based on the one-to-many alignments of the reaction-
based pathway representations used in (Ay et al., 2011). Given
a metabolic pathway 73, we assume a reaction-based representa-
tion GP 2 (VP, Ep) 0f 73. G P is a directed graph where each node
an 6 VP corresponds to a reaction r,- in 73. There exists a directed
edge (u,.,., urj) if an output compound of r,- is an input compound
of r]. If r,- is reversible, the edge existence condition is extended by
considering the case where an input compound of r,- becomes an
input compound of rj. Similar extension applies to rj as well.
Thus, if both reactions are reversible, there are in total four
cases for the existence of an edge.

Given two pathway representations GP,G3,, we need to for-
malize the types of mappings that are allowed under the one-to-
many mapping restrictions. Let Rx indicate a subset of VP such
that the induced subgraph of the nodes in R, is connected in the
underlying undirected graph. Denote the set of all such subsets of
size greater than zero and less than or equal to k with Rk. Let R;
denote the analogous set for G}. A legal alignment A between
GP, G} is a set of mappings (RX, R3,) for RX 6 Rk, R; e R;C such
that the following are satisﬁed:

(i) For (RX,R;) e A, IRX| or |R§C| is 1.

(ii) For (RX, R3,) 6 A and (Ry, R/y) e A, RX (1 R = 0 and
R; O R; = 0.

The ﬁrst condition implies that all mappings in the alignment
are one-to-many mappings, whereas the second implies that all
mappings are pairwise compatible in the sense that no reaction
from a given pathway may belong to more than one mapping.
The quality of an alignment is usually deﬁned in terms of two
possibly conﬂicting measures; homological similarity and topo-
logical similarity. The former can be deﬁned as a sum of hom-
ology scores of all mappings in the alignment. The homology
score of a given mapping (RX,R;) can be deﬁned in terms of
the similarities of input compounds, output compounds and
enzymes of R, and R3,. Such similarity scores are usually deter-
mined as a result of sequential similarity analysis of the molecules
under consideration (enzymes or input/output compounds). For
the current study, we use the homological similarity scores pro-
duced by Ay et al. (2011). For a given mapping (RX,R;), ﬁrst
EX, E36, which correspond to the unions of all enzymes involved
in the reactions subsets R, and R3,, respectively, are produced.
An enzymatic homological similarity between EX, E; can be com-
puted by creating a bipartite graph where a partition corresponds
to the enzymes of E, and the other to those of  A similarity
score between every pair of enzymes from E, and E; is assigned
as the weight of the corresponding edge in the bipartite graph.
The homology score between EX,Ey then corresponds to the
maximum weight bipartite matching of the produced graph.
Similar constructions can be carried out for the unions of
input compounds, 1,6,1; and the unions of output compounds
0,003,. The homology score of RX,R; is then deﬁned as a
convex combination of the scores attained from the scores cal-
culated independently for the enzymes, input compounds and
output compounds. Topological similarity on the other hand is
a measure of the conservation of network topologies with respect
to the given set of mappings in the alignment. Given a pair of
mappings (RX,R;) e A and (Ry,R’y) e A, a conserved edge is
induced by this pair if there exists an edge from a reaction in
R, to a reaction in Ry and an edge from a reaction in R; to a
reaction in R}, or vice versa. Topological similarity is then
deﬁned as a score proportional to the number of conserved
edges induced by the pairs of mappings in the alignment. Once
both types of similarity scores are resolved, the network align-
ment problem is usually posed as that of maximizing a convex
combination of these two scores.

2.2 Constrained alignment framework

We provide a formal description of our constrained alignment
framework within the provided one-to-many pathway align-
ments model. Rather than posing the problem as one of a sim-
ultaneous optimization of two possibly conflicting goals, that is,
that of homological similarity and of topological similarity, we
propose a framework where the only goal is to maximize topo-
logical similarity while satisfying some constraints on homologi-
cal similarity.

Given a pathway representation GP 2 (VP, Ep) let G; denote
the kth extension of G1,. It is a directed, edge-weighted graph.
Each node qu in G; corresponds to a reaction subset
RX 6 Rk. There exists a directed edge (qu,uRy) in G; if there
exists a directed edge from u,.,. to aw in GP, where r,- e RX and
rj e Ry. Let w(qu, uRy) denote the total number of such edges.
We note that Gg‘ can be deﬁned analogously. The set of

constraints of node qu in GE, denoted with Cons(qu), is defined
as the subset of nodes of 0" that qu can be mapped to. The
definition can be extended to the nodes of Gg‘ analogously. Note
that this deﬁnition is symmetrical in the sense that
big} e Cons(qu) if and only if qu e Cons(uR;). Assume
|Cons(qu)| 5 k1 for any node qu in G; and |Cons(uR})| 5 kg
for any node Ltng in Gg‘, for fixed constants k1 and k2. All con-
straints can be represented as a bipartite similarity graph where
the nodes of G; form one partition and those of Gg‘ form the
other, and each constraint is represented with an edge in the
bipartite graph. The constrained alignment problem is that of
ﬁnding a subset of constraints, that is, a subset of edges from
the bipartite similarity graph, such that the subset of edges deﬁne
a legal alignment and the number of conserved edges induced by
the alignment is maximum. It is worth noting that the concept of
constrained alignments has appeared in biological network align-
ment literature before. Zaslavskiy et al. (2009) provide a deﬁn-
ition of constrained alignments applicable to global one-to-one
alignments of PPI networks. We note that our constrained align-
ment framework may trivially be generalized to undirected PPI
networks. Moreover, our framework is more general; it strictly
includes the model of Zaslavskiy et al. (2009). There are instances
that can not be deﬁned using their model, whereas the opposite is
never the case. Using our notation, given qu, uRy from one of the
networks, if Cons(qu) ﬂ Cons(uRy) 75 0, their model imposes the
condition that Cons(qu) = Cons(uRy). Considering the case
where the Cons definition reflects high-homological similarity,
this is restrictive; either long homologically similar chains of
nodes are to be created incorrectly or some homologically similar
pairs missed completely.

We ﬁrst state that the constrained alignment problem defined
herein is computationally intractable even in a restricted case.

PROPOSITION 2.1. The constrained alignment problem where
k 2 k1 = 1 and k2 = 3 is NP—complete.

PROOF. Because of space considerations, the proof is provided
in the Supplementary Document. We simply state that as the
proof works for the undirected graphs as well, the same theorem
can immediately be applied to the constrained pairwise align-
ment of PPI networks. I

To provide further depth to our understanding of the problem
within the constrained alignment framework, we next state the
following proposition, which may suggest a clue as to the point
the computational intractability starts dissolving.

PROPOSITION 2.2. The constrained alignment problem where
k 2 k1 = l and k2 any positive integer constant is polynomially
solvable if one of the directed graphs G,, or G; is acyclic.

PROOF. Because of space considerations, the proof is left to the
Supplementary Document. I

2.3 The CAMPways alignment algorithm

Although Proposition 2.2 provides a positive result, it is restrict-
ive to be useful in practice. We provide a more general algorithm
that although may not ﬁnd the optimum in all cases, will in
general produce high-quality alignments. Assuming Gk, Gg‘,
the constants k1,k2, and a homological similarity value between

the pair (qu, ung) for any node qu in G; and any node ung in
Gg‘, the algorithm consists mainly of three steps. These major
steps are depicted in Figure 1 on a sample input pathway pair.

StepI-Constructing the bipartite Similarity Graph: This step
involves the construction of Cons(qu) for every node qu in
G; such that |Cons(qu)| 5 k1 and Cons(uR}) for any node ung
in Gg‘ such that |Cons(uR3,)| 5 k2. Assuming an edge-weighted
bipartite graph on the set of nodes of G; in one partition and
those of Gg‘ in the other, where each weight represents the homo-
logical similarity of the pair of nodes, a reasonable goal is to ﬁnd
out a subset of edges that satisﬁes the degree constraints k1,k2
and that maximizes the sum of edge weights in the output subset;
see Figure 1 where the weight is depicted through the thickness of
bipartite graph edges in the similarity graph. The problem then
turns into that of b-matching (or the degree constrained subgraph
problem), which has been studied fairly well starting with the
pioneering work of Edmonds (1965). Polynomial time solutions,
including appropriate modiﬁcations of the network ﬂow algo-
rithms (Gabow, 1983) and belief propagation methods (Bayati
et al., 2011), have been suggested. For efficiency considerations,
we choose to use a simple greedy algorithm for this step. Each
time the algorithm selects the heaviest edge that does not violate
the degree constraints k1,k2 for neither of the end points and
extends the output set with the edge. The algorithm stops when
there are no more edges to consider, and the bipartite graph
resulting from the output set of edges is the similarity graph, S.

S tepZ-Conﬂict Graph Generation and Conﬂict Resolution:
Assume the bipartite similarity graph S is extended with the
directed edges of Gk, Gg‘, that is, directed edge (qu, uRy) is in-
serted in S for qu and uRy in Gk, if (qu, big) is an edge in GE.
Analogous extensions apply to edges of G; We construct an
undirected node-weighted conﬂict graph C, where each node cor-
responds to a set of four nodes providing a conserved edge in the
extended graph S. More precisely, in the conﬂict graph, there is a
node corresponding to 4—tuple < qu, uRy, um, ung > if and only
if all of the following hold:

(i) RXORy =0 andR;OR/y=0.
(ii) Either (qu, uRy), (um, ung) are in Gk, Gg‘, respectively, or
(uRy, qu), (ung, uRQ) are in GE, Gg‘, respectively.
(iii) {qu, uRiv}, {uRy, ung} are undirected edges in S.

Denote such a 4—tuple with a c4, as the underlying undirected
subgraph induced on the four nodes gives rise to a 4—cycle. A
weight of 1 is assigned to the c4s satisfying only one part of con-
dition ii, and a weight of 2 is assigned to those satisfying both
parts of ii. It should be clear that each c4 node in the conﬂict
graph represents a pair of reaction subset mappings that gives
rise to at least one conserved edge. Furthermore, the weight of
the node provides the number of edges conserved as a result of the
pair of mappings. The conﬂict graph depicted in Figure 1 is the
exact conﬂict graph corresponding to the partially depicted ex-
tended similarity graph in the figure. Note that although the
structure of the 4—tuple < uRg, uRZ, uR/5 , uR/6 > resembles that of
a c4, that is, conditions ii and iii defined earlier in the text are
valid, it does not correspond to a node in the conﬂict graph, as
condition i is not satisﬁed. Regarding the weights, it should be
noted that the node < uR1, uR; , my4 , my5 > has weight two, and the
rest has weight one in the conﬂict graph depicted in the figure.

(Partial) Conﬂict graph

Fig. 1. CAMPways algorithm depicted on a sample input for k=2; the ﬁnal alignment includes 1-to-1 and 1-to-2 mappings of reactions. First step
involves b-matching; degrees of nodes are bounded by k1 or k2 depending on the partition they belong to in the similarity graph. Only a small
representative portion of the extended similarity graph is shown. The conﬂict graph arising from this portion is shown exactly. All the alignments in
the M WIS boxes of the loops in Steps 1 and 2 and in the M WIS box of the ﬁnal expansion step are included in the output alignment. Note that the
conﬂict graph deﬁnitions within the loops and that of the ﬁnal expansion phase are different

Let C 1 = < “R,” “Ry: “pr MR3, >, C2 = < MRW, “R2: “R0: “R; >
and let S1 6 {RX,Ry},S2 e {RW,RZ} and
S/1€{R;,R/y},S/2€{R:V,R;}. For a c4 Ci, let Mc,(u) indicate
the neighbor of u in C,- from the opposite network. There exists
an edge between the nodes corresponding to the two c4s in the

conﬂict graph if and only if at least one of the following holds:

(i) EISl,S2 such that S1 75 S2 and S1 (1 S2 75 0.

(ii) EIS’ , S/2 such that S1 75 S2 and S1 (1 S2 75 0.
(iii) ElSl, S2 such that S1 2 S2 and MC,(S1) 7E Mc2(S2).
(iv) EIS/ , S/2 such that S1 2 S2 and Mc,(S/l) 7E Mc,(S/2).

This construction implies that an edge exists between a pair of c4s
if and only if the pair of conserved edges represented by the c4s
can not coexist in any legal alignment. For the conﬂict graph
of Figure 1 for instance, the edge between the c4s
< uR,,uR,, uRg,uR/5 > and < uR2,uR4, uR/6,u1;u7 > is due to condi-
tion i; reaction subsets R9 and R2 share a reaction. Therefore, no
legal alignment can include both of the corresponding
conserved edges. On the other hand, the edge between
< uR,,,uR5,uR/7,uR/15 > and < uR2,uR4,uR/6,uR/5 > is due to iii.
Simultaneously conserving both edges corresponding to both
c4s, R4 would have to be mapped to two different reaction sub-
sets, which is not possible in any legal alignment by deﬁnition.
The discussion regarding the conﬂict graph construction leads to
the following proposition:

PROPOSITION 2.3. The maximum weight independent set
( M WIS ) of C provides an optimum solution to the constrained
alignment problem.

However, some modiﬁcations are necessary to make our con-
ﬂict graph model more useful in practical applications of the
constrained alignment framework. First, each node in the

conﬂict graph may not necessarily have an exact binary
contribution, that is, 1 or 2 to the quality of the ﬁnal alignment.
Therefore, we propose appropriate generalizations for the
weights of conﬂict graph nodes. We provide two alternative
weighting schemes. For a given edge e in the similarity graph
S, let ws(e) denote the weight of e, which reﬂects the homological
similarity of the reaction subsets corresponding to the
end points of e. For C1 =< qu,uRy,uR;,uR; >, the ﬁrst
scheme, denoted with W1, assigns a weight of
at x H(C1) + (l — at) x [(Cl), where

For the computation of I(C 1), the total number of directed edges
between RX, Ry and between R3,, R} is normalized with the max-
imum number of possible directed edges GS, Gg‘ in any c4. The
parameter at is a balancing parameter between the weight of
homological similarity and that of conserved interactions. Our
second weighting scheme does not check the number of con-
served edges; as long as there is at least one conserved edge,
the contribution of edge conservation remains the same. On
the other hand, depending on the evolutionary distance of the
organisms providing the input pathways, it might be more mean-
ingful do differentiate between the alignments yielding one-
to-many mappings as opposed to those providing one-to-few
mappings. Therefore, for the second scheme, denoted with W2,
we introduce additional input parameters a1,a2 . . . ark such that
a1 + a2 + -s + ark = 1. Each a,- reﬂects the relative importance of
the one-to-i mappings in the complete alignment. Without loss of

generality, let |RX| > = |R§c| and |Ry| > = |R/y|. The weight of
C1=< qu,uRy,uR;,uR} > is defined as
alel X  +0l|Ry| X 

A second issue is related to resolving conﬂicts, that is, the
computation of the MWIS of the conﬂict graph. The problem
is NP-complete in general (Garey and Johnson, 1979). Several
greedy heuristics have been investigated in Sakai et al. (2003). We
implemented each and applied extensive tests to determine their
performances. The GWMIN2 heuristic, which selects the node u
in the conﬂict graph C that maximizes W(u)/ ZveNg(u)W(v),
where NZ?(u) denotes the neighborhood of u in C together with
the node u itself, provided better results than the rest.
Furthermore, it provides a theoretical guarantee that the
weight of the output independent set is at least
Zue VC [W(u)2/ 2,61%") W(v)], where Vc denotes the vertex set
of the conﬂict graph C. Therefore, we chose to implement this
part of our algorithm using this heuristic.

Finally, we note that the resulting mappings are those limited
to the edges of the bipartite similarity graph S constructed after
Step]. To enlarge the alignment, we remove all mapped nodes
from GE, Gg‘ after the execution of Step] and Step2, restore all
the homological similarity edges and repeat both steps. This
whole process is iterated until convergence, that is, the conﬂict
graph C generated after Step2 becomes empty. For the example
pathway alignment of Figure 1, the loop iterates only once; the
remaining extended similarity graph contains nodes deﬁned on
reaction subsets R6, R7, R13 and R8, which gives rise to an empty
conﬂict graph.

Step3—Final Alignment Expansion: The iterative process invol-
ving the ﬁrst two steps aforementioned produces mappings based
on 4—tuples because of the conserved interaction maximization
goal of the constrained alignment framework. The convergence
of the process implies that no more conserved interactions can be
attained. However, there may still exist potential mappings with
high-homological similarity that might be added to the align-
ment. To implement such an expansion, we first remove all the
mapped nodes from Gk, Gg‘ and restore all homological similar-
ity edges. Considering the resulting similarity graph S, we create
a new type of a conﬂict graph, called the expansion conﬂict graph.
Each node in the expansion conﬂict graph corresponds to a
2—tuple < qu, uR/v > such that {qu, uR/V} is an edge in
S. There is an edge between two nodes of this conﬂict graph if
and only if the intersection of their reaction subsets coming from
the same pathway is non-empty; see Figure 1 for the expansion
conﬂict graph generation on the sample pathways. Note that the
conﬂict graph deﬁned in Step 2 is conceptually different from
the expansion conﬂict graph of this step. We ﬁnally apply the
GWMIN2 heuristic to resolve the conﬂicts in the expansion con-
ﬂict graph, and the alignment is expanded with the mappings
corresponding to the resulting nodes.

3 DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

The CAMPways implementation is in C++ using the LEDA
library (Mehlhorn and Naher, 1999). Source code, useful scripts
for testing and evaluations, all the data and output results are
available as part of the Supplementary Material. We experi-
mented on data from the KEGG database (Kanehisa et al.,
2012) as retrieved and reformatted by Ay et al. (2011). Our

comparative performance evaluations presented in this section
are with regards to those achieved in SubMAP (Ay et al.,
2011), as the used problem deﬁnitions are the same; the goal
being one-to-many mappings for an input pair of pathways.
We note that although a version of SubMAP using network
compression to speed-up the original algorithm has appeared
recently (Ay et al., 2012), lack of publicly available implementa-
tion made further extensive comparisons with the new version
impossible. Nevertheless, it is suggested that the compression-
based version is provided mainly for execution performance at
the expense of output alignment qualities. Therefore, in terms of
alignment qualities, it is sensible to compare CAMPways with
SubMAP. According to the reported results of Ay et al. (2012),
attaining considerable runtime efﬁciency could cost an accuracy
loss of almost 50%, where accuracy is measured in terms of the
Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between the alignment outputs
of the compressed version and the original version of SubMAP.
Our experimental results on the other hand indicate that not only
does our algorithm provide superior runtime efficiency but also
achieves this without incurring any cost on accuracy; to the con-
trary, the alignment outputs provided by CAMPways provide
better accuracies than those of the original SubMAP algorithm.

Although the KEGG database provides pathways under de-
tailed metabolism categories, such as Glycerolipid metabolism
and Tryptophan metabolism among many others, directly using
these pathways in a network alignment study does not reveal
enough information. The most important reason is the lack of
a gold standard to be the basis of an objective evaluation of the
alignment qualities. Although less serious, the small pathway
sizes constitute yet another problem. Predicting the behavior of
a possible alignment method at this scale may not lead to reliable
conclusions. A mechanism to handle both of these issues is to
merge all pathways from detailed metabolism categories that are
categorized under the same more general metabolism categories
provided in KEGG. Considering the ﬁrst 11 of the listed high-
level categories, we merged all pathways speciﬁed under each
into a larger metabolic network. This way we obtained 11 meta-
bolic networks in total, each corresponding to one of the follow-
ing metabolisms: 1.1 carbohydrate metabolism, 1.2 energy
metabolism, 1.3 lipid metabolism, 1.4 nucleotide metabolism,
1.5 amino acid metabolism, 1.6 metabolism of other amino
acids, 1.7 glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, 1.8 metabolism
of cofactors and vitamins, 1.9 metabolism of terpenoids and
polyketides, 1.10 biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites
and 1.11 xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism. The
number of pathways contained in each larger metabolic network
changes between 2 and 15. The subjects of all experimental evalu-
ations of this section are these metabolic networks from pairs of
different species.

The next two subsections provide our comparative experimen-
tal evaluations with regards to the accuracies of output align-
ments produced by CAMPways and SubMAP. We used two
types of accuracy parameters for this purpose. The ﬁrst one is
based on reverse engineering successes of the output alignments,
whereas the second one is based on their biochemical signiﬁ-
cances in terms of coherence with regards to the functional
group conversion categorizations as provided by KEGG. We
ﬁnally conclude our evaluations by providing a running time
analysis of CAMPways and a discussion of experimental results

on observed execution speeds of both algorithms running on
networks under consideration.

3.1 Reverse engineering metabolic pathways

The large metabolic networks under consideration can be re-
garded as networks engineered out of small pathways on detailed
metabolism categories. A natural accuracy measure is then the
reverse engineering capabilities of the provided output align-
ments; intuitively an alignment mapping reactions that belong
back to the same original KEGG pathway is considered to be of
high quality. Thus, the pathways on detailed metabolism cate-
gories provided by KEGG become our gold standard. Note that
this approach assumes the retrieved pathways are noise-free, that
is, all pathways in KEGG are considered perfectly correct with-
out any missing data or incorrect pathway associations. Let X, X7
denote two species and G X, G} be their metabolic networks cor-
responding to some metabolism 1.m, listed earlier in the text. Let
< u Rx, uR/v > be a mapping from an alignment of GX, G}, where
RX is a subset of reactions from X and R; is a subset of reactions
from X’. Without loss of generality, let RX 2 {rx}, that is, it is the
subset containing a single reaction in the one-to-many mapping.
Let P1 . . . PX be the pathways that include reaction rx in the set of
pathways associated with metabolism 1m in the species X. We
call the mapping correct if every reaction in the subset R; is
included in at least one of the pathways P’l,  where each
PE is a pathway in metabolism 1.m of species X, corresponding
to P,- of X. We divide the experimental evaluations into two;
those regarding the alignments between species within the same
domain and those between species from different domains. We
pick Homo sapiens (hsa) and Mus musculus (mmu) as the two
representative species from the eukaryota domain, and the
Escherichia coli (eco) and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (atc)
from bacteria. The value of k: 3 is fixed, that is, each reaction
from one of the networks may be mapped to at most three
reactions from the other. For the CAMPways alignments, we

alignments of hsa versus mmu and atc versus eco with regards
to all 11 high-level metabolism categories are presented in
Table 1. Each multi-row in the table provides the results for
the alignments of two pairs of networks for metabolisms 1.1
through 1.11 from top to bottom; the top row at the mth

of total reactions of the network pair. The coverage column pro-
vides the total number of reactions covered by the mappings in
the alignment. The correct mappings column provides the
number of correct mappings in the alignment, whereas the

pings to the total number of mappings produced by the align-
ment. In each subcolumn, we indicate the name of the algorithm

provides those of the alignments produced by CAMPways with
weighting scheme W1 and at = 0.3. Alignments obtained for other
settings of or provide almost the same results as this setting. The
subcolumn marked with C2 provides the corresponding column
scores of CAMPways with weighting scheme W2 and
(1120.4, (1220.5 and (1320.1. The coverages of both algo-
rithms are similar; in some instances, coverages of SubMAP
are better, whereas in others, both versions of CAMPways pro-
vide higher coverage, although in neither case the differences are
large. With regard to the number of correct mappings,
CAMPways results are overwhelmingly superior to those of
SubMAP. For the atc—eco alignment of 1.11 xenobiotics biodeg-
radation and metabolism for instance, even though SubMAP
provides a much larger coverage than CAMPways (153 versus
134), the number of correct mappings of CAMPways is still
better (60 versus 53). This implies that although in some cases
SubMAP aggressively creates mappings in favor of covering
many reactions, in a lot of the mappings, it provides the
mapped reactions that do not share the same pathway. Over
all 22 instances, in ﬁve instances, SubMAP does not execute
until completion because of excessive memory consumption;
shown with empty entries in Table 1. For 16 instances,
CAMPways provides a larger number of correct mappings,
whereas only in one instance, both algorithms provide equal
number of correct mappings. The provided ratios also confirm

the superiority of CAMPways over SubMAP. Note that the ratio
does not normalize the number of correct of mappings with
coverage but rather with the total number of output mappings.
Thus, it is a measure of the percentage of the correct mappings in
the alignment.

3.1.2 Across-domains alignments We repeated the same tests for
every pair of species under consideration such that members in
the pair belong to different domains giving rise to four pairwise
alignment instances per metabolism. Two noteworthy observa-
tions arise. First, both the number of correct mappings and the
correctness ratios decrease for all alignments as compared with
those presented in Table 1. This is in accordance with the intu-
ition that as the divergence of the pair of species increase, any
global alignment starts providing more dissimilar mappings, that
is, mappings that match reactions from different pathways of the
given species. Second, comparing the alignment qualities of the
algorithms, the trend is the same as with the same-domain ex-
periments; in almost all cases, CAMPways provides more correct
mappings and better correctness ratios. Over all 44 instances,
SubMAP is unable to produce results in 20 of them. In seven
instances, both algorithms provide equal number of correct map-
pings. For 16 instances, CAMPways alignments induce more
correct mappings, whereas only for a single instance, the correct
mapping count of SubMAP is better. The complete table with
detailed results of the across-domains setting can be found in the
Supplementary Document.

We note that we implemented several tests to determine how
the correctness values and the number of 1-to-i mappings for
each i = 1, 2, 3 in the output alignments of CAMPways change
with respect to various a1, a2, a3 settings in the W2 version of the
algorithm. Because of space constraints, we provide a detailed
discussion regarding these results in the Supplementary
Document.

3.2 Biochemical signiﬁcance of the alignments

To compare the alignment qualities of both algorithms in terms
of biochemical signiﬁcance, we use the functional group conver-
sion (FGC) hierarchy data provided as part of the RCLASS
database of KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2012). The reactions in
the database are classiﬁed into hierarchically organized func-
tional group categories. The same functional group undergoes
the same or similar chemical reaction(s) regardless of the size of
the molecule it is a part of (March, 1985). Thus, an inter-species
alignment of a pair of pathways is considered biochemically vali-
dated if the alignment maps reaction subsets classiﬁed under the
same FGC category. There are five levels of the KEGG hier-
archy where the initial root level consists of eight high-level FGC
categorizations: carbon-related, hydrogen-related, isomerization—
related, nitrogen-related, oxygen-related, phosphorus-related,
sulfur-related and halogen-related. The correctness measure is
defined analogous to that used in the previous section; for a
ﬁxed level i of the hierarchy, a mapping is called correct if
there exists at least one category at the ith level of the FGC
hierarchy that includes all the reactions involved in the
mapping. We compare and evaluate the correctness values pro-
vided by the alignments of CAMPways and SubMAP algorithms

Note: The correspondence of the rows and multi—rows are the same as in Table l.

for the first ﬁve levels of the hierarchy starting with the root level
at i: 1.

As with the experiments of the previous section, we use two
types of evaluations; those pertaining to the same-domain align-
ments and those of the across-domains alignments. The results of
the former are presented in Table 2. The used network pairs and
the correspondence of rows, multi-rows are the same as in
Table 1. The subcolumns marked with S indicate the results of
SubMAP alignments and those marked with C indicate results of
CAMPways’ W1 version. The W2 version provides results simi-
lar to those of W1; therefore, they are not included in the table.
The main column titles indicate all ﬁve levels of the FGC hier-
archy that provide the categories relevant for the correctness
deﬁnition of a mapping. Each table entry in these columns cor-
responds to the number of correct mappings. It can easily be
veriﬁed that in all the experimental instances, the CAMPways
alignments are superior to those of the SubMAP. As the network
pairs under consideration are those of the same-domain species,
going from more abstract categorizations of the root level 1 to
the less abstract levels deeper in the FGC hierarchy, the number
of correct mappings does not decrease signiﬁcantly. We also note
that for the 1.7 glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, although
there are an average of 80 mappings for the hsa-mmu pair, both
algorithms produce few correct mappings. The ratio of the cor-
rect mappings to the total number of mappings of the alignment
is almost 6%. This is in contrast with the 90% correctness ratio
of the same pair under the reverse engineering results of the
previous section presented in Table 1. The prime reason for the

low correctness values is the lack of FGC categorizations for
most of the reactions involved in the mentioned network. This
in turn provides a potential application for the network align-
ment; the FGC category of a reaction can be transferred to those
with unknown categorizations if they belong to the same
mapping in the alignment. With regards to the results of the
across-domains setting, it can be stated that similar to the results
of Table 2, the alignment outputs of the CAMPways algorithm
provide more correct mappings than those of the SubMAP in
almost all network instances under all hierarchy levels; the only
exception is the hsa-atc metabolism 1.10, in which case the cor-
rectness values of both algorithms are already low to bear any
signiﬁcance. The complete table providing results under the
across-domains setting is provided in the Supplementary
Document.

The aforementioned analysis based on functional group con-
version hierarchies is extended to include the RPAIR data pro-
vided by KEGG on a sample mapping pair provided by both
algorithms executed on the amino acid metabolism networks of
the atc—eco pair. A reactant pair is deﬁned as a pair of a substrate
and a product that preserve chemical substructures through

enzymatic reactions. In fact, the RCLASS database classiﬁcation
also provides information regarding reactant pairs. The differ-
ence is that the classiﬁcations of RCLASS are produced by com-
puterized methods based on chemical structure comparison or
molecular alignment, whereas those of RPAIR are produced by
manually compiled reactant pairs and molecular alignments
incorporating biochemical knowledge. The sample mapping
pair provided by the CAMPways alignment is depicted in
Figure 2. The atc reactions R01374 [D-phenylalanine: acceptor
oxidoreductase (deaminating)] and R01582 (D-phenylalanine:
2—oxoglutarate aminotransferase) are together mapped to reac-
tion R01374 of eco. Additionally, reactions R00694 (L-phenyl-
alanine: 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase) and R01372
[phenylpyruvate: oxygen oxidoreductase (hydroxylating,decar—
boxylating)] of atc are together mapped to the reaction R00694
of eco. The output compound C00166 (phenylpyruvate) of the
reactions R01374 and R01582 is an input compound of the re-
actions R00694 and R01372. As a result, there is a directed edge
from the node corresponding to the subset of reactions R01374,
R01582 to the node corresponding to the subset of reactions
R00694, R01372 in the atc pathway. Similarly, a directed edge
exists from the node of reaction R01374 to the node of R00694 in
the eco pathway. This implies a conserved edge resulting from
the provided mappings. With regards to the classiﬁcations, it is
worth noting that the FGC categories of the reactions R01374
and R01582 are the same for all ﬁve levels of the hierarchy,
which further strongly validates the mapping involving these
reactions based on the RCLASS classiﬁcation. Both reactions
are co-categorized even at the furthest level, which signiﬁes iden-
tical RCLASS entry, RC00006. Further validation is observed
when the manually compiled and biochemically more reliable
RPATH data are examined; both reactions correspond to the
identical reactant pair, RP00289 within RPATH. In contrast,
the SubMAP mapping, including R01582, maps this reaction
and the reaction R01373 [prephenate hydro-lyase (decarboxy-
lating; phenylpyruvate-forming)] of atc to the single reaction
R01373 of eco. The FGC categories of reactions R01373 and
R01582 separate starting with the second level of the hierarchy
and thus belong to separate RCLASS entries. Furthermore,
there are no connections between the two as far as the RPAIR
database is of concern.

3.3 Execution speed and memory requirements

Assuming the degree of every node in Gp,G; is bounded by a
constant, the running time of CAMPways is 0(|Vp|210g2 lel),
where l Vpl is assumed without loss of generality to be larger than
|V;|. We provide a detailed analysis of this running time bound
in the Supplementary Document. In comparison, no explicit run-
ning time analysis of the SubMAP algorithm is provided. All
experimental results in this section are obtained by running the
algorithms on an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU 2.67 GHz with 24 GB
of memory. The required CPU times for all the tested networks
are listed in Table 3. The ﬁrst three rows correspond to the ex-
periments within the same-domain setting and the rest to those
within the across-domains setting. The total number of reactions
for each instance is listed at the subcolumns marked with TR.
The columns provide the abbreviations of algorithm names as in
Table 2. An important limitation of the SubMAP algorithm is its
excessive memory consumption; the SubMAP code could not be
executed until completion for some network pairs. For the hsa-
mmu alignment of the 1.1 carbohydrate metabolism for instance,
the CAMPways algorithm completed in <3 min, whereas the
SubMAP code after 2h of execution consumed all memory
resources before crashing. In 15 of the 17 instances within the
same-domain setting, CAMPways runs faster than SubMAP.
For the across-domains setting in 14 of 28 instances,
CAMPways provides better execution time. An important
point worth emphasizing is that for the instances where
CAMPways run faster, the differences between the execution
times of CAMPways and SubMAP are large, whereas for the
instances favoring SubMAP, both algorithms provide more or
less similar execution times. The difference between the
computational efﬁciency trends of the algorithms under the
same-domain and the across-domains settings is interesting. It
actually pinpoints the main reason behind the computational
efﬁciency differences of the two algorithms. Within the same-
domain setting, the pair of species that the metabolic networks
belong to are evolutionarily close. Therefore, the aligned
networks induce many conserved edges. In fact, these are the
instances for which application of network alignment is sensible;
simultaneous nature of the problem in terms of optimizing both
homological (high-sequence alignment scores) and topological
similarity (high-edge conservation) is most apparent in this set-
ting. Most of the reactions in the pair of networks are aligned
throughout the main loop of the CAMPways algorithm, as the
generated conﬂict graphs are large because of high-edge conser-
vation. When the pair of species is evolutionarily apart, the edge
conservation is naturally low in which case the main task of both
algorithms reduces to that of producing alignments that achieve
only high-homological similarity.

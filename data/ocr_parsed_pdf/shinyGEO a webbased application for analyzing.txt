Abstract

Summary: The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is a public repository of gene expression data.
Although GEO has its own tool, GEOZR, for data analysis, evaluation of single genes is not straight—
forward and survival analysis in specific GEO datasets is not possible without bioinformatics ex—
pertise. We describe a web application, shinyGEO, that allows a user to download gene expression
data sets directly from GEO in order to perform differential expression and survival analysis for a
gene of interest. In addition, shinyGEO supports customized graphics, sample selection, data ex—
port and R code generation so that all analyses are reproducible. The availability of shinyGEO
makes GEO datasets more accessible to non—bioinformaticians, promising to lead to better under—
standing of biological processes and genetic diseases such as cancer.

1 Introduction

The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is a public repository of gen—
omic data (Barrett et (11., 2013; Edgar et (11., 2002) that currently
hosts >50 000 gene expression datasets containing >1 million samples.
GEO is a valuable resource for identifying biomarkers of biological
processes and disease. Its datasets have been used to identify bio—
markers of HRAS and MYC pathway activity (Bild et (11., 2006), bio—
markers of monocyte differentiation in response to viral infection (Hou
et (11., 2012), and prognostic biomarkers in breast (Grinchuk et (11.,
2015; Ma et (11., 2004), bladder (Kim et (11., 2010; Lindgren et (11.,
2010) and lung cancer (Lee et (11., 2008; Tomida et (11., 2009).
Biomarker evaluation in GEO datasets typically involves data
retrieval and gene (probe) selection followed by an appropriate
statistical analysis. A differential expression analysis determines
whether the expression of a gene differs significantly across two or
more groups of samples. A survival analysis determines whether
gene expression is significantly associated with an event (such as
death from disease), through comparison of Kaplain—Meier curves

based on censored time to event data (Bland and Altman, 1998).
To facilitate data analysis, GEO provides an interactive web tool
[GEO2R; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0v/ge0/ge02r/], which allows
users to identify differentially expressed genes in GEO datasets.
However, GEO2R does not support survival analysis and is de—
signed for gene discovery rather than for evaluation of individual
genes. In addition, although specialized tools have been developed
to facilitate gene expression analysis by non—bioinformaticians
(Dancik, 2015; Gyo'rffy et (11., 2013; Rhodes et (11., 2007), there
are no available tools that allow a user to evaluate whether a spe—
cific gene is differentially expressed or associated with survival in a
specific GEO dataset.

In this paper, we describe shinyGEO, a web—based tool for per—
forming differential expression and survival analysis on gene expres—
sion datasets in GEO. In addition, shinyGEO produces publication—
ready and customizable graphics, allows for sample selection, data
correction, data export for custom analyses and R code generation
for reproducibility.

log-rank and adjusted P—values are reported

2 Methods

shinyGEO is implemented using R [https://www.r—project.org/], a
free, open—source software environment for statistical computing
and graphics; and shiny [http://shiny.rstudio.com/], an R package
for building interactive web applications. In shinyGEO, processed
gene expression datasets are downloaded from GEO using the
GEOquery package (Davis and Meltzer, 2007). P—values are cal—
culated using a two—sample t—test or one—way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) for differential expression. For survival analysis,
the log—rank test is used to compare samples with high expression
(e.g. top 50%) to samples with low expression (e.g. bottom
50%). Optimal cut points by P—value are identified and adjusted
P—values calculated using the sun/Misc package (Contal and
O’Quigley, 1999).

3 Software usage

An overview of shinyGEO is provided in Supplementary Figures S1
and S2. First, the user selects the GEO accession number for a
desired dataset, followed by the platform. The user can carry out a
differential expression or survival analysis, and selects the gene and
probe of interest. For a differential expression analysis, the user se—
lects the two or more groups to compare. Dot plots are dynamically
generated to visualize expression differences across groups, and re—
sults from the appropriate statistical analysis are displayed. For sur—
vival analysis, the user selects the survival information (i.e. the
columns from the sample data containing the time to event and out—
come information), and whether to use the median or optimal cut
point to define high and low expression groups. The corresponding
Kaplan—Meier curves are then dynamically generated and the statis—
tical results displayed. For both analyses, shinyGEO supports sam—
ple selection and data correction, and graphs can be formatted with
respect to color and axis labels. The user can also export the data
and generate the R code used for each analysis, following best prac—
tices in scientific computing (Wilson et al., 2014) to ensure
reproducibility.

4 Example application

We demonstrate shinyGEO by repeating a recent analysis which
found that high telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression
is associated with poor disease—specific survival in bladder cancer
patients (Borah et al., 2015). We analyze the dataset GSE13507,
which contains expression profiles for 165 primary bladder tumors
and 10 normal bladder samples obtained from the Chungbuk

National University Hospital (Kim et al., 2010). A differential ex—
pression analysis finds that TERT expression is up—regulated in pri—
mary tumors compared to normal bladder samples, with a low fold—
change (FC : 1.14, P : 0.013, Fig. 1A).

Following Borah et al. (2015), we limit the survival analysis to
only those patients with muscle—invasive tumors who did not receive
chemotherapy or additional treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). For
our selected patients, a cancer—specific survival analysis (using the
outcome column ’characteristics_ch1.9’) finds that high TERT ex—
pression is associated with poor outcomes (HR: 3.61, adjusted
P:0.049, Fig. 1B), consistent with the findings of Borah et al.
(2015). Raw data is exported (Supplementary File S1), and for re—
producibility we ’Save R Code’. Within R, a notebook integrating R
code and output can then be generated using the rmarkdown library
(Supplementary File S2) (Stodden et al., 2014).

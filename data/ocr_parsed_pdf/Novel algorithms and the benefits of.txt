Number of Comparisons

Fig. 1. A comparison of the number of articles presenting MS alignment
algorithms and the number of competing algorithms against with they
compare. The majority of novel alignment method articles fail to com-
pare against even one extant method

dilemmaithe current environment makes it easy to generate
many publications, yet difﬁcult to perform the sort of due dili—
gence comparison advocated in this letter. A good comparison
requires choosing among the several existing evaluation methods,
each of which highlights only speciﬁc behavior. The choice is
non—trivialiin alignment, metrics include metrics that evaluate
the alignment in isolation (Christin et al., 2008, 2010; Van
Nederkassel et al., 2006), in combination with other data—pro—
cessing steps (Ballardini et al., 2011; Lange et al., 2008), globally,
and locally. One must also ﬁnd datasets, which should include
sufﬁcient data representative of the different typical perform—
ance—affecting real—world characteristics (e.g. complexity of the
data, variability of peptide concentration, number of unique and
common peptides, extent and form of retention time shift in the
data, etc.). What’s more, there is no disincentive provided for
publishing work untested against existing methods. Thus, left to
their own devices, will the researcher ever behave in a manner
that is not in his best interest, though it is in the best interest of
the ﬁeld? Apparently, not very often. Our experience suggests
that the pattern we found in alignment algorithms applies to
algorithmic approaches in proteomics and metabolomics gener—
ally, and it may extend to other bioinformatics subﬁelds where
we have less experience.

So what is the solution? The problem, we have found, does not
lie in the lack of venue requirements for performance demonstra—
tion against state—of—the—art algorithms. Interestingly, many of
the articles with zero comparisons came from journals that
explicitly require authors to provide quantitative comparison
with state—of—the—art methods. Similarly, though an openly avail—
able group of standard datasets and metrics as described here
would greatly facilitate the evaluations petitioned for, authors in
other ﬁelds manage to provide comparisons even without stan—
dardized metrics or open frameworks for evaluation.

We suggest that greater care be taken by editors and reviewers
to require novel algorithmic contributions to contain a reason—
able comparative quantitative evaluation with existing methods.
New contributions should also include necessary elements to
facilitate future comparisons with other algorithms such as
source code and parameter setting guidance. Such an effort
will inevitably maximize the outcome of practitioner results,

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Accurate inference of genealogical relationships
between pairs of individuals is paramount in association studies,
forensics and evolutionary analyses of wildlife populations. Current
methods for relationship inference consider only a small set of close
relationships and have limited to no power to distinguish between
relationships with the same number of meioses separating the
individuals under consideration (e.g. aunt—niece versus niece—aunt
or first cousins versus great aunt—niece).

Results: We present CARROT (ClAssification of Relationships
with ROTations), a novel framework for relationship inference
that leverages linkage information to differentiate between rotated
relationships, that is, between relationships with the same number
of common ancestors and the same number of meioses separating
the individuals under consideration. We demonstrate that CARROT
clearly outperforms existing methods on simulated data. We also
applied CARROT on four populations from Phase III of the HapMap
Project and detected previously unreported pairs of third- and
fourth-degree relatives.

1 INTRODUCTION

Algorithms for relationship inference can greatly beneﬁt association
and linkage studies by detecting undeclared or misspeciﬁed
relatives, and have applications in forensics and wildlife population
management. Existing methods (Epstein et al., 2000; McPeek
and Sun, 2000; Sun et al., 2002) based on Hidden Markov
Models (HMMs) only consider a small number of relationship
types. RELPAIR (Epstein et al., 2000) examines eight types of
relationships (full siblings, parent—child, avuncular, grandparent—
grandchild, half siblings, ﬁrst cousins, monozygotic twins, and
unrelated). PREST—plus (McPeek and Sun, 2000; Sun et al.,
2002) extends this set of alternative relationships to include the
relationship types half avuncular, half ﬁrst cousins and half-siblings
ﬁrst-cousins. Algorithms for pedigree reconstruction (Berger-Wolf
et al., 2007; Koch et al., 2008; Riester et al., 2009, 2010)
partition the individuals into sets of sibling and parent—child pairs
(Blouin, 2003; Jones and Arden, 2003) and are not designed for
datasets containing distantly related individuals. Additionally, the
methods mentioned above cannot differentiate between rotated

relationships, that is, between relationships with the same number of
common ancestors and the same number of meioses separating the
individuals under consideration (e.g. aunt—niece versus niece—aunt
or ﬁrst cousins versus great aunt—niece). Distinguishing between
such relationships facilitates pedigree reconstruction from relatively
distant relationships.

We developed CARROT (ClAssiﬁcation of Relationships with
ROTations), a new framework for relationship inference that
leverages linkage information to differentiate between rotated
relationships. As suggested by Skare et al. (2009), we grouped
relationships between outbred individuals into three categories,
based on whether the individuals under consideration have one or
two common ancestors or whether one of them is the ancestor of
the other. Building on the ideas of Stankovich et al. (2005) and
Bercovici et al. (2010), we deﬁned three sets of HMMs, one for
each category of relationships. CARROT uses a novel heuristic to
decide whether one of the two individuals under consideration is
closer to the common ancestors than the other and beneﬁts from
haplotype phasing in order to distinguish between certain rotated
relationships.

We demonstrated that CARROT achieves higher accuracy than
maximum-likelihood approaches, such as RELPAIR and PREST-
plus, using simulated data. We also applied CARROT on real data
from Phase III of the HapMap Project (The International HapMap 3
Consortium, 2010). In addition to validating relationships reported
by Pemberton et al. (2010), we identiﬁed previously unreported
third- and fourth-degree relationships in this dataset.

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview of CARROT

CARROT is a framework for predicting the relationship type for a pair of
individuals from their genotypes. Similarly to previous work (Epstein et al..
2000; McPeek and Sun. 2000; Sun et al.. 2002). CARROT uses HMMs
to compute the likelihood of the genotype data under a set of alternative
relationships. Unlike existing methods. which deﬁne a different HMM for
each relationship type. CARROT deﬁnes three HMM templates from which
it generates HMMs for a broad range of relationships.

CARROT uses the likelihoods computed by all alternative models as
features of a classiﬁer together with additional features that quantify the
overall genetic sharing between the two individuals. In this work. we use the
term Identity By Descent or Identical By Descent (IBD) to refer to genomic
regions inherited from the Most Recent Common Ancestors (MRCAs) of the
two individuals. The additional features we consider are the percentage of
IBD. the number of transitions between IBD and non-IBD regions and the
haplo-frequencies of the two individuals in these regions. Roughly speaking.
the haplo-frequency of an individual A in a given genomic region is the

fraction of the reference population that has the same haplotype as A in that
region.

The use of phased data enables CARROT to assign different likelihoods to
relationships that are indistinguishable by previous methods: in the case of an
auntiniece pair. for instance. segments inherited from the common ancestors
can lie on either haplotype of the aunt. but must lie on the same haplotype
of the niece. This haplotype model. combined with linkage information
captured in the haplo-frequencies. gives CARROT a signiﬁcant advantage
in differentiating between rotated relationships compared with the existing
methods.

2.2 HMMs and factorial HMMs

A HMM is a probabilistic model for capturing the dependencies of a sequence
of observations G1 , G2, . . . , GM on a chain of unknown (or hidden) variables
S1 ,S2, . . . , SM taken from a set S. An HMM makes the following conditional
independence assumptions: ﬁrst. given Sk. Gk is conditionally independent
of all observations and hidden states. that is P(Gk|S1,...,Sk,G1,Gk_1)=
P(Gk |Sk). Second. given Sk_1. Sk is conditionally independent of all previous
hidden states. that is. P(Sk|S1, ...,Sk_1)= P(Sk |Sk_1). An HMM is. therefore.
deﬁned by a set of transition probabilities P(Sk|Sk_1). a set of emission
probabilities P(Gk |Sk) a probability distribution over the initial states.

Often. we want to infer the value of the hidden variables from the observed
variables. The posterior probability P(S 1|G) can be computed using the
forwardibackward algorithm in time 0(M |8 |2) (Rabiner and J uang. 1986).
where |S| is the number of values in S.

In a factorial HMM (Ghahramani and Jordan. 1997). the observation at
position k depends on multiple hidden variables. S which are
assumed to evolve independently. that is:

P(Sk =(_v,{,_v,3,...,_c,f)|sk_1 =(_v,{_1,_v,§_1,...,s,f_1))
T
= HP(S,:=s2|S,:_1=sli_l)

[:1

A factorial HMM where each hidden variable S12 takes values from
the set S is equivalent to an HMM with hidden variables taking values
from the Cartesian product ST. Using the latter representation. running
the forwardibackward algorithm on a factorial HMM requires 0(Ml8 l”)
time. However. by taking advantage of the independence assumptions for the
hidden variables. the forwardibackward algorithm can be modiﬁed to run in
O(MT|S |T‘H) time. which is a signiﬁcant improvement when the number of
hidden variables T is large.

2.3 Likelihood computation assuming linkage
equilibrium

We want to infer the relationship between two individualsA and B. genotyped
at a set of M unlinked SNPs. Let HA0,HA1,H30,HB1 e {A,C,G,T}M be the
two haplotypes ofA and B. respectively. GA =(HA0,HA1). GB =(H30,H31)
be their ordered. or phased. genotypes. and 9k be the probability of
recombination between SNPs k and k+ 1. Throughout this work. we assume
that 9k is the same for both sexes.

Let R be a set of putative relationships for individuals A and B. For any
relationship R e R. we want to compute the likelihood of R. or the probability
of the observed genotypes under the assumption that the true relationship
between A and B is R. LR=P(GA,GB|R). As noted in Skare et al. (2009).
assuming that A and B are not inbred. their relationship must fall into exactly
one of the following categories:

(1) A and B share exactly 2 MRCAs (e.g. full siblings. ﬁrst cousins);
(2) A and B share exactly 1 MRCA (e.g. half siblings. half cousins); and

(3) A is the ancestor of B or Vice versa.

We call relationships R1 and R2 rotated. if R1 and R2 are in the same
relationship category and the total number of meioses between the two

genB generations between the MRCAs and B. The sex of the individuals is
arbitrary.

individuals is the same in R1 and R2. Alternatively. we say that R1 is a
rotation of R2.

We deﬁned a set of HMMs for each of three relationship categories
similarly to Stankovich et al. (2005) and Bercovici et al. (2010). who deﬁned
HMMs for cousins parameterized by the number of generations between
them. Unlike these methods. the state space of our models does not increase
with the number of generations of the pedigree. Below. we describe our
HMMs for the ﬁrst type of relationships. The models for the other two cases
are derived along similar lines. Given that A and B have two MRCAs. C
and D (Fig. l). the hidden state at SNP k depends on the following binary
variables:

(1) mc(k) and mD(k) indicate whether C and D. respectively. passed the
same allele to their immediate descendants E1 and F 1. For example.
if both E1 and F1 inherited the maternal allele of C at position k. then
mc(k)= 1. If E1 received the maternal allele of C . and F1 received
the paternal allele of C . then mc(k) =0.

(2

V

mEl (k) and mp1 (k) indicate whether E1 and F1 passed to E2 and F2.
respectively. the allele of C and not the allele of D.

a'A(k) takes the value 0 if A inherited the allele that E; got from E1
(which came from either C or D) and the value 1 otherwise. That is.
a’A(k)=0. if for all i> 2. E1 got from E1_1 the allele of E1_2 and not
the allele of G14. If a’A(k)= l. we will say that there were off-chain
donations in the lineage of A at position k. a'g(k) is deﬁned in an
analogous way for the lineage of B.

(4) pA(k) indicates which of the alleles of A. HA0(k) or HA1(k). comes
from EggnA and is used to capture phasing errors. 173(k) is deﬁned in
an analogous way.

(3

V

Each of these variables refers to a different set of meioses in
the pedigree. therefore they all evolve independently from each other.
We thus model the process of generating the genotypes GA and GB
as a factorial HMM with hidden state s(k)=(mc(k),mD(k),mEl(k),
mm (k)vdA(k)vdB(k)va(k)va(k))-

P(i —> j) is the probability that a variable transitions from state i at SNP k to state j at SNP k+1, genA and genB are the generations between the MRCAs and each of A and B
(Fig. 1), 9k is the recombination probability between SNPs k and k+ 1; and a) is the probability of a phasing error. The transition probabilities for the variables 1110, mp1 , p3 and

d3 are derived similarly.

The transition probabilities for all the variables are shown in Table 1. We
now derive the transition probabilities for dA. Let genA be the number of
generations between the MRCAs and A (Fig. 1). The number of meioses
between E; and A is genA— 1. Assume that dA(k)=0. that is. the allele
that E; inherited from the MRCAs at locus k was passed down to A.
Any recombination between loci k and k+1 would result in dA(k+ 1): 1.
therefore P(dA(k+ 1): OldA(k)= 0): (1 —Qk)ge“A_l. If dA(k)= 1. then there
exists at least one off-chain donation in the genA —1 meioses between E;
and A. The probability that there are exactly n off-chain donations between

E2 andA is 2 _ 1 (1 /2)ge“A_l. Given that there are exactly n off-chain

donations at SNP k. the probability that there are no off-chain donations at
SNP k+1 is 9;;(1 —9k)ge“A-l-". Therefore:

Given s(k). we can determine the IBD status at SNP k and use population

where go is the frequency of allele c in the reference population. The rest of
the emission probabilities are adjusted in a similar way.

2.4 Relationship notation

We refer to relationship types using the notation (mrcas,genA,genB). The
variable mrcas is 2 when individuals A and B share two MRCAs and 1
otherwise. Unless A is the ancestor of B or Vice versa. gen A and genB are
the number of generations between the MRCA(s) and A and B. respectively.
IfA is the ancestor of B. then genA is set to —1. and genB is the number of
generations between A and B. For close relationships. we prefer to use the
usual verbal description. unless space is limited. Table 2 shows the numerical
notation for some common relationships.

Table 2. Numerical notation for some common relationships

 

 

Degree Relationship (mrcas, gen A , genB)
1 Full siblings (2. 0. 0)
Parentichild (1. —1. 0)
Half siblings (1. 0. 0)
2 Aunt-niece (2. 0. 1)
Avuncular (2. 0. 1) or (2. 1. 0)
Grandparentigrandchild (1. —1. 1)
First cousins (2. 1. 1)
3 Great grandparentigrandchild (1. —1. 2)
Great auntiniece (2. 0. 2)
Half auntiniece (1. 0. 1)
4 Half ﬁrst cousins (1. 1. 1)

 

For all relationships with gen A 7E gen 3, there is a corresponding symmetric relationship,
for example (1, 0, —1) denotes a childeparent pair. Note that the term ‘avuncular’ does
not specify a direction. The terms ‘aunt’ and ‘niece’ should be read as ‘aunt/uncle’ and
‘niece/nephew’, respectively.

2.5 Incorporating linkage information

HMMs that use unlinked markers have limited power to distinguish between
relationships of the same degree (Sun et al.. 2002). Linkage information can
help disambiguate such relationships. Assume. for instance. that we want
to determine whether the relationship between individuals A and B is ﬁrst
cousins or great auntiniece. An IBD block between A and B implies that
they inherited overlapping genomic segments from their MRCAs (Fig. 2).
If A and B are ﬁrst cousins. the two scenarios of Figure 2 are equally likely.
However. if A is closer to the MRCAs than B. then it is more likely that A
inherited a larger segment from the common ancestor than B [scenario (a)].
because we expect fewer recombinations between the MRCAs and A than
between the MRCAs and B. Therefore. if we compare the haplotypes of A
and B in a small window around the IBD transitions to the haplotypes of a
reference population. we are more likely to ﬁnd a match for the haplotype
of A. than for the haplotype of B.

To quantify this intuition. assume that there is a transition in IBD status
between SNPs k and k+1. and let H,»(k—w+1..k+w) be the haplotype of
individual i at positions k—w+1,k—w+2, . . .,k+w. that is in a window of
size 2w around k. The haplo-frequency of A is deﬁned as:

: Ziﬁ(H1(k—w+1..k+w),HA(k—w+1..k+w))

C
A N

 

(1)

where the sum is over all haplotypes in the reference population. N
is the number of such haplotypes. and f€(H1(k—w+1..k+w),HA(k—
w+1..k+w)) is the probability that H,»(k—w+1..k+w) is genotyped as

The positions of transitions in IBD status are estimated from the posterior
probabilities of IBD of the HMMs using two cutoffs. c1bd and cn0n_1bd.
Positions with posterior probability for IBD larger than c1bd are called
IBD. while positions with posterior probability lower than cn0n_1bd are
called non-IBD. If position k is IBD. position 6 is non-IBD. and positions
k+1...E—1 have IBD probabilities between cibd and cn0n_1bd. then we
consider k—w+1..E+w— 1 as the transition window.

2.6 Classifying relationships

Existing methods for relationship inference (Epstein et al.. 2000; McPeek
and Sun. 2000; Sun et al.. 2002) use HMMs to compute the likelihood of the
observed genotypes under a set of alternative relationships and then select the
relationship that maximizes that likelihood. As explained in Section 2.5 and
demonstrated in the Section 3. the likelihoods assuming unlinked markers
have limited power to distinguish between relationships of the same degree.
To overcome this problem. we used simulated data to train a multiclass
discriminant analysis model with the following features:

(1) the likelihoods of all the alternative models;
(2) the total number of transitions between IBD and non-IBD;

(3) the estimate of the IBD sharing. (Zk0.5p1(k)+p2(k)) /M. where
171(k) and 172(k) are the posterior probabilities of sharing one and
two alleles IBD at SNP k. respectively. and the sum is taken over all
M SNPs; and

the percentage r of transitions between IBD and non-IBD in which
CA <CB. where CA and C3 are the haplo-frequencies ofA and B.
respectively [Equation 1]. As explained in Section 2.5. when A and
B are equally distant from their common ancestors. r is expected to
be 0.5. A value of r much larger than 0.5 indicates that CA tends to
be smaller than CB. soA is more distant from the common ancestors
than B. Similarly. a value of r much smaller than 0.5 indicates that B
is more distant from the common ancestors than A.

2.7 Simulations

Phased genotypes of 165 individuals from UT. USA. with ancestry from
northern and western Europe (CEU) and 88 Tuscans (TSI) were obtained
from release 2 of Phase III of the HapMap Project. Some individuals in

the CEU population were connected in parentichild pairs. We removed the
offspring of all these pairs and combined the remaining 113 CEU individuals
with the TSI individuals. After removing SNPs with minor allele frequency
smaller than 1% in the combined CEU-TSI population. we obtained a set of
1 133 686 SNPs. which we call the linked set of SNPs. SNPs in the linked set
that were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) were removed using the variance
inﬂation factor method implemented in PLINK. version 1.07. (Purcell et al..
2007) to obtain an unlinked set of 79681 SNPs. The HMMs were run on
the unlinked set. while the haplo-frequencies were computed from the linked
set.

The 201 individuals were divided randomly into two subgroups. T311“.
containing 57 CEU and 44 TSI individuals and T151. containing 56 CEU and
44 TSI individuals. TS1m was used to simulate pedigrees. while T151 was used
as a reference population. to compute allele and haplotype frequencies. Only
autosomes were simulated. Following Haldane’s model of recombination
(Haldane. 1919). we set the recombination probability between SNPs k and
k+1 to (1 —e_2gk)/2. where gk is the genetic distance between the SNPs.
Genetic maps were obtained from the HapMap Project. The genotyping error
was set to 0.9%. The window w for the computation of the haplo-frequencies
was set to 20. and the cutoffs. c1bd and cn0n_1bd. were set to 0.9 and 0.2.
respectively. These values were chosen based on the accuracy of capturing
the IBD transitions on a set of simulated individuals distinct from the training
and testing sets.

2.8 Comparison with RELPAIR and PREST—plus

We compared our method to RELPAIR. version 2.0.1 (Epstein et al.. 2000)
and PREST—plus. version 4.09 (McPeek and Sun. 2000; Sun et al.. 2002)
on simulated individuals created as described in Section 2.7. PREST—plus
was run on the same 79 681 unlinked SNPs that was used to run CARROT’s
HMMs. RELPAIR cannot handle more than 9999 markers. so. similarly to
Pemberton et al. (2010). we ran it on 5 random subsets of the unlinked SNPs
of size 9961 SNPs each. Each subset was created by dividing the 79 681
SNPs into non-overlapping windows of size 8. and then randomly selecting
one SNP from each window. The prediction of RELPAIR for a given pair of
individuals was set to the relationship predicted in the majority of the ﬁve
runs.

2.9 Inference of relationships in Phase III of HapMap

Phased genotypes of 83 individuals of African ancestry from the
southwestern USA(ASW). 165 CEU individuals. 171 individuals of Mexican
ancestry from Los Angeles. CA. USA (MXL) and 167 Yoruba individuals
from Ibadan. Nigeria (YRI) were obtained from release 2 of Phase III of
HapMap. We inferred relationships in each population separately. since.
according to Pemberton et al. (2010) there is no evidence for population-
labeling errors. For each population. we removed SNPs with minor allele
frequency smaller than 1%. SNPs in LD. as well as SNPs that failed the
hypothesis test of Hardy7Weinberg equilibrium [P<10‘4. computed by
PLINK. version 1.07 (Purcell et al.. 2007)]. and created linked and unlinked
sets as described in Section 2.7.

To reduce computation time. we ﬁrst obtained a rough estimate of the
IBD sharing by running the HMM for full siblings for all pairs in each
population. Pairs with predicted IBD percentage less than 3% were removed
from further consideration. This threshold was selected to exclude most of the
ﬁfth-degree relatives. since the accuracy of our method is small in such cases.
It is possible that some of the fourth-degree relatives were also excluded
during this process. We note. however. that the goal of this analysis was not
to exhaustively identify all the relationships in the populations studied. but
rather to demonstrate the applicability of our method on a real dataset.

For the pairs that passed the above cutoff. we ran our HMMs for
all relationships of degree up to 5. using previously reported unrelated
individuals of the corresponding population to compute allele and haplotype
frequencies. The phasing error parameter a). was set to 0.1%. To infer
the relationships of these pairs. we trained our classiﬁers on 100 pairs

of individuals for each relationship of degree up to 5 and 100 unrelated
individuals. simulated as described in Section 2.7.

We veriﬁed our predictions for the ﬁrst- and second-degree relationships
by comparing them with the relationships reported in HapMap and the
predictions of Pemberton et al. (2010). To verify our predictions for
relationships of higher degree. we detected sets of three or more individuals
that were all predicted to be related to each other and examined whether our
predictions for these individuals were mutually consistent. We were very
conservative in our veriﬁcation process. reporting newly discovered third-
and fourth-degree relationships as veriﬁed only if they had strong support
from relationships of smaller degrees.

Pedigrees were drawn using HaploPainter. version 1.043 (Thiele and
Nu’rnberg. 2005).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Results on simulated data

Comparison with maximum-likelihood methods: we compared
CARROT with two existing methods for relationship inference,
RELPAIR (Epstein et al., 2000) and PREST—plus (McPeek and Sun,
2000; Sun et al., 2002). Both these methods use HMMs similar
to those deﬁned in Section 2.3 to compute the likelihoods of a
set of alternative relationships and select the relationship within
the set with the maximum likelihood. RELPAIR only considers
the relationships such as ﬁill siblings, parent—child, avuncular,
grandparent—grandchild, half siblings, ﬁrst cousins, monozygotic
twins and unrelated. PREST—plus considers the relationships
examined by RELPAIR as well as the relationships half avuncular,
half ﬁrst cousins and half—siblings-ﬁrst-cousins [see Sun et al. (2002)
for the deﬁnition of that relationship]. Neither RELPAIR nor PREST-
plus differentiate between rotated relationships, so for example they
do not distinguish between a grandparent—grandchild pair and a
grandchild—grandparent pair.

We ﬁrst compared CARROT, RELPAIR and PREST—plus on the
set of relationships that can be handled by RELPAIR, except twins,
which are not considered by CARROT. We simulated 100 pairs
of phased individuals for each of the relationships full siblings,
parent—child, aunt/uncle—niece/nephew, grandparent—grandchild,
half siblings, ﬁrst cousins and unrelated. We ran RELPAIR and
PREST—plus on all pairs using the seven aforementioned alternative
relationships. The performance of CARROT was assessed using
10-fold cross-validation: The simulated pairs were divided into 10
subsets each containing 10 pairs from each relationship. CARROT
was trained on 9 of the subsets, that is, on 90 pairs from each
relationship, and tested on the remaining subset. This process was
repeated 10 times and the accuracy was averaged over the 10 runs.

Figure 3 shows the number of pairs that were predicted
incorrectly by each method. Although all three methods achieved
excellent accuracy for the ﬁrst-degree relationships, CARROT
clearly outperformed both RELPAIR and PREST—plus on second
degree pairs, particularly on half siblings. RELPAIR and PREST-
plus classiﬁed more than half (56 and 68%, respectively) of the half
sibling pairs as avuncular. We note that the difference in performance
between RELPAIR and PREST—plus can probably be attributed to the
fact that RELPAIR was run on smaller sets of SNPs (see Section 2.8).

We also compared CARROT with PREST—plus on the set of nine
relationships which includes the seven relationships above as well as
half avuncular and half ﬁrst cousins. As shown in Figure 4, CARROT
outperformed PREST—plus for most relationships as well as on

the haplo-frequencies of these two relationships are similar.

As mentioned above, RELPAIR and PREST—plus use HMMs to
compute the likelihoods of a set of alternative relationships and
select the relationship with the maximum likelihood. However,

max likelihood selects the relationship with the maximum likelihood; CARROT
likelihoods uses only the likelihoods as features for the Classiﬁcation. We simulated
100 pairs of individuals from each relationship and performed predictions only within
each degree. The number reported is the percentage of pairs classiﬁed in the correct
relationship.

direct comparison between these methods and CARROT can only
be done for a small set of relationships. To extend this comparison
to additional relationships, we implemented a classiﬁer that uses
the HMMs of Section 2.3 for the likelihood computation and
then selects the relationship with the maximum likelihood. This
classiﬁer can serve as a proxy for any method that maximizes
the likelihood of unlinked markers. We compared the maximum-
likelihood classiﬁer with CARROT using a set of 100 simulated
pairs of phased individuals for each relationship of degree up to ﬁve,
including all rotated relationships. We assumed that the degree of the
relationship was known, so predictions were made only within each
degree. To assess whether a classiﬁcation-based approach is better
that a maximum-likelihood approach, we also ran CARROT using
only the likelihoods as features. We observed that for relationships
of degree up to two, the likelihoods are sufﬁcient to differentiate
between relationships (Table 3). For higher degrees, the likelihoods
become less informative and the additional features of CARROT
result in a signiﬁcant increase in accuracy. Additionally, we notice
that CARROT performs consistently better than the maximum-
likelihood approach, even when we only use the likelihoods as
features. Intuitively, the classiﬁer can capture correlations between
the likelihoods of different relationships. We observed, for instance,
that when the true relationship is great grandparent—grandchild, the
likelihood of the relationship great aunt/niece tends to be increased,
but this effect is overlooked when we use the maximum likelihood
criterion.

Diﬁ’erentiating between rotated relationships: to evaluate the
ability of CARROT to distinguish between rotations of
relationships, we simulated 100 pairs of individuals for each of the
possible relationships of degree up to ﬁve, including all possible
rotated relationships. We ﬁrst assumed that the degree of each
relationship was known, and ran CARROT separately for each
degree. We started by examining the ideal case of perfect phasing,
so we set the probability of phasing errors, a), to zero.

We assessed CARROT’s accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation,
as described in the previous section: the simulated pairs were divided
into 10 subsets each containing 10 pairs from each relationship.
CARROT was trained on nine of the subsets and tested on the
remaining subset. This process was repeated 10 times and the
accuracy was averaged over all 10 runs. We deﬁned the prediction
accuracy as the number of pairs that were classiﬁed in the correct
relationship.

The value at row i and column j is the percentage of pairs of relationship i that were

(1, 1, 0): great niece7aunt; (1, 2, 71): great grandchild7grandparent.

When run on ﬁrst- and second-degree relatives, CARROT
achieved perfect performance. The results for the third- and fourth-
degree relationships are summarized in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.
The average accuracy over all the pairs of the corresponding
degree, was 83.86 and 56.89%, respectively. For the ﬁfth-degree
relationships, the average accuracy was 34.45% (full results not
shown). As expected, the accuracy of our classiﬁers drops as the
degree of the relationship increases. However, even within the same
degree, some relationships are much harder to predict correctly
than others. For example, the two half-avuncular relationships,
(1, 0, l) and (1, l, 0), are hard to differentiate from each other
and from ﬁrst cousins, since the difference in the distance of each
of the individuals from their MRCA is not enough for the haplo-
frequencies to distinguish them from a balanced relationship where
both individuals are equally distant from the MRCAs. Similarly,
although the average accuracy for the ﬁfth-degree relationships was
34.45%, the (2, 4, 0) and (2, 0, 4) pairs were predicted correctly in
48.5% of the cases.

Predictions across degrees: since in practice the degree of the
relationship is not necessarily known, we also performed cross
validation on a set of 200 pairs of individuals from each of the
relationships of degree up to 5, including rotated relationships, as
well as 200 pairs of unrelated individuals. The average classiﬁcation
accuracy was 57.5%, varying widely for different degrees: all the
ﬁrst-degree pairs were classiﬁed correctly; the average accuracy
for the second-degree pairs was 99.5%, for the third-degree pairs
76.57%, for the fourth-degree pairs 46% and for the ﬁfth-degree
pairs 23.36%. Finally, 90% of the unrelated individuals were
classiﬁed correctly. We note that there was a small decrease in
accuracy compared with the results of the previous section, because
some of the pairs were classiﬁed in relationships of the incorrect
degree, while this was never the case when only within-degree
predictions were made. Table 6 shows the percentage of pairs that
were classiﬁed in a relationship of the correct degree for each of the
degrees examined. On average, the correct degree was predicted for
89.83% of the pairs.

The eﬁ’ect of phasing errors: the phasing error rate is deﬁned as
the proportion of successive pairs of heterozygote SNPs that are
phased incorrectly with respect to each other. To examine the effect
of phasing errors on the classiﬁcation accuracy of CARROT, we
simulated 100 pairs of individuals for each of the third-degree

relationships, introduced phasing errors at various rates in the
range 0—1% and performed 10-fold cross-validation, as described
above. We observed that, as the phasing error increased from
0% to 1%, there was an almost linear decrease in classiﬁcation
accuracy from 84% to 67.57%, although for phasing errors in
the range 00—01%, the accuracy was almost unaffected. Current
algorithms for statistical phasing of genotype data, such as BEAGLE
(Browning and Browning, 2007), have phasing error rates ranging
between 0.05% and 6%, depending on the number of genotyped
individuals and markers. Recently, however, Fan et al. (2011) and
Yang et al. (201 1) proposed new experimental techniques for whole-
chromosome haplotyping, which promise to achieve much smaller
error rates than current methods. Given these recent developments in
phasing techniques, we believe that the phasing error requirements
of our algorithm are realistic.

3.2 Inference of relationships in Phase III of HapMap

Phase III of the HapMap dataset contains genotypes of 1184
individuals from 11 populations in more than a million SNPs.
To facilitate phasing, many of these individuals are connected in
trios (two parents and an offspring) or duos (a parent and an
offspring). Recently, however, Pemberton et al. (2010) discovered
many additional ﬁrst- and second-degree relationships in the
HapMap collection. We applied CARROT on four of the 11
HapMap populations: 83 individuals of African ancestry from the
southwestern USA (ASW), 165 individuals from UT, USA, with
ancestry from northern and western Europe (CEU), 171 individuals
of Mexican ancestry from Los Angeles, CA, USA (MXL) and 167
Yoruba individuals from Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI). These populations
were selected because they contained both previously reported

ﬁrst-degree relationships and additional relationships detected by
Pemberton et al. (2010). Since Pemberton et al. (2010) did not
report any relationships of degree greater than two, to verify the
novel predictions of CARROT, we identiﬁed sets of three or more
related individuals and examined whether our predictions for these
individuals were consistent with each other and with previously
reported relationships.

Table 7 summarizes our ﬁndings. For each population, we
report:

(1) the number of predictions that agreed with previously known
relationships;

(2) the number of identiﬁed pairs for which the relationship
predicted by CARROT was inconsistent with previously
known relationships but the degree of the relationship was
in agreement with previously known relationships;

(3) the number of identiﬁed pairs for which the degree of
the predicted relationship was inconsistent with previously
known relationships; and

(4) the number of identiﬁed pairs for which we could not
determine whether CARROT’s prediction was correct or not
based on previously known relationships.

We note that there are small discrepancies between the numbers
of ﬁrst- and second-degree relationships that we report here and the
numbers reported by Pemberton et al. (2010). These discrepancies
can be partially explained by the fact that Pemberton et al. (2010)
used release 3 of Phase III of HapMap, while we used release 2.
Additionally, unlike Pemberton et al. (2010), we did not include in
our analysis individuals who failed the quality control ﬁlters during
phasing.

In total, we identiﬁed 23 previously unreported third-degree pairs
and 44 previously unreported fourth-degree pairs. Figure 5 shows
one of the pedigrees we detected. This pedigree involves three
families from the MXL population, M008, M010 and M012. All
the depicted ﬁrst-degree relationships as well as the aunt—nephew
relationship between the individuals NA19660 and NA19664
have been reported previously. However, our algorithm correctly
identiﬁed the ﬁrst cousin pairs NA19664—NA19685 and NA19664—
NA19662, therefore CARROT reconstructs this pedigree even in the
absence of genotype data for the mother of NA19685 and NA19662.
A list of all the previously unreported relative pairs detected by
CARROT is given in the supplement.

The results are grouped per population and relationship degree. New Relatives are relative pairs identiﬁed by CARROT that have not been previously reported. Correct predictions
are predictions that agree with previously reported relationships. The column ‘Degree Only’ refers to cases where CARROT predicted correctly only the degree of the relationship.
‘Unveriﬂed’ relationships are those for which we could not determine whether CARROT’s prediction was correct or not.

Fig. 5. Example of a pedigree identiﬁed by CARROT: the pedigree involves
three families from the MXL population. M008. M010 and M012.

We note that, although for the CEU and MXL populations,
the accuracy of our algorithm is consistent with the simulation
results of Section 2.7, in the other two populations there was a
drop in accuracy. This difference in performance might be a result
of an increased phasing error in the YRI and ASW populations.
Additionally, in the ASW population, the degree of relatedness is
unexpectedly high, with 94 identiﬁed relationships in a sample of
83 individuals. We observed, for example, that 14 individuals from
eight HapMap families (2483, 2487, 2488, 2489, 2490, 2492, 2495,
and 2496) are connected to each other. With less than 50 presumably

unrelated individuals [there are 53 individuals reported as unrelated
in the HapMap ASW dataset, even if we ignore the relationships
reported here and in Pemberton et al. (2010)], the estimation of
allele and haplotype frequencies becomes problematic, especially
in an admixed population like ASW.

To help determine whether the previously unreported pairs
detected by CARROT are predicted correctly, we ran KING
(Manichaikul et al., 2010) on all the identiﬁed third-degree relatives.
KING uses identity by state to distinguish relatives of degree up
to three from unrelated individuals. Six out of the seven pairs
of individuals that were predicted to be third-degree relatives by
CARROT and could not be otherwise veriﬁed, were also predicted
to be third-degree relatives by KING. We thus concluded that these
six pairs are most likely true third-degree relatives. We notice that
KING correctly predicted only 13 out of the 16 veriﬁed third-degree
relatives. It is therefore likely that the last unveriﬁed third-degree
prediction for which there was a disagreement between CARROT
and KING is also a true third-degree pair.

4 DISCUSSION

We presented CARROT, a novel framework for relationship
inference that uses linkage information to infer more distant
relationships than existing methods and to distinguish between
rotated relationships, that is, relationships with the same number
of common ancestors and the same number of meioses separating
the individuals under consideration (e.g. aunt—niece versus niece—
aunt or ﬁrst cousins versus great aunt—niece). We demonstrated that
CARROT achieved superior accuracy on relationships of degree up
to four, clearly outperforming previous methods, such as RELPAIR

and PREST—plus on simulated data. We also applied CARROT on
data from four HapMap populations, ASW, CEU, MXL and YRI,
and correctly identiﬁed the vast majority of the ﬁrst- and second-
degree relatives recently detected by Pemberton et al. (2010).
Additionally, CARROT detected 67 previously unreported third- and
fourth-degree relative pairs.

A possible shortcoming of CARROT stems from its current
reliance on phased data. However, state of the art statistical methods
for phasing achieve phasing errors smaller than 1% (Browning
and Browning, 2007; Howie et al., 2009) when large cohorts and
dense SNP panels are used. Additionally, novel experimental phasing
techniques have achieved haplotyping of whole chromosomes with
accuracy of 99.8% (Fan et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011).

Methods for detecting genealogical relationships and for
disambiguating between rotated relationships can facilitate pedigree
reconstruction from cohorts such as the HapMap and WTCCC
(Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007) datasets, where
most individuals are not expected to be closely related. Existing
algorithms for pedigree reconstruction that are based on the
detection of parent—offspring and sibling pairs cannot be applied
in such datasets. In studies such as WTCCC, that are based
on the premise that the individuals in the dataset are unrelated,
putative relatives are usually removed or reweighted. Knowledge
of the exact pedigrees, however, allows a more informed selection
of the individuals to be removed. More importantly, instead of
discarding the information captured in related individuals, one
can leverage the reconstructed relationships in a meta-analysis
step. Combining the linkage analysis from multiple reconstructed
partial pedigrees with the association analysis over the remaining
unrelated individuals can potentially increase the power of such
studies. CARROT was designed with such applications in mind
and aims at bridging the gap between algorithms for pedigree
reconstruction from close relatives and traditional relationship
inference methods.

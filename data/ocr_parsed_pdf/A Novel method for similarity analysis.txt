ABSTRACT

Motivation: Biological sequence was regarded as an important
study by many biologists, because the sequence contains a large
number of biological information, what is helpful for scientists’
studies on biological cells, DNA and proteins. Currently, many
researchers used the method based on protein sequences in function
classification, sub-cellular location, structure and functional site
prediction, including some machine-learning methods. The purpose
of this article, is to find a new way of sequence analysis, but more
simple and effective.

Results: According to the nature of 64 genetic codes, we propose
a simple and intuitive 2D graphical expression of protein sequences.
And based on this expression we give a new Euclidean-distance
method to compute the distance of different sequences for the
analysis of sequence similarity. This approach contains more
sequence information. A typical phylogenetic tree constructed based
on this method proved the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we
use this sequence-similarity-analysis method to predict protein sub-
cellular localization, in the two datasets commonly used. The results
show that the method is reasonable.

1 INTRODUCTION

Bioinformatics is one of the great frontiers of life sciences, and it is
also be one of the core areas of Natural Science in 21st century.
Now, many researchers pay their attentions on protein function
Classiﬁcation and sub-cellular localization. The methods of such
studies, classiﬁed from the data characteristics, include sequence-
based methods, based on interaction networks, functional domains
and so on. The sequence-based method has two ways, homologous
and non-homologous. The non-homologous method is constructing
information from the sequence based on the chemical—physical
characters, such as the amino acid composition, the frequencies of
different sub-sequences, the interval numbers of one sub-sequences
(Al-Shahib et (11., 2005a, b; Gao et (11., 2005; Lee et (11., 2009; Li
et (11., 2009; Zhang et (11., 2009) and so on. The homologous-based
method is mainly analyzing the amino acid sequence similarity,
including the way using the alignment and the way computing the
distance of sequences, using the mathematical descriptors abstracted
from some matrixes, based on some graphical representations. The
graphical representation what do not need machine learning or

other complicated computing, can provide intuitive picture or useful
insights for helping analyzing.

Since 1983, many graphical representations of sequences have
been provided in different biological topics, such as 2D-, 3D-, 4D-,
6D-graphica1 representations of DNA sequences (Cao et (11., 2008;
Liao and Zhu, 2006; Liao et (11 ., 2005, 2007; Liu et (11., 2009; Nandy,
1996; Randic et (11., 2000a, b, 2003a, b; Yu and Sun, 2010; Yu et (11.,
2009). In recent years, many 2D graphical representations of proteins
have been proposed by Randic and others (2004, 2009) (Bai and
Wang, 2005; He et (11., 2010; Randic, 2007; Wen and Zhang, 2009).
Also, many condensed matrices were provided (Cao et (11., 2008;
Liao and Zhu, 2006; Liao et (11 ., 2005, 2007; Liu et (11., 2009; Nandy,
1996; Randic et (11., 2000a, b, 2003a, b; Yu and Sun, 2010; Yu et (11.,
2003, 2009), such as, D/D matrix in which entries represent the
quotient of the Euclidean and the graph-theoretical distance between
vertices in 2D plane; L/L matrix whose elements are deﬁned as
the quotient of the Euclidean distance between a pair of vertices
(dots) of curve and the sum of distances between the same pair of
vertices; M, M/M, CM and so on. Based on these matrices, many
invariants can be obtained for comparison of sequences. Applying
the above methods, the researchers have compared the similarities
and dissimilarities of sequences (Liao and Zhu, 2006). Also many
researchers had used these matrices in constructing phylogenetic
tree.

In this work, we propose a new Euclidean distance computing
method based on a new graphical representation composed basing
on genetic codes distribution. Then we apply this method in protein
sub-cellular localization prediction using the similarity comparisons.

2 NEW GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF
PROTEIN SEQUENCE

As we all know that the four nucleic bases A, G, T and C can build up
64 kinds of trinucleotides. Based on the reason that the second base
of a trinucleotide is associated with the hydrophobic/hydrophilic
property of the translated amino acid, Jiafeng Yu (Yu et (11., 2009)
classiﬁed the 64 kinds of trinucleotides into four categories and
proposed a 3D graphical representation based on trinucleotides. We
translated the codes into amino acids presented in Figure 1.

From Figure 1, we can get that N, K, D, H, Y, E, Q are in the ﬁrst
quadrant; R, C, G, S, W are in the second quadrant; P, A, T, S are
in the third quadrant; I, M, V, L, F are in the forth quadrant. Based
on the principles of symmetry and the nearest, we can set the 20
amino acids in the four quadrants and the two axis of Cartesian 2D
coordinate. We set three amino acids in every quadrant, and every
axis with four amino acids, two in the positive side, while two in
the negative side. S is in the second and third quadrants, so we set

it on the x-axis; N, K are near the y-axis in the ﬁrst quadrant, so,
it can be set on the positive axis of Y; M, I are also near the y-
axis in the forth quadrant, so they take their places on the negative
axis of y; E, Q are near the x-axis in the ﬁrst quadrant, so they are
set on the positive axis of x; W appears only once in the second
quadrant, for the symmetry, we put it on the negative axis of x; The
rest of the trinucleotide are set in the quadrants where they are in
Figure 1. By this method of distribution of the amino acids, based
on their distances and neighbor relations each trinucleotide can be
represented by a set of coordinate (x, y). The 64 trinucleotide can be
assigned as shown in Figure 2:

In detail, N=(0, 2), K=(0, 1), H=(1, 1),D=(1,2),Y=(2,1),
R=(—1, 2), G=(—1, 1), W=(—1, 0), C=(—2, 1), S=(—2, 0),
P=(—2,—1),A=(—1,—1),T=(—1,—2),M=(0,—1),I=(0,—2),
L=(1,—2),V=(1,—1),E=(1,0),Q=(2,0),F=(2, —1).

For every trinucleotide, we can get another component z, z = x X y;
For a protein sequence S = s1 s2 S3 S4 ... sN, where N is the length of
protein sequence, every amino acid can get a point as sl- = (xi,yi, zi).
Letting Xi=zil=1 x"; Yi=Zin21 y", Zi=22=1 1", so, every
amino acid can be represented by an another point as s; = (Xi, Y i, Z,).

There we take the ﬁrst 30 residues of the ND5 protein sequences
of Human and common chimpanzee as an example. In Table 1, we
showed the distance and the cumulative distance of every residue.

Figure 3 shows the distances of Human and common chimpanzee
based on points sl- = (xi, yi, zi). As the ﬁgure shows, the zeros in the
curve mean that at those points the Human and common chimpanzee
are identical, otherwise, two sequences are different at those points.

Figure 4 shows the cumulative distances of Human and common
chimpanzee based on points sl’. = (Xi, Yi,Z,-). In Figure 4, the
diagonal parts of the curve mean that at those points the Human
and common chimpanzee are different, while the horizontal parts
mean that two sequences are identical.

Figure 5 shows the 2D curves based on X, Y, Z components
of the ﬁrst 30 residues of the ND5 protein sequences of
Human and common Chimpanzee, from which we can get that
if the X_Human and X_common chimpanzee or Y_Human and
Y_common chimpanzee or Z_Human and Z_common chimpanzee
are not parallel, so the amino acids according to theses points are
different.

As Figures 3, 4 and 5 show that, using our method, the differences
of proteins can be found from the curves directly. There, we compute
the cumulative distances of nine ND5 protein sequences (Randié
et (11., 2009) as in Table 2.

On the whole, we ﬁnd that the proteins of ﬁn whale—blue whale and

Gorilla, common chimpanzee and pigmy chimpanzee are also very
similar. Further more, ND5 protein of opossum is very dissimilar to
others among the nine species. The results about the similarity are
consistent to the known fact of evolution.

Cluster W is a multiple sequence alignment program for DNA
or proteins. It produces biologically meaningful multiple sequence
alignments of divergent sequences. It calculates the best match for
the selected sequences, and lines them up so that the identities,
similarities and differences can be seen. Evolutionary relationships
can be seen via viewing Cladograms or Phylograms. So Cluster W
is used to compute the similarity of sequences and construct the
phylogenetic tree.

Compared with our Table 3 and He’s Table 4 (He et (11., 2010),
which was computed based on the Cluster W, we can ﬁnd that the
two tables are very similar. In the two tables, the smallest distance
is between ﬁn whale and blue whale, and the second smallest is
between common chimpanzee and pigmy Chimpanzee, followed by
Human and common chimpanzee, human and pigmy chimpanzee,
pigmy chimpanzee and Gorilla, common chimpanzee and Gorilla,
Human and Gorilla, Rat and Mouse and so on.

Also, we construct a phylogenetic tree using ﬁizzy theory based
on Table 3, which is shown in Figure 6. Immediately, we can
ﬁnd that our phylogenetic tree is consistent with He’s Figure 7,
which is constructed by Cluster W (He et (11., 2010). From the
phylogenetic tree, we can ﬁnd that the broken line between ﬁn whale
and blue whale is shortest, which means ﬁn whale and blue whale are
most similar. The second shortest broken line is between common
chimpanzee and pigmy Chimpanzee, followed by human, Gorilla,

3 A NEW METHOD FOR COMPUTING THE
DISTANCE OF TWO SEQUENCES

There are some ways to analyze the similarity/dissimilarity of
different sequences. The main is computing the distance; the smaller
value of the distance represents the more similar of two sequences.
The Euclidean distances between the leading Eigen values of some
matrices was used, that matrices was constructed from the points
of the sequences and was used to represent the sequences, which
was named as mathematical descriptors, such as E, D/D, M/M, L/L,
kL/kL, kM/kM, CM matrices (Cao et (11., 2008; Liao and Zhu, 2006;
Liao et (11 ., 2005, 2007; Liu et (11 ., 2009; Nandy, 1996; Randic et (11 .,
2000a, b, 2003a, b; Yu and Sun, 2010; Yu et (11., 2009). Further more,
some researchers used the cumulative distance of

 

 

A
z [sa<ilx.y.z >—Sb<ilx.y.z >12
':' ifA =3
E(Sa,Sb)= C B A (1)
z : papa—11m: >—sza<ilx.y.z )12
c:":' Bxc ifA>B,C=A—B

every points or the last points distances (include the every
component of points, or the angles distance) to be the sequences’

distance (Randic et (11., 2009).

[Sa(ilx.y.z>—Sb(ilx.y.z>12
=[x(Sa(i>>—x(Sb(i»]2+[y(Sa(i»—y(Sb(i»]2+[z(Sa(i»—z(Sb(i»]2

There we give a new distance computing method based on Euclidean
distance. For example, two sequences, S(1, Sb; A, B are their lengths,
respectively. If A :3, we compute the Euclidean distance directly.
Presume A > B, computing the Euclidean distance of Sa(1:B),
Sa(2:B + 1)  Sa(A —B+ 1 :A) and Sb, respectively, then get the
mean value of the A—B distances to be the distances of the two
sequences, as formula (1). This method can get more information in
the sequences, so it is more effective.

Where Sa(i|x, y, z) means the x, y, 1 components of the i-th point
of sequence Sa.

4 THE APPLICATION OF OUR METHOD

Sub-cellular localization of proteins is closely related to proteins’
function, while it is the protection of maintaining the highly
ordered cell system operating normally. Studying the sub-cellular
localization of proteins is helpful for understanding the nature
and function of proteins, understanding the interaction between
proteins and control mechanisms, and providing information for the
invention of new drugs.

Biological cell is a highly ordered structure, based on the different
distribution and function, which can be divided into different
organelles, or cells areas, such as nucleus (NU), Golgi apparatus,
endoplasmic reticulum (EN), mitochondria (MI), cytoplasm (CY)
and cell membrane (ME) and so on. Synthesized proteins are
transferred to speciﬁc organelles, for example, some of the proteins
were transferred into the extracellular or remain in the cytoplasm.
Only transferred to the correct location, proteins can be used
in various life activities in cells. If the positioning error occurs,
cell function or life will be impact badly. Proteins perform their
biological functions just only in speciﬁc cell sites. The regional
distribution of organelles can affect protein folding, aggregation and
post-transcriptional modiﬁcation process and make a great impact
on cell function. Understanding of protein sub-cellular localization
information can provide the necessary assistance for us to conclude
the biological ﬁinction of the protein, while provide the necessary
information for other studies, such as protein interactions, evolution
and so on.

There, we apply our method, the new representation and the
distance got by the new method [based on si’=(X,-, Yi, Z,)], in
the protein sub-cellular localization prediction by the similarity of
sequences. We use the 98 apoptosis proteins (Zhang et (11., 2009)
dataset constructed by Zhou (Zhou and Doctor, 2003) and the 317
apoptosis proteins dataset constructed by Chen and Li (2007b). The
98 apoptosis proteins dataset contained 43 cytoplasm proteins (CY),
30 plasma membrane-bound proteins (ME), 13 mitochondrial inner
and outer proteins (MI) and 12 other proteins (OTHER). The 317
dataset consisted of 317 apoptosis proteins divided into six sub-
cellular locations with 112 cytoplasm proteins (CY), 55 membrane
proteins (ME), 34 mitochondrial proteins (MI), 17 secreted proteins
(SE) and 52 nuclear proteins (NU) and 47 endoplasmic reticulum
proteins (EN). Dividing the sequences in the dataset into two parts,
one to be sample set, the other is used as the test set. In the test set,
one testing sequence can be classiﬁed as the class of the sequence

in the sample set which has the smallest distance with the testing
sequence. We test the prediction accuracy in jackknife test.

The following measures were used to assess the performance
of the classiﬁers used in this study: the over all prediction
accuracy ACC, individual sensitivity SEN, individual speciﬁcity
and Matthew’s correlation coefﬁcient MCC are used to measure
the prediction performance of our work. The deﬁnition is showed as
follows:

where TP is the number of true positives, FF is the number of false
positives, TN is the number of true negatives, FN is the number of
false negatives and recall is equivalent to the sensitivity.

In Tables 4 and 5, we list our results for dataset 98 proteins and
dataset 317 proteins in jackknife test, respectively. From Table 4,
we can see that the overall accuracy for 98 proteins dataset by our
method achieve 89.8%, which is higher than the covariant method
(Zhou and Doctor, 2003), the BC method (Bulashevska and Eils,
2006), the ID_SVM method and equal to the Hens_BC (Bulashevska
and Eils, 2006) method. Table 5 shows that the accuracy of our
method is higher than the ID method. This result means our method
is effective. But our method is lower than the LABSVM method
(Zhang et (11., 2009) in the 98 dataset and not as good as the ID_SVM
(Chen and Li, 2007a) and the LABSVM (Zhang et (11., 2009) method
in the 317 dataset. But as we can see, our method did not use any
classiﬁer such as Bayesian Classiﬁer and SVM (Chen and Li, 2007a,
b; Zhang et (11., 2009) or other machine-learning classiﬁers, which
can improve the accuracy by training and complicated computing,
so our method is easier to carry out and less time consuming.

5 DISCUSSION

Our new graphical representation is seeking distribution property
of amino acids from the nature of nucleotide triplets. As shown in
Figure 2, the 2D distribution of the 20 amino acids is not unique.
Our method is based on the principles of symmetry and the nearest.

While using this method in phylogenetic tree construction, we
select the sequences of only nine species. This nine species has
been used in many other articles, including DNA phylogenetic tree
construction and protein phylogenetic tree. Therefore, it has a strong
representative, and biological evolution relations of this nine species
are more clearly, really.

We proposed a new formula for computing the distance of
sequences, which can deal with the sequences with unequal lengths.
We know that mostly the lengths of sequences are not equal.
Euclidean distance is easy to miss information or have additional
information to add. Many of the existing distance calculations are
obtained special matrixes from the graphical expression, and then
raised invariants from the matrixes, at last, calculated distance of
the invariants to represent the distance of sequences. Although those
ways can handle the situation of unequal lengths too, they need to
calculate the matrixes and invariants, which are complicated. Our
method is proceeding directly from the graphic expression, to obtain
the distance between sequences and can effectively deal with the
situation of unequal length sequences.

In the sub-cellular localization, many articles used machine-
leaming methods, especially SVM method. These methods have
to set up a training set, part of the dataset, to train the model
and get the model parameters, and then use the model to test the
testing set. Therefore, this method is computationally expensive,
and complex. Our method uses the distance between sequences
to measure the sequence difference, the smaller the difference, we
think they tend to be more consistent with the location information.
Although our results are not as well as some results of machine-
leaming methods, our way just only need to calculate the distance
between the sequences, which is easy to operate.

6 CONCLUSION

In this article, we proposed a new graphical representation of
proteins based on genetic-code distribution. We applied this method
in the phylogenetic tree constructing, the result of which is consistent
with the result got from a multiple sequence alignment program,
Cluster W. Then we provided a new distance computing method
based on the graphical representation and its application in the
protein sub-cellular localization prediction using the similarity
comparisons. The results show that our new graphical representation
and new distance are more effective than some methods, although
not as good as some machine-leaming classiﬁers. But it is easier,
because only need to compute the distance, not need machine
learning or training.

However, as we can see, the result of our method is not the best,
so in the ﬁiture research; we would try to improve our method to
increase the accuracy, and test in many different datasets, expecting
our method will have general applicability.

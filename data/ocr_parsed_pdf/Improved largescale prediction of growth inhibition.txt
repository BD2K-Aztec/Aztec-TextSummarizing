Abstract

Motivation: Recent large—scale omics initiatives have catalogued the somatic alterations of cancer
cell line panels along with their pharmacological response to hundreds of compounds. In this
study, we have explored these data to advance computational approaches that enable more effect—
ive and targeted use of current and future anticancer therapeutics.

Results: We modelled the 50% growth inhibition bioassay end—point (Glso) of 17142 compounds
screened against 59 cancer cell lines from the NCI60 panel (941831 data—points, matrix 93.08%
complete) by integrating the chemical and biological (cell line) information. We determine that the
protein, gene transcript and miRNA abundance provide the highest predictive signal when model—
ling the Gl5o endpoint, which significantly outperformed the DNA copy—number variation or exome
sequencing data (Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference, P <0.05). We demonstrate that, within
the limits of the data, our approach exhibits the ability to both interpolate and extrapolate com—
pound bioactivities to new cell lines and tissues and, although to a lesser extent, to dissimilar com—
pounds. Moreover, our approach outperforms previous models generated on the GDSC dataset.
Finally, we determine that in the cases investigated in more detail, the predicted drug—pathway as—
sociations and growth inhibition patterns are mostly consistent with the experimental data, which
also suggests the possibility of identifying genomic markers of drug sensitivity for novel com—
pounds on novel cell lines.

1 Introduction

Cultured cell lines have, despite their inherent limitations, served as with their pharmacological response to hundreds of compounds

genetic makeup of a cell on a large scale. The US National Cancer
Institute (NCI) pioneered these efforts by assembling the NCI60 tu—
mour cell line panel, which, to date, has been assayed for its sensitiv—
ity to over 130 000 compounds and has been extensively profiled at
the biological level (Shoemaker, 2006). Although these cell line col—
lections have proved valuable to identify genomic markers of drug
sensitivity (Barretina et al., 2012; Garnett et al., 2012) and even led
to the development of new drugs (Adams and Kauffman, 2004), the
question now arises of how these pharmacogenomic dataset can be
meaningfully mined, both to discover cancer subtype—specific drugs,
and ultimately to aid in the design of personalized cancer
treatments.

Previous studies of the NCI60 panel include the identification of
drug mechanism of action (MoA) (Weinstein et al., 1992), visualiza—
tion tools for drug sensitivity data (Paull et al., 1989; Weinstein
et al., 1997) and drug sensitivity predictions based on the cell line
profiling data (Kutalik et al., 2008; Riddick et al., 2011; Staunton
et al., 2001; Szakacs et al., 2004). Beyond algorithmic differences,
the conceptual limitation shared by these models was the unfeasibil—
ity of extrapolating the data to novel compounds and cell lines sim-
ultaneously, as the cell line profiling data and chemical information
were separately used as predictive features and were not integrated
into a single machine learning model. To overcome this limitation,
two recent studies have pioneered the combination of drug and cell
line information [gene expression, gene copy number variations
(CNVs) and mutation profiles] on the data from the Genomics of
Drug Sensitivity in Cancer project (GDSC) for drug sensitivity pre—
diction (Garnett et al., 2012). The first study (Menden et al., 2013)
modelled the sensitivity of 608 cell lines to 131 drugs with Neural
Networks and Random Forests, thereby obtaining a coefficient of
determination (R2) of 0.64 on an external set. The second study
(Ammad—ud—din et al., 2014) applied kernelized Bayesian matrix
factorization to model the sensitivity of 650 cell lines to 116 drugs,
and obtained an R2 value of 0.32 when predicting the activity for
new drugs on a set of cell lines in the training set. The authors
showed that the combination of chemical and cell line information
indeed improved model performance, which permitted the interpol—
ation of drug activities to complete the missing entries in the bio—
activity matrix of 482 cell lines by 1 16 drugs.

In this study, we now propose the simultaneous modelling of
chemical and cell line information in a single machine learning
model to predict the 50% growth inhibition bioassay end—point
(G150) of 17142 compounds screened against 59 cancer cell lines
from the NCI60 panel. Conformal prediction was implemented to
predict the confidence intervals (CI) for individual predictions. The
integration of these different, yet complementary, streams of infor—
mation is often termed proteochemometrics or pharmacogemonic
(PGM) modelling (Cortes—Ciriano et al., 2015b;Wheeler et al.,
2013). In typical PGM models, each compound—cell line interaction
is numerically encoded by the concatenation of the compound,
<I>c(cd), and cell line, <I>c1(cld), descriptors into a single vector, namely
<I>pair(cd, old). Although this encoding approach is widely used, other
approaches exist (Su et al., 2010; Yamanishi et al., 2010). For in—
stance, in the case of kernel methods, each pair Qpairkd, old) is
encoded by the tensor product of <I>c(cd) and <I>c1(cld) (Jacob and
Vert, 2008). Subsequently, these descriptors are related in a single
machine—learning model to the specific biological readout of interest
(Cortes—Ciriano et al., 2015b; van Westen et al., 2011). In practical
terms, PGM thereby helps us to understand complex relationships
between the compound structures and cell line features and enables
the estimation of the bioactivity for (novel) compounds on (novel)
cell lines (Fig. 1a).

We curated cell line profiling data consisting of 59 cell lines that
were characterized using various genetic and proteomic profiling
methods. From this, we assembled 14 profiling datasets, denoted
here as dataset views. We benchmarked their predictive signal, and
demonstrated that the simultaneous modelling of the compound and
cell line information improves the prediction of compound potency
across the NCI6 0 panel compared with models trained on only com—
pound information. Our modelling approach permits us to interpol—
ate and extrapolate compound bioactivities to novel cell lines and
tissues in the NCI60 panel, and, to a lesser extent, to chemically dis—
similar compounds. Finally, we demonstrate that the predicted bio—
activities can be used to estimate growth inhibition patterns across
the NCI60 panel and that the predicted drug—pathway associations
are consistent with the experimental data published in the literature.

2 Methods

2.1 Datasets

The raw pGI50 values (—10g1o G150, M) for 17 142 compounds were
downloaded from CellMiner (database version 1.4) (Reinhold et al.,
2012). The mean pGI50 values were calculated when several meas—
urements were available for the same compound—cell line combin—
ation and the standard deviation of the replicates was considered as
the experimental uncertainty of the measurements. The representa—
tion of the chemical structures (with respect to the aromaticity or
stereochemistry) was normalized with the StandardiseMolecules
function of the R package camb using the default values (Murrell
et al., 2015). The final dataset consisted of 17 142 compounds ver—
sus 59 cell lines (the NCI60 panel, except for ME.MDA_N) and a
total of 941 831 data points, which corresponds to a matrix com—
pleteness of 93.08%. Table 1 summarizes the details of the profiling
datasets used to describe the cell lines.

2.2 Compound descriptors

The compounds were described with circular Morgan fingerprints in
count format, which encode the compound structures via radial
atom neighbourhoods (Bender et al., 2004). The fingerprints were
calculated with the R package camb (Murrell et al., 2015). The size
of the fingerprints was set to 256 bits, and the maximum radius of
the substructures considered was set to 2. We used the circular fin—
gerprints because they have provided high retrieval rates in compar—
able studies (Bender et al., 2009; Koutsoukas et al., 2013).

2.3 Compound clustering

The compounds were clustered using periodic two—dimensional Self—
Organizing Maps (SOMs) (Bouvier et al., 2014). Two dimensions,
here 50 X 50, determine the map size in a periodic manner, whereas
the third dimension contained the compound fingerprints. Each vec—
tor along the third dimension is called a neuron, v. The same finger—
prints used to train the PGM models served as input vectors to
the SOMs. The SOM values were initialized from a uniform distri—
bution spanning the values present in the input vectors. At
each training step, the most similar neuron to the input vector con—
sidered was updated. The conventional Unified distance matrix (U—
matrix) was calculated to delineate the clusters. The U—matrix value
associated with a given neuron, Uheightm, is defined as the average
Euclidean distance between that neuron and its eight closest neigh—
bours: Uheightm : % ZMENM Ed(v, u), where N (v) is the set of
neighbours and Ed is the Euclidean distance between neurons. A dis—
tance threshold value was then applied to the U—matrix to define the
contours of the compound clusters (Cortes—Ciriano et al., 2015c).

pound descriptors, whereas the dataset views indicated in Table 1 and four cell line kernels were used to encode the cell lines. Overall, this validation enabled us
to assess the model's performance in real-world settings, where the extrapolation to novel cell lines and compounds is often a necessary step

Random Forest (RF) models (Breiman, 2001) were trained with the
ensemble.RandomForestRegressor module of the python library sci—
kit—learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) using the following parameters: (i)
number of trees in the forest: 100 (Sheridan, 2013); (ii) criterion to
assess the quality of a split: mean squared error; (iii) minimum

number of data points to split a node: 1; (iv) minimum number of
data points in a leaf to keep a given node split: 1; (v) maximum
number of randomly selected descriptors considered when splitting
a node (mtry): dimensionality of the input space. Radial—kernel
Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were trained using the sum
module of the python library scikit—learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011).

The parameter values were optimized with a 10—fold cross—valid—
ation (CV) and a grid search. The parameter grid was composed of
the following values: (i) C: {278, 276,. . . , 22, 101, 102, 103} and (ii)
a: {278, 2’6, . . . , 22}. All calculations were performed on 16 Intel
Xeon E5—2670 processors and a total memory of 256 GB. The train—
ing times on the complete dataset ranged between 6 and 8 h.

2.5 Learning strategies

2.5.1. PGM models

In the following, we define ‘PGM models’ as those models simultan—
eously trained on (i) compound descriptors and on (ii) one cell line
profiling data set view.

' Assessment of the interpolation power with a 10—fold CV (10—
fold CV PGM) model: a given dataset was randomly divided into
(i) a training set comprising 90% of the data points and (ii) a test
set comprising the remaining 10% of the data (Fig. 1b). This pro—
cess was repeated 10 times, each time leaving out a random sub—
set of the data, which enabled the generation of predicted values
for all data points. Thus, although the test set is comprised of
compounds and cell lines that are also present in the training
data, the training and test sets are comprised of different com—
pound—cell line pairs. The interpolation power of these 10 mod—
els was evaluated on a per cell line and on a per compound
cluster basis. To this end, the RMSE and R20 values were calcu—
lated on subsets of the test set grouped by cell line (cell line—aver—
aged performance) or by the compound cluster (compound
cluster—averaged performance).

' Leave—One—Compound—Cluster—Out (LOCCO) models (Fig. 1c):
all data points annotated on a given chemical cluster were left out
as a test set; a PGM model was trained on the training set, and the
values for the test set were predicted. These steps were repeated
for each compound cluster. This scenario reﬂects the practical situ—
ation where a model predicts pGI50 values for chemically novel
compounds, and thus permits the assessment of the extrapolation
capabilities of a PGM model in chemical space.

' Leave—One—Cell—Line—Out (LOCO) models (Fig. 1d): this valid—
ation scenario is similar to LOCCO, except that the data left out
for the test set are now all of the data obtained for a particular cell
line. This scenario intends to mimic the situation where the PGM
model is employed to extrapolate the data to novel cell lines.

' Leave—One—Tissue—Out (LOTO) models: The performance of the
PGM models was further evaluated by extrapolating to cell lines
whose tissue of origin was not present in the training set. This
scheme is similar to LOCO, except for the fact that all of the can—
cer cell lines originating from the same tissue were left out from
the training set each time. It was employed because cell lines
from the same tissue, despite their genetic differences, often still
share commonalities with regard to compound activity.

To quantify the improvement of the PGM models over models ex—
clusively trained on compound fingerprints (compound—only mod—
els), the following one—space learning strategies were explored
(Brown et al., 2014).

2.5.2 Compound-only (QSAR) models

' Family Quantitative Structure—Activity Relationship (QSAR F):
the models were exclusively trained using the compound ﬁnger—
prints as the input features (Fig. 1e). A QSAR F model serves to
assess whether the explicit inclusion of the cell line information
improves the prediction of compound activity; if the PGM model

displays a performance very similar to the QSAR F model, the in—
clusion of cell line information would add little beneﬁt to the
modelling of compound activity.

' Individual QSAR models per cell line: one QSAR model per cell
line was exclusively trained on compound descriptors, which is,
therefore, not able to include information from the biological side
or measurements against other cell lines. In this case, the compari—
son was made with the compound cluster—averaged interpolation
power of the PGM models to evaluate whether the integration of
the compound and cell line information leads to higher predictive
ability with respect to the per cell line QSAR models.

2.5.3 Cell line kernels

To assess whether the explicit inclusion of the cell line profiling data
as input variables provides a higher predictive signal than the cell
line kernels (Jacob et al., 2008), which encode cell lines with a vec—
tor quantifying the similarity among cell lines in a given space (e.g.
gene expression), we trained models with two sources of informa—
tion, namely: (i) compound descriptors and (ii) one of the following
cell line kernels:

' Dirac kernel (Jacob et al., 2008) or cell line identity ﬁngerprints
(CLIFP) (Brown et al., 2014). CLIFP are binary descriptors of
length equal to the number of different cell lines considered,
where each bit position corresponds to one cell line. Formally,
CLIFP are deﬁned as CLIFP(i, /) : 5(1‘ — /)(i, j e 1, 
Nceus), where 5 is the Kronecker delta function and Nu,”S is the
number of distinct cell lines. These descriptors are simply cell
line indicator variables, and, therefore, no information on com—
pound activity across different cell lines is shared during model
training (Jacob et al., 2008).

' Multitask (MLT) kernel (Jacob et al., 2008). This kernel encodes
the cell lines in the following form: MLT(i,  : (1 + 5(i —/')
(i. j E 1. .... Nce115))/2. When coupled to SVM, this kernel de—
composes the model as a sum of two linear functions. The ﬁrst
function, common to all cell lines, learns the shared patterns of
compound activity against all cell lines (e.g. substructures en—
riched for compound activity). The second function describes the
aspects of compounds speciﬁc to each cell line. The cell lines are
located at an equal distance, and information across cell lines
can be shared during the learning phase (though their biological
similarities and differences are not explicitly taken into account).

' Cor. Transcriptome kernel. This kernel encodes cell lines by
deﬁning a Nu,”S >< Nu,”S matrix where each i, / entry corresponds
to the Spearman’s Rank Correlation coefﬁcient (rs) of the tran—
script levels (log2) of 19965 genes (Reinhold et al., 2010) be—
tween cell lines i and j.

' Cor. Proteome kernel. This case is similar to the previous kernel,
with the difference that it considers the correlation of the protein
levels of 8113 distinct proteins (Gholami et al., 2014) for all cell
line pairs.

2.6 Model validation
The predictive power of the models was assessed on the test set accord—
ing to the RMSE,“t and R20 test values (Golbraikh and Tropsha, 2002):

predicted, and 7 the average pGI50 values of those data points
included in the test set; and )7?) : $37, with s : Z mfg/237,2.

2.7 Assessment of the maximum and minimum
achievable model performance

To assess the maximum and the minimum achievable RMSE,“t and
R20 test values based on the experimental uncertainty of the pGI50
values, we generated the simulated data as follows:

' Maximum performance. A sample, A, of the same size as the test
set was randomly extracted from the vector containing the whole
set of pGI50 values. Subsequently, the experimental uncertainty
(multiplied by —1 in half of the cases) was added to each data
point in A, thus deﬁning the sample B. We deﬁne experimental
uncertainty as the standard deviation of replicate pGI50 measure—
ments. In cases where no experimental uncertainty was available
for a data point, the mean of the available replicate—averaged ex—
perimental uncertainties, namely 0.27 pGI50 units, was used.
Next, the RMSEmSt and R20 test values were calculated for A with
respect to B. These steps were repeated 1000 times, which led to
the distributions of the maximum achievable RMSE,“t and
R20 test values.

' Minimum performance. The procedure was the same as in the
previous case, except that sample A was randomized before cal—
culating the RMSEmSt and R20 test values.

2.8 Conformal prediction

Conformal prediction builds upon past experience, i.e. the data
points in the training set, to define the confidence intervals (CI) for
individual predictions, )7, with an error of 1 — e, where e is the toler—
ated error. The non—conformity score, «new, for a new data point,
xnew, quantifies how distant it is with respect to the data points from
the training set, X :  Here, the non—conformity scores were
calculated as: «new : W, where pym is the predicted error for
xnew with an error modelieThe main advantage of conformal predic—
tion is that the CI are always valid, i.e. a confidence of 0.8 means
that the predicted confidence regions will contain the observed value
in at least 80% of the cases (Norinder et al., 2014).

To calculate and validate the predicted CI, the following protocol
(Norinder et al., 2014) was implemented. First, the entire dataset was
randomly divided into an external set (20% of the data) and a train—
ing set (80%). The latter was subsequently split into a calibration set
(30%) and a proper training set (70%). Thus, these three sets include
data from the entire sets of cell lines and compounds. Two models
were trained on the proper training set, the first of which predicted
the pGI50 values (point prediction model), whereas the second pre—
dicted the errors in the prediction (error model), [2. Both models were
trained with the compound fingerprints and the ‘G.t.l 1000 genes’
dataset view as input features using the complete dataset. The point
prediction model was generated by training an RF model on the
proper training set with a 10—fold CV and with pGI50 values as the de—
pendent variable. The generated CV predictions served to calculate
the residuals (i.e. prediction errors) for the data points in the proper
training set. Subsequently, the error model was generated by training
an RF model on the proper training set using these residuals as the de—
pendent variable. The pGI50 values and prediction errors were subse—
quently predicted for the calibration set and employed to calculate the
vector of non—conformity scores for this set, which, after being sorted
in increasing order, led to: «cam, : {ucalibi};:ci“b
ponds to the number of data points in the calibration set. The a value

, where Ncam, corres—

for a given confidence level, namely u1_g, was calculated as follows:
(X1_£ : «alibi if j E (NCKHW (1 —e)j, where E indicates identity.
This corresponds to traversing the set aim)”, at its up, element, namely
1 —8. Finally, the prediction errors ([2,) and the pGI50 values (37)
were predicted for the test set. The CI was calculated as:

The average log2 gene transcript level for the genes in each pathway
of the MSigSB C2 Canonical Pathways gene set (Liberzon et al.,
2011) was defined as the expression level of each pathway. To assess
the association between the drug response (pGI50) and the expres—
sion of a given pathway, we fitted a linear model considering the tis—
sue type, T, as a blocking factor (Haibe—Kains et al., 2013), which
was defined as: pGI5o : lipP, + liq-T,- + e. where P,- corresponds
to the average expression of pathway i in a given cell line, T, to the
tissue of origin of that cell line, and e to the error term. The
lip values determined the strength of the associations, whereas their
significance was estimated by the statistical significance of [3,, (two—
sided t—test, u : 0.05 ).

3 Results

3.1 Summary of the cell line profiling dataset views

We collected seven profiling datasets for 59 cell lines from the
NCI60 panel, excluding ME.MDA—N due to the lack of gene tran—
script microarrays (Table 1). These molecular/phenotype datasets
were combined in a variety of ways, which we termed dataset views
in analogy to database views (Costello et al., 2014). The dataset
views may consist of (i) a profiling dataset, (ii) a subset thereof, e.g.
gene transcript levels of gene sets or (iii) a modification of the
dataset to which prior knowledge is added, e.g. the calculation of
pathway expression levels based on knowledge of the cell signalling
networks. A total of 14 dataset views were defined, which are sum—
marized in Table 1 and provided in the Supplementary Material.

In addition to the complete dataset, comprising all available data
and including 17 142 distinct compounds (Supplementary Table S8)
and 941 831 data points, we assembled three additional datasets: (i)
the uncorrelated bioactivities 0.5 dataset, comprising 3641 distinct
compounds (199 940 data points) whose bioactivity distributions on
the 59 cell lines exhibit standard deviations higher than 0.5 pGI50
units (Supplementary Table S9); (ii) the uncorrelated bioactivities 1
dataset, comprising 165 distinct compounds (9376 data points)
whose bioactivity distributions on the 59 cell lines exhibit standard
deviations higher than 1 pGI50 unit (Supplementary Table S10); and
(iii) the big/7 confidence dataset, exclusively comprising data points
averaged over at least two experiments (304212 data points and
5302 distinct compounds). The uncorrelated bioactivities 0.5 and 1
datasets served to assess the models’ performance on compounds
displaying a dynamic range of bioactivities across the cell line panel,
while the latter dataset served to evaluate whether the models’ per—
formance improves when using replicate—averaged cell line sensitiv—
ity data (Supplementary Table S1 1 for details).

3.2 Chemical space characterization

To assess the chemical diversity in the data, we clustered the 17 142
compounds with SOMs (Supplementary Figure S1 and Section 2.3),
which resulted in the definition of 31 distinct chemical clusters.
Several clusters, e.g. 4 and 18, are highly homogeneous, as high—
lighted by the high inter—neuron similarity (blue areas in
Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, other clusters are comprised of

more diverse compounds (shown in red in Supplementary Fig. S1).
For instance, cluster 2 (Supplementary Table S8) is composed of
polycyclic aromatic compounds with diverse halogen substituents
and topologies. The definition of structural clusters will be em—
ployed later to examine the extrapolation power of the PGM models
to chemically dissimilar structures.

3.3 Comparison between RF and SVM

Although the statistical robustness of RF to model the chemical and
biological data simultaneously has been empirically shown (Menden
et al., 2013), the mathematical notions by which information is
shared across compounds and cell lines are poorly understood.
Given that a comparison between the multi—task learning capabil—
ities of RF and SVM in the field of pharmacogenomics is lacking, we
first compared their performance in 10—fold CV when trained on the
uncorrelated bioactivities 1 dataset using (i) compound fingerprints
and (ii) either gene expression data or a cell line kernels as the input
features (Fig. 2a). We did not find statistically significant differences
in the performance between the RF and SVM 10—fold CV PGM
models trained on compound fingerprints and the dataset view
‘G.t.l. 1000 genes’ (P < 0.05). The performance of these models was
comparable to that of the 10—fold CV PGM models encoding cell
lines with the cor. GE and MLT kernels trained with RF and SVM,
respectively (P<0.05, labelled with ‘a’ in Fig. 2). Hence, in this
dataset, encoding cell lines with kernels that are naive with respect
to the nature of the genomic makeup of the cell lines, in this case the
MTL kernel, provides virtually the same predictive signal as the
gene expression data, i.e. the ‘G.t.l. 1000 genes’ dataset view.
Interestingly, the performance of SVM and RF across the cell line
kernels explored was not constant, as the RF models outperformed
SVM when using the cor. Proteome and Dirac kernels to encode cell
lines, whereas the SVM models outperformed RF in the case of the
MLT kernel, thus highlighting that information across compounds
and cell lines is not shared in a similar way across RF and SVM.
Based on the comparable predictive power of RF and SVM, we used
RF to train all of the models presented in the following sections be—
cause RF (i) requires smaller training times than the kernel methods
and (ii) are robust with respect to the value of their parameters
(Supplementary Fig. S2 and Sheridan, 2013).

3.4 PGM model validation

The PGM models trained on the complete dataset with 10—fold CV
using compound fingerprints and the dataset view ‘G.t.l 1000 genes’
as input features exhibited mean RMSEmSt and R20 test values of
0.40 i 0.00 pGI50 units and 0.83 i 0.00 (n: 10), respectively.
These values were consistent with the theoretical maximum and
minimum achievable performance, which were 1.42 and 0.35 pGI50
units, respectively, for the RMSEmSt and 0.96 and—0.96, respect—
ively, for the R20 test (Supplementary Fig. S3). Moreover, the model
performance did not stem from chance correlations, as R20 test values
became negative when 75% of the pGI50 values were randomized
(Clark and Fox, 2004) (Supplementary Fig. S4). Modelling the big/7
confidence dataset led to a similar performance, with an RMSEmSt
of 0.45 pGI50 units and an R20 test value of 0.84. This indicates that
the predictive power of RF does not decrease when we included the
data points measured in only one experiment, which is in agreement
with a recent benchmarking study on the noise sensitivity of ma—
chine learning algorithms in bioactivity modelling (Cortes—Ciriano
et al., 2015a). The 10—fold CV PGM models were further evaluated
on the uncorrelated bioactivities 0.5 dataset, where RMSE,“t and
R20 test values of 0.58 pGI50 units and 0.79, respectively, were

Fig. 2. Comparison between (i) RF and SVM and (ii) the cell line kernel and

was compared on the uncorrelated bioactivities 1 dataset across the cell line
kernels explored and the data set view ‘G.t.l. 1000 genes' (Table 1). The CV
RMSE,est values on the left out sets in CV were used as a proxy to monitor the
predictive power of the models. RF and SVM trained on the ‘G.t.l. 1000 genes'
dataset view displayed comparable predictive power, whereas RF and SVM
exhibited diverse performance across the cell line kernels used in this study.
Models sharing a letter label performed at the same level of statistical signifi-
cance (Tukey's HSD, 0:20.05). The blue points indicate the median and the
interquartile range (25th—75th percentile), whereas the red points indicate the
mean RMSE,est value. (b) Comparison between the individual QSAR and
PGM models. The 10-fold CV Ind. QSAR models were trained on increasingly
larger training sets and their performance was assessed on the left out data
(orange). Thus, each point in the figure corresponds to the average 10-fold
CV RMSE,est value across 59 models (one per cell line). The 10-fold CV PGM
models were trained jointly on the compound and cell line descriptors (‘G.t.l.
1000 genes' dataset view). For each model, the training set comprised a frac-
tion of the data annotated on a given cell line (X—axis) and a percentage of the
data annotated on the remaining cell lines (indicated in the legend). Overall,
lower RMSE,est values are obtained when integrating information from sev-
eral cell lines, indicating that the PGM models enable us to share information
across cell lines and compounds, thereby outperforming the individual QSAR
models

observed. These RMSE,“t and R20 test values were also in agreement
with the maximum achievable performance estimated for the uncor-
related bioactivities 0.5 dataset (Supplementary Fig. S5).

3.5 Comparisons between the PGM and QSAR models

To test whether the PGM models display higher predictive power
than per cell line QSAR models, we trained (i) the individual QSAR
10—fold CV RF models with increasingly larger training sets, whose
performance was assessed on the held—out data (orange in Fig. 2), on
the uncorrelated bioactivities 1 dataset and (ii) the 10—fold CV PGM

RF models on the compound and cell line descriptors (‘G.t.l. 1000
genes’ dataset view). In the latter case, the training set comprised an
increasingly larger percentage of the data annotated on a given cell
line (x—axis in Fig. 2) and an increasingly larger percentage of the
data annotated on the remaining cell lines (indicated in the legend of
Fig. 2). We consistently obtained lower RMSEmSt values with the
PGM models than with the individual QSAR models, indicating that
PGM modelling enables the sharing of information in the biological
and chemical space. Likewise, the RMSE,“t values systematically
decreased as more data were added to the training set in the PGM
models. The biggest RMSEmSt difference between the individual
QSAR and the PGM models were obtained when the least amount
of data (5 or 10%) was assigned to the training set, whereas the low—
est difference was found when almost all of the data available on a
given cell line was used for training. This indicates that integrating
data across different cell lines seems more beneficial when the data
are relatively scarce.

On the complete dataset, the 10—fold CV PGM models slightly
outperformed models trained exclusively on compound descriptors,
namely QSAR F, with RMSE“... and R20 m values of 0.45 pGI50
units and 0.78, respectively. These results indicate (compared to an
RMSE,“t value of 0.40 pGI50 units and R20 test20.83 for the 10—
fold CV PGM model) that the pGI50 values of the compounds are
largely correlated across the cell line panel. However, the 10—fold
CV PGM models increased the relative performance over the QSAR
F models on the uncorrelated bioactivities 0.5 dataset, with respect—
ive RMSEmSt values of 0.58 versus 0.69 pGI50 units, respectively,
highlighting the finding that the PGM models appear to be more
suitable for modelling compounds exhibiting an uncorrelated pGI50
value on a cell line panel. Moreover, the 10—fold CV PGM models
significantly outperformed individual cell line models, i.e., QSAR
(two—sided t—test, u : 0.05, P < 0.05), trained on the data points cor—
responding to a given cell line that exclusively used the compound
descriptors as the input features. These individual models dis—
played an average RMSEmSt value of 0.73 i 0.05 pGI50 units
(Supplementary Table S12). Therefore, integrating the biological in—
formation from different cell lines in a single PGM model improves

the compound sensitivity prediction on the NCI60 panel over the
QSAR models, and even more so in cases where activities across cell
lines show less of a correlation.

3.6 Benchmarking the cell line profiling datasets

To benchmark the predictive signal across the 14 dataset views, we
used the uncorrelated bioactivities 0.5 dataset, as it contains the
compounds displaying the least correlated pGI50 values on the cell
line panel and thus is more challenging to model. For each dataset
view, we trained a 10—fold CV PGM model using that dataset view
and the compound fingerprints as the input features, which resulted
in a total of 140 models (14 data set views X 10 CV folds). An ana—
lysis of variance (ANOVA) on the RMSEmSt values (Fig. 3a) yielded
significant differences between the models (P < 1 X 10717). Similar
to previous reports (Costello et al., 2014; Jang et al., 2014), we have
also observed that the gene transcript levels led to the highest pre—
dictive power, with median RMSEmSt values in the 0.56—0.58 pGI50
units range (Fig. 3a). However, the combination of transcript levels
from different gene sets, e.g. kinases and ABC transporters (Fig. 3a),
did not translate into increased performance, suggesting that these
dataset views might contain redundant predictive signal. In addition,
there were no significant differences in performance between the
models trained on the gene transcript levels and those trained on the
miRNA abundance or RPLA data [Tukey’s Honestly Significance
Difference (HSD), P value < 0.05]. Interestingly, the performance of
the models trained on the CNV or exome sequencing data was sig—
nificantly worse (Fig. 3a), with RMSEmSt values in the 0.63—0.68
pGI50 units range. This poorer performance could possibly be ex—
pected given the sparseness of these data, as the percentage of non—
zero entries in the CNV and exome—seq matrices is 2.66 and 0.03%,
respectively.

3.7 Bioactivity interpolation to the cell lines and
compound clusters present in the training set

The interpolation power of the 10—fold CV PGM models was eval—
uated by calculating the RMSEmSt values on subsets of the test set

Fig. 3. Benchmarking the cell line profiling dataset views for the cell line sensitivity prediction. (a) The predictive power of the 14 dataset views (Table 1) and two
cell line kernels, namely cor. Proteome and cor. Transcriptome, was quantified by the RMSE values on the test set. For each dataset view, we trained the 10-fold
CV PGM models on the uncorrelated bioactivities 0.5 dataset. We found significant differences among the dataset views (ANOVA, P< 0.01). Post-hoc analyses
(Tukey's HSD, or: 0.05) were used to cluster the dataset views according to their predictive power. Dataset views sharing a letter label performed at the same
level of statistical significance. We consistently found that the gene transcript levels and the abundance of proteins and miRNA led to the most predictive models
(labelled with ‘a'). (b) The evaluation of both interpolation and extrapolation power was evaluated on the complete dataset. After finding significant differences
across groups (ANOVA, P< 0.01), we found that the PGM models interpolate and extrapolate to new cell lines and tissues at the same level of statistical signifi-
cance (Tukey's HSD, or: 0.05). In contrast, we found statistically significant differences in the performance between extrapolation and interpolation to new chem—
icalclusters. The blue points indicate the median and the interquartile range (25th—75th percentile), whereas the red points indicate the mean RMSE value

grouped by the cell line, cell line—averaged (Supplementary Fig. S6a),
or compound cluster, compound cluster—averaged performance
(Supplementary Fig. 6b). Thus, one average RMSE,“t value across
the 10—fold models was calculated for each cell line and compound
cluster. If not otherwise indicated, the results presented in the fol—
lowing sections correspond to models trained on the uncorrelated
bioactivities 0.5 dataset with (i) compound fingerprints and (ii) the
‘G.t.l. 1000 genes’ dataset view as the input features. The cell line—
averaged RMSEmSt values ranged from 0.41 i 0.01 (U251) to
0.86 i 0.01 pGI50 units (HOP—92). We found significant differences
for the tissue—averaged performance (Tukey’s HSD, P < 1 X 10716),
with RMSEmSt values ranging from 0.48 i 0.01 (prostate, displayed
in cyan) to 0.70 i 0.01 (leukaemia, displayed in green) pGI50 units
(Supplementary Fig. 6a). In addition, the learning curves showed
that the RMSEmSt values of approximately twice the replicate—aver—
aged experimental uncertainty (0.27 pGI50 units) and the maximum
achievable performance (0.35 pGI50 units) can be obtained when
<10% of the data is used as a training set (Supplementary Fig. S7).
In contrast, an ANOVA analysis did not yield significant (P > 0.05)
differences among the 31 chemical clusters (Supplementary Fig.
S6b), with observed median RMSE,“t values in the 0.48—0.65 pGI50
units range. Hence, overall, it has been found that the interpolation
power is constant across the 31 chemical clusters, but not across
tissues.

3.8 Extrapolation in the cell line and tissue space

We further evaluated the extrapolation power to novel cell lines and
tissues with the LOCO and LOTO models using the complete
dataset. The LOCO models exhibited mean RMSEmSt values of
0.43 :0.08 pGI50 units (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table S12),
with the lowest and highest RMSEmSt values of 0.31 and 0.61
observed for cell lines U251 and OVCAR—5, respectively. Notably,
we found that the LOCO and cell line—averaged predictions are
highly correlated (rs:O.92), indicating that interpolation and ex—
trapolation to novel cell lines are correlated. The RMSEmSt values
for the LOTO models ranged between 0.35 (prostate) and 0.63
pGI50 units (leukaemia). Remarkably, the prediction errors were
similar across the entire bioactivity range (Supplementary Fig. S8).
Overall, we did not observe significant differences in performance
among the LOCO, LOTO (Fig. 3b), cell line—averaged
(Supplementary Fig. S6a), and compound cluster—averaged
(Supplementary Fig. S6b) results (Tukey’s HSD, P<0.05). We
found that the RMSE values between the observed and predicted
pGI50 values calculated using the LOCO and LOTO models for 47
out of 81 drugs, such as Imiquimod (NSC 369100) and
Bendamustine (NSC 138783), were below 0.5 pGI50 units
(Supplementary Fig. S9a and b). High RMSE values, between 1 and
1.5 pGI50 units, were observed for 11 drugs, such as the folate anti—
metabolite pemetrexed (NSC 698037) and Irinotecan (NSC
728073). Together, these data indicate that the PGM models ex—
trapolate compound bioactivities to novel cell lines and tissues at the
same level of statistical significance as for interpolation within a
given cell line or tissue.

3.9 Extrapolation in the chemical space

A markedly different trend was observed for the ability of the PGM
models to generalize across the chemical space, as assessed by the
LOCCO models using the complete dataset. The LOCCO models
exhibited mean RMSEmSt values of 0.83 i 0.17 pGI50 units (Fig. 3b
and Supplementary Table S12), which differed significantly from the
LOCO and LOTO results (Fig. 3b) (Tukey’s HSD, P< 0.01), and

from the compound cluster—averaged interpolation performance
(Supplementary Fig. S6b). Notably, the chemical diversity within
the compound clusters was not correlated with model performance,
as low RMSEmSt values were consistently obtained for the heteroge—
neous and homogeneous clusters (Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table
S13). The lowest RMSEmSt value of 0.53 pGI50 units was obtained
for cluster 24, which contains 485 compounds with polycyclic ring
systems, generally with no more than three fused rings, as well as
ring assemblies linked by sulphide, sulfinyl, secondary amine, car—
bonyl and alkyl groups (Supplementary Table S13). Cluster 16,
which was modelled with the highest RMSEmSt value of 1.23 pGI50
units, contains tri— and tetracyclic systems with hydroxybenzene,
methoxybenzene and quinone functionalities. We obtained errors in
prediction values below 0.5 pGI50 units for 15 out of 81 drugs in the
complete dataset, and below 1 pGI50 units for 43 compounds. The
worst predicted drugs were depsipeptide (NSC 630176) and the hal—
ichondrin B analogue NSC 707389, with respective errors in predic—
tion of 4.29 and 4.35 pGI50 units (Supplementary Fig. S9c). Taken
together, these results indicate that the range of errors is consider—
ably large (>4 pGI50 units), and, hence, extrapolations in the chem—
ical space remain a challenging task, and certainly on this particular
dataset.

3.10 Conformal prediction provides informative Cl
Conformal prediction was included in the modelling framework to
provide CI for the individual predictions. The percentage of data
points for which the predicted value lay within the calculated CI,
which were calculated with an increasing confidence level, is highly
correlated with the confidence level (Spearman’s rS > 0.99,
Supplementary Fig. S10). Therefore, the combination of the
Random Forest and conformal prediction estimates the compound
activity as a pGI50 region associated to a user—defined confidence
level, which represents an easily interpretable estimate of the reli—
ability of individual predictions.

3.11 Consistency of pathway—drug associations with
predicted bioactivities

To investigate whether the bioactivities predicted by the PGM mod—
els make it possible to identify genomic markers of drug sensitivity,
we evaluated the consistency between the pathway—drug associ—
ations inferred from the experimental and predicted bioactivities for
the 37 FDA—approved drugs and the 19 compounds in the clinical
trials (Supplementary Table S14) present in the uncorrelated bioac-
tivities 0.5 dataset. For each pathway, we fitted a linear model con—
trolled by the tissue source, where the average pathway expression
was considered as the predictor of drug sensitivity. Overall, no sig—
nificant differences (Tukey’s HSD, P < 0.05) were observed between
the pathway—drug associations calculated with the most predictive
10—fold CV PGM (Supplementary Fig. S11a) and LOCO models, as
the median Spearman’s rS values between the lip coefficients esti—
mated with (i) the experimental cell—line sensitivity data and (ii) the
CV and LOCO predictions were in the 0.75—0.91 range
(Supplementary Fig. S11b). These results indicate that the 10—fold
CV and LOCO predictions reﬂect the association between gene ex—
pression summarized at the pathway level and the cell line sensitiv—
ity. However, significant differences were found among these groups
and the LOCCO and LOTO models, for which the median
Spearman’s rS values were 0.63 and 0.03, respectively. We obtained
similar results when considering only the pathways significantly
associated to drug response [false discovery rate (FDR) < 20%]
(Supplementary Fig. S11c and d).

Improved large—scale prediction of growth inhibition patterns

Next, we analysed whether the pathway—drug associations are
consistently predicted for drugs exhibiting diverse MoAs. Out of the
56 drugs considered, 26 exhibited median Spearman’s rS values be—
tween the lip coefficients estimated with the experimental cell line
sensitivity data and the 10—fold CV predictions in the 0.5—0.75
range, and 18 were above 0.75 (Supplementary Fig. S10b). High
Spearman’s rS values were obtained across the 22 distinct drug
MoAs, indicating that no specific MoA is favoured. Notably, most
Spearman’s rS values increased (Supplementary Fig. S11d) when the
calculation of the pathway—drug associations was restricted to the
pathways significantly associated to drug response (FDR<20%).
Together, we can conclude that the identification of genomic
markers of drug sensitivity is significantly dependent on the presence
of cell lines originating from the same tissue and structurally similar
compounds in the training set.

3.12 Prediction of the growth inhibition patterns using
the NCI60 panel
The experimental and predicted growth inhibition patterns obtained
by the most predictive models were highly correlated
(Supplementary Fig. S11e), with median Spearman’s rS values in the
0.53—0.5 8 range, and 32 out of the 56 drugs from the uncorrelated
bioactivities 0.5 dataset had values higher than 0.5 for
(Supplementary Fig. S11f). Nevertheless, the LOCO, LOTO and
LOCCO models (Tukey’s HSD, P value < 0.001) displayed a
marked decrease in the rS values (Supplementary Fig. S11e) with re—
spect to the most predictive 10—fold CV PGM models.

The relative growth inhibition values using the NCI60 panel can
be depicted in a bar plot with the pGI50 values transformed into z—
scores. Figure 4 depicts the observed and predicted growth inhib—
ition patterns for methotrexate (MTX) via the 10—fold CV PGM
model. MTX was chosen for illustration, given its complex growth
inhibition pattern. (Bar plots for the 56 drugs calculated with the
predictions obtained with the 10—fold CV PGM, LOCO, LOTO and
LOCCO models are provided in the Supplementary material.) The
predictions accounted for 55 out of 59 cases for the relative sensitiv—
ity of the cell line. For instance, the six leukaemia cell lines (green
turquoise) were predicted to be sensitive to MTX. Moreover, com—
plex inhibition patterns for renal—derived cell lines (light magenta)
were accounted for by the predictions, as the TK—10, RXF—393 and
A498 cell lines were predicted to be highly resistant to MTX,
whereas the effect of MTX on sensitive cell lines, namely UO—31,
SN12C, CAKI—1 and ACHN, was also correctly predicted (Fig. 4b).
Taken together, these data indicate that the drug sensitivity predic—
tions were able to account for the complex patterns of cell line
growth inhibition for this particular drug.

3.13 Comparisons to previous methods

We compared our results with previous studies (Ammad—ud—din
et al., 2014; Menden et al., 2013) by applying our modelling proced—
ure to the GDSC and CCLE datasets using the Morgan fingerprints
as the compound descriptors, and the gene transcript levels for the
1000 genes displaying the highest variance across the cell line panel
to describe the cell lines (Supplementary Text and Table S15). For
the GDSC dataset, we obtained lower mean RMSEmSt and higher
Rzmt values, namely 0.75 i 0.01 and 0.74 i 0.01 pGI50 units, re—

Fig. 4. Evaluation of the predicted growth inhibition patterns for MTX on the
NCI60 panel. (a) The relative growth inhibition pattern (z—scores) on the NCI60
panel was calculated from the experimental pGlEo values together with the
experimental uncertainty of the measurements. (b) Predicted relative growth
inhibition pattern of growth inhibition in the 10-fold CV model (i.e. interpol-
ation) along with the 75% Cl calculated using conformal prediction. Complex,
and overall matching, inhibition patterns are reflected by the predictions. For
instance, the TK-10, RXF-393 and A498 renal cell lines (marked with an aster-
isk) were predicted to be highly resistant to MTX, whereas the effect of MTX
on sensitive cell lines, namely UO-31, SN12C, CAKl-1 and ACHN, was also
correctly predicted. Cell lines originating from the same tissue are in the
same colour (breast: red, central nervous system: orange, colon: olive green,
lung cancer: dark green, leukaemia: turquoise, melanoma: blue, ovarian:
blue, prostate: purple, renal: magenta)

extrapolating to new compounds. However, it is important to men—
tion that Ammad—ud—din et al. (2014) grouped compounds into sets
at random and not based on chemical similarity, which likely made
their extrapolation easier.

4 Discussion

The primary goal of this study was to capitalize on the increasing
amount of in vitro cell line sensitivity and molecular profiling data of
cancer cells to predict the growth inhibition patterns of compounds
on the NCI60 panel. Although the principles of pharmacogenomic

modelling are not new, this study represents novelty in the field, as, to
our knowledge, it is the first effort to combine large—scale NCI anti—
cancer screening data using the NCI60 panel with the available cell
line profiling information, including error bars. Unlike previous mod—
elling studies on the NCI60 panel (Abaan et al., 2013; Paull et al.,
1989; Staunton et al., 2001; Szakacs et al., 2004; Wan and Pal, 2014),
we simultaneously integrated the chemical information and cell line
profiling data, which enables us to predict the growth inhibition pat—
terns and to inter— and extrapolate on the chemical and cell line do—
mains. In addition, coupling conformal prediction to the Random
Forest enabled the definition of CI for the individual predictions.

We consistently found the highest predictive signals in the gene ex—
pression, miRNA and protein abundance data. The incorporation of
prior biological knowledge by summarizing the gene expression data
at the pathway level did not provide an additional predictive signal.
Interestingly, high predictive power was attained with models trained
on gene expression data from the genes displaying the most variable
transcript levels across the cell line panel. Encoding cell lines with cell
line kernels led, in some cases, to models with comparable predictive
power to those trained explicitly on the cell line profiling data.
Although encoding cell lines with cell line kernels may be sufficient to
model the compound pGI50 values from the NCI6 0 panel, in our view
this would not be the case on datasets comprising highly dissimilar
cell lines. In addition, we note, in particular, that the Dirac and MLT
kernels do not permit us to extrapolate in the cell line space, likely
rendering them less useful in those cases. The sparseness of the CNV
and exome sequencing data may be the reason for the poor model per—
formance, and, therefore, it remains to be seen whether the modelling
of cell line panels with more comprehensive mutational data leads to
better predictions (Costello et al., 2014).

A major challenge to the cell line sensitivity prediction is the ex—
trapolation of compound bioactivities to novel cell lines and to
structurally distinct compounds. We did not find significant differ—
ences in performance between the interpolation and the extrapola—
tion to new cell lines (LOCO) and tissues (LOTO), with mean
RMSE,“t values in all cases smaller than twice the mean uncer—
tainty value of the bioactivity measurements. This observation en—
ables the prediction of compound activities on cancer cell lines for
which little bioactivity data are currently available; however, ex—
trapolation is still improved by the presence of cell lines from the
same tissue/ontogeny in the training set. Given that similar com—
pounds exhibit similar growth inhibition profiles (Shivakumar and
Krauthammer, 2009), it was expected that the model performance
would considerably decrease when predicting the activity of struc—
turally dissimilar compounds. This was indeed the case because
mean RMSEmSt values of approximately three times the average ex—
perimental uncertainty were obtained when extrapolating in the
chemical space (LOCCO). Although the error in prediction should
ideally be close to the experimental uncertainty, this performance
may still be useful for compound prioritization. Previous studies
have shown that adding physicochemical descriptors or increasing
the bit—string length of the Morgan fingerprints (set to 256 here)
leads to higher predictive power when modelling a highly diverse set
of molecules (De Bruyn et al., 2013). Here, we did not obtain higher
predictive power when increasing the bit—string length, when adding
physicochemical descriptors to the compound fingerprints, or when
using Morgan fingerprints in binary format (Cortes—Ciriano et al.,
2014). Our approach displays a higher predictive ability (10% de—
crease of CV RMSE) than the methods previously applied to the
GDSC dataset (Supplementary Text and Supplementary Table S15).

Moreover, the application of our approach to the Cancer Cell
line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (Barretina et al., 2012) dataset led to

statistically validated models, displaying R20 test values of~0.74,
which were comparable to those obtained on the GDSC and NCI60
datasets. Given that gene expression profiles for the 44 cell lines
comprised in the CCLE and the NCI60 panel are highly correlated
(Spearman’s r520.88) (Supplementary Fig. S12), we suggest that
PGM models trained on the NCI60 panel could be applied to the
CCLE cell line panel, which could identify new purposes for the
17 142 compounds considered here (Weinstein, 2012).

It is also important to consider how the cell line sensitivity is
quantified for the application of the type of model presented here.
Fallahi—Sichani et al. (2013) applied a multi—parametric analysis to a
dataset comprising the activity of 64 anticancer drugs on 53 breast
cancer cell lines. The results of this study indicate that the param—
eters of the dose—response curve vary systematically and depend on
both the cell line as well as the drug class. For instance, the MoA of
a drug has a strong inﬂuence on drug efficacy (Emax), potency (IC50)
and on the steepness of the drug response curve. Overall, this study
indicates that parameters other than the potency of the drug re—
sponse curve should be considered in studies comparing drug activ—
ity, as they are likely to provide crucial insights into the biology of
the cell line’s response to drug treatment and into the drugs’ MoA.

An additional key aspect is the consistency of the in vitro cell
line sensitivity data. A previous study (Haibe—Kains et al., 2013) re—
ported a rather low correlation of the cell line sensitivity data from
the CCLE and GDSC datasets. We found low concordance between
the NCI60 and the CCLE sensitivity data (Supplementary Fig. S13),
and we did not obtain a high correlation between the predictions
calculated with a model trained on the NCI60 data for eight drugs
on 44 cell lines shared by the CCLE and the subset of the NCI6 0 cell
lines considered here. Actually, the RMSE values for these predic—
tions against the experimental data from the CCLE and, the pIC50
values from the CCLE and the pGI50 from the NCI60 dataset for
these eight drugs and 44 cell—lines was comparable, namely 0.87
log10 units, indicating that high predictive power cannot be attained
given the low concordance of the sensitivity data from these two
datasets. These results come as no surprise, given the different surro—
gates of cytotoxicity exploited by the assays used to screen the
CCLE and NCI60 panels, namely metabolic activity and protein
abundance, respectively. Therefore, we conclude, in accord with
Haibe—Kains et al. (2013), that models trained on the NCI60 data
set are likely to fail on sensitivity data measured with a different ex—
perimental procedure, e.g. the CCLE or GDSC datasets.

Finally, although cultured cell lines and primary tumours differ
genetically (Borrell, 2010) and 2D cell lines cultures do not recapitu—
late the complex tumour microenvironment, investigating the extent
to which gene expression (and other cell line profiling) data can be
used to model in vitro cell line sensitivity can help researchers to de—
velop approaches for the prediction of clinical drug responses using
the genomic data of tumour samples (Geeleher et al., 2014).

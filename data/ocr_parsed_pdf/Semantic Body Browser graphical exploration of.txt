Abstract

Summary: Advancing technologies generate large amounts of molecular and phenotypic data on
cells, tissues and organisms, leading to an ever—growing detail and complexity while information
retrieval and analysis becomes increasingly time—consuming. The Semantic Body Browser is a
web application for intuitively exploring the body of an organism from the organ to the subcellular
level and visualising expression profiles by means of semantically annotated anatomical illustra—
tions. It is used to comprehend biological and medical data related to the different body structures
while relying on the strong pattern recognition capabilities of human users.

Availability and implementation: The Semantic Body Browser is a JavaScript web application that
is freely available at http://sbb.cellfinder.org. The source code is provided on https://github.com/

1 Introduction

Technological innovations of the last decades have revolutionized
current bio—medical research. High—throughput sequence data is
widely adopted and repositories like Gene Expression Omnibus
(Barrett et (11., 2013) or ArrayExpress (Rustici et (11., 2013) provide
access to large amounts of expression data. Imaging and functional
analysis tools improve phenotypic cell and tissue characterization,
while text mining facilitates big—data applications with increasing
importance in current research. Thus, scientists and clinicians are
faced with an ever—growing detail and complexity, resulting in an
increasing amount of time and resources that are needed to retrieve
and process the right information, which constitutes one of the
major obstacles for their efficient use.

Most data resources provide text—based information retrieval
only, meaning that the user searches for keywords of a desired tar—
get. While this is sufficient when the target is known by name, it
often fails or is time—consuming when the exact target name is un—
known. Similarly, large tables of numbers are suitable for computa—
tional analysis, but require expert knowledge and time to be
analysed manually. While graphs or diagrams can greatly summa—
rize numbers, concepts or other data, their representation remains
abstract and does not close the gap between complexity of data and
intuitiveness of access. In biomedical research reality, it is highly
desirable to have quick and intuitive access to a broad range of
information and data types, which cannot easily comprehend by
conventional means.

Semantic Body Browser

The Semantic Body Browser (SBB) exploits the visual pattern rec—
ognition capability of human users to provide this access. The SBB
uses the anatomy of an organism’s body itself as starting point to
browse for information associated with organs, tissues, cells or cel—
lular structures. Besides very fundamental computer skills no pre—
knowledge is required, to use the SBB. The representation of data is
facilitated by means of interactive, annotated anatomical illustra—
tions through a user—friendly web application for fast access to up—
to—date computationally derived data. An organism is explored
along the four dimensions: resolution/location (gross body to subcel—
lular level), developmental stage (e.g. Carnegie stages), species
(e.g. human and mouse) and gender (male and female).

2 Description and results

Little to no computational or terminological background knowledge
is required to operate the SBB. Retrieving information is facilitated
by a mouse click within the region of interest, e.g. an organ, anatom—
ical structure or cell (Fig. 1A, B). Information annotated to the se—
lected entity is then displayed together with further browsing
options and links to their related CellFinder (Stachelscheid et (11.,
2014) entry for further in—depth information. Moreover, a text—
based search for biological entities is available.

Each biological entity can feature a definition, synonyms and
microscopic images as points of reference. To visualize expression
profiles associated with an entity, a list of genes can be defined
manually using a text—based search for gene symbols. The interactive
expression heat maps are displayed within the illustrations to visual—
ize spatial gene expression patterns of different biological entities
(Fig. 1C). The generated heat maps and illustrations can be exported
as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) in modern browsers.

Illustrations were produced by professional biomedical illustra—
tors and validated by experts in anatomy, pathology and cytology.
The four dimensions of exploration (resolution, developmental
stage, species and gender) are each visualized through different sets
of illustrations. All biological entities (e.g. organs, anatomical struc—
tures, cells or subcellular components) are annotated using uniform
resource identifiers (URI) provided by the Cell: Expression,
Localization, Development, Anatomy (CELDA) ontology (Seltmann
et (11., 2013). Currently 22 illustrations for human and 21 for mouse,
featuring three organs (kidney, liver and gall bladder) are imple—
mented, providing 12 levels of resolution (Fig. 1B), 6 developmental
stages, 2 species as well as separated views of the male and female
human body. The illustrations currently comprise 674 (333 unique)
biological entities, validated by experts in liver and kidney biology.
In addition to anatomical illustrations, the SBB features high quality
microscopic pictures, linked from CellFinder.

3 Implementation

The SBB is implemented as a JavaScript web application using the
open source framework Angulaer created by Google as the applica—
tion’s backbone. A RESTful API, based on the PHP Slim framework,
provides access to the data, which is stored using a MySQL server.
Illustrations are displayed as SVG to provide dynamic inter—
actions as well as semantic annotations. Annotations follow the
Resource Description Framework in Attributes (RDFa) 1.1 standard
as recommended by the W3C (http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa—cord).
Hereby, each illustration is annotated using the about attribute. The
containing biological entities are semantically integrated using the
‘property’ and ‘resource’ attributes. We use the ‘has_part’ relation of

Fig. 1. (A) The human male body gross view is annotated as a whole (1) by a
URI using the RDFa about attribute within the SVG tag. Specific anatomical
entities within the illustration, like the liver (2), are precisely selectable, edit-
able and semantically annotated. Thus, the application is aware of the entities
contained within an illustration and knows their meaning. (B) Stepwise
increased resolution of the yellow areas from the liver gross view down to
the subcellular view of the hepatocyte. (C) Heat map of spatially resolved ex-
pression profiles is displayed by translating the relative accumulated expres-
sion value of a gene selection into a colour ranging from bright yellow
(maximal expression value of gene selection) over red to dark blue (minimal
expression value of gene selection)

the relations ontology (Smith et (11., 2005) as the describing property
(Fig. 1A).

The heat map visualization of spatial gene expression profiles
currently uses the RNA Seq Atlas (Krupp et (11., 2012) and Human
BodyMap 2.0, Ensembl release 74 (Flicek et (11., 2014) datasets, fea—
turing 11, respectively, 16 healthy human tissues. As shown by Li
et al. (2010) and Wagner et al. (2012) reads per kilo base per million
(RPKM) values may be biased in cross—sample comparisons, which
is why we provide transcripts per million. Our protocol for assessing
count—based expression data is mainly guided by Anders et al.
(2013) using TopHat (Trapnell et (11., 2009), B0wtie2 (Langmead
and Salzberg, 2012), Samtools (Li et (11., 2009) and HTSeq (Anders
et (11., 2015).

The SBB has been tested extensively by computer scientists, bio—
logical and medical researchers over more than 1 year to ensure
quality and compatibility with all modern browsers (Google
Chrome 2 19, Firefox 2 4, Safari 2 4.0.5, Opera 2 12.15, Internet
Explorer2 9). It is integrated into CellFinder (http://cellfinder.0rg/
browse) and also available as a stand—alone web application (http://
sbb.cellfinder.0rg). The web application is licensed under GNU GPL
3.0. Unless otherwise stated content is licensed under Creative

4 Discussion

To our knowledge, the SBB is the first web—based tool for browsing
and searching large sets of diverse biological information guided by
interactive anatomical illustrations that integrate different levels of reso—
lution, developmental stages, gender and species. The two—dimensional
(2D) representation of an organism’s anatomy using vector graphics fa—
cilitates high accuracy, dynamic interactions and element—wise onto—
logical annotations while maintaining simplicity and usability across a
wide range of devices. Existing 3D representations like B0dyParts3D
(Mitsuhashi et (11., 2009), Zygote Body (http://zygotebody.c0m) or the
Worm Browser (http://br0wser.0penw0rm.0rg/), conversely, emphasize
on graphical representation of the organism’s gross anatomy rather
than on exploration across many different dimensions.

The intuitive means of finding and displaying spatially resolved
gene expression data makes the SBB especially useful for scientists and
physicians with less computational background as a quick access point
to biological data. The SBB could potentially be adopted in various
data repositories or medical applications that benefit from an inter—
active visual representation along an organisms anatomy. While visual—
ising ontologies in their full spectra, especially in an automated fashion,
remains challenging (Carpendale et al., 2014), the SBB is primarily a
hand—curated extension to current biomedical—related information re—
trieval systems using the natural connection between anatomy ontolo—
gies and anatomical illustrations. Conceptually, it is an ontologically
annotated anatomy visualization.

5 Conclusion

To summarize, the SBB is an intuitive, user—friendly web application
for graphically browsing an organism’s body for cell and tissue asso—
ciated data. It is meant to enhance the information retrieval and
visualization of biological data without requiring computational
background knowledge.

NetWeAvers

 

statistical signiﬁcance for each protein. The resulting P—values for
individual proteins can be used in the network analysis step,
which scores highly connected subgraphs, i.e. dense clusters,
with these P—values. Because the need to specify many param—
eters can greatly impact the results, we chose a highly data—driven
cluster—finding algorithm that requires only one parameter. Our
protein and cluster scoring each require only one additional
parameter.

2 DESCRIPTION

NetWeAvers provides a method for the integrated statistical ana—
lysis of MS data and biological networks. The input for
NetWeAvers is a set of peaks from an MS experiment that has
been identified, quantiﬁed and normalized. The data can be
input as an R/Bioconductor ExpressionSet or a matrix to be
converted into an ExpressionSet using customSummarizer.
If the data are at the peptide level, then summarization to
the protein level is required for use in NetWeAvers
(esetSummarizer). This can be done before or after testing
for DE (DEtest). The summarization step consists of aggregat—
ing all peptide quantities for a given protein using the mean or
median so that each protein only has one value per sample.

The test for DE is implemented using the linear modeling
framework of the limma package (Smyth, 2004). The output
of the test includes P—values that may be used in the main
algorithm of NetWeAvers (runNetweavers), which maps
the proteins to a user—specifred network in nodeinode format
and performs the network analysis. The function
f indDens eClus ters uses the Walktrap algorithm for finding
highly connected subgraphs as implemented in the R package
igraph (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006) as a part of the network
analysis algorithm.

The clusters are scored using a weighted mean or median of
log—transformed P—values (scoreClusters). The weights are a
function of the number of proteins with which a given protein
interacts. A permutation test (permTes t) may be carried out to
determine the statistical significance of the clusters. See
Supplementary File 1 for more details on the cluster scoring
and the permutation test, as well as Supplementary Figure S1
for a schematic overview of the NetWeAvers procedure.

3 APPLICATION

We applied the R package to MS data from a phosphorylation
study of human embryonic stem cells (Van Hoof et al., 2009, see
Supplementary File S1 for the experimental design). The R pack—
age vignette provided as Supplementary File S2 presents the code
for summarizing the data, performing hypothesis testing and
running the network analysis using the Reactome human
PPIN, version 43 (Croft et al., 2011). NetWeAvers identifred
clusters of proteins with roles in processes known to be involved
in stem cell differentiation. See Supplementary File 1 for these
results, results from NetWeAvers applied to a null dataset and an

example using data that were summarized and tested in another
R package.

4 CONCLUSIONS

NetWeAvers is a unique algorithm designed for quantitative MS
data that incorporates key features of the proteins and networks
(P—values and number of interactors, respectively) being ana—
lyzed. It uses only a few parameters and does not arbitrarily
filter out non—signifrcant proteins. We applied our method to a
publicly available MS dataset and found statistically signiﬁcant
and biologically meaningful networks. The method may also be
used with gene expression data. Many databases provide PPINs
in nodeinode format, which makes it easy for users to connect
NetWeAvers with their favorite databases. The format of the
NetWeAvers output allows for simple connections to tools like
Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) to visualize the resulting
clusters.

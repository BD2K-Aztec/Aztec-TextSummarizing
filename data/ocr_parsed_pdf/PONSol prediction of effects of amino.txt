Abstract

Motivation: Solubility is one ofthe fundamental protein properties. It is of great interest because of
its relevance to protein expression. Reduced solubility and protein aggregation are also associated
with many diseases.

Results: We collected from literature the largest experimentally verified solubility affecting amino
acid substitution (AAS) dataset and used it to train a predictor called PON—Sol. The predictor can dis—
tinguish both solubility decreasing and increasing variants from those not affecting solubility. PON—
Sol has normalized correct prediction ratio of 0.491 on cross—validation and 0.432 for independent
test set. The performance ofthe method was compared both to solubility and aggregation predictors
and found to be superior. PON—Sol can be used for the prediction of effects of disease—related substi—
tutions, effects on heterologous recombinant protein expression and enhanced crystallizability. One
application is to investigate effects of all possible AASs in a protein to aid protein engineering.
Availability and implementation: PON—Sol is freely available at http://structure.bmc.lu.se/PON—Sol.

1 Introduction

Numerous experimental methods are used to investigate variations af-
fecting protein function, structure and properties. In addition, compu-
tational approaches are increasingly utilized for predicting effects and
mechanisms of variations. Solubility has been of great interest because
of its relevance to protein (over)expression. Reduced solubility and
protein aggregation are associated with many human diseases.
Solubility is very important also for protein structural studies.
Solubility and aggregation are related but different physical con-
cepts. Solubility means concentration in saturated solution where
the soluble protein is in equilibrium with solid phase (Arakawa and
Timasheff, 1985). Protein in solid phase may be made soluble by di-
lution. In case of aggregation, protein is in solid phase but this pro-
cess is typically accompanied by changes to protein structure,

integrity and/or modification (Arakawa and Timasheff, 1985).
Aggregation is an irreversible process occurring for example in
Alzheimer’s disease and systemic amyloidoses.

During the last decade computational methods have been de-
veloped to predict protein solubility especially for heterologous pro-
tein overexpression. These methods utilize different approaches,
typically in the field of machine learning.

Much less effort has been put on predicting the effects of vari-
ations to protein solubility. It is well known that amino acid substi-
tutions (AASs) can have profound effects on solubility and lead to
diseases including severe complex V deficiency (Meulemans et (11.,
2010) and cataract (Andley and Reilly, 2010). Until now two tools
have been released for such predictions OptSolMut (Tian et (11.,
2010) and CamSol (Sormanni et (11., 2014).

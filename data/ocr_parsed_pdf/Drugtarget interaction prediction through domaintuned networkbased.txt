ABSTRACT

Motivation: The identification of drug—target interaction (DTI) repre-
sents a costly and time-consuming step in drug discovery and design.
Computational methods capable of predicting reliable DTI play an im-
portant role in the field. Recently, recommendation methods relying on
network-based inference (NBI) have been proposed. However, such
approaches implement naive topology-based inference and do not
take into account important features within the drug—target domain.
Results: In this article, we present a new NBI method, called domain
tuned-hybrid (DT-Hybrid), which extends a well-established recom-
mendation technique by domain-based knowledge including drug
and target similarity. DT-Hybrid has been extensively tested using
the last version of an experimentally validated DTI database obtained
from DrugBank. Comparison with other recently proposed NBI meth-
ods clearly shows that DT-Hybrid is capable of predicting more
reliable DTIs.

Availability: DT-Hybrid has been developed in R and it is available,
along with all the results on the predictions, through an R package at

1 INTRODUCTION

Detecting and verifying new connections among drugs and tar-
gets is a costly process. From a historical point of View, the
pharmaceutical chemist’s approach has been commonly focused
on the development of compounds acting against particular
families of ‘druggable’ proteins Wildirim et al., 2007). Drugs
act by binding to specific proteins, hence changing their bio-
chemical and/or biophysical activities, with many consequences
on various functions. Furthermore, because proteins operate as
part of highly interconnected cellular networks (i.e. the interac-
tome networks), the ‘one gene, one drug, one disease’ paradigm
has been challenged in many cases (Hopkins, 2008). For this
reason, the concept of polypharmacology has been raised for
those drugs acting on multiple targets rather than a single one
(Hopkins, 2008). These polypharmacological features of drugs
bring a wealth of knowledge and enable us to understand drug

side effects or ﬁnd their new uses, namely, drug repositioning
(Ashburn and Thor, 2004; Boguski et al., 2009).

Nevertheless, many interactions are still unknown, and given
the signiﬁcant amount of resources needed for in situ experimen-
tation, it is necessary to develop algorithmic methodologies
allowing the prediction of new and signiﬁcant relationships
among elements interacting at the process level.

In the literature, several computational tools have been pro-
posed to afford the problem of DTI prediction and drug
repositioning.

Traditional methods rely either on ligand-based or receptor-
based approaches. Among ligand-based methods, we can cite
quantitative structure-activity relationships, and a similarity
search-based approach (Gonzalez-Daz et al., 2011; Keiser
et al., 2007). On the other hand, receptor-based methods, such
as reverse docking, have also been applied in drugitarget (DT)
binding afﬁnity prediction, DTI prediction and drug reposition-
ing (Ashburn and Thor, 2004; Li et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2011).
However, the latter have the shortcoming that cannot be used for
targets whose 3D structures are unknown.

Recently, much attention has been devoted to network-based
and phenotype-based approaches. Most of these methods rely on
the successful idea of using bipartite graphs.

In Yildirim et a]. (2007), a bipartite graph linking US Food
and Drug Administration-approved drugs to proteins by DT
binary associations is exploited. Campillos et a]. (2008) identiﬁed
new DTIs using side effect similarity.

Iorio et a]. (2010) make use of transcriptional responses, pre-
dicted and validated new drug modes of action and drug repos-
itioning. Recently, Dudley et a]. (2011) and Sirota et a]. (2011)
have presented drug repositioning methods exploiting public
gene expression data. Furthermore, Yamanishi et a]. (2008) de-
veloped a bipartite graph learning method to predict DTI by
integrating chemical and genomic data.

Cheng et a]. (2012) present a technique based on network-based
inference (NBI) implementing a naive version of the algorithm
proposed by Zhou et a]. (2007). All these results clearly show
the good performance of this approach. On the other hand, know-
ledge about drug and protein domain is not properly exploited.

van Laarhoven et a]. (2011) use a machine learning method
starting from a DTI network to predict new ones with high ac-
curacy. The calculation of the new interactions is done through
the regularized least squares algorithm. The regularized least
squares algorithm is trained using a kernel (GIP%}aussian
interaction profile) that summarizes the information in the net-
work. The authors developed variants of the original kernel by

Drug-target interaction prediction

 

taking into account chemical and genomic information. This im-
proved the accuracy, in particular for small datasets.

Chen et a]. (2012) introduced their Network-based Random
Walk with Restart on the Heterogeneous network (NRWRH)
algorithm predicting new interactions between drugs and targets
by means of a model based on a random walk with a restart in a
‘heterogeneous’ network. The model is constructed by extending
the network of DTI interactions with drugwlrug and proteinipro-
tein similarity networks. This methodology shows excellent per-
formance in predicting new interactions. However, its
disadvantage is due to its random nature, mainly caused by the
initial probabilities selection.

Mei et a]. (2013) proposed the Bipartite Local Model-
Interaction-profile Inferring (BLM-NII) algorithm. Interactions
between drugs and targets are deduced by training a classiﬁer
(i.e. support vector machine or regularized least square). This is
achieved by exploiting interaction information, drug and target
similarities. This classiﬁer is appropriately extended to include
knowledge on new drug/target candidates. This is used to predict
the new target probability of a speciﬁc drug. The algorithm is
highly reliable in predicting interactions between new drug/target
candidates. On the other hand, its capability of training several
distinct classiﬁers to obtain the final model is not strong enough.

In this present article, we propose a novel method called do-
main tuned-hybrid (DT-Hybrid). It extends the NBI algorithm
proposed in Zhou et a]. (2007) and applied in Cheng et a].
(2012) by adding application domain knowledge. Similarity
among drugs and targets is plugged into the model. Despite its
simplicity, the technique provides a complete and functional
framework for in silico prediction of drug and target relationships.
To demonstrate the reliability of the method, we conducted a wide
experimental analysis using four benchmark datasets drawn from
DrugBank. We compared our method with the one proposed by
Chen et al., 2012. The experiments clearly show that DT-Hybrid
overcomes the problems shown by the naive NBI algorithm, and it
is capable of producing higher quality predictions.

2 METHODS
2.1 Algorithm

The method we propose is based on the recommendation technique pre-
sented by Zhou et a]. (2007) and extended by Zhou et a]. (2010). Let
X: {x1,x2, ...,xm} be a set of small molecules (i.e. biological com-
pounds, molecules), and T: {t1,t2, ...,t,,} a set of targets (i.e. genes,
proteins); the X-T network of interactions can be described as a bipartite
graph G(X, T, E) where E = {a}: x,- e X, tj e T}. A link between x,- and t,
is drawn in the graph when the structure x,- is associated with the target t,.
The network can be represented by an adjacency matrix A 2 {off}
where aﬂ- = 1 if x,- is connected to tj; otherwise, aﬂ- = 0.

Zhou et a]. (2010) proposed a recommendation method based on the
bipartite network projection technique implementing the concept of re-
sources transfer within the network. Given the bipartite graph deﬁned
above, a two-phase resource transfer is associated with one of its projec-
tions: at the beginning, the resource is transferred from nodes belonging
to T to those in X, and subsequently the resource is transferred back to
the T nodes. This process allows us to deﬁne a technique for the calcu-
lation of the weight matrix (W = {wij} ) in the projection as follows:

where 1" determines how the distribution of resources takes place in the
second phase, and k(x) is the degree of the x node in the bipartite network.
By varying the 1" function, we obtain the following algorithms (Table 1):

o NBI, introduced by Zhou et a]. (2007) and used by Cheng et a].
(2012) for the prediction of the interactions between drugs and
proteins;

a HeatS, introduced by Zhou et a]. (2010);

a Hybrid N+H, introduced by Zhou et a]. (2010), in which the func-
tions deﬁned in NBI and HeatS are combined in connection with a
parameter called A;

o DT-Hybrid, introduced here, is an enhanced version of the Hybrid
algorithm in which previous domain-dependent biological know-
ledge is plugged into the model through a similarity matrix.

Given the weight matrix W and the adjacency matrix A of the bipartite
network, it is possible to compute the recommendation matrix
R = {riJ-lem by the product:

R=W>A. (2)

For each x,- in X, its recommendation list is given by the set
R,- = {(tj,rj,-) | aﬂ- = 0}, where r],- is the ‘score’ of recommending t, to xi.

This list is then sorted in a descending order with respect to the score
because the higher elements are expected to have a better interaction with
the corresponding structure.

Notice that the method described above does not make use of any
previous biological knowledge of the application domain. Here we pro-
pose the DT-Hybrid algorithm, which extends the recommendation
model by introducing: (i) similarity between small molecules (i.e. molecu-
lar compounds), and (ii) sequence similarity between targets.

Let S = {my-LIX" be the target similarity matrix [i.e. either BLAST bits
scores (Altschul et al., 1990) or Smith-Waterman local alignment scores
(Smith and Waterman, 1981)]. This information can be taken into ac-
count by using equation (1) with 1"(i,j) deﬁned as in row 4 of Table 1.
Including structural similarity requires more effort. Therefore, it is neces-
sary to manipulate such information to obtain a variant of the S matrix,
and simplify the computation of the equation (1).

Let S1 =  be the structure similarity matrix [i.e. SIMCOMP
similarity score (Hattori et al., 2003) in the case of compounds]. It is
possible to obtain a matrix S2 = {sﬁ—J’an (where each element  describes
similarity between t,- and 1, based on the common interactions in the
network weighted by compound similarity) by putting:

 = 22121  (ailafkslk) -
21:21 21:1 (ailajk)

This matrix can be linearly combined with the target similarity matrix S,

This additional biological knowledge yields faster computation and

connection with equations (1) and (2) allows the prediction of recommen-
dation lists.

2.2 Datasets and benchmarks

We evaluated our method using four datasets (Cheng et al., 2012) con-
taining experimentally veriﬁed interactions between drugs and genes. We
analyzed the performances of NBI [equation (1) using 1"(i,j) in Table 1,
row 1], Hybrid [equation (1) using 1"(in) in Table 1, row 3] and DT-
Hybrid [equation (1) using 1"(i,j) in Table 1, row 4].

The datasets were built by grouping all possible interactions between
genes and drugs (DTI) based on their main gene types: enzymes, ion
channels, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and nuclear receptors
(Table 2). The following similarity measures have been used: (i)
SIMCOMP 2D chemical similarity of drugs (Hattori et al., 2003), and
(ii) Smith-Waterman sequence similarity of genes (Smith and Waterman,
1981).

Similarities have been normalized according to Yamanishi et al. (2008):

. . 80.1)
S l, = —. S
norm(  m ( )

Results are evaluated by combining the methods presented by Zhou
et al. (2010) and Cheng et al. (2012). More precisely, we applied a 10-fold
cross-validation and repeated the experiments 30 times.

Notice that, the random partition used in the cross-validation could
cause isolation of nodes in the network on which the test is performed.
Because all the tested algorithms are capable of predicting new inter-
actions only for drugs and targets for which we already have some infor-
mation, we computed the partition so that for each node, at least one link
to the other nodes remains in the test set.

According to Zhou et al. (2010), the following four metrics were con-
sidered: precision and recall enhancement, recovery, personalization and
surprisal.

Precision and Recall Enhancement, ep(L) and eR(L). Quality is mea-
sured in terms of the top L elements in the recommendation list of each
biological structure. Let D,- be the number of deleted interactions re-
covered for drug i, and let D,—(L) be its position in the top L places of
is recommendation list. The average precision and recall for the predic-
tion process can be computed as follows:

 

 

1 "1 D,-(L)

1%):ng L . (6)
1 ml ,-

R(L) = g X) DE). 01

1'21

where m’ is the number of structures with at least one deleted link. A
better perspective can be obtained by considering these values within
random models P,,,,,d(L) and R,,,,,d(L).

Table 2. Description of the dataset: number of biological structures, tar-
gets and interactions together with a measure of sparsity

 

 

Dataset Structures Targets Interactions Sparsity
Enzymes 445 664 2926 0.0099
Ion channels 210 204 1476 0.0344
GPCRs 223 95 635 0.0299
Nuclear receptors 54 26 90 0.0641
Complete DrugBank 4398 3784 12 446 0.0007

 

Note: The sparsity is obtained as the ratio between the number of known inter—
actions and the number of all possible interactions.

If the structure i has a total of D,- deleted interactions, then
Piand(L) = D,-/(n — k(i)) % D,-/n [given that n >> k(i)]. Consequently,
averaging for all structures we obtain P,,,,,d(L) = D/n >m, where D is
the number of links in the test set. On the other hand, the average
number of links deleted in the ﬁrst L positions is given by
LD,-/(n —k(i)) % LD,-/n. Again by averaging for all structures,
R,,,,,d(L) = L/n. Given these random models, it is possible to compute
the precision and recall enhancement as follows:

 

 

ML) = :22) = P(L) ‘ " 5’", (8)

Finally, as opposed to the recommendation on social systems, the three
other metricsirecovery, personalization and surprisaliare not so sig-
nificant in drugitarget systems. For this reason, we report the details of
such metrics (their deﬁnitions together with the experimental results), just
for completeness, in the Supplementary Materials.

3 RESULTS

In this article, we propose a method called DT-Hybrid, which
extends NBI (Cheng et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2007) and the
Hybrid (Zhou et al., 2010) algorithms by integrating previous
domain-dependent knowledge. Experiments show that this ex-
tension improves both algorithms in terms of prediction of new
biologically significant interactions. In the supporting materials,
we report a comprehensive analysis of DT-Hybrid and Hybrid,
together with their behavior varying the a (only for DT-Hybrid)
and A parameters. Table 3 illustrates the result of comparing
NBI, Hybrid and DT-Hybrid in terms of precision and recall
enhancement. DT-Hybrid clearly outperforms both NBI and
Hybrid in recovering deleted links. It is important to point out
that hybrid algorithms are able to significantly improve recall
(eR) measuring the prediction ability of recovering existing inter-
actions in a complex network. Figure 1 illustrates the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves calculated over the com-
plete DrugBank dataset. Simulations were executed 30 times, and
the results were averaged to obtain a performance evaluation.
Experiments show that all three techniques have a high true-
positive rate against a low false-positive rate. However, hybrid
algorithms provided better performance than NBI. In particular,
Table 3 clearly shows an increase of the average areas under the
ROC curves (AUC) in the complete dataset (a detailed analysis
can be found in the supporting materials section). This indicates
that hybrid algorithms improve the ability of discriminating

Note: The results were obtained using the optimal values for A and 01 parameters as shown in the supporting materials. We set for both Hybrid and DT—Hybrid A = 0.5.

known links from predicted ones. The increase of the AUC
values for the DT-Hybrid algorithm demonstrates that adding
biological information to prediction is a key choice to achieve
significant results. Table 4 demonstrates that exploiting biolo-
gical information leads, in most cases, to a signiﬁcant increase
of the adjusted precision and recall. Figure 2 illustrates the ROC
curves calculated on the enzymes, ion channels, GPCRs, and
nuclear receptor datasets using the top-30 predictions. Finally,
it can be asserted that adding similarity makes prediction more
reliable than an algorithm, such as NBI, which applies only net-
work topology to score computation. Indeed, using only known
interactions of a new structure without any target information
makes it impossible to predict new targets for this drug. This
weakness is a problem for all methods based on recommendation
techniques. The introduction of new biological structures is
equivalent to the addition of isolated nodes in the network,
whose weight, based on the equation (1), is always zero. Such
a weight, ultimately, leads to the impossibility of obtaining a
prediction for this new molecule.

Another important feature of the DT-Hybrid algorithm that
we would like to highlight is its ability of increasing performance
by keeping computational complexity acceptable. The asymp-
totic complexity of the NBI algorithm is 0(n2m), whereas
that of DT-Hybrid is 0(n2 (m +  However, parallelization
and optimization techniques can be easily applied to speed
computation.

We investigated the dependence of DT-Hybrid prediction
quality with respect to the a and A parameters (see the support-
ing materials for the details). Results show that we cannot dis-
cern a law that regulates the behavior of the metrics based on the
values of these parameters. They depend heavily on the speciﬁc
characteristics of each dataset, and therefore require a priori ana-
lysis to select the best ones. In the reported results, we made such
analysis before to run our experiments to establish the param-
eters yielding the best results in terms of precision and recall
enhancement.

Finally, notice that our analysis has shown an increase in the
precision, recall and AUC, neglecting other metrics, such as re-
covery, personalization and surprisal. This was done because the
latter measure only the capability of analyzing the structure of an
interaction network without evaluating the biological signiﬁ-
cance of predictions.

4 CONCLUSION

DT-Hybrid is a technique proposed for the prediction of
new interactions between small molecules. Thanks to the
domain-dependent additional knowledge, it clearly outperforms
the NBI algorithm for DTI prediction. DT-Hybrid integrates
biological knowledge and the bipartite interaction network into
a uniﬁed framework. This yields high quality and consistent
interaction prediction, allowing a speedup of the experimental

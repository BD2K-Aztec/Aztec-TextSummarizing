melting temperatures of any DNA or RNA sequence. For DNA, these
can be presently calculated at the salt concentrations given in Owczarzy
et al. (2004), that is, 69, 119, 220, 621 and 1020 mM. For RNA, the
application currently takes into account canonical Watson£rick base
pairs (CG and AU) and can be calculated at 1000 mM (Weber, 2013).
The experimental melting temperatures used for the regression are from
Xia et al. (1998).

Accuracy of the melting temperature calculations For DNA melting
temperatures, the accuracy is around 08°C, which is better than for
NN-model calculations, see Supplementary Table S1. For a full discus-
sion of the accuracy when calibrated to the experimental results by
Owczarzy et a]. (2004), see Weber et al. (2009a). For RNA, the accuracy
is also somewhat better than for NN-model calculations, especially for
non-two-state sequences, as presented in Weber (2013). Further discus-
sions on the expected prediction accuracy and its relation to the experi-
mental data can be found in the Supplementary Section S1.

Average opening (y): The application is capable of calculating the aver-
age helix opening (y) (Peyrard and Bishop, 1989), that is, the average
distance between base pairs, which can be used to gain a better under-
standing of localized openings. This capability goes beyond traditional
nearest-neighbour models (Breslauer et al., 1986), which are limited to
providing a single Gibbs free energy value for a DNA or an RNA se-
quence. Methods based on the PolandiScheraga model (Dwight et al.,
2011; Tostesen, 2008) provide an opening probability proﬁle that can be
interpreted in a similar way to average distances. However, average dis-
tances allow for a more quantitative analysis, such as, for example, the
conclusion that RNA has larger average tranversal fluctuations than
DNA, despite having stronger AU hydrogen bonds (Weber, 2013).

Model matrices: The application provides all calculated model matrices
[Eqs. (56,60,64) of Zhang et a]. (1997)] for a given set of parameters, as
well as the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transfer matrix. This may
be useful for testing other programmes that implement the PB model or
as input for extensions or simulations using this model.

Processing times: For the calculation of average opening proﬁles
such as shown in Figure 1, the typical processing time was <1 s per

Calculations were performed for optimized parameters for the harmonic
PB model (Weber et al., 2009a) at a salt concentration of 69 mM

temperature step on an i7 2.7GHz processor. If the parameters and tem-
peratures are kept constant, the calculation time can be considerably
shortened by storing all matrices on ﬁle, as described in the previous
paragraph. The processing time is linear with the size of the sequence,
as shown in Supplementary Figure S3. For the calculation of melting
temperatures, typical processing times are 10’3s per sequence, as bench-
marked by the calculation of 300 000 sequences from Panjkovich and
Melo (2005).

3 DISCUSSION

In essence, the main parameters of the PB model are the Morse
potential D, which represents the hydrogen bond, and the elastic
constant k, which represents the stacking interaction. The poten—
tial D depends only on the base pair and, as a rule of thumb, is
roughly proportional to the strength of the hydrogen bonds. If
the user wishes, for instance, to experiment with a stronger
hydrogen bond, all that is needed is to set a larger value for D.
In this respect, the PB model offers a much more intuitive frame—
work for setting its parameters than the nearest neighbour
models based on Gibbs free energy (Breslauer et al., 1986). For
instance, in Figure 1a, we show an example for a DNA sequence
where we calculate all opening profiles for a range of tempera—
tures. These opening proﬁles were calculated for open boundary
conditions and therefore clearly show the end fraying of the
DNA sequence. In Figure 1b, we show the same sequence of
Figure 1a but now calculated with periodic boundary conditions,
which would be equivalent to a circular DNA. The characteristic
end—fraying is now absent and generally this structure appears
much more stable at higher temperatures than for open—ended
DNA. Opening proﬁles calculated for a range of temperatures
can be combined into opening maps, such as exempliﬁed in
Supplementary Figure S 1.

In terms of the accuracy of predicting melting temperatures,
TfReg is at least on par with nearest—neighbour free energy
models. Supplementary Table S1 shows the melting temperature
average error when compared for the DNA dataset by Owczarzy
et a]. (2004) compared with the methods implemented by
DNAmate by Panjkovich and Melo (2005) and the phenomeno—
logical model by Khandelwal and Bhyravabhotla (2010). One
should be aware, however, that the accuracy of predictions is
largely determined by the experimental data used to calibrate a
given method. In Supplementary Section S1, we discuss these
issues in more detail. One aspect of interest is that TfReg has
no fundamental restriction on sequence length, as shown in
Supplementary Figure S2, where we present the average accuracy
as a function of sequence length.

As the accuracy of any prediction method depends so strongly
on the dataset used to generate the regression coefﬁcients, it is
worth mentioning that TfReg can generate new regression sets
from user—provided melting temperatures. This means that users
may use TfReg to predict new melting temperatures based on the
calibration of their own data, instead of relying on pre—estab—
lished regression sets.

TfReg

 

Some bioinformatics applications of interest for TfReg would
be the prospective studies of melting for situations where little
melting experimental data are available for certain types of oligo—
nucleotides, given that the parameters are intuitive. The opening
proﬁles could also be used in addition to ﬂexibility for studies
of promoter sequence recognition (Fagundes—Lima and Weber,
2012).

4 CONCLUSON

We provide a complete C++ implementation of the PB model
in the framework of the transfer matrix integral method. In
addition to the calculation of the matrices that are essential
to the method, the application TfReg also calculates melting
temperatures for DNA and RNA, providing thus an alternative
method to the nearest—neighbour Gibbs free energy calculations
(Breslauer et al., 1986). The application also provides the option
of calculating the average helix opening profile. A comprehensive
user manual with full explanation of the main aspects of the PB
model is provided in the software package and also included as
Supplementary Material.

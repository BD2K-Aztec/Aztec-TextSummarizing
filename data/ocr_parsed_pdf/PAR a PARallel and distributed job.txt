ABSTRACT

Summary: Bioinformaticians are tackling increasingly computation-
intensive tasks. In the meantime, workstations are shifting towards
multi-core architectures and even massively multi-core may be
the norm soon. Bag-Of-Tasks (BOT) applications are commonly
encountered in bioinformatics. They consist Of a large number Of
independent computation-intensive tasks. This note introduces PAR,
a scalable, dynamic, parallel and distributed execution engine for
Bag-Of-Tasks. PAR is aimed at multi-core architectures and small
clusters. Accelerations obtained thanks tO PAR on two different
applications are shown.

1 INTRODUCTION

Bioinformaticians are signiﬁcant high-performance computing
users, in particular for simulations of biologic phenomena. On
the other hand, the available hardware is not only getting faster
but also much more parallelized (Intel publicly reported working
on 80 cores prototype chips in 2007). In this context, most
bioinformaticians could beneﬁt from an easy-to-use software to
harness such computing power.

The focus of this note is Bag-of—Tasks (BOT) applications
execution. As the name suggests, BOT applications can be seen as
a bag, ﬁlled with tasks to do, each being independent from all the
others. A middle-ware for BOT applications is called a job crusher.
It has to consist of at least a server component connected to a set of
clients.

This note introduces PAR, a parallel and distributed job crusher
working in pull mode and inspired by desktop grid platforms.
Workers join the computation and can be added dynamically
at run-time; the server delivers tasks to workers available at a
given moment. PAR is actually a transposition of some concepts
and features from previous distributed middle-ware to small HPC
clusters and multi-core workstations.

This article is organized as follows: Section 2 presents an
overview of related projects and technologies used in bioinformatics.
Section 3 presents two examples using PAR to illustrate scalability.
The last section lists upcoming enhancements.

2 RELATED PROJECTS

A wide variety of tools and technologies have been used over the last
two decades in bioinformatics. While PAR is a user-level tool with
its own niche, it has some limitations. At the cost of a little more
complexity, some of the tools listed hereafter allow fair share of
resources, stronger reliability and even faster job or data throughput.

At the programming level, the Message-Passing Interface [MP1,
Forum (1994)], CORBA (Object Management Group, 1998) or
even MapReduce (Dean and Ghemawat, 2004) are noteworthy
technology candidates.

MPI has become the de facto stande for programming highly
parallel applications. It has been used in computational genomics
(Swain et (11., 2005) and in molecular dynamics (de Lomana et (11.,
2008; Johnston et al., 2005).

For applications following a client-server model, CORBA can be
used. Handling of genome maps has successful examples (Hu et (11.,
1998; Jungfer and Rodriguez-Tome, 1998).

For data-intensive applications, MapReduce and its open
source implementation Hadoop (http://hadoop.apache.org) are more
appropriate. They unleash operations over huge amounts of data
and were used recently in sequence alignment (Sadasivam and
Baktavatchalam, 2010).

However, at the application level, Desktop Grids (DG) are closer
to the focus of this note. A server distributes tasks to workers
located on machines that do not communicate with each other,
potentially anywhere on the Internet. Condor (Litzkow et (11., 1988),
XtremWeb (Fedak et (11., 2001) and BOINC (Anderson, 2004)
are three platforms for highly parallel, multi-user applications.
One of the best-known DG project in bioinformatics is probably
Folding@home (Beberg et (11., 2009).

Like Hadoop and unlike most DG, PAR is designed to be used
exclusively on private resources. PAR’s ideal scale is then smaller
than what DG systems usually target, but this permits a lower
latency. For simplicity, PAR uses pull-driven task distribution. This
removes the need for a complex software component (called a
scheduler) and also allows to scale smoothly even in large, dynamic
and heterogeneous environments. In addition, PAR never requires
administrator privileges and is only run on-demand.

3 EXAMPLE USE

The ﬁrst example experiment consists of computing Alpha Carbons
Root Mean-Square Deviation after optimal superposition, noted
CaRMSDopt hereafter, on one thousand ab initio generated
structures for the protein target 256B. Distances between proteins
are computed using the software from (Zhang and Skolnick, 2004).
The second experiment performs molecular replacement (MR), a

method of solving the phase problem in X-ray crystallography
using homologous structures, on a set of 192 decoys for the protein
target lm6t. We present the time elapsed with and without using
PAR. PAR in parallel mode uses several cores of a given computer
while the distributed mode uses distinct computers. The current
implementation of PAR is known to work well with up to 16 and 64
CPUs in parallel and distributed mode, respectively.

Prior to timing experiments, needed programs and data were
copied to each machine by the user. During experiments, PAR
was started in server mode with a list of commands to execute.
Workers were started soon after the server, but could have joined the
computation later if we were not interested in the shortest completion
time. The Unix ‘time’ command was used and averaged over two
trials to measure the real time spent by PAR to complete all tasks.
Unlike previous job crushers, PAR server’s life cycle is only tied
to the application’s execution time (no Unix daemon involved) and
PAR runs only in user space.

Results are shown in Figure l. The ﬁrst bar is the real time
elapsed when not using PAR. The second bar is the time spent when
using PAR in parallel mode, and the following bars are durations in
distributed mode. On a CPU-intensive task and when using 16 CPUs,
the speedup obtained by PAR can be as high as 14.01 in the parallel
case and 15.54 in the distributed one. Lower performance of the
parallel version is attributed to Python’s problem with multi-thread
applications (the Python interpreter uses a global lock mechanism
shared by all threads). We can see that the application scales
remarkably well. The overhead due to communications between
workers and the master is very small, and this allows for an effective
use of the parallel hardware with minimum effort required on the
user’s side.

4 FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS

PAR can be used on network of Unix-like workstations. It can
take advantage of a Network shared File System (NFS). However,
because of poor NFS performances, data-intensive tasks should
be computed on top of a Distributed File System (DFS). As DFS

are still rare even within clusters, we envisage to plug in such a
functionality into PAR. A prototype has been implemented but is
still in experimental stage.

PAR should integrate fault-tolerance policies, in order to be
used safely even with more workers over longer periods, and with
minimal overhead.

Furthermore, compression could be added to speedup
communications. Encryption would be similarly easy to add
and would allow PAR to be used over untrusted networks.

Finally, features can be added for large-scale experiments. For
example, requesting groups of jobs instead of one at a time would
lower the load on the server part. Allowing PAR to run both as
a server and as a client would allow it to be deployed in layers,
which could be used to connect several clusters together and
increase scalability. Requests and contributions from users are also
considered.

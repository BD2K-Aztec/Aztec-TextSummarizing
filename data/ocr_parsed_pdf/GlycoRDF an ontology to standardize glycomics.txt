Abstract

Motivation: Over the last decades several glycomics—based bioinformatics resources and data—
bases have been created and released to the public. Unfortunately, there is no common standard
in the representation of the stored information or a common machine—readable interface allowing
bioinformatics groups to easily extract and cross—reference the stored information.

Results: An international group of bioinformatics experts in the field of glycomics have worked to—
gether to create a standard Resource Description Framework (RDF) representation for glycomics
data, focused on glycan sequences and related biological source, publications and experimental
data. This RDF standard is defined by the GlycoRDF ontology and will be used by database pro—
viders to generate common machine—readable exports ofthe data stored in their databases.
Availability and implementation: The ontology, supporting documentation and source code used
by database providers to generate standardized RDF are available online (http://www.glycoinfo.
org/GchoRDF/I.

1 Introduction

Over the last decade the growth in publicly accessible data collec-
tions has steadily increased in complexity and coverage in all life sci-
ence fields, including glycomics. However, compared with other
fields, the content of the glycomics databases and the representa-
tions of glycan sequences used in these databases remain diverse and
are not standardized (Campbell et (11., 2014a). The discontinuation

of CarbBank (Doubet and Albersheim, 1992), the first publicly
available carbohydrate structure database (CSDB), in the mid-1990s
led to the development of a number of independent databases and
carbohydrate-related web resources. Many have been developed by
individual research groups and few are collaborative projects, all
providing their own unique datasets and functionalities as reviewed
by Aoki-Kinoshita er al. (2013a, b), Campbell et al. (2014a), Frank

and Schloissnig (2010) and Liitteke (2012). GLYCOSCIENCES.de
(Liitteke et al., 2006 ), one of the earliest web portals for glycomics
data, developed at the German Cancer Research Center was seeded
from the efforts of CarbBank and is now focused on the three—
dimensional conformations of carbohydrates. In the early 20005,
KEGG GLYCAN (Hashimoto et al., 2006) was added to the KEGG
resources (Kanehisa et al., 2012) as a new glycan structure database
that is linked to genomic and pathway information. Around the
same time, the Consortium for Functional Glycomics developed a
glycan structure database to support their glycan array, mass spec—
trometry profiling, glyco—gene knock—out mouse and glyco—gene
microarray data resources (Raman et al., 2006 ). In Russia, the
bacterial (Toukach, 2011) and plant and fungal (Egorova and
Toukach, 2014) CSDBs were developed, containing carbohydrate
structures and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data from bacter—
ial, plant and fungal species collected from the scientific literature.
Meanwhile in Japan, the Japan Consortium for Glycobiology and
Glycotechnology (JCGG) developed a web portal and databases to
integrate all national carbohydrate resources (http://jcggdb.jp/
index_en.html). One of the major databases incorporated into
JCGG database (JCGGDB) is GlycoEpitope (Kawasaki et al., 2006)
(http://www.glycoepitope.jp), which is a database of carbohydrate
epitopes and antibodies, accumulated from the literature. JCGGDB
also has released a glycoprotein database called GlycoProtDB (Kaji
et al., 2012), which contains experimentally verified glycosylation
site information. In 2005, the European Union funded
EUROCarbDB, a design study focused on developing a framework
for storing and sharing experimental data of carbohydrates (von der
Lieth et al., 2011). An integrated module of EUROCarbDB was
MonosaccharideDB (http://www.monosaccharidedb.org), which
provides a controlled vocabulary of unique monosaccharide resi—
dues. The dynamic, self—extensible dictionary and translation rou—
tines of MonosaccharideDB ensure monosaccharide name
consistency and allow translation and mapping of monosaccharide
names used in different resources. After the end of the
EUROCarbDB project, the data resources and software, which are
all available as open source software, were taken on by the
UniCarbKB project (Campbell et al., 2011, 2014b). GlycoSuiteDB
(Cooper et al., 2001, 2003), originally developed as a commercial
database in Australia, contains published glycoprotein glycan struc—
tures together with information on the glycoproteins and further
knowledge of the biological context in which the glycans have been
identified. GlycoSuiteDB has recently become a part of the ExPASy
portal and is now integrated into UniCarbKB. In addition, several
other small databases used in local laboratories have been developed
in parallel providing overlapping or complementary information.
Although all these databases contain valuable data, a lack of
interoperability hampers development of data mash—up applications.
Despite some efforts to standardize and exchange their data (Packer
et al., 2008; Toukach et al., 2007), most glycomics databases still
have to be regarded as ‘disconnected islands” (Liitteke, 2008). The
standardization of carbohydrate primary structures is more difficult
than in genomics or proteomics, partly due to the inherent structural
complexity of saccharides exemplified by complex branching, glyco—
sidic linkages, anomericity and residue modifications. Individual
databases developed their own formats to cope with these problems
and encode glycan primary structures in machine—readable ways
(Aoki—Kinoshita et al., 2013a, b) creating a large collection of in—
compatible glycan sequence formats. GlycomeDB was designed to
integrate all glycan structures and species information from most of
these databases by converting them into one consistent representa—
tion and providing a single web portal allowing for searching across

all these databases for particular structures (Ranzinger et al., 2008,
2009). Using the cross—references to the original databases provided
for each structure, it became possible to access the web pages of these
databases and to retrieve the provided information related to a glycan.
All databases provide their information using web pages, restricting
the query possibilities to the limited search options provided by the de—
velopers. Only a few provide web service interfaces allowing retrieval
of the data in a machine—readable non—Hypertext Markup Language
format. The few web service interfaces that have been implemented
return proprietary non—standard formats making it hard to access and
integrate data from several resources into a single result.

1.1 Integration and sharing of knowledge

The combination and integration of information from several data—
bases are necessary for a better understanding of the biological proc—
esses in which glycans are involved. This requires access not just to
the primary structures but also to associated data such as biological
contexts where glycans have been found (including information on
the proteins to which glycans are linked), specification of glycan—
binding proteins and references to publications or experimental
data. However, this information is still spread over the various re—
sources, which are (e.g. in the context of proteins) not limited to
only glyco—related databases, and stored in different formats and
representation schemes. A model that enables the integration of the—
se diverse data will permit users to answer more complex questions
compared with individual database queries or cross—linking primary
structures would allow. Connecting glycomics resources with other
life science data also enables the integration of glycan information
into systems biology approaches.

The premise for integrating data from multiple heterogeneous
sources is not new. The review by Stein (2003), although focused on
genomics, identified that biological databases have been invaluable
for managing data collections but ‘so far their integration has
proved problematic”. A series of steps to enable data integration was
introduced by Davidson et al. (1995) that included the following:
transformation of existing datasets into a common data model;
matching semantically related data objects and transformation of
data into a federated database on demand.

1.2 Semantic technologies for data integration

The Semantic Web Community has successfully implemented data
exchange and integration solutions based on a series of standards:
the Resource Description Framework (RDF) format (http://www.
w3.org/TR/rdf—concepts/) for documents and the Web Ontology
Language (OWL) for ontology specification (Belleau et al., 2008;
Jupp et al., 2014). RDF is a manner of describing concepts as re—
sources and their linking relations. In particular, RDF defines data
using triples, which consist of three components, subject, predicate
and object, to describe relationships between pieces of information.
Subjects and objects can be Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs),
such that they can be linked across the Semantic Web. Moreover,
objects can serve as subjects to other objects, thus forming a graph,
or network, of triples. Ontologies are further used in RDF to define
classes, which describe the subjects and objects being represented.
OWL is a manner of describing relations in a formal logic that
allows not only specifying the classes and predicates to be used and
their relationships but also for checking integrity and data inconsis—
tencies. An OWL ontology can be defined as an explicit specification
of a conceptualization, which is an abstract and simplified view of
the world that needs to be represented for some purpose (Gruber,
1995). For a given knowledge base or knowledge system, it means

[310'sp2umofp105xo'sopeuHOJIItotq/ﬁdnq

GlycoRDF

that a conceptual language should be used to define the objects and
the relations to be represented. The conversion of data from propri—
etary formats or relational databases to RDF for the purpose of pro—
viding a machine—readable dataset usable for the Semantic Web is a
process commonly called ‘RDFization’.

Recently, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) launched
the EBI RDF platform to coordinate and connect the vast data collec—
tions accumulated across the institute (Jupp et al., 2014). The plat—
form provides an innovative approach to query and explore rich
biological data collections, allowing researchers and developers to
execute searches that were previously not possible. This effort clearly
demonstrates the usefulness and power of semantics technologies.

To make use of the advantages of the Semantic Web and the pos—
sibilities provided by SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query
Language) for querying different glycomics databases, we have
commenced translating databases into RDF and demonstrated the
usefulness of this approach (Aoki-Kinoshita et al., 2013a, b). To
effectively provide diverse glycomics data types including glycan
sequences, biological source information, literature references and
experimental data, a common RDF standard is required. Here, we
present our efforts to develop an ontology for generating standar—
dized RDF for glycan structures and related data (known as
GlycoRDF), which has been agreed and adopted by most database
designers and developers in the glycomics discipline.

2 GlycoRDF ontology

GlycoRDF is an ontology to define the RDF namespace, concepts
and relationships between concepts to be used for exporting glyco—
mics data into a standardized representation using RDF. The ontol—
ogy contains classes and predicates necessary for the diverse data
types used in glycomics databases, and also reuses concepts from
other well—established ontologies, such as UniProt core
(UniProtConsortium, 2012), the Bibliographic Ontology, Dublin
Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) Metadata Terms and Human
Proteome Organization Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO—PSI)
Mass Spectrometry Ontology (PSI—MS) (Mayer et al., 2013). The
objective of GlycoRDF is to minimize the development of multiple
RDF dialects that complicate the querying and mash—up of the infor—
mation across several resources. The development of a standard
format for glycomics information needs to address the diverse infor—
mation in the glycomics databases, which ranges from simple publi—
cations that are attached to a glycan structure to detailed biological
source information and experimental datasets. To capture all this in—
formation, a broad ontology design is required which also has to be
extensible in the future to capture further information. Figure 1
shows a simplified unified modeling language diagram of the major
concepts and classes in GlycoRDF. RDF examples demonstrating
the utility of the classes and properties, described in detail below,
are provided in the accompanying complementary material with
supporting ontology documentation.

2.1 Molecules—the Compound class

The Compound class represents biological molecules and contains in—
formation related to the chemical properties of the molecule (Fig. 1,
bottom middle). There are several more specific subclasses for differ—
ent kinds of molecules, omitted in Figure 1 for simplicity. Glycan
structures are represented in most databases by the Sacc/aaride class
or, more specifically, they can be represented by subclasses of
Sacc/aaride such as Nglyam or Oglyam. Each level in the inheritance
hierarchy contains additional information compared with the parent

class. For example, in addition to the compound properties, each sac—
charide has a sequence in a glycan—specific format, a monosaccharide
composition and can have links to glycan—specific image representa—
tions. The sequence representation for glycans may utilize any known
sequence format, including GlycoCT (Herget et al., 2008),
LinearCode (Banin et al., 2002), International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry (McNaught, 1997), as well as the recently de—
veloped Web3 Unique Representation of Carbohydrate Structures
(WURCS) (Tanaka et al., 2014). There are also classes representing
glycoconjugate structures [molecules that contain not only the glycan
but also other attached molecules (aglycons) such as peptides, proteins
or lipids] that are not shown in Figure 1. These glycoconjugates are
defined by references to a glycan structure, a reference to the aglycon
molecule, such as lipid or protein, and in some cases the attachment
position of the glycan. This hierarchy allows one to represent the com—
monly used glycan and glycoconjugate types, but can also be extended
to include molecules not yet supported by this version. Although the
predicate has_identifier is mandatory, the identifier (ID) used is the
identifier of the compound (glycan) in the database generating the
RDF. Since each database provider is free to use the sequence format
they prefer and there is currently no globally accepted identifier for
glycan structures (Aoki—Kinoshita et al., 2013a, b), mapping RDF in—
formation from a glycan entry in one database to RDF information of
the same glycan entry in another database is not possible using this in—
formation. Therefore, each database provides cross—references to other
database entries describing the same structure where available. In add—
ition GlycomeDB serves as a provider for cross—references not directly
stored in the source database. If the referenced database only provides
web pages, the predicate rdfs:seeAlso is used. If there is an RDF de—
scription available for the glycan in the referenced database, the predi—
cate owl:sameAs is used. With this information it is possible to map
structures from different databases to each other regardless of the ID
and the generated glycan sequence.

2.2 References—the Citation class

The second concept, Citation (Fig. 1, middle left), is used to create
instances of objects representing literature references, such as art—
icles, book chapters or thesis documents describing a glycan. There
are no subclasses and only a few predicates in the GlycoRDF ontol—
ogy for this class. Instead, many predicates from the DCMI (http://
www.dublincore.org) and the Bibliographic Ontology (http://bib—
liontology.com) have been reused to describe and represent publica—
tion information, such as title or authors. It is possible to refer to
other resources describing the publication, such as PubMed
(Wheeler et al., 2000) or Digital Object Identifier (DOI). These ref—
erences are optional, since not all publications are present in D01 or
PubMed; thus, it is still possible to add citations with a comprehen—
sive list of information and no reference to other sources.

2.3 Origin—the Source class

The third major concept, Source (Fig. 1, top middle), describes the
origin of a glycan molecule. There are more specific subclasses, two
of which are shown in Fig. 1, that have different sets of predicates to
represent the source information. If a glycan was found in a sample
extracted from a biological organism (SourceNatuml), the RDF
allows the specification of the organism and the sample location.
Information that can be provided are the species and species sub—
class, organ, tissue, fluid, cell type, cell line, strains, life stage and
related diseases. In addition, it is possible to express that a sample
was derived from an organism (e.g. viruses or bacteria) that was
hosted by another organism. The list of predicates was chosen based

glycans and glycan—related information by different database pro—
viders, we have defined a common RDF standard that many of the
glycomics database providers have agreed upon. By supporting a gen—
erally accepted format defined in the GlycoRDF ontology, querying
the data will be greatly simplified since all glycan—related information
will be represented by the same predicates and terms, making it un—
necessary to map between different RDF namespaces when accessing
information from several resources. The GlycoRDF architecture is
amenable to the inclusion of new features and relevant extensions;
therefore, it is intended to be manageable for long—term use by being
flexible enough to cater for future trends and meta—data descriptions.

GlycoRDF is a future—thinking collaborative effort that addresses
the requirement for sophisticated data mash—ups to answer questions
by combining data from different resources. The standard represen—
tation will connect glycan—related databases and resources ultim—
ately providing a platform that enhances data discovery in
glycomics. As described in the implementation section, several gly—
comics database providers have adopted the RDF standard and now
provide their data in this format. The RDF files can be used by
researchers to access database content and to use the stored informa—
tion for machine learning or create data mash—up applications by
interfacing with other databases, such as protein information from
UniProt. At the same time, the provided web services can be used for
live data requests from the databases for the purpose of data pro—
cessing or enrichment of glycan data with additional information.

There are three major objectives that arise from the described work.
The first is to expand the list of database providers to RDFize more
glycan—related data, and to make these data freely available for data
analysis. The second objective is to link and combine the glycan—related
information with information from other disciplines such as proteomics
and genomics. This will allow researchers to perform queries that are
beyond the scope of the databases of a single domain. For example,
researchers will be able to perform potential queries such as ‘Find gene—
related information of enzymes that took part in the generation of a
glycan structure” or ‘Mash—up protein—related information with the
information of glycans that are attached to the protein”. Future glyco—
mics and bioinformatics meetings will be the perfect stage to present
this work and invite researchers to join this effort. The third objective is
the provision of easy—to—use querying interface through a web interface
rather than machine—readable interfaces designed for computer scien—
tists. Currently, there are discussions to set up triplestores with
SPARQL endpoints that will allow direct querying of the information
without downloading and local handling of the RDF files. It will also
allow for remote querying and mash—up of the information content of
several databases using federated queries.

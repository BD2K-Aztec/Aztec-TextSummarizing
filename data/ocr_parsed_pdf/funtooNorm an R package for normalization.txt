Abstract

Motivation: DNA methylation patterns are well known to vary substantially across cell types or
tissues. Hence, existing normalization methods may not be optimal if they do not take this into
account. We therefore present a new R package for normalization of data from the Illumina
Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip (Illumina 450 K) built on the concepts in the recently
published funNorm method, and introducing cell—type or tissue—type flexibility.

Results: funtooNorm is relevant for data sets containing samples from two or more cell or
tissue types. A visual display of cross—validated errors informs the choice of the optimal number of

in three data sets. Improvement can be substantial; it is strikingly better on chromosome X, where

methylation patterns have unique inter—tissue variability.

1 Introduction

Recently, a normalization method was introduced by Fortin et al.
(2014) specifically designed for the Illumina Infinium Human
Methylation 450 BeadChip (Illumina 450 K) and implemented in
Bioconductor’s minfi package(Aryee et al., 2014). The percentile—
specific adjustments in funNorm are the key feature allowing batch
effects and technical artefacts to have non—constant inﬂuence across
the range of signal strengths.

However, since methylation patterns may differ substantially
across cell types or tissues leading to cell— (or tissue)—type—specific
quantiles, optimal normalization adjustments should capture this.
Here we present an R package for normalization of Illumina 450 K
data, funtooNorm (an extension of the ideas in funNorm) applicable
to such heterogeneous data sets.

2 Methods

Key features of funtooNorm and funNorm are identical, i.e. nor—
malization adjustments are estimated via regression models
applied to a series of quantiles of the probe—type—specific signals in
each sample. Covariates, derived from the control probes, capture
variation not associated with the biological signals of interest. In
funtooNorm, an augmented covariate matrix is constructed by
including interactions between cell—type or tissue—type indicators and
the average signal from each control probe type. Either principal com—
ponent regression (PCR) or partial least squares regression (PLS)
(Tenenhaus, 1998) can be fit (the typefits option); as in funNorm,

Fig. 1. Root mean square error from cross-validation comparing different num-
bers of components in funtooNorm on the Replication Data Set. Separate
model fits are implemented for A and B signals, and for different probe types

normalized methylation values are based on predictions from linear
interpolations between the analyzed percentiles (see Supplemental
Methods).

The function, funtoonorm, operates in two distinct modes:

' Normalization mode: When validate : FALSE, normalization of
the data is performed for a chosen number of components in the re—
gressions. The model—ﬁtting step requires only a set of quantiles for
each sample, and hence is efﬁcient both computationally and in
memory usage. Calculations can be performed in a modular fash—
ion; intermediary results can be saved by setting appropriate ﬂags.

' Cross-validation mode: When validatezTRUE, a graphical dis—
play of root mean squared errors (RMSE) obtained with cross—
validation facilitates choice of an appropriate number of compo—
nents (Fig. 1). Plots are provided for both PCR and PLS ﬁts.

Three data sets are used to illustrate performance (Supplemental
Table S1). In the Replication Data Set, methylation was meas—
ured in ten healthy individuals who contributed 2—3 samples of
each of whole blood, buccal swab and dried blood spots, includ—
ing a mixture of technical and biological replicates. In the
Systemic Autoimmune Diseases Data (SARDS), monocytes and
CD4 +T—cells from incident patients were separated from whole
blood, with repeated samples drawn before and after 6 months of
immunosuppressive treatment. For the Gestational Diabetes
Data (CD), one technical replicate sample was available for each
of fetal placenta and cord blood tissues. Agreement—within a tis—
sue or cell type—is measured by the average (over probes) of the
squared intra—replicate set differences, summed over distinct
individuals.

3 Results

Figure 1 displays the cross—validation RMSE plot for the Replication
Data set with PCR. The optimal number of components varies
across the percentiles and signals; evidently there is substantial im—
provement in mean squared error from 2 to 3 components.

Technical replicate agreement was improved with funtooNorm
compared to funNorm (Supplemental Figs S1 and S2, Supplemental
Tables S2 and S3). Agreement improved by substantially for technical
replicates of whole blood, blood spots, and fetal placenta tissues,
although there was little difference between the methods for buccal
swabs or cord blood. For biological replicates, we saw improvements
of 10—20% in many tissues. Performance was particularly good for
probes on the X chromosome. Supplemental Figure S3 shows that the
distribution across probes of the differences between tissue types is
distinct on the X chromosome; this is captured by our augmented
covariate matrix. A similar argument explains enhanced performance
for some probe annotations (Supplemental Fig. S4). Performance on
the Y chromosome was poor, since with only 416 probes, a quantile—
based model fit is overly complex; we recommend the simpler method
implemented in funNorm for this chromosome.

Normalization of DNA meth ylation data from multiple cell types

4 Discussion

Most methylation studies today are designed to detect inter—
individual differences, rather than inter—tissue differences.
Improved normalization of datasets containing multiple tissues
can be expected to translate into increased power to detect asso—
ciations of interest, due to the inferred reduction in residual
error; funNorm and this extension funtooNorm are designed
with this goal in mind.

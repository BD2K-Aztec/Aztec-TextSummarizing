ABSTRACT

Motivation: With >8 million new cases in 2010, particularly docu-
mented in developing countries, tuberculosis (TB) is still a highly pre-
sent pandemic and often terminal. This is also due to the emergence
of antibiotic-resistant strains (MDR-TB and XDR-TB) of the primary
causative TB agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Efforts to de-
velop new effective drugs against MTB are restrained by the unique
and largely impermeable composition of the mycobacterial cell wall.
Results: Based on a database of antimycobacterial substances (CDD
TB), 3815 compounds were classified as active and thus permeable. A
data mining approach was conducted to gather the physico-chemical
similarities of these substances and delimit them from a generic data-
set of drug-like molecules. On the basis of the differences in these
datasets, a regression model was generated and implemented into
the online tool MycPermCheck to predict the permeability probability
of small organic compounds.

Discussion: Given the current lack of precise molecular criteria deter-
mining mycobacterial permeability, MycPermCheck represents an
unprecedented prediction tool intended to support antimycobacterial
drug discovery. It follows a novel knowledge-driven approach to esti-
mate the permeability probability of small organic compounds.
As such, MycPermCheck can be used intuitively as an additional
selection criterion for potential new inhibitors against MTB. Based
on the validation results, its performance is expected to be of high
practical value for virtual screening purposes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite its ancient origin and the successes of antibacterial
chemotherapeutics introduced >50 years ago, tuberculosis (TB)
is still one of the most widespread and abundant infectious
diseases. In 2010, 8.8 million new cases were documented, par-
ticularly in developing countries (World Health Organization,
2012). Since the discovery of M ycobacterium tuberculosis GVITB)
as the primary causative agent of TB, a complex ﬁrst-line treat-
ment was developed based on the prodrug isoniazid. However,

because of the emergence of multi- and extensively drug-resistant
strains (MDR-TB and XDR-TB), the design of novel potent in-
hibitors is an ongoing challenge (Koul et al., 2011).

An important natural defense mechanism of MTB is its thick
and waxy cell wall providing a ﬁrst powerful barrier against
antibiotic drugs. It consists of a peptidoglycan-arabinogalactan—
mycolic acid core as well as the outmost layer, the so-called
capsule (Draper and Daffé, 2005; Rastogi et al., 1986). It has
been shown that not only hydrophilic agents, but also lipophilic
agents may have severe problems passing the permeability barrier
of the cell wall, owing to the unusually low ﬂuidity of the lipid
bilayer (Liu et al., 1996).

Without the ability to penetrate this cell wall, even most potent
inhibitors of validated mycobacterial drug targets like InhA
(Quemard et al., 1995) will not have any efﬁcacy.
Unfortunately, data about mycobacterial permeability properties
of chemical compounds are hardly available, hampering the
development of knowledge-based methods for permeability
estimation. However, as in most of the cases a compound must
permeate the mycobacterial cell wall to show antimycobacterial
activity, it is reasonable to infer an ability to pass this barrier
for compounds active against mycobacteria. In 2010, Ekins and
colleagues developed a collaborative database (CDD TB)
of >200 000 compounds, which had been tested for antibiotic
activity against MTB (Ekins et al., 2010). Over 3800 structures
showed growth inhibition of 390% at a concentration of 10 uM.
Obviously, these compounds have sufﬁcient permeability to be
active against MTB and may, thus, be used as a knowledge base
for analyzing permeability-determining features. Accordingly, an
extensive data mining approach based on the physico-chemical
properties of this dataset was performed with the subsequent
development of a regression model. With this knowledge-based
classiﬁcation system, the permeability of potential new com-
pounds against MTB can be estimated with high accuracy and
quantiﬁed comfortably.

2 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

2.1 Datasets

The MLSMR dataset (Ananthan et al., 2009) of the CDD TB
database (Ekins et al., 2010; Hohman et al., 2009) was ﬁltered for
compounds that showed a mycobacterial growth inhibition of
290% at 10 MM and a molecular weight <500 Dalton. This
step reduced the total number of considered molecules to 3815
chemical structures. All compounds were converted to 3D struc-
tures with the program Corina (available from Molecular

Networks GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) (Sadowski et al., 1994).
These structures were processed by the tool LigPrep (Version 2.3,
Schrodinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2009) for protonation
(at pH 7.0:l: 2.0), stereoisomerization, tautomerization and sub-
sequent energy minimization. Physico-chemical descriptors
were then calculated for each molecule with Schrodinger
QikProp (Version 3.4, Schrodinger, LLC, New York, NY,
2011). Compounds with incomplete descriptor data were
removed, leaving 3727 structures. This dataset is hereinafter
referred to as Actives.

The foundation of this work is the assumption that a
compound must sufﬁciently well permeate the mycobacterial
cell envelope (consisting of cell wall, periplasm and inner mem-
brane) to unleash its effect within the target cell. Therefore, the
dataset Actives can be classiﬁed as ‘permeable’ (i.e. the corres-
ponding compounds have sufﬁcient permeability to be active).
Far more difficult is the generation of a sufﬁciently large ‘imper-
meable’ (negative) dataset, as only few studies regarding the
permeability of mycobacteria are available (e.g. Hong and
Hopﬁnger, 2004; Jarlier and Nikaido, 1990; Laneelle and
Daffe, 2009; Trias and Benz, 1994). Simply taking the inactive
compounds from MTB activity tests is obviously not possible, as
a lack of permeability may not be the only reason for inactivity.
This issue can be addressed by collecting compounds that are
active against MTB targets in target-based (e.g. enzymatic)
assays, but inactive in a whole-cell MTB assay. This approach
was indeed followed herein to generate a validation dataset
(cf. Section 2.4). The number of compounds obtainable by this
way is, however, by far not sufﬁcient for data mining and
training-set generation. Accordingly, randomly drawn datasets
of drug-like small molecules were used as ‘negative’ data.
These should allow to determine whether the ‘permeable’ sub-
stances show any signiﬁcant differences with respect to random
drug-like compounds. For this purpose, the drug-like subset of
the ZINC database [Irwin and Shoichet (2005), newest version
ZINC12] was processed in the same manner as the Actives.
Thereby, an extensive table of physico-chemical properties of
a randomly distributed dataset of drug-like molecules was
obtained. This dataset is hereinafter referred to as ZINC. An
overview of the datasets used in this survey, as well as informa-
tion about the chemical diversity of the Actives dataset, is avail-
able in Supplement S1.

2.2 Descriptor selection and Visualization

Pairwise Mann-Whitney-U—tests of Actives against ZINC
(several sets of 100 randomly chosen structures each) were
performed for each of the 51 QikProp descriptors. The tests
showed consistent results regarding their P—Values. Figure 1
depicts the distribution of the calculated P-Values using the R
package BioNet (Beisser et al., 2010; R Development Core Team,
2011) for one representative test set including a ﬁtted beta and
uniform distribution. Under the null hypothesis, the P—Values are
uniformly distributed representing only noise. The remaining
part of the P—Values describes the signal distribution. The ﬁtted
beta-uniform—mixture model (Pounds and Morris, 2003) shows a
strong signal of signiﬁcant differences in the physico-chemical
properties of Actives and ZINC. Based on a descriptive repre-
sentation of the 51 distributions (data not shown) and a common

ﬁtted beta distribution (signa1+noise), and the gray line indicates
the ﬁtted uniformly distributed baseline of noise. A clear deviation of
the empirical P-values from the ﬁtted noise distribution is observed, sug-
gesting a strong information content in the differences of Actives and
ZINC

understanding of physico-chemical descriptors for drug develop-
ment, ﬁve QikProp descriptors (P< 0.001) were further
considered:

0 FOSA: The hydrophobic part of the solvent accessible sur-
face area (saturated carbon and attached hydrogen atoms);

0 QPlogPo.w: The logarithm of the calculated octanol/water
partition coefﬁcient (hereinafter called logP);

o PISA: The 7t-interacting part of the solvent accessible
surface area;

0 accptHB: The number of H-bond acceptors;

o glob: The generic spherical surface to molecule surface ratio.

Other common molecular descriptors (e.g. molecular weight
or the number of H-bond donors) were not considered for model
derivation, mostly due to insufﬁcient differences between the
datasets with respect to these descriptors. To increase statistical
signiﬁcance, in all of the following randomly chosen datasets,
the size was increased to 1000 per group. Figure 2 illustrates
the distribution of the ﬁve selected descriptors for a representa-
tive randomly chosen test set of Actives as well as a randomly
chosen ZINC-test set of equal size. The non-overlapping box
notches show signiﬁcant differences in the medians of the distri-
butions of these five descriptors for the two datasets.

can be gained from a comparison with the distribution of the
descriptors in the Actives dataset. For this purpose, four borders
have been deﬁned to better delimit the physico-chemical space
of the permeable substances: upper, up, low and lower (Table 1).
The borders up and low are deﬁned by the 75 and 25% quantile
of the training dataset, respectively. Upper and lower represent 75
and 25% quantile :l: half the interquartile range, respectively.

2.3 PCA and logistic regression method

Although the value mapping of each descriptor for a compound
of interest is useful for later interpretation of results, a reliable
prediction of the permeability cannot be achieved this way. Thus,
the permeability prediction approach is based on multivariate
statistics. First, 25 principal component analyses (PCAs) were
performed based on the ﬁve chosen descriptors using random

Fig. 3. Logistic regression model of PCA coordinate 1 (42.4% informa-
tion content) of 1000 compounds each of the Actives and the ZINC
training sets. The histogram at the top of the plot shows the distribution
of the Actives dataset, whereas the histogram at the bottom represents the
samples from the ZINC dataset. A clear separation of the two distribu-
tions can be observed. The black curve indicates the calculated logistic
regression model based on PC] of the priorly performed PCA. It is
quantiﬁed according to the ‘Probability’ axis, indicating the ﬁnal result
of MycPermCheck

test sets of 1000 permeable substances of the Actives dataset
and 1000 substances of the ZINC dataset. Then, the resulting
coordinates were projected to the ﬁrst principal component.
All PCAs showed coherent results: each time a one-dimensional
representation of principal component 1 (PCI) showed the best
splitting of the two groups Actives and ZINC. Thus, by reducing
the multi-dimensional information space to only the first princi-
pal component (42.4% information content), it is possible to
achieve a maximum separation of these two groups. All PCA
analyses were performed with the vegan R package (Oksanen
et al., 2011).

The PCl coordinates of one representative PCA were then
used to generate a logistic regression model [Fig. 3; ﬁgure created
with the R package popbio (Stubben and Milligan, 2007)] using R
(R Development Core Team, 2011). The obtained logistic regres-
sion function follows:

with a highly significant regression coefﬁcient )3 = 45.187
(P<2 x 10‘”). The variable x represents the input PCl coord-
inate of a given compound. This logistic regression model is the
core of the MycPermCheck tool for estimating the likelihood of
permeability. During the permeability prediction procedure, any
potential inhibitor of interest is processed in MycPermCheck
by these steps: (i) ﬁrst, the principal component coordinates

are calculated according to the existing PCA of the training data,
(ii) then, the coordinate of PC1 is used as input (x) for the logistic
regression model. As a result, the user receives a calculated prob-
ability [0<P(z) < 1] of a compound to be classiﬁed as permeable.

2.4 Evaluation

For evaluation of the logistic regression model, the ChEMBL
database (Gaulton et al., 2011) was browsed for antimycobacte-
rially active compounds with a minimal inhibitory concentration
(MIC)§ 10 uM, yielding a total of 771 permeable structures
(Permeables) absent in the training dataset Actives. The com-
pounds were prepared the same way as the compounds of the
training set (3D conversion, protonation, stereoisomerization,
tautomerization and energy minimization). After descriptor cal-
culation with QikProp, MycPermCheck was used with the
option Calculate Mean of all Isomeric Forms (as described in
the next section). The calculated permeability probabilities
show a median of 0.987 (:l:0.013 median absolute deviation).
Hence, MycPermCheck yields valid predictions for these antimy-
cobacterial and, thus, permeable substances.

To further evaluate MycPermCheck with biological real-life
data, the intersection of two different datasets was generated:
ﬁrst, the CDD TB (Ekins et al., 2010) was ﬁltered for substances
which show <10% antimycobacterial activity at 10uM, yielding
>190000 compounds. Simultaneously, the ChEMBL database
(Gaulton et al., 2011) was browsed for assays against MTB tar-
gets and filtered for structures marked as active within the data-
base according to their half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50 value) or enzymatic inhibition constant (K,- value)
of flOuM. On the basis of their International Chemical
Identifiers (InChI strings), the intersection of the two datasets
was established, yielding 22 compounds. As an additional filter
criterion, an all versus all similarity matrix was generated based
on the atom pair similarity of these compounds using
ChemMineR (Cao et al., 2008; Carhart et al., 1985). A compound
showing >80% similarity to another compound was removed.
One structure (CHEMBL592712) was affected, yielding a ﬁnal
number of 21 compounds with low IC50 or K,- Values (i.e. activity
against an MTB target in an in vitro enzyme assay), but without
antimycobacterial activity. Based on the assumption that the
most likely reason for the inactivity of these compounds against
MTB is their inability to penetrate the mycobacterial cell wall,
this dataset should be a collection of impermeable compounds.
The 21 compounds (Impermeables) (see structures IM1-IM21 in
Supplement S2) were prepared the same way as the Permeables
and the compounds of the training set. The calculated QikProp
descriptors were then processed by MycPermCheck, again with
the option Calculate Mean of all Isomeric Forms. The obtained
permeability probabilities show a median of 0.188 (:l:0.188
median absolute deviation).

Fifty combined datasets of the 21 Impermeables and 21 ran-
domly chosen Permeables were then created to perform a mul-
tiple Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis with the
R package ROCR (Sing et al., 2005) (Fig. 4a). The single ROC
curves were averaged by true-positive rate (black curve) as well
as by threshold (colored curve). The color scale illustrated in
Figure 4 represents the actual permeability probability that is
used as a sliding threshold for establishing the true- versus

false-positive rate and, hence, the ROC curve. The average ROC
curve shows a fast increase of the true-positive rate without pro-
ducing an equivalent amount of false positives, indicating that
reliable and practically useful results can be obtained with
MycPermCheck for randomly selected permeable molecules. At
a false-positive rate of ,6: 10% (a speciﬁcity of l — ,6 =90%), a
true-positive rate (sensitivity) of 67.2:l:9.5% (SD) is achieved
(i.e. over two-thirds of all true positives already appear at this
cut-off). A less strict false-positive rate of 25% yields a higher
sensitivity of 72.2:l:8.9% (SD). At a permeability probability
cut-off of 0.816, a speciﬁcity of 90% is obtained, whereas a
cut-off of 0.553 matches a speciﬁcity of 75%. These two cut-offs
(rounded to 0.82 and 0.55, respectively) form the basis of the
trafﬁc-lights color code of the web program output, as described
in Section 2.5.

For evaluation of the logistic regression model for three
well-studied classes of inhibitors of the mycobacterial enzyme
enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA), the chemical struc-
tures of 20 mycobacterial inhibitors (not present in the dataset
Actives) were extracted from the literature (Freundlich et al.,
2009; He et al., 2006, 2007; Luckner et al., 2010; Muddassar et
al., 2010; Sullivan et al., 2006). Again, the structures were ﬁltered
for atom pair similarity <80%. After removing one compound
(SPF), 19 mycobacterial inhibitors remained in this test set (see
structures Pl—Pl9 in Supplement S2). These inhibitors cover a
broad chemical range from triclosan and its derivatives (diphenyl
ethers) to arylamides and pyrrolidine carboxamides. Again, the
compounds were prepared as before (3D conversion, proton-
ation, stereoisomerization, tautomerization, energy minimization
and QikProp descriptor calculation). The calculated permeability
probabilities show a median value of 0.999 (:l:0.001 median
absolute deviation). Therefore, MycPermCheck yields valid pre-
dictions for these permeable substances.

A second ROC analysis was performed for a combined dataset
of these 19 active substances and the previously detected 21 im-
permeable compounds (Fig. 4b). Regarding the highly active
InhA inhibitors, MycPermCheck shows an even faster increase
of true-positive results than for the randomized evaluation test
sets. At a false-positive rate of ,6 = 10%, a true-positive rate (sen-
sitivity) of 84.2% is achieved, whereas a false-positive rate of
25% corresponds to a sensitivity of 94.7%. The actual perme-
ability cut-offs at these false-positive rates are slightly higher
than those of the multiple ROC analysis of the randomized
evaluation test sets (0.929 and 0.605, respectively). These results
illustrate that MycPermCheck is applicable on inhibitors of the
MTB target InhA.

2.5 Implementation

MycPermCheck is a freely accessible online tool. It is pro-
grammed entirely in perl, making use of the perl packages
Statistics::R for ﬁle formatting and probability prediction with
R and of the CGI-package for displaying browser contents.
Usage of the program begins by accessing the startup screen
(Fig. 5a). Here, the input data [a QikProp comma-separated
values (CSV) ﬁle] must be chosen using the browse function of
the website. The checkbox Calculate Mean of Isomeric Forms
deﬁnes whether all ‘isomeric’ forms of a compound (i.e. tauto-
mers, protomers, stereoisomers, conformers, etc.; indicated and

ability probability in the ﬁrst column after the compound name,
followed by the single descriptor values (Fig. 5b; detailed list of
evaluation data including structures in Supplement S2). For the
single descriptor values, blue-scale colors are assigned based on
the borders deﬁned in Table 1: (i) if the value lies between the
borders up and low, this state is colored light blue; (ii) a value
between the borders up and upper or low and lower, respectively,
is colored blue; (iii) a value below lower or above upper is illu-
strated by a dark blue coloring. This graphical illustration rep-
resents the chemical similarity of a given compound to the
training dataset Actives in terms of the ﬁve most relevant descrip-
tors (see colored descriptor values in Fig. 5b). In contrast, the
quality of each result is rated according to a simple and intuitive
trafﬁc-lights system: for highlighting the permeability probabil-
ity, two borders have been defined based on the ROC analyses of
the evaluation dataset (Fig. 4). The first cut-off of 0.82 corres-
ponds to a false-postive rate of ~10%. Results with probabilities
above this value (>0.82) are marked green. The second cut-off of
0.55 corresponds to a false-positive rate of ~25%. Results above
this threshold are marked orange. Probabilities below 0.55 are
colored red. A download function can be used to save all results
in a CSV ﬁle for further processing by the user.

Besides the use of Maestro QikProp descriptors for estimating
the permeability probability, MycPermCheck is also able to pro-
cess CSV output files of the open-source java descriptor calcula-
tion package PaDEL-Descriptor Hap, 2011). A complete
evaluation of the PCA and regression model for PaDEL descrip-
tor input is available in Supplement S3.

The program is accessible under the following website: http://

3 DISCUSSION

MycPermCheck is an intuitively accessible online tool for
knowledge-based estimation of the permeability of potential anti-
mycobacterial compounds with respect to the MTB cell wall. The
program is based on a chemoinformatic data-mining approach
without any assumptions regarding the uptake mechanism. It is,
hence, generally applicable to drug-like compounds with a mo-
lecular weight <500 Dalton. With statistical signiﬁcance, a train-
ing set of permeable compounds (Actives) could be delimited
from randomly distributed drug-like molecules based on ﬁve
physico-chemical descriptors in a principal component analysis.
Based on the resulting ﬁrst principal component, a logistic-
regression model for estimating the permeability probability
could be derived. Thereby, instead of hard cut-offs for molecular
descriptor interpretation [as, for example, in Lipinski’s Rule of
5 (Lipinski et al., 1997)], a ‘more realistic and gradated descrip-
tion of the continuum of compound quality’ is obtained, an
advantage recently pointed out by Bickerton and colleagues in
the context of their quantitative estimate of drug likeness
(Bickerton et al., 2012).

MycPermCheck was multiply tested on 50 evaluation datasets
of 21 permeable compounds and a set of 21 impermeable com-
pounds. With a standard deviation of true positives of ~9% for a
speciﬁcity of both 90 and 75%, the average of the multiple ROC
curves shows a robust prediction for randomly selected perme-
able compounds (cf. Fig. 4a). Moreover, MycPermCheck was

tested on 19 highly active InhA inhibitors and 21 impermeable
compounds, leading to a good enrichment of the permeable com-
pounds in the range of the highest probability values and of the
impermeable compounds in the range of the lowest probability
values (cf. Fig. 4b and Supplement S2). In fact, among the top 10
compounds (1.0003P30.999), no false positive is found.
Moreover, the 10 lowest ranked compounds (0.002 3 P 2 0.000)
are all true negatives, i.e. impermeables. Comparing the molecu-
lar structures and descriptor values of these two groups of
top-ranked and lowest-ranked compounds indicates that with
only few exceptions permeable compounds are characterized
by a high PISA to FOSA ratio (i.e. the n—interacting surface
area is generally much larger than the hydrophobic surface
area), a logP of >4 and an accptHB value <2. In contrast, the
10 lowest-ranked impermeable compounds show frequently
larger FOSA than PISA values, have low logP values (often
<1) and generally an accptHB value of >5. The compounds
with the highest permeability probability show indeed at least
two aromatic ring systems to which small to moderately sized
hydrophobic substituents and few H-bond acceptors are at-
tached. The impermeable compounds, instead, have often only
one (if any) aromatic ring system andﬁtlespite a signiﬁcant
hydrophobic surface areaia higher polarity and more H-bond
acceptors (cf. compounds IM14-IM21 in Supplement S2).

These observations may provide some guidelines for
ensuring mycobacterial permeability of designed compounds.
Nevertheless, it is also clear that looking at single parameters
only is not sufﬁcient. In fact, simply aiming for descriptor
values that are within the ‘up’ and ‘low’ borders defined in
Table 1 does not ensure a high permeability probability. For
example, compound IM6 shows three descriptor values within
the light-blue range, one within the blue (logP) and only one
within the dark-blue range (FOSA), yet the probability is only
0.472, and the compound is indeed impermeable. Conversely,
compounds with high probabilities may also show descriptor
values in the blue or dark-blue range, as, for example, the top
three compounds P1, P2 and P3 (cf. Supplement S2). Thus, a
‘one-dimensional’ View focused at single descriptor values and
their univariate statistics is indeed of little value. Instead, the
correct combination and relative weighting of molecular proper-
ties is essential, as incorporated in the logistic regression model
based on the ﬁrst principal component: PISA should be larger
than FOSA, logP not too small (rather >3) and accptHB not
too large (rather <5); the descriptor glob plays a minor role in
modulating the probability.

Although the validation results of MycPermCheck illustrate
a high predictiVity, it is also clear that an absolute accuracy
should not be expected. Considering the false positives IM1
and IM2, which both obtain probability values >0.9, their lack
of permeability cannot be explained in terms of the descriptor
values, as they ﬁt the general trends observed for the truly per-
meable compounds. It should be kept in mind, however, that
compounds of the Impermeables validation set are actually
only assumed to be impermeable because of a lack of antimyco-
bacterial activity despite an inhibitory effect in an in vitro
target-based assay. Obviously, this lack of activity may also
have other reasons than mere impermeability. Examples include
the activity of efﬂux pumps and the in vivo degradation/inacti-
vation of a compound. Accordingly, it cannot be ruled out that

IM1 and IM2 are indeed permeable, but inactive for other rea-
sons. Considering false negatives, a few cases are observed as
well. Of the 19 permeable compounds in the validation set, P18
and P19 obtain probability values <0.7. Although these com-
pounds have larger FOSA than PISA values and 576 hydrogen
bond acceptors, they show antimycobacterial activity.

These examples illustrate the limits of the approach, which (i)
does not make any distinction with respect to the uptake mechan-
ism and (ii) is not based on a dataset of experimentally proven
impermeable compounds. Clearly, a sufﬁciently large dataset of
compounds with known uptake mechanism or conﬁrmed imper-
meability would be highly advantageous, both for the derivation of
improved models as well as for a more reliable validation of the
current model. Given the lack of such a dataset, MycPermCheck is
an attempt to make best use of the available knowledge base.

Despite these shortcomings, MycPermCheck is expected to be
of significant practical value for any (Virtual) screening endeavor
dedicated to antimycobacterial drug design. The validation re-
sults indicate that a clear enrichment of potentially permeable
compounds and a highly reliable ﬁltering of impermeable com-
pounds (with P< 0.1) can be achieved with this, to our know-
ledge, unique approach. Accordingly, MycPermCheck may serve
as an additional selection criterion on Virtual screening and as a
utility for increasing the likelihood of obtaining permeable anti-
mycobacterial compounds.

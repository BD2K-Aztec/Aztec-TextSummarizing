Abstract

Motivation: As high—throughput sequencing (HTS) technology becomes ubiquitous and the volume of
data continues to rise, HTS read alignment is becoming increasingly rate—limiting, which keeps press—
ing the development of novel read alignment approaches. Moreover, promising novel applications of
HTS technology require aligning reads to multiple genomes instead of a single reference; however, it
is still not viable for the state—of—the—art aligners to align large numbers of reads to multiple genomes.
Results: We propose de Bruijn Graph—based Aligner (deBGA), an innovative graph—based seed—
and—extension algorithm to align HTS reads to a reference genome that is organized and indexed
using a de Bruijn graph. With its well—handling of repeats, deBGA is substantially faster than state—
of—the—art approaches while maintaining similar or higher sensitivity and accuracy. This makes it
particularly well—suited to handle the rapidly growing volumes of sequencing data. Furthermore, it
provides a promising solution for aligning reads to multiple genomes and graph—based references
in HTS applications.

1 IntrOducuon identified and characterized by simultaneously aligning reads from

A fundamental challenge of high—throughput sequencing (HTS) tech— isolated or metagenomic samples to these reference genomes
(Didelot et (11., 2012; Fricke and Rasko, 2014; Breitwieser et (11.,

2015), which has enormous potentials. Similarly, reads from mouse

one or more reference genomes (Li and Homer, 2010). Read align—

ment is one of the most compute—intensive steps of HTS analysis
(Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), and is becoming increasingly rate—
limiting as HTS technology becomes ubiquitous and the volume of
data from each sequencing run continues to rise. Moreover, as more
genomes are available (Pruitt et (11., 2014), promising new applica—
tions of HTS technology require aligning reads to multiple genomes
instead of a single reference. For example, the genomes of the typical
strains of a species are used as gold standard reference points
(Didelot et (11., 2012), and species or pathogens can be precisely

xenograft models typically need to be aligned to both the human
and the mouse genome. However, it is still not viable to align large
numbers of HTS reads to multiple divergent genomes of various
strains or species simultaneously, primarily due to two limitations.
Firstly, most state—of—the—art aligners are optimized for a single gen—
ome reference. Although they can support almost any reference se—
quence, appending genomes together to make a longer reference
typically degrades performance and decreases accuracy, as many
reads have multiple, equally good matches. Secondly, efforts have

been made to support pan—genome indexing (Schneeberger et (11.,
2009; Huang et (11., 2013; Siren et (11., 2014; Dilthey et (11., 2015);
however, most of the proposed methods organize genomes through
collinear multiple sequence alignment (MSA). These approaches are
useful for highly similar genomes, such as multiple human genomes
(1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012), but not the genomes of
more distant strains or species. Such distant homologues often have
significant structural variants (SVs) (Medini et (11., 2005; Didelot
et (11., 2012) (such as inversions, translocations and duplications), and
collinear MSA could be not suitable for representing these non—collin—
ear events (Kehr, et (11., 2014). In this situation, these approaches may
not be applicable to align reads against multiple divergent genomes,
e.g. a reference composed by a set of microbial genomes. Moreover,
proposed pan—genome indexing methods also have additional limita—
tions. GenomeMapper (Schneeberger et (11., 2009) and BWBBLE
(Huang et (11., 2013) can only integrate relatively small variants (such
as SNPs and small indels). The size of generalized compressed suffix
array index (Siren et (11., 2014) could exponentially increase, which
could not be suited to handle the variants in repetitive regions
(Valenzuela et (11., 2015). Dilthey et al. (2015) proposed an aug—
mented MSA—based graph (named as population reference graph,
PRG) to better support diverse kinds of variants. In this approach, the
de Bruijn graph of the reads is aligned with PRG to infer the donor
genome. This approach falls between de novo assembly and the align—
ment of genome sequences. It is suited to the inference of the complex
genomic regions, such as the MHC region. However, it is mainly de—
signed for local regions, and due to the lack of effective approach to
index the PRG of whole genome, it is still non—trivial to extend this
approach to the read alignment against whole genome. Besides the
aforementioned limitations, MSA—based aligners also have lower
speed, e.g. 10—100 times slower than state—of—the—art aligners (Huang
et (11., 2013; Siren et (11., 2014). Meanwhile, the MSA itself may also
affect the result of read alignment, as there is still not a standard
method to implement the MSA of genomes (Paten et (11., 2014).

Most of the state—of—the—art generic aligners are based on seed—
and—extend approach (Li and Durbin, 2010; Dobin et (11., 2012;
Langmead and Salzberg, 2012; Marco—Sola et al. 2012; Mu et (11.,
2012; Li, 2013). They are superior to backtracking suffix tries [uti—
lized, e.g. BWA (Li and Durbin 2009)] for the increasing read length
of HTS technologies, which requires large edit distance. Generally,
seed—and—extend aligners consist of two steps: (i) seeding: the inference
of putative read positions (PRPs) from the matches (hits) of tokens
(seeds) between the read and reference genome; and (ii) extension:
alignment of the read to the region surrounding each PRP to deter—
mine the most likely read p0siti0n(s). One of the major bottlenecks
faced by this approach is how to handle repetitive genomic regions,
even in the context of a single genome, for example, over 50% of the
human genome comprised repeats (Treangen and Salzberg, 2012).
Because of repeats, many seeds have numerous hits, and the cost of
extending all of them is prohibitively high. This problem is even more
serious for a reference consisting of multiple genomes, as it will be
even more repetitive due to the homologous sequences. Various strat—
egies have been developed to handle hits more effectively, including
heuristically filtering the hits (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012; Mu
et (11., 2012), limiting the number of hits per seed (Li and Durbin,
2010; Marco—Sola et al. 2012) or merging hits before extension (Li
and Durbin, 2010; Dobin et (11., 2012; Li, 2013). However, as all of
these strategies process each hit independently, it could be also expen—
sive to evaluate, sort and prioritize the numerous hits. After these
steps, however, there could be still a number of candidates left for ex—
tension due to the repeats, and the cost of separate alignment of the
read to each of them could still be prohibitive.

To improve the alignment of reads to multiple references, as well
as the handling of repeats within a single genome, we propose the de
Bruijn Graph—based Aligner (deBGA), which uses a graph—based seed—
and—extension algorithm to align reads to one or more genomes that
have been organized and indexed by a Reference de Bruijn graph
(RdBG). de Bruijn graph and A—Bruijn graph were used for the align—
ment of genomes (Raphael et (11., 2004); however, they have not been
fully utilized for HTS read alignment. deBGA takes the advantage of
the non—branched paths of RdBG (i.e. unipaths; Gnerre et (11., 2011)
to recognize similar seeds and identical local sequences, which enables
it to simultaneously evaluate multiple PRPs located in the same uni—
path, regardless of the repetitiveness of the corresponding seeds. This
greatly reduces the computational burden caused by repeats. Due to
its handling of repeats, deBGA is substantially faster than other state—
of—the—art aligners. Furthermore, to our knowledge, deBGA is the first
viable solution which can align reads to multiple genomes with high
throughput and without restriction on the types of variants.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Overview of the deBGA method

deBGA builds an RdBG to organize one or more reference genomes,
and uses a hash table—based data structure, Reference de Bruijn
graph Index (RdBG—Index), to index the unipaths of the RdBG in—
stead of the original sequence (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1).
This novel genome index provides two fundamental operations to

Fig. 1. A schematic illustration of the deBGA method. (a) The organization
and indexing of reference. The reference (consisting of one or more gen-
omes) is collapsed into an RdBG. As the copies of a k—mer within the refer-
ence collapse to the same vertex of the RdBG, the repetitive sequences of the
reference (the segments with various colors) collapse to various unipaths
(the hollow dots with the same colors corresponding to the repetitive se-
quences). Further, the unipaths are indexed by RdBG-Index, a hash table-
based data structure (Supplementary Fig. 81). (b) The read alignment
method. The k—mers of the reads are used as seeds and matched to the verti-
ces of the RdBG through RdBG-Index (the solid vertices). deBGA takes advan-
tage of the property of RdBG to merge seeds having similar PRPs through
unipaths, which can efficiently process repetitive seeds (Section 2,
Supplementary Fig. 82). For each of the merged seeds (the blue and red rect-
angles), if all the local sequences around its PRPs are within the same unipath
(the case of ‘read2'), the read is directly aligned with the unipath (the red
dashed arrows) for simultaneously performing the corresponding extensions
(Supplementary Fig. S3); otherwise, deBGA clusters the local sequences ex-
tending outside the unipath on-the-fly, and separately aligns the read with the
clustered local sequences (the blue dashed arrows) (Color version of this fig-
ure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

recognize and merge similar seeds as well as identical local se—
quences by taking the advantage of the unipaths of de Bruijn graph.
With the RdBG—Index, multiple similar seeds and identical exten—
sions within the same unipath can be simultaneously handled re—
gardless of their repetitiveness. deBGA utilizes the functions of
RdBG—Index for implementing a graph—based seed—and—extension
approach which can well—handle the repeats within the reference to
reduce the cost of read alignment. A schematic illustration of the
deBGA method is in Figure 1b.

2.2 Indexing reference genome with RdBG—Index

deBGA initially builds a de Buijn graph of the reference genome
(RdBG) with a user—defined k—mer length (—k option in the software).
The vertices and edges of the RdBG are simply derived from all the
(k+ 1)—mers of reference genome. deBGA investigates the in— and
out—degrees of the vertices to recognize the starting vertices of the
non—branched paths (i.e. the unipaths) of RdBG, and derives the uni—
paths by traversing the graph from the starting vertices. The se—
quences of the unipaths (unitigs) are then generated by collapsing all
the vertices of the corresponding unipaths. As a unitig may have
multiple copies in the reference genome, for each of the unitigs,
deBGA also records the starting positions of all its copies. RdBG—
Index is then built for indexing the unitigs. It consists of three major
data structures (Supplementary Fig. S1 b):

i. A linear table (UTseq) records the unitigs, and a speciﬁc identi—
ﬁer (UID) is assigned to each of them.

ii. A hash table (UTk_me,) indexes all the k—mers of the unitigs. For
each k—mer, UTk_me, records its token as well as its unipath co—
ordinate, i.e. the UID of the unitig which the k—mer occurs, and
the offset of the k—mer on the unitig.

iii. A linear table (UTPOS) records the starting positions for all the
copies of the unitigs.

This index provides three major functions: (i) retrieving the unipath
coordinate for a given k—mer (including the offset of the k—mer within
the unipath), (ii) retrieving all the genomic positions corresponding to
a given unipath coordinate and (iii) retrieving the corresponding unitig
for a given unipath. It is worthnoting that, for any k—mer of the refer—
ence genome, its unipath coordinate is unique, as it appears exactly
once in RdBG. Moreover, the genomic positions of any given k—mer
can be obtained by jointly retrieving UTk_me, and UTPOS. Using the
three functions, the following two operations are implemented to
merge similar seeds as well as reduce identical extensions.

2.2.1 Recognizing similar seeds through unipath decomposition

All the copies of a k—mer within the reference genome collapse to the
same vertex of the RdBG. This property indicates that a k—bp—long
seed’s hit on the reference genome essentially connects the seed and
a certain vertex of RdBG, i.e. the hits of the seed are exactly the
short token matches on the various copies of the same unitig. Thus,
the hit at the ith copy of the unitig, Gfﬁt, can be represented as
Gfﬁt : GiU + (Oh,t — 1), i : 1, . . ., CU, where CU is the number of
the copies of the unipath, GiU is the starting position of the ith copy
of the unitig, and Chi[ is the unitig offset of the seed. Considering
that, for each of the hits, a specific PRP can be estimated as a gen—
omic position around Gfﬁt — (Omd — Eindel — 1), where Omd is the
seed’s offset on the read and Eindel is the effect of indels, all the PRPs
can be decomposed by the GiU, Obit, Omd and Eindel values
(Supplementary Fig. $23). It is also worthnoting that when inferring
PRPs, most aligners consider the effect of indels (Eindel) as a constant
(e.g. considering it as a limited size of indels).

In this situation, if two seeds hit the same unipath, it is possible
that they have two similar sets of PRPs (Supplementary Fig. S2b).
More precisely, for each copy of the unipath, the distance between
the corresponding PRPs of the two seeds can be represented as
 Z  _ Olltit) _ (Ogead _ Ofead) )’ Where Ofead and Ogead are
the read offsets, and 03m and Oﬁit are the unitig offsets of the two
seeds, respectively. This distance is regardless of the GiU values, i.e.
on all the copies, the distance between the corresponding PRPs is
exactly the same. Thus, it is easy to directly assess the difference be—
tween the two PRP sets by Dﬁﬁp, without separately investigating
the specific PRPs. Furthermore, if this value is smaller than the max—
imal allowed length of indels (usually a few tens of base pairs), the
two seeds can be considered as having similar effects to the seed—
and—extension process and they can be safely merged without loss of
important PRPs.

In practice, it is easy to check whether two seeds connect to the
same unipath through UTk_me,. If so, the Dﬁﬁp value can be calcu—
lated to investigate the similarity of the seeds. deBGA takes advan—
tage of this property to generate and merge seeds without separately
investigating their hits.

2.2.2 Recognizing identical local reference sequences through
unipath embedding

For a given seed, it is easy to directly investigate the distance be—
tween its unipath offset and the two ends of the unipath to deter—
mine whether the unitig can accommodate the local sequences to be
aligned with (i.e. embedded in the unipath). If so, all the extensions
for the seed involve aligning the read to the various copies of the uni—
tig. In such cases, the extensions can be reduced to a specific align—
ment between the read and the unitig itself, regardless of the number
of the hits (Supplementary Fig. S3). In practice, given a seed, deBGA
retrieves UTk_me, and UTseq to determine whether it implies a set of
identical local sequences. If it does, deBGA aligns the read against
the retrieved unitig to simultaneously accomplish the extensions.

2.3 Workflow of read alignment

A ﬂowchart of read alignment is in Supplementary Figure S4.
deBGA aligns a read in several iterations. In each iteration, deBGA
generates a set of seeds (i.e. ‘re—seeding’) to adapt to the divergence
of the read. The main idea of this iterative process is to use fewer
seeds to more efficiently align less divergent reads and to use more
seeds in later iterations to sensitively align more divergent reads.
Three user—defined parameters, R5 (the number of iterations of re—
seeding, -5 option in the software), Is (the minimal interval of seed—
ing, -i option in the software) and Mhit (the maximum allowed num—
ber of hits per seed, -n option in the software) decide the number of
iterations and the generation of seeds in each iteration.

More precisely, in the rth iteration (r: 1, . . ., Rs), deBGA tries
to generate seeds every (Rs — r+ 1)><Is bp on the read. The align—
ment is implemented in the graph—based seed—and—extension strategy
which mainly consists of four steps: (i) using k—mers to find the max—
imal exact matches between the read and the unipaths of RdBG as
seeds, (ii) merging seeds within the same unipath to reduce seeds
implying similar PRP sets, (iii) splitting and regrouping the remain—
ing seeds to further merge hits at similar genomic positions and (iv)
for each of the regrouped seeds, if all the local sequences around its
PRPs are within the same unipath, directly aligning the read against
the unipath to simultaneously accomplish the corresponding exten—
sions, otherwise, clustering the local sequences from unipaths 0n—
the—ﬂy, and separately aligning the read against the clustered local

9103 ‘Og JSanV uo seleﬁuv 50'] ‘BIIIJOJIIBD JO AJtSJQAtuf] 112 /310'S[BIIJHO[pJOJXO'SOIJBLUJOJIIIOICI”Idllq 11101} pepBopI/noq

sequences. Steps (i), (ii) and (iv) particularly take advantages of the
two operations mentioned above.

In each iteration, if the edit distance of the best end—to—end align—
ment found is smaller than a pre—defined threshold, CED (—c option
in the software), deBGA considers that the read is confidently
aligned and stops the process early. The obtained optimal and sub—
optimal alignments will be outputted as results. However, if the read
still cannot be successfully aligned after Rs iterations, deBGA resets
the seed density to Rs X I 5 bp, and ignores the limitation on the num—
ber of hits per seed, i.e. sets Mhit : 00, to deal with very repetitive
reads. In practice, for most reads, the algorithm finishes in only a
few iterations by finding an alignment with edit distance much
smaller than CED.

It is also worthnoting that there is a heuristic in deBGA for han—
dling very divergent reads. If there is at least one match between
seeds and reference in a given iteration, but no successful alignment
is obtained, deBGA can dynamically adjust the early—stop condition,
depending on the user setting. That is, in the following iterations,
deBGA can dynamically adjust CED according to the user setting of
—cl option, or accept the best obtained local alignment as a result if
the —local option is set. If neither of the two options are set (the de—
fault setting of deBGA), the heuristic will not be used. This heuristic
is beneficial for effectively handling large number of sequencing
errors, e.g. simultaneously improving the sensitivity and throughput
of the alignment of the reads having many low quality bases.

2.4 Seed generation

deBGA finds maximal exact matches between the read and the uni—
tigs as seeds (called ‘Uni—MEM seeds’). A Uni—MEM seed is gener—
ated initially by a k—mer match from the read to a specific unitig,
and the match is subsequently extended until it meets a mismatch or
the end of either the read or the unitig (Supplementary Fig. S5a). In
practice, for the rth iteration (r: 1, . . ., Rs), deBGA extracts the k—
mers starting at every (Rs — r + 1)><Is bp from the read as candidates,
and tests each of them from upstream to downstream. As a Uni—
MEM may cover multiple candidate k—mers, deBGA will neglect the
untested positions which have already been fully covered by an
existing Uni—MEM.

A Uni—MEM seed can be formulated by a tuple
(SR, SUlD,SU0ffm,vaeu Shit). The combination of SR, Sud) and
Suoﬁrset depicts the connection between the read and the RdBG
(called a ‘read—RdBG connection’), where SR indicates the seed’s off—
set on the read, Sud) and Suoffm, respectively indicate the identifier
and the offset of the unitig. Scover is a bit—vector recording the read
positions covered by the seed, and Sh,t is the set containing all the
hits of the seed.

A Uni—MEM seed can be also seen as an implicit combination of
a series of continuous [2 bp seeds (Supplementary Fig. S5b). Because
of the property of the RdBG, all such seeds imply identical PRP sets,
i.e. they are practically equivalent for the read alignment process,
and a Uni—MEM seed implicitly merges them.

2.5 Seed reduction within same unipath

deBGA bins the Uni—MEM seeds in terms of their unipaths to reduce
seeds implying similar sets of PRPs. For each bin, deBGA chooses
the seed having largest coverage length as the ‘merging seed’, and
checks whether each of other seeds in the bin can be merged. If it
can be merged, deBGA removes the seed and merges its Scover vector
into that of the merging seed (Supplementary Fig. S6). The merging
condition is as following, assuming the read—RdBG connections of
the merging seed and the testing seed are, respectively,

(sg,sﬁD,sM ) and (535%,?

Uoffset Uoffset

), if the value of

‘(Slgoﬁm — $50M) — (Sad — SE)‘ is smaller than the maximal

allowed length of indels, the two seeds are considered similar and
merged. Here, the maximal allowed length of indels is used for con—
sidering the effect of small indels during the merging process, and
the parameter is empirically set as 32. When a merging seed cannot
merge any remaining seeds in the same bin, deBGA sets it aside and
chooses a new one from the remaining seeds to continue this proced—
ure, until no seeds remain.

2.6 Seed merging across unipaths

Seeds within various unipaths may have hits at nearby genomic p0s—
itions. deBGA merges these similar hits using a split—and—merging
approach. For each seed remaining from the last step, deBGA splits
it into a set of individual ‘hit—seeds’, i.e. each of them inheriting the
read—RdBG connection and read coverage from the original seed,
but only associated with a specific hit. All the hit—seeds are binned in
terms of their positions. For each bin, the hit—seed with largest read
coverage length is selected, and other hit—seeds are merged into it by
simply merging their Scover bit vectors. Next, deBGA regroups the
merged seeds which have identical read—RdBG connections and read
coverage vectors. The seeds generated by the regrouping are con—
sidered as candidate seeds for extension.

To avoid unnecessary extensions, deBGA pre—filters out all can—
didate seeds with coverage length 2k bp shorter than that of the
largest seed. For paired—end reads, deBGA also filters out the hits on
each end of the read that cannot be paired with any hit on the 0p—
posite end.

2.7 Seed extension with identity checking

For each candidate seed, deBGA investigates the local structure of
the RdBG around the seed to recognize whether the corresponding
unipath can accommodate the local sequences for extension. If so, a
simultaneous extension will occur because the corresponding local
sequences are identical (Supplementary Fig. S3). Otherwise, deBGA
extracts and clusters all the local sequences around the PRPs of the
seed, and separately aligns the read against each of the clustered se—
quences. It is worthnoting that the employed local sequences are not
always as long as the read shown in Supplementary Figure S3. If
that happens, deBGA, respectively, extends both sides of local se—
quences at an extra 32 bp (i.e. the maximal allowed length of indels)
to cope with potential indels. Landau—Vishkin (Landau and
Vishkin, 1986) and banded Smith—Waterman (Li, 2013) algorithms
are used to implement end—to—end and local alignment, respectively.
After the extension process, the primary and alternative alignments
of the read are chosen based on the alignment score, and a BWA—
like mapping quality is also calculated based on the chosen
alignments.

2.8 Anchoring alignment for paired—end reads

For paired—end reads, deBGA performs additional processing if the
read is unaligned after all the iterations. In such cases, deBGA separ—
ately aligns the two ends of the read with the seeds generated in the
Rs—th iteration (the seeds are recorded in advance). The optimal and
suboptimal alignments of each end are used as anchors, and the 0p—
posite read ends are aligned to the local regions around the anchors
to compose a paired—end alignment. However, if too many bases of
the opposite end cannot be matched in the anchoring alignment, the
single—end alignments of the two ends are separately outputted as
the result.

3 Results

We benchmarked deBGA with two categories of tasks, i.e. read
alignment against multiple genomes and a single genome, to evalu—
ate its ability on various applications. In each of the tasks, a series of
simulated and real datasets were employed to assess its speed, sensi—
tivity and accuracy. Six state—of—the—art aligners, B0wtie2, BWA,
BWA—MEM, STAR, Squlto and GEM, were compared. All the
aligners were run with a variety of configurations (Supplementary
Notes). The benchmarks were conducted on a server with an Intel
Xeon E4820 CPU at 2.00GHz and 1 TB RAM, running Linux
Ubuntu 14.04.

3.1 Read alignment against multiple genomes

3.1.1 Read alignment against multiple genomes of the same species
For many species, there have already been multiple genomes of their
various strains assembled. Previous studies (Schneeberger et (11.,
2009) indicate that it is helpful to align reads against the multiple
genomes of the same species to perform precise re—sequencing ana—
lysis, especially when the strains are divergent. Moreover, this task
is also a fundamental step to read alignment against a library of the
genomes of various species (e.g. the RefSeq database), as such libra—
ries usually record more than one genomes for the various strains of
the same species.

We assessed the ability of the aligners on such tasks with a series
of simulated datasets from Escherichia coli strains at first. We
downloaded the genomes of all the 62 E. coli strains available from
NCBI RefSeq database (Pruitt et (11., 2014) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.g0v/refseq/). Five reference genome libraries, consisting of 1, 10,
20, 40 and 62 strains, respectively, were built (Supplementary Table
S2). For each library, Mason Simulator (Doring et (11., 2008) was
used to simulate 1 million 100 bp Illumina—like paired—end reads
from all the involved genomes (insert size: 500 i 25 bp). Each of the
reads could originate from any strain in the library, and was aligned
to the corresponding composite reference. The sensitivity, accuracy
and speed of the alignment were investigated. The sensitivity is as—
sessed by the proportion of aligned reads; the accuracy is assessed
with two metrics, i.e. the proportions of the reads correctly aligned
by all the alignments and by the primary alignments; and the speed
is assessed using the read alignment time, i.e. the wall clock time of
the execution of the aligner deducting the time of loading index, as
the cost of loading index is constant (Supplementary Notes).

The results (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table S3) demonstrate
that:

i. deBGA is efﬁcient, especially when the reference is more repeti—
tive. To investigate the repetitiveness of the references, we as—
sessed the number of distinct k—mers and the copies per k—mer
(termed as Gk) of the references (Supplementary Table S4). It is
observed that the Gk values obviously increase with more strains
involved, indicating that the references with more strains are
more repetitive and more difﬁcult to cope with, since a seed
would on average have more hits to handle. We also found that
the references with Z 10 E. coli strains have even higher Gk val—
ues than that of human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19),
which is commonly considered as highly repetitive. The results
suggest that deBGA has a substantial improvement on alignment
speed. This is especially noticeable for datasets with more
strains, e.g. on the dataset with 62 strains, it is 2.8—113 times
faster than other aligners. This advantage stems from that simi—
lar seeds and identical extensions are largely merge—and—reduced
with the graph—based seed—and—extension strategy.

ii. Overall, deBGA correctly aligns more reads (98.77—99.95%)
than other aligners. For all the aligners, the accuracies of pri—
mary alignments dropped with increasing numbers of strains.
This is not surprising, as the more strains are involved, the more
homologous sequences there are, and the more reads that cannot
be conﬁdently aligned. In this situation, aligners that output
multiple equally best alignments, like deBGA and BWA (conﬁg—
ured to output up to 1000 results per read), will be less affected
and perform better (especially on the 62 strains dataset).
B0wtie2, Squlto, BWA—MEM and STAR correctly align fewer
reads, although this is likely due to their inherent design. That is,
when reads can be aligned to multiple equally good positions,
candidate positions are randomly selected based on the various
heuristics adopted by the aligners as a result. In this situation, a
proportion of reads could be aligned to wrong strains due to
homologous sequences, or wrong positions in the same strain
due to the repeats of the same genome.

Two simulated datasets from Arabidopsis thaliana strains were
employed to further benchmark the aligners on the multiple gen—
omes of a eukaryote organism. One is from the reference genome of
A. thaliana (TAIR10), and the other one is from TAIR10 plus other
18 A. thaliana strains assembled by 1001 Genomes Project (Gan
et (11., 2011) (the genomes were downloaded from: http://mus.well.
0x.ac.uk/19gen0mes). Similar results are obtained (Fig. 2a and
Supplementary Table S5), i.e. deBGA is at least three times faster on
both of the one and the 19 genome(s) datasets; meanwhile, it cor—
rectly aligned highest number of reads.

We also implemented GenomeMapper (Schneeberger et (11.,
2009), a read alignment tool specifically designed for multiple gen—
omes, on the simulated datasets from the 62 E. coli strains and 19
A. thaliana strains. However, we found that although its accuracy is
comparable (marginally lower) to state—of—the—art aligners, the tool
has a much slower speed (line 161 of Supplementary Table S3 and
line 65 of Supplementary Table S5). GenomeMapper costs about
160—folds more alignment time than deBGA to process only a half of
the E. coli dataset, and nearly 600—folds more time to process one—
tenth of the A. thaliana dataset. This speed could not be well—suited
to handle large amount of HTS data.

To further investigate the effect of repetitiveness on the perform—
ance, we benchmarked the aligners with two additional simulated
datasets which, respectively, are from two divergent E. coli strains
[K—12 MG1655 substrain (NC_000913) and O157:H7 strain
(NC_002695)] and two highly similar strains [K—12 MG1655 sub—
strain (NC_000913) and K—12 W3110 substrain (NC_007779)]. It
is observed that (Supplementary Fig. S7 and Supplementary Table
S3) although aligners outputting multiple best positions (e.g.
deBGA) can still achieve high overall accuracies on both of the two
datasets, all the aligners achieved low accuracies of primary align—
ments on the dataset from the two similar strains. This is mainly due
to that the two similar strains already shared many homologous se—
quences, so that many reads are hard to be confidently aligned to
only one best position. Such results suggest that the accuracy of read
alignment against multiple genomes greatly depends on the similar—
ity of the genomes. If the genomes share many common sequences,
it would be hard to confidently align the reads; otherwise, the reads
are easier to accurately align with confidence.

We used three real datasets from E. coli strains to evaluate the
performance of deBGA at aligning real reads. Two of them are from
E. coli K—12 MG1655 substrain (SRA accession: ERR008613 and
SRR522163), and one is from E. coli O157:H7 strain (SRA acces—
sion: SRR530851). For each of the three datasets, 1 million paired—

Fig. 2. Benchmarking on the datasets from Escherichia coli strains. (a) Results on the simulated datasets from 62 E. coli strains and 19 Arabidopsis thaliana
strains; (b) results on the three real E. colidatasets. For each of the datasets, ‘Reads/s' indicates the number of reads aligned per second. ‘Correct aligned%' indi-
cates the proportion of reads aligned to their correct positions by at least one alignment. ‘Aligned to the correct strain%' indicates the proportion of reads aligned
to the correct strain by at least one alignment. Each bar in the figure also corresponds to a line of Supplementary Tables 83, 85 and 86 (the corresponding lines

are highlighted)

end reads were randomly extracted and aligned to the reference con—
sisting of all the 62 E. coli strains. Two sensitivity metrics were as—
sessed, i.e. one is the proportion of aligned reads, and the other is
the proportion of reads aligned to the correct strain. The latter met—
ric is more critical to the read alignment against multiple genomes,
and also reﬂects the accuracies of the aligners. The speeds of the
aligners were also assessed by the alignment time.

The results suggest that, with its default setting, deBGA is overall
at least three times faster than BWA and GEM, and many times faster
than other aligners (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table S6). Further, a
portion of real reads had many low—quality bases, especially the longer
Illumina MiSeq datasets (i.e. SRR522163 and SRR530851). deBGA
addresses these reads more efficiently using an early—stop heuristic (—cl
parameter, optimum setting: 0.35, refer to Section 2). With the heuris—
tic, it is about 4—114 times faster than other aligners.

deBGA also aligned more reads to the correct strain (98.55%,
88.38% and 96.39% for the three datasets, respectively) than other
aligners, suggesting that it is sensitive. Meanwhile, for all the data—
sets, the numbers of reads aligned to the correct strains (i.e.
NC_000913 for ERR008613 and SRR522163, and NC_002695 for
SRR530851) by deBGA are much higher than other distant strains
(Supplementary Fig. S8 and Supplementary Table S7). This signal
may be useful for a wide variety of applications, such as pathogen
identification. Meanwhile, other close homologues such as NC_
007779, NC_010473, NC_012759, NC_017625 and NC_017638
for the K—12 MG1655 substrain, and NC_017906, NC_011353,
NC_002655 and NC_013008 for the Ol57:H7 strain, have similar
numbers of reads aligned. This is also reasonable as these genomes
share many homologous sequences, thus many reads could also have
equally best alignments on these genomes.

3.1.2 Read alignment against multiple genomes of various species
There are also many applications requiring aligning reads against
the genomes of multiple species. For example, in many

metagenomics studies, it needs to align reads to a large set of known
genomes; it is also essential to align reads from mouse xenograft
models to both of the human and the mouse genomes. Such tasks
are still non—trivial to state—of—the—art approaches. We used simu—
lated and real datasets to benchmark deBGA on such tasks, the
aligners shown good performance in the previous tasks, i.e. BWA—
MEM, BWA, GEM and STAR, are compared.

We used Mason to simulate two datasets for evaluating the abil—
ity of the aligners to handle metagenomics reads and xenograft
model reads, respectively. One is from all the RefSeq bacteria gen—
omes, and the other one is from the human (GRCh37/hg19) and
mouse (MM10) reference genomes. Each has 1 million 100 bp
Illumina—like paired—end reads (insert size: 500 i 25 bp).

Three issues are observed from the results (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Tables S8 and S9), which are quite similar to that of
the previous tasks. Firstly, deBGA is at least 4—folds faster on the
metagenomics dataset, and obviously faster on the xenograft dataset
as well. Considering the Ck values of the references (higher than
that of human reference genome, Supplementary Table S4), the
speed suggests the superior ability of deBGA to handle repeats.
Secondly, the sensitivities of the aligners are quite high only except
for STAR on the metagenomics dataset, that about 10% of the reads
are unaligned. Thirdly, deBGA and GEM achieved equally high
overall accuracies, outperforming other competitors. This is also
likely due to the different designs of the aligners for repetitive reads.

As there is lack of ground truth for real metagenomics datasets,
we built a ‘pseudo’ real metagenomics dataset by six real sequencing
datasets from various bacteria genomes, to assess the ability of the
aligners on real data. Each dataset is independently sequenced from
a specific bacteria strain recorded in RefSeq (line 15 of Supplement
Table S1). A total of 250K paired—end reads were randomly ex—
tracted from each of the datasets, i.e. the whole datasets consist of
1.5 million reads. For this dataset, we assessed the speed and the
sensitivity. The results (Supplementary Table S10) suggest that,

similar to that of the real E. 6011' reads, deBGA correctly aligned
highest number of the ‘pseudo’ metagenomics reads with fastest
speed, indicating that the method is potentially very effective to han—
dle the reads from metagenomics samples. It is also worthnoting
that the speed of STAR is comparable; however, it unaligned nearly
5 0% of the reads and the number of the reads aligned to the correct
genomes is even lower, indicating that it may be less sensitive to pro—
cess metagenomics datasets. This is likely due to the heuristics
adopted by STAR which may discard many repetitive reads.

3.2 Read alignment against a single genome

3.2.1 Read alignment against human reference genome

Five simulated and three datasets from human genome
(Supplementary Table S1) were aligned to human reference genome
(GRCh37/hg19). The five simulated datasets are in various read
lengths (100, 125, 150, 200 and 250 bp), which are simulated by
Mason based on GRCh37/hg19, to mimic the datasets from extant

Supplementary Figure 89 for a ‘zoomed-in' view of the results which more
clearly presents the difference between the aligners

Illumina platforms. Each has 1 million paired—end reads (insert size:
500 i 25 bp). Two of the three real human datasets are from the
CEU HapMap individual sample NA12878 which are, respectively,
sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2000 (SRA accession number:
ERR174324) and HiSeq X Ten platforms (downloaded from
Illumina BaseSpace website); and one is from the Yanhuang (YH)
sample (Wang et al., 2008) sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2000 plat—
form (SRA accession number: ERR161544). For each of the three
datasets, one million paired—end reads were randomly extracted for
benchmarking, and only the sensitivities were assessed by the pro—
portions of aligned reads, due to the absence of a ground truth.

Three conclusions (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S9 and
Supplementary Tables S1 1—S14) can be drawn.

(i) deBGA is overall faster than STAR, especially with the fast
61:0.35 setting, but they are comparable. Compared with other
aligners, the superiority of deBGA is more obvious. For example, it
is on average as twice as fast as GEM with the default setting
m:4% (the third fastest tool), even though GEM is less sensitive
with this setting. When GEM is configured to be as sensitive as
deBGA (e.g. m : 8%), it is 7—13 times slower than deBGA.

(ii) deBGA aligns simulated reads with high accuracy. Only
considering the primary alignments, the accuracy of deBGA is
comparable to (i.e. only several tenths of percent lower) that of
BWA—MEM, which is the most accurate. Further, of those reads
not correctly aligned by the primary alignments of deBGA, about
80—90% (on various datasets) were correctly aligned by alternative
alignments with the same or even larger edit distances
(Supplementary Table S12), indicating that it is hard to make the
correct choice for these reads. When considering all the alignments,
deBGA aligned almost all (99.67—99.90%) of the reads to their cor—
rect positions, more than all other aligners on all but one dataset.
On the 100 bp dataset, GEM with m : 6% and 8% configurations

9103 05 isnﬁnv uo se1e§uv 50'] ‘BIIIJOJIIBD 10 AJtSJQAtuf] 112 /310's1cu1n0fp101x0"sothJJOJutotq/ﬁduq 111011 popco1umoq

B.Liu et aI.

 

achieved the same accuracy as deBGA; however, it was 2 and 3.5
times slower, respectively.

As the quality of the alignment of repetitive reads is especially
critical, we investigated the accuracy of the alignment of the 100
and 250 bp reads around retrotransposon regions. The results
(Supplementary Table S13) indicate that deBGA achieved equally
best accuracy for aligning these repetitive reads. This could be bene—
ficial for the analysis of repetitive elements, which is still a difficult
task in genomics studies.

(iii) BWA—MEM and deBGA achieved similar sensitivity on real
data, outperforming other aligners by 1.5—6.1% (Supplementary
Table S14). It is also observed that, with its default settings, BWA—
MEM, respectively, clipped over 50% of their bases for 17 814 reads
from the NA12878 HiSeq 2000 dataset, 25 407 reads from the
NA12878 HiSeq X Ten dataset and 20 381 reads from the YH data—
set. For deBGA with 6120.35 setting, the corresponding numbers
are 7037, 7148 and 14 592, respectively. This indicates the different
design of the aligners, i.e. BWA—MEM favors local alignments,
whereas deBGA aligns reads more globally.

3.2.2 Variant calling with the alignment of deBGA

Variant calling is one of the major applications of read alignment.
We investigated the usability of deBGA on this application by real
datasets. deBGA was implemented on a ~57>< coverage NA12878
dataset (SRA accession numbers: ERR091571—74). The alignment
result was used as input to call variants by GATK HaplotypeCaller
(DePristo et (11., 2011). The called SNPs and indels were compared
with the ground truth set of NA12878 provided by Genome in a
Bottle (GIAB) Consortium (Zook et (11., 2014) and dbSNP ver. 146
(Sherry et (11., 2001). BWA—MEM was also implemented on the
same dataset for comparison.

The numbers of the SNPs and indels called and matched by the
GIAB ground truth sets and dbSNP are in Table 1. It is observed
that, with the alignments of deBGA and BWA—MEM, the numbers
of called SNPs passed the VQSR filter of GATK are within normal
range, and they are comparable to each other. With deBGA, the
pipeline recovered slightly more ground truth SNPs, indicating that
the sensitivity of the deBGA callset could be better. The difference
on the indels is more obvious, i.e. with deBGA, about 5% more
indels recorded in the ground truth set were recovered. This could
be due to that deBGA prefers end—to—end alignment, i.e. this strategy
may produce more consecutive alignments for the reads having rela—
tively large indels. In this situation, the indels would be involved in
the alignment to be informative to variant callers. However, it is
also very worthnoting that this difference only exists for a very small
proportion of the reads and the variant calling results are compar—
able. Meanwhile, it is also observed that the two aligners have com—
parable numbers and proportions of VQSR—pass variants matched
by dbSNP as well. This also indicates that quality of the callsets of
two aligners could be similar to each other.

We also input the alignments of deBGA and BWA—MEM to
state—of—the—art callers to call short tandem repeats (STRs), inver—
sions and duplications, which are more difficult tasks in genome re—
sequencing studies.

The Allelotype module of lobSTR (Gymrek et (11., 2012) was em—
ployed to call the STRs. The result (Supplementary Table S15)
shows that comparable numbers of STRs were obtained based on
the alignments of deBGA and BWA—MEM. We further compared
the two callsets with the STR callset of 1000 Genomes
Project Phase1 data produced by the lobSTR pipeline itself (avail—
able at: http://melissagymrek.com/lobstr—codddownload.html). It is
observed that deBGA and BWA—MEM also have similar numbers of

called STRs which can be matched to the 1000 Genomes Phase1
callset. Considering the numbers of called and matched STRs, the
two callsets are also likely to have similar quality, like that of SNPs
and indels.

Delly (Rausch et (11., 2012) was employed to call two types of
non—co—linear SVs, i.e. duplications and inversions. The results
(Supplementary Table S16) showed that similar numbers of inver—
sions were called with deBGA and BWA—MEM; and the number of
duplications called with deBGA is higher than that of BWA—MEM,
but they are still on the same magnitude. We manually checked a set
of duplications in the callset of deBGA but not in that of BWA—
MEM, and found that this issue is mainly caused by that deBGA
aligned some of the reads as disconcordant pairs; however, BWA—
MEM aligned them as normal pairs but with relatively larger edit
distances (an example is in Supplementary Fig. S10). This may be
due to the different design of the two aligners. Further, we compared
the calls of the two aligners with the SV callsets of NA12878 pro—
vided by 1000 Genomes Project Release3 (Sudmant et (11., 2015),
and found that, with deBGA and BWA—MEM, similar numbers of
variants in the 1000 Genomes Project callset are recovered. This re—
sult indicates that the alignments of deBGA and BWA—MEM may
make the downstream SV caller have similar sensitivities. Moreover,
similar numbers of called SVs are matched as well (the reciprocal
5 0% criterion is used for determining the numbers of recovered and
matched SVs). Considering these similar numbers, the quality of the
callsets of deBGA and BWA—MEM is still comparable to each other.
Moreover, there are still a large proportion of the variants called by
deBGA and BWA—MEM cannot be matched by the 1000 Genomes
Project callset, indicating that, for both of the two aligners, there are
some SV—spanning reads still not well—handled. More advanced ap—
proach could be still needed to improve the quality of the alignment
of SV—spanning reads.

3.3 Additional results

Other features of deBGA, including the time of index construction,
the memory footprint and the performance of multiple threads, were
also investigated. Refer to Supplementary Notes for these additional
results.

4 Discussion

Results on various datasets demonstrated that deBGA can align
reads to one or more genomes quickly and sensitively, making it par—
ticularly well—suited to handle the rapidly growing volumes of gen—
omics and metagenomics data. This advantage originates from its de
Bruijn graph—based organization of references and specifically de—
signed seed—and—extension process, which enables to well handle the
repeats. deBGA is suited to be integrated into many re—sequencing
pipelines. Moreover, this method could be further extended to solve
other important problems, which are also future works for us.

One of the potential works is to extend the approach to better
align reads spanning the breakpoints of large or non—co—linear
events, such as the DNA—seq reads spanning SVs, or RNA—seq reads
which usually have splicing events. The alignment of such reads is
difficult, and critical to many downstream analyses. Graph—based
approach may have its own advantage to this task, as the non—c0—
linear events could be better modeled under the de Bruijn graph
framework, comparing to the linear representation of the reference.
However, the alignment method still needs to be well—designed to
fully take the advantages of the graph representation.

Another potential extension is to use the deBGA method to align
reads against other data structures which can also be split into k—mers,

such as MSA—based graphs. This will make deBGA an important step
toward rapidly aligning reads to variation—aware references representing
a population of genomes, such as the 1000 Genomes Project or the
UK100K (http://www.gen0micsengland.c0.uk/) datasets.

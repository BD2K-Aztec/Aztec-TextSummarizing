Abstract

Motivation: The large variety of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) databases developed to date are char—
acterized by a substantial overlap of data and similarity of sequences. Our goals are to analyze the
levels of redundancy for all available AMP databases and use this information to build a new non—
redundant sequence database. For this purpose, a new software tool is introduced.

Results: A comparative study of 25 AMP databases reveals the overlap and diversity among them
and the internal diversity within each database. The overlap analysis shows that only one database
(Peptaibol) contains exclusive data, not present in any other, whereas all sequences in the
LAMP_Patent database are included in CAMP_Patent. However, the majority of databases have
their own set of unique sequences, as well as some overlap with other databases. The complete
set of non—duplicate sequences comprises 16990 cases, which is almost half of the total number of
reported peptides. On the other hand, the diversity analysis identifies the most and least diverse
databases and proves that all databases exhibit some level of redundancy. Finally, we present a
new parallel—free software, named Dover Analyzer, developed to compute the overlap and diversity
between any number of databases and compile a set of non—redundant sequences. These results
are useful for selecting or building a suitable representative set of AMPs, according to specific
needs.

Availability and implementation: The regularly updated non—redundant sequence databases and
the Dover Analyzer software to perform custom analysis are available at http://mobiosd—hub.com/

1 Introduction

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as an alternative solu—
tion against multi—drug—resistance infections (Engler et al., 2012).
These compounds are part of the innate host defense system in verte—
brate and invertebrate organisms and exhibit a broad—spectrum ac—
tivity against a variety of pathogens, including bacteria and fungi.
Additionally, antitumor (Gaspar et al., 2013), antiviral (Jenssen
et al., 2004) and antiparasitic (Mor, 2009) activities have been
described for some of these peptides. This provides a valuable
ground for the discovery of new drugs that mimic the antimicrobial
activity or that possess in some cases anticancer, antiviral or antipar—
asitic functions (Fjell et al., 2012).

A growing number of naturally occurring AMPS are being dis—
covered thanks to huge research efforts. Additionally, synthetic new
peptides are being designed to understand, imitate or improve the
natural ones. For example, although one of the first published AMP
databases (Wang and Wang, 2004) comprised 523 peptides, mainly
from natural sources, a recent one (Zhao et al., 2013) holds 3904
natural and 1643 synthetic cases. Today there are many AMP data—
bases available, which depending on the origin of peptides can be
classified as ‘General’ or ‘Specific’ (Waghu et al., 2014). The
General databases comprise entries from a large variety of sources,
whereas the Specific ones are dedicated to store AMPs that come
from a particular type of organism, like bacteria, fungi or plants, or
belong to a particular family, like defensins or penaeidin. It is clear
that the General databases must share some identical sequences, at
least with the specialized ones. Similarly, there can be overlap be—
tween databases designed for different purposes due to the multiple
functions of AMPs.

Non—identical but similar sequences may likewise be found in
biological databases. Tolerating some redundancy of content can be
useful to derive a set of sequence—based physicochemical properties,
which would be essential for molecular functions (Torrent et al.,
2011). However, duplication and redundancy in a large collection
of biological data can also introduce distortions in the analysis of se—
quence—structure or sequence—property relationships or affect the ef—
ficiency in a similarity search. To avoid these problems, the
duplicate entries can be merged and closely similar sequences can be
clustered, thus yielding a representative set that covers the sequence
space. In this article, we aim to analyze the levels of overlap and di—
versity for the case of well—known AMP databases and to compile a
new non—redundant sequence database. To fulfill this purpose, we
have developed a software tool, which is also presented here.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Databases

There are 20 databases of AMPs freely available through the inter—
net. Next we describe them brieﬂy, in alphabetic order, mainly con—
sidering the sources of data and the particular purpose for their
creation. Some of them were disaggregated into sub—databases, giv—
ing the total of 25 databases used for this work (listed in Table 1).

AMSDb (Tossi and Sandri, 2002) contains eukaryotic sequences
produced by organisms ranging from fungi and protozoa to plants,
insects, fish, amphibians and mammals. It was derived principally
from the Swiss—Prot database.

AMPer (Fjell et al., 2007) is a database compiled from AMSDb
and UniProt. It encompasses all major AMP classes, including defen—
sins, cathelicidins and granulin among others. This database was
constructed to create hidden Markov models that enable recognition
of individual classes of antimicrobials peptides.

APD (Wang et al., 2009) provides peptides from all biological
sources. They were collected from the literature via PubMed
searches using keywords such as ‘antimicrobial peptide’, ‘antibacter—
ial peptide’, ‘antifungal peptide’, ‘anticancer peptide’ and ‘antitumor
peptide’.

AVde (Qureshi et al., 2014) contains AMPs that were experi—
mentally verified for antiviral activity, excluding those targeting
HIV because they were published in another database (see HIde in
this section). The data were extracted mainly from Patent Lens and
PubMed databases using text queries in the title/abstract fields, such
as (((((virus OR viral) AND (peptide OR peptides) AND (inhibit "'
OR block"'))))). The research articles returned by the above query
were manually reviewed and filtered. Besides, the modified peptides
were provided and, however, not considered in this study.

BACTIBASE (Hammami et al., 2010) is specifically dedicated to
Bacteriocins, which are AMPs produced by many bacteria and dis—
play growth—inhibition activity against other, closely related bac—
teria. All microbiological information was collected from the
literature via PubMed search.

Bagel (de Jong et al., 2010) is a web—based application that iden—
tifies the Open Reading Frames of putative bacteriocins, using
knowledge—based bacteriocin and motif databases. The internal
knowledge—based bacteriocin database was built from other data—
bases such as ExPasY, NCBI and UniProt. Additionally, as not all
known bacteriocins were present in these databases, a literature
search was used to incorporate missing cases. Bagel also assigns
each putative bacteriocin to a corresponding predicted Class. To ac—
complish this, the knowledge—based bacteriocin database has been
split according to a classification scheme in Classes I, II and III.
Class I contains three subclasses of lantibiotics according to Willey
and van Der Donk (2007). Class II is made of four subclasses of bac—
teriocins according to (Cotter et al., 2005) and Class III bacteriocins
are relatively large proteins.

CAMP (Waghu et al., 2014) contains sequences and structural
information of AMPs retrieved from protein databases such as
NCBI, UniProt and PDB, using combinations of keywords like ‘anti—
microbial’, ‘antibacterial’, ‘antifungal’, ‘antiviral’ and ‘antiparasitic’.
The data in CAMP are sectioned into sequence, structure and patent
databases. In turn, the sequence database is divided into two subda—
tabases, separating the experimentally validated peptides from the
predicted ones. In any case, the subdatabase of predicted sequences
has not been taken into account for this study.

DADP (Novkovic et al., 2012) includes only anuran defense
peptides obtained from research papers and UniProt. This database
focuses on precursors and their specific regions (signal, acidic and
bioactive). When the precursor structure is not reported, the peptide
is only presented as the mature bioactive sequence.

DAMPD (Sundararajan et al., 2012) is an update and a replace—
ment of the ANTIMIC database (Brahmachary et al., 2004). In this
case, the AMPs were retrieved from UniProt and subsequently cura—
ted manually by selecting only the experimentally validated
peptides.

DBAASP (Gogoladze et al., 2014) contains information on
AMPs of different origins (ribosomal, nonribosomal and synthetic)
and level of complexity (monomers, dimers and two peptides) that
have been collected from PubMed using the following keywords:
‘antimicrobial’, ‘antibacterial’, ‘antifungal’, ‘antiviral’, ‘antitumour’,
‘anticancer’ and ‘antiparasitic peptides’. A two—peptide complex dif—
fers from a dimer in that the former consists of two different poly—
peptide chains without an interchain covalent bond, which act
synergistically to yield a given antimicrobial activity, whereas the
latter involves a covalent link between the peptides. In this study,

only the polypeptide chains found as monomers were used, whereas
the dimer and two—peptide entries were ignored.

Defensins (Seebah et al., 2007) is focused on the defensin family
(Ganz, 2003) of AMPs. It includes sequences from mammals, birds,
invertebrates and plants. This information was gathered from biblio—
graphic databases as a primary source and from sequence databases
as a secondary source. For the primary source, a search query with
the keyword ‘defensin’ was performed in SciFinder Scholar 2006.
For the secondary source, UniProt and GenBank were used to collate
the amino acid sequences of individual defensin peptides.

HIde (Qureshi et al., 2013) provides experimentally verified
HIV inhibiting peptides. They were collected from the PubMed
database using the following search query ((((HIV) OR Human im—
munodeficiency virus)) AND ((peptide) OR peptides)) AND ((in—
hibit”) OR block"') in the title/abstract fields. The data so retrieved
were manually curated.

LAMP (Zhao et al., 2013) comprises natural and synthetic AMPs,
which have been partitioned into three databases: experimental, pre—
dicted and patent. All the AMP sequences were collected manually
from the scientific literature or from UniProt and other AMP—related
databases, for which cross—links have been established. As for the case
of CAMP, the predicted dataset was not included in this study.

MilkAMP (Theolier et al., 2014) is dedicated to the AMPs of
dairy origin that were found in PubMed and Google Scholar using a
combination of keywords such as ‘milk peptides’, ‘antimicrobial

peptides’ and common milk protein names, aliases and
abbreviations.

PenBase (Gueguen et al., 2006) has been developed to hold in—
formation about AMPs from the penaeid shrimp species. The data—
base was built by collecting and analyzing all publicly accessible
penaeidin sequence data.

Peptaibol (Whitmore and Wallace, 2004) was created to store
the sequences and structure information of a class of peptides
known as peptaibols (Chugh and Wallace, 2001). They are charac—
terized by the presence of an unusual amino acid, ot—aminoisobutyric
acid and a C—terminal hydroxylated amino acid. Generally, these
molecules have a fungal origin. To process the entries with the
BioJava library (Holland et al., 2008), the unusual amino acids in
the sequences were replaced by ‘X’.

PhytAMP (Hammami et al., 2009) is designated to store anti—
microbial plant peptides, which were collected from the UniProt
database and from the scientific literature using PubMed.

RAPD (Li and Chen, 2008) comprises data from the literature
by searching PubMed with the keywords ‘recombinant antimicro—
bial peptides’. This database facilitates extraction of relevant infor—
mation on recombinant approaches to produce AMPs.

YADAMP (Piotto et al., 2012) contains AMPs from all available
biological sources, ranging from bacteria and plants to animals,
including humans. The data have been collected from existing litera—
ture searches and other AMP databases.

UniProth (Magrane et al., 2011) acts as a central hub of pro—
tein knowledge by providing a unified view of protein sequence and
functional information. It consists of two sections, UniProtKB/
Swiss—Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL. UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot is
manually curated (reviewed by a curator), while the records in
UniProtKB/TrEMBL are generated automatically. In this study, we
used a subset of this database, gathered by the following query: (key—
word: ‘Antimicrobial [KW—0929]’ AND reviewed: yes).

2.2 Data collection and integration

Most of the available databases (Table 1) do not provide a single
link to download all entries. For those cases, we used the GNU
Wget software (http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) in a non—inter—
active way to obtain crude HTML pages of registries and to avoid
manual downloading of a large number of entries.

During the collection of data, we encountered errors for only 52
peptide sequences. In the case of AMSDb, 2 out of 895 entries were
rejected, one of them because of a broken link and the other due to
absence of sequence information. Empty sequences were also a cause
for rejection of 30 out of 566 registries of the Defensins database
and 20 out of 405 of the MilkAMP.

All retrieved HTML files were processed with the Community
Edition of Pentaho Data Integration, also known as Kettle (http://
community.pentaho.com/), which enables extraction, transform—
ation and loading of data (ETL process) to make it available for ana—
lysis, data mining or reporting. Kettle contains a number of tools
and utilities. The Spoon allows us to implement the ETL process by
the graphical construction of diagrams. The implemented diagrams
read the HTML files and clean up all malformed or faulty HTML to
convert it into eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML),
with the help of the jTidy Java API (http://jtidy.sourceforge.net/).
Finally, by querying the well—formed XHTML files with the XML
Path Language (XPath), the names and sequences of AMPs were
integrated into a single file with either the FASTA or Comma
Separated Value (CSV) format.

2.3 Analysis of the databases

The overlap and diversity across databases were calculated follow—
ing an approach by Voigt et al. (2001). The overlap of identical or
similar compounds found in two databases represents the percentage
of peptides in the first, for which identical or similar sequences exist
in the second. On the other hand, the diversity was estimated by
applying a clustering technique (Holm and Sander, 1998) and com—
puting the corresponding number of clusters divided by the total of
entries reported in the clustered database. Before determining the
overlap and diversity, the following elements were taken into ac—
count. First, all duplicate sequences were removed to form a set of
unique sequences for each database. Second, the pairwise sequence
identity, calculated as a ratio of identical residues between two
aligned peptides, above a given threshold, was used as a measure of
similarity. Third, the sequence alignments were calculated by the dy—
namic programming algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (1970),
implemented in BioJava with the Blosum 62 substitution matrix and
simple gap penalty parameters.

The clustering technique used to calculate the diversity and to
compile a non—redundant sequence database is as follows. First, the
list of peptides is sorted by the length of their sequences in a decreas—
ing order. Then, a set of cluster representatives is created and initial—
ized with the longest sequence of the sorted list. This set is
completed by aligning each remaining peptide in the sorted list with
all existing representatives and selecting as new representatives those

peptides with pairwise sequence identities smaller than a given
threshold value. At the end of this process, the cardinality of the rep—
resentative set is taken as the number of clusters, while the list of
representatives made a new non—redundant sequence database at the
given identity threshold.

3 Results and discussion

For the sake of a realistic analysis of overlap and diversity, we
removed all duplicate sequences from the databases. Table 1 lists the
total number of sequences as well as the number and ratio of unique
sequences for each database. The complete size, considering all data—
bases, is 35 064 registries. Of these, 16 990 entries are unique se—
quences, i.e. less than half (48.45%) of the total number of peptides
included in the databases.

There are only three databases without duplicate sequences:
LAMP_Patent, PenBase and YADAMP (Table 1). The databases
with highest duplication rates are Peptaibol and RAPD. In
Peptaibol, the ratio of non—duplicates in the original sequences is
89.24% (with 282 unique sequences). However, this ratio decreases
to 62.66% after replacement of the unusual amino acid residues by
a virtual X residue. This is because the remaining conventional
amino acids tend to be conserved in some specific positions, thus
causing the rise in the number of duplicate sequences. In the case of
RAPD, whose percentage of non—duplicates is 68.16%, the registries
with identical sequences differ mainly in the literature references
from which they were retrieved. Other low values of non—duplicate
sequences are 72.73% and 76.34%, for CAMP_Structure and
Bagel_III, respectively. In CAMP_Structure, the repeated sequences
correspond to peptides with more than one PDB code, and in
Bagel_III, they are identical sequences associated to more than one
source and organism. For the remaining databases, the non—identical
sequences are above 80% and in most cases, the repeated sequences
are due to slight differences in the corresponding entries.

3.1 Overlap analysis

An exhaustive study reveals the percentages of coincidences between
any pair of the collected databases (Fig. 1a). Considering an ascend—
ing order of overlap, this analysis shows that the Peptaibol database
does not present any sequence in common with the others. In the se—
cond place comes Bagel_III, whose large sequences are hardly incor—
porated in any other data source. For instance, only six records of
Bagel_III (8.45%) are present in Bactibase, one record (1.41%) is in
common with CAMP_Structure, three (4.23%) with DAMPD and
seven (9.86%) with UniProth. Other cases like AVde contain se—
quences in common with a greater number of databases but show
low percentage of overlap with most of them, reaching the highest
values with CAMP_Patent (4.13%) and LAMP_Patent (3.96%).
LAMP_Patent also displays low overlap levels, but this database is
included completely as a subset of CAMP_Patent. Another group of
uncommon sequences are stored in MilkAMP and HIde, but some
percentages of these sequences (18.53% and 34.27%, respectively)
are included in the most recent database DBAASP. The most promis—
cuous databases display the highest levels of overlap and, as ex—
pected, they are of the General type: APD, CAMP_Structure,
DAMPD, UniProth and YADAMP overlap with other 22
databases; CAMP_Validated and LAMP_Experimental overlap
with 21, whereas DBAASP overlaps with 20. With respect to
CAMP_Structure, we have classified it within the General type,
in spite of its specific purpose, because it holds the 3D structures
of entries from most other databases, excluding Petaibol and
Penbase.

Fig. 1. Two heatmaps to visualize the percentages of overlap between databases. The percentage values are substituted by colored cells according to the scales
given in the side bars, and they represent: (a) the fraction of the row database included in the column database and (b) the fraction of the row database stored ex-

clusively in a given number of databases

Figure 1b illustrates another extension of the overlap analysis
among databases. It consists of finding the peptide sequences shared
exclusively by n databases. For n = 1, we found that all databases,
except for LAMP_Patent, hold original sequences, i.e. not included
in any other database. The highest levels of uniqueness are for
Peptaibol (100%), AVde (92.52%), Bagel_III (80.28%) and
MilkAMP (79.23% ). For n = 2, we observed that LAMP_Patent and
CAMP_Patent share the largest number of exclusive peptides. For
n = 3, more than half of the peptides (57.14%) of Penbase are shared

uniquely with two other databases. Nevertheless, in general, the per—
centage of overlap decreases with the increase of the variable n.
Thus, there is only one sequence (KTCEHLAD TYRGVCFT NA
SCDDHC KNKAHLIS GTCHNWKC FCTQNC) included in 13
databases (n: 13). This corresponds to a defense—related peptide
found in pea seeds (Pisum sativum), which has antifungal activity
and is included in AMPer, AMSDb, APD, CAMP_Structure,
CAMP_Validated, DAMPD, DBAASP, Defensins, LAMP_
Experimental, PhytAMP, RAPD, UniProth and YADAMP. From a

global perspective, Table 2 lists the number of entries shared exclu—
sively by 71 (1—13) databases. Note that, despite the overlap between
databases, more than half of the entries in the complete dataset
(10512 out of 16 990) correspond to unique sequences deposited
only in their own database.

3.2 Diversity analysis

Figure 2 shows the diversity ratio (number of clusters/number of
entries) as a function of the identity threshold for each database and
the complete dataset. According to the steepness of the curves, the
databases may be categorized into three diversity groups: ‘top’,
‘middle’ and ‘bottom’. The top group (characterized by the steepest
slopes) comprised bacteriocins (Bagel_I, Bagel_II, Bagel_III,
Bactibase) and RAPD. Note, however, that for identity threshold
values greater than 0.5, the diversity ratio of Bagel_III decreases,
showing as a result a trend similar to databases categorized as of
middle diversity. As for the bottom diversity group, characterized by
low gradient slopes for identity threshold values below 0.90, this
contains Penbase, Peptaibol and DADP, where the low diversity is
probably due to the abundance of conserved regions in the families
of peptides in these particular databases.

Redundancy in the peptide databases is further evidenced by the
fact that the number of clusters is less than the number of entries
(number of clusters/number of entries < 1.0) for all identity thresh—
olds less than 1; i.e. there is an identical or nearly identical fragment
sequence shared by at least two entries (one cluster representative
and, as a minimum, one cluster member) for all similarity cutoff val—
ues. The number of clusters is only equal to the number of entries
(one entry per cluster) when the identity threshold is equal to 1, con—
sidering the exact match between sequences.

3.3 Software Dover Analyzer

To carry out most of the analysis described in this work, we have de—
veloped a software tool named Dover Analyzer. This software is a
new wizard—like application that takes the collection of AMP data—
bases as input and guides you through a few steps to compute the
overlap, diversity and the corresponding non—redundant sequence
databases (for table of the overlap, diversity ratio and sizes of the
representative sets in the complete dataset, see Supplementary
Information 512 and $13). Dover Analyzer is implemented in Java to
achieve platform independence, and it is distributed free of charge
along with a user manual. Although the set of AMP databases is
embedded into the application, in the first step of the wizard, the

user can keep or change the initial selection at will. In addition, new
databases can be added using files in FASTA format.

In the second step of the wizard, the user specifies an output dir—
ectory and a criterion for comparison. There are two criteria to com—
pare sequence entries in the AMP databases: (i) string comparison of
sequences or (ii) pairwise sequence identity above a given threshold.
If the first option is chosen, the identical overlap and non—redundant
sequence databases (without duplication) are computed. Upon
choosing the second option, one can compute the similarity overlap,
the diversity ratio and the non—redundant sequence databases (with—
out the neighbors of the cluster representatives). Additionally, the
user can choose the type of sequence alignment to be used
(Needleman—Wunsch or Smith—Waterman), the scoring matrix
(BLOSUM or PAM) and the sequence identity definition (number of
identical residues/number of columns or number of identical resi—
dues/length of shorter sequence). From the third step onwards, add—
itional settings which affect the output depending on the case study
may be configured.

The computations are launched in the last step of the wizard.
Most of the calculation time is spent on building the pairwise iden—
tity matrix, which stores the sequence identity between all pairs of
peptides (if this type of comparison was specified). For 71 sequences,
there are n >l< (n — 1) / 2 pairs of sequences that must be aligned. This
is a time—consuming task and a parallel implementation has been de—
veloped to take advantage of current multi—core processors. The par—
allelization strategy to construct the matrix is as follows: because
this matrix is symmetric, only the lower triangular part is used. This
part is divided into squared and triangular sections, which are in
turn subdivided until the portions of the big task are small enough
to be executed in parallel by the multi—core processors.

4 Conclusion and future work

This study assesses the overlap and diversity across 25 AMP data—
bases that have been created during the last decade. The overlap
analysis reveals three main facts: (i) all databases, except for
LAMP_Patent (which is included completely in CAMP_Patent),
have some percentage of uniqueness. (ii) All databases, except for
Peptaibol (which contains exclusive data), share some sequences
with at least one database, with the largest mutual overlap between

Overlap and diversity in AMP databases

the 13 databases being single peptide commonalities. (iii) Presently,
there is no general database that collects the universe of reported
AMP peptides. On the other hand, a comparison of the diversity
ratios of all databases has revealed that bacteriocins are the most di—
verse sequences. Conversely, the AMPs corresponding to anuran
species, peptaibol or penaeidin families are the least diverse.
Moreover, there is some degree of redundancy in each database. To
address this issue, we have developed a parallel—free software,
named Dover Analyzer, which allows easy calculation of the overlap
and diversity of any set of databases (existent, updated or new), as
well as building (from them) a new non—redundant sequence data—
base. This should allow potential users to compute their own repre—
sentative set of AMP peptides using reported sequences. In the
future, an integrated database and a search tool will be developed
and published. It will require a meticulous effort to reconcile data
from different sources, like the biological activity and other annota—
tions, which were not considered for this study.

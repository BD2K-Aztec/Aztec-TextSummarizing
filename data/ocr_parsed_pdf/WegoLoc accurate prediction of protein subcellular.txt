ABSTRACT

Summary: We present an accurate and fast web server, WegoLoc
for predicting subcellular localization of proteins based on sequence
similarity and weighted Gene Ontology (GO) information. A term
weighting method in the text categorization process is applied to
GO terms for a support vector machine classifier. As a result,
WegoLoc surpasses the state-of-the-art methods for previously
used test datasets. WegoLoc supports three eukaryotic kingdoms
(animals, fungi and plants) and provides human-specific analysis,
and covers several sets of cellular locations. In addition, WegoLoc
provides (i) multiple possible localizations of input protein(s) as well
as their corresponding probability scores, (ii) weights of GO terms
representing the contribution of each GO term in the prediction,
and (iii) a BLAST E-value for the best hit with G0 terms. If the
similarity score does not meet a given threshold, an amino acid
composition-based prediction is applied as a backup method.

The knowledge of protein subcellular localization (PSL)
provides primary information for protein functions and many
biotechnological applications (Glory and Murphy, 2007). As a
massive number of novel proteins have been sequenced, accurate
computational methods for PSL prediction have become essential
in many bioinformatics analyses. Such prediction methods may be
Classiﬁed into different categories according to the features of the
query sequences used. The most widely used methods are based
on the amino acid compositions and sorting signals (Emanuelsson
et (11., 2007; Hoglund et (11., 2006; Horton et (11., 2007; Nair and
Rost, 2005; Pierleoni et (11., 2006). Other powerful approaches
use textual information (Brady and Shatkay, 2008; Fyshe et (11.,
2008; Nair and Rost, 2002) or Gene Ontology (GO) annotations
for the input (or the most similar) proteins (Blum et (11., 2009;
Briesemeister et (11., 2009; Chi, 2010; Huang et (11., 2008; Lei and
Dai, 2006; Mei et (11., 2011; Shen and Chou, 2009).

In particular, GO-based methods have been among the best
predictors for PSL (Chi, 2010; Mei et (11., 2011). This may be
due to the strong correlation between GO annotations and PSL,

which implies that the GO annotations solely contain substantial
information for predicting PSL. Current GO-based methods use all
the GO terms as the information sources or select a small number of
informative GO terms (Huang et (11., 2008; Lei and Dai, 2006; Lu
and Hunter, 2005; Mei et (11., 201 1; Shen and Chou, 2009). However,
most of such methods assume that each GO term has an equal amount
of contribution in predicting PSL, which limits the discriminating
power of the methods.

To address the problem, a weighted GO algorithm (WGO) was
introduced by one of the authors (Chi, 2010): for a given set of
subcellular localizations, WGO calculates the log Chi-square statistic
for each GO term under the assumption of independence between
GO terms and localizations. The Chi-square statistic summarizes
the differences between the observed and expected frequencies of
proteins that share a GO term in each localization, and is used for
weighting the GO term. A large Chi-square value is assumed to
indicate a high discriminating power of the GO term. The collection
of the log Chi-square values serves as the feature vector for the
support vector machine (SVM) Classiﬁer, LIBSVM (Chang and Lin,
2001). See the paper by Chi (2010) for a detailed description of the
algorithm.

WGO outperformed most state-of—the-art methods on previously
used test datasets (Chi, 2010). In subsequent experiments, we
identiﬁed several key options whose combination enabled the

high performance of WGO method: (i) Classiﬁcation algorithms
(SVM versus KNN); (ii) annotation retrieving tools (GOA versus
InterProScan); and (iii) weighting GO terms (weighted versus
uniform weight). Each former option showed better accuracy.
Further explanations and detailed test results are available in the
Supplementary Material (Section 5). Selecting the former options
indicated above, we constructed a web server called WegoLoc that
implements the WGO algorithm (Chi, 2010).

Figure 1 describes the processing of an input sequence by
WegoLoc. When a query sequence is entered, it searches GO-
annotated proteins for the one with the highest sequence similarity
over a given threshold, and uses all the corresponding GO terms and
their weights to Classify the input sequence. If no such sequence is
found, the amino acid composition of the query sequence instead of
the GO weights is used as a feature vector for the SVM Classiﬁer. In
such cases, the GO terms and BLAST E-value are not available as
illustrated in the second result (No. 2) of the table in Fig. 2. WegoLoc

supports three eukaryotic kingdoms (animals, fungi and plants) and
in particular human for several sets of cellular locations.

Table 1 shows the performance of PSL predictors on several
test datasets. The ﬁrst one, the BaCelLo independent dataset (IDS)
(Casadio et (11., 2008) consists of proteins with <30% sequence
identity with those in the BaCelLo training dataset (Pierleoni et (11.,
2006). This dataset covers four localizations for animal and fungal
proteins and ﬁve localizations for plant proteins. The second, the
Hoglund IDS (Hoglund et (11., 2006) is collected in a way similar
to the BaCelLo’s. The training data in the Hoglund dataset covers 9
localizations for animal and fungal proteins and 10 localizations for
plant proteins. The last, the Human dataset (Shen and Chou, 2009)
covers 14 localizations. The performance of each PSL predictor is
measured by the average sensitivity (AVG) and the overall accuracy
(ACC). Let SE,- : Tl- /nl-, where 111- is the number of proteins and T1- is
the number of correctly predicted proteins at the localization 1', then
AVG =  SEi/C and ACC =  Ti/N, where C is the number

of subcellular locations used and N is the total number of proteins
in the test set.

As shown in Table 1, WegoLoc outperformed other methods
[MultiLoc2 (Blum et (11., 2009), BaCelLo (Pierleoni et (11., 2006),
WOLF PSORT (Horton et (11., 2007), SherLoc2 (Briesemeister et (11.,
2009), GO-TLM (Mei et (11., 2011) and Hum-mPLoc 2.0 (Shen
and Chou, 2009)] on each test dataset. Further explanations on the
datasets, performance criteria and prediction accuracies of WegoLoc
on each localization are available in the Supplementary Material
(Sections 1—4).

Comparing it with other tools, WegoLoc provides a wide
coverage on eukaryotic species, locations and test datasets (Table 1).
Moreover, it provides fast computation for predicting PSL. It takes 2
s per sequence on average, though the time may vary depending on
the network condition and the number of users, and will further be
speeded up by adopting the accelerated versions of the BLASTP
and GPUs (graphics processing units) (Vouzis and Sahinidis, 2011):
see Supplementary Fig. S1 for the current processing time of
WegoLoc. The input format for processing multiple sequences is
explained in the User’s guide from our web page. It allows up to
3000 sequences at a time in principle, but we recommend using
£500 sequences per each execution. Lastly, it provides detailed
information as shown in Fig. 2: (i) multiple possible localizations
as well as the corresponding probability scores if the multiplex
threshold is set below 1.0: localizations with a probability score
higher than [multiplex threshold >< highest probability score] will
also be assigned to the query protein; (ii) description and links for
GO terms and their weights; and (iii) the BLAST E-value for the
best hit with G0 terms. In addition to this web output, all the results
can be downloaded as a text ﬁle with a well-deﬁned format for
easy parsing. See Supplementary Material (Section 6) for detailed
explanations on the prediction results.

Overall, we constructed a highly accurate and fast predictor,
WegoLoc, for PSL by combining several key components for the
system including the WGO method (Chi, 2010). WegoLoc provides a
wide coverage on eukaryotic species and datasets as well as multiple
localizations of proteins for the query sequences. Currently, we only
provide related GO terms for describing the input protein, but plan
to extend the interpretation of our predictions e.g. implications for
disease (Park et (11., 2011).

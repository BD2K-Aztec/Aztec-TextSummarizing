Abstract

Motivation: The functional impact of small molecules is increasingly being assessed in different
eukaryotic species through large—scale phenotypic screening initiatives. Identifying the targets of
these molecules is crucial to mechanistically understand their function and uncover new therapeut—
ically relevant modes of action. However, despite extensive work carried out in model organisms
and human, it is still unclear to what extent one can use information obtained in one species to
make predictions in other species.

Results: Here, for the first time, we explore and validate at a large scale the use of protein hom—
ology relationships to predict the targets of small molecules across different species. Our results
show that exploiting target homology can significantly improve the predictions, especially for mol—
ecules experimentally tested in other species. Interestingly, when considering separately orthology
and paralogy relationships, we observe that mapping small molecule interactions among ortho—
logs improves prediction accuracy, while including paralogs does not improve and even some—
times worsens the prediction accuracy. Overall, our results provide a novel approach to integrate
chemical screening results across multiple species and highlight the promises and remaining chal—
lenges of using protein homology for small molecule target identification.

1 Introduction

Small molecules provide remarkable tools to modulate molecular
mechanisms in cells, with therapeutic applications in human and
veterinary, biotechnological or agricultural applications in many
other species from animals, to plants, to microorganisms. Small mol—
ecules displaying bioactivity in a given organism typically bind spe—
cific proteins and modify their activity. Mapping the actual protein
targets of small molecules is therefore a key step toward a better
understanding of their mechanisms of action. In addition, several
molecules bind to more than one target, which can be unrelated in
terms of both sequence and function (Karaman et (11., 2008; Mestres

et (11., 2009). These secondary targets are typically responsible for
many favorable or unfavorable side effects of known drugs.
Unraveling small molecule secondary targets is helpful to predict
and elucidate these side effects (Lounkine et (11., 2012; Young et (11.,
2008). Moreover, it is a promising approach to repurpose existing
drugs toward new applications by exploiting their activity on other
proteins than those they were initially developed for (Keiser et (11.,
2009).

Several experimental and computational strategies have been de—
veloped to determine the interacting partners and the activity of
small molecules (Ziegler et (11., 2013). Small molecules can be

screened in vitro against large arrays of proteins such as kinases or
G protein—coupled receptors (Davis et (11., 2011; Karaman et (11.,
2008). In parallel, in vivo screening approaches are increasingly
being developed using model organisms such as yeast (Giaever et (11.,
2004) or zebrafish (Zon and Peterson, 2005). Several of these che—
mogenomics screens use the power of genetics to provide indirect in—
formation about the actual targets of small molecules, for instance
by comparing the activity of small molecules across different mutant
strains in yeast (Lee et (11., 2014). From the computational point of
view, most target prediction approaches use similarity relationships
between a new molecule and known ligands (Dunkel et (11., 2008;
Gfeller et (11., 2014; Keiser et (11., 2007; Liu et (11., 2013). There top
predicted targets are identified as those with one or more ligands
that display high similarity with the query molecule. Different simi—
larity measures between molecules can be used for this purpose
(Armstrong et (11., 2011; Ballester and Richards, 2007; Gfeller et (11.,
2013; Rahman et (11., 2009; Willett, 2011). Other studies have
explored the use of additional information, such as side—effect simi—
larity (Campillos et (11., 2008) or gene expression profile similarity
(Iorio et (11., 2010) to expand the similarity beyond features deter—
mined solely by the molecular structure of the compounds. Other
groups have also used protein structures to predict small molecule
targets and potential binding modes (Gao et (11., 2008; Schomburg
et (11., 2014; Wang et (11., 2012a).

Computational target prediction tools are especially useful to
analyze the results of high—throughput phenotypic assays that are in—
creasingly being used to identify bioactive compounds in different
species but do not provide direct information about their targets
(Clemons, 2004; Inglese et (11., 2007). Data from thousands of such
assays are available in public repositories such as ChemBank
(Seiler et (11., 2008) or PubChem (Wang et (11., 2012b). In silica tar—
get predictions have been successfully applied to the results of
phenotypic screening assays performed in diverse systems ranging
from cell lines (Young et (11., 2008) to zebrafish (Laggner et (11.,
2012).

Unfortunately, most current experimental and computational
approaches to determine small molecule targets focus on one species
such as human, mouse or rat. As such, information about protein
orthology relationships to make predictions in less—studied species
or improve predictions in model organisms by integrating data from
other species has been mostly disregarded. For instance, only a
handful of recent studies investigated the properties of ligands bind—
ing to related proteins in distinct organisms (Klabunde, 2007;
Kruger and Overington, 2012; Paricharak et (11., 2013) or within the
same organism (Schuffenhauer et (11., 2003). This is in stark contrast
with many areas of biology and bioinformatics where the ability to
transfer results obtained in one organism to others is a central
dogma. For instance, mapping protein function based on orthology
has proved extremely useful (Loewenstein et (11., 2009). Protein
structure predictions rely heavily on the existence of homologous
proteins with available crystal structures (Kiefer et (11., 2009).
Protein—protein interaction predictions also strongly benefit from in—
formation obtained in orthologous species (Matthews et (11., 2001).
All these studies have clearly established the use of homology rela—
tionships to better predict the properties of proteins.

This lack in conceptual understanding and computational tech—
niques to exploit target homology in small molecule—protein inter—
action predictions is strongly limiting the scope of chemoinformatics
approaches for two main reasons. First, beyond model organisms
such as human or rat, very few data are available in public databases
for other organisms (e.g. zebrafish and bacteria) and accurate
predictions would be very useful in these species. Second, it would

be highly desirable to integrate data obtained in close orthologous
species to improve existing techniques predicting small molecule—
protein interactions, even in well—studied organisms. Understanding
how small molecule targets can be mapped across species is also crit—
ically important for therapeutic applications since small molecules
of therapeutic interest are first tested in model organisms (e.g. mouse
or rat) before being considered for clinical trials in human.

Here, we introduce a new strategy to integrate data from differ—
ent species to improve small molecule—target predictions. Our results
reveal that protein orthology leads to improve prediction accuracy
and is powerful to uncover new small molecule—protein interactions,
especially in species with less experimental data. Interestingly,
paralogy relationships do not appear to improve prediction
accuracy. Finally, our findings provide a strong basis for expanding
small molecule—protein target predictions beyond well—studied
organisms.

2 Methods

2.1 Small molecule activity data

Small molecule interactions with protein targets were retrieved from
the ChEMBL database (Bento et (11., 2014), including only molecules
with more than 5 and less than 60 heavy atoms. Interactions are se—
lected as activity relationships between a small molecule and a single
protein annotated as binding (‘B’) in ChEMBL with activity (e.g. Ki,
Kd, Km, IC50 or EC50) lower than 10 (AM in all assays. In each spe—
cies, our dataset consists of small molecules with reported activity in
ChEMBL18 but absent from ChEMBL16, which is the reference
database behind the SwissTargetPrediction method to predict the
targets of small molecules. The list of interactions is available at
httpz//www.swisstargetprediction.ch/download.php. Molecular
scaffolds were determined using the OPREA definition (Pollock
et (11., 2008).

2.2 Homology relationships

Four species were considered in this work: human, rat, mouse and
cow. The selection was made based on the amount of data present
in ChEMBL, requiring especially to have at least 100 different tar—
gets with reported ligands to meaningfully evaluate prediction ac—
curacy. Orthology and paralogy relationships were retrieved from
Ensembl Compara (Vilella et (11., 2009), Treefam (Schreiber et (11.,
2014) and orthoDB (Waterhouse et (11., 2013) databases, consider—
ing the union of all three databases and allowing both one—to—one
and one—to—many relationships. Including homology relationships
results in a much higher number of potential targets (Fig. 2B), espe—
cially in rat, mouse and cow. This is because many human targets
have orthologs that have no reported ligand in those species.
Therefore, considering target homology between these species and
human significantly increases the number of potential targets.
Homology relationships are available at http://www.swisstargetpre
diction.ch/download.php.

2.3 Target predictions

Target prediction was carried out by comparing new molecules pre—
sent only in the recent release of ChEMBL (ChEMBL1 8) with
known ligands in the SwissTargetPrediction database (referred to as
‘reference dataset’), which is derived from ChEMBL16 (Gfeller
et (11., 2014). The method is similar to the one described in our previ—
ous work (Gfeller et (11., 2013, 2014). In this approach, two kinds of
similarity values based on chemical similarity [FP2 Fingerprints
(Willett, 2011)] and shape similarity [Electroshape (Armstrong

et (11., 2011)] are combined using logistic regression. More precisely,
the similarity between each ligand of a target and the query molecule
is computed for both similarity measures. The most similar ligand
for each kind of similarity measure is used to compute the final score
between a ligand and a target. To combine the two similarity values,
the logistic regression model that had been trained with the refer—
ence dataset derived from ChEMBL16 (Gfeller et (11., 2013) has been
used here. For this training procedure, the total number of interact—
ing ligand—target pairs was 347889, and the number of negative
data (non—interacting pairs) was five times larger than positive data
[see Gfeller et al. (2013) for other details]. The final logistic regres—
sion scores between a query molecule and their potential targets
range between 0 for a mismatch and 1 for a perfect match and can
be used to rank the targets and identify the top predicted ones (see
below).

Predictions using target homology where implemented as follows
(see example in Fig. 1). The query molecule is compared to all lig—
ands in each species. Similarity values with ligands targeting hom—
ologous proteins are then mapped by homology to proteins in the
species were predictions are made. When testing the inﬂuence of
orthology relationships, especially interesting molecules are those
present in our reference dataset in one of the other organisms con—
sidered in this work (see example in Fig. 1C). Such molecules are ex—
pected to benefit most from orthology—based predictions, since their
targets can be directly mapped across species. Prediction accuracy
was therefore computed separately for this subset of molecules
(Figs 3B, 4B and 4D).

Including target orthology results in significantly more targets
that can be predicted, many of which have not been tested (Table 1 ).
For this reason, we also consider predictions that are restricted to
targets that are present in our reference set built from ChEMBL

tein in our reference dataset (Boumendjel et al., 2002)

2.4 Performance evaluation

We used two metrics to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.
First, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated for each
molecule in our datasets (i.e. ligands tested in ChEMBL18 but not in
ChEMBL16). Negative data were retrieved as interactions with
activity higher than 100 (AM in all assays. These data were supple—
mented with randomly selected targets to have five times more nega—
tive than positive data for each molecule in our dataset (Gfeller
et (11., 2013). AUC values were then averaged over the whole dataset
in each species. AUC values provide an unbiased global estimate of
the prediction accuracy over the entire range of potential targets.
However, for practical applications, one is often interested in top—
ranking predictions that can typically be tested experimentally. We
therefore also used the fraction of ligands in each species with at
least one reported target among the top 15 predicted proteins. It is
important to note that the number of potential targets is always
much larger than 15. Therefore, the probability to obtain a correct
target simply by chance is much lower than the numbers reported in
Figure 4. However, as noted in the main text, including homology
relationships significantly increases the number of targets, which
can contribute to the lower values obtained in Figure 4A compared
with Figure 4C.

3 Results

The workﬂow of our method is illustrated on Figure 1A. As in other
ligand—based approaches, it relies on the observation that similar
bioactive compounds tend to have similar targets. In this frame—
work, the predicted targets for a query molecule are those interact—
ing with ligands displaying the highest similarity with this molecule.
To integrate target homology, a small molecule with reported bio—
activity in a given species S is compared with all known ligands of
proteins from other organisms that have at least one homolog in S.
Predicted targets are determined as those with homologous proteins
binding to the most similar ligands in other species. In the absence
of small molecule—protein interaction data in S, predictions rely only
on target orthology. Alternatively, if some ligands are reported in S,
ligands of homologous proteins are added to the list of similar mol—
ecules. When considering paralogy relationships, potential predicted
targets are proteins from S either with known ligands or having a
paralog in S with known ligands similar to the query molecule (see
example in Fig. 1A). An example of a successful prediction in human
using similarity with a ligand binding to a mouse orthologous
protein is shown in Figure 1B.

A special situation arises when a query molecule has been al—
ready tested in another organism (Fig. 1C). In this case, the most

similar ligand will be the molecule itself and the top predicted tar—
gets will be the orthologs of the targets in the species where the mol—
ecule has been tested.

To explore the use of homology—based target predictions, we used
the SwissTargetPrediction method to assess similarity between mol—
ecules and predict their targets (Gfeller et (11., 2013, 2014). This algo—
rithm was built using the ChEMBL database version 16 as a reference
dataset of small molecule—protein interactions (Bento et (11., 2014) and
includes data from human, mouse, rat, cow and horse. Since horse
has only three targets with reported ligands, it was not included in this
work. Thus, homology—based predictions were tested considering four
different organisms: human, rat, mouse and cow. To test the use of
homology relationships, we used for each organism separately all
compounds in ChEMBL18 that do not appear in our reference dataset
derived from ChEMBL16 (see Section 2 for more details). The total
number of small molecules in this dataset is displayed in Figure 2A
(gray bars). For each species, the number of molecules that were tested
in ChEMBL16 in one of the three other organisms is shown in black
bars in Figure 2A. Apart from cow, most compounds of our dataset
are not found in ChEMBL16 in any of the four organisms.

Predictions were carried out as described in Figure 1 in each or—
ganism, considering no homology, orthology, paralogy and both
orthology and paralogy relationships. It is important to note that
including homology, and especially orthology relationships increases
significantly the number of potential targets available for prediction
for rat, mouse and cow, as observed in Figure 2B (green bars). This
is because the number of targets on which ligands have been tested
in these species is much smaller than in human. Therefore, including
orthology—based predictions with orthologous human targets ex—
pands significantly the number of potential predictable targets. In
human, the number of proteins without ligands in our reference
dataset but with orthologs in mouse, rat or cow that have known
ligands is much smaller. Therefore, including orthology relation—
ships does not increase much the total number of targets available
for predictions in human. Paralogy relationships provide on average
a 30—40% increase in the number of potential predictable targets
(Fig. 2B, orange bars).

For each molecule in our dataset, the performance was assessed
using AUC, as well as the fraction of ligands with at least one correct
target among the top 15 predictions (see Section 2). In terms of AUC
values, Figure 3A indicates that including orthology relationships
between targets leads on average to better AUC, especially for rat,
mouse and cow. Interestingly, we observe that the use of paralogy
relationships in general does not result in better AUC values and
most often give rise to lower values. Considering both target orthol—
ogy and paralogy gives similar performance as when only target
orthology is used.

As noted in previous studies, small molecule—protein interaction
data display strong biases and redundancies in part because of the

systematic exploration of sidechain replacements that preserve the
compounds’ scaffold in medicinal chemistry experiments. This
makes target prediction much easier for molecules belonging to
chemical series intensively explored. As a consequence, the AUC
value calculated from the entire dataset does not reﬂect the predict—
ive ability of the approach for molecules belonging to new chemical
series (Gfeller et (11., 2013; Rohrer and Baumann, 2008). One way
of addressing this issue consists in preventing comparisons between
ligands with the same scaffold (see Section 2) (Gfeller et (11., 2013).
As expected, AUC values are lower when preventing comparison be—
tween the same scaffolds, but the same trend is visible
(Supplementary Fig. S1A).

We further investigate the situation where molecules in our data—
set have been previously tested in another species (Fig. 1C). This cor—
responds to the case where target orthology relationships are
expected to be most beneficial. We observe that AUC values are
higher and, as before, target orthology leads to improved AUC val—
ues, while paralogy relationships result in few changes (Fig. 3B). The
same results hold when preventing comparisons between ligands
with the same scaffolds (Supplementary Fig. S1B).

AUC values provide an unbiased measure of prediction accuracy.
However, for practical purposes, only the top predicted targets are
typically tested experimentally. We therefore consider a second
measure of performance defined as the fraction of ligands for which
at least one of the top 15 predicted targets is a known one (i.e. true
positive) in our dataset. This can be seen as the probability of having
at least one hit when experimentally testing top predicted targets,
which is most useful to guide experimental approaches. In the gen—
eral case, although orthology relationships gave better AUC values,
we observe that the likelihood of obtaining a correct hit among the
top predicted targets decreases for rat, mouse and cow and is only
very slightly higher in human when considering orthology—based
predictions (Fig. 4A). Target paralogy also results in lower perform—
ance. However, if we only consider molecules that have been tested
in other species (Fig. 4B), the fraction of query molecules with at
least one known target in the top 15 is higher for human, rat and
mouse when using protein orthology relationships. This result con—
firms that target orthology relationships are especially useful to map
the targets of molecules that have been directly tested in another
organisms.

of compounds with at least one known target among the top

predicted ones can be understood by observing that the number of
potential predictable targets is much larger when orthology—based
mapping is allowed (Fig. 2B and Table 1, last column), suggesting
that for many new targets that can be predicted by homology, no lig—
and has simply been tested experimentally. Moreover, most of the
targets in our dataset are already present in previous assays even
without considering target homology (Table 1, column 3). To ex—
plore the effect of this potential bias, we restricted the predictions to
targets that are present in our reference dataset. Remarkably, in this
case, we see a constant improvement when including orthology rela—
tionships for all four organisms (Fig. 4C and D, green versus gray
bars). The same results hold when considering the sensitivity (see
Supplementary Fig. S2). This suggests that the lower performance of
orthology—based predictions observed in Figure 4A also comes from
the much larger number of targets that are available for predictions
when considering orthology relationships. Because for many of these
‘new’ targets no ligand has been tested, a larger number of data
annotated as negative are present in our dataset, which is known to
affect measures considering the top predictions, such as the one used
in Figure 4. Overall, these results suggest that orthology—based pre—
dictions work especially well for compounds tested in some other or—
ganism. In our benchmarks, we further observe that ligands of ‘old’
targets can be predicted using target orthology. For the other pre—
dicted protein targets, it is important to realize that many of them
have not been considered in experimental assays. Therefore, some of
the orthology—based predictions may be correct but do not appear as
true positives in our dataset because of the lack of experimental data
for these targets.

To explore the potential of the proposed framework in other
species, we display in Figure 5 the number of targets available for
predictions in a wide range of organisms. As expected, this number
is lower for invertebrates, since there exist less orthologs in these
species. Nevertheless, a significant number of proteins can still be
accessed by orthology in these distant species. We also note that the
higher number of targets in zebrafish compared with other verte—
brates likely arises because of the whole genome duplication event in
teleosts (Howe et (11., 2013; Taylor et (11., 2001). Most importantly,
Figure 5 indicates that orthology—based predictions have the poten—
tial to significantly impact small molecule—target discovery well be—
yond the four species considered in this work.

actions between proteins and small molecule ligands. Here, we ob—
serve that target prediction accuracy is improved, both in terms of
AUC and of the fraction of molecules with at least one correct target
among the top predicted ones, when including data from other organ—
isms in all four species analyzed in this work. This is especially striking
when the query molecule has been already tested in some other spe—
cies, which corresponds to the most straightforward way of mapping
small molecule—protein interactions across species (Fig. 1C).

The much larger number of potential targets that can be pre—
dicted using orthology (Fig. 2B and Table 1) can sometimes result in
lower number of correct predictions among the top 15 predicted tar—
gets (Fig. 4A). However, when including only targets on which lig—
ands have been tested in previous assays (here in version 16 of
ChEMBL), we observe that target orthology relationships lead to a
clear improvement, especially in rat, mouse and cow (Fig. 4C and
D). This is likely because targets used in older assays are often
reused in new ones, as observed in Table 1. First many of these ‘old’
targets have been selected based on their therapeutic or biotechnolo—
gical interest and therefore are more likely to be studied. Second,
when planning new experiments, researchers are typically guided by
previous successful studies and therefore tend to preferentially study
targets with already known ligands. Last, and possibly most import—
antly, ‘old’ targets often have well—established experimental assays,
possibly commercially available, that are more likely to be reused by
experimentalists, rather than setting up a whole new assay for new
targets. For these reasons, it is not surprising that orthology—based
predictions resulting in many more potential targets give lower per—
formance in terms of the fraction of ligands with validated targets
among the top predictions (Fig. 4A and B). However, when correct—
ing for the bias toward reusing the same targets in experimental
studies, we see a clear improvement in the predictions (Fig. 4C and
D). Based on the improved accuracy when considering only ‘old’ tar—
gets, it is tempting to speculate that many of the orthology—based
predictions for new targets, especially in rat, mouse and cow, may
actually be correct, but simply have not been tested.

We observed that mapping small molecule targets between paral—
ogs is often detrimental to the predictions. This likely reﬂects several
factors. First, evolutionary studies indicate that paralogs have
diverged more than orthologs. As a consequence, protein function is
often more conserved among orthologs than paralogs (Altenhoff
et (11., 2012). In terms of protein—ligand interactions, previous work
also suggested that orthologous proteins share more of their ligands

compared with paralogs (Kruger and Overington, 2012). Second,
small molecules are often designed to target only some specific mem—
bers of a protein family (e.g. specific kinase inhibitors). Therefore,
mapping their interactions within a family of paralogs may often
lead to false positives. Although some of these results might have
been guessed, our work demonstrates for the first time that paralogy
relationships are in general not appropriate for transferring small
molecule—target interactions within an organism.

To validate and compare predictions with and without orthology
relationships, we used AUC and the fraction of ligands with at least
one correct target among the top 15 predictions. This strategy does
not require fixing an arbitrary threshold on the target scores, which
may not be the same for all ligands, and takes a more pragmatic ap—
proach (correct prediction among the top predicted targets), which
corresponds to what can be reasonably tested experimentally. Other
studies have used measures such as sensitivity and specificity assum—
ing a fixed and uniform threshold to separate interacting from non—
interacting pairs (Liu et al., 2013).

A natural question is whether orthology—based predictions will
be as successful in more distant species, such as those displayed in
Figure 5. Unfortunately, much less data are available in most species
apart from human, rat, mouse and cow. For instance, horse, zebra—
fish or worm have less than five targets each with reported binding
data in ChEMBL. When attempting to check the predictions in these
species with little interaction data, we could not find significant val—
idations of the predictions. However, because of the sparsity of
data, we expect that this observation may not truly reﬂect the real—
ity. In particular, orthology—based target predictions are likely to be
useful in species like zebrafish, as attested by many biological studies
that map small molecule activity across vertebrate species (Gebruers
et al., 2013; Ridges et al., 2012).

Our work is the first attempt to establish the use of protein hom—
ology for bioactive small molecule target predictions at a large scale.
Overall, we observe that clear improvement can be achieved by
using target orthology, whereas paralogy relationships do not result
in significantly better predictions. In this work, we used our previ—
ously published method (Gfeller et al., 2013) to determine ligand
similarity and ligand—target interaction scores. However, the idea of
integrating orthology relationships into target predictions can be
easily generalized to other small molecule similarity metrics. Our
analysis also reveals a strong bias in recent small molecule—protein
interaction datasets where the same targets are used over and over.
This aspect should be considered when benchmarking cross—species
target prediction approaches. Although there are many practical rea—
sons for this bias, this work could serve as a guide to develop new
assays to test potentially interesting targets in different species.
These would increase our sampling of the ligand space for many
proteins, which could then further improve the in silico predictions
from model organisms to humans. Homology—based predictions can
be tested at our website: http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch.

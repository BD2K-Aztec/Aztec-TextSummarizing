ABSTRACT

Summary: lnversions are a common form of structural variation,
which may have a marked effect on the genome and methods to infer
quantities of interest such as those relating to population structure
and natural selection. However, due to the challenge in detecting
inversions, little is presently known about their impact. Software to
simulate inversions could be used to provide a better understanding
of how to detect and account for them; but while there are several
software packages for simulating population genetic data, none
incorporate inversion polymorphisms. Here, we describe a software
package, modified from the forward-in-time simulator FREGENE,
which simulates the evolution of an inversion polymorphism, of
specified length, location, frequency and age, in a population
of sequences. We describe previously unreported signatures of
inversions in SNP data observed in invertFREGENE results and a
known inversion in humans.

1 INTRODUCTION

An inversion mutation both reorientates and ﬂips over the strands
of a stretch of DNA sequence. Recombinations are typically only
viable between sequences in the same orientation, leading to the
separate evolution of inverted and non-inverted sequences at the
locus (Navarro et (11., 2000). While sequencing may distinguish
inverted and non-inverted sequences directly, genotyping cannot
because: (i) unlike copy number variants, the allele intensity is
unaltered, and (ii) the alleles on the inverted sequence are mapped
to their location on the reference genome rather than their actual
location. However, their effect on recombination may leave a
discernible pattern on local linkage disequilibrium (LD).

While most research on inversion polymorphisms has been
performed in Drosophila, recent analyses of sequence (Kidd et (11.,
2008) and SNP data (Bansal et (11., 2007) indicate that inversions are
a common form of structural variation in the human genome. Studies
have shown that inversions may effect genome-wide recombination
rates and be associated with natural selection and disease (Antonaccil

et al., 2007; Sharp et (11., 2006, 2007). There has also been concern
that inversions may bias statistical methods for inferring quantities
of interest such as those relating to population structure and recent
selection (Deng et (11., 2008; Price et (11., 2008). Therefore, statistical
methods have been developed to detect inversion polymorphisms
from population SNP data (Bansal et (11., 2007; Sindi and Raphael,
2009), and methods for inferring population genetic parameters may
need revising to account for their presence.

However, to test methods for detecting inversions and assess
the robustness of population genetic methods to the presence
of inversions, software to simulate genetic data incorporating
inversions is required. To our knowledge, the only strategy adopted
to simulate data with inversions consists of reorientating a proportion
of sequences at a locus in the HapMap data (Bansal et (11.,
2007; Sindi and Raphael, 2009). While this strategy is simple
and should produce data that reﬂects some features of inversion
loci, reorientating contemporary genetic data does not model the
evolution of the inversion through time. In particular, the suppression
of recombination between inverted and non-inverted sequences,
which results in their subsequent independent segregation, is not
modelled but has speciﬁc effects on the data (Section 3).

FREGENE is a software package that simulates population
sequence data forwards through time by simulating every meiotic
and mutation event in a population of sequences over a ﬁxed
number of generations (Chadeau-Hyam et (11., 2008; Hoggart et (11.,
2007). By simulating data forward-in-time, FREGENE allows
complex scenarios of demography and recombination to be modelled
simultaneously. This enables the generation of data Closely matching
the features of data from the major genotyping projects (Chadeau-
Hyam et (11., 2008). Here we modify the software to produce
an afﬁliated program, invertFREGENE. This is the ﬁrst software
package to simulate genetic data with inversions and exploits the
forward-in-time approach to model the fundamental features of an
inversion as it segregates.

2 DESCRIPTION

invertFREGENE simulates genetic data in the same way as
FREGENE, but can also simulate a single inversion polymorphism
of a speciﬁed length, location, population frequency and age.
Before simulating an inversion, invertFREGENE should be used to
simulate an initial population, without an inversion, to equilibrium.
A simulation of 10N generations (N =p0pulati0n size) should be
adequate, ensuring that 98% of sites have a unique common
ancestor (Hoggart et (11., 2007). We use the recombination model
developed by (Schaffner et (11., 2005) to simulate the broad
and ﬁne-scale recombination variation observed in humans and

Simulating inversions

 

apply genome-wide average mutation and recombination rates, so
that at equilibrium the homozygosity levels, LD structure and
allele frequency distribution reﬂect those observed in humans.
invertFREGENE simulates under neutrality, applying a uniform
rate ﬁnite-site mutation model and can model subpopulations
with migration rates speciﬁc to each pair of subpopulations and
instantaneous population expansions and contractions.

In the ﬁrst generation of an inversion simulation, one sequence
is subject to an inversion mutation from which all subsequent
inversions derive. Each ‘sequence’ is stored as a vector of nucleotide
locations where the mutant allele is present. An inversion mutation
is modelled by inverting the locations of mutants in a section of one
vector. If the inversion mutation is between the 100th and 200th base
on a sequence with mutant alleles at locations 105, 148 and 185,
then the inverted sequence has mutants at locations 115, 152 and
195. In the simulation of subsequent generations, recombinations
proposed within the inversion between inverted and non-inverted
sequences are rejected and new recombination locations are
proposed. Recombinations proposed between sequences in the same
orientation occur as usual. This will result in the correct partioning of
DNA sequence after recombination between two inverted sequences
because the location of SNPs within the inverted sequence has been
ﬂipped.

If the inverted sequences are lost from the population then a
new inversion mutation occurs in the next generation. Simulations
in which the inversion frequency exceeds a user-deﬁned threshold
(default 10%) but are then lost without reaching the speciﬁed target
frequency or age, are restarted with a new seed and the initial input
population. Setting a low threshold ensures that the ﬁnal data are
not affected by previous common inversions. The user can set either
or both of the frequency and age of the inversion, speciﬁcally the
minimum and maximum age of the inversion in generations, since
both parameters are likely to contribute to the Characteristics of the
resulting data. The simulation stops at the ﬁrst generation where
these criteria are met, and is restarted if the target frequency is not
reached before the maximum age of the inversion.

The data can be output to reﬂect either genotyped data, produced
by reorientating all inverted sequences to their original position
(mimicking mapping to a reference genome), or sequenced data,
where the data is output directly.

3 RESULTS

Using invertFREGENE we simulated a 500 kb inversion at the centre
of a 2 Mb region, with a target inverted sequence frequency of
40%. Figure 1a displays a plot of minor allele frequency (MAF) by
physical position for the simulated region. The inversion is spanned
by a set of SNPs with MAF Close to 40%, forming a visible line at the
inversion locus. This feature occurs because mutant alleles present
on the original inverted sequence, that were otherwise absent or very
rare in the population, should be present in every subsequent inverted
sequence but not in non-inverted sequences because there are no
recombinations between sequences in opposing orientation. These
alleles therefore tag the inversion and have population frequency
equal to that of the inversion. The corresponding SNPs are perfectly
correlated with each other. The well-established inversion at the
MAPT locus on Chromosome 17 (Kidd et (11., 2008; Stefansson et (11.,
2005) has an estimated frequency of 20% in Europeans (Stefansson
et (11., 2005). Figure 1b displays the MAF plot at this locus for

European HapMap individuals. As expected, a line of SNPs at
frequency 20% resides within the inversion locus. There is a gap in
the genotyped SNPs at the right breakpoint, possibly due to repeat
sequence. If such gaps are found to be common at inversion loci
then they should be modelled in simulated data by removing SNPs
Close to breakpoints.

Supplementary Figures 1 and 2 show the pairwise LD (Barrett
et (11., 2005) between SNPs from the invertFREGENE simulation
described above. The LD block at the centre of the region
corresponds to the inversion locus, which occurs because of the
fewer recombinations within the inversion and the set of perfectly
correlated SNPs (r2 = 1) tagging the inversion. The breakdown of
LD Close to the inversion breakpoints is a consequence of the ﬂipped
SNP positions in the inverted sequences. Although the recorded
separation between SNPs on either side of the breakpoints is small,
the actual distance in the inverted sequences is large. A particular
feature of the LD block reﬂecting the presence of an inversion is that
while there are many pairs of SNPs in perfect correlation, generally
indicative of a paucity of recombination, there are also many pairs of
SNPs with D’ < 1, due to recombination events at the locus between
sequences in the same orientation. Supplementary Figures 3 and 4
show LD plots for the region of the MAPT inversion locus in the
HapMap data of Figure 1b. Again, an LD block corresponds to the
inversion locus, within which there are many perfectly correlated
SNPs but also pairs of SNPs with D’ < 1.

We have shown that invertFREGENE produces some of the
ﬁlndamental features expected of an inversion locus, namely that
perfectly correlated SNPs span the inversion and that, despite this,
D’ is often below 1. We have also shown that these features are
observed in data from a known inversion in the human genome. The
previous strategy of simulating inversions by ﬂipping contemporary
sequences would not produce these features, and therefore analyses
based on data simulated in this way may be inaccurate. This
highlights the necessity for a software tool that accurately models
inversion polymorphisms.

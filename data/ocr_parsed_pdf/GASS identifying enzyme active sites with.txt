Abstract

Motivation: Currently, 25% of proteins annotated in Pfam have their function unknown. One way of
predicting proteins function is by looking at their active site, which has two main parts: the catalytic
site and the substrate binding site. The active site is more conserved than the other residues of the
protein and can be a rich source of information for protein function prediction. This article presents
a new heuristic method, named genetic active site search (GASS), which searches for given active
site 3D templates in unknown proteins. The method can perform non—exact amino acid matches
(conservative mutations), is able to find amino acids in different chains and does not impose any
restrictions on the active site size.

Results: GASS results were compared with those catalogued in the catalytic site atlas (CSA) in four
different datasets and compared with two other methods: amino acid pattern search for substruc—
tures and motif and catalytic site identification. The results show GASS can correctly identify >90%
of the templates searched. Experiments were also run using data from the substrate binding sites
prediction competition CASP 10, and GASS is ranked fourth among the 18 methods considered.

1 Introduction

 

Over 14 000 protein families are currently annotated in Pfam (http://
pfam.sanger.ac.uk/), from which more than 3500 still have their
functions unknown (Finn et (11., 2014). Experimental tests are ex—
pensive and time consuming, and, in their absence, studies have
shown that protein function can be successfully inferred based on
the sequence or structure similarity between the hypothetical protein
and proteins of known function (Zvelebil and Baum, 2008).

One way of predicting protein function is by searching for en—
zyme binding sites. According to Marhaman and Thornton (2008),
enzyme binding sites are regions on the surface of an enzyme spe—
cially modelled to interact with other molecules. There are different
types of binding sites, the most important being the active site.

The active site is divided into two or three parts, which include the
catalytic site and the substrate binding site. The former is usually a
set of two to six residues that perform the catalytic reaction while
the latter recognizes the molecule upon which the enzyme acts.
For the sake of simplicity, as finding a binding, active or catalytic
site refers to the same computational problem, this article always
refers to active sites, which is a broader term and encompasses both
catalytic and substrate binding sites.

Due to their importance to enzyme function, active sites amino
acids are more conserved during evolution than the sequence as a
whole. Consequently, they can be a rich source of information
for function prediction (FN; Cassarino et (11., 2014; Torrance
and Thornton, 2009). Several methods have been proposed to infer

protein function based on active site similarity (Jacobson et (11.,
2014), and they can be grouped into three major categories: se—
quence—based, structure—based and hybrid. When using sequence,
multiple alignments of various organisms have been widely used
to verify conservation of residues that may be structurally or func—
tionally important, including Henschel et al. (2007), Goldenberg
et al. (2009), Torrance and Thornton (2009) and Lopez et al.
(2011). Structure—based methods developed with the same purpose
can be found in Wallace et al. (1997), Barker and Thornton (2003),
Kristensen et al. (2008) and Brylinski and Skolnick (2008). Hybrid
methods, in contrast, take advantage of different types of informa—
tion, including surface accessibility (Huang and Schroeder, 2006),
physiochemical properties (Andersson et (11., 2010) or homology
modelling (Wass et (11., 2010).

This article is particularly interested in methods for searching
active sites based on structural data. In general, structure—based
methods proposed to identify active sites in proteins are based on
graphs, where nodes represent atoms in the amino acid side chain
and neighbour atoms are connected with edges, weighted by their
distances. In this context, Stark and Russell (2003) proposed a
simple graph—search method based on a depth—first search called
patterns in non—homologous tertiary structures, which finds all pos—
sible residue patterns (considering all template atoms) common to
the template of the target protein.

Nadzirin et a1. (2012), in contrast, proposed amino acid pattern
search for substructures and motifs (ASSAM), which models the
problem as a sub—graph isomorphism problem. ASSAM searches for
maximum common sub—graphs to find similar structures between
the template active site and the enzyme. The graph represents the
amino acids in the side chain, and each node consists of two pseudo—
atoms. Distances among different structures are calculated using
root—mean—squared deviation (RMSD).

Lightstone et al. (2013), in turn, introduced catalytic site identifi—
cation (CatSId). The algorithm performs a protein—to—template
matching using a sub—graph search method and a library of catalytic
residue templates from catalytic site atlas (CSA; Porter et (11.,
2004)—a database of catalytic sites in enzymes of known 3D struc—
ture. These results are refined using a logistic scoring procedure to
re—score the matches found in the first phase and use information
such as binding site predictions and others physical descriptors to
improve the structure matching previously obtained.

Many methods have also been proposed for substrate binding
site in the context of the CASP competition (Cassarino et (11., 2014).
SP—ALIGN (Brylinski and Skolnick, 2008), for instance, detects sub—
strate binding sites by remote template identification and superim—
position, structure—pocket alignment and binding site clustering
guided by the template substrates. 3DLigandSite (Wass et (11., 2010),
in contrast, aligns similar structures with the query, superimposing
their bound ligands onto the query structure.

This article proposes a method to identify active sites using gen—
etic algorithms (GAs) and information about the proteins 3D struc—
ture. GAs are widely used to solve combinatorial search problems
and emulate the process of evolution and survival of the fittest
(Goldberg, 1989). They have the advantage of performing a global
search, being independent of application and tolerant to noise (Back
at 111., 1997).

The proposed method can perform non—exact amino acid
matches without restricting the number of amino acids in the tem—
plate and finds catalytic residues and binding residues in differ—
ent protein chains. Its global heuristic search is used to prune the
search space, and only information about the 3D structure is
required. Having the active sites identified in a second phase, protein

function can be inferred using methods based on a similarity thresh—
old or more sophisticated techniques, such as logistic regression
(Lightstone et (11., 2013).

2 Materials and methods

This section introduces the principles of genetic active site search
(GASS), details the evaluation strategy and describes the datasets
used in the experimental evaluation.

2.1 Genetic active site search

The problem of identifying active sites in proteins can be defined as
follows. Given a set of N amino acids that compose the active site
A1 of a protein 17A of known function, and a second hypothetical
protein 173 of unknown function and sequence size M. The problem
is to search for a match of A1 in 173. The naive solution to this prob—
lem is to enumerate all possible arrangements of M amino acids in
173 and select those with most similar amino acid conformation and
relative position to 173. However, this solution becomes intractable
as M grows. Hence, an alternative solution to this problem is to
explore heuristic methods to perform this search, and here we inves—
tigate GAs.

Figure 1 illustrates the framework proposed to search similar
active sites, named GASS. GASS receives as inputs the proteins and
templates selected by the user and starts a preprocessing step. Note
that the method can be explored in two different scenarios: to find a
specific template (i.e. known active site) in one or more proteins or,
given a set of templates, to find them in one or more proteins. The
preprocessing step finds the selected proteins and active sites tem—
plates in protein data bank (PDB; Berman et (11., 2000) and CSA and
returns, for each amino acid, its name, chain, reference atom and
coordinates (x, y and z). This information is stored in a repository
of proteins, and accessed by GASS to create its initial population,
as detailed in the next sections. GASS then performs a heuristic
search to find matching active sites in the selected proteins, and
outputs one or more candidate active sites. In order to deal with
conservative mutation, GASS also has the option of consulting a
substitution matrix.

GASS is a method based on Darwin’s theory of evolution and
survival of the fittest. It evolves a population of individuals, where
each individual represents a solution to the problem at hand. In this
article, each solution corresponds to a candidate active site. These
solutions are evaluated according to a fitness function, which
assesses how good the individual is to solve the problem (e.g. we can

use the distance from the template to the candidate active site as a
fitness measure). Individuals are selected to undergo crossover and
mutation operations according to probabilities defined by the user
(175 and pm). This process goes on until a stop criterion, which
is usually based on a maximum number of generations, is met. This
process is illustrated in the Supplementary Figure S1.

2.1.1 Individual representation and population initialization

For the problem of active site matching, an individual represents a
group of amino acids, which is a candidate active site for an enzyme.
The individual is encoded as a vector, where each position represents
an amino acid. Figure 2a shows the catalytic site of enzyme synthesis
of human endothelial nitric oxide arginine substrate (3NOS) and its
GASS representation. Looking at the first amino acid in Figure 2b,
note that GASS stores its name (CYS), chain (A), position in the
sequence (184), the last heavy atom (LHA) of the side chain (SG)
and its coordinates (17.125, 8.914, 23.94).

The choice of LHA as the reference atom was made after com—
parisons with two other references: ot—carbon (AC) and side chain
centroid (SCC; for more details, see Supplementary Table S1 and
Fig. S2). Results showed that the performance of the method with
different references varies slightly from one dataset to another.
We chose LHA because it does not increase preprocessing computa—
tional cost (as SCC does) and uses information about the side chain
instead of the backbone [and catalytic residues are more frequent
in the side chain than in the main chain (Bartlett et (11., 2002)].

The initial population is generated from the protein repository.
Each individual corresponds to 71 amino acids that are randomly
chosen from the repository, always respecting the types of the amino
acids from the template and its size (i.e. if the first position in
the template is a glutamate, only glutamate may be selected for that
position and the size of the individual is equal to the size of the
template). In this way, it is possible to have individuals with amino

acids from different chains. As explained later, conservative muta—
tions are handled by the mutation operator.

2.1.2 Fitness function and selection

GASS individuals are evaluated by calculating the distance between
the coordinates of the LHA of the template, represented by a vector
of its 3D coordinates (v) and the candidate active site found by
GASS (W), according to Equation (1). Note that the difference
between the metric in Equation (1) and the well—known RMSD is
that we do not average the squared distances of the results. This is
because, as shown in Laskowski et al. (2005), slightly different ac—
tive sites may have similar RMSD values. By using their absolute
value distances we try to avoid this problem.

 

The individual’s evaluation is followed by the selection phase.
This phase is crucial for the evolution of the population, as it gives
a greater chance of survival to the best individuals, according to
their fitness function. There are several selection methods in the lit—
erature (Back at 111., 1997). We used tournament selection, where
a subset of [2 individuals is randomly selected from the population,
and the one with best fitness value is chosen to undergo crossover
and mutation operations.

2.1.3 Genetic operators

After selection, two genetic operators are used to generate a new
population: standard one—point crossover and single—point mutation.
Figure 2 illustrates both methods. Two individuals are required for
crossover and one for mutation. In crossover, a random position in
the individual is selected, and the amino acids before that point
in the first parent merged with the amino acids after that point
in the second parent (Fig. 2c). These new individuals are then added
to the new population.

In the case of the single—point mutation, only the point chosen is
replaced by either (i) a random amino acid of the same type from
the selected enzyme (TRP 356 by TRP 190 in Fig. 2d) or (ii) a differ—
ent type of amino acid indicated by the substitution matrix in the
same enzyme (GLU 361 by ASP 369 in Fig. 2d). The substitution
matrix was borrowed from Lightstone et al. (2013) and indicates
possible conservative mutations in active sites annotated in CSA.

2.1.4 Candidate active sites
GAs have one characteristic that differs them from other search
methods: they explore the search space by searching different sets of
solutions (individuals) in parallel. Hence, at the end of the evolution
process, we end up with a set of candidate active sites as big as the
population size. When the user needs a unique solution, the individ—
ual with the best fitness is returned. In some cases, however, it might
be interesting for the user to analyse a set of solutions, and then use
another set of criteria, perhaps more subjective, to choose the best.

For instance, it might be that the best solution—the one with
smallest distance from the template, is buried in the protein, instead
of being in a pocket. The specialist can immediately recognize the
candidate active site is not a real one. In order to avoid situations
like that, the method returns a ranking of the 71 best solutions found.
In this way, a specialist can choose the most appropriate according
to his background knowledge.

More details about GASS search space and computational com—
plexity can be found in the Supplementary Material.

2.2 Evaluation strategies

Two evaluation strategies were proposed to evaluate GASS. In the
first, results generated by GASS are validated according to the
enzymes catalytic sites catalogued in CSA (Bartlett et (11., 2002).
CSA is a database of 3D structures of catalytic residues that stores
two types of entries: originally annotated and manually derived
from the primary literature (LIT) and automatically identified sites
found by alignment using PSI—BLAST. In CSA, a residue is defined
as catalytic if it fulfils any one of the following criteria: (i) It is direct
involved in the catalytic mechanism; (ii) It alters the pKA of another
residue or water molecule directly involved in the catalytic mechan—
ism; (iii) It represents a stabilization of a transition state or inter—
mediate and (iv) It is responsible for the activation of a substrate
(Furnham et (11., 2014). As far as we are concerned, CSA is the most
complete database that can be used as a gold standard for compar—
ing the results of catalytic sites identification methods. The second
evaluation strategy uses a set of templates of substrate binding
sites considered in the 2012 CASP competition, namely CASP 10,
and compares the results obtained by GASS with those of the 17
competing methods.

For each experiment, GASS was executed 30 times. This is neces—
sary to obtain statistical significance in the results, once the method
is non—deterministic and each execution may return a different
result. Preliminary tests were performed to configure a set of par—
ameters required by GASS to find active sites. As all GAs, GASS
requires the definition of the following parameters: number of gen—
erations, population size, probability of crossover and mutation,
tournament size and, in our case, candidate ranking size. The values
of these parameters are listed in the Supplementary Table S2).

2.3 Datasets

Five datasets were used in the experiments, and they were selected
to answer the following questions: (i) Can GASS find catalytic sites
within a family? (ii) Can GASS help functionally classify enzyme
families? (iii) How does GASS handle less—controlled datasets?
(iv) How does GASS compare with other state—of—the—art methods?
They are the following:

DS 1: 125 enzymes from the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) family
(EC:1.14.13.39) with catalytic sites annotated in CSA. This group
was also tested with other 126 enzymes, randomly chosen from
PDB, and with EC numbers different from EC 1.—.—.—.

DS 2: 1085 enzymes Trypsin-like randomly chosen from PDB using
SCOP (http://scop.berkeley.edu/) classiﬁcation (superfamily 1A0]).

DS 3: 24,437 enzymes from the database NCBI VAST non—
redundant (P—value 10e—80), as reported in Nadzirin et al. (2012),
and one set containing 100 enzymes chosen from PDB based on
the results of ASSAM.

DS 4: 61 enzymes and 1800 templates selected from CSA, as done
in CatSId (Lightstone et (11., 2013).

DS 5: 13 target enzymes and 25 binding site templates for each en—
zyme, according to CASP 10 FN category (Cassarino et (11., 2014).

3 Results

This section discusses the results obtained when evaluating GASS
using the two strategies previously described. A summary of the re—
sults obtained by GASS when comparing its results with CSA tem—
plates is presented in Table 1. The differences among the number
of enzymes searched and those with known catalytic sites in CSA
happen for two reasons: (i) sometimes an enzyme has more than one

For each DS we show the number of enzymes and templates, the number of
catalytic sites annotated in CSA (gold standard) and the number of catalytic
sites found correctly by GASS, the percentage number of catalytic sites found
in relation to those annotated in CSA and the ranking size used by GASS.

catalytic site; (ii) not all enzymes have their catalytic sites catalogued
in CSA. The results are detailed in the following sections.

3.1 Can GASS find catalytic sites within a family?

In order to answer this question, GASS was used to find one cata—
lytic site in the set of 125 NOS family enzymes (DS 1). Note that the
quality of the results of GASS highly depends on the quality of
the templates. Hence, catalytic sites annotated as literature are more
appropriate for this type of search. First, we tested 3NOS as a tem—
plate, as it is the only CSA LIT entry among all NOS enzymes.

In this case, GASS correctly found all 248 catalytic sites (CSA—
version 2.2.12). Observing the values of fitness [defined in Equation
(1)] of all candidate catalytic sites (individuals) in the final popula—
tion, we noticed that 84.13% presented distances from the template
£5  This shows that the majority of enzymes within the same fam—
ily have small distances variation between their catalytic sites.

However, there are exceptions. An example is the enzyme mur—
ine ino synthase with coumarin inhibitor (2BHJ), which presented
a fitness value of 11.64 A, which is twice the value of fitness
found for most enzymes in the NOS family. This difference occurs
because of the enzyme’s ligand. In 3NOS, the ligand HAR—5 12
(N—omega—hydroxy—L—arginine) occupies a small volume when
compared with ligand FC1—1499 (thiocoumarin) in 2BH], as showed
in the Supplementary Figure S4.

Considering 30 different runs of the GASS for all enzymes, we
also calculated the mean and standard deviation of the fitness for
each enzyme. Only 3 out of 125 catalytic sites found (individuals)
had a standard deviation different from 0 (1NOC, 1NOS and
2NOS; see Supplementary Figure S3), which shows that the results
found have a very low variability between different GASS runs.
Low variability is necessary to guarantee a robust search method.

In a second step, we also used each of the other 124 enzymes
annotated in CSA using PSI—BLAST as templates for searching the
remaining enzymes, including 3NOS for completeness (all against
all). Considering 125 enzymes, we had 248 catalytic sites annotated
in CSA. In average, for each of the 125 X 30 experiments performed,
GASS found 235.31 catalytic sites correctly according to CSA
(94.49%).

3.2 Can GASS help classifying families?
As previously explained, GASS always returns as a result a ranking
of the most similar catalytic sites to the template. Hence, even when

an enzyme does not have that particular site, the most similar set of
amino acids is returned. This second experiment was run in a group
of 251 enzymes, 125 from the NOS family (DS 1) and 126 randomly
chosen from PDB using 3NOS as a template. This test shows how
many false positives (enzymes that do not have the catalytic site but
had it detected) the method generates given a distance threshold.
Analysing the values of fitness of the identified catalytic sites,
80.95% presented values >10A for the 126 enzymes in the random
set. Only one catalytic site (0.79%) presented template distances
smaller than 5  This may suggest that enzymes in different families
tend to have very different catalytic sites, and GASS was able to iden—
tify that. Figure 3a shows the distance results of GASS considering
enzymes from the NOS family and random enzymes. As expected,
enzymes within the same family are closer to the template than
random enzymes.

Figure 3b shows a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
(Hand, 2009), indicating the ability of catalytic sites distances
from the family template to correctly assign the family of an enzyme
based on a simple distance threshold. The area under the curve
(AUC) considering the distance threshold is 0.97.

3.3 How does GASS handle less—controlled datasets?
Previous tests were performed with small and very controlled sets
of enzymes, specifically chosen to test some properties of the algo—
rithm. This section comprises experiments with DS 2, composed of
1085 Trypsin-like enzymes randomly chosen from PDB. The nine
templates annotated as LIT in CSA and given as input to GASS are
listed in the Supplementary Table S3.

After running the nine templates against 1085 enzymes, GASS
found, in average, 899 catalytic sites annotated in CSA (82.85%)
in the first position of the ranking. Increasing the ranking size to 5,
we had 987 catalytic sites correctly identified (90.94%). When the
size of the ranking was 10, the number of catalytic sites was 1015
(93.52%). A more detailed analysis per template can be found in
the Supplementary Table S4.

Figure 3c shows a cumulative match score curve (CMS) for the
most successful template (1A0]) and the average considering all
nine templates of the catalytic sites found by GASS. This curve

amino acids on the surface

shows the relation between the number of correct catalytic site
found according to CSA and their position in the ranking. Analysing
the curves, we observe that the best catalytic site candidates appear
mostly in the top five positions of the ranking.

An analysis of the catalytic sites not found by GASS was also
performed, and we identified three reasons for that: (i) the catalytic
site is not in CSA, (ii) the catalytic site is in CSA but was found using
PSI—BLAST, and appears divided into different chains; (iii) conserva—
tive mutations not reﬂected in the substitution matrix borrowed
from Lightstone et al. (2013) occurred. One example of an enzyme
not annotated in CSA is 1ARC, where GASS identified the catalytic
site HIS 57, ASP 113 and SER 194, which is in agreement with
Tsunasawa et al. (1989; Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6).

Concerning situation (ii), the catalytic site of 2GCT is stored in
CSA as three distinct sites [HIS 57 and ASP 102 (chain B), GLY 193
and SER 195 (chain C), SER 195 and GLY 196 (chain C)]. GASS
found amino acids HIS 57 and ASP 102 (chain B) and SER 195
(chain C), as shown in Figure 4. This example shows a drawback
of PSI—BLAST alignments made by CSA, which in this case split
what might be a single site into three different ones. Hence, although
this may seem like a GASS error, it is actually a problem of CSA
when dealing with catalytic sites in different chains.

3.4 How do GASS results compare with those obtained
by other state—of—the—ait methods?

This section compares GASS against two others recently reported in
the literature to find catalytic sites: ASSAM (Nadzirin et al., 2012)
and CatSId (Lightstone et al., 2013). It also compares the results
of GASS with 17 methods submitted to the CASP 10 competition
regarding substrate—binding site templates.

3.4.1 GASS XASSAM
First, it is important to emphasize the main differences between
ASSAM and GASS. ASSAM represents amino acids using
pseudo—atoms, while GASS uses LHA. Concerning the metric used
to calculate the distances from the template, ASSAM uses RMSD
while GASS uses Equation (1). After search, ASSAM reports the
100 most similar active sites to the template, ordered by RMSD,
and reference templates are limited to 12 amino acids. GASS has
no limit for the latter, and can return as many active sites as its
population site.

In order to compare GASS with ASSAM, we used as template
the structure 1AOS (Salmonella typhimurium sucrose specific
porin ScrY), reported in Nadzirin et al. (2012) and DS3. GASS was

run against each of the enzymes in DS 3, and the results ordered
according to their fitness values.

Among the 100 results reported by ASSAM are the structures
1AOT and 1OH2, discussed in Nadzirin et al. (2012), which are ex—
amples of specific porin sucrose. GASS found all the three catalytic
sites of 1AOT structure (chains R, P and Q) at positions 1, 4 and 7 of
a ranking with 100 enzymes. Realizing the absence of the structure
1OH2, we noticed it was not in DS3. Checking more closely the re—
sults of ASSAM, only 23 out of 100 results returned are in the ori—
ginal dataset. We believe ASSAM added more structures to the
original database using SPRITE (Nadzirin et al., 2012). However,
once this procedure was not documented, it could not be mimicked.

As an alternative, we simulated what would have happened if
GASS had access to the 100 enzymes output by ASSAM, analysing
specially if the relative order of the enzymes would change, given the
methods use different template distance metrics. This is not ideal,
but it is one way to compare our results. These 100 enzymes were
given as input data to GASS and the structure 1ACB (bovine alpha—
chymotrypsin—eglin C complex) used as template. In this case, the re—
sults obtained by ASSAM and GASS were very similar. Both found
the same 79 catalytic sites in accordance with CSA, and the remain—
ing 21 were discarded because they were not catalogued in CSA.
However, for some enzymes, ASSAM omitted or incorrectly re—
ported the chain of the catalytic site amino acids. This is the case of
enzymes 1AU] and 6CHA. GASS found the catalytic site for 1AU]
in chain A (in agreement with CSA) while ASSAM did not report the
chain. For 6CHA, GASS found the catalytic site and the respective
chain of each residue (HIS—57 (B), ASP—102 (B), 195—SER (C)), while
ASSAM located the site in chain A. However, the PDB file
for 6CHA has only nine amino acids in chain A, and none of them
correspond to HIS, ASP, or SER, which are the amino acids of the
catalytic site of 6CHA. This error may have happened because the
amino acids of the catalytic site are in different chains (B and C).

3.4.2 GASS X CatSId

CatSId differs from GASS in the following: (i) it represents a tem—
plate using the coordinates of the ot—carbon, cofactor and/or ion;
(ii) the optimized sub—graph isomorphism search performed in the
first phase of the method uses a threshold (1.5 A) to prune non—
promising sub—graphs; (iii) it uses RMSD to measure enzymes/
template distances; (iv) its second phase performs a logistic scoring
procedure, which uses much more information about the enzymes
than GASS, including physicochemical descriptors.

For a fair comparison between the methods, the same templates
and the same enzymes used by CatSId in its first phase should be
considered. However, as CatSId does not report it, we used the en—
zymes and templates considered in the second phase. CatSId used
1993 templates (LIT—CSA) to search catalytic sites in 66 randomly
chosen enzymes (CSA—version 2.2.12). GASS used 1800 templates
to search catalytic sites in 61 enzymes. This difference in the number
of templates and enzymes is due to the lack of information (position
of the LHA of the side chain) in some PDB files and the fact that
we did not use non—standard amino acids. DS 4 enzymes are listed
in Supplementary Table S5.

In total, there were 182 catalytic sites found in 61 enzymes.
GASS found 165 catalytic sites correctly. The 17 sites not found
belong to seven enzymes (see Supplementary Table S5). We identi—
fied two situations where errors occurred. In five of them GASS
finds the catalytic sites, but not within the top five rank. This might
happen because all templates for these enzymes have substitutions.
This increases even further the search space and makes GASS

generates many individuals with better fitness values than those in
the real site in comparison with the template. Examples of this case
are available in the Supplementary Figure S7. Another problem
emerges because of CSA errors, such as for enzymes 1L7A and
1G1Y (Supplementary Fig. S7).

Figure 3d shows the CMS of the active sites found by GASS.
Using ranking size 5, GASS found 165 sites correctly, which corres—
ponds to an accuracy of 90.65%. The other catalytic sites were
found from the 35th position on due to the large number of possible
substitutions.

3.4.3 GASS X CASP 10 methods

We also compared GASS to the 17 methods submitted to the FN
category of the CASP 10 competition. The dataset used has 13 target
enzymes and 25 binding sites templates for each target. First, we
defined GASS templates for each target using the residues from
templates provided by CASP 10 according to Cassarino et al.
(2014). For 2 out of the 13 targets we could not identify the ligand
in the templates structures, and hence the comparison used 11 out
of the 13 targets.

GASS was run with the same parameter configuration used
against ASSAM and CastId, without the substitution matrix. For
each target, the results obtained were ordered according to their
fitness value, and the function of the top—ranking individual used as
GASS final prediction. On the basis of this result, we calculated
the Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC), MCC Z—scores and
binding—site distance test (BDT; Supplementary Table S7) as well as
the cumulative confusion matrices, and for statistical significance
the Wilcoxon signed—rank test was used (Supplementary Tables S8
and S9) (Matthews, 1975; Roche et al., 2010). These results were
compared with those obtained by 17 other methods proposed in
CASP 10. As CASP 10 guidelines, the two targets with unidentified
ligands (T0659 and T0721) were considered as having MCC zero.

Figure 5 shows the overall performance of GASS and all partici—
pating groups from CASP 10. The groups were ranked according to
the average value of their MCCs normalized on all prediction targets
(see Supplementary Table S6). Among the 11 targets considered,
GASS found five binding sites correctly, and appears fourth in the
ranking, with average MCC value of 0.63. Note that, from the three
methods with better performance than GASS one is validated by

human experts, while GASS is completely automatic. GASS is third
among the automatic methods.

According to CASP 10, T0657 and T0659 were the most chal—
lenging targets, as predictors obtained the lowest MCC scores for
them. T0659 was not considered in GASS tests, as its ligand was not
found. For target T0657, GASS found the binding site correctly.
Note that GASS results can be further improved by using a more
complete substitution matrix (recall that the one used here was cre—
ated by analysing the CSA conservative mutations) and a fine—tuned
parameter optimization for GASS.

4 Conclusion

This work proposed GASS, a method for active site search based
on GAs. The method receives as input one or more active sites
templates, and looks for them in one or more proteins, returning a
ranking of solutions as big as its population size. It also takes into
account conservative mutations during the search by using a substi—
tution matrix. The method can also find active sites in different
protein chains, and its results can be further improved by using add—
itional attributes to describe the sites. GASS has no predefined crite—
ria to search the candidate solution space, such as CatSId, nor uses
a limit for the size of the active site, as ASSAM does. Results show
the method is effective in finding catalytic sites already catalogued
in CSA, with accuracy rates above 90% in most datasets. Besides,
when considering the dataset used in the FN task in CASP 10,
when compared with the other 17 methods, GASS is ranked fourth
according to values of MCC. It can be a powerful tool to improve
the current catalytic sites and add new ones to CSA.

As future work, we intend to enhance the presented techniques so
it verifies the accessibility and location of the amino acids (pockets)
found by GASS. The current solution can be further extended to con—
sider physicochemical attributes during GASS search. Additional tests
with other substitution matrices will also be performed (Yamada and
Tomii, 2014). Finally, we plan to make GASS available from a web
server after the aforementioned issues are addressed.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Systems approaches to studying phenotypic relation-
ships among diseases are emerging as an active area of research
for both novel disease gene discovery and drug repurposing.
Currently, systematic study of disease phenotypic relationships on a
phenome-wide scale is limited because large-scale machine-under-
standable disease—phenotype relationship knowledge bases are often
unavailable. Here, we present an automatic approach to extract dis-
ease—manifestation (D-M) pairs (one specific type of disease—pheno-
type relationship) from the wide body of published biomedical
literature.

Data and Methods: Our method leverages external knowledge and
limits the amount of human effort required. For the text corpus, we
used 119085 682 MEDLINE sentences (21 354075 citations). First, we
used D-M pairs from existing biomedical ontologies as prior know-
ledge to automatically discover D-M—specific syntactic patterns. We
then extracted additional pairs from MEDLINE using the learned
patterns. Finally, we analysed correlations between disease manifest-
ations and disease-associated genes and drugs to demonstrate the
potential of this newly created knowledge base in disease gene
discovery and drug repurposing.

Results: In total, we extracted 121 359 unique D-M pairs with a high
precision of 0.924. Among the extracted pairs, 120419 (99.2%) have
not been captured in existing structured knowledge sources. We have
shown that disease manifestations correlate positively with both dis-
ease-associated genes and drug treatments.

Conclusions: The main contribution of our study is the creation of a
large-scale and accurate D-M phenotype relationship knowledge
base. This unique knowledge base, when combined with existing
phenotypic, genetic and proteomic datasets, can have profound im-
plications in our deeper understanding of disease etiology and in rapid
drug repurposing.

approaches to uncovering disease etiology. One recognized limi-
tation of current computational candidate disease gene predic-
tion (Barabsi et al., 2011; Baudot et al., 2009; Doncheva et al.,
2012; Kann, 2010; Piro and Di Cunto, 2012; Tifﬁn et al., 2009;
Tranchevent et al., 2011; Vidal et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011)
and drug repurposing (Chen et al., 2009; Hu and Agarwal,
2009; Keiser et al., 2009; Kinnings et al., 2009; Lamb et al.,
2006; Noeske et al., 2006; Sirota et al., 2011) approaches is
that the selection of gene or drug candidates is based on known
molecular basis of diseases, genes or drugs, and is therefore
limited in the capacity of identifying novel disease genes or
new drug targets. It has been increasingly recognized that
phenotypically related diseases often reﬂect overlapping mo-
lecular causations (Lee et al., 2008; Oti et al., 2008; Park
et al., 2009; Roque et al., 2011; thetsky et al., 2007).
Therefore, the systematic study of phenotypic relationships
among human diseases and integration of disease phenotypic
data with existing genetic and ‘omics’ data will allow for the
elucidation of disease genetic mechanisms and the development
of effective drug therapies without requiring detailed knowledge
of the exact relationships among genes, which often are not
clearly understood. However, current systematic study of dis-
ease phenotypic relationships on both phenome- and genome-
wide scale is limited owing to the fact that large-scale machine-
understandable disease phenotype knowledge bases are often
not available. The lack of disease phenotype data to comple-
ment genetic and proteomic datasets has limited scientiﬁc pro-
gress towards elucidating the origins of human disease for
better disease prevention and treatment. Our ultimate research
goal is to build a large-scale and accurate diseaseiphenotype
relationship knowledge base from published literature, patient
electronic health records (EHRs), biomedical ontologies and
other knowledge sources. This diseaseiphenotype knowledge
base will include relationships such as diseaseirisk (environmen-
tal risk factors and predisposing diseases), diseasewlisease c0-
morbidity, diseaseiorgan, diseaseimanifestation (D-M) (symp-
tom), among others. In this study, we focus on automatically
extracting D-M pairs from the large amount of published bio-
medical literature (22 million citations in MEDLINE so far).
As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst large-scale effort focusing on
automatically extracting diseaseiphenotype relationship know-
ledge from published biomedical literature. The unique diseasei
phenotype knowledge base we create can have profound

implications in our deeper understanding of disease etiology
and in rapid drug repurposing.

2 BACKGROUND

Recently, disease phenotypic similarity has become another
major data source exploited by computational methods for pri-
oritization of candidate disease genes (Chen et al., 2011; Guo
et al., 2011; Hoehndorf et al., 2011; Hwang et al., 2011; Lage
et al., 2007; Li and Patra, 2010; Vanunu et al., 2010; Wu et al.,
2008; Yang et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2011). The advantage of this
phenotype-driven approach over traditional computational gene
candidate selection approaches is that we can hypothesize (not
making any limiting assumptions about underlying disease and
gene mechanisms) that the similar phenotypes in two diseases
may result from genes/pathways that are involved in the same
biological process, until proved otherwise. For phenotype-driven
candidate gene selection, a two-layered heterogeneous data net-
work is often constructed where the phenotypic network layer
consists of connections between similar diseases, while the genetic
network layer contains molecular data such as proteiniprotein
interaction, pathways, gene co-expression or shared protein
domain. These two network layers are linked through known
diseaseigene associations. For example, Li et al. demonstrated
the importance of the additional phenotype network layer in
identifying novel diseaseigene associations by extending a
random-walk algorithm to this heterogeneous network where
both the candidate genes and the disease phenotypes are prior-
itized simultaneously (Li and Patra, 2010). Currently, the disease
phenotype networks are mainly constructed based on disease co-
morbidity (Lage et al., 2007) or text mining of the Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database (Chen et al.,
2011; Guo et al., 2011; Hoehndorf et al., 2011; Hwang et al.,
2011; Lage et al., 2007; Li and Patra, 2010; Van Driel et al., 2006;
Vanunu et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2008; Yao et al., 2011; Yang et al.,
2011). To signiﬁcantly enrich the currently available disease
phenotype datasets, we are developing natural language process-
ing and data mining techniques to extract broad types of disease
phenotype relationships, including D-M, diseaseirisk factor,
diseaseiorgan, diseasewo-comorbidity and others, from pub-
lished literature, patient EHRs, biomedical ontologies and
large observational health datasets. Our goal is to augment cur-
rent computational candidate disease gene selection and drug
repurposing approaches by increasing both the amount and
overall quality of available disease phenotype information. For
this study, we focus on automatically extracting D-M relation-
ships from biomedical literature.

Diseases with similar clinical manifestations may share
common genetic mechanisms. For example, Stickler Syndrome
is characterized by myopia, retinal detachment, hearing loss, cleft
palate and arthropathy. Based on manifestation similarity,
both Marshall syndrome and Oto-Spondylo-Megaepiphyseal
Dysplasia (OSMED) syndrome have similar facial and skeletal
features as Stickler syndrome. Mutations in COL2A1, COL11A2
and COL11A1 are responsible for the Stickler, OSMED and
Marshall syndromes, respectively (Brunner and van Driel,
2004). The proteins encoded by these genes form a single trimeric
collagen-11 protein molecule whose malfunctions are responsible
for these three syndromes. A large amount of D-M semantic

relationships has been captured in existing medical ontologies.
For example, 50 551 D-M pairs are included in Unified Medical
Language System (UMLS) (2011 version) ﬁle MRREL.RRF.
However, most of the D-M pairs in UMLS are for rare syn-
dromes such as Marfan syndrome, Williams syndrome and
Mccune-Albright syndrome. On the other hand, many D-M as-
sociations are reported in biomedical literature, but not captured
in exiting medical ontologies. For example, 166 clinical manifest-
ations have been reported to be associated with Marfan syn-
drome in MEDLINE. Among them, 152 manifestations
(91.5%) are not captured in UMLS. Among them, spontaneous
pneumothorax, annuloaortic ectasia, migraine, epilepsy and
sleep-disordered breathing are reported multiple times in
biomedical literature, but not included in UMLS for Marfan
syndrome. This demonstrates that these two knowledge sources
(literature versus ontologies) largely complement each other. In
addition, while D-M pairs in UMLS are mainly for rare
syndromes, the pairs extracted from biomedical literature also
include common complex diseases such as systemic lupus erythe-
matosus, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus. Hence, D-M
pairs extracted from literature, in combination with pairs from
existing medical ontologies, will serve as an important source of
disease phenotype information.

3 APPROACH

The large body of published biomedical literature (more than 22
million citations on MEDLINE) is among the richest data
sources for systematically identifying D-M and other disease
phenotype relationships. While many biomedical relationship ex-
traction tasks have focused on extracting speciﬁc types of rela-
tionships between drugs, proteins, diseases or genes (Ananiadou
et al., 2010; Blaschke et al., 1999; Craven et al., 1999; Friedman
et al., 2001; Rindﬁesch et al., 2000; Rosario and Hearst, 2004; Xu
and Wang, 2013), less research has focused on extracting dis-
easeiphenotype relationships. Recently, we have developed
semi-supervised pattern learning approaches for named entity
recognition 0(u et al., 2008, 2009a), relationship extraction
0(u et al., 2009b) and medical image retrieval from the web
(Chen et al., 2012). Semi-supervised pattern learning approaches
have the advantages of requiring minimal human intervention
and no external domain knowledge. We have also developed a
knowledge-driven ranking approach to extract drugigene rela-
tionships from MEDLINE by leveraging on existing biomedical
knowledge 0(u and Wang, 2012). Like semi-supervised iterative
learning approaches, the knowledge-driven approach requires
minimal human annotation, while at the same time, leveraging
prior knowledge to prevent the semantic drifting problem inher-
ent in many semi-supervised iterative learning systems. Because
our ultimate goal is to develop systems approaches in exploiting
diseaseiphenotype relationships for network-based candidate
gene prediction and drug repurposing, accuracy and scalability
of the relationship extraction algorithms are critical. In this
study, we develop a knowledge-driven pattern learning relation-
ship extraction approach (a hybrid of above semi-supervised pat-
tern learning approach and knowledge-driven ranking approach)
to accurately extract D-M pairs from MEDLINE by leveraging
on prior knowledge from biomedical ontologies. Our approach is

highly accurate, efﬁcient and requires minimal manual curation

4 METHODS

The entire experimental process consists of the following steps (Fig. 1): (i)
Obtain and parse MEDLINE corpus; (ii) Extract existing D-M pairs
from UMLS (prior knowledge); (iii) Extract D-M pairs from
MEDLINE in following steps: pattern ranking and selection, pair extrac-
tion and pair ranking; and (iv) Analyse the correlation between extracted
D-M pairs and disease-associated genes and drugs (integrative correlation
analysis).

4.1 Build a local MEDLINE search engine

We downloaded 21 354075 MEDLINE citations (119 085 682 sentences)
published between 1965 and 2012 from the US National Library of
Medicine (http://mbr.nlm.nih.gov/Download/index.shtml). Each sentence
was syntactically parsed with Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2003)
using the Amazon Cloud computing service (3500 instance-hours with
High-CPU Extra Large Instance used). We used the publicly available
information retrieval library Lucene (http://luceneapache.org) to create a
local MEDLINE search engine with indices created on both sentences
and their corresponding parse trees.

4.2 Extract existing D-M pairs from UMLS as prior
knowledge

We extracted 50 551 D-M pairs from the UMLS (2011 version) ﬁle
MRREL.RRF (Bodenreider, 2004). We then expanded the terms in D-M
pairs to include all the synonyms to capture term usage variations in bio-
medical literature. After expansion, we obtained 3 499 871 D-M pairs,
which were used to discover D-Mispeciﬁc patterns from MEDLINE.

4.3 Extract additional D-M pairs from MEDLINE

4.3.] Create clean disease lexico A highly accurate and comprehen-
sive disease lexicon is critical for the task of building a high-quality dis-
easeiphenotype relationship knowledge base. We built a clean disease
lexicon by combining and manually cleaning all disease terms in
UMLS and in Human Disease Ontology (http://bioportal.bioontology.
org/ontologies/ 1009). Incorrectly classiﬁed disease terms (e. g. brain, liver,
worms), ambiguous terms (e.g. brash, giants, consumption, inversion,
blind, cold) and general terms (e.g. disease, syndrome, disorder) were
manually removed. The final disease lexicon consisted of 70 247 terms.
The knowledge-driven D-M relationship extraction system is depicted
in Figure 2 and consists of the following: (i) Pattern extraction, wherein
syntactical patterns associated with known D-M pairs are extracted;
(ii) Pattern ranking and selection, wherein patterns are ranked and
D-Mispeciﬁc patterns are selected from top-ranked patterns; (iii) Pair

extraction, wherein additional pairs associated with selected patterns
are extracted from MEDLINE; and (iv) Pair ranking, wherein extracted
D-M pairs are ranked based on the ranking scores of their associated
patterns and co-occurrence frequency.

4.3.2 Pattern extraction To ﬁnd D-Mespeciﬁc patterns, we used the
expanded known D-M pairs as search queries to the local search engine.
Sentences and their corresponding parse trees containing any known
D-M pairs were retrieved. The patterns ‘NPI pattern NPZ’, where the
noun phrase pair NP17NP2 is a known D-M pair, were extracted from
the retrieved parse trees. The pattern is ‘D pattern M’ if disease precedes
manifestation or ‘M pattern D’ if the opposite is true. For example, using
D-M pair ‘CofﬁniLowry Syndromemental retardation’ as search query,
we retrieved the sentence ‘CofﬁniLowry Syndrome is characterized by
mental retardation, . . .’ (PMID 17249444). From this sentence, a D-Mi
speciﬁc pattern ‘D is characterized by M’ was discovered. The extra re-
quirement that both D and M must be noun phrases in the extracted
patterns is to ensure the high precision of extracted pairs. For example,
disease name ‘infection’ instead of ‘reovirus type 3 infection’ is included in
our disease lexicon. Without the NP restriction, incorrect (or too general)
pair ‘infection-primary biliary cirrhosis’ will be extracted from the sentence
‘Reovirus type 3 infection in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and
primary sclerosing cholangitis’. (PMID 2821105). By requiring that dis-
ease terms also have to be NP phrase, no pair will be extracted from this
sentence. In this way, high precision is guaranteed because term ‘infec-
tion’ by itself is not NP in this particular sentence (it may be NP in other
sentences though).

4.3.3 Pattern ranking and selection Not all patterns associated with
known D-M pairs are necessarily speciﬁc in describing D-Mispeciﬁc se-
mantic relationships. To ﬁnd patterns that are associated with many
known D-M pairs (high recall) and are also specific in describing D-M
relationships (high precision), we ﬁrst ranked extracted patterns by the
number of their associated known D-M pairs. The ranking scheme ranks
patterns highly that are associated with many known pairs. From the top-
ranked patterns, we manually selected D-Mispeciﬁc syntactic patterns.
The pattern ranking and manual selection processes ensured the high
recall (top ranked) and high precision (manually selected) of selected
patterns. After pattern ranking, the manual selection process entailed
minimal human time to scan top-ranked patterns (<15min).

4.3.4 Pair extraction The selected D-Mespeciﬁc syntactic patterns
were used as search queries to the local MEDLINE search engine.
Both sentences and parse trees that contained these patterns were
retrieved. We then extracted disease—disease pairs from the returned
parse trees using the pattern ‘NPI pattern NP2’, wherein NP] and NP2
are both noun phrases and disease terms, and the pattern is one of the
selected patterns. For example, using the D-M pair ‘CofﬁniLowry
Syndromemental retardation’ from UMLS, we found a D-Mispeciﬁc
pattern ‘D is characterized by M’ from the sentence ‘CofﬁniLowry
Syndrome is characterized by mental retardation, . . .’ (PMID
17249444). Then using the pattern ‘is characterized by’ as search query,
we retrieved the sentence ‘Sheehan’s syndrome is characterized by hypo-
pituitarism that occurs. . .’ (PMID 18797595) From this sentence, a new
(not included in UMLS) pair ‘Sheehan’s syndromehypopituitarism’ was

Towards building a disease-phenotype knowledge base

 

extracted because both Sheehan’s syndrome and hypopituitarism are dis-
ease terms in the disease lexicon, noun phrases in this sentences and
associated with D-Mispeciﬁc pattern ‘is characterized by’.

4.3.5 Pair ranking We ranked extracted D-M pairs based on their
associated pattern scores (as determined by the number of their asso-
ciated known D-M pairs) and co-occurrence frequencies. A reliable
D-M pair is one that is associated with reliable patterns many times.
The ranking score (RS) of a pair or relationship (R) RS(R) is deﬁned
as following:

n
RS(R) = Z log(RS(P,-)) >l< count(P,-, R) (1)
1'20
RS(P,-) is the score of its associated patterns (P,-) and is deﬁned as the
number of known D-M pairs from UMLS that are associated with the
pattern. count(P,-, R) is the number of times that the pair is associated
with the pattern in the entire MEDLINE corpus.

4.3.6 Evaluation For precision evaluation, we randomly selected 1000
pairs from extracted D-M pairs. This random selection did not take into
account pair frequencies, and therefore all pairs had the equal probability
to be selected. We retrieved all associated sentences for each selected pair
(along with its associated patterns) using the local search engine. Three
annotators with graduate degrees in biomedical domains independently
examined whether each pair was correctly extracted from these sentences
by our algorithm. Only the pairs agreed upon by all three curators were
counted as correct ones. However, the recall evaluation of the extracted
pairs was not performed because the space of disease manifestation for a
given disease is not known. We cannot use D-M pairs from UMLS
(mainly for rare syndromes) as a gold standard to measure the perform-
ance of MEDLINE-based D-M relationship extraction tasks because the
D-M knowledge represented in these two sources largely complement
each other. Note that the recall of the extracted D-M pairs is not the
same as the recall of the selected disease-speciﬁc patterns, which is high
because they were among the top-ranked patterns. Because our ultimate
goal is to develop systems approaches in exploiting diseasephenotype
relationships for network-based candidate gene prediction and for drug
repurposing, the accuracy (high precision) and large size (many unique
pairs) of the extracted D-M phenotype knowledge base will be critical.
Therefore, we only evaluated the accuracy of the relationship extraction
algorithm and calculated how many additional D-M pairs were extracted
from MEDLINE compared with those in UMLS. We believe that this
important diseasephenotype relationship knowledge base do not need to
be complete to be useful in the tasks of candidate disease gene selection
and in drug repurposing.

4.4 Analyse the correlation between extracted D-M pairs
and disease-associated drugs and genes

4.4.1 Correlation with disease-associated drugs We extracted
52000 disease—drug treatment pairs from ClinicalTrials.gov (http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov/), a registry of federally and privately supported
clinical trials conducted in the United States and around the
world (www.clinicaltrials.gov). Because the disease name usage in
ClinicalTrials.gov is often different from that found in MEDLINE, we
mapped all the names, including disease names and drug names, to
UMLS concept unique identiﬁers (CUIs). After mapping, we obtained
63 356 diseasedrug CUI pairs, corresponding to 5080 unique disease
CUIs and 2124 distinct drug CUIs. Note that some terms have more
than one CUI. We also mapped D-M pairs extracted from MEDLINE
to CUI pairs. For diseasedisease (CUI£UI) pairs that share different
number of manifestations, we calculated the corresponding average
number of shared drug treatments.

4.4.2 Correlation with disease-associated genes Similar to the cor-
relation analysis above, we analysed shared genetic components under-
lying disease—disease pairs with overlapping manifestations. We obtained
8658 diseasegene associations from OMIM (data accessed in April 2012)
(Harnosh et al., 2005) and 5895 traitisingle nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) pairs from National Human Genome Research Institute’s
GWAS Catalog database (data accessed in January 2012) (Hindorff
et al., 2012). OMIM is a database that catalogues all known diseases,
with a genetic component that focuses on the relationship between pheno-
type and genotype. The GWAS Catalog database is an online database of
SNPitrait associations derived from genome-wide association studies.
We mapped all disease and gene names to their corresponding UMLS
CUIs. After mapping, we obtained 13405 diseasegene CUI pairs cor-
responding to 2600 distinct disease CUIs and 5752 distinct gene CUIs
from OMIM. We obtained 7597 traitigene CUI pairs corresponding to
315 distinct diseases/traits CUIs and 3013 distinct gene CUIs from the
GWAS Catalog database. For diseasedisease (CUI£UI) pairs that
share manifestations at different cut-offs, we calculated the average
number of shared genes or SNPs.

5 RESULTS

5.1 Learning D-M—speciﬁc patterns

Using the expanded UMLS D-M pairs, we extracted 21 013 pat-
terns in the form of ‘D pattern M’ and 14171 patterns in the
form of ‘M pattern D’ from MEDLINE sentences. Many UMLS
D-M pairs did not appear in MEDLINE sentences. Among the
21013 ‘D pattern M’ patterns, 20588 (97.9%) are associated
with only one UMLS D-M pair. Similarly, among the 14171
‘M pattern D’ patterns, 13 715 (96.8%) are associated with only
one UMLS D-M pair. We ranked the extracted patterns based
on the number of their associated known D-M pairs. The top-
107ranked patterns along with the numbers of associated D-M
pairs are listed in Table 1. As shown in the table, among the top-
ranked patterns, there do in fact exist many D-Mispeciﬁc pat-
terns such as ‘M associated with D’, ‘M inpatients with D’and ‘M
due to D’.

Comparing the top patterns in the form of ‘D pattern M’ to
those in the form of ‘M pattern D’, we noticed that D-M asso-
ciations are often speciﬁed using the form ‘M pattern D’, wherein
the manifestation appears in front of the disease. Therefore, in
our subsequent relationship extraction, we only used patterns in
the form of ‘M pattern D’. From the top-107ranked ‘M pattern
D’ patterns, we manually selected six speciﬁc patterns, including
‘M in D’, ‘M associated with D’, ‘M in patients with D’, ‘M in a
patient with D’, ‘M due to D’ and ‘M of D’. Because the number
of pairs associated with each pattern rapidly decreases as the
rank increases, we only selected patterns from the top-Ilkranked
patterns. These manually selected patterns have high recall be-
cause they were among the top-ranked patterns. In addition,
these patterns have high precision because they are manually
picked. These six selected patterns were used to extract add-
itional D-M pairs from MEDLINE.

Pattern-based relationship extraction approaches often have
high precisions. However, the recalls depend on the size of the
underlying text corpus, pair frequencies in the corpus and the
usage of patterns in the text. Because the main goal of our study
is to accurately extract many additional D-M pairs from
MEDLINE and our goal is not to extract all available D-M
pairs, we only selected a few speciﬁc patterns with high recalls

to guarantee both high precision and relatively high recall. Pairs
that are not associated with these patterns will be missed.
Pattern-based learning methods in general can ﬁnd patterns
with both high precision and high recall with minimal human
effort; however, further improving the recall will require manual
examination of many more patterns or nonipattern-based
approaches.

5.2 Extract additional D-M pairs from MEDLINE using
speciﬁc patterns

Using the six selected patterns, we extracted an additional
120 419 distinct D-M pairs from MEDLINE sentences. Among
these pairs, 120419 pairs (99.2%) are not archived in UMLS.
While most of the D-M pairs in UMLS are for rare syndromes,
the pairs extracted from MEDLINE include both rare syn-
dromes and common complex diseases, such as systemic lupus
erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus. For
each of the six selected textual patterns, significantly more pairs
than those captured in UMLS were extracted from MEDLINE
sentences (Table 2). The extracted D-M pairs proved to be highly
accurate (precision of 0.924), based on our manual evaluation of
1000 randomly selected pairs.

5.3 D-M pairs positively correlate with disease drug
treatments

To show the potential of this disease phenotypic knowledge in
drug repurposing, we analysed the correlations between D-M
pairs and disease-associated drugs. In addition, we also com-
pared these correlations with those for D-M pairs in the
UMLS. A total of 2832 diseases (CUIs) were mapped from the
extracted D-M pairs to diseaseidrug treatment pairs extracted
from ClinicalTrials. gov. For diseases that appeared in both data-
sets, there are 4008 696 possible diseasewlisease combinations
(order ignored). As shown in Figure 3, the number of shared
drugs increases as the number of shared manifestations increases.
For example, the average number of shared drugs for all these

diseasewlisease pairs sharing one or more manifestation and
21.162 for diseasewlisease pairs with at least 60 overlapping
manifestations.

Fig. 3. The correlation between D-M pairs and diseasedrug treatment
pairs

To show the comprehensiveness of the pairs extracted from
MEDLINE compared with those from UMLS, we compared the
correlations with drugs for these two datasets. For the D-M pairs
from UMLS, the correlation is much weaker. Only 193 diseases
were mapped from UMLS D-M pairs to diseasewlrug treatment
pairs, which is signiﬁcantly less when compared with the 2832
mapped diseases for D-M pairs extracted from MEDLINE. The
number of average shared drugs for all possible 18528 diseasei
disease combination pairs for these 193 mapped diseases is 0.457,
which is similar to that (0.418) for pairs extracted from
MEDLINE. Among the 18 528 diseasewlisease pairs, 2471
pairs shared at least one manifestation. The average number of
shared drugs for these pairs is 0.564, a modest 23.4% increase
compared with 0.418 for all pairs, but a signiﬁcant decrease from
the 1.067 for pairs extracted from MEDLINE. Data was not
plotted because there are not many diseasewlisease pairs sharing
two or more manifestations for pairs from UMLS; only 80 pairs
shared two or more manifestations and 8 pairs shared three or
more, which prevented further correlation analysis. In summary,
diseasewlisease pairs with overlapping manifestations tend to
share drug treatments. This correlation is much stronger for
pairs extracted from MEDLINE than those from UMLS.
Even though this positive correlation between D-M and

diseaseidrug treatments is expected, this expected result demon-
strates that we can use this dataset in subsequent phenotype-
driven drug repurposing. Currently, we are developing systems
approaches to analysing this information with the goal of repur-
posing existing drugs to treat new diseases.

5.4 D—M pairs positively correlate with disease-associated
genes

To demonstrate the potential of the extracted phenotypic D-M
associations in facilitating our understanding of disease genetic
mechanisms, we analysed the correlation between the extracted
D-M pairs with disease-associated genes. We used two disease
gene association knowledge sources: diseaseigene associations
from OMIM (Hamosh et al., 2005) and disease or traitiSNP
associates from the GWAS Catalog (Hindorff et al., 2012). A
total of 1191 diseases were mapped from D-M pairs to disease
gene associations from OMIM. The average number of shared
genes for all possible 708 645 diseasewlisease combinations is
0.014. Among the 1191 diseases, 1179 diseases shared at least
one manifestation with other diseases. The average number of
shared genes for diseasewlisease pairs sharing one or more mani-
festations was 0.048, a 242% increase from 0.014 for all diseasei
disease pairs (Fig. 4). The number of shared genes increased as
the number of shared manifestations increased.

We observed similar, but weaker, correlations between pairs from
UMLS and diseaseigene pairs from OMIM. The average number
of shared genes for all possible 253 828 diseasewlisease combin-
ations among 713 mapped diseases was 0.003. The number
increased to 0.011 for diseasewlisease pairs sharing one or more
manifestations and to 0.102 for pairs sharing 10 or more manifest-
ations. Owing to the data limitation, few diseasewlisease pairs
shared more than 10manifestations. In summary, D-M associations
are highly correlated with underlying disease genetic components.
D-M pairs extracted from MEDLINE have broader coverage than
pairs from UMLS. Systems approaches to studying D-M relation-
ships may offer novel insights into disease genetic mechanisms.

The D-M pairs extracted from MEDLINE also showed strong
correlations with traitiSNP associations from GWAS. A total of
183 diseases from extracted pairs were mapped to traitiSNP
pairs from GWAS studies. The average number of shared
genes for all diseasewlisease combinations was 0.254. The
number modestly increased to 0.315 for pairs sharing one or
more manifestations. As the number of shared manifestations
increased, the number of shared GWAS genes increased signiﬁ-
cantly (Fig. 5). However, among D-M pairs from UMLS, only
19 diseases could be mapped to GWAS diseaseigene associations
because diseases in GWAS are often common complex diseases,
while diseases in D-M pairs from UMLS are often rare syn-
dromes. This difference limited our GWAS-based genetic correl-
ation study. This further demonstrates the importance of the
D-M knowledge base that we constructed from MEDLINE in
our understanding of common complex diseases.

and found all the diseases that shared any manifestations with
them based on the D-M pairs extracted from MEDLINE. We
then ranked the diseases based on Jaccard similarity coefﬁcient.
The Jaccard coefﬁcient measures manifestation similarity be-
tween two diseases, and is deﬁned as the size of the intersection
divided by the size of the union of two diseases’ manifestations:

Table 3 shows the top 10 most similar diseases for each given
disease. As shown in the table, the top-ranked diseases based on
manifestation similarity makes biological sense. For example, it
is known that Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder
and has many manifestations related to cardiovascular systems.
The top-ranked diseases for Marfan syndrome are either con-
nective tissue disorder (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, osteogenesis
imperfecta) or related to cardiovascular systems such as infective
endocarditis, coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, hyperten-
sion and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The top-ranked diseases
for T2DM are mainly metabolic syndromes or cardiovascular
diseases, which are well known to be genetically related to
T2D. The top-ranked diseases for PD are mainly neurological

diseases such as schizophrenia and dementia. Diseases that
shared most manifestations with colon cancer are also cancers
such as breast cancer and ovarian cancer.

These top-ranked diseasewlisease pairs also share drug indica-
tions. Among the top 10 most similar diseases to Marfan syn-
drome, many of them are cardiovascular diseases. By searching
clinical trials related to Marfan syndrome, we found several on-
going clinical trials (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCTO
1 145612?term=marfan+syndrome&rank=2 and http: / / clinical
trials. gov/ct2/ show/NCT00485368?term=marfan+ syndrome&ra
nk=5) that are investigating the efﬁcacy of losartan, atenolol and
other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, which are
mainly used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, in
patients with Marfan syndrome.

5.6 Top-ranked manifestations from MEDLINE and
from UMLS

To get a sense how manifestations in UMLS are different from
those extracted from MEDLINE, we ranked manifestations
from each data source by the number of diseases associated
with them. From 50551 D-M pairs from UMLS, we extracted
26030 manifestations associated with 2430 diseases. From the
121 356 D-M pairs from MEDLINE, we extracted 16258 mani-
festations associated with 16288 diseases. We then ranked each
manifestation by the number of its associated diseases. The top-
107ranked manifestations along with the number of associated
diseases from each data source is shown in Table 4. As shown in
the table, the manifestations (i.e. short stature, mental retard-
ation, microcephaly and low-set ear) for D-M pairs from
UMLS are mainly for congenital diseases like Down syndrome,
Celiac disease, Menkes disease and Mohr syndrome. The top-
ranked manifestations (i.e. infection, pain, hypertension and
renal failure) from MEDLINE-based D-M pairs are mainly for
chronic complex diseases such as diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid
arthritis and osteoporosis. Therefore, to gain a more complete
insight to diseasewlisease pairs that share manifestations, com-
bined phenotypic data from both data sources, which are largely
complementary to each other, are necessary.

6 DISCUSSION

We presented a large-scale and accurate relationship extraction
approach to accurately extract many D-M phenotype pairs from
MEDLINE. Majority of these extracted pairs are not captured in
existing knowledge bases.

Nevertheless, our study has several limitations: (i) We used
known D-M pairs from UMLS to learn speciﬁc syntactic pat-
terns. Among all D-M pairs (50551 before synonym expansion
and 3 499 871 pairs after synonym expansion) from UMLS, only
6899 pairs appeared in MEDLINE sentences. One possible
reason for this low presence of UMLS pairs in MEDLINE is
that most of the UMLS D-M pairs are for rare syndromes such
as DiGeorge syndrome, Machado-Joseph Syndrome and
Marfans syndrome. The D-M pairs from MEDLINE are
mainly for common complex diseases such as cardiovascular dis-
eases, neurologic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mel-
litus. Using the pairs from UMLS as prior knowledge, we
discovered D-Mispeciﬁc patterns. However, we do not know
for sure whether these patterns associated with rare syndromes
also represent typical patterns that researcher used to describe
D-M relationships (including both rare syndromes and common
complex diseases) in biomedical literature. Intuitively, D-Mispe-
ciﬁc patterns should be disease-independent and should also not

depend on how common or rare the diseases are; (ii) We only
used six manually selected patterns, though we extracted 121 359
unique D-M pairs from MEDLINE using these six patterns,
largely owing to the large size of the text corpus. Pairs will be
missed by this method if they are not associated with the selected
patterns. To further improve the recall, we need to manually
examine more top-ranked patterns and/or complement our ap-
proach with nonipattern-based approaches; (iii) Currently, we
ﬁltered extracted noun phrase pairs based on exact matching
terms in the disease lexicon. We can increase the recall of the
extracted pairs by keeping nouniphrase pairs as long as they
contain any terms from the disease lexicons as substrings. For
example, based on our current approach, D-M pair ‘Reovirus
type 3 infectioniprimary biliary cirrhosis’ is missed because term
‘Reovirus type 3 infection’ is not included in the disease lexicon.
We can modify our pattern by extracting nouniphrase pairs as
long as they contain as substrings any terms from the input dis-
ease lexicon. However, the precision will also depend on the
performance of the parser in nouniphrase boundary detection;
(iv) Our approach is limited to extraction of D-M pairs that co-
occur in the same sentences. Therefore pairs that co—occurred in
abstracts but not in the same sentences are missed. Because of the
large size of the text corpus (22 million articles so far), we expect
that important D-M pairs will be reported in sentences; (V)
We only performed a primitive correlation study between dis-
ease manifestations and disease-associated drugs and genes.
Currently, we are applying network-based systems approaches
in using the extracted D-M pairs for drug repurposing and can-
didate disease gene selection. We acknowledge that many D-M
pairs may appear only in other sources, such as patient EHRs.
Systematic extraction of diseaseiphenotype relationships from
EHRs (phenotyping of EHRs) is discussed in (Hripcsak et al.,
2013) and is one of our ongoing projects.

7 CONCLUSIONS

Computational approaches to the systematic study of disease
clinical phenotypes have great potential in drug repurposing
and in understanding disease etiology. However, the bottleneck
in such systems-based approaches is the lack of an accurate,
comprehensive and machine-understandable knowledge base of
disease clinical phenotype associations. In this study, we pre-
sented a large-scale relationship extraction approach to automat-
ically extract D-M pairs from MEDLINE. This approach is
highly accurate and the methodology of our learning and extrac-
tion approach leverages on external knowledge and involves min-
imal human effort. In total, we extracted 121359 distinct D-M
pairs from MEDLINE, the majority of which are not captured in
existing structured knowledge bases. We have shown that these
pairs are highly correlated with both disease drug treatments and
disease-associated genes. Currently, we are developing systems
approaches to the study of diseaseiphenotype relationship know-
ledge, in combination with existing genetic and proteomic data-
sets. Our study will impact the progress of drug repurposing and
facilitate a better understanding of disease candidate gene
selection.

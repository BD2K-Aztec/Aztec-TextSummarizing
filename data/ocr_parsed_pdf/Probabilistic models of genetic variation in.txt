Abstract

Motivation: Modern population genetics studies typically involve genome—wide genotyping of
individuals from a diverse network of ancestries. An important problem is how to formulate and
estimate probabilistic models of observed genotypes that account for complex population struc—
ture. The most prominent work on this problem has focused on estimating a model of admixture
proportions of ancestral populations for each individual. Here, we instead focus on modeling vari—
ation ofthe genotypes without requiring a higher—level admixture interpretation.

Results: We formulate two general probabilistic models, and we propose computationally efficient
algorithms to estimate them. First, we show how principal component analysis can be utilized to
estimate a general model that includes the well—known Pritchard—Stephens—Donnelly admixture
model as a special case. Noting some drawbacks ofthis approach, we introduce a new ’logistic fac—
tor analysis’ framework that seeks to directly model the logit transformation of probabilities under—
lying observed genotypes in terms of latent variables that capture population structure. We demon—
strate these advances on data from the Human Genome Diversity Panel and 1000 Genomes
Project, where we are able to identify SNPs that are highly differentiated with respect to structure
while making minimal modeling assumptions.

1 Introduction

One of the most important goals of modern human genetics is to ac-
curately model genome-wide genetic variation among individuals, as
it plays a fundamental role in disease gene mapping and characteriz-
ing the evolutionary history of human populations. In this article,
we develop latent variable probabilistic models and estimation
methods of genetic variation that provide allele frequency estimates
of each individual/SNP combination in the presence of arbitrarily

complex population structure. Accurate estimates of allele frequen-
cies in this setting allow for improved tests of genetic associations
with complex traits and other population genetic analyses which do
not rely on overly restricted models of population structure. For ex-
ample, the models and methods developed here provide the key esti-
mation step in the implementation of a new framework for
association testing in the presence of arbitrarily complex structure
(Song et (11., 2015). Other applications we explore here are to

identify loci differentiated with respect to structure, test for random
mating in the presence of structure, generalize the estimation of PST,
and characterize the global distribution of allele frequencies of dis—
ease SNPs—all making minimal assumptions about the complexity
and form of structure.

A longstanding problem has been to provide well—estimated
probabilistic models of observed genotypes in the presence of com—
plex population structure (see Raj et al., 2014 and references
therein). A series of influential publications have proposed methods
to estimate a model of admixture, where the primary focus is on the
admixture proportions themselves (Alexander et al., 2009; Pritchard
et al., 2000; Tang et al., 2005), which in turn may produce estimates
of the allele frequencies of every genetic marker for each individual.
Here, we significantly relax the assumptions made about the mani—
festation of structure to yield more general latent variable models of
structure. Rather than targeting admixture proportions, we instead
focus on the estimation of the individual-speciﬁc allele frequencies,
and we show that we make significant gains over existing methods
in the accuracy and computational efficiency in estimating these
quantities. The individual—specific allele frequencies, rather than ad—
mixture proportions, are ultimately the key quantities that need to
be estimated in the applications we discuss as well as in the associ—
ation testing method of Song et al. (2015).

We propose two flexible genome—wide models of individual—
specific allele frequencies as well as methods to estimate them. First,
we develop a model that includes as special cases the aforemen—
tioned models; specifically, the Balding—Nichols (BN) model
(Balding and Nichols, 1995) and its extension to the Pritchard—
Stephens—Donnelly (PSD) model (Pritchard et al., 2000). However,
we identify some limitations of our method to estimate this model.
We therefore propose a second model based on the log—likelihood of
the data that allows for rapid estimation of allele frequencies while
maintaining a valid probabilistic model of genotypes.

The estimate of the first model is based on principal component
analysis (PCA), which is a tool often applied to genome—wide data
of genetic variation in order to uncover structure. One of the earliest
applications of PCA to population genetic data was carried out by
Menozzi et al. (1978). Exploratory analysis of complex population
structure with PCA has been thoroughly studied (Manni, 2010;
Menozzi et al., 1978; Novembre and Stephens, 2008; Rendine et al.,
1999; Sokal et al., 1999). We show that a particular application of
PCA can also be used to estimate allele frequencies in highly struc—
tured populations, although we have to deal with the fact that PCA
is a real—valued operation and is not guaranteed to produce allele
frequency estimates that lie in the unit interval [0,1].

The estimate of the second model is based on generalized factor
analysis approaches that directly model latent structure in observed
data, including categorical data (Bartholomew et al., 2011) in
which genotypes are included. We utilize a factor model of popula—
tion structure (Engelhardt and Stephens, 2010) in terms of non—
parametric latent variables, and we propose a method called ‘logis—
tic factor analysis” (LFA) that extends the PCA perspective toward
likelihood—based probabilistic models and statistical inference
(Collins et al., 2002). LFA is shown to provide accurate and inter—
pretable estimates of individual—specific allele frequencies for a wide
range of population structures. At the same time, this proposed ap—
proach provides visualizations and numerical summaries of struc—
ture similar to that of PCA, building a convenient bridge from
exploratory data analysis to probabilistic modeling. LFA plays a
key role in the aforementioned new test of genome—wide associ—
ation of Song et al. (2015), called the genotype—conditional associ—
ation test.

We compare our proposed methods with existing algorithms,
ADMIXTURE (Alexander et al., 2009) and fastSTRUCTURE (Raj
et al., 2014), and show that when the goal is to estimate all
individual—specific allele frequencies, our proposed approaches are
conclusively superior in both accuracy and computational speed.
We apply the proposed methods to the Human Genome Diversity
Project (HGDP) (Cann et al., 2002; Rosenberg et al., 2002, 2005)
and 1000 Genomes Project (TGP) (1000 Genomes Project
Consortium, 2010) datasets, which allows us to estimate allele fre—
quencies of every SNP in an individual—specific manner. Using LFA,
we are also able to rank SNPs for differentiation according to popu—
lation structure based on the likelihoods of the fitted models. In
both datasets, the most differentiated SNP is proximal to SLC24A5,
and the second most differentiated SNP is proximal to EDAR.
Variation in both of these genes has been hypothesized to be under
positive selection in humans. In the TGP dataset, the second most
different SNP is rs3827760, which confers a missense mutation in
EDAR and has been recently experimentally validated as having a
functional role in determining a phenotype (Kamberov et al., 2013).
We also identify several SNPs that are highly differentiated in these
global human studies that have recently been associated with dis—
eases such as cancer, obesity and asthma.

2 Methods

2.1 Models of Allele Frequencies

It is often the case that human and other outbred populations are
‘structured’ in the sense that the genotype frequencies at a particular
locus are not homogeneous throughout the population (Astle and
Balding, 2009). Geographic characterizations of ancestry often ex—
plain differing genotype frequencies among subpopulations. For ex—
ample, an individual of European ancestry may receive a particular
genotype according to a probability different than an individual of
Asian ancestry. This phenomenon has been observed not only across
continents, but on very fine scales of geographic characterizations of
ancestry. Recent studies have shown that population structure in
human populations is quite complex, occurring more on a continu—
ous rather than a discrete basis (Rosenberg et al., 2002). We can
illustrate the spectrum of structural complexity with Figure 1, which
shows dendrograms of hierarchically clustered individuals from the
HapMap (phase II), HGDP and TGP datasets. The HapMap sam—
ples strongly indicate explicit membership of each individual to one
of three discrete subpopulations (due to the intended sampling
scheme). On the other hand, the clusterings of the HGDP and TGP
individuals show a very complex configuration, more representative
of random sampling of global human populations.

Let us introduce Z as an unobserved variable capturing an indi—
vidual’s structure, which we will estimate with dimension d. Let
x,, be the observed genotype for SNP i and individual /'
(i : 1, . . . ,m, j : 1. . . . .n), and assume that x,, is coded to take the
values 0, 1, 2. We call the observed m X n genotype matrix X. For
SNP i, the allele frequency can be viewed as a function of Z, i.e.
71,-(Z). For a sampled individual / from an overall population, we
have ‘individual—specific allele frequencies” (Thornton et al., 2012)
defined as 71,-,- E rt,- at SNP 1'. Each value of 71,, informs us as to the
expectation of that particular SNP/individual pair under the scen—
ario we observed a new individual at that locus with the same struc—
ture, specifically as ijiyj / 2 : 71,). If an observed SNP genotype x,, is
treated as a random variable, then we assume that 71,, serves to
model x,, as a Binomial parameter: x,,~(z : z; N Binomial(2, ni(z;)).
(We will drop the conditioning on Z in the subsequent text for

which is essentially an extension of non—parametric factor analysis
to {0, 1, 2}—valued genotype data. The justification for LFA derives
from that of generalized linear models (MeCuIIagh and Nelder,
1989), where in our case observed covariates are instead replaced
with unobserved latent variables that must also be estimated.

The log—likelihood is the preferred mathematical framework for
representing the information the data contain about unknown par—
ameters (Lehmann and Casella, 1998). Suppose that the model as—
sumption holds such that xi; ~ Binomial(2,niy). We can write the
log—likelihood of the data for SNP i and individual i as:

{(715,} (xii) : log (Pr(x,~,~)n,~,~)>

(X log(TE-;l/(1 _ Evy-xv) : xijlog<1 filing) + Zlog(1 — 715,7).
11

 

The log—likelihood of SNP i for all unrelated individuals is the sum:
27:1 [(715 (xii). The term log (13,”) is the logit function and is written
as logit(7ti;). logit(7ti;) is called the ‘natural parameter” or ‘canonical
parameter” of the Binomial distribution and is the key component of
logistic regression (MeCuIIagh and Nelder, 1989). An immediate

benefit of working with logit(7t,-,-) is that it is real valued, which

 

allows us to directly model logit(niy) with a linear basis.
Let L be the m X 11 matrix with (i, /) entry equal to I0git(7‘£,‘,‘). We
form the following parameterization of L:

Mode12 : L : AH, (2)

where A is m X d and H is d X n with d g n. In this case we can write
d
108M757) : Z dire/912;)
12:1

where all parameters are free to span the real numbers. We choose
the value of d by identifying the one that provides the best goodness—
of—fit (Supplementary materials, Section 52).

We call the rows of H ‘logistic latent factors” or just ‘logistic fac—
tors” as they represent unobserved variables that explain the inter—
individual differences in allele frequencies. In other words, the logit
of the vector of individual—specific allele frequencies for SNP i can
be written as a linear combination of the rows of H:

d
IlOgIt(7Ti1)7 - - - Ilogiﬂﬂmﬂ : logit(ﬁi) : Edi/2,7127
12:1

where bk is the kth row of H. Similarly, we can write:

exp [2:1 aikhk]

1 + exp [21:1 aikhk] ”

The relationship between our proposed LFA approach and existing

(nib-“771111): 775i :

approaches of estimating latent variables in categorical data is de—
tailed in Supplementary materials, Section 56. Specifically, it should
be noted that even though we propose calling the approach LFA, we
do not make any assumptions about the distribution of the factors
(which are often assumed to be normal). A technically more detailed
name of the method is a ‘logistic nonparametric linear latent vari—
able model for Binomial data.”

2.2 Estimation algorithms

The two models presented earlier make minimal assumptions as to
the nature of the structure. For example, in Model 1, both P and S are
permitted to be real valued. This allows us to apply a PCA—based

algorithm directly to the genotype matrix X, obtaining estimates
of E, E and S. In essence, E is estimated by forming the projection of
X/ 2 onto the top d principal components of X with an explicit inter—
cept for the d : 1 case. One drawback of this approach is that because
PCA is designed for continuous data, we have to take additional steps
to constrain E to be in the range [0, 1]. However, we show in Results
that E is still an extremely accurate estimate of the allele frequencies F
for all formulations of F considered here, including the PSD model.

Algorithm 1: Estimating F from PCA:

1. Let [4,- be the sample mean of row i of X. Set x;- : xi; — [4,- and let
X" be the m X 11 matrix with (i, /) entry 

2. Perform singular value decomposition (SVD) on X" which de—
composes X" : UAVT. Note that the rows of AVT are the n
row—wise principal components of X" and U are the principal
component loadings.

3. Let X;_1 be the projection of X" on the top d — 1 eigen—vectors

4. ConstructF by adding it,- to row i ofXd_1 (for i : 1, . . . ,n) and
multiplying the resulting matrix by 1/2. In mathematical terms,

of F*.

5. Since it may be the case that some it; are such that it; < 0 or
it; > 1, we truncate these. The final PCA based estimate of F is
formed as E where the (i, /) entry 775,; is deﬁned to be

for some C 2 0. An estimate of L can be formed as L : logit(E).
Here we used C : i, which is the minimum resolution of the data
given 211 alleles are observed. In summary, E is a projection of X
into its top principal components, scaled by 1/2, and truncated so
that all values lie in the interval (0, 1).

For Model 2, we propose a method for estimating the latent vari—
able H. Starting from the output of Algorithm 1, we apply the logit
transformation to the subset of rows that had no truncation, i.e. no

values where it; 3 C or it; 2 1 — C. We then extract the right singu—
lar vectors of this transformed subset. As long as the subset is large
enough to span the same space as the row space of L, this approach
accurately estimates the basis of H. Next, we calculate the max—
imum likelihood estimation of A parameterized by H to yield A,
and then set L :  This involves performing a logistic regression
of each SNP”s data on H. In order to estimate the individual—specific
allele frequency matrix F, we calculate F : logit_1  An important
property to note is that all 11,; 6 [0,1] due to the fact that we are

culate L5 : logit(Fs). Let L5, be the row—wise mean centered

4. Perform SVD on L5, resulting in L5, : TAWT. Set H to be the

PCA—based estimation of Model 1 requires one application of
SVD and LFA requires two applications of SVD. We leverage the
fact that 11 > d to utilize Lanczos bidiagonalization which is an it—
erative method for computing the SVD of a matrix (Baglama and
Reichel, 2006). Lanczos bidiagonalization excels at computing a

few of the largest singular values and corresponding singular vectors
of a sparse matrix. While the sparsity of genotype matrices is fairly
low, we find that in practice using this method to perform the above
estimation algorithms is more effective than using methods that re—
quire the calculation of all the singular values and vectors. This re—
sults in a substantial reduction of the computational time needed for
the implementation of our methods.

3 Results

We applied our methods to a comprehensive set of simulation stud—
ies and to the HGDP and TGP datasets.

3.1 Simulation studies

To directly evaluate the performance of the estimation methods (see
Section 2.2), we devised a simulation study where we generated syn—
thetic genotype data with varying levels of complexity in population
structure. Genotypes were simulated based on allele frequencies sub—
ject to structure from the BN model, the PSD model, spatially struc—
ture populations and real datasets. For the first three types of
simulations, the allele frequencies were parameterized by Model 1,
while for the real—data simulations, the allele frequencies were taken
from model fits on the data themselves.

A key property to assess is how well the estimation methods cap—
ture the overall structure. One way to evaluate this is to determine
how well 8 from the PCA—based method (Algorithm 1) estimates the
true underlying S, and similarly how well H from LFA estimates the
true H. Note that even though the genotype data were generated from
the F of Model 1, we can evaluate H by converting with L : logit(F).
To evaluate PCA, we regressed each row of F on S and calculated the
average R2; similarly, for LFA we regressed each row of L on H and
calculated the average R2 value. The results are presented in Table 1.
Both methods estimate the true latent structure well.

4 Discussion

We have investigated two latent variable models of population
structure to simultaneously estimate all individual—specific allele fre—
quencies from genome—wide genotyping data. Model 1, a direct
model of allele frequencies, can be estimated by using a modified
PCA and Model 2, a model of the logit transformation of allele fre—
quencies, is estimated through a new approach we called LFA. For
both models, the latent variables are estimated in a non—parametric
fashion, meaning we do not make any assumptions about the under—
lying structure captured by the latent variables. These models are
general in that they allow for each individual”s genotype to be gener—
ated from an allele frequency specific to that individual, which in—
cludes discretely structured populations, admixed populations and
spatially structured populations. In LFA, we construct a model of
the logit of these allele frequencies in terms of underlying factors
that capture the population structure. We have proposed a computa—
tionally efficient method to estimate this model that requires only
two applications of SVD. This approach builds on the success of
PCA in that we are able to capture population structure in terms of
a low—dimensional basis. It improves on PCA in that the latent vari—
ables we estimate can be straightforwardly incorporated into down—
stream statistical inference procedures that require well—behaved
estimates of allele frequencies. In particular, statistical inferences of
Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium, PST, and marker—trait associations are
amenable to complex population structures within our framework.

We demonstrated our proposed approach on the HGDP and
TGP datasets and several simulated datasets motivated by the
HapMap, HGDP and TGP datasets as well as the PSD model and
spatially distributed structures. It was shown that our method esti—
mates the underlying logistic factors with a high degree of accuracy.
We also showed that applying PCA to genotype data estimates a
row basis of population structure on the original allele frequency
scale to a high degree of accuracy. However, problems occur when
trying to recover estimates of individual—specific allele frequencies
because PCA is a real—valued model that does not always result in al—
lele frequency estimates lying between 0 and 1.

Although PCA has become very popular for genome—wide genotype
data, it should be stressed that PCA is fundamentally a method for
characterizing variance and special care should be taken when applying
it to estimate latent variables. The authoritative treatment of PCA
(Jolliffe, 2010) eloquently makes this point throughout the text and
considers cases where factor analysis is more appropriate than PCA
through examples reminiscent of the population structure problem.
Here, we have shown that modeling and estimating population struc—
ture can be understood from the factor analysis perspective, leading to
estimates of individual—specific allele frequencies through their natural
parameter on the logit scale. At the same time, we have avoided some
of the difficulties of traditional parametric factor analysis by maintain—
ing the relevant non—parametric properties of PCA, specifically in mak—
ing no assumptions about the underlying probability distributions of
the logistic factors that capture population structure.

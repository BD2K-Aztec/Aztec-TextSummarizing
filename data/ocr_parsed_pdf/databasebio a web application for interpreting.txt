Abstract

Summary: Rapid advances of next—generation sequencing technology have led to the integration
of genetic information with clinical care. Genetic basis of diseases and response to drugs provide
new ways of disease diagnosis and safer drug usage. This integration reveals the urgent need for
effective and accurate tools to analyze genetic variants. Due to the number and diversity of sources
for annotation, automating variant analysis is a challenging task. Here, we present database.bio, a
web application that combines variant annotation, prioritization and visualization so as to support
insight into the individual genetic characteristics. It enhances annotation speed by preprocessing
data on a supercomputer, and reduces database space via a unified database representation with

compressed fields.

1 Introduction

The decreasing cost of sequencing technologies and growing know—
ledge in the clinical relevance of genomic data have led to rapid adop—
tion of genetic tests in healthcare (Feero et (11., 2011). While huge
amount of data is generated through these tests, the management and
analysis of these data present many challenges as discussed here after.
Variant annotations come from diverse sources, which may not use
the same coordinate system and naming convention. Once annota—
tions have been integrated, these database files consume large storage
space and queries to the databases can be very slow without proper
indexing and preprocessing. Existing tools have solved some of the
stated issues but are lacking in other features. For example, some soft—
ware can visualize records from different databases across the gen—
ome, such as the UCSC genome browser (Kent et (11., 2002) and

Alamut Visual 2.4 (Interactive Biosoftware; last accessed August 5,
2014). However, it is hard to display all relevant annotations, such as
relationships between genes and pathways, by only using a genome
browser. Moreover, the scale of genome browsers is usually small as
they are designed to show information of small genomic regions. It is
also not possible for users to sort or filter variants in the browser. In
contrast, tables can better summarize variant information and help
users prioritize their findings. QIAGEN’s Ingenuity Variant Analysis
software (IVA) (www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) is a popular table—based
tool and allows users to configure a filter cascade for data prioritiza—
tion. However, without an embedded genome browser, it is incon—
venient for users to picture genomic characteristics of variants and
study—related data from databases integrated in IVA. A similar tool,

2015), combines HTML pages and Browse (Skinner et (11., 2009) to
display sample details but does not provide detailed disease annota—
tions. Here, we present database.bio, a web application that integrates
five key elements (variants, genes, diseases, drugs and pathways) and
assigns severity levels to variants using customizable categorization
rules. Variant information is presented in HTML pages that contain
annotation details with a powerful embedded genome browser, allow—
ing clinicians and researchers to carry out analysis of genomic
sequencing data in a highly configurable manner. Twenty—nine public
databases are used to generate variant annotations including variant
functional prediction, variant conservation, splicing prediction, regu—
latory feature prediction, pharmacogenomics information with dis—
ease and drug, real sample data such as 1000G, TCGA, ICGC and
LOVD, as well as clinical trial details.

When developing a web tool for variant interpretation, it is im—
portant to ensure that patient data are retrieved and managed over
the web in a secure manner. database.bio is built strictly adhering to
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),
which is a stringent standard for privacy and security.

2 Materials and Methods

In database.bio, variant information is retrieved from different
databases based on join conditions such as genomic positions,
gene—drug, gene—disease and gene—pathway relationships. To unify
the coordinate scheme of databases (see Supplementary Methods
for details), sequence changes at RNA level are converted to DNA
level using the Mutalyzer Position Converter (http://www.LOVD.
nl/mutalyzer/). In addition, the left—aligned HGVS G—dot notation
is adopted while diseases, drugs, and pathways are linked to
related genes using the HGNC symbol (Supplementary Fig. S1). In
order to allow users to access the original data from which annota—
tion is derived, hyperlinks to the original data source are often
provided.

Annotation is a very time—consuming part of data processing.
In order to reduce annotation time, preprocessing is performed to
generate annotation of all possible human single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) variants at each genomic position.
Afterwards, annotation information for any individual case can be
retrieved quickly. There are ~8.6 billion possible human SNP vari—
ants to be preprocessed; using state—of—the—art annotators such as
VEP would require over a 100 000 CPU hours. To this end, we
used a supercomputer with 1000 nodes. The annotation informa—
tion used by database.bio were fetched from more than 25 curated
databases (see Supplementary Methods for details): (i) databases
for variant annotation, (ii) databases for gene annotation and (iii)
databases for real samples, such as ICGC (Zhang et (11., 2011) and
TCGA (The TCGA Research Network. http://cancergenome.nih.
gov). As the data size in database.bio is very large, it is time—con—
suming to check the three key fields (chromosome, genomic pos—
ition and nucleotide change) for every query. Moreover, the size of
index files can be large when multiple fields are indexed, lowering
query performance. For some large tables in database.bio, these
three key fields are merged into an integer by bitvvise operations,
which result in smaller index files and faster query speed
(Supplementary Materials).

3 Visualization

We used eight tools (see Supplementary Methods for details) to
generate visualizations of various statistical properties of the input

variant list. These tools include Circos (Krzywinski et (11., 2009)
and BCFtools (Li, 2011). We have also built our own genome
viewer, named Genome Browser, which consolidates and displays
information from most of the relevant databases in one single
viewer. For a specified genomic region, the Genome Browser
displays annotation details such as variant, gene and orthology
information of human and 14 other mammals from related data—
bases. In addition to data derived from VCF files, content from
SNAPSHOT (Luo et (11., 2014) files and alignment details from
BAM files can also be plotted (Fig. 1).

In order to visualize the effect of variants on protein structures,
protein—domain graphs and 3D structures of proteins with affected
amino acid highlighted are provided. Similarly, pathway graphs
with mutated gene highlighted are generated for each affected
molecular pathway.

4 Usage

Database.bio accepts input in VCF, 23andMe, BAM, and
SNAPSHOT formats. After authentication, users can browse, delete
existing analyses or upload new files. On the variant upload page,
users can augment the default categorization rules to prioritize the
variants (Fig. 2) with a user—friendly filtering cascade to give higher
priority in view of user—interested genes, population statistics and bio—
logical consequences. The customizable filtering cascade allows users
to focus on a small number of variants based on different criteria. The
categorization rules are similar to the Emory Genetic Laboratory’s
classification definitions (Bean et (11., 2013), which rely on terms such
as consequence—of—variants and clinical—significance—type from dbSNP
and EVS. In addition, we considered relationships among genes,
genetic disorders, clinical significance (as defined in ClinVar), pre—
dicted categories from CADD and Align—GVGD prediction in formu—
lating the categorization rules. The variants are then filtered based on
user—defined filters and prioritized through classification based on
associated disease information.

After annotated data are uploaded and processed, each vari—
ant is categorized into one of five severity levels (pathogenic,
likely—pathogenic, Variant of Unknown Significance (VOUS),
likely benign and benign). Per—column sorting and searching are
also available. The variant count in each severity level is given in
table entries on the Gene, Disease, Drug and Pathway Summary
pages. The Genome Browser is embedded in the Variant Detail
and Gene Detail pages. Details of samples from TCGA or ICGC
with related variants are shown on the Variant Details and
Disease Details pages. Furthermore, clinical trial records of dis—
eases and drugs are provided on the Disease Detail and Drug
Detail pages. These features can help researchers to efficiently in—
tegrate variant related information and form a whole picture of
their data more quickly.

5 Conclusion

Database.bio, empowered by a space—efficient integration of diverse
sources of annotations, provides an efficient way for interpreting
human genomic variations and supports interactive visualization. As
database.bio is a web—based application, the way users retrieve and
manage data have been specially designed to ensure a security level
up to the standard of HIPAA.

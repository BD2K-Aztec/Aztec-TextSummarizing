Analysis of base-pairing probabilities

 

systematically analyzed (see Section 3). In the analysis, we
tried three probabilistic models of RNA secondary structure
(Section 2.4), including the McCaskill model based on Turner’s
energy model (Mathews et al., 1999), when computing BPPs, and
conﬁrmed that our results are consistently supported.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Datasets

For a dataset of proteiniRNA complexes, we used 91 complexes created
in a previous study (Iwakiri et al., 2012). In this dataset, modiﬁed
nucleotides are deleted and the complexes containing multiple RNA
chains are excluded because the calculation of the BPP is limited to
standard nucleotides and single-stranded RNAs. The resulting dataset
has 68 complexes comprising 2688 nucleotides.

The above dataset includes 27 tRNAs whose secondary structures are
structurally similar despite the low similarity between their primary
sequences. To avoid this population bias, we created another dataset in
which a representative tRNA-related complex (PDBID: lASY) was ran-
domly selected for our analysis. The resulting dataset has 42 complexes,
comprising 1098 nucleotides.

2.2 Identification of base pairs involved in RNA
3D structures

To be consistent with the deﬁnition of a base pair that is used in the
calculation of the BPP, canonical Watson£rick pairs (AiU and G£)
and wobble pairs (GiU) are treated as base pairs. These base pairs are
extracted from each RNA tertiary structure using the RNAview program
(Yang et al., 2003). Nucleotides forming a base pair were categorized as
paired nucleotides, and the remaining nucleotides were categorized as
unpaired nucleotides. Note that our deﬁnitions of paired and unpaired
nucleotides are based on tertiary structures in the PDB.

2.3 Identification of intermolecular hbonds in the
protein—RNA interface

In the proteiniRNA complexes, amino acids and nucleotides are
identiﬁed as the interface residues if their closest atomiatom distances
are <5.0 A. Intermolecular hbonds between proteins and RNAs were
identiﬁed using HBPLUS programs with default settings (the donori
acceptor distance is <3.9 A, the hydrogeniacceptor distance is <2.5 A,
angles of donorihydrogeniacceptor (DHiA) and donoriacceptori
acceptor antecedents (DiAiAA) are >900) (McDonald and Thornton,
1994). It should be noted that sugar and Hoogsteen edges and phosphate
groups are available to form an intermolecular hbond with amino acids
even if the nucleotides form base pairs using WatsoniCrick edges
(i.e. they are paired nucleotides) (Leontis and Westhof, 2001).

2.4 BPPs for RNA sequences

Given an RNA sequence X, a BPP 17,-) (i < j) is equal to the probability
that the ith and jth nucleotides of X, X,- and X), form a base pair (in an
assumed ensemble of RNA secondary structures). This probability is
formally deﬁned by the marginal probability.

1,, 2 Z 1(e,j=1>p(elx) (1)

aesm

where p(6|X) is a probability distribution on the set 8(X) of possible sec-
ondary structures of the RNA sequence X, and the indicator [(6,1- = 1)
becomes 1 only when the secondary structure 6 includes the base pair
(Xi, Xj).

In Equation (1), the probability distribution p(6|X) is often given by the
Boltzmann distribution [when it is called the McCaskill model

(McCaskill, 1990)], which is based on experimentally determined
parameters:

 

17(9lx) = ﬁexp (5%”)

where E(6, X) is the free energy of the RNA secondary structure
6 computed by using Turner’s energy parameters (Mathews et al.,
1999), Z(X) is the normalizing constant (partition function), R is
the ideal gas constant [8.314 J/(K mol)] and T is temperature
(T = 37°C 2 310K was used in this study).

We also tried two machine-learning-based models as the distribution
p(6|X): the Boltzmann likelihood (BL) model (Andronescu et al., 2010)
and the CONTRAfold model (Do at al., 2006). In these models, internal
parameters are automatically learned from known RNA secondary struc-
tures; in other words, those models do not use experimentally determined
parameters. It should be emphasized that recent studies have suggested
that machine learning-based models achieve better performance than the
energy-based model with respect to the prediction of base pairs in RNA
secondary structures (Andronescu et al., 2010; Do at al., 2006; Hamada
et al., 2009).

The complete set of BPPs {pithKJ-(W called a BPP matrix (BPPM),
can be efﬁciently computed by the insidewutside algorithm. See, for
example, McCaskill (1990) for the details. We used the CentroidFold
software (Hamada et al., 2009) to compute the BPPM for each probabil-
istic model. (See Supplementary Section S1 for the detailed command line
options.)

Finally, a BPP (denoted by q,-) for a speciﬁc single position i in the
RNA sequence X is deﬁned by

qt» = 21717 + Zn;- (2)
j:j<i j:i< j
which gives the probability that the nucleotide at position i in X is part of

a base pair. In our study, we use the BPPs of Equation (2) for each
nucleotide in an RNA sequence.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this study, each nucleotide was categorized into four types
based on the combination of intermolecular hbonds and base
pairs in the 3D structures: (i) paired nucleotides with intermo—
lecular hbonds; (ii) paired nucleotides without intermolecular
hbonds; (iii) unpaired nucleotides with intermolecular hbonds;
and (iv) unpaired nucleotides without intermolecular hbonds. In
Supplementary Table S1, we summarize the detailed numbers of
nucleotides in each category in the dataset.

The average BPPs for the unpaired nucleotides with forming
intermolecular hbonds were signiﬁcantly lower than those for the
nucleotides without hbonds (Fig. 1a). On the other hand, no
difference was found between the BPPs of paired nucleotides
with and without intermolecular hbonds (Fig. 1b). In the detailed
distributions of the BPPs for the four types of nucleotides
(Fig. 2), only the unpaired nucleotides with low BPPs (<0.l)
were frequently found when the nucleotides were involved in
intermolecular hbonds (Fig. 2a). In contrast, unpaired nucleo—
tides with relatively high BPPs (30.1) were rarely found when the
nucleotides were involved in the hbonds (Fig. 2a), whereas such
nucleotides were more frequently found when the nucleotides
were not involved in the hbonds (Fig. 2b). In addition, similar
distributions were observed under the other two probabilistic
models (BL and CONTRAfold) for calculating the BPPs
(Supplementary Figs S1 and S3). These differences in the

Fig. 3. Percentages of paired and unpaired nucleotides forming intermo—
lecular hbonds in 68 proteiniRNA complexes. Unpaired nucleotides are
divided into two groups based on their BPPs calculated by using the
McCaskill model: strong tendency to become unpaired (BPP 5 0.1) or
not (BPP >0.1). Paired nucleotides are also divided into two groups:
strong tendency to become paired (BPP >09) or not (BPP 5 0.9). See

intermolecular hbonds with proteins than unpaired nucleotide
with higher BPPs. The importance of the unpaired nucleotides
for interacting with proteins is consistently shown in recent
studies (Gupta and Gribskov. 2011; Iwakiri el (1].. 2012). In add-
ition. our results suggest that investigating the emenible of the
secondary structures of the RNA is also important in the pro-
teiniRNA interactions. especially for the unpaired nucleotides.

A previous study suggested that. when using the McCaskill
model. BPPs [Equation (1)] of two nucleotides that do not
form a base pair in the reference structure are often high. falling
in the range 0.971 [see Supplementary Fig. 513 in Hamada el al.
(2009)]. Interestingly. a similar tendency was not observed for
unpaired nucleotides with intermolecular hbonds. whereas it
was observed for unpaired nucleotides without hbonds (see
Fig. 2a and b). which also supports the idea that unpaired
nucleotides with hbonds have a strong tendency to become
unpaired in the ensemble of RNA secondary structures.

Our dataset used above included 27 complexes containing vari-
ous tRNAs. The secondary structures of these tRNAs are known
to be a similar cloverleaf structure. even though their primary
sequences are not similar. To avoid the bias of the tRNA. a subset
containing 42 complexes including a representative tRNA
(PDBID: lASY) was also created (Supplementary Table S2).
This subset was then used to calculate the BPPs based on the
three different models (Supplementary Figs S5751 1). These res tilts
also showed that the BPPs of the unpaired nucleotides were low
when the nucleotides were involved in intermolecular hbonds.

Finally. we investigated a discriminative power of the BPP for
predicting the RNA residues either forming intermolecular
hbond or not forming the bonds (Supplementary Fig. 512). As
anticipated from the previous results. moderate discriminative
power was observed for the case of unpaired nucleotides
(Supplementary Fig. 513). whereas no discriminative power
was seen for the case of paired nucleotides (Supplementary
Fig. 514). Note that there was no signiﬁcant difference of the

powers among probabilistic models for RNA secondary
structures.

In future work. we plan to incorporate these results into
proteiniRNA computational docking (Huang and Zou. 2013)
or predicting the potential interface of proteiniRNA complexes
(Lewis el (1].. 2011) because our study provides novel and useful
information about the nucleotides (of RNAs) that form intermo-
lecular hbonds with the proteins.

4 CONCLUSION

In this study. we analyzed BPPs of RNAs involved in known
proteiniRNA interactions (complexes). Our findings are sum-
marized as follows: (i) Within unpaired nucleotides average}
distribution of BPPs with intermolecular nucleotides. hbond is
different from those without hbond (Figs 1 and 2a and 2b). This
difference is useful for discrimination between the unpaired
nucleotides with hbonds and those without hbonds
(Supplementary Fig. 513). (ii) Within paired nucleotides. aver-
ageseldistribution of BPPs with hbond is not different from those
without hbond (Figs 1 and 2c and 2d). Hence. BPPs are not
useful to discriminate the paired nucleotides with hbonds from
those without hbonds (Supplementary Fig. 514). To our know-
ledge. this is the first study that considers the ensemble of RNA
secondary structures in the analysis of proteiniRNA inter-
actions. The findings in this study would be useful when develop-
ing an algorithm for proteiniRNA computational docking and
predicting the potential interface of proteiniRNA complexes.

ABSTRACT

SUMMARY: Large volumes of data generated by high-throughput
sequencing instruments present non-trivial challenges in data
storage, content access and transfer. We present G-SQZ, a Huffman
coding-based sequencing-reads-specific representation scheme
that compresses data without altering the relative order. G-SQZ has
achieved from 65% to 81% compression on benchmark datasets,
and it allows selective access without scanning and decoding from
start. This article focuses on describing the underlying encoding
scheme and its software implementation, and a more theoretical
problem of optimal compression is out of scope. The immediate
practical benefits include reduced infrastructure and informatics
costs in managing and analyzing large sequencing data.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput sequencing methods and instruments (Ansorge,
2009; Mardis, 2008; Shendure and Ji, 2008) generate hundreds-
of- millions to billions of short reads. Storage, management and
transfer of such large volumes of data necessitate an order of
magnitude more infrastructure capabilities. Algorithms and software
are required to analyze terabytes of data within practical constraints
of resources, such as computer processors, memory, storage, time,
etc., and have to cope with the new challenge of handling very large
ﬁles containing dense data. With constantly increasing throughput,
monetary costs of processing and managing sequencing data are
becoming a larger factor in research planning. To that end, this
article proposes a lossless, order preserving and compact-encoding
scheme called Genomic SQueeZ (G-SQZ) for sequence read data
and provides a software implementation.

Typically, genomic sequencing data consists of annotated
genomic bases in their relative order. Annotation is required
due to reasons such as (i) nucleotide base calling algorithms
typically report error probability, generally called quality score,
to account for intrinsic uncertainties in sequence identiﬁcation
processes; (ii) additional information needs to be reported when
sequence identiﬁcation is inconclusive, incomplete or erroneous;
and (iii) for various downstream analyses, assigning unique

identiﬁers to sequencing reads is desirable. This overhead of storing
annotation information dramatically increases ﬁle sizes and any
storage reduction approach requires compressing both base and
annotation data.

2 METHODS

Huffman coding (Huffman. 1952) is a lossless encoding algorithm that
generates variable length codes for symbols used to represent information.
By encoding high frequency symbols with shorter codes and low frequency
symbols with longer codes. the original information is stored as much smaller
encoded data. The codes are constructed in such a way that no code is a preﬁx
of any other code. a property that enables unambiguous decoding. Within the
context of genomic sequencing data. let B={b1,b2,...,bm} denote a ﬁnite
set ofm symbols representing all possible distinct genomic bases (nucleotide.
color-space. error calls. no calls. etc.) and let Q: {111,112, . . .,q],} be a ﬁnite
set of symbols representing all distinct quality scores or other annotation
information available for each base. Since not all symbols from B and Q
might be present in a given data. let B’ EB and Q’ E Q denote the actual
symbols used. such that |B’|=m’; lfm’ 5m and |Q|=p’; lip/5p. We
construct a pair-wise symbol set S =B’ >< Q’ of size nzm’ -pl that consists of
all base-quality pairs <bi, qj >; 1), EB’, qj e Q’ in the data.

As shown in Figure l. the ﬁrst scan generates a unique Huffman code
for each <base, quality> pair from the frequency distribution of all pairs
in S. In the second scan. encoded pairs are written to a binary ﬁle. along
with a header containing meta-information. such as Huffman encoding for
each pair. platform. number of reads. etc. Additionally. the meta-characters
(‘@’. ‘+’. ‘>’. ‘_’. ‘:’. etc.) are stored only once and the differences between
successive read identiﬁers are noted. taking care that all original information
can be reproduced. Thus. the encoded ﬁle (Fig. 1) consists of a ﬁxed-length
header followed by sequence of blocks. one block per read. Information in
the header can be retrieved Via simple queries to retrieve number of reads.
base/quality statistics. sample name. etc.. and save time in parsing large ﬁles.

3 IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS

A C++ command-line implementation of G-SQZ is available
at http://public.tgen.org/sqz. Since more than 4 billion (~232)
bases per run are common, G-SQZ has been designed as
a 64-bit application. Table 1 shows comparisons with gzip
v1.3.5 and bzip2 v1.0.5 using best compression option (—9)
for both on publicly available data from the 1000 Genomes
Project (www.1000genomes.org). Tests have shown similar storage
reduction on several other data sets (data not shown), and we invite
readers to test G—SQZ on additional data. While the encoding step
for base-quality data stays the same, read identiﬁer format speciﬁc
steps have been implemented for SRA (NCBI), CSFASTA/QUAL
(LifeTechnologies) and FASTQ (Cook et al., 2009) formats. Due to
non-standardization in read-identiﬁer formats, capturing all possible
formats is a work in progress.

4 DISCUSSION

The salient features of G-SQZ are: (i) Speciﬁcally designed for
sequencing reads in known format(s) and not for arbitrary data;
(ii) implicit pairing and simultaneous encoding of base-quality data;
(iii) other than counting frequency of <base, quality> pairs, no
other string matching is employed; (iv) order of <base, quality>
data is unchanged; and (v) data can be retrieved selectively without
serial scans and decoding from the beginning, a feature that can be
utilized by multi-threaded parallel computing applications.

G-SQZ is designed for sequencing reads, unlike aligned
sequences in SAM/BAM (Li et al., 2009) formats. Since no
restriction is imposed on the number of symbols, it is possible
to include any number of distinct bases (including other IUPAC
symbols, error symbols, etc.) and larger range covering higher

resolution of quality scores. Quality values can be multi-character
strings (with known delimiters), not limited by the size of the ASCII
character set. Generating <base, quality> pair-speciﬁc Huffman
encoding offers two signiﬁcant advantages over two-bit encoding
(A=00, C=01, G: 10, T=11). For example, two-bits per base
will require 20 bits to store a 10-base sequence AAAGTAATAA,
while frequency distribution-aware variable length encoding, such
as A: 0, G = 10, T = 11, will reduce the number of bits to 13. Second,
two bits can encode at most four distinct symbols and, without
additional bits, cannot include no call, error call and quality scores.

G-SQZ offers a compact lossless indexed format to signiﬁcantly
reduce storage needed by plain text ﬁles, while allowing selective
access to any section of the data without serially scanning and
decoding from start. The compression ratio of G-SQZ primarily
depends on the relative frequencies of <base, quality> pairs. We
recognize that G-SQZ might be sub-optimal compared to other
compression algorithms employing statistical pattern matching,
such as palindromes, string comparisons, repeat detection and data
permutation (Adj eroh et al., 2002; Brandon et al., 2009; Chen et al.,
2002; Christley et al., 2009; Soliman et al., 2009). For example,
for bases AAATTGAAA and qualities FFFFFFFFF, storing <multi-
base, multi-quality> pair <AAA,FFF> instead of <A,F> is more
efﬁcient, and several such cases can be enumerated. However,
investigation of an order preserving, indexed, yet theoretically
optimal, encoding and extensive comparisons with all compression
methods is out of scope. The goal of this article is to demonstrate
the practical application of G-SQZ to a critical challenge in
bioinformatics, where throughput per run is in the range of hundreds
of Giga-bases, but the plain text data format is highly inefﬁcient. As
shown in Table 1, G-SQZ has outperformed gzip in all selected
data sets. Compared to bzip2 (a series of compression techniques
that include the Burrows—Wheeler Transform), the relatively simple
approach in G-SQZ did better in one case and came close overall
while maintaining the order, allowing selective access and storing
meta-information, e.g., number of reads/bases, for quick retrieval.

In cases of data corruption due to bit errors, G-SQZ can detect
limited number of cases where, due to corruption, an encoded string
is absent from the list of known symbols or values are out of normal
ranges. For more reliable checks, we recommend external tools (e. g.
md5). A robust error checking scheme and encoding variable length
reads (e.g., 454 data) have been left as ﬁiture work.

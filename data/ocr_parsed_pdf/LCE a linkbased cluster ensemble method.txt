ABSTRACT

Motivation: It is far from trivial to select the most effective
clustering method and its parameterization, for a particular set
of gene expression data, because there are a very large number
of possibilities. Although many researchers still prefer to use
hierarchical clustering in one form or another, this is often
sub-optimal. Cluster ensemble research solves this problem by
automatically combining multiple data partitions from different
clusterings to improve both the robustness and quality of the
clustering result. However, many existing ensemble techniques use
an association matrix to summarize sample-cluster co-occurrence
statistics, and relations within an ensemble are encapsulated only
at coarse level, while those existing among clusters are completely
neglected. Discovering these missing associations may greatly
extend the capability of the ensemble methodology for microarray
data clustering.

Results: The link-based cluster ensemble (LCE) method, presented
here, implements these ideas and demonstrates outstanding
performance. Experiment results on real gene expression and
synthetic datasets indicate that LCE: (i) usually outperforms the
existing cluster ensemble algorithms in individual tests and, overall,
is clearly class-leading; (ii) generates excellent, robust performance
across different types of data, especially with the presence of noise
and imbalanced data clusters; (iii) provides a high-level data matrix
that is applicable to many numerical clustering techniques; and (iv) is
computationally efficient for large datasets and gene clustering.

1 INTRODUCTION

The use of clustering is vital both for visualizing and extracting
useful information from microarray data. However, different
algorithms (or even the same algorithm with different parameters)
often provide distinct clusterings. As a result, it is extremely difﬁcult
for users to decide which algorithm and parameters will be optimal
for a given set of data—this is because no single-pass/simple

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

clustering algorithm can perform the best for all datasets (Kuncheva
and Hadjitodorov, 2004), and discovering all types of cluster shapes
and structures presented in data is impossible for any known
clustering algorithm (Duda et al., 2000; Handl et al., 2005).

Clinical researchers commonly use simple clustering methods,
such as agglomerative hierarchical and k-means (Bredel et al.,
2005; Sorlie et al., 2003) to cluster cancer microarray samples,
despite the advent of several new techniques that capitalize on the
inherent characteristics of gene expression data (noise and high
dimensionality) to improve clustering quality (e.g. Brunet et al.,
2004; Liu et al., 2003; McLachlan et al., 2002). de Souto et al.
(2008) says, this is because the use of such methods is difﬁcult for
non-expert users.

Recently, cluster ensembles or consensus clusterings have
emerged as simple, effective, one-stop methods for improving the
robustness and quality of clustering results. Cluster ensembles
combine multiple clustering decisions (referred to as ‘base
clusterings’ or ‘ensemble members’) where the base clusterings
contain diversity in their choice of clusters by: (i) using a single
clustering algorithm with random parameter initializations (Kim
et al., 2009; Monti et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2007); (ii) employing
multiple clustering algorithms (Swift et al., 2004); (iii) selecting
a random number of clusters (Fred and Jain, 2005; Kuncheva
and Vetrov, 2006); (iv) using different subsets of gene (Avogadri
and Valentini, 2009; Yu et al., 2007); or (v) using data sampling
techniques (Dudoit and Fridyand, 2003; Monti et al., 2003). Most
existing methods compare cluster associations between each of the
N samples in the dataset to produce an N ><N pairwise similarity
matrix [i.e. consensus (Monti et al., 2003), agreement (Swift et al.,
2004) and co-association (Fred and Jain, 2005) matrices], to which
a consensus function (e.g. agglomerative hierarchical clustering) is
applied to acquire the ﬁnal data partition. With the ensemble of
two base clusterings l'l={711,712} and ﬁve samples (x1,...x5) that
is given in Figure la, the corresponding similarity matrix is shown
in Figure lb.

An alternative approach (Fern and Brodley, 2004; Strehl and
Ghosh, 2002) to pairwise similarity methods makes use of an
N X P binary cluster-association matrix (BM) (where P denotes the
number of clusters in an ensemble). Figure 1c shows the example
of such matrix that is generated from the ensemble of Figure la.
Despite reported success and efﬁciency, these methods generate
the ultimate clustering result based on incomplete information of
a cluster ensemble. The underlying association matrix presents
sample—cluster relations at a coarse level and completely ignores
the relations among clusters (lam-on et al., 2008). As a result, the

performance of such techniques may consequently be degraded as
many matrix entries are left unknown, each presented with zero.

In response, we present a new method—the LCE—for clustering
data. It signiﬁcantly extends the hybrid bipartite graph formulation
(HBGF) technique (Fern and Brodley, 2004), by applying a graph-
based consensus function to an improved cluster association matrix,
instead of the conventional BM. This article explores its application
to the problem of clustering cancer microarray samples, and is
shown to reﬁne the cluster-association matrix, as well as reducing
the number of unknown entries and, therefore, increasing accuracy;
moreover, it can easily replace or augment a researcher’s existing
clustering tools.

2 METHODS

The proposed LCE methodology is illustrated in Figure 2. It includes
three major steps: (i) creating M base clusterings to form a cluster
ensemble; (ii) creating a reﬁned cluster-association matrix (RM) using a
link-based similarity algorithm (Weighted Connected-Triples, WCT); and
(iii) generating the ﬁnal data partition by exploiting the spectral graph
partitioning (SPEC) technique as a consensus function. This framework is
similar to that of HBGF (Fern and Brodley, 2004), except the second step
that is introduced for constructing a reﬁned information matrix. As compared
to HBGF that is based on the BM, LCE may enhance effectiveness of the
former using a more informative RM.

2.1 Creating a cluster ensemble

LetX={x1,...,xN}beasetofN samples and let II: {JTJ,...,JTM} beacluster
ensemble with M base clustering results. Each base clustering returns a set of
clusters JT,’ 2 {Ci , C5, . . . , Clii}, such that   =X, where ki is the number
of clusters in the i-th clustering.

As in many previous studies (Fred and Jain, 2005; Kim et al., 2009), the
k-means clustering algorithm is used to generate base clusterings, each with
random initialization of cluster centers. Euclidean distance is used to measure
the dissimilarity between two samples unless stated otherwise. For each
base clustering, there are two schemes of selecting the number of clusters:
Fixed-k (kzﬂ, where N is the number of samples) and Random-k (k6
{2,...,\/N}). To create diversity in an ensemble, k should be greater than
the expected number of clusters and the common rule-of—thumb is k=\/N
(Fred and J ain, 2005; Hadjitodorov et al., 2006). Note that the quality of the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fig. 2. The LCE framework: (i) a cluster ensemble I'I={Jn,...,rrM} is
created from M base clusterings; (ii) a reﬁned cluster-association matrix
(RM) is then generated from the ensemble using the WCT algorithm; and
(iii) a ﬁnal clustering result (71*) is produced by a consensus function of the
spectral graph partitioning (SPEC).

ﬁnal clustering is directly subjected to the diversity among base clusterings
(Kuncheva and Vetrov, 2006).

Another alternative to generate diversity within an ensemble is to exploit
a number of different data partitions. To this extent, the cluster ensemble is
also established on various data subspaces. Similar to the study of Yu et al.
(2007), for a given N X [1' dataset of N samples and [1' genes, an N X (1 data
subspace (where q < d) is generated by

q: 9min + L‘YWmax — 9min)l (1)

here or e [0, l] is a uniform random variable, qmin and qmax are the lower and
upper bounds of the generated subspace, respectively. In particular, qmin and
qmax are set to 0.75a’ and 0.85a’. A gene is selected one by one from the pool
of [1' genes, until the collection of q is obtained. The index of each selected
gene is determined as follows, where h denotes the h-th gene in the pool of
[1' genes and )3 e [0, l) is a uniform random variable.

h: L1+ﬁdl (2)

Generating a reﬁned cluster-association matrix (RM)

In particular to HBGF, BM has been used to summarized information
presented in an ensemble H. Each entry in this matrix BM(xi,C']-)e {0, 1}
represents a crisp association degree between sample xi EX and cluster
C]- e H. According to Figure l, which shows an example of cluster ensemble
and the corresponding BM, a large number of entries in the BM are unknown,
each presented with 0. Intuitively, this may limit the quality of a data partition
generated by any consensus function. These conditions occur when relations
between different clusters of a base clustering are originally assumed to be
nil. It is important to note that each sample can associate (to a certain degree
within [0, 1]) to several clusters of any particular clustering, at the same time.
These hidden or unknown associations can be estimated upon the similarity
among clusters, discovered from a link network of clusters.

Based on this insight, the reﬁned cluster-association matrix (RM) is
put forward as the enhanced variation of the original BM. Its aim is to
approximate value of unknown associations (‘0’) from known ones (‘1’),
whose association degrees are preserved within the RM (i.e. BM(x,», cl) = l —>
RM(x,»,cl)= 1). For each clustering Jr,,t= l...M and their corresponding
clusters Ci , . . . , C]; (where k, is the number of clusters in the clustering 71,),
the association degree RM(x,»,cl)e [0, 1] that sample xi EX has with each
cluster cl 6 {Ci , . . . , CI’Q} is estimated as follows:

1 if cl = C fk (xi)
sim(cl,Cj<(x,»)) otherwise

RM(x,», cl) = { (3)
where Ci(x,») is a cluster label (corresponding to a particular cluster of the
clustering 71,) to which the sample xi belongs. In addition, sim(CX,Cy)e
[0,1] denotes the similarity between any two clusters CX,Cy, which
can be discovered using the following link-based algorithm. Note that,
for any clustering 71, EU, lSZVCemRM(xi,C)5k,. Unlike the measure
of fuzzy membership, the typical constraint of ZVCemRM(xi,C)=l is

not appropriate for re-scaling associations within the RM. In fact, such
local normalization will signiﬁcantly distort the true semantics of known
associations (‘1’), such that their magnitudes become dissimilar, different
from one clustering to another. According to our empirical investigation,
the quality of RM is usually higher than other soft, fuzzy-like variations of
the BM, which can be obtained from sample-to-cluster distances or a fuzzy
cluster ensemble. See Supplementary Section 8.1 for details of such methods
and associated experimental results.

2.1.] WCT: a link-basea1 similarity algorithm Given a cluster ensemble
II of data samples X , a weighted graph G = (V, W) can be constructed, where
V is the set of vertices each representing a cluster and W is a set of weighted
edges between clusters. Formally, the weight assigned to the edge WW 6 W,
that connects clusters CX, Cy e V, is estimated by

_ |L,nL,|

v— 4
WM ILXULyI ()

where LZ C X denotes the set of samples belonging to cluster C 2 e V. Figure 3a
shows the network of clusters that is generated from the example given in
Figure 1. Note that circle nodes represent clusters and edges exist only when
the corresponding weights are non-zero.

Given this network formalism, the new WCT algorithm is introduced
to disclose the similarity between any pair of clusters. It extends the
Connected-Triple method (Reuther and Walter, 2006) that has been originally
developed to identify ambiguous author names within publication databases.
In particular, the similarity of any CX,Cy e V can be estimated by counting
the number of Connected-Triples (i.e. triples) they are part of. Formally, a
triple, Triple = (V-mple, WTriple), is a subgraph of G containing three vertices
V-mple = {CX, Cy, Ck} C V and two non-zero edges W-mple = {wxbwyk} C W,
with WW 2 0. An example of triple within the network of Figure 3a is shown
in Figure 3b.

This simple counting might be sufﬁcient for any indivisible object, e.g.
name or sample. However, to evaluate the similarity between clusters, it is
important to realize and take into account the composite characteristic of a
cluster (i.e. shared members). Inspired by this idea, the WCT measure of
clusters CX, Cy e V with respect to each triple Ck e V, is estimated as

WCT:y =min(ka,wyk) (5)

where wxlhwyk e W are weights of the edges connecting clusters C), and Ck,
and clusters Cy and Ck, respectively. The count of all triples (l . . .11) between
clusters C), and Cy can be calculated as follows:

WCT,y =chr’;y (6)

Then, the similarity between clusters C), and Cy can be estimated by
WCT”.

where WCTmax is the maximum WCTW value of any two clusters C,,, C,, e V
and DC 6 (0, l) is a constant decay factor (i.e. conﬁdence level of accepting
two non-identical clusters as being similar). Following the example shown in
Figs 1 and 3, the discovered link-based similarities/relations and the resulting
RM are presented in Figure 4.

2.2 Applying a consensus function to RM

Having obtained a reﬁned cluster-association matrix (RM) with the
aforementioned link-based similarity algorithm, a graph-based partitioning
method is exploited to obtain the ﬁnal clustering. This consensus function
requires the underlying matrix to be initially transformed into a weighted
bipartite graph. Formally, given an RM representing associations between
N samples and P clusters in an ensemble H, a weighted bipartite graph
G=(V,W) can be constructed, where V=VXUVC is a set of vertices
representing both samples VX and clusters VC, and W denotes a set of
weighted edges that can be deﬁned as follows:

0 wij :0 when vertices vi,v]- e VX, i.e. correspond to samples.

0 wij :0 when vertices vi,v]- 6 VC, i.e. correspond to clusters.

0 wij =RM(v,», vi) when vertices vi 6 VX and v]- 6 VC. The bipartite graph
G is bi-directional such that wil- is equivalent to wji.

Given such graph, the spectral graph partitioning (SPEC) method similar
to that of Ng et al. (2002) is applied to generate a ﬁnal data partition.
This is a powerful method for decomposing an undirected graph, with good
performance being exhibited in many application areas, including protein
modelling, information retrieval and identiﬁcation of densely connected
on-line hypertextual regions (Luxburg, 2007). Principally, given a graph
G=(V,W), SPEC ﬁrst ﬁnds the K largest eigenvectors u1,...,uK of W,
which are used to formed another matrix U (i.e. U: [u] ,...,uK]), whose
rows are then normalized to have unit length. By considering the row of U
as K—dimensional embedding of the graph vertices, SPEC applies k-means to
these embedded points in order to acquire the ﬁnal clustering result. Further
details of SPEC can be found in Supplementary Section 1.

2.3 Experiment design

The experiments set out to investigate the performance of LCE compared
to a number of different simple/standard clustering algorithms and state-of-
the-art cluster ensemble methods, over real gene expression and synthetic
datasets. The compared techniques include: (i) HBGF that is the baseline
model of LCE; (ii) four simple clustering techniques that are usually
used by clinical researchers to analyse microarray data [k-means (KM),
single-linkage (SL), complete-linkage (CL) and average-linkage (AL)];
(iii) three pairwise similarity-based cluster ensemble algorithms that have
been developed so far for gene expression data analysis [MULTI-K,
consensus clustering with hierarchical clustering (CCHC) and graph-based
consensus clustering (GCC)], and three graph-based cluster ensemble
techniques that have been considered as benchmarks in the literature [Cluster-
based Similarity Partitioning Algorithm (CSPA), Hyper-Graph Partitioning
Algorithm (HGPA) and Meta-Clustering Algorithm (MCLA)]. Details of
examined cluster ensemble techniques are given below.

similarity matrix (C0) is constructed as C0(xi,)rj) = ﬁ zit/11:1 S,,,(xi,xj),
where CO(xi,)r]-) E [0, 1] represents the similarity measure between
samples xi,x]-EX. In addition, S,,,(xi,)rj)=1 if C”'(xi)=C”'()r]-), and
S,,,(xi,xj)=0 otherwise. Note that C”'(x,») denotes the cluster label of
the m-th clustering to which a sample xi EX belongs.

Since co-association matrix (CO) is a similarity matrix, any similarity-
based clustering algorithm (referred to as ‘consensus function”) can
be applied to this matrix to yield the ﬁnal partition 71* (Fred and
Jain, 2005). Among several existing similarity-based techniques, the
most well-known is agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm.
Speciﬁcally to the problem of clustering cancer samples, MULTI-K
(Kim et al., 2009) and CCHC (Monti et al., 2003) methods make use
the SL and AL agglomerative hierarchical clusterings as consensus
functions, respectively. In addition, to obtain 71*, the GCC approach
(Yu et al., 2007) transforms the CO matrix into a graph of samples to
which the normalized cut algorithm (Shi and Malik. 2000) is applied.

0 Graph-basea1 cluster ensemble algorithms that are investigated herein
include the methods of Fern and Brodley (2004) (HBGF) and Strehl and
Ghosh (2002) (CSPA, HGPA and MCLA). Note that HBGF is included
as the baseline model of LCE. It makes use of the bipartite graph that
is generated from the BM. There is no edge connecting vertices of the
same object type, and the weight of an edge between any data point
and cluster is either 1 (when the sample belongs to the cluster) or 0
(otherwise). SPEC (Ng et al., 2002) is exploited to obtain the ﬁnal
clustering result from this graph. This effectively allows the quality of
the two cluster-association matrices (i.e. BM and RM) to be compared.
CSPA creates a similarity graph, where vertices represent samples and
edges” weight represent similarity scores obtained from the CO matrix.
Afterwards, a graph partitioning algorithm called METIS (Karypis
and Kumar, 1998) is used to partition the similarity graph into X
clusters. HGPA constructs a hyper-graph, where vertices represent
samples and the same-weighted hyper-edges represent clusters in the
ensemble. Then, HMETIS (Karypis et al., 1999) is applied to partition
the underlying hyper-graph into X parts. MCLA creates a graph where
each vertex corresponds to each cluster in the ensemble and each
edge’s weight between any two cluster vertices is computed using
the binary Jaccard measure. METIS is also employed to partition the
meta-level graph into X meta-clusters. The ﬁnal clustering is produced
by assigning each sample to the meta-cluster with which it is most
frequently associated.

Note that the performance of SL, CL, AL and KM are always assessed
over the original data, without using any information of cluster ensemble.

The effectiveness of LCE and other cluster ensemble methods with different
ensemble sizes and types are also empirically examined. Details of gene
expression datasets and experiment setting are presented below.

2.3.] Real gene expression datasets This evaluation is based on real
gene expression data, obtained from nine published microarray studies,
and summarized in Table 1. The experiments were conducted over ﬁltered
datasets as given in the empirical study of de Souto et al. (2008), where
uninformative genes are removed for a better quality of clustering result.
Details of the types of datasets, data preprocessing and the gene selection
method are given in Supplementary Sections 2172.2. To rigourously evaluate
the robustness of LCE and its compared techniques, they are also assessed
on both simulated gene expression data (with noise and imbalanced clusters)
and geometrically complicated datasets (see Supplementary Sections 341 for
data descriptions).

2.3.2 Experiment setting The proposed LCE method and its competitors
are evaluated, using the experiment setting illustrated below.

0 Each cluster ensemble method is evaluated over four different types of

ensemble: (i) Fixed-k with full-space data (with a1 genes), (ii) Fixed-k
with subspace data (with (1 genes), (iii) Random-k with full-space data
and (iv) Random-k with subspace data, respectively.

0 An ensemble size (M) of only 10 base clusterings was used.

0 To generate a reﬁned cluster-association matrix (RM), the constant
decay factor (DC) of 0.9 is exploited with the underlying link-based
similarity algorithm (i.e. WCT).

0 For a comparison purpose, as in Fern and Brodley (2004) and Kim
et al. (2009), each clustering method divides data points into apartition
of K (the number of true classes for each dataset, known as ‘gold
standard”) clusters, which is then evaluated against the corresponding
true partition using a set of well-known evaluation indices. Note that,
true classes are known for all datasets but are absolutely not used
in any way by the cluster ensemble process; they are only used to
evaluate the quality of the clustering results after clustering is complete.
This assessment framework has been successfully adopted in de Souto
et al. (2008) to compare the performance of different simple clustering
algorithms over a large number of gene expression datasets.

0 The current research follows several previous studies (Kim et al.,
2009; Monti et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2007) that focus on clustering
samples of a given microarray data into known groups, i.e. class
prediction. In particular to these methods, the quality of data partition
71* generated by a clustering technique is directly compared against the

known partition 11’ (i.e. class labels), using external validity indices
such as Adjusted Rand (AR; Hubert and Arabic, 1985), Normalized
Mutual Information (NMI; Strehl and Ghosh, 2002) and Classiﬁcation
Accuracy (CA; Nguyen and Caruana, 2007). These speciﬁc indices are
exploited for evaluating the performance of the proposed LCE method,
against several other clustering techniques.

The limitation of this evaluation is that the capability of examined
methods for ‘class discovery” has not been reviewed. Unlike the task
of class prediction, the quality of data partition is determined by a
structural properties of clusters, e.g. a compactness of samples in
a cluster and a distance between clusters. To this extent, an initial
study regarding of LCE for the task of class discovery is provided
in Supplementary Section 8.2. In addition, the analysis of gene domain
is another prominent research, in which LCE may prove to be useful.
In particular, a better quality assessment should make use of a validity
index that takes into account known gene functions, instead of simple
external or internal indices mentioned earlier. Here, the performance of
a given clustering algorithm is justiﬁed in terms of its ability to produce
biologically meaningful clusters using a reference set of functional
classes, which can be obtained from prior biological knowledge speciﬁc
to a microarray study or may be formed using the growing databases
of Gene Ontologies.

The quality of each cluster ensemble method with respect to a speciﬁc
ensemble setting is generalized as the average of 50 runs.

3 RESULTS

The results‘ with real gene expression data are summarized in
Figure 5, where each investigated clustering method is represented
with its average validity measure across all validity indices, datasets
and ensemble types. It is clear that LCE regularly performs
better than any of these clustering methods. It also enhances the
performance of KM, which is used as base clusterings. In particular,
HBGF is apparently less effective than LCE. This information
suggests that the quality of the reﬁned cluster-association matrix
(RM) is superior than the original BM counterpart. See the
ﬁill results with real gene expression datasets in Supplementary
Section 2.3.

Following the study of Kuncheva et al. (2006), to rigourously
evaluate the quality of investigated clustering techniques, the
number of times that one method is signiﬁcantly better and worse
(to 95% conﬁdence level) than the others are assessed across
all experiment settings. Let Xc(i,ﬂ) be the average value of
validity index C E {CA, NMI, AR} across n runs (n=50 in this
evaluation) for a cluster ensemble method iECM (CM is a set
of 12 experimented clustering methods), on a speciﬁc experiment

Using the aforementioned assessment formalism, Figure 6

(B — W)l- = ZVCQCA’NMLAR} BC (i) — Wc(i). The results shown in
this ﬁgure indicate that LCE is more effective than other clustering
techniques included in this experiment. Since SL and AL do not
perform well over the examined datasets, MULTI-K and CCHC
that use the former and latter as a consensus function, respectively,
are less accurate than other cluster ensemble methods and KM.
However, their performance may improve with an ensemble that
is much larger than the one investigated herein (i.e. M > > 10). In
addition to this evaluation scheme, a further performance analysis
with a paired t-test is discussed in Supplementary Section 2.4.

Another important investigation is on the subject of relations
between performance of experimented cluster ensemble methods
and different types of ensemble being explored in the present
evaluation. Figure 7 shows the average validity measures of different
cluster ensemble methods across all validity indices and real
gene expression datasets. For each method, its performance with

Fig. 8. The relations between DCE {0.1,0.2,...,0.9} and the performance
of the LCE method (the averages of CA, NMI and AR over 10 real gene
expression datasets and 4 ensemble types), whose values are presented in
X -axis and Y—axis, respectively. Note that the averaged performance of other
cluster ensemble methods are also included for a comparison purpose.

four ensemble types (Full-space +Fixed-k, Full-space + Random-k,
Subspace+Fixed-k, and Subspace+Random-k) are compared. It
is clear that LCE is more effective than other cluster ensemble
techniques over all ensemble types, with its best performance being
generated from a ‘Full-space+Fixed-k” ensemble. Most methods
work better with Full-space ensembles, as compared to Subspace
alternatives. Unlike LCE, GCC and other graph-based techniques
that usually produce a superior performance with a Fixed-k ensemble
type, MULTI-K and CCHC are best when coupled with Random-k
ensembles.

Although the results are impressive, on several datasets, it
is important to ensure they are obtainable in a wide range of
conditions. To this end the LCE algorithm”s response was examined
to perturbations in its parameters, and by investigating its time and
space complexity.

3.1 Parameter analysis

The parameter that has any effect on the results of LCE is DC [see
Equation (7)]. With the ensemble size of 10, we varied this value
from 0.1 through 0.9, in steps of 0.1, for three validity measures,
and obtained the results in Figure 8. This ﬁgure clearly shows that
the results are robust, and do not depend strongly on any particulary
value of DC. This makes it easy for users to obtain high-quality,
reliable results when using LCE, particularly since values of DC near
0.7 generally produce the best results. Although there is variation in
response across the DC values, the performance of LCE is always
better than any of the other cluster ensemble methods included in
this assessment.

Another important parameter that may determine the quality of a
cluster ensemble technique, is the ensemble size (M). Intuitively,
the larger an ensemble is, the better the performance becomes.

Fig. 9. Performance of different cluster ensemble methods in accordance
with ensemble size (ME {10,20,..., 100}), as the averages of validity
measures (CA, NMI and AR) across all real gene expression datasets and
ensemble types.

According to Figure 9 in which DC = 0.9, this heuristic is applicable
to LCE, where its validity measures (averages of CA, NMI and AR
across all experimental settings) gradually incline to the increasing
value of M E {10, 20, . . ., 100}. Furthermore, LCE performs better
than its competitors with all different ensemble sizes. Note that a
bigger ensemble leads to an improved accuracy, but with the tradeoff
of run time—but, again, even the worst results for LCE are better
than the best results of the other methods. These ﬁndings regarding
the relation between LCE and its parameters have also been observed
when both DC and M are simultaneously analysed (see details in
Supplementary Section 7).

3.2 Complexity analysis

The space and time complexity of creating a reﬁned cluster-
association matrix (RM) are 0(P2+NP) and 0(P2l+NP), where
N is the number of samples, P denotes the number of all clusters in
an ensemble 1'1 and l represents the average number of neighbours
connecting to one cluster in a link network of clusters. For each
entry (corresponding to clusters CX, Cy E H) in the P X P matrix of
cluster similarity, WCT searches through l neighbors of CX (or Cy)
to identify connected triples. Following this, the RM of size N XP
is created using the aforementioned similarity matrix. As a result,
LCE is computationally efﬁcient with the time complexity generally
converging to 0(N). Please consult Supplementary Section 6 for
details of the scalability test.

3.3 Additional utilization of RM with simple clusterings

Besides its current utilization through the formation of a weighted
bipartite graph, the RM can also be regarded as a ‘high-level”
data matrix to which any simple clustering algorithm can be
directly applied. Promising results have been obtained from the
exploitation of six simple clustering techniques with RM: RM + SL,
RM + CL, RM + AL, RM + KM, RM + Partitioning Around Medoids
and RM+spectral clustering, respectively (see detailed results in
Supplementary Section 5).

4 CONCLUSION

A new LCE method has been introduced for clustering gene
expression data samples that has greatly improved accuracy and
efﬁciency. The performance of LCE is usually superior than existing
graph-based ensemble techniques, and those that are particularly
developed for gene data analysis. LCE is highly effective over
real gene expression datasets and synthetic data collections (with

the presence of noise and non-equal-size clusters). Unlike existing
pairwise similarity based counterparts, LCE is efﬁcient for clustering
large-size datasets, including the clustering of genes. Speciﬁcally,
the reﬁned cluster-association matrix (RM) used by LCE is able
to recover and account for unknown entries in the original BM
counterpart, and hence, delivers a superior clustering performance.
With its consistent performance over settings of parameter, ensemble
type and size, LCE also proves to be a user-friendly data analysis
tool, especially for non-expert users.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have had a pro-
found impact on studies of membrane proteins during past two dec-
ades, but the accuracy of MD simulations of membranes is limited by
the quality of membrane models and the applied force fields.
Membrane models used in MD simulations mostly contain one kind
of lipid molecule. This is far from reality, for biological membranes
always contain more than one kind of lipid molecule. Moreover, the
lipid composition and their distribution are functionally important. As a
result, there is a necessity to prepare more realistic lipid membranes
containing different types of lipids at physiological concentrations.
Results: To automate and simplify the building process of heteroge-
neous lipid bilayers as well as providing molecular topologies for
included lipids based on both united and all-atom force fields, we
provided MemBuilder as a web-based graphical user interface.
Availability and implementation: MemBuilder is a free web server
available from www.membuilder.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

The plasma membrane forms a boundary between the cytoplasm
and the extracellular environment and as such plays fundamental
roles in the chemistry of living organisms. Membranes also par-
tition eukaryotic cytoplasms into intracellular compartments.
They are home to membrane proteins, accounting for ~2}
30% of the genome, that carry out a variety of functions ranging
from membrane trafﬁcking and signal transduction to transpor-
tation of organic and inorganic compounds (Bond and Sansom,
2006). Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand mem-
brane-associated proteins better and to know how they interact
with membrane components. The spatial inhomogeneity of lipid

molecules, in particular, that of sphingomyelin and cholesterol,
across the secretory membrane system affects localization of
membrane proteins (Sprong et al., 2001) and permeability
(Wennberg et al., 2012). A ﬂuid membrane structure is needed
to model how membranes affect protein structure (White et al.,
2001). It has proved difficult to determine high-resolution 3D
structure of membrane proteins to map proteinimembrane inter-
actions in atomic detail (White, 2004). Structural and energetic
information on these interactions would provide important clues
about membrane protein function and assembly.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have provided signiﬁ-
cant new insight into fundamental interactions within membrane
systems (Kandt et al., 2007). One major concern in setting up a
membrane protein simulation is the construction of realistic lipid
bilayers (Kandt et al., 2007; Tieleman et al., 1997). It is well
known that lipid molecules are distributed asymmetrically be-
tween the leaﬂets of biomembranes, which have functional im-
portance (Rahmanpour et al., 2012; Rothman and Lenard, 1977;
Spector and Yorek, 1985). Accordingly, MD simulation of mem-
brane models should aim to model membranes with physiologic-
ally relevant lipid compositions. Heterogeneous membrane
models with speciﬁed lipid composition should be used for ob-
taining additional details on the properties of membrane pro-
teins, even though it is realized that the equilibration of
complex membranes will take a long time. To this end, Jo
et a]. (2009) published the CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder
for mixed bilayers. Following this approach, here we provide
MemBuilder, a web server with a simple interface, to automate
the building of heterogeneous membranes for the biomolecular
simulation program GROMACS (Fig. 1). Because there is a
large user base for the GROMACS package (Pronk et al.,
2013), there will be a significant demand for this kind of service.
Using MemBuilder, one can select a set of lipid molecules with
speciﬁed quantities to build heterogeneous lipid bilayers based
on both all atom and united atom force ﬁelds with explicit sup-
port for bilayers with asymmetric lipid composition.
MemBuilder provides GROMACS topology input ﬁles and
energy-minimized coordinates.

2 METHODS

MemBuilder supports 18 different lipid molecules (Table 1). Users can
specify type and quantity of lipid molecules for each membrane layer on
their request. Lipid molecules’ structure and force ﬁeld parameters are
obtained from the Lipidbook database (Domanski et al., 2010), Tieleman
laboratory (http://www.ucalgary.ca/tieleman/) and SoftSimu group
(http://www.softsimu.net/). MemBuilder supports four different force
ﬁelds optimized for molecular simulation of lipids including
GROMOS96 43a1 (van Gunsteren et al., 1996), GROMOS96 43a1-83
(Chiu et al., 2009; Pandit et al., 2008), GROMOS96 53a6 (Oostenbrink
et al., 2004) and Slipid/amber (Jambeck and Lyubartsev, 2012a, b, c).
MemBuilder contains GROMACS parameter ﬁles (.itp) for the entire
included lipid molecules. Parameter ﬁles of the both GROMOS96
43a1-S3 and Slipid/amber force ﬁelds are linked to the original.
MemBuilder builds a grid rectangular box for each membrane layer.
The number of cells is equal to the number (644100) of lipid molecules
selected for each layer. The lipid molecules are distributed randomly over
the grid cells but with ﬁxed conformation. The process uses a different

random seed number each time and thus will generate different lipid
bilayer conformations for each trial. Simple Point Charge (SPC) water
molecules solvate the bilayer on both sides. To neutralize the charge of
the system and to generate the appropriate ionic strength, monovalent ions
(NaT, KT, ClT) and divalent ions (Ca+2, Mg+2) can be added to the solv-
ent. Water molecules will be randomly replaced by ions. Finally,
MemBuilder performs an energy minimization to relax local stress in the
lipid bilayer.

3 DISCUSSION

MemBuilder assists GROMACS users in building membrane
bilayers. It provides topology files of 18 lipid molecules in
GROMACS format. Currently the GROMOS96 (43al, 43al-
S3 and 53a6) and AMBER (Slipid/Amber) force ﬁelds are
supported. To demonstrate the correctness of the output, six
simulations with generated bilayers are reported in the support-
ing information. All simulations are stable and equilibrate within
10 ns. Further lipids, force ﬁelds and geometries such as micelles,
nanodisks and liposomes will be supported in future versions to
help users to investigate membranes through molecular dynamics
simulations.

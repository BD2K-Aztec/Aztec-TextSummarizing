ABSTRACT

Motivation: It has been recognized that the topology of molecular
networks provides information about the certainty and nature of
individual interactions. Thus, network motifs have been used for
predicting missing links in biological networks and for removing false
positives. However, various different measures can be inferred from
the structure of a given network and their predictive power varies
depending on the task at hand.

Results: Herein, we present a systematic assessment of seven
different network features extracted from the topology of functional
genetic networks and we quantify their ability to classify interactions
into different types of physical protein associations. Using machine
learning, we combine features based on network topology with non-
network features and compare their importance of the classification
of interactions. We demonstrate the utility of network features based
on human and budding yeast networks; we show that network
features can distinguish different sub-types of physical protein
associations and we apply the framework to fission yeast, which
has a much sparser known physical interactome than the other
two species. Our analysis shows that network features are at least
as predictive for the tasks we tested as non-network features.
However, feature importance varies between species owing to
different topological characteristics of the networks. The application
to fission yeast shows that small maps of physical interactomes can
be extended based on functional networks, which are often more
readily available.

1 INTRODUCTION

Information about physical protein—protein interactions (PPIs) is
essential for a system-level understanding of complex biological
mechanisms. Two of the major areas of research in that respect
are the discovery and interpretation of PPIs. A set of PPIs can
be represented as a network (or graph) where nodes represent
proteins and edges represent physical binding proteins. The topology

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

of molecular networks contains an extra layer of information
beyond the mere representation of binary interactions, thus,
topological properties and graph theoretical algorithms can be used
for understanding and interpreting these networks (Przulj, 2011).
Topological information is mainly used for the interpretation of
PPIs, i.e. for extracting biological information. Based on network
topology, proteins have been assessed for their association with
a given disease (Aragues et al., 2008; Vanunu et al., 2010) or
functionally related modules have been extracted (Hua Li and Liang
2009; Jingchun Chen and Yuan, 2006; Milenkovic and Przulj 2008;
Przulj et al., 2004).

In addition to interpretation, PPI network topology is also used
for discovering new interactions. Features derived from network
topology have been used for improving the quality of PPIs
obtained by high-throughput screens such as yeast two-hybrid
(Y2H) or co-puriﬁcation methods followed by afﬁnity-puriﬁcation
mass spectrometry (AP-MS). PPI networks are improved either by
eliminating false-positive edges or by complementing the network
by adding undetected interactions. For example, Friedel and Zimmer
(2009) used minimum spanning trees (MSTs) to infer the topology
of direct binding in protein complexes obtained from afﬁnity-
puriﬁcation assays. Kuchaiev et al. (2009) took advantage of the
fact that high-quality PPIs are well modeled by geometric graphs for
the de-noising of PPIs. They embedded the given PPI network into
a Euclidian space and predicted interactions between proteins that
are mapped closer than a threshold distance in the Euclidian space.
Edges in the PPI that link proteins that are distant in the embedded
space were classiﬁed as false positives. Others have identiﬁed
protein complexes in networks by searching for densely connected
regions (Bu, 2003; Qi et al., 2008; Spirin and Mimy, 2003; Vazquez
et al., 2003). All of these studies require physical PPI networks to be
available as input, which is often not the case for many less-studied
organisms. Direct measurement of physical protein binding is a
resource-intensive task even though high-throughput technologies
such as AP-MS and Y2H exist. However, there is a large amount
of data derived from other techniques (such as co-expression or
genetic interactions) that hint at functional associations between
genes or proteins rather than physical protein—protein binding. As a
result, predicted functional interaction networks (where ‘functional
interaction’ is deﬁned as pathway co-membership) are readily
available for many organisms (Szklarczyk et al., 2011). In this
study, we investigate the possibility of using functional interaction
networks to predict physical binding.

Given a ﬁinctional network, it is likely that only a subset of the
edges will also correspond to physical association of the proteins.

Fig. 1. Sample subgraphs from a functional network. Solid edges
represent physical interactions and dashed edges represent functional-only
interactions. (3) Proteins X. Y and Z are all participating in the same pathway
(i.e. are functionally linked). but only XY and Y2 are directly interacting.
We observed in such situations that if we convert strength of the functional
interactions to edge weights such that stronger interactions have smaller
weights. the weight. |XZ| between X and Z in the functional network is often
higher than |XY| and |YZ|. This motivates the shortest path ratio. which is
(|XY| + |YZ|)/|XZ| . This ratio is less than 1 if the edges XY and Y2 are strong
(small weight) compared to XZ. (b) Both proteins participating in a common
signaling pathway (left) as well as a protein complex represented by the
spoke model (right) may lead to densely connected subgraph in the functional
network. (See Supplementary analysis for a detailed explanation of matrix
and spoke models for representing results of co-puriﬁcation experiments)

Non-physical functional interactions in turn are often indirectly
mediated through a sequence of molecular interactions, e.g. because
the two proteins participate in the same pathway. Our conjecture
is that the ﬁinctional network is by and large shaped by the
physical interactions (Fig. 1). For example, it is likely to detect
a ﬁinctional link between two genes that are physically interacting
with a common third gene. We noticed that these indirect interactions
often have lower conﬁdence scores (in a ﬁinctional network) than
the direct physical interactions. This notion can be exploited for
predicting the subset of ﬁinctional interactions that are also physical,
e. g. based on the ratio of the shortest distance between two proteins
and the edge weight directly connecting the two (Fig. 1a). Likewise,
densely connected sub-networks may be indicative of protein
complexes, i.e. physical association. Accordingly, the density of a
given sub-network has been used for predicting missing links in
a physical protein interaction network (Albert and Albert, 2004;
Kuchaiev et al., 2009; Qi et al., 2008). This situation is, however,
more complicated in functional networks: closely related genes
operating in a common pathway may also be densely connected
in a functional network (Fig. 1b). Hence, topological features
quantifying the density of edges (such as ‘clustering coefﬁcient’)
may have poor predictive power when used in isolation in ﬁinctional
networks. Herein, we show that combining topological features with
other lines of evidence improves the speciﬁcity when predicting
physical protein binding from functional networks.

We set out to test the effectiveness of combining various network
topological features for predicting the interaction type represented
by a given edge in a ﬁinctional network. Speciﬁcally, the goal is
to infer the subset of interactions from a functional network that
also corresponds to physical associations of the respective proteins.
To achieve that we combined network topology-based features with
features that are used to predict the functional association in the
ﬁrst place. We extracted seven topological features for each edge in
an existing ﬁinctional interaction network. These features describe
the topological characteristics of an edge such as its centrality, node
neighborhoods and connection strength relative to alternative paths.
We complemented these network features with the features that were

used to predict that ﬁinctional edge and trained a machine learning
classiﬁer to distinguish physical from purely ﬁinctional interactions.
Using such a machine learning approach, we can assess the
importance of network features compared to other types of features,
and we can quantify the relative importance of individual network
features for predicting speciﬁc types of physical binding events.

We deﬁned three classes of interactions in a ﬁinctional network,
namely, ‘binary’, ‘co-complex’ and ‘functional-only’. Given a
scaffold network of ﬁinctional interactions, the task is to assign
each edge to one of these three classes. The ﬁrst two classes
represent physical association of interacting proteins, while the last
one denotes functionally related proteins (or genes) that do not
bind. The distinction between binary and co-complex interactions
is operational and based on the available experimental data (see
Section 2 for more details). The binary class is mainly composed
of directly binding protein pairs, while the co-complex class
contains sets of proteins that are puriﬁed together and likely are
part of a common complex. However, we emphasize that these
are not strict classiﬁcations, because the experimental data do
not allow to rigorously and unambiguously separate these two
classes. For each edge in the functional network, we calculated
a set of network features extracted from the topology of the
network. Then we used a supervised machine learning approach to
predict and distinguish the three types of interactions. We showed
the effectiveness of our approach on human and budding yeast
networks. The analysis of these networks showed the value of
individual network features, revealing that the predictive power
of the features is dependent on the species and the available data.
Finally, we applied our method to predict 2853 novel physical PPIs in
ﬁssion yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), which is an important
model organism with so far few endogenously measured protein
interactions.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

For each of the three organisms. the functional interaction network is acquired
from the STRING database (version 8.3) (Jensen et al.. 2009). STRING
combines seven different feature types for predicting functional interactions
between genes. The features used by STRING are ‘genomic neighborhood.
gene fusion. phylogenetic proﬁle (co-occurence). co-expression. text mining.
experimental evidence and database” evidence. Using these features.
STRING calculates a combined score that represents the conﬁdence that
a functional association exists. We re-calculated the STRING combined
score without using the experimental and database features in order to avoid
circular reasoning (since these lines of evidence might be based on the same
data as our training set). A similar concern may be raised with respect to text
mining since it may rest on the same publications used for generating the
training sets. Therefore. we re-computed the performance scoring without
text mining and showed that text mining does not inﬂate the performance
scores due to circular reasoning (see Supplementary Fig. S 1). Re-calculation
of the combined STRING score was done according to the original scheme
used for STRING:
S=1—1‘[(1—S.).

where S i is the individual evidence expressed as probability of being true and
S is the integrated score. STRING only reports interactions with conﬁdence
scores S above 0.15. We followed the same scheme and converted scores
for the remaining interactions into edge weights E =—log(S). Thus. when
computing network distances. nodes connected by a high-conﬁdence edge
(large S) will have a small weight (small E).

Topology of functional networks

 

We deﬁned three different classes of interactions: binary. co-complex
and functional-only. In the binary class. we tried to capture more transient
interactions such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination. The co-complex
class contains protein pairs from stable complexes. Finally. the functional-
only class represents functionally related proteins that are not physically
interacting. Binary and co-complex classes together constitute the physical
interactions. The numbers of interactions in each class and in the modiﬁed
STRING network are listed in Table 1.

For budding yeast. we used physical interaction data from BioGRID
(Stark et al.. 2011). Interactions annotated as ‘Biochemical Activity” or
‘Two-hybrid’ are used as binary interactions. where interactions captured by
‘Co-puriﬁcation’. ‘Afﬁnity Capture-Luminescence”. ‘Afﬁnity Capture-MS”
and ‘Afﬁnity Capture-Western” were classiﬁed as co-complex interactions.
If an interaction was detected by both types of methods (e.g. ‘Two-hybrid’
and ‘Co-puriﬁcation’). we treated it as a co-complex interaction. We also
included binary interactions deﬁned in KEGG pathways (Kanehisa et al..
2010). We collected physical interactions from IntAct (Aranda et al.. 2010)
as an external validation set. We removed all interactions overlapping with
the training data from this validation set. For human. binary and co-complex
interactions were generated similarly with the exception that complexes
reported in CORUM (Ruepp et al.. 2010) are also incorporated into the
co-complex class using the matrix model (i.e. all pairwise interactions). We
used high-conﬁdence interactions reported in a previous analysis (Bossi and
Lehner. 2009) (termed CRGhigh) as an independent validation set for human
after removing all interactions overlapping with our training data.

In ﬁssion yeast. intersection of the BioGRID with STRING resulted in
only 659 interactions that could be used as training data. In order to increase
this number. we incorporated interactions from other databases. namely. DIP.
MINT. IntAct and KEGG (Ceol et al.. 2010; Xenarios et al.. 2000). This
approach resulted in 1161 distinct interactions in total that could be used
for training. Information about the experimental system or the nature of
the interactions is not available for many of these interactions. Thus. we
only performed a two-class (physical versus non-physical) classiﬁcation for
ﬁssion yeast. Additionally. we mapped a set of interactions from budding
yeast using orthology. i.e. ‘interologs’ (Matthews et al.. 2001). We only
mapped interologs for budding yeast proteins with unique orthologs in ﬁssion
yeast. We used these interactions as an external validation set for ﬁssion yeast.

For all three organisms. interactions in the functional-only class were
generated using KEGG pathways. This functional-only set is composed of
gene pairs that are in the same KEGG pathway but whose protein products
are not known to be physically interacting. This set forms the negative
training and test set for the prediction of physical interactions in the STRING
functional network. A general approach for generating a negative set is
to generate random pairs of genes and sampling from these pairs. As the
number of physical interactions is small compared to all possible pairings
in a genome. this sampled negative set is expected to be highly enriched for
non-interacting pairs thus containing a small number of false negatives. This
approach. however. fails in our case. because we need a negative reference
set of links in the functional network. All proteins connected in a functional
network are per se more likely to also physically interact. We therefore chose
to deﬁne the negative (functional-only) set using well-studied pathways.
Since these proteins are better studied. it is less likely that there are unknown
physical interactions (false negatives) among those protein pairs.

2.2 Network features

For each edge of a given graph. we deﬁned seven features using topological
properties of the functional interaction graph.

2.2.1 Minimum spanning tree A spanning tree of a graph is deﬁned as
a subgraph. which is a tree that connects all vertices of the graph. A MST
is the spanning tree where the sum of its edge weights is smaller than or
equal to the sum of the weights of all other spanning trees. After calculating
a MST. we deﬁned this binary feature to be 1 if the corresponding edge is
on the MST and 0 if not (Friedel and Zimmer. 2009). It is possible to have

more than one MST in a given network but we only consider the ﬁrst one
for simplicity. We compared the union of all possible MSTs with the ﬁrst
MST. In case of the human network. we found that the union contained only
486 edges more than the ﬁrst MST (the human network has 14063 nodes
(genes) and 924 616 edges). Hence. the MSTs are very similar. Anyway. the
extended MST (see Section 2.2.2) is a superset of all possible MSTs.

2.2.2 Extended minimum spanning tree For a graph with n vertices. a
MST may have at most n—l edges. This is sparser than expected in protein
interaction networks (Friedel and Zimmer. 2009). To extend the number of
edges in the MST. we considered each edge of the graph that was not already
in the MST. We took the nodes connected by the edge in consideration and
calculated the shortest path (a path between two vertices where the sum of
the weights of the edges on the path is minimum) between them in the MST.
If the sum of the weights on this shortest path (the distance of the nodes) in
the MST is larger than the weight of the direct edge itself. then the edge is
added to the extended MST. After calculating the extended MST. we again
generated a binary feature as we did for the MST. Note that this extending
strategy guarantees that any edge on any possible MST will be added to the
extended MST.

Since we used the STRING combined score to obtain the edge weights
of the graph. edges in the MST and extended MST represent a backbone
of the functional network that is connected with high scoring functional
interactions. MST-based features have previously been used to identify direct
physical binding in protein complexes identiﬁed by afﬁnity puriﬁcation
methods (Friedel and Zimmer. 2009).

2.2.3 Clustering coeﬁ‘icient In graph theory. a clustering coefﬁcient is a
measure of the edge density within a subgraph. First. we calculated the local
clustering coefﬁcient for each vertex. which is deﬁned as the ratio of the
number of observed edges between the neighbors of a vertex to the number
of all possible edges between the neighbors. If the neighbors of a vertex form
a clique (a subset of fully interconnected nodes). then this ratio becomes 1.
We deﬁned the clustering coefﬁcient feature of an edge as the average of the
local clustering coefﬁcients of the vertices connected by that edge. Qi et al.
(2008) used clustering coefﬁcients of vertices to identify protein complexes
in an interaction network.

2.2.4 Neighborhood ratio The neighborhood ratio (also known as the
Jaccard index) of an edge that connects vertices vi and v]- is the ratio of
the number of common neighbors of vi and Vj to the total number of all
neighbors of v, and v]: A similar scoring has been used to improve functional
networks in budding yeast (Lee et al.. 2004).

2.2.5 Global betweenness Global betweenness of an edge is deﬁned as
the number of shortest paths passing through the edge normalized by the
number of all possible shortest paths. This is a measure of centrality of the
edge in the graph. Global betweenness of edges has been used to detect
community structures in networks (Newman. 2004).

2.2.6 Local betweenness Local betweenness is same as global
betweenness. but deﬁned for the local neighborhood of the edge. We took
the subgraph that consists of only the immediate neighbors of the vertices
connected by the query edge.

A high global betweenness score indicates more centrality in the overall
network. while local betweenness is less dependent on the position of the
edge in the global network. When calculating both types of betweenness
scores. the graph was assumed to be un-weighted. When we calculated the
betweenness based on weighted edges. betweenness scores became very
sparse. For human. only 26% of the edges had non-zero local betweenness
and the situation was even worse for the global betweenness with only
7% non-zero scores. This is due to a small set of very strong functional
edges traversing most shortest paths even though they often introduced
a considerable number of ‘hops’. A correlation analysis showed that the

weighted betweenness scores were highly correlated with the ‘extended
MST’. ‘shortest path ratio’ and the ‘combined STRING score’. all of
which are reﬂecting connection strength of the functional associations
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus. there was also considerable redundancy
between the weighted betweenness and other features. leading us to only
consider un-weighted betweenness scores.

2.2.7 Shortest path to edge weight ratio For a given edge. this is the
ratio of the shortest path between the vertices connected by the edge to
the weight of the edge itself. Note that this feature assumes the maximum
value of 1 if the shortest path is the edge itself. This feature penalizes very
weak links connecting two vertices that are also indirectly connected through
other. much stronger edges. In such case. the ratio will be signiﬁcantly
below 1.

2.3 STRING features

Five features were taken from the STRING database (version 8.3):
genomic neighborhood. gene fusion. phylogenetic proﬁle. co-expression
and text mining in addition to the re-calculated combined score. ‘Genomic
neighborhood’ indicates whether the two genes are closely located in
genomes. ‘Gene fusion’ evidence shows fusion events in orthologous
genes. ‘Phylogenetic proﬁle’ shows evidence of co-occurrence of the gene
pair in different organisms. ‘Co-expression’ indicates predicted association
between genes based on observed patterns of simultaneous expression of
genes. Finally. STRING parses a large body of publications for statistically
signiﬁcant co-occurrence of gene names and incorporates it as text mining
evidence.

2.4 Training and testing

We trained Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) for three-class classiﬁcation
(binary. co-complex and functional-only) using the ‘randomForest’ package
from R (Liaw and Wiener. 2002). To avoid a bias toward larger classes.
we randomly sampled from the larger sets to obtain training sets of
approximately even size. For a given edge to be predicted. Random Forest
returns probabilities for each class that add up to 1. Probability of being
physical is calculated as the sum of predicted probabilities of binary
and co-complex classes. Binary versus co-complex classiﬁcation is only
performed for the interactions where the probability of being physical is
above 0.5.

For all three organisms studied. we performed two types of validations.
First. we performed 5-fold cross-validation. At each step. l-fold of the data is
left aside for testing and the remaining folds are used for training. A Random
Forest with 1000 trees was trained for each fold. Second. we assessed the
performance of the model with an external validation set. In this case. external

data were used as positive (physical) test and an equal sized random sample
from the functional-only set that has not been used in training was used as
the negative test set. We ﬁltered the external validation test set so that it does
not contain any sample from the training set.

We used receiver operator characteristics (ROCs) and precisionirecall
(PR) curves to assess the classiﬁcation performance. The area under
ROC curve (AUC) is a popular threshold-independent measure for model
comparison. It directly reﬂects the difference in comparison to a random
ranking (Davis and Goadrich. 2006). However. in real-life applications. the
precision of the highest ranking predictions is of greater relevance. which is
better Visualized by PR curves. We therefore decided to use both means for
assessing the performance of the models.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Network features signiﬁcantly improve prediction
of physical interactions

We used the human, budding yeast and ﬁssion yeast networks from
STRING version 8.3 (Jensen et al., 2009) as the initial functional
networks for predicting physical interactions. After discarding
‘experimental and database’ evidences from STRING (to avoid re-
using evidence on which our reference set is based), we constructed
a ﬁinctional interaction graph for each species. We assigned weights
to edges in the graph such that stronger functional interactions get
lower weights. We derived seven network topological features from
this graph (Section 2) and assessed their utility for distinguishing
physical from non-physical interactions.

Initially, we restricted the analysis to human and budding yeast,
for which more interactions have been measured than for ﬁssion
yeast. For these two species, we obtained experimentally validated
interactions for all three classes from BioGRID, KEGG and
CORUM (Kanehisa et al., 2010; Ruepp et al., 2010; Stark et al.,
2011), which we used subsequently for supervised learning and
tesﬁng.

We trained multi-class Random Forest classiﬁers (Breiman, 2001)
using network features only, original STRING evidences only
and the combination of both. We decided to use Random Forest
because it is virtually assumption free, very adaptable and has
been shown to outperform other machine learning methods for
similar tasks (Elefsinioti et al., 201 1; Qi et al., 2006, 2009). Herein,
we compare Random Forest to Support Vector Machines (Burges,

1998) using default parameters and the radial basis function as
kernel. The comparison of the different machine learning methods
on the human network conﬁrmed the high performance of Random
Forest (Supplementary Fig. S3). Subsequently, we distinguished
network features (i.e. features derived from the topology of the
ﬁinctional network) and ‘STRING features’. This latter class of
features encompasses those that have been used for constructing
the ﬁinctional network including the integrated evidence score
(Combined Score). Figure 2 shows ROC curves and PR curves
for physical versus ﬁinctional-only classiﬁcation after 5-fold cross-
validation. Using the network features alone, we could better
distinguish physical from functional-only interactions compared
to using the STRING features alone. This analysis shows that
network features are useﬁil for predicting physical binding and
that the topological structure of the ﬁinctional network also
contains important information about the physical interactome.
In both organisms, combining network features with STRING
features increased the performance, indicating that network topology
provides complementary information that is not directly available
in the features used for creating the ﬁinctional network. The
improvement is more pronounced for high conﬁdence interactions,
which are actually more important for predicting new physical
interactions.

If a data source contains groups of similar samples, it is possible
that these similar samples scatter into train and test folds, which
may cause an overestimation of the performance based on cross-
validation. In order to overcome this problem, we also validated
our models by using test data obtained from two other sources
that were not used for training (Aranda et al., 2010; Bossi and
Lehner, 2009). Interactions that are already in our training data
were excluded from this analysis. This type of validation is only
performed for physical versus non-physical classiﬁcations, because

we did not have sufﬁcient information about the types of experiments
to sub-classify the measurements into binary and co-complex. A
random set of samples from the ﬁinctional-only set was used as
a negative test set. In human, CRGhigh was used as the external
validation set (see Section 2.1). Physical interactions extracted from
the IntAct database were used as external validation data for budding
yeast. This test gave similar results as the cross-validation for both
human and budding yeast (Fig. 3). Network features generalize
better than STRING features, and the difference is much more
striking in budding yeast. In both species, combining network and
STRING features improves the performance. These results indicate
that using network features in combination with machine learning is
not simply over-ﬁtting to the topological structure of the training set,
but it captures general information about the physical associations
underlying the functional network.

We also checked if the interactions predicted with the help of
network features are biased for proteins with speciﬁc functions.
We performed Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashbumer et al., 2000)
enrichment analysis in human for proteins involved in interactions
that are only predicted when using network features. We selected all
interactions that can be predicted with high conﬁdence (probability
of being physical >08) and used the proteins that are involved
in these interactions as background. Then we selected the subset
of these interactions that could not be predicted with STRING
features alone (Random Forest score <0.3). Prediction of these
interactions crucially relies on the inclusion of network features
in the model. We used ‘GO Term Finder’ (Boyle et al., 2004)
for the enrichment analysis and observed an enrichment for 195
GO molecular ﬁinction terms representing very diverse ﬁinctions
in the ontology (Supplementary Table 51). Thus, we do not have
evidence that network features introduce a bias for speciﬁc types
of proteins. Node degree and pleiotropy (multi-ﬁinctionality) of

genes are highly correlated, which can create substantial biases when
predicting the ﬁinction of genes using network information (Gillis
and Pavlidis, 2011). Thus, any highly connected set of proteins
is biased toward being enriched for many GO terms. Network
features are most useful for classifying interactions in densely
connected regions of the ﬁinctional network, which explains the
large number of very heterogeneous GO terms being enriched among
those genes.

3.2 Feature importance is network dependent

We also investigated the importance of features for distinguishing
each class. Random Forest provides a way of measuring the
importance of individual features for the model by permuting the
values of the corresponding feature among samples and measuring
the mean decrease in classiﬁcation accuracy. If a single feature
is highly important for the model, permutation of that feature
results in a large decrease in accuracy. Figure 4 shows the
feature importance values calculated by Random Forest for human
and budding yeast, separately for each class, in addition to the
overall importance. Both, STRING features and network features
are important for the successful classiﬁcation of interactions. An
important result of our analysis is the variable importance of
features when comparing different species. For example, both
the ‘global’ and ‘local betweenness’ scores are important for
ﬁinctional-only interactions for budding yeast. In contrast, the
global betweenness in human is the most important feature for
the binary class. Similarly, ‘co-expression’ is most important for
co-complex interactions in human, yet it is the least important
for co-complex interactions in human. We suspect that these
differences reﬂect differences in data availability and experimental
biases rather than ﬁindamental biological differences. Budding yeast
has been subjected to extensive testing of protein binding using
AP-MS technologies (Gavin et al., 2002, 2006; Krogan et al.,
2006). Such experiments have not been conducted at a comparable
scale (let alone comparable coverage) in human cells. Thus, the
budding yeast network is strongly enriched for densely connected
subnetworks compared to the human network. Such differences
will evidently affect the prediction strategy chosen by the machine
learning algorithm. There are also similarities. In both organisms,
text mining, combined score and ‘shortest path ratio’ are more
important for the functional-only class than for the binary and
co-complex classes (Fig. 4), suggesting that these features are
critical for distinguishing ﬁinctional-only interactions from physical
association.

One drawback of the permutation importance in Random Forest
is that in the case of correlated predictors, importance of one
of these individual predictors may be underestimated due to the
compensation from the other (Nicodemus et al., 2010). We also
calculated the Gini importance, which measures how well a given
feature splits the data into homogenous partitions. Gini importance
integrates the decrease in Gini impurity over all trees of the forest
whenever the corresponding feature is used for splitting (Breiman,
2001). Although it does not directly indicate importance of the
feature in the ﬁnal model, it is less affected by correlation with other
features and gives a more direct evaluation of the distinguishing
power of the feature. With respect to Gini importance, network
features are in general more important than STRING features
(Supplementary Fig. S4).

Mean Decrease in Accuracy

Fig. 4. Random Forest feature importance (Mean Decrease in Accuracy) for
(a) human and (b) budding yeast. Feature importance is shown for the entire
classiﬁcation task (Overall) and for predicting speciﬁc types of interactions
(‘Binary’. ‘Complex’ and ‘Functional-only’. respectively). STRING features
were taken from the STRING database as is. The combined score was
recalculated excluding experimental evidences (see main text for details)

Random Forest feature importance values do not show direct
correlation between the features and the classes. They only indicate
the importance of a feature for the non-linear model (i.e. conditional
on all other features used). In order to quantify the relationship
between individual features and the response variables (class
assignment), we performed t-tests for individual features indicating
how much a given feature separates the different interaction
classes (Fig. 5). According to the t-test, most features show
similar discriminative power in human and yeast with respect to
distinguishing ﬁinctional from physical interactions. Two notable
exceptions are clustering coefﬁcient and co-expression, which
perform very differently in the two species. Co-expression separates
physical from functional interactions only in human (Fig. 5a) but
not in budding yeast (Fig. 5b). This difference might be due to the
simpler transcriptional regulatory program in yeast. Hence, budding
yeast genes participating in the same pathway might be co-expressed
even if they do not bind directly, whereas this is less likely to happen
in mammals (Zhang et al., 2004). Interestingly, co-expression
is important for correctly classifying ﬁinctional interactions in
the yeast Random Forest model when combined with the other
features (Fig. 4b). This observation underlines the complexity of
relationships between features being exploited by Random Forest.
MST and extended MST are associated with physical interactions
(Fig. 5), yet they are not very important for the Random Forest model
(Fig. 4). This is mainly because these features are sparse, i.e. they
provide information only for a relatively small number of edges.
Shortest path ratio is strongly correlated with MST and extended

MST. The MST-based features may seem less relevant because of
this redundancy. However, removing shortest path ratio from the
model had no signiﬁcant effect on the importance scores of MST
and extended MST (Supplementary Fig. S5).

3.3 Distinguishing different types of physical
interactions

Next, we investigated in more detail how well we can separate
the two types of physical interactions (co-complex versus binary
interactions). Figure 6 shows the ROC curves and PR curves for
co-complex versus binary predictions. The AUC is higher in both
species when using network features alone than using STRING
features alone. Thus, network topology can be used effectively
for distinguishing different types of interactions. As shown before,
the importance of features is mostly network dependent (Fig. 4).
Relative importances of features with respect to binary and co-
complex classes vary between human and budding yeast. For
example, in human the two betweenness features are important
for predicting both co-complex and binary interactions, whereas in
budding yeast it is irrelevant for predicting co-complex interactions,
but important for the classiﬁcation of binary interactions.

A complication for the prediction of co-complex interactions
is the fact that AP-MS measurements usually do not infer the
topology of protein complexes, i.e. the structure of direct binding
events remains elusive. Protein complexes are often identiﬁed by
these experiments such that a single protein (bait) is ‘pulled down’
(puriﬁed) using an antibody together with all the proteins (preys)
belonging to the same multi-protein complex. The actual topology
of the binding of proteins in the complex is not revealed by such
an experiment. Thus, sets of commonly associated proteins have
been turned into ‘networks’ using either the spoke or matrix model
(Bader and Hogue, 2002). In the matrix model, all possible pairwise
interactions among the members of the complex (bait and preys)
are assumed. In the spoke model, interactions are only assigned
between the bait and each prey. Both models have shortcomings.
However, we can safely assume that protein complexes can be
represented as densely connected sub-networks. Random Forest
was capable of detecting these sub-networks while exploiting their
distinct characteristics with respect to the network features that we
inferred. We investigated to which extent our predictions are affected
by representing protein complexes using the spoke versus matrix
models. BioGRID does not provide details about the representation
of protein complexes. Thus, we limited this analysis to human
complexes from CORUM, where protein complex co-membership
is deﬁned. From each CORUM complex, we randomly chose a
protein as a ‘bait protein’ and then simulated both the spoke and
matrix models. It turns out that the importance of network features
is not much affected by the choice of the model (see Supplementary
Analysis).

3.4 Prediction of novel physical interactions in
ﬁssion yeast

The original motivation for this project was to reliably predict
physical interactomes in species where only a functional network
is available. The ﬁssion yeast is an important model species for
which various high-throughput ﬁinctional and genetic screens have
been performed (Kapitzky et al., 2010; Pancaldi et al., 2010; Roguev
et al., 2008). However, a comprehensive physical interactome is still
lacking. Hence, we applied our method to predict novel physical
interactions in ﬁssion yeast after training on high-conﬁdence
physical interactions from BioGRID, DIP, MINT, IntAct and KEGG
databases (Aranda et al., 2010; Ceol et al., 2010; Kanehisa et al.,

.S.Sara et al.

 

2010; Stark et al., 2011; Xenarios et al., 2000). We trained a two-
class classiﬁer for physical versus non-physical interactions, because
we did not have enough information on the training data for a more
ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation. We estimated the performance of the
classiﬁer using 5-fold cross-validation (Supplementary Fig. S6). We
selected a threshold that gives a precision of 0.8 on cross-validation,
yielding 2853 novel predicted interactions that are not in the positive
training set (Supplementary Table 2). The main source of evidence
for these interactions in STRING is text mining. The majority (2851)
of these interactions have text mining evidence, but only 246 have
another type of STRING evidence.

To validate the model further, we used a set of interactions mapped
from budding yeast using orthology, i.e. ‘interologs’ (Matthews
et al., 2001). We only mapped interologs for budding yeast proteins
with unique orthologs in ﬁssion yeast, resulting in 2586 mapped
interactions that are not present in the previous reference set.
The Random Forest model successﬁilly predicted 61% of these
interactions at a Random Forest probability threshold of 0.5.
Supplementary Figure S7 shows that predictions are enriched for
interactions mapped from budding yeast.

4 CONCLUSONS

We presented a method to predict physical PPIs based on a
ﬁinctional interaction network. Hence, the goal was not the de novo
prediction of interactions. Rather, links existing in the STRING
network were classiﬁed as being physical or ﬁinctional, etc. We
showed that features extracted from the topological properties of
the functional network can be used to predict physical binding, and
we systematically tested the importance of each of the seven features
for the prediction task. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that
network features help distinguishing different types of interactions.
Obviously, this approach can be extended in the ﬁiture to distinguish
even more different types of interactions (such as regulatory versus
structural), and it may be applicable to other types of networks (e.g.
transcriptional regulatory networks, micro RNA networks or genetic
networks).

We are aware of the shortcomings of our classiﬁcation in ‘stable’
protein complexes and ‘transient’ binary interactions. Complexes
are obviously dynamic and binary interactions can be stable.
Nevertheless, the Random Forest classiﬁer could distinguish these
classes, which we operationally deﬁned based on the experimental
techniques used. Our analysis suggests that these classes are at least
enriched for different types of interactions.

Finally, the application to ﬁssion yeast demonstrated that the
strategy outlined here can in fact be used to complement physical
interactomes in less studied model organisms. The latest version
of STRING generated ﬁinctional networks for about 1100 fully
sequenced organisms (Szklarczyk et al., 2011). Thus, there is a great
potential for predicting physical interactions based on the structure
of these networks.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Markov models are very popular for analyzing complex
sequences such as protein sequences, whose sources are
unknown, or whose underlying statistical characteristics are not
well understood. A major problem is the computational complexity
involved with using Markov models, especially the exponential
growth of their size with the order of the model. The probabilistic
suffix tree (PST) and its improved variant sparse probabilistic suffix
tree (SPST) have been proposed to address some of the key
problems with Markov models. The use of the suffix tree, however,
implies that the space requirement for the PST/SPST could still be
high.

Results: We present the probabilistic suffix array (PSA), a data
structure for representing information in variable length Markov
chains. The PSA essentially encodes information in a Markov model
by providing a time and space-efficient alternative to the PST/SPST.
Given a sequence of length N, construction and learning in the PSA
is done in 0(N) time and space, independent of the Markov order.
Prediction using the PSA is performed in 0(mlog‘g—‘) time, where
m is the pattern length, and E is the symbol alphabet. In terms
of modeling and prediction accuracy, using protein families from
Pfam 25.0, SPST and PSA produced similar results (SPST 89.82%,
PSA 89.56%), but slightly lower than HMMER3 (92.55%). A modified
algorithm for PSA prediction improved the performance to 91.7%, or
just 0.79% from HMMERS results. The average (maximum) practical
construction space for the protein families tested was 21.58i6.32N
(41.11N) bytes using the PSA, 27.55i13.16N (63.01N) bytes using
SPST and 47i24.95N (140.3N) bytes for HMMER3. The PSA was
255 times faster to construct than the SPST, and 11 times faster
than HMMER3.

1 INTRODUCTION

Markov models are often used for modeling complex sequences,
such as protein sequences, whose underlying statistical
characteristics are not well understood. This is especially the

case when the sequences exhibit short-term memory. For a short-
term memory of length, say L, the sequences can be modeled
using Markov models of order L, or using Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs; Ephraim et a1. (1989). The models provide efﬁcient
mechanisms to compute the required conditional probabilities, and
also for generating sequences from the models. The problem is that
the size of Markov models increases exponentially with increasing
memory length L. Thus, they are practical only for low-order
models with short-memory lengths. This leads to another problem:
such low-order Markov models often provide a poor approximation
of the true sequence being modeled. It is known that learning and
inference with HMMs is computationally very challenging (Abe
and Warmuth, 1992; Gillman and Sipser, 1994).

Probabilistic sufﬁx models such as probabilistic sufﬁx trees
(PSTs) have been proposed by Ron et a1. (1996) to address some
of the key problems with Markov models. They showed the
equivalence between PSTs and a subclass of probabilistic ﬁnite
automata (PFA) called probabilistic sufﬁx automata (PFA/PSA):
for a given PST, there is an algorithm to construct a PFA/PSA
whose size is the same as that of the PST within a constant factor.
Further, the distribution generated by a PST is guaranteed to be
within a small distance from that generated using the PSF/PSA, as
measured by the KullbaCk—Leibler divergence. Their probabilistic
sufﬁx models, however, require 0(LN2) time and space to construct,
where N is the sequence length. The algorithm to construct the
PFA/PSA from the PST also runs in 0(LN2) time. Later, (Apostolico
and Bejerano, 2000) showed how the PST can be constructed in
0(N) time, independent of the order L, using traditional sufﬁx links
used in constructing sufﬁx trees (STs), and the notion of reverse
sufﬁx links.

PSTs and probabilistic sufﬁx automatons are related to context-
based models which are extensively used in sequence prediction and
data compression. The use of these context models as a surrogate
for variable length Markov models with applications in sequence
prediction are reviewed in (Begleiter et al., 2004). Earlier, the PST
was used to model DNA sequences in (Ron et (11., 1996). Modeling
and prediction of protein families using the PST was reported in
(Bejerano and Yona, 2001; Leonardi, 2006). Importantly, using the
PST, prediction was performed without any prior alignment of the
protein sequences. (Leonardi, 2006) proposed an improved variation
of the PST, called sparse probabilistic sufﬁx tree (SPST) for use in
protein family prediction. Unlike the usual PST, the SPST allows
some contexts to be grouped together to form an equivalent class.
Essentially, this grouping results in a form of pruning of the PST,
however, the node depths are not ﬁxed, but could vary depending

on the sequence. In Leonardi (2006), it was shown that the SPST
resulted in an improved prediction accuracy, when compared with
the PST.

The use of the ST, however, also implies that the practical time
and space needed to construct or use the PST (or SPST) could be
very high, although it is still theoretically linear in terms of the
sequence length. Here, we present the PSA, a time and space-
efﬁcient alternative to the PST/SPST. The PSA provides all the
capabilities of the PST/SPST, such as learning and prediction,
and maintains the same linear time for construction. The PSA is,
however, signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than the SPST (in both space
and time), for both the construction stage and the prediction stage.

2 BACKGROUND

2.1 Sufﬁx trees and sufﬁx arrays

Given a string T=T[1,...,N] with symbol alphabet 2, its ST is a
rooted tree with N leaves, where the i-th leaf node corresponds to
the i-th sufﬁx T,- of T. Except for the root node and the leaf nodes,
every node must have at least two descendant child nodes. Each
edge in the ST represents a substring of T, and no two edges out of
a node start with the same character. For a given edge, the edge label
is simply the substring in T corresponding to the edge. We use 11- to
denote the i-th leaf node. Then, 11- corresponds to T), the i-th sufﬁx
of T. When the edges from each node are sorted lexicographically,
then 11- will correspond to TSAU], the i-th sufﬁx of T in lexicographic
order.

Some ST construction algorithms make use of suﬁx links. The
notion of sufﬁx links is based on a well-known fact about sufﬁx trees
(Gusﬁeld, 1997; McCreight, 1976), namely, if there is an internal
node u in ST such that its path label from the root LL(u)=aa for
some single character (16 2, and a (possibly empty) string a e 2*,
then there is a node v in ST such that LL(V) :01. A pointer from node
u to node v is called a suﬁix link. If a is an empty string, then the
pointer goes from u to the root node. Sufﬁx links are important in
certain applications, such as in computing matching statistics needed
in approximate pattern matching, regular expression matching or in
certain types of traversal of the ST.

A predominant factor in the space cost for STs is the number
of interior nodes in the tree, which depends on the tree topology.
A simple implementation of the ST, for instance using Ukkonen’s
algorithm (Ukkonen, 1995), can require as large as 33N bytes of
storage with sufﬁx links, or 25N bytes without sufﬁx links (Adjeroh
et al., 2008). Improved ST construction algorithms Kurtz (1999)
require 15.67N bytes on average, and 21N —29N bytes in the worst
case (includes 1 byte/symbol for input text), depending on whether
linked lists or hash tables were used for representing the nodes. These
do not include the extra space required for the auxiliary structures
needed for the PST.

The sufﬁx array (SA) provides a lexicographically ordered list
of all the sufﬁxes of a string. If SA[i] = j, it means that the i-th
smallest sufﬁx of T is Tj, the sufﬁx starting at position j in
T. A related structure, the LCP array contains the length of the
longest common preﬁxes between adjacent positions in the
SA. Combining the SA with the LCP (Longest Common
Preﬁx) information provides a powerﬁil data structure for
pattern matching. Worst-case linear-time direct SA construction
algorithms are described in Adjeroh and Nan (2010), Karkkainen

et al. (2006), Nong et al. (2009) and Puglisi et al. (2007).
A linear-time algorithm for constructing ST from SA is presented in
Adjeroh et al. (2008). Space-efﬁcient constructions for representing
the ST based on the SA have also been studied. Examples here
include the enhanced sufﬁx array (ESA; Abouelhoda et al., 2004;
Homann et al., 2009), linearized sufﬁx trees (LSTs; Kim et al., 2008)
and the virtual sufﬁx tree (VST; Lin et al., 2009). Compressed
index representations, such as compressed STs and compressed
SAs have also been studied (Grossi and Vitter, 2005; Sadakane,
2007; Valimaki et al., 2009). Much earlier, Kurtz (1999) proposed
direct methods for space-efﬁcient construction of the ST, without
using SAs. See Section 4.4 for further discussion on efﬁcient ST
representations. In this article, we focus on the use of standard SA
as the basis for the proposed probabilistic SAs.

2.2 Variable length Markov models

A Markov model is a sequence of stochastic events {Xm
n = 0, 1,2, 3, ...} with a state space that satisﬁes the Markov property:

P(Xn+1=j|Xn =i,Xn_1=in_1,...,X0=i0)
=P(Xn+1=j|Xn =i7Xn—1=in—17---7Xn—L =in—L)

where, L is the order of the model. Thus, in an order-L Markov
model, the current state is dependent on the past L states. Fixed
length Markov models (FLMMs) represent a probabilistic ﬁnite state
machine which can be used to model arbitrarily complex sequences.
Such models learn the probabilityP(a | C), the conditional probability
of a symbol a, given its contexts C, where a e 2 and C 6 21‘, L is
the order or memory length of the model, and is ﬁxed. The FLMM
of order L is represented as a 21‘ X 2 matrix. The space needed is
thus in 0(2Lt1).

Variable length Markov models (VLMMs) differ from FLMM
in an important way. VLMMs attempt to learn the conditional
distribution of a symbol where the context length or model order
could be varying, depending on the data being modeled. Essentially,
for VLMM, C e Ull‘zl 2i. This property of varying memory length
implies that with the VLMM, Markov dependencies of varying order
in the training data—both large and small—could be captured with
ease. This ﬂexibility of the VLMM, however, comes at a huge cost
in terms of space requirement. To represent a VLMM of order L, we
have to store L matrices, one for each order, from 1 to L. The total
space requirement will be in 0(22 + 23 + - - - + 2"“) or 0(2L+2).
The space is huge, even when L is small. Thus, the space requirement
for Markov models is exponential in L, whether we consider ﬁxed
length or variable length models.

An important observation that could point to a potential reduction
in the space requirement for Markov models is that for a given
sequence of length N, there are N (N + 1) /2 possible substrings in
the sequence. (The number of unique substrings is typically smaller,
and also depends on L, | 2| and the speciﬁc sequence.) Thus, there
are at most N (N + 1)/2 states that need to be represented in the
Markov model for the sequence, for any given order. For the length-
N sequence, the maximum order of a Markov model will be N — 1.
Thus, given the sequence, we can have a limit on the possible number
of states in its Markov model.

2.3 Probabilistic sufﬁx tree

The PST is based on the traditional sufﬁx tree. Like the sufﬁx tree, the
PST represents all the N (N + 1) / 2 substrings from the root to the leaf

nodes. The PST models VLMMs, which means that the string depth
is not ﬁxed for every node. For an FLMM, its corresponding PST
can be obtained from the PST of the VLMM by constraining each
leaf node to be of the same string depth. The transition probability of
a symbol on a given path is computed as the relative frequency of the
symbol in the observed data, given the preceding substring on the
path. The length of the substring used to determine such conditional
probabilities is simply given by the order of the model.

Consider the sample sequence T= accactact$. Figure 1
shows its ﬁrst-order transition matrix and the corresponding state
diagram. Figure 2 shows the sufﬁx tree and the corresponding PST.
The PST is shown for the case of order L = 3. In this PST, we label the
transition probabilities for each symbol. The transition probability
for a given symbol is calculated using the conditioning context.

The original PST algorithm (Ron et al., 1996) needed an 0(LN2)
time to construct and prune the PST from a sufﬁx tree. The improved
algorithm (Mazeroff et al., 2008) used balanced red—black trees
(Cormen et al., 1990) to construct the PST in 0(LNlogN) time
complexity. (Apostolico and Bejerano, 2000) presented an 0(N)
time algorithm using sufﬁx links and reverse sufﬁx links. (Leonardi,
2006) proposed an improved variation of the PST, called sparse
probabilistic sufﬁx tree (SPST) for use in protein family prediction.
The SPST differs from the PST in that the SPST models sparse
Markov chains (SMCs), whereby the conditioning contexts are
deﬁned by sparse sequences, that is, subset of sequences of amino
acids. In an SMC, some contexts can be grouped together to form an
equivalent class. In SPST, this grouping is performed by considering
the contexts with similar preﬁxes. This leads to a type of partitioning
of the contexts, based on their common preﬁxes. In practice, the
effect is essentially a form of pruning of the PST, whereby the node
depths are not ﬁxed, but could vary depending on the sequence. This
variability in node depths makes the SPST different from the PST
with ﬁxed order or node depth L [e.g. L: 20 in Bejerano and Yona
(2001)]. Results reported in Leonardi (2006) showed that the SPST
improved on PST prediction by ~2—4%, while maintaining the same
general time complexity.

2.4 Empirical probabilities via SAs

In Apostolico and Bej erano (2000); Ron et al. (1996), the conditional
probabilities required for the PST were computed as relative counts,
using empirical probabilities, based on symbol frequencies from the
observed data. To compute the empirical probabilities, we use the
notions of term frequency (TF) and document frequency (DF) as
used in information retrieval. The TF is simply the number of times
a given term (or substring in our case) occurred in a given sequence.
There are N(N+1)/2 substrings in a sequence of size N. Using a
naive algorithm, we will need to compute TFs for all the N (N + 1) / 2
terms. However, with the sufﬁx tree for this sequence, we have

N leaf nodes and at most N internal nodes. These 2N nodes represent
the N (N + 1) / 2 substrings in the sequence. Therefore, some multiple
substrings at different positions in the sequence must have been
represented by the same node. These substrings represented in the
same node must have the same frequency count. Since the node
labels are unique in the sufﬁx tree, this means that the multiple
substrings in the same node are essentially the same substring, that
was repeated multiple times along the sequence. Thus, each unique
substring forms a ‘group’, whereby group members essentially differ
in terms of their starting locations in the string T. While there are
0(N2) possible substrings in T, there are at most 0(N) unique
substrings (or groups). Hence, we need to compute the TF for only
the 2N unique substrings.

Yamamoto and Church (2001) presented a data structure, called
the interval array, to represent the groups as nodes in the sufﬁx
tree using a SA. For example, the substring ‘ac’ occurred three
times in the sample sequence shown in Figure 2a. This ‘ac’ group
corresponds to the interval < 1,3 > (Table 1). Using the interval
array, their algorithm calculated all the required TFs in 0(N)
time. Table 1 shows the interval array for the sample sequence
T= accactact$. From the table, we can describe two important
properties of the interval array (or substring groups).

(1) There are at most 2N groups in a sequence of size N.
Substrings in the same group have the same statistics (for
example: TF and DF) and the same derivative measurements.

(2) An lop-delimited interval < i, j > is constructed using the LCP
array, where (i, j) is an interval on the SA. An lop-delimited
interval < i, j > must meet the condition:
max(LCP[i] , LCP[]' + 1]) < Lengthgroupusj) f min(LCP[i +
1],LCP[i+2], ...,LCP[j])

where, Lengthgroupusj) is the LCP of the sufﬁxes that belong to the
same group with the < i, j > interval. Leta and (3 be two substrings
in the same lop-delimited interval <i, j >. Then, TF(a)=TF(f3)=
j— i+ 1.

3 METHOD—PSA

Previous work (Apostolico and Bejerano, 2000; Ron et al., 1996)
has represented Markov models and PFA using the PST. Here, we
present a space-efﬁcient data structure to represent such ﬁnite state
machines. We call our data structure the PSA, since it is built on
the SA data structure. The PSA uses an array of nodes to capture
the branching structure in the sufﬁx tree, and other auxiliary arrays
to maintain information needed for learning from the observed
data. Learning in the PSA is performed by computing conditional
probabilities at each node in the PSA using empirical probabilities
computed via the TF.

3.1 Data structure

Essentially, we use the probabilistic SA to simulate the PST. Each
node in the PST has a corresponding position in the PSA. The basic
PSA structure has three types of attributes. The ﬁrst category of
attributes is the foundation attributes, which consists of the original
text and its SA. Construction of the SA is in 0(N) time and space,
using any of the various linear-time, linear-space algorithms [see for
example Adjeroh and Nan (2010); Karkkainen et al. (2006); Nong
et al. (2009); Puglisi et al. (2007)].

See Figure 2a for the position of each interval in the sufﬁx tree.

The second category of attributes are the internal node attributes.
These are derived from the interval array, which is determined
following Yamamoto and Church (2001). These are used to represent
the internal nodes in the sufﬁx tree, including the sufﬁx links. The
sufﬁx link is the link from an internal node to its corresponding sufﬁx
node. The third type of attributes are measurement attributes. These
record measurement information, such as TF, DF and conditional
probabilities, which are needed to compute probabilities in the
Markov model. Table 2 shows the three types of attributes used
in the PSA. The TF can be calculated at run time. Thus the attribute
Conditional Probability ( cProb ) which is based on TF can be
computed also at run time. We use the term length of the PSA
(denoted by M) to refer to the number of nodes in the PSA. The
term length emphasizes the fact that our PSA nodes are stored as
arrays.

3.1.] Internal node attributes. The internal node attributes are
derived from the interval array. The pair <Start, End> represents
the interval position of a node in the SA. The PSA internal node
attributes are used to simulate the internal nodes in a sufﬁx tree. The
attribute sLink is a regular sufﬁx link from the current internal node
to its sufﬁx node. We use this link to continue the searching process
when a mismatch occurs at the time of prediction. The attribute
Parent is the parent node of the current node. The internal node
attributes including the sufﬁx link are constructed using Algorithm
BUILDPSA.

3.1.2 Measurement attributes. These attributes are dependent on
the application. For example, for applications in document feature
selection, or in protein sequence Classiﬁcation, we only compute
the TFs and the conditional probabilities (as needed) at run time,
using the formula (End—Start+ 1). In other applications, such
as protein sequence clustering, we may need to compute DF for the

classes, rather than just the DF. The attributes are also dependent
on the methods used in calculating the probabilities in the Markov
model. Thus, we focus on the method for computing the conditional
probabilities, and the probability of a node in the VLMM. For a
given node with node label, say (S 1, ...,S,,), its probability, PVLMM
is given by:

PVLMM=P(51.---.Sn)=P(Sn|517....Sn—i).--..P(52|51)P(Si) (1)

If S1,...,St_1St (with lfth ) does not occur in the training
data, we ﬁnd the longest sufﬁx of S1,...,St_1S; which occurred
in the training data. Assume Sk,...,St_1St (1 gkft) is the longest
sufﬁx of S1,...,St_1St that occurred, then P(St|S1,...,St_1)=
P(St|Sk,...,St_1). Thus,

TFSr .k=t
P(S,|Sl,...,s,_1)=P(s,|sk,...,s,_1)= TF

Here, TFM is the term frequency at the node with node label u.
We make two observations: First, if the terminal symbol S; of a
path Sk,...,St_1St is a ﬁrst symbol in an edge of the sufﬁx tree,
then the conditional probability P(St|Sk,...,St_1) is calculated by
the frequency of the current node divided by the frequency of the
parent node. Second, ifthe terminal symbol St ofa path Sk , ...,St_1St
is not a ﬁrst symbol in an edge of the sufﬁx tree, then the conditional

the tree-like structure used in the PSA. Step 2 constructs the interval
array (iArray) using the print_LDIs_s tack ﬁinction deﬁned in
Yamamoto and Church (2001). The next step maps each position
in the input sequence to its interval. This step calculates the parent
node of each node. The ﬁnal step computes the inverse SA. Using the
inverse SA the algorithm determines a link that allows the interval
array to point to the next position, based on which the the sufﬁx link
for each PSA node is determined.

A more detailed description of the PSA construction steps and
their computational complexity analysis can be found in Lin (2011).

probability P(S;|Sk, ...,St_1) is 1. We call this a trivial conditional
probability. Thus, we need to calculate the conditional probabilities
for only the ﬁrst symbol in each edge. When we determine that the
terminal symbol of path is not a ﬁrst symbol in an edge, we simply
return 1 for the conditional probability of the symbol.

3.1.3 Example PSA. Tables 3 and 4 show the nature of the PSA
nodes and the order-3 conditional probabilities in a PSA, using the
sequence T = accactact$ used in Figure 2. The entries in Table 3
are directly calculated from the interval array. We notice that P(c|a)
is 1. This indicates the substring ‘ac’ is represented on one edge and
that the terminal symbol ‘c’ is the second symbol on this edge. This
is a trivial conditional probability.

Entries in Table 4 are computed from the PSA leaf nodes. We
only showed the non-trivial conditional probabilities on the leaf
nodes. These conditional probabilities are calculated based on the
ﬁrst observation described in Section 3.1.2. The numerator is 1
since this is a leaf node which must have a frequency of 1. The
denominator is the frequency of the substring corresponding to the
node label of the parent of the current leaf node. This is easily
obtained as (End— Start+ 1) using the elements in the interval
array. The PSA nodes can be compared with the example PST shown
in Figure 2.

3.2 Constructing the PSA

Having described the building blocks for the PSA, we are now ready
to describe how we put them together to construct the PSA. For a
given input sequence, algorithm BUILDPSA uses ﬁve major steps to
construct the PSA data structure. The ﬁrst step is the construction
of the SA from the original sequence. We use standard linear-time,
linear-space algorithms for this step. The next two steps construct

3.3 Prediction with VLMM via the PSA

An important procedure in Markov models is to compute the
probability that a given test pattern is generated by the model.
This is particularly important in our problem of modeling protein
families using VLMMs. For instance, given a protein family with
some known sequences, one may be interested in Checking if a
given unknown protein sequence belongs to the family. This can
be done by ﬁrst constructing a model of the family (i.e. the PSA in
our case) using the known sequences. Given a protein family with
Z sequences, say T1,T2,...,TZ, this is performed by constructing
the PSA for the concatenated sequence: T=T1$1T2$2...TZ$Z.
To determine whether the unknown protein sequence belongs to
the family, we use the model to compute the probability that the
unknown sequence is generated by the model.

For the VLMM, we denote this probability as the PVLMM of the
input pattern. Algorithm VLMM-PREDICTION calculates the PVLMM
of a test sequence using the PSA data structure. This algorithm uses
Equation (1) to compute P(S1),P(S2|S1),... by searching for the
subpattems S1,S1S2,... When there is a mismatch while searching
with the subpattem, say Sk,...,St, the algorithm jumps to the node
pointed to by the sufﬁx link attribute of the current node. Thus,
matching proceeds from the node representing the sufﬁx S k+1 , ..., St,
after accounting for the preﬁx of this sufﬁx, which has already
been matched in the previous step. When a mismatch occurs, the
algorithm uses the previously computed index to determine the
sufﬁx link. Thus the search will be redirected to the new branch
following the sufﬁx link. The algorithm now uses the longest sufﬁx
of the subpattem that so far matched in the previous matching step
as the new subpattem, and restarts matching from the symbol that
mismatched. This redirection is a constant time operation.

The foregoing implies that, given a sequence T = T[1, ...,N], with
symbols from an alphabet 2, and the PSA for T, we can decide on
whether a pattern P=P[1,...,m] is generated by the same variable
length Markov chain that generated T in 0(mlog ‘NTQ time.

We can use the predicted probability above to perform protein
sequence Classiﬁcation. Suppose we have F protein families and
we have computed the PSA for each family. Let PSAk be the
model constructed using the k-th protein family. Further, let

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We performed experiments on protein sequences to test the proposed
PSA data structure. The experiments were performed using a DELL
PC, with 4 X 2.67 GHz CPU, and 8G memory, running Ubuntu 10.10
Linux operating system. All programs were compiled using gcc.

4.1 Predicting protein families

Gapped-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) provides a simple but popular
approach to protein family prediction. Perhaps the most popular
and accurate methods for protein family Classiﬁcation are based
on proﬁle HMMs, introduced in the 1990’s (Durbin et al., 1998;
Eddy, 2010). HMM is more accurate than BLAST, and also performs
better in detecting distant homologs. In (Bejerano and Yona, 2001),
the PST was compared with both Gapped-BLAST and an earlier
implementation of HMM, using the old Pfam 1.0 dataset (Bateman
et al., 2004). In terms of prediction accuracy, the PST generally
did better than BLAST, but under-performed HMM by ~2—5%
(90.7% Versus 91.5—96.1%). The PST was, however, much faster
than HMM for both training and searching. In Leonardi (2006), the
SPST was introduced as an improved variant of the PST, resulting in
~2% improvement in accuracy. The latest implementation of proﬁle
HMM is HMMER 3.0 http : / /hmmer . janelia . org/ (Eddy,
2010) which is now essentially as fast as BLAST, but more accurate.

Our major objective was to develop a time- and space-efﬁcient
alternative to the PST/SPST. To test the performance of PSA
in modeling protein sequences and in predicting the family for

Results are for the ﬁrst 48 protein families (listed alphabetically) with 12 or more
members in the Pfam 25.0 database. (TP denotes true positive, MD denotes missed
detection).

unknown sequences, we downloaded the current Pfam database
(release 25.0; Bateman et al., 2004; Finn et al., 2008). We use
family members from the unaligned sequences to generate the PSA,
one PSA for each family. We selected the ﬁrst 48 families with 12 or
more members (based on alphabetical ranking of the family names).
For each family, we selected the ﬁrst 1000 protein sequences (or all
sequences if family size <1000) to make up our dataset. The result
is a total of 46810 protein sequences from the 48 families. For
each family, we selected 80% of the protein sequences (37 448) for
training, used the remaining 20% (9362 sequences) for testing.

Below, we compare the proposed PSA with SPST (best
performing variant of PST), and HMMER 3 .0 (latest implementation
of proﬁle HMM).

For HMMER3, we use the e-value to decide to which family
a given test sequence should be assigned. Thus, in some cases
HMMER3 returns a ‘no match’, which we consider as a missed
detection. To use the PSA, for each sequence in the test dataset, we
compute the PVLMM using the PSA structure for each family. We
then assign the protein sequence to the family with the maximum
probability. When the maximum probability is obtained using the
model of the correct family (whose PSA is generated without the test
sequence), we say we have a correct Classiﬁcation (true positive),
otherwise, there is a Classiﬁcation error. This simple approach avoids
the difﬁcult problem of setting thresholds for correct Classiﬁcation.

Table 5 shows the summary Classiﬁcation performance on
the Pfam dataset using the PSA. Detailed Classiﬁcation results,
showing performance on each family are provided as Supplementary
Table S1 . For comparison, we have also included the results obtained
using the SPST and HMMER3 on the same dataset. As expected,
both SPST and PSA produced comparable results with respect to
modeling and Classiﬁcation of protein families. The SPST had an
average true positive rate of 89.82%, whereas the PSA had 89.56%.
These were just ~3% lower than the average performance (namely
92.55%) obtained using HMMER 3.0. We performed a harder test,
by using 20/80 data partitioning (rather than 80/20) for training
versus testing. The overall true positive rate was reduced for each
of the three schemes (PSA 85.40%, SPST 84.49% and HMMER3
89.91%; see Supplementary Table S2). The results, however, show
that with respect to prediction accuracy, SPST and PSA are not
signiﬁcantly worse than HMMER3, the current state-of-the-art, even
under the more challenging scenario of 20/80 split for training versus
test1ng.

To evaluate the impact of increasing database set size and diversity
on the PSA performance, we selected 1000 protein families with
1000 or more members in Pfam. For each family, we selected the
ﬁrst 1000 protein sequences to make up our dataset. The result is
a total of 1 000 000 protein sequences from the 1000 families. For
each family, we selected 80% of the protein sequences (800 000)
for training, used the remaining 20% (200 000 sequences) for
testing. We compare the performance of the proposed PSA with
that of HMMER3 on the large dataset. The performance decreased
somewhat, for both HMMER3 and PSA. The performance for
PSA changed from 89.56% (for F :48 families) to 87.10% (for
F = 1000 families), or a decrease of 2.46%. However, HMMER3
showed a less performance decrease of ~1% [from 92.55% (F =
48) to 91.58% (F = 1000)]. Detailed comparative results, showing
the Classiﬁcation performance on each family are provided as
Supplementary Table S4.

One advantage of performing Classiﬁcation using Equation (3),
is that, when there is an error in the Classiﬁcation, we can consider
the family with the next highest predicted probability. For instance,
we can consider the top-k Classiﬁcation rate, which shows the
probability of ﬁnding the correct protein family within the ﬁrst k
families, as ordered based on their generated probabilities, using the
test sequence. Figure 3 shows the Classiﬁcation performance of the
PSA on some sample families, using the top-k Classiﬁcation rate. We
can observe how the Classiﬁcation performance rapidly approaches
100% after the ﬁrst few k-values.

4.2 Space consideration

A major problem with sufﬁx trees is their practical memory space
requirement. Although, they have the same theoretical linear space
requirement as SAs, in practice, sufﬁx trees consume much more
space (Adjeroh et al., 2008; Gusﬁeld, 1997; Puglisi et al., 2007).
This was our primary motivation for developing the PSA. Table 6
shows the summary data on the protein families in Pfam 25.0 used
in our experiments. Table 7 compares the memory space required to
construct the SPST and HMM with that required for the PSA.
First, we can observe the nature of the protein sequences (Table 6).
The maximum branching factor (y = %) observed was 0.687,

whereas the minimum was 0.432. The average was 0.538. The
branching factor provides an indication of the nature of the sequence.
Higher values typically indicate less repetition in the sequence. As a
key performance measure, we used the memory consumption factor
(MCF), deﬁned as the ratio of the required memory to the total
sequence length (N) of the family. We compared the MCF for PSA,
SPST and HMMER3. Table 7 shows that the PSA ratio was steady
at about (21.58 :l:6.32N) bytes. The maximum memory required by
the PSA for any of the families was 42.11N bytes. This can be
compared with the (mean and maximum) memory needed for SPST
(27.55:l:13.16N,63.01N) and HMMER3 (47:l:24.95N,140.3N).
Supplementary Figure S1 shows more detailed information on the
memory consumption needed to construct the data structures, using
the Pfam 25.0 protein families. We can observe that the minimum
MCF for HMMER3 was larger that the average MCF for PSA.
Table 8 shows the corresponding MCF for the three schemes during
the time of prediction (testing).

Perhaps, more signiﬁcantly, while the PSA memory is relatively
constant independent of the sequence or family, we can observe
the signiﬁcant ﬂuctuation in the memory needed for the SPST and
HMMER3, as captured by the range and SD on the MCF. This
relative stability can be observed during both PSA construction and
PSA prediction. For the dataset, the PSA required an average MFC
of (13.6N :l:0.96) and a maximum MFC of 16N for storage, after
construction.

4.3 Computational time requirement

Table 9 shows the summary of the time required for constructing the
PSA and the PST data structures. Table 10 shows the corresponding
summary of the time needed for prediction using the models. The
tables show that for prediction, on average, the PSA was ~10.8
times faster to build than HMMER3, and ~255 times faster than
constructing SPST. For prediction, the PSA was ~371 times faster
than SPST.

4.4 Discussion

The proposed data structure is based on the stande SA, and
hence can be implemented using compressed index structures
such as compressed sufﬁx arrays (CSAs; Grossi and Vitter, 2005;
Sadakane, 2007; Valimaki et al., 2009). Grossi and Vitter (2005)
showed that for a general alphabet, 2, with |2| >2, the CSA
can be constructed in 0(Nlog121N) processing time and stored

in ((1 + %loglog121N)Nlog| 2| +5N+0 <$)) bits, such that

each lookup operation can be performed in 0(loglog121N) time.

Similarly, in theory, the PST or SPST can be implemented using
compressed sufﬁx trees (CSTs). (Sadakane, 2007) showed that a CST
with ﬁill functionality (including sufﬁx links) can be constructed
in 0(N) time, and represented using 0(Nlog|2|) bits of storage
space. He showed that the CST can be implemented using (NH), +
6N +o(N)) bits, where H), is the order-h entropy of the original
sequence. For the CSA, the storage requirement can be reduced

to (NHh+O<W) bits. These will no doubt result in a

lower memory requirement when compared with our current result
using standard SAs. However, apart from the usual slowdown in
processing speed using CSAs or CSTs, some types of traversals and
new attributes required for the PSA (or PST/SPST) could be quite
difﬁcult to implement on a standard CSA (or CST). This type of
improvement will be an interesting direction for further work on
space-efﬁcient probabilistic sufﬁx structures. The proposed method

is not directly affected by the computer word length (32 bit or 64
bit), so far as the data structure including input data can ﬁt into main
memory. For very large datasets where this may not be the case,
methods will need to be considered for more efﬁcient I/O operations
(Ferragina, 2010).

In terms of prediction accuracy, a potential approach to improve
the performance will be to consider prediction based on short
fragments of the test sequence. These will provide more locality
in the analysis, and hence may be able to improve the ability
for detecting distant homology. One way to use the predictions
from different fragments will be to choose the one with the
family with the maximum predicted probability over all the
fragments as the predicted family. However, other approaches
are also possible, for instance by combining the predictions
using some well deﬁned protocol. We tested this approach, using
overlapping windows of various sizes, w. The best results were
obtained at w = 10 (86.80%) using average of window probabilities,
and at w=80 (91.76%) using the maximum probability. Table
11 provides a summary of the results, showing that with the
improvement, the average PSA prediction accuracy is now <0.8%
below that of HMMER3. Detailed results are in Supplementary
Table S1.

Further, as can be seen from the results (Supplementary Tables
S1 and S2), there are cases where the PSA performed signifcantly
better than HMM, e.g. by as much as 40% for FAD_binding_3 or
59% (for FA_hydroxylase). Thus, a potential improvement could
be obtained by combining prediction results from the PSA with
those from non-PST-based methods, such as the proﬁle HMM, for
instance, using an approriate classiﬁer fusion scheme (Kittler et al.,
1998).

We acknowledge some basic problems with using VLMMs in
general (whether PST, SPST or PSA). One problem is that these
tend to provide a global characterization of the sequence, and hence
may have problems when similarity between sequences is localized
within a smaller region of the proteins, or is interspersed between
islands of non-similar regions. This will thus affect the ability to
detect distant homology, or the ability to handle a previously unseen
mutation in a protein sequence that is being analyzed. This last
problem is akin to the zero-frequency-problem, and various methods
have been proposed, for instance, using a default probability
distribution, or a Poisson process model (Witten and Bell, 1997).
A related problem with the current PSA implementation is that the
conditioning context for the symbol probability reverts to the longest
observed sufﬁx, meaning that the conditional probability would be
based on a small number of counts. This may not always correspond
to the true probability. One solution would be to use some kind of

interpolation scheme, in which the probabilities are estimated based
on shorter preﬁxes, for instance, bigrams or trigrams. Though these
may still not always provide the true probabilities, the estimates
are likely to be closer to the true values, and also likely to be
more robust. This approach is somewhat similar to the successive
reduction in context size as used in context models such as prediction
by partial matching (PPM) (Cleary and Teahan, 1997; Cleary and
Witten, 1984; Zhang and Adjeroh, 2008) used in effective data
compression. Another approach is to use approximate matching
in evaluating the similarity between preﬁxes, rather than exact
matching as is used in the current implementation. (Lin, 2011)
provides some more discussions on improvements on the prediction
strategy.

We mention one issue with the current implementation of protein
family prediction using the PSA. Currently, the family with the
highest probability as reported by PVLMMO is always chosen as
the predicted family [see Equation (3)]. This means that, there is
no signiﬁcance attached to the prediction, and that the system must
report a prediction for any given test sequence. Thus, when the test
sequence does not belong to any of the families in the training set, the
assignment must necessarily be in error. This problem can be reduced
by including a mechanism that can return a ‘no match’ (similar to
HMMER3), for instance, based on some measure of conﬁdence
on the prediction. Using the PSA approach, one simple way to
do this will be to consider the maximum and second maximum
probabilities returned by PVLMMO. If the difference between the
two is above a certain threshold, the system will report a prediction
(i.e. family with the maximum probability). Otherwise, it reports a
‘no match’.

5 CONCLUSION

We have presented the PSA, a data structure for representing
information in VLMMs. The PSA provides the same ﬁinctionality as
the PST, but at a signiﬁcantly reduced time and space requirement.
Given a sequence of length N, construction and learning in the
PSA is done in 0(N) time and 0(N) space, independent of
the Markov order. Prediction using the PSA is performed in
0 (mlog  time, where m is the pattern length, and 2 is the
symbol alphabet.

We have shown practical results on the comparative performance
of PSA, SPST and HMMER3 using protein families from Pfam
25.0. In terms of modeling and prediction, SPST and PSA produce
equivalent results (SPST 89.82%, PSA 89.56%). These were slightly
lower than the 92.55% obtained using HMMER3 on the same
dataset. An improved version of PSA prediction (predicting families
using fragments from the test sequence) improved PSA perfomance
to 91.7%, thus reducing the performance gap with HMMER3 to just
0.79%.

The average practical construction space for the protein families
tested was 21 .58:l: 6.32N bytes using the PSA, 27.55 :l:13.16N bytes
using SPST and 47:l:24.95N bytes for HMMER3. The maximum
practical space needed was 42.11N for PSA, 63.01N for SPST and
140.3N for HMMER3. With respect to construction time, the PSA
was 255 times faster than SPST, and 11 times faster than HMMER3.
Our results show that, the PSA provides an accuracy similar to that
of PST/SPST and HMMER3 in protein family prediction, but at a
signiﬁcantly lower time and space requirement.

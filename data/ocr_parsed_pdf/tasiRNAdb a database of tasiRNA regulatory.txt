information for each pathway is showed in six sections: species,
phase initiator, T AS, ta—siRNA, targeted gene and reference(s),
and the basic information for each section is further hyperlinked
to a dynamic page (Supplementary Fig. S1). To only show the data
that meet the criteria that users specify, the contents of the table can
also be sorted and/or ﬁltered by species, phase initiator, T AS,
tasiRNA, targeted gene, and references. ‘tasiRNAdbSearch’ and
‘TasEprnalysis’ are two online tools developed to use the
archived data. They can respectively search the tasiRNAdb and
evaluate whether a T AS of interest is transcribed and cleaved to
produce ta—siRNA in user—sequenced sRNA dataset.

2.3 The TasEprnalysis tool

For researchers who have generated sRNAs sequence libraries, a
major challenge is to evaluate whether an interesting T AS among
the sRNA reads is cleaved by a phased—initiator and sliced by
DCL4 at every ~21 nt relative to the phase—initiator cleavage site
to produce functional ta—siRNAs. To meet this need, we de—
veloped the TasEprnalysis tool (Supplementary Fig. S2) and
integrated it into tasiRNAdb.

TasEprnalysis maps the sRNA and degradome reads sub—
mitted by the user to a selected/input T AS, and checks whether
the 5/ end of the RNA degradome fragment overlaps the T AS
cleavage start position. When an overlap is detected, TasEprna—
lysis searches the sRNA dataset to ﬁnd a phased initiator. Next,
the numbers of phased/non—phased positions with a sRNA hit on
the T AS are counted (phased positions refer to those arranged in
~21—nt increments relative to the cleavage start position; non—
phased positions are all other positions that are not phased pos—
itions or the start position). The P value of the detected conﬁgur—
ation is calculated based on a random hypergeometric distribution
using the following equation (Zhang et al., 2012, 2013):

min((k1+kg),(ﬁx27l))

Pam = Z

 

x=k1
<(Lx2—1)—(%><2—1)—(2—L1><2— 1) ><(2XS))<2L1><2— 1)
k2 k1
(LX2—l)—(%X2—1)X(2XS)
k1+k2 )

where L is the length of T AS; k1 is the number of phased pos—
itions having sRNA hits; k2 is the number of non—phased pos—
itions having sRNA hits; and s is the maximum allowed offset
from the phase position

The TasEprnalysis counts the number of unique sRNA and
sRNA reads on different phasing registers and the number of
different length reads in the user—submitted sRNA dataset.

All the detected results are reported in a result page
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

3 DISCUSSION

tasiRNAdb is an integrated database comprising a large number
of known ta—siRNA cascade pathways. Our aim in developing
tasiRNAdb was to collect known plant ta—siRNA cascade path—
ways and integrate them in such a way that the data could be freely
accessed and mined by users. tasiRNAdb is different from other
similar resources because it includes all plant species for which

such information is available. For example, ASRP currently col—
lects Arabidopsis T AS genes and aims mainly to provide a public
resource for genome—wide sRNA data from Arabidopsis
(Backman et al., 2008). MPSS aims to provide a signature—based
transcriptional resource for analyses of mRNA and sRNA
(Nakano et al., 2006) and currently contains Arabidopsis T ASs
and rice T ASs. CSRDB is a database of rice and maize sRNAs,
which aims to identify miRNAs and other functional sRNAs, map
miRNA transcription units, during development and as a function
of biotic and abiotic stress (Johnson et al., 2007). Our tasiRNAdb
currently contains 583 known ta—siRNA cascade pathways from
18 plant species, comprising 120 pairs of phased initiators and
their targeted sites, 77 ta—siRNA—generating loci, 457 pairs of ta—
siRNAs and their targeted sites and 296 ta—siRNAs target genes.
Consequently, tasiRNAdb provides more ta—siRNAs cascade
pathway information than ASRP, MPSS or CSRDB. Moreover,
web—based tools for evaluating whether a known/input T AS is
cleaved by phased—initiator and sliced by DCL4 at 21—nt intervals
to produce functional ta—siRNAs in user—sequenced sRNA data—
sets are unavailable. We have developed TasEprnalysis to meet
this need. We evaluated the performance of TasEprnalysis with
an RDR sRNA MPSS library (Lu et al., 2006) and default par—
ameters. All six atTASs previously reported in the sample, includ—
ing atTASla, atTASIb, atTASlc, atTASZ, atTAS3a and
at1g63130, were successfully identified by TasEprnalysis
(Supplementary Table S2). They all have a signiﬁcant P value of
<0.005. In addition, the other two known atTASs stored in
tasiRNAdb, including atT A531) and atTAS3c, were also identified
by TasEprnalysis. TasEprnalysis could be a useful tool for
characterizing sRNAs from deep sequencing data.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Kinesin is a smart motor protein that steps processively
forward and backward along microtubules (MTs). The mechanical
kinetics of kinesin affecting its stepping behavior is not fully under-
stood. Here, we propose a mathematical model to study the mech-
anical kinetics of fonNard and backward stepping of kinesin motor
based on the four-state discrete stochastic model of the motor.
Results: Results show that the probabilities of fonNard and backward
stepping can be modeled using the mean probabilities of forward and
backward kinetic transitions, respectively. We show that the backward
stepping of kinesin motor starts when the probability of adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) binding to the motor is much higher than that of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding. Furthermore, our results indi-
cate that the backward stepping is related to both ATP hydrolysis and
synthesis with rate limiting factor being ATP synthesis. Low rate of
ATP synthesis under high backward loads above 10 pN is also sug-
gested as a reason for the detachment of kinesin motor from MT in the
kinetic state MT>Kinesin>ADP>Pi.

1 INTRODUCTION

Kinesin-1, which will be referred to as kinesin hereafter, is a two-
headed motor protein that advances unidirectionally along a
microtubule (MT) in discrete 8.2 nm steps (Clancy et al., 2011)
by walking in an asymmetric hand-over-hand fashion Wildjz
et al., 2004, 2008). Kinesin can processively step forward and
backward along an MT (Carter and Cross, 2005), taking approxi-
mately 100 steps before detaching from the MT (Clancy et al.,
2011). Experimental investigation of kinesin processivity has re-
vealed that kinesin can undergo discrete steps in the presence of
fuel, i.e. adenosine triphosphate (ATP), or in the absence of ATP,
if external load is applied to the motor Wildiz et al., 2008).

The signiﬁcance of studying the mechanical kinetics underlying
stepping of kinesin motor becomes apparent when considering
the important roles the motor plays ranging from human diseases
to synthetic nanotechnological applications and the development
of novel active nanodevices. Molecular biology have revealed
critical roles of kinesin motor in brain wiring and formation,
neuronal survival, higher brain function and control of central

nervous system (Hirokawa et al., 2010). It is also evident that the
impairment of these functions of kinesin motor would contribute
to neuronal disease pathogenesis, such as Alzheimer (Stokin et al.,
2005) and hereditary spastic paraplegia (Ebbing et al., 2008), and
other diseases such as cancer (Y u and Feng, 2010). Kinesin step-
ping can also exert localized forces on nanostructures. This force
can be exploited in nanorobotics (Hess, 2006). Thus, engineers
have commenced to invent synthetic nanodevices powered by
kinesin motor that have unique potentials for use in medical diag-
nostics as well as engineering applications (Fischer et al., 2009;
Goodman et al., 2012; Hess, 2011; Kumar et al., 2013; Sanchez
et al., 2012). However, precise temporal and spatial control of
such nanodevices is a challenging problem because of the stochas-
tic motion, high complexity and small size of kinesin (Khataee
and Ibrahim, 2012; Khataee et al., 2013; Wang and Manesh,
2010). Even though the biophysical properties of kinesin motor
have been widely studied, yet little is known about how the mech-
anical kinetics of kinesin affect its stepping behavior in the
complex cellular environment (V erhey et al., 2011). Better under-
standing of the mechanical kinetics of kinesin stepping may trans-
late into the development of molecular-targeted therapy for
various human diseases (Hirokawa et al., 2010; Yu and Feng,
2010) and precise motion control for artiﬁcial nanomotors with
a wide variety of missions (Wang and Manesh, 2010).

Mathematical modeling can be used to not only conceptualize
and characterize kinesin behavior under different experimental
settings, but also to make predictions for novel applications. One
major theoretical approach for the modeling of kinesin motor
motion is based on a multistate discrete stochastic model and the
assumption that a single stepping of the motor involves passing
through a sequence of discrete kinetic states connected by revers-
ible transition rates (Fisher and Kolomeisky, 2001; Kolomeisky
and Fisher, 2007). Here, we mathematically model and analyze
the mechanical kinetics of ATP-driven stepping behavior of kine-
sin motor over a discrete stochastic model at various forward
(negative) and backward (positive) loads and ATP concentra-
tions ([ATP]) at room temperature (forward and backward
steps are taken toward the plus and minus ends of MT, respect-
ively). We show that our mathematical model can be used to ana-
lyze, conceptualize and predict forward and backward stepping
of kinesin motor in different situations.

single stepping cycle of the motor as passing through a sequence
of four kinetic states where state (1) may transit to states (i+ 1)
and (i — 1) with forward and backward transition rates u,- and w,,
i=0, 1, 2, 3, respectively:

(0)  (1)  (2)  (3)  (o)
|<—d0 —>|<— d1 —>|<— d2 —>|<—d3 —>|

In this discrete stochastic model, the intermediate kinetic states
of the model are denoted as M-K, M-K-ATP, M-K-ADP-Pi and
M-K-ADP, respectively, where M-K designates MT-kinesin
complex and ADP-Pi complex stands for the products of ATP
hydrolysis: adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phos-
phate (Pi). The d,- represents the substep length for the center
of force of kinesin along MT, where the total step size is
d=(d0+d1+d2+d3).

It has been shown that the rates of transitions between
kinetic states are inﬂuean by the temperature T (Leibler
and Huse, 1993) and external load F (Fisher and Kolomeisky,

2001) as:

where LIEU) and wgo) are the transition rates at zero load, 6? and 6;

are the load distribution factors, d is the step size (equal to
8.2 nm) and k3 is the Boltzmann constant. The load distribution
factors demonstrate how the external load affects the individual
kinetic rates where it is assumed that 21:0 (6:r + 6,7) = 1. These
factors are related to substep lengths Via d,- =  + 6,;1)d
(Kolomeisky and Fisher, 2007). The parameter values of
Equations (1) and (2) summarized in Table 1 as well as the par-
ameter values of [ATP]-dependent rates presented in Equations
(3) and (4) have been estimated by Fisher and Kolomeisky (2001)
through regression on the experimental data of Block et a]. in
Schnitzer et a]. (2000) and Visscher et a]. (1999) at room
temperature:

where k0: 1.8uM_1s_1, k’0=0.225uM_1s_1 and c0: 16 uM.
The four-state discrete stochastic model asserts that forward
stepping of kinesin motor is associated with ATP hydrolysis,
whereas backward stepping could give rise to ATP synthesis.
Our mathematical model indicates that the backward stepping
of kinesin motor is related to both ATP hydrolysis and synthesis.
In discussing backward stepping under high backward loads,
Carter and Cross (2005) stated that backward stepping is un-
likely to result in ATP synthesis. However, Fisher et a]. (2005)
remarked that the experimental observations in Carter and Cross
(2005) rest on a misconception of the significance of dwell times
before forward and backward stepping, and asserted that
backward stepping could result in ATP synthesis. In addition,

Yildiz et a]. (2008) have shown that kinesin motor can step in the
direction of the applied external load in the absence of ATP due
to the strain on the kinesin head generated by the external load.
Although the external load was able to trigger stepping in the
absence of ATP, our work focuses on the ATP-driven stepping
of kinesin motor and we study the effect of [ATP] and loads on
the forward and backward stepping. [ATP] is considered as a
factor that affects the motor velocity at various loads
(Schnitzer et al., 2000; Visscher et al., 1999) and thus, it affects
the mean waiting time over kinetic states modeled in this work.
In several recent works, [ATP] is proposed as a mean for tem-
poral control of synthetic nanodevices powered by kinesin motor
(Dinu et al., 2007; Wang and Manesh, 2010).

Equations (1) and (2) show that the rates of forward and
backward transitions change under different loads, [ATP] and
temperatures. We expect this rate change to change the probabil-
ities of triggering these transitions, as well as the mean
waiting time and the probability distribution over each kinetic
states. We define the probabilities of forward and backward
transitions in terms of the forward and backward transition
rates as follows:

in
Pm) =:— (s)

Pm) =+ <6)
‘ up + w

where i = 0, 1, 2, 3. Using the forward and backward transition
rates, the mean waiting time in kinetic state s,- (i = 0, 1, 2, 3) can
be deﬁned as follows:

1

080) =  (7)

Equation (7) defines the mean waiting time over the four
kinetic states of kinesin motor during forward and backward
stepping processes. We also define the stationary distribution
of probability over each kinetic states of kinesin motor using
the Hill’s diagram method (Kurka and Dvorak, 1982), where a
kinetic state change diagram is represented as a graph. Let G be a
connected and directed graph with vertex set V(G) and edge set
E(G), which represent kinetic states and transitions of the four-
state discrete stochastic model of kinesin motor, respectively. The
edge weights of G correspond to transition rates of the discrete

and 2,0,“, is the sum of all 2,. D is deﬁned as a directional
diagram of a vertex v if for any vertex xe V(D) and x 75 v, there is
exactly one path from x to v. Collectively, the mathematical
model of the mechanical kinetics of stepping behavior of kinesin
motor protein shows the behavior of the motor changes in re-
sponse to changes in the environment.

2.2 Analysis and discussion

Experimental determinations reported the stall force of kinesin
motor as a load ranging between $7.5 pN (Carter and Cross,
2005; Nishiyama et al., 2002; Visscher et al., 1999; Yildiz et al.,
2008). It was observed in Carter and Cross (2005) and Nishiyama
et al. (2002) that (i) below stall, forward stepping of kinesin
motor is dominant, (ii) at stall, the forward and backward step-
ping are equally likely and (iii) above stall, backward stepping is
more frequent. To model the probabilities of forward and back-
ward stepping of kinesin motor, we deﬁne the mean probabilities
of forward and backward kinetic transitions as follows:

3 .
(POO) = Z? (9)

[:0

3 .
lP(w)) = 2 y (10)

[:0

where P(u,-) and P(w,-) are the probabilities of forward and back-
ward transitions given by Equations (5) and (6). Figure lAiC
shows the mean probabilities of forward and backward kinetic
transitions at loads over the range —10 prF 5 32 pN. We
define load F: —10 pN as the supremum forward load where
at this point and beyond, <P(u))>0.99 and <P(w))<0.01.
Similarly, the supremum backward load is deﬁned at load
F: 32 pN where at this point and beyond, <P(w))>0.99 and
<P(u))<0.01. From Figure lAiC, we observe that with increas-
ing load from forward to backward, the mean forward transition
probability <P(u)) decreases from almost 1 and intersects with the
mean backward transition probability <P(w)) at load between 778
pN, beyond which <P(w)) becomes dominant. Therefore, the stall
force (lel) of kinesin motor can be obtained by solving equa-
tion <P(u)) : <P(w)) at various [ATP]. Our results show an almost
constant and [ATP]-independent stall force of lel~ 7.3 pN, in
agreement with the experimentally measured stall force between
577.5 pN (Carter and Cross, 2005; Nishiyama et al., 2002;
Visscher et al., 1999; Yildiz et al., 2008). These results are also
consistent with the experimental observations that stall force of
kinesin motor is independent of [ATP] (Carter and Cross, 2005;
Clancy et al., 2011). Our obtained Fm” also agrees with the ex-
perimental results of Nishiyama et a]. (2002) in which the prob-
abilities of forward and backward stepping intersect at load

around 778 pN. Figure lAiC also indicates that the mean
probabilities of forward and backward transitions are almost
[ATP]-independent. This is consistent with the observed [ATP]-
independent but load dependent probabilities of forward and
backward stepping by Nishiyama et a]. (2002). It was reported
that under forward loads of — 15 pr F 5 —2 pN only forward
stepping was observed (Carter and Cross, 2005), but with
increasing backward loads the probability of observing back-
ward stepping increases (Nishiyama et al., 2002). These experi-
mental observations agreed with our results in Figure lAiC as
over the forward load ranging from —10 prF5 —2 pN,
<P(u))>0.98 and <P(w))<0.02, whereas with increasing back-
ward load the probability <P(w)) increases. In addition, our cal-
culations show that at loads over the range OfFf 8 pN and
at various [ATP], <P(u)) decreases from>0.95 to~0.48 (see
Fig. lAiC). This is in good agreement with the reported prob-
abilities for forward stepping of 1 and 0.5 at the respective loads
of F :0 pN and F :8 pN by Taniguchi et a]. (2005). These
agreements of our model with experimental findings indicate
that the probabilities of forward and backward stepping of kine-
sin motor can be modeled well using the mean probabilities of
forward and backward transitions deﬁned in Equations (9) and
(10), respectively.

To further analyze the probabilities of forward and backward
stepping of kinesin motor using kinetic transitions, we separ-
ately examine the probabilities of forward and backward kinetic
transitions given by Equations (5) and (6) (see Fig. 1]}F).
Figure 1]}F shows that with increasing load from high forward
to backward loads at all [ATP], P(w0) is the ﬁrst backward prob-
ability function that intersects its corresponding forward prob-

ability function P(u0). As only transition rates ugmand wgnare
[ATP]-dependent, the minimum load at which P(u0) intersects
with P(w0) at [ATP]:5uM is F :1.987 pN (Fig. 1D). At
[ATP]: 100 uM and [ATP]:2mM, the crossover load points
of P(u0) and P(w0) are found to be at F :2.754 pN and
F: 4.034 pN, respectively (Fig. 1E and F). These results indicate
that at limiting [ATP] the probability of forward stepping is
almost equal to 1 when the applied load is <1.987 pN because
at loads F < 1.987 pN all the probabilities P(ui) are greater than
P(wi), i : 0, 1, 2, 3 (see Fig. 1D). Similarly, at high [ATP] almost
all steps are made in the forward direction when the applied load
is <4.034 pN (see Fig. 1F). This is in good agreement with the
experimental observations of Nishiyama et a]. (2002) that at
loads lower than 4 pN the probability of forward stepping
is almost equal to 1. In analyzing the probabilities of [ATP]-
independent kinetic transitions, we explore their respective for-
ward and backward kinetic transitions. Equation (1) is capable
of showing that with increasing load from high forward to back-

ward, ugf) and it?) rates fall equally, as they have the same par-
ameters (see Table 1), whereas they are lower than the decreasing

dominates the probability of ADP release, i.e. P(uz) 3 P(u3), with
a large difference. The low probability of ADP release agrees
with the results of Hackney in Hackney (1988, 2005) where
they observed that the rate limiting factor of ATPase activity

of kinesin motor is the ADP release. Also, as wgnis equal to

win , P(ul) falls between P(uz) and P(u3), indicating that Pi release
is at least as fast as ATP hydrolysis (Hackney, 2005). Similarly,

the slow rise of w? leads to lowering the rise of P(wz) in com-
parison with P(w3), conﬁrming that Pi binding rate is faster than
the ATP synthesis rate (Hackney, 2005). P(w1)3 P(wz) also in-
dicates that the rate of ATP dissociation is higher than that of
ATP synthesis, as win 3 war).

The forward and backward stepping processes of kinesin
motor start from kinetic state ‘0’ by the forward and backward
transitions rates ugmand wgm, respectively. As forward stepping
of kinesin motor switch to backward at loads F > Fm”, we exam-
ine P(uo) and P(wo) at F :Fm”. Our calculations show that
P(w0)>0.97 and P(u0)<0.03 at load range F > F m”. This result
implies that the backward stepping of kinesin motor starts when
the probability of ADP binding to the motor is much higher than
that of ATP binding. The crossover load points of probabilities
of [ATP]-independent kinetic transitions are also calculated at
loads: (i) F: 6.515 pN for P(u3) and P(w3), (ii) F: 8.795 pN
for P(ul) and P(wl) and (iii) F: 17.102 pN for P(uz) and
P(wz). However, we are not able to relate these crossover load
points with the available experimental data because in current
experiments, [ADP] and [Pl] are not separately measured (Fisher
and Kolomeisky, 2001). The result obtained by separately exam-
ining the probabilities of [ATP]-independent kinetic transitions
illustrates that the probability of ATP hydrolysis, P(ul), is higher
than that of ATP synthesis, P(wz), at loads lel< F < 13 pN. At
this load range, Figure lAiC indicates that the backward step-
ping of the kinesin motor is more probable than forward step-
ping. This result suggests that the backward stepping of kinesin

motor is related to ATP hydrolysis as experimentally observed in
Carter and Cross (2005) and Nishiyama et a]. (2002).

What gives rise to the [ATP]-dependent detachment of kinesin
from MT? Equation (7) enables us to model the mean waiting
time over the four kinetic states of kinesin motor during forward
and backward stepping processes at different [ATP] and loads
(Fig. 2). The results show that at [ATP] : 5 uM and low loads the
mean waiting time in kinetic state ‘0’ is greater than that of other
states and peaks at a maximum of 0.1055s at F: 1.148 pN in
comparison with a maximum of 0.0063 s at F :2 pN and
[ATP]: 100 uM (see Fig. 2A and B). These results are consistent
with experimental findings as at limiting [ATP], kinesin is paused
at M-K kinetic state, waiting for ATP binding (Clancy et al.,
2011; Hackney, 1994). It has been observed by Schnitzer et a].
(2000) that at limiting [ATP] the probability of detachment of
kinesin motor from MT in kinetic state ‘0’ increases with the
increase in the duration of this state, whereas at high [ATP]
the probability of detachment from kinetic state ‘0’ diminishes.
Our results in Figure 2A and B indicate that the load points that
maximize <t(so)) are close to the crossover load points of P(uo)
and P(wo) at [ATP]: 5 uM and 100 uM. Thus, these results
indicate that at low [ATP] the probability of detachment from
kinetic state ‘0’ is the highest when the probabilities of ATP and
ADP binding to the motor are close. Figure 2C also shows that
at high [ATP], the ATP binding rate rises, which leads to a re-
duction in the duration of kinetic state ‘0’ and an increase in the
durations of kinetic states ‘2’ and ‘3’. This agrees with the find-
ings of Schnitzer et a]. (2000) that at high [ATP] the probability
of detachment from kinetic state ‘0’ diminishes. Accordingly, our
results suggest states ‘2’ and ‘3’ as the most probable kinetic
states for the detachment of kinesin motor from MT at high
[ATP] and low loads, in agreement with the reported kinetic
states for the detachment of kinesin from MT (Hackney, 2002;
Schliwa, 2003; Seitz and Surrey, 2006; Yajima et al., 2002). The
detachment of kinesin motor from MT under high backward

Fig. 2. The mean waiting time over the four kinetic states, (t(s,-)) where
i: 0, 1, 2, 3, versus load at different [ATP]

loads has been observed more commonly at loads >10 pN,
Fdemch> 10 pN (Carter and Cross, 2005). Therefore, our results
in Figure 2A7C show that at high backward loads >10 pN and
all [ATP] the mean waiting time in kinetic states ‘2’ and ‘3’ is
greater than that of other kinetic states. These results suggest
states ‘2’ and ‘3’ as the first and second most probable kinetic
states for the detachment of kinesin motor from MT at loads >10
pN, in agreement with the reported kinetic states for the detach-
ment of kinesin from MT (Schliwa, 2003; Seitz and Surrey,
2006).

To explain the higher durations of kinetic states ‘2’ and ‘3’, we
analyze their respective forward and backward kinetic
transitions. As we discussed in analyzing the probabilities of
[ATP]-independent kinetic transitions, with increasing load from

high forward to backward: (i) forward 11(2):) and it?) rates fall

equally and (ii) backward wan rises with a rate much smaller

(1")

than w3 [see Equations (1) and (2)]. Thus, according to

Equation (7), the slow rise of ATP synthesis rate, i.e. wan, is

the reason that <t(sz)) attains its maximum at higher loads and
at a time that is higher than that of <l(S3)). Figure 2A7C indicates
F: 10.946 pN as the load point that the mean waiting time in
kinetic state ‘2’ is the highest, <t(sz)) : 0.0046s for all [ATP], due

to the slow rise of wan. This implies that at high backward loads
F > Fm” the rate limiting factor of kinesin’s backward stepping is
ATP synthesis, war).

To compare the duration of kinetic state ‘2’ with that of other
kinetic states at load F: 10.946 pN, we compute the ratio of
<t(sz)):0.0046s to <t(s,-)) using Equation (7), where i :0, 1, 3
(see Table 2). Table 2 shows that the duration of kinetic state
‘2’ is at least 63 times greater than that of kinetic state ‘0’ at load
F: 10.946 pN and [ATP]:5uM. With increasing [ATP], the
duration of kinetic state ‘0’ decreases, which leads to a rise in
the ratio of <t(sz)) to <t(s0)). As the forward and backward kinetic
transitions of states ‘1’ and ‘3’ are [ATP]-independent, the ratio
of the duration of kinetic state ‘2’ to those of kinetic states ‘1’ and
‘3’ at load F: 10.946 pN are constant, at 5.067 and 4.200, re-
spectively (see Table 2). Hence, in accordance with the observa-
tions of Schnitzer et a]. (2000), our results in Table 2 suggest
F: 10.946 pN as the load point where the probability of detach-
ment of kinesin motor from MT in kinetic state ‘2’ is the highest.
This is consistent with the common detachment load dech> 10
pN observed by Carter and Cross (2005). As we showed that at
loads lel<F§ Fdemch the long mean waiting time in kinetic
state ‘2’ is due to the low transition rate wan, this low rate of
ATP synthesis can be proposed as a reason for the detachment
of kinesin motor from MT in kinetic state ‘2’. Furthermore,
Figure 2A7C shows that at loads F > 10.946 pN the mean wait-
ing time in state ‘2’ decreases because of the fast rise of ATP
synthesis rate, wan. Thus, based on these results, it can be
deduced that with an increase in the rate of ATP synthesis at
high backward loads F >Fm”, the long duration of being in
kinetic state ‘2’ would decrease, which leads to the reduction of
the detachment probability of kinesin motor from MT. The rise
of ATP synthesis rate may lead to increase in the velocity of
backward stepping of kinesin motor under high backward
loads. These results and the results obtained by separately exam-
ining the probabilities of [ATP]-independent kinetic transitions
(see Fig. 1D-F) conclude that the backward stepping of kinesin
motor is related to both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. The dur-
ation of state ‘2’ decreases to almost 0 at loads F3 32 pN as in

Obviously, the duration of kinetic states in the forward and
backward stepping processes of kinesin motor should agree with
the stationary distribution of probability in these states.
According to Equation (8), to compute the stationary distribu-
tion of probability over kinetic states, it is required to obtain the
directional diagrams of the states. We derive the directional dia-
grams of four kinetic states using the definition of directional
diagram given in the previous Section (see Fig. 3).

For example, Figure 3A shows four directional diagrams of
kinetic state ‘0’, which result in four products and their sum as
follows:

E = {W3W2W1,u1u2u3,u2u3W1,u3W2W1} (11)
0

Z =(W3W2W1+ u1u2u3 + u2u3W1+ M3W2W1) (12)

Similarly, n,- and 2,, Where i: 1, 2, 3, are obtained from
Figure 3BrD, respectively. 2,0,“, is the sum of all 16 products
obtained from four states:

Therefore, we deﬁne the distribution of probability over kin-
etic states s,- (i=0, 1, 2, 3) as follows:

where u,- and w,- (i : 0, 1, 2, 3) are computed by Equations (1) and
(2). Using Equations (14%(17), the distribution of probability
over the four kinetic states is plotted in Figure 4 and shows a
similar pattern to the mean waiting time over these states in
Figure 2. As it can be seen from Figure 4A, at low [ATP] and
low loads the distribution of probability in kinetic state ‘0’ is the
highest. This is consistent with the obtained results of the mean
waiting time over kinetic state ‘0’ and conﬁrms that at limiting
[ATP] kinesin mainly stays in kinetic state ‘0’ and waits for ATP
binding (Clancy et al., 2011; Hackney, 1994). Figure 4A and B
shows that the distribution of probability in kinetic state ‘0’
peaks at maximum points of 0.93 and 0.43 at loads F: 1.987
pN and F: 2.754 pN, respectively, coincide with the crossover

load points of P(uo) and P(wo) at [ATP]:5uM and 100 uM.
These results imply that the probability of observing kinesin
motor in kinetic state ‘0’ will be the highest when the probabil-
ities of ATP and ADP binding to the motor are equal, i.e.
P(uo):P(w0). This also conﬁrms our earlier results about the
duration over kinetic state ‘0’. At high [ATP] and low loads,
the plot shows that the distribution of probability in kinetic
states ‘2’ and ‘3’ becomes dominant (see Fig. 4C), in agreement
with the obtained results of the durations of kinetic states ‘2’ and
‘3’ in Figure 2C. It is also seen from Figure 4A7C that at high
backward loads >10 pN and at all [ATP], the distribution of
probability in kinetic states ‘2’ and ‘3’ is greater than that of
other kinetic states. This suggests ‘2’ and ‘3’ as the first and
second most probable kinetic states that kinesin motor stays at
loads >10 pN, in agreement with the obtained results of the
durations of these kinetic states and the reported kinetic states
for the detachment of kinesin from MT (Schliwa, 2003; Seitz and
Surrey, 2006). The high distribution of probability in kinetic state
‘2’ at high loads lel<F 5 dech conﬁrms the long duration of
this state due to the low rate of ATP synthesis.

Fig. 1. The performance of the two DTE analysis methods, SDEAP and DEXUS, on simulated regular RNA-Seq data. Plot (a) compares the AUCpT, PRE and REC scores achieved by the
two methods on simulated RNA-Seq samples of binary conditions, while Plot (b) provides the scores on samples of three or more conditions. The X-axis shows different combinations of

group sizes, where (n1 , n2 ,  indicates the number 111 of replicates in condition 2'. The Y—axis represents the AUC PRE and REC scores averaged over 10 replicates. The error bars

Fig. 2. The performance of SDEAP and DEXUS on simulated SC RNA-Seq data. Plot (a) presents the AUCpT, PRE and REC scores on simulated SC RNA-Seq samples with different

conﬁgurations of group sizes as considered in Fig. 1(a) and l(b). Again, the X-axis shows different combinations of group sizes and the Y-axis illustrates the three scores. Plot (b) shows the

accuracy of estimating the numbers of conditions on simulated SC RNA-Seq data, which is demonstrated in the same way as in Fig. l(c) and l(d).

parameterized by the FPKM values. Finally, paired-end reads are synthe-
sized from the annotated transcripts according the observed numbers. The
details of the three steps are given below.

We describe ﬁrst how the two expression proﬁles for binary conditions
are created. The construction of the proﬁles for three or more conditions
will be introduced later in Section 3.1.3. In the ﬁrst of the two expression
proﬁles, the FPKM value of each transcript is randomly drawn from a log-
normal distribution as done in the literature (Li and Jiang, 2012). Here,
only genes that have multiple transcripts are considered. A transcript is said
to be detectable if its FPKM value is greater than 0.1. A gene with multiple
transcripts is discarded if the sum of the FPKM values of its transcripts is

less than 1.0 or none of its transcripts is detectable according to the ﬁrst
expression proﬁle. Hence, our simulated datasets are comprised of 3089
genes. To create the second expression proﬁle, among the 3089 genes, 308
(N 10%) genes are chosen as DTE genes. All the DTE genes are evenly diVi-
ded into three categories: up-regulated, down-regulated and differentially
spliced. For each up-regulated gene, a detectable transcript is randomly
selected and its abundance is increased by a factor of at least 4, a widely
used threshold to deﬁne differential expression in the literature (Yang et al.,
2013; Bullard et al., 2010). Similarly, for each down-regulated gene, the
abundance of a randomly selected (detectable) transcript is decreased by
a factor of at least 4. For each differentially spliced gene, the maximum

Fig. 3. The clustering results on two real RNA-Seq datasets. Plot (a) and (b) present the dendrograms of the hierarchical clustering by SDEAP and DEXUS on the BC dataset. The Y-axis

is the measurement of similarity between the samples and X-axis are the labels of each sample. The HER2 samples are colored red, the TNBC samples green and the non-TNBC samples

blue. The three red boxes in each dendrogram illustrate three clusters obtained by the corresponding method. Similarly, Plot (c) and (d) demonstrate the hierarchical clustering by SDEAP

and DEXUS on the SC samples of different cell-cycle phases. Every red label is a cell in the G1 cell-cycle phase and every blue label a cell in the G2/M phase. Cells in the S phase are

represented by green labels. The three red boxes in each dendrogram illustrate three clusters. The expression proﬁles obtained from SDEAP and DEXUS on the samples in the SC datasets

are further visualized by the PCA analysis in Plot (e) and (f) respectively. The dots are colored in the same away as in Plot (c) and (d).

and minimum abundance values of its transcripts are swapped. Different
from up- and down-regulated genes, total amount of reads mapped to dif-
ferentially spliced genes may not have signiﬁcant difference between the
samples from the binary conditions. All three types of DTE genes are
included and tested in the following simulation studies. The other 2781
genes are selected as equally expressed (EE) genes and the FPKM values
of their transcripts remain the same in both expression proﬁles.

Given an FPKM value mtyc of transcript t in the expression proﬁle for
a predeﬁned condition 0, the number of observed RNA-Seq reads, 7371-,
from the transcript t in a sample 2' of the condition 0 follows the negative
binomial distribution NB(6',57C,  where 0,576 is the mean value of the
read counts and (Z) is the dispersion rates. The variance of 7"th- modeled by
the distribution is 0,576 + (1)0376 The mean value 0mg 2 mtvc X 1,: X 3:,
Where It is the length of t in kilo bps and s is the size of the RNA-Seq
library in millions. We simulate RNA-Seq libraries of moderate sizes with
s set to 40M. The dispersion rate (1) is set to be 0.179 as done in the lite-
rature (Kimes et al., 2014). In real RNA-Seq data, the observed variance
of the read counts is signiﬁcantly greater than the sample variance mode-
led by the distribution (Oberg et al., 2012) due to outliers. Two studies
based on real RNA-Seq data show that approximately 5% genes from the
same biological condition have signiﬁcantly higher variance in transcript
expression than expected due to outliers (Oberg et al., 2012; Gierlinski
et al., 2015). To simulate datasets that reﬂect real RNA-Seq data as much
as possible, 5% genes are selected as genes that contain outliers in the
simulated samples. Extreme high values of transcript expression are usu-
ally detected in approximately 10% of real RNA-Seq samples (Gierlinski
et al., 2015). To simulate such extreme high expression values, we allow
the randomly drawn read counts rm- for transcript t from the selected
outlier genes to have a 10% probability of being ampliﬁed from 5 to 10

times in sample 2' as done in (Zhou etal., 2014). In addition to the existence
of extremely highly expressed transcripts, a study shows that the exons of
lowly expressed transcripts could be ubiquitously missing in every one of
two technical or biological replicates (McIntyre et al., 2011). To account
for such missing-value events, among the 5% selected outlier genes, we
allow the randomly drawn read count rm- for a transcript t with abundance
lower than 1.0 to have a 30% to 50% probability of being assigned zero in
sample 2'.

Given the randomly drawn read counts 7371-, TM- paired-end RNA-Seq
reads of 50 bps each are obtained from both ends of rt 72- / 2 cDNA fragments
synthesized from the genomic region of the transcript t in the hg38 refere-
nce genome. The density distribution of the synthesized cDNA fragments
along the genomic region of the transcript t follows a positional proﬁle that
reﬂects positional biases due to complementary DNA fragmentation (Li
and Jiang, 2012). To avoid biased assessment of prediction accuracy due
to random sampling, the simulation experiment on each conﬁguration is
repeated 10 times and the average performance of each method is reported
in the following discussion.

3.1.2 Performance on RNA-Seq Data from Two Conditions

Both SDEAP and DEXUS are tested on several simulated datasets with
binary conditions. The combinations of group sizes, ml and ng, in the
simulated datasets are from the literature (Kimes et al., 2014; Klambauer
et al., 2013). If n1 > mg, the n1 RNA-Seq samples are called the major
group and the rig samples are called the minor group. The performance
results of both methods on all group size conﬁgurations are summarized
in Fig. 1(c). The accuracy in estimating the number of conditions, as
demonstrated in Fig. 1(b), is measured by the proportion of genes that
have at least one expression feature resulting in correctly estimated number

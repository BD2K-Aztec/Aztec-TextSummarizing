Abstract

Motivation: Single—molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) microscopy provides images of
cellular structure at a resolution an order of magnitude below what can be achieved by conven—
tional diffraction limited techniques. The concomitantly larger data sets generated by SMLM
require increasingly efficient image analysis software. Density based clustering algorithms, with
the most ubiquitous being DBSCAN, are commonly used to quantitatively assess sub—cellular
assemblies. DBSCAN, however, is slow, scaling with the number of localizations like O(n log (n)) at
best, and it’s performance is highly dependent upon a subjectively selected choice of parameters.
Results: We have developed a grid—based clustering algorithm FOCAL, which explicitly accounts
for several dominant artifacts arising in SMLM image reconstructions. FOCAL is fast and efficient,
scaling like O(n), and only has one set parameter. We assess DBSCAN and FOCAL on experimental
dSTORM data of clusters of eukaryotic RNAP II and PALM data of the bacterial protein H—NS, then
provide a detailed comparison via simulation. FOCAL performs comparable and often superior to
DBSCAN while yielding a significantly faster analysis. Additionally, FOCAL provides a novel
method for filtering out of focus clusters from complex SMLM images.

With the advent of super—resolved microscopy, images of cellular
structure and organization can be acquired with visible light at a
spatial resolution well surpassing the diffraction limit. A popular
family of techniques, referred to as single—molecule localization mi—
croscopy (SMLM), can achieve a lateral resolution down to a few
tens of nanometers, with only slightly worse axial resolution.
SMLM works by driving a dense population of ﬂuorescent mol—
ecules through multiple cycles of photoactivation, photoswitching
or blinking and bleaching. Under appropriate conditions, it’s pos—
sible to temporally isolate the ﬂuorescence of a single—molecule,

limited volume. The precise location of each isolated molecule is
determined, limited primarily by the number of emitted photons,
and the process is repeated tens of thousands of times to generate a
reconstructed image from the assembled localizations. Examples
of SMLM techniques are stochastic optical reconstruction
microscopy (STORM) (Rust et (11., 2006), direct STORM
(dSTORM) (Heilemann et (11., 2008), photo—activated localization
microscopy (PALM) (Betzig et (11., 2006), bleaching/blinking—
assisted localization microscopy (BaLM) (Burnette et (11., 2011),
and so on.

SMLM is increasingly being employed in cells to image and
quantitatively analyze various protein complexes forming tens of
nm to hundreds of nm assemblies, from membrane receptors to nu—
cleosome bundles (Bar—On et (11., 2012; Dudok et (11., 2014;
Endesfelder et (11., 2013; Itano et (11., 2014; Pertsinidis et (11., 2013;
Ricci et (11., 2015). However, because of the techniques inherent sin—
gle—molecule sensitivity, SMLM is prone to a host of artifacts that
have little effect on conventional diffraction limited modalities. For
membrane proteins or other targets close to the cell surface, illumin—
ation via Total Internal Reﬂection Fluorescence (TIRF) can consid—
erably improve the image quality. Unfortunately, it can be much
more difficult to employ SMLM to image intranuclear structures,
for example, which may reside deep within the cell. For abundant
proteins or extended structures that fill large portions of the cellular
volume, alternatives to wide—field illumination, such as HILO (or
dirty—TIRF) (Tokunaga et (11., 2008) can provide course optical sec—
tioning. Of course, for even more crowded regions, it may be neces—
sary to resort to complicated light—sheet illumination schemes (Cella
Zanacchi et (11., 2011; Gebhardt et (11., 2013; Hu et (11., 2013).

Consider the imaging artifacts that arise when using immuno—
ﬂuorescence labeling to target specific molecules within a fixed cell
(Haas et (11., 2014). Nonspecific interactions of the tagged antibodies
with either the growth substrate or cell generate false localizations
that add noise to the reconstructed image (Burnette et (11., 2011). A
static ﬂuorescence background can reduce the precision with which
individual target ﬂuorophores can be localized. And blurred, out of
focus, blinking ﬂourophores not only increase the local background,
but if located close to the focal plane, can be imprecisely localized.

There are a number of approaches to characterizing the spatial
organization and nanoscale morphology of protein assemblies
imaged with SMLM. On the one hand, there are ensemble methods
that provide spatial statistics, such as pair—correlation analysis
(Sengupta et (11., 2013) or Ripley’s L—function (Endesfelder et (11.,
2014). On the other are methods that directly group localizations
into discrete clusters. For SMLM, density based spatial clustering of
applications with noise (DBSCAN) is the most commonly employed
method of this type (Bar—On et (11., 2012; Endesfelder et (11., 2013;
Pertsinidis et (11., 2013). Significant analysis can follow cluster iden—
tification, such as determining the cluster size/radius or the number
of proteins within each cluster (Cattoni et (11., 2013; Deschout et (11.,
2014; Ghamari et (11., 2013).

The ability of DBSCAN to identify and reject ‘noise’ is advanta—
geous, which to a large extent accounts for its popularity. However,
in addition to the complications of background noise, artifacts appear
in SMLM images because the localization density is a function of
both the number of tagged proteins in an assembly and the photophy—
sics of the ﬂuorescent labels. Since most ﬂuorophores blink multiple
times, and there is some error involved in the localization of each
blink, a single ﬂuorescent label will result in a cluster of localizations.
Likewise, because the duration of each blink is stochastic, blinks that
last for multiple frames will also generate a cluster. Therefore, a single
density threshold, as in DBSCAN, may not be sufficient to differenti—
ate between clusters of localizations due to protein assemblies and
artifactual pseudo—clusters arising, for instance, from a ﬂuorescently
labeled, solitary protein. This is a concern for all SMLM methods,
since even with ﬂuorophores referred to as irreversibly photo—
activatable, photoblinking is commonly observed (Annibale et (11.,
2010; Nan et (11., 2013). Unfortunately, some clusters may also appear
as ‘noise’ due to limitations in the image reconstruction. For instance,
because of the inherently low photo—activation efficiency of the ﬂuo—
rophores, multiple clustered proteins will occasionally produce only a
single blink during the acquisition period.

Moreover, in the presence of significant noise and off— target 10—
calizations (i.e. localizations not arising from in focus (target) clus—
ters), the performance of DBSCAN critically depends on a pair of
set parameters that specify a density threshold (Gebhardt et (11.,
2013) (i.e. the number of points, minPts, within a search radius a). A
significant drawback to DBSCAN is that the appropriate choice for
these parameters is often ambiguous. In practice, clustering results
for various sets of DBSCAN parameters are typically generated and
the optimum choice is iteratively chosen from an inspection of the
results. Beyond the obvious subjectivity of a visual inspection, this
procedure may not be practical for localization microscopy when
dealing with large data sets of hundreds of thousand to millions of
localizations.

To identify neighboring points, DBSCAN calculates all pairwise
distances within an image, so the runtime scales with the number of
points 71 as O(nz). For a large SMLM data set, this analysis can take
several hours. Region queries such as grid—based spatial indexing
and tree data structures have been implemented to restrict the search
for neighboring localizations to obtain an average time complexity
of O(n log(n)) (Klopotek et al., 2006). Despite this improvement, in
order to find the algorithm’s optimum parameters, DBSCAN should
be executed multiple times. In fact, the parameters might vary from
image to image due to unavoidable variations in sample preparation
such as labeling specificity and heterogeneity of cells. An optimal
clustering analysis with DBSCAN, therefore, can be extremely time
consuming.

Here we present a rapid clustering algorithm customized for
SMLM: Fast Optimized Cluster Algorithm for Localizations
(FOCAL). FOCAL is similar in many respects to a gridded version
of DBSCAN, and like grid—based versions of DBSCAN, at worst
scales like O(n) (Darong and Peng, 2012). But while DBSCAN is an
extremely general clustering algorithm, FOCAL incorporates know—
ledge of artifacts within SMLM images to optimize the analysis.
Moreover, we present a well defined method for quickly selecting
FOCAL’S optimum parameters, which minimizes clustering errors
from SMLM image artifacts. In both simulations and experiments
on immunoﬂuorescently labeled clusters of RNAPII via dSTORM
and ﬂuorescent protein tagged clusters of the histone—like nucleo—
somal protein (H—NS) by PALM, we compared the performance of
FOCAL and DBSCAN in detecting spatial clusters and in dealing
with and filtering out image noise and off—target localizations. Our
results suggest that FOCAL performs comparable and often superior
to DBSCAN while providing a significantly faster analysis of com—
plex SMLM images. In addition, FOCAL provides a novel method
for filtering out of focus clusters from complex SMLM images.

2 Methods

Density based clustering techniques find immediate application in
analyzing SMLM images due to their ability to identify clusters of
arbitrary shapes in the presence of significant off—target signal.
DBSCAN is the most popularly employed member of these tech—
niques and is the foundation for many more elaborate clustering
methods. We begin by providing a brief overview of DBSCAN, enu—
merate its limitations, and then move on to a discussion of our rapid
clustering method FOCAL.

2.1 Density—based clustering with DBSCAN

In brief, DBSCAN first determines the density of data points in the
neighborhood (radius a) of each point, then exploits a density
threshold (minPts) to assign a classification as core, border or

9103 ‘Og JSanV uo salaﬁuv soc] ‘BtHJOJtIBQ JO AJtsraAtuf] 112 /3.10'spzu.m0[p10}x0"sotJBurJOJutotq/ﬁduq 11101} pQPBOIII/lAOG

off—target points. Core points have at least minPts neighbors, border
points are not core points but contain a core point in their neighbor—
hood, and all other points are classified as off—target. Consequently,
neighboring core and border points will be grouped into clusters
(Ester et (11., 1996).

A quantitative analysis of SMLM data is plagued by DBSCAN’s
sensitivity to the choice of input parameters, which, in practice, are
set either by imprecise heuristics or empirically (Klopotek et al.,
2006). Note, by empirically we mean that the parameters are chosen
so the resulting clustering appears more accurate upon visual inspec—
tion, an analysis that is both highly subjective and time consuming
since it requires an iterative analysis. Nonetheless, an empirical
evaluation is the common approach since the heuristically deter—
mined parameters tend to perform poorly. For instance, the original
DBSCAN article suggests setting minPts:D+1, where D is the
dimensionality of the system. In two—dimensional SMLM applica—
tions, minPts is frequently set to values ranging from 3—10 (Dudok
et (11., 2014; Itano et (11., 2014; Endesfelder et (11., 2013; Pertsinidis
et (11., 2013), although larger values (e.g. 16 (Bar—On et (11., 2012))
are sometimes chosen. Likewise, it is often remarked in the literature
that the optimum radius a can be obtained from a knee, or inﬂection
point, in the k—distance plot, which is a plot of the sorted jth neigh—
bor distances ([21,2,3 . . .) of all data points. Unfortunately, not
only does a depend upon the choice of j, which is again arbitrary,
but soft—knees often arise in k—distance plots that hardly narrow
down the optimum value of a. In fact, as depicted in Figure 1, for
SMLM data we obtained of the RNAPII distribution in the nucleus
of a mouse cortex cell, the knee spans a wide range of a (visually, be—
tween 20 and 40 nm).

Overestimating 8 and/or underestimating minPts results in more
false clusters and the incorporation of more off—target outliers into
the clusters. Not surprisingly, the cluster assignment was found to
be significantly inaccurate when analyzing SMLM images in cells
and was addressed by a hybrid simulation assisted DBSCAN (SAD)
method (Nan et (11., 2013). However, SAD only evaluates the statis—
tics of false clusters arising from a random background of localiza—
tions, but does not necessarily account for artifacts from out of
focus features and photoblinking. Moreover, since the algorithm
must be executed multiple times to obtain an optimum parameter—
ization, the computational cost could pose a significant obstacle
when facing large data sets containing millions of localizations.

bution in a mouse cortex cell. The optimum s is commonly estimated from
the jth-neighbor curves 3—10. Localizations within clusters contribute to the
left portion of the curve, while low-density localizations gives rise to the sharp
upturn at the far right. The value at the knee between these two regions was
originally suggested as an optimized s for DBSCAN, which is clearly ambigu-
ous in this example

2.2 Fast optimized cluster algorithm for localizations
(FOCAL)

The ambiguity inherent in choosing DBSCAN’s parameters as well
as its high computational overhead is largely due to the algorithms
generality. In order to address these limitations, we developed a Fast
Optimized Cluster Algorithm for Localizations (FOCAL), specific—
ally designed for single—molecule localization microscopy. FOCAL is
a grid—based method with linear time complexity (C(71)). This makes
it possible to rapidly optimize the algorithm’s parameters and ana—
lyze data. Moreover, FOCAL only has a single parameter that needs
to be optimized: a density threshold (minL). Details of the algorithm
are depicted in Figure 2.

SMLM images are built from a localization table, which is a list
of the approximate spatial coordinates of ﬂuorescent labels within
the sample. We first discretize the localization table by assigning
each localization event to a gridded bin (Fig. 2A). A single label pro—
duces a spread of localizations, which gives rise to the localization
uncertainty (6), and can be easily estimated for each experiment
from a temporal, adjacent—neighbor analysis (Endesfelder et (11.,
2014). The localization uncertainty 6, therefore, provides a natural
scale for the grid spacing. In fact, a bin—size smaller than the local—
ization uncertainty costs more memory without containing add—
itional structural information. For very bright organic dyes such as
Alexa—647, a localization uncertainty of ~10 nm is achievable
(Betzig et (11., 2006; Rust et (11., 2006).

At this stage, contrast between the cluster regions and the back—
ground is very low and a simple thresholding cannot efficiently dis—
tinguish the two regions. A larger grid would improve the contrast
at the expense of losing fine structural information. To increase the
contrast several—fold, without changing the grid spacing (i.e. the

constructed by replacement of each bin value with the sum of the 3 x 3 array
centered at that bin (B). Bins at the edge of the image (grey shaded) are dis-
carded from the analysis. A density threshold (minL), set to 9 in this example,
specifies core (bolded) and border (regular) points (C). Only clusters of min-
imum size 3 x 3 plus 1 are retained to filter single point sources (D). The iden-
tified cluster is shown with red/checkered (green/striped) bins representing

resolution), a density map is constructed from the binned localiza—
tions by substituting each non—zero assignment in the grid with the
sum of the 3 X 3 array centered at that same bin (Fig. 2B). The re—
sulting density map can now be thresholded and those bins of value
greater than minL are identified as core points. Of the remaining
bins, those that do not satisfy this criterion, but are a 4—connected
neighbor to a core point, are considered as border points and
included in the cluster candidate map (Fig. 2C). Four—connected
core and border points will be regarded as cluster candidates.
Individual, blinking or relatively photostable ﬂuorophores would
generate many localizations, and would not be removed by the pre—
vious threshold. Repeated localizations from such a ﬂuorophore will
contribute to bins within a 3 X 3 array centered at its position.
Therefore, to reject these pseudo—clusters, only clusters that have a
minimum cluster size of 3 X 3 plus 1 bins are qualified as a protein
cluster (Fig. 2D).

The only parameter that needs to be optimized in FOCAL is the
density threshold minL. This optimization is achieved by filtering
out low density, out of focus clusters. To understand how this
works, consider a single, blinking ﬂuorophore that is localized mul—
tiple times. The density of localizations will reduce considerably if
the ﬂuorphore is defocused. Even a few hundred nm defocusing in—
creases the area of the point spread function by a factor of between
2—10 (DeSantis et (11., 2012). The localization uncertainty (oxw) for
each blink ranges over a distribution of values (Fig. 3A shows an ex—
ample distribution for different photon thresholds). While the mean
and the spread of the distribution decrease for increasing photon
number, because this is a statistical property, a filter on intensity
and localization uncertainty is not a perfect discriminator of accept—
able localizations (Fig. 3B). When reconstructing an out of focus
cluster, many of the localizations originating from the cluster will be
rejected either because they emit below the photon threshold or be—
cause the width of the localization is too wide. However, statistically,
some of the localizations will pass through this filter despite being out
of focus, resulting in clusters that are more dilute than those detected
in focus. By tuning the density threshold minL, we are able to filter
out the lower density clusters, which should result in an overall in—
crease in the localization uncertainty of the acquired image.

With this discussion in mind, our strategy for optimizing the
density threshold minL can be depicted as in Figure 4. FOCAL is
used to cluster the SMLM data with a low—initial value for minL. All
localizations from pixels with densities above or below minL are dis—
regarded. The localization uncertainty is then directly calculated
from the filtered data by a temporal adjacent neighbor analysis, as

discussed earlier, and the process is repeated at increasing values of
minL. Figure 4 shows a monotonic decrease in the localization un—
certainty as minL increases. As expected, increasing minL filters out
clusters with a lower density of localizations, significantly reducing
the overall localization uncertainty of the remaining clustered popu—
lation. However, setting too high a density threshold will needlessly
reject clusters without significant gains in localization uncertainty.
A plot of the localization uncertainty versus minL, as in Figure 4,
serves as a useful guide for choosing the density threshold minL.
While there remains some ﬂexibility, a reasonable and easily auto—
mated way to identify an optimum density threshold, minL"', is to
select the point at which the localization uncertainty is one standard
deviation away from the asymptote of an exponential fit to the curve
in Figure 4 (minL" ~ 14 in this example). Note that unlike the in—
ﬂection point in the k—distance plots for DBSCAN, this procedure
yields a value for minL that is well constrained and can be rapidly
calculated.

3 Results

3.1 dSTORM microscopy of transcription factories
Transcription factories (TFs) are small (45—100nm) assemblies of ac—
tive RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) holoenzymes that form discrete
clusters in the eukaryotic cell nucleus (Sutherland and Bickmore,
2009). The number of TFs is estimated from a few hundred to several
thousand, dependent on the cell, although these numbers are still a
matter of significant debate. Recently, we analyzed the clustering of
Alexa—647 immunolabeled RNAP II within the nucleus of several cell
types via dSTORM (Davidson et al., in process). These images,
acquired deep within the cell, suffer from nonspecific labeling and
abundant out of focus ﬂuorescence. A typical SMLM reconstruction
is provided in Figure 5A, which is of the RNAP H distribution within
a mouse cortex cell (see Supplementary information).

If we heuristically set the parameters in DBSCAN as described in
Section 2.1, (i.e. a: 30 is approximated from the k—distance graph
of Figure 1 and minPts:2 + 1), the algorithm identifies almost all
localizations as members of 1924 (pseudo—) clusters (Fig. 5B).
However, a visual inspection shows that FOCAL better rejects arti—
facts in the image to identify only 377 clusters with an average

diameter of 47 i 30 nm (Fig. 5E). For this image, minL was set to 14
from an analysis of the localization uncertainty, which was in the
range of ~8—10 nm (we set 6 : 10 nm) (see Fig. 4).

Because FOCAL is similar to a grid—based version of DBSCAN,
we can use the optimized FOCAL parameters to estimate a compar—
able set of parameters for DBSCAN. The area of the 3 X 3 arrays
used to construct a density map in FOCAL can roughly be equated
to the circular neighborhood in DBSCAN (i.e. a : 36/111/2).
Similarly, both minL in FOCAL and minPts in DBSCAN set a dens—
ity threshold. Because DBSCAN excludes each target point under
consideration, we set minPtszminLTI. From these considerations,
we adjusted DBSCAN’s parameters when analyzing this image to
a: 17 and minPts: 13. DBSCAN now effectively rejects artifacts
and considerably reduces the number of detected clusters to 718
(Fig. 5D). This is still ~90% percent more clusters than were de—
tected by FOCAL (these results are summarized in Table 1). Upon
closer inspection (see Supplementary Fig. S5), almost all the add—
itional clusters detected by DBSCAN were smaller than the 10 pixel
grid minimum imposed in FOCAL, so most likely arise from single
labels. Alternatively, these small foci could be tightly condensed
clusters, but at this scale a spatial analysis is limited by the reso—
lution of the microscopy.

3.2 PALM imaging of H—NS proteins

To further test the clustering capabilities of FOCAL, we analyzed
PALM images of the histone—like nucleosomal (H—NS) protein, fused
to the fluorescent protein mEOS3.2, in fixed E. coli. H—NS acts as
both a global regulator of gene expression and DNA condensation
in enterobacteria. Experiments suggest that H—NS can repeatedly di—
merize to form extended filaments, which may additionally con—
dense DNA through bridging of adjacent strands (Ali et (11., 2012;
Dame, 2005).

Because bacteria have a spatial depth of approximately N1 pm,
the cells could be imaged by wide—field epifluorescence, and display
significantly less background than we encountered imaging RNAPII
within the nucleus of a cortex cell. Moreover, since we are imaging
fluorescent proteins, the reconstructions do not suffer from non—
specific labeling artifacts that immunolabeling is prone to.

H—NS should be found within the cell as both a monomeric unit
and in clusters of varying sizes, all of which should generate localiza—
tions above or below the focal plane. Figure 6B shows that a heuris—
tic choice for DBSCAN’s parameters (a : 30, minPts :2 + 1)
accepts virtually every localization as a member of a cluster, so the
raw localization image pretty much corresponds to the DBSCAN”r
filtered image. The parametrically optimized DBSCAN (a : 17,
minPts: 14) significantly filters low density localizations as does
FOCAL (minL’r : 15, see Supplementary Fig. S3) implying that
most of the clusters are either out of focus and/or originate from
monomers of H—NS. Again, a comparison between Figure 6C and D
shows that both DBSCAN and FOCAL agree on a significant frac—
tion of the detected clusters. FOCAL, however, filters out a number
of smaller clusters that DBSCAN accepts since these clusters cannot
be distinguished from multiple localizations of a single fluorophore
(these results are summarized in Table 1).

3.3 Simulations
We next performed a series of simulations to compare DBSCAN
and FOCAL in regards to suppression of off—target localizations
(from noise and unclustered, single—fluorophores), cluster identifica—
tion and the preservation of cluster characteristics. The parameters
for these algorithms have been optimized based upon the dSTORM
images in the previous section, which we take as representative ex—
amples of SMLM data.

We begin with an assessment of false clustering by generating
random sets of localizations at increasing densities, within a 10 um
square region, and applying both clustering algorithms (Fig. 7).

Noise Density (um'z) X10

Fig. 7. Density of false clustering as a function of noise density for complete
random noise. (Filled Circles) DBSCAN*: optimized via heuristics (2:30nm,
minPts:3). (Filled Squares) DBSCAN: empirically optimized to minimize
noise (a: 17 nm, minPts:11). (Open Squares) FOCAL: (minL: 12)

Assuming that the off—target localizations we observe in our
dSTORM experiments are completely random, we can estimate an
empirical density of ~0.2 X 103 localizations per umz. The imaging
attained a localization precision of ~10 nm, and the optimum minL
fell in the range of 12—1 8. In the following, since we must pick a par—
ameter set to analyze, we have arbitrarily set 6 : 10 nm and
minL: 12, but this choice should not affect our qualitative results.
On average, this density gives rise to N2 false clusters per um2 using
DBSCAN, with the parameters heuristically set as before (a : 30 and
minPts:3). Mapping FOCAL’s parameters onto DBSCAN, as in
the previous section, results in minPts : 1 1 and s : 17. These param—
eters eliminate much of the false clustering, but the gains rapidly dis—
appear as the off—target density is increased. In what follows, we’ll
employ this optimized set of parameters for DBSCAN.

Now consider the performance of FOCAL on the same simulated
random data. Figure 7 shows that FOCAL performs on par with
DBSCAN; both are able to reject false clusters up to a density of
approximately 4 X 103 localizations per umz. At higher densities,
however, both algorithms become unreliable. In practice, since the
off—target localizations are not truly randomly distributed, local
density ﬂuctuations could lead to significantly more false clustering
(Nan et (11., 2013).

We next introduce a set number of circular clusters among a ran—
dom background to assess how well the algorithms perform at deter—
mining the number and size of the clusters (see Fig. 8). 200 clusters,
each composed of 64 localizations scattered over a disk 50 nm in
diameter, were distributed in a 10 um square region (see
Supplementary Fig. S7 for a schematic). Again, these numbers were
chosen to resemble common experimental conditions. In order to
introduce blinking while maintaining a set number of localizations
in each cluster, we assumed that each cluster results from 16 uni—
formly scattered labels and that each label blinks 4 times. The num—
ber of blinks was estimated from the ratio of the acquisition time
and the ﬂuorophore off—time, the latter of which is calculated from
the ratio of the average blink on—time (2.3 frames) and the duty cycle
(~5 X 1074) in our dSTORM measurements (Dempsey et (11., 2011).

The position of each localization was found from a normal prob—
ability density centered at each label with a standard deviation equal
to the localization uncertainty (6 : 10 nm). At this localization dens—
ity, both algorithms accurately detect all clusters at low off—target
densities. However, as expected from our results in Figure 7,

Noise Density (pm'z) X10

Fig. 8. The detected density of clusters versus noise density (A) and the nor-
malized average cluster radius versus noise density (B). The inset in (B)
shows the coefficient of variation of the cluster radii versus noise density

FOCAL and DBSCAN are able to discern the actual clusters from
the random background up to densities of ~4 X 103 localizations
per um2 (Fig. 8A).

At low to moderate off—target densities, where both algorithms
accurately identify the clusters, DBSCAN tends to overestimate the
size of the clusters in comparison to FOCAL (Fig. 8B). The size of
each cluster is characterized by a radius R : Wit, where A is the
area of the cluster. For FOCAL, this is simply the area of all grid
pixels associated with a given cluster, while for DBSCAN, the area
is taken as the convex hull of all localizations within a cluster. In
this simulation, at a density of 1 X 103 localizations per umz, which
is what we observed in our dSTORM experiments, the predicted
average cluster size is inﬂated by 11 % in DBSCAN compared to less
than 4% in FOCAL. Moreover, the insert of Figure 8B indicates that
FOCAL typically detects a more uniform spread of cluster sizes,
closer to the simulated population, than DBSCAN. This can be seen
in the coefficient of variation CV : (SR/(R), where GR is the stand—
ard deviation in cluster radii and (R) is the average detected radius
As the off—target density increases further, both algorithms progres—
sively incorporate off—target localizations into the clusters. This ini—
tially results in an inﬂation of the average detected cluster size, but
eventually both algorithms start identifying numerous, small
pseudo—clusters swinging the average cluster size back down.

Finally, we investigated the performance of both techniques in
preserving cluster characteristics in the absence of off—target local—
izations. Toward this end, we simulated ring shaped clusters of dif—
ferent labeling densities, with inner radii of 60 nm and outer radii
varying from 60 to 90 nm (see Supplementary Fig. S8 for a sche—
matic). Labels were distributed uniformly over the rings and, as

Localization Density mm?!)

Fig. 9. Performance of FOCAL and DBSCAN in clustering of ring shaped clus-
ters with various thicknesses as indicated (in nm). The figure plots the mean
number of clusters detected in each ring shaped cluster as a function of the
localization density (Color version of this figure is available at Bioinformatics
online.)

before, each label gave rise to 4 localizations (blinks) drawn from a
normal probability density. At each density, this process was re—
peated multiple times to obtain the average number of detected clus—
ters. When the localization density (i.e. the number of localizations
per unit area) was very low, both techniques failed to detect the clus—
ters while at high enough densities, the full ring clusters could be
identified (Fig. 9). However, at intermediate densities, the rings be—
come segmented. Because DBSCAN clusters are not restricted in
their size, DBSCAN tended to detect many more component clusters
within each ring as compared to FOCAL (Fig. 9). On the other
hand, at intermediate densities (i.e. 2—2.5 nm’2 for 30 nm thick
rings), FOCAL was slightly better at merging the components into a
single, larger cluster (Supplementary Fig. S8). Therefore, at inter—
mediate localization densities, FOCAL again seems to preserve the
cluster shape better that DBSCAN.

4 Conclusion

Various clustering methods are used to characterize the organiza—
tion of nanoscale assemblies in localization microscopy images.
Unlike statistical approaches, such as Ripley’s L—function and pair—
correlation analysis that estimate ensemble parameters
(Endesfelder et al., 2013), DBSCAN and other derivative density—
based clustering algorithms are able to identify and quantify
individual clusters. However, DBSCAN is slow, scaling with the
number of particles like O(n log (n)) at best; is acutely sensitive to
the algorithm’s parameters, which are typically selected by visual
inspection of the output; and is prone to detecting a large number
of false clusters in the presence of a significant background of lo—
calizations. To address these problems we developed FOCAL, a
rapid O(n), density—based clustering method that is tailored for 10—
calization microscopy.

FOCAL is a rapid and efficient tool for density based clustering
in super—resolution microscopy data. In contrast to DBSCAN,
FOCAL sets a threshold for a minimum cluster size, based upon the
image localization uncertainty, to remove pseudo—clusters arising
from multiple localizations of single ﬂuorophores. Moreover,
FOCAL can be rapidly optimized to minimize false clustering and
remove diffuse, out of focus clusters while maintaining cluster integ—
rity. Alternatively, FOCAL could serve as a method for quickly

determining the optimum density threshold for a DBSCAN based
clustering analysis.

As SMLM becomes more commonplace, increasingly efficient al—
gorithms will need to be developed to deal with the large amounts of
data generated when imaging at such fine resolution. FOCAL can
rapidly analyze large SMLM data sets, performing at least on par
with, if not better than, DBSCAN in most situations.

Its efficiency in analyzing large image data sets should make
FOCAL a suitable replacement to the much slower DBSCAN derived
algorithms, and a solid foundation for further clustering analysis.

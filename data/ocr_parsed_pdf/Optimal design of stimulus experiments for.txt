of a linear OED for best parameter estimation is rather poor for
nonlinear systems having widely distributed parameters.

An experimental design aimed at model discrimination is typ—
ically generated at a point where existing data do not provide
further discriminative information for a pool of competing, vali—
dated and identiﬁable models. With these models, robust experi—
mental designs can be generated, which presumably yield data
with optimal discrimination information. Since predictions with
ODE models depend on the model parameters, identiﬁability is
important as it ensures the existence of a unique solution to the
parameter estimation problem and, consequently, unique model
predictions (Raue et al., 2009). A non—identiﬁable model would
yield non—unique model predictions under altered experimental
design conditions, as there exists a set of several solutions to the
parameter estimation problem. Robustness of the experimental
design is achieved by considering (i) pure uncertainty about the
model itself, (ii) distributed model predictions that arise from
distributed model parameters and (iii) design variabilities (e.g.
variations of the applied stimulus) during the conduction of
the experiment.

In this work, part (ii) of design robustiﬁcation for nonlinear
models is considered, focusing on computational efﬁcient and
accurate estimation of the nonlinear propagated parameter prob—
ability distribution function (PDF) in an optimal control frame—
work. We suggest using the sigma—point method as an alternative
to the classical linearization approach. Therefore, both
approaches are presented, applied and compared in the light of
OESD for robust model discrimination, assuming perfect experi—
mental conduction. In the following section, we describe the es—
sential parts of our design approach, including (i) ODE modeling
of biological reaction networks with and extended interpretation
of distributed determinism, (ii) the model overlap as a PDF—
based discrimination criterion, (iii) linearization and sigma—point
methods and (iv) two numerical approaches to solve optimal
control problems. Then, using two numerical examples, we for—
mulate the optimization problem and benchmark the lineariza—
tion approach against the sigma—point approach (Section 3).

2 METHODS

2.1 Dynamic modeling of biochemical reaction systems

ODEs provide the modeling basis to describe the dynamics of biochem-
ical reaction networks. The dynamics of the internal states
x(t,u(t),0x) e Ax C R"“, e.g. protein concentrations, is determined by
the solution of an initial value problem of the form

d
a W) = f(X0), “(0, 0x) (1)

with initial system states x(t0) = x0 and right-hand side function
f(x(t), u(t), 0X) describing biologic interaction mechanisms, which depends
on the system states x(t), (multiple) inputs u(t) (=stimulus) and kinetic
parameter set 0‘. Assuming f to be Lipschitz in x(t), u(t) and continuous
in t, the readout variables are determined by

ysim(ta 0) = g(X(l, 0x), 0y), (2)

where the function giassumed to be sufﬁciently smoothirelates
the internal system states to the readouts of the experiment with corres-
ponding readout parameters 0y, which together with dynamic parameters
and initial conditions are merged into the model parameter vector
0 = [0X,0y]T, with redeﬁned dynamic parameter vector 0X E [0X,x0]T.

The dynamic model deﬁned by Equations (1) and (2) can be understood
as a time-dependent mapping from the model parameter space
Agx >< Agy 2 Ag C R"" to the model output space Ay C R"~“,

2.2 Distributed determinism

Although biological systems might follow deterministic rules, repeated
measurements, even though with very accurate measurement techniques,
will yield different results. The reasons for that are manyfold.
Additionally to unavoidable measurement errors, biologic variability,
i.e. systems with intrinsically distributed parameters, can induce a large
spread in the transient dynamics and stationary behavior. In the case of
the existence of multiple steady states, this spreading effect might even be
more pronounced. Varying parameters during the measuring procedure
and local parameter perturbations by non-stationary noise also contrib-
ute to a distributed measurement signal (Lorenz et al., 2007). Complex,
nonlinear models of biological systems might also behave chaotic, further
contributing to distributed response measurements. Thus, the conven-
tional sharp, deterministic system representation needs to be extended
by the notion of distributed determinism, i.e. although the system
might completely be deterministic, its perceived signals are distributed
realizations of the underlying deterministic mechanisms. This can be
done by considering the parameters, and hence, the model responses as
random variables 6) and Y, respectively, each characterized by a PDF.
We point out that, within this interpretation, the system and hence the
model is assumed to naturally possess distributed parameters.
Consequently, a distributed response is not solely explained by additive
measurement noise but also by other sources of variations, which may be
represented as distributed parameter sets.

Let the model parameters be distributed according to some well-
deﬁned PDF p(_)(0), with 0 6 Ag being a realization of G). The PDF of
the random model response Y at time t can be derived from the normal-
ized integral over all possible parameter and corresponding response real-
izations, weighted with the parameter PDF, i.e.

Qv(y, I)

An

where 1y[h(t, 0)] represents the indicator function

1, 'f =ht,0
lywn={o :15: < )

(7)

The normalization employs the Ll-norm with respect to y e Ay. Note
that y represents an arbitrary possible realization of Y in Ay, whereas
h(t, 0) describes the model response at time t for a ﬁxed stimulus time
course u(t0 —> t) given parameter realization 0. Consequently, for every
single point in time, the shape of Equation (5) is determined by the par-
ameter PDF, the choice of model [Equations (1) and (2)] and stimulus
time course (=experimental design). Consequently, the discrimination
process can be robustiﬁed by discriminating competing models based
on their model response PDFs [Equation (5)], accounting for variabilities
in the parameters and model-speciﬁc mapping to the response space.

2.3 Robust design criteria for model discrimination

Here, we present the model overlap as a robust discrimination criterion,
measuring dissimilarities of model response PDFs used to rate the dis-
criminative power of a design during optimization. We deﬁne the general

model overlap as the probability product kernel used in vector machine
learning to measure statistical distances for the sake of discriminative
learning (Jebara et al., 2004). Following Jebara et al., (2004), the prob-
ability product kernel of two multivariate PDFs pQ‘A, p93 6 L2(Ay) is
deﬁned as the scalar product

<I>(t, um) = / puny, r, mommy, r, u(t)>"dy (8)
with the densities being raised to some power 17 e R+\{0}. It provides a
bounded, positive-deﬁnite measure (Jebara et al., 2004) of similarity be-
tween distributions on the set Ay, whereas the parameter 17 controls the
weighting of regions with small versus large densities.
From this, the average overlap of the time course is

where D 6 ID = '|]' X [U X Y represents the experimental design within the
feasible design region ID, encompassing for instance selection of discrete
measurement time points IA. 6 "IT, stimulus design u(t) e [U and readout
design g e V. Using the model response PDFs py]m(y, t, u(t)) from
Equation (5) for two competing models, m e {A, B} in Equation (9) pro-
vides us with a measure of average model dissimilarities. For 17: 1, the
overlap is the expected model response probability of model A under
model B and vice versa [Equation (8)]. In this case, assuming one of
the models to be true, the overlap yields the expected likelihood of the
other model depending on the experimental design 1). Consequently, an
optimal model discrimination design 1) minimizes Equation (9).
Singh (1998) proposed to use Equation (8) with p=1/2iknown as
Bhattacharyya’s afﬁnity between distributionsifor discriminating non-
linear regression models. It is closely related to Hellinger’s distance, which
represents a symmetrized approximation to the KullbackiLeibler diver-
gence (Topsoe, 2000). In this work, we use the overlap as deﬁned in
Equation (9) with p: 1, which we refer to as model overlap, as this dir-
ectly represent the time-averaged, expected likelihood of one model under
the other. In this form, it has been applied by Lorenz et al., (2007) to
discriminate dynamic models based on the distributional ﬁt performance.
In Schenkendorf et al., (2009b), it is used to optimize an initial condition
for a substrate uptake model to discriminate two competing kinetic
approaches.

2.4 Estimation of nonlinear PDF mapping

If the solution h(t, 0) can be obtained in closed form, it is straightforward
to derive the model response PDF for a given parameter PDF using
Equation (5). However, in most of the cases, the model response h(t, 0)
for a speciﬁc parameter realization is obtained by numerical integration.
Here, besides random sampling techniques based on Monte-Carlo
simulations, the approximate model response PDF may also be obtained
by deterministic sampling, e.g. by simple enumeration, optimized Latin
hypercubes of the parameter space and application of Equation (5).
For an inﬁnite number of samples, the true model response PDF
can be constructed from these samples, which can be used for a
subsequent evaluation of Equation (9) to judge the quality of a given
design. Such procedures become computational inefﬁcient for
increasing number of model parameters and cannot be used in an opti-
mization framework. Therefore, an approximation has to be made.
From initial data, one may obtain accurate estimates for the true
parameter PDF, e.g. by MCMC sampling, which can be approxim-
ated by unimodal normal PDFs p(_)(0) : N019, 29), possibly
multivariate. The model response PDF can also be approximated by
py]m(y, t, u(t)) : N(uy]m(t, u(t)), Emma, u(t))). Then, the integration in
Equation (8) can be performed to yield the approximate overlap

both depend on the model structure m, measurement time point t, stimu-

instance, Jebara et a]. (2004). For n, discrete measurement time points I],
the approximate mean overlap is then

Um]

This approximation dramatically reduces the computational costs as
only the two ﬁrst statistical moments (i.e. expectation and variance-
covariance) need to be estimated. The task of solving Equation (5) to
obtain model-response PDFs and subsequent integration of Equation
(11) to evaluate the discriminative power of a given design in an opti-
mization framework is then reduced to estimate the time course of mean
vector My]m(l,ll(l)) and variancewovariance matrix Ey]m(l,ll(l)) of two
model response PDFs for given parameter expectation um," and vari-
anceicovariance 29]," (Fig. 1). As true mean and variancewovariance of
the parameters are unknown, these are replaced by their estimates, i.e.
#6.) —> E[®] and Ba) —> C[®], which we will do in the following. Note
that for skewed PDFs one should apply a transformation, e.g. BoxiCox
or inverse hyperbolic sine transformation to achieve normality of the
PDF (Box, 1964; Johnson, 1949). In this way, our presented robust
OESD method is not restricted to normal PDFs only.

Estimates of response expectation and variancewovariance can be ob-
tained by linearizing the system at additional computational costs that
scale linear with the number of parameters using forward-sensitivity ana-
lysis. But this approach can become suboptimal or yield even misleading
designs (Section 3.2). On the additional expense of 0013) estimates may
be improved by a quadratic approximation of the system, which may
become infeasible for larger systems, as do Monte Carlo-based
approaches. Worst-case approaches yielding a minimax design have
also been proposed to take model response variabilities into account
(Walter and Pronzato, 1997; Skanda and Lebiedz, 2012). However,
these are in general NP-hard (Du and Pardalos, 1995). The sigma-point
method has an additional computational expense of 0(ng), which com-
pares to linearization.

2.4.] Estimation based on linearization The classical approach to
estimate model response variabilities is linearization of the nonlinear
model mapping h(t, 0) with respect to the parameters. The linearization
of the model response is given by applying the chain rule to Equation (2)

y£(t, 0) = h(1319]) + S(l, y)T ]B:E[(.,](0 - E191), (12)

with response sensitivity matrix S(t, y) = WSXU, x) + W and state-
sensitivity matrix Sx(t, x) = 2%, which can be obtained by solving

with initial condition Sx(t0,x0) along the systems dynamics, which is
known as the forward-sensitivity matrix equation. The additional com-
putational effort is of order 0(ngx), as only m;x additional ODEs have to
be solved in Equation (13), since  = 0"x M"! . One may also formulate an
adjoint system to derive the state'sensitivities in a backward manner or
use numerical differentiation.

path constraints and stable behavior with respect to variations in the
control and parameters.

Direct simultaneous: A full discretization of the problem, e.g. control
vector and state/response vector parameterization, is based on or-
thogonal collocation on ﬁnite elements. If the design problem in-
cludes nonlinear path constraints, this solution approach can be
beneﬁcial, because feasibility of the solution is ensured at the collo-
cation points of each ﬁnite element.

Both NLP approaches are typically non-convex, i.e. there exist several
local and possibly one global optimal design solution. Therefore, resulting
solutions to the NLP problem are local optima. Global optimality of the
design can be achievedibut is not ensurediby (i) performing local op-
timizations from different initial starting points and/or (ii) deterministic/
stochastic/heuristic global optimizers (Floudas and Gounaris, 2009;
Horst et al., 2000; Zabinsky, 2003). We point out that optimal design
solutions need not necessarily be global in real-life applications. Local
optimal solutions can be very close to the global solution with respect to
the design criterion. Therefore, non-convexity allows to account for fur-
ther experimental constraintsirestricting the degrees of freedom in the
design spaceiwithout losing, e.g. discriminative power. In the applica-
tions, we use global stochastic and multistart optimizations to avoid a
biased comparison between linearization and sigma-point approach.

3 APPLICATION

3.1 Application 1: signaling cascade

The highly conserved mitogen—activated protein kinase signaling
cascade (Pearson et al., 2001) with two different hypothesized
negative feedbacks is used as a nonlinear test system for bench—
marking the two design approaches with respect to estimation
accuracy and design quality. Multistep signaling cascades are
enrolled in many signal—transduction processes of cells to sense
and react to external signals. Upon an external stimulus, e.g.
growth factor, hormones or stress signals, cascades transduce
the signal from the cell membrane to the nucleus to start different
cell programs. The respective ODE systemsiadapted from

The measurement response signals are deﬁned as

y1m(t)=x’2‘m(t)+0g and y2m(t)=x’§m(t)+0g, (18)

where 06 represents additive measurement noise, which we
assume to be normally distributed with zero mean and variance
of. We assume that the response signals can be measured at 11,
speciﬁc time points. Based on an initial stimulus design, we
adjust the model parameters so that both model responses
match up to a small error, which does not allow to prefer one
over the other model, to mimic the starting point of an OESD for
model discrimination. Identifiability of the models has been
checked with the software tool DAISY in combination with
global sensitivity analysis (see Supplementary Material, Bellu
et al., 2007; Sobol’, 1993). Because biological systems often
follow a log—normal distribution, we apply a log—normal trans—
formation to the response to improve the normal approximation
used in the estimation approaches for the response PDF
(Sections 2.4 and 2.4.1). Therefore, we redefine the response
signal Equation (18) used for the overlap calculation as

EMU) = 10g(y.~m(t) + A), (19)

with i = 1, 2, A >0. For each model, we assume that all dynamic
parameters are log—normally distributed, with nominal value
being the expectation E10g[®]=0 and diagonal covariance
matrix 1/C10,g[®] = diag(nEL0g[®]), with scaling parameter n.
The measurement noise is typically independent on the stimulus
design and thus held constant at as = 0.01. The sigma—points for
the log—normal parameter PDF are obtained in the following
way: In the parameter space, we derive the normal equivalents
of log—normal expectation and covariance to calculate the normal
sigma—points, which we then exponentiate (see Supplementary
Material). The log—normal sigma—points are propagated through
the model, including Equation (19), to obtain the normal esti—
mates via Equations (16) and (17). In the following, we drop the
tilde from the redeﬁned response signal in Equation (19).

Following the direct sequential approach, the stimulus (single
input) is parameterized as

as an additional

u(U,t)=uk for tkftftk+la

with [U]k = (uk,dtk)T,k e {0, ...,n,,}, whereas dtm, E 0. Here,
uk represents the amount of stimulus between the time point tk
and tk+1 = dtk +Zf:0t,. If for the last time point, we have
t,,”<t)-, we put u(U,t,,u<t 3 t1) 2 14"”. On the other hand, if
t,,” >t), the design is given a penalty. Depending on the estima—
tion method 8 6 {AS}, the resulting optimization problem for
discriminating between models A and B is formulated as an NLP
problem (see Supplementary Material for details), i.e.

optimization framework for large systems. Therefore, approxi—
mate descriptions of the PDFs and nonlinear mapping process
between parameter and model response space have to be used.
Here, we have presented a nonlinear design approach based on
the sigma—points within the application of model—based OESD
aimed at model discrimination. We illustrate the application and
performance in combination with two numerical approaches
from optimal control for two nonlinear model examples. Using
the overlap as a robust design criterion based on the model re—
sponse PDFs, we show that in the case of nonlinear models with
widely distributed parameter PDFs, the sigma—point predictions
and designs consistently outperform a linear design approach. In
the case of bi—(multi)stability, we further illustrate the beneﬁt of
the nonlocal propagation property. Finally, the sigma—points
come with several numerical advantages, including linear scaling
of the numerical costs with respect to distributed parameters and
derivative free estimation of nonlinearly mapped expectation and
variancewovariance. The latter property allows applying a
robust OESD to dynamic models that have non—smooth
right—hand side functions, e.g. cybernetic models of cellular me—
tabolism (Ramkrishna, 1982).

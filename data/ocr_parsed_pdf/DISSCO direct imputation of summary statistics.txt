Abstract

Background: Imputation of individual level genotypes at untyped markers using an external
reference panel of genotyped or sequenced individuals has become standard practice in genetic
association studies. Direct imputation of summary statistics can also be valuable, for example in
meta—analyses where individual level genotype data are not available. Two methods (DIST and
lmpG—Summary/LD), that assume a multivariate Gaussian distribution forthe association summary
statistics, have been proposed for imputing association summary statistics. However, both meth—
ods assume that the correlations between association summary statistics are the same as the cor—
relations between the corresponding genotypes. This assumption can be violated in the presence
of confounding covariates.

Methods: We analytically show that in the absence of covariates, correlation among association
summary statistics is indeed the same as that among the corresponding genotypes, thus serving
as a theoretical justification for the recently proposed methods. We continue to prove that in the
presence of covariates, correlation among association summary statistics becomes the partial cor—
relation of the corresponding genotypes controlling for covariates. We therefore develop direct im—
putation of summary statistics allowing covariates (DISSCO).

Results: We consider two real—life scenarios where the correlation and partial correlation likely
make practical difference: (i) association studies in admixed populations; (ii) association studies in
presence of other confounding covariate(s). Application of DISSCO to real datasets under both
scenarios shows at least comparable, if not better, performance compared with existing correl—
ation—based methods, particularly for lower frequency variants. For example, DISSCO can reduce
the absolute deviation from the truth by 3.9—15.2% for variants with minor allele frequency <5%.

1 Introduction

Recent large international efforts, including the International
HapMap Project (The International HapMap Consortium, 2007,
2010) and the 1000 Genomes Project (Abecasis et (11., 2012; The
1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010), have provided compre—
hensive catalogs of genetic variants and linkage disequilibrium (LD)
patterns in various populations around the world. Using these pub—
licly available data as reference panels, imputation of individual
genotypes at untyped variants has facilitated recent genome—wide as—
sociation studies (GWAS) and meta—analysis (Berndt et (11., 2013;
Chambers et (11., 2011; Dastani et (11., 2012; Huang et (11., 2012).
Therefore, when individual level genotype data are available in
study samples, it has become a standard practice to perform geno—
type imputation (Auer et (11., 2012; de Bakker et (11., 2010; Duan
et (11., 2013; Li et (11., 2009; Pasaniuc et (11., 2012).

Unfortunately, individual level genotype data are not always avail—
able, particularly in multisite meta—analysis GWASs that can include
many individual study GWASs. The process of gathering proper
institutional human subjects research approval, including formal
data—sharing agreements, can be very time consuming. Association
summary statistics, on the other hand, are routinely available and are
not subject to the same human subjects research bottlenecks. Two
methods have been proposed recently to directly impute association
summary statistics at untyped markers in the absence of individual
level genotypes (Lee et (11., 2013; Pasaniuc et (11., 2014). Both methods
assume the summary statistics across typed and untyped markers fol—
low a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Gaussian models have been
routinely used in other related genetic applications (Conneely and
Boehnke, 2007; Wen and Stephens, 2010). For both imputation meth—
ods using association summary statistics, the correlation structure
between the summary statistics is estimated based on the LD structure
between the corresponding markers in an external reference panel(s).
Both methods assume that the correlations between the association
summary statistics are the same as the correlations between the geno—
types at the corresponding markers.

In this study, we provide a general analytical proof that in the
absence of confounding covariates, estimating the covariance struc—
ture between summary statistics using marker LD information be—
tween the corresponding markers is reasonable. However, in practice,
confounding covariates are often present. In particular, we consider
two scenarios: association studies including genetically admixed indi—
viduals (Scenario I) and association studies in the presence of general
confounders (Scenario II). In Scenario I, the underlying LD between
markers among participants in the usually cosmopolitan reference
panel, obtained from the public domain likely differs from the corres—
ponding LD among subjects in the study sample. In Scenario H, we
consider the presence of general confounder covariates or mediators,
such as socialeconomic factors, environmental factors, etc., which are
inevitable in real association studies; for example, the adjustment of
body mass index (BMI) for association with risk with diabetes
(Narayan et (11., 2007), smoking with lung cancer (Wynder and
Hoffmann, 1994), Duffy dose for white blood cell count (WBC)
(Reiner et (11., 201 1), just to name a few. For Scenario I, we propose to
use the top principal components (PCs) to adjust the correlation esti—
mates. For Scenario II, we develop a unified framework for DISSCO
to deal with general confounders and mediators.

2 Methods

2.1 Existing methods for the imputation of association
summary statistics

Two methods for direct imputation of association summary statistics
(Lee et (11., 2013; Pasaniuc et (11., 2014) have been proposed recently.

Both of these methods assume a multivariate Gaussian distribution
on the association summary statistics across typed and untyped
markers. The correlation structure between the summary statistics is
estimated based on the LD structure between the corresponding
markers using an external reference panel(s). Denote the vectors con—
taining summary, or Z, statistics at typed and imputed/untyped
markers as Zr and 2,, respectively. Denote the correlation matrices
containing the correlations between the typed markers estimated
from the study sample and reference panel as iiimsm y and

[it , respectlvely, and the correlatlon matrlces conta1n1ng the
correlation estimates between typed and untyped markers in the study

sample and reference panel as Zn an M , respectlvely.
DIST (Lee et (11., 2013) uses the following formula to impute the

summary statistics for the untyped variants contained in Z;

ImpG—Summary and ImpG—SummaryLD are normalized versions
of DIST (Pasaniuc et (11., 2014), designed to improve the perform—
ance in finite samples. Specifically,

In addition, ImpG—Summary and ImpG—SummaryLD adopt a regu—
larization procedure similar to ridge regression to adjust for statis—

2.2 Theoretical motivation

We and others (Han et (11., 2011, 2009; Kostem et (11., 2011; Pasaniuc
et (11., 2014) theoretically justify existing methods in the absence of
confounders (Supplementary Material S1). However, the justification
fails when confounders exist. In this study, we show that in the pres—
ence of confounders, the correlation between the association summary
statistics is the partial correlation, conditional on the confounders, in—
stead of the marginal correlation between the corresponding marker
genotypes (Supplementary Material S2). The result implies that when
partial and marginal correlations differ confounders need to be prop—
erly incorporated for more accurate imputation of association statis—
tics. Herein, we describe our method, direct imputation of summary
statistics allowing covariates (DISSCO), which addresses this issue.

2.3 Motivating simulations

We first conducted proof—of—principle simulations to confirm the
theoretical findings that (i) Z statistics estimated in two simple linear
regression models without confounding covariates have correlations
close to the correlation between two predictor variables and (ii) Z
statistics estimated in two multiple regression models with the same
set of confounding covariates have correlation close to the partial

correlation instead of the marginal correlation between two pre—
dictor variables.

2.4 Our DISSCO imputation method

Both DIST and ImpG—Summary/LD assume that the correlations be—
tween the association summary statistics are the same as those be—
tween the corresponding marker genotypes. In the presence of
confounding covariates, we have shown both analytically and
through proof—of—principle simulations (results in Sections 3.1 and
3.2) that the correlations between the summary statistics are the par—
tial correlations instead of the marginal correlations between the
genetic markers. Thus, we propose our method DISSCO based on
partial correlations as below:

+ AI, and the elements in

are equal to partial correlations. We follow the

tion procedure. To achieve a desirable balance between performance
and computational efficiency, we only include markers within a pre—
specified window size of each untyped maker of interest. The impact of
including only closely linked markers is negligible, as markers further
away have little effect on the estimation of the summary statistic for
the untyped marker given the low LD between these markers and the
untyped marker of interest. Similar strategies were adopted by DIST
and impG—Summary/LD. We provide more details in the Section 5.

We describe two real—life scenarios where the correlation and
partial correlation likely make practical difference.

2.4.1 Scenario 1: admixed samples

Genotype imputation in admixed populations is particularly chal—
lenging due to increased genetic heterogeneity across study partici—
pants and a deficit of well—matched reference panels. Considerable
efforts have been devoted to the selection of ancestry appropriate
reference panels for imputation (Egyud et al., 2009; Huang et al.,
2009; Pemberton et al., 2008). However, even after the selection of
an appropriate ancestry—matched reference panel, between—study
heterogeneity makes the naive uniform utilization of the same
phased reference panel for different study samples suboptimal.
Commonly used Markov model—based methods for the imputation
of individual level genotypes, including IMPUTE (Marchini et al.,
2007), IMPUTE2 (Howie et al., 2009), MaCH (Li et al., 2010), min-
imac (Howie et al., 2012), MaCH—Admix (Liu et al., 2012) and
Beagle (Browning and Yu, 2009), alleviates this issue by modeling,
separately for each study, the genetic data from the study sample to—
gether with genetic data from the reference panel when phasing the
individual reference haplotypes. Unfortunately, this approach is
only possible when there is individual level genotype data available
from the study participants.

Motivated by the common analytic practice used for controlling
for population stratification, DISSCO employs the following PC—
analysis—based procedure for the imputation of summary statistics in
admixed participants: (i) perform LD—based SNP pruning using
PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007), (ii) construct PCs using EigenSoft
(Patterson et al., 2006) on the study samples and reference samples
together using the pruned set of markers, (iii) perform single marker
association analyses controlling for the top PCs to obtain a Z statis—
tic for every typed marker and, finally, (iv) perform imputation of

the Z statistics at untyped markers by DISSCO. A unique aspect of
this scenario is that the PCs in the reference and study samples are
obtained in a unified manner from a single PCA analysis (Step 2). In
contrast, general confounding covariates that are directly measured
in study participants are typically not available among reference
individuals.

2.4.2 Scenario 1]: in the presence of general confounding covariates
Similar to any association analysis, in GWAS, it is often necessary to
control for other confounders, or possibly mediators, such as demo—
graphic information, environmental exposures and lifestyle factors.
In GWAS, a single—marker analysis using a multiple regression
framework is typically adopted to simultaneously model each single
marker of interest together with covariates, including those that
could confound the association. As aforementioned, unlike PCs,
which can be directly obtained in a unified manner for both the ref—
erence and study individuals by applying PCA, general covariates
available in study samples are often not available in the reference
population.

We project the relevant covariates into the reference participants
based on the covariate values in the study participants and the
observed genotypes at the typed markers within a window (window
defined the same manner as in Pasaniuc et al., 2014), surrounding
the subset of markers currently being imputed, in both the study and
reference samples. We use these imputed covariates, which we call
‘pseudo—covariates’, to calculate partial correlations in the reference

sample. To obtain these pseudo covariates, we first regress the cova—

riates C on genotypes at typed markers in the study sample, ( ﬁrmly),

and estimate the regression coefficients by If:
([1 Gimdyj’ﬂ Gimdyj)_1[1 Gimdyj’C and sample residuals 8A: C

— [1 Gimdy]. We then project the pseudo—covariates into the refer—

ence samples using the estimated regression coefficients from the
study samples and the genotypes in the reference samples, by

6 refer : [1 Gﬁem] IT+8*, where 8* is a bootstrap sample of

Based on these ‘pseudo—covariates’, we then calculate
Eimrmm and :ETCMWM. Finally, we apply the DISSCO formula
to impute the Z statistics at untyped markers. The entire process is
repeated across all possible windows of genotyped markers spanning

the genome to obtain imputed summary statistics for all markers.

2.4.3 Covariate projection accuracy and impact on partial
correlation estimation

In our DISSCO framework, covariate projection accuracy, particu—
larly its impact on the estimation of partial correlations, is the key fac—
tor that determines the gains over existing methods. We therefore
performed simulations to evaluate both the accuracy of the projected
covariates and the impact of the projected covariates on the partial
correlation estimates the association summary statistics calculations.

relation between the two Z statistics. Neither BU, BC nor V affects the values
of the partial or marginal correlations. Therefore, without loss of generality,
we set BU =1, 33:1 and V=1.

3 Simulation Results

3.1 Gaussian predictors and covariate

We first consider the case where the predictors of interest (X1 and
X2) as well as the confounder (C) follow a Gaussian distribution.
We simulated a random vector (C X1 X2) following a standard tri—
variate Gaussian distribution with correlations pcx1 . pcx2 and
pX1 X2. We then generated the response variable y : [30 + ﬁCC + 8,
where 8 is an independent Gaussian random variable with mean
zero and variance V. We fit the following two models, mimicking
GWAS single marker analysis, to obtain Z statistics testing the asso—
ciation between X1 (X2) and Y controlling for C: Y ~X1 + C and
Y N X2 + C.

We considered eight different model settings, reflecting different
combinations of (pCX1.pCX2.pX1X2), and conducted 10000 simula—
tions for each model based on 300 observations (Table 1). We
observed that in all settings, the point estimate of the correlation be—
tween Z statistics, $2122 , was considerably closer to the true partial
correlation pX1X21C than to the marginal correlation pX1 X2 . The 95 %
confidence interval for ﬁzlzz always included the partial correlation
but not the marginal correlation (except under Setting 6 where the
two correlations were simulated to be identical). For example, in
Setting 7, where the marginal correlation was positive (0.3) but par—
tial correlation was negative (—0.38), the point estimate of the
correlation between the Z statistics was —0.37 and the 95 % confi—
dence interval was [—0.38,—0.35].

3.2 Multinomial predictors (G1 G2) and Gaussian

cova riate

To mimic the discrete nature of observed genotypes, we simulated a
categorical vector (G1 G2) containing genotypes at two typed
markers. Here too, we found that the correlations of the Z statistics
are consistent with the partial correlations and not marginal correl—
ations, for all settings examined (Supplementary Material S3). For
example, in Setting 2, where the marginal correlation is positive
(0.223) but the partial correlation is negative (—0.6), the point esti—
mate of the correlation between the Z statistics was —0.6 with a cor—
responding 95 % confidence interval [—0.6 12,—0.5 87].

3.3 Covariate projection accuracy and its impact on
partial correlation estimation and association summary
statistics imputation

Although the ultimate goal of DISSCO is to impute association sum—
mary statistics, one key factor inﬂuencing its capability to achieve
this goal is the accuracy of partial correlation estimates based on

any projected covariates. We therefore first evaluated the accuracy
of DISSCO’s covariate projection and then its impact on the estima—
tion of partial correlations via simulations. We observed that the ac—
curacy of the covariate projection depends on the extent of the
correlation between the typed markers and the covariate(s) to be
projected. However, regardless of the absolute level of projection ac—
curacy, the partial correlations among typed markers can be better
estimated: the partial correlation estimator based on projected cova—

riates, i.e. ﬁ ‘CA better approaches pX1X21C than ﬁxlxz across all

XIXZ
settings. The difference can be dramatic: for example, for Setting 2
when true partial correlation pX1X21C : 0.133, EX X ‘6: 0.132 but
1 2

ﬁxlxz : 0.5 (Supplementary Table S3A). Partial correlation esti—
mates between typed and untyped show mixed results, but in general,
through covariate projection and subsequent partial correlation esti—
mation based on the projected covariates, DISSCO tends to generate
more accurate imputed Z statistics than approaches that ignore the
confounding. Details are documented in Supplementary Material S4.

4 Real data analysis

We applied DISSCO, DIST’F, ImpG—Summary’VLD” (where "' indi—
cates our own implementation of existing methods) to two real data—
sets: (i) the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study; and (ii) the
Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) study.

4.1 Real data set 1: WHI African Americans

WHI was established by the National Institutes of Health in 1991 to
address major health issues causing morbidity and mortality in post—
menopausal women (Anderson et al., 1998). The SNP Health
Association Resource (SHARe) consortium genotyped 8421 African
Americans in WHI using the Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping platform.
Standard quality controls were applied previously (Reiner et al.,
2011), including removing markers with call rate <90%, Hardy
Weinberg equilibrium exact test P—value < 1076, or sample minor al—
lele frequency (MAF) < 1%.

4.1.1 WHI Scenario 1: accommodating admixture via PCs

We randomly masked 20% of the markers as untyped markers.
Because of the instability in the estimated correlations for markers
with MAF< 1%, we imputed and compared the performance of
DISSCO, DIST" and ImpG—Summary’VLD” for markers with
MAF > 1%. Our final dataset contained 653 877 typed markers and
162 443 untyped markers with MAF > 1%.

We first used PLINK to prune the typed markers (—pairwise 0.1).
We then applied EigenSoft on the pruned markers to obtain PCs for
the study and reference (from 1000 Genomes Phase I v3) samples,
using default parameters. The phenotype we examined was BMI. We
first regressed BMI on age and the proportion of African ancestry esti—
mated using FRAPPE (Tang et al., 2005) to remove their effects. We
then used the residuals to perform single marker association analyses
for all markers, adjusting for PCs only, to evaluate DISSCO’s PCA—
based procedure for imputation in admixed populations.

For the masked experimental genotypes, we obtained the true Z
statistics, denoted by Z?. The Z statistics at typed markers Z? were
used to impute Z statistics at the untyped markers by DISSCO,
DIST"' and Imp—Summary’l/LD’F, which are denoted by ZPISSCO,

I s I 5 LD
ZPIST, Zimp “mm” and Zimp ummary . We evaluated the performance

of these methods using three measures (i) D: the absolute deviation
between true and imputed Z statistics, (ii) %D: the absolute relative
percentage deviation between the difference of the true and imputed

We evaluated the average performance of all four methods
across all 162 443 untyped markers without any post imputation fil—
tering and across the subset of 150 5 34 markers where 1:2 pred > 0.6
for ImpG—Summary’i/LD” and DIST’F, and 1:2 predCO > 0.6 for
DISSCO. In addition, for each marker and competing approach, we
tabulated whether the Z statistic estimated by DISSCO was closer
than the Z statistic estimated by the competitor to the true Z statistic
and we conducted a one—sided Wilcoxon signed rank test to test the
null hypothesis that there was no difference in accuracy between the
different approaches. We found that DISSCO provided imputed
summary Z statistics at the untyped markers that were, on average,
consistently more accurate than the other approaches across all
quality metrics and marker sets (Table 2). Based on the individual
marker results, DISSCO significantly outperformed all three com—
petitors (P < 0.001 for all three comparisons).

4.1.2 WHI Scenario 1]: accommodating general covariates

We performed a second comparison between DISSCO and the exist—
ing methods using a GWAS of WBC, for which the Duffy blood
group null variant is known to account for 15—20% of the variation
among African Americans and is, therefore, routinely controlled for
in association studies (Auer et al., 2012; Reiner et al., 2011). Besides
the Duffy variant, we additionally performed covariate adjustment
for age, BMI and African ancestry. We again randomly masked
20% of markers as untyped markers and imputed those with
MAF > 1 %. In this analysis, our final set contained 150 934 imputed
variants.

We conducted single—marker association analyses with natural—
logarithm transformed WBC, adjusting for the aforementioned
covariates. We again evaluated the performance of all four methods
by comparing the imputed with true summary statistics, which were
established using masked experimental genotypes.

Results summarized in Table 3 indicate superior performance of
DISSCO over existing methods in the presence of general confound—
ing covariates, with or without post—imputation quality filtering.
Similar to the results for BMI, based on the individual marker re—
sults, DISSCO significantly outperformed all three competitors
(P < 0.001 for all three comparisons).

4.2 Real data set 2: CLHNS study

To evaluate the performance in a relatively homogeneous study sam—
ple, we applied all methods to another dataset, the Cebu
Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) study (Adair
et al., 2011). The study genotyped 1800 Filipino women using the
Affymetrix Genomewide Human SNP Array 5.0 GWAS chip (Lange
et al., 2010). The 1800 subjects were previously found to be rela—
tively genetically homogeneous and match closely to the East Asians
(specifically, CHB [Han Chinese from Beijing] and JPT Uapanese
from Tokyo]) in the International HapMap Project (Marvelle et al.,
2007).

Our outcome measure was adiponectin levels, an adipocyte—se—
creted protein involved in a variety of metabolic processes, including
glucose regulation and fatty acid catabolism. Several recent studies
have examined the genetic association with adiponectin (Croteau—
Chonka et al., 2012; Dastani et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2010). We per—
formed association analyses adjusting for age, household assets, nat—
ural logarithm transformed income and waist circumference. We
again masked 20% of the directly typed markers and excluded

markers with MAF< 1%. Our final set contained 265 340 typed
markers, which were used for imputation, and 65 992 untyped
markers that were imputed using Phase I v3 ASN haplotypes (http://
csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/MACH/download/1000G.2012—03—14.
html) from the 1000 Genomes Project.

Results summarized in Figure 1 and Table 4 again show advan—
tages of DISSCO over existing methods in the presence of general
confounding covariates, both before and after post—imputation qual—
ity filtering of markers. Similar to the results for WHI, based on the
Wilcoxon sign rank test across the individual marker results,
DISSCO significantly outperformed all three competitors (P < 0.001
for all three comparisons).

4.3 More pronounced improvement for lower frequency
variants

Interestingly, we found that DISSCO had more pronounced sum—
mary statistic improvements for lower frequency variants. Figure 2,
for example, shows the performance of all methods across the entire
MAF spectrum in the CLHNS dataset. Compared with existing
methods, DISSCO had an average of 7.5—12.3% lower absolute
relative deviation from the true value for markers with MAF < 10%
while the improvement reduced to 3.2—8.4% for markers with
MAF > 10%. Similar results were obtained for the WHI dataset and
presented in Supplementary Materials S6.

5 Discussion

Two recent studies have proposed methods for direct imputation of
summary statistics that approach the quality of gold standard geno—
type—based imputation, at reduced computational costs. These meth—
ods are valuable particularly for meta—analysis studies when
individual level genotypes are not readily available. Both methods
assume summary association statistics follow multivariate Gaussian
distributions, with the correlations between the summary statistics
being the same as the correlations between the corresponding
marker genotypes that are estimated from publicly available refer—
ence panels.

In this study, we show analytically that, in the presence of con—
founders, the correlation matrix among the summary statistics is the
partial correlation matrix among the corresponding markers, condi—
tional on the confounders. With this theoretical underpinning, we
propose DISSCO for direct imputation of summary statistics accom—
modating confounding covariates.

We consider two scenarios where covariate adjustment can be
helpful, if not necessary: in the study of admixed samples and in the
presence of other known risk factors and mediators. The first scen—
ario presents the challenge of estimating the correlation matrix ap—
propriate for admixed samples using cosmopolitan reference panels
commonly available in the public domain rather than a single well—
matched reference dataset. Our solution of using PCs can be inter—
preted as sample—adjusted weighting of the reference individuals for
the estimation of the correlation structure. Our PC—based solution in
this scenario of admixed samples also effectively transforms the
issue into the need of controlling for the special covariates: PCs, thus
enabling the unified DISSCO framework under both scenarios.

For practical usage, Scenario I entails the estimation of PCs for
the reference individuals, which can be achieved either by perform—
ing PC analysis on the study and reference samples together, which
is commonly conducted in studies involving admixed samples; or
when PCA is performed on study samples only, one could choose to
project the top PCs in the same manner as general covariates (results
presented in Supplementary Material S7).

DISSCO leads to more noticeable gains for lower frequency vari—
ants. We believe this is largely due to the smaller number of LD tags
(variants in high LD) for lower frequency variants compared with
that for more common variants. For example, based on the 1000
Genomes Phase 1 datasets, we found on average 9.8 (7.6, 5.9) LD
tags (at LD r2 threshold of 0.8) for low frequency variants
(MAF< 5%) and 23.2 (24.4, 8.9) LD tags on average for common
variants (MAF > 5 %) among individuals with European (Asian,
African) ancestry. Since not every marker is affected by confounding
covariates when estimating partial correlations, with more LD tags,
a common variant is less susceptible to the inaccurate estimation of

variant. In Supplementary Material S8, we use simulations to illus—
trate that the performance of methods based on either the partial or
marginal correlation increases with the number of LD tags and,
more importantly, that additional information from covariates leads
to relatively more gains when the number of LD tags is smaller.

Computationally, following ImpG—Summary/LD, DISSCO also
divides each chromosome into non—overlapping blocks with prede—
termined length (1 MB by default). Assume there are p : 17[ +17th

uals in the study sample, Nrefﬂ individuals in reference sample, and
S covariates. After obtaining Z, Z statistics at typed markers, im—

tion of the sample correlation matrix between typed markers, (iii)
generation of reference sample pseudo—covariates, (iv) calculation of

where the subscript “.” differs across methods as detailed in Section
2, and (vi) the normalization of imputed values. All methods need
step (v). DIST also needs (i); ImpG—Summary also needs (i) and (vi);
ImpG—SummaryLD also needs (i), (ii) and (iv); and DISSCO also
needs (i), (iii) and (iv). Computational complexity of (i)—(vi) is

We report in Table 5 the computing time for each of the steps in the
real data sets on a 2.53 GHz Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor. Real—time
using actual software implementation is also reported. The DIST
software takes the longest mainly for two reasons: (i) it re—calculates
the reference correlation matrix within a window of :50 markers
for every untyped marker; and (ii) it uses numerical integration to
calculate P—values from Z—scores. In contrast, ImpGSummary has an
efficient implementation, at the cost heavy I/O burden: thousands of
small intermediate files written to and read from hard disk. Memory

consumption was comparable across the different software, with
1—2 GB maximum RAM for all the real data experiments.

There are multiple other factors that affect performance. Among
them, the important ones are (i) window size, (ii) regularization and
(iii) normalization. Specifically, a larger window size tends to im—
prove performance by providing more information. However, a
larger window size also means increased computational cost.
Including a larger number of typed markers does not guarantee bet—
ter results because the larger number of markers is more likely to
make the correlation matrix singular. As noted by the ImpG—
Summary/LD development team, regularization alleviates this issue
by adjusting for statistical noise in the estimation of the covariance
matrix in the reference sample. Following their work, DISSCO also
uses 1 MB as default window size with regularization. The normal—
ization procedure in ImpG—Summary/LD improves performance in
small samples. Since our focus in this article is on the improvement
of using partial—correlations instead of marginal correlations, we
compare our method to existing methods using the default param—
eter values.

We have primarily focused our performance comparisons be—
tween DISSCO and existing methods by comparing accuracies of
summary Z statistics to their true values. Since DISSCO directly im—
putes association statistics, it is also critical to establish its validity.
Following Pasaniuc et al. (2014), we generated real—data—based null
datasets and found that DISSCO maintains the desired type—I error
rate across a range of nominal values (10—1—10—5) with our default
level of regularization (A : 0.03) (Supplementary Materials S10 and
Tables S5A—D).

Unlike imputation for individual genotypes, the selection of a
reference panel matching the study sample is much more crucial for
the accurate imputation of association summary statistics because
the correlation structure from the reference sample as a whole in—
stead of individual haplotypes are used in the calculations.
Although, when the reference and study samples are similar, these
methods for direct imputation of association statistics tend to work
well (Han et al., 2011), prudency is warranted as discussed in
Pasaniuc et al. (2014). As an illustration, our simulation studies
using a mismatched reference panel (the EUR haplotypes from the
1000 Genomes Project for the CLHNS dataset) resulted in inﬂated
type—I error rates when using our default level of regularization
(Supplementary Table S5E).

Finally, a key step in DISSCO is the projection of covariates into
the reference based on genotypes of typed markers. As top PCs cap—
ture a large amount the variation in these genotypes, it is conceptu—
ally natural to anticipate that projection based on the top PCs (thus
completely bypassing the need of individual level genotypes) might
achieve similar performance gains. We indeed have observed com—
parable performance gains using the top PCs (Table 2) as compared
with using general covariates (Table 3) in the admixed dataset.
Additional analysis in the CLHNS dataset using only the top five
PCs also showed near identical results as in Table 4 (identical up to
the third digit after the decimal point using all three measures, i.e.
D, %D and R2). Although a certain degree of information loss is
possible due to discarding information not captured by the top PCs,
we recommend using the top PCs as a convenient substitute for ac—
tual covariate projection when individual level genotypes are not
available.

In summary, we provide analytical justifications for two meth—
ods recently proposed for the imputation of association summary
statistics in the absence of confounding covariates. We further ex—
tend the analytical work in the presence of confounders and propose
a method accordingly to accommodate confounding covariates. Our
proof—of—concept simulations and applications to two real datasets
demonstrate the value of our method, DISSCO, particularly for low—
frequency variants. Our method is implemented in JAVA and freely
available online http://www.unc.edu/~yunmli/DISSCO/.

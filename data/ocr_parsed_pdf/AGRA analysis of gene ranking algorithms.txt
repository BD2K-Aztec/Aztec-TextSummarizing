ABSTRACT

Summary: Often, the most informative genes have to be selected
from different gene sets and several computer gene ranking
algorithms have been developed to cope with the problem. To
help researchers decide which algorithm to use, we developed the
analysis of gene ranking algorithms (AGRA) system that offers a
novel technique for comparing ranked lists of genes. The most
important feature of AGRA is that no previous knowledge of gene
ranking algorithms is needed for their comparison. Using the text
mining system finding-associated concepts with text analysis. AGRA
defines what we call biomedical concept space (BCS) for each gene
list and offers a comparison of the gene lists in six different BCS
categories. The uploaded gene lists can be compared using two
different methods. In the first method, the overlap between each pair
of two gene lists of BCSs is calculated. The second method offers a
text field where a specific biomedical concept can be entered. AGRA
searches for this concept in each gene lists’ BCS, highlights the rank
of the concept and offers a visual representation of concepts ranked
above and below it.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA microarray is a technology that can simultaneously measure
the expression levels of thousands of genes in a single experiment.
The use of microarray Chips in gene expression analysis requires
an enormous amount of data to be analysed and often, while at the
same time, selecting the most informative genes from different gene
sets.

One of the possible ways to rank the genes is to use a feature
selection (FS) method. FS is a machine leaming-based technique
used to select the most important features for building a robust
learning model. The same FS techniques are now widely used in
bioinformatics for identiﬁcation of biomarkers or lists of relevant
genes from DNA microarray-based gene expression measurements.
There are many FS methods which can be used, but how do
researches know which one is the best? Several different methods

were proposed to estimate the ‘goodness’ of the ranked gene lists
(Ma, 2006; Qiu et (11., 2006). However, these methods usually
need computer experts who know how FS methods and learning
algorithms work. We describe a novel system, analysis of gene
ranking algorithms (AGRA), which allows biologists and other
experts with low or no previous computer knowledge to compare
different FS methods with the help of evidence mined from PubMed.
AGRA uses ﬁnding-associated concepts with text analysis (FACTA),
an online text search engine for MEDLINE abstracts that can quickly
compute the association strengths between a query and different
types of biomedical concepts based on their textual co-occurrence
statistics (Tsuruoka et (11., 2008). While other similar systems exist,
such as XplorMed (Perez-Iratxeta et (11., 2002), MedlineR (Lin et (11.,
2004), LitMiner (Maier et (11., 2005) and Anii (Jelier et (11., 2008),
FACTA was Chosen because of its ability to pre-index words and
concepts, which result in fast, real-time responses of the system.
AGRA needs to process high amount of data, and fast response of
the underlying service is crucial for the efﬁcient delivery of the
results.

AGRA extracts biomedical concepts using FACTA and thus
deﬁnes a biomedical concept space (BCS) for each gene list. BCS
is deﬁned as six categories (gene/protein, disease, symptom, drug,
enzyme and Chemical compound) of ranked biomedical concepts.
To compare the quality of different FS methods, AGRA calculates
the overlap for each pair of two gene list of BCSs. This way, gene
lists which are the product of different gene ranking algorithms can
be compared with a gold standard list. Finally, experts can use their
domain knowledge to search for a speciﬁc biomedical concept in
the ranked gene lists and decide which FS method outputs the most
relevant genes.

2 METHODS

Figure 1 shows AGRA’s main interface with uploaded gene lists. The
application offers a novel way to compare ranked lists of genes with the
help of BCS. BCS is a set of ranked biomedical concepts gathered through
FACTA where they are grouped into six different categories. FACTA can be
queried by inputting a word (e.g. P53), a concept ID (e. g. UNIPROT: P04637)
or a combination of these ‘[UNIPROT: P04637 AND (lung OR gastric)]’.
AGRA calculates BCS for a single gene list in three steps: (i) calculation of
protein BCS; (ii) calculation of gene symbol BCS; and (iii) calculation of
gene list BCS.

To achieve this, each gene symbol from the gene lists is associated
with its protein(s) and their Uniprot IDs are extracted with help of the
Affymetrix annotation ﬁle (HG-U133 Plus 2 Annotations, Release 31).

AGRA then queries FACTA with these Uniprot identiﬁers and maximum
50 most important biomedical concepts (ranked by their frequencies of
appearing in the MEDLINE abstracts) from each category are extracted.
Concepts that are gathered in this step represent six BCS categories of each
associated protein.

Next, BCS categories for the gene symbol are calculated. If the gene
symbol is associated with only one protein, its BCS is identical to the
protein’s one. When the symbol is associated with more than one protein,
the average values of the frequencies in each category are calculated.

In the ﬁnal step, the six categories for each gene list BCS are calculated.
This is done by summarizing values from all gene symbol BCS categories
from the list. Because the order of the gene symbols in the list is crucial,
AGRA weights each gene symbol BCS according to the gene symbol position
in the list. The weight w for single symbol x, is deﬁned as w(x,»)=(n—(i—
l))/n,where n is number of all its concepts and i represents the rank of the
gene that concept belongs to in the gene list (starting from 1).

Finally, to avoid sending queries to the FACTA system too often, AGRA
saves BCSs in a local database. Whenever a gene symbol, for which BCS
has not been deﬁned yet, appears in one of the gene lists, the system queries
FACTA, calculates its BCS and saves it locally.

When BCSs for all gene lists are extracted, AGRA calculates the overlap
values for every combination of two BCSS to evaluate the effectiveness
of FS methods. Overlap is a simple method to measure similarity between
two BCSS where biomedical concepts that appear in both BCS are counted
and divided by the number of concepts in the shorter BCS. Another way
to compare FS methods is to search for the position of relevant biomedical
concepts in the ﬁnal gene list BCS. Position of a single biomedical concept is
deﬁned as it is ranked number among all the concepts in one of the categories.
This way, researchers can decide which FS method selects the most important
concepts and ranks them higher compared with other methods.

3 USAGE OF THE APPLICATION

The usage of AGRA is simple and only basic computer skills are
required. The application consists of three different tabs: main,
overlap and position. The main tab is used for uploading the gene
lists and starting the analysis. The user should upload the lists in a
CSV ﬁle where the ﬁrst row represents gene list names and other

rows represent ranked genes with the most important gene on the
top and the least important gene on the bottom of the list. Due to
the calculation complexity and limitation of the FACTA+ system,
the input ﬁle should contain maximum 7 different gene lists with
maximum 100 genes in each list.

When the ﬁle is uploaded, the ranked genes for each list are
displayed in a table next to each other so they can be visually
compared. Then the user can enter a speciﬁc concept (e.g. ‘breast
cancer’) and select in which BCS category AGRA should look for
the concept. The system can be started with the start button which
is disabled during the analysis. When ﬁnished, the results can be
accessed through the overlap and position tabs.

The overlap tab offers a visual analysis of overlap values for
each pair of uploaded gene lists. Six tables represent six different
categories. The ﬁrst column and the ﬁrst row of each table contain
gene list names and each cell contains an overlap value between
two corresponding lists. The value is coloured according to the
overlap success rate where dark red colour indicates the lowest and
light green indicates the highest overlap. The position tab offers an
analysis of the position of the searched concept in each gene list’s
BCS. With the help of a chart and a table, the user can inspect which
concepts were found by AGRA for each gene list and how they were
ranked. The position of the searched concept is marked.

4 LIMITATIONS

In ﬁiture work, we will address a number of AGRA’s current
limitations. Currently, FACTA uses its internal dictionary for
associating proteins with their UniProt IDs, thus not every gene
is associated with all of its proteins. Newer versions of FACTA will
address this issue. Furthermore, some of the biomedical concepts
found by the system indicate the same term (e.g. ‘Cancer’ and
‘neoplasm’) but they can be ranked in different ways which can
affect the quality of the ﬁnal results.

Abstract

Summary: Next—Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology has revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs)
are capable of exhibiting frequent differences from their corresponding mature reference se—
quences, generating multiple variants: the isoforms of miRNAs (isomiRs). These isomiRs mainly
originate via the imprecise and alternative cleavage during the pre—miRNA processing and
post—transcriptional modifications that influence miRNA stability, their sub—cellular localization and
target selection. Although several tools for the identification of isomiR have been reported, no bio—
informatics resource dedicated to gather isomiRs from public NGS data and to provide functional
analysis of these isomiRs is available to date. Thus, a free online database, lsomiR Bank has been
created to integrate isomiRs detected by our previously published algorithm CPSS. In total, 2727
samples (Small RNA NGS data downloaded from ArrayExpress) from eight species (Arabidopsis
thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Oryza sativa,
Solanum lycopersicum and Zea mays) are analyzed. At present, 308 919 isomiRs from 4706 mature
miRNAs are collected into lsomiR Bank. In addition, lsomiR Bank provides target prediction and en—
richment analysis to evaluate the effects of isomiRs on target selection.

Availability and implementation: lsomiR Bank is implemented in PHP/PERL+MySQL+R format
and can be freely accessed at http://mcg.ustc.edu.cn/bsc/isomir/

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), with average length of 22 nucleotides, are ubi— and/0r translational repression (Bartel, 2004). During this process,
quitously expressed and regulate many essential biological processes the primary miRNA transcripts (pri—miRNAs) are mainly cleaved by

complexes of RNAses HI (Drosha and DGCR8) and give rise to one or
more precursor miRNAs (pre—miRNAs) hairpins. Following Dicer pro—
cessing, the hairpins release short double—stranded RNA. One of the re—
sultant strand (defined as mature miRNA) binds to the protein
Argonaut 2 (Ago2), and gets incorporated into the RNA Induced
Silencing Complexes (RISCs). It guides RISCs to the 3’UTR of mRNAs
by base pairing with fully or partially complementary sequences
(Griffiths—Jones et (11., 2006). Previously, miRNAs were only annotated
as the canonical sequences. However, extensive application of high—
throughput sequencing technology to detect expression profile of
miRNA has revealed that miRNAs can frequently exhibit differences
from their corresponding canonical mature sequences, generating mul—
tiple variants known as isoforms of miRNAs (isomiRs) (Guo and Lu,
2010; Li et (11., 2012; Llorens et (11., 2013; Val et (11., 2013; Wang
et (11., 2008). Generally, the reference miRBase miRNA (having the ca—
nonical sequence) often differs from the most abundant isomiR
(Ameres and Zamore, 2013; Loher et (11., 2014). There are two main
processes that lead to the production of isomiRs. These isomiRs mainly
originate via the imprecise and alternative cleavage (not completely
random) during the pre—miRNA processing and post—transcriptional
modifications that have inﬂuence on miRNA stability, their sub—cellu—
lar localization and target selection (Ameres and Zamore, 2013; Loher
et (11., 2014). On the other hand, miRNA editing is the process that
generates isomiRs by post—transcriptional enzymatic editing of the
miRNA genome (Ameres and Zamore, 2013; Neilsen et (11., 2012). It
has also been reported recently that isomiRs can significantly affect the
half—life of miRNA, as well as their sub—cellular localization and their
target specification (Ameres and Zamore, 2013; Cloonan et (11., 2011;
Li et (11., 2012; Wang et (11., 2008).

Here, we have established a database, IsomiR Bank, to support
and facilitate the ongoing isomiRs research. Our database contains
308 919 isomiRs detected from 2727 samples (Small RNA NGS data
downloaded from ArrayExpress database) of eight species
(Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio, Homo
sapiens, Mus musculus, Oryza sativa, Solanum lycopersicum and Zea
mays) with manually curated metadata for each sample (organism,
sex, tissue, development stage, age, experiment condition, treatment
and sequencing platform). IsomiR Bank also has a user—friendly web
interface allowing researchers to quickly find and navigate the
isomiRs of their interest and related annotation along with the func—
tional analysis that can help in evaluating the effects of isomiR on tar—
get selection and downstream pathways. Our database is not only a
collection of isomiRs from NGS data but also a tool to find out the
candidate functional isomiRs for further experimental studies.

2 Content and construction

The general process of data collection, annotation and model devel—
opment for IsomiR Bank are illustrated in Figure 1 (The detail meth—
ods for IsomiR Bank are provided in Supplementary Information).
IsomiR Bank is developed in a user friendly mode, and includes a
search engine to find the isomiRs of interest. The search option pro—
vides an interface for querying IsomiR Bank either with the sequence
of isomiRs or by the name of miRNA/miRNA family or by the sour—
ces of isomiRs [e.g. tissue]. For example, if an isomiR sequence of
GTAAAGCAAGATAACCGAAAGT is input to the search engine
(Supplementary Fig. S1A), the search results will appear in a tabular

 

format containing species information in which this isomiR has been
reported along with isomiR Sequence, Family Accession (the miRNA
family accession number provided by miRBase for this searched
isomiR’s canonical miRNA), Family Name, Mature miRNA Name
(the canonical miRNA of searched isomiR), Tissue origin,

information of reads per million (RPM) of the isoform, Development
stage, Genotype and Sex (Supplementary Fig. S1A). If users click on
an interested entry in the isomiR Sequence, the database will display a
summary of that isomiR, which is subdivided in four parts as: (i)
IsomiR Source; (ii) Detailed Sample Information; (iii) IsomiR Form;
(iv) Related Canonical miRNA Information; (v) IsomiR Analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). In order to predict the inﬂuence of isomiRs
on targeted gene selection and downstream pathway function,
IsomiR Bank provides target prediction for the isomiRs by miRanda
(www.microrna.org) and then enrichment analysis for these predicted
isomiR targets. When the analysis is finished, the third tab
[Enrichment Analysis] will provide figures to illustrate the effects of
all these isoforms on targets selection (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Moreover, functional enrichment analysis for these affected targets
will also be provided to users. By selecting the Annotation Categories,
users can overview the effect of their selected isomiRs on downstream
biological processes, pathway and enriched protein domains
(Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition to searching by a specific isomiR
sequence or its name, all entries of IsomiR Bank can be browsed by
the name of organism, tissue, miRNA families or by experimental
conditions (Supplementary Fig. S3). In this way, users can browse the
isomiR in a particular species in which the isomiR was identified and
reported, or they can browse isomiR in each miRNA family (The ex—
amples for search and browse option and documentation for IsomiR
Bank is provided in Supplementary information).

3 Discussion

Until now, a number of tools, such as MODOMICS, Squuster,
IsomiRex, MiRGator v3.0 and CPSS have been generated and are in
use for the detection of RNA modifications from small RNA deep
sequencing data (Cho et (11., 2013; Dunin—Horkawicz et (11., 2006;
Pantano et (11., 2010; Sablok et (11., 2013; Zhang et (11., 2012).
However, these tools only focus on isomiRs detection and are unable
to provide the functional annotation for these isomiRs. A public re—
source for recording the detected isomiRs with functional annotations
is highly in demand. Hence, we have established a database, IsomiR
Bank, which is a comprehensive and consistently annotated resource
of miRNA isoforms for eight species. We have collected 2727 samples
for isomiR analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Among them, 977
samples were from Homo sapiens, 207 were from Mus musculus and
1543 were from the other six species. Presently, IsomiR Bank contains
308 919 isomiRs of 4706 mature miRNAs from 813 miRNA families
(The mean number of isomiRs for each mature miRNA is 65.64,

range from 1 to 1850, and other statistical analysis for isomiRs in
IsomiR Bank are provided in Supplementary Information).

We analyzed a number of isomiRs shared between any two species
among the eight species in the database. Interestingly, many isomiRs
are conserved in animals or plants, but a specific isomiR of animals
could not be found in plants and vice versa (Supplementary Table
S1). This observation is consistent with previous studies showing few
miRNAs were known to be structurally or functionally conserved be—
tween plants and animals (Arteaga—Vazquez et (11., 2006; Millar and
Waterhouse, 2005). Moreover, we observed that more conserved
isomiRs could be found within two species having closer genetic/evo—
lutionary relationship (Supplementary Table S1). These observations
suggest that the isomiRs are also conserved like canonical miRNAs
during evolutionary process and they might be involved in regulation
of same biological processes across different species (Ameres and
Zamore, 2013; Cloonan et (11., 2011; Li et (11., 2012; Wang et (11.,
2008).

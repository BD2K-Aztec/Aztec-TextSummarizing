ABSTRACT

Motivation: The prediction and annotation of the genomic regions
involved in gene expression has been largely explored. Most of the
energy has been devoted to the development of approaches that
detect transcription start sites, leaving the identification of regulatory
regions and their functional transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs)
largely unexplored and with important quantitative and qualitative
methodological gaps.

Results: We have developed ReLA (for REgulatory region Local
Alignment tool), a unique tool optimized with the Smith—Waterman
algorithm that allows local searches of conserved TFBS clusters and
the detection of regulatory regions proximal to genes and enhancer
regions. ReLA’s performance shows specificities of 81 and 50%
when tested on experimentally validated proximal regulatory regions
and enhancers, respectively.

Availability: The source code of ReLA’s is freely available and can
be remotely used through our web server under http://www.bsc.es/

1 INTRODUCTION

The identiﬁcation of the genomic regions that control the
transcription of genes still remains a Challenge despite the recent and
continuous development of new experimental and computational
methodologies (Tompa et (11., 2005). Multiple automatic approaches
have been proposed, ranging from those that search for phylogenetic
conservation of sequence or transcription factor binding motifs in
non-transcribed DNA regions (Blanchette and Tompa, 2003; Van
Loo and Marynen, 2009) to the analysis of DNA physical properties
Characteristic of regions expected to bind transcription factors

(Abeel et (11., 2008; Goﬁi et (11., 2007). However, the incorporation
of novel biological knowledge into these programs is not necessarily
improving the quality of their predictions, which still contain a
substantial fraction of false positives.

Currently, methods that de novo detect and Characterize proximal
regulatory regions show speciﬁcity levels <50% (Van Loo and
Marynen, 2009). Even though phylogenetic footprinting using pre-
aligned homologous regulatory regions offers promising results in
the identiﬁcation of Conserved Regulatory Modules (CRMs) of
transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) (Blanchette and Tompa,
2003; Blanco et (11., 2007; Pavesi et (11., 2007; Sebestyen et (11.,
2009; Tokovenko et (11., 2009; Tonon et (11., 2010), they cannot
deﬁne the regulatory region itself in most real scenarios because
they are based on global alignment strategies and require that all
matching binding sites across all compared sequences are located in
the same (or similar) position within each sequence, i.e. they require
predeﬁned and pre-aligned regulatory regions. As a result, in spite of
the existing methodologies, still the most common and reliable way
to identify proximal regulatory regions in genomes is the analysis
of a few nucleotides (typically up to 1000) immediately upstream of
annotated transcription start sites (TSSs), which likely constitutes
the proximal promoter. But the annotation of gene starts is still
unsolved, particularly for non-human species. For example, a simple
search in the ENSEMBL database (Hubbard et (11., 2009) identiﬁed
substantial fractions of vertebrate genes without annotated S’UTR
(from 17% in mouse to 91% in opossum, 42% for human). This
result is even more dramatic within invertebrates. Other problems
that constitute a barrier for the automatic inference of promoters
(even in human or mouse) are the abundance and overprediction of
alternative transcripts. Taken together, most computational methods
that detect or align promoters strongly depend on or are coupled
with the annotation of untranslated gene regions, which is generally
insufﬁcient for this purpose (Guigo et (11., 2006).

On the other hand, the computational identiﬁcation of enhancers
is even more complex. These regulatory regions that work
in cooperation with promoters throughout multiple structural
constraints are, apparently, delocalized relative to the genes that
are controlling (Arnosti and Kulkarni, 2005). Therefore, their
identiﬁcation through computational methods requires strategies

based on local alignments. Some existing methods, like rVISTA,
look for conserved TFBS Clusters between regions that have
been pre-aligned with local alignment tools, such as BLASTz in
rVISTA (Loots and Ovcharenko, 2004), while others use directly
local alignment-based search strategies, like the Enhancer Element
Locator (EEL) that uses the Smith—Waterman algorithm (Palin et (11.,
2006). These tools have shown good prediction rates on enhancers,
and also show important limitations regarding the number of species
that they can analyse, the required parametrization and the accuracy
of the prediction.

To overcome these limitations, and to provide novel and improved
solutions to the prediction of regulatory regions, we have developed
ReLA, a public local-based alignment tool that is capable of
detecting promoters and enhancers by identifying Clusters of
regulatory motifs conserved in any position within large homologous
DNA regions (i.e. independently of gene annotation). Considering
the wide range of potential users of this tool, we have also developed
a user-friendly web server for remote predictions. The source code
of ReLA is distributed also as a standalone program that can be used
locally in Unix-based computational platforms.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 From DNA to TFBS sequences

The ﬁrst step of our method consists on the mapping of putative TFBSs
sequences along the input sequences according to a certain catalogue of
position frequency matrices (PFMs) (in the documentation included with the
program and in the web server. we provide guidance for selecting a set of
homologous sequences). Users locally running ReLA should provide their
own PFM ﬁles (information about accepted ﬁle formats is also provided
with the program and in the web server). It has been shown that the
selection of particular collections of matrices yields slightly different results
(Blanco et (11.. 2006b). After evaluating different options (data not shown).
we obtained the optimal results by using PFMs from TRANSFAC (Matys
21111.. 2006). We classiﬁed this collection of models into three subsets: whole
collection of TRANSFAC PFM. the ﬁrst 600 and the ﬁrst 400 PFMs ranked
by their information content. These three sets are included as the default
option in the web server. The identiﬁcation of potential TFBSs is performed
using the MATSCAN software (Blanco at (11.. 2006b) at high levels of
stringency: 80% of similarity threshold. For this study. we calculate the
similarity score using SS 2 [(current 7 min)/(max 7 min)]. where. ‘current’
is the actual matching score. ‘min’ is the minimum possible matching score
and ‘max’. the maximum possible matching score of a particular PFM. as
described elsewhere (Kel at (11.. 2003). Since the next SmithiWaterman
step requires a single sequence of TFBSs. and because MATSCAN results
usually contain PFM that overlap in all possible ways. we next simplify
this output. We remove this overlap by sliding a window of n bp (n=3 or
5. both conditions are included in the global search. see below). For each
overlapping PFM starting at the ﬁrst position of each of the 3 or 5 nt sliding
window. we systematically kept the most informative one. maximizing the
overall information content of the sequence. To preserve the relative distance
between motifs during the comparison. we insert a ‘spacer box” every n
consecutive nucleotides in regions free of predictions. In summary. we
convert each input DNA sequence into a sequence of highly informative
non-overlapping TFBS. which is used next in the comparative searches.

2.2 Comparative searches

For our searches. we have modiﬁed the classical local alignment Smithi
Waterman algorithm (Smith and Waterman. 1981) to deal with sequences
of TFBSs (associating a unique three-letter combination to each TFBS) and
to provide the best scoring local alignment (i.e with the highest density

of conserved TFBSs) for each of the comparisons performed between the
reference sequence with each of the others (see pseudocode in Supplementary
Material). The overall stringency of the searches. the reliability of the
resulting predictions and the conservation of the TFBSs between the input
sequences can produce different predictions. Instead of selecting a universal
and ﬁxed set of parameters for each of the searches. which would yield one
unique prediction. we chose to run recursively each pairwise comparison
(reference sequence against each of the other input sequences) with a
different set of parameters generating a collection of preliminary predictions.
A set of posterior selection ﬁlters (see below) is then applied on these
preliminary predictions to come up with a ﬁnal prediction of the promoter
region.

Each of these pair-wise comparisons is carried out in two different scoring
scenarios (10/—1 and 20/—1 match/mismatch scores. both with an open
and extension gap penalties of —2 and with two overlapping thresholds
to remove redundant sites (using a window of three or ﬁve nucleotides.
see above); i.e. a total of four comparisons are performed on each pair of
sequences and each set of matrices deﬁned. These speciﬁc combinations of
parameters were determined by monitoring and maximizing the relationship
between sensitivity and speciﬁcity using a collection of 10 known promoters
of the ABS database (Blanco et (11.. 2006a) (see Supplementary Material and
www.bsc.es/cg/rela/downloads). These 10 regions were excluded from the
performance evaluation. We also observed that the best predictions obtained
during the benchmarking were those with sizes between 200 and 600 nt.
Preliminary predictions covering shorter regions usually involved too few
conserved TFBSs. while larger predictions tend to connect distant and.
apparently. unrelated binding sites. For this reason. preliminary predictions
outside this range of sizes are not considered during the generation of the
ﬁnal prediction.

2.3 Output generation

As part of the results. ReLA generates a graph showing the distribution
of all accepted preliminary predictions on the reference sequence. From the
analysis of the overlap among these preliminary predictions. we generate the
ﬁnal prediction by selecting the region. between 200 and 1000 nt long that
contains the highest number of preliminary candidate predictions. Together
with the ﬁnal prediction on the reference sequence. additional consensus
regions are also deﬁned in each of the other sequences. which correspond to
those (if any) that match the ﬁnal predicted promoter region. We also provide
the list of all conserved TFBSs. From this list. a subset of the most conserved
TFBSs (speciﬁcally. those within the top 10% of conservation) is selected
and used to generate a multiple alignment in graphical format.

2.4 Web server

We have implemented ReLA as a web server that can be accessed at
http://www.bsc.es/cg/rela. The underlying search engine is distributed also
as a standalone program. We have designed the ReLA website to meet the
requirements of non-expert users. The web version provides a graphical
representation of the putative promoter region predicted in all the input
sequences (Fig. 5) and a plain text description of the results. As many as
two suboptimal solutions can be provided through the web on each set of
input sequences to potentially predict alternative promoters.

2.5 Selection of databases for evaluation

To validate the results obtained and to compare our method with other
existing programs in similar searching conditions. three different working
subsets or reported regulatory regions were generated from three different
databases: Annotated regulatory Binding Sites database [ABS; (Blanco et (11..
2006a)]. Eukaryotic Promoter Database [EPD; (Schmid et (11.. 2006)] and
Vista Enhancer Database Browser [VISTA; (Visel et (11.. 2007)] To follow
common criteria and to be consistent with the annotation of ABS (as
500 nt promoters). we transformed these TSS into regions by considering
as promoter region 500 bp upstream from the EPD TSS. VISTA Enhancer

ReLA

 

Browser is a database of regions containing experimentally validated human
and mouse enhancers tested in transgenic mice.

The working subsets were generated according to three different ﬁlters to
facilitate the automation of the validation process and to ensure reliability
of the evaluation protocol: (i) genes associated to selected regulatory
regions must have at least three orthologous one-to-one genes according
to ENSEMBL orthology data; (ii) the promoter fragments selected should
not overlap with coding regions; and (iii) they have to be in our scanned
region: as described in the Section 3. for ABS and EPD it is 500 bp upstream
of the ﬁrst codon of the gene. and for Vista. 50000 bp upstream of the closest
gene (see below).

Applying these three ﬁlters we obtained 75 human and mouse promoters
from ABS. and 740 from EPD. In both cases. 5000 bp upstream from the ﬁrst
methionine were used to check and compare the accuracy of the method.
From VISTA Enhancer Browser. we ended up with 44 enhancers laying in
the 5000 bp upstream of a known gene.

2.6 Evaluation protocol

For the evaluation of the promoter prediction programs. we followed a
modiﬁed version of the Distance-based validation evaluation protocol from
Abeel et a1. (2009). Taking into account that we were evaluating promoter
genes and we were considering distances. we calculated recall and precision
values as

Precision 2 correct predictions / total predictions

Recall =discovered genes / total genes

For those programs that provide single positions as outputs (TSS predictors.
ARTS. Eponine and Promoter Explorer). we considered the sequence :l:500
from TSS for the evaluation. In the case of TFM. we obtained conserved
binding sites as result and considered the fragment between the ﬁrst and
the last one for evaluation. A correct prediction was considered if there was
an overlap between the prediction and the 500 bp upstream of the deﬁned
TSS. For all programs. we considered the unique or the best prediction.
except for Promoter Explorer that does not rank the results. Since we were
using already ﬁltered promoter genes instead of big DNA fragments. we did
not discarded any prediction further of 500 nt from the TSS as it is done
elsewhere (Abeel et (11.. 2009). For all programs of our evaluation. we used
default settings deﬁned by the corresponding developers. For EEL runs. we
used the mouse and human sequences for each of the orthologous groups
and applied the parameters described for this species pair elsewhere (Palin
at (11.. 2006). All the data used for the validation procedure are available at
www.bsc.es/cg/rela/downloads.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Rationale and underlying search strategy of ReLA

The goal of this study is to develop a novel methodology that would
overcome the current limitations mentioned above by focusing on:
(i) the detection of conserved TFBS; (ii) the use of local search
strategies; (iii) simplicity of use; and (iv) a low computational cost
to perform genome-wide searches. For this, we decided to use

Table 1. Performance results on ABS promoters

the same strategies that have been used for fast local sequence
comparisons of protein sequences. In particular, we adapted the
Smith—Waterman algorithm (Smith and Waterman, 1981) to make it
capable of comparing and detecting the best optimal local alignment
of regions with similar sequences of TFBSs. In our procedure,
each TFBS is internally transformed into symbols of an arbitrary
alphabet, as if they were amino acid or nucleotides in traditional
protein—protein and DNA—DNA comparative searches. This search
algorithm is the core of a pipeline, referred from now on as
ReLA (for REgulatory region Local Alignment tool). The complete
procedure can be divided into three major steps. First, input DNA
sequences are transformed into sequences of TFBSs by mapping
with the MATSCAN software (Blanco et (11., 2006b) all the PFMs
provided; secondly, the resulting TFBS sequences are compared
with each other to identify conserved groups of TFBSs using
the modiﬁed Smith—Waterman algorithm under different scoring
scenarios. Finally, all the resulting preliminary alignments are
evaluated to produce the ﬁnal prediction of the promoter region.

3.2 Evaluation of ReLA’s performance

We ﬁrst applied ReLA to a collection of experimentally validated
promoter and enhancer regions, both to deﬁne its internal search
parameters and to evaluate its performance. Despite ongoing efforts
of acquiring experimental data, on ﬁinctional TFBS, still the
vast majority of detailed and reliable data can only be retrieved
from the literature. In this direction, the ABS database (Blanco
et (11., 2006a) is the result of one of the few initiatives to gather,
from the literature, promoters with two or more of their TFBSs
experimentally validated. For this reason we used this database for
ReLA’s evaluation. We selected the subset of 73 (35 human and 38
mouse) promoters from this database that showed, in ENSEMBL
(Hubbard et (11., 2009), one-to-one orthologous relationship with
at least three out of seven Chosen vertebrate species (human or
mouse, rat, horse, dog, cow, opossum and Chicken). By reproducing a
common and realistic search scenario, where the TSS and 5’UTRs of
query homologous regions are not known, we collected the putative
upstream region of these genes and their corresponding orthologous
regions. These upstream regions comprise 5000 bp upstream DNA,
from the ﬁrst annotated codon according to the encoded ENSEMBL
protein. From the measurement of the length of 5’UTRs regions of
‘known’ ENSEMBL genes, we previously had estimated that this
selection of 5000 bp is sufﬁcient to capture the proximal promoters
for >85% of known vertebrate genes (data not shown). In addition,
we have also compared the resulting performance of ReLA with the
prediction ratio of other reported TFBS-based search tools: TFM
(Tonon et (11., 2010) and rVISTA (Loots and Ovcharenko, 2004),
as well as with that of TSS predictors: ARTS (Sonnenburg et (11.,
2006); Eponine (Down and Hubbard, 2002) and PromoterExplorer
(Xie et (11., 2006), all of them run on the same regions (Table 1).

Following the same strategy, we alternatively evaluated ReLA
using 740 regions derived from the Eukaryotic Promoter Database
[EPD; (Schmid et (11., 2006)], which, despite not being ideal for
this purpose, sets our tool into the context of previous evaluations
of these other existing search strategies: ARTS, Eponine and
PromoterExplorer against which we have also compared ReLA’s
predictions (Table 2).

From all resulting predictions, we calculated different
performance parameters, such as recall and precision by adapting
an evaluation protocol used for the comparison of a large number
of TSSs predicting methods (Abeel et (11., 2009). This adaptation is
necessary because the different methods we used provide different
type of outputs, e.g. ARTS, Eponine, PromoterExplorer provide
single TSS positions, TFM and rVISTA lists of conserved TFBS,
and ReLA delimited regions of conserved TFBSs.

From the results of this evaluation, we observe that the
overall performance is different between the different methods and
databases: while ReLA’s performance was the best on ABS entries,
PromoterExplorer on EPD regions outperformed it. Interestingly,
ReLA’s precision values for EPD regions are lower than those
shown with ABS. To discard a possible bias in the performance
of ReLA towards speciﬁc promoter types that are more abundant
in the ABS database, we divided all EPD and ABS regions in
different promoter Classes (Section 2) and calculated the same
precision values for each promoter type and each prediction method
separately (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). This analysis has
shown that, despite ABS appears to be enriched in TATA-box
containing promoters (a 42% versus a 20% in EPD), ReLA’s
performance is not affected by this, as precision values are similar
among most of the promoter types present in ABS and EPD. It is
also worth noticing that predictors based on TFBSs show a better
performance on the ABS, which is also based on TFBS, than with the
TSS-based EPD entries, where TSS predictors tend to do better. We
did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant difference when comparing performance
values for Human or Mouse entries (data not shown).

In order to have a sense of the TFBS conservation levels, upon
which ReLA is able to build predictions, we have also analysed
the distribution of the number of conserved boxes detected within
all ABS and EPD results. This analysis shows that, indeed, there
is a wide range of TFBS conservation, both in number and in
composition (Supplementary Fig. S1). Similarly, from the analysis
of the contribution of each of the species in ReLA’s performance,
we observe that all the other vertebrates used in this study contribute
substantially to the ﬁnal prediction in human: for example, cow and
dog contribute to ~60% of the predictions whereas opossum and
Chicken to 36 and 32%, respectively (Supplementary Table S3).

A detailed inspection of ReLA’s results on ABS entries uncovered
some interesting features. Often, the promoters that we identiﬁed
on each of the species present different locations within the input
5000 bp region (Fig. 1). This typical scenario, which must be
necessarily solved with local-based comparative approaches, is

observed when the annotation of orthologous gene 5’UTRs and
ﬁrst exons is practically absent, as occurs for most of the available
genomes. These results highlight the potential of using ReLA for
the systematic identiﬁcation and annotation of regulatory regions in
non-model organisms, such as Chicken, cow, dog, opossum and any
other that has incomplete gene and CDNA data.

3.3 Prediction of multiple alternative promoters

During the evaluation of ReLA, we also observed that, in
some cases, the distribution of preliminary predictions along
the reference sequence highlighted two regions with similar
scores, which could correspond to alternative promoters. From
these two options, ReLA selects the one that generated more
preliminary predictions (Section 2). Suboptimal solutions, i.e.
potential alternative promoters, can be obtained by simply masking
the previously predicted regions in the reference sequence and
running ReLA again. For a number of such cases, we conﬁrmed
the presence of two TSSs through the analysis of ESTs or known
alternatively transcribed full-length mRNAs. For this reason, we
have implemented this option in the web server, where the user
can launch a second search run to ﬁnd suboptimal solutions.
Figure 2 shows the best two predictions of regulatory regions located
upstream from SLC7A7, an amino acid transporter gene, which
has been experimentally proven to have two alternative promoters
(Puomila et (11., 2007).

The ﬁnding of two high scoring regions in any ReLA prediction
could suggest, instead of the presence of an alternative promoter, the
existence of highly conserved coding exons, which would constitute
a false positive prediction. Thus, the identiﬁcation of regulatory
regions with ReLA would be based only on the level of sequence
conservation and the presence of highly conserved non-regulatory
DNA, like coding exons, could negatively inﬂuence the results.
To discard this, we studied how this scenario can affect ReLA
predictions. The example in Figure 3 shows a positive promoter
prediction when all seven orthologous input sequences include the
complete region of the E2F1 gene and the additional upstream
untranslated regions (a total of 15000 nt each). In this case, the
distribution of hits along the human sequence shows two high
scoring regions that appear to share similar conservation levels of
nucleotides. One of these fragments constitutes the third exon of
this gene, while the other matches the 5’UTR, the TSS and the
core promoter. ReLA is able to successﬁilly discriminate the correct
promoter region, including sites that have been experimentally
proven (Blanco et (11., 2006a). In particular, the two TFBS that
ReLA scores highest in conservation among input sequences are
precisely described in the ABS database as two E2F1 factor binding
sites necessary for self-regulation during the transition from G1 to S
phase in the cell cycle (Johnson et (11., 1994). Interestingly, the third
TFBS following the conservation ranking corresponds to ADF1,
which was located within the 5’UTR and is known to bind the same
motifs recognized by the E2F1 factor in mice (Hsiao et (11., 1994)
Despite these results, we cannot discard the possibility that exons
are wrongly predicted as promoters in certain situations. Therefore,
we recommend performing preliminary evaluations of the coding
potential within the input sequences, for example, by comparing
them against protein sequence databases with BLASTX (Altschul
et (11., 1997). Putative coding regions should be preferentially
masked from the input sequences to ensure the correct prediction.

the identiﬁcation of enhancers, which are often located distant from
other functional elements. In order to test ReLA’s capabilities in
enhancer detection we have gathered a collection of experimentally
validated human enhancers from the VISTA database with activity
assessed on transgenic mice (Visel et (11., 2007). To test ReLA,
we selected 44 enhancers that are located within the ﬁrst 50000 bp
upstream of a known gene. In order to search for each of these
distal regulatory regions we extracted up to 50000bp from the
most upstream TSS annotated for the Closest gene in human and
from each of the corresponding one-to-one orthologous genes in
mouse, rat, horse, dog, cow, opossum and Chicken. The ﬁrst run of
ReLA on these 44 regions generated 40 predictions, from which
11 (28%) overlapped with the annotated enhancer. Considering
that the regions selected for the search theoretically contain other
unknown regulatory regions (promoters, for instance) that could
match with the ﬁrst prediction, we performed a second run on
the remaining 29 cases, which yielded nine other positive hits. In
total, with two iterative runs, ReLA showed a positive predictive
value of 50% of the screened subset of annotated human enhancers.
A similar prediction rate (49%) is obtained over the same enhancer
benchmark set when using a speciﬁc enhancer locator tool, EEL
(Palin et (11., 2006) that also relies on local search strategies (EEL
searches implied only human and mouse sequences, as it does not
accept more than two sequences per search). It is worth mentioning
that an important difference between both methods is that ReLA
provides more precise results, as the regions predicted are shorter
(up to 750 nt long, with an average of 485 nt) than those coming
from EEL (up to 11563 nt, with an average of 2644 nt).

These results indicate that ReLA is capable of searching large
genomic DNA fragments and identifying multiple proximal and
distal regulatory regions, which makes this tool suitable for
genome-wide screenings and across several genomes (see an
example in Fig. 4).

To further exemplify this feature, we also performed a genome-
wide analysis on a 109 kb long ENCODE region [ENm011;
Chr11:1858751-1968592; (Birney et (11., 2007)] that includes six
genes coding for, at least, 11 transcripts, with their corresponding
intergenic regions. By using SYT8 and MRPL23 ﬂaking genes

as anchors, we identiﬁed and Characterized the corresponding
orthologous regions for mouse, rat, dog, cow and Chicken. The
complete analysis consisted in 10 iterative ReLA searches and
implied the screening of TFBS sequences in >600kb of genomic
DNA. In order to obtain an estimation of the performance on these
genome-wide conditions, we have taken as positive predictions
those that match ChIP-Seq transcription evidences (Birney et (11.,
2007), as well as those falling immediately upstream of annotated
gene starts. This count shows that 8 out of 10 predictions have
evidence of expression or regulation (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Please note that we cannot discard that additional runs would provide
other overlooked regulatory regions and, at some point, also false
positives.

4 DISCUSSION

Taking into account the available methods to in silico recognize
gene regulatory regions, a substantial improvement is necessary to
accurately annotate genes and promoter sequences in most genomes.
Here we report the development of ReLA, a computational tool to
identify such regulatory regions using genome-wide comparisons.
ReLA is distributed as a standalone program and as a web server.
Our approach is mostly based in an adaptation of the popular Smith—
Waterman algorithm that is able to rapidly identify coincidences of
TFBSs between two sequences (conceptually similar to traditional
protein—protein comparisons). ReLA is able to efﬁciently process
long sequences in standard computational platforms (e.g. less than
a minute to obtain the results shown in Fig. 5). We have evaluated
the accuracy of ReLA, ﬁrst in a dataset of experimentally validated
human and mouse promoters, on an extensive collection of validated
TSS from the Eukaryotic Promoter Database, as well as on an
experimentally validated collection of rVISTA enhancers. We have
reached maximums of 0.81 of recall and precision levels on ABS
sequences On the other hand, and surprisingly, ReLA’s performance
results lower when using EPD TSS entries. A possible explanation
for this observation could be that ReLA performs better on certain
types of promoter regions. But, after we Classiﬁed all ABS and EPD
entries into different promoter types according to their composition
and evaluated their associated performance obtained with all the
methods used here for the validation, we observed that ReLA’s
accuracy is similar among most of the identiﬁed promoter types.
We cannot discard though that other uncontrolled biases present
either inside the underlying search methodology of each of the
protocols used here or in the used databases could actually explain
the different behaviour observed. It is worth noticing that overall,
TFBS-based prediction methods perform better on the TFBS-based
ABS database than on the TSS-based EPD, where TSS predictors are
doing better. In any case, the levels of precision and recall obtained
with ReLA are sufﬁcient to provide reliable predictions that guide
posterior experimental validation. This study also demonstrates the
beneﬁts of using the Smith—Waterman algorithm to directly search
for conserved binding sites, as it outperforms other methods like
rVISTA and TFM, that are based on pre-aligned DNA and global
search strategies. See the example in Figure 1, which cannot be
solved using global alignment approaches. Please note that other
methods based on similar strategies could not be included in the
comparison, as they did not provide results on our benchmark set
because of limitations in the size (MMETA) and on the number of
sequences [Conreal (Berezikov et (11., 2005)].

Furthermore, we also show that ReLA is able of predicting
alternative promoters and even enhancer regions, dealing with
multiple suboptimal solutions in most cases. Our approach is
suitable for integrating a computational annotation pipeline in which
other predictive methods such as homology searches (e.g. BLAST
against protein databases) can assist in the improvement of the ﬁnal
predictions.

In summary, we believe that the development of ReLA constitutes
a signiﬁcant step forward in the ﬁeld of the prediction of regulatory
regions, as it shows the highest predictive power reported so far.
ReLA is able to locally compare multiple large genomic regions
and identify non-alignable conservation events across different
genomes. This is relevant if we consider that the limited information
regarding regulatory regions in eukaryotes is restricted to human

Promoter Database (Schmid et (11., 2006), 2067 (81%) belong
to these two species. Thus, with this tool in hand we can now,
not only ﬁll missing gaps in the annotation of the genomes of
model organisms, mostly with the identiﬁcation of enhancers and
alternative promoters, but also to start a reliable and consistent
annotation of conserved promoters throughout the rest of genomes
that have little or no information regarding 5’UTRs and often ﬁrst
coding exons (Fig. 1). Beyond the current performance of ReLA
and, as we are planning a genome-wide search of regulatory regions

across sequenced vertebrate genomes, we are actively searching for
ways of improving ﬁirther its predictive power by, for example,
applying more sophisticated scoring systems and accepting even
larger DNA regions with low additional computational costs.

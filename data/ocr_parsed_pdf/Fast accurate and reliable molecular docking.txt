Abstract

Motivation: The need for efficient molecular docking tools for high—throughput screening is grow—
ing alongside the rapid growth of drug—fragment databases. AutoDock Vina ('Vina’) is a widely
used docking tool with parallelization for speed. QuickVina ('QVina 1’) then further enhanced the
speed via a heuristics, requiring high exhaustiveness. With low exhaustiveness, its accuracy was
compromised. We present in this article the latest version of QuickVina ('QVina 2’) that inherits
both the speed of QVina 1 and the reliability of the original Vina.

Results: We tested the efficacy of QVina 2 on the core set of PDBbind 2014. With the default
exhaustiveness level of Vina (i.e. 8), a maximum of 20.49—fold and an average of 2.30—fold acceler—
ation with a correlation coefficient of 0.967 for the first mode and 0.911 for the sum of all modes
were attained over the original Vina. A tendency for higher acceleration with increased number of
rotatable bonds as the design variables was observed. On the accuracy, Vina wins over QVina 2 on
30% of the data with average energy difference of only 0.58 kcal/mol. On the same dataset, GOLD
produced RMSD smaller than 2A on 56.9% of the data while QVina 2 attained 63.1%.

Availability and implementation: The C++ source code of QVina 2 is available at (www.qvina.org).

1 Introduction significant for local search. This improves QVina 2’s reliability in
discovering the minimum—energy docking conformation.

AutoDock Vina—also referred to as Vina—employs the iterated
local search global optimizer to search for the minimum—energy
docking conformations (Trott and Olson, 2010). Subse uentl ,

QuickVina—referred to as QVina 1 hereinafter—enhanced Vina’s

 

computation time via heuristics that prevents unnecessary local
searches. As proof of concept, QVina 1 needs high exhaustiveness
level compared to the original Vina (Handoko et (11., 2012). Here,
we present the most recent QuickVina—referred to as QVina 2—
with improved reliability. QVina 2 avoids the unnecessary local
searches in a similar manner to QVina 1. In contrast to QVina 1,
however, QVina 2 misses fewer necessary local searches thanks to a
new procedure to test if a randomized docked conformation is

Vina explores the molecular docking search space by means of glo—
bal and local optimization, in the forms of Markov chain of modi—
fied Monte Carlo algorithm with restart and BFGS method,
respectively. The local search is the most time—consuming part of the
optimization. QVina 1 restricts the application of local search to
those docked conformation candidates deemed to be significant by
the first—order—necessary-condition heuristics. This is enabled by
keeping track of 10N last—assessed docked conformations in circular

database where N is the number of the design variables. For each
newly randomized candidate of docked conformation p, as many as
2N nearest (in terms of Euclidean distance) neighbors are retrieved
from the database and then the significance test is performed to de—
termine if local search from p is necessary.

QVina 2 enhances the significance test by introducing the novel
first—order—consistency-check heuristics. Like in QVina 1, a newly
randomized docked conformation p is deemed as significant for
local search if there exists a conformation q among its 2N nearest
neighbors such that with respect to each design variable,

this condition to minimize the number of necessary local searches
that are missed. If p fails (1) with respect to the design variable x,, p
is still significant for local search if it passes the following test.

The rationale behind (2) is that if p’s derivative with respect to x,- is

11,-. Reversed relation between the score f(p) and f(q) applies when
p’s derivative with respect to x,- is negative. For illustration, see
Figure 1 of the Supplementary Materials.

3 Results

The efficacy of QVina 2 was assessed on the core set of the 2014
release of the PDBbind dataset which contains 195 protein—ligand
complexes. These are considered as high—quality benchmarks for
evaluating various docking/scoring methods (Cheng et (11., 2009;
Wang et (11., 2005).

Vina, QVina 1 and QVina 2 were first compiled on a CentOS
release 6.0 x86_64 machine with 16 Intel Xeon 2.27—GHz
X7560 CPUs and 98 GB of RAM. The same testing methodology (i.e.
the search space definition as well as the RMSD calculation) as that
observed in the original Vina (Trott and Olson, 2010) was adopted.
For each receptor—ligand complex in the benchmark set, all three

docking tools were given the same random number seed and initial—
ized with the same randomized ligand conformation. We then expli—
citly set both the number of CPUs available for use and the
exhaustiveness level to 8. For completeness of comparison, we also
docked the same receptor—ligand complexes using GOLD 5.2 and
Dock 6 .6 .

Figure 1 summarizes the accelerations attained by QVina 1 and
QVina 2 over the original Vina under different numbers of active
rotatable bonds in the range of [0, 10]. Summary on the complete
range can be found in the supplementary materials. Figure 2 then
shows the RMSD between the actual PDBbind conformations and
the predicted ones produced by employing various docking tools.
Defining a successful prediction as one with RMSD less than 213‘,
the numbers of successes and failures of the various docking tools
are summarized in Table 1. The results indicate that QVina 2 has
the highest consistency with Vina among the other docking tools.
On the accuracy against the experimental conformations, Dock 6.6
is slightly more accurate than QVina 2 at the expense of long com—
putation time. Dock 6.6 attained 127 successes while QVina 2
achieved 123. Meanwhile, GOLD 5.2 only had 111 successes.

4 Conclusion

QuickVina 2 is a fast and accurate molecular docking tool. Tested
against 195 protein—ligand complexes that compose the core set of
the 2014 release of the PDBbind using default exhaustiveness level
of 8, QVina 2 successfully attained up to 20.49—fold acceleration
over Vina. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient between Vina’s and
QVina 2’s binding energy was 0.967 for the first predicted mode
and 0.911 for the sum of all predicted modes. It is also witnessed
that QVina 2 is more accurate than GOLD 5 .2 and is only slightly
less accurate than Dock 6.6. This shows that QVina 2 has paved the

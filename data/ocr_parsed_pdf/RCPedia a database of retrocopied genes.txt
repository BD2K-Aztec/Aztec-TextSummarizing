to align all RNA—seq reads against genomic loci containing intra—
genic retrocopies (Wu and Nacu, 2010). Then, we selected only
the alignments (alignment score >20) that showed two separated
blocks (distance between blocks: >42 nt), where one read over—
lapped the retrocopy and the other aligned with the host gene.
Alignments that were not deﬁned by a canonical splicing site
(GT—AG) were also ﬁltered out. Intragenic retrocopies that con—
tained at least ﬁve reads and showed this alignment pattern were
considered to be expressed. Second, we searched for retrocopy
expression per se by aligning all the reads against their respective
genomes and transcriptomes. The alignment against the tran—
scriptome data was important for removing false positive align—
ments derived from exon#exon junctions. Only unique genome
matches (alignment score: >40) that were ﬁltered by aligning
them with the transcriptome data were used for gene expression
analysis. At least ﬁve supporting reads were required for a retro—
copy to be considered as expressed.

3 DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION

RCPedia is a database and a front—end interface. The database
was build over MySQL (http: //www.mysql.com). The website was
developed mainly using PHP (http://www.php.net) based on
CakePHP (http://cakephp.org) as the framework for the develop—
ment of an efﬁcient Model—View—Controller front—end. All gen—
omic annotation and gene expression data were processed
using Perl (http://www.perl.org) scripts developed in—house.
Brieﬂy, all coding transcripts from RefSeq (and Ensembl for gor—
illa) were downloaded and aligned against their respective refer—
ence genomes using BLAT [(Kent, 2002) with the following
parameters: —mask 2 lower; —tileSize = 12; —minIdentity = 75;
—minScore= 100]. All alignments were processed and sequences
with >75% identity, and either a sequence alignment length >50%
or, at least, 120 matched nucleotides, were selected. Based on the
expected genomic characteristics for retrocopies, we designed a
four—step strategy to identify them. First, any alignment contain—
ing gaps >15kb in length was eliminated. This step eliminated
transcripts with large (large) introns but kept retroelements,
such as Long Interspersed Elements (LINEs) (~6 kb) and Short
Interspersed Elements (SINEs) (<1kb), that are frequently in—
serted inside retrocopied loci. Second, we retrieved the exoni
exon boundary positions from the parental genes. Next, we
mapped these boundary positions onto the retrocopies and
searched for gaps between them. Putative retrocopy alignments
that contained one or more gaps were excluded because they are
unlikely to have been derived from retroduplications. Third, only
gene copies that contained >50 nt from two or more exons of the
parental genes were selected. Finally, we deﬁned the retrocopy set
by selecting all remaining alignments and, if necessary, grouping
any alignments that were mapped onto the same genomic locus
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

4 DATABASE QUERY INTERFACE AND OUTPUT
VISUALIZATION
4.1 The query system

The RCPedia query system is easy—to—use, complete and fast. It
includes gene (e. g. GAPDH), chromosome (e. g. chrl7), genomic

position orientation (e. g. chr17:28 102 500729 112200), gene alias
(e.g. RAS) and gene annotation keyword (e.g. kinase or onco—
gene) searches, making it easy for the user to explore the genes
and genomic locations that match their retrocopy events.

4.2 Results

Because there are many unnamed retrocopies, the search output
results in RCPedia are based on parental gene names. The results
of a query can be presented from two data visualization perspec—
tives: (i) the parental gene perspective, which helps the user to
visualize all retrocopied events of a given parental gene, as well as
their genomic loci, and their identity to retrocopies, for example
(for the full dataset, see the website) and (ii) the retrocopy per—
spective, which displays information, such as their genomic con—
text, identity to the parental gene, conservation in other species,
and retrocopy expression (see Supplementary Fig. S2 for a sche—
matic view).

5 USING RCPedia

To show how RCPedia can be used, we selected the human gene
DHFR as a sample query. RCPedia reported five retrocopies for
DHFR in the human genome (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Interestingly, one of the retrocopies was present only in the
human genome. Another retrocopy was expressed in four
human tissues (Supplementary Fig. S2), and it was reported pre—
viously that this locus is expressed and has a putative function
(McEntee et al., 2011).

6 CONCLUSION

RCPedia is a well—organized, user—friendly and streamlined
graphical representation resource dedicated to the study of retro—
copies in primate genomes. To the best of our knowledge,
RCPedia is the most comprehensive and publicly available data—
base in this ﬁeld, although some resources providing similar in—
formation (Karro et al., 2007; Khelifi et al., 2005; Ortutay and
Vihinen, 2008). We strongly believe that RCPedia will signiﬁ—
cantly improve the annotation and functional characterization
of retrocopies present in primate genomes.

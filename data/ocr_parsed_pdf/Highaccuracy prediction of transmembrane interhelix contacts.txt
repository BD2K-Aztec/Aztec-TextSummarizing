ABSTRACT

Motivation: Residue—residue contacts across the transmembrane heli-
ces dictate the three-dimensional topology of alpha-helical membrane
proteins. However, contact determination through experiments is diffi-
cult because most transmembrane proteins are hard to crystallize.
Results: We present a novel method (MemBrain) to derive transmem-
brane inter-helix contacts from amino acid sequences by combining
correlated mutations and multiple machine learning classifiers. Tested
on 60 non-redundant polytopic proteins using a strict leave-one-out
cross-validation protocol, MemBrain achieves an average accuracy
of 62%, which is 12.5% higher than the current best method from the
literature. When applied to 13 recently solved G protein-coupled recep-
tors, the MemBrain contact predictions helped increase the TM-score
of the l-TASSER models by 37% in the transmembrane region. The
number of foldable cases (T M-score >0.5) increased by 100%, where
all G protein-coupled receptor templates and homologous templates
with sequence identity >30% were excluded. These results demon-
strate significant progress in contact prediction and a potential for con-
tact-driven structure modeling of transmembrane proteins.

1 INTRODUCTION

Membrane proteins constitute ~30% of the proteins in both pro-
karyotic and eukaryotic genomes (Adamian and Liang, 2006),
and they participate in various crucial cellular processes, from
basic small-molecule transport to complicated signaling pathways
(Elofsson and von Heijne, 2007). It has been shown that >50% of
current drug targets are membrane proteins (Hopkins and
Groom, 2002), where the top four gene families of Food and
Drug Administration-approved drugs are all membrane proteins;
i.e. G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), nuclear receptors,
ligand-gated ion channels and voltage-gated ion channels
(Overington et al., 2006). Membrane-embedded alpha-helical
polytopic proteins constitute the majority of ion channels, trans-
porters and receptors in living organisms. This class of proteins,

which accounts for ~40% of all membrane proteins, is infam-
ously difﬁcult for high-resolution structural studies. Due to the
intrinsic structural plasticity associated with many of these
proteins, the chance of obtaining crystals suitable for X-ray or
electron diffraction studies is small Warov—Yarovoy et al., 2006).
Although helical membrane proteins have many experimental
difﬁculties, their structural conformation has been demonstrated
to be predictable in a number of ways, e. g. transmembrane helix
(TMH) domain topology (Krogh et al., 2001; Shen and Chou,
2008).

Structure prediction of the TMH bundle for alpha-helical mem-
brane proteins can be fulﬁlled by ﬁrst predicting TMHs and then
applying helix-packing constraints (White, 2003). The first step of
the TMH prediction has a long history, and the current methods
can achieve an accuracy of ~90% (Nugent and Jones, 2009; Shen
and Chou, 2008). In the second step, it has been widely acknowl-
edged that residueiresidue contact maps contain crucial con-
straints for ab initio assembly of protein structures. In the past 5
years, several methods have been proposed to predict inter-TMH
residue contacts and TMHiTMH interactions from the primary
sequence. These approaches generally can be classiﬁed into two
categories: (i) correlated mutation analysis (CMA)—based
approaches [e. g. HelixCorr (Fuchs et al., 2007)], and (ii) machine
learning (ML)-based methods [e. g. TMHcon (Fuchs et al., 2009),
TMhit (Lo et al., 2009), MEMPACK (Nugent and Jones, 2010)
and TMhhcp (Wang et al., 2011)]. CMA-based approaches iden-
tify co-evolving residue pairs that tend to be in contact from mul-
tiple sequence alignments (MSAs). ML-based methods predict
inter-TMH residue contacts by training statistical models using
various sequence-derived features. The predicted contacts are
used to predict TMHiTMH interactions. Despite the progress,
there is much space for improvement.

First, in the case of CMA-based approaches, the performance
depends highly on the number of aligned sequences in MSAs.
For example, the recent CMA-based residue contact prediction
algorithm PSICOV (Jones et al., 2012) performs poorly on the
CASP hard targets, which tend to have few homologous
sequences (Di Lena et al., 2012). This indicates that contact
prediction based on CMA alone is insufﬁcient. Second, from
ML point of View, inter-TMH residue contact prediction is an
imbalanced learning problem, where the number of samples in
different classes (contact versus non-contact) differs significantly.
Existing ML-based methods use random under-sampling

(He and Garcia, 2009) to select the negative samples. Except for
random forest in TMhhcp (Wang et al., 2011), which used 100
decision trees, all the existing predictors were trained with a
single model using a 1:1 or 1:4 ratio of contact and non-contact
samples. There is no single best ML algorithm because each has a
different mathematical hypothesis. Therefore, an ensemble clas-
sifier constructed by applying multiple algorithms on multiple
training sets can combine the diversities among different pre-
dictors and yield better results (Shen and Chou, 2006). Third,
in all the existing ML—based models, feature vectors of two resi-
dues are serially concatenated together. Although this serial com-
bination is widely used, the doubled feature vector dimensions
may decrease performance due to over-ﬁtting effects of high-di-
mensional data. The parallel strategy is another feature fusion
approach Wang et al., 2003), which represents the two vectors as
real and imaginary parts in a complex space. The benefit is that
the dimension of the obtained complex vector is the same as the
vector of each residue, which we show improves performance.

In this study, we present a novel method called MemBrain to
predict inter-TMH residue contacts by merging an ML—based
engine with the CMA-based approach. Here, we use the
PSICOV (Jones et al., 2012) algorithm to calculate correlated
mutation scores (CMs). The ML-based engine in the proposed
protocol is implemented with an ensemble classiﬁer. It is the
fusion of five OET-KNN (Zouhal and Denoeux, 1998) classiﬁers
and five SVM classiﬁers, where each independent classiﬁer is
trained with a different training set obtained from five independ-
ent under-samplings. By doing so, we can get the diversities from
different algorithms and, at the same time, reduce the informa-
tion loss Via multiple samplings.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Data sets

For fair comparison, we used the same two benchmark data sets from
previous studies. The training data set was taken from TMHcon (Fuchs
et al., 2009) consisting of 62 alpha-helical transmembrane (TMH) pro-
teins. Here, we only used 60 of these proteins and discarded 117VA and
lvaB because of either non-standard atomic coordinate records or too
few positive contacts, as deﬁned in the next section. All the 60 proteins
have at least three TMHs with the pairwise sequence identity <40%
among the training data set. TMH locations and their topologies were
extracted from the databases of TOPDB (Tusnady et al., 2008), PDBTM
(Tusnady et al., 2005) and 0PM (Lomize et al., 2006). For extra valid-
ation, an independent data set was taken from TMhhcp (Wang et al.,
2011), which contains 21 TMH proteins with the pairwise sequence iden-
tity <40% in itself and to the training data set.

2.2 Contact deﬁnition and evaluation criteria

We adopted the contact deﬁnition from TMHcon (Fuchs et al., 2009),
MEMPACK (Nugent and Jones, 2010) and TMhhcp (Wang et al., 2011)
for the convenience of direct comparisons with these methods. Brieﬂy,
two residues from different TMHs are considered to be in contact if the
minimal distance of their side chain or backbone heavy atoms is <S.SA.

In this work, we evaluated our method using a leave-one-out jackknife
cross-validation, which is the same as previous studies. It takes one protein
sequence out for testing, while keeping the remaining protein sequences for
training. This procedure will be terminated when all the proteins have been
tested individually. The overall prediction performance was evaluated by
averaging the performances on individual proteins. We also assessed our

method using a 4-fold cross-validation, where the four equal-size subsets
have roughly the same number distribution of TMHs. Additionally, we
used an independent data set for further validation. In this case, the ﬁnal
model was trained based on the whole training data set.

For inter-TMH residue contact prediction, the top L/S-predicted con-
tacts were selected for assessing the prediction performance and then used
to determine TMHiTMH interactions, which is the same as previous
reports (Fuchs et al., 2009). Here, L is the length of the concatenate
TMHs. Concretely, three measures are used to evaluate the performance,
i.e. Accuracy, Coverage and Accuracy (8 = 4). Accuracy is deﬁned as the
fraction of correctly predicted contacts with respect to all the predicted
contacts. Coverage is deﬁned as the percentage of correctly predicted
contacts from the total observed contacts. Accuracy (8:4) is derived
from 8-ana1ysis (Ortiz et al., 1999), which calculates the fraction of pre-
dicted contacts lying within one helix turn (four residues each side)
around the observed contacts.

For TMHiTMH interaction prediction, interacting helix pairs were
derived from the top L/S-predicted contacts. As deﬁned in previous stu-
dies, a helix pair is considered to be interacting if it contains at least one
contact. Applying this deﬁnition to the training/independent data set, we
obtained 681 /334 interacting helix pairs and 757/347 non-interacting helix
pairs, respectively, where the ratios between interacting and non-interact-
ing samples are similar to previous reports (Nugent and Jones, 2010).
Based on the observed interactions, the performance of predicting
TMHiTMH interactions can then be assessed. Four measures are used
to evaluate the performance, i.e. Accuracy, Sensitivity, Speciﬁcity and
M CC. Here, Accuracy is defined as the fraction of correctly predicted
interactions with respect to all the predicted interactions.

2.3 Feature extraction

We extracted four types of sequence-based features, including position-
speciﬁc scoring matrix (PSSM), residue position, relative position within
TMH and sequence separation between two residues, for model training.
TMH locations and their topologies were extracted from annotated
databases. Details for each type of input features are described in the
following text:

2.3.] Position-speciﬁc scoring matrix The PSSM of each protein
was generated by using PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) program
to search against the UniRef90 database with three iterations and an
E-value threshold of 0.001. PSSM can be represented by an L by
20 matrix, where L is the protein length. To consider neighboring resi-
dues, a sliding window centered on a target residue, with four residues
on each side of that residue, was used to extract a ISO-dimensional feature
vector. The original score in each position was normalized by the follow-
ing logistic function of Equation (1) (Fuchs et al., 2009):

ﬁx): 1

7 1
1 + e” ( )
where x is the original score.
2.3.2 Residue position A 10-dimensional binary vector is used to
encode the residue position along the TMH to reﬂect the contact site.
The ﬁrst seven vector elements correspond to seven equally split parts
along the TMH. These elements were set to 0, other than the element at
index calculated by Equation (2) deﬁned as follows:

. p — 1

index_f(7sT)+l (2)
where N denotes the length of the TMH containing the target residue,
and [7 denotes the position of the target residue between 1 and N on the
TMH. Here, the function f returns the ﬂoor value. The vector element at
index was set to 1 if the target residue is in the index-th part of the helix.
The last three vector elements indicate which side of the TMH the residue
lies on. We divided each TMH into three parts to encode whether the

residue lies closest to the cytoplasmic side ([1 0 0]), helix core ([0 1 0]) or
extracellular side ([0 0 1]). One-quarter of the TMH consists of the cyto-
plasmic side, another quarter the extracellular side and the remaining the
helix core.

2.3.3 Residue relative position Residue relative position was calcu-
lated by Equation (3) deﬁned as follows:

f(p)={ %, i=odd }

1—%,i=even

(3)

where N and p are as previously described, and i stands for the i-th
TMH along the protein sequence from N- to C-terminal. Residues with
similar position and relative position may have similar membrane bilayer
depth.

2.3.4 Sequence separation Sequence separation was encoded by a
nine-dimensional binary vector corresponding to the number of residues
between two residues. The bins consist of less than 25, 50, 75, 100, 125,
150, 175, 200 and more than 200 residues. If the separation satisﬁed the
threshold corresponding to the vector element j, then all vector elements
no more than j were set to 1.

2.4 Feature fusion

2.4.1 Serial combination The most straightforward way to combine
the two feature vectors from candidate residue pair is to serially concat-
enate one after the other, as implemented in all the previous studies
(Fuchs et al., 2009; Lo et al., 2009; Nugent and Jones, 2010; Wang
et al., 2011). Suppose that the feature vectors x and y represent residues
i and j, respectively, the serially combined feature vector z is a real vector

deﬁned as follows:
x
= 4
z (y) ( )

2.4.2 Parallel combination The symmetry of feature vectors of the
two residues motivates us to investigate a parallel combination approach
(Yang et al., 2003). Given the two feature vectors x and y described
earlier, the parallelly combined feature vector z is a complex vector in-
stead of the real vector in Equation (4), which is deﬁned as follows:

z=x+i»y (5)

where i represents an imaginary unit.

2.4.3 Feature reduction Many different kinds of feature reduction
algorithms are available, and among them the principle component ana-
lysis (PCA) algorithm is widely used (Fukunaga, 1990). However, for the
parallel combination in complex space [Equation (5)], PCA cannot be
directly used. An extension of PCA called GPCA (generalized principle
component analysis) has been proposed (Yang et al., 2003) for dealing
with the complex vector feature reduction problem. Suppose that the
complex feature vector z lies in a unitary space, let Q be the number of
pattern classes, P(w,-) be the prior probability of pattern class i,
z,- = E{z | m} be the mean feature vector of pattern class i and
z = E{z} = 2?:1P(w,-) > 2,- be the mean vector of all the feature vectors.
The between-class scatter matrix, within-class scatter matrix and total-
scatter matrix are, respectively, deﬁned as follows:

Sb = 2:1 P(wi)(ii - Z)(Zi — Z)” (6)
SW = 2:1 P(wi)E{(z — 2:)(z — 2,)”lwi} (7)
St = S}; + SW = E{(z — Z)(z — 3H} (8)

From Equations (38), it is obvious that Sb, S,,, and S, are all semi-
positive deﬁnite Hermite matrices, so together with the proved theorem
that each eigenvalue of Hermite matrix is a real number (Ding and Cai,

1995), we then can have the following corollary: the eigenvalues of S1,, S,,,
and S, in unitary space are all non-negative real numbers. Based on the
aforementioned corollary, the GPCA thus can be described as follows: Let
v1, v2, . . . , v” be the orthogonal eigenvectors of S,, and A], A2, . . . , A” be the
associated eigenvalues, which satisfy Alzkzz . . . 3A”. By choosing the ﬁrst
m-maximal eigenvectors as projection axes, a given feature vector z can be
projected to an m-dimensional vector g by Equation (9) as follows:

g = 45”z (9)

where 45 2 (v1, v2, . . . , vm). The dimensionality-reduced vector g, rather
than the original combined feature vector z, is then used for classiﬁcation.
Note that the dimensionality-reduced vector g also lies in a unitary space.
When the complex feature space degenerates to a real space, the GPCA is
in fact the classic PCA.

2.5 Prediction model

The developed MemBrain predictor is composed of two engines: CMA-
based and ML-based prediction modules. The ﬂowchart of MemBrain is
shown in Figure 1. The merit of CMA-based engine is that it has a clear
biophysical interpretation, but its performance is highly dependent on the
number of homologous sequences. The ML-based engine is not easily
interpretable, but it handles the small-sample problem better. These
two engines complement each other in inter-TMH residue contact pre-
diction to drive MemBrain as an accurate prediction model.

2.5 .I CMA-based prediction engine Approaches that use CMs to
detect co-evolving residue pairs work commonly through calculating the
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (Gobel et al., 1994; Pollock and Taylor,
1997) or mutual information (Burger and van Nimwegen, 2010; Dunn
et al., 2008) between columns in MSAs. PSICOV (Jones et al., 2012), a
recent approach that is based on mutual information, improved signiﬁ-
cantly the accuracy of contact prediction by using a sparse inverse covari-
ance estimation technique (Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2006) to deal
with indirect coupling effects.

We used PSICOV to calculate CMs, where the residue pairs that lie on
the same TMH were removed. The initial MSAs were collected by using
PSI-BLAST to search against the UniRef90 database with three iter-
ations and an E-value threshold of 0.001. In the ﬁnal alignments, all
columns not belonging to any TMH regions were deleted and duplicate

sequences were also discarded. The output raw scores were scaled to the
range [0, 1] using the standardized function:

93—min

s(x) = (10)

man: — min
where x is the raw score and min and max are minimal and maximal
scores for a given protein.

2.5.2 ML—based prediction engine Applying the contact deﬁnition
described earlier, we obtained 11 526 contact residue pairs (positive sam-
ples) and 532 531 non-contact residue pairs (negative samples). The ratio
between the total contact pairs and all the non-contact pairs is ~1:46,
resulting in the problem of imbalanced learning. In principle, we can
randomly sample a subset from the negative class and incorporate it
with all positive samples to form a relative balanced training set.
However, the information loss induced by random under-sampling will
weaken the prediction performance. In light of this problem, we applied
ensemble learning to reduce the impact of under-sampling.

We randomly sampled ﬁve subsets from the negative class independ-
ently and incorporated each subset with all positive samples to generate
ﬁve different training sets. These ﬁve training sets were used to train five
separate OET-KNN and SVM classifiers. The ratio between the positives
and the sampled negatives is important because it will serve as a base
for the statistical algorithm to learn the distributions of different classes.
According to our experiments, the ratio 1:4 between positive and negative
samples for each protein gives better performance and hence is used
in MemBrain. OET-KNN and SVM classiﬁers were trained with parallel
fused feature sets and serial combined feature sets, respectively, because
our experimental results show that this is a better choice, and meanwhile,
strong diversities can be generated among the component classiﬁers,
which are critical for ensemble learning performance (Zhou and Yu,
2005).

We have trained multiple classiﬁers consisting of five OET-KNN clas-
siﬁers and ﬁve SVM classiﬁers, which were fused together with a linear
combination scheme based on posteriori probabilities. To give a general
deﬁnition, suppose that there exist M1 OET-KNN classiﬁers, M2 SVM
classiﬁers and Q pattern classes, we then deﬁne the linear combination
scheme as follows:

Pk =a>Z:l1w,->P(k|O,-)
M
+(1—a)>Z,:jw,->P(kisj). (k = 1. 2.  Q)

where P(k|O,-) and P(k|S,~) denote the probability of class k by the i-th
OET-KNN classiﬁer and the j-th SVM classiﬁer, respectively; Pk denotes
the fused probability; w,- and w, denote the weights of the i-th OET-KNN
classiﬁer and the j-th SVM classiﬁer, respectively, which are set to the
average value for all members of the same classiﬁer type, i.e. w,= 1 /M1
and w]: 1/M2. The weight a is selected by searching the value from 0 to 1
with a step of 0.01 via a jackknife cross-validation. Obviously here,
M1=M2=5 and Q22. Note that the raw scores generated by each
classiﬁer for a given protein were scaled to the range [0, 1] with
Equation (10) before combination. This ensemble ML predictor is
denoted as OSC (QET-KNN and SVM Classiﬁer).

(11)

2.5.3 Final prediction model The combination of CMA-based
engine PSICOV and ML-based ensemble engine OSC forms the ﬁnal
prediction model, which is implemented in MemBrain. The outputs of
OSC and PSICOV are merged by using a linear combination deﬁned as
follows:

P=,5‘Posc+(1—/5)‘PPSICOV (12)

where POSC and PPSICOV are the predicted contact probabilities gener-
ated by OSC and PSICOV, respectively, and P denotes the ﬁnal contact
propensity. The weight ,8 is selected using the same search strategy as the
weight a.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Benchmark test of CMA-based approach

We applied the CMA-based algorithm PSICOV (Jones et al.,
2012) for inter-TMH residue contact prediction. It was per-
formed on the concatenated sequence, which consists of the
TMH regions. Residue pairs that lie on the same TMH were
removed from the predictions. All the possible residue pairs
were ranked according to the generated CMs. The top ranked
L/5 residue pairs were selected as the predicted contacts, where
L is the total number of residues in the TMHs.

PSICOV calculates CMs from MSAs by PSI-BLAST search
through the UniRef90 database. The quality of MSAs is critic-
ally important for the ﬁnal prediction accuracy. Supplementary
Figure S1 illustrates the average performance of PSICOV on 60
TMH proteins in the training data set. As can be seen, the pre-
diction performance is highly dependent on sufﬁcient homology.
When the number of homologous sequences increases from 250
to 5000, the prediction accuracy improves as well from 21.6 to
42.1%. Although the performance can be improved by including
more homologous sequences, there is a limit. We have tried to
increase this parameter to greater than 5000, but found that the
prediction performance did not change much. For a balance, we
set the parameter of -b to 5000 for PSI-BLAST in the following
experiments. With this parameter, the prediction accuracy is
42.1% on the training data set.

To examine the effects of MSAs’ size on accuracy, we divided
the training data set into ﬁve subsets based on the number of
sequences in MSAs. The performance of residue contact predic-
tion on these five subsets is shown in Supplementary Table S1.
As expected, better performance was achieved for proteins with a
larger set of MSAs (52.8% in Group 5 with more than 5000
aligned sequences), whereas poorer performance for those with
smaller MSAs (12.8% in Group 1 with less than 250 aligned
sequences). In the case of difﬁcult targets that have few homolo-
gous sequences, the prediction of residue contacts is still a chal-
lenge to PSICOV due to the incorrect co-evolution values that
are calculated from small MSAs. For instance, the average ac-
curacy on the five proteins in Group 1 with no more than 250
homologous sequences found is only 12.8%, with a coverage rate
as low as 3.4%. These results demonstrate the weakness of the
CMA-based approach.

3.2 Benchmark test of ML—based engine

We have trained ﬁve OET-KNN classiﬁers (denoted as OETl,
OET2, OET3, OET4 and OET5) (see Supplementary Fig. S2)
and ﬁve SVM classiﬁers (denoted as SVMl, SVM2, SVM3,
SVM4 and SVM5), where each of them was trained with differ-
ent training sets. As shown in Supplementary Table S2, the pre-
diction accuracy of exact contacts by individual OET-KNN
classiﬁers varies from 45.5 to 47.8% and that with a residue
variation within one helix turn (8 = 4) ranges from 78.0 to
78.5%. For individual SVM classiﬁers, the prediction accuracy
varies from 46.9 to 49.0% and that with 8 = 4 ranges from 83.1
to 85.2%. These results indicate that the prediction performance
is unstable with respect to classiﬁcation algorithm and the sam-
pling. When we combined individual OET-KNN classiﬁers with
equal weights, denoted as OETs, the prediction accuracy

High-accuracy prediction of transmembrane inter-helix contacts

 

increased to 48.2%. Similarly, we combined individual SVM
classiﬁers, denoted as SVMs, the prediction accuracy improved
to 50.7%. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3, the areas
under the curve of the combined classiﬁers OETs and SVMs
are 0.805 and 0.841, which are superior to those of the individual
OET-KNN and SVM classiﬁers, respectively.

Both of the improvements by OETs and SVMs demonstrate
that fusing multiple classiﬁers is an effective way to reduce the
information loss in the under-sampling process. Thus, we con-
structed an ensemble predictor called OSC by combining OETs
and SVMs to make full use of diversities from multiple training
subsets and classiﬁcation algorithms according to Equation (11).
Supplementary Figure S4A illustrates the results.

The combination of OETs and SVMs indeed performs better
on small weights as expected because SVMs performs better than
OETs. At first as the weight or increases, the prediction perform-
ance improves, and then it degrades to the performance of OETs.
When or increases to the value 0.24, the highest prediction accur-
acy of 52.8% is obtained, which is then adopted in the ensemble
classiﬁer. As shown in Supplementary Table S2, OSC performs
better than both OETs and SVMs on all the three measures. The
prediction accuracy of OSC is 4.6% higher than OETs and 2.1%
higher than SVMs. The area under the curve of OSC is 0.846,
which is higher than 0.805 of OETs and 0.841 of SVMs
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The good performance of OSC is due
to the complementation of individual classiﬁers.

3.3 Merging CMA-based approach with ML—based engine

As the predicted CMs indicate the potential of residue pairs to
form contacts, this information can be used not only as features
but also as decisions. In Supplementary Table S3, we show that
decision-level fusion (regarding CMs as independent prediction)
discussed in this article outperforms feature-level fusion (regard-
ing CMs as an additional feature fed into the ML model) applied
in existing methods in both cases of OET-KNN and SVM. For
instance, in the case of OET-KNN, feature-level fusion does not
help to improve the performance, whereas decision level fusion
improves the accuracy from 47.8 to 57.0%. Thus, we constructed
a consensus predictor to further improve the prediction perform-
ance by merging the outputs of ensemble classiﬁer OSC and
PSICOV (Jones et al., 2012), which is implemented as
MemBrain according to Equation (12). As shown in
Supplementary Figure S4B, the highest prediction accuracy was
obtained when the weight )3 is 0.56. The prediction accuracy of the
consensus predictor is 62.0%, as listed in Supplementary Table S2.

The combination of OSC and PSICOV signiﬁcantly improves
the prediction performance in terms of all the three measures. The
complementation contributes 9.2% prediction accuracy and 5.1%
accuracy (8 = 4) to OSC. The consensus predictor achieves 19.9%
higher prediction accuracy than PSICOV alone. We also analyzed
statistical signiﬁcance of the differences of the three criteria
between MemBrain and OSC/PSICOV using a paired t-test. If
the resulting P—Value is below a level (e. g. 0.05), the performance
difference between two methods is considered to be statistically
significant. The resulting p—Values in terms of accuracy, coverage
and accuracy (8:4) are 1.2e-4/4.2e-7, 3.4e-3/2.6e-6 and 6.5e-3/
1.7e-7, respectively. These results indicate that MemBrain is stat-
istically better than the other two independent engines.

Fig. 2. Performance improvement on ﬁve groups by combining OSC to
PSICOV

Supplementary Table S1 also shows the performance of
MemBrain on ﬁve groups of proteins according to MSAs’ size.
Comparing with PSICOV, we ﬁnd that accuracies in all the ﬁve
groups are improved (see Fig. 2). The largest improvement occurs
in Group 2, where the accuracy is increased from 28.0 (PSICOV)
to 73.5% (MemBrain). For the very difﬁcult targets in Group 1,
the accuracy is increased from 12.8 to 23.6%. These results show
that the combination of OSC and PSICOV is helpful for fusing the
merits of both ML—based and CMA-based methods to enhance
the prediction accuracy. Supplementary Figure S5 elucidates how
OSC and PSICOV complement each other by taking two TMH
proteins lbccC and 2nr9A as instances.

3.4 Performance comparison of residue contact prediction
with existing methods

In this section, we compared our predictor MemBrain with exist-
ing methods on both training and independent data sets, includ-
ing three inter-TMH residue contact predictors [TMHcon (Fuchs
et al., 2009), MEMPACK (Nugent and Jones, 2010) and
TMhhcp (Wang et al., 2011)] and two globular protein residue
contact predictors [SVMcon (Cheng and Baldi, 2007) and
SVMSEQ (Wu and Zhang, 2008)]. On the training data set,
the compared predictors for TMH proteins are evaluated on
the same data set with jackknife cross-validation. On the inde-
pendent data set, experimental results of TMHcon and
MEMPACK were taken from TMhhcp. PSICOV (Jones et al.,
2012) is also included for comparison. TMhhcp reported two
types of results based on all the features and the selected features
(denoted as TMhhcpl and TMhhcp2), we list both of them for
comparison. For globular protein contact predictors, we only
ranked the residue pairs that lie on different TMHs.

As shown in Table 1, MemBrain performs substantially better
than other methods, with a prediction accuracy of 62.0% /64.1%
on the training/independent data set. Note that MEMPACK se-
lected the predicted contacts based on scores generated by the
SVM predictor rather than the top L/5 predictions, and the cover-
age is the fraction of the total correctly predicted contacts from all

the observed contacts and hence is larger than the methods based
on the top L/5 predictions. Taking the best existing method
TMhhcp for comparison, MemBrain achieves 12.5%/16.0%
and 16.2%/ 15.5% higher prediction accuracy than TMhhcpl
and TMhhcp2, respectively, on the training/independent data
set, and the corresponding prediction accuracy (8 :4) is 6.5%/
5.2% and 6.6%/7.8% higher. It is noteworthy that globular pro-
tein contact predictors SVMcon and SVEMSEQ perform poorly
when applied to TMH proteins. We also conducted the paired
t—test to compare the statistical significance between MemBrain
and SVMcon/SVMSEQ on the training data set. The resulting
p—Values in terms of accuracy, coverage and accuracy (8 = 4) are
1.9e-21/2.5e-19, 1.1e-17/4.9e-15 and 1.9e-12/1.8e-11, respectively.
These results suggest that predictors designed for globular pro-
teins are not suitable for predicting inter-TMH residue contacts.
The reason can be the very different cellular environments of
residues in and out of the membrane, and hence the features
are also different. In addition, we also assessed our method
using a 4-fold cross-validation and obtained comparable results
with that of jackknife cross-validation. Supplementary Table S4
shows the performance on more non-redundant data sets.

Interestingly, PSICOV performs better on the independent
data set than the training data set, as shown in Table 1, where
the prediction accuracy is improved from 42.1 to 50.9%. We
found that 26 of 60 proteins from the training data set contained
less than 1000 aligned sequences in MSAs, whereas for the inde-
pendent data set, the ratio is 3 of 21. In addition, 10 proteins in
the training data set contained less than 500 aligned sequences,
whereas all the proteins in the independent data set contained
more than 500 aligned sequences. The results demonstrate that
the performance of PSICOV is highly dependent on sufﬁcient
homology.

3.5 Performance comparison of TMH—TMH interaction
prediction with existing methods

One important use of the predicted contacts is to identify inter-
acting TMHs. Using the observed interactions described previ-
ously, the performance of TMHiTMH interaction prediction
can be assessed. The performance comparison with existing
methods is shown in Supplementary Table S5. MemBrain
achieves 90.1%/ 87.9% prediction accuracy and an MCC of
0555/0526 on the training/independent data set, which performs
better than the existing methods. As TMH interaction prediction
is derived from the predicted contacts, globular protein contact
predictors perform poorly on inter-TMH residue contact predic-
tion and thus are not as good as the TMH protein contact pre-
dictors for TMHiTMH interaction prediction. Also, as can
be seen from Supplementary Figure S5, the predicted contacts
obtained by PSICOV (Jones et al., 2012) are widespread. In other
words, it predicted more interacting TMH pairs with higher sen-
sitivity. Meanwhile, it predicted more spurious interacting TMH
pairs as well with lower accuracy, which resulted in a relative
lower MCC compared with MemBrain.

3.6 Benchmark test on MemBrain-guided GPCR
structure modeling

To have a direct examination of the impact of the MemBrain
contact predictions on three-dimensional (3D) GPCR modeling,
we collected all 13 GPCR proteins with known structure in the
PDB library (PDBID: 1u19A, 2rh1A, 2y00A, 2z73A, 3em1A,
3oduA, 3pb1A, 3rzeA, 3vw7A, 4dajA, 4djhA, 4ea3A, 4ngA,
see Table 2). We then generate GPCR models by I-TASSER
(Roy et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2011) with MemBrain contacts and
also models without using MemBrain contacts.

Although MemBrain contact predictions are only on the Ca
atoms, we found that the best GPCR models can be generated
when the same contact restraints are extended for all Ca, Ca and
side-chain center of mass in the I-TASSER simulations. Table 2
summarized the results of I-TASSER with and without using
MemBrain contacts, where all GPCR templates and the hom-
ologous templates with a sequence identity >30% or detectable
by PSI-BLAST are excluded. First, although no GPCR tem-
plates were used, the inherent I-TASSER fragment assembly
simulation was able to assemble structures with an approxi-
mately correct TMH arrangement (TM-score >0.5) in 7 of 13
cases; in 5 cases, the models have a TM-score >0.6. The average
TM-score and RMSD to the X-ray structure are 0.465 and
10.9 A, respectively, in the TMH regions.

The average accuracy of the MemBrain contact predictions is
0.57 for the top L/5 predictions, whereas I-TASSER uses the top
L contacts, which have an average accuracy of 0.35. As shown in
Table 2, the incorporation of MemBrain contacts has signiﬁ-
cantly improved the quality of the GPCR models. For example,
the number of cases with a TM-score >0.6 increases from 5 to 10
and the average TM-score increases by 37%. This TM-score
improvement on GPCRs by MemBrain contacts is dramatically
higher than that observed on the globular proteins by SVMSEQ
(Wu and Zhang, 2008) contacts for the I-TASSER models,
which have a TM-score increase by 4.6% (Wu et al., 2011).
The major reason for the difference is the higher accuracy
of the long-range contacts by MemBrain, which have been

speciﬁcally trained for TMHs. If we apply SVMSEQ on the 13
GPCRs, the average accuracy of contacts is only 0.16 for top L/5
or 0.09 for top L predictions (not to mention that many of the
SVMSEQ predictions are short-range contacts, which are less
useful for protein 3D constructions).

As expected, there is an obvious correlation between the TM-
score improvement and the accuracy of the MemBrain contacts.
For the targets with the most signiﬁcant improvement (e.g.
2z73A and 3rzeA), the accuracy of MemBrain for the top L
contacts is 46 and 31%, respectively. For targets of relatively
lower accuracy (3em1A with a contact accuracy 25%), the TM-
score of the I-TASSER models is slightly improved but still in
the unfoldable region (TM-score=0.315). There are some tar-
gets, e.g. 4djhA, where the MemBrain contact accuracy is high
(0.57 for L/5 and 0.37 for L), but the TM-score improvement
(12%) is lower than average because a high proportion of
MemBrain contacts (78%) are already included in the I-
TASSER models. Nevertheless, the remaining 22% of the
novel contacts from MemBrain serve to refine the models.

In Figure 3, we present the superposition of MemBrain-guided
I-TASSER models and X-ray structures for all 13 GPCRs. Most
of the I-TASSER models indeed show a similar topology of TMH
packing to the targets. However, there are a few targets (e.g.
2z73A, 3pblA and 4djhA) where the I-TASSER models have
the TMH structure bended away from the axis at the middle of
the helices. This is due to the fact that the I-TASSER simulations
were fully automated and no TMH requirements were imple-
mented. Thus, the bended helices from non-homologous

templates resulted in the helix bending. If TMH predictions
from MEMSTAT (Jones et al., 1994) were used, the TMH bend-
ing could be eliminated but the overall TM-score was not obvi-
ously improved (data not shown).

Although the MemBrain contacts are only in the TMH regions,
the overall I-TASSER models along the entire chain are also im-
proved. As shown in Supplementary Table S6 and Supplementary
Figure S6, the average TM-score of the whole-chain models is
increased by 35% and RMSD reduced by 2.6A. The number of
targets with a correct fold (TM-score >0.5) increases from 5 to 10,
when the MemBrain contact predictions are used. It is worth
mentioning that all GPCR templates and homologous templates
with sequence identity >30% were both excluded in aforemen-
tioned I-TASSER simulations. If we only excluded the homolo-
gous templates with sequence identity >30% in I-TASSER
simulations, in which case some GPCR templates can be kept,
then the ﬁnal average RMSD is as low as 1.8A with a TM-score
0.902, as demonstrated in Supplementary Table S7.

3.7 Case studies

The usefulness of MemBrain contact predictions has been demon-
strated in the case of GPCR 3D structure modeling. To further
demonstrate the effectiveness of MemBrain contact predictions
for other TMH proteins besides GPCRs, we performed structure
prediction for two newly solved membrane protein structures, i.e.
heterodimeric ABC transporter (3qf4A) (Hohl et al., 2012) and
channelrhodopsin (ChR) chimera between Cth and ChR2

(3ug9A) (Kato et al., 2012). The pairwise sequence identities of
the two proteins to the training data set are <30%. Using
MemBrain, 64.5 and 80.7% of the predicted top L/5 contacts
are native contacts for the two proteins, respectively. Their cor-
responding accuracies derived from 8-ana1ysis (8:4) are both
100%. These results are shown in Supplementary Figure S7.

Similar to the GPCR benchmark, homologous templates were
removed. We ﬁrst tried removing templates that have sequence
identity >30%. In both proteins when contact predictions were
not used, the RMSD in the TMH region was 4.3 and 3.0A for
3qf4A and 3ug9A, respectively. The results are given in Table 3.
For both proteins, the accuracy without predicted contacts is
already high. Although MemBrain predictions are good relative
to current contact prediction methods, the probability of improv-
ing these structures further with predicted contacts is small, and
the structures may even be made slightly worst. This was indeed
the case for both proteins (Table 3), where no improvement
occurred. Nevertheless, contact prediction can improve struc-
tures of mediocre quality, so we also tried removing templates
that have sequence identity >15% to generate these structures for
improvement.

For 3qf4A, in the 15% sequence identity case, the resulting
model without MemBrain contacts remained similar at 4.2A in
the TMH region, but the RMSD of the entire chain increased
signiﬁcantly by >19.0A relative to the 30% case. With
MemBrain contacts, the RMSD in the TMH region also re-
mained similar at 4.2A, and the whole-chain RMSD increased
by 17.0A. Although the predicted contacts did not have much
effect on the ﬁrst model, the contacts did reduce the number of
poorly predicted structures among the top 10 models. Without the
predicted contacts, the two worst models were 9.9 and 20.4A;
whereas with the contacts, the worst model was 5.5A, which
makes the signiﬁcant improvement in the top 10 models in
terms of both the average RMSD and TM-score (Table 3). It is

worth pointing out that 3qf4A is an especially challenging case
because it is a dimer, and the helices that span the membrane also
protrude significantly outside the membrane to form an intracel-
lular domain. In addition to inter-chain contacts, inter-helix con-
tacts were not predicted for the residues outside the membrane,
which limited the accuracy of helix placement and reduced the
impact of MemBrain contact predictions.

For 3ug9A, in the 15% sequence identity case, the result was
5.6 and 4.2A in the TMH region, respectively, for the case with-
out and with MemBrain-predicted contacts. As to the top 10
models, the MemBrain-predicted contacts are found also helpful
by improving the average RMSD from 10.9 to 5.3 A, with TM-
score improved from 0.369 to 0.6.

To challenge MemBrain further, templates with TM-score
>05 to the X-ray structure were removed to increase the depend-
ence on the predicted contacts rather than on the templates for
protein folding. In this case, the improvement was signiﬁcant for
3ug9A, where the change was from 15.0 to 6.9A in the TMH
region. We tried the same >0.5 cutoff for 3qf4A, but the result
was >16A in the TMH region for both cases because of the lack
of inter-helical contact information in the intracellular domain.

4 DISCUSSION

Our results demonstrate that the weakness of CMA (sufﬁcient
homology) can be compensated for by combining it with ML
methods, and the weakness of statistical ML (local condensed
predictions) can also be complemented by combining with
CMA-based approaches. It would be interesting to investigate
whether the idea of combining ML-based methods with CMA-
based approaches in MemBrain can also be used to enhance the
contact prediction accuracy in globular proteins. To demonstrate
this, we used PSI-BLAST to search against UniRef90 database
for the 22 targets containing free modeling or free modeling/tem-
plate-based modeling domains in CASP9. Supplementary Figure
S8 shows the distributions of the number of homologous se-
quences on the CASP9 targets.

The results in Supplementary Figure S8 demonstrate: (i)
Although some targets have very few or no homologous structures
in the PDB, which causes difﬁculties for homology structure mod-
eling, they have a large number of homologous sequences avail-
able. For example, four of these targets have more than 1000
homologous sequences in the UniRef90 database. This means
we can get reliable predicted contacts for these four proteins
(~61% average accuracy for top L/5 predictions on the training
data set). (ii) In the other 18 targets, 9 of them contain less than
250 homologous sequences. According to our results, the accuracy
of PSICOV in this group was very low (12.8% in this work), and
the combination of ML—based method with PSICOV is expected
to improve the accuracy (23.6% in this work). Furthermore, there
are six proteins in the homology size region of (250 500). When
directly applying PSICOV on this group, the results are also not
satisfactory (28.0% in this work). However, the MemBrain pre-
diction significantly improves the results in this group (73.5% in
this work).

To further illustrate the potential merit of the combination of
ML-based methods with CMA-based approaches on globular
proteins, we replaced the ML-part of the MemBrain predictor
with SVMSEQ. The predictions of SVMSEQ for the 22 targets

were extracted from http://www.predictioncenter.org/download_
area/CASP9/predictions/, which were merged with PSICOV out-
puts using a linear combination strategy. Supplementary Table
S8 lists the detailed performance of top L/5 predictions for each
range contact on the 22 targets. As can be seen, the performance
improved as expected. From the results, it is very interesting to
see the following: SVMSEQ performs better than PSICOV on
the short-range contacts (33.6% versus 12.8%), and worse than
PSICOV on the long-rang contacts (17.1% versus 20.3%). This
is consistent with our previous observation that the ML-based
approach gives more local condensed predictions. The results
also show that SVMSEQ and PSICOV predictions are largely
complementary on long-range contacts, which makes the com-
bination of them more accurate. These results suggest that a
proper consensus of CMA-based approaches with ML-based
methods is also promising for enhancing the ab initio contact
predictions in globular proteins.

Besides inter-TMH residue contacts in TMHs (denoted as
Type 1), there exist two other contact types in TMH proteins:
contacts where one residue is in the membrane region and the
other residue in the water-soluble loop region (denoted as Type
2), and contacts where both residues are in the water soluble
region (denoted as Type 3). These two types of contacts are also
important for 3D structure prediction, especially for the loop
region. By observing the native contacts from known structures
in the training and the independent data set at the whole-chain
level, we found that 48.0 and 45.9% are Type 3 contacts, and 14.1
and 14.8% are Type 2 contacts. Hence, predicting these two types
of contacts will be important future work. In this case, the pre-
dictors developed for predicting residue contacts in globular pro-
teins are expected to contribute.

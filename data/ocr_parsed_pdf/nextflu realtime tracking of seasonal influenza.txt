Abstract

Summary: Seasonal influenza viruses evolve rapidly, allowing them to evade immunity in their
human hosts and reinfect previously infected individuals. Similarly, vaccines against seasonal in—
fluenza need to be updated frequently to protect against an evolving virus population. We have
thus developed a processing pipeline and browser—based visualization that allows convenient
exploration and analysis of the most recent influenza virus sequence data. This web—application
displays a phylogenetic tree that can be decorated with additional information such as the viral
genotype at specific sites, sampling location and derived statistics that have been shown to be
predictive of future virus dynamics. In addition, mutation, genotype and clade frequency

trajectories are calculated and displayed.

1. Introduction

Every year, seasonal inﬂuenza infects between 10 and 20% of the glo—
bal population, resulting in substantial human morbidity and mortal—
ity (World Health Organization, 2009). Vaccination remains the most
effective public health measure to combat seasonal epidemics.
However, inﬂuenza viruses constantly evolve and thereby undergo
antigenic drift, allowing drifted viruses to reinfect individuals with
acquired immunity to previously circulating strains. Owing to anti—
genic drift, the seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine needs frequent updating to
remain effective. In any given year, the particular choice of vaccine
strain plays a major role in determining vaccine efficacy and so it is of
critical importance to develop tools to analyze the ongoing evolution
of the inﬂuenza virus population in order to aid vaccine strain selec—
tion. The program nextﬂu presents a near real—time display of genetic
relationships among inﬂuenza viruses and allows investigation of cur—
rently available sequence data. By visualizing many different genetic
and epidemiological features, we hope that nextﬂu will help vaccine
strain selection. Currently, nextﬂu tracks all four circulating lineages
of seasonal inﬂuenza: A/H3N2, A/HlNlpdm, B/Victoria and B/
Yamagata.

In implementation, nextﬂu consists of a processing pipeline writ—
ten in Python called augur that analyzes virus sequence data and a
JavaScript—based browser visualization called auspice that displays
this processed information. As input, augur requires a FASTA file of
sequences with header labels containing relevant information such
as strain name, sampling date and passage history. For this purpose,
inﬂuenza sequence data for the hemagglutinin (HA) gene is down—
loaded from the GISAID EpiFlu database (Bogner et (11., 2006 ),
which contains the most up—to—date collection of seasonal inﬂuenza
viruses. The first step in the processing pipeline is to automatically
select a subset of representative viruses. Here, viruses without com—
plete date or geographic information, viruses passaged in eggs and
sequences <987 bases are removed. In addition, local outbreaks are
filtered by keeping only one instance of identical sequences sampled
at the same location on the same day. Following filtering, viruses are
subsampled to achieve a more equitable temporal and geographic
distribution. For our standard display period of 3 years and 32
viruses per month, this typically results in ~1200 viruses, for which
we align full—length HA sequences where available and partial se—
quences otherwise, using MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013). Once
aligned, the set of virus sequences is further cleaned by removing

insertions relative to the outgroup to enforce canonical HA site
numbering, by removing sequences that show either too much or
too little divergence relative to the expectation given sampling date,
and by removing known reassortant clusters, such as the triple—reas—
sortant swine inﬂuenza viruses that have sporadically circulating
since 2009 (Bastien et al., 2010). As outgroup for each viral lineage,
we chose a well characterized virus without insertions relative to the
canonical amino—acid numbering and a sampling date a few years
before the time interval of interest.

From the filtered and cleaned alignment, augur builds a phylo—
genetic tree using FastTree (Price et al., 2009), which is then further
refined using RAxML (Stamatakis, 2014). Next, the state of every
internal node of the tree is inferred using a marginal maximum like—
lihood method and missing sequence data at phylogeny tips is filled
with the nearest ancestral sequence at these sites. Internal branches
without mutations are collapsed into polytomies. The final tree is
decorated with the attributes to be displayed in the browser.

In addition to the phylogenetic tree, augur estimates the fre—
quency trajectories of mutations, genotypes and clades in the tree.
Frequencies are determined by maximizing the likelihood of sam—
pling the observed set of virus sequences. In addition, we impose a
smoothing that penalized rapid changes in frequency of the fre—
quency derivative. augur estimates frequency with up to 1—month
resolution. The result is similar to ‘allele dynamics’ plots in
Steinbriick and McHardy (2011), but provides frequencies of clades
in the tree in addition to point mutations. The augur pipeline is run
every 3—7 days in response to sequence updates in the GISAID
database.

At the end of the augur pipeline, JSON files are exported con—
taining the annotated phylogenetic tree, sequence data and fre—
quency trajectories. These JSON files are then visualized by auspice
using D3 (Bostock et al., 2011) and a phylogenetic tree is displayed
with branches scaled according to evolutionary distance across all
sites (Fig. 1). The user can explore the data interactively by selecting
viruses from different dates or by coloring the tree by attributes such
as:

' epitope mutations at sites generally associated with antibody
binding that have been suggested to be predictive of future clade
success (Izuksza and Lassig, 2014),

Fig. 2. The frequency diagram allows geography-specific plotting of frequen-
cies of individual mutations, pairs of mutations and clades in the tree

' receptor binding mutations at seven positions close to the recep—
tor binding site that have been shown to be responsible for major
antigenic transitions in the past decades (Koel et al., 2013),

' local branching index indicating the exponentially weighted tree
length surrounding a node, which is associated with rapid
branching and expansion of clades (Neher et al., 2014),

' HA genotype, which directly colors the tree by genotype at spe—
ciﬁc amino acid positions.

The display can also be restricted to different geographic
regions.

The frequency plot below the tree (Fig. 2) displays the frequency
trajectory of clades in the tree whenever the mouse hovers above the
branch defining the clade. Furthermore, trajectories of individual
mutations, combinations of two mutations and predefined clades
such as 3c3.a can be plotted. A second plot shows the variability of
the alignment. On mouse—click on a variable position in this plot,
auspice will color the tree by amino—acid at this position and plot its
mutation frequencies.

We built nextflu to facilitate the analysis and exploration of sea—
sonal inﬂuenza sequence data collected by laboratories around the
world. By using the most recent data and integrating phylogenies
with frequency trajectories and predictors of successful clades, we
hope that nextflu can inform the choice of strains used in seasonal
inﬂuenza vaccines. nextﬂu was designed to be readily adapted to
other rapidly evolving viruses and we see significant room for future
developments in this area.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The usage of current sequence search tools becomes
increasingly slower as databases of protein sequences continue to
grow exponentially. Tachyon, a new algorithm that identifies closely
related protein sequences ~200 times faster than standard BLAST,
circumvents this limitation with a reduced database and oligopeptide
matching heuristic.

Availability and implementation: The tool is publicly accessible
as a webserver at http://tachyon.bii.a-star.edu.sg and can also be
accessed programmatically through SOAP.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
the Bioinformatics online.

1 ALGORITHM AND WEB SERVER

The continuous exponential growth of sequence databases creates
new challenges for bioinformatics tools where a simple BLAST
search (Altschul et (11., 1997) of one protein against NCBI’s NR
(Sayers et (11., 2011) taking minutes can become too long to be
practical. Careful study of the features and natural sampling of
sequence space allows further optimization of peptide-indexing
based look-up methods as oligopeptides reaching a database-speciﬁc
critical length can become characteristic for a protein and its family
of related sequences (see Supplementary Material).

We have developed Tachyon, a peptide-indexing based look-
up method that identiﬁes sequences similar to a user-deﬁned
query protein at unprecedented speeds and look-up times of a
few hundred milliseconds, rather than minutes on a single dual-
Core processor. Fast peptide-indexing is not new but is in fact
the underlying basis of commonly used methods such as BLAST
(Altschul et (11., 1997), BLAT (Kent, 2002), etc. However, Tachyon
achieves a substantial speed advantage by reducing the searched
sequence space as a result of associating each entry in the
database (e.g. NR) only with representative oligopeptides which

are deﬁned as the most frequent peptides of a deﬁned length
within the indexed database, excluding low-complexity regions
[SEG 12 2.2 2.5 settings (Wootton and Federhen, 1996)]. Through
extensive empirical testing of different parameters including peptide
length, we have found that representing database entries by using
ﬁve pentapeptides was a good compromise between search space
reduction (speed) and correct sequence retrieval (sensitivity) for the
large NCBI NR database. Database hits sharing a speciﬁed number
of pentapeptides (default: 3 out of the 5 indexed peptides) with the
query are then subjected to a more detailed search over the ﬁill
length sequences to evaluate the signiﬁcance of each hit. For this
second step, Tachyon uses an internal default algorithm based on a
quick pairwise L-mer overlap score (e.g. for L = 5, the number of
pentapeptides shared between query and subject sequences over the
total number of pentapeptides present in both sequences). The user
has the additional option of running classical methods such as BLAT
(Kent, 2002), FASTA and SSEARCH (Pearson, 2000) instead. The
basic algorithm steps are illustrated in Figure l.

The fastest implementation of this algorithm is achieved on
hardware where the indexed database can be kept in the working
memory (e.g. 2 GB for the reduced index and 20 GB for the ﬁill
length sequences considering the current NR). To relieve users
from special hardware requirements and the burden of constantly
updating and indexing the huge NCBI NR database, we make
Tachyon searches against NR available as a web service (database
updated monthly) at the URL: http://tachyon.bii.a—star.edu.sg. Users
can paste single sequences or small sets as well as upload FASTA-
formatted ﬁles. The web interface shows hit sequences with
associated scores/E-values and includes an optional hit alignment
using MAFFT (Katoh et (11., 2005) with subsequent display in
Jalview (Waterhouse et (11., 2009). Additional links to the FASTA
sequence of hits and other databases such as GenBank, BLink,
NCBI Taxonomy, PDB UniProt, as well as to ANNIE, an integrated
sequence annotation suite (Ooi et (11., 2009), are provided. Different
ﬁlters, such as limiting the display of the results to speciﬁc source
databases (PDB, RefSeq and SwissProt/UniProtKB), to a number of
sequences or by using keywords are available on-line. Tachyon is
also accessible programmatically through SOAP and permanently
connected to a compute cluster, which, together with a length-based

Fig. 1. Algorithm scheme and speed versus sensitivity benchmark. The searched sequence space is reduced by associating each entry in the database with
only ﬁve representative pentapeptides (red rectangles. top right side). Database hits sharing at least a deﬁned number of pentapeptides with the query (green
rectangles in Step 1. left side) are then subjected to a more detailed search over the full length sequences to evaluate the signiﬁcance of each hit (Step 2.
bottom left side) for which multiple classical methods to choose from are implemented in the Tachyon Web Service. A benchmark for assessing the speed
versus sensitivity proﬁle of key methods (summary of results in plot in bottom right side) is described in detail in the Supplementary Material

load-balancing algorithm makes it possible to match large protein
sets at high speeds. For example, searching the whole human
proteome including isoforms (IPI, v3.78 and 86 702 entries) against
NR on 30 Dual-Core AMD Opteron 2220 processors took only
13 min. Results obtained using SOAP can be either zipped FASTA
sequences of the hits or, fastest, only the accession numbers of the
best hits, which allows quick cross-connection of a query sequence
to popular databases and other SOAP services.

2 BENCHMARK AND DISCUSSION

We benchmarked Tachyon against key methods with searches
of 500 representative human proteins against NR and Figure 1
shows the Clearly unique application spectrum arising from the
speed versus sensitivity proﬁle (detailed benchmark information in
Supplementary Material). For example, at default settings, Tachyon
is ~200>< faster than BLASTP+ but ﬁnds ~14>< less hits when
searching NR. Similarly, it is ~120>< faster than the recently
developed fast method RAPSearch2 (Zhao et (11., 2012) while ﬁnding
~11 >< less hits. In absolute numbers, each Tachyon search took on
average ~0.6 s and returned ~260 hits with the last signiﬁcant hit
having on average 74% identity to the query.

The considerable gain of speed despite the loss of sensitivity
has many practical applications where BLAST searches would take
too long or the usual sensitivity of BLAST may not be needed.
These scenarios include commonly needed tasks like accession-
independent linking up of a sequence to its most closely related
entries in well curated databases such as GenBank (Benson et (11.,
201 1), UniProt [(The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) in 2010,
2010] or diverse pathway and interaction databases. Our approach
of fast sequence matching can also be used to rapidly connect
any sequence to precalculated BLAST search results such as in
BLink (Sayers et (11., 2011). Therefore, to allow sequence similarity

searches with Tachyon-speed and BLAST-sensitivity, users can
simply click in one step from the best Tachyon-hit against NR to the
respective BLink entry with the corresponding ﬁill BLAST result.
Additional links are available to GenBank, PDB, UniProt and to the
ANNIE sequence annotation web tool.

In summary, we developed Tachyon to very quickly connect a
query protein sequence to highly similar sequences and selected
associated resources. It is available as a SOAP service and on-line
at http://tachyon.bii.a-star.edu.sg.

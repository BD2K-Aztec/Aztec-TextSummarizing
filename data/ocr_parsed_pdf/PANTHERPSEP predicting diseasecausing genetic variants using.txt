Abstract

Summary: PANTHER—PSEP is a new software tool for predicting non—synonymous genetic variants
that may play a causal role in human disease. Several previous variant pathogenicity prediction
methods have been proposed that quantify evolutionary conservation among homologous pro—
teins from different organisms. PANTHER—PSEP employs a related but distinct metric based on
'evolutionary preservation’: homologous proteins are used to reconstruct the likely sequences of
ancestral proteins at nodes in a phylogenetic tree, and the history of each amino acid can be traced
back in time from its current state to estimate how long that state has been preserved in its ances—
tors. Here, we describe the PSEP tool, and assess its performance on standard benchmarks for dis—
tinguishing disease—associated from neutral variation in humans. On these benchmarks, PSEP out—
performs not only previous tools that utilize evolutionary conservation, but also several highly
used tools that include multiple other sources of information as well. For predicting pathogenic
human variants, the trace back of course starts with a human 'reference’ protein sequence, but the
PSEP tool can also be applied to predicting deleterious or pathogenic variants in reference proteins
from any of the ~100 other species in the PANTHER database.

Recent advances in sequencing technology have increased the rate of
genetic variation discoveries, thus exacerbating the problem of inter—
preting these genetic variations. Here, we focus on non—synonymous
single nucleotide variants (NSVs), a type of genetic variation that re—
sults in a single amino acid substitution in an encoded protein. Most
computational tools for predicting the functional consequences of
NSVs, including SIFT (Ng and Henikoff, 2003), PolyPhen
(Adzhubei et (11., 2010; Ramensky et (11., 2002) and PANTHER—
PSEC (Thomas et (11., 2003), rely at least in part on the assumption

evolution due to negative selection (i.e. amino acid changes at these
sites were deleterious in the past), and that mutations at these sites
have an increased likelihood of being pathogenic (causing disease) in
humans. In general, homologous sequences of a target protein are
collected and aligned, and a metric of conservation is computed
based on the weighted frequencies of different amino acids observed
in the target position in the alignment.

Here, we present a new tool, PANTHER—PSEP (position—specific
evolutionary preservation) for predicting potentially pathogenic or

deleterious NSVs. PANTHER—PSEP is different from other variant
prediction tools, in that PSEP uses a metric based on evolutionary
preservation (Marini et al., 2010). Preservation is related to conser—
vation, as it also reflects the effect of negative selection that has
acted to prevent evolutionary change at a given site in a protein. It is
also related to earlier methods that utilize a phylogenetic tree in add—
ition to a multiple sequence alignment, pioneered by the
Evolutionary Trace method (Lichtarge et al., 1996) and later applied
to variant pathogenicity prediction in the PANTHER—PSECv2
(Thomas and Kejariwal, 2004) and Evolutionary Action (Katsonis
and Lichtarge, 2014) methods. But unlike these other approaches,
preservation uses ancestral sequence reconstruction to assess evolu—
tionary change specifically in the lineage leading to the sequence of
interest. We have previously shown evolutionary preservation to be
superior to conservation for identifying deleterious mutations (in a
growth—based assay) in the human Mthfr protein, as well as the
E.coli lacI protein (Marini et al., 2010). Here, we describe a soft—
ware tool based on the same concept of ancestral preservation, but
using a simple, standardized metric for quantifying preservation. In
PANTHER—PSEP, preservation is measured as the approximate
length of time a site has been preserved, tracing back the lineage
from the relevant human protein, or potentially any other protein in
the PANTHER library (Mi et al., 2013). Because PANTHER trees
are reconciled with the known species tree, we can use best estimates
of speciation times (Hedges et al., 2006) to date the ancestral preser—
vation of each site.

2 Methods

2.1 Trees, alignments and ancestral sequence
reconstruction

Sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees were obtained from the
PANTHER database (Mi et al., 2013), version 9.0. For each family
in PANTHER, we reconstructed the ancestral sequences for all com—
mon ancestors (internal nodes) in the tree using PAML (Yang,
1997), with the PANTHER tree and alignment as input. The recon—
struction was performed at the amino acid level, using default par—
ameters and the WAG substitution model (Whelan and Goldman,
2001).

2.2 Input and output

Input is a reference protein sequence and one or more single—site sub—
stitutions in that sequence. The input protein sequence is searched
against the PANTHER sequences using BLASTP (Camacho et al.,
2009) to find the best—matching PANTHER sequence (tree leaf
node). The target amino acid is traced from the leaf back through in—
creasingly older ancestral proteins in the tree. This trace stops if the
target amino acid is different from the corresponding amino acid in
the ancestral sequence, or if the amino acid reconstruction probabil—
ity is less than a predefined threshold, and the age (in millions of
years) of the last preserved ancestor is reported. The reconstruction
probability threshold is the only free parameter in the PSEP method.
We determined the optimal threshold on the HumVar dataset
(Capriotti et al., 2006), a commonly used dataset for pathogenic
human variant prediction methods, but we find that the choice of
threshold has very little effect on the performance of PSEP
(Supplemental Fig. S1).

2.3 Testing and comparing to other methods
We validated PANTHER—PSEP on the SwissVarSelected dataset
(Grimm et al., 2015; Mottaz et al., 2010), which was recently shown

to be the most appropriate set for this purpose as it avoids major
issues that can confound comparisons between different methods.
This dataset is independent of the HumVar dataset (as well as other
datasets that are commonly used for training and parameterization
of NSV prediction methods), and is well balanced in representing
pathogenic and benign variants across a variety of proteins (Grimm
et al., 2015). Using SwissVarSelected, we can compare PANTHER—
PSEP with similar, sequence alignment—based methods as well as
with ‘combined’ methods that include multiple sources of informa—
tion in addition to sequence alignments (Fig. 1 and Supplemental
Fig. S2). Finally, in order to facilitate comparisons with previously
published results, we also assessed PANTHER—PSEP on the
HumVar, SwissVar (Capriotti et al., 2013; Mottaz et al., 2010) and
VariBench (Schwarz et al., 2010) datasets (Supplemental Figs S3—S5;
Supplemental Table S1).

3 Implementation

PANTHER—PSEP is implemented both as a standalone tool and a
web server. The software tool is written in Perl. The web server
(available at http://pantherdb.org/tools/csnpScoreForm.jsp) uses the
same code base as the standalone tool, with an interface written in
Java and HTML.

4 Results and conclusions

Figure 1 shows that on the SwissVarSelected dataset, PANTHER—
PSEP performs better than previously published sequence align—
ment—based methods. This performance is somewhat surprising, es—
pecially as PSEP does not use any prior information commonly
used in evolutionary conservation methods, such as amino acid
chemical similarity. The superior performance of PSEP suggests
that preservation may be a more informative way to use homolo—
gous sequence data than conservation. Perhaps even more surpris—
ingly, PSEP outperforms many trained, multi—feature prediction

predicting pathogenic variants, on the SwissVarSelected dataset. The most
closely comparable tools are shown in red; these are all ‘unweighted' tools
that, like PSEP, use only multiple sequence alignment information
(PANTHER-PSEC, SIFT and FATHMM). Other tools are shown in blue; these
are weighted methods that use multiple additional features (FATHMM,
PolyPhen-2, MutationAssessor, MutationTasterZ, LRT and CADD). Data are

methods. The high performance is also reﬂected in comparisons on
the HumVar and SwissVar datasets; performance on VariBench is
similar to current sequence—based methods, though the significance
of this is unclear due to biases recently uncovered in this bench—
mark (Grimm et al., 2015). PSEP scores are correlated with, but in
many cases are complementary to, scores from CADD (Kircher
et al., 2014) (Supplemental Fig. S6). Taken together, these results
suggest that PANTHER—PSEP could be a useful addition to multi—
feature prediction methods such as CADD, PolyPhen—2 (Adzhubei
et al., 2010), MutPred (Li et al., 2009) and SNPSSCGO (Calabrese
et al., 2009). Finally, we emphasize that the metric for preservation
employed here is an extremely simple one. It considers only preser—
vation of the exact amino acid, and therefore chemically conserva—
tive substitutions are treated the same as radical changes. It also
reports a preservation time, rather than considering how this met—
ric might scale for lineages other than human, that have different
generation times and population histories. Future developments
could consider more sophisticated metrics based on the same evo—
lutionary model.

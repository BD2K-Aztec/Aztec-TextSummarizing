Abstract

Summary: Demultiplexing is used after high—throughput sequencing to in silico assign reads to the
samples of origin based on the sequenced reads ofthe indices. Existing demultiplexing tools based
on the similarity between the read index and the reference index sequences may fail to provide
satisfactory results on low—quality datasets. We developed Bayexer, a Bayesian demultiplexing
algorithm for Illumina sequencers. Bayexer uses the information extracted directly from the con—
taminant sequences of the targeting reads as the training dataset for a naive Bayes classifier to as—
sign reads. According to our evaluation, Bayexer provides higher capability, accuracy and speed

on various real datasets than othertools.

Availability and implementation: Bayexer is implemented in Perl and freely available at https://

1 Introduction

Although the rapid improvement of next-generation sequencing is
dramatically increasing data output and reducing sequencing costs,
multiplexing, which allows large numbers of samples to be
sequenced simultaneously during a single sequencing run, is also
raising sample throughput. Commonly, multiplexing is achieved by
adding different specifically designed short sequences, referred to as
indices, to the sequencing adapters of each sample. The in silico pro-
cess after sequencing to determine the origin sample of each read by
comparing the sequenced indices (SIs) with the reference indices
(RIs) is called demultiplexing.

Because sequencing errors occur, SIs do not always perfectly
match the RIs. The demultiplexers (CASAVA, bchfastq) provided
by Illumina allow for O, l or 2 Hamming distances between the SIs
and RIs. Splitaake (https://github.com/faircloth-lab/splitaake) and
deindexer (https://github.com/ws6/deindexer) use Levenshtein dis-
tances to tolerate the IN-DEL (insertion and deletion) errors.

Recently developed, deML (Renaud et (11., 2015) uses the quality
scores of SI bases to assign each read to the origin sample with the
maximum likelihood.

These approaches work well for high-quality reads but for low-
quality reads the results may be unsatisfactory due to misassignment
or assignment failure. It is widely reported that there are various
types of inherent error profiles in Illumina sequencing data (Dohm
et (11., 2008; Harismendy et (11., 2009; Hoffmann et (11., 2009;
Kircher et (11., 2009; Nakamura et (11., 2011), which suggests
that certain miscalls may be more likely than others, and an error-
containing SI probably originated from one certain RI. Additionally,
it is a ubiquitous phenomenon during Illumina sequencing that in-
sert sequences shorter than the read length result in adaptor contam-
ination on the ends of common reads and the index bases are often
contained in the contaminant sequences. Therefore, demultiplexing
could be seen as a classification problem with RIs identified
from contaminant sequences as classes, and the corresponding SIs

In summary, we present Bayexer, an Illumina sequence demulti—
plexer which outperforms other available tools on both accuracy
and speed. In particular, the great advantage of accuracy on
low—quality reads indicated that Bayexer can significantly improve
the utilization ratio of low—quality sequencing data and thus benefit
a wide range of high—throughput sequencing projects.

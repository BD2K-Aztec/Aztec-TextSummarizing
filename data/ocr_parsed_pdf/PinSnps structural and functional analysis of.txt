Abstract

Summary: We present a practical computational pipeline to readily perform data analyses of pro—
tein—protein interaction networks by using genetic and functional information mapped onto protein
structures. We provide a 3D representation of the available protein structure and its regions (sur—
face, interface, core and disordered) for the selected genetic variants and/or SNPs, and a prediction
of the mutants’ impact on the protein as measured by a range of methods. We have mapped in
total 2587 genetic disorder—related SNPs from OMIM, 587 873 cancer—related variants from
COSMIC, and 1 484 045 SNPs from dbSNP. All result data can be downloaded by the user together
with an R—script to compute the enrichment of SNPs/variants in selected structural regions.

Availability and Implementation: PinSnps is available as open—access service at http://fraternalilab.

1 Introduction

High—throughput experiments are routinely performed to decipher
genetic, metabolic and protein—protein interaction networks
(PPINs) and bioinformaticians are compelled to develop efficient
and accurate tools to assist decision—making based on available
data from multiple sources (Chung et (11., 2015; Fernandes et (11.,
2010; Lu et (11., 2013). Bioinformatics applications, which merge
available genomic, interaction and structural data, can be broadly
classified into exploratory or predictive tools. The former com—
prises of tools which map and visualize the merged data (Kelley
et (11., 2015; Lees et (11., 2010; Mosca et (11., 2015; Niknafs et (11.,
2013; Pappalardo and Wass, 2014; Ryan et (11., 2009; Vazquez
et (11., 2015), while predictive tools are quantitative estimators of
the potential impact of SNPs/variants and offer an assessment in
terms of scores or pseudo free—energy metrics (Adzhubei et (11.,
2010; Betts et (11., 2015; Li et (11., 2014; Ng and Henikoff, 2003;
Pires et (11., 2014a; Pires et (11., 2014b; Pires et (11., 2016; Yates
et (11., 2014).

In this application, we use 3D interactome networks and their
homologs to highlight how human variants and disease—causing mu—
tations may affect protein function and complex stability. Recent
studies have used the structural information of PPINs to understand
the molecular mechanisms of binding partner selection (Fornili
et (11., 2013). These reliable methods only consider the interactions
that have a representative 3D structure or a close homolog with a
3D structure to add weight to the existence of the observed protein
interactions (or network links) in a given PPIN (Hooda and Kim,
2012; Kim et (11., 2006; Lees et (11., 2011; Meyer et (11., 2013; Mosca
et (11., 2013; Wang et (11., 2012). Multiple studies have pointed out
that the interfaces of protein complexes harbours mutations associ—
ated with diseases (Espinosa et (11., 2014; Gao et (11., 2015;
Kamburov et (11., 2015; Nishi et (11., 2013; Studer et (11., 2013; Wang
et (11., 2012; Yates and Sternberg, 2013a,b). The evaluation of the
impact of genomic variation on coding regions can be enhanced by
mapping SNPs to distinct regions of protein structure, i.e. surface,
interface or core. To generate a comprehensive mapping of available

SNPs onto PPINs, the automatic pipeline PinSnps has been de—
veloped (for details see Supplementary Fig. S2); this extracts struc—
ture—integrated human PPINs, enriched with information from
homologous protein domains with sequence identity higher than
30%. The main strengths and differences to previous approaches lie
in (i) the use of homologous structures of human protein sequences
in the PPINs to map the studied variants, which more than doubles
the available positional 3D information; (ii) the mapping onto pre—
defined protein regions (surface, core, interface) along with the map—
ping of functional sites and Post—Translational Modifications
(PTMs) (obtained from UniProt (UniProt Consortium, 2015)). This
information, together with precompiled predictions of the SNP/vari—
ant’s impact from multiple predictors, can help users to quantita—
tively assess and evaluate the functional implications of their studied
variants. The annotation of both intra— and inter—domain disordered
regions as predicted by DISOPRED2 (Ward et 41]., 2004) has also
been included in the pipeline, as recent studies imply the importance
of these regions in regulating biological functions (Cline and
Karchin, 2011; Gibbs and Showalter, 2015; Wright and Dyson,
2015); (iii) allowing the users to download the query data in various
file formats (Fig. 1).

2 Implementation and features

The PPIN used in this study has been derived as a non—redundant set
of protein interactions from the list of human PPIs given in
Supplementary Table S1. The current release includes data of 16
603 proteins, of which 4673 have a resolved structure and 4962
have a homologous structure (Supplementary Fig. S3).

PinSnps is, to our knowledge, one of the largest collections of
variants mapped onto 3D coordinates. SNPs from dbSNP (Sherry
et 41]., 2001), consisting of common and germ—line disease variants
(the later originally from OMIM (Hamosh et 41]., 2005)), together

with somatic cancer mutations from COSMIC (Forbes et 41].,
2015) have been mapped onto cognate 3D structures and, when
not available, to their homologous structures. The use of homolo—
gous structures expands significantly the number of SNPs/variants
mapped onto 3D positions within folded domains. The enrichment
of disease—associated variants in specific regions of proteins can be
quantified using Formula S1 and the R script which is provided on
the PinSnps ‘Downloads’ webpage (see example in Supplementary
Fig. S4).

We present a number of case studies and more detailed instruc—
tions on the web server’s ‘Help’ page and in the Supplementary
Materials.

2.1 Protein sequence annotated profiles

Each protein in the PPIN is transformed into a sequence—anno—
tated string (we refer to this as ‘profile’) that represents the fin—
gerprint of the user—selected information. These profiles were
generated based on information obtained from sequence align—
ments, available structural information, human genetic data
(from dbSNP, OMIM and COSMIC) and UniProt protein func—
tional site and PTM annotations. PSI—BLAST (Altschul et 41].,
1997) was used to identify resolved and homologous structures
of human proteins by searching against sequences of the Protein
Data Bank (Berman et 41]., 2000). Homologous structures with
more than 80% coverage of the human protein domain sequence
and with more than 30% sequence identity were selected. Each
protein was annotated with domain boundaries according to
Pfam (Finn et al., 2014). Alignments between sequences of query
protein domains and available protein structure sequences were
performed using T—Coffee (Notredame et 41]., 2000). The classifi—
cation of structural regions, i.e. the definition of surface, inter—
face and core regions, was based on the surface area analysis of
POPSCOMP (Kleinjung and Fraternali, 2005).

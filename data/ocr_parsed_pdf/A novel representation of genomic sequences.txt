Abstract

Motivation: Self—organizing maps (SOMs) are readily available bioinformatics methods for cluster—
ing and visualizing high—dimensional data, provided that such biological information is previously
transformed to fixed—size, metric—based vectors. To increase the usefulness of SOM—based
approaches for the analysis of genomic sequence data, novel representation methods are required
that automatically and bijectively transform aligned nucleotide sequences into numeric vectors,
dealing with both nucleotide ambiguity and gaps derived from sequence alignment.

Results: Six different codification variants based on Euclidean space, just like SOM processing,
have been tested using two SOM models: the classical Kohonen’s SOM and growing cell struc—
tures. They have been applied to two different sets of sequences: 32 sequences of small sub—unit
ribosomal RNA from organisms belonging to the three domains of life, and 44 sequences of the
reverse transcriptase region of the pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 belonging
to different groups and sub—types. Our results show that the most important factor affecting the
accuracy of sequence clustering is the assignment of an extra weight to the presence of alignment—
derived gaps. Although each of the codification variants shows a different level of taxonomic
consistency, the results are in agreement with sequence—based phylogenetic reconstructions and
anticipate a broad applicability of this codification method.

A novel representation of genomic sequences

1 Introduction

Genomic sequence data is continuously produced and processed in
fields ranging from biomedicine to biotechnology. Over the last dec—
ade, the completion of several genome sequence projects and the ad—
vent of next generation, high—throughput sequencing techniques
have dramatically increased the amount of sequence data stored in
databases. As a consequence, fast algorithms and methods are being
developed for converting the growing number of nucleotide se—
quences into useful information, such as data classes and clusters,
sets of the most relevant features or hidden relationships among
data, to cite the most common ones. Within this framework, the
need for automatic massive sequence classification techniques is
becoming more acute, requiring methods that are able to efficiently
process and classify genomic data.

One commonly used technique for data clustering and visualiza—
tion is Kohonen’s self—organizing map (SOM; Kohonen, 2001),
which allows processing a variety of biological data (Boyle et (11.,
2014; Chavez—Alvarez et (11., 2014). SOM performs an unsupervised
clustering process, i.e. during the training the patterns are spatially
organized considering only their homology, without knowing the
class to which they belong (Vesanto and Alhoniemi, 2000; Xu and
Wunsch, 2005; Astel et (11., 2007). Therefore, the use of an unsuper—
vised method like SOM seems very appropriate for genomic
sequence clustering and, thus, representation, since it is able to con—
duct exploratory data analysis and visualization without the need
for calibration or classification of the information to be processed.
In comparison with other clustering methods, SOM adds the feature
of spatially ordering the sequences on a two—dimensional (2D) map,
thus, providing not only the clustering of the sequences into groups,
but also the similarity or dissimilarity with all other groups of se—
quences. This could be very useful for organizing large sequence
databases, as well as for quickly and accurately ordering newly
obtained sequences.

SOM creates a model composed of neurons, each with a proto—
type vector. The neurons are organized into a grid, which optimally
represents the set of input data included into the training set
(Murtagh and Hernandez—Pajares, 1995). This model is self—
organized by a training algorithm based on two fundamental con—
cepts: the neighborhood relationship among the prototype vectors
placed in such a grid, and the smooth adaptation of prototype vec—
tors over the vectors in the training set. Traditional SOM works
with continuous numeric input space and Euclidean distances, and it
cannot be directly used for processing strings of symbols such as nu—
cleotide or amino acid sequences. Different authors, including
Kohonen and Somervuo (2002) have highlighted this fact as a major
limitation of the method. Two alternative approaches have been
suggested in the literature to solve this problem: to transform the
training algorithm to be able to work with a discrete input space,
and to convert the character sequences into numeric vectors and
then use a traditional SOM.

The String SOM model (Kohonen and Somervuo, 2002) is com—
prised within the first option. It relies on the FASTA method
(Pearson and Lipman, 1988) to compute similarity between se—
quences, and either the generalized median or the set median is used
to adapt the string prototype vectors. However, this model presents
several limitations. On the one hand, the algorithm for calculating
the generalized median, i.e. the sequence (over the set of all possible
sequences) that minimizes the sum of distances to every sequence
of the set, is extremely time—consuming (Jiang et (11., 2004; Solnon
and Jolion, 2007). On the other hand, the set median, where string
prototype values are restricted to the set of training sequences,

constitutes a severe restriction, in particular for small data sets, be—
cause it can infer non—representative prototype strings. Furthermore,
String SOM is highly sensitive to prototype initialization (Kohonen
and Somervuo, 2002), forcing the prototype vectors to be roughly
ordered in advance.

Transforming sequences into numeric vectors and training a
traditional SOM is the second option. The conversion of sequences
into same—length vectors in a meaningful way is a computational
challenge, and two types of approaches are possible to accomplish
this goal. The first type transforms sequences of variable length
into fixed—length numeric vectors without a preliminary alignment
(Dozono, 2014; Almeida and Vinga, 2009; Fankhauser and Maser,
2005). However, most of the sequence—vector pairs are not bijec—
tive, i.e. the position of the nucleotide in the original (DNA or
RNA) sequence is not embedded in the final vector, since it often
represents either a frequency histogram or a picture. Thus, the
information residing in the succession of elements in the sequence
of characters is lost and it is not possible to fully reconstruct the
original sequence from the numeric vector sequence. This can con—
stitute a constraint when SOM method is used to process these nu—
meric vectors, because in traditional SOM, based on a continuous
numeric space, prototype vectors virtually never match any of the
training vectors. SOM prototype and training vectors share the
same nature and dimension, and conceptually each prototype vec—
tor symbolizes the centroid of the training vectors that are within
its inﬂuence region. Therefore, when a SOM is trained using nu—
cleotide sequences previously transformed into numeric vectors,
a bijective transformation algorithm becomes desirable to analyse
the prototype vectors of the SOM in their nucleotide sequence for—
mat. The second type of methods for transforming sequences into
numeric vectors requires a preliminary alignment of the sequences.
They are usually bijective, but typically produce very long numeric
vectors (Andrade et (11., 1997; Nantasenamat et (11., 2009; Afreixo
et (11., 2009). Kwan and Arniker (2009) presented an analysis
of some bijective numerical representation methods of DNA se—
quences, highlighting the final length of the numerical vectors. The
combination of the bijective DNA transformation methods with
traditional SOMs is reinforced by the following facts: (i) SOM
prototype vectors are not limited to the set of training vectors;
(ii) the training algorithm is computed efficiently since it works
with numeric vectors instead of strings; (iii) given its bijective
nature, it can alternatively work with nucleotide sequences or
numeric vectors.

The work reported here presents a new bijective method with
six different variants for coding nucleotide sequences. These have
been tested using two numeric SOM models: the classical Kohonen
SOM (Kohonen, 2001), as well as an improved version of growing
cell structures (GCS; Fritzke, 1994; Delgado et (11., 2011). The for—
mer is known for its usefulness in graphical exploratory data ana—
lysis, and the latter for providing better clustering results due to its
ﬂexible architecture. Two sets of DNA sequences have been used
to validate the coding variants of the method: 32 small sub—unit
ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) from organisms belonging to the three
domains of life, and 44 sequences of the reverse transcriptase region
of the pol gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV—1)
belonging to different groups and sub—types. The six variants of the
proposed transforming method have been compared. We found that
the two SOM models distribute the encoded sequences according
to their taxonomic diversity and phylogenetic relationships. In par—
ticular, two of the six coding variants have produced highly accurate
results.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Sequence codification

A DNA sequence can be viewed as a string of symbols of a finite
alphabet {A, G, C, T}: the nucleotides adenine, guanine, cytosine
and thymine (with uracil—U—instead of T in the case of RNA).
When more than one kind of nucleotide can appear at a given pos—
ition in the string, as the consequence of either a technical problem
(e.g., an ambiguous nucleotide assignment during the sequencing
process), or the inherent variability within an heterogeneous popula—
tion (e.g. a mixture of nucleotides at a certain position of the consen—
sus sequence of an RNA virus population), additional symbols must
be used, following IUPAC nomenclature rules: R (A or G), Y (C or
T), K (G or T), M (A or C), S (G or C), W (A or T), B (G, C or T), D
(A, G or T), H (A, C, or T), v (A, G or C), N (A, G, C, or T). The
bijective transformation method presented in this article requires
a preliminary alignment of the sequences to be compared, so it is ne—
cessary to consider an additional symbol for the alphabet, the ‘gap’
or ‘—’. The alignment of the sequences yields vectors of the same
length, since this process fills with gaps the extra positions that are
present only in a subset of the aligned sequences. In summary, the
DNA alphabet for any aligned sequence consists of 16 symbols:
{A, G, C, T, R, Y, K, M, s, W, B, D, H, V, N, —}.

The codification method used here is related to that proposed by
Lo et al. (2007), consisting of mapping the symbols A, G, C and T
on the four vertices of a regular tetrahedron (Supplementary Fig
S1A). Each nucleotide is then transformed into a numeric vector,
representing the 3D Euclidean coordinates of its corresponding ver—
tex. Here we propose an extended DNA codification method includ—
ing the eleven nucleotide ambiguity symbols. They are coded using
the 3D coordinates corresponding to the midpoint of the edge join—
ing the vertices occupied by the two possible nucleotides (for R, Y,
K, M, S and W symbols), the centroid of the plane defined by the
vertices that code the three possible nucleotides (for B, D, H and V
symbols), or the centroid of the tetrahedron for the N symbol
(Supplementary Fig S1A).

Additionally, two novel variables have been implemented to dif—
ferently weight each of the possible nucleotide mutations in a DNA
sequence: (a) tetrahedron symmetry, affecting any nucleotide substi—
tution, and (b) gap codification (symbol ‘—’), related to the insertion/
deletion mutations, also called ‘indels’. Regarding the first factor,
two further options are proposed: (a1) a regular tetrahedron with
distance 1 between all its vertices, or (a2) an irregular tetrahedron
with distance 1 for the edges joining the vertices A—G (purine nu—
cleotides) and C—T (pyrimidine nucleotides), and distance 2 for
those joining A—C and G—T (Supplementary Fig S1). Thus, in the
regular tetrahedron all kinds of nucleotide mutations have the same
weight. In turn, using the irregular one, a transition mutation
(that produced between either the purine nucleotides or the pyrimi—
dine ones) is considered closer than a transversion (that converting
a purine into a pyrimidine or vice versa), since the latter is less
thermodynamically favored and consequently appears less fre—
quently in nature. Indeed, most of the computer programs for infer—
ring molecular phylogenies (e.g. the PHYLIP package; http://
evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html) include the Kimura
2—parameter correction method for estimating distances between
sequences, which weights the transitions/transversions ratio as 2
(Kimura, 1980).

With respect to gap coding, two options are also considered:
(b1) each gap is computed as a substitution mutation, assigning
it the 3D coordinates of the centroid of the tetrahedron (equivalent
to the ambiguous symbol N), or (b2) the gap reﬂects a new class of

genetic rearrangement (one ‘indel’ in at least one of the aligned se—
quences) that requires weighting it in a different way. To encode the
latter option, a fourth dimension (4D) has been incorporated to the
3D numeric vector, taking the value 0 for all the alphabet symbols
except for the gap, whose three first coordinates remain those of the
centroid of the tetrahedron. Two possible values have been con—
sidered for the fourth dimension of the gap: (b2.1) near (at a dis—
tance 2), and (b2.2) far (at a distance 4). The combination of the
tetrahedron symmetry and gap coding options has led to the six
DNA coding variants presented in this article: 3DReg, 4DRegNear,
4DRegFar, 3DIrreg, 4DIrrNear and 4DIrrFar. The coordinates
corresponding to each symbol in these coding variants are shown in
Supplementary Table S1.

Given an aligned DNA sequence of L nucleotides, the use of any
of the 3D coding variants results in a numeric vector of length
3 X L, and the use of any of the 4D ones produces a 4 X L—long nu—
meric vector. The original DNA sequence can be retrieved from the
numeric vector by transforming each subsequence of / numbers
(where / takes the value 3 for 3D codifications and 4 for 4D codifica—
tions) into an alphabet symbol, calculating the closest coding pos—
ition (nucleotide, ambiguous nucleotide or gap) in the tetrahedron
by means of Euclidean distance (Supplementary Fig S2 shows an
example illustrating the transformation of a DNA sequence into
the 3DReg codified vector, and vice versa, the transformation of a
3DReg codified vector into the corresponding DNA sequence).

2.2 Datasets

To make a comparative study of the six coding variants proposed
in this work, two sets of nucleotide sequence data have been used.
The first of them (termed ‘Biodiversity dataset’) includes sequences
of SSU rRNA (the molecule considered as the best ‘molecular clock’
for phylogenetic studies since the pioneering work of Woese and
Fox (1977; Sapp, 2009), of 32 organisms belonging to the three
major groups or domains of cellular life: Archaea (18 sequences),
Bacteria (8) and Eukarya (6). This set of data has been previously
used to compare the phylogenetic reconstructions based on sequence
data with those derived from functional information (Briones et al.,
2005). Interestingly, the group of organisms included in this bio—
diversity set shows a different degree of taxonomic diversity within
each domain, thus, allowing an evaluation of the limit of resolution
of the different codification variants of the clustering method used
here. The Biodiversity dataset includes a large number of gaps
derived from the sequence alignment (see Supplementary Material;
Supplementary Table S2 for details).

The second set (termed ‘HIV dataset’) contains 44 complete
sequences of the RT region of the pol gene of HIV—1 belonging to
the three phylogenetic groups of this virus (M, O and N), and to all
the subtypes within the group M (A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K). Being a
virus with an RNA genome, HIV—1 displays a very high mutation
rate and the genomic sequences of different isolates show a large
variability (Domingo et al., 2012). However, RT—coding sequence
of the HIV—1 genome is one of the most conserved regions, thus
being a very appropriate genetic marker for comparing taxonomic—
ally distant viral isolates. The HIV dataset includes a low number
of alignment—derived gaps (see Supplementary Material;
Supplementary Table S3 for details).

The whole nucleotide sequences of the Biodiversity and HIV
datasets are shown in Supplementary Table S4. As a reference classi—
fication method for the sequences included in both datasets,
sequence—based phylogenetic analyses have been performed (see
Supplementary Material for details).

3 Results and Discussion

3.1 Reference classification by phylogenetic methods
The Biodiversity dataset shows three clusters of sequences that are
clearly distinguished, statistically supported by bootstrap values
higher than 80% (see Supplementary Fig S3). They correspond to
organisms belonging to the domains Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya.
Within Archaea, the phyla Crenarchaeota and Emyarc/oaeota
(see Supplementary Table S2) are distinguished, and classes within
them are also shown. Although the number of sequences within
Bacteria is smaller, the phyla Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria are
also clearly separated, with the sub—division in classes reﬂected
by the branching order of the clustered species. The six eukaryotic
sequences included in this dataset are also clustered accordingly
to their taxonomic relatedness, with the sequences belonging to the
kingdoms Fungi and Viridiplantae grouping together.

In HIV dataset, sequences belonging to the group O are sepa—
rated from those of the groups N and M (Supplementary Fig S4).
Within group M, all the sub—types (Supplementary Table S3) are
clearly distinguished, with the pairs F—K and B—D grouping together.
The clustering shows sub—subtype resolution, since the separation
between sub—subtypes A1—A2 and F1—F2 is supported by high boot—
strap values within sub—types A and F, respectively.

3.2 Leave—one—out

The leave—one—out cross—validation technique has been applied to
the codification variants for Biodiversity and HIV datasets (see
Supplementary material for details about Kohonen and GCS models,
quality error measures and SOM training parameters used).
Since the Biodiversity dataset presents a high volume of gaps in its
32 sequences (22% per sequence, on average), it becomes especially
appropriate to study the gap—coding factor.

Within Biodiversity dataset, for each of the six coding variants,
32 Kohonen networks with a 6 X 6 size in the output layer, and
32 GCS networks with three clusters of neurons in the output layer
have been trained (see Supplementary material for details about
leave—one—out results; Supplementary Fig S5; Supplementary Tables
S5 and S6).

The weight associated to gaps is the only difference between
4DNear and 4DFar coding variants (Supplementary Table S1).
Cross validation performed on the Biodiversity dataset with
Kohonen and GCS networks showed that the weight gain of the gap
incorporated in the 4DFar variant does not improve error outcomes
in comparison with 4DNear variants. Since this result was obtained
with a dataset showing a high percentage (22%) of gaps in the
aligned sequences, the leave—one—out technique has been applied to
the HIV dataset (with 0.4% gaps) using only the 3D and 4DNear
codifications. In this case, the focus has been put on the comparison
between the regular vs. irregular tetrahedron.

For each of the four coding variants used with the HIV dataset,
44 Kohonen networks with a 9 X 9 size in the output layer, and 44
GCS networks with 6 clusters of neurons in the output layer have
been trained (see Supplementary material for details about leave—
one—out results, as well as Supplementary Fig S6; Supplementary
Tables S7 and S8). Due to the small number of sequences belonging
to the HIV—1 groups O and N within the dataset, the optimal num—
ber of clusters obtained for GCS networks is smaller than the num—
ber of groups plus sub—types in the set (see Supplementary Table S3).

The following common results within both datasets must be
highlighted: (i) similar quality error measurements have been
obtained using both types of networks, Kohonen and GCS, for all
the coding variants; (ii) the comparison of variants based on each of

the tetrahedron symmetries shows that both quality error measure—
ments yield better results for 4D variants with respect to their cor—
responding 3D ones, despite the low percentage of gaps in HIV
dataset; (iii) the 3DIrreg variant improves Hamming error measures
compared with the 3DReg.

The analysis of the classification accuracy within Biodiversity
dataset showed that the sequence not used in the training of the net—
work has always been correctly classified according to its phylogen—
etic domain (see Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). Furthermore,
with HIV dataset the percentage of sequences correctly classified
within their phylogenetic group (M, N and O) is 100% in all cases
except for 4DRegNear variant using GCS networks (97.73%) (see
Supplementary Tables S7—S9). In both datasets, the mapping of
most of the sequences not used in training is highly consistent, and
such a consistency could be further improved by including a higher
number of sequences. In most cases, cross validation with GCS net—
works has thrown classification success rates slightly lower than
Kohonen networks (see Supplementary Tables S5—S8). This fact
may be due to the compact clustering performed by this type of net—
work that generally stores inherent knowledge of the training se—
quences in a smaller volume of neurons than Kohonen network.

The evaluation of the codification factor affecting the nucleotide
substitution mutations showed that, on the one hand, the compari—
son of 4DRegNear and 4DIrrNear variants in both datasets ren—
dered similar results with respect to Hamming distances, while
4DRegNear improved numeric error measures. Conversely, by com—
paring 3D variants, the codification based on an irregular tetrahe—
dron (3DIrreg) produced better Hamming distances (2% and
0.1—2% improvements in Biodiversity and HIV datasets, respect—
ively) but slightly higher values in numeric error measures. The 4D
variant that rendered the best results (4DRegNear) compared with
the best 3D variant (3DIrreg) improved in 2—4% Hamming distance
measures and also showed better mean numeric error results.
However, it should not be neglected that any 4D codification gener—
ates longer vectors (4 X L) than those obtained with 3D encoding
variants (3 X L), which subsequently affects the processing of such
vectors both in terms of memory space and computational time.
The SOM training time is directly correlated to the length and the
number of training vectors. If the training dataset has many se—
quences with many nucleotides, it may be impossible to hold them
in memory, and they should be read from disc at each learning iter—
ation. Considering that reading a sequence from disc is several
orders of magnitude slower than getting from memory (about 200
000 times higher), any improvement in the training time is desirable.
For the same number of training iterations and neurons in the net—
work, the training time relationship between 3D versus 4D codifica—
tion variants is 3/4. If either vector size or computation speed
becomes critical factor (e.g. when much longer sequences or a higher
number of them are to be classified), 3DIrreg would be the best
choice among the six variants proposed for encoding DNA
sequences.

3.3 Distribution of sequences by means of SOM

After applying the leave—one—out methodology, several SOMs have
been trained using the complete set of sequences of Biodiversity and
HIV. In Kohonen networks, the higher the learning rate (0(1) the
higher the final dispersion of sequences is, although this decreases
the topology preservation of the network [measured using the
Kaski—Lagus function (Kaski and Lagus, 1996)]. Values of learning
rate in the range [0.1, 0.2] get a right balance between both param—
eters. In this section, Kohonen networks have been trained with the

112 /310'S[BIIJHO[pJOJXO'SOIJ’BLUJOJIIIOICI”Idllq 11101} pQPBOIII/lAOG

S. Delgado et al.

 

extreme values of this range to analyse the influence of the learning
rate in the level of taxonomic resolution and topology preservation
of the networks. For each of the trained networks, the U—matrix
is calculated (see SOM visualization on Supplementary material),
and all the training sequences are mapped and labeled over the
neuron that best matches with the pattern in Euclidean distance
(the so—called ‘best matching unit’, bmu).

Four Kohonen SOMs with a 6 X 6 size and two GCS networks
with three clusters of neurons in the output layer have been trained
using the 32 SSU rRNA sequences of the Biodiversity dataset
codified by 4DRegNear and 3DIrreg variants. The labeled U—matrix
obtained for the six networks is shown in Figure 1. Outlined circles
represent the neurons, gray—scale tone inside the circle indicates the
mean Euclidean distance between the prototype vector of the neuron
and its immediate neighbors, and the gray tone of the circles without
outline placed between two neighboring neurons identifies the
Euclidean distance between both prototype vectors (where black
means little distance, and white large distance). For the sake of clar—
ity, we arranged the labels of the sequences around the map
and joint each group with its bmu by a line. The six U—matrices
depicted in Figure 1 show the correct mapping of the 32 sequences
of Biodiversity dataset within the phylogenetic domain to which
they belong (see Supplementary Fig S3). The four Kohonen net—
works trained with the two learning rate values clearly display the
higher sequence dispersion effect when 061 : 0.2 is used (Fig. 1A ver—
sus C and B versus D), while the topographic error measured with
Kaski—Lagus function grows from 13.71 to 21.61 in the 4DRegNear
variant and from 19.24 to 23.36 within 3DIrreg. Comparing the
distribution of sequences obtained by the two Kohonen SOM
trained using the learning rate 061 : 0.1, it is noteworthy that the one
trained with the 3DIrreg variant (Fig. 1B) maps the sequences in a
more compact way than that trained with the 4DRegNear (Fig. 1A),
i.e. the number of neurons that map the 32 sequences is smaller.
This two Kohonen networks properly discriminated the phyla
Crenarchaeota and Euryarc/oaeota within Archaea domain, and
the one trained using the variant 4DRegNear (Fig. 1A) completely
separated the classes within them (see Supplementary Table S2).
However, despite the wider distribution of sequences in the network
trained with 4DRegNear variant (Fig. 1A), none of the two
Kohonen networks allowed the complete discrimination of either
the phyla Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria within Bacteria or the
kingdoms within Eukarya. However, the two Kohonen networks
trained with the learning rate 061 20.2 showed a higher discrimin—
ation power (Fig. 1C and D), getting class—resolution within
Archaea and Bacteria domains, and phylum—resolution within
Eukarya. Regarding the GCS networks, both the one trained with
the 4DRegNear variant (Fig. 1E) and that trained with the 3DIrreg
(Fig. 1F) produced three clusters of neurons, unequivocally
assigning the sequences to each of the three phylogenetic domains
present in the dataset. In this case, the phyla Crenarchaeota
and Euryarc/oaeota within Archaea domain are clearly distinguished,
and the class Halobacteria was correctly classified within
Euryarchaeota. However, both networks mapped classes
Methanobacteria and Thermoplasmata on the same neuron (see
Fig. 1E and F; Supplementary Table S2). In addition, the two
GCS networks clearly discriminated the available phyla and
classes within Bacteria. With regard to Eukarya domain, the
network trained with 3DIrreg variant grouped together all the
kingdoms, though the one trained with 4DRegNear variant was
also able to distinguish the sequence representative of the kingdom
Metazoa and that of the Alveolata (see Fig. 1E and F;
Supplementary Table S2).

In turn, using the 44 sequences of the HIV dataset codified by
4DRegNear and 3DIrreg variants, four Kohonen SOMs with a
9 X 9 size and two GCS networks with six clusters of neurons in the
output layer have been trained. Figure 2 shows the labeled U—Matrix
obtained for the six networks. Once again, the two Kohonen net—
works trained with a higher learning rate (061 : 0.2) achieved greater
dispersion of sequences although, again, the topographic error meas—
ured with Kaski—Lagus function grows from 5.80 to 7.62 in the
4DRegNear variant and from 7.61 to 10.28 within 3DIrreg. In net—
works trained using 4DRegNear variant, the sequences have been
correctly classified according to their group, sub—type and sub—sub—
type (see Supplementary Fig S4, and Fig. 2A, C and E). Furthermore,
those trained with 3DIrreg variant discriminated group and sub—
type, but only the Kohonen network trained with «1 20.2 distin—
guishes the sub—subtypes A1 and A2 (see Fig. 2B, D and F). In the
four Kohonen networks, sequences belonging to the group O were
clearly distinguished in a corner of the map (Fig. 2A—D), forming
the cluster of neurons that showed a greater distance to the rest of
clusters. Furthermore, within group M, the sub—types B and D were
identified by neurons placed very close to each other in the map, and
this was also the case for sub—types F and K. This result fully agrees
with the phylogenetic relationship among such HIV—1 sub—types
(see Supplementary Fig S4). In the two GCS networks, a cluster of
neurons identifies the sequences belonging to the group O, while
other cluster groups sub—types B and D (Fig. 2E and F). However,
only the network trained with the 3DIrreg variant grouped F and K
sub—types in the same cluster, thus showing the best discrimination
power with this dataset.

3.4 Comparison with binary codification method

The codification method proposed in this work transforms aligned
symbolic DNA sequences into numeric data and vice versa, and it
could be considered as one the fixed mapping methods (Kwan and
Arniker, 2009). Some of these methods introduce mathematical
properties in the resulting numeric vectors, which do not correspond
to any feature of the DNA sequence. In turn, the variants proposed
in this work use different Euclidean distances to weight DNA muta—
tions due to nucleotide substitutions and ‘indels’. Another drawback
of the DNA encoding methods is the impossibility to deal with sym—
bols corresponding to ambiguous nucleotides and gaps (Kwan and
Arniker, 2009). The ‘binary’ DNA codification is an alternative bi—
jective fixed mapping method that avoids these restrictions
(Andrade et al., 1997; Nantasenamat et al., 2009). In ‘binary’ codifi—
cation the four nucleotides are represented using a probabilistic
encoding (A{1,0,0,0}, G{0,1,0,0}, C{0,0,1,0}, T{0,0,0,1}), with four
numerical values for each nucleotide. This method considers both
the gaps resulting of the sequences alignment and the ambiguous nu—
cleotides. To codify the gap, the four numerical components are set
to zero ({0,0,0,0}), and probability values in the corresponding pos—
itions are used to codify ambiguous nucleotides, e.g. R is coded
as {0.5, 0.5, 0, 0}, B as {0, 0.33, 0.33, 0.33} and N as {0.25, 0.25,
0.25, 0.25}.

To compare 4DRegNear and 3DIrreg variants with this ‘binary’
DNA codification, 50 Kohonen networks have been trained for each
dataset and codification method, and three error measures have
been calculated: the mean of the average quantization error, Qe, the
mean of the Kaski—Lagus function (Kaski and Lagus, 1996), 8k], and
the mean of the average Hamming distance between the training
sequences and their bmu’s previously transformed to DNA format,
Hm% (see Supplementary Material for details about these mean
error measures). The values of Qe and 81d evaluate how well the

A novel representation of genomic sequences

SOM network is adapted to the numeric input data (known as topo—
graphic error measures), and Hm% indicates the accuracy of the
SOM map in representing the input space expressed on DNA se—
quence format. The size of the trained networks was the same than
that used in the previous sections: 6 X 6 for Biodiversity dataset, and
9 X 9 for HIV dataset (with 061 : 0.2, to achieve a greater dispersion
of the sequences).

The proposed 4DRegNear codification variant rendered the best
results in topographic error measures (Qe and 81(1) and average
Hamming distance (Hm%) for both datasets (Supplementary Fig
S7). Conversely, comparing ‘binary’ codification with the proposed
3Dlrreg variant the former has produced better results in average
Hamming distance using both datasets, although with the HIV
3Dlrreg variant got slightly better topographic error measures
(Supplementary Fig S7B).

Among the group of 50 Kohonen SOMs trained with the
Biodiversity dataset and ‘binary’ codification, one showing error
values similar to the mean values Qe, 8k] and Hm% has been se—
lected and the labeled U—matrix has been obtained (Fig. 3A). This
SOM gets class—resolution within Archaea and Bacteria domains,
but it does not discriminate kingdoms within Eucarya (see
Supplementary Fig S3). In this sense, the two Kohonen SOMs
trained with 4DRegNear and 3Dlrreg variants (and 061 : 0.2)
showed a higher discrimination power (Fig. 1C and D).

Figure 3B shows the labeled U—matrix associated with a
Kohonen SOMs trained with HIV dataset using ‘binary’ codification
(one with error values similar to the mean values Qe, 8k] and Hm% ).
In this case, the sequences have been correctly classified according to
their group, sub—type, and sub—subtype (see Supplementary Fig S4),
the same taxonomic resolution as the two Kohonen SOMs trained
with 4DRegNear and 3Dlrreg variants and 061 : 0.2 (Fig. 2C and
D).

For DNA sequences of L nucleotides long, the ‘binary’ method
and the 4DRegNear variant produce numeric vectors of the same
length (4 X L). In this sense, both codifications provide the same
SOM training conditions, but the proposed 4DRegNear variant im—
proves the adaptation measures of the SOM to the input space with
respect to the ‘binary’ codification. Furthermore, the proposed
3Dlrreg variant produces shorter numeric vectors (3 X L). Although
the adaptation measures obtained with this variant are slightly
worse that those obtained with ‘binary’ codification, 3Dlrreg vari—
ant improves the memory requirements and the SOM training time

in a ratio of 3/4. Therefore, both 4DRegNear and 3Dlrreg codifica—
tion variants show clear, though distinct, advantages over the trad—
itionally used ‘binary’ method.

4 Conclusions

In this work, a new bijective technique for coding DNA and RNA
sequences has been developed and tested. The proposed method,
based on the assignment of the nucleotides to the coordinates of the
vertices of either a 3D or a 4D tetrahedron, facilitates the codifica—
tion of ambiguous nucleotides just using geometrical distances be—
tween two, three or four nucleotides. The transformation of
sequences to numeric vectors has proven to be useful for neural net—
works training, as it is the case of Kohonen’s SOM and GCS. The bi—
jective property of the codification method allows coding the
sequences to numeric coordinates and, vice versa, transforming the
prototype vectors to their nucleotide sequence format. The possibil—
ity of working in the space of either sequences or numeric vectors is
one of the advantages of the codification method proposed here.
Then, the error values can be measured either as vectorial
(Euclidean) or Hamming distances. Error measure by means of
Hamming distance, as used in Section 3, has special relevance when
the numeric error measures are not particularly significant.

The SOM neural network model provides a set of relevant ad—
vantages for processing nucleotide sequences, including: (i) it is an
unsupervised method, thus knowing the class associated to the se—
quences is not required; (ii) SOM projects a high—dimensional input
space over a low dimensional one, thus producing several 2D graphs
used to analyse some features of the sequences (e.g. number of clus—
ters, or similarity and distances between sequences); (iii) once the
network has been trained, new sequences can be projected, and the
relationship with those used in the training can be displayed. On
the contrary, the construction of a phylogenetic tree requires the use
of all the sequences with which a new sequence has to be compared.

Two SOM models, Kohonen’s SOM and GCS, and two distinct
sets of sequences, Biodiversity and HIV, have been used for testing
the codification variants. The results presented here show that the
two SOM methods distribute the analysed sequences in agreement
with their taxonomic diversity and phylogenetic relationships. With
Biodiversity dataset, GCS networks were able to discriminate up to
phyla level within Archaea domain, and they got classes resolution

in Bacteria. Conversely, Kohonen SOMs trained with a learning rate
061 : 0.2 discriminated up to class level within Archaea and Bacteria,
and they reached the phyla level for Eukarya. With HIV dataset,
both Kohonen and GCS models achieved group and sub—type reso—
lution, and sub—subtype information was retrieved. Generally, in
GCS model the knowledge is stored in a compact way compared
with Kohonen SOMs, because they typically use fewer neurons.
That is why the projection of the sequences on the GCS maps usu—
ally shows lower dispersion that that of the Kohonen networks.
In addition, GCS networks can automatically cluster the training
sequences, thus producing a cluster of neurons by type if enough
training sequences are available.

Six variants of the method for coding two different sets of nu—
cleotide sequences have been compared. Leave—one—out experiments
with both datasets have shown that 4DRegNear variant provides
the best results in error measurements, independently of the percent—
age of alignment—derived gaps present in each dataset. Regarding the
error measurements of the two 3D variants, 3DIrreg codification
has produced better results than 3DReg variant, both for
Biodiversity and HIV datasets.

The 4DRegNear and 3DIrreg variants, based on Euclidean
space, as SOM processing, have been compared with the bijective
‘binary’ codification method, based on probabilistic values. The re—
sults have shown that 4DRegNear improves the SOM adaptation
measures, while 3DIrreg provides a faster SOM training than the
‘binary’ method. In addition, the use of 4DRegNear and 3DIrreg
variants showed better or equal taxonomic resolutions than the ‘bin—
ary’ method. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the most im—
portant factor affecting the accuracy of sequence classification is the
assignment of an extra weight to the presence of alignment—derived
gaps. In turn, if gaps either do not exist or are not considered, the
classification benefits from weighting transversion:transition ratio
as 2:1.

Based on the successful results of this study, future work will
include large—scale application of the SOM methods using the
4DRegNear and 3DIrreg codification variants to process and topo—
logically classify large sets of nucleic acid sequences.

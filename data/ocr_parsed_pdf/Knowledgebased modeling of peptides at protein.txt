Abstract

Motivation: Protein—protein interactions (PPls) underpin virtually all cellular processes both in
health and disease. Modulating the interaction between proteins by means of small (chemical)
agents is therefore a promising route for future novel therapeutic interventions. In this context,
peptides are gaining momentum as emerging agents for the modulation of PPls.

Results: We reported a novel computational, structure and knowledge—based approach to model
orthosteric peptides to target PPls: PiPreD. PiPreD relies on a precompiled and bespoken library
of structural motifs, iMotifs, extracted from protein complexes and a fast structural modeling
algorithm driven by the location of native chemical groups on the interface of the protein target
named anchor residues. PiPreD comprehensive and systematically samples the entire interface
deriving peptide conformations best suited for the given region on the protein interface. PiPreD
complements the existing technologies and provides new solutions for the disruption of selected
interactions.

1 Introduction

Protein—protein interactions (PPIs) are essential in the shaping of
normal and pathological behaviors in cells. A new frontier in drug
discovery is, therefore, the development of new therapeutic agents
to modulate PPIs (Fletcher and Hamilton, 2006). Although origin—
ally considered undruggable, PPIs are arising as promising thera—
peutic targets as reviewed in Wells and McClendon (2007) and they
are attracting considerable attention from biotechnological compa—
nies as the ‘mzmined gold reserve’ in drug discovery (Mullard,
2012). One part of the problem is that proteins usually interact
through large and ﬂat surfaces that lack defining physicochemical
traits that can be exploited to attain the required affinities. It is
becoming clearer that chemistry originating from traditional drug
discovery programs is perhaps not the most suited for targeting PPIs
(Rubinstein and Niv, 2009), and thus new chemotypes should be
sought. It is in this context, and thanks to biotechnology advances

that have improved its pharmacokinetic properties (McGregor,
2008), that peptides are gaining momentum as emerging agents for
the modulation of PMS (Gaestel and Kracht, 2009; Marchioni and
Zheng, 2009; Rubinstein and Niv, 2009). Besides, peptide—mediated
interactions are common in Biology, accounting for up to 40% of
the interactions that take place inside the cell (Petsalaki and Russell,
2008). They are also central to number of essential cellular processes
such as signal transduction, protein assembly, protein localization
and regulation (Neduva and Russell, 2006) and thus are the more
natural candidates for the inhibition of PMS (Mullard, 2012).
Moreover, peptides do not preclude traditional chemistry as they
can be used as precursors to derive chemical compounds, i.e. pepti—
domimetics (e.g. p53—MDM2 (Vassilev et (11., 2004) and Bak BH3/
Bcl—XL (Ernst et (11., 2003).)

Computational tools can be used to model the structure of pep—
tides targeting protein interfaces. Such approaches include peptide

growing (Moon and Howe, 1991), linking (Frenkel et (11., 1995),
property—guided searches (Teixido et (11., 2003), optimization
(Roberts et (11., 2012) and docking (Donsky and Wolfson, 2011;
Raveh et (11., 2010). While useful, these technologies present a num—
ber of limitations: (i) the search is usually restricted to a small region
of the interface given the time that will be required to fully explore
the entire interface; (ii) the structure of peptides tend to be biased to—
ward linear and extended conformations as its maximized the con—
tacts with the target surface, however, peptides can adopt different
conformations including ot—helix (Kritzer et (11., 2004); (iii) do not ex—
plicitly exploit the natural repertoire of peptide sequences, which
has been proved to increase the chance to identify bioactive peptides
(Watt, 2006); (iv) some methods require the sequence of the
peptides, and thus neglecting the discovery of novel sequences; and
(v) other methods are based on the optimization of main—chain
stretches isolated from its cognate partner(s), and thus cannot be
used to explore novel conformations.

Here, we present PiPreD, a novel, structure— and knowledge—
based approach to model the conformation of peptides targeting
protein interfaces. PiPreD relies on a bespoken library of structural
motifs derived from interfaces named iMotifs and it uses
native structural elements of the interface being targeted (target—
interface), so—called disembodied anchor residues. The search and
sampling of peptides covers the entire interface, i.e. a systematic
and comprehensive exploration without biases caused by specific
location(s) of the target interface or by the conformation of peptides.
PiPreD is therefore a good complement to existing methodologies.

2 Methods

2.1 iMotistB: a collection of structural motifs

derived from protein interfaces

PiPreD is a knowledge—based approach that relies on a library of struc—
tural fragments, iMotifs, extracted from either protein—protein or pro—
tein—peptide complexes. The current library was derived from an
initial set of 45 434 complexes downloaded from the protein data—
bank (PDB) (Berman et (11., 2003) and interface residues were defined
using CSU (Sobolev et (11., 1999). Fragments containing at least two
nonsequentially continuous interface residues were qualified as
iMotifs and used to populate iMotistB. Subsequently, iMotifs were
clustered to remove structural redundancies following a similar ap—
proach as in Lessel and Schomburg (1997) resulting in a final set of
171 306 iMotifs. iMotistB is available upon request to the corres—
ponding author both as plain text or MySQL dump formats or down—
loadable from http://www.bioinsilico.org/PIPRED.

2.2 Structural modeling algorithm
PiPRED encompasses four consecutive steps described below
(Fig.1).

2.2.1 Defining anchor residues and structural diversification or
main chain rotamers

Disembodied interface residues or anchor residues are used to
drive the modeling of peptides. The anchor residues defined as those
mediating the interaction with the protein of interest, also known
as contact residues, are selected using CSU (Sobolev et (11., 1999).
The conformation of main chain atoms is then diversified by deriving
inverse rotamers, i.e. a conformational sample of main chain rotamers
with respect to a fixed position of the native contacts of the side chain
atoms. This step yields alternative conformations maximizing (and
subsequently optimizing) the number of modeled peptides.

pymol.sourceforge.net)

2.2.2 Structural modeling of peptides using iMotifs

The structural modeling is done using an adaption of our early ap—
proach to model loops in protein structures (Fernandez—Fuentes
et (11., 2006). Drawing analogies between both approaches, anchor
residues are the equivalent to stem residues in loop modeling while
iMotifs are the equivalent to loop fragments extracted form known
protein structures. In the first step of the structural modeling,
iMotifs are selected if the difference of the Euclidian distance be—
tween start—end Cot—atoms in both anchor residues and iMotifs is
smaller than 0.5 Ang (i.e. analogue to distance between stem resi—
dues and the first and last residues of the loop fragment in loop
modeling). Selected iMotifs are then superposed onto the anchor
residues using an iterative structural superposition maximizing the
number of structurally aligned residues between anchor and iMotifs.
The iteration is performed as follow: (i) it starts by aligning the main
chain and Cl)’ atoms (to preserve orientation of side chains) of an—
chors and start—end residues; the superposition is discarded if above
1.0 Ang root mean square deviation (RMSD); (ii) the nearest anchor
residue is selected if it lies within a Cot—Cot distance of 2.0 Ang to
any residue in the iMotif and subsequently added to the set of an—
chor residues in use. The fitting of iMotif—selected anchor residues is
repeated and accepted if the resulting RMSD is smaller than previ—
ous RMSD : 10%; (iii) step 2 is repeated or otherwise stops when
there are no more new anchor residues to be included or the result—
ing RMSD is above the threshold. The native main chain conform—
ation of the anchor residues and the derived inverse rotamers are
used to compute the structural superposition. All possible combin—
ations of nonstructurally equivalent pairs of anchor residues are
used to direct the modeling.

2.2.3 Computational design of peptides

The last step in PiPreD is implemented within the framework of the
Rosetta macromolecular modeling software (Leaver—Fay et (11.,
2011). Two different protocols have been implemented: the first ap—
proach follows the protocol described by Sood and Baker (2006), in
Which the main chain of peptides is fixed (i.e. main chain conform—
ations are explored at the level of iMotifs) whilst side chains are
allowed to rotate and surface residues in the target protein have lim—
ited conformational ﬂexibility (i.e. repacking). All 20 possible amino
acids are allowed at any position of the peptide with the exception
of those defined by the anchor residues where only rotameric
changes are permitted. The second approach is based on the work

by Smith and Kortemme (2010), in which structural ensembles are
generated using peptide poses by applying backrub motions to de—
rive sequence profiles. The latter is more suited to selected poses for
the purpose of generating libraries of sequences for high—throughput
screening. The peptides shown in this article as examples were
derived using Sood and Baker’s (2006) approach.

3.4.2 Scoring of peptides

In the current implementation of PiPreD, the scoring of
peptides—interface interaction is ranked using Rosetta score (Leaver—
Fay et 41]., 2011). Rosetta scoring function is a combination of
physic—based and statistical—based potentials including several terms
that account for a Lennard—Jones potential, a solvation term, orien—
tation—dependent hydrogen bond, backbone and side chain torsion
potentials, a short range electrostatic term, and an unfolded refer—
ence state (Leaver—Fay et 41]., 2013). Nonetheless, any structure—
based scoring function of choice could be equally used.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 PiPreD comprehensively charts the entire interface
during structural modeling

Protein interactions are mediated by large interaction surfaces (Lo
Conte et 41]., 1999). Therefore, targeting a protein interface using
peptides presents a combinatorial problem and thus the search is
usually restricted to a small region of the interface. However, in
PiPreD the selection of anchor residues drive the structural modeling
implemented, hence the search and sampling of peptides covers the
entire interface, i.e. it is a systematic and comprehensive exploration
without any bias both in terms of the size of the specific region of
the interface and in the conformation of the interfering peptides (see
Fig. 2 and Section 3.2). In the specific case presented in Figure 2:
Tweak in complex with the Fab fragment of a neutralizing antibody
(Lammens et 41]., 2013), PiPred delivered around 1.7 M peptides, of
which circa 650000 were helical, resulting from using 25 anchor
residues.

sented as red sphere. Top right corner, example of four different modeled
peptides depicted as cartoons (magenta, yellow, white and gold) and the
overlap between them shown in the lower right corner (Color version of this
figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

Even considering the large number of potential conformations of
the main chain of anchor residues produced by inverse rotamers, i.e.
an average of 75 alternative conformations per anchor residues, the
comprehensive charting of the interface is qualitatively better (as it
covers a large size of the conformational space restricted to the inter—
action) and faster than a random charting by ab initio modeling of
main chain conformations. Moreover, there is no need to predefine
the size of peptides and/or sequences.

On average, any given selection of anchor residues (two is the
minimum) generates on average up to 12 000 candidate iMotifs.
This number ranges between a few hundreds to tens of thousands
depending mainly on the distance between anchor residues, i.e. the
further apart, the less suitable iMotifs are found in the database. As
expected, the number of generated peptides correlates with the num—
ber of anchor residues, which in turn relates to the size of the inter—
face (Table 1).

3.2 Structural modeling generate peptides not biased
toward specific conformations

A clear advantage of the PiPreD is that the modeling process is un—
biased toward particular conformations. The modeling relies on a
structural library of iMotifs looking for the most favorable conform—
ations given the specific target—interface of a protein. Whether the
conformations would be linear/extended or helical will entirely de—
pend on the particular structural environment of the anchor residues
and the conformational ‘repertoire’ of the iMotif library.

Figure 3 shows this aspect with three particular examples of
modeled peptides. In one of the cases (Fig. 3 lower—left), the peptide
has a linear conformation, which closely resembles and recapitulates
an existing structural element of the original complex, i.e. an inter—
acting loop located in the interface. In this example, PiPreD is simi—
lar to other methods that derive peptides utilizing native regions of
the interface [e.g. (London et 41]., 2010) or (Donsky and Wolfson,
2011)]. However, the other two examples (Fig. 3 top and lower
right), the peptides present a helical conformation. This is a new
structural arrangement, not observed in the native complex, but that
however surrogates an important number of anchor residues, or in
other words, an important part of the native interface. In particular,
one of the modeled peptides can act as a surrogate of a ﬁ—strand and
a neighboring loop simultaneously accounting for up to 7 of the an—
chor residues, i.e. an important percentage of the total number of
interactions observed in the interface (Fig. 3).

This is a remarkable example in which, PiPreD yielded 1.5 mil—
lion peptide designs, where around one third had helical conform—
ation. Besides, this example also shows that PiPreD brings new
directions to the field of peptide designs. It is worth noting, that as a
lead for drug development, helical peptides are preferred to linear/
extended conformations due to higher stability, permeability and re—
sistance to proteases (Walensky et 41]., 2004).

In summary, not only PiPreD can generate peptides featuring
conformations not present in the native complex but also recapitu—
late existing, native, elements even though they are not taken into
consideration during the modeling process, i.e. anchor residues are
presented as disembodied elements.

3.3 PiPreD combines native elements of different
interfaces into single peptides

Another important feature of PiPreD is that it can integrate and
combine multiple interfaces. The only requirement for structural
modeling of peptides is the need of the anchor residues driving the
modeling. These can be extracted from a single interface or com—
bined using different interfaces, being irrelevant whether they over—
lap or not. Thus, modeled peptides can integrate anchor residues
from independent interfaces and thus reach between different re—
gions with the added value of engineering and designing de novo
interactions, which were not present in the native complex.

An example illustrating the combination of anchor residues ex—
tracted from different interfaces is shown in Figure 4. The biological
unit of the TNF—related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and
Death Receptor 5 (DR5) complex (Cha et 41]., 2000) is composed of
3 TRAIL and 3 DR5 monomers. Therefore, TRAIL monomers inter—
act both with a TRAIL and DR5 monomers (Fig. 4). To account for
this, PiPreD modeling uses the combination of anchor residues from
different interfaces. As shown in Figure 4 one for the modeled pep—
tide, a helical peptide, integrates anchor residues both from TRAIL
and DR5 monomers while reaching two different interfaces. This
has the added value of engineering and designing de novo inter—
actions, which were not present in the native complex (Fig. 4), and
thus being particularly important when looking at increasing the
number of interactions between the peptide and the protein surface.

3.4 Combining anchor residues derived from different
cognate partners

There are cases where different partners can bind the same protein
by sharing a common interface. In the context of our modeling
strategy, it means that anchor residues can be obtained from

interfaces. Cartoon representation of the crystal structure of TNF-related
apoptosis inducing ligand (gold and brown) in complex with Death Receptor
5 (cyan) (Cha er al., 2000). Modeled peptide shown in cartoon (yellow) and de
novo designed side chain and anchor residues depicted in stick representa-
tion (blue and red, respectively.) (Color version of this figure is available at
Bioin formatics on line.)

different cognate partners of the target protein and therefore they
can be merged in the modeling step. One of such example is that of
RAS, an important protein family involved in the regulation of sig—
naling pathways linked to cell grow and proliferation (Malumbres
and Barbacid, 2003), which interact with a range of protein ef—
fectors through a common interface called the switch I—II region
(Milburn et 51]., 1990).

The structures of six RAS—cognate partners were used to extract
anchor residues: RAS—p120Gap (PDB code: 1wq1) (Scheffzek et 41].,
1997), RAS—SOS—1 (PDB code: 1bkd) (Boriack—Sjodin et 41]., 1998),
RAS—RAF (PDB code: 3kud) (Filchtinski et 51]., 2010), RAS—PLC8
(PDB code: 2c5l) (Bunney et 41]., 2006), RAS—RalGDS (PDB code:
1lfd) (Huang et 41]., 1998) and RAS—Anti RAS Fv (PDB code: 2uzi)
(Tanaka et 41]., 2007). Interface sizes varies across complexes, being
SOS—RAS (Boriack—Sjodin et 41]., 1998) the complex with the largest
interaction interface, which includes 52 residues and cover and area
of around 3245 Ang2; RAS — scFV Antibody (Tanaka et 41]., 2007) is
the complex with the smallest contact surface with 17 interface resi—
dues and N900 Ang2. The target surface restricted to the intersection
of all interfaces covers an area of 1200 Ang2 and comprises 24
nonstructurally equivalent anchor residues (Fig 5). A few examples
of modeled peptides are also shown in Figure 5 and these include an—
chor residues derived from different partners. The total number of
modeled peptides was ~1.5 M, of which over 600 000 were helical
peptides.

3.5 Targeting of small interfaces and structural diversity
of peptides

Given the nature of the modeling strategy, the number of generated
peptides, and thus conformational diversity of peptides, is necessary
linked to the number of anchor residues used (Table 1). However, even
in the case of small protein interfaces, such as the case of the
Myc—Max complex (Nair and Burley, 2003), PiPreD is able to achieve
a high conformational heterogeneity among designed peptides (Fig. 6).

The interaction between Myc and Max is mediated by an ex—
tended helix—zipper and a helix—turn—helix domain. The helix—turn—
helix domain comprises 13 anchor residues distributed in a surface
of around 690 Ang2. The modeling of peptides targeting this region
generated over 550 000 peptides (over 300 000 of which had helical
conformation). As expected around 65% of the helical peptides re—
capitulate different elements of native cognate partner Max (i.e. hel—
ical peptides of different sizes and spanning different regions of
native interactions), but also and more importantly, peptides with
linear/extended conformation (i.e. conformation not observed in the
native complex) and even helical peptides whose conformation and
interaction mode was not derived from existing elements of the na—
tive complex (Fig. 6).

3.6 Targeting of independent interfaces in the same
target protein

The final example presented is the case of large protein complexes
where there can be the situation that the same cognate partner inter—
acts with two independent, nonoverlapping and structurally distant
protein interfaces. Such example is presented in Figure 7, which il—
lustrates the modeling of peptides to target ERP5 7 using anchor resi—
dues derived from Tapasin (Dong et 41]., 2009).

As shown, the two interfaces are independent and do not share a
common continuous interface of the target protein and account for
60 anchor residues in total (Fig. 7). This example is different to the
one presented in Section 3.3 as the interfaces are more distant and
do not share a common, continuous, interface of the target protein.
The number of modeled peptides, 2.5 M, was slightly lower than
expected given the number of anchor residues considered, i.e. poten—
tially one could expect a large number of combinations of pairs of
residues but an important proportion of those corresponded to an—
chor residues from different, distant interfaces (Table 1). Thus, this
caused the modeling process to fail finding suitable iMotifs to surro—
gate these particular instances.

4 Conclusion

In this work, we present a novel, knowledge—based computational
method to model and design orthosteric peptides: PiPreD. PiPreD
relies on the structural information of the protein complexes and on
a bespoken library of structural motifs: iMotistB. The residues
that mediate the interaction of cognate partner(s) and target protein,
i.e. anchor residues, are used to drive a comprehensive and system—
atic sampling and modelling of peptides derived from iMotifs.
PiPreD can be applied to any protein complex for which the three—
dimensional structure is known and thus open a new avenue to
exploit the repository of protein complexes present in structural
databases. Additionally, the technology can be easily adapted to

individual protein structures, i.e. cases where the structure of the
complex is not known, since individual aminoacids can be placed on
the surface of the target protein structure via single—residue docking
[e.g as in (Ben—Shimon and Eisenstein, 2010)]. Finally, this new ap—
proach could be used in conjunction with high—throughput peptide
synthesis techniques such as peptide microarrays to generate a pool
of sequences that are biased toward the targeted surface, i.e. a dir—
ected search as opposed to a random peptide screening.

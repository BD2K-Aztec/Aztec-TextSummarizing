Abstract

Summary: Cell differentiation processes are achieved through a continuum of hierarchical inter—
mediate cell states that might be captured by single—cell RNA seq. Existing computational
approaches for the assessment of cell—state hierarchies from single—cell data can be formalized
under a general framework composed of (i) a metric to assess cell—to—cell similarities (with or with—
out a dimensionality reduction step) and (ii) a graph—building algorithm (optionally making use of a
cell clustering step). The Since/I R package implements a methodological toolbox allowing flexible
workflows under such a framework. Furthermore, Since/I contributes new algorithms to provide
cell—state hierarchies with statistical support while accounting for stochastic factors in single—cell
RNA seq. Graphical representations and functional association tests are provided to interpret hier—
archies. The functionalities of Since/I are illustrated in a real case study, which demonstrates its
ability to discriminate noisy from stable cell—state hierarchies.

Availability and implementation: Since/I is an open—source R/Bioconductor package available at
http://bioconductor.org/packages/sincell. A detailed manual and a vignette are provided with the

 

package.

1 Introduction

Unbiased profiling of individual cells through single-cell RNA-seq
allows assessing heterogeneity of transcriptional states within a cell
population (Wu et (11., 2014). In the context of a cell population’s
differentiation or activation process, such transcriptional heterogen-
eity might reflect a continuum of intermediate cell states and lin-
eages resulting from dynamic regulatory programs. Such a
continuum might be captured through the assessment of cell-state
hierarchies, where each cell is placed in a relative ordering in the
transcriptional landscape. Additionally, statistical support should be
provided to discriminate reliable hierarchies from stochastic hetero-
geneity, arising from both technical and biological factors.

A number of algorithms have been used to assess cell-state hier-
archies from single-cell data (Amir et (11., 2013; Bendall et (11.,
2014; Buettner et (11., 2015; Jaitin et (11., 2014; Moignard et (11.,
2015; Qiu et (11., 2011; Trapnell et (11., 2014). These approaches
can be formalized under a general framework (Supplementary
Table 51). Here we present Sincell, an R/Bioconductor package
where the various building blocks of that general workflow are ex-
tended and combined (Fig. 1). Notably, Since]! implements algo-
rithms to provide statistical support to the cell-state hierarchies
derived from single-cell RNA-seq. The package is complemented
with graphical representations and functional association tests to
help interpret the results.

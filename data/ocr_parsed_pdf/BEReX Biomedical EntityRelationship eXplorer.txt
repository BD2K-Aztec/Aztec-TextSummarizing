ABSTRACT

Summary: Biomedical Entity-Relationship eXplorer (BEReX) is a new
biomedical knowledge integration, search and exploration tool. BEReX
integrates eight popular databases (STRING, DrugBank, KEGG,
PhamGKB, BioGRID, GO, HPRD and MSigDB) and delineates an inte-
grated network by combining the information available from these
databases. Users search the integrated network by entering key
words, and BEReX returns a sub-network matching the key words.
The resulting graph can be explored interactively. BEReX allows users
to find the shortest paths between two remote nodes, find the most
relevant drugs, diseases, pathways and so on related to the current
network, expand the network by particular types of entities and rela-
tions and modify the network by removing or adding selected nodes.
BEReX is implemented as a standalone Java application.
Availability and implementation: BEReX and a detailed user guide
are available for download at our project Web site (http:/ﬁ nfos.korea.ac.
kr/berex).

Supplementary Information: Supplementary methods and user
guide are available at Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

There is a good deal of biomedical databases, many of which become
community resources. However, each database has its own limitations.
First, each database covers only a small vertical domain. For example,
STRING (Franceschini et al., 2013) covers only proteiniprotein inter-
actions, DrugBank (Knox et al., 2011) and PhamGKB (Whirl-Carrillo
et al., 2012) mainly focus on drugs and diseases, STITCH (Kuhn et al.,
2012) covers only proteins and chemicals and KEGG (Kanehisa et al.,
2012) covers pathways but the coverage is small. To comprehend a com-
plex relation spanning over the different domains, users have to manually
integrate the pieces of information obtained from each database. Second,
their query capabilities are limited. For example, PharmGKB and
DrugBank provide only a single result per query, and thus users have to
manually combine the results from multiple queries to understand the
interactions. Last, the existing databases produce a static query result,
and thus users are not able to customize the result.

To address these problems, we developed a user-friendly database
integration, search and exploration tool called BEReX (Biomedical
Entity-Relationship eXplorer). BEReX has the following advantages:

(1) Reliable information: data in BEReX is reliable because BEReX
integrates data from widely used databases such as STRING,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

KEGG, PharmGKB, DrugBank, BioGRID (Chatr-Aryamontri
et al., 2013), GO (Ashburner et al., 2000), HPRD (Prasad et al.,
2009) and MSigDB (Liberzon et al., 2011), which are proven for
their utility.

(2) Integrated network: various datasets are gathered to delineate an
integrated network in BEReX. Users can see direct and indirect
relations between various types of biomedical objects drawn from
different databases.

(3) Interactive exploration: BEReX visualizes the results from a query
as a graph. Users can interactively navigate through the relations
and expand/modify the network. For example, users can ﬁnd the
shortest paths between two remote nodes; ﬁnd the most relevant
drugs, diseases, pathways and so on related to the current network;
expand the network by particular types of entities and relations;
and modify the network by removing or adding selected nodes.

(4) Generating new hypothesis: BEReX provides an environment for
allowing a user-driven approach to automatically generate plaus-
ible and/or unexpected relationships from the derived integrated
network. These plausible relationships describe potential inter-
actions or mechanisms of action between query entities and may
be used to generate a new testable hypothesis between query genes.

2 BEREX DESCRIPTION

2.1 Database integration

BEReX integrates human biomedical entity-relation information from
the eight datasets to delineate the integrated network, which consists of
46118 entities and 1126033 relations. An entity has 24.42 (standard
deviation 239.12) relations on average. A detailed explanation of the
datasets is given in the Supplementary Methods.

2.2 User interface

Figure 1 shows the BEReX user interface. Users can query BEReX for
any combination of genes, drugs, diseases, pathways, microRNAs, tran-
scription factors and gene ontology terms by using keywords. BEReX
shows the relationships among the entities matching the query keywords.
The tree View window at the top right shows the entity-relationship in-
formation of a selected node. The window below that shows the details of
a selected node or edge and provides links to external sources such as
PubMed articles that support the relation. The window at the bottom left
allows users to ﬁlter information by particular entity types, relation types
and data sources. The BEReX exploration window shows the query re-
sults in a graph. Users can interactively expand/modify the graph to
construct custom pathway networks of their interest. Finally, users can
save the current graph to a ﬁle for later use or export the graph as an
image through the ﬁle menu at the top.

2.3 Ranking method

BEReX evaluates a user query by following three steps: (i) ﬁnding the
matching (query) nodes, (ii) adding the shortest paths between the query

nodes and ﬁnally (iii) ﬁnding some extra nodes that are most relevant to the
query and augmenting the current network with them. BEReX determines
the degree of relevance based on Google’s PageRank (Page et al., 1999). In
PageRank, a node’s importance improves as the number of neighbors and
the importance of the neighbors increase. Given a query, BEReX evaluates
the PageRank scores of all neighboring nodes and shows only the top
scoring ones in the result. A detailed explanation of the BEReX ranking
algorithm is given in the Supplementary Methods.

2.4 Implementation

BEReX is implemented in Java, using JUNG (Java Universal Network/
Graph Framework) (http://jungsourceforge.net) for graph visualization
and Neo4j (http://www.neo4j.org) for graph storage and retrieval.
BEReX runs on Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems with Java
Runtime Environment 6 or later. A Cytoscape-plugin (Saito et al., 2012)
version of BEReX also will be available soon on our project Web site.

3 A USE CASE: BCR AND ABL1

The graph in Figure 1 is constructed by expanding the query
result of ‘BCR’ and ‘ABLl’. For the query ‘BCR’ and ‘ABLl’,
BEReX returns a six node graph including the two query nodes
(BCR and ABL1) and four other gene nodes (TP53, UBC, SRC
and HSP90AA1). BCR and ABL1 have a direct interaction,
as these genes are fused and drive the oncogenesis of chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML). The relationship between CML and
the two query genes can be found by expanding the query genes
with the diseases/symptoms relationship option (see user guide).
Next, by expanding the query with drugs, three components are
revealed including imatinib, dasatinib and fasudil, which interact
with BCR and ABL1. Imatinib is the ﬁrst clinically approved
drug to treat CML, as it inhibits the kinase activity of the BCR-
ABLl gene fusion (Druker et al., 2001). Dasatinib has been
approved to treat CML patients that are resistant to imatinib
(Talpaz et al., 2006).

The interactions of fasudil, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, with BCR
and ABL1 were unexpected. By clicking the edge between fasudil
and ABL1, one can see the information supporting this relation-
ship. A recent study identified Rho-kinase as the key player
in regulating the survival and transformation of BCR-ABL1
oncogenes, and showed that treating CML cell lines with
fasudil inhibits the cancer cell proliferation (Mali et al., 2011).
Furthermore, another recent article also demonstrated synergis-
tic effects in combining imatinib with fasudil in CML cell
lines (Burthem et al., 2007). This example suggests that the

PageRank-based ranking algorithm implemented in BEReX
could produce biologically relevant results and that the user-
driven approach (same as aforementioned) could generate a
testable hypothesis. The applicability of PageRank to biological
network analysis also has been reported independently by Chen
et al. (2009). They showed how PageRank can be used to priori-
tize disease candidate genes. Finally, by repeating the same pro-
cess for different entity types, a custom graph highlighting the
relationships between BCR and ABL1 with various biomedical
entities would be generated as illustrated in Figure l.

4 CONCLUSION

We developed BEReX, a user-friendly and interactive biomedical
entity-relationship exploration tool, for navigating the biological
knowledge integrated from eight well-known databases. BEReX
extracts the entity-relationships from these databases and builds a
comprehensive integrated network. By using the PageRank-based
ranking algorithm, users can incrementally build their own
custom networks through the interactive user interface. We be-
lieve that BEReX will be a useful bioinformatics tool for biologists
in exploring the complex biomedical entity-relationship networks.

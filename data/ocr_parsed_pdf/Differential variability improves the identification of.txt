ABSTRACT

Motivation: The standard paradigm in omic disciplines has been to
identify biologically relevant biomarkers using statistics that reflect
differences in mean levels of a molecular quantity such as mRNA
expression or DNA methylation. Recently, however, it has been
proposed that differential epigenetic variability may mark genes that
contribute to the risk of complex genetic diseases like cancer and
that identification of risk and early detection markers may therefore
benefit from statistics based on differential variability.

Results: Using four genome-wide DNA methylation datasets
totalling 311 epithelial samples and encompassing all stages
of cervical carcinogenesis, we here formally demonstrate that
differential variability, as a criterion for selecting DNA methylation
features, can identify cancer risk markers more reliably than statistics
based on differences in mean methylation. We show that differential
variability selects features with heterogeneous outlier methylation
profiles and that these play a key role in the early stages of
carcinogenesis. Moreover, differentially variable features identified
in precursor non-invasive lesions exhibit significantly increased
enrichment for developmental genes compared with differentially
methylated sites. Conversely, differential variability does not add
predictive value in cancer studies profiling invasive tumours or whole-
blood tissue. Finally, we incorporate the differential variability feature
selection step into a novel adaptive index prediction algorithm called
EVORA (epigenetic variable outliers for risk prediction analysis), and
demonstrate that EVORA compares favourably to powerful prediction
algorithms based on differential methylation statistics.
Conclusions: Statistics based on differential variability improve the
detection of cancer risk markers in the context of DNA methylation
studies profiling epithelial preinvasive neoplasias. We present a novel
algorithm (EVORA) which could be used for prediction and diagnosis
of precursor epithelial cancer lesions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Statistical testing in the context of large omic datasets (e.g.
mRNA expression or DNA methylation arrays) has relied on
the assumption that the most relevant features are those which
differ most signiﬁcantly in terms of their mean levels (Bengtsson
et (11., 2001). Thus, parametric testing using t-tests or regularized
versions thereof has been the standard approach for identifying
and ranking features of interest (Smyth, 2004; Tibshirani et (11.,
2002; Tusher et (11., 2001; Wettenhall and Smyth, 2004). This
paradigm of testing for differences in the means of two distributions
has been enormously successful, as demonstrated for instance
by the popularity of algorithms and R-packages such as limma
or pamr (Tibshirani et (11., 2002; Wettenhall and Smyth, 2004).
However, recent insights obtained in cancer epigenomics suggest
that identifying features that differ in terms of the second moment of
a distribution, i.e. variability, may also be as relevant or important
for understanding or predicting disease phenotypes (Feinberg and
Irizarry, 2010; Feinberg et (11., 2010; Issa, 2011; Jaffe et (11., 2012).
Indeed, it has been proposed that certain genes which are prone to
stochastic epigenetic variation, may contribute to the risk of complex
genetic diseases like cancer and that exposure to environmental risk
factors may underlie much of this stochastic variation (Feinberg and
Irizarry, 2010; Feinberg et (11., 2010). Supporting this View, a recent
study has shown that features that are differentially methylated
between cancer and normal tissue are generally also much more
variable in cancer tissue itself, suggesting that the relevant features
could be identiﬁed using the concept of differential variability
(Hansen et (11., 2011).

In this manuscript we formally demonstrate, in the context of
DNA methylation studies proﬁling precancerous conditions, that
statistics based on differential variability identiﬁes true positives
more reliably than statistics based on differential methylation. We
show how this can be attributed to the importance of heterogeneous
outlier methylation proﬁles where the outliers deﬁne a small
proportion of samples in the precancerous phenotype. Conversely,
we also demonstrate that differential variability underperforms
whenever outlier methylation proﬁles are conspicuously absent,
as is the case for invasive cancer and whole-blood (WB) tissue.
We show that the outlier features present in the early precursor
cancer lesions are more heavily enriched for developmental
genes than differentially methylated ones, underpinning their
biological importance. Finally, we incorporate the differential

variability feature selection step into an adaptive index Classiﬁcation
algorithm (Tian and Tibshirani, 2011), thus building a novel
prediction algorithm and demonstrating its added value over two
powerful Classiﬁcation algorithms that select features based only on
differential methylation statistics. We illustrate all of these results
mainly in the context of cervical cancer (CC), using four DNA
methylation datasets (a total of 311 samples, all proﬁled at 27578
CpG sites) encompassing all stages of cervical carcinogenesis.

2 METHODS
2.1 Inﬁnium 27k methylation beadchips

All samples used in this article were proﬁled using Illumina’s Inﬁnium
Human Methylation 27k Beadchips (Bibikova et al., 2009). The Beadchips
interrogate the methylation status of 27578 Cst. In all cases the data
were subject to a quality control and normalization procedure as described
in our previous work (Teschendorff et al., 2010). This procedure removes
poor quality probes and assesses the degree of technical variation compared
with biological variability using a framework based on singular value
decompositions (Teschendorff et al., 2009, 2010). Let 1' denote the CpG
and s the sample. The normalized methylation values of the Cst follow
an approximate ﬁ-valued distribution, with )3 constrained to lie between 0
(unmethylated locus) and 1 (methylated). This follows from the deﬁnition
of )3 as the ratio of methylated to combined intensity values i.e.

)3. _  (1)

m — Uis +Mis +3

where U), and Mix are the unmethylated and methylated intensity values of
the CpG (averaged over bead replicate probes) in sample s, and e is a small
correction term to regularize probes of low total signal intensity (i.e. probes
with U1: +M,;, %0 after background subtraction).

2.2 DNA methylation datasets

The four main datasets considered in this work (DataSets14) are
independent datasets. Thus, although the samples represent three different
stages in carcinogenesis, they are all from different women.

DataSet I: LBC] (48 samples) A total of 48 liquid-based cytology (LBC)
samples (all HPV+): 24 of normal histology, and 24 were CIN2+ (cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or higher). Normal and CIN2+ samples
were age-matched. This dataset is available from Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) accession number GSE37020 (to be
determined).

DataSet 2: LBC2 (48 samples) A total of 30 LBC samples (HPV negatives
and positives) with normal cytology and 18 LBC CIN2+ samples (all
HPV positive), as described in (Teschendorff et al., 2010). Normals and
CIN2+ samples were age-matched. This dataset is available from GEO
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) accession number GSE20080.

DataSet 3: CC (63 samples) A total of 63 cervical tissue samples: 48 CCs,
15 normals. Normals and cancers were age-matched. This dataset is available
from GEO (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) accession number GSE30760.

DataSet 4: ARTISTIC (ART) cohort (152 samples) All samples represent
cytologically normal cells from the uterine cervix of 152 women collected in
a nested case-control study within ARTISTIC [a Randomized Trial of HPV
Testing in Primary Cervical Screening (Kitchener et al., 2009a, b)]. Within
the nested case control study, 75 women developed a cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia of grade 2 or higher (CIN2+) within a three year follow-up
period (cases), whereas 77 women did not develop any abnormal cytology
(controls). Cases and controls were matched for age and HPV status [92 were

HPV positive (44 cases/48 controls) and 60 were HPV negative (31 cases/29
controls)]. This dataset is available from GEO (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
accession number GSE30760.

DataSets 5—7 In addition to the previous four sets, we also include two
additional DNA methylation studies encompassing relatively larger numbers
of normal and cancer epithelial tissue as well as one dataset consisting of
WB samples: DataSet 5: 23 normal breast and 113 breast cancer specimens
(Zhuang et al., 2012), DataSet 6: 23 normal endometrial and 64 endometrial
cancer samples (Zhuang et al., 2012), and DataSet 7: 148 WB samples
from healthy women and 113 WB samples from women with ovarian cancer
(Teschendorff et al., 2009).

2.3 Feature selection using differential variability

Given a feature (i.e. CpG) with DNA methylation proﬁle 5 6(0, 1)” where
n is the number of samples, differential variability tests for differences
in variability between two phenotypes. Thus, if 51 and )8; refer to the
methylation proﬁles over two phenotypes ‘ 1’ and ‘2’ , we ask if the respective
variances of 51 and 32, are statistically different or not. The standard
statistical test for testing for differential variability is known as Bartlett’s
test, or its non-parametric equivalent, the Levene test (Snedecor and Cochran,
1967). In principle, the Levene test should be preferable since it does not
assume that the data are normally distributed and indeed it is more robust
to outliers. However, in the present context, outliers are the biologically
interesting features (see later) and we seek a test that can identify differential
variability due to outliers. Hence, we here use Bartlett’s test as a means of
selecting differentially variable features where the differential variability is
driven by a potentially small number of outliers. Further justiﬁcation for this
choice is provided a posteriori by demonstrating that this indeed leads to
improved feature selection.

Let s? and s% denote the variances of phenotypes 1 and 2, and let (711,712)
denote the number of samples in each phenotype (i.e. n=n1+n2). Then,
under the null hypothesis (s? = sg), the Bartlett test statistic, B,

1+ 5 21:1 1,—_1 — m
is Xz-distributed with 1 degree of freedom, and where s2 =
Uri—2212:] (n, — 1)si2. It is from this statistic that a B-value is derived. For

convenience and interpretation, we also consider the b-statistic, deﬁned as
the log ratio of the variances, i.e. b=log{s%/s%}.

2.4 Epigenetic variable outliers for risk prediction
analysis

Epigenetic variable outliers for risk prediction analysis (EVORA) is similar
to an adaptive index prediction algorithm (Tian and Tibshirani, 2011) and is
based on the following three biologically motivated hypotheses:

0 Relevant DNA methylation features (i.e. Cst capable of predicting
disease phenotypes) may be identiﬁed more accurately by comparing
the variance in methylation between phenotypes, as proposed in
(Feinberg and Irizarry, 2010; Hansen et al., 2011). We refer to these
Cst generally as true positives, ‘risk Cst’ or ‘diagnostic Cst’
depending on biologically context.

0 Risk Cst exhibit outlier methylation proﬁles and can be identiﬁed
more accurately using differential variability. This is motivated by
the hypothesis that much of the epigenetic variation is stochastic
(Feinberg and Irizarry, 2010).

0 The cancer risk score of an individual sample is proportional to
the number of risk Cst that constitute signiﬁcant methylation
outliers (speciﬁcally hypermethylation) in that given sample. We call
these outliers, ‘methylation hits”. This proportionality assumption is
reasonable as it reﬂects the degree of deviation from normal baseline
methylation levels in the healthy phenotype.

Differential variability in cancer DNA methylation studies

 

To translate these model assumptions into a prediction tool, we need to be
able to (i) identify risk Cst and samples that constitute outliers for these
candidate risk Cst; and (ii) a statistical method for assigning risk to each
sample, and preferably one which is robust and independent of the scale used.
Scale independence is important to guarantee that classiﬁcation thresholds
are generalizable to independent datasets. To address problem (i) we propose
to transform the DNAm data matrix so that outliers can be identiﬁed in an
objective manner independently of the scale used. To achieve this, we use
the COPA (Cancer Outlier Proﬁle Analysis) transformation, which was ﬁrst
used in the context of gene expression data to identify candidate gene fusions
with outlier gene expression (Tomlins et al., 2005). Speciﬁcally, for each CpG
with methylation proﬁle )8 we transform it to a COPA-proﬁle

C _ )3, — median()§)
“ _ made”)

where s denotes the sample, and where maa1 denotes the median absolute
deviation. In other words, we subtract out the median of a proﬁle, then ﬁnd
the median of the non-zero absolute deviations, and ﬁnally divide the median
centred proﬁle by this number. Although this transformation is linear, the use
of the median and maa1 makes the transformation robust to outliers. Moreover,
the COPA-transformed values are independent of the scale used and for a
given threshold one may now deﬁne samples that constitute outliers for that
speciﬁc CpG proﬁle. Note again that because most of the Cst on the 27k
arrays map to promoters and that the great majority of these are unmethylated
in normal healthy tissue, that the interesting methylation outliers are those
which show higher methylation in the transformed phenotype. Thus, we
are here interested in samples with high (positive) COPA scores. We note
that in the case of the denser 450k Illumina arrays (Sandoval et al., 2011)
where probes are not biased to promoter regions and for which therefore
hypomethylation may play an equally important role, large negative COPA
scores would also be of interest. Thus, EVORA could be generalized to this
scenario by taking the absolute value of the COPA scores. To address problem
(ii) we propose the EVORA algorithm, which consists of the following steps.
We assume that samples can be labelled by a binary phenotype with ‘N’
labelling the normal state and ‘T’ indicating the transformed phenotype (e.g.
a prospective CIN2+, a CIN2+ or CC):

(3)

(1) Perform the COPA transformation on the whole DNAm data matrix.
Phenotype information is obviously not used in this step.

(2) Start an internal 10-fold cross-validation. Each fold consists of
splitting the samples up into a training and test set, ensuring that
training and test sets contain equal relative proportions of the two
phenotypes, and that each sample is used only once across all test
sets.

(3) Using the original ﬁ-valued data matrix, identify and rank candidate
risk Cst using Bartletts test in the training set (i.e. identify Cst
more variable in phenotype ‘T’, we call these Cst ‘hyperV DVCs’).
Perform FDR (false discovery rate) analysis to determine if there is a
sufﬁcient number of Cst passing an appropriate threshold. Typically
we require on the order of hundreds of Cst to pass an FDR < 0.05
threshold, however, the threshold may be relaxed to FDR <0.3 to
ensure this number.

(4) For each candidate risk CpG and for a range of choices of COPA
thresholds, transform the COPA methylation proﬁle to a binarized
EVORA proﬁle, in which each sample is scored as 1 (if the COPA
value for that sample is larger than the current threshold) or 0 (if the
COPA value is less than the threshold).

(5) For each sample in the test set calculate the fraction of risk Cst
which are outliers (i.e. number of 1s). This fraction is the risk index
of that sample and is dependent on the COPA threshold and on the
number of top ranked risk Cst included.

(6) Repeat Steps 375 for each fold. Thus, each sample acts as a test sample
once and is assigned a risk score.

(7) Compute the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the resulting risk
scores at each COPA threshold and for different numbers of top ranked
risk Cst (typically starting at 50 and ending at 1000 or the maximum
number obtained from Step 3).

(8) Find the COPA threshold and number of risk Cst that optimizes the
AUC over the internal cross-validation.

(9) Having identiﬁed the optimal parameters, the risk score of an
independent sample is obtained as the fraction of selected risk Cst
that have this sample as an outlier according to the optimal COPA
threshold.

We make several notes about this procedure:

(i) Having identiﬁed the optimal number of risk Cst, n*, to be included,
the exact composition of this ﬁnal list of risk Cst may be constructed
by considering the union of all sets of risk Cst obtained in the
internal cross-validation. Speciﬁcally, for the union set of such risk
Cst we count how often a given CpG is present in each run and
rank Cst according to how often they are chosen. We declare the
ﬁnal risk CpG set as the top n* of this ranked list.

(ii) Since the risk score is just the percentage of methylation hits in a
given sample, different samples may be assigned the same risk score.
To discriminate samples with tied risk scores we computed a mean
methylation score over the risk Cst using the original ﬁ-values.
The mean methylation value of each of these tied samples was then
renormalized to lie in the open interval (0.1) using the transformation
)3 —> )3 — ﬁmin /ﬁmax — ﬁmin :Fe , where e is a small offset term to ensure
that the scores lie in the open interval (i.e. values 1 and 0 are to be
excluded since otherwise this would induce ties with samples which
have neighbouring risk scores). This whole procedure therefore ranks
sarnples ﬁrst according to percentage of methylation hits and resolves
ties using a mean methylation score.

(iii) It is important to stress that the EVORA risk score is an outlier risk
score, i.e. it is derived from a scale (the COPA-scale) that allows
improved identiﬁcation of outliers. This also means that, potentially,
the optimal COPA threshold is trained on a speciﬁc type of outlier
proﬁle. Mathematically, outlier proﬁles are bi-modal (or multi-modal)
and these can be of two types: (i) proﬁles where the outlier group
is made up of a relatively small number of samples, which we call
heterogenous outliers; and (ii) more homogeneous proﬁles where the
outlier group has substantially more samples and is more similar to the
size of the normal group (i.e. the ‘N’ phenotype). Thus, if the training
and test datasets differ signiﬁcantly in terms of the type of outlier
proﬁles they exhibit, this could compromise the performance of
EVORA. In such a scenario, the COPA threshold can be transformed
back into the ﬁ-value scale, and the score in the independent sarnple
computed using this threshold on the original ﬁ-values.

3 RESULTS

Based on the insights of previous epigenetic studies (Feinberg
and Irizarry, 2010; Feinberg et (11., 2010), we hypothesized that
differential variability in DNA methylation would play a particularly
important role in the context of early carcinogenesis. Thus, to
formally demonstrate that differential variability identiﬁes more
biologically relevant DNA methylation features than statistics
based on differential methylation, we devised an objective
training/evaluation set strategy in the context of CC, a cancer
for which the cell of origin is known and for which access to
early precursor lesions is possible through routine large scale
screening programs (Kitchener et (11., 2009a, b). Speciﬁcally, we
analyzed DNA methylation proﬁles for a total of 311 samples,
including normal tissue, normal cells preceding a high-grade

cervical intraepithelial neopasia (CIN2+) (i.e. precursor CIN2+
lesions), CIN2+ samples and (invasive) CC, encompassing three
progressive stages and drawn from four independent studies (Section
2, Table 1). Thus, our strategy was to pick as discovery/training sets
those cohorts representing the two earliest stages of CC (precursor
CIN2+ and CIN2+ lesions both of which are non-invasive), and
to use cohorts representing similar or more advanced stages as
evaluation/test sets. In one context we used LBCl, consisting
of a balanced number of normal (24) and CIN2+ (24) samples,
as the discovery/training set, and used sets LBC2 and CC for
evaluation/testing. In the second context, we used the ARTISTIC
(ART) cohort representing a balanced set of normal (77) and
precursor CIN2+ (75) samples for discovery/training, and used
LBCl, LBC2 and CC as evaluation/test sets.

3.1 Differential variability identiﬁes differentially
methylated heterogeneous outlier features

Our ﬁrst task is to demonstrate that differential variability selects
a distinct but still relevant set of features, compared with ordinary
statistics (e.g. t-tests) which rank features according to the degree
of differential methylation. Accordingly, we took LBCl as our
discovery set to identify features (Cst) of interest. In one case
we used t-test P-values to rank all Cst that passed quality control
(over 23 000 of them) according to how well they could discriminate
normal from CIN2+ status differentially methylated Cst-DMCs).
In the second case, we ranked Cst according to differential
variability between the same two phenotypes using Bartlett’s test
(differentially variable Cst-DVCs) (Section 2). In both cases,
histograms of P-values and associated FDR estimation using q-
values (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003) indicated a substantial number
of Cst that were associated with CIN2+ status (Supplementary
Figure S1). Among the top 500 DMCs there was a highly signiﬁcant
skew (77%) towards hypermethylation in the CIN2+ phenotype.
Similarly, among the top 500 DVCs, the great majority (87%) were
hypervariable in the CIN2+ phenotype. Only 2 Cst overlapped
between these two lists of 500 Cst, a signiﬁcant underenrichment
[Fisher-test odds ratio (OR) = 0.18, P < 0.05], indicating that testing
for differential variability is indeed selecting different features to
those derived from ordinary t-tests. This, however, does not mean
that DVCs are not differentially methylated. Indeed, a scatterplot
of t-test P-values of the top 500 DVCs clearly showed that

many are indeed differentially methylated, albeit obviously not as
highly ranked as their t-test derived counterparts (Fig. 1A). Thus,
differential variability is selecting a different subset of differentially
methylated features. Importantly, almost all hypervariable DVCs
had positive t-statistics, meaning that they are more methylated in
CIN2+ samples (Fig. 1B). In contrast, DMCs were on the whole
less variable in the CIN2+ phenotype (Fig. 1B). The different
feature selection obtained under Bartlett’s test as compared with
t-tests can be explained by marked differences in the shapes of
the selected methylation proﬁles. Indeed, DVCs generally exhibited
an outlier structure with only a subset of the CIN2+ samples
showing increased methylation (typical increments of at least 20%)
(Fig. 1C). Thus, Bartlett’s test provides a useﬁil algorithm for
identifying Cst that exhibit a particular type of outlier proﬁle. In
contrast, and as expected, t-tests were observed to select for Cst
that showed more homogeneous differential methylation changes
(Fig. 1D).

3.2 Differential variability in precursor and
preneoplastic lesions improves the predictive value
of CIN2+ and cancer

Next, we asked which set of ranked Cst (i.e. DVCs or DMCs)
identiﬁed more true positives, deﬁned as features whose methylation
level correlates with CIN2+ status in an independent test set. Given
the signiﬁcant skew towards hypermethylation and hypervariability
in the CIN2+ phenotype, we focused our analysis on the top ranked
500 hypervariable DVCs and top 500 hypermethylated DMCs
from set LBCl. We note that the skew towards hypervariability
and hypermethylation in the transformed phenotype was observed
in almost all datasets, justifying our focus on hypervariability
and hypermethylation (Supplementary Table S1). As evaluation
set we used the independent cohort LBC2, which also consists
of normal and CIN2+ samples (Section 2, Table 1). To estimate
the strength of correlation to CIN2+ status in this test set we
used the t-statistic. We observed that the test set t-statistics of
the top 500 DVCs identiﬁed in the training set (LBCl) was
higher than the corresponding test set t-statistics of the top
500 DMCs (Fig. 2A). Given that DMCs were selected using t-
tests, it is therefore remarkable that in the evaluation set, DVCs
outperformed DMCs in terms of the t-statistic. Furthermore,
declaring a true positive feature as one with a nominal t-test P-
value <0.05 in the evaluation set, the positive predictive value
(PPV) of DVCs was almost twice as large as those of DMCs
(Table 2). Using a more stringent Benjamini—Hochberg corrected
P-value threshold of 0.05, results were robust for 4 of the 5
comparisons (Supplementary Table S2). As expected, DVCs also
showed higher b-statistics (Bartlett-test) in the evaluation set than
DMCs (Supplementary Figure S2). All these results, therefore,
indicate that differential variability identiﬁes true positives more
reliably than differential methylation, at least in the context of
preinvasive cancer lesions.

To further strengthen the case for differential variability, we
considered a third dataset (CC, Section 2), consisting of 48
CC tissues and 13 normal cervix specimens. As before, we
computed for each of the top 500 hypervariable DVCs and top 500
hypermethylated DMCs from dataset LBCl, the t-statistic in this
third set. Remarkably, once again DVCs exhibited higher t-statistics
than DMCs (Fig. 2A) and their PPV was also much higher (Table

differential hypervariable Cst in CIN2+ lesions are more likely
to be hypermethylated in CC than Cst identiﬁed on the basis
of differential methylation. DVCs identiﬁed in LBCl were also
much more variable in CC compared with normal tissue than DMCs

As another example, we considered a fourth dataset (ART,
Section 2) consisting of 152 prospectively collected cervical smear
samples, all of normal cytology at the time of sample draw.
Out of these 152 samples, 75 developed a CIN2+ within a 3
year follow-up period. Since these samples represent the earliest
stage of cervical carcinogenesis, we used this dataset as our new
training set to identify DVCs and DMCs associated with prospective

very weak genome-wide statistical signiﬁcance when using t-tests,
in contrast to DVCs which did show genome-wide signiﬁcance
levels (Supplementary Figure S3). Next, we selected the top 500

the training set. Similar to the results obtained previously, DVCs
exhibited signiﬁcantly higher t-statistics and b-statistics in all three

this, PPV values in the evaluation sets were also higher for DVCs
than DMCs (Table 2).

3.3 Improved prediction of CIN2+ and cancer status
using EVORA

To further demonstrate the importance of differential variability,
we next focused on the task of prediction. We incorporated
the differential variability feature selection step into a novel
classiﬁcation framework based on an adaptive index algorithm (Tian
and Tibshirani, 2011). We call the resulting prediction algorithm,
EVORA (Section 2). Brieﬂy, EVORA selects features (‘risk Cst’)
using Bartlett’s test for differential variability, and subsequently
assigns a ‘risk’ score to an independent sample by counting the
fraction of risk Cst which constitute methylation outliers in that
sample. A CpG constitutes a methylation outlier (or ‘hit’) in that
sample if the CpG exhibits abnormally high methylation compared
with the median value across all samples as determined by the COPA
transformation (Tomlins et (11., 2005) and a threshold parameter
(Section 2). The optimal threshold and number of risk Cst to be
included are determined by an internal cross-validation (Section 2).

We trained EVORA on the LBCl and ART cohorts, and
subsequently tested the predictions in the independent cohorts
representing similar or more advanced stages (Table 1). Predicted
EVORA risk scores in the evaluation sets were correlated to
case/control status using the AUC. To benchmark EVORA, we
compared it with a popular nearest shrunken centroid prediction
algorithm (PAMR) (Tibshirani et (11., 2002) and SPCA (Bair and
Tibshirani, 2004), which are both based on feature selection using
differentially methylation statistics. In line with our PPV analysis,
we observed that EVORA obtained higher AUC values than PAMR
and SPCA in 3 of the 5 comparisons, and in none of the 5 did it

underperform (Table 3). In several instances the differences in AUC
over PAMR or SPCA were substantial (Table 3). Heatmaps over the
DVCs selected by EVORA conﬁrmed the increased variability in
the transformed phenotypes and that EVORA risk scores correlate
with CIN2+ and cancer status (Supplementary Figure S4).

3.4 Enrichment of PRC2 target genes is stronger
among DVCs than DMCs

Next, we asked if the different feature selection due to DVCs is
reﬂected by differences in gene ontology enrichment. Since it is
known that developmental genes and in particular genes marked by
the PRC2 repressive complex [polycomb group targets (PCGTs)]
are preferentially hypermethylated in cancer relative to normal
tissue (Lee et (11., 2006; Ohm et (11., 2007; Schlesinger et (11.,
2007; Widschwendter et (11., 2007), one would expect that the same
class of genes would be equally enriched among DVCs. Indeed,
previous studies have provided evidence that developmental genes
and PCGTs are targets of increased epigenetic variability in cancer
(Feinberg and Irizarry, 2010; Hansen et (11., 2011). To test this further
in the preinvasive cancer context, we compared the enrichment OR
of PCGTs among the top 500 hypervariable DVCs and top 500
hypermethylated DMCs in each of the three studies representing the
earliest stages of cervical carcinogenesis (ART, LBCl and LBC2). In
all of them, we observed signiﬁcantly higher PCGT enrichment OR
for DVCs than DMCs (Table 4). In contrast, the PCGT enrichment
OR was similar for DVCs and DMCs derived in the CC study (CC,
Table 4). Thus, when differences in methylation are fairly large
and more homogeneous, as is the case when comparing cancer to
normal tissue (CC set) (Supplementary Figure S4), statistics based
on differential variability or differential methylation lead to a similar
PCGT enrichment.

3.5 Differential variability in invasive cancer or WB
tissue does not improve the predictive value of
cancer diagnostic markers

The improved PPV (and AUC) of DVCs derived from
precursor/preinvasive cervical cancer tissue relies on the fact that
in these early stages of carcinogenesis there are many outlier
methylation proﬁles which turn out to be of biological relevance
(Fig. 1A, C). We thus posited that differential variability would be
less useﬁil in contexts where no such methylation outlier proﬁles are
present. Speciﬁcally, this would be the case for (invasive) cancer,

Differential variability in cancer DNA methylation studies

 

because cancer is characterized by a more homogenous methylation
of CpG sites within promoters and CpG islands (see Supplementary
Figure S4). Similarly, cancer diagnostic markers derived from WB
samples do not exhibit outlier methylation proﬁles, as shown by us
previously (Teschendorff et (11., 2009) (Supplementary Figure S5).

To test our hypothesis, we collected three additional datasets
(DataSets 5—7, Section 2) encompassing relatively larger numbers of
normal and cancer tissue (Zhuang et (11., 2012), and WB tissue from
(ovarian) cancer patients and healthy controls (Teschendorff et (11.,
2009). The larger number of normal samples in these three datasets
allowed a training-test set partition strategy to be used to compare
the cross-validation statistics based on selecting either DMCs or
DVCs. In line with our expectations, the statistics associated with
DVCs were signiﬁcantly lower than those of DMCs in the WB study
(Supplementary Figure S5) as well as in the two invasive cancer
studies (Supplementary Figure S6).

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Although several studies have proposed that stochastic epigenetic
variation is an intrinsic characteristic of the cancer phenotype
(Feinberg and Irizarry, 2010; Feinberg et (11., 2010), so far only
one study has investigated the role of differential variability in
identifying cancer-associated DNA methylation markers (Hansen
et (11., 2011). Indeed, in (Hansen et (11., 2011) it was shown that
regions which are differentially methylated between cancer and
normal tissue constitute regions which are more prone to variability
in the cancer phenotype itself. However, no study has formally
demonstrated the added value of using differential variability to
identify features that may indicate the risk of a transformed
phenotype.

In this work, we ﬁll this gap by formally demonstrating that
differential variability can be used to identify more reliably
Cst whose methylation levels are associated with a transformed
phenotype. Speciﬁcally, we have shown that Cst which were
hypervariable in the transformed phenotype were more likely to be
associated with the transformed phenotype in independent datasets,
compared with Cst which were selected based on differential
methylation. We showed this in the context of two different training
sets reﬂecting two different stages of early oncogenesis. In the case
of the ARTISTIC cohort, we showed how hypervariable Cst in
precursor CIN2+ lesions were stronger indicators of CIN2+ status
and CC in independent datasets. Similarly, hypervariable Cst in
CIN2+ samples were also stronger predictors of CIN2+ and CC
status in independent cohorts. In this context, it is remarkable that
features which were selected using t-tests had lower t-statistics in the
evaluation sets than features which were selected using differential
variability. This last result attests to the importance of differential
variability in the early stages of carcinogenesis.

It is important to point out, however, that differential variability
may not improve the identiﬁcation of relevant markers in other
contexts. Indeed, we have seen that the identiﬁcation of cancer
diagnostic markers derived from studies proﬁling invasive cancers
(a more advanced stage of carcinogenesis) does not beneﬁt from
considering differential variability. Similarly, using differential
variability to identify cancer diagnostic markers from WB tissue
also yielded a reduced predictive value. We can attribute the reduced
performance of DVCs in these speciﬁc contexts to the fact that
methylation outliers play a less ﬁindamental role in the more

advanced stages of an epithelial cancer or, in the case of WB,
that cancer diagnostic markers reﬂect small changes in the blood
cell type composition (Teschendorff et (11., 2009). In these contexts,
statistics based on differential methylation are entirely appropriate
because the associated methylation proﬁles in the transformed
phenotype exhibit a much more homogeneous type of bi-modality,
an assumption which is implicit when using, e.g. t-statistics. In
contrast, the relevant methylation proﬁles in the earliest stages of
cancer are characterized by outlier proﬁles, where the bi-modality
and hypervariability are driven by a relatively small number of
samples in the transformed phenotype, and we have seen that in this
context differential variability not only improves the sensitivity of
detecting such markers, but that it also improves the predictive value.
Attesting to the biological importance of DVCs, we also observed
that these were signiﬁcantly more enriched for PCGTs than DMCs,
and we note that this result too was restricted to the two earliest
stages of cervical carcinogenesis.

In this manuscript, we also incorporated the concept of differential
variability into a novel prediction algorithm called EVORA.
EVORA uses differential variability to select features, and then
uses an adaptive index algorithm over these features to assign
a risk score to independent samples. Comparison of EVORA to
two popular and powerful classiﬁcation algorithms that are based
on differential methylation statistics (PAMR, SPCA), showed that
EVORA performed favourably in predicting CIN2+ and cervival
cancer, further conﬁrming the higher predictive power of DVCs over
DMCs. Once again, this improved performance is restricted to the
situation where the training is done in either precursor or established
CIN2+ samples, representing the earliest stages of carcinogenesis.

It is important to emphasize that feature selection using
differential variability is the key reason why EVORA compares
favourably to prediction algorithms like PAMR or SPCA. Indeed,
the relative PPVs obtained (Table 2) are in line with the relative
AUC values (Table 3), indicating that the precise construction
of the risk score is of less importance. Indeed, we have veriﬁed
that an alternative construction of the risk score using an average
methylation over the hypermethylated DVCs leads to a very similar
AUC performance (data not shown). Although there are many
other alternative statistical procedures one could use to compute
the risk score, we have here advocated a construction that is
based on a linear scale transformation (COPA) (Tomlins et (11.,
2005) of the CpG methylation proﬁle. The COPA transformation
is robust to outliers, thus allowing a more objective framework
in which to identify these. A further compelling reason for
using the COPA framework, however, is that it easily allows for
hypervariability associated with either hyper or hypomethylation. In
fact, whereas methylation outliers associated with hypermethylation
would exhibit large positive COPA scores, outliers associated
with hypomethylation would exhibit large negative scores. Thus,
EVORA could be easily extended to optimize a threshold over
the absolute COPA scores, with the resulting risk score effectively
counting both hypermethylated as well as hypomethylated outliers.
The EVORA risk score could therefore be interpreted as an
‘epigenetic instability index’, a notion which has proved useful in the
context of predicting clinical outcome in cancer DNA methylation
studies (Zhuang et (11., 2012). Nevertheless, in this manuscript
we have focused on features which become hypermethylated and
hypervariable in the transformed phenotype. This is justiﬁed by our
observation that in the discovery/training sets there were substantial

skews towards hypermethylation and hypervariability. This skew
may reﬂect the choice of the Inﬁnium 27k methylation platform
where most Cst are located within promoters, which are usually
unmethylated in the normal physiological state. It will therefore be
interesting to explore if differential variability can also improve the
detection of biologically relevant DNA methylation markers in the
context of hypomethylation. To address this, however, will require
denser methylation arrays [e.g. the 450k Inﬁnium methylation
platform (Sandoval et (11., 2011)] where probes are much less
biased to promoter regions. Thus, although the EVORA algorithm
implemented here is mainly aimed at 27k studies, or studies that wish
to restrict to promoter regions, EVORA could be easily generalized
as explained above to include differential variability associated with
hypomethylation, and therefore we envisage that EVORA will also
be useful in the context of 450k arrays.

Although the insights presented here have been obtained in the
context of mainly one cancer (CC), it is very likely that they will
generalize to other invasive neoplasias and perhaps also to other
complex genetic diseases. In this regard, it is worth pointing out
that CC is the only epithelial human cancer where the normal cell
of origin is easily accessible in large numbers as part of routine
screening programs. Since differential variability only appears to
play an important role in the early stages of carcinogenesis, it would
therefore be challenging to demonstrate its added value in the context
of other cancers, since for most other cancers the cell of origin or
precursor cancer cells are either unknown or not easily accessible in
sufﬁciently large numbers.

In summary, we have shown that differential variability can be
used to signiﬁcantly improve the sensitivity and detection of cancer
risk in DNA methylation studies. Statistics and algorithms based
on this novel paradigm of differential variability will undoubtedly
play a major role in large-scale epigenome wide studies proﬁling
epithelial preneoplastic tissues.

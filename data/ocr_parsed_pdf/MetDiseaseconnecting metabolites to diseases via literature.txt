ABSTRACT

Motivation: In recent years, metabolomics has emerged as an ap-
proach to perform large-scale characterization of small molecules in
biological systems. Metabolomics posed a number of bioinformatics
challenges associated in data analysis and interpretation. Genome-
based metabolic reconstructions have established a powerful frame-
work for connecting metabolites to genes through metabolic reactions
and enzymes that catalyze them. Pathway databases and bioinfor-
matics tools that use this framework have proven to be useful for
annotating experimental metabolomics data. This framework can be
used to infer connections between metabolites and diseases through
annotated disease genes. However, only about half of experimentally
detected metabolites can be mapped to canonical metabolic path-
ways. We present a new Cytoscape 3 plug-in, MetDisease, which
uses an alternative approach to link metabolites to disease informa-
tion. MetDisease uses Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) disease
terms mapped to PubChem compounds through literature to annotate
compound networks.

1 INTRODUCTION

A wide range of pathway mapping and visualization tools have
been developed for the analysis of transcriptomics, proteomics
and metabolomics data. They provide a quick and intuitive way
to place experimental data into the context of prior biological
knowledge. Most of the existing tools for the analysis of meta-
bolomics data rely on genome-based metabolic reconstruction
databases (Frolkis et al., 2010; Garcia-Alcalde et al., 2011;
Karnovsky et al., 2012; Xia and Wishart 2011). Metabolic recon-
struction databases such as KEGG (Kanehisa, 2006), BioCyc
(Caspi et al., 2012; Romero et al., 2005) and their subsequent
refinements (Caspi et al., 2012; Duarte et al., 2007; Hao et al.,
2010; Kanehisa, 2006; Ma et al., 2007; Sigurdsson et al., 2010;

Thiele et al., 2013) provide carefully curated information about
metabolic pathways, metabolites, metabolic reactions, enzymes
and the genes that encode them.

Recent progress in the ﬁeld of metabolomics now allows rapid
and quantitative measurement of hundreds of named metabolites
and thousands of chromatographic features representing add-
itional metabolites. As the experimental data analysis methods
improve, metabolomics has increasing potential to provide in-
formative readouts of metabolic changes in a variety of diseases
(Sreekumar et al., 2009; Urayama et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011;
Wisloff et al., 2005; Yap et al., 2010). However, biological inter-
pretation of metabolomic experiments is hindered by relatively
low coverage of experimentally identiﬁed metabolites in pathway
databases. In fact, most metabolic reconstructions cover the ma-
jority of primary metabolites, whereas the coverage of lipids,
secondary metabolites and volatile metabolites is signiﬁcantly
lower (Barupal et al., 2012). Additional reasons for low metab-
olite coverage include the presence of metabolites from different
organisms (e. g. presence of bacterial metabolites in human sam-
ples originating from microbiome), drug metabolites and com-
pounds of environmental origin, few of which are contained in
most pathway databases.

To explore the possibility of expanding metabolite annotation
through biomedical literature, we have developed Metab2MeSH
(http://metab2mesh.ncibi.org), which links PubChem com-
pounds to MeSH terms via substances that are annotated to
PubMed articles (Sartor et al., 2012). National Library of
Medicine (NLM) provides a list of chemical substances that con-
tain a wide range of synonyms used in biomedical publications
that can be linked to the compound synonyms used in PubChem.
Using the compounds and their occurrences in PubMed litera-
ture, statistical tests were performed to estimate the signiﬁcance
of the associations between compoundiMeSH descriptor pairs.
The resulting associations, supporting data and literature are
stored in a relational database and can be accessed via
Metab2MeSH web interface and web services. However, incor-
porating these annotations into data analysis workﬁow remains
a challenge.

To further demonstrate the utility of Metab2MeSH data set
and provide a quick and easy way to annotate metabolic net-
works, we developed MetDisease, a plug-in for the open-source
tool Cytoscape [29] that uses disease-related MeSH terms. Users
can import and annotate any network where metabolites (com-
pounds) are represented as nodes, referenced by KEGG or
PubChem IDs. The edges can be arbitrarily deﬁned by the

users. MetDisease allows users to highlight and explore parts of
metabolic networks related to one or more MeSH disease terms
and provides links to relevant PubMed literature. Users have an
option to import their own metabolic networks or to use
MetDisease to annotate metabolic networks generated with the
Cytoscape plug-in Metscape (Karnovsky et al., 2012). Both
use cases are illustrated below.

2 METHODS

MetDisease uses the Metab2MeSH database (Sartor et al., 2012). This
dataset is created twice a year by downloading the PubChem Compound
and Substance databases and the NLM PubMed database, parsing them,
and loading them into an in-house relational database. Associations be-
tween compounds and MeSH terms are calculated using 2-sided Fisher’s
exact tests, and any results with P<0.0001 are retained in the database.
MetDisease then uses an internal service to access this database via SQL
queries to determine relevant MeSH disease terms for the compounds in a
given metabolic network.

3 RESULTS

To illustrate the use and features of MetDisease, we created a
network using a publicly available metabolomics dataset
(Krumsiek et al., 2012). A subset of known metabolites was
downloaded from Supplementary Data (GGM.xlsx). Partial cor-
relation coefﬁcient values <5e-4 were used to draw the edges in
the resulting network (See Supplementary Data File). Once the
network was loaded to Cytoscape, we used MetDisease to iden-
tify MeSH disease terms associated with compound nodes as
shown in Figure 1.

Once the network has been loaded, users can select
MetDisease from the Cytoscape Apps menu. When the Filter
Options dialog box appears, users are prompted to select an ap-
propriate identiﬁer (KEGG or PubChem ID) and the column in
their input ﬁle that contains that identiﬁer. After the mapping
has been completed, the Disease branch of the MeSH tree is
displayed. The MeSH terms that have mapped compounds in
an active network are shown in bold. Users have an option to
hide unmatched terms. By right clicking on the node of interest,
users can access PubMed publications as shown in Figure 1, or
identify other MeSH terms related to the compound of interest
by going to the Metab2MeSH web application.

Another characteristic feature of MetDisease is the ability to
annotate metabolic networks generated by Metscape
(Karnovsky et al., 2012). A use case where a glycine metabolic
network generated by Metscape was annotated using
MetDisease is shown in Supplementary Figure Sl, where sarco-
sine has been appropriately linked to prostatic neoplasms.

In conclusion, MetDisease provides a quick convenient way to
identify compounds associated with a disease term, and identify
publications that link them together. Just like the underlying
Metab2MeSH data set, because of its dependence on what is
in the literature, MetDisease is not meant to predict novel asso-
ciations. However, as the examples illustrate, it is a useful tool
for identifying disease associations that would otherwise be dif-
ﬁcult to find.

Importantly, because the associations are not derived from
genome-based metabolic reconstructions, MetDisease can be

Fig. 1. The network was constructed using metabolites reported by
Krumsiek et a]. as nodes and partial correlation coefﬁcients as edges
(see network ﬁle in Supplementary Data). MetDisease plug-in was used
to annotate the metabolites with MeSH disease terms using PubChem
IDs. When a MeSH term is selected in the lower panel (e.g. Brain
Neoplasms highlighted in blue), the metabolites that were mapped to it
are selected in the network [in this case 12 (yellow) compounds are se-
lected]. Numbers to the right of the term indicate the number of mapped
metabolites in the active network. By right clicking on the node of interest
(e.g. glycine), user can access the publications in PubMed that substanti-
ate that connection

used to annotate a broader range of compounds, including
drugs, nutritional compounds and environmental toxins.

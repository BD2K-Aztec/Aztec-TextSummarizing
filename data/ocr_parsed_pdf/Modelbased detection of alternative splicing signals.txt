ABSTRACT

Motivation: Transcripts from ~95% of human multi-exon genes
are subject to alternative splicing (AS). The growing interest in AS
is propelled by its prominent contribution to transcriptome and
proteome complexity and the role of aberrant AS in numerous
diseases. Recent technological advances enable thousands of exons
to be simultaneously profiled across diverse cell types and cellular
conditions, but require accurate identification of condition-specific
splicing changes. It is necessary to accurately identify such splicing
changes to elucidate the underlying regulatory programs or link the
splicing changes to specific diseases.

Results: We present a probabilistic model tailored for high-
throughput AS data, where observed isoform levels are explained
as combinations of condition-specific AS signals. According to our
formulation, given an AS dataset our tasks are to detect common
signals in the data and identify the exons relevant to each signal. Our
model can incorporate prior knowledge about underlying AS signals,
measurement quality and gene expression level effects. Using a
large-scale multi-tissue AS dataset, we demonstrate the advantage
of our method over standard alternative approaches. In addition, we
describe newly found tissue-specific AS signals which were verified
experimentally, and discuss associated regulatory features.

1 INTRODUCTION

The proper function of a living cell depends on constant regulation
of its biomolecular content, both spatially and temporally. One
important regulated process is splicing, where exonic segments
of the transcribed pre-mRNA are spliced together while intronic
segments are removed. In some cases, different exons of the pre-
mRNA may be retained, leading to different transcripts called
isoforms, a process known as alternative splicing (AS). There are
several known types of AS, with the most common one being
cassette AS (Wang et al., 2008), illustrated in Figure 1A. AS plays a
critical role in shaping how genetic information is expressed in cells
of metazoan species. Moreover, 15—50% of human disease mutations
affect splice site selection (Wang and Cooper, 2007). Recent high-
throughput sequencing studies estimate that transcripts from ~95%
of multiexon human genes undergo AS, with the majority of AS
exons displaying differential expression across different tissues
(Fan et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008). Such high-throughput studies
can be probed to identify condition-speciﬁcl splicing changes that

subsequently can be linked to genetic disease (Scheper et al.,
2004). Alternatively, groups of exons identiﬁed by these studies as
exhibiting concerted changes across functionally related conditions
(e.g. muscle tissues) can be used to look for a common regulatory
program. For example, several works (Castle et al., 2008; Fagnani
et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008) correlated splicing changes with
potential binding motifs. Recently, Barash et al. (2010) developed a
computationally derived regulatory code that includes combinations
of motifs and non-motif features such as transcript structure
characteristics to directly predict splicing changes from genomic
sequence. The focus of the work presented here is to facilitate
such downstream analysis by accurately identifying biologically
informative condition-speciﬁc splicing changes, or AS signals,
underlying high-throughput measurements.

High-throughput AS measurements are typically acquired using
microarrays or high-throughput sequencing technologies. Accurate
quantiﬁcation of every isoform still poses computational and
experimental challenges. Consequently, much of the research
involving AS and derived datasets focuses on the simpler task of
quantifying splicing changes at the single exon level. Such data can
be quantiﬁed as the fraction of gene isoforms including an exon,
with additional information conveying the overall gene expression
level in each condition (Fan et al., 2004; Shai et al., 2006). This
representation is not only easier to derive, but also corresponds
well to the hypotheses accounting for regulated AS. The regulatory
mechanisms involved include various structural features and cis
elements in the proximity of the alternative exon, with splicing and
transcription forming two distinct networks of regulation (Hartmann
and Valcarcel, 2009; Wang and Burge, 2008).

Formally, the measurements from high-throughput AS studies can
be represented as a matrix whose entries convey the fraction of
inclusion and exclusion isoforms for each of the exons and each
of the conditions monitored in the study (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the
overall expression levels of the genes containing each exon can
be represented by a corresponding matrix. A widely used approach
for identifying common patterns in such data is clustering (Eisen
et al., 1998; Segal et al., 2004). Clustering the columns of the matrix
derived from Fagnani et al. (2007), containing ~3700 cassette exons
proﬁled across 27 mouse tissues, easily identiﬁes a cluster of all
central nervous system (CNS) tissues, evident on the left side of the
clustergram in Figure 1C. Similarly, clustering rows of the matrix,
which represent AS proﬁles of exons, identiﬁes groups of exons that
share a similar AS proﬁle across conditions.

While readily available and easy to apply to AS datasets, standard
clustering methods such as hierarchical agglomerative clustering
and K -means clustering, suffer from several drawbacks. First, many
splicing changes occur in functionally related conditions, such as
CNS or muscle tissues. Standard clustering is not easily modiﬁed so
as to incorporate such prior knowledge. Second, a splicing change

in a subset of conditions may involve two types of effects, one
being a relative increase of exon inclusion levels and the second
being a relative decrease. Common distance measures used for
clustering either distinguish between these two effect types or
ignore the difference between the two (e.g. correlation and absolute
correlation coefﬁcients). In practice, however, it is desirable to be
able to distinguish between these two types of effects, but still
associate them since they may share common regulatory elements.
For instance, splice factors such as Nova, Fox and (n)PTB have been
linked to both effects in the same tissues (Ashiya and Grabowski,
1997; Boutz et al., 2007; Minovitsky et al., 2005; Ule et al., 2006).
Third, another characteristic of AS datasets not easily incorporated
into standard clustering methods, is that exons may exhibit a
combination of splicing changes in several functionally related
tissue groups, such as muscle and CNS (Zhang et al., 2008), but
occurrence of regulated splicing changes across cellular conditions
is expected to generally be sparse. This expected sparsity is related
to the experimental setup, where thousands of exons are monitored
but most of these do not exhibit condition-speciﬁc proﬁles. Fourth,
previous work has shown that while some exons exhibit a type of
on/off splicing proﬁle, others exhibit continuous splicing changes
across tissues, and may have different tissue-independent baseline
inclusion levels. A closer look at the clustering results (Fig. 1D),
illustrates the problems that arise from the inability to easily
incorporate these domain characteristics into standard clustering.
Exon 2 of Pank3 and exon 10 of Arfgapl are an example of two

exons positioned on opposite ends of the clustergram, despite both
exhibiting a proﬁle containing a splicing change in CNS tissues.
Exon 2 of Pank3 and exon 3 of NM_029530.2 are positioned far
apart since their baseline levels of inclusion are distinctly different,
but both exhibit a similar pattern of increased inclusion in CNS.
The Pank3 exon also exhibits increased inclusion in muscle tissues,
yet it is positioned adjacent to exon 3 of Fgf1, which exhibits an
unrelated splicing proﬁle. Switching to different similarity measures
[e. g. from the default L1 norm used here to Pearson’s correlation, or
mean squared error (MSE)] or between clustering algorithms, may
help address some of these problems, but does not offer an overall
solution to the issues raised.

Matrix factorization algorithms, such as principal component
analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA) and singular value
decomposition (SVD), offer an alternative approach for analyzing
high-throughput AS measurements. Following the terminology
of SVD previously used for this task (Wang et al., 2008),
these algorithms are able to identify a set of C 3T underlying
‘eigen-exons’ (termed ‘components’ in PCA and ‘factors’ in FA),
and assign to each exon in the dataset a matching set of values
that represent how much each of these eigen-exons contributes
to a given exon AS proﬁle. This approach is thus more naturally
suited for modeling AS measurements as continuous combination
of components, where each component can have either a positive
(increased inclusion) or negative (increased exclusion) effect, and
with different magnitude. However, these algorithms still lack

some basic elements needed to properly model AS. For example,
it is not obvious how to incorporate prior knowledge about the
domain (e.g. groups of related experiments) or possible noise in the
measurements. Speciﬁcally, some measurements are more likely to
be noisy because a gene is insigniﬁcantly transcribed in a certain
tissue, or suffers from low read coverage. In addition, since sparsity
is not enforced in many of these algorithms, they can account
for an AS proﬁle using small amounts of many eigen-exons, and
such contributions are usually meaningless in terms of underlying
condition-speciﬁc regulation.

We propose a probabilistic model for high-throughput AS
measurements that stems from signal processing and FA (Rubin and
Thayer, 1982). In this framework, given a dataset, our objective is
to identify what are the underlying AS signals that together explain
the observed data, and what combination of those make up each
of the observed exon AS proﬁles. Our generative model treats the
observed AS proﬁle of an exon as a vector of random variables which
is the result of a combination of underlying (hidden) condition-
speciﬁc AS signals. Each AS signal, just as the eigen-exons in SVD,
is a vector across the experimental conditions. However, unlike in
standard matrix factorization, the multiplicative factor modulating
the contribution of each AS signal to each exon is modeled by
an assignment to a random variable that can come from three
different distributions: the ﬁrst distribution corresponds to the signal
being ‘off’ (i.e. contributes nothing to the AS proﬁle), while the
other two distributions represent the signal being ‘on’ or ‘reversed’,
corresponding to the signal contributing to differential inclusion or
exclusion, respectively. We include a sparse prior favoring the ‘off’
state to reﬂect the fact that most exons monitored in high-throughput
experiments are not expected to exhibit condition-speciﬁc splicing
changes. In addition to the AS signals, our generative model also
includes a competing background model. Whether an observed
measurement was generated by the signal or the background model
is determined by the assignment of a matching binary noise variable,
which is generally unknown (i.e. hidden). However, when additional
information is available, such as the overall expression level of the
exon’s gene in that condition, we incorporate it into the model to
increase or decrease the posterior belief that speciﬁc measurements
came from the background model.

We derive an algorithm to efﬁciently learn the proposed model
given a high-throughput AS dataset. Performing inference in the
learned model, one can identify which combination of signals make
up the AS proﬁle of each exon monitored, or test exons not included
in the original study. The result of such analysis is illustrated in
Figure 1E and F. Three of the identiﬁed signals in Figure 1E
correspond to previously known splicing changes in CNS, muscle
and embryo tissues, while the last signal corresponds to a tissue-
independent signal that captures the (hidden) baseline inclusion
level. One tissue-speciﬁc signal is a novel signal representing
splicing changes in digestive tissues identiﬁed by the algorithm.
As we discuss later, this signal was not discovered by alternative
methods but was supported by a predictive model derived from
putative regulatory features followed by experimental testing of
the model’s predictions (Barash et al., 2010). The combinations of
these ﬁve AS signals used to account for the AS proﬁles of the four
exon examples of Figure 1D are shown in Figure 1F. We see that
exon 3 of Fgf1 was correctly identiﬁed as including the signal for a
change in embryo tissues set to ‘on’, the three other exons correctly
identiﬁed to include the CNS tissues signal set to either ‘on’ or

‘reverse’, and exon 2 of Pank3 was also found to include the signal
for muscle.

In the following section, we provide more indepth details of the
model and the algorithm used to learn it. In the results section, we
discuss the AS signals identiﬁed and experimental veriﬁcations of
exons exhibiting those signals. Then, we demonstrate the advantages
of our model, both quantitatively and qualitatively, over the related
SVD method and over manually deﬁned AS signals, two approaches
previously used for this task (Castle et al., 2008; Fagnani et al., 2007;
Wang et al., 2008). We ﬁnish the results section relating the AS
signals identiﬁed to a compendium of known regulatory features
we compiled, brieﬂy reviewing some of the mechanistic insights
suggested by our analysis before concluding with a discussion of
related work and future directions.

2 METHODS

The input data includes two matrices. one for AS measurements {xi} 6
[0,1]. giving for each exon 26 {1,...,E} and condition [6 {1,...,T} the
estimated fraction of isoforms that include the cassette exon. and the second
matrix. {vf} ER representing the estimated log-abundance of each exon’s
corresponding gene in each condition. We term the vector x" =x‘l’, . . . ,x; the
AS proﬁle of exon 2. In our probabilistic framework. the AS proﬁle is a vector
of random variables x=x1,...,xT. and an observed AS proﬁle of an exon
(x9) is an instantiation of it. According to our generative model. an observed
AS proﬁle is a result of an unknown combination of a set of unknown
components. or AS signals {135:1 where lo is a vector over the measured
conditions Ao,1,...,Ao,T. where log, ER. We know from previous studies
(Castle et al.. 2008; Wang et al.. 2008) that splicing changes across conditions
may occur at different levels of magnitudes. Accordingly. the contribution
of each signal lo depends on a multiplicative factor. modeled by a matching
random variable mo 6 R. To reﬂect the fact that each AS signal (e. g. inclusion
change in CNS tissues) may contribute to an observed AS proﬁle either
positively (increase inclusion) or negatively (increase exclusion). and that
most exons surveyed in such high-throughput datasets are not expected to
exhibit a condition-speciﬁc splicing proﬁle. we use a mixture distribution for
the magnitude modulation variable mo. The class of this mixture distribution
is represented by a ternary random variable so. and corresponds to three
components: so = 0 which means the signal is absent (mo 5 0) . so = +1 and
so = —1 which imply positive (mo > 0) or negative (mo < 0) contributions of
the matching signal lo. To summarize. we have:

P(Xfwsewme) = P(SE)P(me|Se)N(xf:chlmiwiﬁz), (1)

0:]

where N denotes a Gaussian with variance tlrt. To reﬂect the fact that
most exons are not expected to exhibit condition-speciﬁc AS proﬁles. we
use a sparse prior where Vc P(so :0) >> P(so = :l:1). When an AS signal is
absent (so=0) we have mo set to zero. For cases where an AS signal is
present (so = :l:1) we use P(mo |_so)=N(mo; vo, yo) and initialize it with vo =
:l:4, yo = 1.2 to avoid situations where s: 75 0 (indicating a change in splicing).
but the magnitude of the change is close to zero. We note that while
the Gaussian assumption carries the beneﬁts of mathematical tractability
for the derivations that follow. it is not ideal for modeling a distribution
over a random variable conﬁned to a ﬁnite range. However. we stress
that the marginal distribution P(xf) as deﬁned above is actually a mixture
distribution. with the assignment so determining the mixture component.

 

2In FA. changing either vo or yo of mo prior distribution have the same effect
on the model’s likelihood as the magnitude of the signal multiplied by mo is
absorbed by the values of the matching lo.

The assignments to those mixture variables in turn determine which exon
exhibits each of the inferred AS signal.

Exons surveyed in high-throughput experiments tend to have varying
baseline inclusion levels. Indeed. when performing SVD analysis of AS
data the ﬁrst and most prominent signal identiﬁed is a tissue-independent
signal (Section 3). To model this we incorporate into the model a signal 13
that is forced to be used in the positive sense in all cases (i.e. s2=+1,Ve
with mg~N(vB,]/B). initialized using vB=4,yB= 1). This is the ﬁfth AS
signal depicted at the bottom of Figure 1E. While the exact value of 13 is
updated during learning. the mg variable guarantees varying magnitudes of
this baseline signal to appear in the AS proﬁle of each exon.

Next. we incorporate into the model gene expression levels and possibly
other knowledge about the experiments. Intuitively. if a gene is not expressed
in a speciﬁc cellular condition 1 then a corresponding entry xf for one of its
exons should be ignored. In practice. either biological factors (e. g. low gene
expression) or technical ones (e.g. non-speciﬁc hybridization or ﬂuctuations
in read coverage) usually lead us to ascertain higher or lower conﬁdence
to measurements. We assume additional measurement information such as
gene expression levels is given as a matrix {vi} and generally vf ER. To
utilize this information. our generative framework contains alongside the
signal model a competing background or outlier model. A hidden binary
variable n, indicates whether each observation xf was generated from the
signal model (nf = 0) or from the background model (nf = 1). Formally:

P(xe , me , se , v9) = HP(s:)P(m:|s:)

(2)

If prior knowledge about the quality of the AS measurements. given by P(vf |
nf). is not available. we simply set P(n,=1) to a low value. indicating
low outlier probability. More details on how setting P(vf |nf) using gene
expression information are given in Supplementary Material.

Gene expression levels have an additional role. besides guiding the model
to assign higher or lower conﬁdence in the AS measurements. Speciﬁcally.
high gene transcript levels correlate with skipping of alternative exons.
possibly because of ‘kinetic coupling’ (Kornblihtt. 2007) where changes
in the rate of transcriptional elongation in turn affect the timing in which
splice sites are presented to the splicing machinery. To account for this
phenomena we include an additional signal in our model. based on the
expression measurements. Unlike other signals in the model (or in standard
matrix factorization). this signal is not learned but determined directly from
the expression values of each exon’s corresponding gene. We therefore
denote it 1‘1}. where A?” 2 vi, 1 E {1, . . . , T}. Since in this case the modulation
levels may be positive or negative (corresponding to a positive or negative
correlation with gene expression) and some may be relatively small. we
set the distribution over it to be P(mv)=N(mV: vV=0,yV) and learn the
variance yv.

To summarize. the addition of a baseline and expression signals Via the
m1, and my modulation variables imply that the condition-speciﬁc AS signals
identiﬁed by the model and their assignments to the various exons are
inferred after tissue-independent inclusion level and gene expression effects
are accounted for. The resulting model can be represented as a Bayesian
network (Fig. 2). with the model elements that are shared with standard FA
denoted by a dashed line. Compared with FA. the model includes four major
changes outlined above: the addition of a separate baseline and expression
signal; the introduction of a mixture distribution over the factor modulation
variable mo Via a matching so variable to enforce sparse signal activation with
either positive or negative effects; and the addition of a competing outlier
model with gene expression or other experimental information serving as
noisy sensors for it. Via the {n,} variable set.

2.1 Learning the model

Given input data {xf} and {vi}. the objective of our probabilistic generative
framework is to learn the model parameters O={lo,1lr,,yo,vB,]/v,u,,¢,}
that maximize the likelihood of the data. We develop an efﬁcient learning
algorithm. based on generalized expectation maximization (EM). to optimize
a bound on the likelihood termed free energy (Neal and Hinton. 1998).
Similar to standard FA and independent factor analysis (IFA) (Attias. 1999)
(and unlike SVD/PCA that are optimized analytically). convergence to the
global optimum is not guaranteed. We therefore follow the learning algorithm
description with a review of how it can be effectively initialized and directed
to ﬁnd good solutions. Finally. we review how the free parameters that control
the number of AS signals C and the sparsity of those P(so) can be set.

The structure of the graphical model in Figure 2 illustrates the
computational complexity of running standard parameter learning and
inference methods given the data. since the dependency between s 2 s1 , . . . , sc
and n=n1,...,nT makes such inference intractable for moderate values of
T and C. We therefore use a variational approximation (Neal and Hinton.
1998) for the joint posterior distribution Q(s"’,m",n") given the observed
inclusion levels x" and additional data V":

P(s",m"’,n"’|x",v")%Q(s",m",n")=

C T (3)
= (Qrsimmz:n:,.rz:,>)1‘[Q<ni>.
6:1 [:1
where 712,0; are the variational parameters governing the posterior
distribution over the modulation assignments. Given this variational
approximation. learning a maximum likelihood model is done using an
EM-like iterative procedure. We defer additional technical details to the
Supplementary Material. and only note that for the results presented in the
following sections. the learning procedure converges to a set of parameters
that deﬁne the AS signals (given by {lo}) and that the posterior belief that a
given exon’s AS proﬁle x" includes a speciﬁc signal as either ‘off’. ‘on’ or
‘reversed’. is given by Q(s§) with so E {0,+1, —1} in the above equation.

As is usually the case with EM-based learning algorithms. it is imperative
to initialize the model parameters properly. When there is no prior
knowledge. we create a random initialization point by setting lo to the
average AS proﬁle plus independent Gaussian noise with variance equal
to the AS proﬁle variance. Similarly. p. is initialized to the average tissue
proﬁle. while \11 and (D are initialized to the variance of the AS proﬁles. In
addition. to avoid poor local minima for a given training set. we repeat this
procedure N times and select the model with the highest likelihood (N = 50
in the experiments described below).

Finally. we describe how the model’s free parameters can be set. We
employed a standard approach of cross-validation to test how well different
model settings do on train and test data. The most crucial parameter to set

is C . the number of underlying AS signal assumed to comprise a given
dataset. We evaluate different values for C in the following section. For the
signal sparsity prior P(so). we wanted the model to avoid assigning AS signal
with low values and therefore used the following preprocessing. Initial SVD
analysis identiﬁed the well-known AS signals for CNS. muscle and embryo
tissues (Section 3). with the cumulative distribution over the singular values
associated with these signals typically shaped like a sigmoid. Consequently.
we set the prior P(so = :l:1) at 0.08 to reﬂect the probability mass of both
edges of this sigmoid. The AS signals identiﬁed and their assignments to
exons were not sensitive to changes (:l:0.05) to these settings as long as
sparsity was maintained (data not shown).

2.2 Setting signals using biological knowledge

An additional beneﬁt of the model-based approach described here is
that speciﬁc initialization points and model constraints can be easily
incorporated. These initialization points or model constraints can be used
to reﬂect prior biological knowledge about the underlying AS signals
in the data. While the uninformed initialization scheme described above
works generally well (Section 3). several reasons may lead researchers
to prefer biologically directed solutions. First. learning such solutions
may be computationally efﬁcient. leading to quick convergence and
avoiding excessive numbers of random restarts. Perhaps more importantly.
our generative model ultimately serves as an approximation for the
physical process that yielded the observed measurements. As such. there
may be several solutions the model can converge to. with some that
are biologically plausible yet quite different. For these reasons. as we
demonstrate in Section 3. it is beneﬁcial to have the ability to use different
biologically directed and undirected settings. exploring the space of possible
solutions.

To direct the learning algorithm toward a certain solution for the AS
signals. we use the following procedure: for any subgroup of conditions T’ C
{1,...,T} corresponding to a known signal we initialize a matching signal Ao
so that signOtoJ) = signOLoJ/ ) Vt, t’ E T’, while log, = 0 Vt E T’. If this is a good
solution in terms of the likelihood surface. the learning algorithm can quickly
converge to a similar solution in the neighborhood of this starting point. As
we later show. we can also initialize a subset of the signals in such a way.
and learn the rest of the signals using random initializations. Alternatively.
we can constrain the model so that log, = 0 Vt E T’ and learn only the subset
of the parameters {Aogt},VtET‘. If we use only such constrained signals.
this is equivalent to inferring the contribution of AS signals from predeﬁned
condition groups. along with the baseline inclusion level. We note. however.
that unlike many clustering and bi-clustering algorithms. even in such a
constrained scenario. each condition t may be included in more than a single
AS signal. and for a speciﬁc signal 0, the contribution of the conditions T’
that deﬁne it need not be the same. The advantage of this modeling ability

3 RESULTS

We used the dataset of Fagnani et al. (2007), comprising 3707
cassette exons measured across 27 mouse tissues to evaluate
our computational method. The condition-speciﬁc AS signals,
corresponding to splicing changes in CNS, muscle, embryo and
digestive tissues, are shown in Figure 1 . The error bars for the signals
were derived by randomly sampling subsets containing 80% of the
original data. The four tissue-speciﬁc AS signals identiﬁed were also
supported by a recent work where splicing changes corresponding to
these four signals where predicted directly from genomic sequence

and veriﬁed experimentally using RT-PCR experiments (Barash
et al., 2010).

3.1 Comparison to alternative approaches

The comparison to alternative computational approaches for signal
extraction includes two main parts: the AS signals identiﬁed, and
their assignment to exons. Computational alternatives can be broadly
divided into two subgroups: supervised and unsupervised. The
supervised approach is based on prior knowledge of condition
groups (e.g. CNS tissues) and is executed by computing a statistic for
each exon such as the difference between its mean inclusion level in a
predeﬁned group of conditions compared with all the others. The set
of exons for which the inclusion levels in these groups deviates the
most are subsequently assigned the AS signal matching these groups
(Castle et al., 2008; Fagnani et al., 2007). The second, unsupervised,
computational alternative includes clustering algorithms discussed
in Section 1, and variants of matrix factorization.

We start by comparing the identiﬁed AS signals. For the
supervised approach, comparing the three major AS signals
corresponding to splicing changes in CNS, muscle and embryo
tissues is not particularly informative as the signals are both
known and highly robust (see below). However, it is important to
note that the supervised approach can only be applied to signals
that are already known. Unless additional exploratory analysis is
performed, this approach cannot detect unknown signals such as
those corresponding to splicing changes in digestive tissues or in
two subgroups of CNS tissues described below.

Matrix factorization algorithms, such as SVD, PCA and FA,
are implemented in various software packages and represent the
second alternative approach for AS signal extraction. We term this
approach ‘unsupervised’ since, unlike the ﬁrst approach described,
the underlying signals are not set in advance. For comparison, we
focused on SVD, which was recently applied to this task (Wang et al.,
2008). In SVD, the input matrix of observed inclusion levels X is
decomposed so that X = USVT. The diagonal matrix S contains the
singular values, ordered by magnitude, while the rows Vk represent
‘eigen-exons’. SVD guarantees that for any C frank[X] using only
the ﬁrst C components of the matrices U ,S , VT produces a matrix
X C that is the closest, by MSE, to X from all rank C matrices. This
can be given a probabilistic interpretation when assuming a ﬁxed
Gaussian noise model for the observations.

Figure 3 shows the results of SVD analysis. Based on the
magnitude of the singular values (Fig. 3A), we included in
subsequent analysis the ﬁrst six eigen-exons. The ﬁrst and by far
most dominant singular value (119.2), corresponds to a tissue-
independent eigen-exon, while the following ﬁve eigen-exons,
denoted E1,...,E5, are shown in Figure 3B. SVD clearly retrieves
CNS, muscle and embryo AS signals represented by the ﬁrst three
eigen-exons. To test how robust the signals identiﬁed by SVD
are, we performed the following procedure: we created ten subsets
containing 80% of the data, then computed the pairwise correlation
between the signals identiﬁed for each of the 10 data subsets. The
pairwise correlations between the ﬁve eigen-exons derived for each
of these data subsets are plotted as a heat-map in Figure 3C. The ﬁrst
three eigen-exons, matching splicing changes in CNS, muscle and
embryo tissues, were highly robust but the fourth and ﬁfth signals
were less clear (Fig. 3B). Over the 10 data subsets, the fourth and
ﬁfth eigen-exons contained various combinations of tissues with at

least one always having a strong peak in testis. The testis tissue,
which is a clear outlier in this dataset, also appeared in other eigen-
exons, such as the muscle one (E3) depicted in Figure 3B. This
result is probably due to the fact that SVD analysis, based on a
uniform Gaussian noise model and no additional modulation, is more
sensitive to outliers.

Next, we evaluated the quality of the signal assignments to
exons. When analyzing real-life high-throughput data, the correct
assignment of signals to exons is generally not known. We
therefore deﬁned an independent measure for the quality of the
signal assignment, termed the feature information index (FII). In
short, the FII measures the enrichment of previously reported
regulatory elements in groups of exons assigned a speciﬁc AS signal
(e.g. splicing changes in CNS tissues). See Supplementary Material
for more details. The rational behind the FII measure is that a
better deﬁnition of a set of exons as those that exhibit splicing
changes in certain conditions should consequently lead to ﬁnding
higher enrichment levels within this exon set of elements known to
regulate splicing in these conditions. We note that the algorithms
only had access to AS and expression measurements; thus, the FII
can serve as an independent quality measure. Moreover, the FII may
also be indicative of the quality of further downstream analysis of
high-throughput AS datasets, as many of the works producing these
datasets subsequently try to identify the regulatory elements and
underlying mechanisms that govern condition-speciﬁc AS.

Our model allows the assignment of signals to exons by setting
a threshold that represents high conﬁdence according to the signal
posterior Q(sg) deﬁned in Section 2. In the case of SVD, each column
vector U C deﬁnes an ordering over the amount each eigen-exon
c contributes to each exon. Similarly, for the supervised approach

in a predeﬁned condition group (e.g. CNS tissues) and the rest
also deﬁnes an ordering over the exons. However, both of these
computational alternatives have no built-in method to set a threshold
for signal assignments. In order to avoid biasing the FII measure
due to differences in group sizes, we therefore used the orderings
of these methods deﬁned over exons for each AS signal to create
groups of the same size as our model deﬁned. Speciﬁcally, in the
experiments described we used a conﬁdence threshold of Q(sg) 3 0.9
to deﬁne both the exons that had a signal (so = :l:1) or did not have it
(so = 0). Changing the threshold to 0.99 yielded similar results (data
not shown).

The results of the FII evaluation are summarized in Figure 3D.
Only CNS and muscle tissue groups are shown as these are the
only tissues for which a substantial knowledge of condition-speciﬁc
cis regulatory elements is currently available (see Supplementary
Material for details). SVD and the supervised method gave similar
results, while our method scored signiﬁcantly higher for both signals.
The similar performance of SVD to the manually constructed tissue
groups is to be expected in this case as both matching eigen-exons
are dominated by these tissue groups, and SVD uses a ﬁxed MSE
model to assign those to exons. In contrast, our modeling approach
identiﬁed the same two AS signals but is able to reject noisy
measurements and assign signals to exons with varying degrees of
splicing changes due to the modulation factor.

3.2 Evaluation of model settings

We start the evaluation of the model settings by addressing the
most prominent question of how many AS signals are we able
to identify in the data. We employed a train and test procedure,
randomly choosing 80% of the exons for training, and keeping the
other 20% for testing. Figure 4 shows the effect of increasing the
number of underlying AS signals C in our model, where the baseline
is a simple model containing only two tissue-speciﬁc AS signals, a
tissue-independent signal (23) and the expression-dependent signal
(AV). Error bars were derived by repeating the above procedure
10 times. As expected, when the number of signals increases, so
does the time it takes for the algorithm to explore the search space
and converge (Fig. 4A). While the free energy keeps dropping for

the training set, for test data we see a clear saturation effect after
reaching ﬁve signals.

Since the algorithm converges during learning to a speciﬁc set
of signals that represent a local optimum in the search space, a
highly related question is how robust are these signals. In one
extreme, convergence to very different solutions under slight data
perturbation that make no biological sense would indicate a problem
in the modeling approach or with the ability to overcome local
minima, while, on the other hand, consistent convergence to a single
solution would suggest a distinct global optimum under the modeling
assumptions. To test the robustness of the identiﬁed signals, we
repeated the same procedure that we used for evaluating SVD,
using the same 10 randomly chosen subsets containing 80% of
the original data. For each subset we learned the AS signals, then
computed the pairwise correlation between the signals. Figure 5
shows a heat-map for the pairwise correlations between all AS
signals learned under different settings of the algorithm. The tested
settings include either four or ﬁve tissue-speciﬁc signals, using
random initialization and initializing the model to include three
known AS signals corresponding to splicing changes in CNS, muscle
and embryo tissues. In general, we found that randomly initialized
runs always converged to solutions that included CNS, muscle and
embryo signals, sometimes slightly combined. The best scoring
solutions had distinct CNS, muscle and embryo signals, with a split
between the CNS tissues sometimes occurring when learning either
four or ﬁve signals (Fig. 5D, left panel). This split may represent
a novel distinction, in terms of AS signals, between two subgroups
of CNS tissues: one that is dominated by spinal cord and hindbrain
and another that is dominated by striatum and cortex.

When the model was initialized with three AS signals
corresponding to known splicing changes in CNS, muscle and
embryo tissues, the algorithm convergence was highly robust for
all 10 data subsets (Fig. 5C). We note that in this setting the ﬁrst
three signals were only initialized to these tissue groups but not
held ﬁxed. Moreover, the initialization for the fourth signal was kept
random as we had no prior knowledge for additional signals, yet the

algorithm consistently converged to it given the other settings. The
four tissue-speciﬁc signals the algorithm converged to are shown
in Figure 5D. These signals match with those shown in Figure 1,
where we also included the variance of the signals. We noticed
that adding additional random restarts to several data subsets that
originally converged to a different set of signals, eventually yielded
this set of AS signals, implying this may be a slightly better solution
and possibly a global optimum for these data subsets too. Taken
together with the other results, we conclude that while the search
space of the algorithm contains many local optima, all of these
include a combination of CNS, muscle and embryo signals. The
ability to switch between directed and undirected exploration of
the search space was beneﬁcial for the analysis of the data, with
the undirected search identifying one local optimum that includes
a distinction between two groups of CNS tissues and the directed
search leading to a more stable solution that includes a novel splice
pattern in digestive tissues veriﬁed by direct experiments.

Next, we tested the effect of modeling each measurement as
generated from either the AS signals or a competing background
model, with a posterior belief derived from the observed gene
expression levels. Compared with an uninformative sparse noise
prior, the derived AS signals remained similar but convergence time
was reduced by 30%. This moderate effect was probably due to the
fact that only ~1 1% of the measurements in the data of Fagnani et al.
(2007) were suspected as noise based on expression values; thus,
using this prior allowed the algorithm to converge more quickly but
had little effect on the actual result. We suspect the noise prior may
play a more critical role in cases where a larger portion of the data is
expected to be noise (see Supplementary Material for an example).
We also tried varying the sparsity of the signal prior (P(so =:l:1)),
within a :l:5% range, with no substantial effect in terms of the
signals identiﬁed or their assignment to exons. Standard FA, where
sparsity of the signals is not enforced, gave similar results to the
SVD analysis described before (data not shown).

3.3 Regulatory features associated with AS signals

While not being the main focus of this work, we conclude this
section with a review of the correspondence between the AS signals
we identiﬁed and known regulatory elements included in the FII.
In general, we found excellent agreement between our results and
previously reported ones. Nova YCAY motifs were found to be
enriched mostly in the downstream introns of exons associated
with increased inclusion in CNS and mostly downstream of exons
downregulated in those tissues. Some of the more distant regions
enriched in Nova motifs were also identiﬁed (Ule et al., 2006).
Fox motif variants ([U]GCAUG) were associated with inclusion
in muscle and to lesser extent brain tissues when appearing in the
downstream intron, and mostly with exclusion in those tissues when
in the upstream intron. However, this motif was correlated with
a general change in exon inclusion in those tissues, indicating a
reversed effect too, a result in accordance with a recent study (Zhang
et al., 2008). CU-rich motifs known to bind (n)PTB were found to
be highly enriched both up-and downstream of exons exhibiting
splicing changes in several tissue groups, most prominently CNS.
This result is inline with (n)PTB known role as a derepressor in
CNS tissues and its ability to loop across relatively short exons,
as in the well-studied case of src N1 (Chan and Black, 1997). An
interesting result involved the Quaking-like motif ACUAAY, which
was previously reported enriched downstream of exons exhibiting

increased inclusion in muscle (Das et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008).
We not only identiﬁed this enrichment, but also an enrichment
upstream of exons exhibiting splicing changes in CNS, which is
in line with known roles of this class of splicing factors in neuronal
disease mutations.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work we presented a model-based approach to identifying
condition-speciﬁc AS signals from high-throughput data. Unlike
other approaches, our generative model is speciﬁcally tailored for
this task. It incorporates prior knowledge about AS, including known
correlation to expression levels, modeling of a tissue- independent
signal, the expected sparsity of the AS signals and the fact that AS
signals may have either a positive or negative effect. The model is
also able to incorporate speciﬁc knowledge about a given dataset,
including information about the quality of the measurements, related
gene expression levels and knowledge of speciﬁc AS signals in the
data. We compared our approach with commonly used alternatives
and showed that on real data it was able to produce superior
results in terms of the signals identiﬁed, their robustness and their
assignments to biologically important groups of exons. For the latter,
we deﬁned an independent measure of quality, the FII, performed a
literature search for tissue-speciﬁc splicing regulatory cis elements,
and showed that the assignment of AS signals by our method
correlated signiﬁcantly better with those elements. Our method was
able to detect a novel split of the signal for splicing changes in
CNS tissues into two separate subgroups of tissues, and a previously
unreported AS signal associated with digestive tissues. The four
main tissue-speciﬁc AS signals identiﬁed by our model are supported
by a predictive model derived from putative regulaotry features,
including experimental testing of the model’s predictions (Barash
et al., 2010).

Previous work developing related models include IFA and another
form of a mixture of factor analyzers (Attias, 1999; Ghahramani
and Hinton, 1996). Both of these models, developed for different
applications, differ from ours in the mixture model used and do not
include domain-speciﬁc elements, such as the background model,
the gene expression levels and the AS baseline signals. More recent
work involving general matrix factorization algorithms include
the work by (Dueck et al., 2005), which was applied to gene
expression data and Robust PCA (Candes et al., 2009), which
involves sparse signal assignments and noisy data. In general,
the computational alternatives currently available can be broadly
divided into two: supervised and unsupervised methods. The ﬁrst
mostly consists of computing statistics such as the mean inclusion
level for a predeﬁned group of conditions, while the other includes
clustering methods such as hierarchical agglomerative clustering,
as well as SVD, PCA and other variants of matrix factorization
algorithms. Compared with those, our modeling approach can
range between supervised and unsupervised signal identiﬁcation,
depending on the amount of additional information incorporated
into the model. We were able to demonstrate the usefulness
of this trade-off between search space exploration and prior
knowledge exploitation for the identiﬁcation of AS signals in the
data.

There are several direct computational extensions to the model
presented here. One extension involves deﬁning the number of
components in the model as a random variable and marginalizing

over it. A recent work by (Paisley and Carin, 2009) implemented
such a model for factor mixtures using a beta process prior. We
note though that in our context we are not simply interested in
marginalizing out the component number, since the identity of the
AS signals and the exons associated with them are biologically
meaningful. Another possible direction for future work is to replace
the Gaussian mixture components used in our model with alternative
distributions that would ﬁt the data better. This change would be of
practical use if the better ﬁt to the data would also lead to more
accurate signal assignments to exons.

We brieﬂy reviewed some of the regulatory elements we identiﬁed
as enriched in groups of exons associated with the AS signal
reported. Many of these are in excellent agreement with previously
published results, including the role and positional bias of cis
element known to bind Nova, PTB and Fox. Some identiﬁed
features, such as the Quaking motif upstream of exons highly
included in CNS, offer possible insights to additional regulatory
mechanisms.

The correlation between signals identiﬁed by our model and
regulatory elements points to possible extensions and applicative
potential of the modeling approach we propose. Our probabilistic
framework can naturally be extended to a uniﬁed framework
where combinations of regulatory features are used to explain
identiﬁed AS signals and the assignment of these signals to exons
is subsequently used to reﬁne the regulatory programs learned.
Such a uniﬁed approach for modeling regulatory programs has
been applied successfully in other domains (Bar-Joseph et al., 2003;
Beer and Tavazoie, 2004; Segal et al., 2002, 2003). In our recent
work (Barash et al., 2010), the model described here was utilized
to construct a regulatory code that predicts tissue-speciﬁc splicing
changes directly from genomic sequence. Our framework can be
extended to incorporate additional information such as secondary
structure elements, nucleosome positions and splice factor binding
measurements (Licatalosi et al., 2008), to gain further insights into
the underlying regulatory mechanisms associated with each AS
signal.

Based on the analysis of AS signals we report and the comparison
of our method to standard computational alternatives, we believe this
work will facilitate the study of future high-throughput AS datasets,
extending our understanding of the transcriptome complexity.

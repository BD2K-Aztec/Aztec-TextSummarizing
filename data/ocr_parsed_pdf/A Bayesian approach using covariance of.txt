ABSTRACT

Motivation: Quantifying differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD)
between sub-groups can highlight genetic regions or sites under
selection and/or associated with disease, and may have utility in
trans-ethnic mapping studies.

Results: We present a novel pseudo Bayes factor (PBF) approach
that assess differences in covariance of genotype frequencies from
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from a genome-wide
study. The magnitude of the PBF reflects the strength of evidence
for a difference, while accounting for the sample size and number of
SNPs, without the requirement for permutation testing to establish
statistical significance. Application of the PBF to HapMap and
Gambian malaria SNP data reveals regional LD differences, some
known to be under selection.

Availability and implementation: The PBF approach has been
implemented in the BALD (Bayesian analysis of LD differences)
C++ software, and is available from http://homepages.lshtm.ac

1 INTRODUCTION

Comparing linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns between groups,
such as cases and controls or sub-populations, can provide an insight
into genetic regions under selection and/or association with disease.
In fact, comparisons between different ethnic groups may be used
to calibrate the resolution of association using trans-ethnic mapping
(McKenzie et al., 2001), as well as indicate the appropriateness
of genotypic imputation using sequence data from a reference
(HapMap) panel. A number of approaches have been suggested
for quantifying LD differences. Haplotype sharing methods (Te
Meerman and Van der Meulen, 1997; Thomas et (11., 2003; Tzeng
et (11., 2003) are usually applied in a case—control setting, where
it is assumed that pairs of cases would tend to be more Closely
related than pairs of controls, while case—control pairs would be even
more distantly related on average. Such approaches isolate regions of
interest using pairwise comparisons of lengths of haplotype sharing

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

(Bourgain et (11., 2001; Wang et al., 2006), they can be generalized
to compare different sub-populations, and use U -statistics and
permutations to determine statistical signiﬁcance. Other methods
compare the matrices of pairwise LD metrics (e.g. r2 and D’) of
different sub-populations. In particular, they calculate differences in
the eigenvalues (and eigenvectors) (Krzanowski, 1993; Teo et al.,
2009; Zaykin et al., 2006), and perform permutations to determine
statistical signiﬁcance thresholds. Here, we present an alternative
approach that does not require permutations and is based on analysis
of covariance of genotype frequencies. We propose a Bayes factor
statistic that quantiﬁes the degree to which covariance matrices
from sub-populations are different. We compare our method with
an eigenvalue difference (EVD) approach, and apply it to data from
the HapMap (The International HapMap Consortium, 2007) and a
subset of controls from a genome-wide association study (GWAS)
of malaria in a Gambian population (Jallow et al., 2009).

2 METHODS

AssumeX and Y are allele counts for 17 SNPs. which are individually binomial
distributed. When the number of individuals (n) is large (as in a GWAS).
the multivariate central limit theorem implies the Gaussian distributions
ymx—ng—wmzx) and yn—y(7—ny)—>N(0,2y), where u and )3,
are mean vectors (length [7) and covariance matrices (dimension p X [7)
respectively. and Y and 7 are the sample means. Suppose we wish to test the
hypothesis that the covariances are the different (H 1 : EX 75 2y) versus that
they are the same (H0 : EX 2 2y 2 EXJ). To do this in a Bayesian framework.
we simply specify two models for the data. one which assumes that the
samples have a common covariance and the other where two covariances are
needed. We then calculate the posterior probability under the two models.
assuming equal prior probabilities of the models.which is directly related
to the Bayes factor. the ratio of the marginal likelihoods. In other words.
we compare the model in H0 :Pr(X, Y) versus that in H1 :Pr(X)Pr( Y). More
explicitly the Bayes factor is given by

Pr(X~ Yluxwuy)

Pr(X|Mx)Pr(Y|m/)

Kass and Raftery (1995) suggest a framework for interpreting the magnitude
of a Bayes factor and, therefore, the level of evidence against H0. For
Gaussian distributed data (X, Y) it is convenient to adopt the conjugate prior
for the covariance E, which is the inverse-Wishart distribution (Gelman
at al., 2003), speciﬁcally,

n(2|d,D)=Iw[d,D]|E_I|_(‘I+1’+I)/2exp{— EtaDE—U} (2)

where d is a shape scalar, D the p X p inverse scale matrix, tr refers to the
trace of a matrix and Iw[d,D] the normalizing constant,

lDld/2

I . d,D =—.
"I I 2"P/21‘,,(d/2)

The Wishart distribution is the sampling distribution of the matrix of
sums of squares and products, and is the multivariate analogue to the X2
(Gelman at al., 2003). We say that 2 follows an inverse Wishart distribution,
if 2‘1 follows a Wishart distribution. An inverse-Wishart distribution is a
ﬂexible representation (Gelman at al., 2003), and it is possible to modify
the off-diagonal elements of D to incorporate knowledge of regions (single
nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPS) with high LD. Assume Z is the grouped
data ofX and Y {X, Y}, with mean #2 and covariance 22. In this case, (1)
can be calculated in closed-form, and where Z ~N(p.z, 22) with prior 22 ~
inverse-Wishart(a1 ,D) we have,

and the normalizing constant Iw[a,A] has the same form as above. Our
algorithm may be summarized in the following steps:

1. Centre the genotype data by subtracting the sample means for each
SNP (ft): X<—X—;lx and Y <—Y—)ly.

2. Group data Z = {X , Y} and calculate the logarithm of (3).

3. Calculate the logarithm of (3) for X and Y separately, where n is
replaced by n), and ny (the number of observations or individuals for
X and Y), respectively.

4. The log pseudo Bayes factor (PBF) is the difference of Step 2 minus
the sum of individual factors in Step 3.

We describe PBF as a pseudo-metric as we rely on various assumptions,
such as the equality of the priors and the asymptotic properties for
allele counts. More, negative PBF values [greater denominator in (1)]
provide greater evidence of a difference in the covariance of genotypes
in the sub-populations. Here, we specify the prior parameters in the
Wishart(2|a1 ,D]) in a default way, namely d :17 (the number of SNPs) and
D21 (the identity matrix). Although, our PBF implementation is robust
to covariance matrices that are improper or with negative eigenvalues, we
suggest that SNPs with high levels of missing genotypes (e.g. > 10%) and
very low minor allele frequency should be removed from the analysis, in
keeping with other genome-wide analysis approaches (Jallow at al., 2009).
In addition, it is also advisable to remove any SNPs that deviate signiﬁcantly
from HardyPWeinberg equilibrium (e.g. HWE P < 10‘7), as it may be due to
poor genotype calling (J allow at al., 2009). It makes sense to restrict the test
to a window of markers and unless otherwise stated, we consider windows of
50 SNPs in our analyses. We compare the PBF to a simple haplotype sharing

method (HAPS) that considers in each population, the average number of
common alleles across the window of SNPs between all pairwise haplotypes
(Tzeng at al., 2003), and then calculates the absolute difference between
populations. We also compare our approach to a metric based on comparing
EVDs [similar to Krzanowski (1993) and Teo at al. (2009)] between sulk
population matrices of pairwise directional r2 (Teo at al., 2008) values.
Speciﬁcally, if we assume that these matrices calculated for 17 SNPs are
T] and T2 in sub-populations 1 and 2, respectively, and noniimproper, then
symmetric matrix T) can be decomposed into T‘iAiT‘iT (1': 1,2), where 1",» is
orthogonal and A,» diagonal. The EVD is the sum of the absolute values of
A1 — A2.

3 SIMULATION STUDY

The coalescent simulation package MS (Hudson, 2002) was used
to generate haplotypic data for a 250kb region assuming an
effective population size of 10000 and a constant mutation rate
(p) of 2.0><10_8 per generation per base pair. We considered
two levels of LD reﬂecting different uniform recombination rates
(crossover rate r per generation per site): (i) high LD (r=0.5 ><
10T8) and (ii) low (r=2.0 >< 10T8). We generated genetic data for
two sub-populations, assuming their haplotypes were from: (i) the
same population; (ii) two different populations; and (iii) where one
sub-population is a random sample of haplotypes from the two
different populations, and the other sub-population consists of a
75:25 mixture of haplotypes from those populations. Genotypes
were constructed from the haplotypes, and we considered two
sample sizes (n=60250, identical in each sub-population) and two
different SNP densities (p = 50100). We calculated the EVD, HAPS
and PBF values for 2000 replicates of each scenario. The results are
presented in Table 1. Decreasing LD leads to lower HAPS, EVD
and absolute PBF values. When there are differences in LD, the
PBF metric is strictly negative, and its magnitude is greater with

Table 1. The HAPS, EVD and PBF metrics with corresponding 95%
credibility regions; the scenarios correspond to identical sub-populations
(No), where one sub-population consists of 25% and 75% of the haplotypes
of two populations and the other sub-population is a random sample from
the two populations (some), and where the haplotype structure in each sub-
population is completely different (yes); we assume a constant mutation rate
of 2.0 X 10‘8 per generation per base pair, and a uniform recombination rate
of 2 X 10‘8 (low LD) and 0.5 X 10‘8 (high LD) per generation per site.

increasing sample size and numbers of SNPs genotyped in that
region. The haplotype similarity metric (HAPS) is greatest where
there is a difference between populations, as the number of SNPs
increase, and when there is greater LD. Because the EVD metric is
based on summary statistics, it should be less dependent on sample
size. However, pairwise LD metrics are more robust with larger
sample sizes (Teo et (11., 2009). Interestingly, for the lesser sample
size, the EVD credibility regions overlap for the no difference and
completely different scenarios. In general, the EVD approach could
be applied to windows of SNPs, and the data may be normalized
using the mean and SD of the windows in that region (Teo et (11.,
2009). Irrespective of whether there are LD differences we observed
a negative correlation between the PBF and EVD values (median:
high LD —0.1 1, low LD —0.13), and PBF and HAPS absolute values
(median: high LD —0.02, low LD —0.03). We found our results
robust to minor Changes in the speciﬁcation of the prior distributions,
particularly when altering the scale parameter (1 (values p:l:0.1p).
Overall, our results suggest that the PBF appears competitive with
EVD and HAPS methods, with the advantages that being fully
probabilistic it can be combined directly with other prior information
and is directly comparable across genetic regions.

4 HAPMAP AND GAMBIAN SNP DATA

We now explore the use of the PBF on real genetic data. Using
HapMap Phase II genotypic data (The International HapMap
Consortium, 2007), we calculated PBF values between pairwise
groups of individuals from: (i) Utah with European ancestry (CEU
parents, 11 = 60), (ii) Han Chinese from Beijing (CHB) and Japanese
from Tokyo (JPT) (ASIA, n: 90), and (iii) Yoruba people from the
Ibadan region in Nigeria (YRI parents, 11:60). We also compared
these populations to a set of controls from the self-reported Jola
ethnic group (n: 90) from a Gambian case—control study of severe
malaria (Jallow et (11., 2009), genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K
Chip. Our approach captured some genes that have previously
been shown to exhibit strong signatures of positive selection. We
investigated 20 autosomal candidate regions that have previously
been highlighted as being under natural selection (Sabeti et (11.,
2007). Table 2 summarizes the minimum PBF (and maximum EVD)
values for these 20 autosomal candidate regions. In 15 regions, we

observe evidence (P < 0.05) of an LD difference using PBF; where
the P-value is calculated by perrnuting the data under the null and
recording the distribution of resulting PBF statistics. Our results
are broadly similar to the EVD approach, though we note that one
of the regions of strongest selection (Chr 17: 53.3 Mb) as detected
by PBF was not declared as signiﬁcant using EVD (P =0.095). In
Figure 1a, we plot the LD across ASIA and YRI populations across
this candidate region on Chromosome 17 (53086—53837 kb). The
PBF has detected a Clear extended block of LD within YRI relative
to the ASIA samples. In Figure 1b, we show the LD plot for a region
known to be under strong selection (Chr 2: 136.1 Mb) containing
the LCT gene, and was identiﬁed by the PBF as being signiﬁcant
(P = 0.001).

Fig. 2. The lowest 0.5% of PBF values between pairwise comparison of
populations across the genome. The mean (SD) PBFS for CEU versus ASIA
(CA) 566.5 (228.5), ASIA versus YRI (AY) 18.4 (222.0), CEU versus YRI
(CY) 118.9 (180.0), CEU versus Jola (CJ) —933.7 (180.7), ASIA versus Jola
(AJ) —1271.9 (238.9) and YRI versus Jola (YJ) —868.1 (185.4).

We then investigated the locations of the lowest 0.5% of PBF
values for each pairwise population comparison, resulting in 1028
regions (192 overlapping between population comparisons, median
size 483 kb, 3812 genes) (Figure 2). The majority of hits are enriched
for genes related with immune response, reproduction, olfaction,
morphology and metabolism (using gene ontological categories),
consistent with the results from others studies (Sabeti et (11., 2007).
These include the Duffy antigen/Chemokine receptor (Chr 1, CEU
versus YRI / Jola) (Figure 3a) and the ﬂ-globin (HBB) locus
(Chr 11, Jola versus CEU / YRI) (Figure 3b showing the large
deviation in PBF across a wider region), where both regions are
known to have been selected due to the advantage they provide
against malaria. Similarly, we detected the F CGRZB and F CGR3B
receptors (Chr 1, Jola versus CEU / ASIA) and GYPC gene (Chr
2, Jola versus CEU / YRI), which provide some protection against
Plasmodium falciparum infection. We detected differences in the
genes involved in skin pigmentation, such as the OCAZ (Chr 15,

A Bayesian approach using covariance of SNP data

 

5 DISCUSSION

The PBF metric is a potentially robust and ﬂexible measure to
quantify differences in LD between sub-groups, which does not
require time-consuming permutation approaches to infer statistical
signiﬁcance. Moreover, being Bayesian it readily allows for
the incorporation of prior information such as knowledge of
candidate regions of selection. Depending on the sub-groups of
interest, regional differences in LD may be indicative of selection,
recombination and/or phenotypic variation. The magnitude of
the PBF reﬂects the difference in the covariances of genotype
frequencies, accounting explicitly for the number of samples and
SNPs contributing. The assumption of Gaussian allele counts is more
likely to hold in non-ascertained polymorphisms and large numbers
of SNPs, but our simulation and real data results suggest that method
may be robust to deviations. If another distribution is considered
more suitable for allele counts or non-conjugate priors adopted, then
it may be possible to obtain the posterior distribution and perform
inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (Robert and
Casella, 2004). Bayes factors can be estimated in such settings (see
Clark et (11 ., 2007, for an example), usually at greater computational
expense. A number of other non-Bayesian approaches to compare
covariance matrices could be considered as alternatives (Morrison,
1990), some robust to missing data (Jamshidian and Schott, 2007).
EVD-based methods are easy to calculate, impose few assumptions,
and it is possible to take advantage of known distributional properties
associated with eigenvalues (Jiang, 2004; Johnstone, 2001). In
addition, it is possible to extend EVD approaches to a Bayesian
setting, facilitating ﬁlll probabilistic inference. In conclusion, we
present a new approach for quantifying LD differences in genome-
wide studies, which may have potential utility in a trans-ethnic
ﬁne-mapping setting.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: In recent years, much structural information on protein
domains and their pair-wise interactions has been made available in
public databases. However, it is not yet clear how best to use this
information to discover general rules or interaction patterns about
structural protein—protein interactions. Improving our ability to detect
and exploit structural interaction patterns will help to provide a better
3D picture of the known protein interactome, and will help to guide
docking-based predictions of the 3D structures of unsolved protein
complexes.

Results: This article presents KBDOCK, a 3D database approach for
spatially clustering protein binding sites and for performing template-
based (knowledge-based) protein docking. KBDOCK combines
residue contact information from the 3D|D database with the Pfam
protein domain family classification together with coordinate data
from the Protein Data Bank. This allows the 3D configurations of all
known hetero domain—domain interactions to be superposed and
clustered for each Pfam family. We find that most Pfam domain
families have up to four hetero binding sites, and over 60% of
all domain families have just one hetero binding site. The utility of
this approach for template-based docking is demonstrated using 73
complexes from the Protein Docking Benchmark. Overall, up to 45
out of 73 complexes may be modelled by direct homology to existing
domain interfaces, and key binding site information is found for 24
of the 28 remaining complexes. These results show that KBDOCK
can often provide useful information for predicting the structures of
unknown protein complexes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein interactions (PPIs) are central to many cellular
processes. Proteins often perform their function by interacting
with other proteins to form protein—protein complexes. In order
to understand and predict PPIs reliably, and to relate such

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

interactions to biological function, knowledge of the 3D structures of
protein—protein complexes is vitally important. To date, over 65 000
protein structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank
(PDB; Berman et (11., 2002). However, it has been estimated recently
that only ~12% of these structures correspond to heteromeric
complexes (Stein et (11., 2011). Therefore, to bridge this gap, there
is much interest in developing computational techniques to predict
how two proteins ﬁt together to form a complex (Aloy et (11., 2005).
However, until recently, many of the hetero complexes in the PDB
have been enzyme-inhibitor complexes, which are relatively easy
to model directly. Hence, so-called template-based protein docking
has not yet attracted much attention from the research community
(Kundrotas et (11., 2008).

Since it is well known that protein folds are often more
evolutionarily conserved than their sequences (Chothia and Lesk,
1986), and since it has been shown that proteins with similar
sequences often interact in similar ways (Aloy et (11., 2003),
it follows that close structural homologues should also be expected
to interact in similar ways. Several studies have found that the
locations of protein interaction sites are often conserved, especially
within domain families, regardless of the structures of their binding
partners (Gunther et (11., 2007; Keskin et (11., 2005; Korkin et (11.,
2005, 2006). Additionally, it has also been observed that many
protein families employ only one or a small number of binding sites
(Keskin and Nussinov, 2007; Shoemaker et (11., 2006), suggesting
that the same surface patch is often re-used. Indeed, it has been
demonstrated previously that the structure of an unknown protein
complex may often be successfully modelled using the known
binding sites of homologous domains (Kundrotas et (11., 2008;
Launay and Simonson, 2008). This may be described as template-
based docking or docking by homology (Korkin et (11., 2006;
Kundrotas and Alexov, 2006).

In recent years, much structural information on protein domains
and on PPIs has been made available in on-line databases
(Tuncbag et (11., 2009). However, beyond listing the residues
observed at the interface between a given pair of proteins or
protein domains, there is no generally accepted way to deﬁne
what actually constitutes a protein binding site or to quantify
whether or not two binding sites are structurally similar. For
example, recent methods to compare structural interfaces have
used techniques based on e.g. geometric hashing of cliques of
interface Car atoms (Keskin et (11., 2004), combining geometric
hashing with a physicochemical complementarity scoring function

Spatial clustering of protein domain binding sites

 

(Shulman-Peleg et (11., 2004), geometric overlap and face angle
scores of residue contact vectors (Kim et (11., 2006), principal
component analysis of residue contact matrices (Aung et (11., 2008),
complete linkage hierarchical clustering of groups of interface
residues (Stein et (11., 2010) and dynamic programming-based
fragment assembly (Gao and Skolnick, 2010).

Some recent examples of structural PPI databases are PIBASE
(Davis and Sali, 2005), SCOPPI (Winter et (11., 2006), SCOWLP
(Teyra et (11., 2006), 3D Complex (Levy et (11., 2006), 3D-partner
(Chen et (11., 2007), PiSite (Higurashi et (11., 2009), IBIS (Shoemaker
et (11., 2010) and 3DID (Stein et (11., 2010). Several of these
databases describe PPIs in terms of domain—domain interactions
(DDIs) because protein domains may often be identiﬁed as structural
and ﬁinctional units. Three widely used domain deﬁnitions are Pfam
(Finn et (11., 2010), SCOP (Murzin et (11., 1995) and CATH (Cuff
et (11., 2009). Pfam deﬁnes domain using sequence similarities, while
the SCOP and CATH domain deﬁnitions are based on both sequence
and structural similarities. Current structural PPI databases clearly
constitute useﬁil bioinformatics resources. However, it is not yet
straightforward to use them to extract general patterns that describe
the spatial nature of PPIs at the family level. Furthermore, because
the question of how best to compare and cluster protein interfaces
remains an open problem, it is not yet clear how best to use structural
databases to propose suitable templates for homology-based docking
predictions.

Here we present KBDOCK, a 3D database approach for spatially
clustering protein binding sites and for performing template-based
(knowledge-based) protein docking. KBDOCK combines residue
contact information from the 3DID database with the Pfam protein
domain family classiﬁcation and protein coordinate data from
the PDB in order to superpose and spatially cluster all known
hetero DDIs for each Pfam family. The main features that distinguish
KBDOCK from existing structural PPI databases are that: (i) it uses
the Pfam consensus sequence to guide structural alignments; (ii) it
places all of the complexes involving a given Pfam domain family
into a common coordinate frame in order to locate the interaction
partners consistently in 3D space; (iii) it uses the notion of ‘core’
and ‘rim’ interface residues to help deﬁne the geometric centre
of a binding site; (iv) for each domain of interest, it spatially
clusters a weighted combination of the core and rim interface
residues of all DDIs involving that domain in order to deﬁne domain
family binding sites; (v) it may be used to identify automatically
the best available DDI template to use to model by homology a
complex of two given domains; and (vi) even when no suitable DDI
template exists, it can still propose candidate binding sites on one or
both interaction partners as potential constraints for computational
docking. Thus, KBDOCK represents a novel knowledge-based
approach for proposing structural templates for protein docking.

Our approach is illustrated using 10 example query domains, each
having multiple hetero interactions that may be clustered into a
small number of domain family binding sites. The utility of the
approach for template-based protein docking is demonstrated using
73 complexes from the Protein Docking Benchmark (version 4).
Overall, up to 45 out of 73 complexes may be modelled by
direct homology to existing domain interfaces, and key binding site
information is found for 24 of the 28 remaining complexes. There are
only four targets for which no homologous hetero DDIs exist. These
results show that KBDOCK can often provide useﬁil information for
predicting the structures of unknown protein complexes.

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview of KBDOCK

KBDOCK is built from three main data sources. Multiple sequence
alignments and consensus sequences are provided by Pfam. residue contact
data and Pfam domain assignments are extracted from the 3DID database.
and protein coordinates are obtained from the PDB. We use 3D1D as our
source of DDIs because it uses the Pfam classiﬁcation to describe domains.
and because it is one of the most complete and up-to-date structural PPI
databases currently available. 3D1D considers an interface to exist between
two domains whenever ﬁve or more contacts (hydrogen bonds. electrostatic.
or van der Waals atomic interactions) exist between the two domains. This
means that 3D1D contains both permanent and transient DDIs which may
arise from both biologically relevant and non-biological (i.e. crystal contact)
interactions. The version of 3D1D used here (November 2009) contains a
total of 140612 DDIs drawn from 29 922 PDB structures. A total of 3755
different Pfam families are involved in at least one DDI.

The KBDOCK database is implemented using the MySQL relational
database (http://www.mysql.com). All calculations and queries against
the database are made using a small set of Prolog programs
(http://www.swi-prolog.org/) and R scripts (http://www.r-project.org/). A
web interface (http://kbdock.loria.fr) has been implemented using the PHP
scripting language (http://php.net) and the Jmol plug-in for Visualization
(http://jmol.sourceforge.net). Figure 1 summarizes the processing steps used
to populate the KBDOCK database. These are described in further detail
below. The current version of KBDOCK stores Pfam domain family binding
site information for a total of 2721 non-redundant (NR) hetero DDIs
involving 1029 Pfam domain families. A MySQL dump of the database is
available from the authors on request.

2.2 Selecting non-redundant hetero DDIs

Although the 3DID database stores all known DDIs. our main goal is to
predict the 3D structures of heteromeric PPIs. as these are often the most
difﬁcult structures to solve experimentally (Ezkurdia at al. . 2009). Therefore.
for each protein domain present in 3D1D. all DDIs involving that domain
are extracted and classiﬁed as either ‘intra’ . ‘homo’ or ‘hetero’. We consider
a DDI to be intra if the interacting domains belong to a single protein chain.
and homo if the interacting domains belong to different instances of the
same protein chain in a given PDB structure. Otherwise. the interaction is
considered to be hetero. Figure 2 illustrates these types of domain interactions
schematically. Here. only hetero DDIs are considered further. although in
principle the approach could also be used to model homo dimers.

Next. non-biological hetero interactions are ﬁltered out. It has been
shown that biological interactions usually have larger interfacial areas than
non-biological interactions (Janin and Rodier. 1995). Hence. we use the
DSSP program (Kabsch and Sander. 1983) to calculate the solvent accessible
surfaces (SASS) buried within each domain interface. If a given domain has
multiple interactions with other identical domains. e.g. due to crystal packing.

between two protein chains. P1 and P2. Protein chains can contain one
or more domains connected by linker regions (straight lines). Each shape
(circle. rectangle. triangle) represents a different Pfam domain. Lines with
arrowheads represent DDIs.

we assume that the interaction with the largest buried SAS corresponds to
the biological interaction. and only this DDI is retained.

It is also important to detect and eliminate duplicate or near-duplicate
DDIs that may arise in other ways. For example. the same protein complex
might have been solved under different crystallographic conditions. or a
single crystal structure can sometimes contain different copies of the same
complex. In order to deal with such cases. the sequences of the DDI partners
are concatenated. and the NRDB9O program (Holm and Sander. 1998) is used
with a similarity threshold of 99% to collect a ﬁnal list of distinct NR DDIs.

It is worth noting that because we consider every structure to be useful. a
high similarity threshold is used in order to retain as many non-duplicate
structures as possible. This does not introduce any bias because here binding
sites are deﬁned by spatial clustering and not by counting residue frequencies.

2.3 Annotating DDI interfaces

As discussed above. the residues in PPI sites are often conserved across
domain families. Indeed. due to evolutionary pressure. active site residues are
often less likely to undergo mutation than other residue positions (Zvelebil
at al.. 1987). and this phenomenon has been exploited previously to predict
molecular interaction sites (Aytuna et al.. 2005; Lichtarge at al.. 1996).
Therefore. the representative sets of hetero DDIs stored in KBDOCK are
annotated with both 1D sequence information from Pfam and 3D structure
information calculated using DSSP. respectively. For each Pfam domain
family. the Pfam database provides a multiple sequence alignment and a
consensus sequence of all UniProt sequences belonging to that family. We
follow the Pfam convention of considering a residue to be conserved if at
least 60% of the amino acids at a given position in the multiple sequence
alignment are of the same amino acid type. However. because Pfam uses
UniProt sequences rather than PDB structures. and because PDB structures
may contain gaps or unresolved regions. we align each PDB sequence
with its Pfam/UniProt sequence in order to map every PDB residue to its
corresponding Pfam consensus position. This mapping allows the 1D Pfam
consensus information to be transferred to each PDB residue position.

In order to enhance the 1D domain family information with 3D interaction
information. DSSP is used to calculate the change in solvent accessibility
for each interaction residue (as deﬁned by 3D1D) between the separate and
complexed structures of each domain. Here. we use the notion of ‘core’ and
‘rim’ residues. as deﬁned by Chakrabarti and Janin (2002). An interaction
residue is considered to be a core interface residue if it loses at least 75%
of its accessible surface area on going from the isolated to the complexed
structure. Otherwise. it is considered to be a rim interface residue.

2.4 Deﬁning protein domain family binding sites

Our mapping between the Pfam consensus sequence and PDB residue
numbers provides a convenient way to identify the conserved residue
positions of all domains stored in KBDOCK. Hence. it is straightforward
to retrieve the Ca coordinates of the conserved residue positions in a given

domain of interest along with the structures of all of the corresponding DDI
partners. and to place these in a common coordinate frame using the ProFit
(http://bioinf.org.uk) least-squares ﬁtting program.

Superposing all the DDIs involving a given Pfam domain in this way
provides a straightforward way to cluster individual binding sites and to
identify automatically distinct PPIs in 3D space. For example. for each
superposed DDI. the centre of mass. Q. of each binding site is calculated
as a weighted average of the corresponding core (75%) and rim (25%) Ca
coordinates. By also calculating the all-atom centre of mass 2 for each
domain. an interface direction vector. K. may then be calculated as

Z=(Q-Q)/IQ-Ql- (1)

In order to deﬁne domain family binding sites automatically. we cluster
the dimensionless interface vectors using Ward’s hierarchical clustering
algorithm (Ward. 1963). This is illustrated in Supplementary Figure S 1. From
Visual inspection of several example interfaces. we ﬁnd that a clustering
threshold of 0.4 often gives acceptable clusters.

2.5 Finding docking templates

In order to predict the 3D interaction between a pair of proteins. we need to
query the database with two or more domains and to calculate the intersection
of the results. This broadly corresponds to calculating a spatial join in
a conventional relational database. Although one PPI can involve several
DDIs. for simplicity only pair-wise DDIs are considered here. This leads to
four possible outcomes. namely that the database is found to contain DDIs
involving (i) both query domains together; (ii) both domains individually;
(iii) just one domain; or (iv) neither domain.

In the ﬁrst case. which we call a full homology (FH) DDI. the database
DDI would be very likely to provide a good template with which to model the
unknown interaction. The two query domains could be docked by homology
simply by superposing them onto the FH template. If several such DDIs exist
in the database. and if they correspond to different binding sites on the query
domain(s). KBDOCK selects for each site the DDI with the highest overall
sequence identity to the query domains. On the other hand. if homologous
DDIs exist in the database for both of the query domains individually (case ii).
it is reasonable to suppose that their binding sites might be re-used in the
target complex. thus providing a rational way to initialize a more exhaustive
computational docking calculation. Similarly. if just one of the target domains
has known binding sites (case iii). these could still be used to constrain a
computational docking run. These two cases may be termed docking by
‘semi-homology’ (SH) in analogy to the notion of a semi-join in relational
algebra. In such cases. KBDOCK selects the best available homologous
DDI for one or both query domains. as appropriate. and it identiﬁes the
residue(s) on the query domain(s) which lie closest to the centre of the
corresponding binding site(s). These residue identities could then be used to
deﬁne computational docking constraints. Clearly. if the database contains no
homologous interactions. the target complex must be modelled by ab initio
docking. However. as this study is primarily concerned with exploring a
new knowledge-based approach for ﬁnding docking templates. the use of
computational docking techniques is not considered here.

2.6 The Protein Docking Benchmark

In order to explore the utility of using KBDOCK to ﬁnd homology templates
for protein docking. our approach was used to predict a subset of the protein
docking targets in version 4 of the Protein Docking Benchmark (Hwang et al. .
2010). The Docking Benchmark is a non-redundant expert-curated set of 176
protein complexes for which the bound complex structures. and most of the
unbound component structures. have been solved by X-ray crystallography
to a resolution of 3.25 A or better. Since KBDOCK works at the domain level.
we selected all single domain complexes belonging to the ‘Enzyme-Inhibitor’
(here called ‘Enzyme’) and ‘Other’ categories of the Docking Benchmark
for this preliminary experiment. In other words. for simplicity we exclude
the Benchmark ‘Antibody’ complexes (because apart from involving the

entail homology) and we exclude all other complexes involving multiple
domains. This gives a test set of 36 Enzyme and 37 Other target complexes.

It should be noted that the Docking Benchmark complexes do not
necessarily provide an unbiased set of homology modelling targets. Because
several of the benchmark proteins have been relatively well studied. it is
possible that the PDB could contain more homologues of those complexes
than randomly selected complexes. In order to take into account this possible
source of bias. a stringent test would be to exclude as templates all structures
with more recent PDB deposition dates than the target structure. However.
ﬁltering complexes by target date often excludes a large proportion of the
database. Therefore. in order to provide upper and lower bounds on the utility
of template-based modelling. and to try to quantify the growing usefulness of
knowledge-based approaches. we report results both with and without date
ﬁltering.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Deﬁning domain family binding sites

Superposing families of related DDIs in a common coordinate
frame and clustering their interface direction vectors [Equation (1)]
provide a straightforward way to analyse structural relationships
between the members of a given query domain. Figure 3 shows
the superpositions and interface vectors calculated for the ﬁve
DDIs involving the Kunitz legume Pfam family. This ﬁgure clearly
shows that this domain has four distinct interaction sites, one of
which is common to two different trypsin/inhibitor complexes.
Supplementary Figure S1 shows the spatial clustering dendrograrn
for this family, and for a further three example Pfam families
(namely, Kunitz BPTI, Ribonuclease and Actin).

Spatial clusters have been calculated and stored in KBDOCK
for all the 1029 Pfam domain families which are involved in
hetero interactions. Superposing and clustering all Pfam domain
binding sites in KBDOCK takes ~8 CPU hours on a 64-bit 2.8 GHz
Q9550 processor. Table 1 summarizes the number of hetero DDI
partners and calculated binding sites for 10 example Pfam domain
families, including the four examples considered above. This table
shows that these Pfam domains typically have from one to four
binding sites, according to our spatial clustering algorithm. It is
interesting to note that even domains involved in many DDIs such
as Kunitz BPTI, Trypsin and Actin still have only a relatively small
number of distinct binding sites.

Figure 4 shows the DDI superpositions for the 10 Pfam families
listed in Table 1. In most cases, visual inspection of the complexes
in this ﬁgure readily conﬁrms the calculated number of binding sites

given in Table 1. For example, the Potato inhibit domain interacts
with eight other domains (all serine proteases) using a single binding
site. On the other hand, the Kunitz BPTI domain has two inhibitory
binding sites, and, as shown in Table 1, the Kunitz legume inhibitor
has four binding sites that form distinct interfaces with four different
domain families, namely Trypsin, Thioredoxin, Alpha-amylase and
Peptidase S8. Conversely, Thioredoxin interacts with eight different
Pfam families, but it does so using just two overlapping binding
sites.

For domains that have multiple binding sites and which interact
with several different domain partners (e.g. Fer2, Lectin C , Lys, Actin
and Trypsin), it can be difﬁcult to distinguish all the interactions
visually. Hence, KBDOCK allows the user to select and display only
those DDIs involving a given binding site. Comparing the DDIs of
binding sites selected in this way using 3D graphical visualization
software such as Jmol often shows that our clustering algorithm
calculates acceptable clusters in almost all cases.

Figure 5 shows the distribution and the change with time of the
number of binding sites per domain family (excluding the very large
CI-set immunoglobulin domain family) of all NR hetero DDIs in
KBDOCK. This ﬁgure conﬁrms that most domains typically have
from one to four hetero binding sites, and only a very small number
of domains such as Trypsin (six binding sites) have more than this.
Indeed, over 60% of all hetero domains in KBDOCK have just one
binding site, which supports the notion that domain binding sites are
often re-used in different DDIs. It is interesting to note that despite
the growing number of Pfam domains for which KBDOCK contains

3.2 Docking by homology

Table 2 summarizes the results of querying KBDOCK to ﬁnd
docking templates for the 73 target complexes, both with and without
ﬁltering DDIs by PDB deposition date. Full details of these results
are given in Supplementary Tables S 1—S3. Supplementary Figure S2
shows two examples of docking targets for which KBDOCK ﬁnds
FH and SH templates, respectively. For all targets, the structures
of the unbound domains given by Hwang et al. (2010) were used
as query domains, and the corresponding crystallographic complex
(i.e. the expected solution) was excluded from the modelling
procedure. Here, a FH template is considered to be correct if the root
mean squared deviation (RMSD) between it and the native complex
is <10 A. This is similar to the CAPRI criteria for an ‘acceptable’
docking prediction (Mendez et al., 2005). According to this criterion,
Table 2 shows that KBDOCK ﬁnds good FH templates for a total of
24 out of 36 Enzyme target complexes, although this number falls to
13 when PDB deposition date ﬁltering is applied. A further 10 targets
have SH DDIs involving one or both of the target domains, and

3This table shows the number of docking targets for which the proposed templates
are correct compared to the total number of templates retrieved. When SH templates
are found for both domains individually (‘Two SH templates’), the ﬁgures in brackets
give the number of cases in which both binding sites are modelled correctly plus the
number in which only one binding site is modelled correctly. Full details are presented
in Supplementary Tables S153.

just two Enzyme targets have no hetero DDI information. Similarly,
Table 2 shows that 21 (or 13 with date ﬁltering) of the 37 Other
targets may be modelled using FH templates, and a further 14 targets
have SH DDIs involving one or both of the target domains. Like the
Enzyme targets, only two of the Other targets have no hetero DDI
information.

Table 2 shows that all the retrieved FH templates are correct
according to the 10 A RMSD threshold. Thus, if KBDOCK retrieves
a FH template, there is a high probability that it represents a good
model of the target complex. However, Supplementary Table S1
shows that KBDOCK sometimes ﬁnds more than one distinct FH
interface for a given pair of query domains. In other words, the
instances of two domain families can sometimes interact via more
than one combination of binding sites. For example, KBDOCK
retrieves two FH templates for three of the Enzyme targets (ldf ,
leaw, 2pcc) without date ﬁltering, and for just one target (leaw)
when date ﬁltering is applied. Subsequent visual inspection of

Spatial clustering of protein domain binding sites

 

the calculated templates for the matriptase/BPTI target (PDB code
leaw) showed that the ﬁrst trypsinogen/BPTI DDI (2r9p) provides
a very good template (with an overall RMSD between the template
and target of 0.79 A), whereas the second (lower sequence identity)
FH template corresponds to a different inhibitor orientation found
in the prothrombin/boophilin complex (2ody; 8.54 A RMSD).

Similarly, visual inspection of the calculated templates for two
of the Other targets (1qu, 1m10) conﬁrmed that these FH templates
correspond to two different binding modes for both the G-protein
complex (1qu) and the M3-protein complex (1m10), and that the
ﬁrst (highest sequence identity) template best matches the target
(0.70 and 1.03A RMSD, respectively). On the other hand, the
two DDIs (1z7x and 2bex) calculated for the large RnaseA/LRR
1 Enzyme complex (ldfj) were seen to overlap considerably, and
the two large binding sites calculated for the RnaseA domain should
have been clustered as a single binding site. Similarly, two of the
Other DDIs (1mq8, 2ayo) are calculated to have two distinct binding
sites, although visual inspection again suggests that these should
have been clustered as a single binding site. We believe that such
clustering artefacts sometimes arise due to different assignments of
core and rim residues in different instances of homologous DDIs.
The peroxidase/cytochrome C Enzyme target (2pcc) is another
interesting case. Although the two DDIs calculated for this target
are quite distinct, further investigation revealed that one of the DDIs
arises, because the crystal contact between these domains was larger
than the biological contact in the 1s6v structure. Consequently, two
binding sites instead of one were also calculated for these domains.
Thus, KBDOCK can successﬁilly retrieve alternate FH binding
modes when they exist in the database, but it can also be seen that
its clustering algorithm has a slight tendency to overestimate the
number of distinct binding sites.

As might be expected, fewer FH templates are available when
PDB data ﬁltering is applied, and this causes an increase in the
number of proposed SH templates. When only SH templates are
retrieved, we assess their quality by comparing each proposed
binding site with that of the native complex and if our interface
clustering algorithm would group them together, we consider
the retrieved template to be correct. The ﬁnal two columns of
Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 show the outcome of this test,
and Table 2 summarizes the overall results. For example, SH DDIs
involving the two individual query domains exist for ﬁve of the
Enzyme targets. Supplementary Table S2 shows that three of these
targets (1e6e, lacb, 1f6m) may be modelled correctly by re-using
their Pfam domain binding sites, and one further target (lov8) may
be partially modelled by re-using one of the two proposed SH
templates. On the other hand, there are three Other targets for which
the two query domains both have SH templates, but none of these
lead to acceptable models. For those cases where only one SH
template exists for a given target, the binding sites of one of the
queries is found to be re-used in the target DDI in a total of three
out of ﬁve Enzyme targets (1 gll, 4cpa, 1fq1) and ﬁve out of 11
Other targets (1ktz, 2g77, 1wq1, 2h7v, 1y64). In order to assist any
subsequent computational docking calculation that might use these
templates, Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 show the proposed
PDB template along with the name of the query residue calculated
to be at the centre of the binding site.

Overall, it can be seen that KBDOCK can provide high-quality
FH docking templates for a total of 45 of the 73 targets (or 26/73 with
date ﬁltering). Even when no FH templates exist, KBDOCK can still

ﬁnd useful binding site information for at least one of the domain
partners for 12 of the remaining 28 targets (or 18/47 with date
ﬁltering). These results demonstrate that the approach embodied in
KBDOCK provides a useﬁil way to ﬁnd protein docking templates.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Comparison with previous approaches

Because the main aim of KBDOCK is to facilitate automatic docking
by homology, it has several novel aspects that have not been
explored in previous studies of structural PPIs. In particular, because
protein docking is inherently a spatial problem (with six degrees
of freedom in the simplest rigid body assumption), KBDOCK was
designed from the start to consider the relative spatial arrangements
of interacting protein domains, and to deal with cases where a ﬁill
homology template is not necessarily available. This is in contrast
to the most previous PPI classiﬁcation approaches, which generally
apply clustering techniques to groups of residues belonging to both
partners of existing interfaces. For example, 3DID deﬁnes a domain
interface by applying complete linkage hierarchical clustering to
identify groups of shared interface residues within a Pfam domain
family (Stein et al., 2009). It then labels each distinct occurrence of
a domain/interface pair as an ‘interaction topology’, and it applies
a further round of hierarchical clustering to deﬁne ‘global interface
clusters’ that group together individual interfaces (Stein et al., 2010).
This gives an average of about 10 global interfaces per Pfam domain
[see Figure 3 of Stein et al. (2010)].

Kim et al. (2006) represent an interface as a pair of ‘face vectors’,
each of which contains a list of ones and zeros to represent the
contacting and non-contacting residues of each domain, respectively.
The face vectors within a SCOP domain are then grouped according
to the cosine similarity between their face vectors, and interfaces
with similar faces are superposed and clustered according to their
face overlap and the angle between the centroids of pairs of faces
(Kim et al., 2006; Winter et al., 2006). Pairs of faces are then
combined to deﬁne interface types. This procedure is reported
to give on average about 5.4 distinct interface types per SCOP
domain family (Winter et al., 2006). Other approaches such as
3DID, PPiClust (Aung et al., 2008) and I2I-SiteEngine (Shulman-
Peleg et al., 2004) also cluster and analyse pair-wise interfaces
rather than individual binding sites. Clearly, the interface direction
vectors used in KBDOCK share a similar inspiration to the face
angle measure of Kim et al. (2006). However, Kim et al. (2006)
focused on studying the diversity of domain interfaces, the evolution
of hub proteins and gene fusion events (often manifested as
intra-domain interactions), whereas our study focuses on ﬁnding
docking templates for hetero domain interactions. Thus, our study
complements and extends previous work.

Previous template-based docking approaches have used
comparative patch analysis, threading and sequence alignment
techniques (Chen and Skolnick, 2008; Korkin et al., 2006;
Kundrotas and Vakser, 2010; Kundrotas et al., 2008; Launay
and Simonson, 2008), for example. Hence, at a conceptual level,
KBDOCK shares a similar inspiration with the comparative patch
analysis approach of Korkin et al. (2006). This approach deﬁnes
and clusters binding sites of interacting SCOP domains using a
scalar ‘localisation index’ calculated as a sum of contact residue
frequencies in the context of the superposed domains of a given

SCOP family (Korkin et al., 2005). This index serves as a kind
of fuzzy set membership measure, and does not consider the
directional nature of the interface, whereas KBDOCK explicitly
clusters binding sites according to the spatial orientation of their
core and interface residues.

From a template docking point of view, KBDOCK is somewhat
similar to the HOMBACOP approach of Kundrotas et al. (2008).
HOMBACOP begins by using PSI-BLAST to identify candidate
structural templates for a given pair of sequences, and these
are reﬁned using a further round of sequence-based template
matching using a position-speciﬁc scoring matrix enriched with
interface information of the known templates. In a similar spirit,
Launay and Simonson (2008) use the solvent accessibility of
interface residues to enhance their Needleman—Wunsch alignment
of candidate templates. However, they then use an energy ﬁinction
to select the ﬁnal template, whereas HOMBACOP uses sequence
similarity and KBDOCK uses structural similarity to the target
domains as the ﬁnal selection criteria. Compared with HOMBACOP
that used the PROTCOM database (Kundrotas and Alexov, 2007)
without date ﬁltering to produce 19 models for 43 targets (44%)
from the Docking Benchmark version 2 (Mintseris et al., 2005),
KBDOCK ﬁnds good FH templates for 26 (36%) and 45 (62%) out
of 73 targets with and without date ﬁltering, respectively. Hence,
KBDOCK appears to be rather competitive compared to the earlier
approach.

Overall, KBDOCK provides high-quality FH docking templates
for 62% of the targets studied here, and it ﬁnds useﬁil binding
site information for a further 39% (11/28) of the remaining targets.
Following these very promising results, we are extending KBDOCK
to deal with multi-domain complexes, and to link it directly to our
rigid body docking software (Ritchie and Kemp, 2000).

4.2 Implications for the 3D interactome

There is growing interest in using docking techniques to predict
large-scale structural PPIs (Kundrotas et al., 2010; Launay and
Simonson, 2008; Mosca et al., 2009; Sinha et al., 2008; Wass
et al., 2011). However, results from the CAPRI docking experiment
(Lensink and Wodak, 2010) show that current docking algorithms
still face the problem of how to distinguish a good solution from a list
of feasible but mostly incorrect predicted docking orientations. On
the other hand, exploiting biochemical or biophysical knowledge
in data-driven docking (van Dijk et al., 2005) can often help
to constrain the scope of a docking calculation and considerably
improve the quality of the results (Korkin et al., 2006; Lensink and
Wodak, 2010; Ritchie, 2008). Hence, if prior biological knowledge
is available in a suitable form, it would be desirable to be able to
incorporate it automatically in a docking calculation.

Kim et al. (2006) note that many of the currently known interface
types only started to become available in the mid-1990s. Hence,
early docking and interface studies only had a small repertoire of
interface types to work with. They also found that although the
number of interface types continues to grow, the rate of growth
is currently much less than the growth in the total number of
multi-domain structures that are being solved (Figure 5 of Kim
et al., 2006). Our analysis of the rate of growth in the number
of hetero binding sites since 1999 (Fig. 5) also shows only a
modest increase in the number of Pfam families having multiple
hetero binding sites, despite over a 3-fold increase in the number of

Pfam families for which hetero complexes are now available. This
strongly supports the notion that protein binding sites are very often
re-used. Of course, the hetero complexes available in the PDB are
not necessarily representative of the whole structural interactome.
Nonetheless, if the very small numbers of hetero protein binding
sites found here do indeed turn out to be typical, this will have
considerable implications for future data-driven and template-based
docking approaches, and for populating 3D PPI networks on a
genomic scale.

5 CONCLUSION

KBDOCK provides a systematic way to store and analyse the
3D structures of protein domain binding sites. By superposing the
structures of all hetero DDIs involving a given query domain, and
by using the simple notion of an interface direction vector to deﬁne
the central region a protein binding site, a small number of spatially
distinct binding sites may be identiﬁed for each Pfam domain family.
Using this approach, we ﬁnd that the majority of the 1029 Pfam
domain families have a small number (up to four) of hetero binding
sites, and over 60% have just one hetero binding site.

KBDOCK can be used to ﬁnd automatically homologous hetero
DDIs with which to model the unknown 3D structure of given
protein complex. In 60% of the docking benchmark examples
studied, KBDOCK ﬁnds a small number of high quality DDI
templates with which to model the target complex. Furthermore,
one of the unique strengths of KBDOCK is that it can ﬁnd semi-
homologous templates even when no full homology template is
available. Hence, KBDOCK provides a useﬁil knowledge-based
approach for template-based protein docking and for helping to
describe and understand structural PPIs on a genomic scale.

Abstract

Motivation: Information—theoretic and compositional analysis of biological sequences, in terms of
k—mer dictionaries, has a well established role in genomic and proteomic studies. Much less so in
epigenomics, although the role of k—mers in chromatin organization and nucleosome positioning is
particularly relevant. Fundamental questions concerning the informational content and compos—
itional structure of nucleosome favouring and disfavoring sequences with respect to their basic
building blocks still remain open.

Results: We present the first analysis on the role of k—mers in the composition of nucleosome en—
riched and depleted genomic regions (NER and NDR for short) that is: (i) exhaustive and within the
bounds dictated by the information—theoretic content ofthe sample sets we use and (ii) informative
for comparative epigenomics. We analize four different organisms and we propose a paradig—
matic formalization of k—mer dictionaries, providing two different and complementary views of the
k—mers involved in NER and NDR. The first extends well known studies in this area, its comparative
nature being its major merit. The second, very novel, brings to light the rich variety of k—mers
involved in influencing nucleosome positioning, for which an initial classification in terms of clus—
ters is also provided. Although such a classification offers many insights, the following deserves to
be singled—out: short p0|y(dA:dT) tracts are reported in the literature as fundamental for nucleo—
some depletion, however a global quantitative look reveals that their role is much less prominent
than one would expect based on previous studies.

We focus on the following particular research area in epigenom—
ics: the identification of mechanisms accounting for nucleosome or—
ganization and positioning in chromatin. It was initiated more than
30 years ago by Kornberg (1981) and, thanks to advances in
microarray and sequencing technologies, it has prospered in the past
few years. An extensive overview of its many aspects is provided in
(Jiang and Pugh, 2010; Minary and Levitt, 2014; Radman—Livaja
and Rando, 2009; Segal and Widom, 2009b; Struhl and Segal,
2013). Particularly relevant for this paper are the findings outlined
next.

The chromatin organization of eukaryotic genomes has been suc—
cessfully argued that it is DNA—encoded (Kaplan et al., 2008).
Therefore, it seems natural to complement such an argument with
an information—theoretic study aiming at establishing the similarity
and differences, in terms of their information—theoretic content, be—
tween NER and NDRs on a genomic scale. Such a study is not avail—
able. It is also a well established fact that sequence motifs and
regularities influence nucleosome positioning. The ones that have
been identified are: (i) the 10 bp periodicity of the dinucleotides AA/
TT/T A that oscillate in phase with each other and out of phase with
a similar perodicity of the GC denuclotides (Segal et al., 2006); (ii)
poly(dA:dT) tracts (Segal and Widom, 2009a), i.e. stretches of A’s
or T’s and (iii) the G + C content of a genomic region, with its A + T
content also playing some role (Peckham et al., 2007; Tillo and
Hughes, 2009). In terms of specific k—mers, studies about their role
in favouring nucleosome positioning have only identified a handful
of them, e.g. (Peckham et al., 2007; Tillo and Hughes, 2009) and no
systematic study seems to be available.

The above state of the art clearly indicates that the literature has
not addressed the following foundational issues:

1. An information—theoretic characterization of the NER and
NDR, highlighting similarities and differences.

2. A structural characterization of the ‘world of k—mers’ in terms of
their involvement in the composition of genomic sequences rich
or depleted of nucleosomes, with the possible identiﬁcation of
groups of similar k—mers that play a role in that composition.

We provide contributions to both issues. In particular, we pre—
sent the first information—theoretic analysis of NER and NDR.
Among the other useful insights, it establishes that the information
content of NER is surprisingly very close to that of NDR, yet such a
difference is statistically very significant. As for the second issue, we
provide a computational and statistical methodology that is used to
build epigenomic dictionaries, for the case of nucleosome position—
ing in UiUO. That is, catalogues of k—mers, each having a statistical
score assessing to which extend it favours or inhibits nucleosome
formation. Based on a sound information—theoretic argument, k—
mers of at most 10 basis are considered in this study. Interestingly,
k—mers that are known to favour or inhibit nucleosome positioning
from previous studies are correctly classified in our dictionaries, and
a rich, never highlighted before, variety of k—mers involved in nu—
cleosome positioning comes to light for the first time.

A final introductory remark is in order. The only previous study,
of which this one can be seen as its natural continuation, is the one
by Peckham et al. (2007), where in UiUO data have been used. We ad—
here to that choice here, pointing out the need for a genome—wide
analysis comparing k—mer preferences for nucleosome formation
in vitro and in UiUO. The very discriminative and methodologically
sound techniques given here are a relevant technical step forward
for its successful realization, whose outcome would add another im—
portant tile to the puzzle of ‘sequences and nucleosomes’.

2 Methods

The statistical and computational methodologies needed to address
points (1) and (2) of the Section 1 are summarized here. In particu—
lar, Section 2.1 highlights some basic steps, either identical or vari—
ants of well known ones in sequence analysis. Section 2.2 is
dedicated to the definition of weighted k—mer dictionaries, together
with weighting schemes, i.e. procedures to assign weights to k—mers.
Such a data structure is pragmatically used in genomic research, but
it has not been formalized. Our experiments bring to light the nov—
elty that such a pragmatism hides a powerful methodological para—
digm: properly modulated via an associated weighting schema, a
weighted dictionary can provide information about the same data
on different and complementary scales. Such a somewhat surprising
modulation ability, via two apparently very similar weighting
schemes, is demonstrated in Section 3.2 by comparing the results ob—
tained via two weighting schemes, one already used in nucleosome
positioning studies (Peckham et al., 2007), the other novel.

2.1 K—mer probabilities from counts: estimation,
conservation and differences in information content

Let 2 be an alphabet, fix an integer [<21 and let Pk be a probability
distribution establishing how probable is the extraction of any given
k—mer in 2k, to form a set of strings. Using a sample set D for the ex—
traction process, an estimate Pk of Pk needs to be computed. This
task is nearly standard in sequence analysis (Durbin et al., 1998).
Intuitively, one would like to use the k—mer frequency counts ob—
tained from the sample set. Indeed, the corresponding empirical
probability distribution is a Maximum Likelihood estimate of Pr.
However, when the sample size is too small compared with 2k, there
may be rare or missing k—mers in the sample which, having zero or
close to zero frequency counts, give rise to k—mer probabilities with
zero value in the estimate. In those cases, in order not to rely on a
small sample size for the estimation, one resorts to the introduction
of suitably chosen pseudo counts: they are added to the frequencies
of the k—mers. They are obtained by selecting an appropriate prior
distribution encoding prior knowledge about Pk. While the book by
Durbin et al. (1998) offers a good introduction to this topic, for the
convenience of the reader and to keep the paper self—contained,
some basic technical details are given in Section 1 of the
Supplementary Material. For this study, five of the most established
priors in the literature have been used: namely Maximum
Likelihood Estimate, Uniform—Bayes—Laplace, Jeffreys (1946), Perks
(1947) and Trybula (1947) (see Table 1 of the Supplementary
Material).

Once fixed the sample set D, it is to be expected that, as k grows,
the number of k—mers rare or absent in D increases. That results in
an estimation of Pr where prior knowledge (via the pseudo—counts)
becomes more and more relevant. To avoid such a problematic esti—
mation, it is natural to ask up to which maximum value kmx a good
estimate can be granted. It is worth of mention that such a question
is usually dealt with heuristically. Here a principled and quantifiable
choice is made: the value of kmx to be selected must guarantee an
estimate of Pk that accurately represents the information—theoretic
content of D. That is, the sample size should be ‘big enough” to
allow for a good estimation of the entropy of the source generating
the sample. The value of kmx here is computed according to a pro—
cedure recommended in (Dudok de Wit, 1999) for entropy estima—
tion. Again, for the interested reader and to keep the presentation
self—contained, technical details are given in Section 1 of the
Supplementary Material. The only thing that is needed at this stage
is that the procedure takes as input the dataset and a fixed a priori

cent difference between the entropy one could estimate from the
data and the true entropy of the source emitting the data. The closer
e is to zero, the better the estimate is. The output of the procedure is
kmx, for the given 6 and sample set.

Finally, let Q and P be two k—mer probability distributions. To
establish how close Q and P are in terms of their ‘information con—
tent” the following can be used: (i) the Hellinger distance DHL (Deza
and Deza, 2006), that assumes values in the interval [0,1]; (ii) a dis—
similarity measure SKL, based on the Kullback—Leibler divergence
(Cover and Thomas, 1991). They are both measures of difference in
information content in probability distributions (Csizar, 1967) and
their formal definition is provided in Section 1 of the Supplementary
Material. For completeness, we mention that those as well as analo—
gous measures have been used in related studies in epigenomics (e.g.
Pinello et al., 201 1, 2014).

2.2 Weighted k—mer dictionaries: the special case of
nucleosome positioning
Let or E (0.1) be a real value and fix an integer k E [1, kmx]. Let Dim
denote a set of triplets (x,w,s> such that: x is a k—mer, w is a real
value such that agwgl and s is a symbol from the binary alphabet
{+, —}. Intuitively, a value of s : :means that x is a ‘characteristic/
significant feature” of NER/NDR. In the reminder of this paper, to
refer to such an intuition, we use the shorthand ‘k—mer favouring/
disfavouring nucleosome positioning”. Again intuitively, the entire
triple states that x favours/disfavours nucleosome formation with a
‘confidence level” to at least equal to the given threshold or. The set
Drama
guity arises, it will be referred to simply as dictionary.

The ‘semantic” of a dictionary is given by a weighting scheme,

: digit)“ is a weighted k-rner dictionary. When no ambi—

which is a procedure that assigns weights to the k—mers in a diction—
ary suitably designed to assess via data analysis the level of involve—
ment of k—mers in nucleosome positioning.

Given two dictionaries, DE and Dkimal, let or : min(5c,oc’)

and k : min(/§1nax,kllnax). The join of those two is a new diction—
ary Diem”, obtained by taking all k—mers common to both, with the
same sign and a confidence level at least at.

For a given organism, the weighted dictionary that can be built
directly from genome—wide nucleosome positioning maps (referred
to simply as maps, when no ambiguity arises) has the special role of
a base dictionary. It can also be obtained by joining several dic—
tionaries, each obtained with the use of a distinct map.

We point out that the definition given above can be easily put in
general terms. The details are left to the reader.

2.2.1 The choice of a weighting scheme for nucleosome
positioning

Intuition suggests that, given a k—mer x favouring nucleosome en—
richment (to fix ideas), one of the following, non—mutually exclusive,
things should happen: its frequency should be (a) able to classify
well F : E U D into E and D when the frequency of x in f E F is
used as a classification score; (b) ‘significantly” different in NER and
NDR, i.e. such a difference in frequency is not due to chance.

Intuitively (i) can be formalized via Binary Classification in
Machine Learning while (ii) via Hypothesis Test in Statistics and,
for the convenience of the reader, they are both reported next. It is
worth to mention that (i) has been used by Peckham et al. (2007) in
extracting sequence nucleosome positioning signals in S.cereUisiae
while, to the best of our knowledge, the use of (ii) to ‘rank” k—mers
in terms of their favouring/disfavouring nucleosome positioning
preferences, is novel.

For completeness, it is worth mentioning that the identification
of an appropriate weighting scheme is strongly related to feature se-
lection in machine learning (Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003), although
neither of the two schemes outlined next can be regarded as feature
selection technique. This remark poses the problem of investigating
feature selection techniques in the context of this paper.

A weighting scheme based on Binary Classiﬁcation

Fix a k—mer x. Each sequence in F is given a score equal to the fre—
quency of occurrence of x in it, normalized by its length. Those
scores are then used to evaluate how well they classify E and D, via
ROC analysis (Fawcett, 2006). To this end, the analysis is first per—
formed by assigning class label 0 to sequences in E and then class
label 1. Notice that the assignment of a class label to sequences in E
determines the assignment of the corresponding class label to se—
quences in D. The maximum of the two corresponding AUCs is as—
signed as a confidence level to x. The symbol 5 is set to ‘+” if the
AUC with class label 1 assigned to E is higher than the AUC with
class label 0 assigned to E, and to ‘—” otherwise. The threshold or is a
real number in [0.5, 1) and corresponds to the minimum AUC that a
k—mer must obtain to be included in the dictionary.

A weighting scheme based on Hypothesis Test

Let Q and P be the k—mer empirical probability distributions associ—
ated to the sample sets E and D, respectively. For each x, let
dx : (px — qxl. Such a difference is normalized via the z—score zx
(see, e.g. Triola, 2012 for the definition of z—score and its uses in
data normalization). To establish the statistical significance of zx, a
Hypothesis Test can be performed via a Montecarlo simulation. The
interested reader can find details in (Giancarlo et al., 2008;
Giancarlo and Utro, 2012; Gordon, 1996). The Null Hypothesis
that the value of zx is due to chance is formalized by the way in
which the artificial datasets E’ and D’ (corresponding to E and D,
respectively) are generated in each step of the simulation. In particu—
lar, the set F : E U D is first shuffled a certain number of times
(1000 times, in this case) and then splitted in the two sets E’ and D’,
with (E’) :  and (D’) :  The symbol 5 is set to ‘+” if px > qx,
and ‘—” otherwise. The threshold or is set to the significance level used
in the test to reject the null hypothesis.

3 Results and discussion

We present here our findings in relation to the problems posed in
the Introduction. In particular, our analysis is based on the maps of

information—theoretic terms between those regions with respect to
each of them compared with the ‘background” genome.

Figure 1 shows a non—decreasing trend in the value of the differences
in information content, as a function of k. This behaviour is more
accentuated for the curves corresponding to homologous nucleo—
some enriched/depleted regions between the two organisms.
Although we found an analogous growth also in randomly gener—
ated sequences (see Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Material), it is
much more prominent in genomic sequences. Therefore, this estab—
lishes the following novel fact, relevant for syntactic—linguistic
studies of biological sequences. As the length of their ‘building
block” grows, there is a growing differentiation in terms of the in—
formation content of the genomic regions studied here, indicating
a growing syntactic—linguistic difference in the organization of the
basic building blocks within those sequences.

3.2 Epigenomic dictionaries

For the extraction of NER and NDR from nucleosome positioning
maps, a valid alternative to the one proposed by Kaplan et al.
(2008) is well exemplified by Valouev et al. (2008) in which nucleo—
some core and linker regions are used to investigate the existence of
universal sequence features, specifically short k—mers, involved in
nucleosome positioning. A data set of this kind has been recently
set—up by Guo et al. (2014), for research only somewhat related to
our study, but it is an excellent choice for an up—to—date collection of
short nucleosome—favoring/disfavoring sequences. Those authors
provide three pairs of sets of short NER and NDR associated to
C.elegans, D.rnelanogaster and H.5apiens, respectively. Indeed, each
pair is extracted from genome—wide in UiUO nucleosome positioning
maps of the corresponding organism. For this type of data set, the
NER are (typically) nucleosome core sequences and the NDR are
linker regions, each of length 147—bp. A summary of the procedure
used to extract those data sets from the corresponding maps is re—
ported in Section 2 of the Supplementary Material.

3.2.1 Weighted dictionaries: base and inter-organism

Epigenomic dictionaries, for the specific case of k—mers involved in
the composition of nucleosome forming/disfavoring sequences, are
obtained with the use of both the NER and NDR of Section 3.1 and
the ones obtained from the data by Guo et al. (2014). Moreover,
data derived by Peckham et al. (2007) for S.cereUisiae has also been
integrated in our framework, since their supplementary file ‘feature
scores” is a de facto dictionary with a Binary Classification weight—
ing scheme. For each organism, the procedures described in Section
2.2 have been applied with thresholds at 16% and 0.55 to obtain

the corresponding weighted dictionaries, respectively. This means
that only those k—mers whose confidence level, i.e. either p—value or
AUC, is higher than or equal to the fixed thresholds are considered of
relevance and therefore stored in the corresponding dictionary.
Based on those, two different kinds of dictionaries have been built,
as follows.

° Base dictionaries with Binary Classiﬁcation and Hypothesis Test
weighting schemes. For ﬂy and human, the dictionaries men—
tioned earlier are taken as base. This applies also to yeast, but
only for the Hypothesis Test case. As for its base Binary
Classiﬁcation dictionary, it is the join of the dictionaries com—
ing from the NER and NDR in Section 3.1 and the mentioned
ﬁle by Peckham et al. (2007). As for the worm, for both types of
dictionary, we take as base the join between the dictionary
coming from the NER and NDR in Section 3.1 and that coming
from the NER and NDR obtained from the data in (Guo et al.,
2014).

° Inter—organism. For each subset of at least two of the four organ—
isms considered here, both types of dictionaries have been built
to explore conservation of k—mer involvement in different organ—
isms. They are the join of the corresponding base dictionaries.

3.2.2 Summary statistics

Table 1 shows the percentage of k—mers stored in the base diction—
aries (columns 2 and 3), with respect to the total number, i.e. % 410,
of k—mers that have been tested for inclusion. Table 2 (Columns 2
and 3) provides statistics shedding light on the level of conservation
in k—mer usage for the composition of NER and NDRs. How that is
measured is explained in the table caption. In all tables presented
here nucleosome forming k—mers are indicated with a ‘+”, while ‘—”
denotes the nucleosome disfavouring k—mers. Additional statistics
on the number of k—mers stored in the dictionaries are given in
Tables 54 and 55 of the Supplementary Material.

Even with confidence thresholds only moderately selective, both
techniques bring to light that a very low percentage of k—mers are
involved in nucleosome formation/depletion. Moreover, nucleosome
forming k—mers are much more abundant than nucleosome disfa—
vouring ones (see Table 1 again). Among and between different or—
ganisms, there is some level of conservation on the usage of
nucleosome forming or disfavoring k—mers. However, the set(s) in
which there is agreement is rather small and quite dependent on the
organisms involved in the join.

Those two tables also bring to light the complementarity of the
two techniques used for this study. Indeed, the one based on Binary
Classification is certainly much more discriminative than the one
based on Hypothesis Test. Its main merit is its ability to identify in
the corresponding dictionaries of each organism a small kernel of k—
mers that are common in usage either between two organisms or
among all of them.

On the other hand, the Hypothesis Test technique seems to be
able to capture subtler ‘k—mer nucleosome positioning signals”, since
the k—mer percentage is larger than the one contained in the Binary
Classification homologous. As it is discussed in the remainder of this
study, such a complementarity allows to obtain additional sequence
specific information with respect to what was already known in the
literature, while opening the way to explore a variety of k—mer usage
not available before and that accounts for organism specificity.

In the next two subsections, the dictionaries will be used to show
results coming from those two complementary levels of detail.

3.2.3 Binary classification dictionaries: a high level detail

A small kernel of k—mers significantly involved in the composition of
NER and NDRs, common to all organisms is reported in Table 3. It
has been obtained via a join of the base dictionaries studied in this
section. As evident from the discussion that follows, that kernel pro—
vides high level details about the role of k—mers in nucleosome pos—
itioning, specifically addressing the somewhat neglected topic of
conservation among organisms.

Figure 2 provides the sequence logos (Schneider and Stephens,
1990) obtained by aligning with CLUSTALW (Thompson et al.,
1994) the nucleosome favouring and disfavouring k—mers. As evi—
dent from the corresponding sequence logo, a poly(dA:dT)
tract emerges as a common feature of nucleosome disfavouring
k—mers. This is well known in the literature (Segal and Widom,
2009a). On the other hand, no such a definite high level com—
mon pattern emerges for nucleosome favouring k—mers. Those
facts suggest that, while poly(dA:dT) tracts are a ‘strong signature”
of nucleosome depletion shared by organisms, no analogous ‘signa—
ture” seems to exist for nucleosome formation, hinting that the latter
is more organism specific of the former as far as k—mers are
concerned.

At this ‘very discriminative” level of detail, our main contribu—
tion, which consists of providing novel organism and sequence spe—
cificity, clearly emerges from the comparison of our findings with
the ones of two existing studies, those latter being summarized next
for the convenience of the reader. They are related to this part of
our study because they either use the same Binary Classification ap—
proach (Peckham et al., 2007) or closely related machine learning
techniques (Tillo and Hughes, 2009), i.e. the Lasso feature selection
method (Tibshirani, 1996) (see again Section 2.2.1 for the relation
between Binary classification and feature selection in this context).

Peckham et al. (2007), in their study of nucleosome positioning
signals in genomic DNA, sigled out 31 k—mers that found of rele—
vance there. They were obtained by analyzing S.cereUisiae position—
ing maps that are quite different than the one considered here. That
study leaves open how conserved the role of those relevant k—mers is
across organisms. Our study can be used to provide an answer to
that important question. Indeed, quite remarkably, the vast majority
(24 out of 31) of the k—mers identified in the mentioned previous
study are common to all organisms considered here in the base
Binary Classification dictionary. Details are in Table S6 of the
Supplementary Material.

On the other hand, Tillo and Hughes (2009), in their study on
the construction of a simplified model for prediction of nucleosome
positioning from sequences, singled out 14 sequence features
deemed important for their model. They were extracted by using an
in vitro nucleosome map of S.cereUisiae by Kaplan et al. (2008).
Eleven of such features are 4—mers. We find that seven of them ap—
pear in all of our Binary Classification dictionaries. Moreover ten
out of such eleven 4—mers are present in the majority of the organ—
isms considered here. The exception is the k—mer found to be ‘the
least relevant” in the study by Tillo and Hughes (2009). It is worth
of mention that only four relevant k—mers are common to the study
by Peckham et al. (2007) and Tillo and Hughes (2009). Again, de—
tails are in Table S6 of the Supplementary Material.

In conclusion, regarding the assessment, via machine learning
techniques, of k—mer involvement in nucleosome positioning, our
study accounts for both studies just outlined on S.cereUisiae.
Moreover, it extends them both in terms of (i) organisms and (ii)
relevant k—mers common to all organisms.

3.2.4 Hypothesis test dictionaries: additional levels of detail

For the dictionaries studied in this section, we limit the analysis to a
very discriminative significance level, i.e. 2%. The level of detail
offered by this part of our study is novel.

For each of the Hypothesis Test dictionaries, the sets of k—mers
favouring/disfavouring nucleosome positioning, with the specified
significance level threshold, have been clustered separately via
DNACLUST (Ghodsi et al., 2011), with a sequence similarity
threshold of 75%, computed via standard semi—global alignment.
Table 4 reports the number of clusters so obtained, for each organ—
ism. It gives a synopsis of the variety of similar k—mers involved ei—
ther in favouring or disfavouring nucleosome positioning, with a
very high statistical significance. To the best of our knowledge, such
a classification is new in the literature.

The results of the clustering process provide a valuable hierarch—
ical access to the information contained in each Hypothesis Test dic—
tionary: the representatives and then the clusters. Those latter, being
composed of fairly similar sequences, can be used to highlight com—
mon sequence patterns for k—mers involved in nucleosome position—
ing. Significant examples of that are in Figure 3, showing the
sequence logos obtained via alignment with CLUSTALW of specific
clusters, corresponding to k—mers favouring or disfavouring nucleo—
some positioning. A more extensive set of analogous logos is pro—
vided in the Supplementary Material (Figs S7—S13). As opposed to
the high level detail reported in Figure 2 for nucleosome favouring
k—mers, patterns now emerge and they highlight that the G + C con—
tent as a determinant of nucleosome positioning is only a good ap—
proximation to a much more specific and complex set of sequence
patterns favouring nucleosome positioning (as an example, see the
first logo in Fig. 3). Likewise, the patterns that emerge for nucleo—
some disfavouring k—mers, are very much related to poly(dA:dT)
tracts only in S.cereUisiae and partly in C.elegans (see the second
and the fifth logos in Fig. 3). Although those types of patterns occur
in some of the considered organisms (e.g. fly and human), there are
patterns that substantially diverge from being poly(dA:dT) (as
shown by the third and fourth logos in Fig. 3). Quite remarkably,
this is in agreement with the finding that the 5—mer AAAAA is
strongly associated to nucleosome depletion in the yeast and in part
in the worm, but it has a much less positioning influence in both fly
and human (Radman—Livaja and Rando, 2009). Section 4.1 of the
Supplementary Material offers a quantitative assessment of this
point (Tables S7—S8).

Both qualitatively and quantitatively, our results suggest that
short poly(dA:dT) tracts are relatively important for nucleosome

Fig. 3. Sequence logos of (from up to down): The 95 aligned sequences in
Cluster 9, nucleosome favouring k—mers, for the worm; the 380 aligned se-
quences in Cluster 23, nucleosome disfavouring k—mers, for the yeast; the 223
aligned sequences in Cluster 12, and the 283 aligned sequences in Cluster 1,
nucleosome disfavouring k—mers, for the fly; the 45 aligned sequences in
Cluster 7, nucleosome disfavouring k—mers, for the worm

positioning in yeast and partly worm, in relation to other k—mers,
but such an importance seems to vanish in fly and human.

Moreover, the presence of short poly(dA:dT) and poly(dC:dG)
tracts in nucleosome forming patterns argues for the need of a better
understanding of the role of DNA deformation in relation to the en—
tire spectrum of biological processes where it plays a role, in agree—
ment with findings in (Johnson et al., 2013).

4 Conclusive remarks

The analysis reported here sheds light on how sequence composition
may influence nucleosome positioning. In particular, we have found
that nucleosome enriched and depleted regions are remarkably and
unexpectedly close in terms of their information—theoretic content,
and only small differences in their composition are responsible for
their functional diversity. To understand the organization of those
k—mers that are significant in favouring/disfavouring nucleosome
positioning, we have proposed a consistent paradigm useful to dis—
tinguish them according to two different points of view: one based
on Binary Classification, able to provide a more general and high
level description, and the other one relying on Hypothesis Test in
Statistics, able to provide more detailed information with respect to
Binary Classification. Thanks to the use of those two complemen—
tary views, we have both confirmed and extended what was already
known in the literature, showing that the scenario is richer in k—mers
variety than one could have expected. This opens the way to several
further directions of analysis. Notably among them, the application
of motif discovery techniques (e.g. Rombo, 2012; Parida et al.,
2014) to single out possible regularities among significant k—mers.
Moreover, special mention deserves the need for a comparative
study of k—mer involvement in nucleosome formation coming from
in vitro and in UiUO maps, as already pointed out in the

Introduction. That would be a natural complement and continu—
ation of the study reported here for in UiUO maps.

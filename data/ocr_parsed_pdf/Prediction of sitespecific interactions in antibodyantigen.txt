ABSTRACT

Motivation: Antibodies or immunoglobulins are proteins of paramount
importance in the immune system. They are extremely relevant as
diagnostic, biotechnological and therapeutic tools. Their modular
structure makes it easy to re-engineer them for speciﬁc purposes.
Short of undergoing a trial and error process, these experiments, as
well as others, need to rely on an understanding of the speciﬁc deter-
minants of the antibody binding mode.

Results: In this article, we present a method to identify, on the basis of
the antibody sequence alone, which residues of an antibody directly
interact with its cognate antigen. The method, based on the random
forest automatic learning techniques, reaches a recall and specificity
as high as 80% and is implemented as a free and easy-to-use server,
named prediction of Antibody Contacts. We believe that it can be of
great help in re-design experiments as well as a guide for molecular
docking experiments. The results that we obtained also allowed us to
dissect which features of the antibody sequence contribute most to
the involvement of specific residues in binding to the antigen.

1 INTRODUCTION

The past two decades have seen monoclonal antibody (mAb)
therapy come to age. With >30 molecules approved for clinical
practice and hundreds currently being tested, mAbs are rapidly
emerging as one of the most important classes of biological
therapeutics. Despite their beneﬁts, mABs obtained from both
human and xenogeneic sources have some deficiencies, such as
short in vivo life, low stability and high chances to raise an im-
munogenic reaction in patients. To overcome these hurdles, a
number of strategies based on genetic recombination have been
developed and optimized, which allow the modiﬁcation and
improvement of almost all the clinically relevant aspects of an
antibody molecule but require expensive and time-demanding
trial-and-error experimental procedures, a process that can be
speeded up by the understanding of the structure and binding
mode of the speciﬁc antibody (Morea et al., 2000). The antibody
molecule, with few exceptions, contains one or more tetramers of
two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, the heavy and the light

chains. Each chain consists of homologous domains, two for the
light chain (one variable and one constant domain) and four or
more for the heavy chain (one variable and three or more con-
stant domains). All the domains share a similar tertiary structure,
the so-called immunoglobulin fold, which is characterized by two
anti-parallel beta sheets. The antigen-binding site (ABS) is
mainly composed of six loops, three from the light and three
from the heavy chain [also known as the hypervariable (HV)
loops]. In a seminal study on antibody sequences (Wu and
Kabat, 1970), such large variability was exploited to correctly
deﬁne these HV sequence stretches as the complementarity deter-
mining regions (CDRs) in antibody recognition. Later studies
(Novotny et al., 1983) conﬁrmed that this deﬁnition largely over-
laps with the structurally based deﬁnition of the ABS. A number
of other biological mechanisms are in place to increase the
sequence diversity of antibody regions containing the ABS to
enlarge the size of the antibody repertoire, and therefore the
number of different antigens that can be targeted by the
immune system (Di Noia and Neuberger, 2007; Schatz and
Swanson, 2011; Teng and Papavasiliou, 2007).

Analyses of the rapidly growing number of antibody crystal
structures in complex with their antigens pointed out that, even
though almost all the intermolecular interactions are made by
residues in the CDR (Kunik et al., 2012; MacCallum et al.,
1996), the specific interaction pattern of each antibody depends
on a subset of residues within or outside the CDR regions that
are important either to maintain the correct three-dimensional
(3D) conformation (Narciso et al., 2011) or to specify the phy-
sicochemical environment of the ABS.

Knowing the role played by a speciﬁc residue is a key aspect in
antibody rational design and engineering. This information can
be inferred by analyzing the 3D structure of the antibody mol-
ecule or, when the latter is not available, by building and analyz-
ing its 3D model. Modeling of antibody structures is a ﬁeld that
has attracted much attention, and available methods can pro-
duce models of very good accuracy (Accelrys Software Inc.,
2012; Marcatili et al., 2008; Molecular Operating Environment,
2012; Sircar et al., 2009; Whitelegg and Rees, 2000). It should be
noted here that antibody structure prediction still has pitfalls,
mainly as far as the prediction of the conformation of the
third HV loop of the heavy chain is concerned (Kuroda et al.,
2012; Ramos, 2012; Sircar, 2012).

Despite the abundance of methods speciﬁcally devoted to the
prediction and analysis of antibodies (Lefranc et al., 2009), few
tools are available to provide information about the paratope,
i.e. the subset of residues that contact the antigen. Paratome
(Kunik et al., 2012) is a recently published online tool for

identiﬁcation of antigen-binding region that extends the deﬁn-
ition of CDRs to include contacts outside the canonical ABS
region. However, Paratome does not provide any information
on the speciﬁc residues that are directly involved in the binding,
on the type of interaction (hydrogen bond, hydrophobic and
other non-bonded interactions) or on the atoms involved in the
interaction (main chain, side chain or both). This information is
of relevance for any type of antibody engineering experiment,
such as in silico maturation.

To overcome this problem, we developed prediction of
Antibody Contacts (proABC), a web server for predicting
which residues of an antibody are involved in recognizing its
cognate antigen. It is based on a machine-learning method
trained on sequence and sequence-derived features. Starting
from the antibody sequence alone, proABC estimates, for each
residue in its sequence, the probability that it interacts with the
cognate antigen. Three different types of interaction are con-
sidered and predicted separately (hydrogen bond, hydrophobic
and other non-bonded interactions). The results are displayed in
an intuitive manner allowing an easy yet comprehensive exam-
ination of the residues that could directly interact with the anti-
gen (also known as speciﬁcity determining residues). proABC
also builds a 3D model of the antibody, in which residues are
colored according to their contact probability.

The server is available at http://www.biocomputing.it/pro
ABC.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

The two datasets used for training and testing the predictors contain 313
and 44 antibody-antigen complexes, respectively. We scanned the se-
quences of all the molecules contained in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
database (October 15, 2012) using isotype-speciﬁc Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) proﬁles developed by us (Chailyan et al., 2012) and
found 1294 antibody molecules. Using the PISCES web server (Wang
and Dunbrack, 2003), we removed all the structures with a resolution
worse than 3 A, ending up with 1139 molecules. Among them, we selected
all the immunoglobulins solved in complex with the antigen. This step
was performed by examining whether any atom not belonging to the
immunoglobulin light or heavy chain falls within a 10A radius from
the ABS barycenter. When such atoms were found, the antibody was
labeled as ‘bound’, and all the chains to which these atoms belong were
considered as ‘antigens’. Cases where non-immunoglobulin atoms were
present near the binding site but were not labeled with a different chain
identiﬁer (usually small molecules) were manually examined to deﬁne the
antigen/hapten.

Of the initial set of 1139 immunoglobulin structures, 637 were found to
be in a bound state. We removed all complexes where the immunoglobu-
lin sequence shared a sequence identity higher than 95% with any other
using the cd-hit software (Li and Godzik, 2006), and ended up with 313
antibody structures. This dataset (hereafter called ‘RF dataset’) was used
for the cross-validated training of the predictors.

To make an unbiased comparison of our results with those of
Paratome, we also trained a predictor using a dataset obtained from
the RF dataset after removing all the complexes in which the antibody
sequence shares >9S% sequence identity with antibodies deposited in the
PDB database after February 2011. The antibodies released between
February 2011 and October 2012 were collected in a third dataset (here-
after called ‘Validation dataset’) and culled to remove redundancy both
within the dataset and with the other datasets.

2.2 Interaction identiﬁcation

We calculated non-bonded contacts, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic
interactions for all the complexes using the software Ligplot (Wallace
et al., 1995) with default parameters. We also categorized these three
groups of interactions according to which atoms of the residue (side
chain and/or main chain) contact the antigen. We obtained 18 different
interaction tables containing the number of non-bonded contacts,
h-bonds and hydrophobic interactions occurring between an antigen
and a residue, its main chain alone and its side chain alone for both
the heavy and the light chain. We used each table to train a different
predictor for every combination of interaction types (cont, h-bond,
hydro), location of interaction (whole, main, side) and Ig chain (H, L).

2.3 Random forest analysis

We aligned, following the Chothia numbering scheme, the heavy and the
light chain sequences in the RF dataset using HMM profiles that we
developed earlier (Chailyan et al., 2012). For the H3 alignment, we fol-
lowed the method described in Lefranc et a]. (2003) and Morea et a].
(1998). The insertions were introduced at the center of the region com-
prised between the conserved residue Cys92 and Gly104 (Cyle4 and
Gly119 according to the international ImMunoGeneTics information
system (IMGT) numbering).

Each position of the heavy and the light chain multiple alignment was
considered as a variable; therefore, we had 135 variables for the heavy
chain and 12S variables for the light chain. In other words, we predicted
the binding properties of an amino acid (the target site) taking into
account all the amino acids in the chains.

Each position can host one of the 20 amino acids or a gap, resulting in
a 21-letter alphabet. We adopted two different encodings for the amino
acids. The ﬁrst strategy used the complete alphabet for all the variables
(predictor A). The second strategy (predictors B and C) used the complete
alphabet only for the target site and a reduced alphabet for all other
positions in the sequence. The B and C strategies differ for the inclu-
sion/exclusion of the antigen volume variable (see later in the text). We
chose a reduced alphabet based on the 11 amino acid classes described in
Pommie et a]. (2004) and reported in Table 1. In this 12-letter alphabet
(11 amino acid classes and the gap symbol), speciﬁcally derived for im-
munoglobulins, aromatic residues such as tyrosine, tryptophan and
phenylalanine as well as glycine and proline are considered as different
classes. This allows us to capture the pivotal role played by these amino
acids both in antibody antigen recognition (Birtalan et al., 2008; Koide

and Sidhu, 2009) and in maintenance of the ABS correct structural con-
formation (North et al., 2011).

2.4 Antigen volume

Several studies highlighted the correlation between antigen volume and
the shape of the ABS (Collis et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2006). Consequently,
we also evaluated the contribution of antigen volume to the overall per-
formance of our predictors. We determined the antigen volumes using the
3 V software (V055 and Gerstein, 2010) and found that the distribution of
the volumes of the antigens in our RF dataset is bimodal with a median
value of 1538 A3. Complexes were classiﬁed in two categories depending
on whether the antigen volume is larger or smaller than the median. This
variable was used in training predictors A and B.

2.5 Canonical structures and HV loop length

Hypervariable loops and their main chain conformations (canonical
structures) (Chothia and Lesk, 1987) are key parameters for antigen rec-
ognition. Five among the six loops (L1, L2, L3, H1, H2) adopt only few
canonical structures, while the H3 loop is the most variable in both se-
quence and structural conformation (Al-Lazikani et al., 1997; Morea
et al., 1998). We used the canonical structures and the HV loop length
as variables. These were obtained using the tools provided by the Digit
database (Chailyan et al., 2012).

We decided to use these variables that implicitly take into account the
3D structure of the antibody, rather than the modeled structure itself to
avoid biases arising from incorrect modeling of some parts of the mol-
ecule, especially the H3 loop.

2.6 Germline families

Germline heavy and light chain variable regions (VH and VL) gene germ-
line genes have been extensively used to study the biophysical properties
of different antibodies (Ewert et al., 2003) and for VH/VL packing pre-
diction (Chailyan et al., 2011a, b). We determined the source organism
and the germline family and included them as variables in our predictors
(Chailyan et al., 2012).

2.7 Random forest

In this study, we applied the R (v.4.6) implementation of the Random
Forest (randomForest package).

We built separate predictors for all the antibody positions that are in
contact with the antigen in at least 10 of the 313 complexes in our dataset.
For all the other positions, the proABC output is simply the frequency
with which the residue at that position interacts with the antigen in our
dataset. For each position, we generated 18 different predictors, taking
into account the type of interaction (non-bonded contact, h-bond, hydro-
phobic), the atoms involved in the interaction (whole residue, side chain
and main chain) and the Ig heavy and the light chain.

Predictors were built in two-steps. In the ﬁrst step, we used all the
variables reported in Table 2 and fed a forest of 1500 trees. The total
number of variables to be tested at each tree node (mtry) was set to its
default value (corresponding to the square root of the total number of
variables).

Mean decrease Gini (MDG) values resulting from this ﬁrst step were
ranked, and the average MDG was calculated (Chailyan et al., 2011a, b).
In the second step, we used only the features with an MDG value larger
than average MDG and built 1500 trees with default mtry. The entire
process was subjected to a 10-fold cross-validation.

Three different models, named A, B and C (Table 2), were developed
as described earlier in the text. For comparison, we also built a predictor
(naive predictor) trained on each position alone, independently of all the
others, using the 21-letter alphabet and building 100 trees. The results of

Note: The different sets of variables were adopted to train models A, B, C and the
naive predictor. All predictors use the complete amino acid alphabet to encode the
residue at the speciﬁc position for which the interaction is being predicted (‘Position’
column). The complete alphabet is used in model A to encode the whole sequence,
while the reduced 12—letter alphabet described in Table 1 is adopted in models B and
C (‘Sequence’ column). Models A, B and C share the same sequence-derived fea—
tures (canonical structures, HV loop length and germline family). The ‘Antigen
Volume’ binary variable, which labels antigens with a volume larger or smaller
than 1538 A3, is used only in models A and B.

the 10-fold cross-validation were evaluated using the following statistical
measures: Precision, Accuracy, Recall, Matthew’s correlation coefﬁcient
(MCC) and area under the curve (AUC).

2.8 Web interface
The web interface to the server is implemented in php and Jquery. Plots

and tables are generated with the R package GoogleVis v.0.33 (Gesmann
and de Castillo, 2011). Images are generated with Pymol (DeLano, 2002).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Performance evaluation

We compared the results of the three predictors with those ob-
tained using the naive predictor. The corresponding ROC curves
are shown in Figure 1, and the MCC and the AUC values for all
the models are shown in Table 3. In all cases, our models clearly
outperform the naive predictor indicating that information on
the whole antibody sequence effectively contributes to the pre-
diction performance. All predictors had similar values of AUC
and MCC for non-bonded contacts, whereas model B proved to
be better at predicting both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic
interactions (See Supplementary Fig. S1). We obtained a slightly
worse performance for main chain hydrophobic interactions and
hydrogen bonds, possibly because of the small number of these
interactions present in our dataset.

Despite the importance of antigen volume for the prediction of
some speciﬁc positions (as discussed later), predictor C still has a
good overall classiﬁcation ability. This gave us the possibility to
include the antigen volume as an optional feature in the proABC
web server, so that we use model B when the antigen volume is
known and model C in all other cases.

3.2 Variable importance

As shown in the previous section, the predictors that use all the
variables (sequence, antigen volume, canonical structures and
germline families) greatly outperform the naive one that only
takes into account the contact frequency and residue identity
at the target site.

Table 4 lists the 20 most important variables and their relative
contribution to the correct prediction of the target site inter-
actions. Supplementary Table S1 includes the complete list of
variables and their relative importance. The analysis of the
most important variables for speciﬁc target sites provides inter-
esting insights into the antibody ABS and the process of antigen
recognition. The antigen volume, for instance, is critical to cor-
rectly predict interactions with the N-terminals and C-terminals
of the H1 and L1 loops, whereas residues in the center of these
loops are inﬂuenced by the antigen volume to a signiﬁcantly
lower extent. These ﬁndings agree with a recently published ana-
lysis of the ABS anatomy (Raghunathan et al., 2012).

It has been noticed (Collis et al., 2003) that the H3 loop packs
with L1 in the ABS reducing the accessibility of its C-terminal
residues. Our data support this observation, as we observe a
correlation between the H3 length and the number of contacts
in the C-terminal region of L1, the shorter the loop, the
higher the number of contacts (Cu 2 —0.06H3Len+ 1.61,
P: 2.16 x 10—5, Pearson correlation coefﬁcient: 0.24).

3.3 Comparison with other methods

To the best of our knowledge, proABC is unique in its purpose.
The most similar tool is Paratome (Kunik et al., 2012), an online
tool for antigen-binding region identiﬁcation. The performance
of the two algorithms is evaluated here using the independent
validation set described in Methods section. The results are sum-
marized in Table 5. Paratome shows a very high total recall at
the expense of low precision and specificity. This can be ex-
plained considering the somewhat large threshold that
Paratome uses to deﬁne contacts (6.0A cut-off). This choice is
due to the fact that Paratome aims at defining a plausible region
of antigen binding rather than at predicting residue-speciﬁc inter-
actions. On the other hand, proABC, despite its lower recall,
outperforms Paratome in terms of precision and speciﬁcity.
The MCC of the two methods shows that, overall, proABC per-
forms significantly better.

3.4 Web server interface and 3D model

We integrated our predictors and several other tools, including a
routine to build a 3D model of the antibody (Marcatili et al.,
2008), in a web server with a user-friendly interface (http://www.
biocomputing.it/proABC). The web server includes six different
pages: (i) Home; (ii) Plot; (iii) Summary; (iv) High Quality (HQ)
figures; (V) Structure; and (Vi) Logs.

The main page allows the user to input the light and the heavy
chain sequences and, optionally, the antigen volume. The input is
pre—processed to obtain all the information that can be derived
from the sequence, namely germline families, canonical structures
and length of each HV loop, shown in the Summary page, and
passed to the relevant predictor. The web server uses predictor B
(that has the best overall performance) if the user provides infor-
mation on the antigen volume (smaller or larger than 1538 A3),
and predictor C if no information on the antigen volume is given.
The Plot page reports the results as graphs/tables listing the prob-
ability of each residue to interact with the antigen. The Summary
page also includes links to download the results and the
3D model. The Image and Structure tabs allow the users to Visu-
alize the antibody 3D model and high-quality images of the anti-
body in which residues are colored according to their contact

indicating which operations are being performed.

Figure 3 shows an example of application of the server. The
selected case is that of the humanized antibody Gevokizumab,
the crystal structure of which (both free and in complex with
its antigen interleukin-1 beta) has been recently solved

Gevokizumab. Residues are colored according to their predicted contact
probabilities (light gray to blue gradient for the light chain, dark gray to

(Blech et al., 2013), but was obviously not used for the prediction.
None of the antibodies in our dataset shares >75% sequence
identity with Gevokizumab. Figure 3 and Supplementary Table
S2 show the probabilities assigned by proABC to residues in the
Gevokizumab light and heavy chain sequences and highlights the
correct and incorrect predictions obtained in this example (con-
sidering a residue as predicted to be in contact if the correspond-
ing probability is >0.5). As can be seen, most of the predictions
are correct. proABC predicts a marginal role for the H1 loop and
a prominent role of H2 in antigen recognition. Interestingly, the
L3 loop is predicted to be the most important light chain region
for antigen binding, with four contacts and two rarely observed
main chain hydrogen bonds. This is what is observed in the crys-
tal structure of the complex.

On the other hand, two contacts in L1 (position 27 and 28)
were not predicted with high probability in this case. These two
residues are rarely observed to be in contact with the antigen (13
and 18 cases in our dataset, respectively) and therefore are very
difﬁcult to classify correctly, highlighting the importance of
increasing the number of solved structures of antibody com-
plexes to further improve the performance of our method.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we described a method for predicting the prob-
ability of site-speciﬁc interactions between an antibody and its
cognate antigen that reaches speciﬁcity and recall values of the
order of 80%. This implies that the predictions are sufﬁciently
accurate not only for investigating the properties of speciﬁc anti-
bodies, but also as input for the design of novel antibodies, for
example, in afﬁnity maturation projects, and as a guidance for
docking methods if the structure of the antigen is known or can
be modeled.

Interestingly, our data show that the prediction accuracy im-
proves when the complete sequence of the antibody rather than

Fig. 3. The results of the proABC server on the sequence of the humanized antibody Gevokizumab are compared with the experimentally observed
interactions computed using Ligplot on the solved structure of the antibody in complex with its cognate antigen (PDB code: 4G6M). The plots report
the non-bonded contact probability for each residue and, separately, for its side chain and its main chain. The same information is reported in a tabular
form as well. False positive predictions were made for H:100, H:95, H:50 (all and side) and H:96 (all and main), false negative predictions for H:32, L:50,
L:53, L:28, L:27 (all, side), H:57 (all, main) and H:58 (main) while the other predictions shown in Fig.3 are all true positives. Each residue for which
proABC returns an interaction probability higher than 0.5 is considered as a predicted contact

that of its binding site alone is taken into account. We could also
derive information about which position/features of the antibody
sequence inﬂuence the participation to the binding interface of
speciﬁc sites, thus permitting a detailed structural analysis of the
complex interplay between the framework and ABS in determin-
ing the speciﬁcity of the interaction, an issue of interest from
both a theoretical and practical point of View.

The main advantages of the method presented here are that (i)
it relies only on the sequence of the variable fragment of the
antibody of interest, (ii) it is able to take into account the size
of the antigen when the information is available and (iii) it can be
automatically updated as new data on the structure of antibody
complexes become available.

The associated server is straightforward to use and provides
publication-ready output images as well as information on
the properties of the analyzed immunoglobulin, including the
determination of the corresponding germline family and the
canonical structures and length of each HV loop. It also permits
the user to obtain a model of the 3D structure of the antibody
quickly and easily by using a well-tested and very accurate
method (Marcatili, et al., 2008). The server (http://www.
biocomputing.it/proABC) is free and open to all users and
there is no login requirement.

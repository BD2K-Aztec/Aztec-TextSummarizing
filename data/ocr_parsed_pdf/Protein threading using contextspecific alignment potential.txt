ABSTRACT

Motivation: Template-based modeling, including homology modeling
and protein threading, is the most reliable method for protein 3D struc-
ture prediction. However, alignment errors and template selection are
still the main bottleneck for current template-base modeling methods,
especially when proteins under consideration are distantly related.
Results: We present a novel context-specific alignment potential for
protein threading, including alignment and template selection. Our
alignment potential measures the log-odds ratio of one alignment
being generated from two related proteins to being generated from
two unrelated proteins, by integrating both local and global context-
specific information. The local alignment potential quantifies how well
one sequence residue can be aligned to one template residue based
on context-speciﬁc information of the residues. The global alignment
potential quantifies how well two sequence residues can be placed
into two template positions at a given distance, again based on con-
text-specific information. By accounting for correlation among a var-
iety of protein features and making use of context-specific information,
our alignment potential is much more sensitive than the widely used
context-independent or profile-based scoring function. Experimental
results confirm that our method generates significantly better align-
ments and threading results than the best profile-based methods on
several large benchmarks. Our method works particularly well for dis-
tantly related proteins or proteins with sparse sequence profiles be-
cause of the effective integration of context-speciﬁc, structure and
global information.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein structure is essential for the understanding of protein
functions. Predicting the 3D structure of a protein from its se-
quence remains one of the grand challenges confronting compu-
tational biologists. Template-based modeling (TBM), such as
homology modeling and protein threading, is the most reliable
method and can produce reasonable 3D models for about two-
third of the proteins without solved structures. TBM is based on
the observation that protein structures are much more conserved
than sequences. That is, given a target protein sequence, we can
predict its 3D structure by aligning it to structurally similar pro-
tein structures in PDB. The model quality of TBM depends on
sequence-template alignment and template selection, both of
which are challenging when only distantly related templates are
available for a protein sequence under prediction.

The threading accuracy critically depends on the choice of a
threading scoring function (Meng et al., 2011). Most of current
methods make heavy use of position-speciﬁc information, such
as sequence proﬁle, which is usually represented as a position-

speciﬁc scoring matrix or a proﬁle HMM (Eddy, 1998; Eskin and
Snir, 2007; Jaroszewski et al., 2005; Séding, 2005). Although
sequence proﬁle is effective on homolog detection, it is only pos-
ition speciﬁc, but not context speciﬁc. Further, it is also lack of
structure information (e. g. secondary structure and solvent
accessibility). Context-specific information refers to the informa-
tion in the sequential neighborhood of one residue. The neigh-
boring residues of a given residue play an important role in
shaping the mutation pattern of the residue. Few alignment
methods, such as CS-BLAST (Biegert and Séding, 2009) are
developed to make use of context-speciﬁc information. Even
CS-BLAST makes use of only sequence, but not context-speciﬁc
structure information. To the best of our knowledge, no protein
threading method has integrated well both context-speciﬁc
sequence and structure information.

Although many protein alignment methods use only local in-
formation, a few protein threading methods (Akutsu and
Miyano, 1999; Godzik et al., 1992; Jones et al., 1992; Xu et al.,
2003) were developed to use global information, such as pairwise
contact potential, which quantiﬁes how well two sequence resi-
dues can be placed into two template positions in a contact.
However, the gain from pairwise contact potential is not signifi-
cant as compared with the impact of sequence proﬁle on protein
alignments. The underlying reason may be that the contact-based
pairwise potentials used in these threading methods do not carry
too much extra signal. To signiﬁcantly improve the effectiveness
of global information especially pairwise potential in protein
threading, this article studies a context-speciﬁc distance-based
pairwise potential. Our pairwise potential is built on context-spe-
ciﬁc information and much more sensitive than the context-in-
dependent contact—based pairwise potentials and, thus, greatly
helps improve protein threading.

This article presents a novel context-speciﬁc alignment poten-
tial for protein threading, including both alignment and template
selection. Our alignment potential measures the log-odds ratio of
one alignment being generated from two related proteins to
being generated from two unrelated proteins, by integrating con-
text-speciﬁc local and global information. An alignment is
assumed to be optimal if it maximizes the alignment potential.
The local alignment potential quantifies how well one sequence
residue can be aligned to one template residue based on context-
speciﬁc information of these two residues. The global alignment
potential quantiﬁes how well two sequence residues can be
placed into two template positions at a given distance, again
based on residue context-speciﬁc information.

In this article, the context of one residue includes a variety of
correlated protein features, such as sequence (proﬁle) informa-
tion, (predicted) secondary structure and solvent accessibility,
amino acid physio-chemical properties in a local window cen-
tered at the residue. We integrate these correlated protein fea-
tures into an accurate alignment potential using advanced
statistical learning methods, including conditional neural fields

(Peng et al., 2009). Experimental results show that our context-
speciﬁc alignment potential is much more sensitive than the
widely used context-independent or profile-based (which is pos-
ition speciﬁc) scoring function, generating signiﬁcantly better
alignments and threading results than the best proﬁle-based
methods on several large benchmarks. Our method works par-
ticularly well for distantly related proteins or proteins with sparse
sequence proﬁles because of the effective integration of context-
speciﬁc, structure and global information.

2 METHODS

2.1 Protein alignment potential

We represent one alignment A between two proteins as a sequence of
alignment states a1, a2, . . . , (Q, where L is the alignment length and a,- is
the alignment state at position i. There are three possible alignment states
M, I, and I ,, where M represents two residues being aligned, I, denotes an
insertion in the template and I, denotes an insertion in the sequence.

2.1.] Deﬁnition of alignment potential Similar to many amino acid
substitution matrices, such as BLOSUM (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992)
and PAM (Dayhoff, 1978), which deﬁne the mutation potential of two
amino acids, we deﬁne the potential of one protein alignment. Given a
protein sequence S and a template T and one of their alignments A, let
P(A|S, 7) denote the probability of A being generated from S and Tusing
our alignment method. We deﬁne the potential of A, denoted as
U(A|S, T), as follows.

U(AIT, 5) = 10g(P(A|S, T)/Pref(A)) (1)

where P,,.,«(A) is the background (or reference) probability of A, i.e. the
probability of A being generated from two randomly selected proteins
with the same lengths as S and T, respectively. Intuitively, an alignment is
good as long as its probability is much better than the expected probabil-
ity. We assume that an alignment is optimal if it maximizes its potential.
That is, given a sequence and a template, we can ﬁnd their optimal align-
ment by maximizing the alignment potential function.

We use a recently developed probabilistic graphical model conditional
neural ﬁelds (Peng et al., 2009) to calculate P(A|S, T) as follows (Ma
et al., 2012),

exp(F(A|T, S, 9) + wG(A|T, S, 6))

P(AIT, S, 9) _  (2)
where 6 is the model parameter vector to be trained, w (= 1.0) is a weight
factor and Z(T, S, 6) is the normalization factor (i.e. partition function)
summing over all possible alignments for a given protein pair. For the
purpose of simplicity, we omit 6 in the following sections unless we have
to spell it out. The function F estimates the log-likelihood of one sequence
residue being aligned to one template residue based on the input protein
features. The function G estimates the log-likelihood of a pair of sequence
residues being placed into two template positions at a given distance
based on the input protein features. The functions F and G are called
local and global alignment functions, respectively.

Once the forms of F(A|T,S) and G(A|T,S) are determined, we can
train their parameters by maximum-likelihood. That is, given a set of
training protein pairs and their reference alignments (built by a structure
alignment tool), we maximize their occurring probability deﬁned by
Equation (2). However, as G(A|T,S) is a global alignment function, it
is computationally hard to directly maximize Equation (2). In addition, it
may cause overﬁtting by training the parameters of F and G simultan-
eously, as the parameter space is big. To avoid these problems, we deter-
mine the parameters of functions F and G separately, which will be
explained in the following sections.

2.1.2 Reference State We can calculate the reference alignment prob-
ability Pref(A) in Equation (1) by randomly sampling a set of protein
pairs, each with the same lengths as the sequence S and template T,
respectively, and then estimate the probability of alignment A based on
these randomly sampled protein pairs. As long as we generate sufﬁcient
number of samplings, we shall be able to approximate P,,.,«(A) well. Here,
we use the geometric mean to approximate the reference state as follows,

MA) = ,"i 11:, P(AIX, Y) (3)

where N is the number of samplings and X and Y represent two sampled
proteins with the same lengths as S and T, respectively. Combining
Equation (173), the potential of one alignment A can be calculated as
follows.

U(A|S, T) = 10g(P(A|S, D/me(A))

= Iog(P(Ais, 7W 11:, P(AIX, 1)) (4)

: exp(F(A | T, S) + wG(A| T, S))/Z(T, S)
yexpmAiX. n + wG(Aix, n)/Z(X, Y)

Note that an alignment is represented as a sequence of three states
(match state M, insertion state at sequence I, and insertion state at tem-
plate I,), e.g. MMMMM ISIS MMMM I, I, 1,. Therefore, given two se-
quencetemplate pairs (S, T) and (X, Y), as long as S and Thave the same
lengths as X and Y, respectively, the alignment space (i.e. the set of all
possible alignments) for S and Tis the same as that for X and Y. That is,
any S-to-T alignment is also a feasible alignment between X and Y,
although it may have different probabilities. Conversely, any X-to-Y
alignment is also a feasible alignment between S and T

By deﬁnition, Z(S, T) is equal to the alignment space size times the
mean value of the denominator in Equation (2). As S and T have the
same alignment space as X and Y, Z(S, T) differs from Z(X, Y) only in
the mean values of their corresponding denominators in Equation (2),
which is independent of any speciﬁc alignment, but it may depend on
protein residue composition. Therefore, we have,

U(A|S, 7) = (F(AIT, S) — EXPx, yF(A|X, Y))
+ w(G(A|T, S)) — EXPX, y(G(A|X, Y)) + C(T, S)

 

 

(5)

where EXP is the expectation operator, the ﬁrst term of Equation (5) can
be interpreted as local alignment potential and the second term can be
interpreted as global alignment potential.

In Equation (S), ((5, 7) depends on only the residue composition of S
and Tbut not any speciﬁc alignment. In particular, ((5, T) is equal to 0 if
the sampled protein pairs have similar residue composition as S and T.
As such, for the purpose of ﬁnding the optimal alignment between S and
T, we can simply ignore ((5, 7). Therefore, the key challenge is to deter-
mine the local and global alignment potential functions in the right-hand
side of Equation (5).

2.2 Local alignment potential

The function F in Equation (2) estimates the log-likelihood of one pair of
residues being aligned based on their context-speciﬁc information. We
represent an alignment A as a1,a2,...,aL where L is the alignment
length aH and a,- are the alignment state at position i. As shown in
Figure 1, we use a linear-chain context-speciﬁc conditional neural ﬁeld
to calculate F as follows.

F(A|T, S) = Z; E(a,-,1, a,, T, S) (6)

where the function E is a neural network with one hidden layer, estimat-
ing the log-likelihood of state transition from aH and a,- based on protein
features in a local window (of size 11) centered at the two residues to be
aligned. As in total there are nine possible state transitions in an

alignment position, the likelihood of state transition is calculated from
context-speciﬁc information by a neural network. The hidden neurons
non-linearly transform the input features

alignment, we need nine different neural networks, each corresponding to
one type of state transition.

We use the maximum-likelihood method to train the parameters in
function E(a,-,1, (1,, T, S). That is, given a set of reference alignments, we
maximize their occurring probability deﬁned later in the text.

P(A| T, S, 9) = exp(Z:1 E(a,-,1,a,-, T, S))/Z(T, S) (7)

where Z ( T,S ) is the partition function. This maximization problem can
be solved using the L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) (i.e. limited-
memory BFGS) algorithm, one of the quasi-Newton methods. Instead
of exactly calculating the Hessian matrix required by the Newton’s
method, BFGS approximates the inverse Hessian matrix to speed-up.
We use a L2-norm regularization factor to restrict the search space of
model parameters to avoid overﬁtting. The regularization factor is deter-
mined by S-fold cross-validation.

Once the parameters of E(a,-,1,a,-, T, S) are trained, the expectation
term EXPX, yF(A|X, Y) in Equation (5) can be calculated in advance by
uniformly sampling a few thousand protein pairs. As the function
E(a,-,1,a,-, T, S) depends on only a local window of protein features (i.e.
independent of protein length), we do not need to calculate
EXP X, yF(A|X , Y) for each protein pair to be aligned, which saves a lot
of computational time.

2.2.] Protein features The features we use for E(a,-,1, (1,, T, S) include
sequence similarity measured by BLOSUM (Henikoff and Henikoff,
1992), proﬁle similarity, structure-derived amino acid substitution
matrix (Tan et al., 2006), statistical potential-derived amino acid similar-
ity matrix (Prlic et al., 2000), three-class and eight-class secondary struc-
ture similarity and three-state solvent accessibility similarity. The
secondary structure and solvent accessibility of a template protein is
calculated by DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983). We predict the three-
class and eight-class secondary structure types of a target protein using
PSIPRED (McGufﬁn et al., 2000) and our in-house tool RaptorX-SS8
(Wang et al., 2011), respectively. We predict solvent accessibility of a
target protein using our in-house tool. For each residue, we use all
these features in a local window of size 11. In addition, all the similarity
scores are computed as potentials. For example, let SS,- and SS, denote the
secondary structure types at sequence position i and template position j,
respectively. The secondary structure similarity score for these two pos-
itions is calculated as [0g(P(SS,-,.S'S/)/P(SSi) P(SS/)).

We do not use an afﬁne gap penalty. Instead we use context-speciﬁc
gap penalty depending on the following features: sequence proﬁle, amino
acid identity, hydropathy index, both three-class and eight-class second-
ary structure and three-state solvent accessibility. For disordered regions,
no structure information is used.

2.3 Global alignment potential

The function G estimates the log-likelihood of a pair of sequence residues
being placed to two template positions at a given distance. Instead of
using a contact-based pairwise potential, here, we use a distance-based
pairwise potential. We calculate the log-likelihood function G(A| T, S) as
2, <1. log P(daT. |S,-,Sj) and the expectation item in Equation (5)
EXPX, yF(A|X, Y) as 2, <1. log P,,.f(d,’.j) where i and j are two aligned
positions, ail—1T. is the CD, distance of the template residues at these two
aligned positions, P(dgrlsi, Sj) is the probability of two sequence residues
S,- and S, being placed to two template positions at distance  and P,,.f(d,.JT.)
is the background probability of ,
statistics. Therefore, the pairwise alignment potential is calculated as
follows,

which can be calculated by simple

1 P (dTISi, Sj)
A T — EXP A X = — 1 ’1— 8
G( i .S) “a i .10 LZ,<,og Prefab ()

where L is the alignment length. As there are 0(L2) pairwise terms
in right-hand side of Equation (8), we normalize it by L so that the
global alignment potential has the same scale as the local alignment
potential.

To calculate P(daT. |S,-, Sj) in Equation (8), we use the following equation,

P(d,-,T-ls,-, s1) = 2,,P(c1,§id§)P(d3ici.C,-) (9)

where d}:- represents the distance of the two sequence residues at the two
aligned positions, P(darldg.) is the conditional probability of ail—1T. on d}:- and
P(d; |C,-, C1) is the conditional probability of the distance on the template
estimated from the contexts (denoted C,- and C1) of the two sequence
residues. The intuition underlying Equation (8) is that if the alignment
is good, the distance of a sequence residue pair shall match well with that
of their aligned template residue pair. The conditional probability of
Equation (9) can be calculated as P(darldg) = P(dar,d;§.)/P(d§) using the
chain rule. Where P(d3)(= P,,.f(d,JT.)) is the background probability, and
P015,
residue pairs and can be calculated by simple statistics using a set of non-
redundant protein structure alignments generated by our in-house tool
DeepAlign (Wang et al., 2013). As the distance between two sequence
residues is unknown, we predict P(dglCi, C,) using a probabilistic neural

d?) is the joint probability of the pairwise distances of two aligned

network (PNN) implemented in our context-specific distance-dependent
statistical potential package EPAD (Zhao and Xu, 2012). EPAD takes as
input the contexts of two sequence residues and yields their distance
probability distribution. The context of one residue includes sequence
proﬁle, predicted secondary structure and amino acid chemical properties
in a local window centered at this residue.

Unlike previous threading methods that make use of contact-based
pairwise potentials (Alexandrov et al., 1996; Lathrop and Smith, 1996;
Miyazawa and Jernigan, 1996; Xu et al., 2003), we use a context-speciﬁc
distance-based pairwise potential. Our pairwise potential is distance based
and makes use of context-speciﬁc information; therefore, it is much more
accurate than the context-independent contact-based potentials. The
EPAD package was implemented before CASPlO started and has been
blindly tested in CASPlO for template free modeling. The CASPlO results
show that EPAD can successfully fold some targets with unusual fold
(according to the CASPlO Free Modeling assessor Dr B. K. Lee). Our
large-scale experimental test also indicates EPAD is much better than
those context-independent distance-based pairwise potentials, such as
DOPE (Shen and Sali, 2009), DFIRE (Zhou and Zhou, 2009) and RW
(Zhang and Zhang, 2010) in ranking protein alignments (or template-
based models) generated by both threading and structure alignment
tools (Zhao and Xu, 2012).

3 RESULTS

Training and validation data: We constructed the training and
validation data from BC40, a subset of PDB, in which any two
proteins share <40% sequence identity. In total, we use a set of
1800 protein pairs as the training data, which covers most of the
folds in the SCOP database, and a set of 500 protein pairs as the
validation data. There is no redundancy between the training and
validation data (i.e. <40% sequence identity). The training and
validation data have the following properties: (i) all the proteins
have lengths <400 and contain <10% of residues with missing
coordinates; (ii) the TM-score (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) of a
protein pair is uniformly distributed from 0.55 to 1; and (iii) we
use our in-house structure alignment tool DeepAlign (Wang
et al., 2013) to generate the reference alignment for a protein
pair. Each alignment has fewer than 50 middle gaps, and the
number of terminal gaps is <20% of the alignment length.

Test data for alignment: We use the following three datasets to
test the alignment accuracy of our method.

(1) Set6K: a set of ~6000 protein pairs. Any two target pro-
teins in this set share <40% sequence identity. The TM-
score of a protein pair is uniformly distributed between
0.55 and 0.8. Two proteins in a pair have small length
difference. The protein pairs in Set6K have 5% of overlap
with our training and validation data. By ‘overlap’ we
mean that the proteins in one pair have sequence identity
30750% with those in another pair.

(2) Set4K: a set of 4547 protein pairs. Any two target proteins
in the set share <25% sequence identity. The protein pairs
in Set4K have 3% of overlap with our training and valid-
ation data. Two proteins in a pair have length difference
>30%; therefore, this set can be used to test whether the
domain boundary is correctly aligned.

(3) Set180K: a very large set of 179 390 protein pairs. Any two
proteins in most pairs share <40% sequence identity. The
TM-score of a protein pair is uniformly distributed be-
tween 0 and 1. Note that the size of our training set is
only 1% of this large set; therefore, the test result on
this set is unlikely biased by the training set.

Test data for threading: We use the following two datasets to
test the threading accuracy of our method.

(1) Set 1000x 6000: a large set constructed from PDB25,
which consists of ~6000 proteins. All the proteins in
PDB25 are used as templates, and 1000 of them are ran-
domly chosen as the target proteins. We predict the 3D
structure for all the 1000 targets using the ~6000 tem-
plates, but excluding self-threading.

(2) CASP10: a set of 123 test proteins. We use the CASP of-
ficial domain boundary deﬁnition for each test protein.

Evaluation criteria and programs to compare: We evaluate our
threading method using both reference-dependent and reference-
independent alignment accuracy. The reference-dependent accur-
acy is deﬁned as the percentage of correctly aligned positions
judged by the reference alignments, which are built using our
in-house tool DeepAlign (Wang et al., 2013). We also built the
reference alignments using other structure alignment tools, such

as DALI, Matt and TMalign (Holm and Sander, 1993; Menke
et al., 2008; Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) and observed similar
performance trend. To evaluate the reference-independent align-
ment accuracy, we build a 3D model for the target protein using
MODELLER (Sali et al., 2004) from its alignment to the tem-
plate and then evaluate the quality of the resultant 3D model
using TM-score. TM-score ranges from 0 to 1, indicating the
worst and best model quality, respectively. As our ultimate
goal is to predict 3D structure for a target protein, reference-
independent alignment accuracy is more important than refer-
ence-dependent accuracy. We compare our method with the
top-notch profile-based method HHalign, which is run with the
option ‘-mact 0.1’.

As shown in Table 1, our method outperforms HHalign in
terms of both reference-dependent and reference-independent
alignment accuracy on the two benchmarks Set6K and Set4K.
On these two sets, our method outperforms HHalign by 13.6 and
9%, respectively, in terms of the model quality (i.e. reference-
independent accuracy). In terms of reference-dependent accur-
acy, our method is better than HHalign by only 8.8 and 5.2%,
which is not as big as reference-independent accuracy. We
also calculate the reference-dependent accuracy on Set6K and
Set4K by allowing four-position off the exact match, as shown
in Table 2, which indicates that our method is still much better
than HHalign when four-position off the exact match is allowed.

As shown in Table 3, on the very large Set180K set, our
method yields slightly better performance than HHalign when
two proteins under consideration are similar. This is not surpris-
ing, as most methods can generate pretty good alignments for
two closely related proteins. When the TM-score of two proteins
under consideration falls into [0.65, 0.80], our method outper-
forms HHalign by ~3.3% in terms of the reference-dependent
accuracy and by ~7.6% in terms of the reference-independent
accuracy. When the TM-score of two proteins under consider-
ation falls into [0.40, 0.65], our method outperforms HHalign by
~9.4% in terms of the reference-dependent accuracy and by
~11.3% in terms of the reference-independent accuracy.

When the TM-score of two proteins falls into [0.25, 0.40], our
method outperforms HHalign by a very large margin in terms of
reference-dependent alignment accuracy. However, in terms
of the reference-independent alignment accuracy, the advantage
of our method is not as big, although it is still substantial. This
may be because that MODELLER cannot build a reasonable
model from an alignment with too many errors. By the way,
when the TM-score of two proteins is <0.4, it may not be so
important to generate an accurate alignment for them, as the
resultant 3D model has low quality and, thus, will not be useful.

Threading performance on a large test set: We test the thread-
ing performance of our method and HHpred on Set 1000 x 6000.
We run both our method and HHpred to predict the 3D struc-
ture for each of the 1000 targets using the ~6000 templates.
HHpred is run with its ‘realign’ option. That is, HHpred ﬁrst
searches through the template database using local alignment
and then re-aligns a target to the top templates using global
alignment. By doing so, HHpred can improve its modeling
accuracy a little bit over the default mode. To speed-up, our
method ﬁrst aligns a target to all the templates using only the
local alignment potential and then ranks all the templates using
both the local and global alignment potentials described in

Section 2. After ranking, only the ﬁrst-ranked templates are used
to build a 3D model by MODELLER for each target.

As shown in Figure 2, our method is significantly better than
HHpred when the targets are not so easy (i.e. the HHpred model
has TM-score <0.7). On the 1000 targets, our method and
HHpred obtain average TM-score 0.566 and 0.517, respectively.
Our method outperforms HHpred no matter whether the target
is easy or hard. If we exclude the 170 easy targets (i.e. either our
model or HHpred model has TM-score >0.8) from consider-
ation, the accumulative TM-score obtained by our method and
HHpred is 0.524 and 0.451, respectively. That is, our method is
~16.1% better than HHpred. Further, as indicated by the yellow
lines in Figure 3, our method can generate models with TM-score
>0.5 for many targets for which HHpred fails to generate a

TM- scare at our method

score. Each blue column shows the number of targets for which our
method is better by a given margin. Each red column shows the
number of targets for which HHpred is better by a given margin

model with TM-score >0.5. We use TM-score=0.5 as a cut-
off because when a model has TM-score >0.5, its overall fold
is basically correct.

As shown in Figure 3, our method generates models better
than HHpred by at least 0.05 for 342 targets, whereas HHpred
is better than our method by this margin for only 93 targets.
Further, the number of targets for which our method generates
models better than HHpred by at least 0.10 is 197, whereas
HHpred is better than our method by this margin for only 49
targets. In summary, our method has a large advantage over
HHpred on hard targets.

Threading performance on CASP10 data set: We further evalu-
ate the threading performance of our method on the most recent
CASP10 targets. We use the CASP ofﬁcial domain boundary
deﬁnition for each target, and in total there are 123 test proteins.
To make the test as fair as possible, both our method and
HHpred used the same set of templates and the same protein
sequence database (i.e. NR), which were constructed before
CASP10 started.

As shown in Figure 4, similar to what we have observed on the
large threading test set, our method significantly outperforms
HHpred when the targets are not so easy. Our method generates
a model with TM-score >0.5 for a few targets for which HHpred
fails to generate a model with TM-score >0.5. On the whole test

generated by our method (y-axis) and HHpred (x-axis), respectively

set, our method and HHpred obtain accumulative TM-score
77.52 and 70.65, respectively. If we exclude the ‘Server’ targets
from consideration and only look at the more challenging
‘Human/Server’ targets. The average TM-score obtained by
our method and HHpred is 0.63 and 0.57, respectively. That is,
our method is ~10.5% better than HHpred.

It is challenging to fairly compare our single-template thread-
ing method with the CASP10-participarting servers because that
most of the CASP10 servers used a hybrid method instead of an
individual threading method. For example, the first-ranked
Zhang-Server integrated both consensus analysis of ~10 individ-
ual threading programs and fragment-based 3D model building
technique. The top-ranked HHpred server integrated new proﬁle
generation method, multi-template alignment and a better 3D
model building technique. The top-ranked Robetta server used
consensus results from three programs, including HHpred,
RaptorX and SPARKS and also a new 3D model building
method. Our RaptorX server, which is ranked No. 2 overall,
used multiple-template threading, which can generate better 3D
models than single-template threading for many targets espe-
cially the easy ones. In summary, the accumulative TM-score
obtained by our single-template threading method described in
this article is only 0.85 less than what was obtained by RaptorX
in CASP10. It can be ranked No. 6 among all the CASP10-
participating servers.

P—value: It is desirable that any structure prediction program
can assign a confidence score to predicted models. Here, we use
P—value to quantify the relative quality of the top-ranked tem-
plates and alignments. To calculate the P—value, we use a set of
reference templates, which consist of ~1800 single-domain tem-
plates with different SCOP folds. Given a target, we ﬁrst thread
it to this reference template database and then estimate an ex-
treme value distribution from the ~1800 alignment scores (i.e.
alignment potentials). Based on this distribution, we calculate the
P—value of each alignment when threading the target to the real
template database. The P—value actually measures the quality of
the template (and the alignment) by comparing it with the refer-
ence templates.

To measure the real model quality, we use both GDT (Global
Distance Test) (Zemla et al., 1999) and uGDT (i.e. un-normal-
ized GDT). GDT has been used as an ofﬁcial measure by CASP

for many years. It measures the quality of a model by comparing
it with the native and outputs a value from 0 to 100, indicating
the worst and the best quality, respectively. uGDT is equal to
GDT times the target length divided by 100. uGDT is more
suitable when a large or multi-domain target protein can only
be partially covered by good templates. In this case, GDT is
likely to be small and not a good indicator even if the templates
are closely related to the target, as GDT is normalized by the
whole target length. However, uGDT is not good for a target
with length smaller than 100. For example, when a target of 60
residues is covered by a template perfectly on 48 of the 60 resi-
dues, the uGDT of this alignment is 48, whereas the GDT is 80.
In this case, GDT is more suitable than uGDT. In summary, we
use max (uGDT,GDT) to measure the model quality. We say one
alignment is reasonable when its resultant model has uGDT or
GDT >50. We use 50 as a cut-off because that many proteins
similar at only the fold level have GDT or uGDT ~50.

As shown in Figure 5, the P—value is a reliable indicator of
model quality. When P—value is small (i.e. <10_5), the models
have uGDT or GDT: 50. Even if P—value is <10T4, there are
few models that have both uGDT and GDT<50. That is, the
prediction from our threading method is reliable when the
P—value is <10T4.

Contribution of the distance-based pairwise potential: To evalu-
ate the contribution of our pairwise potential to alignment ac-
curacy, we calculate the accuracy improvement resulting from
adding our pairwise potential to the alignment potential using
two benchmarks Set6K and Set4K. As shown in Table 4, our
pairwise potential can improve reference-dependent accuracy by
3% and reference-independent accuracy by 0.01, respectively.
We have not fully exploited the power of our pairwise alignment
potential because it is computationally expensive. We just used
our pairwise potential to refine the alignment generated by local
alignment potential as follows. For each aligned position gener-
ated by our local potential, we allow it to move at most four
positions to improve the total potential (i.e. local poten-
tial+pairwise potential). We expect that a more efﬁcient pair-
wise potential optimization algorithm that can search a larger
alignment space will further improve the alignment accuracy.

We also evaluate the contribution of our pairwise potential to
template selection. To speed-up, we generate alignments using
our local alignment potential, and then rank all the templates
using a linear combination of our local and pairwise alignment
potentials (with equal weight). Experimental results on the
1000 x 6000 threading set and the CASP10 set indicate that the
pairwise potential indeed improves template selection, as shown
in Figures 6 and 7. On the 1000 x 6000 set, the average TM-score
increases from 0.547 to 0.566 when the pairwise potential is used
to rank the templates. On the CASP10 set, the accumulative TM-
score increases from 75.58 to 77.52 when the pairwise potential is
used. As shown in Figures 6 and 7, the context-speciﬁc pairwise
potential is particularly helpful to hard targets.

Case study: Here, we use two speciﬁc examples to further
demonstrate the strength of our method. Both of these two
cases are from our Set6K benchmark. The first example is to
align two proteins 3anA and 2gffA, which have TMscore be-
tween 0.62 and 0.65 according to the structural alignments gen-
erated by TM-align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005), Matt (Menke
et al., 2008), Dali (Holm and Sander, 1993) and our in-house tool

correctly align >90% of the positions judged by the reference
alignment (regardless of which structural alignment tools are
used to generate it). In contrast, HHalign fails to align the
second a and 13 segments. This is partially because HHalign
favors generating short alignment. If we choose 3anA as the

Fig. 8. Two alignments between 3anA and 2gffA generated by our
method and HHalign. The blue and red colors demonstrate correctly
aligned regions judged by the reference alignment. To save space, only
one of the domains of 3anA is shown

from our method and HHalign have TM-score 0.63 and 0.25,
respectively.

We use another two proteins 3k53A and lcb7A to showcase
that our method and HHalign generate two alignments of nearly
the same length, but our alignment has much better quality. As
shown in Figure 9, our method aligns nearly 80% of positions
correctly, whereas HHalign fails to align any position correctly.
If we use 3k53A as the template to build models for lcb7A, the
resultant 3D models from our method and HHalign have TM-
score 0.64 and 0.22, respectively. We can also examine the align-
ments visually. As shown in Figure 10A and B, our method
aligns the local structure well, whereas HHalign seemingly pro-
duces a totally wrong alignment. In this case, both 3k53A and
lcb7A have pretty good sequence profile information, and the
predicted secondary structure for lcb7A is also accurate (>80%).

This article has presented a novel protein threading method using
a context-speciﬁc alignment potential, which measures the

proteins to being generated from two unrelated proteins.
Intuitively, an alignment is regarded as good only when its esti-
mated probability is much higher than the expected. Our align-
ment potential integrates both local and global context-speciﬁc
and structure information through advanced machine learning
techniques, such as conditional neural ﬁelds, which can combine
a variety of highly correlated protein sequence and structure fea-
tures, without worrying too much about overcounting and
undercounting of features. Experimental results show that our
context-specific alignment potential is much more sensitive than
the widely used context-independent (e.g. profile-based) scoring
function and yields signiﬁcantly better alignments and threading
results. Our method works particularly well for distantly related
proteins or proteins with sparse sequence proﬁles because of the
effective integration of context-speciﬁc, structure and global
information.

This article also shows that our context-specific distance-based
pairwise potential is helpful to protein threading, as opposed to
the contact-based potentials previously used by some protein
threading methods. Combined with our context-speciﬁc local

alignment potential, our distance-based pairwise potential can
help improve both alignment accuracy and template selection
especially for hard targets. We expect that a more efﬁcient algo-
rithm that can optimize the pairwise potential better will yield
more accurate alignments.

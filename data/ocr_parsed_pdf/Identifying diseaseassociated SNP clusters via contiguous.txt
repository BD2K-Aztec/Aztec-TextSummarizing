ABSTRACT

Motivation: Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
have identified many disease-susceptibility single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), these findings can only explain a small
portion of genetic contributions to complex diseases, which is
known as the missing heritability. A possible explanation is that
genetic variants with small effects have not been detected. The
chance is <8% that a causal SNP will be directly genotyped. The
effects of its neighboring SNPs may be too weak to be detected
due to the effect decay caused by imperfect linkage disequilibrium.
Moreover, it is still challenging to detect a causal SNP with a small
effect even if it has been directly genotyped.

Results: In order to increase the statistical power when detecting
disease-associated SNPs with relatively small effects, we propose
a method using neighborhood information. Since the disease-
associated SNPs account for only a small fraction of the entire
SNP set, we formulate this problem as Contiguous Outlier DEtection
(CODE), which is a discrete optimization problem. In our formulation,
we cast the disease-associated SNPs as outliers and further impose
a spatial continuity constraint for outlier detection. We show that
this optimization can be solved exactly using graph cuts. We also
employ the stability selection strategy to control the false positive
results caused by imperfect parameter tuning. We demonstrate its
advantage in simulations and real experiments. In particular, the
newly identified SNP clusters are replicable in two independent
datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION

For the purpose of understanding complex diseases, genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) use high-throughput technologies to
assay hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs). By October 2010, about 700 GWAS covering 150 diseases

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

and traits have been published and nearly 3000 SNPs have been
reported as signiﬁcantly associated with diseases or traits (Baker,
2010).

Despite of the success of GWAS, most of the ﬁndings only
explain a small portion of genetic contributions to complex diseases.
For example, 18 SNPs identiﬁed from type 2 diabetes (T2D) only
account for 6% of the inherited genetic risk. This phenomenon
is referred to as the missing heritability (Manolio et (11., 2009).
To ﬁnd the missing heritability, some possible methods have been
suggested from biological views (Eichler et (11., 2010; Manolio et (11.,
2009), such as detecting genetic variants with small or moderate
effects, identifying rare genetic variants and structural variants that
contribute to the disease risk and detecting gene—gene interactions
underlying the human diseases (Cordell, 2009). To speed up the
search of genetic variants that underly human diseases, more
powerﬁil computational and statistical tools are needed.

It is typical to test about 500K SNPs simultaneously in GWAS.
For large-scale inference, controlling the false discovery rate (FDR)
turns out to be a powerﬁil strategy (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995;
Efron, 2010). The most commonly used FDR procedure is called
BH procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995), which is based
on thresholding the ranked P-values. It has been observed that
BH procedure is able to control the FDR at nominal level for
case—control studies, but its power decreases as the dependency
among SNPs increases (Sabatti et (11., 2003).

A better FDR control can be achieved in SNP analysis by
exploring the dependency structure (e.g. linkage disequilibrium).
A direct simulation approach (DSA) based on multivariate normal
distribution (MVN) was proposed in Conneely and Boehnke
(2007); Seaman and Muller-Myhsok (2005). Although these studies
primarily focused on datasets used in candidate gene studies, their
work suggested that the block-wise strategy might be a possible
approach for genome-wide studies. By extending the framework of
MVN, a sliding-window approach was further proposed to account
for the dependency among locally intercorrelated markers (Han
et (11., 2009). To be more adaptive to the dependency structure of the
human genome, a hidden Markov Chain Model (HMM), which is a
more ﬂexible structure compared with the block-wise and sliding-
window structures, was proposed to account for the dependence (Wei
et (11., 2009). However, applying these methods to analyze real SNP
datasets in GWAS is very time consuming. Moreover, some methods
report many false positive results in real applications. Thus, ﬁnding
the missing heritability is still a Challenging issue.

CODE

 

In this article, we propose a computational method to detect
disease-associated SNPs with relatively small effects:

(1) The Chance is less than 8% that a causal SNP is directly
genotyped. The effect sizes of their neighborhood SNPs may
become weak due to their imperfect linkage disequilibrium
with the causal one (Spencer et (11., 2011).

(2) Except for a few risk SNPs with relatively large effects,
most of the disease-associated SNPs show small effects
(odds ratio< 1.5) (Altshuler et (11., 2008; Hindorff et (11.,
2009; Manolio, 2010). Due to limited sample size, it is still
statistically Challenging to detect SNPs with small effect sizes
even though they are directly observed.

We assume that the disease-associated SNPs account for only a
small portion of the entire SNP set (i.e. the sparsity assumption).
Therefore, they can be considered as outliers. On one hand, the risk
SNPs with small effects can only be detected as a group due to
the limited sample size. On the other hand, adjacent SNPs tend to
form a local SNP Cluster due to the linkage disequilibrium (LD)
structure of human genome. If there exists a causal SNP which is
not directly observed, the test statistics of its neighboring SNPs
would tend to be different from zero. These facts motivate us to
impose a spatial continuity constraint for outlier detection. Hence,
we formulate the problem as Contiguous Outlier DEteCtion (CODE)
and exactly solve it by graph cuts. As the solution depends on two
parameters for controlling sparsity and spatial continuity, we present
our heuristics for these parameter tuning. We further use stability
selection to reduce the effects of imperfect parameter tuning.

The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section
2, we present our formulation, algorithm and other issues such
as parameter tuning and stability selection. Section 3 discusses
some Closely related methods. Section 4 reports experiment results.
Finally, we conclude our article in Section 5.

2 METHOD

2.1 Problem statement

Suppose we have a dataset with L SNPs in a casewontrol study. The z
value of each SNP can be easily obtained using the Cochran-Armitage trend
test or univariate logistic regression (see the Supplementary Material). Let
z: {zl ,zg...,z£} be a set of z values. For disease-unassociated SNPs, their
z-Values asymptomatically follow the standard normal distribution given a
ﬁnite sample size. For disease-associated SNPs, their z-Values will be more
signiﬁcantly different from zero as the sample size increases (Wang at 611.,
2005). Based on the set of z values, the SNPs can be partitioned into two
groups (Efron, 2008):

0 The null group g0: SNPs are unassociated with the disease.
0 The non-null group g1: SNPs are associated with the disease.
Our goal is to classify L SNPs into these two groups.

Throughout this article, we will use the following norms of a vector x:
||x||0 denotes the Eo-norm, which counts the number of non-zero entries.

x 1: .x,» denotes the El-norm. x 2: Jr; and x 2= x; denote
l l l 2 l l

the Ez-norm and the squared Ez-norm, respectively.

2.2 Formulation

We make the following assumption: most SNPs come from the null group
and the associated SNPs are considered as outliers of the entire SNP set.
Thus, we formulate the above problem as an outlier detection problem using

the mean-shift model (Maronna at 611., 2006):
Z = Y + 6 w (1)

where y = {y1,y2, ...,y£} and 6 = {€1,62, . . .,€£}. This model decomposes z
into two parts: y,6. The non-zero entries of y indicate associated SNPs and
6 ~N (0, 021).

Since most SNPs come from the null group, y will be a sparse vector.
This makes the decomposition in Equation (1) a well-posed problem.
Correspondingly, we propose to solve the following minimization problem:

, 1
mym EIIZ—Y||%+Aill}'||0- (2)

Since we are interested in the associated SNPs, i.e. the non-zero entries of
y, we introduce s=(s1,...,s£),sie{0,1},i=1,...,£ as the support of y:

>_ 0, if y,=0
’_ 1, if 14720.

Suppose SNP A is a causal SNP of the disease, its z value zA will be
signiﬁcantly different from zero. As adjacent SNPs tend to form a local SNP
cluster due to the block-wise structure of the human genome, the z-Values of
its neighboring SNPs also tend to be different from zero, but the magnitudes
of these z values will be smaller than zA due to their imperfect LD with SNP
A. In order to make use of the neighborhood information to increase the
statistical power, it is necessary to introduce a spatial continuity constraint
on 5. To do so, we ﬁrstly rewrite Equation (2) as a minimization problem
over s.

It is easy to see that, as long as )4» 750, we must have )4» =zi to minimize
Equation (2). Thus, Equation (2) has the same minimizer as the following
energy function:

(3)

1
m‘ — .+1 . 4
ym 21,723?) lllyll0 ()

Let 735(z) be the orthogonal projection of z onto the support 5,

. 0,  S) = 0

73s(Z)(l)— { Z1,” if Sizl (5)
and 7351(z) be its complementary projection, i.e. 735(z)+7351(z)=z. The
ﬁrst term in Equation (4) can be written in a compact form as %||P51(z)||%.

Noticing that ||y||0 = ||s||0, we can rewrite Equation (4) as:

, 1
mm—upsuznlémusno.
s 2 (6)
s.t.s,»e{0,1},i=1,...,£.

Notice that X,» = 1 indicates the i-th SNP is detected as an associated one. Now
we introduce a spatial continuity regularizer on s to model the LD effect of
neighboring SNPs. We propose to solve the following optimization problem:

5—]

, 1
msin§||P51(z)||%+M ||s||o+A2 ZWiIsi—sm I. (7)
i2]

s.t. s,»e{0,1},i=1,...,£.

The fused term A2 Ziijlwilsi—siHl encourages the associated SNPs
to be detected in a block-wise manner by penalizing the ﬁrst-order
difference. Our assumption is that the ﬁrst-order model is a reasonably
good approximation of an LD block. This is similar to the ideas of HMM
and the fused Lasso (Tibshirani and Wang, 2008). We allow different
weights between adjacent SNPs to accommodate different local LD effects.
Speciﬁcally, let rig)“ be the correlation of SNP i and SNP 1+ 1. Here we use
r31.“ as W). In fact, r21.“ is the composite LD value of SNP i and SNP 1+ 1,
which is a robust surrogate of the standard LD measure r2 when the linkage
phase is unknown (Schaid, 2004).

2.3 Algorithm

Now we investigate how to minimize the energy in Equation (7) over s.
Noticing that X,» 6 {0,1}, the energy can be rewritten as follows:

5—1

The above energy is in the standard form of the ﬁrst-order Markov random
ﬁelds (MRFs) with binary labels, which can be solved exactly in polynomial
time using graph cuts (Boykov at 611., 2001; Kolmogorov and Zabih, 2004).

Next, we will describe the energy minimization Via graph cuts brieﬂy.
The idea is to represent the energy by a graph and minimize the energy by
ﬁnding the minimum cut of the graph. An example of an undirected graph
g is as shown in Figure 1a. Graph nodes correspond to variables X,» e s, and
two terminal nodes are added indicating binary labels: a O-terminal and a
1-terminal. There are two types of undirected edges in g: the neighboring
link that connects each pair of nodes corresponding to neighboring variables
in s and the terminal link that connects each variable node to two terminal
nodes. In order to construct a graph representing Equation (8), we assign a
weight to each link as follows:

Wynn-+1) (—}vzwi, i=1,...,£—l
€(x,~,0)<—}~1w i=1,...,L , (9)
€(x,,1)<—%z,2. i=1,...,L

where 2mm” is the weight of the link between X,» and s)“, 2mm is the
weight of the link between X,» and the O-terminal and em, 1) is the weight of
the link between X,» and the 1-terminal.

A cut of g is to partition g into two subgraphs by ‘cutting’ some edges
such that two terminals are separated completely. The cost of a cut is deﬁned
as the sum of the weights of the cut edges. Figure 1b shows an example of a
graph cut, in which n, . . . , X,» are connected to the O-terminal and xii.) , . . . , s5
are connected to the 1-terminal after the cut. When the weight is assigned
as Equation (9), the cost of this cut is  em”)+(Z§:§_lemgm)+
2mm +1), which exactly equals to the energy value in Equation (8) for xi =
0,j=1,...,i and sj=1,j=i+1,...,L.

Generally, two facts can be proved (Boykov at 611., 2001; Kolmogorov
and Zabih, 2004): (i) there is a one-to-one mapping between a cut and a
conﬁguration of 5, since any X,» will be connected to either the O-terminal or
the 1-terminal after the cut. (2) For the corresponding cut and conﬁguration
of s, the cut cost equals to the energy value in Equation (8). Note that the
cut cost comes from three sources: if X,» is connected to the O-terminal, em, 1)
will be cut and  is added to the cost. If X,» is connected to the 1-terminal,
2mm will be cut and A] is added to the cost. If neighboring X,» and xii.) are
connected to different terminals, ehm +1) will be cut and MW,» is added to
the cost. The sum of these costs equals the energy in Equation (8). Thus,
the minimizer of Equation (8) 5* can be obtained by ﬁnding the cut with the
minimal cost, which can be solved efﬁciently using the standard max-ﬂow
algorithm (Cormen, 2001).

2.4 Parameter tuning

We need to specify two parameters A] and A2 in our method, where A]
controls the sparsity of s and A2 controls its spatial continuity. Correctly
choosing A 1 and A; can reduce false positive result and also increase
statistical power. When z] , . . . ,zg are independent and identically Gaussian
distributed variables, then zi ~N(0,02),i= 1, . . .,L, a simple choice for A]
is A] =a(/2log(L) which is derived in Donoho and Johnstone (1994). This
choice is due to the fact that the expected maximum of lzi|,i=1,...,L is
approximately a(/2log(L) when zi ~N(0,02), i: 1,...,L.

The above formula assumes that there are L independent SNPs. In reality,
the effective number of SNPs is smaller than L due to the LD effect.
Recently, Han et a1. (2009) used a permutation-based method to estimate
the effective number of SNPs. According to their estimation, the effective
number of the 2.7 million HapMap SNPs is about one million. Thus, We
set A1=a(/2log(L/S), where L/S is the effective number of SNPs with
8 = 2.7. 1

Next, we empirically choose A; in the following way: A; begins with a
large value lam“. Then we solve problem (7) using graph cuts and obtain the
optimal solution of 5. After that, we get the residual r 27351 (z) and compute
the variance of r, denoted as var(r). We gradually decrease A; such that
var(r) gets close to :72. Speciﬁcally, when var(r)> :72, we decrease A; by
a factor r]: A; <— nAz. We repeat this process until var(r)—:72 < 8. The idea
behind this procedure is that the variance of z,»,i ego (z values of the null
group) should be close to :72. In our experiment, we set Am” 2600 (132mm
can be easily chosen as long as most of s are zero. A?” = 600 is satisfactory
in general), 1120.9 and 820.01.

The remaining issue is about the parameter (I. Here we would like to
estimate (I using empirical Bayesian inference as proposed in Efron (2010).
We assume zi ~N(8, 02),Vi 6 go. The choice of 8 =0 and a :1 implies that
the theoretical null distribution is used in statistical inference. However, the
value of a can be quite different in large-scale inference, as pointed out by
Efron (2004). Instead of directly using the theoretical null distribution, Efron
(2004) proposed to estimate the empirical null distribution. Regarding to SNP
data analysis, we employ the locfdr algorithm (Efron, 2010) to estimate 8
and a, and remove the mean of Z: Z) <—zi —8,Vi. In practice, we ﬁnd that the
estimated 8 and a are very close to 0 and 1, respectively. This means that the
empirical null distribution is very close to the theoretical null distribution.
Our observation is consistent with the result in Efron (2010) when the locfdr
algorithm was applied to SNP data analysis.

2.5 Stability selection

Although the heuristic for parameter tuning sounds reasonable, it may
produce too many false positive results. To reduce false positives, we employ
the stability selection strategy (Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2010) to reduce
the effect of parameter tuning. Using stability selection, detection of a
SNP as an associated SNP does not rely on a single run of a particular
parameter setting, but depends on the probability that it is detected under
model perturbation Via subsampling.

Speciﬁcally, for each subsamling round, we randomly sample half of the
cases and half of the controls from the entire dataset. Half subsampling is
very close to the Bootstrap method, which has been theoretically analyzed
in Buhlmann and Yu (2002); Friedman and Hall (2007). Let z; denote the
set of z values for the b-th subsampling. We can efﬁciently obtain z; using
the CochraniArmitage trend test that can be implemented using Boolean
operations (Wan at 611., 2010). After that, we run our model on z; and obtain
the support 5;. Note that b = 1 indicates that the i-th SNP is detected in the
b-th subsampling. Therefore, the probability of the i-th SNP being detected

 

1Notice that the change of 8 only makes A] slightly different, e.g. when
L=30000 and a: 1, we have A124.32,4.29 and 4.22 for 8:27,?) and 4,
respectively. In this sense, the increasing number of reported SNPs and the
correspondingly change of 8 do not make A] too much difference.

where B is the number of subsampling. Typically, we set B: 100 as in
Meinshausen and Buhlmann (2010). We can obtain a set of interesting SNPs
as A, ={i:7'r, Z 1'}, where 1' is a threshold. The number of SNPs in A, is
denoted as |A,|.

2.6 Estimate of FDR

It has been shown that the false positive error can be controlled using this
strategy (Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2010) for the Lasso model (Tibshirani,
1996). However, this theoretical result cannot be directly applied here due
to our different formulation (7). Thus, we need to estimate the FDR of A,
for a given threshold 1'.
Although we do not have independent hypothesis for each SNP, we can

still use N

FDR, I AII (11)
as a rough estimator for FDR (Efron at 611., 2001; Storey and Tibshirani,
2003; Tibshirani and Wang, 2008), where N, is the number of SNPs picked
at threshold 1' under the null distribution. We can use permutation to obtain the
number of SNPs picked under the null distribution. Speciﬁcally, for a given
threshold 1', we do T permutations. During the t-th permutation, we permute
the caseicontrol label to generate a null dataset, denoted as D“). Then, we
run B times subsampling on D“). For each subsampling, we use the heuristic
for parameter tuning and solve problem (6). After B times subsampling, we
obtain 7:“) according to Equation (10). For the given threshold 1', we have

2.7 Analysis of multiple chromosomes

Chromosomes are inherited independently based on Mendel’s Law for
most diseases. In this article, we treat different chromosomes separately.
Suppose there are K chromosomes. Let L}, be the number of SNPs of

k k
Z3) (

the k-th chromosome and z(k)={ 5:} be their z values. We have

21:] L}, = L. There will be no fused terms between different chromosomes.
Accordingly, we solve the following K optimization problems separately:

For parameter tuning, we set A1 2011/log(L/2.7), where (I), is estimated
from the k-th chromosome. We use L rather than L}, for setting A 1 because
we are analyzing multiple chromosomes. The strategy for tuning A2 is the
same as what we described in Section 2.4.

3 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR METHOD AND
OTHER METHODS

Fused Lasso (Tibshirani at 611., 2005) is a closely related method and it has

been used in hot spot detection for CGH data (Tibshirani and Wang, 2008).

To analyze the SNP data using the idea of the fused Lasso, the observed z

values can be decomposed as:

z=u+6. (14)

The fused Lasso (Tibshirani at 611., 2005) could be modiﬁed slightly as
follows:
L L L—I
n11an —m)2+/\1 Emil +12 2 mm,» —sign(ri,i+1)m+1| (15)
1:1 1:1 1:1
where r,,,+1 is the correlation of SNP i and SNP 1+ 1, sign(r,,,+1) is used to
adjust the sign difference between )1, and 11.1.1.1, and w, is the weight for the i-
th fused term. Similarly, 14/, can be used to accommodate the local correlation
structure of adjacent SNPs, e. g. 14/, = r31. + 1. Notice that each element of u is
a real number while each element of s in Equation (7) can only be 0 or 1.
Interestingly, both the ﬁnal solutions of Equation (15) f1 and of Equation (7)
s are piecewise constant. As pointed out by Rinaldo (2009), the ﬁnal solution
of Equation (15) it is a biased estimation due to the shrinkage effect of E1
regularization (Hastie at 611., 2009; Mazumder at 611., 2011).
Since 5 is discrete, our formulation (7) can be rewritten as 60
regularization:

L—I

1
min—IIPuzmémIIsIIo+12 WiISi—SH-llo-
s 2 s  (16>
s.t.s,e{0,1},i=1,...,L.
where
> > _ l, .Yi#.fi+1
Isl *Yl-l-IIO—{O’ Si:si+l- 

It is known that 60 regularization and E 1 regularization have different
mathematical properties (Mazumder at 611., 2011; She, 2009): compared
with E 1 regularization, E1) regularization gives unbiased estimation but larger
variance. The performance of these two formulations depends on the problem
at hand.

The locfdr method (Efron, 2010) extends the original FDR (Benjamini
and Hochberg, 1995) to the local FDR using the two-group model (the
relationship between local FDR and FDR is given in the Supplementary
Material). It assumes that z, with 1‘er comes from the null distribution
f0(z |90) with probability p0 and others come from the alternative distribution
f1 (zl91) with probability 17121—170, where 90,91 are parameters of the
distributions f0 and f1. Under mild assumptions, 170,90, [71,9 1 can be
accurately estimated from data. It turns out that this simple two-group
model works well in practice. The local index of signiﬁcance (LIS) method
(Wei at 611., 2009) can be considered as an extension of the locfdr method.
Speciﬁcally, let I, be the group indicator of the i-th SNP, 11:0 if 1‘er
and I, = 1 otherwise. HMM is used to model the dependence of the adjacent
indicators I, and 11.1.1. It further assumes that z, with 1‘er comes from
the null distribution f0(z|90) and others are from the alternative distribution
f1 (zl91). All the parameters are estimated using expectation maximization
(EM) algorithm. Wei et a1. (2009) has shown that this model is particularly
powerful for identifying non-null SNP clusters. We will compare CODE with
these methods in simulation studies.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Simulation studies

In this section, we compare our method with the 10cfdr method
(Efron, 2004), LIS (Wei et (11., 2009) and the modiﬁed ﬁised
Lasso [Equation (15)]. In order to simulate more realistic linkage
disequilibrium patterns of SNP data, we Choose 3000 individuals
from the WTCCC control dataset (Consortium, 2007) as the pool.
We apply the standard quality control procedure (the proportion
of miss values 3 10%, the minor allele frequency 35% and the
P-value of Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium 3 0.0001) to pre-process
this dataset. We use SNPs from Chromosome 10 for our simulation
studies. We setup two disease causal regions of this Chromosome in

our simulation. This two regions are Chosen by the following criteria:
ﬁrst, within the region, the LD structure is well maintained. Second,
the two regions are distantly separated such that their causal signals
do not interfere with each other. After analyzing the LD pattern of the
WTCCC data, we Choose the 2000-th SNP rs 1575568 and the 5000-
th SNP rs2985526 to be the causal SNPs in our simulation. Then we
generate case—control data using the following logistic regression
model:

X X
Pr(Y=1|X17X2)_ exp(50+51 11—132 2)

——, (18)
1+exp(ﬂo+f31X1+f32X2)

where Y is the case—control label, X1,X2 are the genotype
corresponding to ‘rs1575568’ and ‘rs2985526’, respectively. Here
we have assumed the additive model of the disease risk on the log
scale. In order to simulate small or moderate effects of the causal
SNPs, we set 131 =ﬂg=0.25,0.3,0.4 corresponding to odds ratio
(OR) 1.28, 1.35, 1.49, respectively. For ﬁxed 131,132, we adjust 130
such that the simulated case—control data is balanced. In order to
mimic the situation that the causal SNPs are not directly genotyped,
we remove these two causal SNPs. To avoid the case that the causal
SNPs have been well tagged, we further remove the SNPs which
are almost perfectly correlated with them (r2 3 0.95).

When the causal variant is not included, the deﬁnition of true
and false positives may be problematic. Here all the identiﬁed
SNPs, which are Close to and highly correlated with the causal one
(0.5 f r2 f 0.95), are recognized as true positives, otherwise as false
positives. The performance of these methods are show in Figure 2.
When the signal is moderate (OR: 1.49), all the methods shows
similar performance. As the signal gets weaker and weaker, CODE
is Clearly the winner followed by the 10cfdr method and the modiﬁed
ﬁised Lasso.

It is not surprising that CODE outperforms the 10cfdr method.
On one hand, the spatial continuity constraint enables a SNP with
the weak effect to be detected by borrowing the strength from its
neighbors. On the other hand, this constraint prevents a strong noise
signal from being detected if its neighborhood signals are all weak.

However, it seems surprising that the modiﬁed ﬁised Lasso does
not perform as well as CODE since it also uses neighborhood
information. Our explanation is based on the following facts:

0 The estimation obtained from £1 regularization is biased but
with smaller variance.

0 The estimation obtained from 10 regularization is unbiased but
with larger variance.

For CODE, which uses 10 regularization, the large variance has
been greatly reduced by the stability selection strategy, where
subsampling and aggregation are used like ‘Bagging’ (Breiman,
1996). For the ﬁised Lasso, the improvement of reducing variance
is limited while bias remains.

There is a possibility that we may underestimate the power of
the modiﬁed fused Lasso due to parameter tuning. The heuristics
of parameter tuning is not suitable for the modiﬁed fused Lasso.
Thus, we Choose Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select a
good model for the modiﬁed fused Lasso. Here arises the issue of
the degree of freedom (DF). Recall that the number of non-zero
blocks in the solution [1 is deﬁned as DF of the original ﬁised Lasso
(Tibshirani et (11., 2005). Since a different weight w,- is used for each
fused term in the modiﬁed ﬁised Lasso, the number of non-zero
blocks can only be an approximation of the true DF. This inexact
DF may lead to imperfect model selection with BIC. As we have
used the stability selection strategy, which makes the ﬁnal result
insensitive to parameter tuning, the underestimation of the power of
the modiﬁed fused lasso should be small.

We do not show the result of LIS in the main article, because
we ﬁnd that LIS produces too many false positives (Supplementary
Material). Probably, this is because the EM algorithm gets stuck in
a local optimum when estimating the parameters in HMM.

4.2 Calibration of the threshold of the selection
probability based on empirical studies

We have proposed a procedure to estimate FDR (Benjamini and

Hochberg, 1995) of our method in Section 2.6. For a given threshold

1', T permutations are involved (e.g. T: 100) to estimate FDR,,

Local false discovery rate Threshold T for selection probabilityn

recommend ‘r:0.30 as the default setting as it corresponds to local false
discovery rate 0.2 based on our empirical studies.

which is computationally intensive. A lower threshold 1' may
produce more false positives and a higher threshold 1' corresponds to
less false positives but may miss some true positives. Here we would
like to conduct some empirical studies to connect the threshold 1'
with the local FDR of the locfdr method. In practice, this empirical
calibration may provide a guideline for users to choose a suitable
threshold 1'.

Here we still use the WTCCC control dataset with 3000
individuals. Based on this real data, we run T: 1000 permutations.
Speciﬁcally, at the t-th permutation, we randomly assign the case—
control label for each individual to generate the t-th null dataset
5,, and then we obtain a set of 1 values of 5,, denoted as 3,.
We run the M method on 2, and record the local FDR of 3,,

denoted as locfdr,. We also run our method on the null dataset
5, by B: 100 subsampling, and then we obtain if, (Equation 10).
After all T permutations, we obtain m:{m1,...,my~}
and I? :{i1,...,iT}. After that, we can apply different local FDRs

to locfdr and check how many false positives will be reported. Also,
we can apply different threshold 1' to I? and check the number of
false positives.

Figure 3 provides the calibration result using the SNP data from
chromosome 10. Under the local FDR 0.2, which is the default
setting of the locfdr method, we have observed 442 false positives.
For our method, 441 false positives have been observed when 1':
0.30. The correspondence also holds for some other thresholds, for
example, local false positive rate 0.15 (256 false positives reported
by the locfdr method) roughly corresponds to 1:036 (246 false
positives). We have observed that this relationship is rather stable
when other SNP datasets are used. Thus, we recommend 1' : 0.30 as
the default setting for our method.

4.3 Computational time

Computational efﬁciency is very important in real applications. We
test the running time of our method on a desktop computer. The
results are shown in Table 1.

The locfdr method has a computational advantage compared with
CODE. It can ﬁnish the analysis of 30000 SNPs within 1 s after the
1 values are obtained. For the modiﬁed ﬁised Lasso, we solve 100
combinations of [A1,A2] using the split Bregman method (Ye and
Xie, 2010) for each subsampling. It takes 2148 s for a dataset with
L: 30,000,n=5,000. LIS takes about 563 s to ﬁnish the analysis.

Table 1. Computational time of CODE. The timing is carried out on one
3.0 GHz CPU with 4 GB memory running Windows XP professional system

 

 

Problem size CPU time (s)
L:30000,n:5000 45
L:10000,n:5000 13

 

The reported CPU time is for B: 100 subsamplings. In each subsampling, it involves
calculation of z values and solving multiple times of Equation (7) using graph cuts.

Thus, CODE has computational advantages over the ﬁised Lasso
and LIS.

4.4 Experiments on two independent datasets of
Crohn’s Disease

We apply our method to two independent dataset of Crohn’s Disease
(CD). One CD dataset comes from WTCCC (Consortium, 2007),
in which about 500K SNPs are genotyped in about 5K subjects.
We apply the standard quality control procedure to preprocess this
dataset. The number of remaining SNPs is around 360 000. The
other CD dataset comes from Duerr et (11. (2006), in which 308 332
autosomal SNPs were assayed on the Illumina HumanHap300 chip.
After the same quality control strategy, the number of remaining
SNPs is 291 964. We call this dataset as ‘Duerr’s CD dataset’.

CODE and the locfdr method are applied to these two datasets.
The results are listed in Tables 2 and 3. As we can see, these
SNPs are identiﬁed by both methods and their corresponding genes
are replicable in these two independent datasets. According to
the data base search result from FunctSNP (Goodswen et (11.,
2010), functional SNPs are indicated by ‘*’ in the table. Genes
IL23R, NODZ, ATGI 6L] and ZNF365 have been conﬁrmed to be
Crohn’s disease susceptibility genes (Consortium, 2007; Cummings
et (11., 2007; Duerr et (11., 2006; Haritunians et (11., 2011; Wehkamp
et (11., 2004). Although the analysis result does not provide new
discoveries, it demonstrates that CODE and the locfdr method
are very powerﬁil because these replicable signals have not been
detected in the original analysis (Duerr et (11., 2006). Regarding
to Gene CYLD which is identiﬁed in these two datasets by
both methods, our analysis result suggests that it might be a
CD susceptibility gene although it has not been discussed in the
literature.

Moveover, CODE has identiﬁed some new signals which are
replicable in these two independent datasets. These results are given
in Tables 4 and 5. For Duerr’s CD dataset, the locfdr method
suggests that rs1000141 is associated with CD with local FDR
0.1723. Our method identiﬁes this SNP with selection probability
0.59 and SNP rs3792091 with selection probability 0.47. These two
SNPs locate in gene SAG. For the WTCCC CD dataset, our method
also identiﬁes SNPs (rs2304773-rs2241873) which locate in gene
SAG with selection probability 0.56 while the locfdr method consider
them as insigniﬁcant ones. It is interesting that SNP rs2304773 is a
functional SNP according to the data base search result of FunctSNP
(Goodswen et (11., 2010). Based on this ﬁnding, we conjecture that
Gene SAG is associated with CD. In addition, our method also
identiﬁes some other SNPs which locate genes NKDI and PLD5 in
both datasets. The biological interpretation of these ﬁndings remains
unclear. It would be of great interest if their biological functions
could be investigated.

5 CONCLUSION

In order to detect disease-associated SNP clusters, our formulation
makes use of information among adjacent SNPs. It turns out that
our formulation is an 10 regularization problem and it can be
exactly solved by graph cuts. We have shown that this method is
particularly powerful when the effective size is small or moderate,
which may be of great help in ﬁnding the missing heritability. Using
two independent CD datasets, we demonstrate that CODE is able to
reliably detect weak signals.

CODE begins with 1 values assumed to be normally distributed.
When applying CODE to statistics with other distributions, they
need to be transformed to be normally distributed as what has been
done for the locfdr method (Efron, 2004).

ABSTRACT

Summary: The Ensembl database makes genomic features available
via its Genome Browser. It is also possible to access the underlying
data through a Perl API for advanced querying. We have developed
a full-featured Ruby API to the Ensembl databases, providing the
same functionality as the Perl interface with additional features. A
single Ruby API is used to access different releases of the Ensembl
databases and is also able to query multi-species databases.
Availability and Implementation: Most functionality of the API is
provided using the ActiveRecord pattern. The library depends on
introspection to make it release independent. The API is available
through the Rubygem system and can be installed with the command
gem install ruby—ensembl—api.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Ensembl (Flicek et (11., 2010) and UCSC (Fujita et al., 2010)
genome browsers are the ﬁrst point of call for a large community
of genetics and genomics researchers. Both provide a graphical
interface for browsing the genomes of a large number of species,
displaying the location of genes, polymorphisms, repeats and
regulatory regions. Each database can also be accessed directly
via SQL and provides an interface for simple querying of the data:
BioMart for Ensembl (Haider et (11., 2009) and the Table Browser
for UCSC. In addition, the Ensembl team provides a Perl API for
advanced scripted access to the data (Flicek et (11., 2010).

In recent years, the Python and Ruby scripting languages have
gained signiﬁcant ground in the bioinformatics community (Aerts
and Law, 2009; Cock et al., 2009; Goto et al., 2010, see e.g.),
increasing the need for a programmable interface in these languages.
In this article, we describe a second API to the Ensembl database,
focusing on the Ruby programming community.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The data available in the Ensembl Genome Browser is stored in a set
of MySQL relational databases and to a certain extent normalized.
Every table covers one speciﬁc conceptual Class of objects, such as
‘genes’ or ‘transcripts’. The Ruby ActiveRecord library is used to
map tuples within the Core and Variation tables to objects of a Class,
and delivers a full API with a limited amount of code.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

As does the perl API, the Ruby library provides a Slice Class
which describes a region of the genome. Each Class that deﬁnes
a locus (e.g. gene, simple_feature, assembly_exception) includes
the Sliceable mixin which provides additional methods such as
returning the sequence of the object or its position. The Ruby and
Perl Slice Classes differ however signiﬁcantly at the conceptual
level. The slice for a feature (e.g. a gene) in the perl API is
the complete seq_region this feature is located on, commonly the
whole Chromosome: e.g. ‘Chromosome 13’ for the gene BRCA2. In
contrast, the slice in the Ruby version is delimited by the boundaries
of the feature: ‘ChromosomezGRCh37:1323288961123297334721’
for the same gene. As a result, methods such as overlaps ?,
contains? and within? are available for each object that
implements Sliceable.

The Ruby API to Ensembl is not part of the BioRuby project, but
might be linked to it as a plugin in the future.

3 FEATURES

The user provides the species name (e.g. ‘Homo sapiens’) and an
optional release number to connect to the Ensembl database. It is
not necessary to make the distinction between Core or Variation;
the code will internally open connections to either if necessary. In
addition and in contrast to the Perl API, only a single Ruby interface
is necessary for every Ensembl release. The Ruby API is also able
to work with Ensembl Genomes databases, where multiple species
are stored within the same database (e.g. bacterial, fungal and plant
genomes; Kersey et al., 2010).

The Ruby Ensembl API provides—to our knowledge—the same
functionality as the Perl API where concerning the Core and
Variation databases. Class methods cover searching for records:
every column in the table is available for querying by preceding
it with f ind_by_. These Class methods bypass the need for
Adaptor objects as in the Perl API. Instance methods, on the
other hand, work on records and for example provide access
to speciﬁc data for a single column in a given row (e.g.
my_gene . s tart). As each method call returns an object, different
method calls can be Chained together. To obtain the start position
of the ﬁrst transcript for a gene my_gene, the user can invoke
my_gene . transcripts [O] . start. Functionality that is not
automatically covered by the ActiveRecord pattern but that is present
in the Perl API is also provided. This includes but is not limited to
converting genomic positions between different coordinate systems
(e.g. between Chromosome, scaffold and contig) and SNP effect
prediction. In addition, the user can ask the API what types of
object are related to each other, thus providing additional real-time
documentation for every Class in the API.

Fig. 1. Example script using the Ruby Ensembl API.

The library provides two binaries. The ens embl command
takes a species and release number as argument and drops the
user in an interactive Ruby session for quick querying of the
Ensembl database without the need to write one-off scripts. In
addition, the variation_effect_predictor script takes a
ﬁle containing known or novel SNPs/indels and annotates this list
with a consequence type (e.g. essential_splice_site, stop _gained).

Future efforts will focus on extending the API to the Compara and
FunctionalGenomics databases which provide data for multi-species
comparisons and for ﬁmctional as well as regulatory information.

3.1 Example

Figure 1 shows an example of using the Ruby Ensembl API. Lines
1 to 3 load the library and connect to the Core and Variation
databases for human release 60. In lines 4 and 5, the BRCA2 gene
is retrieved and gene name and location are printed. The #slice
method creates a Slice object, which describes the locus itself and
is serialized into a string. Lines 6 and 7 retrieve all variations within
the gene and report on the total number of variations and the dbSNP
accession of the ﬁrst one. In lines 8 and 9, a locus is deﬁned and
the code checks if the BRCA2 gene is within that locus. Finally, in
lines 10 to 16, a slice of the genome is selected directly. For every
gene in this slice, the gene name in printed as well as the stable ID
and number of exons for each transcript.

4 CONCLUSION

The library described here provides the ﬁmctionality needed to
query the Ensembl database using the Ruby programming language.
This API has several advantages compared to the Perl version,
including a single API for all releases, terser code, a powerful

interactive shell, a more useful implementation of the Slice concept
and extensive introspection. The Ruby Ensembl API is also ideal
for e.g. adding background information on candidate genes from
the Ensembl database in applications geared at clinical geneticists
(e.g. Annotate-It; Sifrim,A. et al., manuscript in preparation).

From a library maintainer’s perspective, the metaprogramming
and introspection capabilities of the Ruby language and the
ActiveRecord module allow for providing full ﬁmctionality and
easy maintenance with minimal effort. They enable the Ruby API
to be very ﬂexible and by deﬁnition virtually insensitive to adding
or removing data columns in tables.

The API is available through the Rubygem system
and can be installed with the command gem install
ruby—ensembl—api. Source code is at http://github.com/
jandot/ruby-ensembl-api. Documentation and an extensive tutorial
(with permission modiﬁed from the Perl API) is also available at
the GitHub website.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recognition models for protein-DNA interactions, which
allow the prediction of specificity for a DNA-binding domain based
only on its sequence or the alteration of specificity through rational
design, have long been a goal of computational biology. There has
been some progress in constructing useful models, especially for
02H2 zinc finger proteins, but it remains a challenging problem with
ample room for improvement. For most families of transcription
factors the best available methods utilize k-nearest neighbor (KNN)
algorithms to make specificity predictions based on the average
of the specificities of the k most similar proteins with defined
specificities. Homeodomain (HD) proteins are the second most
abundant family of transcription factors, after zinc fingers, in most
metazoan genomes, and as a consequence an effective recognition
model for this family would facilitate predictive models of many
transcriptional regulatory networks within these genomes.

Results: Using extensive experimental data, we have tested several
machine learning approaches and find that both support vector
machines and random forests (RFs) can produce recognition models
for HD proteins that are significant improvements over KNN-based
methods. Cross-validation analyses show that the resulting models
are capable of predicting specificities with high accuracy. We
have produced a web-based prediction tool, PreMoTF (Predicted
Motifs for Transcription Factors) (http://stormowustl.edu/PreMoTF),
for predicting position frequency matrices from protein sequence
using a RF-based model.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is a long-standing goal to predict the DNA-binding speciﬁcity
of a transcription factor (TF) based only on its protein sequence
(Benos et (11., 2002a). That ability would allow for the inference of
regulatory networks from genome sequences alone as well as for
the design of TFs with desired recognition sequences. Early hopes
for a simple recognition code (Seeman et (11., 1976) were dashed by
the structures of the ﬁrst few protein-DNA complexes (Matthews,
1988). As the structures of more DNA-protein complexes were
determined it became apparent that there were deﬁnite preferences
for interactions between particular amino acids and base pairs,
and that those preferences might vary depending on the Class of
TF. C2H2 Zinc ﬁnger proteins, in particular, were heavily studied
and a degenerate, qualitative recognition code was shown to be
moderately successful at predicting their binding speciﬁcities (Choo

and Klug, 1994a; Choo and Klug, 1994b; Choo and Klug, 1997;
Wolfe et (11., 1999; Wolfe et (11., 2000). This general idea of Class-
speciﬁc, degenerate recognition codes was further developed into a
quantitative probabilistic code for zinc ﬁnger proteins that was more
predictive than previous models but sill less accurate than desired
(Benos et (11., 2002b; Kaplan et (11., 2005; Liu and Stormo, 2008;
Persikov and Singh, 2011; Persikov et (11., 2009).

The homeodomain (HD) family is the second most abundant TF
family in mammals and most metazoans (Tupler et (11., 2001). The
HD TF family was ﬁrst discovered in Drosophila where mutations
in some HD proteins caused severe ‘homeotic’ phenotypes (Lewis,
1978). Homeodomains typically span ~60 residues that fold into
a stable bundle of three alpha helices (Gehring et (11., 1994). The
C-terminal helix, or recognition helix, binds in the major groove
and an unstructured N-terminal arm binds in the minor groove.
This domain provides a favorable family for construction of a
predictive recognition model because of similarities in docking
geometry for a number of family members (Pabo and Nekludova,
2000; Siggers et (11., 2005) and the Characterization of speciﬁcity
for many members of this family present in the yeast, drosophila
and mouse genomes (Table 1). Using speciﬁcity data for 263 HD
proteins, mostly determined using new high-throughput methods
(Stormo and Zhao, 2010), allowed us to test different machine
learning approaches and to assess the ability of recognition models
to accurately predict the speciﬁcity of HD proteins. Using a cross-
validation methodology we demonstrate that both support vector
machines (SVMs) and random forests (RFs) based methods produce
recognition models that are signiﬁcantly better than previously
published methods.

2 METHODS

2.1 Protein alignment

Table 1 lists the number of HD proteins from each of ﬁve species (including
13 variants of ﬂy HD proteins), the experimental method used to determine
their speciﬁcity and the reference for the datasets. All wild type protein
sequences were obtained from UniPROBE (Newburger and Bulyk. 2009)
or FlyFactorSurvey (Zhu et (11.. 2011). The hmmsearch program from the
HMMER suite (Bateman et (11.. 1999) was used to extract the DBD for every
protein using the homeobox Pfam hmm model (Pfam ID: PF00046) (Finn
et (11., 2010).

Protein binding microarray (PBM) data are available for 168 mouse HD
proteins, but 14 of these (Dbxl. Hoxb5. Hoxb6. Hoxc6, Irx5. th5, th9,
melb, Obox2. Pax6, Phox2a, Six6. Titfl, Tlx2) were removed from the
dataset because their scaled BEEML-PBM PWMS (position weight matrices;
see below) had a total information content (1C) <3 std below the mean 1C
for the entire combined set of motifs.

The HD DBDs were aligned using MAFFT (Katoh et (11., 2005). which
gave higher quality alignments. with fewer gaps. than other programs.
Perhaps the best studied HD protein is the Drosophila engrailed protein
(Fraenkel et (11.. 1998; Kissinger et (11., 1990; Liu et (11.. 1990; Sato et (11..
2004). For consistency with previous studies. HD positions are numbered
with respect to the engrailed HD and all columns in the multiple sequence
alignment that contained insertions relative to engrailed were removed. Only
a small minority of the proteins in the dataset had short insertions relative
to engrailed. The majority of these insertions (26) correspond to the three
residue (TALE) insertion between positions 21 and 22 (Burglin, 1997). Two
other types of insertions only occur in the mouse proteins de, Hmboxl.
ch1 and ch2. Figure 1 displays a sequence logo for the set of aligned HD
proteins used in this study (Crooks et (11.. 2004).

2.2 I-ID motif scaling and alignment

Speciﬁcities for each HD protein were initially represented by PWMS or
position count matrices (PCMs; Stormo et (11.. 1982). For bacterial one-
hybrid (BlH) datasets the PCMs were obtained from the FlyFactorSurvey
database (Zhu et (11., 2011) for ﬂy proteins. The PCMs for human and mutant
ﬂy proteins were obtained from Noyes et a1. (2008). For PBM datasets,
PWMS were generated using the BEEML-PBM program which provides
more accurate PWMS than other analysis methods (Zhao and Stormo, 2011).
Although Alleyne et a1. (2009) were not able to align motifs for HD proteins
based on their analysis of PBM data. the PWMS that we obtained could be
aligned conﬁdently (see below). For purposes of alignment and recognition

 

 

 

 

 

modeling the PWMS were converted to position frequency matrices (PFMs),
where the elements at each position are the probabilities of each base
occurring, using:

3- i,12
Zbe— 1,1;
However. we noticed when comparing the PWMS from orthologous HD
proteins between ﬂies. obtained using the B1H method, and mouse. using the
PBM method, that there was a difference in scaling. A set of close mouse and
ﬂy homologs was assembled for comparison. For each mouse HD protein.
the ﬂy protein that was identical at key recognition residues 5. 47. 50, 51, 54,
55 (Noyes et (11.. 2008) and that was the smallest Hamming distance away
was chosen as the homolog likely to have the most similar motif. Only mouse
and ﬂy HD pairs with a Hamming distance <15 were used. For each of the
104 homologous pairs we determined the optimal scaling factor. The mean
of all of the optimal scalar values for all pairs was 2.238. This scalar value
was then used to scale up all of the BEEML-PBM PWMS before converting
them to PFMS.

Mahoney et (11. developed a multiple PFM alignment program, STAMP,
that produces reliable motif alignments (Mahony 21111.. 2007a; Mahony et (11..
2007b). They further showed a mutual information analysis between the
motif alignments and the protein alignments could be used to determine
some of the key interacting residues for various TF families (Mahony et (11..
2007b). We implemented a similar multiple alignment program in MATLAB
to test additional scoring metrics and methods of guide tree construction.
After developing metrics which incorporated the per column 1C, we found
that the best metric was SSDs (sum of squared differences). also one of the
two best metrics reported by Mahony et (11. We also found that ungapped
local alignments yielded the best PFM alignments and that it was important
to perform motif core alignment. as outlined by Mahoney et (11. when aligning
the relatively short HD motifs to generate a multiple motif alignment (MMA).
Motif cores are deﬁned as consecutive positions in a motif having an IC above
0.3 bits, or if there were not at least four consecutive columns with IC >O.3
bits, then the four consecutive columns with the highest total 1C were used.
If the motif was <4 base pairs long, then the entire motif was designated as
the motif core. The guide tree we used for progressive motif alignments was
based on the Euclidian distances between PFMs, which is simpler than the
p-Value-based alignment trees used by STAMP and produces similar results.

identiﬁed by our feature selection method (positions 3. 6. 19. 47. 50, 54. 55). Most HD proteins contain Asn51 (‘X’ symbol), which is a critical residue in

Fig. 2. Average PFM for the trimmed HD multiple motif alignment

We trimmed ﬂanking positions from the MMA that had a mean IC of <0.05.
The ﬁnal trimmed MMA consisted of nine positions. Figure 2 shows the logo
for the average PFM for the entire HD dataset. The A at position 5 in the
average HD PFM is almost completely conserved. This preference reﬂects
the strong conservation of Asn at position 51, which effectively speciﬁes the
conserved A (Ades and Sauer, 1995; Fig. 1)

2.3 Feature selection for machine learning

Machine learning methods like SVMS and RFs are relatively good at
capturing both the non-linear and linear relationships between independent
variables that give rise to the observed dependent variable. In our case the
independent variables are the amino acids in the DBD of each protein.
The dependent variables are the elements of the PFM for each protein.
27 free parameters for the 9 positions of the HD motifs (Stormo, 2011).
The SVM and RF methods can both perform feature selection as part of
the learning process, but we found that ranking features with an adjusted
form of mutual information (MIp) (Dunn et (11.. 2008) led to faster training
and resulted in more accurate models. To make each PFM matrix discrete.
we used a proﬁle alphabet (Wang and Stormo, 2005). Nineteen different
multinomial probability distributions over the four bases A. C, G and
T were deﬁned and assigned to labels in an alphabet. This allowed us
to convert each column of a PFM to a single discrete label. We began
with an initial set of seed proﬁles chosen to cover the space of possible
PFM columns and then iteratively reﬁned those proﬁles. The Euclidean
distance between every column from every PFM in the MMA and all
19 proﬁle vectors was calculated. Each PFM column was assigned to the
nearest proﬁle. The mean of the set of column vectors assigned to each
proﬁle then became the new proﬁle vector. This process was repeated until
convergence.

MIp was used to rank the positions in the DBDS. The adjustment to the
mutual information proposed by Dunn et a1. (2008) is based on the idea that
the average entropy of each position in an alignment gives each position
a particular propensity toward mutual information. A simple correction to
the MI, called the average product correction (APC). takes into account the
average MI across all of the positions. The ﬁnal corrected mutual information
is MIp(a.b) = MI(a.b) — APC(a.b).

The MIp score was calculated for every possible protein and motif
position pair. Using the maximum MIp score for each position in the protein
alignment. the set of protein positions. or potential features, was then sorted
according to max(MIp) resulting in a sorted set of features. The RF. SVM
and K -nearest neighbor (KNN) methods (described below) were each used
to train a set of models, one model per element of the PFM. WYK encoding
(Stormo, 2011) was used so that only free parameters were predicted by the
models, since each position of a PFM only has three free parameters due
to the constraint that each PFM column sums to one. To avoid imposing an
arbitrary MIp score cutoff to determine the feature set to use for training
the recognition models, the sorted set of features was used to construct
progressively larger feature sets. The ﬁrst feature set contained just the single

DBD position with the highest MIp score. The last feature set in the series
contained all of the residues in the DBD.

2.4 Machine learning algorithms

KNNS is the best published approach for predicting the speciﬁcity of HD
proteins (Alleyne et (11.. 2009; Noyes et (11.. 2008). We included that in our
set of methods so that each approach is trained on exactly the same datasets.
Methods we tested included SVMS. RFs, neural nets (NNs) and partial least
squares regression (PLSR). In pilot studies we found that NN and PLSR did
not perform well compared with RF and SVM and NN was computationally
expensive to run, so comprehensive tests were only performed to compare
the KNN. SVM and RF methods.

2.4.] k-Nearest neighbors The KNNS algorithm is a very simple method
based on the principle that similar inputs generally yield similar outputs. The
Hamming distance between every pair of aligned proteins was calculated.
For every query protein. the closest proteins in the training set served as
the reference proteins. The average of reference proteins” PFMS were then
used as the prediction for the query protein. If the k parameter is set to 1,
only the closest protein is included in the reference set. If it is set to 2. then
the second closest protein is also included. etc. In the case of a tie all of the
corresponding PFMs were averaged together. We used the knnﬂex R package
for the KNN analysis. Surprisingly. in preliminary studies involving the HD
dataset, we found that tuning the k parameter did not increase performance,
so we ﬁxed the k = 1 for all subsequent analysis.

2.4.2 Random forest regression RF is an ensemble method that makes use
of a collection of weak decision trees (Breiman. 2001). There are only two
main user speciﬁed parameters. the total number of trees in the ensemble
(ntree) and the number of randomly selected features to use to determine the
best split at every node in each tree (mtry). so the method is simple to tune.
In practice. it works well even without tuning. although we did tune the mtry
parameter for every RF model. We iteratively tried increasing values of mtry.
from 2 to 50. For all of these iterations. we set ntree to 50 for increased speed.
Next. the mtry versus mean squared error (MSE) curve was smoothed and
the mtry parameter that yielded the best MSE value was determined. Then,
we used the optimal mtry parameter. and we set ntree to 500. which is the
default value. We used the R randomForest package (Liaw and Wiener, 2002)
to generate and make predictions with RFs.

2.4.3 Support vector machine regression SVMS are a popular machine
learning binary classiﬁer that has been adapted to perform regression.
SVMS use a kernel function to map a set of training vectors into a higher
dimensional space. They ﬁnd the linear separating hyperplane that maximizes
the margin of separation in this higher dimensional space. A non-negative
cost parameter. C , is set by the user and determines the weight of the error
term in the minimization (Chang and Lin. 2011). The e1071 R package
was used to train and tune the SVM models. This package is based on the
libsvm program (Chang and Lin. 2011). The dependent variables were each
centered and scaled as recommended. Of the available kernel functions. the
authors of libsvm recommend the radial basis function as the simplest to
tune and the most generally applicable. The radial basis function includes
a gamma parameter. which we tuned along with the cost parameter using
the grid search function implemented in the e1071 package. We searched
over the range 2‘15 5y 523 and 2‘5 5 C523 using a step size of 22. In
preliminary studies involving the HD dataset, we tried using all of the
different kernel functions available in libsvm. However. we found that the
radial basis function performed better than. or as well as, the other kernel
functions and it was much less expensive to tune in most cases.

speciﬁcities (described as PFMs) for a set of 263 HD proteins

Fig. 3. Heat map showing the protein alignment (horizontal axis) versus motif alignment (vertical axis) MIp matrix

(Table 1). MIp analysis of these proteins successfully ranked the
most important key residues with only one false positive in the case
of the HD dataset (Fig. 3, Table 2). Position 19 had a high MIp
score but to our knowledge it has never been observed to make
base-speciﬁc interactions as it is found on the opposite side of the
domain from the DNA-recognition surface (Fraenkel et (11., 1998).
The other top six positions identiﬁed by our MIp-based feature
selection analysis are key residues lmown to interact with the bases
directly in at least one structure (Fraenkel et (11 ., 1998; Passner et (11 .,
1999; Wolberger et (11 ., 1991) or inﬂuence speciﬁcity by substitution
between HDs (Damante et (11 ., 1996). While other groups have used
overlapping, but somewhat different, sets of key residues (Alleyne
et (11., 2009), we ﬁnd that including additional features beyond the
set selected using MIp actually decreased performance for the SVM
and KNN models, and only increased performance slightly for RF
(see below).

Assessments of each method were based on 10—fold cross
validation. The entire set of 263 HD proteins and their motifs
were randomly divided into 10 subsets and in each of 10 training
runs, 9 subsets were used for training the model and the remaining
1 was used to assess the accuracy of the model. Accuracy
was measured as the MSE for each parameter of the predicted
PFM compared with the observed PFM for each protein in the
test set.

Table 2. MIp-ranked features for HD protein and motif alignments

Figure 4 shows the performance for the KNN, SVM and RF
methods as increasing numbers of features (protein positions) are
included. All methods increase in performance (decrease in MSE)
for the ﬁrst seven features, after which they plateau or even increase
MSE. Table 2 lists the positions added as features, the order of which
was determined by the MIp ranking. Those features that improved
the MSE appreciably for all methods are highlighted in yellow. For
the KNN and SVM methods, performance tended to decrease when
eight or more features were employed. The performance of the RF
model did increase slightly in general as more features were added.
Apparently the RF method does a slightly better job of internal
feature selection here than even the SVM method. Based on the
literature (Damante et (11 ., 1996; Ekker et (11., 1994; Kissinger et (11.,
1990; Noyes et (11., 2008), six of these seven residues are thought
to be important residues in sequence speciﬁc DNA recognition in at
least some contexts.

Our previously published KNN-based method, ﬂyhd (Noyes et (11.,
2008), was used to make predictions for all 154 mouse proteins
considered in this study. Flyhd made predictions for 130 of these. A
RF-based model was trained using the same training data employed
by ﬂyhd, which consists of, on average, 22 binding sites selected
by B1H per ﬂy HD protein. The MSE for predicting the mouse
PFMs with ﬂyhd was 0.0159, whereas the MSE for the RF model
was 0.0113, 29% lower. Training an RF model using the latest

The goal of this study was to ﬁnd improved recognition models
for the HD family of TFs. Although they are a very abundant
TF family in nearly all eukaryotic organisms, previous models
have focused on simple nearest neighbor type predictions of

speciﬁcity based on large archives of reference recognition motifs
(Alleyne et (11., 2009; Noyes et (11., 2008). These previous models
have not been informed by the combination of feature selection
derived from mutual information and modeling against reliably
aligned recognition motifs, which could limit their predictive power.
We had previously published a nearest neighbor approach (Noyes
et (11., 2008) for predicting PWMs for new HDs, but we found that
an RF-based model trained with the same ﬂy B 1H Sanger data had
better performance on a mouse test set. Alleyne et (11. (2009) also
used a nearest neighbor approach but they only attempted to predict
8mer enrichment scores for novel HD proteins. They compared
various machine learning methods but found nothing that was better
than nearest neighbors, but their efforts may have been hampered by
an inability to align the motifs they used for training and therefore
having to rely on 8mer enrichments. Our results demonstrate that
with ample high quality and quantitative training data sophisticated
machine learning methods are capable of determining very good
recognition models for HD proteins. We believe that these models
should be broadly applicable to other families of TFs with the caveat
that large deviations in domain docking within subgroups could
complicate family analysis (Pabo and Nekludova, 2000; Siggers
and Honig, 2007). In support of this view, we have preliminary
data demonstrating that this type of approach can provide improved
models for DNA recognition by zinc ﬁnger proteins even though
they have been extensively studied (Benos et (11., 2001; Liu and
Stormo, 2008; Persikov and Singh, 2011).

In the 10-fold cross validation analysis, the average MSE for this
RF model was 0.0085 (Fig. 4). Figure 5 compares the observed
and predicted motif logos for 12 different HD DBDs that are in
the range of the average MSE (0.0080—0.0091) to illustrate the
expected accuracy of the predictions. We have produced a web-
based prediction tool, PreMoTF (Predicted Motifs for Transcription
Factors) (http://stormo.wustl.edu/PreMoTF), for predicting PFMs

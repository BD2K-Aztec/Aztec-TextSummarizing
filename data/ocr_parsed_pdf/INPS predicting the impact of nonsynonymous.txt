Abstract

Motivation: A tool for reliably predicting the impact of variations on protein stability is extremely
important for both protein engineering and for understanding the effects of Mendelian and somatic
mutations in the genome. Next Generation Sequencing studies are constantly increasing the num—
ber of protein sequences. Given the huge disproportion between protein sequences and structures,
there is a need for tools suited to annotate the effect of mutations starting from protein sequence
without relying on the structure. Here, we describe INPS, a novel approach for annotating the effect
of non—synonymous mutations on the protein stability from its sequence. INPS is based on SVM
regression and it is trained to predict the thermodynamic free energy change upon single—point
variations in protein sequences.

Results: We show that INPS performs similarly to the state—of—the—art methods based on protein
structure when tested in cross—validation on a non—redundant dataset. INPS performs very well
also on a newly generated dataset consisting of a number of variations occurring in the tumor
suppressor protein p53. Our results suggest that INPS is a tool suited for computing the effect of
non—synonymous polymorphisms on protein stability when the protein structure is not available.
We also show that INPS predictions are complementary to those of the state—of—the—art, structure—
based method mCSM. When the two methods are combined, the overall prediction on the p53 set
scores significantly higherthan those ofthe single methods.

1 IntrOducuon understanding the effects of human genome variations (Lahti et (11.,

The increasing amount of data generated by the several sequencing
initiatives (Hudson et (11., 2012; Stratton et (11., 2012) calls for accur-
ate and reliable computational approaches to predict the impact of
mutations on the phenotype, and possibly for methods to correlate
them with diseases (Casadio et (11., 2011). More to this, the ability of
accurately predicting the impact of non-synonymous single nucleo-
tide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) on protein stability is essential for

2012). Several methods have been developed so far to predict the ef-
fect of nsSNPs on the protein stability. Some of them require the
knowledge of the protein structure: AUTO-MUTE (M3550 and
Vaisman, 2008), CUPSAT (Parthiban et (11., 2006), Dmutant (Zhou
and Zhou, 2002), FoldX (Guerois et (11., 2002), Eris (Yin et (11.,
2007), PoPMuSiC (Dehouck et (11., 2009), SDM (Topham et (11.,
1997; Worth et (11., 2011), mCSM (Pires et 111., 20143) and NeEMO

(Giollo et al., 2014). Other methods are based only on protein se—
quences (iPTREE—STAB: Huang et al., 2007; MuStab: Teng et al.,
2010) or can use both protein sequences and protein structures
(I—mutant2.0: Capriotti et al., 2005; Imutant3.0 Capriotti et al.,
2008; Mupro: Cheng et al., 2006). Besides the single methods, other
approaches have been tested, such as meta—predictors (iStable: Chen
et al., 2013), filtering approaches based on the available information
about mutations in the same protein site (Wainreb et al., 2011) and
ensemble predictors (Pires et al., 2014b).

The available methods were trained under different conditions
and on different datasets. They address three different questions.
Briefly, they can: (i) predict the AAG real values (in regression) upon
residue substitution, (ii) predict whether a residue substitution pro—
motes a AAG increase or decrease (two class predictors) and (iii) pre—
dict whether a mutation is stabilizing, destabilizing or not affecting
the protein stability (three class predictors). Noticeably, it is also
very difficult to find a good benchmark test set, since all the methods
have to deal with the paucity of the available experimental data.
Almost all methods are trained on data derived from the same
source: the ProTherm database (Kumar et al., 2006 ).

In 2010, Khan and Vihinen made a thorough evaluation of the
different methods considering them as ‘pure classifiers” (i.e. the
methods that predicted the AAG real values were converted into
classifiers). The authors showed that the best performing methods
(I—Mutant3.0—[structure based], Dmutant and FoldX) exploit the
protein structure information (Khan and Vihinen, 2010).

Recently, Pires et al. (2014a) introduced two relevant advance—
ments when evaluating the performance of different methods. They
described: (i) a more correct way to avoid similarity between train—
ing and testing sets when adopting a cross validation procedure and
(ii) a new independent benchmark consisting of a wide range of mu—
tations occurring in the tumor suppressor protein p53, not present
in the original ProTherm database (Kumar et al., 2006). In this art—
icle, we take advantage of these efforts, and we describe INPS (a pre—
dictor of the Impact of Non—syn0nym0us—variations on Protein
Stability), a new method that computes the AAG values of protein
variants without requiring the knowledge of the protein structure.
We show that when evolutionary information is taken into account,
INPS performances are very close to those obtained by the state—of—
the—art methods based on 3D structure, mCSM and Duet. We also
show that INPS predictions are complementary to those obtained
with mCSM (or Duet) and that their combinations, obtained by
averaging the predictions, outperform previously introduced and
combined approaches (Pires et al., 2014b).

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Datasets

In this article, we adopted two previously introduced datasets for
the prediction of protein stability variations upon single point muta—
tions (Pires et al., 2014a): $2648 and P53. S2648 was originally
derived from the ProTherm database (Kumar et al., 2006) and cor—
rected by the authors of the PoPMuSiC algorithm (Dehouck et al.,
2009). The dataset comprises 2648 single—point variations in 132
different globular proteins. In this article, we adopted the two 5 —fold
cross—validation procedure introduced by Pires et al., (2014a) and
the single training/testing set called ‘blind’ by the authors (Pires
et al., 2014a). The first kind of cross—validation fold, labeled as pro—
tein—fold (‘prot’), groups the variations according to their protein
origin (variations belonging to the same protein appear in the same
test set). The second type of cross—validation fold, labeled as pos—
ition—fold (‘pos’), groups variations according to their positions

along the protein sequence (multiple variations of the same protein
position are grouped together in the same test—set). The two different
ways of splitting the same non—redundant S2648 set for a 5—fold
cross—validation procedure are introduced to remove biases due to ei—
ther the presence of the same protein or of the presence of the same
protein position in both training and testing (Pires et al., 2014a). For
sake of comparison, we also report the performances of the methods
using a 5—fold cross validation made by random splitting the muta—
tions in 5 sets (‘random’). The ‘blind’ test set consists of a subset of
351 mutations extracted from the original S2648 dataset, leaving the
complement in the training set, comprising 2297 mutations.

The dataset of P53 variations was also introduced by Pires et al.
(2014a) as a case study, and consists of 42 variations within the
DNA binding domain of the tumor suppressor protein p53, whose
thermodynamic effects have previously been experimentally charac—
terized and collected by several authors (see Pires et al., 2014a and
references therein). When assessing the performances on this data—
set, our method was trained on the subset of 2643 variations ob—
tained by excluding 5 variations of P53 protein from the original
S2648 dataset. This was done to remove the bias due to the presence
of the same chain into the training set.

We also introduce the thermodynamic reversibility of the muta—
tions, i.e. we consider that the inverse variation in a protein (e.g. GA
and AG) is characterized by the negative value of the experimentally
detected AAG (Capriotti et al., 2008). By this, we both recast the
thermodynamic property of the problem (AAG(A,B) : —AAG(B,A))
and balance the distribution of the available experimental measure—
ments of free energy changes (Capriotti et al., 2008).

2.2 The INPS machine learning algorithm

INPS is based on a support vector regression (SVR) as implemented
by the libsvm package (Chang et al., 2011). To reduce the number
of hyper—parameters of the SVR, we tested only the linear and the ra—
dial basis function (RBF) kernels. In both cases, we used all the de—
fault parameters of the SVR, with the exception of C and v. For the
linear kernel, we optimized only the parameter C, which controls
the trade—off between the margin width and the classification error
on the training set. For the REF kernel, both the values of C and y
(y represents the inverse of the width of the REF kernel, roughly
defining the area of influence of a support vector, Chang et al.,
2011) were tuned using a grid search procedure.

2.3 INPS: input encoding

INPS predictor consists of a SVR trained on the S2648 dataset using
seven features of two kinds: (i) six descriptors encode the mutation
type; (ii) one descriptor encodes the evolutionary information. The
variation of residue w with m is encoded with six real numbers:

0 one input for the substitution w—>m (BL62), scored with the
Blosum62 matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992);

0 two inputs for the hydrophobicity of the native (Hyw) and the
mutant (Hym) residues rated with the Kyte—Doolitle scale (Kyte
and Doolittle, 1982);

0 one input to account for the mutability of the native residue
(Mb) scored with the Dayhoff mutability scale (Dayhoff et al.,
1978);

0 two inputs (MWm, MWw) representing the molecular weights
of the native and the mutant residues, respectively.

The evolutionary information is derived by analyzing the mul—
tiple sequence alignments of each query sequence obtained by run—
ning jackhmmer (Eddy, 2011) against the UNIREF90 dataset

/3.IO‘SI€III[10[p.IO}X0‘SDDEIIIJOJIIIOIQ/[Zdllq

(release September, 2014). The parameters were set to: —N 3,
—E 0.001, —d0mE 0.001, —incE 0.001, —incd0mE 0.001. For each
query protein, its multiple sequence alignment was processed to
compute two different scores, derived from a sequence profile and a
HMM model, respectively.

Both scores are separately adopted and tested. Specifically, con—
cerning the ‘profile’ score, the evolutionary information value is
encoded by taking the difference between the wild—type (w) and the
mutant (m) residues at the position of the profile where the mutation
occurs. More formally, if P[k][a] represents the frequency of the resi—
due a at the kth position of the sequence profile, the ‘profile’ score is
computed as P[k][w] — P[k][m].

As an alternative (the so—called ‘HMM’ score), the evolutionary
information was encoded by means of a HMM model obtained by
running the hmmbuild program from the HMMER suite (Eddy,
1998) on the multiple sequence alignment. Both the native and the
mutated sequences are then aligned to the HMM with the
hmmsearch program and the difference of the scores is taken as an
estimation of the variation distance between the two sequences
(HMM).

3 Results

3.1 Computing the change of protein stability upon
residue substitution

For sake of clarity, we first evaluated to which extent each feature
contributes information to the problem of computing changes in AG
values upon residue substitution in the protein sequence (without
using the inverse mutations). In Table 1, we list the Pearson correl—
ation value of the various selected features with respect to the real—
valued AAGs in the S2648 set. All the selected features carry infor—
mation different from random (the P—values associated to the correl—
ation coefficients are significant). When encoding the variation type,
the Blosum62 (BL62) substitution matrix score is the feature with
the lowest correlation value, whereas the Hydrophobic difference
between mutated and wild type residues (AHyzHym—Hyw) ap—
pears the most relevant to infer the AG difference. Among the fea—
tures encoding the evolutionary information, the HMM score is
more informative than the profile score. We trained different SVRs
(see Section 2 for details) and we adopted the more stringent 5—fold

Table 1. Pearson correlation between $2648 DDG values and se-
quence-based features

cross—validation split previously described (Pires et al., 2014a) to
evaluate the method performance as a function of the different input
features. The evaluation considered both the Pearson correlation
and the standard error between the real and the predicted AAG
values.

Table 2 lists the correlation values obtained for each different in—
put feature, after performing an optimization of the parameters on
the training set with a grid search (without using the inverse muta—
tions). In the first line (Mut) we report the correlation of the method
when only the features encoding the variation type are included
(namely, BL62+Hy+Mb+MW). In rows from two to four we
added the features encoding the evolutionary information (Profile
and HMM). When the evolutionary information is included, the
Pearson correlation coefficient values increase by ten percentage
points. The best predictor on the S2648 dataset is obtained with the
inclusion of the HMM score (line three in Table 2). We also eval—
uated the performance of the method (Mut+HMM) by excluding
step by step each of the components of the variation encoding (last
four lines in Table 2). The performance only decreases when
the hydrophobic information is not included in the input (the
Pearson correlation and the standard error fall significantly, line six
in Table 2). This finding corroborates the notion that the hydropho—
bic information is very relevant for the predictions of the AAG
values.

It is also worth mentioning that the performances of the method
(for the different input encodings) are very stable for a wide range of
SVR parameter values. Indeed, when the SVM parameters change,
the Pearson correlation in cross—validation only ranges in the inter—
val 0.50—0.52, with a corresponding standard error of 1.28—1.26
kcal/mol (see Supplementary Materials).

3.2 Inverse variations

From the thermodynamic point of view, an experimentally deter—
mined IAAGI value should hold in a protein for a variant and its re—
verse (Capriotti et al., 2008): a protein and its variant should be
endowed with the same absolute free energy change, irrespective of
the reference protein (native or variant). If this is so, we can assume
that the absolute value of free energy change is the same in going
from one molecule to the other and that what changes is only the
AAG sign. By this, given a free energy value derived experimentally

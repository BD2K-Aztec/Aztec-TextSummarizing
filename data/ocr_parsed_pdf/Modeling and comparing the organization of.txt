ABSTRACT

Motivation: Most prokaryotic genomes are circular with a single
chromosome (called circular genomes), which consist of bacteria and
archaea. Orthologous genes (abbreviated as orthologs) are genes
directly evolved from an ancestor gene, and can be traced through
different species in evolution. Shared orthologs between bacterial
genomes have been used to measure their genome evolution. Here,
organization of circular genomes is analyzed via distributions of
shared orthologs between genomes. However, these distributions are
often asymmetric and bimodal; to date, there is nojoint distribution to
model such data. This motivated us to develop a family of bivariate
distributions with generalized von Mises marginals (BGVM) and its
statistical inference.

Results: A new measure based on circular grade correlation
and the fraction of shared orthologs is proposed for association
between circular genomes, and a visualization tool developed to
depict genome structure similarity. The proposed procedures are
applied to eight pairs of prokaryotes separated from domain down
to species, and 13 mycoplasma bacteria that are mammalian
pathogens belonging to the same genus. We close with remarks
on further applications to many features of genomic organization,
e.g. shared transcription factor binding sites, between any pair of
circular genomes. Thus, the proposed procedures may be applied to
identifying conserved chromosome backbones, among others, for
genome construction in synthetic biology.

1 INTRODUCTION

Most of the prokaryotic genomes (1158 out of 1194, NCBI, August
2010) are circular with a single Chromosome (called circular
genomes henceforth). Orthologous genes (abbreviated as orthologs)

are genes directly evolved from an ancestor gene (Tatusov et al.,
1997), and can be traced through different species in evolution.
The fraction of shared orthologs between two circular genomes was
found to be better conserved than the order of genes (Huynen and
Bork, 1998), in which the fraction of shared orthologs between
genomes was employed to measure genome evolution of nine
prokaryotes. Here, our emphasis is on the structure of circular
genomes, which, for example, plays an important role in synthetic
biology. A review paper in synthetic genomics (Carrera et al., 2009)
indicates that genome organization may inﬂuence gene expression,
which is vital for organisms. Further, predicting or modeling
the rules of genome organization via comparative genomics may
provide valuable information for genome construction.

We reason that genome structure can be studied via distributions
of shared orthologs between genomes, e. g. the most or least favored
region in which shared orthologs between each pair of bacterial
genomes are located. While the marginal distributions of shared
orthologs are often found to be asymmetric and bimodal, to date
there is no joint distribution with Closed-formed marginals to model
such data. This motivated us to develop a family of j oint distribution
and its related statistical inferences.

Recent studies show that gene order is extensively conserved
between Closely related species, but rapidly become less conserved
among more distantly related species. This trend is likely to be
universal in prokaryotes (Tamames, 2001; Wolf et al., 2001).
However, the fraction of shared orthologs between two circular
genomes is more conserved than the order of genes (see Fig. 6
of Huynen and Bork, 1998). In addition to the fraction of shared
orthologs between bacterial genomes, we further incorporate the
distributions of shared orthologs of paired circular genomes to infer
similarity of their genome organization. By converting the locations
of shared orthologs in any paired circular genomes into angles, these
pairs of angles can be viewed as bivariate circular vectors.

Most of the marginal distributions of shared orthologs in circular
genomes are asymmetric and/or multimodal, which can be modeled
by the generalized von Mises distribution (GVM) (Maksimov, 1967;
Yfantis and Borgman, 1982). Therefore, we propose a family of
bivariate circular distributions with each marginal assuming a GVM
distribution, and call this family the bivariate generalized von-Mises
(BGVM). The inference procedures, estimation of the parameters
in BGVM and testing for independence of structures of paired
circular genomes, are developed. A novel correlation measure, which
is based on the fraction of shared orthologs and a circular grade
correlation derived here, is introduced to measure organization

Modeling and comparing circular genomes

 

similarity between circular genomes. Furthermore, this similarity
is visually depicted by the rose diagrams of shared orthologs.

The marginal distributions of BGVM are quite ﬂexible since
GVM can model either symmetric or asymmetric, unimodal or
multimodal circular data, depending on the values of its four
parameters. The probability density function (pdf) of GVM is in
closed form and thus is convenient for inferences; see Yfantis and
Borgman (1982) for details.

In the following, we brieﬂy review literature on modeling
bivariate circular data, e.g. shared orthologs of paired prokaryotic
genomes. Thompson (1975) mentioned the wrapped bivariate
normal distribution. Mardia (1975) proposed a generalized von
Mises—Fisher model for paired angles (61,62). Wehrly and Johnson
(1980) generated families of bivariate circular distributions with
jpdf:

f(91792)=277g{277[F1(91)—F2(92)]}f1(91)f2(92)7 (1)

where 0 3 61,62 < 271, g, f1 and f; are densities on the Circle, and F1
and F2 are the distribution functions of f1 and f2, respectively. The
pdf in Equation (1) has f1 and f2 as its speciﬁed marginals. Shieh and
Johnson (2005) studied a family of bivariate distributions, belonging
to these families in Equation (1), with von Mises marginals and
its inferences. Rivest (1988) investigated inferences for a bivariate
generalization of the Fisher—von Mises distribution. Unfortunately,
the marginals of these distributions are symmetric and unimodal,
hence they cannot be employed to model distributions of shared
orthologs in paired circular genomes. Bivariate circular distributions
with asymmetric and/or multimodal but Closed-formed marginals
have not been well explored, thus we study them here.

2 METHODS

Here, we investigate inference procedures under BGVM which has the
probability density function:

1 , ,
f12(91’92)=2”f1(91)fz(92) X — elmL05(27T[F1(91)-F2(92)l-M12)’ (2)
271100612)
where 0 591,62 < 2 7!, [(12 Z 0, 05 p.12 <2J'r and Io(-) denotes the modiﬁed
Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind and order zero. These GVM marginals
assume the forms

ﬁ(9j)=q—lercos(6f—uf)+).fcos[2(0f—vf)] forjz 127
where Cf] =271{10(Kj)10(}vj)+22::l In(Aj)12n(Kj)-cos[2n(uj — vj)]}. These
p]- and vi (Kj and A!) are location (dispersion) parameters, and we denote
this GVM distribution as GVM (pf, Vj,Kj,Aj) henceforth. The joint density
BGVM involves the cumulative distributions F j(90)= fog 0 ﬁ(6)d6, but with
todays computing power this is not a serious drawback. We note that this
class of bivariate circular distributions can include other marginals, e.g.
t-distribution (Shimizu and Iida, 2002), von Mises distribution (Shieh and
Johnson, 2005) and Jones and Pewsey’s distribution (Jones and Pewsey,
2005).

2.1 Roles of some parameters in the BGVM model

The parameters K and A in a GVM (u, v,K,A) marginal control not only the
concentration at 62p, and 6:12 but also the graphic shape of the density.
If K20, the GVM is antipodally symmetric and has two modes, depending
on A, at 6:12 and 6:v:l:rr. If A20, the GVM reduces to the von Mises
distribution, which is symmetric and unimodal, with mean direction )1. and
concentration K; the larger K is the more concentrated when the distribution
is at u. If [142:0 , the BGVM is a unimodal distribution, and as [(12
increases the association between 81 and @2 increases, which indicates

that the association between the given pair of circular genomes increases.
From the copula representation in Section 2 of Shieh at al. (2006), we have
that <I>1=2JIF1(®1) given 92 is VM (M12+271F2(92),K12). When M12=0,
<I>1 centers on 271F2(92), and the dependence of 81 on 82 is controlled by
the magnitude of K12.

A BGVM generator written in R is available at http//:www.stat.sinica.edu
.tw/~gshieh/bgvm.htm.

2.2 Estimation and testing hypothesis under a BGVM
distribution

2.2.1 MLEs of the parameters Assuming that shared orthologs between a
pair of circular genomes follow a BGVM distribution, given their converted
angles we can immediately obtain the ﬁtted BGVM distribution by applying
the MLE algorithm in MLE_LR-testR of the Supplementary Material. The
MLE algorithm was modiﬁed from the NewtoniRaphson method (Tanner,
1996), to prevent the estimates for the model in Equation (2) being trapped
in local maxima, which was caused by the sinusoidal functions in the joint
density. Next, we derive the limiting distribution of MLEs for the parameters
in BGVM. The likelihood ratio test for independence of the organization
between genomes is addressed at the end of this section.

To see how the MLE algorithm performs, we show its estimation results
using data generated from BGVM with the parameters (M1,v1,K1,A1,M2,
V2,K2,A2,M12,K12)=(%,  1, ,  1, 1, 1,2) and the sample size 100. We
ﬁrst estimated parameters of the marginals and obtained (01,131,121 1):
(1.40, 1.52,0.99,0.86)and(;12,132,122,12)=(1.46, 1.56, 109,094). Next, we
used these estimates as initial values and applied the MLE algorithm
to estimate parameters of the joint density. The estimates obtained are
(mjlﬁhihnmz, 122124112112) =(1.33,1.65, 0.92, 0.95. 1.62, 1.55.
1.02, 0.90, 0.92, 2.32), which are quite close to the true values.

After the MLEs been computed, estimates of their variances and
covariances can be obtained from derivatives of the likelihood or by
numerical integration of the squares and products of the partial derivatives
given in Section 3 of Shieh at al. (2006). Let n =(M1,V1,K1,A1,M2,V2,K2,A2,
M12,K12)T be the vector of 10 unknown parameters. The parameter space is
then

Q={05p.,»<27r, ngi<oo,05vi<2m
OSAi<OO,OSM12<271,OSK12 <00 },

for i=1,2. Let 1,,(27) denote the log-likelihood function, and Un(r]) and
—I,,(r]) the ﬁrst and the second derivatives of 1,,(27), respectively.

When the vector of parameters n belongs to the interior of the parameter
set, the regularity conditions (see Section 3 of Shieh at al., 2006 for
details) hold, and the consistency of the MLEs follows, which implies that
the vector of MLEs multiplied by ﬂ converges to their true parameters.
Asymptotic multivariate normality of the MLEs then follows from Lemma 1
and Theorem 2 of Self and Liang (1987), which indicates that this centered
vector converges to a multivariate normal distribution as stated below.

THEOREM 1. Let n belong to the interior of the parameter set. The vector of
MLEs n has multivariate normal limiting distribution, and

Jail—27) converges in distribution to N10(0,I_l ),

1ik(TI)=E|: —111f12(@1.@2|71) —111f12(@1.®2|37 ) 
377i 317k

The 10 partial derivatives are straightforward and are omitted.

REMARK If some of the parameters are known, then asymptotic normality
holds for the reduced set with the corresponding entries in the information
matrix.

Numerical integration can be used to obtain each of the entries Iik’s.
However, this could be difﬁcult and it is better to use the estimated, or

apply if we include [(12 :0 in the parameter space. If K) and A), i: 1,2 are

(1987), Theorem 2 and Case 2 of page 606, ﬁt?” has limiting distribution

from I“. The cases where K1 :0, A120, [(220 and/or A220 are treated
similarly.

2.2.2 Testing for independence of the organization between circular
genomes To test the hypothesis that the organization of paired prokaryotic
genomes are independent or not, e.g. whether the structure organization of
Thermotoga and that of Sulfolobus are independent, we consider likelihood
ratio tests (LR tests), which include two cases. In both cases, under the
BGVM joint distribution this test is equivalent to testing

H01K12=0 versus H1 ZK12 > 0.
The likelihood ratio statistic is —2ln}t,,, where

There are really two cases, and the second case is the most complicated.

are close to zero. The limiting distribution of —2lnA,, is

2.3 A novel circular correlation measure r1,7g

Huynen and Bork (1998) used the fraction of shared orthologs between
genomes to study genome evolution. The ratio of shared orthologs between a
pair of genomes to the maximum possible number of shared orthologs, which
is estimated by the size of the smaller genome in each pair of genomes, is a
reasonable index for association of organization between circular genomes.
This ratio (denoted by r,,) can be written as

The number of shared orthologs between genomes

 

rp _ The size of the smaller genome in each pair of genomes-

To characterize association between a pair of circular genomes more ﬁnely,
the similarity of their distributions of shared orthologs should be taken into
account. This association can be measured by a circular grade correlation
(rg) derived in the next subsection. Weighting both rp and rg equally gives
rise to a novel circular correlation measure

1
r1Jg=§(r]J+rg)-

Note that there is a parameter, namely protein sequence similarity, involved
when choosing one-to-one orthologs between genomes. The rule of thumb
is to choose a protein sequence similarity value such that rp and rg are of
the same scale, e.g. 0.7 was suggested for the threshold of protein sequence
similarity in a pilot study, in which the BGVM procedures were applied to
the nine prokaryotic genomes in Application 1.

2.3.1 A circular grade correlation measure rg When the joint pdf of two
r.V.’s on the real line, say X1 and X2, involves the marginal cumulative
distributions F i(Xi),i = 1,2, the grade correlation (pH) (Hoeffding, 1948)
was shown to be suitable for correlation of X1 and X2. This correlation
measure is deﬁned as

C0V(F1(X1).F2(X2))

\/ V8I(F 1 (X 1 ))V8I(F 20(2)) I

Recall that (81k , 8%), k = 1, . . . ,n, denote the mapped angles ofn pairs of
shared orthologs between prokaryotic Genomes 1 and 2. When the joint pdf of
these pairs of angles involves the marginal cumulative distributions F ,(Qi), i =
1,2, a suitable correlation may be modiﬁed from the grade correlation pH.
Similar to previous works on deriving association measures for bivariate
circular data (Shieh et al., 1994; Shieh and Johnson, 2005), a new circular
grade correlation coefﬁcient for bivariate circular data, that allows for
different choices of the origins in each genome, is

pg 2 max Corr(F1(®1),F2(mod(®2+8)))

where F,»(®,») is uniformly distributed on [0, 1], for i=1,2, and mod(®2 +8)
denotes ®2+8 (mod 271). Via some computation in Appendix1.pdf of the
Supplementary Material, we obtained that the circular grade correlation

Modeling and comparing circular genomes

 

2.3.2 The large sample (limiting) distribution of rg For each pair of
genomes, the number of shared orthologs can range from a few hundred
to more than two thousand. With such large sample sizes, the limiting
distribution of the circular grade correlation estimate rg in general follows
a normal distribution. To provide conﬁdence intervals for pg to judge
whether the similarity on distributions of shared orthologs of paired circular
genomes is different from zero (independence) or not, we derive the limiting
distribution of the centered rg.

Because rg is the MLE of pg, the large sample distribution of rg follows
a normal distribution with its covariance matrix computed from angles of
shared orthologs. That is,

d
rg — pg ~N(O,D2),

where the covariance matrix D2 can be computed by our code,

D = 3h<K1K21Jt12> I (91 ~92) wilful» ~

Bun 3M12

 and  are derived in Appendix2.pdf of the Supplementary
Material, which provides a proof for the convergence of the centered rg to a
normal distribution.
The 1 — oz conﬁdence interval of pg(61 ,92) is [rg — Za/QD, rg +Za/2D], where
0<Ol<l and Za/z is the critical value of the standard normal distribution
N(0, 1) at the level of 01/2.

2.3.3 A visualization tool: rose diagrams To Visually depict association
between paired circular genomes, we applied rose diagrams (a kind of angular
histogram; Fisher, 1993) to each pair of shared orthologs. The radius of each
sector with a binwidth of 10° or other angles is proportional to the relative
frequency of shared orthologs, whose corresponding angles belong to the
sector, e.g. 60° ~70° of the rose diagram of Sulfolobus in Figure 1, where
the inner dotted (outer) circle denotes the frequency being 10 (20). In general,
a small binwidth results in a bumpier rose diagram than that of a large one.

3 RESULTS

In this section, we apply the proposed procedures to shared orthologs
between paired prokaryotic genomes to measure similarity of their
genome organization. However, we note that our procedures can
be applied to many features of genomic organization, e.g. shared
TFBSs, shared repeated elements (Benson and Waterman, 1994) and
shared non-coding genes (e.g. rRNA and small RNA), by inputting
their corresponding angles instead of those of shared orthologs to our
algorithm. For instance, both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis
have more veriﬁed TFBSs than other bacteria, and we can analyze
their shared TFBSs using procedures developed here.

3.1 Data preprocessing

To let the shared orthologs between paired circular genomes reﬂect
their similarity, we ﬁltered out predicted horizontal transferred
genes. The ﬁltering was performed using data from the Horizontal
Gene Transfer Database (Garcia-Vallve et al., 2003), which were
accessed at http://genomes.urv.es/HGT—DB/. After the ﬁltering, only
species-speciﬁc genes were left in each circular genome, and we
mapped their physical positions into angles ranged in [0271). As an
ortholog in each circular genome has a Clustered orthologous group
(COG) ID (Tatusov et al., 1997), the genes having the same COG
ID in any paired circular genomes were identiﬁed as orthologs.
Paralogous genes (abbreviated as paralogs) are genes related by
duplication within a genome. Due to gene duplication, there may
be orthologous sets of paralogs within one genome, and several

paralogs may share the same COG ID. That is, there are one-to-many,
many-to-one and many-to-many corresponding shared orthologs
besides the one-to-one corresponding ones. Using the following
minimum angle distance, we can identify one-to-one shared
orthologs. Let D(A, B) denote the distance between orthologs A and
B, and D(A,B)=min{|angle of A—angle of B|,27'r— |angle of A—
angle of B|}. For an orthologous set (multiple paralogs with the
same COG ID), we use the shortest distance ortholog pairs
(A,B), where Dmin(A,B)=minl-st(Al-,Bj) and lfifm, lfjf
n, provided that m and n are orthologs in genomes A and B
corresponding to one COG ID.

Let 6,; and Bkj for 1 f j 3n, denote the corresponding angle of
the ﬁrst base of the shared ortholog j in genomes i and k, which
were used for statistical inferences. Note that within any given pair
of genomes, the locations of distinct ortholog pairs are assumed to
be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. Because
marginals of shared ortholog genomes were often found to be
asymmetric and bimodal, we ﬁtted a BGVM model to each pair
of shared orthologs for the prokaryotic genomes studied.

In the following, we apply the proposed BGVM procedures and
rose diagrams to two sets of prokaryotic genomes, consisting of
eight pairs of prokaryotic genomes separated from domain down

3.2 Application 1: eight pairs of prokaryotic genomes
separated from domain to genus

In this application, we compare the structure organizations
for each of the following pairs of bacterial genomes, which
are (Thermotoga, Sulfolobus), (Clostridium, Thermotoga),
(Lactobacillus, Clostridium), (Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus),
(Oceanobacillus, Staphylococcus), (Bacillus, Oceanobacillus),
(Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus subtitlis) and (Bacillus anthracis
Ames, Bacillus anthracis Sterne). These pairs of genomes belong
to different domains, the same domain, phylum class, order, family,
genus and the same species, respectively. Among them, we ﬁrst
tested whether the genome structures of each pair are independent
or not. After using the threshold of 0.7 for protein similarity
to identify shared orthologs between each pair of genomes, we
plotted their rose diagrams, which showed that several of the
marginals are bimodal. Due to a space limit, only the rose diagrams
(using a binwidth of 10°) of the ﬁrst three pairs are presented
in Figure 1; see Supplementary Figure S1 in Application1.pdf
for all rose diagrams. Some marginal distributions of these pairs
of bacterial genomes were asymmetric, based on the result of
the test for symmetry in Pewsey (2002). For instance, some
marginals of (Thermotoga, Sulfolobus), (Clostridium, Thermotoga)
and (Lactobacillus, Clostridium) are asymmetric at the 95%
signiﬁcance level; see Table 1 for details.

For asymmetric and bimodal marginals of shared orthologs,
it was reasonable to ﬁt GVM distributions. Goodness-of—ﬁt was
checked by QQ-plots, similar to those in Shieh et al. (2006), which
indicated that the ﬁts were adequate for the marginals. For the ﬁtted
GVMs and QQ-plots, please see the ﬁle at http://www.stat.sinica
.edu.tw/~gshieh/bgvm.htm. The asymmetry and bimodality of the
marginals suggested ﬁtting a BGVM to shared orthologs for each
pair of prokaryotic genomes. The MLE estimates of parameters
in BGVM of (Thermotoga, Sulfolobus), (Clostridium, Thermotoga)
and (Lactobacillus, Clostridium) are given in Table 2.

Employing the LR-test based on the distributions of shared
orthologs, we test whether genome organization of each pair of
these prokaryotes are independent. (Not) rejecting this hypothesis
indicates that their genome organizations are (not) correlated. For
each pair of prokaryotic genomes, a LR-test of shared orthologs
was computed, and the result showed that except (Thermotoga,
Sulfolobus), the hypothesis was rejected for the other seven pairs at a
95% level using Case 2; see Applicationl .pdf of the Supplementary
Material for details. This result indicates that for these seven pairs,
their genome organizations are correlated based on the similarity

of the distributions of their shared orthologs. This association can
also be seen easily from their rose diagrams, in particular those of
Bacillus anthracis Ames and Bacillus anthracis Sterne.

Next, we estimated the association of genome organizations of
each of the eight pairs of prokaryotes. Note that the origins of
most prokaryotic genomes are unknown (and having no rules to
predict) or predicted, which demonstrates the importance of rpg’s
being invariant to the origins of both circular genomes. The values
of rp, rg and rpg of these pairs (in Table 3) are incidentally consistent
with their phylogeny relationships. The rose diagrams show that
the genome structures of Bacillus anthracis Ames and Bacillus
anthracis Sterne are almost identical, while those of Thermotoga
and Sulfolobus are not at all alike.

3.3 Application 2: 13 mycoplasma bacteria

Above we showed that the BGVM distribution and its inference
procedures can be applied to distinguish genome organization
of eight pairs of bacteria in Application 1, in which genomes
of six pairs were relatively distant (from different genus or
beyond). Here, we apply the proposed procedures to a set of
13 mycoplasma bacteria, which are relatively close in phylogeny,
to see if rpg can distinguish their genome organization. These
bacteria are mammalian pathogens with small genomes, which
belong to the same genus. Speciﬁcally, their phylogeny tree based
on 16S ribosomal sequence, constructed by the software MEGA4,
is in Application2.pdf of the Supplementary Material. Among these
bacterial genomes, three origins are unknown and nine are predicted,
which demonstrates the need of a correlation measure invariant to
the origin of a circular genome such as rpg.

Due to space limit, we use genome numbers 1713 to represent the following 13
bacterial genomes, respectively: M. genitalium G37, M. mobile 163K, M.synoviae 53,
M.pneumoniae M129, M.agalactiae PGZ, M.hyopneumoniae 232, M.hyopneumoniae J,
M.hyopneumoniae 7448, M.pulmonis UAB CTIP, M.gallisepticum R, M.capricolum
subsp. capricolum ATCC 27343, M.mycoides subsp. mycoides SC str. P61, and
M.penetrans HF-2. Further, No. denotes genome numbers.

The pairwise rose diagrams (with a binwidth of 10°) of
these 13 bacterial genomes showed that several of the marginals
were bimodal and asymmetric; see http://www.stat.sinica.edu
.tw/~gshieh/bgvm.htm for details. Hence, we ﬁtted a BGVM
distribution to the shared orthologs for each pair of bacterial
genomes. Next, the correlation measure rpg was applied to these
genomes to result in the values in Table 4.

Interestingly, these associations are consistent with those
measured based on similarity of their 16S rRNAs. Among
these 13 bacterial genomes, the top few correlated pairs in
terms of rpg are (M.genitalium G37, M.pneumoniae M129),
(M. hyopneumoniae J, M. hyopneumoniae 7448), (M. hyopneumoniae
232, M.hyopneumoniae 7448) and (M.hyopneumoniae 232,
M.hyopneumoniae J), whose values are equal to 0.77, 0.71, 0.69
and 0.67, respectively. The latter three pairs are hyopneumoniae,
which cause chronic disease in pigs and attach to the same organ
(lung cilia). From the rose diagrams of these hyopneumoniae in
Figure 2, we can see that their genome structures are quite similar
in terms of shared orthologs. The most favored regions of their
shared orthologs are 80°—90°, (20°—30° and 330°—340°) and
(20°—30° and 330°—340°), respectively, in which 23, (16 and
17) and (14 and 16) genes are in common, respectively. Among
these genes, the largest common functional group is translation,
and their gene orders are also conserved. For details, please see
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 in Application2.pdf. In particular,
the rose diagrams of (M. hyopneumoniae J, M. hyopneumoniae 7448)
clearly depict their similarity in genome organization, and the most
and least favored regions of shared orthologs are 80°—90° and
150° — 160°, respectively. The genes located in the most favored
region, encode ribosomal subunit proteins 30S and 50S, which are
essential genes and are known to cluster together to form an operon
structure in many bacterial genomes (Bratlie et al., 2010).

Moreover, the aforementioned relationships depicted by rose
diagrams are consistent with those of the other analysis on genome
organization (Application2.pdf of the Supplementary Material).
Thus, our procedures may provide useful information on comparing
the organization of circular genomes and genome construction in
synthetic biology.

4 DISCUSSION

The proposed BGVM distribution, with ﬂexible and closed-formed
marginal distributions, was shown to model paired angular data
well, in which each marginal of the pair can be asymmetric
or/and multimodal, e.g. shared orthologs between paired bacterial
genomes. Statistical inferences employing the MLEs for parameters
of the BGVM distribution and the LR-test for independence of
the organization between circular genomes are established. A
novel circular correlation measure (rpg), invariant to the choices
of origins of circular genomes which are mainly unknown or
predicted, was derived and a visualization tool provided. We
applied these procedures to two sets of prokaryotic genomes,
consisting a set of relatively distant prokaryotes and a set of closely
related bacteria. The novel correlation measure rpg was shown to

summarize associations between prokaryotic genomes well. While
the rose diagrams further depict their associations via distributions
of the shared orthologs. Our results are consistent with those of
other analysis. Thus, the BGVM procedures may provide useﬁil
information on the organization of circular genomes.

We note that the BGVM procedures can be applied to identify
shared TFBSs, shared coding or non-coding genes and shared
repeated elements between circular genomes. Thus, they may be
applied to identifying conserved chromosome backbones, detecting
conserved gene clusters such as operons, among others, which can
be used for genome construction in synthetic biology.

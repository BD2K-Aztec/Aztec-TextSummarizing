ABSTRACT

Motivation: Often during the analysis of biological data, it is of import-
ance to interpret the correlation structure that exists between vari-
ables. Such correlations may reveal patterns of co-regulation that
are indicative of biochemical pathways or common mechanisms of
response to a related set of treatments. However, analyses of correl-
ations are usually conducted by either subjective interpretation of the
univariate covariance matrix or by applying multivariate modeling tech-
niques, which do not take prior biological knowledge into account.
Over-representation analysis (ORA) is a simple method for objectively
deciding whether a set of variables of known or suspected biological
relevance, such as a gene set or pathway, is more prevalent in a set of
variables of interest than we expect by chance. However, ORA is
usually applied to a set of variables differentiating a single experimen-
tal variable and does not take into account correlations.

Results: Over-representation of correlation analysis (ORCA) is a novel
combination of ORA and correlation analysis that provides a means to
test whether more associations exist between two specific groups of
variables than expected by chance. The method is exemplified by
application to drug sensitivity and microRNA expression data from a
panel of cancer cell lines (NCI60). ORCA highlighted a previously
reported correlation between sensitivity to alkylating anticancer
agents and topoisomerase inhibitors. We also used this approach to
validate microRNA clusters predicted by mRNA correlations. These
obsen/ations suggest that ORCA has the potential to reveal novel
insights from these data, which are not readily apparent using
classical ORA.

able at https://github.com/ORCABioinfo/ORCAcode

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput biological techniques such as gene expression
microarray or high-throughput sequencing have become a rou-
tine for most research laboratories in life sciences. Thousands of
biomolecules in different conditions, e. g. mRNAs, microRNAs,
proteins or metabolites, can be measured simultaneously.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In complex diseases, such as cancer, these biomolecules in a
group (such as a pathway or a gene set) are often altered to-
gether. Two conventional, but contrasting, approaches for ana-
lyzing coordinated responses in molecular profile data are
correlation analysis and pathway analysis. In correlation or co-
variance analysis (and its multivariate extensions such as princi-
pal components analysis and canonical correlation analysis),
there is a focus on quantitatively estimating the explanatory
power of one variable over another to infer some fundamental
link between the observed biomolecules. In pathway analysis,
however, the objective is to use prior knowledge about interact-
ing or otherwise related sets of biomolecules and to test speciﬁc
hypotheses about the relationship between a particular set of
those biomolecules (the ‘pathway’) and a given experimental con-
dition. A conventional approach for pathway analysis of high-
throughput biological data is over-representation analysis
(ORA). To perform ORA, ﬁrstly, the biomolecules, such as
mRNA, proteins or microRNA, considered ‘differentially ex-
pressed’ in two or more conditions are identiﬁed. Secondly, the
number of differentially expressed biomolecules in each pathway
is determined. Finally, for each pathway, a probability value (P-
value) of obtaining the number of differentially expressed bio-
molecules against the background list of all biomolecules mea-
sured is calculated using a hypergeometric distribution. The ﬁrst
implementation of ORA was by Tavazoie et a]. (1999) where
transcriptional regulatory subnetworks in yeast were identiﬁed
by using mRNA microarray profiling. Most implementations of
ORA are used to perform pathway analysis based on pathway
information, such as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) or other pathway databases (Cavill et al.,
2011), or to infer important biological functions of two different
conditions from biological categories, such as Gene Ontology
(GO; Beissbarth and Speed, 2004; Zeeberg et al., 2003).

We introduce a novel method called Over-Representation of
Correlation Analysis (ORCA) that seeks to combine both con-
ventional approaches for analysis of coordinated biological re-
sponses and provide a new means to test for an unexpectedly
high prevalence of informative associations between two sets of
variables, which could be mRNA, microRNA or proteins, that
comprise pathways/groups deemed of importance a priori. The
method first calculates the correlation coefﬁcients between all the
variables in the dataset, in which the variables can be divided
into groups according to pre-deﬁned criteria (exclusive group-
ings). Then, as an analogy to counting ‘differentially’ expressed

Over-representation of correlation analysis

 

genes in ORA (which might be below or above a certain thresh-
old of P-Values or other metrics), ORCA deﬁnes the number of
correlation coefﬁcients that are ‘above’ a certain threshold within
each group. Finally, the probability of association between any
two-group pair is calculated in a similar fashion to the calcula-
tion of over-representation in the conventional ORA. This prob-
ability value is calculated from the number of correlation
coefficients that pass a threshold against the background
number of correlation coefficients of the two-group pairs and
overall correlation coefficients by using the hypergeometric
test. The correlation coefﬁcient threshold can be empirically
chosen or calculated by a Shannon’s entropy-based threshold
selection. The method was applied to several biological datasets
to demonstrate the concept and implications of ORCA in biolo-
gical data analysis.

2 METHODS

To apply ORCA, the variables (such as genes, microRNA or proteins) of
the dataset must be divided into sets according to relevant criteria, such as
GO annotations, KEGG pathways or groups, resulting from unsuper-
vised classiﬁcation techniques such as hierarchical clustering. There
should also be as many data points available for an accurate correlation
coefﬁcient as possible between two variables.

All statistical calculations and plots were made using R statistical
packages version 2.12. The P-values were all adjusted by Benjaminii
Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) procedure (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 2009).

2.1 Over-representation of correlation analysis

A schematic representation of ORCA is shown in Figure l. Firstly, the
method starts with calculation of the correlation coefﬁcients between
all n variables, yielding a symmetric correlation matrix (n xn matrix).
We chose Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcients in this study to
avoid the assumption of a Normal distribution. Secondly, variables
are sorted into sets or groups according to a priori information,
such as pathways, GO (sets 176 in Fig. 1). Correlation coefﬁcients
between variables in the same group are called within-group correl-
ations, whereas the ones between different groups are called between-
group correlations. Thirdly, all correlation coefﬁcients are labelled as
above or below a certain threshold previously established by empirical
means or a threshold selection method (see Section 2.2). The associ-
ation between sets or groups is then quantiﬁed by the number of
correlation coefﬁcients between those two groups that are above the
threshold.

To determine the signiﬁcance of the association between groups, we
introduce ORCA. The total number of correlation coefﬁcients in the
correlation matrix of the dataset (N) in the analysis can be categorized
in two ways:

(i) correlation coefﬁcients that are above the threshold (X of Venn
diagram in Fig. 1)

(ii) correlation coefﬁcients that link members of a particular pair of
groups (M of Venn diagram in Fig. 1)

For any association between two groups, these criteria deﬁne four
different categories of correlation coefﬁcients (see contingency table in
Fig. l). The number of correlation coefﬁcients that are both above the
threshold and are members of a particular pair of groups (k in contin-
gency table in Fig. l) is the determinant of association between the pair of
groups being calculated (we used association between sets 1 and 6 as an
example in Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. The concept of over-representation of correlation. A matrix of
correlation coefﬁcients calculated from a dataset is divided into sets or
groups. Correlation coefﬁcients are represented by rectangles in each
group pair. Non-ﬁlled and crosshatch-ﬁlled rectangles represent correl-
ation coefﬁcients that do not pass and do pass a certain threshold, re-
spectively. The contingency table in the bottom right explains the
variables required to calculate the probability value of having a certain
number of correlation coefﬁcients that pass the threshold in each group
pair by chance alone via the hypergeometric distribution (Equation 1)

Finally, we calculate the P-value of obtaining, by chance, the number
of correlation coefﬁcients that pass the threshold and are present in
each set of between-group correlations (Supplementary Fig. Sl). This
can be calculated by the hypergeometric distribution:

(MW—M)
k . .
p(n>k)=l—Z ' X_’ (1)

 <:>

where   is the binomial coefﬁcient, M is the number of
between-group correlation coefﬁcients, N is the total number of correl-
ation coefﬁcients in the correlation matrix (excluding within-group
correlations), X is the total number of between-group correlation
coefﬁcients that pass the threshold and k is the number of correlation
coefﬁcients in the between-group set of interest that pass the threshold.

The reason for excluding within-group correlation coefﬁcients that
pass the threshold is that these tend to have high correlation coefﬁcients
and will cause an underestimation of the P-value calculating from be-
tween-group correlation. The P-values for within-group correlations were
separately calculated using the same equation but including within-group
correlations in N, M and X.

2.2 Threshold selection

To select a threshold of correlation coefﬁcient that yields the most infor-
mation from the data, a selection method based on Shannon’s entropy
(Shannon, 1948) was developed. Brieﬂy, a score is calculated for a range

of correlation coefﬁcient thresholds based on the P-values from ORCA
for all group pairs using the equation (2):

.I
H(X) = — Exxolog ape» (2)
i=1

where H( X ) is a Shannon entropy-like score, P(x,-) is a P-value of a
within- or between-group association calculated by hypergeometric test,
J is the total number of within- and between-group pairs [if the total
number of groups is n then J = n(n71)/2 -l- n] and loge is the natural
logarithm. The correlation coefﬁcient that yields the highest Shannon
entropy-like score is selected for the ORCA threshold.

2.3 Permutation analysis

As the variables in the correlation matrix are not necessarily independent,
permutation analysis was used to determine the null distribution of the
P-values obtained by the hypergeometric test for a given data matrix.
Speciﬁcally the group membership of each variable in the dataset was
permuted, but the group structure (i.e. the number of groups and the
number of variables within each group) together with the overall distri-
bution of correlations was retained. For each dataset, one million per-
mutations were performed, and the empirical P-values of each between
and within groups were calculated by using the following equation
(Davison and Hinkley, 1997):

_(r-l-1)
’(n+1)

 

(3)

where P is the empirical P-value, r is the number of times that the hyper-
geometric P-values from permutation test are equal or less than the actual
P-values from ORCA and n is the total number of permutation used in
the test.

3 RESULTS

3.1 ORCA reveals an association between the sensitivity
of tumour cells to alkylating agents and topoisomerase
inhibitors

To demonstrate the concept and potential of ORCA, we exam-

ined publicly available phenotypic profiles from the National

Cancer Institute cell line panel (NCI-60 panel). This dataset

meets the basic requirements of ORCA: the variables can be

divided into groups and each variable has multiple data points
for correlation analysis. This dataset consists of drug sensitivity
data associated with the NCI-60 cell panel: proﬁles of 58 cancer
cell lines treated with a range of drug compounds (Scherf et al.,

2000). The effect of a drug on a cell line was represented by the

concentration of the drug that lead to 50% growth inhibition

(G150). We selected a collection of well-validated results for 116

chemotherapeutic drugs and divided them into nine groups ac-

cording to their mechanisms of action, i.e. the molecular targets
of the drugs. Our objective was to determine whether there
was similarity between different groups of drugs in terms of the
sensitivity pattern across the cell lines. The dataset is detailed in

Supplementary data ﬁles S1 and S2 and Supplementary Figure S2.

Despite a wide range of different mechanisms of action, some
of the drugs from different classes have an apparently high
degree of similarity in the observed sensitivity proﬁle, as

observed in the correlation matrix of the GI50 data (Fig. 2).

We used ORCA to determine whether any two drug classes,

deﬁned by independent modes of action, have more common

coefﬁcients between two drugs, respectively. The sizes of circles and
squares reﬂect the strength of correlation. The ﬁlled circles and squares
are correlation coefﬁcients that pass the threshold of 0.79. The lines
divide drugs into their groups according to their mechanisms of actions.
The number labels are NSC numbers (NCI’s sample accession number)
of the drugs. The drug names are given in Supplementary Material. Note
the unusually high number of positive correlations between alkylating
agents (group 1) and topoisomerase inhibitors (group 8)

correlations that are above an informative threshold than we
would expect between them by chance. For this dataset, our
threshold selection method identiﬁed a correlation coefﬁcient
of 0.79 to produce the highest Shannon entropy-like score,
i.e. to be the most informative (Supplementary Fig. S3). Using
this threshold, ORCA was then applied to generate a matrix of
P-Values for obtaining the observed number of high correlations,
between every possible pair of groups of drugs (Table 1). The
analysis revealed that the similarity in sensitivity proﬁle across
the NCI-60 panel between alkylating agents (group 1) and topo-
isomerase inhibitors (group 8) was much higher than expected by
chance (q = 1e-6, Benjamini-Hochberg FDR). This ﬁnding has
not previously been reported and could result in part by the fact
that both sets of compounds are likely to lead to single and
double-stranded DNA breaks in rapidly dividing cells, which
leaves the cells reliant on a common set of DNA repair pathways
for survival (Bargonetti et al., 2010; Rudolf et al., 2011). Another
pair of drug classes exhibiting higher than expected association
was DNA synthesis inhibitor (group 5) and ribonucleotide
reductase inhibitor (group 6), albeit at a lesser extent than alky-
lating agents and topoisomerase inhibitors.

microRNA expression of the 60 cancer cell lines. The primary
objective for using these datasets in ORCA is to verify the group-
ings (clusters) generated in miRConnect study (Hua et al., 2011).
The secondary objective is to identify any interaction between
these clusters.

The miRConnect study attempted to cluster microRNAs using
a new correlation scheme (summed Pearson Correlation coeffi-
cient or sPCC) between baseline microRNA expression proﬁles
and gene expression profiles from the same cell line panel. The
study divided 136 microRNAs into 13 clusters according to the
correlation patterns between microRNAs and gene expression of
selected gene signatures. We focused on the microRNAs, which
overlapped in both datasets, resulting in 124 microRNAs for this
analysis.

Although the two datasets have the same structure, the data
were generated using different microarray technologies, thus re-
sulting in different microRNA proﬁles (see Supplementary ﬁles
S3 and S4; Supplementary Figure S4 and S5). The threshold
selection method determined correlation coefﬁcient thresholds
for Liu et al. (2010) and Sokilde et al. (2011) to be 0.29 and
0.61, respectively. Figure 3 shows correlation matrices of the
two datasets and Tables 2 and 3 show FDR-adjusted P-Values
resulting from ORCA of the correlation matrices corresponding
to the correlation matrices for Liu et al. (2010) and Sokilde et al.
(2011) datasets, respectively.

At the thresholds identiﬁed previously for the two datasets,
ORCA conﬁrmed that several clusters as proposed by Hua et al.
(2011) contain signiﬁcant within-group over-representation of
correlations at an FDR-adjusted significance level of 0.05 in
both datasets, which are clusters I, IV, V, X and XIII.

Notes: P—values in grey—shaded cells are the group pairs that have the number of
correlation coefﬁcients higher than expected that pass the threshold of 0.61 (FDR—
adjusted and empirical P—value<0.05). P—values in bold are the clusters and cluster
pair that passed the threshold and overlapped with another microRNA dataset (also
correspond to the arrows on right panel in Fig. 3).

Considering associations between clusters, ORCA identiﬁed sev-
eral cluster pairs where between-group correlations were overre-
presented, but only one cluster pair had over-representation of
correlations in both datasets: cluster pair X/XIII.

The finding that clusters I, IV, V, X and XIII contain over-
representation of correlation as seen by ORCA supports the hy-
pothesis that miRNAs within these clusters are controlled by the
same transcription factors, located at the same chromosomal
regions or involved in the same processes or pathways.

The signiﬁcant association of cluster pair X/XIII could be
explained by the fact that several of the miRNAs in the two
clusters possess similar seed sequences, i.e. let-7 family, mir-23
family, mir-27 family, mir-125 family and mir-99/ 100 family
(Lewis et al., 2005). This fact was not reported in the original
study and might suggest that these two clusters be best con-
sidered as a single superfamily of miRNAs.

Other potentially related clusters we identified by ORCA, i.e.
cluster pairs II/IV and V/VI, were less easy to be rationalized,
as clusters 2 and 6 did not exhibit signiﬁcant within-group

Over-representation of correlation analysis

 

over-representation of correlation suggest possible misclassiﬁca-
tion in the original clustering of these miRNA families.

Interestingly, a follow-up study Hua et al. (2013) observed that
clusters I and V appeared to be functionally antagonistic to
miRNAs in cluster XIII, i.e. had the opposite effect on the
same set of mRNAs. ORCA was able to identify signiﬁcant
over-representation of (predominantly negative) correlations be-
tween clusters I and XIII and between clusters V and XIII in one
of the microarray datasets (Fig. 4). This highlighted the potential
of ORCA to detect such functional antagonism by analysis of
miRNA co-expression alone.

4 DISCUSSION

ORCA can be used as pathway analysis tool, but the research
question will be different from existing pathway or gene set ana-
lysis methods. Current methods identify pathways that are sig-
niﬁcantly enriched or depleted with respect to genes associated to
a biological condition, while ORCA can identify pathways that
are associated through correlations. Although the examples
given here were not of typical pathways, ORCA can be applied
to any type of pathway or gene set to determine pathways that
are associated. In terms of pathway analysis, ORCA addresses
some limitations of existing pathway analysis methods that were
presented by Khatri et al. (2012). First, whereas ORA does not
take the actual levels of variables (such as gene expression or
metabolite levels) into consideration, ORCA can take these
values into account, although indirectly, through the correlation
coefﬁcient calculation, which means that ORCA does not weigh
the variables equally. Second, by using correlation, ORCA does
not assume that the variables are independent, which is usually
an important assumption in typical ORA implementations.

Third, classical ORA only uses variables, such as mRNAs or
microRNAs, that are deemed most differentially expressed, while
ORCA uses all the data in the calculation. Fourth, pathway
analysis tools based on ORA use multiple testing corrections
that assume independence of each pathway. ORCA, on the
other hand, assumes the opposite and looks for the association
between two sets of variables. Because our method is based on
the hypergeometric test, it could be argued that ORCA violates
the assumptions of the independence of each data point by using
correlation coefﬁcients as the source data. This may lead to in-
accurate P-value calculations from the test. Goeman and
Biihlmann (2007) have shown in simulated data that when hyper-
geometric test was used in correlated datasets, the calculated
P-values will be underestimated. Possible remedies for the under-
estimated P-values could be multiple comparisons procedures,
such as Bonferroni correction or BenjaminiiHochberg FDR cor-
rection (which was applied in this study). A table showing the
nominal alpha level for correlated data from Goeman and
Biihlmann (2007) can also be used to select a suitable alpha
level according to a correlation threshold. A limitation of this
approach is that in the simulation experiment mentioned above,
all the data points have the same correlation coefﬁcient. An al-
ternative test that could be used instead of the hypergeometric
test is the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, where the comparison is
between the number of correlation coefﬁcients in one group-
pair and all other group-pairs.

ORCA can be used in pathway analysis in the same way as
tools based on ORA. However, the information that will be
derived from ORCA relates speciﬁcally to the pathway inter-
actions. For pathway or gene set analysis, ORCA can calculate
the correlation coefﬁcients between genes or metabolites and
then ﬁnd the pathway-pairs that have more correlation coefﬁ-
cients that pass a certain threshold (determined by the threshold
selection method or by other means) than expected.

Our version of ORCA requires group membership of variables
to be mutually exclusive. Therefore, it cannot yet be used with
pathway data where group members overlap, i.e. variables
can not belong to more than one group. This is the subject of
future work.

Recently gene co-function networks were used to identify
cross-category association between different GO classes
(CroGo, Peng et al., 2013). However, CroGO does not explicitly
include gene expression values into the analysis and, therefore,
could miss actual association between GO categories in the real
biological context. In this regard, ORCA can be a crucial down-
stream analysis to CroGO to highlight associations between GO
categories that are of greatest importance, using gene expression
to complement the associations identiﬁed by CroGO.

In conclusion, ORCA is a new method that combines analysis
of correlation with ORA, and has the potential to reveal other-
wise obscured associations between sets of variables, whether
they are genes, proteins, metabolites or other molecular signals,
in a wide variety of biological datasets. Although the method has
clear application in ‘-omics’ data analysis, ORCA can be proﬁt-
able in any circumstance where an association network can be
constructed between variables that can be classiﬁed into mean-
ingful sets.

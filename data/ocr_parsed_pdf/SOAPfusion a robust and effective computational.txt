ABSTRACT

Motivation: RNA-Seq provides a powerful approach to carry out ab ini-
tio investigation of fusion transcripts representing critical translocation
and post-transcriptional events that recode hereditary information.
Most of the existing computational fusion detection tools are chal-
lenged by the issues of accuracy and how to handle multiple mappings.
Results: We present a novel tool SOAPfusion for fusion discovery with
paired-end RNA-Seq reads. SOAPfusion is accurate and efficient for
fusion discovery with high sensitivity (393%), low false-positive rate
(51.36%), even the coverage is as low as 10x, highlighting its ability
to detect fusions efficiently at low sequencing cost. From real data of
Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR) samples, SOAPfusion
detected 7 novel fusion genes, more than other existing tools and all
genes have been validated through reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction followed by Sanger sequencing. SOAPfusion thus
proves to be an effective method with precise applicability in search
of fusion transcripts, which is advantageous to accelerate pathological
and therapeutic cancer studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Fusion transcript, the new transcript transcribed casually from
two parental genes, may emerge through chromosomal
rearrangements (Kumar-Sinha et al., 2008) or intergenic splicing
(Akiva et al., 2006; Horiuchi et al., 2006; Li et al., 2008b). Given
their important roles in cancer development and progression
(Kantarjian et al., 2002; Kumar-Sinha et al., 2008; Maher
et al., 2009a, b; Mitelman et al., 2007; Teixeira et al., 2006),
some known fusions have been successfully used as biomarkers
for development of inhibitors triggering cancer remission,
e.g. BCRiABLI fusion in treating chronic myelogenous leuke-
mia (CML) (Kantarjian et al., 2002). Consequently, it is of

enormous biological and therapeutic signiﬁcance to locate such
fusion events.

Early studies mainly resorted to expressed sequence tag (Akiva
et al., 2006; Li et al., 2009), array CGH (Shadeo and Lam, 2006)
or end sequence proﬁling (Hampton et al., 2009; Volik et al.,
2006) to seek for fusions. However, such methods were largely
constrained by their limited sequencing throughput and uneco-
nomic cost (Mortazavi et al., 2008). With the emergence of
next-generation sequencing technologies, RNA-Seq has been
introduced as an excellent technique in fusion discovery
(Mortazavi et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2010), and, in particular,
paired-end (PE) sequencing was proved to exhibit distinguished
strengths in both productivity and sensitivity (Maher et al.,
2009a, b).

The general idea of fusion detection from RNA-Seq data is to
align all reads to a reference genome or transcriptome and then
explore alignments carrying potential fusion features to call
fusions. Early computational detection approaches ﬁrst narrow
down regions containing possible fusions with PE reads intactly
mapped to the reference, and then search for the fusion junctions
with remaining reads that mapped to those regions intactly.
Nevertheless, with successful application of segmental alignment
strategy in some splicing junction detection tools, e.g. MapSplice
(Wang et al., 2010) and SOAPsplice (Huang et al., 2011), a
bunch of computational approaches have been proposed, includ-
ing FusionSeq (Sboner et al., 2010), ShortFuse (Kinsella et al.,
2011), FusionHunter (Li et al., 2011), FusionMap (Ge et al.,
2011), deFuse (McPherson et al., 2011) and TopHat-Fusion
(Kim and Salzberg, 2011), to consider all segmental alignment
of reads in addition to intact alignment.

These current methods vary in performance and ability in
fusion detection. Roughly speaking, the performance of these
methods rely on their ability to precisely detect the reads encom-
passing fusion junctions (fusion reads), as those reads served as
the major evidences for fusion events and could only be segmen-
tally mapped to references. To obtain speciﬁc fusion junctions,
current tools align potential fusion reads to combinations of can-
didate exons (e.g. FusionSeq, ShortFuse, FusionHunter,
FusionMap and deFuse) or split those reads into fixed segments
for reference alignment (e.g. FusionMap and TopHat-Fusion).
This induces higher computational requirement on alignment
and/or not easy to solve segmental mapping problems such as

multiple mappings. What is more, most of these tools did not
perform well under low coverage. As a remark, the existence of
multiple mappings (many of them are believed to be incorrect)
increases the false discovery rate (FDR; e.g. in ShortFuse,
deFuse and TopHat-Fusion). On the other hand, simply remov-
ing them decreases the sensitivity as in FusionHunter.

In this article, we present a novel tool called SOAPfusion to
identify fusion transcripts with RNA-Seq reads. SOAPfusion
integrates a specially designed SOAPfusion-aligner to perform
both intact alignment and two-segmental alignment. With a
masking strategy on the reference genome and retention of reli-
able multiple mappings to report fusions, SOAPfusion provides a
proper way to make better use of multiple mapping results. Our
experiments show that SOAPfusion is an effective tool for de-
tecting fusions at various sequencing coverage even as low as
10x, thus enabling us to identify fusion events at low cost in
cancer studies, and in the long run, eventually advance clinical
treatment to cancers. In real data, SOAPfusion was able to detect
more novel fusion genes than existing tools, in Universal Human
Reference RNA (UHRR) samples, all have been validated
through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-
PCR) followed by Sanger sequencing.

2 METHODS
2.1 System design for SOAPfusion

As the majority of all validated fusions have the fusion sites at exon
boundaries (Berger et al., 2010; Edgren et al., 2011; Levin et al., 2009;
Sboner et al., 2010), also demonstrated by canonical fusion mechanisms
(Akiva et al., 2006; Horiuchi et al., 2006; Kumar-Sinha et al., 2008;
Li et al., 2008b), the main workﬂow of SOAPfusion tries to identify
fusion transcripts with fusion sites at exon boundaries using RNA-Seq
PE reads. In the ﬁrst step, SOAPfusion masks non-exonic regions of the
reference genome with a series of ‘N’ sequences. Then SOAPfusion uses
SOAPfusion-aligner to map all reads to the masked reference genome. In
the ﬁrst alignment stage, all reads are mapped with intact alignment
module. Those unmapped ones are continued to the second alignment
stage, the two-segmental alignment module. Roughly speaking, there are
two types of fusion supporting reads that are required to recover in all
fusion detection approaches, the fusion reads (i.e. one of paired reads
encompassing fusion site, whereas the other one from either side of fusion
site) and the fusion spanning reads (i.e. one read on each side of the
fusion site) (Fig. 1A). Thereby, SOAPfusion hunts fusion reads and
fusion spanning reads from SOAPfusion-aligner output. Next,
SOAPfusion makes use of fusion reads to locate fusion candidates and
then calls reliable fusions with supports from fusion spanning reads.
Candidates that come from two genes of the same gene family and
with none of the fusion supporting reads having unique mappings were
ﬁltered out. After that, SOAPfusion reports sets of most reliable fusion
candidates. The main workﬂow is depicted in Figure 1B.

For fusion transcripts with fusion sites from intergenic regions or
introns, we use TopHat-Fusion (Kim and Salzberg, 2011) to detect
them after the main workﬂow. In this supplementary step, we use
un-masked reference genome and all un-mapped reads (neither intactly
nor two-segmentally mapped) returned by SOAPfusion-aligner as input
to TopHat-Fusion. In the reported set of fusion candidates by TopHat-
Fusion, we only retain those with at least one fusion site in intergenic
regions or introns. Fusion candidates from main workﬂow and supple-
mentary step are included in the ﬁnal set of reported fusions.

Fig. 1. (A) Two types of fusion supporting reads. (B) Workﬂow of
SOAPfusion. SOAPfusion ﬁrst masks non-exon regions on genome ref-
erence, then maps PE reads to the masked reference genome with intact
alignment and, if necessary, two-segmental alignment, calls fusions with
fusion reads and adds fusion spanning reads to enhance conﬁdence.
Insert size of fusion supporting reads should follow the normal distribu-
tion according to the three-sigma rule (Smirnov and Dunin-Barkovskii,
1969). In the last step, SOAPfusion sifts most reliable fusions after using
similarity ﬁlters

2.2 Masking algorithm

Based on gene annotation ﬁle obtained from UCSC database (http://
genome.ucsc.edu), our program keeps all exon regions of human refer-
ence genome hg 18 (Build 37) and replaces all nucleotide bases within
non-exon regions with ‘N’s by hard-masking (Baxevanis et al., 2001).
In case of overlapping exons among variant transcripts of the same
gene, the longest exon as the non-masked region is kept. Then index of
masked reference genome is built with bi-directional Burrow Wheeler
Transformation algorithm (Lam et al., 2008).

2.3 SOAPfusion-aligner algorithm

In intact alignment, all reads and their reversed complements are aligned
to the index, with at most three mismatches (with option -m) or two
indels (with option -g) allowed in each alignment by default.
Considering that single nucleotide polymorphism occurs more frequently
than indels (Li et al., 2008c), a higher penalty score is given to indels (:1)
than mismatch (20.5) in mapping. Mappings with smallest penalty scores
are returned. For those less reliable bases at the 3’-end of read owing to
the limitations of sequencing technology (Hillier et al., 2008), we cut off
3’ tails of unmapped reads after the above steps by 7bp (default), and
then map the remaining part and their reversed complements to the index
allowing errors in the same way as described above. Afterward, for the
reads that still fail to be mapped, they will be further mapped with the
two-segmental alignment procedure.

SOAPfusion

 

In two-segmental alignment, we ﬁrst get two longest aligned segments
in both forward and backward directions, with three requirements: each
segment be longer than 8bp; alignment allows no more than one mis-
match and no indels; and alignments must have canonical splice sites
(GT/AG). If the two longest mapped sequences overlap, we try the divid-
ing site within the overlapped regions from 3’- to S’-end until a hit is
found; if there is no overlap, the two longest mapped segments would be
counted as the best segmentation. In this step, priorities for types of
mismatches allowed in two segments are (0, 0) > (0, 1)>(1, 0)>(1, 1)
[‘>’ means better].

2.4 Fusion discovery algorithm

To prepare the most informative mapping results for fusion discovery,
we pre-process the outputs from SOAP-fusion module as follows:
(i) According to the observation that non-fusion-supporting reads
occupy a great portion of the mapping results while they actually are
not useful in the fusion discovery stage, we remove non-fusion-supporting
mappings from the original set of mapping results, thus reducing greatly
the time and memory cost. (ii) Multiple mapping results with high con-
ﬁdence (deﬁned later in the text) are chosen to call candidates by default.
If one read in intact alignment or two segments in two-segmental align-
ment have fewer than six (this value is set empirically, intuitively, if an
alignment has only a few mapping positions, the alignment result should
be reliable) multiple mappings in total, all its mappings are used in the
discovery stage; furthermore, if one segment has multiple mappings, only
the mappings with the least number of errors (including mismatch and
indels) are kept.

Fusion candidates are ﬁrst called with fusion reads from two-segmen-
tal mappings. It is required that the mapping distance between two ends
of fusion read should follow the normal distribution of insert size in
sequencing according to the three-sigma rule (Smirnov and Dunin-
Barkovskii, 1969). Exact fusion site is calculated according to the map-
ping position, the mapping orientation and the mapping strand. Then we
add evidence to fusion candidates with fusion spanning reads, from both
intact alignment and two-segmental alignment results. Mapping distance
of these fusion spanning reads should also follow the same rule as fusion
reads. Finally, fusion candidates with at least one fusion read and at least
one fusion spanning reads supported are considered as reliable ones and
are reported in two lists: the ﬁrst list contains those obtained from unique
mappings, whereas the second list contains those obtained from using
multiple mappings.

One particular concern at this stage is the calculation of insert size.
In case of alternative splicing events, we use a maximum principle, i.e. the
insert size is calculated based on the union of all transcripts from the same
gene (Supplementary Fig. S2).

2.5 Similarity ﬁlters
We remove fusion candidates with homologous gene pairs based on the

annotation ﬁle from TreeFam database (http://www.treefam.org) and
those fusions only supported with multiple mappings.

3 RESULTS

3.1 The data

The melanoma and CML datasets were downloaded from NCBI
Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE17593.
The breast cancer dataset was downloaded from NCBI Sequence
Read Archive under accession number SRA: SRP003186. The
UHRR dataset can be retrieved from NCBI SRA database with
accession number SRA054573.

3.2 Library construction, sequencing and validation

One microgram of total RNA was isolated from UHRR sample
(Agilent, Catalog number 740 000), which comprises 10 human
cell lines of mammary gland, liver, cervix, testis, brain, melan-
oma, liposarcoma, histocyte, T lymphoblast and B lymphocyte,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and was subse-
quently treated with RNase-free DNase I for 15min at 370C to
remove residual DNA. Libraries were prepared according to the
Illumina’s protocol. Poly (A) RNA was isolated using the
oligo(dT) beads (Dynabeads® mRNA Puriﬁcation Kit;
Invitrogen, Catalog number 610.06). On chemical fragmentation,
double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from these RNA sam-
ples using random hexameriprimer and reverse transcriptase
(Superscript II; Invitrogen; Catalog number 18 064-014).
Following the synthesis of second strand, end repair, adenylate
of 3’-ends and adaptor ligation, cDNA was further size-selected
on agarose gels (~200 bp). After enrichment of cDNA template
by PCR, concentrations and sizes of libraries were measured
using DNA 1000 kit (Agilent) on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer,
and concentrations were also conﬁrmed by qPCR. Then the PE
cDNA libraries were sequenced on HiSeqTM 2000 Sequencing
System (Illumina) at 90 bp.

We validated fusion candidates by region-speciﬁc PCR amp-
lification of cDNA, which was synthesized from Sag of total
RNA using the reagents from Invitrogen and TAKARA.
Following PCR and gel electrophoresis, all PCR-ampliﬁed
bands were gel-excised and subjected to Sanger sequencing. All
the speciﬁc primers and candidate sequences around fusion site
are listed in Supplementary Table S9.

3.3 Stepwise evaluation of SOAPfusion

To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in a full scale,
we designed simulation experiments to test the workflow in a
stepwise manner.

We simulated 300 fusion transcripts based on 31399 human
RefSeq (Pruitt et al., 2007) transcripts. First, by randomly pick-
ing up two transcripts and two exon boundaries of them, we
joined the two transcripts to form fusion transcripts at the
picked exon boundaries. Also, by randomly picking up one
non-exonic site and one exon boundary, we joined them to simu-
late fusion transcripts with fusion sites from intergenic regions or
introns. In total, 300 fusions were simulated. Then we ran MAQ
(Li et al., 2008a) on the new transcriptome (including all RefSeq
transcripts and the newly simulated fusion transcripts) to simu-
late PE reads. In total, we generated seven sets of simulated reads
under sequencing depth 1x, 5x, 10x, 20x, 30x, 40x and 50x,
ﬁle sizes of which are 242 Mb, 1.19 Gb, 2.40 Gb, 4.80 Gb,
7.20 Gb, 9.60 Gb and 12Gb, respectively.

We ﬁrst assessed the masking strategy by running SOAPfusion
with masked reference genome and original reference genome
(non-masked), respectively, on 50x simulated dataset
(64 150 124 reads in total). Results showed that higher sensitivity
and lower FDR were achieved with masking (97.66% and
1.67%) compared with non-masking (89.67% and 3.72%). We
checked the read alignments and revealed that the masking strat-
egy (94.51%) mapped more reads than non-masking strategy
(89.17%), while all reads mapped with non-masking were cov-
ered in masking. To investigate the power of masking, we looked

at the reads that were only mapped with masking. It was found
that 85.31% of them could not be mapped to the non-masked
genome because they either span more than two exons (33.33%)
or contain more sequencing errors (51.98%) than allowed (one
mismatch) in segmental mapping. Additionally, we compared
cases of multiple mappings between masking and non-masking
and found that the number of multiple mapped reads dropped
from 4298 624 in non-masking to 1210695 in masking.

Among 410 fusion supporting reads of 28 fusions detected
only with masking, 391 (95.4%) reads have unique mappings
with masking. We also compared time cost and memory con-
sumption between two strategies. For 64 million reads, masking
strategy took 14h and 0.72 Gb memory, whereas non-masking
took 21 h and 5.0 Gb memory. All in all, the advantages of using
the masking strategy for improving sensitivity, reducing FDR,
saving time and memory are obvious.

Then we measured the performance of SOAPfusion-aligner
focusing on two-segmental alignment, given that fusion reads
are the keys to fusion discovery and all mapped with segmental
alignment. On average, SOAPfusion-aligner mapped 78.10% of
fusion reads to the correct fusion junctions under all coverage,
while for Bowtie used by deFuse (McPherson et al., 2011), the
rate is 55.36% (Supplementary Table S1). Accordingly,
SOAPfusion-aligner performs two-segmental alignment more
accurately and effectively.

We next evaluated the effect of using multiple mappings in
SOAPfusion. Although we used the masking strategy to reduce
multiple mapping results to the best extent, there were still some
reads mapped to multiple locations because of repetitive regions
among some exons. We compared sensitivity and FDR when
counting fusions only reported from unique mappings (U) and
fusions reported from both unique and multiple mappings
(U+ M) (Supplementary Table S2). In simulated datasets,
when the coverage increases, it is clear that the increases in the
number of true fusions (based on U + M) are a lot more than the
increases in false fusions reported. By aggregating fusions called
from both unique mappings and multiple mappings,
SOAPfusion achieved high sensitivity while maintaining reason-
ably low FDR.

Also, we tested the role of similarity filters in improving
SOAPfusion’s performance (Supplementary Table S3). For
simulated dataset under 50x, 82 of 380 fusions reported were
removed, including 55 candidates with parental genes coming
from the same gene family and 27 candidates only called from
multiple mappings, helping to deduce the FDR from 22.37% to
1.67%.

To summarize, the major reasons that SOAPfusion can out-
perform other existing tools are as follows: (i) With masking, we
are able to increase the mapping ratio and reduce the number of
multiple mappings of fusion supporting reads; (ii) our RNA-seq
aligner is able to align the fusion spanning reads in an accurate
and efficient way; and (iii) by properly handling multiple map-
pings, we achieve a better balance between retaining more fusion
supporting reads and having too many false alignments.

with simulated datasets. Labels stand for sensitivity (A) and FDR (B) of
each tool with simulated dataset under speciﬁc coverage (5x to 50x)
conﬁrming the conﬁdence of its predictions

assessments on the whole workﬂow. As summarized in Figure
2 and Supplementary Table S4, SOAPfusion achieved overall
high sensitivity on all datasets except 1x. For datasets under
high coverage (20, 30, 40 and 50x), sensitivity of SOAPfusion
even approached to 100% (397%). One reason for missing some
fusions (6 in 20x, 2 in 30x, 2 in 40x and 2 in 50x) is that their
fusion reads contained more than three mismatches in segmental
mappings, whereas SOAPfusion only allows at most one mis-
match for each segment by default. Another reason is that
some fusions (3 in 20x, 3 in 30x, 2 in 40x, and 2 in 50x)
have fusion reads with more than six multiple mapping positions
and thus were skipped in our algorithm. For datasets under ex-
tremely low coverage, SOAPfusion had relatively lower sensitiv-
ity, obviously in the case of 1x coverage (only 10.33%). From
observation, we found that under such low coverage, fewer fu-
sions are covered by fusion supporting reads (Supplementary
Fig. S1), and some of them were furthermore missed after map-
ping if they contained more errors than allowed. Nevertheless,
SOAPfusion recovered 73.67% and 93.33% of total simulated
fusions under the coverage of 5 and 10x, respectively. Such per-
centages are acceptable considering the low sequencing cost.
Thus, SOAPfusion is efﬁcient in detecting fusions under both
high and low coverage. With regard to FDR, SOAPfusion’s
FDR was <1.36% under all given coverage, demonstrating the
accuracy of SOAPfusion.

Moreover, according to Figure 2 and Supplementary
Table S4, when sequencing depth increases to >10x, the per-
formance of SOAPfusion is relatively stable in both sensitivity
(393.33%) and FDR (51.36%). We further examined the over-
lapping set and the unique set of fusions detected among five
datasets (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50x), and found that higher depth
mainly contributed more fusion supporting reads to fusions in
overlapping set, which make them more reliable (Supplementary
Table S5), and 30x coverage is already sufﬁcient for discovering
299 of total 300 fusions.

3.4.2 011 published data For further evaluation, we also ran
SOAPfusion to rediscover validated fusions from original
datasets in previous studies. For melanoma and CML datasets
(Berger et al., 2010), SOAPfusion reported 16 fusions
(Supplementary Tables S6 and S7), for which the average
number of fusion reads and fusion spanning reads were 4.69
and 22.56, respectively; 13 of these fusions have exactly the
same sequences as published (Table 1), while one known fusion
SCAMP2- WDR72 failed to be rediscovered. Two PE reads with
short segments (8 bp and 11 bp) in two-segmental mapping con-
tained evidence for SCAMPZ- WDR72, whereas these segments
were mapped to >100 positions, and thus discarded by
SOAPfusion. For breast cancer datasets (Edgren et al., 2011),
SOAPfusion reported 31 fusions (Supplementary Tables S7
and S8), for which the average number of fusion reads and
fusion spanning reads were 11.86 and 6.55, respectively;
SOAPfusion was able to rediscover 25 of 27 validated fusions
(Table 2), while missed three fusions owing to the following rea-
sons: (i) there was no fusion spanning read for candidate fusion
LAMPI-MCFZ and thus it was removed and (ii) there was no
fusion supporting read for NFS1-PREX1 fusion and this fusion
was not found by all other tools either (Table 2). Note that
ENSG00000236127 is a new gene annotated in hg19 gene anno-
tation, while we used hg18 in this test; after applying hg19 gene
annotation, CSEIL—ENSG00000236127 was correctly recovered.
In brief, SOAPfusion is able to detect known fusions.

3.4.3 Novel fusion discovery Although we detected some novel
fusion candidates in published datasets, we did not know
whether they are correct or not due to the unavailability of
biological samples for validation. To determine whether
SOAPfusion’s ability in detecting novel fusion genes, we
sequenced a UHRR sample (Novoradovskaya et al., 2001) and
ran SOAPfusion with the reads. In total, SOAPfusion reported
seven fusion candidates (Table 3), all of which were validated
using RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary

Table S9). An example is shown in Figure 3, NPEPPS-TBCID3
fusion was formed through (17; 17) (q21.32; q12) translocation
and its fusion site located at exon 12 (5’ -end) of gene NPEPPS
and exons 2 (3’-end) of gene TBC1D3. There are a total of 9
fusion reads and 11 fusion spanning reads supporting this fusion.

3.4.4 Comparison of SOAPfusion with other fusion discovery
tools To compare SOAPfusion with existing fusion discovery
tools, we ran them on both simulated and real datasets.

FusionSeq (v 1.42.1), deFuse (v 0.4.1), FusionHunter (v 1.2),
ShortFuse (v 0.2), FusionMap (v 0.6.1) and TopHat-Fusion
(v 0.1.0) were used to conduct the comparison. To be consistent,
we used reference genome hg18 for all tools. Additionally, to
benchmark the performance of different tools, in the first place
we set the same threshold for the required number of fusion
supporting reads in preliminary experiments. But it was found
that this caused some tools to perform far worse than expected
according to the statements in their publications. Therefore, we
chose to use default parameters or speciﬁed parameters sug-
gested in those publications. All tools are tested under CentOS
V5.5 on a computer of x86_64 architecture with 30 Gb memory.

Generally, for simulated datasets (Fig. 2), SOAPfusion has the
highest sensitivity and the lowest FDR under all coverage;
ShortFuse has the second highest sensitivity but high FDR
(316.13%) under coverage >10x; deFuse has the second highest
sensitivity under coverage <10x and the second lowest FDR
(55.08%) under all coverage; TopHat-Fusion has the third high-
est sensitivity under coverage >10x and low FDR (57.33) under
all coverage; FusionHunter and FusionMap have low sensitiv-
ities (535.67% and 538.33%, respectively) and high FDRs
(334.48% and 362.50%, respectively) under all coverage;
FusionSeq always performed worse than other tools under all
coverage. More details of each tool’s performance in simulated
datasets are given in Supplementary Table S4.

In real datasets (Tables 1 and 2), SOAPfusion correctly redis-
covered the highest number of known fusions (13 of 14 in

14 in melanoma and CML samples and 4 of 27 in breast cancer
samples. Moreover, for UHRR datasets, SOAPfusion detected
seven true fusions, ShortFuse, FusionHunter and TopHat-
Fusion detected only two known fusions; deFuse and
FusionMap still predicted fusions with reversed gene pair orien-
tations; FusionSeq detected only one. Details on fusion detection
results are listed in Supplementary Table S7.

To conclude, in both real datasets and simulated datasets, the
results show that SOAPfusion can provide reliable predictions in
fusion discovery under different sequencing coverage.

4 CONCLUSIONS

With adoption of tailor-made aligner for PE RNA-Seq reads,
SOAPfusion enables accurate and efﬁcient discovery of fusion
transcripts at single-base resolution. SOAPfusion has the highest
sensitivity and lowest FDR among existing tools, and it can per-
form very well even when the coverage is as low as 10x. From
real datasets, we also demonstrate its high rediscovery rate and
ability in discovering novel fusions. SOAPfusion successfully
handles multiple mappings through employment of masking ref-
erence genome before alignment and prudent selection of cred-
ible multiple alignments in fusion discovery. It was demonstrated
that in doing so, on one hand, masking increases the reliability of
predictions by retaining much fewer multiple mappings, and
retrieves those hard-to-ﬁnd fusions with fusion reads craggily
mapped (>2 segments); on the other hand, with adoption of
portion multiple mappings selected in a strict and meticulous

way, SOAPfusion has prominent improvement in sensitivity at
the expense of just a slight increase in FDR.

SOAPfusion detected and validated a NPEPPSeTBC1D3
fusion, from real dataset UHRR (Fig. 3). We found that both
parental genes of NPEPPSeTBC1D3 fusion took part in other
fusion events, such as OSBPL9eNPEPPS (Kim et al., 2010),
TBC1D3eUSP32 (Bailey et al., 2006; Paulding et al., 2003) and
NPEPP$USP32 (Hampton et al., 2009). In fact, NPEPPS gene
is an inhibitor of tau-induced neurodegeneration (Karsten et al.,
2006). Loss of function mutation on NPEPPS gene will exacer-
bate neurodegeneration (Sengupta et al., 2006). TBC1D3 gene
itself is derived from a segmental duplication (Paulding et al.,
2003), with up to eight paralogs resulting in six variant TBC1D3
proteins (Hodzic et al., 2006). In vitro studies and analyses of
human tumor tissues demonstrated that TBC1D3 expressed
widely in tissues (Paulding et al., 2003) and is an oncogene
with similar cancerogenic mechanisms of TRE2, encoded by
the chimeric fusion of TBC1D3 and USP32 (Hodzic et al.,
2006). Accordingly, we infer that NPEPP$TBC1D3 fusion is
a disruptor in brain, which may be of immense importance,
and calls for further therapeutic studies.

Of course, SOAPfusion is not a panacea for gene fusion
detection. In real situation, besides those described in this
study, the mechanism of fusion can be more complicated and
may require both biological and computational investigation.
Although SOAPfusion now provides an efﬁcient way to ab
initio dissect gene fusions, facilitating the knowledge of genomic
alternation and targets for clinical treatment, fusion discovery is

not a completely solved problem and there is still much space for
further improvement and meaningful questions to explore.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We would like to thank Daniel Nicorici for pointing out that
there are now 40 known fusion genes in the breast cancer data-
sets (see (Kangaspeska et al., 2012)) instead of only 27 we used
for our benchmark. We will investigate these additional fusion
genes in our future work.

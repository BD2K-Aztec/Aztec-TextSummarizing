ABSTRACT

Motivation: With the spreading technique of mass sequencing,
nucleosome positions and scores for their intensity have become
available through several previous studies in yeast, but relatively few
studies have speciﬁcally aimed to determine the score of nucleosome
stability. Based on mass sequencing data, we proposed a nucleo-
some center score (NCS) for quantifying nucleosome stability by mea-
suring shifts of the nucleosome center, and then mapping NCS scores
to nucleosome positions in Brogaard et al.’s study.

Results: We demonstrated the efficiency of NOS by known preference
of A/T-based tracts for nucleosome formation, and showed that
central nucleosomal DNA is more sensitive to A/T-based tracts than
outer regions, which corresponds to the central histone tetramer-
dominated region. We also found significant flanking preference
around nucleosomal DNA for A/T-based dinucleotides, suggesting
that neighboring sequences could affect nucleosome stability.
Finally, the difference between results of N08 and Brogaard et al.’s
scores was addressed and discussed.

1 INTRODUCTION

The nucleosome is a fundamental repeating unit of DNA packa-
ging in eukaryotic chromatin. In yeast, it is composed of a
core containing ~147-bp segments of DNA wrapped around a
histone octamer, which consists of two H2A7H2B dimers and
one (H37H4)2 tetramer. Most of the DNA is wrapped in nucleo-
somes to resemble a string with beads, and neighboring nucleo-
somes are generally separated by linker DNA. Approximately
7&90% of genomic DNA is packaged in nucleosomes. A previ-
ous study indicated that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 81% 0f the
genome sequences appear to be wrapped in nucleosomes (Lee
et al., 2007). The positioning of nucleosomes inﬂuences the ac-
cessibility of proteins to DNA or blocks transcription factor-
binding sites. Consequently, nucleosomes are strongly associated
with chromatin and gene expression, and they can regulate tran-
scription initiation, DNA replication and DNA repair (Liu et al.,
2006; Li et al., 2007). Nucleosome positions, combined with his-
tone variants and histone modiﬁcations, are the key to genome
regulation and gene expression.

In S.cerevisiae, an increasing number of studies have focused
on nucleosome positioning by using several technologies over the
past several years. Early studies for identifying nucleosome
positions primarily relied on the tiled microarray hybridization
approach. The first set of high-throughput positioning data was
generated in 2005 Wuan et al., 2005), followed by the complete
high-resolution map of nucleosome occupancy on a whole
genome (Lee et al., 2007). With the maturity of high-throughput
DNA sequencing technology, many high-resolution maps of
genome-wide nucleosome positions have been made in recent
years (Albert et al., 2007; Brogaard et al., 2012; Field et al.,
2008; Jiang and Pugh, 2009; Kaplan et al., 2009; Weiner et al.,
2010 Mavrich et al., 2008; Rizzo et al., 2011; Tsankov et al.,
2010; Tsui et al., 2011; Xi et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2009;
Whitehouse et al., 2007). Among those data, some nucleosomes
have very consistent positions within the genome, but others are
unstable and varied. Divergence between the data can be caused
by both artiﬁcial and natural factors. The artiﬁcial factors,
including the biological procedure of nucleosome digestion
(Chung et al., 2010), quality of high-throughput technology
and computational method of data processing, make the com-
parisons between different datasets more complicated. As for
natural factors, several determinants, such as distinct DNA se-
quences, DNA methylation, histone variants, post-translational
modiﬁcations, transcription factors and chromatin remodelers,
can affect nucleosome positions (Segal and Widom, 2009b). This
phenomenon of divergence in nucleosome positions led to studies
on the fuzziness or stability of nucleosome positions, such as
‘position cluster’ (Cole et al., 2012). During processing of nucleo-
some positioning data, the nucleosome position and the intensity
for that position can be calculated using several computational
methods; the standard deviation of intensity values was usually
directly used as fuzziness scores to measure the nucleosome dy-
namics or stability in some relevant studies (Albert et al., 2007;
Mavrich et al., 2008). However, based on the design of biological
procedures, such as different concentrations of micrococcal nu-
clease digestion, this standard deviation might not truly represent
the dynamics or stability of nucleosome position, and could pos-
sibly result from digestion preference or bias, or could be affected
by the binding strength between the histone and DNA, instead of
nucleosome dynamics or stability.

In this study, we quantiﬁed nucleosome stability by consider-
ing the shift of nucleosome centers, treating nucleosome stability
as the probability of a nucleosome center in a speciﬁc position,
and determined the probability of shifting by observing differ-
ences between diverging data. Because high-throughput sequen-
cing data have been easily available in recent years, we developed

a computational approach using the Gaussian function to deﬁne
the nucleosome center score (NCS) based on several published
sequencing data of S.cerevisiae under different conditions. Then,
we used both NCS and precise nucleosome positions at base-pair
resolution (Brogaard et al., 2012) to demonstrate the efﬁciency of
NCS and to represent a clear relationship between NCS and
sequence characteristics. With the help of high-resolution
Brogaard et al.’s nucleosome data and a reliable NCS, clear pat-
terns of dinucleotide preference around nucleosomal DNA and
its neighboring DNA were illustrated in our study. Finally, we
also indicated differences between NCS and scores from
Brogaard et al.’s study, and discussed their signiﬁcance.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

In this study, we integrated several published nucleosome positioning
data in S.cerevisiae to calculate NCS, and applied NCS on precise nu-
cleosome positions. We then discussed NCS by sequence characteristics
of nucleosomal DNA. All experimental data were collected from the
following sources:

(1) Raw data of genome-wide sequencing for nucleosome positions
were collected from the Sequence Read Archive database
(Kodama et al., 2012). We chose ﬁve studies (Kaplan et al.,
2009; Rizzo et al., 2011; Tsui et al., 2011; Weiner et al., 2010; Xi
et al., 2011) with the same sequencing platform from Illumina
Genome Analyzer I/II, but on different biological cultures, envir-
onments and micrococcal nuclease digestions (summarized in
Table 1). In total, 30 sequencing datasets on nucleosome positions
in S.cerevisiae were used in this study.

(2) Nucleosome positions at base-pair resolution were obtained from a
previous article (Brogaard et al., 2012). Brogaard et al.’s data are
the ﬁrst to locate nucleosome positions genome wide, with unpre-
cedented detail and accuracy and were regarded as the precise well-
deﬁned nucleosome positions in our study.

(3) Reference genome sequences of S .cerevisiae were downloaded from
the University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Bioinformatics
site (Dreszer et al., 2012). There are three versions for S.cerevisiae:
sacCerl, sacCer2 and sacCer3, which were assembled in 2003, 2008
and 2011, respectively. We adopted the sacCer2 version, which was
also used in Brogaard et al.’s study, for analysis.

(4) The information of open reading frame was obtained from the
study of Xu et a]. (2009), comprising 5171 veriﬁed or uncharacter-
ized transcription start sites (TSSs).

2.2 Detection of nucleosome positions from sequencing
data

For the 30 sequencing data downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive
database, we used Burrows7Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (Li and Durbin,
2009), which is an efﬁcient program that can align short read sequences
against long reference genome sequences to map the nucleosomal DNA
fragments against a reference genome of yeast. SAMtools (Li et al., 2009)
was then used to manipulate the BWA alignment format and generate
alignments in a per-position format, such as the Browser Extensible Data
(BED) format. After the BED format was prepared to record the location
of short reads on the genome, nucleosome positions were estimated by
Nucleosome Positioning from Sequencing (NPS) (Zhang et al., 2008).
NPS is a python software package that can identify peaks of qualifying
width as positioned nucleosomes (PNs). We made the parameters in NPS
more ﬂexible to include as many nucleosomes as possible in each datum
because further information on NCS was based on these nucleosome
positions. According to the amount and quality of sequencing, most
sequencing data can generate ~50 000 PNs in the genome. To ensure
the essential quality of these 30 PN data, comparisons among PNs
were made in the Supplementary Information.

2.3 Calculation of NCS of each base pair

Assuming the nucleosome can possibly be shifted in neighboring pos-
itions, and shifting occurs more easily when the shift distance is smaller,
the data of nucleosome positioning can be considered as the balanced
result of shifting. For each PN i, we applied the Gaussian function as the
kernel probability density function to describe the nucleosome existence
as follows:

 

_ _ mi 1 _(x—c,-)2)
p,(x)—;Umexp( —20, (1)

where [7,-(x) is the probability of nucleosome center existence for nucleo-
tide location x in the genome, and m,- is the total number of PNs in PN i;
for each PN, c, is the nucleosome center, and a is the standard deviation
of reasonable shift distances. According to the observed distribution of
nucleosome shift distance on six duplicated data from Kaplan study
et al.’s (2009), a was set to 10 in our work.

Based on the 30 different PNs with different biological conditions, a
linear combination of probabilities for nucleosome center existence on
each datum was used to calculate the NCS for each base pair. For n PNs,
the values of NCS for each base pair x, NCS(x), was deﬁned as:

NCS(x) = Z Win-(x) (2)
i:l

where w,- is the weight for each data source or the conﬁdence score for the
data. Because our focus is mainly on the shift of nucleosome center rather
than the intensity of the nucleosome, we assumed here that the quality
of each nucleosome positioning datum is the same, and thus treated the
30 sets of nucleosome positioning data equally. The R implementing code
for NCS is released in the Supplementary Data, and the original values of
NCS for each base pair on chromosomes are shown in Supplementary
Table S1.

NCS: quantify nucleosome stability

 

2.4 Application of NCS for data of nucleosomes

NCS is the integration result of 30 PNs, and the value of the NCS is only
a representation of neighboring nucleosome centers. For each base pair, a
high NCS means that the nucleo some center is more stable, whereas a low
NCS suggests an unstable nucleosome center that can easily be affected
by other factors. Because we have a score scheme for nucleosome stability
but no precise nucleosome positions data, nucleosome positions at base-
pair resolution (Brogaard et al., 2012) were used in this work. Although
there have been several nucleosome positioning datasets on a whole
genome in yeast since Lee et al.’s work (2007), no data could reach
base-pair resolution until Brogaard et al.’s study. The signiﬁcant period-
ical pattern of dinucleotide frequency in Brogaard et al.’s study indicates
their precise nucleosome positions because even small noises can lead to a
blurred dinucleotide pattern (Supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore, we
applied NCS on Brogaard et al.’s data by mapping NCS values to the
positions of nucleosome centers and used these values to represent
nucleosome stability. Brogaard et al.’s data, with normalized NCS, are
presented in Supplementary Table S2.

To show that incorporating multiple data (NCS) has an advantage over
single datum in quantifying nucleosome stability, we took one PN as a
reference for the analysis. The data with accession number SRR023800
(Kaplan et al., 2009) were chosen to represent PNs. Because SRR023800
has occupancy scores only for each nucleosome but not for each base pair,
the score cannot be directly applied to Brogaard et al.’s data the same as
NCS. The scores of SRR023800 were applied to Brogaard et al.’s data
by calculating the distance of any two nucleosome positions separately
from SRR023800 and Brogaard et al.’s data, assuming two positions
with a small distance as the same one and keeping these positions, then
applying the SRR023800 score (~67.8% of nucleosomes in Brogaard
et al.’s data were kept and applied by SRR023800 scores).

2.5 Evaluation of the relationship of nucleosome score
with dinucleotide frequency pattern

To initially observe the difference among nucleosomes with different
scores, the nucleosome data were classiﬁed into ﬁve classes in ascending
order of score values, and the aggregate dinucleotide frequency was
drawn separately on each class for viewing. To further represent the
relationship between nucleosome score and dinucleotide frequency pat-
tern, or to measure how pattern changes when score changes, we used the
frequency change rate to describe the degree of dinucleotide frequency
change when the nucleosome score increased. The frequency change
rate for each dinucleotide type was measured as follows. First, the
nucleosome data were classiﬁed into 20 classes based on their scores,
and the aggregate dinucleotide frequency pattern was calculated for
each class. Then, for each location around the nucleosome center, we
used a linear regression to ﬁt the change in dinucleotide frequencies
among the 20 classes, and used the value of the slope from the linear
ﬁt to measure the dinucleotide frequency change rate. The pattern of
frequency change rate indicates the preference or inﬂuence of different
dinucleotide types on nucleosomal DNA.

To provide the degree of conﬁdence on the linearity of frequency
change rate, or to quantify the sensitivity of the dinucleotide feature to
nucleosome score for each location around the nucleosome center, the
sensitivity to dinucleotide was proposed. Combining all the coefﬁcients of
determination, r, from linear regression results for all dinucleotide types,
the sensitivity to dinucleotide frequency change was deﬁned as:

71

Z riISil
Sensitivity = b; (3)
Z ISil

I l

 

where i indicates the dinucleotide type, and s,- and r,- are the slope value
and coefﬁcient of determination (r-squared value) in linear regression,

respectively. The values of sensitivity to dinucleotide were illustrated
with the pattern of dinucleotide frequency rate.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 NCS shows clear discrimination of AA/TT/AT/TA
dinucleotide frequencies

Previous studies suggest that nucleosome positions are highly
related to sequence patterns in vitro and in vivo (Segal et ai.,
2006; Kaplan et ai., 2009, 2010), and sequence information is a
strong determinant for nucleosome formation and inhibition.
Therefore, we used the position-dependent frequencies of AA/
TT/AT/TA dinucleotides to illustrate the difference for nucleo-
some sets with different levels of nucleosome score, and presented
the efﬁciency of NCS. As shown in Figure 1A, Brogaard et al.’s
data were classiﬁed into ﬁve groups according to their NCP/noise
scores deﬁned in the original article (Brogaard et ai., 2012). The
nucleosomes with a large NCP/noise score are well positioned,
and stronger periodic dinucleotide sequence features are favored
in nucleosomes having large NCP/noise, which is consistent with
the original study. However, when classifying Brogaard et al.’s
data according to NCS (depicted in Fig. 1B), we observed better
discrimination of frequency patterns among each class. We also
noticed a very distinct tendency for nucleosome sets with larger
NCS to have lower relative AA/TT/AT/TA frequencies than
those with smaller NCS, indicating that nucleosome positioning
disfavors the A/T-based dinucleotides. This tendency is also sup-
ported by the result of Brogaard et al.’s data classiﬁcation based
on SRR023800 score (Fig. 1C) or SRR023800 classiﬁcation
(Supplementary Fig. S5).

The frequency patterns in Figure 1B and C imply that discrim-
ination in the central region is clearer than the outer region, so the
patterns of absolute AA/TT/AT/TA frequency change rate for
NCS and SRR023800 were illustrated in Figure 2. The smoothing
result for NCS depicts a symmetric pattern surrounding the
nucleosome center inside —40 to +40 bp, and a decrease outside
of the region —40 to +40 bp (drop from 0.429 to 0.009 in —40 to
—70 bp and from 0.402 to 0.014 in +40 to +70 bp). Several pre-
vious studies (Thastrom et ai., 2004; Bohm et ai., 2011; van der
Heijden et ai., 2012) indicate that nucleosome positioning is
ﬁrst accessed by core histone (H37H4)2 tetramers, which occupy
~7(%80 bp surrounding the center, and the (H37H4)2 tetramers
dominate the free energy of histoneiDNA interaction. The high
change rate inside the region of —40 to +40bp, low change
rate outside of the region and symmetric pattern for the
central region of nucleosomal DNA (Fig. 2) strongly suggest
that the mechanism of nucleosome stability and dynamics is
mainly associated with the (H37H4)2 tetramer, rather than the
whole nucleosome, and the dinucleotide of AA/TT/AT/TA
could have more inﬂuence on the (H37H4)2 tetramer than H2A
or H2B.

Because NCS shows its better discriminatory ability on di-
nucleotide frequency patterns for nucleosomes with different
levels of scores in Figure 2 (P—Value < 2.2e-16), and the difference
in the central nucleosome region and outer region corresponds to
the previous studies, NCS is supported by known biological phe-
nomena. Moreover, based on the evidence that almost all PNs
are consistent with results of NCS (data not shown), we believe

high rate of change surrounding the center of the nucleosome, with a
decrease on both sides (drop is 0.42 in —40 to —70 bp and 0.39 in +40 to
+70 bp)

that results based on NCS are more accurate than NCP/noise
in regard to nucleosome preference for AA/TT/AT/TA, and
more details on the opposite condition will be discussed in
later sections.

3.2 N CS reveals the ﬂanking pattern on the preference of
AA/TT, AT and TA dinucleotides

We showed using NCS can successfully discriminate the patterns
of dinucleotide frequency for different nucleosome stabilities, and
provided the general result of the A/T-based dinucleotides on
nucleosomal DNA, to further investigate the preference of all
types of dinucleotides simultaneously on nucleosomal DNA and
across two neighboring regions. The frequency change rate for all
dinucleotide types is illustrated in Figure 3. As shown in Figure
3A, signiﬁcant ﬂanking was observed surrounding the position of
the central nucleosome on AA/TT, AT and TA, with a gentle bell
shape around the central nucleosome for other dinucleotide types,
such as C/G—based dinucleotides. Here, the frequency change rate
can be treated as the preference of dinucleotides for nucleosomes,
and according to the result shown in Figure 3A, AA/TT, AT and
TA, which are also abundant in the nucleosome-free region before
the TSS (Supplementary Fig. S7), can be regarded as nucleosome
unfavorable dinucleotides. The ﬂanking pattern appears to be
reasonable because it shows that the position for a stable nucleo-
some has less disfavored dinucleotides in the central nucleosomal
DNA region and more disfavored dinucleotides in the two outer
sides of the nucleosomal region, just like a trap to capture or drop
a nucleosome in the central region. This ﬂanking pattern agrees
with the deﬁnition of NCS because the nucleosome stability quan-
tiﬁed from NCS is achieved by measuring the shift of the nucleo-
some center, and the disfavored dinucleotide types on both outer
regions could theoretically limit the nucleosome from shifting.
Moreover, we also applied NCS on one previous study of nucleo-
some positions (Jiang and Pugh, 2009), and NCS shows the simi-
lar ﬂanking pattern and has a better result than the original study
as illustrated in Supplementary Figure S8. To our knowledge, no
existing study addresses the clear ﬂanking pattern on dinucleotide
preference for nucleosome stability until using NCS.

Based on nucleosome properties and the frequency pattern of
different dinucleotide types described in the Supplementary
Information, the nucleosomal region was partitioned into six
regions, and the average frequency change rate for each dinucleo-
tide and each region is shown in Figure 3B. We found that
different contributions of each dinucleotide type to nucleosome
stability and, for each dinucleotide, the extent of inﬂuence on
different nucleosome regions were not the same. Except for AA/
TT, AT and TA, which were dramatically reversed in the two
neighboring regions, the patterns of frequency change rate
mainly focused on the central region, and had only small
values close to 0 in the regions of two neighboring nucleosomes
(917236 and 2374100 bp). This fact also implies the efﬁciency of
NCS because the score scheme of NCS is for the central nucleo-
some, not for neighboring nucleosomes.

3.3 The negative relationship between NCS and
poly(dA:dT)

By NCS, we observed signiﬁcant patterns from A/T—based di-
nucleotides, and showed that AA/TT, AT and TA are disfavored
dinucleotide types for nucleosomes, contrary to the result by
NCP/noise. In fact, several previous studies have indicated that
poly-A/T tracts, referred to as poly(dA:dT), tend to disfavor
nucleosome formation (Field et ai., 2008; Segal and Widom,
2009a), associate with the nucleosome-free region (Wu and Li,

2010) and inﬂuence nucleosome organization and gene expres-
sion (Raveh-Sadka et ai., 2012). Therefore, we further showed
the relationship between NCS and poly(dA:dT) by classifying the
nucleosome data into 20 classes, based on ascending order of
NCS, and observing the amount of poly(dA:dT) for each class.
In Figure 4A, poly-A/T tracts with length 33 bp were detected to
calculate the ratio of poly(dA:dT) on nucleosomal DNA regions.
The poly(dA:dT) ratio decreased as the nucleosome stability
increased, indicating poly(dA:dT) as disfavored sequences for
nucleosomes, supporting previous results from the literature;
the differences between the ratio of the lowest and highest classes
are 7.24, 10.55 and 11.96% when the A/T switch becomes more
tolerant, showing that the effect of poly-A/T tracts with one or
two A/T switches is greater than that for pure poly(A) or poly(T)
on nucleosome stability. Furthermore, considering the different
sequence preferences of (H3+H4)2 tetramer and H2A+H2B
dimer, we divided the nucleosomal DNA region into inner and
outer parts, and the extent of poly(dA:dT) inﬂuence on nucleo-
some stability was different. As illustrated in Figure 4B, the
poly(dA:dT) ratio is more important for nucleosome stability
in the central nucleosomal DNA region than in the outer
region, stressing the effect of poly(dA:dT) on the central region
of nucleosomal DNA. This phenomenon implies that the central
nucleosome region mainly dominates its stability, consistent with
the result in Section 3.1. Moreover, this phenomenon, under
different A/T switches, can be observed in Figure 7, which
shows that the difference between two patterns of poly(dA:dT)
ratio separately from the central and outer regions becomes more
clear when including an A/T switch. This observation suggests
that the role of the AT or TA dinucleotide in the central region is
more important than in the outer region, consistent with
Supplementary Figure S9, which shows that the frequency of
the AT/TA dinucleotide is more considerable in the central
region than in the outer region.

Fig. 4. Brogaard’s data were classified into 20 classes based on the
ascending order of NCS. (A) The ratio of poly(dA:dT) on nucleosomal
DNA (the length of poly(dA:dT) 3 3 bp) and A/T switch means the time
of poly(A) changing to poly(T) or poly(T) changing to poly(A) that
poly(dA:dT) sequences can tolerate. (B) The poly(dA:dT) ratio with
A/T switch 2 2 on the central and outer nucleosomal regions

3.4 The opposite tendency between NCS and NCP/noise

Because we observed the opposite tendency on sequence prefer-
ence between NCS and NCP/noise score from Brogaard et al.’s
study, as stated in Section 3.1, we finally made a comparison
between them and discussed this issue. In Brogaard et al.’s
study, there are two kinds of scores: NCP measures the degree
of cleavages observed in positions that conform to two chemical
sites near the nucleosome center, and NCP/noise is a signal-to-
noise ratio filtering out background noise and is the main
nucleosome score used in their study (Brogaard et ai., 2012).
Therefore, the frequency change rates for nucleosomal DNA
under NCP/noise, NCP and noise are depicted in Figure 5. We
will discuss the NCP/noise score ﬁrst and leave discussion on the
other two for the next section. According to the pattern of NCP/
noise, the A/T-based dinucleotide preference in Figure 5A and
poly(dA:dT) preference in Supplementary Figure S10 both show
that strong nucleosomes favor A/T-based polynucleotides. Even
though this observation is contrary to the result of NCS and
previous studies, the expression of signiﬁcant periodic preference
for AA/TT in Figure 5A is not totally unreasonable because in
addition to support disfavoring poly(dA:dT) in the literature,
previous research found a preference for periodic dinucleotides
(Wang et ai., 2008), and an AA/TT dinucleotide for every 10 bp
makes DNA bend more favorably for nucleosomes (Prytkova
et ai., 2011). These two opposite phenomena have also been
indicated (Wal and Pugh, 2012) and may need more biological
experiments to unveil the connection between them.

Although the results of NCS and NCP/noise are opposite on
AA/TT/AT/TA dinucleotide preference, the relationship be-
tween these two score schemes is not simply negative because
the Spearman correlation of NCS and NCP/noise is 0.339, and
the distributions of nucleosome occupancy around TSS for NCS
and NCP/noise are similar. As illustrated in Figure 6, the results
of both score schemes support the barrier model, which means
that the +1 nucleosome forms a barrier, causing a uniform pos-
itioning that gradually decays in nucleosome positioning after-
ward (Mavrich et ai., 2008). However, the pattern based on NCS
more strongly supports the barrier model because the peaks of
+1 to +6 nucleosome occupancy decrease step by step.

3.5 Further analysis on Brogaard et al.’s score

Because the score of NCP/noise is composed of NCP and noise,
we further discussed these two score schemes and the interesting
results that we found, represented in Figure 5B and C. First, the
tendencies of AA/TT and AT/TA from the two schemes are
similar, which is against the general expectation about the
signal of noise, and means there could be sequence preference
or bias in the noise score. According to the authors of Brogaard
et al.’s study, low levels of non-specific chemical cleavages can be
observed due to unknown reasons. Consequently, the noise was
deﬁned to account for the background cleavages and was esti-
mated by the amount of cleavages in the neighboring region.
This implies that the score of noise is not only a pure measure
of background noise but could also include the nucleosome
occupancy or strength to some extent. We think that is the
reason why these two scores show similar preference for speciﬁc
dinucleotides. Second, the widespread disfavoring of AA/TT and
AT/TA is basically consistent with the result of NCS, and is
similar to the results from our source positioning data for NCS
in Supplementary Figure S11. This situation indicates that the
tendency based on NCS is not completely opposite of what was
observed in Brogaard et al.’s study, as the result of NCP/noise
suggests.

We further checked the poly(dA:dT) ratio for all score
schemes in Figure 7, and found that the value of noise is very
sensitive to the poly(dA:dT) ratio (the turning point in Class 1 is
possibly because the values of noise were all set to 0.5 when the
original scores <0.5). Because the values of noise actually mix
concepts of unknown background noise and nucleosome occu-
pancy, we presume the high sensitivity to poly(dA:dT) is a result

Fig. 6. The distribution of average nucleosome occupancies around the
TSS and TTS for NCS and NCP/noise shows that the patterns under the
two different score schemes are similar, but the NCS supports the model
of the +1 barrier nucleosome after the TSS to a greater degree

of these two factors, and that the unknown background noise
may have bias on A/T-based tracts. Moreover, the four-template
Poisson cluster model, which was used in Brogaard et al.’s study
to calculate nucleosome scores, shows there could be some
sequence preferences that affect the relative amount of primary
and secondary chemical cleavage sites near the nucleosome
center (Brogaard et ai., 2012).

According to the pattern of NCP and noise, and the slight
turning point for Class 1 in Figure 7, we think that the score
scheme of NCP was dominated to some extent by the score of
noise. In Supplementary Figure 812, the average nucleosome
occupancies around the TSS for NCP and noise show that the
peak of the original +1 barrier nucleosome is dramatically pulled
down compared with the +2 nucleosome, meaning that the
pattern of NCP was inﬂuenced by the pattern of noise.

4 CONCLUSION

The calculation of NCS is based on the incorporation of mass
raw sequencing data, and it provides reliability in measuring

NCS: quantify nucleosome stability

 

nucleosome stability. This is because using a unifying processing
method for all raw sequencing data can diminish the variance of
each positioning data, and combining different PNs can supple-
ment the insufﬁciency of single data. In this study, we applied
NCS on the precise nucleosome positioning data from Brogaard
et al.’s work. We then represented the efﬁciency of NCS based on
known sequence characteristics of nucleosomal DNA, and
showed the differences and possible limits of original Brogaard
et al.’s scores at the same time.

Based on NCS, a clear dinucleotide preference for stable nu-
cleosomes was illustrated, and signiﬁcant ﬂanking tendencies
around nucleosomal DNA were also revealed for the dinucleo-
tides AA/TT, AT and TA. The results of A/T-based dinucleotide
and poly(dA:dT) show that the degrees of sequence preference
for the central and outer regions of nucleosomal DNA are
different, which is basically due to the fact that core histone
(H3-H4)2 tetramers dominate the free energy of histone+DNA
interactions. In the comparison of NCS and Brogaard et al.’s
score, the pattern of NCS showed more reasonable behaviors
on the inﬂuence of central nucleosomal DNA regions, and dis-
favored the A/T tract across nucleosomal DNA, but we cannot
judge or find deﬁnite reasons to explain the behaviors of the
score from Brogaard et al.’s study. Nevertheless, some possible
assumptions based on observations of sequence characteristics
were provided in our study.

Because Brogaard et al.’s data support precise nucleosome
positions and NCS reliably reﬂects the nucleosome stability,
combing two data sources can enhance the future studies on
epigenetic regulation or nucleosome stability, which is affected
by several factors besides sequence preference. Moreover, we also
provide the data of original NCS for each base pair in the
Supplementary Data, so it will be easy to apply NCS to
genome-wide-related data, such as data of histone variant, site
of histone modiﬁcation or even transcriptional factor binding
site, to investigate the relationship with nucleosome stability.

Abstract

Motivation: A graphical representation of physicochemical and structural descriptors attributed to
amino acid residues occupying the same topological position in different, structurally aligned pro—
teins can provide a more intuitive way to associate possible functional implications to identified
variations in structural characteristics. This could be achieved by observing selected characteristics
of amino acids and of their corresponding nano environments, described by the numerical value of
matching descriptor. For this purpose, a web—based tool called multiple structure single parameter
(MSSP) was developed and here presented.

Results: MSSP produces a two—dimensional plot of a single protein descriptor for a number of
structurally aligned protein chains. From a total of 150 protein descriptors available in MSSP, se—
lected of >1500 parameters stored in the STING database, it is possible to create easily readable
and highly informative XY—plots, where X—axis contains the amino acid position in the multiple
structural alignment, and Y—axis contains the descriptor’s numerical values for each aligned struc—
ture. To illustrate one of possible MSSP contributions to the investigation of changes in physico—
chemical and structural properties of mutants, comparing them with the cognate wild—type struc—
ture, the oncogenic mutation of M918T in RET kinase is presented. The comparative analysis of
wild—type and mutant structures shows great changes in their electrostatic potential. These vari—
ations are easily depicted at the MSSP—generated XY—plot.

Availability and Implementation: The web server is freely available at http://www.cbi.cnptia.
embrapa.br/SMS/STINGm/MPA/index.html. Web server implemented in Perl, Java and JavaScript
and JMoI or Protein Viewer as structure visualizers.

1 Introduction

While sequence alignments are useful to detect mutations and con—
served amino acids, structural alignments are useful to investigate
conformational changes due to different reasons, such as mutations,
inhibition and allosteric changes. However, some functional differ—
ences between two or more similar protein structures may not be
identified and/or explained by using only this kind of information,
requiring instead some complementary methods.

In many studies, the overall effects on protein function, caused
by mutations, are not sufficiently understood, requiring some com—
plementary analysis of specific environments of amino acids residues
by means of observing changes in their physicochemical and struc—
tural properties. Based on that, we propose a web—based tool, which
can easily pinpoint changes in selected protein descriptors.

Multiple structure single parameter (MSSP) is a graphical tool
for visualizing the numerical value of a single, selected, protein de—
scriptor for a set of structurally aligned protein chains, allowing the
direct comparison of changes in that specific descriptor caused by
amino acid mutations, relative to the wild—type protein. However,
MSSP is not limited to compare only mutants—it can compare any
set of structurally similar protein chains.

2 Web server implementation

2.1 Overview
MSSP is a new module of STING server (Neshich et (11., 2005),
which using the protein descriptors available in STING server,

makes possible the graphical visualization of single protein descrip—
tor for an arbitrarily selected number of structurally aligned protein
chains.

STING server (version Blue Star) itself is a web—based platform
for a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between protein se—
quence, structure, function and stability. The STING server calcu—
lates and maintains a set of protein descriptors for all protein
structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; Berman et (11.,
2000). The server can also calculate descriptors for user—modeled
protein structures (www.cbi.cnptia.embrapa.br/SMS/JPD/tngelp.
htm), which may be then loaded in any of STING modules, includ—
ing MSSP. Two versions, MSSP applet (using JMol) and JS MSSP
(using Protein Viewer and JS JMol), are selectable.

2.2 Data input and display

MSSP accepts a list of PDB codes with their respective chain identi—
fiers and/or the STING TGZ files (generated by STING server for
user—modeled proteins). The structures could be globally aligned
using one of two available structural alignment software: A multiple
(protein) structural alignment algorithm (MUSTANG) (Konagurthu
et (11., 2006), and matching Models Obtained from Theory
(MAMMTH—mult), (Lupyan et (11., 2005), and the result can be
visualized in Jmol window (Fig. 1A). MUSTANG and Mammoth—
mult also provide the sequence alignment as a result of the generated
structural alignment, which is loaded in the Sequence Frame (Fig.
1B). MSSP then uses the sequence alignment to guide the plot gener—
ation, where it produces a two—dimensional (2D) line plot for the

plate). (A) Jmol window shows the structural alignment of selected protein chains. (B) Sequence frame shows the sequence alignment generated by MUSTANG,
obeying hierarchically higher structural alignment. (C) 2D line plot for protein chains selected at the input, showing chosen protein descriptor (in this case electro-
static potential at the protein surface) along the sequences studied. The matching positions are obtained by structural alignment, which allows direct comparison
of a single descriptor (Color version of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

selected descriptor, drawing the numerical values of the descriptor
on Y—axis (positioning the amino acid residue numbers in the se—
quence alignment on X—axis; Fig. 1C).

MSSP is freely available and does not require any installation or
registration; the only requirement is the java Rnntime Machine,
which is included in all modern web browsers.

2.3 Data export

The 2D plot can be exported as Scalable Vector Graphics, with
advantages that can be scaled without loss of quality and being
compatible with any modern web browser. It is also possible to ex—
port the contents (protein descriptors) as text, which then can be
analyzed with any external software (Fig. 1B, Supplementary
material).

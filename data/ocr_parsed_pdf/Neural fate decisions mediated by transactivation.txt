ABSTRACT

Motivation: In the developing nervous system, the expression of
proneural genes, i.e. Hes1, Neurogenin-2 (Ngn2) and Deltalike-1
(DI/1), oscillates in neural progenitors with a period of 2—3 h, but
is persistent in post-mitotic neurons. Unlike the synchronization
of segmentation clocks, oscillations in neural progenitors are
asynchronous between cells. It is known that Notch signaling, in
which Notch in a cell can be activated by Dll1 in neighboring
cells (trans-activation) and can also be inhibited by Dll1 within the
same cell (cis-inhibition), is important for neural fate decisions. There
have been extensive studies of trans-activation, but the operating
mechanisms and potential implications of cis-inhibition are less clear
and need to be further investigated.

Results: In this article, we present a computational model for
neural fate decisions based on intertwined dynamics with trans-
activation and cis-inhibition involving the Hes1, Notch and Dll1
proteins. In agreement with experimental observations, the model
predicts that both trans-activation and cis-inhibition play critical roles
in regulating the choice between remaining as a progenitor and
embarking on neural differentiation. In particular, trans-activation is
essential for generation of oscillations in neural progenitors, and cis-
inhibition is important for the asynchrony between adjacent cells,
indicating that the asynchronous oscillations in neural progenitors
depend on cooperation between trans-activation and cis-inhibition.
In contrast, cis-inhibition plays more critical roles in embarking on
neural differentiation by inactivating intercellular Notch signaling. The
model presented here might be a good candidate for providing the
first qualitative mechanism of neural fate decisions mediated by both
trans-activation and cis-inhibition.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the developing mammalian nervous system, it has been shown
that the expression of proneural genes, i.e. Hes1, NgnZ and D111,
oscillates in neural progenitors. However, in immature post-mitotic

neurons, Hes] is downregulated, but NgnZ and D111 are upregulated
in a sustained manner, suggesting that oscillatory versus sustained
expression of proneural genes is critical for neural fate decisions
(Kageyama et al., 2008; Shimojo et al., 2008). Additionally, Notch
signaling via intercellular communication also plays important roles
in neural fate decisions, i.e. activation of Notch signaling prevents
cells from differentiating and plays a crucial role in maintaining
neural progenitor populations during development (Matsuda and
Chitnis, 2009). Intercellular communication via Notch signaling
is involved in a wide variety of processes and generally controls
binary fate decisions between neighboring cells (Sprinzak et al.,
2010). Ligand—receptor trans-interactions, i.e. interactions between
neighboring cells, results in trans-activation and release of the
Notch intracellular domain. Ligand—receptor interactions also take
place within the same cell, i.e. cis-interaction, which induces the
inactivation of Notch by a process called cis-inhibition. Both
trans-activation and cis-inhibition have emerged as key regulatory
mechanisms in both vertebrates and invertebrates (del Alamo
et al., 2011). Trans-activation has been extensively investigated
both experimentally and theoretically, especially in the control of
vertebrate neurogenesis (Kageyama et al., 2008; Shimojo et al.,
2008) and somite formation (Ozbudak and Lewis, 2008; Uriu
et al., 2010a). In contrast, the operating mechanisms and potential
implications of cis-inhibition are less Clear and need to be further
investigated. Analyzing cell fate decisions based on both trans-
activation and cis-inhibition may have a broad impact on our
system-level understanding of Notch signaling and will be an
important topic for future exploration (Fiuza et (11., 2010).

Both oscillation and synchronization of Clock genes induced
by intercellular Notch signaling are necessary for normal
segmentation (Ozbudak and Lewis, 2008; Uriu et al., 2010a, b).
However, oscillations in neural progenitors are asynchronous
between neighboring cells. Progenitor cells tend to asynchronously
differentiate into diverse cell types so that they can respond
differently to the same environmental condition and thereby
contribute to generation of diversity in the developing brain
(Aulehla and Pourquie, 2008; Kageyama et al., 2009; Shimojo
et al., 2008). Both experiments and computational models have
shown that intercellular Notch signaling can successfully lead to
synchronized segmentation Clocks (Ozbudak and Lewis, 2008; Uriu
et (11., 2010a, b). However, synchronization cannot be realized,
despite the existence of intercellular Notch signaling, in neural
progenitors (Henrique et al., 1997). It has been speculated that

Neural fate decisions mediated by trans-activation and cis-inhibition

 

the stochastic nature of various biochemical processes can result
in loss of synchronization (Ozbudak and Lewis, 2008). However,
other studies show that stochasticity may play constructive roles
in producing synchronization (Chen et (11., 2005), and oscillators
with noise can still be synchronized (Garcia-Ojalvo et (11., 2004;
Horikawa et (11., 2006). Whether or not stochasticity is the main
reason for asynchrony has therefore still to be explored, and we need
to examine more carefully how synchrony and asynchrony between
neighboring cells can be realized by intercellular Notch signaling in
different developmental processes.

The purpose of this article is to present a computational model for
Notch signaling in neural progenitors based on intertwined dynamics
with cis-inhibition and trans-activation involving the Hes1, Notch
and D111 proteins. Not surprisingly, mathematical models of Notch
signaling, with different levels of sophistication, have been proposed
for virtually every organism for which sufﬁcient knowledge of
molecular biology exists [see e.g. Collier et (11. (1996); Sprinzak et (11.
(2010); Uriu et (11 . (2010a)]. All these models can produce sustained
oscillations but are not sufﬁcient in several important respects. First,
most of the previous models do not include an essential Characteristic
of Notch signaling, i.e. cis-inhibition (Collier et (11., 1996; Ozbudak
and Lewis, 2008; Uriu et (11., 2010a, b). Second, even when cis-
inhibition is incorporated, its link to proneural genes and its effects
on neural fate decisions have not been well considered (Sprinzak
et (11 ., 2010). Most models focus on how oscillations occur and how
synchronization is realized in somite patenting through intercellular
Notch signaling, but asynchrony in neural progenitors has not been
investigated theoretically. Thus, a new model is needed which
incorporates both cis-inhibition and trans-activation, and which can
account for their mechanisms, relevance and potential implications
in neural fate decisions.

In agreement with experimental observations, the model
presented here can account for both the asynchronous oscillations
observed in neural progenitors, and the persistency observed in
neurons, depending on cooperation between trans-activation and
cis-inhibition. Analysis of a two-cell system and an n-Cell system in
a 2D lattice uncovers a possible mechanism of neural fate decisions,
making the model a good candidate for providing the ﬁrst qualitative
example of neural fate decisions mediated by both trans-activation
and cis-inhibition.

2 THE MODEL

The model, which describes the regulatory processes between the
products of proneural genes, trans-activation and cis—inhibition in
neural progenitors, is schematized in Figure 1a. The expression
of proneural genes in neural progenitors oscillates asynchronously
between neighboring cells. Blockade of Notch signaling, a condition
known to induce neural differentiation, represses Hesl expression
and upregulates NgnZ and D111 expression persistently at higher
levels (Kageyama et (11., 2008). Notch signaling, in which Notch in
a cell can be cis-inhibited by D111 within the same cell, as well as
trans-activated by D111 in neighboring cells, as shown in Figure 1a,
thus integrating both cis- and trans-D111, as shown in Figure 10,
plays important roles in neural fate decisions.

Mathematical models of Notch signaling have previously been
proposed in insect neurogenesis (Collier et (11., 1996) and vertebrate
somitogenesis (Sprinzak et (11., 2010; Uriu et (11., 2010a), mainly
including the trans-activation process, but the operating mechanisms

and potential implications of cis-inhibition for neural fate decisions
are less Clear. The model presented here involves several aspects.
First, Notch of concentration N in cell i binds to extracellular D111
of concentration (Dj)l-, i.e. the average D111 level of all neighbors
j of 1', leading to release of the Notch intracellular domain S,
and degradation of its extracellular domain. Similarly, Notch in
neighboring cells, (NJ),- Can bind to D111. Second, Notch can also
bind to D111 within the same cell, causing inactivation of Notch.
Third, the Notch intracellular domain S induces expression of the
gene Hesl in the nucleus. Fourth, the protein Hesl represses the
transcription of its own gene Hesl and gene D111.

These regulatory processes can be expressed by a set of ordinary
differential equations for the concentrations of free Notch, Ni, free
D111, Di, the Notch intracellular domain, Si, Hesl mRNA, Mi, Hesl
protein in the cytoplasm, HC, ,- and Hesl protein in the nucleus, H NJ,

The degradation rates of all the components are assumed to obey
the Michaelis—Menten (MM) kinetics. The last term in Equation (2)
represents repression of D111 directly by Hesl and indirectly through
Ngn2, which is assumed to obey the MM kinetics. Equation (4)
means that the production of Hesl mRNA is negatively regulated
by Hesl in the nucleus and positively regulated by the Notch
intracellular domain S (Rodriguez-Gonzalez et (11 ., 2007; Uriu et (11.,
2010a, b). The translation from Hesl mRNA to the Hesl protein
in the cytoplasm and the transport of the Hesl protein from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus in Equations (5—6) are assumed to be
linear (Chen et (11., 2010). The notations (Dj)l- and (NJ),- refer to the
average D111 and Notch levels of all neighbors j of 1', respectively.
In particular,

where P is the connectivity matrix of a 2D lattice in which Pl-j is 1/6
if i and j are neighbors and 0 otherwise (Sprinzak et (11., 2010), as
shown in Figure 1b. The case of Neumann neighborhood in which
each cell has four nearest neighbors, as in Uriu et (11 . (2010b), can be
similarly discussed. Because of the high computational and memory
costs of simulating a system comprising many oscillators with six
variables each, only a very small lattice can be studied. To illustrate
the analysis, we only consider the case of two cells, i.e. n=2, as
in Lewis (2003); Uriu et (11. (2010a), except when asynchrony is
analyzed in Section 3.4, where a larger lattice with zero boundary
conditions, i.e. n: 14, will be Chosen, as shown in Figure lb. More
realistic cases, e.g. periodic boundary conditions, larger lattices or
even 3D lattices, can be similarly discussed.

Because the kinetic parameters are not reliably known from
experimental data, we adopt parameter values within the ranges
given in Sprinzak et (11. (2010) for the Notch signaling. While
for the Hesl autoregulation, we adopt parameter values used
in Uriu et (11. (2010a, b) except the basal transcription rate of
Hesl mRNA, v1. The range of v1 in Uriu et (11. (2010a) is
0.001—0.01 nM min_1 and the period of oscillations is ~25—35 min.
However, the period of oscillations in neural progenitors is ~2—3 h.
According to the parameter sensitivity analysis, we increase 111
to 0.15—1aninT1 so that the period of oscillations becomes
~2—3h because the period increases as 111 increases, as shown in
Figure 8b. In particular, the following parameter values are used
as standard values unless otherwise indicated: v1 = 1.0nM min—1,
v2 =0.2nM min—1, V3 =0.575 min—1, V4 =0.851 nM min—1,
v5 =0.021 min—1, v6=0.162anin_1, V7=10anin_1,
V3=20anin_1, V9=8.5anin_1, v10=10anin_1,
K1=0.157nM, K2=0.104nM, K4=0.142nM, K6=0.13nM,
Kd =2nM, K7 =2nM, K3 =4.72 nM, h=2, K9 =0.06 nM,
K10=10nM,n=2,kz=10.0nM_1min—1,kc=4.0nM_1min_1,
ﬂD=1anin_1, V6 :02 min_1 and 5N =10aninT1. The
deﬁnition of each parameter can be found in Supplementary Table
S1. The model will be evaluated to see how the Choice between
remaining as a progenitor and embarking on neural differentiation
is mediated by both trans-activation and cis-inhibition.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Notch signaling with both cis-inhibition and
trans-activation regulates neural fate decisions

It has been shown experimentally that cells can ectopically express
D111 or a dominant-negative derivative of D111, Dllld", thereby
activating or blocking Notch signaling (Austin et (11., 1995; Henrique
et (11., 1997). Normally, only the nascent neurons, scattered among
the dividing progenitors, express D111. When cells are forced
to express D111, neurogenesis is suppressed and all cells remain
as progenitors. Conversely, when cells are forced to express
Dllld", they differentiate prematurely as neurons and no dividing
progenitors remain. Notch signaling with both cis—inhibition and
trans-activation is therefore the mechanism that regulates the Choice
between remaining as a progenitor and embarking on differentiation.

The expression of Hesl oscillates in neural progenitors, but it
is persistent in post-mitotic neurons (Shimojo et (11., 2008). The
precise mechanism of the regulation of oscillatory versus persistent
Hesl expression remains to be determined. However, it is known
that inhibition of Notch signaling may induce neural differentiation.
To decide whether the model can account for such a phenomenon,
we may determine whether oscillations still occur when preventing
Notch signaling, by increasing the cis—inhibition strength kc or
decreasing the trans-activation strength k;. The bifurcation set in
a parameter space of k; and kc is shown in Figure 2a. Oscillations

inactivation of intercellular Notch signaling and further neural differentiation
with persistently low Hesl expression.

upper-left region, corresponding to the case of blocked intercellular
Notch signaling, as shown in Figure 2b. Such a phenomenon is
consistent with experimental observations that the expression of
Hesl is downregulated and that of D111 is upregulated in a sustained
manner in post-mitotic neurons, and no dividing progenitors remain
(Shimojo et (11., 2008). In contrast, in the lower-right region, where
efﬁcient intercellular Notch signaling can be realized, expression of
Hesl and D111 becomes oscillatory, corresponding to suppressed
neurogenesis, and all cells remain as progenitors. These results
explain why cells ectopically express D111 or Dllld", depending
on the need for activation or inhibition of the Notch signaling.
Both cis-inhibition and trans-activation therefore play critical roles
in regulating the Choice between remaining as a progenitor or
embarking on neural differentiation.

3.2 D111 regulates Notch signaling in a
concentration-dependent manner

Phenotypes of sustained Hesl expression and those of Notch
inactivation seem to be similar to each other, because each of them
induces neural differentiation. Hesl functions as both aregulator and
an effector of Notch signaling. In cells with persistently low Hesl
expression, Notch signaling is kept inactive, and thus the ﬁinction
of Hesl as an inhibitor seems to be dominant (Shimojo et (11.,
2008). However, low Hesl expression induces high D111 expression
because of the repression of the gene D111 by Hesl and ﬁirther
activation of Notch signaling via trans-activation. One possible
explanation for this contradiction is that the main ﬁinction of D111
at high concentrations is to cis-inhibit rather than to trans-activate
Notch signaling.

The biﬁircation set in a parameter space of V7 and kc is shown
in Figure 3b, which reﬂects the relationship between the repression
of D111 by Hesl and the cis-inhibition. For a larger V7, a smaller kc
is needed to produce persistently low Hesl expression. A larger V7
corresponds to higher D111 expression, and a smaller kc corresponds
to greater cis—inhibition strength. The main ﬁinction of high D111
expression induced by persistently low Hes1, in which Hesl acts as
an inhibitor to inactivate Notch signaling, is therefore to cis-inhibit
Notch signaling and thus induce neural differentiation. These results
are in agreement with the experimental observations, i.e. D111 can
exert an inhibitory effect on Notch signaling in a concentration-
dependent manner: high D111 expression induces the cis-inhibition
effect, whereas when lower D111 expression is present, only the
trans-activation effect is observed (Fiuza et (11 ., 2010; J acobsen et (11 .,
1998). In contrast, after activation of Notch signaling, oscillatory
Hesl expression seems to be induced as an effector. An increased
mean level of Hesl reduces mean D111 expression. Under such
conditions, only the trans-activation effect of D111 is observed.
These results indicate that Hesl can regulate neural fate decisions
by controlling D111; D111 can cis-inhibit or trans-activate Notch
signaling, depending on its concentration.

The bifurcation sets in a parameter space of k; versus kc at lower
V7, i.e. V7 =2nM min—1, and higher V7, i.e. V7 = 16 nM min—1, are
shown in Figure 3C and d, respectively. They have qualitatively
similar tendency, i.e. the larger kc becomes, the larger k; is needed
to generate oscillations, due to the opposite roles played by the
cis-inhibition and trans-activation, except that relatively larger k;
is needed to generate oscillations at relatively larger V7. These
results also indicate that the balance between cis—inhibition and

the V6 is needed to generate oscillations and Vice versa, which means
that two sources of oscillation can co-compensate the inefﬁciency of each
other to generate oscillations, showing that the oscillations of Hesl are
perhaps produced by combinatory regulation of negative autoregulation and
intercellular coupling. (b) A bifurcation set in a parameter space of V7 versus

trans-activation exists for both cases so as to regulate the fate
decisions.

3.3 Oscillatory versus persistent Hesl depends on both
cis-inhibition and trans-activation

Although Hesl is oscillatory in neural progenitors and persistent in
neurons, the precise mechanism of the regulation of persistent versus
oscillatory Hesl is not known. In other words, it is not Clear if Notch
signaling comprises a part of the oscillator mechanism or if Notch
signaling simply coordinates the activity of the oscillators between
neighboring cells. It has been shown that Notch signaling serves to
maintain synchrony in zebraﬁsh presomitic mesoderm (PSM) but
is not necessary for oscillations of individual cells (Ozbudak and
Lewis, 2008). In contrast to what happens in zebraﬁsh, elimination of
all Notch activity abolishes oscillatory gene expression and somite
formation in mouse PSM (Ferjentsik et (11., 2009). The different
roles that Notch signaling seems to play in mouse and zebraﬁsh
somitogenesis could be the result of different degrees of complexity
of the segmentation Clock mechanism in these two species.

The existence of intertwined negative autoregulation, intercellular
communication, and competition between trans-activation and
cis-inhibition raises the possibility that several mechanisms
are involved, independently or cooperatively, to produce the
oscillations. Negative autoregulation may generate oscillations. We
may determine whether oscillations still occur when intercellular
communication is prevented, i.e. by letting VC :0. Hesl signaling
has been extensively studied and several computational models
have been presented, in particular for the segmentation Clock (Uriu
et (11., 2010b). It has been shown that negative autoregulation with
delays (Lewis, 2003), interaction with Wnt and Notch signaling

(Rodriguez-Gonzalez et (11., 2007) or interaction with Jak-Stat
signaling (Shimojo et (11., 2008) can generate Hes1 oscillations.
The three-variable model for a single cell has the form of the
Goodwin oscillator (Goodwin, 1965), but uses the MM kinetics
for the degradation steps. Protein degradation is controlled by
phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and
thus it is reasonable to assume the MM kinetics. This model is Closely
related to those for the Circadian Clock in Neurospora (Leloup et (11.,
1999; Ruoff et (11., 2001) and can generate oscillations, as shown in
Figure 4a.

As well as negative autoregulation, intercellular Notch signaling
also forms an additional feedback loop, i.e. Notchl —> Hes11 -I
D1111 —> Notch; —> Hes1; -I D1112 —> Notchl, which is capable of
generating oscillations. The oscillation generated by intercellular
Notch signaling alone, i.e. eliminating direct autoregulation by
letting V1=0 and i=0 in Figure 4, is shown in Figure 4b.
Intercellular coupling-induced oscillations are also observed in the
delayed somitogenesis model (Lewis, 2003). Such multiple sources
of oscillations may reﬂect complex and often combinatory regulation
in Notch signaling.

When Notch signaling is inactive, Hes1 expression is persistent
in neurons, but active Notch signaling leads to oscillatory
Hes1 expression in neural progenitors, suggesting that the
oscillations depend on intercellular Notch signaling. Although either
negative autoregulation or intercellular coupling alone can generate
oscillations, they are not mutually exclusive and, in principle,
depend on each other. As shown in Figure 3a, the larger V1 becomes,
the smaller the VC needed to generate oscillations. Therefore, when
intercellular Notch signaling is insufﬁcient to produce oscillations,
negative autoregulation can compensate for the inefﬁciency and vice
versa. In other words, the existence of autoregulation reduces the
requirement of coupling strength for oscillations. The oscillations
of Hes1 are therefore perhaps produced by combinatory regulation

of negative autoregulation and intercellular coupling so as to make
the oscillations more robust against various perturbations.

Oscillatory or sustained Hes1 expression also depends on
cooperation between trans-activation and cis-inhibition. When the
cis-inhibition strength is increased (reduced kc), more Notch will
be cis-inhibited and less S can be released; thus, intercellular Notch
signaling will be blocked and oscillations will disappear. In other
words, increased cis-inhibition reduces the oscillation capability;
this facilitates the cessation of oscillations and embarkment on
neural differentiation. In contrast, increased trans-activation will
be helpful for generating oscillations and making cells remain as
progenitors. These results indicate that both trans-activation and
cis-inhibition play differential roles in neural fate decisions and
can account for the experimental observations, e.g. inhibition of
Notch signaling can induce neuronal differentiation (Austin et (11.,
1995; Matsuda and Chitnis, 2009) and Hes1 regulates neural fate
decisions via D111, which can either cis-inhibit or trans-activate
Notch signaling, depending on its concentration (Fiuza et (11.,
2010; Henrique et (11., 1997; Jacobsen et (11., 1998). These results
show that the interplay between trans-activation and cis-inhibition
can generate different states (Sprinzak et (11., 2010) and modulate
neurogenic signaling (Jacobsen et (11., 1998).

3.4 Cis-inhibition induces asynchrony between
adjacent cells

Synchronization of multicellular systems has been extensively
studied, e.g. coupled repressilators (Garcia-Ojalvo et (11., 2004),
Circadian oscillators (Gonze et (11., 2005) and segmentation Clocks
(Uriu et (11., 2010a, b). In contrast to synchronization of segmentation
Clocks, oscillations in neural progenitors are asynchronous among
cells (Aulehla and Pourquie, 2008; Kageyama et (11., 2009; Shimojo
et (11., 2008). A model by Lewis proposed a way by which DeltaC
synchronizes oscillations between neighboring cells (Lewis, 2003).
The model postulates that the intracellular oscillations of her]
and her7 genes are coupled to an intercellular oscillator involving
Delta ligands. In fact, Her1 and Her7 negatively regulate deltaC,
inﬂuencing Notch activity in the neighboring cells and ﬁnally their
own intracellular oscillations. This intercellular coupling mechanism
results in synchronization. Similar models based on trans-activation
have also been proposed for the synchronization of segmentation
Clocks (Uriu et (11., 2010a, b). Intercellular Notch signaling exists
in neural progenitors as well as in vertebrate somitogenesis. One
natural question then arises: why is intercellular Notch signaling
unable to induce synchronization in neural progenitors as it does in
somitogenesis?

It has been shown that segmentation Clocks based on trans-
activation can be easily synchronized (Lewis, 2003; Uriu et (11.,
2010a, b). In contrast, the model presented here incorporates
both trans-activation and cis-inhibition. When there is no cis-
inhibition or its strength is small, i.e. kc is large, the release of
the Notch intracellular domain S through trans-activation provides
a mechanism for intercellular coupling. Here, we just consider the
case of lattice structure with n = 14. When the coupling strength V6 is
large enough, synchronized oscillations can be observed, as shown
in Figure 5b. As the cis-inhibition strength is increased, more Notch
is cis-inhibited and less S is released. Finally, a sufﬁciently large
cis-inhibition strength induces loss of synchronization, as shown in
Figure 5a. To Characterize the transition to asynchrony, a quantity

Figure 5. In the unsynchronized regime, R << 1, whereas RR 1 in
the synchronized regime (Garcia-Ojalvo et (11., 2004; Gonze et (11.,
2005). The dependence of R on the cis—inhibition strength kc for two
different VC values is shown in Figure 6a. The results indicate that a
transition from a synchronized to an unsynchronized regime exists
as the cis—inhibition strength increases. Furthermore, the larger V6
is, the larger the asynchrony threshold, i.e. the smaller kc is, because
of their opposite effects in inducing asynchrony.

How asynchrony is realized is ﬁirther shown in Figure 6b.
Generally, synchronization is realized as the coupling strength
increases (Garcia-Ojalvo et (11., 2004; Gonze et (11., 2005).
However, for a sufﬁciently large cis-inhibition strength, e.g.
kc=4nM_1min_1, increasing V6 is not enough to induce
synchronization; this indicates that cis—inhibition plays a critical
role in regulating asynchrony. When we decrease the cis-inhibition
strength, e.g. kc=7 or 10nMT1min_1, increasing the coupling
strength can induce synchronization. Interestingly, if we further
increase the cis-inhibition strength, loss of synchronization can
be observed, as shown in Figure 6b. Such a phenomenon can
also be observed in Figure 6a. For a given coupling strength, e.g.
VC=0.SI]MII1111_1, a small enough cis-inhibition strength, e.g.
kc > 8 nM_1 min—1, cannot always achieve synchronization. There
are therefore at least two sources which can induce asynchrony
in neural progenitors: intermediate cis-inhibition and excessively
strong coupling strength. The ﬁrst mechanism is evident because
strong cis-inhibition causes less release of the Notch intracellular
domain S and insufﬁcient coupling, which induces loss of
synchronization. However, loss of synchronization can also be
observed when the coupling is too strong. The mechanism may
be that variations in V6 signiﬁcantly change the system dynamics
and thus make synchronization impossible; this needs to be further
studied. These results suggest that trans-activation is essential for
the generation of oscillations, and cis-inhibition is important for
asynchrony between oscillations, indicating that the asynchronous
oscillations in neural progenitors depend on cooperation between
trans-activation and cis-inhibition.

3.5 Parameter sensitivity analysis

Robustness characterizes the ability to maintain performance in
the face of perturbation of system parameters and is one of the
essential features of cellular systems (von Dassow et (11., 2000).
Parameter sensitivity analysis is a method frequently used to
quantify robustness. A higher sensitivity of a parameter implies
a lower robustness of the corresponding element. Two types of
sensitivity analysis are performed. One is the state sensitivity which
can be applied to steady regime. The other is period sensitivity and
can be applied to operating regime of oscillations.

To perform the state sensitivity, each parameter increased and
decreased its value 10% off its base value. The relative changes in
their steady states are shown in Figure 7. The simulations show that
the model in the steady regime is maintained over a relatively wide
range of parameter values. In fact, for some of the parameters, e.g.
13D and k7, the effect of perturbations is negligible, showing good
robustness of the system. These observations indicate that the most
important factors determining the differentiated state are Notch, as
indicated in its production rate 5N and degradation rate V9, and Hes1
mRNA, as indicated in its basal transcription rate V1 and degradation
rate V2. These observations highlight the central role of Notch and
autoregulation of Hes1 in determining the dynamics of the network.

How each parameter inﬂuences the period in the asynchronous
but oscillatory regime at the base parameter values is shown in
Figure 8. The most sensitive parameters are V1, V2 and K1, all of
which are related to the autoregulation of Hes1. The system is
very insensitive to perturbation of all other parameters, e.g. 5N,
as shown Figure 8a and other ﬁgures shown in the Supplementary

4 DISCUSSION

In contrast to the results of the substantial studies on trans-activation
between D111 and Notch, the operating mechanisms and potential
implications of cis-inhibition are less clear. In this article, we
present a computational model for neural fate decisions based
on intertwined dynamics with trans-activation and cis-inhibition
involving the Hes1, Notch and D111 proteins. The model predicts
that both trans-activation and cis-inhibition play critical roles in
neural fate decisions and therefore provides a good framework for
the theoretical analysis of the mechanisms underlying neural fate
decisions mediated by both trans-activation and cis—inhibition.

Consistent with known properties of the Notch signaling, the
model shows that: (i) inhibition of Notch signaling, e.g. by
cis-inhibition, can induce neuronal differentiation and (ii) Hes1
regulates neural fate decisions via D111, which can either cis-inhibit
or trans-activate Notch signaling, depending on its concentration.
In addition, the model makes a number of testable predictions:
(i) trans-activation is essential for the generation of oscillations
and cis-inhibition is critical for the asynchrony between them,
indicating that the asynchronous oscillations in neural progenitors
depend on cooperation between trans-activation and cis-inhibition;
(ii) in contrast, cis-inhibition plays more critical roles in embarking
on neural differentiation; and (iii) the mechanism producing the
oscillations may not be unique and the oscillations are perhaps
produced by combinatory regulation of negative autoregulation and
intercellular coupling so as to make the oscillations more robust
against various perturbations.

Several experiments can be performed to test the model
predictions. One of the principal predictions of the model is that
cis-inhibition is critical for the asynchrony between adjacent cells.
It might be detected by constructing cell lines which allows us to
modulate the concentrations of cis- and trans-D111 independently,
as in Sprinzak et (11. (2010), and then observing temporal pattern
of individual oscillations, as in Ozbudak and Lewis (2008), to
see if asynchrony can be realized when the concentration of cis-
D111 is high enough. Other predictions, e.g. the interplay between
trans-activation and cis-inhibition, can be similarly detected by
modulating the concentrations of cis- and trans-D111 independently.

Some other models proposed for the gene Hes1 assume explicit
time delays (Lewis, 2003). Similar to the model presented in Uriu
et (11. (2010a, b), we modeled the Hes1 protein in the cytoplasm and
the nucleus, and the model can generate oscillations without any
time delays. Ultradian oscillatory networks in neural progenitors
are probably more complicated. For example, Jak-Stat signaling
regulates Hes1 oscillations in neural progenitors (Shimojo et (11.,
2008). However, it is not clear if Notch signaling comprises a part
of the oscillator mechanism or simply coordinates the activities of
the oscillators among neighboring cells. The results here suggest that
multiple sources for oscillations are not mutually exclusive and, in
principle, may depend on each other. The existence of autoregulation
reduces the requirement for the coupling strength for oscillations
and vice versa; this indicates that Hes1 oscillations are perhaps
produced by combinatory regulation of negative autoregulation and
intercellular coupling so as to make the oscillations more robust
against various perturbations.

We have omitted some known components in the Hes1 circuit,
such as Ngn2 and Mashl . Although their contributions to neural fate
decisions may be important, at this stage, we are more conﬁdent
considering only Hes1 as the primary regulator of Notch. Other
components that are parts of the Hes1 circuit, such as Stat, which
negatively regulates Hes1 and is related to neural fate decisions
(Foshay and Gallicano, 2008), have not been included in our model
because detailed regulatory information is still scarce. Although the
model presented here is unlikely to be correct in all its details, it
provides a theoretical framework for understanding the neural fate
decisions mediated by both cis-inhibition and trans-activation.

The MM kinetics and different logic gates between components
are assumed due to a lack of information on detailed regulatory
processes. The model can be ﬁirther improved when more
information is available. We speculate that similar results can be

obtained when other kinetics and logic gates are used because
the network topology may play crucial roles in determining the
nonlinear dynamics, as in adaptations deﬁned by network topologies
(Ma et (11., 2009). It seems that the operating mechanisms and
biological implications uncovered by the model are also closely
related to the network topology. For example, cis-inhibition may
induce asynchrony simply because more Notch is cis-inhibited and
less Notch intracellular domain can be released, so insufﬁcient
coupling is induced; this mechanism is not constrained to detailed
parameter values. A concentration-dependent cis-inhibition process
can also be obtained from the network topology but not from detailed
parameter values. We therefore believe that our model captures the
main features of neural fate decisions mediated by both cis-inhibition
and trans-activation.

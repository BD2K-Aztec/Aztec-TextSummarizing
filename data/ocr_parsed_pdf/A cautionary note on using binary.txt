In this article, ‘A classification approach for DNA methylation
profiling with bisulfite next-generation sequencing data’ Cheng and
Zhu proposed a classification procedure based on a mixture of bino-
mial model to make binary calls for methylation status. Whereas we
find this approach interesting and competitive to method described
in Lister et a1. (2011) under the used assumptions, we advise to use
the proposed methodology with caution because we disagree with
some of the generalization made. Namely, the authors state that
Cytosine (C) positions can be either methylated or not and that
ideally after polymerase chain reaction amplification there are only
C or T reads for each covered C position of interest, depending on
the methylation status. In particular, it is stated that obtaining C
reads at unmethylated sites can be observed only due to incomplete
conversion, sequencing or other systematic errors.

Whereas true in many situations, these assumptions have impor-
tant exceptions. Methylation can indeed be described by a binary
variable when a single C in one DNA molecule is considered.
However, even in a single diploid cell all the autosomal chromo-
somes exist in two copies and at some loci methylation may occur at
one but not the other chromosome with imprinted loci being a well
recognized example (Adalsteinsson and Ferguson—Smith, 2014). The
heterogeneity of methylation at a given C can be even more promi-
nent when mixture of DNA molecules extracted from a population
of cells is studied (the most popular experimental design). In such
setting when many reads are obtained at a site (sequencing depth
higher than one), Cs in some DNA molecules can be methylated and
in some not generating a proportion which reflects a true biological
phenomenon rather than technical artifacts.

Using such proportions for prediction of phenotypic features, for
example age, has been widely described in the literature. In Hannum
et al. (2013) and Garagnani et al. (2012), a microarray-based meth-
ylation analysis shows that treating methylation as a continuous var-
iable is effective for identifying the correlation between subject age
and methylation. In Garagnani et al. (2012) proportions of methy-
lated Cs were used to predict age of 64 subjects and the ELO VLZ
gene showed a progressive increase in methylation with age with the
Spem‘man’s correlation coefficient equal to 0.92.

The dependence between age and methylation proportions for
the purpose of the age prediction is also the subject of our own stud-
ies. Using yet another technology (PyroMark platform) to analyse
full blood, we recently confirmed usefulness of ELO VLZ methyla-
tion as an age marker—the final linear regression model included
two Cs in ELO VLZ and enabled prediction with R2: 0.859 (Zbiec-
Piekarska at £11., 2014). Finally, we observed similar dependences
using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), a method
directly discussed by Cheng and Zhu. A plot of methylation fre-
quency against age for the ELO VLZ gene as obtained from RRBS
versus the methylation status calling (MSC) procedure described in
Cheng and Zhu (2014) is presented in Figure 1. Observe that in our
data, according to the MSC procedure, the position is ‘methylated’
if and only if the methylation frequency directly counted from RRBS
is greater than 0.45.

Incomplete conversion (for our data estimated as ~O.3%),
sequencing and systematic errors cannot be responsible for these
findings reported in several studies using different methods. Thus,
we would like to argue that making binary calls as proposed in

ELOVL2 C (position 11044867, chromosome 6) as obtained directly
from RRBS versus the MSC procedure. Each data point illustrates meth»

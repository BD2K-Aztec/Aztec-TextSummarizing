ABSTRACT

Motivation: Next-generation sequencing and other high-throughput
technology advances have promoted great interest in detecting asso-
ciations between complex traits and genetic variants. Phenotype
selection, quality control (QC) and control of confounders are crucial
and can have a great impact on the ability to detect associations.
Although there are programs to perform association analyses,
e.g. PLINK and GenABEL, they cannot be used for comprehensive
management and QC of phenotype data. To address this need
PhenoMan was developed: to select individuals based on multiple
phenotype criteria or population membership; control for missing cov-
ariate data; remove related individuals, duplicate samples and individ-
uals with incorrect sex specification; recode primary traits and
covariates; transform data; remove or winsorize outliers; select cov-
ariates for analysis; and create residuals. To ensure consistency and
harmonization between analyses, a report is generated for every data-
set. Summary statistics are also provided in graphical or text format.
PhenoMan can be used for selection and manipulation of quantitative,
disease and control data.

Summary: Phenoman is freeware that provides approaches for
efficient exploration and management of phenotype data. Proper QC
of phenotypes before proceeding to the association analysis is critical
to ensure control of type | and II errors, reliable effect estimates and
consistent results between studies. PhenoMan is highly beneficial for
the preparation of qualitative and quantitative trait data for association
studies using new datasets as well as those obtained from public
repositories.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, next-generation sequencing technologies have
generated vast amounts of exome and genome sequence data
to be used for the detection of complex trait associations.
Although association analyses play a crucial role in elucidating
the genetic etiology of complex traits, type I error can be
increased and power may be profoundly weakened by pheno-
typic outliers, related individuals, missing phenotypic values,

population stratification, inclusion or exclusion of covariates to
control for confounders and so forth (de Bakker et al., 2008).
Additionally, often between studies analysis of phenotypes are
not consistent, e.g. phenotype selection, inclusion of covariates,
treatment of outliers. It is important that all analysis steps
e.g. determining which study subjects and covariates to include
in the analysis are fully documented, so results are reproducible
and additionally analyses are consistent between datasets, which
is a key for both meta-analysis and replication studies (Chang
et al., 2006). Although programs such as PLINK (Purcell et al.,
2007) and GenABEL (Aulchenko et al., 2007) can be used for
association analysis, they cannot be used for comprehensive
management and quality control (QC) of phenotype data.
Additionally, R (www.r-project.org) could be used for data
exploration, but it is not readily suitable to perform all necessary
tasks to prepare phenotype data for association analysis; add-
itionally the user must have expertise in writing R scripts. The
PhenoMan software was developed to provide a universally
powerful framework with simple commands, to integrate both
quantitative and qualitative phenotype data exploration, QC and
sample selection into a unified program. PhenoMan, an inter-
active command-line driven program, is written in Python
and R.

2 DESCRIPTION

2.1 Sample selection

PhenoMan can select study subjects not only based on a single
trait but also using any phenotypic information of interest. For
both case-control and quantitative traits, individuals can be
selected according to multiple qualitative and quantitative
phenotypic attributes and inclusion and exclusion criteria,
e.g. type 2 diabetes status, age, body mass index, lipid profiles
and so forth. These criteria can also be used to deﬁne case-
control status. Selection can also be made using extremes for
one or more quantitative traits.

2.2 Removal of individuals

If genotype or sequence data are available, samples can be
selected for removal if their reported sex is inconsistent with
genetic data, they are a cryptic duplicate or related to another
study subject or they belong to a population other than the one
understudy. Genetic association analyses are usually performed

separately for each population, e. g. Europeans and Asians.
Although self-reported race information is usually available,
these data are not always reliable. PhenoMan uses components
from multidimensionality scaling to determine population mem-
bership and can eliminate those individuals who belong to other
ethnic groups, e.g. for a study of African-Americans remove
European-American individuals.

2.3 Recoding of variables

PhenoMan can be used to recode phenotype information, e.g.
to dichotomize quantitative traits/covariates and to perform
dummy coding of covariates that are not ordinal, e. g. medication
usage. Also information from multiple covariates can be com-
bined, e. g. waist and hip measurements can be used to determine
hip-to-waist ratios. Additionally missing values can be substi-
tuted with the average trait value.

2.4 Transformation of quantitative traits and handling
of outliers

PhenoMan can perform various types of data transformation on
quantitative traits, including log, scaling, standardization, nor-
malization and Gaussian quantile normalization. PhenoMan can
be used to detect quantitative trait outliers by Visualization of the
density and with statistics such as range, mean, median and
standard deviation. Identiﬁed outliers can be either removed or
winsorized. Usually values that are not biologically feasible
are removed because they are likely an error, whereas all other
outliers are winsorized.

2.5 Selection of covariates

Potential confounding factors should be controlled for in the
analysis (Stitziel et al., 2011). PhenoMan can aid in the selection
of covariates, which are potential confounders by performing
either forward or backward selection or using Akaike informa-
tion criterion. For quantitative and case-control data, these cov-
ariates can be included in the regression model. For quantitative
traits, it is also possible to use PhenoMan to obtain residuals that
can then be analyzed.

2.6 Data summary and outputs

PhenoMan generates a new phenotype ﬁle containing only those
individuals that were selected for analysis and the desired covari-
ates. PhenoMan also generates a summary file that contains stat-
istics on the selected traits and covariates, e.g. mean, median
and standard deviation, number of females, percent of missing
values. This summary information can also be generated as
graphical output.

2.7 PhenoMan workﬂow

To prepare phenotypic data for analysis, we suggest using the
workﬂow shown in Figure l.

2.8 Software overview/functionality

PhenoMan consists of a large variety of modules to handle most
phenotype manipulation, testing and cleaning related tasks.
PhenoMan uses and outputs standard format text files that are

also used by dbGaP (Mailman et al., 2007) and PLINK. On
completion of the phenotype data exploration, selection and
QC, PhenoMan can create a checklist/workﬂow of all critical
decision points by saving executed commands and arguments.
This checklist can be used to reproduce results and also to
ensure analysis is comparable between studies. Additionally,
for ease of use relevant commands can be extracted for the
analysis of additional datasets.

3 DISCUSSION

For association studies, QC can be time-consuming, but it is
necessary before the onset of data analysis. Proper QC of pheno-
types before proceeding to association analysis is critical to
ensure control of type I and II errors, reliable effect estimates
and consistent results between studies. PhenoMan is designed to
provide a convenient and comparable manner to obtain analysis-
ready phenotype data. Performing this important process
contains two steps: (i) explorationiuse statistics and graphics
to overview the data and (ii) solutions%orrect/transfom, select
and/0r remove identiﬁed ‘erroneous’ entities. Ultimately, we
expect that PhenoMan will enhance the analysis of association
data.

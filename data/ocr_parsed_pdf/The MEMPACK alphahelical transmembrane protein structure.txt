ABSTRACT

Motivation: The experimental difficulties of alpha-helical
transmembrane protein structure determination make this class of
protein an important target for sequence-based structure prediction
tools. The MEMPACK prediction server allows users to submit
a transmembrane protein sequence and returns transmembrane
topology, lipid exposure, residue contacts, helix—helix interactions
and helical packing arrangement predictions in both plain text and
graphical formats using a number of novel machine learning-based
algorithms.

Availability: The server can be accessed as a new component of
the PSIPRED portal by at http://bioinf.cs.uc|.ac.uk/psipred/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Given the biological and pharmacological importance of
transmembrane (TM) proteins and the difﬁculties associated
with obtaining their crystal structures, the use of bioinformatics
approaches to direct experimental work while furthering our
understanding of their structure and function is essential. The
MEMPACK prediction server applies a selection of machine
learning-based tools to predict TM topology—the total number
of TM helices, their boundaries and in/out orientation relative
to the membrane—with the addition of lipid exposure, residue
contacts, helix—helix interactions, culminating in prediction of
the optimal helical packing arrangement using a force-directed
algorithm. Figure 1 provides an example of some of the server
output. The underlying tools have recently been shown to provide
signiﬁcant improvements in prediction accuracy compared with
existing methods. It is hoped that this service will be of beneﬁt to
the broader scientiﬁc community.

2 METHODS

In order to predict TM protein topology. the server employs the MEMSAT3
(Jones. 2007) and MEMSAT-SVM (Nugent and Jones. 2009a) methods
which are based on neural network and SVM classiﬁers. respectively.
Both methods use a dynamic programming algorithm to return a list of

families. The methods were trained using PSI-BLAST (Altschul at al.. 1997)

MEMSAT—SVM. and achieved maximum topology prediction accuracies of
78% (Moller set) and 89% (crystal structure set) when fully cross-validated
using a jack knife test. The higher fraction of eukaryotic sequences in the
Moller set compared with the relative bias toward prokaryotic sequences
in the crystal structure set suggest that the strong performance of these two
methods makes their combination ideally suited to whole-genome annotation
of alpha-helical TM proteins.

3 PREDICTION OF THE OPTIMAL HELICAL
PACKING ARRANGEMENT

Despite signiﬁcant efforts to predict TM protein topology,
comparatively little attention has been directed toward developing a
method to help users determine possible 3D packing arrangements
for helices. Our novel tool MEMPACK (Nugent and Jones, 2009b)
uses a range of features to predict residue contacts and helix—helix
interactions before using this information to predict the optimal
helical packing arrangement. First, an SVM classiﬁer, trained using
lipid exposed residue proﬁles labelled according to molecular
dynamics simulation data (Sansom et (11., 2008), is used to predict
per residue lipid exposure. This information is then combined with
PSI-BLAST proﬁle data for each interacting residue and additional
sequence-based features as input data for an SVM to predict
residue contacts. Combining these results with predicted topology
information, helix—helix interactions can then be predicted and used
to optimally arrange the helices using a graph-based approach.
By employing a force-directed algorithm, the method attempts to
minimize edge crossing while maintaining uniform edge length,
attributes common in native structures. Finally, a genetic algorithm
is used to rotate helices in order to prevent residue contacts occurring
across the longitudinal helix axis. Under stringent cross-validation
on a non-redundant test set of 74 protein chains, the method
achieved 70% lipid exposure and 67% helix—helix interaction
prediction accuracy—both signiﬁcant improvements over existing
methods—and was able to produce a helical packing arrangement
which closely resembled a 2D slice taken from the crystal structure
approximately normal to the likely plane of the lipid bilayer in 14

show the raw scores generated by the SVMs that distinguish between TM

reentrant loops or non-reentrant loops (RE/IRE) and signal peptides or
non-signal peptides (SP/lSP). Colors in the MEMPACK cartoon indicate
hydrophobic residues (blue), polar residues (red) and charged residues (green
for negative, purple for positive). Lines between residues indicate a predicted

predicted. Of the remaining 51 cases, 34 were partially predicted
while 17 had no predicted interactions, highlighting the challenges
that remain for helix—helix interaction prediction in TM proteins.

Abstract

Summary: Gene transcription is mostly conducted through interactions of various transcription
factors and their binding sites on DNA (regulatory elements, REs). Today, we are still far from
understanding the real regulatory content of promoter regions. Computer methods for identifica—
tion of REs remain a widely used tool for studying and understanding transcriptional regulation
mechanisms. The Nsite, NsiteH and NsiteIl/I programs perform searches for statistically significant
(non—random) motifs of known human, animal and plant one—box and composite REs in a single
genomic sequence, in a pair of aligned homologous sequences and in a set of functionally related
sequences, respectively.

1 Introduction

Transcription regulatory elements (REs) bound by transcription fac-
tors (TFs) are main players in gene expression (Grunberg and Hahn,
2013). Although a large set of experimentally identified REs/TFs has
been collected in several databases (Ramirez and Basu, 2009;
Solovyev et (11., 2010), the real RE content of promoters of most
genes remains unidentified.

Established computational RE identification algorithms are predom-
inantly based on one of two approaches: (i) the search for motifs of
known REs or (ii) the comparative analysis of homologous sequences
aimed to discover new REs (Ladunga, 2010; Solovyev et (11., 2010). The
first type of methods uses regulatory site and/or IUPAC consensus se-
quences or position-weight matrices. One of challenges in RE detection
is to estimate the statistical significance of located motifs to distinguish
them from random matches. In addition, in some cases, TFs bind a
composite RE (a pair of DNA motifs with a spacer sequence of variable
length between them) rather than a single short DNA region.

Here, we present Nsite, NsiteH and NsiteM, a set of programs to
predict both single and composite REs in query sequences and esti-
mate their statistical significance.

2 Results

Previously, we proposed a probabilistic model that computes the prob-
ability of observing given sequence motifs or consensuses in random nu-
cleotide sequences of the same length and nucleotide frequencies as a
query sequence. The model also estimates the expected number of such
motifs in random sequences. In particular, the model assumes that be-
cause REs are small that numbers rather than frequencies of nucleotides
should be used to describe RE consensus sequences (Shakhmuradov
et (11., 1986; Solovyev et (11., 2010; see also Supplementary Material S4).
These statistical estimations provide the opportunity to find non-ran-
dom similarities (unlikely to have occurred by chance) between a set of
functional motifs and regions of an analyzed sequence. By applying this
approach, we developed the Nsite, NsiteH and NsiteM computer

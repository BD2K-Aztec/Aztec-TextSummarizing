Abstract

Motivation: Automated screening approaches are able to rapidly identify a set of small molecules
inducing a desired phenotype from large small—molecule libraries. However, the resulting set of
candidate molecules is usually very diverse pharmacologically, thus little insight on the shared
mechanism of action (MoA) underlying their efficacy can be gained.

Results: We introduce a computational method (Drug—Set Enrichment Analysis—DSEA) based on
drug—induced gene expression profiles, which is able to identify the molecular pathways that are
targeted by most of the drugs in the set. By diluting drug—specific effects unrelated to the pheno—
type of interest, DSEA is able to highlight phenotype—specific pathways, thus helping to formulate
hypotheses on the MoA shared by the drugs in the set. We validated the method by analysing five
different drug—sets related to well—known pharmacological classes. We then applied DSEA to iden—
tify the MoA shared by drugs known to be partially effective in rescuing mutant cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene function in Cystic Fibrosis.

Availability and implementation: The method is implemented as an online web tool publicly avail—

1 Introduction

Large collections of small—molecules can be automatically screened
against a desired phenotypic effect. Automated experimental screen—
ing approaches include high—content screening (HCS) (Bickle, 2010)
and high—throughput screening (HTS) (Bajorath, 2002), with differ—
ent advantages and limitations, and a screening capacity that ranges
from thousands to millions of compounds per assay.

Screening assays can be performed either to identify lead com—
pounds binding a specific molecular target, or inducing a specific
phenotype of interest. A common drawback of automated molecular
screening is the opacity of the hit compound selection mechanism.
Indeed, the set of positive hits following an HTS or HCS typically in—
cludes small—molecules with unknown mode—of—action (MoA) or
whose MoA are so different from each other, that no hint on the

shared molecular mechanisms underlying their efficacy can be
gained (Sams—Dodd, 2005).

The difficulty in characterizing a set of screening hits resides in the
complexity of their interactions within the cell. Molecules binding the
same molecular target can induce different phenotypes caused by un—
known off—targets. On the contrary, molecules binding different targets
can induce the same phenotype, when they act in the same pathway
(Sams—Dodd, 2005). Nonetheless, among the heterogeneous effects
induced by the hit compounds in the cell, there could exist a common
mechanism responsible for their efficacy in the screening selection.

Here, we introduce a new method, named drug—set Enrichment
Analysis (DSEA), that aims at identifying the mechanism(s) of action
shared by a set of compounds in terms of the molecular pathways
targeted by all, or most of them.

We define a pathway as a set of genes. We collected a large data—
base of pathways by merging nine different publicly available collec—
tions, including generic gene sets (co—localized genes, co—regulated
genes, protein complex subunits, etc.) and disease—related gene sets.

DSEA looks for shared pathways in a set of drugs by analysing
transcriptional responses induced by each of the compounds of
interest in one or more cell lines. To this end, we exploited the
Connectivity Map (cMap, Lamb et al., 2006) dataset consisting of
about 7000 microarrays following treatment of four different cell
lines with 1309 drugs.

The main hypothesis underlying DSEA is that if pharmacologic—
ally different drugs induce the same phenotype of interest, then
some of the molecular pathways they target must be shared by most
of them. Although this is not necessarily true in general, it is a rea—
sonable assumption. DSEA is designed to search transcriptional re—
sponses of different, but phenotypically—related, drugs for shared
pathways whose genes are upregulated (or downregulated) by most
of the drugs in the set. In this way, pathways relevant for the pheno—
type of interest should emerge, while drug—specific pathways, which
are unrelated to the phenotype of interest, should cancel out.

To validate the method, we thoroughly tested the ability of
DSEA in identifying the shared pathways for five different drug—sets
whose MoA has already been well characterized: Histone
Deacetylase Inhibitors (HDIs), Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitors
(CDKIs), Heat Shock Protein 90 Inhibitors (HSP9OIs),
Topoisomerase Inhibitors (TIs), Cardiac Glycosides (CGs). Finally,
we applied DSEA to a set of eleven drugs, belonging to different
pharmacological classes, that have been shown to act as (weak) cor—
rectors of the mutant CFTR protein defect (AF508) causative of cys—
tic fibrosis.

2 Methods

2.1 Data preparation

We downloaded raw data files from the cMap (Lamb et al., 2006), a
compendium of 7056 Affymetrix microarrays (.CEL files) obtained
with three different chipsets (HG—U133A, HT_HG—U133A,
HT_HG—U133A_EA). Expression values for all the samples were
computed using the R package affy v.1.40.0 (Gautier et al., 2004)
with MAS5 normalization. The probes of each chipset were re—anno—
tated to 12 012 genes using the Brainarray CDF packages v.16.0.0
(Dai et al., 2005). The combined matrix (12 012 X 7056), after
removing non—common (control) probes, was quantile—normalized
(see Fig. 1a). Fold change (FC) values were obtained as log—ratios

between the values of the treatment samples and the corresponding
control samples (averaged over replicates) thus reducing the data
matrix to size 12012 X 6100. After converting FC values to ranks,
we built Prototype Ranked Lists (PRLs) by merging all the samples
corresponding to the same drug, as described in Iorio et al. (2010),
thus obtaining a 12 012 genes X 1309 drugs matrix of PRLs (see
Fig. lb).

2.2 A Pathway—based connectivity map

We collected set of genes (pathways) from nine publicly available
databases (see Table 1): Biological Processes (GO—BP), Molecular
Function (GO—MF) and Cellular Component (GO—CC) from
BioMart (Durinck et al., 2009), excluding pathways with less than 5
or more than 500 genes, KEGG, Reactome, Biocarta, Canonical
Pathways, Genetic and Chemical Perturbation (as collected in
MSigDB, Subramanian et al., 2005) and MIPS Corum (Ruepp et al.,
2010). For each gene set, we removed the genes not included in the
set of 12012 Affymetrix probe—mapped genes. In addition, we
defined a gene—based collection (Single—Gene Sets, SGS) by building
12 012 fictitious gene sets containing only one gene. We provided
this addition database just as a resource for the user who wishes to
perform DSEA analysis in a gene—wise fashion, although we discour—
age its use being DSEA designed to work with gene—sets rather than
single genes. To convert the 12 012 genes X 1309 drugs PRL matrix
to a pathway—oriented matrix, we proceeded as follows: given a
pathway database of interest, for each pathway 1' in the database,
and each PRL /, we computed a signed Enrichment Score ES,-,- and a
p—value using the Kolmogorov—Smirnov (KS) test (Subramanian et
al., 2005 ). The two—sample KS statistic is defined as the maximum
distance between two empirical distribution functions. Along the
lines of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis method (GSEA,
Subramanian et al., 2005), we apply a signed version of the KS stat—
istic to compare gene ranks. The ES associated with the KS statistic
is thus defined as follows:

EstuplF1 —F2I '$(F1,F2) (1)

where F1 and F2 are the two empirical distribution functions corres—
ponding to the ranks of the genes included in a set of interest (F1)
against those that are not included (F2), and s is a function returning —
1 or + 1 according to the sign of F1 — F2 at the point where their ab—
solute difference is maximal. Note that a P—value for the KS test can
be computed analytically without resorting to random permutations.
In particular, we used our signed variant (available online at https://
github.com/franapoli/signed—ks—test) of the R function ks. test to

compute the signed KS statistic (and the corresponding p—values, used
in the next Subsection). We thus obtained, for each database, one
Enrichment Score matrix ES whose rows correspond to pathways and
whose columns correspond to drugs (see Fig. 1c).

In the rest of the paper, we will make two other different uses of
the KS test: to compute the DSEA itself in Section 2.3, and to valid—
ate it in Section 3.2.

2.3 Drug—set enrichment analysis

DSEA quantifies the extent at which a set of drugs consistently upre—
gulates (or downregulates) one or more pathways. Starting from the
ES matrix, we first sorted each row 1' according to the Enrichment
Scores ES,,- of the pathway 1' across the/ : 1 . . . 1 drugs (see Fig. 1d),
obtaining a rank—based matrix R. Each element R,,- in R represents
the rank of drug / when sorting drugs according to their effect on
pathway 1'. The significance of a drug—set for each pathway is as—
sessed by applying the same procedure showed previously to com—
pute the ES,-,- scores, but comparing drug ranks (distributed across
the row corresponding to a given pathway) as opposed to gene ranks
(distributed across the column corresponding to a given drug). In
this case, the sign of the ES indicates whether a pathway is activated
or inhibited by the drugs in the set.

DSEA can be thought of as the dual of GSEA: if in GSEA a drug—
induced expression profiles can be represented as a ranked list of dif—
ferentially expressed genes, in DSEA we modeled a pathway as a
ranked list of drugs.

From a methodological point of view, DSEA is able to highlight
pathways that are significantly modulated by most of the drugs in
the input drug—set relative to the other drugs in the database. This
means that if drugs in a drug—set tend to modulate the same pathway
more than the other drugs in the database, this pathway will be
found by DSEA, even if the modulation exerted by the single drugs
on the pathway is weak. This mechanism is key to identify a shared
mode of action, even when it is not apparent when considering the
individual drugs in the set.

3 Results

3.1 Drug—set enrichment analysis (DSEA)

We developed the Drug—Set Enrichment Analysis (DSEA) algorithm
in order to identify the shared molecular pathways modulated by
all, or most of, the compounds in a given set.

DSEA exploits a compendium (the cMap, Lamb et al., 2006) of
Gene Expression Profiles (GEPs) following treatment with 1309 small
molecules (mostly FDA approved drugs). DSEA works by applying
the following steps: (i) Figure 1a,b—GEPs for each small molecule are

Fig. 2. The DSEA method. Pathways are defined as ranked lists of drugs.
DSEA performs a statistical test to assess whether the drugs in a set are sig-
nificantly ranked at top (or bottom) of the row corresponding to a given path-
way. Each row is ranked according to how much the drug in the column
upregualtes (or downregulates) the genes in the pathway. The toy example
shows how a set of three drugs is found to consistently downregulate one
pathway (top arrow), while upregulating another one (bottom arrow)

merged into ranked lists of differentially expressed genes (following
treatment of multiple cell—lines and at different dosages) into a unique
Prototype Ranked List (PRL, Iorio et al., 2010); (ii) Figure 1c—each
gene—wise PRL is converted to a pathway—wise PRL, by computing the
Enrichment Score (ES) of each pathway through a GSEA approach
(see Section 2), using the list of genes in the pathway as the gene—set,
and the gene—wise PRL as the ranked list of genes. (Subramanian et
al., 2005). Each pathway thus has a specific ES for each small—mol—
ecule; (iii) Figure 1d—the resulting pathway—by—small—molecule ma—
trix is then sorted row—wise, so that each pathway is now associated
to a ranked list of small—molecules: from the one most activating the
pathway to the one most inhibiting it.

Given a query—set of small—molecules, DSEA checks for each path—
way whether small—molecules tend to be significantly ranked at the
top (or the bottom) of the list, by applying a Kolmogorov—Smirnov
(KS) test, as shown in Figure 2. An Enrichment Score for the drug—set
and a p—value can thus be computed for each pathway exactly, with—
out the need of random permutations. The final output of DSEA is a
list of pathways ranked by the KS P—value, which are significantly
modulated by the majority of the small—molecules in the drug—set.

3.2 Validation

To validate the method, we applied DSEA to five drug—sets consist—
ing of compounds belonging to five distinct pharmacological classes,
as summarized in Table 2. Prior knowledge about each drug—set
allowed us to assess whether the shared pathways found by DSEA
within each class were correct.

The P-values assess if the golden-standard pathways within the GO-BP,
GO-MF and GO-CC databases are ranked signiﬁcantly at the top by DSEA.
P-values < 0.005 are highlighted in bold.

To this end, we defined a golden standard for each drug—set as
follows: we selected the known target gene for each drug—set (see
Table 2). For drugs with more than one known target, we chose the
first member (alphabetical order) of the target protein family. In the
case of Topoisomerase Inhibitor (TI) drug—set, we chose TOP2 be—
cause six out of nine drugs in the set were TOP2 inhibitors. For the
Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor (HDI) drug—set, we chose HAT1 in
addition to HDAC1.

For each drug—set, we then added to the golden—standard all the
Gene Ontology (GO) pathways containing the chosen drug target. A
summary of the golden standard for each drug—set is reported in
Suppl. Table S1.

To evaluate the performance of DSEA, we checked whether the
golden—standard pathways were significantly enriched at the top of
the ranked list of pathways given as output by DSEA by applying
again a KS test.

As shown in Table 3, for each drug—set, DSEA ranked the
golden—standard pathways significantly at least in one GO database.
Suppl. Table S3 shows the same type of validation for each of the 10
pathway databases.

Interestingly for the HDI drug—set, when using HDAC1 as the
target gene for the golden standard pathways, we did not find any
significant enrichment, however when using the dual enzyme,
HAT1, we did find the golden standard pathways to be significantly
shared by the drugs in the drug—set (Table 3). These pathways are
related to the process complementary to deacetylation, that is acetyl—
ation. The acetylation—deacetylation balance is known as acetylation
homeostasis and the existence of a HAT—HDAC coupling through a
common signal has been suggested (Dokmanovic et al., 2007).

In order to exclude that the results obtained in Table 3 were due
to a hidden bias in the golden standard pathways, we generated for
each of the 5 drug—sets, 1000 random drug—sets with the same size as
the corresponding original drug—set. We then ran DSEA on each ran—
dom drug—set and checked whether the golden—standard pathways of

box-plots show DSEA validation against the golden-standard when using
1000 random drug-sets containing the same number of drugs as in the ori-
ginal drug-sets. The horizontal line indicates the 0.05 significance threshold.
The P—value obtained by chance is close to 0.5, as expected (black segment in
each box shows the median P—value)

the original drug—set were significantly enriched at the top of the re—
sulting ranked list of pathways. Since these random drug—sets consist
of unrelated drugs, the golden standard pathways should not be sig—
nificantly enriched and the corresponding KS P—values should be un—
informative. The results are summarized in Figure 3. Observe that in
this significance analysis, we treated p—values as random variables,
thus their expected value should be close to 0.5 (Sackrowitz and
Samuel—Cahn, 1999, and Suppl. Fig. S14). It is clear from Figure 3
that using random drug—sets, DSEA ranks the golden—standard path—
ways at random positions.

3.2.1 Robustness and convergence

Hit compounds selected from automated drug screening techniques
may contain false—positive hits, exhibiting a mode of action incon—
sistent with the other compounds in the selected set. For this reason,
we investigated the effects of adding noise to the drug—sets used for
validation before running DSEA.

In order to assess the robustness of the method with respect to
varying degrees of false—positive hits included in the drug—set, we
added 1—10 random drugs to each of the 5 drug—sets and run DSEA
on the resulting augmented drug—sets. More precisely, we repeated
this process 1000 times thus producing a total of 5 x 10 x
1000 : 50 000 perturbed drug—sets and ran DSEA on each of them.

As before, we used the golden standard to evaluate the p—values
for the enrichment of golden standard pathways in the ranked list
given as output by DSEA.

As shown in Figure 4 adding up to 3 random drugs to the HSP9OI
drug—set, i.e. 75% of the initial set size, the golden standard pathways
are still significant showing the robustness of DSEA to false positives.

Number of random drugs added (ratio to initial size)

Fig. 4. DSEA Robustness. Golden-standard pathways' significance (P—values
on the y—axis) for the HSP90I drug-set with an increasing number of random
drugs (reported on the X axis) added to the drug-set. The horizontal line indi-
cates the 0.05 significance threshold. DSEA correctly identifies the golden-
standard pathways even when up to three random drugs are added to the
drug-set (75% of the drug-set)

Similar results were obtained for the other drug—sets: HSP9OI and CG
show robustness up to 75% false positives, CDK1 and HDI, up to
250% and 167%, respectively. Only in the case of TIs adding a single
false positive will cause the result to become not significant (refer
Supplementary Figs S4—S8). We hypothesize that the sub—set of drugs
in the TI drug—set not targeting TOP2 (3 out of 9 in the set) may partly
contribute to decrease the robustness of DSEA in this case.

To test the convergence properties of DSEA, we ran the analysis
by varying the number of drugs in the drug—sets, in order to under—
stand how many drugs were needed in order for the golden standard
pathways to become significant. Specifically, for each of the five
drug—sets, we generated all the possible combinations of subsets of
one drug, two drugs and so on, up the total number of drugs in the
drug—set, and then ran DSEA on each subset. Figure 5 shows the re—
sults for the HDI drug—set. It can be observed how the P—value of the
golden—standard pathways exponentially decreases when more drugs
are included in the drug—set, thus demonstrating the power of DSEA
in finding pathways shared in common by multiple drugs. We also
demonstrated that the same convergence property holds across the
other four drug—sets (Supplementary Figs S9—S13).

3.3 Example of application to antineoplastic agents

The cMap data were generated from experiments on cancer cell
lines. The multi—factorial nature of cancer is reﬂected by the hetero—
geneity of the pharmacological approaches to its treatment. The
World Health Organization (WHO) defined 5 main categories of
antineoplastic agents: Alkylating agents, damaging DNA to impair
replication; Antimetabolites, interfering with cancer cell metabol—
ism; Alkaloids, causing metaphase arrest; Cytotoxic antibiotics and
related substances, mainly affecting the function or synthesis of nu—
cleic acids; other, with different known or unknown mode of action.
We tested the ability of the DSEA in finding a common effect across
all the drugs in the cMap that have been annotated as antineoplastic
agents (code L01) by the WHO. The drug—set includes 23 drugs

horizontal line indicates the 0.05 significance threshold. For HDI subsets
greater than 3, DSEA ranks the golden-standard pathways significantly
(P< 0.05)

unevenly distributed across the five different subclasses. DSEA
ranked in the GO—BP database as the most significant pathway (out
of 3262): DNA damage response, signal transduction by 1753 class
mediator resulting in cell cycle arrest. This result is in line with the
common mode of action of antineoplastic drugs, particularly alky—
lating agents, which are the most enriched class of drugs in this
drug—set. The result of the analysis for all of the pathways is avail—
able as Supplementary Data.

3.4 Application to cystic fibrosis: correctors of
DF508—CFTR trafficking defects

CF is one of the most common genetic diseases among people of
Caucasian origin (O’Sullivan and Freedman, 2009). It mostly affects
lungs causing inflammation, tissue scarring and severe breathing dif—
ficulties, thus substantially impacting the patient life—span and qual—
ity of life. CF is caused by mutations in the gene coding for the
CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regulator) protein. The
most frequent mutation is the deletion of phenylalanine 508
(DF508). Wild—type CFTR translocates to the plasma membrane
where it acts as a chloride channel. Mutant DF508CFTR is unable
to fold correctly and, although partially functional, it is tagged for
degradation (O’Sullivan and Freedman, 2009). N0 therapeutic treat—
ment is currently available for this disorder. Nevertheless, thanks to
world—wide efforts of the academic and industrial research commu—
nity, some drugs with a mild ‘corrector’ activity for DF508CFTR
have been found, largely by HTS studies (Hanrahan et al., 2013).
However, each of these compounds has a different known MoA,
completely unrelated to CFTR function. Hence, the mechanism by
which these drugs are able to correct DF508CFTR function are
unknown.

To test the usefulness of DSEA in a ‘real—life’ scenario, we

The top—ranking GO-CC gene set, chloride channel complex, clearly identiﬁes the main common feature of the chosen drug-set. The top 10 enriched pathways

according to DSEA for each GO category resulting from the analysis of the 11

literature, and (ii) GEPs were available in the cMap dataset. As ex—
pected these drugs are very heterogenous and no obvious relation to
the correction of the DF508CFTR trafficking defects exists.

DSEA results for the GO—BP, GO—MF, GO—CC databases are re—
ported in Table 5 and for all the other pathway databases in online
Supplementary Data.

Strikingly the most significant pathway ranked in the GO—CC
database according to DSEA is the chloride channel complex. This
gene—set comprises 38 genes, including CFTR itself. Hence, DSEA
predicts that one mode of action shared in common by the 11 drugs
is the upregulation of chloride channel genes’ expression (since the
ES score associated to chloride channel complex for the drug—set is
positive as reported in Table 5). Note that this effect would have
never been detected by analysing GEPs of each individual drug sepa—
rately, as the median rank of the chloride channel complex across
the 11 drugs is 196. The 11 drugs belong to very different pharma—
cological classes, therefore the effect on the chloride channel gene

small molecules reported as DF508CFTR—correctors.

expression is detected by DSEA only because it is a common ‘side—ef—
fect’ shared by most of them.

To assess whether the DSEA—predicted shared MoA, i.e. up regula—
tion of chloride channel genes is reasonable, we searched the literature
of each of these drugs for evidence of chloride channel gene upregula—
tion. Known effects on CFTR expression have been reported for cardiac
glycosides (Srivastava et al., 2004, Strophanthidin in Table 5), HDAC
inhibitors (Hutt et al., 2010, Entinostat, Scriptaid, Tricostatin—A) and
Doxorubicin, a topoisomerase inhibitor (Maitra et al., 2001). These ob—
servations support the results of the DSEA analysis.

Additional signalling pathways, which are known regulators of
ion channels activity, are also notable in the DSEA results, such as
hormone activity, insulin receptor substrate binding, cytokine activ-
ity, which are ranked 2, 5, 9, in GO—CC; and signal recognition par-
ticle, ranked 4 in GO—CC.

We also investigated expected pathways which were not found
by DSEA. Of interest is the absence of references to protein folding

and ER quality control pathways, which seems to exclude a direct
role of these 11 drugs as chemical chaperons.

Experimental validations would certainly help in confirming the
validity of our hypothesis. However, a more in—depth experimental
analysis of these drugs falls out of the scope of our work.

Overall these results confirm the usefulness of this new approach
when investigating the shared MoA among a set of unrelated drugs
resulting from automated screening efforts.

4 Conclusions

We introduced DSEA, a computational approach to help elucidating
the mechanism of action of a set of drugs resulting from automated
screening techniques, also available online at http://dsea.tigem.it.

Hit compounds are selected from automated screening if they
are able to induce a phenotype of interest. Usually, these selected
drugs belong to different pharmacological classes, therefore the mo—
lecular mechanisms mediating their effectiveness on the screened
phenotype is not immediately obvious. DSEA aims at identifying
these mechanisms by looking for recurrent pathways modulated by
most of drugs in the set. This is achieved by analysing the transcrip—
tional response elicited by drugs, as available in the cMap database.

With DSEA, we present a new perspective in which drugs repre—
sent features of pathways (or genes). The most relevant pathway is
thus the one that is most dysregulated by the drugs in the set, as
compared with the other drugs in the database. The DSEA analysis
is thus able to highlight pathways that are targeted by most of the
drugs in the set. Applying DSEA after an automated screening study
can thus support the formulation of hypotheses explaining the effi—
cacy of the positive hits.

Beyond High Content Screening, a broad range of drug set gener—
ating applications that could take advantage of the DSEA can be
imagined. Similarity based methods, like Transcriptional Drug
Networks (Carrella et al., 2014) or Virtual Screening (Bajorath,
2002) could exploit DSEA to provide additional biological insights
about a drug neighbourhood. Prior knowledge about drugs can be
another method to define drug sets. In fact, it is the method we used
to define the drug sets for the cancer and cystic fibrosis examples.

In particular, for the cancer application, we defined a set by sim—
ply using ATC codes. Although a very heterogeneous class of drugs
was analyzed, the DSEA highlighted, as top in GO—BP, a pathway
that is very related to mechanisms of action commonly used by anti—
neoplastic agents. In the case of the cystic fibrosis application, in—
stead, we derived the set of DF508CFTR correctors by searching
relevant literature. DSEA provided a possible explanation of their
corrective effect as mediated by overexpression of CFTR and other
chloride channel genes. It is worth observing that expression profiles
in cMap were mostly obtained in MCF7 cells, which are very differ—
ent from bronchial epithelial cells where CFTR is active.
Nevertheless, also in this case DSEA was able to detect a strong sig—
nal related to the chloride channel complex, which was ranked as
the first most significant pathway in the GO—CC category.

The DSEA method was developed and has been validated in a
pharmacological context. However, it can be used to analyse any
biological condition inducing a measurable transcriptional pheno—
type, including different cell types, diseases and genetic perturb—
ations. Moreover, the method can be easily applied to other
experimental techniques, such as RNA—seq. The DSEA web site pro—
vides all the raw and processed data used by the tool, together with
pointers to external gene set databases. Moreover, relevant code is
maintained on GitHub (https://github.com/franapoli/signed—ks—test).
These resources are meant to facilitate the expansion of the DSEA

database of pathways and profiles, to encourage further develop—
ment of the methods and to ensure replicability of our results.

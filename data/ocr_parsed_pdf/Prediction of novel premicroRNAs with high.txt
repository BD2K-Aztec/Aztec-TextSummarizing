ABSTRACT

Summary: High-throughput deep-sequencing technology has
generated an unprecedented number of expressed short sequence
reads, presenting not only an opportunity but also a challenge for
prediction of novel microRNAs. To verify the existence of candidate
microRNAs, we have to show that these short sequences can be
processed from candidate pre-microRNAs. However, it is laborious
and time consuming to verify these using existing experimental
techniques. Therefore, here, we describe a new method, miRD,
which is constructed using two feature selection strategies based
on support vector machines (SVMs) and boosting method. It is a
high-efficiency tool for novel pre-microRNA prediction with accuracy
up to 94.0% among different species.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs, short RNAs (~20—25 nt) that perform their functions
by guiding mRNA transcriptional degradation or translational
suppression (Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009; Wu et al., 2010),
have various functions in organ development. For example, they
mediate switching of chromatin remodeling complexes in neural
development and participate in transcriptional circuits that control
skeletal muscle gene expression and embryonic development
(Chen et al., 2006; Yoo et al., 2009). Increasingly, evidence

demonstrates that they can also function either as tumor suppressors
or oncogenes (Bonci et al., 2008; He et al., 2005). Although more
microRNA functions are being discovered, there are still many novel
microRNAs whose functions remain to be elucidated.

To predict novel pre-microRNAs in speciﬁc animals and
plants, comparative genomic-based methods have been developed,
including MiRscan, MIRcheck, miRAlign and MIRFINDER
(Huang et al., 2007; Laufs et al., 2004; Lim et al., 2003; Wang
et al., 2005). Although these tools are capable of identifying
phylogenetically conserved stem—loop precursor RNAs, they do
not work well when applied to genomes that lack close homologs.
Recently, several machine leaming-based algorithms have been
introduced to predict microRNAs (Hsieh et (11., 2010; Jiang et al.,
2007; Xu et al., 2008). In addition, some modiﬁed no-learning
methods, based on simple and widely accepted principles, have been
used, where pre-microRNAs are detected by manually choosing
the optimal ﬁlter (Quail et al., 2008). Although these methods
have simple structures and ﬂexibility, their performance can still
be improved by combination with machine-learning methods.

In this study, we developed a novel machine-leamng tool, named
miRD (microRNA Detection) for accurate and efﬁcient detection
of novel pre-microRNAs. There are two sets of features and each
was used to build a support vector machines (SVMs) model.
(Vapnik, 2000). A boosting method was then applied to combine
the two independent SVM models (Freund and Schapire, 1996). We
tested the performance of miRD on a small RNA deep-sequencing
dataset of human fetal ovary. Altogether, 92 novel candidate pre-
microRNAs were predicted by miRD and were sorted in descending
order of the predicted probability (Supplementary Table S8). To
conﬁrm the expression of the predicted pre-microRNA, the top
16 candidates were selected for further experimental validation.
Surprisingly, all these selected pre-microRNA from human fetal
ovary were veriﬁed by real-time PCR (Supplementary Fig. S5).
miRD was more efﬁcient than any published algorithm (tripleSVM,
MIReNA), with its AC and MCC reaching 94.0% and 0.872,
respectively (Supplementary Table S6).

2 METHODS

Mature microRNAs can be processed from pre-microRNAs with two
different types of secondary structure: single-stem pre-microRNAs. which
typically have one paired stem and one symmetrical loop. and multi-stem
pre-microRNAs. which have several symmetrical or asymmetrical loops
(Supplementary Fig. S1). We collected 14 197 hairpin precursor microRNAs
of 133 species and 8494 pseudo pre-microRNA-like hairpins to construct
the training dataset. Different biological features were considered for single-
and multiple-stem pre-microRNAs. Strategy A detects the multi-stem pre-
microRNAs using a novel method. Since the standard stemiloop structure
contains a stable paired stem and a symmetrical loop. the differences between
the standard stemiloop and a candidate hairpin structure can be extracted as
a measure of the possibility that a candidate hairpin is a real pre-microRNA
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Strategy B characterizes the single-stem type. and
59 features were selected based on sequence and structure composition
(Supplementary Table S1). The kernel function of the SVM applied in this
model was chosen by the try-and-test strategy. and the radial basis kernel
was ﬁnally selected. A detailed description of the method is provided in the
Supplementary Material. The performance of miRD and its comparison with
other tools are shown in Supplementary Table S6.

3 APPLICATION

miRD has two applications in pre-microRNA prediction: (i) giving
the probability of a candidate pre-microRNA to be a real one; and
(ii) extracting the probable pre-microRNAs from deep-sequencing
data. To demonstrate how to use the miRD web server, we submitted
a sample data in FASTA format as an example (Fig. 1A). The
default parameters for feature selecting strategy, minimal free energy
of the secondary structure and paired nucleic acid number were

selected (Fig. 1B). As shown in Figure 1C, the prediction results
contain the probabilities of submitted candidate sequence to be real
pre-microRNA, information such as the secondary structure and the
minimum free energy. Users can also submit ﬁles containing short-
read sequences or information of read locations on the genome
(Fig. 1D). The candidate pre-miRNA sequences will be extracted
from the submitted data. miRD will then analyze these candidate
pre-miRNA sequences and return results as shown in Figure 1C.

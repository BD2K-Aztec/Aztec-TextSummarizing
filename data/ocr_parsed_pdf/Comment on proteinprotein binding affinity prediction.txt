1 INTRODUCTION

Predicting the strength of interactions between globular pro-
teins is a central and important topic in structural
bioinformatics (Moal et al., 2013). The amino acid sequence rep-
resents the chemical bonding in a protein which, along with the
solvent, dictates how it folds into an ensemble of thermally ac-
cessible states. In turn, structure speciﬁes the strength and iden-
tity of its binding partners, by establishing the specific
arrangements of intermolecular interactions and the intramo-
lecular strain required to achieve them. In a recent paper,
Yugandhar and Gromiha (2014) claim to be able to circumvent
this and predict proteiniprotein binding afﬁnities directly from
sequence with astounding accuracy. In this letter, we highlight
that

(1) Feature selection by stepwise regression is applied without
employing an information criterion, y-scrambling or reg-
ularization, and the method is not validated using an outer
cross-validation loop or external validation set.

(2) The reported energy functions contain many terms that are
functionally unrelated to binding.

(3) The reported prediction errors are signiﬁcantly lower than
experimental errors in the training set and variations due
to environmental factors.

(4) When an external test set is used, predicted afﬁnities have
a correlation of approximately zero with experimental
data.

2 STEPWISE REGRESSION IS USED
INAPPROPRIATELY

The work employs stepwise regression, a greedy forward selec-
tion algorithm. The authors arbitrarily limit the number of

parameters to five per model, not including the constant, instead
of using the Akaike or Schwarz information criterion or an early
stopping set to stop feature selection. Even with these methods,
using leave-one—out cross-validation for feature selection can still
result in inappropriate components being selected. The algorithm
selects from 113 uncorrelated (r<0.65) features. As the training
data is split into categories with a median of 12 complexes, the
number of parameters outweigh the number of observations by
an order of magnitude, making their method highly prone to
overﬁtting. A similar situation was encountered in some of the
kinetic rate constant models of Moal and Bates (2012), which
also employed stepwise regression. Even when early stopping
regularization was used, one of the models, with 27 observations
and 200 parameters to select from, gave an inner cross-validation
correlation of 1.0 and root mean square error of 0.0. However, in
this case an external model selection set was employed and used
to reject the model. An alternative validation would be to employ
an outer cross-validation loop around the stepwise regression, as
in the multivariate adaptive regression spline model reported in
Moal et a]. (2011); the algorithm used an inner bootstrap aggre-
gating loop for feature selection and pruning, with an outer
leave-one-out cross-validation loop for validation, supplemented
by a final external validation set. Neither of these overfitting
avoidance strategies were employed in Yugandhar and
Gromiha (2014). Instead, the authors use the same metric for
performance evaluation as for selecting features. This gives rise
to the discordances below.

3 THE ENERGY FUNCTIONS ARE REPLETE WITH
FUNCTIONALLY IRRELEVANT TERMS

The energy functions include many terms calculated using amino
acid parameters taken from the AAindex resource (Kawashima
et al., 2008). These include features that are functionally irrele-
vant to binding, such as amino acid weights in neural networks
for secondary structure prediction, 1H NMR spin-spin coupling
constants, and conformational propensities for turns, double
bends, helix termini or interdomain linkers. Moreover, the
terms are not found consistently between functions; the only
term that is selected more than once is the Kerr constant for
the amino acids, which is a measure of how refractive index
varies in an applied electric ﬁeld. As none of the selected
AAindex features are related to known factors relevant to pro-
teiniprotein interactions, it is likely that these are selected be-
cause they ﬁt the noise.

4 GENERALIZATION ERROR IS LOWER THAN
EXPERIMENTAL ERROR IN THE TRAINING SET

In the 72 complexes in the antibody/antigen, non-cognate,
G—protein and miscellaneous categories, the cross-validated
mean absolute errors (MAE) are reported in the 0.2414 kcal/
mol range. This is below the experimental uncertainties estimated
in Kastritis et a]. (2011) and Moal and Fernandez-Recio (2012)
by comparing differences in reported afﬁnities determined by
different laboratories (around 0.4 kcal/mol). Indeed, for the
G—protein and first miscellaneous category, the model error is
below the standard deviation typically reported from repeat
measurements within the same article using identical solutions,
conditions and equipment (up to 0.25 kcal/mol). Similar differ-
ences in binding can be found by varying the temperature in a
15 OC ambient temperature range or even changing the buffering
agent. Much greater differences arise from changing ionic
strength or pH, the latter of which can alter afﬁnity by
172 kcal/mol over the 5.}85 range (Kastritis et al., 2011),
which is greater than the MAE reported in all functional cate-
gories. Further, the interactions used include complexes of sub-
nanomolar afﬁnity, as determined using isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Both
SPR and ITC are prone to error when evaluating interactions of
such high strength, not to mention effects due to SPR tethering.
Taken together, this indicates that the reported cross-validated
prediction correlations (0.7H.99, mean 0.91) and errors (0.187
1.17 kcal/mol, mean 0.5 kcal/mol), cannot be used to estimate
generalization error and are a result of severe overﬁtting.

5 THE METHOD FAILS ON AN EXTERNAL
VALIDATION SET

Even when implemented correctly, high cross-validation perform-
ance is a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition for a predictive
model (Golbraikh and Tropsha, 2002). The most stringent test of a
model is its performance on an external validation set, which pro-
vides an objective estimation of predictive value. Such a dataset is
shown in the Supplementary Data, derived from Chen et a]. (2013)
by removing interactions involving chains of fewer than 50 residues,

as well as complexes which overlap with the training data. These were
submitted to the PPA-Pred web server (http://www.iitm.ac.in/
bioinfo/PPA_Pred/). For seven complexes, the server failed to
return a prediction (2OMZ, 2QNA, 3BEG, 3BLH, 3KNB, 3MCA
and 3OIQ). The results for the remaining interactions are shown in
Figure 1 and summarized in Table 1. A statistically insigniﬁcant
overall correlation of r = 0.07 (P = 0.67, n = 39) is observed, with
MAE of 2.7 kcal/mol. When looking at individual categories with
more than ﬁve members, statistically insigniﬁcant anti-correlations
are observed, with MAE ranging from 2.9 to 3.4 kcal/mol. By con-
trast, the known weak anticorrelation with BSA, buried surface area
(Chen et al., 2013; Kastritis et al., 201 1), is observed consistently in all
categories, and is statistically signiﬁcant overall and in the miscellan-
eous category. In conclusion, the method reported in Yugandhar and
Gromiha (2014) has been evaluated on a blind test set and found to
have large errors and a correlation of approximately zero, which
more accurately reﬂects predictive value than the initial ﬂawed
validation.

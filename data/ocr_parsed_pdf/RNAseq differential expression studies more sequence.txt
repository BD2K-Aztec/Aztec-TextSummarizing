4 CONCLUSON

We conclude that in a typical DE study using RNA—seq, sequen—
cing deeper for each sample generates diminishing returns for
power of detecting DE genes once beyond a certain sequencing
depth. Instead, increasing the number of biological replications
consistently increases the power signiﬁcantly, regardless of
sequencing depth. Additionally, estimation accuracy for logFC
and absolute expression levels greatly improve across the board
when more biological replicates are added, whereas sequencing
depth improves the accuracy of these estimations only in some
situations, so, when possible, using more biological replication
with lower sequencing depth, instead of sequencing few samples
in great depth, is a more efficient strategy for RNA—seq DE
studies. In the speciﬁc case of MCF7 breast cancer cell samples,
our cost metric suggests that sequencing >10M reads/sample
gives diminishing returns compared with adding replication.
Obviously, for other species and perhaps other samples such as
heterogeneous tumor samples, the exact sequencing depth will be
different, but the overall guideline of replication rather than
deeper sequencing should still remain. A similar set of standard
curves could be constructed for each type of sample to guide
experimental designs, particularly for large—scale genomic studies
where optimization for cost effectiveness can have a signiﬁcant
impact. Almost all individual laboratories are mindful of bud—
gets, but the stakes are particularly high in studies such as
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) or The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) where millions of dollars are being
spent on sequencing.

We have focused on differential expression studies using RNA—
seq with the aim to improve a single target: power to detect DE
genes between samples. Of course, there are cases where sequen—
cing deeply is advantageous (such as differential expression of
exons and transcript—speciﬁc expression). In these applications,
much higher sequencing depths are required because the inform—
ative genomic regions are much shorter. However, if gene differ—
ential expression is the primary goal, it would be a sensible choice
to optimize sequencing depth and number of biological replicates
according to the simple guidelines we propose here.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNase I hypersensi-
tivity assays with high-throughput sequencing have greatly acceler-
ated the understanding of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation,
although data reuse for the community of experimental biologists
has been challenging. We created a data portal CistromeFinder that
can help query, evaluate and visualize publicly available Chromatin
immunoprecipitation and DNase I hypersensitivity assays with high-
throughput sequencing data in human and mouse. The database
currently contains 6378 samples over 4391 datasets, 313 factors
and 102 cell lines or cell populations. Each dataset has gone through
a consistent analysis and quality control pipeline; therefore, users
could evaluate the overall quality of each dataset before examining
binding sites near their genes of interest. CistromeFinder is integrated
with UCSC genome browser for visualization, Primer3Plus for ChlP-
qPCR primer design and CistromeMap for submitting newly available
datasets. It also allows users to leave comments to facilitate data
evaluation and update.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide mapping of transcription factor and chromatin
regulator binding, histone modiﬁcations and chromatin accessi-
bility is essential for elucidating the regulatory network of various
biological processes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and
DNase I hypersensitivity assays with high-throughput sequencing
(ChIP-seq and DNase-seq) have become essential techniques for
studying transcriptional and epigenetic gene regulation. Most
ChIP—seq and DNase-seq studies have raw data available from
public repositories, such as NCBI Sequence Read Archive.
However, the raw sequencing data are usually in the order of
gigabyte size per sample, and data analysis is not only time-

consuming but also technically inhibitive for most experimental
biologists. Even if investigators only want to check a few speciﬁc
binding sites near their genes of interest, they need the computa-
tional resources and expertise to download the raw data, conduct
data analysis such as read alignment, peak calling, nearby gene
assignment and many others. In addition, these public datasets
are often of variable quality, and bioinformatics novices do not
often have the expertise to evaluate and compare different data-
sets. Although projects like ENCODE (ENCODE Project
Consortium, 2011) and Epigenome Roadmap (Bernstein et al.,
2010) provide processed data online, they only cover data
from these projects. We developed a web portal called
CistromeFinder, which contains the most comprehensive collec-
tion to date of public ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data in human
and mouse that have gone through a uniform data analysis and
quality control pipeline. It enables investigators to query, evalu-
ate, Visualize and compare public ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data
and select speciﬁc binding sites near genes of interest for
functional studies.

2 DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

We downloaded public ChIP-seq and DNase-seq datasets for
Homo sapiens and Mus musculus from high-throughput sequen-
cing data repositories such as Sequence Read Archive and ENA
(Leinonen et al., 2010), ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap
projects, and data websites linked to relevant papers. The
collection has 3887 human and 2491 mouse samples, including
ChIP-seq of 260 transcription and chromatin factors, 53 histone
modiﬁcations and variants and 326 DNase-seq samples
(Fig. 1A). When relevant replicates and corresponding controls
are available, we combined them to form a dataset. All asso-
ciated metadata were manually curated and standardized in
our previous work CistromeMap (Qin et al., 2012). They include
information on factor symbol, species, cell line, cell population,
cell type, tissue, disease state, authors, paper and data source, to
give users the ﬂexibility to search for and View data of interest.
All the raw data were processed in a standard pipeline using
bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) for read mapping, MACS
(Zhang et al., 2008) for peak calling, CEAS (Shin et al., 2009)

(B) Screenshot of dataset pages. (C) Screenshot for binding sites pages

for genome binding distribution and several other quality con-
trol scripts. The details of the pipeline protocol, including algo-
rithms and parameters used, as well as guidelines for interpreting
the Quality Control (QC) reports can be Viewed on the help page
of CistromeFinder. The CistromeFinder web interface allows
users to examine the pre-processed ChIP/DNase-seq datasets in
the following manner:

2.1 Search datasets

On the front page of CistromeFinder, users can search for
datasets by species and factor name or select from the full list
of available data by factor name. Additional options also allow
users to specify cell, tissue or disease name to narrow down
search results, which are useful for factors such as CTCF
with many different ChIP-seq datasets. The result page displays
a table of datasets with information on the cell, paper,
reference genome, data source, quick data summary, as well as
links to more detailed metadata and quality control measures
(Fig. 1B).

2.2 Evaluate datasets

Quality control measurements for each dataset include a sum-
mary of total read count, mapping rate, number of peaks, over-
lap with union of DNaseI hypersensitive sites (Thurman et al.,
2012), cross-species conservation (Pollard et al., 2010) and
genome-wide distribution of enrichment from CEAS.
CistromeFinder also allows users to leave comments to any
dataset to help other researchers in the community. If users are
satisﬁed with the data quality, they can use the data to select
binding sites.

2.3 Search binding sites

On average, each ChIP-seq dataset has ~10 000 binding sites,
and each DNase-seq dataset has >100 000 sites. Users have sev-
eral options to select binding sites: all binding sites (no limit),
those located in gene proximal regions [within :I:5 kb of any

transcription start site (TSS)], distal regions (from :I:5 kb
t0 :I:50 kb of any TSS) or proximal plus distal regions
(within :I:50 kb of any TSS). In addition, users could select bind-
ing sites near a speciﬁc gene and further ﬁlter binding sites that
overlap with repeat-masked sequences. After ﬁltering, the top
200 qualiﬁed binding sites are displayed in order of enrichment
false discovery rate.

2.4 Evaluate binding sites

Each selected peak in Section 2.3 will have information such as
genomic coordinates, ChIP-seq signiﬁcance score, distance to
nearby genes and DNA sequences centred at the peak summit
(Fig. 1C). Users can ‘View binding site’ signal proﬁle from UCSC
genome browser (Kent et al., 2002) or use Primer3Plus
(Untergasser et al., 2012) to design qPCR primers to validate
the binding of a factor near genes of interest in a speciﬁc cell
context.

3 CONCLUSION

CistromeFinder provides a comprehensive catalogue and uni-
form processing of published ChIP-seq and DNase-seq datasets.
The web interface provides ﬂexibility to search and Visualize the
binding of speciﬁed factors in various conditions near genes of
interest. Investigators can use CistromeFinder to check whether
a gene could be the potential target of a transcription or chro-
matin factor in a speciﬁc conditions and design ChIP-qPCR pri-
mers to validate the binding in other conditions. We also give the
users options to leave comments to help us evaluate datasets and
submit new data through CistromeMap to help keep the data-
base up-to-date. We will continue to maintain and improve
CistromeFinder as more ChIP/DNase-seq data become available
to facilitate the community in their transcriptional and epigenetic
gene regulation studies. We keep the raw data and the pipeline
script in case we need to rerun all the data with newest algo-
rithms; we also use a version system for the pipeline to reproduce
legacy results. In the future, we plan to combine Cistrome ana-
lysis pipeline (Liu et al., 2011) with our ChIP/DNase-seq data
collection; therefore, users could conduct integrative analysis of
their own data and public data.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: DNA enrichment followed by sequencing is a versatile tool
in molecular biology, with a wide variety of applications including
genome-wide analysis of epigenetic marks and mechanisms.
A common requirement of these diverse applications is a comparison
of read coverage between experimental conditions. The amount of
samples generated for such comparisons ranges from few replicates
to hundreds of samples per condition for epigenome-wide association
studies. Consequently, there is an urgent need for software that allows
for fast and simple processing and comparison of sequencing data
derived from enriched DNA.

Results: Here, we present a major update of the R/Bioconductor
package MEDIPS, which allows for an arbitrary number of replicates
per group and integrates sophisticated statistical methods for the de-
tection of differential coverage between experimental conditions. Our
approach can be applied to a diversity of quantitative sequencing
data. In addition, our update adds novel functionality to MEDIPS,
including correlation analysis between samples, and takes advantage
of Bioconductor’s an notation databases to facilitate annotation of spe-
cific genomic regions.

Availability and implementation: The latest version of MEDIPS is
available as version 1.12.0 and part of Bioconductor 2.13. The pack-
age comes with a manual containing detailed description of its func-
tionality and is available at http://www.bioconductor.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA enrichment methods are widely used for genome-wide
identiﬁcation of many different kinds of epigenetic marks.
These techniques include chromatin-immunoprecipitation for
localizing transcription factor binding sites or for revealing the
genomic distribution of different histone modiﬁcations.
Methylated DNA Immune-Precipitation (MeDIP) (Weber
et al., 2005) and methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) protein

capture (Serre et al., 2010) are similar techniques, but target the
enrichment of DNA fragments containing methylated cytosines.
Similarly, 5-hydroxymethylcytosines can be detected by anti-
serum speciﬁc to cytosine—5-hydroxymethylenesulfate (CMS)
after treatment with sodium bisulﬁte (Pastor et al., 2011). It
can be expected that further afﬁnity methods will be developed
for immunoprecipitation (IP) of known or novel kinds of epigen-
etic marks. To provide a general framework for efﬁcient genome-
wide differential coverage analysis of IP—sequencing data, we
have improved the user-friendly MEDIPS package. In contrast
to the previous version, the MEDIPS update is capable of pro-
cessing an arbitrary number of replicates or samples per condi-
tion. Furthermore, MEDIPS now integrates an elaborated
statistical framework developed for the digital nature of count
data, which includes a model for biological variation across rep-
licates (Robinson et al., 2010a), and has greatly reduced runtime
and memory requirements.

2 MEDIPS WORK FLOW

The MEDIPS package provides functions for the quality control
and analysis of data derived from IP—seq samples. It starts with the
aligned reads (typically bam files) and can be used for any genome
of interest. Figure 1 gives an overview of a typical work ﬂow.

2.1 Preparation

In the ﬁrst step, the alignment files (single- or paired-end) are
imported, and the fragments overlapping previously speciﬁed
genomic regions are counted. These regions can be either
genome-wide windows of regular width or any given regions of
interest. To control for polymerase chain reaction artifacts,
MEDIPS optionally replaces reads with the same position and
orientation by one representative.

2.2 Quality control

The saturation analysis helps to verify whether the given set of
mapped reads is sufﬁcient to generate a saturated and reprodu-
cible coverage proﬁle of the reference genome. This is done by
extrapolation of the correlation of subsets (see Fig. 1C).

To assess the effectiveness of the MeDIP/MBD enrichment, a
function to calculate overall CpG enrichment is provided.

2.3 CpG density normalization

It has been reported by Down et a]. (2008) that methylation
levels obtained from MeDIP/MBD experiments and bisulﬁte
sequencing cannot be compared directly. Therefore, MEDIPS
maintains its normalization function based on the concept of
CpG coupling analysis (Down et al., 2008) to calculate the rela-
tive methylation score (see Fig. 1D and E). It has been shown by
Chavez et a]. (2010) that this normalization can improve the
correlation to bisulﬁte data.

2.4 Differential coverage analysis

The main task for comparative epi genetic analyses is detection of
regions with differential coverage between conditions.
Variability, which can emerge from technical and biological vari-
ation, has to be estimated and modeled, and the statistical test
has to consider the discrete nature of the count values. For this
purpose, we make use of the edgeR package, which has been
developed in the context of RNA-seq by Robinson et al.
(2010a). It provides functions to estimate the biological

variability from low number of replicates and models the count
data using negative binomial distribution.

Alteration in copy number (CNA) are known to locally inﬂu-
ence the MeDIP signal (Robinson et al., 2010b). To control for
this interference, alterations in copy number are evaluated and
can be considered in further analysis.

To help with the functional interpretation of genomic regions
identiﬁed by the differential coverage analysis, MEDIPS pro-
vides the functionality to annotate these regions with any pro-
vided set of annotations. The features can be imported from
custom ﬁles, or from online databases, accessible from
Bioconductor.

3 APPLICATION

To demonstrate the functionality of the MEDIPS package, we
processed recently published MeDIP-seq data (Grimm et al.,
2013) that was generated to assess genome-wide epigenetic
changes in mouse intestinal adenoma. For this study, differential
methylation was inferred for the sample groups by calculating
Wilcoxon rank tests for the normalized count values (reads per
million, rpm) of each window. Differentially methylated regions
(DMRs) were determined by applying ﬁlters for P—Values, min-
imal coverage and ratios (Grimm et al., 2013).

Here, we process the same data but by using the presented
MEDIPS package version 1.12.0. The commented R script,
showing the function calls of this analysis, can be found in the
Supplementary Material. From the ﬁve adenoma and seven
normal control mouse samples, l4e22M MeDIP-seq reads
were uniquely mapped to the mouse reference genome
(NCBI37/mm9) using bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009), of which
~93% remain after replacing reads with the same position and
orientation by one representative. The saturation analysis indi-
cates sufﬁcient sequencing depth, and the CpG coverage indi-
cates an effective MeDIP enrichment (see Fig. 1C and
Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). Comparison of the normalized
relative methylation score values with bisulﬁte validation showed
a good overall correlation of 0.697079 with a set of bisulﬁte
validation assays previously performed by Grimm et a]. (2013)
on the same genomic samples (see Fig. 1E and Supplementary
Fig. S3). The edgeR test for differentially methylated regions
ﬁnds 51.722 DMRs (P<0.01), which correspond to 0.5% of
the genome. Correction for multiple testing leads to 110 regions
at 10% false discovery rate (FDR). Figure 1F shows the methy-
lation logFC versus average log methylation (MA-plot). DMRs
are depicted as orange points (P< 0.01) and red crosses
(FDR<0.1). The result table containing the DMRs can be
found in Supplementary Table S1. About 60% of the DMRs
identiﬁed by Grimm et a]. (2013) overlap with the DMRs iden-
tiﬁed by MEDIPS 1.12. A detailed comparison between the two
approaches can be found in the Supplementary Material.

Although the overall number of hypo- and hypermethylated
regions is balanced, preferential hypermethylation was found in
functionally important subgenomic regions, such as promoters
and CpG islands. In particular, CpG-rich promoters showed a
substantial enrichment of hyper- over hypomethylation (5:1; see
Fig. 1G). The identiﬁcation of CpG-rich promoters as preferen-
tial targets for hypermethylation may provide important leads
for further wet lab experiments. For instance, the analysis can be

helpful to identify binding patterns of epigenetic modulator com-
plexes and can be suited to identify candidate genes for epigenetic
transcriptional silencing.

The processing of the aligned reads took ~90 min on an AMD
Opteron 6380 2.5 GHZ computer, using 1 CPU core and allocat-
ing a maximum of 20 GB RAM.

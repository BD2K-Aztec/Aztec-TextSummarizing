ABSTRACT

Motivation: Next-generation sequencing coupled with metagenomics
has led to the rapid growth of sequence databases and enabled a
new branch of microbiology called comparative metagenomics.
Comparative metagenomic analysis studies compositional patterns
within and between different environments providing a deep insight
into the structure and function of complex microbial communities. It
is a fast growing field that requires the development of novel supen/ised
learning techniques for addressing challenges associated with meta-
genomic data, eg. sensitivity to the choice of sequence similarity cutoff
used to define operational taxonomic units (OTUs), high dimensionality
and sparsity of the data and so forth. On the other hand, the natural
properties of microbial community data may provide useful information
about the structure of the data. For example, similarity between species
encoded by a phylogenetic tree captures the relationship between
OTUs and may be useful for the analysis of complex microbial datasets
where the diversity patterns comprise features at multiple taxonomic
levels. Even though some of the challenges have been addressed by
learning algorithms in the literature, none of the available methods take
advantage of the inherent properties of metagenomic data.

Results: We proposed a novel supen/ised classification method for mi-
crobial community samples, where each sample is represented as a set
of OTU frequencies, which takes advantage of the natural structure in
microbial community data encoded by a phylogenetic tree. This model
allows us to take advantage of environment-specific compositional
patterns that may contain features at multiple granularity levels. Our
method is based on the multinomial logistic regression model with a
tree-guided penalty function. Additionally, we proposed a new simula-
tion framework for generating 168 ribosomal RNAgene read countsthat
may be useful in comparative metagenomics research. Our experimen-
tal results on simulated and real data show that the phylogenetic
information used in our method improves the classification accuracy.

1 INTRODUCTION

The diversity of the microbial world had been hidden from the
eyes of scientists until the advent of metagenomics. Despite the

Vital roles of microbes in our planet’s ecology, evolution and
human health, large populations of bacteria remain poorly char-
acterized because the majority of bacterial species have not been
successfully cultivated (Amann et al., 1995). The metagenomics
approach has offered a remedy: bypassing the need for isolation
and cultivation, all the sequences present in an environmental
sample are sequenced simultaneously, making it possible to
access the genetic information of otherwise hidden organisms.
The field of metagenomics has further been advanced by the
recent improvements in DNA sequencing technologies
(MacLean et al., 2009) that allow millions of reads to be pro-
duced at a high speed and affordable costs. Deep sequencing
allows for a high-resolution detection of rare species and pro-
vides an insight into phylogenetic composition and functional
diversity of complex microbial populations with many low-
abundance species. Along with the ability to access the genomes
of rare species, next-generation sequencing technologies have
also led to the rapid increase in the number and sizes of meta-
genomic sequencing projects. Exponential growth of sequence
data has enabled comparative analysis of microbial communities,
leading to a new branch of microbiology called comparative
metagenomics.

Comparative analysis extends insights into the structure and
function of microbial communities: it may help to identify com-
munity-speciﬁc properties of different environments as well as
discriminative properties between different conditions, and to
determine how microbial community composition is affected
by speciﬁc environmental changes. Comparative metagenomics
has broad implications for various ﬁelds of environmental
science and human biology. It may help to address the intriguing
question of identiﬁability of a core human microbiome
(Turnbaugh et al., 2007), to understand the relationship between
human microbiome and health and to study how microbial com-
position and function vary between distinct body sites and across
the human population. Comparative analysis has already led
to the discovery of three major enterotypes associated with
the human gut microbiota (Arumugam et al., 2011) and the
differences between lean and obese individuals (Turnbaugh
et al., 2006).

Microbial communities can be compared at the levels of
sequence composition, taxonomic diversity or functional poten-
tial. Taxonomic diversity provides detailed evolutionary infor-
mation regarding the community composition and therefore
has been a focus of many environmental and human studies
(Costello et al., 2009; Lozupone and Knight, 2007). To access
the taxonomic composition of a microbial community genomic

sample, both single marker gene sequencing and whole commu-
nity shotgun sequencing are widely used (Kembel et al., 2011).
The 16S ribosomal RNA gene [or 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)]
is a commonly used marker for bacterial identiﬁcation due to its
universal distribution among all bacterial species and a slow rate
of sequence evolution. To reduce the dimensionality of large se-
quence datasets generated by high-throughput sequencing of 16S
rDNAs, the reads are clustered into operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) W e, 2011) that roughly represent taxa at phylogenetic
levels deﬁned by a user-deﬁned sequence similarity cutoff. The
abundance of each OTU is deﬁned as the number of sequences in
the OTU. Representative sequences from each OTU are chosen
and used to assign taxonomy to the OTUs and to construct
phylogenetic trees. Packages such as QIIME (Caporaso et al.,
2010b) and Mothur (Schloss et al., 2009) provide integrated pipe-
lines for the analysis described earlier in the text. The whole
genome shotgun sequencing (i.e. metagenomics) approach can
also be used to study microbial community composition. It
offers a more global View of the community, but may not be
deep enough to detect rare species in a sample, and is sensitive
to the DNA extraction and sequencing protocols. Even though
the two approaches may not always lead to the same conclusions
about the community structure (Shah et al., 2011), they became
standard tools in microbial community analysis. In this article,
we will focus on samples based on the sequencing of 16S rDNAs
although our proposed method can be easily extended to meta-
genomic samples based on whole genome sequencing.

For 16S rDNA datasets, each sample is represented as a list of
OTUs and their frequencies. We will refer to these lists as feature
vectors. A feature vector corresponds to one microbial commu-
nity sample, and the vector’s elements (features) characterize
OTU frequencies in the sample. The evolutionary relationship
between all of the OTUs is captured by a phylogenetic tree. The
downstream analysis may involve the identification of compos-
itional patterns across samples from similar environments as well
as discriminatory features between different communities, asso-
ciations between human bacterial communities and disease
phenotypes, prediction of unknown labels for new samples and
so forth. These tasks require the development of new supervised
learning techniques that would take into consideration challenges
associated with microbial community data. For example, fea-
tures deﬁned by OTUs do not necessarily represent speciﬁc taxo-
nomic units because taxonomic levels are hard to deﬁne due to
the fact that only relatively a small number of bacteria have been
cultured. Moreover, it is hard to determine which taxonomic
resolution level provides features with the best discriminative
or predictive properties (Knights et al., 2011a). The environ-
ment-speciﬁc patterns may even comprise different lineages at
varying phylogenetic depth. Finally, a low overlap in species
between samples results in sparse and high-dimensional feature
vectors.

The problem of classiﬁcation of microbial communities is not
well-studied, even though classiﬁcation techniques have been
widely used in the field of bioinformatics, including classiﬁcation
of microarray cancer samples (Glaab et al., 2010), gene expres-
sion proﬁles (Asyali et al., 2006), protein families W i et al., 2012)
and so forth. Classiﬁcation of metagenomic (or 16S rDNA) sam-
ples may have useful applications enabling efﬁcient organization
and search in rapidly growing metagenomic (or 16S rDNA)

databases, detection of disease phenotypes in clinical samples
and forensic identiﬁcation.

One of the first applications of supervised learning techniques
to comparative metagenomics Wang et al., 2006) was the classi-
fication of soil and sediment samples according to environment
types using support vector machines (SVM) and K-nearest
neighbors algorithms. Recently, the feasibility of applying stand-
ard supervised classiﬁcation techniques to metagenomic/16$
rDNA data was studied on several benchmark datasets of
human microbiota (Knights et al., 2011b). MetaDistance (Liu
et al., 2011) is the first dedicated algorithm for multiclass classi-
fication of human microbiota. The algorithm combines the
advantages of instance-based and model-based methods, such
as K-nearest neighbors and SVM. The aforementioned methods
proved to be efﬁcient learning techniques and address some of
the challenges associated with the properties of metagenomic/ 16S
rDNA data. However, none of the methods have yet taken
advantage of the inherent properties of metagenomic data,
although phylogenetic information contained in metagenomic
samples has proved to be useful in comparative metagenomics.
For example, similarity measures that take into account phyl-
ogeny, e. g. UniFrac (Lozupone and Knight, 2005) and its
generalized versions (Chang et al., 2011), outperform non-
phylogenetic distance in their ability to recover natural clusters
of microbial communities (Lozupone and Knight, 2008). To in-
corporate phylogeny into the similarity measure, UniFrac-based
methods calculate the degree to which the input samples share
branch length on a phylogenetic tree. Another example of a
phylogeny-based similarity measure is the parsimony test
(Schloss and Handelsman, 2006), which uses Fitch’s parsimony
algorithm to compute the number of minimal changes along the
phylogenetic tree necessary to explain all the labels of the
sequences. A recursive phylogenetic distance was defined in
Meta-Storms (Su et al., 2012) for the purpose of fast indexing
of metagenomic databases.

Although phylogeny provides important information about the
natural hierarchical grouping of features, it has not yet been
adopted in classiﬁcation algorithms for microbial communities.
To incorporate the underlying structural information among the
features in learning problems, several regularization methods
have been proposed. For example, in the problem of tumor
class prediction from gene expression measurements, functional
groups of genes form the natural structure of data and the com-
bination of L1 and L2 norms were used to encode the groups and
variables within the groups (Jacob et al., 2009). The group lasso
penalty coupled with logistic regression (LR) was applied for
classiﬁcation problems with feature groupings and proved to be
useful in short DNA motif modeling and splice site detection
(Meier et al., 2008). Composite absolute penalty (Zhao et al.,
2009) extended the grouping approach to deal with overlapping
groups and with hierarchical orderings of the input variables that
reﬂect the order in which the variables should be included in the
solution. The idea of hierarchical grouping was later used for the
multitask regression learning problem where a tree encodes rela-
tionships between the elements of a multidimensional-dependent
variable, and a balanced weighting scheme to weight the
hierarchically overlapping groups was proposed (Kim and
Xing, 2010). Here, we show that the hierarchical grouping ideas
(Kim and Xing, 2010; Zhao et al., 2009) can be efﬁciently applied

Classification of microbial communities

 

to the multiclass classiﬁcation problem where information about
the natural hierarchical grouping of features is available.

In this article, we proposed a new multiclass classiﬁcation
method for 16S rDNA sequence (or metagenomic) samples
that takes advantage of the natural structure of microbial com-
munity data encoded by a phylogenetic tree. The leaf nodes
represent features corresponding to individual OTUs, and the
internal nodes may be considered as super features. The hierarch-
ical structure captures similarities and differences among the fea-
tures and allows for the consideration of features at different
granularity levels, which may be desirable given that the features
do not necessarily correspond to speciﬁc taxonomic units and
only represent groups of similar sequences. Thereby, some envir-
onment-speciﬁc patterns may comprise features at multiple
granularity levels. We proposed a multinomial LR model with
a tree-guided penalty that incorporates the hierarchy in the fea-
ture space and presented an efﬁcient optimization algorithm to
learn the model parameters.

We applied our algorithm to several real datasets of 16S
rDNA sequences from the human microbiota. We compared
the classiﬁcation performance of our method with several
state-of—the-art learning algorithms, and showed that incorporat-
ing the natural structure of the microbial data results in a model
with a better predictive power. We also performed a comprehen-
sive analysis of the proposed method by applying it to simulated
datasets of different complexity. Because the problem of classify-
ing 16S rDNA sequence samples is relatively new, there are no
simulated data generators that would generate the data appro-
priate for our goal. Current comparative studies use simulations
where features are generated independently from each other
rather than according to a phylogeny. Therefore, we introduced
a new simulation approach that uses the phylogenetic structure
of microbial communities to generate OTU count data and simu-
late scenarios where community-speciﬁc patterns may comprise
features at multiple levels of granularity. We showed that by
taking advantage of the phylogeny, our algorithm has a robust
performance with respect to the choice of feature resolution,
which corresponds to the selection of a similarity threshold
when deﬁning OTUs for the real data.

2 METHODS

We will ﬁrst deﬁne a classical multinomial LR model associated with our
classiﬁcation problem for 16S rDNA sequence samples. Then, we will
provide a background on how prior knowledge about the data, such as
sparsity and natural grouping, can be effectively incorporated into learn-
ing models. Finally, we will present a model for the classiﬁcation problem
that takes advantage of the hierarchical groups of features and describe a
fast optimization algorithm.

Consider a supervised learning problem where K microbial commu-
nities correspond to different environments or conditions. Each commu-
nity (class) is represented by several samples. Let N be the total number of
samples present in the dataset. A sample xi, 1' e {1, ..., N} is character-
ized by feature values representing the abundance values of each OTU,
xi = (x’i,x§, ...,xjw), where M denotes the number of features. Each
feature x; of xi is a continuous random variable. We will first consider
features as independent variables, but will later add more deﬁnitions and
extend the model to incorporate the information about the feature space
encoded by a phylogenetic tree. Let yi be a K—dimensional class variable,
where each component takes on binary values, so that y; = 1 if xi belongs

to community j, and y; = 0 otherwise. Our goal is to model class labels as
a function of the input features, i.e. to ﬁnd a classiﬁcation rule so that a
new 16S rDNA sample x can be assigned to one of the classes. The
goodness of the ﬁt is measured by the loss function L(x, y, ,8), where ,8
is a vector of model coefﬁcients. We formulate the problem as a multi-
nomial LR so that the probability of a class label given the feature vector
is modeled by the logistic function:

where 8;, = (,8’, , 8g, . . . , 83,4) is the vector of parameters corresponding to

the k-th class.

A new sample is assigned to a class with the highest conditional prob-
ability estimate. The model coefﬁcients ,8 are obtained to better ﬁt
the observed data, i.e. to minimize the loss function deﬁned as a
log-likelihood:

lvmm=ZZDWm—meaﬁ
i k i k

To incorporate additional knowledge about the parameters, a
Bayesian approach is often used. For example, the Gaussian prior
favors parameter values that are close to 0, whereas the Laplace prior
favors sparse solutions. Maximum a posteriori estimates of the model
coefficients yield penalty terms in the form of the L2 and L1 norms for
the Gaussian and Laplace priors, respectively. Finally, the optimal coef-
ﬁcients are obtained as a solution to a joint minimization of the loss
function and the penalty function:

argﬁmin L(x, y, ,8) + AT(,8),

where T(,8) = ||,8||2 and T(,8) = ||,8||1 for the two cases described earlier
in the text.

In some situations, it may be desirable to consider some features as a
group. Let 80" be a set of coefﬁcients that correspond to the i—th group of
features. The group penalty may be deﬁned as a combination of norms
for the groups and for coefﬁcients within each group. To incorporate the
hierarchical nature of the features, groups may be chosen to hierarchically
overlap. Let T be a tree that reﬂects the hierarchical relationship among
the features. Let us consider a node in a tree v e V and denote ,8G" to be a
set of coefﬁcients that correspond to features descendant from the node.
As suggested in Kim and Xing (2010), the tree-guided penalty may be

deﬁned as follows:
7m=ZZmW%,

k UEV

where the weight a), is associated with the node v and reﬂects a correl-
ation within the group of features descending from v. Because each

coefficient ,8; may correspond to multiple hierarchically overlapping
groups of coefﬁcients, it is important to penalize the coefﬁcients equally.
In particular, for each particular coefficient ,8}, the weights of all the
groups that contain this coefﬁcient should sum to one. A weighting
scheme that assures this property was proposed in Kim and Xing (2010):

g, H Sm if uis an internal node,
mEAnL'(u)
Sm otherwise,
mEAnL'(u)

LOU:

Eventually, the solution to our problem is found as the minimum of
the following function:

— Z Zyixiﬁk + Zanex’ti + AZZwullﬁf”llz-
i k i k k uey

Estimation of the model coefﬁcients requires solving a convex opti-
mization problem and therefore an efficient algorithm that scales up well
to handle large high-dimensional data is necessary. Newton methods are
intractable for high-dimensional data, whereas feature selection methods
may not have good statistical foundations as most of them consider fea-
tures in isolation, which is not desirable in our framework. Another chal-
lenge is that the penalty term is not differentiable at 0. A cyclic coordinate
descent algorithm is a fast and simple algorithm that has been efficiently
applied for the binary ridge LR model (Zhang and Oles, 2000) and ex-
tended to handle the non-smooth case of the lasso penalty (Madigan
et al., 2005). Our implementation for the tree-guided penalty is based
on the aforementioned algorithms.

The cyclic coordinate descent method minimizes a function by cyclic-
ally updating each coefﬁcient, while setting other coefﬁcients ﬁxed. The
procedure continues until the convergence criterion is met. Each update
involves a Newton step. Because Newton’s method is based on the quad-
ratic approximation of the objective function, large updates should be
avoided when the quadratic approximation is poor. We use an updating
rule suggested in the CLG algorithm (Zhang and Oles, 2000) and outlined
in Algorithm 1 (Madigan et al., 2005). When computing the step size 8%.,
unlike the CLG algorithm, we use the second derivatives directly rather
then their upper bounds.

For a smooth function, the update 8 would be

gram. [8) + Am»
ﬁzz/(Lea. 18) + Am» '

11k,- —_

However, the penalty function does not have a derivative at 81,,- = 0
because some of the terms in the penalty function contain the absolute
value of ,8kj. This happens because the L; norm “,8?” Hz degenerates to the
L1 norm ||,8kj| |1 when either v is a leaf node that corresponds to the j-th
feature, or v is an ancestral node of j and all the other coefficients des-
cendant from v are equal to 0. We will denote the set of nodes v that have
one of the aforementioned properties by ij. We follow the approach in
Madigan et al. (2005) to handle the non-smooth penalty. Speciﬁcally,
when 81,,- 7e 0 we use the following update rule:

If updating 81,,- results in a sign change, 81,,- is set to 0. If 81,,- = 0, we try
updating 81,,- in both directions, and if any of the updates results in a

decrease in the objective function L(x, y, ,8) + AT(,8), we update 81,,-
accordingly.

The implementation details that improve the computational efficiency
include (i) maintaining a list of non-zero data entries for each dimension,
(ii) storing the dot product of xi and 8;, and updating the result once 8;, is
updated, (iii) storing the sums of the exponentials 2k exiﬁz and updating
when the dot products in the exponents are updated, (iv) traversing the
tree in the bottom-up manner to locate the sets ij of ancestors for each
,8; to quickly ﬁnd which terms in the penalty function degenerates to the
L1 norms and (S) computing partial sums of the hierarchically overlap-
ping sets of coefﬁcients in a top-down manner.

3 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

3.1 Synthetic framework and performance analysis

Simulated data are often used for extensive performance evalu-
ation of algorithms under varying settings for which real data
may not be available. Current data simulators that are used in
comparative metagenomics simulate counts for each OTU inde-
pendently not taking into consideration phylogenetic relation-
ship between the species. For example, to evaluate the
performance of MetaStats (White et al., 2009), a statistical
method for the comparison of clinical metagenomic samples
(represented as counts of individual features such as organisms,
genes and functional groups), read counts for each feature were
generated according to negative binomial distributions independ-
ently from the other features. To evaluate phylogeny-based dis-
tance measures, such as UniFrac, microbial communities were
represented as circles or ellipses (Chang et al., 2011) with the
overlap patterns between these ellipses expressing similarity be-
tween the communities. Species were simulated by sampling
points from the interior of the ellipses. In this work, we propose
a novel simulation approach to generate OTU count data that
takes into account the input phylogeny and provides the ﬂexibil-
ity for generating community-speciﬁc patterns at multiple granu-
larity levels.

Our starting point is the common phylogenetic tree T that
relates OTUs in all the 16S rDNA samples. For the ease of
presentation, we will consider binary trees, although the model
can be easily generalized to handle any trees. To generate sam-
ples for a class k, we traverse the tree systematically, deciding for
each internal node u what fraction of species would come from
each of the subtrees rooted at the child nodes of v. We associate
two parameters with each node v for each class k. Let #1,“, denote
the average proportion of species that correspond to the subtree
rooted at the left child node of v in the k—th class, and let (of)2
denote the variance of this proportion within the class. A new
class sample is generated by sampling the proportions of species
at each node v according to the normal distributions
N04“), (032). The parameters values 0’; are in turn sampled
from the normal distribution N(/1U,6,2,), where parameters 63
characterizes the variance between the classes, and ﬂu are some
‘base’ values that are initialized randomly. The simulation
pipeline is outlined in Figure 1.

We control the within- and between-class variances using the
parameters (of)2 and 8,2,, respectively. We observed that in real-
world datasets both variances tend to increase toward the leaves
of the tree (see Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). To incorporate
such a behavior into our framework, we define coefﬁcients )7 and

3.2 Comparisons

We compared the performance of our proposed method with
some of the popular classiﬁcation techniques such as SVMs, LR
and Random Forests (RFs), and with a dedicated classiﬁcation
algorithm for metagenomic (or 16S rDNA sequence) samples,
MetaDistance. SVM (Ben-Hur et al., 2008) is a robust and power-
ful classiﬁcation method that has widespread applications in many
ﬁelds including computational biology. The idea behind the SVM
technique is to ﬁnd the separating hyperplane in a feature space
with the largest margin between the classes. We considered the
Ll-regularized version of SVMs due to its ability to handle high-
dimensional sparse data. RF (Boulesteix et al., 2012) is another
popular classiﬁcation algorithm that consists of a collection of tree
predictors and makes the overall prediction by the majority
voting. The algorithm is well known for its capability of dealing
with small sample sizes, high-dimensional feature space and com-
plex data. LR (Wu et al., 2009) has been widely used in statistics
for many years and has recently received much attention in the
machine learning community. In particular, its Ll-regularized
version is known to have good generalization performance in
the presence of many irrelevant features. MetaDistance (Liu
et al., 2011) is a classiﬁcation method for samples of 16S rDNA
sequence counts. It is based on simultaneously minimizing the
intraclass distance and maximizing the interclass distance by com-
bining instance-based and model-based learning techniques. For
the comparison with the SVM and LR classiﬁers, we used the
implementations in the Machine Learning Python GVILPY)
Python package (Albanese et al., 2012), for the RF classiﬁer, we
used scikit-learn Python package (Pedregosa et al., 2011) and for
MetaDistance, we used the Matlab implementation (Liu et al.,
2011). For all the classiﬁers, we performed 10-fold cross-validation
to ﬁnd the optimal model parameters (see Supplementary Table
S1) and 3-fold (or 5-fold) cross-validations for the performance
evaluation on simulated (or real, respectively) datasets.

3.3 Performance on simulated data

quence alignment of the representative sequences is built using
PyNAST (Caporaso et al., 2010a). Finally, the phylogenetic tree relating

considered the variance coefﬁcients )7 and )7 of 0.5, 1 and 1.5.
A complete binary tree of height 10 was used to guide the simu-
lation. For each parameter set, we generated datasets with dif-
ferent granularity by cutting the tree at different heights to
produce feature vectors with different resolutions. The perform-
ance of our algorithm for all the parameter sets and resolution
levels is shown on Figure 3. We observed that the classiﬁcation
task became harder when the number of classes increased. Also,
as expected, the classiﬁcation error rate reduced when )7 was
decreased and )7 was increased. We also observed that, for
some parameter settings, the best performance was achieved at
the highest resolution levels, whereas for the other settings the
best performance might be achieved at some intermediate reso-
lutions. This happened when the between-class variance was
dominated by the within-class variance at high resolution
levels, leading to an increased overlap between the classes. The
use of the information about the hierarchical grouping of the
features makes it possible to take advantage of the lower reso-
lution feature space where the classes may be better separated.
Figure 3 shows that the accuracy of our method at the highest

We compared our algorithm with the other classiﬁers under a
variety of parameter sets and plotted the results in Figures 4
and 5. The mean and standard deviations of the relative perform-
ance of the algorithms at the highest resolution level are shown in
Table 1. Overall, LR performed reasonably well in most of the
test cases, whereas SVM had an inferior performance compared

with the other algorithms. RF performed poor when the number
of classes was small, but improved signiﬁcantly when the number
of classes increased. In most of the test cases, our algorithm
achieved the best performance and was more robust with respect
to the resolution level. That is, when the optimal classiﬁcation
accuracy was achieved at some intermediate resolution, the per-
formance at the highest resolution was still reasonably close to
the optimal. Figures 4 and 5 show that the performance

difference between the algorithms is especially noticeable at the

3.4 Performance on real data

We used three real datasets of the human microbiota to evaluate
our algorithm. All the datasets were taken from the 16S riboso-
mal RNA sequencing studies and preprocessed as shown in
Figure 2 using the QIIME software (Caporaso et al., 2010b).
Using different OTU similarity cutoffs, we generated feature vec-
tors of different granularity for each of the datasets. The dataset
D1 is described in (Costello et al., 2009) and comprises samples
from six major body areas: external ear, gut, hair, nostril,
oral cavity and skin. The second dataset D2 contains gut samples
from lean, obese and overweight subjects (Turnbaugh et al.,
2009). The third dataset D3 is described in the study of
microbiota in healthy adults (Human Microbiome Project
Consortium, 2012) and contains samples from ﬁve body habi-
tats: oral, gastrointestinal, urogenital, nasal and skin. Datasets
D1 and D3 represent relatively easy classiﬁcation problems
because they comprise microbial communities from different
body sites, which are known to be signiﬁcantly different. On
the other hand, D2 illustrates an example of a more challenging
classiﬁcation task because the classes correspond to microbial
communities from the same body habitat and thus are similar.
To support the conclusions about the difﬁculty of the problems
represented by the three datasets, we have computed the average
within- and between-class variances for each dataset (see
Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). We observe that, compared
with D1 and D3, dataset D2 on average has a lower between-
class variance, which conﬁrms that the corresponding classiﬁca-
tion problem is more challenging.

The classiﬁcation error rates for all the classiﬁcation algo-
rithms at all the granularity levels are shown in Table 2. On
average, all the algorithms show a better performance at higher
resolution levels that correspond to the higher OTU similarity
cutoffs. Our algorithm shows a comparable performance at the
lower resolution levels and outperforms the other methods at the
higher resolution levels.

We did not evaluate the computational efficiency of the algo-
rithms systematically because they are implemented in different
programming languages. Some of the entries are missing in
Table 2 due to overly long processing time. More specifically,
we were unable to preprocess the dataset D3 at 97% similarity
cutoff with QIIME on our desktop PC. Therefore, we did not
run any of the classiﬁcation algorithms on the dataset at 97%

similarity cutoff. MetaDistance was two orders of magnitudes
slower than the other algorithms. For example, the training
step for the dataset D1 with 90% OTU similarity cutoff for
just one set of parameters took ~1s for LR and SVM, 3s for
our algorithm, 5s for RF and 12 min for MetaDistance.
Therefore, running cross-validation on multiple sets of param-
eters would take days or weeks to compute on some datasets for
MetaDistance.

4 CONCLUSION

We proposed a new classiﬁcation method for 16S rDNA se-
quence samples that uses the natural structure of microbial com-
munity data encoded by a phylogenetic tree. We showed that
using the phylogenetic information leads to an improved classi-
ﬁcation accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art classiﬁca-
tion algorithms. Unlike many popular classiﬁcation methods,
which consider features (or OTU frequencies) in isolation, our
method takes advantage of the similarities between OTUs
encoded by the phylogenetic tree. We applied the algorithm to
classify samples obtained from 16S rDNA studies, but the
approach can also be used to classify metagenomic samples ob-
tained by whole genome sequencing. The algorithm only requires
frequencies of taxonomic groups in each sample and a phylogen-
etic tree that relates these groups.

Even though our model does take advantage of the natural
hierarchical grouping of OTUs, features are still defined as indi-
vidual OTUs (the leaves of the phylogenetic tree). Nevertheless, a
microbial community may be characterized by several lineages
of varying phylogenetic depth. Knights et al. (2011a) gives an
example of a hypothetical disease characterized by concurrent
over-representation of a particular phylum, genus and species.
Therefore, rather than deﬁning features as tree leaves, a subset
of intermediate nodes of the phylogenetic tree may lead to more
powerful classiﬁcation models for complex microbial

tiple granularity levels explicitly is a potential direction for
future work.

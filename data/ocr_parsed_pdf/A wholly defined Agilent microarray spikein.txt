ABSTRACT

Motivation: Spike-in datasets provide a valuable resource for
assessing and comparing among competing microarray analysis
strategies. Our previous wholly defined spike-in datasets, the Golden
and Platinum Spikes, have provided insights for the analysis of
Affymetrix GeneChips. However, a similar dataset, in which all cRNA
identities and relative levels are known prospectively, has not been
available for two-color platforms.

Results: We have generated a wholly defined spike-in dataset
for Agilent microarrays consisting of 12 arrays with more than
2000 differentially expressed, and approximately 3600 background,
cRNAs. The composition of this ‘Ag Spike’ dataset is identical to that
of our previous Platinum Spike dataset and therefore allows direct
cross-platform comparison. We demonstrate here the utility of the
Ag Spike dataset for evaluating different analysis methods designed
for two-color arrays. Comparison between the Ag Spike and Platinum
Spike studies shows high agreement between results obtained using
the Affymetrix and Agilent platforms.

Availability: The Ag Spike raw data can be accessed at

1 INTRODUCTION

Since their introduction in the mid-1990s (Lockhart et (11., 1996;
Schena et (11., 1995), DNA microarrays have become a leading tool
in a diverse assortment of research disciplines, including cancer
and other disease research, developmental biology and evolutionary
biology. The popularity of microarrays owes much to their ability to
simultaneously interrogate the expression level of tens of thousands
of genes, enabling genome-scale transcriptional proﬁling of multiple
tissues in essentially a single experiment. Although next-generation
sequencing approaches such as RNA-Seq provide potentially
compelling advantages over microarray-based gene expression

proﬁling—no limitation to known transcripts, no cross-hybridization
issues and a broader detection range for expression levels (Wang
et (11., 2009)—comparisons between these two technologies have
indicated that RNA-Seq may have less accurate measurement
of absolute RNA expression level (Willenbrock et (11., 2009),
less sensitive detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
(Git et (11., 2010) and a higher error rate for weakly expressed genes
(Liu et (11., 2011). For the present, therefore, microarrays remain an
important, cost-effective and mature platform for gene expression
proﬁling.

The beneﬁt of proﬁling numerous genes simultaneously by
microarrays leads to one of the technique’s biggest drawbacks:
it is generally not possible to independently verify such a large
number of individual data points, making it difﬁcult to assess the
accuracy of the data analysis. This is of particular concern due to
the tremendous number of microarray data analysis methods, which
have proliferated in tandem with the increased use of the arrays
themselves.

Most previous studies of microarray performance, including
the microarray quality control (MAQC) project, used RNA
samples in which the identities of most of the individual RNA
transcripts were not known (Affymetrix Latin square data,
www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/sample_data/datasets.affx;
Irizarry et (11., 2003; Kerr, 2007; McCall and Irizarry, 2008;
Patterson et (11., 2006; Zahurak et (11., 2007). Such an experimental
design limits the evaluation of accuracy to only a small number of
spike-in cRNAs present in the sample. We previously generated
two wholly deﬁned control datasets for the Affymetrix GeneChip
platform, the Golden Spike and Platinum Spike datasets (Choe
et (11., 2005; Zhu et (11., 2010). In these ‘spike in’ experiments, the
identities and relative concentrations of the complete complement
of present cRNAs are known. Over 1300 cRNAs are differentially
expressed with designated fold changes ranging from 1.2 to 4, and
over 2500 cRNAs serve as background with constant expression
levels. We and others have used these datasets to determine optimal
methods for analysis of Affymetrix microarrays under various
experimental conditions (Chen et (11., 2007; Choe et (11., 2005;
Hochreiter et (11., 2006; Pearson, 2008; Schuster et (11., 2007a, b;
Turro et (11., 2007; Zhu et (11., 2010). Unfortunately, similar wholly
deﬁned spike-in datasets do not exist for other popular microarray
platforms, in particular for dual-channel platforms. Different from
Affymetrix’s single-channel design, for dual-channel microarrays
the two samples to be compared are labeled separately with different
ﬂuorescent dyes [e.g. cyanine-3 (Cy3) and cyanine-5 (Cy5)] and

then hybridized simultaneously to the same array, allowing for
direct comparison of differential expression. These differences in
array technology require differences in data analysis. For instance,
Affymetrix arrays typically call for interpreting both perfect match
(PM) and mismatch (MM) probe values and combining the separate
probe pairs into a probe set level expression summary (although
some Affymetrix platforms, such as whole-transcript expression
arrays, use only PM probes). Two-color arrays, on the other hand,
require normalizing between ﬂuorophore channels, correcting for
possible differential incorporation of the ﬂuorescent dyes, and
comparing intensity ratios rather than absolute intensities to detect
DEGs (Churchill, 2002; Duggan et (11., 1999).

In order to facilitate evaluation of the various analysis methods
required for dual-channel arrays, we generated a fully controlled
spike-in dataset for one such platform, Agilent. We refer to this
dataset as the ‘Ag Spike’ experiment due to its use of the Agilent
platform and to denote its relationship to the Golden (Au) and
Platinum (Pt) Spike studies. The Ag Spike dataset has a cRNA
composition identical to that in our previous Platinum Spike dataset
and consists of 12 arrays including technical replicates and dye
swapped arrays. To illustrate the utility of the Ag Spike dataset,
we evaluated 26 analysis routes, derived from combining several
methods in individual steps of the analysis procedure, for their
performance in detecting DEGs. In addition, we compared the results
from this dataset and the Affymetrix-based Platinum Spike dataset
and found high concordance across platforms. The Ag Spike dataset
comprises a useﬁil resource for further studies of optimal analysis
methods for dual-channel microarrays.

2 METHODS

2.1 cRNA sample preparation and hybridization

We used the same 28 PCR pools that had been used before to generate
the Platinum Spike dataset. These pools contain PCR products from 5725
Drosophila Gene Collection release 1.0 (DGCrl) cDNA clones. We mixed
PCR products from all pools together with speciﬁed relative abundance to
generate two samples representing the A and B conditions. Both samples
were in vitro transcribed and then labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 ﬂuorescent dye.
Labeled A samples were hybridized with B samples labeled with reverse dye
to three Agilent Drosophila Gene Expression microarrays. The process from
in vitro transcription to hybridization was repeated twice (Fig. 1). Note that
because samples were mixed as a pool. cRNAs from the same pool have
identical fold change values between conditions (Table 1). At the end. we
generated 12 arrays that were randomly placed in three independent slides
to remove potential systematic error due to array position (Supplementary
Material).

2.2 Probe fold change assignment

We ﬁrst identiﬁed the probes hybridized to cRNAs present in samples
by aligning the sequences of all probes to the obtained clone sequences.
Alignment was done using BLAST (Altschul et (11.. 1990) (version 2.2.18)
with word size seven. no complexity ﬁlter and e-Value cutoff 1. In order to
assign a probe to a speciﬁc clone. we required no fewer than 40% of the
probe sequence matched identically to the clone sequence on the correct
strand with no gaps (Supplementary Material). Probes assigned to multiple
clones or to clones with multiple fold change values were excluded from
our analysis. Therefore. using relatively low sequence identity cutoff in
clone assignment step allowed us to remove potential cross-hybridization.
For each probe uniquely assigned to a clone. the fold change value of the
corresponding clone was assigned to the probe. If this clone had multiple

potential sequences. we required that no fewer than 90% of the potential
sequences mapped to the probe in order to assign the fold change value to
the particular probe (Supplementary Material).

2.3 DEG detection

2.3.1 Preprocessing Background correction was either skipped or
performed using one of the two different methods: normexp and rma.
Within-array normalization was either not performed or performed with
[new normalization. Later on between-array normalization step was skipped
or performed using quantile normalization. We have previously found that
normalization among all arrays performed the best when up- and down-
regulation was balanced between the two compared conditions (Zhu et (11..
2010). Therefore all 12 arrays in Ag Spike dataset were normalized together
during the between-array normalization step. These preprocessing methods
were from the LIMMA Bioconductor library (Ritchie et (11.. 2007; Smyth and
Speed. 2003). We also performed preprocessing using only Agilent’s Feature
Extraction software (FE; version 9.5.3.1). followed by testing for DEGs as
described below.

2.3.2 DEG tests Two different methods were used for prediction of
DEGs: fold change (simply calculating log; fold change between the A
and B conditions) or LIMMA (Smyth. 2004). In this step. we treated
technical replicates as biological replicates. because the variation introduced
by independent sample preparation was much smaller than the variation
introduced by hybridization (Supplementary Fig. S 1).

We did note that the probe intensities from one array (Afysty3-2) are
higher than those of the other arrays. including its own corresponding
technical replicates (Supplementary Fig. S2). This suggests that a technical
error occurred in the handling of this array. However. the preprocessing
procedures. including background correction and normalization. were able
to bring this array comparable with other arrays [Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient between this array and its technical replicates improves from
0.420 and 0.530 to 0.842 and 0.845 (Supplementary Fig. S3). and the median
correlation between this array and its biological replicates is 0.758 after
preprocessing]. and the best performance for DEG detection using all 12
arrays was found to be slightly better than when excluding the particular
array (data not shown). Therefore. our analysis included all 12 arrays in the
Ag Spike dataset.

2.4 Receiver operating characteristic curves

For routes using fold change to detect DEGs. the absolute values of log; fold
change were given to the ROCR library (Sing et (11.. 2005) to generate the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculate the area under
the curve (AUC) values. For routes using LIMMA. the AUC values were
calculated based on the absolute values of the corresponding test statistics.

2.5 Variance component analysis

We ﬁtted the raw foreground intensities corresponding to a given probe across
all arrays from the same condition with a mixed effect model: log2(YiJ-k)=
11+oti +Bj +801. where 1 refers to different dye. j refers to independent
sample preparation. k refers to individual array; 1: 1,2,j = 1,2 and k = 1, 2, 3.
The model was ﬁt separately on the arrays from each condition. Yijk was
the raw foreground probe intensity. 011 and 012 corresponded to the effect of
different ﬂuorescent dye. Bf. which is assumed to follow a normal distribution
with mean 0 and variance 03(Bj ~N(0, (7%)). represented the effect of
independent in vitro transcription and labeling. eijk ~N(0,r72) represented
the residual error within technical replicates. We refer to the two variance
components rig, and :72 as biological variance and technical variance for
convenience. which estimate the variation introduced by sample preparation
and array hybridization. respectively. The mixed effect model was ﬁt using
the lmer function from the lme4 library (Bates et (11.. 2008). and the restricted
maximum likelihood estimators of the variance components were obtained.

2.6 Computation
All computation was performed using RedHat Enterprise Linux 4. 2.6 Kernel.

R version 2.7.2 (R Development Core Team. 2008). and Bioconductor
version 2.2 (Gentleman et (11.. 2004).

3 RESULTS

The Ag Spike dataset involves two groups of six arrays each from
two independent sample preparations. The six arrays within each
group contain three technical replicates and their corresponding dye-
swapped pairs. Each array was hybridized with samples from two
different conditions (‘A’ and ‘B’) (Fig. 1). The cRNA composition
under each condition is identical to that in our previous Platinum
Spike dataset except that the 26 cRNAs spiked with known absolute
concentration in the Platinum Spike dataset were excluded here (Zhu
et (11., 2010). The Ag Spike dataset contains 1134 and 935 cRNAs
up- and down-regulated, respectively, in condition A compared with
B, with fold change values varying between 1.2>< and 4X. The
relative concentrations of another 3643 RNAs were kept unchanged
between the two conditions. Similar to the Platinum Spike dataset,
the Ag Spike dataset is balanced with respect to total labeled RNA
amount and extent of up- and down-regulation for each experimental
condition.

3.1 Detection of DEGs

To identify DEGs between the two compared conditions, 26 different
routes were used to process the raw probe intensities in the Ag
Spike dataset. These routes used different methods for background
correction and normalization and used different test statistics for
detecting DEGs. The performance of all routes was evaluated with
rAUC0.05 (0 grAUCOOS f 1, larger values =better performance),
which measures the AUC value relative to the maximum (0.05) when
the false positive rate (1—speciﬁcity) is £0.05 (Supplementary
Table S1).

Most routes give reasonable performance [median

false positive rate is £0.05)=0.873]. The best route for DEG
detection in the Ag Spike dataset used normexp background
correction, 10ess within-array normalization, and no between-array
normalization and LIMMA for DEG testing (rAUC0.05=0.823,
TPR0.05=0.890). The performance of this route is comparable
with the 97.8 percentile of routes evaluated in the Platinum Spike
dataset based on rAUC0.05. In the background correction step,
we found routes using normexp method perform consistently
better than routes using other methods, while routes using the rm(1
background method perform worse than most routes. Similarly,

using 10ess within-array normalization leads to better performance
than skipping within-array normalization (Figs 2 and 3). However,
at the step of between-array normalization and DEG testing, no
superior method is found as those corresponding to better average
performance also result in large variation of performance (Fig. 3
and Supplementary Fig. S4).

3.2 Comparison with the Affymetrix dataset

Consistency across platforms has been a concern for microarray
utilization (Li et (11., 2002; Tan et (11., 2003). In previous efforts to

If one clone can be mapped to multiple probes/probesets. the median statistic
or median log2(fold change) is plotted. Clones are highlighted in different
colors based on their fold change levels (A versus B condition). The non-
parametric Kendall’s concordance coefﬁcient (W) was calculated using the
irr library in R.

address this issue, arrays from different platforms were hybridized
with identical samples but with little information about the
constituent RNAs (Irizarry et (11., 2005; Jarvinen et (11., 2004;
Patterson et (11., 2006; Tan et (11., 2003). The identical cRNA
composition between the Ag Spike dataset and our previous
Platinum Spike dataset allowed us to assess the consistency of
the results from the two different platforms. We found that the
overall performance of DEG detection is quite close between the best

route from the Ag Spike dataset (normexp background correction,
10ess within-array normalization, no between-array normalization
and LIMMA for DEG detection) and the best route from the Platinum
Spike dataset (gcrma-reb background correction, scaling probe
normalization among all arrays, using only PM probe intensities
for medianpolish summarization, vsn probe set normalization
among technical replicates and using CyberT for DEG detection)
(rAUC0.05 = 0.823 and 0.848, respectively). With false positive rate
3 0.05, 89% of the probes assigned to clones with distinct amounts in
the two conditions are correctly detected as differentially expressed
in the Ag Spike dataset, comparable with the top TPR0.05 of 88%
in the Platinum Spike dataset. We then focused on the 4935 clones
that have assigned probes/probesets in both platforms and compared
the concordance between test statistics from the two platforms using
the best route from each. We found the test statistic values from the
two platforms agree well with each other (Kendall’s concordance
coefﬁcient W = 0.853, Fig. 4A). We also observed high concordance
when comparing the log2(fold change) between conditions A and
B of the two routes (Kendall’s concordance coefﬁcient W=0.854,
Fig. 4B). These results suggest that high concordance between the
two platforms can be achieved when hybridization and data analysis
are properly performed, consistent with results from the MAQC
study (Patterson et (11., 2006).

4 DISCUSSION

We have generated the ﬁrst wholly deﬁned control dataset for the
Agilent platform including over 2000 DEGs and 3600 non-DEGs.
Using this control dataset, we compared a total of 26 analysis routes
for detecting DEGs as a ﬁrst-pass evaluation of the many existing
analysis methods for dual-channel microarrays. The preprocessing
steps of normexp background correction and 10ess within-array
normalization performed better than other compared methods and
were able to correct for technical errors that had resulted in overall
higher intensities in a single array. We found that the results from
the Ag Spike dataset were highly consistent with results from the
Platinum Spike dataset, whose cRNA composition is identical to
the current dataset but which was performed using the Affymetrix
platform, when best routes from each analysis were compared.
The Ag Spike dataset should prove a valuable community resource
for further evaluation of the Agilent platform and for analysis of
dual-channel microarrays in general.

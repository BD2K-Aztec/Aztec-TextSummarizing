2015 marks the first year that the International Society for
Computational Biology (ISCB) honors one of its members with the
Outstanding Contributions to ISCB Award. This award recognizes
an ISCB member who has made unique and lasting contributions to
ISCB through exemplary leadership, education, service, or a com—
bination of these elements.

Lawrence (Larry) Hunter, Professor at the University of
Colorado Medical School, is the inaugural winner of the
Outstanding Contributions to ISCB Award. He will receive this
award at the 2015 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology/
European Conference on Computational Biology (ISMB/ECCB) in
Dublin, Ireland in July 2015.

Larry Hunter: Founding Father of ISMB and ISCB

Larry Hunter pursued computational biology as a graduate student
at Yale University in the 1980s before such a term for the field
existed. He built a computer program that used case—based reason—
ing to diagnose lung tumor pathology, but he felt frustrated by the
limits of computation having a noticeable impact on disease out—
comes (Gibson 2012). As a freshly minted PhD with a background
in artificial intelligence (AI), Hunter sought out career opportunities
that would apply his skills and give him a steady paycheck. He
joined the NIH’s National Library of Medicine (NLM) in March
1989 as one of its first computer scientists, during a time when NIH
was trying to strengthen its influence over the Human Genome
Project. Hunter began maintaining a database of AI researchers with
interests in molecular biology, and in 1991 he used this list to organ—
ize the first workshop that formed the basis of the Intelligent
Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) meeting. The official ‘first
annual’ ISMB conference took place in 1993 on the NIH grounds
and sold out almost instantly. Different universities in the US and
UK hosted the next several ISMB conferences, and Hunter
and others, including Russ Altman, Chris Rawlings, David Searls
and Jude Shavlik were the primary meeting organizers. Planning and
organizing each meeting presented unique challenges, but moving
money for the meeting between institutions became a particularly
cumbersome task.

 

The burgeoning popularity of the early ISMB conferences as well
as the financial and logistical challenges of organizing the confer—
ences compelled Hunter and his colleagues to consider establishing a
scientific society for those who used computation to investigate bio—
logical questions. At the ISMB 1996 conference in St. Louis, MO,
Hunter and members of the steering committees from prior ISMB
conferences met to discuss the possibilities of organizing a new sci—
entific society, and they voted on a board of directors, including
Hunter as president, to guide this effort (Ferguson and Morrison
McKay 2006 ). Hunter recalled, ‘I felt a great sense of obligation to
make the Society work. There were a growing number of people
coming to the field, and the conference was expanding pretty rap—
idly. I had never run an organization before, and was very concerned
about getting it right. There were also some political issues that I felt
I had to be very careful to get right. Researchers with a background
in computational complexity theory thought of themselves as quite
different from the ones who came from a background in AI. There
was some discussion by people who wanted to form a different soci—
ety, associated with the Research in Computational Molecular
Biology (RECOMB) conference. We had a long dinner on a Greek
beach at the ISMB 1997, which was the basis for working out an
agreement that kept the community whole’. The board agreed on a
mission statement for the nascent society at this marathon strategy
session in Greece. The original statement was, ‘The International

Society for Computational Biology is dedicated to advancing the sci—
entific understanding of living systems through computation; our em—
phasis is on the role of computing and informatics in advancing
molecular biology’, but the second phrase has been dropped to adapt
to the Society’s broader focus. The board agreed on the International
Society of Computational Biology as a name, and ISCB was officially
incorporated as a non—profit organization in 1997.Hunter faced some
unexpected challenges as president of the newly formed ISCB, includ—
ing the unforeseen difficulties of trying to find a bank that would ac—
cept a large check that was the underlying funding for this
organization. He was keenly aware that scientists with allegiances to
ISMB or to RECOMB, a competing conference, had to feel welcome
and appropriately represented by ISCB. Most surprisingly, he recalled,
‘I greatly underestimated the amount of time it would take to make it
all work. We had no staff, and everything was done by the executive
committee, so I put much more time into it than I thought I was going
to’. He remembered how computational biology and bioinformatics
were considered as peripheral and offbeat fields by many scientists at
the time of ISCB’s founding. ‘Hard, logical computer science was seen
as having no connection at all to wet, squishy biology’, he recounted.
‘When I mentioned “computational biology,” people couldn’t even
hear the words together, they would often say “confrontational biol—
ogy, what’s that?”’

ISCB has grown and evolved as a scientific society since its found—
ing, especially as computational biology and bioinformatics have
becoming increasingly vital components of biological research. He has

seen ISCB become a critical resource for facilitating interactions and
collaborations between scientists across fields, especially via ISMB
and its other conferences. ‘1 think my proudest achievement is that the
society is still going today’, Hunter said. ‘I booted it up in good
enough organizational and financial shape that it looks like it will
have a long life. I expect it will outlive me. It’s really an honor to have
created something of enduring value for so many people’.

Hunter envisions that ISCB will adapt and change in the future
in order to be of value to its membership. He said, ‘One interesting
possibility would be for ISCB to organize events and activities to
provide short—term training in informatics to biomedical researchers.
Conferences like VizBi do that very well for biological visualization,
and ISCB might be able to meet a need organizing similar confer—
ences or tutorials at non—bioinformatics meetings. Twenty years
from now I will be almost 75, so it will have to be the next gener—
ation to figure out how the Society evolves to stay relevant and
valuable’.

Abstract

Summary: In randomized clinical trials, identifying baseline genetic or genomic markers for
predicting subgroup treatment effects is of rising interest. Outcome—dependent sampling is often
employed for measuring markers. The R package TwoPhaselnd implements a number of efficient
statistical methods we developed for estimating subgroup treatment effects and gene—treatment
interactions, exploiting the gene—treatment independence dictated by randomization, including the
case—only estimator, the maximum estimated likelihood estimator and the semiparametric max—
imum likelihood estimator for parameters in a logistic model. For rare failure events subject to cen—
soring, we have proposed efficient augmented case—only designs, a variation of the case—cohort
design, to estimate genetic associations and subgroup treatment effects in a Cox regression model.
The R package is computationally scalable to genome—wide studies, as illustrated by an example
from Women’s Health Initiative.

Availability and Implementation: The R package TwoPhaselnd is available from http://cran.r—pro

1 Introduction

Depending on genetic background and clinical characteristics, in-
dividuals respond differently to treatment or prevention. In
randomized clinical trials, there is a rising interest in identifying
baseline biomarkers that predict subgroup or individual treatment
effects, for example pharmacogenenetics or pharmacogenomics
studies, that may lead to personalized or precision medicine. A
common design of such studies is to measure predictive biomarkers
of treatment efficacy from achieved specimens after trial comple-
tion (Simon et (11., 2009). The genetic or genomic markers are often
expensive to measure, particularly for genome-wide high-through-
put assays such as whole-genome sequencing. The outcome-
dependent sampling, such as case—control or case—cohort sampling
are widely used for cost efficiency in this type of retrospective
studies.

Efficient statistical methods have been developed for estimating
gene—treatment interaction and subgroup treatment effects for a
range of outcome-dependent sampling schemes, exploiting the gene—
treatment independence dictated by randomization (Dai et (11., 2009,
2012, 2014, 2016). The efficiency gain can be as much as 50%
when compared to approaches not using the gene—treatment inde-
pendence. For rare events often studied in prevention trials, the case-
only estimator has been advocated: biomarkers are measured only in
the cases, yet subgroup treatment effects and gene—treatment inter-
actions are estimated with the same efficiency as the full cohort ap-
proach where all participants are measured. For not-so-rare
dichotomized trial endpoints (for example cancer therapeutic trials)
and case—control sampling for biomarkers (Dai et (11., 2012, 2014),
semiparametric maximum likelihood estimators and maximum esti-
mated likelihood estimators have been developed with efficient algo-
rithms (Dai et (11., 2009). We recently proposed augmented case—

P—value, the q—q line is right in the diagonal direction, suggesting the
algorithm works well in estimation for all three methods. The first
two graphics in the lower panels of Figure 1D,E shows the estimated
variances of SNP—treatment interaction, using or without the inde—
pendence between treatment and the SNP, suggesting that using in—
dependence yields a much more precise estimates of interaction. The
last graph in the lower panel (Fig. 1F) shows the comparison of the
case—only estimator and the SPMLE estimator, suggesting the two
agrees well in efficiency of estimation since type II diabetes is rela—
tive rare in the WHI hormone trial.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Phenotypic information is important for the analysis of
the molecular mechanisms underlying disease. A formal ontological
representation of phenotypic information can help to identify,
interpret and infer phenotypic traits based on experimental findings.
The methods that are currently used to represent data and
information about phenotypes fail to make the semantics of the
phenotypic trait explicit and do not interoperate with ontologies of
anatomy and other domains. Therefore, valuable resources for the
analysis of phenotype studies remain unconnected and inaccessible
to automated analysis and reasoning.

Results: We provide a framework to formalize phenotypic
descriptions and make their semantics explicit. Based on this
formalization, we provide the means to integrate phenotypic
descriptions with ontologies of other domains, in particular anatomy
and physiology. We demonstrate how our framework leads to the
capability to represent disease phenotypes, perform powerful queries
that were not possible before and infer additional knowledge.

1 INTRODUCTION

Large-scale genomics research increasingly includes the collection
of phenotypic information to infer disease states from genetic
conditions. Similarly, evolutionary studies heavily rely on
phenotypic descriptions across species. Several biomedical
databases collect and organize phenotypic information (Bult et al.,
2008; Firth et al., 2009; The Flybase consortium, 1999). To
integrate this information across different domains and databases
and to communicate the data to the research community, phenotype
ontologies were developed which formalize the meaning of terms
used to Characterize phenotypes (Gkoutos et al., 2004b; Robinson
et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2004).

Ontologies are speciﬁcations of a conceptualization of a domain
(Gruber, 1993) and are used to make the meaning of terms in a
vocabulary explicit (Guarino, 1998) such that they can be used
for consistency veriﬁcation, information retrieval and knowledge
discovery. At least two kinds of phenotype ontologies can be
distinguished: ontologies in which each term contains one speciﬁc
phenotypic trait (Robinson et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2004), and
ontologies and methods that permit the composition of a term

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

through the combination of an entity and a quality (Gkoutos et al.,
2004a, b; Mungall et al., 2010). Each of these approaches describes
a phenotype through qualities that are attributes of an entity.
For example, a size of an arm would be described as a quality Size
which is the quality of Arm.

In addition to these qualities, phenotype ontologies contain Classes
describing absence and presence of parts, functions, dispositions and
processes, as well as abnormality. Currently, these features are also
represented as qualities and rarely further analyzed. In particular,
the attribution of qualities like Absent or Dysfunctional does not
yet enable inferences about the parts or ﬁinctions of an entity.
Consequently, these approaches fail to interoperate with anatomy or
physiology ontologies. If, however, the meaning of these qualities
would be made explicit and Classes like Absent or Dysﬁmctional
characterized in terms of the has-part and has-function relations,
information ﬂow between phenotype and anatomy or physiology
ontologies would be possible, thereby leading to a semantic
integration of these ontologies and the capability for expressive
queries.

As anatomy ontologies often represent canonical, prototypical
organisms, inconsistencies may arise when they are combined with
phenotype ontologies (Hoehndorf et al., 2007). For example, an
anatomy ontology may contain a statement that asserts that every
human has an appendix as part, while a phenotypic description
of a human may assert that this human has no appendix as part.
Because inconsistencies prevent query answering and semantic
interoperability, a framework for phenotypic descriptions must
accommodate statements about deviations from reference models
without leading to inconsistencies.

We provide a method to make the intended meaning of phenotypic
descriptions explicit and interoperable with anatomy and physiology
ontologies. For this purpose, we ﬁrst provide the means to
formalize phenotypic traits while reusing Classes and relations from
other ontologies. Based on this formalization, we describe how
to consistently integrate phenotypic descriptions with canonical
ontologies and demonstrate how our method leads to expressive and
ﬂexible descriptions of disease phenotypes as well as the possibility
for automated inference and knowledge discovery. We applied our
method to examples taken from phenotype ontologies and provide
an example ontology which is available from our project web site.

Our framework for formalizing phenotypic descriptions is based
on the Web Ontology Language (OWL; Motik et al., 2009). OWL
is based on an expressive, decidable fragment of ﬁrst-order logic
and provides the foundation for the Semantic Web. To maintain
compatibility with currently established methods for representing
phenotypes and reuse the data that has been annotated with it, we
also demonstrate an implementation in the OBO Flatﬁle Format.

Fig. 1. The ﬁrst distinction is drawn between phenes of objects and phenes of processes. We primarily classify phenes of objects into four main categories:

structural, functional, qualitative and participatory phenes. Under the structural phenes, we show possible further classiﬁcations based on the relations we use
in our method. Qualitative phenes can be further distinguished into those where only the quality is relevant and those where the quality’s value is considered.

2 SYSTEMS AND METHODS

2.1 Overview

An organism is composed of organs, cells and other structural components.
The variability of the structural components can be observed and described
with the EntityeQuality (EQ) representation based on the Phenotypic
Attribute and Trait Ontology (PATO; Gkoutos et al., 2004a; Mungall et al.,
2010). Beyond the structure of organisms and its variability, we can observe
processes in which the organism and its anatomical parts may participate.
These processes may lead to changes in the structure or its variability
in response to the organism’s requirements. Developmental processes and
functions such as growth and synaptic plasticity serve to change the
organisms” structure and consequently lead to new dispositions. Furthermore,
all living beings have to adapt to their environment and therefore expose
responses in terms of changes to their structure and functioning. Structure
and function form dual components (Hoehndorf et al., 2010a; Wright, 1973)
in a system that describes the complexity of the phenotypes.

Many aspects of this complex network of interdependencies can currently
be captured using biomedical ontologies. For example, the components
and parts of organisms are described in anatomy ontologies such as the
Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA; Rosse and Mejino, 2003) or the
cellular component branch of the Gene Ontology (GO; Ashburner et al.,
2000). Organismal, cellular and molecular processes are described in the
biological process branch of the GO, developmental anatomy ontologies are
available for various species (Bult et al., 2008; Tweedie et al., 2009) and
environmental features can be characterized with the Environment Ontology
(Environment Ontology Consortium, 2008).

An ontological framework for phenotypes should enable the description of
this variability and complexity, and interoperate with the existing ontologies
and resources that were developed for it. In particular, a framework
for representing phenotypes should enable the inference of consistent
dependencies between different aspects in this network of dependencies, and
provide for the detection of inconsistencies in the phenotypic description of
an organism.

We ﬁrst deﬁne a uniform framework for characterizing phenotypic
properties of entities. For this purpose, we introduce the concept of phene
that allows to make the semantics of an entity’s features explicit and
accessible to automated reasoning. As phenotypic characterizations are
usually done comparatively with respect to the features of another reference
entity, we show how to use the phene concept to facilitate interoperability
of phenotypic descriptions with reference ontologies in biomedicine. In
particular, we demonstrate how to formally represent and infer normality
and abnormality. Based on the development of our formal framework
for representing phenotypic information, we demonstrate how to apply it
to knowledge discovery and querying across the diversity of knowledge
resources containing phenotypic information.

2.2 Formalizing phenotypic traits

We deﬁne phene as a basic characteristics possessed by an organism. Phenes
are attributive entities which are existentially dependent on a bearer, and
phenes characterize the properties of their bearer. Therefore, we formally

deﬁne phenes as the properties that are possessed by ‘entities which are
Y”, and express Y as class-membership in description logic, or as a unary
predicates in ﬁrst-order logic. We call Y the deﬁning property of a phene.

The deﬁning property of a phene characterizes the phene’s bearer, and
therefore we can distinguish different kinds of phenes based on the relations
that are necessary to formulate this characteristic. For example, a class of
phenes, such as producing endorphines, refer to participation in processes
of a certain kind. A large portion of phenes refer to ontological qualities:
being cyanotic, being 7.5;tm in size. Further phenes are structural, such as
having or not having certain parts, refer to topology (being connected in a
certain way) or to dispositions (being able to hear). To analyze and distinguish
these differences, we derive a top-level classiﬁcation of phenes based on the
relations that are necessary to formulate their deﬁning properties. Figure 1
gives an overview of this top-level classiﬁcation.

2.2.] Structural phenes Structural phenes are based on the mereological
relation part-of. The deﬁning property of structural phenes is expressed using
the part-of or has-part relation. Examples of structural phenes are present
spleen and absent spleen which are deﬁned as phenes of things which have
(or do not have) a spleen as part:

Present_spleen equivalentTo:

phene—of some (has—part some Spleen)
Absent_spleen equivalentTo:

phene—of some (not has—part some Spleen)

The deﬁning property is has—part some Spleen and not
has—part some Spleen, and the instances of the deﬁning property
are entities that either have or do not have a spleen as part. Because our
deﬁnition of these phenes uses the has-part relation, we can combine
phenotypic information with anatomical information, thereby establishing
an informative link between both.

2.2.2 Qualitative phenes Another group of phenes represents ontological
qualities and we call them qualitative phenes. Qualities are related to
their bearer by the inheres-in relation and its inverse has-quality. We can
express qualitative phenes using our deﬁnition pattern in a similar way as
structural phenes: as phenes of things in which a certain quality inheres.
For example, the phene being cyanotic is represented as a phene of things
which have the quality (has-quality) cyanotic. We can further reﬁne this by
distinguishing qualities from their values and relate both used the value-of
and has-value relations. Then, being cyanotic is represented as a phene of
things that have a color within a certain value range.

2.2.3 Function and disposition phenes Another group ofphenes is related
to functions and disposition of entities, and can be expressed using the
has-function. function-of, has-disposition and disposition-of relations. We
call these dispositional phenes. Intuitively, functions of biological entities
establish the reason (or cause) that an entity exists (Wright, 1973) while
their dispositions determine their capabilities and potentials (Lewis, 1997).
For example, the endocrine pancreatic cells have a function to produce
insulin, and normally have a disposition to produce insulin.

112 /3.to's[Bumo[p.IOJxosotwutJOJutotq”:duq utori papeolumoq

9103 ‘{g isnﬁnv 110::

R.Hoehndorf et al.

 

In many cases, neither functions nor dispositions are explicitly included
in ontologies, but rather the processes that realize these functions or
dispositions. Therefore, dispositional phenes will often be represented
using the has-function-realized-by or has-disposition-realized-by design
patterns (Hoehndorf et al., 2010a). Using these, a relation between a class C
and a class of processes P is established such that every instance of C has a
function (or disposition) that is only realized by processes of the kind P. For
example, the endocrine pancreatic cells have a function to produce insulin
which is realized through insulin production processes. The processes that
result from the realizations of functions are called ﬁtnctionings (Johansson,
2004)

2.2.4 Functionings and processes An organism or anatomical structure
may participate in certain processes, for example in physiological, metabolic
or developmental processes, or in the organism’s activities. To participate in
these processes is a participatory phene. Participatory phenes are represented
with the participates-in and has-participant relations. Furthermore, we
can distinguish different modes of participation for a phene of a process
participant and thus determine how an entity participates in a process.
We represent these phenes with the relation plays-processual-role (Loebe.
2005). For example, the sinoatrial nodes participate in blood pumping
processes and play the processual role of an initiator of the rhythmic
excitation of the heart muscle.

Apart from the phenes of process participants, we can distinguish a second
kind of phene which represents characteristics of the processes themselves.
We call this kind the process phenes, and they include characteristics of
physiological processes, metabolic processes, biological pathways, chemical
reactions and their parts. These processes can have attributes such as duration
or a heart beat rate, they can have parts or participants. Although some aspects
of our classiﬁcation of phenes can also be applied to process phenes, we leave
a detailed classiﬁcation of process phenes as subject to future work.

2.2.5 The logic of phenes

Axioms for classes and relations: phenes are related to their bearers using
the phene-of and has-phene relations. Because phenes are existentially
dependent on their bearer, phenes are always the phene-of some entity.
Furthermore, phene-of is functional, i.e. a phene belongs to at most one
entity. Therefore, the following restriction holds for the class Phene:

Phene subClassOf: phene—of exactly 1 Thing

The domain of the phene-of relation is the class Phene, while the range
is owl :Thing, i.e. the class of all things. The relation has-phene is the
inverse of the phene-of relation, i.e. whenever an individual x is the phene-
of an individual y, then y stands in the has-phene relation to x. Because
phene-of is functional, and has-phene is inverse functional.

Applying phenes to entities. a particular class of phenes P is deﬁned with
respect to a deﬁning property Y of its bearers. Therefore, the deﬁnition pattern
for phenes is

P subClassOf: phene—of some Y
or
P equivalentTo: phene—of some Y

Because the phene-of relation is functional and the has-phene relation
inverse functional, the following is true: if an individual i is the bearer of a
phene of the kind P, i is an instance of Y.

For example, we have deﬁned the phene Absent spleen as the phene of
things that have no Spleen as part. Based on this phene, we can deﬁne a class
of Human without spleen as:

Human_without_spleen equivalentTo:
Human and has—phene some Absent_spleen

Based on the inference rules for OWL, we can show that this deﬁnition is
equivalent to

Human_without_spleen equivalentTo:
Human and has—phene some (phene—of some
(not has—part some Spleen))

and due to the functionality of phene-of and the inverse functionality of
has-phene, this is equivalent to

Human_without_spleen equivalentTo:
Human and (not has—part some Spleen)

Composing complex phenes: besides applying phenes to entities, we can
introduce intersections and unions of phenes to form complex phenes. Due
to the axioms for the phene-of and has-phene relations, intersections and
unions of phenes correspond to intersections and unions of the deﬁning
properties of these phenes: when the class of phenes P1 is based on the
deﬁning property Y1, and P2 based on Y2, then the complex phene P1 and
P2 is based on the deﬁning property Y1 and Y2.

For example, in addition to the Absent spleen phene we deﬁne Absent
kidney similar toAbsent spleen. Then, we can deﬁne a complex pheneAbsent
spleen and absent kidney (ASAK):

ASAK equivalentTo: Absent_spleen and Absent_kidney
Through inference, we can show that this deﬁnition is equivalent to

ASAK equivalentTo:
phene—of some (not has—part some Spleen)
and
phene—of some (not has—part some Kidney)

and due to the functionality of the phene-of relation, this is equivalent to

ASAK equivalentTo: phene—of some
((not has—part some Spleen)
and
(not has—part some Kidney))

The deﬁning property of ASAK is not deﬁned based on either of the relations
in our ontology ofphenes, and therefore it is not a primitive phene. However,
through inference we can show that ASAK becomes a subclass both of Absent
spleen and Absent kidney.
Reasoning with phenes: phenes can be used to infer additional knowledge
and verify consistency. The simplest case is a contradictory application of
phenes, e.g. an individual organism with both the Absent spleen and Present
spleen phene. Due to the deﬁnition of both phenes, such an assertion would
be inconsistent and can be automatically detected using automated inference.
More importantly, phenes can make use of the information in ontologies
to infer that other phenes must hold as well. For example, when integrated
with an anatomy ontology like the FMA. the phene Absent spleen entails the
Absent serosa of spleen phene, because Serosa of spleen (FMA : l 5 84 8) must
be a part-of some Spleen according to the FMA. Similar entailments hold
for relations between anatomical entities and their functions. For example, if
endocrine pancreatic cells are the only cells with a function to secrete insulin,
their absence can entail the absence of insulin secretion.

2.3 Phenes and comparative descriptions

Phenes are properties of entities and phenes whose deﬁning property involves
negation can be attributes of a large number of entities. Therefore, phenes
alone should rarely be used to describe the set of phenotypic characteristics
of an organism.

As phenotypic descriptions are often comparative statements with respect
to a reference model, either a model of normality, a control group, another
organism or similar, we can exploit these descriptions to record phenes that
characterize deviations from such a reference model. In particular, we show
how to integrate phenes with canonical ontologies, although other artifacts
can serve as reference models as well.

Phenotype and anatomy ontologies

 

2.3.1 Interoperability with canonical ontologies Canonical ontologies are
those that serve as reference models within their domain and characterize
prototypical, idealized entities (Smith and Rosse, 2004). Phenotypic
descriptions and representations should interoperate with such resources and
use them to infer knowledge and verify consistency.

When phenes are combined with canonical ontologies, inconsistencies and
unsatisﬁable classes may arise (Hoehndorf et al., 2007). For example, the
FMA states that every Human has a Spleen as part. Characterizing an instance
of Human h with the Absent spleen phene will lead to an inconsistency: as an
instance of Human, h must stand in the has-part relation to some instance
of Spleen; because h has a phene of the Absent spleen type, h must not have
an instance of Spleen as part.

For the purpose of integrating canonical ontologies and the phene method,
we restructure canonical ontologies to explicitly state that they describe only
canonical entities. For example, instead of stating that every human has a
spleen as part, we restructure the corresponding anatomy ontology to state
that every canonical human has some canonical spleen as part.

For phenotypic descriptions, we need to describe non-canonicity in a
ﬂexible way, and we have at least two choices: the non-canonicity of the
spleen could either be the absence of a canonical spleen or the presence of
a non-canonical spleen. The ﬁrst choice is more general, as it allows both
for the presence of a non-canonical spleen as well as for the absence of the
spleen. Therefore, we adopt this option and deﬁne a non-canonicity of the
spleen as a phene of things that have no canonical spleen as part. A non-
canonicity is different from an absence of the spleen, which is a phene of
things which have no spleen as part, whether canonical or not. An absence
of the spleen automatically becomes a subcategory of a non-canonicity of
the spleen according to this deﬁnition.

Formally, we introduce two new unary predicates called C and NC (for
canonical and non-canonical, respectively). In description logics, both C
and NC are classes. C and NC are disjoint and exhaustive, i.e. everything is
either C or NC but not both. Based on these classes, we restructure canonical
ontologies such that all occurrences of class symbols X are replaced with
X and C. Biomedical ontologies consist to a large portion of statements
of the kind X subClassOf: R some Y (Horrocks, 2007). Assertions
of this kind are consequently replaced with X and C subClassOf : R
some (Y and C) . For example, the FMA statement that all Humans have
a Spleen as part (Human subClassOf: has—part some Spleen)
is replaced by ‘all canonical humans have a canonical spleen as part” (Human
and C subClassOf: has—part some (C and Spleen) ). This
replacement can be performed automatically using the OWLDEF method
(Hoehndorf et al., 2010b).

Based on these deﬁnitions, we can formally deﬁne a non-canonicity of
the spleen (NCOS):

NCOS EquivalentTo: phene—of some (not has—part some
(Spleen and C))

Following our pattern, we can deﬁne a human with an NCOS as

NCOS—Human EquivalentTo: Human and hasPhene
some NCOS

from which we derive, using deductive reasoning in OWL, that an
NCOSHuman has no canonical spleen as part. We can also prove that a
NCOSHuman is a subclass of a non-canonical human, i.e. of Human and
NC, because canonical humans must have a canonical spleen as part.

We demonstrate these features in an OWL ontology that formalizes
abnormality and absence of the appendix, liver and ﬁ-cells. The
demonstration ontology is available from our project website.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

A large portion of our method is based on description logic and
the Web Ontology Language (OWL) (W3C OWL Working Group,

2009). Using OWL has the advantage that the myriad of software
tools, methods and libraries that have been developed for the
Semantic Web can be reused with the method. In particular, OWL
has an explicit semantics that makes it amenable for automated
reasoning. However, many biomedical ontologies are developed
using the OBO Flatﬁle Format (Horrocks, 2007). For our method
to be successful, we provide an implementation in the OBO Flatﬁle
Format that is compatible with the description logic treatment of
phenes and phenotypes put forward in this manuscript. For this
purpose, we use the OWLDEF method (Hoehndorf et al., 2010b) to
provide OWL deﬁnitions for relations in the OBO Flatﬁle Format.
These relations follow our top-level ontology of phenes and are
listed in Table 1.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Towards canonical disease phenotypes

We envision one application of our method to provide a means
for representing canonical disease states. For this purpose, we
introduce the notion of canonical disease phenotype: a complex
phene which is the combination of those phenes that constitute the
idealized or canonical form of a disease. Some of the phenes in a
disease phenotype are dispositional, while others relate to qualities,
absence or presence of body parts and participation in physiological
processes.

To Characterize disease phenotypes ﬁirther and utilize the existing
ontologies for automated inferences and knowledge discovery,
several domains have yet to be covered by canonical ontologies so
that they can serve as a bridge that links existing resources. Table 2
provides an overview of available and missing resources and their
relation to our method.

To infer and reason over developmental abnormalities, a
developmental anatomy must be available. There are developmental
anatomies for several model organisms (Segerdell et al., 2008;
Tweedie et al., 2009). To describe human developmental defects,
a human developmental anatomy ontology integrated with the FMA
would be beneﬁcial as reference model on which deviations can
be based. Similarly, to describe missing, abnormal or additional
dispositions and functions, a ﬁinctional anatomy ontology should
be developed. Although there are approaches to construct such
a resource (Hoehndorf et al., 2010a; Johansson et al., 2005), no
comprehensive ontological resource for anatomical ﬁinctions has
been developed so far. Similarly, almost no ontologies for canonical
physiology are currently available.

To describe qualitative phenes such as those relating to color or
size, qualitative descriptions can be added to anatomy ontologies.
For this purpose, it is important to use ranges of values for qualities,
because values for qualities are often highly variable. Using the
phene method, it would further be beneﬁcial to describe the qualities
of the wild type or control group in genetic experiments. This has
the additional beneﬁt of providing additional documentation to an
experiment. Such a documentation can increase the interoperability
with ontologies of investigations such as the Ontology of Biomedical
Investigations (OBI; Courtot et al., 2008).

The method we propose can be used to represent and infer
dependencies between phenotypic traits and verify the consistency
of descriptions of phenotypes. For example, the absence of liver cells
entails that they cannot have qualities or functions, because both

qualities and functions are dependent on a bearer. Consequently,
physiological processes that rely on liver cells’ functionings will be
impaired. Similarly, the absence of insulin producing f3 cells will
prevent them from exerting their function, leading to a disruption in
glucose metabolism and consequently an increased concentration of
glucose in the blood. Because phenes make the semantics behind

phenotypic traits explicit, these interrelations can be asserted or
inferred, depending on the information present in the corresponding
canonical ontologies. In addition, if f3 cells are absent, they may
not be increased in size or have dispositions, and making such an
assertion would lead to an inconsistency that can be automatically

Phenotype and anatomy ontologies

 

Although the phene method intends to provide a semantic
framework for representing phenotypic information, it can also
be applied to other domains such as representing Clinical
information. In particular, canonical disease phenotypes are similar
to canonical conceptual graphs which are used in the Canon
Group’s model to represent prototypical Clinical ﬁndings (Friedman
et al., 1995). Consequently, the phene method is currently being
applied to represent the canonical disease phenotypes of primary
immunodeﬁciency diseases in the PID Ontology (Adams et al.,
2010).

4.2 Phenes and the EQ formalism

The phene method can provide a semantics for the Entity-Quality
(EQ) formalism and make it amenable to automated reasoning. EQ
is currently widely used to annotate and formalize phenotypes and
phenotypic descriptions (Mungall et al., 2010), and its formalization
states that an EQ statement is equivalent to a Quality (Q) that
inheres-in an Entity (E) (Mungall, 2007). This approach is strictly
weaker than our method and corresponds to the use of the relation
CC-pheneOf—has-quality (Table 1) in our method.

The currently employed semantics for EQ has several
shortcomings. First, it is based on the assumption that phenotypic
Characters are qualities. Qualities do not allow to infer ﬁlrther
information about other kinds of entities such as parts, functions
and processes, and therefore the EQ semantics limits interoperability
with other ontologies. For example, having a quality Lacks
all parts of type (PATO:0002000) or Lacks function of type
(PATO : O O O l 6 4 l) formally conveys no information about the parts
or ﬁinctions of an entity. Even more problematic is the use of
the towards relation to specify the kind of entity that is absent:
in its currently used semantics (Horrocks, 2007), Absent spleen
is interpreted as a Lacks all parts of type quality that is directed
towards some Spleen. In this statement, towards is used in an
existential restriction over Spleen, thereby leading to the inference
that an instance of Spleen must exist in order to be absent.

The second shortcoming of EQ relates to the combination
of qualities, which is important to describe complex phenotypic
Characteristics or disease phenotypes. In EQ, qualities from PATO
are Characteristics such as color or length, and intersections of color
and length would be qualities which are both a color and a length
at the same time. Such qualities do not exist in the domain of
phenotypes. However, combined qualities such as Absent spleen and
absent kidney are intended to be the qualities of organisms that have
both an absent spleen and an absent kidney.

The method we propose overcomes these shortcomings by
explicitly deﬁning phenotypic Characteristics using relations and
Classes from other ontologies. In addition, we demonstrated how
phenes can be combined through intersections to form complex
phenes.

4.3 Normality and abnormality

Being normal and being canonical are sometimes used
synonymously, but we make a distinction between both because
canonicity does not always coincide with normality. For example,
although the canonical human body represented by the FMA is both
male and female (in virtue of having both ovaries and testes as
part), normal humans are either male or female, but not both. Being
both male and female would instead be considered to be abnormal.

Additionally, in experiments, normal is deﬁned with respect to a
control group of organisms, and not directly based on a canonical
ontologies. Also, normal affects all phenes, while canonicity is often
restricted to structure, ﬁinction and physiology. Consequently, a
tail size of a mouse may be within a certain normal range within
a population of mice, abnormal within another population, and
not considered in a canonical ontology at all. The reason is that
normal and abnormal are statistical, empirical measures, while
canonical and non-canonical are based on prototypical idealizations
constructed by humans.

Our method is neutral with respect to these distinctions. We could
introduce another set of predicates, Normal and Abnormal, both
of which are neither a sub- nor a super-Class of C and NC. Being
Normal would, for example, entail being either male or female, but
not both. In an ontology of Normal humans, sex would either not be
considered (when the ontology is open or incomplete in this aspect),
or two kinds of humans would be distinguished based on their sex.

An important application is the speciﬁcation of Normal phenes of
organisms within the context of an experiment. These phenes can
include qualities such as fur color, tail size or similar, i.e. the phenes
that are measured within an experiment protocol. Then, an organism
or anatomical part of the organism is Abnormal if it lies outside the
range of values that is considered normal. As for canonical and non-
canonical entities, a phene P is an abnormality with respect to the
Normal phene Q if having the phene P implies not having Q.

4.4 Future research

To integrate phenotype and canonical ontologies, we rely on
introducing explicit Classes for canonicity and non-canonicity.
This permits a consistent integration of these ontologies, but has
some drawbacks. In particular, when an organism has a single
deviation from its canonical form, the organism is non-canonical and
inferences from assertions in canonical ontologies cannot be drawn
anymore. To prevent this issue, more distinctions than canonical
versus non-canonical can be introduced (Rector, 2004). In the future,
we plan to integrate our method of representing phenotypes in a
framework that supports default reasoning (Hoehndorf et al., 2007).

4.5 Conclusions

We developed a method to represent phenotypic information in
ontologies such that the semantics is made explicit. For this purpose,
we introduce a category of phenes. Phenes are basic observable
features of organisms which are deﬁned with respect to a deﬁning
property. Deﬁning properties can include absence or presence of
parts or functions. This deﬁning property is the feature of phenes
that allows to make their semantics explicit and facilitate information
ﬂow with other ontologies based on the use of common relations.
Using our method to represent phenotypic information, we
suggest a new top-level Classiﬁcation of phenotypic Characteristics,
based on the relations used in the deﬁning properties of the phenes.
The main distinction is between phenes of processes and phenes of
objects. Those of objects are ﬁlrther distinguished into structural,
qualitative, ﬁinctional and participatory phenes. The ﬁrst kind
pertain to presence or absence of parts, the second to having qualities
or values of qualities within certain ranges. Functional phenes
Characterize the ﬁinctionality or dysfunctionality of organisms or
their parts. Participatory phenes Characterize the participation and
the mode of participation of organisms and their parts in processes.

The formal representation of phenotypic information permits
the integration of canonical ontologies with phenotype ontologies.
For this purpose, canonical ontologies must be re-interpreted as
explicitly referring to canonical entities, while phenotype ontologies
can refer to either the canonical, the non-canonical or both kinds
of entities. This simple restructuring, which can be hidden from
ontology users, together with our proposed method enables the
representation of canonical disease phenotypes as a means for
characterizing disease states.

Altogether, we provide an explicit and formal framework
for representing phenotypes that is applicable within biomedical
ontologies for reasoning, answering queries and integrating
knowledge about domains ranging from molecular biology to
medicine. This enables the use of knowledge-based methods to
infer, structure, classify and query information about disease and
phenotype, thereby facilitating translational research and medicine.

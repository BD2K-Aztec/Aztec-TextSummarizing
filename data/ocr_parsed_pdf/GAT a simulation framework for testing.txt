GAT

 

simulation. The simplest workspace contains the full
genome assembly. In this example, the analysis should be
restricted to only repeat—free regions, as only these are re—
liably mappable by short read data and thus could contain
ChIP—Seq intervals. Again, appropriate bed—formatted files
are available from the UCSC Genome Browser.

By default, the randomization procedure accounts for differ—
ences among chromosomes; for example, the X chromosome
contains many sequence features that are atypical of autosomes.
In addition to chromosome identity, local genomic G+ C con—
tent is another common confounding factor. For example, G + C
content might cause experimental biases in sequencing and
hybridization protocols, while it is also a correlate of gene density
(Lander et al., 2001). To correct for G + C content, an optional
bed—formatted ﬁle with the isochore structure of the genome can
be supplied. GAT will then normalize by isochore and by
chromosome. Here, isochores are discretized, for example, the
genome is partitioned into windows falling into eight bins of
different regional G+ C content.

2.2 Output

In the aforementioned example, GAT will compute the overlap
of ChIP—Seq binding events and DNaseI—hypersensitive sites.
GAT will also estimate if the overlap is larger or smaller than
expected by chance and will provide an empirical P—value of the
statistical signiﬁcance. If multiple ChIP—Seq experiments or mul—
tiple annotations have been submitted, GAT will compute the
overlap for each combination of experiment and annotation and
will estimate its signiﬁcance. Storey’s q—value (Storey and
Tibshirani, 2003) or the BenjaminiiHochberg method
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) is used to control for multiple
testing using a False discovery rate (FDR) procedure.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

3.1 Overview

GAT is a python script (http://python.org) requiring only
common and freely available numerical and scientiﬁc libraries.
The memory and time—critical parts are implemented in cython
(http://cython.org). It requires two collections of genomic inter—
vals: Segments (S) and Annotations (A). Each collection can con—
tain one or more lists of genomic intervals ($1, $2,. . . ,Sm; A1,
A2, . . . ,A"). Intervals within a list of genomic intervals are
required to be non—overlapping, and any overlapping intervals
within S or A are merged prior to analysis. In addition, GAT
requires a Workspace W describing the part of the genome ac—
cessible to the simulation. The analysis proceeds as follows. For
each pair of interval lists Sx and Ay (x e{1,... ,m},
y e {1 , . . . ,n}), GAT computes the overlap between the intervals
in Sx and Ay within workspace W: observedzleﬂAyﬂ W|.
|Here,| is the overlap operator and defaults to the number of
nucleotides overlapping, but other operators (such as the
number of segments) can be used. GAT subsequently creates
randomly placed intervals in the genome with the same size dis—
tribution of Sx within the workspace W. See below for simulation
details. The overlap between each simulated set and Ay is re—
corded. The average over all simulations represents the expected

overlap. GAT reports the fold enrichment as the ratio of observed
and expected overlap and associates an empirical P—value with it.
GAT’s runtime and memory usage scale linearly with the
number of simulations and the number and size of the genomic
interval sets S, A and W.

3.2 Sampling method

The sampling method creates a list R of randomly placed inter—
vals from an interval list Sx within a workspace W. The sampling
is done on a per—chromosome basis. For each chromosome c,
randomly placed intervals are created by a two—step procedure:

(1) Select an interval size from the empirical interval size dis—
tribution SW.

(2) Select a position within the workspace WC.

Sampled intervals are added to Rt. until exactly the same
number of nucleotides are in R(. as are in S“. For reasons of
performance, intervals are initially sampled without checking for
overlap. Overlaps and overshoot are subsequently resolved in an
iterative procedure once the sampled number of nucleotides ap—
proximates the target number.

The current sampling protocol is restricted to non—overlapping
single segment intervals. Although amenable to many genomic
features, it notably leaves discontinuous genomic segments, such
as transcripts, untreated.

3.3 Isochores

Isochores are deﬁned within GAT as chromosomal segments
within a workspace. For each isochore i, the workspace W is
subdivided into a workspace W,-= Wﬂli. The sampling is
performed separately for each W,- and samples combined at the
end. Isochores are thus treated in an equivalent manner to
chromosomes. Isochores can be defined by G+ C content, but
can reﬂect any segmentation of the genome, such as chromatin
marks.

4 CONCLUSIONS

GAT provides critical functionality for genomic analyses. By
using standard BED files, it may be used alongside major data
resources, such as the UCSC Genome Browser and Galaxy
(Giardine et al., 2005). GAT can be used in a similar context
to GREAT (McLean et al., 2010) and other tools, but can ad—
dress a more diverse range of questions because of its simulation
approach that takes into account both segment and annotation
size distributions.

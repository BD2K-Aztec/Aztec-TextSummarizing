miMsg-miR target enrichment using expression data

 

mRNA, inferring power by detecting patterns over multiple bio—
logical samples. In recent literature, various other computational
methods have been applied to matched mRNA and miR expres—
sion data including regression, correlation analysis and Bayesian
learning algorithms [detailed comparison and review of previously
published related methods is provided in Supplementary data A
and (Barbato et al., 2009)]. In comparison, miMsg is independent
of the methods used to measure expression levels and the statis—
tical properties of the data. It also only needs a minimal number of
user—deﬁned parameters and has built—in quality control. Finally,
it yields a result that is directly related to the observed expression
patterns and also supplies a visualization tool for individual inter—
actions. miMsg is extensively benchmarked against other methods
using 16 different (sub)sets of cancer—related expression data.
Benchmarking shows that non—parametric correlation methods
are inferior to the other algorithms tested. For the remaining al—
gorithms, results vary strongly depending on the dataset, and
overlap is minimal, identifying miMsg as a valuable alternative.
As a proof of principle, miMsg is applied to germ cell tumor
(GCT) data, investigating mRNA degradation, as most miR
have an inhibitory effect on mRNA/protein levels. In this deregu—
lated (cancer) context, miMsg identiﬁed validated relevant inter—
actions and miRs/mRNAs.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

2.1 Biological samples, expression proﬁling, data
normalization and statistics

The following matched GCT samples were included: ﬁve sper—
matocytic seminomas (SS, type III GCT), three seminomas (SE,
type II GCT) and three embryonal carcinomas (EC, type II
GCT) (Oosterhuis and Looijenga, 2005). mRNA expression
data (Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array) was acquired,
pre—processed and normalized as described in (Looijenga et al.,
2006). Matched miR expression data (multiplex qPCR, Applied
Biosystems) were acquired as described in Supplementary Data
M. Raw Ct values were normalized to RNU6b (results main text,
Supplementary Table S1) or their global average [(Mestdagh
et al., 2009), Supplementary Table S2, significant overlap with
RNU6b—based normalization (30% overlap, P< 0.01 based on
simulation)]. Unless speciﬁed otherwise, a t—test was used to com—
pare groups (Excel 2010/Matlab 2012a).

2.2 Annotation and target prediction matching

mRNA target predictions were downloaded from TargetScan’s
Web site (conserved miR families). The most recent annotation
ﬁles for the Affymetrix GeneChip HG—Ul33—Plus2 were down—
loaded from the manufacturer’s website. Data were carefully
parsed to fit the miMsg format (Supplementary Data B). miR
annotations were split and matched on miR family, class and
member separately to prevent missed matches. Gene symbols
were used to merge Affymetrix probe annotations with
TargetScan‘s predictions. Only predictions for humans were
included (speciesID = 9606) and only probes marked as speciﬁc
for one transcript were selected (sufﬁx ‘_at’). In the end, 37 956
mRNA probes and 293 miRs were available for analysis. Of
these, 5919 mRNA probes and 148 miRs were predicted to inter—
act (inhibition, 56 262 interactions, Table 1).

3 ALGORITHM

miMsg uses miRNA/mRNA expression and publicly available
databases with predicted interactions to enrich miRimRNA
interactions within a speciﬁc biological context. The miMsg
algorithm is based on the dogma that low mRNA target levels
as a result of degradation are detectable in real targets of a spe—
ciﬁc miR and are absent in non—interacting predicted targets.
miMsg is preeminently applicable to miRimRNA interactions
because the relevance of miRimRNA interactions in a biologic—
ally coherent set of samples depends on how the samples inter—
relate (i.e. ranking) rather than individual expression levels. In an
ideal interaction proﬁle, high expression of a miR in a tissue
should be coupled with low mRNA expression. By observing
this over multiple tissues, miMsg creates a combined ranking
profile of miR/mRNA expression for each interaction
(RR, Fig. l).

The output of the miMsg algorithm is straightforward
and focuses on biological interpretation. It detects inter—
actions with similar or inverse RR depending on the predicted
functional relation. The algorithm computes only three scores
for each interaction. These are intuitively related to the observed
RR and describe the quality and significance of the deviation
from the ideal interaction proﬁle. These scores are used to iden—
tify relevant and significant patterns, which can be further
studied.

3.1 Definitions

As explained in Figure 1A, the miMsg algorithm uses two
matched sets of expression data: A and B. CC contains the
hypothesized interactions between A and B and their direction
(inhibition for miRimRNA interactions). The RR of the expres—
sion levels is presented in RRj for each interaction j and used to
calculate the following quantities: (i) sj as an estimate for the
number of misplacements in RRj (Deﬁnition 1), (ii) oi as a
measure for the magnitude of these misplacements (Deﬁnition
2) and (iii) Xi (effect size), which combines the Si and oj
(Deﬁnition 3). Also, associated levels of (empirically derived)
signiﬁcance and false discovery rate (FDR) are presented.
Next, these quantities are formally defined (also see
Supplementary Data BiE).

Let n denote the total number of interactions between the two
datasets and m the total number of biological samples per inter—
action. Furthermore, let j=1,...,n denote the interaction and
i = I, . . ., m the biological sample.

DEFINITION l: s] (RELATIVE NUMBER OF MISPLACEMENTS). The rela-
tive number of misplacements e,- is defined as follows:

8,_ Ill}
./_(m_1)

 

e[01]

where I/IJ- : 0,1, . . ., m—I denotes the number of misplacements in the
RR of interaction j involving m samples. A misplacement is defined
as a difference between adjacent ranks being unequal to I , i.e.
ordering differs from ideal profile. (Supplementary Data D).

The relative number of misplacements alone is an incomplete
measure for how well the profile in RRj correlates to the ideal
profile. The magnitude of the difference between adjacent ranks
is important as well. Small differences between adjacent ranks

(small misplacements) are considered less serious than larger
ones (Fig. 1D). Therefore, consider the following measure for
the magnitude of the misplacements in RRj.

DEFINITION 2: a] (MAGNITUDE OF MISPLACEMENTS). The relative
magnitude of the misplacements 0,, measured by its relative vari—
ance, is defined as follows:

a, : ZiiIliRR/l i+1 — RR/J — 1|

‘1 floor(”’%) 6 [0 1]
where RR”- denotes the ith biological sample in the jth interaction,
and floor( m2 /2 ) is the maximum obtainable variance in a RR con—
taining m biological samples.

To quantify the combined effect of the number and magni—
tude of the misplacements, a combined score (effect size) is
deﬁned.

DEFINITION 3: AJ (COMBINED EFFECT SIZE). The number and mag—
nitude of misplacements (Definition 1, 2 ) are combined in A,- using
the following equation:

M=$i+G/—(8./‘Uj)€[0 1]

A is a monotonically increasing function of s and a, which
approaches zero if and only if both 8 and o approach zero
(s:[0 l] and o:[0 1]). It is a measure for the combined
effect size of s and o and is used to easily rank selected inter—
actions. Low values of A indicate a better match to the ideal RR
(Fig. 1D).

Finally, a statistical test is required to show relevance and
statistical signiﬁcance of the scores.

3.1.1. Significance and relevance The ﬁnal steps of the algo—
rithm determine (i) which interaction patterns are statistically
unlikely to occur by chance and (ii) which values of A should
be considered relevant (2 sufﬁciently low) (Fig. 1C). These
independent steps will be discussed below.

3.1.1.1 Significance In the preceding computations, the abso—
lute values of s, o and A that result for each interaction may be
coincidental. Hence, a measure of statistical signiﬁcance is
required. As no a priori knowledge about the statistical proper—
ties of the data is present, an empirically derived 2D cumulative

distribution function (cdf) is generated to assess the probability
of coincidental (s, a) combinations. This cdf is iteratively
approximated using permuted (shufﬂed) versions of the original
expression data. After each iteration, the cdf is evaluated at all
possible combinations (8k, om) present in the real data,
k: 1,2, . . .,K and m=1,2,...,M. This yields a cdf ,0(8, 0) that
can be compared between iterations at (s, a). The process of
adding (8, a) combinations from permuted data is repeated
until the difference between the current and previous iteration
is neglectable (i.e. <tol). This difference is deﬁned as the relative
root mean square error (rrs):

 

215:1 2%:l(pi(8ka 0m) — ,01'71(8k, a,,,))2
K M
216:1 Zm:l 1012(810 Um)

 

rr8,~ 2

After convergence, the resulting pdeﬁs, a) is evaluated at
all combinations from the real data (8k, am) to assess their re—
spective P—values (Supplementary Data E). pdef(s, a) is uniquely
generated for each group of interactions with the same number
of unique biological samples, as this number deﬁnes the theor—
etical variability of s and o [i.e. the shape of pdef(s, 0)].
(Supplementary Data F for more information about repetitive
values.) Formally, an interaction is deemed signiﬁcant if the fol—
lowing holds.

DEFINITION 4: STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. Consider the jth inter—
action, the corresponding measures 8_, and q,- (Definition 1, 2 )
and a user—defined level of significance at. Moreover, consider the
cdf pulp/{8,0} obtained using the procedure discussed in Section
3.1.1.]. Then, the jth interaction is defined to be significant 
[Mg/(8,0) S 0!-

3.1.1.2 Relevance Apart from the significance of an inter—
action pattern, it is required to determine which values of A
should be considered low enough (i.e. relevant). High values of
A might still be statistically signiﬁcant, but do not constitute
relevant interaction patterns. By iteratively using permuted
expression data as input for miMsg, a cdf of A is generated,
denoted by 1(A) (analogous to 3.1.1.1). Using ‘17, the FDR for
all signiﬁcant values of A is determined. The researcher can
determine a maximal acceptable FDR (B, usually§1%/5%).

Motivation: Selection of a high fraction (2 high number) of interactions is not feasible when applying the
results to research. In addition, if validated interactions are active in the studied tissues, there should be a
higher fraction of validated interactions in the selected interactions as compared with the complete dataset.

Result: Different algorithms select constant fractions from almost all datasets. LASSO selects ca. 50% of all
interactions; the other algorithms select %5%. Enrichment for validated interactions varies greatly between
datasets with no clear trend toward one optimal algorithm (correlation 2 worst). In the large datasets (GCT
and MM), miMsg outperforms the other algorithms by achieving 37% and 33% enrichment for validated
interactions (at 5 0.05, FDR 5 0.05).

Motivation: Unpermuted data in general should perform better than random data. Also, validated inter-
actions should outperform permuted data (ROC analysis).

Result: The total set of (validated) interactions most likely contains a high number of not interacting miRi
mRNA pairs/validated interactions that are not active. These are not expected to perform better than
random data. For most datasets, the algorithms therefore have difﬁculty outperforming permuted data
when considering all (validated) interactions. GenmiR performs well on some datasets followed by
miMsg; correlation analyses show the worst overall performance. When only the selected interactions are
considered LASSO, miMsg and to a lesser extend GenmiR perform much better in assigning higher scores to
unpermuted data and validated interactions.

Motivation: Algorithms using different approaches, but identifying many of the same interactions might be
more trustworthy.

Results: There is limited overlap between the interactions selected by the various algorithms even when only
good scoring interactions (top-100 or less) are considered. Spearman and Kendall overlap ca. 100% because
of high similarity in methodology.

Motivation: The size of the dataset and the fraction of validated interactions might inﬂuence performance of
the algorithms.

Results: For all algorithms, performance does not consistently improve when using smaller random subsets
with a higher fraction of validated interactions.

Motivation: Pre-selection of relevant interactions based on (gene) expression/validated interactions might
inﬂuence performance of the algorithms.

Results: For all algorithms, performance does not consistently improve when using pre-selected/validated
only sets of interactions.

5 DISCUSSION

5.1 miMsg: considerations (input and application)

miRs simultaneously, independent of miR/mRNA interaction.
Multiple samples per cluster are required to reduce this non—spe—
ciﬁc effect.

Predicted interactions. A sensible trusted set of predicted inter—
actions is a requirement to generate biological relevant output
when using miMsg. Supplementary Data H illustrates the effect
of random non—sense interactions. Inverse expression patterns
may occur by coincidence in expression data, which is not
permuted/randomized. miMsg might still identify top—scoring
significant interactions in these experiments. This effect dis—
appears when expression data is permutated/randomized.
Biological samples. miMsg generates optimal results when
using biological samples that are clearly related to the studied
hypothesis and include multiple comparable as well as clinically/
biologically diverse samples in roughly equally sized groups.
More samples indicate a lower probability of coincidental
RRs. Moreover, rankings become more sensible when the sam—
ples differ biologically/clinically (Fig. 2A). However, clustering
on biological/histological subtype may occur for many genes/

Expression data. Adequate measurement precision of the data
is of particular importance, as miMsg relies heavily on ranking.
Samples with identical expression levels for certain miRs/
mRNAs due to rounding off will be excluded in the analysis of
interactions involving these miRs/mRNAs (Supplementary Data
F). On the other hand, precision outside of the detection meth—
ods sensitivity/thresholds will not contribute to better results in
miMsg.

Scope of the study, limitations and future plans. In this article,
miMsg is applied to mRNA inhibition by miRs. Although there
is strong evidence that miRs inﬂuence mRNA levels, the com—
bined effect of mRNA inhibition and translational repression
without inﬂuencing mRNA levels (Huntzinger and Izaurralde,
2011) will not be detected by miMsg. Moreover, miMsg is
applied to cancer—related datasets. Cancer is a deregulated state
in which interactions might be detected easily. Theoretically

confidence interactions were selected. Literature review identiﬁed
four of these as most relevant for further study (Fig. 4). To
conclude, miMsg was highly effective in reducing a high
number of predicted miRimRNA interactions in GCT data,
generating a small high—conﬁdence set directly applicable to
further research.

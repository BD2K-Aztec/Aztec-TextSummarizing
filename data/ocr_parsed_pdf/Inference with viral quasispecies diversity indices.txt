Inference with viral quasispecies diversity indices

 

index of quasispecies complexity exists. In a large population in
equilibrium or with small perturbations, the genome frequencies
are related with their relative ﬁtness. There are a number of
useful indices and variables but none of them fully captures
that intuitive image. Viral quasispecies complexity may be
viewed as a multivariate feature, where the number of haplotypes
of polymorphic sites and their relative frequencies are its dimen—
sions. Each of these indices and variables are difﬁcult to estimate
given the expected diversity of a quasiespecies from available
data and the limited sample size amenable to analysis
(Domingo et al., 2012).

The primary indices measure the extend of the viral quasispe—
cies complexity by the number of haplotypes, polymorphic sites
and number of different mutations; these may be considered as
richness indices. Other indices such as the Shannon entropy (S)
(Shannon, 1948) or the Simpson index (Magurran, 2004) meas—
ure the diversity, or the evenness when normalized to maximum
diversity (Sn), while others such as the mutation frequency (Mf)
or the nucleotide diversity (Pi) measure the intrapopulation het—
erogeneity, that is how different are the members of the popula—
tion among them. S and Sn, or the Simpson index, are not
sensitive to the number of mutations. The Simpson index has
been less used with viral quasispecies (Nowak et a]. 1991,
Wolinsky et a]. 1996), as it provides a more stable, although
less sensitive, measure of diversity by downweighting the rare
haplotypes. Mf measures the heterogeneity with respect to the
most represented (dominant) sequence (Ramirez et al., 2013) or
the consensus sequence of the population (Cabot et al., 2000). Pi
gives the global population heterogeneity, taking into account
the average number of mutations between each pair of individ—
uals in the viral population (Nei, 1987). Each of these variables
describes a different part of the mutation space occupied by a
quasispecies, and they all provide relevant information regarding
mutation barriers to antiviral treatment resistance.

We studied by in—silico sampling the distribution and proper—
ties of three of the most common variables used to quantify the
viral quasispecies complexity in the literature, the diversity
through S and Sn and the heterogeneity through Mf. The qua—
sispecies richness by the number of estimated haplotypes in the
population is also studied because of its implications on Sn and
Mf. We propose methods for inference for each sampling
schemeiCCSS and Nkaith these complexity indices.

2 METHODS

2.1 Basic assumptions

To make simulations of CCSS or NGS sampling experiments, we need
the distribution of haplotypes of a viral quasispecies. We can empirically
approach a 1010 genomes distribution by taking the raw data from high
coverage amplicon ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) experiments of
samples of a wide complexity spectrum as reference distributions.
Simulations of measures by CCSS will be obtained by in-silico sam-
pling a given number of particles from the reference distribution, where
any particle has the same probability to be sampled. Simulations of meas-
ures from NGS data will be obtained by in-silico sampling a number of
particles from these distributions and setting an abundance ﬁlter, corres-
ponding to RT + PCR + NGS noise levels (Archer et al., 2012;
Beerenwinkel and Zagordi, 2011; Beerenwinkel et al., 2012; Flaherty
et al., 2012; Gilles et al., 2011; Huse et al., 2007; Loman et al., 2012;

Macalalad et al., 2012; Mild et al., 2011; Prosperi and Salemi, 2012;
Prosperi et al., 2011; Vandenbroucke et al., 2011; Zagordi et al., 2012).
This study is based on the following set of basic assumptions:

(a) A very high coverage (~50 000 times) UDPS amplicon dataset from
patient samples of HCV may be considered as a coarse approxima-
tion to the high complexity of RNA virus quasiespecies, and the
observed distribution of haplotypes may be used as a viral popula-
tion reference distribution from which to sample viral particles.

(b) A CCSS in-silico experiment consists in sampling a given number
of viral particles from a reference distribution. All obtained se-
quences are accepted as true members of the population.
Measures of viral quasispecies complexity are then computed
from the observed haplotypes and frequencies.

(c) The NGS methods have a noise level, due to Reverse transcription
(RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing errors,
below which we may not distinguish true from erroneous muta-
tions. Any data treatment of amplicon NGS sequences requires
some sort of abundance filter to exclude artifactual haplotypes and
point mutations.

((1) As a simple approach, a NGS in-silico experiment consists in
sampling a given number of molecules from the reference distribu-
tion, followed by an abundance ﬁlter to exclude all haplotypes
with abundance below the noise level. Measures of viral quasispe-
cies complexity are then computed from the ﬁltered haplotypes
and frequencies.

2.2 Indices of diversity, definitions and equations

We give in the Supplementary Material all relevant deﬁnitions and equa-
tions used throughout this work. That is, the deﬁnitions related to viral
quasispecies and to diversity indices, and the equations with and without
bias corrections.

2.3 Distribution of diversity measures

The distribution of a variable measuring viral quasispecies complexity
obtained by a CCSS experiment will be estimated by repeating a
number of times (2000) an in-silico sampling of a given number of viral
particles, and computing such variable each time. In this study, we re-
peated a number of times experiments with 20 and 50 clones, covering the
most common range of sample sizes in the literature. The distribution of
NGS measures were obtained by repeating the same number of times
(2000) in-silico samplings of 400 and 1000 reads sampled from the refer-
ence populations, ﬁltering at a noise level of 0.5% and computing the
complexity variables each time. This is a feasible expected mean coverage
in clinical settings with ~50 samples in a 454 Junior plate.

2.4 Shannon entropy normalization

In the ecology literature, the Shannon entropy (Supplementary Equation
SI) is normalized to the natural logarithm of the number of estimated
species in the population (Supplementary Equation SVI) so that a popu-
lation where all species are equally represented corresponds to a max-
imum entropy of 1, whereas a population with a single species is a
population of minimum entropy, with Sn 2 0. In the virology literature,
we observe other two normalizations. Either to log(N) (Abbate et al.,
2005; Cabot et al., 2000; Grande-Perez et al., 2002; Pawlotsky et al.,
1998) or to N (Fishman and Branch, 2009; Nasu et al., 2011; Nishijima
et al., 2012), where N is the sample size, that is the number of clones in
each sample. The normalization to log(N) is justiﬁed by saying that max-
imum entropy is attained when all observed molecules are different. These
two normalizations are sample size-dependent, that is, having the same S
for two samples of different size from the same population, we obtain two

different Sn. Normalizing to log(N) may be accepted when the number of
clones of all samples to be compared is the same as in (Abbate et al., 2005;
Pawlotsky et al., 1998) but lacks justiﬁcation otherwise.

A different measure of Shannon entropy may be obtained by the aver-
age of the per-site S, which would be normalized to log(4) for nucleotide
sequences, or to log(20) for amino acid sequencesithe natural logarithm
of the alphabet size.

In this study, we use the per-haplotype S, with Sn normalized to log(h),
where h is the number of estimated haplotypes in the population, accord-
ing to the deﬁnition of Shannon entropy used in ecology. The meaning of
the three normalizations is different. Where S/log(N) and S/N are scaled
versions of S with equivalent statistical properties, and S/log(h) requires
the estimate of h, and is inﬂuenced by its distribution.

2.5 Rarefaction

When the expected value of a diversity index depends of the sample size,
we render comparable two samples of different size by rarefaction. The
process of rarefaction (Magurran and McGill, 2010) is deﬁned as a re-
peated resampling without replacement from a sample to a smaller
sample size. In ecology, it is speciﬁcally used to compare species richness
values, and to construct rarefaction curves. This is particularly useful for
biased estimators where the bias is a function of the sample size, as the
number of haplotypes, S and Sn.

2.6 Fringe trimming

When ﬁltering the haplotypes of an NGS experiment above a given noise
level, say 0.5% for instance, because of the sampling process there are
chances to accept haplotypes with real abundances <0.5% while rejecting
haplotypes that are >0.5% in the population. This produces fringes of
haplotypes at the lower end of the NGS ﬁltered sample, which could
compromise the comparison of samples. A conservative way to make
comparable samples of ﬁltered data, eventually of different sizes, is to
trim these fringes up to a given conﬁdence level. Fringe trimming and
haplotype ﬁltering may be carried out in a single step by excluding all
haplotypes with

P(n 5 n,»|N,P = 0.005)<0.9

that is, by excluding the haplotypes with ni reads for which the probabil-
ity to observe up to ni counts in a sample of size N, when the haplotype
abundance in the population is 0.5%, is <90%. Both the noise level and
the conﬁdence level may be modiﬁed as required. As examples, 0.5 and
90% are just given, which ﬁt our requirements on HCV NS3 samples,
according to previous experience (Gregori et a]. 2013, Ramirez et a].
2013). In the Supplementary Material, we show results filtering at 0.2
and at 1%, and trimming at different conﬁdence levels.

2.7 Software and statistical methods

The in-silico sampling and all the computations and graphics were done
on the open source R language and environment (R Core Team, 2013)
using default libraries, and libraries in the Bioconductor project

(Gentleman et al., 2004) as the Biostrings library (Pages at al., 2012).
The R scripts are available upon request. NGS data simulations from a
set of haplotypes of the high complexity population were performed by
the Grinder program (Angly et a]. 2012) with the parameters described in
the Supplementary Material.

2.8 Data

Samples from two patients, one with an acute HCV infection and another
with a chronic HCV infection were used to obtain the reference distribu-
tions used in the in-silico sampling. Six amplicons covering the NS3 HCV
region were compared. The methods and protocols followed from patient
sampling to UDPS sequencing have been described elsewhere (Cubero
et al., 2013). A coarse quality ﬁlter is used on the raw 454 reads to exclude
all haplotypes represented by a single read, or those with more than two
indeterminations or three gaps. We took the haplotype distribution of
three of these amplicons as reference distributions of examples of quasis-
pecies with low, mid and high complexity. The corresponding fasta ﬁles
are included in the Supplementary Material, with frequencies (number of
reads and percentage) in the header of each haplotype. The characteriza-
tion of these reference quasispecies, along with the number of reads ob-
tained in sequencing are given in Table 1. Although the reference
distributions are based on HCV patient samples, we think that the con-
clusions are equally extensible to any virus passing through an RNA
phase.

2.9 In-silico sampling

The statistical properties of diversity indices are studied by in-silico sam-
pling from the reference distributions described above. The sampling is
done by generating n random integers, where n is the sample size, between
1 and N, where N is the number of molecules in the reference population,
with replacement, and assigning each random number to the correspond-
ing haplotype by the population cumulative distribution (Fig. 1A).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Data characterization

Three reference distributions of different levels of viral quasispe—
cies complexityilow, mid and highiare used as datasets
(Table 1). The proﬁle of these quasispecies populations may be
depicted by the cumulative distribution of its haplotype frequen—
cies (Fig. 1A). A complementary plot in Figure 1B gives the haplo—
type frequencies in descending order, with a dash—dot line at the
0. 5% cutoff showing the incidence of filtering on each population.
On the other hand, Supplementary Table S1 shows the effect of
filtering at different noise levels on the reference populations. The
most dramatic change is produced on the number of haplotypes,
followed by the number of polymorphic sites. Mf and Pi show a
smooth transition, while Sn displays a similar behavior except for
the mid—complexity population where larger changes are

reference populations used in the study. In abscissa the haplotypes are
ordered primarily by the Hamming distance to the most frequent haplo-
type, and ties are determined in descending order of frequency. The ﬁrst
haplotype is the dominant one, while the last is the one showing more
differences respect to the dominant and with a lower frequency in the
population. The ﬂatter the proﬁle, the less complex is the quasispecies.

ordered by decreasing frequency, the plot shows a detail of the full plot to
view the impact of ﬁltering on each of the three viral populations, with a
dash-dot line at the 0.5% threshold

observed. Increasing levels of filtering are considered as the grad—
ual elimination of genomes of low replication fitness. The number
of reads excluded by these filters is particularly high for the high—
complexity population, where filtering at 1% abundance repre—
sents the exclusion of 42.5% of the population. This is consistent
with the production of tails of low fitness mutants from each of the
haplotypes with enough replicating fitness.

3.2 Inference on complexity values in CCSS

We studied the distribution of S, Sn and Mf for CCSS samples of
20 and 50 clones, respectively, by 2000 replicates of in—silico
sampling, for each of the three populations. The median of the
observed values and the standard deviations are given in
Supplementary Table S2A. The corresponding boxplots are
shown in Figure 2A. Mf shows no bias with respect to the popu—
lation value in any of the three populations. For S and Sn, we
observe a bias with respect to the population value, which is
sample size—dependent. When comparing pairs of samples of

size 20 and 50, this differential bias could bring to the wrong
conclusion that they come from populations of different
diversity.

When applying the bias corrections of Hutcheson
(Supplementary Equation SII) (Hutcheson, 1970) and Chaol
(Supplementary Equation SIII) (Chao et al., 2009) the bias is
partially corrected but remains sample size dependent
(Supplementary Table S2B and Supplementary Fig. S1). While
applying the rarefaction of the samples of size 50 to size 20, the
median values of both samples are brought to the same level
(Supplementary Table S2C and Supplementary Fig. S2) and
the samples become comparable despite the different sample size.

In conclusion, the Mf values are not biased and may be dir—
ectly compared with no further precaution, but the comparison
of S or Sn values requires a bias correction. When the sizes of the
two samples being compared are unbalanced, the comparison of
S or Sn also requires the rarefaction of the big sample to the
small sample size (Box 1). Inference is carried out by the t—test
(Supplementary Equation SXI) (Hutcheson, 1970).

3.3 Inference on complexity values in NGS

We have taken 400 and 1000 reads as feasible sample sizes in a
clinical setting for the determination of the viral complexity by
NGS, with the same ratio as the 20 and 50 clones used in CCSS.
Now we consider as population diversity values those obtained
from the populations ﬁltered at the noise level (Supplementary
Table S2D). That is, the values that at best could be obtained by
NGS.

While filtering at the noise level most ‘rare’ haplotypes are
removed and the bias correction on S and Sn, as seen under
CCSS, has a lower impact. On the distribution of 2000 replicates
of samples of 400 and 1000 reads, ﬁltered at 0.5%, we still ob—
serve a sample size differential bias, not only for S and Sn, but
also for Mf in this sampling scheme (Supplementary Table S2D
and Fig. 2B). The bias correction of Hutcheson (Supplementary
Equation SII) has a limited impact, as expected.

We observed that the ﬁltering has effects that depend of the
sample size, as may be seen in Figure 3A with a scatterplot of the
number of haplotypes observed on 2000 replicates of pairs of
samples of size 400 and 1000. The small samples are clearly
biased toward higher number of haplotypes despite being
sampled from the same population, and ﬁltered at the same
abundance level. This effect is explained by the lower frequencies
at which the same haplotypes are observed when increasing the
sample size, particularly for those at the lower frequency end.
The number of haplotypes observed before filtering in the big
samples is higher than those observed in the small samples. As a
consequence, the relative frequencies of the same haplotypes are
lower in the big than in the small samples. This is illustrated in
Figure 3B, where we show a barplot with the probabilities to
observe an haplotype at a frequency of 0.5% in the population
with a number of reads up to a given number of counts, both for
samples of size 400 and 1000. The probability to observe such
haplotype in a sample of size 400 with up to 2 reads is higher
than the probability to observe the same haplotype in a sample
of size 1000 with up to 5 reads.

According to this observation, after filtering at noise level, the
small sample carries more information than the big sample. So

follow to next step.

mated number of haplotypes and the sample size.

(6) If the samples to be compared are unbalanced rarefy the
big sample to the size of the small one to obtain an esti—
mate of S or Sn and its variance. Use the observed value
and the computed variance for the small sample, and the

of each three clones observed will correspond to haplotypes
<0.5% in the population.

Under the assumption that all observed clones are true
members of the population, we observed by this sampling
scheme that S and Sn are biased, and that the bias is sample
size—dependent. We also observed that S shows a better behavior
to analytical bias correction than Sn, and that Mf is an unbiased
estimator. A less biased comparison of S or Sn values between
samples requires of intra—sample normalization, composed of
terms of correction (Supplementary Equations S11 and S111).
When the sample sizes are unbalanced, the normalization requires
a rarefaction of the big sample to the small sample size as well.

On the other hand, NGS methods are highly sensitive and re—
producible but they are limited by the technical noise level. By
discarding observed haplotypes, our diversity estimates are biased
with respect to the true population values. We may nevertheless
consider the haplotypes below the 0.5% frequency in our example
as spurious or of low biological relevancy at the sampling time
point. In this case, we used the diversity values of the filtered
population as gold standard, being the best we can achieve by
NGS. We observed a sample size—dependent bias on S, Sn and Mf.

The minimum differential bias is provided by rarefaction for S
and Sn. For Mf, fringe trimming provides an unbiased compari—
son. When the samples to be compared are not very unbalanced
and the abundance filter is above noise level, fringe trimming
could give good results for S, Sn and Mf.

The in—silico sampling and simulation allowed us to assess the
validity of the estimate and tests used in ecology when dealing
with viral quasispecies with S, Sn and Mf, and permitted to
identify the key points for less biased comparisons of complexity
indices under the same sampling scheme.

In this work, we have empirically studied the statistical proper—
ties of S, Sn and Mf while observing the quasispecies viral com—
plexity either by CCSS or by NGS, and through this we assessed

the means for less biased comparisons of complexity indices.
These methods could allow us to statistically conclude whether
a viral quasispecies is expanding or contracting in diversity, in—
dependently of the size of the samples being compared.

In the Supplementary Material we give the formulation, and in
Boxes 1 and 2 we propose the methods of data treatment for
inference for each of the two methodologies, CCSS and NGS.

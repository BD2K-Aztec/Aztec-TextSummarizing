ABSTRACT

Motivation: The genetic basis of complex traits often involves
the function of multiple genetic factors, their interactions and the
interaction between the genetic and environmental factors. Gene—
environment (G><E) interaction is considered pivotal in determining
trait variations and susceptibility of many genetic disorders such as
neurodegenerative diseases or mental disorders. Regression-based
methods assuming a linear relationship between a disease response
and the genetic and environmental factors as well as their interaction
is the commonly used approach in detecting G><E interaction. The
linearity assumption, however, could be easily violated due to non-
linear genetic penetrance which induces non-linear G ><E interaction.
Results: In this work, we propose to relaxthe linear G><E assumption
and allow for non-linear G><E interaction under a varying coefficient
model framework. We propose to estimate the varying coefficients
with regression spline technique. The model allows one to assess
the non-linear penetrance of a genetic variant under different
environmental stimuli, therefore help us to gain novel insights into
the etiology of a complex disease. Several statistical tests are
proposed for a complete dissection of G><E interaction. A wild
bootstrap method is adopted to assess the statistical significance.
Both simulation and real data analysis demonstrate the power and
utility of the proposed method. Our method provides a powerful and
testable framework for assessing non-linear G><E interaction.

1 INTRODUCTION

The genetic basis of a complex trait often involves multiple genetic
factors functioning in a coordinated manner. The extent on how our
genetic blueprint expresses also depends on the interactions between
genetic and environmental factors. Increasing evidences have shown
that gene—environment (G XE) interactions play pivotal roles in
determining the risk of diseases, for instance, the psychiatric diseases
(reviewed in Caspi and Mofﬁtt, 2006), the neurodegenerative and

cardiovascular diseases (Costa and Eaton, 2006), and cancer (Ulrich
et al., 1999). Due to the complex nature of the form and mechanism
of G><E interaction in different living organisms, hunting down the
molecular machinery of G ><E interaction has been a daunting task in
the post-genomic era. There is a pressing need in developing efﬁcient
and powerful statistical methods for a rigorous investigation of G ><E
interaction.

G><E interaction refers to how genotypes inﬂuence phenotypes
differently in different environments (Falconer, 1952). From a
biological point of view, G><E interaction can be better viewed as
the genetic responses to environment Changes or stresses (Hoffmann
and Parsons, 1991; MCClintock, 1984). In a typical G><E interaction
study design, environment is often deﬁned as different conditions
coded as a discrete variable in a statistical model. For example, in
a study of G><E interaction related to lung cancer, smoking status
can be deﬁned as an environment condition coded as 1 (smoking) or
0 (no smoking). In many other studies, the environment condition
is deﬁned as a continuous measure. For one example, studies show
that ~80% of type II diabetes and 70% of cardiovascular disease
are related to obesity [deﬁned by body mass index (BMI)]. To
track down genetic factors responsible for diabetes or cardiovascular
disease, obesity can be deﬁned as an environment factor that may
induce or reduce the expression of particular genes to affect the
disease status. The contribution of the same gene to a disease status
may be largely different under different BMI levels. As another
example, the peak bone mineral density (BMD) in adulthood varies
a lot across different age groups. The amount of nutrition intake (e. g.
vitamin D) is also an important environment factor inﬂuencing the
variation of BMD (Peacock et al., 2002). Individuals carrying the
same gene may respond differently to the rate of density decrease
as they get older. Also the peak BMD measure may vary a lot
across groups with different nutrition intake, potentially due to the
interaction of speciﬁc genes with the amount of nutrition intake (e. g.
vitamin D).

Statistical methods for testing G><E interaction can be broadly
categorized into two areas: the model-based method, either
parametrically, non-parametrically or semi-parametrically (e.g.
Chatterjee and Carroll 2005; Guo 2000; Kraft et al.,. 2007; Maity
et al.,. 2009), and the model-free method such as the multifactor
dimensionality reduction method (Hahn et al., 2003). In a model-
based regression framework, traditional parametric methods need
strong model assumptions such as assuming linear G><E interaction

as given in model (1). This assumption, however, could be easily
violated due to the underlying nonlinear machinery between the
genetic and environment factors. Mis-speciﬁcation in parametric
models could lead to large bias. Non-parametric modeling as an
alternative way reduces modeling bias by imposing no speciﬁc
model structure and enables people to explore the data more
ﬂexibly at the cost of interpretability. The information about the
relationship between the dependent and independent variables from
the estimates is often difﬁcult to interpret. Moreover, the variances
of the resulting estimates tend to be unacceptably large when the
dimension of the covariates is high, which is the so-called ‘Curse
of dimensionality’. To overcome these difﬁculties, many different
semi-parametric models have been proposed and developed, among
which varying coefﬁcient (VC) models have gained considerable
attention in recent years and are becoming very popular in data
analysis, see for example, the work of Cleveland et al. (1991), Hastie
and Tibshirani (1993), Hoover et al. (1998), Fan and Zhang (1999),
Cai et al. (2000), Fan and Zhang (2000), Huang et al. (2004) among
others. VC models as natural extensions of linear models allow the
coefﬁcients to Change smoothly with the value of other variables so
that one can explore dynamic feature of datasets successfully with
good interpretability and ﬂexibility. See Fan and Zhang (2008) for a
detailed review. In this article, we apply varying coefﬁcient models
to investigate G X E interactions.

In G><E interaction problems, one is interested in understanding
how genes respond differently across different environment
conditions in determining the variation of a trait or the risk of a
disease. We focus our attention to environment conditions measured
on a continuous scale. From a statistical point of view, ‘interaction’
is typically modeled as a product term. A simple model to detect
interaction would be a simple linear regression model with the form

Y=a0+a1X+f31G+f32XG+a (l)

where Y is the phenotypic response; 010 is the overall mean; 011 and
51 are the effects of the environment (X) and genetic (G) variables,
respectively; 52 is the effect for G><E interaction; and 8 is the error
term with mean 0 and variance 02. A simple rearrangement of model
(1 ) leads to

Y=0l0+011X+(f31+f32X)G+8- (2)

With this representation, it is Clear that the contribution of a gene to
the variation of a phenotype Y is restricted to a linear function in X.
The form and pattern of the responses are typically unknown and
may not follow a linear relationship as described in model (1).

In addressing the limitation of the linear model assumption in
dissecting the role of a gene under different environment conditions,
one can relax the linearity assumption of G ><E interaction and allow
for a non-linear interaction by replacing the linear G ><E interaction
coefﬁcient 51 +52X in model (2) by a smooth non-linear function
5(X) and apply a VC model to detect non-linear G><E interaction.
A VC model has the form

Y=a(X)+ﬂ(X)G+U(X)8, (3)

for given covariates (X, G)T and the response Y with E (8 IX, G )= 0
and Var (8|X, G )= 1. f3 (X) is a smoothing ﬁinction in X and
02 (X )=Var(Y IX, G) is the conditional variance function. Under
the VC modeling framework, the effect of a gene is allowed to vary
as a ﬁinction of environmental factors, either linearly or non-linearly,

captured by the model itself. Thus, the VC model has the potential
to dissect the non-linear penetrance of genetic variants.

Methods for the estimation of VC models have ﬂourished in
the literature, which can be grouped into three categories. One is
local polynomial kernel smoothing, see Fan and Zhang (1999), Xia
and Li (1999) and Cai et al. (2000). One is spline-based method,
see Huang et al. (2004) for polynomial spline, and Hoover et al.
(1998) and Chiang et al. (2001) for smoothing spline. The last one is
wavelet estimation, see Zhou and You (2004). In this work, we adopt
the polynomial spline approach in Huang et al. (2004) to estimate
the coefﬁcient functions ﬂ(-) for several major reasons. First, the
coefﬁcient functions are approximated by a linear combination of
B-spline basis functions, which provides a simple global solution
to estimation and inference for VC models, and great ﬂexibility
is achieved by using different basis expansions for approximating
different coefﬁcient functions, which are stated in Huang et al.
(2004). Secondly, because of its global nature in computation,
B-splines are computationally expedient compared with kernel-
based methods, which is much necessary for analyzing high-
dimensional genetic data with hundreds of thousands of markers.
Moreover, it is theoretically reliable guarded by the asymptotic
consistency and normality property of the spline estimator B(-),
see Huang et al. (2004).

Besides estimation, to test whether the coefﬁcient function of
f3 (X) in model (3) is signiﬁcantly different from zero or a constant
or has a presumed parametric form is also of our interest. Because
of the distribution-free nature of semi-parametric models, the
likelihood ratio test for traditional parametric models cannot be
applied. We adopt the wild bootstrapping approach as in Hardle
and Mammen (1993) to assess the signiﬁcance of the tests. The
integrated squared difference between the parametric and the non-
parametric functional estimates is used as a test statistic, and the
critical value is determined by the bootstrap method described in
Hardle and Mammen (1993).

The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce
the methodology of applying VC models to genetic data to detect
G><E interaction. We introduce the B-spline ﬁtting technique and
its necessary notations. We introduce the test statistics for the
hypothesis testing evaluated by the wild bootstrap strategy. In
Section 3, we study the ﬁnite sample properties of the proposed
procedure using the simulated example. Furthermore, the utility of
the method is illustrated through the analysis of areal dataset detailed
in Section 4, followed by the discussion in Section 5.

2 STATISTICAL METHODS
2.1 A two-parameter VC model

In model (3), we only consider the additive effect of a genetic variant.
In real life, we do not know the true gene action mode, hence a
more ﬂexible model is to consider both additive and dominance
penetrance effects. We assume a continuous response variable Y
which is a ﬁinction of an environment variable X and the additive
and dominance scales G1 and G2 of a genetic factor. Each genetic
factor has three possible genotype categories represented by AA,
Aa and aa. The three genotype categories can be coded as 1, 0
and —1 for the additive scale G1, and as —1/2, 1/2 and —1/2
for the dominance scale G2, corresponding to genotypes AA, Aa
and aa, respectively. We assume allele A is the minor allele with

Varying coefficient model for G><E interaction

 

its frequency represented by pA. We model the coefﬁcients of
G1 6 (1,0, —1 ) and G2 6 (—1/2, 1/2, —1/2) for each genetic factor
as smooth functions of the environment variable X. Since our
major interests are the estimation and inference about the coefﬁcient
functions for G1 and G2, for simplicity we impose a linear structure
on the intercept function a (X ) deﬁned in model (3) by letting
a (X )= a0+a1X, although a non-parametric smooth ﬁinction can
also be ﬁtted. Thus, the redeﬁned VC model is given as

Y=010+0£1X+f31 (X)G1+52(X)02+U(X)8, (4)

for given covariates (X,G1,G2 ), with E (SIX, G1,G2 )=0,
Var (8|X, G1 , G2 )= 1 and the conditional mean ﬁinction of Y given
X, G1 and G2 is E(Y|X,G1,G2)=m(X,G1,G2)=a0+a1(X)+
51 (X )G1 + 52 (X )G2. The same model is ﬁtted separately for each
marker, followed by multiple testing corrections. The two-parameter
model given in (4) is not only biologically more meaningful than
the one-parameter model given in (3), but also statistically attractive
since it is invariant to allele coding (i.e. whether code AA as 1 or
code aa as 1 for variable G1).

Remark: varying coefﬁcient models can be considered as locally
linear models. By assuming speciﬁc expressions for 51 (-) and
52 (- ), model (4) would become a parametric model. For example,
by letting 51(X)=51+53Xsand £32 (X)=f32+f34X7 Where 517 52,
53 and 54 are constants, model (4) can be written as

Y=010+011X+f31G1 +52G2+53XG1 +54XG2+0(X)87 (5)

which is a linear regression model with main effects for X and
(G1,G2) as well as their interaction effects (denoted hereafter as
LM-I). If we assume a homogeneous residual variance, this is
the commonly applied linear regression model for testing G><E
interaction which reduces to model (1) if only additive effect is
considered. If we impose a constant structure on 51(X) and 52(X),
i.e. 51(X)=ﬂl and 52(X)=52, then model (4) is reduced to

Y=a0+alx+ﬂlG1+52G2+U(X)87 (6)

which is a linear regression model without the interaction terms
(denoted hereafter as LM). Therefore, the traditional linear
regression model for testing G><E interaction is a special case of
model (4).

Although, their properties are very well established, the
conventional parametric approaches are infeasible in this case, since
the functional forms of 51 (-) and 52 (-) are unknown to us due to
the complexity of the underlying interaction mechanism. Any mis-
speciﬁcation of the model would lead to uncertainty estimates and
low power (see Fig. 1 in Section 3 Monte Carlo simulation). By
relaxing the linear assumption for the coefﬁcients 51(X) and 52(X),
model (4) has much ﬂexibility to capture the non-linear penetrance
of a genetic variant under different environmental stimuli, thus
ensures the power of the proposed VC model in detecting non-
linear G><E interactions. In this article, we apply the B-spline
smoothing technique to estimate 51 (-) and 520, which solves
only one least squares problem to get the estimators. The great
advantages of B-spline estimation are simple implementation and
fast computation.

As in most works on non-parametric smoothing, estimation of the
functional coefﬁcients 51 (-) and £320 is conducted on a compact
interval [a,b]. In this article, we denote the space of p-th order

smooth function on [a,b] as C(17) [a,b]= [g‘g(p) EC[a,b] ], and
C [a,b] is the space of continuous functions on [a,b].

We make the following assumptions on the functional coefﬁcient
model, where Assumptions (A1)—(A3) are identical with (A1), (A4)
and (A5) in Hardle and Mammen (1993), while Assumption (A4) is
the same as (A1) in Wang and Yang (2009):

(A1) The marginal density f (-) of X is bounded away from zero
andf(-)EC[a,b].

(A2) 02 (-)=Var(Y|X=x, G ) is bounded away from 0 and 00.
(A3) E [exp (ts )] is bounded for |t| small enough.

(A4) For k = 1,2, 5k (x)e C(q)[a,b], for a given integer q 3 1, and
the spline order 1) satisﬁes 1) 3 q.

2.2 Parameter estimation

Given a random sample {(X,-,G,-,Y,-)};'=1 from model (4), the
polynomial spline modeling is adopted to estimate 13 (-). Let .7"
be the space of polynomial splines of order [)3 1. We introduce a
knot sequence with N" interior knots

k_(p_1) = ...=k_1=k0=a<k1<
.. < kN <b=kN+1=...=kN+p,

where N EN" increases when sample size 11 increases, and the
precise order is given in Assumption (A5). Then .77" consists of
functions a" satisfying (i) w" is a polynomial of degree 11— 1 on each
of the subintervals IS =[k5,ks+1), s=0, ...,N,, — 1, IN" = [an ,b];
and (ii) for p32, a" is 11—2 time continuously differentiable on
[a, b]. Let 1,, =Nn +1), where N" is the number of interior knots. We
deﬁne the normalized B-spline basis as {35: 1 fsfln}T as given
in Wang and Yang (2009). Equally spaced knots are used in this
article for simplicity. The distance between neighboring interior or
boundary knots is h = h" = (b — a) (Nn + 1 )_1 . For positive numbers
an and b" and for n: 1, let an ~bn mean that limnaooan/bn =c,
where c is some non-zero constant. The number of interior knots
satisfy Assumption (A5) below.

(A5) The number of interior knots N=Nn ~n1/(2p+1), i.e.
an1/ (2171-1 ) 3N f Can/(Zp'l‘l) for some positive constants
cN and CN.

For each marker, and k=1,2, the coefﬁcients 5k (x) is
estimated by Bk (X)EZ:"=13:SJ(BS (x) where the coefﬁcients

{(@,El,xggl,xggg)1fsfjn}T are solutions of the following least
squares problem

2.3 Number of knots N and spline order p selection

For the proposed model, it is necessary to select appropriate knots
and spline order to avoid over- and undersmoothing. For simplicity,
we assume the same spline basis {BS : 1 f s 3 J n }T to approximate the
coefﬁcient functions 51 (x) and 52 (x), even though the spline order
and knots can be different for the two functions. We use the Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) criteria to select the ‘optimal’ N, denoted

by Nopt, from [max<[0.5n1/(2p+1):|, 1), [1.5n1/(2p+1)]], where
[b] denotes an integer part of b, and the ‘optimal’ order p for the
spline basis, denoted by 1301”, from (3,4), which minimize the
BIC value BIC (N,p)=log (32)+ (N+p)log (n)/n, where 32 =
Z?=1{Yi—ﬁ1:(Xi,G1i,G2i)}2/n. 11:3 and 4 are the orders for
quadratic and cubic splines, respectively. A grid search for the
combination of hypothesized values for N and p can be done and
the values of N and 1) corresponding to the minimum of the BIC
values are the ‘optimal’ results.

2.4 Hypothesis testing

Before we test possible G><E interaction, the ﬁrst step is to assess
whether a genetic marker is associated with a phenotype. This can
be done by formulating the hypotheses

H0151(~)=ﬂz(~)=0
(8)

H1 :at least one functional coefﬁcient is not zero

If the null is rejected, then we test signiﬁcance of the additive effect
(G1 ) and the dominance effect (G2 ), by formulating the hypotheses

H3251 (->=0 H3:tb(->=0

,and (9)
Hizﬂimeéo afﬁx->750

When either the null in (9) is rejected, we then test if the coefﬁcient

functions 51 (X) and 52 (X) in model (4) are varying or not. The
hypotheses for this test are formulated by

H3025]. «)=m, fork=1,2
(10)
HYCznotnull

where 5k, k: 1,2, are unknown constants, for the selected genetic
markers from the ﬁrst step. Under H30, the reduced model can
be written as Y :ao +a1X+ﬂlG1+ﬂgG2 +0 (X )8, which implies
that there is no G ><E interaction. Thus, Hypothesis (10) is essentially
a test for G><E interaction. Upon rejecting the null, one can also
proceed to test H16: 51 (X) = 51 +ﬂ3X and 52(X) = 52 +ﬂ4X. Under
H8, the reduced models can be written as Y=a0+a1X+ﬂlG1 +
£3sz + 53 G1X + ﬁ4G2X +0 (X )8, a model commonly applied for
assessing linear G><E interaction assuming both additive and
dominance effects. Rejecting the null implies non-linear G><E
interaction.

2.5 Wild bootstrap to assess statistical signiﬁcance

Note that the current model does not assume any speciﬁc
distribution for the error term 8, thus there is no likelihood
function for the data. Borrowing the idea from Hardle and
Mammen (1993), we use the integrated squared deviation between
the estimators denoted by El: (-) and ER (-) of m(X,G1,G2)
for the ﬁill and reduced models as the test statistic, which
would be 7%: y=1lﬁF(XitG1itG2i)—ﬁR (XitG1i7G2i)}2/ns
where {(Xi,G1,-,G2i,Y,-),i=1,...,n} is a random sample of
(X ,G1,G2,Y ). For the superiority of 7;, over other goodness-of-
ﬁt tests, see the discussion in Hardle and Mammen (1993). The
authors pointed out that a way of computing critical values could
possibly be based on resampling from the entire dataset. However, it
was shown that this bootstrapping method (the classical bootstrap)
failed, since the bootstrapped statistic does not have the same limit

behavior. Thus, a new variant of the bootstrap method called wild
bootstrap was proposed, which is adopted in this work.

For the i-th observation, recall that ER (Xi,G1,-,G2i) and
ﬁF(Xi,G1i,G2i) are the estimators of m(Xi,G1i,G2,-) for
the reduced and full model, respectively. As discussed
in Hardle and Mammen (1993), in order to mimic the
i.i.d. structure of (Xi,G1,-,G2i,Yl-), we need to construct
the bootstrap procedure so that E* (Yi*IX*,GTi,G:i)=
ﬁR(X*,G’fi,G’2‘i), where {(Xlr,G’fi,G;i,Yi*)}f=1 is the
bootstrap sample drawn from the set {(Xi,G1i,G2,-,Yi)};'=1.
For this purpose, we deﬁne Ei=Yi—ﬁ1: (Xi,G1,-,G2i) and
construct 8f=UiEi, where Ul- is a two-point distributed
random variable independent of (Xi,G1,-,G2i,Yl-) satisfying
U,=1/2—¢§/2 with probability (1+ﬁ)/(2¢3),
U,=1/2+f5/2 with probability 1—(1+f5)/(2f5). By
simple calculation, we obtain that E(8?<|Xi,G1i,G2i)=0,
E(8?‘2|X,~,G1i,02i)=3i2 and E(e;‘3|X,-,Gl,-.G2,-)=E,3. Then
we use (Xi,G1,-,G2i,Yi*=ﬁR(Xi,G1i,Gzi)+8?‘) as bootstrap
observations and create ’T*’W like 7;, by the squared
deviation between the coefﬁcient estimators under H0 and
H1. From the Monte Carlo approximation of [2* (7;*’W)=
£(7'*’WI(Xi,G1i,G2,-);'=1 ), then the P-value pv is obtained
by ﬁnding the (1— pv )-th quantile 73V which satisﬁes ill/=7}.
Multiple testing should be then adjusted among the tests for all
markers using a method such as the false discovery rate (FDR)
procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

3 MONTE CARLO SIMULATION

A continuous environment measure (e.g. age, diet and body mass),
denoted as X, was generated from a normal distribution. Then
we transformed X by Z=<I>{(X—/tX )/oX} in order to make
X distributed more evenly on each subinterval 15, where ﬁx
and 0X are the mean and SD of X, estimated by the sample
mean and SD, and CD (-) is the cumulative distribution function
for the standard normal. We then used the transformed Z to
generate the B-spline basis. For k=1,2, 5k (x) was estimated by
B]. (mazgﬁtmm (x—MX >/ax}]=2{;,ik,.3: (x) where
the coefﬁcients {(30,31,2115215)15551n}T are solutions of the
least squares problem given in Equation (7).

Given a minor allele frequency (MAF) of pA and assuming
Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium, SNP genotypes (AA, Aa and aa)
were simulated from a multinomial distribution with frequency (11%,
2pA(1—pA), (1 —pA)2) for (AA, Aa, aa). The genetic variables G1,-
and G2,- were coded as (1,0,—1) and (—%, %,—%) for genotypes
(AA, Aa, aa), respectively, following an orthogonal quantitative
genetic model (Cockerham, 1954). The random error term 8,- was
simulated from N (0,1). Different sample sizes (i.e., n=200, 500,
1000), and different heritability levels (i.e., H2=0.01,0.03,0.05)
were assumed. For a given genetic effect and a heritability level,
o(X,-) varies for different Xi, and detailed calculation can be found
in the following sections. Data were simulated assuming different
gene action modes and were subsequently analyzed by three models,
i.e., the proposed VC model, the linear regression model without
interaction (denoted as LM), and the linear regression model with
interaction (denoted as LM-I). The likelihood ratio test was applied
to evaluate the power for testing H0 :51 = 52 = 0 for the LM model

and 7-[0 :51 = 52 = 53 = 54 = 0 for the LM-I model. The likelihood
ratio statistics follows a chi-square distribution with 2 and 4 degrees
of freedom for the two models. Wild bootstrap was applied to assess
the test signiﬁcance of the VC model.

We generated the phenotype data assuming the following VC
model

Yi=¢¥0+011Xi+f31(Xi)Gii+f32(Xi)G2i+0(Xi)8i

where 010 = 3.0, 00:01 and 51 (x) and 52 (x) were generated
from the B-spline basis functions such that 51 (x) = 23:121535 (x)
and 52 (x)=zf=1A2,B, (x), in which An = —0.53, 212:0.31
A13 = —0.44, A14 =0.50, A21: —0.87, A22 =0.7l, A23 = — l .27
and 224 = 1.15. These spline coefﬁcients were calculated from
Equation (7) based on SNP 22 265 753 from a real dataset
(Table 1). The reason we generated 5(X) this way is to
mimic real data, even though we could generate 5(X) from a
parametric function such as a sin or a polynomial function. The
variance function 02 (x) was obtained by solving H2 = Vg/(VG+
VE), where H2 is the heritability level; VG (x) =5? (x)var (G1)
+13% (x )var (G2 ) +251 (x )5; (x)cov (G1, G2 ) is the genetic variance
in which var(Gi>=2pA(1—p.r>, Var(Gz)=1/4{1—(2PA—1)4},
and cov (G1,G2)=2pA (1 711A ) (211A — l ); and VE =02(x). Simple
algebra shows that H2 = [1 +02 (x)/VG (x)]_1, which gives
02 (x) = (l /H2 — l )VG (x). Assuming different heritability levels,
i.e. H2 =0.01, 0.03, 0.05, the phenotype Yl- can be generated
assuming 8,- ~N(0, 1). As can be seen that the genetic variance is
a function of the MAF, so does for the residual variance 0(X).

For a ﬁxed MAF, the residual variance decreases as the heritability
increases. Thus, we expect high power under high H 2 value.
However, due to the way we deﬁned the calculation of V0, it is
no longer true that o(X) decreases as the MAF increases for a
ﬁxed H2 level. So the power no longer monotonically increases
with the increase of the MAF as usually assumed in human genetic
association studies. Based on the estimated frequency (pA =0.08)
of the SNP from the real data, we ﬁxed the allele frequency
and evaluated the power performance of the three methods under
different heritability levels. Empirical power was recorded based on
1000 simulation repetitions, each with 10 000 bootstrapped samples.

Figure 1 shows that the testing power increases as the sample
size n and heritability level H 2 increase for the three models. For
a ﬁxed genetic effect, large heritability level leads to small residual
variance, and consequently leads to increased power. It is clear
that the VC model outperforms the other two models in all cases.
Since the linear model with interaction (LM-I) is closer to the VC
model in structure, it achieves higher power than the linear model
without interaction (LM). The simulation results indicate that when
the nature of the G><E interaction is non-linear, i.e. when a variant
shows a strong non-linear penetrance effect, a mis-speciﬁcation of
an analytical model assuming a linear structure suffers tremendously
from power loss.

We also evaluated the performance of the VC model when the
underlying true interaction follows a linear structure or no interaction
at all. False positive control of the methods were also studied
(see Supplementary Material). Here, we provide a summary of

the simulation: (i) when the underlying true interaction model is
non-linear, the proposed VC model has the highest power among the
three. The other two parametric linear models suffer tremendously
from power loss (Fig. 1); (ii) when the underlying true model is linear
with or without interaction, the linear model assuming interaction
or no interaction has the best power. However, as the sample size
and heritability level increase, the power difference between the
VC model and the other two decreases signiﬁcantly; and (iii) in
real data analysis, the VC model cannot substitute the other two
models before we know the true functional effect. We can ﬁrst
do a hypothesis testing to check if the coefﬁcient functions 5k (X),
k: 1,2, are constant or linear in X, then apply the optimal model in
the analysis. The non-linear VC model would be the choice if the
constant or linear function is rejected. Otherwise, a linear model is
suggested, especially when sample size is small.

4 REAL DATA ANALYSIS

We applied the method to a real dataset which contains 1536
new born babies, recruited through the Department of Obstetrics
and Gynecology at Sotero del Rio Hospital in Puente Alto, Chile.
Total 648 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering 189
unique genes were analyzed after eliminating SNPs with MAF
<0.05 and those departure from Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium. When
ﬁtting to the VC model, we found that the spline design matrix
could be singular when there are extremely unbalanced genotype
distributions, especially when only two genotypes categories were
present for an SNP. Thus, we eliminated additional 143 SNPs
and only 505 SNPs were included in our analysis. (Note that the
143 SNPs can also be analyzed by ﬁtting a one-parameter VC
model assuming only additive effect. To demonstrate the model
application, we omitted the results of the 143 SNPs.) Phenotypes
were initially dichotomized as small for gestational age (SGA) or
large for gestational age (LGA) depending on the babies’ birth
weight and the mother’s gestational age. The initial study were
designed to identify genetic risk factors associated with SGA or
LGA. We took the original birth weight (kg) measure as the response
and merged the two datasets together to form one dataset for an
analysis.

It is postulated that baby’s birth weight might be related to
mother’s body mass index (MBMI). When a baby resides inside
of its mother’s womb, the environmental conditions are deﬁned
through its mother, for instance, mother’s age and obesity condition
(measured by MBMI). Under different environmental stimuli (e.g.

MBMI), fetus carrying the same genes might trigger different
responses, consequently leading to different birth weights. This is
due to the complex interaction between a mother’s obesity condition
and fetus’ genes. With the combined data, we were interested in
identifying genetic factors that can explain the normal variation of
birth weight, and if any, inﬂuenced by MBMI. The results were
tabulated in Table 1. Additional information for real data analysis
can be found in Supplementary Material.

The ﬁrst three columns list the SNP ID, the gene and location
each SNP belongs to. When we applied the FDR control method
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995), only two SNP showed statistical
signiﬁcance (indicated by * in Table 1). To illustrate the method, we
also listed SNPs with P-values that are <0.005. The P-values for the
overall genetic effect tests, i.e. H0: 51 (-)=ﬂg (-)=0, are given in
the column denoted by P_VC, P_LM and P_LMi when ﬁtting the
data with the VC, LM and LM-I models, respectively. The upper
panel shows the results with the VC model ﬁt. Testing constant
coefﬁcients (H30) indicates that the function of these SNPs does

vary across MBMI (P_const<0.05). Further tests (H8) show that
the function of these SNPs do not follow a linear structure either.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the P-values obtained with the
VC model are all smaller than the ones obtained by ﬁtting the LM
and LM-I models.

SNPs with P < 0.005 when ﬁtting the LM model are listed in the
middle panel of the table. Testing results show that the coefﬁcients of
these three SNPs do not vary across MBMI (P_const> 0.05). Thus,
we observed the smallest P-values for the three SNPs when they
were ﬁtted with the LM model. The bottom panel lists six SNPs
when the best ﬁtting model is the LM-I model (P_LMi<0.005).
As a result, the smallest P-values were observed for the six SNPs
when ﬁtted with the LM-I model. Testing linear interaction indicates
that the six SNPs do have strong interaction effects (P_i<0.05).
In summary, the real data analysis results are consistent with the
simulation results in which optimal P-value is always obtained by
ﬁtting the data with the ‘true’ model. If we only ﬁt the data with a
linear model with or without interaction, we could potentially miss
the ones detected by the VC model.

Varying coefficient model for G><E interaction

 

We picked SNP rs9622979 located in gene PDGFB as an
example to further demonstrate the performance of the VC model.
Figure 2A plots the ﬁtted baby’s birth weight (in kg) against
MBMI for individuals carrying different genotypes. The three curves
correspond to the ﬁtted BW for three different genotypes. The
sample mean is indicated by the dashed straight line. The minor allele
for this SNP is T and the estimated MAF is 0.1. From the ﬁtted plot,
we can see the non-linear interaction effect between this SNP and
MBMI on infant’s birth weight. When MBMI is low, infants carrying
genotype CC have low birth weight, but not for those carrying the
other two types of genotype. As MBMI increases, mother’s body size
has a positive effect on infant’s birth weight, so we saw a slightly
increasing trend for infant birth weight. However, infants carrying
different genotypes show a clearly different response pattern on
birth weight corresponding to the increase of MBMI. For example,
infants carrying genotype TT show a sharp increase in their body
weight compared with other two genotypes as MBMI passing 25. So
mother’s obesity condition triggers a stronger effect on TT genotypes
than the other two genotypes.

Figure 2B plots the heritability estimation under different
mother’s BMI conditions. The plot also shows the non-linear
penetrance of the variant under different MBMI conditions. Strong
penetrance effects (corresponding to large H 2 values) are observed
when MBMI is between 25 and 30. The genetic effect (penetrance)
tends to stabilize when MBMI reaches 35. This result ﬁts to
our intuition as we do not expect a fetus grow unlimited when
mother’s body size increases. If the phenotype of interest is a disease
status measurement, prevention efforts should be geared toward
those environment conditions corresponding to large heritability
estimate.

The spline estimators Bk (-) of the coefﬁcient functions 5k (- ),
k: 1,2 are plotted in Figure 2C and D. It is clearly seen that Bk (x ),
k: 1,2, does vary across MBMI. The additive effect 51(X) shows
a quadratic pattern and levels off as MBMI passes 33. This implies
that the additive effect of this SNP variant approaches a limit for
obese mothers (MBMI> 33), so does for the dominance effect but
with a more varying pattern of effect under low MBMI. Due to the
non-linear penetrance effect of this SNP under different environment
stimuli (measured by mother’s obese condition), this SNP could be
missed if we ﬁtted the data with the traditional linear interaction
model. This example demonstrates the advantage of the VC model
in the identiﬁcation of important genetic variants with non-linear
penetrance under different environment stimuli.

5 DISCUSSION

The natural variation of a quantitative phenotype is not only
determined by the inherited genetic factors, but also can be explained
by how sensitive a genetic factor responds to environmental stimuli.
Gene—environment interaction, the genetic control of sensitivity to
environment, plays a pivotal role in determining trait variations. In
humans, most diseases results from a complex interaction between
an individual’s genetic blueprint and the associated environmental
condition. For example, type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease
are often due to the complex interaction between an individual’s
genes and obesity condition. The more we learn about how genes
interact with environment in determining trait variations and disease
risks, the more we can achieve in prevention and treatment of
illnesses.

The importance of G><E interaction in human disease has been
historically recognized (e.g. Costa and Eaton, 2006). Many statistical
methods have been proposed to target G><E interaction. In this
work, we relaxed the linear G><E interaction assumption, and
proposed a new method considering non-linear G X E interaction. We
focused our attention on environment with continuous measurement
(e.g. dietary intake, obesity condition and the amount of addictive
substances). We adopted the well-known VC model into a genetic
mapping framework and proposed to estimate the functional
coefﬁcient by the non-parametric B-spline technique. The superior
performance of the VC model in detecting non-linear G><E
interaction has been demonstrated with extensive Monte Carlo
simulations. When the genetic contribution to the variation of
a phenotype varies largely across environmental conditions, the
proposed VC model achieves the optimal power compared with
models assuming constant or linear coefﬁcient.

Although in theory, the B-spline estimator converges to the true
underlying function, depending on various factors, the VC model
may not achieve the optimal power when the true function is constant
or linear. In real data analysis, often the heritability level is unknown
before we ﬁt a model. Thus, it is necessary to conduct a hypothesis
test to assess the true underlying functional coefﬁcient. Based on
the results from simulation and real data analysis, we conclude that
the VC model cannot completely substitute the linear parametric
model in G><E analysis. Our practical recommendation is to do a
hypothesis test ﬁrst to assess the function of the coefﬁcients, then ﬁt
the appropriate model. In many cases, linear or constant coefﬁcients
are preferred, and a linear model can be ﬁtted. Noted that the
estimation of the varying coefﬁcients is essentially a least-squares
problem, hence is computationally fast. The computational cost
comes with the wild bootstrap procedure to assess the signiﬁcance
of the coefﬁcients. By ﬁrst assessing the function of the coefﬁcients,
we could save computation time dramatically.

We applied the method to a real dataset to identify genetic factors
interacting with mother’s MBI to explain the normal variation of
baby’s birth weight. We adopted a two-parameter model which
is biologically more attractive than a one-parameter model. We
found a few SNPs showing non-linear penetrance across different
environmental stimuli (i.e. different MBMI levels) (Table 1). Even
though only two SNPs showed statistical signiﬁcance after multiple
testing adjustments following the FDR procedure (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995), we still found a few others with relatively
strong signals (P<0.005). In checking the function of the SNPs,
some of those are growth factors that are directly related to fetal
growth, for example, platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB) and
ﬁbroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4). FGF4 is essential for mammalian
embryogenesis and fetal growth (Lamb and Rizzino, 1998). SNP
634043245 in exon 3 located in FGF4 was also identiﬁed by a
different model showing a strong dominance effect on small for
gestational age along with maternal body weight when searching
for genetic conﬂict effect (Li et al., 2009).

Like many other statistical methods in association analysis,
genotyping errors and missing data are certainly obvious issues as
pointed out by one referee. In the current analysis, we focused on
the model in a general setting. These issues need to be evaluated
with extensive simulations and will be considered in our ﬁiture
work. In addition to these two issues, our method does not apply
to rare variants either. Further model development is needed to take
rare variants into consideration. For SNPs with highly unbalanced

genotype distributions, a one-parameter additive model without the
dominance effect can be imposed if there is a singular issue in the
spline matrix during parameter estimation.

In this study, we focused on a continuous quantitative phenotype.
Extension to other types of phenotype such as a binary disease
phenotype is straightforward. A generalized linear model can be
adopted with appropriately chosen link function. However, the
estimation and inference procedure developed in this work cannot be
directly applied. Such investigation will be considered in our future
work.

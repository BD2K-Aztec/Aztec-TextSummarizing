Abstract

Summary: Several approaches to the region—based association analysis of quantitative traits have
recently been developed and successively applied. However, no software package has been de—
veloped that implements all of these approaches for either independent or structured samples.
Here we introduce FREGAT (Family REGional Association Tests), an R package that can handle
family and population samples and implements a wide range of region—based association methods
including burden tests, functional linear models, and kernel machine—based regression. FREGAT
can be used in genome/exome—wide region—based association studies of quantitative traits and
candidate gene analysis. FREGAT offers many useful options to empower its users and increase
the effectiveness and applicability of region—based association analysis.

1 Introduction

The development of new and effective whole-exome and whole-genome
resequencing technologies demands the establishment of powerful and
computationally efficient statistical methods to test the associations be-
tween rare variants and complex traits. The methods developed for the
analysis of common variants are underpowered because of the small
number of observations for any given variant (Eichler et (11., 2010). The
statistical power of the association analysis of rare variants is expected
to increase when genetic variants in a region of interest are tested simul-
taneously rather than separately (Eichler et (11., 2010).

Several approaches to the region-based association analysis of
quantitative traits have been developed and successively applied in
practice. The simplest approach uses various methods for collapsing
rare variants within a region of interest (burden tests). In this case, a
set of rare variants in a region is described by a single genetic vari-
able that is then tested for association (Dering et (11., 2011). Other

approaches wherein genotype effects are estimated as fixed effects
are based on the multiple regression model, especially on its func-
tional data analysis-based version (functional linear models, FLMs)
(Fan et (11., 2013, 2014). An alternative approach treats the regional
association as a random effect and employs kernel machine-based
regression (i.e. sequence kernel association tests, SKAT and SKAT-
O) (Kwee et (11., 2008; Lee et (11., 2012; Wu et (11., 2011).

Each of these methods has their own advantages and limitations.
All have been adopted for pedigree samples (Belonogova et (11., 2013;
Chen et (11., 2013; Feng et (11., 2015; Oualkacha et (11., 2013; Schifano
et (11., 2012; Svishcheva et (11., 2014, 2015). However, no software
package has yet been developed that implements all of these popular
approaches for handling population or family samples. We developed
the Family REGional Association Tests (PREGAT) package, an R
package that can handle population and family samples and imple-
ments a wide range of region-based association methods including

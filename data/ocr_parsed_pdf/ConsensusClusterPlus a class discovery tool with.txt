ABSTRACT

Summary: Unsupervised class discovery is a highly useful technique
in cancer research, where intrinsic groups sharing biological
characteristics may exist but are unknown. The consensus clustering
(CC) method provides quantitative and visual stability evidence
for estimating the number of unsupervised classes in a dataset.
ConsensusClusterPlus implements the CC method in R and extends
it with new functionality and visualizations including item tracking,
item-consensus and cluster-consensus plots. These new features
provide users with detailed information that enable more specific
decisions in unsupervised class discovery.

Availability: ConsensusClusterPlus is open source software, written
in R, under GPL-2, and available through the Bioconductor project
{http://www.bioconductor.org/).

1 INTRODUCTION

Unsupervised class discovery is a data mining technique for
the detection of unknown possible groups of items based on
intrinsic features and no external information. For this technique,
an investigator seeks to answer two questions: how many groups
are present in a dataset, and what is the conﬁdence in the number
of groups and the group memberships. Consensus clustering (CC)
(Monti et al., 2003) is a method for evaluating these questions and is
popular in cancer research [e.g. lung adenocarcinoma (Hayes et al.,
2006)]. CC provides quantitative and visual ‘stability’ evidence
derived from repeated subsampling and clustering. CC reports a
consensus of these repetitions, which is robust relative to sampling
variability. The CC method is available in the GenePattern software
(Reich et al., 2006). ConsensusClusterPlus implements the CC
method in the R language (http://www.r-project.org) and adds new
functionality and visualizations.

2 SOFTWARE FEATURES

Input to ConsensusClusterPlus is a data matrix and user-speciﬁed
options. The data matrix represents a collection of features for a set
of samples (items); for example, this could be microarray items and
gene expression features. Output is stability evidence for a given

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

number of groups (k) and cluster assignments. The output consists
of R data objects, text ﬁles, graphical plots and a log ﬁle.

2.1 Algorithm

ConsensusClusterPlus extends the CC algorithm and is brieﬂy
described here. The algorithm begins by subsampling a proportion
of items and a proportion of features from a data matrix. Each
subsample is then partitioned into up to k groups by a user-speciﬁed
clustering algorithm: agglomerative hierarchical clustering, k-means
or a custom algorithm. This process is repeated for a speciﬁed
number of repetitions. Pairwise consensus values, deﬁned as ‘the
proportion of clustering runs in which two items are [grouped]
together’ (Monti et al., 2003), are calculated and stored in a
consensus matrix (CM) for each k. Then for each k, a ﬁnal
agglomerative hierarchical consensus clustering using distance of
l—consensus values is completed and pruned to k groups, which
are called consensus clusters.

New features of ConsensusClusterPlus algorithm are the 2D
feature and item subsampling, which can be performed according
to particular distributions such as gene variability, and the option
for a custom clustering algorithm. The 2D subsampling provides
assessments of clusters’ sensitivity to both item and feature sampling
variability. Because a custom clustering algorithm can be used to
generate consensus, users can utilize the many existing clustering
algorithms available in R or can write their own.

2.2 Output and visualizations

ConsensusClusterPlus produces graphical plots extending the CC
visualizations. For each k, CM plots depict consensus values
on a white to blue colour scale, are ordered by the consensus
clustering which is shown as a dendrogram, and have items’
consensus clusters marked by coloured rectangles between the
dendrogram and consensus values (Fig. 1A). This new feature
of ConsensusClusterPlus enables quick and accurate visualization of
cluster boundaries, which are not labelled in CC. The purpose of CM
plots is to ﬁnd the ‘cleanest’ cluster partition where items nearly
always either cluster together giving a high consensus (dark blue
colour) or do not cluster together giving a low consensus (white).
Empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots display
consensus distributions for each k (Fig. 1C). The purpose of the CDF
plot is to ﬁnd the k at which the distribution reaches an approximate
maximum, which indicates a maximum stability and after which
divisions are equivalent to random picks rather than true cluster
structure.

The item tracking plot (Fig. 1B) shows the consensus cluster of
items (in columns) at each k (in rows). This allows a user to track an
item’s cluster assignments across different k, to identify promiscuous
items that are suggestive of weak class membership, and to visualize
the distribution of cluster sizes across k (Supplementary Fig. l for
example of promiscuous samples). This plot is similar to colour
maps (Hoffmann et al., 2007). Item-consensus (IC) is the average
consensus value between an item and members of a consensus
cluster, so that there are multiple IC values for an item at a k
corresponding to the k clusters. IC plots display items as vertical bars
of coloured rectangles whose height corresponds to IC values (Fig.
1D). Consensus clusters of items are marked by coloured asterisks
atop the bars. IC plots enable a user to view which samples are highly
representative of a cluster and which samples have mixed cluster
association and to possibly select cluster-representative samples.
Cluster-consensus (CLC) is the average pairwise IC of items in a
consensus cluster. The CLC plot displays these values as a bar plot
that are grouped at each k (Fig. 1E). The CLC plots enable a user to

assess the impact adding a new cluster on the CLC values of existing
clusters. The colour schemes between the CM, item tracking, IC and
CLC plots are coordinated which enable cross-plot analysis. The
colour scheme is deﬁned by the rule that clusters at a k are given
the same colour as a cluster at k — 1 if the majority of their members
are shared. Otherwise, a new colour is assigned.

3 EXAMPLE APPLICATION

For demonstration, we obtained published lung cancer gene
expression microarrays (Garber et al., 2001). We selected
microarrays of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or normal
histologies and sought to rediscover these known classes. We
executed ConsensusClusterPlus which resulted in four clusters.
These discovered clusters correspond to the pre-selected classes
(Supplementary Table l and Fig. 2). Two clusters completely contain
and segregate squamous cell carcinoma and normal histologies.
Adenocarcinoma is spread over the four clusters and is the only
histology in two clusters. Adenocarcinoma’s expression diversity is
consistent with the earlier reports (Garber et al., 2001; Hayes et al.,
2006). As an integrity check, we executed GenePattern CC with the
same input and found identical cluster assignments.

The item tracking plot showed cluster assignments were stable
and that new clusters at k > 4 are small. The IC plot showed that
some items with mixed IC (bars with appreciable light blue and dark
blue portions) at k = 2 become a new cluster at k = 3 (coloured light
green) (Fig. 1D). CLC plots at k=4 showed reasonably high CLC
among the clusters (Fig. 1E). The item tracking, IC and CLC data
were useful in deciding cluster number and could be used to select
representative samples for further analysis.

4 CONCLUSIONS

ConsensusClusterPlus is open source, Bioconductor-compatible
software for unsupervised class discovery. ConsensusClusterPlus
extends CC with new, easy-to-use functionality and visualizations
that enable detailed analysis.

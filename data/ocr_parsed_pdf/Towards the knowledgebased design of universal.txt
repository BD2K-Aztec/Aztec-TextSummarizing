Abstract

Motivation: Influenza A viral heterogeneity remains a significant threat due to unpredictable anti—
genic drift in seasonal influenza and antigenic shifts caused by the emergence of novel subtypes.
Annual review of multivalent influenza vaccines targets strains of influenza A and B likely to be pre—
dominant in future influenza seasons. This does not induce broad, cross protective immunity
against emergent subtypes. Better strategies are needed to prevent future pandemics. Cross—
protection can be achieved by activating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells against highly conserved regions
of the influenza genome. We combine available experimental data with informatics—based im—
munological predictions to help design vaccines potentially able to induce cross—protective T—cells
against multiple influenza subtypes.

Results: To exemplify our approach we designed two epitope ensemble vaccines comprising highly
conserved and experimentally verified immunogenic influenza A epitopes as putative non—seasonal
influenza vaccines; one specifically targets the US population and the other is a universal vaccine.
The USA—specific vaccine comprised 6 CD8+T cell epitopes (GILGFVFTL, FMYSDFHFI,
GMDPRMCSL, SVKEKDMTK, FYIOMCTEL, DTVNRTHOY) and 3 CD4+ epitopes (KGILGFVFTLTVPSE,
EYIMKGVYINTALLN, ILGFVFTLTVPSERG). The universal vaccine comprised 8 CD8+ epitopes:
(FMYSDFHFI, GILGFVFTL, ILRGSVAHK, FYIOMCTEL, ILKGKFOTA, YYLEKAN Kl, VSDGGPNLY,
YSHGTGTGY) and the same 3 CD4+ epitopes. Our USA—specific vaccine has a population protection
coverage (portion ofthe population potentially responsive to one or more component epitopes ofthe
vaccine, PPC) of over 96 and 95% coverage of observed influenza subtypes. The universal vaccine
has a PPC value of over 97 and 88% coverage of observed subtypes.

Influenza is an infectious acute respiratory disease caused by
single—negative—strand RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae,
within which three genera—Inﬂuenzavirus A, Inﬂuenzavims B and
Inﬂuenzavirus C—contain viral strains corresponding to influenza
types A, B and C, respectively (ICTV, 2015; http://ictvonline.org/
virusTaxonomy.asp). Treatment when necessary includes antivirals to
relieve symptoms and reduce complications. However, prevention
through vaccination is currently the most effective strategy to combat
influenza viruses (Schotsaert and Garcia—Sastre, 2014).

Only influenza A has both seasonal epidemic and pandemic cap—
ability and is classified into subtypes according to its hemagglutinin
(HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoprotein antigens (Zhang
et al., 2015). Influenza A caused the Spanish (1918—1919), Asian
(1957) and Hong Kong (1968) flu pandemics, which all led to global
mortality in the millions (Kilbourne, 2006), as well as the milder
2009 pandemic. Pandemic strains from both 2009 (H1N1) and
1968 (H3N2) continue to circulate as seasonal influenza maintained
by antigenic drift where mutations occur on the antigenic binding
sites of NA and HA. However, pandemic strains arise through anti—
genic shifts, where a new subtype emerges via gene re—assortment
after distinct influenza viruses co—infect an intermediate host.

Seasonal flu vaccines are mediated by antibody responses against
NA and HA proteins, which unfortunately are highly variable; the
large numbers of annual deaths continues to raise serious questions
about the effectiveness of current vaccines and vaccination strategies
(World Health Organisation [WHO], 2009; http://www.who.int/
csr/don/2009_09_18/en/). Formulating a ‘universal vaccine’ where
multiple strains are targeted to induce so—called heterosubtypic im—
munity (HSI) may prove more effective in combating novel strains
before they can go on to cause pandemics (Nguyen et al., 2007).

Studies in animal models have suggested that generating cellular
immunity via T cell responses may induce broad, cross—reactive pro—
tection that current vaccines apparently lack. T cells target exposed
and non—exposed proteins that are processed and presented by
Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLAs). There are two main types of T
cells: cytotoxic CD8+ T cell lymphocytes (CTLs) and CD4+. CTLs
recognize antigens presented by HLA class I (HLA I) molecules
while CD4 T cell recognize antigens presented by HLA class II
(HLA II) molecules. The role of CTL in cellular immunity includes
the direct clearance of virally infected cells and the indirect recruit—
ment of other immune cells via chemokine and cytokine secretion.
CD4+ T cells’ primary roles include B cell stimulation leading to
specific antigen antibody production as well as stimulating CD8+
proliferation and memory responses. CD4+ T cells also mediate dir—
ect and indirect viral clearance, and symptom severity reduction in
secondary infection (Chen et al., 2014).

Many targets for influenza vaccine—development have been
investigated, including those inducing T cell and/or B cell responses;
e.g. the highly conserved ‘stalk’ domain of HA, termed HA2
(Khanna et al. 2014). Other evidence has implicated nucleoprotein
(NP) and Matrix 1 (M1) as vaccine targets capable of inducing cross
protection via enhanced T cell activation (Antrobus et al., 2014a,b).

Another potential vaccine target is influenza matrix protein 2
(M2e). Initially this seemed highly conserved and induced broadly
acting antibodies. However, over 20 variants of M2e were later
identified in newly emerging influenza A strains, raising questions
over its usefulness as a ‘universal’ vaccine. Nevertheless, regions of
M2e may still be useful for inducing broadly acting protection
(Gottlieb and Ben—Yedidia, 2014).

Conserved targets would be useful in formulating a ‘universal’
vaccine, as they would cover multiple viral subtypes (Brown and
Kelso, 2009). Such ‘universal’ vaccine design can potentially be

addressed by a T—cell epitope ensemble vaccine comprising short,
highly conserved, immunogenic peptides from influenza able to acti—
vate T cells. Some epitope—based influenza vaccines are already in
clinical trials. One, Multimeric—001, which consists of a single
recombinant protein composed of B and T cell epitopes, is seen to
induce both cellular and humoral immunity (Atsmon et al., 2014;
Gottlieb and Ben—Yedidia, 2014). Although such trials have been
small, they are promising, inducing cross protective immunity with—
out severe side effects.

We address here the design of epitope ensemble vaccines that
have wide coverage of the human population in terms of HLA bind—
ing and wide coverage of different viral subtypes. Such an approach
draws strong support from both theoretical studies (Schubert et al.,
2013) and from a wealth of recent experimentally verified vaccines
developed with concordant goals, including inter alia filoviruses
(Fenimore et al., 2012), HIV (Ondondo et al., 2016), Dengue virus
(Nascimento et al., 2013), Survivin (Hoffmann et al., 2015) and
Metapneumovirus (Li et al., 2015).

In what follows, we expand on an emerging paradigm within ra—
tional vaccine design (Molero—Abraham et al., 2013) to include class
II epitopes, and identify multiple, conserved influenza A T cell epi—
topes that together comprise putative non—seasonal flu vaccines.

2 Methods

2.1 Collection of influenza A specific epitopes

Influenza A CD8+ and CD4+ T cell epitopes known to induce im—
mune responses during natural infection were initially collected
from the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource [IEDB]
(Peters et al., 2005). Inclusion criteria restricted the data to peptides
giving positive T—cell assay results and restricted by HLA molecules.
In addition, for CD8+ epitopes we only considered those with 9
residues because most known epitopes processed by class I HLA are
9—mers (Reche et al., 2004).

2.2 Collection, clustering and multiple sequence
alignment of influenza A polyproteins

To generate a multiple sequence alignment (MSA), full length influ—
enza A polyproteins were collected from the Influenza Viral
Resource at the National Centre for Biotechnology Information
[NCBI] (Bao et al., 2008) and Influenza Research Database (Squires
et al., 2012). Identical sequences were removed to prevent bias when
identifying conserved regions. Incomplete sequences were also omit—
ted. Sequence sets corresponding to 12 different influenza A specific
proteins were processed: each was submitted to two clustering web
servers to remove redundant sequences: BLASTclust (http://toolkit.
tuebingen.mpg.de/blastclust) (Altschul et al., 1990) and CD—HIT
(http://weizhong—lab.ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi—bin/index.cgi?cmd:
cd—hit) (Fu et al., 2012). To reduce sequence bias, the two clustering
servers were used separately in two repeated cycles. Sequences for
each influenza A protein type were clustered with 96—99% sequence
similarity. Once clustered, MSA outputs were created using the mul—
tiple sequence alignment package MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004).

2.3 Variability analysis of influenza A polyproteins

For each influenza protein, MSA data were subjected to sequence vari—
ability analysis using the Protein Variability Server [PVS] (Garcia—
Boronat et al., 2008). We selected the Shannon entropy (H) as the
variability metric (Stewart et al., 1997) and a variability threshold of
0.5. Shannon entropy values range from 4.3 (all amino acids equally
represented at a site) to 0.0 (invariant site with only one allowed

residue). As a result, we obtained consensus sequences with variable
positions, H > 0, masked. Subsequently, we selected as conserved epi—
topes those that matched precisely over their entire length with the
generated consensus sequences. Thereby, we retained only those epi—
topes in which no amino—acid position had H > 0.5.

2.4 Calculation of population protection coverage

The PPC of T cell epitope ensembles equals the cumulative pheno—
typic frequency of the HLA alleles restricting the T cell epitopes and
can be computed using the genetic frequencies of the relevant HLA
alleles within the population. In this study, the PPC of HLA I—re—
stricted epitopes was calculated using EPISOPT v.1 (http://imed.
med.ucm.es/EPISOPT.html) and the IEDB PPC prediction tool
(http://tools.immuneepitope.org/tools/population/iedb_input).
EPISOPT computes PPC in one step after predicting epitope—HLA I
binding profiles using HLA I frequencies for the five main ethnic
groups present in the USA population (Black, Caucasian, Hispanic,
Asian and native North American) (Cao et al., 2001). The IEDB
tool requires manual entry of HLA I binding profiles which we first
obtained using the IEDB class I HLA binding prediction server
(http://tools.immuneepitope.org/mhci/). A class I HLA reference set
was used as these alleles were frequently found in the population
(Weiskopf et al., 2013). This allowed a PPC to be calculated for
class I HLA data of the world’s population rather than just the five
USA ethnicities. Class I HLA binding profiles included all those al—
leles that were predicted to bind the peptide for the top 1% percent—
ile rank for all peptides in the relevant antigen.

For each CD4+ T epitopes, we predicted HLA II binding affinities
to different alleles found in the human population (Greenbaum et al.,
2011) using IEDB (http://tools.i1mnuneepitope.orgmhcii/). Many
other prediction methods are available (Soria—Guerra et al., 2015 ). We
used a 10% percentile rank cutoff to select the targeted alleles. These
were then submitted to the IEDB PPC tool, allowing calculation of
PPC for the world population rather than specific ethnicities.

3 Results

We collected from the IEDB 210 CD8+ and 816 CD4+ T cell influ—
enza A—specific epitopes, of length 8—18 residues, known to be tar—
geted during natural infection. We also collected influenza A
proteins and clustered them using BLASTclust and CD—HIT (details
in Material and Methods), obtaining two different cluster sets, and
two different sets of conserved regions, one from BLASTclust and
the other from CD—HIT. We used these conserved regions to identify
matching conserved T cell epitopes.

First, we examined CD8+ T cell epitopes, identifying 11 con—
served epitopes common to both sets of conserved regions.
Additionally, two extra epitopes were identified in the BLASTclust
set (GILGFVFTL, IRHENRMVL) and another two from CD—HIT
(RGINDRNFW, YINTALLNA). EPISOPT was used to select
CD8+ T cell epitopes for our USA—specific vaccine. Table 1 lists
calculated non—zero PPC values for CD8+ epitopes generated by
the server.

To reach a PPC > 80% a minimum of two epitopes were needed.
To achieve a PPC > 95% at least six epitopes are required. EPISOPT
identified four different combinations of which two combinations
reached a PPC of 95.7% and the other two 95.4%. We selected set
one to define the CD 8+ arm of our USA—specific ensemble vaccine.

We collected 816 influenza A CD4+ T cell epitopes from the
IEDB database and selected 7 conserved CD4+ T cell epitopes by
comparing with the conserved regions identified by BLASTClust

and CD—HIT clustering routes were used. These conserved epitopes
of varying amino acid length were submitted to IEDB the class II
HLA binding prediction tool (Table 2). Many epitopes did not bind
to any alleles within the top 10% percentile rank and of those that
did only one epitope, TGTGYTMDTVNRTHQ, was identified by
both BLASTclust and CD—HIT. Three additional epitopes
were identified by BLASTclust (KGILGFVFTLTVPSE,
ILGFVFTLTVPSERG and NPLIRHENRMVLAST) and three by
CD—HIT (TYQRTRALVRTGMDP, MAFLEESHPGIFENS and
EYIMKGVYINTALLN).

All epitope—HLA II binding profiles were then entered into the
IEDB PPC tool for analysis. NPLIRHENRMVLAST, TGTGYTMD
TVNRTHQ, TYQRTRALVRTGMDP and MAFLEESHPGIFENS
have class II HLA binding profiles that are completely covered by
the other three remaining epitopes and therefore they were not con—
sidered when calculating PPC with multiple CD4+ T cell epitopes.
The remaining three CD4+ T cell epitopes gave a combined PPC of
76.4%. The resulting combination of selected CD8+ and CD4+ epi—
topes form a population—weighted potential candidate USA—specific
multiple epitope ensemble vaccine capable of inducing region—
specific cross protection against influenza A (Table 3).

Table 3 lists the CD8+ and CD4+ epitopes comprising our
USA—specific vaccine, together with origin, individual PPC and HLA
class II allelic binding restriction.

To derive the equivalent universal vaccine, the class I HLA
binding profiles of each epitope were predicted using the IEDB
class I HLA binding prediction tool. We then used the IEDB PPC
tool to estimate PPC values against the world population, rather
than the North American—only coverage provided by EPISOPT.
GMDPRMCSL, YINTALLNA and IRHENRMVL were excluded
as they did not bind to any class I HLA allele within the top 1%
percentile rank. Excluding those epitopes that gave a PPC of 0%,
a maximum PPC of 91.04% was possible with the remaining 12
CD8+ epitopes. This was different result to EPISOPT v.1, where
just 6 epitopes gave a PPC > 95%. This reflects the lesser diversity
within the North America population compared to the world

PPC>10% using the IEDB PPC tool were considered; and to—
gether reached a PPC value of 90.2%. These constituted the
CD8+ component of our universal influenza vaccine (Table 4).
The selected CD4+ and CD8+ epitopes were combined together
to calculate a PPC against both class I HLA and class II HLA al—
leles against the world’s population using the IEDB PPC tool
(Table 4). A total PPC of 97.7% was achieved. The selected T cell
epitopes form a population—weighted potential multiple epitope en—
semble vaccine able to induce broad, global, cross—protection
against influenza A.

Table 4 lists the CD8+ and CD4+ epitopes comprising our glo—
bal vaccine, together with origin, individual PPC and HLA class II

We have intentionally not specifically targeted subtypes.
However, due to their wide sequence conservation, the identified
epitopes are well represented across most major subtypes. Apart
from subtypes of influenza A unique to bats, there are 16 haem—
agglutinin and 9 neuraminidase subtypes transmissible to humans
making 144 possible H”“N”r combinations, of which 128 have been
observed in the wild, as indicated by the presence of at least one des—
ignated sequence in the Influenza Virus Resource (Bao et al., 2008),
as of February 2016. BLASTing each of our 9 USA—specific vaccine
epitopes against Orthomyxoviridae (taxid:11308) sequences within
the non—redundant NCBI protein database, generated sets of 100%
identical matches to sequences from distinct H”“N”r subtypes, rang—
ing in number from 95 H”“N”r subtypes (GILGFVFTL) to 111 sub—
types (SVKEKDMTK). As a whole, the USA—specific vaccine has

CD8+ and CD4+ epitopes comprising our global vaccine, together with origin, individual PPC and HLA class II allelic binding restriction.

sequence matches to a total of 117 distinct H”“N”r sub—types. This in—
dicates that the vaccine has a high coverage (95%) of observed influ—
enza subtypes. BLASTing the 11 universal vaccine epitopes against
Orthomyxoviridae sequences, produced 100% identical matches to
distinct H”“N”r subtypes, which ranged in number from 93
(KGILGFVFTLTVPSE) to 108 (FMYSDFHFI). The universal vac—
cine matches 113 H”“N”r sub—types, again indicating a high overall
coverage (88%) of observed subtypes. Identifying additional highly
subtype—specific conservation might enhance our putative universal
Influenza A vaccine further, as adding a cocktail of strain—specific
epitopes may strengthen cross—protection within our putative epi—
tope ensemble.

No single epitope vaccine would not provide universal protection
against heterosubtypic influenza A strains. No single peptide vaccines,
reinforcing the need to examine multiple conserved epitopes.
Individually, no single peptide gave a PPC greater >90% however,
such values were achieved when combining epitopes. It is evident
from a comparison of EPISOPT and IEDB that generated PPC values
are method—dependent, with alternative allele frequencies and calcula—
tion strategies yielding different values. Nonetheless, high consensus
values, as derived here, indicate the value of this approach as a fully
validated starting point for vaccine design. Ideally, epitopes with a
broad allele specificity would be assayed experimentally against well—
understood alleles representative of class I and class II supertypes
(Doytchinova and Flower, 2005; Doytchinova et al., 2005).

All T cell epitopes included in the final vaccine combination
were either part of polymerase acidic protein (PA), nucleoprotein
(NP), matrix 1 protein (M1) or polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1).
The large PPC value found for GILGFVFTL located on M1 protein
is not surprising as previous research concluded it was broadly rec—
ognized by the population (Alexander et al., 2010a). It is known to
be immunodominant when restricted by HLA—A02 and other evi—
dence suggests degenerate recognition by CTL when restricted by
HLA—C08 (Choo et al., 2014). In cellular immunity, immunodomi—
nance refers to the observation that while many peptides can be pre—
sented by host cells, a larger portion of T cells focus their attention
on a very limited number of HLA—presented peptides. Such evidence,

together with our results, supports the view that the epitope will be
useful in providing broad protection against distinct influenza A
strains.

NP has long been considered a viable option for inducing cross
protective CTL in humans and mice; many studies have sought to
ensure NP—based vaccines are immunogenic enough to be cross pro—
tective. These include priming with DNA vaccines containing NP
(Epstein et al., 2005) alone or combined with other conserved pro—
teins such as NS1 and M1 (Zhirnov et al., 2007) followed by boost—
ing with recombinant NP derived from E.coli. In animal models, all
show promise, with cross—reactive T cell responses against influenza
A subtypes observed at many levels. A vaccine consisting of modi—
fied vaccinia virus Ankara vector, M1 and NP (MVA—NP + M1) has
also been tested in clinical trials involving healthy adults (Huang
et al., 2012). The MVA—NP+ M1 vaccine yields much higher T cell
responses compared to other influenza vaccines, as well as being
safe in animal models and human trials. T cell responses were
boosted when combined with seasonal vaccination compared to sea—
sonal vaccination alone suggesting seasonal vaccines may still prove
a useful component in future universal vaccines (Antrobus et al.,
2014a,b; Berthoud et al., 201 1).

Alexander et al. (2010b) also identified FMYSDFHFI,
FYIQMCTEL, YYLEKANKI, GILGFVFTL and YSHGTGTGY as
CD8+ epitopes for use in cross protective vaccines. Similar to our
results, each binds extensively within a particular class I HLA super—
type: FMYSDFHFI, A2; FYIQMCTEL, A24; YYLEKANKI, A24;
GILGFVFTL, A2 and YSHGTGTGY, A1. These epitopes were con—
served in over 93% of 69 distinct influenza strains and 100% con—
served in 10 swine flu H1N1 strains. All these epitopes produce
good CTL responses in donors expressing the relevant class I HLA
alleles. The similarity of derived epitopes coupled to their high con—
servation among a diverse group of influenza A strains, suggests
such epitopes will prove viable targets for future influenza A epitope
vaccine formulations.

None of these highly conserved CD8+ or CD4+ T cell epitopes
were found in hemagglutinin (H) or neuraminidase (N). While it is
often assumed wrongly that H or N epitopes are all important, this

is not the case with T—cell responses. While N and H are the key pro—
teins for antibody binding, cellular immunity can respond to viral in—
fection before viral shedding, opening the whole influenza genome
to immune surveillance. The absence of N and H epitopes is ex—
plained by the low sequence conservation between different strains
(Chen and Deng, 2009), due to the highly variable antigen binding
sites that allow antibody immune evasion.

Recent studies suggest immunodominant influenza epitopes are
less conserved generally than their subdominant counterparts, which
is thought to result from immune pressure (Chen et al., 2014).
Immunodominant epitopes are likely to give the greatest immune re—
sponse. Some of our epitopes may be subdominant potentially
reducing their ability to induce potent immune responses. However,
immunodominance hierarchies are dynamic and can be altered by
vaccination (Welsh et al., 2010). Any peptide that is efficiently pro—
cessed and presented in both target and antigen—presenting cells are
good candidates for vaccines regardless of their immunodominance.
Only subdominance resulting from failures of processing or from
poor binding to MHCs would lead to an ineffective vaccine.
However, the epitopes we selected are likely to be processed in vivo
as they are known to be targeted during a natural infection and ex—
hibit high predicted MHC binding.

While the performance of many class I binding algorithms has re—
cent improved significantly, class II predictions remain poor or in—
consistent (Lafuente and Reche, 2009). Since class II HLA have
open—ended binding sites, they can bind peptides with a much
broader length distribution than class I. The lower quality perform—
ance compared to class I HLA prediction increases the likelihood of
identifying false—positive CD4+ T cell epitopes (Nielsen et al.,
2010). In this study, CD8+ epitopes were restricted to 9—mer epi—
topes, even though class I HLA molecules can present a significant
number of peptides of other lengths (MacDonald et al., 2010).
Although most known class I HLA specific peptides are 9—mers, and
class I HLA binding predictions of peptides of other lengths are not
as reliable (Lundegaard et al., 2010), many immunogenic CD8+ epi—
topes of length other than 9 are known: for example, Alexander
et al. (2010) identified multiple 10—mer, influenza A specific CD8+
epitopes. Future studies might therefore usefully include epitopes of
different lengths.

The list of epitopes identified here does not, in itself, constitute
the entirety of a deployable vaccine. Constructing a multiple epitope
ensemble vaccine is often problematic as they are seldom sufficiently
immunogenic. Short peptides suffer from poor immunogenicity and
therefore vaccines require additional components to help initiate T
cell responses. Epitopes must be delivered, packaged into a stable
vaccine formulation (Yang and Kim, 2015). Epitopes can be de—
livered as poly—epitope peptide(s) or as part of a viral vector. In ei—
ther case, the order of epitopes and the presence of cleavage sites,
etc. is crucial. Schubert and Kohlbacher (2016) have, for example,
addressed how to optimize this process. The typical lack of immuno—
genicity of such constructs is notable (Mahanty et al., 2015), and
much empirical work—including optimizing the number and tim—
ings of vaccination—is necessary to address this (De Groot et al.,
2005a,b). The main way to do this is by addition of adjuvants to the
formulation (Bayry et al., 2008).

Our approach has focused on designing the so—called biological
component of a vaccine, the part responsible—through molecular
recognition events—for engendering the specificity of vaccine re—
sponses. Issues will need to be addressed, including the synergistic
orchestration of both the mechanistic targeting and/or co—uptake of
vaccine components and the optimal logistics of vaccination proto—
cols, such as chosen regimen and the size, number and frequency of

vaccinations (Moyer et al., 2016). In this regard, computational
modelling frameworks have much to offer, allowing us to predict
overall immune system response dynamics and pharmacokinetics
that should allow us to optimize memory effects and the dosing of
vaccine administration (Pappalardo et al., 2014).

4 Conclusion

A ‘universal’ vaccine would ideally induce immunity against all or
most influenza A subtypes. However, as influenza continually
evolves, formulating a vaccine with such broad protection remains
problematic. Current seasonal influenza vaccines lack the ability to
induce cellular immunity and instead induce strain specific humoral
immunity where novel or differing influenza strains can easily by—
pass immune recognition. In this study, multiple, conserved T cell
epitopes were identified using immunoinformatics. The combination
of epitopes identified here should be able to induce broad heterosub—
typic, protection against influenza A across the global population
(PPC: 97.7%) or in geographically restricted populations, in this
case the USA (PPC:96.3%). Our putative vaccines contain both
CD8+ and CD4+ epitopes, as both types of T cells play important
roles in viral clearance. Although all identified epitopes are known
to be immunoreactive, further studies are needed to assess their effi—
cacy. The extent of cross protection will require further analysis to
verify the efficacy against particular influenza A subtypes. Despite
these limitations the results are a promising vindication of our ap—
proach, and the extensions we detail, should prove of interest in fu—
ture influenza vaccination strategies.

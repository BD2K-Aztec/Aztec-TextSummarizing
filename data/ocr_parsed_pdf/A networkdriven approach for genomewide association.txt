Abstract

Motivation: It remains a challenge to detect associations between genotypes and phenotypes be—
cause of insufficient sample sizes and complex underlying mechanisms involved in associations.
Fortunately, it is becoming more feasible to obtain gene expression data in addition to genotypes
and phenotypes, giving us new opportunities to detect true genotype—phenotype associations
while unveiling their association mechanisms.

Results: In this article, we propose a novel method, NETAM, that accurately detects associations
between SNPs and phenotypes, as well as gene traits involved in such associations. We take a
network—driven approach: NETAM first constructs an association network, where nodes represent
SNPs, gene traits or phenotypes, and edges represent the strength of association between two
nodes. NETAM assigns a score to each path from an SNP to a phenotype, and then identifies sig—
nificant paths based on the scores. In our simulation study, we show that NETAM finds significantly
more phenotype—associated SNPs than traditional genotype—phenotype association analysis under
false positive control, taking advantage of gene expression data. Furthermore, we applied NETAM
on late—onset Alzheimer's disease data and identified 477 significant path associations, among
which we analyzed paths related to beta—amyloid, estrogen, and nicotine pathways. We also pro—

 

vide hypothetical biological pathways to explain our findings.

1 Introduction

One of the fundamental problems in genetics is to understand how
different genotypes affect phenotypic variations. To find genetic fac-
tors of complex diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
asthma, researchers have detected single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) associated with phenotypes (e.g. disease status) (Corder
et (11., 1993). However, most SNPs associated with complex diseases
remain elusive, and the molecular mechanisms of genotype—pheno-
type associations are largely unknown (Kim and Przytycka, 2012;
Manolio et (11., 2009). To address the problem, efforts have been
made in the past decade to bridge the gap between genotypes and
phenotypes by replacing phenotypes with gene expression traits
(Gilad et (11., 2008), and then conducting association mapping be-
tween genotypes and gene expression traits. For example, hypothesis
testing (e.g. t-test) or penalized regression methods have been em-
ployed to find genotype—gene trait associations (Kendziorski et (11.,
2006; Lee and Xing, 2012).

Extending the two-way association (i.e. genotypes and gene
traits) analysis, three-way association analysis among genotypes,
gene traits and phenotypes also has been proposed. Schadt et al.

(2005) proposed an integrative genomics approach consisting of a
series of statistical tests to identify causal genes to complex pheno-
types. Recently, Curtis et a1. (2012) developed a visualization-aided
approach to detect genome—transcriptome—phenome associations.
The previous works showed the great promise of three-way associ-
ation analysis; however, most of them aim to reveal association rela-
tionships for an SNP, a gene trait, and a phenotype. Thus, there is
an urgent need to develop an efficient method that can detect three-
way associations from a large dataset of genotypes, gene traits, and
phenotypes.

In this article, we present a novel method, NETAM (NETwork-
driven Association Mapping), to detect ‘path associations’ from
SNPs to phenotypes through gene expression traits. Let us first
introduce the concept of path associations. Consider a network
where nodes represent SNPs, gene traits, or phenotypes and edges
represent associations between a pair of nodes, weighted by their
strengths. We call it association network. In this network, we define
path association by any paths from an SNP to a phenotype. Figure 1
illustrates an example of association network, identified by NETAM
in AD dataset (Zhang et (11., 2013). NETAM starts with constructing
an association network using sparse regression methods such as

To deal with categorical values, one can easily replace it with
multi—class logistic loss. Let B" and D" be the solutions for
Equations (1) and (2). Then, if  9E 0 (or (dﬁf 9E 0), we interpret
that the edge between the /—th SNP and the k—th gene trait exists (or
edge between the k—th gene trait and the m—th phenotype exists).
Edges between genotypes and phenotypes can be found using
Equation (2) by replacing Y with X.

Popular instances of SRMs include lasso and group lasso: Lasso
uses [1 regularizer, i.e. Q(P) : 2,, 2,22]- lplkl, where 2,, is the regular—
ization parameter determining the level of sparsity; group lasso uses
21/22 regularizer, i.e. Q(P) : 2,, Akzgeg ergllpgllz, where Q is a set
of groups of SNPs or traits and Hg is the size of group g. In practice,
we determine it using cross—validation; however, with cross—
validation, we often obtain many false positives (i.e. true zero coeffi—
cients are non—zero in estimated coefficients). To address this prob—
lem, we use SRMs under stability selection, which shall be described
in the next section.

Note that different regularizers incorporate different types of
prior knowledge into the model. For example, group lasso takes a
set of SNP groups, and finds groups of SNPs associated with traits.
If we define groups of SNPs based on their genomic locations (e.g.
SNPs located within a gene form a group g), group lasso encourages
that all SNPs within a gene are selected or discarded jointly.

2.1.2 Stability selection for false positive control
We augment Equations (1) and (2) with stability selection
(Meinshausen and Bﬁhlmann, 2010) to make edges in the graph.
Stability selection is a bootstrapping—type algorithm that effectively
controls false positives. Briefly, stability selection works as follows:
Equation (1) or (2) is run on randomly selected subsamples of size
(N/2j for T times, and then stability selection takes SNPs whose co—
efficients are non—zero for 2 Tm)” times, where nth, is a user—defined
parameter. We summarize sparse regression under stability selection
in Algorithm 1.

Let us discuss user—defined parameters T and 71,)”. We confirmed
that T 2 100 is sufficient to achieve false positive control, as re—
ported in Meinshausen and Biihlmann (2010). In practice, nth, is

chosen between 0.5 and 1; the larger 71,)”, the better false positive
control at the cost of decreased true positive rate. In theory, under
certain conditions, the relationship between the number of false
positives and nth, has been established. When finding edges between
SNPs and the k—th trait,

2

qr
E(Vk) < k

_ Tm _ 17. (3)

where E(Vk) is the expected number of falsely detected SNPs for the
k—th trait, and qg; is the number of nonzero coefficients found by a
SRM with 2:. Equation (3) shows that the upper bound on the num—
ber of false positives is inversely proportional to 71,)”.

Stability selection provides edges and their weights (called edge
scores), reflecting their degrees of significance. For association be—
tween the j—th SNP and the k—th trait, edge score TI;2 is defined by the
proportion of the cases where the /—th SNP is selected to the total
number of random sampling, as shown in Algorithm 1 (no edge
exists if the score is zero). To rank path associations, we further as—
sign scores to paths based on edge scores as follows:

score(Pathi) : H score(Edge). (4)
Edgegl’ath,

where score(Edge) is the score associated with Edge. The scoring
scheme in Equation (4) is motivated by the fact that a path association
is significant when all edges involved in the path are significant.

2.1.3 Screening algorithms for efficient computations

Stability selection is computationally expensive because it requires
multiple runs of a SRM. This is particularly problematic when find—
ing edges (i.e. associations) between genotypes and gene expression
traits at whole—genome scale (e.g. for human genomes, we need to
solve 1:500 000 dimensional regression problem on K220 000
gene expression traits for T: 100 times); thus, in this section, we
focus on solving Equation (1) efficiently. To address the computa—
tional challenge, we adopt a screening approach. The key idea of
screening is to discard SNPs whose coefficients are zero using simple
rules, and then solve a sparse regression problem with the un—
screened SNPs. Screening provides a substantial speed—up because
we only need to solve Equation (1) with a small number of SNPs
that survived after screening.

We note that two types of screening algorithms exist: one is
exact, such as dual polytope projections (DPP) rules (Wang et al.,
2013), and the other is non—exact, such as sure—screening and strong
rules (Fan and Lv, 2008; Tibshirani et al., 2012). Exact screening
guarantees that non—zero coefficients in a global optimal solution
(i.e. solution obtained by solving Equation (1) without screening)
are not discarded. Thus, the solution for Equation (1) obtained with
exact screening is the same as the one without screening. In contrast,
non—exact screening may mistakenly discard non—zero coefficients in
a global optimal solution; at the cost of non—exactness, it can discard
more SNPs than exact ones.

Here we briefly introduce DPP rules for lasso and group lasso.
For lasso, DPP discards the /—th SNP for the k—th trait if

beta—amyloid synthesis, which increases the risk of AD. Figure 5 il—
lustrates our hypothesis for the path association.

We observed that P—value for association between rs675 804 and
the AD status is 0.0049 computed by single SNP analysis. This small
P—value also suggests that rs675 804 is associated with AD through
IYD.

4.2.2 Path: r52833249 (GRIK1) —> ZNF720 (APP) —> AD

This is an interesting path association with cis—effect. Notably, the
SNP rs2833249 (chr21:31358680), GRIK1 (chr21:30909253—
31312282), and APP (chr21:27252860-27342862) are located
nearby in the genome. GRIK1 (glutamate receptor, ionotropic, kai—
nate 1) is a gene encoding a member of glutamate receptors, i.e. pre—
dominant excitatory neurotransmitter receptors (Maglott et al.,
2005), and GRIKl’s association with AD was reported in Tan et al.
(2010). Furthermore, we observed a small P—value 0.0046 for associ—
ation between rs2833249 and the AD status phenotype, supporting
the direction of this path from the SNP to the phenotype.
Combining these presents two possible scenarios. One is that
r52833249 affects GRIK1 levels, which then change APP levels; the
other is that rs2833249 affects the expression levels of the nearby
genes including GRIK1 and APP independently.

4.2.3 Path: rs4833235 (TRPC3) —> ZNF720 (APP) —> AD

TRPC3 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C,
member 3) is a gene located 90369bp upstream of rs4833235. It has
been reported that TRPC3 protects neurons by deregulating tau pro—
tein (Yamamoto et al., 2007), another major factor associated with
AD. We also found that misfolded beta—amyloid induces misfolded
tau protein (Nussbaum et al., 2013). Based on these, we consider
two hypotheses. First, rs4833235 changes TRPC3 levels, and the
perturbed TRPC3 levels affect beta—amyloid levels, which in turn af—
fect tau protein levels. Second, rs4833235 affects TRPC3, which
then affects both APP and tau protein independently, leading to the
change of AD risk.

4.2.4 Path: rs722861 (EFCAB6) —> ZNF720 (APP) —> AD
EFCAB6 (EF—hand calcium binding domain 6) is located 121762bp
upstream of rs722861, and it interacts with androgen receptor and
PARK7 (Parkinson protein 7) (Niki et al., 2003; Szklarczyk et al.,
2011), a gene related to Parkinson’s disease. It has been shown that
reduced androgen levels increase the levels of beta—amyloid and
hyperphosphorylated tau protein (Drummond et al., 2009).
Therefore, we hypothesize that EFCAB6 regulates beta—amyloid lev—
els through androgen receptors, and EFCAB6 may be involved in
multiple neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and AD.

4.3 Estrogen—related path associations

We identified six path associations that involve RHOBTB3 (rho—
related BTB domain containing 3), which is a putative anti—estrogen
resistance gene for breast cancer patients (Van Agthoven et al.,
2009). In the early stage of breast cancer, the growth of tumors re—
quires estrogens, which can be inhibited by anti—estrogens.
However, as the tumor progresses, it becomes anti—estrogens resist—
ant, and genes involved in such a process are called anti—estrogen re—
sistance genes. In our literature survey, we also found that estrogen
protects neurons against beta—amyloid (Yao et al., 2007), and estro—
gen has been extensively studied for AD therapy (Henderson, 2014;
Kawas et al., 1997;). Combining these, we suggest that RHOBTB3
is related to AD though an estrogen receptor. As examples, we inves—
tigate possible association mechanisms for the following two paths.

4.3.1 Path: r52974135 (CTNNA2) —> RHOBTB3 —> AD

In this path, r52974135 is located within a gene encoding CTNNA2
(catenin, alpha 2), which is neuronal—specific catenin. CTNNA2 is
reportedly associated with late—onset AD in the Amish populations
(Cummings et al., 2012). We also found a small p—value in our data
for the SNP—phenotype association (p—value : 0.033). Previous stud—
ies and our results support that associations exist between CTNNA2
and the AD status, and between RHOBTB3 and the AD status.
It would be interesting to conduct biological experiments to investi—
gate if CTNNA2 interacts with RHOBTB3 to confirm this path
association.

4.3.2 Path: r511057512 (CCDC62) —> RHOBTB3 —> AD

The SNP rs11057512 is located 4732 bp upstream of CCDC62
(coiled—coil domain containing 62), a nuclear receptor co—activator
that can enhance transactivation of ESR1 (estrogen receptor 1) and
ESR2 (estrogen receptor 2) (Chen et al., 2009). It seems that
CCDC62 is associated with RHOBTB3 through estrogen pathways.
Furthermore, it has been reported that CCDC62 is associated with
Parkinson’s disease risk in a Han Chinese population (Liu et al.,
2013). It would be interesting to exam CCDC62’s pleiotropic effects
on neurological disorders including Parkinson’s disease and AD.

4.4 Nicotine—related path associations

We also found seven path associations that involve vesicle—associ—
ated membrane protein 1 (VAMP1). VAMP1 is a gene encoding
SNARE complex that controls neurotransmitter release via vesicle—
mediated synaptic transmission (Fernandez-Castillo et al., 2012);
further, it is involved in nicotine pathway through SNARE complex.
Interestingly, nicotine’s involvement in AD has been extensively
studied, and nicotinic receptors have been suggested as drug targets
for AD (Maelicke et al., 2001; Newhouse et al., 1997).
Furthermore, Zou et al. (2010) reported that eSNPs within VAMP1
are associated with late—onset AD. Below, we explore two path asso—
ciations with VAMP1.

4.4.1 Path: r510514262 (HAPLN1) —> VAMP1 —> AD

The SNP rs10514262 is located 93 475 bp downstream of
hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1 (HAPLN1). It has been
reported that HAPLN1 is one of the major components forming a
‘perineuronal net’ that protects AD cortical and subcortical neurons
against iron—induced oxidative stress (Suttkus et al., 2014). This has
been experimentally validated via knockout experiments, where
mice lacking HAPLN1 failed to develop a normally shaped peri—
neuronal net. This suggests that HAPLN1 is potentially associated
with AD. To confirm this path association, it would be interesting
to examine the status of VAMP1 when HAPLN1 is knocked out,
and the effects of VAMP1 levels on the formation of perineuronal
net.

4.4.2 Path: rs4656888 (CD1E) —> VAMP1 —> AD

The SNP rs4656888 is located 68804bp downstream of CD1E
(cluster of differentiation 1E), a member of the CD1 family. CD1
is structurally related to major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
proteins (Wilson and Bjorkman, 1998); further, the relationships
between MHC proteins and nicotinic attenuation of central ner—
vous system has been reported (Shi et al., 2009). Therefore, it
seems that CD1E is associated with VAMP1 through its involve—
ments in the nicotine pathway; for future work, it would be inter—
esting to study the interactions between CD1E and VAMP1 in the
nicotine pathway.

5 Conclusions

We proposed a new paradigm of path associations to detect associ—
ations among genotypes, gene expression traits, and phenotypes.
Furthermore, we developed a network—driven method, NETAM,
using state—of—the—art machine learning techniques. Specifically, we
employed SRMs to find edges in an association network considering
all SNPs or all expression traits simultaneously, and stability selec—
tion and screening for false positive control and large—scale analysis.
In the analysis of the late—onset AD data, NETAM found 477 signifi—
cant path associations, among which, we investigated the paths that
include ZNF720, RHOBTB3, and VAMP1 genes. These findings
suggest various association mechanisms through beta—amyloid, es—
trogen, and nicotine pathways, which seemed to be crucially related
to AD.

One promising future research direction would be to extend as—
sociation networks to capture complex association mechanisms by
introducing additional edges between different SNPs, between dif—
ferent gene traits or between different phenotypes. Further, when
adding edges in the networks, we can take advantage of the struc—
tures in the genome (e.g. linkage disequilibrium) or gene—gene inter—
action networks. It would also be interesting to develop a theory to
estimate false discovery rate for path associations in NETAM, and
to conduct biological experiments to validate our proposed hypothe—
ses for AD—related path associations.

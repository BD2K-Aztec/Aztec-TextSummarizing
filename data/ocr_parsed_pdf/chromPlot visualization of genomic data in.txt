Abstract

Summary: Visualizing genomic data in chromosomal context can help detecting errors in data pro—
cessing and may suggest new hypotheses to be tested. Here, we report a new tool for displaying
large and diverse genomic data along chromosomes. The software is implemented in R so that
visualization can be easily integrated with its numerous packages for processing genomic data. It
supports simultaneous visualization of multiple tracks of data. Large genomic regions such as
OTLs or synteny tracts may be shown along histograms of number of genes, genetic variants, or
any other type of genomic element. Tracks can also contain values for continuous or categorical
variables and the user can choose among points, connected lines, colored segments, or histo—
grams for representing data. chromPlot takes data from tables in data.frame in GRanges formats.
The information necessary to draw chromosomes for mouse and human is included with the pack—
age. For other organisms, chromPlot can read Gap and cytoBandldeo tables from the UCSC
Genome Browser. We present common use cases here, and a full tutorial is included as the pack—
age’s vignette.

Availability and Implementation: chromPlot is distributed under a GLP2 licence at http://www.bio
conductor.org.

1 Introduction

When analyzing large amounts of genomic data, visualization in
chromosomal context can reveal chromosome-specific or genome-
wide patterns suggesting new hypotheses and their appropriate tests.
In addition, it may show errors in data generation or in an analysis
step. We distinguish between two types of genomic visualization:
local and global. Local visualization displays data in a region within
one chromosome. Global visualization displays data in whole
chromosomes. Tools available for local visualization are very flex-
ible, allowing highly customized plots with diverse data, e.g.
GenomeGraphs (Durinck et (11., 2009) and GenoPlotR (Guy et (11.,
2010) R packages and the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)
(Thorvaldsdéttir et (11., 2013).

Global Visualization has been incorporated in websites of cross-spe-
cies repositories, e.g. UCSC, Ensembl and NCBI, and in species-specific
websites, such as or the Chromosome Visualization Tool (Cvit)

(Cannon et (11., 2011) and Gviewer lgmod.org/wiki/FlashiGViewer).
Standalone tools are task-sepecific, e.g. PhenoGram (Wolfe et (11., 2013)
represents genotype-by-phenotype associations. Quantsmooth displays
discrete and continuous data in the local view, and large segments in the
global view. The IdeoViz R-package can plot continuous values as lines
or bars for binned data (Pai and Ren, 2014) but has no support for cat-
egorical data. Thus, there is a need for a generic tool for global visual-
ization to mach flexibility of local visualizers of genomic data.

2 Software

The chromPlot package was developed in R and uses builtin functions
for data processing and plotting using points, lines, bars or colored seg-
ments. It automatically finds clusters of overlapping segments and
stacks then] for saving plotting space. When segments are too numer-
ous, e.g. all genonie’s genes, it uses histograms.

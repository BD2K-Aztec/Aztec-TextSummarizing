Abstract

Summary: Analysis ofthe composition of heterogeneous tissue has been greatly enabled by recent
developments in single—cell transcriptomics. We present SCell, an integrated software tool for qual—
ity filtering, normalization, feature selection, iterative dimensionality reduction, clustering and the
estimation of gene—expression gradients from large ensembles of single—cell RNA—seq datasets.
SCell is open source, and implemented with an intuitive graphical interface. Scripts and protocols
for the high—throughput pre—processing of large ensembles of single—cell, RNA—seq datasets are

provided as an additional resource.

Availability and Implementation: Binary executables for Windows, MacOS and Linux are available
at http://sourceforge.net/projects/scell, source code and pre—processing scripts are available from

https://github.com/diazlab/SCel |.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

1 Introduction

Single-cell sequencing enables heterogeneity assessments at unprece-
dented resolution. At a cost comparable to sequencing a sample in
bulk, hundreds of single-cell datasets can instead be generated. We
present SCell, a software tool to perform outlier filtering, to normal-
ize cell-cycle effects, to select genes for dimensionality reduction and
to estimate inter-sample expression gradients. Several groups have
proposed reconstructing the gene-expression kinetics of develop-
mental processes from transcriptomics data, by summarizing gene
expression along the backbone of a spanning graph of the samples’
PCA coordinates (Bendall et (11., 2014; Magwene et al, 2003;
Trapnell et a], 2014). As single-cell sequencing becomes more widely
adopted, the large number of available samples makes direct regres-
sion of gene expression on PCA coordinates an attractive alterna-
tive. SCell can regress/interpolate gene expression on PCA space,
visualize expression gradients, and estimate expression kinetics
along minimum spanning trees and minimum weight paths. These
tools are accessible through an interactive, graphical interface.

2 Results

2.1 Quality control and pre—processing

To identify outlier libraries, we developed a strategy to estimate genes
expressed at background levels in a given sample. We then filter sam-
ples whose background fraction is significantly larger than average.
Our approach builds on previous methods for sequencing data based
on order-statistics (Diaz et (11., 2012; Xu et (11., 2010) (Supplementary
Materials M1, Supplementary Figure S1A). In our tests, samples that
had a small q-value for our Lorenz-statistic had low complexity, as
measured by Gini-Simpson index, and/or they had low coverage, as
estimated by the Good-Turing statistic (Supplementary Figure S1B).
Moreover, in our data the Lorenz-statistic correlated with the results
of live-dead staining (Pearson-correlation 0.74). SCell displays these
quality metrics, Gini-Simpson index and user’s metadata, including
the number of mapped reads and the results of live-dead staining, in
an interactive expression profiler (Supplementary Figure S1C). SCell
also reports library coverage and marginal-return estimates based on
PRESEQ (Daley and Smith, 2014) (Supplementary Materials M1).

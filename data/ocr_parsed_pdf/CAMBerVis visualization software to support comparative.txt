ABSTRACT

Motivation: A number of inconsistencies in genome annotations are
documented among bacterial strains. Visualization of the differences
may help biologists to make correct decisions in spurious cases.
Results: We have developed a visualization tool, CAMBerVis, to
support comparative analysis of multiple bacterial strains. The
software manages simultaneous visualization of multiple bacterial
genomes, enabling visual analysis focused on genome structure
annotations.

Availability: The CAMBerVis software is freely available at
the project website: http://bioputer.mimuw.edu.pl/camber. Input
datasets for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Staphylocacus aureus
are integrated with the software as examples.

Contact: m.wozniak@mimuw.edu.pl

Supplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

The large amount of genomic data that is being generated enables
exciting new ways for comparative analysis of genomes. In
particular, revealing drug resistance mechanisms in pathogenic
bacteria is currently one of the important applications of comparative
genomics. Systematic comparison of drug resistant and drug
susceptible strains can bring us new Clues on how drug resistance
emerges. However, since the presence of a single gene or mutation
can lead to drug resistance, we may require very precise genome
structure annotations to carry out reasonable drug resistance studies.

A recent comparative study (Wozniak et al., 2011) considered
three pathogenic bacteria: Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
Staphylocacus aureus and Escherichia coli. The results showed
many inconsistencies in genome structure annotations. Moreover,
lots of the inconsistencies are not due to real sequence differences,
but are apparently caused by the use of different gene annotation
methodologies by different laboratories.

The problem of inconsistencies in genome annotations of
translation initiation start sites (TISs) was also reported by another
recent study (Dunbar et al., 2011). The authors compared gene starts
annotations of orthologous gene families among ﬁve bacterial strains
of Burkholderia. The analysis showed that 53% of the ortholog
gene families have inconsistent gene starts annotations in GenBank.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Furthermore, inconsistencies for only 17% of all the ortholog gene
families could be explained by sequence divergences.

Therefore, manual curation by biologists is necessary in cases
where standard genome annotation tools produce inconsistencies. In
order to better support this type of analysis, we have implemented
CAMBerVis—a software that allows for visual comparison of the
genome structure annotations of multiple bacterial strains.

2 METHODS

2.1 Basic concepts

CAMBerVis is a software designed to Visualize genome structure annotations
(both original and predicted) according to the concepts introduced in our
previous work (Wozniak et al.. 2011) (called the CAMBer approach). Here
we brieﬂy introduce the basic required notations.

CAMBer is an approach to support comparative analysis of multiple
bacterial strains. As input it uses genome sequences and original annotations
of the bacterial strains considered. Then. it iteratively transfers gene
annotations. until the transitive closure (of the proposed homology relation)
is computed. Thus. during the procedure. new open reading frames (ORFs)
become annotated. We call the ﬁnal resulting structure annotations the
predicted annotations. Furthermore. in order to manage the problem of
inconsistencies in TIS annotations. CAMBer introduces the concept of a
multigene. which represents a set of gene annotations with the same stop
codon. Then. multigenes (nodes) are linked by homology relationships
(edges) between their elements. We call the structure a consolidation graph.
Multigenes in the same connected component of the consolidation graph are
proposed to be gene families.

2.2 CAMBerVis

The input to CAMBerVis consists of genome FASTA ﬁles and a ﬁle with
predicted genome structure annotation. The ﬁle format is generic and not
dependent on CAMBer. A user may ﬁnd more details of the format in
the software documentation and learn from the integrated examples on
M.tuberculosis and S.aureus.

Here we describe the main features of CAMBerVis based on a typical
usage. In the ﬁrst step. we identify a gene family of interest with some
annotation inconsistencies. CAMBerVis manages statistics for every gene
family in a table in the ComponentsStats window. Using this table. we can
easily ﬁnd gene families with missing gene annotations or inconsistencies
among annotated TISs.

Second. the Visualization is automatically focused on the selected gene
family showing simultaneously its multigenes (with both annotated and
predicted TISs) in all strains. We may also see their neighborhood in different
scales using intuitive genome navigation.

Third. we use on-the-ﬂy comparative analysis supported by CAMBerVis.
For example in the case of inconsistently annotated TISs. we may compare
promoter regions by multiple alignments using the integrated CLUSTALW.

Fig. 1. The main View of the CAMBerVis interface with loaded example data for 22 strains of S. aureus. The View is focused on a highly conserved connected
component (gene family) with ﬁve different TISs in each multigene, selected from the list in the ComponentsStats window. Multigenes are Visualized as
horizontal rectangles, with TISs presented as vertical ticks (originally annotated TISs are red and long). The window TasksTable keeps track of results obtained

on-the-ﬂy by ClustalW or NCBI BLAST API.

CAMBerVis also enables external queries Via NCBI BLAST API, which
can be applied to check which TIS is the most often annotated in external
databases like, for example, NCBI non-redundant (NR) database.

Figure 1 presents a screen shot of the running application. The
Visualization is focused on a gene family identiﬁed by ComponentsStats
table sorted by the number of TISs. There are ﬁve different TISs annotated
in GenBank among the 22 fully sequenced strains of S.aureus, annotated
with the following frequencies: 2,1,7,4,8 (ordered from the TIS giving rise
to the shortest gene to the TIS giving rise to the longest gene). An analysis
of the multiple alignment computed by CLUSTALW showed that the gene
family is highly conserved among strains and only four of the strains have
SNP in the 100 bp long promotor region. Queries to the NCBI NR database
showed that the TIS that yields the longest gene is the most often annotated.

CAMBerVis is a stand-alone application written in Java, which makes it
a cross-platform application, tested on Windows, Mac and Linux. Notably,
it is implemented based on the Netbeans [DE platform, which makes the
application ﬂexible and easy to extend. Another beneﬁt is that the windows
manager allows user to customize the window localization.

3 CONCLUSON

The amount of data that is being generated stimulates active
development of Visualization techniques and softwares, which are
invaluable to scientist for manual curation of results (Nielsen et al.,
2010). The most notable are VISTA (Frazer et al., 2004), Microbial
Genomes (Dehal et al., 2010), Integrated Microbial Genomes
(Markowitz et al., 2008), SEED Viewer (Overbeek et al., 2005),
K-BROWSER (Chakrabarti et al., 2004) and Artemis (Rutherford
et al., 2000). However, only VISTA and K-BROWSER allow
multiple genome Visualization.

Here we present CAMBerVis, a new genome browser which
allows simultaneous Visualization and comparative analysis of
multiple bacterial strains. Moreover, it is the ﬁrst Visualization

software distinguishing original and predicted genome structure
annotations. Another advantage of CAMBerVis over existing
softwares is its intuitive management of plasmids, which are
common in bacteria.

CAMBerVis is an open-source application freely available at
the project website and integrated with two example datasets for
M. tuberculosis and S. aureus.

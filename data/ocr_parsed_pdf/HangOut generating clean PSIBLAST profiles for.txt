ABSTRACT

Summary: Profile-based similarity search is an essential step in
structure-function studies of proteins. However, inclusion of non-
homologous sequence segments into a profile causes its corruption
and results in false positives. Profile corruption is common in
multidomain proteins, and single domains with long insertions are a
significant source of errors. We developed a procedure (HangOut)
that, for a single domain with specified insertion position, cleans
erroneously extended PSI-BLAST alignments to generate better
profiles.

Availability: HangOut is implemented in Python 2.3 and runs on all
Unix-compatible platforms. The source code is available under the

1 INTRODUCTION

PSI-BLAST (Altschul et (11., 1997) is an indispensable tool
for remote homology inference and structure-function predictions
(Devos and Valencia, 2000; Friedberg, 2006; Grishin, 2001; Hegyi
and Gerstein, 2001). However, false positives in PSI-BLAST can
cause errors in automated annotations (Bork and Koonin, 1998). One
major source for such false positives is proﬁle corruption, usually
resulting from extension of alignments over non-homologous
sequence regions (Galperin and Koonin, 1998). For instance, for two
2-domain proteins, AB and A’ C, PSI-BLAST may extend a correct
alignment of the homologous domains A and A’ to include sequences
from the non-homologous domains B and C. Despite signiﬁcant
effort devoted to this multidomain problem, no satisfactory solution
exists (Gonzalez and Pearson, 2010; Galzitskaya and Melnik, 2003;
George and Heringa, 2002; Nagarajan and Yona, 2004). Currently,
the best approach is to start PSI-BLAST with precisely deﬁned query
sequence bounds (Corpet et (11., 2000; Wheeler et (11., 2001).
However, we found that even a single, well-deﬁned domain
does not guarantee a corruption-free proﬁle. Domains hosting
insertions, which represent Close to 5% of domains in the structural
Classiﬁcation of proteins (SCOP) 1.75 database (Murzin et (11.,
1995), may generate a corrupted PSI-BLAST proﬁle due to incorrect
alignment extension around the insertion position. Our analysis
shows that the N- and C-terminal segments of the host domain

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

are frequently aligned as separate PSI-BLAST high scoring pairs
(HSPs), and the two HSPs overlap when mapped onto the query
sequence. Each alignment can be divided into two segments: (i)
correctly aligned and (ii) incorrectly aligned or extended (Fig. 1a
and Supplementary Fig. 51). These incorrectly aligned ‘overhangs’
are detected and removed by the HangOut program to Clean the
proﬁle and prepare it for consequent remote homology searches with
various tools, such as PSI-BLAST and HHsearch.

2 METHODS

The HangOut input is a single domain query sequence with the insertion
boundary speciﬁed. The HangOut algorithm proceeds as follows (Fig. 1a):
(1) Run BLAST with the input sequence against the NCBI non-redundant
database with e-Value threshold 0.001. (2) Detect and remove lower-
scoring (see second half of this paragraph for clariﬁcation) regions from
HSPs and regions matching a PSI-BLAST proﬁle of the inserted domain
(see Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 for rationale). (3) Terminate upon
convergence or iteration limit. Otherwise, repeat Steps 1 to 3 with the
following modiﬁcations: (i) PSI-BLAST replaces BLAST, seeded (-B option)
with the cleaned proﬁle from Step 2 and (ii) proﬁle scores (PSSM) replace
BLOSUM62 scores (for HSP removal). Thus, HangOut builds multiple
sequence alignments similarly to PSI-BLAST, but has a ‘clean-up’ step
after each iteration intended to remove incorrect extensions. HangOut is
based on two assumptions: (i) each HSP contains at least one correctly
aligned region, and (ii) incorrectly extended regions exist in every HSP
that crosses the insertion point. Based on these assumptions, HangOut splits
all local alignments into two segments with a boundary at the insertion
point and selects the best scoring (BLOSUM62 or PSSM) segment out
of each split pair. The lower scoring segment is removed as a possibly
erroneous extension. In addition to this HangOut procedure, we applied
RemoveHit, a simpler method that does not require a deﬁned insertion
point and removes entire alignments for hits with two overlapping HSPs
(Supplementary Fig. S4).

HangOut was tested on a set of 40% representative SCOP 1.75 domains
deﬁned to contain insertions (302 domains, see Supplementary Table 1
for the list) to measure the number of corrupted proﬁles (false positives)
and the number of correct homologs found by each discontinuous query
domain sequence (with insertion sequence removed). The 302 hidden
Markov Models (HHMS) built from each PSI-BLAST proﬁles, HangOut
proﬁles or RemoveHit proﬁles were compared to HHMs built from all
9528 SCOP 1.75 40% representative domains (Murzin at (11., 1995) using
HHsearch ver. 1.5.1 (Soding, 2005). The number of corrupted proﬁles was
increased by one if HHsearch found homologs of inserted domains with
probability higher than 0.9. The number of homologs found are counted by
the number of hits that have strong proﬁle similarity (HHsearch probability
above 0.9) and overall structural similarity (DaliLite Z-score higher than 4)
(Holm and Park, 2000) or belonged to the same SCOP superfarnilies as the
query domains.

ﬂowchart. Starting from a query domain (blueired, with inserted domain
in yellow removed), a PSI-BLAST search of the NCBI non-redundant
database (NR) is performed (Step 1) to produce alignments. Erroneously
extended regions (yellow) that cross the insertion boundary (vertical dotted
line) are removed to produce a ‘cleaned’ alignment (Step 271). Remaining
contaminants not crossing the domain boundary are removed by PSI-BLAST
proﬁles built from the long insertion (Step 272). The PSI-BLAST result
is checked for convergence (Step 3), and possibly continued from Step 1.
(b) Structure of two middle domains of the TrmE GTP-binding protein

dlxzpal, chain A: 1187211, 372450) is inserted into an ot-helical bundle
(N- and C-terminal segments are colored blue and red, respectively; SCOP
ID d1xzpa2, chain A: 212371). (c and d) HangOut performance test
showing the number of corrupted proﬁles and the number of found homologs,
respectively. Performances, of PSI-BLAST and RemoveHit, are also shown.
RemoveHit removes all alignments for hits with two overlapping HSPs as in
Supplementary Figure Slb. The HangOut proﬁles show high accuracy with
only one case of possible corruption (c) and without losing sensitivity (d).

3 RESULTS

HangOut is intended to Clean PSI-BLAST generated proﬁles of
erroneous extensions caused by domain insertions. One typical
example of this domain problem is shown in Figure lb: an ai/ﬂ P-loop
hydrolase (yellow in Fig. lb) is inserted into an ai-helical bundle
(blue and red in Fig. 1b). Corruption of the PSI-BLAST alignment
built from hits to the ai-helical bundle is evidenced by a proﬁle-
based similarity search (HHsearch), which ﬁnds the 01/5 P-loop
hydrolase domain with probability 98%. Since the query ai-helical
bundle does not share any sequence or structural similarities with
the hydrolase domain, the high HHsearch probability results from
proﬁle corruption (for details see Supplementary Fig. S2).

Given the success of this example, we tested the ability of
HangOut to Clean proﬁles of all SCOP domains with deﬁned
insertions (302 domains). As a basis for comparison, 91 PSI-BLAST
proﬁles (30%) were corrupted. RemoveHit Cleans only 23 of these
proﬁles, while HangOut Cleans all but one (Fig. 10). The single
exception is probably due to distant homology, since both the host
and inserted domain represent similar doubly wound Rossmann

folds (Supplementary Fig. S5). Because the removal of sequence
segments from alignments may deprive the proﬁle, we also Checked
for the loss of true hits. Surprisingly, Cleaned HangOut proﬁles
retained ~98% of the homologs found by PSI-BLAST proﬁles
(99.6% for RemoveHit), suggesting that useﬁil information is not
lost from the proﬁles. Compared to RemoveHit, the complexities
of HangOut that use domain boundary information are apparently
needed to Clean corrupted proﬁles. The presence of overlapping
HSPs (removed by RemoveHit) does not sufﬁciently indicate
corrupted segments. For remote homologs, only a single HSP
may be found and incorrectly extended to cover part of the
insertion. Although our current HangOut procedure does not offer
a comprehensive solution to the multidomain problem, it addresses
a special case of domains with insertions that represent the major
source of proﬁle corruption when PSI-BLAST is initiated with
single, discontinuous domain queries. HangOut will be especially
useﬁil for large-scale bioinformatics efforts that are initiated from
deﬁned structure domains and require uncorrupt sequence proﬁles
for subsequent analysis. Additional work will be done to offer a
general solution without prior knowledge of domain boundaries.

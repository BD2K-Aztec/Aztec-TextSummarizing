ABSTRACT

Motivation: Targeted ‘deep’ sequencing of specific genes or regions
is of great interest in clinical cancer diagnostics where some
sequence variants, particularly translocations and indels, have known
prognostic or diagnostic significance. In this setting, it is unnecessary
to sequence an entire genome, and target capture methods can be
applied to limit sequencing to important regions, thereby reducing
costs and the time required to complete testing. Existing ‘next-
gen’ sequencing analysis packages are optimized for efficiency in
whole-genome studies and are unable to benefit from the particular
structure of targeted sequence data.

Results: We developed SLOPE to detect structural variants from
targeted short-DNA reads. We use both real and simulated data
to demonstrate SLOPE’s ability to rapidly detect insertion/deletion
events of various sizes as well as translocations and viral integration
sites with high sensitivity and low false discovery rate.

1 INTRODUCTION

Next-gen sequencing technologies provide an enormous amount
of genome data at a cost many orders of magnitude lower than
conventional capillary-based sequencing methods. While the use
of next-generation sequencing has, to date, been largely conﬁned
to complex whole-genome analysis projects (Mardis et (11., 2009;
Stephens et (11., 2009), the technology can similarly be applied
to targeted ‘deep’ sequencing of particular genes or regions of
interest. Using this hypothesis-driven approach, selected genes can
be analyzed for rare sequence variants, indels and translocations
easily and at low cost. This approach is particularly useful in
the Clinical laboratory where genes/regions of known prognostic
signiﬁcance can be analyzed simultaneously for structural variation.
Furthermore, next-generation technologies have the capacity to
sequence multiple samples at once through the use of ‘barcodes’
or indexed labels, further driving down the cost of individual
experiments (Mardis, 2008).

Next-generation sequence data can be generated from whole
genomes, generally with coverage of 20- to 30-fold, or from
‘targeted’ regions of interest with much higher fold coverage. Target
enrichment methods include standard PCR, ligation-mediated PCR
or hybrid capture (Mamanova et (11., 2010). Unlike PCR-based
approaches, hybrid capture enrichment is an ampliﬁcation-free
method that uses labeled, complementary DNA ‘probes’ to hybridize
to regions of interest in genomic DNA. (Fig. l). The hybridized,
captured DNA sequences are then physically immobilized, while
non-complementary sequences are washed away, and the captured
DNA is eluted and sequenced. A major beneﬁt of hybrid capture
over PCR is that non-complementary sequences adjacent to regions
of complementarity are also captured, permitting the identiﬁcation
of viral integration sites (as in this case) or translocation breakpoints.

Several programs, including BreakDancer, Pindel,
VariationHunter, MoDIL and PEMer (Chen et (11., 2009;
Hormozdiari et (11., 2010; Korbel et (11., 2009; Lee et (11.,

whole genomes exist. However, none of these software packages is

SLOPE

 

ideally suited for the analysis of targeted sequence data, especially
in the Clinical laboratory setting. Pindel, for example, detects certain
indels with single-base resolution but is not designed to detect
translocations. The remaining programs above rely on discordant
mapping of paired-end reads to detect structural variants. Both
members of each pair are aligned to the full reference genome; an
unexpectedly large or small separation between the two members
of a pair suggests an insertion or deletion, respectively, while a pair
that gets mapped in the wrong orientation or onto two different
Chromosomes may indicate an inversion or translocation. These
discordant pair methods cannot, in general, achieve single-base
resolution, which may be Clinically relevant, and may result in
relatively high false positive discovery rates (Mardis et (11., 2009).
Because they do not take advantage of the known target sequence
enrichment, they also require a time-consuming preprocessing step,
alignment of the sequence data to the entire human genome. We
developed SLOPE to overcome many of these problems including
speed and false positive discovery rate. By focusing on a small
(a few kb to a few Mb) target reference sequence, SLOPE can
perform fast and ﬂexible split-read alignments and determine
‘Chimeric’ sequences with single-base resolution.

SLOPE aims to detect sequence breakpoints from only one side
of a split read, and therefore does not rely on the insert size for
detection. In contrast with, for example, Pindel, which permits no
mismatches with respect to the reference genome, SLOPE allows
for multiple mismatches and gapped alignments between the query
and reference genomes. Together, these account for the two major
advantages of SLOPE: its speed and its tolerance to structural
variation. Both of these are critical to its application in a Clinical
setting as Clinical tests require timely results. Furthermore, DNA
translocations, viral insertions, etc., may occur in regions of genomic
instability, particularly in cancer genomes (Mitelman et (11., 2007).
SLOPE attains much of its speed by aligning to only the short target
sequence of interest, which requires many orders of magnitude less
computation than aligning to the entire genome. While this approach
limits SLOPE to the detection of sequence variation in the regions
of interest, translocations or viral integration sites that involve these
regions can be located in non-targeted areas by alignment of output
sequences to the entire genome. SLOPE achieves its ﬂexibility
by placing little restriction on the allowable gaps and SNPs. The
alignment of short, imperfect partial alignments to the reference
genome will necessarily have a low speciﬁcity, however. SLOPE
minimizes noise and detects the most likely Chimeric sequences
using a weighted least squares regression approach.

We demonstrate the utility of SLOPE by locating Merkel cell
polyomavirus (MCPyV) integration sites in the human genome.
Brieﬂy, Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare cutaneous tumor
that has recently been noted to, in most cases, harbor a novel,
Clonally integrated polyomavirus, MCPyV (Duncavage et (11., 2009;
Feng et (11., 2008). As MCC is a rare tumor, the Characterization
of integration sites has been difﬁcult due the paucity of frozen
tissue and high-quality DNA needed for traditional methods such
as RACE, ligation-mediated PCR or inverse PCR. Using hybrid-
selection and next-generation paired-end sequencing, we identify
MCPyV viral integration sites from low DNA quality, archival,
formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens using
SLOPE. We also test the SLOPE program on simulated data
and compare its performance with that of the analysis packages
BreakDancer and Pindel (Ye et (11., 2009).

2 METHODS

SLOPE is implemented in CTT and accepts as input either preprocessed
paired-end data or unprocessed FASTQ single-end reads. In the case
of paired-end data, improved computational efﬁciency is attained by
preprocessing: the FASTQ sequence ﬁles should be ﬁrst aligned to the short
targeted reference genome using alignment software, such as MAQ (Li et (11.,
2008), and converted to either the Maq mapview (Li et (11., 2008) or standard
SAM format (Li et (11., 2009). This step reduces the computational burden,
as SLOPE then processes only ‘orphaned sequences’, unmapped sequences
whose mates did map to the target reference genome; however, SLOPE
remains agnostic as to the orientation and position of the mapped partner
in order to allow for unknown structural variation. In the case of single-end
reads, no preprocessing is necessary, and SLOPE processes all sequences.
SLOPE attempts partial alignments between either the 5’ or 3’ end of each
unmapped read and the target reference genome: it determines the highest
scoring quality-weighted ungapped alignments between either end of the
sequence and the target genome, allowing up to ﬁve mismatches. Ties in
high-scoring alignments are broken at random. In order to reduce noise due to
spurious short partial alignments, alignments comprising less than 25730%,
depending on read length, of the total read length are disregarded. To improve
computational efﬁciency, partial alignments representing more than 8&90%
of the total read length, which are relatively uninformative about the putative
variant, are also discarded. These cutoffs serve only to improve algorithm
performance, and do not qualitatively affect the results. The remaining
partial alignments are then clustered according to orientation and position
on the reference genome to determine the set of potential breakpoints. For
each unique read, the initial partial ungapped alignment is reﬁned by the
Smith7Waterman algorithm (Smith and Waterman, 1981) to allow for gaps.
The Smith7Waterman reﬁnements are restricted to a neighborhood (within
10 bp to either side of the initial, crude alignment) in order to reduce the
computational burden. The unique reads in each cluster are then sorted in
order of mapped position.

Within each sequence cluster, let x, be the 5’ position of the i-th
unique sequence. Let S, be set of putative breakpoints, consisting of both
indels and terminal ends of partial alignments, identiﬁed by the Smith7
Waterman algorithm; let z, be the median of Si. Finally, let yizzi—xi,
the ‘length’ of the i-th partial alignment. For a true chimeric junction,
in the absence of noise, the 5’ positions and partial alignment lengths
would correlate exactly. Furthermore, the line y 2 ﬁx +130 would have slope
1312—1 (Fig. 2A). However, non-speciﬁc alignments of short, imperfect
partial reads, sequencing error, PCR replication error and variance in the
best-ﬁtting ‘breakpoints’ identiﬁed by the Smith7Waterman algorithm will
affect the estimated slope. A weighted least-squares regression, with weights
given by the Smith7Waterman alignment scores, is used to assign greater
importance to longer, higher quality partial alignments. For each cluster
representing a potential chimeric read, the slope E1 is determined and
99% bootstrapped conﬁdence interval for 131 estimated (Efron, 1979). This
resampling approach is robust to error introduced in the PCR and sequencing
step as well as to spurious short, partial alignments and provides that clusters
representing indels or translocations should contain — 1. Our results were also
robust to the choice of weight function. For example, the weight function
w,»=l/(l+maxS,»—minS,»), an estimate of the precision of the putative
breakpoint, provided qualitatively similar results. SLOPE outputs all clusters
whose conﬁdence intervals contain —1, within a user-speciﬁed tolerance.
Other clusters likely result from non-speciﬁc alignments of short sequence
fragments.

(C) Results were then veriﬁed by designing PCR primers to the proposed

and sequencing by gel capillary electrophoresis. PCR (left) and subsequent
sequencing results (right) are shown.

for MCPyV-containing sequences, the extracted genomic DNA was
end repaired and ligated to standard Illumina sequencing primers.
One microgram of material was denatured with 100 ng of biotin-
labeled MCPyV capture probes spanning the 5.3 kb viral genome and
subjected to hybrid capture. Post-hybridization, sequence-enriched
DNA was eluted from the capture probes and PCR ampliﬁed
before paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina GAII
using default parameters. PCR products were analyzed by gel
electrophoresis to ensure no distinct bands representing biased
ampliﬁcation were present (data not shown). Four samples, three
with 75 bp read lengths and one with 50 bp reads, were enriched and
sequenced in duplicate by the above methodology.

The paired-end reads were ﬁrst aligned to the reference MCPyV
genome using Maq (version 0.7.1) under the default parameters (Li
et (11., 2008). Then the SLOPE program was used to identify Chimeric
reads. Finally, BLAST (Altschul et (11., 1990) was used to align
the unmapped ends of the consensus Chimeric reads to locate the
insertion sites in the human genome.

For each of the three samples consisting of 75 bp paired-end
reads, SLOPE successﬁilly located both of the viral/human junctions

breakpoints with single-base resolution. These breakpoints were
also identiﬁed using the BreakDancer program (Chen et (11., 2009),
and conﬁrmed by PCR across the junction, followed by Sanger
sequencing (Fig. 2). In the one sample of 50 bp paired-end reads,
SLOPE found only one human/virus junction, which was then
conﬁrmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing. BreakDancer was unable
to locate any Chimeric reads from this sample. SLOPE located the
Chimeric reads from each sample in ~10 min, as compared with
BreakDancer which required several days.

3.2 Simulated data

Data were simulated by ﬁrst linearizing the Circular MCPyV
genome (GI 165973999) and inserting it into a contiguous le
region of the human X Chromosome (build 37 ref). Both the viral
linearization breakpoint and the insertion site were varied across
simulations. Insertions and deletions of lengths 1—1000bp were
randomly inserted. Maq (version 0.7.1) (Li et (11., 2008) was used
to simulate paired-end 75 bp reads from this aggregate genome with
750-fold coverage (parameters: -N10 000 000 -r0.001 -R0). Quality
scores were simulated according to the distribution of qualities from
the real MCPyV data above, and a mutation rate of 0.001 was
assumed.

The simulated viral insertion sites were located using SLOPE,
just as for the real data. The sites were found using BreakDancer
by ﬁrst using Maq to align the short reads to a FASTA reference
ﬁle consisting of the viral genome and the X Chromosome. Then
BreakDancerMax (version 0.0.1-r89, using parameter -e) was run to
locate the ‘translocation’ between Chromosome X and the MCPyV
genome.

Both SLOPE and BreakDancer successfully located the viral
insertion site in ﬁve of ﬁve cases. In the case of SLOPE, locating
the viral insertion sites on a Macintosh Pro with dual 2.26 GHz Intel
Xeon 5500 quad core processors and 16GB of RAM required 760
s to align to the viral genome using Maq plus 45 s for SLOPE
to determine the junctions. Location of the viral insertion sites
on the same computer using Breakdancer required 7000 s for
alignment to the viral and X Chromosome reference sequences by
Maq, followed by 3300 s for BreakDancerMax to determine the
translocation. We note that in general, without the a priori knowledge
that the translocation partner was located on the X Chromosome, the
computational burden (and runtime) for the BreakDancer method
would increase by at least an order of magnitude.

Currently, SLOPE performs optimally given paired-end input.
However, SLOPE is also capable of determining breakpoints given
a single-end FASTQ ﬁle. We used Maq to simulate 75 bp reads
as above, now with 50-fold coverage (parameters: -N350 000
-r0.001 -R0) and analyzed only the FASTQ ﬁle for a single end.
Again, SLOPE successfully located the viral insertion sites in ﬁve
of ﬁve cases, requiring ~4100 s per case. The output was noisier,
however, and the slopes showed larger deviations from —1, with
wider conﬁdence intervals.

Finally, since SLOPE (by detecting breakpoints with respect to
a reference genome) locates not only translocations but also indels,
we compared its ability to detect randomly placed insertions and
deletions with that of BreakDancer (combined Max and Mini) and
Pindel (Ye et (11., 2009). This time, we used Maq to align the
reads to the truncated X Chromosome and counted the number
of insertions and deletions in the ranges small (1—5 bp), medium

(10—50 bp) and large (100—1000 bp) detected by each program. Since
SLOPE only detects breakpoints and prints alignments (but does
not specify insertion versus deletion), BreakDancer often cannot
discriminate between small insertions and small deletions, and all
three methods sometimes group neighboring indels together, we
deﬁned ‘successful location’ of an indel as detecting any breakpoint,
insertion or deletion covering or within a 10bp radius of the true
position.

Of the three methods, Pindel performed the fastest, requiring
60s on a Intel Xeon 2.93GHz powered server with 14 GB of
RAM, and successﬁilly identiﬁed 92—95% of indels in all categories
tested except for the large insertions, of which it detected only
17%, and made only two false positive calls (Fig. 3). SLOPE
was intermediate in speed (829 s) and provided highly accurate
results (93—100% success rate) for medium and large insertions and
deletions. However, SLOPE proved less accurate for small insertions
and deletions, attaining success rates of 58 and 49%, respectively,
and detected 39 false positive Chimeric reads. BreakDancer was
the slowest of the three methods, requiring 5100 s to run both
BreakDancerMax and BreakDancerMini. It performed well for
medium and large deletions and moderately well for medium-
sized insertions, attaining accuracies of 72—95%. BreakDancer did
not perform as well for small deletions, small insertions or large
insertions, attaining accuracies of between 6 and 15%, and produced
over 2200 false positives. In order to reduce the large number of false
positives called by BreakDancer, we counted only the top 50% or
the top 15% (by Breakdancer score) of hits. However, this increase
in speciﬁcity resulted in a considerable loss of sensitivity (Fig. 3).

4 DISCUSSION

SLOPE is a fast and accurate tool for locating translocations and
other structural variants from targeted, resequenced DNA. SLOPE

was faster and more accurate than BreakDancer in detecting real
and simulated insertion sites for MCPyV. SLOPE also required a
much faster preprocessing step, alignment of the paired-end data
to only the short viral genome, as compared with BreakDancer
which required pre-alignment to a much larger genome (in general,
the entire human genome). SLOPE also had higher sensitivity and
speciﬁcity than BreakDancer for detecting indels from simulated
data. SLOPE was not quite as fast as or as speciﬁc as Pindel
for indel detection. However, except in the case of the smallest
indels, SLOPE’s sensitivity compared favorably with that of Pindel,
which also does not detect translocations. In addition to the
efﬁciency attained by aligning only to the targeted reference genome,
SLOPE has the advantage of SNP and gap-tolerant alignments.
This tolerance may be an important feature for a program used to
interrogate genomes of cancerous cells. We do emphasize, however,
that SLOPE is suitable only for targeted, resequenced DNA. For
whole-genome searches, a program such as BreakDancer, which
searches for discordant paired reads to detect structural variants in
general, or Pindel, which uses a fast, but SNP-intolerant, pattern-
matching algorithm to detect indels, would be preferable (Chen
et (11., 2009; Ye et (11., 2009).

Another useﬁil feature of SLOPE is its ability to provide single-
base resolution of Chimeric reads. Translocations are thought to
underlie a wide variety of tumor types, and speciﬁc Chromosomal
rearrangements have prognostic value (Mitelman et (11., 2007).
Current methods to detect translocations, including cytogenetics and
ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), provide only a very low
resolution indicator of the Chromosomal aberration. Furthermore,
cytogenetic studies require actively dividing cultured cells, which
are not always available, especially in the case of solid tumors.
The ability to accurately locate and Characterize translocations from
a variety of specimen substrates including the ubiquitous FFPE
tissue may provide further diagnostic information, and may help
to elucidate the mechanisms by which these translocations arise.

Currently, SLOPE performs optimally for paired-end reads, since
this allows the sample to be narrowed to only those reads for which
one end maps (in its entirety) to the reference genome. The algorithm
works in just the same way for single-end reads, however. This
is an important advantage in terms of analyzing data for Clinical
use, as paired-end sequencing takes up to 5 days as compared 3
days for single-end sequencing. Use of single-end reads results in a
widened sample space and somewhat noisier output. It also results in
a much slower search, although the algorithm is trivial to parallelize.
Future work will speed this search using a more sophisticated string
matching algorithm.

Given its ability to quickly and accurately deﬁne translocation
breakpoints from target-enriched sequence data, SLOPE is
well-suited to both research and Clinical applications. For example,
the Myeloid Leukemia Lymphoma (MLL) gene on 11q23 is
commonly translocated in both acute myeloid leukemia and
acute lymphoblastic lymphoma. However, as more than 80
MLL translocation partners are known, identiﬁcation of partner
genes by FISH is problematic. Use of a targeted sequence-
enrichment approach (in this case for the MLL gene), followed
by next-generation sequencing, and application of SLOPE could
theoretically identify all such translocations regardless of breakpoint
location or partner gene. Additionally, as next-generation sequencing
methods are readily amenable to FFPE tissue blocks, identiﬁcation
of recurring translocations could easily be accomplished from

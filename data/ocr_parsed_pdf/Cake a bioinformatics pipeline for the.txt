(Stephens et al., 2012). The performance of each variant—calling
algorithm was evaluated by running each one individually using
their default settings and filtering the results using the post—pro—
cessing filters implemented in Cake. The results are summarized
in Table l.

3.1 Human hepatocellular carcinoma dataset

In their study, Guichard et a]. (2012) experimentally validated
850 SNV positions, of which 8 were not covered by sequence
reads following realignment leaving a target reference set of 842.
Using Cake with an intersection of any two or more algorithms,
812 validated variants were retained (Supplementary Fig. S3),
representing an overall sensitivity of 96.4%. An average of 634
variants was predicted per exome (Table 1). Cake outperformed
the best single algorithm in terms of speciﬁcity and the number
of variants reported per sample.

3.2 Human breast cancer exome dataset

Because the above analysis will favour callers that perform like
CASAVA, and because we did not have DNA from the hepato—
cellular carcinomas for follow—up analysis to ascertain the false
positive and negative rates, we next used exome data from two
breast tumours for which whole genome ampliﬁed tumour and
germline DNA was in hand. Using Cake and an intersection of
any two or more callers, we made 1225 calls (per sample
613 :I: 42), of which 254 were from a reference call set represent—
ing a subset of positions (264) covered by the capture baits where
a somatic mutation had resulted in a non—synonymous change; a
sensitivity of 96.2% (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. S4). Excluding
CaVEMan, which was used in the original study, Cake again
outperformed all other algorithms (Table 1).

To assess the speciﬁcity of the somatic variant calling by Cake,
we used the Sequenom MassARRAY SNP genotyping platform
on tumour and germline DNA samples. A total of 400 variants
were randomly selected from the 1225 calls made by any two or
more callers in the Cake pipeline, 200 from each sample. Two
hundred and seventy variants were validated, including 95 som—
atic mutations conﬁrmed in the original study, 111 somatic

mutation that were not described previously and 64 germline
variants (Supplementary Fig. S5). Importantly, we called
variants in a greater target region than the original study by
analyzing positions in 5/ and 3/ untranslated regions, and introns.
Six additional non—synonymous SNVs were discovered and con—
ﬁrmed (Supplementary Table 3), including variants in AKAPI,
PCN T and RERE, all of which have been implicated in cancer.

A further 400 variants were included as a true negative set
resulting in a worst—case accuracy for Cake of 75.8%
[Accuracy=(95+ 111 +400)/(400+400)]. Although we used
our default of at least any two callers as part of the aforemen—
tioned analysis, 88.3% of positions that validated as somatic
variants were reported by all four algorithms used by Cake
(Supplementary Fig. S5, Table 1). This indicates that merging
predictions increases the probability of identifying true muta—
tions. Thus, we demonstrate that Cake may be used to help pri—
oritize somatic SNVs calls for follow—up validation.

4 SUMMARY

Here we describe Cake, a software tool integrating four somatic
variant detection algorithms to call variants with higher accuracy
and specificity than any one algorithm alone. Cake performs well
on whole genomes, exomes and targeted next—generation
sequencing data, as well as on both human and mouse samples.
Cake is freely available to the research community.

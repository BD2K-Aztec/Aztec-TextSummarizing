BroadPeak

 

Gibbs sampling algorithm (Robert and Casella, 2004) is applied to esti-
mate p and q (Supplementary Methods).

Peak identification: BroadPeak applies the linear time RuzzoiTompa
algorithm (Ruzzo and Tompa, 1999) to search for all maximal scoring
segments (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). For each maximal scoring
segment, the observed spatial density of high-tag bins is compared with
the background using a z-test, and only the segments with significantly
higher densities (P<0.05) are added to the final broad peak list.

3 PERFORMANCEEVALUAHON

To evaluate the performance of BroadPeak, we ﬁrst applied the
algorithm to the analysis of ChIP—seq datasets of histone modiﬁca—
tions from human CD4+ T cells (Barski et al., 2007). Visual inspec—
tion of the called broad peaks shows that they are much consistent
with the underlying diffuse ChIP—seq tag count distributions
(Fig. 1A and B, Supplementary Fig. S3). For H3K36me3 and
H3K79me2, the called broad peaks are also highly coincident
with the locations of gene bodies (Fig. 1A), consistent with their
known roles as marks of transcriptional elongation (Barski et al.,
2007). Closer inspection reveals that the locations of the called peaks
for these two marks relative to gene bodies are distinct; H3K79me2
peaks are enriched at and downstream of transcriptional start sites,
whereas H3K36me3 peaks are enriched upstream and at transcrip—
tional termination sites (Fig. 1C). These results are also consistent
with the known biological roles of these modiﬁcations.
Additional biologically relevant results can be seen for the
called H3K27me3 peaks (Fig. 1B). H3K27me3 is thought to
mark repressive chromatin domains, and the edges of the
broad peaks called for this mark are enriched for binding sites
of the CTCF protein (Fig. 1B and D, Supplementary Fig. S4),

peaks of H3K79me2 and H3K36me3 identified by BroadPeak compared
with the underlying ChIP-seq tag counts. (B) Examples of broad peaks of

Relative distributions of broad peaks of H3K79me2 and H3K36me3
around gene bodies. (D) Enrichments of CTCF bindings around the
edges of large H3K27me3 broad peaks (>200 kb)

which is known to be related to the activity of chromatin insu—
lators and barriers (Cuddapah et al., 2009). Weaker enrichments
are also observed for called broad peaks of the H3K9me3
(Supplementary Fig. SS). Similar performances are shown
when the algorithm is run in supervised and unsupervised
modes for H3K36me3 (Supplementary Methods and Supple—
mentary Fig. S6).

We further evaluate the performance of BroadPeak using three
separate simulated ChIP—seq tag datasets, which correspond to a
set of predefined (i.e. known) broad peaks (Supplementary
Methods). This approach was used to allow for a controlled
comparison of results obtained from BroadPeak versus results
from the existing methods MACS, SICER and RSEG (Song and
Smith, 2011; Zang et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2008). For each
method tested, the ability to identify known broad peaks from
simulated tag datasets was quantified using precision and recall.
For all three simulated datasets, BroadPeak achieves substantial
improvements on recall (Supplementary Table Sl) while main—
taining good precision (albeit slightly lower than seen for MACS
and SICER). Overall, BroadPeak shows the highest value for the
harmonic mean of recall and precision (F score). Finally,
BroadPeak appears particularly well suited for calling large
peaks as can be seen from the more contiguous characterization
of known large peaks from the simulated datasets
(Supplementary Fig. S7) and the relatively broader distribution
of called peak sizes (Supplementary Fig. S8).

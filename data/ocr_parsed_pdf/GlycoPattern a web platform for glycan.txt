2.2 Motif discovery

A glycan array is interrogated with a GBP to determine the relative
binding strengths of all the glycans on the array (Smith et al., 2010).
The GlycanMotiﬂVIiner algorithm (Cholleti et al., 2012) functions by
automatically ﬁnding frequently occurring patterns in binding glycans.
The algorithm then incrementally discovers motifs of larger size and stops
when it cannot ﬁnd any motifs of next higher size. The algorithm uses a
threshold for the minimum number of glycans that contain the motif
along with a threshold for the maximum number of non-binding glycans
that contain the motif. Motifs are discovered and reported automatically
after data entry.

2.3 GBP-Motif hierarchical clustering

The proteinwarbohydrate resource of the CFG has screened hundreds
of GBPs to determine speciﬁcity for a glycan motif or determinant.
GlycoPattern performs a hierarchical clustering from the results
of GlycanMotiﬂVIiner on any number of experiments to generate a den-
drogram showing the similarity of different GBPs for the determinant(s)
they recognize.

The GBP Dendrogram is useful for selecting GBPs to do more ﬁne-
grained analysis to determine the similarities among related GBPs, and to
rapidly screen a large database to identify reagents to detect speciﬁc
glycans.

2.4 GBP—glycan heatmap

The GBPiglycan heatmap feature allows the user to select two or more
experiments (including experiments from different CFG Array versions)
and perform a side-by-side comparison of the glycans bound by any
number of GBPs. GlycoPattern allows the user to hover over a cell in
the Heatmap and display the glycan structure in symbolic representation.
This feature allows the user to determine which features of a glycan
structure are recognized by highly similar GBPs selected using the
GBP-motif hierarchical clustering feature.

2.5 Glycan search

GlycoPattern allows users to search for glycan substructures within an
experiment. The user interface requires the use of the modiﬁed IUPAC
condensed nomenclature. The search supports hierarchical queries that
represent the branching in certain glycan sequences where branching
is noted with an opening and closing parenthesis around a sequence.
The search function parses the modiﬁed IUPAC condensed nomenclature
and converts it into Javascript Object Notation (JSON) format. When
searching for a branched input sequence, the search function ﬁnds any
match within a glycan structure for the input sequence rather than an
exact match. This is useful when dealing with sequences that have more
than two branch points from a single monosaccharide.

3 RESULTS

GlycoPattern is one of the few publicly available informatics
resources available for mining Glycan Array data. At the time
of writing, there are >50 international registered users that are
not afﬁliated with Emory University with >400 experiments
total. It was originally developed as a resource for the CFG,
but we plan to expand its capabilities beyond the CFG to
make it more accessible to the entire Glycobiology community.
In our planned future work, GlycoPattern will be adapted
to handle any defined glycan library using a format such as

Glyde—II or CabosML (Kikuchi et al., 2005) to convert the struc—
tures into a GlycoPattern—readable format. Some of the authors
are members of the joint international consortium for the
Minimum Information Required for a Glycomics Experiment
(York et al., 2014) and are actively working on developing stand—
ards to represent glycan microarrays similar to the efforts of the
Minimum Information Required for a Microarray Experiment
(Spellman et al., 2002) and (Rayner et al., 2006). Once standards
are adopted, sharing, querying and analysis of data can be facili—
tated and will eventually lead to more maturity in the develop—
ment of bioinformatics tools for the glycobiology community.

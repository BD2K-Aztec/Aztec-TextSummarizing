Abstract

Motivation: Frameshifting (FS) indels and nonsense (NS) variants disrupt the protein—coding se—
quence downstream of the mutation site by changing the reading frame or introducing a prema—
ture termination codon, respectively. Despite such drastic changes to the protein sequence, FS
indels and NS variants have been discovered in healthy individuals. How to discriminate disease—
causing from neutral FS indels and NS variants is an understudied problem.

Results: We have built a machine learning method called DDIG—in (FS) based on real human gen—
etic variations from the Human Gene Mutation Database (inherited disease—causing) and the 1000
Genomes Project (GP) (putatively neutral). The method incorporates both sequence and predicted
structural features and yields a robust performance by 10—fold cross—validation and independent
tests on both FS indels and NS variants. We showed that human—derived NS variants and FS indels
derived from animal orthologs can be effectively employed for independent testing of our method
trained on human—derived FS indels. DDIG—in (FS) achieves a Matthews correlation coefficient
(MCC) of 0.59, a sensitivity of 86%, and a specificity of 72% for FS indels. Application of DDIG—in
(FS) to NS variants yields essentially the same performance (MCC of 0.43) as a method that was
specifically trained for NS variants. DDIG—in (FS) was shown to make a significant improvement
over existing techniques.

Availability and implementation: The DDIG—in web—server for predicting NS variants, FS indels,
and non—frameshifting (NFS) indels is available at http://sparks—Iab.0rg/ddig.

1 Introduction

A key requirement for personalized medicine is to fully annotate
human genetic variations in different individuals. Some genetic
variations are benign, while others are disease—causing or disease—
associated. In addition to single nucleotide variations that change a
single amino acid in a protein sequence (missense mutations), a large
fraction of pathological human genetic variations are caused by non—
sense (NS) mutations [comprising 11% (Stenson et al., 2014)] where
a single nucleotide variation introduces a premature termination
codon (PTC), and by microinsertions and microdeletions [indels,
comprising 24% (Ball et al., 2005)] that involve the insertion or de—
letion of 320 nucleotides. In exonic (protein—coding) regions, indels
can be frameshifting (FS) or non—frameshifting (NFS) depending
upon whether or not the indel in question inserts or deletes a mul—
tiple of three nucleotides. NFS indels insert/delete multiples of three
nucleotides and hence do not alter the coding region, comprising
three—nucleotide codons, other than at the indel site. On the other
hand, FS indels, having a length indivisible by three, shift the reading
frame and alter the coding sequence downstream of the indel site,
which depending on the location and downstream sequence context
of the indel may introduce a PTC. Thus, both FS indels and NS vari—
ants alter the entire coding sequence downstream from the variation
site. As a result, they are often assumed to have a significant
functional impact and to be potentially disease—causing. Indeed, NS
variants account for ~20% of all disease—associated single base
substitutions (Mort et al., 2008). However, a considerable number
of NS variants and FS indels have been identified as being benign in
recent studies (McVean et al., 2010; Mills et al., 2011). How to dis—
tinguish neutral from potentially disease—causing FS indels and NS
variants is therefore of both practical and fundamental interest.

The functional effects of FS indels and NS variants are poorly
understood although variations which introduce a PTC and activate
nonsense—mediated decay (NMD) are more likely to come to clinical
attention (Mort et al., 2008). Additionally, FS indels and NS vari—
ants may disrupt pre—mRNA splicing with around ~31% of disease—
causing NS variants predicted to disrupt splicing (Mort et al., 2014).
It is therefore clear that the functional impact of this class of variants
(FS indels and NS mutations) is not always straightforward to inter—
pret and currently most available methods for discriminating dele—
terious and neutral genetic variants are devoted exclusively to
missense mutations. Examples are SIFT (Ng and Henikoff, 2001),
PolyPhen (Adzhubei et al., 2010) or MutPred (Li et al., 2009), for
recent reviews see Thusberg et al. (2011) or Bendl et al. (2014).
Although there are several methods for NFS indels [DDIG—in (NFS)
(Zhao et al., 2013), SIFT Indel (Hu and Ng, 2013), PROVEAN
(Choi et al., 2012), PinPor (Zhang et al., 2014) and KD4i (Bermejo—
Das—Neves et al., 2014)], there are only three methods available for
PS indels and two for NS variants. D—score (Zia and Moses, 2011)
ranks FS indels and NS variants based on the loss of protein infor—
mation content derived from the conservation of the target protein
sequence without specific training. SIFT Indel (Hu and Ng, 2012) is
a decision tree trained on disease—causing FS indels annotated in the
Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) (Stenson et al., 2014)
and neutral indels from pairwise alignments between human pro—
teins and their functional orthologs in cow, dog, horse, chimpanzee,
rhesus macaque and rat. SIFT Indel employs four features: fraction
of affected conserved DNA bases, relative indel location, fraction of

affected conserved amino acids, and indel distance to the exon
boundary. CADD (Combined Annotation—Dependent Depletion)
(Kircher et al., 2014) is a general framework for predicting all pos—
sible types of genetic variations. It is based on a support vector ma—
chine (SVM) model trained with a variety of features including
scores calculated with other methods such as SIFT (Ng and
Henikoff, 2001) and PolyPhen (Adzhubei et al., 2010). The training
neutral dataset was compiled from variants between human and
inferred human—chimpanzee common ancestral genomes. The train—
ing deleterious dataset was created using a genome—wide simulator
of de novo germline mutations.

In this article, we have built the first machine learning technique
for PS indels and NS variants trained entirely on actual human vari—
ants, rather than on simulated deleterious variants (CADD) or vari—
ants derived from orthologous animal proteins (SIFT Indel).
Moreover, we investigated the application of structural properties,
which have been shown to be important for the classification of NFS
indels (Zhao et al., 2013) and missense mutations (Adzhubei et al.,
2010; Li et al., 2009). By utilizing disease—causing variants anno—
tated in the HGMD (Stenson et al., 2014) and putatively neutral
variants from the 1000 GP (McVean et al., 2010), we found that the
most discriminative feature for PS indels and NS variants was the
disruption of DNA conservation, rather than the disruption of pro—
tein structure as in the case of NFS indels. The best combination of
eight features identified by a feature selection algorithm was used to
build the final SVM model named DDIG—in (FS) (Detecting DIsease—
causing Genetic variations). More importantly, the method de—
veloped here was subjected to rigorous independent testing. These
tests included the use of FS indels derived from functional animal
orthologs as a neutral dataset (the SIFT Indel neutral dataset) and
the use of NS variants for testing the method trained on PS indels.
Here, we have rationalized the possible equivalence between FS
indels and NS variants by their effect on the protein sequence: FS
indels effectively render the protein sequence meaningless after the
indel site, and probably have the same effect as truncation of the
protein induced by a NS variant. DDIG—in (FS) achieved a Matthews
correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.59 and 0.54 for the 10—fold
cross—validation and independent test (on non—overlapping HGMD
disease—causing indels and neutral indels from the SIFT Indel data—
set), respectively, compared with an MCC of 0.38 and 0.35 for
CADD. A very different performance, MCC of 0.29 and 0.63 for
the two different datasets, was observed for SIFT Indel. The robust
performance of DDIG—in (FS) was further confirmed by an inde—
pendent dataset of NS variants and negative correlation with aver—
age allele frequency (AF) in the presumably healthy population from
the 1000 GP.

2 Methods

2.1 Datasets

We describe the datasets used in this work below. For details on
how we compiled these datasets, refer to Supplementary Methods.
The dataset of inherited disease—causing and putatively neutral FS
indels in coding regions was retrieved from the HGMD (version
Professional 2012.2) (Stenson et al., 2014) and 1000 GP (phase 1,
version 3, 20101123) (McVean et al., 2010), respectively. The final
FS indels dataset comprised 660 disease—causing and 580 neutral

indels in 660 and 491 protein—coding genes, respectively. We also
built an independent test set from non—overlapping disease—causing
HGMD indels and neutral indels from the SIFT Indel training data—
set, which was derived from functional animal orthologs (Hu and
Ng, 2012). The final HGMD+SIFT FS indels dataset contained
2008 disease—causing and 2008 neutral FS indels in 737 and 1996
genes, respectively. Importantly, the HGMD + SIFT FS indels data—
set had a sequence similarity 330% to the FS indels dataset.
Another independent test set comprised NS variants derived from
the HGMD (disease—causing) and 1000 GP (neutral). The final NS
variants dataset contained 3861 disease—causing and 3861 neutral
variants in 1122 and 2989 genes, respectively. Also the NS variants
dataset had a sequence similarity 330% to the FS indels dataset.
Table 1 depicts how these three datasets were utilized for training
and testing of our two distinct methods [DDIG—in (FS) and DDIG—in
(Nsll

2.2 Machine learning features

We evaluated 36 different features (see Supplementary Methods and
Supplementary Table S1) that could be used for discriminating be—
tween disease—causing and neutral FS indels as well as NS variants.
We used the sequential forward floating selection (SFFS) algorithm
(Pudil et al., 1994) to find an effective combination of features
which we used for training the final SVM model (Cortes and
Vapnik, 1995). Details on how we performed the feature selection
and optimized the SVM model can be found in Supplementary
Methods.

2.2.1 Global features

We considered four global gene-level features. Feature Ka/KS ratio
was calculated as the ratio of the number of non—synonymous (Ka)
and synonymous (KS) substitutions in a given gene. Ka/KS ratio is
commonly used as an indicator of selective pressure acting on a pro—
tein—coding gene (Hurst, 2002). We downloaded pre—calculated Ka
and K; values for the human—chimpanzee, human—macaque, human—
mouse and human—rat alignments from Ensembl (release 75) (Flicek
et al., 2013) and calculated the average Ka/KS ratio for the four
alignments.

As a gene may contain exons separated by introns, we examined
the following features for evidence of a variant affecting alternative
splicing: number of transcripts, fraction of unaffected transcripts
and fraction of translatable transcripts. Here, an unaffected tran—
script (splice isoform) is one for which the variation is located within
an intron (while the variation is located in an exon for some other
splice isoform of the same gene). The number of translatable

We ensured that the two datasets used for testing DDIG-in (FS) were mutu-
ally independent from the DDIG-in (FS) training dataset by removing genes
with protein sequences that had a pairwise sequence identity >30%.

transcripts is given as the number of transcripts which would not be
candidates for non—stop decay (NSD) or NMD induced by the gen—
etic variation. NSD and NMD are mRNA surveillance mechanisms
which prevent translation of damaged genes. We considered a vari—
ant to be a candidate for NSD if it lacked a PTC (van Hoof et al.,
2002). A variant was considered to be a NMD candidate if the gen—
etic variation occurred more than 49 nucleotides (discounting inter—
vening introns) from the 3’ —most intron (Nagy and Maquat, 1998).
We also examined nine global transcript-level features (calcu—
lated as the average, minimum or maximum of all transcripts of the
given gene): number of exons; relative exon number; distance to the
nearest upstream (downstream) splice site; relative distance to the 5’
end, 3’ end and centre of the sequence; relative length of the variant;
and relative length of the mutated sequence. The details on how we
calculated these features can be found in Supplementary Methods.

2.2.2 Local features

With the exception of a nucleotide-level feature DNA conservation,
all other local features were protein-level features. The DNA conser—
vation was derived from phylogenetic P—values of the multiple align—
ments of 45 vertebrates to the human genome calculated with the
phyloP program (Pollard et al., 2010). We downloaded pre—
calculated phyloP scores from the UCSC Table Browser (Karolchik
et al., 2004).

On the protein-level, we used PSI—BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997)
(NCBI non—redundant database, three iterations, e—value threshold
of 0.001) to create a position—specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and
weighted observed percentages matrix from which we calculated
feature PSSM conservation (the equation is given in Supplementary
Methods).

We also considered six entropy—based protein conservation
scores which were studied and implemented by Capra and Singh
(2007). The best performance using cross—validation on the training
set was achieved by Shannon entropy (SE) calculated from the 30
most related sequences (ranked by the e—value threshold) from the
multiple sequence alignment generated with PSI—BLAST (see above).
The feature protein conservation (SE) was scaled to fit in the range
(0, 1) where 1 is the highest protein conservation.

Ten other protein conservation features were calculated using
HHblits (Remmert et al., 2012) from hidden Markov model se—
quence profiles. Details about these features are provided in
Supplementary Methods.

Finally, we considered five structural features predicted from the
protein sequence: relative accessible surface area, belix, sbeet, coil
and disorder probabilities. The accessible surface area and second—
ary structure probabilities were all predicted using SPINE—X
(Faraggi et al., 2009, 2011). The disorder probability was calculated
using SPINE—D (Zhang et al., 2012).

2.2.3 Feature extraction of local features

Whereas the global features were calculated as a single—valued prop—
erty of the whole coding sequence or the protein product, local fea—
tures quantified a given property over a window of neighbouring
coding bases (residues) of the given gene (protein). The window en—
compassed all bases (residues) from the variation site to the 3’ end
(C—terminus) plus n bases (residues) from the variation site towards
the 5’ end (N—terminus). We refer to this window as the lost-
sequence window. We also considered two other types of windows,
small-symmetric and next-splice (see Supplementary Methods), but
they yielded a lower performance as evaluated with one nucleotide—
level feature (DNA conservation) and one protein—level feature

(PSSM conservation). We used the same two features to optimize
the window length for the lost—sequence window. The best perform—
ance using cross—validation on the training set was achieved with
n:40 bases for DNA conservation and n:5 residues for PSSM
conservation. We kept the window length fixed for all other features
in all experiments.

Each local feature was encoded as average, minimum, or max—
imum within the lost—sequence window. In addition, we also calcu—
lated the number of bases (residues) for which the value of the
feature was higher than a threshold t within the given window rela—
tive to the number of bases (residues) in the given window (H‘) or
relative to the number of bases (residues) with feature values >t for
the entire nucleotide (protein) sequence (Hg). Thus, a total of five
encoding metbods denoted as avg, min, max, H‘ and Hg. Threshold
t was optimized for each local feature individually (Supplementary
Table 51 ).

2.3 Evaluation

We used 10—fold cross—validation on the FS indels dataset to design
our method, select relevant features, and optimize all parameters
(window type, window length, SVM parameters, etc.). To avoid
over—training on specific genes, we ensured that no two cross—valid—
ation folds shared similar sequences. This means that all indels of
any cluster of similar sequences were contained within a single fold.
The clusters were determined with protein—level Blastclust (Altschul
et al., 1990) with a sequence similarity threshold of 30%. In add—
ition, we kept the ratio of disease—causing and neutral indels reason—
ably similar between the folds. We replicated our experiments 100
times with randomly re—generated folds, averaged the results and
calculated standard deviations. Because we had an abundance of dis—
ease—causing variants from the HGMD (see Supplementary
Methods), each of the 100 replications used a different random sam—
ple of disease—causing FS indels. We employed the HGMD +SIFT
FS indels and the NS variants datasets for independent testing of our
method. Importantly, these datasets did not share sequences with
>30% sequence similarity with the training FS indels dataset.
Again, we replicated all experiments 100 times with random sam—
pling of the disease—causing variants.

We assessed the overall prediction performance in terms of the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under
the ROC curve (AUC). An ROC curve plots the true positive rate
(sensitivity) as a function of the false positive rate (1—specificity) at
different prediction thresholds. Furthermore, we calculated MCC,
binary classification accuracy (Q2), sensitivity (Se, recall), specificity
(Sp), positive predictive value (PPV, precision), and negative predict—
ive value (NPV). The equations of these evaluation measures are
given in Supplementary Methods.

3 Results

3.1 Single feature performance on F8 indels dataset

We first examined the ability of each of the 36 individual machine
learning features (Supplementary Table 51) to discriminate between
the disease—causing and neutral FS indels. Table 2 ranks the 10 best
performing features and their best performing encoding methods ac—
cording to the AUC along with other measures including MCC and
Q2. The top three most discriminative features were the fraction of
highly conserved DNA positions with an AUC of 0.83, followed by
the minimum protein conservation calculated as Shannon entropy
(SE) (AUC of 0.74), and the ratio of the number of non—synonymous
(Ka) and synonymous (KS) substitutions in a given gene (AUC of

0.74). Other important features were sequence conservation scores
based on the PSSM and hidden Markov model profiles from
HHblits, features related to RNA splicing (number of exons and
relative exon number), protein structural features (predicted coil
probability and relative accessible surface area), and the fraction of
translatable transcripts.

Figure 1 depicts the distributions of the top three features [DNA
conservation, protein conservation (SE), and Ka/KS ratio] for dis—
ease—causing and neutral FS indels. Disease—causing indels occurred
more frequently within regions with higher fractions of conserved
DNA bases and with higher minimal protein conservation scores
and in genes with low Ka/KS ratios (i.e. fewer mutations that change
amino acid residues). The results summarized in Table 2 and
Figure 1 demonstrate that sequence conservation in different forms
and at different molecular levels (DNA or protein) yielded the best
discrimination of disease—causing FS indels.

3.2 Feature selection and 10—fold cross—validation with
FS indels dataset

We employed SVM and a greedy SFFS algorithm to select a well—
performing subset from 54 diverse feature+enc0ding pairs
(Supplementary Table 52). SFFS selected eight features
(Supplementary Table S3) including the three best features [DNA
conservation, protein conservation (SE), and Ka/KS ratio] from our
single—feature experiment (previous section). Four additional fea—
tures were related to the top 10 features from Table 2 [PSSM conser—
vation (average and fraction of highly conserved residues), and
fractions of translatable and unaffected transcripts]. One new fea—
ture was the minimum of the predicted disorder probability within
the lost—sequence window. Most of these features reflected either the
local conservation in sequence (DNA and protein) and structure
(protein), or the global conservation of a gene (Ka/KS ratio). For con—
venience, we refer to the final SVM model encompassing these eight
features as the DDIG—in (FS) method.

DDIG—in (FS) yielded an AUC of 0.87 and MCC of 0.59
(Table 3). Sensitivity and specificity reached 86 and 72%, respect—
ively. Whereas DNA conservation performed quite well on its own,
DDIG—in (FS) still yielded an absolute (relative) improvement of
0.04 (5%) for AUC and 0.05 (9%) for MCC. Figure 2a compares
the performance of DDIG—in (FS) with the performance of the top
three features in terms of ROC curves. We also compared the per—
formance of our method with two other available methods: SIFT
Indel (Hu and Ng, 2012) for predicting damaging FS indels and

used previously for methods for the prediction of damaging missense
variants (Adzhubei et al., 2010; Li et al., 2009) or the prediction of
mutation-induced stability changes (Folkman et al., 2014a,b). We
replicated our experiments 100 times with randomly generated folds
while maintaining the ratio of the disease-causing and neutral vari-
ants. This strict cross-validation coupled with the sequential for-
ward floating feature selection (Pudil et al., 1994) led to a robust
performance in two fully independent tests, which in turn confirmed
that DDIG-in (FS) was not over-trained (Tables 3 and 4).

Our method differs from two other available methods, SIFT
Indel (Hu and Ng, 2012) and CADD (Kircher et al., 2014), in train-
ing. CADD was trained with disease-causing variants from a gen-
ome-wide simulation of de novo germline mutations and neutral
variants between human and inferred human-chimpanzee common
ancestral genomes. SIFT Indel was trained with disease-causing FS
indels from the HGMD and neutral variants between human and
orthologous animal proteins. By contrast, both disease-causing and
neutral indels for training DDIG-in (FS) were from known human
variations (HGMD and 1000 GP, respectively).

Our new method also differs from previous techniques by
utilizing features from predicted structural properties of proteins.
Nonetheless, the three most prominent features in our method were
all related to sequence conservation (Table 2). In agreement with
related work [SIFT Indel (Hu and Ng, 2012)], DNA conservation
was the single-most important feature, while those features based on
predicted structural properties of proteins were significantly less dis-
criminative. By comparison, the most discriminative feature for NFS
indels (Zhao et al., 2013) was the disruption of structured regions
predicted by protein disorder predictor SPINE—D (Zhang et al.,
2012). This highlights the difference between local sequence disrup-
tion induced by NFS indels and the global sequence disruption
induced by FS indels and NS variants. Indeed, the direct application
of DDIG-in (FS) to a NFS indels dataset results in a significantly
poorer performance [MCC of 0.42 compared with 0.68 by DDIG-in
(NFS) (Zhao etal., 2013)].

Unlike previously developed methods, DDIG-in (FS) was sub-
jected to rigorous independent testing by applying it directly to NS
variants. Here, we assumed the equivalence between FS indels and
NS variants because FS indels effectively render the protein sequence
meaningless after the indel site, and probably have the same effect as
truncation of the protein induced by a NS variant. This equivalence
was supported by similar distributions of three predictive features
(DNA conservation, protein conservation, and Ka/KS ratio) for NS
variants and FS indels (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Fig. 1, respect-
ively). The equivalence is further supported by the fact that DDIG-in
(NS), directly optimized and trained for NS variants, was only

marginally better (AUC of 0.72 compared with 0.70) than the inde-
pendent test performance of our ‘main’ method, DDIG-in (FS),
which was designed solely using a dataset of FS indels (see Section
3.4). The performance of DDIG-in (FS) was lower for NS variants
as compared with FS indels, but the possible difference between
these two distinct types of variants is unlikely to be the main cause.
We found that the neutral NS variants dataset comprised a signifi-
cant proportion of extremely rare variants with AF 3 0.1%. By com-
parison, AFs for all neutral FS indels were 20.3%. When we tested
DDIG-in (FS) only on neutral NS variants with AF 2 0.3%, the pre-
diction performance was comparable to the performance on FS
indels (AUC of 0.86 and 0.87, respectively). Thus, the main reason
for a lower performance of DDIG-in (FS) on NS variants was the
presence of false negatives in the neutral NS variants dataset.

Another means of independent testing is by the use of AF, the oc-
currence frequency of a particular variant in a given population. AF
results from multiple factors arising from the complicated inter-
actions between human beings and their environment. Many rare al-
leles are both population-specific and of functional significance
(Marth et al., 2011), whereas frequent alleles (for late-onset dis-
eases, in particular) are not necessarily benign. Thus, the fitness of
the allele with respect to its associated biological function is likely
an underlying trend that appears only after averaging (removing
noise from other factors) (Hu and Ng, 2013; Zhao et al., 2013).
This correlation with the average AF values but not with the individ-
ual AF values is illustrated in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S2,
respectively.

In this work, we assumed that FS indels and NS variants identi-
fied by the 1000 GP are neutral. Although this assumption is not un-
reasonable, there might be false negatives (disease-causing variants
labelled as neutral) in our datasets. Indeed, rare neutral NS variants
(AF30.1%) have led to poorer performance of CADD, DDIG-in
(FS), and DDIG-in (NS) (Table 4). Interestingly, we found that
DDIG-in (NS) trained and evaluated only on neutral variants with
AF>0.1% yields an AUC of 0.76, significantly worse than 0.82
given by DDIG-in (NS) trained with all neutral variants. Thus, the
benefit resulting from a larger number of neutral variants outweighs
the potential for false negatives for some rare variants. Similar be-
haviour was observed for NFS indels (Zhao et al., 2013). Utilizing
variants from the 1000 GP as our neutral dataset is further sup-
ported by the consistent performance of DDIG-in (FS) when these
neutral variants were replaced by variants derived from animal
orthologs from the SIFT Indel training dataset. Moreover, the distri-
butions of sequence conservation features for neutral FS indels from
the 1000 GP are similar to those from the SIFT Indel training dataset
(Fig. 1).

Abstract

Motivation: The ability to jointly learn gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in, or leverage GRNs be—
tween related species would allow the vast amount of legacy data obtained in model organisms to
inform the GRNs of more complex, or economically or medically relevant counterparts. Examples
include transferring information from Arabidopsis thaliana into related crop species for food secur—
ity purposes, or from mice into humans for medical applications. Here we develop two related
Bayesian approaches to network inference that allow GRNs to be jointly inferred in, or leveraged
between, several related species: in one framework, network information is directly propagated be—
tween species; in the second hierarchical approach, network information is propagated via an
unobserved 'hypernetwork’. In both frameworks, information about network similarity is captured
via graph kernels, with the networks additionally informed by species—specific time series gene
expression data, when available, using Gaussian processes to model the dynamics of gene
expression.

Results: Results on in silico benchmarks demonstrate that joint inference, and leveraging of known
networks between species, offers better accuracy than standalone inference. The direct propaga—
tion of network information via the non—hierarchical framework is more appropriate when there are
relatively few species, while the hierarchical approach is better suited when there are many spe—
cies. Both methods are robust to small amounts of mislabelling of orthologues. Finally, the use of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae data and networks to inform inference of networks in the budding yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe predicts a novel role in cell cycle regulation for Gas1
(SPAC1QB12.02c), a 1,3—beta—glucanosyltransferase.

1 Introduction

The gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of related species should
share common topological features with one another by virtue of a
shared ancestry. Consequentially, the joint inference (J1) of GRNs
from gene expression datasets collected from different species
should result in better overall accuracy in the inferred networks, due
to the increased amount of data from which to learn the shared com—
ponents (Gholami and Fellenberg, 2010; Joshi et (11., 2014; Kashima
et (11., 2009; Zhang and Moret, 2010). Similarly, the leveraging of a
GRN that has been experimentally verified in one species into a
related species should also improve the accuracy of inferred net—
works. Both tasks are related, and require the leveraging of data

between species, either in the form of multiple time series gene ex—
pression datasets, as is the case for J1, or combinations of times ser—
ies gene expression data with experimentally verified networks
during network leveraging (NL). Due to the increasing availability
of heterogeneous datasets in a range of species, flexible approaches
to network inference that can be adapted to both J1 and NL tasks
should be particularly useful, and would allow vast amounts of data
and information available in model organisms to be translated into
more complex or medically or economically relevant ones.

Although a number of methods that can directly leverage
networks from one species to another exist, such as network align—
ment algorithms (Clark and Kalita, 2014) or graph kernels

(Towfic et (11., 2009), these algorithms do not, typically, utilize other
available data, such as time series, to refine the networks.
Additionally, network alignment methods are of limited utility
where little is known about the network in one of the species. Some
existing approaches that could be adapted to, or have been applied
to, J1/NL between species exist, provided that the orthologues can
be mapped 1:1 between the species (Oates et (11., 2014; Penfold
et (11., 2012; Wang et (11., 2006; Zhao et (11., 2013). However, com—
plete lists of orthologues may not always exist or may be incomplete
or incorrect. One—to—one mapping, however, may not always be pos—
sible due to gene or chromosome duplications. This effect may be
particularly compounded in plant species where whole ancestral
genomes may be duplicated, or where hybridization events can re—
sult in multiple ancestral genomes being combined into a single
organism (Soltis and Soltis, 2009). In cases where no orthologues
are known beforehand, associations can be assigned within the in—
ference procedure (Gholami and Fellenberg, 2010). In the study by
Gholami and Fellenberg (2010) and other approaches for J1 in mul—
tiple species (Joshi et (11., 2014), inferred networks represent an aver—
age network rather than a species—specific one. Biologically, the set
of genes in one species may not fully correspond to the genes in an—
other due to loss of genes, emergence of proto—genes (Carvunis et (11.,
2012) or horizontal gene transfers (Boto, 2010), and the network
connections themselves may undergo rearrangement due to evolu—
tionary processes acting on the promoter regions of the genes or on
coding sequences, or else due to context—specific effects arising in the
different experimental conditions. These differences in network
structure may be just as significant as the underlying similarities,
and should therefore be inferred alongside the core aspects of the
network, that is, while it is desirable to share information between
species, we nonetheless wish to retain species—specific elements.
Increasingly, it is common to measure time series data (Breeze
et (11., 2011; Windram et (11., 2012), from which directed graphs can
be inferred. Consequentially, new methods and approaches are
needed that can handle time series data, are ﬂexible enough to deal
with multiple orthologues and can be readily adapted to both J1 and
NL when required. Previous approaches that can do so include the
work by Zhang and Moret (2010), which uses heuristic models for
evolution, demonstrating the general usefulness of multi—species net—
work inference in silica and in Drosophila. In this article, we de—
velop two related Bayesian approaches to network inference
(Sections 2.1 and 2.2) that allow both the J1 of GRNs in related spe—
cies from time series data, and the leveraging of networks from one
species to another, even when multiple copies of an orthologue exist.
In particular, each node in the respective networks may be assigned
a node label according to which orthologues the node has. This
labelling may come from manually curated lists of orthologues or
can be computed according to sequence similarity. Crucially, graph
kernels are used to quantify the similarity between labelled graphs,
allowing a joint prior to be placed over network topologies that fa—
vours, but does not strictly enforce, similarity between networks.
The use of graph kernels in this way opens up a diverse suite of non—
parametric tools for characterizing network similarity within the in—
ference procedure, without the need to employ heuristic models of
evolution as in Zhang and Moret (2010). Finally, a Gaussian process
model is used to capture the dynamics of the time series gene expres—
sion data, conditional on network structure, in the individual spe—
cies, allowing for species—specific embellishments to the GRNs. In
Section 3, we characterize the performance of our methods using
three different graph kernels on a variety of in silico time series data—
sets and demonstrate that the methods are more accurate than
related approaches which do not share information between the

species (Penfold and Wild, 2011; Penfold et (11., 2012). Furthermore,
we demonstrate that the methods are robust to small amounts of
orthologue mislabelling and node duplication. In Section 3.3, we use
these methods to leverage cell cycle networks from the budding yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae into the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces
pombe alongside S.pombe time series gene expression data, and to
jointly infer networks in both S.pombe and S.cerevisiae from time
series gene expression datasets. This approach is able to recapitu—
late known interactions in the S.pombe cell cycle network and
identifies a novel role for Gasl, a 1,3—beta—glucanosyltransferase,
(SPAC19B12.02c) as a major hub in the S.pombe cell cycle. Finally,
in Section 4, we outline the advantages of this approach and discuss
other possible applications and future developments.

2 Leveraging orthologous networks via
Bayesian inference

Here, we outline two Bayesian approaches for the J1 of GRNs in
several species from time series data. In the first framework
(Framework 1, Section 2.1), each species is allowed its own poten—
tially unique GRN, which may be informed by species—specific data,
with an unobserved hypernetwork acting to constrain the individual
GRNs to favour similar structures across the species (Fig. 1a). A
second approach (Framework 2, Section 2.2) directly propagates in—
formation between all datasets via a joint prior distribution over the
individual networks. In this case, the network structure associated
with each species directly inﬂuences the network structure of all
other species without the need of a hypernetwork (Fig. 1b).

2.1 Framework 1: leveraging orthologous networks via
a constraining hypernetwork

Given a set of d datasets collected in d species (for notational simpli—
city, we assume one dataset per species, with a shared indexing, i.e.
dataset i always corresponds to species 1'; this need not be true in gen—
eral and multiple datasets can be collected in a given species), denoted
X : {X(1), . . . ,X(d)} where X“) represents the data in species 1'
(a superscript is used throughout to denote dataset/species index), the
aim is to infer a set of GRNs, one for each of the d species
{9(1), . . . ,g(d)}, where the networks may be similar but not necessar—
ily identical. Here, the ith GRN g“) : (N(i),E(i),l(i)) denotes a dir—
ected graph for species 1' with nodes NU), edges EU) and node labels
[(1), where node labels can be assigned according to the set of ortho—
logues each node has, either based on manually curated lists, or else
through sequence similarity. Within the first model, a hypernetwork,
which must also be inferred, is used to constrain the individual net—
works in the different species, and is denoted 9* : (M ,E*,l*), and
has one node for each of the unique node labels across the d species.

Fig. 1. Combining data from multiple species can be achieved in a number of different ways. One way of doing this is by leveraging data via an unobserved net-
work, referred to here as the ‘hypernetwork'. This is represented conceptually in (a) where each species has its own GRN, represented by the small inset graphs.
These networks are informed by species-specific datasets, represented by the links connecting the microarray to individual species. Additionally, the networks
will be influenced by (and influence in turn) the hypernetwork, represented by the link between the top (dinosaur) species and the two species of birds below. An
alternative approach is represented conceptually in (b). Again each species is represented pictorially, with the species-specific network represented by the small
inset graph. Each species GRN is informed by species-specific data (represented by a link between the microarrays and the species), as well as by the network of
each other species, represented here by a pairwise link between each individual species. Figures modified under Creative Commons license. Adapted from

and Wild, 2011; Penfold et (11., 2012) as outlined in Section 2.4, or
linear regression approaches (Oates et (11., 2014). Other models will be
appropriate when dealing with different types of data such as the use of
Bayesian networks for collections of steady—state gene expression data,
in which case we would additionally require the individual networks be
directed acyclic graphs. A joint prior distribution over network struc—
tures is chosen to correspond to a Gibbs distribution:

where 619(1), . . . ,9“), 9* ) represents an energy function capturing
dissimilarities between networks and ZGK(B) a normalizing constant
arising from the prior distribution over network structures. The par—
ameter B effectively controls the strength of inﬂuence of each of the
individual networks on the hypernetwork and vice versa: for B —> 0,
the model recovers independent fitting to each of the species given
the species—specific data, while very large values of B increasingly fa—
vour similar networks. From the hierarchical structure of the model
in Figure 1a, it is clear that the GRNs are conditionally independent
of one another given the hypernetwork, and the joint prior becomes

Within this framework, each dataset may possess a different value
for B, although here we concentrate on the case B : BU) : Ba) : B“).
In the previous work (Oates et (11., 2014; Penfold et (11., 2012; Werhli
and Husmeier, 2008), network dissimilarity was measured using the
structural Hamming distance between network / and the hypernet—
work, denoted 6190),?) : d(g(i),g*). That is, the energy associated
with two networks is proportional to the distance between them, as
represented by a count of the number of times the edges in the two net—
works disagree. Here, we instead quantify similarity between two
networks using a graph kernel, K(g(j), 9*), which naturally allows us
to capture the similarity between graphs even where duplicate nodes
exist, and can readily quantify more complex similarities in the net—
works that may be missed when using the structural Hamming
distance (see Section 2.3). Because we are now capturing network simi—
larity, rather than dissimilarity, we may take the following:

d
£(g<1),g<d>,g*):£o —ZK(90'>,9*). (4)

[:1
where K(-,  represents a similarity measure between two graphs
and £0 : maxgmﬁwgﬂzlil K(g(j), (7‘ represents the maximal

similarity score possible, and increasing the value of the parameter
B acts to constrain the networks across species to favour increasing
similar structures, if possible. Nevertheless, if the networks are also in—
formed by species—specific time series datasets, this should allow the
model to identify correct network structures even when, for example,
orthologues have been mislabelled, provided enough data exist.
Consequently, this approach should be able to identify common as—
pects, increasing the overall accuracy of network reconstruction, while
still allowing the GRNs to possess species—specific embellishments.

When B and (I) are fixed, J1 proceeds via a series of Gibbs updates
to the parental set of each of the nodes in each of the networks and
hypernetwork in turn (Supplementary Section S1). In some model
organisms, high—throughput yeast one—hybrid or ChIP—Seq experi—
ments have elucidated large sections of the GRNs, and a special case
of J1 exists, in which the known network is fixed, allowing informa—
tion to be leveraged into other species. It is this special case that is
refered to as “NL” (Supplementary Materials Section S11).

2.2 Framework 2: direct leveraging of

orthologous networks

When leveraging network information directly between species as
indicated in Figure 1b, we have the following posterior distribution
over GRNs and model parameters:

where all terms are as previously described. To recap, X0) and 90)
represent the data and network in species j, with (I) denoting hyper—
parmeters in the data model, and B denoting parameters in the joint
prior distribution over networks. Here, the prior distribution over
network structures is again assumed to correspond to a Gibbs distri—
bution [Equation (2)], where the energy is calculated as the pairwise
contribution from all networks:

where 50 : maxg(1)m(jd){ZI‘-1:1 221:7.“ K(g(i),g("))}. From Figure 1b,
it is apparent that the main difference here, compared with the previ—
ous framework, is that the networks are no longer conditionally inde—
pendent of one another given a hypernetwork. That is, each network
directly influences each other network through a joint prior. For

fixed B and (1), J1 can proceed via a series of Gibbs updates of the
parental sets of each node in each species (Supplementary Section
S1), while NL can be approached by fixing the topology of any net—
work, allowing the propagation of information from that species to
all others.

2.3 Network similarity via graph kernels

The models outlined in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 rely on our ability to
evaluate how similar or dissimilar two graphs are. Here, we chose to
do so via graph kernels, which, informally, represent a function of
two graphs that quantifies their similarity (Shervashidze et (11.,
2011). Graph kernels fall broadly into three categories: (i) those
based on similarities of the walks and paths in the respective graphs;
(ii) those based on similarities in limited—sized subgraphs and (iii)
those based on sub—tree patterns. We use an example of each of the
three types of graph kernel, discussed below:

- Shortest path graph kernel: For two graphs 9(1) : (N(1),E(1),l(1))
and 9(2) : (N (2) , Ea), 1(2)), we may ﬁrst calculate the shortest path
graphs 5(1) 2 (N<1>,E§;>,1<1>) and 5(2) 2 (N<2>,E§§),1<2>), with the
shortest path graph kernel deﬁned as:

Kshortest path(g(1)7  Z Z Z kivalk (8(1),e(2)).

wag) Maggy

where kwa1k(-,  represents a positive deﬁnite kernel over walks of
length 1, that is, over edges in the shortest path graphs. 1f edges in
the graphs are unweighted, a Dirac delta function may be used,
that is, we may sum over all edges in the respective networks with
kwalk(e1,e2) : 1 if the edges match and 0 otherwise. Here, for
labelled graphs, edges are considered as matching if they both con—
nect a node with label I with a node with label m. See also
Borgwardt and Kriegel (2005).

Graphlet kernels: The similarity between two graphs may be eval—

uated by ﬁrst decomposing each graph into limited—size graphlets. The
k—spectrum fgu) is deﬁned as the vector containing the count of each
of the different graphlets of size [2 in 9(1). Given a second graph 9(2),
the similarity between the two graphs can be evaluated as follows:

Kg<g<1kg<2>> 2 gm fgm- <7>

When the two graphs vary in size, the counts may be heavily
skewed. Here, the k—spectrum may be normalized to frequency,
Dgu) : fg(1)/Ngm, where N90) is the total number of graphlets
in 9(1). We then have Kg(g(1),g(2)) : ngDga). See also
Supplementary Figure S1 and Shervashidze et al. (2009, 2011).

Weisfeiler—Lehman (WL) kernel: The WL kernel evaluates
the similarity between two graphs by comparing sub—tree
patterns (Shervashidze et (11., 2011). Speciﬁcally, the node in the
respective graph is re—labelled according to which nodes they are

connected to. For example, the nodes in the initial graph, denoted
9(1) : 95,1) : (V, E,l), may be re—labelled according to neighbours
of each node to generate a new graph 93” : (V,E,l1). Here,
the nodes and edges are conserved, but the updated labels con—
tain information about the immediate neighbourhood of each
node. The 17th round of re—labelling generates the graph
95-1) : (V,E,l,-). For an h—step WL kernel, we thus have the se—
quence of graphs {981), . . . £9} and the WL kernel may be eval—
uated as follows:

K$l<g<“.g<2)> 2 WSW?) + ... + k(g),1).g),2)), (8)

where k(-,-) represents a positive deﬁnite base kernel. We use
17 :2 throughout, and an illustrative example for a two—step WL
kernel is included in Supplementary Figure S2.

In general, graphs that are similar will have higher scores
than graphs that are different. Although the three graph kernels
tested in this study were all designed for labelled graphs, this
need not be the case in general, and a significant number of
graph kernels exist for quantifying the similarity or dissimilarity
between unlabelled graphs. The use of labelled graphs within this
context could be considered advantageous, because it allows us
to encode the assumption that orthologues should be regulated by
genes that themselves are orthologous. Here, the assignment of
labels may be done using manually curated lists or BLAST recip—
rocal best hits.

2.4 Gaussian process model for gene expression

Within this article, we will deal exclusively with time series data,
and therefore use the Gaussian process model outlined by Klemm
(2008), which has been shown to outperform many state—of—the—art
approaches on a range of in silica and biological benchmarks
(Hickman et (11., 2013; Penfold and Wild, 2011; Penfold et (11.,
2012). For this model, the dynamics of a gene 1' in species / evolve as
follows:

where x500) denotes the expression level of gene 1' in dataset / at
time t, X0) (t) the expression of all genes in the system at time t, 73a?)
represents the parents of gene 1' in dataset /, 8 represents
some (Gaussian) observational noise (that may be dataset specific)
and f indicates an unknown non—linear function specific to data—
set /. Because of the nature of the model, we may split the data into
an input, X3), and output, yf-j), set of data as follows:

where g0) and n0) represent the number of genes and time series ob—
servation in species /. Here, we assign the unknown function a
Gaussian process prior (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006), denoted
by  ~ gP(H(X(j)(t)),C(XU)(t),X(j)(t/))), and may analytically cal—
culate the probability of observing the output for gene 1', yf-j), condi—
tional on the parental set 73a?) and observations X3):

Under a Gaussian noise model, this integral is analytically tract—

tional form of the covariance function was chosen to be the
squared exponential and the hyperparameters (bf-j) : {6311-7621719}
represent the standard deviation of the observation noise, stand—

where 735(7) denotes the truncated power set of putative regulators/

imum number of genes that can regulate another simultaneously, no
such limits exist in the networks derived from the marginal probabil—
ities for regulation, which can be calculated from the full joint distri—
bution. Finally, the hyperparameters may be estimated by
maximizing

Within this framework, the probability for each parental set may
therefore be pre—computed for each of the individual species, along—
side an estimation of (bf-j), which may be substituted directly into
Equations (1) and (5).

3 Results

In Sections 3.1 and 3.2, we characterize the performance of the
Orthologous Causal Structure Identification (OCSI) algorithm on in
silico benchmarks for which there are known gold standards and
compare with the Causal Structure Identification (CS1) algorithm
(Penfold and Wild, 2011). In Section 3.3, we use OCSI to leverage
cell cycle networks from S.cerevisiae into S.pombe, and also perform
JI in both species.

3.1 In silico networks with 1:1 mapping of nodes

The OCSI algorithm was initially tested using dataset 5 from the
DREAM4 10—gene network challenge. This dataset consist of five
time series generated under five different conditions from an identi—
cal network. Because these networks are identical, this benchmark
does not test inference in multiple species with duplicate nodes (it
should be noted, however, that the dynamics in each of the five time
series are perturbed, and this situation might therefore reﬂect infer—
ence using closely related species in which the underlying network
has been conserved). Nonetheless, this benchmark is an important
case that establishes any initial advantages that might exist, com—
pared with stand—alone inference, and allows us to gauge how differ—
ent graph kernels behave within the context of network inference. In
general, the use of hierarchical modelling allows more accurate re—
construction of networks than standalone inference (Bourque and
Sankoff, 2004; Oates et (11., 2014; Penfold et (11., 2012; Wang et (11.,
2006), and the same appears to be true for OCSI, with the WL ker—
nel performing better than the other graph kernels tested.
Furthermore, the hierarchical model/Framework 1 appeared to be
more stable when many datasets were used, with the non—hierarch—
ical model/Framework 2 more stable when fewer datasets were con—
sidered. Full details about initial benchmarking are included in
Supplementary Section S2.

3.2 In silico networks with duplicate nodes
A second set of in silico data was used to benchmark the perform—
ance of OCSI, this time on networks that contain duplicate nodes.

These datasets represented five species that are related as shown in
Figure 2a. A core network in species A was modelled based on the
repressilator (Elowitz and Leibler, 2000); a second species B has an
identical network structure as species A, but the dynamics have been
perturbed. Duplication of the repressilator network of species A re—
sulted in an intermediate species I, which is not observed.
Subsequent loss of nodes, loss of connections and a perturbation of
dynamics in species 1 resulted in species C. Species D also derives
from species 1 via loss of edges, and finally species E is derived from
species D via a perturbation of the dynamics. For each species, a
time series of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was generated
consisting of 21 time points, as shown in Figure 2b. Full details of
the models, including information about data generation, can be
found in Supplementary Section S3. Benchmarking of the OCSI al—
gorithm was undertaken as follows: (i) a five species case, in which
mRNA time series are observed for species A through E inclusive
(species I is not observed); (ii) a two species case, in which mRNA
time series are observed for species C and D and (iii) a two species
case in which the network in either species A or C is known and
fixed, and inference of the network of species D is undertaken by
jointly leveraging the network of species A/C alongside time series
mRNA expression data of species E. For the five species case, the
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the
various species is shown for the WL graph kernel in Figure 2c—e,
where dashed (red) lines indicate the AUC under stand—alone infer—
ence, and solid (blue) lines indicate AUC as a function of B for the
two OCSI frameworks outlined in this article. The top row indicates
performance when network information is directly leveraged
(Framework 2), while the bottom row indicates performance when
information is leveraged via a hypernetwork (Framework 1).
The average AUC over all 5 species as a function of B is shown in
Figure 2d, while the marginal likelihood at various values of B is
shown in Figure 2e. When B is small, accuracy of OCSI corresponds
to that found using stand—alone inference, as expected. For inter—
mediate values of B (over the range tested), OCSI improves the ac—
curacy of reconstructed networks, particularly in species B, C and E,
where AUC has increased from [0.78, 0.59, 0.79] in the stand—alone
inference to [1, 0.95, 0.97] in Framework 1 and [1, 0.95, 0.96] in
Framework 2. For species D, reconstruction from the time series
data is already nearly perfect (AUC : 0.86), but nonetheless some
increase in AUC is observed, with a value of 0.89 in Framework 1
and 0.91 in Framework 2. For species A, in which the network has
been reconstructed from time series data with AUC : 1, the per—
formance of OCSI at intermediate values of B remains 1, indicating
that there is no degradation in network reconstruction in species for
which the data are highly informative. As B increases further, per—
formance begins to degrade, both in terms of accuracy as measured
by the AUC, and in terms of increased variance in the estimated
AUC of multiple Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) runs. A
similar trend is seen for the average AUC as a function of B, that is,
the AUC averaged over all five species shows initially increases from
0.79 to 0.95 in both frameworks before degrading at higher values
of B. For Framework 1, in which information is propagated via an
hypernetwork, the peak performance occurs at approximately B : 3,
while for Framework 2, in which information is directly propagated
between species, peak performance occurs at approximately B: 1.
In this case, Framework 1 appears to be more stable than
Framework 2, that is, the range of B over which the algorithm yields
improved AUC compared with standalone inference is greater, sug—
gesting that, in cases where the normalizing constant cannot be com—
puted and B must be set arbitrarily, Framework 1 may be more
useful. In our example, we were able to estimate the marginal

likelihood (Supplementary Section $13), which is indicated in
Figure 2e. Here, the value of B that corresponds to the greatest mar—
ginal likelihood corresponds well to the region in which the AUC is
highest. Performance of the graphlet kernel and shortest path graph
kernels did not appear to be considerably better than standalone in—
ference over the range of B tested (data not shown).

For the two species case, the AUC is shown in Supplementary
Figure S7b—d. Here, networks were reconstructed using species C
and D. As with the five species case, the AUC for small values of B
corresponded well to standalone inference in both frameworks. For
species C, as B increased, the AUC increased from 0.59 in the stand—
alone inference to 0.96 in Framework 1 and 0.98 in Framework 2.
Because species D already had good reconstruction accuracy from
the time series data alone, further improvements may not have been
expected. Nonetheless, a small increase in AUC was seen, rising
from 0.86 in the standalone inference to 0.89 in Framework 1 and
0.88 in Framework 2. Overall, the average AUC rose from 0.72 in
standalone inferences to 0.91 and 0.92 in Frameworks 1 and 2, re—
spectively (Supplementary Figure S7c). As with the five dataset case,
if B was increased too much the accuracy of the algorithms began to
diminish, with AUC falling and increasingly varied, suggesting that
for high values of B exploration of the parameter space may be diffi—
cult, with chains becoming stuck in suboptimal modes. For the two
dataset case, Framework 2 appeared to be more stable than

Framework 1, that is, the range over B in which the performance
is greater than standalone was larger in Framework 2 than it
was in Framework 1. Estimation of the marginal likelihood
(Supplementary Figure S7d) suggests that the region in which the
marginal likelihood was greatest corresponds well to the values of B
for which the AUC was highest. Performance of the graphlet kernel
and shortest path graph kernels did not appear to be considerably
better than standalone inference over the range of B tested (data not
shown).

Finally, OCSI was used to jointly leverage network information
from one species, alongside time series gene expression data from
another. Here, we used two examples, in the first instance the net—
work in species A was assumed to be known, and was thus fixed,
and leveraged into species E, alongside time series data for species
E. In the second example, the network C was assumed to be known,
and was thus fixed and leveraged into species E. The performance in
terms of reconstruction of the network in species E when the net—
work in A was fixed is shown as a function of B in Supplementary
Figure S8, with the accuracy in the reconstruction of network
E when species C’s GRN is fixed as shown in Supplementary Figure
S9. In both cases, the accuracy of network reconstruction in species
E (in terms of AUC) increased from 0.71 in the standalone inference
to [0.96, 0.97] in Framework 1 and Framework 2, respectively,
when GRN of species A is fixed, and to 0.96 in both frameworks

when the GRN of species C was fixed. In all cases, the AUC was op—
timal or near optimal when the marginal likelihood was greatest.
However, inference in the non—hierarchical framework appeared to
be more stable over a greater range of B than the hierarchical ver—
sion, suggesting that when normalizing constant could not be esti—
mated, direct leveraging of networks from model organisms to more
relevant ones is best approached with Framework 2.

3.3 Leveraging cell cycle networks in yeast

We have applied OCSI to infer cell cycle networks in S.pombe, for
which the GRN is less well characterized than S.cerevisiae. Here, we
use OCSI Framework 2 to perform three types of inference: (i) in the
first instance, the GRN of S.cerevisiae was directly propagated to
S.pombe utilizing graph kernels, that is, without utilizing any time
series data, effectively representing samples from the prior distribu—
tion; (ii) in the second instance, the S.cerevisiae network was utilized
alongside S.pombe time series to infer an S.pombe cell cycle net—
work, that is, an NL task and (iii) in the third instance, time series
from both species were used to perform J1, with the S.cerevisiae net—
work used as a prior. This inference is represented graphically in
Supplementary Figure S10. Genes and regulatory connections
involved in the S.cerevisiae cell cycle were identified from Li et al.
(2004) and used to construct a fixed S.cerevisiae network, with
genes involved in the S.pombe cell cycle identified from Bushel et al.
(2009). Additional genes were introduced into both lists based on
the manually curated orthologue list of PombBase (Wood et (11.,
2012). In total, 157 genes were identified for S.cerevisiae with 165
connections between them and 100 genes for S.pombe. These genes
included 17 duplicated genes, 7 S.cerevisiae—specific nodes and
53 S.pombe—specific nodes (full lists of genes can be found for
S.cerevisiae and S.pombe in Supplementary Files S1 and S2, respect—
ively). The S.pombe transcriptional time series data were taken from
Rustici et al. (2004) and S.cerevisiae time series taken from Cho
et al. (1998), Spellman et al. (1998), Pramila et al. (2006) and
Granovskaia et al. (2010).

Approximately 60% of the top 100 connections were common
between the J1 and NL approaches, with around 50% of the top
1000 connections in common, suggesting broad agreement between
the two approaches. Although literature connections for S.pombe
are less well documented than for S.cerevisiae, some known connec—
tions were found using BioGRID (Stark et (11., 2006), while pre—
dicted S. pombe protein interactions could be found in Pancaldi et al.
(2012), and were used to evaluate preliminary performance of all
three runs (Supplementary Table S1). In general, the agreement be—
tween inferred networks and available literature was relatively low
(~2 — 12% represented true positives), reﬂecting the fact that less is
known about the S.pombe cell cycle network than the S.cerevisiae
network. Indeed, the ground truth connections used here may not
represent casual or direct interactions that we are attempting to infer
here, and any lack of agreement should therefore be interpreted with
caution. Nonetheless, the J1 of networks and NL approaches yielded
greater agreement than expected by chance, and additionally ap—
peared to have greater agreement with the literature than when we
directly leverage the S.cerevisiae network into S.pombe using graph
kernels without using additional time series data.

OCSI was able to capture several important regulatory links
among the S.pombe cell cycle genes. In S.pombe, the MCB—binding
factor transcription complex (where MCB is Mlu1 Cell cycle Box),
which contains the Cdc10, Res1 and Res2 proteins, is responsible
for the cell cycle—regulated transcription of many genes during G1
phase of the cell cycle (Bertoli et (11., 2013). Genes that are regulated

work inferred using OCSI (Framework 2). This network was able to recapitulate
known aspects of the S.pombe cell cycle network including relationships
among Res1 (SPBC725.16), ResZ (SPAC22F3.09c), Cdc10 (SPBC336.120), Yox1
(SPBC21B10.13c), TosA (SPAP14E8.02) and Mrc1 (SPAC694.060), and predicts a
novel role for Gas1 (SPAC19812.020) as a key regulator of Yox1,
TosA(SPAP14E8.02), Mrc1, CigZ (SPAPBZBA.03), Cdt1(SPBC428.18), Cdt2
(SPBC11B10.09) and Msh6 (SPCC285.160), among others. Here, we also indicate

by the MBF complex include G1 cyclins (Cig2), proteins required
for loading the mini—chromosome maintenance helicase to DNA rep—
lication origins (Cdc18 and Cdt1) and cell cycle—regulated transcrip—
tion factors (Yox1 and Tos4). Our data recapitulate many of the
known interactions and dependencies identified previously by others
(full networks available in Supplementary Files S4—S6). In addition,
both J1 and NL identify Gas1 as a cell cycle—regulated gene involved
in the transcription of MBF—regulated genes, including Mrc1, Cdt2,
Rad21, Msh6 (Figure 3), as well as a variety of other genes, repre—
senting one of the most highly connected hubs. Gas1 is a 1,3—beta—
glucanosyltransferase that elongates and rearranges 1,3—beta—glucan
side chains, which are cross—linked with 1,6—beta—glucan, chitin and
proteins to form the main layer of the cell wall (Mouyna et (11.,
2000; Ragni et (11., 2007). In budding yeast, cells lacking Gas1 have
weakened and abnormal cell walls and are sensitive to cell wall—
perturbing drugs. Recently, however, a surprising new role for Gas1
activity has been identified in the regulation of transcriptional silenc—
ing at rDNA loci (Eustice and Pillus, 2014; Ha et (11., 2014; Koch
and Pillus, 2009). In particular, it has been suggested that Gas1
physically interacts with Sir2, an nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD)+—dependent histone deacetylase that is a subunit of the
rDNA silencing complex (RENT: regulator of nucleolar silencing
and telophase exit), to repress Pol II—dependent transcription at the
rDNA locus (Huang and Moazed, 2003). The observations that in
budding yeast a pool of Gas1 both localizes to the nuclear periphery
(Huh et (11., 2003) and interacts with other diverse components of
the chromatin modifying machinery (www.thebiogrid.org) support
a role for Gas1 in transcriptional regulation. One possibility is that
Gas1 may interact physically with the MBF complex to mediate cell
cycle—regulated transcription of MBF—regulated genes or a subset of
those genes that are involved in cell wall biogenesis in fission yeast.
Further experiments will be needed to test this possibility.

4 Discussion

Deciphering complex biological networks and elucidating how those
networks inﬂuence emergent properties increasingly rely on piecing
together many diverse sets of experimental data. The ability to lever—
age data from several related species is particularly desirable, and
would allow the vast amount of information obtained in model

organisms to be translated into more medically or economically rele—
vant ones. Possible applications include the joint learning of GRNs
associated with disease progression in mice and humans, or the dir—
ect leveraging of networks associated with seed yield, seed quality,
stress tolerance or resistance that have been constructed in the model
plant Arabidopsis into crops. Despite the underlying similarities in
the GRNs of closely related species, however, significant evolution—
ary differences may still exist that can confound standard
approaches to inferring GRNs from large—scale transcriptomics
data. Here, we have developed two Bayesian approaches to network
inference that allow for such leveraging of interspecies data. These
models perform better than a related approach on in silico bench—
marks, and are robust to small amounts of orthologue mislabelling
and to gene duplication. We have also successfully used them to le—
verage information about the S.cerevisiae cell cycle network into
S.pombe, and also performed J1 between S.cerevisiae and S.pombe.
Our analysis of the networks in S.pombe showed some agreement
with the literature, although the true positive rate was relatively
low, perhaps reﬂecting that the ‘gold standard’ networks we used
did not necessarily contain many direct interactions. Nonetheless,
our method identified a number of known key cell cycle interactions
and predicted a novel role for Gas1 (SPAC19B12.02c) in cell cycle
activities.

The methods outlined here share many of the same principles as
earlier works (Zhang and Moret, 2010). Our methods, however,
rely on graph kernels to capture the similarity between labelled
graphs, rather than explicit evolutionary models. Broadly speaking,
the labelling procedure requires that nodes to be assigned to groups,
which can be informed by manually curated lists of orthologues, or
on the basis of sequence similarity (Kashima et al., 2009). Because
the networks are additionally informed by time series data, the
method is robust to some mislabelling of nodes, although more
adaptive procedures can be envisaged in which node labels are as—
signed, or refined, within the inference procedure (Gholami and
Fellenberg, 2010). In general, there is no explicit requirement to use
labelled graph kernels, although doing so represents an effective
way of encoding biological expectations that orthologues function
similarly between species. Graph kernels for unlabelled graphs do
exist, and could be used within OCSI, which would favour similar
structures between the networks as a whole, without placing any im—
plicit restraints on where a given node belongs with respect to the
others: that is, the joint prior in the method would favour similar
network properties rather than similar biological positioning. One
possible future line of work could focus on combining labelled and
unlabelled graph kernels for situations in which only smaller sets of
orthologues can be identified. The diversity of graph kernels, how—
ever, may be problematic, as it is not immediately clear which graph
kernels yield the best results for a given situation. Here, we have
used three different graph kernels, with the WL kernel appearing to
offer better performance than the graphlet and shortest path kernels
overall. It is not currently clear why this might be, although one pos—
sibility is that the graphlet and shortest path kernels are not suited
to the small or densely connected networks we used for benchmark—
ing. Alternatively, the choice of B for the shortest path and graphlet
kernels may be inappropriate. Future approaches might therefore
look to address how to tune B automatically within the algorithm as
in Penfold et al. (2012). It has been noted, however, that at high val—
ues of B, the MCMC procedure, that is, a Gibbs update of the paren—
tal set of each node in turn, begins to fail due to the high modality in
the parameter space. To develop approaches that can tune B, more
advanced MCMC algorithms will be needed (Calderhead and
Girolami, 2009). Alternatively, another promising approach would

be to automatically combine multiple graph kernels together allow—
ing for increased ﬂexibility in characterizing network similarity, al—
beit at additional computational costs.

Finally, as well as the ﬂexibility conferred on the inference
process by using graph kernels, our approach allows the possibility
of exploiting other properties of graph kernels. Because the
graph kernels we have used are positive semi—definite, this will allow
algorithms that not only jointly infer networks over species, but also
tie those networks to phenotypic observations via a separate
Gaussian process model utilizing the graph kernels as a covariance
function.

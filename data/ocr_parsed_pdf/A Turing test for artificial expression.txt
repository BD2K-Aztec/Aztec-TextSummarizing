ABSTRACT

Motivation: The lack of reliable, comprehensive gold standards com-
plicates the development of many bioinformatics tools, particularly for
the analysis of expression data and biological networks. Simulation
approaches can provide provisional gold standards, such as regula-
tory networks, for the assessment of network inference methods.
However, this just defers the problem, as it is difficult to assess how
closely simulators emulate the properties of real data.

Results: In analogy to Turing’s test discriminating humans and com-
puters based on responses to questions, we systematically compare
real and artiﬁcial systems based on their gene expression output.
Different expression data analysis techniques such as clustering
are applied to both types of datasets. We define and extract distribu-
tions of properties from the results, for instance, distributions of cluster
quality measures or transcription factor activity patterns. Distributions
of properties are represented as histograms to enable the comparison
of artificial and real datasets. We examine three frequently used simu-
lators that generate expression data from parameterized regulatory
networks. We identify features distinguishing real from artificial data-
sets that suggest how simulators could be adapted to better emulate
real datasets and, thus, become more suitable for the evaluation of
data analysis tools.

1 INTRODUCTION

The analysis of expression data involves a range of bioinformatics
tools. They are used for outlier removal and normalization
(Fundel et al., 2008), for clustering (Eisen et al., 1998), for finding
relevant biological processes (Draghici et al., 2003; Naeem et al.,
2012) as well as for the inference and modeling of gene regulatory
interactions (GRIs) (Kiiffner et al., 2010, 2012). The improvement
of such tools frequently depends on insights into properties of
transcriptional regulation. To better understand such properties
and to facilitate further tool development, several simulators have
been developed for various areas of expression analysis.
Another reason for conducting simulation studies is to provide
gold standards that are not available for real data. In case of

clustering, the number of gene clusters and the clusterigene as-
sociations are usually not known for real data but can be deﬁned
easily within an in silico framework (Wu et al., 2004; Yeung
et al., 2001). For the assessment of tools, it is important that
simulators generate realistic expression patterns.

Similar techniques are applied to analyze whether gene sets
associated with biological processes exhibit a signiﬁcant enrich-
ment of differential expression. The assessment of enrichment
tests on real data is difﬁcult, as the genes or processes that exhibit
differential activity between experimental conditions are usually
not known before the actual experiment (Naeem et al., 2012).
As a remedy, enrichment tests can be assessed based on simula-
tions of gene sets and their differential expression patterns
(Ackermann and Strimmer, 2009; Efron and Tibshirani, 2007;
Nam and Kim, 2008).

Furthermore, Albers et a]. (2006) generated realistic data and
noise distributions to examine data normalization approaches for
two-dye arrays. Simulators are also used to examine speciﬁc the-
oretical assumptions [e.g. expression data distributions (Parrish
et al., 2009), single-cell data (Hebenstreit and Teichmann, 2011)
and theoretical properties of GRIs (Wu and Chan, 2012)].

Simulators devised for studying GRI inference approaches
are again motivated by the need for complete gold standard net-
works. Unlike the speciﬁc simulators, network simulators claim
to more generally satisfy the mentioned requirements. They imi-
tate experimentally determined GRIs and their dynamical proper-
ties and emulate other properties of real data such as data and
noise distributions (Haynes and Brent, 2009; Pinna et al., 2011;
Schaffter et al., 2011; Van den Bulcke et al., 2006).

Network simulators have been applied successfully to assess
algorithms that reconstruct GRIs from expression data, e. g. Via
community-wide blind assessments (Marbach et al., 2012; Pinna
et al., 2011). Therefore, simulators implement elaborate experi-
mental settings, for instance, by dealing with biological and tech-
nical replicates and by generating data for gene knockouts,
various perturbations and time series data (Schaffter et al.,
2011). Some simulators also take into account sequence vari-
ations in promoter regions and coding sequences (Pinna et al.,
2011). Instead of random topologies, many simulators use real-
istic topologies, such as scale-free networks (Haynes and Brent,
2009) or networks of experimentally determined GRIs (Schaffter
et al., 2011; Van den Bulcke et al., 2006).

Algorithms can be benchmarked using simulators in a mean-
ingful way if generated, and real data are sufﬁciently similar
(Haynes and Brent, 2009; Pinna et al., 2011; Schaffter et al.,
2011; Van den Bulcke et al., 2006). As this is difﬁcult to show,
in silico models are sometimes considered insufﬁcient evidence
for method enhancements. This is owing to our lack of a good
understanding of the distribution of expression levels across the

various biological states and the correlation between biological
replicates (Rocke et al., 2009).

The present study evaluates to which extent current state-of-
the-art simulators are able to generate realistic datasets and gold
standards. We propose characteristic histograms to compare arti-
ﬁcial and real expression compendia. The histograms are derived
by applying a range of expression data analysis approaches. We
provide data on our Web site and R software to apply the sug-
gested analyses on the compendia examined in this article or
deﬁned by the user. The properties of real and artiﬁcial datasets
thus become amenable to a mutual pairwise comparison. For the
generation of artiﬁcial datasets, we focus on network simulators,
as they are most frequently used in practice and most general in
their scope.

2 DATASETS

To compare real and artiﬁcial expression compendia, we
obtained a range of datasets. This section brieﬂy describes the
real datasets and experimentally derived networks (see the cited
original publications for more information). Artificial datasets
and networks are described in the Methods section.

2.1 Expression data

Four microarray compendia with several hundred microarray
measurements were obtained for Escherichia coli and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae from the M3D Database (Faith et al.,
2008) (denoted with index 1) and from the DREAMS competition
(Marbach et al., 2012) (denoted with index 2). Measurements as
well as annotations derived from these sources are already ren-
dered comparable across different experiments and are thus suited
to automated analyses. Besides wild-type measurements, experi-
mental conditions represent (combinations of) drug, environmen-
tal and gene perturbations. Some of the drug or environmental
perturbations are provided as time course measurements.
We considered each time point as a separate condition. Each
condition may contain multiple replicates. Before all analyses,
we log2-transformed the measurements. Each dataset is repre-
sented as an expression matrix M, where rows correspond to
the genes and columns to the measurements, i.e. the element
mm- of this matrix is the jth measurement of the ith gene.

2.2 Gene regulatory networks

The topology of E.coli gene regulatory networks was taken from
RegulonDB (Gama-Castro et al., 201 1). RegulonDB is a database
of gene regulatory relationships that are both experimentally vali-
dated and manually curated. The S .cerevisiae network was derived
by large-scale Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation (ChIP) assays
post-processed by MacIsaac et a]. (2006). These large-scale net-
works cover only transcription factoritarget gene (TFzTG) inter-
actions and ignore other kinds of interactions, e. g. based on
microRNAitarget interactions.

3 METHODS

3.1 Simulators and their areas of application

GeneNetWeaver (GNW) (Schaffter et al., 2011) generates mRNA read-
outs by simulation of transcription and translation via stochastic

differential equations that are randomly parameterized to construct exe-
cutable models. Additionally, measurement noise is added to the gene
expression data after simulation. Regulation takes place at the transcrip-
tional level only, i.e. other layers of regulation such as proteiniprotein
interactions, metabolites or cellular states are not considered. Instead of
random graphs, GNW uses the known biological GRI networks, e.g.
from E.coli and S.cerevisiae, but removes auto-regulatory loops. GNW
data do not vary over several orders of magnitude and, thus, correspond
to log-transformed real data.

Three levels of experiments are supported where the variability of
simulated expression runs increases from level one to three. Technical
replicates as the ﬁrst level are based on the same model and parameter-
ization; the generated data are distinguished by noise only. The second
level models biological replicates by slight random increases or decreases
of the basal levels of all genes. Finally, distinct conditions are applied to
the simulation mimicking time course, (multi or single) gene deletion or
gene overexpression experiments. This dataset was speciﬁcally designed
to mimic the types of experiments performed in the DREAMS E.coli
dataset (Marbach et al., 2012), which is comprehensively described
(http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/dream/index.php?title=DSc4). The
GNW dataset consists of 1643 genes, 195 of which are transcription fac-
tors, and 805 microarray experiments.

Gene REgulatory Network Decoding Evaluations tooL (GRENDEL;
Haynes and Brent, 2009), in contrast to GNW, does not directly derive
the topology of the simulated gene regulatory networks from real net-
works. Instead, a topology is modeled that reproduces in- and out-degree
distributions of real networks.

Each simulated gene is paired with an S.cerevisiae gene to use experi-
mental data, such as translation rate, protein decay rate, mRNA decay
rate and mRNA transcription rate for the parameterization of a determin-
istic ordinary differential equation (ODE) simulation. However, topology
modeling does not guarantee that paired genes in the yeast network are
similarly close in the modeled network. Owing to the lack of suitable data,
parameters determining the dynamical properties of GRIs are chosen ran-
domly. Genes may not only be regulated by transcription factors, but also
by environmental signals that can have instantaneous effects on other
genes. Measurement noise is added to the data according to a log-
normal distribution. Thus, only technical replicates and experimental con-
ditions are modeled, and biological replicates are not taken into account.

Expression data were simulated for 100 genes across 300 measure-
ments. This population was modeled by varying the efﬁciency of tran-
scription and mRNA degradation across samples independently for each
gene. The topology of the network is described by an exponential distri-
bution for in-degrees and a power-law distribution for out-degrees and
was ﬁt to reﬂect the degree distributions of the transcriptional network in
S.cerevisiae. GRENDEL uses the Systems Biology Markup Language
ODE Solver library to deterministically integrate the ODEs that deﬁne
the dynamical system. To the resulting expression data, simulated experi-
mental noise is then added according to a log-normal distribution.

SynTReN. The network topology of a simulation with SynTReN (Van
den Bulcke et al., 2006) is constructed from subsets of the known gene
regulatory networks from E.coli and S.cerevisiae, which is similar to
GNW’s approach. The differential equations used for the simulation
are based on MichaelisiMenten and Hill kinetic equations and allow
us to simulate independent as well as synergistic interactions. Although
pre-generated datasets were used in case of GNW (Marbach et al., 2012)
and GRENDEL (Haynes and Brent, 2009), we modeled a network of 300
genes with SynTReN and generated an expression compendium of 200
measurements using default parameters.

3.2 General approach to dataset assessment

We suggest a procedure for the extraction of individual dataset properties
and their comparison across datasets that consists of four steps. We

(1) apply standard expression data analysis techniques,

(2) analyze the results to generate speciﬁc distributions,
(3) visualize the distributions by histograms and, ﬁnally,

(4) compare different datasets based on histogram overlaps.

Steps 1 and 2 depend on the details of the individual analyses (see next
section), while steps 3 and 4 are the same across analyses.

In step 3, we plot histograms from analysis-speciﬁc distributions. For
each type of histogram, we manually picked the smallest number of histo-
gram bins (between 20 and 100, this can be changed in the R-package)
that appropriately displayed histograms for a property. Histograms are
computed by equally distributing the bins between the lowest and highest
values of the compared histograms. Unless noted otherwise, we plot
normalized densities in the histograms where the bars receive an average
density of 1. Although graphical representations enable the closer exam-
ination of histograms, the largest differences are identiﬁed via overlap
scores.

For each property (step 4), we calculate overlaps to compare pairs of
histograms a and b by dividing the minimum density by the maximum
density over n bins: overlap = i min(a,—, b,)/ i max(a,—, bi).

3.3 Characterization of dataset properties

For the comparison of datasets, we characterize various properties by
speciﬁc histograms derived from quality measures and standard gene ex-
pression analyses (Fig. 1).

Replicate noise histogram. Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient p is com-
puted for all pairs of replicate measurements contained in a given expres-
sion compendium. For example, if a measurement is repeated four times,
six pairwise correlations are computed. Correlations of all pairs of repli-
cated measurements are combined into one histogram visualizing pairs of
replicates which exhibit given intervals of p.

Intensity histogram. For this analysis, all intensity measurements from
a given expression compendium are combined into one histogram visua-
lizing measurements with particular expression intensities. Such histo-
grams are important to evaluate how effective approaches for data
normalization are.

Range of gene expression. The expression range of individual genes is
estimated from the difference between its 5% and 95% intensity quantiles
observed in a given expression compendium. A corresponding histogram
is created to show the histogram of gene ranges. Although a fold change
of two is considered a substantial change in case of the real data, no such

intuition exists in case of the artiﬁcial data that are scaled very differently.
Therefore, we multiply the artiﬁcial ranges by a factor so that their
median corresponds to the median of the compared real range histogram.

Silhouette coefﬁcient (two histograms). To evaluate cluster quality, we
use hierarchical average linkage clustering (Evisen et al., 1998), using
Pearson’s p as the similarity measure. Clustering is performed separately
for genes (using the corresponding expression matrix M) and microarrays
(based on the transposed matrix MT). The quality of the clustering at
each of the successive node (i.e. gene or microarray) join steps is evaluated
by Silhouette coefﬁcients (Rousseeuw, 1987) that compare the average
within-cluster distances with the average between-cluster distance. Thus,
this coefﬁcient evaluates the tightness and separation of clusters. For a
dendrogram consisting of n nodes, 11 7 1 Silhouette values are obtained.
Hierarchical clustering illustrates properties of co-regulation in expression
data, i.e. the emergence of gene expression patterns across different
experimental conditions.

TF and TG correlation (two histograms). To examine the correlation
between TFs and regulated TGs, we generate three histograms.
Correlation coefﬁcients p are calculated for (i) all pairs of genes, (ii) all
pairs of a TF and an annotated target as well as (iii) all pairs of targets
that are regulated by the same set of TFs. Histogram (i) thus represents
the background distribution of correlations between arbitrary pairs of
genes. Finally, two difference diagrams are generated to show the enrich-
ment of TFiTG correlations as the difference between (ii) and (i) and the
enrichment of TGiTG correlations as the difference between (iii) and (i).
The resulting difference diagrams depict to what extent highly correlated
pairs are enriched (positive values) or depleted (negative values) for true
TFiTG or TGiTG relationships. TFiTG correlations thus enable us to
evaluate whether statistical dependencies exist between the expression
levels of TFs and their targets (Marbach et al., 2012; Wu and Chan,
2012). Alternatively, TGiTG correlations estimate the degree of co-regu-
lation induced in pairs of genes regulated by the same TFs.

TF activity histogram. We determine the activity of TFs based on the
expression proﬁles of their sets of TGs in the available GRI gold stand-
ard. Wilcoxon’s nonparametric rank-sum method (WR test) (Mann and
Whitney, 1947) is applied to test whether TF targets exhibit signiﬁcant
rank differences in comparison with other (non-targets) genes (Naeem
et al., 2012). The ranks are derived by sorting the genes based
on their z-transformed absolute expression, i.e. for each condition i, the
expression level l,-(g) of gene g is transformed into a z-score 2,-(g) via
2,-(g) = (l,-(g) — m(g))/s(g) where m(g) and s(g) denote the mean
and standard deviation of the expression levels of g, respectively. After

three in silica expression compendia. For each type of analysis, ﬁgures in this article use in silica data of a different simulator. Additional analyses were
performed across all simulators (see Web site and R software for more figures), and corresponding results are shown in the heatmap on the right. In the
heatmap, different analyses (rows) compare various pairs of datasets (columns; E.c. =E.cali; S.c. =S.cerevisiae) based on histogram overlaps. The
heatmap depicts the extent to which dataset properties are shared across compendia. Overlaps are shown in units of row-wise standard deviation (see

this transformation, particularly high or low levels of a given gene can
be clearly distinguished from its average levels. The WR test results in
P values that we correct via BenjaminieHochberg’s (Benjamini and
Yekutieli, 2001) procedure for multiple testing. Regulators are called
active if they receive a corrected P< 0.05 (Naeem et al., 2012). For a
given expression compendium, one histogram is constructed to show
how many TFs are found active in particular subsets of the measurements.

4 RESULTS

We compare various properties between real and artiﬁcial data-
sets and find strong deviations (Fig. l, heatmap). Properties and
their deviations are discussed below in detail. Each subsection
presents one type of property histogram and is exempliﬁed in
detail based on the data from one of the three simulators (Fig. 1).
Results on the other simulators are brieﬂy summarized at the end
of each section (see availability for additional ﬁgures).

4.1 Simple data histograms (GNW)

Replicate noise histogram. We ﬁrst examined the reproducibility
of measurements Via Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient ,0 (Fig. 2a).
In case of artiﬁcial data, variations between replicates are due to
the noise that simulators add to the generated expression data. In
comparison with the real data where most replicates exhibit a
very high ,0, replicate measurements in artiﬁcial data are substan-
tially less correlated, which is due to excess amounts of added
noise. In addition, real data usually include a number of outliers
that show substantially lower correlations than the main distri-
bution of replicate correlations. In contrast, no outliers
were observed in case of artiﬁcial data where the peaks of the
distributions were sharply bounded (see scatter plots as inset
panels of Fig. 2a).

Intensity histogram. Although measured intensity histograms
generally depend on the used microarray platform (arrays used
in this study were performed on Affymetrix platforms), intensi-
ties usually exhibit positive values that are approximately nor-
mally distributed (Fig. 2b). In contrast, the simulated data
histograms we examined were not normally distributed and

peaked at an absolute expression level of 0. In addition, histo-
grams derived from individual real microarrays show a much
greater diversity as shown in Figure 2b.

Range of gene expression. In contrast to the overall histogram
of expression intensities (Fig. 2b), Figure 2c Visualizes the range
of fold changes of genes. For instance, a value of 3 denotes the
genes that exhibit fold changes of up to 8 between their 5% and
95% quantiles. While the distributions were sharply bounded in
case of artificial data (with a peak at a fold range of 2), the real
data exhibited a distribution with a long tail of genes covering a
much broader spectrum of fold ranges.

Figure 2c further enables the estimation of the number of dis-
crete expression levels or activity states assumed by individual
genes. This is important for modeling approaches such as
Bayesian (Needham et al., 2006) or fuzzy logic models (Kiiffner
et al., 2010) requiring discretized values. A log; fold range of 2 will
correspond to three distinguishable gene levels if discrete sets are
separated by a log fold change of 1. As demonstrated by Kiiffner
et al. (2010), a gene model with three states is indeed sufﬁcient to
model all genes in the GNW dataset. However, in case of real data,
the majority of genes could be suitably modeled with only two
states (corresponding to the peak at 1 in Fig. 2c), while many genes
require a larger number of states. A substantial number of genes
showed fold ranges of >4.5 (132 of 4511 genes in E.cali) that
accordingly exhibit 36 states.

Deviational patterns described here for GNW also apply to
GRENDEL. On the other hand, a closer examination of the
histograms (see availability for corresponding plots) reveals
that data generated by SynTReN actually resemble real data
histograms in case of the intensity and gene range properties.
However, SynTReN’s replicate noise distribution is extremely
broad and thus resembles neither the real data nor the data
generated by other simulators.

Fig. 3. Analysis of cluster quality. We grouped (a) genes and (b) microarrays by hierarchical clustering to examine the cluster quality via silhouette
coefﬁcients across all possible clusters. Cluster quality is consistently higher in real (here: E.cali, outline) than in artiﬁcial data (here: GRENDEL, ﬁlled).
Individual gene clusters and corresponding gene proﬁles (see dendrogram for gene symbols matching the line color) are shown for two clusters that
exhibit the highest silhouette coefﬁcients, i.e. (c) for genes that code for ribosomal proteins in E.cali and (d) for artiﬁcial genes. Gene clusters exhibit
substantially tighter expression patterns in case of real data, which is also reﬂected by topological differences between cluster dendrograms

from patterns of different biological functions (Eisen et al.,
1998). However, in artiﬁcial data, cluster quality measured by
Silhouette coefficients is substantially lower both for gene and
microarray clusters (Fig. 3a and b).

Co-expression patterns only emerge in artiﬁcial data for gene
sets that are predominantly controlled by the same transcription
factor. The fact that transcriptional regulation is the only mech-
anism to generate co-regulation patterns might explain that they
are less pronounced in artiﬁcial data and form unusual cluster
structures (Fig. 3c and d).

Similar to section 4.1, SynTReN yields a somewhat more real-
istic histogram for microarrays, while the gene cluster histogram
is multi-modal and unlike the one shown for the real data. Again,
the deviations between real data and GNW or GRENDEL are
similar in both degree and shape.

4.3 Network analyses (SynTReN)

TF and TG dependencies. This and the subsequent section evalu-
ate properties of GRIs. GRIs can be extracted from expression
data in a simple but effective manner based on the correlations
between TFs and TGs or between TGs and TGs (Butte and
Kohane, 1999). In turn, the feasibility of such an approach can
be assessed by examining whether pairs with high correlation
values are actually enriched in true TFeTG or TGeTG depen-
dencies (Fig. 4a and b). The comparison between the histograms
derived from artiﬁcial and real data revealed two important

differences. First, the enrichment of GRIs at high correlation
values was markedly stronger for artiﬁcial data indicating that
GRI inference is easier than in case of E.cali data. Second, arti-
ﬁcial data showed similar degrees of enrichment for positive and
negative correlations (activating and inhibiting relationships),
whereas we could only detect an enrichment for positive correl-
ations in case of real data (Fig. 4a). Apparently, mostly activat-
ing relationships can be observed in the real data, which is
consistent with earlier observations (Naeem et al., 2012).

TF activity histogram. The activity of transcriptional regula-
tors such as TFs can be determined Via statistical tests from
expression changes exhibited by their targets (Fig. 4c).
Strikingly, while the majority of TFs were found active in at
least 10% of the real measurements, 50% of the TFs were
never active in artiﬁcial profiles. Changes in TF activity are
caused by transcriptional regulation only as other layers of regu-
lation that could mediate such activity changes (e.g. protein
modiﬁcation) are neglected in current simulators.

Note that such gene set enrichment tests are used analogously
for the detection of active TFs as well as of differentially expressed
biological processes (Naeem et al., 2012). As biological processes
are typically not modeled in simulated datasets, we can still exam-
ine the performance of gene set enrichment tests Via TF activities.

For the network analyses described in this section, the remain-
ing two simulators exhibit similar patterns of deviation that are
even stronger as those shown in Figure 4.

TF-TG correlation

TG-TG correlation

Fraction of chips: TF activity

Fig. 4. Analysis of gene regulatory networks. Histograms are also applied to evaluate properties of TFeTG interactions in regulatory networks of E.cali
and SynTReN. In (a) and (b), we examine to what extent TFeTG interactions and pairs of TGs regulated by the same TFs, respectively, can be identiﬁed
based on correlation. Positive or negative differences in density [ordinate, non-continuous in (a)] indicate that the chances to detect true TFeTG or TGe
TG relationships in the given correlation intervals are increased or decreased, respectively. Interactions were also analyzed for a yeast and an alternative
E.cali dataset. In (c), the activity of TFs is inferred from the levels of differential expression exhibited by their TGs. Shown is the density (ordinate) of TFs
active in a given fraction of the available chips. The leftmost histogram bin corresponds to a fraction of 0 and thus denotes TFs that are never found

active

4.4 Organism comparison

Furthermore, we repeated the above analyses for a comparison
between four real expression compendia compiled for E.cali and
S.cerevisiae (Fig. l, heatmap). Generally, the compared histo-
grams exhibited differences that are substantially smaller than
the deviations exhibited in the comparisons of real and artiﬁcial
data described above. Although it is known that network infer-
ence is more difﬁcult in eukaryotes (Kilffner et al., 2012;
Marbach et al., 2012; Narendra et al., 2011), there are only
little differences in the overall shape of E.cali and yeast histo-
grams for TFeTG dependencies. However, in contrast to E.cali,
a high correlation between TFs and TGs alone is not a good
indicator for GRIs in yeast (Fig. 4a). This can also be observed in
the heatmap of Figure l, where the three examined network
properties show a similar degree of deviation between E.cali
and S .cerevisiae on the one hand and the real and artiﬁcial data-
sets on the other hand.

4.5 Separability of real and artiﬁcial datasets

We tested several scoring schemes to show that differences be-
tween the property histograms of real and artiﬁcial datasets are
statistically significant based on the t—test. Real and artiﬁcial data
are signiﬁcantly different for 10 of 12 property histograms. In
contrast, alternative scoring schemes, such as Wilcoxon’s test or
the relative entropy, could distinguish datasets for substantially
fewer properties. See section 1 of the Supplementary Material for
more details.

5 DISCUSSION

Simulated datasets aim to bridge the gap to dependable gold
standards that are required for the development and validation
of tools across many expression data analysis steps. For the ap-
plication to algorithm benchmarks, simulators should be able to
emulate the properties of real data. To test this ability, we
applied several important steps in gene expression data analysis

ranging from clustering to the inference of GRIs. The results of
these analyses were represented as property histograms for the
comparison of real and artificial datasets. Data generated by
three gene network simulators were compared with four expres-
sion compendia measured in E.cali and S.cerevisiae.

We showed that property histograms facilitate the character-
ization and comparison of expression compendia. Most import-
antly, histograms were highly consistent across different real
expression compendia and even between different organisms.
In contrast, simulated data exhibited markedly different ranges
of values and shapes. The captured properties thus clearly sepa-
rated real and simulated data in analogy to Turing’s test.

We observed strong deviations even in basic intensity and
noise histograms. These are likely due to simpliﬁed simulation
models omitting steps that play a role in real measurements such
as the modeling of mRNA concentrations and their quantifica-
tion by optical detectors. We constructed further histograms
from clustering approaches to compare resulting clusters of
genes and experimental conditions. Artificial co-regulation
patterns as detected by clustering are exclusively generated by
transcriptional regulation, as this is typically the only regulatory
mechanism implemented in current simulators. However, the
most striking and reproducible (i.e. found in all examined simu-
lators) deviations were observed for properties derived from gene
regulatory networks. This is surprising, as the examined simula-
tors were particularly devised for the assessment of network
inference approaches.

Many simulators aim to use realistic gene regulatory network
topologies, e.g. sampled from experimentally derived GRIs, in-
stead of random networks. However, other important layers of
regulation such as different cellular states or signal transduction
are neglected that in real data contribute to the complexity of
expression patterns. Furthermore, executable models are con-
structed by arbitrarily selecting model parameters for the dy-
namic simulation of GRIs. Datasets generated in such a setup
will differ substantially from real measurements even if realistic
GRI topologies are used. Indeed, none of the different topologies

A Turing test for artificial expression data

 

implemented by the three simulators substantially reduced the
observed differences to real data.

Realistic data simulation requires a careful analysis of proper-
ties of network topologies, dynamic parameters and their rela-
tionship to the generated expression data. Our results suggest
several improvements: (i) The expression model should be im-
proved to produce normally distributed data in the range of
typical expression measurement platforms, so that, for instance,
fold changes have a similar meaning as in real datasets. The
simulation of noise is important, but excessive noise levels
should be avoided. (ii) The generation of realistic co-regulation
patterns requires the emulation of groups of TFs, their combina-
torial effects and the conditions for becoming active. (iii) As a
related topic, we note that random parameterization (GNW,
GRENDEL) or random mapping of experimentally determined
parameters onto the network (SynTReN) is not adequate.
Instead, an iterative optimization of model parameters could
preserve dataset properties such as those that we described
here. (iv) Simulators should implement regulation on the protein
level. Currently, the simulation of just transcriptional regulation
over-simplifies network inference, as all regulatory events
become Visible at the level of gene expression. (V) Finally, simu-
lators should account for the diversity of genes, for instance,
regarding the number of regulatory states, instead of assuming
that one model is sufﬁcient to generate all data. This would help
to reproduce the broader distributions of properties derived
from real data.

Our approach (see availability for Web site and software)
offers a detailed comparative analysis of expression data gener-
ated by real and artiﬁcial gene regulatory networks. Our assess-
ment is based on typical data processing and analysis pipelines.
We thereby provided an important layer of assessment on top of
data simulators that are essential tools for both data analysis and
network inference when no reliable gold standards are available.
The analysis suggested several ways for improving current
simulators to generate more realistic datasets.

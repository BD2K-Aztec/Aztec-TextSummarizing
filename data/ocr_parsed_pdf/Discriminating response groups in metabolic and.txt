ABSTRACT

Motivation: Analysis of omics experiments generates lists of entities
(genes, metabolites, etc.) selected based on specific behavior, such
as changes in response to stress or other signals. Functional
interpretation of these lists often uses category enrichment tests
using functional annotations like Gene Ontology terms and pathway
membership. This approach does not consider the connected
structure of biochemical pathways or the causal directionality of
events.

Results: The Omics Response Group (ORG) method, described
in this work, interprets omics lists in the context of metabolic
pathway and regulatory networks using a statistical model for flow
within the networks. Statistical results for all response groups are
visualized in a novel Pathway Flow plot. The statistical tests are
based on the Erlang distribution model under the assumption of
independent and identically Exponential-distributed random walk
flows through pathways. As a proof of concept, we applied our
method to an Escherichia coli transcriptomics dataset where we
confirmed common knowledge of the E. coli transcriptional response
to Lipid A deprivation. The main response is related to osmotic stress,
and we were also able to detect novel responses that are supported
by the literature. We also applied our method to an Arabidopsis
thaliana expression dataset from an abscisic acid study. In both
cases, conventional pathway enrichment tests detected nothing,
while our approach discovered biological processes beyond the
original studies.

Availability: We created a prototype for an interactive ORG web
tool at http://ecoserver.vrac.iastate.edu/pathwayflow (source code
is available from https://subversion.vrac.iastate.edu/Subversion/jlv/

1 INTRODUCTION

Analysis of omics experiments generates lists of entities (genes,
metabolites, etc.) selected based on speciﬁc behavior. These lists are
then analyzed using existing functional knowledge of the entities
in a list by further listing the functional annotations assigned to

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

the members of the list. Category enrichment analysis generally
refers to testing the null hypothesis that the distribution of functional
annotation in the entity list is similar to the distribution of functional
annotation for all entities (Barry et (11., 2005; Maere et (11., 2005;
Nettleton et (11., 2008; Subramanian et (11., 2005). If the null
hypothesis is rejected, one or more of the functional annotations
in the entity list is either over- or underrepresented, and a general
functional response is inferred for the experimental treatment. Most
biologists mine a number of sets of genes from results that exhibit
an expected behavior of biological interest. These sets are mapped
to functional annotation to determine which functions are associated
with the behavior in the experiment. For example, a gene expression
proﬁling assay might be conducting on samples for both a stress
condition and a control. The genes which are upregulated by a
certain fold-Change are selected to comprise the gene set of interest
and all genes are mapped to zero or more Gene Ontology terms.
The proportion of each term represented in the upregulated gene set
is compared with its proportion in the general population of genes
(Maere et (11., 2005). Alternative methods compare estimates of the
expression distributions across treatments to mine category-related
effects (Nettleton et (11., 2008).

Much biological knowledge is represented as networks, whether
it is ontological (Ashbumer et (11., 2000; Avraham et (11., 2008;
Cordero et (11., 2009), regulatory (RegulonDB (Gama-Castro et (11.,
2011) or metabolic [Reactome (Matthews et (11., 2009), KEGG (Aoki
and Kanehisa, 2005; Kanehisa et (11., 2010; Okuda et (11., 2008),
PathwayTools/BioCyC (Krummenacker et (11., 2005) and Plant
Metabolic Network (Zhang et (11., 2010)]. This makes functional
analysis much more complex than simple set comparisons, requiring
more complex tools like MapMan (Rotter et (11., 2009; Usadel
et (11., 2009), Array2KEGG (Kim et (11., 2010) or KEGG Spider
(Antonov et (11., 2008) to name a few. A main problem is that
pathway mining is treated as a category enrichment problem based
on pathway membership alone. Such an approach fails to consider
the interconnectivity and reactive relationships between different
entities, reactions and pathways. Further, category enrichment
cannot directly infer causality; if a functional annotation term is
enriched in an entity list, we cannot determine whether the functional
process affects the omics entities or the omics entities affect the
process. Other methods like Nayak and De (2007) partition pathway
networks, but stop where our method operates: discriminating
pathway partitions or response groups. Our pathway mining method
does not attempt to Cluster or partition the network—it assumes it
has already by partitioned into response groups.

With respect to comparing networks or parts of networks, many
stochastic- and ﬂow-based methods for processing networks assume

the network is undirected. This means each edge in the network
links a pair of nodes in no particular order. This works well for
applications such as protein—protein interaction (Towﬁc et al., 2010)
or co-expression networks (Mao et al., 2009; van Dongen, 2000).
However, biochemical pathways are inherently directed networks.
Directed networks’ edges have a speciﬁc ordering; one of the nodes
a directed edge connects is the source and the other node is the
target and the directed edge deﬁnes a ﬂow from one node (the
source) to the other (the target). Nodes in a pathway network
represent physical entities such as genes or enzymes, as well as
events such as Chemical reactions. Edges between nodes represent
interaction (e.g. regulation or conversion) and/or participation in an
event (e.g. catalysis of a reaction). Direction is necessary to indicate
the direction of reactions, i.e. which participants are catabolized
and which are anabolized in a particular reaction. Methods also
exist for stochastic and analytical modeling of directed networks
(Hoops et al., 2006; Ramsey et al., 2005) for the purpose of
kinetic simulations. These traditional systems biology analyses are
often limited by the number of experimentally derived kinetic rate
constants available for a particular organism and condition (Adiamah
et al., 2010; Lubitz et al., 2010).

Our purpose in this work is to provide a methodology for
discriminating groups of entities (Response Groups) in a pathway
network, which are highly connected in a speciﬁc direction to a
Query List of entities using statistically sound hypothesis testing
and visualization.

1.1 Background terminology

Flow simulation models the movement of mass through a network as
it travels via the graph’s nodes and edges within constraints deﬁned
by the connectivity, edge weights and edge directionality. Flow
simulation can be decomposed to a problem of connectivity matrix
multiplication and used to solve a variety of problems. Flow-based
metrics represent relationships (ﬂows) between connected groups of
vertices in a graph, whereas distance metrics like shortest path are
limited to pair-wise comparisons. Graphical Clustering methods,
such as MCL (Markov Clustering) (van Dongen, 2000), make use
of ﬂow simulation, where input is a network of nodes connected by
undirected, weighted edges. The algorithm takes successive powers
of the stochastic state transition probability matrix, with an inﬂation
step at each iteration based on a single inﬂation parameter that
degrades low-ﬂowing edges until they vanish, creating a set of
connected components which represent the resulting Clusters. This
method Clusters data based on the structure of some meaningful
undirected graph representing it, such as a correlation network as in
(Mao et al., 2009).

Graph kernels are ﬁinctions that take adjacency matrices for two
graphs and return as results a metric that usually compares the two
networks (Vishwanathan et al., 2010). A random walk kernel is a
kernel that conducts operations on the input matrices, which simulate
random walks along the edges of the input matrices’ networks.
Towﬁc et al. (2010) have used a state transition probability matrix
multiplication called the random walk kernel to infer homologs
from protein interaction networks. (For the necessary graph theory
terminology, see Supplementary Material.)

A Response Group, deﬁned for this work, is a subnetwork
of a pathway network deﬁned by a common function or other
biologically meaningful grouping. For example, out of the entire

network that represents known metabolism in Escherichia coli, the
set of reactions, genes, enzymes and compounds that make up the
Glycolysis pathway can also be a Response Group. A Response
Group need not be connected; a connected subnetwork or module,
like a pathway, is a special case with a pathway ﬁinction-
speciﬁc meaning. Other Response Group partitions might deﬁne
all compounds of a certain Class, or a group of pathways which
are functionally related, but not directly connected to each other.
A Query List, deﬁned for this work, is a list of metabolic entities
(genes, enzymes, compounds, etc.), which have been mined from
an experimental dataset. Our goal is to determine which Response
Groups in a pathway network are highly connected to the Query
List as a whole, both in the forward (or downstream) and reverse
(or upstream) directions.

2 METHODS

The Omics Response Group (ORG) method uses a pathway network to mine
response groups, which are highly connected to a query list in a speciﬁc
direction. ORG uses directed random walks, or ﬂows, through the pathway
network with stochastic matrix multiplication. The combined ﬂow between
the query list and each response group results in a single value representing
ﬂow between the query list and each response group, in both the forward
(downstream) and reverse (upstream) pathway directions.

In order to test the signiﬁcance of the results, we model the underlying
distribution of ﬂows in the network using the Exponential distribution and
the summary metric, 8g, for each Response Group, g, using the Erlang
Cumulative Distribution Function. For each Response Group, we bootstrap
Erlang distribution parameters kg (shape) and Ag (rate) using Monte Carlo
simulations of random query lists, and assess ﬁt to the corresponding Erlang
Probability Density Function. The results are corrected for multiple testing
and Visualized using a novel pathway ﬂow plot. In brief, our method includes
the following design decisions:

(1) Receive as input a biochemical pathway network structure, a Query
List of entities referred to by nodes in the pathway network, and a
deﬁnition of Response Groups to discriminate.

(2) Entities in a Query List could be any combination of genes, enzymes,
chemical compounds, or reaction events in the pathway network and
Response Group compartmentalization must be ﬂexible; Response
Groups can be the set of all functional pathways in the network, all
reactions in the network or the set of all compound classes in the
network, for example.

(3) Response Groups must be able to overlap on zero or more entities;
entities, both members and non-members of the Query List, must be
able to be members of multiple Response Groups.

(4) The set of all Response Groups need not cover the entire pathway
network; not all nodes in the pathway network are guaranteed to be
a member of any Response Group.

2.1 Modeling directed random walks

Flow simulation using directed graphs is possible using stochastic state
transition probability matrices. Consider the right-stochastic state transition
probability matrix AN xN to represent a random walk on the network of a
ﬁnite number of steps. In a given step in a random walk starting at node
i, we must take a step somewhere, so the sum of the elements in the i-th
row must equal one (2A,; 2 1). On the other hand, if a random walks step
lands on node j, the step must have come from somewhere, so the sum 2A.]-
(a column in ANxN) should equal 1. If the network is not left-stochastic,
this sum may be less or greater than one, neither of which make sense.
We consider relationships in each direction separately, so we will avoid the

For a state transition probability matrix, ANxN, the probability of
transitioning from state i to state j in exactly w steps is Awij. To obtain
the probability of any of the steps reaching (or hitting) state j in a random
walk of exactly w steps starting at state i, we take the sum of successive
powers of A up to Aw, MNxN, which would be the matrix of hit rates in a
random walk of length w steps [Equation (4)].

Given a biochemical pathway network represented by a weighted
adjacency matrix, CNxN, we can right-stochastize it to ﬁt the form of A in
Equation (2) by dividing the values in C by the sum of their respective row
as in Equation (3). Adjacency matrices for most networks are sparse, but as
successive powers are summed, the resulting matrix quickly becomes dense
and difﬁcult to process. Fortunately, biochemical pathway networks, while
sparse and not necessarily small-world networks (Koschutzki et al., 2010;
Park et al., 2010), contain several hub nodes, which are highly connected
to the rest of the network (e.g. energy-storing compounds and secondary
messengers), allow relatively short random walk models (10720 steps) to
cover most of a pathway networkgeven across compartmental membranes
Via signaling and transport pathways. This is consistent with ﬁndings in
(Koschutzki et al., 2010). The resulting matrix M is the matrix of hit rates
on random walks between nodes; Mi]- is the hit rate at j of random walks of
size w steps starting at i. Generally, we call this metric ‘random walk ﬂow”.
This metric is preferred to others such as shortest path because ﬂow considers
all possible paths simultaneously, including those paths that include loops.

2.2 Summarizing ﬂows between groups of nodes

Our goal is to determine which response groups in a pathway network
are highly connected in a particular direction to a query list. Figure 1 is
a hypothetical example: the query list is a list of genes that are differentially
expressed under a speciﬁc condition (red-bordered nodes). The response
groups could be the functional pathways, each a different color. We want
to compute and test network ﬂows between the query list nodes and each
response group.

The sum of random walk hit rates between nodes in the query list and
nodes in a response group summarizes the ﬂow between the query list and
response group. This is a simple matrix operation using a response group
membership indicator matrix, TNXc [Equation (5)], where Tng = 1 if node n
is a member of response group g and zero otherwise. The matrix product of
the matrices MNxN and TNXc, \Ilec; contains the sums of ﬂow from each
node and the nodes in each response group [Equation (7)]. Similarly, the
matrix product of an indicator vector, Q [X N [Equation (6)] where Q” = 1 if
n is in the query list and zero otherwise, and \Ilec; is 81 Xc, is the vector of
sums of ﬂow from the nodes in the query list to the nodes in each response
group [Equation (8)].

Fig. 1. A hypothetical ORG network example. Response groups are
represented by different color nodes and red-bordered nodes are members of
the query list. We want to determine which colors are more near the input
query list than a random query list. Here, it appears the query list is generally
near the yellow response group.

2.3 Modeling and testing values in (9

After obtaining relationships for random walk ﬂow between the query list
and each response group, we want to ﬁnd statistical signiﬁcant ﬂows between
the query list and response groups; these are the response groups which are
highly connected to the query list in a speciﬁc direction and are likely to
be functionally linked to the query list. This is accomplished by a statistical
test of the null hypothesis that the observed random walk ﬂow between a
response group g and the query list is equal to that of a randomly selected
query list and g. There are two complicating considerations for designing
such a test: Response group size and inherent connectedness.

2.3.] Response group size Given a query list, the number of nodes and
edges in each response group is variable; some response groups are larger
than others. Therefore, we must account for the assumption that larger
response groups are more likely to have higher random walk ﬂow with a
query list than smaller response groups. For the set of ﬂows between the
members of our query list and a given response group, we must summarize
these ﬂows to a single value which represents them as a whole. We do
that with each 8g as it is a sum of hit rates. Using mean ﬂows instead
of sums would account for the problem because it would penalize larger
response groups, i.e. 9g would be changed to  where Ng is the size of
response group g. Means would also complicate the matrix operations we
use to summarize the ﬂows, and mean metrics are susceptible to outliers,
which could bias our model. For this reason, we use the Erlang distribution,

which has parameters that account for this problem, to model 8g.

2.3.2 Response group connectedness Response groups have varied
connectivity with the rest of the pathway network due to its inherent structure.
This can also cause bias in ﬂow metrics where more connected response
groups are more likely to have higher ﬂows with a random query list than
smaller response groups. While there may be a correlation between response
group size and connectedness, it is not guaranteed, so we must account for
all combinations of size and connectivity. For this reason and the fact that
the distributions of ﬂows for an arbitrary directed metabolic network are not
well known, we bootstrap parameters for each Erlang-distributed OS. from a
Monte Carlo simulation of random query lists.

2.3.3 The ﬂow distribution underlying 9g We assess our assumption of
the Exponential distribution of values in the M matrix [Equation (4)] using a
bootstrapped sample of its values (Fig. 2). Most of these non-negative values

are near zero, with a skewed upper tail containing those higher random walk
ﬂow relationships. A common probability distribution with these properties
is the Exponential distribution, which is often used to model waiting times
for an event to occur, such as the time until a light bulb will burn out (Evans
et al., 2000). Plotting the bootstrapped sample from observed ﬂows for
random walks of w=10 steps on the EcoCyc pathway network (Keseler
et al., 2011) gives a good ﬁt to an Exponential distribution for values more
distant from zero.

The Exponential distribution has many useful properties. One is that
the sum of k independent and identically distributed Exponential random
variables with rate parameter A follows the Erlang distribution with shape
parameter k and rate parameter A. The Erlang distribution is a special case
of the Gamma distribution where the shape parameter is an integer (Evans
et al., 2000), which is the number of summed Exponential random variables.
This makes the Erlang distribution well-suited to model our null hypothesis
that the Query List is unrelated to a Response Group. Since the matrix
multiplication in Equation (8) actually sums the values in M for a given
query list in each response group, we can assume that the values in the O
vectors each follow a different Erlang distribution with same shape parameter
equal to the size of the query list and rate parameter equal to the inverse of
the mean of all values in M [Equations (9712)].

Assessing the Erlang-based model involves a Monte Carlo simulation,
which repeatedly draws, with replacement, a random query list of k entities
out of the pathway network and compute 8 each draw, building a multivariate
(in the number of response groups) sampling distribution for O. For a given
response group, we then ﬁt an Erlang distribution to the simulated results
using the convenient Erlang distribution property that the rate parameter
equals the ratio of the shape parameter to the mean. With this ternary
relationship, we can estimate the rate parameter by taking the ratio of the
shape parameter (k) to the mean of the Monte Carlo simulation. As with
the Exponential distribution above, for a given query list size and response
group, we can then inspect ﬁt by plotting the histogram of the Monte Carlo
values with the density of the ﬁt Erlang distribution as well as creating a
QuantileiQuantile plot for each 9g (Fig. 3).

random walk simulations of w: 10 steps on the EcoCyc pathway network
and 100 Monte Carlo simulations of ﬂow rates with a query list of size
k = 123. Showing good ﬁt to an Erlang density function is the assessment for
an arbitrarily selected pathway response group, g, the putrescine degradation
II pathway. Such an assessment can be done for each response group.

2.3.4 Hypothesis testing After computing our vector of Erlang-based test
statistics, 8, we can deﬁne a null hypothesis to test for each value in 8,
where each value represents ﬂow between the query list and a response
group. We stated earlier that the goal is to test the case where there is no
ﬂow relationship between a response group g and the query list, so our null
hypothesis, H0, is that the unknown true rate parameter, )3“, equals the Monte
Carlo-estimated Ag, which can be interpreted as the rate parameter for ﬂows
between unrelated query lists and response groups [Equation (13)].

The alternative hypothesis should reﬂect a high ﬂow rate between the
query list and the response group g; a random query list drawn from the
set of nodes, which are biologically linked to response group g would
follow an Erlang distribution with the same shape parameter, k, but a larger
rate parameter, Ag. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis is the upper-tail in
Equation (14).

And we reject H0 if the observed 8g falls above the (1 —ot) percentile
of the Erlang distribution with shape k and rate Ag, where 01 is a selected
Type I Error Rate, which is the rate at which the null hypothesis is rejected
incorrectly [Equation (15)].

H0 : 13:1,, (13)
HA : Ag>kg (14)
Rej. H0 if PMW (X > 9g) 5a (15)

When multiple hypothesis tests are conducted simultaneously, the family-
wise error rate (FWER) is inﬂated by the number of tests; e.g. if we conduct
10 tests, each with 01 20.01, each test has a 1% probability of making a Type
I Error, but the overall probability of making a Type I Error is the sum of
each at, or 0.01 X 10: 0.1. The multiple testing problem has been a focus for
mining high-throughput data, such as microarrays because families of tests
are conducted on thousands of genes in this ﬁeld creating strong demand
for clever correction methods. The most straightforward and conservative
correction, Bonferronni (Holm, 1979), simply uses a corrected ()1 value for
tests equal to the original desired Type I Error Rate divided by the number of
tests, ot’ = ﬁ , where m is the number of tests. Several more complex methods
exist which focus on the false discovery rate and estimate parameters for
the speciﬁc distribution that P-Values follow for microarray experiments
(Fodor et al., 2007; Storey, 2003; Storey et al., 2004; Storey and Tibshirani,
2003), where P-Values are uniformly distributed between zero and one with
a spike near zero containing the relatively large set of genes perturbed by the
experiment. However, P-Values for response groups are not always expected
to follow such a distribution because there are often only a few signiﬁcant
response groups in one of our analyses. For this reason, we discretionarin use
Bonferroni correction to correct for multiple testing where an independent
test is conducted for each response group.

regulate. The question of what is regulating the query list, or signaling
its members to change behavior, is often equally or even more interesting.
We can reverse direction rearranging the matrix multiplication to compute
a different, but analogous set of metrics, statistics and hypothesis test
[Supplementary Equations (S1)7(S7)] resulting in another vector of ﬂow
rates for each response group, 8””) and hypothesis test [Supplementary
Equations (S8)7(S10)]. The difference is that these reversed ﬂow rates
represent ﬂow summaries from the response groups to the query list.

In order to compute reverse ﬂows, we reinitialized the random walk rate
matrix, A, asAWV) by left-stochastizing the adjacency matrix [Supplementary
Equation (S 1)] because reverse direction focuses on backtracking the directed
graph using arrival probabilities, which are represented by columns in Am”).
Again, the alternative hypothesis is in the upper tail of Supplementary
Equation (S9).

In addition to the two sets of analogous ﬂow metrics, we can also compute
a third set [Supplementary Equations (S11)7(S16)], which reﬂects a sum
of the ﬁrst two. This might be used as an in initial investigation or in
cases where directionality in the pathway networks is not well known.
If we sum the ﬂow rates in both directions at the \II step, we get ﬂow
rate summaries between the query list and each response group overall [in
both directions, 90‘”) in Supplementary Equation (S11)]. Like before, the
alternative hypothesis is in the upper tail of Supplementary Equation (S 15).
Assessments in Supplementary Figures S5 and S6 show that our assumptions
are accurate for these directions as well.

2.5 Visualizing results with PathwayFlow plots

Results for all response groups can be Visualized simultaneously for manually
investigation and selection. We plot a data point for each response group, g,
in a 2D space where the X -axis is the inverse of the ﬁt rate parameter, A, and
the Y-axis is the observed ﬂow statistic, 8g. We can then plot a one-tailed
Erlang conﬁdence interval boundary line marking the lowest Y-axis locations

a response group can exist and have a signiﬁcantly high ﬂow with the query
list (Fig. 4).

3 EXAMPLES

For real data examples, we applied the ORG method to publicly
available microarray datasets for E.coli and A.thaliana (Figure 5).
We Chose these model organisms because there are relatively rich
pathway networks available from EcoCyc (Keseler et al., 2011) and
AraCyC (Rhee et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005). Both datasets pertain
to well-studied processes and we show that our results are more

complete than existing methods and are consistent with the literature
(Batchelor et al., 2005; Loui et al., 2009; Raetz et al., 2006).

Genes, protein products, metabolites, and reaction and regulation
events were grouped into response groups representing pathways
found in the EcoCyc version 15.0 and AraCyC version 7
metabolic networks. For each experiment, two different query lists
were mined using GEO’s T-test data analysis tool. Single-tailed
tests at the 90% conﬁdence level for ‘Control<treatment’ and
‘treatment>control’ created a query list for upregulated genes
and downregulated genes, respectively. These lists are not actually
genes, but probeset identiﬁcation numbers that do not exist in
our reference pathway networks. We mapped the probesets IDs
to corresponding EcoCyc and AraCyC genes according to common
locus IDs.

3.1 Lipid A inhibition in E.coli

The data for this use case comes from the GEO (Barrett et al.,
2009) dataset accession GDS3597 by Zhu et al. (2009), who
investigated transcriptional regulation by FabR of the fatty acid
biosynthesis genes fabA and fabB in the presence of endogenous
and/or exogenous unsaturated fatty acids. Among other factors in
their experiment, gene expression was measured in a control and
treatment with CHIR-090, an antibiotic that inhibits the biosynthesis
of Lipid A (Barb et al., 2007). Lipid A is the anchor by which
lipopolysaccharides attach to the outer membrane of Gram-negative
bacteria, which provide much of the cell’s structural stability and
are also recognized by immune systems.

In all, 123 upregulated EcoCyc genes were identiﬁed from the
list of probesets whose expression is induced when lipid A synthesis
was inhibited. Our method results in three different PathwayFlow
plots: one for each of the forward direction, reverse direction and
total, respectively [Supplementary Fig. S4(a)]. We used Bonferroni
correction at the 95% conﬁdence level and the red cutoff lines are
drawn accordingly. Pathways that fall above the red lines have
signiﬁcantly high ﬂow with the query list and are listed below
with P-values. The superpathway of KDOZ-lipid A biosynthesis
is the only pathway that is a signiﬁcant successor (downstream
in the directed pathway network) to our query list of upregulated
genes, with a P <0.0001. This is the expected result when the
cells are unable to produce the lipid A they require for membrane
structure; they are increasing their efforts to produce more lipid
A. The CprR Two-Component Signal Transduction System is the
only signiﬁcant predecessor (upstream) pathway to our query list
of upregulated genes, with a P < 0.0001. This is a signaling system
which senses cell envelope stress (Wolfe et al., 2008), which is also
expected because we can interpret our results as evidence for CprR
signaling the increased expression of the genes in our query list.
The Cprr system responds to cell envelope stress and regulates
transcription of the porin genes ompF and ompC, and a loss of
function mutation in Cprr can result in increased transcription of

ompC and decreased transcription of ompF (Batchelor et al., 2005).
Pathway enrichment analysis using hypergeometric tests detected
nothing.

In all, 81 downregulated EcoCyc genes were identiﬁed from
the list of probesets switched to lower expression when lipid
A synthesis was inhibited, and pathway response groups are
plotted in Supplementary Figure S4(b). When conservatively using
Bonferroni correction, two pathways were signiﬁcant, but some
pathways are plotted very near the signiﬁcance cutoff line. We
adjusted the conﬁdence level to 99% and skipped Bonferroni
correction to be slightly less conservative with our Erlang tests. The
TorSR and ZraSR Two-Component Signal Transduction Systems
are the signiﬁcant successor (forward direction) pathways to the
query list. The TorSR system regulates use of Trimethylamine
N -oxide (TMAO), which is both an osmoprotectant and alternative
electron acceptor during anaerobic respiration (Ansaldi et al.,
2000). The ZraSR system senses toxic levels of zinc and lead in
the periplasm. The Cprr Two-Component Signal Transduction
System and Acetoacetate Degradation to Acetyl CoA pathways
are the signiﬁcant predecessors (reverse direction) to the query
list. Recall that the Cprr system also appeared in the signiﬁcant
predecessor pathways of the upregulated query list, which might
be explained by a feedback loop. In this case, the Cprr system
has an extremely low P-value, so if we adjust the conﬁdence level
for the Erlang test, it will not drop out of either the upregulated
or the downregulated pathways. If we adjust the conﬁdence
level for the T-tests used to generate the up- and downregulated
gene lists, we checked whether the Erlang test results change.
After entering query lists based on T-test at the 95% conﬁdence
level, results for the upregulated pathways in both forward and
reverse directions as well as downregulated successors (forward
direction) remained constant, while downregulated predecessors
(reverse direction) changed from Cprr to the DpiAB Two-
Component Signal Transduction System, which regulates citrate
fermentation genes. The DpiAB system is also known to interrupt
chromosome duplication in the SOS response (Yamamoto et al.,
2008). Acetoacetate degradation feeds carbon energy into the TCA
cycle (Pauli and Overath, 1972) and genes for this production are
negatively regulated by ArcA. Pathway enrichment analysis using
hypergeometric tests and the MRPP method (Nettleton et al., 2008)
detected nothing.

In summary, lipid A inhibition causes a breakdown of the cell’s
structure and osmotic stress, which the cell senses and responds
with several different methods of action. First, it activates the
genes to produce both the inhibited lipid A (Table 1{1}) and the
KDO (Table 1{2}) that the lipid A should be anchoring to the cell
membrane. It also shifts priorities away from growth (Table 1 {6,9 }),
toxin sensing in the periplasm (Table 1{5,9}) and osmoprotectant
production (Table 1{7}). OmpR activation is increased because
both OmpC and OmpF porins production require it (Table 1{3}),
but since the promoter for ompf has higher afﬁnity for OmpR-
P than the promoter for ompc, ompF transcription is speciﬁcally
decreased using a separate mechanism (Table 1{4}) so that only
OmpC porins are produced. Most of these inferences are consistent
with the literature, and we can hypothesize that the cell knows that
the osmotic stress is caused by structural insufﬁciencies and not by a
severe change in solute concentrations, so it chooses not to produce
osmoprotectant. See Supplementary Figure S10 for a ﬂowchart of
the transcriptional response.

3.2 ABA signaling in A.thaliana

Expression data from GEO dataset accession GDS2730 by Kuhn
et al. (2008) was used for a second example. In this study, the
role of abh1 in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling was investigated.
ABA signaling is known to be involved in many plant processes
including but not limited to seed development and abiotic stress
response (Kuhn et al., 2008). The two query lists contain genes
up- and downregulated under ABA treatment. AraCyc 7 lacks gene
regulatory data, meaning gene predecessors cannot be mined as they
can be in EcoCyc. Instead, we can only discriminate downstream of
the gene query lists.

In all, 259 probesets were identiﬁed as upregulated and mapped
to AraCyc genes. The pathways galactosylcyclitol biosynthesis,
ajugose biosynthesis II (galactinol-independent) and ajugose
biosynthesis I (galactinol-dependent) produced signiﬁcant Erlang
tests (all P < 0.0001). These pathways are all related to stachyose
synthesis, which is known to be the dominant sugar found in
the ‘resurrection plant’, Craterostigma plantagineum and can play
a role in stress response (Bartels and Salamini, 2001). Pathway
enrichment analysis using hypergeometric tests and the MRPP
method (Nettleton et al., 2008) detected nothing.

Like the E. coli example, we took a subset of data from a previous
study and used our method to discover relevant Response Groups
different from the processes investigated in the original study, but
consistent with the literature.

4 DISCUSSION

We took a subset of expression data from work investigating fab
genes’ roles in E.coli cell membrane homeostasis and uncovered
new insights supported by the literature. We clearly saw activity
relevant to the cell’s boundary (envelope and periplasm), which is
consistent with our understanding of the utility of lipid A. Likewise,
the set of upregulated A. thaliana genes under ABA exposure tested
signiﬁcantly connected to stress-related responses. We compared
results to two category enrichment testing methods where pathway
membership according to respective BioCyc databases was used
to assign categories: hypergeometric tests, a simple approach which
tests for category overrepresentation in the query list, and the MRPP
method which tests multivariate distributions of expression across
categories and has been shown to perform better than other methods
(Nettleton et al., 2008). Our ORG method detected pathways which
ﬁt existing literature while these methods detected none, which
illustrates the main problem we set out to ameliorate. Category

Discriminating response groups in pathways

 

enrichment remains a common way to mine pathway databases
for functional insights into lists of differential expression genes.
However, pathways are not categories—they are subnetworks of a
larger, interconnected metabolic and regulatory system. A query list
can be functionally related to a pathway without containing any
members of the pathway, so we proposed computing the query list—
pathway relationship using ﬂow metrics and then simultaneously
plotting results for all pathways with our pathway ﬂow plot.
Our method can be generalized to mine user-deﬁned response
groups, which might be pathway subnetworks or other subnetworks
that may exhibit any or no connectivity. For example, we also
applied our method to mine individual reactions instead of entire
pathways for the E.coli data and results were also consistent with
the previous work (Supplementary Material). Existing category
enrichment methods are not applicable in this case because it relies
on membership in the response groups by many of the membership
of the query list, which is by deﬁnition rare for individual reactions.

While our method does not directly infer new pathway models,
it uses existing knowledge about pathways to generate hypotheses
about the members of a query list. Therefore, adding hypothesized
relationships to pathway models can strengthen the results. It uses
a biochemical pathway network structure, a Query List of entities,
and a set of Response Groups as input, in order to discriminate
Response Groups that are highly connected to the Query List
from those that are not. Entities in a Query List could be any
combination of genes, enzymes, chemical compounds or reaction
events in the pathway network while Response Groups can be the
set of all functional pathways in the network, all reactions in the
network or any other potentially overlapping or incomplete entity
grouping such as the set of all compound classes in the network,
for example. It can visualize statistical hypothesis test results for
decision support and discretionary test parameter adjustments, and
the hypothesis test accounts for both Response Group size and
inherent connectivity with the rest of the network. Our method is
distinctly different from kinetic simulation, which uses metabolic
networks and experimentally derived rate constants to predict
relative concentrations of all entities.

Further, our tools integrate with the MCL suite of tools (van
Dongen, 2000), which includes a preprocessing step to remove
cycles. We can run our method with or without this step. We
compared both results on our test data and saw little difference.
This makes sense because our method computes ran- dom walk hit
rates across all possible paths; cycles contribute to these rates, but
their contribution is dwarfed by that of all other paths.

The main weakness of the ORG method is sensitivity to missing
information from the pathway network, i.e. nodes and relationships
are missing from the network. If the ﬁinction of an entity in a
query list is not well understood, the best we can do with our
method is assume ‘guilt by association’ and infer its involvement in
the response groups we associate with the well-understood entities
in the query list. Methods exist for ﬁlling gaps, but they require
either human decision making, extra experimental data or ﬂux data
(Orth and Palsson, 2010). We considered pathway and regulatory
network gap-ﬁlling and de novo construction beyond the scope of
this article so that we could present a methodology for mining
existing biological knowledge. Another weakness is that reverse
ﬂow results are only possible when the pathway network contains
an adequate amount of gene—regulatory relationships, which are
represented by edges and ﬂows into genes. Cycles and feedback

loops might create ambiguity between signiﬁcant successor and
predecessor response groups, though we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant
differences when removing all loops.

As a proof of concept, we created a web-based implementation
of our method (See Supplementary material) and applied it to omics
data from a simple E. coli microarray dataset, veriﬁed the results with
the literature and generated new hypotheses. For this dataset, we
also compared our method to hypergeometric test-based enrichment
analysis. When correcting for multiple testing, enrichment testing
detects no signiﬁcant response groups. When (incorrectly) omitting
multiple testing correction, enrichment tests produce lists of
response groups not associated with the known behavior of the
dataset, while our method produced very similar results whether
or not we correct for multiple testing, indicating that our method
is also robust to multiple testing. Our method outperforms pathway
enrichment testing because our method considers pathway network
connectivity rather than direct pathway or group membership; it can
detect relationships between a query list and response group even if
the members of the query list are not members of the response group.
It also has the ability to detect directionality in those relationships,
which enrichment analysis lacks.

Future work includes application to more diverse omics datasets,
which include compounds and enzymes as well as more diverse
collections of response groups such as transcription factor families
and reaction classes. Our tool is compatible with output from the
Markov Clustering software (van Dongen, 2000) and we intend to
investigate Response Groups deﬁned by graphical clusters mined
from large metabolic networks. Lastly, the web tool is to be fully
integrated with the PLEde.org (Shen et al., 2005) website.

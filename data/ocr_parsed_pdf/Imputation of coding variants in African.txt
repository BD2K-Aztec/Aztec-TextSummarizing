Imputation of coding variants in African Americans

 

et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013) have enhanced imputation quality,
especially for rare variants with minor allele frequency (MAF)
<5%. These improvements have resulted in both discovery and
refined mapping of association with complex traits (Auer et al.,
2012; Holm et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012). However, few stu—
dies have examined the use of large study—speciﬁc reference
panels, particularly the use of exome sequencing—derived panels
in admixed populations. Here, we present a new resource for
imputation in African Americans, built from 1692 African
Americans sequenced by the Exome Sequencing Project (ESP)
(Tennessen et al., 2012). We assessed the use of the ESP data as
an imputation reference panel and compared the results with
those obtained using the 1000 Genomes Project Phasel
(1000G; version 3, March 2012 release) (The 1000 Genomes
Project Consortium, 2012) data. Additionally, we evaluated the
potential consequences of using a reference panel built from sam—
ples selected on the basis of phenotypic extremes or disease status
instead of a population—based random sample. Lastly, we com—
pared multiple approaches to combine the ESP and 1000G
panels for the imputation of rare coding variants.

2 METHODS
2.1 Exome Sequencing Project

2.1.1 ESP and African American Participants The complete ESP
dataset (Fu et al., 2012) consists of whole exome data for 6823 individ-
uals. Samples were sequenced at the University of Washington
(SeattleGO) and the Broad Institute (BroadGO). Among the 6823 indi-
viduals, 1692 participants were African Americans with genome-wide
association data available for analysis. The 1692 African Americans
ESP samples include 845 from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI)
study (The Women’s Health Initiative Study Group, 1998) as part of
the WHI Sequencing Project (WHISP), and a total of 847 including
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC; Muntaner et al., 1998)
(N:282), Jackson Heart Study (JHS; Taylor et al., 2005) (N:366),
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; Bild et al., 2002)
(N: 146) and Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
(CARDIA; Friedman et al., 1988) (N :53) as part of HeartGO. Most
WHISP and HeartGO participants were selected on the basis of primary
phenotypes for ESP, which included extremes of body mass index, blood
pressure, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol, early onset myocar-
dial infarction (MI) cases and controls, ischemic stroke with either early
onset or positive family history. Approximately 15% of samples were
selected because of having non-missing data for a selected set of core
phenotypes, but were not ascertained based on trait values.

2.2 Exome Sequencing

Exome sequencing was performed at the University of Washington
(SeattleGO) and the Broad Institute (BroadGO). Initial quality control
(QC) on all samples involved sample quantiﬁcation (PicoGreen), con-
ﬁrmation of high-molecular weight DNA, ﬁngerprint genotyping and
sex determination. Samples were failed if total mass, concentration,
integrity of DNA or quality of preliminary genotyping data was too
low or sex typing was discordant. Following QC, 2ng of extracted
genomic DNA was subjected to shotgun library preparation and exome
capture as previously described (Tennessen et al., 2012).

2.2.1 Genotype Calling For read mapping and variant analysis, sam-
ples were aligned to a human reference (hgl9) using Burrows7Wheeler
Aligner (Li and Durbin, 2009). Variant detection and genotyping were
performed on both exomes and ﬂanking 50 bp of intronic sequence.

Typical mean coverage of the target was 6(P80><. Variant data for each
sample were formatted (variant call format) as ‘raw’ calls for all samples.
Filters considered the total read depth, the number of individuals with
coverage at the site, the fraction of variant reads in each heterozygote, the
ratio of forward and reverse strand reads carrying reference and variant
alleles and the average position of variant alleles along a read. Variant
calling was performed across all 6515 samples at the University of
Michigan (UMich). Only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that
passed the UMich support vector machine quality ﬁlter were retained for
analysis. Details were previously described (Fu et al., 2012).

2.2.2 Reference Panel Construction A reference panel of 2163 indi-
viduals (including the 1692 African Americans used in this study and 471
European Americans) was constructed. All of the 2163 individuals have
both Genome-wide association study (GWAS; Affymetrix 6.0) genotypes
and whole exome sequencing data. When combining the two sources of
data, a total of 375 024 bi-allelic autosomal SNPs with minor allele count
:4 (in the 2163 reference panel subjects) did not overlap with the 702 205
GWAS SNPs. There were 10130 SNPs that overlapped between ESP
and the 702205 GWAS markers. SNPs with concordance <95% were
removed (65 SNPs). For overlapping SNPs that passed this concordance
ﬁlter, GWAS genotype was retained for consistency with the target indi-
viduals. A total of 1077164 autosomal SNPs were included in the ref-
erence panel. These 1 077 164 markers were phased across all 2163
samples using BEAGLE v3.3.1 (Browning and Yu, 2009).

2.2.3 ESP ‘Extreme’ and ‘Normal’ Panel Construction The 1692
ESP African Americans were selected based on the following phenotypic
traits: (i) LDL (N 2254: 131 with high LDL and 123 with low LDL),
(ii) blood pressure (N 2247: 132 with high blood pressure and 115 with
low blood pressure), (iii) body mass index (BMI, N: 609: 429 with high
BMI and 180 with normal to low BMI), (iv) early onset MI (EOMI,
N 2324: 39 EOMI cases and 285 EOMI controls), (v) stroke (N :40,
all cases) and (vi) random samples (N 2218). We constructed one ESP
‘Extreme’ panel and one ESP ‘Normal’ panel each with 853 individuals.
The ESP ‘Extreme’ panel included (i) 254 individuals with high/low LDL
(131 with high LDL and 123 with low LDL), (ii) 247 individuals with
high/low blood pressure (132 with high blood pressure and 115 with low
blood pressure), (iii) 40 stroke cases, (iv) 39 EOMI cases and (v) 273
individuals with high BMI. The ESP ‘Normal’ panel consists of 80%
individuals with ‘non-extreme’ phenotypes and 20% with extreme pheno-
types so as to better represent a population sample. Individuals with ‘non-
extreme’ phenotypes (N: 683) are from random sample, EOMI controls
and low BMI group. Individuals with extreme phenotypes (N: 170) are
from high (N: 85) and low LDL (N: 85) group.

2.2.4 The 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) The 1000 Genomes
Phasel data were downloaded from http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/yli/
mach/download/l000G.2012-03-14.html. Details regarding the gener-
ation of the data can be found in the Phase 1 article (The 1000
Genomes Project Consortium, 2012).

2.3 Target African Americans

2.3 .1 GWAS Data All of the 1661 target African Americans in this
study were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping platform as
part of the WHI SNP Health Association Resource study. Before phasing
and imputation, we removed Affymetrix 6.0 SNPs with genotype call
rates <90%, or Hardy7Weinberg exact test (Wigginton et al., 2005)
P<10’6 or MAF <1%. QC details were described previously (Auer
et al., 2012; Reiner et al., 2011).

2.3 .2 M etabochip data All of the 1661 target African Americans in
this study were also genotyped using the Metabochip (V oight et al., 2012)
in an attempt to generalize genetic effects across racial groups by the

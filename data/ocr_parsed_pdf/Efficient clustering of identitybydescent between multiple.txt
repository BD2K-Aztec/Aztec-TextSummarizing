In this study, we evaluate DASH using population samples with
thousands of individuals in a range of different parameters set—
tings. We do not evaluate IBD—Groupon v1.1 because it required
too much memory (>12 Gb) when analyzing the simulated
datasets in this study.

In this work, we present the efﬁcient multiple—IBD (EMI) al—
gorithm to search for multiple—IBD clusters along sliding win—
dows in the genome. In contrast to DASH, which builds clusters
from a largest connected component and iteratively divides it
into smaller clusters by a minimum cut algorithm, EMI takes
an agglomerative approach. It builds each cluster from initial
seed haplotypes and recursively adds qualifying haplotypes to
expand the cluster. High computational efﬁciency is ensured by
the use of priority queues. We evaluate our results based on
coalescence simulations. Coalescence simulations allow the inves—
tigation of realistic scenarios while enabling determination of the
true multiple—IBD status. We compare the performance of EMI
and DASH with thousands of samples.

Although DASH, IBD—Groupon and EMI all use graph—based
clustering methods, there is an important difference in how clus—
ters are identiﬁed. IBD—Groupon uses an HMM to ﬁnd the most
likely maximal cliques within each chunk of genome so as to
resolve inconsistencies. Such a procedure only involves pruning
edges (an edge is a pairwise IBD segment), even though some—
times adding a few edges can not only resolve inconsistencies but
also recover missing pairwise IBD segments in the input. Both
EMI and DASH build clusters that are highly connected and
therefore can prune incorrect edges as well as add missing
edges. Missing edges should not be ignored, especially for short
segments, as the state—of—the—art pairwise IBD detection methods
only achieve high power (e.g. 0.8) for IBD tracts longer than
2cM in SNP data (Browning and Browning, 2013a).

Detected IBD segments have many applications, one of which
is IBD mapping in association studies (Browning and
Thompson, 2012; Francks et al., 2010; Gusev et al., 2011; Lin
et al., 2013; Purcell et al., 2007). One can code the multiple—IBD
clusters as genetic markers and use them for association testing in
genome—wide association studies (GWAS).

GWAS have identified many common variants associated with
diseases, yet they have explained relatively little of the heritability
of complex diseases. Rare genetic variants, often deﬁned as vari—
ants with minor allele frequency (MAF) <1% ~ 5%, can play
important roles in complex diseases and traits (Schork et al.,
2009). It has been suggested that rare variants may contribute
to disease and thus partly explain the missing heritability (Eichler
et al., 2010). IBD mapping falls into the category of focusing
mainly on signals from rare variants because IBD detection
methods detect long shared segments that correspond to a rela—
tively short time to the common ancestor. Variants arising
shortly before the most recent common ancestor of a group of
IBD haplotypes will be correlated with the IBD group member—
ship; these variants, being recent, are rare. Studies have shown
that IBD mapping may have higher power than association ana—
lysis of SNP data when multiple rare causal variants are clustered
within a gene (Browning and Thompson, 2012).

A multiple—IBD cluster—based association test is essentially a
rare—variant association test. The frequency of each cluster is
determined by the number of haplotypes in that cluster, which
is often small because large IBD groups are rare, especially for

outbred populations. Standard methods used in GWAS evaluate
each variant individually with univariate statistics, such as the
CochraniArmitage test for trend, and are underpowered for rare
variants unless sample sizes or effect sizes are large (Li and Leal,
2009). Over the past few years, many group—wise association tests
have emerged as to overcome this limitation, including burden
tests (Madsen and Browning, 2009) and variance—component
tests (Wu et al., 2011). Burden tests are typically based on col—
lapsing or summarizing the rare variants within a region by a
single value, which is then tested for association with the trait.
However, a limitation for such methods is that they implicitly
assume that all rare variants inﬂuence the phenotype in the same
direction, which might not be true in real applications.
Alternatively, we can cast the problem in the framework of
linear mixed models with random effects and apply a global
score test for the null hypothesis that all the variance components
are 0. This can be conveniently tested with a variance—component
score test in the corresponding mixed model, which is known to
be a locally powerful test (Lin, 1997). Because most of our IBD
clusters to be tested are rare, we chose to use mixed models and
test for random effects of all the variants in a region. We chose to
use the sequence kernel association test (SKAT) (Wu et al., 2011)
for our analysis, as it provides a supervised ﬂexible regression
model to test for association between genetic variants (common
and rare) in a region. SKAT allows for adjustment for covariates
and has been shown to be powerful for most underlying hypoth—
eses concerning the relationship of variants and complex traits
(Ladouceur et al., 2012).

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

In this section, we ﬁrst describe the algorithm framework of EMI, and
then we describe the simulation framework for comparing and evaluating
the multiple-IBD clusters found by EMI and DASH. Finally, we describe
the real data to which we will apply IBD mapping.

2.1 Algorithm outline

EMI clusters pairwise IBD segments into multiple-IBD clusters with an
algorithm that is similar to one used in the systems biology domain for
fast clustering of biological networks such as proteiniprotein interaction
networks (Jiang and Singh, 2010). The predicted clusters can be used to
predict missing links in the network and to search for protein complexes
and functional modules.

Extending the algorithm to a genome-wide scale, EMI builds a graph
with nodes representing individual haplotypes and edges representing
IBD in the local region. The algorithm moves to the next region through
sliding windows. The term multiple-IBD cluster means a highly connected
subgraph where each haplotype in the graph is estimated to be IBD to all
the other haplotypes in the same subgraph.

Consider a genomic region that is divided into K consecutive windows
of length H. For each window wink, its left and right window boundary is
denoted as winkm and wink(R), and we have wink(R) = winkm + H. Given
N haploid copies of genome, the construction of multiple-IBD clusters is
fundamentally dependent on the presence of pairwise IBD segments,
which can be efﬁciently detected by existing tools such as Beagle
Reﬁned IBD (Browning and Browning, 2013a) and GERMLINE
(Gusev et al., 2009).

Assume a set S of pairwise IBD segments in this dataset, where each
element s e S has the form s=(i, j, l, r), i,j e 1,. . . , N and represents a
shared IBD segment between haplotypes i and j in the genomic interval
[l,r]. Note that the order of i and j does not matter, and s can also be

(iii) Repeating
The above procedure of seed selection and cluster expanding is
repeated for the remaining unclustered nodes until all nodes are
clustered or there is no edge left among the un-clustered nodes.

(iv) Implementation

The implementation uses priority queues. The ﬁrst priority queue is
used to pick the seed haplotype with the highest weighted degree.
Once a haplotype has been used in a cluster, it is removed from the
queue and the weighted degrees of all its neighbors are decreased
accordingly. The second priority queue is used for expanding clus-
ters. Each haplotype b adjacent to one of the haplotypes in cluster C
being built is included in the queue and is prioritized based on sup-
port (I), C). It is implemented in the Fibonacci heap and supports
insertion and key decrease, with a theoretical complexity of O (|V|
log(|V|)+ |E|) (Fredman and Tarjan, 1987)

2.1.2 M ultilocus clustering In application to genome-wide data,
EMI slides the local window along the genome and extends the single-
locus clustering to multilocus clustering.

The ﬁrst window wino is analyzed with the single-locus algorithm,
and we get an initial set of multiple-IBD clusters :10. When we move to
a new window wink+1 from the previous window wink, we use a modiﬁed
version of single-locus clustering that includes three steps.

(i) Dissolving of old clusters

For each pairwise IBD segment s = (i, j, l, r) that belongs to IBD
collection Sk but not SH], if its edge ei, j connects two nodes in a
cluster C, remove this edge and check the density of the updated
cluster C. Dissolve cluster C if the density is below a threshold.

(ii) Expanding and merging existing clusters.
For each unclustered node a, add it to an existing cluster C e in.
if support (a, C) using IBD segments in SH] is above a thresh-
old. If an IBD segment that belongs to SH, but not Sk, connects

two existing clusters Cm and C,, (Cm, C,, 6 71k), merge these two
clusters if the density of combined cluster is above the threshold.

(iii) Single-locus clustering
For the remaining nodes that are not included in any cluster,

create new clusters in window wink+1 with the single-locus
clustering.

2.1.3 Software implementation The above algorithm is implemented
in C++ and is freely available at http://cs.au.dk/~qianyuxx/EMI/

2.2 Evaluation of clusters

2.2.1 Data simulation The coalescent model with recombination de-
scribes genealogies of underlying chromosomes from unrelated individ-
uals (McVean and Cardin, 2005). We used the program MaCS (version
0.4f) (Chen et al., 2009) to simulate sequence data under the coalescent
model with recombination. Ten datasets were simulated; each consists of
4000 haplotypes spanning a lOMb region. The simulated recent effective
population size is 3000 individuals, whereas the ancient (before 5000 gen-
erations ago) population size is 24000 individuals. The mutation rate is
1.38 X 1078, and the recombination rates follow the HapMap recombin-
ation map for chromosome 20 (Frazer et al., 2007). The parameters for
MaCS were ‘4000 10000000 T -t 0.0001656 -r 0.00012 -h 1000 -R
chr20map -G 0.0 -eN 0.4167 8.0’. The simulation is designed to mimic
an isolated population such as that for the Northern Finland Birth
Cohort (NFBC) data, on which we conducted IBD mapping.

We then generated simulated SNP array data by thinning the sequence
data. All variants with MAF <2% were removed; ~3000 markers were
selected among the remaining variants in each 10 Mb region, with MAF

uniformly distributed between 2 and 50%. The number of variants
corresponds to a SNP density of 1 million SNPs genome wide.

The multiple-IBD clustering requires pairwise IBD as input, which we
generated using two different approaches. The ﬁrst one uses the thinned
SNP array data and applies to the standard GWAS settings, where SNP
data are often available. We use Beagle version 4 Reﬁned IBD (r1058) for
haplotype phasing and pairwise IBD detection. All the parameters were
left at their default values, i.e. ibdcm = 1.0 (the minimum length in
centiMorgans of reported IBD) and ibdlod = 3 (the minimum LOD
score for reported IBD).

The second approach uses sequencing data and evaluates the optimal
performance of multiple-IBD clustering when we have nearly perfect
power for pairwise IBD detection, even for IBD tracts as short as
0.2 cM. Two haplotypes are identical-by-state (IBS) if they are identical
within a region, and we treat all the pairwise IBS segments longer than
0.2 cM as pairwise IBD segments after removing variants with MAF
<0.25%. This frequency ﬁltering removes variants that arise from muta-
tion events since the most recent common ancestor. Using IBS to
approximate IBD tracts is, however, not applicable in real data due to
sequencing error and haplotype phasing error.

2.2.2 True IBD clusters The coalescent tree traces the ancestry of
sample chromosomes back in time until there is a single common ances-
tor. When recombination is involved, the ancestral relationship among
chromosomes is complicated. At any single position along the genome,
there is still a tree, but the trees at nearby positions may differ.

Multiple-IBD essentially means multiple haplotypes share a common
ancestor. In our simulated data, we deﬁne the true multiple-IBD cluster
as a cluster of haplotypes that share the same common ancestor across a
region of length Hlme. We choose to use Hlme=200 kb (approximately
equivalent to 0.2 cM) in the evaluation framework, which is also the
window size we used for IBD mapping. More speciﬁcally, within a
region T of size Hu‘ue, a multiple-IBD cluster Cu is deﬁned as any sub-
tree of the true coalescent trees, which contains all descendants of the root
of the sub-tree and spans this region without topology changes. Shorter
H",ue results in decreased performance for EMI and DASH, due to the
limitations of pairwise IBD resolution, while longer H".ue leads to too few
true multiple-IBD clusters, as recombination breaks down the IBD
signals.

2.2.3 Performance metrics The power and accuracy of resulting clus-
ters are measured by how well different methods recover the true under-
lying genealogy. The number of true IBD clusters C T,- in region T depends
on the local recombination rate as well as on the length of region T. As
any sub-tree (a true IBD cluster) of the coalescent tree also forms a true
IBD cluster, there is a hierarchy structure in the true multiple-IBD clus-
ters, and therefore evaluating how well the clustering algorithm works is
challenging.

2.2.4 Overlap measure Two overlap measurements, the Jaccard
measure (Jaccard) and the Precision-Recall (PR) measure, are widely
used in systems biology (Kelley and Ideker, 2005; Song and Singh,
2009) when there is a hierarchy structure in functional modules.
Jaccard: given two sets, the Jaccard similarity coefficient is deﬁned as
the size of the intersection over the size of the union. For each output

cluster C, its Jaccard value with a true IBD cluster CT,- is deﬁned as
1C0 Cnl
W U Cal
value over all true IBD clusters in region T.

PR: Similarly, for each cluster C and true IBD cluster CT,-, the PR
 The PR measure for cluster C is the

maximum of PR scores over all true IBD clusters CT,- in region T.

score is deﬁned as

2.2.5 Coverage measure Recall Rate (RR) is used to quantify how
many individuals are assigned to a correct cluster, with the following

deﬁnitions: (i) True Positive (TP) node: a node is called TP node if it
belongs to a cluster C, and there exists a true IBD cluster C T,- in region T,

such that   z 0.8. (ii) True node: any node in a true IBD cluster C T,-

is called a true node. The RR is deﬁned as the number of TP nodes
divided by number of true nodes. Note that the number of true nodes
is the union of nodes in all CT,-, and this can be less than the number of
haplotypes.

 

2.3 IBD mapping

2.3.1 Data set We ran EMI for multiple-IBD clustering in the NFBC
1966 GWAS data, downloaded from dbGaP (accession number
phs000276.v1.p1), and subsequently tested for association with low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which has shown a high level of
heritability in previous studies (Browning and Browning, 2013b). The
5402 individuals included in NFBC are drawn from genetically isolated
Finnish regions and thus have relatively more IBD than other popula-
tions. A standard GWAS analysis has been published, and multiple
genome-wide signiﬁcant common variants were found (Sabatti et al.,
2009).

Pairwise IBD detection was done as reported previously (Browning
and Browning, 2013b). On chromosome 1, IBD detection took 83h
with a minimum IBD length parameter of 1.0cM. Close relatives and
outlying individuals based on the value of the ﬁrst 20 eigenvectors were
removed. For LDL, we also excluded individuals who were pregnant, had
diabetes or were not fasting at the time of measurement. After data ﬁl-
tering, we were left with 4406 individuals.

2.3.2 Linear mixed model We ran EMI in this dataset with the best
parameters tuned in our simulation, including the cluster density cutoff
denmin and the sliding window size H. Each multiple-IBD cluster is con-
sidered as a variant, and the cluster frequency is therefore deﬁned as the
cluster size (number of haplotypes in this cluster) divided by the total
number of haplotypes, which is 8812 for 4406 individuals.

Because most of the multiple-IBD clusters are rare (with fre-
quency<0.01) and may have small effects on the trait, the standard
single variant test will be underpowered.

In contrast to the concept behind the single SNP test, we ﬁt the effects
of all clusters as a random effect in a linear mixed model. Consider the
linear model

yt = 010 + d/Xi + ﬂ/Gi + 6i

y,» denotes the phenotype for the ith subject, a: is a vector of fixed effects
and [f is a vector of random effects with mean 0. Xi = (Xil , X, , ..., Xm)
denotes the 15 covariates of sex, oral contraceptive use and the ﬁrst 10
eigenvectors. G,- = (Gi1,G,2, ...,G,»,), with G,-,~=0, 1, 2 represents the
number of haplotypes in cluster j for the ith subject for the p clusters
within the region. 6,» is an error term with mean 0 and variance of :72.
Testing association of p clusters with the trait corresponds to testing the
null hypothesis H): Var(ﬂ) = 0, which can be tested with a variance-com-
ponent score test. Such a test of non-zero variance in a linear mixed
model is implemented using the software SKAT (version 0.82) (Wu
et al., 2011) and was used in our analysis.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Performance of clustering in simulated data

In this section, we evaluate the performance of clustering with
different parameters, and we compare EMI and DASH, with
respect to the running time and accuracy of multiple—IBD clus—
ters. All the computation times in this study are from runs on a
single processor of a 2.4GHz computer. The clusters are evalu—
ated in terms of RR and PR (or Jaccard measure). RR measures

the proportion of haplotypes that are assigned to a correct clus—
ter, and it is similar to the deﬁnition of power in a hypothesis
test. PR or the Jaccard measure measures the accuracy of clus—
ters, which is an analog to 1 minus the type 1 error rate. Often a
higher power is preferred while keeping the type 1 error rate
under control in association tests. Similarly, in our application,
we prefer a higher RR while keeping the PR or Jaccard measure
above a certain level.

3.1.1 Grid search of parameters DASH has two versions ac—
cording to the documentation on the Web site (http://www.cs.
columbia.edu/~gusev/dash/). One version is DASH_cc, which is
parameter—free and does not apply dense—subgraph searching.
DASH_cc iteratively searches for all clusters without enforcing
a minimum density, e.g. den,,,,-,,=0, and thus it generates a few
large clusters that do not accurately approximate the true mul—
tiple—IBD clusters. The other version is DASH_adv, for which
the goal of ﬁnding dense subgraphs is similar and comparable
with EMI. In our experiments, DASH_adv also runs faster than
DASH_cc, so we used DASH_adv in the analysis. For simplicity,
we drop the subscript adv and refer to it as DASH in the
following.

Both DASH and EMI take two input parameters, denmin
(minimum density) and H (window length), but no previous
studies have shown which parameters should be recommended.
Using simulation data, we performed a grid search in the 2D
parameter space with denmin taking values of [0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7,
0.8] and H taking values of [100, 200 and 400 kb]. We generated
10 datasets as described in Section 2.2.1. From each dataset, 10
windows,200 kb in length, were chosen at random. Within each
window, we evaluated the quality of clusters by comparing them
with the true multiple clusters. The average results from all
100 windows are shown in Table 1. One can see that with dif—
ferent combinations of denmin and H, both DASH and EMI
have similar performance. However, a lower density cutoff,
such as 0.5, gives better results for both EMI and DASH. We
decided to use denminz 0.5 and H = 200 kb for further analysis,
where EMI reaches the highest RR and a high PR that is not
different from the highest average PR.

3.1.2 Comparison with DASH Two types of pairwise IBD seg—
ments are generated as input for EMI and DASH, as described
in Section 2.2.1, which we refer to as SNP data and IBS data,
respectively.

SNP data: Given thinned SNP data, we used Beagle Reﬁned
IBD to generate pairwise IBD segments, which are used as input
for multiple—IBD clustering afterward. The time and perform—
ance in 10 simulated datasets are shown in Table 2. Compared
with DASH, EMI has slightly lower accuracy in terms of the
Jaccard measure and PR, and slightly higher power in terms of
how many haplotypes are assigned to the correct cluster.

IBS data: It has been shown that most existing pairwise IBD
detection methods have lower power for short IBD segments
(e. g. shorter than 2 cM) given SNP data. Therefore, the perform—
ance of multiple—IBD clustering might be limited by the input of
pairwise IBD segments. To explore the optimal performance a
clustering method can achieve, we also generated pairwise IBS
segments from the sequencing data and used them as input for
the clustering. The results are shown in Table 2. As expected, the

ran SKAT for each permutation. We obtained the experiment—
wide distribution of minimal P—values over all loci from the per—
mutation replicates. The empirical P is deﬁned as the proportion
of minimal P values from permutations that are smaller than the
P—value on the original data in this region. The QQ plot shows
that the variance—component score test is anti—conservative. By
using empirical P—values, we not only adjust for multiple testing
but also correct for the anti—conservative nature of the original
P—values.

The empirical experiment—wide P—value 0.05 corresponds to
a SKAT P—value of 1.13 x 10‘5 in this analysis. As shown in
Table 3, we found two loci, the APO cluster and the PCSK9
gene, that have an empirical P—value <0.05.

Sabatti et al. (2009) conducted standard GWAS analysis on
this dataset and reported six loci associated with LDL traits. The
APO cluster (MIM107730) was found with both standard
GWAS analysis (P—value 4.96e—8) and with our multiple—IBD
approach (P—value 4.52e—7). The signals around the APO cluster
span several windows.

The second strongest signal found in our study is located near
the PCSK9 (MIM 607786) gene, which is known to be involved
in regulation of LDL cholesterol. Previous studies suggested that
mutations in PCSK9 have a strong effect on LDL cholesterol
(Cohen et al., 2006). This association was ﬁrst reported in a
GWAS—based analysis for a variant of MAF 1% in a sample
of 8816 individuals (Kathiresan et al., 2008). In the NFBC data—
set, there are no SNPs in strong LD with the reported SNP, and
therefore the standard methods failed to report it. The associ—
ation with PCSK9 was also reported later by one of the largest
lipid meta—analyses to date with a sample size of >100 000 indi—
viduals of European descent (Teslovich et al., 2010) and a recent
GWAS of African Americans and Hispanic Americans (Coram
et al., 2013), which indicates that the signal we found is real.

It is worth mentioning that the third strongest signal we found
is chromosome 19 [11145302, 11225495 bp] (hg18), ~40 kb
downstream of the LDLR gene (MIM 606945). Although this
signal (P—value 8.22e_5) failed to show signiﬁcance after the mul—
tiple—testing correction, it was one of the loci reported by Sabatti
et al. (2009) and has been validated by many other GWAS with
larger sample sizes (Coram et al., 2013; Teslovich et al., 2010).

4 DISCUSSION

IBD haplotype sharing is useful for many applications, such as
imputation, improved accuracy in haplotype phasing, IBD

mapping and population genetic inference. Most existing meth—
ods for IBD detection only consider pairwise IBD, yet the
implementation and applications of multiple—IBD have not
been fully explored.

In this study, we developed EMI to detect IBD segments that
are shared by multiple individuals. Unlike the existing method
DASH, which searches for a highly connected graph by dividing
the big graph iteratively with a minimum cut algorithm, EMI is
implemented in an agglomerative manner and uses a heuristic
approach to greedily build clusters. Using efﬁcient data struc—
tures, EMI runs faster than DASH in application to genome—
wide data, with comparable performance. The theoretical time
complexity is hard to obtain because both DASH and EMI use
methods to reduce computational effort when moving across
sliding windows along the genome. However, our simulations
show that the difference in running time between EMI and
DASH becomes larger in a region with increased pairwise IBD
sharing, such as data from isolated populations.

The accuracy of inferred multiple—IBD clusters has not previ—
ously been evaluated. We used coalescent simulations to evaluate
the accuracy of resulting multiple—IBD clusters and found the op—
timal parameters for subsequent analysis. Although multiple—IBD
clusters are supposed to be highly connected, a density cutoff as
low as 0.5 has a fairly good performance. The best density cutoff
may depend on the pairwise IBD detection program, which has to
make a trade—off between power and type 1 error. For example, we
used Beagle Refined IBD for pairwise IBD detection, which has a
low type 1 error rate but also low power for short IBD segments.
Therefore, with Beagle Refined IBD, we use a low—density cutoff
so that we favor adding missing edges over cutting existing edges
from the pairwise IBD input. If we use GERMLINE, which has
weaker control of type 1 error to detect pairwise IBD segments,
a higher density cutoff may work better.

The speedup EMI achieves might seem to be insignificant in
the context of GWAS, where a lot more time is spent on the
upstream analysis. We have shown in our study that the simple
heuristic performs fairly well, but the results are not optimal and
can be further improved. For example, one can combine the
information of clusters of all windows into a global probabilistic
framework, similar to the idea behind IBD—Groupon. When it
requires many iterations to train an HMM, computational speed
matters. Therefore, our method is suitable for use in more
complicated models.

The concept of IBD mapping is not new, yet the approach used
here is different from the approaches used previously. Previous

IBD analyses have either used pairwise IBD and looked for dif—
ferences in IBD frequency between pairs of cases and pairs of
controls (Browning and Thompson, 2012; Purcell et al., 2007)
or have tested each multiple—IBD cluster individually (Gusev
et al., 2011). Here we use a variance components approach to
jointly test the multiple—IBD clusters in a region. The multiple—
IBD cluster approach is expected to be more powerful when
multiple low—frequency causal variants contribute to a trait.

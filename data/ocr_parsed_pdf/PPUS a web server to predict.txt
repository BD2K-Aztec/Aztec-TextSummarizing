Abstract

Motivation: Pseudouridine (‘1’), catalyzed by pseudouridine synthase (PUS), is the most abundant
RNA modification and has important cellular functions. Developing an algorithm to identify ‘1’ sites
is an important work. And it is better if the algorithm could assign which PUS modifies the ‘1’ sites.
Here, we developed PPUS (http://lyh.pkmu.cn/ppus/), the first web server to predict PUS—specific ‘1’
sites. PPUS employed support vector machine as the classifier and used nucleotides around ‘1’
sites as the features. Currently, PPUS could accurately predict new ‘1’ sites for PUS1, PUS4 and
PUS7 in yeast and PUS4 in human. PPUS is well designed and friendly to user.

Availability and Implementation: Our web server is available freely for non—commercial purposes

1 Introduction

Pseudouridine (‘1’), the most abundant RNA modification, has im-
portant cellular functions. For example, ablation of rRNA ‘1’ modifi-
cation by CBFS deletion in S. cerezrisae is lethal (Jiang et (11., 1993;
Zebarjadian et (11., 1999), and mutation of human PUSl leads to
mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia (Fujiwara and
Harigae, 2013). Identifying ‘1’ sites is certain an important work.

‘1’ was known present in different categories of non-coding
RNAs such as tRNAs, rRNAs and snRNA (Ge and Yu, 2013).
Recently, using newly developed ‘wP-seq (Psi-seq or Pseudo-seq)
methods, three works for the first time revealed that ‘1’ is also pre-
sent in mRNA (Carlile et (11., 2014; Lovejoy et (11., 2014; Schwartz
et (11., 2014). ‘1’ is catalyzed by pseudouridine synthase (PUS), and
different ‘1’ sites are catalyzed by different PUSs (Schwartz et (11.,
2014). However, to our knowledge, there is only one tool de-
veloped for prediction of ‘1’ sites in tRNA (Panwar and Raghava,
2014). No tool is available to predict ‘1’ sites in mRNA and other
categories of RNAs, not mention predicting which PUS modifies
the ‘1’ sites.

In this work, using PUS-specific ‘1’ sites found in recent works
(Carlile et (11., 2014; Schwartz et (11., 2014), we developed an

algorithm to predict PUS-specific ‘1’ sites. The algorithm could ac-
curately predict ‘1’ sites modified by PUSl, PUS4 and PUS7 in yeast
and PUS4 in human. Any RNA sequence can be used as input.
Finally, we implemented the algorithm in our web server PPUS.
PPUS is well designed and friendly to user.

2 Methods

2.1 Data source

Using newly developed ‘wP-seq methods, many ‘1’ sites and the PUSs
that modified them were identified in mRNA, tRNA, snoRNA and
rRNA in recent works (Carlile et (11., 2014; Schwartz et (11., 2014).
We downloaded data from both works and put all ‘1’ sites modified
by a certain PUS together, regardless of the RNA category. To train
classifiers, these ‘1’ sites were defined as gold standard positive sam-
ples. Corresponding to the positives, gold standard negatives were
gotten by randomly choosing equal number of ‘U’ sites from the re-
maining ‘U’s of the same sequences. The number of gold standard
positive samples for each PUS was listed in Table 1. These data
could be downloaded from website: http://lyh.pkmu.cn/ppus/data.
html. To avoid sampling bias, we sampled gold standard negative

dataset 100 times, and then combined each negative dataset with the
positives to train the classifier.

2.2 Support vector machine

The classification model for predicting ‘1' sites was based on support
vector machine. The software LIBSVM3.20 (Chang, 2011) was em—
ployed, in which a radial basis function (REF) was chosen as the ker—
nel function. The default values of parameter c and g were used.
LIBSVM outputs a posterior probability for each prediction to re—
flect its reliability (Kwok, 1999). The larger the posterior probability
is for a site, the more likely the site could be modified to ‘1'. To
make it easy to display in web server, the posterior probability was
converted to M—score by Equation (1). The M—score is an integer be—
tween 5 and 10.

M—score : floor (posterior probability * 10) (1)

2.3 Classifier evaluation

To evaluate performance of support vector machine (SVM), 5—fold
cross validation was adopted. In each round, 20% of the samples
were left out as the test set and the remaining as the training set. As
in previous work (Li et al., 2010), precision, recall and F1 were used
to evaluate the classifier. Of the sites predicted as ‘1' sites, the num—
bers of true positives (TP) and false negatives (FN) were counted. Of
the genes predicted as non—‘1' sites, the numbers of true negatives
(TN) and false positives (FP) were also counted. Then the precision,
recall and F1 score were calculated as

TP TP
TP+FP’ TP+FN’

i 2 * Precision * Recall

Precision : Recall : F1

_ Precision + Recall

Precision is the fraction of true positives in the predicted positives,
whereas recall is the fraction of gold standard positives that are pre—
dicted as true positives. F1 is used to evaluate the overall perform—
ance of a classifier. Receiver operating characteristic curve is
another measure often used for classifier evaluation (Liu et al.,
2014a,b, 2015), thus we also compute area under curve (AUC) in
this work. Because negative datasets were gotten by 100 random
samplings, the medians of precisions, recalls, F15 and AUCs of the
100 training results were used (Table 1).

2.4 Feature selection
We used a sliding window strategy to get nucleotides around the ‘1'
sites as classification features. The window was in the form of

‘L‘PR’, where ‘L’ and ‘R’ represented 0—10 nt at the left and right
side of ‘1' site, respectively. To generate fixed window length, a
dummy ‘X’ nucleotide was added to sequence terminals if needed.
As in previous work (Panwar and Raghava, 2014), we used binary
approach and represented A, C, G, U and X nucleotides with
{1,0,0,0,0}, {0,1,0,0,0}, {0,0,1,0,0}, {0,0,0,1,0} and {0,0,0,0,1}, re—
spectively. To get best performance for the classifier, we optimized
the window length (‘L’ and ‘R’) and listed them in Table 1.

2.5 Web server

The web server was run on Linux. Programs were written in PHP
(Hypertext Preprocessor). PPUS is freely available at http://lyh.
pkmu.cn/ppus/.

3 Results

As described in methods, ‘1' sites and the PUSs that modified them
were gotten from recent works (Carlile et al., 2014; Schwartz et al.,
2014). First, we wanted to test whether it was possible to develop an
algorithm to predict ‘1' sites if exclude the information of which PUS
modified the sites. We put all known 464 yeast ‘1' sites together as
gold standard positives, and got equal number of negatives by ran—
dom sampling. Unfortunately, as shown in Table 1, the median
precision, recall, F1 and AUC were 0.64, 0.60, 0.62 and 0.62,
respectively. The performance was poor, showing that if excluding
PUS—specific modification information, it was hard to distinguish ‘1'
sites from non—‘1' sites.

Second, it was reported that PUS1, PUS4, PUS7 recognized ‘A‘P’,
‘GU‘PCNANYCY’ and ‘UG‘PAG’, respectively (Lovejoy et al.,
2014). Thus, we wanted to know whether it was possible to distin—
guish ‘1' sites catalyzed by a certain PUS from non—‘1' sites.
Fortunately, as shown in Table 1, the classifier performed excellent
on PUS1, PUS4 and PUS7 in yeast, and PUS4 in human, with median
F1 : 0.77, 0.78, 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. However, it performed
poorly on PUS2, PUS3 and CBF5 in yeast, and DKC1 in human,
with median F1 : 0.58, 0.63, 0.58 and 0.60, respectively. This
might because the feature nucleotides were not found. In this work,
no RNA category information was used for classifier training, so the
classifiers should be RNA category insensitive. In other words, any
RNA sequence can be used as input.

Third, we validated the yeast and human PUS4 classifiers with
independent datasets. As shown in Table 1, there were 55 and 56
positive samples for yeast and human PUS4 synthases, respectively.
To test the yeast PUS4 classifier, we used the human PUS4 ‘1' sites as
an independent dataset, and finally found that 52 of the 56 ‘1' sites
can be correctly predicted. Similarly, we used the yeast ‘1' sites as an
independent dataset to test the human PUS4 classifier and found
that 39 of the 55 yeast ‘1' sites can be correctly predicted. Both re—
sults showed that the classifiers were efficient.

In conclusion, we for the first time developed an algorithm to ef—
ficiently predict PUS—specific ‘1' sites. We implemented the algorithm
in our web server PPUS. We think PPUS will be an important tool
for biologist in the field.

Abstract

Motivation: RNA sequencing enables allele—specific expression (ASE) studies that complement
standard genotype expression studies for common variants and, importantly, also allow measur—
ing the regulatory impact of rare variants. The Genotype—Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is col—
lecting RNA—seq data on multiple tissues of a same set of individuals and novel methods are
required for the analysis 0fthese data.

Results: We present a statistical method to compare different patterns of ASE across tissues and to
classify genetic variants according to their impact on the tissue—wide expression profile. We focus
on strong ASE effects that we are expecting to see for protein—truncating variants, but our method
can also be adjusted for other types of ASE effects. We illustrate the method with a real data ex—
ample on a tissue—wide expression profile of a variant causal for lipoid proteinosis, and with a
simulation study to assess our method more generally.

1 Introduction

Advancements in sequencing technologies are enabling unprece-
dented possibilities to study the transcriptome (Montgomery et (11.,
2010; Pickrell et (11., 2010). In RNA-sequencing studies, it is possible
to distinguish between transcripts from the two haplotypes of an
individual using heterozygous sites. This approach, called allele-
specific expression (ASE) analysis, allows an alternative way to
quantify sis-regulatory variation, complementary to eQTL analysis.

In addition, ASE has been utilized to analyze transcriptome effects
of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) triggered by predicted loss-
of-function variants (Lappalainen et (11., 2013; MacArthur et (11.,
2012; Montgomery et (11., 2011).

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is establishing
a resource database and tissue bank for the scientific community to
study the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression
in human tissues (GTEX—Consortium, 2013), with an aim to

interpret GWAS findings for translational research. The project is
analyzing gene expression from various perspectives, including tran—
script structure, expression quantity and diversity, eQTLs, and ASE
differences. Furthermore, as medical genetics pursues exploration of
rare variants, insights gained from the study of DNA and RNA
sequencing data in the GTEx project will become important for
functional interpretation of rare variants (Rivas et al., 2011, 2013;
Zuk et al., 2014).

To date, some methods have been proposed for the analysis of
ASE data, but these methods largely focus on a single tissue (Degner
et al., 2009; Ronald et al., 2005; Sun, 2012; Zhang et al., 2009) al—
though some could be applied also to multiple tissues (Skelly et al.,
2011). The multi—tissue aspect is important for interpreting disease
association findings (Grundberg et al., 2012; McCarroll et al., 2008)
since eQTL and early ASE studies suggest widespread tissue—specific
effects of cis—regulatory variants (Dimas et al., 2009; Gutierrez—
Arcelus et al., 2013). Currently, more sophisticated methods for
cross—tissue eQTL analysis are emerging (Flutre et al., 2013).
However, eQTL analysis requires large sample sizes, while ASE ana—
lyses can be conducted with significantly smaller datasets.

In this article, we present novel statistical methods for analyzing
ASE patterns from RNA—seq data across multiple tissues. Our main
motivation is phenomena such as NMD that can lead to a substan—
tial imbalance of transcripts from the two alleles (Fig. S37 in
Lappalainen et al., 2013) and can vary considerably between cell
types (Linde et al., 2007). From a statistical point of view, an advan—
tage of prominent ASE is that it can be detected even with a single
individual and with as small a read count as 10. (See Middle panel
of Fig. 4 for an example dataset.)

We address three main questions:

° In which tissues does a heterozygous site show ASE?

° Which tissues show similar ASE effects at the site studied?

° What proportion of a certain class of variants, such as protein
truncating variants (PTV), show ASE in all tissues, only in some
tissues, or in no tissues?

For the first question, a standard frequentist version of the bino—
mial test is commonly used. However, an interpretation of such a
test depends on factors like the read count and simultaneous analysis
of multiple tissues is very challenging. Hence, we require that our
statistical framework allow a simultaneous comparison between sev—
eral cross—tissue models for observed data. For example, we want to
weigh relative support of the model where all tissues show ASE to
the models where only a single tissue shows ASE and to the null
model where none of the tissues show ASE. For this purpose, we
adopt a Bayesian model comparison framework. Among its favor—
able properties are natural ways to compare models with differing
number of parameters and to fully account for the amount of avail—
able data when evaluating relative support of the models.

2 Methods

2.1 Grouped tissue model

We consider RNA—seq read counts overlapping a particular genomic
position from multiple tissues of one individual who is heterozygous
at that position. (See Section 4 and Supplementary Information
for extensions to multiple sites and individuals.) For tissue
5 : 1,  ,T, let 3/51 and ysz be the number of reads supporting
the reference and non—reference allele, respectively, and let
n5 : 3151 + 3152. We classify the tissues into three groups: no ASE (N),
moderate ASE (M) and strong ASE (8) and denote the group of

tissue 5 by v, E {N,M,S}. Motivation for introducing a separate
group for strong ASE is to identify the variants with the most ex—
treme ASE effects. Such effects require careful checking for possible
biases in the data (Degner et al., 2009; Panousis et al., 2014) and
have been seen, for example, among PTVs that exhibit a whole spec—
trum from none to complete ASE (Fig. S37 in Lappalainen et al.,
2013; Kukurba et al., 2014). For each group G E {N,M, 8}, we de—
note the proportion of the transcripts with the reference allele by
0(G). We use a binomial sampling model for the data conditional on
the group indicators:

9’51le NBin(n570(Vs)) (1)

Possible expression states of the tissues differ in the prior assump—
tions about parameters  We use the following priors (Fig. 1) to
describe different groups:

0W) ~ Beta(2000, 2000)

1 1

Wm) M ZBeta(36, 12) + ZBeta(12, 36)
1 1

0(5) ~ ZBeta(80, 1) + ZBetaﬂ. 80)

Under no ASE model N both alleles are expressed (almost) equally
and hence 0(N) % 0.5. As in Skelly et al. (2011), our N model
allows small deviations from the exact point value of 0.5 to be ro—
bust against some technical measurement bias (Fig. S28 in
Lappalainen et al., 2013) as well as very small ASE effects that are
not a main focus in this study. The parameters for Beta distributions
have been chosen in a way that clearly separates the three groups
from each other (Fig. 1) and thus gives an informative framework to
classify the tissues into three groups In supplementary information,
we further discuss the prior specification, extensions to truncated
priors and independence across tissues and a restriction to only one
ASE group. Our implementation allows user to easily modify the
prior parameters as well as use one—sided versions of the prior distri—
butions instead of the two—sided versions used in our simulation ex—
periments. For example, when studying NMD, we may require that
the reference allele is expressed more strongly, and hence consider
only the one—sided ASE states. Conversely, the two—sided ASE states
are tailored for the situations where we do not want to make an as—
sumption about which allele might be dominating. This is useful, for
example, when studying imprinting.

Conﬁgurations. For fixed prior distributions, the model space consists
of 3T configurations represented by V : (V1, . . . ,y-r) vector where
each tissue—specific indicator y, E {N, M, 8

We partition the space of configurations into five ASE states:

NOASE : {7) foralls: VS : N}

MODASE : {Vi foralls: VS : M}

SNGASE : {7) for alls : VS : 8}

HETO : {Vi exists,t: VS : Nand y, 9E N}

HET1 : {Vi exists,t: VS 9E y, and forallu : y“ 9E N},

where the states represent configurations for no ASE (NOASE),
moderate ASE (MODASE), strong ASE (SNGASE), heterogeneity
with at least one tissue showing no ASE (HETO) and heterogeneity
with all tissues showing some ASE (HET1). We also consider a tis—
sue—specific sub state of the heterogeneity states:

TIS_SPE : {5) exist5,t: VS 9E y, and for allu 9E t: y“ : VS}.

To do probabilistic comparison between the states we need to
define prior probabilities for each state. We do this by defining prior
for each configuration in a way which depends on its distance from
homogeneity. We define a distance a'(7) for each configuration 7 as
the smallest number of tissues whose group indicators need to be
changed in order to turn 7 into a homogeneous configuration (either
NOASE, MODASE or SNGASE). Formally, dﬁ) : T—
max{ZN, 2M, [5}, where ZN, [M and is are the number of tissues that V
assigns to N, M and 8, respectively. In particular, the configur—
ations with a' : 0 are the three homogeneous configurations and the
configurations with a' : 1 form the set TIS_SPE.

We specify the total prior probability for each possible value of a'
: 0, . . . ,T — 17/3) and then distribute it equally among the config—
urations with the same distance. This prior allows us to easily imple—
ment the idea that among the vast space of configurations we favor
a priori the parsimonious ones, i.e. those where many tissues are
similar. Our prior distribution extends the one recently used for
multi—tissue eQTL setting (Flutre et al., 2013) to the case of more
than two expression states. In the results reported in this work, we
have set a prior mass of 0.75 to a': 0 (i.e. 0.25 for each of NOASE,
MODASE and SNGASE) and the remaining 0.25 has been divided
equally among all possible values of a' : 1,  ,T— l'T/3l. This
choice was made because it gives an equal prior weight for the four
main patterns of ASE: three homogeneous states and general hetero—
geneity. If a previous estimate of configuration probabilities were
available, it could be utilized instead.

2.2 Multi—Iocus grouped tissue model

For settings where many variants are available for a joint analysis,
we extend grouped tissue model (GTM) to a hierarchical multi—locus
grouped tissue model (GTM’F) that learns from the data the
proportion of variants belonging to each of the five states,
it : (nN,nM,ns,nHo,nH1), and thus avoids the need to fix prior
probabilities of the states. Our default prior for the proportions is

7'1: ~ Dirichlet(1,1,1,1,1).

We describe the technical details of GTM”r and compare it to GTM
in Supplementary Information.

2.3 Computation

We use a standard Gibbs sampler to explore the posterior
distribution of the configuration indicators 7 under GTM (see
Supplementary Information for details).

The basic building block for model comparison is the Bayes fac—
tor between configuration V and the NOASE state

7 7 PM?)

where y : (311,, .. . ,y—r,). Evaluation of BF(V) can be done analytic—
ally by using Beta—binomial likelihood separately for the numerator
and the denominator. Thus we can quickly evaluate the Bayes factor
for any particular configuration and compare even hundreds of con—
figurations. However, when the number of tissues is large (say
T> 10), the number of possible configurations grows too large to be
exhaustively evaluated (analogous to a problem with eQTLs in
Flutre et al., 2013). This becomes problematic in particular when as—
sessing heterogeneity (either HETO or HET1), which in principle
would require a consideration of all those groupings that assume dif—
ferences between some tissues. Therefore, we introduce an approxi—
mation that avoids enumerating all groupings when assessing
heterogeneity, by focusing on only configurations that are strongly
supported by the data. Thus we assume that the configurations with
a'> 1 that have not been visited by the Gibbs sampler and are not
among a few dozen top heterogeneity models defined by tissue—spe—
cific group membership probabilities, have negligible marginal like—
lihood and can be ignored. This leads to a lower bound for the
marginal likelihoods of the heterogeneity states. In practice, a com—
parison to the exact values for cases where exact values can be calcu—
lated (T310) shows that the lower bound is actually a good estimate
in most cases (see Section 3).

By combining the Bayes factors with the prior probabilities of
the states we have the posterior probabilities of the states.

2.4 Q—statistic for heterogeneity
We compare GTM to a standard heterogeneity measure (Cochran,
1950)

where (is : ysl/ns and 0 are the empirical proportion of the refer—
ence allele at tissue 5 and across all tissues, respectively. (If 31,1 : 0,
we set 3151 : 0.5 and ysz : n, — 0.5 to avoid numerical problems.)
The idea is that this measure increases with the heterogeneity of the
tissue—specific 0, parameters, and can thus be used as a measure of
heterogeneity. The Q—statistic is typically used for statistical testing
for heterogeneity rather than for quantifying the amount of hetero—
geneity, and is known to have low power when sample size is small
(Higgins et al., 2003). An empirical P—value of the Q—statistic is esti—
mated by simulating datasets where the number of tissues and reads
match with the observed data and where all tissues have the same
value for 05 : 0.

3 Results

We first assess performance of GTM on simulated data and compare
it with a standard heterogeneity measure. Second, we illustrate
GTM on a real data example taken from the GTEx project. Results
of GTM”r are presented in Supplementary Information.

Data simulation. For three values for the number of tissues (T25,
10, 30) and four values for the number of reads per each tissue
(n, : 10, 30,50,200, for all s), we simulated 1000 datasets for nine
scenarios given in Table 1. The reference allele read count for each
tissue 5 was sampled from Bin(ns, 05), where 0, is 0.5 for group N,
0.75 for group M and 0.99 for group 8.

confidence, which can be seen from their membership probabilities
being evenly split between the groups N and M.

The non—reference allele (T) at the SNV rs121909115 is one of
the known protein truncating mutations in ECM1 that in homozy—
gous carriers lead to lipoid proteinosis, also known as Urbach—
Wiethe disease (OMIM 247100; Hamada et al., 2003).
The symptoms of this disease include scarring and infiltration of skin
and mucosae (Hamada, 2002). Therefore, it is an interesting observa—
tion that in our data the observed allelic ratio of the nonsense muta—
tion is higher in the skin tissue than in several other tissue types.

The isoform view of the GTEx portal (2014—01—17, dbGaP
ph5000424.v4.p1) shows four isoforms for ECM1 of which only
one (ENST00000470432) does not annotate rs121909115 as stop—
gain variant. However, the relative abundance of this transcript
does not seem particularly high in skin tissue compared with the
other tissues. Another observation is that one of the remaining three
transcripts (ENST000003465 69) is expressed in only a few tissues.
These tissues include mucous membrane and skin tissue where
symptoms of lipoid proteinosis are seen.

4 Discussion

We have introduced a statistical framework to assess similarities
and differences in ASE between tissue types. A motivation for our
work comes from ongoing RNA—sequencing projects such as the
GTEx project (GTEX-Consortium, 2013) that generates data on up
to 30 tissue types per individual with read counts per tissue and per
site starting from around 10.

We have chosen a Bayesian approach because it leads to a con—
sistent probabilistic quantification of the support that the data pro—
vide for each of the competing models. We see this as an advantage
over a series of separate analyses, such as, for example, would be
needed by an approach that first assessed heterogeneity using the Q—
statistic and if no (statistically significant) heterogeneity was
observed, would further classify the dataset into one of the homoge—
neous states. Previously, two excellent studies on Bayesian models
for expression data have been published by Skelly et al. (2011) and
Flutre et al. (2013).

Skelly et al. (2011) consider a three—stage hierarchical model for
allele read counts from genome—wide RNA—seq data of one individ—
ual. They observe allele counts at each heterozygous SNV (1st level)
which are assigned to genes (2nd level) whose common properties
are controlled by genome—wide parameters (3rd level). Their model
would be directly applicable also to multi—tissue RNA—seq data where
tissue—specific allele counts replace SNV—specific allele counts and
sites replace genes at the second level of the model. Suppose, for ex—
ample, that we had multi—tissue RNA—seq data on a set of individuals
who are heterozygous for at least one PTV. The model of Skelly et al.
(2011) would produce posterior distribution on the global propor—
tion of the PTVs that show ASE in at least one tissue type, as well as
variant—specific posterior probability of ASE. However, it would not
give as refined characterization of ASE at each PTV as our hierarch—
ical model GTM”r (Supplementary Information) and it would not do
inference on tissue—specific group indicator parameters (VS) that allow
probabilistic model comparison between different patterns of ASE.

Flutre et al. (2013) developed a method for a joint eQTL analysis
across multiple tissues. They work with micro—array expression data
using a linear model that is not directly applicable to the datasets we
have in mind: read count data from several tissues of a single indi—
vidual. They use tissue—specific binary indicator parameters that tell
whether a variant is an eQTL in each tissue and introduce three

ways to assign prior probabilities to different configurations of the
indicators. Their ‘lite’ model gives positive prior on only those con—
figurations whose distance from homogeneity is at most 1. Their
‘BMA’ model is similar to what we have used in that the prior of a
configuration depends only on its distance from homogeneity and
that the total prior probability corresponding to each value of dis—
tance is the same. Finally, their most complex ‘BMA—HM’ model
treats the weights of the configurations as random variables and esti—
mates them across genes using a hierarchical model. Similar hier—
archical model, that would learn joint ASE patterns between tissues
by a simultaneous analysis of a set of genetic variants (e.g. PTVs) is
also an important topic for further development of our hierarchical
model GTM’“.

Even though hierarchical models, such as our GTM”r and those
of Skelly et al. (2011) and Flutre et al. (2013), are conceptually at—
tractive, we believe that GTM’s ability to analyze one PTV at a time
has its merits from a practical point of view: it is quick to run, easy
to understand and requires read count data on only one variant.

Heterogeneity measures. Our model assumes that all tissues in a
same group have the same reference allele read frequency 0. In prac—
tice, we expect that our model is robust to some heterogeneity
within each group, since the priors for different groups are so clearly
separable from each other (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 51). Our
main interest is to assign tissue types into (three) broad categories of
ASE, and consequently we call a dataset heterogeneous only if some
pair of tissues show fairly strong difference in the non—reference al—
lele frequency. Standard heterogeneity measures, such as Q, ask a
slightly different question of whether parameters 05 have exactly the
same value across the tissues. A frequentist answer to this latter
question is given by an empirical P—value of heterogeneity measures
Q or p(HEle) estimated under the null hypothesis that all tissues
have the same value for 0 parameter which is estimated from the
data. By this approach, heterogeneity P—values in the ECM1 ex—
ample of Figure 4 are 0.011 and 0.006 by using Q and p(HETO)y),
respectively, as a test statistic. While these P—values point to general
heterogeneity between the tissue types, our GTM analysis leads to
more detailed information considering the type of heterogeneity: we
see heterogeneity where at least one tissue type escapes ASE (our
HETO state).

Our heterogeneity probabilities are based on a lower bound of
the true marginal likelihoods of the heterogeneity states. We showed
that in a large majority of our datasets (with 10 tissues) the approxi—
mation is accurate, but the approximation may not always work as
well with larger number of tissues. Therefore, in addition to the het—
erogeneity probabilities, we also compute, for each pair of tissues, a
posterior expectation of the distance between them. Here we define
the distance between two tissues to be 0 if they belong to a same
group and 1 otherwise. Maximum of all pairwise distances gives an
indication whether there is heterogeneity between tissues. By further
defining the distance between the ASE groups M and 8 to be 0, we
have a measure for particular kind of heterogeneity (HETO) where
at least one tissue belongs to the no ASE group N.

4.1 Application of the method

Nonsense-mediated decay. We envisage that a primary application
of our method will be in analyzing NMD. PTVs are usually subject
to NMD, a cellular mechanism that detects premature termination
codons and prevents expression of truncated proteins. Integrated
genome and transcriptome sequencing studies in lymphoblastoid cell
lines have demonstrated that ASE can be used for testing variants
predicted to trigger NMD (Lappalainen et al., 2013; MacArthur

[310'sp2umoip105xo'sopeuHOJIItotq/ﬁdnq

Assessing ASE across multiple tissues

2503

 

et al., 2012; Montgomery et al., 2010, 2011). To test whether the
predicted NMD truly happens, we can use the one—sided ASE models
rather than the two—sided ones to explicitly require that an ASE sig—
nal is present only if the minor allele, and not the major allele, is
silenced. We applied the one—sided approach in our example analysis
ofa PTV in ECM1.

Imprinting. Genomic imprinting is a phenomenon where only an al—
lele inherited from the parent of a particular sex is expressed (Babak
et al., 2008). To assess imprinting for one tissue type one could con—
sider a common coding variant of the gene of interest in that tissue
across multiple heterozygous individuals. If the gene is imprinted,
then in about half of the individuals the allele 1 should be silenced,
because we expect that in about half of the individuals the allele 1 at
this locus is inherited from the mother and in the other half it origin—
ates from the father. We could extend our framework to such a case
by allowing each ASE group to be divided into two subgroups repre—
senting parental origin of the allele 1. If one of the subgroups had
proportion 0 of the reads from allele 1 then the corresponding pro—
portion for the other subgroup should be 1 — 0. We could model 0
with a Beta—prior as in our GTM model.

Modest ASE effects. An interesting application of ASE is in the study
of cis—regulatory variants in LD with coding variants. When regula—
tory variants have only modest effects (Dimas et al., 2009), we could
modify our prior on ASE states to reflect this (see Supplementary
Information section S8 and Fig. S6). With this approach we envision
that researchers are able to study the effect of cis—regulatory variants
on transcription across a broad range of tissues where the number of
samples per tissue may be limited. However, compared to strong
ASE effects, more modest effects require much larger read counts
per tissue and decrease the ratio between biological signal and pos—
sible technical noise (Degner et al., 2009).

Multiple individuals. Suppose we have RNA—seq data on same tissue
types from several individuals who are heterozygous at a particular
variant. We could first assess, for each tissue type, whether the indi—
viduals are heterogeneous in their ASE status. If there is no evident
heterogeneity, a simple approach is to combine the reads from the
same tissue type across the individuals before analyzing the data
across the tissues. A more refined model that accounts for possible
individual—specific effects that are shared across the tissues requires
further work.

5 Conclusion

We have presented GTM and its multi—site extension (GTM’F), to (i)
classify tissues into three groups at each site according to their ASE
patterns and (ii) classify the sites into five combined ASE states ac—
cording to their tissue—wide ASE profiles. We see major applications
of our approach in assessing homogeneity, heterogeneity and tissue
specificity across a group of genetic variants such as variants pre—
dicted to trigger NMD, variants in genes with evidence of imprint—
ing, or variants in LD with GWAS loci for a particular disease.

As an example, we presented an application of the method to
read count data from the GTEx project for one heterozygote carrier
of a premature truncating mutation (p.R53X, rs121909115) in the
ECM1 gene. For this variant, which in homozygous form is known
to cause lipoid proteinosis, we identified heterogeneous gene expres—
sion effects across tissues and evidence for a complete escape from
NMD in skin tissue.

The identification and characterization of ASE, in particular for
PTVs with a putative complete loss of function effect, will provide a
better understanding of the biological mechanisms that are involved
in transcriptional regulation and will improve our computational
models for annotating variants identified in case—control or clinical
genome sequencing studies.

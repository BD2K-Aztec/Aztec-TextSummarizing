Abstract

Summary: Chromothripsis is a single catastrophic event that can lead to massive genomic re—
arrangements confined to one or a few chromosomes. It provides an alternative paradigm in cancer
development and changes the conventional view that cancer develops in a stepwise progression.
The mechanisms underlying chromothripsis and their specific impact on tumorigenesis are still
poorly understood, and further examination of a large number of identified chromothripsis samples
is needed. Unfortunately, this data are difficult to access, as they are scattered across multiple publica—
tions, come in different formats and descriptions, or are hidden in figures and supplementary mater—
ials. To improve access to this data and promote meta—analysis, we developed ChromothripsisDB,
a manually curated database containing a unified description of all published chromothripsis cases
and relevant genomic aberrations. Currently, 423 chromothripsis samples representing 107 research
articles are included in our database. ChromothripsisDB represents an extraordinary resource for min—
ing the existing knowledge of chromothripsis, and will facilitate the identification of mechanisms
involved in this phenomenon.

1 Introduction . .
recent years Slnce It may reveal a new way that cancer genomes can

Chromothripsis is a single catastrophic event of massive chromosomal
rearrangements that has been described in a wide variety of diseases,
especially in cancer (Stephens et (11., 2011). In contrast to the widely
accepted model of gradual accumulation of genetic alterations during
cancer development, chromothripsis is supposed to be a newly dis—
covered paradigm in tumorigenesis (Stephens et (11., 2011). In brief,
one or several chromosomes are shattered into many different sized
fragments through a catastrophic event. Some of the fragments are
then randomly stitched back together to generate a derivative
chromosome, and the others are lost. This process may generate
DNA amplifications, deletions and chromosomal fusion events that
underpin chromosome evolution (Liu et (11., 2011; Rausch et (11.,
2012). Chromothripsis has received a growing amount of attention in

evolve. However, the mechanisms leading to this event are not yet
fully characterized. A meta—analysis based on a large number of chro—
mothripsis samples is needed to uncover more about the phenom—
enon, which would substantially enhance our understanding of tumor
initiation and progression (Cai et (11., 2014; Kim et (11., 2013).
Unfortunately, due to the overall low incidence of chromothripsis
(occurs in only 2—3% of all cancers) (Stephens et (11., 2011), most
studies reported a relatively small number of chromothripsis cases.
Moreover, the relevant data acquisition is a cumbersome process,
since they are scattered in different parts of various publications and
are heterogeneous in their contents and formats.

To address this problem, we created ChromothripsisDB, which is a
manually curated database that catalogs all published chromothripsis

articles and samples. In the current release, ChromothripsisDB includes
data and results from 107 publications covering 423 cases. DNA copy
number aberrations (CNAs), structural variations (SVs) and clinical
data were curated and normalized into standardized formats. To the
best of the authors’ knowledge, ChromothripsisDB is the first database
dedicated to processing and visualizing chromothripsis data. It can fa—
cilitate future research to identify key features of this event and eluci—
date the underlying molecular mechanisms.

2 Methods

Our literature searches up to November 25, 2015, yielded 812 pub—
lications, which contained the keyword ‘chromothripsis’ in the title,
abstract or full text. All full papers were screened for eligibility and
classified into three categories according to their contents: Review
and Opinion, Methodology, and Research. The Review and
Opinion category included literature reviews, comments and reports
of innovations. The publications categorized as methodology were
articles concerning new theories, algorithms or softvvares for chro—
mothripsis identification. The research articles containing experi—
mental data were the primary data source for ChromothripsisDB.
The following three criteria were applied to ensure selection of eli—
gible samples: (i) the sample had to be explicitly declared as chromo—
thripsis by the authors; (ii) the clinical diagnosis and pathology of
the sample must be clearly recognized; (iii) the sample had to be as—
signed a specific case ID or can be traced back to the original publi—
cation. For each case, CNAs, SVs, relevant genes, genome assembly
version and clinical information were extracted from the main text,
tables, figures and supplementary materials, if available.

3 Results

ChromothripsisDB contains data from all published studies that
screening for chromothripsis events (Supplementary Table S1).
Currently, it includes 423 cases manually curated from 107 research
articles on two species: human and mouse. These data represent 52
disease types, of which ~90% are cancers. Besides malignant
tumors, congenital abnormalities also account for a notable propor—
tion of the database (Supplementary Fig. S1). The CNA profiles and
SVs of chromothripsis cases were identified by next generation
sequencing, array comparative genomic hybridization or single nu—
cleotide polymorphism arrays.

3.1 Data browsing

The data—browsing interface allows researchers to browse the database
by studies. Clicking on the article title leads to a page that includes a
table with detailed information of the study and a visualization of
chromothripsis cases. For research articles, the table also provides
hyperlinks to download the curated data and access raw experimental
data (if available). Moreover, we extracted and normalized the defin—
ition of chromothripsis used in publications. Since this information is
given in various descriptions of different publications, we used three
features to represent chromothripsis criteria: (1) the minimum number
of close—by breakpoints; (2) the number of copy number states; (3) the
random joining of chromosome fragments. The detailed description
of data normalization can be found in Supplementary Material.
For each chromothripsis case, the published sample ID was used as the
case identifier in our database, which allows users to easily trace
it back to the original publication. If this information was not avail—
able, a unique identifier consisting of the PubMed ID and a case num—
ber was assigned. The relevant information of each case was extracted

from the publication, including pulverized chromosome IDs, detection
technology and platform, and so on. The ‘affected genes’ field contains
a hyperlink to the gene list page, which contains reported fusion genes
and rearranged genes. This page allows users to investigate each gene
in more detail and has hyperlinks to NCBI Gene and Entrez Gene.
Both the pulverized chromosome IDs and the affected genes were re—
corded for each individual case and consistent with the authors’ ori—
ginal interpretations. Furthermore, ChromothripsisDB provides a
graphical summary of genomic aberrations in an idiogram of chromo—
somes (Fig. 1A), and SVs and CNAs are illustrated using a Circos plot
(Fig. 1B).

3.2 Database querying
We designed a search page for researchers to easily explore and ana—
lyze data of interest. Users can interactively query the database for
specific disease types or affected genes. The ‘disease search’ interface
allows users to search by species, detection technology and disease
type. All fields support multiple selections, and the field content
changes dynamically according to the user’s selection. A query from
the search page returns a summary table and a visualization of the re—
sults. The table provides an overview of the query inputs and outputs,
and includes a link to download the tabular data. The figures below
the table represent statistical analysis of the results. The bar plot dis—
plays the distribution of pulverized chromosomes across the genome
(Fig. 1C). The difference of chromosomal pulverization patterns may
suggest the possibility of different mechanisms underlying chromo—
thripsis phenomenon in various cancer types. For example, we
searched the database for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, respectively. We observed a high prevalence of
chromosome 21 pulverization in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, while
chronic lymphocytic leukemia showed a high frequency of chromo—
some 9 and 13 shattering (Supplementary Fig. S2). The differential
distribution of pulverized chromosomes is an indicator for a disease—
related selection of specific genomic rearrangements, and may reveal
different cancer associated genes and oncogenesis processes in these
two leukemias. More examples can be found in Supplementary
Material. The pie chart shows the percentage distribution of samples

among the queried disease types (Fig. 1D). In addition, the result page
contains the summarized information and visualization of each
chromothripsis case. In the ‘gene search’ interface, the users can query
the database for common affected genes between two disease
types, or for specific genes in particular diseases. Three Boolean
search operators (AND, OR, NOT) are available in the drop—down
options box. The resulting view will list the qualified genes and
related annotations.

4 Conclusion

ChromothripsisDB is the first repository providing convenient public
access to chromothripsis data. We curated and integrated hundreds of
chromothripsis samples from the published literature into the data—
base. We will continue to update our database every 2 months with
newly published data. It represents an invaluable resource for the
community and will assist in the meta—analysis of chromothripsis
phenomenon.

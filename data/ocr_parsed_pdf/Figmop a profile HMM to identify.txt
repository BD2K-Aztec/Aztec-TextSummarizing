3 RESULTS
3.1 Validation

Our original motivation for developing Figmop was to ﬁnd the
CYP genes in nematode genome assemblies. A total of 530 nema-
tode CYP genes from Caenorhabdilis species and Prislionchus
paciﬁcus were collected and an architecture of 13 MEME-derived
motifs was generated (Fig. 1A). This pattern of motifs was then
used by Figmop to search the genome assembly of Drosophila
melanogasler, where it returned all of the 85 deﬁned CYP genes,
as well as two probable pseudogenes (results not shown).

We then used Figmop to search the current genome assembly
of the parasitic nematode Hammrlus (project ID PRJEB506,
version CAVP000000000.1; Laing el 61]., 2013) and found 28
regions (e.g. Fig. 1B). However, all of the published gene
model predictions for these likely CYP genes were truncated or
fragmented (e. g. Fig. 1C). Further inspection revealed that all of
the expected sequence motifs for this CYP were present in the
genome (Fig. 1B), but were not identified as coding sequence by
the gene prediction software. This was also found to be the case
for the rest of the 28 putative CYP genes.

We do not discount the possibility that the disparity between
Figmop and the Hammrlus gene models may be because of
Figmop detecting pseudogenes, but this is unlikely to be the
case for all 28 regions. We have also observed a similar disparity
in the genomes of the parasitic nematodes Ascaris suum, Brugia
malayi and Slrongyloides ram" (data not shown).

3.2 Comparison with BLAST

A common approach to find a gene of interest in a genome in the
absence of gene models is to compile a set of known homologous
proteins, and run TBLASTN (version 2.2.27) against the gen-
omic sequence, accepting those high-scoring segment pairs
(HSPs) that satisfy an E-value threshold (Camacho el 61].,
2009). When searching a whole genome a small E-value should
be used to avoid false positives; lE-40 might be suitable in this
case. At this threshold, only 4 of the 28 regions found by Figmop
were matched by one or more HSPs, but there were an additional
seven HSPs that, following manual inspection, were probably
false positives, as the genomic regions contained no evidence of
the CYP pattern described previously. The E-value threshold
had to be relaxed to lE-10 before all 28 regions were found by
at least one HSP, at which point, there were an additional 432
HSPs that were likely false positives. A reciprocal BLAST
approach was used to improve the speciﬁcity, as described
in the Supplementary Information. Using this approach,
TBLASTN still required an E-value threshold of lE-10 before
it could detect all 28 putative CYP regions, though it still
returned eight false positives. Even at this very relaxed threshold,

Fig. 1. Figmop in action: improving a CYP gene model. The coloured
bars represent sequence motifs identified by MAST. (a) shows the pattern
of motifs common to all CYP genes, while (C) shows one of the
fragmented gene models identified by AUGUSTUS. (b) shows the
corresponding genomic region from (c), where the bottom indicators
map the previously predicted coding regions and the top indicators
map the CYP pattern from (a) as found by Figmop

many of the CYP regions were matched only by a single HSP
(Supplementary Fig. S2). A threshold of lE-25 was required to
exclude all false positives, though at this point only 11 of the 28
putative CYP regions were returned. One Hamlorlus scaffold
was shown to contain five putative CYPs by Figmop. A detailed
investigation of the TBLASTN results on this scaffold is
described in the Supplementary Information.

4 CONCLUSION

We have created Figmop, a software that uses a pHMM to com-
pare the motif patterns of a gene family against a test genome.
We have used it for the manual curation of several large diver-
gent gene families and for these cases, found it to be preferable to
BLAST in sensitivity and specificity, but mostly in terms of ease
of use and time.

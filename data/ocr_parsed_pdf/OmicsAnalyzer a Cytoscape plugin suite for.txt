based network analysis that (i) integrates hetero-omics data for
one or more species; (ii) performs statistical tests on the integrated
datasets; and (iii) visualizes results in a network context.
Availability: Implemented in Java, OmicsAnalyzer runs with
Cytoscape 2.6 and 2.7. Binaries, documentation and video
walkthroughs are freely available at http://vrac.iastate.edu/~jlv/
omicsanalyzer/

1 INTRODUCTION

The widespread use of omics-related biotechnologies has led to
many heterogeneous omics datasets. Software packages facilitate
the interpretation of omics data by using graph models where
nodes represent bio-elements and edges are bio-interactions between
these elements (Junker et al., 2006). However, the complexity
of biological systems and omics datasets require an integrative
analytical environment, which allows network manipulation at
different levels of detail, ﬂexible mappings between multiple omics
datasets coupled with data visualization and providing statistical
analysis and system simulation and visualization of resulting
analysis.

Cytoscape (Shannon et (11., 2003), an open source platform
software dedicated to network modeling in biology, provides a
highly ﬂexible environment for combining these elements. To meet
the above requirements, OmicsAnalyzer (i) manipulates networks
through interface connection with third-party plug-ins; (ii) maps
omics datasets within or across species and manages the datasets;
(iii) visualizes dynamic data using plots and animations; and
(iv) analyzes data using built-in statistical functions. The integration
of these key analysis ﬁmctionalities is a key building block for omics
data analysis in systems biology.

2 FUNCTIONALITY AND IMPLEMENTATION

The key features of OmicsAnalyzer are presented in three levels
(Fig. 1A), which function both independently as standalone tools
and communicate with each other to facilitate system-level analysis.
The levels are accessible as tabs in the Cytoscape control panel.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In the ﬁrst level, Data Collection and Preprocessing, there are two
modules: network generator and omics data integration. The network
generator enables the user to select subnetworks of interest with
respect to the network topology at different levels of detail such as
cycle, dense module or network motif. OmicsAnalyzer manipulates
the network by communicating with the Cytoscape platform or
third-part plug-ins. Speciﬁc functionality includes: (i) selection
of arbitrary subnetworks using a graphical editor provided by
Cytoscape; and (ii) deﬁning special interest networks based on
network motifs, cycles, modules, shortest paths determined by
existing Cytoscape plug-ins, such as SubgraphCreator. The Omics
data integration module is based on our previously developed
plug-in, OmicsViz (Xia and Dickerson, 2008). Data integration
is performed in two ways. First, omics datasets can be linked
using a common naming scheme between the data ﬁle and names
deﬁned in a user-selectable network attribute. Second, the user can
provide a mapping ﬁle of homologous or orthologous terms to allow
integration of omics datasets from different biotechnology platforms
with networks and mapping of omics datasets across species (for
detailed mapping rules, see Xia and Dickerson, 2008). The module
can also map multiple omics datasets to multiple networks by
selecting a dataset in under the data integration tab while viewing
a network. The integration allows users to compare omics data
across related networks to gain insights into biological dynamics
and function.

At the statistical level, OmicsAnalyzer offers a variety of
statistical analysis methods for imported omics datasets that are
mapped onto biochemical networks. Users can visually mine one
or more datasets integrated on a single network for relationships or
other patterns using our node scatter plots. It also provides a user-
deﬁned correlation coefﬁcient (Pearson’s, Kendall and Spearman’s
rank) selection criterion, which highlights and clusters nodes
meeting the criterion with respect to a reference node. The resulting
clusters are visually differentiated using colors automatically
assigned to corresponding reference nodes. For interactive analysis,
when one reference node is selected, its group (correlated nodes) is
highlighted.

The visualization level provides different methods to display
data and network. OmicsAnalyzer uses node view components to
describe data. For integrated visualization of multiple omics datasets
associated with one node, it produces several types of chart pictures
using the JFreeChart library (Gilbert and Morgner, 2007). Users can
switch between line, bar, spider web and pie chart styles to examine
the omics datasets simultaneously. To visualize the dynamics of time
series datasets, OmicsAnalyzer provides local and global animation

functions. In local mode, users can focus on speciﬁc set of nodes
where a line chart animation is shown in a panel. In global mode,
it uses node color to map measurement values at one time or
experimental condition. Users can control the play of animation and
investigate the entire network dynamics in omics datasets. Multiple
datasets can be read in at one time and the user can select which
ones they would like see in a scrollable list.

3 USAGE EXAMPLE

A brief usage example is shown Figure l, which uses an Escherichia
coli K-12 regulatory pathway as an input network (Covert et al.,
2004; Fig. l in Samal and Jain, 2008) and omics data (provided by
Ishii et (11., 2007) as imported data. In the network, a gene, cysB,
serves as a hub gene with high connectivity. Here, OmicsAnalyzer
created a subnetwork module which contains nodes with direct
links to cysB. In the subnetwork, three reference nodes are picked
out to ﬁnd the corresponding correlated group. After setting
Pearson’s correlation method and 0.86 as coefﬁcient threshold, the
resulting two groups are visualized in the network panel. Each
group is highlighted colorfully according to background color of
their reference node (Fig. 1B). For speciﬁc nodes of interest,
OmicsAnalyzer offers scatterplots to examine hidden relationships
in the datasets. At the lower left comer of Fig. 1B, two genes tauA
(b0365) and [(1143 (b0366), which might be related to gene cysN
(b2751) in the dataset are selected to apply the scatter plotting. User
can easily see the expression proﬁle of gene [(1143 is more related
to gene cysN than tauA. More details about the functionalities and
a tutorial of OmicsAnalyzer are available online. Figure 1C shows

visualizations of the associated transcriptomics data in three chart
styles in network context.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Analysis of biological networks requires assessing the
statistical significance of network-based predictions by using a
realistic null model. However, the existing network null model, switch
randomization, is unsuitable for metabolic networks, as it does not
include physical constraints and generates unrealistic reactions. We
present JMassBaIance, a tool for mass-balanced randomization and
analysis of metabolic networks. The tool allows efficient generation
of large sets of randomized networks under the physical constraint
of mass balance. In addition, various structural properties of the
original and randomized networks can be calculated, facilitating the
identification of the salient properties of metabolic networks with a
biologically meaningful null model.

Availability and Implementation: JMassBaIance is implemented in
Java and freely available on the web at

1 INTRODUCTION

Network-based studies of biological systems attempt to relate
topological properties to biological function. The ﬁrst step in
drawing this connection involves determining the network properties
which do not arise by chance. To this end, a network null model can
be used to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of network properties.

The common approach for determining the statistical signiﬁcance
of a given property is to determine a P-value based on the following
procedure: (i) determine the chosen property from an investigated
biological network; (ii) sample a large number of random networks
under biologically meaningful constraints; and (iii) estimate the
mean and variance of the property from the simulated networks
to calculate a z-score (with the corresponding P-value) under the
assumption of normal distribution.

Clearly, the signiﬁcance of a network property strongly
depends on the null model. The commonly used method, switch
randomization (Guimera et (11., 2007; Milo et (11., 2002; Sales-Pardo
et (11., 2007), does not account for physical constraints, and thus
generates unrealistic biochemical reactions (see Basler et (11., 2011,
for an example). Thus, it is questionable whether the signiﬁcance
determined by this generic randomization scheme helps to elucidate
the relation between network properties and biological functions.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Motivated by the lack of a biologically meaningful null model
for metabolic networks, we developed a method for randomizing
metabolic networks under the constraint of mass balance, and
analyzed its computational complexity and uniformity of sampling
(Basler et (11., 2011). Here, we present a tool which can be
run via a graphical user interface (GUI) or from the command
line, and implements mass-balanced randomization of metabolic
networks provided in one of three standard data formats: (i) BioCyc
(http://www.biocyc.org); (ii) Systems Biology Markup Language
(SBML, http://sbml.org); or (iii) a customizable text ﬁle format.

2 METHOD

A metabolic network is represented as a weighted directed bipartite graph
G=(VCU V,,E), where V6 is the set of compound nodes, V, the set
of reaction nodes, and EE (Vc >< V,)U(V, >< V6) is the set of weighted,
directed edges denoting stoichiometric substrate-reaction and product7
reaction relationships. For example, an edge (e, r) speciﬁes that compound
0 is a substrate of reaction r, while the stoichiometric coefﬁcient s” of c in
r is represented as the weight of (c, r).

A compound node is uniquely represented by a name, a compartment and
a mass vector, mo 6 N”, i.e. the vector representation of the compound 0 over
n chemical elements. For instance, when considering the six most abundant
elements in biological systems: carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N),
oxygen (0), phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S), then the mass vector of water
is 1111.120 2 (O, 2, 0, 1,0, 0) - (C,H,N, O,P, S)T. The set of considered chemical
elements can be speciﬁed in a conﬁguration ﬁle (see Reference Manual,
available online at http://mathbiol.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/massbalance/).

For a reaction r, rm denotes the set of substrates, and row the set of
products. A reaction node is uniquely represented by a name and its direction:
reversible reactions are represented by one reaction node for each direction,
r+ and r‘, where r17; = rag and rat =riz. A reaction is mass balanced, i.e.
chemically feasible with respect to the conservation of mass, if the sum of
its substrate atoms equals the sum of its product atoms:

The randomization procedure consists of a pro-calculation step, which
classiﬁes the compounds from the network according to their chemical sum
formula (see Basler at (11., 2011), followed by the actual randomization. The
pro-calculation is executed only once for all subsequent randomizations of
the same network, and renders the method applicable to large networks.
A network is randomized by replacing the substrates and products of
randomly chosen reactions by compounds from within the same network, and
choosing their stoichiometric coefﬁcients, such that Equation (1) is satisﬁed
(Fig. l). The polynomial-time algorithm generates randomized networks
uniformly at random and clearly outperforms switch randomization (see
Basler at (11., 2011, Supplementary Table S l).

3 APPLICATION

JMassBalance is written in Java and comes with all required
libraries. Hence, an installation is not required, and it can be used on
any operating system with installed Java (http://www.oracle.com).

The randomization procedure accepts network ﬁles in BioCyc,
SBML, or a customizable text format. Additional optional par-
ameters allow specifying whether unbalanced reactions in the
original network should be ﬁxed, whether compartments should
be considered, the randomization depth and probability, and the
number of randomized networks to generate. All calculations can
easily be parallelized by executing the program multiple times with
different network indices (see online Reference Manual). Switch
randomization is also implemented, and can be applied to compare
the results of the two null models.

In addition to randomization, the following structural properties
can be calculated for the original and randomized networks,
respectively, which allows to determine their statistical signiﬁcance
in a biologically meaningful context:

0 Average path length: the average number of reactions on the
shortest path between two compounds.

0 Clustering coefﬁcient: average fraction of mutually connected
neighbors of a node in the corresponding (unipartite)
metabolite—metabolite network.

0 Assortativity: correlation coefﬁcient of the in-/out-
degree of a node and the average in-/out-degree of its
predecessors/successors in the corresponding (unipartite)
metabolite—metabolite network.

0 n-cycles: the number of directed cycles of length n in the
corresponding (unipartite) metabolite—metabolite network.

0 Path: test whether the given compounds constitute a path.

0 Connectedness: test whether the given compounds are
connected via paths.

0 Transition degree: the number of possible mass-balanced
substitutions.

0 Local essentiality: the ratio of successor reactions affected by
the knockout of a reaction.

0 Reaction centrality: the ratio of reactions globally affected by
the knockout of a reaction.

0 Knockout set: the set of reactions globally affected by the
knockout of a given reaction.

0 Degree distribution: the compound degree distribution.
0 Weight distribution: the distribution of edge weights.

0 Scope size distribution (Handorf et (11., 2005): the distribution
of the number of compounds producible from a random set of
seed compounds of the given size.

0 Distribution of AQG (Mavrovouniotis, 1991): the distribution
of the standard Gibbs free energy change of reactions.

The randomized networks may be printed as stoichiometric matrices
or as text ﬁles, thus enabling subsequent investigations, such as
constraint-based analysis (Feist et (11., 2010).

4 CONCLUSION

JMassBalance is a ﬂexible and efﬁcient tool for assessing the
signiﬁcance of metabolic network properties through a biologically
meaningful null model. It can be used to determine the salient
structural properties of metabolic networks and to identify new
properties, which are statistically signiﬁcant and independent of
basic physical constraints. Thus, we believe the tool is useful for
the initial analysis of reconstructed metabolic networks, as well as
subsequent network-based research.

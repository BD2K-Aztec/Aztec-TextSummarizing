Abstract

Summary: The ability to experimentally determine molecular interactions on an almost proteome—
wide scale under different conditions is enabling researchers to move from static to dynamic net—
work analysis, uncovering new insights into how interaction networks are physically rewired in
response to different stimuli and in disease. Dynamic interaction data presents a special challenge
in network biology. Here, we present DyNet, a Cytoscape application that provides a range of func—
tionalities for the visualization, real—time synchronization and analysis of large multi—state dynamic
molecular interaction networks enabling users to quickly identify and analyze the most 'rewired’

nodes across many network states.

Availability and Implementation: DyNet is available at the Cytoscape (3.2+) App Store (http://apps.

1 Introduction

Network biology is a rapidly developing area of research, which rec—
ognizes that cellular processes are controlled and coordinated at
multiple different levels by tightly regulated molecular networks.
This cellular ‘interactome’ is a highly dynamic entity, dependent on
an array of temporal, spatial, cellular and environmental signals
(Barrios—Rodiles et (11., 2005; Przytycka et (11., 2010). Understanding
how molecular interaction networks change in their composition
and connectivity in response to these cellular cues is crucial to
understanding complex emergent phenotypes in health and disease
(Barabési et (11., 2011; Bowler et (11., 2015). Sahni et al. (2015), for
example have shown that two thirds of disease—associated alleles
perturb protein—protein interactions (PPIs). Until recently, most
studies investigating the dynamics of PPI networks inferred dynamic
network states through the integration of static maps of the interac—
tome with state—specific information, such as gene expression or gen—
etic interaction data (Fischer et (11., 2015; Will and Helms, 2015).
Fortunately, advances in Mass Spectrometry are now enabling

high—throughput studies that directly investigate PPI network dy—
namics (Ideker and Krogan, 2012). Recently, for example re—
searchers have mapped the Hippo signaling pathway PPI network
and revealed how changes in protein phosphorylation result in a sig—
nificant rewiring of the interactions between members of this path—
way (Couzens et (11., 2013). Dynamic interaction data presents a
special challenge in network visualization and current software tools
are limited in their ability to visualize and analyze this type of data.
The DynNetu/ork Cytoscape application (http://apps.cytoscape.org/
apps/dynnetwork), for example uses animation to visualize changes
in networks over time/conditions. While fun, this approach is of lim—
ited practical utility especially for larger or highly dynamic networks
and the user can quickly lose track of the nodes/edges of interest.
This approach also lacks statistical measures to support the detec—
tion and quantification of network rewiring. The kDDN approach
(Tian et (11., 2015) is more advanced statistically but lacks integra—
tion with advanced network visualization tools and is limited to the
comparative analysis of only two network states. Here, we present

DyNet, a Cytoscape application that provides a range of functional—
ities for the visualization and analysis of large multi—state dynamic
molecular interaction networks and the identification of the most
rewired nodes.

2 Approach

DyNet represents a dynamic network as a set of state graphs (one
for each condition, time—point, etc.) and provides a new Cytoscape
feature to import multiple graph files in an automated manner.
Once imported, the initial network layout (which can be chosen
from any Cytoscape layout algorithm), and any subsequent editing,
of each state graph is managed and synchronized in real—time via a
central reference network (constructed from the union of all states).
This means that corresponding nodes and edges will always be
located in the same relative positions in each graph view, even dur—
ing user editing (e.g. dragging, zooming, moving a node), thus mak—
ing it easier for a user to visually compare graph states and keep
track of the changes in nodes/edges of interest across large, many—
state dynamic networks. The central reference network also fulfils a
second role as a canvas for the visualization of comparative node/
edge statistics (see Fig. 1). DyNet provides two principal modes of
analysis; one for pairwise (N : 2) comparisons and the other for
comparisons of multiple (N > 2) network states. Each mode sup—
ports the visualization of node/edge changes, based on their pres—
ence/absence or the value of a selected numeric attribute (e.g. node
abundance, edge weight), across networks (Fig. 1). When comparing
numeric attributes between two networks (pairwise mode), DyNet
calculates the log fold—change of the attribute value. When compar—
ing more than two networks a different approach must be taken to
produce a summary statistic of node/edge rewiring. Here, we calcu—
late the normalized variance for the numeric attribute across all net—
works. In either case, the resulting score is used to highlight the
most variable nodes and edges on the central reference network,
using a color gradient, and added as an attribute in Cytoscape’s
table view. Additionally, we also define a rewiring metric, the D"—
score, to support the identification of the most rewired nodes in a
dynamic network or, more specifically, the most dynamic neighbor-
hoods, i.e. the induced sub—graph consisting of all nodes adjacent to
a given node. Node rewiring can be defined both in terms of changes
in the identity of interacting neighbors (e.g. protein A interacts with

 

different proteins under different conditions) and/or in terms of
changes in the edge weights for a node’s connections (e.g. quantita—
tive changes in the affinity of protein A and its interacting partners
over different conditions, detected, for example, using SILAC). A
dynamic network may be modeled as a weighted node adjacency
matrix that is then extended by a third dimension, S, to describe the
state—space, i.e. M(P, Q, S). In this model, the dynamic rewiring
score, Dn—score, of a node may be calculated based on the variance
of its corresponding row, M(p, Q, s), over the various network
states, S, relative to the mean (centroid, c), where the base dissimi—
larity measure (d) is the Euclidean distance (see Equation 1 and
Supplementary Fig. S1 for further details, including a simple worked
example). The Dn—score is defined as:

My.

d(x,-, 6)
D,,(NodeX) : 

._n

(1)

where the vector x,- represents the neighborhood M(p, Q,s,-) after
standardization. The Dn—score favors high degree nodes or hubs
(which often prove more interesting biologically) and a degree cor—
rected version is also provided. High scoring rewired nodes are high—
lighted on the central reference network and on each state graph, via
node color, and added as a new node attribute in Cytoscape’s table
view. DyNet also offers additional ancillary features such as the
Node Analyzer, which enables a chosen node neighborhood be
viewed in isolation both in the central reference network and across
all states. This is especially useful for untangling the dynamics of
large, densely connected, many—state networks. DyNet also has an
advanced filtering option and an alternative method to visualize dy—
namic edge behaviour in the form of an ‘edge—by—state’ heatmap and
associated dendrogram that can be viewed in parallel with the main
graph—based visualizations. DyNet is implemented as a cross—plat—
form Cytoscape app (3.2 and above) (http://apps.cytoscape.org/
apps/dynet).

To demonstrate DyNet’s performance we present two case stud—
ies. Couzens et al. (2013) recently mapped the Hippo signalling
pathway PPI network in the presence and absence of stimulation by
okadaic acid (OA). DyNet was used to visualize and analyze these
two states of the Hippo pathway network and to identify the most
rewired nodes (see Fig. 1 and Supplementary Information). DyNet
highlighted Lats2 (large tumor suppressor kinase2) as one of the

upon stimulation (0A); green edges are present only in the unstimulated network (DMSO); grey edges are present in both. DyNet highlights nodes which are

most rewired (more red : higher variation) via the Dn-score, see text. The LatsZ protein, for example, shows significant rewiring of its adjacent neighbours fol-

nodes that was notably rewired in the presence of 0A. In the ab—
sence of OA, Lats2 had 32 interacting partners. The majority (24)
were lost following stimulation with CA, while 6 new interactions
were gained. The authors of the original study suggested this rewir—
ing represented a shift from repressive interactions to those that pro—
mote LATS activity, such as MST1 and MST2. Interestingly, DyNet
also identified SAV1 (scaffolding protein salvador homolog 1) as
being notably rewired, which has also been shown to associate with
MST1 and MST2 to activate the Hippo signaling pathway (Harvey
et al., 2013). To showcase DyNet’s ability to handle larger, multi—
state networks we have also inferred a large—scale dynamic
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) pathway PPI network
across 47 different tissues (where each state network has 453 nodes
and 588 edges on average), see Supplementary Information. DyNet
took ~10 s to import all 47 tissue—specific networks, via its multiple
file import feature, and ~20 s to build and lay out the central refer—
ence network, all state networks and to identify the most rewired
nodes (16Gb RAM; Core i5). DyNet identified several known regu—
lators of EGFR signaling (EGFR, RAF1, GRB2) as being the most
rewired across tissues (Supplementary Information and Fig. S2). We
have also tested DyNet with a simulated dataset containing 100 net—
work states, with on average 1300 nodes and 2,200 edges per state,
which represents the approximate upper analysis limit.

3 Conclusion

DyNet introduces several tools and metrics for visualizing and ana—
lyzing node and edge rewiring within large—scale, many—state, dy—
namic molecular interaction networks. We believe DyNet will be
invaluable to researchers as they continue to generate large—scale
contextual interaction data and delve into the rewiring of the cell’s
dynamic interactome.

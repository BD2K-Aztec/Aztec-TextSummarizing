Abstract

Summary: The WebSTAR3D web server is a user—friendly online interface for the alignment of RNA
3D structures. The website takes as input two files, each of which can be in either PDB or mmCIF
format, containing the desired structures to align, via a PDB code or user upload. In return, the user
is presented with a visualization of the aligned structures in Jmol or JSmoI, along with the corres—
ponding sequence alignment, and the option to download the nucleotide mapping of the structures

and a PDB file containing the aligned, superimposed structures.
Availability and Implementation: The WebSTAR3D is available at http://rna.ucf.eduNVebSTAR3D.

1 Introduction

It is recently discovered that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are
involved in nearly every cellular process, including gene expression
and other aspects of cellular metabolism (Hannon et (11., 2006). As
ncRNAs are genetic end products, their functions are implicated pri—
marily by their secondary and tertiary structures. This has motivated
an increasing research interest in methods for the comparative ana—
lysis of RNA structures, as key evolutionary and functional relation—
ships betvveen RNA molecules can be inferred from their structural
alignments.

With the rapidly growing archive of RNA 3D structures in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB), numerous tools have been developed for
the alignment of their tertiary structures, such as SARA (Capriotti
and Marti—Renom, 2009), R3DAlign (Rahrig et (11., 2010) and
Lajolla (Bauer et (11., 2009). Typically, these tools utilize the com—
parison of base pairing interactions between molecules (e.g. SARA,
R3DAlign), or they encode key structural features of these mol—
ecules, such as RNA backbones and nucleotide torsion angles, as se—
quential information that can be further processed (e.g. Lajolla).

STAR3D implements an alternative approach that identifies the
consensus of stacks between two RNA molecules, and uses this in—
formation to constrain the alignment of loop regions (Ge and
Zhang, 2015). First, sub—stacks with similar 3D structures are identi—
fied and assembled into conserved stack pairs, from which a sparse
compatible graph is generated based on the secondary structure

relations and spatial distances. Then, a tree—like consensus structure
of the two molecules is generated by efficiently finding the maximal
clique in the compatible graph. Finally, loop regions between the
two molecules are ordered based on the consensus structure such
that a loop region from one RNA structure only needs to be com—
pared to its matching partner from the other structure. The stack
and loop alignments are then combined into the final result. This ap—
proach results in efficient RNA 3D structural alignment that
matches the precision of other state—of—the—art tools. Here, we pre—
sent the WebSTAR3D web server: a web interface for the alignment
of RNA 3D structures that provides the core functionality of
STAR3D, along with some additional features.

2 Methods

2.1 Implementation

The front—end of the webpage is implemented in HTML, Javascript
and JQuery (https://jquery.com). The alignment is computed by the
Java implementation of the STAR3D algorithm available at http://
genome.ucf.edu/STAR3D, modified to additionally accept mmCIF
files as input, accept user uploaded PDB/mmCIF files, and return the
sequence alignment corresponding to the structural alignment.
Communication between the program and the webpage (i.e. passing
input from the front—end to the Java implementation and returning
the resulting alignment back to the front—end) is handled with PHP.

E. Holzhauser et al.

 

The docking of aligned structures is visualized in Jmol or JSmol
(http://www.jmol.org), based on user preference.

Before aligning structures, STAR3D preprocesses PDB files with
base—pairing annotation using either MC—Annotate (Gendron et al.,
2001; Lemieux and Major, 2002) (for PDB inputs) or DSSR (Lu
et al., 2015) (for PDB and mmCIF inputs) and pseudo—knot removal
using RemovePseudoknots (Smit et al., 2008). Preprocessing is the
most time—consuming portion of the entire STAR3D procedure.
Also, the result of preprocessing for a particular PDB—chain pair can
be reused for any alignment containing that pair. Thus, to improve
runtime, the preprocessing for all parsable RNA PDB files (represen—
tative and class members) used in the v1.89 of non—redundant list of
RNA structures under a 4.0  resolution cutoff (Leontis and Zirbel,
2012) has been stored on the hosting server. The cache of prepro—
cessed PDB files will periodically be updated with new releases.

2.2 Input

Upon visiting the webpage, the user is presented with a form with
which to input a pair of PDB files encoding the desired RNA 3D
structures to align. For each structure, the user must provide a valid
PDB identification code or upload their own properly formatted
PDB or mmCIF file, along with a valid chain identifier for the mol—
ecule. The user must also specify the format (PDB or mmCIF) of the
inputs, along with a desired base—pair annotation method to be used
in the pipeline. When entering PDB codes into the form, the form
offers suggestions for the codes corresponding to the preprocessed
PDBs, along with suggestions for their available chain identifiers.
Finally, there is a drop—down form to modify the parameters of the
STAR3D algorithm. These include the dynamic programming par—
ameters for the nucleotide alignment of loop regions: gap open cost,
gap extension cost and match/mismatch scores, along with the min—
imum stack size to consider when searching for similar stacks be—
tween the two structures, and the root—mean—square distance cutoff
used for both stack and loop region alignments. The default param—
eter values have been empirically chosen. The STAR3D algorithm,
and how the aforementioned parameters are used within it, are
described in more detail in Ge and Zhang (2015).

2.3 Output

The user is presented with the sequence alignment corresponding to
the tertiary structure alignment, the secondary structure for each se—
quence in dot—bracket notation, a description of each structure and
alignment metrics. As Jmol/JSmol rendering can be time—consuming,
the user is presented with a visualization of the 3D docking of
aligned regions in Jmol or JSmol only after clicking a ‘Render
Docking’ button, giving the user faster access to the downloads. For
the structure alignment and sequence alignment, the first and second
structures are highlighted in red and blue, respectively, with aligned
regions appearing in a darker hue than the unaligned regions. The
user can download the alignment file generated by STAR3D, which
includes the mapping between the nucleotides of the two structures,
a PDB file containing the atomic coordinates of the superimposed
structures, as well as the sequence alignment. Additionally, the user
has the option to view just a portion of the aligned structures by spe—
cifying a continuous interval of interest for each structure, using
slider widgets at bottom of the page. An example of the resulting
page for the alignment of E.coli initiator tRNA (PDB: 3cw5, chain
A) and mouse tRNA(Sec) (PDB: 3rg5, chain A) is shown in Figure 1.

2.4 WebSTAR3D advantages

The primary advantages of WebSTAR3D stem from the algorithmic
approach of STAR3D. Because STAR3D avoids computationally ex—
pensive secondary structure comparisons, WebSTAR3D can per—
form very fast 3D structural alignment, even for RNAs that are
prohibitively large and/or non—homologous for other platforms,
without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Where many structural
alignment web servers redirect the user to an intermediary loading
page that notifies the user of the status of their query, where the user
may wait several minutes, STAR3D directly presents the user with
the results page. On average, the user needs only wait several se—
conds—in fact, the non—homologous alignment of the sarcin—ricin
motif (PDB: 483d, chain A) to the large 23S rRNA (PDB: 1qvg,
chain 0) only takes 7 seconds to compute and then render with Jmol.

3 Conclusion

As ncRNAs are involved in numerous cellular processes, and their
functions are implicated by their structures, there is a growing inter—
est in tools for the comparative analysis of RNA structures. For this
reason, we have presented a user—friendly web server tool for the ter—
tiary structure alignment of RNA molecules. Because the underlying
STAR3D algorithm takes a fundamentally different approach to

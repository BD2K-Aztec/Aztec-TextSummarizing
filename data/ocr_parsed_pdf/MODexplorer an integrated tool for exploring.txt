ABSTRACT

Summary: MODexplorer is an integrated tool aimed at exploring the
sequence, structural and functional diversity in protein families useful
in homology modeling and in analyzing protein families in general. It
takes as input either the sequence or the structure of a protein and
provides alignments with its homologs along with a variety of structural
and functional annotations through an interactive interface. The anno-
tations include sequence conservation, similarity scores, ligand-,
DNA- and RNA-binding sites, secondary structure, disorder, crystal-
lographic structure resolution and quality scores of models implied by
the alignments to the homologs of known structure.

MODexplorer can be used to analyze sequence and structural con-
servation among the structures of similar proteins, to find structures of
homologs solved in different conformational state or with different
ligands and to transfer functional annotations. Furthermore, if the
structure of the query is not known, MODexplorer can be used to
select the modeling templates taking all this information into account
and to build a comparative model.

1 INTRODUCTION

Exploring the sequence, structure and function relationships be-
tween a protein and its homologs is a powerful strategy to trans-
fer functional annotations such as, for example, ligand-binding
sites and/or to detect the existence of alternative conformational
states. Likewise, in homology modeling, a thorough survey of all
homologs with known structure often can lead to building much
better models than obtained by automatically selecting the clo-
sest homolog as a template.

Current tools either provide only a general overview of se-
quenceistructureifunction relationships [e. g. GeneSilico
Metaserver (Kurowski and Bujnicki, 2003) or MESSA (Cong
and Grishin, 2012)] or focus on selected aspects, such as

ligand-binding sites [e. g. firestar (Lopez et al., 2011)]. A platform
for the in-depth integrated analysis of the sequence, structure and
function relationships is still missing. Consequently, the informa-
tion contained in remote relationships may be missed or
exploited only through tedious procedures.

Here we describe MODexplorer, a web server that integrates
sequence analysis and structure comparison with functional an-
notations. It provides a more complete and detailed View of the
sequence, structural and functional diversity within and between
protein families than existing tools. If the structure of the query
protein is not known, it permits to select a template for
homology modeling and to automatically build the model.

2 TOOL DESCRIPTION

A snapshot of the user interface of MODexplorer is shown in
Figure 1. A detailed description of integrated software and data-
bases, along with the parameters and references, is included in
Supplementary Data and available on the server. MODexplorer
accepts as input a protein sequence, PDB code or PDB ﬁle.
MODexplorer then

0 Creates the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the query
protein family using HHblits (Remmert et al., 2012).

o Generates alignments to proteins of known structure using
HHSearch (deing, 2005) and the PDB database filtered at
70% sequence identity.

0 For every HHSearch hit, retrieves and aligns related PDB
chains, i.e. chains with a sequence similarity >70%. Such
‘redundant’ chains can be useful. For example, they might
have been solved in complex with different ligands, represent
alternative conformational states or have a better structural
quality.

0 Displays alignments to the HHSearch hits and their related
PDB chains both schematically with a BLAST-like bar dia-
gram and as multiple sequence alignments including query
and hit sequences, and their homologs.

o Graphically shows annotations on the alignments. The an-
notations include ligand- and DNA-/RNA-binding sites,
secondary structure (predicted for the query and calculated
for chains of known structures), disorder (predicted for the
sequence query and estimated by B-factor/missing residue
annotations for the structure query and known hit struc-
tures), HHSearch similarity scores and QMEAN (Benkert
et al., 2011) scores of models built based on the alignments.

Fig. 1. Snapshot of the MODexplorer interface in ‘Ligands’ display mode, where ligand-binding sites are marked on the alignments. The interface is
composed of three panels. The ﬁltering panel allows ﬁltering the hits by functional and structural annotations. The overview panel displays the hits as a
BLAST-like diagram. The detail View panel enables displaying alignment of the query to currently selected hit along with the MSAs of their families. In
this example (query: C-terminal domain of PMS2 protein), users can easily find that one of the structures (3KDK) related to one of the two top-scoring
templates (3KDG) contains metal ions associated with conserved motifs (see detail View panel)

0 Allows filtering of the hits based on the presence of nucleic
acids and other ligands in the structures, on the HHSearch
scores, the experimental technique used to solve the
structures and the crystallographic resolution.

0 Allows modeling of the query based on any selected align-
ment. Models are built using Modeller (Sali and Blundell,
1993) and evaluated using QMEAN.

0 Provides Visualization of structural superpositions of PDB
chains and model structures in Jmol (http://www.jmol.org/).

o Enables superposition of PDB chains based on pairwise
alignment inferred from the alignments to the query. This
is useful, for example, to verify if a low scoring hit has a
similar structure in the aligned region as a higher scoring
one.

o Allows the assessment and modiﬁcation of the alignments
Via our interactive alignment editor MODalign (Barbato
et al, 2012).

0 Provides management utilities such as eliminating the hits
and creating a ‘favorites’ list of relevant hits.

3 CONCLUSIONS

MODexplorer can be used both to explore the protein sequence,
structural and functional diversity and to help in template selec-
tion in homology modeling. Thanks to tight integration of
sequence, structure and function information, MODexplorer
provides a comprehensive overview of the features of the target
protein and of its homologs, helps in detecting remote homologs
and facilitates the selection of templates for modeling.

ABSTRACT

Summary: iMAT is an Integrative Metabolic Analysis Tool, enabling
the integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data with genome-
scale metabolic network models to predict enzymes’ metabolic flux,
based on the method previously described by Shlomi et al. The
prediction of metabolic fluxes based on high-throughput molecular
data sources could help to advance our understanding of cellular
metabolism, since current experimental approaches are limited to
measuring fluxes through merely a few dozen enzymes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Modern genomic sequencing technologies have enabled the rapid
reconstruction of metabolic networks, giving rise to more than
50 highly curated metabolic reconstructions published to date
(Oberhardt et (11., 2009), spanning all three domains of life including
Eukaryota, Bacteria and Archaea. Additional computational methods
to automatically reconstruct metabolic network models have
recently resulted in draft network reconstructions for 160 microbial
species (Henry et (11., 2010). Such reconstructed metabolic network
models have been commonly used for metabolic phenotype
prediction, metabolic engineering, studies of network evolution and
biomedical applications (Oberhardt et (11., 2009). These studies
employ various constraint-based modeling (CBM) methods to
analyze the network function by solely relying on simple physical—
Chemical constraints (Price et (11., 2004).

Utilizing gene and protein expression to predict metabolic ﬂux is
a Challenging task due to the complex mapping between the two.
Previous studies have found a strong qualitative correspondence
between gene expression and measured (Daran-Lapujade et (11.,
2004) as well as predicted (Famili et (11., 2003) metabolic ﬂuxes
in microbes. However, the correlation between expression and
metabolic ﬂux is generally moderate and in some cases signiﬁcant
transcriptional Changes do not reﬂect Changes in ﬂux, and vice-versa,

signiﬁcant Changes in measured ﬂux may not reﬂect transcriptional
Changes (Ovacik and Androulakis, 2008). These discrepancies may
result from post-transcriptional regulatory processes that effect the
actual levels of enzymes translated and from metabolic regulation,
representing the effect of metabolite concentrations on the actual
enzyme activity through allosteric and mass action effects (Rossell
et (11., 2006).

Several CBM methods for analyzing and predicting metabolic
ﬂux distributions based on gene expression data have been suggested
previously. The methods of Akesson et (11. (2004) and Becker and
Palsson (2008) use gene expression data to identify genes that
are absent or likely to be absent in certain contexts and search
for metabolic states that prevent (or minimize) the ﬂux through
the associated metabolic reactions. Shlomi et (11. (2008) consider
data on both lowly and highly expressed genes in a given context
as cues for the likelihood that their associated reactions carry
metabolic ﬂux, and employ constraint-based modeling (CBM) to
accumulate these cues into a global, consistent prediction of the
metabolic state. The latter method was shown to accurately predict
human tissue metabolism, based on tissue-speciﬁc gene and protein
expression data. Its application has demonstrated that in many
cases, the activity of genes responsible for metabolic diseases is
not directly manifested in enzyme-expression data, though can still
be correctly predicted by expression integration with the metabolic
network. The implementation of the method based on Shlomi et (11.
(2008) involves solving multiple, complex Mixed-Integer Linear
Programming (MILP) optimization problems, requiring extensive
parallel computing resources, and hence has not been readily
accessible for the research community since its publication.

Here, we present an integrative metabolic analysis tool (iMAT)
that is a web-based implementation based on the method of Shlomi
et (11. The new tool will serve the community by enabling the
prediction of the metabolic state of an organism in a speciﬁc
condition given pertaining gene and protein expression data. We
provide below a high-level description of the iMAT server with an
illustrative example of applying it to a toy model.

2 TOOL DESCRIPTION

The usage of iMAT is straightforward. The input is gene and/or
protein expression data for a certain organism. The output is
a visualization map of the organism’s metabolic state, showing
the most likely predicted metabolic ﬂuxes across its reactions.
iMAT supports the integration of ﬁlnctional data with an array of
different existing metabolic CBM models, including: (i) a highly
curated metabolic network model of human metabolism (accounting

for ~1500 genes) by Duarte et (11. (2007), enabling the prediction of
metabolic activity under various tissues and cell types; (ii) common
model organisms such as Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (accounting for ~1300 and ~800 genes, respectively);
(iii) an array of automatically reconstructed networks for 160
bacteria (Henry et (11., 2010) (for a list of supported organisms, see
the iMAT web site); and (iv) user submitted models in either SBML
or matlab format. For any of the organisms in this list, iMAT enables
the prediction of metabolic activity under various environmental and
genetic conditions.

The gene and/or protein expression data submitted to iMAT
should be in the form of discrete tri-valued expression states,
representing either low, moderate or high expression in the condition
studied. If continuous data is submitted, iMAT will perform
discretization automatically. Various parameters can be tuned to
control the discretization of the raw input values (see Section 2,
Supplementary Material).

Given the target species metabolic model and gene or protein
expression data, iMAT predicts a ﬂux activity state for each
reaction in the model, reﬂecting the presence or absence of its
associated metabolic ﬂux. For some of the reactions, the ﬂux activity
state can be uniquely determined to be active or inactive, with
associated conﬁdence estimations. For others, the activity state
cannot be uniquely determined because of potential alternative
ﬂux distributions with the same overall consistency with the
expression data due to isozymes or alternative pathways. In cases
where the predicted ﬂux activity of reactions deviates from the
given expression state of the corresponding enzyme-coding gene,
the corresponding gene is considered to be post-transcriptionally
up- or downregulated.

iMAT provides as output the predicted ﬂux activity state and the
corresponding conﬁdence values over all network reactions in both
tabular and network visualization forms. The network visualization
displays the relevant transcriptomic and proteomic data given as
input, as well as the predicted metabolic ﬂux, superimposed on top of
the organism’s metabolic network, employing the publicly available
Cytoscape software (Cline et (11., 2007). To ﬁirther facilitate the
interpretation of the predicted ﬂux activities, iMAT performs a
pathway enrichment analysis, reporting the signiﬁcant active and
inactive pathways comprising the metabolic proﬁle signature of the
biological experiment studied. In addition, iMAT reports predicted
post-transcriptionally up- and downregulated genes.

3 TOY MODEL EXAMPLE

We describe the application of iMAT on a small toy model (Fig. l).
The toy model is comprised of 10 metabolites and 13 reactions,
including 7 exchange reactions that enable the uptake of substrates
and the secretion of metabolic byproducts. The predicted ﬂux is
consistent with the expression high/low state of four of the ﬁve
reactions. One reaction (M6->M9) is predicted to be inactive though
its corresponding gene is highly expressed, reﬂecting the potential
effect of post-transcriptional regulation. Of the seven metabolites
that can be transported across the membrane boundary in the
toy model (Ml-3, M5, M7-9), iMAT predicts the uptake of one
metabolite (M1) and the secretion of two others (M7 and M8). The
reaction Ml->M4 is predicted to be active with low conﬁdence,
since an alternative ﬂux distribution through Ml->M10->M4 in

consistent with the input expression data. Reactions associated with highly,
lowly or moderately expressed genes are colored in green, red or black,

distributions) are marked with thick edges.

the expression data.

Abstract

Motivation: Network biology has emerged as a powerful tool to uncover the organizational proper—
ties of living systems through the application of graph theoretic approaches. However, due to limi—
tations in underlying data models and visualization software, knowledge relating to large molecular
assemblies and biologically active fragments is poorly represented.

Results: Here, we demonstrate a novel hypergraph implementation that better captures hierarchical
structures, using components of elastic fibers and chromatin modification as models. These reveal un—
precedented views of the biology of these systems, demonstrating the unique capacity of hypergraphs
to resolve overlaps and uncover new insights into the subfunctionalization of variant complexes.
Availability and implementation: Hyperscape is available as a web application at http://www.
compsysbio.org/hyperscape. Source code, examples and a tutorial are freely available under a

1 Introduction

Biological systems captured by protein—protein interaction (PPI) net—
works are typically represented as graphs in which proteins are pro—
jected as nodes connected by edges. Other graphs such as bi—partite,
compound and metagraphs have been used to visualize more complex
relationships (Hu et (11., 2007). However, overlapping complexes have
not been well supported because (i) the tracking of interaction data at
the level of biological assemblages is relatively new, for example al—
though the BioPAX pathway language supports the definition of such
assemblages, only MatrixDB (Chautard et (11., 2009, 2010) appears to
track interactions across hierarchies; and (ii) existing visualization
tools, such as Cytoscape (Shannon et (11., 2003) and VisANT (Hu
et (11., 2007), created to support simple graphs, have design consider—
ations preventing the display of overlapping clusters.

To overcome these limitations, hypergraphs have been proposed
as viable alternative to more meaningfully represent biological

relationships (Klamt et (11., 2009; Ritz et (11., 2014). A hypergraph is
a set V of vertices and a set of non—empty subsets of V, called
hyperedges. Despite their ability to better represent the complexity
inherent in many biological datasets, tools enabling the practical im—
plementation of hypergraphs on a wide scale have been lacking.

Here, we provide software to translate and render biomolecule
descriptions as hypergraphs and we demonstrate the usefulness of
hypergraph visualization in interpreting the organization of elastic
fibers, major constituents of large blood vessels and resolving over—
laps in a network of chromatin modification.

2 Implementation

Using an existing file format previously defined for the Cytoscape
plugin, CyoOG (Royer et (11., 2008) we wrote a custom Perl script
to map biomolecule definitions and interactions into a succinct

description of the graphic elements to be rendered (Supplementary
Methods). The BBL file format elegantly describes the necessary
graphical elements and relationships for hypergraphs in the form of
NODES, SETS (groups of nodes), IN relationships (describing hier—
archical relationships) and their EDGEs. We used the D3 javascript
library (http://www.d3js.org) to develop ‘Hyperscape’ as a proof—
of—concept, browser—based renderer. Because of our layering ap—
proach, nodes which are shared between multiple complexes do not
need to be duplicated as they do in compound graph implementa—
tions. In addition to circumventing such legacy constraints,
Hyperscape is able to recognize stoichiometric information in the
form of multiple IN relationships and correctly represent these by
adding additional instances of nodes. The features of this web—based
renderer can be explored using the data and tutorial provided
(in Supplementary Data File S1).

3 Results and discussion

To illustrate the differences in information that can be extracted from
hypergraph, compound graph and bi—partite graph representations of
the same underlying data; we used a subnetvvork consisting of elastic
fiber components and their neighbors (Supplementary Methods). A
bi—partite graph representation of this network (Supplementary Fig.
S1) contains numerous redundant edges as well as a lack of informa—
tion relating components, their members and their stoichiometry (see
also: Supplementary Results/Discussion). The corresponding com—
pound graph (Supplementary Fig. S2) addresses some of these issues
by grouping components into metanodes that encircle components.
Nesting these created further difficulties, however, as edges between
hierarchical levels were not supported.

Further, protein fragments were inappropriately represented.
COL1 8A1, for example, has no relevant elastic fiber interactions ex—
cept through its cleavage product, endostatin, a potent inhibitor of
endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis (Sertie et (11., 2000).
Overlap of components such as COL4A5 which appears here as two
variants of collagen IV (Supplementary Fig. S3), v2 (composed of
COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5) and v3 (composed of COL4A5

 

 

 

 

 

Fig. 1. The elastic fiber interactome and selected neighbors. Note overlapping
assemblies as well as an additional hyperedge (blue oval) depicting the inter-
action between collagen lV (various assemblies) and the laminin-1:nidogen-1
complex. Simple edges represent experimentally determined, physical inter
actions (Supplementary Methods). Neighbors were selected as needed to
connect all elastic fiber components (EFCs) into a single, connected subgraph
and expanded to include all additional components of multimers associated
with an EFC or nearest neighbor. A complete set of neighbors are included in
additional online material (Supplementary Figs 83—85)

and COL4A6), required that duplicate nodes be created to represent
each instance of the protein.

Our hypergraph (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S4) represents a
more intuitive approach that highlights here, several indications of
differential wiring. For example, collagen VIII v3 does not contain
COL8A1 and hence, unlike collagen VIII v1 and v2, does not inter—
act with ADAMTSL4, whereas collagen IV v1 interacts with
LOXL3 and carries a distinct payload of statins—canstatin and
arresten as opposed to tumstatin for collagen IV v3. This suggests
functionally relevant subfunctionalization of variant complexes via
differential inclusion of paralogous components. Together with
endorepellin (derived from HSPG2) and vastatin (derived from
COL8A1), these fragments suppress pathogenic angiogenesis but act
across a variety of target pathways affecting endothelial cell growth
and apoptosis (Pupa et (11., 2002; Sudhakar et (11., 2003).

As a further example, we applied Hyperscape to a network of
chromatin modification (CM) as described in Supplementary
(Supplementary Fig. S6 and Supplementary Results/Discussion).

4 Conclusion

With increasing interest in applying hypergraphs to study protein
complexes, metabolic pathways, regulatory and signaling networks
(Hu et (11., 2007; Klamt et (11., 2009; Ritz et (11., 2014) we believe
Hyperscape will find wide application in systems biology.

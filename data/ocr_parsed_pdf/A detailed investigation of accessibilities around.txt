ABSTRACT

Motivation: The importance of RNA sequence analysis has been
increasing since the discovery of various types of non-coding RNAs
transcribed in animal cells. Conventional RNA sequence analyses
have mainly focused on structured regions, which are stabilized by
the stacking energies acting on adjacent base pairs. On the other
hand, recent findings regarding the mechanisms of small interfering
RNAs (siRNAs) and transcription regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs)
indicate the importance of analyzing accessible regions where no
base pairs exist. So far, relatively few studies have investigated the
nature of such regions.

Results: We have conducted a detailed investigation of
accessibilities around the target sites of siRNAs and miRNAs.
We have exhaustively calculated the correlations between the
accessibilities around the target sites and the repression levels of
the corresponding mRNAs. We have computed the accessibilities
with an originally developed software package, called ‘Raccess’,
which computes the accessibility of all the segments of a fixed length
for a given RNA sequence when the maximal distance between
base pairs is limited to a fixed size W. We show that the computed
accessibilities are relatively insensitive to the choice of the maximal
span W. We have found that the efficacy of siRNAs depends
strongly on the accessibility of the very 3’-end of their binding
sites, which might reflect a target site recognition mechanism in the
RNA-induced silencing complex. We also show that the efficacy of
miRNAs has a similar dependence on the accessibilities, but some
miRNAs also show positive correlations between the efficacy and
the accessibilities in broad regions downstream of their putative
binding sites, which might imply that the downstream regions of the
target sites are bound by other proteins that allow the miRNAs to
implement their functions. We have also investigated the off-target
effects of an siRNA as a potential RNAi therapeutic. We show that
the off-target effects of the siRNA have similar correlations to the
miRNA repression, indicating that they are caused by the same
mechanism.

1 INTRODUCTION

The energy scales of the secondary structure formations of RNA
molecules are rather high compared with those of many biological
interactions and processes. For example, the free energy of a single
GC/CG stacking is 3.4 kcal/mol. This value is about half of the
7 kcal/mol of ATP hydrolysis ATP —> ADP+ PPi, which is the basic
energy unit of most biological processes, such as transcription and
translation. Therefore, the secondary structure can strongly inﬂuence
biological processes involving RNA molecules.

Recently, a few studies that measure the regulatory activities of
miRNAs and siRNAs have revealed the importance of accessibility
around the target regions to these functional RNAs (Kertesz et al.,
2007; Shao et al., 2007; Tafer et (11., 2008). An miRNA represses
the expression of its target mRNAs by recognizing the ‘seed’
sequences in the target genes, which are about 7 bp in length
and are complementary to the 5’-end 0f the miRNA sequence.
The repression will be inefﬁcient if the seed sequences are buried
within a strong secondary structure of the target mRNA so that
the corresponding RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) cannot
access them because of a high energy barrier (Kertesz et al., 2007).
An siRNA represses the expression of the target mRNA that has
the sequence complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA.
The accessibility around the target sites has also been shown to
inﬂuence the efﬁcacy of siRNAs (Gredell et al., 2008; Hofacker
and Tafer, 2010; Tafer et (11., 2008). Despite the importance of the
accessibility of interacting RNA molecules, there have been few
studies investigating the regions of RNA sequences that do not form
any base pairs (Bemhart et al., 2006; Busch et al., 2008; Chen et al.,
2009; Kertesz et al., 2007; Tafer et al., 2008).

In this article, we investigate the accessibilities around the (off-)
target sites of siRNAs and miRNAs. We deﬁne the accessibility

Target accessibility of siRNA and miRNA

where 80 is the set of all possible secondary structures of x, 8(sa)
is the set of all secondary structures that have no paired bases
in segment sa of sequence x, E(a,x)(kcal/mol) is the energy of
secondary structure a on x, which is calculated by the Turner energy
model (Mathews et al., 1999), R: l.9872>< 10_3(kcal/(mol-K))
is the gas constant and T=310.15K is the temperature. Since it
is known that the secondary structure model based on the Turner
energy parameters is less accurate for structures involving the distant
base pairs, it is natural to restrict the maximal span of the base pairs
to a ﬁxed value W. In this case, 8(sa) and 80 include only the
structures containing base pairs of span less than or equal to W.
If the dynamics of RNA molecules were completely governed by
the Turner energy model, then the conformation distribution of non-
interacting RNA molecules in solution would be represented by the
Boltzmann distribution. In this case, Pacc(sa) would represent the
probability that a single RNA molecule has accessible segment sa.

Recent studies have shown that the techniques that combine all
the possible secondary structures are highly effective in predicting
secondary structures (Ding and Lawrence, 1999, 2001, 2003; Ding
et al., 2005; Do et al., 2006; Hamada et al., 2009b; Kiryu et al.,
2007; Mathews, 2006). These studies have shown that the behavior
of RNA molecules is more accurately described by including
the probabilistic ﬂuctuation of secondary structures (Carvalho and
Lawrence, 2008; Ding and Lawrence, 2003; Hamada et al., 2009a).
Hence, we expect that Equation (1) more accurately deﬁnes the
accessible regions of real RNA molecules compared to deﬁning them
from a single predicted secondary structure.

To date, only a few programs can compute the accessibility
based on the energy model. Sfold (Ding and Lawrence, 2003; Ding
et al., 2004) computes the accessibilities using posterior sampling
techniques. The time complexity of the algorithm is (9(NW2+
MNW) where M represents the number of sampled structures.
Although sampling methods are very ﬂexible to compute various
types of expectation values, their results are subject to random
ﬂuctuations, and the error of the calculated probability values is at
least (1 /M). In particular, it is difﬁcult to compute small probability
values unless huge number of structures are sampled. As compared
to the sampling algorithms, dynamic programming (DP) algorithms
can take all the possible structures into account, and they can
accurately compute small probability values without increasing
computational costs. OligoWalk (Lu and Mathews, 2008a, b, C)
uses a version of McCaskill’s DP algorithm (McCaskill, 1990)
adapted to the cases where the RNA sequence are subject to
accessibility constraints. The time complexity is given by (9(N3).
Since (9(N3) time is prohibitive to apply to long mRNAs, it
cannot compute the accessibilities based on the global structures
as deﬁned in Equation (1) for them. Although it can use a sequence
window approach, the artiﬁcial window boundaries strongly affect
the accessibility values, as described in the ‘Dependence on
GC Composition’ subsection. RNAplfold (Bemhart et al., 2006)
computes the mean accessibilities averaged over sequence windows
of length S (WfoN) with complexities of (9(NS2) in time

and O(N+S2) in space. Such window averaging is a reasonable
approach for a genomic scan where the boundaries of potential
transcripts are unknown. However, to compute the accessibilities
[Equation (1)] for transcripts with validated boundaries, we need
to set S=N, which is again prohibitive in terms of complexity
for long RNA sequences. Furthermore, the current RNAplfold
implementation results in overﬂow errors when S is set to a few
thousand bases, because it uses a simple scaling method for the
multiplications of partial Boltzmann factors. We have, therefore,
developed a software package called ‘Raccess’, which calculates
exactly the accessibility of all the segments of a ﬁxed length for a
given RNA sequence. Raccess sums up the Boltzmann weights for
all the possible global structures with the constraint that the maximal
span of the base pairs is limited to a given size W. The computational
complexity is (9(NW2) in time and (9(N +W2) in space. Raccess
computes the inside and outside variables by using the logarithms
of Boltzmann factors, so it is robust to overﬂow errors and returns
correctly for sequences longer than N = 100 kb.

Using Raccess, we ﬁrst investigate the basic properties of the
accessibilities. We show how the accessibility depends on the GC
composition, the length of SH and the maximal span. We also show
that the computed accessibilities are relatively insensitive to the
Choice of the maximal span. We then apply Raccess to the mRNA
sequences targeted by siRNAs and miRNAs, and compare the
efﬁcacy of their regulatory activities with the accessibilities around
the target sites. As compared to the previous studies that investigated
the efﬁcacy—accessibility correlations with only limited patterns of
accessible segments (Kertesz et al., 2007; Lu and Mathews, 2008a;
Shao et al., 2007; Tafer et al., 2008), we computed the accessibilities
for the exhaustive patterns of the accessible segments. Figure 1
shows the comparison of the patterns of the accessible segments
considered in this paper and those in the previous studies. From
these exhaustive calculations, we have obtained several interesting
observations. In particular, we show that the efﬁcacy of siRNAs
depends strongly on the accessibility of the very 3’-end of their
binding sites, which might reﬂect the underlying mechanisms of
siRNA function. We also investigate the correlation between the
accessibility and the off-target effects of an siRNA for the ﬁrst time.
We show that the miRNA repression and the off-target effects of the
siRNA have a similar dependence on the accessibility.

2 ALGORITHMS AND IMPLEMENTATION

Both RNAplfold and Raccess compute the accessibilities based on the
Turner energy model (Mathews et al.. 1999). However. the algorithms
they are based on are rather different: RNAplfold uses a modiﬁcation of
McCaskill’s algorithm (McCaskill. 1990). whereas Raccess uses a type of
insideioutside algorithm associated with a deﬁned context-free grammar
(Kiryu et al. . 2008). Although McCaskill’s algorithm is essentially an inside7
outside algorithm. there is no symmetry between the inside and outside
variables and it is difﬁcult to apply the RNAplfold algorithm to other
stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs). Therefore. we begin by giving
an illustrative example to show how to derive the formula for computing the
accessibilities in the case of SCFG models. We describe how the algorithm
can be applied to the energy model in the subsequent section.

We ﬁrst introduce some notation to simplify the following discussion. The
maximal span W is deﬁned as the maximal distance between two sequence
positions for which we consider the possibility of base pair formation. The
access segment s” is the sequence segment for which we compute whether the
region is accessible or not in terms of secondary structure. The access position
x” is the middle position of access segment s”. and the access length 1,, is
the length of that segment. The accessibility P3660”) in Equation (1) is the
probability that there are no paired bases in the access segment s” in terms of
the Boltzmann distribution. In other words. it is the probability that the access
segment s” is thermodynamically accessible. The access energy AEaCCUa) =
—RTlog(Pacc(s,,)) is the thermodynamic work needed to dissociate all the
paired bases within the access segment s”. The partition function Z(x) is
obtained from the usual inside algorithm. Thus. we only derive the numerator
of Equation (1) in terms of the insideioutside variables below.

2.1 Accessibility formula for a SCFG

The SCFG model that we consider has ﬁve non-terminal states (S . P. L. R
and M). The transition rules of the SCFG are deﬁned as follows.

S—>L
P—>a<La>
L—>aL|M
R—>Ra|P
M—>MR|e

where e is the null terminal symbol. a is a terminal symbol corresponding to
an unpaired nucleotide and a< and a> are the respective terminal symbols
that correspond to the left and right base of a base pair. Furthermore. S
represents the start state. P represents the pair emitting state. L represents
the left emitting state. R the right emitting state and M represents an auxiliary
state to handle multifurcations of stems. To explain how this SCFG parses
secondary structures. we prepare some basic terms on the energy model. In
this model. any secondary structure decomposes an RNA sequence into one
or more k-loops enclosed by the backbone and hydrogen bonds of base pairs.
A k-loop with k > 0 denotes a loop which composed of a closing base pair.
k—l opening base pairs and zero or more unpaired bases. For example. a
one-loop is a hairpin loop. a two-loop is either stacked base pairs or a bulge
loop or an interior loop and a k-loop with k > 2 is called a multiloop. For
more detail about the loop model of secondary structures. please refer to
the Mfold manual (Zuker et al.. 1999). For each k-loop. all the k base pairs
are emitted by P —> L transitions. The leftmost segment of unpaired bases is
emitted by L —> L transitions. The other unpaired bases are emitted by R —> R
transitions. Each M —> MR transition represents the production of an opening
base pair and. possibly. ﬂanking unpaired bases on its right. Figure 2 shows
the parsing tree of a three-loop structure.

In the present case. the numerator of Equation (1) corresponds to the sum
of all the probabilities of the parse trees that emit the segment s” as unpaired
bases. To compute this. we need to enumerate all the state transition patterns
that emit a contiguous sequence of unpaired bases of length l,,. There are

only two such patterns which are given by
(L —> L)la and (R —> R)la

where (A —>A)” indicate n successive A —>A transitions. Hence. the sum
of all the parse trees that includes these transitions can be represented using
the inside a,(i,j) and outside ﬁ,,(i,j) variables:

25(1) represents the emission probability of state s at position i. and t(s —> s’)
represents the transition probability for transition s—> s’. We show these
formulas graphically in Figure 3. Therefore. the accessibility of s” is obtained
by dividing the sum of the above values by the partition function Z(x):

Target accessibility of siRNA and miRNA

 

We note that whether or not the accessibility has such simple expression
strongly depends on the grammar structure. For example. if we add to
the model a transition R—>L. then the transitions. L —>L—>L. L —>
R—>L—>L. and L—>R—>R—>R—>L—>R—>L all emit three
contiguous unpaired bases as left emissions. In this case. the computation of
the accessibilities includes the summation of all such emission patterns and is
practically impossible. As another example. if we add the transition M —> L
then both bifurcating children emit parts of a single contiguous segment.
This case also does not have a simple representation. If the grammar is
unambiguous. it is easier to enumerate all the patterns emitting unpaired
segments. but it is not obvious whether an unambiguous grammar generally
has a simple accessibility formula.

2.2 Accessibility formula for the energy model

To derive the accessibility formula for the energy model. we use the grammar
named Rfold that was developed in a previous paper to calculate the base
pairing probabilities under the maximal span constraint (Kiryu et al.. 2008).
Rfold fully uses the advantage of the maximal span constraint and computes
base pairing probabilities and secondary structures of a given RNA sequence
with 0(NW2) time and 0(N +W2) space. which reduce to familiar 0(N3)
time and 0(N2) space when there is no constraint on the maximal span
(i.e. W =N). We have reproduced the Rfold grammar in the Supplementary
Material. The unarnbiguity of the Rfold grammar is described in detail in the
Supplementary Material of the original article and we do not repeat it here.

The Rfold model has ﬁve types of unpaired base emission rules that
correspond to external. multi (left emission). multi (right emission). hairpin
and internal/bulge loops. The energy model assigns them distinct partial
free energies. In the Rfold model. external loops are emitted by the Outer
state as right emissions: Outer—>Outer-a. Multi loops are emitted by
two states Multi and Multi2. which emit unpaired bases on the left and
right. respectively: Multi —> a-Multi. Multi2 —> Multi2-a. Hairpin and
internal/bulge loops do not have speciﬁc emission states. and they are emitted
by the following transition rules of the StemEnd state. which represent the
closing base pair of the loop model of secondary structures: StemEnd —>
ckIStemckz (k1+k2 Z 1) and StemEnd —> ck (k 3 3). where ck represents a
string of length k. Owing to the grammatical structure. the complete list of
all the patterns that emit contiguous sequences of unpaired bases of length
l,, is (see Fig. 4):

(Outer —> Outer)ll1
(Multi —> Multi)!“
(Multi2 —> Multi2)!“

StemEnd—> ck] Stem-ck; (k1 31,, or k2 31a)

StemEnd —> ck (k 31”)

Therefore. the numerator of Equation (1) is obtained by summing the
parse trees that include one of these patterns. which can also be computed
using insideioutside variables as shown graphically in Figure 4. The explicit
formulas are described in the Supplementary Material. Note that because of
the maximal span constraint. insidemutside variables are computed only
for the regions {(i,j)|l§i<j5L,[j—i|5W} in the ﬁgure. We ﬁnd the
accessibilities at each computation of the outside variables and immediately
output them to ﬁle. We need only 0(N) memory for the Outer state. and
(9(W2) memory for the other states.

We implemented the above algorithm as the software package Raccess.
For a given set of access lengths Zak (k=1,---K) and a maximal span
W. Raccess computes the accessibilities for all the possible accessible
segments (xa, Zak) (x,, = 1, . . . ,N. k = 1, . . . ,K) in a single run of insidemutside
algorithms. For a modest size of K = 10 ~ 100. the computation is dominated
by the insideioutside computations. so the time complexity is given by
0(NW2). The space complexity is 0(N +W2) for ﬁxed K as in the case
of base pairing probabilities (Kiryu et al.. 2008).

Fig. 4. The numerator of Equation (1) for the Rfold model. The explicit
formulas for these ﬁgures are presented in the Supplementary Material.

As described in the Section 1. Raccess has the advantage over RNAplfold
that it can calculate the exact accessibilities for long sequences. which is
useful for avoiding the artiﬁcial effects caused by the ends of the sliding
windows of RNAplfold. On the other hand. a major drawback to the current
implementation of Raccess compared with RNAplfold is speed: currently.
Raccess is 2710 times slower than RNAplfold for similar parameter settings.
This is mainly due to the substantial number of log-sum function calls
needed to calculate the insideioutside variables accurately. We leave the
reimplementation of Raccess as a faster program to the future.

3 DATASET AND DATA PROCESSING

3.1 Comparison of run time and memory usage

The experiments were performed on an AMD Opteron 854 Quad core 2.8
GHz with 64 GB RAM and CentOS release 5.3. We used RNAplfold of the
Vienna RNA package version 1.8.4. a binary program of Sfold version 2.2
and OligoWalk version 1.0. The test sequences were generated randomly
with equal A. C. G. U probabilities. As for Sfold. the number of sampled
structures were set to its default value (1000). If a program had no options
to constrain the maximal span or the sequence window. it was run with its
default setting with respect to that option. The command line options are
shown in the Supplementary Material.

3.2 Dependence on GC composition

We generated several random RNAs of length 10 000 with ﬁxed GC biases
and computed accessibilities for them. We used only the accessibility values
for subsequences lying at least 1000 bases from the sequence ends in order
to eliminate boundary effects.

3.3 siRNA dataset

For siRNA efﬁcacy. we used the dataset of Huesken et al. (2005) produced
using a dual reporter system on HeLa cells to measure the repression levels of
target gene expressions. The dataset contains the efﬁcacies of 2431 distinct
siRNAs targeting 34 mRNAs derived from human and rat. The efﬁcacies
Zeff are represented by the amount of mRNA expression reduction and take
values between 0 (no effect) and 100 (completely repressed). This dataset
is the largest single dataset available so far. It has been a gold standard

dataset for testing siRNA design tools since it was published. There are
several experiments for the siRNA efﬁcacy dataset. but the number of tested
siRNAs are at least a few times smaller (see Matveeva et al. (2007). for
example). Although the set of 34 mRNAs is a very tiny portion of > 10000
mRNAs in the animal genomes. the diversity of the efﬁcacies among different
siRNAs targeting the same mRNAs indicates that a signiﬁcant portion of
efﬁcacy can be explained by local features. Therefore. to investigate the
local determinants affecting the efﬁcacy. this small number of mRNAs will
not be a critical limiting factor. One possible problem of this dataset is that
the experimental conditions might be too idealized to represent real mRNAs;
Although this experiment essentially measures the efﬁcacies for free-living
mRNAs. real mRNAs might form complexes with other RNAs and proteins.
Therefore. it may be possible that the best siRNA that completely degrades
the target mRNAs in this experiment fails for the nascent mRNAs in a certain
condition. Still. the knowledge obtained from this idealized experiment
should be useful to understand the basic mechanisms of siRNA functions.

3.4 miRNA datasets

For miRNA efﬁcacy. we used the results of a microarray experiment by
Rodriguez et al. (2007). which measured the changes of gene expressions.
before and after the knock down of miR-155 of mouse by RNAi. The efﬁcacy
Zeff in this case is given by Zeff(l)=10g(gA(l)/g3(l)), where g3(i) and gA(i)
are the mRNA concentrations of the i-th gene before and after the miR-
155 knock down. respectively. We also used the microarray data of Lim
et al. (2005). where the authors measured gene expression changes after
the transfection of miRNAs (miR-l. miR-124) in HeLa cells. The efﬁcacy
Zeff in this case is given by Zeff(l)=10g(g3(l)/gA(l)), where g3(i) and gA(i)
are the mRNA concentrations of the i-th gene before and after the miRNA
transfection. respectively. In both cases. the putative target genes are deﬁned
by all the genes that have 7mer seed sequences in their 3’-UTR sequences.
There are numerous papers that the existence of 6.7-mer seed sequence is
the most important feature of the mRNAs targeted by miRNAs (Lim et al..
2005). Usually. we observe clear statistical evidence that the mRNAs with
seed sequences are down(up) regulated after over(under) expression of the
miRNA. Since there are no comprehensive dataset that identiﬁes the binding
sites at single nucleotide resolution. we used the putative binding sites. We
expect that if the number of false positives are too large. then no statistical
signiﬁcance will be observed. On the other hand. if there is any statistical
signiﬁcance. then we consider that it suggests the nature of true binding sites.

3.5 siRNA off-target dataset

The dataset of Huesken et al. (2005) only measures the repression of
target mRNAs for a large number of siRNA species. and it does not
measure off-target effects of those siRNAs. To investigate off-target effects
of siRNA transfection. we conducted a microarray experiment where human
ﬁbroblast cells (CCD-18co) were transfected by a 27mer siRNA (positive-
siRNA) targeting the ‘carbohydrate (N -acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-0)
sulfotransferase 15’ (CHST15) gene. This siRNA is currently in a preclinical
study and is being developed for the treatment of Crohn’s disease stricture.
which occurs in 30% of Crohn’s disease patients. and is the leading cause
of repeat surgery. CHST15 has been shown to be overexpressed at sites of
ﬁbrosis in Crohn’s disease patients. and upregulation of CHST15 correlates
with the severity of ﬁbrosis in animal models of colitis with intestinal ﬁbrosis
(Imamura. 2008; Kai et al.. 2007; Suzuki et al.. 2010).

The gene expression is compared with those of a negative control [the
same ﬁbroblast cells transfected by a different 27mer siRNA (negative-
siRNA)]. The siRNA in the negative control was derived from a green
ﬂuorescent gene that did not have a signiﬁcant match (i.e. no contiguous
19mer match within hamming distance 1) with any of the human RefSeq
genes. We calculated the efﬁcacy by the formula Zeff(i)=IOg (gp(i)/gN(i)).
where gp(i) and gN(i) represent the mRNA concentrations of the i-th gene
after the transfection of positive-siRNA (25 nM) and negative-siRNA (5 nM).
respectively. The details of the microarray experiment are described in

the Supplementary Material. The microarray dataset is available from our
web site.

3.6 Efﬁcacy—accessibility correlation

We categorized the dataset into two groups based on the accessibilities around
the target sites. For a given access segment s” which was speciﬁed by an
access length l,, and an access position x” relative to the (putative) binding
site. we ranked the dataset by the accessibility of s”. We labeled the most
accessible 30% of data points as group 1 and the others as group 2. Then
we computed Welch’s t-statistic. which tests the difference of the efﬁcacy
distribution between two groups:

[2% (2)

where 11.,» and s, are the mean and the SD of the efﬁcacy in group 1'.
respectively. and n, is the size of the group i. A value [>0 indicates that
more accessible segments are more effective targets. Because the size of the
dataset is rather large. the null distribution for t can be approximated by the
standard normal distribution. This approximation is used when we mention
P-Values in Figures 7. 8. 10 and 11.

There are three major statistics for testing the difference of means (or
medians) between two groups of data: Student’s t-statistic (ST). Wilcoxoni
Mann7Whitney U statistic (WMW) and Welch’s t-statistic (WT). Each of
these methods is based on speciﬁc assumptions about the null distribution:
ST assumes that two groups of data are sampled from an identical normal
distribution; WMW assumes two groups of data are sampled from an
identical but arbitrary-shape distribution; WT assumes two groups of data
are sampled from two distinct normal distributions with equal mean. Since it
is difﬁcult to assume that our datasets exactly conform to these assumptions
even in the null case. we have to use them under the existence of certain
Violations of basic assumptions. There are numerous statistics papers that
investigate to what extent those methods are robust under such Violations.
Generally. the statistical power does not suddenly disappear with a tiny
Violation from the assumptions. but it rather degrades gradually with increase
of deviation from them (Donald. 2004; Morten and LeiV. 2009). A recent
article recommends WT. which we have used in the following. as the ﬁrst
choice method for testing differences between group-wise means (Morten
and LeiV. 2009).

In the following. we do not consider the multiple corrections for P-Values.
since it is very difﬁcult to ﬁnd an appropriate method for multiple correction.
due to the strong correlations of the P-Values among neighboring accessible
segments. Still. the obtained P-Values are very useful. as they represent
the relative strengths of the efﬁcacyiaccessibility correlations taking the
datasizes and variances into account.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Comparison of run time and memory usage

Table 1 shows the run time and memory usages for several patterns
of sequence length, maximal span and sequence window size. The
accessible length la is ﬁxed to 20 in these computations. Among the
programs, Raccess is the only program that returns correctly within
10 h. RNAplfold is a few times faster than Raccess in many cases, but
it does not work for large sequence windows due to overﬂow errors.
Sfold does not return within 10 h for the 10 000 base sequence.
OligoWalk is slower than the other programs. The memory usage
shows that all the programs use only moderate memory space when
they return correctly within the time limit.

4.2 Dependence on GC composition

Figure 5 shows how the access energy AEaCC depends on the
GC composition, the access length la and the maximal span W.
Figure 5A shows that the access energy increases with GC
composition and their slopes are more steep with increasing la.
Figure 5B shows that AEaCC is linearly dependent on the access
length la. Figure 5C shows that, if W > 100, the accessibility is only
weakly dependent on the maximal span W, as compared to the strong
dependence on the GC composition. This insensitivity to W is a
favorable feature which is not satisﬁed by other statistics, such as the
base pairing probability matrix where the number of highly probable
base pairs constantly increases with W. The predicted secondary
structure also changes considerably with W. In this sense, it may
be said that the accessibility is a better statistic of the energy model

than the base pairing probability matrix or the predicted secondary
structure.

We have also investigated the dependence of the accessibility on
the distance to the end points of the sequence and on the distant
nucleotide contents of the sequence. The results are shown in the
Supplementary Material, where we show that the accessibilities
are affected by the positions of the end points and by the distant
nucleotides if they are located within a distance several times as
large as the maximal span W.

4.3 siRNA efﬁcacy dataset

Figure 6 shows the scatter plot of siRNA—target data at particular
W, l01 and xa values. Although the variances are very large, the
mean value of efﬁcacy Zeff steadily decreases with the access
energy AEaCC, which suggests that the accessibility is an important
determinant of efﬁcacy.

Fig. 7. Density plot of siRNA efﬁcacy7accessibility correlations. The x-axis
is the access position x” relative to the 3’-end of each binding site. The 19mer
binding region is shown as the thick bar between the arrows. The y-axis is
access length 1,, in log scale. The value of t given by Equation (2) is indicated
by shading according to the density scale shown. Only t-Values exceeding 6
which corresponds to P% 10‘9 in the normal approximation are shown for
clarity. The maximal span W is set at 400.

Figure 7 shows the main result of the article, namely the
correlation between the accessibility and the siRNA efﬁcacy for
various access lengths and access positions relative to the binding
sites. Here, we can clearly see a strong positive correlation between
the efﬁcacy and the access segments on the vertical line of the
downstream end of the binding site (x01 :0). The blotted regions
are roughly symmetrical around xa =0, and moreover, almost all
the corresponding access segments include the base at xa = 0. This
may indicate the underlying mechanism of the siRNA function:
the accessibility of this position may be essential for the RISC
complex to recognize the target site and to implement its cleavage
function. Previous studies have considered the efﬁcacy—accessibility
correlation in the context of static or equilibrium aspects of siRNA
function, where they have compared the free energy difference
between bound and unbound states of siRNA—mRNA pairs (Lu and
Mathews, 2008a; Shao et al., 2007; Tafer et al., 2008). However, our
results suggest that the accessibility is more related to the dynamical
or kinetic aspects of the siRNA mechanism, that is, accessible
target sites might help siRNA binding by lowering the activation
(initiation) energy barrier of the reaction.

Table 2 shows the dependence of siRNA efﬁcacy—accessibility
correlations on the maximal span W. Although the accessibility
values are relatively insensitive to W as shown in Figure 5C,
W=400 shows better correlation rs and maximal t-value tmax than
the other W values. Hence, we set W =400 in the following sections.

4.4 miRNA datasets

Figure 8 shows the density plots of t-values for the miRNA datasets.
Compared to Figure 7, the statistical signiﬁcances appear much
weaker. This may be due to the non-speciﬁcity of 7 mer sequence,
bearing a high level of noise, and the smaller size of the dataset (a
few hundred points compared to 2431 for siRNA). We can, however,
still ﬁnd some interesting features in these ﬁgures. The miR-l24
dataset (Fig. 8C) shows strong correlations between the efﬁcacy

and the accessibility around the putative binding site, which appears
similar to the siRNA case. On the other hand, the miR-l55 and miR-
l datasets show weak t-values at xa ~ 0, but there are broad regions
(la1 = 70 ~ 100) downstream of the putative binding site, where
accessibility is positively correlated with efﬁcacy. Interestingly,
all the ﬁgures have a weakly blotted region around xa =40...60,
lﬂ1 = 10. . .20. They might be reﬂecting the mechanisms of the miRNA
functions such as protein binding and speciﬁc conformations of the
mRNAs downstream of the binding site.

4.5 siRNA off-target dataset

As described in the Methods section, an siRNA targeting a glycogene
(CHST15) are transfected into human ﬁbroblast cells. The length
of the siRNA is 27 mer instead of the 21mer of conventional
siRNAs. Such longer siRNAs are called Dicer-substrate siRNAs
(DsiRNAs) (Kim et al., 2005). They are ﬁrst cleaved by Dicer
to form 21mer siRNAs, which then implement their usual RNAi
function. Previous studies (Kim et al., 2005) have shown that
transfection of DsiRNAs is far more efﬁcient than transfecting
21mer siRNAs directly. The sequences of the siRNA are shown
in Figure 9. There are two possible patterns (L, R) that produce
a 21mer siRNA with a single Dicer slicing. Each cleavage pattern
is expected to show off-target effects speciﬁc to the seed sequence
at the cleavage site. We computed the t-values for all the 7 mer
subsequences of siRNAs and the corresponding P-values are plotted
in Figure 10. Position 6 of the sense and antisense strand have the
largest P-values, which implies that both the ‘L’ and ‘R’ cleavage
patterns show off-target effects. The density plot of t-values for this
seed GAUGAAU corresponding to ‘R’ type cleavage (Fig. 11A)
is very similar to the plots for the miRNAs, especially that for
the miRNA knock down dataset (Fig. 8A). This indicates that the
siRNA off-target effect occurs by the same mechanisms as miRNA
repression. Figure 1 1B shows the accessibility—efﬁcacy plot for each
gene (la1 = 16, W=400 and AEaCC is averaged over access positions
xa in the range [—5, 5]). The genes whose expressions might be most
strongly affected by the off-target effects are shown in Table 3. These
include TWIST neighbor protein, oxytocin receptor and insulin-like

5 FURTHER DISCUSSION

5.1 Comparison of different tools

In this subsection, we summarize the notable features of the used
programs.

Sfold is based on the posterior sampling algorithm and has time
complexity (9(NW2+MNW) (N: sequence length, W: maximal
span, M: number of sampled structures). It is useful for computing
various types of expected values other than the accessibility. Sfold
is an integrated software package which has various options for

designing efﬁcient siRNAs, trans-cleaving ribozymes, nucleic acid
probes, etc. The disadvantages of Sfold are that the results are subject
to random ﬂuctuations and the errors of the calculated probability
values are at least 1 /M. For a long sequence, sampled structures are
not a good representation of the Boltzmann distribution in the large
structure space. It means the computed probabilities are inaccurate
for such sequences.

OligoWalk uses a version of McCaskills DP algorithm adapted
to the cases where the RNA sequences are subject to accessibility
constraints. It has time complexity (9(N3). It does not only
compute the accessibilities but also predicts efﬁcient siRNAs by
combining the accessibility with other features. The high accuracy
of predictions are conﬁrmed in Lu and Mathews (2008a). As a tool to
compute the accessibilities, it is slower than other programs. Further,
since the maximal span is always equal to the sequence window size,
the computed accessibility values are subject to boundary effects for
long RNA sequences.

RNAplfold has time complexity (9(NS2) (S: sequence window
size). It is the fastest program in many cases and appropriate
for a genomic scan. When sequence window size S is small, the
accessibility values are subject to boundary effects. When S is as
large as one thousand bases, RNAplfold causes overﬂow errors.

Raccess has time complexity (9(NW2). It can compute the
accessibility values for long sequences without using sequence
windows nor causing overﬂow errors. On the other hand, it is a
few times slower than RNAplfold in many cases. It does not predict
efﬁcient siRNAs.

5.2 Limitation of our study

There are a few limitations in the experimental data as well as the
analyses used in this study. As for the siRNA efﬁcacy data (Huesken
et al., 2005), the number of target mRNAs is only 34, which is a small
sample of the human genes. Hence, it is possible the results obtained
from them might not generalize to other mRNAs. Regarding our
analytical method, it should be noted that the accessibility values
between neighboring or overlapping accessible segments are similar
to each other. It indicates that the t-values among close points in the
density plots are not independent and correlated. It is also noted
that even when the computed P-values are quite signiﬁcant, the
underlying efﬁcacy data are subject to high variability as shown in
Figure 6. Further, since these analyses is based on observational
studies, the correlation of Figure 6 could be subject to confounding
and unreported correlations [see Efron (2004)]. However, none of
these limitations easily explains the pattern of the t-value densities
around the 5’-end of binding sites observed in Figure 7. Since
the high t-value regions are roughly symmetric around position
zero, it is unlikely that they are caused by any sequence bias of

the siRNA sequences. The fact that the high t-values occur for
accessible segment with length up to 100 indicates that they are
not simply caused by the local sequence features around position
zero. These are the reasons that we believe that Figure 6 reﬂects
the roles of the accessibility in the siRNA mechanisms. On the
other hand, the results are somewhat weaker for the miRNA dataset
and siRNA off-target dataset (Lim et al., 2005; Rodriguez et al.,
2007; Suzuki et al., 2010). Since only a few number of miRNAs
and siRNA are examined due to unavailability of data, it is difﬁcult
to extract general rules for the accessibility—efﬁcacy correlations
with conﬁdence. Furthermore, since the binding sites used for the
density plots are only putative, the results are subject to statistical
noise caused by the false binding sites.

5.3 Using accessibility for efﬁcient siRNA design

Previous studies (Lu and Mathews, 2008a; Tafer et al., 2008)
have used the accessibility as one of the major features to predict
efﬁcient siRNAs. In particular, OligoWalk (Lu and Mathews, 2008a)
combines several sequence and thermodynamic features including
the accessibility using a support vector machine. Although the
correlation of each of those features is only up to 0.35, it predicts
siRNAs of efﬁcacy > 70% with high performance (sensitivity 22.7%
and speciﬁcity 96.5%). It will be interesting to investigate whether
our exhaustive calculation further improves the performance of
siRNA design tools.

6 CONCLUSION

We have conducted a detailed investigation of accessibilities around
the target sites of siRNAs and miRNAs. We ﬁrst developed an
algorithm for computing local accessibilities of RNA sequences,
and implemented it as a software package called ‘Raccess’. Raccess
exhaustively calculates the exact accessibilities based on an energy
model under a maximal span constraint of base pairs. Using Raccess,
we investigated how accessibility depends on the GC content,
the access length and the maximal span. We showed that the
computed accessibilities are relatively insensitive to the choice
of the maximal span. Then, we computed for both siRNAs and
miRNAs the correlations between efﬁcacy and accessibility around
the target sites. We found that the efﬁcacy of siRNAs depends
strongly on the accessibility of the very 3’-end of their binding
sites, which might reﬂect the mechanism for target site recognition
by the RISC complex. We also showed that the efﬁcacies of some
miRNAs have positive correlations with accessibilities in broad
regions downstream of their putative binding sites, which might
imply that the downstream regions of the target sites are bound by
other proteins, allowing the miRNAs to implement their function.
We also investigated the off-target effects of an siRNA which is
being investigated as a potential RNA medicine. We showed that
the off-target effects of the siRNA have similar correlations to the
miRNA activities, indicating that the off-target effects of the siRNA
are caused by the same mechanism as the target repression of the
miRNAs.

We only investigated the relation between accessibility and
siRNA/miRNA efﬁcacy. However, accessibility is expected to
inﬂuence every type of biological process involving RNA molecules.
It will be interesting to investigate the accessibilities of general
mRNAs and other ﬁinctional RNA molecules. Computation of

accessibilities has many potential biotechnological applications
other than efﬁcient siRNA design. For example, accessibility can
be an important factor in the design of efﬁcient probes for in situ
hybridization. Some portion of the positional inhomogeneity of read
tag counts observed in RNA-seq data can be also attributed to
the local accessibilities of mRNA molecules. Investigating to what
extent the computed accessibilities are useful in these applications
will also be interesting.

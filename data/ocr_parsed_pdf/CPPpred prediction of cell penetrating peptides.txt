advantage over frequency-based methods, in that they incorporate infor-
mation about relative positions of amino acids in a sequence, whilst also
minimizing the risk of overﬁtting. All possible overlapping motifs in a
sequence are processed by the same basic unit, using the same parameters.
For this reason, they are advantageous over algorithms that look at a
ﬁxed input window, as they overcome the problem of choosing an arbi-
trary reference frame for peptides of different sizes. They also have a
potential advantage over methods that do not rely on fixed windows
(e.g. support vector machines (SVM) based on spectral or alignment
kernels), in that Nl-NNs learn a transform of the sequence that is in-
formative to predict the target property, rather than relying on any pre-
deﬁned transform or set thereof. If training is successful, the feature
vector will retain what is useful in the input and discard what is not.
This is subtly different from compressing the sequence into some code
ﬁrst (potentially erasing useful information) and then optimizing the map
between the code and the target.

2.4 Training and Ensembling

Each training was conducted in 5-fold cross-validation, i.e. ﬁve different
sets of training runs were performed in which a different ﬁfth of the
overall set was reserved for testing and another ﬁfth was reserved for
validating. During training the networks that performed best on the val-
idation set were saved; these models were then averaged over the ensem-
ble and evaluated on the corresponding test set. The ﬁnal result for the
5-fold cross-validation is the average of the results on each test set. When
testing on the independent test set, we ensemble-combined all the models
from all cross-validation folds of the best architecture.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The only other publicly available CPP predictor that we are
aware of is CellPPD (Gautam et al., 2013). Owing to the short
nature of CPPs and the impact that single residue changes can
have on the efﬁciency of penetration, or non—penetration, the
authors did not internally redundancy reduce their training set,
or redundancy reduce their independent test sets with respect to
their training set. We were concerned that this could have po—
tentially led to overﬁtting of their models. Because the datasets of
penetrating peptides are relatively dominated by cationic and
amphiphilic peptides, we considered that the redundancy reduc—
tion to avoid overfitting would eliminate most of the data.
However, we were pleased to note that training was still possible
even after 80% redundancy reduction (i.e. no more than 80%
identity between any two sequences) (see Table 1). The predictive
power of CPPpred is demonstrated in Figure 1. We note that the
performance is good on both the redundancy reduced training
set (Fig. la) and independent test set (Fig. lb), which was redun—
dancy reduced with respect to the training set, indicating that our
method is not showing very obvious signs of extensive overﬁt—
ting, despite the relatively small training set of 74 CPPs.

More extensive redundancy reduction in the training set would
be likely to reduce the ability to train a useful predictor
(Supplementary Material). However, it is worth noting that
after 30% redundancy reduction of the test set, CPPpred cor—
rectly predicted 17 of the 29 CPPs and 27 of the 29 non—CPPs
(Q = 75.86%).

each of these peptides will be cell penetrating. When the user is
interpreting the results, it is important to note that the server
predicts how likely the peptide is to be cell penetrating, and
does not predict the degree of uptake efﬁciency. CPPpred was
trained at a threshold of 0.5, i.e. any peptide predicted over a 0.5
threshold is labeled as cell penetrating. Roughly, one—fifth of
peptides above 0.5 are false positives, whereas less than a tenth
of peptides above 0.7 are false positives (Fig. 1a). However, the
user may decide to choose a higher threshold to reduce the false—
positive rate. Training and testing was performed using amino
acid sequences without any modiﬁcations. After using CPPpred
to discover CPPs in silico, various peptide modiﬁcations may be
experimented with in vitro to increase the uptake efﬁciency of the
peptide.

3.2 CPPpred—a worked example

CPPpred provides researchers interested in bioactive peptides
and nutraceuticals with an important resource for evaluating
the cell penetrating potential of candidate peptides of interest.
To demonstrate the application of CPPpred to empirical data,
we selected a known bioactive peptide, lactoferricin B, from
bovine milk for analysis. Lactoferiicin B, consisting of 25
amino acids, exhibits antimicrobial activity (Bellamy et al.,
1993) and has been shown experimentally to be cell penetrating
(Haukland et al., 2001). Importantly, this peptide (or any asso—
ciated subsets) is not found in either our training or test sets.
When CPPpred is applied to lactoferricin B, a prediction score of
0.725 is achieved, demonstrating the predictive power of
CPPpred.

Further to this, an 11 amino acid subsequence of lactoferricin
B, also with known antimicrobial activity (S12er et al., 2002),
attains a CPPpred score of 0.815. Although the cell penetrating
capabilities of this undecapeptide have not yet been validated
experimentally, it is widely appreciated that cell penetration is
a feature of antimicrobial peptides (Splith and Neundorf, 2011).
We feel that this example highlights the potential utility of
CPPpred in assisting researchers in the selection of peptides for
chemical synthesis to experimentally verify their cell penetrating
potential.

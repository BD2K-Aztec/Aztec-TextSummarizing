Fig. 1. Plot of the predicted versus the observed base quality score for
control reads. Ideally the base qualities should follow the diagonal line.
The root mean square error (RMSE) shows that quality scores predicted
using freeris have a greater correlation to their observed error rates

The human sequences were mapped to the th9 version of the human genome. The
number of mapped sequences and the average number of mismatches for those were
tallied for each method. Time trials were conducted on a machine with 74 GB of
RAM and using 8 of the 12 Intel Xeon cores running at 2.27GHz. "Percentage

thymine retention (Kircher et al., 2009). The reads produced by
both versions were aligned back to the ¢X174 genome, and the
number of sequences mapped and average edit distance was
computed. We observed that LIBOCAS outperforms the previ—
ous SVM library for both metrics.

Because the introduction of incorrectly labelled training ex—
amples could inﬂuence the quality of the SVM model, we
sought to evaluate whether our masking procedure would have
an effect on the number of mapped reads. The mapping statistics
confirmed that masking divergent bases on the ¢X genome im—
proves the final sequence accuracy (170 572 sequences mapped)
compared with not masking any bases (170 220) or masking
random bases (170 225).

We tested freeris on a recent paired—end GAIIx run from
mid—2011 from our own sequencing centre with 2 x 126 cycles
and a single index of seven nucleotides. This multiplexed run had
both human DNA as target, and ¢X174 as control and was
basecalled using the previous version, Ibis, and the current one,
freeris as well as naiveBayesCall (v. 0.3) and All your base
(AYB, v2.08). We compared how each performed in terms of
sequence accuracy, the number of sequences mapped and edit

distance to the reference, as well as runtime (Table 1). We
showed that freeris provides more high—quality base calls, lead—
ing to an increased number of reads being mapped to the refer—
ence with a lower edit distance than is the case for other
basecallers. The predicted versus observed quality scores were
plotted for Bustard and for freeris (Fig. 1). The sequences for
the two GA runs used for comparison were produced using
Bustard Off—Line Basecaller (OLB v.1.9.3). Our results show
that freeris offers an improved accuracy and calibrated quality
scores for these sequencing runs (including one on a HiSeq and
another on a MiSeq) and outperforms Bustard on runs with
unusually high error rates (see Supplementary Data).

Using the genotype calls from the same sequencing data but
using three different basecallers (Ibis, freeris and Bustard) to
compare with calls from Sanger sequences, we determined that
freeris offers improved genotyping accuracy (see
Supplementary Data).

4 CONCLUSION

Freeris provides substantial improvements in sequence accur—
acy, quality score calibration and genotyping accuracy over
Bustard, and is more computationally efficient than equally ac—
curate model—based methods such as AYB.

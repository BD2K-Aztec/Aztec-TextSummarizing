ABSTRACT

Motivation: 3’ end processing is important for transcription termin-
ation, mRNA stability and regulation of gene expression. To identify
3’ ends, most techniques use an oligo-dT primer to construct deep
sequencing libraries. However, this approach can lead to identification
of artifactual polyadenylation sites due to internal priming in homopo-
lymeric stretches of adenines. Although heuristic filters have been
applied in these cases, they typically result in a high proportion of
both false-positive and -negative classifications. Therefore, there is a
need to develop improved algorithms to better identify mis-priming
events in oligo-dT primed sequences.

Results: By analyzing sequence features flanking 3’ ends derived from
oligo-dT-based sequencing, we developed a naive Bayes classifier to
classify them as true or false/internally primed. The resulting algorithm
is highly accurate, outperforms previous heuristic filters and facilitates
identification of novel polyadenylation sites.

1 INTRODUCTION

3’ end processing of pre-mRNAs inﬂuences transcription termin-
ation, mRNA stability and localization and dynamic regulation of
translation. In plants, yeast and metazoans, sequence elements in
the 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR) direct cleavage and polyade-
nylation (reviewed in Millevoi and Vagner, 2010; Proudfoot,
2011). Among these elements is the polyadenylation signal
(PAS), a deﬁned hexameric sequence located 1&30 nucleotides
(nt) upstream of the cleavage and polyadenylation site (pA site),
which binds Cleavage and Polyadenylation Speciﬁcity Factor
complex (Millevoi and Vagner, 2010; Proudfoot, 2011). The
PAS predominantly comprises the sequence AAUAAA (Proud-
foot and Brownlee, 1976), although single nucleotide variants are
also functional (Beaudoing et al., 2000; Sheets et al., 1990). In
addition to the PAS, a guanine/uracil— or uracil-rich downstream
sequence element can be found 2&40 nt downstream of the pA site
that is recognized by Cleavage Stimulatory Factor (Millevoi and
Vagner, 2010; Proudfoot, 2011). In some instances, a uracil-rich
sequence element is present upstream of the PAS, which may also
act to enhance usage of a specific PAS by recruiting Cleavage

Factor I (Millevoi and Vagner, 2010; Proudfoot, 2011). In com-
bination, these sequence elements help deﬁne the site of cleavage
and polyadenylation at the 3’ end of a pre-mRNA.

Most efforts to identify 3’ ends of mRNAs have relied on prim-
ing with an oligonucleotide of deoxythymines (oligo-dT). These
efforts include early studies relying on expressed sequence tags
(ESTs; Beaudoing et al., 2000; Tian et al., 2005; Zhang et al.,
2005), as well as more recent work using deep sequencing (re-
viewed in Mueller et al., 2013). These include Poly(A) Site sequen-
cing (PAS-Seq; Shepard et al., 2011) and PolyA-Seq (Derti et al.,
2012), which rely on oligo—dT containing primers for first strand
cDNA synthesis. While these approaches are technically straight-
forward, oligo-dT binding can occur in internal homopolymeric
stretches of adenines (Nam et al., 2002) leading to identiﬁcation of
false-positive pA sites. A more selective method is poly(A)-pos—
ition profiling by sequencing (referred to as 3pseq), where a splint
RNA2DNA oligonucleotide with overhanging thymines is hybri-
dized and ligated to the polyadenylated tail of mRNAs to prevent
internal priming (Jan et al., 2011). However, 3pseq is technically
demanding and most laboratories are more likely to use oligo-dT-
primed approaches. In these latter cases, internal priming events
are generally ﬁltered from datasets based on the number of aden-
ines in the genomic sequence downstream of the cleavage site
(Beaudoing et al., 2000; Brockman et al., 2005; Fu et al., 2011;
Haenni et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2011; Shepard
et al., 2011; Smibert et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2005; Wilkening et al.,
2013; Wu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2005). However, the strict
deﬁnition of these heuristic filters inevitably misses some internal
priming events (false positives) and also excludes true 3’ ends (false
negatives; Sherstnev et al., 2012). Thus, additional methods are
needed to easily analyze oligo-dT primed deep sequencing data to
identify true pA sites.

A na'ive Bayes classiﬁer, based on Bayes theorem, is a super-
vised learning algorithm in which the features used to predict the
class are considered conditionally independent (Alpayd1n, 2010).
Naive Bayes classiﬁers are computationally efﬁcient, require rela-
tively small training datasets, handle both continuous and dis-
crete features and ignore non-relevant features (Kotsiantis et al.,
2006; Alpayd1n, 2010). Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
a naive Bayes classiﬁer to identify internal priming events in
oligo-dT primed sequencing data. We ﬁnd that our trained algo-
rithm outperforms heuristic ﬁlters and enriches for 3’ ends in
oligo-dT sequencing data that bear canonical motifs important
for cleavage and polyadenylation. Biological validation shows
that our method is highly accurate, facilitating identification of
novel 3’ UTRs and 3’ ends in multiple animal species.

Accurate identification of polyadenylation sites from 3’ end deep sequencing using a naive Bayes classifier

 

2 METHODS

2.1 Zebraﬁsh care and staging

Zebrafish were maintained as described in (Westerﬁeld, 1993) and staged
as described in (Kimmel et al., 1995). Studies were performed under the
approval of the University of Massachusetts Medical School Institutional
Animal Care and Usage Committee.

2.2 RNA puriﬁcation

Total RNA was puriﬁed from either 6 or 24 hpf wild-type CF zebraﬁsh
and treated with DNase I (Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen RNase-Free
DNase Set). Polyadenylated RNA was selected using magnetic oligo-dT
beads (Invitrogen mRNA Direct Kit).

2.3 RNA-seq libraries and data analysis

The 24 hpf zebraﬁsh RNA-seq library was built using an Illumina
mRNA-seq protocol (Part # 1004898 Rev. D) and paired-end sequenced
on an Illumina Genome Analyzer II (76 nt reads) and an Illumina Hi-Seq
(101 nt reads). Sanger 6hpf RNA-seq data were downloaded from the
European Bioinformatics Institute (run ERR022485). RNA-seq reads
from both developmental stages starting with at least ﬁve thymines (the
reverse complement of a polyadenylated mRNA) or ending with at least
ﬁve adenines were mapped to the zebraﬁsh genome (ZV9) using Bowtie
(Langmead et al., 2009; Supplementary Fig. SlA). Those that mapped to
the genome were taken as sites for potential internal oligo-dT priming
and included in the True Negative training set (Supplementary Fig. SlA).
The site of internal priming was assigned to the single nucleotide imme-
diately upstream of the last mapped 3’ adenine in this set (referred to as
RNA-seq internally primed sites). Sequence fragments that did not ini-
tially map were trimmed of terminal adenines (or thymines) and re-
mapped (Supplementary Fig. SlA). Mapped reads (referred to as
RNA-seq putative pA sites) were combined with the PAS-Seq data for
establishment of the True Positive training sets (Supplementary Fig. SlA;
see Training Sets).

2.4 3’ end deep sequencing datasets

We constructed PAS-Seq libraries as described in (Shepard et al., 2011),
using barcoded adapters, and paired-end sequenced on an Illumina Hi-
Seq (101 nt reads) with a custom sequencing primer described in (Shepard
et al., 2011) designed to exclude the remainder of the poly(A) tail from
sequencing. Libraries were de-convoluted using Perl scripts and mapped
to the zebraﬁsh genome (ZV9) using Tophat (Trapnell et al., 2009).
Zebraﬁsh 6 and 24hpf 3pseq (Ulitsky et al., 2011) and mammalian
polyA-seq alignments (Derti et al., 2012) were downloaded from the
Gene Expression Omnibus (accession numbers GSE32880, GSE30198).
cleanUpdTSeq (see below) was used to classify putative sites from unﬁl-
tered polyA-seq as true or false, using a probability assignment
cutoff: 0.5. No additional ﬁltering was performed on the 3pseq or the
originally ﬁltered polyA-seq datasets.

2.5 RNA-Seq Transcriptome Analysis

To assess the utility of our classiﬁer on an annotated transcriptome, we
used it on previously published RNA-seq models for zebraﬁsh embryos
described in Pauli et al. (2012). Unique 3’ transcript ends were classiﬁed
using cleanUpdTSeq as described below.

2.6 pA site builds

A custom Perl script clustered mapped sequencing reads into putative pA
sites. Mapped reads were trimmed 3’ terminal nt, which corresponds to
the site of cleavage. Reads were clustered first for identically matching
sites. An iterative process was used to cluster adjacent sites within :l:5 nt,

starting with the site with the highest number of reads. Within a cluster,
the putative pA site was deﬁned as the location with the most reads and
the total reads were combined to give the height. Mann7Whitney test was
performed to assess height differences between datasets (Hollander and
Wolfe, 1999). Concordance between datasets was deﬁned as being within
:l:10 nt using a Perl script. The distance from the putative PAS to the pA
site was determined as the distance from the 3’ end of the PAS to the pA
site.

2.7 Training Sets

RNA-seq putative pA sites were combined with the PAS-Seq putative pA
sites and clustered as described above (Supplementary Fig. SlA). Sites
concordant between the PAS-Seq and the 3pseq data sets were assigned
to the True Positive training set (Supplementary Fig. SlA). 3pseq coord-
inates were used if there was not an exact match. RNA-seq internally
primed sites not concordant with 3pseq were assigned to the True
Negative training set (Supplementary Fig. SlA). Only sites that were
present in both the 6 and 24 hpf datasets were used for training
(Supplementary Fig. SIB). We did not take the number of sequencing
reads that composed a putative pA site into account.

2.8 cleanUpdTSeq

The function buildFeatureVector in the cleanUpdTSeq package was used
to build feature vectors for training dataset and test dataset. Features
include presence/absence of 4096 hexamers in the upstream of the pA
sites, downstream mononucleotide count, downstream dinucleotide count
and average distance of downstream adenines to the pA site
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). The upstream features are modeled as bino-
mial variables and the downstream features are modeled as normal vari-
ables. A naive Bayes classiﬁer was built using the training data and the
function buildClassiﬁer, which leverages the R package e1071 with
laplace set to 1. To classify the test dataset, the predictClass function
was applied. These functions along with sequence fetching utilities
and training data are available on our website (lawsonlab.umassmed.
edu/cleanupdtseq.html). The package cleanUpdTSeq is available at
Bioconductor.org.

2.9 Performance Metrics

Precision, recall, true negative rate (TNR), false discovery rate (FDR),
false positive rate (FPR), accuracy, F-score and Matthew’s correlation
coefficient (MCC) were calculated using the following equations.

Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient was used to assess nucleotide proﬁle
correlation (Pietrokovski, 1996; R Core Team, 2013). To apply heuristic
ﬁlters (8A and 8A plus top 10 PAS), Perl scripts were used to classify all
putative pA sites from the training set (True Positives and True
Negatives).

2.10 Model selection, training set size and relative feature
importance

For performance evaluation, the training datasets were randomly split
(70% used for training and 30% used for cross-validation) in 10 trials,
each with a range of probability cutoffs from 0 to 1 at an interval of 0.1
for each combination of upstream (2(F50 nt in increments of 10 nt) and
downstream (3(F50 nt in increments of 10 nt) sequence. We calculated
average precision, recall, F-score, accuracy, true negative rate, false dis-
covery rate, false positive rate and MCC from 10 cross-validations of
each model, using a probability of true cutoff of 0.5 (Supplementary
Table S1). We chose 40 nt of upstream and 30 nt of downstream sequence
for subsequent PAS identiﬁcation.

To evaluate training set size, we trained the classiﬁer with 15995
(50%), 19194 (60%), 22393 (70%), 25592 (80%) or 28791 (90%)
peaks and used the remainder for cross validation. Average precision,
recall, F-score, accuracy, true negative rate, false discovery rate, false
positive rate and MCC from 10 cross-validation trials were calculated
as above.

To evaluate the relative importance of each feature, P-values using
prop.test in R and odds ratio were calculated for the binary features
(Mladenic and Grobelnik, 1999). For the continuous features, P-values
were calculated using t-test. Features were ordered by P-values, with
lowest values indicating greatest importance. Upstream features
(binary) and downstream features (continuous) are listed separately in
Supplementary Tables S2A and B, respectively. In addition, the top
200 positive upstream features are listed in Supplementary Table S2C,
which only include top upstream features with odds ratio <0. The pres-
ence of positive features is associated with increased probability of being a
true polyadenylation site.

2.11 PAS ﬂanking sequence characterization

Commonly used zebraﬁsh PASs were identiﬁed by applying Multiple Em
for Motif Elicitation (MEME) (Bailey and Elkan, 1994) to 50 nt upstream
of 3’ ends annotated in Ensembl (v61). These were used to build a Perl
script to search for a canonical or variant PASs. For mammals, a Perl
script was used to search for a canonical or variant PAS in order of
decreasing usage in polyA-seq data (Derti et al., 2012). For the True
Positive and True Negative training sets, 50 nt upstream for all of the
sites was examined using MEME (Bailey and Elkan, 1994) with the fol-
lowing settings: -minw 5 -maxw 10 foops. 50 nt downstream of all of the
sites was examined using the options: -minw 5 -maxw 50 foops. For
the other datasets, 40 nt upstream of the pA site and 30 nt downstream of
10000 randomly chosen sites within the dataset were used for analysis
(upstream: -minw 5 -maxw 10 ~OOpS; downstream: -minw 5 -maxw
30 7 oops).

2.12 Poly(A) tail length assays

Total RNA was puriﬁed from 24hpf wild-type CF zebrafish (Qiagen
RNeasy Mini Kit). For the G-tail assay, we used the Affymetrix
Poly(A) Tail-Length Assay Kit to add guanosines and inosines to the
3’ end of the polyadenylated mRNAs (Martin and Keller, 1998).
Subsequently, reverse transcription was performed with a poly-cytosine
anchored primer. Alternatively, we used an oligo-dT(10) primer to make
cDNA (Murray and Schoenberg, 2008). In both cases cDNAs were used
as a template in a 20 cycle primary PCR with Hot Master Taq DNA
polymerase (5’) to amplify the 3’ end with poly(A) tail with a forward

primer and assay-speciﬁc reverse primer (G-Tail: Affymetrix Poly(A)
Tail-Length Assay Kit Universal Primer, oligo-dT:
GGGGATCCGCGGTTTTTTTTTT; Murray and Schoenberg, 2008).
Nested PCR was performed for 20 to 35 cycles using 1 ul of a 1:50
dilution of the primary PCR as template, a nested forward primer and
the assay-speciﬁc reverse primer. PCR products were run on a 2% agar-
ose gel. Gene-speciﬁc oligonucleotides were also used to help estimate the
size of the 3’UTR without any poly(A) tail. The lower part of the smear
or single band were excised from the gel, column puriﬁed (Qiagen
MinElute Gel Extraction Kit), shotgun cloned (Promega pGEM-T
Easy Vector System I) and sequence veriﬁed.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To distinguish between true and false pA sites in oligo—dT primed
deep sequencing data, we trained a naive Bayes classiﬁer using
deﬁned True Positive and True Negative sites. Given the demon-
strated technical rigor of 3pseq, True Positives were deﬁned as
the intersection of 3’ ends identiﬁed by both 3pseq and PAS-Seq
datasets from the same stage of zebrafish embryos
(Supplementary Fig. SlA). True Negatives were derived from
oligo-dT primed RNA-Seq reads with at least ﬁve genomically
templated terminal adenines or proximal thymines and were not
present in 3pseq (Supplementary Fig. SlA). The training set
consists of 22 770 True Positives and 9219 True Negatives,

Accurate identification of polyadenylation sites from 3’ end deep sequencing using a naive Bayes classifier

 

representing the majority of zebraﬁsh-coding genes (data not
shown). As expected of pA sites (Graber et al., 1999), True
Positives exhibited a prevalence of adenines and thymines
upstream of the cleavage site (Fig. 1A) and a canonical PAS
clustered near the 3’ end (Fig. 1B and C). Downstream of the
pA site we noted thymine and a slight enrichment of guanine
(Fig. 1A). By contrast, True Negative sites failed to exhibit char-
acteristics associated with pA sites (Fig. 1D and E), and the small
fraction of PASs in these sequences did not cluster near the 3’
end (Fig. 1F and G).

3.1 Algorithm training and performance

To delineate the True Positives from the True Negatives, we
chose algorithm features to represent sequence elements known
to direct cleavage and polyadenylation (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). In the upstream sequence region, this included all hexamer
permutations to allow for self-discovery of potential canonical
and variant PASs and uracil-rich elements (Supplementary Fig.
S2B). Downstream of a putative cleavage site, guanine/uracil- or
uracil-rich elements may signify a true pA site (Proudfoot, 2011),
while adenine richness may indicate internal oligo-dT priming.
Therefore, we also included mono- and di-nucleotide counts, as
well as the average distance of the adenines to the pA site, as
features (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The upstream features were
modeled as a binomial distribution and the downstream features
were modeled as a normal distribution. The relative importance
of each feature is listed in Supplementary Table S2A. As ex-
pected, canonical PASs, AATAAA and ATTAAA, are among
the top four most important binary features (Supplementary
Table S2A), while downstream T/ GT rich elements, adenine rich-
ness and proximity to the pA site are among the most important
continuous features (Supplemental Table S2B). Variant PASs
also aid in identiﬁcation of true pA sites (Supplemental Table
S2C: top 200 positive hexamers upstream). Variation of up-
(2(%50 nt) and downstream (3&50 nt) sequence lengths for
these features (Supplementary Fig. S2C) demonstrated low vari-
ability between the different models (Supplementary Table S1).
We chose 40 nt of upstream sequence, as not to miss any possible
PASs in the upstream region due to variations in cleavage site
usage, and 30 nt downstream for subsequent training (Pauws
et al., 2001).

To develop and test the naive Bayes classiﬁer, we randomly
sampled 70% of the training set to build the classiﬁer (training)
and the remaining 30% to evaluate performance (cross-valid-
ation) and averaged the results of 10 trials. Following training,
we found that the naive Bayes classiﬁer recalled 92.2% of True
Negatives (true negative rate, Table 1 and Fig. 2A) and 93.8% of
True Positives (recall, Table 1 and Fig. 2B), while it incorrectly
categorized only 3.2% of predicted positives (false discovery rate,
Table 1 and Fig. 2C). By contrast, a heuristic ﬁlter deﬁned as 8
or more adenines in 10nt downstream of the pA site (referred to
hereafter as 8A) generally performed worse at identifying True
Negatives and False positives, although recall with this filter was
quite good (Fig. 2 and Table 1). While removing all sites without
a putative PAS in combination with the 8A filter (PAS+8A)
improved performance (Fig. 2A7C), the naive Bayes classiﬁer
generally outperformed both of these heuristic filters, as deter-
mined by MCC, a balanced measure of true positives, false

the size of the training set may lead to over-ﬁtting due to
biased sequence composition, algorithm performance was similar
using 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90% of the True Positives and True
Negatives for training (Supplementary Fig. S3), demonstrating
that our initial training set was of sufﬁcient size. Taken together,
the naive Bayes classiﬁer outperforms the heuristic ﬁlters on
these initial training and cross-validation sets. Furthermore,
the increased speciﬁcity appears to come with little cost to
sensitivity.

3.2 Application to PAS-Seq data

To more generally test the performance of the naive Bayes clas-
sifier, we used all True Positives and True Negatives to build the
classiﬁer and used it to categorize unﬁltered oligo-dT primed 3’
end deep sequencing (PAS-Seq) data from 24 hpf zebrafish
embryos. Genomic sequence ﬂanking 3’ ends from unﬁltered

PAS-Seq data shows enrichment for adenines upstream and
downstream of the pA site (Fig. 3A), similar to our True
Negative training set (see Fig. 1D and E; rA=0.89, rC=0.78,
r0 = 0.79, rT = 0.76). Furthermore, we failed to identify a canon-
ical PAS as an over-represented motif upstream of putative pA
sites in unfiltered PAS-Seq data (Fig. 3A). Indeed, only 20.6% of
the putative pA sites contain an upstream AATAAA and 55.4%
have no identiﬁable PAS (Fig. 3B). Thus, this dataset likely con-
tains a high proportion of sequences derived from internal oligo-
dT priming. Filtering these data with the trained naive Bayes
classiﬁer calls 65.4% of putative pA sites from PAS-Seq as
false, and the nucleotide proﬁle of pA sites called true resembled
that of pA sites identiﬁed at the same developmental stage by the
more technically rigorous 3pseq approach (compare Fig. 3C and
D; rA = 0.83, rc = 0.68, r0 = 0.85, rT = 0.86). Similar upstream
(canonical PAS) and downstream sequence (guanine/thymine-
rich) elements were also easily identiﬁed in both 3pseq and fil-
tered PAS-Seq datasets (Fig. 3C and D). In all, 49% of the true
pA sites called by the classiﬁer contain AATAAA and only
19.2% have no PAS, in agreement with genome-wide PAS dis-
tributions (Li et al., 2012; Ulitsky et al., 2012) and similar to
3pseq data (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the naive Bayes classiﬁer,
categorizing PAS-Seq using the 8A heuristic filter classiﬁed only
18.1% of putative pA sites as false, leading to only slightly better
correlation of sequence composition of the remaining sites with
those from 3pseq data (rA = 0.45, rC = 0.12, r0 = 0.65, rT = 0.61)
compared with the unﬁltered PAS-Seq. However, the adenine
richness in the downstream sequence region and lack of identi-
ﬁable consensus PAS suggest a large number of internally oligo-
dT primed sites are called as positives after applying the 8A ﬁlter
(Fig. 3B and E). The PAS+ 8A heuristic ﬁlter performs better
than the 8A ﬁlter, likely by excluding more false positives
(rA = 0.76, rC = 0.57, rG = 0.83, rT = 0.82; Fig. 3F). However,

based on its strict deﬁnition, the PAS + 8A filter eliminates all
true pA sites that do not contain a consensus PAS (Fig. 3B).
Together, these results demonstrate that our naive Bayes classi-
fier performs better than heuristic ﬁlters, resulting in a set of
putative pA sites that closely resembles 3pseq. Importantly, our
classiﬁer is also able to identify 3’ ends that do not bear a con-
sensus PAS. Further examination of this subset reveals 53%
contain the top 50 positive hexamers upstream, and 74% contain
the top 100 positive hexamers upstream (Supplementary Table
S2C).

Comparison of the proportion of pA sites common to PAS-
Seq and 3pseq data in 24 hpf zebrafish embryos revealed an in-
crease from 13.0 to 35.7% after ﬁltering PAS-Seq data with the
naive Bayes classiﬁer (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, both common and
unique pA sites exhibit characteristics typical of true PAS
(Fig. 4B7D), although those unique to only 3pseq or PAS-Seq
datasets show a higher proportion of variant PAS usage
(Fig. 4E). The occurrence of these sites in only 3pseq or PAS-
Seq datasets may be due to low levels of expression that are not
consistently detected at this sequencing depth. Accordingly, pA
sites common to PAS-Seq and 3pseq comprise signiﬁcantly
(P<2.2e-16) more sequencing reads than those unique to
either PAS-Seq (mean of 288.69 versus 8.85) or 3pseq (mean of
204.94 versus 21.4; Fig. 4F). Other technical issues may also

speciﬁc reverse primer was used for the lanes labeled ‘PAT Assay R’.
Total RNA from 24hpf whole embryos was used for biological valid-
ation. Confusion matrices for biologically validated sites compared with
(E) naive Bayes classiﬁer or (F) 8A ﬁlter

contribute to a pA site being uniquely found in either dataset.
For example, internal oligo-dT binding may block extension
from an oligo-dT bound to the poly(A) tail (Nam et al., 2002),
thus inhibiting identiﬁcation of true 3’ ends in adenine-rich gen-
omic loci in PAS-Seq. Variable PAS usage due to polymorphisms
between the zebrafish strains used to generate the PAS-Seq and
3pseq datasets may also be possible (Howe et al., 2013).

To biologically cross-validate the in silico predictions, we con-
ducted two different poly(A) tail length (PAT) assays to verify a
putative pA site. In the G—tailed PAT assay (GPAT), yeast
poly(A) polymerase is used to ligate guanosines and inosines
to the 3’ end of polyadenylated RNA, followed by reverse tran-
scription with an anchored poly-cytosine primer (Fig. 5A). Alter-
natively, an oligo-dT containing primer was used for reverse
transcription (dtPAT; Fig. 5B) (Murray and Schoenberg,
2008). In both assays, nested PCR was performed using a
gene-specific forward primer and an assay-speciﬁc reverse
primer to amplify the 3’ end of the transcript including the

poly(A) tail, as well as gene-speciﬁc forward and reverse primers
to amplify fragments without the poly(A) tail (Fig. 5A and B).
Due to different poly(A) tail lengths or variable oligo-dT binding
along the poly(A) tail, validation of a true 3’ end resulted in a
smear on an agarose gel in both assays (Fig. 5A7C). Conversely,
an internally primed site will result in no product in the GPAT
assay and a single product in the dtPAT assay (Fig. 5A, B and
D). We applied GPAT and dtPAT assays to 50 putative pA sites
in the zebraﬁsh genome deﬁned by our classiﬁer (Supplementary
Table S3). Forty-two of these sites were called True by the clas-
sifier, of which 22 corresponded to annotated 3’ UTRs (ZV9,
ENSEMBL V68) and 20 represented novel 3’ ends. All of these
True sites were ampliﬁed using the GPAT assay, indicating these
are true polyadenylated 3’ ends (Fig. 5C and E; Supplementary
Table S3), including 11 novel 3’ ends that were identiﬁed by
24 hpf PAS-Seq but not 24 hpf 3pseq. Thirteen validated True
sites contained PASs other than the canonical AAUAAA within
40 nt upstream of the cleavage site and one lacked any consensus
motif, demonstrating that our classiﬁer can identify 3’ ends with-
out a consensus PAS (Supplementary Table S3).

Along with the putative True set, we assayed eight sites that
were classiﬁed as False, only one of which was annotated as a 3’
end in ENSEMBL (Supplementary Table S3). Half of these sites
displayed a variant PAS near the putative 3’ end, while the re-
maining sites contained no PAS 40 nt upstream. Seven out of the
eight sites classiﬁed as False failed to amplify in the GPAT assay,
but were detected by dtPAT suggesting that they arise from in-
ternal oligo-dT priming (Supplementary Table S3; Fig. 5D, E).
Furthermore, six of these sites contained fewer than eight aden-
ines in the downstream region and were called true by the 8A
heuristic ﬁlter (Fig. 5F; Supplementary Table S3). One False site,
which did not possess a consensus PAS and contained only
three downstream adenines, was ampliﬁed by the GPAT assay
(Fig. 5E). Together, our biological cross-validation of putative
pA sites demonstrates the high accuracy of the naive Bayes clas-
sifier. Importantly, our classiﬁer facilitated the identiﬁcation of
novel pA sites from PAS-Seq allowing the discovery of new
3’ UTRs in the zebraﬁsh transcriptome.

3.3 Naive Bayes classiﬁer displays utility in other species

To determine whether our algorithm, which was trained using
zebrafish datasets, could be applied to other species, we used it to
ﬁlter mammalian datasets generated using polyA-seq, an alter-
native oligo-dT primed 3’ end sequence method (Derti et al.,
2012; see following and data not shown). In this previous
study, data were ﬁltered using an empirically derived threshold
of a log ratio, calculated as a product of mono-nucleotide fre-
quencies in the 10 nt downstream of putative 3’ ends relative to
those from internal priming sites (referred to hereafter as the
‘Derti ﬁlter’). As a metric to assess the efﬁcacy of our classiﬁer,
we compared the results of ﬁltering polyA-seq data with the
naive Bayes classiﬁer to the output of the Derti ﬁlter. For ex-
ample, unﬁltered polyA-seq data from human kidney exhibited
similarities to our negative training set, consistent with internal
oligo-dT priming (Fig. 6A). From approximately half million
putative 3’ ends in the unﬁltered data, application of the naive
Bayes classiﬁer identiﬁed >130 000 pA sites, which exhibited the
expected characteristics for true polyadenylated 3’ ends (Fig. 6B).

In comparison, the Derti ﬁlter (Derti et al., 2012) classiﬁed
94 945 as true pA sites, which also exhibited the expected
sequence patterns (Fig. 6C). Of these, approximately 77 000
were commonly assigned by the two filtering methods
(Fig. 6D). Closer inspection revealed that nearly all pA sites
identiﬁed uniquely by the Derti filter have fewer than 5 adenines
in the 10 nt downstream (Fig. 6E), consistent with the focus of
this ﬁlter on nucleotide frequencies in the downstream region
(Derti et al., 2012). In comparison, our naive Bayes classiﬁer
identiﬁes pA sites with all proportions of adenines in the down-
stream region, including 54 046 true pA sites called false by the
Derti ﬁlter (Derti et al., 2012). Importantly, the majority of sites
uniquely identiﬁed by our classiﬁer possess a canonical PAS,
suggesting that they are true 3/ ends (Fig. 6F). By contrast, the
majority of true sites uniquely identiﬁed by the Derti filter did
not display a PAS in the upstream region (Fig. 6F), suggesting
that many may be false-positive calls. However, without biolo-
gical cross-validation, it is difﬁcult to assess the false-positive rate
within this group. In any event, these observations suggest that
our naive Bayes classiﬁer, trained on zebraﬁsh 3/ end sequencing
data, performs well in the identification of pA sites from mam-
malian species. Furthermore, our classiﬁer discovered many
more likely true positive pA sites from unﬁltered data than the
Derti ﬁlter. This is likely due to the interrogation and analysis of
multiple sequence elements during the training of this classiﬁer,
while the Derti filter is restricted to consideration of only mono-
nucleotide frequencies immediately downstream of the pA.
Based on our work, a trained naive Bayes classiﬁer is clearly
beneﬁcial to identify true pA sites from oligo-dT primed 3/ end

sequencing data from both zebraﬁsh and other animal species.
Additionally, this approach may also be helpful to assess and
improve the quality of 3/ ends of RNA-seq transcript models
built from standard transcript annotation software, such as
Cufﬂinks or Scripture (Guttman et al., 2010; Trapnell et al.
2010). Indeed, application of our classiﬁer to previously pub-
lished RNA-seq transcript models from zebrafish (Pauli et al.,
2012) suggests a signiﬁcant number of transcript ends may be
due to internal oligo-dT priming, while ﬁltering enriches for ca-
nonical and variant PAS hexamers (Supplementary Fig. S4). The
usage of our classiﬁer could also be extended to RefSeq and
other sequence databases, as these gene models have been largely
built from oligo-dT primed cDNAs and likely contain a signiﬁ-
cant number of incorrect 3/ end annotations. Indeed, an esti-
mated 12% of ESTs labeled as 3/ ends in dbEST human
(release October 04, 2001) are due to internal oligo-dT priming
(Nam et al., 2002), and our naive Bayes classiﬁer correctly pre-
dicted that the 3/ end of vegfc, as annotated by ENSEMBL in the
zebrafish genome (ZV9), is due to mis-priming (Supplementary
Table S3). Thus, naive Bayes ﬁltering of annotated sequences in
available databases, in addition to previously published genome-
wide oligo-dT primed sequencing data, will likely lead to identi-
fication of new pA sites and eliminate false internally primed
sites. Further studies are needed to assess the performance of
the naive Bayes classiﬁer, trained on zebrafish data, in yeast
and plants. In conclusion, the naive Bayes classiﬁer developed
in these studies will facilitate the identiﬁcation of novel pA sites
in combination with simple oligo-dT primed 3/ end sequencing.

VegaMC

 

data represents a challenging task. Results are publicly available
and they can be used for further investigations.

2 VEGAMC

VegaMC extends the variational segmentation algorithm pro—
posed in Morganella et a]. (2010) in order to simultaneously
perform the segmentation of all the samples. The joint segmen—
tation allows better results to be obtained both in terms of ac—
curacy, since the detection of copy number breakpoints can be
based on the evidence from multiple signals, and in terms of
computational efﬁciency as reported in the results. Joint segmen—
tation allows the enhancement of systematic biases leading to the
appearance of consistent breakpoints. The segmented regions are
then classiﬁed, sample by sample, as deletions, ampliﬁcations
and LOH and a statistical framework is used to assess the stat—
istical signiﬁcance associated with driver CNA. The statistical
framework is based on a conservative permutation test similar
to the one previously described in Morganella et a]. (2011) per—
formed on at region level (see Supplementary Information for
more algorithmic details).

One aim of VegaMC is to solve some critical points arising
from the analysis process depicted in Supplementary Figure S1.
The ﬁrst issue of this analysis process is the integration of differ—
ent software tools. Integration is not an easy step: software tools
are implemented in different programming languages and output
of a tool needs to be adapted so that it can be used as input for
the next tool. In order to overcome this problem, VegaMC has
been designed so that it is completely compatible with the most
used tools that compute LRR and BAF, such as, PennCNV—Affy
(Wang et al., 2007) and BeadStudio (www.illumina.com). In add—
ition, VegaMC performs all steps required for a comprehensive
analysis of high—density aCGH data: from segmentation of LRR
and BAF to the list of driver genes. All the computational de—
manding steps of VegaMC have been implemented in C, we
report later the execution times on huge datasets. Below, we
summarize the main features of VegaMC:

0 Integration with the output of PennCNV—Affy and
Beadstudio.

0 Designed to overcome several steps of the analysis process:
from LRR and BAF to the list of driver genes.

0 Efﬁcient implementation to guarantee execution times which
can cope with very large datasets.

0 User friendly: implemented as a R/Bioconductor package;
web pages are used to allow a rapid navigation of the results;
for each driver gene several pieces of information are pro—
vided (among them, the user finds the gene symbol, the gen—
omic position, the cytoband, the description and the link to
the respective ensembl web page).

3 RESULTS

In order to perform a quantitative evaluation of VegaMC, we
used a public synthetic dataset (Morganella et al., 2011) that
simulates CNA in different resolution scenarios and in different

noise conditions (biological and experimental noise was simu—
lated to perturb the data, see Supplementary Information).
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 show that VegaMC provides
good results in all simulated scenarios performance of VegaMC
is always comparable to the best performance of other
algorithms.

Qualitative evaluation of VegaMC has been performed on two
TCGA datasets: COAD and GBM. Datasets are composed of
424 COAD samples and 571 GBM samples, and paired intensi—
ties of tumor—normal samples are used to compute LRR and
BAF (see Supplementary Information). We report the time
required to perform the analyses: ~14’ for COAD and ~18’
for GBM using a Linux server equipped with 2.00 GHz
Xeon—Intel E7540 CPU. The results of the analysis can be
accessed at the webpage http://www.dsba.unisannio.
it/Members/ceccarelli/vegamc/. Results on COAD reveal
common cytogenetic mutations, such as, ampliﬁcation of 8q, 7,
13, 20q, X and deletion on 8p, 15q, 17p and 18q mutations which
include several well—known tumor suppressors (T P53, SMAD2,
SMAD3 and SMAD4) and oncogenes (MYC, GNAS,LM07)
(Ashktorab et al., 2010). Also, results on GBM contain many
positive controls, such as, cytogenetic deletions of 9p, 10, 17q
(including tumor suppressors PT EN and CDKN2A) and ampli—
ﬁcation of chromosome 7 (with evident instability of 7p11.2 that
includes the oncogene EGFR) (McLendon et al., 2008). In order
to evaluate the biological coherence of the lists of driver genes,
we investigated enriched canonical pathways and functions
(Supplementary Fig. S2 and S3); for COAD, we ﬁnd
‘Pancreatic Adenocarcinome Signaling’ to be signiﬁcant and
for GBM, we ﬁnd both ‘Glioma Signaling’ and ‘Glioblastoma
Multiforme Signaling’.

Finally, Supplementary Table S3 reports an experimental com—
parison in terms of running times on synthetic and real dataset.
The reported times show that VegaMC outperforms several al—
ternative algorithms aimed at computing recurrent genomic
aberrations.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We presented a new bioconductor/package for the analysis of
high—density aCGH data. VegaMC is integrated with common
LRR and BAF calculation tools and it performs all analysis steps
required to obtain the list of driver genes by exploiting a novel
multichannel segmentation algorithm characterized by efﬁciency
and accuracy. It also enables an easy navigation of the results by
html pages.

We performed analysis of two large TCGA datasets. The ob—
tained gene lists contain several positive controls that highlight
important signaling pathways. Results are publicly available for
download and they can be used as basis for further biological
investigations.

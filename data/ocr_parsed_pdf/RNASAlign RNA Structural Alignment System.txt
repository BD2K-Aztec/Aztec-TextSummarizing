ABSTRACT

Motivation: Structural alignment of RNA is found to be a useful
computational technique for idenitfying non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).
However, existing tools do not handle structures with pseudoknots.
Although algorithms exist that can handle structural alignment for
different types of pseudoknots, no software tools are available and
users have to determine the type of pseudoknots to select the
appropriate algoirthm to use which limits the usage of structural
alignment in identifying novel ncRNAs.

Results: We implemented the first web server, RNASAlign, which can
automatically identify the pseudoknot type of a secondary structure
and perform structural alignment of a folded RNA with every region of
a target DNA/RNA sequence. Regions with high similarity scores and
low e-values, together with the detailed alignments will be reported
to the user. Experiments on more than 350 ncRNA families show that
RNASAlign is effective.

1 INTRODUCTION

Structural alignment is an important topic in studying RNAs
especially for non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) which are found to be
evolutionary conserved in terms of primary sequences and secondary
structures. To Check if a given sequence (target) contains regions
that are possibly candidates of a particular ncRNA family, a useful
computational approach is to compute the structural alignment
between a folded ncRNA (query) of the family and every unfolded
region in the target sequence where the alignment score represents
their sequence and structural similarity. The approach has been
shown to be effective (Han et al., 2008; Wong et al., 2011). Some
existing software such as RSEARCH (Klein and Eddy, 2003) and
FASTR (Zhang et (11., 2005) belongs to this category.

However, the approach is not being widely used partially due to
the followings. First, the available tools (RSEARCH and FASTR)
do not support query with pseduoknots. The secondary structure
of an ncRNA is said to contain a pseudoknot if there are two
base pairs at positions (i,j) and (i’,j’), where i<j and i’ <j’, such
that i<i’<j <j’ or i’<i<j’<j. Secondary structures including
pseudoknots are found to be critical in some biological functions
(Adams et al., 2004; Dam et (11., 1992). Secondly, although there

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

are algorithms for computing the structural alignment for different
types of pseudoknots, no software tools are available. Thirdly, each
of these algorithms is designed for a speciﬁc pseudoknot type, the
user has to know the pseudoknot type of the query to select the
appropriate algorithm for performing the structural alignment. When
the query is long, it may not be a trivial problem for the user.

In this note, we introduce the ﬁrst web server RNASAlign
designed for this purpose. The user only requires to input a query
RNA sequence together with its secondary structure and a target
DNA/RNA sequence. The system will automatically identify the
pseudoknot type of the query structure and perform the structural
alignment between the query and every region of the target sequence.
The system supports regular structure (without pseudoknots) and a
wide range of pseudoknots such as stande pseudoknot, embedded
standard pseudoknot, recursive stande pseudoknot, simple non-
standard pseudoknot and recursive simple non-standard pseudoknot
[for the deﬁnitions of different pseudoknot types, please refer to
Wong et al. (2011); Zhang et a1. (2005) or the help page of
the web server]. According to our experiment of more than 350
ncRNA families, RNASAlign is effective in identifying ncRNAs
and achieves an average sensitivity of 95% when considering the
top 100 reported candidates.

2 METHODS

There are three major components of the system. The system ﬁrst analyzes
the secondary structure of the input query to classify the structure as a
regular structure or one of the known pseudoknot types. This is not a trivial
problem. We designed efﬁcient algorithms to solve this classiﬁcation problem
(see the help page for more details). We implemented all algorithms for
structural alignments of different pseudoknot types (Wong et al.. 2011. ’2).
All these algorithms use dynamic programming approach and give an optimal
solution for the alignment. We use ‘RIBOSUM85-60’ as the scoring matrix
(Klein and Eddy. 2003). Once the pseudoknot type is determined. the system
will perform the structural alignment between the folded query and every
unfolded region (with similar length as the query) of the target sequence
using the appropriate program. Besides the structural alignment score. we
also compute the corresponding e-Value according to the method suggested
by (Klein and Eddy. 2003). The alignment scores are assumed to follow the
Gumbel distribution and the e-Value represents the expected number of hits
with score greater than the resulting score. Finally. the system will report
all regions with e-Value below a user-deﬁned threshold (the default is 0.1)
together with the detailed alignment of the region and the query.

3 USAGE EXAMPLE

The input to the system includes a query sequence with its secondary
structure and a target sequence. We use a member of the family

Fig. 2. The alignment between the query and each target region.

Mammalian CPEB3 ribozyme (RF00622) as a query example and
the structure is of a recursive simple non-standard pseudoknot. We
use a 200 nt long sequence as an example target sequence. Figure 1
shows the summary of the result with the alignment scores and the
e-values for a set of regions in the target sequence. The results are
sorted in decreasing alignment scores. The summary also shows the
percentages of conserved base pairs, sequence identities and gaps
between the query and the region.

RNASAlign also lists the detailed alignment between the query
and each reported regions (Fig. 2). The alignment indicates the
conserved sequence between the query and the region by using
symbol ‘| ’. Also, when the user moves the curser over the base pair,
the base pair will be highlighted in yellow if the base pair appears
in both query and the target region, while it will be highlighted in
red if it only appears in the query but not in the target region.

RNASAlign is installed in a server with one quad-core CPU and
16G memory. It can handle four simultaneous queries at the same
time. As shown in Table 1, a query with length 70—90 usually takes
around half an hour for structurally aligning with a target sequence
of length 500 or around 1 h for a target of length 1000. It will take
longer if the query includes a non-standard pseudoknotted structure.

4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We selected a set of families in Rfam 10.1 database for which
the lengths of the consensus structures are 3150 long and they
have >100 members. There are over 350 families. For each family,
we randomly picked one of the members as the query and we
constructed a long random sequence of length about 200 times the
length of the query sequence. The random sequence was generated
with same probability for all Characters A,C,G,U. Then we embedded
100 of the members into this long random sequence in arbitrary
positions. This is our target sequence. For each family, we inputted
the query and the target into RNASAlign, and we Checked the ﬁrst

350 families is 95. Table 2 shows the results of some families (see
the help page for a full list). We also compare our programs with
those without considering pseudoknots. We repeated the experiment
on BLAST (with default parameters), a sequence-only software, and
FASTR, a pseudoknot-free structural alignment method. Results are
shown in Table 2. Note that that both BLAST and FASTR run very
fast (<1 s).

In addition, the use of pedigree information is effective not only
for phasing but also for estimating variant positions because low
coverage regions in each individual are supported by sequence
reads covering the same regions in other individuals via pedigree
information. From the synergistic effect by the use of phase—
informative reads and pedigree information, more accurate
variant calling is expected in our proposed approach than
other variant callers estimating variants independently on pos—
itions and individuals.

In the haplotyping process of our approach, sequence reads
are assigned to a more probable haplotype between two haplo—
types based on a binomial model, and heterozygous positions are
phased by the assigned reads spanning multiple heterozygous
positions.

Although homozygous positions are not informative for phas—
ing and cannot be used to distinguish between haplotypes, they
are also used for data for the binomial model for phasing.
Because the majority of positions are homozygous, information
from heterozygous positions is weakened and assignment of
reads to haplotypes can be misled. To address this issue, we
introduce latent variables that determine zygosity at each pos—
ition to the model. By filtering out the information from highly
probably homozygous positions by using the latent variables,
only information from heterozygous positions is selectively
used for phasing.

The remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows. We
describe a statistical model of our proposed approach and pro—
vide how the parameters and genotypes are estimated in Section
2. In Section 3, we compare the performance of our proposed
approach and other existing variant callers through a simulation
data analysis and real data analysis with human whole—genome
sequencing data from Illumina HiSeq 2000 and SNP array gen—
otyping results from Illumina OMNI 2.5 BeadChip. We ﬁnally
discuss and conclude the performance evaluation results and
effective points of our approach in Section 4.

2 METHODS

Our approach uses mapped sequence reads to a reference genome on the
SAM/BAM format and pedigree information of individuals as input
data, and then variant calling results are returned in variant calling
format (VCF) (Danecek et al., 2011) after the estimation. The model of
our approach comprises three parts: allele likelihood part, pedigree part
and haplotype selection part. Allele likelihood part represents a likelihood
function of an allele, given aligned reads at a position under the consid-
eration of sequencing errors and mapping errors. Pedigree part represents
the allele transmission from parents to offspring, and haplotype selection
part represents selection of haplotype from which sequence reads are
generated. In the following sections, we describe the details of these
three parts and procedures for parameter estimation and genotype infer-
ence in the proposed model.

2.1 Allele likelihood part

Let Rx,- be the ith read in a SAM/BAM ﬁle for individual X. Rx,- contains
its mapping quality score in Phred scale MAPQxi, strings for bases
aligned to position k in the reference genome I"; and vectors of base
quality scores in Phred scale for the aligned bases bqﬁi. Note that rﬁi is
just one nucleotide such as ‘T’ in many cases, but it can be a string with
more than one nucleotide for representing insertion, e.g. a string ‘TGC’
represents an insertion ‘GC’ right after a base ‘T’. The Hi, can also be a

string of length 0 to represent deletion. By using these notations, we give a
likelihood function for allele A at position k as:

Pom/4.22512) = Z Z P(r:i.»IA,b:i.»)""7'“:”
14,20. 1 "111,20. 1 (1)
A. 1(m’{.:0) A. A. .
XPmiV(rxi) U P(n1xi)P(b/rilbq:i)’
where mil. is a binary variable that takes 1 if the alignment of rﬁi is correct
and 0 otherwise. The term bit. is a vector of binary variables, and each
element indicates the correctness of each base in If.” i.e. if sequencing of a
base is correct, the corresponding element takes 1 and 0 otherwise. The
term I(-) is an indicator function that returns 1 if condition in its argu-
ment is true, and 0 otherwise. As with rﬁi, allele A is represented by a
string with nucleotides ‘A’, ‘T’, ‘G’ and ‘C’. The term P(r’;l.|A,b’;i) in
Equation (1) is the probability of read generation for the correct read
alignment, and we represent the probability as:
1nin(\A1.1zJ;j,.1)
P(r:i,»IA,b:i.) = Inde1(A,r:i.) H P01111141], him).
1:1

where A[[] is the 1th nucleotide of A, rﬁiﬂ] is the 1th nucleotide of rﬁi, bﬁiU]
is the 1th value of bit. and function Indel represents read skip errors and
insertion errors. |- | takes a string or set as its argument and returns
length for string or size for set, e.g. |ATG| = 3. We model function
Indel by using read skip error rate 8 and insertion error rate 1 as:

Indel(A,r:l.) = 51<1A1>W>(1 _ 5)’(‘A‘5"if"
XLIQAKMWU _[)1(1A12111;1,-l)-

In this study, we set 8 and l to 0.001. P(I’;i[[]|A[[],b’;i[[]) models base
substitution error on each base and is given by:

1 rill] =A[11&b:i.»[11=1
P(r:i.»UJIAUJ,b:i,»UJ)= 1/3 rainyéAmmiiivbo.
0 otherwise

Pm(r:i) represents the probability of read generation for misaligned
reads. We consider that reads representing indels, i.e. reads with 0 length
or >1 nt are generated more probably than reads with lnt in the mis-
alignment, and design Pmm(r’;i) as:

. l/N . |r’"..| :1
P [V ,A“ 2 mm M . 5 [V > 
"7‘ (IN) {pmiV/Nmm otherw1se pm‘ 7

Here, Nmis is the normalization factor given by 2,164le 1’<‘A‘=”pf,5‘,;“*”,

where AM. is a set of possible alleles for individual X at position k. AM. is
given by {‘A’, ‘T’, ‘G’, ‘C’}U null string for deletion. In addition, if there
exist reads with nucleotides more than one aligned at position k, the
corresponding sequences are added, AM. In this study, we set pm“ to
1.0, i.e. we assume that the read is generated from possible alleles equally
probably. P(b’;i|bq’;i) is factorized as H1P(b’;i[[]|bq’;i[[]), and each term is
given by a binomial distribution with parameter 1 — 10”"1iIW 10:

P(b::.[mbq:.m> = [1 — lore-W10]

. 17k. :0
x [10*bq’:.,-m/10]1( “m )

1<I>’:.,-UJ=1>

P(m’;l.) is given by a binomial distribution with parameter 17ml, We also
give a beta distribution with parameters am(1 — 10’1"“ QW/ 10) and
01,,110’1‘4APQ‘7/10 as prior distributions of 17ml, Thus, 17mg is updated by
considering both probability for alignment reliability of read I"; from the
model and mapping quality score MAPQxi. We set prior strength am to 10.

2.2 Pedigree part

Pedigree part considers statistical relationship among the genotype of
individuals in a pedigree. Here, we consider a model of a parentichild

trio with child 6, mother m and father f. Let ka be a genotype
(A1 A3,) at position k for individual X e {c,m,f}. We also let tmk

Xk’
and [M be binary variables that take 1 or 2 to indicate the allele trans-
mission to the offspring, e.g. if tmk is 1, A3"), is transmitted to the off-
spring. The joint probability of genotypes for child, mother and father
is factorized as:

P(Gck, GM», Gmkltfka lmk) = P(Gck|Gmka GM», [ﬂu lmk)
x Pompom)
P(GC,‘. |Gm,‘., GM, 1)k,tmk) represents allele transmission, and we model it as:
1 1 I(tm/Fl)
P(Gck|Gmka GM», [ﬂu lmk) = P(AC,‘. lAmk; 8)

1 11,1122)
Air/{Mimi 8)( I

1(1 1:1)
Aim/411:8) ”
>< P(AZ,‘,|Af2k; 8)1(!/":2)

><P(
><P(

The conditional probability P(A3,,‘, |A,1n,‘,; a) is given by:

l _ l
Ack _ Amk

1 1 t _ l — a
P(Ack|Amk’ 8) _ { 5 otherwise i

where a is de novo mutation rate including both germline and somatic
mutation rate. We set a to 2.5 X 10’7 based on the assumption about de
novo mutation rate in the genome-wide mutation study of parenti
offspring trio sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project
(Cartwright et al., 2012; Conrad et al., 2011). For considering chromo-
somal recombination, we give a probability on transition of tmk between
positions by:

Pumkltmkil) = T1(1,nk¢1,nk,.)(1 _ T)1(’mlz:’mlzrl)’

where r is chromosomal recombination rate. We set I to 10’s, as 1 cM is
on average~106 bp in human genome (Collins et al., 1996). For prior
probabilities of founders’ genotypes Gmfand GM, we assume the following
factorization:

P(Gmk) = P(A3,.1)P(Aﬁ.1.) (2)

P(A,1n,‘,) is a prior distribution for allele frequency, and we use a distri-
bution considering reference allele and an empirical distribution from
aligned reads given by:

PM] A) : ﬁePek(A,1,,k,/€)+ MA}... = Ag”) + ﬁll/1AM,
m ﬁr ‘1‘ ﬂy! ‘1‘ ﬁll

where P“ is an empirical distribution for allele from aligned reads to
position k and A? is a reference allele at position k. ﬁe, ﬁr and ﬂu are
non-negative parameters for adjustment. For alleles in neither reference
allele nor aligned reads, uniform distribution l/lAmkl is considered. We
deal with [3,. as a position-dependent value and set it to the read depth at
each position, whereas ﬁr is set to the coverage of data. Because 1/1000
homologous positions are different between two chromosomes in empir-
ical rough estimate, we set ﬂu to 0.001 X ﬁr.

 

2.3 Haplotype selection part

Haplotyping part links allele likelihood part and pedigree part by select-
ing a haplotype from which read is generated. Given a genotype
GM. 2 (A1), ,Aik) at position k for individual X, haplotype selection

part selects an allele, from which each read is generated, by using
binary variable hf, in the following manner:

H Pan/41.,bqg>’“i=“P(r:1A:.,bq:»’<”=”P(h:.1 <3>
[62],;

where 1,). is a set of indexes of reads for individual X that contain aligned
reads at position k. In a simple setting, the allocation of each read to

haplotypes is equally probable and independent of positions, i.e.
P(h’;l. = 1) and P(h’;i = 2) are 0.5. Here, instead of P(h,.,»), we consider
a conditional probability P(h’;l.|zxk) given by:

17/7“. hi1»: 1&2” = l
P(h:i|Z/Vk) = 1 ‘17/71-1- hit 2 2&Zxk = 1 (4)
0.5 ZXA» = 0

where 17,”. is a rate for the assignment of read Rx,- to a haplotype and zxk is
a binary variable that determines zygosity at position k for individual X
and takes value 1 for heterozygote and 0 for homozygote. For paired-end
data, 17,,“ is shared in each read pair.

To represent zygosity with 2%, we introduce a conditional probability
P(zx,‘.|A1 Aik) that is given by:

Xk’

A1,, =A§k &zx;‘. = 0

1.0 or
P X. A1.,,A2.. =
(Z Al XA AA)  75   ZXk =1
0 otherw1se

The role of zxk is to ﬁlter out highly probably homozygous positions
from data for read assignment via Equation (4), and hence only highly
probably heterozygous positions are used for haplotyping.

1717‘, represents one of the two chromosomes from which read Rx,-
comes. Because each read comes from one of the two homologous
chromosomes equally probably in an ideal condition, we represent this
property with the following formula:

H2121...) = N( 2121...; 1111.1/2,L'11111/4)
[Ely/1 [EL-I;

where N represents normal distribution and I: is the average read length.
2,61”: 1717‘, is considered as the number of reads from the same chromo-
some at position k. Because 21.61le 17/", is a continuous value, normal
approximation of a binomial distribution with parameter 0.5 is used.
Although the mean and variance of the normal distribution approximat-
ing a binomial distribution with parameter 0.5 are |ka|/2 and |ka|/4,
respectively, we set the variance to illxkl/4 to normalize the effect with
the average read length.

2.4 Parameter estimation and genotype inference

By using allele likelihood part, pedigree part and haplotype selection
part, the complete likelihood of our model is given in the following
formula:

[ H P(p/7\.l, 

Xe(c.m.f}

,ph.....>]P(rmo>P(zm>

where IX is a set of indexes of reads for individual X and
P(p/m, ...,p/7\W) is the joint probability of 17/", and proportional to
HA, HEEL/I 17,7“). In Equation (5), observed variables are rjd, bqﬁl. and
MAQxi, latent variables are txk, A1), A3,, zxk and hi, and parameters are
 and 17/71;-

Figure 1 gives a graphical representation of our proposed model,
where observed variables are in gray and latent variables and parameters
are in white. We use an EM algorithm for parameter estimation, as the
model contains many latent variables and the model structure of these
variables is complicated. In E-step, the calculation of the marginal prob-
abilities on latent variables such as hit. and zxk is required. However,
unlike usual hidden Markov models, exact probabilistic inference requires

Variant caller with pedigree information and local haplotyping

 

The BAM ﬁles for these datasets were obtained by mapping
the sequence reads to UCSC hgl9 reference genome for chromo—
some 21 with BWAiMEM (Li, 2013). To evaluate the perform—
ance of our proposed approach with various read coverage, we
downsampled the BAM ﬁles with Picard DownsampleSam
(http://picard.sourceforge.net/) and obtained BAM ﬁles with
read coverage of 5, 10, 20 and 40x for each individual. These
downsampled BAM files were realigned with Genome Analysis
Toolkit(GATK) Indel Realigner (DePristo et al., 2011).

For the comparison with existing approaches, we used the
following four methods: GATK Unifled Genotyper (DePristo
et al., 2011; McKenna et al., 2010), BCFtools with SAMtools
mpileup (Li et al., 2009), TrioCaller (Chen et al., 2013)and
PolyMutt (Li et al., 2012). In Unif1ed Genotyper and
SAMtools, variant calling is performed for each individual inde—
pendently, i.e. no pedigree information is considered. TrioCaller
takes variant calling results from other callers as input data, and
re—estimates variants by considering pedigree information and

linkage disequilibrium. Note that linkage disequilibrium infor—
mation is limited in this experiment, as only three individuals
are considered. For the input of TrioCaller, we used results
from SAMtools as is in the instruction of TrioCaller users’
example. PolyMutt takes genotype likelihood information from
other variant callers as its input data, and estimates variants by
considering pedigree information. As is instructed in PolyMutt
web page, we obtained likelihood information from SAMtools in
Genotype Likelihood Format (GLF) and used it as the input
data of PolyMutt. We used Unified Genotyper and PolyMutt
with default options. For SAMtools/BCFtools, we used the com—
mands described in SAMtools Web site without variant filtering
with depth (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup.shtml). For
TrioCaller, we set ‘iround’ option to 100 and used default setting
for other options.

our proposed approach and these four methods: the numbers of
true positives (TPs), FPs, accuracy, recall, precision and F—

measure for the sequencing data with read coverage of 5 and
10><. Results for 20 and 40x are summarized in Section 2 of
the Supplementary Material. In variant detection, if a genotype
estimated at a position and true genotype at the position are not
homozygous for the reference allele, the estimated genotype is
counted as TP. On the other hand, if true genotype is homozy—
gous for the reference allele, the estimated genotype is counted as
FP. Note that TPs could contain estimated genotypes that are
different from their corresponding true genotypes, e. g. if an esti—
mated genotype and true genotype at a position with reference
allele A are (A, B) and (B, B), respectively, the estimated geno—
type is counted as TP. Recall and precision are given by f%
and %, respectively. F—measure is given by the har—
monic mean of recall and precision as 2 x W, nd
achieves overall performance by capturing the trade—off of
recall and precision. These measures are valued between 0 and
l, and larger value is better.

In all scenarios in Table l, PedigreeCaller outperforms other
methods in recall and F—measure. For the datasets with read
coverage of 10>< and read length of 100 bp, PolyMutt outper—
forms other methods including PedigreeCaller in precision. Also,
for the datasets with read coverage of 5x and read length of 100
and 500 bp, GATK outperforms other methods including
PedigreeCaller in precision. However, recalls of GATK in these
conditions are low and hence its F—measures are worse than those
of other methods. In the datasets, except for the conditions with
5x and 100 and 500 bp, precisions of PedigreeCaller are higher
than those of other methods.

To see the effect of read length to PedigreeCaller, we focus on
the difference on the performance between PedigreeCaller and
PolyMutt. For dataset with read coverage of 10>< and read
length of 100 bp, the number of TPs on PedigreeCaller is 616
more than that on PolyMutt, but the number of FPs on
PedigreeCaller is 46 more than that on PolyMutt. On the other
hand, for dataset with read coverage of 10>< and read length of
500 bp, the number of TPs on PedigreeCaller is 617 more than
that on PolyMutt and the number of FPs on PedigreeCaller is 27
less than that on PolyMutt. In addition, in the dataset with read
length of 1000 bp, the number of TPs on PedigreeCaller is 615
more than that on PolyMutt and the number of FPs on
PedigreeCaller is 65 less than that on PolyMutt.

Table 2 summarizes the performance of genotype concordance
on our proposed approach and four existing methods for the
sequencing data with read coverages of 5 and 10><. Results for
20 and 40x are summarized in Section 2 of the Supplementary
Material. In genotype concordance, if a genotype estimated at a
position and true genotype at the position are the same and not
homozygous for the reference allele, the estimated genotype is
counted as TP. On the other hand, if the genotype of the esti—
mated variant is different from the true genotype, the estimated
variant is counted as FP. Note that the recall and precision for
genotype concordance are respectively the same as sensitivity and
PPV used for evaluation of variant callers in You et a]. (2012).
Also, note that the number of trues is not equal to the sum of the
number of TPs and the number of false negatives (FNs) because
some trues can be in FPs.

Similar to variant detection, all the conditions in Table 2,
PedigreeCaller outperforms other methods in recall and
F—measure.

3.2 Real data analysis

To evaluate performance on real sequencing data, we use 100—bp
paired—end sequencing data of HapMap CEU parentioffspring
trio comprising NA12878 (child), NA12891 (father) and
NA12892 (mother) (Conrad et al., 2011). The data were
sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2000 with read coverage of
45x for each individual, and stored as BAM flles after mapping
to UCSC hgl9 with BurrowsiWheeler Aligner (Li and Durbin,
2009). The average insert size is ~300 bp.

We downsampled the sequencing datasets to 5, 10, 20 and 40 x
for each individual with Picard DownsampleSam. These down—
sampled BAM files were realigned with GATK Indel Realigner,
and base quality scores are recalibrated with GATK Base
Quality Score Recalibration. We evaluate the performance by
assessing the concordance of estimated variants from these vari—
ant callers for datasets with various read coverages with SNP
array genotyping results from Illumina OMNI 2.5 BeadChip.
The number of SNP sites considered is 2310 349, and the
number of variants for these three individuals is 2122 147.

We also assessed the concordance with the 1000 Genomes
Project and commonly estimated variants by the five callers for
the dataset of 40x. Results for those cases are given in the
Supplementary Material.

Table 3 summarizes the performance of variant detection on
PedigreeCaller and four existing methods for NA12878,
NA12 891 and NA12 892 from the real datasets with read cover—
ages of 5, 10, 20 and 40x.

PedigreeCaller outperforms other four variant callers in
F—measure for all the read coverages. Also, PedigreeCaller
achieves the best performance on the number of TPs and recall
rate except for the dataset of 40x. Although Unif1ed Genotyper
produces better recall rate than that of PedigreeCaller in the 40x
data, the result of Uniﬁed Genotyper contains four times as many
FPs than PedigreeCaller, and hence its F—measure is worse than
that of PedigreeCaller. Although recall of SAMtools is low for all
the datasets, the results of SAMtools contain the least FPs for all
the datasets. In precision, SAMtools outperforms other variant
callers including PedigreeCaller except for the datasets with read
coverages of 5, 10, 20><, and gives the same performance as
PedigreeCaller for the dataset with read coverage of 40x. The
performance gaps between PedigreeCaller and other variant call—
ers are larger in lower coverage data, e. g. the maximum gap on
F—measure in the 40x data is 0.0025, whereas that in the 5x is
>0.1. Because read data is insufﬁcient for accurate variant calling
in low coverage data such as the 5 x data, the effects from pedigree
information and haplotyping are high, and the larger performance
gaps can be obtained in lower coverage data. This is also observed
in the results between TrioCaller and SAMtools. The results of
TrioCaller contain more TPs and less FPs than those of SAMtools
in the 5 and 10>< data, whereas SAMtools achieves better per—
formance in the numbers of TPs and FPs than TrioCaller in the
20x data.

Table 4 summarizes the performance of genotype concordance
on PedigreeCaller and four existing methods for NA12878,
NA12891 and NA12892: the numbers of TPs, FPs, true negatives
(TNs), FNs, accuracy, recall, precision and F—measure for the

Similar to the case of variant detection, PedigreeCaller outper—
forms these three variant callers in accuracy and F—measure on
genotype concordance for all the coverages. The performance gaps
between PedigreeCaller and other variant callers are larger in
lower coverage data, e. g. the maximum gaps on F—measure and
accuracy for the datasets of 40x are 0.002 and 0.001, respectively,
whereas gaps on F—measure and accuracy for the dataset of 5 x are
>01 and 0.05, respectively. Because read data is insufﬁcient for
accurate variant calling in low coverage data such as the 5x data,
the effects from pedigree information and haplotyping are high,
and the larger performance gaps can be obtained in lower cover—
age data. This is also observed in the results between TrioCaller
and SAMtools. The results of TrioCaller contain more TPs and
less FPs than those of SAMtools in the 5 and 10>< data, whereas
SAMtools achieves better performance in the numbers of TPs and
FPs than TrioCaller in the 20x data.

Figure 2 shows relationship between the physical distance of
variants and the performance gap of PedigreeCaller and other
existing variant callers in the 5x data. The x—axis indicates the

distance between positions in base pairs. The y—axis indicates the
F—measure difference given by the F—measure of PedigreeCaller
subtracted by that of other variant caller for the SNP positions
from which there exists a position with heterozygous genotype
call within a distance indicated by the x—axis. Here, we restrict the
position with heterozygous genotype call to the position where
at least two heterozygous genotypes are estimated by
PedigreeCaller among the trio members. As shown in Figure 2,
PedigreeCaller shows the strong performance for the SNP pos—
itions distant from other variants within 100 bp. Because the read
length in our data is 100 bp, this result implies that phase—inform—
ative reads effectively work for haplotyping and consequently
improve the performance of variant calling. Also, we can observe
a slow decline of the performance gap for the SNPs >100 bp
away from other variants. PedigreeCaller uses paired—end reads
for phase—informative reads as well, and less paired—end reads are
available as phase—informative reads for more distant positions.
Therefore, this slow decline of the performance gap is due to the
decrease of the haplotyping effect by paired—end reads.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We proposed a new statistical variant calling approach that con—
siders pedigree information and haplotyping based on phase—
informative reads. In a naive way, modeling of haplotyping
based on phase—informative reads may fail to estimate accurate
results owing to undesirable inﬂuence from homozygous positions
in the estimation of the assignment of each read to a haplotype. To
address this issue, we introduced latent variables that determine
zygosity, and avoided the undesirable inﬂuence from homozygous
positions by using the estimated zygosity in the latent variables.

Through variant calling in the practical NGS data and the com—
parison of the estimated variants with the SNP array genotyping
results, we showed that our approach outperforms existing variant
callers, including variant callers that consider pedigree informa—
tion. Also, the analysis of the performance on the positions located
close to other heterozygous variants showed that our approach is
more powerful in such positions than other variant callers, espe—
cially for SNPs distant from other variants within 100 bp. Because
read length in the data used for the evaluation is 100 bp, the result
of the analysis implies that haplotyping based on phase—inform—
ative reads with these variants effectively works for the improve—
ment of the performance in our approach. We also observed the
performance improvement by the effect of haplotyping based on
paired—end reads through the slow decline of the performance gap
between our approach and other variant callers on the SNP pos—
itions distant >100 bp from other variant positions.

Owing to the rapid progress of NGS technologies, read length
is extending in the current sequencing platforms. In addition,
systematically new technologies such as the Nanopore technol—
ogy (http://www.nanoporetech.com/) and the Moleculo technol—
ogy (http://www.moleculo.com/) are now under development,
and these technologies are considered to enable the production

of more accurate and longer sequencing data. Therefore, further
accurate variant calling is expected in our approach by using
longer reads available in the near future.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The completion of 168 genome sequences from a single
population of Drosophila melanogaster provides a global view of
genomic variation and an understanding of the evolutionary forces
shaping the patterns of DNA polymorphism and divergence along
the genome.

Results: We present the ‘Population Drosophila Browser’
(PopDrowser), a new genome browser specially designed for the
automatic analysis and representation of genetic variation across the
D. melanogaster genome sequence. PopDrowser allows estimating
and visualizing the values of a number of DNA polymorphism and
divergence summary statistics, linkage disequilibrium parameters
and several neutrality tests. PopDrowser also allows performing
custom analyses on-the-fly using user-selected parameters.

1 INTRODUCTION

Population genetics studies have been so far based on fragmentary
and non-random samples of genomes, providing a partial and
often biased View of the population genetics processes (Begun
et (11., 2007). A new dimension to genetic variation studies is
provided by the new availability of within-species genomes. Next-
generation sequencing technologies are making affordable genome-
wide population genetics data, not only for humans and the main
model organisms, but also for most organisms on which research is
actively carried out on genetics, ecology or evolution (Pool et (11.,
2010).

Genome browsers are very useful tools to query and visualize
disparate annotations at different genomic locations using a web
user interface (Schattner, 2008). A number of web-based genome
browsers displaying genetic variation data are already available
(Benson et (11., 2002; Dubchak and Ryaboy, 2006; Frazer et (11.,
2007; Hubbard et (11., 2002; Kent et (11., 2002; Stein et (11.,
2002). Such browsers, however, are not well suited to deal with
population genomics sequence information. For example, HapMap
(International HapMap Consortium, 2003), the most comprehensive

genome browser of variation data so far, contains information on
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), Copy Number Variations
(CNVs) and linkage disequilibrium of human populations. It does
not offer, however, genetic variation estimates along sliding-
windows or neutrality-based tests.

The Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) (T.Mackay
et (11., accepted for publication) has recently sequenced and analyzed
the patterns of genome variation in 168 inbred lines of Drosophila
melanogaster from a single population of Raleigh (USA), and
conducted a genome-wide association analysis of some phenotypic
traits. A major goal of this project is to create a resource of common
genetic polymorphism data to aid further population genomics
analyses. As a part of this DGRP project, here we present a modiﬁed
Gbrowse speciﬁcally designed for the automatic estimation and
representation of population genetic variation in D. melanogaster,
the ‘Population Drosophila Browser’ (PopDrowser). Unlike other
population analysis tools (Hutter et (11., 2006; Koﬂer et (11., 2011),
the PopDrowser is a genome browser, which can be customized to
create analogous resources for any other species with within-species
polymorphism data.

2 IMPLEMENTATION
2.1 Input data

The initial input data are a set of 168 aligned intraspeciﬁc
D. melanogaster sequences from the DGRP project, and also
include the genome sequences of Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila
simulans, which were used as outgroup species.

2.2 Interface and implementation

PopDrowser allows reporting precomputed estimates of several
DNA variation measures along each chromosome arm through
the combined implementation of the programs FDA 2 (Casillas
and Barbadilla, 2006), MKT (Egea et (11., 2008) and VariScan 2
(Hutter et (11., 2006). The data and summary statistics are graphically
displayed along the chromosome arms on a web-based user interface
using the Gbrowse software.

PopDrowser also includes an innovative capability that
allows performing custom analyses on-the-ﬂy. After selecting a
chromosome region and a particular track, the user can conduct
exhaustive analyses by deﬁning their own custom input parameters.
Furthermore, users can choose to either visualize the output of
their analyses graphically in the browser—as a new track—or to

on-the-ﬂy analyses are speciﬁed in Tablel.

The current implementation is running in an Ubuntu 10.04 Linux
x64 server, 2 IntelXeon 3Ghz processors, 32GB RAM with Apache.

2.3 Output

Along with reference genome annotations, the genome browser
output includes measures of a number of nucleotide summary
statistics, such as the levels of nucleotide diversity (7': and 6),
DNA divergence between species (K), different measures of linkage
disequilibrium and genome-wide neutrality tests. Such analyses are
computed along each chromosome arm in non-overlapping sliding
windows of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 10, 50 and 100kb. For each gene,
the browser also provides a single track including information
of the generalized and the integrative McDonald—Kreitman tests
(McDonald and Kreitman, 1991; T.Mackay et (11., accepted for
publication) along with minor and derived allele frequency (MAF,
DAF) spectrums (Fig. 1). All the tracks included in the PopDrowser
are summarized in Table 1.

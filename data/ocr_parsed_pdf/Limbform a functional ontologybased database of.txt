ABSTRACT

Summary: The ability of certain organisms to completely regenerate
lost limbs is a fascinating process, far from solved. Despite the extra-
ordinary published efforts during the past centuries of scientists per-
forming amputations, transplantations and molecular experiments, no
mechanistic model exists yet that can completely explain patterning
during the limb regeneration process. The lack of a centralized reposi-
tory to enable the efficient mining of this huge dataset is hindering the
discovery of comprehensive models of limb regeneration. Here, we
introduce Limbform (Limb formalization), a centralized database of
published limb regeneration experiments. In contrast to natural lan-
guage or text-based ontologies, Limbform is based on a functional
ontology using mathematical graphs to represent unambiguously
limb phenotypes and manipulation procedures. The centralized data-
base currently contains >800 published limb regeneration experiments
comprising many model organisms, including salamanders, frogs, in-
sects, crustaceans and arachnids. The database represents an extra-
ordinary resource for mining the existing knowledge of functional data
in this field; furthermore, its mathematical nature based on a functional
ontology will pave the way for artiﬁcial intelligence tools applied to the
discovery of the sought-after comprehensive limb regeneration
models.

available at http://limbform.daniel-lobo.com.

1 INTRODUCTION

Most phyla include species with the remarkable ability to regen-
erate lost body sections, the regeneration of limb appendages
being one of the most complex and fascinating processes
(Brockes and Kumar, 2008). Hundreds of experiments based
on physical manipulations and molecular disturbances have
identiﬁed many key genetic elements necessary for limb regener-
ation; however, no model exists yet that can explain the sufﬁcient
mechanisms that enable salamanders and other organisms to
carry out the perfect regeneration of amputated limbs (Nacu
and Tanaka, 2011). Understanding the process of regeneration
of complex 3D shape from cell growth is a problem of funda-
mental importance in biology, and this goal should not get lost in
the search for the minute details of genetic and molecular

interactions if we ever hope to ﬁnd comprehensive testable
models required to implement the sought-after promising bio-
medical applications (Lobo et al., 2014b).

The lack of formalization tools to describe functional experi-
ments and a centralized repository to store and analyze the vast
experimental literature of limb regeneration are hindering our
ability to find a comprehensive model of limb regeneration.
Papers are written in natural language, which is ambiguous
and difﬁcult to systematically mine and analyze, whereas pro-
posed text-based phenotypic ontologies (Robinson and Webber,
2014) are not ideal for describing qualitative (upper-arm versus
forearm), quantitative (number of ﬁngers), topological (ectopic
hand in forearm) and geometrical (segment length) information
key in regenerative experiments.

In contrast, novel functional mathematical ontologies based
on graphs have been recently proposed for the formalization of
morphologies and manipulations for planarian worm (Lobo
et al., 2013b) and limb (Lobo et al., 2014a) regenerative experi-
ments. In contrast to natural language, a mathematical graph
can unambiguously specify morphological data (Lobo et al.,
2011). A graph can represent both complete jointless organisms
such as planaria (where regions are represented by graph nodes
connected by graph edges) and joint-based structures such as
limbs (where segments connected by joints are represented by
graph edges connected by graph nodes).

Here, we present a database based on a functional ontology
system that unambiguously centralize the knowledge of limb re-
generation experiments in a diverse set of model organisms,
enabling the unambiguous description, centralize storage and
manual and automated mining of this vast dataset.

2 METHODS

2.1 Functional graph-based ontology for limb
morphologies and manipulations

To unambiguously describe the main characteristics of a limb morph-
ology in the database, we used a novel functional ontology for limb re-
generation experiments (Lobo et al., 2014a). A mathematical graph
represents the topological structure of a limb, where nodes specify limb
segments and links specify the connection between them. Labels in the
graph deﬁne the segment type and its geometrical characteristics, includ-
ing connection angles and overall size and shape. Manipulations are
deﬁned in the ontology with a tree-like mathematical graph: external
nodes (leaves of the tree) describe starting limb morphologies, and in-
ternal nodes describe elemental actions performed to the limb (remove,

crop, join, relocate, reverse or irradiate). Links deﬁne the interrelation
between actions.

2.2 Database implementation and curation

The Limbform database is implemented with the database engine SQLite
(public domain). A single ﬁle stores both the database schema and the
data, facilitating the administration and sharing of databases. The cen-
tralized database was manually curated using a freely available speciﬁc
software tool (Lobo et al., 2014a), which uses interactive graph represen-
tations and automatically generated cartoon diagrams as an optimal user-
interface for regeneration experiments (Lobo et al., 2013a).

3 RESULTS

We created the Limbform database of limb regeneration experi-
ments based on a functional ontology of mathematical graphs.
The database currently contains published regeneration experi-
ments performed on the main model organisms in limb regener-
ation, including salamanders, frogs, insects, crustaceans and
arachnids. An experiment in the database links a manipulation
procedure (any combination of cuts, amputations, reversals,
grafts and irradiations) to the resultant limb morphologies at
speciﬁc regeneration times. In this way, the database can
record morphologies with partial penetrance, as well as temporal
events during the regeneration process. In addition, an experi-
ment also includes information about the publication details
(including a Web link to the original publication), the species
used and the pharmacological and genetic treatments adminis-
tered and their timing during the experiment.

Currently, the centralize database contains 829 experiments
manually curated from 90 selected publications spanning from
the 1950s to the present day. The selected experiments cover a
wide range of surgical manipulations and treatments and a great
variety of resultant morphologies.

Figure 1 shows screenshots of the database, accessed with the
speciﬁc software application. The database is logically divided into
experiments, manipulations, morphologies, treatments, species
and publications (Fig. 1A). The details of an experiment include
its name, publication, species, pharmacological and genetic treat-
ments, the manipulation performed and the resultant morpholo-
gies obtained at speciﬁc times after amputation (Fig. 1B). Limb
morphologies contain segments speciﬁc to the species used, their
topological connectivity and their general shapes (Fig. 1C).
Complex manipulations are made of a combination of nested
elemental actions, such as crops and joins (Fig. 1D).

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Limbform is the ﬁrst repository centralizing the main experi-
ments of limb regeneration in multiple model organisms. We
curated hundreds of limb regeneration experiments, resultant
morphologies and manipulations from the published literature
into a centralized database. We have followed a careful curation
methodology to assure the consistency of the data; however, we
encourage the publications’ authors to verify the accuracy of the
curated experiments and report through our dedicated Web site
any possible inaccuracy in the data. We are continuously pub-
lishing revised versions of the database, with new and corrected
data, and will incorporate user revisions as they are submitted.

The rapid accumulation of regeneration experiments and the
difﬁculty of human scientists to glean algorithmic (constructive)
models of pattern formation (not merely genetic pathways) ne-
cessitate the use of computational approaches. The Limbform
database, owing to the mathematical and functional nature of
its ontology, will pave the way for the application of computa-
tional automated tools based on artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms
that will assist in the discovery of comprehensive models of
regeneration.

The Limbform database of limb regeneration experiment rep-
resents an invaluable resource for the community and establishes
the ﬁrst necessary steps of a new bioinformatics of shape. This in
turn will assist in the discovery and development of innovative
biological models driving transformative applications in regen-
erative biomedicine.

Abstract

Motivation: On the semantic web, in life sciences in particular, data is often distributed via multiple
resources. Each ofthese sources is likely to use their own International Resource Identifier for con—
ceptually the same resource or database record. The lack of correspondence between identifiers
introduces a barrier when executing federated SPAROL queries across life science data.

Results: We introduce a novel SPAROL—based service to enable on—the—fly integration of life science
data. This service uses the identifier patterns defined in the Identifiers.org Registry to generate a
plurality of identifier variants, which can then be used to match source identifiers with target identi—
fiers. We demonstrate the utility ofthis identifier integration approach by answering queries across
major producers of life science Linked Data.

Availability and implementation: The SPAROL—based identifier conversion service is available
without restriction at http://identifiers.org/services/sparql.

1 Introduction

Semantic Web technologies such as the Resource Description
Framework (RDF; http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf—primer/) and SPARQL
(http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/) offer a powerful paradigm
for publishing and exploring life science data through standardization
of format and data access. For example, the open source BioZRDF
(Callahan et (11., 2013) project converts dozens of public biological
databases and datasets from legacy formats into RDF, and provides a
mechanism to explore these as Linked Data. Recently, established bio-
informatic organizations such as DBCLS (http://togows.dbcls.jp/),

NCBI (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rdf/), neXtProt (Chichester
et (11., 2014) and the EMBL-EBI in collaboration with the UniProt
consortium (Jupp et (11., 2014) have made some datasets available in
RDF, thereby significantly extending the network of the Linked Open
Data.

All efforts use HTTP-based International Resource Identifiers
(IRIs) to identify and link data items. This facilitates querying across
network-linked resources, but the lack of a universal identifier sys-
tem requires mappings across all the different identifiers in use.
Identifiers.org (Juty et (11., 2012) provides resolvable persistent IRIs

used to identify individual records (based on the existing entity iden—
tifiers assigned directly by the data providers). Although some linked
data providers such as Bi02RDF and the EBI now make their
data available with identifiers.0rg URIs (or mappings to them), this
practice is not widely implemented. Therefore, the identifier mis—
match makes it difficult to query multiple datasets simultaneously.
String manipulation, supported by SPARQL, may be used for this
purpose but requires users to know in advance the IRI types being
used in each resource, making it a cumbersome and inefficient
solution.

To address the issue of identifier heterogeneity, we have de—
veloped a SPARQL—based service that generates on—the—fly identifier
mappings for registered IRI patterns. Here, we describe our novel
method and demonstrate its functionality through service—enabled
federated SPARQL queries. This system offers an automatic way to
link and query over a rapidly growing number of semantic web
friendly life science datasets.

2 Methods

We implemented a SPARQL—based service that generates a set of
variant identifiers based on a provided identifier. This service, imple—
mented using the OpenRDF Sesame SPARQL engine (http://www.
openrdf.0rg/), translates an incoming query pattern of the form
<subjectIRI>owl : sameAs ?targetIRI and generates a set of triples
with the specific subject, predicate, and the generated target IRI.
The service queries the curated Identifiers.org Registry to determine
the originating data collection, then obtains alternative IRIS pat—
terns, and finally generates and returns alternative IRIS.

3 Results

The Identifiers.org Registry contains 531 data collections and over
1300 IRI patterns. The service can be used to find alternative but
equivalent IRIs, or check whether two IRIS identify the same con—
cept. For supported data collections, this service eliminates the need
to know the set of valid IRI patterns in advance and the need to de—
vise elaborate string manipulation operations in a federated
SPARQL query.

The query example below illustrates how the service can be used
to query across datasets with different IRI schemes. In this example,
we run a federated query to find human proteins from UniProt and
their domains from InterPro Bio2RDF that are used in a model’s
components (of type SBML species) from BioModels Linked
Dataset (Wimalaratne et al., 2014). This query can be executed
using BioModels SPARQL endpoint (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/rdf/ser—
vices/biomodels/sparql) and takes around 20 s. The service bridges
the gap between the Identifiers.0rg—specified, Bio2RDF—specified
and UniProt—specified identifiers. Further examples are readily avail—
able at http://identifiers.org/documentation.

4 Discussion

Leveraging the wealth of biomedical big data for discovery requires
simple and effective approaches to tame the challenge of working
with heterogeneous, overlapping and diverse data. Of particular
concern is assignment of different identifiers for identical resources
as well as for conceptually identical resources. Identifier integration
is the subject of much research that focuses either on integrating
conceptually identical objects or their relations (van Iersel et al.,
2010; Wein et al., 2012; Chambers et al., 2013). In contrast, our
work focuses on the problem of having multiple identifiers for the
same database object, which is an emerging issue among semantic
web data providers. Our solution is rapid, scalable, and will grow to
provide new identifier—based mappings as additional IRI patterns
are added to the Identifiers.org Registry.

5 Conclusion

This IRI conversion service, provided by Identifiers.org as a
SPARQL service, will enable users to focus on asking meaningful
questions across biological datasets of interest rather than figuring
out how to generate the right identifiers.

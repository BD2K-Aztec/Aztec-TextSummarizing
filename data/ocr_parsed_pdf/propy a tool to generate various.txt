“The number depends on the choice of the number of properties of amino acid and the choice of the parameter values in algorithms.

(PseAAC): type I PseAAC with 50 descriptor values and type II
PseAAC (i.e. amphiphilic PseAAC) with 50 descriptor values.
Apart from these descriptors, it can also compute previous de—
scriptors based on user—defined properties, which are easily ac—
cessible from the AAindex database (Kawashima and Kanehisa,
2000). In fact, the aforementioned features can be regarded as
different Chou’s PseAAC modes. For example, amino acid, di—
peptide, tripeptide or n—mer peptide (11:4, 5,...) compositions
are just different modes of Chou’s PseAAC. Moreover, the
higher—level features, such as GO (Gene Ontology) information,
FunD (Functional Domain) information and sequential evolu—
tion information, are also skilfully fused into the Chou’s
PseAAC descriptors to characterize different protein informa—
tion, which is widely used for solving various biological prob—
lems. An excellent review by Chou (2011) has pointed out their
relevancy.

The propy package contains several functions and modules
manipulating proteins and peptides. To obtain protein sequences
easily, propy provides a download module, by which the user
could easily get protein sequences from the Uniprot website by
providing Uniprot IDs or a ﬁle containing Uniprot IDs. A check
module is also provided to ensure that our input for subsequent
calculation is reliable. To facilitate the accessibility of the prop—
erty or distance matrix of amino acids, propy provides an
AAIndex module, which helps the user automatically download
the needed property from the AAindex database. There are two
means to compute these structural and physicochemical features
from protein or peptide sequences. One is to use the built—in
modules in the propy package. There exist five modules respond—
ing to the calculation of descriptors from five feature groups. The
instruction for each module is provided in the form of HTML in
propy. We could import related functions to compute these fea—
tures as needed. The other is to call the GetProDes class by
importing the PyPro module, which encapsulates commonly
used descriptor calculation methods. We could construct a
GetProDes object with a protein sequence input, and then call
corresponding methods to calculate these features. A user guide
for the use of propy is included in propy to guide how the user
uses it to calculate the needed features (Supplementary Material).

Additionally, the main advantage of propy is that the users them—
selves could specify some sets of amino acid properties in the
form of dictionary (a data structure in python). More conveni—
ently, the output from the AAIndex module could be directly
used as the user—defined property to calculate the aforementioned
descriptors, greatly enlarging the applications to our calculated
features.

propy is written by the pure python language. We chose to use
python because it is open source, and there already exist pack—
ages to handle proteins [e.g. Biopython (Cock et al., 2009),
PyMol and Pythonscape]. It is convenient for propy to analyse
proteins and peptides processed by Biopython. Moreover, it only
needs the support of some built—in modules in python. This
greatly facilitates the transplantation and applications of the
propy package. The use of the dictionary data structure in
the propy output makes the users clearly understand the meaning
of each feature.

3 DISCUSSION

Sequence analysis of proteins and peptides has become more and
more important in various bioinformatics ﬁelds. Apart from
the prediction of structural and functional classes of proteins
or peptides, there exist a few stand—alone applications to calcu—
late protein/peptide descriptors, which are designed to work with
drug descriptors in the chemogenomics framework.

propy contains a selection of various Chou’s PseAAC descrip—
tors to analyse, classify and compare complex proteins and pep—
tides. They facilitate to exploit machine—learning techniques
to drive hypothesis from complex protein or peptide datasets.
The usefulness of the features covered by propy for computing
the structural and physicochemical features of proteins and pep—
tides has been validated by a number of published studies (Chou,
2009, 2011). The propy implementation of each of these algo—
rithms was extensively tested by using a number of test se—
quences. The computed descriptor values were compared with
the known values for these sequences to ensure that our compu—
tation is accurate.

propy is a powerful open source package for the extraction of
features of proteins and peptides. In our future work, we plan to

apply the integrated features on various biological research ques—
tions and extend the range of functions with new promising de—
scriptors for the coming versions of propy.

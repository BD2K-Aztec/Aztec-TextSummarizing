Abstract

Summary: Identification of driver mutations in human diseases is often limited by cohort size and
availability of appropriate statistical models. We propose a method for the systematic discovery of
genetic alterations that are causal determinants of disease, by prioritizing genes upstream of func—
tional disease drivers, within regulatory networks inferred de novo from experimental data. Here
we present the implementation of Driver—gene Inference by GeneticaI—Genomic Information Theory

as an R—system package.

Availability and implementation: The diggit package is freely available under the GPL—2 license

from Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org).

1 Introduction

Identification of somatic mutations and germline variants associated
to cancer and other complex diseases (driver mutations) is mostly
performed on a statistical basis (Lawrence et (11., 2013). Achieving
appropriate statistical power, however, requires large effect sizes or
large cohorts to control for errors arising from the large number of
tested hypothesis (Califano et (11., 2012). In addition, since statistical
approaches do not provide mechanistic insight, many disease risk
determinants, such as apolipoprotein E, were discovered long before
they were mechanistically elucidated (Liu et (11., 2013).

We have recently developed an approach that boosts the statis—
tical power of GWAS by focusing the analysis to genes mechanistic—
ally linked to a specific phenotype or cell state, termed master
regulators (MR, Aytes et (11., 2014, Carro et (11., 2010, Lefebvre et
(11., 2010). Driver—gene Inference by Genetical—Genomic Information
Theory (DIGGIT) searches for genetic alterations associated with
dysregulation of MR protein activity, reducing the number of
hypothesis to test, while providing regulatory clues to help elucidate
associated biological mechanisms (Chen et (11., 2014). We have
recently used DIGGIT to identify causal genetic determinants of the
mesenchymal subtype of human glioblastoma (GBM, Chen et (11.,
2014). Here, we present the R—system implementation of DIGGIT,
which is available as a software package from Bioconductor.

2 Approach

DIGGIT evaluates candidate alterations within a set of functional
disease drivers and their upstream regulators (Chen et (11., 2014).
This is accomplished by a five—step process, requiring gene expres—
sion, matched genetic—variant profiles, specifically copy number
variation data (CNV), and context—specific transcriptional (Basso et
(11., 2005) and post—translational (Wang et (11., 2009) regulatory
models.

The first step reduces the number of candidate genetic alter—
ations, by selecting those whose ploidy is informative of gene expres—
sion as candidate functional CNVs (F—CNVs). This is assessed based
on mutual information (MI) between copy number and expression.
During the second step, the MRs for a specific phenotypic transition
are inferred. The third step reduces the list of candidate genetic alter—
ations by considering only the loci coding for MR5 and their
upstream post—translational modulators, as inferred by the MINDy
algorithm. During the forth step, the statistical association between
the functional genetic alterations, steps 2 and 3, and the activity of
the MRS is inferred by MI analysis (activity Quantitative Trait Loci,
aQTL). Finally, a conditional association analysis is performed to
determine which, among multiple genes affected by the same ampli—
fied or deleted regions, are the most probable drivers of MR
dysregulation.

3 Implementation

DIGGIT is implemented as an R—system package and it is available
from Bioconductor. Input data and results are encapsulated in an S4
object of class diggit, requiring an expression dataset, CNV data,
and an appropriate tissue lineage—matched regulatory network (inter—
actome). Two alternative methods were implemented to compute the
F—CNVs: MI and correlation analysis (Fig. 1A). MI is estimated using
1— and 2—dimensional Gaussian kernels with optimal bandwidth selec—
tion though a plug—in (hpi) approach, as implemented in the ks pack—
age (available from CRAN: http://cran.r—project.org). Finally, the
statistical significance for the association is estimated by permutation
analysis.

MR analysis is then performed with the msviper function
implemented in the viper package (Bioconductor). Before aQTL
analysis, the relative activity of the MRs for each individual sample
is computed with the viper algorithm (viper package,
Bioconductor). This step is critical, because MRs are usually dysre—
gulated at the protein level, while rarely differentially expressed
(Aytes et (11., 2014; Carro et (11., 2010; Lefebvre et (11., 2010).
Activity quantitative trail loci are then inferred by computing the
statistical association between F—CNV and VIPER—inferred MR
protein activity by MI or correlation analysis.

Finally, the conditional association analysis is performed by
estimating the statistical association between samples harboring
F—CNVs in a gene ‘a’ and the phenotype groups, after conditioning
for the presence of CNVs in other genes ‘g’, one at a time, by
Fisher’s exact test. Results for this analysis can be displayed as heat—
maps (Fig. 1B). Selection of candidate genes for experimental valid—
ation and biochemical characterization can be performed based on
the aQTL analysis p—values, either before or after correction by
conditional association analysis.

4 Example application

We analyze 230 expression and CNV profiles for human GBM
(The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA), distributed in the diggitdata
package (Bioconductor), which also includes GBM—specific
transcriptional and post—translational regulatory networks (Chen et
(11., 2014).

For the sake of speed, we restrict the analysis here to the
first 1000 genes in the CNV profile, and infer the F—CNVs as
follows:

> genes <— intersect (rownames (gmexprs) ,

+ rownames (gmeNV)) [1:1000]

> gmeNV <— gmeNV [match (genes , rownames (gmeNV) ) , ]

> dobj <— fCNV(dobj , method:”mi”)

A scatterplot showing the association between CNV and expres—
sion for KLHL9 is shown in Figure 1A. Master regulators between
the mesenchymal and proneural GBM subtypes can be inferred, and
the top 20 most activated MRs displayed, with:

> dobj <— marina (dobj , phenoz”subtype” , grouplz”MEs” ,

> sort (diggitMR (dobj) , decreasinngRUE) [1:20]

Then, aQTL analysis for two previously validated MRs (Carro
et (11., 2010), following by conditional association analysis for
STAT3, can be performed as follows:

> set . seed(l)

> dobj <— aqtl (dobj , mr:c (”CEBPU’, ”STAT3”) , method:”mi”)
> dobj <— conditional (dobj , phenoz” subtype”, grouplz”MES”,
+ group2:”PN”, mr:”STAT3”, cnv:.15)

Conditional analysis results can be displayed as heatmap
(Fig. 1B):

> plot (dobj , clusterz”2”)

Finally, results can be limited to MINDy—inferred post—translational
modulators of the considered MR5, and summarized by:

> set . seed(l)

> dobj <— aqtl (dobj , mr:c (”CEBPU’, ”STAT3”) , method:”mi” ,

5 Discussion

Elucidating the causal genetic determinants of most complex dis—
eases has proven more challenging than expected. Due to the large
number of candidate loci, it is difficult to achieve enough statistical
power to detect all but the most highly penetrant and frequent
events. Furthermore, classic GWAS approaches are based on pure
statistical associations, providing no mechanistic insights. DIGGIT
aims to address both challenges by relying on context—specific mod—
els of cell regulation. It boosts the statistical power by focusing on
the regulators mechanistically linked to the phenotype and on their
upstream post—translational modulators (Chen et (11., 2014). The
algorithm relies on large (n > 100 samples) expression and genetic
profiles and requires cell context—specific models of transcriptional
and post—transcriptional regulation. Its R implementation, available
as an R—system package from Bioconductor, has low computational

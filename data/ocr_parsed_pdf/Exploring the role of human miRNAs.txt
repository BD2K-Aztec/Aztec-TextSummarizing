ABSTRACT

Motivation: Human miRNAs have recently been found to have import-
ant roles in viral replication. Understanding the patterns and details of
human miRNA interactions during virus—host interactions may help
uncover novel antiviral therapies. Based on the abundance of know-
ledge available regarding protein—protein interactions (PPI), virus—host
protein interactions, experimentally validated human miRNA-target
pairs and transcriptional regulation of human miRNAs, it is possible
to explore the complex regulatory network that exists between viral
proteins and human miRNAs at the system level.

Results: By integrating current data regarding the virus—human inter-
actome and human miRNA-target pairs, the overlap between targets
of viral proteins and human miRNAs was identified and found to rep-
resent topologically important proteins (e.g. hubs or bottlenecks) at the
global center of the human PPl network. Viral proteins and human
miRNAs were also found to significantly target human PPl pairs.
Furthermore, an overlap analysis of virus targets and transcription fac-
tors (T Fs) of human miRNAs revealed that viral proteins preferentially
target human miRNA TFs, representing a new pattern of virus—host
interactions. Potential feedback loops formed by viruses, human
miRNAs and miRNA TFs were also identified, and these may be ex-
ploited by viruses resulting in greater virulence and more effective
replication strategies.

1 INTRODUCTION

miRNAs are key regulators of various biological processes
(Bushati and Cohen, 2007). In addition, recent studies have
demonstrated that human miRNAs also have diverse roles in
mediating Virusihuman interactions, see survey by Ghosh et a]
(2009). For example, Viruses are able to regulate infection-asso-
ciated host factors by manipulating human miRNAs to facilitate
the infection process (Wang et al., 2008). miRNAs can also inter-
fere with the Virus infection process (Santhakumar et al., 2010).
By exploring the role of human miRNAs in Viral pathogenesis,
our understanding of the complex Virusihuman interactions will
be further increased.

Viruses may selectively take advantage of human miRNAs to
increase their ability to infect or replicate within hosts. For ex-
ample, Wang et al. found that cytomegalovirus induced changes
in miRNA expression (Wang et al., 2008). Ho et al. also found
that enterovirus-induced miR-l4l targeted cap-dependent trans-
lation initiation factor (eIF4E) resulting in termination of host
protein synthesis (Ho et al., 2011). Conversely, human miRNAs
can also interfere with Viral infections. For example,
Santhakumar et al. found that a subset of human miRNAs regu-
lated signal transduction pathways, including PI3K/AKT and
ERK/MAPK signaling pathways, as well as oxidative stress sig-
naling and prostaglandin synthesis. Moreover, these miRNAs
were able to confer broad inhibitory potential against multiple
Viruses (Santhakumar et al., 2010). In addition, Lagos et a]. fur-
ther confirmed that human miRNAs can regulate innate immune
response to Viral infections (Lagos et al., 2010).

Human miRNAs can also directly target Viral genomes. For
example, Lecellier et a]. conﬁrmed that the open reading frame
of human foamy Virus was targeted by human miR-32, resulting
in effective inhibition of human foamy Virus replication (Lecellier
et al., 2005). Similarly, overexpression of human miR-l99a in-
hibited replication of the hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genome in cells
infected with HCV-lb or HCV-2a replicons (Murakami et al.,
2009). However, it remains unclear whether human miRNAs
that directly target Viruses confer resistance to Viral infections,
or if they are used by Viruses to establish infection.

The growing availability of experimental data regarding the
human protein interactome, Virusihost protein interactions and
human miRNA-target pairs has provided a valuable opportunity
to study the role of human miRNAs at the systems level.
Therefore, in this study, a potential regulatory network was gen-
erated using host targets of Viral proteins, human miRNAs and
putative miRNA TFs. Speciﬁcally, four typical patterns of
human miRNA-mediated Virusihuman interactions (Fig. l),
the topological characteristics of host target proteins and
human miRNA targets described in the human proteiniprotein
interaction network (PPIN) are included.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Human protein interaction dataset

The Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) (Release 9) (Keshava
Prasad et al., 2009) that overlaps well with other PPI databases was used
in this study. The largest connected component with 9270 nodes and
38 855 interactions was obtained by removing small clusters and single
nodes. All topological parameters were computed using the largest
connected component.

2.2 Virus—human interactome dataset

A virusihuman protein interaction dataset that included 150 viruses and
3300 interactions was obtained from the VirHostNet database (Navratil
et al., 2009). This database collects high quality, up-to-date information
curated from public databases.

2.3 Experimentally validated targets and potential human
miRNA TFs

By integrating four miRNA target databases, Tarbase (Sethupathy et al.,
2006), miR2disease (Jiang et al., 2009), miReoords (Xiao et al., 2009) and
miRtarbase (Hsu et al., 2008), an experimentally validated human
miRNA target dataset was constructed. This dataset included 3923
miRNA-target pairs. Available information regarding TFs of human
miRNAs was downloaded from the PuTmiRdatabase (Bandyopadhyay
and Bhattacharyya, 2010).

2.4 Topological analysis of a protein interaction network

The network analyzer plugin for Cytoscape (Assenov et al., 2008) was
used to compute the degree and betweenness centrality of proteins in the
PPIN. Human proteins in the top 5% of degree and betweenness cen-
trality in the human protein network were deﬁned as hubs and bottle-
necks, respectively. K-oore and excess retention (ER) analyses were also
used to measure the distance of the node list from certain properties
related to the network center. The k-oore of a network is deﬁned as the
maximum sub-network obtained by pruning all nodes with a degree lower
than k. The ER value, Eﬁ/ EA, is deﬁned as the ratio of the proportion of
nodes with property A in the k-oore, Eﬁ, to the proportion of nodes with
property A in the original network, EA.

2.5 Randomization test

To test whether viral proteins and human miRNAs preferentially interact
with protein pairs in the human PPIN, human PPIs obtained from the
HPRD database (including 39 204 pairs of interactions) were used. First,
the actual number of interaction pairs that were targeted by viral proteins
and human miRNAs was computed, and then all interaction pairs were
shufﬂed 10 000 times while preserving the interaction number. Each time
the number of interaction pairs targeted by viral proteins and human
miRNAs was computed (represented as X), the P-value was deﬁned as
the ratio of the number of X larger than the actual number to 10000.

To examine the preference for hubs and bottlenecks of the overlapping
targets between virus and human miRNAs, the actual proportion of hubs
and bottlenecks of the overlapping targets was computed (represented as
Y). The same number of nodes (as hubs or bottlenecks) was then sampled
from HPRD, and this was repeated 10 000 times. The P-value was
deﬁned as the ratio of the number of random hubs or bottlenecks
proportions that are larger than Y to 10000.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Overlapping target proteins and protein pairs between
viral proteins and human miRNAs

Viruses may benefit by directly interacting with human proteins
targeted by human miRNA (Fig. 1a); for example, miR-17-5p
and miR-20a can repress the transcriptional coactivator of Tat
during HIV infection (Triboulet et al., 2007). To explore the
direct relationship between Viral proteins and human miRNAs,
the overlap between host targets recognized by Viral proteins and
human miRNA targets was examined. Approximately 30% of
the host targets recognized by Viruses represent human miRNAs
(P< 0.0001, Fisher’s exact test). Contingency tables are shown in

A human miRNA was associated with a viral protein if its target inter-
acted with viral proteins. The CYS formatted Cytoscape ﬁle of the
human miRNA and viral protein association network and the interaction
list are available in more detail in the Supplementary Files

Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. The overlap is further
described in Figure 2a, including representation of a network
based on the systematic associations identiﬁed between Viral pro-
teins and human miRNAs (Fig. 2b).

It has previously been demonstrated that human miRNAs and
Viral proteins tend to interact with hubs and bottlenecks in
human PPIN. To eliminate the inﬂuence of the degree and
betweenness centrality of their overlap, we preserved the distri-
bution of these variables, respectively, and re-examined their
overlap. Results indicated that Viruses may provide distinct con-
tributions to the signiﬁcant overlap (Supplementary Files).

Two interacted proteins can be targeted by a Viral protein and
a human miRNA, respectively (Fig. 1b), and therefore the
miRNA may be involved into the Virus infection process. For
example, PI3 kinase and its activator ESRl form an interacted
protein pair. The PI3 kinase was revealed to be targeted by HCV
NS5A protein, and can be activated during HCV infection
(Street et al., 2005). On the other hand, ESRl was found to be
a target of miR-18b Woshimoto et al., 2011). It can then be
speculated that overexpression of miRNA-18b may be unfavor-
able to HCV infection. In fact, miRNA-18b had been found to
be downregulated during HCV infection process (Liu et al.,
2010), which may contribute to the overexpression of PI3
kinase. Herein, their relationships were investigated in the
network View. On one hand, human protein interaction pairs
targeted by Viral proteins and human miRNAs were examined.

These results demonstrate that the ratios decreased as the network dis-

tance increased (P<0.0001, Spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient:

—0.949)

A total of 7456 interaction pairs were found to be targeted by
Viral proteins and human miRNAs, whereas 7086 interaction
pairs were targeted under random conditions. These results indi-
cated that human PPI pairs represent signiﬁcant targets of Viral
proteins and human miRNAs (P<0.0001). On the other hand,
all human protein pairs were divided into 14 groups based on
their network distances (the maximum distance of protein pairs
was 14). It was observed that the ratio of protein pairs targeted
by human miRNAs and Viral proteins significantly decreased as
the network distance increased (Fig. 3).

3.2 Topological features of the overlapping targets present
in the PPIN

To further understand the relationship between Viruses and
human miRNAs, we analyzed the topological characteristics of
the overlapping targets in the PPIN.

The proportion of hubs and bottlenecks in the overlapping
targets was 32.43 and 29.70%, respectively, which are signiﬁ-
cantly higher percentages than observed under random condi-
tions (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Compared with
non-overlapping targets, the overlapping targets also had a
greater degree and betweenness centrality (P<0.0001,
KolmogoroviSmirnov test). For example, the mean degrees of
overlapping and non-overlapping targets were 30.8065 and
7.4968, respectively, whereas the mean betweenness centralities
were 0.0020 and 0.0003, respectively. These results are consistent
with previous findings, demonstrating that human miRNAs
and Viral proteins tend to interact with hubs and bottlenecks
in the human PPIN (Dyer et al., 2008; Hsu et al., 2008).

Results from k-core and ER analyses further demonstrated
that the ER value increased as k increased (Fig. 4) indicating
that the overlapping targets were located in the global center
of the human PPIN. The ER value of Viral proteins and
human miRNA targets showed similar trends, but had lower
values at each step, indicating that the overlapping targets
occupy deeper layers in the human PPIN. An additional function
enrichment analysis (Thomas et al., 2003) was performed indi-
cating that the overlapping proteins were mainly involved in cel-
lular processes such as cell communication and transport
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

in the supplementary files

3.3 Transcription factors of human miRNAs are
preferentially targeted by viral proteins

Viral protein can regulate human TFs speciﬁc for human
miRNAs (Fig 1c). For example, the LMPl protein of Epsteini
Barr Virus can activate NF-KB, which was conﬁrmed to be a
transcription factor of miR-146a (Cameron et al., 2008). For a
better understanding of the relationships between Viral proteins
and human miRNAs, the significance of overlap between host
targets recognized by Viral proteins and human miRNA TFs was
examined. This analysis demonstrated that 32.26% of human
miRNA TFs were found to be targeted by Viral proteins, and
the overlap was signiﬁcant based on the 2 x 2 contingency tables
(P200006; Fisher’s exact test). The details are provided in
Supplementary Table S3. Contingency tables are provided in
Supplementary Tables S5 and S6. A Venn diagram of the overlap
is illustrated in Figure 5a, and an association network of Viral
proteins and human miRNAs was constructed based on human
miRNA regulators (Fig. 5b). Taken together, these results sug-
gested that Viruses potentially have the capacity to regulate
expression of human miRNAs.

Negative transcriptional coregulation of an miRNA and its
target is a recurring motif in mammals (Tsang et al., 2007).
For example, E2F and Myc, which are targets of miR-17-92,

Fig. 6. Two potential feedback loops formed by the targeting of host

also induce miR-17-92 transcription (Aguda et al., 2008). Based
on human miRNA TFs targeted by viral proteins, two potential
feedback loops were identiﬁed that included host targets of viral
proteins and human miRNAs (Fig. Id). We hypothesized that
these loops may be important in boosting the virusihost balance
(Fig. 6).

The ﬁrst potential feedback loop identiﬁed was related to
hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Fig. 6, left). XBPl is a protein that
participates in the IREl-XBPl pathway involved in mediating
the ER stress response or unfolded protein response. The HBVX
protein can mediate activation of the unfolded protein response
pathway that most likely promotes HBV replication and expres-
sion in liver cells (Li et al., 2007). Therefore, regulation of XBPl
by hsa-mir-127 may be used by HBV to ﬁneitune its expression.
The second feedback loop identified was related to HCV (Fig. 6,
right). It has been shown that PPARa activation plays a crucial
role in HCV core protein-induced hepatic steatosis and hepato-
cellular carcinoma in mice (Tanaka et al., 2008). Therefore,
PPARa inhibition by hsa—mir-519d may facilitate the regulation
of HCV disease progression.

4 DBCUSﬁON

The discovery that human miRNAs play crucial roles in viral
pathogenesis provides valuable insight into new patterns of
virusihost interactions. Based on the systematic overlap analysis
performed using data from virusihost protein interactions, pre-
viously identiﬁed human miRNA-target pairs and known human
miRNA TFs, it appears that human miRNAs have important
and wide ranging effects on virusihost interactions.

The existence of a large proportion of shared target proteins
and protein pairs between viral proteins and human miRNAs
indicates that human miRNA regulation subnetworks and viral
infections are significantly interwoven in host cell networks.
Correspondingly, analysis of topological characteristics asso-
ciated with the PPIN reveals that overlapping proteins were pref-
erentially topologically important (e. g. hubs and bottlenecks)
and tended to occupy the global center of the PPIN. It is possible
that the special position of the overlapping targets in the PPIN
facilitates the ability of viruses and human miRNAs to efﬁciently
take control of the PPIN. The functional analysis of overlapping
targets also demonstrates that these genes take part in basic cel-
lular processes, such as cell communication and apoptosis, which
also suggests that human miRNAs play key roles in the process
of virus infection and replication.

The signiﬁcant overlap between host targets for viruses and
possible human miRNA TFs also reveals a new pattern of virusi
host interactions. Therefore, targeting human miRNA TFs
may be an effective way for a virus to gain control of a host
cell, especially because miRNAs can regulate a large number of
host proteins. Interestingly, we also ﬁnd that the host targets of
viral proteins may form feedback loops with human miRNAs.
These negative feedback loops may be exploited by viruses to
fineitune their pathogenesis and to complete their replication
cycle. Therefore, interfering with these regulatory circuits may
provide new approaches for developing antiviral therapies.
Certainly, stronger experimental and computational evidence
will be needed to further define the existence and universality
of the described virusihost interaction patterns.

In this article, rules governing virusihost interactions were
systematically analyzed using a high-quality dataset. Because of
the complexity of virusihost interactions, all the possible virusi
host interaction patterns could not be explored and only several
typical virusihost interaction patterns involving the role
of human miRNAs were described, and there are reports of
the roles of host epigenetic regulators (Abraham and
Kulesza, 2012; White et al., 2010). There are many other patterns
involving virusihost interactions that need to be further investi-
gated. For example, human miRNAs can directly target
viral genomes for defense (Lecellier et al., 2005), and viral pro-
teins were also found to regulate expression of human miRNAs
that targeted host chromatin remodeling proteins (Rahman
et al., 2012).

Abstract

Motivation: The growing amount of regulatory data from the ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics
and other consortia provides a wealth of opportunities to investigate the functional impact of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Yet, given the large number of regulatory datasets, researchers
are posed with a challenge of how to efficiently utilize them to interpret the functional impact of
SNP sets.

Results: We developed the GenomeRunner web server to automate systematic statistical analysis
of SNP sets within a regulatory context. Besides defining the functional impact of SNP sets,
GenomeRunner implements novel regulatory similarity/differential analyses, and cell type—specific
regulatory enrichment analysis. Validated against literature— and disease ontology—based
approaches, analysis of 39 disease/trait—associated SNP sets demonstrated that the functional im—
pact of SNP sets corresponds to known disease relationships. We identified a group of autoim—
mune diseases with SNPs distinctly enriched in the enhancers ofT helper cell subpopulations, and
demonstrated relevant cell type—specificity of the functional impact of other SNP sets. In summary,
we show how systematic analysis of genomic data within a regulatory context can help interpret—
ing the functional impact of SNP sets.

1 IntrOducuon SNPs lie outside protein coding regions (Hindorff et (11., 2009;

The success of genome—Wide association studies (GWASS) in finding
causative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for Mendelian dis—
orders is hindered by their failure to define complex patterns of non—
Mendelian inheritance, such as seen in multi—factorial complex dis—
eases (Altmuller et (11., 2001). This is in part because ~88—93% of all

Maurano et (11., 2012), complicating our understanding of the regula—
tory mechanisms involved. Furthermore, ~90% of all SNPs are rare
(Nelson et (11., 2012), i.e. occurring in a small percentage of individ—
uals (typically 0.05—5%), and generally underemphasized in GWASS.
Thus, only a fraction of valuable genetic information is studied.

Recent research has provided evidence that rare SNPs and SNPs
outside of protein—coding regions can contribute to disease manifest—
ation (Battle et (11., 2014; Bodmer and Bonilla, 2008; Cheung and
Spielman, 2009; Corradin et (11., 2014; Morley et (11., 2004; Reddy
et (11., 2012) by collectively altering DNA methylation (Gertz et (11.,
2011), histone modifications (McDaniell et (11., 2010; Trynka et (11.,
2013), enhancers (Corradin et (11., 2014), chromatin states
(Kasowski et (11., 2013; Kilpinen et (11., 2013), deoxyribonuclease I
(DNAse I) accessibility (Degner et (11., 2012) and transcription factor
binding (Kasowski et (11., 2010; Maurano et (11., 2012, 2015; Reddy
et (11., 2012), leading to gene expression changes (Battle et (11., 2014;
Cheung and Spielman, 2009; Morley et (11., 2004; Stranger et (11.,
2007) (reviewed in Haraksingh and Snyder, 2013) and disruption of
protein—protein interactions (Mosca et (11., 2015). Yet exploring
SNPs—regulatory relationships in a hypothesis—driven manner is not
just time—consuming, but also limited to the regulatory mechanisms
an individual researcher can think of. Conversely, using systematic—
ally organized publicly available regulatory data offers a data—driven
investigation of potential functional mechanisms altered by SNPs.
To do this, software is needed to facilitate systematic analysis of
such genome—wide data.

Recent years have seen rapid growth of publicly available data
on genome organization and functional/regulatory information
(Adams et (11., 2012; Bernstein et (11., 2010; ENCODE Project
Consortium, 2004). The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements
(ENCODE) project, the Roadmap Epigenomics program and others
(Adams et (11., 2012; Bernstein et (11., 2010; ENCODE Project
Consortium, 2004) have been actively cataloguing functional/regu—
latory genome annotation datasets, such as cell— and tissue specific
histone modification profiles, DNAse I hypersensitive sites, chroma—
tin states, and transcription factor—binding sites (TFBSs). Although
many breakthroughs have been made by the analyses of these data—
sets, these resources remain underutilized by computational biolo—
gists for systematic analysis and interpretation of the functional
mechanisms associated with, and potentially altered by, experimen—
tally obtained ‘omics’ data.

In this article, we describe the GenomeRunner web server—an
automated framework for the statistical analysis and interpretation
of the functional impact of SNP sets using regulatory datasets from
the ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics and other projects.
GenomeRunner prioritizes regulatory datasets most significantly en—
riched in SNP sets and visualizes the most significant enrichments
(Fig. 1), thus suggesting regulatory mechanisms that may be altered
by them. In addition to prioritizing SNP set—specific regulatory en—
richments (functional impact), GenomeRunner implements three
novel approaches: (i) regulatory similarity analysis, aimed at iden—
tifying groups of SNP sets having similar functional impact; (ii) dif—
ferential regulatory analysis, developed to identify functional impact
specific for a group of SNP sets; and (iii) cell type regulatory enrich—
ment analysis, designed to identify cell type specificity of the func—
tional impact. We have reviewed 20—related software tools to
highlight the novel functionality of GenomeRunner (Fig. 1,
Supplementary Table S1).

The article is organized as follows. The Methods part provides a
brief overview of GenomeRunner functionality and analytical
approaches. The Results part illustrates the application of
GenomeRunner to deepen our understanding of the potential func—
tional impact of 39 disease/trait—associated SNP sets.
GenomeRunner identified a group of nine immunologic diseases
with distinct functional enrichment signature of the corresponding
SNP sets, detected cell specificity of the regulatory enrichments rele—
vant to disease pathology, and confirmed known enrichment of the

2 Methods

2.1 Data source and preprocessing

We used organism— and cell type—specific regulatory datasets from the
ENCODE (Rosenbloom et (11., 2013) and Roadmap Epigenomics
(Bernstein et (11., 2010) projects. The hg19/mm9 human/mouse gen—
ome annotation data from the ENCODE project were downloaded
from the UCSC genome database (Rosenbloom et (11., 2013) (http://
hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/encodeDCC/and http://hg
download.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm9/encodeDCC/, respectively).
The Roadmap Epigenomics hg19 human genome annotation data
was obtained from the http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/
index.html web portal (Roadmap Epigenomics et (11., 2015). The
FANTOM consortium (Carninci et (11., 2005) human cell type—specific
enhancer data was downloaded from http://enhancer.binf.ku.dk/pre
sets/. The Cistrome (Liu et (11., 2011) human/mouse regulatory data
were downloaded from http://cistrome.dfci.harvard.edu/NR_
Cistrome/index.html. All data were accessed on July 22, 2015.

To automate the use of the regulatory datasets, we convert the
data to 0—based BED format (http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/
FAQformat.html#format1.7). This conversion keeps genomic co—
ordinates and, if available, strand and score information of regions
annotated with regulatory or functional properties. We keep regula—
tory data across standard chromosome names, e.g. for human, 22
chromosomes, X and Y chromosomes and MT chromosome, if
available. To speed up data access, the BED files are compressed
and indexed by the bgzip/tabix tools (Li, 2011).

As regulatory regions can be strand—specific and/or differ in the
strength/significance of signal detection, we provide an option to

filter the regulatory datasets by strand and signal strength. To filter
the regulatory datasets by signal strength, we estimate the 25, 50
and 75% percentiles of the full signal range. These percentiles are
used as thresholds to filter out regulatory regions with signal
strength below the selected percentile threshold. This filtering strat—
egy allows focusing the analyses on regulatory regions with high sig—
nal strength.

A total of 20 877 regulatory datasets (GRCh37/hg19 genome as—
sembly) are organized in a hierarchical structure (Fig. 1A,
Supplementary Table S2). Each category of the regulatory datasets
can be selected, as well as the individual datasets. The structured
database organization simplifies interpretation of the results by
focusing the analysis on a particular category of the regulatory data—
sets, and further narrowing it to a cell type—specific level.

2.2 Disease— and trait—associated SNP sets

Genomic coordinates (hg19) of the 39 disease— and trait—associated
SNP sets were extracted from the Supplementary Table S1 of the
Farh et al. article ‘Genetic and epigenetic fine mapping of causal
autoimmune disease variants’ (Farh et (11., 2014).

2.3 Regulatory enrichment analysis
The regulatory enrichment analysis evaluates whether SNPs in a set
are statistically significantly co—localized with the regulatory regions
in a datasets. The enrichment of such co—localization is assessed
using the Chi—square (default) or Binomial tests, or Monte Carlo
simulations (Phipson and Smyth, 2010). We do not employ random
sampling from the whole genome, as the distribution of SNPs at any
given genomic region is not uniform (Ellegren et (11., 2003). Instead,
by default, we provide a ‘background’ of all or common (with a
minor allele frequency >1%) organism—specific SNPs from the latest
dbSNP database. The user has an option to provide a custom back—
ground, e.g. a set of all SNPs evaluated in a study. The ‘background’
set of SNPs is used to evaluate co—localizations that occur by chance.
Considering the fact that different types of regulatory regions are
not independent (e.g. DNAse I hypersensitive sites may co—localize
with H3K27ac activating histone modification mark), the regulatory
enrichment P—values are corrected for multiple testing using the false
discovery rate (FDR) procedure. We perform the correction on a
per—cell—type basis, as each cell type has its own dependencies among
different types of regulatory datasets. The enrichment analysis
allows mechanistic insight into the functional impact of SNPs by
prioritizing regulatory datasets most significantly enriched in user—
provided SNP sets.

2.4 Regulatory similarity analysis

In the era of precision medicine, or the tailoring of treatments to pa—
tient—specific genetics, classification of patients by comparing pa—
tient—specific mutation profiles (Hofree et (11., 2013; Tian et (11.,
2014; Wang et (11., 2014) is becoming an important clinical goal.
GenomeRunner’s regulatory similarity analysis allows classification
of multiple SNP sets by estimating similarity of their functional im—
pact by comparing their regulatory enrichment profiles.

We define a SNP set—specific regulatory enrichment profile as a
vector of enrichment Z scores obtained by testing a set of SNPs for
enrichment in several regulatory datasets (Supplementary Figure
S2). If sets of SNPs are co—localized with similar regulatory datasets
(i.e. have similar functional impact), their regulatory enrichment
profiles will be similar. On the other hand, if sets of SNPs are en—
riched in different regulatory datasets, their regulatory enrichment
profiles will be different. Note that SNPs in the sets do not have to

have exact genomic location, but instead may be co—enriched in the
same regulatory regions. As such, the regulatory similarity analysis
evaluates relationships among SNP sets using regulatory context as
a common reference.

The results of the regulatory similarity analysis are visualized as
an interactive heatmap of pairwise Spearman correlation coefficients
among the SNP set—specific regulatory enrichment profiles. The
heatmap is clustered to highlight groups of SNP sets with distinct
regulatory signatures. The user can adjust clustering parameters,
and define groups of SNP sets for the subsequent differential regula—
tory analysis.

2.5 Differential regulatory analysis

The differential regulatory analysis defines which regulatory signa—
tures are associated with each group of SNP sets. For each pair of
groups, the distributions of the enrichment Z—scores are compared
for statistically significant differences using the Wilcoxon test. This
comparison is performed for each regulatory dataset used for the en—
richment analysis, and an FDR—corrected vector of P—values is col—
lected. The differential regulatory analysis identifies regulatory
datasets significantly enriched in one group but not in the other.

2.6 Cell type regulatory enrichment analysis
The cell type specific bias of the functional enrichments of a SNP set
can be assessed with the cell type regulatory enrichment analysis.
This analysis identifies the cell type specificity of the regulatory
datasets most frequently and most significantly enriched in SNPs in
this set. For each cell type, the distribution of cell type—specific regu—
latory enrichment Z—scores is compared with the overall distribution
of the enrichment Z—scores using the Wilcoxon test.

The cell type regulatory enrichment analysis, by nature, requires
a SNP set to be tested in more than five cell type—specific regulatory
datasets. This is best achieved by selecting several categories of cell
type—specific regulatory datasets, e.g. DNAse— and histone modifica—
tion regulatory datasets from the Roadmap Epigenomics project.

2.7 Literature similarity and disease ontology analyses

To establish similarity between two disease terms, the literature—
based approach uses information from public databases, such as dis—
ease—phenotype data from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man,
disease—associated genes (Entrez Gene), chemical compounds
(CHEMID), pharmaceuticals (FDA drug list), and Gene Ontology
(GO) terms. Let A and C represent the two diseases being compared
and 3,, represents the set of 7; relationships they share. The first lit—
erature—based similarity metric is the number of shared relationships
between A and C, normalized to the highest number of shared rela—
tionships A and C share with any other disease besides themselves
(sharedRels). The second metric represents the number of A—C
shared relationships weighted by the number of expected relation—
ships based on the connectivity of each entity (Bu) in the shared net—
work (obsExp). Third is the minimum mutual information between
A—Bn and Bn—C terms (minMim). Fourth metric is the strength of
the literature connections between them (0.8 for every sentence co—
mention, 0.5 for every abstract) (directStr). Fifth is the relative over—
lap between A and C in terms of the number of shared relationships
(relOverlap). And finally, the minimum implicit strength normalized
(misn), which ranks each A—Bn and Bn—C relationship as a function
of the total area under the curve for all their relationships and calcu—
lates the minimum overlap they share. This misn method will weight
highly correlated diseases whose overlapping relationships tend to
be comparable in strength (e.g. if ‘cell growth’ is an important

concept in both A and C literatures, then it will raise their misn. If it
is very important to one but minimally important to the other, then
it will not contribute much to the score).

The disease ontology (DO)—based similarity method uses ‘Wang’,
‘Resnik’, ‘Rel’, ‘Jiang’ and ‘Lin’ metrics, implemented in the DOSim
R package (Li et (11., 2011, and references therein).

2.8 Performance optimization and assessment
GenomeRunner performs a large number of statistical calculations
to obtain regulatory enrichments. We optimized statistical calcula—
tions by precalculating overlaps between each default ‘background’
SNP set and each regulatory dataset. These precalculated values rep—
resent overlaps that can occur by chance and are subsequently used
in the Fisher’s exact test calculations.

To quantify the performance of GenomeRunner, we evaluated
three parameters for their impact on run time: (i) the number of
regulatory datasets; (ii) the number of SNP sets; (iii) the size of a
SNP set. Each run time evaluation included comparing the opti—
mized versus non—optimized statistical calculations. To evaluate the
effect of the number of regulatory datasets on run time, a set of
1000 randomly selected SNPs was run for the enrichment analysis
using from 100 to 1000 randomly selected regulatory datasets. To
evaluate how the number of SNP sets affects run time, 10—100 sets
of random SNPs, each with 1000 SNPs, were analyzed for enrich—
ment against 1000 randomly selected regulatory datasets
(Supplementary Figure S1).

2.91mplementation and availability

The GenomeRunner web server is implemented in Python 2.7. It
uses CherryPy for the web framework, Mako for web pages templat—
ing, and Celery for parallelizing analyses jobs. The enrichment ana—
lysis is built upon Kent utilities (Kuhn et (11., 2013), BedTools
(Quinlan and Hall, 2010), pybedtools (Dale et (11., 2011), bedops
(Neph et (11., 2012), tabix (Li, 2011) and R (Team, 2013). The front—
page interface is implemented using the Bootstrap framework and
jQuery U1. The interface of the results page is implemented using the
shiny R package. The heatmaps are created using D3, R/
Bioconductor functionality (Team, 2013), and the dendextend R
package (Galili, 2015). The GenomeRunner web server is available
at http://www.integrativegenomics.org, and can be run as a com—
mand line version. It runs best in Google Chrome 29+, Firefox 26+,
Safari 6+. The source code and documentation for the
GenomeRunner web server is available at https://github.com/mdoz
morov/genomerunner_web. The quick start guide is available at
https://github.com/mdozmorov/genomerunner_web/wiki. The R/
Bioconductor scripts used to perform the analysis of the 39 disease/
trait associated SNP sets are available at https://github.com/mdoz
morov/gwa52bed/tredmaster/autoimmune/R.GR.autoimmune.

3 Results

3.1 Defining regulatory mechanisms of complex
diseases

To illustrate how GenomeRunner can help to better understand
regulatory mechanisms that may be altered in complex diseases, and
their cell type specificity, we analyzed disease— and trait—associated
SNP sets from 39 well—powered GWASs (Farh et (11., 2014). These
include 21 immunologic diseases, four neurologic disorders, seven
metabolic traits and seven other traits (Supplementary Table S3).
Our analysis of the corresponding SNP sets was aimed to answer the
following questions: (i) How well can relationships among the

diseases be captured by the similarity of their functional impact? (ii)
Are there groups of diseases with different functional impact, and
what are these regulatory differences? (iii) What is the cell specificity
of the functional impact of each disease?

3.2 Genomic similarity among disease—associated SNP
sets correlates with knowledge—based disease similarity
The goal of the regulatory similarity analysis is to identify similarity
among diseases based on patterns of the regulatory enrichments of
their corresponding SNP sets (e.g. as determined by GWAS studies).
Because the regulatory similarity analysis is a novel idea, we utilized
several metrics to benchmark its performance in elucidating disease
similarity.

To establish a reference measure of similarity among the dis—
eases, we used the shared genomic loci method introduced in the ori—
ginal publication by Farh et al. (2014). This method measures
similarity by calculating the number of overlapping disease—associ—
ated loci, defined as 500 bp regions surrounding disease—associated
SNPs. Larger number of overlaps suggests higher similarity between
a pair of diseases. We also employed literature— and DO—based
approaches to measure disease similarity (Li et (11., 2011; Wren et
(11., 2004). Both approaches offer several metrics to measure disease
similarity (see ‘Methods’ section). Although each metric has been de—
signed to measure different aspects of disease—disease relationships,
they utilize the same framework of knowledge databases and DO
hierarchy. Therefore, we expected each metric to perform similarly
in capturing disease similarities. The literature— and DO—based
approaches can help to elucidate how well the shared genomic loci
and the regulatory similarity measures reﬂect current knowledge
about disease relationships.

The literature—based and the shared genomic loci—based measures
of disease similarity were highly correlated (median Spearman cor—
relation coefficient : 0.46, Supplementary Table S4), with the misn
metric best correlating with the shared genomic loci measure
(Spearman:0.49, P—value< 1.00E—16). The DO—based similarity
measures were also positively correlated with the shared genomic
loci—based measures, although to a lesser extent (median Spearman
correlation 0.30). These results suggest that the shared genomic loci
method can capture similarity among diseases analogous to known
relationships and serve as a reference to evaluate the performance of
the regulatory similarity analysis.

3.3 lmputed DNAse hypersensitive sites and histone
marks best capture genomic disease similarity

The regulatory similarities may be obtained by selecting different
categories of regulatory datasets, e.g. histone modification marks,
DNAse hypersensitive sites etc. (Supplementary Table S2). As each
category answers different biological questions about the regulatory
mechanisms involved, we tested each category separately. We com—
pared regulatory similarities obtained with each category vs. those
obtained using the shared genomic loci method. This approach was
aimed at identifying categories of regulatory datasets that provide
regulatory similarities best correlated with the shared genomic loci
similarity used as a reference.

Among the ENCODE regulatory datasets, regulatory similarities
based on the 161 regulatory datasets containing TFBSs were the
most similar to the shared genomic loci similarities (Spearman’s
r: 0.36, P—value:4.80E—12). Regulatory similarities based on his—
tone modification marks and DNAse hypersensitive site datasets
correlated less with the shared genomic loci similarities (Spearman’s
r: 0.29 and 0.16, respectively). Surprisingly, regulatory similarities

based on chromatin states that encapsulate combinations of other
regulatory marks (Ernst and Kellis, 2015) showed even less correl—
ation with the shared genomic loci similarities (median Spearman’s
r : 0.12). These results suggest selecting regulatory datasets is an es—
sential step in measuring regulatory similarity among SNP sets, and
highlights the importance of data—driven approach to analysis.

The Roadmap Epigenomics project provides experimentally and
computationally obtained regulatory datasets (‘processed’/‘imputed’
datasets, respectively, Supplementary Table S2). Furthermore, the
regulatory regions were obtained using either ‘broad peak’, or ‘gapped
peak’, or ‘narrow peak’ peak calling algorithms (Roadmap
Epigenomics et 41]., 2015 ). We used each category of Roadmap
Epigenomics datasets to identify regulatory datasets providing regula—
tory similarity best correlated with the shared genomic loci similarities.

The imputed regulatory data captured the relationships among the
diseases better than the processed data (median Spearman’s r: 0.61
versus 0.48, respectively, Supplementary Table S4). Furthermore,
regulatory similarities obtained using histone marks and DNAse
hypersensitive sites defined by the ‘gapped peaks’ algorithm showed
the best correlation with the shared genomic loci similarities (median
Spearman’s r: 0.66 and 0.54, respectively, Supplementary Table S4).
Notably, gapped peaks, which are broad domains that include at least
one narrow peak, have been recommended for use by the Roadmap
Epigenomics consortium (Roadmap Epigenomics et 41]., 2015), con—
firming our observations. Interestingly, using all regulatory data did
not improve correlations of regulatory similarities with the shared
genomic loci similarities (Spearman’s r: 0.55). These results indicate
that computationally imputed regulatory datasets, in particular those
with regulatory regions defined using the ‘gapped peak’ algorithm,
perform best to measure regulatory similarity among the diseaseJtrait—
associated SNP sets.

3.4 Autoimmune disease—associated SNP sets show
distinct regulatory enrichments from other disease/trait—
associated SNP sets

To compare regulatory similarities among the diseases represented
by the corresponding SNP sets, we performed principal components
analysis (PCA) of the disease—specific regulatory enrichment profiles.
To obtain disease—specific regulatory enrichment profiles, we used
imputed histone and DNAse ‘gapped peak’ regulatory data, al—
though using combinations of other regulatory datasets yielded com—
parable results (data not shown). The PCA shows the immunologic
diseases as the most regulatory distinct from the other diseases/traits
(Fig. 2). Hierarchical clustering of the disease—specific regulatory en—
richment profiles also grouped the immunologic disease—associated
SNP sets as the most distinct from metabolic, neurologic and other
diseases/traits (Supplementary Figure S3). We also visualized pairs
of diseases with maximum regulatory similarity, and observed a
similar grouping of immunologic diseases (Supplementary Table S6
and Supplementary Figure S4). This visualization highlighted known
relationships among the diseases, e.g. ulcerative colitis and ankylos—
ing spondylitis (Acheson, 1960), and strengthened disease similar—
ities currently under question, e.g. multiple sclerosis and celiac
disease (Mormile, 2015 ). These results demonstrate that SNP sets of
the diseases with similar pathologies are enriched in similar regula—
tory datasets, potentially altering similar regulatory mechanisms.

3.5 Two regulatory distinct groups of immunologic
disease—associated SNP sets

We noted two subgroups of immunologic diseases formed distinct
regulatory clusters (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Figure S3). Evaluating

Fig. 3. Regulatory similarity among 21 immunologic diseases. (A) Correlogram
of regulatory similarity among the diseases. Blue/yellow/red highlights nega-
tive/positive similarity between the disease-specific regulatory enrichment pro-
files, respectively, measured by Spearman correlation coefficients. Hierarchical
clustering is performed using ‘ward' metric. (B) Stability of the dendrogram of
regulatory similarity among the diseases. ‘AU/P', approximately unbiased/boot-
strap probabilities, respectively (see pvclust R package; Suzuki and Shimodaira,
2006 for details). Red rectangles highlight two clusters of immunologic diseases
supported by the data at 0:20.90 for AU probability. Red/green dendrograms
further highlights the two clusters (Color version of this figure is available at
Bioinformatics online.)

clustering stability of the regulatory enrichment profiles of 21 im—
munologic diseases with the pvclust R package (Suzuki and
Shimodaira, 2006) identified two stable groups supported by the
regulatory similarity data, each containing 12 and 9 diseases, re—
spectively (0120.90, Fig. 3B). These clusters were stable irrespec—
tively of combinations of the regulatory datasets used for regulatory
enrichment analysis (data not shown). These results suggest that
there are at least two groups of immunologic diseases with SNP sets
enriched in distinct regulatory datasets.

3.6 T helper cell regulatory features are strongly
enriched in a group of nine immunologic disease—
associated SNP sets

Having defined the two groups of immunologic diseases, we focused
on identifying regulatory differences between them. We compared

regulatory enrichments between the two groups for statistically sig—
nificant differences, i.e. identifying regulatory datasets significantly
enriched in one but not the other group. Focusing on the regulatory
data from 14 types of T cells and 9 types of B cells, we analyzed cat—
egories of histone modification marks, DNAse I hypersensitive sites
and chromatin states. When using Roadmap Epigenomics data, we
also investigated whether regulatory datasets defined using ‘broad—’,
‘narrow—’and ‘gapped’ peak calling algorithms will identify the same
differential regulatory features. This analysis of individual categories
of regulatory datasets simplifies interpretation of the observed regu—
latory differences.

Similar to Farh et al., we observed nearly all immunologic dis—
eases—associated SNP sets showing some degree of enrichment in the
regulatory datasets obtained from T helper cell subpopulations.
However, our differential regulatory analysis placed nine immuno—
logic diseases, ‘Multiple sclerosis’, ‘Celiac disease’, ‘Systemic lupus
erythematosus’, ‘Systemic sclerosis’, ‘Crohns disease’, ‘Primary bil—
iary cirrhosis’, ‘Ulcerative colitis’, ‘Ankylosing spondylitis’, ‘Primary
sclerosing cholangitis’ as being significantly stronger enriched in the
T helper cell—specific regulatory datasets (Supplementary Table S5).
These results demonstrate how the regulatory similarity and differ—
ential regulatory analyses can refine our understanding of the SNP—
regulatory associations. In summary, these observations position the
aforementioned immunologic diseases, referred hereafter as ‘group
2’, as preferentially driven by the regulatory changes in T helper cell
subpopulations, and suggest they may be best responsive to T helper
cell targeting therapies.

3.7 H3K4me1, histone acetylation marks and DNAsel
hypersensitive sites from T helper cells are enriched in
nine immunologic disease—associated SNP sets

Using regulatory datasets defined with ‘broad—’, ‘narrow—’ and
‘gapped peak’ algorithms, we noted that the analysis with ‘broad
peaks’ datasets identified more significant enrichment differences
(e.g. 74 differential enrichments using processed ‘broad peak’
Histone marks data versus 67 ‘gapped peak versus 39 ‘narrow peak’
data). We also observed that the computationally imputed data pro—
vides more differential enrichments than the processed data (e.g.
428 imputed ‘gapped peak’ Histone marks versus 67 processed
data). These observations corroborate our previous note that the
computationally imputed regulatory marks are better suited for the
regulatory enrichment analysis, and further suggest the use of
imputed data defined using the ‘gapped peak’ algorithm. We de—
scribe enrichment results using the imputed ‘gapped peak’ regula—
tory data throughout the rest of the manuscript unless noted
otherwise, and providing the results obtained with the other data
types in the Supplementary Table S5.

In addition to the enhancer H3K4me1 mark, we observed the en—
richment of several histone acetylation marks in the T helper cell
subpopulations. H3K27ac, a mark associated with transcription ini—
tiation and open chromatin structure, was the most frequently en—
riched, followed by H4K12ac, H2BK120ac, H4K91ac (marks of
transcription start sites), H3K14ac (critical for the recruitment of
TFIID at the IFN—gamma locus) and other marks (Supplementary
Table S5 ). Consistently, the ‘group 2’—associated SNP sets are en—
riched in DNAse hypersensitive sites in the primary T helper PMA—I
stimulated cells (P—value : 1.62E—6 versus 9.32E—2 in the ‘group 1’
diseases) and other subpopulations of T helper cells. Taken together,
these observations suggest that the ‘group 2’ diseases are associated
with SNPs that may alter enhancers in the promoters of actively
transcribed T helper cell—specific genes.

3.8 Enhancers in T helper cells subpopulations are
enriched in the nine immunologic disease—associated
SNP sets

To summarize combinatorial interactions of the regulatory marks
into well—defined chromatin states, we used chromatin state data ob—
tained using the ChromHMM learning system (Ernst and Kellis,
2012). Using data containing 15 chromatin states, we identified en—
hancers (‘7Enh’) as the most significantly enriched in the ‘group 2’—
associated SNP sets. Enhancers from the primary T helper cells from
peripheral blood were the most significantly enriched in the ‘group
2’ SNP sets (P—value:2.72E—5 versus 1.35E—1 in the ‘group 1’ dis—
eases, difference P—value:5.20E—2). The ‘group 2’ SNP sets were
also significantly enriched in enhancers of other T helper cell subpo—
pulations, and depleted in quiescent regions (‘15Quies’,
Supplementary Table S5). Analysis of 18 and 25 chromatin states
identified similar enrichment differences and suggested involvement
of enhancers in the Primary T CD8+ naive and memory cells from
peripheral blood (Supplementary Table S5). These results position
the nine immunologic diseases from ‘group 2’ as likely to be driven
by the regulatory changes in enhancers of T helper cells.

3.9 Cell type regulatory enrichment analysis identifies
known cell specificity of the diseases

Numerous groups have reproducibly demonstrated that disease—
associated variants are enriched within regulatory regions in pheno—
typically relevant cell types (Ernst et (11., 2011; Gusev et (11., 2014;
Karczewski et (11., 2013; Maurano et (11., 2012; McVicker et (11.,
2013; Schaub et (11., 2012; Thurman et (11., 2012; Trynka et (11.,
2013; Ward and Kellis, 2012). Having established T helper cell sub—
populations as potentially being affected in the nine immunologic
diseases, we aimed to identify cell type specificity of all 39 disease/
trait—associated SNP sets. The goal of the cell type regulatory enrich—
ment analysis is to identify cell specificity of the regulatory datasets
most frequently and most significantly associated with a SNP set.
Under the hypothesis that disease—associated SNPs are dispropor—
tionally enriched in regulatory features in the cell types most rele—
vant to the disease, GenomeRunner’s cell type regulatory
enrichment analysis aims to identify these cell types.

As there’s no de facto standard definition of cell types specific
for any of the diseases and traits analyzed in our study, we used
common knowledge about disease pathology and compared our re—
sults with observations made by Farh et al. (2014). Similar to their
observations, SNP sets associated with neurologic diseases were
highly enriched in brain—specific regulatory datasets (Supplementary
Table 7). Similarly, SNP sets associated with metabolic traits, such
as ‘Fasting blood glucose’, ‘HDL/LDL cholesterol’, were the most
frequently enriched in regulatory datasets from pancreatic islets, adi—
pose tissue, liver. Notably, we observed ‘Fasting blood glucose’ and
‘Type 2 diabetes’ as being enriched in ‘Fetal heart’—specific regula—
tory datasets (P—values 3.24E—22 and 4.65E—28, respectively), con—
firming well—known link between diabetes and cardiovascular
diseases (reviewed in Stolar and Chilton, (2003). Other trait—associ—
ated SNP sets also showed relevant cell type specificity of the regula—
tory enrichments, such as ‘creatine levels’ association with lung
fibroblast primary cells (P—value 1.57E—21) and muscle cells, ‘bone
mineral density’ association with chondrodyte cells (P—value 1.95E—
22) and other similar observations (Supplementary Table S7). These
results strengthen our observation that the disease—specific genomic
changes are enriched in the regulatory datasets from relevant cell
and tissue types.

Although we did not restrict cell type regulatory enrichment ana—
lysis to any particular cell type, we observed predominant associ—
ation of T helper cell subpopulations and other immune cell types
with the immunologic SNP sets. Similar to Farh, et al. (2014), we
observed association of a few diseases, such as systemic lupus ery—
thematosus, Kawasaki disease and primary biliary cirrhosis with B
cell—specific regulatory datasets (Supplementary Table S7). We also
observed significant enrichment of the ‘ulcerative colitis’ SNP set in
the regulatory datasets from rectal mucosa, colon and intestine tis—
sues (P—value:5 .23E—14), consistent with its bowel pathology.
Other notable observations include ‘type 1 diabetes’ association
with cells from placenta, adrenal gland, and pancreas (P—value:5.
28E—19). Concurrent with Farh et al. (2014) we ascertain that the
cell type regulatory enrichment analysis allows a more focused in—
sight into the cell type—specific effect of genetic variants upon regula—
tory context.

4 Discussion

The GenomeRunner web server is a significant improvement of our
work on automating and simplifying the search for biologically in—
terpretable relationships among high—throughput data (Dozmorov,
2015; Dozmorov et (11., 2012, 2013, 2014; Sawalha and Dozmorov,
2015). Designed to be intuitive and fast, its downstream analyses en—
able interpretation of a wide range of biological problems, such as
defining subgroups of patients by the regulatory similarity of the pa—
tient—specific SNP sets. We illustrate novel insights that can be ob—
tained with GenomeRunner by analyzing 39 disease/trait associated
SNP sets. Using regulatory datasets as a common reference,
GenomeRunner was able not only detect known relationships
among the diseases, but also identify a subgroup of immunologic
diseases with SNPs strongly enriched in enhancers of T helper cell
subpopulations. We further identified cell types relevant to disease
pathology, with regulatory mechanisms likely to be altered by the
corresponding SNPs.

To our knowledge, only three studies have investigated the use
of similarity of patient—specific genomic information for classifica—
tion purposes (Bakir—Gungor and Sezerman, 2011; Hofree et (11.,
2013; Wang et (11., 2014). However, these studies use gene—centric
reference to map SNPs to pathways and gene interaction networks,
the idea we have also independently explored (https://github.com/
mdozmorov/PathwayRunner). The regulatory similarity approach
implemented in GenomeRunner is gene agnostic in that it uses regu—
latory datasets across the whole genome as a reference. This ap—
proach is expected to be especially useful in interpreting the
functional impact of rare and non—coding genomic variants identi—
fied from whole genome sequencing.

Despite being a powerful tool for genomic data interpretation,
GenomeRunner has some limitations. For example, its statistical
model currently accommodates analysis of SNPs (point mutations)
only. Although SNPs comprise ~95 % of genomic variants
(Genomes Project et (11., 2012), contribution of InDels (Ribeiro—Dos—
Santos et (11., 2015), Copy Number Variants (CNVs) (Curtis et (11.,
2012), structural variants (Kasowski et (11., 2010) should also be
considered as they are responsible for a much greater percentage of
altered base pairs (Genomes Project, et (11., 2012). Our future work
includes accommodating genomic variants other than point muta—
tions into the statistical framework of GenomeRunner.

The other feature of GenomeRunner is that SNPs are considered
as independent. Our goal here was to keep the structure of
GenomeRunner maximally simple, speed up statistical calculations,
and put minimal requirements on the user—provided input files.

Consequently, the interpretation—oriented analyses of GenomeRunner
may be the final step in bioinformatics pipelines that preprocess the
data, impute poorly genotyped regions and account for linkage dis—
equilibrium (LD) depending on study prerequisites. If considering LD
is crucial, we refer the user to the GoShifter enrichment tool (Trynka
et (11., 2015) that uses LD information from the Phase I 1000 genomes
data release and estimates enrichments by local permutations.
However, regulatory similarities among the 39 disease/trait—associated
SNP sets obtained with GoShifter correlated less well with the shared
genomic loci similarities (Supplementary Table S4). With the release
of Phase IH 1000 Genomes data (Genomes Project et (11., 2015 ), we
plan to include optional LD filtering for different populations.

The current version of GenomeRunner does not integrate other
types of ‘omics’ information, such as mRNA and microRNA expres—
sion, and DNA methylation, shown to be well suited for the patient
classification (Curtis et (11., 2012; Wang et (11., 2014). Our future ap—
plication of GenomeRunner to the analysis of patient—specific muta—
tion profiles includes integrating these layers of information and
connecting the results with phenotype information. This integration
will allow better understanding of the regulatory changes leading to
disease manifestation.

In summary, we describe the GenomeRunner web server for
identifying regulatory mechanisms potentially affected by the func—
tional impact of SNP sets. Furthermore, we provide a means to com—
pare different SNP sets by similarity of their regulatory enrichments.
Used in connection with other tools, we hope the GenomeRunner
web server will aid in understanding the epigenomic alterations
associated with pathogenic genomic changes in complex genomics—
driven diseases.

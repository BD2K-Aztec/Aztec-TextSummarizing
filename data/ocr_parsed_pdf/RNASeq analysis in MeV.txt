ABSTRACT

Summary: RNA-Seq is an exciting methodology that leverages the
power of high-throughput sequencing to measure RNA transcript
counts at an unprecedented accuracy. However, the data generated
from this process are extremely large and biologist-friendly tools with
which to analyze it are sorely lacking. MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV)
is a Java-based desktop application that allows advanced analysis
of gene expression data through an intuitive graphical user interface.
Here, we report a significant enhancement to MeV that allows
analysis of RNA-Seq data with these familiar, powerful tools. We also
report the addition to MeV of several RNA-Seq-specific functions,
addressing the differences in analysis requirements between this
data type and traditional gene expression data. These tools include
automatic conversion functions from raw count data to processed
RPKM or FPKM values and differential expression detection and
functional annotation enrichment detection based on published
methods.

Availability: MeV version 4.7 is written in Java and is freely available
for download under the terms of the open-source Artistic License
version 2.0. The website (http://mev.tm4.org/) hosts a full user manual
as well as a short quick-start guide suitable for new users.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNA-Seq proﬁles the transcriptome (the complete set of transcripts
in a cell) using high-throughput deep sequencing. This technique
compares favorably to previously used methods for gene expression
measurement, such as DNA microarrays, because of its higher
sensitivity, lower background and ability to detect previously
unknown transcripts. However, the base pair level resolution of this
sequencing-based method generates volumes of data that are difﬁcult
to process and analyze on desktop computers. This massive scale of
data output presents a problem for biologists with little access to
‘big iron’ computer resources and the programming skills required
to use them.

The ﬁrst part of this problem, already in large part addressed
by the bioinformatics community, is that of processing, storing
and retrieving vast amounts of raw sequencing data, quantifying
it and mapping it to the genome. Applications such as Bowtie

(Langmead et al., 2009), SOAP (Li et al., 2008a), MAQ (Li et al.,
2008b) and RMAP (Smith et al., 2008) map the reads from RNA-
Seq to the reference genome or assemble them into contiguous
sequences. These methods are rapidly becoming standardized; core
facilities and automated pipelines perform these steps along with
an additional summarization step, providing pre-mapped expression
data most often in a transcript-by sample matrix format similar to
that generated by DNA microarrays.

This compressed format loses information about the sequences
of the original transcripts, but provides the basic data that most
scientists need to address their experimental questions while
avoiding difﬁculties presented by the identiﬁability of individuals
via patterns of genomic variation (Habegger et al., 2011).

The second Challenge is similar to that faced by scientists using
early DNA microarrays: the biologists who designed the experiments
need easy-to-use tools with which to explore their data. Users of
RNA-Seq data need access to robust statistical methods, exploratory
data analysis tools and approaches to ﬁmctional meta-analysis to
identify patterns in their data, transcripts that correlate with their
experimental phenotypes and the mechanisms at the heart of their
experimental systems.

Here, we report the adaptation of the MeV (Saeed et al., 2003,
2006) gene expression analysis tool for this purpose. MeV is a
java-based desktop application that wraps an extensive array of
Clustering, statistical and visualization tools in an easy-to-leam
graphical user interface. MeV was downloaded >32 000 times in the
past calendar year and the current version builds on nearly 10 years
of development. Our work in adapting MeV to RNA-Seq analysis
has included extending MeV’s data model to work with existing
transcriptomic analysis tools and the addition of a suite of published
algorithms speciﬁcally designed for RNA-Seq data analysis.

2 FEATURES

The latest release of MeV has been adapted to load, annotate,
visualize and analyze RNA-Seq data. A schematic showing the
possible workﬂow for RNA-Seq analysis using MeV is shown in
Figure 1. The most signiﬁcant Changes in MeV’s architecture have
been adjustments to its data model that allow loading of read counts,
normalized transcript expression levels, transcript lengths and read
library sizes. The new RNA-Seq ﬁle loader supports the import
of this type of data from a simple, tab-delimited format, Clearly
documented in the user manual. In the process, MeV automatically
annotates the data, loading transcript/ gene level annotation from the
UCSC or Ensembl databases. It can load discrete count level data as
well as expression data (as RPKM or FPKM values). Raw sequence

counts per transcript are converted to RPKM values automatically
and vice versa, using the RPKM method described in Mortazavi et al.
(2008). The application framework makes it easy to add other data
formats as the community develops new standards for RNA-Seq.

Once the data have been loaded and annotated, it can be analyzed
using both existing tools and new modules that address RNA-Seq-
speciﬁc issues, such as transcript length and abundance biases.
There are three differential expression analysis methods based
on the Bioconductor packages DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010),
DGESeq (Wang et al., 2010) and EdgeR (Robinson et al., 2010) that
analyze differential expression using RNA-Seq-speciﬁc statistics.
For the user, the transition from array to sequence data analysis is
seamless as these modules are built on the same user interface that
has made MeV’s methods widely accessible. Since most scientists
are interested in understanding the ﬁmctional differences in gene
expression between experimental groups, we also created a module
based on GOSeq, a Bioconductor package that tests for enrichment
of gene lists (Young et al., 2010). These algorithms allow MeV
to account for RNA-Seq—speciﬁc data biases, such as transcript
length bias in which more reads are mapped to longer transcripts,
and selection bias, the overdetection of highly expressed transcripts
(Oshlack and Wakeﬁeld, 2009).

In addition, users can apply the now standard analysis functions
in expression analysis, such as hierarchical clustering, k-means
clustering, t-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), EASE (the
DAVID algorithm, Dennis et al., 2003) and many others. Heatmap
displays, gene expression graphs and tabular listings are all included

in the standard MeV data displays. Gene-level annotation is linked
to appropriate online databases, such as Entrez and Gene Ontology,
and can be accessed with simple hyperlinks. Genes of interest can
be labeled and compared with one another, and stored as basic gene
identiﬁer lists or as tab-delimited ﬁles containing expression data
for analysis in other applications.

3 CONCLUSIONS

We have publicly released MeV 4.7 with new features allowing
the loading and analysis of RNA-Seq data within the framework of
existing methods while adding four new RNA-Seq-speciﬁc modules
based on robust, published algorithms. With these new features,
scientists can apply the familiar tools of clustering, differential
expression analysis and visualization to an entirely new type of data.
These modules are built on the same simple user interface that has
made MeV accessible to researchers of all computer literacy levels.
Already, the unannounced beta release has been downloaded 2200
times, providing some indication of the perceived need for tools
such as MeV within the community.

This release also provides a framework for the further
development of RNA-Seq analysis tools, and the easy addition of
new R-based modules. The MeV development team looks forward
to including additional modules speciﬁc to RNA-Seq data analysis
as they are developed and published by the community.

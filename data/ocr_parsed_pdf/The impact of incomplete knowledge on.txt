ABSTRACT

Motivation: The automated functional annotation of biological macro-
molecules is a problem of computational assignment of biological
concepts or ontological terms to genes and gene products. A
number of methods have been developed to computationally annotate
genes using standardized nomenclature such as Gene Ontology (GO).
However, questions remain about the possibility for development of
accurate methods that can integrate disparate molecular data as well
as about an unbiased evaluation of these methods. One important
concern is that experimental annotations of proteins are incomplete.
This raises questions as to whether and to what degree currently
available data can be reliably used to train computational models
and estimate their performance accuracy.

Results: We study the effect of incomplete experimental annotations
on the reliability of performance evaluation in protein function predic-
tion. Using the structured-output learning framework, we provide the-
oretical analyses and carry out simulations to characterize the effect of
growing experimental annotations on the correctness and stability of
performance estimates corresponding to different types of methods.
We then analyze real biological data by simulating the prediction,
evaluation and subsequent re-evaluation (after additional experimental
annotations become available) of GO term predictions. Our results
agree with previous observations that incomplete and accumulating
experimental annotations have the potential to significantly impact ac-
curacy assessments. We find that their influence reflects a complex
interplay between the prediction algorithm, performance metric and
underlying ontology. However, using the available experimental data
and under realistic assumptions, our results also suggest that current
large-scale evaluations are meaningful and almost surprisingly reliable.

1 INTRODUCTION

Assigning function to gene products is of primary importance in
biology, yet with the overwhelming abundance of sequence data
in the post-genomic era, only a small fraction of gene products
have been annotated experimentally. Therefore, it has become
important in computational biology to predict function based on
sequence, structure and other data when experimental annota-
tions are unavailable (Friedberg, 2006; Punta and Ofran, 2008;
Rentzsch and Orengo, 2009). With the development of a large
number of function prediction methods, there is a need for
unbiased assessment of these methods. Community-based

challenges, such as MouseFunc (Pena-Castillo et al., 2008) and
the Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA)
(Radivojac et al., 2013), have emerged to address this problem
through the prediction of ontological annotations. The objective
in the CAFA challenge, for example, is to predict a set of Gene
Ontology (GO) terms associated with a given protein, where G0
is a hierarchical knowledge representation of functional descrip-
tors (terms) organized in a large directed acyclic graph
(Ashburner et al., 2000).

To evaluate the performance of function prediction methods
properly, a set of metrics needs to be established. At the same
time, an important challenge we face when assessing the perform-
ance of these methods is that because of the incremental nature
of scientiﬁc discovery, our knowledge of any given protein’s
function is likely to be partial. Therefore, a function prediction
that is originally assessed as a false positive may be discovered to
be a true positive at a later stage, and similarly, a prediction that
is initially assessed as a true negative may later be discovered to
be a false negative. This problem of incomplete data has led to
doubts regarding the reliability of evaluations of protein function
prediction algorithms (Dessimoz et al., 2013; Huttenhower et al.,
2009).

The problem of incomplete data in the training and assessment
of classiﬁers has been recognized both in computational biology
(Huttenhower et al., 2009) and machine learning (Elkan and
Noto, 2008; Rider et al., 2013). Huttenhower et a]. have con-
cluded that the effect of missing annotations can produce mis-
leading evaluation results because the classiﬁers are differentially
impacted. This results in the re-ranking of classiﬁers upon re-
evaluation at a time when more experimental annotations are
available. Similarly, Rider et a]. (2013) studied the problem in
the framework of asymmetric class-label noise, in which negative
examples contain some mislabeled data points. However, both
studies only considered a binary classiﬁcation scenario, e. g. when
a predictor is developed for a particular term in the ontology.

Here we study the effect of incomplete experimental annota-
tions on the quality of performance assessment of protein func-
tion prediction methods. To that end, we consider protein
function prediction as a structured-output learning problem in
which a classiﬁer is expected to output a totality of (interdepend-
ent) GO terms for a given sequence. We consider both topo-
logical and information-theoretic metrics and analytically
derive under what conditions the initial performance evaluation
will underestimate or overestimate the true accuracy. Then, we
provide simulations to characterize the impact for different types
of predictors. Finally, we analyze experimental protein function
data by simulating the CAFA experiment. Our results regarding
the potential impact of incomplete data on correctness of evalu-
ation largely agree with previous studies. However, under

realistic assumptions, we provide evidence that the impact of
missing data on reliable evaluation is surprisingly small. As a
result, this study provides conﬁdence that large-scale perform-
ance evaluation of protein function predictors is useful. In add-
ition, our study raises concerns about potentially different
conclusions that can be reached when protein function is studied
as a series of binary classiﬁers versus using a structured-output
learning formulation.

2 METHODS

2.1 Protein function prediction formulation

We consider protein function prediction within a structured-output leam-
ing framework. Given a training set of labeled input objects {(xi, ya}; 1,
where each x e X and y e y, the objective is to infer a relationship
f: X —> y that minimizes some loss function. The input space X consists
of proteins, whereas the output space y is a set of all consistent subgraphs
of some underlying directed acyclic graph such as GO. Here, by saying
‘consistent’, we mean that if any term v from G0 is used to annotate a
protein x e X (either experimentally or computationally), all the ances-
tors of v up to the root(s) of the ontology must also be included as an
annotation of x.

2.2 Evaluation of prediction accuracy

To understand how the incomplete functional annotations inﬂuence ac-
curacy estimation, we ﬁrst review two representative evaluation schemes
in this domain. For simplicity, we shall consider that the evaluation set,
either through a hold-out set or cross-validation, consists of a single
protein with its experimental annotation T and a prediction P created
by some classiﬁer. This single protein can be considered to be an average
case when a larger evaluation set is available. We use V to refer to the
entire set of terms in the ontology; thus, with a minor abuse of notation,
we write that T g V and P g V. Typically, V is a large graph with tens of
thousands of nodes, Tis a small graph with about 1(P100 nodes, whereas
P depends on a particular classiﬁer under evaluation.

F-measure. Given a protein with its non-empty consistent annotations
T and P, the precision (pr) and recall (rc) are calculated as

|Pﬂ T| lPﬂ Tl
IPI lTl ’

 

 

pr(P, T): and rc(P, T):
where |P| is the number of predicted terms, |T| is the number of experi-
mental terms, and |P ﬂ T| is the number of correctly predicted terms by
the model. We will also refer to these quantities using the following no-
tation: tp= |P ﬂ T| as true-positive ﬁndings, fp= |P — T| as false-positive
ﬁndings, tn = |P ﬂ Tl as true-negative ﬁndings and fn = |T — P| as false-
negative ﬁndings. Here, P: V— P is the complement of P, and T is
the complement of T. The F-measure of the predicted annotation is
deﬁned as

pr(P’7)‘rc(P’D
1521741”, D+rC(P, T),

where ,8 is a positive number. Here we only consider ,8: 1, which results
in the F-measure that represents a harmonic mean between precision and
recall.

Semantic distance. Semantic distance is based on an assumption that
the prior probability of a protein’s experimental annotation can be mod-
eled by a Bayesian network in which the conditional probability tables are
calculated from data (Clark and Radivojac, 2013). Here, we calculate
misinformation (mi) and remaining uncertainty (ru) as

mi(P,T)= Z ia(v) and ru(P,T)= Z ia(v),

VEP7T VET7P

Fﬂ(P, T): (1 +382)

where v e V is a vertex in the graph, 73(v) is a set of its parents, Pr(v|73(v))
is the probability that a protein is experimentally annotated by v given
that all its parents are a part of the annotation, and ia(v) = — log
(Pr(v|73(v)) is information accretion.

Semantic distance between two consistent graphs P and Tis deﬁned as

ska), T): (rt/(P, 7)+mf‘(P, 7))%

for any k 3 1. Here we only consider k = 2; thus, S2 is the Euclidean
distance between the point (ru(P, T), mi(P, 7)) and the origin of the co-
ordinate system.

It is important to mention that both evaluation schemes are applied at
the protein level. That is, they provide prediction accuracy on each test
protein and are typically averaged over a set of proteins. A different
group of metrics, those that evaluate a predictor’s performance for a
particular term v in the ontology (e.g. ‘catalytic activity’), may also be
used. In this case, an area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve and the term-based F-measure are routinely used (Sharan et al.,
2007). However, these metrics are reliable only if a test set contains
a sufﬁciently large number of proteins experimentally annotated by
term v. In addition, it is not clear how to average term-based evaluations
over all (interdependent) terms in the ontology to rank two classiﬁers on
a given set of proteins. Thus, term-based metrics are not considered in
this work.

2.3 The problem of incomplete annotations

The process of functional annotation of proteins starts with experimental
research in which a protein is revealed to be involved in certain biochem-
ical and cellular activities. After the publication, this information is fur-
ther processed by biocurators who then assign functional annotation to
the protein using standardized vocabularies such as GO. Each protein-
terrn association is further assigned a set of evidence codes that document
the nature of the experiment used to interrogate a protein’s activity.

Although this process has several layers of control, there are a number
of challenges that inﬂuence the quality of annotation. For example, pro-
teins may be multifunctional and display different types of activities
under different biological and experimental contexts. Similarly, owing
to the technical limitations the assays used to determine their function
may not provide sufﬁciently detailed evidence. For those reasons, while
the experimental annotations assigned to a protein are generally reliable,
they are unlikely to be complete. Two important questions, both theor-
etically and empirically, emerge: (i) How useful are these available anno-
tations for training of computational models? (ii) To what extent can
these partial annotations be reliably used to estimate the accuracy of
computational models before the complete experimental annotation is
available? We focus on the problem of evaluation.

To formalize our approach, we consider two evaluation scenarios: the
original evaluation on incomplete data and another evaluation at a later
point in time when additional experimental annotations become avail-
able. For simplicity, we shall refer to the latter scenario as evaluation on
complete data. We will use T to denote a protein’s incomplete experimen-
tal annotation, T’ to denote the complete annotation, where T g T’, and
refer to T’ — T as new annotation. Predicted annotations P are generated
only once, at the time of original evaluation. Applying the same naming
convention, we use pr, rc, etc., to refer to precision, recall, and other
incomplete-data metrics, respectively, whereas we use pr’, rc’, etc., for
their equivalents on complete data. Our goal is to study and understand
the relationship between corresponding metrics, such as pr and pr’, rc and
rc’, F1 and Ff, etc.

2.4 The impact of new annotations on F1

We analyze the impact of incomplete annotations on accuracy estima-
tion using two confusion matrices, one provided at the time of original
evaluation and the other at a later point in time when additional

there are 8 = |T’ — T| new annotations; of those, or terms were predicted

as negatives by the predictor, whereas ,8 terms were predicted as positives.
The incomplete-data precision (pr) and recall (rc) are deﬁned as

 

 

[[7 [I7
r = rc =
p tp +fp tp +fn ’
whereas the F-measure can be written as
2t
F1 = —1’.
2tp +fp +fn

On the other hand, as illustrated in Figure 1, the complete-data precision
(pr’) and recall (rc’) can be expressed as

 

+ +
r’ = tp ’8 and rc’ = —tp ’8 .
tp-i-fp tp+fn+a+,8
The complete-data F-measure (F ’1) then becomes

F, = 2 I up + 18)
1 2tp+fn +fp+a+s
We ﬁrst observe that pr’ 3 pr because ,8 3 0. The change of precision
A1,, = pr’ — pr: ,8/(tp +fp). On the other hand, the relationship between
rc’ and rc is less obvious. We express the change in recall A". = rc’ — rc as
_ to + 15 to
tp+fn+a+,8 tp-i-fn
_ ,8 ‘fn — or » tp
(tp +fn)(tp +fn + a + 13) '
By recognizing that rca = ,B/(Ot‘l‘ ,8) is the recall on the new annotations,
it follows that the originally estimated recall increases if rca >rc.
Similarly, for the change in F-measure, we derive that
,sc—(awwp
c » (c + or + ,8) ’

where c= 2tp +fp +fn. The above equation leads to the following unex-
pectedly simple result

Z 0  r 65 Z — F1

We see that to maintain the performance upon receiving new annotations,

the predictor must have a recall on T’ — T greater than one half of the
original F1.

2.5 The impact of new annotations on Sz

We illustrate the analysis of information-theoretic metrics in Figure 2.
Analogous to the analysis of F1, we introduce three non-negative
quantities to describe the impact of new annotations on the semantic

distance as

mation after the set of experimental annotations changes from T to T,
where T g T’. P is a set of predicted terms determined by leaf annotation
nodes [71 and [72; T is a set of incomplete-data experimental terms deter-
mined by t1 and t2; T’ is a set of complete-data experimental terms deter-
mined by leaf annotation nodes t1, t2, t3 and t4. The changes are illustrated
(A) using a Venn diagram and (B) using a directed acyclic graph

and 8 = or + ,8. Thus, the complete data remaining uncertainty and misin-
formation become

ru’=ru+ot and mi“=mi—,8.

Note that (ru, mi) 6 R2; thus, S2 can be recognized as the L2-norrn of this
vector. The absolute value of the change of semantic distance AS, can be
bounded as follows

IA52I =  _ S2I
=1|I(ru+06,Mi— ,5)I12 — ||(ru,mi)II21

5 ||(0t, ,8)||2 (by Minkowski inequality)

However, without further assumptions, the difference in semantic dis-
tance can either be positive or negative depending on the performance
of a predictor on the new experimental annotations.

2.6 Simulations

Here we show the simulation results for both topological and informa-
tion-theoretic metrics under reasonable assumptions. For the simulation
related to F-measure, we assume that the recall on new data equals the
recall on complete data as well as statistical independence between
(tp +fn) and 8, which together deﬁne the level of incompleteness.
Values of these two variables were sampled from a distribution estimated
using new experimental annotations from Swiss-Prot provided between
January 2011 and January 2014; see next section. The parameter ,8 was
generated from a binomial distribution Bin(8, rc).

The simulation for semantic distance was conducted in an analogous
way. Here we sampled y: Eva ia(v) and 8 independently and generated
the ratio ,8/8 using a Beta distribution B(y — ru, ru). While the beta dis-
tribution was chosen out of convenience, it allowed us to control that
[E[,8/ 8] = (y — ru)/ru, i.e. that the fraction of information content of Tthat
was correctly predicted was unchanged on the new annotations.

Note that in both cases, trials were discarded if the generated values
were invalid, i.e. if,8>fp (Fig. 3) or y<ru (Fig. 4). Figures 3 and 4 show
the impact averaged over 10 000 trials for each GO classiﬁcation.
Simulation results under several other conditions are provided in
Supplementary Materials.

prediction challenge similar to CAFA (Radivojac et al., 2013),
with three methods as virtual participants: GOtcha, BLAST and
Swiss-Prot computational annotation (evidence codes: ISS, ISO,
ISA, ISM, IGC, IBA, IBD, IKR, IRD, RCA and IEA). Swiss-
Prot experimental annotations (EXP, IDA, IMP, IPI, IGI, IEP,
TAS and IC) were used as gold standard.

The evaluation was performed as follows: (i) All methods were
trained on 42570 experimentally annotated proteins from the
January 2010 version of Swiss-Prot and then initially evaluated
on proteins that were unannotated in 2010 but acquired anno-
tations between January 2010 and January 2011, (ii) January
versions of Swiss-Prot from 2012, 2013 and 2014 were then
used to collect a set of proteins that were experimentally anno-
tated between 2010 and 2011, but then acquired additional an-
notations after January 2011. Such experiment allowed us to
understand the extent to which new experimental annotations,
3 years after original data collection, affected the initial esti-
mates of performance accuracy. The experiment is illustrated in
Figure 5.

We refer to the performance evaluation on the 2011 data as
initial evaluation. Similarly, the evaluation on the data from sub-
sequent years is referred to as re-evaluation. Each re-evaluation
was performed as if the data at that point was complete. Finally,
we note that all proteins for which the Swiss-Prot curators
removed any GO terms at any point between 2011 and 2014
were ignored in this experiment. This excluded 2323 (53%; of

3.1 Participating methods

BLAST This method assigns a score to a sequence-term asso-
ciation according to the highest sequence similarity between the
target sequence and any of the training sequences that are ex-
perimentally associated with that term. More formally, the score
for the target sequence q and term v was computed as
Bv(q)=max,,egv{—log e(q,s)}, where e(-, -) denotes the E—value
between two sequences as returned by the BLAST alignment
(Altschul et al., 1997), and 8,, is a set of training sequences ex-
perimentally annotated with term v. The cutoff for E-value was
set to 1.0 such that all scores were non-negative.

GOtcha Instead of assigning the maximum similarity among all
sequences associated with a particular term v, GOtcha aggregates
the evidence collected from multiple similar sequences (Martin
et al., 2004). A normalization step is subsequently taken to
enforce that the final score is within the range [0, 1]. That is,

Gv(q)=rv(q)/rrooi(q), where rv(q)= - ZseS, 10g e(as) is called
the r-score for the sequence q and term v.

Swiss-Prat As the third method for comparisons, we simply
retrieved all non-experimental annotations from the January
2010 version of Swiss-Prot.

3.2 Evaluation metrics

The ﬁrst set of evaluation metrics was identical to those used in
the CAFA challenge (Radivojac et al., 2013). Because BLAST
and GOtcha output soft scores, their performance is visualized
using precision-recall curves. As a single number to rank the
methods, we calculate Fmx , which is the maximum F-measure
over the entire range of decision thresholds (Radivojac et al.,
2013). Similarly, we calculate misinformation and remaining un-
certainty over the range of possible decision thresholds and use
the minimum semantic distance to rank methods (Clark and
Radivojac, 2013).

We note that Swiss-Prot experimental annotations do not have
confidence scores; thus, the Swiss-Prot computational annota-
tions can be presented as a single point in the pr-rc or the
ru—mi plane.

The impact of incomplete knowledge on the evaluation of protein function prediction

 

3.3 Results

Figures 6 and 7 show the performance of each method in the pr-
rc and ru—mi planes, separately for each of the three classiﬁca-
tions in GO. Here, the incomplete-data evaluations (2011) for
each method are shown as solid gray curves. On the other hand,
color-coded curves are used to visualize the performance on in-
complete data (solid curves, full circles) and complete data
(dotted curves, empty circles) on the subsets of proteins that
acquired new annotations in the periods from 2011 to 2012
(green), 2011 to 2013 (blue) and 2011 to 2014 (red). Note that
the complete-data evaluations on the entire set of proteins are
not shown as the curves would overlap solid gray curves.
Tables 174 summarize the performance evaluation using Fmx
and Smin after a 3 year period during which new annotations
were allowed to accumulate in the Swiss-Prot database.

The results shown in Figures 6 and 7 and Tables 174 provide
evidence that the effects of incomplete annotations are ontology-
speciﬁc, metric-specific and algorithm-speciﬁc. The impact on
Fmx was relatively small; within 2 percentage points on the

entire dataset (Table 1) and within 5 percentage points when
the evaluation was restricted to the proteins that accumulated
new annotations (Table 2). The impact on Smin , on the other
hand, was larger and suggests that the initial evaluations are
consistently overestimating the quality of performance. The over-
all change of Smin in the 3 year period was within 1 bit of
information for Molecular Function and Cellular Component
classiﬁcations, and within 3 bits for Biological Process
(Table 3). When the evaluation was restricted to the subset of
proteins that accumulated new annotations, this difference
became more signiﬁcant: within 6 bits for Molecular Function
and Cellular Component and within 12 bits for Biological
Process (Table 4).

Fig. 7. Information-theoretic evaluation on each GO classiﬁcation using (A) GOtcha, (B) BLAST, and (C) Swiss-Prot predictions from January 2010.
Solid gray curves (ﬁlled circles) represent performance of each method using proteins that did not have experimental annotation in 2010 but were
experimentally annotated in January 2011. Color curves show evaluation on those proteins from the 2011 set that accumulated new annotations in 2012
(green), 2013 (blue) and 2014 (red). Solid curves (ﬁlled circles) show incomplete-data evaluation on each subset of proteins, whereas dotted curves (empty
circles) show complete-data evaluation

addressed the evaluation problem, both theoretically and empir-
ically, by considering function prediction within a structured-
output learning framework. We find that the nature and level
of incompleteness in the data, types of classiﬁcation models and
performance evaluation metrics are all contributing factors to the
complexity of understanding evaluation bias.

Both simulations and empirical evaluation suggest that the
inﬂuence of incomplete annotations on topological metrics, 3
years after the initial assessment, may result in either overesti-
mated or underestimated performance, but the effect is generally
small. The reason for this can probably be found in the cancel-
lation of effects of increasing precision and potentially decreasing

recalliresulting, surprisingly, in relatively stable F-measure
estimates. On the other hand, information-theoretic metrics
appear to be more sensitive to data incompleteness. Here we
ﬁnd that the semantic distance generally increases on real data,
which is likely a consequence of the fact that the newly added
experimental annotations are typically deep in the ontology and
thus contribute signiﬁcantly toward the overall performance
measurements.

The classiﬁcation algorithms are differentially impacted by
data incompleteness as well. In particular, we observe that
those tools that operate in the low-precision high-recall region
of the pr-rc plane are the most signiﬁcantly impacted by missing
annotations. Finally, we find that the level of incompleteness in
Swiss-Prot is not large enough to seriously impact accuracy as-
sessments. The data available to us, however, were only analyzed
3 years after the initial evaluation, therefore not signiﬁcantly
eliminating the possibility for larger changes in light of novel
biological discoveries.

In summary, evaluation of function prediction methods at any
given time is not error-free. When there is an interest in speciﬁc

functions for speciﬁc gene products, predictions that are dis-
covered at a later time to be true-positive predictions or false-
negative predictions because of missing data may be problematic.
However, when comparing methods on large datasets, assessing
the performance of protein function prediction methods provides
meaningful information about their accuracy and usefulness,
with a quantiﬁably low error rate.

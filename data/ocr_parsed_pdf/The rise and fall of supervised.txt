Machine learning is of immense importance in bioinformatics and
biomedical science more generally (Larraﬁaga et al., 2006; Tarca
et (11., 2007). In particular, supervised machine learning has been
used to great effect in numerous bioinformatics prediction methods.
Through many years of editing and reviewing manuscripts, we
noticed that some supervised machine learning techniques seem to
be gaining in popularity while others seemed, at least to our eyes,
to be looking ‘unfashionable’.

We were motivated to create a league table of machine learning
techniques to learn what is hot and what is not in the machine
learning ﬁeld. In this editorial, we only include those that we
considered major league and leave analysis of the minor league
methods as an exercise for the interested reader. To create our league
table, we created a list of supervised machine learning techniques
commonly used in bioinformatics and their common synonyms,
plural forms and abbreviations. We then searched this list against
the PubMed titles and abstracts to identify the number of papers
published per year for each machine learning technique. To match as
many papers as possible, searches were case insensitive and allowed
for variation in hyphenation.

To our surprise, the artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) is not only
the dominant league leader in 2011 but has been in this position
since at least the 1970s (see Fig. 1). However, in recent years the
usage of support vector machines (SVMs) grew tremendously, and
we predict that SVMs will challenge ANNs for the dominant position
in the coming decade. Since 2007 the number of publications using
ANNs has decreased by 21%, which we hypothesize may be directly
attributed to researchers increasingly using SVMs in place of ANNs.
SVMs caught up with and overtook Markov models in 2004 to gain
second spot in our machine learning league.

As for the question of ‘what is hot?’, one can see that Random
forests are a rapidly growing method with not a single mention of
them before 2003 and now a total of 407 papers published to date.

We were hoping to ﬁnd techniques that were not so hot and
perhaps going out of fashion. The results show that none of the
major league methods has gone out of fashion, but we do see
moderate decreases in the use of both ANNs and Markov models in
the literature.

We were also curious to ﬁnd out if certain machine learning
techniques were used in combination with each other. To investigate
this, we looked at what machine learning methods are co-mentioned
in articles (See Fig. 2). For all pairs of methods from the Supervised

Machine Learning Top-5, we counted the number of abstracts that
mention both methods and normalized the counts with the number
of co-occurrences that would be expected by chance (based on
the frequencies with which the methods are mentioned over the
years). The strongest correlation (185 times higher than random
expectation) is seen between decision trees and random forests,
which is to be expected as random forests are ensembles of decision
trees. Apart from this, the next strongest correlation (88 times higher
than random expectation) is found between the two newest methods
on the list, namely SVMs and random forests. We hypothesize that
this is due to many researchers using these algorithms through
machine learning frameworks such as Weka (Frank et al., 2004),
which allows many different algorithms to easily be applied to the
same dataset.

Applications of supervised machine learning methodology
continue to grow in the biomedical literature. Despite new methods

growing in usage, for example support vector machines and random
forests, we see little evidence that any widely adopted methods are
falling out of use.

Conﬂict oflnterest: none declared.

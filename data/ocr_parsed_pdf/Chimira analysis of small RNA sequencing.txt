Abstract

Summary: Chimira is a web—based system for microRNA (miRNA) analysis from small RNA—Seq
data. Sequences are automatically cleaned, trimmed, size selected and mapped directly to miRNA
hairpin sequences. This generates count—based miRNA expression data for subsequent statistical
analysis. Moreover, it is capable of identifying epi—transcriptomic modifications in the input se—
quences. Supported modification types include multiple types of 3’—modifications (e.g. uridylation,
adenylation), 5’—modifications and also internal modifications or variation (ADAR editing or single
nucleotide polymorphisms). Besides cleaning and mapping of input sequences to miRNAs,
Chimira provides a simple and intuitive set of tools for the analysis and interpretation of the results
(see also Supplementary Material). These allow the visual study of the differential expression be—
tween two specific samples or sets of samples, the identification of the most highly expressed
miRNAs within sample pairs (or sets of samples) and also the projection of the modification profile
for specific miRNAs across all samples. Other tools have already been published in the past for
various types of small RNA—Seq analysis, such as UEA workbench, squuster, MAGI, OASIS and
CAP—miRSeq, CPSS for modifications identification. A comprehensive comparison of Chimira with
each of these tools is provided in the Supplementary Material. Chimira outperforms all of these
tools in total execution speed and aims to facilitate simple, fast and reliable analysis of small RNA—
Seq data allowing also, for the first time, identification of global microRNA modification profiles in
a simple intuitive interface.

Availability and implementation: Chimira has been developed as a web application and it is ac—
cessible here: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/enright/software/chimira.

1 Introduction

 

Small RNA sequencing data are among the most straightforward
types of NGS data to analyse. However many laboratories that gen—
erate such data still struggle to develop or adapt computational pipe—
lines for the analysis and interpretation of these data. Additionally,
in recent years, it has been reported that many miRNAs go through
post—transcriptional alterations that modify their 3’ end, mainly via
mono/poly—Uridylation (Heo et al., 2009, 2012) or poly—
Adenylation (Shanfa et (11., 2009). Such modifications are believed

to impart significant functional changes to the miRNA. Indeed,
other modifications and/or editing have also been observed to occur
in several other instances (Burroughs et (11., 2010; Sung—Chou et (11.,
2012; Yu and Chen, 2010). Hence, it is imperative to explore the
full profile of all modifications and/or edits that can be identified in
small RNA—Seq data. The functional roles of small RNAs in differ—
ent conditions may be greatly inﬂuenced by such modifications.
This can be accomplished by aligning small RNA sequences against
their hairpin precursors. The alignment region spanning each

miRNA is analysed to detect bases in the miRNA sequence that
could not possibly have derived from the precursor it aligns to.
These unalignable nucleotides are likely either: (i) base—calling
errors, (ii) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), (iii) ADAR edits
or (iv) post—transcriptional miRNA modifications (e.g. via
TUTases). Base—calling errors are pseudo—random depending on the
platform used and usually more likely to occur towards the 3’ end of
sequences. In order to study this diverse pool of possible miRNA
post—transcriptional modifications, we have developed Chimira.
This is a cohesive platform for the processing and analysis of small
RNA NGS data allowing simultaneous detection of 3’, 5’ and in—
ternal miRNA modifications.

2 Input

Chimira accepts FASTQ/FASTA files as input, containing adapter
and/or barcode stripped small RNA—Seq data. The user is provided
with a simple system for uploading each sample and replicate and
selecting among the available run options. Additionally, Chimira
provides a limited 3’ adapter cleaning functionality using reaper
(Davis et al., 2013) supporting different adapters for each input
sample. Finally, the system provides a simple interface for computa—
tionally determining likely 3’ sequencing adapters in case the user
does not have this information.

3 Usage notes

In its current release (v1.0), Chimira supports mapping of small
RNA—Seq data against 209 genomes registered in miRBase
(Griffiths—Jones et al., 2008). In order to optimize and speed—up the
analysis, tally (Davis et al., 2013) is being used for de—duplicating
the sequence fragments. Tally dramatically reduces the size of input
sequence files by collapsing identical sequences into a single one
while storing the total read depth. When input sequence files are
uploaded and the appropriate genome is selected, the user is able
to launch a new queued job. Every job is submitted to a high—
performance computing cluster and the user can follow its progress
via an analysis console. Notification via e—mail upon completion of
each job is also available, provided the user has supplied a valid
e—mail address before launching the job.

4 Methods

Two types of miRNAs identification are provided: Plain Counts and
Modiﬁcations. Plain Counts refers to the quantification of the
miRNA molecules that are expressed in any form (template or modi—
fied) in each of the input samples. The input sequences are mapped
against miRBase using BLASTn (Boratyn et al., 2013) allowing up
to two mismatches for each sequence. BLASTn output is filtered so
that antisense matches are discarded. The extracted counts are nor—
malized across all samples using DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) and
basic QC plots are provided together with plots for the total counts
per sample and the top—10 miRNAs expression levels across all sam—
ples. In cases where a small RNA sequence identically matches more
than one precursor sequences (i.e. miRNA paralogues) the user can
choose between calling only the first optimal alignment hit or as—
signing counts fractionally with equal weights between the
paralogues. Apart from the quantification of miRNA counts and the
prevalence of modifications, Chimira integrates basic functionality
for comparative analysis of input samples. Specifically, differential
expression (of plain counts) between two samples or sets of samples
can be visualized through an interactive scatterplot that allows the

user to view the miRNA identifier and the different expression levels
at each point of the plot (Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, the
user can display the 10, 20 or 50 most highly expressed miRNAs in
two samples (or sets of samples) side by side.

Secondly, ‘modifications’ refers to the quantification of any se—
quence segments that are part of the input sequences and cannot be
explained by genomic sequence. In the example shown (Fig. 1), uri—
dylation and adenylation are the most prevalent modification types
in the 1 nt after the 3’ end of the miRNAs, while C modifications are
highly enriched exactly at the 3’ end. ADAR editing is the predomin—
ant modification type in the internal modifications followed by a
moderately expressed C—SNP, 11 nt upstream of the 3’ end (index
position: 11).

The types of modifications being identified include:

' 3’-modiﬁcations: any non—templated sequences in a window that
starts at the 5th nt upstream of the 3’ end of each miRNA and
ends at the 6th nt downstream of the 3’ end.

' 5’-modiﬁcations: any non—templated sequences in a window that
starts at the 8th nt upstream of the 5’ end of each miRNA and
ends at the 5th nt downstream of the the 5’ end.

' Internal modiﬁcations: SNPs and ADAR edits. In order for a
modiﬁcation to be classiﬁed as a SNP, an arbitrary 70% value is
used as a threshold for the ratio of the modiﬁed counts to the
overall counts.

It is worth noting that the window lengths being used for identi—
fication of 3’ and 5’ modifications include nucleotide positions also
within the original miRNA sequence to better distinguish all pos—
sible modifications from multiple miRNA variants originating from
the same precursor but with different length mature products.
Modification types are inferred from BLAST alignments of input se—
quences to their hairpin precursors and then examining the content
of alignment mismatches returned. In order to decipher the correct
modification position a reference database has been built initially
for all supported genomes, containing canonical alignments between
mature miRNAs and their hairpin precursors. Based on these data
each of the identified modification patterns is assigned a position
index (Supplementary Table S1) in order to build the full depth—wise
modification profile. Chimira also allows the display of the modifi—
cation profiles across all samples for a specific miRNA, defined by

the user. Finally, all counts (plain and modifications) can be down—
loaded for further analysis as separate files as soon as the processing
of a set of samples is complete.

5 Conclusion

Chimira has been specifically developed for fast analysis of simple
small RNA datasets with a user—friendly interface. It complements
our previous pipeline sequenceImp, which was designed for
command—line level analysis of larger—scale experiments with com—
plex designs. Chimira is a fast and robust system for the cleaning,
filtering, QC and mapping of small RNA—Seq data aiming to sim—
plify the process of small RNA NGS analysis to a straightforward
online workflow. Additionally, it allows the extraction of glo—
bal modification profiles across and within each of the input sam—
ples thus allowing the inference of correlations between certain
modification patterns and any conditions indicated by the input
samples. We hope the system will prove useful to the small RNA
community.

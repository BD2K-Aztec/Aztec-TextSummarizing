Abstract

Motivation: Genome—wide association studies revealed that most disease—associated single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are located in regulatory regions within introns or in regions
between genes. Regulatory SNPs (rSNPs) are such SNPs that affect gene regulation by changing
transcription factor (TF) binding affinities to genomic sequences. Identifying potential rSNPs is cru—
cial for understanding disease mechanisms. In silico methods that evaluate the impact of SNPs on
TF binding affinities are not scalable for large—scale analysis.

Results: We describe affinity testing for regulatory SNPs (atSNP), a computationally efficient
R package for identifying rSNPs in silico. atSNP implements an importance sampling algorithm
coupled with a first—order Markov model for the background nucleotide sequences to test the sig—
nificance of affinity scores and SNP—driven changes in these scores. Application of atSNP with
>20 K SNPs indicates that atSNP is the only available tool for such a large—scale task. atSNP pro—
vides user—friendly output in the form of both tables and composite logo plots for visualizing SNP—
motif interactions. Evaluations of atSNP with known rSNP—TF interactions indicate that atSNP is

able to prioritize motifs for a given set of SNPs with high accuracy.

1 Introduction

Genome-wide association studies have been instrumental in identify-
ing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with large
numbers of phenotypes. The vast majority of association SNPs are
in non-coding regions, suggesting that they may have regulatory
roles in deriving the phenotype (Maurano et (11., 2012). In particular,
regulatory SNPs which alter binding affinity of transcription factors
and affect gene expression constitute an important class of such
SNPs (Pai et (11., 2015). A standard in silico approach for identifying
rSNPs is by evaluating how the SNP-driven nucleotide change im-
pacts binding affinity of TFs to the region surrounding the SNP
(Macintyre et (11., 2010; Riva, 2012; Thomas—Chollier et (11., 2011;
Andersen et (11., 2008). Specifically; the DNA sequences around each
SNP are scored against a library of TF motifs with both the reference

and the SNP alleles using position weight matrices (PWMs) (Stormo
et (11., 1982) of the motifs. SNPs with significantly different scores
between the reference and SNP alleles are then hypothesized as
rSNPs.

We describe atSNP; an R package that carries out the following
tasks for every SNP-motif combination of the input data after ex-
tracting genome sequences of small windows (:30 bps) around the
SNP positions: (i) computing affinity scores for both alleles; (ii) stat-
istical testing for allele-specific affinity scores; (iii) statistical testing
for changes in affinity scores between alleles. A few existing tools
can perform various subsets of these tasks (Table 1). The most dis-
tinctive feature of atSNP is its ability to accommodate large scale
analysis (e.g. over>20K SNPs). is-rSNP has the most similar func-
tionality to atSNP; however; is-rSNP (both 1.0 and 2.0) can only

Poretools

 

nanopore during the event. The squiggle utility permits visu—
alization of this information (Fig. 1C). The Oxford Nanopore
base—calling software uses a Hidden Markov Model to predict a
fragment’s sequence based on this event data. We anticipate that
the events utility (and others) will help developers explore im—
proved base—calling strategies.

2.3 Python library for data analysis

The utilities provided in the poretools suite will inevitably
prove to be insufﬁcient for every analysis that a researcher
wishes to conduct. Recognizing this, we have developed a
Python programming interface that researchers can use to dir—
ectly access the sequence data, the raw nanopore event data and
other metadata (e. g. the ﬂowcell and run identifiers) contained in
one or more FASTS files. To demonstrate of the Python inter—
face, the following code reports the start time, the speciﬁc
nanopore and the based—called sequence for each FASTS ﬁle in
a sequencing run.

from poretools import FastSFileSet
fast5s = Fast5FileSet(’/path/to/fast5/ﬁles/’)
for fast5 in fast5s:
start = fast5.get_start_time()
porenum = fast5.get_channel_number()
fq = fast5.get_fastq()
print porenum, start, fq.seq, fq.qual
fast5.close()

3 DISCUSSION

The poretools software helps solve pressing requirements for
analysis of nanopore sequencing data. By focusing on the Python

development environment and adopting expected interface con—
ventions as popularized by other popular bioinformatics tools
such as samtools (Li et al., 2010) and bedtools (Quinlan
et al., 2009), we expect that users will be able to rapidly exploit
the functionality offered by this software. We anticipate that
other toolkits will become available written in other program—
ming languages. Further efforts are required for downstream
analysis for common tasks including alignment and de novo as—
sembly of both event and base—called sequence data from this
platform.

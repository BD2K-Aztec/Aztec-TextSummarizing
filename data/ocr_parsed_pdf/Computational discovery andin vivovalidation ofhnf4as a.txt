Abstract

Motivation: Automated computational methods can infer dynamic regulatory network models dir—
ectly from temporal and spatial experimental data, such as genetic perturbations and their result—
ant morphologies. Recently, a computational method was able to reverse—engineer the first mech—
anistic model of planarian regeneration that can recapitulate the main anterior—posterior
patterning experiments published in the literature. Validating this comprehensive regulatory model
via novel experiments that had not yet been performed would add in our understanding of the re—
markable regeneration capacity of planarian worms and demonstrate the power of this automated
methodology.

Results: Using the Michigan Molecular Interactions and STRING databases and the MoCha soft—
ware tool, we characterized as hnf4 an unknown regulatory gene predicted to exist by the reverse—
engineered dynamic model of planarian regeneration. Then, we used the dynamic model to predict
the morphological outcomes under different single and multiple knock—downs (RNA interference)
of hnf4 and its predicted gene pathway interactors ﬁ-catenin and hh. Interestingly, the model pre—
dicted that RNAi of hnf4 would rescue the abnormal regenerated phenotype (tailless) of RNAi of hh
in amputated trunk fragments. Finally, we validated these predictions in vivo by performing the
same surgical and genetic experiments with planarian worms, obtaining the same phenotypic out—
comes predicted by the reverse—engineered model.

Conclusion: These results suggest that hnf4 is a regulatory gene in planarian regeneration, validate
the computational predictions of the reverse—engineered dynamic model, and demonstrate the
automated methodology for the discovery of novel genes, pathways and experimental
phenotypes.

restore its head—trunk—tail pattern is a very difficult inverse problem
(Lobo et al., 2014). This has led to a lack of mechanistic, fully—
specified models that can explain simultaneously more than one or
two features of planarian regeneration (Lobo et al., 2012; Umesono
et al., 2013).

In order to solve this inverse problem, heuristic computational
methods have been proposed for the reverse—engineering of dynamic
models directly from experimental data (Bonneau et al., 2006;
Schmidt and Lipson, 2009; Sirbu et al., 2010; Yeung et al., 2002),
including biological development (Becker et al., 2013; Crombach
et al., 2012; Jaeger et al., 2004; Manu et al., 2009; Perkins et al.,
2006; Reinitz et al., 1995, 1998). These computational methods rep—
resent a promising approach to build systems—level models that can
mechanistically explain the complex biological processes that are
not only necessary but also sufficient for the observed exquisite
regulation of growth and form.

Following this approach, the most comprehensive dynamic
model of planarian regeneration was recently reverse—engineered
with an automated computational method (Lobo and Levin, 2015).
Directly from a dataset of outcomes of functional (surgical and gen—
etic perturbation) experiments including the main head versus tail
phenotypes, the method inferred a dynamic genetic regulatory net—
work that could recapitulate all the experimental phenotypes when
simulated in silico. Importantly, the model predicted the existence of
unknown regulatory genes inferred as necessary for the correct regu—
lation of planarian regeneration. Finding these unknown predicted
products would aid in our understanding of planarian regeneration
and serve as a validation of the reverse—engineered model in particu—
lar and the computational methodology approach in general.

We thus used the model to attempt to uncover new biological
signaling and predict the outcomes of experiments that have never
been performed. Here, we present the discovery of hnf4 (hepatocyte
nuclear factor 4) as a planarian regulatory gene and its predicted
capacity by the reverse—engineered model to rescue an abnormal tail—
less phenotype. In addition, we tested these predictions in vivo by
performing the same surgical and genetic experiments in the planar—
ian worm, which validated all the predicted results by the reverse—
engineered model.

2 Methods

2.1 Planarian culture

An asexual clonal line of Schmidtea mediterranea (CIW4) was main—
tained at 20°C in the dark, in 0.5 g/l Instant Ocean salts (Spectrum
Brands, U.S.A.) added to ultrapure water. They were starved for at
least a week before microinjection and double—stranded RNA inter—
ference (RNAi) experiments.

2.2 Double—stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi)

For double—stranded RNA interference experiments, dsRNA was
generated and injected as described by Oviedo et al. (2008). dsRNA
of each gene were microinjected into the worms of 7mm in length,
either as single gene dsRNAi, or mixed with another dsRNA for
double—dsRNAi, while the amount of each dsRNA introduced was
maintained constant. dsRNA injection was performed for 3 consecu—
tive days, followed by amputation of the planaria into 3 regions
(head, pharynx and tail) 5 h after the third and last injection.
Amputations were performed under a dissecting microscope with a
scalpel, on filter paper over a moist Kimwipe kept chilled on a cold
plate. Pharynx fragments were produced by transversely cutting the
worms immediately anterior and posterior of the pharynx.

Fragments were kept in welled non—treated tissue—culture plates in
the dark at 20°C to regenerate, and moved into fresh media and
new wells once a week, until scored.

2.3 Image collection, measurements and statistics
Images were collected using a Zeiss Stemi SV 6 dissecting micro—
scope, with a Canon EOS Rebel T3i DSLR camera. All measure—
ments were carried out using images of worms when fully extended.
Adobe Photoshop was used on images of the regenerated pharyngeal
fragment to categorize the pixels as belonging either to the head,
trunk, or tail regions within the entire regenerating fragment and the
pigment—less anterior and posterior blastemas. A custom script in
Matlab was developed and used to automatically count the pixels in
each region and calculate the ratios.

3 Results

3.1 Characterization of the predicted unknown
regulatory gene as hnf4

The most comprehensive dynamic model of planarian regeneration,
recently reverse—engineered with a computational method (Lobo and
Levin, 2015), predicted an unknown regulatory gene necessary for
the correct regeneration of the planarian worm (Fig. 1A, labeled
with ‘P’). The model predicted that this unknown gene was regulated
(directly or indirectly) by both ﬁ-catenin (MiMI gene id CTNNB1)
and 17/7 (hedgehog, MiMI gene id SHH). We then used this informa—
tion to search for possible candidates in the Michigan Molecular
Interactions database (MiMI) (Tarcea et al., 2009), which resulted
in the identification of HNF4A (MiMI gene id 3172) in Homo sapi-
ens as the only known candidate to be regulated by both [f-catenin
(MiMI interaction id 48746) and 51717 (MiMI interaction id 228335)
(Fig. 1B).

We further validated these interactions with the software tool
MoCha (Lobo et al., 2016). MoCha uses the STRING database v10
(Szklarczyk et al., 2015) and facilitates the identification of path—
ways with unknown products. We queried MoCha for candidate
products directly interacting with both [f-catenin (ctnnb1) and 5/717
(shh) in any organism and with no score limitations. The tool con—
firmed that HNF4A is a candidate for such regulations in Homo sa-
piens, Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus. Table 1 shows the
scores of the interactions found in the three species.

Interestingly, an homolog of HNF4A (hnf4) exists in the planar—
ian Schmidtea mediterranea, and it has been found to be expressed
in intestinal cells and in interspersed cells surrounding the intestine,
including neoblasts (planarian stem cells) (Wagner et al., 2011), to
be involved in intestinal regeneration (Forsthoefel et al., 2012), and
to be expressed in the gamma neoblasts’ subpopulation (van
Wolfswinkel et al., 2014). Furthermore, other homologs of HNF4A
has been found to regulate blastema formation in amputated axolotl
limbs (Jhamb et al., 2011). Together, these data suggests that hnf4
may be indeed a regulatory gene in planarian regeneration.

3.2 In silico morphological predictions of single and
double knock—downs of hnf4 and its interacting genes
We then used the reverse—engineered dynamic model of planarian re—
generation to predict the morphological outcomes of amputated
trunk pieces with single and double knock downs (RNAi) of hnf4
and its predicted interacting genes [f-catenin and 17/7 (Fig. 1C).
Consistent with the input dataset of experiments used to automatic—
ally infer the model, the control experiment resulted in the wild—type
morphology, the knock down of [f-catenin resulted in a double—head

morphology (Gurley et al., 2008; Iglesias et al., 2008; Petersen and
Reddien, 2008), and the knock down of 17/7 resulted in a tailless
morphology (Rink et al., 2009).

Then, we used the model to formulate novel predictions regard—
ing the predicted hnf4 regulatory gene and its interactors. As shown
in Figure 1C, the simulation of a single knock down of hnf4 resulted
in a wild—type morphology (similar to the control), a double knock
down of ﬁ-catenin and hnf4 resulted in a double—head morphology
(similar to the single knock down of ﬁ-catenin), and, remarkably, a
double knock down of 17/7 and hnf4 resulted in a wild—type morph—
ology, instead of the tailless morphology of the single knock down
of [7/7. In this way, the reverse—engineered model formulated the non—
trivial prediction that RNAi of hnf4 would rescue the tailless pheno—
type due to RNAi of [7/7.

3.3 Validation of the regulatory role of hnf4 with single
and double RNAi in vivo experiments

We then validated all the in silico predictions made by the reverse—
engineered model with similar in vivo experiments in the planarian
worm. Similarly to the simulations, trunk pieces were amputated
under single and double RNAi knock downs (Fig. 2A). The in vivo
results (Fig. 2B) showed that while RNAi of hnf4 resulted in the re—
generation of the wild—type morphology, RNAi of ﬁ-catenin resulted
in a double—head morphology and RNAi of 17/7 resulted in a tailless
morphology, as it was predicted by the reverse—engineered model.
Then, the in vivo experiments showed that a double RNAi of li-
catem'n and hnf4 still resulted in the double—head morphology, but,
remarkably, a double RNAi of 17/7 and hnf4 restored the wild—type

morphology, instead of the tailless morphology obtained by the sin—
gle RNAi of 17/7. These results validated the ability of RNAi of hnf4
to rescue the tailless morphology, as it was predicted by the reverse—
engineered model.

Additionally, we performed a statistical analysis of the area sizes
of the regenerated tails under the different RNAi treatments (Fig. 3).
The analysis confirmed that while there were no statistical difference
in the tail area ratio between the control and the single RNAi of
hnf4, the single RNAi of 1717 produced morphologies with statistic—
ally significant smaller tail area ratios. In the case of double RNAi
of 17/7 and hnf4, there were no statistical difference of the tail area
ratios with respect the controls; however, the tail area ratios of the
double RNAi morphologies were statistically larger than the single
RNAi of 17/7 morphologies. This statistical study validated the

4 Discussion

Here, we presented the computational discovery and in vivo valid—
ation of hnf4 as a regulatory gene in planarian regeneration.
Starting from the prediction of an unknown necessary gene from a
reverse—engineered dynamic model, we characterized it with the use
of the MiMI and STRING databases and the MoCha tool. Then, we
used the reverse—engineered dynamic model to produce exact predic—
tions of the regenerated morphologies when perturbing hnf4 and
their regulatory interacting genes in the predicted pathway. This in
silico study revealed the ability of RNAi of hnf4 to rescue the abnor—
mal regenerated phenotype (tailless) due to the RNAi of 1717.

We then used an in vivo approach to validate at the bench all the
predictions of the model. Using RNAi to knock—down single and
double genes involved in the pathway, we performed similar surgical
amputations and genetic knock downs (RNAi) in planarian worms.
The results confirmed that RNAi of hnf4 produced the wild—type
morphology when applied alone, but when combined with RNAi of
17/7, it rescued the tailless phenotype caused by RNAi of 17/7 alone. A
statistical analysis further confirmed the significance of these results.
In summary, these results show how the reverse—engineered model
remarkably predicted a non—trivial regulatory role of hnf4 in planar—
ian regeneration.

The dynamic nature of the presented model explains in a mech—
anistic way the morphologies resulting from the different perturb—
ations. When both 17/7 and hnf4 are knock—down, the level of tail
signal is naturally higher than the trunk signal; that is, the default
outcome is tail. When only hnf4 is knock—down, the tail signal is
even higher (since 17/7 enhances tail) and the trunk signal stays the
same than in the double knock—down, so the wild type morphology
is still regenerated. However, when only [7/7 is knock—down, hnf4 is
higher expressed (since 17/7 represses hnf4), which results in a higher
signal of trunk (since hnf4 enhances trunk) and higher than tail
(which is also lower than the wild type, since 17/7 enhances tail), pro—
ducing the no—tail morphology. Finally, with no knock—downs, the
presence of 17/7 produces higher signal of tail and reduces the signal

of trunk (since 17/7 enhances tail and represses hnf4, which enhances
trunk), resulting in the wild type morphology.

5 Conclusion

Computational approaches are indispensable for the construction of
predictive models of complex biological phenomena and the under—
standing of their regulatory networks. These methods can automat—
ically formulate mathematical models that can recapitulate the
observed phenotypes. Crucially, these reverse—engineered models
can formulate testable predictions, including the prediction of novel
regulatory elements and experimental phenotypes.

Here, we validated the novel predictions of a comprehensive dy—
namic model of planarian regeneration, including the discovery of a
novel regulatory gene (hnf4) and its capacity to rescue an abnormal
phenotype. The model accounts for the minimum set of interactors
needed to explain the resultant head versus tail morphology from a
comprehensive set of perturbation experiments. In a future work,
we will validate the second unknown regulatory gene predicted by
the model, which was preliminary characterized as the Frizzled fam—
ily of receptors (Lobo and Levin, 2015). Further regulatory elements
are indeed needed to control other aspects of tail regeneration, such
as the specific round shape, determination of tissue types (epithe—
lium, muscle, nerves, etc.) in the correct locations, and the dorsal—
ventral axis regulation. Adding perturbation experiments involving
these elements to the input dataset will allow for the discovery of
more detailed models by the reverse—engineering system, extending
the pathways presented here.

This work serves as a proof of principle for a pipeline for con—
verting models discovered by machine learning into predictive
hypotheses that can be tested at the bench to uncover novel biolo—
gical interactions. Interaction databases such as MiMI or STRING
enable the characterization of unknown elements predicted by these
models. Importantly, the interaction confidence scores included in
these databases summarize the quality of the available evidence and
can be used to rank candidate interactions, being the ones with
higher score the best candidate interactions to test at the bench. This
approach demonstrates the strength of automated reverse—
engineering methods for the discovery of predicted mechanistic
models of developmental and regenerative biology.

Abstract

Motivation: Genome—wide association studies (GWASs) are commonly applied on human genomic
data to understand the causal gene combinations statistically connected to certain diseases.
Patients involved in these GWASs could be re—identified when the studies release statistical infor—
mation on a large number of single—nucleotide polymorphisms. Subsequent work, however, found
that such privacy attacks are theoretically possible but unsuccessful and unconvincing in real
settings.

Results: We derive the first practical privacy attack that can successfully identify specific individ—
uals from limited published associations from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium
(WTCCC) dataset. For GWAS results computed over 25 randomly selected loci, our algorithm al—
ways pinpoints at least one patient from the WTCCC dataset. Moreover, the number of re—identified
patients grows rapidly with the number of published genotypes. Finally, we discuss prevention
methods to disable the attack, thus providing a solution for enhancing patient privacy.

Availability and implementation: Proofs of the theorems and additional experimental results
are available in the support online documents. The attack algorithm codes are publicly available

experiments is available at http://www.wtccc.org.uk/ on request.

research (Homer et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009), which shows that it
is theoretically possible to re—identify individual participants using only
aggregate genomic data. Notably, Homer et al. (2008) describe the first
such method based on statistical hypothesis testing. This method re—
quires aggregate information from many genotypes (e.g. tens of thou—
sands) to obtain high confidence regarding an individual’s presence in
the aggregate. In contrast, a GWAS usually publishes statistics for a
much smaller number of genotypes. Therefore, using the approach sug—
gested by Homer et al., access to the whole genotype association data—
set would be necessary to accomplish this identification. Access to such
complete datasets is restricted and limited only to qualified biomedical
researchers with proper vetting (e.g. refer to NIH’s policy for sharing
GWAS data, http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice—files/NOT—OD—
07—088.ht1nl.). Wang et al. (2009) propose a more ambitious approach
that aims to find all genotypes for every patient in the GWAS. This at—
tack, however, rarely succeeds, because the number of unknowns far
exceeds the number of known values. In fact, Wang et al. (2009) report
only one particular synthetic GWAS involving 174 SNPs and 100 pa—
tients on which the attack succeeded. A follow—up study (Zhou et al.,
2011) tested this attack with GWAS instances from randomly selected
sets of SNPs and did not find any instance on which the attack suc—
ceeded. We conclude that none of the existing methods poses a direct
threat to GWAS participants” privacy based on the data that is pre—
sented in standard publications.

In data security, the development of effective countermeasures
requires the identification of a successful attack algorithm. In this
article, we devise a strong privacy attack on published GWAS
results, which successfully identifies specific patients by using a
strategy of constructing deterministic proofs of study inclusion.

2 Methods

2.1 Preliminaries and problem definition

A typical GWAS recruits two groups of individuals: cases (denoted
by Dc) and controls (denoted by Dt). Cases are patients of the dis—
ease under investigation, and controls are similar people without the
disease. Usually, each SNP has two possible alleles, called the major
allele (i.e. the more common allele on the SNP) and the minor allele
(the rarer one). Let A denote the major allele and a be the minor al—
lele, {AA, Aa, aa} are the three possible genotypes. Among the three
basic models, AA and Aa are taken as the same in the dominant
model, aa and Aa are not distinguished in the recessive model and
only the additive model takes Aa as an individual genotypes (Haines
and Pcricak-Vancc, 2006). Thus, GWAS with two genotypes is the
typical case and is the focus of this work. For the simplicity of pres—
entation, the two genotypes are denoted as 0 (major genotype)/1
(minor genotype), as used in previous studies, e.g. Fraser et al.
(2005); Hinncy et al. (2007); Ozcki et al. (201 1).

Suppose that the GWAS results involve a' loci of the human
genome, denoted as {g1, g2, - - - , gd}. In genetic model with two geno—
types, e.g. the dominant model and the recessive model, we represent
the genomic information of an individual by a d—dimensional binary
vector x,, in which each binary variable x,, represents the genotype of
x, on g,. Let Nc and N be the total number of cases and controls, re—
spectively. For each genotype g,, we define the following four counts
of individuals: n]? (respectively ), number of cases having genotype
0(respectively 1) on g,; n; (respectively  ), number of controls having
genotype 0(respectively 1) on g,.

A typical GWAS result includes NC, Nt and the following three
important statistics: the genotype frequency for each genotype,
the genotype—disease association of each genotype and the pairwise
correlation for each pair of genotypes.

2.1.1 Genotype frequency

The frequency of a minor genotype g): 1 is usually computed by
F; : I$+nNh, i.e. the ratio between the total number of individuals
having the minor genotype on g, and the total number of GWAS
participants.

2.1.2 Genotype—disease association

GWAS commonly uses the following equation to measure the asso—

ciation between a genotype (let g,) and the disease under study:

V‘ 2 (.1le +n/‘N‘C—‘F/Nﬁ2.
I (NC+N‘ —1-/)I-/NCN‘

tribution with freedom degree 1, following the standard procedure

(McDonald, 2009). The P value of the insignificant difference is

thus 1 — X2 (d), 1), in which we abuse x2(-,  to denote the accumula—

The asymptotical distribution of  is a x2 dis—

tive distribution function of x2 with specific degree of freedom.
In the following, we assume that the GWAS publishes the P values
defined above, denoted as P(V;), which is true for many GWASs
today. Note that our attack is not limited to this particular defin—
ition of genotype—disease association but works on any definition
in which n]? can be expressed as a function of V,, NC, Nt and Pi, such

as the one above.

2.1.3 Genotype—genotype correlation
For each pair of loci (say g, and g), there are four possible combin—
ations of genotypes, which are (0,0) (i.e. g,:0 and gk:0), (0,1),
(1,0) and (1, 1). Let Mloko, M321, Mill? and Mill: denote the number
of cases having each of these four combinations, respectively.
The correlation between g, and g, can be measured as follows:
m : Wiser—Mrwr .

(Mfg +M/1“) (Mfg +M/1k1) (MferMfg) (Mt): +M/1“)

also follows the asymptotical x2 distribution, with degree of freedom

 

Similar to V,, W

1. Therefore, the corresponding P value, P(Vl-k) : 1 — 12(Vl-k, 1) is
published as part of GWAS results.

We assume that the attacker possesses a candidate set D and the
genomic information of each individual in D. By ‘genomic informa—
tion’, we mean the set of genotypes published in the GWAS results.
We distinguish two situations, closed world and open world. Under
closed world assumption, the candidate set D is always a superset
of the GWAS cases Dc, i.e. Dc E D. Such a candidate set can be
obtained, for instance by a curious staff member of the hospital or
research center where the GWAS was conducted. Note that the can—
didate set D can contain much more people than the GWAS cases
Dc, e.g. D can be the set of all individuals whose genome sequences
are stored in the hospital or research center. On the other hand,
under the open world assumption, the patients in Dc may not be
completely covered by the candidate set D known by the adversary.

1 proofs, which are single genotypes on the loci included in the
co—occurrence matrix M. In our example, there are 12 such proofs,
i.e. genotype 0 and 1 for each of g1, g6. The frequency of each
of these proofs is derived directly from the diagonal values of M,
e.g. the frequency of (g1 : 1) is MH : 3. We discard proofs with
zero frequency, e.g. (g4 : 0), as they do not match any patient in
the cases. Next, we construct length—2 presence proofs (e.g.
(g1 : ng : 0)), each by combining two length—1 proofs (e.g. (g1
: 1) and (g2 : 0)). We compute the frequency of each length—2
proof as well, from the frequencies of length—1 proofs and the co—oc—
currence matrix. For instance, the frequency of (g1 : 1, g2 : 0) is
computed by subtracting M (the number of cases with minor geno—
type on both g1 and g2) from the frequency of (g1 : 1). Again, we
discard zero—frequency proofs. A proof of length 522 is built by
merging (i.e. taking the set union of all genotypes) two proofs of
length 5 — 1 that differ in exactly one genotype. For example (g1 : 1,
g2 : 0,g3 : 1,g4 : 1) can be built by merging (g1 : 1,g2 : 0,g3
: 1) and (g1 : 1, g2 : 0,g4 : 1). In general, the frequency of a
proof with length at least 3 cannot be computed directly from the
co—occurrence matrix. Instead, we derive a lower bound and an
upper bound for each such proof as shown in Lemma 1. We discard
proofs with a frequency lower bound of 0, since they might not
match any case. The iterative process continues until no additional
proofs can be obtained. In the supporting document, we provide an
analysis of the probability of obtaining a proof of a given length,
based on the characteristics of the genomic domain.

2.5 Step 3: re—identifying cases from candidates

Given the genome sequence of a suspected study participant, the
final step of the attack is to check whether the suspect is among
the cases in the GWAS. From the set of presence proofs obtained in
the previous step, we discard each proof that is a subset of another
proof. Then we match the suspect’s genome sequence against each
proof; if an exact match is found, then we declare the suspect to be a
case. When the genome sequence of the suspect is known before
the attack begins, we can significantly speed up processing by only
generating proofs that match the suspect’s genome sequence.

Given the set of all presence proofs generated in Step 2, we dis—
card each proof whose genotypes are a subset of another proof.
Among the remaining proofs, we retain only those whose upper
bound and lower bound are both 1, i.e. each of them matches
exactly one case. The resulting proofs are used to identify cases from
candidates. Specifically, if exactly one candidate matches one such
proof, we output this candidate as a case in the GWAS. The follow—
ing theorem ensures that the result of our attack contains no false
positive, under the condition that adversary’s candidate set contains
all the cases (i.e. closed world assumption). The proof of the the—
orem is provided in the support online documents.

Theorem 1: Under closed world assumption, if the proof ,0
satisfies lp : 1 and there is only one matching individual in the
target set, then this individual must he a case in the GWAS.

Under open world assumption, our approach could falsely
report candidates in D as patients in Dc. However, our discussion
in supporting online documents shows that the lengths of the
proofs are usually sufficiently long. This forbids the output of false—
positive candidates with high probability, as these candidates need to
match a true patient not included in D on a large number of genotypes.

Although Algorithm 2 is capable of generating all presence
proofs, its computational costs might be too high for a GWAS
that publishes a large number of genotypes, due to the exponential

number of possible combinations. In the following, we present
an optimized algorithm (which we call candidate matching) that
only generates necessary presence proofs for a given candidate set,
rather than enumerates all proofs.

Candidate matching is accomplished by building an appropriate
first layer £2 (originally done on the first line of Algorithm 2),
based on the target candidate sample x, as Formula 5. The rest of
the algorithm runs in exactly the same way as Algorithm 2 does.

£2 = {(1, {13 k}. {xm warn M?!“ v Mil/“ii (5)

To reduce the computational cost, the candidate matching
method finds discriminative genotypes before the generation of pres—
ence proofs. As the frequency of proofs on the samples is mostly
dependent on the co—occurrence counts of the genotypes, we run the
genotype selection based on the heuristic that a genotype is more
discriminative if the numbers of co—occurrence of the genotype to—
gether with other genotypes are consistently smaller. This brings us
a simple minimal mutual co—occurrences genotype selection strategy
working as follows. First, we calculate the genotype co—occurrence
for each genotype in the candidate. If it is a major genotype,

we have h,- : Zlikid‘kgl-(M/Qko + M221), otherwise, we have
[a]. : Zlgkgd.k#(M/IE + M11121). The algorithm returns genotypes
with minimal h; and feeds these genotypes to the proof generation
procedure.

3 Results and discussions

To evaluate the effectiveness of the privacy attack, we test it on eight
datasets from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium
(WTCCC). All DNA samples in these datasets are collected using the
500K Affymetrix chip, and each sample contains genome sequence on
394 747 loci. In Table 1, we list the abbreviation, the target disease
and the number of cases in each dataset. We simulate seven different
GWASs by using the NBS dataset as the controls and one of the seven
other datasets as the cases. The reference population is the set of indi—
viduals that appear in any of the eight datasets. In each simulated
GWAS, we pick a certain number of genotypes uniformly at random
and publish the P values of their genotype—disease correlations and
the correlations between each pair of these genotypes. By default,
each published value has a precision of 0.001, and different levels of
precision are tested.

For computational efficiency, we select a subset of the published
loci with minimal mutual co—occurrences and run the privacy attack
on this subset. To evaluate the accuracy of the attack, we iteratively
consider each member of the reference population as a suspect.
We label the suspect as a positive result if at least one presence proof
is found in the DNA of the suspect, but nowhere else in the reference
population. Otherwise the result is negative, meaning that the sus—
pect is not re—identified as being among the cases. Intuitively, the
attack is effective if it returns positive results for the cases and
negative answers for other members of the reference population.
We repeat the GWAS simulation and attack for 10 different
randomly selected sets of published genotypes for each dataset and
report the average results. Table 2 summarizes the parameters inves—
tigated in the experiments.

Figure 3 shows that on average, the attack successfully
re—identifies 15 cases when 75 genotypes are involved in the GWAS
results, of which just 14 are exploited in the attack. In other words,
14 genotypes out of 75 suffice to find unique patterns in 1% of
the cases, patterns that distinguish them from everyone else in the

reference population. Just as importantly, the attack does not
falsely re—identify anyone from the reference population. In the
Supplementary Document, we prove that when the reference dataset
includes all cases, then the attack will not incur any false positive.
We also show that when this assumption does not hold, e.g. some
of the cases are not in the reference dataset, false positives are theor—
etically possible, but unlikely.

Figure 3 also shows that the number of re—identified cases
grows rapidly as the number of published genotypes increases. This is
important because today’s GWAS studies already typically report
more than 100 loci in the publication (Sladek et al., 2007; Zeggini
et al., 2007), which would tend to boost the re—identification rate sig—
nificantly. Meanwhile, when the number of published genotypes is
fixed, the number of re—identified cases increases with the number of
loci used in the attack, at the expense of computation time. In add—
ition, Figure 3 also contains results with varying levels of precision for
each published value in the GWAS results. As long as the precision re—
mains above 0.001, the number of re—identified cases tends to be sta—
ble; in contrast, when the precision level falls below 0.01, the attack
is unable to re—identify any case.

To simulate a real attack, we also test the effectiveness of our at—
tack on the WTCCC dataset with the genotypes published by Scott
et al. (2007). Because of the different source of the DNA data em—
ployed by Scott et al., only 36 out of the 306 genotypes discussed in
their article are available in the WTCCC datasets. We therefore
apply our attack to these 36 genotypes, using the T2D dataset as
cases, NBS as controls, and the other six datasets as the reference
population. As shown in Figure 4, the attack determines that 12 peo—
ple from the WTCCC datasets are among the T2D cases, using 14
genotypes that the attack selected from among the 36 available.
The attack does not mistakenly re—identify anyone from the
reference population as being among the cases. The number of
re—identifications is only slightly lower than that achieved with twice
as many randomly selected genotypes in Figure 3, further confirming
the effectiveness of the attack.

Note that the above results are based on dominant/recessive cod—
ing of the genotypes. When there are a lot rare variants, our method
can also be extended to the additive model. Let M and M denote the
co—occurrence matrices on the recessive model (binary coding, 0 for

4 Conclusion

To sum up, the privacy attack described in this article poses a poten—
tial threat to the privacy of patients participating in a GWAS. One ef—
fective countermeasure is to lower the precision of the published
statistics, e.g. publish only a heat map for the correlation between dif—
ferent genotypes and never reveal their precise values. Meanwhile,
since the attack’s power grows with the number of genotypes, studies
should minimize the number of SNPs included in the published re—
sults. Finally, a promising direction for protecting GWAS results with
strong privacy guarantees is differential privacy techniques (Johnson
and Shmatikov, 2013), which inject random noise into the statistical
results. The current state—of—the—art is able to publish a handful of
genotypes with the highest correlations with the disease with strong
privacy guarantees and good accuracy. However, some limitations of
the method need to be addressed in the future, e.g. the method is only
applicable to binary coding of the genotypes, the method incurs pro—
hibitively high error rates when a larger number of genotypes are
involved in the published results.

With the availability of direct—to—consumer genetic tests that re—
port genotypes associated with medical or physical traits, personal
genetic marker data are becoming widely accessible and even
public. Medical institutions are considering collecting prospective
genomic data on patients in large scale for both research and poten—
tially clinical purposes. It is therefore important for effective security
measures to be in place as these data become accessible. We present
the first successful attack algorithm using minimum genotype sets
and several effective counter measures. This strategy represents a
framework for future genetic privacy defenses.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Large-scale phenotyping projects such as the Sanger
Mouse Genetics project are ongoing efforts to help identify the influ-
ences of genes and their modification on phenotypes. Gene—pheno-
type relations are crucial to the improvement of our understanding of
human heritable diseases as well as the development of drugs.
However, given that there are ~20 000 genes in higher vertebrate gen-
omes and the experimental verification of gene—phenotype relations
requires a lot of resources, methods are needed that determine good
candidates for testing.

Results: In this study, we applied an association rule mining approach
to the identification of promising secondary phenotype candidates.
The predictions rely on a large gene—phenotype annotation set
that is used to find occurrence patterns of phenotypes. Applying
an association rule mining approach, we could identify 1967
secondary phenotype hypotheses that cover 244 genes and 136
phenotypes. Using two automated and one manual evaluation
strategies, we demonstrate that the secondary phenotype candidates
possess biological relevance to the genes they are predicted for. From
the results we conclude that the predicted secondary phenotypes
constitute good candidates to be experimentally tested and
confirmed.

1 INTRODUCTION

A causative gene has not yet been identiﬁed for almost half of the
existing human heritable diseases (Schoﬁeld et al., 2012).
Without the knowledge of the molecular basis of a disease, treat-
ment possibilities are limited to treating symptoms instead of
curing the underlying defects. In order to be able to ﬁnd cures
and prevention mechanisms for human genetic disorders, we
need to comprehensively understand how each disease originates
and progresses over time. A collection of human diseases to-
gether with conﬁrmed and speculative causes is available from
resources such as the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(OMIM) (Amberger et al., 2011) or Orphanet (Aymé, 2003)
database.

In the quest for identifying causative genes for human genetic
disorders, model organisms have gained increasing importance
due to the opportunities arising from targeted gene

modiﬁcations. For example, the mouse shares 99% of genes
with humans, and gene modiﬁcations leading to phenotypes
characteristic for a disease may offer clues to the origins of this
disease (Rosenthal and Brown, 2007). Experimental results of
mutagenesis experiments are stored in species-speciﬁc Model
Organism Database (MOD)s (Leonelli and Ankeny, 2012), e.g.
the Sanger Mouse Genetics Project (Sanger-MGP) (White et al.,
2013), WormBase Hook et al., 2012), the Mouse Genome
Database (MGD) (Bult et al., 2012) or FlyBase (Drysdale and
FlyBase Consortium, 2008).

The Sanger-MGP is part of the International Mouse
Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) project that aims to identify
the phenotypic implications of 20 000 genes by 2021 (Brown and
Moore, 2012). In the framework of this project genetically mod-
iﬁed mouse models are assessed according to 20 pre-defined
standard operating procedures (SOPs) that are linked to meas-
urable physical parameters to ascertain the implications of gen-
etic mutations on phenotypes (Mallon et al., 2012). An example
of a SOP is the assessment of the grip strength of mice at the age
of 9 weeks to assess their neuromuscular function as muscle
strength (https://www.mousephenotype.org/impress/protocol/
83/7). Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP) (Smith and
Eppig, 2009) annotations are assigned using a reference range
method followed by an expert review. Later studies explore the
application of other statistical methods to assign MP phenotype
annotations based on the obtained parameter readings
(Beck et al., 2009; Karp et al., 2012a), however, these
methods only cover a subset of the phenotypes covered by the
20 SOPs.

The process of assessing physical measurements in accordance
with the 20 pre—deﬁned SOPs is referred to as primary phenotyp-
ing (Justice, 2008). According to the European Mouse Disease
Clinic (EUMODIC) web page (http://www.eumodic.org/) “A
distributed network of centres with in depth expertise in a
number of phenotyping domains will undertake more complex, sec-
ondary phenotyping screens and apply them to a subset of the mice
which have shown interesting phenotypes in the primary screen.”.
However, with the increasing amount of genes being assessed in
the primary phenotyping screen, a manual investigation for inter-
esting results from the primary screens becomes impossible. In
addition, the manual assessment of experimental results is time
consuming, expensive and requires trained biologists. Therefore,
automated methods enabling the search for promising secondary
phenotypes are needed to complement the results obtained from
the primary screens.

Existing automated solutions include the prediction of pheno-
types based on orthologous genes (Groth et al., 2007; MCGary
et al., 2010) as well as functional annotations of genes

Automatically generating secondary phenotyping hypotheses

 

(King et al., 2003). However, orthologous genes do not necessar-
ily exhibit the same function or expression patterns across differ-
ent species and therefore, do not always provide reliable answers.
A solution relying only on existing phenotype annotations could
overcome the problem in differing gene function and resulting
phenotypes across different species. To the best of our know-
ledge, the prediction of secondary phenotypes from primary
screen annotations in combination with literature-curated pheno-
types in mouse has not been addressed before.

Here, we present an association rule mining approach that
enables the identification of potential secondary phenotype
screens in mouse using data from MGD, and complementing
the primary phenotype screens in Sanger-MGP. Applying asso-
ciation rule mining, we were able to discover 188 rules, covering
242 phenotypes and leading to 1967 predictions for secondary
phenotypes for 244 genes contained in the Sanger-MGP data-
base. These 1967 suggested geneephenotype associations include
136 unique phenotypes for which new assays can be deﬁned for.
The predicted associations are neither contained in MGD nor
Sanger-MGP. We automatically as well as manually evaluated
the secondary phenotype predictions and can demonstrate that
our results show viable candidates. In conclusion, we believe that
novel biological hypotheses and secondary phenotype screens
can be formulated from the predicted secondary phenotypes.

2 METHODS

Figure 1 illustrates the overall workﬂow of this study. The following
subsections describe the prediction approach and the utilized datasets
in detail.

2.1 Prediction of secondary phenotype candidates for
mouse genes

To determine candidates for secondary phenotyping, we ﬁrst analysed
MGD’s phenotype annotations for mouse mutants. We hypothesized
that phenotypes that signiﬁcantly co-occur with each other more often
than expected by chance, given the overall amount of phenotype anno-
tations, constitute good candidates for the secondary phenotype

Fig. 1. Overall workﬂow of the study. After determining-related pheno-
types, the primary phenotype annotations assigned to genes in Sanger-
MGP are enriched with potentially related phenotypes. The additional,
predicted secondary phenotypes are evaluated in several steps

experiments. For example, it is known that body weight correlates with
bone density or grip strength and changes in body weight often lead to
changes in the correlated phenotypes (Karp et al., 2012a, b; Valdar et al.,
2006). Using a large dataset of phenotype annotations, we can determine
pairs of phenotypes that may be biologically linked.

Association rule mining was originally used to ﬁnd patterns of items
that are frequently purchased together in one transaction in a supermar-
ket. Each association rule assigns a probability to an implication based on
the dataset, e. g. how likely is it that someone who bought bread and milk
also purchased butter. In the Bioinforrnatics domain, association rule
mining has been previously successfully applied to large annotation sets
with the aim to ﬁnd relationships between gene functions described with
Gene Ontology (GO) (Botstein et al., 2000; Kumar et al., 2004; Manda
et al., 2012). As the goal of determining signiﬁcantly co-occurring con-
cepts to deﬁne relationships is the same here, association rule mining can
also be applied. We used the apriori (http://www.borgelt.net/doc/apriori/
apriori.html) software implementation (Agrawal et al., 1996; Borgelt,
2003) with the following parameter settings:

—tr —s—6 —m2 —n2 —c90 —ep —v ‘ ‘%e’ ’

with -tr to enforce the output of association rules instead of item sets, -s-6
to obtain only rules that are supported by at least six item sets, -m2 to
include only rules with a minimum of two items, -n2 to include only rules
with a maximum of two items, -c90 to only allow rules with a conﬁdence
of 90%, -ep to provide P-values for each rule and -v “%e” to add the
P-value separated by space to each of the rules. The input to the apriori
software was the set of literature-curated phenotype annotations of
mouse genes and the output of rules of the type phenotype_1 —> pheno-
type_2. As a starting point, we limited the output to rules including only
two phenotypes to avoid complex dependencies between the annotations.
However, in future work we aim to extend the approach to address more
complex dependencies between phenotypes.

The two parameters that are used to narrow down the associations’
rules to obtain meaningful, biologically related phenotypes, are support
and conﬁdence. We set the support for association rules to six which
means that a minimum of six genes have to be annotated with both
phenotype_1 and phenotype_2. The conﬁdence corresponds to the ratio
of genes being annotated with phenotype_1 as well as phenotype_2 over
the genes that are only annotated with phenotype_1. In our case, at least
90% of the genes annotated with phenotype_1 must have also pheno-
type_2 as annotation in order for this rule to be reported. Changing
either parameter may lead to the report of different association rules in
the output. We considered this to be conservative settings for an initial
study, and the determination of the ideal settings for both parameters is
subject to future work.

Rules are returned together with their corresponding P-value to enable
potential further ﬁltering and user conﬁdence, e.g.

MP:0004725<— MP20009448O
MP:OOO5606<— MP200094483.9905e—212
MP:OOO5606<— MP:OOO95574.22726e—l82
MP: 0000245<— MP: 00111712 . 645l8e—125

All extracted rules are then sorted according to the phenotypes includ-
ing them, i.e. one phenotype may potentially be associated with more
than one secondary phenotype candidate. As shown by the rules given
before as an example, a decreased platelet ATP level phenotype
(MP:0009448) would be associated with an increased bleeding time
phenotypes (MP:0005606) and a decreased platelet serotonin level
(MP:0004725). Following this procedure will lead to a list of mapped
phenotypes including the phenotypes from the high-throughput assess-
ment in the primary phenotype screening deﬁned in the SOPs. Therefore,
the mapped phenotypes are then filtered to exclude the phenotypes cov-
ered by the Sanger-MGP SOPs. Because of this ﬁltering, we obtain only

predictions for secondary phenotypes that have not been included in the
primary screens.

For all the genes contained in Sanger-MGP, we then generated a list of
secondary phenotype annotation predictions by going through all the
existing phenotype annotations for a gene and adding those phenotypes
that have been mapped based on co-occurrence. Then we removed all
genephenotype associations that have been identiﬁed already and are
contained in either MGD or Sanger-MGP to only generate potentially
novel links between genes and phenotypes. We refer to the remaining
phenotype annotations as predicted secondary phenotypes.

We chose the MGD phenotype annotations for gene knockouts as
basis for our predictions and downloaded the report ﬁle on July 20,
2013. The downloaded ﬁle comprised 126 522 MP annotations for 9447
genes, covering 7393 unique MP concepts. The Sanger-MGP covers 20
SOPs that correspond to 367 MP annotations. Deducting the 367 MP
that are covered by the SOPs from the unique number of MP concepts in
MGD, provides the target phenotype annotation space. This means that
7027 unique phenotype concepts can be potentially associated with any of
the 725 genes that had been assessed by the primary screens in the Sanger-
MGP at the time this study was conducted. All the phenotype annotation
datasets were applied without conducting a taxonomic closure on the
annotations. However, once the secondary phenotypes have been pre-
dicted, corresponding assays would have to be determined to test the
generated phenotype hypotheses.

2.2 Evaluation of secondary phenotype predictions

We evaluated the secondary phenotype predictions automatically as well
as manually. The automated evaluation was realized by applying the
secondary phenotype candidates in two use cases for phenotype annota-
tions: the clustering of genes according to phenotypes leading to clusters
of gene function, and the prediction of disease gene candidates by com-
paring disease phenotypes with phenotypes that have been determined to
be affected by a gene mutation. In both use cases, we applied ﬁrst pheno-
type annotations determined during the primary screens, and after that a
combination of the primary screen annotations together with the predic-
tions for secondary phenotypes. We assume that if the performance im-
proves when adding the secondary phenotype predictions, the secondary
phenotypes possess biological validity. In addition, we manually investi-
gated ﬁve diseases further where the predictability of at least one known
causative gene improved. More information about the evaluation of the
secondary phenotypes is provided in the following subsections.

2.2.] Automated evaluation based on gene function In previous
studies, it has been demonstrated that phenotype annotations can be
used to determine biologically meaningful clusters with respect to gene
function and protein interactions (van Driel et al., 2006). Oti et al. ex-
tended the method to validate the content of three human phenotype
databases with respect to consistency and completeness. We assume
that the secondary phenotype predictions once added to the annotations
assigned in the primary screens improve consistency and completeness of
the phenotype data. Therefore, we applied the method introduced by Oti
et al. relying on the biological coherence of gene clusters built on pheno-
type similarity. The biological coherence is calculated based on the over-
lap of GO annotations among all the genes falling into one cluster.

To assess the biological coherence without and with the predicted sec-
ondary phenotypes, we generated gene clusters based on the primary
phenotypes solely, as well as clusters based on the primary and secondary
phenotype data in conjunction. Before the actual clustering step, we per-
formed a taxonomic closure based on MP, which means that all super-
classes for each assigned phenotype annotation were added to a gene’s
phenotype annotation set. Clusters were formed based on the phenotype
similarities, and the similarity between pairs of genes based on their
phenotype annotations using a Jaccard coefficient (the ratio of shared
phenotypes over the unique set of phenotypes assigned to both the genes).

Genes were clustered with respect to their phenotype similarity using
average linkage clustering. Clusters were determined by applying the
Dynamic Treecut package in R (Langfelder et al., 2008) to the obtained
dendrogram. We set the parameters of the Dynamic Treecut package to
require a minimum of two genes falling into one cluster. For each of the
determined cluster, the biological coherence was calculated with

c2=§jcuuvn, (u
131'

where C(i,j) is the term overlap between gene i and gene j, and n is the
number of genes in this cluster. The overall biological coherence score for
all clusters is obtained by averaging the individual scores for the clusters:

q=iqm, @
i=1

where m is the number of clusters formed for a particular dataset.

In compliance with the method described in (Oti et al., 2009), the
datasets are not directly compared, instead they are compared to rando-
mized datasets to correct for gene annotation biases. For this purpose, we
randomized each of the two phenotype annotation setsiprimary and
secondaryimaintaining the number and uniqueness of phenotype anno-
tations per gene. We randomized the original set of annotations 1000
times leading to 2002 phenotype annotation sets in total. We increased
the number of randomizations from 30 to 1000 to compensate for the fact
that Sanger-MGP contains a number of genes that are poorly
described in terms of gene function and may generate a high variation
of coherence score ratios otherwise. For each phenotype annotation set,
the ratio of the overall biological coherence C, of the respective original
phenotype annotation set (either primary or secondary) over the rando-
mized data is calculated. If this ratio is >1, the biological coherence of the
original dataset is greater than the randomization data; vice versa for
scores in the range [0,1], the biological coherence for the randomized
data exceeds the coherence of the respective original dataset. The ratio
scores are then summarized in box plots and the difference between all the
ratios of both datasets is calculated with a non-parametric, two-sided
Wilcoxon rank-sum test implemented in R. Figure 2 illustrates this evalu-
ation step.

We assessed gene cluster coherence based on functional annotations of
mouse genes. For this purpose, we downloaded the GO annotations of

mouse genes from the MGD database on July 12, 2013 (ftp://ftp.inforrn
atics.jax.org/pub/reports/gene_association.mgi). The dataset comprised
annotations for 25 499 MGD marker accession identiﬁers with 13 551
unique GO concepts, with an average of 11.64 GO annotations per
gene. Using the original Sanger-MGP dataset with primary annotations
only, we obtain 33 clusters for the 480 genes investigated that are then
assessed for the biological coherence based on their gene function
annotations.

2.2.2 Automated evaluation based on disease gene candidate
predictions Among other tools for disease gene candidate prediction,
PhenoDigm uses phenotype annotations to predict gene candidates
underlying a disease (Smedley et al., 2013). Disease gene candidates are
predicted based on the primary phenotype annotations assigned to mouse
and zebraﬁsh models and their phenotypic similarity to human genetic
disorders described in OMIM (http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.
org/contao/index.php/downloadshtml). The better the overlap of pheno-
types between a model and a disease, the higher the corresponding knock-
out gene is ranked for this disease.

To assess the performance of a ranking algorithm, commonly Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are used that are calculated based
on a benchmark dataset. In our case, we used known genedisease asso-
ciations to assess the value of the predictions. If the secondary phenotypes
add value to the predictions, then a performance increase should be vis-
ible from the Area Under Curve (AUC) of the two ROC curves (one for
the predictions based on primary phenotype data, and one for the pre-
dictions based on primary and secondary phenotype data). To test
whether the increase in the AUC is significant, we used a two-sided test
for ROC curves available online (http://vassarstats.net/roc_comp.html;
Hanley and McNeil, 1982).

Using PhenoDigm as an automated evaluation algorithm of the sec-
ondary phenotype predictions required a benchmark set of known gene
disease associations. If the secondary phenotype annotations improve the
phenotypic overlap of genes and diseases, the ROC curves used for the
evaluation should show an improvement. To generate the ROC curves,
we used the gene—disease associations contained in OMIM’s MorbidMap
ﬁle (http://omim.org/downloads), which was downloaded on July 20,
2013. This dataset comprised 3781 gene—disease associations, including
2530 genes and 3158 diseases.

2.2.3 Manual evaluation To evaluate some of the secondary pheno-
type predictions, we manually investigated some of the cases were the
predictability of known disease genes improved when adding the pre-
dicted secondary phenotypes. We chose ﬁve genedisease associations
where the gene improved with respect to its rank for the disease and
looked based on which annotations the match between disease and
gene could be made. The information concerning the matched phenotype
annotations of a disease and a gene is contained in Supplementary
Material S].

2.3 Implementation of PhenoDigm extension to provide
secondary phenotype predictions online

To enable access to the predicted secondary phenotypes, we imple-
mented an extension to our online tool PhenoDigm (Smedley et al.,
2013) that predicts causative genes for human heritable disorders.
The extension is, as well as the original tool, implemented using the
Play! Framework (http://www.playframework.com/) (version 1.2.5),
jQuery (http://jquery.com/) (version 1.6.4) and jQuery UI (http://jquer
yui.com/) (version 1.9.1). The secondary phenotype predictions were
imported into PhenoDigrn’s underlying MySQL database (http://www.
mysql.com/) by extending the database schema. However, secondary
phenotype predictions are not incorporated into PhenoDigrn’s disease
gene candidate predictions available from the web page, unless

experimentally conﬁrmed and integrated into one of the phenotype an-
notation databases.

3 RESULTS

Applying association rule mining, we were able to identify 188
rules (provided in Supplementary Material S1) that lead to sec-
ondary phenotype hypotheses for 244 Sanger-MGP genes. In
total, we could predict 1967 novel geneephenotype associations
containing 136 unique phenotypes that are not contained in
MGD. Out of these 1967 geneephenotype relationships, 47
were covered by the taxonomy of the ontology, i.e. the predicted
phenotypes were ancestor concepts of annotations already used
for one particular gene. The 136 unique phenotype concepts span
23 of MGD’s 30 top level phenotypes, such as tumorigenesis
(MP:0002006), nervous system phenotype (MP:0003631) or
muscle phenotype (MP:0005369), showing the diversity of pheno-
types that could be added to the annotation of genes. The 136
phenotypes also cover different hierarchy levels in the ontology
spanning from the second to the 11th level, with the highest
group falling into level 6 (all measured as shortest distance
from the root node of the MP ontology). For example, adeno-
hypophysis hypoplasia (MP:0008365) as well as abnormal cranium
size (MP:0010031) are suggested as secondary phenotypes. In
general, the deeper an ontology term is the more speciﬁc is the
concept it is representing. This means that the predictions not
only span a variety of different high level phenotypes but also
add detailed information to the genes they are associated with
which allows for a better characterization of individual genes.
Supplementary Material S1 provides all the predicted secondary
phenotype annotations together with additional information
such as the high level phenotype, term name and frequency of
occurrence in the prediction dataset.

3.1 Predicted secondary phenotypes signiﬁcantly improve
the biological coherence of gene clusters

In recent studies, phenotypes have successfully been applied
to determine disease gene candidates and gene function
(Smedley et al., 2013; van Driel et al., 2006). In order to asses
the validity and quality of the predicted secondary phenotype
annotations, we assessed the biological coherence of gene clus-
ters, built based on phenotype similarity between genes.
Applying the method described by Oti et al. first to the primary
phenotype annotations only, and then to both primary and
predicted secondary phenotype annotations, shows that the bio-
logical coherence of clusters increases when adding the predicted
secondary phenotype annotations. The obtained results are de-
picted in Figure 3.

In addition to calculating the biological coherence for both
datasets, we determined the signiﬁcance of the fold-increase of
the coherence of the clusters. Using a two-sided Wilcoxon
signed-rank test (as implemented in R, a = 0.05), we obtained
a P—value of 2.2x 10‘”, indicating a significant improvement
when adding secondary phenotype annotations to the previously
conﬁrmed in the primary phenotype scans. These results suggest
that the predicted secondary phenotypes possess biological val-
idity but will have to be experimentally veriﬁed in secondary
phenotype screens.

3.2 Secondary phenotypes signiﬁcantly improve the
predictability of disease gene candidates

In addition to assessing the biological coherence of gene clusters,
we also veriﬁed the predicted secondary phenotype annotations
by applying them in a second application use case: the prediction
of disease gene candidates. One tool that already uses the pri-
mary phenotype data of genes to predict disease gene candidates
is PhenoDigm (Smedley et al., 2013). To assess whether the sec-
ondary phenotypes possess biological validity, we ﬁrst used only
the primary annotations to predict disease gene candidates and
then added the secondary phenotype annotations. For both pre-
dictions, we calculated the ROC curves, using geneedisease as-
sociations contained in MGD as benchmark dataset. Both the
obtained ROC curves are depicted in Figure 4. Applying a one-
tailed Student’s t-test (a = 0.05) to the ROC curves, we obtain a
P—value of P = 0.02.

3.3 The C0q9 mouse improves as a model for primary
coenzyme Q10 deﬁciency 5

To further assess the value added by the predicted secondary
phenotypes, we manually assessed diseases that show rank im-
provements for known causative genes. We determined the
number and particular phenotypes that could be matched be-
tween models and diseases, where causative genes improved in
the ranking as disease candidates. In the best case, the gene Coq9
(MGI:1915164) that has been recognized as a being disrupted in
cases of Primary coenzyme Q10 defiency 5 (COQ10D5;
MIM:#614654) improves from rank 181 to rank 2 based on
the secondary phenotype annotations. Using the annotations as-
signed in the primary screens, only one pair of matching

phenotypes can be determined: Hyperreflexia (HP:0001347)
and hyperactivity (MP:0001399). Applying in addition the pre-
dicted secondary phenotypes, other signs and symptoms of this
disease, such as Postnatal microcephaly (HP:0005484) and Left
ventricular hypertrophy (HP:0001712), are detected.

Another example for gene rank improvement is that the th
(MGI:88385) gene was ranked in second place after adding the
predicted secondary phenotypes (rank 43 when using only pri-
mary phenotypes) for Complement factor H deficiency
(MIM:#609814). Including the predicted secondary phenotypes
allows for a coverage of the following additional phenotypes:
Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (HP:0004722),
Progressive renal insuﬂiciency (HP:0000106) and Hematuria
(HP:0000790). Interestingly, the th gene is not only associated
with Complement factor H deficiency but also with Atypical
hemolytic uremic syndrome 1 (MIM:#235400), and adding the
secondary phenotype information, the gene also obtained an im-
proved rank for this disease (rank 177 with primary phenotypes
only and rank 41 with inserting secondary phenotype informa-
tion). From the improvement in both cases, we conjecture that
the secondary phenotypes cover correct functional aspects of the
gene that could not have been identiﬁed with the primary pheno-
type screens.

This information together with additional information for an-
other three diseases and their respective genes is provided in
Supplementary Material S1.

3.4 Browsing the secondary phenotype predictions online

To provide access to the secondary phenotype predictions,
we implemented an extension to our disease gene candidate
prediction tool PhenoDigm (Smedley et al., 2013). The results
can be browsed at http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/databases/
phenodigm/. The web interface provides all the genes that pos-
sess secondary phenotype candidates as a list and the user can

select individual genes for further investigation. Upon selecting a
gene, the user is provided with all the details available for this
gene, i.e. diseases the gene has been confirmed to be a cause for,
phenotype annotations from the primary screens, the literature-
curated annotations from MGD and the suggested phenotypes
for secondary screens. Providing this information together, a
biologist or clinician could easily assess whether the secondary
phenotype candidates are worthwhile to be tested in a biological
experiment. Figure 5 provides a snapshot of the available gene-
centric information through PhenoDigm’s web interface.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we applied an association rule mining approach to
mine secondary phenotypes and computationally verify their bio-
logical validity using two automated and a limited manual evalu-
ation. We used the manually assigned phenotype annotations
contained in MGD for learning phenotype co-occurrence pat-
terns and merged the identiﬁed patterns with phenotypes that
were experimentally verified in primary screens and are available
from the Sanger-MGP (White et al., 2013).

Using data from particular resources creates dependencies to-
wards those data resources. For example, annotation guidelines
such as those employed by MGD ensure a consistency of human
annotators but can also create artefacts in the predictions gener-
ated from the data. In our particular case, we may ﬁnd pheno-
type co-occurrence patterns that are intrinsic to annotation
guidelines and not purely due to their co-occurrence. This may
occur when the annotation guidelines cover rules that enforce a
set of phenotypes to be annotated in particular circumstances
instead of only one. However, as these guidelines exist to

all: : I .-: l- l‘Fliv

ensure biological correctness of the data, we expect that those
cases still constitute biologically interesting, though known con-
nections between individual phenotypes.

The implementation of the secondary phenotype prediction
pipeline relies solely on an association rule mining approach.
Using the pipeline in conjunction with 7027 unique phenotypes
(see Section 2.1), the obtained result of 188 new rules seems
comparatively small. As the number of rules is directly related
to the settings for the apriori software, the number of potential
hypotheses may be increased by changing these parameters.
However, and as with any prediction tool, we applied conserva-
tive measures that would reduce the likelihood of creating false
hypotheses. In addition, starting with a small subset of rules
enables better veriﬁcation possibilities and selection mechanisms
for biological experiment design. Potential areas of extension are
the incorporation of additional pattern recognition methods that
could then be used to form a support system and provide prov-
enance for identiﬁed patterns, e. g. only predictions that are made
by a number of systems are more likely to be secondary
phenotypes.

Using phenotype patterns to generate secondary phenotype
predictions implies that phenotypes that co-occur often with
each other, are likely to always co-occur. For some biological
phenomena this assumption has been validated, e.g. the correl-
ation of body weight with bone density or blood calcium levels
(Karp et al., 2012b). Given that the secondary phenotypes per-
form well in the evaluation, we feel that the assumption can still
be used for forming secondary phenotype hypotheses. However,
in future work we envisage a more complex filtering strategy for
assigning phenotype annotations using not only primary pheno-
types, but also gene function annotations and disease

involvement to reduce the number of falsely associated genes and
phenotypes in addition to voting from different prediction
algorithms.

4.1 Predicted secondary phenotypes improve the biological
coherence of the clusters

Using automated evaluation procedures that apply predictions in
biological use cases may mask-speciﬁc problems that can only be
spotted by human curators, e. g. if it is known that one particular
gene does not cause a particular phenotype in particular circum-
stances. However, the methods can provide a summarized judge-
ment over all the results instead of providing details for all cases.
As demonstrated by van Driel et al., clustering genes according
to phenotypes leads to clusters consistent with gene function and
protein interaction networks. The same evaluation mechanism
that has been applied here, had been successfully applied to assess
the quality of existing human phenome databases (Oti et al.,
2009). Using gene function annotation to determine biological
coherence is directly inﬂuenced by the number of annotations
available.

4.2 Secondary phenotypes improve the predictability of
causative disease genes

In addition to the use case of gene characterization, phenotype
annotations are applied to identify the underlying mechanisms of
human heritable diseases (Hoehndorf et al., 2011; Robinson
et al., 2013; Smedley et al., 2013; Washington et al., 2009). As
the primary screens only cover 20 SOPs, the outcome of pheno-
type annotations is limited by the screens. Using the predicted
secondary phenotype annotations may highlight phenotypes of
genes that are currently limiting the predictability of certain dis-
eases or groups of diseases. Our results show that adding the
secondary phenotype annotations improve the predictability of
disease genes and the characterization of genes on a phenotype
level can be improved with the suggested phenotypes. However,
experimental veriﬁcation is necessary and assays would have to
be incorporated to test for the 137 identiﬁed phenotypes.

4.3 Secondary phenotypes further characterize genes
assessed with primary phenotyping

As illustrated with a small subset of selected diseases, adding the
predicted secondary phenotypes leads to an increase of matched
phenotypes between diseases and models. As discussed before,
these results indicate that the predictions indeed possess biolo-
gical validity and constitute good biological hypotheses to guide
the design of experimental setups for secondary screens. The se-
lection of diseases, however, was limited to the cases where an
improvement for the causative gene happened. In future work,
we will also have to extend our analysis to genes where no im-
provement or rank decrease was experienced. However, we note
here that the rank changes of known causative disease genes are
only indicators for performance changes and need manual inves-
tigation. Some of the OMIM diseases may possess multiple
causative genes, some of which have not yet been discovered
or listed in OMIM. As a consequence, those genes will be recog-
nized as false positives during the evaluation. If one of the causa-
tive genes that have not been listed in OMIM improves

tremendously over those genes that are listed, we could obtain
a rank decrease for genes that are listed in OMIM.

4.4 Future development of the PhenoDigm extension

The data have been made available through a web interface that
provides a gene-centric view on the data. All the predictions can
be assessed and are provided in the context of diseases and in-
formation about the primary phenotype screens for easy veriﬁ-
cation and hypothesis derivation. As more data become
available, e.g. through additional automated, statistical screens
such as suggested by Karp et al., further information can be
included such as effect size and additional phenotype
annotations.

Furthermore, even though the annotations have been vali-
dated using the predicted secondary phenotype annotations in
PhenoDigm’s disease prediction algorithm, the disease gene can-
didate predictions based on the secondary phenotype data are
not yet available. A possible extension of the web interface in
future work could be the inclusion of these predictions. If the
predictions are included, possible new emerging disease groups
relevant for a gene could be easily spotted from the list and guide
new experiments.

5 CONCLUSION

Here, we presented a method to predict secondary phenotype
candidates based on existing large-scale phenotype annotation
sources and primary screens for genes. We verified the secondary
phenotype candidates by applying it in two use cases and could
demonstrate that the predictions add value in either use case and,
therefore, seem biologically relevant to the genes they are pre-
dicted for. We could show that the phenotype candidates not
only increase the biological coherence of gene clusters, but also
improve the candidate prediction of genes for human heritable
diseases. In conclusion, we provide a set of geneephenotype as-
sociations that can be further assessed in biological experiments
and guide the experimental design to further investigate speciﬁc
genes or gene groups. All the data are freely available online
from http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/databases/phenodigm/.

In future work, we aim to further improve the method by
determining the best parameter settings for the association rule
learning, but also investigate other phenotype co-occurrence pat-
tern recognition methods. One possibility is the application of a
hypergeometric distribution and find support for patterns that
have been identiﬁed with the association rule mining approach.
We further intend to provide update results through the web
interface and improve the integration with other existing
resources.

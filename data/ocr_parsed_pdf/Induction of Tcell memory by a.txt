ABSTRACT

Motivation: Although results from phase III clinical trials substantially
support the use of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against
cancer, what has yet to be defined is how many and how frequent
boosts are needed to sustain a long-lasting and protecting memory
T-cell response against tumor antigens. Common experience is that
such preclinical tests require the sacrifice of a relatively large number
of animals, and are particularly time- and money-consuming.
Results: As a first step to overcome these hurdles, we have de-
veloped an ordinary differential equation model that includes all rele-
vant entities (such as activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes and memory
T cells), and investigated the induction of immunological memory in
the context of wild-type mice injected with a dendritic cell-based vac-
cine. We have simulated the biological behavior both in the presence
and in the absence of memory T cells. Comparing results of ex vivo
and in silico experiments, we show that the model is able to envisage
the expansion and persistence of antigen -specific memory T cells. The
model might be applicable to more complex vaccination schedules
and substantially in any biological condition of prime-boosting.
Availability and implementation: The model is fully described in the
article.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the past years both therapeutic and preventive vaccines have
been developed with the aim to fight and prevent different types
of cancers (Kahn, 2009; Kantoff, 2010; Kenter et al., 2009). The
power of vaccines relies on their ability to stimulate a strong and
long-lasting antigen-speciﬁc immune response, mediated both by
B and T lymphocytes. Although induction of a protective titer of
neutralizing antibodies is the main objective of most of the vac-
cines against infectious agents, including vaccines to carcinogenic
human papillomavirus and hepatitis B Virus, which also protect
from cervical and liver cancer, respectively (Lollini et al., 2011),

evidence in humans that antibodies induced by a vaccine can
contribute to antitumor immunity is scanty (Schoenfeld et al.,
2010). Conversely, the major goal of both prophylactic and
therapeutic vaccines against non-infectious tumors, which ac-
count for ~80% of all tumors (Lollini et al., 2011), is to
induce a long-lasting antigen-speciﬁc CD8 T-cell immunity. In
support of this concept, high densities of effector memory CD8+
cytotoxic T cells are associated with a longer overall survival in
several human cancers (Fridman et al., 2012).

Usually, an effective vaccine requires multiple immunizations
in the form of prime boost. Several studies have shown that
boosting with a different vector carrying the same antigen is
better at enhancing immune responses than boosting with the
homologous vector. The mechanism underlying this phenom-
enon is still obscure. Heterologous prime-boost approaches are
now widely used in efforts to develop vaccines (Kaufmann, 2010;
Sallusto et al., 2010). It is also generally accepted that a strong
primary immune response is required to give rise to a large pool
of memory cells (Sprent and Surh, 2011). However, what affects
the longevity of memory T cells is not fully understood, and
much controversy exists regarding the role of antigens in this
process (Kaech et al., 2002; Sprent and Surh, 2011;
Zinkernagel, 2002). Sustained high amounts of soluble antigens
often lead to tolerance or exhaustion both in T and B cells. As a
result of exhaustion, antigen-speciﬁc T and B cells express a var-
iety of inhibitory receptors such as PD-l, LAG-3, CD244,
CD160, TIM-3 and CTLA-4 (Wherry, 2011).

Dendritic cell (DC)—based vaccines have been extensively
investigated as potential cancer therapeutic vaccines because of
the primary role of DCs as antigen presenting cells (APCs) and
their unique ability in T-cell priming (Banchereau and Steinman,
1998). DCs pulsed with the antigen of choice induce a potent
antigen-speciﬁc immune response and favor the generation of the
memory pool. This stems from the asymmetric division of
engaged naive T cells into effector and memory cells (Chang
et al., 2007). Several phase II clinical trials based on the use of
DCs pulsed with tumor-associated antigens are ongoing (Finn,
2008). Moreover, Sipuleucel-T (Provenge, Dendreon, Inc.), an
autologous APC-based vaccine has been the ﬁrst vaccine
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treat-
ment of cancer patients. In a phase III trial in patients affected by
castration-resistant prostate cancer, Sipuleucel-T gave a 4.1
month benefit in overall survival relative to a control arm that

Induction of T cell memory by a dendritic cell vaccine

 

received unpulsed APCs. However, no significant effects on the
time to objective disease progression were observed (Kantoff,
2010). These promising results also suggest that some fundamen-
tal biological questions remain unanswered. For DC-based vac-
cines, it is not yet known whether booster immunizations should
consist of DCs or other means. It has been reported that antigen-
bearing DCs are rapidly eliminated by antigen-speciﬁc cytotoxic
T lymphocytes (CTLs) when injected in previously vaccinated
mice (Guarda et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2006), therefore, arguing
for a reduced effectiveness of DC-based boosts. Jouanneau et a].
(2006) observed in the GL26 model that DCs are essential for the
priming, but they are less effective than tumor cell lysate alone in
boosting the antitumor immune response and for the induction
of long-term immune memory. Another unsolved issue is the
frequency of boosting. It has been reported that repeated im-
munizations result in increased frequencies of memory T cells
(Masopust et al., 2006; Wirth et al., 2010). However, overstimu—
lation can drive memory T cells toward terminal differentiation
such as activation-induced cell death, fratricide or exhaustion
(Overwijk and Restifo, 2001; Wherry, 2011).

To address these biological issues, we started analyzing the
ability of DC-based vaccines to induce a long-lasting antigen-
speciﬁc immune response in mice. As immunological readout
of antigen-primed and functional T cells, we measured the inter-
feron gamma (IFN—y) contained in sera of vaccinated mice, and
the frequency of CD8+CD44+ T cells able to release IFN—y upon
ex viva-speciﬁc antigen challenge (Camporeale et al., 2003).
Preliminary experiments suggested that to optimize the best
boosting strategy, we would have had to set many experiments
each lasting several months. To investigate these biological prob-
lems, as a ﬁrst step, we began by setting up an in silico model
capable to describe the biological phenomena observed in the
animal model. The aim of the model is to verify the memory
T-cell induction hypothesis by a DC-based vaccine observed
in vivo and to give new suggestions on the designing of boosting
strategies. During the past decades, several approaches have been
devoted to model the immune system or parts of it, with math-
ematical equation-based models representing the largest slice
among these approaches. Differential equation-based models
usually reproduce the dynamics of the average concentrations
of the immune-systemeinvolved entities over time, to obtain
the main aspects of the immune response. Simple models based
on systems of ordinary or partial differential equations can be
easily analyzed to obtain, for example, asymptotic behaviors. On
the other hand, for more complex scenarios, it is usually difﬁcult
to build complex ordinary differential equations (ODE)-based
models, as well as incorporate new aspects. The trade-off be-
tween an accurate biological representation and the mathemat-
ical feasibility may lead to biologically useless models or to
mathematically intractable models.

Cellular automata (CA) or agent-based models represent a
large class of discrete modeling techniques where each entity is
followed individually, and global behaviors are obtained from
local behaviors of all involved entities. In this way, it is possible
to model the immune system in much more detail, allowing it to
determine behavior distribution (and not just the average).
Moreover, it is easy to add and remove new entities and non-
linear interactions, to expand or update the model to the last
biological insights, leaving the problem computationally

tractable. Cellular automata and agent-based models can be suc-
cessfully used to simulate without any problems the receptor
diversity of the immune repertoire, opening the door to natural
scale simulations. An example of approaches in this direction is
discussed in (Halling-Brown et al., 2010). However, even such
approaches have their own ﬂaws. Because of the lack of a solid
mathematical theory, they miss tools allowing any asymptotic
analysis, and require considerable computational power to simu-
late individual agents, in particular for large-scale simulations.
Some good review articles that can introduce the reader to the
modeling techniques of the immune system are presented in
Germain et a]. (2011), Lundegaard et a]. (2007), and Perelson
and Weisbuch (1997).

The problem we are dealing with requires the ability to
uniquely represent the immune response of CTLs speciﬁc for
the immunodominant Tag-IV antigen from the oncovirus SV40
[Mylin et al. (1995), and also in vivo measurements refer to this].
This is a valid argument for supporting the assumption that a
monoclonal model based on ODE described in this article can be
considered adequate. The ODE model includes all the relevant
entities (such as activated CTLs and memory T cells) needed to
conﬁrm the presence of immunological memory. We simulated
the biological behavior in the presence and in the absence of
memory T cells.

2 METHODS
2.1 Model description

To model antigen-speciﬁc CTL activation and differentiation into
memory T cells on vaccination with pulsed DCs, we developed a model
based on a system of six ODEs for six different populations: pulsed
DCs (D,-) in the injection point, pulsed DCs (DP) in the presenting loca-
tions, naive CTLs (Tn), activated CTLs (Ta), memory T cells (Tm) and
IFN-y (1).

Equations (1) and (2) deal with the pulsed DCs at the injection point
and the presenting location, respectively. These two equations are used to
model the injection of pulsed DCs into the host and their consecutive
migration from the injection point to the site where presentation to CTLs
occurs (i.e. lymph nodes). D,- [Equation (1)] are injected according to the
function k,,,(t, (1) that introduces into the system (1 pulsed DCs, if, accord-
ing to the administration protocol, at time t an injection is scheduled.
D,- then migrate to presenting locations (term —or50D,-). They can also
disappear from natural death (term —or1D,-).

Equation (2) models the behavior of pulsed DCs into the presenting
location. Dp are estimated on the basis of migrating D,- (term a50D,-) and
disappear from the system for multiple causes, such as natural death
(term —or1D1,).

% = at500i — 0610p (2)
We initially considered the possibility to model the migration process
using delay differential equations, by adding in Equation (2) (term a50D,-)
a time delay of ~24 h. However, we abandoned this approach because
after some numerical simulations, we noted only negligible differences
between results obtained with and without time delay. This is probably
because such a short time delay becomes insigniﬁcant in respect to the
time-scale of the experiment (1 year).

Equation (3) models the antigen-speciﬁc naive CTLs behavior (Tn). In
general when naive CTLs are activated, they are replaced by means of
hematopoiesis to keep the naive CTLs number almost constant as speci-
ﬁed in the leukocyte formula. Of course, this does not mean that the
newborn CTLs will share the same MHC/antigen complex speciﬁcity of
previously activated cells. Present immunological knowledge cannot pre-
dict whether and when a CTL will be replaced by one of the same spe-
ciﬁcity. Moreover, cell receptors are randomly selected by DNA
recombinations. Hence, it is feasible to suppose that after a reasonable
time window, the level of antigent-speciﬁc CTLs will approach to the
same initial level. Finally, this is in line with the fact that the immunolo-
gical repertoire is almost speciﬁc for each individual.

The term h1(T,,0 — T") represents the recovery rate. Under safe condi-
tions (absence of the pathogen), the number of T cells tends to a given
value Tno. When antigenic presentation by Dp occurs, naive T cells are
activated (term —or5D1,T,,). We note here that Equation (3) takes into
account only a small portion of naive T-cell population composed by
those cells whose receptor is able to recognize the speciﬁc antigen and
not the entire T-cell population.

Activated CTLs (Ta) are modeled by Equation (4). They appear in the

system as a consequence of the antigenic presentation to T” by Dp cells

(term —or5D1,T,,) and can disappear from the system due to death

(—a3 Ta). As a consequence of activation, a small portion of activated T
cells can become memory cells (—a20 Ta).

Memory CTLs [Equation (5)] are estimated on the basis of activated T
cells (term (120 T“) and then disappear from the model because of multiple
causes, among which is natural death (—a21T,,).

The last equation [Equation (6)] describes IFN-y dynamics. The quan-
tity of IFN-y released by CTLs is taken as an outcome of the ex vivo
experiment, and it is used to estimate the number of activated T cells. To
compare our results with ex vivo observation, we modeled IFN-y dy-
namics as follows. IFN—y is released by activated and memory T cells
that are supposed to release the same quantity of IFN-y [term
h10(T,, + Tm)] and disappear from the model for natural degradation
(term —or101).

It is worth mentioning here that the capacity to endow the host with
the ability to learn through multiple encounters, and then generate
memory, is in general not representable by ODEs. This important
aspect has been analyzed using, for example, agent-based modeling
(Palladini et al., 2010; Pennisi et al., 2010). We modeled the learning
phase that arises from the multiple encounters of T cells with targets
cells by coding that into coefﬁcients that were tuned to reproduce the
fraction of memory T cells generated and observed in the mouse; the
memory is then represented as the activation of dormant pathways.

Parameter values are shown in Table 1 and have been set at reasonable
values based on results coming from the literature, from the observation
of the in vivo experiments and from our past experience (Castiglione et al.,
2012; Hailing-Brown et al., 2010; Pappalardo et al., 2006, 2009a, b, 2010,
2011, 2012; Pennisi et al., 2008, 2009).

Numerical simulations start at week 8 (t0 = 0), time of the ﬁrst injec-
tion of pulsed DCs. The time-length of the simulations has been set to 360
days. The physical time step for the simulations is A(t) = 1 day. To solve
numerically the ODE system, we used Berkeley Madonna software.

Note: q represents the number of injected pulsed DCs/ml; it was tuned with in vivo
results. a1 is the pulsed DCs death rate (half—life ~ 7 days) (Merad and Manz, 2009).
(150 is the migration rate of Di toward presentation location; it was tuned. h is the T—

the activated T—cell death rate (half—life ~2 days) (DeBoer et (1]., 2003). (120 is the
memory T—cell differentiation rate; it was tuned. (121 is the memory T—cell death rate
(half—life 8 weeks); it was tuned. hm is the IFN—y quantity released by T cells (fg/ml)
(Pennisi et (1]., 2010). am is the IFN—y degradation rate (half—life ~9 h).

Initial conditions have been set to 0 for all populations except for T”,
where Tn(0) = Tno. Because Tag-IV is an antigen speciﬁcally designed to
give rise to a strong immune response, we supposed that ~20% of the
total population of naive CTLs was potentially able to recognize the
antigen. Supposing a total population of ~400 naive CD8 T cells per
mm3, we set up Tno = 80. The differentiation rate of activated CTLs ((120)
has been tuned up in such a way that the total number of newborn
memory T cells for each injection of pulsed DCs is ~5% of the maximum
number of activated T cells for each injection. Moreover, to simulate lack
of memory, (120 has been set to 0. The parameters that we deﬁned as
‘tuned’ are free parameters, i.e. they were set to ﬁt the experimental
data. We highlight here that for these parameters there are no measures
in the literature.

It is worth noting that we used the levels and the proportions of
IFN—j/Jr cells and Kb/TagJr cells at week 9 to calibrate the model and
the same levels and proportions at week 18 to validate the model results.

2.2 LHS-PRCC sensitivity analysis

To understand which parameter may be considered fundamental in this
process, it is important to analyze the sensitivity of the model to variation
of parameters. Classical sensitivity analysis is usually done by varying a
given parameter in reasonable ranges and keeping the others constant.
Obviously, results coming from this kind of analysis are strongly bound
to the values of the fixed parameters and different sets of values for the
ﬁxed parameters may lead to completely different results.

Partial rank correlated coefﬁcients (PRCC) (Saltelli, 2004) is a statis-
tical sensitivity analysis technique that tries to overcome the limits of
classical sensitivity analysis by computing a partial correlation on rank-
transformed data between two sets of variables, represented in our case
by the model input parameters and the model entities values. The strength
of such a methodology is given by the fact that correlation does not
depend by a given set of parameters, and therefore, it is possible to esti-
mate how variations in a given parameter may inﬂuence the results of the
model, despite the value of the other parameters. Nevertheless, the meth-
odology can be, in principle, easily applied and used with any kind of
continuous or discrete model.

The methodology we used to perform sensitivity analysis (LHS-
PRCC) is brieﬂy described as follows. More information about this

methodology can be found in Marine et a]. (2008). Parameters space is
initially sampled using a Monte-Carlo technique. In this case, we use a
technique named Latin-Hypercube-Sampling (LHS) (Mckay et al., 1979).
The technique divides the random parameter distributions into N (where
N represents the chosen sample size) equal probability intervals that are
then sampled. The choice for N should be at least k+ l, where k is the
number of parameters varied, but usually much larger to ensure accuracy.
In our trials, we set N: 1000.

After sampling, a LHS matrix X of sampled parameters is built. Each
row represents a unique set of variables for the model sampled without
replacement.

The model is then solved for each row of X, and the model output
values are stored into an output matrix Y. Each matrix is then rank-
transformed (X R and YR). X and Y can be used to calculate the
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient. X R and YR can be used to calculate the
Spearman or rank correlation coefficient and the PRCC.

PRCC between an input parameter xj e X R, j 5 k and output y 6 YR
is then computed by considering the residuals xj —  and y — )3, where 
and )3 are given by the following regression models:

k k
szco+ Z cpxl, andy=b0+ Z bpxp
P=LP¢I p=Lp¢j

Using this methodology, we analyzed the effects of the most important
input parameters that most inﬂuence the behavior of the released IFN-y.
We plotted for these entities the PRCCs over the entire time course of the
experiment to see how the sensitivity of parameters changes as system
dynamics progresses, and we showed the relative PRCC scatterplots at
critical time-points. Results are available in Supplementary Data S1.

2.3 Mice and reagents

C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Italia (Calco, Italy).
Animals were treated in accordance with the European Community
guidelines and with the approval of the institutional ethical committee.
Unless speciﬁed, all chemical reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich, and
monoclonal antibodies were from BD Pharmingen.

2.4 DC preparation

DCs were prepared and characterized as previously described
(Camporeale et al., 2003). Brieﬂy, bone marrow cells were seeded into
six-well plates in ISCOVE supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and
10% fetal calf serum (Euroclone, Wetherby, UK), and the growth factors
GM-CSF (25 ng/ml) and IL-4 (Sng/ml; R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA). Eight hours before retrieval of cells, the pro-maturation
factor lipopolysaccharide (l ag/ml) was added to the culture medium.
On day 7 of the in vitra culture, non-adherent and loosely adherent
cells were collected. Culture supernatants were evaluated for mycoplasma
contamination by PCR, and positive cultures were discarded.

2.5 Immunization protocol

DCs were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline at 2 x 106/ml and
pulsed with 2p.M of the immunodominant CTL epitope Tag-IV
peptide(VVYDFLKC; Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL, USA) for
l h at 37 C, washed, resuspended in phosphate buffered saline and sub-
sequently injected intradermally (i.d.) into the right ﬂank of mice (5 x 105
DC/mouse).

2.6 Schedule of immunization

Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice were primed by i.d. injection of Tag-IV-
pulsed DCs (DC-Tag). Four weeks later the primed mice were boosted
with DC-Tag, and this process was repeated every 6 weeks for additional

two times. Animals were killed 7 days after the ﬁrst vaccination or 6
weeks after each boost.

2.7 Flow cytometry analyses

Spleens were collected and processed to single cell suspension.
Splenocytes were stained ex viva with phycoerythrin-labeled Kb/Tag-IV
pentamers (Prolmmune, Sarasota, FL, USA) in combination with the
indicated ﬂuorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies, the Dump mix-
ture of antibodies (i.e. CD4, CD19, CD110 and CDllb), the vitality
marker To-PRO3 and assessed by ﬂow cytometry. Alternatively,
cells were cultured in the absence or in the presence of 2 MM Tag-IV
peptide for 24 h, of which the last 3h were in the presence of brefeldin
A (5 ag/ml). Cells were then surface stained with ﬂuorochrome-
conjugated anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD44, anti-CD62L monoclonal
antibodies, ﬁxed and analyzed for IFN-y intracellular cytokine staining.
PMA/ionomycin was used as positive control. Dead cells were excluded
by physical parameters. IFN-yJr cells were gated on CD84r CD44+, viable
cells. Cytokine production in the absence of stimulation was considered
as background release and subtracted from values obtained by the spe-
cific peptides. In all experiments, cells were acquired on a BD
FacsCanto®.

2.8 Statistical analysis of in viva experimental studies
Prism 5.0a software was implemented to conduct statistical analysis on
data collected in ex viva immunological assays. Comparison of data
collected from the different experimental groups of mice (at least ﬁve
mice/group) was conducted using the ANOVA, and NewmanKeuls test
or the two-tailed Students t-test. Values were considered statically signiﬁ-
cant for P<0.05.

2.9 Measurements for in silica setup
To set up the in silica approach, we measured the induction and main-
tenance of an antigen-speciﬁc CTL response in C57BL/6 mice injected

with DCs pulsed with Tag-IV, the immunodominat CTL epitope from
the SV40 Tag antigen (DC-Tag) (Mylin et al., 1995).

2.10 Ethics statement

Wild-type C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Calco,
Italy) were housed in a pathogen-free animal facility and treated in ac-
cordance with the European Community guidelines. The in viva experi-
ments were approved by the ethical committee of the Istituto Scientiﬁco
San Raffaele (IACUC # 410).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 The biological experiment

Eight-week-old mice were primed with a single i.d. injection of
DC-Tag, and a ﬁrst group was sacriﬁced 1 week later (Fig. 1A).
A substantial amount of CD8+CD44+ T cells were found in the
spleen of vaccinated mice that bound Kh/Tag pentamers
(Fig. 1B), therefore, demonstrating to be antigen-experienced
and speciﬁc for Tag. Among the Tag-speciﬁc T cells, ~80%
displayed an effector phenotype (i.e. CD62L’), whereas >20%
were central memory (Fig. 1C). We investigated whether the
IFN-y measured in the sera of vaccinated mice could be used
as an indicator of the effector function of antigen-specific CD8+
T cells. The amount of IFN-y in the sera of vaccinated mice 1
week after priming was >3-fold the amount found in naive lit-
termates (56.3 :I: 10.8 versus 17.2:I:2.5pg/ml, respectively).

mimic the drop in Tag-speciﬁc T cells found by pentamer stain-
ing at week 18 (Fig. 1B and data not shown). This was likely due
to the fact that several cells of the innate and adaptive arms of

the immune system concur in producing IFN-y on vaccination.
Thus, we used an ex viva intracellular production assay to inves-
tigate the effector function of antigen-speciﬁc T cells activated by
vaccination. Interestingly, a fraction of CD8+CD44+ T cells
similar to that found with Kb pentamer staining (Fig. 1B) also
produced IFN-y on antigen-speciﬁc challenge (Fig. 1D) and spe-
ciﬁcally killed targets expressing the relevant antigen (data not
shown), therefore, conﬁrming our previously published data
(Rigamonti et al., 2011). To investigate the effects of boosts on
the dimension of the antigen-speciﬁc memory pool, mice were
boosted with DC-Tag 4 weeks later. This time schedule was
chosen based on the notion that an ideal memory CTL response
requires 4e6 weeks to settle in (Sallusto et al., 2010). In spite of
the recent vaccination, 1 week after the ﬁrst boost the percentage
(Fig. 1D) and number (Fig. 1F) of CD8+CD44+ T cells produ-
cing IFN—y substantially decreased. Mice were boosted 6 weeks
later, and the last group of mice was sacriﬁced 6 weeks after the
third boost (Fig. 1A). As expected from a memory response
measured more than a month after immunization (W irth et al.,
2010), the number of Tag-speciﬁc splenocytes dropped of almost
one log (Fig. 1B), whereas central memory T cells increased
(Fig. 1C). A similar proportion between effector and memory
T cells was found within the population of IFN-yJr cells
(Fig. 1E), therefore, suggesting that Kh/Tag and IFN-y stained
the same cells. Interestingly, both the percentage (Fig. 1D) and
the absolute number (Fig. 1F) of antigen-speciﬁc CTL remained
stable thereafter, therefore, suggesting that the vaccination pro-
cedure allowed the induction of a long-lasting antigen-speciﬁc
memory response.

3.2 The in silica experiment

To model CTL activation and differentiation into memory T
cells on vaccination with pulsed DCs, we developed a model
based on a system of six ODEs for six different populations
(for details see Section 2).

3.2.] Supporting long last T—memory hypothesis In Figure 2 we
show the ODE immune system behavior for the following enti-
ties: DC-Tag in the injection point and where the antigen is pre-
sented (Di and Dp, respectively), naive, activated and memory
antigen-speciﬁc CTLs (Tn, Ta and Tm), and the levels of IFN—y
released by antigen-speciﬁc CTLs (I), starting from week 8 for a
period of 1 year. To compare ex viva results with the in silica
experiments, we evaluated the total number of activated and
memory CD8+ T cells and their percentage measured at week
9 and 18 (Figs. 3 and 4). Figure 3 shows the total number of
Tag+ cells (both activated and memory antigen-specific CTLs) at
weeks 9 and 18. Comparing these results with Figure 1B, one can
notice that the model qualitatively reproduces the same propor-
tions observed ex viva. Moreover, looking at Figure 4 the per-
centage of speciﬁc memory CTLs follows the same dynamics
observed ex viva in Figure 1C. These results are in good agree-
ment with the ex viva data and all together support the immuno-
logical memory hypothesis.

3.2.2 Prediction of the role of the second injection (Boosting) over
the pool of memory T cells. To both investigate the role of the
second injection (boosting) over the pool of memory Tag-speciﬁc
CTLs and to verify the prediction capabilities of the

mathematical model, we simulated two scenarios. In these simu-
lations we executed, as in previous experiments, the ﬁrst priming
with Dc—Tag at week 8. This priming was followed (or not) by a
second injection of Dc—Tag at week 12 (boost). The outcome of
the experiment was represented by the number of speciﬁc CTLs
(Ta+Tm) at week 9, and at week 18 both in the presence and
absence of the boosting. The simulations showed a lower level of
speciﬁc memory CTLs in the absence of the boosting (Fig. 5).
A similar experiment was then set up in viva, where the mice
were primed at week 8 by DC-Tag. The initial set of mice was
divided in three groups. The ﬁrst group was sacriﬁced at week 9
(priming) to measure primary response. The second and third
groups were left untouched (no boost) or boosted at week 12
with DC-Tag and sacriﬁced after an additional 6 weeks (week
18). As already showed by the mathematical model, the boosting
had a substantial impact on the percentage of CD8+CD44+
CTLs producing IFN-y (Fig. 5), and in viva results reported
the same behaviors (from a qualitative point of View) already

mathematical model demonstrated was able to anticipate the
importance of the second injection in promoting the generation
of long-lived memory CTLs.

3.3 LHS-PRCC sensitivity analysis

Because activated CTLs release IFN-y, we tracked, using PRCC
analysis, the effects of the model parameters on the quantity of
the released cytokine. It is worth mentioning here that the results
of the analysis we performed are strictly dependent on the four-
injection vaccination schedule we have modeled. Results of sen-
sitivity analysis are available as Supplementary Data S1. Here,
we only outline the major findings.

3.3.] Role of C TL differentiation and death rates over
IFN-y Sensitivity analysis reported that memory CTL differ-
entiation rate coefﬁcient a20, which gives an estimation of the
rate of activated CTLs (Ta) that differentiate into memory cells
(Tm), showed a reduced correlation with IFN—y, especially
shortly after every DC-Tag, whereas such a correlation increased
with the distance from the vaccine injection. This can be
explained by the fact that after every injection, the immune re-
sponse is mainly mediated by activated CTLs, whereas memory
CTLs cells give a minor contribution at this time, especially after
the first two injections. Far from injections, the immune response
of activated CTLs declines and memory CTLs become the prin-
cipal cells involved in IFN-y release. Similar considerations also
hold when we verified the impact of memory CTL death rate on
IFN-y.

3.3.2 Role of naive C TL recovery rate over IFN—y The naive cell
recovery rate (hl), which refers to the speed at which the immune
system reconstitutes the naive CTLs pool with newly generated
CTLs, showed almost no correlation between the naive cell re-
covery rate and the IFN-y production, except for a short period
of around week 12, just after the second injection of DCs. At that
time the number of TH was lower than those related to the other
administrations. It is worth noting that higher values of hl would

Fig. 5. Importance of the second injection over the pool of memory
CTLs predicted by the mathematical model (in silica) and conﬁrmed by
the in viva experiment (animal model). Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice
were primed by i.d. injection of DC-Tag and either killed 1 week later
(week 9, n: 5) or boosted (Boost, n = 13) or not (No Boost, n :13) 4
weeks later, and sacriﬁced 10 weeks after priming (week 18). For the in
silica experiment the number of speciﬁc memory CTLs (Tm + Ta) at week
9, and at week 18 both in presence and absence of the boosting were
taken into account. For the in viva experiments, the effector function of
Tag-speciﬁc CD8+T cells was assessed ex viva by ﬂow cytometry analysis
of intracellular IFN-y production in the presence of Tag-IV. Percentage
of IFN-yiproducing cells are depicted after electronic gating on
CD8+CD44Jr viable cells. (Data are representative of at least three inde-
pendent experiments. Statistical analyses were done using the Student’s

entitle faster recruitment of speciﬁc naive CTLs and would allow
higher levels of IFN-y. However, such a parameter cannot be
modiﬁed in Vivo. The presence of a positive PRCC correlation
when the number of T” is low may suggest that the second in-
jection of vaccine is given too early, and it should be advisable to
delay the second injection to give more time to the immune
system to repopulate the specific naive CTLs population until
no correlation is reached. Lack of correlation for the entire
period may represent an important achievement in designing a
treatment that is effective not only for an individual but also for
an entire population because small variations in the rate of re-
covery of naive cells for different individuals would not inﬂuence
the efﬁcacy of the treatment.

4 CONCLUSION

Our in silica model showed the ability to predict the dimension of
the immune response induced in mice by DC vaccination, and
allowed us to deﬁne the relative contribution of several param-
eters (i.e. memory cell differentiation and death rates and naive
cell recovery rate) to the success of the prime-boost strategy. It
also predicted the role of the second injection (Boost) over the
pool of memory T cells. Nevertheless, it allowed the identiﬁca-
tion of a time window in which boosts may be detrimental
(Supplementary Data S1). These ﬁndings appear to be consistent

with data reported by us (Kaech et al., 2002) and (Ricupito et al.,
2013a). We have demonstrated that boosting healthy mice every
2 weeks instead of every month hindered persistence of IFN-
y-competent memory CD8+ T cells (Ricupito et al., 2013a). In
addition, when vaccinated mice were challenged with melanoma
cells, 80% of the mice that had received a monthly boosting
rejected the tumor. Conversely, mice treated with tighter vaccin-
ation schedules survived similarly to non-boosted mice and re-
markably less than mice boosted every month (Ricupito et al.,
2013b). One of the advantages of the system is that several enti-
ties and variables can be added each time. As an example, it
might be interesting to investigate the role of endogenous DCs
and the antigen formulation (e.g. synthetic peptide, protein or
cell fragment) in T-cell priming induced by the vaccine. It has
been reported that the requirement of antigen transfer to en-
dogenous APCs for in viva CTL priming by DC-based vaccines
may depend on the antigen formulation Wewdall et al., 2010).
Furthermore, by adding the characteristic of the patient (e. g. age,
sex, weight, general health status, stage of cancer, comorbidities
and medications) a personalized vaccination schedule might be
generated. One limitation of the reported data is that they were
obtained modeling a healthy subject, and therefore, they are ap-
plicable only for the design of preventive vaccines. The system
needs to be challenged against more stringent biological contexts,
such as in the presence of minimal residual disease or bulky
tumors. Our recent ﬁndings suggest that tumor antigens released
from the tumor as a consequence of either the tumor-cell turn-
over or the immune attack already boost memory T cells induced
by vaccine priming, and vaccine boosts may be detrimental. On
the other hand, the model does not take into account the regu-
lation of T-cell longevity and the peculiarities of the antigens.
These issues appear important and future version of the model
could incorporate them, as wet experiments reveal their roles.

An additional limit of the study is that it is entirely based on
mouse data. There are no published clinical trials in which dif-
ferent vaccination schedules have been compared with induction
of long-lasting antitumor immunity. Most of the vaccination
protocols tested so far in cancer patients stemmed from the ex-
perience with prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases,
which are dissimilar to non-infectious tumors. Thus, reliable
preclinical models are needed to investigate the therapeutic efﬁ-
cacy of cancer vaccines. Mice are the experimental tool of choice
for the majority of tumor immunologists because of the remark-
able similarities between mouse and human immune system.
Nevertheless, signiﬁcant differences exist between mice and
humans in immune system development, cell subpopulations of
both the innate and adaptive arms and perception of endogenous
and exogenous activation signals (Mestas and Hughes, 2004).
This should sound a word of caution to avoid over interpreting
results obtained in mouse models.

Due to the fact that information is also available for humans
on the six different populations we used to develop the related
ODEs, our model might be easily tested in the human context
and provide useful information for DC-based cancer vaccines.

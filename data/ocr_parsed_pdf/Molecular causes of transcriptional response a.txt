ABSTRACT

Motivation: The abundance of many transcripts changes significantly
in response to a variety of molecular and environmental perturbations.
A key question in this setting is as follows: what intermediate molecu-
lar perturbations gave rise to the observed transcriptional changes?
Regulatory programs are not exclusively governed by transcriptional
changes but also by protein abundance and post-translational modi-
fications making direct causal inference from data difficult. However,
biomedical research over the last decades has uncovered a plethora
of causal signaling cascades that can be used to identify good can-
didates explaining a specific set of transcriptional changes.
Methods: We take a Bayesian approach to integrate gene expression
profiling with a causal graph of molecular interactions constructed
from prior biological knowledge. In addition, we define the biological
context of a specific interaction by the corresponding Medical Subject
Headings terms. The Bayesian network can be queried to suggest
upstream regulators that can be causally linked to the altered expres-
sion profile.

Results: Our approach will treat candidate regulators in the right bio-
logical context preferentially, enables hierarchical exploration of result-
ing hypotheses and takes the complete network of causal
relationships into account to arrive at the best set of upstream regu-
lators. We demonstrate the power of our method on distinct biological
datasets, namely response to dexamethasone treatment, stem cell
differentiation and a neuropathic pain model. In all cases relevant bio-
logical insights could be validated.

1 INTRODUCTION

The abundance of many transcripts changes signiﬁcantly in
response to a variety of molecular and environmental perturb-
ations. To understand the details of the transcriptional response,

it is often useful to annotate the biological function of the chan-
ged transcripts using gene set enrichment methods. Ackermann
and Strimmer (2009) give a comprehensive overview and Naeem
et a]. (2012) provide a recent performance assessment of many
methods. However, a key question often remains: what inter-
mediate molecular perturbations gave rise to the observed tran-
scriptional changes? The situation is complicated by the fact that
regulatory programs are not necessarily governed by transcrip-
tional changes but also by protein abundance and post-transla-
tional modiﬁcations. As changes beyond the transcriptional level
are rarely measured, direct inference of causal relationships is
difﬁcult and an active field of research. A number of statistical
and network reconstruction methods have been used to identify
potential gene regulatory networks directly from the gene expres-
sion profiles and large-scale datasets (Dhaeseleer et al., 2000;
Schadt et al., 2005). Although these methods demonstrate
great potential for deciphering mechanisms of regulation, they
require a large number of expression proﬁles and genetic data.
Moreover, determining the sign and direction of the causality can
be challenging. Over the last decades, biomedical research has
uncovered a plethora of causal signaling cascades. Such prior
knowledge can be used to identify good candidates to explain
a speciﬁc set of transcriptional changes and point to others that
cannot be explained satisfactorily by current knowledge.

The use of prior network or pathway knowledge has received
considerable attention in recent years. Emmert—Streib and
Glazko (2011) provide a recent review. More closely related to
our method, Pollard et a]. (2005) developed an approach based
on reasoning on structured collection of causal relationships to
analyze the most likely regulators of expression changes derived
from type 2 diabetes patients and recovered known key genes in
diabetes and proposed new regulators. Chindelevitch et a]. (2012)
constructed a causal graph from a set of causal relationships
extracted from the biomedical literature and introduced a scoring
scheme to identify putative upstream regulators for any given
input dataset based on the set of causal relationships encoded
as the causal graph. Essentially, for each putative upstream regu-
lator, the method makes predictions of the downstream tran-
scriptional effects (upregulation or downregulation) using the
causal relationships. The predictions are then compared with
the observed data and based on the number of correct and
incorrect predictions, a score is assigned to the upstream

regulator. The statistical signiﬁcance of the scores is measured
using an analog of the Fisher’s exact test. Although this method
is able to distinguish the upstream regulator whose associated
transcripts have signiﬁcantly different distribution form the
background, it does not take the full topology of the network
into consideration. More precisely, each regulator is considered
in isolation and the joint distribution of the network is not taken
into consideration. Moreover, the model makes no assumption
on the applicability of the causal relations in the context under
which the experiment is performed.

In this work, we construct a Bayesian network from the same
knowledgebase as in Chindelevitch et al. (2012), consisting of a
set of nearly 450 000 causal relations extracted from nearly 65 000
peer review PubMed full articles. The Bayesian network can be
queried to suggest upstream regulators (hypotheses) that can be
causally linked to the altered expression proﬁle in a manner that
takes the entire topology of the network as well as the context
under which the experiment is performed into consideration. The
noise in the observation is also taken into consideration directly.

Most methods integrating network data into the analysis pro-
cess differ in at least one key point from our Bayesian approach,
namely (i) the use of non-causal non-signed proteiniprotein inter-
action networks, (ii) the use of non-Bayesian approaches, (iii) a
focus on identifying active subnetworks or enriched gene sets, but
not the contextual prediction of upstream regulators active in a
given experiment. A potential problem with our and related
approaches is the availability of a suitable knowledgebase of
causal relationships. Fortunately, public repositories are starting
to appear. For our purposes, the OpenBEL portal (www.openbel.
org) is the most relevant example. It provides an open-source
framework to specify, parse and manipulate causal relationships
and also offers a test corpus under a Creative Commons license of
~70 000 causal statements manually extracted from 16000
PubMed articles. The biological examples in this work rely on a
licensed extended knowledgebase from commercial vendors, i.e.
Ingenuity (www.ingenuity.com) and Selventa (www.se1venta.
com) that consists of about 450 000 statements. Selventa makes
a subset of their knowledge base available at the OpenBEL site.

2 METHODS
2.1 Construction of the directed acyclic graph

In this section, we present the construction of a causal graph from causal
relations extracted from the literature. We ﬁrst need to introduce some
notations and terminology used throughout the article. We use bold char-
acters to denote vectors, upper case letters, such as X to denote a random
variable and lower case letters such as x to denote an instantiation of the
random variable. D(X) denotes the domain of the random variable
X. Subscripts are used to refer to individual random variables, whereas
superscripts are used to distinguish speciﬁc values of a random variable.
Pa(X) and Ch(X) denote the instantiated parents and the children of
the node X, respectively. Finally, we use a negative subscript (—i) to
denote a vector whose i-th component is removed [e.g. x(,,) 2
(X1, ---,Xi71,xi+1, ---,Xn)l-

We are concerned with biological entities and the causal relations be-
tween them; statements such as an increase in X lead to a decrease in
Y. These statements are extracted from biomedical literature. Using these
statements, we construct a signed causal graph where the set of nodes X
consists of transcripts, proteins or compounds. An edge between nodes
X and Yindicates the existence of causal relation between the source node

X and the target node Y, whereas the sign of the edge speciﬁes the dir-
ection of the regulation; (+) if the regulation is positive, i.e. an increase in
X leads to an increase in Y and (—) if the regulation is negative, i.e an
increase in X leads to a decrease in Y. Each edge in the causal network is
annotated with a PubMed id and the corresponding medical subject
headings (MeSH) terms. A regulator is a non-transcript node whose
value is not known a priori. An evidence node is generally a transcript
node whose value is determined from the gene expression data. However,
other nodes in the network can also serve as evidence node if there is prior
knowledge of their state.

The structure of the causal network reﬂects the dependencies and the
direction of causality between the biological entities. In this work, we only
consider the regulators that are directly connected to transcript nodes in
the causal graph and leave longer paths as future work. As a consequence
the graph is acyclic, but the remaining causal relationships in the network
may still be applicable in a certain biological context only (e. g. organism,
tissue, experimental conditions, etc). Hence some of the edges of the
network may not be applicable in the context of the experimental gene
expression data. In the next section, we show how the gene expression
data can be used to deﬁne the context of the experiment and determine
the applicability of the remaining causal relations.

2.2 Deﬁning the context

The causal relations (i.e edges) that are incident to nonzero transcript
nodes of the network, as determined by the gene expression proﬁle,
provide a way to model the applicability of other edges of the network.
We refer to these edges as the ‘nonzero’ network.

MeSH provide a comprehensive controlled database of terms that
index the journal articles in PubMed. MeSH terms can serve to classify
and model the context under which the causal relations are applicable.
To deﬁne the context of the experiment, we performed an enrichment
analysis to identify MeSH terms that the nonzero network is enriched
with (see Supplementary Material for details). We used an False
Discovery Rate (FDR) adjusted P-value of 10’6 as a cutoff threshold
for determining the signiﬁcant MeSH terms. To reduce the computation
time, the signiﬁcant MeSH terms were restricted to those with no more
than 200 annotated edges in the network. An extra artiﬁcial MeSH term
was also deﬁned and every edge in the nonzero network was annotated to
this MeSH term. As will be seen later, this is done to give the causal
relations in the nonzero network a higher probability of being applicable.
In the next section, we will show how these MeSH terms can be integrated
into the network and used to infer the ‘applicability’ of individual causal
relations.

2.3 Construction of the Bayesian network

2.3.] Model We construct a Bayesian network from the signed causal
graph as follows. The nodes of the Bayesian network are discrete random
variables. There are ﬁve classes of nodes in the network.

a Transcript nodes Z = {Z 1 , . . . , Zm}: These are the transcripts whose
values are observed from the gene expression data. These nodes have
domain D(Z) = {—1, 0, + 1} where —1 represents downregulated, 0
represents not differentially expressed and +1 represents upregulated.

a True state of the transcripts ’H 2 {H1, . . . , Hm}: These nodes model
the true state of the genes. The value of these nodes is not known
a priori. These nodes are hidden and do not enter the computations
explicitly. These nodes have domain D(H) = {—1,0, + 1,a} where
the additional state a stands for ‘ambiguous’. This state is necessary
to model the conﬂict in the predictions for a node whose parents are
in disagreement in the direction of regulation.

a Regulator nodes X 2 {X1, ...,X,,}: These are the proteins and
the compounds in the network that potentially regulate the
transcripts. Similar to transcript nodes, these nodes have domain

Causes of transcriptional response

 

D(X) = {—1,0, +1}, where —1 represents downregulated, 0 repre-
sents not regulated and +1 represents upregulated.

0 Applicability nodes A = {A1, ...,A,}: For each edge in the causal
graph, an applicability node is added to the network. The nodes are
connected to the corresponding true state nodes. The value of these
nodes determines the applicability of the corresponding edge. These
are binary nodes with domain D(A) = {0,1} with 0 representing
‘inapplicable’ and 1 representing ‘applicable’.

0 Context nodes C = {C 1, . . . , Ck}: These correspond to the signiﬁcant
MeSH terms obtained from the enrichment analysis. The context
nodes are connected to the applicability node of the edges that are
annotated to the MeSH term. Similar to applicability nodes, these
nodes are also binary with domain D(A) = {0, 1} with 0 representing
‘not in context’ and 1 representing ‘in context’.

Figure 1 illustrates the Bayesian network. In Bauer et al. (2010), a
somewhat similar model has been successfully applied to identify Gene
Ontology terms.

2.3.2 Conditional probabilities Let U,- denote either a regulator node
X,- or an applicability node A, The Markov blanket of the node U,- is
denoted by BU, and is deﬁned to be the set of the parents of U,- together
with its children and parents of its children. In a Bayesian network, the
node U,- is independent of the rest of the random variables when condi-
tioned on its Markov blanket, i.e. Pr(U,-|U(,,)) = Pr(U,-|3U,-). The
Markov blanket of U,- can be partitioned as 3U,- = ZU, 0%,, where
ZU, represents the set of transcript (evidence) nodes along with their
true state, and 3),, the set of regulator, applicability or context nodes
in 3U,-. The transcript nodes and their corresponding true state nodes
are collapsed into one node. Note that for each Z 6 EU],
Pa(Z) C 3),, U {U,-}. In particular, note that U,- e Pa(Z). Let
Pa(Z)(,,) = Pa(Z)\{U,-}. The probability distribution Pr(U, = >|3U,-) is

Note that in the aforementioned equation, all of the variables in 3U,- are
instantiated. We next deﬁne the conditional probabilities of the nodes
that can be used to model the state propagation of the nodes using
Equation (1).

Assume that Z is a transcript node with true state H and n2 number of
parents. Assume that Pa(Z) is in the state xZ = (x1, ...x,,z) where

edges. Then

hem!) (2)

Pr(H = h|Pa(Z) 2 Kg)

The conditional probabilities Pr(ZlH) are deﬁned according to
Table 1. These conditional probabilities are formulated to take the
false-positive (or) and false-negative (,8) rates of the gene expression
data into consideration. In case where the true state of the gene is am-
biguous, the conditional probabilities are assigned to be equally likely.
The false-positive and false-negative rates of gene expression data are
known estimated values. In our computations we used or = 0.05 and
,8 = 0.1. As later will be seen, the inference does not show sensitive de-
pendence on or and ,8 values.

The Markov blanket of Z consists of a set of regulators and their
corresponding applicability nodes. If an applicability node is assigned
to 0, then the corresponding regulator is inapplicable and hence it
should not have any inﬂuence on the value of Z (or H). Hence in deﬁning
the conditional probability Pr(HlPa(Z)), only the regulators whose cor-
responding applicability nodes are nonzero will be taken into consider-
ation. Although this process will largely eliminate the ‘out of context’
edges, there is still a chance that the remaining edges are incorrect for
reasons that are not being taken into consideration by the model. For this
reason, each remaining edge is assigned a probability of being incorrect.
This probability is assigned according to the value of Z, PC if Z 7e 0 and
P,, if Z = 0. The dependence on Z is due to the fact that the applicable
Markov blanket is largely determined by the context nodes, which in turn
are obtained by enrichment analysis of the nonzero network. Hence an
applicable causal relation that invokes a zero transcript is more likely to
be incorrect for reasons not being considered by the model. The values
of these parameters can be integrated in the inference algorithm

Fig. 1. Illustration of the Bayesian network: for each causal relation, an applicability node is constructed. The MeSH terms associated with the PubMed
id of the article reporting the causal relation are used as context nodes that are then connected to the applicability node. To model the noise in
observation, the causal relations are split into two steps: from the regulator to the true (hidden) state of the gene and from the hidden state of the gene to

the observed value of the gene

(see Section 2.4) by introducing the corresponding parameter nodes in the
network and discretizing the parameter values. However, this will sub-
stantially increase the computation time. Therefore, we choose reasonable
values of Pa = 0.7 and PC = 0.1 and conﬁrmed on our trial datasets that
results were not sensitive to the exact choice.

The predicted H value is the vector V 2 (s1 >x1, ...,sk >xnz). Let n,
and n2 be the number of 1 and —1 elements in the vector V
and let n 2 n1 +n2 be the total number of parents in nonzero sates.

able parent nodes. Deﬁne

Here, (1, and (1+ are prior (background) probabilities of genes being
upregulated or downregulated, which can be estimated using the gene
expression data. Precisely, q, = nz/m, (1+ = n+/m where nJr and n, rep-
resent the number of upregulated and downregulated genes in the expres-
sion data and m represents the total number of available genes in the
network. The last two conditional probabilities in Equations (4) and (5)
lkill

are obtained by scaling the probability of not being ambiguous (i.e. W

with the proportions of —1’s [i.e. ﬂ] and 1’s [i.e. ﬂ], respectively. It is
straightforward to show that the

Pr(H = 0|Pa(Z) = xz. 5) = $010. (6)

Here, (10 = no/m is the prior probability of genes being not
regulated, where n0 2 m — (nJr +nz). Intuitively, this means that the
only way that the nonzero applicable parents can predict a zero
state for H is when all the edges are incorrect, in which case the prob-
ability of a 0 true state is assigned according to the background model,
i.e. q0.

If X,- is a regulator node, the prior probability Pr(X, = >|Pa(X,-)) is the
same as the prior probability of the regulator and is deﬁned by
(1 — PZ)/2, P, and (1 — PZ)/2 for states —1, 0, and 1, respectively.
Here, PZ denotes the prior probability of state 0 for the regulator. In
our calculations, we used the PZ = 0.9. Intuitively, setting the prior prob-
ability of the state 0 for regulators to be high will impact the posterior
probabilities in the same direction unless there exists substantial evidence
to support the hypothesis that the regulator is active. If X,- is an applic-

 

ability node with context parents say, (C,l , > > > , Cir) in state (c,,, > > > , Cir),

where W = Z]. chif. Here, W, is a set of weights assigned to the corres-
ponding context node. In our calculations, we set the w,- = 0.3. This is a
desirable way for defining the conditional probability for two reasons.
First, the probability of being in context increases as the number of
nonzero parents increases. Second, this conditional probability has a
transitional property: if the number of nonzero parents of an applicability
node exceeds a certain limit, then the node value will be 1 with high
probability.
Finally, for context nodes C, the conditional probability Pr(C = >|3C)
is given by
Pr(C = ») n Pr(A = a|Pa(A)(,C), C = »)
AEGC 

Z Pr(C = x) H Pr(A = a|Pa(A)(,C), C = x)

where Pr(A = a|Pa(A)(,C)), is deﬁned by Equation (7) and the prior
probability Pr(C = >) = 0.5. The state of artificially added context node
is set to 1.

In the next section, we address the problem of inference from the
Bayesian network.

2.4 Inference

Since exact inference in Bayesian networks are often impractical due
to prohibitive time and memory demands, sampling techniques are
commonly used for approximate inference. We wish to generate
samples {u’};1 from the joint probability distribution Pr(UlZ :2).
Here, U 2 (U1, ..., U") represents the regulator (Xi), applicability (A,)
or context (Ci) nodes and Z = (Z1, ...,Zm) represents the evidence
(e.g. transcript) nodes. Note that the evidence node generally com-
prises the instantiated transcript nodes obtained from the gene expres-
sion data. However, the evidence node is not limited to transcripts
only. For instance, if there is evidence that a certain regulator is
active, or if a causal relation is inapplicable, the corresponding
nodes can be treated as evidence nodes with ﬁxed prespeciﬁed
values. Using the generated samples, we can then approximate the
posterior marginal Pr(U, =u,—|Z=z) of a given non-evidence node
U,- by

T
Pr(U, = uiiz) = 1T2 so. u') (9)
i=1

where T denotes the total number of samples generated and 8(u,-, u’) = 1
if u’(i) = u,- and 0 otherwise. In our computations, we used Gibbs sam-
pling, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method that is particularly well
suited to sample the posterior distribution from a Bayesian network.
All non-evidence nodes are ﬁrst randomly initialized. The values of the
nodes are then updated iteratively using Equations (1), (7) or (8) depend-
ing on the node type. When generating the tth sample for the random
variable U,-, we use uéio = (143, . . . , 1431,1431, . . . , 14:1) to instantiate 3U,-,
where the random variables U, to Uizl are instantiated with their tth
sample, and the random variables from U,-+1 to U” are instantiated with
their previous sample, i.e. (t — 1) th sample. Algorithm 1 summarizes the
inference procedure.

It can be shown that the sequence of samples comprises a Markov
chain whose stationary distribution is sought after distribution
Pr(UlZ = z). We generated samples from the joint distribution by run-
ning multiple chains of the Gibbs sampler in parallel. Moreover, to in-
vestigate the existence of alternative regulators, we can run
the simulations in an iterative manner as follows. In the ﬁrst iteration,
the inference is performed and top regulators are selected. Next, the
simulations are performed again while setting some or all of the previ-
ously selected regulators to 0. This iterative process can be continued for
either a speciﬁc number of times or until no further regulators are
produced.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulated data

To test the performance of our method, we simulated data by
perturbing a single regulator in a speciﬁc context. In our test, we
used PPARG as an example of a protein with two distinct
biological functions, i.e. (i) its role in immune system regulation
and (ii) its function as a key enzyme of lipid metabolism and
adipogenesis (Tontonoz and Spiegelman, 2008; Zieleniak et al.,
2008). In each context, we selected related MeSH terms and the
corresponding causal relations and then simulated the gene
expression data at the false-positive rate a = 0.05 and false-nega-
tive rate 8 = 0.1, assuming upregulation of PPARG. Figure 2
illustrates the simulation. For each simulated input set, our
method correctly predicted PPARG as the only upstream cause
of the observed variation with high probability. Moreover, the
MeSH enrichment analysis and the subsequent inference cor-
rectly recover the majority of the MeSH terms. In contrast,
there were no signiﬁcant regulators reported when generating
random expression proﬁles of the same size. We also assessed
the sensitivity of the predictions to parameters a and 8 by simu-
lating gene expression data using different values of these

parameters. We selected a grid 0 5 (1,8 5 0.3 with step size
0.02, simulating a total of 256 datasets. The case a = 1/ 3 and
8 = 1 / 3 corresponds to random data generation (see Table 1). In
prediction step, the ﬁxed values a = 0.05 and 8 = 0.1 were used.
The simulation was performed in adipogenesis context where
more genes (171) are downstream of PPARG. In 253 cases of
256 simulation runs, PPARG was selected as the top ranking
regulator with high probability and in 201 of these cases
PPARG was the only predicted regulator. Other cases included
1 (50 cases), 2 (3 cases) or 3 (2 cases) extra predicted regulators,
mostly with low probabilities. See Supplementary Material for a
heat map of false positives.

3.2 Dexamethasone: recovering a known mode-of-action

To characterize the performance of our method on biological
data, we analyzed an experiment of Stojadinovic et al. (2007)
in which primary human keratinocytes were treated with
dexamethasone. The objective of the original study was to inves-
tigate the detailed mechanisms of glucocorticoid receptor signal-
ing in skin cells. The authors particularly highlight suppression
of interferon gamma (IFNG) and suppression of transforming
growth factor beta (TGFB) among the prominent pathways af-
fected. A signiﬁcant indication of the performance of our method
is the concordance of the top regulators with the conclusions
from the original study (Table 2). The primary experimental per-

dexamethasone as correct but wishing to ﬁnd the molecule
through which it asserts its function, we removed dexamethasone
from consideration and ran a subsequent iteration. The activa-
tion of NR3CI, the primary target of dexamethasone, was cor-
rectly identiﬁed as the top regulator in this iteration. This
exempliﬁes the possibility of using our methods in iterations to
uncover the layers of signaling.

The inferred enriched MeSH terms are also in agreement with
the biological context of the regulators including terms such as
dexamethsone and glucocorticoid. Instances where MeSH terms
could provide additional context information include the
MeSH terms for TGFBI where the most enriched term is
‘Dermis/drug effects’ consistent with the skin cell model used
in the experiment.

3.3 In vivo model of pain

To further evaluate the ability of our method to identify tran-
scriptional regulators of biological processes, we used a more
complex dataset with no single perturbation. Costigan et al.
(2009) undertook gene expression studies of dorsal horn tissue
from the spinal cord of rats subjected to a surgical procedure
designed to induce neuropathic pain. From this the authors
hypothesized and subsequently experimentally conﬁrmed that
IFNG is required for the development of neuropathic pain. The
raw data from this study were Robust M ultichip Average normal-
ized and limma was used to identify differentially expressed
genes. Genes were considered signiﬁcant if their FDR corrected
P—Value was <0.05 (204 genes upregulated and 3 genes down-
regulated). Our method determined IFNG+ to have the greatest
probability (0.958) and to correctly explain 48 of the gene
expression changesaﬂearly conﬁrming one validated molecular
key aspect of the experiment.

model.

3.4 Drivers of stem cell differentiation

Finally, we assessed our method by analyzing an in vitro differ-
entiation model of pancreatic beta cell development (D’Amour
et al., 2006; Gutteridge et al., 2013). At the time points analyzed
(day 8 and day 11) the cells transition from NEUROG3+ pan-
creatic progenitor cells to NKX2-2+ endocrine cells capable of
further differentiation into fully functional insulin producing
cells upon implantation into mice (Kroon et al., 2008). The top
causal regulators for this transition are shown in Table 3. The
gene identiﬁed as the top ranked regulator, NEUROG3, is a
bHLH family transcription factor that is known to be intimately
involved in the development of the pancreatic endocrine cell lin-
eage (Gradwohl et al., 2000; Rukstalis and Habener, 2009) and is
itself strongly expressed at these time points. The MesH terms
associated with NEUROG3 include ‘Pancreatic Ducts/embry-
ology’ conﬁrming the link to pancreatic development.
Alongside NEUROG3, our method also highlights Beta-estradiol
signaling as the second highest ranked regulator. Beta-estradiol is
a hormone that is known to have an important role in both
pancreatic function (Tiano and Mauvais-Jarvis, 2012) and the
survival of insulin producing beta cells in particular (Nadal
et al., 2009). In ranking these two regulators at the top, our
method clearly shows that it is able to identify several of the
key regulators of this complex and clinically important develop-
mental process.

As well as entities with well-established links to pancreatic
development, the results also point toward perhaps surprising
roles for several inﬂammatory cytokines including IFNG, TNF
and IL6, upregulation of which are all proposed as causal drivers
during this stage of development. IFNG has long been known to
have a role, particularly in the context of type 1 diabetes, in
modulating beta cell function (Nielsen et al., 2001), and the
role of 1L6 in pancreas function is supported by an emerging
body of literature (da Silva Krause et al., 2012). The
MeSH terms associated with 1L6 include several relating to

Causes of transcriptional response

 

trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibition, which is a function of the
pancreas. Recent experiments made directly on the model used
here have shown a role for 1L6 in the in vitro development of
pancreatic endocrine cells (Gutteridge et al., 2013) confirming the
BayesCRE prediction.

Interestingly IFNG is selected as a top regulator in all three
experiments (upregulated in the model of pain and stem cell dif-
ferentiation and downregulated in dexamethasone). In each case,
the inferred MeSH term provides information on the
context of the experiment. In the case of the dexamethasone,
‘Dexamethasone/antagonists & inhibitors’ is one of the top
inferred MeSH terms, clearly distinguishing the experiment. In
the case of stem cell differentiation, MeSH terms include ‘dia-
betes mellitus’ as well as ‘insulin like growth factor’ and
‘adrenomedullin’, indicating the association with beta cell differ-
entiation and pancreas. These terms do not appear in other
experiments. In the case of the model of pain, the inferred
IFNG associated MeSH term is mostly related to IFNG function
as an immune mediator. This is expected, given that the model of
pain is a more generic whole animal system with no single obvi-
ous point of intervention.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we present a Bayesian methodology capable of
identifying speciﬁc, plausible and testable biological hypothesis
consistent with the observed gene expression data. We do this by
reasoning over a massive knowledge base of prior biological
knowledge extracted from the literature. Our method is an ex-
tension of the approach developed by Chindelevitch et al. (2012).
There, the statistical signiﬁcance of upstream regulators is tested
in isolation, i.e. the existence of alternative regulators is not taken
into consideration when assessing the signiﬁcance. Our method
generalizes this by constructing a Bayesian network from the
knowledge base and considering the joint probability distribution
of the possible molecular drivers of the observed expression pro-
ﬁle (see Supplementary Material for benchmark results).
Additionally, our new method models the context of the experi-
ment by introducing the enriched MeSH terms of the network of
differentially expressed genes as nodes in the Bayesian network.
This will signiﬁcantly remove the noise and redundancy in the
network.

In conclusion, we find that our new method is well able to
identify the key regulators in simulated and actual biological
data. The nature of the output is well suited for the direct pro-
posal of novel testable hypotheses, such as a role for 1L6 of
endocrine pancreas development or the causal aspect of IFNG
in a system as noisy as a surgical in vivo model of pain. We are
currently pursuing an extension of our method that will integrate
higher-level causal drivers in the network. Finally, our method
provides a natural framework for integrating omic—scale dataset
with prior biological knowledge to identify concise, coherent and
testable biological hypothesis.

Abstract

Summary: We present ChAsE, a cross—platform desktop application developed for interactive visu—
alization, exploration and clustering of epigenomic data such as ChlP—seq experiments. ChAsE is
designed and developed in close collaboration with several groups of biologists and bioinformati—
cians with a focus on usability and interactivity. Data can be analyzed through k—means clustering,
specifying presence or absence of signal in epigenetic data and performing set operations between
clusters. Results can be explored in an interactive heat map and profile plot interface and exported
for downstream analysis or as high quality figures suitable for publications.

1 Introduction

Epigenetics is the study of changes in the regulation of gene activity
and expression that are not dependent on gene sequence. Advances
in DNA sequencing technology have enabled researchers to investi—
gate the epigenetic state of cells by profiling modifications such as
histone methylation across the whole genome using techniques such
as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP—
seq). While computational methods to interpret ChIP—seq data con—
tinue to evolve and improve, many questions cannot be easily ad—
dressed in an automated fashion, and biologists need to be engaged
directly in data processing and interpretation.

Several techniques such as ChromaSig (Hon et (11., 2008) and
ChromHMM (Ernst and Kellis, 2010) use probabilistic methods for
the discovery of epigenetic signatures, but often require significant
computational skill to use. Platforms such as Cistrome (Liu et (11.,

2011) and SeqMonk (www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/
seqmonk) provide a tool chain of diverse analysis methods and graph—
ical interfaces for improved usability; however, they offer limited
interactivity and visualization. Genome browsers such as the WashU
Epigenome Browser (Zhou et (11., 2011) are popular interactive visual—
ization tools that plot data along a reference genome coordinate and
display epigenomic marks as separate tracks vertically stacked to fa—
cilitate comparison. Local regions can be viewed one—at—a—time, but
obtaining an overview of global data patterns can be challenging.
More recently, Epiviz (Chelaru et (11., 2014) provides a scripting inter—
face in addition to the genome browser, to allow invoking R functions
and displaying the results within the tool, however, this extension re—
mains accessible only to users with relevant technical skills.

To lower this computational barrier, we had previously de—
veloped Spark (Nielsen et (11., 2012) which employed an interactive

visualization for pattern discovery, particularly in the early data ex—
ploration phases. However, support for cluster comparison and the
ability to directly query for clusters with specific data patterns re—
main outstanding needs. In addition we realized that most biologists
prefer a standard heat map visualization for communicating and
publishing results.

Observing the limitations of available solutions, we designed and
developed ChAsE in close collaboration with several groups of
biologists and bioinformaticians with a focus on usability and inter—
activity. The main features include:

' exploration through multiple linked interfaces including an inter—
active heat map and proﬁle plot;

' automatic clustering using k—means or manual clustering by sort—
ing and selecting items in the heat map;

' querying for absence or presence of signal in epigenomic marks;

' comparing clusters by performing set operations;

' exporting results for downstream analysis as well as producing
high quality ﬁgures for publications. (examples included in the
supplementary document).

2 Methods
2.1 Data input

The input dialog allows users to specify one or more marks as
genome—wide read density data files (in Wig or bigWig formats) and
a single region set containing genomic intervals of interest, such as
regions around transcription start sites (in GFF or BED formats).
Other parameters such as binning and normalization can be speci—
fied to allow for effective comparison of different marks on a uni—
form scale. The processing time depends on the size of the input and
typically takes a few minutes per mark; however the processed data
are stored so future loading will be only a few seconds per data.

2.2 Exploration

The graphical user interface consists of multiple linked panes. The
‘Workspace’ pane (Fig. 1(a)) shows a snapshot of the current ana—
lysis and is organized in a table layout where columns correspond to
marks and rows correspond to subsets (clusters). Mark names are
shown above the columns and clusters can have user specified labels.
Each cell shows an average of the data for one mark in a subset as a
profile plot, where the x—axis is relative position in the region and
the y—axis is the signal value. For each subset, the left most column
shows an overlay of the profile plots of all marks, as well as the size
of the subset. Subsets can also be added to the ‘Favourites’ pane
(Fig. 1 (b)), and brought back to the workspace as needed.

The ‘Heat map’ pane (Fig. 1(c)) displays a heat map view of the
subsets. Each pixel row corresponds to one or more genomic regions
and columns correspond to marks. The rows have a consistent order
across the columns and can be sorted by several criteria such as sig—
nal average or user specified annotations. Users can interactively
zoom and pan the heat map or drag over the heat map and create a
subset of the selected regions.

The ‘Plot’ pane (Fig. 1(d)) shows a zoomed version of a single
profile plot or the overlay plot where the profiles of all marks for a
subset are displayed together. As the user moves the mouse over the
plots, the corresponding mark is highlighted in the plot legend and
across other panes.

Users can add custom labels to the subsets and export them as
BED or GFF files (same format as the input regions file) for down—
stream analysis. In addition, the heat map or profile plots can be

2.3 Analysis

Methods are accessed from the menu and appear above the work—
space pane (Fig. 1(e)). The ‘K—means’ method allows performing a
clustering on the currently selected subset or the entire dataset. A
user can indicate the number of clusters and toggle the check—boxes
above the marks to specify which marks are included in the cluster—
ing. Clicking the ‘Run’ button executes the clustering and the results
appear in the workspace in a tree structure. As the exploration con—
tinues, the user might be clustering subsets. To help him/her capture
the exploration history, the clusters and subsequent cluster are
organized in a hierarchical tree interface.

Subsets with child nodes are shown by a (—) sign when expanded
or EB sign when collapsed, and the leaf nodes are represented with
solid circles. The user can further select a subset and perform clus—
tering hierarchically.

The ‘Signal Query’ method shown in Figure 1(f) allows users to
find regions with the signal present or absent in any combination of
the marks. Once selected, the first row shows the input region sets
with on/off switches allowing the user to specify either presence (on—
selected), absence (off—selected) or no preference (neither selected).
A region is considered having a signal if there is any enrichment of
the corresponding mark within the bounds of the region. This would
be most effective if the enrichment peaks have already been detected
through a peak finding tool such as FindPeaks (Fejes et al., 2008).
The second row shows a preview of the result for the currently se—
lected combination and is dynamically updated as the user makes
changes. Upon clicking the ‘Add’ button, the result is added to the
Workspace.

The ‘Comparison’ method shown in Figure 1(g) allows the user
to perform intersections across multiple subsets. The check box on
the left of the summary plot for each subset allows the user to spe—
cify either inclusion (set intersection) or exclusion (set subtraction)
of the set regions. Any subset currently present in the workspace

may be used in the comparison method. For instance, the clusters
might be from different runs of k—means on different marks or re—
sults of the signal query.

3 Application

We used ChAsE to study the relationships between DNA methyla—
tion, histone modifications and several DNA—binding regulatory
proteins in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) (data available at
the tool website). After loading the data, we performed a clustering
across promoter regions using ChIP—seq data for H3K4me3 and
H3K27me3, histone modifications characteristic of transcriptionally
active and silent promoters, respectively. We specified these two
marks for clustering by selecting the corresponding check boxes in
k—means pane (Fig. 1(6)). The clustering results are shown in a tree
in the workspace pane in Figure 1(a) with each cluster connected to
the corresponding section in the heat map in Figure 1(c). The top
cluster shows low H3K27me3 (blue) and moderate to high
H3K4me3 (yellow—red) indicative of ‘active’ promoters. In contrast,
the middle cluster has moderate H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (blue—
yellow) typical of transcriptionally poised or ‘bivalent’ promoters.
The bottom cluster contains low levels of both modifications (blue)
indicative of ‘inactive’ promoters. We used the contextual menu to
appropriately label each of the clusters in the workspace pane.

We wanted to examine the DNA methylation status of these sub—
populations, as well as to study the TET family of proteins known
to catalyze the oxidation of 5—methylcytosine (5mC) to 5—hydroxyl—
methylcytosine (5th). Consistent with recent reports (Yu et al.,
2012), we observed high levels of 5th in the presence of TET1 at
bivalent promoters in the middle cluster of Figure 1(c). Intriguingly,
the top cluster of Figure 1(c) shows high levels of TET1, but only
low to moderate levels of 5mC and 5 th consistent with the model
that H3K4me3—marked promoters harbor very low levels of DNA
methylation. We also investigated the enrichment of the ESET his—
tone methyltransferase at gene promoters. This protein catalyzes the
methylation of H3K9 and deposition of H3K9me3 at retrotrans—
posons and certain gene promoters (Karimi et al., 2011). Examining
H3K9me3 and ESET ChIP—seq datasets revealed that ESET bound
promoters in the top and middle clusters were almost all devoid of
H3K9me3. This raised the possibility that ESET functions at pro—
moters independent of its catalytic activity, perhaps to positively in—
ﬂuence transcription. Furthermore, the presence of H3K4me3 at

both the top and middle clusters may prevent the bound ESET from
depositing H3K9me3 at such genomic sites. Although these observa—
tions have yet to be validated by further lab experiments, this ex—
ample demonstrated the effectiveness of ChAsE for deriving new
hypotheses.

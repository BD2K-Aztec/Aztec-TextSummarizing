Abstract

Motivation: Graphical models are often employed to interpret patterns of correlations observed in
data through a network of interactions between the variables. Recently, lsing/Potts models, also
known as Markov random fields, have been productively applied to diverse problems in biology,
including the prediction of structural contacts from protein sequence data and the description of
neural activity patterns. However, inference of such models is a challenging computational prob—
lem that cannot be solved exactly. Here, we describe the adaptive cluster expansion (ACE) method
to quickly and accurately infer lsing or Potts models based on correlation data. ACE avoids overfit—
ting by constructing a sparse network of interactions sufficient to reproduce the observed correl—
ation data within the statistical error expected due to finite sampling. When convergence of the
ACE algorithm is slow, we combine it with a Boltzmann Machine Learning algorithm (BML). We
illustrate this method on a variety of biological and artificial datasets and compare it to state—of—the—
art approximate methods such as Gaussian and pseudo—likelihood inference.

Results: We show that ACE accurately reproduces the true parameters of the underlying model
when they are known, and yields accurate statistical descriptions of both biological and artificial
data. Models inferred by ACE more accurately describe the statistics of the data, including both the
constrained low—order correlations and unconstrained higher—order correlations, compared to
those obtained by faster Gaussian and pseudo—likelihood methods. These alternative approaches
can recover the structure of the interaction network but typically not the correct strength of inter—
actions, resulting in less accurate generative models.

1 Introduction

Interpreting patterns of correlations in data is a fundamental prob—
lem across scientific disciplines. A common approach to this prob—
lem is to infer a simple graphical model that explains the statistics
of the data through a network of effective interactions between
the variables, which may then be used to generate new predictions
(Friedman, 2004). The goal of this approach is to disentangle the
direct interactions between variables from their correlations,
which arise through a combination of direct and indirect effects.
Here, we focus on a particular family of undirected graphical
models, referred to as Potts models in the language of statistical
physics, which have recently been applied to study a wide variety
of biological systems. Applications include inference of the effect—
ive connectivity of populations of neurons, and their patterns of
firing activity, based on data from multi—electrode
recordings (Barton and Cocco, 2013; Cocco et al., 2009; Roudi
et al., 2009; Schneidman et al., 2006), and the prediction of pro—
tein contact residues (Morcos et al., 2011) and the fitness effects
of mutations (Ferguson et al., 2013; Figliuzzi et al., 2016; Mann
et al., 2014) based on the analysis of multiple sequence alignments
(MSAs).

Unfortunately, the inference of Potts models from data is chal—
lenging. The computational time required for naive Potts inference
algorithms scales exponentially with the system size, rendering the
problem intractable for realistic systems of interest. Various ap—
proximations have been employed to combat this problem, includ—
ing Gaussian and mean—field inference (Kappen and Rodriguez,
1998), perturbative expansions (Nguyen and Berg, 2012; Sessak and
Monasson, 2009) and pseudo—likelihood methods (Aurell and
Ekeberg, 2012; Ravikumar et al., 2010). These approximate meth—
ods can successfully capture the general structure of the network of
interactions, recovering, in particular, contact residues in the three—
dimensional structure of protein families (Cocco et al., 2013;
Ekeberg et al., 2014; Feinauer et al., 2014; Hopf et al., 2012; Marks
et al., 2011; Morcos et al., 2011; Sulkowska et al., 2012), but the re—
sulting models typically give a less accurate statistical description of
the data (Barton et al., 2014). Alternately, algorithms based on itera—
tive rounds of Monte Carlo simulation (Ackley et al., 1985; Mann
et al., 2014; Sutto et al., 2015) are capable of inferring models that
accurately reproduce the observed correlations, but they are typic—
ally slow to converge.

Here, we describe an extension of the adaptive cluster expansion
(ACE) method, originally devised for binary (Ising) variables (Cocco
and Monasson, 2011, 2012), to more general (Potts) variables tak—
ing multiple categorical values. We also describe new computational
methods for faster inference, including a Monte Carlo learning pro—
cedure and the optional incorporation of prior knowledge about the
structure of the interaction graph. The algorithm has been success—
fully applied to real data with as many as several hundred variables,
including studies of neural activity in the retina and prefrontal cor—
tex (Barton and Cocco, 2013; Cocco and Monasson, 2011, 2012;
Tavoni et al., 2015), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) fitness
based on protein MSA data (Barton et al., 2015; Mann et al., 2014),
and lattice protein models (Jacquin et al., 2016). Below we illustrate
the application of this method to both real and artificial datasets.
We show that models inferred by ACE give an excellent reconstruc—
tion of the statistics of the data. They also accurately recover, con—
sidering sampling limitations, true underlying model parameters
when they are known, and can achieve comparable performance to
state—of—the—art methods for predicting structural contacts in protein
family data. We compare these results to those obtained using other

approximate inference methods, focusing in particular on pseudo—
likelihood methods.

1.1 Background

The Potts model emerges naturally in the statistical description of
complex systems. Consider a system of N variables described by the
configuration x : {x1,x2, . . . ,xN}, with x,- 6 {1,2, . . . ,qi}. The
number of discrete categories q,- that each variable x,- can take on,
which we refer to as states, may depend on the variable index i. For
proteins the states correspond to particular amino acids, while for
neurons they represent the binary (firing or silent) state of activity.
Given a set of measurements of the system, the empirical average
over the sampled configurations gives us the 2,1], individual and
Z,- <iqiqi pairwise frequencies for the different states of each vari—
able in the data. We denote the individual and pairwise frequencies
by 17,-(a) and 17,7(a, b), respectively, where i, j are the index of the
variables and a, b are the index of the states. As an example, x could
represent sequences in a MSA, with 17,-(a) the frequency of the amino
acid labeled by a in column 1' of the alignment, and 17,7(a, b) the fre—
quency of the pair of amino acids a, b in columns 1', j.

The simplest, or maximum entropy (Jaynes, 1982), probabilistic
model capable of reproducing the observed frequencies is an expo—
nential distribution, which assigns a probability to every configur—
ation of the system x:

Z 7
N N—1 N
E(X) : —Zl’7i(xi) — Z Z]ij(xi7xi)v (1)
i:1 i:1/':i+1

Z : Zexp (—E(X)).

Here, the partition function Z is a normalizing factor which ensures
that all probabilities sum to one. In the simple case that all the variables
x,- are binary, this model is referred to as an Ising model. More gener—
ally, when x, can take multiple discrete states, this model is referred to
as a Potts model. The parameters 17,-(a) and ],-,-(a, b) in the energy func—
tion E, called fields and couplings, must be chosen such that variable
averages (correlations) in the model match those in the data, i.e.

PM) 2 25003101300)
x (2)
1717(4) I 2 5007505097 b)P(X)7

where 5 is the Kronecker delta function. The problem of finding the
parameters 17,-(a), ],-,-(a,b) that satisfy Equation (2) is referred to as
the inverse Potts problem. Note that the probability of any configur—
ation remains unchanged under the transformation of the couplings
and fields given by Ii,"(d,  —> Ii,"(d,  + K1701) + Kﬁ(b), [71(4) —> [71(4)
—2i #1. Kil-(a) for any K. In addition, all the 17,-(a) at a site i can be uni—
formly shifted by a constant with no effect on the probability. This
‘gauge invariance’ reduces the number of free parameters in the Potts
model to q,- — 1 fields for each site and (q,- — 1)(q,- — 1) couplings for
each pair of sites.

Formally, the inverse Potts problem is solved by the set of fields
and couplings that maximize the average log—posterior probability
of the data or equivalently, those that minimize the cross—entropy
between the data and the model

and P0 is a prior distribution for the parameters. Here, for simplicity
we have written the set of all individual and pairwise variable fre—
quencies as p and the set of all fields and couplings as]. Note that,
ignoring the contribution of the prior distribution, the cross—entropy
S is equivalent to the entropy of the inferred model satisfying
Equation (2). S has a simple interpretation in information theory as
it can be written as the sum of the entropy of the data and the
Kullback—Leibler divergence of the model with respect to the data
(Shannon, 1948), see also the related field of information geometry
(Amari, 1987).

The inclusion of a prior distribution helps to avoid overfitting,
while also improving convergence. A Gaussian prior distribution for
the parameters is a typical choice, which contributes a term

to Equation (3). For v N 1/B this factor can be thought of as a
weakly informative prior (Gelman et al., 2008) whose main
purpose is to ensure that solutions of the inverse problem are not
infinite due to issues of undersampling (e.g. parameters corres—
ponding to an amino acid that is never observed). Note that this
form of the regularization is not invariant under gauge transform—
ations. Thus, the results of the inference including the regulariza—
tion do have some dependence on the gauge choice. Other forms
of regularization are also possible (see Supplementary Materials).
Note that the presence of the partition function Z in Equation (4)
precludes direct numerical maximization of the posterior when
the system size is large, since this requires summing over all
H111 q,- configurations of the system. Alternate methods of solving
the inverse Potts problem involve approximation schemes or rely
on computationally costly Monte Carlo simulations, as described
above.

2 Methods

2.1 Adaptive cluster expansion

The adaptive cluster expansion (Cocco and Monasson, 2011, 2012)
is based on the formal decomposition of the regularized cross—
entropy Equation (3) into a sum of contributions from subsets (clus—
ters) of variables F : {i1, . . . ,ik}, k S N,

szzAsr,
F

Asp : Sr — Z Asp, (6)

F’CF

where the sum is over all nonempty subsets of the N variables. The
terms ASr, referred to as cluster entropies, have been recursively
defined as the remaining contribution to the subset posterior once
all contributions from smaller clusters have been substracted. Here,
Sr denotes the maximum of Equation (3) restricted only to the vari—
ables in F. Thus, Sr depends only on the frequencies 1),-(a), 17,7(a, b)
with i,/' E F. Provided that the number of variables in F is small
(typically 520), numerical maximization of the posterior restricted
to F is tractable. Note that, due to the recursive definition of ASr,

the sum over all 2N — 1 nonempty and overlapping subsets of the N
variables in Equation (6) gives the exact posterior S by construction:

ErjAsr : Asp“ + 2 A5,, : Sr,“ : s. (7)

F’Cnm

Here, I"tot : {1,2, . . . ,N} is the set of all variables in the system.
The expansion of Equation (6) can be computationally expedient be—
cause, practically, it can converge toward S even when only contri—
butions from clusters much smaller than the system size N are
considered (see below).

The cluster entropy contributions are easy to interpret for one—
and two—site clusters: neglecting the regularization term the single
variable cluster contributions are the entropies of the variables taken
as if they were independent, AS,- E S,- : —ZZ‘:1 pilog 1),-(a). The two
variable entropy is S,-,- : — Z; ZZL1P,i(a,b)logp,-i(a,b) (see
Supplementary Materials for more details). The cluster entropy for a
pair of variables is then ASii : Si,- — S,- — S,-, which is equivalent to
the mutual information. It is zero when 17,7(a, b) : 1),-(a) 1),-(b), i.e.
when the two variables are independent. More generally, ASr is a
measure of the interdependence between the variables in the cluster
which cannot be accounted for by smaller clusters.

The main idea of this approach is to approximate the cross—
entropy (and simultaneously, the parameters that maximize it) by
limiting the sum in Equation (6) to a restricted set of clusters F that
give the most important contributions to it. As shown in (Cocco and
Monasson, 201 1, 2012), contributions for overlapping clusters shar—
ing the same interaction subgraph partially compensate, and thus
summing clusters according to the magnitude of their entropy con—
tribution allows for a faster convergence of Equation (6 ). Neglecting
clusters with small contributions to the cross—entropy also helps to
avoid overfitting. As a simple example, for a unidimensional inter—
action graph in which each variable is only connected to its two
nearest neighbors, the expansion can be exactly truncated by sum—
ming only clusters of size one and the largest contributing 2—site
clusters containing neighboring variables (Cocco and Monasson,
2012; Gori and Trombettoni, 2011; Mastromatteo, 2013).

We define a threshold t on the cross—entropy to separate the sig—
nificant clusters from those which can be neglected. Starting from a
large value of the threshold (typically t: 1), such that only a few
clusters are selected, the algorithm proceeds through two nested iter—
ations. The outer loop is on the value of the threshold t, which is
progressively lowered until enough clusters are included to yield a
model consistent with the data. The inner loop constructs the set of
clusters F with contributions to the cross—entropy IASrI > t and
yields an approximation of the cross—entropy and the model param—
eters at the threshold t. The algorithm stops at the first value of the
threshold t where the inferred model fits the sampled averages and
correlations Equation (2) to within the statistical error due to finite
sampling (see Section 3.2).

The algorithm for the inner loop, including the selection
and summation of individual clusters, is as follows. Given a list L1z
of clusters of size [2, beginning with the list of all clusters of size
[2 : 2:

The rule for constructing new clusters of size [2 + 1 from selected
clusters of size [2 can be lax (such that a new cluster F is added pro—
vided that any pair of size [2 subclusters, F1, F2 6 L),(t) and
F1 U F2 : F) or strict (such that a new cluster is only added if all of
its [2 + 1 subclusters of size [2 belong to L),(t)). The above process is
then repeated until no new clusters can be constructed.

After the summation of clusters terminates, the approximate
value of the parameters minimizing the cross—entropy, given the cur—
rent value of the threshold, is computed by

Note that this formula generally yields sparse solutions because
nonzero couplings are only included in Equation (8) if some clusters

evaluation of the partition function Z for large cluster sizes, which

2.2 Compression of the number of Potts states

As mentioned in Section 1.1, the number of states each variable may
take on need not be the same for all variables in a system. States
with zero (or otherwise very small) probabilities may be observed
very infrequently in real, finitely—sampled data, and the relative error
on the corresponding correlations due to finite sampling is large.

To limit overfitting and reduce the computational time, the low
probability states can be effectively grouped together according to a
given compression parameter. Here, we present two heuristic con—
ventions for compressed representations of the data. First, for each
variable we can treat explicitly the states observed with probability
larger than a cutoff value 1),-(a) > 170 while grouping all infrequently
observed values into the same state. A natural value for the cutoff is
17,, ~ 1/\/B, such that pair correlations between independent states
with frequencies of 170 are at the threshold of detection.
Alternatively, we can order the states by their contribution to the
total single site entropy S, and choose a reduced model in which
only the first [2 states are modeled explicitly, with k chosen to cap—
ture a certain fraction f of the site entropy. This is achieved by expli—
citly considering the first [2 states and grouping the remaining q — [2
states together, choosing k such that

2,8,.

The frequency of the regrouped Potts state is then the sum of the
frequencies of the states which have been regrouped:
1),-(k + 1) : 2:), +1 1),-(a). Once the reduced model is inferred, one
can recover a complete model by modifying the field parameter for
the regrouped states, 17,-(a’) : 17,-(k + 1) + log (pi(a’)/p,-(k + 1)),
while keeping the couplings to the value of the regrouped state
],-,-(a’, b) : ],-,-(k + 1, b). For states with zero probabilities in the data,
we fix the fields from the regularization alone.

2.3 Expansion around a reference structure

ACE is a two—fold algorithm: it builds up the interaction graph while
also inferring the parameters that reproduce the correlated structure
of the data. This expansion can be accelerated if information about
the interaction graph is available. It is also possible to expand the
cross—entropy around its Gaussian approximation.

' If the list of directly interacting variables is known, one can run
the expansion starting from clusters built on the support of the
interaction graph. For proteins this procedure can be applied
using the real contact map, known from structural informa—
tion, as the initial list of 2—site clusters. Alternatively, if the
contact map is not known, one can use fast inference
approaches such as DCA or plmDCA (Ekeberg et al., 2014;
Morcos et al., 2011) to obtain a list of initial putative contacts
and then reﬁne the expansion from this initial list
(Supplementary Materials).

' As shown in (Cocco and Monasson, 2012) for the Ising model,
one can analytically calculate the posterior and the parameters
that maximize it under the Gaussian approximation with an ad
hoc L2—norm regularization (where the regularization strength
depends on the variable frequencies). It is then possible to per—
form the cluster expansion around this Gaussian reference
model, i.e. the expansion of S — So, where S0 is the cross—entropy
for a Gaussian model

so : llogdetM, M, : —p"" TM” , (10)
2 W
in the Ising (binary) case. If So is a reasonable approximation
of S, then the expansion of S — So may converge more rapidly
than the expansion of S alone. See Cocco and Monasson
(2012) for further details on the expansion of the Gaussian
model.

2.4 Refinement with Boltzmann Machine

Learning (BML)

In cases where convergence of the cluster algorithm alone is not suf—
ficiently fast, it is often more expedient to use the output set of fields
and couplings as starting values for a Boltzmann Machine Learning
(BML) routine. In typical cases, provided that the inferred model is
not too sparse, this procedure can lead to rapid convergence of the
model even when the starting error is large.

Here, we adapted the RPROP algorithm for neural network
learning (Riedmiller and Braun, 1993) to the case of Potts models.
Given an input set of fields and couplings, we first compute the
model correlations hWCoz), pycw, b) through Monte Carlo simula—
tion. The couplings and fields are then updated according to the gra—
dient of the posterior, multiplied by a parameter—specific weight
factor

11
W. b) a W. b) — (pg-“(m b) — ma. b>)w1-,-<a. b). I I
Regularization can also be incorporated by adding 2v],-,-(a,b), or
the analogous term for fields, to the gradient. Here, the weights w,-
(a) and wii(a,b) are also updated with each iteration of the algo—
rithm. At each iteration, if the sign of (pycw) — pi(a)) is the same
as in the previous round, 101(4) —> gun-(a), else 101(4) —> s_w,-(a),
and similarly for the wii(a, b). This acceleration of weight param—
eters allows appropriate step sizes to be chosen adaptively for each
coupling and field. To prevent steps sizes from becoming too large
or too small, the weight parameters are restricted to lie between
some wmin and wmax. Typical choices of the weight bounds and up—
date multipliers are wmin : 10—3, wmax : 10, 5+ : 1.9, s_ : 0.5.
Note that we choose 5+ < 1/5_ so that, if the sign of one of the
terms of the gradient continually switches, the corresponding
weight decreases.

ACE

 

As with other BML approaches, this procedure is computation—
ally limited by the need to thermalize the system to accurately esti—
mate the model correlations through MC. Each MC step requires a
computation of the change in energy due to a change in the configur—
ation x, requiring 0(n) operations, where n is the typical ‘neighbor—
hood’ size (i.e. number of sites to which another site couples with
nonzero ],-,-(a,b)). Future refinements could improve the speed of
this routine by implementing, for example, adaptive selection of the
number of thermalization steps and more efficient Monte Carlo
sampling techniques.

3 Results

3.1 Description of test data and their preprocessing
Here, we apply ACE to five different datasets and test the recon—
struction of their statistics. First, we generate artificial data from a
Potts model with random fields and couplings, allowing us to test
the ability of the algorithm to recover the true model parameters.
Second, we infer a Potts model from artificial sequences generated
by a 3 X 3 X 3 lattice protein model with large folding probabilities
in a given structure. This folding probability (Shakhnovich and
Gutin, 1990) contains all—order interactions between amino acids,
unlike the Potts model used for the inference, thus serving as an
interesting benchmark test (Jacquin et al., 2016). Third, we study
trypsin inhibitor protein sequences (Cocco et al., 2013; Ekeberg
et al., 2013, 2014; Morcos et al., 2011) to compare structural pre—
dictions obtained by ACE to ones obtained using Gaussian (DCA)
and pseudo—likelihood (plmDCA) methods. We then test the ability
of the algorithm to infer a model describing the HIV nucleocapsid
protein p7. Finally, we study multi—electrode recordings of neural ac—
tivity in the prefrontal cortex of a rat (Peyrache et al., 2009) ana—
lyzed in Tavoni et al. (2015) to study memory replay.

3.1.1 Potts models on Erdo's-Rényi random graphs (EROS )

We consider an example of a Potts model with q : 21 states, where
the network of interactions is described by an Erdos—Rényi random
graph with N: 50 variables. Each edge in the interaction graph is
included with probability 0.05. Field and coupling values for inter—
acting pairs of sites are selected from a Gaussian distribution
(Supplementary Materials). We compute the correlations through
Monte Carlo sampling of B : 104 configurations. In the results
shown below we compressed rarely—observed Potts states with 1),-(a)
< 170 : 0.05 and used v : 1/B : 10‘4, performing the inference in
the gauge of the compressed Potts state.

3.1.2 Lattice protein model (LP 53)

We consider an alignment of 5 X 104 protein sequences with N : 27
sites, arranged in a 3 X 3 X 3 cube, selected according to their
exactly computable (Shakhnovich and Gutin, 1990) folding prob—
ability SB (see (Jacquin et al., 2016), Supplementary Materials). In
the results below we have removed amino acids that are never
observed (i.e. compression with pa : 0), and used the regularization
v : 5 / B : 10‘4. Couplings and fields corresponding to the least fre—
quently observed amino acid at each site are gauged to zero.

3.1.3 Trypsin inhibitor protein family (PF00014)

We study an alignment of 4915 sequences downloaded from the
PFAM database for the trypsin inhibitor protein family
(PF00014, PFAM 28.0 release, May 2015). After removing columns
with > 50% gaps the number of sites is N : 53. We reweight the con—
tribution of each sequence to the correlations according to its

similarity to other sequences in the alignment, an approach commonly
used to attenuate phylogenetic correlations (Morcos et al., 2011).
Here, we show results in the consensus gauge after compressing
rarely—observed amino acids with 1),-(a) < 170 : 0.05, using
y : 2/ B : 10‘3. Additionally, we note that gaps in the MSA are not
generally modeled well in the Potts model representation with pair—
wise interactions, as they tend to be present in long stretches, espe—
cially at the beginning and the end of the alignment (Feinauer et al.,
2014). Such stretches of highly correlated gaps slow down the infer—
ence procedure because they give rise to large clusters. Here, we have
processed the data to replace gaps by random amino acids with the
same frequency as observed in the non—gapped sequences. Though
this approach obscures the important variability in the sequence
lengths in the MSA, it is a simple way to reduce computational prob—
lems induced by correlated gaps, valuable for structural prediction.

3.1.4 HIV p7 nucleocapsid protein

The HIV nucleocapsid protein p7 plays an essential role in multiple
aspects of viral replication (Freed, 2015 ). We downloaded a MSA of
4131 p7 sequences from individuals infected by clade B viruses from
the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV sequence database (www.
hiv.lanl.gov, accessed October 6, 2014). After removing columns
with > 95% gaps, the remaining number of sites is N :71. Here,
we do not reweight sequences by similarity, given that they are all in
the same phylogenetic cluster, and the regular observation of similar
sequences in the HIV population may be indicative of higher fitness
(Ferguson et al., 2013; Shekhar et al., 2013). We replaced gaps as
described above, compressed rarely—observed amino acids with
fs : 90%, and chose y 2 1/23 : 1.4 X 10‘4. Inference is performed
in the consensus gauge.

3.1.5 Multi-electrode recordings of cortical neurons

We divided a 20 minute recording of the firing activity of 32 cortical
neurons into a set of B : 1.5 X 105 time bins of 10ms, treating each
time window as an observation of the system. During each time win—
dow, the variable for each neuron i was assigned x,- : 1 if the neuron
was active at least once during that time, and zero otherwise. Here,
we take v : 1/B : 6.6 X 10—6.

3.2 Convergence of the cluster expansion algorithm

As mentioned in Section 2.1, for each threshold t used to select clus—
ters in the ACE expansion, the model individual (xi(a)) and pairwise
(xii(a,b)) frequencies are compared to the data’s frequencies 1),-(a)
and p,,-(a, b). We define a relative error as the ratio between the devi—
ations of the predicted observables from the data, 5(xi) :  — p,-
and 5(xii) : (xii) — 17,7, and the expected statistical ﬂuctuations due
to finite sampling, 517,-(a) : x/p,(a)(1 —p,-(a))/B, 517,701, b)
: Mpg-(a, b)(1 — p,,-(a, b))/B. We define the normalized maximum

error as

 

2m X ,, 1 I5<xi(a))I I5<xi'(avb)>I
Emax— 3 {1.1.4217} rwwzlog(M)( 5171.01) 7 (Sp/1701b) ) (12)

where M is the total number of one— and two—point correlations.
Figure 1 shows the behavior of emax and the cross—entropy as a
function of the threshold for the five datasets described above. The
cross—entropy S approaches a constant value as the threshold is
decreased. In all cases except for the lattice protein model, the algo—
rithm converges at emax ~ 1, when the correlations are reproduced
to within the expected error due to finite sampling. The expansion
slows dramatically for the lattice protein model at a fairly high value
of the threshold due to the large number of states included at each

site in the model (typically q : 19). The computational cost of calcu—
lating the partition function is a limiting factor as the maximum
cluster size increases, corresponding to Kmax : 7 at the stopping
point in Figure 1. At this point BML is needed to refine the param—
eters inferred through the cluster expansion. Note that, even in cases
when the error appears large, convergence of the BML procedure is
often rapid because only small changes to the parameters may be ne—
cessary to obtain a model that accurately reproduces the
correlations.

Convergence of the algorithm can also be more difficult for
alignments of long proteins or those with very strong interactions.
In such cases one may observe large oscillations in the cross—entropy
as a function of the threshold, and large ( 2 10 sites) clusters may
appear even at high thresholds. Strong regularization (y > 1/B) can
help to dampen these oscillations, after which it can be returned to
zl / B during the BML procedure.

3.3 Parameters of the ER05 model are recovered by
ACE

In Figure 2 we show that the 2 X 104 underlying parameters for the
ER05 model corresponding to the explicitly modeled Potts states are
accurately recovered by ACE. These states are better sampled and
therefore they have smaller statistical uncertainties. In the model
inferred by plmDCA, which includes no reduction in the number of
states, there are around 106 parameters. Those corresponding to the
explicitly modeled states are recovered fairly well (with some errors
in the fields), but parameters corresponding to compressed states are
difficult to infer due to insufficient sampling (see Supplementary
Materials for details and analysis of errors in inferred parameters
due to finite sampling).

3.4 Statistics of the data are accurately reproduced
Figures 3 and 4 show how the model inferred by ACE reproduces
the statistics of the input data. In all cases the model accurately
captures the input probabilities and pairwise connected correl—
ations within the expected error due to finite sampling, as
anticipated.

We also find that higher order correlations in the data can be
accurately reproduced. Figure 4 shows the 3—point connected cor—
relations and the distribution P(k) of Hamming distances [2 be—
tween the sampled configurations and the configuration in which
each site takes on the most probable value (i.e. the consensus se—
quence for proteins). In the neural case the most probable config—
uration is the silent one and therefore P(k) is the probability to
have [2 active neurons in the same time window. Models inferred
by ACE outperform those from plmDCA (Ekeberg et al., 2014),
see Figure 3 and Supplementary Materials for higher order
statistics.

ACE

 

Comparing the distribution of energies E for configurations
sampled from the inferred model to the distribution obtained from
the original data provides an additional check of statistical consist—
ency. The energy of a configuration is proportional to the logarithm
of its probability (in addition, because the entropy S is obtained
from the cluster expansion, we can also compute the constant of
proportionality). Concordance between the inferred and empirical
energy distributions thus indicates that the real data could plausibly
be generated from the inferred model. Figure 5 compares the data
and model distributions of energies, showing that in most cases they
closely overlap. A small discrepancy is introduced in PF00014 be—
cause of the reweighting procedure (here, the histogram of the data
is normalized by the sequence weights). The energy distribution for
the lattice protein model is broader than for the data, though the
peak is fit correctly. In contrast with models inferred using ACE, the
distribution of energies of the data is less well reproduced with
plmDCA (Supplementary Materials). The ability to estimate the
probability of a configuration can be useful when comparing the
likelihood of a configuration in two different models, for example to
decide which family a given protein belongs to.

Fig. 6. (a) Contact map for PF00014 inferred by ACE. Here, we show the top
100 predicted contacts, with true predictions in orange and false predictions
in blue. Other contact residues in the crystal structure are shown in gray. For
true positives and other contact residues, close contacts (<6A) are darkly
shaded and further contacts (<8A) are lightly shaded. The upper and lower
triangular parts of the contact map give predictions for the inferred model
with strong regularization/no compression (71:1) and weak regularization/
high compression (y : 2/B), respectively. (b) Precision (number of true pre-
dictions divided by the total number of predictions) as a function of the num-
ber of contact predictions for close contact residues that are widely separated
on the protein backbone (iij > 4). Results using ACE compare favorably
with those from DCA (Morcos et al., 2011) and are competitive with those
from plmDCA (Ekeberg et al., 2014)

3.5 ACE accurately infers structural contacts

for PFOOO 1 4

In Figure 6, we use the inferred couplings to predict pairs of residues
that are in contact in the folded protein structure for PF00014, and
we compare results from ACE to the standard contact prediction
methods DCA (Morcos et al., 2011) and plmDCA (Ekeberg et al.,
2014). In this case the pairs of sites for which the Frobenius norm of
the couplings is largest, including the average product correction
(APC, see (Dunn et al., 2008)), are predicted to be most likely to be
in contact. We define contact residues to be those that are within 6A
of each other in the folded structure of the protein, and we exclude
trivial contact pairs along the protein backbone (i — j S 4).

The accuracy of contact predictions with ACE can be increased
by decreasing the compression (p,7 : 0) and using a large regulariza—
tion (1) : 1), in the same spirit as the strong regularization employed
in typical DCA and plmDCA approaches. Here, we gauged the par—
ameters for the least frequently observed amino acids to zero and
computed the Frobenius norm of the couplings in the zero sum
gauge (as is typical in DCA). The couplings are then strongly
damped by regularization and the cluster expansion converges for
maximal cluster sizes much smaller than those needed in the case
with weaker regularization. Figure 6b shows that the precision in
this case is competitive with the one obtained from plmDCA, and
the prediction of the first ~30 contacts is slightly better for ACE.
However, in this case we note that because of the small values of the
couplings the generative properties of the inferred model are lost
(see Supplementary Materials for the statistical fit of the model).

4 Discussion

Potts models have been successfully applied to study a variety of bio—
logical systems. However, the computational difficulty of the inverse
Potts problem, i.e. the inference of a Potts model from correlation
data, has presented a barrier to their use. Here, we presented ACE, a
ﬂexible, easy—to—use method for solving the inverse Potts problem,
which can be applied to analyze a wide variety of real and synthetic
data. We also provide tools for automatically generating correlation
data from multiple sequence alignments (MSA), making the analysis
of this type of data even more accessible.

Here, we have adapted the complexity of the inferred Potts mod—
els to the level of the sampling in the data. This is achieved by re—
grouping less frequently observed Potts states into a unique state
(according to a threshold on entropy or frequency), then by a sparse
inference procedure that omits interactions that are unnecessary for
reproducing the statistics of the data to within the error bounds due
to finite sampling. On artificial data we verified that compression of
the number of Potts states allows for a faster and more precise infer—
ence of the uncompressed model parameters while reducing overfit—
ting. The methods of compression that we describe here can also be
applied to other inference methods (including, for example, the
DCA and plmDCA approaches discussed above), a topic of future
study. In addition, as described above ACE yields sparser models
when sampling is poor, leading to more robust inference.

This method allows for the simple construction of models from
various types of data, which can then be used to predict the evolution
of experimental systems and their response to perturbations. Previous
work has demonstrated promising applications of such models in a
variety of different biological contexts. In neuroscience, the analysis of
multi—electrode recordings has led to models that identify cell assem—
blies, which are thought of as basic units of neural computation and
memory (Hebb, 1949; Peyrache et al., 2009; Tavoni et al., 2015).

J.P.Barton et al.

 

Studies of MSAs of protein families allows for the prediction of pairs
of residues in contact in the folded protein structure, giving insights
on the protein structure from sequence information alone. Classical
protein folding algorithms can be then used to refine the structure
from contact predictions (Hopf et al., 2012; Marks et al., 2011;
Sulkowska et al., 2012). Potts models have also been used to describe
the mutational landscape of viral and bacterial proteins, where they
provide information about the effects of mutations on protein func—
tion, which could potentially be exploited to improve vaccine design
and drug treatment (Barton et al., 2015; Ferguson et al., 2013;
Figliuzzi et al., 2016; Mann et al., 2014).

In the present work, we have compared ACE with standard max—
imum entropy inference methods based on Gaussian and pseudo—
likelihood approximations. These methods are particularly fast and
adapted to find structural contacts and use, respectively, large pseu—
docounts and regularizations. Inference with ACE is generally
slower than mean—field and pseudo—likelihood approaches.
However, it allows for the accurate inference of underlying model
parameters (when they are known), and for the construction of good
generative models of the data when using a Bayesian value of the
regularization strength (y z 1 /B). In analogy with DCA and
plmDCA, when using ACE with little compression (e.g. p,7 : 0) and
strong regularization the contact prediction obtained using trad—
itional contact estimators is improved while the generative power of
the inferred model is degraded. A recent work has also shown that a
BML algorithm can be used to give a good generative model predict—
ing the structure and functional dynamics of proteins (Sutto et al.,
2015 ). Running such algorithms from a good initial guess of param—
eters, such as those obtained by ACE as shown here, could help to
accelerate the inference procedure.

An additional advantage of ACE is that it evaluates the entropy
of the Potts model corresponding to a given set of data. For protein
sequence data, this entropy gives a measure of the variability of the
sequences in the same protein family, and can be used to predict
site—dependent variability and robustness with respect to mutations
(Barton et al., 2016). We have now successfully applied the method
to protein sequences of a few hundred amino acids in length col—
lected from phylogenetically distant organisms, or longer sequences
(up to 500 amino acids) for more phylogenetically related and less
variable HIV proteins.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Compilation of genetic maps combined to quantitative
trait loci (QTL) meta-analysis has proven to be a powerful approach
contributing to the identification of candidate genes underlying
quantitative traits. BioMercator was the first software offering a
complete set of algorithms and visualization tool covering all steps
required to perform QTL meta-analysis. Despite several limitations,
the software is still widely used. We developed a new version
proposing additional up to date methods and improving graphical
representation and exploration of large datasets.

Availability and implementation: BioMercator V3 is implemented
in JAVA and freely available (http://moulon.inra.fr/biomercator)

1 INTRODUCTION

Integration of multiple independent QTL mapping experiments is
of major interest to unravel genetic factors underlying complex
traits. As a ﬁrst step, a consensus map is built from independent
QTL maps and, if available, the organism reference map. QTLs
are then projected onto the consensus map and subjected to meta-
analysis (Gofﬁnet and Gerber, 2000). As a result, meta-QTLs and
mapped genes lie on the same consensus map, greatly simplifying
the inventory of candidate genes. In addition, the conﬁdence interval
(CI) of a meta-QTL is often shorter than CI of corresponding QTLs,
decreasing the number of candidate genes to consider or the extent
of ﬁne mapping to conduct. In a survey of ﬂowering-time traits
in maize, 62 meta-QTLs were identiﬁed (Chardon et al., 2004)
including one corresponding to VGTl, which was subsequently
Cloned in the predicted region by ﬁne mapping (Salvi et al., 2007).
As map compilation and QTL meta-analysis are not based on
genotyping raw data or trait measure, they can be easily achieved
from maps available from the literature or databases.

The BioMercator software (Arcade et al., 2004) offers a complete
set of analysis and visualization tools dedicated to these approaches
and is widely used (Blackman et al., 2011; Chang et al., 2011;
Quraishi et al., 2011) but suffers several limitations. We propose
here a major upgrade of the software to overcome algorithm and
graphical user interface limitations; map compilation can now be
achieved in a single step whatever the number of maps, there is no
limitation to the number of meta-QTL per Chromosome and the code

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

was rewritten to support high-density maps with no limitation of the
number of loci.

2 COMPILATION OF GENETIC MAPS

The previous versions of BioMercator proposed an iterative map
compilation method, which required at least 11 — 1 steps to integrate 11
maps. The process could be fastidious for a large number of maps and
in addition did not ensure optimality of consensus map. A one-step
procedure to compile 11 maps based on weighted least squares and
described in Veyrieras et al. (2007) is now available in BioMercator.
To assist user in examining the extent of shared loci between maps,
we have implemented a graphical comparative map viewer, which
highlights inverted loci.

3 QTL META-ANALYSIS

The meta-analysis method implemented in BioMercator 2.1 suffered
several limitations. Only models from 1 to 4 meta-QTLs per
Chromosome were considered, possibly forcing user to iterate meta-
analysis process several times to fully cover a Chromosome. In
addition, Classiﬁcation of QTL into meta-QTL was discrete despite
in some cases it would have been more realistic to take into account
the uncertainty in assignation of a given QTL to two or more meta-
QTL. Methods and code (Veyrieras et al., 2007) addressing these
issues have been included into BioMercator V3; among the new
functionalities are ﬁill Chromosome meta-analysis and probabilistic
Clusterization of QTLs. QTLs from related traits can be jointly
subjected to a single meta-analysis by grouping corresponding traits
into meta-traits. User may deﬁne meta-traits with any combination
of traits looking relevant to him.

As an alternative or complement to meta-analysis, Chardon
et a1. (2004) have introduced the ‘QTL overview’ analysis, which
summarizes QTL information by estimating the probability of
identiﬁcation of a QTL along the consensus map. BioMercator V3
automatically computes these probabilities, which are represented
as a curve along the Chromosomes.

4 DATA REPRESENTATION

The datasets to be handled by BioMercator, if not carefully
represented, can quickly overload the display as experienced in the
previous version. New compact graphical representations have been
developed; (i) a Chromosome cascading zoom replaces the simple
scale Change of the previous version; this zoom allows the user
to enlarge a region of Chromosome as deep as he needs, while
keeping an overview of the whole Chromosome map. (ii) When
compiling several maps into a reference one, QTLs may stack in

representation of QTLs (left map), QTL density curves (one by trait) and QTL overview curve (all traits, right map). (C) Meta-analysis output; meta-QTL are
drawn within chromosome and QTL-CI is colored according to the probability of its belonging to meta-QTLs; an enlarged region is displayed on the right
along the full chromosome. The dataset used is maize maps collected by Chardon et al. (2004). Traits are silking date (brown), days to pollen shed (black)

and plant height (orange)

some regions and occupy a really large space, impairing whole map
representation (Fig. 1). To address such cases, a new QTL track
summarizing QTL data along the chromosomes has been developed.
Basically, this track is a curve depicting QTL density that may be
weighted or not by R2. (iii) For whole map representation, each
chromosome can be enlarged independently at the user convenience
in order to focus on regions of interest. By default, for a lighter
display, only a randomly selected set of loci is represented at whole
chromosome scale. By zooming in progressively, more loci are
displayed. However, an option forcing the display of all loci is
available. Datasets as well as analysis output may be exported in
several formats (tabulation-delimited text ﬁle, xml). Either whole
genome map or single chromosome can be exported in JPEG PNG or
the useful SVG vectorial format allowing image editing in dedicated
third-party software.

5 FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

Genetic maps and genome sequence are now integrated for many
species. It would be a great enhancement for end-user if the structural
and functional annotations of regions underlying QTL and meta-
QTL could be reached directly from BioMercator.

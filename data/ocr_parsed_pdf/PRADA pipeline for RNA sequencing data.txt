annotated by sample name, 5’ and 3’ gene name, chromosome location
and blastn homology scores (see below).

The supervised fusion screen module General User dEfined
Supervised Search (GUESS) was developed to facilitate rapid detection
of a single fusion, e.g. FGFR3-TACC3 in GBM (Singh et al., 2012).
GUESS screens BAM files for the presence of discordant read pairs
and fusion-spanning reads of specific genes defined by the user. We
have developed two variants of GUESS, one that searches for fusion
transcripts involving two given genes (GUESS-ft) and one that searches
for intragenic fusions (GUESS-if), such as the EGFR vIII variant that
deletes exons 277.

To allow filtering of homology artifacts from the results of the fusion
module and GUESS-ft, the similarity of two fusion partner genes is
assessed using BlastN. Metrics provided are bitscore and its
associated E—value, where an E—value of >0.001 is considered to be
non-homologous.

The frame module predicts whether a fusion transcript is in frame
and thereby capable of producing a functional protein, based on the
combinatorics of the transcript(s) in the Ensembl database for the
genes involved.

3 RESULTS

3.1 The Cancer Genome Atlas unsupervised fusion results

We used PRADA to process RNA—seq data from 416 renal clear
cell carcinoma (ccRCC) samples and 164 glioblastoma multi—
forme (GBM) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). Among 84 predicted gene fusions in 416 ccRCCs
were 5 SFPQ—TFE3 transcripts, and the overall validation rate
was 85% (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013).
Fusions found in 164 GBMs (n=229) included recurrent re—
arrangements such as the previously reported FGFR3—TACC3
in 2 samples and EGFR—associated fusions in 11 samples
(Zheng et al., 2013). Data from whole genome sequencing, avail—
able for a subset of the GBM, validated 41 of 49 predicted fu—
sions (84%). A T FG—GPR128 fusion was observed in both renal
and GBM samples.

3.2 Supervised detection of TFG-GPR128

A germ line copy number variant involving T FG and GPR128
has been described in human population cohorts (Jakobsson
et al., 2008). Using the GUESS—ft supervised fusion search
module, we evaluated the presence of T FG—GPR128 fusions in
321 TCGA tumor—adjacent normal tissues from 11 cancer types
(Supplementary Table S1). T FG—GPR128 fusion was detected at
low levels in 3 of the 321 normal samples (Supplementary Table
S1). The matching tumor sample of two of three T FG—GPR128
harboring normals also expressed this fusion construct, corro—
borating its germ line status.

3.3 Correlation of RPKM values with U133A microarray
expression levels

We tested the RPKM functionality of PRADA’s expression
module in the context of subtype classification using 164
RNA—seq samples from GBM, comparing its subtype stratifica—
tion with that based on U133A array data. The comparison
showed a high (80.9%) concordance rate in subtype calls for
expression data generated by the two platforms

(Supplementary Table S2), a similar percentage classified reliably
as previously reported (Verhaak et al., 2010).

3.4 Comparison of fusion transcript detection by PRADA,
Defuse and Tophat-fusion

To evaluate PRADA fusion detection accuracy, we obtained
RNA—seq data and whole genome sequencing data of the U87
glioma cell line. PRADA detected 11 fusions, 6 of which related
to DNA structural rearrangements, TopHat—fusion (Kim and
Salzberg, 2012) predicted 42 fusions of which 12 validated in
DNA, while Defuse (McPherson et al., 2011) found 51 fusions
of which 12 related to DNA lesions (Supplementary Text and
Supplementary Table S3).

4 DISCUSSION

The power of PRADA is based on (i) its scalability, (ii) its map—
ping to both transcriptomic and genome, a distinctive feature of
PRADA in comparison with other RNA analysis tools such as
Tophat—fusion and Defuse, which rely on alignments of partial
reads to identify gene fusions, (iii) its modularity and (iv) its
comprehensive repertoire of output information from the incor—
porated modules. It enables the user to compute multiple ana—
lytical metrics using one software package and to do so for large
numbers of samples at once in a fully automated fashion. It has
been tested on thousands of RNA—seq samples from a wide var—
iety of tumor types and normal tissues in TCGA. PRADA is
designed to be run out of the box with little configuration, and is
compatible with PBS and LSF compute clusters. A single
PRADA tarball, including binaries of the packages it relies on,
a comprehensive and detailed manual, and test FASTQ/BAM
files, are freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/prada/

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Novel tools need to be developed to help scientists
analyze large amounts of available screening data with the goal to
identify entry points for the development of novel chemical probes
and drugs. As the largest class of drug targets, G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) remain of particular interest and are pursued by
numerous academic and industrial research projects.

Results: We report the first GPCR ontology to facilitate integration and
aggregation of GPCR-targeting drugs and demonstrate its application
to classify and analyze a large subset of the PubChem database. The
GPCR ontology, based on previously reported BioAssay Ontology,
depicts available pharmacological, biochemical and physiological pro-
files of GPCRs and their ligands. The novelty of the GPCR ontology lies
in the use of diverse experimental datasets linked by a model to
formally define these concepts. Using a reasoning system, GPCR
ontology offers potential for knowledge-based classification of individ-
uals (such as small molecules) as a function of the data.

Availability: The GPCR ontology is available at http://www.bioas-
sayontology.org/bao_gpcr and the National Center for Biomedical
Ontologies Web site.

1 INTRODUCTION

Most drug targets are receptors expressed on the cell surface.
Approximately half of those are G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs), a class of seven transmembrane domain receptors.
GPCRs remain the most pursued drug targets by academic
and pharmaceutical groups (Lagerstrom and Schioth, 2008).
Recently, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Molecular
Libraries Program (MLP) set out to enable large-scale screening
capabilities to identify new drug targets and novel chemical
probes (Austin et al., 2004). GPCRs were among targets included
in high-throughput screening (HTS) campaigns run in the MLP.
The resulting large-scale data were deposited in the public reposi-
tory PubChem. The diversity of these data has highlighted the
need for standards to describe HTS datasets to simplify their

integration, searching and analysis. Here, we describe an inte-
grated GPCR ontology to aid in aggregating and classifying
small molecules based on the results from many screening
campaigns into relevant categories including undesirable artifacts
or promiscuous molecules and sought-after selective and func-
tionally active compounds as entry points for probe and drug
development projects.

The GPCR ontology describes pharmacology, biochemistry
and physiology of individual GPCRs inclusive of receptor struc-
ture, pharmacologically relevant receptor mutations, tissue
distribution, oligomerization and binding afﬁnity of GPCR lig-
ands. Standardized formal descriptions of bioassay targets and
screening results facilitate analysis (Schiirer et al., 2011).
Populating ontology with existing data from public repositories
enables capture of GPCR-ligand data, categorization and search-
ing the data by various terms: for example, receptor type,
biological activity or chemical properties of ligands.

Publicly available repositories of GPCR-ligand interactions
include PubChem (HTS and follow-up screening results from
>4000 bioassays from the NIH MLP program of which ~720
target GPCRs) (Wang et al., 2009), Psychoactive Drug Screening
Program afﬁnity values database (PDSP Ki Db, http://pdsp.med.
unc.edu/), GLIDA @PCR-hgand Qtabase) (Okuno et al.,
2006), IUPHAR (repository of characterization data for
GPCRs, ion channels and nuclear hormone receptors from the
International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology)
(Sharman et al., 2011), GPCR Oligomerization Knowledge
Base (GPCR-OKB, computational and experimental informa-
tion on GPCR oligomerization) (Khelashvili et al., 2010) and
GPCRDB (collection of GPCR sequences, ligand binding con-
stants and mutations) (Horn et al., 2003), among others.
Although the scientific community perceives these resources as
useful, they are not well integrated for the purpose of analyzing
HTS data in the context of various characteristics of GPCRs.

The potential of Semantic Web technologies to integrate bio-
logical data and manage knowledge has been recognized for
some time (Antezana et al., 2009; Pasquier, 2008); this is particu-
larly relevant for areas of rapidly evolving knowledge such as
chemical biology and drug discovery where these technologies
are now increasingly applied (Wild et al., 2012). Ontologies are
formal representations of knowledge and offer distinct advan-
tages (over relational databases) to integrate diverse data from
different sources (Martinez-Cruz et al., 2012). As of September
2013, there are 390 ontologies hosted by the Open Biomedical

Fig. 1. GPCR ontology design for integration of GPCR-related informa-
tion found in public repositories

Ontologies initiatives (126 ontologies) (Smith et al., 2007) and the
Bioportal (National Center for Biomedical Ontologies, NCBO,
354 ontologies) (Rubin et al., 2006), some of which have become
a standard for annotating biomedical data, for example, the
Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000), which describes
cell components, molecular functions and related biological pro-
cesses. However, currently there is no ontology to describe
GPCRs and GPCR-targeting chemical probes and drugs as
outlined earlier in the text.

BioAssay Ontology (BAO) (http://bi0assayontology.org/) was
recently developed to describe and annotate HTS assays and
screening results from the MLP (Vempati et al., 2012). The
GPCR ontology is intended to work together with BAO and
will be integrated as a BAO module. However, it can also be
used independently to describe/query structure, function and
pharmacology of GPCRs and their ligands. This GPCR ontol-
ogy formalizes knowledge related to structural and functional
characteristics of the receptors and their ligands by making use
of description logic and Web Ontology Language (OWL) as
recommended by the W3C (Antoniou and Harmelen, 2009).
The development, scope and applications for screening data in-
tegration and analysis of the ﬁrst version of an ontology on
GPCRs that standardizes and merges several available resources
is reported (Fig. 1).

2 METHODS

2.1 GPCR ontology

The GPCR ontology was developed in OWL 2.0 using the knowledge
modeling environment Protégé 4.2. OWLViz and OntoGraph were used
for visualization in combination with Pellet as an appropriate description
logic reasoning engine. The ontology was primarily constructed at the
knowledge level (domain expert-driven) and incorporated information

from various public GPCR resources listed earlier in the text (data-
driven) (Breitman et al., 2007). The GPCR ontology currently consists
of 904 classes, 345 individuals (imported from IUPHAR), 17 object prop-
erties (relations) and 19 data properties. To incorporate existing ontolo-
gies, ensure interoperability and use ‘consistent and unambiguous formal
deﬁnitions of the relations expressions’ (Smith et al., 2005), we imported
core relations/object properties from the SemanticScience Integrated
Ontology (SIO) (Dumontier, 2013). Likewise, relevant biological
processes and molecular functions were imported from GO; definitions
and gene symbols were added as annotation properties from the Protein
Ontology (Natale et al., 2011) where applicable. The ontology will be
maintained as a module of BAO, which is currently undergoing a
major revision.

2.2 PubChem assay annotation

We iteratively annotated 407 PubChem assays (352 protein target assays,
3 process target assays, 52 summary assays) with >100 descriptor terms
from BAO (Vempati et al., 2012). HTS assays that interrogate GPCRs,
regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) and G proteins as assay targets
were a speciﬁc focus of this project. These proteins are part of the GPCR
signaling cascade and may be pharmacologically important (Tuteja,
2009). BAO annotations were captured in an Excel spreadsheet, quality
checked and loaded into a triple store (Visser et al., 2011). A local mirror
of the PubChem database was created to readily compute on the large
screening datasets (endpoints) and to readily associate the data with the
detailed assay annotations. All assay preprocessing, curation and anno-
tation processed followed previously validated and described approaches
(Schijrer et al., 2011).

2.3 Calculation of compound promiscuity

To illustrate the utility of the GPCR ontology, compounds were classiﬁed
based on screening activities against different GPCR target types (namely
aminergic, peptidergic and lipidergic). A promiscuity index based on data
in PubChem (PCIdx) was calculated for each compound in these cate-
gories. A Pipeline Pilot (Accelrys) protocol was developed to query the
relational database for the purpose of identifying in how many assays
each compound was tested and in how many assays it was found active.
This was done for all assays with meta target: molecular target: protein
target deﬁned as follows: GPCR, G protein or RGS (3S2 AIDs total;
PubChem Assay IDentiﬁer - AID). To identify ‘active’ compounds, we
used previously deﬁned outcome from PubChem. PCIdx was calculated
as the ratio of the number of assays in which a compound was ‘active’
and the number of assays in which it was tested. The larger the ratio of
‘active’ assays to assays tested, the higher a compound’s PCIdx. PCIdx
was calculated separately for single concentration and concentration-re-
sponse assays.

2.4 Data aggregation and classiﬁcation of mechanism of
action based on GPCR ontology and BAO classes

Rule-based classiﬁcation protocols were developed to illustrate applic-
ability of the GPCR ontology. BAO/GPCR ontology concepts were
used to elucidate the compound mechanism of action by ﬁltering and
aggregating assay data. The aggregation was based on relationships of
assays in a screening campaign, assay stage, assay measurement through-
put quality and other relevant categories (Fig. 2). Screening campaign
refers to a set of assays performed to identify a compound with a desired
efﬁcacy and mechanism of action. Assay stage describes the order of
assays in a screening campaign used to identify and ﬁlter results. Assay
measurement throughput quality categorizes the quality of the results
based on tested concentration (single or concentration response) and
number of replicates. Detection technology describes the physical
method used to record/detect the effect caused by the perturbagen in

the assay environment. Molecular target reﬂects a protein (or nucleic
acid) modulated by a perturbagen. Filters can be adjusted based on a
desired type of analysis.

Analysis was initially performed per single screening campaign with
compound categories deﬁned as follows: an ‘active’ compound was one
reported efﬁcacious in primary and confirmatory assays annotated in the
class assay stage in the ontology and activity outcome ‘active/probe’ in
PubChem. These compounds were classiﬁed further, namely by activity
in alternate confirmatory assays (using alternate assay detection technol-
ogy) and counterscreen/selectivity assays (using targets other than
primary/confirmatory assay). Again, activity here was arbitrarily assigned
as a PubChem outcome, but can be modiﬁed to include speciﬁc cutoff
values (e.g. IC50< 10 uM). An ‘active’ compound tested in an assay with
alternate technology and found having activity was termed ‘functionally
active’ (conﬁrmed active). A compound lacking activity in this alternate
conﬁrmatory assay was classiﬁed as ‘non-functionally active OR artifact’
(Fig. 2). A ‘target selective’ compound was an ‘active’ compound found
to be lacking activity in a secondary assay using an alternate target; an
‘active’ compound that did have activity in an alternate target assay was
termed ‘unselective OR artifact’ (also encompassing promiscuous com-
pounds) (Fig. 2).

The ontology was applied to aggregate screening results and classify
compounds based on the highest quality of results. Results were obtained
and merged by substance identiﬁer (SID) to append all data, producing a
ﬁle with tags for the different activity categories. Assay measurement
throughput quality was used as a measure of conﬁdence for each category.
For example compounds were tagged with a selectivity category of ‘+1’
for selective compound and ‘—1’ for unselective compound and an evi-
dence score based on the conﬁdence of the assay results in a screening
campaign. Results presented here were based on data with highest
conﬁdence.

Next, the compound categories were aggregated across screening cam-
paigns to generate ‘global’ compound category proﬁles and to identify
compounds with relevant activity patterns. A Pipeline Pilot protocol was
written to do the following: gather all compound category annotations,
merge them across campaigns based on the same SID, compute statistics
of the respective categories and their conﬁdence and classify compounds
based on these results. Speciﬁcally, global selectivity and promiscuity
(described earlier in the text) scores were generated and relevant com-
pounds were further categorized by the type of GPCR they targeted
(peptidergic, lipidergic or aminergic). Using the scores generated previ-
ously, ‘global’ selective and ‘global’ promiscuous compounds were iden-
tiﬁed. Categorization parameters assured (i) that a ‘global’ selective
compound was active at the same target family across various campaigns
and (ii) that a ‘global’ promiscuous compound was active across multiple
screening campaigns with different targets. Note: a ‘global’ promiscuous

yields insight into the most potent, selective and promiscuous compounds
across the different GPCR families. Similarly, functionally active com-
pounds were characterized across multiple campaigns.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Ontology construction and scope

To create the GPCR application ontology, we first carefully re-
viewed the currently existing ontologies in the NCBO BioPortal
for information on GPCRs. Except for term definitions
(National Cancer Institute Thesaurus, http://ncit.nci.nih.g0V/)
and placeholder for individual GPCRs [Protein Ontology
(Natale et al., 2011) and BAO (V empati et al., 2012)], no granu-
lar GPCR-focused ontology exists that encompasses the pro-
posed features of herein described ontology.

The GPCR ontology provides a framework to link important
information about GPCRs and their ligands (Figs 3 and 4,
Table 1) with the goal to relate receptors to small molecule
and other ligands based on receptor and ligand characteristics
(Supplementary Figs SlsS4). The ontology encompasses GPCR
categories including receptor type, biological process, receptor
signaling, receptor physiological and molecular function,
GPCR ligand and others (Fig. 3). These broad categories are
then thoroughly detailed by GPCR attributes captured in the
ontology as placeholders (example - source), such as: class
(Class A - IUPHAR), family (opioid receptor - IUPHAR),
species [Homo sapiens (Hs) s IUPHAR], receptor identiﬁcation:
Protein ID [P35372 (Hs) s UniProt], gene ID [4988 (Hs) - Entrez
Gene], taxonomy ID (9606 - NCBI Taxonomy), primary

sequence (FASTA sequence string - protein sequence/NCBI),
cellular component of receptor localization (integral to plasma
membrane - GeneOntology/cellular component), tissue
distribution (CNS - IUPHAR), physiological function (pro-
tein binding - GO/molecular function), receptor structure
(4DKL - PDB). With respect to receptor signaling, the signaling
pathway (primary versus secondary/IUPHAR), signaling path-
way transducer (G alpha i/o family - IUPHAR), signaling path-
way effector (adenylate cyclase - GO/biological process) and
signal transmission (second messenger signaling - IUPHAR)
are captured. With respect to oligomerization, the Oligomer com-
ponent (heteromer or homomer - OKB) and oligomer’s physio-
logical relevance (ligand binding - OKB) are included.
Furthermore, GPCRs are classiﬁed according to the type of
ligand they bind, either endogenously or most prevalently
(peptidergic - IUPHAR) (Supplementary Fig. S1) (van der
Horst et al., 2010).

The GPCR concepts (Fig. 3) are modeled in the ontology
using several relations, some of which are imported from SIO
(Dumontier, 2013). For example, GPCR ‘has_receptor_type’
some ‘receptor type’, ‘is_located_in’ some ‘cellular component’
and ‘is_located_in’ some ‘tissue’. GPCR ‘is _part_of some ‘oligo-
mer’, ‘is _participant in’ some ‘biological process’ and
‘has_functi0n’ some ‘receptor function’; GPCR ‘binds_to’ some
‘PCR ligand’, ‘is participant in’ some ‘bioassay’. The class
‘GPCR’ also uses data properties: ‘has gene symbol’, ‘has

NCBI taxonomy ID’, ‘has protein sequence’, ‘has species’
(Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S1).

GPCR ligands are described by various ligand characteristics
including ligand chemical type (aminergic, lipidergic, synthetic
small molecule, etc.) and mode of action (agonist, antagonist,
etc.). Information captured as placeholders to external resources
further includes ligand endpoint (IC50 - IUPHAR/PubChem/
BAO), ligand afﬁnity value (0.25 - PubChem), ligand afﬁnity
unit (uM - PubChem/BAO), ligand indication (endogenous,
promiscuous, radioactive - IUPHAR), ligand type (synthetic
small molecule - DrugBank), clinical adverse effects (potential
risk of heart attack - Food and Drug Administration Adverse
Event Reporting System, http://www.fda.g0V/) and ligand’s
mechanism of action (pure opiate antagonist - DrugBank)
(Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S2). We also plan to map terms
from the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ontology
(Degtyarenko et al., 2008) to further classify GPCR ligands.
Object properties connect ligand to receptors and other classes
Via axioms such as ‘GPCR ligand’ ‘binds_to’ some GPCR,
‘has_ligand_type’ some ‘ligand chemical type’ and ‘has_attribute’
(SIO) some ‘ligand characteristic’. Data properties include ‘has
CAS registry number’, ‘has chemical formula’, ‘has InChI’,
‘has SMILES’, ‘has PubChem ID’, ‘has molecular weight’ and
‘has IUPAC name’ (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S2).

As one example of linking important ligand and receptor
properties, the ontology deﬁnes what (chemical) types of

(endogenous) ligands each receptor type binds. These are asso-
ciated with corresponding receptor types thus enabling inference
(T-box reasoning) of different receptor categories as illustrated
for aminergic receptors in Supplementary Figures S3 and S4.

3.2 Data integration

Although BAO describes HTS experiments and their associated
results, including ligand binding and functional characteristics
(such as allosteric, competitive, irreversible or agonist, antagonist
efﬁcacies, etc.), it lacks important details of GPCR binding and
functional assays. The GPCR ontology was developed as an
extension of BAO, but it can also be used independently to
facilitate integration of different GPCR-related data sources. It
allows users to interpret GPCR screening results more compre-
hensively with the potential to infer molecular mechanisms of
action. The ontology can be obtained at http://www.bioassayon—
tology.org/bao_gpcr and the NCBO BioPortal and will also be
integrated with BAO.

3.3 GPCR bioassay activity data content

To demonstrate identification of GPCR-targeting chemical
ligand space Via data integration, we performed analysis on
this family of receptors. GPCRs activated endogenously or by
an exogenous ligand undergo a conformational transformation
followed by an exchange of guanosine diphosphate to guanosine
triphosphate. GPCR signaling is modulated by various effectors:
G proteins, GPCR kinases and arrestins, as well as GTPase
accelerating proteins of which RGS are a group. We chose
assays with RGS and G protein as assay target for two reasons.
First, these targets are important modulators interrelated in the
GPCR signaling cascade (Huang and Tesmer, 2011). All are
involved in GPCR signaling and interfering in this cascade is
one way of effecting a desired pharmacological outcome.
Second, there is a large number of PubChem assays targeting
these proteins (GPCR: 285 AIDs, G protein: 34 AIDs, RGS:
33 AIDs). RGS are accelerators of signal suppression and have
roles in cardiovascular, immune and metabolic functions (Hurst
and Hooks, 2009). Drugs targeting RGS could act as potentia-
tors of agonist action, desensitization blockers of exogenous
GPCR agonists, specificity enhancers of exogenous agonists or
antagonists of effector signaling Via an RGS protein (Zhong and
Neubig, 2001). For example, inhibitors of RGS8 (0r RGS7 0r
RGS4) could serve as novel analgesics or analgesic potentiators
(Zhong and Neubig, 2001). Similarly, a drug affecting the action
of RGS complex, RGS-RhoGEF, (a RGS domain coupled to
guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates Rho
protein), could potentially block the effects of S1P on cancer
initiation and tumor vascular maturation (Hurst and Hooks,
2009).

The level of detail captured in assay annotations is exempliﬁed
in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1. The annotated assays
related to G protein, RGSs and GPCRs were further classiﬁed
and counted according to various BAO classes such as protein
target, detection technology, measured entity, endpoint and mech-
anism of action (Supplementary Tables S2sS6). Brieﬂy, protein
target refers to the speciﬁc protein whose perturbation by inter-
action with a screened compound is measured in the assay.
Measured entity is a molecular entity that is the output of a

biological reaction or process and that is detected either directly
(by the presence of a tag or probe) or indirectly in a coupled
reaction. Endpoint is the ﬁnal experimental results quantifying or
qualifying a given perturbation (e.g. IC50, percent inhibition)
(Vempati et al., 2012). Mechanism of action reflects the effect
of the compound on the target in an experiment.

3.4 NIH MLPCN probes for the GPCR/RGS receptor
family targets

The main goal of the NIH MLP project was ‘to identify chemical
probes to study the functions of genes, cells and biochemical
pathways’(Austin et al., 2004). As of December 10, 2012, 193
probes were identiﬁed from various screening campaigns. Of
these, 49 probes targeted GPCR, RGS or G proteins
(Supplementary Table S7, http://mli.nih.gov/mli/mlp-probes-2/).

3.5 Data Analysis using GPCR ontology

3.5.] GPCR ligand types and promiscuity Using the BAO/
GPCR ontology class-based assay annotations, the assays were
ﬁrst categorized by GPCR type (aminergic, lipidergic or pepti-
dergic) followed by computing promiscuity statistics for each
compound. The analysis was performed separately for single
concentration and concentration-response data. The promiscuity
index is listed in Table 2 for the topmost promiscuous com-
pounds in each category (Note: most of these compounds also
show activity at non-GPCR targets).

For example, in the peptidergic GPCR-binding group of com-
pounds, SID 14729216 with PCIdx of 0.9, is a methylbenzylsul-
ﬁnyl-substituted pyridine that binds to various receptors (S1P2R,
NPSRl, S1P4R or MlR) as an antagonist. The functional
groups of this compound ﬁt non-speciﬁcally into variety of
GPCR binding sites. Overall, there were 931 data points for
aminergic GPCR type with PCIdx30.l, and 9873 and 8981
data points for peptidergic and lipidergic GPCR type with
PCIdx 3 0.1, respectively. Supplementary Figure S5 depicts com-
plete dataset of compound promiscuity per GPCR type. (A re-
ceptor abbreviation list is available in the Supplementary Table
S2 legend).

3.5.2 Analysis of individual single screening campaigns A rule-
based aggregation of GPCR ligand activity data was developed
and implemented to identify various categories of active com-
pounds within each screening campaign (see ﬂow chart Fig. 2).
Overall, there were 73 different screening campaigns that
targeted GPCR, G proteins or RGS (Supplementary Table
S8); some campaigns were merged during analysis due to assay
overlap (e.g. FPRl and FPR2 screening campaigns included
assays that were counter screens for each respective target) and
some were omitted due to lack of annotated data. For each of
these campaigns, several analyses were performed to classify
compounds into the following categories: ‘active’, ‘functionally
active’, ‘non—functionally active OR artifact’, ‘target selective’
and ‘unselective OR artifact’ (Fig. 2). Examples of identiﬁed
compounds for different categories are listed in Table 3.
Interestingly, some of the SIDs identiﬁed in our analysis are
also conﬁrmed MLP probes (asterisk, probe; Table 3)
(Supplementary Table S7). Examples of ‘functionally active’
compounds include the 5-HT(1A) agonist (SID 856021),

S1P4R antagonist (SID 22409370) or M5R allosteric ligand (SID
85285486), all with high potencies (Table 3; compound structures
in Supplementary Table S9). These compounds were conﬁrmed
to be active in secondary assays with alternate technology (e.g.
immunoassay versus calcium redistribution assay). Compounds
inactive in assays featuring the same target assessed with differ-
ent technology were most likely artifacts. To address selectivity,
compounds were screened in assays featuring various homolo-
gous and non-homologous targets. Those inactive in such assays
were deemed ‘target selective’ and examples of those include
screening campaign probes: FPRl antagonist (SID 24428139),
NPY-Y2R Antagonist (SID 22413249) and S1P1R Agonist
(SID 4258673). ‘Unselective OR artifact’ category of compounds
includes compounds active in assays with targets other than that
of primary interest. Examples of these include compounds
screened in the following campaigns: M1R Antagonist (SID
17415263), AVPRlA Agonist (SID 85200865) and RXFP2
Agonist (SID 11532956). Detailed screening information pertain-
ing to a target-selective compound identiﬁed within a screening

campaign is given in Table 4. SID 24428139 has been screened in
multiple assays in the ‘Formyl Peptide Receptor Antagonists’
campaign. It has been tested against FPRl and FPR2 in ﬁve
different assays [primary (AID 722), conﬁrmatory (AID 724),
counter (AIDs 723 and 725) and alternate conﬁrmatory (AID
863)]. It has been found ‘active’ at FPRl and ‘inactive’ at FPR2
and was determined by the assay provider to be a probe for this
screening campaign. Formyl peptide receptors are GPCRs
involved in mediating immune response to infection by acting
as potent chemoattractants for neutrophils (Dufton and Perretti,
2010).

3.5.3 GPCR ligand analysis across screening campaigns The
GPCR ontology was leveraged in combination with BAO to
aggregate and categorize compounds screened across multiple
campaigns. Activity categories corresponding to individual
screening campaign outcomes were aggregated and analyzed by
SID as described in Methods to generate ‘global’ compound
proﬁles. The ‘global’ activity map (Fig. 5) illustrates the different

‘Global’ aggregated scores are shown for the different categories reﬂect-
ing selectivity and functional activity. Promiscuity is the negative select-
ivity score, size indicates the aggregate conﬁdence score and color
corresponds to the number of screening campaigns (increasing from

light to dark). Representative structures and data are in Supplementary
Table 812

cross-campaign proﬁles for compounds that were identiﬁed as
selective or promiscuous in at least one campaign.

Supplementary Tables S10 and S11 show full details of the
most pronounced compounds corresponding to each category.
SID 7966282 was identiﬁed as the most selective compound (top
left in Fig. 5). It was tested in 28 campaigns and 42 assays, ren-
dering it the most selective compound. This compound was
active at 5-HT1E receptors and inactive at a number of different
GPCRs of all types (aminergic: 5HT1A, DRD2; peptidergic:
NTSR, NPYlR, NPY2R, OT, FPR2, NPBWRl, Gal2, APJ;
lipidergic: S1P1R, S1P3R, S1P4R, PTGER2, among others).
This compound scores in the ‘artifact’ range because it does
not have alternate conﬁrmatory assays except for one in which
it was found inactive (AID 485270). Likewise, SID 844845 is a
high-quality selective compound (top left in Fig. 5). It was tested
in 28 campaigns, 43 assays and found active against 1 family of
GPCRs: the 5HT1E. It was inactive at peptidergic GPCRs
(NTSR, NPYlR, NPY2R, OT, OX, APJ, CCR6 and
NPBWRl) as well as lipidergic (S1P3R, S1P4R) and hormoner-
gic (TRHl) GPCRs (Table 5).

SID 49827544 was identified as the most promiscuous com-
pound (bottom left in Fig. 5). It was tested in 12 campaigns, 20
assays and was found active in 15 assays including alternate

campaigns, 48 assays and has activity at numerous GPCR
families (large circle, lower left quadrant in Fig. 5). It has inhibi-
tory activity at lipidergic (S1P1R, S1P4R, PTGER2), aminergic
(M1) and peptidergic (NPSR, Gal2, NPBWRl, APJ, opioid,
AGTR) GPCRs (Table 5 and Supplementary Table S12).

It should be noted again that herein reported results are inclu-
sive of data pertaining only to GPCRs, RGS and G protein
targets. Some compounds have reported activity outside of this
group of receptors. For example, SID 14729216, the promiscu-
ous compound across GPCR screening campaigns, is also active
at other non-GPCR targets [e. g. heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70),
E3 Ligase, etc.]. BAOSearch (http://ba0search.ccs.miami.edu/)
enables a full View of each compound’s activity.

4 DISCUSSION

GPCRs continue to remain a ‘hot’ target of research as new
structural information, signal processing pathways and large-
scale compound screening results become validated and available
(Manglik et al., 2012; Granier et al., 2012; Thompson et al., 2012;
Wojciak et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2012). Acquired data come with
challenges of integration and analysis to derive new knowledge.
Here, we report GPCR ontology to facilitate integration of vari-
ous GPCR resources. The GPCR ontology includes relevant
classes and relations to characterize and link receptors and com-
pounds that are known binders or show activity on GPCR-
related assays. To more effectively disseminate biological data
on GPCRs with the goal to drive innovation involving biologists,
chemists and bioinformaticians requires a ﬂexible framework to
integrate GPCR data from various resources.

To enable identification of novel GPCR probe and drug lead
candidates Via more efﬁcient data integration and analysis, we
ﬁrst researched and then aggregated available and relevant
GPCR pharmacological data sources. GPCR target and ligand
features are captured in the ontology to enable more versatile
and integrative Views on GPCR function. For example, classify-
ing different ligand types based on chemical structure/compos-
ition (amine, peptide and lipid) as well as different receptor types
(aminergic, peptidergic and lipidergic) can guide compound li-
brary design to maximize structure7activity relationship (SAR)
studies; we have illustrated how the major receptor categories
can be inferred. Ligands are also classiﬁed based on their efﬁcacy
at a particular GPCR (full agonist, allosteric modulator, etc.)
yielding insight into selective agonism issues that are becoming
more apparent in GPCR pharmacology (Gesty—Palmer and
Luttrell, 2011). In addition, ligands are grouped based on their
indication (endogenous, promiscuous and radioactive) and the
type of the receptor they interact with. For example, ligand S1P
is classiﬁed as a full agonist, endogenous, lipid compound tar-
geting the class A, lipidergic, lysophospholipid family of S1P
receptors.

To illustrate use of the GPCR ontology the activity of screened
compounds was categorized based on assay details (stage, tech-
nology, detection, alternate targets, etc.) and receptor informa-
tion (type, class, etc.). The query to identify how often a
compound has been screened against a given type of GPCR-
facilitated calculation of receptor type-specific promiscuity. For
example, SID 14729216 was tested in 10 assays targeting pepti-
dergic GPCRs and was ‘active’ in 9 of them (PCIdx=0.9).

Categorization of compound data into various activity groups
(‘functionally active’, ‘target selective’, ‘non—functionally active’
and ‘unselective’) across a single campaign illustrates how the
GPCR ontology can be applied. The process included sorting/
tagging the data based on conﬁdence of each data point and
using only the highest quality results. Analysis was performed
within and across screening campaigns to identify the most inter-
esting and relevant compounds according to several categories.
The identiﬁcation of known MLP probes, in addition to many
other compounds that are potential probe or drug development
candidates, validates our approach (‘target selective’ category)
(Table 3). Compounds not tested in confirmatory assays were
filtered out in the analysis pipeline ensuring only high quality
likely replicable outcomes were used for the cross campaign cat-
egorization. Relaxing the conﬁdence score may thus identify
many additional potentially relevant compounds.

Promiscuity calculations and compound categories were per-
formed using a rule-based system, in contrast to reasoning, be-
cause we wanted to report statistics and consider conﬁdence of
assay results, but also because of the difﬁculty to reason across
large datasets.

The GPCR ontology enables additional levels of analytical
complexity, e.g. tissue expression. Linking receptor and tissue
expression pattern is another example (among many others) of
how the ontology adds value by enabling integration of data
sources; this would allow inferring if a compound acts at a re-
ceptor in the brain versus another (peripheral) tissue, thus
enabling quick identiﬁcation of potential brain penetrable prop-
erties. Analyses as described earlier in the text can be performed
for any concept/class in the GPCR ontology.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We present the first GPCR ontology framework to describe
functional, structural and physiological aspects of GPCRs and
pharmacological and other characteristics of related small mol-
ecule acting on the receptors. This GPCR ontology facilitates
integration of different resources and provides a new framework
to maximize the value of the HTS datasets by bridging the gap
between the overﬂow of HTS data and the bottleneck of inte-
grated analysis. We will make these data available Via the
BAOSearch (Abeyruwan et al., 2010) software application that
facilitates search and exploration of screening data based on
various categories from the BAO and chemical structures.

Semantic Web technologies show great promise to link diverse
biological data as demonstrated, for example, by the Bio2RDF
project (Belleau et al., 2008). Our hope is that this ontology will
facilitate incorporating mentioned GPCR resources and in par-
ticular the actual screening results into linked data projects with
the goal to develop better tools for drug development projects by
more effectively ‘repurposing’ already generated datasets.

A future goal is to expand the semantic model to facilitate the
integration of screening data with biological pathways, disease
networks and structural biology with the goal to analyze screen-
ing results in the context of molecular mechanisms of action.
This approach offers the potential to generate new knowledge
by inference (using a reasoning engine). The development of
additional ontologies modules is currently underway.

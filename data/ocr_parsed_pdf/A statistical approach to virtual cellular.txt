Abstract

Motivation: We address the following question: Does inhibition of the expression of a gene X in a
cellular assay affect the expression of another gene Y? Rather than inhibiting gene X experimen—
tally, we aim at answering this question computationally using as the only input observational
gene expression data. Recently, a new statistical algorithm called Intervention calculus when the
Directed acyclic graph is Absent (IDA), has been proposed for this problem. For several biological
systems, IDA has been shown to outcompete regression—based methods with respect to the num—
ber oftrue positives versus the number of false positives for the top 5000 predicted effects. Further
improvements in the performance of IDA have been realized by stability selection, a resampling
method wrapped around IDA that enhances the discovery of true causal effects. Nevertheless, the
rate of false positive and false negative predictions is still unsatisfactorin high.

Results: We introduce a new resampling approach for causal discovery called accumulation IDA
(alDA). We show that alDA improves the performance of causal discoveries compared to existing
variants of IDA on both simulated and real yeast data. The higher reliability of top causal effect pre—
dictions achieved by alDA promises to increase the rate of success of wet lab intervention experi—

ments for functional studies.

1 Introduction

Understanding of the complex molecular networks underlying cellular
processes is the key challenge of systems biology. Here, we focus on
gene regulatory networks. Interpreting these networks causally re-
quires a direction of information flow. Given a causal network, the
most basic question is: IfI perturb gene X, what happens to gene Y?
Of course, this question can be answered experimentally by inhibiting
X, e.g. by PCR-based gene deletion strategy (Baudin et (11., 1993;
Watch, 1996), RNA interference (Fire et (11., 1998), or CRISPRi
(Larson et (11., 2013) screening, and observing Y. We here discuss to
what extend the same question may be answered in a virtual way, i.e.
without the need to perform a cellular perturbation experiment.

A high-throughput version of this problem would be the following:
Find all pairs of genes (X a Y), where perturbing X affects Y. We
refer to this causal data mining approach as causal discovery.

Statistically, the challenge is to estimate causal effects between
random variables from purely observational data. For gene expres-
sion data the causal effect of gene X on gene Y can be defined as the
number of units gene Y changes in expression, if the expression of
gene X is experimentally altered by one unit. Causal Networks are a
well established statistical framework for analyzing this problem
(Pearl, 2000).

In causal transcriptional networks the nodes of a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) are random variables representing genes and their

expression values. A directed edge from X to Y denotes that the ex—
pression of X causally and directly influences the expression of Y.
Consequently, the expression of Y is determined by the expression
of its parents in the network. If the causal network is known, Pearl’s
do—calculus allows estimating the strength of the causal effects be—
tween pairs of random variables from observational data
(Goldszmidt and Pearl, 1992; Pearl, 1995). However, causal tran—
scriptional networks are largely unknown. Multiple statistical algo—
rithms have been established to estimate the undirected skeleton of a
network from conditional independence tests (Huynh—Thu et al.,
2010; Margolin et al., 2006). The PC algorithm (Kalisch and
Buhlmann, 2007; Spirtes et al., 2000) allows to define the direction
of some edges allowing for a causal interpretation of the network.
The network cannot be fully directed because different networks
with identical skeletons can encode the same conditional independ—
ence assumptions and thus can not be distinguished on observational
data only (Verma and Pearl, 1991).

Recently, Maathuis et al. (2009) introduced the Intervention cal—
culus when the Directed acyclic graph is Absent (IDA) algorithm,
which combines partial estimation of the network with the estima—
tion of lower bounds for causal effects between genes. They prove
consistency of the bounds (Maathuis et al., 2009) and show in appli—
cations that IDA outperforms regression—based methods in terms of
number of true positives versus number of false positives for the top
5000 predicted effects on the transcriptome of yeast gene deletion
strains from a large dataset of expression profiles of wild type yeast
(Maathuis et al., 2010). However, in simulations with large net—
works and medium sized datasets, which are typical for many biolo—
gical applications, networks often cannot be reconstructed correctly.
Stekhoven et al. (2012) suggest using stability selection
(Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2010), a subsampling strategy that is
wrapped around IDA as a remedy. In fact, their CStaR algorithm
outperforms plain IDA with respect to true positive selections versus
false positive selections (Stekhoven et al., 2012).

Here we propose an alternative subsampling strategy in combin—
ation with a modification of the IDA algorithm called accumulation
IDA (aIDA). Our method represents an improvement over CStaR,
IDA, and regression based methods as demonstrated for both simu—
lated and two yeast datasets.

2 Causal discovery

2.1 Causal transcriptional networks

We represent transcriptional causal networks by DAGs consisting of
nodes X : X1, ...,X,, and edges E : E1, ...,E5. Every gene is repre—
sented by one node in the network. Statistically, every node is a ran—
dom variable whose values indicate the expression levels of a gene.
We further assume that the variables follow a multivariate Gaussian
distribution. Edges represent conditional dependencies; nodes that
are not connected represent variables that are conditionally inde—
pendent. Moreover, we interpret the edges causally. If there is a dir—
ected edge X —> Y, we assume that an experimental perturbation of
the expression level of X will affect Y, but not vice versa. A DAG
fully specifies the conditional dependencies of all nodes (Pearl,
1988), but not vice versa. Several DAGs with the same skeleton of
undirected edges and the same v—structures (Pearl, 2000) encode the
same conditional dependency structure (Verma and Pearl, 1991).
These equivalence classes of DAGs can be represented by completed
partially directed acyclic graphs (CPDAGs) that consist of the joint
skeleton and the directed edges which are common to all DAGs in
the equivalence class (Chickering, 2002).

2.2 Causal effects

In a hypothetical perturbation experiment we may increase the random
variable X by one unit (X)—>X + 1) and observe the effect on a second
variable Y. If Y is changed by Y)—>Y + I}, we call I} the causal effect of
X on Y. Given a causal network and a dataset of joint observations of
the nodes X, Pearl’s do—calculus (Goldszmidt and Pearl, 1992; Pearl,
1995) provides guidelines how to estimate causal effects I} for all pairs
of nodes. In the Gaussian case one can use a linear regression of Y on
X and a set of additional nodes Z that fulfill the Back—door criterion
(Pearl, 2000), a criterion that only depends on the topology of the
underlying causal network. A set of variables Z satisfies the Back—door
criterion relative to an ordered pair (X, Y) in a DAG G, if

i. no node in Z is a descendant of X.
ii. Z blocks (see Supplementary Section 1) every path between X
and Y that contains an arrow into X

(Pearl, 2000). It can be shown, that the true parents of a node X do
always fulfill the Back—door criterion relative to every ordered pair
(X, Y) (Pearl, 2000). In Figure 1A the set of nodes {2,3} fulfills the
Back—door criterion relative to the ordered pair (6,10). In addition,
the set {4,7} fulfills the Back—door criterion relative to the ordered
pair (6,10), while for example the set {4} does not fulfill the Back—
door criterion, because the path (6 ,3,7,10) remains unblocked.

Let Z : (Z1, . . . ,Zk) be a set of nodes fulfilling the Back—door
criterion, and let I} : [30480132], . .. ,ﬁz/ be the least squares fit of
the linear regression

Yzﬁo+ﬁxX+Zﬁzzi+a (1)

then ﬁx is a consistent estimator of the causal effect of X on Y
(Maathuis et al., 2009). Z adjusts the regression for possible con—
founders that affect X and Y simultaneously, thus creating spurious
correlations between X and Y. An example for an adjustment set Z
that satisfies the Back—door criterion of a node X with respect to all
other nodes Y is the set of true parents of X.

2.3 IDA and CStaR

For transcriptional networks the underlying causal graph is mostly
unknown and needs to be estimated. An obvious idea is to first re—
construct a causal network and then estimate causal effects thereof
using Equation (1). Several algorithms have been proposed to esti—
mate the equivalence class of a DAG from observational data
(Chickering, 2002, 1996; Dash and Druzdzel, 1999; Madigan et al.,
1996; Meek, 1995; Pearl, 2000). IDA uses the PC—algorithm (Spirtes
et al., 2000), which estimates the CPDAG in a two—step procedure.
In the first step, the skeleton and the v—structures of the CPDAG are
estimated by testing for conditional independence. In the second
step, orientation rules are applied (Meek, 1995 ), which exploit the
facts that (i) the network cannot be cyclic, and (ii) that no new v—
structures are found in an equivalence class. A parameter or is used
to calibrate the sparseness of the estimated network. Large values of
or increase the number of edges within a network. Importantly,
increasing or also increases the runtime of the algorithm significantly,
such that one often needs to compromise on the sparsity of the net—
work to keep computations feasible.

The existence of equivalent DAGs complicates the estimation of
causal effects. Maathuis et al. (2009) have demonstrated that it is
still feasible to derive lower bounds of causal effects using their IDA
algorithm. In a computationally elegant and efficient way, IDA enu—
merates all possible parent sets of a node X in a CPDAG, and calcu—
lates causal effects of X on all its descendants using any one of the

Percentage of subsamples that fulfill the backdoor-criterion

Fig. 2. The Back-door criterion is fulfilled frequently even if the PC algorithm
rarely detects the true parents. One thousand cause-effect pairs were
sampled randomly from a network with 1000 nodes. For each of these pairs
we counted how often the Back-door criterion was fulfilled by the estimated
parent sets within the 100 subsamples (black bars) and how often the parent
set was the true parent set (gray bars). The x—axis shows the percentage of
estimated causal effects of this 100 subsampling runs where the Back-door
criterion was fulfilled. The y—axis displays the proportion of the 1000 sampled
cause-effect pairs for which at least x% of the estimated parent sets from the
100 subsampling runs fulfilled the criterion (black) or were the true parent
sets (gray). The detection of true parent sets is a very hard task, but meeting
the Back-door criterion is not

are no strict requirement to calculate causal effects. Certain benign
mistakes do not impede causal effect estimation. If the estimated
parents fulfill the Back—door criterion they yield valid estimates even
if they are not true parents. For a given DAG with edge weights that
represent direct causal effect strengths we can generate artificial
gene expression data (Details are given in the Supplementary
Materials Section 3.1). We generated 50 samples for a random DAG
of 1000 nodes, drew 100 subsamples of size n : 25, and ran the PC—
algorithm as implemented in (Colombo and Maathuis, 2012) on
each subsample, resulting in 100 CPDAGs. From all pairs of nodes
(X —> Y) we calculated the multisets of possible estimated parents of
X. Since we know the correct parents of X in the simulation scen—
ario, we can count how often the PC—algorithm correctly identifies a
parent set. In these cases IDA can derive valid causal effects.
However, finding the correct parent sets is a sufficient but not a ne—
cessary criterion to get valid estimates. In fact, every gene set Z that
fulfills Pearl’s Back—door criterion also yields valid causal effect esti—
mates. In our simulations from known networks (see Supplementary
Material for details on data simulation), we can verify whether an
estimated parent set fulfills this criterion and count how often this is
the case. Figure 2 shows that although estimated parent sets often
are not the true parents, they nevertheless frequently fulfill the Back—
door criterion and will hence generate valid estimates of causal ef—
fects. In other words, finding the true parents is difficult, whereas
obtaining a set of estimated parents satisfying the Back—door criter—
ion is not. For example, in more than 40% of the cause—effects pairs

the Back—door criterion was fulfilled in more than 90% of the esti—
mated parent sets over the 100 subsampling runs, conversely there
were no subsampling runs that contained at least 90% true causal
parent sets. Similar observations can be made when reconstructing
real biological networks (Supplementary Fig. 53). This explains in
part why IDA and CStaR are successful in spite of the poor perform—
ance of the PC—algorithm.

3.1.2 Valid effects generate peaks in the effect histograms

We next used Equation (1) to estimate causal effect sets for all pairs
of nodes (X —> Y) and all estimated parent sets that can be derived
from the CPDAGs. We pool these numbers both across effect multi—
sets and subsampling runs and visualize their distribution in the light
gray histogram of Figure 1B.

The solid curve in Figure 1B is a smoothed density estimate of all
effects from node 6 on node 10 across 100 subsampling runs derived
from valid adjustment sets. We observe a pronounced peak in this
density around the true causal effect (dotted vertical line). This is be—
cause estimates derived from valid adjustment sets Z are unbiased
estimates of the true causal effect and, hence, scatter around it. The
true parents of the cause are always a valid adjustment set, but they
are not necessarily the only one. Valid are all sets that fulfill the
Back—door criterion relative to the cause and the effect of interest.
The dashed curve shows the density of the estimates that are not
derived from valid adjustment sets. This distribution is not centered
around the true effect. Estimates based on invalid adjustment sets
can take any value, and their corresponding distribution is un—
known. Since the Back—door criterion is not a necessary condition
for Z to be a valid adjustment set, some of these estimates might still
be valid but others are not.

If a large fraction of effects is valid, one would expect them to
have similar values centered around the true causal effect, and there—
fore give rise to a peak in the histogram.

This observation is the motivation for the algorithm described
below. The basic idea is to pool effects across multisets and subsam—
pling runs and to use the mode of the smoothed histogram as causal
effect estimate.

3.2 Algorithm

The input of our algorithm is a set of expression profiles consisting
of 17 genes observed in 11 samples. This data is observational, i.e. the
cells were not perturbed. We assume that all samples were drawn
from the same underlying joint distribution of gene expression
levels. The output of our algorithm is an ordered list of triples
(X, Y, C), were X and Y are genes and C is the estimated causal ef—
fect of X on Y. The list is sorted by the absolute value of the effect
strength C.

The algorithm performs the following steps:

1. Randomly draw K subsets of samples of size 1, resulting in K
resampled datasets.

2. For each of these subsets estimate a CPDAG using the PC—algo—
rithm as implemented in Colombo and Maathuis (2012) with
sparseness parameter or, resulting in K CPDAGs on the same set
of nodes.

3. For every ordered pair of genes (X —> Y) extract the multisets M
(X —> Y) of possible estimated parents of X and pool them
across all CPDAGs.

4. For all elements Z of this multiset estimate a causal effect using
the regression model from Equation (1).

5. Generate one histogram of estimated effects per gene pair
(Accumulation step). Smooth these histograms using a Gaussian

an estimate for the causal effect C of X on Y.

6. Collect all causal effects in a p X p matrix. Sort the effects by the
absolute value of C, and output this sorted list.

The algorithm follows CStaR in steps 1—4 but differs from CStaR in
step 5. Step 6 ranks all gene pairs by effect size to achieve results
comparable to CStaR. Since the accumulation idea is added to the
IDA concept, we call our algorithm aIDA for accumulation based
IDA.

4 Results

aIDA and CStaR (Stekhoven et al., 2012) were applied to both simu-
lated datasets and two gene expression microarray datasets from
Sacclmromyces carer/£52216 using the order independent implementa-
tion of the PC algorithm (Colombo and Maathuis, 2012; Kalisch
et al., 2012). For the simulated datasets true causal effects are
known from the simulation process. For the microarray datasets the
target set of causal effects is calculated as described in Maathuis et
al. (2010) from interventional experiments (single knock-out strains,
see details in Section 5.1 of the Supplementary Materials).

4.1 Parameter calibration

aIDA depends on the calibration of several parameters. The most
critical of them is the sparseness parameter 2 of the PC algorithm
(Kalisch and Buhlmann, 2007). Since 2 is shared by aIDA and
CStaR, its calibration does not impede a fair comparison of the
methods. The other parameters were set to the recommended values
from CStaR (see Supplementary Materials Section 6). For the band-
width of the Gaussian kernel we used default values of the density()
function from basic R, since further calibration did not improve ef-
fect estimation. A larger 2 leads to denser CPDAGs and larger multi-
sets. This in turn leads to more regression parameters that need to

data using the higher value of x is more similar to the true distribution of the
number of parents

be estimated from Equation (1), which might increase the standard
error of the effect size ﬁx. We tested the recommended value for x
from the IDA literature but observed for both, the simulated and
real data, that resulting CPDAGs can have very different numbers of
edges in comparison to previous publications. This is further aggra-
vated by a correction of the implementation of the PC algorithm,
which leads to systematically sparser graphs for the same values of
2, especially for graphs with many variables and few observations
(Colombo and Maathuis, 2012).

For the simulated datasets we have calibrated x such that we
obtain CPDAGs with densities similar to the expected density
(Supplementary Figs S4 and S5). The histograms show, that x : 0.5
is a realistic value for 2. Additionally, we show that choosing a
higher value of 2 leads to a better performance (Supplementary Figs
S1 and S2). For the datasets from S.C€l‘€lllsl[l€ we compared the den-
sities to a density derived from a transcriptional regulatory network
published by Balaji et al. (2006) (Figs 3 and 4). We observed that
both alpha :0.01 and alpha : 0.5 underestimate the density of the
network. Although the data suggest using an alpha even above 0.5,
we did not increase it further due to runtime constraints.

4.2 Performance of alDA on simulated data

First, we tested the performance of aIDA on simulated datasets gen-
erated from known causal Gaussian networks. We simulated ran-
dom DAGs of various sizes and augmented their edges with weights
sampled from a uniform distribution on the interval (0.1,1). The
weights represent direct causal effect strengths. For each DAG, we
generated artificial datasets of varying size using the R package
pcalg (Kalisch et al., 2012). Details on the data generation are given
in the supplements, Section 3.1. We use these data to evaluate the
performance of aIDA and compare it to that of CStaR. A compari-
son to plain IDA is not needed, because it has already been shown
that it is outcompeted by CStaR with respect to true positive selec-
tions versus false positive selections (Stekhoven et al., 2012).

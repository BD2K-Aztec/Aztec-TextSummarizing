ABSTRACT

Motivation: Cellular processes are controlled, directly or indirectly, by
the binding of hundreds of different DNA binding factors (DBFs) to the
genome. One key to deeper understanding of the cell is discovering
where, when and how strongly these DBFs bind to the DNA sequence.
Direct measurement of DBF binding sites (BSs; e.g. through ChlP-
Chip or ChIP-Seq experiments) is expensive, noisy and not available
for every DBF in every cell type. Naive and most existing computa-
tional approaches to detecting which DBFs bind in a set of genomic
regions of interest often perform poorly, due to the high false discovery
rates and restrictive requirements for prior knowledge.

Results: We develop SparScape, a penalized Bayesian method for
identifying DBFs active in the considered regions and predicting a joint
probabilistic binding landscape. Using a sparsity-inducing penaliza-
tion, SparScape is able to select a small subset of DBFs with enriched
B85 in a set of DNA sequences from a much larger candidate set. This
substantially reduces the false positives in prediction of B85. Analysis
of ChIP-Seq data in mouse embryonic stem cells and simulated data
show that SparScape dramatically outperforms the naive motif scan-
ning method and the comparable computational approaches in terms
of DBF identification and BS prediction.

Availability and implementation: SparScape is implemented in C++
with OpenMP (optional at compilation) and is freely available at ‘www.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many complex processes in the cell, particularly gene regulation,
are controlled by the binding of various factors to the DNA
sequence. A key to understanding these processes is determining
where each of these DNA binding factors (DBFs), including
transcription factors (TFs), nucleosomes, RNA and other pro-
teins and protein complexes, binds in the genome in a certain cell
type and set of conditions. This collection of binding sites (BSs)
for all DBFs over regions of interest is sometimes called a bind-
ing landscape. More formally, we define a binding landscape as
the base pairispeciﬁc probability of binding for each of a library
of DBFs over a set of genomic regions.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Considering DBFs one at a time leads to many false positives,
both in determining which DBFs have signiﬁcantly enriched BSs
in a set of genomic regions and in predicting the exact locations
of BSs, and results in a limited View of the processes controlled
by these DBFs. This has motivated recent work on jointly pre-
dicting binding landscapes for a set of DBFs. Currently, joint
landscapes at single base pair resolution for all DBFs have only
been predicted in lower eukaryotes such as yeast with fewer
DBFs and much smaller genomes (Wasson and Hartemink,
2009). In higher eukaryotes, predictions have been limited to a
(usually small) pre-selected set of DBFs known to bind the re-
gions of interest (He et al., 2009, 2010; Kaplan et al., 2011;
Laurila et al., 2009; Raveh—Sadka et al., 2009). Of these methods,
only that of He et a]. (2009) does not require the DBF concen-
trations as prior knowledge, something made possible by con-
sidering at most two DBFs at a time, and only Kaplan et a].
(2011) used ChIP-Seq data as a source of direct information. See
Arnold et a]. (2011), Ernst et a]. (2010), Marbach et a]. (2012),
Ramsey et a]. (2010), Teif and Rippe (2010) and Won et a].
(2010) for recent examples of alternate approaches to answering
related questions.

Owing to computational limits, it is impossible to predict a
joint base pairispeciﬁc binding landscape for all DBFs with un-
known concentrations over the entire genome in higher eukary-
otes with large genomes and many DBFs. We are thus limited to
exploring a subset of the genome. One motivating type of gen-
omic subset is a set of regions known to be co-bound by a small
group of DBFs based on ChIP-Seq data. In such a genomic
subset, we do not expect most DBFs to have a significant
number of BSs. Thus, the false positive BSs in a predicted bind-
ing landscape can be substantially reduced if only the DBFs with
significantly enriched binding in the regions of interest are con-
sidered. However, it is limiting to require the complete set of
DBFs enriched in the considered regions to be known a priori
as is done in existing work on similar questions in higher
eukaryotes.

In this article, we develop a method that offers a principled
way to select an, often small, subset of DBFs active in the regions
of interest and to reduce the false-positive signal in the predicted
probabilistic binding landscape, eliminating the need for prior
knowledge of the set of enriched DBFs or DBF concentrations.
In the motivating genomic subset, our method allows for the
discovery of unknown cofactors that commonly bind near the
DBFs with ChIP data (ChIP DBFs). The predicted joint binding
landscape provides a global and quantitative View of the binding
pattern among the DBFs. This is an initial step to the study of
combinatorial regulatory logic among multiple DBFs.

Sparse binding landscapes

 

2 MODEL AND ESTIMATION

2.1 Overview of SparScape

Our method, SparScape, proceeds in two stages. First, from a
candidate set we select the DBFs with signiﬁcant binding in the
considered regions. Second, we do a reﬁned prediction of the
binding landscape considering only the selected DBFs. See
Supplementary Figure S1 for a schematic illustration of the
method.

SparScape takes as input the previously estimated binding
motifs for a set of candidate DBFs, the sequence of a set of
genomic regions of interest and genome-wide binding data (e. g.
ChIP-Seq) for any of the candidate DBFs if available. The set of
regions could be the whole genome when examining small gen-
omes. We consider nucleosome binding because nucleosome oc-
cupancy blocks the binding of many other DBFs, and recent
studies have demonstrated the utility of nucleosome models in
protein binding landscapes (Kaplan et al., 2009; Raveh-Sadka
et al., 2009; Wasson and Hartemink, 2009). We model nucleo-
some binding preferences by a position-speciﬁc Markov model
proposed by Kaplan et a]. (2009). Details are provided in
Supplementary Methods Section S1.1. The binding of non-
nucleosome DBFs is modeled by position-speciﬁc weight matri-
ces (PWMs). The background is modeled by a ﬁfth-order
Markov chain estimated from a large set of sampled or simulated
regions similar to the regions of interest.

We model ChIP data as a set of binary windows, where a
window of base pairs around the center of a ChIP peak is
called a ChIP window for that DBF. In this work, we use
ChIP windows of 50 bp on either side of a ChIP-Seq peak.
Our method estimates the probability that a BS for a DBF
with ChIP data is entirely within one of its own ChIP windows.
This is in the same spirit as the use of DNase I sensitivity meas-
ures to create an informative prior distribution for TF binding
(Kaplan et al., 2011; Narlikar et al., 2007), though SparScape can
exploit binding data for any of the candidate DBFs or the nu-
cleosome. Moreover, ChIP windows are included as part of a
generative probabilistic model with parameters related to the
accuracy and sensitivity of ChIP peaks, resulting in a more prin-
cipled and ﬂexible utilization of ChIP data.

Estimating concentrations is a unique feature of SparScape.
This makes it impossible to exactly calculate the binding land-
scape through forwardibackward summation. Instead, we ex-
plore the posterior distribution through a penalized iterative
sampling approach, simultaneously selecting DBFs, estimating
model parameters and predicting the binding landscape. Note
that concentration here is not related to the physical concentra-
tion of the DBF, but rather summarizes the enrichment of BSs in
the considered regions and gives the probability of a BS begin-
ning at any location in the sequence. One could use physical
concentration measures such as gene expression to build an in-
formative prior on the concentration vector, but we have not
explored this possibility.

Jointly estimating the concentrations introduces a risk of ex-
cessive false positives, especially for DBFs with less informative
motifs where we expect non-functional matches to occur fre-
quently in the genome. To avoid this, we use a penalty on the
predicted site counts in each iteration, penalizing in proportion
to the expected number of false-positive sites estimated with

control regions given the current parameter values. Intuitively,
this removes the expected false-positive sites from the sampled
sites. The level of penalization is controlled by a tuning param-
eter, chosen in the ﬁrst stage through 10-fold cross-validation.
With a proper level of penalization, concentrations of many
DBFs will be estimated as exactly zero, achieving the goal of
DBF selection. The ﬁnal binding landscape, considering only
the selected DBFs, is predicted in the second stage.

When selection and prediction are completed, SparScape re-
ports a binding landscape, which gives the probability of binding
at each base pair by each selected DBF, and the estimated par-
ameter values, including the concentrations for the DBFs. It also
reports the binding conﬁguration and the parameter values
sampled at each iteration, allowing, for example, construction
of credible intervals for the parameters and examination of
high-order interactions between binding at different sites.

2.2 The SparScape model

Consider the sequence S of a set of genomic regions with total
length |S|, and the set of ChIP windows D in these regions for all
ChIP DBFs. Let K be the number of candidate DBFs, and O
denote the set of binding model parameters for all K DBFs,
including the nucleosome, and the background model. Under
the standard steric hindrance constraint, we define a binding
conﬁguration as a partition of the sequence S into unbound
background sites and BSs for the K DBFs. Denote a conﬁgur-
ation by A = (a1, a2, . . . , am), where a,- is the index of one of the
K + 1 models and represents a subsequence of base pairs bound
by a DBF (or is a single unbound base pair) in the current con-
ﬁguration. More speciﬁcally, it represents a single unbound site
covering L0 = 1 bp when a,- = 0, a nucleosome covering
L1 = 147 bp when a,- = 1, and a non-nucleosome DBF from
the candidate library covering Lk bp when a,- = k e {2, ..., K},
where Lk is the length of the motif for the k‘h DBF. Figure 1a
illustrates an example conﬁguration.

Let g) be the probability that a BS for a ChIP DBF is entirely
within one of its ChIP windows and y be the probability that an
unbound base pair is not covered by any of the ChIP windows.
Write d3 = (g), y). Denote by T = (To, . . . , 1K) the probabilities of
initiating a background site (k: 0) and other DBF sites
(k: 1, ...,K) at a given location (Zk‘tk = 1,1;C 3 0). This
can be thought of as a vector of local concentrations (local to
the regions considered).

We wish to jointly estimate the binding conﬁguration A, the
concentrations T and the ChIP parameters d3. Given binding
conﬁguration A, we consider the sequence S and the ChIP win-
dows D as independent sources of information. We further
assume independent priors on T and d3. Under these model as-
sumptions, the joint posterior distribution is

P(dD, T,A|S, D, o) 0( P(S,D,A|®, 01>, T)71(d>, T)

= P(SIA, ®)P(D|Aa ¢)P(A|T)7T(¢)7T(Tla (1)

where P(S, D, A|®, d), T) is the complete-data likelihood, regard-
ing A as missing data. The posterior distribution of A gives the
predicted binding landscape. Our primary goal is to select the
DBFs with motif models in O that have a significant number
of BSs in S and predict the likely binding conﬁgurations.

pairs and binding of DBFs in different types of windows. The triangle
and circle represent BSs for two ChIP DBFs. The vertical bar represents
an unbound site or a BS for a DBF with no ChIP data

We achieve this by assigning a statistical weight based on
Equation (1) to every binding conﬁguration and searching the
space of possible conﬁgurations through Monte Carlo sampling.
Note that different DBFs can bind to the same base pairs in
different conﬁgurations, and thus, our sampling approach
allows relatively large posterior binding probabilities for multiple
DBFs for the same base pair if BSs do overlap.

The ﬁrst part of the statistical weight is the ratio between the
likelihood of the sequence given a conﬁguration A and the like-
lihood given the null conﬁguration A0 where no DBFs are
bound. Let  be the base at position j and nganszndm be the
subsequence in S from the first to last base pairs covered by
element a,- in the A. Define the single-element sequence likelihood
ratio as follows:

P(SStart(i'):End(i')|6k)
P (SStart([):End(i') | 90)

for a,- = k e {1, ...,K}, where 6k is the parameter (e.g. PWM)
for the kth binding model. See Supplementary Methods Section
S1.2 for the detailed formulation. By deﬁnition H0 E 1.

The second part of the statistical weight is the ratio between
the likelihood of the ChIP windows given a conﬁguration A and
the likelihood given the null configuration A0. The background
window is defined as the set of base pairs not covered by any of
these windows. Thus, if we have M ChIP DBFs, we will have
M + 1 sets or types of windows, where windows of type 0 are the
background windows. Let dgjanszndm be the type of the window
covering the element a,. When a,- indicates a ChIP DBF, we
deﬁne

Hk (SStart(i'):End(i')) : 

P(dStart(i'):End(i') : klai : ks  = $2 

P (dStart(i):End(i) =j|ai = k, <15) 2 wk,j(1 — <15): (4)

where wa (1' 75 k) is proportional to the total length of all win-
dows of type j and 21.75,; wa = 1. For background sites
(a,- = k = 0), q) is replaced by y in (3) and (4). The model for a
DBF without ChIP-Seq data is identical to that for background
sites. See Figure 10 for an illustration and Supplementary

Methods Section S1.3 for more technical details. If most of the
ChIP DBF BSs are covered by a corresponding ChIP window,
the parameter ()5 will be close to one. The value of y is determined
mostly by the percentage of the base pairs not covered by any
ChIP windows. We have found that when running SparScape
ignoring the ChIP data, the percentage of predicted BSs within
what would have been ChIP windows had they been considered
tends to be similar across DBFs. Thus, we assume a single par-
ameter ()5 shared among all ChIP DBFs in the current work. See
Kaplan et a]. (2011) and Kharchenko et a]. (2008) for other
models of ChIP data in motif ﬁnding.

With all the terms in Equation (1) deﬁned we can compute the
full likelihood ratio. Deﬁne B(k,€) = P(du/lal- = k, O) with
Z/ = Z + Lk — 1. Then the full likelihood ratio for element
a,- = k in conﬁguration A, starting at sequence position 3 and
covered by a window of type dm, is

£(k,€)=(Tk/T0) Hk(SZZ(Z+Lk*l)) B(kae)/B(0ae)- (5)

Note that when a,- = k = 0, i.e. the ith element is an unbound
base pair, by definition we have [1(0, Z) = 1 for all Z. The product
of [I over a,- deﬁnes the complete-date likelihood ratio,

P(S,D,A|®,q>,1) _ |A| .
P(S,D,A0|o,q>,1) — Lima“ Start(l))- (6)

2.3 Sparsity through penalization

The total number of candidate DBFs K is often large. We seek
DBF selection because we expect that BSs for a large majority of
candidate DBFs are not enriched in the considered genomic
regions. Considering DBFs that are not truly enriched when pre-
dicting the final landscape increases false positive predictions,
sometimes dramatically.

One way to achieve DBF selection is to estimate many con-
centrations 1k as exactly zero, as 1k is the probability of initiating
a BS for DBF k. It can be seen from (6) that the log-likelihood
for T given A is 21:0 Cklog 1),, where Ck is the number of BSs
of DBF k in A. If we take the conjugate Dirichlet prior on T

with prior counts ark >0, for k = 0, . . . , K, the conditional pos-
terior distribution for T is a Dirichlet distribution
Dir(C0 +a0, ..., CK+aK). A sample from this distribution

always has positive components, based on which we cannot con-
struct a sparse estimation of T. Thus, we run our algorithm in the
selection stage for a bum-in period with ark = 1, and then set
ark = 0. If Ck = ark = 0 at some iteration, then the conditional
posterior distribution has a point mass at 1k 2 0. This allows us
to achieve sparsity in the sense that some 1k 2 0 with a positive
probability. DBFs that hit 1k 2 0 at any sampling iteration are
selected out.

Unfortunately, for many DBFs we expect relatively strong
non-functional motif matches to occur randomly, leading to a
non-negligible number of false positive predicted sites such that
1k almost never hits zero. We counteract this false positive signal
with penalty terms on the parameters T and d3, leading to a
penalized complete-data log-likelihood of the form

K

Sparse binding landscapes

 

where Fk 3 0 is the expected count of false positive BSs for DBF
k, A 3 0 is a tuning parameter and p(d>) denotes the penalty for
d). Given the current concentrations, Fk is estimated empirically
from a set of control sequences, possibly simulated, with no
(known) true sites (Supplementary Methods Section S1.4). See
Figure 1b for a schematic of the penalty count and net site count
calculation. We did not penalize the nucleosome concentration
(11) in the results presented here, but SparScape supports such
penalization.

Together with the prior distribution 7r(d>, T), we obtain a
penalized posterior distribution. To understand this penalized
posterior, consider sampling from the conditional distributions
taking the penalties into account. The conditional sampling from
[A|d>, T, S, D, O] is not affected by the penalization and can be
implemented by forward summation and backward sampling
(Gupta and Liu, 2003; Zhou and Wong, 2004). See
Supplementary Methods Section S1.5 for details.

Consider penalized sampling from [d>, T|A, S, D, O]. Let
nk = Ck for k=0,1 and nk = (Ck—AFk)Jr for k3 2, where
x1r = max(0, x). We think of nk as the net site count after dis-
counting for false positives AFk. Then the penalized complete-
data log-likelihood for the concentrations T is 21:0 nk log 1),. If
the penalty AF), 3 Ck for some iteration, then the net site count
nk = 0 and the conditional posterior distribution of T (with
ark = 0) has a point mass at 1k 2 0. Thereafter, we drop DBF
k from further consideration. See Supplementary Methods
Section S1.6 for more details about this conditional sampling
step. Figure 2 shows penalized and unpenalized sample paths
for the concentrations of a true and a false DBF in a simulated
dataset, with more examples in Supplementary Figure S2.
Figure 2a demonstrates that moderate penalization can eliminate
a false-positive DBF even when its concentration would other-
wise stabilize around a highly inﬂated value. While 1k may hit
zero for some false-positive DBFs even with A = 0, as shown in
these figures, there are many cases where DBF selection is
achieved by using a non-zero penalty A>0. Setting the prior
counts ark = 0 is mainly for mathematical rigor so that 1k may
hit zero exactly, as any positive value of ark will never give 1k 2 0
in any sampling iteration. In addition, this choice also avoids the

which would be necessary if ark were positive.

Penalization on the parameters in O is similar. The conditional
posterior distributions for q) and y given A are beta distributions.
The counts in both are related to the site counts inside and out-
side the relevant set of ChIP windows. We penalize the counts for
these beta distributions in the same manner as described above.
Suppose we have sampled Ck sites for DBF k and C2“) is the
count of these sites within a ChIP window of type k. Then the net
site count 11):“) = nk(C)Cm)/Ck) for the inside count, and likewise
for the outside count (Supplementary Methods Section S1.7).

The penalty parameter A controls the level of penalization on
sampled site counts in each iteration of our algorithm. We de-
veloped a method for choosing A similar to the work by Fu and
Zhou (2013) Via 10-fold cross-validation, with details in
Supplementary Methods Section S1.8. The DBFs with a non-
zero concentration in at least 5 out of 10 training sets for the
chosen A are regarded as selected DBFs.

2.4 Landscape prediction

After enriched DBFs are selected, the binding landscape is pre-
dicted considering only the selected DBFs with prior counts
ark = 1. Recall that a ﬁnal run of our iterative sampling algo-
rithm is necessary because with unknown concentrations calcu-
lating binding probabilities exactly through forward-backward
summation is impossible. For an outline of the full algorithm,
see Supplementary Methods Section S1.9.

In the DBF selection stage we penalize the BS counts to en-
courage sparsity in concentration estimation. Overall, the penalty
biases DBF concentration estimates downward and biases the
predicted binding landscape toward higher speciﬁcity and
lower sensitivity. One can increase the sensitivity of BS prediction
in the ﬁnal stage by not penalizing. One may also consider
reestimating PWMs, using previously published PWMs as
prior information. This can increase sensitivity but may result
in minor modes with some concentrations highly inﬂated. In
such cases the landscape prediction with penalized site counts
and ﬁxed PWMs must be used despite the downward bias.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Applications to mouse embryonic stem cell and
simulated data

We investigate two mouse datasets derived from multiple TF loci
(MTL) regions deﬁned in Chen et a]. (2008). In that article, 12
TFs known to play a key role in maintenance of embryonic stem
cells (ESCs) were studied with ChIP-Seq experiments. These 12
TFs are Stat3, Nanog, Klf4, Pou5f1/Oct4, Esrrb, Sox2, cMyc,
Smadl, nMyc, E2f 1, chcp2ll and fo. Two main clusters of BSs
were found, one centered around Oct4 (Nanog, Sox2, Oct4,
Smadl, Stat3) and the other around cMyc (cMyc, nMyc, E2f 1,
fo). We interrogate 1553 MTL regions built around the Oct4
group and 1178 regions built around the cMyc group. ChIP
windows were built around ChIP peaks in these regions.
Mouse ESC gene expression data from Zhou et a]. (2007) were
used to cull the considered DBFs to 170 with non-negligible ex-
pression. The PWMs of the 170 DBFs were extracted from the

TRANSFAC database (Matys et al., 2003). We use SparScape to
nominate novel possible co-factors that act in concert with these
known core TFs in mouse ESCs.

Two simulated datasets, each composed of 1000 simulated
regions, were designed to mimic, respectively, the two mouse
datasets, with a detailed description in Supplementary Methods
Section S1.10. To evaluate performance across a range of sample
sizes, for both the mouse and simulated data, the entire Oct4
group was analyzed together, but the cMyc group was randomly
divided into subsets of 100 regions. DBFs were selected using
only the ﬁrst random subset and binding landscapes were pre-
dicted over all subsets with the selected tuning parameters and
DBFs.

The most comparable method with available software is
COMPETE (Wasson and Hartemink, 2009). COMPETE re-
quires a fixed concentration vector and a pre-selected set of
DBFs as input. We chose the concentration vector following
the tuning procedure outlined in their article. Since the primary
source of information for both SparScape and COMPETE is the
sequence, we also compared against a naive approach consider-
ing the raw binding score at each locus. This raw score is the
ratio of the PWM score over the background model score for a
given w-mer (2).

3.2 Comparing DBF selection

Both COMPETE and the raw score method use only sequence
information and do not use ChIP data like SparScape. To make
a fair comparison, we ﬁrst show that SparScape outperforms
COMPETE and the raw score method when we ignore the avail-
able ChIP data and only use the sequence data. This illustrates
the value of penalization and joint concentration estimation in
SparScape. When the ChIP data are used, SparScape outper-
forms the competitors more dramatically.

To select DBFs using COMPETE, we ranked the DBFs by the
total predicted binding probabilities over all base pairs and chose
rank cutoffs for comparison with other methods. For the raw
score method, when considered separately by locus, the number
of scores for a DBF that exceed a chosen threshold (we used 1000
and 2000) approximately follows a Poisson distribution when
there are no true sites. An expected false-positive count of
scores over this threshold was estimated from control regions
and used as the rate parameter of the Poisson distribution to
ﬁnd a P—Value for the hypothesis that the DBF had no true
sites in the examined regions. We considered three approaches
to controlling for multiple comparisons. Our most conservative
method was the ranking method where we ranked all the DBFs
by their P—Values and considered only the top N, where N is the
number of DBFs selected by SparScape. The next most conser-
vative approach was the use of the standard Bonferroni multiple
testing adjustment to control the family-wise error rate at 5%.
The least conservative approach was controlling the false discov-
ery rate (FDR) at 5%.

In (A), T /N represents T true DBFs out of N DBFs selected. In (B), T /N represents
T ChIP DBFs out of N DBFs selected. For COMPETE, the number of DBFs to
select from the ranked list was chosen to match that of SparScape (the Rank row) or
the raw score method (the Bonf and FDR rows). The Rank row gives ranked results
for the raw score method and COMPETE that match the number selected by SS—
NC. The Bonf row gives selection results using a Bonferroni—corrected P—value
threshold of 0.05. The FDR row gives selection results using an FDR of 5%. CV
indicates that the DBFs were selected via cross—validation by SparScape.

other methods nominate between 4 and 10 times as many pos-
sible co-factors, fewer of which are plausible compared with
those nominated by SparScape. SparScape also did a better job
selecting the DBFs around which the examined regions were
built, selecting three of the ﬁve members of the Oct4 group
and all four members of the cMyc group. When choosing the
same number of DBFs selected by SparScape, COMPETE or the
raw score method selected at best one member of the Oct4 or
cMyc groups in the respective sets of MTL regions.

When regions are analyzed to select target DBFs for lab-based
follow-up experiments, it is of critical importance to reduce the
number of false leads suggested by computational analysis. A
major reduction in false positives in selecting DBFs is a key ad-
vantage of our new method. The substantial improvement over
COMPETE highlights the critical roles of penalizing false posi-
tive counts and estimating concentrations in SparScape.

The joint DBF selection is a key factor in the improved per-
formance achieved by SparScape. To demonstrate this point, we
compared against an individual selection approach under the
same framework of SparSpace but considering one candidate
DBF at a time with the nucleosome. We applied this individual
approach to the cMyc group mouse data with ChIP windows
and ran SparScape 10 times for each DBF with the same A as
chosen in our joint run on that dataset. This individual approach
selected 112 DBFs, 97 of them in all 10 runs, including 9 of the 12
ChIP DBFs. As expected, this result is close to that of the raw
score method (with FDR control). As shown in Table 1, the joint
run selected only 11 total DBFs including 5 ChIP DBFs. This
highlights the huge reduction in the false positives for DBF se-
lection that results from considering all the DBFs together.

In the Oct4 regions, SparScape selected pr219, Egrl/Krox24,
Spl and Nr6a1/GCNF besides the ChIP DBFs. All four have
been identiﬁed in the literature as having some association with

differentiation, ESCs or being key regulators in maintenance of
pluripotency. pr219 and Spl have been identiﬁed as members
of protein interaction networks for pluripotency with Oct4 and
Nanog in mouse ESCs (Kim et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2006).
pr281 has also been identified as a Nanog interacting protein
required for proper cell differentiation (Fidalgo et al., 2011). The
binding motifs for pr219 and pr281 are similar, so it is possible
we are picking up sites for both TFs. Spl was also found to be a
significant co-factor in this same dataset by He et a]. (2009). The
Egr and Sox families have been shown to interact in Schwann
cells (Jessen and Mirsky, 2008). Nr6a1 is required to suppress
Oct4 and recruit co-factors to affect DNA methylation and his-
tone modiﬁcations in the Oct4 promoter during differentiation
(Gu et al., 2011).

In the cMyc group, we proposed six co-factors, Atf5, Erf,
foap, Nrf 1, Spl and thb7b/cKrox/ThPok. Atf4 (with a
nearly identical motif as Ath) has been identiﬁed in a co-expres-
sion and regulation network centered around cMyc (Furuya
et al., 2008). Erf is key in cell differentiation mediated by cMyc
repression (V erykokakis et al., 2007). Nrfl has been shown to
interact with cMyc in regulating apoptosis and implicated as a
key actor in pluripotency maintenance (Mason et al., 2009;
Morrish et al., 2002). Spl interacts with cMyc (Herkert and
Eilers, 2010). thb7b directs the CD4 and CD8 T cell differen-
tiation, while related TFs such as Miz-l are known to cooperate
with cMyc (Kerosuo et al., 2008).

Taken together, we see that SparScape was able to select DBFs
known to bind in the regions of interest and nominate a small
group of likely co—factors for both the Oct4 and cMyc groups.
This can provide investigators with a higher return on experi-
mental validation and follow-up studies.

3.3 The binding landscape and concentration

In the second stage, we predict the binding landscape and esti-
mate concentrations for the DBFs selected in the ﬁrst stage. The
concentration estimates for the selected DBFs (SS in Table 1)
in the mouse and simulated Oct4 group regions are shown in
Figure 3. For the simulated dataset, the ratio between an esti-
mated concentration and the true value ranged from 0.71 to 1.46
for the non-nucleosome DBFs in the penalized run (A = 0.2),
while the concentrations were generally overestimated without
penalization (A = 0) (Fig. 3a). Particularly, the unpenalized esti-
mate for Nanog does not appear in the ﬁgure, as it was massively
overestimated, indicating an enormous number of false positive
predicted BSs. This is a general danger of jointly estimating the
concentrations that can be avoided with proper penalization.
This also explains, at least partially, why the estimated nucleo-
some concentration was lower in the unpenalized run than in the
penalized run. With A = 0, many nucleosome BSs were crowded
out by the false positive sites for Nanog and other DBFs due to
the competing nature between DBF binding in our model.
Furthermore, nucleosome concentration 11 was not penalized
even when A >0 [see Equation (7)]. Figure 3b shows the concen-
tration estimates in the mouse Oct4 group data from a penalized
run with ﬁxed PWMs and an unpenalized run with reestimated
PWMs. Similar patterns are observed as those in the simulated
data.

Concentration estimates are stable over different runs of
SparScape. Supplemental Figure S3 shows a box plot of the co-
efﬁcients of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean)
for the posterior mean estimates of concentrations over 10 inde-
pendent runs of predicting the ﬁnal binding landscape for the
cMyc group data. These ranged from ~zero to just >0.02 for the
11 non-nucleosome DBFs selected by our two-stage run of
SparScape and was <0.05 for the nucleosome.

Examples of predicted binding landscapes are shown in
Supplementary Figure S4. The posterior binding probabilities
summarized there can be used directly in further analyses, but
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by choosing a
posterior probability cutoff for predicting sites. A summary of
results for SparScape and raw score predictions in the simulated
datasets is given in Table 2. COMPETE results are not included
in the table because the highest sensitivity achieved (<0.1) was
so low that the results are not comparable in this format. We
only present results for the DBFs with true sites, ignoring in the
FDR calculations the large number of false-positive DBFs se-
lected by the raw score method and those selected by SparScape.

For each category of DBFs, we chose the raw score cutoff that
gave a similar sensitivity to that achieved by our method at the
given posterior probability cutoff and compared the FDRs.
SparScape reduces the FDR compared with the raw score
method for every category of DBFs across both datasets, achiev-
ing a reduction of 21763% in the Oct4 group data and 13733%
in the cMyc group. In the Oct4 simulation, we achieved an over-
all sensitivity of 0.74 with an FDR of 0.23 as compared with an
FDR of 0.42 for the raw score method with similar sensitivity. In
the cMyc simulation, we achieved a sensitivity of 0.7 and an
FDR of 0.3, compared with an FDR of 0.4 for the raw score
method. The raw score method performed relatively better on
the DBFs with no ChIP data because those DBFs have, on aver-
age, stronger and more informative motifs. Moreover, SparScape
uses ChIP data in a principled way, which led to more substantial
improvement over the raw score method on the ChIP DBFs.
Both methods predicted nucleosome sites with an FDR slightly
below and above 50%, respectively, across a range of sensitiv-
ities. See Supplementary Figure S5 for more results with a wide
range of posterior probability cutoffs.

For the mouse datasets, true BSs are not annotated, and there-
fore, we compared different methods based on the numbers of

Note: Non—Nuc is all considered DBFs except for the nucleosome. ChIP is the set of
DBFs for which ChIP data were available. No ChIP is the set of DBFs for which

predicted BSs for a ChIP DBF inside and outside its ChIP win-
dows. The MTL regions were chosen by requiring multiple ChIP
peaks from a small set of TFs to occur close to each other,
making it much less likely that peaks in these regions are false
positives. Likewise, we expect few true BSs further than 50 bp
from a ChIP-Seq peak (the coverage of our ChIP windows) but
within a few hundred base pairs. So we expect that the ChIP
windows capture a high percentage of true BSs in these regions.

As reported in Table 3, for the selected ChIP DBFs,
SparScape predicted a high percentage of BSs in a corresponding
ChIP window for different cutoffs on the posterior binding prob-
abilities. For example, in the Oct4 group data, we predicted
31773103 BSs in a matching ChIP window for the eight selected
ChIP DBFs, with only 9756 sites outside. Since the performance
of the raw score method and COMPETE in DBF selection was
unsatisfactory, we report their results on the sites predicted for
all 12 ChIP DBFs (Table 3). One clearly sees a much higher
percentage of BSs predicted outside ChIP windows. In the
most sensitive cases, SparScape predicted 77797% of sites for
ChIP DBFs within a corresponding ChIP window despite not
restricting site prediction to within ChIP windows, while only
2&30% of sites predicted by the raw score method and 20%
of sites predicted by COMPETE fell within a corresponding
ChIP window. This suggests that a high percentage (> 70%) of
the BSs predicted by COMPETE and the raw score method are
false positives, demonstrating that for the questions we consider,
our method is more sensitive and vastly more speciﬁc than the
alternatives.

Although the joint estimation of DBF concentrations and
binding landscape requires computationally expensive iterative
sampling, SparScape is reasonably fast. SparScape is imple-
mented in C++ with OpenMP, so runs most quickly on
boards with more CPUs. We tested computation time with 10
independent runs on a subset of the cMyc mouse data consisted
of just >52000bp in 100 regions with the 11 selected DBFs
(Table 1) in addition to the nucleosome. A total of 1250 iter-
ations took on average 37 min (with minimal variation) on a
MacBook Pro running OS X 10.6.8 with 2.53 GHz Intel core 2
duo processors and 4GB of RAM.

3.4 Application to gene promoters

SparScape is not designed to carry out DBF selection on entire
chromosomes or the whole genome. The enrichment of BSs for
any DBF other than the nucleosome is too thin and selection
results may be too sparse or inconsistent. For prediction of a
binding landscape over an entire chromosome or genome, we
recommend running SparScape on the entire DBF library with-
out selection and with a non-zero but small value of A to prevent
concentration inﬂation of DBFs with low-information or GC-
rich motifs. SparScape can, however, select DBFs effectively on
data less specialized than co-bound regions such as the Oct4 and
cMyc groups explored above.

We demonstrate this by randomly sampling 2000 mouse genes
and running SparScape on the upstream 1000 bp of these genes,
using upstream 4001 — 5000 bp as the control regions. The can-
didate library consisted of all 203 DBFs in our library with
unique PWMs. We ran 10-fold cross-validation to select A = 0,
and selected 45 DBFs with A = 0 and 41 with A = 0.05 (the value
used in the Oct4 and the cMyc mouse data). This represents 22%
of the DBFs considered, a very reasonable number to be en-
riched in a random sample of 10% of gene promoters from the
mouse genome. Supplementary Table S1 shows the DBFs chosen
with these two values of A ranked by posterior mean concentra-
tion. One indication that SparScape selected truly enriched pro-
teins is the presence of TATA box binding protein in both lists
(ranked ninth with the selected A = 0), since the TATA box is
known to be close to the transcription start site.

4 DISCUSSION

Generating a base-pairespecific binding landscape for all known
DBFs over the entire genome of higher organisms with large
genomes, without prior knowledge of DBF concentrations, is
currently prohibitively computationally expensive. When one
then considers only certain genomic regions, it is expected that
a large proportion of DBFs will not have true BSs, and perform-
ance suffers if all DBFs are considered. Requiring prior know-
ledge of the set of DBFs active in the regions of interest and their
concentrations introduces the need for (often ad hoc) user-
dependent prior or iterative analysis or a need for additional
experimental data. We contribute a new method, SparScape,
that eliminates the need for this prior information and takes
advantage of binding data where available while outperforming
alternate methods. One of the key features of our method is the

inclusion of penalization in Bayesian inference based on the ex-
pected false positive site counts. This signiﬁcantly reduces false
positive results both in DBF selection and in BS prediction. A
similar idea has been used in the contrast motif finder (Mason
et al., 2010). The unsatisfactory performance of COMPETE for
the problems we investigate suggests that tuning prior DBF con-
centrations when they are not given is difﬁcult in practice and
using an improper vector of concentrations can be risky for joint
prediction of landscapes. Moreover, both SparScape and the raw
score method select DBFs by comparing against some control
regions, but COMPETE does not have this critical component.
We want to stress that our comparison against COMPETE is
mostly for demonstration purpose as the method is not targeted
at DBF selection or predicting sparse binding landscapes.

As demonstrated by the results in this article, with the default
method for choosing the level of penalization, a standard usage
of SparScape usually works well. But in fact, SparScape is highly
ﬂexible. A user could independently choose less stringent DBF
selection by setting a smaller penalty value and perform a single
selection run, instead of 10-fold cross-validation. This option is
particularly useful when the goal is to predict sites for all DBFs
that could at all plausibly have BSs in the considered regions.
The default choice in the final post-selection landscape prediction
is to predict with the same penalty chosen in the selection stage
and with ﬁxed PWMs. A user may choose to make the predicted
landscape less sparse by running the ﬁnal prediction with no
penalty, reestimated PWMs or both.

Our modeling framework can easily be extended to include
other types of information. Some measure of absolute binding
afﬁnity, as opposed to the relative binding afﬁnity information in
a normalized PWM, is available from protein binding micro-
arrays (Berger et al., 2006) and could be included as energy
models (Djordjevic et al., 2003; Foat et al., 2006; Zhou, 2010).
Further work integrating ChIP peak strength in the scoring of
binding in ChIP windows could be fruitful, especially for nucleo-
somes. Other location-speciﬁc information on DBF binding to
the sequence could also be used. We plan further work using
SparScape’s joint binding landscape to predict gene expression
and offer insights into the underlying regulatory network.

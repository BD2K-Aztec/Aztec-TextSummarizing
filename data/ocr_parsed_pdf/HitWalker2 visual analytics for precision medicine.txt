Abstract

Summary: The lack of visualization frameworks to guide interpretation and facilitate discovery is a
potential bottleneck for precision medicine, systems genetics and other studies. To address this we
have developed an interactive, reproducible, web—based prioritization approach that builds on our
earlier work. HitWalker2 is highly flexible and can utilize many data types and prioritization methods
based upon available data and desired questions, allowing it to be utilized in a diverse range of stud—
ies such as cancer, infectious disease and psychiatric disorders.

Availability and implementation: Source code is freely available at https://github.com/biodev/
HitWalker2 and implemented using Python/Django, Neo4j and Javascript (D3.js and jOuery). We
support major open source browsers (e.g. Firefox and Chromium/Chrome).

1 Introduction

Across domains, the need to integrate and prioritize genes or variants is
a common theme—for therapeutic selection, as well as for mechanistic
and perturbation studies. Network-context methods can facilitate
the ranking of genes and associated genetic variants/mutations. For in-
stance, some serve to rank the variant genes of individual subjects rela-
tive to orthogonal biological assay data (Bottomly et (11., 2013; Jia and
Zhao, 2014) whereas others can be used for GWAS or QTL studies
(Kohler et (11., 2008). As a whole, these approaches can integrate differ-
ent data types and statically report results, but up to now have
not focused on making the data ‘accessible’ with respect to discovery,
interpretation and knowledge acquisition. To this end we developed
HitWalker2, which is a highly customizable approach to both produc-
ing a ranked list of genes utilizing network and external information
and exploring these results using graph-centric interactive visualiza-
tions. Details of the HitWalker2 workflow and framework itself can be
found in the Supplementary Material.

2 Description of software

2.1 Overview

The original HitWalker R package provided a means to priori-
tize variants stored in an SQL database and display the results
using a static image of a relevant subnetwork and a text sum-
mary that could be exported to an Excel document. Interaction
with the program was via R syntax and as such it required a
working R environment or access to a server that does and
some familiarity with the language (or additional training
time).

HitWalker2 contains all of the features of the original but add-
itionally was designed as an approach to allow users to access mean-
ingful aspects of their data through interactions with genes, subjects
and groups as a series of graphs organized as panels. The vast major-
ity of these interactions involve mouse clicks and dragging oper-
ations, a paradigm which bench scientists and clinicians will be
familiar with.

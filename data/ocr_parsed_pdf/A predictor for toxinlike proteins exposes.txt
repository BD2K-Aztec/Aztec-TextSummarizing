ABSTRACT

Motivation: Animal toxins operate by binding to receptors and ion
channels. These proteins are short and vary in sequence, structure
and function. Sporadic discoveries have also revealed endogenous
toxin-like proteins in non-venomous organisms. Viral proteins are
the largest group of quickly evolving proteomes. We tested the
hypothesis that toxin-like proteins exist in viruses and that they act
to modulate functions of their hosts.

Results: We updated and improved a classifier for compact proteins
resembling short animal toxins that is based on a machine-
learning method. We applied it in a large-scale setting to identify
toxin-like proteins among short viral proteins. Among the ~
26000 representatives of such short proteins, 510 sequences were
positively identified. We focused on the 19 highest scoring proteins.
Among them, we identified conotoxin-like proteins, growth factors
receptor-like proteins and anti-bacterial peptides. Our predictor was
shown to enhance annotation inference for many ‘uncharacterized’
proteins. We conclude that our protocol can expose toxin-like
proteins in unexplored niches including metagenomics data and
enhance the systematic discovery of novel cell modulators for drug
development.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, with the expansion of genomics data and the
development of ‘next-generation sequencing’ we have witnessed
unprecedented growth in sequence information as reﬂected in the
~20 million UniRef sequences. Several niches that remain poorly
annotated are viruses, environmental metagenomics sequences and
short proteins.

Short sequences are of special interest from a biotechnological
and medical perspective as they are relatively easy to produce,
they are often one domain proteins and more importantly, they may
be used in medical research. From a bioinformatics and statistical
perspective, annotation of these sequences remains challenging
due to low similarity signals (often within the realm of noise).
Consequently, typical automated methods cannot reliably assign
such sequences to their homologous groups. As a result, short
proteins constitute an uncharacterized and fragmented subset of
sequence space. Another major uncharacterized group covers the
world of viruses. Viruses are extremely diverse and their importance
to agriculture and human health is self-evident. Nevertheless,
most viral proteomes are reported as ‘translated sequences’ with

a very poor annotation of their content (polymerase and envelope
proteins being the exception). Co-evolution of viruses and their
hosts constitutes a major evolutionary driving force (Bahir et al.,
2009). As a result, key cellular functions are acquired by viruses to
enhance their infectivity and replication efﬁciency (Woolhouse et al.,
2002). Examples of host cellular components that are mimicked
by viral proteins include mimicry of receptors and antigens of the
immune system. In addition, sophisticated modulation by viruses
that infect any taxonomical group, from bacteria to human is directed
towards the most sensitive cellular function including the ubiquitin
system, signal transduction cascades and the translational machinery
(Marques and Carthew, 2007). These mechanisms are best studied
in light of host—virus co-evolution (Sorek et al., 2008).

Animal toxins make up one of the most highly over-represented
functional groups among the short proteins. Toxins are proteins
that appear in animal venom and are aimed at inﬂicting harm to
the organism on which the venom acts (Jungo and Bairoch, 2005;
Tan et al., 2006). Most animal toxins are short proteins (ranging
from 30 to 120 amino acids). They are extremely varied in terms
of function and include ion channel inhibitors, phospholipases,
protease inhibitors, disintegrins, membrane pore inducers and more
(Tan et al., 2003). Such toxins are detected in sporadic species along
the evolutionary tree of the animal kingdom including scorpions,
snakes, bees, wasps, frogs and numerous animals living in the sea
(e.g. stoneﬁsh, snail, jellyﬁsh, cone snail and hydra). Interestingly,
proteins that share a common scaffold with animal toxins have
also been sequenced in non-venomous species. In recent years,
an increasing number of proteins resembling animal toxins have
been identiﬁed in non-venomous contexts and shown to act as
natural cell modulators. These toxin-like proteins include proteases,
protease inhibitors, as well as secreted proteins which resemble
cell antigens, growth factors and more (Whittington et (11., 2008).
A strong evolutionary relation exists between animal toxins and
ancestral cysteine cross-linked proteins (Fry, 2005; Fry et al., 2006;
Kini, 2002). Some of the more striking examples include proteins
resembling snake or-neurotoxins identiﬁed in humans and rodents
(Miwa et al., 1999). To date, most of these toxin-like proteins have
been discovered sporadically but the availability of rich sequence
resources argues for a more systematic search strategy towards cell
modulators.

We have developed a classiﬁer for ranking protein sequences
according to their toxin-like properties. The classiﬁer is able to create
a robust characterization of proteins that display characteristics
of short, cysteine-based compact proteins, many of which are
indeed toxin-like (Kaplan et (11., 2007). Application of the classiﬁer
to the ~10 000 predicted protein sequences from the sequenced
honey bee proteome identiﬁed several such sequences, leading

A predictor for cell modulator candidates in viral genomes

 

to the experimental conﬁrmation of an overlooked ﬁinction of a
voltage-gated channel inhibitor (Kaplan et (11., 2007).

Herein, we developed an improved and updated version of the
classiﬁer, called ClanTox-10 (for Classiﬁer of Animal Toxin-2010)
and applied it to the prediction of toxin-like proteins in all known
viral sequences. The revised classiﬁer is tuned to cope with genome-
scale input and was reﬁned through an updated protein training set.
An improved discovery rate is achieved by combining the predictor
with sequence features such as the presence of a ‘signal peptide’.
We show the results of the predictor for 508 (often uncharacterized)
proteins, all predicted as toxin-like proteins, ~10% of which were
classiﬁed with a very high-degree of conﬁdence. The observation
that viral proteins appear to include sequences that are candidates for
growth factors, ion channel inhibitor and anti-bacterial short proteins
opens new research avenues in the search for naturally evolved cell
modulators. The analysis of a sample of these proteins is presented
along with their postulated modulatory role.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data collection

Proteins for Viruses were collected from UniProt (preiler et (11., 2004). We
included queries to the retrieval system to eliminate all ‘fragments’ and used
the UniRefl 00 clusters to reduce the over-representation of the more heavily
studied Viruses. All together we started with ~773 000 sequences (Organism:
Virus). The set was reduced to 214 000 by eliminating incomplete sequences
and unprocessed genomes (excluding ‘Fragment’ and ‘Polyprotein’). The
short sequences (~40 000 sequences, 107120 amino acids) from this list
were clustered according to UniRefl 00 to produce a ﬁltered list of ~26 000
proteins. Less than 5% of these are curated and represented in the SwissProt
collection.

2.2 Bioinformatics analysis tools

SignalP was used for predicting signal peptides (Bendtsen et (11., 2004).
ClustalW and alignment Viewer tools were used from EBI’s (ClustalW2)
server and the NCBI (Cobalt multiple sequence alignment). Multiple
sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis was based on (PHYLIP tree).
PHYRE (Kelley and Sternberg, 2009) was used for fold recognition and
InterProScan (QueVillon et (11., 2005) was used for sequence motif detection.

2.3 Feature vector construction

Each protein sequence was represented as a vector of 545 sequence derived
numerical features. In brief, the generic features include (i) amino acid
frequencies (single and consecutive pair frequencies, total of 420 features);
(ii) Sequence length (m, l feature). The rest of the features were driven by
the importance of speciﬁc amino acids and their spacing, with a special
consideration for cysteine. The stability of short animal toxins is often
mediated by the multiple disulﬁde bridges of paired cysteines. Note that
the features were not restricted to cysteine-related features and were derived
from all 20 amino acids: (i) cysteine binary 5-mers: The sequence is divided
into 5-mers. The number of such 5-mers is m-4, where m is the protein length.
For example, a protein of length 30 reports on 26 such 5-mers. Cysteines are
translated into Is, and the remaining amino acids are translated into 0 s. A 25
legitimate combinations are possible, providing 32 features. (ii) Charged-
polar residues binary 5-mers: similar to cysteine binary 5-mers, except that
charged and polar residues (Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg, Asn, Gln) are translated into 1
and the rest are translated into 0. As above, it provides 32 features. Note that
the binary descriptors replace any explicit information on the hydrophilic
or polarity index of amino acids. (iii) Amino acid entropy: a quantitative
measure of how much each amino acid type is dispersed throughout the
sequence (20 features). For a given amino acid type c, we denote its positions

in the sequence as p1,...,pk its positions in the sequence. We deﬁne pg :0
and pk+1 =m+ 1. We deﬁne the entropy of c to be:

k-l—l >_ g >_ >_
entropy(c)= —Z  log2  (1)

[’21

(iv) Circular center of mass (CM): we added a quantitative measure that
encodes the relative location and distribution of each amino acid type in the
sequence. For a given amino acid type c, we again denote its positions in
the sequence as ppk. The feature formalizes the following notion: If
the sequence is spread clockwise around the 2D unit circle, we can calculate
the mean of the points on the circle that match [71 , pk and deﬁne it as the
circular mean of c. This measure is supported by the observation that in short
folds the two ends are relatively close in space. Formally:

k >_ k ’—
CM(c)=<%z:sin<W)’£22005<271(1;2  (2)
i=1 i2]

2.4 Training and learning sets

Selection of a training set is based on careful manual evaluation due to
the diversity in ‘animal toxins’ and some misuses of the term ‘toxin’. We
used a combination of annotations and keywords including ‘ionic channel
inhibitor’. Following exclusion of protein fragments, 924 sequences were
collected and manually veriﬁed. Following a sequence similarity-based
clustering (cutoff at 90% identity using global sequence alignment), we
remained with a positive set of 627 sequences. We manually removed 23
sequences that are mostly proteins fused to Ion channel inhibitor (ICI)
or incorrectly identiﬁed as such. Note that the protein length restriction
was not applied for the training set. We selected several sets of negative
instances from a random UniProtKB from which we removed ‘fragments’
or any obvious redundancy (according to UniRef90). For these sets, proteins
annotated as ‘toxin’ were eliminated. We selected random sets with a size
distribution that matches that of the true instances that are 2-fold larger. Six
independent such sets were used. The ﬁnal training set consists of the union
of the non-redundant sets of positive (ion channel inhibitor non-redundant
set) and negative (non-toxins) proteins. The list of the 604 sequences that
were used as a positive set is found under ‘technical support’ in the ClanTox
web server.

2.5 Learning algorithm

The learning algorithm that was used is a meta-classiﬁer based on the boosted
stumps algorithm. In a nutshell, the stump classiﬁer is trained to ﬁnd the
best linear separation available by a single feature (i.e. tries all possible
thresholds on all possible features and uses the best threshold). In the boosted
stumps method, the AdaBoost algorithm is applied to the stump classiﬁer.
Subsequently, a stump classiﬁer is trained on the instances, so that instances
with higher weights are penalized more heavily. Following the training, the
weights of the instances that were mispredicted are adjusted, and so on. Each
such iteration is referred to as a boosting iteration. The ﬁnal prediction is
in the form of a linear combination of stump classiﬁer predictions (one per
boosting iteration, where the weight of each stump classiﬁer is determined by
its error rate). The prediction is a real number, rather than a binary prediction.
A value >0 signiﬁes a sequence that is toxin like (positive).

Since learning algorithms often require input of additional parameters
and each choice of parameters can give different results, a parameter-tuning
framework was included. In order to determine the optimal number of
iterations, the classiﬁer is evaluated on every boosting step by its area
under the curve (AUC) performance (in a 3-fold cross-validation test). The
parameter value which maximizes the AUC is chosen for the ﬁnal classiﬁer.
The boosted stumps method performed faster and outperformed support
vector machine (SVM) and boosted decision trees (data not shown).

We adapted a meta-classiﬁer so that the predictions it makes are
a combination of the predictions made by 10 different boosted-stumps
classiﬁers. For a given set of true instances, 10 separate training sets are

Fig. 1. A scheme of the prediction procedure. A protein sequence is

generated. Next, a parameter-tuned boosted stump classiﬁer is trained on
each set. The outputs of all 10 classiﬁers are normalized by the highest
positive prediction of each classiﬁer on the training set (respective to each
classiﬁer). The ﬁnal prediction of the meta-classiﬁer is the arithmetic mean of
the predictions of all 10 classiﬁers. Additionally, the meta-classiﬁer provides
the SD of the predictions on each sequence as a measure of robustness. Other
methods of ranking and binning the results were similarly effective (data not
shown). A prediction is considered to be positive prediction if the mean is
greater than the SD. By this approach, the meta-classiﬁer is able to provide
a more robust hypothesis, which is minimally biased by a speciﬁc choice of
false instances. An overview of the prediction scheme is show in Figure l.

A formal detailed outline of the learning scheme is presented under
‘technical support’ in Clantox web server.

2.6 Cross-validation

Cross-validation was performed and evaluated by the area under the curve
(AUC). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve formed by the
predictions of the classiﬁer shows the TP rate and FF rate at all possible
thresholds (i.e. each possible threshold is plotted as a point). The AUC is
measured as the area under the ROC curve formed by the predictions.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Prediction performance of ClanTox-10

An evaluation of the predictor (presented initially in Kaplan et (11.,
2007) was performed to test the impact of updating the training
sets (UniProtKB release 15.13). In ClanTox-lO, negative instances
were selected differently than in the original version of the classiﬁer
(Kaplan et (11., 2007). The classiﬁer showed a high level of success,
with a mean AUC of >099 (Fig. 2). Note that the value calculated
is equal to the Mann—Whitney—Wilcoxon non-parametric test. From
a list of >500 features (see Section 2), the most dominant features
repeatedly identiﬁed by the classiﬁer are the density (Entropy) and
the spacing of cysteines (CM, see Section 2). Both feature types are
crucial to structural properties underlying the fold stability. The high
performance in the cross-validation test indicates that the classiﬁer
captures a robust phenomenon. However, the success of AUC test
is not necessarily a direct measure for the success of the classiﬁer
towards an unseen data set.

We tested the performance on an updated set of SwissProt that
covers 500 000 proteins (a set that is 2-fold larger than was initially
tested). We characterized the performance of the classiﬁer towards
short proteins (67 900 proteins in the range of 10—120 amino acids,

represented by 36 000 non-redundant representatives). The classiﬁer
successfully identiﬁed among the positive predictions hundreds of
proteins enriched in secretory proteins. This is an intriguing ﬁnding
as no explicit features support this property. In addition, signiﬁcant
enrichment was associated with multiple general categories (Fig. 3).
The classiﬁer positively predicted ~900 sequences that are enriched
in proteins from toxin/venom, defensin and brevenin, anti-fungal
and anti-bacterial sequences, uncharacterized proteins and more.
Manual inspection of the results indicated that most of the positive
predictions do not belong to genuine ICI proteins (recall that all
ICI annotated set was eliminated for such test). Instead, enrichment
in proteins that act as cell modulators in diverse biological
contexts become evident (Fig. 3). For example, defensins and
brevenins and short secreted peptides from the skin of mammals
and amphibians, respectively. These proteins are active in host-
defense mechanism against invading organisms and thus are also
considered antimicrobial peptides. Interestingly, ribosomal proteins
and protamine—like proteins were positively identiﬁed yet with a
reduced conﬁdence score. These ﬁnding suggests that the classiﬁer

is able to identify modulatory functions beyond the ‘ion channel
inhibitors’ for which the system has been trained for.

We then tested all the keyword annotations (from UniProt) that
are most statistically signiﬁcant according to their P-value (P-value
is calculated according to the hypergeometric distribution and
corrected by Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing).
Among the most signiﬁcant annotations (P <E-100) are for snake
toxins, secreted proteins (based on annotation of signal peptides),
Phospholipase A2, Knottin, protease inhibitor and defensin (ranges
at E-70—E-60). A detailed list can be found in technical ‘help’ on the
webserver (Naamati et (11., 2009). Functional enrichment terms also
included immune recognition elements and disintegrins (P <E-30).

3.2 Viral proteins are fragmented, poorly annotated
and redundant

Viral proteins are very biased and overrepresented by few viral
families (Bahir et (11., 2009). Currently, ~8% of all sequences in
the UniProtKB database (preiler et (11., 2004) are viral proteins
(773 000 proteins). The number of viral proteins that are ﬁill-length
proteins (without polyproteins) drops to 214000 sequences. The
length distribution of viral proteins is also different from that of
the other kingdoms. We limited the analysis for proteins of length
10—120 amino acids that comprise ~40 000 sequences that are
clustered into ~26 000 representatives (according to UniRef100,
Fig. 4). While the number of ‘uncharacterized’ and ‘putative’ viral
proteins (excluding ‘fragment’) is 6.8%, for proteins shorter than
120 amino acids this fraction reaches 22%.

3.3 Positive prediction of toxin-like cell modulators in
virus proteome

We used the 25 982 short proteins as input for ClanTox. Only
2% (508 proteins) of these sequences were predicted as toxin-like
proteins (Table 1).

From a biotechnological and medical perspective, the most
attractive proteins are short ones. Driven by this preference, we

tested the viral sequences according to their length partition.
The results of the 6004 proteins whose sizes are in the range of
10—80 amino acids are shown in Figure 5. This set contributes to
~50% of all positive predictions and ~80% of the most conﬁdent
predictions (class ‘High’ and ‘Very high’). The discovery rate drops
drastically in sets composed of proteins that are longer (Table l).

3.4 Conotoxin-like proteins are prevalent among the
highest rank predicted proteins

Fifty-one proteins were identiﬁed at the highest scores (Table l),
of which 12 are marked as ‘uncharacterized’. A sample of the top-
ranked predicted proteins is shown, alongside the distribution of
cysteine residues (Fig. 6, left). Surprisingly, among the top listed
proteins, we identiﬁed several proteins annotated as conotoxin-like
proteins. Conotoxins are one of the largest groups of neurotoxic
peptides isolated from the venom of the marine cone snail.
Conotoxins mostly act to modulate the activity of ion channels.

We performed a BLAST search and a multiple sequence alignment
(MSA) analysis for the proteins listed as conotoxin-like proteins
(Fig. 6, Framed). This family was ﬁirther expanded by including
all (non-identical) sequences supported by NCBI. A total of 67
proteins were identiﬁed in 26 taxa. A total of 24/26 organisms are
found in dsDNA viruses. The other two are found in fungi and sea
anemone proteomes. The MSA is composed of 28 viral proteins that
are reported by UniProtKB (Fig. 6, right).

Several observations strengthen the relevance of these top
predicted viral proteins as genuine conotoxins: (i) all 65 viral

predicted by ClanTox. The three top scoring conotoxin-like proteins are
framed in orange; an overlooked homologue to conotoxin-like protein is
framed in black. Right: multiple sequence alignment based on BLAST nr
search. Twenty-six out of 28 representative proteins are Viral proteins that
are present in 21 different Viruses. Bottom: an HIVIM logo of Pfam family
PFO8087 that is associated with the Conotoxin O-superfamily (see text).

conotoxin-like proteins have a signal peptide as predicted by Signal
P (Bendtsen et (11., 2004). (ii) The MSA of the signal peptide is
weakly conserved relative to the ‘mature’, apparently active, peptide
(Fig. 6, right). (iii) Like many of the conotoxins, six cysteines
(Fig. 6, right, marked in yellow) that form three disulﬁde bonds
are conserved throughout. (iv) Key residues that are essential in the
active conotoxin peptides are shown by the MSA. These residues
include the conserved Gly, two conserved Glu and a hydrophobic
residue (either Phe, Tyr). (v) Structural modeling (Kelley and
Stemberg, 2009) of the sequence of the top predicted conotoxin-
like proteins overlap the template of the conotoxin fold (solved by
NMR).

Most viral conotoxin-like proteins that are predicted by ClanTox-
10 match the PFAM PFO8087, Toxin_18, Conotoxin O-superfamily.
The HMM based logo of these sequences is presented in
Figure 6 (bottom). The HMM-logo based on Pfam covers
mostly Baculoviridae and sequences from few insects (Aphid and
Mosquitos). Based on the MSA using the ClanTox-10 conotoxin-
like proteins as a seed we were able to expand the family and
to include sequences from Fungi and Sea anemone. Note that
sequences presented in the MSA include all six conserved cysteines
(as opposed to four cysteines in PFO8087, Fig. 6, bottom).

Among the viral conotoxin-like proteins, two major subfamiles
are evident (Fig. 6, right). The 20 protein sequences in the top of
the MSA belong to one subfamily while the other eight sequences
comprise the second subfamily. Whether the proteins that belong
to the two subfamilies differ in their activity towards speciﬁc ion
channel targets is unknown and calls for experimental testing.

3.5 Knottin fold is abundant among positively
predicted proteins

Most top predicted proteins (classiﬁed with either ‘Very high’
or ‘High’ conﬁdence, Table 1) lack similarity to other proteins.

Structural modeling (Kelley and Stemberg, 2009) was used to
propose structural resemblance. For example, the 70 amino acids
of UniProt: Q5QC64 from Monkeypox virus (predicted as ‘High’)
was modeled as a knottin-related structure (using PDB 2B68 as a
template). Best fold prediction suggested the defensin and to a lesser
extent a scorpion toxin which blocks calcium-activated potassium
channels (PDB lDU9). Knottin fold proteins (Hartig et (11., 2005)
share a variety of cell modulatory functions such as immune defense,
anti-bacterial activity, receptor binding domains and as insecticides.
Among the positively identiﬁed viral proteins, we identiﬁed tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-like receptor and epidermal growth factor
(EGF)-like growth factor (similar to neuronal neuregulin).

3.6 Inference annotation task

Most positively predicted proteins were assigned with moderate
conﬁdence (Fig. 5, Table 1). Although we set the predictor threshold
to be rather conservative, the quality of such predictions is
questionable. Nonetheless, we suggest that many of the ‘moderate’
predictions are valid as potential cell modulators: (i) testing proteins
of the venomous snake proteins indicated many validated toxins
to be assigned to the ‘moderate’ class (Naamati et (11., 2009).
(ii) Bioinformatics inspection of the listed 457 proteins (Table 1)
reveals that 30.5% contains a signal peptide (using SignalP), but
only 5% are annotated as such in the entire input set. Recall that
all toxin-like proteins are expected to be secreted. (iii) Applying
the classiﬁer to the entire set of viral proteins that are annotated as
‘secreted proteins’ (total of 628 proteins represented by 537 clusters,
UniRef100), identiﬁed 20 proteins in accord with the View that the
signal peptide per se does not convey the predictive power of our
classiﬁer.

We were able to suggest new annotation for a number of positively
predicted proteins. For example, UniProt P24284 (VB05_VACC8)
named ‘truncated plaque-size/host range protein’ from Vaccinia
virus is a short protein (92 amino acids). This protein contains a
classical signal peptide and a Sushi domain. This gene product was
shown to affect plaque size (Takahashi-Nishimaki et (11., 1991). The
Sushi domain is found in many adhesion proteins. Proteins with
this domain (large proteins) were identiﬁed in other viruses such
as Epstein Barr virus (EBV), where the protein is a glycoprotein
receptor. We propose that the P24284 is a non-functional mimic
of an adhesion unit and potentially affects virus infectivity. This
hypothesis calls for ﬁirther research.

3.7 ‘Toxin-like’ viral proteins under-represented in
domain and family annotations

ClanTox exposed 508 sequences that are candidate toxin-like
proteins. We tested the overlap between this set and several
domain and family expert systems. Pfam and InterPro provide
the most extensive cover for domains and families. However, we
found that this ‘toxin-like set’ is poorly covered by such systems.
Among the 508 sequences, about half (248) have no annotations
by Pfam or InterPro. All together, this list is associated with 26
Pfam entries including entries that provide little information such
as ‘Uncharacterized protein family’ (39). Additional Pfam entries
include conotoxin-like proteins, growth factors and their receptors,
adhesion-like domains and putative zinc ﬁnger. Interestingly,
the largest group of proteins that were annotated are the TAT
transactivation regulators (Fig. 7). While TAT function as RNA

binding proteins, they are considered to be multifunctional virus-
encoded cytokine-like protein factor. As such it displays the
activities of several growth factors and chemokines. TAT proteins
have a unique stability and pleotropic ﬁinction on cells activation,
growth, and transformation even in the absence of other viral
structures. This overlap between our prediction and the large body
of TAT co-activators strongly support the notion that other cell
modulators are among the list of ~500 identiﬁed proteins. A list
of 20 viral proteins that belong to this diverse set of viruses that
infect human is shown (Table 2).

4 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

Applying ClanTox-10 to viral proteomes has become possible
through the use of an implementation can cope with genomic-scale

input (Naamati et (11., 2009). Using ClanTox as a ‘microscope’
for overlooked modulators predicted to be toxin-like proteins was
proposed. Our approach can be extended to other sequencing
resources and transcriptomic data. An attractive resource is that
of the metagenomics data originating from environmental samples.
The number of phages and viral sequences is very high and at
present, most lack annotation schemes (Edwards and Rohwer, 2005),
while the relevance of metagenomics to human health has become
increasingly appreciated.

The ﬁnding of a large number of conotoxin-like peptides in viruses
is intriguing. Two scenarios may account for this observation:
(i) fast evolving convergent evolution of short secreted proteins
as proposed for many of the cysteine-rich proteins (Fry, 2005).
(ii) Genetic material exchange from hosts to viruses. Such a scenario
was suggested in some instances. A cysteine-rich encoding region
was shown to transfer from the endoparasitic wasp Campoletis
sonorensis to the symbiotic polydnavirus (CsPDV) (Cui and Webb,
1996). The role of such toxin-like proteins to the life cycle of
the viruses is unknown. Interestingly, a report on a conotoxin-like
peptide in baculovirus from 20 years ago showed that deletion of
the gene (called ctl) had no effect on the kinetics and virulence of
infection (Eldridge et (11 ., 1992). For over half of the 508 proteins that
were positively identiﬁed by the classiﬁer, no signiﬁcant similarity
can be found. It is an expected outcome of the fast evolution of
viral genomes (Fig. 7). However, in instances where a signiﬁcant
similarity can be traced (using PSi-BLAST, IntrProScan (Quevillon
et (11., 2005), ProtoNet cluster assignment (Kaplan et (11., 2005) and
annotations based on Pfam, an over-representation of insect genomes
is apparent. An example is the protein B6S6X8 (113 aa) from
Betabaculovirus that is similar to many short peptides in Drosophilae
proteomes.

The cross-talk of the viral proteins as candidates for cell
modulatory ﬁinction in View of the speciﬁc host is currently being
investigated. The extreme underrepresentation of toxin-like viral
proteins for infected bacteria may reﬂect the inability to support
disulﬁde bridges in most bacteria.

The systematic discovery of short peptides as modulators is of
great interest for peptide therapy. We expect to use our procedure
to ﬁnd such potential candidate sequences. Currently, several
conotoxins were proven successful in treatment of acute pain in
animal models (Scott et (11., 2002). Some pain managing drugs that
are based on a conotoxin scaffold were approved for clinical use
(Alonso et (11., 2003).

In summary, the ClanTox can identify short proteins that function
as non-toxin cell modulators that are beyond the function of
toxins. Among the ~500 viral positive predictions, we identiﬁed
a surprising number of conotoxin-like proteins, growth factors and
their receptors and several sequences resembling adhesion units.
About 34% of the toxin-like proteins for which the host is known are
from viruses that infect human and primate. Therefore, we postulate
that some of the sequences identiﬁed in this study carry a potential
for drug development and for manipulating virus—host interaction.

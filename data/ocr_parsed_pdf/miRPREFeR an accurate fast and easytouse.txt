“Known miRNA annotations are from miRBase v20. An miRNA is expressed if at least 20 reads were mapped to the miRNA precursor region in the dataset.

job running on a high—performance computing system is killed
because of resource limits, or the laptop that the user works on
runs out of battery. By restarting a job from the latest checkpoint
other than starting it from the beginning, a lot of time/resources
can be saved for long—running jobs on large plant genomes. As
far as we know, miR—PREFeR is the first microRNA prediction
tool that provides such a useful feature.

3 IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS

miR—PREFeR is implemented using Python. There is no need for
the users to install it, and it works under Linux/MacOS/
Windows. The pipeline is able to use multiple CPUs/cores auto—
matically. This makes the pipeline much faster than existing pro—
grams and is easier for the users to use their computational
resources.

We benchmarked miR—PREFeR and several popular or newly
developed NGS—based miRNA prediction tools including
ShortStack (Axtell, 2013), miRDeep—P (Yang and Li, 2011),
miRanalyzer (Hackenberg et al., 2011), miRDeep2
(Friedlander et al., 2012), miRDeep* (An et al., 2013) and
MIReNA (Mathelier and Carbone, 2010). The features of the
tools can be found in Supplementary Table S1. We used two
datasets from Arabidopsis thaliana to evaluate the performance
of the tools. The first dataset, Athl—2, which contains two sam—
ples, is the dataset used in the ShortStack paper (Axtell, 2013).
The second dataset, Athl—6, contains six published samples from
different tissues/conditions. The details of the datasets can be
found in the Supplementary Table S2. Table 1 shows the per—
formance of each tool on the two datasets. miRanalyzer has the
best sensitivity, but the numbers of predictions are large on both
datasets. It is likely that most of these predictions are FP predic—
tions. It should be noted that miRanalyzer tries to detect anno—
tated miRNAs that are saved in its own database. This is why its
sensitivity is higher than all other tools. miRDeep2, miRDeep*
and MIReNA have low sensitivity on both datasets, which indi—
cates that they should not be the first choice for annotating plant
miRNA. ShortStack is designed to be speciﬁc; thus, it has the

lowest FP rate and reasonable sensitivity. miR—PREFeR has the
second highest sensitivity and low FP rate. The predictions from
miR—PREFeR have large intersections with predictions from
ShortStack (See Supplementary Fig. S4). Details about the data—
sets and experiments from more species (maize, Medicago,
papaya and peach) can be found in the Supplementary File.

Most of the predictions from miR—PREFeR correspond to
previously annotated miRNAs. In all, 77.8% of the miR—
PREFeR—predicted miRNAs have the same start positions as
their annotations. In all, 81% of the predictions have the same
lengths as the annotations. The high consistency was also
observed in a large—scale study about miRNA isoforms in
A.thaliana (Jeong et al., 2013). On the other hand, other tools
show much lower consistency with previously annotated
miRNAs. More detailed analysis can be found in section 3.1 of
the Supplementary File.

miR—PREFeR achieves 4 x ~37 >< speedup compared with
ShortStack, which can annotate other types of small RNAs
and is the second fastest tool (see Supplementary Tables S4
and S5). miRDeep—P and MIReNA have long running time on
both datasets. Without manually parallelizing the jobs, it is even
difficult to run the two tools on small genomes on a personal
computer. miR—PREFeR uses less memory than the other tools
on both datasets.

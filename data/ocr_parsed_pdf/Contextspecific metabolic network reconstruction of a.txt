Abstract

Motivation: With the advent of meta—'omics’ data, the use of metabolic networks for the functional
analysis of microbial communities became possible. However, while network—based methods are
widely developed for single organisms, their application to bacterial communities is currently
limited.

Results: Herein, we provide a novel, context—specific reconstruction procedure based on metapro—
teomic and taxonomic data. Without previous knowledge of a high—quality, genome—scale meta—
bolic networks for each different member in a bacterial community, we propose a meta—network
approach, where the expression levels and taxonomic assignments of proteins are used as the
most relevant clues for inferring an active set of reactions. Our approach was applied to draft the
context—specific metabolic networks of two different naphthalene—enriched communities derived
from an anthropogenically influenced, polyaromatic hydrocarbon contaminated soil, with (CN2) or
without (CN1) bio—stimulation. We were able to capture the overall functional differences between
the two conditions at the metabolic level and predict an important activity for the fluorobenzoate
degradation pathway in CN1 and for geraniol metabolism in CN2. Experimental validation was con—
ducted, and good agreement with our computational predictions was observed. We also hypothe—
size different pathway organizations at the organismal level, which is relevant to disentangle the
role of each member in the communities. The approach presented here can be easily transferred to
the analysis of genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic data.

1 Introduction

Microbes are shaping the world and, by forming communities, are
causal of geochemical cycles (Mascarelli, 2009), human health
(Kinross et al., 2011), and biotechnological processes (Beloqui et al.,
2008). Thus, it is not surprising to find increasing interest in study—
ing how these consortia lead to function (Carter et al., 2012).

The analysis of microbial communities begins by assessing the
structure of the population, which is currently often achieved using
metagenomic data (Roling et al., 2010). The next step consists of
characterizing the metabolic capacity of the microbial community,
but this has proven to be a considerable challenge, even when using
metatranscriptomic data (Moran et al., 2013). This need has led to
the development of metaproteomics, by which at least the abundance
of metabolically active molecules can be detected (Seifert et al., 2013).
In parallel, methods for analysing these data have arisen and evolved.

From the outset, computational methods have been essential for
capitalizing on data to obtain clear and novel insights (Guazzaroni
and Ferrer, 2011). Traditional approaches described in the literature
typically map data for genes, proteins or metabolites onto well—known
pathways or Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Yamada et al., 2011). This
enables identifying molecular functions of identified proteins in light
of metabolic pathways. However, the high connectivity among biolo—
gical pathways has shifted the focus to networks (Letunic et al., 2008;
Palsson, 2009), which allows us to capture more global properties
(McCloskey et al., 2013). Molecular networks integrate different
pathways and constitute a more general framework for interpreting
‘omics’ data (Bordbar and Palsson, 2012).

On the single—species level, different computational methods
have been developed to analyse ‘omics’ data using genome—scale
metabolic networks. In particular, a number of approaches have
been specifically designed to incorporate gene and protein expres—
sion data (Jerby et al., 2010; Rezola et al., 2013) as well as metabol—
ite and ﬂux levels (Pey et al., 2013; Zamboni et al., 2008) to
characterize context—specific metabolic phenotypes. Based on these
methods, novel insights into the metabolic organization of organ—
isms have been obtained (Vitkin and Shlomi, 2012) and more prac—
tical questions have arisen, such as how to improve the efficiency of
industrial biosynthetic processes (Agren et al., 2013; Boyle and
Silver, 2012; Curran and Alper, 2012; Poblete—Castro et al., 2013).

These approaches start from genome—scale metabolic networks,
which are reconstructed from the annotated genome of an organism
(Bachmann et al., 2013; Zomorrodi et al., 2012) and a reference
metabolic database as input information. Thiele and Palsson (2010)
described the steps for accurately building a metabolic network, which
can be time—consuming, easily taking from 6 months to 2 years. With
the aim of easing this process, the Model SEED provides an integra—
tive and automatic approach that substantially speeds up the time
required to obtain a first network draft (Henry et al., 2010).

For microbial communities, the reconstruction of metabolic net—
works is more complicated and faces new challenges. Ideally, each
organism can be represented by its own metabolic network and its
input/output metabolites define its possible interaction with other
members of the consortia. Should this information be available, re—
cently developed constraint—based modelling approaches could be
applied. In this situation, methods mentioned above to incorporate
‘omics’ data for single organisms could be extended to deal with
bacterial communities.

However, in complex bacterial communities the number of or—
ganisms could be extremely high, most typically lacking a high—qual—
ity, genome—scale metabolic network, which makes the
identification of shared components between organisms even more
complicated. For this reason, current approaches have been applied
to well—known microbial consortia, including only a limited number
of organisms, typically 2 or 3 (dos Santos et al., 2013; Khandelwal
et al., 2013; Zomorrodi and Maranas, 2012).

To overcome this issue, the use of a supraorganism or meta—
network has been proposed (Borenstein, 2012), which ignores boun—
daries for each organism, but models community—level metabolism.
In an early work (Greenblum et al., 2012), using a graph theoretical
approach, metagenomic data were used to reconstruct the human
gut microbiome metanetvvork in different conditions, finding key
variations in patients with obesity and inflammatory bowel disease.

In this study, we exploit this metanetvvork strategy and present a
novel computational procedure for obtaining a context—specific
metabolic network for a bacterial community using metaproteomic
data. In contrast with the work presented in Greenblum et al.
(2012), we did not use a graph—theoretical approach, but a con—
straint—based one, which takes into account stoichiometric relation—
ships. In particular, our approach takes some ingredients from the
mathematical optimization model presented in the Model SEED
(Henry et al., 2010). However, our approach is fundamentally differ—
ent: it is designed for bacterial communities, not for a single organ—
ism, and focuses on the usage of metaproteomic data, which directly
leads to a contextualized network that gives cohesion to identified
proteins. We also use the taxonomic assignment of the identified pro—
teins to favour the inclusion of enzymes annotated in the genomes of
those organisms in cases where such information is available.

Our approach is applied to draft the metabolic networks of two
different, naphthalene—enriched communities (Guazzaroni et al.,
2013) derived from an anthropogenically inﬂuenced, polyaromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH)—c0ntaminated soil with (CN2) or without (CN1)
bio—stimulation with calcium ammonia nitrate, NH4NO3 and
KHZPO4 and the commercial surfactant Iveysol®. Naphthalene, a
model PAH compound, is a common, persistent pollutant in crude oil
and industrial chemical manufactures that can be released into the en—
vironment (i.e. soils) through anthropogenic activities (Kastner, 2000).
Current treatments for naphthalene— and other PAH—contaminated
sites involve the use of bio—surfactants and additional electron ac—
ceptors as well as nitrogen sources (nitrate and ammonia) to improve
the bioavailability and bioremediation of these compounds. It has also
been observed that many bacteria are capable of degrading and grow—
ing on naphthalene (Guazzaroni et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2011), and
their activities might only be limited by environmental conditions.
Thus, gaining insight into the mechanisms underlying naphthalene
degradation can aid in the design of better remediation strategies.

2 Methods

Here, we present our computational procedure for determining a
functional, context—specific metabolic network for bacterial com—
munities using metaproteomic data. Based on a reference metabolic
database (Henry et al., 2010), we seek a functional network that in—
cludes the maximum number of measured proteins (highly likely set,
H) in a given sample. We may have evidence that some proteins are

not expressed (lowly likely set, L) and, therefore, their participation
is minimized. Then, we complete the network using enzymes in the
database, preferably those annotated in active organisms in the com—
munity (medium likely set, M) (Guazzaroni et al., 2013).

We denote the set of enzymes from the reference database not
included in H, L and M as D, namely D involves the subset of non—
identified enzymes that are currently annotated for organisms not
present in the community. By linking proteins to reactions via
Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers (Bairoch, 2000), sets H, L, M
and D may also refer to reactions.

When we refer to a functional network, we mean a subset of re—
actions that are able to produce biomass at steady state under the
specified medium conditions. We describe these conditions in detail
and introduce the mathematical notation below.

We denote the sets of reactions and compounds in the reference
metabolic database as R and C, respectively. The set of reactions is
typically classified into reversible and irreversible reactions. For con—
venience, both reversible and irreversible reactions are divided into
two non—negative steps: forward and backward reactions. We define
the set B : {(f,b)l reaction f and reaction b are the reverse of each
other, f < b}. For each reaction 1' E R we define a flux variable, 11,-,
and a binary variable, z,, where z,: 1, if 11,-> 0, 0 otherwise. We de—
note the stoichiometric coefficient associated with the metabolite i
E C and reaction / E R as s,,-. This information is stored in the stoi—
chiometric matrix, S.

The steady—state assumption implies mass balancing and, there—
fore, the accumulation/depletion of metabolites inside the system is
not possible, as observed in Equation (1). The definition of the boun—
daries of the system is an important issue. As noted above, in complex
bacterial communities, the previous knowledge of shared input/output
metabolites is typically not available. For the sake of simplicity, we
only include boundaries for the whole community and remove boun—
daries between individual organisms. Therefore, we obtain a metanet—
work in which the identified proteins from various organisms in the
community are coexpressed. Using exchange reactions, we then define
metabolites that can be taken up from outside (the boundaries of) the
system (culture medium conditions) and those that can be excreted
outside (the boundaries of) the system, which may prevent the net—
work from utilizing unavailable nutrient sources.

As our aim is to obtain a metabolic network that supports
growth, we must define a biomass reaction. Given that we are using
a metanetvvork strategy, the biomass reaction represents a consensus
equation for all organisms in the community. Note that determining
an appropriate biomass reaction is a challenging task, even for single
organisms (Feist and Palsson, 2010). However, using an existing
biomass reaction from a different organism is a common practice
(Nogales et al., 2008), as many constitutive compounds are shared
across a wide range of organisms. Equation (2) forces a minimum
ﬂux through the biomass reaction (vbio).

As ﬂuxes are non—negative, their lower bound is 0, as observed in
Equation (3). We also fixed a sufficiently large value for their upper
bounds.

As noted above, our approach takes some elements of the math—
ematical optimization model presented in the Model SEED (Henry
et al., 2010). However, our purpose is different, as we aim to obtain
a context—specific reconstruction for bacterial communities, not for

Fig. 1. Proposed reconstruction workflow. The context-specific metabolic net-
work reconstruction algorithm starts from a database of reactions, experi-
mental (metaproteomic) data and knowledge about growth medium as input
data. It involves three steps: (i) construction of a basic network capable of
using the available nutrients to produce biomass; (ii) addition of alternative
pathways for biomass production and (iii) network expansion with pathways
not necessarily involved in biomass production

a single organism, based on metaproteomic data. Instead of a gen—
eral metabolic reconstruction, our aim is to build a network as spe—
cific to the observed phenotype as possible, given the measured data.
To this end, we include important technical differences. In particu—
lar, we use a 3—step iterative procedure based on linear programming
and mixed integer linear programming. We describe each of these
three steps below. A graphical summary of the complete workﬂow
of our approach can be found in Fig. 1.

2.1 Step 1: basic functional network
Due to regulatory effects, the experimental measurement of proteins
is not sufficient to guarantee their activity (Seifert et al., 2013). This
is typically observed in the conﬂicting trade—off between enzymes in
the H and L sets (Agren et al., 2012; Becker and Palsson, 2008;
Shlomi et al., 2008). In other words, the use of all enzymes in H may
involve a considerable number of enzymes in L, whose participation
in the reconstruction must be in general avoided (Akesson et al.,
2004). For this reason, we prefer to leave the decision of selecting
enzymes in H and L to the optimization model, which incorporates
evidence from metaproteomic data in the objective function. This
allows metaproteomic data to influence the resulting network, with—
out directly constraining it.

The objective function is presented in Equation (4). In particular,
the ﬂux activity is guided by its penalization, 17,-, and bonus, bi, terms,
similar to what is performed in the Model SEED (Henry et al., 2010).

minimise 2(1),- — b,)v,- (4)
ieR

where p,- and b,- are the sums of various concepts. Weights are
defined such that, by minimizing Equation (4), which is subject to
Equations (1)—(3), we obtain a functional metabolic network in
which ﬂuxes in H will prevail, followed by those in M, then those in
D and, finally, those in L. As in the Model SEED (Henry et al.,
2010), we penalized reversibility changes and favoured the comple—
tion of KEGG modules that were substantially covered with meta—
proteomic data. Finally, in order to avoid the ﬂux bias introduced
by the specific stoichiometric representation of each reaction
(Brochado et al., 2012), weights were rescaled using maximum ﬂux
values obtained from ﬂux variability analysis (Mahadevan and
Schilling, 2003). See Supplementary Material I for further details.

It should be noted that the introduction of continuous ﬂuxes in
Equation (4), in contrast to the Model SEED (Henry et al., 2010),
which includes binary variables (z), does not guarantee the optimal
use of metaproteomic data, i.e. the reactions in H. The removal of
binary variables converts a highly expensive, mixed integer linear

program into a linear program, which can be easily solved; however,
optimal solutions obtained from linear programming are extreme
points, which, in conjunction with our minimization objective func—
tion, generate networks involving a limited number of degrees of
freedom. Through Steps 2 and 3 described below, we aim to further
exploit experimental evidence from protein expression data.

2.2 Step 2: alternative pathways for biomass production
Once Step 1 is solved, we obtain a list of active reactions, N1. In this
second step, we aim to capture alternative pathways for biomass
production that are not included in N1 using the reactions in H, but
not in L. To this end, we block each of the reactions in N1, one—
by—one, and resolve the linear program posed in Step 1, i.e. Equation
(4), which is subject to Equations (1)—(3). As a result, we obtain a
number, card(N1), of functional networks. The rule here is to merge
N1 with those networks that include additional reactions in H, but
not in L. Therefore, we obtain a functional network (N2) that makes
better use of the metaproteomic data for biomass production.

Note that the solution from Step 1 is the result of solving a linear
program, whose optimal solution is an extreme point, a solution
with zero degrees of freedom. For that reason, all the reactions
involved in N1 are necessary to produce biomass. As relevant alter—
native routes for biomass production are added into the model using
Step 2, the number of degrees of freedom of the resulting solution is
increased, while reducing the number of essential reactions/enzymes.

2.3 Step 3: network expansion

Once Step 2 is concluded, we may not have included all measured
enzymes in N2. We denote K as a particular set of these enzymes
that we aim to include in the reconstruction. Note that K will typic—
ally involve all enzymes from H that are not included in N2, possibly
obtaining a maximum use of the metaproteomic data. However, if
our purpose is to emphasize the metabolic differences between two
conditions under study, K could involve a subset of them, namely,
those that are differentially expressed. To achieve this goal, we ad—
dress one further optimization problem.

We begin from Equations (1) and (3). The constraint on biomass
production, Equation (2), is removed, as it is currently satisfied in
N2. We now make use of binary variables, zi. In particular,
Equation (5) relates v and z variables, where M is the maximum
ﬂux, and the minimum (non—zero) ﬂux is 1. Equation (6) prevents
reaction f and its reverse b from being active simultaneously.

Zf+zb£1 V(fib)EB (6)

Then, for each enzyme, / E K, we introduce a continuous vari—
able, e,-, with a value between 0 and 1, as observed in Equation (7).
In Equation (8), if any of the set of reactions, R’, that are associated
with enzyme / E K cannot be activated, then e,- is necessarily 1; there—
fore, to maximize the use of the enzymes in K, we must minimize the
e,- variables. This is achieved by amending the objective function as
in Equation (9). In particular, for the e,- variables, we assign the max—
imum overall penalty, wi.

Equation (9), which is subject to Equations (1), (3), and (5 )—(9), is
a mixed linear integer program and empirical evidence shows that it is

not an expensive problem (<100 s in the instances considered in
Section 3). Active reactions from this optimization problem are added
to N2 and define the final resulting metabolic network, N3.

3. Results

3.1 Reconstruction of the CN1 and CN2 functional
networks

The approach presented above was applied to draft the context—spe—
cific metabolic networks of two different naphthalene—enriched
communities, CN1 and CN2 (Guazzaroni et al., 2013). These com—
munities were obtained from an anthropogenically inﬂuenced,
PAH—contaminated soil with (CN2) or without (CN1) bio—stimula—
tion. Metaproteomic data from CN1 and CN2 constituted the input
information in our study (Guazzaroni et al., 2013).

In our analysis, we only considered proteins with an annotated
metabolic function, i.e. with an EC number, namely 570 out of
1234 measured proteins, collectively involving 327 unique EC iden—
tifiers. Based on the relative protein concentrations, we classified en—
zymes found in CN1 and CN2 (Guazzaroni et al., 2013) into the H,
L, M and K sets as follows (see Section 2). For one scenario, enzymes
listed in that sample were included in the H set, while enzymes that
did not appear in that sample, but did appear in the other scenario,
were included in the L set. As we were interested in obtaining net—
works that emphasized the differences between both scenarios, the
K set involved up—regulated enzymes in each scenario. In particular,
enzymes showing a 1.5—fold change in their relative protein concen—
trations in one sample compared with the other were considered up—
regulated.

Note that the relative protein concentrations were calculated as
previously described (Guazzaroni et al., 2013). Brieﬂy, similar to
IBAQ values (Arike et al., 2012), protein intensities per sample
(CN1 or CN2) were calculated as the average peptide intensities in
the replicas. Obtained quantitative values were normalized by me—
dian division. Then, these protein intensities (per sample) were
summed and the relative concentration of an individual protein (per
sample) was calculated by dividing the protein intensities by the
summed protein intensities. Replicate values were finally averaged.
This approach should reﬂect the individual protein abundance in
each community proteome.

Using full—length and partial 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained
through a metagenomic approach (Guazzaroni et al., 2013), it was
found that 13 and 12 distinct species constituted the CN1 and CN2
communities, respectively, with only two species (Achromobacter
and Azospirillum) conforming to the common set (see
Supplementary Material I). While Azospirillum, Comamonas,
Achromobacter and Pseudoxanthomonas species dominated CN1,
Pseudomonas and Achromobacter species dominated CN2. This in—
formation was used to aid in the context—specific network recon—
struction process. In particular, the set of related genome
annotations for CN1 and CN2, which was established on the basis
of phylogenetic affiliations (Guazzaroni et al., 2013), was obtained
from the KEGG website. The enzymes (ECs) from these genome an—
notations, which were neither included in H nor L, were included in
the M set. Full details regarding these organisms and genome anno—
tations can be found in the Supplementary Material I.

The list of reactions and metabolites was downloaded from the
Model SEED database (Henry et al., 2010). The above enzyme lists
were translated into reaction lists using their EC numbers annotated
in this database. The D set comprised ECs (enzymes) from the
Model SEED database not included in H, M and L. When a reaction

was associated with more than one EC belonging to different sets,
the reaction was assigned to the most favourable set. For example, if
a reaction could be catalyzed by one enzyme from H and one from
L, then the reaction was assigned to H.

A minimal medium based on naphthalene as the only carbon
source (as was used in the enrichment cultures; Guazzaroni et al.,
2013) was defined for the reconstruction process (see
Supplementary Material I). The biomass reaction was taken from a
Pseudomonas reconstruction that was provided by SEED
(rxn12834), as this specie plays a major role in CN2. We also used
annotated modules from KEGG.

The computation time for both CN1 and CN2 reconstruction
was <200 s. All computations were performed on a 64—bit Windows
XP machine with an Intel Core 2 CPU at 2.4GHz and 8 GB of
RAM. The code was written in MATLAB and CPLEX was used to
solve the linear optimization problems.

The complete details of the reactions, metabolites, and enzymes
involved in the contextualized reconstruction of CN1 and CN2 can be
found in the Supplementary Material II. Note that randomly perturb—
ing the selected weights with a 10% uniform noise only changed a
few reactions, giving rise to very similar networks (see Supplementary
Material I). For CN1, we used 148 of the 206 enzymes from H and
21 enzymes from L, and we completed the network with 274 and 165
enzymes from M and D, respectively. Similarly, for CN2, we em—
ployed 259 of the 311 enzymes from H and 1 enzyme from L; and we
completed the network with 267 and 282 enzymes from M and D, re—
spectively. In both cases, the use of enzymes from H was remarkable,
corresponding to >70% of the measured data, which was increased
to ~90% for up—regulated enzymes (K set). In contrast, the number of
enzymes in L required a more careful reading.

As noted above, there are reactions in the Model SEED database
that involve more than one EC number and are, therefore, catalyzed
by different enzymes. For example, if a reaction is catalyzed by one
enzyme from H and one from L, we assume that the ﬂux through
this reaction is supported by the enzyme from H, which is consistent
with the experimental data. An inconsistency arises when reactions
that are exclusively catalyzed by enzymes in L are included in the re—
construction. We found four reactions of this type in CN1, which
collectively involved three enzymes of 21. In particular, two of these
inconsistent reactions in CN1 were associated with EC 2.5.1.9
(riboflavin synthase) and are required to produce FAD (ﬂat/in aden-
ine dinucleotide), an essential metabolite for biomass production.
The third reaction was linked to EC 2.4.1.227 and is required to
produce the peptidoglycan subunit of P. putida KT2440, which is
involved in biomass production. As this metabolite is specific for
Pseudomonas, which is not involved in CN1, the need for this en—
zyme is unlikely. The fourth reaction is associated with EC 3.5.1.18
and is activated to support up—regulated enzymes. There is only one
inconsistent reaction in CN2, which is associated with EC 2.7.7.38
and their activation is due to the same reason as for EC 3.5.1.18.
The inclusion of these enzymes in CN1 is not in accord with the evi—
dence from metaproteomic data, which may be attributed to three
possible causes: (i) incompleteness of the Model SEED database; (ii)
inaccuracy of the biomass reaction or (iii) a lack of resolution in the
metaproteomic data. To address this issue, further experimental evi—
dence is required.

With the resulting context—specific networks for CN1 and CN2,
we decided to evaluate how single—reaction deletions could hamper
their ability to produce biomass. CN2 turned out to be more resilient,
as only 22 single—reaction deletions prevented its biomass production
capacity, in contrast with 42 single—reaction deletions in CN1.
However, the overlap was significant, as 19 of those reactions

affected both networks. When deleting enzymes related to a given EC
number, 31 instances affected growth in CN2 and 42 in CN1, with
23 of them being the same in both cases. In addition, we substituted
naphthalene as the only carbon source with each of the compounds
present in the reconstructed networks. CN1 was able to take advan—
tage of 26 compounds to produce biomass, while CN2 exhibited the—
oretical ability to use 446 compounds. We conducted the same
analysis with the nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur sources, finding
that CN1 could make use of 166, 114 and 34 compounds, respect—
ively, while CN2 could make use of 270, 212 and 104 compounds,
respectively. Although these results should be taken with caution,
they suggest that the metabolism of CN2 is more robust and varied
than CN1. The fact that the availability of substrates is promoted
during the bio—stimulation process used for obtaining a CN2 commu—
nity (Guazzaroni et al., 2013) might agree with this hypothesis.

3.2 CN1 and CN2 pathway analysis

To obtain a global picture of the pathways characterized in the CN1
and CN2 contextualized networks, we resorted to the use of KEGG
maps (see Supplementary Material I). In particular, to extract the
functional differences between CN1 and CN2, we compared the
KEGG maps using a score, jp, derived from the Jaccard distance. In
particular, for each KEGG map, we first calculated the Jaccard
index, ], between CN1 and CN2, with] : lA ﬂ Bl/lA U B), where A
and B represent the set of reactions involved in CN1 and CN2, re—
spectively, in a given KEGG map. Then, we determined the Jaccard
distance, I5: 1 — ], which measures the dissimilarity between CN1
and CN2 for a particular pathway. Finally, we multiplied the
Jaccard distance by the maximum between the number of reactions
that belonged to CN1, but not to CN2, and vice versa, i.e.
jp : I5 - max (lA O B), 1K ﬂ  This score gives more importance to
pathways where the CN1 and/or CN2 networks show high coverage
and share few reactions. An illustration of this process can be found
in Supplementary Material I for the ‘Histidine metabolism’ KEGG
map (Supplementary Fig. S1). Functional differences between CN1
and CN2 can be analysed via 11;, where the higher the value of 117,
the greater the difference between CN1 and CN2 and, hence, the
more relevant the pathway.

We ranked the KEGG pathways according to this measure for
the CN1 and CN2 metabolic networks. Table 1 shows some of the
top most different KEGG pathways between CN1 and CN2. We re—
peated the same analysis in two additional cases: (1) direct use of
metaproteomic data from CN1 and CN2, neglecting our network
reconstruction approach (‘Rank only metaproteomics’); (2) removal
of metaproteomic data, only considering CN1 and CN2 taxonomic
data and their annotated genomes in our network reconstruction ap—
proach (‘Rank taxonomics’). As observed in Table 1, substantial dif—
ferences can be found among them, which emphasize the effect of
our reconstruction approach, showing a clear contribution of prote—
omics to genomics data. The full details can be found in the
Supplementary Material I and III.

Table 1 shows clear differences between CN1 and CN2. The ge—
raniol degradation pathway (map00281) was predicted to be com—
pletely functional in CN2, but inactive in CN1. In CN2, enzymes
from H in this pathway were complemented with enzymes from M
and D. In contrast, in CN1, enzymes from H were discarded from
the reconstruction. On the other hand, the ﬂuorobenzoate degrad—
ation pathway (map00364) was filled in to some extent in the CN1
reconstruction, whereas it was inactive in CN2. Note that these dif—
ferences between CN1 and CN2 cannot be easily obtained from the
other two cases considered (see ‘Rank only metaproteomics’ and

The columns ‘CNl’ and ‘CN2’ indicate the number of reactions involved in CN1 and CN2 reconstructions active in the KEGG pathway under consideration.
The ‘Rank’ column indicates the position of KEGG pathways according to descending order of the obtained score. The ‘Rank (metaproteomics)’ column indicates
the rank obtained for KEGG pathways before the reconstruction process, namely with the score exclusively calculated from metaproteomic data of CN1 and
CN2. The ‘Rank (taxonomics)’ indicates the rank obtained after the reconstruction only with taxonomic data, i.e. with empty H, L and K sets

‘Rank taxonomics’). This is particularly relevant since these differ—
ences between CN1 and CN2 are experimentally validated below,
which shows the predictive power and need of the approach pre—
sented here.

3.3 Experimental analysis of fluorobenzoate and
geraniol metabolism in CN1 and CN2

Given the high rank obtained by the ﬂuorobenzoate and geraniol
degradation pathways and its specificity for CN1 and CN2, respect—
ively, we evaluated the correctness of these hypotheses. First, in sil-
ico stoichiometric analysis showed that CN1 was capable of
growing with ﬂuorobenzoate as the sole carbon source, and the
same was observed for CN2 and geraniol, after some minor correc—
tions to the obtained networks. In particular, for CN1 to produce
biomass from ﬂuorobenzoate, we needed to allow for the net pro—
duction of ﬂuoride (F—), which is found in abundance in soils
(McQuaker and Gurney, 1977) and in bacterial cultures as cellular
degradation by—product (Hidde Boersma et al., 2004). In the case of
CN2 and geraniol, we needed to change the direction of reaction
rxn07886 (geranic acid CoA-transferase) in the SEED Database,
which converts geranic acid into trans—geranyl—CoA and was origin—
ally defined to act in the opposite direction. Based on KEGG
(map00281) and existing literature (Clemente—Soto et al., 2014), we
found that this reaction is commonly annotated in the direction pro—
posed. Note here that the opposite is not possible, i.e. the growth of
CN2 and CN1 on ﬂuorobenzote and geraniol, respectively, as they
are not active in CN2 and CN1, respectively. It is important to clar—
ify that these issues come from inaccuracies in The SEED Model
database and not from the algorithm presented here. When doing
this modification prior to the reconstruction process, the resulting
networks directly grow on ﬂuorobenzoate in CN1 and geraniol in
CN2.

Secondly, in order to discard that the relevance of ﬂuoroben—
zoate in CN1 and geraniol in CN2 is an artefact derived from an in—
accurate biomass equation, we conduct a sensitivity analysis with
different existing biomass equations, finding that the major conclu—
sions achieved are conserved in most cases (see Supplementary
Material I for details).

Experimental validation assays were conducted to prove the ex—
tent of agreement with our computational predictions. For that, we
set up CN1 and CN2 enrichment cultures using previously described
conditions (Guazzaroni et al., 2013); instead of naphthalene as the
carbon source, geraniol and 3/4—ﬂuorobenzoate (0.1% w/v) were
used, and samples were taken at different time points (see
Supplementary Material I). Fingerprinting by Gas Chromatography—
Mass Spectrometry (GC—MS) was used to confirm the presence of
the initial substrates as well as the existence of degradation inter—
mediates in both cultures. A careful inspection of the MS signatures
of the initial metabolites known to participate in geraniol
(map00281) and 3/4—ﬂuorobenzoate (map00364) degradation (see
Supplementary Material I) confirmed the presence of 3/4—fluorocate—
chol in CN1 and citral and geranic acid in CN2. These findings dem—
onstrated that the ﬂuorobenzoate—degradation pathway occurred or
was active in CN1, while the geraniol—degradation pathway is active
in CN2. This was also confirmed by measuring the OD600 of the en—
richment cultures at different time intervals (Fig. 2). As shown, CN1
grew only in the presence of ﬂuorobenzoate (0.1% w/v), whereas
CN2 grew only in the presence of geraniol (0.1% w/v).

3.4 Contributions of bacteria to the CN1 and CN2
functional networks

We also attempted to quantify the contributions of particular sets of
microbes to the entire reconstructed, context—specific metabolic net—
work, where multiple proteins from multiple organisms are coex—
pressed. This is an important advance because the complement of
proteins used to metabolize recalcitrant pollutants and the specific
roles of different bacterial members within a consortium in pollutant
(or other potential carbon/energy sources) deconstruction are not
well explored.

As the population diversity and structures of the two enrichment
cultures were relatively low and well characterized, the taxonomic
affiliations of the proteins quantified in the shotgun metaproteomes
could be unambiguously established (Guazzaroni et al., 2013).
Based on this, for CN1 and CN2, we knew which members of the
community were actually expressing the enzymes used to catalyse
each reaction in H.

minimal medium in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) 3/4-fluorobenzoate and gera-
niol, respectively, at 30°C and 250 rpm. As shown, within the examined time
frame, no appreciable growth was observed in cultures of the CN1 and CN2
consortia in the presence of geraniol and fluorobenzoate, respectively

To evaluate the role of each bacterial member in CN1 and CN2
at the functional level, we determined its contribution to each
KEGG map. The contribution was determined as the number of
times a bacterium appeared in a KEGG map divided by its total
number of active reactions. For this analysis, we only took into ac—
count the reactions in H and M that were involved in the CN1 and
CN2 reconstructed networks. As noted above, the taxonomic affili—
ation was known for the reactions in H. In contrast, for the reac—
tions in M, different members of the community might be involved
in a reaction. For simplicity, in these situations, if possible, we as—
signed an organism that was previously included in the KEGG map
via the reactions from H. Full details as to the taxonomic assignment
of reactions involved in the CN1 and CN2 metabolic networks can
be found in Supplementary Material IV.

Figure 3 shows the contribution of each organism found in both
CN1 and CN2 to each KEGG map. Pathways were reconstructed
for the most abundant populations, which included composite gen—
omes for populations closely related to sequenced strains of
Achromobacter, Azospirillum, Comamonas, Mesorloizobium,
Microbacterium, Planctomycetes, Pseudoxanthomonas,
Singulisp/oaera and Pseudomonas.

Identification of genes for naphthalene processing (map00626)
and metabolic reconstructions suggested Achromobacter followed
by Mesorhizobium and Pseudoxanthomonas in CN1 and mainly
Achromobacter in CN2 as key groups for naphthalene degradation.
In addition, we identified Achromobacter, Azospirillum, and
Comamonas in CN1 and Azospirillum as well as Pseudomonas in
CN2 as groups that might primarily metabolize low molecular
weight molecules produced from naphthalene. It could also be
observed that, while metabolic reconstructions indicated a central
role played by Achromobacter in naphthalene degradation, multiple
bacteria participated in the active pathways (see Supplementary
Material I for further details; Figs. S3—S5). A careful examination of
the data presented in Fig. 3 clearly leads to a different pathway
organization at the organismal level.

bacterial community using metaproteomic data. Our approach was
based on the mathematical optimization model presented in the
Model SEED (Henry et al., 2010). However, we adapt this model to
incorporate metaproteomic data and obtain a context—specific meta—
network in which the identified proteins from the multiple organ—
isms making up the community are coexpressed. To this end, we
also include important technical differences. In particular, we use a
3—step iterative procedure based on linear programming and mixed
integer linear programming.

Our approach is an alternative to previously reported methods
(dos Santos et al., 2013; Khandelwal et al., 2013; Zomorrodi and
Maranas, 2012), where the role of each organism is explicitly repre—
sented in a different metabolic compartment and, therefore, their re—
lationships can be directly analysed. These methods require the
genome—scale metabolic network of each organism in the commu—
nity as input data, which, in consortia involving a high number of
species as we have here, is typically not available; therefore, we turn
to a metanetvvork approach, which involves several assumptions.
First, we need a consensus biomass equation that represents the
metabolic requirements of the community to support growth. With
metametabolomics approaches being developed, it is expected that
consensus biomass equations will be refined in the near future.
Second, a free exchange of metabolites between species is allowed,
as boundaries between individual organisms are not defined.
However, a metanetvvork could serve as a basis to disentangle the
role of each organism in the community, as suggested in Section 3.4.
More sophisticated approaches need to be developed for this task,
for example, analysing the role of a single organism in the context of
the entire metanetvvork.

Our approach was applied to draft the context—specific metabolic
networks of two different naphthalene—enriched communities
(Guazzaroni et al., 2013). Analysis of the resilience to single—reaction
elimination and the ability to grow on different sources suggests that
CN2 metabolism is more varied than CN1. Then, we used KEGG
maps to obtain a global picture of the reconstructed draft networks.
We were able to capture the overall functional differences between

CN1 and CN2 at the metabolic level. We showed that CN1 and CN2
utilize different metabolic pathways to synthesize essential metabolites
for growth. In particular, we hypothesized an important role for the
ﬂuorobenzoate degradation pathway in CN1 and for geraniol metab—
olism in CN2. Experimental validation was conducted and good
agreement with our computational predictions was observed.

On the other hand, we showed that these metabolic differences
lead to a different pathway organization at the organismal level. For
example, while naphthalene degradation (map00626) seems to be
supported by Achromohacter in both CN1 and CN2,
Mesorhizohium septentrionale and Pseudoxanthomonas japonensis
may be involved in an alternative pathway in CN1. In addition,
while metagenomic sequences outlined the broad metabolic capabil—
ities of the abundant populations present in an adapted community,
proteomics—guided metabolic reconstructions allowed us to focus on
the pathways that were actually expressed and refine the assignment
of roles for community members not only in naphthalene degrad—
ation but also in the assimilation of the low molecular weight com—
pounds produced from it.

These results show that network—based methods represent a
promising strategy for exploiting the value of data and the available
bioinformatics tools, allowing us to obtain a better understanding of
biological systems. As the available meta—omics data from scientific
studies at different levels are increasing, reconstruction procedures
will play an important role in disentangling contexts—specific meta—
bolic phenotypes. The approach presented here can be extended to
meta—genomic and meta—transcriptomic data and will clearly benefit
from the availability of meta—metabolomic data, mainly to address
the failure to detect all different enzymes (ECs) that catalyze differ—
ent reactions. Amending our approach to include these data is
straightforward.

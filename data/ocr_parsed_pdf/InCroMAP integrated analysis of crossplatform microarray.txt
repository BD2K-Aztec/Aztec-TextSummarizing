ABSTRACT

Summary: Microarrays are commonly used to detect changes in gene
expression between different biological samples. For this purpose,
many analysis tools have been developed that offer visualization, stat-
istical analysis and more sophisticated analysis methods. Most of
these tools are designed specifically for messenger RNA microarrays.
However, today, more and more different microarray platforms are
available. Changes in DNA methylation, microRNA expression or
even protein phosphorylation states can be detected with specialized
arrays. For these microarray technologies, the number of available
tools is small compared with mRNA analysis tools. Especially, a joint
analysis of different microarray platforms that have been used on the
same set of biological samples is hardly supported by most microarray
analysis tools. Here, we present InCroMAP, a tool for the analysis and
visualization of high-level microarray data from individual or multiple
different platforms. Currently, InCroMAP supports mRNA, microRNA,
DNA methylation and protein modification datasets. Several methods
are offered that allow for an integrated analysis of data from those
platforms. The available features of InCroMAP range from visualization
of DNA methylation data over annotation of microRNA targets and
integrated gene set enrichment analysis to a joint visualization of
data from all platforms in the context of metabolic or signalling
pathways.

Availability: InCroMAP is freely available as JavaT'V' application at
www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/lnCroMAP, including a
comprehensive user’s guide and example files.

1 INTRODUCTION

Typical workﬁows for the analysis of microarray data involve
several steps, namely, the preparation of samples and arrays,
their hybridization to arrays, scanning the array and processing
the image to read out the raW probe intensities. Depending on
the array type, several quality control and low-level data analysis
steps are then performed in silico. These steps mostly include
normalization, annotation of gene identiﬁers and the calculation
of diverse measures of differential probe-level intensities (such as
P—Values, fold changes or log ratios). Mostly, these tasks are
performed in R, a statistical programming language (WWW
.r-project.org) or by using derived applications With a graphical

user interface (e. g. Mayday; Dietzsch et al., 2006). The processed
datasets can then be used in various high-level data analysis tools
for further evaluation and data mining. A popular example is the
commercial Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (WWW.ingenu-
ity.com), Which links processed microarray datasets With path-
way analysis. However, most of these high-level analysis tools are
specialized on single platforms, and only a feW approaches are
available for an integrated analysis of high-throughput data from
heterogenous platforms. Furthermore, not many software tools
are freely available that offer suitable and easy-to-use analysis
and Visualization techniques for microarray platforms, other
than mRNA expression arrays.

Therefore, we developed InCroMAP, a user-friendly and inter-
active application With a graphical user interface that is specia-
lized on an integrated analysis of cross-platform microarray and
pathway data. InCroMAP supports DNA methylation, messen-
ger RNA, microRNA and protein modiﬁcation datasets. Besides
these platforms, it is possible to import data from any platform
that contains expression values that can somehow be assigned to
genes. A special emphasis has been put on the usability of the
application. Hence, all required ﬁles, for example, for mapping
gene identiﬁers to gene symbols, annotating mRNA targets to
microRNAs or pathways to Visualize, are either directly included
in the application or downloaded dynamically in the
background.

2 RESULTS

To integrate data from multiple platforms, a common denomin-
ator must be established. The vast majority of all data are some-
how associated With genes. Hence, integration of multiple data
types is performed by mapping each probe to a gene. This pro-
cedure is straightforward for protein or mRNA datasets. DNA
methylation datasets are region based and can be mapped onto
genes by deﬁning a Window upstream and downstream of each
gene’s transcription start site. InCroMAP proposes a Window of
—2000 and +500 bp as default region, but users may change
these values. Integration of microRNA data is performed by
annotating the genes of the mRNA targets to each microRNA.
For this task, the user can choose between three microRNA
target databases that contain experimentally veriﬁed targets
and three databases With predicted targets (listed in Fig. 1B;
databases reviewed in Alexiou et al., 2009).

A first approach to integratively investigate data from any two
platforms is the ‘data-pairing’ procedure. This procedure shows
two datasets next to each other, thus, simplifying common
lookup task, such as investigating the effect of a differentially

Fig. 1. Different views of InCroMAP. (A) The pop-up menu shows different methods that are provided for a joint analysis of heterogeneous microarray
platforms. (B) MicroRNA datasets can be annotated with three experimental and three predicted microRNA target databases directly from within the
application. In the background, the result of the ‘integrate heterogeneous data’ procedure is shown. (C) Integrated pathway-based visualization of
heterogenous microarray datasets allows to visualize up to four different platforms in a single pathway (here: excerpt from the ‘MAPK signalling’
pathway). Pathway nodes can be selected to get more detailed information, including various plots for all assigned expression values (here: DNA

methylation in the promoter region of ngr)

methylated promoter on mRNA level. Further, this VieW is es-
pecially suitable to inspect the effect of microRNA expression on
target mRNAs. An arbitrary amount of data from different plat-
forms can be inspected, using the ‘integrate heterogenous data’
procedure. To keep the clarity, only the most relevant informa-
tion, that is, the expression values (as fold changes or P-Values)
are shown. Therefore, one row is created for each gene and one
column for each platform. A hierarchical representation of the
table allows for expanding nodes to get more information, such
as all microRNAs targeting this gene’s mRNA (Fig. 1B). A
popular method for a generic analysis of expression data is per-
forming a gene set enrichment. We have extended this procedure
to an integrated gene set enrichment that is able to perform en-
richments across multiple platforms. The user can choose the
datasets and thresholds for each dataset to calculate a P—Value,
using a hypergeometric test for each predefined gene set (Backes
et al., 2007). InCroMAP supports gene sets from the KEGG
PATHWAY database (Kanehisa et al., 2006), Gene Ontology
and any gene set from the molecular signatures database
(WWW.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/). Furthermore, BioPAX
Level 2 and Level 3 pathways can be imported for Visualization
in InCroMAP.

The results of a pathway enrichment can further be Visualized
in metapathways (e.g. the ‘metabolic pathways’ map), together
With mRNA expression data and enriched sub-pathways.
All pathways are Visualized using KEGGtranslator (Wrzodek
et al., 2011), and InCroMAP extends these pathways by Visualiz-
ing expression data from each single platform therein. Therefore,

node colour is changed according to mRNA expression, and
small boxes are added and coloured according to each protein
modiﬁcation’s expression value. MicroRNAs are added as small
coloured triangles to the graph and are connected to their targets
With edges. DNA methylation data are indicated With a black bar
that shows the maximum differential peak in each gene’s pro-
moter (stretching from the middle to the left to indicate hypo-
methylation and to the right for hypermethylation). This is an
interactive graph, therefore, allowing users to modify the layout
and selecting nodes to get more detailed information and plots of
the associated expression data.

Besides those integrated analysis methods, InCroMAP allows
plotting region-based DNA methylation data in a genome plot
With boxes for gene bodies, Which in turn can be coloured
according to mRNA expression. Further, all enrichments can
also be performed on any single dataset, Which is straightforward
for mRNA or protein datasets, but implementations that can
also handle DNA methylation or microRNA data are less
common.

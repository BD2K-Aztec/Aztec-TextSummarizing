Abstract

Motivation: Ligand binding is a key aspect of the function of many proteins. Thus, binding ligand
prediction provides important insight in understanding the biological function of proteins. Binding
ligand prediction is also useful for drug design and examining potential drug side effects.

Results: We present a computational method named Patch—Surfer2.0, which predicts binding
ligands for a protein pocket. By representing and comparing pockets at the level of small local sur—
face patches that characterize physicochemical properties of the local regions, the method can
identify binding pockets of the same ligand even if they do not share globally similar shapes.
Properties of local patches are represented by an efficient mathematical representation, 3D Zernike
Descriptor. Patch—Surfer2.0 has significant technical improvements over our previous prototype,
which includes a new feature that captures approximate patch position with a geodesic distance
histogram. Moreover, we constructed a large comprehensive database of ligand binding pockets
that will be searched against by a query. The benchmark shows better performance of Patch—
Surfer2.0 over existing methods.

1 Introduction

 

Small molecules, such as metabolites and drugs, have important
interactions with protein receptors, regulating many different proc—
esses in biological systems. Therefore, predicting binding ligands can
provide important information for elucidating protein functions.
Predicting binding ligands for proteins can also provide useful infor—
mation for computational drug discovery, drug side effects and pro—
tein design. By combining computational screening with
experiments, protein—ligand interaction networks can be revealed
(Liu et (11., 2011).

In principle, ligands for a protein can be predicted by identifying
a global or local structure similar to known proteins. FINDSITE
(Brylinski and Skolnick, 2009) and GalaxySite (Heo et (11., 2014)
use a modeled structure by threading to predict binding ligands for
a target protein. Global structure—based methods capture distant

evolutionary relationships that provide powerful information for
function prediction; however, such methods have difficulty for cases
where proteins of largely different global structures bind the same
ligand molecules.

Local structure—based methods aim to identify similarity between
a target pocket and known binding sites. Local structure can be
compared at different structure levels. Catalytic Site Atlas (Porter
et (11., 2004) and AFT (Arakaki et (11., 2004) compare a few functional
residues in binding sites, where similarity is quantified with the
root—mean—square deviation (RMSD) of the residues. Pseudocenters of
residues (Gold and Jackson, 2006; Shatsky et (11., 2006) as well as
atom—level representation were also used (Hoffmann et (11., 2010).
However, cases have been reported where binding site residues for
some ligand types are not always well conserved (Denessiouk et (11.,
2001; Moodie et (11., 1996; Nagano et (11., 2002).

Alternatively, surface representations have been used for describ—
ing binding pockets. Surface representations do not explicitly specify
residue/atom positions in pockets and thus are coarser representa—
tions. The advantage of a surface representation is that it can attenu—
ate a certain level of differences in pocket shapes, which are
commonly observed in pockets of the same ligand type. eF—Seek
(Kinoshita and Nakamura, 2005) constructs a triangle mesh to rep—
resent protein surface. Das et al. (2009) used a histogram of dis—
tances between nodes in a triangle mesh that represents a protein
surface. SMAP performs pocket alignment using Delaunay tessella—
tion and amino acid residue comparison (Xie and Bourne, 2008).
ILBind (Hu et (11., 2012) combines FINDSITE and SMAP for inverse
ligand binding protein prediction.

Besides binding ligand prediction methods discussed earlier,
there are methods that predict binding pocket location in proteins
using various pocket descriptions. Those descriptions include grid
representation (Capra et (11., 2009; Kawabata, 2010; Li et (11., 2008),
atom triangles (Xie and Hwang, 2012) and ot—shape (Liang et (11.,
1998). COACH (Yang et (11., 2013) takes a consensus of multiple
programs.

Mathematical moment—based approaches have been identified to
be suitable for molecular surface representation. Moment—based
methods can naturally control the resolution of the surface descrip—
tion, and physicochemical properties on the surface can be repre—
sented in the same way as surface shape. Thornton and her
colleagues used spherical harmonics for describing binding pockets
(Kahraman et (11., 2007; Morris et (11., 2005). In our earlier works,
Pocket—Surfer, global pocket shape and the surface electrostatic po—
tential are represented using 3D Zernike descriptors (3DZD; Chikhi
et (11., 2010). Subsequently, we proposed Patch—Surfer, which repre—
sents a pocket as a set of small local surface patches, each of which
is described by 3DZD (Sael and Kihara, 2012). The local patch rep—
resentation of pockets enables the method to identify corresponding
regions in pockets even if the global shapes of pockets are different.

Although Patch—Surfer compared favorably against the existing
methods in terms of prediction accuracy, it was tested on small data—
sets with a limited number of ligand types. In this work, we com—
piled a large dataset of over 6000 non—redundant pockets with 2707
different ligands with which our method was tested. Moreover, the
algorithm was significantly improved in four more aspects: First, we
introduced a new feature of a patch called the approximate patch
position (APPS) that describes the relative position of the patch in a
pocket. Second, we use geodesic distance rather than Euclidean dis—
tance for computing distance between patches in a pocket. Third,
the procedure to identify corresponding patches in two pockets was
revised so that the selected patch pairs are guaranteed to yield the
minimum (i.e. best) score. Finally, we also consider similarity of lig—
ands when scores for each ligand are computed. On the large data—
set, we show that Patch—Surfer2.0 shows overall higher accuracy
than the previous version as well as existing methods.

2 Methods

2.1 Non—redundant binding pocket database

A non—redundant database of pockets with bound ligands was
constructed based on the protein—small—molecule database (PSMDB;
Wallach and Lilien, 2009). Starting from 5438 protein—ligand
complexes from PSMDB, we selected a non—redundant set of 2444
different ligand types in the 6547 pockets by careful examination of
ligand—protein interactions. One hundred seventeen ligand types
have more than five pockets. The selection procedure and the list of

the 117 ligands are provided in Supplementary Material
(Supplementary Table S1).

2.2 The Patch—Surfer2.0 algorithm

The original Patch—Surfer algorithm was described in our previous
papers (Sael and Kihara, 2010, 2012). Here we outline the algorithm
with an emphasis on the new implementation.

In Patch—Surfer, a query pocket in a protein is segmented into
overlapping local patches, each of which fits within a sphere of
5.0A radius. A surface patch is characterized with four features:
geometric shape, surface electrostatic potential, hydrophobicity and
concavity, each of which is described with 3DZD. A query pocket is
compared with pockets of known binding ligands in a database, and
binding ligands will be predicted from the list of pockets ranked by
the similarity to the query. To compute the similarity of two pock—
ets, corresponding patches in the two pockets are identified, and a
similarity score is computed based on geometric and physicochemi—
cal similarity of paired patches.

2.2.1 3D Zernike descriptors

3DZD is a series expansion of a 3D function that allows a compact
and rotationally invariant representation of a 3D object (Canterakis,
1999). 3DZD has been successfully applied for various biomolecular
surface representations (Kihara et (11., 2011). To compute 3DZD for
a pocket patch, a voxelized shape representation was created by
mapping atoms of the patch onto a 3D grid and assigning each voxel
a value of 1 if it is overlapped atoms and 0 otherwise. To represent
physicochemical values, i.e. electrostatic potential, hydrophobicity
or concavity, the values are mapped onto the grid instead of 1. The
value—mapped 3D grid was considered as a 3D function, f(x). This
ﬁx) is expanded into a series in terms of Zernike—Canterakis basis
defined as follows:

m i 3 _m
9,, — Ej‘x‘gnxﬂmwx (1)
where
anl(r7 197  : RnlYlm(197  

We used order 71:15, which corresponded to 72 invariants.
Yl'"(19, (1)) is the spherical harmonics and Rn[(r) is the radial function.
Then, the 3DZD, F”), is calculated as norms of vectors Q”). The
norm gives rotational invariance to the descriptor:

 

The distance of two 3DZDs is quantified with the Euclidean dis—
tance (L2 norm) of the vectors of F"). The distance of two patches,
pd3DZD, is a weighted average of 3DZDs of four features men—
tioned earlier. The weights were taken from our previous work (Sael
and Kihara, 2012).

2.2.2 Approximate patch position

APPS is a new term introduced in Patch—Surfer2.0. The APPS is a
histogram of geodesic distances between the center of a patch and
the other patch centers in the pocket. The geodesic distance is the
distance measured along the surface. The histogram tells a rough
position of a patch in the pocket, e.g. near an edge or around the
center. Geodesic distances were binned into 40 with a 1.0  interval.
APPS for two patches is quantified by the L2 norm of their
histograms.

2.2.3 Geodesic relative position difference

GRPD captures relative positions of patches in a pocket. Given two
pockets with identified corresponding patches between them, GRPD
for a new patch pair is the average difference of geodesic distances
between each of the new patches to existing patches in each pocket:

(5A,, SB ,-) denotes a pair of patch centers in pocket A and B, respect—

ively, to be examined, mA’B is a list of corresponding patches
between pockets A and B, and ) mA’B ) is the number of correspond—
ing patches. ) mA’B ) is at most the number of either of the size of
pocket A or B (i.e. the number of patches in the pocket), whichever
smaller. The corresponding patch in pocket B for patch [2 in pocket
A is denoted as SB mA,B(k). G2 is the geodesic distance between two
patch centers. In the original Patch—Surfer, we used the Euclidean
distance, but we revised it to the geodesic distance in Patch—
Surfer2.0.

2.2.4 Combined scores

The three scoring terms mentioned earlier are combined into a
composite score. Two terms, the patch physicochemical distance
using 3DZD termed pd3DZD and APPS, are combined with a
weight factor, W1:

MScore(A,B,mA’B) : wlpd 3DZD (A,B,mA*B)
+ (1.0 — W1)APPS(A,B,mA’B) (5)

The Matching score (MScore) represents similarity of corres—
ponding patches in pockets A and B. Then, we further combined
GRPD with MScore to yield the Total score (TScore), with wz:

TScore(A,B,mA’B) : w; >l< MScore(A,B,mA’B) + (1.0 — wz)
* GRPD(A, B,mA~B) (6)

Finally, the average TScore was computed as the final similarity

score between the two pockets for mA’B.

The first term nA/lmA’B) is for penalizing when the number of
matched pairs )mA’B) is smaller than the number of patches in
the query, 71/1. The smaller the score is the more similar the
pockets are.

2.2.5 Auction algorithm for identifying corresponding patches

To compute the scores, the correspondence of patches between two
pockets A and B, mA’B, is identified with a modified auction
algorithm (Sael and Kihara, 2010), which optimizes a target score
by matching patches. In the original Patch—Surfer, only pd3DZD
was optimized, and after the correspondence was established, the
other terms were added to ‘reevaluate’ the matches. In
PatchSurfer2.0, the final score (7) is used as the target function.
Thus, the optimality of the matching pairs in terms of the total score
is guaranteed.

2.2.6 Ligand-type prediction score
A query pocket will be compared with all the pockets in the data—
base, and the pockets in the database will be ranked by angScore.

Based on the ranked pocket list, predictions of binding ligands will
be made using Pocket_Scorew, which is the score of a query pocket
P for a ligand type F:

k 71 XL Wl(i) F
Pocket_scoreu, (P, F) : zoom-W 10g(?))  (8)

’1
1:1 2:1 WW

In essence, this is a type of k—nearest neighbor (where k is the num—
ber of top matches counted in computing the score), but distin—
guishes itself by three important enhancements for this particular
problem. First, a retrieved pocket at rank 1' contributes to the overall
score with a decreasing score of log(n/i) as the rank decreases, where
n is the number of pockets in the database. 101(1),]: is a similarity score
of two ligands, the ligand of the retrieved pocket at rank 1' and the
ligand F, computed with SIMCOMP (Hattori et (11., 2003).
SIMCOMP uses a graph matching algorithm to compare chemical
structures of two molecules. Its score ranges from 0.0 to the highest
score, 1.0. If the raw SIMCOMP score was less than 0.72, we set
tum-LP: 0. The second term expresses the enrichment factor of
ligand F within the rank [2. The ligand similarity score tum-M: is
newly used in Patch—Surfer2.0. In the original Pocket_Score (Chikhi
et (11., 2010), we simply considered only the same ligand as
the query, i.e. 5W}, which is 1 when [(1') equals to F and 0
otherwise. The entire procedure of Patch—Surfer2.0 is illustrated in
Figure 1.

3 Results

3.1 Analysis of score components

In Patch—Surfer2.0, three parameters, W1, L02 (5 and 6) and k (8),
must be determined. The optimization was performed on a subset of
the non—redundant binding pocket database, which contains pockets
for seven ligand types: adenosine monophosphate (AMP), adenosine
triphosphate (ATP), ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), ﬂavin mono—
nucleotide (FMN), glucose (GLC), heme (HEM) and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD).

First, we determined the W1 that optimizes MScore. Values of W1
were explored from 0.0 to 1.0 with an interval of 0.1 with a combin—
ation of different [2, which was changed from 25, 50, 100, 200, 300,
400, to 500. Each pocket of the seven ligand types was selected as
query and compared with all the remaining pockets in the database.

a result with different W7. A, Top 10; B, Top 15 accuracy

Then, binding ligands were predicted by Pocket_Score“, from the
ranked list of pockets.

Figure 2 shows the average Top 10 and Top 15 accuracy of the
seven ligand types with different combinations of W1 and [2 (more re—
sults on Top 5, 20 and 25 accuracy are provided in Supplementary
Figure S1). The Top X accuracy indicates the frequency of queries
whose correct ligand is predicted within the Top X predicted ligands
ranked by score. The accuracy increases as [2 increases and nearly
plateaus at [22200. We selected 0.4 for W1, because the accuracy
was the highest when averaged over all the values of k for Top 5, 10
and 15 accuracies. We selected 200 for [2.

With the W1 values decided earlier, we used the same process to
determine wz for TScore (Supplementary Fig. S2). These plots show
a similar trend to Figure 2; the curves in general plateaued at
k : 200. We chose 0.8 for wz, because that gives the maximum aver—
age accuracy over [2 for Top 5, 10, 15 and 20. [2 was set to 200
where the accuracy peaked with wz : 0.8.

Table 1 summarizes the accuracy of MScore and TScore using
the determined parameter values as well as individual terms,
pd3DZD, APPS and GRPD, and the original Patch—Surfer. TScore
showed higher accuracy than Mscore and all the individual scores
and original Patch—Surfer for all Top 5 to Top 25 accuracy. Among
the individual scores, APPS, the newly added term in this work, out—
performed the other two individual scores. APPS showed even
higher accuracy than the original Patch—Surfer. MScore that com—
bines pd3DZD and APPS was more accurate than using either one
of the scores individually.

Figure 3 examines the effect of considering the ligand similarity
weight, Wm),1:, in Pocket_score“, (8). The motivation of using the
weight is to give credit when a pocket is retrieved, whose natural
ligand is the same as the query but has been crystallized with a
different molecule (e.g. a drug). Since a bound molecule to a
pocket is usually similar to its natural ligand, the weight can provide
a partial score to the query’s natural ligand. Top 5 to Top 25
accuracies obtained by two scores were compared, ones computed
with Pocket_score“, with tum-M: and those obtained with
Pocket_score with 5W}. Overall, the accuracies improved by using
the tum-M: weight. An improvement of larger than 0.05
for Pocket_score“, over Pocket_score was observed for 14 cases
while a decrease in accuracy by more than 0.05 was observed for
four cases.

In the development stage, we have also incorporated a scoring
term that evaluates the pocket size difference between a query and a
retrieved pocket into MScore as in the original of Patch—Surfer.
However, it did not show an improvement in accuracy. This may be
because the new APPS term, which is a histogram, already contains
the pocket size information (data not shown).

3.2 Prediction on the remaining ligand types

Using the optimized parameters in the previous section, we bench—
marked Patch—Surfer2.0 for the rest of the ligand types in the binding
pocket database. Table 2 shows the average accuracies for the re—
maining 110 ligand types.

Top 10 and Top 15 average accuracies are 0.417 (0.438) and
0.526 (0.547). In the parentheses, the average accuracy for all the
117 ligand types are shown, since these are the accuracy that will be
experienced in practical prediction situations by users. Although
these accuracies are lower than the results on the training set in
Table 1, considering that the large number of pockets and ligand
types stored in the ligand database these accuracy values are useful
in practical applications. Indeed as we see later in more detail,
Patch—Surfer2.0 outperformed existing methods. In Table 2, we
also show the results when similar ligands are grouped by
SIMCOMP. The cutoff values used (0.72—0.50) make modest and
reasonable grouping of ligands. Even a SIMCOMP score of 0.50
clusters only ligands with up to a few atom changes: for example,
monosaccharides including glucose and mannose are grouped but
not combined with sucrose or phosphono—fructopyranose, and
NADH is grouped with NADP but not clustered with ATP. Thus,
biologically meaningful separation of ligands is still maintained with
a lower cutoff value of grouping. When ligand groups are
considered, ligands in the same group are considered as ‘identical’
molecule when accuracy is computed. With the ligand grouping
with a SIMCOMP score of 0.5, Top 5 and Top 10 accuracy reached
0.46 and 0.63, respectively.

Until now we reported average accuracy over different ligand
types. Next we take a closer look at the results for different ligands.
Prediction accuracy can vary considerably from ligand to ligand.
Among the 117 ligand types, 28 ligands (25.5%) have an accuracy
of over 0.7 in Top 10 accuracy, while it was 0.0 for 15 ligands
(13.6%). Figure 4 shows five ligands that were predicted well and
four that were predicted poorly. The five well—predicted ligands are
diverse in structures and functions, including natural ligands and
their analogs, and drug molecules. These include not only rigid

observed to bind different targets in different conformations.

We examined whether the prediction accuracy deteriorates for
binding pockets for ﬂexible ligands. We define the ligand ﬂexibility
ratio as the number of rotatable bonds per heavy atom. Overall, we
see a weak trend; the correlation coefficient between the ligand
ﬂexibility ratio (Supplementary Table S1) is —0.45 and —0.50 for
Top 10 and Top15 accuracy, respectively. Ligand binding is difficult
to predict if ligands are too ﬂexible as the four failed cases in
Figure 4. In particular, 1PG and 12P are extreme: they have 14 and
37 rotatable bonds and ligand ﬂexibility ratio of 0.82 and 0.92, re—
spectively (by comparison, the ligand ﬂexibilities of 017, GNP and
NDP, are 0.32, 0.25 and 0.27, respectively). However, 1PG and 12P

ation for X—ray crystallography and are not relevant to biological
functions of the proteins. We found other polyethylene glycols, 2PE,
P33, PE4, 1PE, P6G, 15P as well as two similar molecules, C8E and
PG6, have a ﬂexibility ratio over 0.8 and have poor prediction ac—
curacy of below 0.125 for Top 10 accuracy (except for C8E whose
accuracy was 0.375). The other two poorly predicted ligands, TAM
and 1PS, are molecules commonly used as buffers. Thus, the poor
prediction results for the four ligand molecules may be reﬂecting the
fact that the molecules in precipitant or buffer bind non—specifically
to proteins.

Removing ﬂexible ligands increases the prediction accuracy. In
Table 3, we show the accuracy when 10 ligands with a ﬂexibility
ratio over 0.8 are excluded from the queries. Compared with the re—
sults in Table 2, Top 10 accuracy has improved from 0.438 to 0.472
for the all 107 ligands and 0.628 to 0.663 when ligands were
grouped with SIMCOMP score of 0.5. Because the extremely ﬂex—
ible ligands are not relevant to biological functions of target proteins
and also grouping with SIMCOMP score of 0.5 only groups similar
ligands, the last row of Table 3 is the accuracy that is most relevant
to practical use of Patch—Surfer2.0. In Supplementary Table S2, the
accuracy was computed after further excluding ﬂexible ligands,
which have a ﬂexibility ratio over 0.7, 0.6 and 0.5. The accuracy im—
proved after more ligands were excluded but the largest improve—
ment was observed when the 10 ligands with the ﬂexibility ratio
>0.8 were excluded.

3.3 Prediction for apo proteins

We have further compared Patch—Surfer2.0’s performance on 32 apo
proteins with their counterpart of the holo proteins in the binding
pocket database (Supplementary Table S3). The results (Table 4;
Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. S3) show that the accuracy for apo
target proteins was not deteriorated, rather, higher than the results
for holo proteins. This is interesting but consistent with our previous
work (Sael and Kihara, 2012).

3.4 Comparison with other existing methods
In our previous papers, we have reported that the accuracy of the
original Patch—Surfer is higher than Pocket—Surfer (Chikhi et (11.,
2010) and four other similar pocket descriptors, 2D and pseudo—
Zernike descriptors, Legendre moments and spherical harmonics
(Sael and Kihara, 2012). Moreover, Patch—Surfer also showed better
prediction performance than the four existing methods ereek,
SiteBase, PROSURFER and XBSite2F (area under the curve, AUC,
was 0.86 for Patch_Surfer, and 0.49, 0.60, 0.57 and 0.55 for the
four methods, respectively; Kihara et (11., 2011). Additionally, in
Table 5, Patch—Surfer2.0 was compared with eF—Seek and a recently
developed method, APoc (Gao and Skolnick, 2013). Fifteen ligands
were used for this comparison.

Patch—Surfer2.0 showed higher relative partial AUC (Table 5)
than eF—Seek for all but one ligand. In comparison with APoc,

8The number of query pockets used for the comparison with eF-Seek (left)
and Apoc (right). The numbers are different because common entries between
the pocket databases by Patch-Surfer2.0 and eF—Seek were used as queries.
Only one number is shown when the number were the same for eF-Seek and
Apoc. The average AUC of receiver operator characteristic of the number of
queries are shown.

bFor the performance comparison with eF—Seek, we computed partial AUC
(pAUC) that is the AUC computed up to the maximum false-positive rate
(FPR) against the pAUC of the random retrieval up to the same FPR. Thus,
rel_pAUC = pAUC/pAUCmmlom where pAUC = AUC/(1.0‘*maxFPR).

CAPoc was run locally using the same database as Patch—Surfer2.0.

Patch—Surfer2.0 showed higher AUC for 13 ligands and a tie for
NAD. The average relative partial AUC and AUC by Patch—
Surfer2.0 for the latter 10 ligands (ACR to PMP) were not lower
than those for the first five (AMP to NAD), which were used for par—
ameter optimization.

3.5 Examples of predictions
Finally, we show several examples of Patch—Surfer2.0 predictions. In
Supplementary Table S4, we show a typical example of a search re—
sult. The query was a NAD binding pocket (glucose dehydrogenase,
1gco_A). Among the top ten matched pockets, four of them bind
NAD, three of them bind nicotinamide—adenine—dinucleotide phos—
phate (PDB code: NAP) or nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide
(DND), which are similar to NAD with SIMCOMP score of 0.88
and 0.87, respectively. The rest of the three ligands are BEI
(Inhibitor Bea322) and two cases where multiple small ligands bind
to the pockets. BEI is similar to NAD in size and has two aromatic
rings as NAD does. The latter two cases show similarity to NAD in
terms of size when the total size of ligands in the pockets is con—
sidered and has common local structures.

Figure 5 shows examples of ligand binding pockets identified at
a high rank for query pockets. Figure 5A and B are binding pockets
for S—adenosylmethionine (SAM). B1 is an example of retrieved
pocket that has a similar global structure as well as similar pocket
shape to the query protein. In contrast, B2 is a case that the retrieved
protein is not structurally similar and also the ligand binds in a

B1 and 32 are retrieved pockets for 2plw-A at the rank 1 and 6, respectively,

spectively. C, a query, 1gcoiA. D1 and D2 are retrieved pockets for 1gco,A at

different conformation from the query, which indicates that the
pocket shape is different to the query. In the second example, Figure
5 C and D are NAD binding pockets. Both of the two retrieved pock—
ets, D1 and D2 are from different global structures. TM—score
(Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) is less than 0.5 for both proteins to the
query. The first one (Fig. 5D1) has a similar pocket shape with an
RMSD of NAD of 1.0A, while the second one (Fig. 5D2) binds
NAD in a different conformation. These examples illustrate that
Patch—Surfer 2.0 identifies pockets of the same ligand type that have
different overall shapes and locate in a protein of globally different
structures.

4 Discussion and conclusion

We have presented Patch—Surfer2.0, which compares a query pocket
to known ligand binding pockets and predicts binding ligand mol—
ecules for the query. Among the five major technical improvements
that have driven the method to achieve substantially higher accuracy
than the original Patch—Surfer, APPS had the largest contribution to
the highest accuracy among the individual score components. APPS
captures not only positions of patches in a pocket but also reﬂects the
size of the pocket. By using a patch representation of pockets, Patch—
Surfer2.0 recognizes pockets for the same ligand by identifying com—
mon local regions in pockets, even if the global folds of the proteins
are different and the pockets do not share a common global shape.

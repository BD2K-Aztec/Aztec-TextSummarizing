ABSTRACT

Motivation: Normalization is critical in DNA copy number analysis.
We propose a new method to correctly identify two-copy probes
from the genome to obtain representative references for normalization
in single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. The method is based on a
two-state Hidden Markov Model. Unlike most currently available
methods in the literature, the proposed method does not need to
assume that the percentage of two-copy state probes is dominant
in the genome, as long as there do exist two-copy probes.

Results: The real data analysis and simulation study show that the
proposed algorithm is successful in that (i) it performs as well as the
current methods (e.g. CGHnormaliter and popLowess) for samples
with dominant two-copy states and outperforms these methods for
samples with less dominant two-copy states; (ii) it can identify the
copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity; and (iii) it is efficient in terms of
the computational time used.

1 INTRODUCTION

Copy number alterations (CNAs) have been associated with
many genomic disorders (Fanciulli et al., 2007; Yang et al.,
2007). Insertion or deletion of DNA sequences can directly alter
the gene expression levels, and thus potentially cause genetic dis-
eases (McCarroll et al., 2007). For example, in a St. Jude study
of >200 B-progenitor and T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) patients, >50 recurring regions of CNAs were identiﬁed.
In addition, many of these recurring CNAs were speciﬁc to dif-
ferent subtypes of ALL, associated with prognosis, indicating that
resistance to therapy in ALL might be caused by speciﬁc genetic
changes (Mullighan, 2009). In another St. Jude study, deletion,
ampliﬁcation and other types of CNAs were found to be in 40%
of B-progenitor ALL cases (Mullighan et al., 2007).

Facilitated by the Human Genome Project, the development
in comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) array technology
has made it indispensable for CNA study. Among many types

of CGH arrays, the single nucleotide polymorphism-CGH
(SNP-CGH) array is widely used because of its high resolution
and its ability to provide genotype estimates (Curtis et al., 2009;
Scharpf et al., 2008; Ylstra et al., 2006). Although advances in
next-generation sequencing are rapidly changing the landscape
of genetics, the SNP-CGH array offers a cost-effective way in
CNA studies, complementary to next-generation sequencing
(Przybytkowski et al., 2011). In addition, the SNP—CGH array
has advantages in voluminous, publicly available data and a
wealth of data analysis tools. Integrative analysis of genomic
data generated from different platforms requires SNP—CGH
data of high quality.

The raw signals from the SNP—CGH array are inherently noisy
because of sampling and/or technical variation. To reduce such
noise, the logarithms of signal intensity ratios between tumor and
normal samples from the same individual are usually used for
CNAs detection (Mullighan et al., 2007). A large portion of the
sampling variation may be removed this way because of strong
similarities between paired tumor and normal samples. In add-
ition, tumor/normal pairs are expected to be run in the same
laboratory and in the same batch to remove experimental vari-
ations as much as possible.

Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) describes the loss of normal
function of one allele in a gene, and LOH detection plays an
important role in discovering DNA segments that harbor
tumor suppression genes (Staaf et al., 2008). Copy-neutral LOH
(anOH) refers to duplication of one of the two alleles and con-
currently loss of the other allele, so that there is no change in a
DNA copy number. As a result, it is difﬁcult to detect anOH
by conventional copy number measurements. On the other hand,
the methods for accurate anOH detection often require both
tumor and control samples from the same patient.

Many statistical models and algorithms have been proposed
for CGH array-based CNA analysis (Fridlyand et al., 2004;
Hupe et al., 2004; Marioni et al., 2006; Olshen et al., 2004).
Normalization is critical for obtaining biologically meaningful
results. An appropriate normalization method should be able
to substantially remove systematic variations, while signal
changes because of biological alterations are preserved. Some
of the early CGH data normalization methods directly adopt
those developed for microarray gene expression, such as
Quantile normalization, Rank-invariant set normalization,
Lowess normalization and so forth (Chen et al., 2008; Pounds
et al., 2009). A fundamental assumption in these algorithms is

that the distributions of the log-signal intensities from all samples
are the same. However, this assumption may not hold in a CNA
study. For example, nearly all solid tumor cancers exhibit
whole-chromosome gains/losses (De Vita et al., 2008), and the
proportion of gain/loss probes in the tumor genome can vary
substantially from sample to sample. These translate into sub-
stantial differences in distributions of log signal intensities of
different tumor samples. Therefore, directly applying normaliza-
tion algorithms developed for gene expression data might result
in ‘over-normalization’ of segments of CNAs (van Houte et al.,
2009). To address this problem, several methods have been pro-
posed specifically for CGH array normalization. For example,
based on genotype calls and log-ratio of signal intensities, a ref-
erence alignment method identifies chromosomes in two-copy
state, which are then used as internal references in normaliza-
tion/alignment (Pounds et al., 2009). One problem in this method
is that the number of reference chromosomes identiﬁed is usually
small, and thus they might not represent the two-copy probes
well. Another method, popLowess, identiﬁes probes in two-copy
state using k-means clustering on the segmented mean values,
and subsequently normalizes the data by Lowess regression
using probes identiﬁed as references (Staaf et al., 2007). The
weakness of this approach lies in that only coarse separation
can be achieved because of probe pre—selection, and that
k-means clustering requires a pre-determined number of clusters.
The ridge-tracing normalization method normalizes CGH data
by applying ridgeline regression on the highest ridgeline of a 2D
log-intensity distribution and then using the expectation maxi-
mization algorithm to centralize the copy number ratio. This
method assumes that the most frequently occurring copy
number probes correspond to the two-copy states (Chen et al.,
2008). More recently, iterative normalization strategies, such as
ITALICS (for one-channel array) and CGHnormaliter (for
two-channel array), have been proposed (Rigaill et al., 2008;
van Houte et al., 2009). In both cases, segmentation is the key
step, and the subsequent normalization depends on the results of
segmentation. TumorBoost (Bengtsson et al., 2010) was de-
veloped to normalize the allele B fraction in tumor, whereas
total copy number signals are not normalized.

In this article, we propose a new normalization procedure for
SNP array data. This is motivated by the following reasons.
(i) Although applying paired samples in experimental design
could substantially reduce noise in data, estimating the true
copy number is often complicated by other experimental and
biological factors, such as imperfect dissection of the primary
tumors, the existence of the multiple clones in the tumor cell
population, ploidy of a sample, the spatial signal variation and
so forth. These factors can reduce the expected signalinoise ratio
(SNR) and make it difﬁcult to accurately estimate the true under-
lying copy number (Fridlyand et al., 2004). As a result, the con-
ventional segmentation methods such as circular binary
segmentation (CBS) (Olshen et al., 2004), which works well in
partitioning a SNP sequence into segments of the same under-
lying copy number, do not provide estimation of the underlying
copy number for each segment. (ii) Almost all current normal-
ization methods do not take into consideration the existence of
anOH. Since the mean value of probes in a anOH segment
may be slightly different (but not significantly) from the mean
value of probes in segments with true normal two-copy state, it is

difficult to identify and subsequently remove them from the
reference probe set. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new
strategies that have strong statistical power in distinguishing
probes in two-copy state from those having CNAs and simultan-
eously take into account the existence of anOH.

We will brieﬂy present Affymetrix SNP arrays in the next
section, and then describe the proposed algorithm in two parts.
The ﬁrst part is to partition probes into the segments of UMS
(uni-modal state, deﬁned in Section 2) or BM S (bi-modal state)
using a Hidden Markov Model (HMIll). The second part is to
apply the CBS segmentation method on the piecewise average
log-ratio (PAZog—Ratio, defined in Section 2.3) to separate probes
in two-copy state and other even-number copy number states.
The application of our method on a publicly available dataset,
followed by a comparison of our method with two currently
available methods, is presented in Section 3. At the end of the
article, we discuss the advantages and limitations of our method
and possible improvements.

2 METHODS

2.1 Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 500K array

There are several widely used SNP-CGH array platforms, including
Affymetrix genome-wide human SNP Array 5.0, GeneChip® Mapping
500K Array and Illumina Inﬁnium whole-genome SNP array. In this
article, we will focus on the Affymetrix GeneChip® Mapping 500 K
array. But the method we are proposing can be applied to data obtained
from other platforms as well.

The GeneChip® Human Mapping 500K Array Set consists of Nsp
and Sty arrays. These two arrays are digested with NspI restriction and
StyI restriction enzymes separately, each having the capacity to interro-
gate ~250 000 SNPs. At the SNP level, each SNP is interrogated by $10
probe quartets, each of which is composed of a 25 base pair (bp) perfect
match (PA!) oligonucleotide probe and a mismatch (MAJ) probe for
alleles A and B (Rigaill et al., 2008). There are 24410 different 25 bp
oligonucleotide probes per SNP.

We ﬁrst deﬁne the log ratios of the PM probes A and B for SNP i of
the tumor and normal samples as,

211 T<A>ij 1 211 T(B)ij
— - ng—a
"i 1'

211 CM»; 1 2111 Cam
_ _ ogz _
n _

T,- = log2 nd

Ci = 10g2

where T(A),-j and Tum-j (COW and C(13)?) are the raw intensities of the PM
probes A and B in the jth probe quartet for SNP i of the tumor (paired
normal) sample, respectively. As explained in Irizarry et a]. (2003), we will
only use the PM probe data in our method. Further, using the PM probes
only will allow our method to be readily used on newer generations of
SNP arrays, where only PM probes are included (Carvalho et al., 2007).

Genotyping calls for normal samples usually can achieve 99% accur-
acy (Scharpf et al., 2008), thus, it is feasible to accurately identify hetero-
zygous probes in normal samples. Hence, we can deﬁne the allelic log
ratios (dog-Ratio) of the PM probes A and B for heterozygous SNP i of
the paired tumor and normal samples as:

Additionally, we deﬁne the log-intensities of the paired tumor and normal

samples for SNP ias:

and the log-Ratio as: Y,- =  — c;. The corresponding log-ratio for het-
erozygous SNP i is denoted as th2). Note that, in calculating alog—Ratio
of the PM probes, we ﬁrst take the average of the raw signal intensities of
all quartets of a probe, then take the logarithm, instead of averaging after
taking the logarithm of the raw intensities. We explained in the
Supplementary Data that the normality assumptions on dalog—Ratio
and log-Ratio hold in both cases (see S] in Supplementary Data for de-
tails). In practice, by averaging the raw signal intensities ﬁrst, we observed
less pronounced saturation effects (data not shown).

In addition, under an ideal situation (Gardina et al., 2008), the rela-
tionship between dalog-Ratio and log-Ratio for heterozygous probes with
one-copy gain/loss can be expressed as (see S2 in Supplementary Data for
details):

E<O$2> % log2(2E(Y12))+1 — 1),

where E<O$ﬁ3 (or E YE) is the expected change(s) in dalog—Ratio
(or log-Ratio) of heterozygous probes with one-copy gain(+)/loss(—)
comparing with normal two-copy heterozygous probes. By using
dalog—Ratio instead of B allele frequency (BAF) in our proposed
method, we can avoid the unnecessary data manipulation as required
for computing BAF values; in the meantime, no useful information is lost.

Next, we will present our proposed method, the PAIR algorithm,
which consists of two parts. Part I applies a two-state HMM model
on dalog—Ratio values to coarsely identify probes in two-copy state, and
then Part II reﬁnes the results obtained from Part I by using CBS
segmentation.

2.2 The PAIR algorithm—Part I: partition probes into
UMS and BMS using HMM model

The HMM approach is intrinsically suitable for analyzing data with un-
observable (missing) variablesithe hidden states. In general, a discrete
state HMM with continuous output includes the following components
(Fridlyand et al., 2004; Rabiner, 1989).

(i) Let K be the number of hidden states (discrete). In this article, we
will consider a Markov process with two states (K: 2), with S1
being the UMS, including all genotypes that have equal number
of A and B alleles (i.e. 00, AB, AABB, AAABBB and so forth),
and S2 being the BMS including all other genotypes (see SS in
Supplementary Data for details).

(ii) Let 711 and 112 be the initial probabilities of the two states in (i),
where 111 + 112 = 1. It has been shown that for HMM, with a
continuous distribution output, the initial values for 11 and the
state transition probability matrix T (deﬁned next) can be chosen
arbitrarily (Rabiner, 1989). Thus, we can assign, for example,
111 = 0.8, and 112 = 0.2 as the initial probabilities for the two
states, given that the two-copy state in most cases dominates.
However, assigning any other moderate values would be
acceptable.

(iii) Denote Tm" = P(s, = SmlsH = S"), 1 5 m,n 5 K, and the state
transition probability matrix T: {Tmn}. We assigned a small
value (0.0001) to the probability of changing from UMS to
BMS (that is,T12 = 0.0001) on the assumption that there are
on average a few to around dozens of CNAs in the whole
genome of a tumor sample. Consequently, the probability of
staying in the UMS is 0.9999. Further, to avoid ‘over-
normalization’ of probes with copy number gain/loss, and also
to take into account the often large number of reference

two-copy state probes used in normalization, we are prone to
be conservative in calling a probe in UM S versus BM S . Thus, we
assigned an even smaller value (0.00001) to the probability of
changing from BMS to UMS (T21 = 0.00001).

Denote b1(0) and b2(0) as the emission probabilities for UMS and
BMS, respectively. In our HMM model, the observation 0 is the differ-
ence of allelic log-Ratio of the heterozygous probes. Further, under the
normality assumption of dalog—Ratio, b1(0) is a normal density with
p.20, and variance 02, and b2(0) is the density of a mixture of two
normal distributions (BMS) with means )1. and —p., and the same com-
ponent variance 02. Here, we also assume that the two modes of the BM S
have equal weight because we do not expect an association between allele
type and CNAs, and thus allele A is affected as often as allele B (see SS in
Supplementary Data for details). In addition, we assume the variance of
b1(0) and the component variances of b2(0) are the same for the case of
one-copy gain situation for simpliﬁcation. Note that the component vari-
ances of b2(0) can be larger for other types of CNAs. However, this is
not a concern for our model, as in those situations, )1. is much larger, and
a moderate change in component variance does not affect UMS and
BMS partition (see Supplementary Fig. Sl).

Given the HMM, we used Viterbi algorithm (Rabiner, 1989; Viterbi,
1967) to compute the probability of the most probable state sequence.

The distribution of probes that are in the BMS may be complicated.
For example, there may be tumors that simultaneously have, say, seg-
ments of one-copy gain, one-copy loss, anOH and two-copy gain. As a
result, a bi-modal distribution would not be sufﬁcient to model it.
However, among these gains/losses and anOH, one-copy gain is the
most difﬁcult one to detect (see S4 in Supplementary Data), except for
some minor clone caused by CNAs that might not be detectable at all.
Thus beneﬁting from this inequality, algorithms that detect one-copy gain
will automatically detect other types of odd-number gain/loss, anOH
and certain types of even-number gain/loss.

To detect segments of one-copy gain, we applied a HMM with three
iterations. In the ﬁrst iteration, we set the initial values for the variance of
b1(0) and the component variance of b2(0) in the HMM equal to the
sample variance (0%) of the whole sequence of observations (dalog-Ratio
values). When there is none or only focal gains/losses, this sample vari-
ance is supposed to be close to the true variance. Otherwise, when there
exist large segments of gain/loss, the value of 03 will be bigger than the
true variance of probes in UMS, but smaller than the true mixture dis-
tribution variance of probes in BMS. As a result, probes with larger
variance tend to ﬁt the BMS better, and probes with smaller variance
tend to ﬁt the UMS better. Thus, a meaningful initial partition can be
obtained with such choice of the initial values of variances. In the second
iteration, we used the estimation of the variance of probes in the UMS
(detected from iteration 1) as the input in the HMM model. And the third
iteration is a repeat of the second iteration. Note that, when the SNR is
high, the two states can be easily separated, and when the SNR is low, the
power for distinguishing the two states from each other depends more on
the means ()1. and —p.) of the two component distributions. Theoretically,
additional iterations may be run until a convergence criterion is met.
However, in practice, we observed that two or three iterations are usually
sufﬁcient to get a decent normalization result.

We comment that to have large power to identify one-copy gain, it
makes sense to set )1. as small as possible while controlling false-positive
rate. Based on our simulation, by setting )1. at ~2 standard deviations of a
sequence of random normally distributed observations, we can control
the false-positive rate at a 5% level. In practice, we noticed that setting )1.
close to any value between 1.9 and 2 standard deviations of the whole
sequence (for ﬁrst iteration), or observations in UM S (detected by previ-
ous iteration), can achieve decent results of separation between UM S and
BMS, even for noisy samples. And minor changes in n, such as :l:0.05,
would not affect the separation result except for some focal gains/losses.
This is in concordance with Supplementary Data S7, where we show that

S.Yang et al.

 

the expected dalog—Ratio value of one-copy gain is >1 standard deviation
of the two-copy probes if the sample contamination rate is 512%. Note
that, we made conservative assumptions in Supplementary Data S7.
In practice, we were able to obtain good separation of UMS and BMS
for all samples we tested.

Detection of homozygous deletions (HDs) is much easier and can be
achieved by applying the same HMM model to the dalog—Ratios of
all probes (both homozygous and heterozygous probes). The variances
of HD segments could be as small as 1/5 of the variances of other
segments, thus these HDs could be easily identified in one iteration (see
Supplementary Fig. S2).

As the final step of Part I, we mapped the probes in BMS back to the
original whole sequence (including both homozygous and heterozygous
probes) and considered the probes within two consecutive BM S probes as
CNA probes. After excluding these CNAs and HD probes, all remaining
probes are called the initial reference set.

2.3 The PAIR algorithm—Part II: detecting probes
in two-copy state by applying CBS on piecewise
average log-ratio

Let 1,,1' = 1, 2, ..., I, be the sequence of points where copy number
changes occur. Assume that Y,- is a sequence of independent random
variables with normal distribution Y,- ~ N(p,,-, 02), where
Ti<t S Ti+1,i= 0,1,2, ...,], and 0 = To<11<  <‘E[+1 = T. 111 this
article, the variables Y,- represent the logarithm of signal-intensity ratio
described in Section 2.1.

Divide the whole sequence of random variables into subsequences of
equal size, with m random variables (elements) in each subsequence (the
last one might have less than m random variables). We then obtain a new
sequence of random variables,

min(pm,T)
Mp: Z Yjapzlazama

j=l+(p*1)m

the average of all random variables within each subsequence, and term it
the piecewise average log-ratio (PAlog-Ratio). Here, M p was calculated
by taking the average of m (= 100) consecutive log-Ratio values in the
whole sequence, including homozygous ones. Note that the reasons to use
m = 100 are 2-fold: (i) the computation is much faster and (ii) the bias in
segment-mean estimate introduced by using PAlog-Ratios instead of raw
log-Ratios is negligible.

The execution of Part II started with a modality test (Hasselbla, 1966)
on PAlog-Ratios for all probes in the initial reference set. Based on BIC
(Schwarz, 1978), if a uni-modal distribution ﬁts well, all probes in the
initial reference set would be two-copy probes and will be used as the
references in subsequent normalization. Otherwise, if a multiple-modal
distribution ﬁts well, the estimated mean log-Ratio of the component
distribution with the smallest mean would be used as the mean of
two-copy probes. Next, after applying CBS segmentation to
PAlog-Ratio values (HD and one-copy loss probes have been excluded
by Part I), we removed any segments whose mean log-Ratio values are
greater than the median of the mean log-ratios of one-copy gain segments
(see SS in the Supplementary Data for the criteria to detect segments of
one-copy gain/loss) and used the probes remaining in the initial reference
set as the reference set. In cases where only segments of one-copy loss
exist, we imputed the one-copy gain value by multiplying the absolute
change of one-copy loss by 0.58. If neither a one-copy gain nor a
one-copy loss segment was detected in Part I, we simply used a 95%
conﬁdence interval about the two-copy mean as the cut-off values.

2.4 Normalization via spline smoothing

After identifying probes in the two-copy state, normalization was carried
out using an MiA plot, where the log-Ratio (ill) was plotted against the

log mean intensity (A). Note that A is the average of tumor and the paired
normal sample log intensities (Smyth and Speed, 2003). We obtained M
and A values for each probe, and set the median of M values of the
probes (all probes for normal sample, and two-copy probes only for
tumor sample) as 0. Then, we used the M and A values of probes in
the two-copy state to create a spline smoothing curve (Chambers et al.,
1992). The corrected M values for all probes based on the smoothing
curve are the normalized log-Ratio values, where the median of normal-
ized M values of the probes in the two-copy state equals 0.

2.5 An option for normalizing noisy data

We have assumed that the distributions of the log-intensities of A and B
alleles of heterozygous SNPs on the same array are the same. In other
words, the log-intensities of probes with genotypes AA, AB and BB are
supposed to have the same distribution. However, in practice, they may
be somewhat different because of unexpected sources of variation.
For example, anOH (exclusively AA or BB genotypes) should have
the same mean log-Ratio as those of normal two-copy segments
(including probes with AA, AB and BB genotypes), but minor differences
do exist because of the fact that log-intensities of probes with AB geno-
type can be higher/lower than those of probes with AA or BB genotype.
To correct this, especially for arrays with choppy signals, we used spline
smoothing to normalize tumor and normal log-intensities separately
before normalizing the log-Ratios. To normalize log-intensities, we
plotted the log intensity of the tumor (or normal) sample versus the
log-ratio of A and B alleles of the tumor (or normal) sample.

2.7 Simulation study

To evaluate how the proportion of two-copy probes affects the normal-
ization result, we simulated the SNP array data by re-sampling one-copy
gain/loss and two-copy probes from a tumor-control pair, where three
normalization methods, CGH-normaliter, PAIR and popLowess, gave
similar normalization results. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst randomly ﬁlled the
whole genome with one-copy gain/loss probes, such that all probes in
each chromosome (or chromosome arm) have the same copy numberi
either one-copy gain or one-copy loss. To maintain the correlation

structure, the log-intensities of alleles A and B for the paired tumor and
normal samples and the genotype for the normal sample of the same SNP
were sampled simultaneously. Then, we randomly replaced some of the
one-copy gain/loss segments with the two-copy probes to have a
pre-deﬁned proportion of two-copy probes in the genome. That is, we
randomly picked a chromosome (or arm) and ﬁlled it with two-copy
probes and repeated this process until the pre-deﬁned proportion was
reached. Finally, we applied all three normalization methods to each
simulated data, and calculated the rate of the two-copy probes correctly
identiﬁed by each method. These rates are presented and compared in
Section 3.6.

3 RESULTS

We demonstrated the performance of PAIR algorithm by apply-
ing it to a public dataset, where 114 multiple myeloma samples
were analyzed by Affymetrix 500K array set (Nsp + Sty).
Among them, 80 samples have matched peripheral blood DNA

3.1 Partitioning heterozygous probes into segments of
UMS and BMS

By Part I of the PAIR algorithm, a two-state HMM model was
applied to dalog—Ratio, and the heterozygous probes were parti-
tioned into segments of UMS and BMS. The partition result is
presented in Figure 2. In Figure 2a, probes in black color are
those that follow a uni-modal distribution (the UMS segments),
and probes in red color are those that follow a bi-modal distri-
bution (the BMS segments). It is clearly indicated by the 95%
conﬁdence lines (in red) that probes in the UM S segments have
smaller variance than those in the BMS segments do (see S6 in
Supplementary Data for details). Note that any two-copy probe,
if it exists, has to be within one of UM S segments. This is the key
to ensure no misclassiﬁcation of probes in two-copy state or in
one-copy gain/loss. On the other hand, a UMS segment might
include probes with certain types of even-number gain, such as
AABB, AAABBB and so forth. This justiﬁes the necessity of
Part II of the PAIR algorithm. For example, from Figure 2C4
the plot of log-Ratios of the whole-genome with BMS probes
being colored in red, the majority of probes on chromosomes
24, 7712, 14, 1&17 and 19722 are in UMS, but the probes
on chromosome 9 are in two-copy gain instead of two-copy
state. The explanation for chromosome 9 being partitioned
into the UMS segment is that the genotypes of heterozygous
probes on this chromosome are presumably AABB, instead of
AAAB/ABBB.

3.2 Identifying probes in two-copy state from all probes in
the initial reference set

By Part II of the PAIR algorithm, we aim to separate probes in
two-copy state from the segments of the initial reference set.
Based on the fact that the mean log-Ratio of probes in a
two-copy gain segment is higher than that of probes in a
one-copy gain segment, we concluded by Part II that chromo-
some 9, which was originally partitioned into the initial reference
set, was a two-copy gain chromosome. In general, the segments
with copy number gain of higher magnitude can be excluded

Fig. 2. An illustration of applying PAIR algorithm to one of the paired
samples. (a) The application of Part I of the PAIR algorithmisegments
of UM S and BMS were outlined by the two standard deviation conﬁ-
dence interval lines of each segment (in red). Probes in segments of UM S
have the smallest conﬁdence interval (variance), that is, chromosomes 27
4, 7712, 14, 16, 17 and 19722. Probes in segments of BMS have larger
variances of different scales owing to the different nature of gain/loss,
that is, probes on chromosome 5 and 15, and part of chromosome 6 has
one-copy gain, probes on chromosome 13 have one-copy loss and
chromosome 18 and part of chromosome 1 are segments of anOH.
(b) The application of Part II of the PAIR algorithmiCBS segmentation
was applied to the PAlog-Ratio. (c) The reﬂection of Part I UMS and
BMS partition on log-ratio values. The black and red colors represent
segments of UM S and BMS detected in Part I, respectively. Probes on
chromosome 9, which have two-copy gains, were largely in UMS. (d) The
reﬂection of applying CBS on log-ratio values. Chromosome 9 was
re-identiﬁed as a segment of two-copy gain by CBS segmentation.
Chromosome 18 and part of chromosome 1, both of which were
anOH, were not identiﬁed as CNAs

from the reference set by Part II because their mean log-Ratios
are higher than those of one-copy gain segments. After applying
Part II, segments remaining in the reference set predominately
consist of two-copy probes. By subtracting the median of
log-Ratios of these two-copy probes from the raw log-Ratios of
all probes, we obtained the centralized log-Ratio values.

We comment that (i) it may be difﬁcult to accurately identify
CNAs by conventional segmentation methods alone. For ex-
ample, chromosome 18 is in anOH (Fig. 2a), but it cannot be
detected by conventional methods (Fig. 2c) because anOH is
also two-copy. (ii) Although chromosomes 24, 16 and 17 are all
two-copy chromosomes, there is a drift in segment mean along
chromosomes (Fig. 2b). As a result, the segment means of
PAIog—Ratio values of probes on chromosomes 16 and 17 are
lower than those of probes on chromosomes 24 (the reference
cyan line represents 0). This may result in assigning incorrect
copy numbers to those chromosomes. In contrast, the
dalog—Ratio plot (Fig. 2a) is symmetric about 0 for all the
chromosomes, and the variations of dalog—Ratio values of
probes on chromosomes 24, 16 and 17 are among the smallest,
indicating that all these chromosomes are in UMS, and poten-
tially in two-copy state.

We applied Part I of the PAIR algorithm to achieve two goals:
(i) to identify segments that contain probes in two-copy state;
(ii) to detect segments of anOH, such as chromosome 18 and

part of chromosome 1 in the aforementioned example. In the
extreme cases where there are no two-copy probes in the whole
genome, some additional work is needed. A brief discussion can
be found in Section 4. Based on the fact that two-copy hetero-
zygous probes follow a uni-modal normal distribution, by parti-
tioning probes into UMS and BMS, we can conﬁdently exclude
probes in BM S from the reference set. On the other hand, con-
ventional segmentation methods, such as CBS, were neither de-
signed to accurately assign the true underlying copy number to
segments that have the same copy number, nor to detect seg-
ments of anOH. For example, the mean log-Ratio values of
probes on chromosome 18 and a part of chromosome 1 are
close to those of probes in normal two-copy segments, thus it
is difﬁcult to distinguish them from the normal two-copy probes.
Nevertheless, CBS (adopted in Part II) has greater power for
detecting higher-magnitude change of mean log-Ratio value.
In the aforementioned example, CBS provided satisfactory
result for detecting two-copy gains of chromosome 9.

3.3 Normalization by an M—A plot

The result of normalization (by an MeA plot) is presented in
Supplementary Figure S3. As a quicker alternative to Lowess
regression, spline smoothing was used in computing the correc-
tion curve. The advantage of using spline function over polyno-
mial regression is to avoid distortion, especially at the left and
right tails (Chen et al., 2008).

3.4 Comparing with CGHnormaliter, popLowess
normalization methods and others

The R/Bioconductor package ‘CGHnormaliter’ and a standalone
version of R code for popLowess were used to normalize the data
for the purpose of comparison. Normalized data were then seg-
mented using CBS to Visualize the results. In many cases, three
algorithms, CGHnormaliter, PAIR and popLowess, generated
almost the same normalized data. However, when the proportion
of two-copy probes is not predominantly high, both
CGHnormaliter and popLowess may have difﬁculties in cor-
rectly centralizing the normalized data. Using the sample with
ID 303 as an example, our method (Fig. 3b) centralized the data
around the mean log-Ratio values of chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 7, 9,
15, 19 and 20. CGHnormaliter (Fig. 3c), however, centralized the
data around the mean log-Ratio values of chromosomes 1, 4, 6,
8, 10, 12714, 16, 21 and 22. We highlighted those probes that
have AB genotype calls in normal, but AA or BB in tumor (see
the probes in red color in Figure 3; probes that do not have this
change are in black color). As most of the probes that have
heterozygosity loss are located in chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 8, 10,
12714, 16, 21 and 22, we assume that these chromosomes are the
one-copy loss chromosomes.

PopLowess (Fig. 3d) was able to centralize the data similarly
to our method, the mean log-Ratio values of the reference
chromosomes, especially chromosomes 9, 15, 19 and 20, were
slightly different from 0. The possible reason is that the
k-mean cluster approach used in popLowess does not provide
precise estimates of cluster means.

In another sample, CGHnormaliter and PAIR obtained simi-
lar normalization results, but popLowess picked different
chromosomes as the reference (see Supplementary Fig. S4).

and the mean log-ratio of neither of the two dominating copy number
states was close to 0. (b) The PAIR normalized data. The total number of
segments was 40, and the mean log-ratio values of the segments in
two-copy state, that is, chromosomes 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 19 and 20, were
~0. (c) The CGHnormaliter normalized data. The total number of seg-
ments was 65, the mean log-ratio values of chromosomes, that is, 1, 4, 6,
8, 10, 12714, 16, 21 and 22, were ~0. (d) The popLowess normalized data.
The total number of segments was 50; however, the horizontal cyan line,
which indicates no CNAs, was slightly different from the mean log-ratio
values of chromosomes, that is, 9, 11, 15, 19 and 20, indicating there
might be some problems with the centralization process

We also compared PAIR to other methods, such as Quantile
(Bolstad et al., 2003), Invariant Set (Li and Wong, 2001) and
I TALICS (see Supplementary Figure S5). The ﬁgure indicates
that PAIR is the method that is able to set ‘0’ at approximately
the median of a copy number population.

3.5 Optional normalization of tumor and normal
log-intensity separately

The allelic MeA plot of probes in two-copy state is theoretically
centered about a horizontal line, as the probes with AA, AB and
BB genotypes are supposed to have the same log-intensity
values. However, the real data often show that the pattern of
log-intensity values deviates from a horizontal line, the superim-
posed spline smoothing white lines in Figure 4a for a tumor
sample and c for the paired normal sample. Using paired samples
could normally neutralize the effect of such differences if the
pattern for the tumor sample is coincident with that of the
paired normal sample. Nevertheless, should the patterns for
the paired samples be more divergent, optionally normalizing
the log-intensities of tumor (based on the PAIR identiﬁed
two-copy probes) and the paired sample separately before nor-
malizing log-Ratios might be necessary to improve the quality of
normalization.

The effects of the optional normalizations are presented in
Figure 5, where we plotted the PAIR normalized log-Ratio
with or without the optional individual sample normalization
in a or b. Figure 5c and d are the normalization results after
applying CGHnormaliter and popLowess. Comparing a and b,
we can see that applying the optional normalization resulted
in a large reduction in the total number of segments detected
by CBS. The reduction was also substantial if comparing
with CGHnormaliter and popLowess normalization results.

then the total log-intensity was the logarithm of the sum of A
and B allele intensities. For c and d, the log-intensities of A/B
alleles were calculated by taking the average of logarithms of the
raw A/B allele intensities of all quartets for a probe, and the total
log-intensity was the sum of the A and B allele log-intensities.
Figure 6a showed that the mean log-ratio of the anOH segment
was slightly different from those of the normal two-copy seg-
ments before individual normalization. The optional individual
normalization mitigated this difference (Fig. 6b). This effect was
much striking when comparing d and c. Note that for samples
that performed the optional normalization, segments of anOH
could be included in the reference set.

methods. All three methods perform equally well when the pro-
portion of two-copy probes is >50%. However, when this pro-
portion drops, neither CGHnormaliter nor popLowess provides
satisfactory normalization. The main reason is that the assump-
tion of these two methods is violated. In contrast, PAIR can
provide satisfactory normalization even when the proportion of
two-copy probes is as low as 10%.

4 DISCUSSION

Correctly identifying reference probes in two-copy state from
the SNP array is not trivial. We propose an algorithm, PAIR,
that can accurately distinguish two-copy state probes from those
with CNAs.

The proposed PAIR algorithm ﬁrst partitions the whole
genome into segments of UMS or BMS. The normal two-copy
probes, if they exist, can then be narrowed down to the segments
of UMS. This algorithm does not assume that two-copy probes
dominate the whole genome. This is an advantage compared
with the methods that require this assumption.

In contrast to the conventional methods, PAIR has the advan-
tage of being able to identify segments of anOH. This is pref-
erable, as the mean log-ratio values of probes in some anOH
segments can be different from those in normal two-copy seg-
ments, and this could cause a bias in the step of centralization
should the anOH segment be large. Furthermore, with the op-
tional allelic normalization, we are able to equalize the
log-intensities of A and B alleles, and thus remove one source
of false discovery.

We did not integrate log-Ratio and dalog—R analyses into the
HMM model, but instead, we adopted a two-step process.
In Part II, we applied CBS segmentation to PAlog—Ratios instead
of the raw log-Ratios. By doing so, we could substantially
reduce the computational time. Meanwhile, comparing with
the methods using log-Ratio, the risk of false detection can be
reduced if signal drift and uncorrected genomic wave exist
(Diskin et al., 2008).

We obtained the monotone relationship between log-Ratio
and dalog—Ratio, and proposed to use dalog—Ratio instead of
BAF in anOH detection and underlying copy number estima-
tion to avoid unnecessary data manipulation.

The proposed method reduced the computation time when
comparing with CGHnormaliter. For the samples with a large
number of segments, it takes only 375 min to complete the
normalization process using our method, but usually 2&30
min using CGHnormaliter, when the algorithms were run on
Lenovo T400 laptop.

CNAs are different from sample to sample, and sometimes can
be complicated. It may be difﬁcult to fully specify all CNA forms
by a HMM model. Bearing this in mind, the proposed two-state
model, although it might miss some focal CNAs, can greatly
reduce the risk of misclassiﬁcation of large segments of CNAs.
This, in our opinion, is sufﬁcient for a normalization method to
be acceptable.

One of the assumptions of the PAIR algorithm is that there
are at least some normal two-copy heterozygous probes in the
genome that need not to be dominated. The simulation result
shows that the PAIR algorithm has almost 100% power for
correctly detecting the normal two-copy states when the

proportion of two-copy state probes are as low as 10%. In the
extreme cases where Virtually no two-copy probes exist, that is,
the whole genome is in the same state, we could still determine
whether the whole genome is in one-copy gain/loss from
two-copy. It will be more challenging to accurately centralize
the probes. However, this is not the focus of this article.

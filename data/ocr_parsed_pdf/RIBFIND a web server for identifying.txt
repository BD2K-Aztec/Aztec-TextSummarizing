ABSTRACT

Motivation: To better analyze low-resolution cryo electron microscopy
maps of macromolecular assemblies, component atomic structures
frequently have to be flexibly fitted into them. Reaching an optimal
fit and preventing the fitting process from getting trapped in local
minima can be significantly improved by identifying appropriate rigid
bodies (RES) in the fitted component.

Results: Here we present the RIBFIND server, a tool for identifying
RES in protein structures. The server identifies RES in proteins by
calculating spatial proximity between their secondary structural
elements.

Availability: The RIBFIND web server and its standalone program are
available at http://ribfind.ismb.lon.ac.uk.

1 INTRODUCTION

Studying the structure and function of macromolecular assem-
blies using cryo electron microscopy (cryo EM) techniques is
becoming increasingly popular (Orlova and Saibil, 2011).
Interpreting the resulting 3D maps, which are typically at a reso-
lution range of ~5 to 25 A, is almost always performed by ﬁrst
ﬁtting atomic structures of assembly components (e.g. proteins,
domains and RNA segments) into them (Beck et al., 2011).
However, when the assembly components in the density map
are in a different conformation from their corresponding
atomic structures (Orlova and Saibil, 2011), fitting the compo-
nents rigidly may not result in a satisfying pseudo-atomic model.
To alleviate this problem, assembly components can be treated
ﬂexibly during the fitting process (ﬂexible fitting) (Beck et al.,
2011), i.e. by allowing changes in their conformation. In prin-
ciple, ﬂexible fitting can be applied in a hierarchical fashion at
any level of representation of the structure, such as domains,
secondary structural elements (SSEs), amino acids and even
individual atoms (Topf et al., 2008). In practice, due to the
increasing size of the search space, as the level of representa-
tion becomes finer, identifying appropriate rigid bodies (RBs)
can be Vital in reaching the optimal ﬁt. A prior knowledge of
the rigid and ﬂexible regions of the components can prevent

the fitting process from getting trapped into many of the
local minima (Ahmed and Gohlke, 2006; Pandurangan and
Topf, 2012).

There have been many program tools reported in the literature
to identify rigid and ﬂexible regions in proteins. Most of these
tools attempt to identify ‘compact units’ in proteins with strong
spatial relationship within them (Lesk and Rose, 1981). These
compact units can be arranged hierarchically, which can lead to
the prediction of a comprehensive set of protein dynamic path-
ways (Lesk and Rose, 1981). One such program uses a graph
theory-based approach to model the atomic structure of the mol-
ecule as a bond-bending network and applies a fast combinator-
ial algorithm to determine the rigidity of this network, thereby
the RBs of the molecule (FIRST) (Jacobs et al., 2001). Other
approaches to predict ﬂexible hinge regions in proteins include
elastic network models (e.g. HingePort) (Emekli et al., 2008),
energetic interactions within protein fragments (e.g.
FlexOracle) (Flores and Gerstein, 2007) and the identiﬁcation
of rigid blocks in proteins by comparing inter residue distances
of two different conformations (e. g. RigidFinder) (Abyzov et al.,
2010). We recently introduced RIBFIND, a method that identi-
ﬁes RBs by using spatial proximity between SSEs (Pandurangan
and Topf, 2012). Using the method to aid ﬂexible ﬁtting of pro-
tein components in low-resolution (15 A) cryo EM maps was
shown to improve the accuracy of the initial ﬁts by ~4l% on
average (Pandurangan and Topf, 2012; Topf et al., 2008). Here,
we present a web server and a standalone tool for RIBFIND.

2 METHODS

The RIBFIND method treats alpha helices and beta sheets as the
basic units and clusters them based on their spatial proximities.
Following that the group of SSEs in each cluster and the loops connecting
them are treated as one RB. SSEs that do not fall into any cluster are
treated as independent RBs. The clustering (which is independent of the
sequence continuity) is governed by two parametersithe residue ‘contact
distance’ and the ‘cluster cutoff. The contact distance is the distance
between the centroids of any two side chains. Its default value is 6.5 
(Pandurangan and Topf, 2012). The cluster cutoff is the percentage
of residues within two SSEs that are in contact. Its value can vary be-
tween 1 and 100%. As the value of the cluster cutoff increases, more
tightly packed clusters are likely to be identiﬁed. For a given value of
contact distance, RIBFIND computes a set of RBs at each possible clus-
ter cutoff value in increments of 1%, these sets of RBs can aid the user in
selecting the appropriate RBs for ﬂexible ﬁtting into cryo EM density
maps.

the protein, the number of RBs and the total number of SSEs that are present in RBs are shown in the right panel

To use RIBFIND, a web server has been set up. It accepts the follow-
ing inputs (Fig. 1a): (i) the protein coordinates in PDB ﬁle format (a
single chain or multiple chains with the residues numbered continuously);
(ii) a description of the protein SSEs in DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983)
format (optional, if not provided, the server automatically runs DSSP);
(iii) the value of the contact distance parameter; (iv) the email address of
the user and (v) a density map in MRC format (optional). The RIBFIND
client interface reads the input, validates it and submits it to the server for
execution. After completing the job the server sends an automatic email
to the user with a link to the results page. This page contains a Jmol
applet (http://jmol.sourceforge.net) showing a cartoon of the user PDB
ﬁle with each RB uniquely coloured. A11 SSEs and loops that are not part
of a cluster are coloured white. The RB set that is displayed by default is
the one that contains the maximal number of clusters identiﬁed by
RIBFIND [we previously showed that using this set in cryo EM ﬂexible
ﬁtting produced the best results in most cases (Pandurangan and Topf,
2012)]. Using the slider control on the result page, the user can View
different sets of RBs generated for each cluster cutoff and save the cor-
responding RB ﬁle in a text format [which can be used, e.g., by Flex-EM
(Topf et al., 2008)]. The standalone version of RIBFIND is provided on
the webpage. It also includes a script to aid the visualization of the RBs
using Chimera (www.cgl.ucsfedu/chimera). The program is written in
python and it requires the Biopython (http://biopython.org/) and
Numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org/) packages to be installed locally. It
takes about 5 min for a RIBFIND run to be completed for a protein
of ~800 residues on a single Intel Xeon 3-GHz processor.

3 CASE STU DY

We present the results of the RIBFIND server using the ‘close’
and ‘open’ conformations of the Escherichia coli ribose-binding
protein (271 residues) with the corresponding PDB ids: 2DRI

and lURP, respectively. Based on DSSP, the structure has a
total of 11 SSEs including nine helices and two beta sheets.
Running RIBFIND with a contact distance of 6.5  resulted
in four different sets of RBs for the following cluster cutoff
values: 2&33%, 34e35%, 3&37% and 38-50% (below 26% all
SSEs fall into one cluster and above 50% no clusters are found)
(Fig. like). The maximal number of three clusters was obtained
for a cluster cutoff of 36 and 37% (Fig. 1d). Using the latter set
of RBs during ﬂexible ﬁtting into the 10  resolution density
map of the open conformation (simulated from lURP), starting
from the close conformation of the protein (2DRI), was helpful
in reducing the Ca Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) be-
tween the two conformations from 7.55 to 1.71  (Pandurangan
and Topf, 2012). It is worth noting that in cases where the close
conformation is highly compact, identifying RBs by RIBFIND
may be difﬁcult and may not result in the open conformation
during ﬂexible ﬁtting into the corresponding open map (e. g. actin
subunit; Pandurangan and Topf, 2012).

4 CONCLUSION

The RIBFIND web server offers an automatic way of identifying
different sets of RBs in protein structures based on clustering of
SSEs. In addition to providing a tool for analyzing polypeptide
chains by shedding light on their ﬂexibility, it can be useful for
the reﬁnement of structures in the context of cryo EM maps.

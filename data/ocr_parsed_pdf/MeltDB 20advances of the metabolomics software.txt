ABSTRACT

Motivation: The research area metabolomics achieved tremendous
popularity and development in the last couple of years. Owing to its
unique interdisciplinarity, it requires to combine knowledge from vari-
ous scientific disciplines. Advances in the high-throughput technology
and the consequently growing quality and quantity of data put new
demands on applied analytical and computational methods.
Exploration of finally generated and analyzed datasets furthermore
relies on powerful tools for data mining and visualization.

Results: To cover and keep up with these requirements, we have
created MeltDB 2.0, a next-generation web application addressing
storage, sharing, standardization, integration and analysis of metabo-
lomics experiments. New features improve both efficiency and effect-
ivity of the entire processing pipeline of chromatographic raw data
from pre-processing to the derivation of new biological knowledge.
First, the generation of high-quality metabolic datasets has been
vastly simplified. Second, the new statistics tool box allows to inves-
tigate these datasets according to a wide spectrum of scientific and
explorative questions.

Availability: The system is publicly available at https://meltdb.cebitec.
uni-bielefeld.de. A login is required but freely available.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolomics research covers all aspects of the investigation of
small molecule metabolite compositions resulting from cellular
processes and constitutes an integrated part of systems biology
(Bino et al., 2004). Like transcriptomics and proteomics, meta-
bolomics is capable of measuring extrinsically initiated changes
in organisms. The metabolome, the entity of all small molecules
in a cell, organism or tissue, is considered to be the closest to the
phenotype of all ‘-omes’ (Fiehn, 2002).

Compared with other molecular levels or -omics methods,
metabolomics is challenging in its high degree of interdiscipli-
narity, interlinking experts from research ﬁelds as diverse as
engineering, physics, chemistry and biology and from cheminfor-
matics over bioinformatics to statistics, data mining and ﬁnally
Visualization.

Both sample acquisition and subsequent analysis are auto-
mated in high-throughput instruments, which has continuously
posed challenges on the systematic storage and computational
processing of the gathered experimental datasets, starting in the
early 2000s. The increasing number and quality of measurements
not only raised the generated data volume but also allowed to
address more complex biological questions within conducted ex-
periments. To comprehensively address these demands, bioinfor-
matics internet applications were developed. MeltDB, ‘a software
platform for the analysis and integration of data from metabolo-
mics experiments’, has been published by Neuweger et a]. (2008).
Xia et a]. (2009) released MetaboAnalyst, ‘a comprehensive tool
suite for metabolomic data analysis’. Carroll et a]. (2010) pub-
lished the MetabolomeExpress web server as ‘a public place to
process, interpret and share GC/MS metabolomics datasets’.

Since around 2008, we have observed that the requirements to
comprehensive metabolomics software platforms have changed:
The general growth of the ﬁeld of metabolomics and the increas-
ing number of collaborations diversified the user community of
researchers and their individual scientiﬁc goals. It is obvious that
the success of a metabolomics study depends on an efﬁcient and
effective collaboration of this interdisciplinary research commu-
nity. Thus, not only the availability and sharing of the data is
important but also special functions have to be signiﬁcantly ex-
tended with speciﬁc features to consider all researcher’s demands
and perspectives. In addition, the ever-increasing throughput and
the constant lack of time makes it immensely important that
automated pre-processing methods are reliable and that analyses
and manual intervention are fast and easy. Since Metabolomics
approaches are applied to more and more scientific objectives, a
powerful set of statistical methods is mandatory, ranging from
hypothesis-driven statistical tests to less speciﬁed and untargeted
data-mining methods, such as clustering and dimension reduc-
tion. Finally, the wealth of generated data poses a necessity for
exploratory data analysis tools and information Visualization.

To tackle these new challenges systematically, a next gener-
ation of bioinformatics tools needed to be developed, covering
all of the aforementioned aspects of metabolome data analysis,
ranging from processing raw data (RD) to ﬁnishing and ﬁnally
the derivation of biological knowledge. During the stages of that
process, one can identify four successive data categories that
represent different levels of data classiﬁcation and annotation
as well as different levels of abstraction. First, RD, stored
and organized in meaningful groups, build the basis. Then,
[ﬁe-processed data (PD) is computed, where peaks and their

quantities have been detected. It follows integrated data (ID),
where peaks that putatively originate from the same compound
are consistently annotated over chromatograms of an experiment
and thus become comparable. Last, derivative data (DD) is
achieved by statistical analyses of metabolite quantities in an
experiment and then Visualized to allow effective exploration
and to draw conclusions.

In this manuscript, we present MeltDB 2.0, which offers novel
tools to challenge the rising wealth of data quality and quantity
and support the analysis of all four categories RD, PD, ID and
DD and includes a multitude of updates. New and improved
preprocessing methods underpin the reliability of automatically
created annotations. At the same time, straightforward tools for
manual peak annotation simplify the curation even of large ex-
periments. To help answering questions of different scientiﬁc
objectives, the set of statistical analyses and data-mining tools
has been strongly enriched. To ﬁnally nail down the quintessence
of an experiments outcome, data exploration is supported by
new interactive and telling information Visualizations.

2 IMPLEMENTATION AND METHODS

The ﬁrst version of the MeltDB software platform, a three-tiered
web application and database server published in 2008
(Neuweger et al., 2008), provides means for the standardization,
systematic storage and analysis of gas chromatographyimass
spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics experiments. Within a
powerful project and user management, raw chromatograms of
various ﬁle formats can be uploaded and organized into chro-
matogram groups (e. g. replicates, factor levels) and experiments.
A ﬂexible processing pipeline allows to ﬁnd, quantify and iden-
tify peaks in the raw chromatograms. Subsequently, a set of
statistical tools and Visualizations can be applied to analyze the

 

 

gathered data tables. This fast growing, free online platform
today hosts >25 distinct projects conducted by >150 registered
users from around the world. More than 17 000 chromatograms
have been uploaded and analyzed yet.

In the following, all major improvements to the entire process
from RD to DD will be described in more details. Figure 1
summarizes the four stages of data processing and associates
Visualizations and data mining methods that can be performed
in MeltDB 2.0 to each stage.

2.1 From RD to PD: improved pre-processing

In metabolomics data analysis, pre-processing is a critical step, as
ID and DD build on PD. To ensure a reliable data basis for
statistical data exploration, MeltDB 2.0 is equipped with several
new and updated algorithms for the early steps of experiment
data analysis.

The growing list of pre-processing methods now includes sup-
port for the centWave algorithm by Tautenhahn et al. (2008) for
chromatographic peak detection, which features a high sensitiv-
ity, and updates of the XCMS package (Smith et al., 2006) for
chromatogram alignment and proﬁling analyses. In addition, the
ChromA (Hoffmann and Stoye, 2009) software is added to the
list of supported chromatogram alignment tools. ChromA com-
putes pairwise alignments of chromatograms without a priori
knowledge, but it is capable of optionally using previously
matched or identiﬁed peaks as anchor points, which speeds up
the process.

The calculation of retention time indices in GC-MS measure-
ments is improved and can now also be performed manually
using the web interface. Peaks of added substances can be as-
signed with retention indices and will be used as anchors for
interpolating other peaks retention indices (Ettre, 1994), which

Fig. 1. The overview shows the information processing in MeltDB 2.0 as well as visualizations and tools that are applicable to each level of data: RD,
PD, ID and DD. Although different chromatogram viewers are available immediately after RD upload, heatmaps and data matrices can only be
computed as soon as data have been integrated, i.e. there are peaks that are consistently named across chromatograms. To ﬁnally derive knowledge from

the data, MeltDB 2.0 offers a versatile set of statistics and data-mining tools

support subsequent peak identiﬁcation (Kopka et al., 2005). The
detection of alkanes as retention markers can be automated.

Furthermore, peak identiﬁcation itself is facilitated with a
powerful feature: MeltDB 2.0 offers a new Reference list tool
to save peaks of measured reference substances as Reference in
the MeltDB database. The stored data comprises retention indi-
ces, quantiﬁcation masses and mass spectra of reference com-
pounds. This helps to generate project speciﬁc databases that
complement the Golm Metabolite Database (http://gmd.
mpimp-golm.mpg.de/) (Kopka et al., 2005) or the National
Institute of Standards and Technology standard reference data-
base 1A (http://www.nist.gov/srd/nist1a.cfm). The tool allows to
aggregate References and to use their underlying mass spectra for
efﬁcient peak identiﬁcation and comparison.

2.2 From PD to ID: proﬁling methods

To complete the ﬁrst step towards ID, peaks in different chro-
matograms that derive from the same small molecule have to be
named consistently and need to be associated to each other.
Thus, a new support for GC—MS-based metabolite profiling ex-
periments has been implemented. The focus for the profiling
approach in MeltDB 2.0 is to combine the results from chemo-
metrics approaches with further identiﬁcation.

The generic MeltDB approach can be applied on netCDF,
szML (Pedrioli et al., 2004) and szATA (Orchard et al.,
2007) measurements from any supported analytical system. The
novel tool registers peaks for non-targeted metabolite profiling
based on multiple criteria. These are similarity of mass spectra,
retention time difference and the existence of common extracted-
ion chromatogram (EIC) peaks above a given signal-to-noise
threshold. It allows to annotate completely unknown peaks that
are consistently detectable in several measurements of a metabo-
lomics experiment. Thus, these potentially interesting peaks can
be subjected to further statistical analyses in MeltDB and become
accessible for proﬁling experiments, where the aim is in general to
ﬁnd differences in the metabolic composition of two or more
sample groups.

Parameterizations of all pre-processing tools can be custo-
mized freely from within the web interface. Parameterizations
are persisted project wide so that other users from the same
projectiwho typically use similar instrumental setupsazan
reuse them. As pre-processing methods are usually too long run-
ning tasks as to complete during a web request or to even allow
interactivity, these jobs are forwarded to our compute cluster and
run decoupled from the web server.

As soon as pre-processing is completed at least to the point of
profiling, data tables can be exported as XLS or TSV ﬁles. This
allows to subsequently use the MeltDB 2.0 processing results in
other external programs of choice.

2.3 Analyzing PD: efﬁcient mass decomposition

To elucidate single mass signals in a spectrum, e.g. to identify an
unknown compound or to explain a certain fragmentation, po-
tential sum formulas explaining this signal may be insightful.
Thus, a combination of the efﬁcient mass decomposition algo-
rithm described by Bocker et a]. (2006) with the ﬁlter criteria
described by Kind and Fiehn (2007) has been implemented.

Fig. 2. The improved algorithm was compared with the original mass
decomposition approach. For compounds of molecular mass close to
1000 Da, 7-fold runtime improvements can be observed. As presented
in the graph, the relation of the runtimes of both methods is not linear.
Especially for large compounds, the improved variant becomes most
beneﬁcial

To improve the runtime of the approach and reduce the
number of false positives, the maximal numbers of heteroatoms
in the molecular formulae of metabolites in the mass ranges of
100 Da from 0 to 2000 Da have been extracted from public me-
tabolite databases. These numbers act as upper limits for the
molecular formula generation and drastically reduce the
number of formulae that are evaluated by the algorithm.

To evaluate the runtime improvement of the newly imple-
mented algorithm compared with the filter-free version, 200 com-
pounds from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) compound database with speciﬁed sum formulas and
known molecular masses were chosen in the mass interval from 0
to 1000 Da. For each of these compounds, mass decomposition
was performed using the filter-free and the improved algorithm
with a maximal mass deviation of :l:0.05 Da. Runtime informa-
tion was obtained using a 64 bit 2600 MHz AMD system running
Solaris OS 5.10. Figure 2 shows the runtime in relation to the
molecular mass of the compound. It can be observed that the
filtered version is up to seven times faster, and the improvement
is observable especially for large molecules and masses.

In addition to the runtime improvement, the filtering of the
potential candidate formulae is applied afterwards to remove
infeasible formulae from the generated candidate list. Simple ﬁl-
ters can generally be computed in constant time (Degree of
Unsaturation, Lewis check, Senior check, Heteroatom rule)
(Kind and Fiehn, 2007), but especially the computation of the-
oretical isotope patterns needs at least 0(n*K2) time for each
sum formula with n being the size of the atom alphabet and K
representing the length of the computed distribution (Bocker
et al., 2006). The matching and scoring of the measured and
simulated isotope patterns adds 0(K) runtime. Every infeasible
sum formula that is filtered out implicitly by the improved algo-
rithm does not need to be post processed in the ﬁltering stage,
which furthermore improves the overall runtime of the method.

The improved and extended implementation is offered
through the MeltDB 2.0 web interface, and it can be applied
on every detected chromatographic peak. Users can specify the
expected mass error of the instrument and correct the effect of
potential adduct ions, which is especially important in LC-MS

measurements. Several filters can be activated to reduce the
number of computed sum formulas. As the implementation
does automatically extract and sort, the dominant ions found
in the mass spectrum, the access to the mass decomposition is
greatly simpliﬁed for the researcher.

After the efﬁcient generation and ﬁltering step, the sum for-
mulae are compared with the KEGG compound database.
Matching sum formulae are highlighted, and both compound
name and synonyms are presented to the user.

2.4 From RD to DD: new user interfaces

Visual inspection and the possibility for manual curation is im-
portant at all data abstraction levels, i.e. from RD to DD. Intui-
tive and responsive data Visualizations are required as well as
intelligent tools that allow to solve common tasks, such as the
inspection of processing results or the navigation from an experi-
ments overview to the spectrum of a single peak, in a few steps.
Introducing Asynchronous Javascripting and XML to MeltDB
2.0 using the jQuery library (http://jquery.com) allows a new
quality of interactive and dynamic data display (The user can
interact with Visualizations to cause small changes to the data
representation. These changes are performed in place without
requiring a reload of the Visualization) in terms of speed, respon-
siveness and user guidance. This was utilized to improve the
Experiment Total Ion Current View [cmp. (Fig. 3b)] with peak
speciﬁc tooltips containing information about the associated
compounds, latest annotations, and quantities (Fig. 3b.1). On

demand, the complete peak object can be loaded and displayed
inside the experiment TIC View, giving i.a. access to its spectrum,
the complete list of annotations and observations.

One additional major improvement that beneﬁts from the
employment of Asynchronous Javascripting and XML is the dy-
namic manual annotation dialog [cmp. (Fig. 3c)]. The inter-
active annotation functionality for whole experiments has
been improved so that aligned peaks with high mass spectral
similarity can be annotated in parallel. The streamlined web
interface helps to annotate peaks across chromatograms in a
consistent manner, when researchers annotate manually, correct
errors of automated annotation tools or correct data that have
been imported beforehand. This consistency is ensured by an
autocompletion of compound names according to the KEGG
database and is important for statistical analyses and compari-
son of results among different experiments.

2.5 From ID to DD: extended statistics and data mining

In metabolomics, data analysis and mining can be driven by
various intentions and will strive for DD with different purposes.
One way to group these aims is to relate them to one of the
following questions: (i) What are the significant features of a
sample group separating it from other sample groups? (ii) Do
groups of samples form clusters according to their features
and quantities? (iii) Can a sample be assigned to a class based
on its spectral features? For each of these questions, a variety of
statistical analysis methods exists.

The Annotate tool (screenshot shown) allows to manually deﬁne a description and select a KEGG compound. Similar peaks from other chromatograms
are suggested and can be annotated in a batch. Alternatively, the MeltDB-own Warped Peak Detection can be applied to ﬁnd and quantify peaks, which
are similar to ones that are already annotated in other chromatograms using the tool ReQuantify Peaks for Exisiting Annotations. Sample names in the

A binding to the R software (R Development Core Team,
2011) makes numerous statistical tools available from within
the MeltDB software (Neuweger et al., 2008). Its database ob-
jects are converted to R objects in a standardized manner.
Information about chromatogram associations to chromatogram
groups is pertained in the data representation. This ID conver-
sion avoids the cumbersome process of converting data tables
from proprietary software to a format a statistics software pack-
age can interpret and analyze. By default, data are gathered from
the database on the fly, but snapshots can be stored to speed up
statistical analyses vastly, especially for large experiments.

Statistical analyses and data mining tools in MeltDB are
accessed through a standardized parameterization and data selec-
tion form. Where appropriate, this basic form is extended with
speciﬁc options and parameters. The basic form consists of a list
of all chromatograms of the experiment from which the user may
select. Additionally, features can be selected to be considered
in the analysis. Features can either be identiﬁed compounds or
unidentiﬁed features that have been detected consistently among
most chromatograms. A feature or compound can be chosen as
reference to normalize to. When available, ribitol is preselected.
One can select whether peak intensities or peak areas will be used
for quantitation. Quantitations can be scaled lineary or logarith-
mically. Missing values can be handled in different ways.

To determine the significance and variances of features (see
question a), the t-test of the Perl CPAN package Statistics:
T T est (Juan, 2003) and Statistics::Krthkal Wallis (Lee, 2003) is
offered as well as analysis of variance using the aov method of
the R statistical software (R Development Core Team, 2011),
which fits a linear model. For all of these, Bonferroni, Holm
and Benjamini & Hochberg corrections are calculated
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Holm, 1979). For each feature
(metabolite) presented in the analysis of variance and Kruskali
Wallis test results, a boxplot View and the extracted ion chromato-
grams of all samples can directly be accessed. In another View,
the m-values (log-2 signal ratios) of features of all chromatogram
groups of an experiment in reference to the same features in a
user-selected chromatogram group are displayed tabularly.
Volcano plots can be created plotting either the a-values (average
log-2 signal values) or t-test values (as negative decadic logarithm
of the P—Value) against m-values. Variable importance estimation
Via the random forest algorithm from the caret R package (Kuhn
et al., 201 1) can be applied to find differing features in groups. The
metabolite set enrichment analysis published by Persicke et a].
(2011) is another powerful tool in MeltDB for the identiﬁcation
of differentially regulated metabolic pathways.

Samples may aggregate to clusters according to their features
quantities (see question b), regardless of the groups they nomin-
ally belong to. To Visualize these clusters, MeltDB provides the
dimensionality reduction methods principal component analysis
(PCA, prcomp method in R, cmp. Fig. 4b), independent compo-
nent analysis (ICA, fastICA package for R) and partial least
squares discriminant analysis (caret package for R) (Kuhn
et al., 2011; Marchini et al., 2010; R Development Core Team,
2011). Hierarchical clustering allows to display dendrograms of
chromatograms and is made available using the hclust method in
R, which can be applied with different linkage methods (cmp.
Fig. 4c). The heatmap method of R is used to show false color
maps of feature signals in chromatograms, sorting columns and

rows according to the before-mentioned hierarchical clustering of
feature signals and chromatograms, respectively. Here, data can
be normalized for either chromatograms or features.

Whenever a dataset is subdivided in k groups (see question c),
as samples were for instance taken from k sites or treated with k
different protocols, another suitable data mining strategy is to
apply supervised machine-leaming methods to learn to approxi-
mate a relationship between metabolic profiles to the k categories
(Hastie et al., 2009). Such a classiﬁcation can be helpful in the
design of automated screening and identiﬁcation processes or
give insight into hidden links in small molecule patterns, which
are characteristic for a group k’. This propelled to extend
MeltDB with the powerful R package caret (Kuhn et al., 2011)
of which the variable importance estimation has been aforemen-
tioned. Now, classiﬁcation algorithms (support vector machine,
random forest) can be trained with chromatogram groups repre-
senting c different classes {(00, ..,a)c,1} and then be applied to
other chromatograms of samples that have not yet been assigned
to any class a),-. For evaluation purposes, the user may opt to
partition chromatograms into training and testing groups ran-
domly. Additionally, MeltDB uses caret to compute and evaluate
the classiﬁcation performances of the algorithms random forest,
k nearest neighbors, support vector machine, neural networks
and partial least squares, to estimate which classiﬁcation algo-
rithm performs best on a problem.

Generally, the computed results can be downloaded as TSV,
XLS, PNG or PDF ﬁles in addition to the representation in the
web browser.

2.6 Diving into DD: new interactive visualizations

To ultimately grasp the gist of gathered and calculated DD
information, Visualizations will be powerful tools, if they are
intuitive, fast, responsive, easily customizable andimost import-
antiwell represent the underlying data.

The R software is not only useful for statistical analysis com-
putation but also for the results Visualization. Parameterization of
the analyzes and customization of the Visualizations is realized
with MeltDBs tool forms, which can be easily extended on request
or requirement. Nevertheless, these Visualizations are static, and
even small changes require server side computing and a page
reload. This makes Visual data exploration a time-consuming pro-
cess. Therefore, new Visualizations have been developed for
MeltDB 2.0, which are based on the R data output and thus are
consistent with their static ‘sister’ Visualizations, but prepare the
results in a novel dynamic and interactive fashion.

There are several web technologies for the development of
rich internet applications (RIAs) available. Oracle®’s JavaTM
Webstart applications, using the Java Network Launch
Protocol, belong to the ﬁrst RIAs created for the web (Farrell
and Nezlek, 2007). The Adobe® Flash® technology and the
Flash® Builder® made platform-independent RIA development
even easier and provided great functionality for user interface
design, backed by a large Vivid community. Most recent changes
in the industry, namely, the development of HTML 5, made
Javascript-based RIA development applicable and seem to
shorten the unique qualities of Flash. In the development of inter-
active content for MeltDB, these concepts have been followed.

A Java Webstart application is introduced, displaying the ﬁrst
three components of PCA and ICA results in a rotatable 3D

grid. Samples are color encoded according to their chromato-
gram groups and metabolites contributing to the three compo-
nents are represented in a bi-plot in the same grid. The 3D Viewer
is accessible through the web interface and allows to effectively
explore dimensionality reduction results of hundreds of samples.

Basic Visualizations such as scatter plots and bar charts are
now realized as Javascript-based interactive Views that allow to
ﬁlter, zoom and demand additional details, following the infor-
mation Visualization mantra of Shneiderman and Plaisant (2004).
For that, the Javascript libraries jQuery(http://jquery.com) and
Highcharts (http://highcharts.com) were used. An interactive
table of quantities was realized based on the AdobeTM
FlashTM platform. Metabolite signal intensities or areas are pro-
jected to a color scale and displayed for each chromatogram or
as the mean of a chromatogram group. The FlashTM application
is available through the MeltDB web interface and receives the
data table as an XML document provided by the MeltDB API.
Parameterization that is necessary for the compilation of the data
table can be assigned Via the standard MeltDB tool form.

To compare raw 2D chromatograms Visually, a new tool
called ColorizeMS was created. Users can chose three chromato-
grams to assign each to one channel red, green or blue of an
overlay image. Although common signals will appear in white,
signals that are missing in one or two chromatograms can easily
be spotted due to their coloration.

3 APPLICATION EXAMPLE AND RESULTS

This application example makes use of a dataset from another
study (in preparation) in which we investigated whether it is
possible to distinguish between wheat samples of different
years, farming schemes and cultivars. The data shown in the
following result from the GC-MS measurements of a wheat cul-
tivar that was grown in the years 2007 and 2010 and under
organic (O) and conventional (C) treatment. Consequently, sam-
ples can be divided into the four groups 2007-0, 2007-C, 2010-0
and 2010-C. Each group consists of four biological replicates,
which were each analyzed as two technical replicates. This results
in a total of eight chromatograms per group. Chromatograms of
low quality have been discarded.

The MeltDB 2.0 processing pipelines and its versatile tool box
for statistical analyses was applied to reveal potential differences
in the metabolic compositions of wheat from two distinct years
and treatments. These insights may lead to the determination of
bio markers that allow to distinguish between the respective
sample groups. However, the focus of this application example
is on the software and its capabilities, not on the biological in-
terpretation of the generated results.

The MeltDB setup started by uploading the chromatograms
(RD) in the netCDF file format. These were then organized into
an experiment of four chromatogram groups. Peak detection was
performed using the MeltDB Warped Peak Detection method.
Alkanes were detected by the RISimple method, and peaks were
thus provided with interpolated retention indices, completing the
steps toward PD. Subsequently, Multiple Proﬁling was per-
formed to consistently name peaks with similar spectra and re-
tention indices throughout chromatograms of the experiment.
Finally, to obtain ID, peaks were matched against the

user-curated Reference List database to annotate identiﬁed peaks
with the respective compound names.

The tool Show Absent/Present Compounds reveals a tabular
presentation of pie charts, which shows in how many chromato-
grams of a particular chromatogram group or the entire experi-
ment a particular compound was identiﬁed (cmp. Fig. 3a).
Compounds that were identiﬁed automatically in the majority
of chromatograms are likely to be found by manual inspection in
the remaining measurements. This is easy owing to the mean
retention time that is provided for each compound to ﬁnd the
respective peaks in the Experiment Total Ion Chromatogram View
(cmp. Fig. 3b). Here, peaks with the same annotation and de-
scription are Visually connected by Iink-and—brush (Highlighting
an annotated peak will cause all other peaks with the same an-
notation and description to highlight too. This Visually links sig-
nals that derive from the same original molecule throughout
measurements). Peaks that were not annotated automatically
(or annotated incorrectly) are easily spotted and may be anno-
tated semi-automatically now. This is possible using the Annotate
tool that is offered for each peak and allows to fill an annotation
form manually, but it also allows to select peaks with similar
spectra and similar retention time from other chromatograms
to be annotated in the same way (cmp. Fig. 3c). Another tool,
ReQuantify Peaks for Existing Annotations, provides means to
locally run the Warped Peak Detection with relaxed thresholds
and using existing annotations of a certain compound as samples
to be matched. Using these tools, even large experiments of
several hundred chromatograms can be annotated with high
coverage in a reasonable time frame.

In the following, tools for Visualization and statistical analysis
are demonstrated that ﬁnally help to gather DD. In MeltDB 2.0,
these tools may generally be adjusted with an upstream form for
selection of chromatograms and compounds to be used.
Furthermore, the user can set the specific parameters of each
tool as well as the common settings, such as how to deal with
missing zeros in the data, whether to use peak intensities or peak
areas or whether to scale them logarithmically.

To get a first overview of the measured compound abundances
among chromatograms of the experiment, the Heatmap Visual-
ization is a helpful choice (cmp. Fig. 4a). For a quick insight or
Visual control, all chromatograms and all compounds should
be selected. Abundances are taken from peak areas, without
additional scaling. In this case, missing values were replaced
with zeros to make them easily spottable in the heatmap, as
zero values are displayed as black boxes. The Heatmap tabularly
represents all compound abundances in all chromatograms or
their mean abundances in chromatogram groups according to
a blue-to-red (low to high abundance) color scale. Rows (com-
pounds) and columns (chromatograms or chromatogram
groups) can be rearranged freely. Rows may additionally be
sorted alphabetically, by mean abundance or by coefﬁcient of
variance. The color scale is either normalized on the whole ex-
periment or on each single compound. The color scale may be
shifted by a factor using a slider. The Heatmap as currently set
can be exported as a PNG file.

When analyzing data of multipleiand as in this case even
overlapping classesiit is generally interesting whether and
which clusters are formed. Typical workhorses to explore this
are Principal Component Analysis (pca) and Hierarchical

Cluster Analysis (hca). Figure 4b shows a screenshot of the inter-
active scatter plot of the pca, which was calculated on all chro-
matograms, and all compounds that were detected in all
chromatograms (option ‘strict’ for missing values). Measured
peak areas were taken for quantiﬁcation. Data points with the
same color belong to the same chromatogram group. As the pca
shows, samples are clearly separated by years along the ﬁrst
principal component (x-axis), which explains 75.24% of the vari-
ance in the data. Less clear but still Visible is a separation ac-
cording to the cultivation type, mainly oriented along the second
principal component (y-axis), which explains 6.28% of the data.
A mouse over on a data point reveals its chromatogram name
and coordinates in the plot (cmp. Fig. 4b.1). Similarly, the hca as
shown in Figure 4c mainly clusters data according to their years,
whereas samples of the same cultivation type group cluster
hardly at all. The hca was performed as a Ward clustering
with the same basic settings as the pca.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

MeltDB 2.0 was developed to comprehensively provide means to
complete the entire process from RD to DD within a software
platform that supports researchers of diverse scientiﬁc back-
grounds and fosters collaborations in complex metabolomics re-
search projects. It was a further goal to make the final
exploration of produced results and statistical outcomes effective
and efﬁcient. This has been achieved by improving the MeltDB
tool set throughout all four stages RD, PD, ID and DD. These
recent developments leveraged MeltDB to an interactive RIA
that allows to generate high-quality datasets and to dive deep
into their analyses.

As MeltDB was first published in 2008, a few other tools have
been released that take a similar line. The MetaboAnalyst (2.0)
web server offers a feature set similar to MeltDB, also supplying
means to cover the pipeline from RD to DD. MetaboAnalyst is
merely made for a one-time web service-like usage though,
whereas MeltDB offers a project and user management that sup-
ports collaborative work, allows to manually reﬁne and annotate
processing results and stores data for documentation purposes
and to support larger and/or long-term projects.

The MetabolomeExpress web server is dedicated to making
reviewed datasets publicly available. For that, it offers a ﬁxed pipe-
line and a set of statistical tools that comprises a clearly smaller set
of features, compared with MeltDB or MetaboAnalyst.

The hierarchical data model of MeltDB 2.0 serves single-
factorial experiment designs best. It is still possible to address
even complex multi-factorial designs, but then a careful organ-
ization (sometimes multiple organizations) of chromatogram
groups is necessary. The application example shown is a multi-
factorial experiment differentiating wheat samples of different
years and farming schemes. It is part of a study that additionally
considers different cultivars as a third factor, which was also
investigated in MeltDB 2.0.

Despite the advantages and opportunities of web platforms,
this technology also has its drawbacks. The most critical aspect
probably is the lack of tools, which lets users browse the original
RD and its raw signals in a smooth interactive way as known
from desktop applications. This can be of particular importance
especially for de novo identiﬁcation of molecules. Thus,

MeltDB 2.0

 

metabolomics web platforms, including MeltDB 2.0, are mostly
useful for experiments with large numbers of chromatograms,
which ask for the statistical comparison of sample groups.

Web platforms are also still limited in the consequent analysis
of LC-MS data. Here, spectral deconvolution is of critical
importance to reveal the interrelationships of mass signals,
which may lead to the identiﬁcation of the original molecules.
Although software like the R tool CAMERA (Kuhl et al., 2012)
exists to address this, it has not yet been integrated into a larger
metabolomics software platform. We are currently working to
overcome that limitation.

Further developments also must include support for multi-
stage (MS”) data, another inevitable tool for proper de novo
identification.

From a more global and systemic point of View into the future,
the potential of integrated analysis with other omics data needs
to be explored more intensively. As an example, the MeltDB 2.0
API allows the ProMeTra (Neuweger et al., 2009) software to
map relative metabolite abundances to pathway maps, together
with either proteome or transcriptome data. Nevertheless, to our
knowledge, there is no software available for truly statistical
multiomics approaches.

In total, MeltDB has undergone substantial improvements in
its capacity as a ‘one-stop-shop’ providing a wide spectrum of
necessary tools to answer biological and statistical questions,
beginning from chromatographics RD files. The addition of
supervised machine-learning tools now allows to directly apply
gathered knowledge for classiﬁcation purposes. Embedded in its
powerful permission management system, MeltDB 2.0 delivers a
powerful bioinformatics package for detailed systemic metabo-
lomics research projects.

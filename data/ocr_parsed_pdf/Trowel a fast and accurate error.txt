3 RESULTS

We performed our evaluations on paired—end Arabidopsis thali—
ana reads (86x) generated in—house and on Illumina datasets
referenced in (Yang et al., 2012) for Escherichia coli (1637
618 X), Staphylococcus aureus (691x), Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(319x) and Drosophila melanogaster (C26x) (Supplementary
Table Sl). We assessed runtime and accuracy in several applica—
tions, and summarized all local ranks of each metric in a sum—of—
rank table (Table 1). Trowel was scored consistently as one of the
top two tools and was among the two most accurate tools for
high—coverage datasets (Supplementary Section 84.1). Trowel has
a better performance than the other tools with genome assem—
blies on high—coverage datasets, while on low—coverage datasets,
the alignment—based tool Coral outperformed all other
k—mer7based methods including Trowel. When the coverage is
highly variable, i.e. for transcriptomes, the dataset is particularly
hard to correct because low—coverage sequences cannot be equa—
ted with higher likelihood of errors. In transcriptome mapping
evaluation for a human dataset (Yang et al., 2011), SEECER (Le
at al., 2013) achieved the best performance (Supplementary
Section 82.3). Aside from this specialized tool, Trowel obtained
the best read accuracy, but was slightly worse in base accuracy
than Coral. Only Trowel improved transcriptome quantiﬁcation;
for the other tools including SEECER, the performance was
worse than the uncorrected cases. For SNP calling evaluations,
Trowel showed the highest concordance with high—coverage
datasets in three of four cases (Supplementary Section 824).
Finally, Trowel was the only tool that consistently generated
expected results with simulated datasets for an erroneous—base—
next—to—repeats problem (Supplementary Section 82.5).
Concerning runtime, Trowel outperformed all other tools for
all datasets, being up to 100 times faster (Table 2). Detailed re—
sults are provided in Supplementary Data.

4 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

We have developed a new error correction module for Illumina
short reads, Trowel, which draws its power to correct bases solely

from high—base qualities rather than coverage estimates. High—
base qualities are a requirement for datasets in practice, whereas
equally distributed coverage cannot always be expected depend—
ing on sequencing performance or quantitative datasets, e. g.
transcriptome studies. We assessed different error correction
tools on numerous commonly used applications for read map—
ping, resequencing, genome assembly and gene expression ana—
lyses. Trowel consistently obtained best or second—best accuracy
on all applications, while achieving on average 25 times faster
runtimes than the other tools. Only on genome assemblies from
low—coverage datasets (£10x), an alignment—based method was
superior. In practice, the low—coverage problem is inevitable, and
further improvements for k—mer7based methods are possible.

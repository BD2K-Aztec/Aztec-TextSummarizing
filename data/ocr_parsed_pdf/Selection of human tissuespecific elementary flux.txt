solutions do arise in our subset of EFMs, which should allow us
to describe more accurately the repertoire of metabolic states.

In light of our subset of EFMs, we analyzed data from Shlomi
et a]. (2008). In that work, based on gene expression data, reac—
tions from Duarte et a]. (2007) are classiﬁed into highly, moder—
ately and lowly expressed in different healthy human tissues. We
used this reaction classiﬁcation to determine characteristic EFMs
for each tissue based on statistical enrichment analysis.

Three—level discrete classiﬁcation of reactions prevented us
from using more established enrichment techniques, such as
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al.,
2005). Instead, we introduced a multivariate hypergeometric
test, which considers highly expressed and lowly expressed reac—
tions in the same statistical score. With this test, we aim to obtain
as characteristic those EFMs enclosing an elevated number of
highly expressed reactions and as few as possible of lowly ex—
pressed reactions. This fact differs from the approach presented
in Schwartz et a]. (2007), which uses the standard hypergeometric
test with only one feature (either highly or lowly expressed reac—
tions). We show in different tissues that this improvement pro—
vides a more accurate picture of their characteristic EFMs and,
therefore, their key metabolic pathways.

2 METHODS

In this section, we ﬁrst introduce the (K,d)-shortest EFM algorithm and
describe its theoretical advance with respect to the one presented in de
Figueiredo et al. (2009a). Then, we detail our statistical framework to
determine characteristic EFMs based on gene expression data.

2.1 (K,d)—shortest EFMs

Consider a metabolic network that comprises R reactions and C metab-
olites. The set of reactions is typically classiﬁed into reversible and irre-
versible reactions. Reversible reactions are here divided into two
irreversible steps that represent forward and backward reactions. We
deﬁne the set B=[(oc, ﬁ)| reaction 0c and reaction )3 are the reverse of
each other, oc<ﬁ]. For each reaction r (r: l,...,R), we deﬁne a ﬂux
variable v, and a binary variable 2,, where 2,21 if v,.>0; 0 otherwise.
The set of metabolites is divided into two subsets, namely external (Ext)
and internal (Int) metabolites. For internal metabolites, it is assumed that
no accumulation or depletion is possible; therefore, the steady state con-
dition holds. We denote s“. the stoichiometric coefﬁcient associated with
metabolite c (c: l, . . . ,C) in reaction r (r = l, . . . ,R). External metabolites
are typically considered as sources/sinks and (sometimes) as cofactors.

The (K,d)-shortest EFM approach is formulated below via mixed-in-
teger linear programming (MILP). In essence, our method computes the
K EFMs that (i) involve a certain reaction j and (ii) differ in at least d
reactions. K, d and j are user-deﬁned. The main difference with respect to
our previous work (de Figueiredo et al., 2009a) is in the use of d, which
before was implicitly set to 1. We here allow d>l to generate a more
diverse set of EFMs. Variables, constraints and objective function are
summarized and described below.

EFMs are steady state flux modes that satisfy a simplicity condition
(Schuster et al., 2000). This simplicity condition was termed the non-
decomposability condition and essentially ensures that ﬂux modes
cannot be further reduced, i.e. they are the simplest possible. As intro-
duced in de Figueiredo et al. (2009a), minimizing the number of active
reactions in the solution (as we are doing here) guarantees that the non-
decomposability condition is satisﬁed.

Equation (1) enforces steady state condition for internal metabolites.
Equation (2) links reaction variables, namely if z,.=l then v,.>0 and if
2,20 then v,.=0; similarly if v,.>0 then 2,21 and if v,: 0 then 2,20.
M is a large positive scalar that provides an upper bound for reaction
ﬂuxes. Equation (3) prevents forward and backward reactions from ap-
pearing together in the solution. Equation (4) forces reaction j to appear
in the solution. As Equation (5) constitutes the main novelty of the (K,d)-
shortest EFMs procedure, we explain below the meaning of this con-
straint in detail (see de Figueiredo et al., 2009a; Rezola et al., 2011).

Let Z’; be the binary solution associated with the k-shortest EFM
(k: 1,. . . , K—l), where Z’; :1 if reaction r is active in the k-shortest
EFM, 0 otherwise. The left side of Equation (5) determines the number of
reactions in the new solution (2,.) that were active in the k-shortest EFM
(k = l, . . . , K—l), and the right side is the number of reactions that were
active in the k-shortest EFM (k = 1,. . . , K—l) less d. The inequality states
that the number of reactions repeating from the k-shortest EFM
(k: 1,. . . , K—l) in the new solution should be smaller than the total
number of active reactions in the k-shortest EFM (k:l,..., K—l)
minus d. If d = l, as in de Figueiredo et al. (2009a), Equation (5) ensures
that, once we solve our model, the k-shortest EFM (k: 1,. . . ,K—l) is
prevented from appearing again in the new solution. If we ﬁx d > 1, our
solution elimination constraints are more restrictive and prevent more
solutions aside from the k-shortest EFM (k: 1,. . . ,K—l) from
appearing.

In summary, if d = l, we compute the K-shortest EFMs. However, if
d> l, we start from the shortest but we will also reach long EFMs. This
feature provides more diversity to computed EFMs, which is precisely the
objective with this approach. Finally, various software tools are available
to perform this task. We used IBM ILOG CPLEX®.

2.2 EFMs enrichment analysis

Assume that, based on gene expression data, reactions are grouped into
three sets: highly, moderately and lowly expressed. We denote RH, RM
and RL the total number of highly, moderately and lowly expressed re-
actions in the network, respectively, and R6 the number of reactions
whose reaction expression is known, namely RG =RH+ RM+ RL.

As noted above, EFMs are the simplest (steady state) ﬂux modes. In
other words, an EFM deﬁnes a subset of reactions whose ﬂux is propor-
tional with respect to a scalar quantity. Based on the above, we denote
He, Me and L, the total number of highly, moderately and lowly ex-
pressed reactions in an EFM e (e: l,...,E), respectively, and Te the
total number of active reactions with known discrete expression status
in an EFM 8, namely TE=HE+ME+LE.

2.2.1 Multivariate hypergeometric testing Given a set of E EFMs,
we aim at ﬁnding a characteristic subset of EFMs for a given cell/tissue in
certain (physiological) conditions, which are assumed to be represented
by measured gene expression data. Clearly, such characteristic EFMs

 

2010

Selection of human tissue-specific elementary flux modes using gene expression data

 

should involve an elevated number of highly expressed reactions (He) and
as few as possible lowly expressed reactions (L). To consider an EFM as
characteristic, its associated gene expression data must be statistically
signiﬁcant. For this purpose, we need to ensure that the pair (He, L.)
in an EFM e of Te reactions with known expression status can hardly
arise by chance in the context of the whole network, which is deﬁned by
the tern (RH, RM, RL), and therefore it is dependent on gene expression
data. For this purpose, we pose the following hypothesis test:

Hg: EFM e is not characteristic, and therefore it is independent of gene
expression data.
H ,: EFM e is characteristic, and therefore it is dependent on gene
expression data.

Obtaining EFMs of length Te with i highly and j lowly expressed re-
actions by chance is represented here as a random extraction of Te balls
without replacement in an urn. The probability mass function of a multi-
variate random variable describing the number of highly and lowly ex-
pressed reactions in an EFM (random extraction), X: (i,j), follows a
multivariate hypergeometric distribution with parameters Rg, RH, R L and
Te, as introduced in Equation (6).

T.)

To decide whether (or not) the null hypothesis is rejected for a given
EFM e of length Te with He highly and Le lowly expressed reactions, we
determined the P-value (pg) as the probability of obtaining the same or a
better expression status by chance [Equation (7)]. Note here that an
equal/better outcome than the pair (He, Le) satisfies two conditions:
(i) the number of lowly expressed reactions is less or equal than Le;
and (ii) the number of highly expressed reactions is greater or equal
than He, whereas keeping unchanged the length of the EFM (Te).
These conditions require the use of one side hypothesis test.

(1’ +1 5 Te)

This rule excludes solutions with fewer highly expressed reactions. In
addition, it seems functionally appropriate to establish that a worse so-
lution involves more lowly expressed reactions, even with more highly
expressed reactions.

Note here that P-values were computed using the ‘BiasedUrn ’ package
in R. In this package, dMFNCHypergeo function returns the probability
mass function for the multivariate Fisher’s hypergeometric distribution
shown in Equation (6).

2.2.2 Multiple hypothesis testing In single hypothesis testing, a result
is called signiﬁcant if the associated P-value is smaller than a signiﬁcance
level 0c (often 0c 2 0.05 in the scientiﬁc literature). This determines the type I
error rate, i.e. the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is
actually true. Extending this concept when several hypotheses are tested
simultaneously (as done here) is studied in the ﬁeld of multiple hypothesis
testing. In this situation, the deﬁnition of an error measure according to the
rate of false positives is more complex and refers to the probability of
rejecting a null hypothesis when all (or ﬁg) null hypotheses are actually
true. For this purpose, we used the false discovery rate (FDR) approach
presented in Storey and Tibshirani (2003), which maximizes the statistical
power and maintains the conservative estimation of false positives:

fro-m-t

m0) = W

(8)

where m is the total number of hypotheses tested, R(t) is the number of
P-values below t (te[0,l]) and fro is the estimated rate of truly null
hypothesis. This FDR approach assigns a q-value qe to each hypothesis
(similar to the P-value). The q-value is the FDR measure of signiﬁcance
and deﬁnes the minimum FDR that can be attained when calling a
P-value (pg) signiﬁcant, as observed in Equation (9).

516076) = Iggy m0) (9)

A more accurate estimation of ﬁg constitutes the main gain in statis-
tical power with respect to control FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg,
1995), which assumes ﬁg 2 l by considering all hypotheses as truly null.
Note here that we are posing one-sided test statistics, as reﬂected in our
deﬁnition of P-value in Equation (7). For this scenario, a robust and
conservative estimation of ﬁg is provided in Pounds and Cheng (2006),
as shown below.

ﬁg 2 min(l, 2a)
m
a =$l§12min(p.,1—pe) (10)
A fundamental assumption in the method described above is that the
joint distribution of the true null P-values must follow a uniform distri-
bution on (0,1), Uniform (0,1) (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003). This prop-
erty does not hold in our case, due to underlying discreteness in input
data and dependencies among EFMs. When uniformity property in the
joint distribution of true null P-values is violated, observed P-values must
be (somehow) corrected to satisfy this property (Forner et al., 2008). For
this purpose, we ﬁrst empirically veriﬁed this issue using bootstrapping,
namely by calculating the P-value of each EFM in N different random
permutations of the set of highly expressed reactions (RH) and lowly
expressed reactions (RL), while maintaining RG unchanged. We ﬁxed
N: 50, as empirical experience shows that the null joint distribution be-
haves similarly for larger values of N. Then, we transformed empirical
null P-values ([7?) into a Uniform (0,1), according to Equation (11).

Then, after checking that pf‘m’w follows a Uniform (0,1), the same trans-
formation is done to observed P-values (pg), as in Equation (12).

This procedure guarantees that the null distribution of transformed

P-values (17:19“) follows a Uniform (0,1), and therefore the mentioned
FDR approach can be applied.

3 RESULTS

The (K,d)—shortest EFM algorithm is applied here to determine a
subset of EFMs in human metabolism aiming at capturing a
diverse and representative set of pathways. We integrated this
subset of EFMs with expression data of 10 human tissues (liver,
brain, heart, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate, spleen, thymus and
skeletal muscle) and determined their characteristic EFMs.
Finally, the technical performance of our approach is analyzed
and a biological discussion focused on liver is accomplished.

3.1 EFMs in human metabolic network

The human metabolic network presented in Duarte et al. (2007)
comprises 2766 metabolites and 3742 reactions. Reversible reac—
tions are split into two different reactions. Overall, we have 4892

non—negative ﬂuxes. We assumed a general growth medium, as
deﬁned in Duarte et al. (2007). As our main objective is to ﬁnd
key biosynthetic and degradation routes for different nutrients,
we neglected the balancing of highly present cofactors (see
Supplementary Material S1), and therefore they were considered
external metabolites. This is a common practice in pathway ana—
lysis that substantially simpliﬁes the interpretation of EFMs and
reduces computation time (de Figueiredo et al., 2009a; Rezola
et al., 2011).

To obtain a diverse set of metabolic pathways from the human
metabolic network, we used the (K,d)—shortest EFM procedure,
as described in Methods section. To illustrate its performance,
we computed five EFMs with (l : l and (l : 5, forcing the citrate
synthase reaction to be involved in all EFMs (Fig. 1).

It can be observed that the (K,d)—shortest procedure obtains
more varied EFMs than the standard K—shortest method, invol—
ving a higher number of reactions. Importantly, the (K,d)—short—
est approach captures the tricarboxylic acid cycle among its first
ﬁve solutions, whereas the K—shortest EFM method does not,
which reﬂects a clear advantage. To ﬁx an appropriate d—value,
a sensitivity analysis can be found in Supplementary Material S2.
Based on this analysis and empirical evidence, (I: 5 guarantees
diversity in the computed set of EFMs.

We applied the (K,d)—shortest EFM method with K: d : 5 for
each reaction in Duarte et al. (2007). Therefore, we computed
ﬁve EFMs per reaction, which would comprise a list of 24 460
EFMs. However, because of inconsistent reactions, infeasibilities
and repeats, we obtained a ﬁnal list of 5876 distinct EFMs from
the human metabolic network. Details of EFMs can be found in
Supplementary Material Sl. For this task, we used two PCs with
2.00GHz CPU and 12 GB of RAM during approximately 1
week. We observed that the lengths of the resulting EFMs are
distributed between 2 and 52 reactions, which supports that our
approach leads to both short and long EFMs.

To validate that our search procedure captures a diverse set of
human metabolic pathways, we counted the number of
HumanCyc pathways appearing in our subset of EFMs.
HumanCyc is a well—known bioinformatics database that pro—
vides a repository of human metabolic pathways (Trupp et al.,
2010). At the time when our analysis was conducted, HumanCyc
included 282 biosynthesis, degradation and energy metabolism
pathways. Some of these pathways involve reactions either not
found or inconsistent (not able to carry ﬂux) in Duarte et al.
(2007). After ﬁltering these unpredictable pathways, we obtained
l80 feasible metabolic pathways. Our set of EFMs fully re—
covered l42 HumanCyc pathways. In particular, 2484 of our
5876 EFMs contained at least one entire HumanCyc pathway.
This indicates that half of our EFMs (>50%) do not completely
contain a known metabolic pathway and novel pathways may
arise. In light of these results, we can conclude that our set of
EFMs captures a high variety of metabolic pathways in human
cells, and therefore it can be used similarly to a functional data—
base where experimental information (such as ‘omics’ data) is
integrated. This is precisely what we do in the next subsection.

3.2 Characteristic EFMs in human tissues

Given the set of EFMs determined in the previous subsection, we
aim at selecting a characteristic subset of them for each of the 10

healthy human tissues analyzed. For this purpose, we used the
reaction classiﬁcation accomplished in Shlomi et al. (2008) based
on gene expression data. In that work, a gene is considered
highly (or lowly) expressed in a certain healthy tissue if it is
substantially uniformly expressed (or non—expressed) in all
GeneNote entries (Shmueli et al., 2003) and in HPRD (Mishra
et al., 2006), otherwise it is considered moderately expressed.
Based on this classiﬁcation of genes and their Boolean rules
for enzymes (Duarte et al., 2007), reactions are similarly classi—
fied into highly, moderately and lowly expressed in each tissue
and then they are mapped into our set of EFMs. Details of this
mapping for each EFM in each different tissue, which deﬁnes a
particular subset of highly, moderately and lowly expressed re—
actions, can be found in Supplementary Material Sl. We then
determined the P—value (pg) for each EFM based on multivariate
hypergeometric distribution, as described in Methods section.
The complete set of P—values for our set of human EFMs in
each different tissue can be found in Supplementary Material Sl.

In particular, the use of a multivariate hypergeometric distri—
bution allows us to consider highly and lowly expressed reactions
in a unique statistical score, and therefore our analysis is not
limited to a single feature, as found in others approaches. In
particular, in Schwartz et al. (2007), the standard hypergeometric
distribution was used to determine the statistical significance of
EFMs via BlastSets (Barriot et al., 2004). In that work, lowly and
moderately expressed reactions are grouped, and therefore the
enrichment of only highly expressed reactions in EFMs is eval—
uated. This, however, may lead to incorrect conclusions from the
functional point of view, e.g. an EFM e with expression status
(Hg : 5, Me : 0, Le : 5) would be a better outcome than (Hg : 4,
Me: 6, Le:0), which is counterintuitive. Our multivariate
hypergeometric approach directly deals with this issue and
allows us to treat differently lowly and moderately expressed
reactions.

For illustration, Figures 2A and 2B show the number of lowly,
moderately and highly expressed reactions in the top 100 EFMs
in skeletal muscle tissue using the standard and multivariate
hypergeometric distribution, respectively. The effect of the multi—
variate hypergeometric approach is visually observed in Figure 2,
as the number of lowly expressed reactions (length of light grey
bars) in the best ranked EFMs is substantially reduced, whereas
the number of highly expressed reactions remains similar. This
result shows that our approach provides a more biologically
meaningful subset of signiﬁcant EFMs with respect to the stand—
ard hypergeometric distribution.

Because we are testing several hypotheses simultaneously,
P—values must be corrected. We applied the FDR approach pre—
sented in Storey and Tibshirani (2003), which determines a
q—value ((16) for each EFM. As noted in Methods section, before
q—values calculation, P—values were transformed to satisfy that
distribution of true null hypotheses is uniform, as assumed in
FDR approach. As in other works (Gennarino et al., 2012;
Menashe et al., 2012), we fixed an FDR of 20% for each
tissue, i.e. we extracted a subset of characteristic EFMs whose
FDR is <20°/o ((16 E 0.2). This implies that <20% of these EFMs
may have appeared by chance, and therefore they are not really
tissue speciﬁc. The list of q—values for each EFM in the different
tissues can be found in Supplementary Material Sl.

EFMs in skeletal muscle were also present in heart tissue, while
not the contrary. The same was found between muscle and brain.
Two clusters with a similar set of characteristic EFMs were
observed: (i) pancreas and kidney; (ii) thymus, spleen and pros—
tate. Liver highly differs from the rest of tissues. Finally, we also
determined tissue—speciﬁc metabolites, i.e. metabolites active in
only one of the tissues, based on their resulting characteristic
EFMs. It was found that 7 of 10 tissues do have a signiﬁcant
number of speciﬁc metabolites (see Supplementary Material S3),
some of which are known to have a role in those tissues. For
example, phosphatidylinositol—3,4—bisphosphate is a secondary
messenger in neurons (T anaka et al., 1999), whereas 1D—myo—
inositol 1,4—bisphosphate is a degradation product of a Ca2+
channel regulator (c.f. Trinquet et al., 2006).

3.3 Characteristic EFMs in liver

A detailed analysis of the characteristic EFMs and metabolites in
liver showed that the main key functionalities of this organ were
captured. The majority of the EFMs take part in steroid metab—
olism (178 EFMs), fatty acid B—oxidation (75 EFMs), one—carbon
metabolism (27 EFMs) and urea cycle (15 EFMs). For a more
detailed classiﬁcation of them, see Supplementary Material S1.

Approximately two thirds of the EFMs associated with the
steroid metabolism are involved in bile acid synthesis, which is
one of the main functions of hepatocytes (Monte, 2009; Gille
et al., 2010). Given that our subset of EFMs mainly includes
short EFMs, the precursor found for the synthesis of bile acids
is vitamin D3 instead of cholesterol (Monte, 2009) or fatty acid
(Gille et al., 2010). However, these EFMs can be combined with
the EFMs that produce vitamin D3 from acetate, which is ob—
tained in fatty acid ﬂ—oxidation, and reach a similar solution
found by Gille et al. (2010), for the synthesis of bile acids. The
other one—third of the EFMs associated with steroid metabolism
carry out the synthesis of cholesterol, 7—oc,24(S)—dihydroxycholes—
terol, 7—oc,27—dihydroxycholesterol of the prohormone vitamin
D3 and its derivate 25—hydroxyvitamin D3.

The EFMs associated with the urea cycle carry out the deg—
radation of various amino acids: glutamine, alanine, ornithine

and asparagine. On the other hand, the EFMs associated with
the one—carbon metabolism are mainly involved in the catabol—
ism of histidine to glutamate or glutamine. However, some of
these EFMs also capture the conversion of glutamate to 4—ami—
nobutanoate, though this mainly occurs in the brain (Jakobs
et al., 1993). Finally, 22 substrate cycles were found among the
characteristic EFMs of liver.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work, a new modeling framework based on EFMs is
introduced to provide a metabolic context to gene expression
data. To this end, we ﬁrst determined a diverse subset of
EFMs in the human genome—scale metabolic network. We are
aware that our subset of EFMs is not complete; however, it
contains a wide number of reported metabolic pathways in
HumanCyc database and previously uncharacterized metabolic
pathways. Therefore, our subset of EFMs constitutes a rich tem—
plate of metabolic pathways available to the scientiﬁc commu—
nity where experimental ‘omics’ data can be mapped for
functional interpretation.

To compute our subset of EFMs, we introduced a generalized
version of the K—shortest EFM approach presented in de
Figueiredo et al. (2009a). Despite the good performance of the
(K,d)—shortest EFMs procedure, our subset of EFMs can be fur—
ther improved in size and quality to obtain a better picture of
human metabolic processes. For this purpose, other algorithms
should be explored in the future (Kaleta et al., 2009b; Chan and
Ji, 2011).

We also determined a characteristic subset of EFMs in differ—
ent tissues based on expression data. To guarantee statistical
significance, we used a multivariate hypergeometric distribution,
which allows us to consider highly expressed and lowly expressed
reactions in a unique statistical score. We demonstrated that this
test leads to more biologically meaningful EFMs than the stand—
ard hypergeometric approach, as illustrated for skeletal muscle.

Our approach distinguishes between highly, moderately and
lowly expressed genes based on absolute levels of microarray
data. Thus, we need to deﬁne two different thresholds: one for
highly and one for lowly expressed genes. In this article, we dir—
ectly took data from Shlomi et al. (2008). However, for different
microarray datasets, threshold choice can be done using recently
introduced approaches that allow a robust estimation as to
whether (or not) a gene is expressed in a particular sample
(McCall et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2010). These techniques open
the application of our approach for a wide number of datasets.

In this article, our approach was applied to extract active char—
acteristic EFMs. However, ﬁnding repressed EFMs can be easily
done by slightly changing the deﬁnition of P—value. In addition,
we can use our approach to obtain differential EFMs between
two conditions based on fold changes. However, several theor—
etical issues arise, e.g. genes consistently highly expressed may
have a small fold change. To overcome this issue, we propose to
combine both approaches and compare (i) characteristic EFMs
for each condition based on absolute expression levels and (ii)
differential EFMs between two conditions based on fold—change
data.

Our work complements effort in the last years to generate
tissue—speciﬁc metabolic networks (Shlomi et al., 2008;

Selection of human tissue-specific elementary flux modes using gene expression data

 

Gille et al., 2010; Jerby et al., 2010). We found strong variations
among tissues, observing a high number of characteristic EFMs
in several tissues (heart, liver, prostate, spleen, thymus, brain and
kidney), whereas a limited number of them in others, particularly
in lung. Based on characteristic EFMs, we captured tissue—spe—
ciﬁc functions and metabolites. Interestingly, with this analysis
we showed that our set of EFMs allows us to more accurately
predict global metabolic properties, mainly because they are
determined from genome—scale networks, which provide a more
holistic view of metabolism than canonical (HumanCyc)
pathways.

To validate our approach, we analyzed the resulting charac—
teristic EFMs in liver. We found that key metabolic roles of liver,
like steroid metabolism and fatty acid ﬂ—oxidation, were correctly
captured. Other characteristic EFMs are associated with path—
ways that have been described in literature, such as the glucur—
onidation of bilirubin (Hauser et al., 1984), the methylation of
phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine (Vance and
Ridgway, 1988), the methylation of NAD+, which plays a role
in hepatocyte growth (Hoshino et al., 1984), or the tyrosine oxi—
dation to acetoacetate (Knox and LeMay—Knox, 1951). This
shows the predictive power of our approach. Other important
characteristic pathways of liver, such as pathways for lipoprotein
metabolism, were not determined because of limitations in the
metabolic network used (Duarte et al., 2007), as recently high—
lighted in Gille et al. (2010).

Finally, our work constitutes an attempt to integrate experi—
mental data into EFMs and elucidate their physiological rele—
vance, an open challenge in systems biology. We believe that
this effort will help to extend the application of EFMs to differ—
ent questions in biotechnology and health, where metabolism
does play an important role.

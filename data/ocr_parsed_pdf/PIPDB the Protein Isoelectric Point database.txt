2.3 Web implementation

PIP—DB has been implemented as a polylingual web—enabled
database system, including source code written in Clojure
LISP, JavaScript, Less CSS, M4sh, Make, Python and sh pro—
gramming languages. Additional documentation is formatted in
LaTeX, HTML and Markdown.

PIP—DB can be searched by keywords such as protein name,
source organism, experimental method, and cellular and/ or tissue
location and by numerical properties such as pI, EC number,
temperature and MW. A search engine and domain—specific lan—
guage has been designed, which enables searching of PIP—DB by
representing compound queries using tree structures in LISP.

Importantly, PIP—DB can also be searched using global se—
quence similarity, as implemented in BLAST (Altschul et al,
1990). As much of the data we archive have a provenance,
which is legacy in nature, often not linked unambiguously to
explicit sequences, we have generally been conservative in our
assignment of corresponding sequence data, with 2822 sequences
of the 5773 entries.

Ease of use was a priority in constructing PIP—DB, with a
particular emphasis on creating an intuitive search engine.
Navigation through the website is facilitated by the tiered display
of information: encompassing titles, then summary, to full entry,
with links to further information.

3 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In line with our previous database generation exercises (Blythe
et a]. 2002; McSparron et a]. 2004; Toseland et al, 2005a,b;
Toseland et al, 2006; Ansari et a]. 2010), we extract and
record data as described in the original report, without making
arbitrary changes to it. As it is not possible for logistic reasons to
retest each pI value, we must trust these values are accurate.
Context in the form of associated experimental data allows
users to draw their own conclusions regarding data veracity.

Researchers from many disciplines can potentially benefit from
PIP—DB: such as virtual gel methodology and theoretical IEF, as
well as functioning as a tool in its own right to facilitate study of
the physical chemistry of proteins. In particular, predictive pI cal—
culation needs benchmarking, as the veracity of pI predictors is
assumed and not yet proven. What explicit comparisons there
have been, and they are few in number, have used small datasets
(Patrickios and Yamasaki, 199 5), datasets of peptides rather than
proteins (Lengqvist et al, 2011) or report poor accuracy
(Henriksson et al, 1995; Patrickios and Yamasaki, 1995). Thus,
the sequence search feature of PIP—DB will provide an alternative
of true utility to extant predictors and a gold—standard bench—
marking resource for such work.

In summary, PIP—DB is a dedicated, manually—curated fully
searchable database presently containing >5500 measured pI
values, and associated data of many types. As new studies
appear, and legacy data are continually polled, additional infor—
mation will be integrated into PIP—DB. Moreover, we will extend
the scope of the PIP—DB to include peptides, nucleotides and
viruses (Subirats et al, 2011).

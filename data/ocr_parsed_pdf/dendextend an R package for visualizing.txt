Abstract

Summary: dendextend is an R package for creating and comparing visually appealing tree dia—
grams. dendextend provides utility functions for manipulating dendrogram objects (their color,
shape and content) as well as several advanced methods for comparing trees to one another (both
statistically and visually). As such, dendextend offers a flexible framework for enhancing R’s rich
ecosystem of packages for performing hierarchical clustering of items.

Availability and implementation: The dendextend R package (including detailed introductory vi—
gnettes) is available underthe GPL—2 Open Source license and is freely available to download from

CRAN at: (http://c ran.r—project.org/package:dendextend)

1 Introduction

Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) is a widely used family of un-
supervised statistical methods for classifying a set of items into some
hierarchy of clusters (groups) according to the similarities among
the items. The R language (R Core Team, 2014)
platform and open source statistical programming environment—

 

a leading, cross-

has many implementations of HCA algorithms (Chipman and
Tibshirani, 2006; Hornik, 2014; Schmidtlein etal., 2010; Witten
and Tibshirani, 2010). The output of these various algorithms is
stored in the hclust object class; while the dendrogram class is
an alternative object class that is often used as the go-to intermediate
representation step for visualizing an HCA output.

In many R packages; a figure output is adjusted by supplying the
plot function with both an object to be plotted and various graphical
parameters to be modified (colors; sizes; etc.). However; different
behavior happens in the (base R) plot dendrogram function; in
which the function is given a dendrogram object that contains
within itself (most of) the graphical parameters to be used when
plotting the tree. Internally; the dendrogram class is represented as a
nested list of lists with attributes for colors; height; etc. (with useful
methods from the stats package). Until now; no comprehensive
framework has been available in R for flexibly controlling the vari-
ous attributes in dendrogram’ s class objects.

The dendextend package aims to fill this gap by providing a sig-
nificant number of new functions for controlling a dendrogram’s
structure and graphical attributes. It also implements methods for
visually and statistically comparing different dendrogram objects.
The package is extensively validated through unit-testing
(Wickham, 2011); offers a C++ speed-up (Eddelbuettel and
Francois, 2011) for some of the core functions through the
delzdextendchp package; and includes three detailed vignettes.

The dendextend package is primarily geared towards HCA. For
phylogeny analysis; the phylo object class (from the ape package) is
recommended (Paradis etal., 2004). A comprehensive comparison of
dendextend, ape, as well as other software for tree analysis; is avail-
able in the supplementary materials.

2 Description

2.1 Updating a dendrogram for visualization

The function set(dend, what, value); in dendextend; accepts a
dendrogram (i.e. dead) as input and returns it after some adjust-
ment. The parameter what is a character indicating the property of
the tree to be adjusted (see Table 1) based on value. The user can re-
peatedly funnel a tree; through different configuration of the set
function; until a desired outcome is reached.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The rapid accumulation of knowledge in the field of
Systems Biology during the past years requires advanced, but
simple-to-use, methods for the visualization of information in a struc-
tured and easily comprehensible manner.

Results: We have developed biographer, a web-based renderer and
editor for reaction networks, which can be integrated as a library into
tools dealing with network-related information. Our software enables
visualizations based on the emerging standard Systems Biology
Graphical Notation. It is able to import networks encoded in various
formats such as SBML, SBGN-ML and jSBGN, a custom lightweight
exchange format. The core package is implemented in HTML5,
CSS and JavaScript and can be used within any kind of web-based
project. It features interactive graph-editing tools and automatic graph
layout algorithms. In addition, we provide a standalone graph editor
and a web server, which contains enhanced features like web services
for the import and export of models and visualizations in different
formats.

Availability: The biographer tool can be used at and downloaded from
the web page http://biographer.biologie.hu-berlin.de/. The different
software packages, including a server-indepenent version as well
as a web server for Windows and Linux based systems, are available
at http://code.google.com/p/biographer/ under the open-source
license LGPL.

1 INTRODUCTION

The web resource Pathguide (Bader et al., 2006) currently lists 35
databases for ‘Pathway Diagrams’ of biochemical reaction net-
works, each using different means of Visualization and contain-
ing at least a two digit number of network graphs. Although
other scientiﬁc areas have used universal Visual languages for
decades, e.g. circuit diagrams in electrical engineering or UML
in software engineering, Systems Biology was missing uniﬁed
network Visualizations until the introduction of the Systems
Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) (Le Novere et al., 2009).
SBGN provides standardized glyphs for the representation of

cellular networks in three different languages: Activity Flow dia-
grams, depicting the ﬁow of information through a network,
Entity Relationship diagrams, showing possible interactions of
network components, and Process Descriptions (PD), highlight-
ing the temporal order of such interactions, all of which are fully
supported by biographer.

Several tools supporting SBGN compliant Visualization
are already available. However, they suffer from limitations.
Desktop applications like CellDesigner (Funahashi et al., 2003),
PathVisio (van Iersel et al., 2008) and SBGN-ED (Czauderna
et al., 2010) require the user to install them in their operating
system, creating a barrier for their initial use. Web-based Visual-
ization tools do not provide ready to use libraries (e. g. Reactome,
J oshi-Tope et al., 2005) and/ or do not adhere to representation
standards (e. g. KEGG, Ogata et al., 1999). Such libraries would
be of great help in the development of novel tools supporting
SBGN-compliant Visualizations. The libSBGN (van Iersel et al.,
2012) enables basic manipulations of SBGN-ML ﬁles, a text-
based exchange format for SBGN graphics, but it does not
provide methods for interactive Visualizations.

The biographer project is trying to address these needs by
providing an open source web-based SBGN renderer and
editor. It includes a web service for rendering SBGN and a
core library based on HTML5 that can easily be integrated
into other tools and web resources. Our software has been
tested within different environments and works in up-to-date
browsers like Firefox and Chrome.

2 SIMPLE USE CASE

The simplest method to use biographer is to Visit its interactive
editor tools at our website (see Fig. 1). This editor allows users
to create graphs from scratch by dragging glyphs onto a canvas
and connecting them Via arcs. Furthermore, it is possible to
import existing models directly from BioModels Database,
Reactome pathways or from user-provided SBML, jSBGN or
SBGN-ML ﬁles. As SBML documents by default do not contain
information on glyph or are types, these are guessed from
MIRIAM annotations (Le Novere et al., 2005) and SEC terms
(Le Novere, 2006).

After the network has been created or imported, the editor
provides several tools to customize the Visualization, e.g. to
change the glyph color or to align and distribute nodes.
Furthermore, it provides methods to layout networks using dif-
ferent algorithms. These algorithms include a force-directed

layout provided by the d3 JavaScript library (http://d3js.org/) and
two novel methods, biographer-ﬂow and biographer-grid.

Finally, the tool allows the export of the graph in the SBGN
exchange format jSBGN and in the image document formats
SVG, PDF, PNG and TIFF for further editing.

3 USE OF BIOGRAPHER IN OTHER TOOLS

Software developers can use biographer for network Visualiza-
tions on their own web sites. Given an input model in one of the
aforementioned formats, our simple web service can provide
SBGN compliant SVG images in an HTML Inlineframe.

The JavaScript API of biographer allows web applications to
dynamically change the Visualized network and its appearance.
Applications using the library include our editor, semanticSBML
(Krause et al., 2010), the NetworkExplorer (http://cheetah.
biologie.hu-berlin.de/networkexplorer/Fa tool that allows
users to interactively browse through subnetworks of a large re-
action networkiand rxncon (Tiger et al., 2012), which is able to
automatically create topological jSBGN documents for reaction
network in SBGN-Entity Relationship and SBGN-PD simultan-
eously and includes a boolean simulator with an interactive
SBGN-Activity Flow Visualization.

4 jSBGN

We have chosen to create our own JSON—based exchange
format, called jSBGN, to store and transmit SBGN images.
Our web services require an exchange format that is compact
enough to be transmitted fast over the internet and that can be
easily interpreted in scripting languages. Furthermore, jSBGN
avoids the ‘no computation’ paradigm of SBGN-ML, which
requires that all properties of all Visible elements have to be
declared in the exchanged ﬁle. For example, in jSBGN, arcs
only need to provide the source and target glyph, while the
start and end positions of the lines on the glyphs will be calcu-
lated. This concept makes the creation of jSBGN files simpler

and lowers the barrier to integrate the biographer library into
other software.

5 CONCLUSION

The Visualization of biochemical networks, which includes
metabolic, signaling and regulatory networks, has become an
important task in the ﬁeld of biology. In particular, with the
emergence of electronic databases containing large interaction
networks of biochemical species, the need for automatic or at
least semi-automatic rendering of such information has increased
drastically. Here, we present a tool that allows Visualizing and
editing of network information in web-based environments as a
stand-alone application as well as a library.

Although software systems for rendering and editing SBGN
images are available, biographer addresses several needs that
these tools do not fulﬁll yet. We believe that the SBGN standard
will be more widely used when its creation and usage is as simple
as possible.

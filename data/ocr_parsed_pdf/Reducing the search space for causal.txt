Abstract

Motivation: Increasingly, cost—effective high—throughput DNA sequencing technologies are being
utilized to sequence human pedigrees to elucidate the genetic cause of a wide variety of human
diseases. While numerous tools exist for variant prioritization within a single genome, the ability to
concurrently analyze variants within pedigrees remains a challenge, especially should there be no
prior indication ofthe underlying genetic cause ofthe disease. Here, we present a tool, variant ana—
lysis of sequenced pedigrees (VASP), a flexible data integration environment capable of producing
a summary of pedigree variation, providing relevant information such as compound heterozygos—
ity, genome phasing and disease inheritance patterns. Designed to aggregate data across a
sequenced pedigree, VASP allows both powerful filtering and custom prioritization of both single
nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small indels. Hence, clinical and research users with prior know—
ledge of a disease are able to dramatically reduce the variant search space based on a wide variety
of custom prioritization criteria.

1 Introduction

 

While exome sequencing has been successfully utilized in the discov-
ery of causal variation using small numbers of unrelated individuals
(Ng et (11., 2010) it is becoming clear that this approach is insuffi-
cient to reliably identify the genetic causes in many cases (Yang
et (11., 2013). Increasingly, genetic variation information from
related individuals is being employed to reduce the search space for

causal variants, by both the prioritization of variants common to af-
fected individuals and the exclusion of benign variants shared be-
tween affected and unaffected individuals. The effective analysis of
sequenced pedigrees requires new tools capable of combining vari-
ant specific and pedigree wide annotations with powerful filtering
options to dramatically reduce the causal variation search space.
Current tools focus on either progressively removing variants based

on criteria deemed unlikely to be causal (Li et al., 2012) or by focus—
ing on variants matching specific inheritance models [compound
heterozygotes (Kamphans et al., 2013); autosomal dominant
(Koboldt et al., 2014)]. Here, we present variant analysis of
sequenced pedigrees (VASP), a tool that integrates and summarizes
information across a sequenced pedigree without making any as—
sumptions regarding disease inheritance further providing the full
integrated pedigree variation information for subsequent prioritiza—
tion. VASP is standalone software written in Perl derived from our
original variant detection pipeline (Andrews et al., 2012).

2 Methods

VASP integrates variant information from each pedigree member and
aggregates this information on a per variant basis, describing, among
other things, the likely inheritance pattern while simultaneously incor—
porating external annotation. Furthermore, VASP uses parental allele
segregation patterns to determine phasing of variants and identifies
genomic blocks common to affected pedigree individuals. VASP and
other tools that aggregate information across a pedigree are critical
for successful causal variant detection as they automate a complex
task too labor intensive to perform manually.

2.1 Input

2.1.1 Input files

Two input files are required; a pedigree (PED) file representing pedi—
gree structure and a variant call format (VCF) file containing variant
information. The third required argument is either a variant effect pre—
dictor (VEP) annotation file (McLaIen et al., 2010) or the path to a
local VEP installation when no annotation file is readily available.
Optional input files include a text file with the path to individual
binary sequence alignment/map (BAM) files used for determining
zygosity and inheritance patterns. VASP is able to support any genome
build providing all input files refer to the same reference genome.

2.1.2 Input filters

A key feature of VASP is flexible options with prioritization and
ordering of variants based on stipulated criteria being specified at the
outset. Filtering options include specific inheritance patterns, genomic
region, gene name, population allele frequency, phasing information,
number of affected/unaffected variant individuals and certain
polyphen2 and sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) categories.
Combining parameters results in a dramatic reduction in the length of
candidate variant lists—and the remaining variants will better corres—
pond to hypotheses about the genetic basis of a particular disease.

2.1.3 Input variant set

Variant callers typically employ a quality score as a cutoff, above
which lie a set of presumed high—quality variant calls. In reality, vari—
ants above this cutoff often include false positives, whereas variants
below this cutoff include true positives (Weisenfeld et al., 2014). To
minimize and potentially avoid this problem, the union of all vari—
ants called within the pedigree is used as the initial input variant set.
This approach allows variant calls at a particular genomic position
to be reconciled across the pedigree, potentially correcting calls lying
near the cutoff for a single individual.

2.2 External variant annotation
Individual variants are annotated with VEP data including
population frequency information from dbSNP (Sherry et al., 2001)

and the 1000 genomes project (Genomes Project et al., 2010) as
well as SIFT (Kumar et al., 2009) and PolyPhen2 (Adzhubei et al.,
2010) scores for estimating the functional effect of missense
mutations.

2.3 Pedigree—wide annotation

2.3.1 Genome phasing and de novo mutations

Whenever possible the parental allele inherited by each child is
determined, and this information is clustered into genomic blocks of
presumed shared inheritance to obtain genome—phasing information.
Variants demonstrating segregation differences between affected
and unaffected children are further prioritized. In addition, any vari—
ant exhibiting Mendelian inconsistencies is annotated, with special
attention paid to putative de novo mutations (i.e. non—mutant, un—
affected parents and a heterozygous offspring).

2.3.2 Disease inheritance patterns and compound heterozygosin
For each variant in the pedigree the inheritance is determined and
annotated accordingly. The zygosity of particular variants is prefer—
entially determined from raw sequence data obtained from BAM
files using SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) but failing this the required
genotype field (GT) and optional allele depth (AD) tags from the
VCF file are utilized. Compound heterozygote genes are also anno—
tated, defined as genes containing at least one heterozygous SNV or
indel inherited from each parent with unaffected and affected sib—
lings not sharing identical heterozygous variants. These variants
must further be heterozygous in all affected individuals and not be
homozygous in any unaffected individuals. These compound hetero—
zygous genes are further prioritized in cases where each parent con—
tributes rare or novel alleles.

2.3.3 Gene variability statistics

For each gene three measures of variability are reported; total num—
ber of variants, total number of unique variant coordinates and per—
centage of total transcript bases found variant. Increased gene
variability may be relevant to particular diseases but also may be in—
dicative of read alignment issues (often due the presence of gene du—
plicates) or may indicate the gene is functionally redundant and thus
not functionally constrained.

2.4 VASP output and ordering

VASP reports contain all variants detected in at least one pedigree
member and categorises variants as either novel, rare (0—2% popula—
tion frequency), no frequency (known variant but no frequency data
available) or common (>2% frequency). For each variant VASP re—
ports both pedigree—wide information (such as inheritance pattern
or phasing data) as well as variant—specific information (such as pop—
ulation frequency or polyphen score). By default VASP reports are
sorted progressively on four measures: variant category (novel, rare,
no frequency and common), the number of variant affected samples
(in descending order), the number of unaffected variant samples and
lastly the variant population frequency.

3 Results

VASP makes no assumptions regarding the underlying disease trans—
mission mechanism, an apparent strength when compared with
similar software (Supplementary Table 51). Instead, VASP provides
powerful filters with the aim of allowing researchers to harness their
additional knowledge of the disease to generate reduced variant lists

suitable for manual interrogation. One current limitation of VASP is
that it can only be run on the command line.

Five pedigrees (Supplementary Table 52) were analyzed to calcu—
late variant segregation statistics with pedigree G1 (Supplementary
Figure 51) variant lists (Supplementary Table S3) taken forward to
illustrate the effect of various filtering strategies (Supplementary
Table S4). To date VASP has been used to analyze 45 pedigrees and
found strong candidate causal variants in 15 of these (33.3%).
These 15 pedigrees exhibit a wide array of disease transmission
mechanisms including autosomal dominant and recessive inherit—
ance, de novo mutations, compound heterozygosity and more com—
plex multi—gene cases. This variety in transmission mechanisms
within this relatively small group sharing similar diseases illustrates
the importance of flexible pedigree analysis software.

We present VASP, a flexible tool for identifying putative causal
variants from pedigree sequence data. Through aggregation of data
for genetic variants across pedigree members, VASP allows power—
ful, custom variation prioritization, taking advantage of external
datasets and prior knowledge of disease incidence and inheritance
patterns. With this tool users have the opportunity to greatly narrow
the number of candidate causal variants, using custom criteria, to a
size suitable for manual interrogation.

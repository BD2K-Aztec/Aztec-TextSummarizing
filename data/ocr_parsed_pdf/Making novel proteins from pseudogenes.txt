ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recently, we made synthetic proteins from non-coding
DNA of Escherichia coli. Encouraged by this, we asked: can we arti-
ficially express pseudogenes into novel and functional proteins? What
kind of structures would be generated? Would these proteins be
stable? How would the organism respond to the artificial reactivation
of pseudogenes?

Results: To answer these questions, we studied 16 full-length protein
equivalents of pseudogenes. The sequence-based predictions indi-
cated interesting molecular and cellular functional roles for pseudo-
gene-derived proteins. Most of the proteins were predicted to be
involved in the amino acid biosynthesis, energy metabolism, purines
and pyrimidine biosynthesis, central intermediary metabolism, trans-
port and binding. Interestingly, many of the pseudogene-derived pro-
teins were predicted to be enzymes. Furthermore, proteins showed
strong evidence of stable tertiary structures. The prediction scores for
structure, function and stability were found to be favorable in most of
the cases.

Impact: To our best knowledge, this is the first such report that
predicts the possibility of making functional and stable proteins from
pseudogenes. In future, it would be interesting to experimentally
synthesize and validate these predictions.

1 INTRODUCTION

The term ‘pseudogene’ has been derived from the term ‘pseudo’
meaning false. These genes are also known as ‘genomic fossils’
(Lafontaine and Dujon, 2010). The first pseudogene was re-
ported in SS DNA of Xenopus laevis (Jacq et al., 1977).
Pseudogenes are obsolete stretches of DNA sequences that lack
protein-coding potential owing to the presence of the frame shift
mutation and premature stop codons even though they resemble
functional genes (Mighell et al., 2000). They are considered
dysfunctional relatives of ancestral functional genes that might
have lost function during evolution (Balakirev and Ayala, 2003).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Pseudogenes have been reported in plants (Loguercio and
Wilkins, 1998), bacteria (Ochman and Davalos, 2006), yeast
(Harrison et al., 2002), insects (Ramos-Onsins and Aguadé,
1998), nematodes (Harrison et al., 2001) and mammals (Zhang
and Gerstein, 2004).

Based on their origins, pseudogenes have been categorized into
(i) processed pseudogenesiformed by retrotransposition of
mRNA and have paralogs in the same genome (Li et al.,
2013); (ii) duplicated pseudogenesisometimes called unpro-
cessed pseudogenes arise because of the duplication of functional
genes that later on acquire mutation and finally become non-
functional; and (iii) unitary or disabled pseudogenesithought
to originate through disruptive mutation in the functional
protein-coding genes (Mighell et al., 2000). As new duplicated
genes, they could serve as a source of genomic innovations,
resulting in novel functions (Presgraves, 2005). Unprocessed
and duplicated pseudogenes have introniexon structures,
whereas processed pseudogenes have exonic region only
(Nishioka et al., 1980). The long protein-coding genes tend to
produce non-processed pseudogenes, whereas short protein-
coding genes tend to produce processed pseudogenes
(Goncalves, 2000).

Currently, the origin, evolution and function of pseudogenes
are incompletely understood. The biological role of pseudogenes
were first reported nearly 15 years ago (Korneev et al., 1999) in
the form of regulating neuronal nitric oxide synthase gene
expression. Recent studies have indicated more functional roles
for pseudogenes (Li et al., 2013; Pink et al., 2011; Poliseno et a1.,
2010). The relationship between pseudogenes and long non-
coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is beginning to be understood.
Antisense RNA derived from PTEN pseudogene has been
found to regulate the transcription and mRNA stability of
PTEN tumor suppressor gene (Johnsson et al., 2013).
Pseudogene-derived non-coding RNAs ampliﬁed the expression
level of their parent gene and functioning as endogenous RNAs
with the PTEN pseudogene. Further, pseudogene-derived small
RNAs have been found to play a role in regional chromatin
repression (Guo et al., 2014).

Recent evidences indicate involvement of pseudogenes in reg-
ulating the growth of organism (Li et al., 2013) by acting as
miRNA decoy (Marques et al., 2012) encoding short peptides
or proteins (Bertrand et al., 2002; Kandouz et al., 2004).
Studies show that siRNAs derived from pseudogenes of

African Trypanosoma brucei suppress the gene expression
through RNA interference (Wen et al., 2011).

Given their mechanisms of origins, development of these se-
quences over evolutionary scale of complexity and their potential
functional roles, pseudogenes make a strong case for understand-
ing fundamental biology and generating novel applications.

In this bioinformatics study on pseudogenes, our aim was to
predict proﬁle of proteins that can be made on demand. This
thought has origins in our previous study (Dhar et al., 2009)
where the feasibility of experimentally making novel and func-
tional proteins from non-coding DNA was demonstrated.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is among the most well-studied
organism where pseudogenes have been identiﬁed and analyzed
(Lafontaine and Dujon, 2010). It is also one of the most precisely
sequenced and annotated eukaryotic genome (Brachat et al.,
2003). Due to this reason, S.cerevisiae was considered in the
present study.

2 METHODS

The Saccharomyces Genome Database version of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae S288C was used in the present study. A total of 20 pseudogene
sequences were retrieved using the yeast mine tool and computationally
translated into protein sequences using Transeq tool of European
Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) (Alvarez-Perez et al., 2013; Goujon
et al., 2010; Hoefman et al., 2014; Rice et al., 2000). From this dataset,
16 full-length pseudogenes were found that translated into complete pro-
tein sequences without any intervening stop codons. 4 pseudogenes with
intervening stop codons was excluded. Thus, in this work, only 16 se-
quences were considered for detailed study.

2.1 Sequence-based functional prediction

The functional relatives of pseudogene-derived proteins were identiﬁed
using the BLAST analysis (Altschul et al., 1990). The function of pseudo-
gene-derived protein and its relatives was studied using ProtFun tool
(Jensen et al., 2002, 2003). Protein localization of these sequences was
studied using the WOLF PSORT server (Horton et al., 2007). STRING
database (Franceschini et al., 2013) was used to predict physical and
functional association network of proteins. The physiochemical proper-
ties of pseudogene sequences [molecular weight, theoretical pl, aliphatic
index (Ikai, 1980) and GRAVY (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982)] were pre-
dicted using the Expasy Protparam server (Gasteiger, 2003), and mRNA
secondary structure or folding patterns of pseudogenes were predicted
using Mfold server (Zuker, 2003). The 3D structures of pseudogenes
were predicted using I-TASSER (Zhang, 2008). Of the 16 sequences
considered for the study, ﬁve sequences that displayed functional features
were ﬁnally selected for stability prediction.

2.2 Stability of proteins

To compute the number of stabilization centers, pseudogene sequences
were evaluated using SCide (Dosztanyi et al., 2003). Sequences showing
evidence of stabilization centers were considered for calculating the total
energy, including bonds, angles and torsion, improper, non-bonded and
electrostatic constrains. While the total energy of the molecule was cal-
culated using GROMAS69 force ﬁeld implemented in Swiss pdb viewer
(Guex and Peitsch, 1997), the cationin interaction energies were calcu-
lated using the CaPTURE program (Gallivan and Dougherty, 1999). The
non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic inter-
actions, disulphide bridges and salt bridges (Baker and Hubbard, 1984;
Berman, 1993; Creighton, 2005; Dill, 1990; Horovitz et al., 1990; Lins and
Brasseur, 1995; Pace et al., 1996) were computed using WHAT IF

(Vriend, 1990) and PIC Web server (Tina et al., 2007). The RASMOL
(Sayle, 1995) molecular visualization software was used to visualize the
interactions wherein non-canonical interactions, i.e. CiH. . . .21,
CiH. . . .O and NiH. . . .n interactions were computed using HBAT pro-
gram (Tiwari and Panigrahi, 2007). These intermolecular interactions
calculated by HBAT were visualized using RasMol, implemented as an
add-on program in HBAT. The instability index was calculated based on
a weight value using the Expasy Protparam server.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Sequence-based function prediction

3.1.1 Predicting the function of the pseudogene Pseudogene-
encoded proteins were evaluated for their functions using
ProtFun tool leading to the following functions: amino acid
biosynthesis (25%), energy metabolism (19%), central intermedi-
ary metabolism (13%), purines and pyrimidines biosynthesis
(13%), cell envelope (6%), regulatory functions (6%), fatty
acid metabolism (6%), translation (6%), transport and binding
(6%) (Table 1).

3.1.2 Identifying functional relatives Of the 16 pseudogene pro-
teins, 8 of them (50%) showed the same function as their imme-
diate relatives (Table 1). Pseudogene-derived proteins were found
to map to central intermediary metabolism, energy metabolism,
amino acid biosynthesis, purine and pyrimidine synthesis, trans-
port and binding.

3.1.3 Predicting subcellular localization Localization of proteins
is an indication of their probable role in the cell. The WoLF
PSORT predicted most of the proteins to be localized to cytosol
(31%), cytosol and nucleus (25%), nucleus (19%), mitochondria
(13%), plasma membrane (6%) and extracellular membrane
(6%) (Table 1).

3.1.4 Predicting protein-protein interactions Certain pseudo-
gene-derived proteins were found to have interacting partners
showing functions like hexose transporter (sugar transporter),
L-serine/threonine dehydratases, dehydrogenase and serine
hydrolase (Supplementary Fig. S1). Approximately one-third
(31.25%) of the proteins were found to have interacting partners
with either uncharacterized or hypothetical proteins. 12.5% of
the pseudogene-derived protein sequences did not show any
interacting partners.

As an example to highlight the importance of interaction in-
formation, the proteiniprotein network of EKA-9 (Fig. 1)
showed interaction with serine dehydratases signature proteins.
Pseudogene-derived proteins are shown to interact with various
proteins that are experimentally validated further involving
various biochemical pathways. From the pathway analysis, we
observe that some of these pseudogenes interact with hexose
transporter (I-IXT) families, which are linked to several unknown
physiological functions further showing strong similarity with
cell cycle mediators apart from its peers. These are involved in
pathways speciﬁc to the cell cycle and glucose, whereas proteins
shown interacting with pseudogenes are involved in glycine,
serine and threonine metabolism, cysteine and methionine
metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acid and citrate cycle
pathways.

3.1.5 Predicting physiochemical properties Pseudogene proteins
were studied for physicochemical properties (molecular weight,
theoretical isoelectric point, aliphatic index and hydropathicity).
Molecular weight of proteins was found to range from 7.42 KDa
to 127.18 KDa. The isoelectric point (pI) value of proteins was
found to vary from 4.67 to 9.54 (pI <7 show acidic nature
whereas pI >7 indicate basic nature), aliphatic index value ran-
ging from 64.03 to 102.57 (relatively higher value shows greater
stability), hydropathicity value (return of GRAVY score) ran-
ging from e0.734 to 0.443 indicates better interaction with water,
as value ranges are low (Table 2).

3.1.6 Tertiary structure prediction The tertiary structure of 16
pseudogene-encoded protein sequences was predicted using
I-TASSER server. The I-TASSER conﬁdence score indicates

Gm"

 

Fig. 1. Protein-protein interaction network of EKA-9

the quality of predicted models based on ab initio and threading
algorithm. Structures were predicted with C-score varying from
4 to 0.62 (optimal range 5 to 2) while considering the paradigm
greater the C-score, greater is the possibility of a good tertiary
structure (Supplementary Table S1).

3.2 Predicting stability

3.2.1 Stabilization centers, cationerr, non-covalent and non-cano-
nical interactions Based on the results obtained from the func-
tion prediction, ﬁve pseudogenes showing top-most function hits
were considered for stability prediction. A11 predicted protein
sequences showed low negative value for the total energy indicat-
ing that pseudogene-derived proteins would be probably stable, if
expressed (Table 3). Approximately 40% of the proteins ex-
hibited stabilization centers ranging from 40 to 100 with rest of
the proteins equally distributed (20% each) across the rest of the
stabilization centers (Table 3).

Studies on protein stability among the ﬁve sequences con-
sidered revealed remarkable observations with one showing
>20 cationerr interactions, three showing the presence of <5 cat-
ionerr interactions and one not showing any cationerr interaction
(Table 3). EKA-16 showed highest number of non-covalent
interactions (1018) and non-canonical interactions (218) followed
by EKA-8 and EKA-15. Table 4 describes non-covalent inter-
actions, and Table 5 describes non-canonical interactions.

The MFOLD results (Table 3) showed EKA-13 (e73.1kca1/
mol) and EKA-9 (e95.2kcal/mol) with higher AG, whereas
EKA-16 (e740 kcal/mol) and EKA-15 (e201.6kcal/mol)
showed relatively lower AG.

3.2.2 Predicting instability index Sequences showed instability
index ranging from 29.92 to 51.4 (Table 3) indicating that most
of the proteins are likely to be stable, if expressed.

3.3 Correlation of stability parameters

A nearly consistent trend for all stability parameters was found
for all the pseudogene-encoded proteins (Fig. 2). From these
data, we infer that the total energy of the folded structures is
in the favorable range (Fig. 3). Further, non-canonical

4 DISCUSSION

The present study is an extension of previous work (Dhar et al.,
2009) where Escherichia coli non-coding DNA sequences were
artiﬁcially expressed into functional proteins. This gave rise to a
new questioniwhat would happen if we artiﬁcially expressed
pseudogene sequences? Would they make stable and functional
proteins? How would their structure look like? What kind of
molecules would they interact with? Given their increasingly
complex role at both genetic and epigenetic levels (Guo et al.,

2014), this study attempts to present a novel way of understand-
ing pseudogene biology by artificially expressing candidate
sequences that show most promising leads.

Of the 20 pseudogenes that were computationally translated to
protein sequences, 16 sequences gave full-length open reading
frames (ORF) without any stop codons and were considered in
this study. To understand potential property of pseudogene pro-
teins, sequence-based and structure-based prediction studies were
performed using the best computational tools available.

Before this step, pseudogene sequences were sent for RNA
structure prediction based on the reasoning that if pseudogene
mRNA assumes a rigid secondary structure, it would be difﬁcult
to artiﬁcially synthesize proteins. Reports suggest that ‘highly
expressed genes’ may not show stable mRNA secondary
structure, whereas ‘low expressed genes’ may show highly stable
mRNA secondary structure (Drummond et al., 2005; Mukund
et al.,1999). Thus, higher the value of AG, lower the possibility
of forming a stable mRNA secondary structure. A11 pseudogene
proteins exhibited AG ranging from e740 kcal/mol to e73.1 kcal/
mol (Table 3) indicating that pseudogenes may have been possibly
low-expressing genes in the past when they were in an active state.
It would be interesting to see how they behave when artiﬁcially
expressed using both a weak and a strong promoter.

To strengthen pseudogene predictions for experimental valid-
ation, it is important to address the reliability of function pre-
dictions. Functions of selected pseudogenes and its relatives were

predicted using sequence information, as tools have been
developed that reliably predict the function from sequence data
(Jensen et al. 2002, 2003). It was found that many pseudogene-
encoded proteins (EKA-1, EKA-4, EKA-5, EKA-7, EKA-8,
EKA-10, EKA-14 and EKA-15) had function similar to that
of their relatives (Table 1). Furthermore, several pseudogene
proteins were predicted to play a role in amino acid biosynthesis
and energy metabolism. We found that three pseudogenes
(EKA-8, EKA-9 and EKA-15) from the set of 16 pseudogenes
showed similar functions based on both proteineprotein
interaction network and Gene Ontology predictions.

Majority of pseudogene proteins were found to localize to
cytosol. Interestingly, pseudogene-encoded proteins (EKA-5,
EKA-12 and EKA-15) that show up in the energy metabolism
category also localize to cytosol (cytoplasm), thus strengthening
the belief in predictions. Proteins with regulatory functions
(EKA-2) were also localized to cytosol (cytoplasm).
Interestingly, EKA-7 and EKA-11 showing up under purines
and pyrimidines biosynthesis functional category were found to
be localized to the nucleus subcellular compartment (Table 1).

It was encouraging to observe that predicted pseudogene
proteins showed high aliphatic index values and lower instability
index indicating greater stability, if expressed. The low hydro-
phobicity score of predicted proteins indicate their polar nature.

Tertiary structure of potential pseudogene proteins was deter-
mined by using I-TASSER because of the wide acceptance of this
tool in the community. The quality of model is estimated based
on the C-score. The convergence parameters of the structure
assembly simulations and threading template alignments are
used for calculating the C-score. Typically, C-score value is be-
tween e5 and 2, where higher value of C-score indicates a model
with a high confidence and Vice versa. The C-score value for all
pseudogene proteins was found to be in the range of e4 to 0.58,
indicating a strong foldability of the predicted proteins

Structural stability of proteins is an important indicator of
their potential function (Ramanathan et al., 2011). To further
understand the strength of structural predictions, we studied
proteins using stability parameters like stabilization centers,
total energy, cationerr interaction energies, non-covalent, non-
canonical interaction and instability index, and encouraging evi-
dence of protein structure stability was found (Tables 35).
Further, the total energy of the proteins was calculated using
GROMACS force ﬁeldiwherein the lower the energy, the
higher the possibility of stable conﬁguration. The total energy
of all the proteins individually was found to be negative (Table 3)
indicating that all the proteins are likely to exhibit a stable struc-
ture, if expressed. Further, 5 of the 16 proteins exhibited several
stabilization centers. Among all the proteins, EKA-8 and EKA-
16 were found to have the lowest energy and highest numbers of
stabilization centers (Table 3).

We also studied non-covalent interactions like hydrogen
bonds, hydrophobic interactions, disulphide bridges, salt bridges
and cationerr interactions in these proteins. The data obtained
under all these categories give a strong indication of stable fold-
ability of proteins. Among all the proteins, EKA-16 and EKA-8
show presence of higher non-covalent interaction indicating
better stability (Table 4). These two proteins also showed the
highest number of non-canonical interactions suggesting higher
structural stability of proteins thus lending support to the 3D

structure stability proﬁles (Ramanathan et al., 2011; Umezawa
and Nishio, 1998).

Finally, to validate the strength of stability predictions, we
performed tests that examine instability of these proteins. The
instability index indicates whether a protein would be unstable
in vivo (Guruprasad et al., 1990Fthe instability index of <40 is
considered as a good evidence of stability (Ramanathan et al.,
2011). Interestingly, EKA-15 sequence exhibited the lowest
instability followed by EKA-9, EKA-8 and EKA-16 (Table 3).

Overall, this study suggests that EKA-8 (Fig. 6) and EKA-16
(Fig. 7) are the two most promising pseudogenes for artiﬁcial
expression into proteins. Experiments have been started to
validate these predictions. It would be interesting to see how
cell responds to deliberate expression of sequences that nature
decided to switch off. Given the context dependency and emer-
gent properties arising from protein interactions (Banerji, 2013),
it would be interesting to see the experimental outcome of
artiﬁcial pseudogene expression.

5 CONCLUSION

This work explores the possibility of making stable and func-
tional proteins from pseudogenes. A comprehensive multi-para—
metric study, based on sequence and structural evidences
identiﬁes two pseudogenes (EKA 8 and EKA 16) as the most
promising candidates for the future artiﬁcial protein synthesis
and functional studies.

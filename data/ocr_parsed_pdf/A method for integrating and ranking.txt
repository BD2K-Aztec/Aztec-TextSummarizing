ABSTRACT

Motivation: To create, verify and maintain pathway models, curators
must discover and assess knowledge distributed over the vast body of
biological literature. Methods supporting these tasks must understand
both the pathway model representations and the natural language in
the literature. These methods should identify and order documents by
relevance to any given pathway reaction. No existing system has ad-
dressed all aspects of this challenge.

Method: We present novel methods for associating pathway model
reactions with relevant publications. Our approach extracts the reac-
tions directly from the models and then turns them into queries for
three text mining-based MEDLINE literature search systems. These
queries are executed, and the resulting documents are combined
and ranked according to their relevance to the reactions of interest.
We manually annotate document-reaction pairs with the relevance of
the document to the reaction and use this annotation to study several
ranking methods, using various heuristic and machine-learning
approaches.

Results: Our evaluation shows that the annotated document-reaction
pairs can be used to create a rule-based document ranking system,
and that machine learning can be used to rank documents by their
relevance to pathway reactions. We find that a Support Vector
Machine-based system outperforms several baselines and matches
the performance of the rule-based system. The success of the query
extraction and ranking methods are used to update our existing path-
way search system, PathText.

1 INTRODUCTION

The scale and speed with which biological literature is published
introduces multiple challenges for the creation, veriﬁcation,
maintenance and further development of formal, comprehensive
and up-to-date models of the physical entities and reactions
involved in biological systems (Ananiadou et al., 2006; Kitano,
2002). Efforts to understand a complex biological system in
detail need to incorporate knowledge that may be distributed
over a large number of scientiﬁc publications from among the
tens of millions available today. To reduce the demands of dis-
covering and integrating this knowledge, several text mining

systems have been proposed (Park et al., 2001; Rajagopalan
and Agarwal, 2005; thetsky et al., 2004; Yao et al., 2004;
Yuryev et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2009), which address many
of the aspects of pathway curation. However, despite the obvious
potential that automatic analysis of the literature holds for as-
sisting large-scale integration of biological knowledge, pathway
curation efforts remain largely manual (Herrgard et al., 2008;
Swainston et al., 2011; Thiele and Palsson, 2010), carried out
with limited or no support from advanced text mining methods.
One way to try to remedy this situation is through the use of
semantic search systems that make use of these methods.
However, there are several technical challenges to overcome,
such as interfacing with such systems and integrating informa-
tion from various systems in a coherent way, as well as the fact
that few semantic search systems directly involve either the rep-
resentations or the semantics (physical entity and reaction deﬁn-
itions) used in pathway model curation efforts.

To address these issues and support pathway curation, we have
developed PathText 2, an integrated search system designed to
link biological pathways with supporting knowledge in the vast
body of literature. Given a pathway model and a reaction, the
system is able to ﬁnd documents that are relevant to the given
reaction from MEDLINE. The literature search in PathText2 is
implemented by translating each reaction into a set of queries that
are then executed using several semantic search systems. The re-
sults of the queries are then combined, ranked and presented to
the user in a unified user interface. With these pathway-speciﬁc
functions, i.e. the reaction-based retrieval of documents and
ranking of uniﬁed documents by their relevance to pathway reac-
tions, PathText2 aims to reduce the number of documents cur-
ators need to focus on, thus increasing the productivity of
pathway curation. The documents retrieved by PathText2 can
help curators to maintain the textual evidence for reactions and
to extend pathways by finding related reactions from the docu-
ments. PathText2 is designed to read formal pathway models
represented in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)
(Hucka et al., 2003) with CellDesigner (Funahashi et al., 2003)
extensions. SBML is a major standard format for pathway rep-
resentation and interchange, and its use assures compatibility with
a large ecosystem of existing pathway curation tools and
resources. CellDesigner extensions are essential for determining
the correct participants in the reaction in our system; SBML itself
does not deﬁne a ﬁxed set of semantic types for its primitives but
instead defines an extension mechanism (e. g. Courtot et al., 201 1),
allowing such types to be deﬁned (Le Novre et al., 2005).

PathText2 is a comprehensive enhancement of a previously
released system, PathText (Kemper et al., 2010). PathText2

extends the core functionality of PathText by combining the
multiple results received for a single document from the various
semantic search systems into a single result, introducing a new
document ranking heuristic based on the relevance of the docu-
ment to the given reaction, offering a new API allowing other
systems to easily interface with the system and supporting a
novel interface for human users to access the system.
Furthermore, we have updated the individual semantic search
systems that are queried by PathText2 and updated the gener-
ation of queries applicable to these systems. This is done by im-
plementing a query generation and expansion system based on
reaction-event mapping (Ohta et al., 2011). As we are trying to
support improved automatic association between pathway
models and documents, we have removed previous PathText
functionality for the manual annotation and association of docu-
ments with pathways. The improved query generation and rank-
ing of the results should make this functionality obsolete, thus
reducing the burden on curators.

We evaluate PathText2 in detail on two corpora annotated by
domain experts, both containing judgments on the relevance of
various documents to speciﬁc pathway model reactions. The
evaluation shows that use of PathText2 substantially improves
on PubMed search for discovering relevant documents, that the
annotations can support the development of heuristics for docu-
ment ranking and that the task of determining document-
reaction relevance is feasible using machine learning methods.

2 PATHTEXT2 ARCHITECTURE

The overall architecture of PathText2 is illustrated in Figure 1.
PathText2 currently supports SBML, which is the primary
format used for major pathway repositories such as BioModels
(Novere et al., 2006) and has been characterized as the most
successful standard model exchange format for encoding
pathway models (Li et al., 2010). PathText2 speciﬁes reaction
semantics using the CellDesigner (Funahashi et al., 2003) types
in SBML. CellDesigner is a popular tool for pathway model
curation, and the SBML models in major resources such as
PANTHER DB (Mi et al., 2007) contain CellDesigner types.
We discuss generalization from SBML/CellDesigner to other
representations in Section 5.

PathText2 interprets the SMBL models and uses the infor-
mation to interact with various semantic search systems (see
Section 2.1). To interact with these systems, PathText2 contains

query generation modules, which translate a given pathway re-
action from the model into a set of queries formatted for use with
each of the search systems (Section 2.2). In response to these
queries, each system returns a set of documents; these result
sets are merged (so that each document only occurs once),
ranked and returned back to the user. The user interface is cov-
ered in Section 2.3.

2.1 Text mining-based semantic search systems

PathText2 integrates three state-of-the-art text mining-based
semantic search systems: FACTA+ (Tsuruoka et al., 2011),
KLEIO (Nobata et al., 2008) and MEDIE (Miyao et al.,
2006). Each of these systems is presented brieﬂy later in the
text; we refer readers to the publications introducing the systems
for detailed descriptions.

FACTA+, an extension of the FACTA system, provides real-
time search of direct and indirect associations between biological
concepts in MEDLINE abstracts as well as abstracts discussing
these concepts. FACTA+ indexes concepts from the abstracts
including genes, proteins, diseases, symptoms, drugs, enzymes
and simple chemical compounds, identiﬁed using biological data-
bases and thesauri such as UniProt, BioThesaurus, Uniﬁed
Medical Language System (UMLS), KEGG and DrugBank.
The user interacts with the system by issuing queries in the
form of a word, a concept identiﬁer or any Boolean combination
of words and/or identiﬁers. The web-based user interface shows
the results grouped by concepts and ranked according to a choice
of co-occurrence statistics (frequency, pointwise mutual informa-
tion or symmetric conditional probability). FACTA+ addition-
ally includes an indirect search function, which can ﬁnd an
association between a query and a target concept via another
concept even if the query and target never co-occur in any
publication.

KLEIO is a semantic search system for MEDLINE. It incorp-
orates methods for acronym recognition and disambiguation
(Okazaki and Ananiadou, 2006; Okazaki et al., 2010), term nor-
malization (Tsuruoka et al., 2007), gene/protein name recogni-
tion (Okanohara et al., 2006) and species recognition and gene/
protein species disambiguation (Wang et al., 2010) to improve
and expand standard literature querying with semantic categories
and faceted search. This allows the user to limit the results by
specifying semantic categories to which the query words belong
(e. g. ‘PROTEIN :hedgehog’ would ﬁnd occurrences of the hedge-
hog protein, as opposed to the animal of the same name). The
retrieved MEDLINE abstracts are annotated with biological
concepts including genes, proteins, metabolites, bacteria,
organs, symptoms, diseases and species. The recognized proteins
and genes are additionally augmented by automatically disam-
biguated species information.

MEDIE is a search engine that can be used to query
MEDLINE abstracts based on named entity recognition and
normalized syntactic structures produced by deep parsing. The
indexing component is supported by the automatic entity taggers
NEMine (Sasaki et al., 2008) and NERsuite (http://nersuite.
n1plab.org) and the deep parser Enju (Miyao and Tsujii, 2008),
which abstracts over syntactic variability by analysing text in
terms of predicate-argument structures. MEDIE can search for
documents on the basis of subject-verb-object (SVO) triples

expressing associations between entities. SVO searches are ex-
pressed in terms of three fields: the subject, verb and object.
Any of these fields can be left empty, in which case the search
engine will ignore that field, thus allowing for queries such as
‘what causes cancer’, by leaving the subject blank, setting the
verb to ‘cause’ and the object to ‘cancer’. Analyses from the
event extraction system EventMine (Miwa et al., 2012) were
also recently incorporated into the MEDIE index. This system
produces events, which are typed n-ary associations that involve
an event trigger (usually a verb signifying an action, such as
‘induce’) and a set of participants identiﬁed as playing speciﬁc
roles in the event (e. g. Theme, Cause). Event participants may be
either named entities, such as proteins and genes, or other events
(Ananiadou et al., 2010). Figure 2 provides an illustration of an
event structure. To allow for the querying of arbitrary event
structures, a new event-based search interface was added to
MEDIE, alongside the existing SVO-based interface. This inter-
face also supports queries in which only a portion of an event
structure has been speciﬁed.

In addition to a web-based user interface, each of the systems
described additionally exposes a web service interface that can be
used to access the systems programmatically. These web services
are used by PathText2 when executing queries. The use of these
web service calls makes it relatively easy to extend the system
to use other semantic search systems as they become available.
The only requirement would be to write a module to interface
between PathText2 and the new system.

2.2 Query generation

For each semantic search system, PathText2 provides a query
generation module that understands the capabilities of the
system and implements a mapping between the semantics of the
source pathway model and those applied in the semantic search
system. To realize these modules, a set of query generation rules
was constructed based on the reaction-event mapping identiﬁed in
our previous study (Ohta et al., 2011). Table 1 illustrates some of
these mappings. As an example, consider that pathway

“Cause!— Theme —! Theme -_

Vii induces proteasomaldegradation of A36

Fig. 2. Illustration of event representation

Table 1. Top-level correspondences for reaction-event mapping

representations in models typically explicitly identify all reaction
participants, such as the gene and mRNA entities in Transcription
reactions. However, not all such elements need to be stated in text,
where expressions such as ‘transcription of p53’ can (implicitly)
identify both DNA and mRNA entities. The text-oriented event
representation thus only requires a single Theme entity for tran-
scription events. Mapping Transcription reaction reactants to the
Theme participants of events permits comparable interpretation.

The queries are generated from a given reaction by applying a
series of rules; these use information such as the reaction type,
reactants, products, modiﬁcation type and modiﬁers, as well as
the states of the reactants and products. The full set of detailed
query generation rules and query speciﬁcations are provided in
the Supplementary Information.

PathText2 includes the following modules:

Query generation for FACTA+: Depending on the reaction
type, the FACTA+ query terms are made up of a conjunction
of a subset of the reactants, products and modiﬁers of the reac-
tion. The query may not contain all of these items, as, depending
on the type of reaction being described, the text may not be
expected to contain all of the details of the reaction. For ex-
ample, CellDesigner degradation reactions have products of the
type degraded, which is not expected to appear in text. When a
reaction does not match any of the known types, the
FACTA+ query consists of the conjunction of all of the react-
ants and products of the reaction.

Query generation for KLEIO: As with FACTA+, the KLEIO
query terms are made up of a conjunction of a subset of the
reactants, products and modiﬁers for a reaction depending on
the reaction type, but with the addition of KLEIO’s semantic
types (PROTEIN, DISEASE, METABOLITE, etc.) to identify
the correct semantic type for each query term. A mapping is
provided between the species types present in the pathway
models and these semantic types; for example, a pathway
model species with name ‘p53’ and the SBML/CellDesigner
type celldesigner:protein is mapped to produce the KLEIO
query term ‘PROTEIN:p53’. Types for which no correspondence
is deﬁned in the KLEIO type system are mapped to basic key-
word queries, similar to those generated for FACTA+. As with
FACTA+, where the reaction type does not match the known

type, the query will consist of the conjunction of all of the prod-
ucts and reactants of the reaction.

Query generation for MEDIE: The system generates queries for
both SVO and event-structure modules. SVO queries are gener-
ated from the mapping shown in Table 1 as follows: the Cause
argument in the event representation, when present, is used as the
subject, the most frequent verb for each reaction type as anno-
tated in the GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2008) is used as the verb
and the Theme argument is used as the object. In addition, spe-
ciﬁc rules are applied to a few reaction types. For example, the
most frequent verb of the event Localization is ‘localize’, which
only takes a subject; therefore, the Theme argument is mapped to
the subject, and atLoc and toLoc, speciﬁc to this reaction type,
are added as keywords. MEDIE event-structure queries are gen-
erated directly following the event-reaction mapping provided in
Table 1.

Query Expansion for MEDIE Event Query: MEDIE event
queries can optionally be expanded using two complementary
approaches: entity expansion and event expansion. Entity expan-
sion performs a rule-based semantic decomposition of the entities
participating in the reaction, e. g. ‘Mink1/2’ will become ‘Minkl’
and ‘Mink2’. Event expansion introduces additional queries that
are combinatorial variants of the unexpanded form, e. g. a query
for a Binding event with n Theme arguments will be augmented
with additional queries for Binding events with 1 to n — 1 Theme
arguments.

2.3 User interface and programmatic access

PathText2 offers a web-based user interface and a web service
API for programmatic access. Both offer the same functionality
for searching the literature for a given reaction in a provided
pathway model. They take as input an SMBL/CellDesigner
model in XML format and a reaction ID that identifies the re-
action of interest in the model and return a list of ranked refer-
ences. Each returned reference consists of a PubMed ID, a
snippet of text that provides evidence supporting the reaction
and a conﬁdence level with which the reference matches the
query (Fig. 1). Additionally, two Boolean parameters control
whether to perform entity expansion and/or event expansion
(Section 2.2). A screenshot of the PathText2 web interface is
shown in Figure 3.

3 DOCUMENT-REACTION RELEVANCE RANKING

User feedback for the PathText system indicated that it would be
useful to combine the results of the various semantic search sys-
tems, ensuring that no document appeared more than once. It was
also requested that this set should be ranked according to the
relevance of the document to the reaction. To address these desi-
derata, PathText 2 performs document combination and also in-
cludes various functions for document ranking. In this section, we
present the details of the document-reaction relevance ranking.

We formulate the task as follows. Firstly, we assume that the
ranking of documents by relevance to a given reaction is inde-
pendent of other reactions in the pathway, and we consider a
single reaction at a time. The ranking method is provided with a
reaction, the set of queries generated for each semantic search
system for the reaction (Section 2.2) and the response of the
systems to these queries. The response to each query consists
of an ordered set of documents, each of which may additionally
be associated with system-speciﬁc information, such as the enti-
ties recognized in the document. The ranking method must pro-
duce a document list containing the union of document sets
provided. The aim, then, is to order this list so that documents
most relevant to the given reaction occur ﬁrst.

To address this task, we manually annotated reaction-docu-
ment pairs with the relevance of the documents to each reaction
(Section 3.1). These annotations were then used to develop novel
methods for combining the results of the semantic search systems
and ranking documents (Section 3.2), which were further vali-
dated through an independent second round of annotation. The
experimental setup is described in Section 3.3.

3.1 Corpus annotation

We initially created a corpus of pathway reaction-document
pairs manually annotated using four levels of relevance: NOT
RELEVANT, PARTLY RELEVANT, RELEVANT and HIGHLY RELEVANT
(for detailed definitions, see Supplementary Material). These
data were used to train the document-reaction ranking in
PathText2 and for the primary evaluation.

To create the corpus, we initially selected from the PANTHER
DB a set of prominent pathway models of interest that were fa-
miliar to our domain experts: the p38 MAPK, p53, p53 feedback-
loops and Wnt signalling pathways. We then selected reactions
that activated the speciﬁc reaction-query mappings of PathText 2
(Section 2.2). Results obtained from the semantic search systems
were then combined and ranked using a simple Average hit ratio
ranking heuristic (described in Section 3.2). To ensure that we had
a sufﬁcient number of candidate documents to enable the meas-
urement of differences between ranking methods, we selected a set
of reactions from each pathway for which at least 10 candidate
documents were identified by PathText 2. We then took a random
sample of these reactions for manual annotation. This corpus was
used only to study the document ranking methods. We did not use
this corpus to assess the recall, as PathText2 itself was used to
obtain the set of candidate documents and reactions.

Table 2 shows the annotation statistics for the 45 randomly
selected reactions and the 450 evaluated documents (exactly 10
per reaction). Relatively few of the documents state the specified
reaction explicitly; this is because in pathway models, combined
biological phenomena (e.g. Phosphorylation and Activation) can

be represented in a single reaction. Where a document was found
to state only part of the reaction, it was judged as PARTLY
RELEVANT.

NOT RELEVANT is the most frequent single judgment over the
four pathways in the corpus. One reason identiﬁed for these false
positives was a failure in the underlying entity recognition
common to each of the search systems; this can be attributed
to ambiguous biomolecule names or incorrect synonym expan-
sion. Another possible reason is a failure in the event extraction
used to build the MEDIE event search system; this can be attrib-
uted to a mismatch between the event type and the reaction, or
an incorrect assignment of participant roles (e.g. Theme and
Cause might be swapped). In addition, our annotation guidelines
are strict; for example, documents retrieved for a Heterodimer/
Multimer association reaction were required to explicitly refer to
binding involving all the reactants to be judged as HIGHLY
RELEVANT. The detailed annotation guidelines are provided as
Supplementary Material.

3.2 Ranking methods

We implemented and evaluated the following methods for ranking
documents according to their relevance to a given pathway reac-
tion. For all methods, the newer documents (according to the pub-
lication date) are ranked ﬁrst in cases where the scores are equal.

Random: This method simply takes the union of the docu-
ments returned by the semantic search systems and creates a
randomly sorted list of the documents. This naive method estab-
lishes a lower bound on performance.

BM25: This method ranks the documents using the Okapi
BM25 (Robertson et al., 1999) ranking function, which is often
used as a baseline for ranking in keyword-matching-based search
systems. To calculate BM25 scores, bag-of-words queries (OR
queries) are generated by decomposing FACTA + queries, docu-
ment frequencies of the queries and the average document length
are calculated by using the entire PubMed abstracts, and the
parameters k1: 1.2 and b = 0.75 are used. This method is
used as a baseline for the performance of document ranking.

Average hit ratio: For a given reaction and semantic search
system, we deﬁne the hit ratio for each document as the fraction
of queries generated by PathText2 that retrieve the document.
This score has the range [0,1] and so can be compared, regardless
of the number of queries generated. This method orders

documents by the average hit ratio across the semantic search
systems for each document.

Priority ranking: Scoring by average hit ratio implicitly as-
sumes that the effectiveness of the various semantic search sys-
tems at recognizing relevant documents is equal, which may not
hold in practice. We therefore define a heuristic that gives prior-
ity to systems whose evaluation on training data indicates to be
more effective (Section 4). Speciﬁcally, the hit ratio for MEDIE
event is considered first, followed by MEDIE SVO, then KLEIO
and ﬁnally FACTA+. When choosing the order between any
two documents, the hit ratios of the documents are compared
in this order in turn; the document that comes first is the one
with the highest value for the ﬁrst ratio that is not equal. Thus, if
a pair of documents has the same hit ratio for the MEDIE event
system, MEDIE SVO scores will be used, unless these are equal,
in which case KLEIO scores are used and so on.

Machine learning with annotated corpus: Several machine-
learning methods have been used in merging results from several
search engines (Shokouhi and Si, 2011). This task has been trea-
ted as classiﬁcation (Si and Callan, 2003), regression (He et al.,
2011; Shokouhi and Zobel, 2009) and ranking (J oachims, 2002)
problems. We also treated the task according to these three prob-
lem types and solved each problem individually, using the pri-
mary annotated corpus data (Section 3.1) for training. We
implemented three machine learning-based ranking components
using the following learning methods: support vector machines
(SVM) (V apnik, 1998), support vector regression (SVR)
(Drucker et al., 1996) and ranking SVM (RankSVM)
(Joachims, 2002). We used documents annotated with the rele-
vance labels as input to the machine-learning methods, and we
trained the SVM classiﬁer to predict the relevance label for each
document and used these predictions for ranking. The SVR
method is similarly trained to predict the document relevance
label, but it uses a regression model. For SVR training, we
mapped the relevance labels to scores, from 0 (NOT RELEVANT)
to 3 (HIGHLY RELEVANT). In contrast to these point-wise methods,
the RankSVM method constructs a binary SVM classiﬁer that
predicts which of a given pair of inputs should be ranked higher.
RankSVM was trained on document pairs, with the order of the
pair derived from the relevance labels; those with the same rele-
vance label are ignored.

All of the machine-learning methods were applied using the
following set of features: (i) hit ratio of each system without
query expansion; (ii) hit ratio of MEDIE event with query expan-
sion; (iii) number of hits for each system without query expansion
and (iv) number of hits for MEDIE event with query expansion.
We chose these features, as they match the elements that make up
the heuristic rules; the comparison between the heuristic rules and
machine-learning methods can then show if machine-learning
methods perform better with the same information.

Machine learning with curated pathways: To explore the poten-
tial for previously released pathway annotations to support the
ranking task, we extracted reaction-document pairs from PubMed
IDs found in comments attached to pathway model reactions. In
all, 3586 reaction-document pairs were annotated in five manually
curated pathway models (Caron2010mTOR SignalingNetwork,

Integrating the evidence for pathways from text

 

EGFR signaling for RTKC) in the BioModels database.
PathText2 was used to retrieve up to 1000 documents for each
reaction, giving 530 reaction-document pairs. We note that the
relevance of these documents is based on the full texts, not ab-
stracts, that this approach does not provide a way to distinguish
between different levels of relevance and that the relevance is not
determined according to our criteria. Nevertheless, these reaction-
document pairs may provide useful supervision for ranking. We
used two different approaches to make use of the pairs, using the
same features mentioned above, focusing on the SVM-learning
methods based on the results of preliminary evaluation. The
ﬁrst approach (Pathway) is to train an SVM classiﬁer on the
pairs with pseudo-negative pairs randomly selected from the
pairs retrieved by PathText2. The second approach
(SVM + Pathway) is to train an SVM classiﬁer on the annotated
corpus with an additional feature, which denotes the prediction by
the SVM classiﬁer in the first approach (stacking).

3.3 Experimental setup

We divided the annotated corpus into training and test sets by
placing a randomly selected 80% of the reactions into the training
set and 20% into the test set. Ensuring that the reactions are kept
separate eliminates the risk of over-fitting of the algorithms to the
corpus. Table 3 presents some statistics regarding the split data.
The test set was not used during the development of the methods.

We evaluate ranking performance using the normalized dis-
counted cumulative gain (nDCG) metric (Jarvelin and
Kekalainen, 2002). This metric is commonly used for measuring
performance on graded relevance judgments where the gold
standard does not provide a strict total ordering of the data. It
also has the beneﬁt that it can compare the ranking performance
between queries, owing to it producing a ﬁxed range metric (with
values between 0.0 and 1.0), with larger values indicating better
performance.

Feature vectors were (L2-) normalized before applying the
machine-learning methods. The regularization parameter (C)

4 RESULTS

We initially evaluated the individual contribution of each seman-
tic search system on the training data by measuring the average
hit ratio of each system separately (Table 4). This evaluates the
ranking performance of each semantic search system on ﬁxed
document sets (i.e. system recall is not evaluated); documents
that were not retrieved by a semantic search system were as-
signed the lowest ranking. The results show that the semantic
search systems vary in their effectiveness, with MEDIE event
best matching the gold standard. These results were used to
deﬁne the ordering for the priority ranking heuristic (Section
3.2). We note that although some systems show similar overall
ranking performance, detailed analysis indicates substantial dif-
ferences in the document sets retrieved by the systems (see
Supplementary Material).

Table 5 shows the nDCG score of each ranking system. For the
machine-leaming methods, we found that the SVM method
achieved the best results, notably outperforming the average hit
ratio heuristic and BM25. RankSVM slightly outperformed the
average hit ratio method, but SVR did not. The results for SVR
are to be expected, as we treated relevance judgments as linearly
increasing absolute scores, which imposes considerable con-
straints on SVR. In contrast, SVM and RankSVM do not have
these constraints. The priority ranking heuristic shows competi-
tive performance on the test data, outperforming two of the ma-
chine-learning methods and showing a notable performance
improvement compared with the average hit ratio heuristic. For
machine-leaming methods, using the pairs curated in pathway
models, an SVM trained on the pairs (Pathway) performed as
well as RankSVM, and the pairs slightly improved performance
when used for creating an additional feature for training with
the data speciﬁcally annotated for ranking (SVM+Pathway).
These results demonstrate that existing pathway annotations can
be beneﬁcially combined with data annotated for the ranking task.

We note that the performance of the methods on the test data
appears somewhat lower than the results obtained for the

individual systems on the training data. However, comparison on
training and test data results conﬁrms that this is owing to differ-
ences between the two datasets; for example, the priority ranking
heuristic achieves a higher level of performance (0.865 nDCG)
than any single semantic search system on the training data
(Table 4). The results conﬁrm that it is effective to aggregate the
various semantic search systems and indicate that the systems
provide complementary information regarding document
relevance.

The priority ranking heuristic produced comparable results to
the SVM-based ranking on the test dataset. This indicates that
heuristic ranking informed by an analysis of the performance of
the semantic search methods remains competitive with machine
learning for the current training data size. To assess the degree to
which this result depends on the speciﬁc size of the training
dataset, we calculated a learning curve on the test dataset for
the SVM method (Fig. 4). We ﬁnd that the performance of the
SVM increases with the size of the training data up to the point
of using all of the available 360 training documents, and the
curve does not appear to have ﬂattened out up to this point.
This suggests that if given more annotated data, the SVM has
the potential to outperform the heuristics, which do not require
training and therefore do not beneﬁt from additional data. We
note also that we used a somewhat limited set of features, and
that there is potential for improved performance by incorporat-
ing more detailed query-result pair-speciﬁc features, such as de-
tailed information on how a query matches, or the rarity of the
query and matched reactions.

evaluations. PubMed provides keyword-based search and re-
turns documents in a reverse chronological ordering (Lu,
2011). We refer readers to the Supplementary Material for the
details of the evaluation setting. These results indicate that (i)
documents retrieved by PathText2 are more relevant than those
retrieved by querying PubMed; (ii) query expansion is effective in
retrieving relevant documents and (iii) priority ranking outper-
forms the average hit ratio heuristic.

In summary, our results show that the annotated corpus can
beneﬁt both the development of ranking based on heuristic rules
and the training of machine-learning methods. In addition, either
of these approaches could result in a substantial improvement in
the document ranking functionality in PathText 2, compared
with the average hit ratio heuristic.

5 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

Our evaluation of the performance of the machine-learning
system with respect to the training data size suggests that the
machine-learning methods could beneﬁt from additional data.
One idea is to gain feedback from users on the perceived quality
of the results while simultaneously increasing the amount of data
available for training the ranking component, as for our
SVM + Pathway model. This feedback might be gained by allow-
ing users to annotate documents with relevance annotations.
Additionally, there remain many opportunities for further
improvements to the feature representation of the SVM
method, which has the potential to allow for substantial increases
in ranking performance.

PathText2 relies on pathways being speciﬁed in SBML with
CellDesigner semantics. Although this representation is com-
monly used, it is not the only possible representation. One
possibility here is to generalize the support to include SBML
with alternative physical entity and reaction semantics, such as
Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) (Courtot et al., 2011), as well
as alternative pathway representations such as BioPAX (Demir
et al., 2010). This could be done using established mappings be-
tween different pathway model semantics (Strémback and
Lambrix, 2005) as well as automatic conversions such as that
between SBML and BioPAX (Mi et al., 2011). Such support
could further allow integration of PathText2 with numerous
domain tools such as Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011).

We finally note that there remain opportunities for improve-
ment of the semantic search systems themselves, in particular in
the text-mining algorithms to recognize entities and events.

6 CONCLUSION

We have presented PathText 2, an integrated search system de-
signed to link biological pathways with supporting knowledge in
the vast body of literature. This system allows direct access to the
most relevant documents from the literature, thus supporting
various tasks in the creation, verification, maintenance and ex-
tension of pathway models. The system implements SBML par-
sing, the conversion of reactions into system-speciﬁc queries,
query result combination and ranking by relevance to the
given pathway reaction using heuristic or machine learning-
based methods and an API supporting programmatic access to
the search functionality. A major focus of our efforts has been

the development of ranking functionality that combines the can-
didate document information retrieved by the various text
mining-based search systems into a list ordered in a way where
documents most likely to be relevant to the query reaction are
presented ﬁrst. We created a corpus of 450 judgments that iden-
tify on a four-point scale the relevance of documents to reactions
randomly selected from a set of four PANTHER DB pathways
and used it to evaluate simple ranking heuristics, advanced heur-
istics informed by evaluation of the training set and three ma-
chine learning-based ranking methods. Our results show that an
SVM-based ranking with annotations in pathway models can
notably outperform the simple ranking heuristics, achieving a
0.788 nDCG score. An online demonstration of the PathText2
system is accessible, and the annotated corpus is available for
research purposes from the project homepage (http://www.
nactem.ac.uk/pathtext2/). Access to the PathText2 API is avail-
able on request.

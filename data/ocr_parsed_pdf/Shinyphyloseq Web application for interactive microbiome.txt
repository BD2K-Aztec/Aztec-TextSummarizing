ABSTRACT

Summary: We have created a Shiny-based Web application, called
Shiny-phyloseq, for dynamic interaction with microbiome data that
runs on any modern Web browser and requires no programming,
increasing the accessibility and decreasing the entrance requirement
to using phyloseq and related R tools. Along with a data- and context-
aware dynamic interface for exploring the effects of parameter and
method choices, Shiny-phyloseq also records the complete user input
and subsequent graphical results of a user’s session, allowing the user
to archive, share and reproduce the sequence of steps that created
their result—without writing any new code themselves.

Availability and implementation: Shiny-phyloseq is implemented en-
tirely in the R language. It can be hosted/launched by any system with
R installed, including Windows, Mac OS and most Linux distributions.
Information technology administrators can also host Shiny-phyloseq
from a remote server, in which case users need only have a Web
browser installed. Shiny-phyloseq is provided free of charge under a
GPL—3 open-source license through GitHub at http://Joey711 .github.io/
shiny-phyloseq/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Analysis of microbial communities requires the interpretation of
one or more high-dimensional abundance matrices and its rela-
tionship with other datasets, using a complex and emerging suite
of methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate
statistics, Visualization and testing. Filtering, custom curation
and transformation of the abundance data are also required usu-
ally, but the precisely reproducible workﬁow from raw data to
ﬁnal analyses is often difficult or impossible to reproduce exactly.
Ideally, published scientific analyses are completely reproducible
in as easy a fashion as possible; and anything less represents an
impediment to both progress and peer review (Peng, 2011).
Fortunately, R is well suited for the analytical aspects of micro-
biome research, with an interaction-oriented functional program-
ming design (R Development Core Team, 2014) that includes
support for reproducible research (Allaire et al., 2014; Xie,
2014). We recently described a software package for the R lan-
guage, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation
and analysis of microbiome census data (McMurdie and
Holmes, 2013). One of the originally stated goals of phyloseq

was to leverage R-based resources for reproducible research,
and thereby, improve the reproducibility and portability of pub-
lished microbiome analyses. Unfortunately, for many micro-
biome researchers with classical training in biology, learning a
programming language%ven a functional interactive language
like Rihas proven to be a prohibitive investment of time and
effort. However, most of the necessary computations are not
only tractable by R, but also fast enough for dynamic interaction
Via a graphical user interface (GUI). Here we describe our release
of ‘Shiny-phyloseq’, a Web browser GUI that leverages phyloseq
and other R resources for the analysis of microbiome census
dataiwhile also allowing the user to archive the complete
code and data necessary to exactly reproduce their session re-
sults. Although it is difﬁcult for any single GUI application to
support the full range of analyses required in microbiome re-
search, Shiny-phyloseq provides a compelling framework and
introduction to microbiome analysis in R. Its modular open-
source design encourages modiﬁcation, customization and code
reuse.

There are other resources with GUI elements available for the
analysis of microbiome census data, including MG—RAST
(Meyer et al., 2008), QIIME (Caporaso et al., 2010) and
CloVR (Angiuoli et al., 2011). To our knowledge, there are no
GUIs available for the analysis of microbiome census data that
also leverage the R programming language, ggp10t2 (Wickham,
2009), and phyloseq while also providing a ‘provenance record’
of a user’s session.

2 METHODS

Shiny-phyloseq is almost entirely R code, but, like any Shiny app, can be
further customized/extended using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Shiny-
phyloseq is fully cross-platform and will launch locally from any R en-
vironment (Console R, Rgui, RStudio, etc). It can also be hosted by a
remote Web serverithis latter case only requires that the user has a
modern Web browser installed. Shiny-phyloseq leverages Shiny’s reactive
programming framework to compartmentalize and cache expensive com-
putational steps so that they are not recomputed unnecessarily during an
interactive session.

The current implementation of Shiny-phyloseq is dependent on many
important updates to the phyloseq package, including (i) an interface to
DESeq2 (Anders and Huber, 2010) for a negative Binomial method rec-
ommended by McMurdie and Holmes, 2014; (ii) a ggplot2-friendly data
organizing function, psmelt; (iii) the inclusion of low-level C code from
APE (Paradis et al., 2004) for ~100x faster UniFrac (Hamady et al.,
2009) distance calculations and tree plotting; (iv) faster network plot
function with better default settings, plot_net; and (v) additional op-
tions for ordering heatmaps by covariates.

Fig. 1. Shiny-phyloseq Network panel. The Shiny-phyloseq interface is
organized into panels from left to right, beginning with data selection,
ﬁltering/curation, transformation and then graphic-speciﬁc panels. The
user input widgets are consolidated in a left-hand sidebar of each panel.
The Select Dataset panel begins each session. Pre-loaded datasets are
available by default, and users can optionally specify public datasets
hosted on QIIME-DB (Caporaso et al., 2010), or upload private datasets
in biom (McDonald et al., 2012) or binary ‘.RData’ (phyloseq) formats.
The Filter panel supports user-deﬁned data filtering. Shiny-phyloseq pro-
vides a separate panel for each major graphic function in phyloseq,
including alpha diversity, sample- or OTU-networks, barplot, heatmap,
phylogenetic tree, ordination and scatterplot. All relevant panels support
customization of ﬁgure dimensions, color palette and download ﬁle
format

3 BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS

A typical workﬁow in Shiny-phyloseq begins with data upload
and selection, followed by optional filtering of Operational
Taxonomic Units (OTUs) or samples. A number of exploratory
data analysis methods are available in separate panels, including
alpha diversity estimates, multivariate ordination methods, as
well as network, heatmap, scatter and bar graphics. Some of
these methods depend on data transformations (e. g. regularized
log) or ecological distances (e. g. weighted UniFrac, Brainurtis),
which can be selected from a sidebar panel of parameter-input
widgets placed next to each graphic on each panel. Graphics can
be downloaded in a user-speciﬁed format by clicking the down-
load button at the bottom of each sidebar panel. Finally, a user
can download a compressed file containing the complete code
and data necessary to completely reproduce the steps that led to
their graphical result.

Shiny-phyloseq provides new features, including (i) a context-
and data-aware, browser-based interactive GUI application, (ii)
interactive 3D network graphics based on d3 . j s, for exploring
OTU or sample distance structure and (iii) provenance tracking
for reproducible sessions.

There are two network-graphic panels, both of which use new
functionality. The Network panel features the ability to animate
vertex connectedness as a change in the distance threshold,
and scales edge thickness according to inverse distance value.
The former feature can help a user to quickly scan the

dependency of the network on the choice of global threshold.
Alternatively, using the d3Network panel, networks can be inter-
actively explored by dragging and stretching nodes in a live 3D
network animation, with taxonomy or covariates mapped to
node color and/or mouse-over labels (Fig. 1). This D3
(Bostock et al., 2011) interactive graphic is a special phyloseq
implementation of the d3Network package (Gandrud, 2014).
The ﬁnal panel, Provenance, includes a button that (re)initiates
a special processing of the Shiny event log into reusable R code.
This record of parameter changes and analysis stepsiwhen
coupled with the complete workspace environment dataH30nsti-
tutes a so-called provenance record of the analysis session. Shiny-
phyloseq initiates a browser download of the compressed ﬁle
containing the code and data sufﬁcient to exactly reproduce
the series of graphics created in the session up to that point.
This can be archived or shared for batch re-execution in R.

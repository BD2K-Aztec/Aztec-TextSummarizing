ABSTRACT

Motivation: In silico prediction of site-specific kinase—substrate
relationships (ssKSRs) is crucial for deciphering phosphorylation net-
works by linking kinomes to phosphoproteomes. However, currently
available predictors for ssKSRs give rise to a large number of false-
positive results because they use only a short sequence stretch
around phosphosite as determinants of kinase specificity and do not
consider the biological context of kinase—substrate recognition.
Results: Based on the analysis of domain-specific kinase—substrate
relationships, we have constructed a domain-level phosphorylation
network that implicitly incorporates various contextual factors. It
reveals preferential phosphorylation of specific domains by certain
kinases. These novel correlations have been implemented in
PhosNetConstruct, an automated program for predicting target
kinases for a substrate protein. PhosNetConstruct distinguishes
cognate kinase—substrate pairs from a large number of non-cognate
combinations. Benchmarking on independent datasets using various
statistical measures demonstrates the superior performance of
PhosNetConstruct over ssKSR-based predictors.

1 INTRODUCTION

Phosphorylation of a variety of proteins by Ser/Thr or Tyr kinases
is one of the major post-translational modiﬁcations, which regu-
lates signal transduction events in different metabolic and disease-
related processes within a cell. Therefore, a detailed understanding
of protein phosphorylation networks is crucial for decoding the
molecular basis of various cellular processes. However, an expo-
nential increase in kinome information and identiﬁcation of var-
iety of phosphoproteins across different organisms (Bodenmiller
and Aebersold, 2011; Mok et al., 2010; Newman et al., 2013; Prisic
et al., 2010) has made complete experimental characterization of
phosphorylation networks enormously difﬁcult. Even though sev-
eral sequence as well as structure-based methods (Blom et al.,
2004; Kumar and Mohanty, 2010; Obenauer et al., 2003;
Saunders and Kobe, 2008; Xue et al., 2006, 2008) are available
for prediction of site-specific kinaseisubstrate relationships

(ssKSRs), they are ideally designed for identiﬁcation of phospho-
sites in a given substrate protein of a kinase. Hence, straightfor-
ward application of these methods to decipher phosphorylation
networks by prediction of kinases that can potentially phosphor-
ylate a given substrate protein can lead to the accumulation of
false-positive results. This is because every protein irrespective of
whether it is actually phosphorylated is treated as a putative sub-
strate. It is well known that approximately only one-third of the
entire proteome is phosphorylated (Cohen, 2000), and phosphor-
ylation events are part of dynamic and directional protein inter-
action networks.

The context-dependent factors that are likely to govern the kin-
aseisubstrate recognition process are cellular localization, coregu—
lation of interacting pairs of proteins and also the presence of
other docking/interacting domains in the same polypeptide or
coevolution of kinaseisubstrate pairs as interacting domains.
However, these contextual factors remain outside the purview of
the sequence motif-based methods for prediction of ssKSRs
owing to the consideration of small stretches of amino acids on
substrates as determinants of kinase speciﬁcity. Therefore, re-
cently developed approaches like NetworKIN (Linding et al.,
2007) and iGPS (Song et al., 2012) have combined motif /proﬁle—
based predictions with information about the functional associ-
ation between kinases and substrates derived from STRING
(Szklarczyk et al., 201 1) or other databases containing experimen-
tal proteiniprotein interaction (PPI) information. These
studies have demonstrated that inclusion of interaction context
leads to improved prediction of ssKSRs. However, direct infor-
mation about functional association or PPIs are only available for
a limited number of kinaseisubstrate pairs and hence it is neces-
sary to explore alternate approaches for prediction of phosphor-
ylation networks by inclusion of context-dependent interaction
probability for a kinaseisubstrate pair.

Several contextual factors are likely to better correlate with
sequence signatures at the globular domain level rather than sig-
natures in short sequence motifs. Domain-level sequence signa-
tures in polypeptide chains are assigned using Pfam (Finn et al.,
2010) or InterPro-type (Hunter et al., 2012) functional domain
deﬁnitions. These are derived from the HMM proﬁles obtained
from multiple sequence alignments of related proteins. In fact,
earlier studies by Sprinzak and Margalit (2001) have demon-
strated that, correlated InterPro domain-level sequence signa-
tures could be used as markers of PPIs. Liu and Tozeren
(2010). have also attempted to predict substrates of kinases
based on co-occurrence of pairs of interacting domains (Liu
and Tozeren, 2010). Therefore, in this study, we have constructed
a domain-level kinaseisubstrate network based on Pfam (Finn

Deciphering kinase-substrate relationships

 

et al., 2010) domain analysis of the experimentally identiﬁed
mammalian kinaseisubstrate pairs available in
PhosphoSitePlus (Hornbeck et al., 2012) and recently published
activity-based human phosphorylation network (Hu et al., 2014;
Newman et al., 2013). Systematic analysis of this kinaseiphos-
phodomain network has revealed novel patterns of preferential
phosphorylation of certain Pfam domains by speciﬁc kinases. We
also demonstrate that these preferential domain-speciﬁc kinasei
substrate relationships (dsKSRs) can be used to distinguish cog-
nate kinaseisubstrate pairs from all other non-cognate combin-
ations. Extensive benchmarking on a completely independent
test set indicates that by using dsKSRs, it is possible to predict
putative target kinases that are likely to phosphorylate given
substrate proteins.

2 METHODS

2.1 Clustering 0f kinases based on their domain phos-
phorylation proﬁles

Figure 1 shows various steps involved in the compilation of phosphoryl-
ation data and construction of an experimentally identiﬁed domain phos-
phorylation network. To have a signiﬁcant number of phosphorylation
events for each kinas&substrate pair in the dataset, kinas&substrate
pairs were selected from PhosphoSitePlus (Hornbeck et al., 2012) with
the criterion that each of the protein kinases had at least 20 substrate

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the protocol followed for compiling
the training dataset for kinasewlomain interactions. Pfam domain organ-
ization of polypeptides containing kinase domains and their substrate
proteins was analyzed for those kinases having a minimum of 20 distinct
substrate proteins. The cognate kinase—domain pairs obtained by this
approach were analyzed to understand dsKSRs and derive predictive
rules for identifying the putative target kinases for phosphoproteins
based on their domain organization

proteins. This resulted in 2642 substrate proteins phosphorylated by 61
different protein kinases. The domain compositions for each of these
substrate proteins and their target protein kinases were deciphered
using Pfam (Finn et al., 2010) functional domain deﬁnitions.
Phosphorylation sites on each of the 2642 substrate proteins were
mapped onto the corresponding Pfam functional domains resulting in
856 unique phosphodomains (Supplementary Data S1 and S2). Further
details are given in Supplementary Methods. Domain phosphorylation
proﬁles were represented by a binary matrix of dimension 61 x 856,
where each element consisted of 1 or 0 depending on whether a selected
domain is phosphorylated by a given kinase. The phosphorylation pat-
terns of interdomain linker stretches were also represented by a similar
matrix of dimensions 61 x 490. The distance between a pair of kinases in
terms of their domain phosphorylation proﬁles was computed using the
Jaccard coefﬁcient between domain phosphorylation vectors followed by
hierarchical clustering and the result was represented as a heat map using
the pheatmap module of R package (www.r-project.org).

2.2 Estimating relative preference of different kinases to
phosphorylate a given Pfam domain

The propensities of different kinases to phosphorylate different Pfam
domains were estimated based on the number of occurrences of a cognate
kinas&phosphodomain pair in our training dataset (Supplementary Data
S2) by using the protocol described in Supplementary Methods. In brief,
target signal P(Ki,Dj) for a given kinas&phosphodomain pair (Ki,Dj)
was computed as the probability of a domain Dj to be phosphorylated
in the substrates of kinase Ki. The background signal for this pair is the
probability of the same domain Dj being phosphorylated by all other
kinases (K’i). The ratio of target signal to background signal was called
the enrichment ratio (ER) for a given kinase—domain pair, i.e.
ER(Ki,Dj)=P(Ki,Dj)/P(K’i,Dj) (Supplementary Data S3). The ER
thus gives a quantitative measure of preferential phosphorylation of the
given domain by a speciﬁc kinase compared with all other kinases. For
each kinase, similar ERs were also computed for all other auxiliary do-
mains that occur on the same polypeptide as that of the substrates of
kinases irrespective of their phosphorylation status.

2.3 Benchmarking of PhosNetConstruct

PhosNetConstruct was benchmarked on two different test datasets that
were completely independent of the dataset used for training. The ﬁrst
test dataset was chosen carefully from PhosphoELM (Dinkel et al., 2010),
comprising substrate proteins for which target protein kinases were
known from published experimental studies. This will be referred as the
PhosphoELM test set. The second dataset was obtained from the recently
published activity-based high-resolution human phosphorylation map
(Hu et al., 2014; Newman et al., 2013), which became available after
completion of our work. This will be referred as the Newman test set.
All the substrates in these two datasets were selected with the criterion
that they contained one or more of the 856 domains analyzed in our
training dataset and one or more of the 61 protein kinases present in
our training dataset were known to phosphorylate these substrates.
However, the exact kinaseisubstrate pairs were not present in the training
set. Thus, they had not been used in the derivation of prediction rules and
hence constituted bona ﬁde independent datasets for testing the predictive
power of PhosNetConstruct. PhosphoELM test set consisted of 187 sub-
strate polypeptides, whereas the Newman test set consisted of 229 sub-
strate polypeptides. Each substrate protein from these test datasets was
analyzed to identify its constituent Pfam domains, and putative target
kinases were predicted based on the ER for each kinase—domain pair
above certain cutoff. The optimum value of the cutoff was selected
based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis
(Fawcett, 2006). Prediction performance was tested by using six statistical
parameters, namely, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, false positive rate (FPR),

positive prediction value (PPV), accuracy and Mathew’s correlation coef-
ﬁcient (MCC) as described in Supplementary Methods.

2.4 Comparison of the performance of PhosNetConstruct
with GPS, iGPS and NetPhosK

The performance of PhosNetConstruct was compared with GPS (Xue
et al., 2008), iGPS (Song et al., 2012) and NetPhosK (Blom et al., 2004),
which use motif/proﬁle or machine learning-based approaches to predict
the putative sites in a substrate protein that are likely to be phosphory-
lated by various kinases. Based on the sites predicted on these substrate
proteins for various kinases, kinase assignments were carried out for dif-
ferent Pfam domains in the substrate proteins. All those kinases for which
sites were predicted with a score above certain cutoff values by GPS,
iGPS and NetPhosK on a substrate protein were assigned as the pre-
dicted target kinases for that protein. For this purpose of comparison, a
set of nine kinase classes was selected, which can be predicted by all the
four methods, i.e. PhosNetConstruct, GPS, iGPS and NetPhosK
(Supplementary Data S1). Of the 187 substrate proteins in the
PhosphoELM test set, only 75 substrate proteins were known to be
phosphorylated by these nine kinases, namely, PKA, PKC, PKG,
CDK, CKl, CK2, EGFR, SRC and GSK. Therefore, these 75 substrate
proteins (Supplementary Data S4) were selected for benchmarking, and
performance of all four methods was compared in terms of the six stat-
istical parameters mentioned earlier. Of the 229 substrate polypeptides in
the Newman test set, 153 substrate proteins were known to be phosphory-
lated by 13 different kinase classes, namely, ABL, AKT, AUR, CaMK,
CDK, DYRK, GRK, GSK, JAK, MAPKAPK, PLK, SGK and SYK.
Because a large number of these kinases cannot be predicted by
NetPhosK, benchmarking on these 153 substrate proteins from the
Newman test set was carried out using PhosNetConstruct, GPS and
iGPS (Supplementary Data S5).

domain pairs (Fig. 1). Analysis of the Pfam domains phosphory-
lated by different kinase groups indicates that certain domains
are phosphorylated exclusively by certain kinase groups
(Supplementary Fig. S1). For example, 197 distinct Pfam do-
mains are phosphorylated exclusively by the AGC group of kin-
ases and not by any other group. A similar trend exists for all the
groups, although the number of Pfam domains exclusively phos-
phorylated by each kinase group varies.

3.1 Analysis of known phosphorylation network

Analysis of individual kinaseidomain pairs in the mammalian
phosphorylation network revealed that certain kinases phos-
phorylate a large number of Pfam domains, whereas other kin-
ases phosphorylate few domains (Fig. 2). For example, PKACoz
phosphorylates 175 distinct Pfam domains, whereas LKBl phos-
phorylates only ﬁve Pfam domains. Similarly, of the 856 Pfam
domains, only a small percentage of domains are phosphorylated
by a large number of protein kinases, whereas the majority of the
Pfam domains are phosphorylated by only six or fewer kinases
(Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). Thus, our analysis has led to
the identification of certain highly connected hub kinases
(Fig. 3a) and Pfam domains (Fig. 3b) in the protein phosphor-
ylation networks. Protein kinases like PKA, PKC, CDK, CK2
and Src are crucial in multiple cellular processes and signaling
pathways that are conserved within and across organisms.
Therefore, they phosphorylate many different functional do-
mains, which results in highly connected hubs in phosphoryl-
ation networks. Many different Pfam domains can potentially
harbor recognition motifs for the hub kinases that phosphorylate
them. However, it was intriguing how the hub Pfam domains
harbor recognition motifs for so many different kinases.
Therefore, we analyzed in detail the phosphorylation sites for
different kinases on each of these hub domains. Figure 4
shows five phosphosites in the P53_TAD domain that are phos-
phorylated by 18 different kinases. As can be seen, even though

that are phosphorylated are indicated with a lightening mark, and the kinases that phosphorylate these sites are shown within the boxes. Kinases for
which a substrate recognition motif (as compiled by NetPhorest) exists in the sequence stretch surrounding the site are underlined

th-
ese phosphosites on P53_TAD contain recognition motifs [as
defined by NetPhorest (Miller et al., 2008)] for only four kinases,
i.e. DNA-PK, p38-a1pha, CKl-A and CKl-D, they are phos-
phorylated by 14 other kinases despite absence of their cognate
recognition motifs. It is interesting to note that proline-directed
kinases like CDKs also phosphorylate non-proline sites on
P53_TAD (Lee et al., 2007). These results suggest that, apart
from the sequence motifs, other context-dependent features as
described earlier also play a signiﬁcant role in the kinaseesub-
strate recognition process.

To estimate the propensity of different kinases to phosphoryl-
ate different Pfam domains, we analyzed the number of occur-
rences of each kinaseephosphodomain pair in this network
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Supplementary Figure S5 shows the
number of occurrences of the kinaseephosphodomain pairs

and the total number of corresponding phosphosites for the
pKID domain to highlight the differential phosphorylation of
pKID by different kinases.

3.2 Classiﬁcation of kinases based on the domains they
phosphorylate

Supplementary Figure S6 shows the heat map depicting the clus-
tering of the 61 kinases based on their domain phosphorylation
profiles. Interestingly, the domain phosphorylation proﬁle-based
clustering closely resembles Manning’s sequence-based clustering
(Supplementary Fig. S7) of kinase catalytic domains in general
(Manning et al., 2002). It may be noted that no sequence infor-
mation of kinase catalytic domains has been used in domain
phosphorylation-based clustering. However, it uses substrate se-
quence information in the form of Pfam functional domain an-
notations. This result suggests that evolutionarily related kinases

N.P.Damle and D.Mohanty

 

have similar domain phosphorylation proﬁles. However, there
are subtle differences that seem to have interesting functional
implications. Unlike sequence-based clustering, in domain phos-
phorylation profile-based clustering, the AGC group of kinases
forms three distinct clusters. PKC isoformsiﬂ, 8, y and 87
phosphorylate a different set of Pfam domains than other PKC
isoformsig', 1.’ and 01. Similarly, the CMGC group has also split
into two different clusters. Such subtle alterations in the substrate
speciﬁcity of homologous kinases indicate the involvement of
certain kinaseesubstrate pairs in a speciﬁc biological context.
This contextual speciﬁcity of phosphorylation networks is not
apparent from the sequence-based classiﬁcation. Although the
current study takes into consideration only 61 kinases, the con-
servation patterns in specificity of domain phosphorylation by
different groups of protein kinases are likely to prevail even when
other kinases are included. Therefore, domain phosphorylation
patterns might help to construct protein phosphorylation net-
works in a more reﬁned way.

3.3 Estimating relative preference of different kinases to
phosphorylate a given Pfam domain

Analysis of kinasewlomain phosphorylation network and classi-
ﬁcation of kinases based on their domain phosphorylation pro-
ﬁles revealed that different kinases have distinct preferences to
phosphorylate certain Pfam domains with higher probabilities
than others. Therefore, we attempted to estimate the propensities
of different kinases to phosphorylate different Pfam domains
based on the number of occurrences of kinaseephosphodomain
pairs in our dataset. As mentioned in Section 2.2, we computed
ERs that give a quantitative measure of preferential phosphor-
ylation of a given domain by a speciﬁc kinase compared with all
other kinases. The value of ER would range from ER: 0 for a
non-cognate kinasewlomain pair to ER: 00 for those pairs
where a given kinase phosphorylates its cognate domain exclu-
sively and no other kinase phosphorylates that domain. In cases
where ER: 00, ER was assigned the value of 999 for conveni-
ence. Using this ER matrix, it will be possible to predict kinases
that are likely to phosphorylate a given Pfam domain.
Supplementary Figure S8 shows a heat map of ER values for
the 61 kinases and the top 24 hub domains in terms of loglo scale.
For example, of nine cognate kinases, PKCot phosphorylates the
Integrin_b_cyt domain with the highest probability and PDKl
with the least. Thus, an ER matrix consisting of 61 kinases and
856 phosphodomains was computed for all 52 216 possible kin-
asewlomain pairs. ERs were also obtained for all co—occurring
domains, and similar to phosphodomain enrichment, the ER
matrix was computed for 61 kinases and 2166 domains irrespect-
ive of their phosphorylation status. These results indicate that
potential target kinases for a phosphoprotein can also be
predicted based on the enrichment of phospho as well as co-
occurring auxiliary domains. It may be noted that, in contrast
to the phosphodomain enrichment that can predict domain-
speciﬁc phosphorylation, enrichment of co—occurring auxiliary
domains represents the phosphorylation preference of a complete
substrate protein within the domain as well as interdomain linker
regions. Because interdomain linker regions are also extensively
phosphorylated (Iakoucheva et al., 2004), we also analyzed the
phosphorylation patterns in these linker regions. As can be seen

from Supplementary Figure S9, a large number of protein kin-
ases phosphorylate only few linker regions, whereas a small set of
kinases phosphorylates a large number of interdomain linkers.
Interestingly, the kinases that phosphorylate the ﬂanking do-
mains also phosphorylate the intervening linker stretches.
Therefore, for prediction of phosphorylations on domain as
well as linker regions of a substrate protein, it might be appro-
priate to consider any domain enrichment, i.e. enrichment of
phosphodomains as well as co-occurring auxiliary domains.

3.4 Development of PhosNetConstruct server for predic-
tion of protein phosphorylation networks

We have developed an automated program PhosNetConstruct
for predicting kinases that are likely to phosphorylate a given
substrate protein. The results of our analysis of a kinaseephos-
phodomain network and the enrichment matrix derived from it
constitute the knowledge base for kinase predictions by
PhosNetConstruct. Given a FASTA sequence of a putative sub-
strate protein as input, PhosNetConstruct identiﬁes its Pfam
domain organization and then predicts target kinases for each
of its constituent Pfam domains based on the ERs for respective
kinaseephosphodomain pairs. For each of the predicted kinases,
PhosNetConstruct also allows Visualization of the experimentally
identiﬁed substrates, their constituent Pfam domains and sites of
phosphorylation. PhosNetConstruct also provides known PPI
networks of kinases based on the information from BioGRID
(Stark et al., 2006). The Visualization of the phosphorylation
networks is facilitated using WebCytoscape (Lopes et al.,
2010). It also provides information about 3D structures of inter-
acting domains by linking to 3DID (Stein et al., 2011).

3.5 Benchmarking of PhosNetConstruct

3.5.] Prediction of KSR using PhosNetConstruct, GPS, iGPS and
NetPhosK We wanted to compare the performance of
PhosNetConstruct, GPS, iGPS and NetPhosK by predicting
the target kinases for the 75 substrate proteins in
PhosphoELM test set. GPS 0(ue et al., 2008) and NetPhosK
(Blom et al., 2004) predict ssKSRs. iGPS (Song et al., 2012)
also predicts ssKSRs similar to GPS, but filters the predictions
by combining kinaseesubstrate interaction information from ex-
perimental PPI databases (Szklarczyk et al., 2011). This test set
consisted of 75 substrate proteins phosphorylated by nine differ-
ent kinases. Thus, 675 kinaseesubstrate pairs are possible, of
which only 86 are experimentally known cognate pairs, whereas
the remaining 589 constitute non-cognate combinations. We
wanted to investigate whether for each of these 75 substrate pro-
teins, these four prediction tools can correctly identify the cog-
nate kinases as true-positive (TP) results as well as non-cognate
kinases as true-negative (TN) results. Supplementary Figure S10
shows the results of prediction for a typical phosphoprotein con-
taining pKID and bZIP_1 Pfam domains, and kinases predicted
by each of the tools are listed as TP, FP, FN and TN values. A
similar prediction approach was followed for all 75 substrates
(Supplementary Data S4 and S6).

The thresholds or significance values for predictions by GPS,
iGPS and NetPhosK were chosen as per the optimum values
recommended by the respective developers. However, for

Deciphering kinase-substrate relationships

 

PhosNetConstruct, the threshold for ER was chosen based on
ROC analysis. As can be seen from Figure 5, the ROC
curves have a convex shape above the diagonal for the ER
values in the range of (L999. Increasing the ER cutoff reduces
the false-positive predictions. However, in our model, all the
kinasewlomain pairs that are absent in the training set are as-
signed an ER value of 0. Hence, an ER value of 0 implies that the
corresponding kinaseesubstrate pair will always be predicted by
PhosNetConstruct as negative. Hence, the ROC curves do not

of FPR and TPR at the ER cutoff of 0.2. Therefore, for com-
parison with other tools, predictions were carried out with an ER
cutoff of 0.2 (Table 1). For the purpose of comparison, predic-
tions by PhosNetConstruct were also carried out without any ER

cutoff, i.e. based on the presence or absence of a particular kin-
asewlomain pair. It is interesting to note that phosphodomain
enrichment without the ER ﬁlter achieves a TPR of 62.8% at an
FPR of 23%. However, when the ER filter is used along with
phosphodomain enrichment, the FPR reduces to 16.6%, but this
also lowers the TPR to ~59%. In contrast to the results of our
domain-based KSR prediction approach, the motif /proﬁle-based
ssKSR predictors GPS and NetPhosK give a much larger
number of false-positive predictions (Supplementary Table S1),
which results in FPRs of 66.38 and 71.82%, respectively. The
performance of iGPS is comparable with PhosNetConstruct with
relaxed enrichment criterion because of the inclusion of results
from PPI data. However, the speciﬁcity, TPP and accuracy for
PhosNetConstruct are better than iGPS, indicating its higher
efﬁciency at distinguishing cognate kinaseesubstrate pairs from
non-cognate combinations. Interestingly, any domain enrich-
ment with the ER filter has best performance among all seven
prediction approaches compared here, as it achieves a TPR of
81.4% at an FPR of 30.4%. It also has the highest accuracy and
MCC values. These results indicate that performance of
PhosNetConstruct is superior to ssKSR predictors like GPS,
NetPhosK and iGPS. The higher performance of any domain-
enrichment approach over phosphodomain enrichment suggests
that certain domains preferentially occur in substrates of speciﬁc
kinases, even if they are not phosphorylated. It is possible that
they mediate interactions between the substrate protein and the
proteins containing kinase domain by domainwlomain inter-
actions. In fact, Liu and Tozeren (2010) have also demonstrated
that kinaseesubstrate pairs can be predicted based on the enrich-
ment of co-occurring domains.

We also analyzed the performance of PhosNetConstruct, GPS
and iGPS on a Newman test set consisting of 153 substrates and
13 kinases (Supplementary Data S5 and S7). The results from
different predictors are shown in Table 2, and Supplementary
Figure S11 shows ROC curves for predictions by
PhosNetConstruct. Phosphodomain enrichment without ER cut-
off achieves a sensitivity of 37.1% and an FPR of 19.8%, which
are less than iGPS (48 and 22%, respectively). However, any
domain enrichment without ER cutoff achieves a sensitivity of
71.5% with an FPR of 37%. On the other hand, because of
increased false-positive results (Supplementary Table S2), GPS

shows a high FPR of 68.3%, although it achieves an increased
sensitivity of 86.4%. Thus, even on this larger test set,
PhosNetConstruct has higher speciﬁcity compared with other
ssKSR predictors. However, both PhosNetConstruct and iGPS
have lower sensitivities compared with their performance on the
PhosphoELM test set (Table 1), even though speciﬁcities and
TPP values are similar for both test sets. Detailed analysis re-
vealed that the reduced sensitivities arise from an increase in
false-negative predictions (Supplementary Table S2) in the
Newman test set. This is primarily because the Newman test
set consists of many novel kinaseephosphodomain pairs that
were absent in the training sets of both PhosNetConstruct as
well as iGPS. Therefore, we decided to include recently
released data from a high-resolution map of the human phos-
phorylation network (Newman et al., 2013) for training
PhosNetConstruct.

3.6 Performance of PhosNetConstruct using enhanced
training data

The activity-based human phosphorylation network has pro-
vided huge volumes of data on novel kinaseesubstrate pairs.
However, dsKSRs can only be derived for those pairs for
which phosphosite information is available. This high-resolution
human phosphorylation map consisted of 230 kinases and 648
substrates (Newman et al., 2013). However, there were only 21
kinases that had >20 substrates. To have signiﬁcant numbers of
kinaseephosphodomain pairs, only these 21 kinases and 391 sub-
strates phosphorylated by them were combined with our
PhosphoSitePlus training data, and ERs for preferential
domain phosphorylation were recalculated with an increased
number of kinases and substrates (Supplementary Data S8 and
S9). Many of the substrates in the high-resolution human phos-
phorylation map, though overlapped with earlier
PhosphoSitePlus training data, were found to be phosphorylated
by different kinases. Thus, our new training data consisted of 956
phosphodomains from 2851 distinct substrate polypeptides that
are known to be phosphorylated by 80 kinases. This resulted in
2361 kinaseephosphodomain pairs compared with 1861 kinasee
phosphodomain pairs in our older training set.

We selected 168 substrates from the PhosphoELM test set of
187 substrates by eliminating those that overlap with our new

compared the performance of PhosNetConstruct trained on

PhosphoSitePlus data for training (Supplementary Data S10

ried out at an individual kinase level, statistical parameters were
computed by merging closely related individual family members
into a single family, thereby giving rise to 30 kinase families as
highlighted in Supplementary Data S1. The ROC curves (Fig. 6)
indicate distinct improvement in performance on inclusion of
Newman’s data in our training set. Supplementary Tables S3

Deciphering kinase-substrate relationships

 

and S4 show performance of PhosNetConstruct in terms of six
statistical parameters mentioned earlier with an ER cutoff of 0.2
and without any ER ﬁlter. As can be seen from Figure 6 and
Supplementary Table S3, when PhosphoSitePlus data alone were
used for training and predictions were carried out using phos-
phodomain enrichment with an ER cutoff of 0.2, experimentally
known kinaseesubstrate pairs could be identiﬁed with a TPR of
56% at an FPR of 12%. On inclusion of high-resolution KSRs
in training data, the corresponding value of TPR increased to
66% at an FPR of 13%. Instead of phosphodomain enrichment,
if the criterion of any domain enrichment with ER ﬁlter is used,
PhosNetConstruct trained using enhanced data achieves a TPR
of 82% at an FPR of 25%. Thus, it can be seen that inclusion of
high-conﬁdence KSRs from Newman et al. (2013) is advanta-
geous in terms of prediction of dsKSRs. Currently,
PhosNetConstruct is the only program that covers so many dif-
ferent kinases and can still predict target kinases for substrate
proteins with such high sensitivity and speciﬁcity values. Thus,
our benchmarking on completely independent test sets indicates
that, using the dsKSRs derived in this work, it will be possible to
predict phosphorylation networks with reasonable accuracy.
After identifying kinaseesubstrate pairs using a dsKSR-based
approach implemented in PhosNetConstruct, in the next stage
individual phosphosites can be identified using ssKSR-based
methods like NetPhosK and GPS.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work, we have used experimentally identified kinasee
substrate pairs and their Pfam domain composition to analyze
dsKSRs and constructed a domain-based kinaseesubstrate inter-
action network. Experimentally identiﬁed phosphosites on
substrate proteins have been mapped onto Pfam domains or in-
terdomain linker regions. Interestingly, degree distribution of
kinases, as well as domains of this network, shows a power
law-type behavior, and our analysis reveals presence of a small
number of highly connected hub kinases and hub domains. This
suggests that only a few kinases can phosphorylate a large
number of Pfam domains, while most kinases phosphorylate
only a few Pfam domains and Vice versa. The differential speciﬁ-
cities of various kinases for different Pfam domains have been
quantiﬁed in the form of ER of kinasewlomain pairs. Our ana-
lysis of dsKSRs indicates that different Pfam domains are pref-
erentially phosphorylated by a limited number of speciﬁc kinases
only. Similarly, we have also computed ER values for kinasee
auxiliary domain pairs, which represent preference of a kinase to
phosphorylate a substrate protein because of enriched occur-
rences of the given auxiliary domain, even if the auxiliary
domain is not phosphorylated by the kinase.

Short sequence motif-based approaches for deciphering
ssKSRs have their origin in the use of peptide library data,
which obviously lacks contextual information. Hence, prediction
of phosphorylation networks based on ssKSRs results in a large
number of false-positive KSRs. On the other hand, dsKSRs
derived in this work implicitly incorporate various context-de-
pendent features. Second, Pfam domains are essentially longer
signature motifs, and thus they become more speciﬁc. This helps
in eliminating false-positive kinaseesubstrate pairs that arise in
ssKSR-based predictions. Therefore, we have incorporated these

dsKSRs into a web-based automated computational tool,
PhosNetConstruct, for genome-wide identiﬁcation of protein
phosphorylation networks.

Using these ER values, PhosNetConstruct distinguishes cog-
nate kinasewlomain pairs from a large number of non-cognate
combinations. Benchmarking on completely independent test
datasets indicates that performance of PhosNetConstruct is su-
perior to ssKSR-based predictors like GPS and NetPhosK.
However, iGPS that incorporates PPI information is the only
approach that attains a comparable trade-off between sensitivity
and speciﬁcity. Thus, our benchmarking results also suggest that
dsKSR derived by us has implicitly incorporated context-de-
pendent information, which methods like iGPS and
NetworKIN incorporate by including direct PPIs. Therefore,
our work demonstrates that even in cases where information
about PPI is not available, PhosNetConstruct can generate a
potential list of cognate kinaseesubstrate pairs by filtering out
a large number of non-cognate combinations and subsequently
exact phosphosites can be identiﬁed using ssKSR predictors like
GPS and NetPhosK.

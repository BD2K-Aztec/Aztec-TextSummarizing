Abstract

Motivation: To increase the signal resolution for large—scale meta—analyses of genome—wide associ—
ation studies, genotypes at unmeasured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are commonly
imputed using large multi—ethnic reference panels. However, the ever increasing size and ethnic di—
versity of both reference panels and cohorts makes genotype imputation computationally challeng—
ing for moderately sized computer clusters. Moreover, genotype imputation requires subject—level
genetic data, which unlike summary statistics provided by virtually all studies, is not publicly avail—
able. While there are much less demanding methods which avoid the genotype imputation step by
directly imputing SNP statistics, e.g. Directly lmputing summary STatistics (DIST) proposed by our
group, their implicit assumptions make them applicable only to ethnically homogeneous cohorts.
Results: To decrease computational and access requirements for the analysis of cosmopolitan co—
horts, we propose DISTMIX, which extends DIST capabilities to the analysis of mixed ethnicity co—
horts. The method uses a relevant reference panel to directly impute unmeasured SNP statistics
based only on statistics at measured SNPs and estimated/user—specified ethnic proportions.
Simulations show that the proposed method adequately controls the Type I error rates. The 1000
Genomes panel imputation of summary statistics from the ethnically diverse Psychiatric Genetic
Consortium Schizophrenia Phase 2 suggests that, when compared to genotype imputation methods,
DISTMIX offers comparable imputation accuracy for only a fraction of computational resources.

amples are publicly available at http://code.google.com/p/distmix.

unmeasured markers based on cosmopolitan reference panels (e.g.
1000 Genomes (1KG) (Altshuler et al., 2010)). While there have been
improvements (Delaneau et al., 2014; Howie et al., 2011; Liu et al.,
2013; O’Connell et al., 2014; Pasaniuc et al., 2010) in delivering more
accurate and reliable estimation in cosmopolitan cohorts, these
approaches still have two major limitations. The first is the computa—
tional burden—they are computationally very demanding due to i)
their requirement of estimating haplotypes (pre—phasing) of all sub—
jects in the study and ii) the use of large and diverse panels. For large
consortium meta—analyses [e.g. Psychiatric Genetic Consortium
Schizophrenia Phase 2 (PGC SCZ2) (Ripke et al., 2014) and Genetic
Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (Allen et al., 2010)], (multiple
iterations of) genotype imputation can be extremely burdensome com—
putationally. The second limitation is the requirement for individual—
level genotype data. Unlike freely available summary statistics, there is
a limited (or, at least, not timely) access to genotypic data that is
required by genotype imputation methods. This, in turn, might slow
the process of scientific discovery.

To overcome the above mentioned limitations associated with
genotype imputation methods, recently two summary statistics
based imputation methods, DIST (Lee et al., 2013) (developed by
our group) and ImpG (Pasaniuc et al., 2014), have been proposed.
Both methods can directly impute summary statistics (two—tailed Z—
scores) for unmeasured SNPs from genome—Wide association studies
(GWASs) consisting of both family and independent cohorts. The
methods were shown to (i) substantially reduce the computational
burden and (ii) be practically as accurate as commonly used geno—
type imputation methods. These methods were successfully applied
in gene—level joint testing of functional variants using only summary
data (Lee et al., 2015) and functional enrichment analyses (Pickrell,
2014). However, in their present form, direct imputation methods
are only amenable for imputation in ethnically homogeneous
cohorts.

To extend methods like DIST to cosmopolitan cohorts additional
study information might be needed, e.g. as described in Methods,
cohort allele frequencies (AFs). However, it is possible to determine
Whether an individual subject is a study member by using only the
subject’s genotypes and in—cohort study AFs (Homer et al., 2008).
Based on this finding, to protect privacy, funding agencies, besides
genotypic data, also restricted public access to GWAS AFs.
However, subsequently, it was shown (Visscher and Hill, 2009) that
the power of the subject identification is roughly proportional to the
ratio of the number of independent loci to the number of subjects in
a study cohort. Their simulations showed that even for the smaller
GWAS/meta—analyses with 10 000 subjects, the detection power falls
below 0.5. Even more, all these calculations assume homogeneous
populations. For mixed ethnicity cohorts the population stratifica—
tion encompassed in AFs estimates further confounds the subject
identification. Thus, for a large cosmopolitan meta—analysis, e.g.
PGC SCZ2 (>80 000 subjects), the identification power is practic—
ally negligible. Thus, for the ever increasing sizes and ethnic diver—
sities of genetic meta—analyses, the restrictions on AF can be lifted
without harming subject privacy.

In this article, we extend DIST imputation method/software to
Directly lmputing summary STatistics for unmeasured SNPs from
MIXed ethnicity cohorts (DISTMIX). DISTMIX inherits the main
advantages of DIST, i.e. speed, not requiring genetic data access and
applicability to pedigree data, While gaining the capability to accur—
ately impute association summary statistics from multi—ethnic
studies.

This is achieved by (i) predicting a study’s proportions
(weights) of ethnicities from a multi—ethnic reference panel based

only on (common) Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) AFs
from the studied cohort or taking, as the weights, user—specified
ethnic proportions drawn from one’s prior information on ethnic
composition of the study samples, (ii) computing ethnicity—
Weighted correlation matrix based on the estimated/user—speci—
fied weights and genotypes of ethnicities from the reference panel
and then (iii) using the Weighted correlation matrix in a DIST
procedure.

2 Methods
2.1 DISTMIX imputation

Assume that the reference panel consists of N ethnic groups and that
the vector G for individual genotypes in the study cohort is a mix—
ture of random genotypes from (not admixed from) the N ethnic
groups with weight vector W : [uh-IN“. The genotype vector G
then follows a mixture distribution p(G) : EgilwiﬂGIi), Where
p(GIi) is the genotype distribution of the ith ethnic group, assumed
to have genotype mean u,- and variance—covariance matrix C,. By the
law of total expectation and total variancejcovariance, the uncondi—
tional expectation and variance—covariance matrix of G can be

derived as
u : E(G) : Egilwiu, (1)
and
c : Cot/(G) : aime- + zziwkii, — moi,- — W (2)
respectively.

Let S be the vector of the ‘estimated study population’ SNP refer—
ence allele frequencies (RAFs), e.g. the weighted mean of case and
control frequencies using the studied condition prevalence and its
complement as weights, respectively. Let P : [PijlxN be the RAF
matrix of the reference population ethnicities for the measured
SNPs, Where P,- is the RAF vector of the ith ethnicity of the reference
panel. By dividing Equation (1) by a factor of 2, the study cohort
RAF vector can be expressed as a weighted sum of RAF vectors of
reference population ethnicities with W : [uh-IN“: S : ELM-P,
After straightforward algebraic manipulations:

C011 P,S : Cov(P,Ez: wiPi) : Cov(P,PW) : Cov(P)W.
z 1

Linear/quadratic programming methods can be employed to esti—
mate W subject to constraints 2,2190,- : 1 and 0944-31. However,
due to the large number of SNPs, even simply solving the linear sys—
tem Without constraints (W : Cov(P)_1C01/(P,S)) and substituting
zero for the (very) few small negative proportions, can yield very ac—
curate results Which practically meet the weight constraints. Not
using the linear/quadratic programming might even yield advantages
when the reference panel does not provide good proxies for all eth—
nic groups in the cohort. Under such a scenario, after setting to zero
negative weights, the sum of the resulting weights is likely to exceed
one. In turn, this acts as an extra ridge penalty for the correlation
matrix (see 3 paragraphs below), which help control DISTMIX false
positive rates.

Due to the strong LD among SNPs, the calculation of the correl—
ation using all SNPs in a genome might lead to a poor estimation.
To avoid this, we sequentially split GWAS SNPs into 1000 non—
overlapping SNP sets, e.g. first set consists of the 1st, 1001st,
2001st, etc. map ordered SNPs in the study. The large distances be—
tween SNPs in the same set, makes them quasi—independent which,
thus, improves the accuracy of the estimated correlation. W is

subsequently estimated as the average of the weights obtained from
the 1000 SNP sets.

Typically, the study AF information is not publicly accessible.
Thus, to make DISTMIX applicable even to summary data sets lack—
ing AF information, we added an option for users to pre—specify the
weights based on their prior knowledge on ethnic composition of
the study cohort of interest. This option should be most useful when
(i) fairly accurate proportion information about ethnicities involved
in the cohort is available and (ii) all ethnicities in the cohort have
reasonably close proxies in the reference panels.

Based on estimated/pre—specified weights W : le, we esti—
mate the cohort genotype correlation matrix 2 in a three step pro—
cess. First, by using Equation (2), estimate the cohort genotype
covariance matrix C in the sliding Window as

C : ZELMA/id + RENE-(ii,- — r1)(r1i- WT

Where [1,- and C,- are the estimated genotype mean (twice the RAF)
vector and variance—covariance matrix for the ith ethnic group re—
spectively and [i is the estimated cohort genotype mean vector com—
puted as ZELMA/#1,. Second, normalize C to obtain the correlation
matrix, 2, by dividing each covariance by the product of the corres—
ponding SNP genotype standard deviations. Third, to avoid false
positive when cohort and panel ethnicities are not well matched
(and, thus, weights might not sum to one), add a ridge adjustment
by multiplying the diagonal elements of 2 with
max (BELLE, Hallie».

To avoid ill—conditioned mixture correlation matrix due to the
highly correlated LD structure, we add a second ridge adjustment,
heuristically set to A : 2 / ﬂ (Where n is the sample size of the refer—
ence population), to the diagonal elements of 2 (Lee et al., 2015;
Pasaniuc et al., 2014; Pickrell, 2014). 2 is subsequently used to im—
pute two—tailed Z—scores of unmeasured SNPs using the conditional
expectation formula for multivariate normal variates (Lee et al.,
2013). To obtain Z—scores, DISTMIX uses the square root of the im—
putation information to normalize (to a variance of one) the condi—
tional expectations (Lee et al., 2015; Pasaniuc et al., 2014).

2.2 Assessment of the type I error rate of DISTMIX

To assess the Type I error rate and the accuracy of ethnicity weight
estimation for the proposed method, we simulated, under the null
hypothesis of no association (H0), five sets of 100 summary data sets
of Ilumina 1 M autosomal SNPs from five different ethnicity com—
binations in 1KG: (i) 40% ASW+ 60% GBR (Cohort 1), (ii) 60%
CHB+40% MXL (Cohort 2), (iii) 20% ASW+30% CHB+30%
GBR+20% MXL (Cohort 3), (iv) 30% CEU+25% CHS+5%
PUR + 40% YRI (Cohort 4) and (V) 10% ASW + 15% CEU+ 15%
CHB + 12.5% CHS + 15% GBR+ 10% MXL + 2.5% PUR+ 20%
YRI (Cohort 5) (See Supplementary Table S1 for abbreviations for
ethnicities in 1KG and Section 1 in Supplementary Data for null
summary data set simulations).

Using DISTMIX at its default settings (Supplementary Table S2)
and 1KG (phase 1 release version 3 with 1092 subjects and minor
AF (MAF) 20.5%), we imputed each null GWAS summary data
from Cohorts 1—4. For summary data from Cohort 5, we only esti—
mated ethnicity proportions. To assess the robustness of DISTMIX
when the reference panel does not incorporate best—matching ethnic—
ities, we also imputed simulated data sets from Cohort 3 using a
subset of 1KG reference panel which excluded the relevant ethnic—
ities (GBR and MXL). Based the DISTMIX H0 results, we estimated
empirical Type I error rates across different nominal levels.

2.3 Comparison with genotype imputation method

We compared the performance of DISTMIX and the commonly
used IMPUTE2/SHAPEIT (Delaneau et al., 2012; Howie et al.,
2009) using all the 9 million autosomal SNPs summary statistics re—
ported for PGC SCZ2 discovery phase (Ripke et al., 2014), i.e.
IMPUTE2 imputation information score 2 0.6 and MAF Z 1%. (We
note that the filtering cutoff (0.6) on IMPUTE2 imputation informa—
tion used in PGC SCZ2 discovery phase is slightly higher than the
ones used in other studies.) From the combined discovery—replication
analysis, PGC SCZ2 identified 105 autosomal LD independent asso—
ciation regions, defined as the regions containing all SNPs in LD
(r2 > 0.6) with the PGC SCZ2 top SNPs. For a conservative com—
parison, from these 9 million SNPs, we first deemed as ‘measured’
675K autosomal SNPs (hereafter referred to as PGC SCZ2 1M)
consisting only of Ilumina 1 M SNPs with information scores 2 0.95.
On the basis of summary statistics for these 675 K SNPs, we re—
imputed the remaining SNPs using DISTMIX at its default settings
with the 1KG reference panel. To demonstrate the advantage of
DISTMIX’s weighting approach over simple selection of reference
populations, we re—imputed the PGC SCZ2 1 M SNPs using DIST at
the same default settings with two continental reference (European
(EUR) and Asian (ASN)) populations from 1KG. Subsequently, both
DISTMIX and DIST results were compared to PGC SCZ2 data. For
both sets of results, we do not apply any post—imputation filtering
based on imputation quality.

3 Results

3.1 Simulated data underthe null hypothesis

Under the null hypothesis of no association, DISTMIX delivers ac—
curate and reliable estimates for the weights of ethnicities from 1KG
reference panel (Table 1). Mean values of the 100 estimated weight
sets for all 5 simulated cohorts are very close to actual values. Even
more, the accuracy of the weight estimates is remarkable, the stand—
ard deviation (SD) for any of these estimates falling below 0.2%.
The increased complexity of cohort (Cohorts 3—5 in Table 1) does
not diminish the estimation accuracy. When no perfectly matched
ethnicities exist in the reference population, the weight of next clos—
est ethnicities is increased (Cohort 3" in Table 1 ).

DISTMIX controls the Type I error rate at or below the nominal
level for all simulated cohorts (Fig. 1). While some increase in the
Type I error rates was observed when excluding two best—matching
ethnicities from the reference population (Cohort 3") (compared to
Cohort 3 which used the reference panel containing all best—match—
ing ethnicities), DISTMIX still maintains the Type I errors at or
below the nominal level (Fig. 1).

3.2 Comparison with IMPUTE2 using PGC SCZ2 data
The estimated weights of 1KG ethnicities for PGC SCZ 1 M are also
realistic (last row of Table 1). The estimated proportions for
European (25.2% for CEU; 17.9% for FIN; 24.3% for GBR; 2.4%
for IBS; 15.4% for TSI) and Asian cohorts (0.5% for JPT; 2.1% for
CHB; 4% for CHS) are close to the actual proportion of European
(~91%) and Asian cohort subjects (~%1 for Japan; ~5% for
Chinese ancestry (Singapore and China) in PGC SCZ2. Small non—
zero weights for ASW, CLM and PUR might capture some of the
European background from these heavily admixed American
populations.

The imputed DISTMIX and IMPUTE2 statistics for PGC SCZ2
discovery phase behave quite similarly (Fig. 2 and Supplementary
Fig. S1). The analysis of 7425 593 markers imputed by DISTMIX

two predictions increases to 99.5%. (When compared to DISTMIX,
DIST using EUR+ASN as a reference population performed poorly
(Supplementary Fig. S2): r2 between DIST and IMPUTE2 Z—scores
was 79.4% for all SNPs and 98.1% for suggestive signals. This re—

1045/1916 SNPs with significant/suggestive association signals for
DISTMIX but not for IMPUTE2, 1010/1564 (96.7%/81.6%) SNPs
are from in or near the association locus and 398/445 SNPs are from
the MHC region.

For a more detailed performance assessment, we also compared
the top p—values of DISTMIX and IMPUTE2 for the 105 significant
autosomal association regions reported by PGC SCZ2 (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Table S3). While IMPUTE2 applied to PGC SCZ2
discovery phase identified 88 (83.8%) statistically significant regions
out of these 105 regions, DISTMIX successfully detected 81
(77.1%) as significant, including two regions not identified by
IMPUTE2. However, the regions not detected by just one of the two
methods yielded, for the smaller signal, p—values just below the sig—
nificance threshold (Fig. 3). When compared to IMPUTE2, most of
the apparent conservativeness of DISTMIX is likely due to the LD
estimation using the ridge penalty (2 : 2 / ﬂ) for the small 1KG ref—
erence panel used for imputation. We expect this difference to be—
come negligible when using the very large next generation reference
panels. (Note that the difference in signal detection is not technically
a power loss for DISTMIX, since we compare the results of each im—
putation method with PGC2 IMPUTE2 signals and not with the
true signals.)

On a Linux cluster with 24 computation nodes, each having 4x
Intel Xeon 6 core 2.67 Ghz processor and 64 GB of RAM, the im—
putation of PGC SCZ2 1 M was performed in parallel using 40 cores
(one core per autosome chromosome arm). The running time and
peak memory usage were slightly under 12 hours and 1 GB, respect—
ively. Remarkably, the running time translates to a single core com—
putation time of less than one week.

4 Conclusions

DIST and ImpG assume that the genotypes and association statistics
have identical correlation structures. However, While the assump—
tion is reasonable for homogeneous cohorts, it might not be met
when there are relevant covariates which confound genotypes, e.g.
ancestry principal components in ethnically mixed studies. To ad—
equately analyze such cohorts, we propose DISTMIX, a very fast
and novel method/software for directly imputing summary statistics
of untyped makers from cosmopolitan cohorts Without using sub—
ject—level genotype data. The proposed method (i) uses mixture pro—
portions for each ethnicity in a reference panel (e.g. 1KG) either (a)
provided by the user or (b) estimated based on the in—cohort esti—
mated AFs of common variants, (ii) uses these proportions to deter—
mine the cohort LD as a mixture of the LDs of the ethnicities from
the reference panel and (iii) uses the mixture LD in DIST procedure
to impute statistics at untyped variants.

As shown by our simulation and empirical studies, for cosmopol—
itan cohorts, DISTMIX (i) accurately estimates in—study weights of
ethnicities from a reference panel (when they are not provided by
the user), (ii) maintains the Type I error rate at or below the nominal
level, (iii) delivers comparable imputation accuracy to commonly
used genotype imputation methods While (iv) dramatically reducing
computational needs. Moreover, given that the relatedness between
subjects in a cohort does not affect the estimated mixture LD,
DISTMIX can be used ‘as—is’ for meta—analyses containing family
data.

Compared to summary statistics based imputation methods like
DISTMIX, genotype imputation methods offer more ﬂexibility to
researchers; once haplotype phasing and genotype imputation are
done for a sample cohort, researchers can conduct different GWASs
using different phenotypes and covariates Without re—imputation.
While the current DISTMIX version imputes only one set of sum—
mary values, given that the most computer intensive part is the esti—
mation of the correlation matrix, we believe that a future version
simultaneously imputing Z—score for multiple traits is attainable
with minimal effort.

Due to the emergence of very large reference populations such as
the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) including more than
30000 subjects at over 50 million SNPs (Kretzschmar et al., 2014)
(httpz//www.haplotype—reference—consortium.org), imputation pro—
cedures will be required to both impute new studies and re—impute
previously published GWASs. This process will require a sudden in—
crease in processing capabilities due to these larger panel sizes. For
example, even after an impressive ~20>< speed improvement, the
genotype imputation using the HRC panel, will still be around 2
times slower than the same imputation using present methods with
the 1KG panel (Fuchsberger et al., 2014). At these reference panel
sizes, DISTMIX will also have much longer running times. Given
that the most computer intensive part of DISTMIX imputation is
the reference panel—based computation of the correlation matrix, in
future DISTMIX versions we plan to pre—compute, and store in a
database, the local correlation matrix of genetic regions by each eth—
nic group (Pasaniuc et al., 2014). Thus, DISTMIX using the pre—
computed LD matrices will dramatically reduce the running time
associated with future large reference panels. Moreover, such an ap—
proach has the added advantage of making the computational bur—
den of summary statistic imputation practically invariant to the
sample size of the reference panel. This invariability will be a useful
feature with the likely increase in study sizes.

When compared to genotype imputation methods e.g. IMPUTE2
and MACH (Li et al., 2010), due to its sample size dependent ridge
estimate (2 : 2N5), DISTMIX might deliver somewhat conserva—
tive results for the rather small existing panels, such as 1KG used in
our paper (Fig. 3). (Its conservativeness is likely to be more pro—
nounced at lower imputation information). However, the ridge esti—
mate, and thus conservativeness, will be greatly diminished soon, as
the size of reference panels is increased by almost two orders of mag—
nitude (see the HRC panel above). To reduce the computational run—
time and the complexity of our implementation, DISTMIX is
written in C++ with open—source libraries and publicly available
online.

Abstract

Motivation: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a superfamily of enzymes responsible for the metabolism of
drugs, xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. CYP2D6 metabolizes about 30% of drugs and pre—
dicting potential CYP2D6 inhibition is important in early—stage drug discovery.

Results: We developed an original in silico approach for the prediction of CYP2D6 inhibition com—
bining the knowledge of the protein structure and its dynamic behavior in response to the binding
of various ligands and machine learning modeling. This approach includes structural information
for CYP2D6 based on the available crystal structures and molecular dynamic simulations (MD) that
we performed to take into account conformational changes of the binding site. We performed mod—
eling using three learning algorithms —support vector machine, RandomForest and NaiveBayesian
—and we constructed combined models based on topological information of known CYP2D6 inhibi—
tors and predicted binding energies computed by docking on both X—ray and MD protein conforma—
tions. In addition, we identified three MD—derived structures that are capable all together to better
discriminate inhibitors and non—inhibitors compared with individual CYP2D6 conformations, thus
ensuring complementary ligand profiles. Inhibition models based on classical molecular descrip—
tors and predicted binding energies were able to predict CYP2D6 inhibition with an accuracy of
78% on the training set and 75% on the external validation set.

1 Introduction

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) is a superfamily of enzymes responsible for
the metabolism of drugs, xenobiotic substances and endogenous
compounds (Johansson and Ingelman—Sundberg, 2011; Shimada,
2006; Singh et (11., 2011). It has been estimated that about 75% of
the marketed drugs are metabolized by CYPs, the major CYP iso—
forms being 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 3A4 (Singh et (11.,
2011). These enzymes detoxify the organism from various xeno—
biotics and activate some prodrugs by oxidation. Yet, oxidation
sometimes leads to metabolites that are more active than the admin—
istrated drugs or activates pro—carcinogens by creating highly react—
ive metabolite species. Inhibition of CYP is a complex process
because it can correspond to a competitive inhibition in the active
site, a modification of the substrate or metabolite ﬂux between the
active site and outside of the enzyme or an inhibition by a drug itself
or by its metabolites (time—dependent inhibition) leading then to ad—
verse drug—drug interactions (Bode, 2010; Johansson and Ingelman—
Sundberg, 2011; Rodriguez—Antona and Ingelman—Sundberg, 2006;
Singh et (11., 2011). Thus, predicting potential CYP inhibition is im—
portant in early—stage drug discovery. CYP2D6 metabolizes about
30% of drugs although it represents only 2% of hepatic CYPs
(Singh et (11., 2011). Besides liver, intestine and kidney, CYP2D6 is
also expressed in brain cells where it may be involved in metabolism
of neurotransmitters such as serotonin (Ferguson and Tyndale,
2011). CYP2D6 interacts with many drugs used for regulation of
the central nervous system (psychotropics) or the cardiovascular sys—
tem (anti—rhythmic drugs) (Marechal et (11., 2008; Rowland et (11.,
2006). This isoform is of particular interest as a large amount of
drugs can be metabolized only by CYP2D6 (Singh et (11., 2011).
Moreover, CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic (Ingelman—Sundberg
et (11., 2007; Martiny and Miteva, 2013) with more than a hundred
of allelic variants (Sim and Ingelman—Sundberg, 2010) leading to
poor, intermediate, extensive or ultra—rapid metabolism that can
render the administrated drug toxic or inefficient (Johansson and
Ingelman—Sundberg, 2011; Pinto and Dolan, 2011; Porcelli et (11.,
2011; Rodriguez—Antona and Ingelman—Sundberg, 2006).

A number of modeling studies have been undertaken to under—
stand the molecular basis of CYP2D6—drug interactions and
CYP2D6—related metabolism or inhibition (Ai et (11., 2015; Cruciani
et (11., 2005; de Graaf et (11., 2006; Kemp et (11., 2004; Kirchmair
et (11., 2012; Kjellander et (11., 2007; Livezey et (11., 2012; Marechal
et (11., 2008; Martinez—Sanz et (11., 2013; Moroy et (11., 2012; Stoll
et (11., 2011; Tyzack et (11., 2013). Most of these analyses have been
executed on homology models as the first X—ray structure of human
CYP2D6 was solved in 2006 (Rowland et (11., 2006). CYP inhibition
is considered to be more difficult to predict than sites of metabolism
(SOM) due to the lack of reactive sites (Stoll et (11., 2011). Recently,
a new approach for prediction of CYP inhibition, Cprules, using
decision tree algorithm based on compound structural rules has
been reported (Shao et (11., 2015). However, the extensive ﬂexibility
of the CYP2D6 structure, which represents its natural mechanism to
accommodate diverse ligands into the active site (Moroy et (11.,
2012; Wang et (11., 2015), can strongly affect the prediction of CYP
inhibition when one uses traditional ligand—based Quantitative
Structure—Property Relationships (QSAR) modeling (Branden et (11.,
2014; Stoll et (11., 2011). Indeed, in 2010, Vedani and co—authors

(Rossato et (11., 2010) adopted a mixed—model protocol in which lig—
and—based pre—alignment was followed by ligand docking to the
CYP2D6 protein structure with ﬂexible side chains which allowed a
quantification of ligand binding through multi—dimensional QSAR
modeling validated on 56 CYP2D6 binders.

The recently reported CYP2D6 structures in complex with dif—
ferent inhibitors (Wang et (11., 2012a, b, 2015) as well as the large
number of experimentally validated CYP2D6 binders available in
the PubChem BioAssay database (Wang et (11., 2012a, b) permit to
carry out a comprehensive analysis of CYP2D6 inhibition. In this
study, we developed a new integrated in silico approach to predict
inhibition of CYP2D6. The performed molecular dynamic simula—
tions (MD) provided new insights about the conformational changes
in the active site architecture of CYP due to the accommodation of
different ligands. We found a set of modeled CYP2D6 conform—
ations, which all together are able to correctly retrieve, after dock—
ing, 70% of the known CYP binders in 35% of the screened
compound library. The computational protocol integrating docking
into this pool and machine learning—based modeling can be success—
fully applied to predict CYP2D6 inhibitors with 75 % of success.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Molecular dynamics simulations of CYP2D6

Among the X—ray structures of human CYP2D6 available at the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Bernstein et (11., 1977), we retained the
only apo X—ray structure PDB ID 2F9Q (Rowland et (11., 2006) and
one holo structure co—crystallized with prinomastat (a metallopro—
tease inhibitor and a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 with an observed
Ki: 0.049 uM; Wang et (11., 2012a, b), PDB ID 3QM4 (Wang et (11.,
2012a, b), as the other available holo X—ray structures shared very
similar conformations with no striking differences in the binding
sites [all atom root mean square deviation (RMSD) <1A for the
PDB IDs: 3QM4, 3TDA, 4WNT, 4WNU, 4WNV, 4WNW, 3TBG].
The apo structure of CYP2D6 PDB ID 2F9Q misses a loop of 10
residues from position 42 to 51. This loop has been built using
MODELLER 9.7 (Sali et (11., 1995) by generating 100 models and
selecting those of lower discrete optimized protein energy score.
Residues D230, R231 and M374 are mutated in the X—ray structure
and have been replaced by the wild type (WT) residues L230, L231
and V374, respectively, using MODELLER 9.7. These rebuilt apo
X—ray structure and the holo X—ray structure were then used for es—
tablishing our protocol.

Molecular dynamic simulations using CHARMM c35b1 version
(Brooks et (11., 1983) have been performed in order to explore the
binding site ﬂexibility of the two structures. We used the all—atom
PARAM27 force field (Mackerell et (11., 2004). The pKa values of
the titratable groups were calculated with the Finite Difference
Poisson Boltzmann approach using the web server tool Protein
Continuum Electrostatics (Miteva et (11., 2005) (dielectric values of
11 and 80 for solute and solvent, respectively). We ran 3 MD simu—
lations in complex with the substrates of CYP2D6 propafenone,
mexiletine and codeine (Fig. 1) because these drugs have very differ—
ent chemical structures as compared with the already co—crystalized
CYP2D6 inhibitors, and as such those simulations should allow to
explore more thoroughly the conformational space of the CYP2D6

CODEINE PHOFAFENONE MEXILETINE

Fig. 1. Structures of substrates of CYP2D6 used for MD simulations. The
arrows show the main sites of metabolism

active site. To generate the starting ligand conformations, we carried
out preliminary docking experiments with AutoDock 4.2 (Morris
et (11., 2009) and Vina 1.1.1 (Trott and Olson, 2010) using the holo
X—ray structure of the enzyme and after investigating the proton—
ation state of the ligands with MarvinSketch version 5.3 (2010,
ChemAxon). The best substrate conformations showing the lowest
binding energies with known SOM (Fig. 1) close to the heme Fe
(<6 A) have been chosen as starting conformations for MD simula—
tions. Based on the apo X—ray structure of CYP2D6, we performed
four MD simulations: one apo, one in complex with propafenone,
one in complex with mexiletine and one in complex with codeine.
We also performed two MD simulations based on the holo X—ray
structure: one with its co—crystallized ligand and one without bound
ligand. Topology and parameters of all the ligands were assigned by
using the CgenFF program (Vanommeslaeghe et (11., 2012). The
solvation was taken into account by the Generalized Born implicit
solvent function FACTS (Haberthiir and Caflisch, 2008). Non—
bonded interactions were truncated with a cut—off distance of 12A
with a shift function for electrostatics and switch function for the
van der Waals interactions. The protein structures were initially
minimized using 500 steps of steepest descent algorithm followed by
500 steps of conjugate gradient algorithm. Distances between heavy
atoms and hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE algo—
rithm (Ryckaert et (11., 1977) allowing a time step of 2 fs. Each sys—
tem was heated during 200 ps to reach 300 K and then equilibrated
during 400 ps with a temperature window of 300 : 10K. The pro—
duction time was 4 ns for each MD simulation.

2.2 CYP2D6 conformational ensemble generation

For each of the six MD simulations, we extracted structures every
1 ps starting at 1 ns, representing 3000 structures per MD, and a
total 18 000 structures (Fig. 2). For each MD simulation, the RMSD
between the 3000 extracted structures were calculated for all atoms
of the binding site and of the heme moiety. We clustered different
conformations of the binding sites by applying hierarchical ascend—
ing classification (HAC) on the obtained RMSD matrix using the ag—
glomerative Ward’s method as implemented in the R software
(RDevelopmentCoreTeam, 2009), and a final RMSD distance of at
least 1.5  The protein centroid structures of each cluster were then
used for subsequent virtual screening. The binding site volume and
druggability scores of CYP2D6 structures were calculated using the
DoGSiteScorer (Volkamer et (11., 2012) webserver.

2.3 Virtual screening experiments

First, we performed preliminary docking experiments with
AutoDock 4.2 (Morris et (11., 2009) and Vina 1.1.1 (Trott and
Olson, 2010) to probe the docking positions of propafenone, mexi—
letine and codeine in the two CYP2D6 X—ray structures. We
removed the water molecules from the active site for docking and
virtual screening because the analysis of the seven structures of
CYP2D6 co—crystallized with different inhibitors available in PDB

shows that water molecules change significantly their positions de—
pending on the bound ligand, and a key water molecule mediating
the heme—inhibitor interactions was not observed. We obtained the
best docking results using Vina regarding the SOM positions. Then,
VS experiments of 343 inhibitors and 3002 non—inhibitors of
CYP2D6 were carried out using Vina to select the binding site con—
formations best predicting the binding energies among all represen—
tative structures obtained by HAC (see Supplementary Materials for
inhibitors preparation, Lagorce et (11., 2011; Miteva et (11., 2010). A
grid resolution of 1  was used with a number of binding modes of
10 and exhaustiveness of 8 (Trott and Olson, 2010). Thirty—six vir—
tual screening runs were performed on X—ray structures and on pro—
tein structures extracted from MD.

2.4 Machine learning classification modeling

The 343 inhibitor structures were selected as positive set in order to
train machine learning classification models for compounds binding
to CYP2D6. In order to build and validate the models, a balanced
dataset was built by adding to the positive set an equally sized nega—
tive set randomly sampled from 3002 non—inhibitors. An external
validation set was built by randomly taking 20% of both positives
and negatives in the entire dataset. The remaining 80% was used as
training set for the model. To describe topological features of the
structures, we used extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs)
(Carbonell et (11., 2013) up to an atom vicinity of 2. To reduce the
dimensionality of the resulting input feature matrix, we applied
principal component analysis using the statistical package R.

Three machine learning methods were used: a support vector ma—
chine (SVM) by using the kernlab R package (ksvm function)
(Karatzoglou et (11., 2004), a random forest—based predictor by using
the RandomForest R package (Liaw and Wiener, 2002) and a
NaiveBayesian predictor by using the caret R package (Kuhn, 2008).
For each of them we built models using as descriptors the topological
features via ECFP and the protein—ligand binding energies calculated
on the best performing MD receptor conformations. Performance of
each classification model was assessed by the percentage of correctly
classified compounds in comparison with the total number of com—
pounds in the set through leave—one—out cross—validation.

3 Results and Discussion

We developed an integrated structure— and ligand—based in silico ap—
proach able to predict inhibition of CYP2D6. This approach

includes structural information for CYP2D6 based on the available
crystal structures and molecular dynamic simulations that we per—
formed to take into account conformational changes of the binding
site occurring due to the presence of diverse ligands. The approach
also includes information from experimental inhibition studies and
chemical information from ligands.

3.1 Analysis of CYP2D6 X—ray structures

We selected two X—ray structures of CYP2D6: one apo (PDB ID
2F9Q) and one holo co—crystallized with prinomastat (PDB ID
3QM4). The comparison of the available holo X—ray structures of
CYP2D6 (PDB IDs: 3QM4, 3TDA, 4WNT, 4WNU, 4WNV,
4WNW, 3TBG) did not show important differences in the binding
site. However, in the absence or in the presence of bound ligands,
important conformational changes are observed. The apo structure
misses 10 residues and has 3 amino acid substitutions compared
with the WT protein, 2 of which were localized in the or helices F
and G’ (Supplementary Fig. S1A). This structure was repaired using
an in silico protocol (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and the only differ—
ence observed was a larger volume for the fixed protein, increasing
from 657 to 676 A3, due to loop optimization between the helices F
and G’. In our study, the structure called apo is the rebuilt one.

By comparing the two X—ray structures, apo and holo
(Supplementary Fig. S2), a striking difference appears: the apo struc—
ture (Supplementary Fig. S2A) displays a long and regular F or—helix,
while the holo structure (Supplementary Fig. S2B) displays an
or—helix broken into two pieces, named the F and F’ segments
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). By comparing these two X—ray structures
with other CYP2 members, CYP2A6 PDB ID 1210, CYP2C8 PDB
ID 2NN] and CYP2C9 PDB ID lOG2 (Supplementary Fig. SZD), it
is seen that proteins share a similar fold, but considerable differences
appear around the helix F. Indeed, the helix F’ present in the holo
X—ray structure of CYP2D6 is a common feature found in the CYP2
family (Wang et al., 2012a,b, 2015), while the helix F’ is not found
in the apo CYP2D6 structure. The helix G of both X—ray structures
of CYP2D6 (Supplementary Fig. S2C) is shortened regarding the
other members of CYP2 family (Supplementary Fig. S2D). The for—
mation of the helix F’ segment in the holo CYP2D6 structures as
well as the displacement of the surrounding secondary structures
demonstrate the adaptation of the protein to the upcoming ligands.

Regarding the binding site, there are 4 key residues F120, E216,
D301 and F483 involved in the enzyme—substrate interaction
(Marechal et al., 2008) (Supplementary Fig. S3). Residues E216 and
D301 (Supplementary Fig. S3A) are negatively charged and attract
the basic nitrogen of CYP2D6 substrates (Kirton et al., 2002; Paine
et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2015). The residue E216 participates
mainly in the interaction with the ligand (Paine et al., 2003), while
D301 also plays a structural role (Hanna et al., 2001) by interacting
with the backbone of F120 (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B).
The latter controls the orientation of substrates toward the heme
moiety (Flanagan et al., 2004) via n—stacking interaction
(Supplementary Fig. S3B) with an aromatic ring of the CYP2D6 sub—
strates (Supplementary Fig. S3C).

By comparing the orientation of key residues between the apo
and holo X—ray structures, we observe that D301 orientation
(Supplementary Fig. S3A) is conserved maintaining its interaction
with F120. The orientation of F120 is also conserved, thus interact—
ing by n—n stacking with prinomastat (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
However, F483 and E216 have a completely different orientation,
resulting in a larger volume of the binding pocket of 676 A3 in the
apo structure to 712 A3 in the holo one. Thus, the CYP2D6 apo

X—ray structure (Rowland et al., 2006) displays a closed active site
that cannot accommodate its known ligands. CYP2D6 binds com—
pounds with a basic nitrogen positively charged and oxidizes atoms
at a distance of 5—8  from the heme Fe (Hritz et al., 2008; Ito et al.,
2008; Marechal et al., 2008; Rowland et al., 2006; Wang et al.,
2015). In order to explore further the conformational space of the
CYP2D6 active site, we performed MD simulations with three rep—
resentative and diverse CYP2D6 substrates (propafenone, mexiletine
and codeine; Fig. 1) different from the already co—crystallized
CYP2D6 ligands (Wang et al., 2015).

3.2 Docking
We performed docking experiments with propafenone, mexiletine
and codeine. The positions of the SOMs in the docking poses
guided the selection of the best poses. Docking of propafenone
(Fig. 3A) shows a possible H—bond between the positively charged
nitrogen and E216. One of the two aromatic rings interacts with
F483 by n—stacking, and the second aromatic ring is involved in
interaction with F120, the SOM being close to the heme Fe. The
predicted binding energy is —8.2 kcal molil, which shows the rele—
vance of this ligand conformation as a starting pose for the MD
simulations. Docking of mexiletine (Fig. 3B) suggested interactions
between the positively charged nitrogen atom and E216 and a
T—stacking with F120. The distance between the SOM and the
heme Fe is within 6  and the predicted energy is —7.0 kcal molil.
The codeine (Fig. 3C) best docking pose proposed that the SOM is
close to the heme Fe and the aromatic rings system interacts with
F120. Although the positively charged nitrogen atom of codeine is
not oriented toward E216, the predicted binding energy is still fa—
vorable with a value of —8.9 kcalmolil. Being a large and rigid
compound, docking of codeine in the rigid binding site was not
completely successful, highlighting the importance of considering
protein ﬂexibility for such cases. Previously, the key role of F120
was also suggested by a docking study of four inhibitors of
CYP2D6 showing face—to—face and edge—to—face 1r interactions
(Livezey et 41]., 2012).

The poses with the lowest predicted binding energies for each
substrate showing the SOM within 6A around the heme Fe have
been selected as starting conformations for the MD simulations.

3.3 MD simulations to identify diverse binding site
conformations

As previously demonstrated, MD simulations are a pertinent ap—
proach to study the dynamic behavior of CYP family (Nair and
Miners, 2014). After docking, we ran MD simulations. Four MD
simulations have been performed on the apo structure, three in com—
plex with the three ligands (Fig. 1) and one without bound ligand.
Starting from the holo X—ray structure, we ran two MD simulations,

one with the co—crystallized ligand pinomastat and another without
a bound ligand, and thus, in total, six MD simulations were carried
out. During the entire MD simulations the bound propafenone,
mexiletine or codeine remained stable in the active site showing
small ﬂuctuations of the distances to the Fe heme.

Different strategies can be employed in order to select MD—
derived representative structures for further analysis. For example,
Hritz et a1. (2008) extracted 2500 conformations of CYP2D6 from
10 MD simulation runs of 1 ns with 5 different ligands bound in the
active site and docked a limited number of ligands into all 25 00 con—
formations. Considering so many structures for docking without
any classification is not efficient because many redundant structures
of the binding site can be present. In this study, we successfully
reduced the number of structures by applying HAC based on RMSD
of all atoms of the binding sites to the extracted structures. Initially,
3000 structures were extracted for each MD simulation, and thus
18000 structures in total were generated. After our procedure, we
obtained 6 structures from the trajectory based on the apo 2F9Q, 8
structures from the trajectory based on the 2F9Q complexed with
propafenone, 5 structures from the trajectory based on the 2F9Q
complexed with mexiletine, 5 structures from the trajectory based
on the 2F9Q complexed with codeine, 7 structures from the trajec—
tory based on the apo 3QM4 and 3 structures from the trajectory
based on the 3QM4 in complex with its co—crystallized ligand prino—
mastat (in total 34 MD—derived structures).

3.4 Selection of the best MD—derived structures via
virtual screening experiments

Although a number of studies have focused on SOM or inhibition
prediction for CYP using data mining ligand—based approaches
(Kirchmair et al., 2012), only a few structure—based models have
demonstrated their ability to distinguish active from inactive com—
pounds for CYP2D6. Many of those structure—based analyses were
based on a very limited number of compounds for 2D6 (de Graaf
et al., 2006; Rossato et al., 2010). Our curated dataset contained
343 active and 3002 inactive compounds (Supplementary Fig. S4).
We performed virtual screening experiments of this dataset on 34
MD—derived structures and we compared the enrichment results
with those of the two experimental structures (Supplementary Fig.
S5). The best results were obtained on 6 MD—derived structures: one
MD structure from the apo 2F9Q trajectory named MD1 and one
from the 3QM4 trajectory without bound ligand named MD2
(Supplementary Fig. S5A), two MD structures from the trajectory of
2F9Q in complex with propafenone named MD3 and MD4
(Supplementary Fig. S5B) and two MD structures from the trajec—
tory of 2F9Q in complex with mexiletine named MD5 and MD6
(Supplementary Fig. S5C). MD1 and MD2 (Supplementary Fig.
S5A) retrieved active compounds similarly to the experimental struc—
tures. MD3, MD4, MD5 and MD6 (Supplementary Fig. S5C) dis—
criminate better the active compounds than the two experimental
structures. From 1—5% of the ranked compounds library
(Supplementary Fig. S5B), MD3 performed twice better than the
X—ray structures. Similarly, MD5 and MD6 retrieved more active
compounds than the X—ray structures in the early stage of enrich—
ment. From a structural point of view, MD1 (Fig. 4A) shows the
same features as 2F9Q, meaning that the F’ helix is absent.
However, the G’ helix is shorter and displaced into the inner side of
the protein, resulting in a lower active site volume than in the X—ray
structure. MD2 (Fig. 4B) shows the same features as the holo X—ray
structures 3QM4, with or F’ helix present. The at G’ helix is shorter
and the or helices F, G and A are displaced into the outer side of the

protein, resulting in larger binding site volumes (Supplementary
Table S1). Results are more surprising for MD3 and MD4 (Fig. 4C).
Indeed, none of them contains the F’ helix segment and the or G’
helix has disappeared in both cases while the volumes of the cavities
are larger. Regarding MD5 (Fig. 4D), the or G’ helix is shorter and
the or F’ helix seems to be present. MD6 (Fig. 4E) shows a shorter or
G’ helix and a broken or F helix into two or F and F’ helices, as
observed in the 3QM4 structure (Fig. 4F). Interestingly, we were
able to find structures derived from a trajectory initially started
from the apo 2FQ9 structure with docked mexiletine that did not
contain an F’ helix (such as MD6) which reproduce structural fea—
tures of the X—ray holo structure displaying the broken or F helix into
or F and F’ segments. Among the MD—derived structures showing a
good discrimination between active and inactive compounds, we
also found MD3 and MD4 with no G’ helix present. We analyzed
the secondary structures of the MD—derived structures and the five
residues that form the or G’ helix using the program STRIDE (Heinig
and Frishman, 2004). STRIDE was able to identify the or G’ helix for
the structures MD1 (Fig. 4A), MD5 (Fig. 4D) and MD6 (Fig. 4E).
Observing the structures MD3 and MD4, the or G’ helix seems to
disappear. This is supported by STRIDE, which assigned a 3:10 helix
for MD3 structure (Fig. 4C) and a random coil for MD4 structure
(Fig. 4C) without helix. It may be possible that the or G’ helix goes
easily through transitory unstructured states along the MD trajec—
tory taking into account its small number of residues. We also inves—
tigated the appearance of the or F’ helix in MD6 structure using
STRIDE. The at F’ helix is composed of five residues as the or G’
helix. STRIDE assigns an or helix for MD6 structure, which is con—
sistent with our observation. For the other structures, no or F’ helix
was found. These results demonstrate that our MD simulations cor—
rectly suggested that the helix F can be easily broken due to ligand
binding, well supported by the available X—ray structures of
CYP2D6 (Wang et al., 2012a, b, 2015). Our protocol allowed to

showing a better or similar discrimination of the active compounds
than the X—ray structures.

3.5 Analysis of the best MD—derived binding site
structures

We analyzed the differences in the binding site that could be involved
in discriminating inhibitors and non—inhibitors. MD1 structure
shows enrichment close to the X—ray holo structure (Supplementary
Fig. S5A) and displays active site key residues slightly displaced
(Fig. 5A), in particular the two Phe residues. MD2 structure (Fig. 5 B)
as MD1 structure has slightly displaced key residues and changed the
orientation of F120. MD3 and MD4 structures (Fig. 5C) show con—
served D301 and F120 positions, but a displacement of E216. The
most striking difference is due to F483, which exhibits a completely
different orientation. The MD5 and MD6 structures (Fig. 5D) show
significant structural variations. Indeed, although D301 has a well—
conserved orientation, E216 is displaced and both Phe residues have
completely different orientations compared with the X—ray structure.
RMSD calculations between the MD and X—ray structures confirm
these observations (Table 1). Highest RMSD values are obtained for
MD3—MD6 structures. MD3, MD4, MD5 and MD6 structures
(Fig. 5C and D) show better enrichments of active compounds than
the X—ray structure (Supplementary Fig. S5B and C) also having a
different orientation of F483. It seems that although both F120 and
F483 are responsible for the orientation of the ligands in the cavity, a
displacement of F483 allows a better interaction with various lig—
ands. It is also possible to see that a different orientation of F120 in
addition to the F483 displacement (MD5 and MD6 structures)
(Fig. 5D) facilitates the interactions with bulky ligands. Thus, we
have identified MD structures capable of binding small ligands into

bined enrichment is obtained by taking the best binding energies predicted
by docking into MD2, MD4 and MD6

MD3 and MD4 structures (Fig. 5 C), or bulky ligands into MD5 and
MD6 structures (Fig. 5D).

3.6 Small set of MD—derived structures best retrieving
the CYP2D6 binders

We attempted to find a small pool of different structures able to
bind different active compounds of CYP2D6. Keeping in mind the
observed phenomenon of ‘ligand memory’ of the corresponding
binding site (Rueda et al., 2012), we considered three MD struc—
tures, MD2, MD4 and MD6, extracted from MD trajectories with
the three different substrates, showing interesting differences in the
binding site. These MD structures exhibit differences, particularly
nearer to helices F’ and G’ (Fig. 4), and also different conformations
of key binding site residues (Fig. 5). They all have a good druggabil—
ity score (Supplementary Table S1), as well as similar or better en—
richment of CYP2D6 binders than the X—ray structures
(Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Thus, our MD—derived structures seem to
present complementary binding pocket profiles permitting to accom—
modate different ligands. We calculated the combined enrichment of
the three structures, MD2, MD4 and MD6, meaning that for each
percent of the chemical library, we counted all different active mol—
ecules that are retrieved by these three structures. The combined en—
richment of the three MD structures indeed shows better results. In
fact, 70% of CYP2D6 binders were found in 35% of the ranked
dataset when combining docking into the three MD structures
(Fig. 6). These results demonstrated that we identified three comple—
mentary conformations of the active site that can accommodate the
binding of diverse ligands.

3.7 Structure—based QSAR classification

models for CYP2D6

The CYP2D6 X—ray structures and the best performing MD struc—
tures in terms of distinguishing active compounds were considered
in order to train classification models that take into account protein
structure information. We performed modeling using three learning
algorithms: SVM, RandomForest and NaiveBayesian. We built com—
bined models based on topological information of compound struc—
tures using ECFP descriptors and the predicted binding energies
computed on both X—ray and MD protein conformations that best
retrieved the active compounds (Table 2). Accuracies are based on a

leave—one—out (LOO) cross—validation. Each test was repeated ran—
domly 10 times with average accuracies reported in Table 2.
Interestingly, all SVM models that included binding energies slightly
improved the prediction with an increased accuracy (the percentage
of correctly predicted inhibitors and non—inhibitors), for example
from 77.3% to 78.9% for MD6 structure. Regarding the external
dataset, the accuracy of our models is competitive with the recently
reported rule—based tool Cprules predicting CYP2D6 inhibition
(Shao et (11., 2015) (Table 2). Our inhibitor training set involves 343
compounds, which cover most of the chemical diversity of conven—
tional drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (molecular weight 170 to 512,
XlogP 0.4 to 6). The inhibition of CYP2D6 is mainly competitive
and our training set does not contain irreversible inhibitors of
CYP2D6. Thus, we believe that our approach covers CYP2D6 com—
petitive inhibitors. For compounds that do not follow competitive
inhibition, the mechanisms of interactions with the active site could
be quite different. Irreversible inhibitors could have a different MD
behavior from those characterized in this study and may require
additional binding site conformations. In future, new models may be
created based on different CYP2D6 inhibitory mechanisms.

Our model shows that taking into account structural informa—
tion and conformational changes of CYP2D6 binding site allows to
improve traditional QSAR models and to better understand the
mechanism of inhibition. Furthermore, CYP2D6 is the most poly—
morphic isoform of CYP with more than 105 allelic variants identi—
fied to date (http://www.cypalleles.ki.sd) and structure—based
approaches will be essential to account for patient mutations in
order to better predict CYP2D6 drug metabolism and inhibition for
personalized medications.

4 Conclusion

We report an original in silico approach for CYP2D6 inhibition based
on the knowledge of the protein structure and dynamic behavior due
to various ligand binding combined with machine learning modeling

validated on a large number of active and inactive compounds. We
explored a large portion of the conformational space of CYP2D6
using MD simulations with three different substrates that do not have
an experimentally known bioactive conformation and identified MD
structures displaying better performance than the X—ray apo and holo
structures with regard to distinguishing between active and inactive
compounds. In addition, we identified three MD—derived structures
that are capable all together to better retrieve the active compounds
compared with individual CYP2D6 conformations, confirming that
these three binding site conformations have different and complemen—
tary substrate profiles. Our models predicting CYP2D6 inhibition
showed an accuracy of 75% on the external validation set, results
competitive with other recently reported prediction models.

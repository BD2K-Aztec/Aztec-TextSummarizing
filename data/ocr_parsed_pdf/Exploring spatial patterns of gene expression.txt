ABSTRACT

Mobile technologies provide unique opportunities for ubiquitous dis-
tribution of scientific information through user-friendly interfaces.
Therefore, we have developed a new FlyExpress mobile application
that makes available a growing collection (>100 000) of standardized
in situ hybridization images containing spatial patterns of gene expres-
sion from Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) embryogenesis. Using this
application, scientists can visualize and compare expression patterns
of >4000 developmentally relevant genes. The FlyExpress app dis-
plays the expression patterns of the selected gene for different
visual projections (e.g. lateral) and displays them according to their
developmental stages, which shows a gene’s progression of spatial
expression over developmental time. Ultimately, we envision the use
of FlyExpress app in the laboratory where scientists may wish to im-
mediately conduct a visual comparison of a known expression pattern
with the one observed on the bench top or to display expression
patterns of interest during scientific discussions at large.

Ubiquitous access to information has become a part of everyday
life in commercial and personal spheres. However, access to a
vast majority of the scientiﬁc knowledge is primarily restricted to
complex websites that frequently require the use of desktop com-
puters. Today, the need to access primary scientiﬁc data and
results extends far beyond personal desktops, as the scientiﬁc
data and knowledge are needed on—the-go not only during scien-
tiﬁc discussions outside of a formal meeting setting, but also on
the laboratory benches that are not always equipped with general
personal desktop computers. At these venues, mobile devices,
such as smartphones, are always at hand and present a
medium for effective access to information to accelerate discov-
ery and enrich discussion.

Applications developed for mobile devices serve as a new
window to disseminate existing data, and they represent an
alternative to traditional software technology. Mobile applica-
tions compel developers to focus on speciﬁc data cross-sections,
which simpliﬁes data and user navigation for even non-experts
(e.g., Kumar and Hedges, 2011; James et al., 2012). One may
argue that the use of personal devices to deliver scientiﬁc

knowledge to experts and non-experts is the next frontier to dis-
seminate information in this age of digital biology.

Therefore, we have developed a new mobile application for the
iPhone to access images capturing spatial patterns of gene
expression during the development of an embryo in the fruit
ﬂy. Our application uses the large digital library of expression
patterns available in the FlyExpress resource (Kumar et al.,
2011). In the ﬁrst version, we provide spatial patterns in the
FlyExpress resource, from high throughput studies: 48 190
images from Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP
data) and 30095 images from Fly-FISH resource data
(Lecuyer et al., 2007; Tomancak et al., 2002). These data capture
the spatial patterns of thousands of genes (Konikoff et al., 2012).

In FlyExpress, all original expression images from BDGP and
Fly-FISH resources have been size standardized and aligned,
which is necessary for their developmental comparison (Kumar
et al., 2011; Konikoff et al., 2012). In addition, FlyExpress makes
available information on the anatomical View of each image as
well as the developmental stage annotations. Easy access and
exploration of all of these data are available at the user’s ﬁnger-
tips as soon they download the FlyExpress application from the
Apple iTunes store.

Once downloaded, a user launches the application where they
are presented with the main screen that has a gene name search
bar, where the user submits a query to the main FlyExpress data-
base. In addition, the user has the option for querying based on a
gene name synonym, such as ‘giant’ (Fig. 1A). In both cases, the
user is presented with a list of related gene names (Fig. 1B).

Selecting a gene of interest by tapping the row produces a list
of embryo expression patterns image thumbnails (Fig. 1C), The
embryo image are sorted by their developmental timing, such
that they reveal the change in the pattern of gene expression
over time. For any image, detailed scientific information is read-
ily available by selecting the appropriate row (Fig. 1D). This
includes a larger expression pattern image, information on ex-
perimental protocol, link-out to image source, and controlled
vocabulary terms (Fig. 1D).

In the development of the FlyExpress app, we used the indus-
try standard XML and HTTP protocols to access the database
server remotely. To circumvent potential performance challenges
presented by downloading images remotely over the network, we
used asynchronous callbacks to load images in the background
allowing the user interface to remain interactive even in the case
of slow network connection and to display images in a smooth

image cache directory to store loaded images for reuse when a
user returns to a previous screen, and the users can see their last
Viewed image sets for up to 2 days on app relaunch.

The developmental-stage information available from BDGP
and Fly-FISH resources is rather coarse, as images are grouped
into six-stage ranges in BDGP data (173, 46, 778, 9710, 11712
or 13716), whereas Fly-FISH embryos are classiﬁed into
ﬁve-stage ranges (173, 45, $7, 879 and later) (see Konikoff
et al., 2012 for details). This represents low resolution develop-
mental time information, with each group of images capturing
signiﬁcant changes in spatial expression of each gene correspond-
ing to major embryogenesis events. Therefore, we have been de-
veloping novel machine-learning methods to determine the
developmental order of expression patterns by means of compu-
tational analysis (manuscript in preparation). The FlyExpress
app provides access to initial results from these approaches for
images from BDGP data. For example, all expression patterns in
Figure 1C belong to the stage Group 4e6 in the BDGP data,
which when ordered using our new method produce a better
picture of the changes in gene expression over time for giant,
which is shown in Figure 1C.

When presenting these results, the FlyExpress app enables the
user to View expression patterns in a number of ways. In addition
to a list of image thumbnails shown in a columnar format, the user
has the option to ﬁlter the image list by selecting either a BDGP or
Fly-FISH source and to ﬁlter by different anatomical Views
(lateral, ventral, dorsal and other). In addition, we developed a
carousel image Viewer where users can View sets of larger images in
an interactive “carousel” scroll View, allowing them to swipe
through the images that are displayed in the order of developmen-
tal stages (Fig. 2). We also make available an animation in which
expression patterns from consecutive stages are morphed to
dynamically display changes in expression over time.

In the near future, we plan to enhance the FlyExpress app
to contain ﬁner-stage annotations for all the data, including
searching of expression patterns based on GEMs (Genome-
scale Expression Maps; Konikoff et al., 2012). Overall, the

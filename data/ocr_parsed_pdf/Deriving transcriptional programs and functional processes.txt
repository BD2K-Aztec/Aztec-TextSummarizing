ABSTRACT

Motivation: A system-wide approach to revealing the underlying
molecular state of a cell is a long-standing biological challenge.
Developed over the last decade, gene expression profiles possess
the characteristics of such an assay. They have the capacity to reveal
both underlying molecular events as well as broader phenotypes
such as clinical outcomes. To interpret these profiles, many gene
sets have been developed that characterize biological processes.
However, the full potential of these gene sets has not yet been
achieved. Since the advent of gene expression databases, many
have posited that they can reveal properties of activities that are not
evident from individual datasets, analogous to how the expression
of a single gene generally cannot reveal the activation of a biological
process.

Results: To address this issue, we have developed a high-
throughput method to mine gene expression databases for the
regulation of gene sets. Given a set of genes, we scored it against
each gene expression dataset by looking for enrichment of co-
regulated genes relative to an empirical null distribution. After
validating the method, we applied it to address two biological
problems. First, we deciphered the E2F transcriptional network.
We confirmed that true transcriptional targets exhibit a distinct
regulatory profile across a database. Second, we leveraged the
patterns of regulation across a database of gene sets to produce
an automatically generated catalog of biological processes. These
demonstrations revealed the power of a global analysis of the data
contained within gene expression databases, and the potential for
using them to address biological questions.

1 INTRODUCTION

The state of a cell is reﬂected in its transcriptional proﬁle. Both
molecular events (such as the activation of a cell surface receptor,
loss of function of a tumor suppressor or initiation of the cell cycle)
and functional attributes (sensitivity to therapeutics or propensity
to metastasize) are evident in gene expression (Bild et (11., 2006;
Lamb et (11., 2006; Miller et (11., 2005; Perou et (11., 2000; Whitﬁeld
et (11., 2002; Zhang et (11., 2009). They can be measured on a DNA

microarray and recognized by computational algorithms. Because
such a diverse range of molecular activities can be identiﬁed from
the same gene expression proﬁles (Hughes et (11., 2000; Lamb et (11.,
2006), we argue that gene expression contains the complete (or
nearly complete) compendium of the underlying cellular activities.
In other words, a gene expression proﬁle embodies the state of a cell.

Currently, a major challenge is to interpret gene expression
proﬁles. A common approach is to construct narratives based on the
functions of the genes showing changes in gene expression. This
is made difﬁcult, however, by a limited understanding of what the
genes do, compounded by pleiotropy in gene function. One solution
to these problems is to consider that biological processes are brought
about by the activation of many genes. Thus, taking into account the
co-ordinated activities of sets of genes yields insight into processes
that are not evident from the expression of single genes. To capitalize
on this idea, many have generated gene expression signatures that
evince a biological activity. Although signatures can take different
forms, the vast majority consists simply of lists of genes that are
involved in biological processes. This type of signature is also
called a gene set, and MSigDB is the largest database (Liberzon
et (11., 2011).

To predict the activation of signatures from gene expression
proﬁles, many computational algorithms have been developed
(Barbie et (11 ., 2009; Liu et (11., 2008; Spang et (11 ., 2002; Subramanian
et (11., 2005; Tavazoie et (11., 1999). While these algorithms operate
on single datasets, many have anticipated methods that can tap into
gene expression databases ever since their development a decade
ago (Bassett et (11., 1999; Hunter et (11., 2001). The expectation
was that such resources contain rich biological phenotypes that
could be mined for value. To do this, a wealth of approaches have
been developed that can search gene expression databases based on
associated metadata, but there are fewer options for searching the
gene expression proﬁles themselves (Praz et (11 ., 2004; Rhodes et (11.,
2007; Yu et (11., 2009; Zhu et (11., 2008). To date, there have been two
systems. The ﬁrst, SPELL, was developed to predict Gene Ontology
(GO) terms for yeast genes based on patterns seen across a gene
expression database (Ashbumer et (11., 2000; Hibbs et (11., 2007).
Although it does score the datasets, the focus is on the annotation
of single genes, and it does not provide a statistical signiﬁcance.
A more recently developed algorithm does provide the signiﬁcance,
but requires as input a weighted list of genes and thus cannot be
applied to gene sets, which are unweighted (Engreitz et (11., 2010b).
Therefore, there is not yet an ability to fully capitalize on the data
within gene expression databases.

To address the need for a method to mine gene expression
databases, we have developed a novel approach to identify the

datasets in which a given gene set is regulated. At its heart is a
coherence-based algorithm based on the straightforward notion that
if a gene set is tightly regulated in a dataset, as evidenced by high
correlation among its genes, then it must play an important role
in that condition (Banerjee and Zhang, 2003; Beer and Tavazoie,
2004; Pilpel et (11., 2001; Singh et (11., 2007). Applying this, algorithm
across a gene expression database then generates a regulatory proﬁle
that reveals the cellular conditions in which a speciﬁc biological
process is tightly regulated. To accomplish this, we extended
the coherence algorithm to work at large scale by developing a
novel approach to estimate the signiﬁcance of a coherence score.
Then, we evaluated the accuracy of the resulting method on two
tasks in which the outcome is known: identifying regulation of
oncogenic pathways, and predicting the tissue speciﬁcity of gene
sets. Finally, we applied it to address two unsolved biological
questions: unraveling the combinatorial regulatory network of the
E2F transcription factors, and developing an unbiased catalog of
biological processes. These experiments demonstrated the utility of
the concept of a regulatory proﬁle and the power of leveraging gene
expression databases in addressing a range of biological questions.

2 METHODS

We have developed a method to quantify the evidence for the regulation
of a gene set in microarray gene expression dataset (Fig. 1A). This method
was an extension of a previously described coherence score that measured
whether a set of genes in a gene set was signiﬁcantly co-regulated in a dataset
(Pilpel et (11.. 2001). Brieﬂy. to calculate this score given a gene set and a
microarray gene expression dataset. we selected the genes from the gene set
and calculated the pairwise Pearson correlations of their expression proﬁles
(Fig. 1B). Next. we discarded the insigniﬁcant correlations that could be
obtained from at least 95% of random pairs of genes. The coherence score
was the maximum number of genes with signiﬁcant correlations. To obtain
a P-Value for the score. we generated a null distribution by repeating this
procedure with sets of randomly selected genes (Fig. 1C). This background
distribution was conditioned upon the size of the gene set. and empirically.
we found that this distribution also varied across datasets (data not shown).
Because it was not computationally practical to sample the null distribution
exactly for all gene set sizes across a large gene expression database. we
developed a novel strategy where we computed the null distribution for a
limited number of sizes of gene sets and then estimated the distributions for
the remaining sizes (Fig. 2A). We did this by modeling the background
distribution using Parzen windows (Fig. 2B) and then interpolating the
distributions for arbitrary sizes of gene sets (Fig. 2C). See the Supplementary
Materials for a detailed description of this algorithm.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Matching gene sets to datasets

To evaluate the accuracy of the coherence score, we applied it to
nine microarray datasets containing gene sets of cell cycle signaling
pathways generated from human mammary epithelial cells (Bild
et (11., 2006; Gatza et (11., 2010). Each dataset consisted of samples
from ~10 replicates of cells where an oncogenic pathway was
activated, and ~10 replicates where the pathway was inactivated.
From each dataset, we derived a set of the genes whose expression
changed in response to pathway activity. Then, we tested whether
the coherence score could recognize regulation of each gene set in
the proper dataset.

signiﬁcant correlations. We ﬁnally derive a coherence score based on the
number of genes that exhibit signiﬁcant correlation. (C) We can calculate
the statistical signiﬁcance of the coherence score from the scores that are
obtained by gene sets comprised of randomly selected genes.

size of the gene set. This plot shows histograms of the density (Y—axis) of
the coherence scores (X -axis) from randomly generated gene sets of various
sizes (Z-axis) sampled from dataset GSE15026. As the size of the gene set
increases. the expected size of the coherence score also increases. These
comprise the null distribution of the coherence score for gene sets of speciﬁc
sizes. (B) The density of the coherence score for a speciﬁc size of gene set
(400 genes shown here) can be modeled with Parzen windows (shown in the

we can estimate its null distribution using linear interpolation from those that

450 (shown as a red line) is interpolated from those of sizes 400 and 500
(shown as black bars). Coherence scores with equivalent P-Values across the
three sizes of gene sets are shown.

Each column represents a gene set and the rows contain of the datasets. The last row indicates the number of unique genes in each the gene set. For each gene set, the dataset with

the highest coherence score is indicated by bold values.

For the evaluation, we calculated the coherence scores for each
gene set across each dataset (Table 1). As a control, we selected a
biologically distant E2F gene set generated from genes induced by
E2F1 or E2F2 in mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts (Ishida et (11., 2001).
The data showed that the gene set for each pathway obtained the
highest coherence score in the corresponding dataset, indicating
that the coherence measure could correctly identify the dataset with
the most signiﬁcant regulation of the gene set. To show that the
coherence scores were statistically signiﬁcant, we generated the
null distribution for each gene set from 100 000 random samples
and found that the correct dataset in each case was signiﬁcant with
P <0.00001 (Supplementary Table 51). Furthermore, the relative
magnitudes of the scores recapitulated known biological connections
among the pathways. For instance, while the E2F1 gene set scored
highest in the E2F1 dataset, the second highest score was obtained in
the E2F3 dataset. Conversely, the E2F3 gene set was second highest
in the E2F1 dataset. The close relation of the coherence scores likely
reﬂects the fact that these proteins can transcriptionally activate
many of the same targets (Trimarchi and Lees, 2002). However, there
were known distinctions in their ﬁinctions as well. E2F1 has aunique
ability to induce apoptosis in a manner connected to PI3K/Akt
signaling that is not been seen in E2F3 (Hallstrom et (11., 2008;
Kowalik et (11., 1995). Mirroring the biochemical dichotomy, the
E2F1 gene set scored relatively high in the PI3K and Akt datasets,
whereas the E2F3 gene set did not. In the analysis of the mouse
E2F1/2 gene set, it scored highest against the E2F1 dataset and
ﬁfth against E2F3, behind P63, PI3K and Akt, suggesting that the
conditions used to generate this gene set may have triggered an
apoptotic response. Taken together, these analyses demonstrated
that the coherence score could accurately quantify regulation among
closely linked pathways.

3.2 Predicting tissue speciﬁcity of gene sets

As a ﬁirther evaluation of the ability of the algorithm to quantify
regulation, we tested whether it could correctly distinguish the tissue
of origin of a gene set. We leveraged the two facts that (i) many
gene sets were generated within a speciﬁc tissue context, and (ii)
many gene expression datasets contained samples collected from
a single type of tissue. Because gene sets could contain imprints
of tissue-speciﬁc transcriptional programs, we reasoned that they
should score higher in datasets from the same tissue than those from

others. This was a difﬁcult test case because the biological processes
embodied by the gene sets were convoluted with the signal from the
tissue type.

For this experiment, we collected 406 gene sets from MSigDB
and 918 datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) gene
expression database covering 13 different tissues (Barrett et (11.,
2011). We then applied our algorithm and scored the signiﬁcance
of all pairwise associations of the gene sets and datasets. As a
comparison, we implemented the Z-test and SPELL algorithms,
as well as a random scoring ﬁinction as a baseline (Hibbs et (11.,
2007). For the 4 algorithms, we ranked all 372 708 associations by
score and calculated the recall and precision curves, counting an
association correct if the gene set and dataset were generated from
the same tissue. While all algorithms performed better than random,
the coherence score obtained signiﬁcantly higher precision for the
same levels of recall as compared with the others (Fig. 3A).

Although this experiment demonstrated an ability to identify
tissue-speciﬁc signals in the gene sets, a limitation of the approach
stems from the fact that many biological processes generated similar
transcriptional proﬁles across tissues, and in this case, a gene set
would obtain a high regulation score in multiple tissues. To control
for this, we collated all scores for each gene set and scored the
signiﬁcance of their association with each tissue type. So for each
gene set, we counted the number of datasets of each tissue type
that was signiﬁcantly associated with it (false discovery rate; FDR
< 0.01), and calculated the statistical signiﬁcance of the association
using a Fisher’s exact test (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). We
then predicted the tissue that obtained the highest classiﬁcation. If
no datasets reached the statistical cutoff, then no prediction was
made. While the previous test generated 372708 predictions, this
one produced only 406, one for each gene set.

Comparing the coherence and Z-test algorithms, we found that the
coherence score could predict the tissue for 167 out of 406 gene sets
(the remaining did not achieve statistical signiﬁcance), of which 81%
were correct (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Table S2). In comparison, the
Z-test made fewer predictions, 132, with an accuracy of 73%. Thus,
the coherence score obtained a higher accuracy with a larger number
of predictions. Because the SPELL algorithm did not produce
P-values, we could not determine a statistical cutoff for determining
association. Nevertheless, we tried a range of ad-hoc cutoffs and
found that it could achieve 172 predictions with an accuracy of 60%
(data not shown).

and a random baseline algorithm to identify gene sets and datasets of the same
tissue type. The recall (X -axis) and precision (Y—axis) curves are shown for
each algorithm. (B) For each gene set. we group together the scores across
all datasets and generate a single tissue type prediction for that gene set.
These matrices show the correct tissue type on the vertical access and the
predicted tissue type on the horizontal. The numbers in the matrices indicate
the number of gene sets predicted. The gene sets on the diagonal are predicted
correctly. while those off the diagonal are incorrect. The ﬁnal two columns
of the matrices show the total number of gene sets predicted and the percent
of predictions that are correct for each tissue type. Prediction matrices are
provided for the coherence and Z-test algorithms.

Overall, these results demonstrated that the coherence measure
was best able to detect the regulation of tissue-speciﬁc
transcriptional programs in the gene sets. Furthermore, it also
suggested that while the gene sets embodied biological processes,
they could also be inﬂuenced by the context of the cell type, a
dimension that had not previously been systematically investigated.

3.3 Deciphering transcriptional regulatory programs

Having observed that our algorithm could accurately detect
regulation of gene sets, we then applied it to decipher transcriptional
regulatory programs. While the principle that combinations of
transcription factors regulate the expression of genes is now well
understood, knowledge of the functioning of speciﬁc transcription
factors and co-factors remains limited (Fedorova and Zink, 2008;
Ravasi et (11., 2010; Stanojevic et (11., 1991). One common
approach to identifying co-factors is based on over-representation
of transcription factor binding sites in sequences from promoters

or ChIP experiments (Berger et (11., 2008; Harbison et (11., 2004;
Johnson et (11., 2007). A limitation is that sequences do not provide
evidence of ﬁinctional activation. To address this, we applied our
algorithm to identify transcriptional co-factors based on evidence of
regulation across a large gene expression database.

We chose as our model of combinatorial regulation the E2F family
of transcription factors. E2F regulates the cell cycle transition from
G1 to S phase and is also involved in apoptosis, development
and other functions (Dimova and Dyson, 2005; Nevins, 1998).
Functionally, it sits at the nexus of many processes that drive the
cancer phenotype and is, thus, an important area of research. E2F
activates target genes dependent upon the presence of transcriptional
co-activators. While some co-factors have been established, they do
not yet explain the regulation of the diversity of activities and it is
believed that others are required to maintain proper E2F function.

To identify potential E2F co-factors, we paired it with each
other transcription factor from the TRANSFAC and JASPAR
databases, a total of 634 possible pairs (Bryne et (11., 2008;
Matys et (11., 2006). For each pair, we collected the genes whose
promoters contained binding sites for both transcription factors
at a signiﬁcance of P<0.0001 within 500bp (Fig. 4A). Those
genes comprised a gene set for the predicted regulatory target of
E2F and its co-factor. We scored each of the gene sets against
the 2641 datasets in our GEO database (Supplementary Table
S3) and obtained their regulatory proﬁles. In each proﬁle, we
counted the number of datasets that exhibited signiﬁcant regulation
(FDR <0.01; Supplementary Table S3). Finally, we plotted the
regulatory proﬁles of each co-factor that was signiﬁcant in at least
10 datasets across 2 principal components (Fig. 4B). These results
revealed that the co-factors that exhibited the broadest regulation
corresponded to known co-factors, such as NFY, SP1, TFE3 (an
EBOX binding protein) and YY1 (Giangrande et (11., 2003; Karlseder
et (11., 1996; Schlisio et (11., 2002; Zhu et (11., 2004). As a control,
we also identiﬁed E2F itself. One known co-factor that we did
not recognize was MYB (Zhu et (11., 2004). A major difference
between MYB and the other co-factors is that it regulates events
at the G2/M transition of the cell cycle while the others operate
at Gl/S. This suggests that the approach outlined here may be
sensitive to the regulatory proﬁle of the co-factors being proﬁled.
Nevertheless, the algorithm recovered known E2F co-factors, and
the remaining ones represented experimentally testable predictions
that were supported by evidence from both promoter sequence and
transcriptional regulation. Using this analysis, we could predict the
identity of the co-factors, but could not distinguish which E2F is the
partner because they all interact with the same consensus promoter
sequence. Given these results, this initial demonstration shows the
power of leveraging large gene expression databases for decoding
combinatorial transcriptional regulatory programs and suggests a
framework for deciphering the complete transcriptional regulatory
network across all genes.

3.4 An unbiased catalog of biological processes

A long-standing problem is how to identify the underlying processes
that drive the phenotype of a cell. While gene expression proﬁles,
which show the activation of individual genes, is one approach,
individual genes provide only limited insight into the processes
that are driven by the actions of multiple ones. The solution, then,
is to examine sets of genes for enrichment of GO annotations

Fig. 4. (A) To score the regulatory potential of a pair of transcription factors.
we ﬁrst identify the genes in the genome that contain binding sites for
E2F as well as a potential co-factor. These genes comprise the gene set
for the co-factor. Then. we score the regulation of this gene set across
our gene expression database. generating a proﬁle showing the breadth
of the regulation of this gene set across the datasets. (B) We plot the
regulatory proﬁles of each transcription co-factor onto the ﬁrst two principal
components. Each circle represents a position weight matrix (PWM) for a co-
factor. Some co-factors are represented by multiple PWMs. and appear more
than once in the plot. E2F co-factors that have previously been identiﬁed
experimentally are colored according to the legend.

(Huang da et al., 2009a). However, a limitation of this approach is the
dependence upon the comprehensiveness of G0, which is created
based on manual curation of biological functions. To investigate
this issue, we sought to develop a catalog of unbiased biological
processes (UBPs).

To deﬁne the UBPs, our solution was to leverage gene sets. While
in principle, MSigDB already provides gene sets that can be used
to describe biological processes, the reality is that many distinct
gene sets can describe the same one (Ein-Dor et al., 2005). Thus,
we used MSigDB as a starting point and reﬁned it based on their
regulatory proﬁles. We did this by computing a proﬁle for each
of the 6769 gene sets against our GEO database and discarding
the ones that did not achieve signiﬁcant regulation (see Section 2).
Then, to identify groups of gene sets sharing similar transcriptional
proﬁles, we applied afﬁnity propagation (Frey and Dueck, 2007).
This yielded a collection of 115 distinct UBPs made from 995 gene
sets (Fig. 5). Each UBP was associated with between 2 and 32 gene
sets (median 7), and 11 and 4431 genes (median 593).

To compare the UBPs with G0, we annotated each one
using GATHER (Chang and Nevins, 2006). First, we noted that
many of the GO functions were signiﬁcant across multiple UBPs
(Supplementary Table S4). For example, the annotations immune
response and metabolism were each signiﬁcantly associated with 16
programs, with no overlap between them. Indeed, 32% of all UBPs
were involved in either cell cycle: metabolic or immune response
activities, demonstrating their breadth and complexity of regulation.
However, these general processes could be broken down into more
speciﬁc functions. For instance, UBP 99 consists of gene sets more
generally associated with cell cycle, and is connected to UBP 74,
which is more speciﬁcally associated with M phase and related
cytoskeletal events (Fig. 5). Similarly, metabolic activities could be

broken down into glycoprotein biosynthesis (UBP 100), nucleotide
biosynthesis (UBP 79), carbohydrate metabolism (UBP 35) and
others. This demonstrated that these processes corresponded to
well-deﬁned functions and also made distinctions among them.

Overall, we saw a broad concordance between our processes
and GO terms (Supplementary Table S5). As examples, UBP
91 contained gene sets for chemokines, cytokines, 1L4 and
inﬂammatory response, a clear correspondence to its GO term for
immune response (FDR = 10‘225). Similarly, UBP 93 included
gene sets for base excision repair, double strand break repair and
homologous recombination; and was annotated with the GO term
for DNA repair (FDR = 10‘225). Finally, UBP 108, UV response,
apoptosis and programmed cell death, had the GO term for apoptosis
(FDR = 1045).

However, a signiﬁcant number of UBPs did not relate directly
to GO functions. One possibility is that they were artifacts that
did not correspond to any physiological events. To determine
whether this was the case, we examined the gene sets for
these UBPs and found several reasons why they could not be
annotated with G0. For one, the gene sets for UBP 43 suggested
a regulatory program associated with differentiation of breast
cancer subtypes, e.g. FARMER_BREAST_CANCER_BASAL_VS-
_LUMINAL. The assigned GO terms, morphogenesis (FDR =
10TH) or development (FDR = 10‘10), supported the biology
driving the subtypes, but did not include one speciﬁcally associated
to the breast subtypes in the process. While GO included terms
describing breast differentiation, they referred only to events in
normal development. Even though this UBP was among the largest
processes (comprised of 23 individual gene sets), indicating a great
interest in this phenotype, there was not a G0 annotation available
for describing it. As another example, UBP 10 was comprised of
gene sets for transcriptional targets of MYC, a master regulator of
the cell cycle. But, it was assigned a more generic GO annotation of

Fig. 6. (A) We generated 16 sinusoidal waves that peaked every 2 h across
a 32h cell cycle dataset. The ﬁrst eight waves are shown here. (B) These
heatmaps show the percentage of simulations in which a UBP (on the rows)
are signiﬁcantly associated with a sine wave that peaks at a speciﬁc time (on
the columns). The UBPs are manually ordered so that those that peak earlier
are shown closer to the top. The three heatmaps show the results when the
procedure is applied to a cell cycle dataset. the dataset shufﬂed to remove

cell proliferation (FDR = 10‘”). To test whether the differences in
the GO terms were due to limitations in the annotation tool, we re-
ran the analyses using DAVID and saw no notable differences (data
not shown) (Huang da et al., 2009b). Thus, in these cases, the GO
annotations supported the process described by the gene sets, but
the ontology itself lacked precise terms to describe the underlying
process.

To evaluate (i) whether the UBPs were biologically meaningful,
and (ii) whether the GO annotations accurately described the
ﬁinction of the UBPs, we scored the UBPs against a cell cycle
dataset measuring the expression proﬁles of synchronized human
cells for one cell cycle after serum stimulation (Bar-Joseph et al.,
2008). Since it has previously been shown that cycling genes can
be modeled by sine waves (Whitﬁeld et al., 2002), we generated
a series of waves that peaked every 2h, and used Signiﬁcance
Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) to score whether the gene sets
from the UBPs exhibit sinusoidal oscillation (Fig. 6A; Efron and
Tibshirani, 2007). We used two negative controls: we shufﬂed with
disrupted temporal order and a breast cancer dataset that should
contain no sinusoidal expression patterns (Sircoulomb et al., 2010).
From this experiment, we ﬁnd a set of UBPs that are expressed at
different times across the cell cycle, and not in the negative controls
(Fig. 6B). Examining the GO annotations associated with them,
we ﬁnd that Metabolism is associated with UBPs across all time
points, while DNA replication is limited to UBPs that peak ~20—
26h (Fig. 6C), which corresponds closely with the accumulation
of 4N DNA content in the published ﬂow cytometry data. This
demonstrates that the UBPs are biologically meaningful and that
their activity can be detected in gene expression data.

Although G0 is by far the most popular vocabulary for describing
biological processes, as attested by the number of tools developed
to use those annotations, our analysis shows that it is limited in its
ability to describe the entirety of biological processes. The reason
for this is due to both the enormity of the task of describing all
processes of interest and another is because many processes are not
yet studied or understood. Therefore, we propose that an unbiased
approach to catalog observed biological processes results in a more
precise and empirical measure of independently regulated biological
processes. We do not claim that the UBPs will replace GO, but
it may supplement it with an independent catalog of biological
process.

To our knowledge, there are two prior efforts to automatically
derive biological processes from databases of gene expression
proﬁles. One identiﬁed network motifs that are common across
multiple human datasets, resulting in 143 400 functionally
homogeneous modules (Huang et al., 2007). The second performed a
matrix decomposition using independent component analysis across
human gene expression data (Engreitz et al., 2010a). Using this
approach, they found 423 statistically independent components
that could be linked to ﬁinctional annotations. Including UBP,
there are now three distinct automatically generated databases of
biological process: one that represents process as a gene set, one
where processes are modeled as weighted gene signatures and
one where processes are networks of co-expressed genes. While
it is likely that these catalogs would also be incomplete, they
nevertheless provide practical frameworks that can be reﬁned as
algorithms and databases are updated.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Signatures or gene sets form the dominant strategy behind current
efforts to decipher the meaning behind cellular transcriptional
proﬁles. While a gene expression proﬁle can be thought of as a
high-throughput method to measure the expression levels of genes,
signatures provide a means to interpret the larger scale processes
that are brought about by the concerted efforts of groups of genes.
The ultimate goal is the capacity to derive an understanding of the
state of a cell based on its transcriptional proﬁle. To get closer to this
goal, we have investigated the novel concept of a regulatory proﬁle
that revealed the regulation of gene set across a gene expression
database, and we have developed a method to derive this proﬁle.
Analogous to how a gene expression proﬁle reveals information
not evident in single genes, a regulatory proﬁle reveals patterns by
tapping into the power and richness of biological phenotypes across
a gene expression database.

While the use of the coherence measure to quantitate the
regulation of a gene set was not novel, our contribution was the
mechanics to compute it so that it could be scaled to score gene
sets across gene expression databases. However, there were several
limitations of our approach. First, because we used an empirical
null distribution, the sensitivity of the approach was limited by the
amount of sampling done. This leads to a fundamental consequence
of this approach, which is that, while we can distinguish the relative
regulation of a gene set across multiple datasets, the complementary
analysis is difﬁcult. Given a single dataset, it can be hard to
differentiate the activation across multiple gene sets, since they may
all be very signiﬁcant, as can be seen in Supplementary Table 51.
Furthermore, the sampling required would grow linearly with the

size of the gene expression database. Finally, our scoring method
did not distinguish between genes that were up-regulated and those
that were down-regulated.

Nevertheless, applying regulatory proﬁles, we provided
demonstrations of how they may be used to solve critical biological
problems. In the ﬁrst analysis, we used the proﬁles to recapitulate
the known portion of the E2F transcriptional regulatory program,
as well as to predict several other previously unreported co-factors.
For the second, we leveraged the proﬁles to generate an unbiased
catalog of 115 distinct biological processes. Because these were
generated in an unbiased method, we propose that this represents
a more robust foundation to decipher the processes underlying a
cellular state. In sum, these experiments have revealed the value that
can be derived by tapping into the power of large gene expression
databases.

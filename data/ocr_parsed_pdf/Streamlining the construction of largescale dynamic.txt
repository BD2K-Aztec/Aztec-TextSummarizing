ABSTRACT

Motivation: Studying biological systems, not just at an individual
component level but at a system-wide level, gives us great potential
to understand fundamental functions and essential biological
properties. Despite considerable advances in the topological analysis
of metabolic networks, inadequate knowledge of the enzyme
kinetic rate laws and their associated parameter values still
hampers large-scale kinetic modelling. Furthermore, the integration
of gene expression and protein levels into kinetic models is not
straightforward.

Results: The focus of our research is on streamlining the
construction of large-scale kinetic models. A novel software tool was
developed, which enables the generation of generic rate equations
for all reactions in a model. It encompasses an algorithm for
estimating the concentration of proteins for a reaction to reach
a particular steady state when kinetic parameters are unknown,
and two robust methods for parameter estimation. It also allows
for the seamless integration of gene expression or protein levels
into a reaction and can generate equations for both transcription
and translation. We applied this methodology to model the yeast
glycolysis pathway; our results show that the behaviour of the system
can be accurately described using generic kinetic equations.

its source code in Java, is available from our project web site at

1 INTRODUCTION

The current availability of annotated genomes and detailed ‘-omics’
data makes it possible to construct stoichiometric genome-scale
metabolic networks that include all reactions, metabolites and
proteins. Systems biology aims to examine the properties and
dynamics of cellular processes as a whole rather than in isolated
parts of a cell or an organism (Kitano, 2002). Integrating cellular
components is essential for our understanding of how interactions

between these components inﬂuence cellular functions. One aspect
of this integration is the need to integrate proteins and other cellular
components into metabolic networks. For example, Forster and
Palsson (2003) manually reconstructed a genome-scale integrative
model of gene expression and metabolism of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (1175 metabolic reactions, 584 metabolites and 708 open
reading frames).

Stoichiometric models, which describe the topology of a
metabolic network, provide limited insights into the functioning of
cellular processes. To understand the detailed dynamics of cellular
functions and their regulation, it is necessary to advance toward
kinetic models where the behaviour of a system can be perturbed.
The construction of a genome-scale kinetic model of a biological
cell requires the integration of genomic, proteomic, metabolomic
and ﬂuxomic data along with thermodynamic information (J amshidi
and Palsson, 2008). Attempts for building such large-scale kinetic
models are now starting to emerge. Ao et a1. (2008) provided a
systematic method for constructing large-scale kinetic metabolic
models and addressed the problem of estimating kinetic parameters.
J amshidi and Palsson (2008) described a framework for building and
analysing large-scale kinetic models and presented the mathematical
challenges associated with the construction of such models.
In a cell-scale model, the number of reactions, metabolites and
proteins can reach several thousands, making it time-consuming
and costly, if not impossible, to accurately measure individual
concentrations of metabolites, ﬂuxes and kinetic parameters.

There is often inadequate knowledge of enzymatic—kinetic laws
and their associated parameter values, and usually parameters
obtained from the literature are dependent on speciﬁc in vitro or
in viva experimental conditions. Yet, there is growing awareness
that exact rate equations and parameters are often not crucial
in determining the dynamic properties of large systems. This
principle has been illustrated by the development of methods for
‘bridging the gap’ between structural and kinetic modelling. Steuer
et al. (2006) proposed a method that aimed to give account of
the dynamical capabilities of metabolic systems without requiring
explicit information about the rate equations, and they showed that
it was possible to acquire a detailed quantitative representation of
metabolic systems without explicitly referring to a set of differential
equations. Smallbone et al. (2007) presented a method for building
kinetic models solely based on reaction stoichiometries of a network
using linlog kinetics. Their results showed good agreement between
the real dynamics and their approximation in a yeast glycolysis
model. Ao et al. (2008) also acknowledged that the scarcity of
experimental data for rate equations and parameters is a major

Generic kinetic equations

 

difﬁculty in the construction of large kinetic models, and to alleviate
this difﬁculty, they used a generic form of rate equations with
a minimum set of parameters to construct a metabolic model
of Methylobacterium extorquens AMl. Their results showed that
attaining the correct dynamical behaviour of a system is possible
without the use of extensive and accurately measured rate equations
and kinetic parameters. Furthermore, through an analysis of several
systems biology models, Gutenkunst et al. (2007) suggested that
parameter ﬁtting to experimental data still leaves parameters poorly
constrained and that biological systems are often robust to large
parameter variations. The success of a model is therefore more
dependent on an accurate prediction of the main behaviours of a
system rather than on a thorough determination of large numbers of
parameter values.

In order to streamline the construction of large-scale dynamic
models, the difﬁculties related to the manual assembly of large
networks and the generation of customized rate equations and
parameters need to be addressed. For this reason, we de-
veloped a software tool named GRaPe (Gene-Reaction-Protein
integration). GRaPe uses generic reversible Michaelis—Menten rate
equations based on the number of substrates and products for all
reactions in the network. The Michaelis—Menten relation offers a
reliable approximation of the kinetics obeyed by most enzyme-
catalytic reactions. Furthermore, most reactions of importance
in biochemistry are reversible in the practical sense (Cornish-
Bowden, 2004). We make two distinctive assumptions, namely
that compartmentalization of the cell and metabolite—enzyme
interactions play a negligible role in determining the behaviour of a
system. GRaPe then creates a kinetic model of the metabolic system
using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are automatically
generated based on the stoichiometric matrix of the network.

While many tools exist for the modelling and simulation of
complex biological dynamic systems, e.g. CellDesigner (Funahashi
et al., 2003), COPASI (Mendes et (11., 2006), Biological-Networks
(Baitaluk et (11., 2006), E-Cell (Tomita et al., 1999), CADLIVE
(Kurata et al., 2003) and Cellware (Dhar et al., 2004), none of
these tools allows for the generation of rate equations from the
stoichiometry and for the seamless integration of gene or protein
levels into a metabolic network without time-consuming and error-
prone manual intervention. Our aim is not to duplicate these
tools by creating another simulation software, but to introduce an
upstream solution for the rapid generation of large-scale dynamic
models, which can be exported for simulation by existing software
applications. Being consistent with the standards of systems
biology, GRaPe supports the exchange of Systems Biology Markup
Language (SBML; Hucka et al., 2003) level 2 version 1 and 2
documents.

In this article, we provide an overview of the main features
of GRaPe and present a proof-of-principle of the applicability of
our approach to the construction of large-scale kinetic models. In
particular, we compare the features of a model of the yeast glycolysis
pathway based on generic equations automatically generated by
GRaPe with a model of the same pathway constructed by Teusink
et a1. (2000) that was based on an experimental determination of rate
equations and parameters. Our results show an excellent agreement
between both models, supporting the hypothesis that kinetic models
using generic equations could successﬁilly reproduce the global
behaviour of large metabolic systems without requiring detailed
knowledge of the in vivo kinetics of each individual reaction.

2 FEATURES OF GRAPE

2.1 General features

GRaPe provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for
importing, creating, editing and exporting biological models in
SBML. GRaPe automatically integrates every metabolic reaction
with either an enzyme species or with a gene expression process
(Fig. 1). When only proteomic data is deﬁned in the SBML
document, GRaPe adopts the Reaction-Protein (RP) representation.
When transcriptomic data is given, GRaPe then adopts the Gene
Reaction-Protein (GRP) representation. Transcription, translation
and degradation of both mRNA and proteins are then expressed
mathematically.

GRaPe also provides functionality to manually construct GRP
and/or RP network models. In both model-building processes,
GRaPe automatically generates a Michaelis—Menten reversible rate
equation for each reaction based on its stoichiometry and enzyme
mechanism by iterating through the metabolic network. Each
reaction in the network can have up to two substrates and products.
See Supplementary Material 1 for the detailed list of rate equations
used by GRaPe.

GRaPe implements two robust methods, the Levenberg—
Marquardt method (LMA) and a genetic algorithm (GA), for
estimating kinetic parameters, in addition to the Steady-State
Enzyme Estimator (SSEE) method. See Section 3.3 for more
details about the estimation methods and their application. The two
parameter estimation methods attempt to ﬁnd the values of missing
kinetic parameters, given the experimental time series data. Both
methods work interchangeably so that when one method fails to
ﬁnd a suitable solution set (a low objective function) the other is
employed. The parameter set from the method that returns the best
objective function is then taken.

The time series data used as an input for all estimation methods
must be in a tab-delimited plain text ﬁle. GRaPe matches the
identiﬁers (ids) in the model to the ids in the data ﬁle during
parameter estimation and throws an error if any of the ids in the
model are not found in the input data. The data ﬁle for all parameter
estimation methods is the same; which means GRaPe treats the last
row of the data ﬁle as the steady-state data for the SSEE method.

GRIN GUI

Fig. 2. System architecture of GRaPe. The ‘Gene Expression” module takes
in the gene(s). mRNA and enzyme species of a reaction. Transcription.
translation and degradation of mRNA and enzyme are expressed in this
module. The ‘Reaction’ module constructs a reaction based on the number
of substrates. products and reaction mechanism. An ‘Integrative Model
Unit” module is then created from either ‘Gene Expression” or just the
enzyme species only and ‘Reaction” modules. These units are stored in
a list (‘Integrative Model List”) before being converted into a SBML
ﬁle by the Model2SBMLConvertor. The ‘Parameter Estimation” module
provides methods for estimating kinetic parameters in a model. SBML
ﬁles imported by GRaPe are disintegrated into separated units by the
SBML2ModelConvertor. The GUI serves as a platform for creating and
editing the model.

The time series data can correspond to experimental or simulated,
continuous dynamic or steady-state data.

The estimation procedure constrains parameters to experimental
data and therefore assignment of initial concentrations of species
must be the same in the model as in the experimental data. It is also
recommended that the precision of experimental values be limited to
two decimal places for faster estimation. The time taken to estimate
parameters for all reactions in a model is dependent on the amount
of input data. For dynamic time series data, the total estimation
time tends to take longer compared to steady-state time series data.
Although there is no limit to the number of data points in the input
data, large datasets increase estimation time.

2.2 System architecture

In order to make GRaPe platform independent and easy to use by
the biological community, Java was chosen as the programming
language. Figure 2 shows the architecture of GRaPe and the
interactions between the main components of the system. GRaPe
uses the J igCell Parser (Vass et al., 2004) for importing and exporting
SBML level 2 version 2 documents. Each reaction in the model
consists of its substrates, products and either the enzyme alone
or the full gene expression process of that reaction. The reactions
are stored in a list that later gets converted by the JigCell parser
into a SBML ﬁle. The inverse of this process can be achieved, i.e.
by parsing a SBML ﬁle that is then decomposed into reactions,
species/metabolites and enzymes.

3 METHODS

3.1 Modelling gene expression

Many methods have been used to model gene expression. which include
Boolean networks (Kim et al.. 2007; Li. 2007). differential equations (Chen
et al.. 1999). dynamic Bayesian networks (Kim et al.. 2003; Li. 2007)
and neural networks (Gagneur and Klamt. 2004). Boolean networks are
inexpensive with respect to computational complexity (D”haeseleer. 1999).
An advantage of Bayesian networks. like Boolean networks. is that they do
not require the explicit determination of kinetic parameters. However. both
methods are poor in capturing some important aspects of network dynamics
(Schlitt and Brazma. 2007).

We model gene expression using ordinary differential equations; this
enables details of the dynamics of the network to be captured by explicitly
modelling changes in concentrations of mRNA and proteins over time (Chen
et al.. 1999). Also. gene expression levels tend to be continuous rather
than discrete; discretization can lead to loss of information (D”haeseleer.
1999). Smolen at al. (2003) and Garcia-Martinez at al. (2007) studied
the relationship among variables that characterize gene expression at the
genome-level in living organisms. Their studies concluded that the amount
of both mRNA and proteins primarily depends on their transcription rate
(KTr). translation rate (Kn). mRNA concentration ([mRNA]) and protein
concentration ([Protein]).

We model the change in mRNA concentration over time as:

d ( [mRNA])

dz = VTRGBIIBU) - kaNADeg [mRNA] (1)

where [mRNA] is the mRNA concentration. vTR is the transcription or mRNA
synthesis rate. and kaNADCg is the mRNA degradation rate. Gene(t) is
an expression function which may take any real value. enabling external
regulators of gene expression to be incorporated into models. However. in
the examples presented here. no such regulation was included and these
values were taken to be Boolean. where a value of 1 indicated that the gene
was expressed and 0 otherwise.
The change in protein concentration over time is modelled as:

d([P])
dz

 

= le [mRNA] — kProteinDeg [Pl (2)

where [P] is the protein concentration. k-n. the protein synthesis or translation
rate. kprmeinDeg is the protein degradation rate and [mRNA]. the concentration
of mRNA. Both the equations (1) and (2) are based on ﬁrst order mass action
kinetics.

Methods have been developed to determine or estimate the synthesis and
degradation rates from microarray data (D”haeseleer. 1999; Wu et al.. 2004).
When these parameters are unknown. we present an alternative modelling
approach where only the protein level is integrated into the reaction instead of
the full gene expression process (Fig. 1b). The concentration of enzyme can
be set as ﬁxed over time or varied during simulation. This can be achieved
by the use of SBML ‘Events” that represent time-dependent changes within
the system. An event can be triggered if a certain condition is reached;
for example. set the concentration of enzyme ‘A” to 0.8 mM if time is
> 10min. Furthermore. the modelling framework enables the incorporation
of isoenzymes that can be modelled as individual enzyme species with their
own gene expression processes.

3.2 Enzyme kinetics and rate equations

GRaPe automatically generates a rate equation for a reaction in a network
based on the assumed enzyme mechanism governing that reaction. and its
number of products and substrates. The enzyme mechanism of a reaction
can either be of random order or compulsory order. If the binding order of
substrates and releasing order of products are unknown then the random-
order mechanism is recommended. The compulsory-order mechanism
requires the knowledge of the correct order of binding of substrates to the

Generic kinetic equations

 

proteins and releasing of products to be known. This mechanism proceeds
in an ordered series of steps. i.e. the substrate must bind in particular order
and the product is released in a speciﬁed order.

The automatic generation of generic rate equations is a key advantage of
GRaPe. This is time-efﬁcient and less error-prone for a relatively large model
compared to the manual deﬁnition of each rate equation by the user. COPASI
provides predeﬁned rate equations for reactions in a system. but these
equations must be manually assigned to reactions by the user and protein
levels cannot be explicitly assigned in rate equations. SBMLSqueezer is a
plug-in for CellDesigner. which generates rate equations for a biochemical
reaction (Drager. 2008); but the user has to manually select the type of rate
equation for each reaction in the network. and protein levels are not integrated
in rate equations. On a large scale. these solutions are impractical and leave
the model with unknown parameters.

GRaPe uses the King & Altman method (King and Altman. 1956) to
derive rate equations based on a reaction”s stoichiometry and the enzyme
mechanism under the steady-state assumptions. Supplementary Material 1
describes the generic MichaelisiMenten rate equations used by GRaPe for
the different reaction types. It generates kinetic rate equations for reactions
of up to two substrates or products. i.e. reactions can be of type unii
uni. uniibi. biiuni or biibi. A reaction of more than three substrates or
products needs to be decomposed into these reaction types based on its
biochemistry.

3.3 Parameter estimation

Kinetic models are shown to produce accurate and testable results. However.
the number of large-scale kinetic models has been very low due to the
enormous number of kinetic parameters needed to deﬁne the system.
Furthermore. as observed in Teusink et a1. (2000). in vitro measurements
of kinetic constants may not necessarily be representative of their numerical
values in viva (Jamshidi and Palsson. 2008). Various software tools can now
perform parameter estimation: COPASI has a list of methods for estimation
including a GA; SBML-PET (Zhike and Klipp. 2006) uses a stochastic
ranking evolution strategy method for parameter estimation; however. it
excludes constraints on the ﬂux of a reaction implying that a zero ﬂux
may be obtained even in non-equilibrium conditions. COPASI requires that
columns speciﬁed in the experimental data ﬁle must be associated with
model elements. Having a ﬂux for a reaction in the experimental data ﬁle
throws an error with COPASI. as ﬂuxes are not explicitly expressed in a
model.

While the exact values of kinetic parameters are not necessarily crucial to
determine the behaviour of a biochemical system. it is nevertheless necessary
to estimate the values of missing parameters in order to run simulations. In
GRaPe. we have introduced a simple but effective algorithm. the SSEE that
estimates the concentration of enzyme needed for a reaction to reach a steady
state. v. The SSEE algorithm focuses on solving for eo,the concentration of
the enzyme. by assigning all kinetic parameters in the models to a constant
value of 1. For a uniiuni reaction. 20 is calculated as follows:

6 v (1 + a +  (3)
0 (KAa—Kpp)
where KmA. Kmp. KA and K p are the kinetic parameter associated to substrate
A and product P. respectively. assigned a value of 1; a is the concentration of
substrate and p is the concentration of the product. SSEE allows for the rapid
simulation of steady-state behaviour in a system without prior knowledge of
kinetic parameters.

In addition. GRaPe implements two methods for parameter estimation
from time series of experimental data: the LMA and GA. The LMA is an
upgrade from Nocedal and Wright (1999). which was constrained to work
with our integrative models. GA is the predominant algorithm for estimating
kinetic parameters in GRaPe. However. when GA does not return a good
solution based on an objective function. then the LMA is used. GRaPe returns
the solution of the algorithm with the better objective function.

4 RESULTS

In this section, we present a generic model of yeast glycolysis
generated by GRaPe and compare its properties to a model
developed by Teusink et (11. (2000), which was based on an
experimental determination of kinetic parameters and rate equations.
The comparison is aimed at determining whether the behaviour
of such a metabolic system can be predicted without accurately
measuring the rate equations and detailed kinetics of every enzyme.

4.1 Case study: S.cerevisiae glycolytic pathway

We modelled the glycolysis pathway in S.cerevisi(1e using generic
rate equations and kinetic parameters estimated by GRaPe and
compared it to a detailed model by Teusink et (11. (2000). Since
the main objective of this work is to show that a generic kinetic
model can provide results of similar quality to a detailed model, we
compare our results with simulations of the Teusink model rather
than experimental values.

The yeast glycolysis pathway has been extensively studied
(Bakker et (11 ., 1997; Hynne et (11., 2001; Lambeth and Kushmerick,
2002; Pritchard and Kell, 2002; Teusink et (11., 2000) and a vast
amount of genomic and enzymatic data is therefore available.
In Teusink et (11. (2000), the authors examined whether in vivo
kinetics behaviour can be understood in terms of in vitro kinetics of
enzymes in yeast glycolysis. They produced two models, one where
branched reactions were ignored and a comprehensive model that
included all branched reactions. Their results suggested that half
of the enzymes matched their in vivo ﬂuxes within a factor of 2,
and the calculated deviation between in vivo and in vitro kinetic
characteristics of the other enzymes could explain discrepancy
between in vivo and in vitro kinetics. Fluxes and metabolites
concentrations were experimentally determined. Fluxes of trehalose
and glycogen were expressed in units of glucose, and kinetic
parameters were also determined under the same experimental
condition. The unbranched model used experimentally determined
metabolite concentrations and calculated conserved moieties but
no steady state was reached. The branched model, however,
reached a steady state with the original parameter set that had
been determined in vitro. Both models used a set of ordinary
differential equations to describe the time dependence of metabolite
concentration.

We modelled the glycolysis pathway of S.cerevisi(1e using GRaPe
based on the branched topology used by Teusink et (11. (2000). The
initial concentration of metabolites was the same as in the Teusink
model. The model includes all enzymes involved in the pathway
from glucose uptake to the production of pyruvate and ethanol. All
reactions were assumed to be of a random-order mechanism. GRaPe
then generated generic reversible rate equations for the reactions in
our glycolysis model, which were combined with the stoichiometry
of the network to produce ordinary differential equations. We made
three distinctive changes in our model. First, in the Teusink model,
a metabolic pool represented by an independent variable, P, was
deﬁned to represent the sum of high-energy phosphate in adenine
nucleotides. In our model, an equation is used for the conservation
of adenine nucleotides moiety as:

d[ADP] _ _ d[ATP]

dz dz (4)

D.A.Adiamah et al.

 

where [ADP] and [ATP] are the concentration of adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), respectively
and t is the time.

Secondly, since adenosine monophosphate (AMP) does not
partake in any reaction, we excluded the adenylate kinase reaction.
Thirdly, in the Teusink model the triosephosphate isomerase (TPI)
reaction was modelled using an equilibrium equation such that the
ratio of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) to glycerone phosphate
(DHAP) was at equilibrium. An independent variable, TrioZ-P, was
introduced, which was the sum of the concentration of GAP and
DHAP. In our model, we included the TPI reaction and modelled the
change in DHAP and GAP concentrations using uni—uni reversible
rate equation. These changes make it possible to study the effects
of varying the concentration of ATP, ADP, DHAP and GAP on the
system. The initial concentration of all metabolites was then assigned
using data given in the Teusink model. The concentrations of ATP
and ADP were calculated based on conserved moiety equations given
in Teusink et (11. (2000). As cofactors play an important part in the
global regulation of glycolysis, their concentrations were treated
as free metabolic variables. The kinetic equation for each reaction
was generated automatically by GRaPe based on the number of
substrates and products and the enzyme mechanism of the reaction.
Our glycolysis model in Figure 3 contains 23 metabolites (22; here,
the bracketed data corresponds to respective entity in the Teusink
model), 15 enzyme species (0), 116 kinetic parameters (88) and
18 ﬂuxes (17). A complete list of the ﬂux conversation equations
and abbreviations used in our model is provided in Supplementary
Material 2.

4.2 Data acquisition and parameter estimation

Using JWS online (Olivier and Snoep, 2004), a web tool for
simulating kinetic models, we collected steady-state data for the
Teusink model with glucose uptake concentrations of 10 and 50 leI.
These values were then merged to create our input dataset for
parameter estimation. The dataset contains values of all metabolite
concentrations and reaction ﬂuxes in the glycolysis pathway at every
10min; the glucose concentration was at 50mM from time 0 to
30 min and at 10 leI from 30 to 100 min; the precision of values was
limited to two decimals points for faster estimation. Next, GRaPe
was used to estimate the kinetic parameters for each reaction in
our model so that the distance between the input dataset and the
values calculated by the model was minimized. Due to the absence
of gene expression and enzyme amount data in this example, the
concentration of enzymes was set to a default value of 1 in both
the model and dataset for parameter estimation. GA was used to
estimate the kinetic parameters for each reaction after just one run
of estimation. The calculated error over our input data ranged from
4.5e-13 to 2.13e-10 for a reaction”s kinetic parameters set.

4.3 Experiment 1: model validation on training data

After parameter estimation was completed, the model was simulated
in CellDesigner using the SBML ODE Solver (SOSlib). The results
obtained from our simulations were then compared with results from
the Teusink model. The ﬁrst experiments were to verify whether
the model correctly reproduced the behaviour of the system at
steady state, without any perturbation, when glucose uptake is at
10 and 50 mM. Our results show a near-perfect agreement between
our model and the Teusink model (Tables 1 and 2). These results

conﬁrmed that the training and parameter estimation algorithms
successfully identiﬁed a solution, where the model reproduces the
correct concentration and ﬂux values used in the training data. The
dataset used for parameter estimation is provided in Supplementary
Material 3.

Using ‘events’ in SBML, we moreover replicated the effect
of a dynamically reduced uptake of glucose: after 30 min, the
concentration of glucose was reduced from the original 50 to 10 leI.
Results from this experiment (Fig. 4a—b) again show an excellent
agreement between our model and the Teusink model when the same
reduction in glucose uptake is applied. These results conﬁrm that the
integrity of our estimated parameters is conserved in a dynamic
experiment. Our model of glycolysis, with events for changing
the level of glucose uptake, has been provided in Supplementary
Material 4.

4.4 Experiment 2: model validation outside the
training range

The second experiment was carried out to verify how well the model
would predict a new state of the glycolysis pathway outside the range
of training data and without re-estimating the kinetic parameters. We
carried out simulations by changing the level of glucose to 1, 100
and 200 mM. The results, also shown in Tables 1 and 2, show an
excellent agreement between our model and the Teusink model with
glucose increased to 100 and 200 mM.

Our model still produced results with very low concentrations of
glucose (1 mM), while the Teusink model reported an error during
simulation when the glucose input was <2 mM. The generic model
thus appears to be more robust than the detailed model. We repeated
a dynamic experiment, changing the glucose concentration from 50
to 100mM after 30 min (Fig. 4c—d), which was again successful.
The results obtained from these experiments demonstrate the ability
of our generic model to predict new steady-state behaviours that
were not used for training. Overall, our results demonstrate that it
is possible to predict system behaviour using generic reversible rate
equations, without addressing detailed mechanisms at the level of
each component.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have introduced GRaPe, a platform-independent software tool
aimed at streamlining the construction of large-scale dynamic

models. GRaPe enables the automated construction of reaction-
protein or gene-reaction-protein networks. A novel feature of GRaPe
is its ability to generate generic rate equation for models of
relatively large sizes. Another important feature is its capability to
explicitly integrate gene expression processes or enzyme species
into reactions, making it a convenient tool for the construction of
integrative protein-reaction networks.

The current availability of high-throughput ﬂuxomic,
metabolomic, proteomic and genomic data makes it possible
to envisage building integrative genome-scale metabolic models,
but convenient tools for assembling such heterogeneous data on
a large scale are still lacking. An aim of systems biology is to
understand cellular processes as a whole rather than in isolation.
Integrating cellular components is essential for our understanding
of how interactions between these components inﬂuence cellular
functions. A few manually constructed integrative metabolic models
have now been created (Ao et (11., 2008; Forster and Palsson, 2003;
Jamshidi and Palsson, 2008); however, no computational tool
for integrating protein levels into metabolic models exists. The
integration of proteomics data into metabolic models could increase
our understanding of the role of enzymes on metabolism. Another
important feature of GRaPe is its ability to convert existing
metabolic models in SBML format into either gene-reaction or
gene-protein-reaction networks. This will enable, for example,
the import of high-throughput quantitative proteomics data into
metabolic models.

Our research ties in with previous investigations indicating that
the dynamic behaviour of metabolic systems can be predicted
without accurately measuring all rate equations and detailed kinetic
parameters. Ao et (11. (2008) have already used generic rate
equations to construct a metabolic model of M.extorquens AMl.
Their results showed that it is possible to attain the dynamical
behaviour of a system without the use of extensive and accurately
measured rate equations and kinetic parameters. GRaPe follows
this principle to enable the building of large models. It generates
generic rate equations for all reactions in a metabolic network,
and thus assumes that the global behaviour of a system should be
relatively independent of precise kinetic properties and parameter
values. It is worth noting that metabolic systems have long been
known to be robust to perturbations and maintain relatively stable
intracellular metabolite and ﬂux levels in response to changing
external conditions. This property was reﬂected by the Teusink
model, as we have shown in a previous study (Schwartz and
Kanehisa, 2006), and it is conserved in our generic model.

Parameter estimation (optimization) has become an area of
signiﬁcant importance in kinetic modelling due to the fact that it is
often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to measure vast
numbers of kinetic parameters experimentally. Some repositories
such as Sabio-RK (Rojas et (11., 2007) and BRENDA (Schomburg
et (11., 2002) store kinetic parameters and enzymatic information for
various pathways in different organisms.

However, it is difﬁcult to compare parameters of the same
pathway in different models due to different assumptions and

experimental conditions. Gutenkunst et (11. (2007) suggested that
modellers should focus on predicting the behaviour of the system
rather than parameters due to parameter ‘sloppiness’, meaning
that parameters are often poorly constrained. GRaPe introduces a
simple but effective method for estimating the amount of enzyme
concentration required to give a particular steady state. This method
enables analysis of the steady-state behaviour without detailed
knowledge of kinetic parameters. GRaPe also has two methods for
parameter estimation: the LMA algorithm and GA. Both methods are
robust and work interchangeably in estimating kinetic parameters.

The capability of GRaPe to convert reactions into ODEs based
on their stoichiometric matrix for small or large-scale networks, its
main innovation, makes it complementary to other existing software
tools. GRaPe is not designed to compete with well-developed
simulation softwares, but to complement existing applications by
providing an upstream solution for the efﬁcient design of large-
scale dynamic models. Models created using GRaPe can be run
using existing simulation tools such as CellDesigner, COPASI and
any other tools that support SBML. In the future, we aim to interface
GRaPe with existing databases of metabolic reactions and kinetic
parameters in order to make it capable of rapidly constructing large-
or genome-scale integrative kinetic models.

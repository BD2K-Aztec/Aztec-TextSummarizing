Abstract

Summary: Biological sequence databases are integral to efforts to characterize and understand
biological molecules and share biological data. However, when analyzing these data, scientists are
often left holding disparate biological currency—molecular identifiers from different databases. For
downstream applications that require converting the identifiers themselves, there are many re—
sources available, but analyzing associated loci and variants can be cumbersome if data is not
given in a form amenable to particular analyses. Here we present BISQUE, a web server and cus—
tomizable command—line tool for converting molecular identifiers and their contained loci and vari—
ants between different database conventions. BISQUE uses a graph traversal algorithm to general—
ize the conversion process for residues in the human genome, genes, transcripts and proteins,
allowing for conversion across classes of molecules and in all directions through an intuitive web
interface and a URL—based web service.

Availability and implementation: BISQUE is freely available via the web using any major web
browser (http://bisque.yulab.org/). Source code is available in a public GitHub repository (https://
github.com/hyulab/BISQUE).

1 Introduction

 

The proliferation of genomic and proteomic databases has helped us or-
ganize and understand biological molecules and phenomena, but has
left the scientific community using many different naming conventions
for the same, or intrinsically related biological entities: genes, proteins
and transcripts (Cunningham et (11., 2015; Gray et (11., 2015; Pruitt
et (11., 2014; UniProt—Consortium, 2015). While there are many tools to
convert the identifiers themselves, there are insufficient resources to con-
vert loci and variants annotated in reference to these identifiers
(Supplementary Table S1). Due to pervasive sequencing and variant an-
notation, this has led to a routine burden on biologists to convert from

one naming convention to another, and may lead to errors when build-
ing upon other labs’ research (McCarthy et (11., 2014).

Here we present BISQUE (The Eiological §eggence Exchange),
a multi-interface utility for converting human genomic, tran-
scriptomic and proteomic loci and variants from their reported form
into forms useful for downstream research. BISQUE is an extensible
conversion framework deployed as a web server (http://bisque.
yulab.org) for user-friendly conversion among the most popular
human database identifiers. It is also available as a programmatic
web service, downloadable as a customizable standalone application

external dependencies. The lite version contains all of the same func—
tionality as the full version, but relies on an internet connection to
access data from the public BISQUE MySQL database.

The command—line application is open source, written in Python
and importable as a Python module, providing users with another
avenue to incorporate BISQUE into their scripts. This also gives
more advanced users the ability to modify BISQUE to meet their
own needs, for instance to expand the coverage of database identi—
fiers available for conversion by adding and removing edges and
nodes from the conversion graph. For most new databases this is
achievable through included utilities and documentation, and may
not require modifying the code.

4 Discussion

While there are some tools available to perform limited conversion
of positions and variants associated with database identifiers
(Supplementary Table 1), these often exist as coupled conversion—
analysis tools, which lack the all—to—all conversion capability of
BISQUE. Furthermore, variant conversion is typically coupled with
much more computationally expensive functions, such as variant an—
notation. What is lacking in these tools is modularity—a core design
principle of complex systems that allows functional components to
be repurposed for other tasks. BISQUE embraces modularity in its
own internal structure through a generalized conversion framework,
which enables the expansion of its conversion capability. BISQUE is
also a module itself, with the ability to perform multiple conversions

for a scripting task or to act as the conversion engine for a data—
base or analysis tool. In this way, BISQUE will be very valuable to
the scientific community as it publicizes vital biological
infrastructure.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Understanding the mechanisms governing the regener-
ation capabilities of many organisms is a fundamental interest in biol-
ogy and medicine. An ever-increasing number of manipulation and
molecular experiments are attempting to discover a comprehensive
model for regeneration, with the planarian flatworm being one of the
most important model species. Despite much effort, no comprehen-
sive, constructive, mechanistic models exist yet, and it is now clear
that computational tools are needed to mine this huge dataset.
However, until now, there is no database of regenerative experiments,
and the current genotype—phenotype ontologies and databases are
based on textual descriptions, which are not understandable by com-
puters. To overcome these difficulties, we present here Planform
(Planarian formalization), a manually curated database and software
tool for planarian regenerative experiments, based on a mathematical
graph formalism. The database contains more than a thousand ex-
periments from the main publications in the planarian literature. The
software tool provides the user with a graphical interface to easily
interact with and mine the database. The presented system is a valu-
able resource for the regeneration community and, more importantly,
will pave the way for the application of novel artiﬁcial intelligence tools
to extract knowledge from this dataset.

1 INTRODUCTION

The main goal in regenerative biology is to ﬁnd the control
mechanisms that allow many organisms to regenerate missing
appendages or organs, including the brain. Planarian worms
are of special interest because, despite their complexity (they pos-
sess a brain, eyes, sensory and digestive systems, musculature,
etc.), they exhibit an outstanding regenerative capacity: cutting a
worm in many pieces results in a regenerated complete worm
from each piece (Reddien and sanchez Alvarado, 2004).
However, despite the current outstanding efforts of surgical,
pharmacological and molecular genetic experiments, no model
exist that can explain more than one or two aspects of planarian
regeneration (Lobo et al., 2012).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

What is needed now for the discovery of constructive, mech-
anistic and predictive models of regeneration are automated
computational tools and a centralized database that unambigu-
ously stores experimental assays and outcomes in a formal struc-
ture, permitting efficient retrieval of the developmental
knowledge acquired during >100 years of planarian experiments.
Certainly, the goals of true Systems Biology require the ability to
manipulate information about higher-order properties of pattern
control in addition to gene- and protein-level data.

Ontologies have been proposed to standardize the vocabulary
to describe phenotypes (Smith and Eppig, 2009) and are in use in
valuable databases linking genomic and phenotype data (Groth
et al., 2007). However, current phenotype ontologies are based in
well-defined textual descriptions, which are not adequate for re-
generation data and cannot be interpreted by automated
algorithms.

Here, we present a novel database based on a mathematical
graph formalism, which can describe unambiguously the geomet-
ric relations between morphological parts, and a computational
tool to mine and extract knowledge from this vast amount of
data from the regeneration ﬁeld.

2 METHODS

2.1 F ormalism for morphologies and manipulations

We have created a formalism based on graphs to encode the resultant
morphologies and manipulations of regenerative experiments (Lobo
et al., 2013). Mathematical graphs are ideal to encode relationships be-
tween individuals and have been previously used to encode morphologies
(Lobo et al., 2011). The formalism divided a morphology into adjacent
regions (graph nodes) connected to each other (graph edges). The geo-
metrical characteristics of the regions (connection angles, distances,
shapes, type, etc.) are stored as node and link labels. Importantly, the
formalism permits automatic comparisons between morphologies: we im-
plemented a metric to quantify the difference between two morphologies
based on the graph edit distance algorithm.

The experiment manipulations are encoded in a tree structure. Nodes
represent speciﬁc manipulations (cuts, irradiation and transplantations)
where links deﬁne the order and relations between manipulations. This
approach permits encode the majority of published planarian regenera-
tive experiments.

2.2 Database implementation and curation

The centralized database of planarian experiments was implemented
using the database engine SQLite (public domain). A database is con-
tained in a single file, which includes both the schema and the data. This
facilitates the access, extension and sharing of databases.

Planform: planarian formalization

 

The database contains experiments from articles in the literature
reporting the most fundamental discoveries in planarian pattern regener-
ation, including the regeneration along the anterioriposterior and
medialilateral axis under speciﬁc cuttings, amputations, transplantations,
irradiation, drugs and RNA interference (RNAi) treatments. Future ver-
sions of the database and software tool will be expanded to include spe-
ciﬁc cell types, gene expression and patterning along the dorsaliventral
ax1s.

2.3 Software implementation
Planform was implemented in C++ and compiled as a native
stand-alone desktop application for Microsoft Windows, Mac

OS X and Linux. Planform can create, read and write planarian database
ﬁles.

3 RESULTS

At the time of writing, the centralized database contains 1139
experiments manually curated from 74 publications from the
scientiﬁc literature, and we are continually expanding it.

Figure 1 shows screenshots of Planform. The main window
lists all the experiments, manipulation, morphologies, drugs,
RNAi, species and publications stored in the database
(Fig. 1A). A form is used to introduce the characteristics of
an experiment (publication, drugs, manipulation, resultant
morphologies, etc.); these characteristics can be selected from
the database if they are similar to previously introduced experi-
ments, or deﬁned anew (Fig. 1B). An experiment can deﬁne sev-
eral different morphological outcomes, depending on the
penetrance of the treatment and the elapsed regeneration time.

including its details, procedure, manipulation, and resultant morpholo-
gies. (C) Interface to specify a morphology, based on an interactive graph
representation and an automatically-generated cartoon. (D) Interface to
specify a manipulation, defined as a hierarchy of elemental actions

To facilitate the interpretation of the formalism by the user,
Planform draws cartoon representations of the formal morphol-
ogies and manipulations in real time, so that the user can imme-
diately see a schematic of the phenotype being described. To
introduce new morphologies (Fig. 1C) and manipulations
(Fig. 1D), the tool presents an interactive graphical represen-
tation, which permits one to drag vertices and parameters, as
well as to create and delete regions/organs, and perform other
edits. The user can introduce a new morphology or manipulation
by starting from scratch or by copying and editing an existing
one.

Importantly, Planform includes a search module that permits
a scientist to query for experiments, worm manipulations, regen-
erated morphologies, etc. stored in the database. A query is
deﬁned by the type of entity to search (experiments, manipula-
tions, morphologies, drugs, RNAi, species or publications), a
characteristic to search for (name, publication title or year,
drug or RNAi names or number of speciﬁc organs or regions),
a comparator operator (contains, equal, less or greater) and a free
text with which to compare the operator. In this way, any scien-
tist can easily ﬁnd specific results contained in the database
according to a familiar criterion.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The continued expansion of experimental results in pattern
formation necessitates the development of computational tools
to help derive insight from data. Planform is the first database
specialized on regenerative experiments, which centralize in a
clear and mathematical manner the current knowledge of plan-
arian regeneration. It uses a novel formalization ontology based
on graph representations of morphologies and manipulations,
which are amenable to automated computational analysis. This
represents the beginnings of an expert system that can encapsu-
late the field’s sum total of functional knowledge about worm
patterning and its experimental manipulation. We also imple-
mented a software tool to facilitate the query, input and search
of information in the centralized database of planarian
experiments. While this system is meant to facilitate the under-
standing of planarian regeneration, it is important to keep
in mind that the fundamental principles are generally applic-
able to many model systems and all aspects of developmental
biology.

The database centralizing the planarian experimental know-
ledge combined with the software tool Planform together repre-
sent an invaluable new kind of bioinformatics toolia first step
towards expert systems that store and process the combined
knowledge of the developmental and regenerative research
communities.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Constraint-based modeling of genome-scale metabolic
networks has been successfully used in numerous applications such
as prediction of gene essentiality and metabolic engineering. We
present SurreyFBA, which provides constraint-based simulations
and network map visualization in a free, stand-alone software. In
addition to basic simulation protocols, the tool also implements the
analysis of minimal substrate and product sets, which is useful for
metabolic engineering and prediction of nutritional requirements in
complex in vivo environments, but not available in other commonly
used programs. The SurreyFBA is based on a command line
interface to the GLPK solver distributed as binary and source
code for the three major operating systems. The command line
tool, implemented in C++, is easily executed within scripting
languages used in the bioinformatics community and provides
efficient implementation of tasks requiring iterative calls to the
linear programming solver. SurreyFBA includes JyMet, a graphics
user interface allowing spreadsheet-based model presentation,
visualization of numerical results on metabolic networks represented
in the Petri net convention, as well as in charts and plots.
Availability: SurreyFBA is distributed under GNU GPL license and
available from http://sysbio3.fhms.surrey.ac.uk/SurreyFBA.zip.

1 INTRODUCTION

An understanding of how cellular phenotypes emerge from
interactions between molecular parts, encoded in the genome,
requires computer simulation of genome-scale molecular interaction
networks. Due to the scarcity of quantitative information, these
simulations have been limited to the special case of metabolic
networks operating under quasi-steady state, which is modeled by
a set of linear relationships between reaction ﬂuxes. The model is
explored by employing Linear Programming optimization, where
the optimal ﬂux toward any reaction or substance in the model
can be determined. This approach is referred to as constraint based
(Price et (11., 2004), because it evaluates metabolic capabilities under
the set of constraints representing stoichiometry, maximal capacity
and reversibility of the reactions. This information can be obtained
for a particular repertoire of enzymatic activities, predicted from

the genome, which has permitted reconstruction of genome-scale
metabolic reaction networks (GSMNs) for major model organisms,
pathogens, industrial microorganisms and humans. The review of
the numerous applications of GSMNs is beyond the scope of this
article. The software presented here stemmed from our work on
metabolic engineering (Khannapho et (11., 2008) and prediction of
gene essentiality in pathogens (Beste et (11., 2007).

Constraint-based simulations are implemented in the COBRA
toolbox (Alexandrescu et (11., 2007) running under the Matlab
environment. The SimPheny software (www.genomatica.com)
is a commercial solution with a database backend providing
visualization of numerical results on pathway maps. Visualization is
also available in the FBA-SimViz (Grafahrend-Belau et (11., 2009)
and MetaFluxNet (Lee et (11., 2003) programs, although none of them
implements iterative simulations such as ﬂux variability analysis
(FVA) or reaction essentiality scans.

Here we present SurreyFBA, a GNU GPL software for constraint-
based simulations of metabolic reaction networks. In addition to
the standard methods, available in existing tools, it implements
analysis of minimal substrate and product sets. The command line
tool is available as a binary and source code for Linux, Windows
and MacOS systems and can be used without dependencies on
mathematical modeling environments. It can be easily run using
common scripting languages, which makes it particularly suitable
for the integration with bioinformatics analysis pipelines. We have
already implemented J yMet, a Jython graphics user interface, which
provides visualization of networks and numerical results, integrated
into network diagrams.

2 SOFTWARE

The SurreyFBA is a metabolic modeling interface to the Gnu
Linear Programming Kit (www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html),
distributed within the software. The calculations involving linear
programming (LP) are implemented in C++ as an object-oriented
LP kernel, which is initialized once and used repeatedly in iterative
algorithms, while the objective function and the linear constraints
are modiﬁed. This increases performance in applications such as
FVA and essentiality scans involving thousands of LP solutions.
An additional gain in performance can be achieved by applying the
optional matrix reduction algorithm (M.G. Poolman, unpublished).
For example, SurreyFBA is 41% faster than COBRA toolbox on
FVA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae iND750 model. In the current
distribution, we also provide JyMet—a desktop graphics user
interface written in Jython. JyMet presents model structure in a

user friendly spreadsheet and provides a menu-based interface to
simulation methods (Fig. l).

A model can be provided either in a tab-delimited format deﬁning
reactions only or in a more extended four-level format describing
also genes, enzymes and metabolites. JyMet can also import SBML
ﬁles that conform to the conventions accepted by the COBRA
Toolbox. A separate text ﬁle may be provided with one or more
problem deﬁnitions in a simple scripting format, including objective
functions, redeﬁned ﬂux bounds, method-speciﬁc arguments and
additional linear constraints. The results are written in a tabular
format.

SurreyFBA implements established metabolic modeling methods,
such as ﬂux balance analysis, ﬂux variability analysis, robustness
analysis, phenotypical phase planes (Price et (11., 2004), elementary
mode analysis (Heinrich and Schuster, 1996), essentiality scans and
prediction of reaction and gene/enzyme knockout results (involving
the evaluation of logical rules relating reactions to genes or
enzymes). It also provides some structural methods for model
validation, such as detection of live reactions, orphan metabolites
(Poolman et (11., 2006), unconserved metabolites (Gevorgyan
et (11., 2008) and connected components. Original methods are
provided for the calculation of minimal substrate and product sets
(Gevorgyan, 2009), enabling quick and concise characterization of
nutritional requirements and metabolic capabilities of the organisms
investigated.

A model or results can be visualized in JyMet on network
maps using Petri net convention, with automatically generated and
manually editable layouts. Dedicated ﬁinctions are also provided for
showing simulation results in charts and plots.

3 CONCLUSIONS

The free SurreyFBA software provides a command line tool
efﬁciently implementing a large number of constraint-based

modeling approaches, including methods that are not available in
other tools. It is an ideal choice for users integrating constraint-
based simulations with bioinformatics pipelines, and also provides
a user-friendly graphical interface independent on commercial
mathematical modeling environments.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Scientists, educators and the general public often need
to know times of divergence between species. But they rarely can
locate that information because it is buried in the scientific literature,
usually in a format that is inaccessible to text search engines. We
have developed a public knowledgebase that enables data-driven
access to the collection of peer-reviewed publications in molecular
evolution and phylogenetics that have reported estimates of time
of divergence between species. Users can query the TimeTree
resource by providing two names of organisms (common or scientific)
that can correspond to species or groups of species. The current
TimeTree web resource (T imeTree2) contains timetrees reported
from molecular clock analyses in 910 published studies and 17341
species that span the diversity of life. TimeTree2 interprets complex
and hierarchical data from these studies for each user query, which
can be launched using an iPhone application, in addition to the
website. Published time estimates are now readily accessible to the
scientific community, K—12 and college educators, and the general
public, without requiring knowledge of evolutionary nomenclature.
Availability: TimeTree2 is accessible from the URL
http://www.timetree.org, with an iPhone app available from iTunes
(http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timetree/id372842500?mt=8) and a
YouTu be tutorial (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meshZQciwo).

Molecular Clocks have emerged as an important tool for timing the
origin and divergence of species. This is because a vast majority of
species and their ancestors have left little or no traces in the fossil
record. Furthermore, the addressing of many biological questions
(e.g. origin of life and eukaryotes, colonization of land by plants
and fungi, and radiation of mammals) requires the knowledge of
time of divergence (Avise 2009; Hedges and Kumar, 2009; Kumar,
2005). The increasing utility of molecular Clocks is reﬂected in the
increasing numbers of publications each year that report species
divergence times using molecular data (Fig. 1). This has been driven
by the development of methods that accommodate rate variation
in estimating divergence times and their conﬁdence intervals as
well as the ease of sequence data generation owing to advances
in sequence technologies (Battistuzzi et al., 2010; Drummond et al.,
2006; Hedges and Kumar, 2009).

Fig. 1. Growth in the number of publications per year reporting molecular
clock based estimates of species divergence times. Potentially relevant
publications (>19 000) were retrieved from Google Scholar (March.
2011) by using the query: (“molecular clock” OR “divergence time” OR
“divergence times” OR “molecular time” OR “molecular divergence” OR
“molecular date” OR “molecular dates” OR “divergence dates”) NOT
(circadian OR disorder OR periodicity). A randomly selected subset of 20
publications was examined for each year to generate the estimated numbers
of relevant publications. We expect these numbers to be minimums because
our search strings will not produce all relevant articles.

Scientists and non-scientists frequently need to know when two
species diverged in geologic time. Beyond that basic information,
many wish to know if there is a consensus in the expert scientiﬁc
community regarding the average or range of published times, and
relevant publications. Answers cannot be generated by text mining
the corpus of published literature (e.g. Google search). This is
because the primary information on species and divergence times
is in evolutionary trees that (i) appear in graphical formats (images)
and (ii) contain hierarchical information among species, neither of
which is accessible in text searches.

For this reason, we have developed a professional resource in
which divergence times reported in the form of phylogenetic trees
scaled to time (timetrees), in tables, and in the regular text in 910
studies have been collected in a relational database of hierarchical
(tree) data. These data, gathered by visual inspection of articles and
by author-submitted data ﬁles, encompass 17 341 species among all
major groups of life and include expert reports from a consortium of
102 scientists (http://www.timetree.org/consortium.php) in addition
to individual studies. This new release advances our earlier prototype
resource, which contained data from 70 studies with taxonomic
scope limited to tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds)
(Hedges et al., 2006). In addition to database expansion in terms of
studies and species diversity, we have also developed a completely
new application for Apple’s iPhone (and compatible devices) in
order to make the knowledgebase available to a greater diversity of

potential users and for easier and ready access beyond the classical
website view alone.

To use TimeTree2 for the iPhone, a user opens the app and is
presented with a form for entering the names of two organisms of
interest (Fig. 2A). The user then taps the ‘search’ button to initialize
the search. TimeTree ﬁrst uses a synonym list (from NCBI) to
translate from many common names and any ambiguities among
the query names are resolved by presenting the user with a choice
between possible matches. Then, the two most-inclusive groups
containing the query organisms are identiﬁed, and all published
studies included in the TimeTree repository are scanned for taxa
pairs across groups to ﬁnd all published times of divergence for the
evolutionary split (Hedges et al., 2006).

The results of a query return the divergence time (average
weighted by number of genes) for the organisms of interest (Fig. 2B).
Times from individual studies are marked with a dot along a
geological timescale to show the diversity of time estimates relating
to the user query (Fig. 2B). By tapping on a marker, a user can
navigate to more detailed information for the published study,
including the names of taxa used in the study, gene type, divergence
time, number of genes, data type (nucleotide or amino acid), author,
publication title and source of information within the article (e.g.
the speciﬁc table or ﬁgure) (Fig. 2C).

A Summary page is also available to the users (Fig. 2D), which
shows more detailed information on the user-query, including
the expert time estimates, if applicable, from The Timetree of
Life (Hedges and Kumar, 2009). As an added feature, users can
conveniently send query results via email. This feature also enables
scientists to generate alternative summary statistics if they desire.

In summary, TimeTree resource has now matured to contain a
substantial number of published studies, with studies being added
at a steady pace over time. After release of TimeTree2, the rate
of queries increased more than 10-fold, now surpassing 20000
per month, with 60% coming from iPhones. This demonstrates
that scientists at large and the general public are interested in the
knowledge of species divergence times and use it when it is served
in an accessible tool. Furthermore, providing access to scientiﬁc
resources on new media (e.g. iPhone) decreases latent barriers and
ampliﬁes the usage of scientiﬁc information, as the iPhone app is

currently being downloaded >1400 times each month. TimeTree
already is being used by K—12 educators (Metzger, 2011) and we
anticipate increased use in the education sector as the knowledgebase
expands and graphical user interface is reﬁned.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Contact maps are a valuable visualization tool in
structural biology. They are a convenient way to display proteins
in two dimensions and to quickly identify structural features such
as domain architecture, secondary structure and contact clusters.
We developed a tool called CMView which integrates rich contact
map analysis with 3D visualization using PyMol. Our tool provides
functions for contact map calculation from structure, basic editing,
visualization in contact map and 3D space and structural comparison
with different built-in alignment methods. A unique feature is
the interactive refinement of structural alignments based on user
selected substructures.

Availability: CMView is freely available for Linux, Windows
and MacOS. The software and a comprehensive manual can
be downloaded from http://www.bioinformatics.org/cmview/. The

1 INTRODUCTION

The tertiary structure of a protein is determined by non-covalent
residue interactions. An all-atom distance map is a lossless
representation of the 3D coordinates (save chirality). Distance data
can be further reduced to a binary residue contact map while still
allowing complete reconstructions within 2A RMSD (Duarte et (11.,
2010). The native fold is retained in reconstructions using sparse
subsets comprising as low as 10% of native contacts (Sathyapriya
et (11., 2009). Contact maps are a convenient way to highlight
structural features like domain architecture, secondary structure
and contact Clusters and they display unique information about
the sequence separation of contacting residues which is not easily
visible in 3D representations. The study of contact maps has been a
valuable source of insight in experimental and computational protein
structure analysis. They have for example been used to measure
the dissimilarity of structures (Caprara et al., 2004), to analyze
protein—protein interaction patterns (de Melo et (11., 2007) and to
study protein folding (Vendruscolo and Domany, 2000). Here we
present a tool which combines the strengths of contact map and 3D
visualization for protein analysis.

CM View implements several new features while seamlessly
combining the functionality of different contact map visualization
programs already developed. Among those, Structer+Dotter
(Sonnhammer and Wooton, 1998) contains modules for the
generation (Structer) and simple visualization (Dotter) of distance
maps and contact maps from PDB ﬁles. SeqX (Biro and Fordos,
2005) integrates frequency counts of residue combinations. With
ProtmapZD (Pietal et al., 2007) and Con-StructMap (Chung et (11.,
2007) contact maps of two conformations can be compared side-by-
side. Con-StructMap also allows to compare non-sequence-identical
proteins by loading an alignment from a ﬁle.

2 CMVIEW FEATURES

CMView is a stand-alone Java application for interactive
visualization, analysis and manipulation of protein contact maps.
It integrates protein analysis in contact map and 3D space via an
interface to the molecular viewer PyMol (DeLano, 2002). CMView
is open source software licensed under the GNU General Public
License (GPL). It is available for Mac OS X, Linux, Windows and
other platforms supporting Java 6.

Contact information can be read from various sources and ﬁle
formats (PDB, CASP TS, CASP RR, native CSV) either from local
ﬁles or directly from the PDB website. The contact deﬁnition can be
speciﬁed in terms of contact type (all-atom, C-a, C-5) and contact
threshold (distance cutoff in A). The main application window
(Fig. 1, right) shows the contact map and the various menu options
for editing and analysis. If 3D coordinates are provided, the structure
will be shown in a separate PyMol window (Fig. 1, left), making the
full set of advanced visualization features of PyMol available. Any
selection of (several) contacts can be exported as a corresponding
PyMOL selection. In addition, the two views are intimately linked:
the current residue pair underneath the crosshair in the 2D map
is continuously displayed as an edge annotated with the euclidian
distance in the 3D scene. The distance map, contact density and
triangle inequality relations (here called common neighborhoods)
are available as colored overlays in the contact map window.

2.1 Selecting, editing and export

CM View offers various functions to manipulate the contact map.
Contacts can be selected individually or by using rectangle select, ﬁll
select, diagonal select and neighbor select tools that resemble similar
functions known from graphics applications. Entire sets of contacts
can be deleted or highlighted in different colors and exported to the

3D structure. The option to toggle individual contacts gives full user
control in editing the map.

As an additional feature, CMView implements the Cone-Peeling
Algorithm (Sathyapriya et (11., 2009), which computes a fast
approximation of an essential subset of contacts sufﬁcient to
maintain the native fold when reconstructing the 3D structure using
distance geometry. Export options include text ﬁles in CASP RR or
native CSV format for further processing. The map visualization,
including highlighted contacts, can be exported as a PNG image.

2.2 Pairwise comparison

A key feature of CMView is the pairwise structural comparison of
two proteins or conformations. For this purpose, a second structure
can be loaded and aligned via one of the following methods:
Needleman-Wunsch sequence alignment (Moustafa, 2007), SADP
contact-based structural alignment (Jain and Lappe, 2007) or Dali
structural alignment (Holm and Sander, 1995). The comparison
View allows quick identiﬁcation of shared and unique contacts.
Common contacts are shown in black and contacts that are unique
to one structure are shown in pink (for the ﬁrst structure, e.g. a
predicted structure) and green (for the second structure, e.g. the
native structure). The two structures are also superimposed in the
PyMol window, doing a best ﬁt on the residues that are in contact
in both structures. The 3D alignment can be interactively reﬁned by
selecting contacts and recalculating the superposition based on this
subset. This feature allows the comparison of different alignments
based on shared substructures in cases where a global rigid-body
alignment is not optimal. To our knowledge, CMView is the only
application that allows such an alignment of substructures in an
interactive fashion.

3 CONCLUSION

CMView combines the strengths of rich contact map analysis with
traditional 3D visualization in a single application. As a tool for
contact map generation, modiﬁcation and analysis it is the most

feature complete application to date. Special emphasis has been
put on integrating tools for the analysis of secondary structure
interaction patterns and for the pairwise comparison of structural
models or related proteins. In particular, structural alignments can
be interactively reﬁned based on different subsets of shared contacts.
The real-time link of the current position in the 2D contact map
with highlighting the corresponding residue pair in the structure
provides a combined ’2D/3D-cursor’. This offers a more intuitive
approach to explore the relationships between contact patterns and
protein structure. These unique features make CMView a valuable
tool for structural analysis, protein modeling, assessment of structure
predictions and education in structural biology.

4 FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Future work will include full integration of a reconstruction engine
to transform modiﬁed contact maps back into 3D structures. This
will allow CMView to be used as an interactive, contact-based
protein modeling tool. An experimental command line tool called
’reconstruct’ which allows such 3D reconstructions via an interface
to a distance geometry package is already available for download
from the CMView website. Preview snapshots of ﬁiture versions
will be available from the authors upon request.

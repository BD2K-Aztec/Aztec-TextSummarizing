ABSTRACT

Motivation: There is a growing number of studies generating matched
Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 and gene expression data,
yet there is a corresponding shortage of statistical tools aimed at
their integrative analysis. Such integrative tools are important for the
discovery of epigenetically regulated gene modules or molecular path-
ways, which play key roles in cellular differentiation and disease.
Results: Here, we present a novel functional supervised algorithm,
called Functional Epigenetic Modules (FEM), for the integrative ana-
lysis of Infinium 450k DNA methylation and matched or unmatched
gene expression data. The algorithm identifies gene modules of coor-
dinated differential methylation and differential expression in the
context of a human interactome. We validate the FEM algorithm on
simulated and real data, demonstrating how it successfully retrieves
an epigenetically deregulated gene, previously known to drive endo-
metrial cancer development. Importantly, in the same cancer, FEM
identified a novel epigenetically deregulated hotspot, directly up-
stream of the well-known progesterone receptor tumour suppressor
pathway. In the context of cellular differentiation, FEM successfully
identifies known endothelial cell subtype-specific gene expression
markers, as well as a novel gene module whose overexpression
in blood endothelial cells is mediated by DNA hypomethylation. The
systems-level integrative framework presented here could be used to
identify novel key genes or signalling pathways, which drive cellular
differentiation or disease through an underlying epigenetic
mechanism.

1 INTRODUCTION

Epigenetic mechanisms are important not only in cellular differ-
entiation (Ziller et al., 2013) but also in disease (Petronis, 2010),
especially cancer (Feinberg et al., 2006). Among the epigenetic

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed

modiﬁcations seen in disease, DNA methylation (DNAm) is
especially important for two reasons. First, unlike other epigen-
etic modiﬁcations such as histone marks, it is possible to measure
genome-wide DNAm profiles in large numbers of samples
(Sandoval et al., 2011), including fresh-frozen and formalin-
fixed parafﬁn-embedded clinical tissue specimens (Lechner
et al., 2013). Second, there is mounting evidence that DNAm
aberrations can either predispose to or cause disease progression
(Feinberg et al., 2006; Issa et al., 1994; Jones et al., 2013;
Teschendorff et al., 2012; Ziller et al., 2013). Such causal inﬂu-
ences have been shown to be mediated by corresponding changes
in gene expression (Jones et al., 2013). Thus, DNAm has
emerged as the ‘epigenetic marker’ of choice in epigenome-wide
association studies (Rakyan et al., 2011) and in The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies that generate matched gene ex-
pression data (Kandoth et al., 2013). Speciﬁcally, the Illumina
Infinium 450k DNAm beadarray has emerged as a popular
choice offering both scalability and coverage at a reasonable
economic cost (Sandoval et al., 2011). Thus, there is now
an urgent need to develop statistical bioinformatic tools for the
integrative analysis of Illumina Infinium 450k and gene
expression data.

Here we present the Functional Epigenetic Module (FEM)
algorithm for integrative analysis of Illumina Infinium 450k
data with matched (or unmatched) gene expression data. The
FEM algorithm performs a supervised analysis using a pro-
teiniprotein interaction (PPI) network (Cerami et al., 2011) as
a scaffold to identify gene modules or signalling pathways which
are epigenetically and functionally deregulated in a cellular
phenotype. Supervised functional network analyses have been
used extensively in the gene expression context, see e.g.
Chuang et al. (2007). We have also previously demonstrated
the feasibility of integrating Illumina Inﬁnium 27k DNAm
data with a PPI, identifying key signalling pathways and gene
modules undergoing age-associated changes in DNA methyla-
tion, which were then validated in independent data (West
et al., 2013). Similarly, we also recently demonstrated the feasi-
bility and power of integrating Illumina Infinium 27k DNAm
data with gene expression and a PPI, identifying an epigenetically
deregulated gene, called HAND2, which drives endometrial
cancer (Jones et al., 2013). What these latter studies have

demonstrated is that PPI hotspots of differential methylation (i.e.
PPI subnetworks where a signiﬁcant number of members exhibit
statistically signiﬁcant differential methylation) associated with
ageing and cancer exist, and that further integration with gene
expression data allows the identiﬁcation of its putative target(s).
Given that the Illumina 27k technology has now been superseded
by the more comprehensive Illumina 450k platform, we were
impelled to extend our previous algorithm to the 450k case.
This extension, however, is non-trivial because for the Illumina
450k Methylation beadchip, there are typically many probes
mapping to a gene, and to different regions associated with the
gene, including distal transcription start site (TSS), proximal
TSS, 5/UTR, ﬁrst exon, gene body and 3/UTR. Thus, at present,
it is still unclear how best to summarize the DNAm values at the
gene level, especially in relation to its integration with matched or
unmatched gene expression data. Although the reported correl-
ations between Infinium 450k and gene expression data are not
strong, they are nevertheless highly statistically signiﬁcant
(Lechner et al., 2013), indicating that valuable information can
be extracted from such integrative analyses. To this end, we here
develop a novel integrative approach, especially designed for
Illumina 450k DNAm data, and validate this approach by
demonstrating that it can successfully retrieve known genes
and gene modules driving cellular differentiation or cancer.
The key aspect of our approach is the identiﬁcation of key
genes or gene modules, which are functionally deregulated as a
result of underlying DNAm changes.

2 METHODS

2.1 The FEM algorithm

The FEM algorithm is a functional supervised algorithm, which uses a
network of relations between genes (in our case a PPI network) to identify
subnetworks where a signiﬁcant number of genes are associated with a
phenotype of interest (POI). The association is measured at both the level
of DNAm and gene expression. The algorithm thus consists of two main
parts: (i) construction of an integrated network in which the associations
with the phenotype are encapsulated as weights on the network edges,
and (ii) inference of the FEMS as heavy subgraphs on this weighted
network.

2.1.] Integration of DNAm, mRNA expression and PP]
network The ﬁrst step in the algorithm is the integration of a
DNAm data matrix with gene expression and a PPI network. We
assume that the gene expression data represents normalized estimates
of gene expression intensity, summarized at the gene level, so this could
include RNA-Seq data or expression data generated using Illumina
Beadchips or Affymetrix arrays. The PPI network is derived from the
Pathway Commons resource (Cerami et al., 2011) and follows the pro-
cedure described by West et a]. (2013). The PPI network consists of 8434
genes annotated to NCBI Entrez identiﬁers and is sparse, containing
303 600 documented interactions (edges). When integrating with the
gene expression and DNAm data, we focus on the overlapping set of
genes and extract the maximally connected component deﬁned by this
overlapping set. To assign DNAm values to a given gene, in the case of
Illumina 27k data, we assigned the probe value closest to the TSS (Jones
et al., 2013; West et al., 2013). In the case of Illumina 450k data, we assign
to a gene the average value of probes mapping to within 200 bp of the
TSS. If no probes map to within 200 bp of the TSS, we use the average of
probes mapping to the ﬁrst exon of the gene. If such probes are also not
present, we use the average of probes mapping to within 1500 bp of the

TSS. Justiﬁcation for this procedure is provided later in Section 3. For
each gene g in the maximally connected subnetwork, we then derive a
statistic of association between its DNAm proﬁle and the P01, denoted
by [(0), as well as between its mRNA expression proﬁle and the same
POI, which we denote by téR). Here, these statistics are derived using an
empirical Bayesian framework and represent regularized t-statistics
(Smyth, 2004; Zhuang et al., 2012); however, the signed statistics tg
could derive from any appropriate statistical test (e.g. Wald statistics
from Cox regression or other types of regression). It is important to
also point out that because the integration is done at the level of statistics,
that there is no requirement for the mRNA and DNAm data to be
matched (i.e. to come from the same individuals). Indeed, the algorithm
works unchanged for the unmatched setting.

2.1.2 Construction of the weighted integrated network The key
idea is to encapsulate the associations of the genes with the P01 in
terms of the edge weights, to then identify hotspots of differential methy-
lation and differential expression as ‘heavy subnetworks’, i.e. subnet-
works where the edge weight density is significantly higher than in the
rest of the network. Before assigning weights to the network edges, the
statistics of one data type (e.g. DNAm) are ﬁrst scaled uniformly to
ensure equal variance between data types. That is, if 00 and 0,; denote
the SD of the statistics [20) and lg?) over all genes g, respectively, then we
scale all [(0) by a factor (IR/OD to ensure equal variance of the statistics
from each data type. This is done to avoid one data type overly biasing
the downstream inference procedure.

Because the DNAm data derive either from the TSS200, ﬁrst exon or
TSSlSOO regions and DNAm levels for these regions are normally anti-
correlated with gene expression (see Section 3), we assign an overall stat-
istic value of zero to those genes where the DNAm and expression stat-
istics are of equal sign. For those genes where there is the expected anti-
correlation, we use the absolute value, i.e. tg = ll?” — [gal All this can be
expressed more compactly as

tg = {H(t;D))H(—t;’”) + H(—t§D))H(t§R))}It§D) — th’I

where H(x) denotes the Heaviside function, deﬁned by H(x) = 1 Vx>0
and H(x) = 0 Vx < 0. We note that the statistics tg, as deﬁned, are always
positive or zero. Assuming genes g and h are connected in the PPI, we
then assign the edge weight as the average of the individual node (gene)
statistics, i.e. wgh = atg -I- th), which is positive semi-deﬁnite. We note that
this scheme may introduce zero-weighted edges, which would alter the
topology of the network. To avoid this mathematical nuisance, we
reassign zero-weighted edges with the smallest positive non-zero value
(typically this value is close to zero, i.e. ~0.001).

2.1.3 Inference of FEM A heavy subnetwork, or a module, is then a
subgraph where the average weight density, also called modularity, is
signiﬁcantly larger than in the rest of the network. Because the modular-
ity will be large if both the DNAm and mRNA expression statistics are
large for a signiﬁcant number of module members, we refer to such a
heavy subgraph as an FEM. To infer them, we use a local greedy version
of a spin-glass algorithm (Reichardt and Bornholdt, 2006) that we have
used previously (West et al., 2013). This local greedy version works by
specifying a number of seed nodes (genes) around which to search for
such modules. By default, the algorithm searches for modules around 100
seeds, deﬁned as the top 100 genes ranked according to the overall stat-
istic tg. A key parameter of the spin-glass algorithm, called y, controls the
average size of the resulting modules (West et al., 2013). By default, the
choice is y = 0.5, which typically leads to modules with an average size in
the range 10 to 100. As demonstrated by us previously, modules in this
size range are more likely to validate in independent data, and thus be of
biological signiﬁcance (West et al., 2013). Thus, assuming that seeds are
unifome distributed across the network, choosing 100 seeds amounts to
a search space of ~5000 to 10 000 nodes, i.e. most of the network.
However, we also note here again that not all seeds may lead to modules

(West et al., 2013) because a seed could represent an isolated node of
association with the POI. Therefore, in the case of many isolated nodes, it
is also advisable to rerun the algorithm with a larger number of seeds.

We note that the spin-glass algorithm infers subnetworks of relatively
high edge-weight density (in comparison with the average network edge-
weight density). This inference step takes the network topology into
account and could thus be overly biased towards specific topological
features. Therefore, it is also important to assess the statistical signiﬁ-
cance of the inferred modules, purely in relation to the DNAm and
mRNA expression associations. This is done using a Monte Carlo
(MC) randomization procedure, which permutes (1000 permutations)
the node statistics around the network and recomputes modularities for
the previously inferred modules. We note again that while the inference of
the modules depends on the topological features of the modules in rela-
tion to the whole network, the MC procedure provides an additional
signiﬁcance test, assessing signiﬁcance only in relation to the weights,
while keeping the network topology ﬁxed (West et al., 2013). Only mod-
ules that pass a false discovery rate MC signiﬁcance threshold of 0.05 are
deemed of statistical signiﬁcance.

2.1.4 Identiﬁcation of top targets within a FEM Once a FEM has
been identiﬁed, the top targets of the FEM are deﬁned as those genes
within the module with the largest values of tg. Clearly, for a FEM,
constructed from a given seed gene, one of the top targets will be seed
gene itself. However, for a module to be a FEM, there must be other
genes (besides the seed gene) that contribute signiﬁcantly to the observed
modularity.

2.1.5 The EpiMod algorithm It is clear that the algorithm can be run
in ‘DNA methylation only’ or ‘gene expression only’ modes, in which
case the statistics tg are deﬁned simply as |t§D)| or |t§R)|, respectively. In
the former case, we call it the EpiMod algorithm because it infers differ-
ential methylation hotspots. The EpiMod algorithm in the Illumina 27k
context was presented by us in West et a]. (2013).

2.2 Data

To assess correlations between Inﬁnium 450k DNAm and gene expres-
sion data, we used samples of normal physiology from TCGA.
Speciﬁcally, we analyzed 10 normal colon, 3 normal cervical and 17
normal endometrial samples for which matched level-3 Inﬁnium 450k
and HiSeq RSEM gene-normalized RNA-Seq data were available. To
validate the FEM algorithm on Illumina 450k data, we collected and
analyzed an additional 118 endometrial cancer samples with matched
RNA-Seq data from the same TCGA study proﬁling the 17 normal
endometrial samples (Kandoth et al., 2013). Integration of our PPI
network with the TCGA data described above resulted in a maximally
connected subnetwork of 6730 genes.

To test the FEM algorithm in the context of cellular differentiation we
analysed a matched Illumina 450k and Agilent gene expression dataset,
proﬁling blood and lymphatic endothelial cells (BECs and LECs, 16 sam-
ples) (Bronneke et al., 2012). Because endothelial cells exhibit a remark-
able plasticity and ease of transdifferentation, it is likely that epigenetic
mechanisms control cell subtype speciﬁcity (Bronneke et al., 2012).

In all cases, the DNAm 450k data were corrected for the type-2 probe
bias using BMIQ (Teschendorff et al., 2013).

2.3 Simulation

To assess the sensitivity (SE) and speciﬁcity (SP) of the FEM algorithm,
we used a simulation model, in which we simulated statistics of differen-
tial methylation and differential expression on the PPI network. As a true
module, we picked the HAND2 module because the biological and clin-
ical signiﬁcance of the driver gene, HAND2, contained within this
module, has been extensively validated (Jones et al., 2013). We boot-
strapped statistics for the member genes of this module to come from

the top and lower 5% statistics quantiles, with the statistics of the rest of
the network nodes bootstrapped from the middle 90% portion. For each
simulation run, the SE and SP of the FEM algorithm were recorded.
Here, SE was deﬁned as the fraction of HAND2 module members cap-
tured by the inferred FEM module, whereas SP was deﬁned as one minus
the false-positive rate.

3 RESULTS
3.1 DNAm values around TSS best predict gene
expression

Because with the Illumina Inﬁnium 450k beadarray, many
probes may map to a given gene (and to different regions asso-
ciated with the gene), we wanted to ﬁrst assess which probes are
most predictive of the gene expression state. To determine this,
we collected high-quality data from the TCGA representing sam-
ples of normal physiology, for which matched Inﬁnium 450k and
RNA-Seq data were available (Section 2). For each gene in each
sample, we averaged the DNAm ﬂ-Values of probes mapping
to the same gene region: these regions were deﬁned as 1500 bp
upstream of the TSS (TSS1500), 200bp upstream of the TSS
(TSS200), 5/UTR, first exon, gene body and 3/UTR. For a
given sample, and for each genetic region, DNAm values were
then binned into five levels. Boxplots of log-normalized RNA-
Seq counts against binned DNAm levels for each genetic region
in a given sample demonstrate that the strongest association (in
terms of R2 values) between DNAm and gene expression is for
the first exon and TSS200 regions, followed by TSS1500, all ex-
hibiting a relatively strong anti-correlation (R2 ~0.3, i.e Pearson
correlations of ~ — 0.5; Fig. 1A). This pattern was replicated in
each of 30 normal samples (ns) encompassing three different
tissue types, with ﬁrst exon, TSS200 and TSS1500 emerging
as the most predictive regions (Fig. 1B and Supplementary
Figs. S17S3). Owing to the differences in the degrees of freedom,
and hence to assess more objectively the three different regions,
we compared their predictive power by restricting to a common
pool of genes, specifically, those with probes mapping to each
one of these three regions. This unbiased analysis revealed that
TSS200 obtained marginally but consistently higher R2 and
t-statistic values compared with ﬁrst exon, and substantially
higher values compared with TSS1500 (Fig.1C and
Supplementary Fig. S4). Based on these results, we thus devised
the following scheme to assign a unique DNAm value to a given
gene: for a gene with TSS200 probes, the average DNAm of such
TSS200 probes was used. For a gene with no TSS200 probes but
with first exon probes, we assigned the corresponding average
over ﬁrst exon probes. Finally, for a gene with no TSS200 or ﬁrst
exon probes, we used the average over TSS1500 probes.

3.2 Validation of the EpiMod and FEM algorithms in
Illumina 450k endometrial cancer data

We previously demonstrated, using Illumina Infinium 27k data
from normal endometrial and endometrial cancer samples that
the interaction neighbourhood of the HAND2 gene represents a
differential methylation cancer hotspot (Jones et a1., 2013). By
using unmatched Affymetrix gene expression data, we further
demonstrated that this HAND2 module represented a hotspot
of differential methylation and differential expression, identifying

HAND2 itself as the key target (Jones et a1., 2013). Indeed, the
biological, functional and clinical importance of the HAND2
gene was further demonstrated by Jones et a1. (2013), where we
showed that it is causally implicated in the development of endo-
metrial cancer.

Thus, to validate our method of summarizing Illumina 450k
DNAm data at the gene level, we decided to apply the EpiMod
and FEM algorithms to an independent endometrial normal/
cancer Inﬁnium 450k set generated as part of the TCGA
(Section 2) (Kandoth et a1., 2013). Speciﬁcally, our aim was to
see if we could retrieve the HAND2 module, but now using 450k
data. In the first instance, we excluded the RNA-Seq data and
only used the EpiMod algorithm to identify differential methy-
lation hotspots associated with endometrial cancer (Section 2).
This resulted in 23 differential methylation hotspots, including
one centred around HAND2 (Supplementary Table S1), which
was also one of the top seeds. Thus, extension of the EpiMod
algorithm to the 450k case has indeed identiﬁed a module highly
similar to the one we inferred previously using independent
Illumina 27k data. Close inspection of the HAND2 module

conﬁrmed that many other genes in this module undergo differ-
ential methylation in cancer (Supplementary Table S2). Running
the FEM algorithm (i.e. including the matched RNA-Seq data)
identiﬁed 17 FEMs passing the significance threshold of 0.05,
and all with sizes in the range 10 to 59 (Supplementary
Table S3). A table summarizing the output of the algorithm
for 4 of the top 17 FEMs shows that one of the modules is
again centred around HAND2 (Table 1). Close inspection of
this module shows that HAND2 is the main gene that is func-
tionally deregulated, despite many other module genes being
deregulated at the DNAm level (Fig. 2 and Supplementary
Table S4). Specifically, HAND2 exhibited simultaneous hyper-
methylation and underexpression in cancer, as observed by us
previously using independent data (Jones et a1., 2013). Thus, we
can conclude that the extension of the FEM algorithm to the
450k case has successfully identiﬁed an epigenetically deregulated
gene module targeting a gene that has been demonstrated to
drive endometrial cancer development (Jones et a1., 2013).

While the FEM HAND2 module identiﬁed HAND2 as its
main target, other FEMs contained multiple putative targets,
for instance, the TGFBIII module (Tables 1 and 2). Thus, in
the same way that a copy-number aberration in cancer can
affect the gene expression levels of several genes within the
altered genomic region (Chin et a1., 2007), epigenetic changes
in cancer affecting functionally related genes may also affect
the gene expression of several targets. To conﬁrm the hotspot
nature and biological signiﬁcance of the TGFBIII module, we
sought to validate it in the independent endometrial normal/
cancer dataset considered by Jones et a1. (2013), which also
used different technologies (Illumina 27k for DNAm and
Affymetrix for mRNA expression). We observed that this same
module was a signiﬁcant FEM in this independent set, with the
top targets (TGFBIII and LIMS2) showing the same pattern of
coordinated hypermethylation and underexpression in cancer
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Interestingly, TGFBIII, also known
as HIC5, is a known co-activator of the progesterone receptor
(PGR) and has previously been implicated in endometriosis
(Aghajanova et al., 2009). Remarkably, given that HAND2 is a
target of PGR and that it mediates the tumour suppressive ef-
fects of progesterone (Jones et a1., 2013), it is entirely plausible
that silencing of HIC5 can have a similar effect by downregulat—
ing the PGR pathway.

3.3 The FEM algorithm identiﬁes DNA
methylation-regulated gene expression modules
associated with endothelial cell differentiation

As a second application of the FEM algorithm, we tested it in the
context of cellular differentiation. Speciﬁcally, we applied it to a
matched DNAm-mRNA expression dataset of endothelial cells
(Bronneke et a1., 2012), to identify hotspots of coordinated dif-
ferential methylation and differential expression between two
cellular subtypes: BECs and LECs. Transdifferentiation between
these two endothelial subtypes has been widely reported, with
DNAm emerging as a key regulator of this phenotypic plasticity
(Bronneke et a1., 2012). Thus, we decided to test the FEM algo-
rithm in its ability to retrieve genes or gene modules known
to mark LECs/BECs, but, importantly, to also identify novel
biologically plausible genes or gene modules that may determine
endothelial cell subtype speciﬁcity.

Running FEM with 300 seeds, we identiﬁed 41 FEMs contain-
ing at least ﬁve genes (Supplementary Table S5). Many of these
included or were centred around genes (e. g. BATF, 1L7, RTKN,
MAF, NRP2), which have been reported to be overexpressed in
LECs compared with BECs (Bronneke et a1., 2012). This list
also included PROX 1, a transcription factor required for LEC
differentiation (Amatschek et a1., 2007; Bronneke et a1., 2012).
Although many of these genes were reported to undergo DNAm
changes, these changes were mainly restricted to regions farther
away from the TSS (Bronneke et a1., 2012). This explains why in
our FEM analysis, which focuses mainly on the TSS200 region,
many of these genes showed more modest DNAm changes
(Supplementary Table S5). In spite of this, FEM was able to
capture these genes, owing to their signiﬁcant differential expres-
sion changes (Supplementary Table S5).

Most importantly, FEM identiﬁed a novel module mapping
to major histocompatability complex (MHC) genes, of which

several members (e.g HLA-DMB, HLA-DRBI, CD74, HLA-
DMA, HLA-DRB5) showed coordinated hypomethylation and
overexpression in blood endothelial relative to lymphatic cells
(Fig. 3 and Table 3). We note that these MHC genes were not
highlighted by Bronneke et a1. (2012), yet the biological plausi-
bility of this module is strongly supported by another study
(Amatschek et a1., 2007), which observed HLA-DRBI to be a
marker of BECs. As explained by Amatschek et a1. (2007), the
overexpression of these genes in BECs is likely to be triggered by
the tissue environment. Our FEM analysis further suggests that
DNAm plays a key intermediary role, regulating the overexpres-
sion of this speciﬁc MHC module in BECs.

Another example of an interesting novel module is that
centred around S TAT6, which we found to be hypomethylated
and overexpressed in BECs (Supplementary Table S5).
Overexpression of STA T6 in BECs relative to LECs is supported
by an independent study (Nelson et a1., 2007). Interestingly, sev-
eral other genes in the same module exhibited either significant
overexpression (e. g. IFI35, NMI) or differential methylation (e. g.
TH Y1 , AICDA). Most importantly, however, the FEM analysis
suggests that the observed overexpression of STAT6 may be
driven by hypomethylation of its promoter region.

3.4 Assessment of F EM’s operating characteristics

Although we have shown that FEM can successfully identify key
hotspots of differential methylation and expression, it is never-
theless still important to assess its overall operating characteris-
tics. To this end, we devised a realistic simulation model, using
the same real PPI network as a scaffold, and using the HAND2
module (11 genes) as an example of a realistic module. Statistics
of differential methylation and differential expression were
simulated, however, assigning larger values to the HAND2
module genes than for the other nodes in the network (see
Section 2). This simulation thus allows the sensitivity (SE) of
the inference procedure to be assessed. We performed 100 simu-
lations, recording the SE, speciﬁcity (SP) and positive predictive
value (Fig. 4). The mean SP and SE (0.79) were high, although in

that in the majority of runs, the algorithm can identify most

4 DISCUSSION

We have presented a novel algorithm for integrative functional
supervised analyses of Illumina 450k DNAm and gene expres-
sion data. By applying and testing it in two different biological
contexts, we have demonstrated here the feasibility of integrating
Illumina 450k data with gene expression in a systems context,
using a human protein interaction network as a scaffold to iden-
tify gene modules whose differential expression is regulated by
differential methylation. In an application to cancer, we have
seen how it successfully retrieved an epigenetically deregulated
gene module centred around (HAND2), a gene known to mediate
the tumour suppressive effects of the PGR pathway (Jones et al.,
2013). Speciﬁcally, silencing of HAND2 inactivates this tumour
suppressor pathway. It is therefore remarkable that FEM iden-
tiﬁed another hotspot and target gene (TGFBIII) implicated in
the PGR pathway. Our data suggest that hypermethylation-
mediated silencing of TGFBIII could also lead to downregula-
tion of the PGR tumour suppressor pathway because TGFBI 11
(HIC5) is a known co-activator of PGR (Aghajanova et al.,
2009). Importantly, the TGFBIII module was validated in inde-
pendent data, further supporting its biological signiﬁcance. In
the context of endothelial cell differentiation, we have shown
how FEM retrieved known markers of endothelial cell subtypes,
including an MHC gene module hypomethylated and overex-
pressed in BECs. Likewise, it identiﬁed DNA hypomethylation
as the potential mechanism underlying STAT6’s overexpression
in BECs. That the overexpression of the MHC module genes and
STAT6 in BECs may be regulated by DNAm isito the best of

our knowledgeian entirely novel insight. All these results clearly
highlight the value of the FEM algorithm to identify novel bio-
logically and clinically interesting gene modules of coordinated
differential methylation and expression.

It is important to comment on the number and nature of the
inferred FEMs. In principle, a FEM could be driven by one gene
only, if this gene has exceptionally large absolute statistics of
differential methylation and expression. Other FEMs could be
driven by several genes, but with each one having only a mar-
ginally signiﬁcant statistic. Importantly, the FEM algorithm is
capable of identifying both types. For instance, in the application
to endometrial cancer we have observed FEMs of the two types,
with the HAND2 module being an example of the former, and
the TGFBIII module an example of the latter. In the case of the
HAND2 module, many genes showed differential methylation
changes, but only HAND2 showed the expected directional
change in gene expression, thus identifying it as the target of
the deregulated epigenetic hotspot. In the application to endo-
thelial cell differentiation, we observed a similar pattern, with
some FEMs driven mainly by individual genes with large differ-
ential methylation and expression statistics, and others driven by
a number of functionally related genes (e. g. the MHC module).
The existence of ‘rich’ modules (i.e. modules implicating several
targets, like the MHC module) should not be surprising because
functionally related genes are often commonly regulated, with
epigenetic mechanisms controlling this regulation. In particular,
application of FEM to complex tissues such as blood may reveal

many more rich modules, which are likely to be cell subtype-
speciﬁc. Indeed, it may be possible to use such rich modules as
a means of correcting for cellular heterogeneity.

However, in the application to endometrial cancer and endo-
thelial cell differentiation, we did not observe many rich FEMs.
This scarcity most likely reﬂects the noisy nature, or the level of
contextual irrelevance of the PPI network, yet it also likely re-
ﬂects our conservative approach to give the TSS200 region most
weight. An alternative approach, which selects the largest statis-
tic across the different genetic regions associated with a given
gene, would likely yield richer FEMs, yet the probability that
the observed deregulation is because of DNAm changes would
also be less clear. Our conservative approach, while identifying a
smaller number of rich FEMs, is more likely to identify those
which are under direct DNAm regulation. Another approach
would to rerun the algorithm giving more preference to the
ﬁrst exon and TSS1500 regions, but this resulted in similar mod-
ules (Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). An alternative explan-
ation for why rich FEMs are scarce could be biological. For
instance, most of the genes in the inferred FEMs are character-
ized by differential methylation or differential expression but not
both. The observed differential expression of module genes, not
caused by underlying in-cis DNAm changes, may nevertheless
still be caused by DNAm changes of neighbouring interacting
genes. As shown here, FEM identiﬁed many modules exhibiting
these types of alterations, and further investigation of these
patterns might be of interest.

We stress again that FEM represents a functional supervised
network algorithm, integrating multi-dimensional DNAm and
gene expression data in the context of a human PPI network.
The power of such functional supervised analyses has been pre-
viously demonstrated in the gene expression (Chuang et al.,
2007) and DNAm (West et al., 2013) contexts. Speciﬁcally,
these studies demonstrated that the use of a network, encoding
functional relations between genes, can improve the probability
of detecting a true positive. It is equally important, however,
to point out that any such integrative network approach is
restricted to a smaller search space because typically not all pro-
ﬁled genes may be present in the actual PPI network. Moreover,
in the application to Illumina Infinium 450k data, averaging over
probes within genetic regions, as done in the FEM algorithm,
can lead to loss of probe-level information. Thus, when analysing
matched DNAm and gene expression data, the FEM algorithm
should be Viewed as an analysis strategy, which complements the
more ordinary univariate supervised and Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis method.

In summary, the FEM algorithm presented here will be useful
to a growing number of studies that aim to identify gene modules
or molecular pathways that are epigenetically and functionally
deregulated in disease. Similarly, FEM could be applied to cel-
lular differentiation data to identify cell type-speciﬁc gene expres-
sion modules under the regulation of DNA methylation.

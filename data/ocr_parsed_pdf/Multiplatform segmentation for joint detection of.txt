ABSTRACT

Motivation: With the expansion of whole-genome studies, there
is rapid evolution of genotyping platforms. This leads to practical
issues such as upgrading of genotyping equipment which often
results in research groups having data from different platforms for
the same samples. While having more data can potentially yield
more accurate copy-number estimates, combining such data is
not straightforward as different platforms show different degrees of
attenuation of the true copy-number or different noise characteristics
and marker panels. Currently, there is still a relative lack of procedures
for combining information from different platforms.

Results: We develop a method, called MPSS, based on a correlated
random-effect model for the unobserved patterns and extend the
robust smooth segmentation approach to the multiple-platform
scenario. We also propose an objective criterion for discrete
segmentation required for downstream analyses. For each identified
segment, the software reports a P-value to indicate the likelihood
of the segment being a true CNV. From the analyses of real
and simulated data, we show that MPSS has better operating
characteristics when compared to single-platform methods, and
have substantially higher sensitivity compared to an existing
multiplatform method.

Availability: The methods are implemented in an R package MPSS,
and the source is available from http://www.meb.ki.se/~yudpaw.

1 INTRODUCTION

Copy-number variants (CNVs) are deﬁned as duplications or
deletions in the number of copies of a DNA segment (larger than
lkb in length) when compared to a reference genome. Currently,
common technologies used to detect CNVs include high-density

single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays and comparative-
genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays. In recent years, whole-genome
studies using commercial genotyping arrays to detect CNVs have
been rapidly expanding. With decreasing cost of commercially
available platforms and the fast evolution of these platforms, it is not
unusual for research groups to have data from multiple platforms
for each sample. For example, The Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, a joint effort of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to
explore genomic changes involved in human cancers, used Agilent
244K, Affymetrix SNP 6.0 and Illumina 550K platforms to measure
copy number alterations in its pilot study. Our own collaborators,
and perhaps many other researchers, collected genotype data using
both Illumina HumanHap300 and HumanHap24OS arrays for each
sample in order to get higher genome coverage.

Marker density is an important factor for comprehensive and
accurate detection of CNVs and their breakpoints, and different
platforms have different probe coverage and density; see Curtis
et al.(2009) for a summary of probe coverage of the different
platforms in the different chromosomes. Combining data from
different platforms can potentially yield more precise and accurate
detection of CNVs and its breakpoints. However, combining such
data is not straightforward because it is known that estimates from
different platforms show different degrees of attenuation of the true
copy-number changes (Bengtsson et al., 2009) as well as different
noise characteristics. Furthermore, different platforms have different
marker panels and molecular assay methods (Zhang et (11., 2010).
Currently, there is still a relative lack of formal procedures for
combining information from different platforms for copy-number
calling. Most studies with multiple platforms interrogating the same
samples process the data from the different platforms independently,
then combine the segments in an ad hoc manner. This approach
does not fully utilize information from the different platforms, and
when the segmented results from the different platforms differ, it
is difﬁcult for researchers to come to a consensus in a statistically
rigorous manner.

One published method, multiple platform circular binary
segmentation (MPCBS) (Zhang et al., 2010), is able to jointly
use information from different platforms for CNV calling. The
MPCBS method extends the circular binary segmentation (CBS)
algorithm (Olshen et (11., 2004) by detecting coupled changes
in multiple sequences. Brieﬂy, it uses a weighted sum of t-statistics

from a generalized log-likelihood ratio of a multiplatform model and
pools statistical evidence across platforms during segmentation.

The proposed multiplatform smooth segmentation (MPSS)
method extends Huang et al. (2007)’s smoothseg algorithm, which
is based on the Cauchy random-effect model that allows jumps
in the underlying copy-number patterns to the multiple platforms
scenario. The algorithm computes the estimated random-effect
estimates that capture the underlying copy-number patterns, and
is applicable to both germ-line and tumor DNA as long as the
data has been appropriately normalized. As we are often interested
in discrete segments of deletions, normal copies and duplications
for downstream analysis such as CNV association studies, we also
develop an objective method to obtain the discrete segmentation.
From analyses of real and simulated data, MPSS performs well
compared to single-platform methods, and shows substantially
higher sensitivity compared with MPCBS.

2 METHODS

We ﬁrst describe the correlated random-effect model for the unobserved
pattern. For each individual. denote XE {x1, ...,x,,} as the union of the
genomic locations of probes from the different platforms. with x1 <x2 <  <
x”. Denote  E {yxlf ,  yxnf} as the set of logz-intensity ratios from platform
j. nj is the number of probes in platform j. Let N =an. We consider the
model:

ya) :ﬁ(xij)+exif 
where  is the unknown platform-speciﬁc random-effects; the platform-
speciﬁc errors are independent and identically t-distributed with location
parameter 0. unknown dispersion parameter a]- and k degrees of freedom.
We assume the errors and the random-effects to be independent. The error
structure was chosen to be t-distributed to incorporate a heavy-tailed structure
that can deal with outliers in the observations. We simplify (l) to

yx, =f(x,y)+ ex, (2)

such that f(.) is a random effect parameter common to all platforms.
This simpliﬁcation is justiﬁed when data from the different platforms are
well normalized. because the different platforms are measuring the same
underlying copy-number pattern. If not. a normalization procedure has to
be applied ﬁrst. Note that the error term is still platform-speciﬁc. In matrix
form. we write (2) as

Y E Zf + 8

where Z is the model matrix determined by the observed x’s and the choice
of basis functions. We use the observed x’s as knots and choose the zero-
order B-splines. Hence. Z is the N by n model design matrix that indicates
the genomic locations of the probes from the different platforms. meaning
that the row of Z associated with the original data yij has value one at the
i-th location and zero otherwise. The smoothness of f can be expressed by

assuming that the scaled second-order differences a? E (2:22 are i.i.d. with
some distribution. Since f is mostly smooth. the size of a,» E Azf,» = (Axi)2a;‘
is very small relative to the local noise. So. there will be little difference
whether we specify the model on a? or 61,». For convenience. we shall use the
latter. We choose the Cauchy distribution with location 0 and scale factor 0%.
The Cauchy distribution has been used to deal with jumps in the underlying
patterns. with desirable results (see Huang et al.. 2007. 2009).

 

2.1 Estimation off Via maximum likelihood

We derive an iterative weighted least squares algorithm by maximizing
the likelihood of the Cauchy random-effects model (see Huang et al..
2007 and Pawitan. 2001. pp. 464—466). The log-likelihood based on y and

Differentiating (3) with respect to f . we get:

where W is a N by N diagonal matrix with diagonal elements wij =

 assoc1ated w1th the correspondmg or1g1nal data yij. In scalar
form. the i-th element of (5) can be written as zit/12,701,]- —ﬁ). Differentiating

1(a): —D—‘a (6)
where a = Azf . denoted by A2 the (rt—2) by n matrix that represents the
second-order difference operator and

D‘1 =diag [2/(a%+a?>]
Combining (5) and (6). we obtain the score function. the ﬁrst derivative of
logL(f,a]%,UJ-2) as:
S(f)=(Z’WY—Z’WZf)—(A2)’D"(A2)f
Setting SQ”)=O. we get
[Z’WZ+(A2)’D“(A2)]f=Z’WY (7)
We estimate f from (7) by exploiting the band-limited property of [Z’ WZ +

(A2)’D_1(A2)] and use well-tested fortran subroutines available in Linpack
(see Huang et al.. 2007 and Dongarra et al.. 1979).

2.2 Estimation of orj
Given f. at each probe position i. the deviance is deﬁned as
.. _ A. 2
di=(k+1)log:1+ 
This can be approximated by the gamma distribution with mean Mi and
dispersion ¢. To estimate 11,». we use a generalized linear model with a log-
link function. so h(p.)=log(p.) and h(p.,»)=x§ot. where the dimension of x,
and at is equal to the number of platforms. We solve using IWLS with robust
weights:

(1) Start with an initial 010. We estimate ¢ once using a):

estimate. we use the average of the cijs.

2.3 Choosing optimal A
The degrees of freedom associated with f is given by (Pawitan. 2001. p. 448)
df =trace{(z’Wz+(A2)’D—‘(A2))—‘Z’WZ}

where W and D are computed using This expression is hard to obtain
computationally. so we use an approximation (Pawitan. 1996)

rt—2 M7
df % f
g w+ vi /a’

where 171/ and [—z' are the average diagonals of Z ’ WZ and D. and

vk =2[l —cos{rr(k— l)/n}]

is the j-th eigenvalue of the second derivative matrix A2. We choose A that
minimizes the Akaike information criterion (AIC)

AIC(A) = —2 210.90,;fo 2df

2.4 Summary of MPSS algorithm

For a given A = “:3; ) . we employ the following algorithm:
f

 

(a) Start with an initial value for f0 and (52’s.

(b) Compute a]? = 
(c) Compute Z’WZ and D‘1 and update f using (7).
(d) Update (712’s as described in Section 2.2 .

(e) Repeat (b)7(d) until convergence.

2.5 P-values for segments
The Fisher information for f is the negative of the second derivative of the
log-likelihood.

At convergence. the estimated variance matrix is
V =I“(f)

If we have a segment 8. deﬁned for instance by setting a threshold. then
f5 is a vector which contains the estimated values in the segment and zero
everywhere else.

f, ifi is in s

0 otherwise

f8,i = {
The signiﬁcance of the segment can be assessed using the statistic
x2 =12; v—‘fs (12)

To compute (12) without explicitly obtaining the inverse of a matrix with
extremely large dimension. we write (12) as

fétl’WZ+(A2)’D“(A2)]fs =Zv§,,w,)+2(a§,di).

where asg,» contains the second-order differences of f5 and [1' contains the
diagonal elements of D”. We compare this statistic to the chi-squared
distribution with (1 degrees of freedom. where q is the number of probes
in 8. To adjust for multiple hypothesis testing involving a large number of
segments. we compute the false discovery rate (FDR) for each segment.

2.6 Objective threshold segmentation

A segment whose random-effects parameter f consistently and signiﬁcantly
deviates from zero is evident of a deletion/duplication. We obtain potential
copy-number segments by setting thresholds for f. where duplications are
sets of consecutive probes for which )2 is consistently greater than or equal to
a speciﬁed threshold. and deletions are sets of consecutive probes for which
)2 is consistently smaller than or equal to a speciﬁed threshold. For automatic
threshold selection. users can pick the threshold that maximizes the total X2
values (scaled by its associated degrees of freedom).

To avoid oversegmentation. we merge the segments if the distance
between adjacent segments is less than 5 kb. For each segment. we compute
its associated P-value/FDR as described in the previous section. We further
ﬁlter the segments by its length (those that are less than 1 kb are omitted).
FDR and number of probes (minimum number of probes within segment
is 10). A segment will also be omitted if the adjacent distance between 2
consecutive probes is larger than 100 times the median interprobe distance.
All ﬁltering parameters can be changed by the user. Users can also ﬁlter the
segments by probe density (Number of probes/length of segment).

2.7 Removal of discrepant segments

For each segment identiﬁed by the MPSS algorithm. we test if the mean
intensity from the different platforms differ using a t-test (corrected for
autocorrelation. assuming the data has a ﬁrst-order autoregressive structure)
if there are two platforms and ANOVA if there is more than two platforms.
We remove the segments where the FDR for the test is <0.01. We call these
segments ‘discrepant segments”. Discrepant segments are removed because
the multiplatform algorithm assumes the signals from the different platforms
are consistent with each other. hence signals from ‘discrepant’ segments are
likely to be unreliable.

2.8 Comparisons using simulated data

We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of MPSS as well
as to compare against the MPCBS method. To get a realistic noise pattern.
we use the empirical CNV proﬁle of chromosome 1 of the Hapmap sample
NA10851. We use data from both Affymetrix 6.0 and Illumina 1M platforms
(see Section 3.1) and apply the MPSS algorithm with segmentation threshold
of 0.05 and FDR threshold of 10—5. We remove segments with <4 probes as
extremely short segments are more likely to be false positives due to noise.
We label the different segments of the chromosome as CNV or ‘NULL’. In
total. there are 12 CNV segments and 13 ‘NULL’ segments. We perform
the simulation study at three different noise levels; the input values are the
smoothed intensities plus 0.5. l. and 2 times the residuals from the respective
platforms. Note that the smoothed intensities plus 1 times the residuals is
exactly the original input intensities. We sample the 25 segments randomly
with replacement and use their corresponding intensity values as input to the
MPSS and MPCBS algorithms. We calculate the percentage of CNV probes
that were correctly identiﬁed (sensitivity) and the percentage of ‘NULL’
probes that were correctly identiﬁed (speciﬁcity). We repeat the process 100
times by bootstrapping from the residuals.

Labeling the CNV segments using segments originally identiﬁed by the
MPSS method may bias the analysis in favor of MPSS. Hence. we also repeat
the whole process. labeling the CNV segments using segments identiﬁed by
MPCBS. with a segmentation threshold of 0.05. After removing those with
less than 4 probes. we are left with 6 CNV segments and 7 ‘NULL’ segments.

2.9 Comparisons using real data

We compare MPSS against the single-platform smoothseg as well as MPCBS
in a real data setting. We use the integer copy-numbers for a total of 5037
CNV loci from Conrad 21 al.(2010)’s study as well as McCarrol et al.(2008)’s
study as a reference list. A set of 20 NimbleGen arrays. each comprising
2.1-million long oligonucleotide probes were used to ﬁrst generate a new
map of CNV locations. Subsequently. a customized Agilent CGH-platform

comprising of 105 000 long oligonucleotide probes was used to detect the
loci and the genotypes were estimated for 450 HapMap samples using a
Bayesian algorithm with stringent selection for optimal normalization and
cluster locations for every locus [See Supplementary Material in Conrad
21 al. (2010) for more details]. We remove segments in the reference if the
number of probes from the combined probe list from the two platforms we
are using is less than 10 or if the segment size is less than 1 kb. There is a
median of 163 CNV segments per individual.

It should be noted. however. that this reference list cannot really be
considered the gold standard. as even sequencing data do not have 100%
sensitivity and speciﬁcity in CNV detection (Xie et al.. 2009). For each
method. we perform individual-speciﬁc comparisons with Conrad’s CNVs
and compute the number of bases that are called as CNV both by the
method and by Conrad 21 al. We report the number of overlapping bases
as a proportion to the total length of CNVs identiﬁed by the method and
as a proportion of total length of Conrad’s CNVs. While these may not be
considered a ‘true discovery rate” and ‘sensitivity’. since Conrad’s CNVs
are well-validated. a higher proportion of overlap is an indication of better
performance.

2.10 Implementation and computing time

The methods are implemented in an R package MPSS. The main
inputs are vectors of genomic positions. chromosome numbers and
logz-intensity ratios from each platform. It is recommended that users
check if data from the different platforms are well-normalized. If not.
background correction should be performed ﬁrst; the package rsmooth
from http://www.meb.ki.se/~yudpaw can be used for background correction.
All computations for this article was done on a 3 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
processor. For 1 individual. with more than 2.5 million combined probes from
Affymetrix 6.0 and Illumina 1M. and for a user-speciﬁed A. the algorithm
takes <1 min. It takes <6 min if the AIC criteria is used to ﬁnd the optimal A.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Datasets and background correction

We use nine HapMap samples (International HapMap Consortium,
2005 and see Supplementary Materials for sample ID and
population). These samples were previously genotyped by two SNP
arrays (Illumina 1M and Affymetrix 6.0) in our research lab. We
ﬁrst perform background correction on the logZ-intensity ratios from
each platform using a robust smoother in the rsmooth package from
http://www.meb.ki.se/~yudpaw. This normalization assumes that
the majority of the genome does not contain CNVs, which is the
case for germline samples.

To investigate if the input intensities are well-normalized, we
randomly sample a non-CNV segment of 100 consecutive probes
and test if the mean intensity for the Affymetrix platform is equal to
the mean intensity of the Illumina platform (using t-test corrected for
autocorrelation). We repeat the process 1000 times and record the
percentage of P-values that are less than 0.01. The normalization
results look reasonable for all individuals with the percentage of
P-values less than 0.01 ranging from 0.0043 to 0.02.

3.2 Estimated parameters

For each chromosome, we use the A that minimizes the AIC criterion.
A large variation in the optimal A is observed across the genome,
indicating the need for the selection of different As for different
chromosomes. For example, for individual NA19139, the optimal
A ranges from about 47 for Chromosome 15 to about 4900 for
Chromosome 19; see Figure 1.

3.3 Choice of thresholds

For each individual, we choose the deletion and duplication
thresholds that give the largest total scaled chi-squared value. For
individual NA19139, the deletion and duplication thresholds was
chosen to be 0.13 (Fig. 2). At the chosen threshold values, after
removing the discrepant segments (see Section 2.7), the algorithm
identiﬁes a median of 137, 129, 117 and 110 segments that passed
the FDR threshold of 10T6, 10_7, 10_8 and 10T9, respectively.
The median length of the segments are 15.6, 16.1, 16.7 and 17.3
respectively.

At the same segmentation and FDR thresholds, the single platform
algorithm identiﬁes a median of 68, 63, 58 and 56 segments (median
length of 39.6, 41.4, 43.3 and 42.8 kb) for the Illumina platform and
81, 77, 69 and 66 segments (median length of 40.8, 41.6, 44.5 and
45.1kb) for the Affymetrix platform.

We apply the MPCBS method on the signals, post-background
correction, and use the modiﬁed Bayesian information criterion
(BIC) approach as suggested by the authors to estimate the number of
segments. The maximum number of change points per chromosome
is set to 30. MPCBS outputs the breakpoints of the segments as
well as the estimated response from each platform. We calculate
the estimated response for each segment as the average of the
responses from the two platforms. For each individual, we vary the
segmentation thresholds such that the total length of CNVs identiﬁed
by MPCBS is similar to MPSS. Similar results are obtained if we
control the number of CNVs, so the results are not shown here. We
require that the segments have a minimum of 10 SNPs, a minimum

length of 1 kb and a maximum length of 1.1 Mb. The median length
of the segments at these thresholds are 21.8, 21.8, 21.7 and 21.7 kb,
respectively.

We also ran the single platform CBS algorithm. With or = 0.01 and
segmentation threshold of :I: 0.01, 0.02, 0.03 and 0.04, we obtain a
median of 30, 28, 26 and 26 segments (median length of 21.9, 19,
16.1 and 14.8 kb) for the Illumina platform and a median of 75, 73,
71 and 69 segments (median length of 37.8, 34.8, 34.3 and 31.5 kb)
for the Affymetrix platform.

3.4 Comparison: simulated data

The average sensitivity and speciﬁcity across 100 bootstrap samples
are summarized in Table 1. For most scenarios, both MPSS and
MPCBS have high speciﬁcity (greater than 99%), though MPSS
has slightly lower speciﬁcity when noise level is decreased. For both
algorithms, sensitivity increases with decreased noise level and vice
versa. In all cases, MPSS has substantially higher sensitivity than
MPCBS. Mean sensitivity for MPSS can be as high as 80% when
the noise level is decreased, whereas MPCBS only attains a mean
sensitivity of about 41%. When noise level is high, both algorithms
perform poorly—MPSS with a mean sensitivity of about 18% and
MPCBS with a mean sensitivity of about 10%. However, note that
with twice the magnitude of the residuals, the platform variability is
increased to four times the original variability. With such high level
of noise, unless the CNV signal is very strong, no algorithm is likely
to identify the CNV.

3.5 Comparison: real data

When signals from the different platforms are consistent, we
get increased power to detect the CNVs when we combine the
information from the different platforms, especially in areas where
a single platform has low density of probes. Figure 3a shows that
the Illumina platform has a single probe in the deletion region,
and while this probe exhibits strong evidence of a decreased
intensity (log2-intensity ratio less than —3), the single platform
approach was unable to identify the deletion. On the other hand,
the Affymetrix platform has several probes in the region with
moderately decreased logZ-intensity ratio values, and the single
platform approach detects a slight dip but the evidence is not strong.
With the multiplatform approach, we see strong evidence of a
deletion in that area. The gray shaded area indicates the CNV region
identiﬁed by the HapMap 3 project release 3 (downloaded from

Fig. 3. Examples of segments detected by the multiplatform methods.
(a) A deletion in Chromosome 8 of individual NA19139. Single platform
smoothseg on Illumina platform was unable to identify the deletion due
to lack of probes in the region. Single platform smoothseg on Affymetrix
platform was unable to identify the deletion due to insufﬁcient signal. (b)
A deletion in Chromosome 16 of individual NA19139. Single platform
smoothseg on Affymetrix platform was unable to identify the deletion due
to complete lack of probes in the region. (c) A deletion in Chromosome 22

on 20 July 2010); this particular individual NA19139 was found
to have a homozygous deletion in this region. In some cases, a
single platform is unable to detect the CNV due to complete lack
of probes in that region (Fig. 3b).

When signals from different platforms are inconsistent, it is
difﬁcult for the multiplatform method to detect the CNV. Even if the
CNV segments are identiﬁed, they are likely to be false positives.
For example, at the FDR threshold of 1e-6, the true discovery rate
for the non-discrepant segments is 15.5% but it is 5.1% for the
discrepant segments. On average, we remove 22 discrepant segments
per individual.

Figure 4 plots the proportion of bases that overlap with Conrad’s
CNVs as a function of total length of CNVs for MPSS and MPCBS.
MPSS has a higher proportion of base overlap with Conrad’s CNVs
as compared to MPCBS. Figure 5, which plots the amount of
overlapping bases as a proportion of Conrad’s CNVs versus the
amount of overlapping bases as a proportion of each method’s
CNVs, also shows the better performance of MPSS as compared
to all the other methods.

3.6 Application: breast cancer data

To demonstrate the applicability of the method for large studies, we
apply the method to samples from the Cancer Hormone Replacement
Epidemiology in Sweden (CAHRES) study, a population-based
study which includes women aged 50—74 years, born in Sweden and
resident there between October 1, 1993 and March 31, 1995 (Li et al.,
2008). A subset of 804 subjects were selected for genotyping on the
HumanHap300 and HumanHap240S arrays. Clinical information

made available to us includes lymph node status, tumor size and
histologic grade. Prior to combining data from the two platforms, we
use rsmooth package(http://www.meb.ki.se/~yudpaw) to perform
background correction with the smoothing parameter set to A = 105.

The background-corrected intensity data is then used as inputs
to MPSS algorithm. We choose the optimal smoothing parameter,
A based on the AIC criterion. For convenience, the segmentation
threshold is ﬁxed at the 5th and 95th percentile of the intensities
for deletions and duplications, respectively. These are similar to
objectively chosen values in the previous examples. We ﬁirther ﬁlter
out segments with FDR more than 0.01, number of probes less than
10, length of segments less than 1 kb and segments with discrepant
signals from the two platforms.

An average of 14 deletions and 4.5 duplications are identiﬁed per
individual. The median length of deletions is 113 kb and that for

duplications is 140 kb. We use the method in Teo et al. (2010) to
form common CNV segments, deﬁned as segments with consecutive
probes where there is at least 0.5% of the subjects (~4 subjects)
whose individual segments overlap with the probes. We identiﬁed
942 common segments (median length of 114.5 kb).

We test each segment for association with tumor size (n=540
with size <2 cm versus 11:60 with size >3 cm), lymph node
status (n=242 lymph-node positive versus n=561 negative) and
tumor grade (11 = 118 grade-1, n = 377 grade-2 and n = 308 grade-3).
Fisher’s exact test is used to compute the P-values. There are no
signiﬁcant associations with tumor size. For lymph-node status,
6 segments have P <0.01 (see Supplementary Table T2). Of
notable interest is segment 159 in Chromosome 3 which overlaps
with the protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, G (PTPRG)
gene; overexpression of PTPRG was found to inhibit anchorage-
independent growth and proliferation of breast cancer cells (Shu
et al., 2010). Another interesting segment is segment 845 in
Chromosome 17, which overlaps with the ITGB4 gene, where
studies have shown its expression to be correlated with tumor size
and nuclear grade (Diaz et al., 2005) and signiﬁcantly association
with basal-like breast cancer (Lu et al., 2008).

Ten segments are associated with tumor grade (see Supplementary
Table T3). Segment 548 in Chromosome 9 overlaps with TPM2
gene, where its protein products were found to be differentially
expressed between tumor and non-tumor forming breast cancer cell
lines (Harris et al., 2002). Segment 691 in Chromosome 11 overlaps
with the PKNOX2 gene, previously shown to be deleted in breast
cancer (Issei et al., 2001).

The 240K array was designed to supplement the 300K array, hence
the probes on the two arrays are non-overlapping. The validation of
the method in the earlier sections was performed on Affymetrix 6.0
and Illumina 1M arrays which have overlapping probes. Here, we
are interested to know if the algorithm works for non-overlapping
platforms. However, we do not have a ‘gold standard’ for CNVs
of these individuals to make comparisons with. Instead, we take
a random sample of non-overlapping 240 000 and 300 000 probes
from the Illumina 1M platform for the 9 HapMap samples and make
comparisons with the reference CNVs in the same way as before. The
true discovery rate and sensitivity for the multiplatform approach is
higher than that of the single platform approach: true discovery rate
of 0.29 for the multiplatform approach, 0.24 for the 300K array and
0.22 for the 240K array. Sensitivity of 0.027 for the multiplatform
approach, 0.027 for the 300K array and 0.017 for the 240K array.

4 DISCUSSION

We have described a new method for identifying CNVs by using
data from multiple platforms simultaneously. This method allows
researchers to come to a formal consensus result when data from
different platforms but for the same individuals are available.
The model assumes a random-effects parameter that is common
to all platforms, meaning that each platform is assumed to have
the same underlying copy-number pattern. We also develop an
objective method to segment the estimated random effects parameter
(which describes the underlying copy-number pattern) into discrete
segments. In addition, we provide a method for calculating a P-value
associated with a segment of interest. The P-value would indicate
how likely that the segment is a deletion/duplication, and is useful
for ﬁltering out likely false positives.

Multi-platform segmentation

 

Background correction is needed to make the data from the
different platforms comparable; we use a robust smoother that
assumes the majority of each chromosome has normal copy-number.
While this assumption is likely to be true for germ-line samples,
it may not hold for cancer/tumor samples. Recently, Bengtsson
et (11. (2009) developed a normalization method to bring data from
different platforms to the same scale. The method uses a technique
based on principal curves to estimate the normalization functions.
This method was tested on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network and seems to work well on tumor samples where
there is sufﬁcient deletions and duplications in the genome, but
we found that it did not work well with the germ-line samples we
use. When we performed Bengtsson et (11.(2009)’s normalization on
our samples, the correlation in the copy-number estimates between
the platforms increased only very slightly after normalization (see
Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table T3). This could be due to
insufﬁcient CNVs in the data for the principal curves to be identiﬁed.

We illustrate the performance of MPSS using real and simulated
data sets. In the comparisons using real datasets, we show that MPSS
CNVs has greater amount of overlap with the reference as compared
to the other methods. In the comparisons using simulated datasets,
we show that the proposed method can achieve high sensitivity and
speciﬁcity at reasonable noise levels.

In general, for all methods, the proportion of overlapping bases
with the highly comprehensive CNV map published by Conrad
et (11. (2010) is low. However, we believe it is due to the limitation
of the SNP arrays rather than the inadequacy of the algorithms.
This was also noted by Zhang et (11. (2010) where the authors
investigated and found that in the regions where the reference CNVs
lie, both Affymetrix and Illumina platforms do not have a shift
in the intensities and hence the algorithm would not pick out the
region as a CNV. Moreover, we do not know if the reference list
we have used can be considered the gold standard, since it is not
likely to have 100% sensitivity and speciﬁcity. Even sequencing
methods only show between 72.2% and 96.5% speciﬁcity (Xie et (11.,
2009). The arrival of higher density arrays, for example, the Illumina
HumanOmni2.5 and HumanOmni5 arrays will likely improve the
sensitivity of CNV identiﬁcation.

Another kind of multiplatform problem arises when there is some
stratiﬁcation of cohorts by chips; for example, if the cases and
controls were typed on different chips. Differential sensitivity or
false positive rates between the platforms will lead to confounding
bias in the case—control comparisons. The method presented here
assumes that the data from the different platforms are available
for each individual, hence the algorithm could not address this
problem. This is an important and valid concern and warrants ﬁirther
investigations.

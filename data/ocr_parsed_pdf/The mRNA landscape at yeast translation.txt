ABSTRACT

Summary: Although translation initiation has been well studied,
many questions remain in elucidating its mechanisms. An ongoing
challenge is to understand how ribosomes choose a translation
initiation site (T IS). To gain new insights, we analyzed large sets
of TlSs with the aim of identifying common characteristics that are
potentially of functional importance. Nucleotide sequence context
has previously been demonstrated to play an important role in the
ribosome’s selection of a TIS, and mRNA secondary structure is also
emerging as a contributing factor.

Here, we analyze mRNA secondary structure using the folding
predictions of the RNAfold algorithm. We present a method for
analyzing these results using a rank-ordering approach to assess
the overall degree of predicted secondary structure in a given region
of mRNA. In addition, we used a modified version of the algorithm
that makes use of only a subset of the standard version’s output
to incorporate base-pairing polarity constraints suggested by the
ribosome scanning process. These methods were employed to study
the TlSs of 1735 genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Trends in base composition and base-pairing probabilities suggest
that efficient translation initiation and high protein expression are
aided by reduced secondary structure upstream and downstream
of the TIS. However, the downstream reduction is not observed
for sets of TlSs with nucleotide sequence contexts unfavorable
for translation initiation, consistent with previous suggestions that
secondary structure downstream of the ribosome can facilitate TIS
recognition.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the scanning model of translation initiation (Kozak, 1989),
a small ribosomal subunit binds at the m7G cap of an mRNA
transcript and scans in the 3’ direction until it reaches the ﬁrst AUG
codon in an appropriate sequence context. The small subunit then
assembles with the large ribosomal subunit and initiates translation
of the open reading frame, terminating upon reaching the ﬁrst
in-frame stop codon. However, some instances of non-standard
translational events such as leaky scanning (leaky initiation),
alternative translation initiation and initiation at non-canonical

(i.e. non-AUG) start codons fall outside the original model (Kozak,
2002; Touriol et (11., 2003; Wang and Rothnagel, 2004).

The recognition/initiation event depends partially on the
nucleotide sequence context ﬂanking the initiation codon. It has
been noted previously that positions —3 and +4 relative to
the initiation codon provide particularly strong cues (Kozak,
1986b). Information-based measures of context based on sequence
conservation surrounding aligned TISs suggest that other nucleotide
positions also contribute to recognition. The translation relative
individual information (TRII) score (Supplementary Material 1.1;
M.Weir and M.Rice, submitted for publication) is a convenient
and sensitive measure of sequence conservation in sets of aligned
sequences. The TRII score of each sequence is the same as
its individual information (Schneider, 1997) but incorporates
background nucleotide frequencies. By taking into account the
relative frequencies of all four nucleotides at each position in an
alignment of high-conﬁdence functional start sites, TRII scores
quantify an individual sequence’s conformance to characteristic
nucleotide preferences in the vicinity of the TIS.

It has been shown that mRNA secondary structure can inﬂuence
scanning and translating ribosomes. In various viruses, Escherichia
coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, pseudoknot secondary structures
have been associated with frameshifting of translating ribosomes
(Jacobs et al., 2007; Tzeng et al., 1992) and stop codon readthrough
(Wills et (11., 1994). Secondary structure, including pseudoknots,
can also inﬂuence the selection of a translation initiation site (TIS).
Examples include functioning of viral internal ribosome entry sites
(IRES) (Balvay et al., 2009) and modulation through riboswitches
characterized in prokaryotes; it is speculated that future studies may
uncover analogous riboswitch regulation in eukaryotes (Wachter,
2010).

Moreover, a hairpin positioned downstream of a TIS can increase
the probability of initiation when the initiation codon is in an
otherwise unfavorable nucleotide sequence context. It has been
proposed that the effect of this hairpin is to slow the scanning
ribosomal subunit, increasing the interaction between the initiation
codon and the ribosomal machinery (Kochetov et al., 2007; Kozak,
1990). Conversely, a sufﬁciently stable hairpin upstream of a TIS
can completely abolish initiation at that site, perhaps by interfering
with the small ribosomal subunit before it reaches the TIS (Kozak,
1986a).

To evaluate ﬁlrther these roles of RNA secondary structure in
TIS recognition, we applied the RNA folding algorithm RNAfold
(McCaskill, 1990) to subsets of mRNAs selected based on TRII
scores, proteome-scale protein expression studies (Ghaemmaghami
et al., 2003) and ribosome-proﬁling studies (Ingolia et al., 2009).

were compared with those of TISs with low TRII scores (TRII 10W).
Similarly, we compared RNA structures for TISs with higher
and lower ribosome density (Ribosomehigt1 and Ribosomelow,
respectively) and genes with higher and lower protein expression.
The trends revealed by these comparisons suggest how RNA
secondary structure can inﬂuence both positively and negatively the
ﬁinctioning of the translation machinery.

2 METHODS

2.1 RNA folding simulations

RNAfold (Hofacker et al.. 1994) was used to conduct folding simulations
on various subsets of a set of 1735 S.cerevisiae genes. This HiConf
set comprised annotated TISs in which we had high conﬁdence (see
Supplementary Material 1.1). The RNAfold program is based on an
equilibrium partition function (McCaskill. 1990). Rather than output only
the minimum free energy structure of an input sequence. RNAfold considers
the ensemble of all possible structures and weights each by its energetic
favorability (Zuker and Stiegler. 1981). Based on the set of possible structures
and their associated weights. RNAfold computes for each nucleotide in the
input sequence the probability of base pairing with each other nucleotide in
the sequence.

The total base-pairing probability (TotalBPP) of a position in a nucleotide
sequence is calculated by summing the individual probabilities of every
possible pair involving that position. This metric was used to quantify
a given mRNA region’s overall potential to form secondary structure.
The downstream base-pairing probability (DownBPP) of a nucleotide
position is calculated by summing the individual probabilities of every
possible base pair involving that position and any downstream position.
The DownBPP metric may better reﬂect the probability that a nucleotide
position is involved in a structure when a scanning ribosome encounters it.
given that upstream nucleotides protected by the ~30 nt ribosome footprint
(Ingolia et al.. 2009; Steitz. 1969) may be less likely to be involved in mRNA
secondary structure.

Two approaches were used to interpret the RNAfold output. We examined
base-pairing probabilities at the resolution of individual positions with the
ﬁrst approach. and we measured regional trends in base-pairing probability in
the second approach to provide greater sensitivity when comparing sequence
sets. The two approaches are described below.

2.1.] Position-speciﬁc analysis To investigate position-speciﬁc trends
in predicted structure. sets of genes were aligned at their T155 and
mean TotalBPP and mean DownBPP were calculated at each position.
The position-speciﬁc approach was used to analyze aligned open reading
frame (ORF) sequences. As a control. and to provide a benchmark for
comparison. randomly generated sequences were subjected to the same
analysis. For analysis of ORF sequences. we used randomly generated
sequences with a frequency of 0.25 for each nucleotide (Randomogs).

2.1.2 Rank-ordered analysis The above position-speciﬁc approach has
the disadvantage that unless positional base pairing is well aligned with
the alignment landmark (TIS). high-probability base-pairing predictions in
individual sequences will tend to be diluted in the computation of the mean.
To address this problem. we used an alternative approach (Fig. Sl) that
focused on the number and probability of base-pairing events (but not their
speciﬁc locations) in a selected region of the sequence alignment.

Sets of genes aligned at their TISs were analyzed for the overall
degree of predicted secondary structure in a region chosen relative to
the TIS. Positional TotalBPP values of each sequence in the alignment
were sorted high-to-low (i.e. ranked) and equivalently ranked values
were averaged (Fig. $1). This approach was used to analyze predicted
secondary structure of 5’UTR sequences. Two sets of randomly generated
sequences provided a baseline for comparison: Randomogs (see above)

and RandomUTR (which reﬂected nucleotide frequencies found in observed
5’UTRs (Miura et al.. 2006; Nagalakshmi et al.. 2008) excluding the region
from —40 to —1; see Section 3).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Upstream of AUG

3.1.1 Neighborhood assessment using TRII scores The
eukaryotic consensus sequence surrounding a TIS—C C (A|G) C
C AUG G—is typically considered to comprise a relatively narrow
window of positions (Kozak, 1987). Similarly, the TIS in budding
yeast has a narrow consensus sequence

Consensus0.5,_0.5 = N A\U A\(C|U) N\G A\U AUG G C\(A|U))

deﬁned by the frequency weight matrix for HiConf TISs (Fig. 1),
where A\(G|U) denotes ‘A and not G and not U’ (M.Weir and
M.Rice, submitted for publication). The consensus is dominated
by excluded nucleotides which have negative weight matrix values
(Fig. 1). Computation of TRII scores over the interval —5 to +5
reveals that the score distribution for 1735 HiConf start sites can be
distinguished from the distribution for 2000 RandomUTR artiﬁcial
sites (Fig. 2A). Although the distinction is more subtle, HiConf sites
can also be distinguished from RandomUTR sites by comparing the
distributions of TRII scores computed over the interval —20 to —6
(Fig. 2A). This suggests that there are characteristics upstream of
functional start sites that may contribute to recognition and initiation.

3.1.2 Nucleotide frequency proﬁles To investigate the upstream
region and the nature of its apparent contribution to TIS recognition,
positional nucleotide frequencies were calculated for an alignment
of the 713 HiConf genes (Fig. 2B) having 5’UTR 3 100. A strong
trend was noted for the HiConf subset beginning at approximately
position —40. The frequency of A increases to about 42% while the
frequency of U decreases to about 26%. In contrast, the frequencies
of G and C remain fairly uniform over this region, although G is a
little depressed compared to C. While the AU and GC content are
fairly uniform, there is selection for A over U and for C over G in
the coding strand of double-stranded DNA upstream of the TIS.

Fig. 2. (A) TRII score distributions for aligned high-conﬁdence TISs can be distinguished from AUG triplets ﬂanked by random sequences using either the
canonical region —5 to +5 (C-f- HiCOVlf—s..5 With RandomUTR—SHS) or the interval —20 to —6 upstream of the TIS (c.f. HiConf_20“_5 with RandomUTR_20“_5)
(x2 goodness-of—ﬁt tests P < 0.01). (B) The set of 713 aligned Hi Conf start sites with observed 5’UTR lengthz 100 exhibits a striking divergence of A and U
frequencies over the interval —40 to — 1. (C1 and C2) The HiConf set was partitioned by TRII score into subsets TRIIhigh and TRII]0W (C1; see Supplementary
Material 1.1). and by ribosome density into subsets Ribosomehigh and Ribosomei0w (C2). Each set was analyzed for secondary structure upstream of the TIS
using the rank-ordering approach (see Fig. $1). The TRIIhigh and Ribosomehigh subsets (unﬁlled circles) exhibited a signiﬁcant reduction of predicted secondary
structure while the TRII]0W and Ribosomei0w subsets (gray triangles) exhibited a slight reduction compared with sets of random sequences Randomogs (gray
diamonds) and RandomUTR (gray squares). (D) A nucleotide secondary structure (NSS) index of a position in an alignment was calculated by subtracting
the frequency of A at that position from the sum of the frequencies of U and G. A higher NSS index indicates a greater propensity for secondary structure
formation; shown is the NSS index proﬁle of TRIIhigh genes. A strong depression is evident over —40..+1. and a more subtle depression is evident in the
critical region + 10 to +20. (E) To examine secondary structure downstream of the TIS. mean DownBPP values were computed for each position in alignments
of TRIIhigh (black) and TRII]0W (gray). which in this case comprised the top 10% and bottom 5+15% of TRII scorers. respectively. Both subsets exhibit a
depression in the critical region +10 to +20 compared to Randomogs (light gray). and TRIIhigh exhibits a more pronounced depression than TRIIIOW. Similar
effects were observed monitoring TotalBPP instead of DownBPP (Fig. S9B.C) although TotalBPP does not accommodate protection of upstream positions
by the ribosome footprint. Error bars show 1.96 SD (95% thresholds) for 100 sets of 87 (C1. C2) or 174 (E) random sequences. (F) Hypothetical model of
the RNA landscape surrounding a TIS.

The base-pairing potential of U is higher than A. While A can base
pair only with U, the U nucleotide can base pair with either A or G,
the latter through non-canonical G:U pairing. Hence, we speculated
that the observed elevated A and depressed U and G indicated that
there is selection for reduced RNA structure in the region upstream
of the TIS. To investigate this possibility, we examined predicted
RNA structure upstream of the TIS.

RNAfold algorithm to predict RNA secondary structures. Because
the nucleotide frequency proﬁles (Fig. 2B) did not suggest that
the precise positions of base pairing were likely to be important,
we decided to use a rank-ordering ﬁlter to assess the predictions.
This approach (Fig. S1) indicates the number of high-probability
base-pairings over a region. After running RNAfold on mRNA
sequences from —60 to +60, we applied the rank-ordering ﬁlter to
the set of output probabilities (TotalBPP; see Section 2) for positions
—40 to — 1.

For analysis, we chose to compare TRIIhigi1 with TRIIlOW (see
Supplementary Material 1.1; Fig. S2). As controls, RNAfold was run

3.1.3 Predicted RNA secondary structure Given that the region
—40 to —1 has been implicated in TIS recognition, we used the

on RandomUTR and Random025 sequences. Compared to both sets
of controls, the TRIIhigi1 set showed highly depressed predicted base
pairing, whereas the TRII 10W subset has less pronounced depression
(Figs. 2C1, S3A). An analogous assessment of positions —8 to —1
(Kochetov et al., 2003) similarly showed a negative correlation
between TIS quality and TotalBPP. This result is consistent with
the idea that the TRII score, which was applied to a window of —40
to +40 relative to the AUG, incorporates sequence preferences that
tend to reduce RNA secondary structure. Indeed, the weight matrix
used to compute TRII scores generally has small positive entries for
A and small negative entries for U upstream of —6 (similar to Fig. 1,
shaded weight matrix entries), consistent with this interpretation.
These trends are also illustrated by the proﬁle of a nucleotide
secondary structure index, NSS = (freq U + freq G — freq A), which
has a pronounced depression between —40 and 1 (TRIIhigh, Fig. 2D;
compare with TRII 10W, Fig. S6C), providing a striking delineation
of the TIS.

Since TRII scores indicate how well sequences conform to TIS
consensus sequences, we wished to test whether genes with high
protein expression similarly show depressed predicted secondary
structure upstream of the TIS. Recent ribosome proﬁling analysis
using deep sequencing (Ingolia et al., 2009) has suggested that
ribosome tag densities are an excellent indicator of protein
expression. Therefore, we selected from the HiConf set a subset
of 165 genes with high ribosome tag densities (Ribosomehigh, see
Supplementary Material 1.1). Compared to both sets of controls
(RandomUTR and Randomogs), the Ribosomehigi1 set showed highly
depressed predicted base pairing (Figs. 2C2, S3B) and NSS index
(Fig. S6A), suggesting that depression of RNA structure in the region
preceding the TIS facilitates efﬁcient initiation and translation.
Equivalent depression of secondary structure was observed in
transcripts that exhibited a high-density ribosome proﬁle in only
one of the two growth conditions tested, rich or amino acid-starved
media (Fig. S5), suggesting that low RNA structure facilitates the
potential for regulated high protein expression. We also tested
a subset of the HiConf set with 165 genes with detectable but
low ribosome tag densities (Ribosomelow). RibosomelOW exhibited
much less pronounced depression in predicted secondary structure
(Fig. 2C2) and NSS index (Fig. S6B), suggesting that there is
less selection against secondary structure for lower expression
genes.

Equivalent results were observed for subsets of HiConf
partitioned based on protein expression (Fig. S4) rather than
ribosome densities. Based on proteome-scale western analysis of
TAP and GFP tagged proteins (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003),
we generated subsets of HiConf with high (Proteinhigh) and
low but detectable (Proteinlow) protein expression. Like the
Ribosomehigi1 set, Proteinhigi1 showed depressed secondary structure
upstream of the TIS whereas Proteinl0W had much less pronounced
depression.

Transcript sequences for genes with high-conﬁdence
TISs were also examined in Drosophila melanogaster and
Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Depression of NSS index (Fig. S10)
and predicted secondary structure (Fig. S11A) were observed in
the region upstream of the TIS and this was more pronounced for
high-TRII score and high protein expression TISs; suppression of
secondary structure was also observed downstream of the AUG
start codon (Fig. S11B; see Section 3.2). These effects were more
pronounced in D.melanogaster than Spombe, suggesting that the

contributions of mRNA secondary structure to translation initiation
may vary between species.

3.2 Downstream of AUG

Our observations above indicate that genes with high TRII scores,
high ribosome densities and high protein expression beneﬁt from
depressed RNA secondary structure upstream of the TIS. We were
interested whether depression of RNA structure downstream of the
TIS is also beneﬁcial. This was of particular interest since previous
studies (Kochetov et al., 2007; Kozak, 1990) have suggested
that elevated secondary structure in the region 13—17 nucleotides
downstream of the TIS can facilitate TIS recognition by the
ribosome, particularly for poorer context TISs.

We applied the RNAfold algorithm to the subsets TRIIhigi1 and
TRIIlOW but in this case, the algorithm was applied to +1 to +60
relative to the TIS. We used a modiﬁed version of RNAfold in which
we only collected the probabilities of base pairing downstream of
each nucleotide position (DownBPP; see Section 2). In considering
scanning of the ribosome from 5’ to 3’, we were interested in
the probability of downstream base pairing given that upstream
positions would likely be protected by the ribosome footprint. Also,
unlike our earlier analysis, we did not apply the rank-order ﬁlter
to the RNAfold output because we wished to preserve nucleotide
position information given that previous studies have implicated
as important the region near nucleotides 13—17 downstream of the
TIS. Instead of using the rank-order ﬁlter, we computed for each
nucleotide position the mean DownBPP in each test set TRIIhigh,
TRIIIOW and Randomogs.

When compared to Randomogs, we observed a depression in
predicted RNA secondary structure in the critical region +10 to
+20. This depression was most pronounced for highly expressed
genes—TRIIhigi1 (Figs. 2E, S9) and Ribosomehigi1 (Fig. S7)— and
least pronounced for low expression genes—TRII 10W (Figs. 2E, S9)
and RibosomelOW (Fig. S7). These results suggest that efﬁcient
translation is facilitated by reduced RNA structure in the region
immediately downstream of the ribosome (approximately nucleotide
positions +10 to +20 downstream of the TIS). Our results agree
with previous observations (Kochetov et al., 2007; Kozak, 1990) that
poorer sequence context TISs have elevated predicted RNA structure
downstream of the TIS. However, it may be more appropriate
to consider the predicted RNA structure in TRIIlOW sequences
to be less depressed rather than elevated—TRII 10W sequences
show depressed predicted RNA structure when compared with
Randomogs sequences, but less depressed RNA structure when
compared to TRIIhigh. Hence, for suboptimal start sites, there may
be a balance between two opposing selection forces: (i) selection
for depressed secondary structure to increase translation rates and
(ii) selection for elevated secondary structure in the downstream
region to create a partial barrier to scanning and thereby increase
the likelihood of translation initiation.

Other studies have suggested that in addition to RNA structure
properties, efﬁciency of translation is inﬂuenced by selection for
codons with high tRNA adaptation indices (tAI) (Tuller et al.,
2010a, b) and clustering of codons on mRNAs that use the same
tRNA (Cannarrozzi et al., 2010). Examination of mean tAI indices
for TRIIhigi1 and TRII low, as well as Ribosomehigi1 and Ribosomelow,
and Proteinhigi1 and ProteinlOW (Fig. S12) suggests that, as expected,
the higher expression genes show selection for higher tAI index

codons, which are better represented in the cell’s tRNA pool. The
higher expression genes also show selection for clustering of codons
that utilize the same tRNA (Fig. S13).

3.3 Conclusions

For highly expressed genes, there is selection against RNA
secondary structure upstream of the TIS (positions —40 to — 1) and
in a critical region downstream of the TIS (positions +10 to +20).
Reduction in secondary structure may facilitate efﬁcient initiation
by the ribosome. Elevation of A and depression of U or G content
appear to contribute to reduced RNA structure (Figs. 2F, S8).

For lower expression genes, there is less selection against RNA
secondary structure, both upstream of the TIS and in the region
predicted to be immediately downstream of the footprint of an
initiating ribosome (positions +10 to +20). The presence of
secondary structure downstream of the AUG is thought to facilitate
ribosome pausing over the start site region, increasing the likelihood
of translation initiation.

These results suggest that future algorithms for prediction of
protein translation initiation will beneﬁt from inclusion of classiﬁers
that incorporate predicted RNA structure upstream and downstream
of the TIS.

Quantification of protein-protein interactions

 

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Preparation of the datasets

The dataset of proteiniprotein complexes for developing SPA-PP was
extracted from the Dockground resource (Douguet et al., 2006), which
provides a dynamic generation of dataset of proteiniprotein complexes
based on the user-deﬁned ﬁltering criteria. To drive a high quality set of
pairwise non-redundant proteiniprotein complexes of training dataset
and testing dataset, a series of ﬁltering criteria were composed on the
Dockground resource. Only the dimeric complexes solved by X-ray
diffraction with resolutions better than 2.510% were selected. The se-
quence identity (<70%) between each two complexes was used to dis-
card redundant structures. The dimeric structures with true biological
interfaces were kept by checking the head lines of the pdb ﬁles with
remarks ‘AUTHOR DETERMINED BIOLOGICAL UNIT:
DIMERIC’ or ‘SOFTWARE DETERMINED QUATERNARY
STRUCTURE: DIMERIC’ or both of them. The threshold number
of interface residues were set to be >30. The resulting dataset contains
3045 dimeric proteiniprotein complexes, including 2648 homodimers
and 397 heterodimers (Supplementary Table S1). This dataset was ran-
domly partitioned into two equal subsamples, one subsample is assigned
as the training dataset and the other one as the testing dataset (named
as testing datasetl).

In addition to the aforementioned testing datasetl, a benchmark data-
set for testing was also collected. It combines three available proteini
protein benchmarks. The ﬁrst benchmark is the non-redundant
proteiniprotein docking benchmark version 4.0 (Hwang et al., 2010),
which contains 176 complexes. The second benchmark is the
Dockground benchmark (Gao et al., 2007), which contains 233 com-
plexes. The third benchmark is an afﬁnity benchmark (Kastritis et al.,
2011), which contains 144 complexes with measured dissociation con-
stants. By keeping one entry if there are overlaps among the pdb lists
of these three proteiniprotein benchmarks, the remaining 325 complexes
constitute our benchmark dataset (Supplementary Table S2), which
covers all available benchmarks of proteiniprotein complexes. For con-
venience, this benchmark dataset was named as testing dataset2. Both
testing datasetl and dataset2 were used for the validation of ability of
binding pose prediction for SPA-PP, and among the testing dataset2, the
144 complexes with experimental measured afﬁnities were used for the
validation of the ability of binding afﬁnity prediction for SPA-PP.

2.2 Preparation of docking decoys

To develop SPA-PP, an ensemble of decoys is needed to calculate the ISR
and carry out the iteration algorithm. The RosettaDock v3.2.1 was taken
as the structure optimizing and docking tool (Chaudhury et al., 2011;
Gray et al., 2003) for both the training and testing complexes. Three steps
were performed. First, each docking partner of the complex was prepared
in isolation for optimizing their side-chain conformations before docking
using the pre-packing protocol. Second, the pre-packed complexes were
then relaxed and minimized with high resolution by the reﬁnement proto-
col. Third, the reﬁned structures were taken as the starting structures for
the docking using the local docking perturbation protocol. The smaller
protein was deﬁned as the docking ligand in the complex, and the other
was assigned as the receptor, which was kept ﬁxed during docking.
Thousand ligand orientations for each complex were generated by dock-
ing. Other docking parameters were set as default. The generated decoys
are normally structured diversely with 1”,” (interface Ca root-mean-
square displacement between the native conformation and docked
decoys) ranging from small to large values. Three example complexes
with small, middle and large number of interfacial residues are shown
in Supplementary Figure S2 to illustrate the structural diversity of the
decoys.

2.3 Derivation of observed statistical potentials

The knowledge-based statistical scoring function needs a set of distance-
dependent atom-pair potentials to quantify the interactions. In our work,
the initial observed atom-pair potentials were directly derived from the
Boltzmann relation widely used in the knowledge-based statistical poten-
tials (Jiang et al., 2002; Koppensteiner and Sippl, 1998; Su et al., 2009;
Zhang et al., 2005a), which is

fZ”“'(r) is the observed number density of atom-pair k within a spherical
shell between r and r + Sr, and the ,f,”“'(R) is the number density within
the sphere of the reference state where there are no interactions between
atoms. The former can be directly extracted from the database of pro-
teiniprotein complexes, whereas the later was obtained based on the ap-
proximation that the atom-pair k is uniformly distributed in the sphere of
the reference state (Sippl, 1990). Respectively, they were calculated as

where M is the total number (3045) of native proteiniprotein complexes
extracted from the Dockground resource, nZ’(r) and  are the numbers
of atom-pair k within the spherical shell and the reference sphere,
respectively, for a given proteiniprotein complex m, where
N27 = Zrnﬂr). V(r) = 3171((1‘ + Ar)3 — r3) and V(R) = 3—‘71R3 are the
volumes of the spherical shell and the reference sphere, respectively,
where Ar is the bin size and R is the radius of sphere. Ar and R are
set as 0.3 A and 6.4 A, respectively. There are 14 spherical shells with bin
size 0.3 A from the shortest radius 2.2/OX. Based on the deﬁnition of atom
type by SYBYL (Clark et al., 1989), 12 atom types were used to cover the
heavy atoms involved in proteiniprotein interactions (Supplementary
Table S3), these atom types were converted from PDB ﬁles by
OpenBabel (Guha et al., 2006). These atom types lead to 78 types of
atom pairs for the proteiniprotein interactions. There are 1092 types of
interaction pair by multiplying the number of atom pairs (78) and the
number of shells (14).

2.4 Derivation of expected statistical potentials

The observed statistical potentials have its limitations, as the statistical
potentials extracted from Equation (1) is not exactly the expected poten-
tials that nature uses to stabilize the complexes (Thomas and Dill, 1996a).
The origin of this problem lies in the construction of the reference state
where the atom pairs are uniformly distributed and independent of each
other (Sippl, 1990). In reality, the protein interactions involve the
excluded volume, sequences and connectivity. Thus, the observed statis-
tical potentials are always not equal to the expected potentials (Thomas
and Dill, 1996b). To solve the reference state issue and improve the stat-
istical potentials, earlier efforts (Goldstein et al., 1992; Huang and Zou,
2008; Muegge and Martin, 1999; Thomas and Dill, 1996a; Zhang et al.,
2005b) taking different approaches have been devoted in optimizing the
statistical potentials. An effective way is to take into account both native
and non-native conformations (decoys) (Goldstein et al., 1992; Huang
and Zou, 2008; Thomas and Dill, 1996a) based on the energy landscape
theory (Goldstein et al., 1992; Levy et al., 2004) that the native conform-
ation should be sufﬁciently favored over alternative non-native structures

thermodynamically. However, none of the earlier works combined both
the speciﬁcity and afﬁnity to discriminate native conformation over non-
native conformations of proteiniprotein docking. In this work, we
considered the importance of both the afﬁnity for stabilizing the native
conformation and the speciﬁcity of discrimination over non-native
conformations to optimize the statistical potentials. We used the iterative
method (Huang and Zou, 2008; Thomas and Dill, 1996a) shown in the
next subsection to realize the optimization.

Similarly as the observed statistical potentials, the expected statistical
potentials are calculated as

where g?” (r) is the expected pair distribution function from all the native
and non-native conformations, which is

I {p .
g2?” r) = 

Given the population discrimination of the native and non-native con-
formations, the expected number density of atom-pair k was calculated
with Boltzmann-averaged weighting over the ensemble of conformations
(Huang and Zou, 2008; Thomas and Dill, 1996a), that is

where M is the number of native complexes aforementioned, and N is the
number of total conformations (1001, including the native conformation
and decoys) for each complex m. n represents the nth generated decoy of
the complex m. )3 is an arbitrary constant analogous to the inverse of
temperature and set as 0.1. Um" is the parameter that is assumed to be
able to discriminate the naive conformation against decoys. As discussed,
both the stability and speciﬁcity are required to form a speciﬁc functional
complex. Thus, Um" is designed as a combination parameter coupling the
afﬁnity and ISR, which is given by

Umn = yEmn + Amn 

where Em" is the energy score of the proteiniprotein conformation
(nth decoy of the complex m) by summing over all the expected inter-
atomic pair potentials among the interface, representing the afﬁnity of the
proteiniprotein conformation. Am" is the ISR representing the speciﬁcity
of the proteiniprotein conformation (Wang and Verkhivker, 2003; Wang
et al., 2007; Yan and Wang, 2012). y is a parameter that balances the
values of Em" and AW, and is set as 0.01 because of the ratio of average
Em" and Am". Em" and AW, are calculated as

 

Em" = Z Z tk(r)u;‘.(r) (10)
A» 1’
Arm: — am :EEm"  

tk(r) represents the occurrence times of the atom-pair interaction between
the proteiniprotein interface. am is a scaling factor that accounts for the
contribution of the entropy to the speciﬁcity (am 2 4S1", where Sm is the
conformational entropy of the complex m) (Wang and Verkhivker, 2003).
Here, am approximately depends on the number of interfacial residues
(am ~  of the native proteiniprotein conformation of the complex m.
An interfacial residue is deﬁned if any atom of this residue in one partner
of the native proteiniprotein conformation is within 10  from the other
partner. am normalizes the increase of ISR with the number of interfacial
residues. (SEW, is the energy gap between the energy of a given conform-
ation Em" and the average energy of the conformation ensemble < Efn > ,

including the native conformation and all the decoys of the complex m,
AEm" is the energy roughness or the width of the energy distribution of
conformation ensemble, namely, (SEW, = Em" — <Efn > and
AE,,,,, : (I <(Efn)2 > 7 <E;;,>3, < > means the average over the ensemble of
conformations.

2.5 Optimization of scoring function

The basic idea of the iterative method here is to circumvent the inaccess-
ible reference state problem by improving the statistical pair potentials
until they are able to discriminate native binding mode from decoys. The
expected potentials obtained from the ensemble of conformations gener-
ally are not equal to the potentials from the observed native conform-
ations. The difference between the expected statistical potentials and the
observed statistical potentials, as well as the iterative equation can be
expressed by

mm) = um) — uz’l‘rr) (12)

u§f+1)(r)= 14(1) + mum) (13)

exp

uj;(r) is the expected distance-dependant potentials uk (r) starting from
i = 0, and the new expected statistical distance-dependant pair potentials
uff+1)(r) was taken to compute the Em" and Am", as well as Um", through
Equations (9711). In return, the Um" was used to update the expected pair
potentials through Equations (579). Thus, the expected pair potentials
were adjusted with the difference Auj;(r) at each iteration step. The x
controls the speed of the convergence and was set as 0.1. The iterative
procedure was repeated until the success rate of the best-scored conform-
ations passing the high-quality accuracy of CAPRI criteria
(Supplementary Table S4) converges to a value (normally over 98.0%).
The ﬁnal set of the expected pair potentials constitutes the optimized
scoring function of proteiniprotein interactions, i.e. SPA-PP.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Optimized scoring function

A straightforward way to validate the effectiveness of the itera—
tive procedure on the improvement of the scoring function is to
show the evolution of the average RMSD of the best—scored
poses and the success rate of the best—scored poses passing high
accuracy of CAPRI evaluation criteria (Fig. 2a). It can be seen
that the success rate increases from 93.3% and converges to
98.1%, whereas the average RMSD decreases from 0.53 and
approaches to 0.17 as the adjusting of the scoring function via
iteration. Almost all the best—scored poses of the proteiniprotein
complexes in the training set are identiﬁed as the native conform—
ations by the optimized scoring function (SPA—PP), and the
structures of the best—scored poses are identical to their native
conformations with low RMSDs. This indicates that the accur—
acy of the statistical expected knowledge—based pair potentials
are improved gradually as the iteration continues until the con—
vergence is reached.

Our optimization strategy couples the adjustments of the af—
finity and speciﬁcity simultaneously. We can see that the distri—
bution of ISR value of pro—optimized and optimized SPA—PP is
clearly separated, and the average value of ISRs for the native
poses increases from 5.3 to 7.3 (Fig. 2b). It implies that the spe—
ciﬁcity of native conformation is more obvious, whereas the sta—
bility is more strengthened by the optimized SPA—PP. The results
validate that the performance of SPA—PP is optimized and

To assess how different the docking predictions ranked by a
new scoring function from a random order, Feliu and Oliva.
(2010) proposed a statistical assessment of the performance of
a scoring function on determining the number of near—native
conformations among the top—ranked conformations. In this
work, we used its P—value calculation [details are in the Feliu
and Oliva (2010)] to get the number of successful cases among
our testing datasetl (320 complexes). A successful case is deﬁned
by considering at least one hit located in the top—ranked decoys
of the complex. The success curves (Supplementary Fig. S3)
show that the successful rate of optimized SPA—PP is much
better than that of random ordering. Also, compared with pre—
optimized SPA—PP, the successful rate of optimized SPA—PP is
improved after optimization. The statistical assessment indicates
that the optimization strategy is successful, and the optimized
SPA—PP could be an accurate scoring function on the predictions
of native pose identification and binding afﬁnity ranking.

In the proteiniprotein docking problem, scoring functions are
generally used for two applications: (i) to score and rank the
binding poses generated by the docking programs and (ii) to
predict and explain the experimentally determined proteinipro—
tein afﬁnities. Thus, to evaluate the performance of SPA—PP, two
kinds of tests related to corresponding applications are carried
out, and the testing results are shown later.

3.2 Binding pose prediction

The purpose of proteiniprotein docking is to look for the native
or near—native binding mode for the assembly proteins. Whether
the scoring function can select out the best—scored binding pose
that resembles the native conformation determines the scoring
and ranking ability of the scoring function. Ideally, the scoring
function should be transferable and work equally for the diverse
proteiniprotein complexes. For this reason, the performance of
binding pose prediction for SPA—PP is tested on two diverse
testing datasets (testing datasetl and dataset2, for details see
Section 2).

The performances of identifying the native pose are compared
among the optimized SPA—PP, pro—optimized SPA—PP and the
energy function implemented in RosettaDock3.2.1 (Table 1).
Also, to emphasize the importance of ISR on the optimization
of scoring function, the optimized scoring function, which is

Table 1. Success rates (%) of identifying the native or near-native con-
formations for testing datasetl and testing dataset2

 

 

Scoring function Datasetl Dataset2
Optimized SPA-PP 97.6 97.3
Optimized Afﬁnity-PP 97.4 97.2
Pre-optimized SPA-PP 92.6 88.1
RosettaDock 97.2 96.9

 

obtained by only taking afﬁnity into the optimization (called
as Affinity—PP), is also listed for comparison, i.e. Equation 9
becomes Um" = yEmn. The success rates of the native pose iden—
tiﬁcation for both testing datasets show that the optimized SPA—
PP performs much better than pro—optimized SPA—PP and even
better than RosettaDock whose force fields perform extremely
well for protein folding and protein assembly over other energy
functions (King et al., 2012; Schueler—Furman et al., 2005). This
suggests that optimized SPA—PP is successful on the ability to
identify native or near—native binding poses. The comparison of
Affinity—PP and SPA—PP demonstrates that incorporation of ISR
into the optimization strategy improves the performance of the
scoring function on the identiﬁcation of native or near—native
binding poses. The high success rate also means that optimized
SPA—PP is effective to discriminate the native binding pose
against decoys, namely, able to characterize the speciﬁcity.

3.3 Binding affinity prediction

In addition to the prediction of binding pose, the prediction of
binding afﬁnity is another important application of proteinipro—
tein scoring function (Kastritis and Bonvin, 2010). It determines
the accuracy of binding energy predicted by the scoring function
compared with the experimental measurements. Because of scal—
ing, the scoring functions usually can not reproduce the absolute
values of experimental binding affinity; the Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient (C P) between the predicted and experimental mea—
sured binding afﬁnities was computed. Among the 144 com—
plexes of afﬁnity benchmark set (Kastritis et al., 2011), 72
complexes are deﬁned as rigid docking complexes with
[rm f 1.0A (interface Ca root—mean—square displacement be—
tween the bound and unbound complexes), and the remaining
are classiﬁed as ﬂexible docking complexes. This benchmark set
of binding afﬁnities contains a diverse set of proteiniprotein
complexes with reliable experimental binding afﬁnities and for
the ﬁrst time provides an opportunity for evaluating the perform—
ance of scoring functions on the binding afﬁnity prediction.
The correlations between the predicted and experimental affi—
nities are shown in Table 2. The results of DFIRE (Liu et al.,
2004a) and PMF (Su et al., 2009) were obtained from the litera—
ture (Moal et al., 2011), and for consistence with this literature,
the complexes lUUG, lIQD, 1NSN, 1DE4, lMlO, lNCA and
1NB5 were also excluded in the calculations. Compared with
RosettaDock, as well as other two scoring functions DFIRE
and PMF (Moal et al., 2011), the performance of SPA—PP for
the rigid docking complexes ranks best with C P = 0.63 (Table 2
and Fig. 3), and the C P for all the benchmark set is only lower
than that of RosettaDock. The results indicate that SPA—PP is

Experimental affinity (kcal/mol)

Fig. 3. Pearson correlation between the predicted and experimental bind-
ing afﬁnities for the rigid docking complexes. The correlation coefﬁcient
(C p) is 0.63 (statistical signiﬁcance P<0.001). The predicted afﬁnity is
obtained by scaling the binding scores with a linear equa-
tion:y=0.018 X —4.79, which is a ﬁtting equation based on the experi-
mental afﬁnities

not only capable of discriminating the native conformation
against non—native conformations but also accurately predicting
the binding afﬁnities for proteiniprotein binding without large
conformational change. The comparison of Affinity—PP and
SPA—PP demonstrates that ISR is an important factor to
improve the performance of the scoring function. The specificity
is critical to the proteiniprotein interactions and necessary to be
incorporated to the optimization of scoring function. It is worth
noticing that for ﬂexible binding, SPA—PP, as well as other scor—
ing functions, performs poorly with C ps < 0.3. This is reasonable,
as the scoring function only captures the features of static struc—
ture and can not easily incorporate the information of conform—
ational change because of ﬂexibility. RosettaDock includes
minimization function during the docking process. This mini—
mization is restricted to the side—chain rotamers. That means
RosettaDock considers certain degrees of ﬂexibility into the
docking process. This might be the reason why RosettaDock
seems to be better in semi—rigid docking than others
(Supplementary Table S5). However, all scoring functions,

including RosettaDock, are bad in scoring performance on the
docking with large conformational changes. The computation—
ally efﬁcient treatment of large conformational changes during
binding still remains a challenge (Zacharias, 2010).

4 CONCLUSION

In this work, we developed a scoring function for proteiniprotein
interactions, named as SPA—PP. The development strategy of
SPA—PP takes into account of both speciﬁcity and afﬁnity of
proteiniprotein binding. It represents a significant advance
over the previous investigations on proteiniprotein binding inter—
actions and scoring functions, which only focused on afﬁnity for
development. Also, we used the largest set of high—quality pro—
teiniprotein structures so far for training the scoring function. It
makes SPA—PP independent on the training set and more general
for applications. The remarkable performance of SPA—PP was
validated by testing the ability on the predictions of native pose
and binding afﬁnity. The success of SPA—PP demonstrates that
the speciﬁcity is critical to the proteiniprotein interactions and
necessary to be incorporated to the scoring function and the
computational design of the proteiniprotein interactions. SPA—
PP is a kind of statistical pair—potentials, which are discrete po—
tentials dependent on the distances between the interacting atom
pairs. The statistical pair—potentials incorporate multiple energy
terms, such as van der Waals interactions, electrostatic inter—
actions and hydrophobic interactions, into one potential energy
term. Therefore, the computational docking procedure with
SPA—PP could cost less computational time if SPA—PP is imple—
mented into the sampling and ranking of proteiniprotein
binding.

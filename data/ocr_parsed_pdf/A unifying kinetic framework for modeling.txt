ABSTRACT

Motivation: Oxidoreductases are a fundamental class of enzymes
responsible for the catalysis of oxidation—reduction reactions, crucial
in most bioenergetic metabolic pathways. From their common root in
the ancient prebiotic environment, oxidoreductases have evolved into
diverse and elaborate protein structures with specific kinetic proper-
ties and mechanisms adapted to their individual functional roles and
environmental conditions. While accurate kinetic modeling of oxidor-
eductases is thus important, current models suffer from limitations to
the steady-state domain, lack empirical validation or are too specia-
lized to a single system or set of conditions.

Results: To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unifying
modeling framework for kinetic descriptions of oxidoreductases. The
framework is based on a set of seven elementary reactions that (i) form
the basis for 69 pairs of enzyme state transitions for encoding various
specific microscopic intra-enzyme reaction networks (micro-models),
and (ii) lead to various specific macroscopic steady-state kinetic equa-
tions (macro-models) via thermodynamic assumptions. Thus, a syner-
gistic bridge between the micro and macro kinetics can be achieved,
enabling us to extract unitary rate constants, simulate reaction vari-
ance and validate the micro-models using steady-state empirical data.
To help facilitate the application of this framework, we make available
RedoxMech: a MathematicaTM software package that automates the
generation and customization of micro-models.

1 INTRODUCTION

Oxidoreductase, the ﬁrst enzyme class in the Enzyme
Commission Nomenclature (EC l.x.x.x, henceforth referred to
as EC 1), consists of enzymes responsible for the catalytic trans-
fer of electrons from an electron donor molecule to an electron
acceptor molecule. The universal presence of oxidoreductases in
the energy-producing pathways of bacteria, archaea and eukary-
otes suggests that these proteins arose earlier during the process
of biogenesis, and are thus essential for life (Berry, 2002). In the

EC 1, oxidoreductases are classiﬁed according to the types of
donor and acceptor molecules in the particular oxidationireduc-
tion (redox) reaction that they participate in (http://www.brenda—
enzymes.org), although the kinetics and regulatory behaviors of
enzymes in the same classiﬁcation may differ signiﬁcantly across
different organisms, or even across different tissues in the same
organism (Benard et al., 2006; Vinogradov, 2008).

To understand the functional role an oxidoreductase has
within a pathway, and to characterize its differences from
other oxidoreductases, it is necessary to be able to predict accur-
ately its dynamics over a range of conditions. However, a full
realization of the dynamics of an oxidoreductase is currently
hindered by (i) the lack of detailed structural and mechanistic
information on most of the oxidoreductases, e. g. complex
IiNADH dehydrogenase (Brandt, 2006), (ii) the technological
limitations in obtaining the speciﬁc elementary kinetic rate con-
stants and (iii) the computational limitations associated with mo-
lecular dynamics and other physical simulations over large
spatial and temporal scales (Klepeis et al., 2009). To bypass
these limitations, simpliﬁed models are used, which typically
follow either the macroscopic modeling approach of deducing
a steady-state velocity equation to represent the rate of the reac-
tion, or the microscopic kinetic approach of deﬁning a system of
intra-enzyme processes to represent the detailed kinetic mechan-
isms of the enzyme.

A macroscopic steady-state velocity equation is a mathemat-
ical relationship between reactant concentrations and empirically
derived kinetic parameters that provides a steady-state determin-
istic solution to the ﬂux of the reactants through the enzyme. The
relationship can be a simple hyperbolic function, such as the
MichaelisiMenten kinetic equation, or a more complex function
derived from a macroscopic approximation of many elementary
reactions at steady state (Chen et al., 2010). Kinetic models based
on steady-state velocity equations are widely used and published
because steady-state kinetic parameters are relatively easy to ac-
quire Via available measurement techniques, and the steady-state
‘snap-shots’ of their dynamics can readily be compared (Sin
et al., 2009). For example, in our previous work (Chang et al.,
2011), a two-substrate and two-product (Bi Bi) steady-state vel-
ocity equation termed the chemiosmotic rate law was derived for
the chemiosmotic oxidoreductase complexes in the mitochon-
dria, and corresponding enzyme assay protocols were developed
and implemented to estimate the values of the kinetic parameters
in the rate law and enable comparison across various cell lines.
However, steady-state velocity equations are based on many ap-
proximations and steady-state assumptions that severely limit

their range of applicability. Furthermore, although deterministic
solutions can satisfactorily describe the average behavior of the
enzyme over many ensembles that are consistent with in vitro
experimental conditions, they might not accurately capture
in vivo conditions within a cell or a cell’s organelle, where the
signiﬁcantly lower volume and thus fewer copies of the enzyme
and its reactants and stochastic ﬂuctuations may become import-
ant (Rao and Arkin, 2003). Thus, many kinetic features of the
enzyme could be over-estimated (e. g. the parameter values),
under-estimated (e. g. stochastic variability of the velocity) or al-
together lost (e. g. transient phase of the reaction).

Microscopic kinetic models avoid the various steady-state
approximations by explicitly accounting for the intra-enzyme re-
actions and solving the corresponding system of ordinary differ-
ential equations (ODEs; Selivanov et al., 2009, 2011). Kinetic
models based on intra-enzyme reactions not only can produce
a more complete deterministic description of the enzyme kinetics,
but can also be used in conjunction with Monte-Carlo methods
such as Gillespie’s stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) to pro-
duce stochastic time series, which can capture the intrinsic vari-
ability of the catalyzed reaction (Ransac et al., 2008, 2010).
However, in contrast to the velocity equations, the rate constants
of the intra-enzyme reactions are not only harder to obtain ex-
perimentally (Mulquiney and Kuchel, 2003), but also less useful
in comparison between models owing to the lack of standards
between the various possible enzyme mechanisms.

Here we present a novel framework for modeling oxidoreduc-
tase-catalyzed reactions that uses a synergistic combination of
both macroscopic and microscopic kinetic model descriptions
of the reaction system (henceforth referred to as macro-model
and micro-model, respectively) to obviate the aforementioned
modeling limitations. At the core of this unifying framework is
a basis of seven elementary reactions. This basis can be used to
express various mechanisms of oxidoreductase by (i) deﬁning the
speciﬁc micro-model out of the 69 pairs of feasible enzyme
microstate transitions spanned from the seven elementary reac-
tions, and (ii) inferring the corresponding speciﬁc macro-model
through temporal separation and non-equilibrium thermo-
dynamic assumptions. We show that, by sharing the same ab-
straction, the unitary rate constants of the micro-model can be
estimated from the experimentally determinable steady-state par-
ameters of the macro-model to produce the same steady-state
output. In contrast, the intrinsic stochasticity of the enzyme cap-
tured by the micro-model simulations can be superimposed onto
the macro-model time series. Additionally, we show how well-
known mechanisms can be encoded by the micro-model, how
these mechanisms differ in their transient and steady-state do-
mains and how they can be combined to simulate a cascade or a
supercomplex. The application of this framework is facilitated by
a MathematicaTM software package, RedoxMech, which gener-
ates customizable micro-models through simple xCellerator-like
arrow notations for chemical reactions.

2 METHODS
2.1 EC 1 reaction decomposition

2.1.] General processes In general, an EC 1 enzyme binds to donor
and acceptor electron carriers (e-carriers) and facilitates the ﬂow of

electrons between them and through the enzymesubstrate complex by
a series of internal redox steps with an overall chemical reaction of

l)er’Cd + var) 0X : vdoDox + VarAmd

where D” and D’”" are the oxidized and reduced species of the donor
e-carrier reactant (D), A” and AW" are the oxidized and reduced species
of the acceptor e-carrier reactant (A), and 114,, 1140, um, and 1),, represent
their stoichiometric reaction coefﬁcients, respectively. In this work, we
focus on the derivation of the framework for the most common Bi Bi
reaction where the stoichiometric reaction coefﬁcients are all set to the
value of 1, but note that other coefﬁcient variations (and thus molecu-
larity reactions such as Bi Uni, Bi Ter, Ter Ter and higher) can readily be
extended from the methods demonstrated in this framework.

While the exact sequences of the internal redox reactions are usually
unknown and highly variable across different EC 1 enzymes, a universal
mode of operation is that electrons are transferred to and from an oxi-
doreductase complex after the necessary reactant e-carriers are bound
and situated within distance for electron tunneling between the external
e-carrier and a close-by internal redox center (Chang et al., 2011). Thus,
the catalytic operation of an EC 1 enzyme can be decomposed into three
spatially distinct processes (Fig. 1):

(1) Binding/unbinding of donor and acceptor e-carriers to/from the
complex.

(2) Electron transfer between the e-carriers and the boundary redox
centers of the complex.

(3) Central ‘black-box’ catalytic electron transfer between the redox
centers.

This separation of fundamental processes enables elementary reactions of
the overall chemical reaction to be deﬁned below.

2.1.2 Elementary reactions A set of seven microscopic reactions can
be obtained through the deﬁned boundaries of the three fundamental
processes (Fig. 1). Of the seven, four are associated with the

 

Fig. 1. An EC 1 reaction. The Bi Bi oxidoreductase reaction is shown
here as the elementary interactions between a representative EC 1
enzyme, and its donor and acceptor e-carrier reactants, D and A, respect-
ively. The blue lines represent the path of the electron transfer, whereas
the blue shades represent the relative redox potential (the darker, the
higher). The introduction of the two internal redox centers, RH and
RL, allows one to spatially separate the overall reaction into three general
processes: I. reactants binding/unbinding; II. e-transfers between bound
reactants and internal redox centers; and III. central catalytic e-transfer
between internal redox centers. Within the three processes, one can fur-
ther enumerate seven elementary reaction pairs shown here with number
indexes, where 141 represent elementary binding reaction pairs (grey
double arrows), and SP7 represent three elementary redox reaction
pairs (blue/black arrows)

Modeling framework for oxidoreductase

 

reactant-binding/unbinding processes, whereas three are associated with
the electron transfer processes. At the microscopic level, the binding/un-
binding processes of the e-carrier reactants associated with an EC 1
enzyme can be considered independently as four individual elementary
reactions, which are expressed (with their forward and reverse unitary
rate constants) as

D’M + Enz :‘ D’M Enz (kam, krDm) (1)
D0)“ + Enz :‘ DoxEnz (kaax,krDax) (2)
A” + Enz :‘ onEnz (kam‘,krAax) (3)
Am" + Enz : A’”dEnz (mtg/cry” (4)

For the internal electron transfer processes of the complex, a ‘high po-
tential’ redox center RH and a ‘low potential’ redox center RL are intro-
duced to represent the internal redox centers at the boundaries next to the
reactant-binding sites (Fig. 1) such that the overall chemical reaction can
be partitioned into three subreactions:

vdoD’”d + R; : vdoDox + R], (ka,RH,krD,RH) (5)
1%,; + R: : R; + R; (kﬁm,kr.m) (6)
R1: + vavox :‘ R: + var/1’“! (kfRL,AakrRL,A) (7)

where Equation (5) describes the elementary electron transfer reaction
between the donor e-carrier and the RH redox center, Equation (6) de-
scribes the lumped catalytic electron transfer reaction and Equation (7)
describes the elementary electron transfer reaction between the R L redox
center and the acceptor e-carrier. In the absence of additional knowledge
of the catalytic process encapsulated in the lumped reaction, Equation (6)
can be considered as an approximated elementary reaction for simplicity.
Equations (177) form the core kinetic description of the framework from
which both microscopic and macroscopic models can be derived, as de-
tailed in the following subsections.

2.2 EC 1 micro-model

The elementary reactions can be explicitly and individually modeled to
give the microscopic behavior of the reaction system. The different ways
that the seven elementary reactions can be interconnected to enable the
ﬂow of electrons between the donor and acceptor e-carriers give rise to a
variety of feasible kinetic mechanisms belonging to EC 1. Thus, to rep-
resent all kinetic mechanisms under this framework, we encode the intra-
enzyme reaction network of a prototypical EC 1 enzyme in terms of all
possible enzymesubstrate redox states (henceforth referred to as the
microstates) and the transitions between them. The transition probabil-
ities are the unitary rate constants of the corresponding elementary reac-
tions. In a general-to-speciﬁc approach, this ‘complete’ intra-enzyme
reaction network can, in turn, be used as a generating model from

Table 1. Enzyme states of the micro-model (microstates)

which all other intra-enzyme reaction networks representing speciﬁc EC
1 mechanisms can be derived as reduced subsets by pruning certain tran-
sitions. The enumeration of all possible microstates and transitions within
this framework proceeds as follows.

2.2.] Microstates Because each EC 1 enzyme has two boundary
redox centers (RH, RL) that can be either reduced or oxidized for 22
states, and two binding sites (donor, acceptor) that can each be in one
of three states (empty, bound reduced e-carrier, bound oxidized e-carrier)
for 32 states, there is a grand total of 22 x 32 or 36 microstates for an EC 1
enzyme complex. The 36 microstates are categorized by their molecularity
(4 unimolecular, 16 bimolecular and 16 trimolecular) and enumerated in
Table 1.

2.2.2 State Transitions From the categories of microstates, one can
form 16 uni-to-bimolecular reversible transitions and 32 bi-to-trimolecu—
lar reversible transitions for a total of 48 transition pairs representing the
binding reactions for an EC 1 complex, each pair consisting of one for-
ward and one reverse transition between two different states. These bind-
ing transitions can be sorted by the molecularity of the products (bi for
bimolecular and ter for trimolecular) and the binding sequence of the
reactant e-carriers (donor ﬁrst, acceptor ﬁrst, donor second, acceptor
second). Thus, the unitary rate constants for the binding transitions
may be classiﬁed as follows: bi-donor ﬁrst (D1), bi-acceptor first (A1),
ter-donor second (D2) and ter-acceptor second (A2). In addition to the
binding transitions, there are 21 feasible electron transfer transitions
pairs, which can be organized by their molecularity (uni, bi and ter)
and the reaction type {donor boundary [Equation (5)], catalytic
[Equation (6)] and acceptor boundary [Equation (7)]}. The unitary rate
constants for the electron transfer reactions are classiﬁed as follows: uni-
catalytic transfer (UT), bi-donor boundary (BD), bi-acceptor boundary
(BA), bi-catalytic transfer (BT), ter-donor boundary (TD), ter-acceptor
boundary (TA) and ter-catalytic transfer (TT). Table 2 provides a short
categorized summary of all 69 possible state transitions, while detailed
listings of elementary reaction equations for each organizational group
can be found in Appendix B of Supplementary Materials. From this set
of feasible state transitions, speciﬁc intra-enzyme reaction network can be
deﬁned through the unitary rate constants, dictating which transitions are
more probable than others. Several prominent cases, out of a spectrum of
possible mechanisms, are shown in Section 3.

2.3 EC 1 macro-model

The seven elementary reactions can also be combined into a steady-state
velocity equation to represent a speciﬁc macro-model, provided that the
macroscopic relationships between the elementary reactions are deﬁned.
Although an exact equation can be derived from the intra-enzyme reac-
tion network of a micro-model through the use of the KingiAltman
method (Cornish-Bowden, 1977), the resulting equation ends up contain-
ing a complex arrangement of the unitary rate constants instead of the
experimentally measurable kinetic parameters (see Appendix C of

Supplementary Materials). Therefore, additional approximate but well-
posed assumptions are necessary to deduce the relationship between the
corresponding micro and macro-models in the context of measurable
parameters. Our previous work on the chemiosmotic rate law (Chang
et al., 2011) is subsumed here as the ‘canonical’ EC 1 macro-model,
and its detailed derivation, updated in the context of this framework,
can be found in Appendix A of the Supplementary Materials. Brieﬂy,
the derivation uses a combination of temporal separation of the three
general processes [(rapid) reactant binding > (intermediate) boundary
electron transfer >> (rate-limiting) central electron transfer] and non-equi-
librium thermodynamic force-to-ﬂux relationship to unify the elementary
reactions into a steady-state velocity equation with five kinetic param-
eters. This temporal separation is justiﬁable for most EC 1 enzymes.
Because the central catalytic domain typically represents multiple sequen-
tial redox centers spread across most of the space within the enzyme (Fig.
1) and the rate of electron tunneling is inversely proportional to the dis-
tance between the redox centers (Ransac et al., 2010), one can assume
that electron tunneling over shorter distances at the periphery [Equations
(5) and (7)] is fast compared with the electron tunneling over the large
distance in the central catalytic domain [Equation (6)]. In addition, at
physiological levels, e-carrier concentrations are typically at much higher
levels than the EC 1 enzyme concentration, which allows one to assume
rapid-equilibrium exchange between the free e-carrier species and the
bound e-carriers of the EC 1 enzyme complex [Equations (174) and
Fig. 1]. Alternative macro-models can be derived from the subtle differ-
ences in the assumptions applied, such as changing the kinetic mechanism
for the formation of the catalytic enzymesubstrate complexes (see
Appendix A of Supplementary Materials).

2.4 Bridging macro and micro-models: unitary rate
constants

Because the micro-model is based on the same set of seven elementary
reactions [Equations (177)] as the corresponding macro-model, the uni-
tary rate constants governing the state transitions have direct relation-
ships to the experimentally measurable steady-state kinetic parameters of
the macro-model (Appendix D of Supplementary Materials). Thus, even
though the micro-model has a much larger degree of freedom than the
macro-model (138 versus 5), once the kinetic parameters and the thermo-
dynamics of the reaction are known, one can narrow the parameter space
of the micro-model signiﬁcantly using the resulting constraints on the
unitary rate constants. For the binding reaction groups (D1, D2, A1,

A2) in Table 2, the unitary rate constants are related to the corresponding
KS saturation kinetic parameters according to the following equations:

krDl krAl
K = — = — 8
SJ) ka1, SA ka1 ( )
kr kr
Ks, AD = F11: , S,DA = Ff: (9)

For the boundary electron transfer reaction groups (BD, BA, TD, TA)
assuming no difference between electron tunneling in the bimolecular and
trimolecular states, the unitary rate constants are related to the corres-
ponding K R redox potential kinetic parameters according to the following
equations:

krBD kr TD

 

 

K = _ 10
KB kaD kaD ( )
krBA krTA
K = — = — 11
RA kaA kaA ( )

For the catalytic reaction groups (UT, BT, TT), the unitary rate constants
are related to the K6,, equilibrium constant and forward and reverse me
maximum velocity kinetic parameters according to the following
equation:

Vmaxf _ kaT _ kaT _ kaT

KL. 2 _ _ _
q Vmaxr krUT krBT krTT

 

 

(12)

While the catalytic unitary rates are calculated exactly from the parameter
values and the thermodynamics of the reaction, estimates of the order of
magnitude of the boundary electron transfer and binding rates are
required (see Appendix D of Supplementary Materials).

2.5 Experimental data

To validate the models, kinetic experiments were carried out using a
SAFAS UV mc2 spectrophotometer to measure the absorption of speciﬁc
wavelengths of the substrate and/or product of the oxidation/reduction
reaction catalyzed by the oxidoreductase of interest. The data and the
experimental protocol are described in more details in our previous work
(Chang et al., 2011). Here we use four time series of substrate depletion
corresponding to the initial concentrations of 25 MM, 50 MM, 75 MM and
100 MM of NADH and 5 MM of rat muscle mitochondria complex I. In
the comparison with the simulated time series, both the substrate and
enzyme concentrations in the time series are scaled up by a factor of 10 to
represent typical in vivo concentration levels.

2.6 Simulation

The main prediction output of either the micro or macro-model is the
time trajectory of the state variables from the solution of the ODEs. For
macro-models, a differential equation is deﬁned for each reactant con-
centration state variable based on the velocity equation of the reaction
scaled by the stoichiometry of the reactant. For micro-models, a differ-
ential equation is deﬁned for each of the 36 enzyme microstates, with each
microstate represented as the number of enzyme molecules present in that
state, each equation written as the balance between the incoming and
outgoing transitions to the microstate and each transition deﬁned by its
unitary rate constant multiplied by the microstate(s) it originated from.
Whereas ODEs based on velocity equation are simple to formulate, the
complex arrangement of transitions for micro-models could beneﬁt from
a systematic computational approach. The RedoxMech software
addresses this challenge.

2.6.] RedoxMech RedoxMech is a computational tool that allows
one to easily implement, simulate and analyze the various EC 1 micro-
models generated through the framework presented in this article. It is a

language extension and an add-on to xCellerator (Shapiro et al., 2003),
which allows it to leverage xCellerator’s simple reaction arrow notations
to programmatically generate various types of reaction mechanisms such
as mass action kinetics for elementary catalytic and non-catalytic reac-
tions and various regulatory relationships, along with catalytic reaction
mechanisms involving multiple substrates and products through kMech
(Yang et al., 2005), an earlier language extension of xCellerator.
Reactions created through RedoxMech, kMech and xCellerator nota-
tions can all be interpreted simultaneously by xCellerator into a system
of ODEs for deterministic simulation via an ODE solver such as
NDSolve, or an array of stochastic transition functions for stochastic
simulations via Gillespie’s SSA, which is an ‘exact’ stochastic method
that exhaustively simulate every reaction process based on their probabil-
ity of occurrence (Gillespie, 1977). In addition, xCellerator has the built-
in capability to export the ODEs generated in Mathematica to the widely
used SBML standard for better sharing among the modeling community.

As an xCellerator language extension, RedoxMech provides a new
modular arrow input notation for generating the intra-enzyme reaction
network of an EC 1 enzyme:

Enz
ECl [{Dre, Dox} zi {Are, on} , SSConst, Options] (13)

where Dre, Dox, Are, on, and Enz are variables one can use to specify
the name of the donor e-carrier species, acceptor e-carrier species and
enzyme, respectively. SSConst is entered as a list of known steady-state
kinetic parameters obtained for the complex (can be a blank list {}),
which is automatically converted to the appropriate unitary rate con-
stants in the intra-enzyme reaction network based on the estimation
rules described earlier. Options consists of four optional switches:
ReactionType, ManualList, RemoveList and Output. By default, the EC
1 arrow notation generates a micro-model based on the complete intra-
enzyme reaction network. However, the user may either specify a pre-
encoded (sub)set of reactions (e.g. ‘Ping-Pong’, ‘Ordered, ‘Random’)
through the Reaction Type option, or manually deﬁning a list of transition
pairs through the ManualList option. RemoveList allows the user to spe-
ciﬁcally remove any of the 69 built-in internal network transition pairs.
Output switches the output from the default ‘xCellerator’ reaction list to
pass through to xCellerator for interpretation and simulation, or a
‘Matrix’ format that can be passed alternatively to the support function
ReactionMatrix to produce a more visually informative mapping of the
intra-enzyme reaction network in terms of a matrix of state transitions. In
addition, an automatic KingiAltman method that was originally imple-
mented in Mathematica by Mulquiney and Kuchel (2003) has been
extended in RedoxMech as the function SSVelocityEq, which derives
steady-state velocity equations for speciﬁc EC 1 mechanisms directly
from the reaction matrix that the EC 1 arrow notation produces (see
example in Appendix C and Mathematica notebook in the Supplemen-
tary Materials).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Synergistic uses of micro and macro-models

3.1.] Preisteady-state kinetics To verify that the two models
can reproduce the experimental results, we show how a set of
concentration timeiseries outputs from both the complete micro-
model (all 69 transition pairs) and the general macro-model
(derived in Appendix A of Supplementary Materials) compare
with the in vitro enzyme kinetics data on the complex I of rat
muscle mitochondria homogenate obtained from our previous
work (Chang et al., 2011). The steady-state parameters of the
macro-model are fitted to the various experimental data time
series of different initial substrate concentration [NADH].

Then, they are used to constrain the unitary rate constants of
the micro-model based on the estimation rules described earlier
(a complete list of parameter values can be found in Appendix D
of Supplementary Materials). The resulting concentration time
series comparisons in Figure 2A not only show consistent agree-
ment between the two models and the experimental data, but
also show how the outputs of the two modeling approaches
differ in a predictable way. In particular, the outputs of the
micro-model are consistently ahead of the corresponding outputs
of the macro-model in the initial period. This is due to the
macro-model’s assumption of steady-state condition from the
start, whereas the micro-model explicitly models the elementary
reactions so that its output accounts ﬁrst for the preisteady-state
transient period in which there is a rapid quenching of substrate
concentration when the substrate molecules ﬁrst bind with the
ensemble of enzymes. Another way of comparing the two models
is through the simulated ﬂux time series of the enzyme reaction
that are calculated from the derivative of the reactant concentra-
tions. Figure 2B again shows general agreement in the curvatures
of the ﬂux time series except for the small offset at the start and
end of the reaction due to the preisteady-state kinetics. However,
whereas all reactants in the macro-model have the same ﬂux time

series, in the micro-model, the ﬂuxes of the reactants are not
necessarily the same, as shown by the slight difference in the
derivative of the D’Td concentration and A” concentration in
Figure 2B. This effect is a direct result of differences in the bind-
ing/unbinding sequence of the reactants in the micro-model,
which is shown even more clearly in the ﬂux time series of dif-
ferent EC 1 mechanisms in Figure 7B.

3.1.2 Stochastic ﬂuctuations A deterministic reaction model can
provide an accurate description when the stochastic ﬂuctuations
are negligible, which is typically the case with large number of
molecules in solution. Although this may be the case with in vitro
conditions, in vivo conditions within a cell or a cell’s organelle
may have signiﬁcantly lower volume and fewer molecules so that
stochastic ﬂuctuations may become important. Figure 3 shows
the distribution of 25 individual simulations of the complete
micro-model under a reaction volume of lum3, roughly the
volume of one mitochondrion. The stochastic concentration
time series are then used to ﬁnd the mean, l-SD-away and 2-
SD-away time trajectories to summarize the variance of the re-
action as shown in the overlay of the individual trajectories.
Figure 3 also shows how consistently the average of the stochas-
tic timeiseries trajectories from SSA simulation of the micro-
model overlaps and follows the time series predicted by deter-
ministic ODE simulation of the micro-model. We note that, al-
though the exactness of the SSA produces accurate statistical
results, it is computationally expensive and can become intract-
able as the reaction system size grows. Nevertheless, it is useful in
simulating smaller reaction systems and obtaining characteristic
variations for that system.

3.2 Encoding speciﬁc mechanisms of EC 1

As mentioned earlier, by selectively encoding the set of transition
pairs in the micro-model, the resulting intra-enzyme reaction
network can represent specific kinetic mechanisms of EC 1.
Here we present how the micro-model can generate and extend
the commonly used Bi Bi ternary enzyme mechanisms based on
the concise rules and nomenclature introduced by Cleland such

mean (dotted lines enclosing the region) and the output of the determin-
istic simulation (central black dashed line)

as the Ping-Pong, the Ordered Sequential and the Random
Sequential mechanisms (Cleland, 1963). Additionally, we note
that many other variations of the Bi Bi mechanisms can also
be obtained from the common ones by applying relative values
of the unitary rate constants to emulate special limiting cases, e. g.
the TheorelliChance mechanism as the special case of Ordered
Sequential mechanism.

3.2.] Ping-Pong mechanism The classical Ping-Pong mechan-
ism partitions the overall ternary enzyme reaction into (i) an
ordered sequence of binding and releasing of the ﬁrst substrate
and product, which leaves a modiﬁed form of the enzyme En’,
and (ii) a second ordered sequence of binding and releasing of
the second substrate and product, which restores the original
enzyme form En. Figure 4A shows that when the Ping-Pong
mechanism is applied to a typical oxidoreductase reaction, it
partitions the catalysis of the reaction into two distinct steps,
D"EdEn <=> DOXEn’ and En’AOX <=> EnArEd, instead of just one
central catalytic event. In the context of the micro-model, the
separation of the catalytic event means that a Ping-Pong EC 1
complex only operates within the bimolecular states.
Furthermore, the speciﬁc order of binding and releasing ensures
that there is only a unique occurrence of the seven basic transi-
tion events. However, with the introduction of two intra-enzyme
reaction centers RH and RL, there are now two possible sequence
variations for when the modiﬁed enzyme form En’ binds with
the acceptor e-carrier because En’ can undergo internal electron
transfer either before or after complexing with the second sub-
strate. From the 69 transition pairs, a Ping-Pong EC 1 complex
can be encoded using the reaction group listed in Table 2 as
shown in Figures 4B and C. The index number for each reaction
group speciﬁes a particular reaction within the reaction group
(see also Appendix B of Supplementary Materials).

Modeling framework for oxidoreductase

 

3.2.2 Ordered Sequential mechanism The classical Ordered
Sequential mechanism prescribes a speciﬁc order of substrate-
binding events to form the central ternary complex for catalysis,
which is followed by a speciﬁc order of product-releasing events.
Note that because there are two substrates and two products,
there are four permutations of how the sequence order of bind-
ing/unbinding could proceed. One example of the sequence
order, when applied to the oxidoreductase reaction, consists of
the binding of reduced species of donor e-carrier D”, the bind-
ing of oxidized species of acceptor e-carrier A”, the catalytic
transfer of electron in the ternary complex, the release of oxi-
dized species of donor e-carrier D“ and ﬁnally the release of
reduced species of acceptor e-carrier AW (Fig. 5A). As in the
case of the Ping-Pong mechanism, the Ordered Sequential mech-
anism can be encoded by the minimum number of transitions, as
shown in Figure 5B. In contrast, however, all the electron trans-
fer steps operate in the trimolecular states. With the addition of
the boundary electron transfer reactions introduced in the frame-
work, the catalytic part of the reaction is expanded according to
a linear sequence of Equations ($7). To emulate the Theorelli
Chance mechanism, a special case of Ordered Sequential mech-
anism where the steady-state level of the trimolecular states are
very low, the unitary rate constants for the reactions leading to
the bimolecular complexes need to be set very large compared
with the unitary rate constants leading to the trimolecular com-
plex or the unimolecular enzyme (Leskovac, 2003).

3.2.3 Random Sequential mechanism In the classical Random
Sequential mechanism, the sequence order of the substrates bind-
ing and products unbinding is random, which effectively encom-
passes all four permutations of the Ordered Sequential
mechanism simultaneously. At any time, either one of the sub-
strates can bind ﬁrst, while either product can unbind ﬁrst from
the complex (Fig. 6A). Similar to the Ordered Sequential mech-
anism, the catalysis of the reaction is expanded according to a
linear sequence of Equations ($7), but its encoding is expanded
to 11 elementary reaction pairs to incorporate all sequence per-
mutations (Fig. 6B). RedoxMech has all three Bi Bi mechanisms
pre-encoded so that one only needs to specify the option (e.g.
ReactionType —> ‘Random’) in the EC 1 arrow notation shown in

Equation (13). A convenient function for inspecting the intra-
enzyme reaction network Visually is ReactionMatrix, which dis-
plays a matrix composed of a list of initial microstates as rows
and a list of ﬁnal microstates as columns such that each matrix
entry represents the transition rate between the microstates. An
example is shown for the Random mechanism of an EC 1 com-
plex in Table 3.

3.2.4 Comparing the eﬂects of speciﬁc mechanisms Besides the
steady-state parameters, the timeiseries output of a micro-model
is also directly affected by the speciﬁc mechanism encoded in its
intra-enzyme reaction network. Figure 7 shows how models of
the various Bi Bi mechanisms described earlier (Ping-Pong,
Ordered Sequential and Random Sequential) compare with the
complete model using the full intra-enzyme reaction network in
both their concentration time series of free D’Td (not bound to
the enzyme) and ﬂux time series of substrate e-carrier species
(D’Td and A“). All four models share the same steady-state par-
ameter values. The preisteady-state period of the concentration
time series shows both the time it takes for the reaction system to
reach steady-state saturation, as indicated by duration of the
initial drop (offset) in concentration due to the binding of the
reactant with the complex, and the total offset amount when
reaching steady state (Fig. 7A). The biggest difference is in the
offset of the free D’Td concentration of the complete model,
which doubles in magnitude (twice that of enzyme concentration)
compared with the other models. This is likely due to the com-
plete model using all bimolecular and trimolecular states, and the

extra states absorb more of free D’Pd in comparison with the
other submechanisms. The differences in the free concentration
offset across the four reactants can also reveal their relative pos-
ition in the order of the reaction. The corresponding preisteady-
state ﬂux comparison in Figure 7B shows that the ﬂux of the
Ping-Pong model is already decelerating, whereas others are still
maintaining a constant value. In addition, the difference in the
ﬂux of the substrate species is markedly smaller in the Ping-Pong
model. Both effects are likely to be caused by disruptions to the
electron transfer sequence by the binding reactions, which favor
the reverse transitions in the intra-enzyme reaction network.
From the complete time series in Figures 7C and D, it can
been seen that the bimolecular mechanism of the Ping-Pong
model produces a distinctively slower conversion of substrates
than the trimolecular mechanisms in the other models.
Predictably, the complete model is the fastest, followed by the
Random model, Ordered model and ﬁnally the Ping-Pong
model, in the order of decreasing number of possible electron
traveling paths.

3.3 Cascading EC 1 pathway or supercomplex

Some of the most prominent oxidoreductases are organized
physiologically inside membranes to perform cascades of elec-
tron transfer reactions (Mitchell, 1969; Nicholls and Ferguson,
2002). These EC 1 complexes can either rely on the intermediate
e-carriers that freely diffuse in the plane of the membrane to
chain the complexes together in a linear pathway, or alterna-
tively, the complexes can form aggregates or supercomplexes to
enable direct electron channeling (Boekema and Braun, 2007).
Through its modular approach, RedoxMech enables one to pro-
grammatically define and simulate cascading EC 1 reactions in
either a pathway or supercomplex setting, with the ability to
deﬁne the conditions in which the dynamics may switch (see
Supplementary Mathematica notebook).

4 CONCLUSION

We have introduced a general microscopic framework for the
kinetic modeling of Bi Bi oxidoreductases by decomposing
their redox capabilities into seven elementary reactions. By
using different combinations of enzyme state transitions, this
approach enables and subsumes more specialized models for spe-
ciﬁc members of the family, or specific conditions. Furthermore,
in the steady-state regime, the approach leads to macroscopic
rate equations consistent with previous derivations and with ex-
perimental data, unifying both microscopic and macroscopic
approaches for modeling enzymatic reaction of EC 1. Because
the microscopic models are composable, the generality of the
approach can also be used to model EC 1 supercomplexes as
cascades of individual complexes. In addition, the microscopic
framework allows incorporation of elementary binding reactions
of speciﬁc inhibitory reactants to enable modeling of regulatory
control mechanisms, as well as alternative electron transfer reac-
tions to enable modeling of slippage mechanisms involved in
reactive oxygen species production. Altogether, this framework
provides a way to ﬂexibly and programmatically describe the
core enzymes of cellular energetics for possible integration into
future comprehensive models of metabolism that will further our
understanding of the central role bioenergetics play, not only in
the maintenance of life but also in disease and aging.

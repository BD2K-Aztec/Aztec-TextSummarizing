Abstract

Summary: There are several experimental contexts in which it is important to identify DNA integra—
tion sites, such as insertional mutagenesis screens, gene and enhancer trap applications, and gene
therapy. We previously developed an assay to identify millions of integrations in multiplexed bar—
coded samples at base—pair resolution. The sheer amount of data produced by this approach
makes the mapping of individual sites non—trivial without bioinformatics support. This article pre—
sents the Genomic Integration Site Tracker (GeIST), a command—line pipeline designed to map the
integration sites produced by this assay and identify the samples from which they came. GeIST ver—
sion 2.1.0, a more adaptable version of our original pipeline, can identify integrations of murine leu—
kemia virus, adeno—associated virus, To|2 transposons or Ac/Ds transposons, and can be adapted
for other inserted elements. It has been tested on experimental data for each of these delivery vec—
tors and fine—tuned to account for sequencing and cloning artifacts.

Availability and implementation: GeIST uses a combination of Bash shell scripting and Perl. GeIST
is available at http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/software/GeISTl.

1 Introduction

The technique of identifying the sites at which foreign DNA inte—
grates into a genome has many uses in genomic research, with the
approach for identifying these sites taking numerous forms.
Insertional mutagenesis can be used as a powerful forward genetic
screen (Bard—Chapeau et (11., 2014; Golling et (11., 2002; Kleckner
et (11., 1977; Varshney et (11., 2013). Gene therapy vectors can be
tested to establish the expected level of insertional mutagenic activ—
ity (Li et (11., 2011). Gene and enhancer traps are important tools for
tagging and studying genomic elements (Clark et (11., 2011; O’Kane
and Gehring, 1987).

In each case, it is important to have a means of identifying the
integration sites, preferably at as high a resolution as possible. For
small—scale studies, this may be accomplished through inverse
PCR, or through linker—mediated PCR (LM—PCR), subcloning, and
Sanger sequencing (Devon et (11., 1995; Ochman et (11., 1988; Wu

et (11., 2003). At a larger scale, a high—throughput approach is pref—
erable. We developed a method capable of identifying millions of
integrations from a single run of high—throughput LM—PCR
sequencing (Varshney et (11., 2013). To maximize efficiency, the
method uses 6—bp DNA barcodes that can be used to multiplex
samples or discriminate between independent integration events
(LaFave et (11., 2014).

The large volume of data produced by this approach means
that an unassisted interpretation of the sequencing output is non—
trivial. Therefore, we have developed the Genomic Integration Site
Tracker (GeIST) to address this. GeIST accepts a RAM or FASTQ
file of paired—end LM—PCR sequences and a file indicating the asso—
ciation between samples and barcodes. The software returns a
RAM file of the sequences at each integration junction, a Browser
Extensible Data (BED) file for easy visualization of the integration
patterns, and a summary of how often each barcode was detected.

real experiments, such as misleading base quality scores and cloning
artifacts. GeIST version 2.1.0 explicitly indicates the group and indi—

vidual sample of each integration in the output, as defined by the
barcode file created by the user. This modification is well—suited to
applying the assay to many samples or to strains composed of mul—
tiple individuals, but is ﬂexible enough to work with a single sample.
Users can assign barcodes into groups, which affects whether inte—
grations at the same genomic position, but with different barcodes,
are considered to be independent. This allows the user to distinguish
between integrations that co—localize due to multiple independent
events versus those due to shared ancestry.

2.2 Workflow

GeIST is designed to run in a Unix environment and requires cuta—
dapt, Bowtie and SAMtools (Langmead et (11., 2009; Li et (11., 2009;
Martin 2011); if the input is in the BAM format, BamTools is also
required (Barnett et (11., 2011). It is designed to process paired—end
reads of LM—PCR amplicons (Fig. 1A). GeIST first identifies the
fragments that contain the sequence of the integrated element at the
start of a read, and the linker and barcode at the start of the other
(Fig. 1B). Cutadapt is used to trim non—genomic sequences and low—
quality bases, and a Perl script is used to track each fragment’s bar—
code. If the LM—PCR primer was upstream of the 3’ end of the inte—
grated element, the cutadapt step also removes spurious
amplifications. Trimmed sequences are aligned to a user—supplied
genome index via Bowtie.

Two alignments are performed: the first uses reads that span the
insert—genome junction (Fig. 1A, upper dashed arrow), and the
second uses the reads paired with those from the first alignment
(lower dashed arrow). The second set of reads is aligned without
trimming the low—quality bases. Our rationale for this ap—
proach comes from our use of experimental data in designing
GeIST. We observed that bases called as low quality were often still
accurate, in that they overlapped and were consistent with the high—
quality paired read. The reads containing the insert—genome junction
are therefore trimmed for quality, but the pairs of these reads
are not.

Reads that are not properly paired are removed. The remaining
fragments are filtered to remove false positives: integration sites
within 5 bp of and on the same strand as an integration site with a
higher integration count are discarded, provided both sites share the
same barcode group. GeIST produces a BAM file of the reads that
span the insert—genome junction, while the position and barcode
data is used to derive the other output files. In our experience, the

BED file is invaluable for visualizing integration patterns with tools
such as the UCSC browser (Kent et (11., 2002; Fig. 1C).

GeIST contains additional steps to accommodate the specifics of
certain integrated elements. For AAV data, GeIST makes use of an
extra Perl script and an adjusted trimming strategy to account for
the variable region of the inverted terminal repeat used for amplifi—
cation (Linden et (11., 1996). Similarly, an extra call to cutadapt is
used to filter out MLV reads that arise from internal amplification
of the provirus.

3 Conclusion

GeIST is an important and simple—to—use complement to our high—
throughput barcoded sequencing and mapping strategy. It bridges
the gap between raw sequence data and identifying genomic DNA
integration sites in multiple samples or parsing independent events
in a single sample. GeIST is also suited to identify multiple types of
integrations. In principle, it can be further modified to identify any
type of element that can be amplified via LM—PCR.

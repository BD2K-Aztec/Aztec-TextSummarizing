Abstract

Summary: miRZGO is a web—based platform for comparative analyses of human miRNA functions.
It includes two programs: miRmutZGO and miRpairZGO. miRmutZGO implements a knowledge—
based method to assess the functional effects of genetic and somatic mutations in microRNA seed
regions. The functional effects of a mutation are analysed by semantic comparison of enriched
gene ontology (GO) annotations of the target gene sets for the wild—type and mutated alleles.
miRpairZGO compares the functions of two different miRNAs based on the enriched functional

annotations of their target gene sets.

Availability and implementation: The miRZGO web server is available at http://compbio.uthsc.edu/

1 Introduction

MicroRNAs (miRNA) are important post—transcriptional regulators
of gene expression. It has been estimated that ~60% of protein
coding genes are potential targets of miRNA regulation (Friedman
et (11., 2009). The most important regulatory signal of a miRNA, the
information guiding its target recognition, is primarily encoded in
the seed region (nucleotides 2—7 in mature miRNA sequences).
Because a miRNA often have a large number of target genes, a
miRNA seed mutation, may affect the regulation of many genes
simultaneously. Thus, genetic and somatic mutations in miRNA
seeds may have broad impacts on target gene expression and have
been linked to various diseases (Bhattacharya et (11., 2013, 2014; Iliff
et (11., 2012; Mencia et (11., 2009).

MicroRNA functions can be predicted and annotated by linking
the target genes to diseases and gene ontology (GO) terms (Lagana
et (11., 2009; Nam et (11., 2008). However, such analyses are based
only on wild—type miRNAs and do not study the effects of miRNA
mutations. The functional effects of a miRNA seed mutation can be
assessed by comparative analysis of predicted target genes for
the wild—type and mutated alleles of the miRNA. Differences and simi—
larities in the enriched functional annotations of the reference (In this

paper, the set of target genes for the wild—type miRNA are called
‘reference targets’, the set of target genes for the mutated miRNA are
called ‘derived targets’, the genes in both sets are called ‘common
targets’.) and derived target genes reﬂect the overall functional
impacts of the mutation. Here, we developed the miR2GO web server
to provide a computational tool for the assessment of functional
impacts of genetic and somatic mutations in miRNA seed regions.
The ﬁrst program of this web server, miRmut2GO, allows users to
analyse the changes of target genes caused by miRNA seed mutations
and view the functional impacts of these changes in GO graphs.
The second function of the web server, miRpair2GO, allows users to
perform comparative functional analysis of different miRNAs.

2.1 miRmutZGO

miRmut2GO is a web—based program for evaluating the functional
effects of mutations in miRNA seeds. First, miRmut2GO predicts the

seed mutations. Users can choose from two frequently used miRNA
target prediction algorithms, TargetScan (Lewis et (11., 2005)
and miRanda (Enright et (11., 2003). Users can also combine the
prediction results from the two algorithms by selecting the union or
intersection options. Second, miRmut2GO identifies the enriched
functional annotations for the reference and derived target genes. The
enriched functional annotations are obtained by using gProfileR, an R
interface for the web—based GO tool gProfiler (Reimand et (11., 2011).
Third, a semantic similarity score (Wang et (11., 2007) for the two sets
of enriched functional annotations is calculated using GOSemSim
(Yu et (11., 2010), an R library for semantic comparison between two
groups of GO terms. The similarity score varies from 0 to 1, where 0
indicates no similarity and 1 indicates complete similarity. Fourth,
miRmut2GO prepares GO graphs to visualize the functional effects of
miRNA seed mutations. RamiGO (Schroder et (11., 2013), an
R/Bioconductor library for AmiGO GO visualization, and Graphviz
(Gansner and North, 2000) are used for preparing GO graphs.
Figure 1 shows the functional diagram for miRmut2GO. In the GO
graph, the enriched GO terms are highlighted. The color of a node is
determined by three numbers—the number of reference targets, the
number of derived targets and the number of common targets, which
are annotated to this GO term. These three numbers are used to deter—
mine the blue, green and red components of the node color. The node
size is determined by the total number of target genes annotated to this
GO term. Such GO graphs provide a global view of the functional
impacts of the miRNA seed mutation. A more detailed GO graph with
the nodes labeled by GO terms, number of genes and P—values for
functional enrichments is also available from miRmut2GO.

2.2 miRpairZGO

Different miRNAs perform different functions by binding to differ—
ent sets of target genes. Therefore, we can compare the functions of
two miRNAs by comparing the functional annotations of their
target genes. miRpair2GO is a tool for comparative functional
analysis of different miRNAs. The workﬂow is almost same as that
of miRpair2GO except that miRpair2GO takes pairs of different
miRNAs as input (Fig. 1).

3 Usage

Both miRmut2GO and miRpair2GO require selection of prediction
method, parameter setting for functional enrichment analysis and

selection of input data. Options are provided for users to select of
either TargetScan or miRanda or combining both methods for
miRNA target prediction. Parameter settings for GO enrichment
analyses include specification of a P—value threshold for functional
enrichment and selection of a hierarchical filtering level. The hier—
archical filtering is used for grouping the similar GO terms in the
hierarchy of GO graph. After setting parameters, users need to
specify miRNA IDs or upload miRNA sequence data. For
miRmut2GO users also need to specify the mutations in miRNA
seeds. miRmut2GO supports the search of multiple single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). Similarly, miRpair2GO supports multiple
miRNA pairs as input. After the query is submitted, miR2GO
will run the workﬂows described earlier. Upon finishing all the
calculations, the programs first give tabular results with functional
similarity scores. The lists of predicted target genes and enriched
functional annotations and GO figures can be displayed by clicking
the links in the table. A detailed description of the usage of
miRmut2GO and miRpair2GO can be found in the help page
of miR2GO (http://compbio.uthsc.edu/miR2GO/help.php).

4 Discussion

With the advance in genomic technologies, the number of newly iden—
tified genetic and somatic mutations in miRNA seeds has been
increasing very rapidly in recent years. There was virtually no known
miRNA seed SNPs when we created the PolymiRTS database (Bao
et (11., 2007) and only 20 SNPs were mapped to the human miRNA
seed regions when we developed PolymiRTS 2.0 (Ziebarth et (11.,
2012). The number of human miRNA seed SNPs increased to 271 in
PolymiRTS 3.0 (Bhattacharya et (11., 2014). Currently, 517 SNPs can
be mapped to the seed regions of 414 human miRNAs using the
genomic coordinates of SNPs in dbSNP (Sherry et (11., 2001) and
the miRNA data in miRBase (Kozomara and Griffiths—Jones, 2014).
Somatic mutations have also been found in miRNA seed regions
(Bhattacharya et (11., 2013; Silva et (11., 2013). There is a great need to
analyse the functional impacts of the miRNA seed mutations.
miR2GO provides a web—based tool to address this challenge.
It integrates miRNA target prediction, GO enrichment analysis and
semantic comparison of functional annotations to analyse the
functional impacts of mutations in miRNA seed regions. It also uses
the same workﬂow to compare the functions of different miRNAs.
It is noteworthy that miR2GO can also be used to predict the
functional impacts of any hypothetical seed mutations or compare
the functions of designed miRNA sequence with existing miRNAs,
which might be useful in artificial miRNA design (Tay et (11., 2015).

miR2GO relies on miRNA target prediction tools to generate
target gene sets. The default miRNA target prediction tool of
miR2GO is TargetScan. In a recent comprehensive assessments of
miRNA target prediction methods (Fan and Kurgan, 2015),
TargetScan was one of the best predictors with an AUC (area under
the ROC curve) of 0.748 at the gene level. Although this is a reason—
ably good predictive performance, obviously miR2GO can benefit
from more accurate miRNA target prediction. Because miR2GO
uses a modular framework, better target prediction tools can be eas—
ily incorporated when they become available.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The S/TQ cluster domain (SCD) constitutes a new type of
protein domain that is not defined by sequence similarity but by the
presence of multiple S/TQ motifs within a variable stretch of amino
acids. SCDs are recognized targets for DNA damage response (DDR)
kinases like ATM and ATR. Characterizing DDR targets is of significant
interest. The aim of this work was to develop a web-based tool to
allow for easy identification and visualization of SCDs within speciﬁc
proteins or in whole proteome sets, a feature not supported by current
domain and motif search tools.

Results: We have developed an algorithm that (i) generates a list of all
proteins in an organism containing at least one user-defined SCD
within their sequence, or (ii) identifies and renders a visual represen-
tation of all user-defined SCDs present in a single sequence or batch
of sequences.

Availability and implementation: The application was developed
using Pearl and Python, and is available at the following URL: http://
ustbioinfo.webfactional.com/scd/.

1 INTRODUCTION

ATM and ATR are the chief controlling kinases of a cell’s re-
sponse to DNA damage (Ciccia and Elledge, 2010; Shiloh and
Zhiv, 2013). The complete set of ATM and ATR (ATM/ATR)
targets is currently unknown, but several high-throughput stu-
dies suggest that the ﬁnal tally could be well over a thousand
proteins (Matsuoka et al., 2007). Furthermore, there is growing
evidence for ATM functions even in the absence of DNA
damage, although direct ATM/ATR targets in those pathways
are currently mostly uncharacterized (Shiloh and Zhiv, 2013).
Both ATM and ATR preferentially phosphorylate substrates
on serine or threonine residues that are followed by a glutamine
(S/TQ). Their speciﬁcity for this motif is such that mutations on
the glutamine can be as deleterious for function as mutating the
serine or the threonine (Kim et al., 1999). In addition, several
well-known ATM/ATR targets contain clusters of more than
one S/TQ motif within a small region of the protein. This

observation led to the description of the SCD, a new type of
domain that is not defined by a rigidly conserved sequence simi-
larity but rather by the presence of at least three S/TQ motifs
within a stretch of 100 amino acids (Traven and Heierhorst,
2005). This domain is present in 43 of 81 of the better-character-
ized ATM targets in mammalian cells, and it can also be found in
more than half of 686 human proteins identiﬁed in a high-
throughput analysis as containing phosphorylated S/TQ motifs
(Matsuoka et al., 2007). Studies using a more stringent SCD
deﬁnition (three S/TQ in 50 amino acids) found this domain
present four times more abundantly in the yeast proteome than
expected by random generation and concentrated in proteins
belonging to pathways known to be under ATM/ATR control
(Cheung et al., 2012).

Searching for proteins that may contain an SCD is not a
simple task, given the domain’s arbitrary length and structural
diversity that has been observed to date. Current tools for motif
or domain identiﬁcation (like SMART, which is designed to
search for signaling domain sequences) typically rely on con-
served sequence similarity and are thus not best suited for search-
ing for SCD domains. Even ELM, which identiﬁes functional
motifs in eukaryotic proteins and has a Phosphoblast tool that
identiﬁes phosphorylated serines, threonines and tyrosines, does
not identify SCDs. Similarly, most motif-ﬁnding tools do not
support the search for multiple motifs in regions of limited
length. While it is possible to use the ScanProsite tool with a
user-deﬁned pattern, the SCD is not part of the default ProSite
collection of motifs. A user can submit a customized search pat-
tern, but whole genome analysis is not possible without integrat-
ing to an external bioinformatics pipeline to perform the
necessary ﬁltering of the initial results, which requires program-
ming abilities by the user. To facilitate this process, we have
created SCDFinder, a web-based tool that allows a user to
easily search for SCD-containing proteins in different proteomes
using a user-determined SCD deﬁnition. This program can also
be used to identify and Visualize user-deﬁned SCD domains
within a given sequence or in a batch of submitted sequences.

2 METHODS

SCDFinder is implemented mainly in the Python programming language.
It uses Prosite’s ps_scan Pearl script (available from: ftp://ftp.expasy.org/
databases/prosite/ps_scan/) to search for proteins containing a S/TQ

cluster domain (SCD; Sigrist et al., 2002). SCDFinder then performs three
levels of ﬁltering on the results returned. The ﬁrst level of ﬁltering is
necessary to ensure that the SCD found by the ps_scan script matches
the desired SCD length definition. For example, if we deﬁne an SCD as
consisting of three S/TQs in 100 residues, then the query SCDFinder
passes to ps_scan is [ST]Q-X[100]-[ST]Q-X[100]-[ST]Q, where [100] is
the number of residues between the S/TQ, even though this will return
results that have SCDs longer than our desired 100 residues (e.g. TQ-
[74AA]-SQ-[90AA]-SQ). Results that do not match the deﬁnition will
subsequently be removed in this ﬁrst ﬁltering stage. The second ﬁltering
is optional and counts a protein with multiple SCDs as a single hit. The
ﬁnal level of ﬁltering is also optional and accomplishes two things: it
restricts the results to a single hit for those proteins that have isoforms
and ﬁlters out proteins that have the same descriptions but different
RefSeq IDs. Finally, using jQuery and Python, SCDFinder creates visu-
alizations highlighting the location of the SCDs in the analyzed proteins.

3 RESULTS

SCDFinder is an online, open-access tool that can be accessed at
http://ustbioinfo.webfactional.com/scd/. This SCD search tool is
easy to use and offers two distinct interfaces that allow user-
defined queries: a static database search and a custom FASTA
sequence search. Both allow the user to customize the SCD def-
inition, or use the default deﬁnition of three S/TQs in 100
residues.

3.1 Static database search

In the static database search, users can identify all SCD-contain-
ing proteins in a given proteome of interest. The user chooses the
desired organism from a dropdown menu (the current list con-
tains 17 completed eukaryotic proteomes retrieved from NCBI in
January 2013). The user also stipulates the SCD deﬁnition by
manipulating the number of S/TQ motifs allowed in a speciﬁed
stretch of amino acids (the default is three S/TQs in 100 amino
acids). Multiple deﬁnitions can be assigned to each search, and
the hits are returned as a hyperlinked list of proteins separated by
SCD deﬁnition. The summary box, showing a tally of all hits,
links to result lists that include the NCBI RefSeq accession
number and function for each protein retrieved. Choking on
each hit generates a ﬂat ﬁle of the FASTA protein sequence
with each S/TQ motif highlighted in red and the SCD highlighted
in green (see Fig. 1). Each result list also has an advanced results
tab, which shows itemized lists of proteins containing multiple
SCDs found per protein type, as well as a list, which also includes
SCD-containing isoforms. All run ﬁles are downloadable in a
CSV format.

3.2 Custom F ASTA sequence search

The custom FASTA sequence search allows the user to directly
paste sequences of interest into a search window, or to upload a
ﬁle containing multiple sequences for analysis. Users can also
define the SCD based on their preferred cutoff for number of
S/TQs and length of SCD. This search option also has an
advanced results tab that links to graphical representations of
multiple SCD occurrences per protein (highlighted as described
above) and a link showing SCDs found in isoforms of each

4 DISCUSSION

SCDFinder is a new Web-based tool for the detection and Visu-
alization of user-deﬁned SCDs within single proteins, a set of
proteins, or entire proteomes. It can be used to identify putative
novel ATM /ATR substrates or to reveal new pathways under the
possible control of these kinases. This tool may be particularly
useful to investigate the function of ATM/ATR in the absence of
DNA damage by identifying potential direct targets that may
have been missed in studies that fail to reproduce the conditions
under which these kinases are activated. Other valuable applica-
tions may include its use in comparative proteomics studies or to
determine the optimal SCD definition for different organisms.

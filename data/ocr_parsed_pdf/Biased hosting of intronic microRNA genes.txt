ABSTRACT

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in an abundant
class of post-transcriptional regulation activated through binding to
the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs. The current wealth of
mammalian miRNA genes results mostly from genomic duplication
events. Many of these events are located within introns of
transcriptional units. In order to better understand the genomic
expansion of miRNA genes, we investigated the distribution of
intronic miRNAs.

Results: We observe that miRNA genes are hosted within introns of
short genes much larger than expected by chance.
Implementation: We explore several explanations for this
phenomenon and conclude that miRNA integration into short
genes might be evolutionary favorable due to interaction with the
pre-mRNA splicing mechanism.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short ~22 nt RNAs that bind to
complementary sequences in the mRNA’s 3’-untranslated region
(UTR) in order to regulate gene expression through translational
silencing, mRNA degradation or cleavage (Ambros, 2004; Bartel,
2004; Filipowicz et (11., 2005; Plasterk, 2006). miRNA regulation
is an abundant mode of post-transcriptional regulation as each
miRNA targets a multitude of mRNAs (Friedman et (11., 2009;
Lewis et (11., 2005; Nielsen et (11., 2007). miRNAs were found to be
involved in many cellular processes such as growth, differentiation
and cell death (Bushati and Cohen, 2007). The current wealth of
miRNA genes results mostly from genomic episodes dominated by
large duplication events (Hertel et (11., 2006) in addition to local
expansions (e.g. see Bentwich et (11., 2005; Shomron et (11., 2009).
These events can be located in either intergenic or intronic regions,
namely, within introns of transcriptional units (Kim and Kim, 2007;
Rodriguez et (11., 2004; Shomron and Levy, 2009; Weber, 2005). In
order to better understand the genomic expansion of miRNA genes,
we investigated the genome-wide distribution of intronic miRNAs.
We observe, like others, that miRNA genes are on average more
frequently hosted in introns of long genes, though we also notice

that their presence within introns of short genes is much larger
than expected by chance. We discuss several explanations for this
phenomenon and link this observation to differential pre-mRNA
splicing of short versus long introns.

2 METHODS
2.1 Simulating miRNA distribution

Given an miRNA density value, we simulated ~26 K genes of the same sizes
as the set of human genes and randomly allocated miRNAs to those genes
according to the given density. This enables us to estimate shape, mean and
variance of various statistics such as the average size of an miRNA hosting
gene, and the distribution of miRNA hosting genes” population.

We used this data to reject the hypothesis that the average length of miRNA
hosting genes is drawn from the expected distribution given the random
insertion model. Moreover, using Kolmogorvismirnov test, we rejected the
hypothesis that the lengths of miRNA host genes are sampled from the
expected distribution given the random insertion model.

We used regression analysis to show a negative correlation between the
miRNA density of a gene and the gene’s length (the number of hosted
miRNAs divided by the gene’s length).

For host-intron length conservation, we used Bartlett’s statistical test in
order to see whether two sets of samples have the same variance. This test
is robust to departures from the normality assumption.

2.2 Splicing knockdown and mRNA/miRNA proﬁling

HeLa cells were transfected using HiPerFect according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with 100 pmol siRNA oligos (against
Prp8 and U2AF65 or scrambled control; Ambion, TX, USA) per well
(0.5 X 106 cells). RNA was extracted 20 h later for high-throughput real-time
PCR analysis on ABI miRNA TLDA arrays or using Affymetrix GeneChip
Arrays 2.0 (also see Nielsen at (11., 2007). Splicing factors were reduced;
yet the level of splicing was not drastically affected at this short time point
observed by comparing the levels of all miRNA host gene transcripts. Each
experiment was repeated four times. For northern blot analysis, 10 u g of total
RNA were resolved in a 12% ureaipolyacrylamide gel (BioRad, CA, USA)
and transferred onto membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham, NJ, USA). Marker
and RNA probes directed against mature let-7c, let-7g and tRNA (IDT,
IA, USA) were radiolabeled (mirVana, Ambion) with 32F. Prehybridization
and hybridization were carried out for 1 and 12 h, respectively, at 42°C
(ULTRAhyb-Oligo; Ambion). The membrane was washed for 15 min at 42°C
in 2 ><SSC and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, exposed and scanned using a
Storm Phosphorlmaging system (Molecular Dynamics, NJ, USA).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Intronic miRNAs are not randomly distributed
within genes

In order to address genomic distribution of miRNAs within introns,
we ﬁrst remapped the genomic positions of these miRNA genes,

obtained from the Refseq database. We identiﬁed 167 miRNAs
located in introns (based on Refseq gene annotation), which
represents 31.5% of the human miRNA repertoire, similar to
previous observations (Kim and Kim, 2007; Rodriguez et (11., 2004;
Weber, 2005). We note that in our study we do not segregate between
protein coding and non-coding genes and we take into consideration
only miRNAs within introns (ignoring other cases where, e.g., an
miRNA overlaps with an exon; 1.8% in our dataset). We also ignore
miRNAs which do not reside on the same strand as the hosting gene.

miRNAs mostly evolve through genomic duplication events
(Heimberg et (11., 2008; Hertel et (11., 2006) in addition to some
local rapid expansions (e.g. see Bentwich et (11., 2005). In order to
identify the pattern of integration, we deﬁned our null hypothesis
to be an evenly distributed set of miRNA genes scattered among
all known genes. In other words, the miRNA genomic density (the
number of miRNAs divided by number of bases in a gene) should
be constant. Similarly, longer genes would be prone to host more
miRNA genes.

The null hypothesis would be true in the event that the mode
of miRNA distribution follows a random genomic integration. For
control purposes, we simulated a random miRNA integration event
where the known intronic miRNAs were stochastically distributed
within known genes. We then set to analyze the bonaﬁde data. If the
null hypothesis is true, we expect that larger genes will have more
miRNAs in them in direct proportion to their length since longer
genes have a higher chance of being ‘hit’ by an integrating miRNA.
Indeed, as expected, we ﬁnd that the average length of miRNA-
hosting genes is almost three times larger than those of non-hosting
genes: 160 kb versus 59 kb (using Refseq gene set).

Interestingly, however, when calculating miRNA densities
(miRNAs per gene length) we observe higher densities of miRNAs
in short genes with an average length of integration being almost
half that of the expected (compare 160kb to ~300kb; P-value
<0.0004). This observation was cross-validated by running a linear
regression model which showed that the length is negatively
correlated with density (P-value <0.015). We note that there is
a direct and strong correlation between short introns and short
genes. Therefore, everywhere we refer to ‘short introns’ this could
be interchangeable with ‘short genes’. Moreover, miRNA hosting
introns’ sizes in short genes do not differ signiﬁcantly from their
non-hosts counterparts.

Figure 1 shows the percentage of miRNA containing genes as
a function of progressive length, where the difference between
the expected and observed lengths is signiﬁcant (Kolmogorov—
Smimov P-value <0.001). The continuous effect observed not only
emphasizes the generality of this phenomenon but also suggests
that it does not depend on particular odd events. These results
do not agree with a previous study (see Zhou and Lin, 2008
and Supplementary Material for further discussion). The difference
remains signiﬁcant even when miRNAs residing on a different
strand than the hosting gene are included (data not shown; this
eliminates the transcriptional dependence between the miRNA—
mRNA expression).

We conclude that the presence of miRNA genes within introns of
short genes is much larger than expected by chance. This apparently
has a functional importance as comparative study of mice, ﬂy and
worm miRNAs gave very similar results (Fig. 1 and data not shown).
Finally, we conclude that miRNA integration into introns of host
genes is a non-random event.

signiﬁcant difference using a Kolmogorovismirnov test (P < 0.001). Insets

P-Value. The mouse plot excludes one gene (NM_177386) which hosts 27
miRNAs since it is an outlier. However, results remain signiﬁcant when
including this gene, too.

3.2 Hosting genes’ characteristics

To test if transcript expression might be associated with miRNA
integration, we divided the set of intronic miRNAs into two groups:
(i) those that are expressed from the same strand as the hosting
gene and (ii) those that reside on the opposite strand. The P-value
of signiﬁcance suggests that miRNA integration into the opposite
strand of DNA is much closer to random (P = 0.08) compared with
the same strand (P =0.0004). The average length of genes at the
same orientation of their embedded miRNAs is 177 kb (11: 167)
while for the opposing-orientation genes the average length is larger
than 209 kb (n=28). Thus, there might be a signiﬁcant role of
transcript expression in miRNA integration and/or maintenance,
though we note that these results could be limited by the number of
events (low number of miRNAs create a signiﬁcantly larger standard
deviation; see Supplementary Material).

Several alternative explanations were also evaluated, including
a gene class preference of miRNA hosting genes. For example,
house-keeping genes may provide a good candidate set because they
are highly active in expression (Butte et (11. 2001; Castillo-Davis
et (11. 2002). However, our set of 167 genes did not signiﬁcantly
fall under this annotation category (using GOminer and DAVID;
data not shown). Neither did our gene set overlap with hundreds of
widely and highly expressed genes (Eisenberg and Levanon, 2003;
data not shown).

Chromatin structure plays a role in the accessibility of the
genomic DNA for integration events (Quina et (11., 2006). We
asked whether an open chromatin structure facilitates integration
of miRNAs into these regions. For this purpose, we looked at up-
and downstream genomic regions just adjacent to miRNA hosting
genes. We reasoned that if miRNAs integrate into introns due to
high genomic accessibility we will ﬁnd enrichment of miRNAs in
their vicinity, as well. However, there are no miRNAs adjacent to
the hosting genes (<10 kb), suggesting that chromatin structure does
not participate in the miRNA integration event. In fact, none of the
miRNAs was found adjacent (<10kb) to any house-keeping gene
(also see Stark et (11., 2005).

Even though miRNA genes originate primarily from duplication
events, other mechanisms, such as integration of repetitive genetic

elements (Piriyapongsa et (11., 2007) and local duplication and
mutation, may lead to miRNA ‘birth’ (Bentwich et (11., 2005;
Zhang et (11., 2007). To exclude the possibility that miRNAs have
evolved, de novo, in the introns of short genes, we looked into
the conservation and family members of intronic miRNAs. We
observe that miRNA genes of a common origin, those belonging
to the same miRNA family and are known to evolve by duplication
events, are prevalent in the intronic miRNA group (e.g. see intronic
miR-9,15,23,26,99,103,107,218; Hertel et (11., 2006; Weber, 2005).
Overall, >30% of the intronic miRNA genes are part of a miRNA
family suggesting that most were not generated de novo in short
introns as a consequence of accumulating mutations.

During pre-mRNA splicing, introns are removed and exons are
joined in a multistep multicomponent reaction (see Kim et (11., 2008;
Wang and Burge, 2008). It was suggested that introns of different
lengths are spliced differently (Berget, 1995) and recognition of
short introns might involve additional factors that facilitate intron—
exon identiﬁcation (Lim and Burge, 2001). We asked whether short
introns are a favorable environment for miRNAs due to interaction
with the pre-mRNA splicing reaction. For this purpose, we inhibited
splicing by knocking down key splicing factors (see Fig. 2A and
Section 2). We reasoned that if the splicing reaction plays a role
in miRNA maturation, short genes will behave differently from
long ones. We measured the levels of all miRNAs in the splicing
inhibited cells, discarded the ones that were not expressed, divided
the remaining miRNAs into two groups according to their length
and then performed statistics (Kolmogorov—Smirnov test) on the
two groups. Our results indicate that the short genes containing
miRNAs group are signiﬁcantly upregulated compared with the
cohort of the long genes (P = 0.002). Our results were normalized to
the expression level of all host genes and take into account that most
of the removed miRNAs are those that have no known relevance
in HeLa cells (our experimental system) and thus no detectable
expression in these cells. We note here that our analysis throughout
this study was carried out on mature miRNA forms. We do not
think that the observed miRNA increase is due to intron retention in
short genes, since we controlled for transcript levels after splicing
knockout. In the event of intron retention, we would have expected
many of the transcripts to be degraded leaving less rather than
more miRNAs. Having said that, we cannot exclude retention of the
miRNA-containing transcript in the nucleus leading to increased
miRNA levels. Other tests, such as measuring the proportion of
intron lengths out of the total length of the gene were not different
from the average Refseq gene (see Supplementary Material). Also,
tissue-speciﬁc expression did not reveal a certain miRNA gene
pattern associated with short host genes.

For additional conﬁrmation, we chose two miRNAs residing on
either a long or short gene and tested their change in expression
following splicing knockdown (Fig. 2A). Only miRNA let-7g,
hosted in a short gene (NM_025222; ~24 kb), but not let-7c, hosted
in a long gene (NM_001005734; ~413kb), exhibited an increase
in expression in the presence of reduced splicing factors (Fig. 2B).
The question raised here is in what manner does the integration
of an miRNA into a short intron becomes favorable? If miRNAs
in short introns are associated with lower or hindered expression,
then one possibility might be integration into these introns in
order to exert a mild regulation of potentially many target genes.
Overtime, after target genes either gain or loose binding sites for the
lowly expressed miRNA a stronger expression can evolve molding

directed against two central splicing factors, U2AF65 and PRPS, which led
to ~70% reduction in both gene levels. A scrambled siRNA was used as
control. The gene level was normalized to control transfections and to beta-
actin (n = 3). (B) Northern blotting of a let-7c and let-7g, which are harbored,

normalizing to tRNA levels. The TINA software was used to measure band
intensity (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).

an increased regulatory effect that can accommodate high rather
than low miRNA expression (see Fig. 3; also see Shomron et (11.,
2009). Moreover, given this hypothesis one would expect to see
higher conservation of the length of the miRNA hosting introns.
To test this, we looked at a subset of miRNAs that are hosted in
introns in both human and mouse. The estimated mean relative
change in both groups was insigniﬁcantly different between the
groups and insigniﬁcantly different from zero (using two-sample
and one sample t-tests, accordingly). However, the variance of the
changes in the host group was 250 times smaller than in the non-
hosts group (the variance was signiﬁcantly smaller with P-value
<0.0001 using Bartlett’s test, see Supplementary Material for more
details). We conclude that the sizes of miRNA hosting introns are
indeed more conserved, as miRNA hosting introns experience a less
drastic change in size. The conservation of intron length has several
evolutionary implications. For example, these introns are less likely
to receive transposable elements due to detrimental effect on miRNA
expression.

Intronic miRNA genes

 

From this, we conclude that a possible mechanism assisting
miRNA integration and/or maintenance into short genes is
their interconnection with the pre-mRNA splicing mechanism.
Along these lines, we have recently observed that intronic miRNAs
may be hindered by ﬂanking spliced exons (C. Levy et (11.,
unpublished data). We extend this observation here and show that
this interference is possibly more apparent in short genes.

Overall, our results suggest that miRNAs are enriched for in
shorter genes; that their integration into short genes might be due
to transcript expression levels but not due to genomic accessibility;
and that miRNA integration into short genes might be evolutionary
favorable due to interaction with pre-mRNA splicing.

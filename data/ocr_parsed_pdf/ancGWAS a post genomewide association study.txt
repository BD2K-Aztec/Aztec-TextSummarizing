Abstract

Motivation: Despite numerous successful Genome—wide Association Studies (GWAS), detecting
variants that have low disease risk still poses a challenge. GWAS may miss disease genes with
weak genetic effects or strong epistatic effects due to the single—marker testing approach com—
monly used. GWAS may thus generate false negative or inconclusive results, suggesting the need
for novel methods to combine effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms within a gene to in—
crease the likelihood of fully characterizing the susceptibility gene.

Results: We developed ancGWAS, an algebraic graph—based centrality measure that accounts for
linkage disequilibrium in identifying significant disease sub—networks by integrating the associ—
ation signal from GWAS data sets into the human protein—protein interaction (PPI) network. We
validated ancGWAS using an association study result from a breast cancer data set and the simula—
tion of interactive disease loci in the simulation of a complex admixed population, as well as path—
way—based GWAS simulation. This new approach holds promise for deconvoluting the interactions
between genes underlying the pathogenesis of complex diseases. Results obtained yield a novel
central breast cancer sub—network of the human interactome implicated in the proteoglycan synde—
can—mediated signaling events pathway which is known to play a major role in mesenchymal
tumor cell proliferation, thus providing further insights into breast cancer pathogenesis.

genetic risk (Zhang et al., 2014). Because the effect of a gene poly—
morphism may be small, GWAS may fail to detect a significant sig—
nal if the effect of a variant in another gene is not taken into account
(Cantor et al., 2010). Since complex diseases are typically caused by
multiple factors, including multiple genes, through gene—gene inter—
actions (Jia et al., 2010), single—marker—based analysis in GWAS
may generate false negative and inconclusive results (Jia et al., 2010;
Peng et al., 2008). Currently the challenges facing GWAS include:
(i) the translation of associated loci into suitable biological hypothe—
ses, (ii) the well—known problem of missing heritability (Cantor
et al., 2010; Chimusa et al., 2012) and (iii) the understanding of
how multiple modestly associated loci within genes interact to inﬂu—
ence a phenotype (Peng et al., 2008).

Detecting the underlying genetic etiology of the disease can be
difficult, as it may involve a single gene or interactions between two
or more genes. Recent studies have demonstrated that there is a re—
lationship between gene function and phenotype, and that function—
ally related genes are more likely to interact (Wang et al., 2015a).
Alternatively, the effect can be at the phenotypic level, where a pair
of genes can interact to produce a specific phenotype (Zhang et al.,
2014). Interactions can play critical roles in the cause of disease,
therefore standard GWAS analysis alone is insufficient to examine
the complex genetic structure of complex diseases (Zhang et al.,
2014). The challenge of gene—gene interaction methods is that the
large number of multi—locus genotype combinations generated from
large numbers of genetic variants may leads to the so—called ‘curse
of dimensionality’ problem (Bellman, 1961). Recently, gene—set
based methods have been used to examine gene sets, particularly in
the form of biological pathways or grouping genes by cellular func—
tions or functional groups, using GWAS datasets (O’Dushlaine
et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010). These methods search for signifi—
cantly enriched gene sets collected from predefined canonical path—
ways or functional annotations such as Gene Ontology (GO) terms.
However, these approaches have limitations, such as (i) the require—
ment for strong disease—specific background knowledge, (ii) the in—
complete annotation of pathways or G0 annotations in the current
knowledgebase (Jia et al., 2010) and (iii) the results might be lim—
ited to a priori knowledge, thus, making it difficult to identify a
meaningful combination of genes (Peng et al., 2008). Because risk
genes may differ in different individuals, but may still lie in the
same pathway (Cantor et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015a), the
protein—protein interaction (PPI) network based approach was re—
cently introduced. This approach has been shown to largely over—
come some of the limitations in its ﬂexibility in setting the
components of a gene set (Cantor et al., 2010; Jia et al., 2010; Peng
et al., 2008). Examining the combined effects of genes by detecting
genetic signals beyond single gene polymorphisms may increase our
ability to fully characterize the susceptible genes and unravel the
pathogenesis of disease (Liu et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015a). These
existing network—based approaches are mostly based on combining
p—values from standard GWAS for correlated SNPs into an overall
significance level for a gene, and combining P—values for the genes
in a pathway into an overall significance level to investigate the as—
sociation of a pathway with the disease (Zhang et al., 2014).
However, in many cases, SNPs within genes and genes within path—
ways are correlated, and these methods do not account for this de—
pendency, but rather assume genes or SNPs to be independent and
uniformly distributed under a null hypothesis, which may lead to
erroneous results. In addition, most of these network—based
approaches do not account for topological properties of biological
networks, which may lead to meaningless sub—networks (Mazandu
and Mulder, 2011).

Here, we present a method, ancGWAS that leverages PPI net—
work information, local ancestry (in the case of admixed popula—
tions) and Linkage Disequilibrium data to mine GWAS results.
ancGWAS introduces ﬂexibility in estimating gene— and sub—
network—specific ancestry using the inferred local ancestry from
ancestry inference approaches such as in (Baran et al., 2012). From
different simulation results, we demonstrate that ancGWAS holds
promise for comprehensively examining the interactions between
genes underlying the pathogenesis of genetic diseases and also
underlying ethnic differences. In addition, we applied ancGWAS to
a GWAS data set from postmenopausal women of European ances—
try with invasive breast cancer (Hunter et al., 2007). Our result
yielded an interesting central breast cancer sub—network of
the human interactome implicated in the proteoglycan syndecan-
mediated signaling events pathway.

2 Materials and methods

We present an algebraic graph—based method (ancGWAS) that lever—
ages the topological analysis of the PPI network to (i) identify hub
genes, and use their topological properties, (ii) identify the most
meaningful and significant sub—networks, (iii) account for the correl—
ation that exists between SNPs within or between genes and genes
within pathways and (iv) estimate gene— and sub—network—specific
ancestry. Figure 1 summarizes the work—ﬂow of the ancGWAS ap—
proach and more details are provided in the following sections.

2.1 Assignment of ancestry, P—values and LD from

SNPs to genes

SNPs, their associated local ancestry, ancestral population minor al—
lele frequencies and GWAS P—values are assigned to a given gene if
they are located within the gene’s downstream or upstream region.
The dependency between genes is complex and is due to many

factors (Liang and Wen—Hsiung, 2007) between closely located
SNPs. LD can be observed due to functional interactions where even
genes from different chromosomes can jointly confer an evolution—
ary selected phenotype or can affect the viability of potential off—
spring. To capture such information and to exploit the topological
structure of PPI network for identifying informative sub—networks,
we weight the PPI network with LD estimated from genotype data
of the population under study. This is accomplished by computing
an overall LD from pairwise LD between SNPs at each given pair of
interacting genes. In this manner, the PPI network is weighted with
a correlation estimated from the population genotype data. This
should efficiently break down the PPI network into different sub—
networks (see the section below) and help in combining p—value
approaches that account for dependency of neighbouring genomic
markers within/between genes.

Assuming sets of SNPs S“ : {si},-:172Wm and SI7 : {eh-ﬁlm”,
s,- #5,, for i: 1,2,...,m, and for ['2 1,2,...,n are assigned to
genes a and b; the pairwise LD of SNPs between a and b are inde—
pendent and are computed using the 1’2 measure (Kristin et al., 2002)
from non—admixed population genotype data. In the case of an
admixed population, the admixture LD is computed following the
model in (Pickrell et al., 2012). The distribution of the LD is not
normal, thus from (5,- 9E s,-) we compute the average z—transforms of
LD from all possible combinations of pairs of SNPs between genes a
and b. The z—transforms of LD are normally distributed with mean 0
and variance 1 (Choi, 1977). We compute the combined LD be—
tween two genes a and b as follows,

n*m

Z tanh—1(LDSiSi)
rd), : tanh T]
n >l< m

The combined LD is used as the weight of the edge between a and b
genes in the PPI network. The computation of Eq. (1) may generate
values close to zero (but not exactly zero) for unlinked SNPs, par—
ticular for the genotype data of non—admixed populations, where
SNPs at genes across chromosomes or even on the same chromo—
some are not at all linked. After weighting the gene (node) with sum—
mary statistics from GWAS results and local ancestry; and the edges
of PPIs with LD data, the next section introduces the method for
breaking and clustering the network into different sub—networks.

2.2 Searching for sub—networks using

centrality measures

Genes interact in large networks in all living organisms, and some
genes in the network are more important or central than others (Liang
and Wen—Hsiung, 2007). Highly connected genes in PPI networks can
be functionally important and the removal of such nodes is related to
lethality (Liang and Wen—Hsiung, 2007). Here we introduce four cen—
trality measures (see more details in Supplementary Text S1) to ac—
count for the topological analysis of the PPI network. We consider our
edges— and nodes—weighted PPI network as an undirected network,
G : (V, E), where V is the set of n genes as nodes and E is the set
of edges as interactions found between genes weighted using gene—
correlation. To break down the graph G into sub—networks, we ana—
lyse the general properties of G and quantify the usefulness of each
gene in G using their centrality scores; closeness, betvveenness, degree
or eigenvector. These different centrality measures and the procedure
for identifying central genes and associated sub—networks based on
these centrality scores are described in the supplementary Text S1.

2.3 Statistical methods for combining P—values at the
gene and sub—network level

Here we discuss our approach to rule out the statistical significance
from SNPs within a given gene/sub—network. Combined P—value
approaches are commonly utilized for meta—analysis (Han and
Eskin, 2011) and neighbouring genomic markers in genetic associ—
ation studies, and have a long history (Folks, 1984). Under the null
hypothesis, the P—values P,, (i : 1,. . . ,L) for a test—statistic with a
continuous null distribution are uniformly distributed in the interval
[0, 1]. In this framework, a parametric cumulative distribution func—
tion F is chosen and the P—values are transformed into quantiles ac—
cording to q,- : F‘1(p,-), (i: 1,. . . ,L). The combined test statistic
CP : Zi:1qi is a sum of independent and identically distributed
random variables q,- each of which follows the corresponding prob—
ability density function for F. To account for the independent as—
sumption of P—values and the correlation of P—values among
neighboring genomic markers, we implement both the Stouffer—
Liptak (Liptak, 1958) and Fisher’s Combined probability (Fisher,
1958) methods (refer to Supplementary Text S2) accounting for spa—
tial correlations among SNPs within a gene or SNPs within a given
sub—network. We apply a similar algorithm to the Benjamini—
Hochberg (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) false—discovery correc—
tion method (Supplementary Text S2) on summary statistics from
both Stouffer—Liptak and Fisher’s Combined probability methods to
control the inﬂuence of possible type I error and account for gene/
sub—network difference the number of associated SNPs.

2.4 Method for combining local ancestry at gene

and sub—network level

Case—control admixture mapping has recently been advertised as a
promising strategy for identifying regions that contribute to both
shared and population—specific difference in disease susceptibility.
Admixture mapping has been applied to some admixed populations
such as Puerto Rican and Mexican populations (Torgerson et al.,
2012). However, similarly to standard GWAS, both approaches are
based on single—marker—based analysis. Because complex diseases
are caused by several factors, such as multiple genes through gene—
gene interactions and gene—environment interactions (Zhang et al.,
2014), both approaches mentioned above may generate false nega—
tive results. To take advantage of the combined effects of all SNPs in
a particular gene and genes within a sub—network, here we combine
the effect of locus—specific ancestry of SNPs within a gene/sub—net—
work in estimating sub—network— or gene—specific ancestry (see
Supplementary Text S3 for more details). The unknown true gene—
specific ancestry at gene / from the lath ancestral population, uik, is
estimated using the maximum likelihood approach, and together
with its variance 11,-;z are approximated by

control ancestry difference at gene or sub—network level using a
naive admixture mapping approach and computing the p—value
using the importance sampling approach. Let (BI-T}, and

1945), a non—parametric test of the null hypothesis that the gene—
specific ancestries from cases and controls are the same against an
alternative hypothesis. Because N increases, the sampling distribu—
tion of W converges to a normal distribution (Wilcoxon, 1945 ),
therefore we construct our weighted z—score as follows,

from enumeration of all possible combinations of W, given N.

omic coordinates for all genes from the NCBI ftp—server ftp://ftp.

quence. We assign the SNPs located within a gene or less than 40 kb

3 Results

3.1 Evaluating ancGWAS

Firstly, we evaluated ancGWAS using the data of a 4—way admixed
population simulated from 162 samples of North—west Europe
(CEU), 140 Yoruba (YRI), 82 Guraji indian (GIH) and 80 Chinese
(CHB) within two disease loci associated with the IL23R gene in the
chromosomal region 11731.3 and two other disease loci associated
with the SLCZAI gene in the chromosomal region 11734.2 (simula—
tion detail in Supplementary Text S5). We conducted the association
analysis on the causal simulated data set by applying EMMAX
(Kang et al., 2010), which accounts for both population

stratification and hidden relatedness. EMMAX could not identify
any significant SNPs, and failed to significantly identify the simu—
lated disease loci at SNPs 13841404 (P—values:2.84e — 05),
rsZZ97977 (P—values : 1.10e — 05), rs790633 (P—value : 0.002) and
rs6664119 (P—value:0.002) (Supplementary Table S1). However,
ancGWAS, in which the effect of several SNPs are combined within
a gene (see also Supplementary Text S6), detects the simulated
disease gene SLCZAI (P—value:2.98e — 12 and IL23R
(P—value : 2.16e — 04 based on Stouffer—Liptak statistics) and inter—
estingly other genes interacting with SLCZAI or IL23R which were
not of genome—wide significance from the standard GWAS are now
significant after combining effects of different SNPs within a gene
(Supplementary Table S1). Both our modified Stouffer—Liptak statis—
tical and Fishers combined probability tests produce similar results,
with no evidence of type I error (Supplementary Fig. S1).

We additionally analysed the ancestry of the GWAS data set
from causal simulation of a 4—way admixed population and com—
pared it to the true locus—specific ancestry generated from that par—
ticular simulation. We noted from our simulation (Supplementary
Text S5) that the ancestry—specific minor allele frequencies from the
correct proxy ancestral populations (Chimusa et al., 2013; Pasaniuc
et al., 2013) of the admixed population may serve to correct the
local ancestry bias along the genome of the admixed individuals. We
tested for unusual case—control difference in ancestry under the null
hypothesis at the gene level using a modified Wilcoxon signed—rank
statistic. The reported Wilcoxon P—values and its q—values in
Supplementary Table S1 suggest a significant signal of unusual dif—
ference in YRI ancestry from case and control samples at the IL23R
locus (57%, P—value : 5.21e — 08, q—value : 0.0005), consistent
with our simulation framework.

To fully characterize the susceptible genes and determine the
genetic structure of the simulated disease at the biological pathway
level, we conducted sub—network—specific association analysis using
ancGWAS. We built an LD—weighted network of 21 429 pair—wise
gene—gene interactions using the z—score method. We assessed
whether there is an opportunity of using topological properties of
the network as a factor for clustering. Supplementary Figure S2
shows that the network exhibits scale—free topology, meaning that
the degree distribution of genes approximates a power law
P(k) : [2”, where y z 2.19 is the degree exponent obtained by fit—
ting the model using the least—square approach. This indicates that
most genes have few interacting partners but some have many and
are crucial for the robustness of the network. In addition it also
shows that the network has a small world property, suggesting that
the spread of information in the network is achieved through an
average of 7.01 steps, which corresponds to the average shortest
communication in the network. We computed the cut—off for each
centrality measure (Supplementary Text S1), and the intersection of
the top genes from each measure were considered to be the set of
central nodes (hubs). To break down the network into sub—net—
works, we ran the searching algorithm described in Supplementary
Text S1. Using network centrality measures, we identified all the
central genes (hubs) by applying the cut—off for each centrality meas—
ure, and the intersection of the top genes from each measure were
considered to be the set of central genes (Mazandu and Mulder,
2011).

We assessed the significance of each sub—network using the
Stouffer—Liptak statistical and Fishers combined probability tests.
We adjusted the latter statistics using the Benjamini—Hochberg false—
discovery correction. To make sure that the score of a sub—network
did not occur by chance, we applied a permutation test based on the
bootstrap. Our implemented bootstrap method adjusts for the

dependency of P—values using a non—degenerate correlation matrix
and computes the related q—values (Supplementary Text S2).
Supplementary Table S2 displays the top 20 sub—networks ranked
by p—values and the overlap of each sub—network with known biolo—
gical pathways. 11 genes, including our simulated disease—genes and
their interacting genes, overlap between the top sub—network and
the metabolism pathway. From these top 20 sub—networks
(Supplementary Table S2), we identified the central sub—network
(Fig. 2) as the sub—network that has the connected hubs and overlap—
ping genes with the rest of top 19 sub—networks and performed
enrichment analysis as described in Section 2. This central sub—
network was found to be associated with the Integrin family cell
surface interactions pathway (z—score of overlap, 240: 1.6). The
overlapping set of genes includes our simulated disease genes
(SLCZAI and IL23R) and some of their interacting genes. In add—
ition, results of the causal simulation data set (Supplementary Table
S3) demonstrate evidence of unusual case—control difference in YRI
ancestry in one of these top 20 sub—networks, consistent with the
simulation. Finally, SLCZAI and UBC are the hubs of the central
sub—network (Fig. 2) and both genes are interacting (Wu et al.,
2009). This highlights the benefit of characterizing susceptible genes
beyond standard GWAS and demonstrates the ability of ancGWAS
(i) to examine the combined effects of genes by detecting genetic sig—
nals beyond a single SNP and (ii) to elucidate the interactions be—
tween genes underlying the pathogenesis of a simulated complex
disease that could not be detected in a standard GWAS analysis.
Next, to determine whether the ancGWAS approach is cali—
brated, we evaluated ancGWAS using a null simulated data set with—
out any simulated causal SNPs of a 4—way admixed population (see
Supplementary Text S6). We conducted the association analysis on
this simulated data by using EMMAX. As expected, from the top 19
SNPs displayed in Supplementary Table S4, no genome—wide signifi—
cance was observed. We applied ancGWAS to the resulting GWAS
data set, but when combining effects of different SNPs within a
gene, the result was still not significant (Supplementary Table S4),
although the top genes are associated with the top SNPs observed in
the standard GWAS analysis. In addition, no significant results were

Fig. 2. Central sub-network from the top 20 ranked sub-networks on
the causal simulation data of a 4-way admixed population. The central sub-
network in this figure is highly connected and related to the lntegrin family
cell surface interactions pathway (z-score of overlap: 1.6). The size of a node
denotes its statistical significance from small to large. Nodes are coloured ac-
cording to the ancestry proportions: red:YRl (Yoruba ancestry), blue: CEU
(European ancestry), green : CHB (Chinese ancestry) and yellow: GIH
(Gujarati Indian ancestry)

observed at the sub—network level (Supplementary Table S5). At
both gene and sub—network levels (Supplementary Tables S4 and
S5 ), the Wilcoxon signed—rank statistical test of unusual case—con—
trol difference in ancestry did not show any statistical significance
either. Overall, both the causal and null simulation of a 4—way
admixed population suggest that the approaches developed in
ancGWAS protect against false positives, and can unravel signals of
ancestry difference in disease risk.

Finally, we evaluated ancGWAS using a simulated pathway—
based GWAS data set (detail of simulation in Supplementary Text
S5). The standard single—marker—based association analysis using
EMMAX in Supplementary Table S6, failed to significantly identify
our three weak simulated interactive disease—associated loci with
very weak genetic effects (r52834287 associated with ATP50,
rs507238 associated with ATPIFI and r5225 0305 associated with
BTG3). We thus used a pathway—based approach in ancGWAS to
analyse the combined effect of all SNPs within a gene and genes
within a pathway, to detect the simulated interactive disease genes
with very weak genetic effects in the up—regulated aged mouse hypo—
thalamus pathway. We retained the resulting top 20 sub—networks,
and for each sub—network, we computed the number of genes over—
lapping between each sub—network and the up—regulated aged mouse
hypothalamus pathway (AGED_MOUSE_HYPOTH_UP), which is
our simulated pathway. Supplementary Table S7 displays the result
of ancGWAS, which was able to identify the up—regulated aged
mouse hypothalamus pathway, among the 20 top sub—networks
with 5 overlapping genes.

3.2 Application to CGEMS breast cancer data

We conducted an association analysis using data from the CGEMS
Breast Cancer study (see Supplementary Text S7), which included
1145 postmenopausal women of European ancestry with invasive
breast cancer (Hunter et al., 2007) and 1142 controls. We con—
ducted GWAS analysis based on the typed data set and imputed
missing SNPs using the 1000 Genomes reference panel (McVean et
al., 2012). Results from both GWAS on typed and genome—wide im—
putation data did not yield any significant association signal with
breast cancer (Supplementary Table S8). To account for possible
interacting cancer disease SNPs and moderate risk that did not reach
genome—wide significance in the standard GWAS, we applied
ancGWAS to the resulting GWAS data set containing 528 169 SNPs.
We identified a central sub—network (Fig. 3) and applied enrichment
analysis to it (see Supplementary Text S7 for more details). 63 genes
from the central sub—network overlapped those from the proteogly—
can syndecan—mediated signaling events pathway (z—score of overlap,
Z_w: 12.9). The overlap of the central sub—network (Fig. 3) and
this pathway includes 15 known or previously identified breast can—
cer genes (Supplementary Table 9) including BRCAI, TGFBRI,
BRCAZ, FANCA, MTR, MRPL19, CASPS, IGFBP3, IGFBPI,
VEGFA, IGFI, ATR, XRCC3, FGFRZ, CHEKZ. This is an import—
ant result, illustrating the benefit of incorporating both the associ—
ation signal from a standard GWAS and the human PPI network for
testing the combined effects of SNPs and searching for significantly
enriched sub—networks for complex diseases.

3.3 Comparing ancGWAS with deWAS

It is challenging to compare different pathway analysis methods be—
cause of the lack of accurate knowledge of complex traits and the in—
complete human protein interaction network (Wang et al., 2015a).
Most of these methods do not accept a user—defined network, only ac—
cept a short list of SNPs or genes, or use VEGAS (Liu et al., 2010) to

Fig. 3. Central sub-network of breast cancer. The size of a node denotes its

significance with size increasing with significance. Dark nodes or nodes
inside a contour denote previously identified breast cancer associated genes
or genes interacting with known breast cancer genes

map SNPs to genes, such as EW_deWAS, iPINBPA and PINBPA
(Wang et al., 2015a,b). This makes it impossible to directly compare
these methods to ancGWAS. Additional to GWAS summary statistics,
and although ancGWAS can use any weighted biological network, it
uses case—control genotype data sets to construct the weights of the
network, which current post—GWAS approaches do not account for.
deWAS (Jia et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015b) is currently the most
popular network—based approach that uses a similar strategy to
ancGWAS for mapping SNPs to genes and analysing GWAS data sets
at the gene and sub—network level. This makes it the most appropriate
tool to compare against ancGWAS and enables a reasonable compari—
son between these two approaches. The deWAS method uses the
dense module searching algorithm for identifying modules or sub—net—
works in massive networks. Their searching algorithm is based on a
greedy algorithm that searches for dense modules using two param—
eters: (i) the numerical parameter d, is the constraint distance for
which any node with a shortest path to another node greater than this
cut—off, will not be considered as an interacting neighbour, (ii) the par—
ameter r, which obstructs restriction on the score of the module (sub—
netvvork), and has a considerable effect on the result. Although the
new version of deWAS may use the edge—weighted PPI network,
the greedy searching algorithm and strategy used in both (Jia et al.,
2010; Wang et al., 2015b) don’t consider the topological properties
of biological networks. This may lead to less meaningful modules or
sub—networks (Mazandu and Mulder, 2011). Furthermore, the accur—
acy and performance of deWAS relies on the choice of these param—
eters (Jia et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015b). Supplementary Table S10,
provides a comparison of technical components implemented in both
ancGWAS and deWAS.

Because deWAS was not designed for admixed populations, we
firstly applied both ancGWAS and deWAS to the simulated path—
way—based GWAS data set (Supplementary Text S5 ) to compare their
ability to detect the simulated interactive disease genes with very
weak genetic effects in the up—regulated aged mouse hypothalamus
pathway. We retained the top 20 sub—networks from each approach.
For each sub—network from both approaches, we computed the
number of genes overlapping between each sub—network and the up—
regulated aged mouse hypothalamus pathway (simulated pathway).
The top 3 sub—networks from ancGWAS include the simulated disease
genes ATP50, ATPIFI and BTG3 while sub—networks from
deWAS had no overlaps with the simulated disease genes (Fig. 4).

Sub-networks

Fig. 4. Comparing deWAS and ancGWAS. (A) Number of overlaping genes
between the top sub-networks from deWAS and ancGWAS and the simu-
lated disease-susceptibility genes (DSG). (B) Number of overlapping genes
between top sub-networks from deWAS and ancGWAS and the entire dis-
ease pathway (AGEDiMOUSEiHYPOTH7UP). Line plot is ancGWAS and
circle plot is deWAS

This indicates that the top sub—networks from ancGWAS are more en—
riched disease genes than those obtained from deWAS. The advan—
tage of ancGWAS may be due to the usage of the topological
structure of the network and network communication to break down
the network into different sub—networks, as shown previously in
Wang et al. (2015a). We also applied both methods to the breast can—
cer GWAS data (Supplementary Text S5). The top sub—networks from
both methods are associated with proteoglycan syndecan-mediated
signaling events pathway. However, the numbers of overlapping
known breast cancer disease genes with these top sub—networks from
ancGWAS are greater than those from deWAS (see Supplementary
Table S9 and Supplementary Text S8 for more details).

4 Discussion

We introduced ancGWAS, a post GWAS method based on an alge—
braic graph—based approach that leverages the topological analysis
of the PPI network to (i) identify hub genes, and use their topo—
logical properties, (ii) identify the most meaningful and significant
genes or sub—networks relevant to a disease and those underlying
ethnic difference in disease risk in the case of admixed populations
and (iii) account for the correlation that exists between SNPs within
or between genes and genes within pathways. ancGWAS integrates
the association signal from standard GWAS data, the local ancestry
for admixed populations and the SNP LD into the human PPI net—
work. In addition, ancGWAS also handles other user—defined
weights such as topological weight. ancGWAS introduces ﬂexibility
in estimating gene— and sub—network—specific ancestry using the
inferred local ancestry from ancestry inference approaches such as in
(Baran et al., 2012). When ruling out the gene— and sub—network—
specific ancestry, the proposed method corrects for possible bias in
the inferred local ancestries obtained from current approaches of
local ancestry inference (Chimusa et al., 2012; Pasaniuc et al.,
2013). In addition, it tests for case—control unusual difference in an—
cestry at the gene and sub—network level using the corrected local an—
cestry of admixed populations.

We have done 3 types of simulation to test ancGWAS (i) causal
simulation (with some causal SNPs) on a 4—way admixed population
to test if ancGWAS can recover the GWAS signal and ancestry dif—
ferences, (ii) null simulation (without disease SNPs) on a 4—way
admixed population to test if ancGWAS produces a false signal
or type I error and (iii) pathway—based simulation with weak dis—
ease effect to test ancGWAS’s ability to recover interactive dis—
ease genes within a pathway. All simulated data sets are available
with the ancGWAS package, at http://www.cbio.uct.ac.za/
ancGWAS.

Our results from the causal simulation of a 4—way admixed
population; and the data set of invasive breast cancer demon—
strated that ancGWAS can recover weak and moderate association
signals from standard GWAS results by leveraging effects of all
SNPs within a gene and sub—network to unravel signals of possible
disease associated genes or pathways (further discussion in
Supplementary Text S9). Although our statistical methods account
for false discovery, we assessed the ability of ancGWAS to control
both type I and II errors based on null simulation with no causal
loci and causal simulation of disease loci in the simulation of an
admixed population, respectively. In these assessments, no false
positiveJnegative signals were identified (Supplementary Tables S1
and S4). Moreover, ancGWAS can detect ancestry differences in
admixed data as shown in Figure 2, which displays candidate an—
cestry difference at the generub—network level. However, our cur—
rent method cannot perform allelic tests of association directly
from the data, controlling for differences in gene/sub—network—spe—
cific ancestry (candidate peaks), as this is very challenging due to
gene—gene interactions (or considering sub—networks of iterative
genes). This would mean a large number of multi—locus genotype
combinations generated from large numbers of genetic variants,
leading to the so—called ’curse of dimensionality’ problem
(Bellman, 1961). Inferring accurate local ancestry is also
challenging (Chimusa et al., 2014; Pasaniuc et al., 2013) and cur—
rently we do not have access to a phenotypic data set of an
admixed population. Otherwise it would be interesting to apply
the proposed approach to such a population to evaluate the per—
formance of this approach in identifying the pathways associated
with a disease. The lack of accurate knowledge of complex traits
and the incomplete human protein interaction network makes it
challenging to directly compare the results from different pathway
analysis methods. Nevertheless, we used a GWAS data set of inva—
sive breast cancer (Supplementary Text S8) to compare ancGWAS
to deWAS. These results have shown that ancGWAS identified
more cancer associated genes in its results than deWAS, and
holds promise for deconvoluting the interactions between genes
underlying the pathogenesis of complex diseases. deWAS re—
cently released a new feature (Wang et al., 2015b) that uses gene
expression profiles for edge weights (Wang et al., 2015b).
However, because the new deWAS still uses the same greedy
searching algorithm to break down the biological network into
sub—networks, it still doesn’t take advantage of the topological
properties of biological networks like ancGWAS does.

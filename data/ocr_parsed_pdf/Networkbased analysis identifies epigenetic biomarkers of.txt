ABSTRACT

Motivation: A rapid progression of esophageal squamous cell carcin-
oma (ESCC) causes a high mortality rate because of the propensity for
metastasis driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations. The identifi-
cation of prognostic biomarkers would help prevent or control meta-
static progression. Expression analyses have been used to find such
markers, but do not always validate in separate cohorts. Epigenetic
marks, such as DNA methylation, are a potential source of more
reliable and stable biomarkers. Importantly, the integration of both
expression and epigenetic alterations is more likely to identify relevant
biomarkers.

Results: We present a new analysis framework, using ESCC progres-
sion-associated gene regulatory network (GRNescc), to identify differ-
entially methylated CpG sites prognostic of ESCC progression. From
the CpG loci differentially methylated in 50 tumor—normal pairs, we
selected 44 CpG loci most highly associated with survival and located
in the promoters of genes more likely to belong to GRNesoc. Using an
independent ESCC cohort, we confirmed that 8/10 of CpG loci in the
promoter of GRNescc genes significantly correlated with patient
sun/ival. In contrast, 0/10 CpG loci in the promoter genes outside
the GRNescc were correlated with patient survival. We further charac-
terized the GRNesoc network topology and observed that the genes
with methylated CpG loci associated with survival deviated from the
center of mass and were less likely to be hubs in the GRNescc. We
postulate that our analysis framework improves the identification of
bona fide prognostic biomarkers from DNA methylation studies, espe-
cially with partial genome coverage.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recently, systematic biological approaches to study cancer have
provided unprecedented Views of molecular changes in many can-
cers. For example, the mutagenesis within a network of general
human cancer signaling genes (Cui et al., 2007) and the protein
expression within a proteiniprotein interaction network (Ostlund
et al., 2010) have led to the discovery of subnetworks involving
cancer-related genes. The combination of proteiniprotein net-
works with gene expression microarray datasets has also been
used to distinguish metastatic from non-metastatic tumor samples
(Chuang et al., 2007; Garcia et al., 2012) or to identify biomarkers
correlated with patient survival (Li et al., 2012). More recently,
Sun and Wang (2013) used a genetic network as a reference to
estimate the penalty score of a conditional logistic regression
model and applied it on a matched tumorinormal analysis of
DNA methylation array data to identify a list of candidate
CpG sites associated with hepatocellular cancer development.
Kim et a]. (2012) attempted to integrate more biological resources
like the epigenomic, transcriptomic and protein interactome data
to identify glioblastoma prognostic biomarkers using gene expres-
sion and DNA methylation-based networks. Although DNA
methylation can be used as a powerful and promising prognostic
indicator alone (Laird, 2003), none of the aforementioned net-
work-based studies, integrating DNA methylation, gene expres-
sion or protein expression information performed experimental
validation of the identiﬁed biomarkers. This can be because of the
large number of candidate biomarkers within networks, making
their validation and use in the clinic more difﬁcult.

Affecting >450 000 patients annually, esophageal carcinoma
with squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) as the predominant histo-
logical subtype worldwide is the sixth leading cause of cancer-
related mortality, with >400 000 deaths per year (Pennathur
et al., 2013; van Hagen et al., 2012). Late presentation with
already existing lymph node metastasis (LNM) followed
by rapid progression explains the poor outcome of the disease
(Bollschweiler et al., 2006). Metastasis requires certain steps like
primary tumor initialization and proliferation, blood vessel/
lymphatic channel intravasation, cell arrest and extravasation

Network-based analysis identifies ESCC progression biomarkers

 

and proliferation at secondary target sites/organs (Hunter et al.,
2008). Metastasis can arise from tumor cells that have undergone
phenotypic changes called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), gaining plasticity and circulating and seeding ability.
There is no observable change in DNA methylation during the
transforming growth factor beta-mediated EMT in AML12
mouse hepatocyte (McDonald et al., 2011). But such DNA
methylation is able to be involved in gene regulation during
the EMT of prostate cell line, EP156T (Ke et al., 2010).
Identifying epigenetic alterations occurring during ESCC pro-
gression is therefore not only essential for a detailed understand-
ing of the molecular biology underlying the disease progression
but also to improve clinical prognosis and develop more sophis-
ticated treatment strategies.

Until now, only few genomic regions, such as the retrotrans-
poson-related long interspersed element 1 (Iwagami et al., 2013)
or the gene regulatory elements, showing methylation alterations
have been identiﬁed as possible biomarkers for LNM and/or pa-
tient survival in ESCC. Of the gene annotation-based studies,
hyper-methylation at CpG islands (CGIs) in the Vicinities of
PAX6 (paired box 6) and RN7SKP211 (RNA, 7SK small nuclear
pseudogene 211) were signiﬁcantly associated with LNM and dis-
ease-free survival in 96 patients (Gyobu et al., 201 1). Hyper-methy-
lated CGIs located within UCHLl (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal
esterase L1) (Mandelker et al., 2005), FHIT (fragile histidine triad)
(Lee et al., 2006), GRIN2B (glutamate receptor, ionotropic,
N-methyl D-aspartate 2B) (Kim et al., 2007) and GADD45G
(growth arrest and DNA-damage—inducible, gamma) (Guo et al.,
2013) promoter regions were associated with poor survival.
However, these studies only validated CpG sites in a small set of
candidate genes, therefore limiting the scope of the findings. A
more comprehensive analysis is likely to reveal new DNA methy-
lation as biomarkers associated with LNM and survival.

In this study, we use a new comprehensive approach to efﬁ-
ciently identify and validate DNA methylation sites as putative
prognostic biomarkers of ESCC progression. We propose an in-
tuitive framework, and demonstrate its ability to identify CpG
sites of prognostic value. The framework leverages an ESCC pro-
gression-associated gene regulatory network (GRNeSCC) to iden-
tify methylated sites with signiﬁcant prognostic value. By taking
into account differentially methylated CpG sites whose corres-
ponding gene promoters are ranked, the ranked CpG sites are
puriﬁed/selected Via a top-k precision test in network. We validate
the results on a selection of 20 CpG loci in a separate cohort of
ESCC patients and demonstrate that this framework is capable of
identifying novel sites of DNA methylation with prognostic
impact that had not been discovered by previous approaches.

2 METHODS

2.1 Patients and biopsy specimens

This study was veriﬁed and qualiﬁed by the institutional review board of
National Cheng Kung University Hospital from May 1, 2010 to July 31,
2011 under contract number ‘HR-99-021’. The ethics committee speciﬁc-
ally waived the need for informed consent forms because the data were
publicly obtained from an observational study and analyzed anonym-
ously. We enrolled 100 ESCC patients admitted to the Cancer Center
and Pathology department, National Cheng Kung University Hospital
(N = 80) and the Cancer Center, China Medical University Hospital

(N = 20). Primary ESCC specimens and matched normal tissues, located
>10 cm from the primary site, were collected through surgical resection.
Pathologic examination of the resected surgical specimens was performed
following a standardized protocol, and the specimens were classiﬁed
according to the sixth edition of the UICC TNM (Union for
International Cancer Control, TNM Classiﬁcation of Malignant
Tumours) system and the WHO classiﬁcation. Although surgically re-
sected tumor tissue and corresponding normal tissue samples were col-
lected from two separate hospitals, the samples were processed by the
same laboratory, using the same protocol, therefore limiting potential
batch effects. Follow-up of enrolled patients was performed at 6 months
interval, with the last follow-up performed at least 12 months and up to
104 months after diagnosis for living patients. The enrolled patients were
randomly split between screening (50 patients) and validation (50 pa-
tients) cohorts. The general clinioopathological characteristics of the en-
rolled patients are shown in Supplementary Table S1.

2.2 Construction of an ESCC-related gene regulatory
network

We built a general gene regulatory network (GRNg) using three publicly
available networks: Pathway Commons (11/2011 version; Cerami et al.,
2011), BioGRID 3.1.79 (Stark et al., 2006) and KEGG (Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) (09/2011 version; Ogata et al.,
1999). The consolidated network features 1294 769 gene regulations
(edges) and 12803 genes (nodes). In this study, we focused more on
direct gene regulations because the DNA methylation is a major epigen-
etic event that blocks binding of transcription factors to promoters of
target genes, or modiﬁes chromatin structure, which in turn blocks tran-
scription factor binding (Suzuki and Bird, 2008). Therefore, only inter-
actions derived from transcriptional regulation were considered,
excluding proteiniprotein and protein compound interactions. We then
generated GRNew. We selected 186 genes by curating the literature and
identiﬁed genes whose expression pattern is associated with ESCC pro-
gression (Supplementary Table S2) before January 2012. The progression
refers to the cancer metastasis, proliferation, arrest, invasion and patient
survival. We excluded genes showing differential expression between
tumor and normal but that could not be associated with ESCC progres-
sion. We then generated the GRNESCC as a subnetwork of GRNg using the
following steps: (i) Initiate an empty distance matrix with a length equal
to the number of literature-curated genes, (186 x 186), (ii) calculate the
shortest distance between each pair of genes projected on GRNg using the
Dijkstra’s algorithm and (iii) calculate the shortest paths of each pair of
genes on GRNew, using a breadth-first search algorithm. The resulting
GRNESCC contained 1013604 interactions between 4636 genes. A non-
ESCC progression-associated gene regulatory network (GRNg_ew) was
also derived from the complement of GRNESCC in GRNg. More precisely,
after generating the GRNew, via the above three steps, every gene (node)
of GRNESCC and its connected genegene regulations (edges) in GRNg
were removed from GRNg. We therefore called the rest part GRNwsm
as a negative control used in this study.

2.3 Generation and analysis of DNA methylation
microarray data

2.3.] M icroarray data generation The genomic DNA from primary
ESCC and normal esophagus specimen was extracted using proteinase
K digestion and phenolwhloroform extraction. One microgram of DNA
was then converted using bisulﬁte following the directions from the
EpiTect Bisulﬁte kit (Qiagen, Duesseldorf, Germany), converting
unmethylated cytosines to uracil and then to thymidine in the subsequent
PCR step. We used the Illumina’s GoldenGate Methylation Assay
Cancer Panel I (1505 CpG dinucleotides located in the promoter of
807 genes; Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the

manufacturer’s instructions. The data are available at the NCBI/GEO
database (GSE51287).

2.3.2 Microarray data analysis The ratio of ﬂuorescent signals was
computed from the two alleles beta = (max(M, 0))/(|U| -l- |M| -l- 100),
where U is the green ﬂuorescent signal (Cy3) from an unmethylated
allele and M is the red signal (CyS) from a methylated allele, generated
by the Illumina’s proprietary software (BeadStudio). The beta-value re-
ﬂects the methylation level of each CpG site (Bibikova et al., 2006), and
their distribution is shown in Supplementary Figure SlA. To allow fur-
ther statistical analyses able to be applicable to these values across dif-
ferent samples, the beta-values were then normalized using the function
of normalizeloess implemented in Bioconductor affy package with four
parameters including epsilon (0.01), log.it (F), span (0.4) and maxit (5).
Then we kept all normalized values positive by adding an absolute (the
minimum value). Their distribution is shown in Supplementary Figure
SlB. We identified signiﬁcantly differentially methylated CpG sites
between tumor and normal using a two-tailed Student’s t-test
(P<0.05). CpG loci had a signiﬁcant increase (respectively decrease)
in methylation when methylation is increased by N-fold or greater
(respectively iN-fold) in the tumor compared with normal, with N cor-
responding to the median of absolute fold changes between tumor and
normal.

2.3.3 Identification of CpG sites associated with progression We
constructed a contingency table for each signiﬁcantly different CpG site,
counting the number of patients with or without LNM and for which the
probe signiﬁcantly increased or decreased methylation CpG. This table
can be used to analyze the relationships between two categorical
variables: methylation change in tumor (increase/ decrease) and metastasis
status (NO/N1). We then calculated, for each CpG site, the following
six correlation metrics for each CpG site: PhiCoefﬁcient (Cramer,
1946), OddsRatio (Edwards, 1963), PiatetskyShapiroMeasure (Piatetsky-
Shapiro, 1991), LiftMeasure (Tufféry, 2011), AddedValue (Sahar and
Mansour, 1999) and KlosgenMeasure (Klosgen, 1992). The detailed equa-
tions are given as Supplementary Method S1. For each of these metrics, a
positive value indicates a positive correlation between the direction of the
methylation change and the LNM status, at each CpG site. This resulted
in the identiﬁcation of 130 progression-associated CpG sites.

2.3.4 Identiﬁcation of CpG sites associated with survival The last
follow-up of enrolled patients was performed at least 12 months after
diagnosis for living patients. The ﬁrst group (‘Good’ survival) included
patients who were still alive after 12 months following tumor resection
and the second group (‘Bad’ survival) consisted of patients who died
within 12 months post-resection. Coincidentally, the two groups have
the identical number of patients. As a consequence, a perfect classiﬁer
would separate the cohort into two groups of equal size. For this reason,
we imposed the comparisons with groups of patients of equal size, and
grouped them according to the methylation change of the tested CpG: we
ranked patients according to their fold methylation change [FC = log
(tumor/normal)] of the probe, and automatically selected the FC thresh-
old (FCl) leading to an equal number of patients with FC<7FCl
(decreased-methylation) and FC> FCl (increased-methylation). The as-
sociation with survival was determined by preforming a logrank-test.

2.4 Network analysis

The top-k precision (TP) is an ubiquitous correlation metric (Fagin et al.,
2003). To test whether the top-ranked CpG sites are prevalent in a net-
work, the measurement is given by the following two equations.

E<GRN, 6:) = {5: 25:23
where GRN represents the processed network, and G,- represents the cur-
rently indexed gene promoter probe containing a CpG site within a list of

ranked CpG sites.

2.5 Pyrosequencing validation and survival analysis

The bisulﬁte-oonverted DNA was pyrosequenced using the PyroMark
Q24 (Qiagen). We designed speciﬁc pyrosequencing primer and PCR
primer using the specialized software (PyroMark Assay Design 2.0) to
target the CpG sites in the promoter region of selected gene
(Supplementary Table S3). Bisulﬁte-modified DNA was dissolved in
20 a1 H20, and 1 pl of DNA template was used for PCR ampliﬁcation.
Hot-start PCR was performed with PyroMark PCR Kit (Qiagen), and
pyrosequencing was carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Qiagen). The target CpG sites were evaluated by converting the resulting
pyrograms to numerical values for peak heights. The percentage of
methylation was calculated as the mean of all CpG analyzed (V aissiere
et al., 2009). We ﬁnally performed a survival analysis by using these
methylation percentages to validate the screening cohort-derived candi-
date probes containing CpG sites.

2.6 Quantitative RT-PCR

For the mRNA quantiﬁcations, we performed SYBR Green and
TaqMan® Gene Expression Assay (Life Technologies Corporation)
qRT-PCR methods to detect mRNAs in the same validation cohort. If
genes were not suitable for the primer design of SYBR Green qRT-PCR,
we alternatively performed the TaqMan® method using its commercial
primers (Supplementary Table S4). We analyzed the results using the
cycle threshold method (Ct). Only strong signals with high expressions
(Ct< 35) were used for a further correlation analysis with promoter
methylation.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Overall framework and ESCC network construction

Cancer metastatic progression may be associated with multiple
gene regulatory changes, some of them mediated by aberrant
promoter CpG methylation. To identify the CpG probes where
methylation is the most associated with disease progression, we
propose the following framework comprising five different steps.
(i) We construct a disease-specific gene regulatory network.
This is done by extracting the minimal path subnetwork contain-
ing genes important for the disease progression, as identiﬁed
through manually curated references (Fig. 1 panel I). The
complement of this subnetwork in the global network is
extracted and used as a negative control (see also Section 2.2).
(ii) We identify cancer-speciﬁc CpG methylation events (Fig. 1
panel II), then (iii) we select CpG sites where methylation change
is the most associated with progression (Fig. 1 panel III). (iv)
We then rank these candidate CpG sites by the association of
the methylation change with patient’s survival (Fig. 1 panel IV),
and ﬁnally (V) we use the disease-speciﬁc network to select the
top candidate CpG sites associated with disease progression and
patient’s survival (Fig. 1 panel V). Applying this approach
to ESCC progression, we ﬁrst built a GRNg using publicly
available networks (Section 2). This GRNg features 1294769
gene regulations (edges) and 12803 genes (nodes). We then
extracted the minimal-path subnetwork featuring 186 genes

associated with ESCC progression (Section 2 and Supplementary
Table S2). This GRNeSCC contains 1013 604 interactions between
4636 genes. Finally, we derived a non-ESCC—associated
gene regulatory network (GRNg_eSCC) from the complement
of GRNeSCC in GRNg. A Gene Ontology (GO) analysis
(Dennis et al., 2003) revealed that the genes in GRNeSCC
were enriched in biological processes such as chemotaxis, cell
adhesion, cell migration and angiogenesis, compared with
the GRNg_eSCC (Fig. 2). These processes are important for metas-
tasis and cancer progression. This observation indicates that
the genes in GRNeSCC are related to cancer progression, extending
our initial gene list and likely accounting for unsuspected
regulatory patterns important for disease progression and
metastasis.

3.2 Identiﬁcation of candidate CpG sites associated with
ESCC progression

Using a microarray, we measured the methylation status of 1505
CpG sites located in the promoter of 807 cancer-related genes in
50 ESCC tumors and matched normal esophageal tissue. We
identiﬁed 309 differentially methylated sites between tumor and
normal (t-test nominal P<0.05), of which 108 and 201 had
decreased and increased methylation in the tumor, respectively.
We then determined which CpG sites were associated with cancer
progression, e.g. lymph node metastasis, in our cohort. Using a
compendium of six correlation metrics, we looked for CpG site
with significant changes in methylation in the tumor of meta-
static patients (LNM classiﬁcation N1). Using this approach, we
were able to identify 130 CpG sites in the promoter of 109 genes,
which are associated with ESCC lymph node metastasis. To
characterize these sites and extract a specific ESCC progression
epigenetic signature, we further analyzed them using the global
regulatory network.

3.3 Network-based selection of Candidate CpG sites
associated with survival

To increase our conﬁdence in the biological significance of the
CpG sites identiﬁed above, we calculated their association with
patient survival. Using a dynamic classiﬁcation of patients with
increased and decreased CpG methylations to compare groups of
the same size (section 2.3.4), we ranked the 130 CpG sites by
decreasing association of their methylation status and patient
survival (log-rank test P—Value). To further select the CpG sites
where methylation status is the most likely to be associated with

disease progression, we examined the genes associated with them
and how well they map to the GRNeSCC network. We noticed that
the top-ranked genes were prominent in the GRNeSCC network,
compared with random (Top-k precision, Fig. 3A). In contrast,
the top-ranked genes were depleted in the GRNg_eSCC network
compared with random (Fig. 3B). This observation therefore
suggests that our methodology enriches for CpG sites located
in the promoters of genes important for progression and
survival.

To further distinguish the relative importance of increase and
decrease in methylation at the CpG sites in the promoter of the
genes in the networks, we split the ranked list of 130 CpG sites in
equal size bins of decreasing association with survival (Fig. 3C).
There was no signiﬁcant bias between increased and decreased
methylation at CpG in the promoters of these genes, indicating
that both repression and activation of genes in the network may
contribute to ESCC progression.

We finally selected 44 best candidate CpG sites (Fig. 3A 7
arrow) for further analysis (Supplementary Table S5). Of the
44 CpG sites, 22 were located in the promoters of genes belong-
ing to GRNeSCC (referred to as In—CpG sites) and 22 where in
promoters of genes outside GRNeSCC (referred to as Out-CpG
sites). This enrichment of CpG with changing methylation
is signiﬁcantly different from what can be expected by chance
(x2 test P< 0.0001). Moreover, only 5 of the 22 In—Cst and

none of the 11 Out-Cst were located in the promoters of the
186 genes that seeded the GRNeSCC network, suggesting that the
In—CpG methylation changes were likely to be associated with
progression and close to the 186 genes in network. To confirm
this possibility, we compared the average distance between the
186 seed genes and the genes whose promoters have CpG methy-
lation changes associated with progression. Of the 22 Out-CpG
sites, 11 were located in the promoters of genes belonging to
GRNg_eSCC (referred to as Out-CpGg_eSCC sites), and 11 were in
the promoters of genes not represented in the GRNg network.
The genes with In—CpG were significantly closer to a seed gene
than the genes with Out-CpGg_eSCC (average distance of 2.7 versus
3.2, t-test P—Value<1E-30). The average distance of genes with
In—CpG to a seed gene is in fact similar to the average distance
of the seed genes between themselves (2.7 versus 2.6, t-test
P—Value = 3.6E-09). This suggests that network approach en-
ables the identiﬁcation of CpG methylation changes in the pro-
moter of genes not previously associated with progression and,
therefore, increases the number of potential prognostic bio-
markers that can be tested. Moreover, although both inside
and outside the GRNeSCC had the identical number (22) of
genes, the 22 genes in GRNeSCC were originally from top-
ranked genes (Fig. 3A and B and Supplementary Table S?
the median rank of In—CpG sites versus the median rank of
Out-CpG sites = 18 versus 27). The 22 In—CpG sites in genes
from GRNeSCC are therefore more likely to have a methylation
status associated with ESCC metastatic progression and are
good candidates to test their prognostic value.

3.4 Validation of the ﬁndings

To validate the association between these candidate CpG sites
methylation and survival (Fig. 1 panel VI), we decided to meas-
ure the association in a new cohort (validation cohort) of 50
patients with ESCC and matched normal esophageal tissues.
We were able to design speciﬁc primers for 10 In—Cst as well
as 10 control Out-Cst (Section 2 and Supplementary Table
S3).

We first checked the validity of the methodology by determin-
ing the methylation level of these 20 CpG sites in the screening
cohort (N = 50 patients). This analysis showed that the methy-
lation level determined by pyrosequencing was highly correlated
with the one obtained from the microarray (Supplementary Fig.
S2; r = 0.78), therefore demonstrating the technical validity of
the approach. We then examined the methylation of these 20
Cst in the validation cohort (N = 50 patients). We ﬁrst noticed
that, the methylation change is signiﬁcant in 12/20 CpG
(P< 10%), either through increased (N = 7) or decreased methy-
lation (N = 5) in the tumor. Additionally, the methylation
changes of 8/ 10 In—Cst and 0/ 10 Out-CpG were associated
with patient survival (Table lilog-rank test P<0.05). Of eight
validated In—Cst, only one is located in the promoter of a seed
gene (MAPK4, Supplementary Table S2), suggesting the
increased sensitivity provided by the network approach. To fur-
ther conﬁrm the association between methylation changes and
survival, we performed a Cox regression analysis using SPSS V17
on the methylation changes in addition to other clinical variable
(Supplementary Table S6). We calculated the hazard ratio (HR)
of cancer death risk of variables including promoter methylation

change, TNM stage, local LNM status, distant metastases status,
age and drinking status. This analysis showed that methylation
changes at ﬁve of eight validated In—Cst and distant metastasis
were associated with a signiﬁcantly increased risk (HR> 1)
or decreased risk (HR<1) of cancer-related death, and three
In—Cst showed a borderline signiﬁcance, while none of the
methylation changes at Out-Cst (negative control group) was
associated with the risk of cancer-related death. A multivariate
analysis further showed that 5/8 validated In—Cst remain sig-
niﬁcant association with prognosis even after accounting for the
presence of distant metastasis.

The validation results (Table 1), including the methylation
changes between tumor and normal tissues and the direction of
survival associations, of all of the eight validated Cst were
consistent with the results in the screening cohort
(Supplementary Table S7 and Supplementary Fig. S3). These
results suggest that, despite the limitation of the cohort size to
identify signiﬁcant methylation changes in the tumors, the net-
work-based framework was able to enrich for CpG sites signiﬁ-
cantly associated with survival.

Promoter CpG methylation usually results in transcriptional
repression. In Supplementary Figure S4, we measured the expres-
sion changes between normal esophagus and ESCC for six genes
with strong reliable signals (Section 2) in the GRNeSCC and whose
promoters contain CpG associated with survival. We can identify
trends for negative correlation for four increased methylation
Cst or positive correlation for two decreased methylation
Cst at least 10 patients in the validation cohort. Referring to

previous literature, a hyper-methylated CpG island located
5300bp upstream from the transcriptional start site of PAX6
was found to date as the only biomarker to be associated with
LNM (Gyobu et al., 2011). However, the authors claimed that
although this CpG island was unlikely to be associated with re-
pression of PAX6, it was quantiﬁed in four ESCC cell lines in
three of which PAX6 was expressed in spite of CpG island
methylation. Their results suggested that the methylation status
would not always correlate with gene expression. Therefore, in
agreement with this study, our results indicate that methylation
changes at selected CpG sites can be good prognostic markers
even in absence of a clear effect on transcriptional regulation.
A role for inﬂammation in tumorigenesis is emerging.
Inﬂammatory responses play pivotal roles at tumor progression
including tumor initiation, promotion, invasion and metastasis.
Tumors are frequently surrounded by an inﬂammatory micro-
environment rich in cytokines, chemokines and immune cells in-
ﬁltration, which promote malignant cellular growth. These
factors are produced by the tumor cells or its surrounding tissue
and contribute to malignant progression (Grivennikov et al.,
2010). Interestingly, we also validated several genes associated
with inﬂammation. For example, CCL3 is a cytokine in the
TNF inﬂammation pathway (Wang et al., 2013), and JAK3 is
predominantly expressed in immune cells and transduces a signal
in response to its activation Via tyrosine phosphorylation by
interleukin receptors (Krejsgaard et al., 2011). Different cyto-
kines can either promote or inhibit tumor development and pro-
gression (Lin and Karin, 2007). Previous studies indicated that

C.-P.Cheng et al.

 

interleukin 6 (IL-6), a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine that mediates
chronic inﬂammation, may play an import role in inﬂammation-
driven oral carcinogenesis. Notably, Jacqueline and associates
recently found that IL-6 induces hyper-methylation and gene
silencing mediated by DNMTs (mammalian DNA methyltrans-
ferases) (Gasche et al., 2011). In this study, the changes of global
DNA methylation and gene-specific promoter methylation pat-
terns by IL-6 treatment in oral cancer cells were examined. The
increased promoter methylation changes were identiﬁed in sev-
eral tumor suppressor genes, including CHFR, GATA5 and
PAX6 (Gasche et al., 2011). Of these, we conﬁrmed PAX6
with increased methylation in ESCC. Together, the role of in-
ﬂammation in relation of promoter methylation of PAX6, C CL3
and JAK3 in ESCC tumor microenvironment is worthy of fur-
ther investigation.

3.5 GRNescc network topology

In an effort to understand better the importance of the network
in identifying signiﬁcant associations with cancer progression
and survival, we characterized further the network topology.
Previous studies have shown that the network topology of cer-
tain genes might have functional implications in a cell. For ex-
ample, an enrichment of genes having lethal knockout
phenotypes possessed a high-degree (hub) property in a
Saccharomyces cerivisiae gene co-expression network (Carter
et al., 2004). Therefore, it is plausible that the CpG methylation
changes of promoters of genes in GRNeSCC might have certain
interesting distributions. We examined whether the gene pro-
moters contain differentially methylated CpG possessed speciﬁc
characteristics in the GRNeSCC network. We ranked these genes
based on their decreasing association with patient survival. We

noticed that both the barycenter score (White and Smyth, 2003)
and the closeness centrality (Opsahl et al., 2010) showed a nega-
tive correlation with significance (Fig 4A and B). This observa-
tion suggests that the genes associated with survival tend to
deviate from the center of mass of the GRNeSCC and to be
more located at the periphery of the network. This is similar to
a recent work that age-associated epigenetic drift occurs prefer-
entially in genes that occupy peripheral network positions (West
et al., 2013). In another analysis shown in Figure 4C and D,
the signiﬁcance for survival was negatively correlated with the
Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) hub and the HITS au-
thority (Kleinberg, 1999). Derived for algorithms used to rate
web pages based on topic signiﬁcance, this observation again
suggests that the ESCC progression genes are not the most con-
nected nodes but rather stem away from them.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we proposed a new framework that uses literature-
guided GRN to enhance the results and interpretation of DNA
methylation microarray experiments. Speciﬁcally, the framework
helps prioritize differentially methylated genes for their impact
on cancer progression and survival. We validated the results in
an independent cohort and conﬁrmed that the selected CpG sites
were signiﬁcantly associated with patient survival, even in ab-
sence of a direct correlation with the gene expression. Eight of
10 validated CpG sites significantly correlated with patient sur-
vival. These were located in the promoters of JAK3, PAX 6, E2F5
and CD8] (increased methylation), and in the promoters of
CCL3, INS, MAPK4 and PGR (decreased methylation).
Interestingly, the position of the survival-associated genes in
the GRNeSCC network signiﬁcantly deviated from the center of
mass. We postulate that the topology of progression-associated
network could help identify progression-associated genes before
any data collection. Our results demonstrate that the use of regu-
latory networks and prior expression studies can help identify
bona ﬁde DNA-methylation prognostic biomarkers. Although
our focus is the identiﬁcation of biomarkers for a clinical use
Via a methodological innovation, the functional exploration of
these biomarkers is also worthy of further investigation.

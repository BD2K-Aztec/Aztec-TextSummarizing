ABSTRACT

Motivation: To date, gene set analysis approaches primarily focus on
identifying differentially expressed gene sets (pathways). Methods for
identifying differentially coexpressed pathways also exist but are
mostly based on aggregated pairwise correlations or other pairwise
measures of coexpression. Instead, we propose Gene Sets Net
Correlations Analysis (GSNCA), a multivariate differential coexpression
test that accounts for the complete correlation structure between
genes.

Results: In GSNCA, weight factors are assigned to genes in propor-
tion to the genes’ cross-correlations (i ntergene correlations). The prob-
lem of finding the weight vectors is formulated as an eigenvector
problem with a unique solution. GSNCA tests the null hypothesis
that for a gene set there is no difference in the weight vectors of the
genes between two conditions. In simulation studies and the analyses
of experimental data, we demonstrate that GSNCA captures changes
in the structure of genes’ cross-correlations rather than differences in
the averaged pairwise correlations. Thus, GSNCA infers differences in
coexpression networks, however, bypassing method-dependent
steps of network inference. As an additional result from GSNCA, we
define hub genes as genes with the largest weights and show that
these genes correspond frequently to major and specific pathway
regulators, as well as to genes that are most affected by the biological
difference between two conditions. In summary, GSNCA is a new
approach for the analysis of differentially coexpressed pathways that
also evaluates the importance of the genes in the pathways, thus
providing unique information that may result in the generation of
novel biological hypotheses.

Availability and implementation: Implementation of the GSNCA test
in R is available upon request from the authors.

1 INTRODUCTION

Large-scale biological research, including genetic linkage/associ-
ation studies, copy number variation, microarray and RNA-Seq
expression experiments, typically compare two or more different
phenotypes to infer a unique genetic background, associated with

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

a particular phenotype. A decade ago, the methods for such
analyses were dominated by univariate two-sample statistical
tests, which frequently fell short from a statistical and a biolo-
gical perspective because of two reasons. First, small changes in
expression cannot be captured for a single gene using two-sample
tests (e.g. t-statistic) with the correction for multiple testing
(Mootha et al., 2003). Second, genes do not work in isolation
but interact with each other collectively; as a consequence, stat-
istical tests need to account for a multivariate nature of expres-
sion changes (Emmert—Streib and Glazko, 2011; Glazko and
Emmert—Streib, 2009). These shortcomings catalyzed the appear-
ance of conceptually new methodologies for the analysis of gen-
omic data. Instead of considering a single gene as an expression
unit, new methodologies started to operate with gene sets (cor-
responding, e.g. to biological pathways), considering a gene set
as the unit of expression. The ﬁrst test of this kind was the gene
set enrichment analysis (Mootha et al., 2003). To date many
methodologies for testing the differential expression of gene
sets (molecular pathways, biological processes) have been sug-
gested and are collectively named gene set analysis (GSA)
approaches (Ackermann and Strimmer, 2009; Dinu et al.,
2009; Emmert—Streib and Glazko, 2011; Huang da et al., 2009).
GSA approaches can be either competitive or self-contained.
Competitive approaches compare a gene set against its comple-
ment that contains all genes except genes in the set, and self-
contained approaches compare whether a gene set is differen-
tially expressed between two phenotypes (Goeman and
Buhlmann, 2007; Tian et al., 2005). Unfortunately, some com-
petitive GSA approaches are inﬂuenced by the genomic coverage
and the filtering of the data and can increase their power by the
addition of unrelated data and even noise (Tripathi et al., 2013).
Owing to these problems, we focus in this article on self-
contained methods only. Self-contained approaches, depending
on the statistics used for the testing, test different null hypotheses
(Emmert—Streib and Glazko, 2011; Glazko and Emmert—Streib,
2009; Rahmatallah et al., 2012). The possibility to formulate
different statistical hypotheses enables the formulation and
exploration of different biological hypotheses. However, for
GSA approaches, testing hypotheses other than the equality of
the mean expression vectors remains underexplored. We recently
suggested to extend a univariate analysis of differential gene vari-
ability (Ho et al., 2008) to a multivariate case of gene sets
(Rahmatallah et al., 2012) with a multivariate non-parametric
‘radial’ KolmogoroveSmirnov test, sensitive to alternatives that

Gene Sets Net Correlations Analysis

 

have similar mean vectors but are different in their scale
(Friedman and Rafsky, 1979). We found that for several
tumor types, the pathways, detected exclusively by the radial
KolmogoroveSmirnov test, were mostly tumor-speciﬁc, whereas
the pathways with differences in the mean expression vectors
were detected simultaneously in different tumor types
(Rahmatallah et al., 2012). The main focus of this article is to
develop a novel multivariate differential coexpression analysis
approach for gene sets.

The first approach for testing the differential coexpression of
gene pairs, tested the equality of pairwise correlations to identify
gene pairs with correlated expression patterns in one phenotype
but not the other (Dawson and Kendziorski, 2012; Fukushima,
2013; Yu et al., 2011). Its extension to the general multivariate
case, involving gene sets with >2 genes, depends on the biological
context. When there are no a priori defined gene sets available,
the simplest way of differential coexpression analysis, imple-
mented in the R package CoXpress, is to ﬁnd clusters of coex-
pressed genes in one condition and check whether these clusters
show no correlation in another condition (Watson, 2006).
Another approach, e.g. implemented in the R package
DiffCoEx, constructs adjacency matrices of all genes under
different conditions, transforms adjacency matrices into a
matrix of adjacency differences and uses a topological overlap
measure to infer clusters of differentially coexpressed genes
(Tesson et al., 2010). When there are a priori deﬁned gene sets
available, the differential coexpression of gene sets can be found
by using the gene sets coexpression analysis (GSCA) (Choi and
Kendziorski, 2009). In this approach, the Euclidian distance be-
tween two correlation vectors (constructed from diagonal matri-
ces of pairwise correlations for different conditions) is calculated
and the significance of the difference is estimated using permu-
tation test. The differentially coexpressed gene sets (dCoxS)
method is similar to GSCA in its overall strategy. First, the
gene’s pairwise coexpressions are characterized separately for
two conditions, and second, the similarities of these characteris-
tics are estimated (Cho et al., 2009). The dCoxS uses relative
entropy matrices in place of correlation matrices, as used
by GSCA, and the correlation coefﬁcient between the upper-
diagonal elements of these matrices as a measure of their simi-
larity. The new property of dCoxS is that the coexpression of two
different pathways can also be estimated (Cho et al., 2009). There
are also other approaches for the differential coexpression ana-
lysis of gene sets (Emmert-Streib, 2007; Freudenberg et al., 2010;
Yu and Bai, 2011); the common aspect of all these approaches is
that they account for changes in aggregate measures of pairwise
correlations only.

In this article, we present a novel approach that assesses multi-
variate changes in the gene coexpression network between two
conditions. Importantly, we do not infer ‘gene coexpression net-
works’ explicitly, but, instead, we estimate net correlation
changes by introducing for each gene a weight factor that char-
acterizes its cross-correlations in the coexpression networks.
Weight vectors in both conditions are found as eigenvectors of
correlation matrices with zero diagonal elements. The Gene Sets
Net Correlations Analysis (GSNCA) tests the hypothesis that
for a gene set there is no difference in the gene weight vectors
between two conditions.

Furthermore, we suggest a new graphical Visualization to pre-
sent the full coexpression network that highlights the most highly
correlated genes, using the union of the ﬁrst and second min-
imum spanning trees (MST2). We show that genes in the center
of MST2 have large weights, and we demonstrate that hub
genesigenes with the largest weight in the pathwaysi
correspond in real data frequently to pathway regulators. In pre-
vious studies, MST was mainly used for cluster analysis in gene
expression studies. For instance, Xu et a]. (2001) suggested gene
expression data clustering based on MST, which rigorously con-
verts a multidimensional clustering problem to a tree partitioning
problem. Prom-On et a]. (2011) presented a method to improve
the biological relevance in the inference of functional modules
from the gene expression data by enhancing the structure of a
weighted gene coexpression network using MST. However, to
our knowledge, no attempt has been made so far to present
the full coexpression network that highlights the most highly
correlated genes Via MST2 structure.

We choose to compare GSNCA with the GSCA (Choi
and Kendziorski, 2009), as the idea behind GSCAﬁzomparing
pairwise measures of the genes coexpression between two
conditionsiis frequently used in other approaches (e.g.
dCoxS). The conceptual differences between our approach and
GSCA are illustrated in simulations as well as in the application
to two gene expression data sets.

2 METHODS

In the following, we are considering two biological conditions with dif-
ferent outcomes, with m samples of expression measurements of [7 genes
(that form a gene set) for the ﬁrst, and n2 samples of measurement of the
same [7 genes for the second conditions. Let R, with elements r,-,~ denote a
p x [7 gene correlation matrix (I = 1, 2) for a given condition. Let
N, denote a completely connected coexpression network (1:1, 2), with
[7 nodes (genes) and p(p-1)/2 edges, where the weight of an edge between
any two nodes i and j is given by 1- |r,-,~| (correlation distance).

The organization of this section is as follows: the GSNCA and the
GSCA, we use for comparison, are explained in Section 2.1. The MST
approach for the visualization of a backbone of coexpression network is
given in Section 2.2, and the simulation setup is outlined in Section 2.3.
Section 2.4 presents the biological datasets we use to demonstrate the
performance of GSNCA and GSCA. All computations in this work
were implemented using the R (version 2.15.3) computing language.

2.1 Gene sets net correlations analysis

To quantitatively characterize the importance of gene i in a correlation
network, we introduce a weight (w,) and set w,- to be proportional to a
gene’s cross-correlation with all the other genes. Then, the objective is to
ﬁnd a weight vector w, which achieves equality between a gene weight and
the sum of its weighted cross-correlations for all genes simultaneously.
Thus, genes with high cross-correlations will have high weights that may
indicate their regulatory importance. This problem can be formulated as
a system of linear equations

wi=ijrij,15i5p (1)
#i
or equivalently in matrix form
(R - 0W = W (2)

This is an eigenvector problem that has a unique solution when the
eigenvalue Aug,” 2 1, w> 0. Because the matrix (R — I) is not guaranteed

to have eigenvalue 20;,” = 1, we introduce a multiplicative factor, y,
which ensures a proper scaling for eigenvalues and solves the following
problem

i/(R - 0W = W (3)

Because the matrix R is non-negative, irreducible, symmetric and has
unity diagonal elements, its eigenvalues are real and from the Perrone
Frobenius theorem for non-negative matrices (Meyer, 2001); it follows
that R has a largest eigenvalue 21 = 2* >1, with a multiplicity of 1 and
the other (p-l) eigenvalues all satisfy i211 <2* for jgé 1. This eigenvalue
corresponds to a unique positive eigenvector v* such that Rv* = 2* v*.

PROPOSITION. For a non-negative irreducible correlation matrix R, solving
y(R — I)w = w as an eigenvector problem for w>0 has the unique solu-
tion w: v*, where v* is the positive eigenvector corresponding to the
largest real eigenvalue of R (2*). This solution is achievable if the follow-
ing condition is met

PROOF OF PROPOSITION. We solve y(R — I)w = w for w>0 as an eigen-
vector problem where the unique solution is the eigenvector of matrix
y(R — 1) corresponding to 2mg,” 2 1. Setting y = 1/22‘Rin where 2:114)
is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix (R — I) guarantees that the largest
eigenvalue of matrix y(R — I) will be 1, and consequently the correspond-
ing eigenvector is the unique solution. Because the matrices R and
y(R — I) have the same eigenvectors, the unique solution is w: v*,
where v* is the positive eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigen-
value of R. Because the eigenvalues of the matrix (R — I) are exactly 1 less
than the eigenvalues of matrix R, y = 1/22‘Rin = 1/(2* — 1), whereas 2*
is the largest eigenvalue of R.

As a test statistic, WGSNCA, we use the L1 norm between the scaled
weight vectors w“) and we) (each vector is multiplied by its norm to
scale the weight factor values around one) between two conditions,

WGSNCA = iji” — w?) (5)
i:l

We use this test statistic to test the hypothesis H0: WGSNCA = 0 against the
alternative H1: WGSNCA 7e 0. The P-values for the test statistic are obtained
by comparing the observed value of the test statistic to its null distribu-
tion, which is estimated using a permutation approach. We call this test
GSNCA. The GSNCA test is illustrated in Figure 1. We found that the
introduced weights are somewhat similar to the eigenvector centralities,
deﬁned for binary (adjacency) matrices.

The performance of GSNCA is compared with the performance of
GSCA (Choi and Kendziorski, 2009). Brieﬂy, GSCA works as follows.
For all p(p-1)/2 gene pairs, GSCA calculates correlations in the two bio-
logical conditions. The Euclidean distance, adjusted for the size of a gene
set is used as a test statistic,

 

DGSCA = —1 Wig/19(1) — 9(2))2 (6)
17(17 — 1)/2 k:1 k k

Here, k indexes the gene pairs within the gene set, and pg) denotes the
correlation of gene pair k in condition i. We would like to note that in this
context, the Euclidian distance is similar to the graph edit distance, fre-
quently used by methods aiming to detect the differential correlation
between pathways (Emmert-Streib, 2007). GSCA tests the hypothesis
H0: DGSCA = 0 against the alternative H1: DGSCA 7e 0.

all vertices in V and whose total length ELI-En d(v,-, vj) is minimal.
The second MST is deﬁned as the MST of the reduced graph G(V,
E-Tl). The union of the ﬁrst and second MST (denoted by MST2), con-
structed from using correlation distances, gives the minimal set of essen-
tial links (interactions) among genes, which we interpret as a network of
functional interactions. Each vertex in the MST2 has a minimum degree
of 2 if all the p(p-1)/2 pairwise correlations between genes are considered.
A gene that is highly correlated with all the other genes tends to occupy a
central position and has a relatively high degree in the MST2 because the
shortest paths connecting the vertices of the ﬁrst and second MSTs tend
to pass through this gene. In contrast, a gene with low intergene correl-
ations most likely occupies a non-central position in the MST2 and has a
degree of 2. The weight factors, inferred from GSNCA, correlate to some
extent with genes centralities in the MST2: genes with large weights are
placed near the center of the MST2, and genes with small weights are
placed on the periphery (see Section 3.2 for examples). Adopting network
terminology, a gene with the largest weight is a hub gene, coexpressed
with all the other genes in a pathway. In Section 3, we illustrate a coex-
pression analysis of gene sets with MST2 and discuss the interpretation of
hub genes. The MST2 for selected pathways of biological datasets are
provided in Supplementary Materials SI and S2.

2.3 Simulation setup

To evaluate the performance of GSNCA and GSCA in a fully controlled
setting, we designed simulation experiments that mimic real expression
data as close as possible. In a real biological setting, not all genes in a gene
set are coexpressed, and intergene correlations vary in strength.
Therefore, we introduced two parameters: y, the percentage of genes,
truly coexpressed in a gene set (detection call), and r, the strength of
intergene correlation. It is important to understand how exactly these
parameters inﬂuence the power of different tests.

Gene Sets Net Correlations Analysis

 

We simulated two samples of equal size, N/2 (N: 40) from
p-dimensional normal distributions N(0,21) and N(0,22), representing
two biological conditions with different outcome. We test the null hypoth-
esis H0: WGSNCA = 0, where wGSNCA is found from Equation (5). Two cases
were considered: the number of genes in a gene set (pathway) is relatively
small ([7 = 20) and relatively large (p = 100 and p = 200). To ensure that 21
and 22 are positive deﬁnite, two different scenarios were studied.

First, 21 was set to Ip><p and 22 was selected such that its elements are

r #1".th S 147
Uij = 0 i¢j.Vi.j>i/p
1 i=j.

For the y parameter, the proportion of genes truly coexpressed in a gene
set, we consider ye {0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}, and for the parameter r, control-
ling the strength of the intergene correlations we consider re {0.1, 0.2, . . . ,
0.9}. Figure 2a and b illustrate this setup for [7:20 and y=0.25 where
both correlation matrices under the alternative hypothesis are shown.
Dark and light colors represent high and low correlations, respectively.
This design presents a gene set with low intergene correlations in condi-
tion 1 (Fig. 2a) and one group of highly coexpressed genes in condition 2
(Fig. 2b). The purpose of the design is to demonstrate a fundamental
difference between GSCA and GSNCA. The power of GSCA is expected
to increase as r, as well as the size of the highly coexpressed group of
genes in condition 2 increase. Instead, the power of GSNCA is expected
to increase as the difference in intergene correlations between two condi-
tions increases. If all genes (y = 1) are highly coexpressed for condition 2,
the coexpression matrices in the two conditions are (R2 — I) = r(R1 — I).
The eigenvectors for both matrices are the same and GSNCA does not
detect changes regardless of the value of r. The maximum change in the
coexpression structure between condition 1 and 2 using this design occurs
when half of the genes (y=0.5) are highly coexpressed in condition 2.
That is, GSNCA should have the highest power when y: 0.5.

Second, for both 21 and 22 we form diagonal blocks of equal size [5]),
where ,8 is the ratio of block size to gene set size ([7). Then, for each block
separately the ﬁrst scenario is reproduced. Hence, each block will have yﬁp
genes with intergene correlation speciﬁed by r, whereas all the other genes
in the block have zero correlations. The locations of the 148p coexpressed
genes inside each block are assigned differently for 21 and 22 under al-
ternative hypothesis. Although for 21 these genes occupy the upper-left
corner of the block, for 22 they occupy the lower-right corner. Figure 2c
and (1 illustrates this setup for [7220, [520.25 and y=0.6 where both
correlation matrices under the alternative hypothesis are shown. Dark and
light colors represent high and low correlations, respectively. Depending
on y, the two alternate coexpressed gene groups in 21 and 22 may have a
few common genes (when y>0.5) or may be exclusive (when y50.5).
Figure 2c and (1 shows four common genes between highly coexpressed
gene groups. All intergene correlations outside the blocks are set to zero or
a small value. This design presents a gene set with low intergene correl-
ations except for selected groups of highly coexpressed genes. The mem-
bership of the genes in these groups is changing between the two
conditions with the possibility of having a few common members between
the two conditions (when y>0.5). Because the intergene correlation and
the structure of the coexpression matrix R vary between the two condi-
tions, both GSCA and GSNCA should detect changes.

2.4 Biological data

We illustrate the GSNCA approach using the NCI-60 cell lines (p53) and
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) datasets. The p53 dataset comprises
50 samples of NCI-60 cell lines differentiated based on the status of the
TP53 gene: 17 cell lines carrying normal (wild type, WT) TP53 gene and 33
cell lines carrying mutated TP53 (MUT) (Olivier et al., 2002; Subramanian
et al., 2005). For this dataset, probe level intensities were quantile normal-
ized and transformed to the log scale. The ALL dataset consists of micro-
arrays from 128 different individuals with acute lymphoblastic leukemia

(ALL). There are 95 samples with B-cell ALL (Chiaretti et al., 2004) and 33
with T-cell ALL (Chiaretti et al., 2005). Tumors carrying the BCR/ABL
mutation (37 samples) were compared to those with no cytogenetic
abnormalities (42 samples). To normalize samples, the robust multiarray
analysis procedure (Irizarry et al., 2003) was used.

The microarray platforms for the p53 and ALL datasets are, respect-
ively, hgu133plus2 and hgu95av2 with Affymetrix gene identiﬁers. Genes
without mapping to Entrez and Symbol identiﬁers were discarded. Probes
with duplicate identities were assessed and the probe with the largest
absolute value of t-statistic between two conditions was selected as a
gene match. Gene sets were taken from the C2 pathways set of the mo-
lecular signature database (MSigDB) (Liberzon et al., 2011; Subramanian
et al., 2005; Wu and Smyth, 2012) where a total of 3272 pathways are
present. Pathways with <15 or >500 genes were discarded and the
resulted dataset comprised 8806 genes and 2360 pathways to analyze.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Simulation study

3.1.] Type I error rate Table 1 presents the estimates of the
attained signiﬁcant levels for the GSCA and GSNCA tests (1000
independent simulations were used). As can be seen, the esti-
mates of Type I error rate when 21 = 22 = I under different par-
ameter settings for both tests are similar and rather conservative.

3.1.2 The power of tests to detect changes in correlation
structure Figure 3 presents power estimates under the first
simulation scenario (Section 2.3) for different parameter settings.
For each parameter setting, 1000 independent simulations were
used and the average (mean) power is shown.

First, consider the case when 25% of genes in a gene set are
coexpressed (y = 0.25). This is highly plausible for real expression
data, as not many genes in a gene set are highly coexpressed
(Montaner et al., 2009; Tripathi and Emmert—Streib, 2012). The
GSNCA shows higher power than GSCA for all settings (p = 20,
100, 200). Second, consider the case when 50% of genes in a gene
set are coexpressed (y = 0.5). Both tests show similar power when
the size of gene set is relatively small (p = 20). However, when the
size of gene set is relatively large (p: 100 and p=200) the
GSNCA outperforms the GSCA. Third, consider the case
when 75% of genes in a gene set are coexpressed (y=0.75).
GSCA outperforms GSNCA when the size of gene set is rela-
tively small (p = 20). However, their performance becomes similar
when the number of genes increases (p: 100, p=200). Fourth,
consider the case when 100% of genes in a gene set are coex-
pressed (y=1). This case illustrates a clear-cut difference in
performance between GSNCA and GSCA. GSNCA has the
highest power when y: 0.5 (see Section 2.3 for detail).

setup when the alternative hypothesis is true (N: 40)

Figure 4 presents power estimates under the second simulation
scenario (see Section 2.3) for different parameter settings. For all
simulations, we set )3: 0.25 and used y: {0.6, 0.4, 0.5} for
p: {20, 100, 200}, respectively. These simulation parameters
result in 3, 10 and 25 truly coexpressed genes for p=20, 100
and 200, respectively. The results show that GSCA outperforms
GSNCA when the size of the gene set is relatively small (p = 20).
When p is 100, an opposite trend is observed, and when p is further
increased to 200, GSNCA outperforms GSCA. It is also worth
noting that when the two alternate coexpressed gene groups in 21
and 22 are exclusive, the detection power of GSNCA increases as
all genes in both of these groups will show high net coexpression
change between two conditions. Common genes between these
groups will have the same net coexpression between the two
conditions.

To summarize the simulation results, GSNCA outperforms
GSCA when the size of gene set is relatively large and when
changes in coexpression non-uniformly affect pathway members.
GSCA performs the best when all genes in a pathway are differ-
entially coexpressed.

3.2 PS3 dataset

To study the tests performance, we categorized pathways into
three groups: detected exclusively by GSNCA, exclusively by
GSCA and by both. The number of pathways detected exclu-
sively by GSNCA, GSCA and both were, respectively, 130, 55
and 15. A complete list of these pathways is provided in
Supplementary Table S1.

Pathways found by GSCA and GSNCA approaches fall into
four major categories: (i) tumorigenesis, (ii) monogenic changes
in tumors, (iii) signaling pathways and (iv) changes in metabol-
ism. In turn, every category can be additionally subdivided into
two more specific categories: (i) tumor signatures and compara-
tive analysis of tumor signatures, (ii) fusions and single gene
targeting, (iii) response to anticancer treatment and general
system response and (iv) cellular and nucleic acid metabolisms
(Supplementary Table S2). GSCA approach ﬁnds more path-
ways, related to metabolism, whereas GSNCA preferentially de-
tects signaling pathwaysiresponse to anticancer treatment and
general system response. The biological context of differences
between pathways, found exclusively by GSNCA and GSCA
reﬂects the difference in null hypotheses, tested by these
approaches. GSCA tests the hypothesis that the averaged differ-
ence among all pairwise correlations is equal to zero, whereas
GSNCA tests that the difference between two weight vectors,
corresponding to genes net correlations, is equal to zero.

Cancer agents act on molecular targets related to p53 that are
frequently hub genes (see later in the text). Mutation in p53
causes changes in targets interactions with the rest of the path-
way and consequently changes in their weights, whereas overall
average correlation for a pathway may remain the same. Several
aspects of cellular metabolism are also affected by changes in p53
status: p53 has been shown to regulate TP53-induced glycolysis,
synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase and damage-regulated autop-
hagy (Jones and Thompson, 2009; Vousden and Ryan, 2009).
Thus, most metabolic networks should be affected by mutated
p53 indirectly, through reduced nutrient or energy levels, corres-
ponding to changes in average correlations between two
conditions.

Fig. 5. (a) The difference in average correlations and (b) the average
difference in weight factors between the two phenotypes detected by dif-
ferent approaches for p53 dataset

To illustrate the difference between GSCA and GSNCA
approaches quantitatively, for each set of pathways, detected
exclusively by GSNCA, exclusively by GSCA and by both, we
found (i) the average difference in weight factors between two
phenotypes, WT and MUT (average wGSNCA) and (ii) the differ-
ence in average correlations between two phenotypes (Fig. 5).
Pathways detected exclusively by GSNCA or by both tests
show higher differences in weight factors than pathways detected
exclusively by GSCA, whereas pathways detected exclusively by
GSCA show higher difference in average correlations (Fig. 5).
This observation is in agreement with our qualitative analysis of
biological differences between pathways, exclusively detected by
different approaches.

3.2.] Hub genes GSNCA identiﬁes hub genesigenes with the
largest weights in each pathway. Hub genes provide useful bio-
logical information beyond the test result that a pathway is dif-
ferentially coexpressed between two conditions. In what follows,
we discuss several examples of hubs functional roles in pathways
identified using GSNCA approach. MST2 of all signiﬁcant path-
ways for p53 data and hub genes with corresponding weights are
provided in Supplementary Material S1).

Major regulator. LU_TUMOR_VASCULATURE_UP (Fig. 6)
pathway comprises genes overexpressed in ovarian cancer endo-
thelium (Lu et al., 2007). In the original study, TNFAIP6 (tumor
necrosis factor, (Ir-induced protein 6) identiﬁed in our analysis as
hub gene (Fig. 6a) was 29.1-fold overexpressed in tumor endothe-
lium, and was suggested to be speciﬁc for ovarian cancer vascu-
lature (Lu et al., 2007). It indicates that TNFAIP6 can be an
important regulator of ovarian cancer, and its property of being
a hub enhances the original observation. When p53 is mutated
(Fig. 6b) hub gene is VCAN, containing p53 binding site. Its ex-
pression is highly correlated with p53 dosage Noon et al., 2002).
Thus, both hub genes provide adequate information about the
underlying biological processes. Interestingly, in this example
TNFAIP6 has the highest degree and betweenness centralities,
whereas VCAN does not (data not shown).

coexpression network. (a) MST2 for p53 WT, the hub gene is STAGl
and (b) MST2 for p53 MUT, the hub gene is CDK14

Another interesting example is YAO_HOXA10_TARGETS_
VIA_PROGESTERONE_DN pathway Wao et al., 2003). The
authors show that Hoxa-10 mediates proliferation of uterine
stromal cells in response to progesterone, and the pathway con-
sists of Hoxa-10 downregulated targets. GSNCA identiﬁes
Hoxa-10 as hub gene for those targets, in agreement with experi-
mental evidence Wao et al., 2003).

Specific regulator. Trabectedin (ET-743) induces a delay in S
phase and an arrest in G2/M phase in human cancer cells (Gajate
et al., 2002). GAJATE_RESPONSE_TO_TRABECTEDIN_
DN pathway (Fig. 7) presents genes, downregulated in response
to ET-743. For p53 wild type data, hub gene is STAGl (stromal
antigen 1, Fig. 7a) that encodes a component of cohesin, a multi-
subunit protein complex that provides sister chromatid cohesion
and has a speciﬁc function in cell division. When p53 is mutated
(Fig 7b), hub gene is CDK14 (cell division protein kinase 14) that
controls overall cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. In
this example, hub genes in both conditions also have highest
degree and betweenness centralities (data not shown). R package
igraph (version 0.6.5) was used for network Visualization.

The p53 target. p53 is a major tumor suppressor protein, and
44.4% of all pathways, found by GSNCA are related to tumori-
genesis (Supplementary Table S2). It is logical to assume that p53
and its targets (611 genes, www.genecards.org) should be en-
riched in these pathways. The p53 targets frequently occupy
hub positions in the case of p53 WT (hypergeometric test
P: 1.611 x 10‘s).

This demonstrates that the property of being hub correlates
with supposed biological function. It should be noted that hub

Fig. 8. (a) The difference in average correlations and (b) the average
difference in weight factors between the two phenotypes detected by dif-
ferent approaches for ALL dataset

genes in pathways detected exclusively by GSCA showed no
signiﬁcant enrichment (P: 0.095) in p53 targets.

Overall, the analysis of hub genes provides biologically rele-
vant information about their role in the underlying processes: it
highlights genes, major and speciﬁc pathways regulators and also
genes that are affected by global difference between two condi-
tions, in this case by mutation in p53 gene. Thus, hub genes can
help identify new biomarkers of tumor progression, metastasis
and other markers of major phenotypic changes.

3.3 ALL dataset

For the ALL dataset, the number of pathways detected exclu-
sively by GSNCA, GSCA and both were, respectively, 59, 162
and 27. Pathways detected exclusively by GSNCA or by both
tests again show higher differences in the weight factors than
the pathways detected exclusively by GSCA; differences in the
average correlations among the three groups of pathways are less
pronounced than in the case of p53 data (Fig. 8). A complete list
of these pathways with their corresponding GSNCA and GSCA
P—Values is provided in Supplementary Table S3. MST2 of all
signiﬁcant pathways for ALL data and hub genes with corres-
ponding weights are provided in Supplementary Material S2.

Next, we selected BCR/ABL—related genes (350 genes, www.
genecards.org) and examined the KEGG_CHRONIC_
MYELOID_LEUKEMIA pathway, known to be speciﬁcally
associated with the BCR/ABL mutation. This pathway has 28
BCR/ABL-related genes (out of 70 genes), resulting in signiﬁ-
cant enrichment (hypergeometric test P=3.585 x 10‘21,
Supplementary Table S3). KEGG_CHRONIC_MYELOID_
LEUKEMIA was detected exclusively by GSNCA with high
signiﬁcance (P:0.005). Although GSCA detects pathways
with signiﬁcant differences in correlations, it failed to detect
this pathway (P: 0.219).

From the analysis of both datasets, we conclude that changes
in net correlations, overlooked by tests measuring average

correlation changes, are important and point toward pathways
that are crucially involved in phenotypic changes between two
conditions.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we proposed a new multivariate statistical test,
GSNCA that detects signiﬁcant changes in the coexpression
structure between two different biological conditions. This rep-
resents a major improvement over earlier approaches that com-
pare averaged pairwise correlations, or other pairwise measures
of coexpression, because our approach is able to detect changes
previous approaches would miss. This strength of GSNCA stems
from including all cross-correlations of a single gene. In this way,
GSNCA is accounting for the multivariate structure of the data.

The analyses of the p53 and the ALL datasets confirmed that
the principal difference between GSNCA and GSCA is in the
ability of the former test to detect pathways with changes in the
net correlation structure. For the p53 data set, GSNCA prefer-
entially detects signaling pathwaysiresponse to anticancer treat-
ment and general system response, whereas GSCA finds more
pathways related to metabolism. Anticancer treatments fre-
quently involve cancer agents that act on molecular targets
such as p53 and p53-related genes. In agreement, GSNCA pref-
erentially identifies pathways with p53-related hub genes (see
later in the text) in one phenotype, but not the other, reﬂecting
net correlation changes caused by differences in the p53 status. In
turn, GSCA preferentially identiﬁes pathways with averaged cor-
relation changes, as we would expect for metabolic pathways
affected by p53 status through homeostatic regulation of
energy and amino acids metabolisms. Pathways detected exclu-
sively by GSNCA show higher differences in weight factors than
pathways detected exclusively by GSCA, whereas pathways
detected exclusively by GSCA show higher differences in the
average correlations (Fig. 5). For the ALL dataset the difference
between pathways, identiﬁed by GSCA and GSNCA is
explained similarly (Fig. 8).

GSNCA has an interesting property that we discuss in more
detail here. The accurate reconstruction of gene networks from
experimental data is considered a major goal of systems biology
(Stolovitzky et al., 2007). Depending on the biological context of
the problem, there are many approaches available (Emmert-
Streib et al., 2012), and the most commonly used methods are
based on correlation measures (Zhang and Horvath, 2005), in-
formation-theoretic approaches (Faith et al., 2007; Margolin
et al., 2006; Meyer et al., 2007) and probabilistic graphical
models (Friedman, 2004; Friedman et al., 2000). Our approach
does not infer coexpression networks but uses the structure of the
full coexpression network encoded in its correlation matrix to
approximately identify changes in coexpression networks be-
tween two conditions. Thus, GSNCA actually avoids the prob-
lem of network inference and gets directly to the question that
usually motivates the network inferenceiwhat are the differ-
ences in coexpression networks. Because the network inference
step can be computational intense and method-dependent, this
can be a useful property when the research question is the
difference between coexpression networks.

Furthermore, we introduced a new way to Visualize coexpres-
sion networks with all correlations present, using the union of the

ﬁrst and second MST2. MST2 is constructed using correlation
distance and by construction, genes in the center of the MST2
have large weights. The analysis of the p53 data suggests that
genes with large weightsihub genesihave interesting biological
properties. The hubs frequently correspond to pathway regula-
tors, and in many cases a functional difference between hub
genes in two conditions reﬂects the global change underlying
the different phenotypes. Actually it is expected, as hub genes
with large weights may have high degree and betweenness cen-
tralities that are considered to be frequent indicators of genes
importance (Gu et al., 2012). Interestingly, the degree and
betweenness centralities were the highest for hub genes for
both conditions in one example (Fig. 7) but correlated with
high weight of hub gene in just one condition in another example
(Fig. 6). In practice, it means that the suggested weights some-
times correlate with the centrality measures, but generally char-
acterize node importance differently. Thus, hub genes identiﬁed
by GSNCA can be interesting candidates for further biological
studies because, depending on the study, they may represent
regulators of tumor progression, drug targets or critical pathway
switches.

In sum, we presented a novel approach that characterizes dif-
ferences in coexpression networks, without requiring the network
inference step. In general, GSCNA should be a valuable addition
to GSA approaches because (i) it identiﬁes differentially coex-
pressed pathways that are overlooked otherwise, (ii) eigenvectors
are computed efﬁciently and (iii) it provides information about
the importance of genes in pathways that may result in new
biological hypotheses.

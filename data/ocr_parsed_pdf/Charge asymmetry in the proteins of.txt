ABSTRACT

Motivation: Outer membrane beta-barrels (OMBBs) are the proteins
found in the outer membrane of bacteria, mitochondria and chloro-
plasts. There are thousands of beta-barrels reported in genomic data-
bases with ~2—3% of the genes in gram-negative bacteria encoding
these proteins. These proteins have a wide variety of biological func-
tions including active and passive transport, cell adhesion, catalysis
and structural anchoring. Of the non-redundant OMBB structures in
the Protein Data Bank, half have been solved during the past 5 years.
This influx of information provides new opportunities for understanding
the chemistry of these proteins. The distribution of charges in proteins
in the outer membrane has implications for how the mechanism of
outer membrane protein insertion is understood. Understanding the
distribution of charges might also assist in organism selection for
the heterologous expression of mitochondrial OMBBs.

Results: We find a strong asymmetry in the charge distribution of
these proteins. For the outward-facing residues of the beta-barrel
within regions of similar amino acid density for both membrane leaf-
lets, the external side of the outer membrane contains almost three
times the number of charged residues as the internal side of the outer
membrane. Moreover, the lipid bilayer of the outer membrane is asym-
metric, and the overall preference for amino acid types to be in the
external leaflet of the membrane correlates roughly with the hydropho-
bicity of the membrane lipids. This preference is demonstrably related
to the difference in lipid composition of the external and internal leaf-
lets of the membrane.

1 INTRODUCTION

The proteins of the outer membrane make up 273% of gram-
negative bacteria proteome (Martelli et al., 2002; Wimley, 2002;
Zhai and Saier, 2002). These proteins are responsible for trans-
port, cell surface enzymatic functions and structural anchoring
(W imley, 2003). Quter membrane beta-barrels (OMBBs) of bac-
teria are remotely homologous to the OMBBs of mitochondria
(Jimenez-Morales and Liang, 2011). The structure of outer mem-
brane proteins are almost exclusively antiparallel beta-barrels
(Fig. 1a).

Outer membrane proteins are more hydrophilic than inner
membrane proteins. Inner membrane proteins, which are mostly
multipass transmembrane helical bundles, have lipid-facing

exteriors that are extremely hydrophobic and protein-facing in-
teriors that are similarly hydrophobic to the hydrophobic cores of
soluble proteins (Rees et al., 1989; Rees and Eisenberg, 2000). The
structures of OMBBs, on the other hand, are such that they are
more like inside-out soluble proteins. The lipid-facing exterior is
highly hydrophobic, but the interior is often accessible to water
and is composed of small hydrophilic residues (Wimley, 2002).

The study of the lipid-facing positions of OMBBs is of par-
ticular interest as it may lead to a clearer understanding of the
folding mechanism of OMBBs. OMBBs have long been known
to spontaneously insert into lipid vesicles (Surrey and Jahnig,
1992). In vivo, protein insertion cannot occur without the
B-Barrel Assembly Machinery (BAM). It has been hypothesized
that OMBBs can insert by themselves in vivo but that the kinetics
are too slow to allow for the insertion to occur at the speed and
frequency necessary for OMBBs to promote cell Viability (Tamm
et al., 2004).

Previous studies on the folding of OMBBs have used symmet-
ric lipid vesicles or computational models that make the outer
membrane a symmetric lipid bilayer. Reconstitution of mutated
outer membrane phospholipase in lipid bilayer vesicles demon-
strated that substitution of leucine for native residues in lipid-
facing positions stabilizes OMBBs and substitution of those same
positions to arginine destabilizes OMBBs. The effect of these
mutations on stabilization is stronger toward the center of the
vesicle bilayer and is less pronounced closer to the aqueous inter-
face (Moon and Fleming, 2011).

Previous bioinformatic assessment of lipid-facing OMBB
amino acid composition was accomplished by symmetrizing the
outer membrane such that the center of the membrane was
deﬁned as z = 0; 1A in either the internal direction or the ex-
ternal direction was defined as z = 1. By symmetrizing the mem-
brane, the authors could double the counts for their study and
provide a statistically signiﬁcant picture of the preferences of all
20 amino acids for each 1.5A segment of the membrane.
Aliphatic amino acids were shown to prefer the interior of the
membrane, polar and charged amino acids were shown to prefer
the exterior of the membrane and aromatics were shown to
prefer the interfacial region (Hsieh et al., 2012). These results
are similar to earlier studies of inner membrane amino acid pref-
erences (Senes et al., 2007).

More recent asymmetric assessment of inner membrane alpha
helical proteins (Schramm et al., 2012) demonstrated the posi-
tive-inside rule (von Heijne and Gavel, 1988) in the symmetric
inner membrane, as arginine and lysine have a strong propensity
for localizing on the cytoplasmic-facing loops of the inner mem-
brane. This positive-inside rule determines the topology of inner
membrane proteins and is believed to be a result of at least three
factors: the voltage across the inner membrane (Andersson and

Fig. 1. Charged residues prefer the external side of beta-barrels. (a) Four
OMBBs with roughly average numbers of external-half charged residues
per strand are shown in gray. The strands of the barrel are shown as with
sheet secondary structure and the rest of the protein as loops. Ome
(PDBID 1QJ8) is an 8-stranded OMBB; Porin (PDBID 2POR) is a
16-stranded OMBB; LamB (PDBID 1AF6) is an 18-stranded OMBB;
BtuB (PDBID 2GUF) is a 22-stranded OMBB. Outward-facing charged
residues in the barrel are colored, glutamate and aspartate are red, lysine
and arginine are blue. Proteins drawn using pymol (http://wwwpymol.

charges among the OMBB proteins studied herein. The numbers of exter-
nal-half outward-facing charged residues in the barrel per strand of the
barrel are shown. Bins are inclusive of the bin minimum. (c) External
region preference by amino acid. A preference score based on the frequency
of occurrence in the external versus the internal region of the outer mem-
brane is calculated for each amino acid. Red amino acids are charged,
yellow are polar and green are aliphatic. The more hydrophilic an amino
acid is the more it prefers the external side of the outer membrane

von Heijne, 1994), the charges in the Sec translocon (Goder
et al., 2004) and the presence of negatively charged phospholipids
(van Klompenburg et al., 1997; Xie et al., 2006).

Of these factors, the only one to be relevant to the outer mem-
brane is that of voltage across the membrane. The outer mem-
brane is known to have an electrical potential of similar
magnitude and direction as the electrical potential across the
inner membrane (Sen et al., 1988; Stock et al., 1977). However,
of the other two factors, one is not present, and one is lessened.
Outer membrane proteins are inserted into the membrane using
the unrelated BAM machinery rather than the Sec translocon.
Moreover, although the inner membrane and the outer mem-
brane are composed of the same phospholipids [phosphatidy-
lethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin],
there is evidence that the percentage of negatively charged
phospholipids is one-half to one-quarter of that in the inner mem-
brane (Osborn et al., 1972).

The outer membrane itself is highly asymmetric with an inner
leaﬂet of phospholipid and an outer leaﬂet of lipopolysacchar-
ides (LPS) (Kamio and Nikaido, 1976). It has been determined
that a group of proteins coordinates the maintenance of this lipid
asymmetry (Malinvemi and Silhavy, 2009). Moving charges in

the loops of OMBBs does not change their topology (Koebnik,
1999), and previous analysis has indicated that there is a prefer-
ence for positive charges on the lipid-facing external region of
OMBBs but no difference in the prevalence of negatively charged
amino acids between the lipid-facing internal and external
regions of the outer membrane (J ackups and Liang, 2005).

Since then, the number of non-homologous crystal structures
has more than doubled (http://blanco.biomol.uci.edu/Mem
brane_Proteins_xtal.html). In this work, we determine that
charged and polar amino acids are disproportionately favored
in the external side of the outer membrane. The localization of
the charged amino acids correlates well with the structure of the
lipids of the outer membrane, to the extent that differences in
lipids between organisms are correlated with a difference in lo-
calizations of charges in those organisms. The description herein
of OMBBs’ asymmetry with respect to all charged amino acids,
not just positive charge, demonstrates the importance of the
asymmetry of the outer membrane itself with respect to under-
standing the stability and insertion of OMBBs.

2 METHODS

2.1 Database construction

Fifty-ﬁve protein structures of OMBBs were used (Supplementary Table
S1) with a homology 550%. A maximum number of structures were
generated by searching through PDBfam (Xu and Dunbrack, 2012)
using the Pfam (Finn et al., 2010) clan code CL0193 as well as the
Pfam family codes PF07017 and PF11924. Reﬁnement of the dataset
by homology cutoff of 50% and resolution of 3.5A was determined
using PISCES (Wang and Dunbrack, 2003). PISCES selected the struc-
tures of highest resolution with no two sequences at >50% sequence
identity. For the ﬁnal dataset, some structure substitutions and omissions
were made based on mutations, length of protein resolved, topology,
organism or publication status (Supplemental Information).

2.2 Barrel determination

2.2.] Strand determination To better reﬂect the characteristics of the
beta-barrel, we wanted to include all residues that would conform to be
within a barrel even if there is a break of a few residues in the hydrogen-
bonding pattern. Because this deﬁnition is more expansive than that of
DSSP or other secondary structure assignment algorithms, a method for
strand determination was implemented as follows. For each structure,
hydrogens were generated for backbone nitrogens. Strands were deter-
mined by a distance of 52.75A between generated hydrogens and back-
bone oxygens. A residue was assigned to a strand if the residue’s amino
hydrogen was within hydrogen-bonding distance of another residue’s
carbonyl oxygen (or vice versa) and if either the hydrogen donor or the
hydrogen acceptor had a B-sheet like (p and \u (if (p < —100° and \u <
—100° or \u > 50°; or if (p > 150° and \u < —50° or \u > 100°). To
maximize continuous strands, strand identity was then conferred based
on sequence proximity to other strand-belonging residues and based on
whether the strands formed a circular barrel structure. Circularity was
resolved based on ensuring that each strand had at least one hydrogen-
bonding partner in both the previous and subsequent strand.

2.2.2 Inward/ outward Once the strands are identiﬁed, the barrel axis
is determined. First, two best-ﬁt ellipses are identiﬁed using the positions
of the Car atoms at the topmost and bottommost amino acids for each
strand. The vector between the centroid of the two ellipses is then deﬁned
as the barrel axis. An amino acid’s directional vector was deﬁned as the
direction from the midpoint of its amino nitrogen and its carbonyl carbon

to its carbon alpha. If the angle between the barrel axis and this direc-
tional vector was <90°, the residue was considered to be facing inward,
otherwise it was deﬁned as outward-facing.

2.2.3 Z oﬂfwt The internal and external sides were identiﬁed using the
previously determined rule that both the N and C termini of OMBBs are
internal (Schulz, 2002).The barrel axis was then used to create a rotation
matrix so that the barrel could be rotated such that the barrel axis was on
the z-axis. The midpoint of the membrane (z = 0) was deﬁned as the
location at which the phospholipid layer meets the LPS layer. The barrel
is then translated so that the centroid of the bottom ellipse is at —12A.
This z offset was determined through assessment of the placement of the
outward-facing aromatic residues. Tryptophans and tyrosines are known
to prefer the interfacial region of OMBBs (Wimley, 2002) and to stabilize
the structures when they are located in that region (Hong et al., 2007). At
a z offset of —12A, the outward-facing aromatic residues were well dis-
tributed at the interfacial region with a peak at —9A%orresponding to
previous calculations (Hsieh et al., 2012) and corresponding to the loca-
tion of the interfacial region of the membrane as has been previously
modeled (Shroll and Straatsma, 2002).

2.3 Error calculation and signiﬁcance tests

As described below, S is a score of how much an amino acid prefers the
external region of the membrane over the internal region of the mem-
brane. Signiﬁcance for the S score was assessed by a binomial test where
the null hypothesis was that the share of each amino acid on each side of
z=0 was the same as the total share of amino acids on that side. Only
amino acids where the signiﬁcance of the amino acid distribution on both
sides was better than 5% were used for comparison to the water-octanol
hydrophobicity scale or the outer membrane insertion scale
(Supplementary Figs S1 and S2).

Pearson’s chi-squared test was used for assessing the signiﬁcance of the
curve for each amino acid proportion distribution across the z-axis of the
membrane (Fig. 2). The null hypothesis was that each amino acid should
be equally distributed across the z-axis. All amino acids shown were
better than 5% signiﬁcance.

Standard error measurements were calculated for average hydropho-
bicity (Figs 3 and 4) as the square root of the bin variance weighted by the
count of each amino acid in that bin divided by the square root of the
total counts in that bin.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Charge outside rule

We compared each amino acid type’s occurrence in the external
region of the membrane (z > 0) with its occurrence at the internal
region of the membrane (z < 0). A11 non-loop outward-facing
residues with a Ca position of |z| 5 12A were used. The :l:12A
cutoff was set because the bottom centroid was placed at —12A
(methods) and thus the density of amino acids in the membrane
falls off dramatically below that point. This range of z is fully
buried within the membrane and does not consider regions of
the proteins outside the membrane itself. The locations of 3901
amino acids were surveyedil937 internal and 1964 external.

To quantify an amino acid’s preference for the external or
internal region of the membrane, a preference score was
calculated.

Positive score values indicate preference for the internal region
and negative score values indicate preference for the external
region of the membrane. The results demonstrate that polar resi-
dues, and in particular charged residues, strongly prefer the ex-
ternal half of the membrane (Fig. 1c). Glutamic acid is the most
enriched amino acid in the external region of the membrane fol-
lowed by arginine and lysine, and then glutamine, asparagine
and aspartic acid. The aliphatic residues show a mild preference
for the internal region. This progression of preference for all 20
amino acid types correlates roughly with hydrophobicity.

The calculated score can be compared with other hydropho-
bicity scales. For the 10 amino acids whose preference for the
external region are signiﬁcant at 5% or better (see Methods), S
correlates well with a water-to-octanol hydrophobicity scale
(Wimley et al., 1996) (R2 = 0.58) (Supplementary Fig. S1) and
correlates even better with the whole-protein OMBB hydropho-
bicity scale (Moon and Fleming, 2011) (R2 = 0.86)
(Supplementary Fig. S2 with the removal of the two basic resi-
dues). Thus the more hydrophilic an amino acid the more its

presence is enriched in the external region of the outer
membrane.

3.2 Charges distributed asymmetrically

To get a finer-grained understanding of amino acid preference in
the membrane, we divided the membrane beyond the two bins of
external side and internal side of the membrane. By dividing each
amino acid into 9 bins of 3A each, a more subtle picture of
amino acid preference emerges (Fig. 2).

Charged amino acids increase strongly the further they get into
the external region of the membrane (Fig. 2a). Polar amino acids
also increase on the external side but not as dramatically as the
charged amino acids. Of the polar amino acids, serine’s distribu-
tion is more symmetric between the internal region and the ex-
ternal region than the others (Fig. 2b) consistent with it being less
polar. Aliphatics prefer the internal region and the center of the
membrane with alanine preferring the center of the membrane
somewhat more than the others and leucine having a stronger
preference for the internal region than the other aliphatic amino
acids (Fig. 2c). Aromatic amino acids prefer the interfacial re-
gions and so the distribution of the aromatic amino acids is
shaped like an upside-down ‘w’ (Fig. 2d). Consistent with the
differences in their hydrophobicity, tryptophan prefers the exter-
nal region slightly more than the others and phenylalanine pre-
fers the external region slightly less. Because of fewer counts and
more uniform distribution, the distribution of Cys, Pro, Met and
Thr were not significant to 5% (see Methods) and are therefore
not shown. A 3A bin size was chosen such that all other amino
acids distributions would be signiﬁcant at 5%.

3.3 The charge distribution correlates well with membrane
structure

A clearer picture of the charge asymmetry emerges by comparing
the average amino acid hydrophobicity to the outer membrane
structure. The outer membrane of bacterial cells is highly asym-
metric. The inner half of the bilayer is composed of phospholipid
and the outer layer of the bilayer is composed of LPS. The LPS is
composed of lipid A and a core region of monosaccharides, and
in ‘smooth LPS’, a third region called the O-region, which is
composed of repeating groups of monosaccharides. Generally
speaking, lipid A is composed of two glucosamine units, each
with a phosphate group. Around six acyl chains are attached to
these two carbohydrates (Caroff and Karibian, 2003) (Fig. 4b
and c).The structure of all three components of the LPS varies
from organism to organism and even within an organism
depending on the organism’s environment.

A molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of an outer mem-
brane bilayer was undertaken by Shroll and Straatsma (2002).
In this simulation, the phospholipid PE was used for the inner
leaﬂet of the bilayer and for the outer leaﬂet, an LPS that is
similar in structure to the rough LPS of Pseudomonas aerugi—
nosaithough with slightly shorter and differently branched
acyl chains on the lipid A (Nikaido, 2003) (Fig. 3b). Overall,
the length of the acyl chain of the phospholipid tends to be
longer than the acyl chain of lipid A. Pseudomonas aeruginosa’s
lipid A is among the shortest of bacterial lipids and yet the region
of phospholipid alone is small. As demonstrated by the simula-
tion, because of its bulk, lipid A tends to pack less well than the

phosopholipid bilayer, and the acyl chains of the phospholipid
thus intercalate into the LPS layer.

The average hydrophobicity by membrane depth of the beta-
barrel amino acids was compared with the previously solved
outer membrane structure (Shroll and Straatsma, 2002).
Average hydrophobicity of all outward-facing barrel amino
acids was calculated for every 2A bin from a membrane depth
of — 16A to +44  Bins of 2A could be used in this case because
of the greater number of counts produced by combining all 20
amino acids. The hydrophobicity of each amino acid in each bin
was assigned using the water-to-octanol hydrophobicity scale
(Wimley et al., 1996). Standard errors were calculated and are
shown in Figure 3a.

A comparison of the structure of the simulated membrane and
the average hydrophobicity at each point in the membrane indi-
cates a structural explanation for the amino acid charge asym-
metry. Although the LPS layer is in general thicker than the
phospholipid layer, the MD simulation demonstrates that cal-
cium ions intercalate deeply into the LPS, interdigitating with the
headgroups of lipid A. The localization of this ion intercalation
was later demonstrated experimentally (Schneck, et al., 2010).
The intercalation seems to happen because of the phosphates
in the lipid A glucosamines. The presence of charged phosphates
and calcium ions in the region of z = 15 to 30A in the membrane
strongly suggests that the presence of charged and polar amino
acids at that depth stabilize the structure in that particular orien-
tation in the membrane. Indeed, it has been previously shown
that positively charged residues in that region create lipid A
binding sites (Ferguson et al., 2000).

3.4 Average hydrophobicity varies by membrane structure

The available membrane protein structures were then analyzed
by organism to identify differences between outer leaﬂet charge
content of beta-barrels. The average hydrophobicity by mem-
brane depth was calculated separately for the 17 Escherichia
coli monomer structures and the 12 P.aeruginosa monomer struc-
tures (Fig. 4a). For each of these two organisms, the average
hydrophobicity by membrane depth of the outward-facing
beta-barrel amino acids was calculated for every 2A from a
membrane depth of —16A to +18 The results are shown in
Figure 4a. The data for the two organisms were also ﬁt using a
local polynomial with a bandwidth of 2A. These regressions
show similar results. There is a difference in the hydrophobicity
with the introduction of different lipid As. The major drop in
hydrophobicity for P.aeruginosa barrels occurs at bin 1&12A,
while for Ecoli barrels the major drop is at the 1244A bin, a
difference of ~2A.

This large decrease in hydrophobicity was shown in Figure 3a
to correspond to the free hydroxyl region of the lipid A’s acyl
chains and the lipid A glucosamines, the most hydrophilic region
of the LPS leaﬂet of the bilayer. Thus a 2-A difference in its
location is likely related to structural differences between the
lipid A of E.coli and P.aerugin0sa. Indeed, the lipid A of
P.aeruginosa (Kulshin et al., 1991) is 2 carbons shorter than
the lipid A of E.coli (Raetz, 1990) as shown in Figure 4b.
Thus, the P.aeruginosa lipid A glucosamines are likely at a
lower z value than that of the Ecoli lipid A glucosamines.
Another contributing factor to this difference in average

hydrophobicity proﬁles is that the lipid A of P.aeruginosa con-
tains more, free hydroxyl groups than the lipid A of E.coli. The
increase of free hydroxyl groups would increase the polarity of
the local environment, thus correlating with lower hydrophobi-
city. This is precisely what is seen in the lower hydrophobicity
values for P.aeruginosa over E. coli in the top region of the lipid A
acyl chain. It is important to note that the difference is not likely
due to differences in barrel length between E.c0[i and
P.aerugin0sa. There is little difference between the average
barrel axis length of the P.aeruginosa barrels (33.5 A) and the
Ecoli barrels (34.6A).

4 DISCUSSION

There is a signiﬁcant asymmetry in the distribution of outward-
facing charged and polar amino acids in OMBBs. Charged
amino acids are strongly preferred in the external-membrane
side of OMBBs and are much more rarely found on the internal
side (Fig. 1). The preference of amino acid types by location
within the membrane correlates well with previously determined
hydrophobicity scales (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). These
preferences may be useful for OMBB structure prediction,
which is evolving away from template-based models (Randall
et al., 2008) and moving more toward knowledge-based potential
functions (Naveed et al., 2011) and structure predictors that use
an explicit z-potential (Hayat and Elofsson, 2012).

The asymmetric charge distribution is correlated with the
asymmetric structure of the outer membrane. Low hydrophobi-
cites are seen at the outermost edge of the internal region where
the phospholipid head group is situated. The hydrophobicity in-
creases and then plateaus where the fatty acyl chains of the
phospholipid group interdigitate with the fatty acyl chains of
lipid A of the outer leaﬂet. The hydrophobicity then drops pre-
cipitously at the free hydroxyl region of the acyl chains of lipid A
and reaches a minimum at the site of the phosphatidyl glucosa-
mines of lipid A. The average hydrophobicity then rises slightly
in the saccharide region of the LPS outer leaﬂet becoming less
hydrophobic as it gets closer to the water interface (Fig. 3).

The differences in outer membranes among organisms are re-
ﬂected in the distribution of the hydrophobicity of their amino
acids. The only two organisms for which there is currently
enough structural data to produce statistically significant re-
sults are P.aeruginosa and E.coli. When comparing the average
hydrophobicities of the two, the most notable difference is at z
in the range of 1&12. In this location of the membrane, the
average hydrophobicities of the two organisms sharply diverge.
The E. coli hydrophobicity is still in line with the hydrophobicities
in the fatty acyl chain region, whereas the P.aeruginosa
hydrophobicity is indicative of the free hydroxyl/glucosamine
region of lipid A. This difference and the subsequent slightly
lower hydrophobicities of P.aeruginosa are consistent with the
structural differences of the membrane in these two organisms in
precisely those regions. The lipid A of P.aeruginosa is both
shorter and more polar than the lipid A of E.coli. Thus the
change in hydrophobicity would be predicted to occur at a
lower z value, and then the subsequent hydrophobicities in that
region would continue to be slightly lower as is consistent with
the structure of the LPS and the hydrophobicities corresponding
to it (Fig. 3).

Charge asymmetry of outer membrane proteins

 

The observation that differences in the structure of an organ-
ism’s lipid A is manifested in the amino acid composition of its
OMBBs could be useful for heterologous expression of recom-
binant mammalian mitochondrial OMBB proteins. To date only
one mitochondrial OMBB’s structure has been solved
(Bayrhuber et al., 2008; ijal et al., 2008). A major bottleneck
to membrane protein characterization is overexpression, which
can sometimes be overcome by careful selection of an appropri-
ate heterologous expression system (Bernaudat et al., 2011; Tate,
2001). Stabilization of mitochondrial OMBBs might be accom-
plished by expression in organisms with lipid A structures that
are more similar to the mitochondrial outer membrane external
leaﬂetiie. a lipid A that is more similar to a phospholipid.
Alternatively, stabilization might be achieved by mutating se-
lected outward-facing residues of the desired mammalian protein
at critical z positions that correspond with the phosphate loca-
tions in lipid A of the desired host. Thus mitochondrial proteins
might be more easily expressed in prokaryotic membranes and
greater structural knowledge of mitochondrial proteins might be
ascertained.

Spontaneous insertion of OMBBs both in vivo and in vitro
should be reexamined in light of the demonstrated charge asym-
metry of OMBBs. It seems unlikely that the highly charged part
of the protein that is bound for the external region of the mem-
brane in vivo passes all the way through the lipid bilayer of
vesicles. Although the exact energetic cost is unclear, certainly
the high energetic cost of temporarily stripping waters from the
polar region and burying charges in a hydrophobic environment
would be unnecessarily high. Theoretical calculations of moving
even a single protonated arginine from water to a membrane
environment have estimated the cost at 38 kcal/mol (Honig and
Hubbell, 1984). More recent MD simulations have suggested
that in the inner membrane an arginine attached to a helix
would cost 17kca1/mol (Dorairaj and Allen, 2007), whereas ex-
periments using the translocon machinery suggest the cost is
2.5 kcal/mol (Hessa et al., 2005). Even with the most conservative
estimate, with an average of one external charged residue per
strand for OMBBs (Fig. 1b) and a minimum of eight strands,
this sums to a minimum of 820 kcal/mol.

However, OMBBs can still insert into vesicles in a manner that
allows them to have a native foldibackward, with the hydro-
phobic end ﬁrst. Inserting backward from the outside of the
vesicle would allow the OMBBs to be topologically identical to
how OMBBs are inserted into the cellular outer membrane from
the inside, with the charged end facing outward with respect to
the vesicle and the less charged end facing inward.

Spontaneous insertion of OMBBs into vesicles has been
demonstrated for at least 11 OMBBs (Burgess et al., 2008;
Mahalakshmi et al., 2007; Pocanschi et al., 2006;
Shanmugavadivu et al., 2007; Surrey and Jahnig, 1992; Surrey
et al., 1996) under a large variety of conditionsiincluding dif-
ferences in vesicle composition, temperature and pH. However,
the forward insertion mechanism is the only directional mechan-
ism that has been demonstrated for outer membrane protein in-
sertion into vesicles (Kleinschmidt et al., 1999; Kleinschmidt and
Tamm, 1999). This mechanism was established using time-
dependent ﬂuorescence quenching of tryptophan. It is notable
that this mechanism was demonstrated for the OMBB outer
membrane protein A (OmpA), which has a large periplasmic

domain that might encourage forward insertion. It is also notable
that OmpA has only 5 external-region outward-facing charged
residues in its barrel (0.625 per strand) compared with the aver-
age OMBB, which has 17 similarly located charged residues (1
per strand) (Fig. 1b). Thus OmpA’s mechanism might be an
anomaly as a result of an easier forward insertion mechanism
owing to less charge hindrance. Moreover, when comparing
spontaneous OMBB insertion in vesicles, each protein preferred
a different lipid composition, temperature and pH (most of
which were non-physiological) (Burgess et al., 2008), possibly
supporting a heterogeneity of in vitro insertion mechanism.

In contrast to the vesicle experiments, OMBBs cannot insert
spontaneously in vivo. This is perhaps because the charged region
would have to pass through the entire outer membrane to be
oriented correctly. In light of this, the BAM complex might
not only speed up insertion, as has previously been posited,
but likely also has a mechanism to shield the charged region
from the apolar region of the outer membrane. Many proposed
mechanisms (Kim et al., 2012) do not take into account this
necessary function of the BAM complex and will need to be
reexamined in light of the extreme charge asymmetry.

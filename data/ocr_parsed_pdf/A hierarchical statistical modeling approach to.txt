ABSTRACT

Motivation: Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)
is a widely used method in quantitative proteomics. A robust data ana-
lysis strategy is required to determine protein quantification reliability,
i.e. changes due to biological regulation rather than technical variation,
so that proteins that are differentially expressed can be identified.
Methods: Samples were created by mixing 5, 10, 15 and 20 pg
Escherichia coli cell lysate with 100 pg of cell lysate from mouse,
corresponding to expected relative fold changes of one for mouse
proteins and from 0.25 to 4 for Eco/i proteins. Relative quantification
was carried out using eight channel isobaric tagging with iTRAQ
reagent, and proteins were identified using a TripleTOF 5600 mass
spectrometer. Technical variation inherent in this iTRAQ dataset was
systematically investigated.

Results: A hierarchical statistical model was developed to use quan-
titative information at peptide level and protein level simultaneously to
estimate variation present in each individual peptide and protein.
A novel data analysis strategy for iTRAQ, denoted in short as
WHATraq, was subsequently proposed with its performance evalu-
ated by the proportion of Eco/i proteins that are successfully identified
as differentially expressed. Compared with two benchmark data ana-
lysis strategies WHATraq was able to identify at least 62.8% more true
positive proteins that are differentially expressed. Further validated
using a biological iTRAQ dataset including multiple biological repli-
cates from varied murine cell lines, WHATraq performed consistently
and identified 375% more proteins as being differentially expressed
among different cell lines than the other data analysis strategies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the past decade, mass spectrometry (MS) has become the
method of choice for large-scale proteomics research to identify
and quantify proteins present in different biological contexts

(Domon and Aebersold, 2006; Gingras et al., 2007). Several tech-
niques including isotopic labeling and label-free methods have
been developed in association with MS to monitor quantitative
changes in protein expression and post-translational modifica-
tion states (Gygi et al., 1999; Ong et al., 2002; Ross et al.,
2004; Thompson et al., 2003). The isobaric tag for relative and
absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) approach is particularly of inter-
est among isotopic labeling methods due to its ability to analyze
in vivo samples and to compare up to eight samples simultan-
eously (Ross et al., 2004).

In general terms, the goal of an iTRAQ experiment is to iden-
tify differentially expressed peptides/proteins as a function of
different biological conditions. There is a requirement for sophis-
ticated methodologies to define signiﬁcance for the observed
changes in relative quantification, so that changes as a result of
biological regulation can be distinguished from those as a result
of technical issues. Value to the investigators comes from focus-
ing on identifying differentially expressed proteins as we describe
later in the text, yet identifying differentially expressed peptides is
a much simpler process. A fundamental assumption for all the
discussion is that peptides have been identiﬁed and iTRAQ
reporter ion intensities are available for these peptides.

Analysis of iTRAQ data starts from the processing of raw MS
signal to match spectra to peptides and extracting the areas
under iTRAQ reporter ion peaks, followed by empirical or stat-
istical methods to identify differentially expressed proteins. Early
efforts reported for iTRAQ data analysis included applying ad
hoc thresholds to the observed quantitative changes (Unwin
et al., 2006; Williamson et al., 2008) and using analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) to identify signiﬁcant changes after fitting the
observed changes with a linear model (Hill et al., 2008; Oberg
et al., 2008). It was proposed more recently that signiﬁcance of
the observed changes can be deﬁned based on the standard
deviation of technical variation, which can be estimated using
technical replicates (Zhou et al., 2012). The most recent advance
in analyzing iTRAQ data came from the observation that pep-
tides with lower iTRAQ reporter ion intensities tend to suffer
from larger technical variation (Breitwieser et al., 2011; Hultin-
Rosenberg et al., 2013; Hundertmark et al., 2009; Karp et al.,
2010; Mahoney et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2010). Many
approaches have been proposed to address the observed variance
heterogeneity, and as a result to achieve more accurate protein

quantities (Gan et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2006; Hultin—Rosenberg
et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2006; Onsongo et al., 2010) and an
improved capability to identify differentially expressed
proteins(Breitwieser et al., 2011; Karp et al., 2010).

A novel hierarchical statistical modeling approach was de-
veloped in this work to systemically evaluate technical variation
inherent in iTRAQ data, in order that variation inherent in
relative quantiﬁcation can be estimated for each individual pep-
tide and protein. Statistical models currently available considered
technical variation either as a single random variable (Breitwieser
et al., 2011; Hill et al., 2008; Oberg et al., 2008) or a discrete vari-
able with empirical values (Hultin-Rosenberg et al., 2013;
Onsongo et al., 2010), based on quantitative information from
peptides only. In this work, however, variation in relative quanti-
ﬁcation was modeled as coming from three different types of
sources, namely, instrument noise, bias on peptides and bias on
proteins. The developed hierarchical model enabled estimation of
these variations by simultaneously taking quantitative informa-
tion from both peptides and proteins into account. A novel
data analysis strategy was then proposed based on the hierarchical
statistical model and was denoted as Workﬂow for Hierarchical
Analysis of iTRAQ datasets (in short as WHA Traq).

Spiked-in proteins have often been used to verify data analysis
strategies (Breitwieser et al., 2011; Hundertmark et al., 2009;
Karp et al., 2010; Mahoney et al., 2011). However, the limited
number of proteins involved makes it extremely difﬁcult to rep-
resent iTRAQ datasets generated using biological samples.
Datasets using cell line samples with predeﬁned quantities,
i.e. known iTRAQ ratios, have also been generated (Hultin-
Rosenberg et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2010). Although these data-
sets were sufﬁcient to explore variation in iTRAQ, they were not
ideal to evaluate the capability of a data analysis strategy to
identify a discrete subset of proteins that are differentially ex-
pressed. In this work, a dataset was designed to simulate a real-
world biological system under regulation, in which a proportion
of proteins are differentially expressed and the remaining pro-
teins keep unchanged. Such a dataset was generated by mixing
identical amount of mouse cell lysate and varied predeﬁned
amount of Escherichia coli cell lysate then labeling with different
isobaric iTRAQ tags. Each sample was analyzed in duplicates to
allow investigation of technical variation within the dataset. The
dataset allowed easy evaluation of data analysis strategies in
that only Ecoli proteins were differentially expressed and the
expected quantitative changes were known.

WHATraq was firstly validated using the Ecoli/murine test
dataset, with its performance evaluated in terms of true-positive
(TP) and false-positive (FP) identiﬁcations. It was then further
validated by analyzing a biological iTRAQ dataset including
biological replicates from varied murine cell lines. The dataset
was designed to further our understanding of the role of mutant
isocitrate dehydrogenase gene (IDH) in the pathogenesis of acute
myeloid leukemia (AML). We demonstrated in this analysis that
although WHATraq was developed based on modeling technical
variation, it can be readily applied on the analysis of iTRAQ
datasets including biological replicates. The performance of
WHATraq was compared with two benchmark data analysis
strategies currently available [Isobar and standard deviation of
proteins (STDP), see Section 2]. It was observed that WHATraq
performed markedly better in discriminating differentially

expressed proteins from technical/biological variation, and was
capable of identifying larger number of differentially expressed
proteins with improved accuracy.

2 METHODS
2.1 Experimental protocol of the ﬁrst test dataset
(E.cali/murine)

Both murine and E.coli cells were lysed in 0.5 M triethylammonium bicar-
bonate (TEAB) and 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate before trypsin
proteolytic digestion and isobaric tag (iTRAQ) labeling was carried out
as previously published (Pierce et al., 2008) following the experimental
scheme for label use (Table 1). The dataset comprised four pairs of tech-
nical replicates and the expected fold changes were 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 0.67,
0.75, 1.33, 1.5, 2, 3 and 4. Before MS peptides were fractionated off-line
using a reversed phase chromatography column (Agilent Zorbax extend-
C18 3.5 pm particle size, 4.6 mm x 15 cm. Reversed phase column) at high
pH using an Agilent LC system. The gradient was run at 700 pl/min using
initially 99.5% (v/v) high pH buffer A [0.1% (v/v) ammonium hydrox-
ide], 0.5% (v/v) high pH buffer B [0.1% (v/v) ammonium hydroxide,
99.9% (v/v) acetonitrile] up to 40% (v/v) buffer B over 40 min. Twenty
15 s fractions were collected between 10 and 15 min. Each fraction was
then dried under vacuum.

Peptide was reconstituted in 30 pl of loading buffer [0.1% (v/v)
acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, 20mM citrate] with a third loaded
onto a nanoAQUITY UPLC system (Waters). A reverse phase nano LC
column (Waters BEH130 C18, 1.7 pm, 75 pm x 25 cm), with a 90 min
gradient running from 0.3% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid
to 40% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid separated peptides
for analysis. MS was carried out by a TripleTOF 5600 (Absciex) set up to
analyze the top 20 ions by MS/MS per an MS scan. The MS scanned
between 350 and 1250 with an accumulation time of 250 ms. Ions were
only selected for MS/MS if they were >150 counts/s and had a charge
state of between 2 and 5; ions previously selected were excluded for 30 s.
The MS/MS was carried out in high sensitivity mode with 100 ms accu-
mulation time and a rolling collision energy based on mass and charge
with a spread of 20. The MS/MS scanned between 100 and 1600.

2.2 Experimental protocol of the second test
dataset (IDH)

Murine Ba/F3 cells were transfected with either murine stem cell virus-
green ﬂuorescent protein (MSCV-GFP) retroviral vector or MSCV-GFP
containing wild-type IDH (thDH) or mutant (R132H) IDH as previ-
ously described (Pierce et al., 1998). The resultant cell lines were main-
tained in Fischers medium (Invitrogen) with 10% (v/v) horse serum
(Gibco) supplemented with 5% mIL-3 (conditioned media from X63-
Ag-653 cells).

Identifying significant protein changes by modeling iTRAQ variation

 

Nuclear proteins were enriched as previously described (Pierce et al.,
2012) then subjected to tryptic enzymatic digestion, iTRAQ labeling and
processing as performed previously. Quantitative data on the effect of
IDH mutant activity on protein expression was obtained by eight channel
iTRAQ isobaric tagging of biological replicates of Ba/F3, MSCV, thDH
and mutant IDH. The eight channel iTRAQ tagging experiment was
repeated twice to obtain data on four biological replicates.

2.3 Protein identiﬁcation

All MS/MS data were submitted to ProteinPilot software version 4.2
(AbSciex) for database searching and iTRAQ reporter ion quantiﬁcation.
Searches were performed twice against the Ensembl Mus musculus core 63
database and Ensembl Ecoli K12-lldatabase. Cys alkylation with
methanethiosulfate and trypsin as the digestion enzyme were speciﬁed
in the search. Biological modiﬁcations and amino acid substitutions
were also permitted. The false discovery rate (FDR) of protein identiﬁ-
cation was controlled using a target-decoy searching strategy (Elias and
Gygi, 2007) where forward and reverse sequences from a database were in
equal competition to be the highest ranking identiﬁcation for each spec-
trum. The q-value approach (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003) was then
applied to deﬁne a cutoff for peptide conﬁdence so that the control
criteria of FDR can be met. The maximum allowed FDR for protein
identiﬁcation was set to 1%.

2.4 Statistical modeling of variation present in
iTRAQ datasets

In general terms, the purpose of modeling an iTRAQ dataset was to
estimate the technical variation inherent in the dataset so that the quality
of the quantitative information provided by this dataset can be evaluated.
As a result, genuine changes in protein expression levels could be discri-
minated from technical variation. In this section, a novel statistical mod-
eling approach was brieﬂy described, with more detail of the modeling in
Supplementary Material S 1.

Denote the observed iTRAQ reporter ion intensity of a peptide as Io,
the genuine (technical variation free) but unknown iTRAQ reporter ion
intensity as 1,. It was observed that Io is heteroscedastic (Supplementary
Fig. SI) and this observation was in agreement with literature. Therefore,
the following multiplicative model can be assumed:

1,, = I, I e' (1)

where t represents technical variation.

In this study, technical variation was modeled to come from three
different types of sources, namely, instrument noise, bias on peptides
and bias on proteins:

[2 8 + bpep + bpm 

where 8 represents instrument noise, which refers to technical variation
caused by imprecision of instruments. The symbol bpep represents bias on
peptides and is used to model variation caused by the characteristics of
each individual peptide. Precursor coelution typically falls into this cat-
egory. Similarly, bpm represents bias on proteins and is used to model
variation caused by the characteristics of each individual protein. It is
worth noting that bpep and bpm are channeldependent, meaning that they
have different values in different iTRAQ channels for a same peptide. For
more detail on the validity of this model please refer to Supplementary
Material Sl.

Naturally, a can be modeled as a random variable following a
Gaussian distribution:

8 =f(I,) 42’

5’ ~ N(0, 1) (3)

where 8’ is a standard normal distribution. In Equation (3), the variance
of instrument noise is modeled as a function of I, to address the observed
heteroscedasticity. The form of function f(I,) is intended to be deter-
mined by the observed data. Although bpep and bpm are not random
variables, their impact on a dataset with sufﬁcient amount of peptides/
proteins can be modeled as following Gaussian distributions:
2
bm, ~ N(0, ope],
bpm ~ N(0 02

’ pm

This assumption was made based on the fact that bpep and bpm cannot
be estimated accurately for a single peptide or protein, therefore they
were approximated based on their average impact on the whole
proteome.

Denote a protein being successfully quantiﬁed in a given iTRAQ data-
set as P,- (i =1. . .n), where n is the total number of proteins, and the
peptides belonging to this protein as p), (i: 1 . . .n,j= 1 . . .k,), where k,- is
the total number of peptides being successfully quantiﬁed for protein P,.
The relative quantiﬁcation of 17,-), measured as log ratio of its iTRAQ
reporter ion intensities under two different biological states, can be
expressed as follows:

10g(1 0—1'1'1 / I 0-132) 2 10g(Ir_ij1/I,_i12) + til-1 — [02

With regard to relative quantiﬁcation between technical replicates, in
particular, the aforementioned equation can be expressed as follows:

’0‘ = tijl — [1'12

2 Eijl _ 5ij2 + bpeijl _ bpepJ]? + bpmle _ bpmJﬂ

where r,-/ is relative quantiﬁcation between technical replicates. The afore-
mentioned equations indicate that technical variation inherent in an
observed relative quantiﬁcation value, as the information of our prime
interest, can be estimated with the knowledge of f( I, ), ozpep and 02pm.
These functions and variables could be determined using technical
replicates present in an iTRAQ dataset.

A step-by-step approach was described in this section on how to derive
the formula of f( 1,) as well as the values of ojpep and 02pm from a given
iTRAQ dataset. Full detail on how the approach was derived can be
found in Supplementary Material Sl.

STEP 1: modeling technical variation on peptides

Divide all peptides into multiple small groups within which peptides
share close values of observed iTRAQ reporter ion intensities. For each
group, calculate the average of all Io (denoted as 7,) and the variance of all
r), [denoted as var( r )]. The function between var( r ) and iTRAQ sig-
nal intensity was assumed to have an empirical formula as shown in
Equation (4).

var(r) = 2a(i, + b)” + 2d (4)

Parameter a, b and c in Equation (4) can be estimated using a maximum
likelihood estimation approach.

STEP 2: reducing peptide redundancies

Merge the redundant peptides within a protein into one entry. Here,
redundant peptides refer to peptides sharing a same amino acid sequence
and post-translational modiﬁcation. For example, assume protein P,- has
k,’ unique peptides of a total of k,- peptides, and m of them have redun-
dant peptides. The starting and ending index of the redundant peptides
are s“ and t“, 14:] . . .m. They can be merged into one peptide entry
denoted as p,,,’ using a weighted average approach:

C.Zhou et al.

 

where W), is the weight applied on peptide 17,-). One option for W), is as
follows:

1
Wm

Weights of the merged peptides should be updated accordingly. This step
results in k,’ unique peptides for P,, each associate with its own relative
quantiﬁcation r,-/’ and weight w,,’.

STEP 3: deriving protein quantiﬁcation using only unique peptides

Assemble the redundancy-free peptides from last step to derive relative
quantiﬁcation of proteins using a weighted average approach:

kl.

I w;.r’..
_ J I}
R" —  k:-

where R,- is the relative quantiﬁcation between technical replicates of Pi.
STEP 4: modeling technical variation on proteins

For an easy annotation, deﬁne function as follows:

t

z(i,j,s, t, x) = Z

jzs ( WU)
1:3

Then the following model can be derived:

2
Wij

2(X)

var(R,-) = var(R,3,-) + var(R1,L.1,_,-) + var(R1,,,,_,-)
RP,,,_,- ~ N(0, 20%,”)

RMJ- ~ N(0, 2Z(i,j, 1,k;, a136,,»
RU ~ N(0, 220,), 1,k;. z(i,j, s... tu,f2(1r-ij))))

In this equation, f introduced parameters a, b, c and d. The a, b and c
have been estimated in step 1, and the remaining parameter d together
with ojpep and 02pm can be estimated using a maximum likelihood esti-
mation approach with the protein relative quantiﬁcation calculated in
step 3.

(5)

STEP 5: estimate technical variation and assign signiﬁcance for relative
changes of a given protein

Using the model derived earlier in the text, technical variation on the
relative quantiﬁcation of a given protein can be estimated:

var(R,-) = var(R,3_,-) + var(R1,,,,_,-) + var(R1,L.1,_,-)

Var(Ri3_i') = 20”}, likiifz (10-31)) + ZUJ, 1i ki'if2 (10432))

var(R,,m_,-) = 20;", (6)

var(R1,L.1,_,-) = 2Z(i,j, l,k;,z(i,j,s,,, t“, 01361,»

STEP 6: identify proteins that are differentially expressed

Statistical signiﬁcance of observed protein changes can be assigned
based on the technical variation estimated in step 5, in forms of
P-values. They are subject to FDR controls to identify proteins that
are differentially expressed.

2.5 WHATraq: a novel data analysis strategy for iTRAQ

Successful estimation of technical variation allowed a statistical signiﬁ-
cance (P-value) to be assigned to the quantitative change of each
observed protein. A cutoff value (q-value) can be derived so that the
expected FDR can be controlled to be <5%. Proteins with P-values

Fig. 1. Workﬂow of WHATraq data analysis strategy. A novel data
analysis strategy denoted as WHATraq has been developed for iTRAQ
based on the proposed hierarchical statistical model. It provided a com-
plete workﬂow starting from identiﬁcation and iTRAQ reporter ion in-
tensity data accumulation for each peptide, followed by a parallel
modeling of technical variation on both peptide and protein levels.
Technical variation on a speciﬁc peptide/protein can be estimated using
the derived models and can subsequently be used to identify proteins that

smaller than the cutoff were considered as being differentially expressed.
A novel data analysis strategy, denoted as WHATraq, was developed
based on the proposed hierarchical statistical model and its complete
workﬂow was illustrated in Figure 1. The strategy required an iTRAQ
dataset to include at least two iTRAQ channels to be technical/biological
replicates and should have identiﬁcation and iTRAQ reporter ion inten-
sity available for each peptide. It was capable of identifying proteins as
being differentially expressed. A detailed description of each step within
the workﬂow can be found in Supplementary Material S2. WHATraq
was implemented in-house using Matiab R2009a (The Mathworks, Inc).
The source code and the Ecoli/murine dataset (database search results),
has been made publicly available at http://www.scalpl.org/~czhou/
program code WHATraq.zip.

2.6 Performance evaluation of WHATraq:

The ﬁrst test dataset (Ecoli/murine) included defined fold changes ran-
ging from 0.25 to 4, i.e. from 4-fold downregulation to 4-fold upregula-
tion. Bigger changes were not included because they could easily be
identiﬁed by any data analysis strategy (Ting et al., 2011). Performance
evaluation was carried out by using WHATraq to identify proteins that
were differentially expressed. The Ecoli proteins identiﬁed as being dif-
ferentially expressed were considered as TPs and the identiﬁed mouse
proteins were considered as FPs. Ecoli proteins with expected relative
changes of 1.5-, 2-, 0.5- and 4-folds were used in this study.

We next applied WHATraq to a second iTRAQ test dataset (IDH),
which comprised multiple biological replicates. Important assumptions
for the analysis of this dataset were described in the next section. For
this dataset, we reported only the number of proteins that were identiﬁed
as being differentially expressed because it was not feasible to discriminate
TP with FP. The dataset was designed to explore proteomic differences
between thDH and mutant IDH, which was of potential value in

Identifying significant protein changes by modeling iTRAQ variation

 

understanding the role of mutant IDH in leukemogenesis (Dang et al.,
2009; Figueroa et al., 2010). We also assessed the effects of expressing an
‘empty’ retroviral vector as compared with a non-transfected control to
understand any artefacts that may arise from retroviral-mediated gene
transduction.

The performance of WHATraq was compared with two other bench-
mark strategies. The ﬁrst one modeled technical variation of all the
observed proteins as following a normal distribution, and the statistical
signiﬁcance of an observed change was assigned based on observed tech-
nical variation, as described in literature (Simpson et al., 2013; Zhou
et al., 2012). This strategy was denoted as STDP. The second one,
named Isobar (Breitwieser et al., 2011), modeled technical variation of
a speciﬁc peptide as an exponential function of its iTRAQ reporter ion
intensity. It is an application modeling peptide heteroscedasticity and has
been shown in its original publication to be a state-of-the-art strategy that
was able to identify more differentially expressed proteins than data ana-
lysis strategies developed earlier. STDP was implemented in-house to
have the same workﬂow as WHATraq except for the statistical model
applied. Isobar was downloaded from its developer (version 1.6.2) and
installed in R (version 3.0.1).

2.7 Applying WHATraq on biological replicates

Although WHATraq was originally developed to model technical vari-
ation from technical replicates, it can be readily applied on biological
replicates resulting in an estimation of technical variation + biological
variation, with assumptions and alteration described in this section:

(1) It was assumed that the biological variation of all proteins follows
one unique distribution, e.g. a normal distribution. This assump-
tion enabled biological variation to be modeled as a part of bias on
peptide/proteins (see Section 3).

(2) In the original workﬂow of WHATraq (Fig. 1), peptides with ex-
tremely large variation will be removed from contribute to protein
quantiﬁcation. This step was abandoned when biological variation
was modeled because biological variation was more likely to
induce extremely large relative changes.

(3) According to the original deﬁnition, bias on peptides/proteins, are
not random variables and therefore will not change as a result of
averaging multiple replicates. If biological variations are modeled
as a part of the biases, this deﬁnition becomes invalid and a pro-
portion of biases will be reduced by averaging multiple replicates.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to estimate the proportionality be-
cause biological replicates do not allow discrimination of technical
variation and biological variation. If it is assumed that biological
variation is dominant, biases should be treated as random and their
standard deviations are reduced according to the number of repli-
cates. Otherwise, it is safe to assume that biological and technical
variation are in a 1:1 ratio and therefore half of the biases will be
unchanged and the other half will be reduced according to the
number of replicates.

2.8 Normalizing iTRAQ channels for FDR control

We demonstrated that technical variations can be channel-speciﬁc
(Section 3). Therefore, using technical variation estimated from one
pair of iTRAQ channels to identify differentially expressed proteins in
other iTRAQ channels, a typical scene in analyzing iTRAQ datasets, may
lead to an unexpectedly high number of FP identiﬁcations. Here, we
developed a normalization algorithm to help control FDR.

We can denote c1 and c2 as technical replicates that were used to
estimate technical variation, chm and chm as the 40th and 60th
quantile of the log ratio between C] and c2. Similarly, we can denote c3
and c4 as the iTRAQ channels to calculate protein relative quantiﬁcation,

and Q4063” and Q6063” as the 40th and 60th quantile of the log ratio
between c3 and c4. The normalization algorithm is developed based on
the commonly accepted assumption that the majority of proteins will not
be differentially expressed, i-e- Q6OCIC2_Q4OCIC2= Q60c3c4—Q40c3c4-

Q6063 c4 — Q4063 64

Deﬁne normalization term N =
QGOClCZ — Q4061€2

The relative quantiﬁcations from channel c3 and c4 needed to time the
normalization term N for a more accurate estimation on technical vari-
ation and subsequently for a better FDR control.

3 RESULTS

3.1 General characteristics of the ﬁrst test dataset

In the E. coli/murine test dataset peptide spectral matches (PSMs)
identiﬁed to come from mouse proteins were 337 042 in number,
and the other 82 301 PSMs were identified to come from Ecoh‘
proteins. The PSMs with peptide sequences shared by both spe-
cies were removed, resulting in a total of 336 745 valid PSMs.
With the FDR control using the q—value approach, the PSMs
translated into 2938 mouse proteins and 750 Ecoh‘ proteins,
of which 2837 mouse proteins and 741 Ecoh‘ proteins had
valid quantitative information. These proteins were listed in
Supplementary Table S1.

The dataset was designed to comprise four pairs of technical
replicates. Protein quantiﬁcation was calculated based on the
average of iTRAQ reporter ion intensities from technical repli-
cates. The observed changes for peptides and proteins were
plotted in Figure 2, with expected relative changes of 1.5—, 2-,
0.5- and 4-fold, respectively. A considerable amount of technical
variation was observed in peptides but it was signiﬁcantly
reduced in proteins. The observed changes on Ecoh‘ peptides
and proteins were notably smaller than expected, representing
~40% of the expected changes (log space). The observation
indicated that iTRAQ as a quantiﬁcation technique tends to
underestimate biological changes, which was in agreement with
literature (Karp et al., 2010; Mahoney et al., 2011). The observed
underestimation was not improved by using more stringent
peptide selection criteria or aggregation into proteins.

3.2 Statistical modeling of technical variation

The relationship between technical variation and iTRAQ
reporter ion intensities, peptide masses and peptide retention
times were explored using the Ecoli/murine dataset. The
iTRAQ reporter ion intensities were the only factor found to
have dependency on technical variation (Supplementary
Fig. Slaw). Modeling the dependency using Equation (4)
(Section 2) enabled derivation of 95% conﬁdence interval (CI)
of the observed technical variation, as illustrated with red solid
curves in Figure 3a. The close matches of the CIs with the em-
pirical 95th quantile of the observed technical variation (blue-
dashed curves) conﬁrmed that the proposed statistical model
provided an accurate estimation of the technical variation on
peptide level. Technical variation on proteins was modeled to
come from three origins: instrument noise, bias on peptides
and bias on proteins. Their contribution to the total variation
was demonstrated in Figure 3b. Instrument noise, as indicated by
the red lines, was the biggest source of technical variation for

proteins with low numbers of quantified peptides, but its impact
quickly reduced for proteins with increased number of quantiﬁed
peptides. Bias on proteins (blue lines), however, was stable for all
proteins and therefore was dominant for proteins with high num-
bers of quantiﬁed peptides. Bias on peptides, as demonstrated
with green lines, showed moderate impact for proteins with no
more than five peptides. In general terms, the model assigned
smaller expected technical variation on proteins with higher
number of peptides, making them easier to be identiﬁed as
being differentially expressed. This can be interpreted as changes
in protein levels with more data accrued are more likely to be
genuine.

Variation models were built up for each individual pair of
technical replicates. As illustrated in Figure 4, all iTRAQ chan-
nels demonstrated similar level of instrument noise, indicating
that the MS instrument performed consistently in the experi-
ment. Bias on peptides and bias on proteins, on the contrary,

Fig. 3. Modeling technical variations on peptides and proteins.
(a) Technical variation present in peptides was modeled as a function
of iTRAQ reporter ion intensities [Equation (4)]. The estimated 95%
CI was plotted in solid lines, and the empirical 95th quantile was plotted
in dashed lines. (b) Technical variation present in proteins was modeled as
coming from three different origins, and their estimated 95% CI
[Equation (5)] were plotted. It should be noted that the CIs in the
ﬁgure were used for illustration purpose only, representing an average
of C1s for all proteins. In fact, technical variations were considerably
different for proteins with a same number of quantiﬁed peptides

were clearly channel-speciﬁc. The iTRAQ channel 117/118 ex-
hibited considerably smaller biases than the other channels (35.0
and 58.8% smaller than the average bias level). These observa-
tions indicated that using technical variation estimated from one
pair of iTRAQ channels to identify differentially expressed pro-
teins in other iTRAQ channels may lead to unexpected high
number of FF identifications. Normalization algorithms such
as the one proposed in Section 2 has to be applied to identify
a reliable list of proteins that are differentially expressed.

3.3 Performance evaluation of WHATraq

The proposed data analysis strategy denoted as WHATraq was
used to identify differentially expressed proteins in the Ecoli/
murine dataset, together with two benchmark data analysis stra-
tegies denoted as STDP and Isobar. The expected fold changes
of the differentially expressed proteins were 1.5, 2, 0.5 and 4. The

performance of all the data analysis strategies was evaluated in
terms of true-positive rate (TPR) and false-positive rate (FPR) as
listed in Table 2. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
were plotted to provide an overview of their performance
(Fig. 5).

WHATraq demonstrated a marked advantage over STDP and
Isobar (Fig. 5). In general term, all data analysis strategies per-
formed better on proteins with bigger expected changes, in the
context of TP proteins they were able to identify. For proteins
with 1.5-fold expected changes, STDP and Isobar failed to de-
liver meaningful results with only 1 TP protein being identiﬁed
and FDR >400% (Table 2). This is because protein changes were
too small to be separated from the dominant technical variation,
as demonstrated by Figure 2b (top left panel). WHATraq
struggled but was still able to control FDR properly with 14
TP proteins and 2 FP proteins identiﬁed. A clear advantage
from WHATraq was observed in proteins with larger changes.
For proteins subjected to 2-f old downregulation, both STDP and
Isobar failed to identify any proteins, whereas WHATraq suc-
cessfully identiﬁed 217 TP proteins and more importantly con-
trolled the FDR to 4.0%. Similarly, for proteins with 2- and
4-fold upregulation WHATraq identiﬁed no less than 118.7

were built up using each individual technical replicates. It was found that
the instrument noise (instrument noise was calculated at iTRAQ reporter

whereas the bias on peptides and bias on proteins are considerably smal-
ler in iTRAQ channel 117 and 118 compared with the other channels

and 62.8% more TP proteins than Isobar and STDP at the
same FDR level.

In general terms, proteins with larger number of quantified
peptides, proteins with constituent peptides that associated
with higher iTRAQ reporter ion intensities and proteins with
less redundant peptides were modeled to have lower technical
variation, and changes in these proteins could be identiﬁed
more readily. For example, an Ecoh‘ protein with an observed
1.29-fold change (EBESCP00000000712) was identiﬁed as differ-
entially expressed because of its 58 peptides being successfully
quantiﬁed. The observed fold change was considerably under-
estimated (expected fold change 2), demonstrating that the pro-
posed data analysis strategy was sensitive in detecting biological
changes. On the other hand, many proteins with big observed
changes such as a mouse protein (ENSMUSP00000045111)

ciated with technical variation, indicating that the proposed data
analysis strategy had an outstanding specificity on identifying
differentially expressed proteins. A full list of the differentially
expressed proteins being identified could be found in
Supplementary Table S2.

3.4 Data analysis of the IDH dataset

This dataset was designed based on the observation that point
mutations in the IDH have been detected in 1&20% of newly
diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients examined. The mu-
tations confer novel enzymatic activity on IDH facilitating the
reduction of a-ketoglutarate to D-2—hydroxyglutarate (2HG),
thus affecting the epigenetic state of the cells but the biologic
outcomes can vary with respect to cell growth (Stepanenko
et al., 2013). We have expressed mutant and wild-type IDH in
the Ba/ F3 cell line. Measurement of 2HG in cells expressing wild-
type and mutant IDH conﬁrmed novel enzymatic activity of the
mutant IDH (1440 ng/ml:l: 129 compared with 6933 ng/
ml:l: 1022, 7123). Furthermore, cells expressing mutant IDH
had a lower colony forming efﬁciency than those expressing
wild-type IDH (47:I:4 versus 60:I:4 colony forming cells/ 100
cells plated, respectively, n: 3, P=0.01).

To further our understanding of the potential effect of mutant
IDH on the proteome, we undertook a proteomic assessment of
the consequences of wild-type and mutant IDH expression, re-
spectively, in a cell line model. A total of 1742 751 PSMs were
identiﬁed from the IDH dataset. Processed using the method
described in Section 2, the PSMs translated into 5572 murine
proteins with valid quantitative information (Supplementary
Table S3). WHATraq was applied to model variation between
biological replicates, enabling estimation of a combination of
biological and technical variation for the relative quantiﬁcation
of each protein. The resulting model clearly demonstrated that
the total variation was dominated by bias on peptides and bias
on proteins, a pattern different with that in the Ecoli/murine
dataset (Fig. 6). Further analysis showed that the instrument
noise of the two test datasets was close in value, whereas the
bias on peptide and bias on proteins calculated from the IDH
dataset nearly double the amount of those calculated from the
Ecoli/murine dataset. It was reasonable to conclude that the
additional biases were transformed from biological variation.
The number of proteins that were differentially expressed be-
tween different cell lines is listed in Table 3. Similar to the results
of the Ecoli/murine dataset, WHATraq identiﬁed considerably
more proteins (375%) as being differentially expressed than both
STDP and Isobar.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work, a novel data analysis strategy denoted as
WHATraq was proposed for the analysis of iTRAQ proteomics
datasets, allowing differentially expressed proteins to be identi-
ﬁed. The strategy was primarily based on a novel hierarchical
statistical model that was capable of estimating technical/
biological variation inherent in relative quantiﬁcation of any
peptide/protein. The model beneﬁted from making use of quan-
titative information at both peptide and protein levels and

The ﬁgure showed the statistical model of a combination of technical
and biological variation at protein level. Bias on peptides and bias on
proteins dominated the total variation. Comparison with the model built
up on technical variation alone demonstrated that the values of instru-
ment noise in the two models are close, whereas bias on peptide/proteins
nearly doubled with the additional biological variation. Asterisk: instru-
ment noise was calculated at iTRAQ reporter ion intensity equals to 1000

estimated not only random noise as other published models
do, but also bias present in peptides and proteins. Here, bias
refers to the non-random effect from factors such as noise
from coeluting peptides and nearly isobaric peptides. It was
also demonstrated that biological variation can also be modeled
as biases. WHATraq was shown to have superior ability in iden-
tifying proteins that were differentially expressed due to biolo-
gical regulation, from changes due to technical noise compared
with other benchmark data analysis strategies such as STDP and
Isobar.

Biological replicates can be modeled using WHATraq result-
ing in an estimation of a combination of technical variation and
biological variation. However, such analysis was carried out
based on an assumption that the biological variation of all pro-
teins within the sample belonged to one unique normal distribu-
tion. Though the assumption was valid for the majority of the
proteins, many proteins could exhibit extremely large biological
variation. The invalidation of the assumption resulted in an
overestimation of bias on peptides and bias on proteins, which
in turn reduced the number of differentially expressed proteins
being identiﬁed. On the other hand, proteins with large biological
variation can also be identiﬁed by mistake as being differentially
expressed because their biological variation was underestimated
by the model. We would like to argue that including an

Identifying significant protein changes by modeling iTRAQ variation

 

additional pair of technical replicates to estimate technical vari-
ation may be the best approach to accurately identify proteins
being differently expressed because it allows biological variation
to be estimated for each individual protein. In large-scale studies
that include multiple subjects being analyzed in multiple iTRAQ
experiments, it was especially useful to include a pair of common
reference samples (such as pooled samples) as technical repli-
cates. This will allow comparison of protein expression level
across different experiments, e.g. for the purpose of estimating
intersubject variation.

WHATraq is more likely to identify proteins with higher
number of peptides as being differentially expressed. However,
sometimes researchers are particularly interested in proteins with
low expression level, which typically exhibit low number of pep-
tides in an iTRAQ dataset. In this case, an additional analysis
can be carried out to search for differentially expressed proteins
with only a limited number of peptides, using the same procedure
as standard analysis present in this study. Such an analysis will
increase the global FDR to a limited extent but provides a
unique chance for proteins with low expression level to be iden-
tiﬁed as being differentially expressed. For example, the analysis
on proteins with three peptides or less allowed identiﬁcation of
an additional ﬁve TP proteins (no FP) from the E.coli/murine
dataset.

Some proteins were identiﬁed to be changing probably as a
consequence of mutant IDH expression compared with the con-
trol cells expressing wild-type IDH. We also showed proteins
potentially expressed as a consequence of retroviral-mediated
gene transfer with an empty vector. Thus, it was demonstrated
that the methodology is applicable directly to real experiments.

It has been proposed in earlier publications that an intensity
cutoff should be applied to eliminate peptides with low iTRAQ
reporter ion intensities because these peptides usually associate
with high technical variation and provide inaccurate quantitative
information (Hu et al., 2006; Oberg et al., 2008). In this study, we
tested various cutoff values ranging from 6 to 230, which were
derived using the technical variation model at peptide level, cor-
responding to the standard deviation of technical variation to be
1.5, 1.2, 1.0, 0.7 and 0.5, respectively. We discovered that apply-
ing intensity cutoffs provided no benefit to WHATraq probably
because it has already taken the uncertainty from peptides with
low iTRAQ reporter ion intensities into account (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Instead, applying intensity cutoffs can decrease the FPR
of data analysis strategies that do not have technical variation
models at peptide level, such as STDP.

It has been shown that iTRAQ quantiﬁcation often underesti-
mates fold change due to several factors (Bantscheff et al., 2008;
Karp et al., 2010; Ow et al., 2009, 2011). Underestimation is
believed to primarily be a result of reporter ion mixing from
multiple coeluting peptides or nearly isobaric peptides. This
background effect has been reduced but not removed by
increased fractionation of samples reducing fraction complexity;
this, however, is at the expense of increased analysis time
(Ow et al., 2011). Another approach to eliminate the quantitative
inaccuracy of isobaric tagging techniques uses MS3 to add an
additional fractionation step to target peptide signals (Ting et al.,
2011). This is only available on MS instrumentation capable of
higher order fragmentation events and so cannot be applied in
many situations. Therefore, a model that can differentiate

between genuine changes and technical variation, such as the
one proposed here, is important for the correct identiﬁcation
of low level changes in the proteome.

5 CONCLUﬁON

In this work, we proposed a novel data analysis strategy called
WHATraq for quantitative proteomics experiments using
iTRAQ. Based on a hierarchical statistical model, the strategy
is capable of estimating technical/biological variation for each
individual peptide and protein, and subsequently identifying pro-
teins that were differentially expressed. We demonstrated that
the strategy was able to identify signiﬁcantly larger number of
proteins as being differentially expressed compared with two
other benchmark data analysis strategies STDP and Isobar.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Chromatin structure, including post-translational
modifications of histones, regulates gene expression, alternative
splicing and cell identity. ChlP-seq is an increasingly used assay
to study chromatin function. However, tools for downstream
bioinformatics analysis are limited and are only based on the
evaluation of signal intensities. We reasoned that new methods
taking into account other signal characteristics such as peak shape,
location and frequencies might reveal new insights into chromatin
function, particularly in situation where differences in read intensities
are subtle.

Results: We introduced an analysis pipeline, based on linear
predictive coding (LPC), which allows the capture and comparison
of ChlP-seq histone profiles. First, we show that the modeled signal
profiles distinguish differentially expressed genes with comparable
accuracy to signal intensities. The method was robust against
parameter variations and performed well up to a signal-to-noise ratio
of 0.55. Additionally, we show that LPC profiles of activating and
repressive histone marks cluster into distinct groups and can be used
to predict their function.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene expression is controlled at multiple levels, including factors
regulating DNA accessibility (Hobert, 2008). A combinatorial code
of post-translational modiﬁcations of the nucleosome proteins H2A,
H2B, H3 and H4, can render their associated DNA, accessible
or inaccessible for transcription and splicing (Watson, 2003).
Acetylation is generally associated with activation, while the affect

of histone methylations is condition and position dependent (Wang
et (11., 2008). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), originally
developed to enrich DNA fragments bound by speciﬁc proteins,
is now frequently used in studies of histone modiﬁcations (HMs)
(Barski et (11., 2007). In brief, a target protein, such as a transcription
factor (TF) or histone with a particular modiﬁcation is ﬁrst cross-
linked and immunoprecipitated using an antibody. The associated
DNA is then extracted and detected using methods such as a
hybridization array (ChIP-Chip) or deep sequencing (ChIP-seq).
The later approach shows advantages in resolution and following
bioinformatics processing provides genome-wide maps of TF
binding and HMs.

A large number of algorithms for downstream processing of
ChIP-seq datasets have been developed (Pepke et (11., 2009). These
tools generally evaluate signal intensities, with the aim of detecting
sparse, highly localized and enriched peaks. However, while this
is a common Characteristic for TF binding, the signals from HM
ChIP-seq are more variable. For example, H3K4me3 and H2A.Z,
localize at the transcription start site (TSS) whereas others, such as
H3K36me3 and H3K20mel, spread over many base pairs covering
the promoter and ﬁill gene body (Barski et (11., 2007; Wang
et (11., 2008). In addition, these signals often differ in peak shape
and location, as well as frequency. By focusing the analysis on
signal intensity alone, existing methods are potentially limiting and
constrain our ability to identify common motifs or patterns.

A number of genome-wide studies have recently been published
and show correlations between HMs and gene expression. While
each study varied slightly in processing of the ChIP-seq data,
in all cases, the read intensities that mapped to an arbitrary
region around the T55 of a gene were extracted and normalized.
A vector containing quantiﬁcation values from each dataset was
constructed for each gene, and these vectors were subsequently
correlated with gene expression using different multivariate
statistical approaches. The earliest work analyzed ChIP-seq data for
20 histone methylations (Yu et (11., 2008) and identiﬁed two major
gene groups by hierarchical Cluster analysis. The ﬁrst contained
active marks and genes expressed above average while the second
Cluster contained repressive marks and genes expressed below
average. A later study used the same methylation data but also
included measures of 19 histone acetylation proﬁles (Karlie et (11.,
2010). Here, a linear regression model was used and again revealed
that the HM ChIP-seq data was predictive for gene expression.

Signal analysis for genome-wide maps

 

A smaller study of the two methylations, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3,
applied a mixture of linear regression models and found that HMs
were more predictive for gene expression compared to TF binding
(Costa et (11., 2011).

Interestingly, these articles reported good predictability of gene
expression by three different computational models, all using
transformations of read counts as input. However, purely based
on intensity information, these approaches neglect other key signal
Characteristics such as peak shape and location, as well as signal
frequencies. Incorporating peak shape information will be essential
to identify HMs present on adjacent nucleosomes. The speciﬁc
locations of the histone modiﬁcation, e.g. in the promoter or
within the transcribed region, have been correlated with different
functions, including transcription initiation, promoter Clearance or
transcriptional elongation (Karlie et (11., 2010; Wang et (11., 2008). In
addition, recent data from ChIP-seq of H3K27me3 identiﬁed three
different regions relative to the TSS of gene, which independently
correlate with different gene expression levels (Young et (11.,
2011). Motivated by the biology and the shortcoming in available
algorithms, we propose a new strategy that quantiﬁes the ChIP-seq
proﬁle, making use of the pattern and location of the signal.

After data pre-processing, the linear predictive coding (LPC)
model, a method widely used in speech recognition, was applied
to optimally parameterize the signal. The derived coefﬁcients were
used as quantitative features replacing signal intensities. With focus
on the correlation between histone methylation and gene expression,
we ﬁrst validated our approach and show that it is robust, tolerates
noise and performs with comparable accuracy to read intensities in
a general and large-scale cross-validation. We then show that our
method can be used to successﬁilly predict the ﬁinction of HMs.

2 METHODS

2.1 Datasets and gene selection

In this study, gene expression and HM data of resting CD4+ T cells
was analyzed. The gene expression data, measured on an Affymetrics
whole-genome HG-U133A expression array, was obtained from (Su et (11.,
2004). Genome-wide ChIP-seq data were acquired on a Solexa Genome 1G
platform and obtained from Barski et a1. (2007). These included, 20 histone
modiﬁcations, the histone variant H2Z.A, as well as PolII and CTCF binding.
The recently established consensus coding sequence (CCDS) database (Pruitt
et (11., 2009) was used to map between these datasets.

2.2 Pre-processing of histone modiﬁcation data

The datasets from 21chromatin modiﬁcation, PolII and CTCF were referred
to as C={cl,cz,03,..., CM} and M223. On an average, each ChIP-seq
experiment contained 8.19 X 106 sequence reads with a length of 20 bp and
the total read counts that uniquely mapped to the genome were denoted as re.

The CCDS database was used to identify human protein coding genes g
that have high-quality annotations for their genome location. A genomic
window wg was then deﬁned for every gene, stretching equal distances
from its TSS and having a total length [(Wg). The positions wg 
i = 1,2,3, . . .,1(wg) represent the base pairs within the genomic loci.

Next, signal proﬁles at wg were extracted from all ChIP-seq experiments.
Therefore, the forward (+) and reverse (—) strands were ﬁrst considered
independently and aligned sequence tags at each genome coordinate i were
summed up into the read proﬁles rig, and reg, respectively (Fig. 1, Step 1).
These proﬁles were then joined to avoid strand-speciﬁc bias (Valouev et (11.,
2008):

rcg=r$(i—A)+rc_g(i+}t) (1)

where A is the peak shift parameter, which was calculated for individual
regions of 300 bp that exceed a threshold of 600 aligned sequence reads. In
each region, we ﬁrst indentiﬁed local maxima that correspond between the
forward and reversed strands, A was then calculated as the average distance
between these peaks (Fig. 1, Step 2).

The resulting signal proﬁles were transformed, using kernel density
estimators, into density proﬁles further smoothening the signal and increasing
resolution, which both beneﬁts the LPC estimation procedure (Pepke et (11.,
2009; Silverman, 1998). In addition, this step removed the overall intensity
information. The density proﬁle zcg was then calculated as follows:

. 1”
@m=ﬁgkmo (3

ago -rcg(f)

h (3)

ucg =

where n is the number of reads, h is a smoothing parameter and K the
kernel function. Here, we use the Gaussian kernel which is given by

K(u)= 1 2‘0‘5“2 and the bisquare kernel given by K(u)= {—2 (1—112)2 if

E
15 u 51 and 0 otherwise (Fig. 1, Step 3).

2.3 Computation of LPC features from ChIP-seq

LPC is a spectral analysis method that optimally characterizes a given wave
signal by a set of LPC parameters (Rabiner and J uang, 1993). It has a number
of desirable characteristics including a mathematically precise solution,
straightforward and simple implementation as well as low computational
costs. In addition, the LPC model is widely applied in speech recognition
systems, where it performs well in variety of applications. Interestingly, the
waveforms and large variance that are characteristic for human speech are
similarly found in ChIP-seq signals of different HM [compare ﬁgure 1 in
Pinkowski (1993)].

Therefore, we have investigated the application of LPC to parameterize
ChIP-seq data into spectral vectors, and use these features for downstream
bioinformatics analysis (Fig. 1, Steps 4 and 5).The basic idea behind the
application of LPC to ChIP-seq data is that the kernel density estimate zcg 
of the signal 0 at gene g and genome coordinate i can be approximated from a
linear combination of the previous signals 1— 1,1— 2, i— 3, ...,i—p following
(Rabiner and Juang, 1993):

where acg (k) with k=1,2,3,...,p are the prediction coefﬁcients to be
determined, and [7 also referred to as poles denotes the number of earlier
signals used. The approximation error ecg  is given by: ecg  =zcg  —

/\
zcg  and thus the mean squared error E can be expressed as:

1 ("’22)

E1: 2 [ago (mm—a] <s>

Having obtained an expression for the mean square error, we can derive an
optimal solution for each dog (k) that minimizes E:

 

315,3 _

dog

which can be solved by the autocorrelation method:

acg =Rggl rcg (7)

where dog is a p X 1 vector that contains the LPC coefﬁcients, RCg is a p X p
Toepliz matrix and reg is a p X 1 vector both containing the autocorrelation
values.

Fig. 1. Overview of the data processing steps from raw reads to the ﬁnal LPC parameterization for an arbitrary example of a histone mark 1.5 kb around a
TSS. First, raw read alignments for the forward and reverse strand are shown. After applying the peak shifting strategy the signals from both strands were
merged (Step 1). The merged signal was smoothened using kernel density estimates, and we show the ﬁt of two kernel functions here (Step 2). The LPC
approximations (Step 3, black) and their estimation errors (read) are shown for a smooth Gaussian density estimate (top) and a density estimate based on
raw reads (bottom). LPC parameterizations of the smooth Gaussian density signal are shown for three different parameters (Step 4). A heatmap of the LPC

2.4 Histone proﬁles derived from LPC and read
intensities

The LPC features acg, obtained from each of the analyzed experiments of
gene g, were summarized to the feature vector fg= [a1 ,a2,a3, ...,aM]. We
denote fg the LPC histone proﬁle (LPCHP) of the gene g as it describes its
overall histone pattern, including PolII and CTCF, measured by 23 ChIP-seq
experiments as described earlier.
In addition, histone proﬁles from read intensities (RIHP) were calculated.
Therefore, the signal proﬁles rcg for a given gene were summed as following:
“"121
1,5,:1og2 r— 2 rcg (i) . (8)
0 i2]
The ﬁnal values from all datasets M were summarized to the feature vector
f3: = [1; ,12,I3, ...,IM]. We denotef/S: the read intensity proﬁle of the gene g.

2.5 Cross-validation accuracies for validation and
parameter analysis of LPCHP

In order to identify reasonable model parameters and to validate the proposed
approach, we performed cross-validation analysis on several pro-labeled
gene groups. Therefore, the LPCHPfg, and for comparison reason the RIHP
f ’ , were derived for all pro-labeled genes and a supervised classiﬁcation (two
and three groups) was performed using the support vector machine approach
(Chang and Lin, 2001; Hastie et al., 2009).

In brief, for each cross-validation the full dataset is ﬁrst randomly split
into k equally sized parts, each part is used once as a validation set while
the other k—l parts are used as a training set (Hastie et al., 2009). In each
experiment, k supervised classiﬁcations tasks are executed and the mean
classiﬁcation accuracy over all runs is calculated.

In our analysis the classiﬁcations were run 100 times to allow for statistical
assessment of the results.

2.6 Cluster congruence for parameter comparison of
LPCHP

Cluster analysis using the average linkage method and Euclidean distance
metric was performed on the LPCHP with different parameters. In order
to quantitatively evaluate the congruence of these clusterings, we used a
popular measure called the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) (see Supplementary
Material 1 of detailed description) (Hubert and Arabie, 1985), which has
previously been used in bioinformatics applications (Thalarnuthu et al.,
2006). It measures the agreement between two clusterings U and V, and is
bound to ARI e [0, 1] with ARI (U, V) = 1 in case of maximal agreement (e. g.
identical clusterings) and ARI (U, V) :0 when the clusters are independent
(e.g. no agreement between the clusterings).

2.7 Histone function prediction through similarity
analysis of LPCHP

We investigated if functionally similar methylations also show similarities in
their ChIP-seq structure. Therefore, the full dataset C was split into two non-
overlapping sets, K containing well characterized transcriptional activators
or repressors, and the set X with histone modiﬁcations that are less studied
in CD4+ cells. In each set the histone marks were represented by the LPC
parameterization of some pro-selected genes, covering high and baseline
expression levels.

In order to identify structural similarities in K , we used a standard
hierarchical clustering algorithm based on the average linkage method and
Euclidean distance metric.

For functional prediction of histone methylations, we split K into a two
class training sets containing the transcriptional activators and repressors A
and R, respectively, and deﬁned as follows (compare also Fig. 3):

VAilAiﬂvAi,L},i=1,2,3,...,a
VRilRIJ‘IvRj,L}rj=1,2,3,...,/3 

where the indices H and L were used to represent the genes in GH and
GL. In order to predict the function of each methylation in x EX we used a
simple decision rule, deﬁned by the mean distance of x and the training sets
following:

1 “ d(x.a) .10....)
D =— + —
A 20‘; Z IXHI lAi,Hl Z lel lALLl
xeX xeXL
“EALH aeALL
1 d(x,r) d(x,r)
D =— —+ — 10
R 218,; Z IXHIlRJ-ﬂl Z ixLiiRMl ( )
_ XEXH xeXL
VERjJi reRLL

where d is the Euclidean distance. The histone methylation x is assigned to
the activation or repressing group following:

x_){ AszA<DR

R if DR <DA. (11)

Note that in case DA=DR no prediction can be made for the speciﬁc
methylation. The greater the difference between DA and DR the better the
prediction.

2.8 Implementation

The algorithms were implemented in Matlab (version 7.11.0.584). All
datasets including the ChIP-seq and expression array, as well as the
annotation ﬁles from the CCDS and affymetrix were imported to and mapped
between using MySql (version 5.5.14). The LibSVM implementation of the
support vector machine was used with default parameters (Chang and Lin,
2001). A Matlab script implementing the procedure outlined in Figure 1,
along with example input ﬁles and usage instructions are available from:
http://www.cancerresearch.unsw.edu.au/crcweb.nsf/page/LPCHP

3 RESULTS
3.1 Evaluation of LPCHP and comparison with RIHP

In order to validate the proposed methodology, we set up several
cross-validation experiments based on the support vector machine
approach with standard parameters (Hastie et (11., 2009). Following
the idea of the histone code theory, HM proﬁles are expected to
be similar within and different between gene groups expressed at
different levels. Hence, a logical way to evaluate our methodology
is to determine how well the LPCHP distinguishes different gene
groups and how this accuracy compares to a more traditional analysis
based on RIHP.

In an initial exploratory study, we cross-validated a large number
of all model parameters on a small gene set. This revealed that the
bisquare kernel with parameter h: 10 performed best across most
combinations. Therefore, this parameter was ﬁxed for the remainder
of this article. In contrast, the comparison for the parameter p
in the LPC model identiﬁed a number of parameters with good
performance, indicating the robustness of this model. Reasonable
values were found between 8 and 16, which is the suggested
range for speech recognition application, as well as smaller values
including 4 and 6, and larger values like 22 and 24 (Supplementary
Material 2).

For a detailed evaluation of our approach on a larger dataset we
ﬁrst deﬁned three gene groups for high (GH), medium (GM) and

This table shows the cross-validation results in two different experiments. In the ﬁrst
case the parameter p was kept constant for all datasets included in the LPCHP and we
report the best performing parameter p=4. In the second experiment, the parameter p
was adapted for each dataset in the LPCHP using the variogram approach. In this case
we show the results for two different parameters for H3K4me3 p=25 and p=28. In
each case the k-fold cross-validation was run 100 times and the best (ﬁrst number) and
mean (second number) classiﬁcation rates are shown.

low (GL) expressed genes. For each set, 500 genes were identiﬁed
based on expression measurements from the HG-U133A expression
array (Su et a1., 2004). The mean expression levels were GH=
3613.6, GM =209.66 and GL =2.39. The LPCHP and RIHP were
calculated and we visualized the ﬁrst three principle components
in Supplementary Figure S1. The RIHP clearly separated the three
gene groups, as expected from the literature. However, strikingly
the LPCHP also showed a signiﬁcant grouping, similar to the RIHP.

In order to quantify this trend we performed a k-fold cross-
validation with the objective of classifying the whole dataset (e.g.
1500 genes) into the three expression groups. The results for k = 10, 5
and 2 as well as using the leave-one-out strategy are shown in
Table 1, with more details shown in Supplementary Table S1. As
expected from the principle component analysis the RIHP and
the LPCHP achieved similar classiﬁcation rates. For example, the
overall differences in mean classiﬁcation from RIHP to LPCHP were
~2.5% for (GH,GL), ~4.5% for (GM,GL), ~1.8% for (GH,GM)
and ~3.3% for (GH,GM,GL).

In addition, the LPCHP approach performed well and achieved
mean classiﬁcation accuracy >75% over all four experiments. The
classiﬁcation accuracies between (GH, GL) were on average ~81%,
between (GM,GL) were 85% and (GH,GM) achieved only 65%.
However, this trend was expected as genes in GH and GM are
expressed with relatively high copy numbers and should be actively
marked on the histone level (e.g. GH =3613.6 and GM =209.66).

Therefore, we ﬁirther examined the predictive power of any
single HM to distinguish the gene groups GH and GM. We notice
that in this comparison the LPCHP outperformed the classiﬁcation
rates of RIHP for H3K79me1, H3K79me2, H3K79me3, H3K9me1,
H3K9me2, H3K9me3 and H4K20me (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Noise tolerance analysis ﬁirther suggested that the approach
remains accurate up to a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.55 and 0.3 for
Gaussian and uniform noises, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4).

3.2 Evaluation and robustness of LPCHP under
different parameters

3.2.] Evaluation of LPCHP with parameter settings customized to
each dataset In the last section, the same 1) was used for all datasets
included in the LPCHP. The cross-validation analysis resulted in
consistent classiﬁcation accuracies for a number of different I). Here,
we ﬁirther investigated whether a customized parameter 1) should be
selected for each dataset. Unfortunately, due to the large number of
potential combinations, it is not computationally feasible to cross
validate different p for each datasets included into the LPCHP. As
an example, to test only ﬁve different values, for each of the 23
ChIP-seq experiments, a total of 523 cross-validation experiments
are required.

Therefore, we utilized the variogram approach (see
Supplementary Material 3 for detailed description) to estimate
parameters for a number of selected genes from each ChIP-seq
experiment (Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Material
3 and 4). We found that the estimates were stable for the genes
within each dataset. An exception was H3K4me3, where the
variogram suggested two different parameters for high and medium
marked genes. In addition, for 19 out of 23 (~83%) experiments
the parameter was either 25 or 26. This stability is in line with the
cross-validation presented above. It ﬁirther provides evidence that
p can be selected constant for the analysis of different ChIP-seq
datasets, hence making its application more straightforward in
future applications.

However, the values derived from the variogram analysis differed
from those determined in the cross-validation of the previous
section. Hence, we revisited the cross-validation results for the
LPC parameters 25 and 26 (Supplementary Table S1). Further, we
investigated the cross-validation performance of LPCHP, when a
customized 1) (Table 1) was set for each dataset included in the
analysis. When compared to the previous LPCHP with p :4, we did
not ﬁnd signiﬁcant improvements on the classiﬁcation accuracy.

The result indicates that LPCHP is robust against changes in 1),
including cases where it was customized to each dataset. In addition,
the variogram analysis estimated constant parameters 1) from all
ChIP-seq datasets. Together this suggests that it is appropriate to
use the same parameter for the datasets analyzed here.

3.2.2 Analysis of robustness of the LPCHP parameters In the
analysis of the past two sections, our approach performed well in
cross-validation for multiple parameters. However, it is unclear if
different parameter sets extract the same structural information from
the underlying ChIP-seq datasets. Therefore, we further evaluated
the LPCHP using the recurring task of de novo gene groupings. We
reasoned that the proposed approach is robust in its parameters if
for different parameterizations p the clustering results are identical
or similar. This contrasts with clustering results that are highly
dissimilar or close to random.

The ARI was used to compare the clusterings for the genesets
GH, GL,GM when different parameterizations p and k-means
clustering (k = 3) are used (Fig. 2). In general, the ARI values were
high, indicating excellent congurence between parameterizations.

Fig. 2. Heatmap showing the congruence of clusters generated by different
LPC parameters, p, using the ARI. The histone proﬁles (fg) of 1500 genes
(high, low and medium expressed) obtained under different p were clustered
into three groups (k=3) using the k-means algorithm and compared using
the ARI.

The greatest similarity was found between three of the ﬁve tested
valuesp =4, 6 and 16 withARI of0.95 (p :4, 6), 0.93 (p =4, 16) and
0.95 (p: 6, 16), respectively. This suggests that further downstream
analysis would be marginally inﬂuenced if p was to be selected
among these values. Similarly, the smallest ARI 0.67 found for p = 6
and p: 8, was still relatively high.

The high congruence suggests that the proposed methodology is
robust for tested paramters p. It ﬁirther argues that the different
parameterizations tested recover similar signal characteristics, and
that the choice for p is less critical. In addition to the previous section,
this suggests that the parameter p :4 is ideal for the analyzed
datasets. Therefore, we ﬁxed this parameter, and applied our method
to the prediction of histone function in the next section.

3.3 Histone function prediction using LPCHP

In the second application, we investigated if structural features
obtained through LPCHP can identify commonalities between
different histone modiﬁcations. In particular, we hypothesized that
similarity information would be most apparent in the two sets
(GH,GL). Therefore, we performed hierarchical cluster analysis
of the ﬁve well characterized histone modiﬁcations associated
with transcriptional activation: H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3,
H3K36me3 and PolII as well as three repressive marks: H3K27me3,
H3K9me2 and H3K9me3. This analysis (Fig. 3A) indicated a
clear clustering between the activating and repressing histone
marks.

Motivated by this ﬁnding we hypothesized that the LPCHP could
be utilized to characterize or predict the function of less well-deﬁned
HMs. The LPCHP proﬁles calculated from the two gene groups
(GH,GL) were used as features for the HM ( Fig. 3B). A training
set was built using the eight well-characterized active and repressive
chromatin marks, as described above. Note that methylations that did
not clearly correlate with gene expression in human CD4+ T—cells,
e.g. different methylations of H3K79, H4K20me3 or the variant
H2A.Z that was previously associated with activation (TSS) and
repression (gene body) depending on the genome region, were not
used in the training set.

Fig. 3. In (A) The LPCHP for a set of seven well characterized histone marks
and PolII were analyzed by hierarchical clustering. We show the dendogram
for the 4th component of the LPCHP (p = 4), while all other dendograms are
given in Supplementary Figure S5. In each plot a clear clustering between the
activating (green) and repressive (red) marks can be seen. In (B) we illustrate
the histone function prediction as detailed in the text. Note, that in each group
of histone modiﬁcations, e.g. A, R and X, the distances between nodes were
calculated using the force-weighted layout within Cytoscape. Nodes were
colored according to the predicted function of the HM they present. We used
red for repressive and green for active marks.

The training data were then used to predict the potential function
of the other 14 histone ChIP-seq proﬁles in Barski et a1. (2007) and
Wang et a1. (2008). Within this set, seven marks were consistent
with active chromatin and the other seven marks were associated
with repressed chromatin around the TSS. Two of the seven
inactive marks, (H3K27me2, H2AZ) were also assigned as such
by Barski eta1., (2007) and Yu et a1. (2008) while ﬁve (H3K79me2,
H3K36me1, H3R2me2, H4K20me3, H4R3me2) were in agreement
with their known repressive role in gene expression (Xu etal., 2010;
Yu et al., 2008). Within the chromatin marks predicted as active
by LPCHP, four (H3K9me1, H2BK5me1, H4K20me1, H3K27me1)
were in agreement with Barski et a1. (2007) and Yu et a1. (2008)
while two (H3K79me1 and H3K79me3) were consistent with the
predictions made by Xu et a1. (2010). The LPCHP approach also
predicted an active role for H3R2me1. While this mark was assigned

as a modiﬁcation of repressed genes by Xu et a1. (2010) and Yu et a1.
(2008), it is known to accumulate across the coding regions of active
genes in yeast, where it correlates with active transcription (Kirmizis
et al., 2009).

Taken together, LPCHP performs robustly in predicting chromatin
ﬁinction when analyzing enrichment proﬁles at TSS.

4 DISCUSSION

The analysis of enrichment proﬁles is currently based on read
intensities and do not take into account signal structure. We show
that modeled signal structures (LPCHP) from a set of 23 ChIP-
seq experiments correlate well with gene expression. We also
show that LPCHP can be used to gain insights into chromatin
function. It is important to note that the binding proﬁles obtained
from HM ChIP-seq are a superposition of signals from the histone
modiﬁcation and underlying location of the nucleosome. Therefore,
the reported correlations likely reﬂect the inﬂuence of both factors,
and normalization in the presence of data on total H2, H3 and H4
levels is necessary to avoid this bias.

LPCHP is better suited for comparative studies of chromatin
function, particular in situations where the signal structure is
expected to change, while the signal intensity remains constant.
Importantly, nucleosome free regions (NFR) mark general sites of
transcription initiation for coding and non-coding RNAs, and are
inﬂuenced by a combination of DNA sequence and transcription
factors (Radman-Livaja and Rando, 2010; Schones et al., 2008).
If nucleosome repositioning is assumed in ChIP-seq libraries, our
approach is expected to detect the associated peak shift, while no
differences would be detected from the signal intensities.

The LPC approach can also be extended for the analysis of
other sequencing protocols such as the distinction of nucleosome
positioning between methylated and non-methylated CpG islands
(Choi, 2010). Incorporating peak shape information will ﬁirther
facilitate the identiﬁcation of speciﬁc TF binding to one of multiple,
closely situated binding sites, as typically seen in promoters of
critical developmentally regulated genes.

Furthermore, our analysis pipeline automatically reduces noise
and handles data scaling and normalization, while obtaining spectral
features, which can be further analyzed using a variety of previously
developed spectral pattern comparison techniques (Rabiner and
Juang, 1993).

5 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, both applications show that the LPCHP and the
signal structural that they represent, provide a useﬁil feature that is
currently neglected in the literature. Since we show that the LPCHP
can be used as an alternative to read intensities, its utility may extend
beyond ChIP-seq to other next-generation sequencing applications.
It will be particularly useﬁil in situations where read intensity
information is either insufﬁcient or non-informative. In addition, the
transformation of the original signal into LPC feature vectors is a
useﬁil intermediate allowing for the application of various machine
learning algorithms. As recently noted, a particular important task
in bioinformatics is the identiﬁcation of all possible chromatin
states (Baker, 2011), which could be obtained from a simple vector
quantization analysis of the LPCHP. Other potential applications
include the identiﬁcation of enhancer or regulatory regions in

the genome. In addition, further methodological development is
needed to extend the application of LPCHP to the analysis of
more complex genomic features. This includes, for example, the
comparison of HM binding structures in gene body regions that are
variable in length, and the number and length of exons, introns and
enhancers.

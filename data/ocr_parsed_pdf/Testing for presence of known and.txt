ABSTRACT

Motivation: Imaging mass spectrometry has emerged in the past
decade as a label-free, spatially resolved and multi-purpose bioana-
lytical technique for direct analysis of biological samples. However,
solving two everyday data analysis problems still requires expert judg-
ment: (i) the detection of unknown molecules and (ii) the testing for
presence of known molecules.

Results: We developed a measure of spatial chaos of a molecular
image corresponding to a mass-to-charge value, which is a proxy
for the molecular presence, and developed methods solving con-
sidered problems. The statistical evaluation was performed on a data-
set from a rat brain section with test sets of molecular images selected
by an expert. The measure of spatial chaos has shown high agreement
with expert judges. The method for detection of unknown molecules
allowed us to find structured molecular images corresponding to
spectral peaks of any low intensity. The test for presence applied to
a list of endogenous peptides ranked them according to the proposed
measure of their presence in the sample.

1 INTRODUCTION

Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a label-free technique for
spatially resolved chemical analysis by acquiring mass spectra
across the sample surface. A tremendous development of IMS
and considerable increase of applications in biology and medi-
cine have been observed over the past decade (Chaurand, 2012;
Jungmann and Heeren, 2012; Watrous et al., 2011). Various
types of IMS were developed for diverse sample types ranging
from biological and plant (Lee et al., 2012) tissues to bio
(Watrous and Dorrestein, 2011) and polymer thin ﬁlms
(Crecelius et al., 2012). In this article, we consider the matrix-
assisted laser desorption/ionization IMS (MALDI-IMS)
(Caprioli et al., 1997; Stoeckli et al., 2001), which plays the lead-
ing role (W atrous et al., 2011) in the rapidly developing field of

IMS-based metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics. MALDI-
IMS is used for imaging of drugs and their metabolites
(Ait-Belkacem et al., 2012; Prideaux and Stoeckli, 2012),
histopathological analysis of biopsy sections (Balluff et al.,
2012; Schwamborn and Caprioli, 2010) and discovery of new
biomarkers (Schwamborn, 2012) and drugs (Castellino et al.,
2011; Kroiss et al., 2010; Rubakhin et al., 2005; Yang et al.,
2009).

Given a sample, usually a tissue section, MALDI-IMS ac-
quires mass spectra at discrete spatial points across the sample
surface, providing a so-called datacube or hyperspectral image,
with a mass spectrum measured at each pixel (Caprioli et al.,
1997; Stoeckli et al., 2001). A mass spectrum represents the rela-
tive abundances of ionizable molecules with various mass-to-
charge ratios (m/z), ranging for MALDI-IMS from several hun-
dred up to a few tens of thousands m/z. A channel of a MALDI
datacube corresponding to an m/z—value is called an m/z— or mo-
lecular image and expresses the relative spatial abundances of a
molecular ion with this m/z—value.

MALDI-IMS data are large with a typical dataset comprising
500(k50 000 spectra where each spectrum has a length of 100$
50 000 m/z—bins. In current practice, such datasets are analyzed
either manually or using data-mining methods. Manual analysis
requires an expert to go over all m/z—values, plot their m/z—images
and examine them Visually. If there is any prior knowledge about
the sample [a histological annotation or pre-speciﬁed regions of
interest (Schwamborn and Caprioli, 2010)], then the Visual ana-
lysis aims to correlate the intensity patterns Visible in m/z—images
with the region of interest. Usually, one is interested in m/z—
images showing high intensities in the region of interest and
low intensities in the rest of the sample. However, often there
is no prior knowledge given or it does not describe the spatial
localization of molecules of interest completely. For example,
detection of drug metabolites cannot be done by specifying the
region, as these metabolites will not necessarily all localize in the
drug target area (Khatib-Shahidi et al., 2006). In the case of no
prior knowledge on localization of molecules of interest, the
Visual analysis aims at ﬁnding m/z—images, which exhibit spatially
structured intensity patterns (so-called spatially structured m/z—
images) as opposed to those which exhibit just noise (so-called
spatially unstructured m/z—images). We refer to this problem as
to the detection of unknown molecules in MALDI-IMS data. In
this article, we propose an automatic method that solves this

problem without specifying a region of interest a priori and with-
out Visual examination.

Another unsolved problem of MALDI-IMS data analysis is
the test for presence of known molecules when their localization is
unknown. For example, given a list of possible drug metabolites
or proteins, one needs to test for their presence in the tissue
section. With only few molecules to be tested, one can Visually
examine m/z—images of these molecules and judge whether they
are spatially structured. However, the Visual analysis in not feas-
ible for a large number of molecules and cannot be exploited in
automatic pipelines. We propose an automatic method solving
this problem.

In this article, we present a new approach to analysis of
MALDI-IMS data, which resembles the Visual analysis described
earlier in the text but selects spatially structured m/z—images auto-
matically. The core of this approach is the ranking of m/z—images
by their level of spatial structure, similarly to how it can be done
by the naked eye. The ranking is based on the original measure
of spatial chaos, does not have parameters and can be used in a
completely unsupervised manner. The spatial chaos is deﬁned as
a lack of spatial pattern in the pixels intensities; the proposed
measure of spatial chaos is low for an image exhibiting spatially
structured intensity pattern and is high for an image with spa-
tially chaotic pixels intensities. The problem of estimating a
measure of spatial chaos of an image is almost not addressed
in the literature. Most publications on structure detection deal
with finding structured patterns either of a given shape (Ballard,
1981) or based on edge detection (Mondal et al., 2011), but not
with estimating the level of structure. To the best of our know-
ledge, there is only one publication considering a similar problem
(Chubb et al., 1997), which presents a statistical method for
testing the null hypothesis that an image is devoid of structure.
Thus, deﬁning a measure of chaos of an m/z—image is new, chal-
lenging and certainly requires an evaluation. We propose and
apply a statistical evaluation approach by using a well-studied
MALDI-IMS dataset from a rat brain section (Alexandrov and
Kobarg, 2011; Alexandrov et al., 2010).

Based on the ranking of m/z—images by their measure of spatial
chaos, we propose solutions to the two described problems. First,
we will show how to detect unknown molecules by calculating
the measure of chaos of all m/z—images and selecting least chaotic
m/z—images. This can be used, in particular, for highly sensitive
peak picking by selecting a peak of any intensity if its m/z—image
exhibits any spatial structure, whereas all established peak pick-
ing methods at least partially rely on intensity and suffer from
low sensitivity. Second, we will show how to test for the presence
of known molecules by calculating the measure of chaos for their
m/z—images and taking least chaotic m/z—images. This can be used
for searching for drug metabolites of unknown localization. We
propose how the test for presence can improve current MALDI-
IMS-based protein identiﬁcation approaches.

2 METHODS

2.1 Samples, MALDI IMS, preprocessing

Sample preparation and MALDI-IMS data acquisition from a rat brain
coronal section are described in detail in Alexandrov et a]. (2010). Here,
we follow our short description from Alexandrov and Kobarg (2011).

The 10 pm thick cryosections were cut on a cryostat, transferred to a
conductive indium-tin-oxide-coated glass slide (Bruker Daltonik
GmbH, Bremen, Germany) and measured using a MALDI time-of-
ﬂight mass spectrometer Autoﬂex III (Bruker Daltonik) using the
ﬂexControl 3.0 and ﬂexImaging 2.1 software (Bruker Daltonik). The
lateral resolution was set to 80 pm. For mass calibration, the ClinProt
standard mixture of peptides and proteins (Bruker Daltonik) covering a
mass range of 2720 kDa was used. The spectra pre-processing was done in
the ClinProTools 2.2 software (Bruker Daltonik). The spectra were ﬁrst
baseline-corrected with the TopHat algorithm (minimal baseline width set
to 10%) and then normalized using the total ion count normalization. No
binning was performed. An m/z-image, even with no binning performed
after data acquisition, represents a narrow range of m/z-values (an m/z-
bin) due to a limited mass resolution. Then, spectra were saved into text
ﬁles and loaded in Matlab R2012a (The Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA,
USA), where the processing was performed using custom-made scripts.
The dataset comprises 20 185 spectra acquired within the slice area
(120 x 201 pixels), each spectrum of 3045 data bins in the m/z range
250(F10 000 Da. Before visualization, every m/z-image was processed
with the automatic hot spot removal method using quantile thresholding
(Watrous et al., 2011) with the quantile value 0.99.

2.2 Test sets of m/z-images

For statistical evaluation of the proposed measure of chaos and the
method for detection of unknown molecules, we selected test sets of un-
structured and structured m/z-images of the rat brain MALDI-IMS data-
set after visual examination of all 3045m/z-images. Based on our
expertise in MALDI-IMS and on our knowledge of this dataset, which
we analyzed previously (Alexandrov and Kobarg, 2011; Alexandrov
et al., 2010), we selected 50 unstructured m/z-images; see an example
in Figure 1. Then, we considered all images that looked structured
and divided them into four classes based on the patterns they exhibit,
namely, images with (i) compact curve-like sets high-intensity pixels,
‘curves’, (ii) large separated regions of high-intensity pixels, ‘regions’,
(iii) large sets of high-intensity pixels with visible gradients of
intensities around them, ‘gradients’ and (iv) small compact groups of
high-intensity pixels, ‘islets’. Then, we selected 50 images of each
class; see examples in Figure 2. The formulation of four classes of struc-
tured images as well as selection of 50 images for each class was per-
formed before implementing the method to avoid possible bias in
evaluation.

2.3 Measure of spatial chaos of an m/z-image

The steps of calculation of the measure of chaos are illustrated in
Figure 1. At the ﬁrst step, given an m/z-image I 6 Rle, where k x l is
the image size, we used a two-step edge detection ﬁlter for noisy images to
detect intensity edges inside an image deﬁned as sharp changes (or, more
formally, discontinuities) of pixels intensities. First, we denoised the
image with the bilateral edge-preserving denoising (Tomasi and
Manduchi, 1998) producing B = BF(I), where the width of the
Gaussian bilateral ﬁlter window a) was 20, the spatial-domain standard
deviation ad was three and the intensity-domain standard deviation 0,-
was 0.3; for the inﬂuence of a,- on the measure of chaos, see
Supplementary Figure S4. Then, we calculated the values of the discrete
gradient operator for all pixels of the denoised image
D = grad(B) 6 RM“. The high pixels intensities in the edge-detector
image D correspond to sharp changes of pixels intensities of the original
m/z-image. From D, we created a binary edge mask M e {0,1}le by
using the quantile thresholding. We assigned one to Nq the most intense
pixels of the edge detector image D and zero to other pixels, where N is
the number of all pixels in the image and 0 < q < 1 is the quantile param-
eter. The one-valued pixels of the binary edge mask M indicate the most
sharp changes of the pixels intensities of the original m/z-image. At the

baseline accuracies are calculated as the worst and the best accuracies among quantile values considered in edge detection; see Section 2. The square at k
equal to 50 shows the double cross-validation accuracy from Table 1. For the test sets ‘curves’ (21), ‘regions’ (b) and ‘islets’ ((1) our method detected the
structured m/z-images with the perfect accuracy of 100% for k from 1 to 23. The test set ‘gradients’ (c) is challenging, especially when detecting a low

intensity edges) [for more on edge detection see e.g. Canny
(1986)], then created a one-nearest—neighbor (lNN) graph for
the detected pixels by connecting each edge pixel with its nearest
neighbor. The measure of spatial chaos is defined as the mean
length of the graph edges. A structured image has clear intensity
edges with edges pixels compactly located, which leads to a low
measure of spatial chaos. The edge detection algorithm applied
to an unstructured image ﬁnds many separated intensity edge
pixels due to the pixel-to-pixel variation producing high-intensity
pixels randomly distributed across the image, which leads to a
high measure of spatial chaos.

3.2 Statistical evaluation of the measure of spatial chaos
by classifying test sets of m/z-images

We statistically evaluated the proposed measure of spatial chaos
on a well-studied MALDI-IMS dataset from a coronal rat brain
section presented in Alexandrov and Kobarg (2011); Alexandrov
et a]. (2010). First, we selected by the naked eye ﬁve test sets each
of 50 m/z—images: (i) a set of unstructured images and four sets of
structured images exhibiting (ii) compact curve-like series of
high-intensity pixels, ‘curves’, (iii) large distinct regions of high-
intensity pixels, ‘regions’, (iv) large regions of high-intensity
pixels with gradually decreasing intensities around them, ‘gradi-
ents’ and (V) small compact groups of high-intensity pixels,
‘islets’; see exemplary images in Figure 1 and 2. These types of
structured images were deﬁned by us after Visual examination of
all m/z—images. Then, we calculated for each m/z—image its value
of the measure of spatial chaos. For each class of structured
images, we calculated the double cross-validation accuracy
when classifying this class versus the class of unstructured
images using Support Vector Machines as described in
Alexandrov et a]. (2009) but without using the statistical test
for difference and discrete wavelet transformation; the double
cross-validation was used to ensure unbiased evaluation.

The classiﬁcation results (Table 1) conﬁrm that based only on
the measure of spatial chaos, we were able to automatically re-
produce the expert judges (structurediunstructured). The best
discrimination (accuracy 84%) was achieved for the structured
class ‘regions’ containing m/z—images with large separated
regions of high-intensity pixels. The worst discrimination (accur-
acy 55%, speciﬁcity 48%) was achieved for the structured class
‘gradients’ with images with large sets of high-intensity pixels
with Visible gradients of intensities around them. This can be

explained by the fact that the edge detection works well for the
‘curves’ images and cannot detect clear edges for the ‘gradients’
images. We hypothesize that using advanced methods for edge
detection such as active contours or so-called snakes can help
solving this problem.

3.3 Statistical evaluation of the method for detection of
unknown molecules

For the detection of unknown molecules, we calculated the meas-
ure of chaos for all m/z—images and selected m/z—images with the
lowest values of the measure; see Figure 1 for an overview. To
statistically evaluate the proposed method, we used the earlier
described test sets of m/z—images of the rat brain MALDI-IMS
dataset. One particular aim of the evaluation was as follows. At
the first step of calculating the measure of chaos of an m/z—image,
we detect image intensity edges by (i) applying an edge detection
algorithm and (ii) converting the edge detector values to a binary
mask (edge/no edge) using the quantile thresholding, see Section
2. We proposed that among various considered quantile values,
the quantile value producing the minimal mean graph edge is to
be selected, see Section 2. It is crucial to evaluate this method of
selection of the quantile value.

We proposed the following evaluation scheme. For each class
of structured m/z—images (‘curves’, ‘regions’, ‘gradients’ and
‘islets’), we mixed its m/z—images together with the m/z—images
of the unstructured class and then applied our method to detect k
m/z—images, where k varied from one to 50 (the number of struc-
tured m/z—images). This procedure simulates detection of k un-
known molecules in a MALDI-IMS dataset. Given k m/z—images
detected, we calculated the accuracy defined as the percentage of
those detected m/z—images, which are from the structured class.
For example, if among k detected m/z—images all are from the
structured class, the accuracy is 100%. For each k, we calculated
the best and the worst accuracies over all quantile values. These
two accuracy values serve as baseline values. Figure 2 shows for
each k (the number of m/z—images to be detected) the accuracy of
our method as well as the baseline accuracy values. First, our
method performs comparably well with the best possible quantile
value (the upper baseline). Our method is feasible in practice,
whereas selecting the best possible quantile value is not. To
select the best possible quantile, one has to calculate the accuracy
that requires knowing which m/z—images are structured. Second,
for the test sets ‘curves’ (Fig. 2a), ‘regions’ (Fig. 2b) and ‘islets’
(Fig. 2d), our method provided the perfect accuracy of 100% for
k from 1 to 23. That is, if one uses our method to detect 5, 10 or
20 (up to 23) structured images in the considered test set of
100 m/z—images, images from the structured class will be correctly
found. As expected, detecting images from the test set ‘gradients’
(Fig. 2c) is challenging, especially when detecting a low number
of m/z—images.

3.4 Detection of unknown molecules in the rat brain

After statistical evaluation, we applied the proposed method for
detection of unknown molecules to the rat brain MALDI-IMS
dataset. Figure 3a shows the sorted values of the measure of
chaos for all m/z—images of the dataset; ~500 images have com-
paratively low values (a steep part of the blue curve). For illus-
tration, we selected 10 equidistant values of the measure of chaos

images (Fig. 3c—i) with low values of the measure of chaos
look structured, whereas the last three m/z-images (Fig. 3k—l)
appear to be unstructured. Among all 3045 m/z-images, 556
images have lower values of the measure of chaos than that in
Figure 3j. Figure 3b shows the dataset-mean spectrum with the
10, 50 and 100 m/z-images having lowest values of the measure of
chaos. All detected m/z-values correspond to peaks. Multiple
m/z-images may correspond to different m/z-bins of the same
peak (Fig. 3b) and should be aligned as proposed in
Alexandrov and Kobarg (2011).

We compared the 100 detected m/z-images with 100 peaks
found by a spectrum-wise peak picking algorithm designed for
MALDI-IMS (Alexandrov et £11., 2010), which ﬁnds a number of
peaks for each spectrum and then selects most frequently found
peaks. Although the peak picking found most major peaks, it
overlooked a large peak at m/z 7100 as well as two low-intensity
peaks at m/z 3625.5 and 4385.9; the latter peak is discussed in
Figure 5. This illustrates a general disadvantage of spectrum-wise
peak picking methods, which suffer from low sensitivity, see
Section 4. Our method for detection of unknown molecules
can complement spectrum-wise peak picking increasing its sen-
sitivity, as it does not depend on peak intensity, but only on the
measure of spatial chaos of the corresponding m/z-image.

The processing time for the full dataset was 16min (0.31 s for
one m/z-image of size 120 x 201 pixels) on a laptop with i5
2.5GHz CPU, whereas the visual analysis, described in Section
1, aiming to select 20—50 structured m/z-images normally takes
>1 h and is still not as extensive as the automatic analysis.

To ascertain that the method of detection of unknown mol-
ecules is not overﬁt to the rat brain dataset, we applied it to
another MALDI-IMS dataset from a rat kidney section acquired
at our laboratory; see Supplementary Figure S1. The resulted
ranking of m/z-images of the rat kidney dataset was relevant as
evaluated by an expert.

3.5 Test for presence of known molecules in the rat
brain dataset

We applied the proposed method to test for presence of peptides
in the rat brain MALDI-IMS dataset. A list of 50 occurring in
rat peptides in the m/z-range 2500—10 000 was selected using the
Uniprot database (Consortium, 2012) (version 82, released
11.07.2012). For the list of peptides with their names, precursor
accession numbers and names, and masses, see Supplementary
Table S1. For each peptide, its theoretical monoisotopic mass
MH+ was stored into the list of m/z-values. Afterwards, for
each m/z-value from the list, we calculated the measure of spatial
chaos of the corresponding m/z-image.

The sorted values of the measure of chaos as well as 10 least
chaotic m/z-images are shown in Figure 4. All peptides ranked by
their values of the measure of spatial chaos are listed in
Supplementary Table S1, and their m/z-images are shown in
Supplementary Figure. S2. Visually, the ranking of m/z-images
looks in agreement with a possible expert rankng based on a
level of structure.

This information does not assume or provide peptide identiﬁ-
cation. The peptides detected as ‘present’ need to be validated
either by in situ MS/MS or by an extraction coupled with
LC-MS/MS (Gustafsson et £11., 2012; Rauser et £11., 2010;

test for presence to improve and make automatic current
MALDI-IMS-based protein identiﬁcation approaches, see
Section 4.

4 DISCUSSION

Our motivation to exploit a measure of spatial chaos to detect
unknown molecules and to test for presence of known molecules
is as follows. Selecting structured m/z-images after visual exam-
ination of m/z-images is the well-accepted approach of manual
analysis MALDI-IMS data and is a part of everyday work of an
imaging mass spectrometrist. Assuming any spatial differenti-
ation of the sample, one is normally interested in molecules
whose spatial distribution across the sample is not homogeneous.
Normally, only molecules corresponding to baseline signals (e.g.
matrix) have homogeneous distribution. In MALDI-IMS, the
baseline signals can have non-zero intensities. Owing to the
strong pixel-to-pixel variation, which is inherent to MALDI-
IMS, their m/z-images exhibit noise and look unstructured.

4.1 The need for highly sensitive peak picking

Earlier in the text, we concluded that our method for detection of
unknown molecules complements the conventional spectrum-
wise peak picking for IMS data by allowing a highly sensitive
peak picking; see Figure 3. This is an important achievement
because the two existing approaches to peak picking in IMS
suffer from low sensitivity.

In the average-spectrum approach, a peak picking algorithm
is applied to the mean, medium or quantile spectrum of the

dataset. As illustrated in Watrous et £11. (2011), this approach
is fast but not sensitive, as it does not favor high peaks pre-
sented in a small part of a sample only. For example, if a peak
is present only in 1% of spectra (for an image of 100 x 100
pixels, this is a large area of 10 x 10 pixels), then its contribu-
tion to the mean spectrum is reduced by 100 times as
compared with a low peak presented in all spectra (e.g. a
matrix peak). Figure 5 illustrates this effect. A peak at m/z
4385.9 detected among IOOm/z-values by our method (Fig. 3)
has a low intensity in the mean spectrum. However, the spectrum
acquired at a high-intensity pixel of the m/z-image 4385.9
(orange arrow in Fig. 5) exhibits a peak of a muchhigher inten-
sity at the same m/z-value.

In the spectrum-wise approach, a peak picking algorithm is
applied to each spectrum. Then, the obtained spectrum-wise
peak lists are combined into a consensus peak list, e.g. by
taking those peaks that are found in at least 1% of spectra
(Alexandrov et £11., 2010). This procedure also has limitations
in terms of sensitivity and can overlook a peak presented in a
smaller than 1% part of spectra. Additionally, an imperfection of
the peak picking algorithm might lead to overlooking low-inten-
sity peaks. Another issue inherent to the spectrum-wise peak
picking is the inverse proportion between efﬁciency and sensitiv-
ity. To decrease runtime, one can process only a part of spectra
(e.g. each 10th spectrum), but this reduces the sensitivity. The
sensitivity can be increased by selecting more peaks per spectrum,
but this increases the runtime for most peak picking algorithms.
This issue becomes even more troublesome as spatial resolution
increases resulting in a quadratic increase in the number of spec-
tra per MALDI-IMS dataset.

4.2 Detection of drug metabolites and protein
identiﬁcation

Several applications can be enabled by the proposed test for
presence of known molecules. First application is the IMS-
based detection of drug metabolites, which can be predicted
in silico, e.g. using DrugBank (Wishart et a1., 2006). Given a
list of m/z—values of candidate drug metabolites, one can test
for their presence in the sample and reduce the number of can-
didate metabolites or to select the most prominent of them.
Second application is the IMS-based protein identiﬁcation,
which is an crucial challenge in MALDI-IMS-based proteomics
(Gustafsson et a1., 2012; Rauser et a1., 2010; Schober et a1., 2011;
Stauber et a1., 2010). Figure 6 shows existing approaches to
MALDI-IMS-based protein identification. All of them involve
testing for presence of identified proteins in MALDI-IMS data,
i.e. currently done Visually, but can be done automatically using
our test for presence. When using on-tissue digestion approaches,
one can in si1ic0 predict protein fragments and to test both for
their presence and for their co-localization. Just testing for co-
localization may be not enough because of the strong pixel-to-
pixel variation that, together with the need to control the number
of false positives, requires a test for presence. Applications of the
test for presence will greatly beneﬁt from using the high mass
accuracy MALDI-IMS systems such as FT-ICR (Seeley and
Caprioli, 2008) and Orbitrap (Schober et a1., 2011).

4.3 Importance of high mass resolution

One can argue that the test for presence is feasible only for high
mass resolution IMS. In case of insufﬁcient resolution, a mol-
ecule of interest is not separated from other molecules of similar
m/z, and they are represented with one m/z—image. This can lead
to false positives, i.e. molecules can be detected as ‘present’, al-
though they are not. However, testing for absence does not suffer
from this problem. If an m/z—image has a high value of the meas-
ure of spatial chaos, then there is no molecule within the corres-
ponding m/z—bin, which has a spatially structured pattern and
contributes any signiﬁcantly to the m/z—image. Thus, the hypoth-
esis of presence of all molecules within the tested m/z—bin can be
rejected.

4.4 Other hyperspectral imaging data

The presented methods can be applied to other types of hyper-
spectral imaging with strong pixel-to-pixel variation, such as con-
focal Raman microspectroscopic (Puppels et a1., 1990), infrared
spectroscopic (Fernandez et a1., 2005), secondary ion mass

spectrometry (Colliver et a1., 1997; Watrous and Dorrestein,
2011) or nanostructure—initiator mass spectrometry (W 00 et a1.,
2008) imaging.

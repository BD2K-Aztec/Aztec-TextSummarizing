ABSTRACT

Motivation: Molecular interaction information, such as protein—
protein interactions and protein—small molecule interactions, is
indispensable for understanding the mechanism of biological
processes and discovering treatments for diseases. Many databases
have been built by manual annotation of literature to organize such
information into structured form. However, most databases focus on
only one type of interactions, which are often not well annotated and
integrated with related functional information.

Results: In this study, we integrate molecular interaction information
from literature by automatic information extraction and from manually
annotated databases. We further integrate the relationships between
protein/gene and other bio-entity terms including gene ontology
terms, pathways, species and diseases to build an integrated
molecular interaction database (IMID). Interactions can be selected
by their associated probabilities. IMID allows complex and versatile
queries for context-specific molecular interactions, which are not
available currently in other molecular interaction databases.
Availability: The database is located at www.integrativebiology.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

Molecular interactions, such as protein—protein interaction (PPI) and
protein—small molecule interaction, play important roles in almost
all biological processes. Information on molecular interactions is
indispensable for our understanding of the mechanisms of biological
processes and for the development of drugs. Due to the importance
of such information, manual annotation has been used to extract
it from scientiﬁc literature and deposit it into various databases
(Alfarano et (11., 2005; Aranda et (11., 2010; Chatr-aryamontri et (11.,
2007; Chaurasia et (11., 2007; Chen et (11., 2009; Han et (11., 2004;
Jayapandian et (11., 2007; Kamburov et (11., 2009; Keshava Prasad
et (11., 2009; Kuhn et (11., 2008; Mishra et (11., 2006; Pagel et (11.,
2005; Patil et (11., 2011; Prieto and De Las Rivas, 2006; Salwinski
et (11., 2004; Stark et (11., 2006, 2011; von Mering et (11., 2005;
Xenarios et (11., 2002). In recent years, computational methods have
also been developed to extract molecular interaction information
from the literature ...(Baumgartner et (11., 2007; Bui et (11., 2011;
Chowdhary et (11., 2009; Giles and Wren, 2008; Huang et (11., 2008;
Jensen et (11., 2006; Krallinger et (11., 2008; Wren et (11., 2004).

The context of molecular interactions such as the functions of
the interactions [related pathways or gene ontology (GO) terms]
and the physical nature of the interactions (regulate, inhibit or
phosphorylate, etc.) can be very useful for biologists searching
for those interactions. However, current databases do not explicitly
document such information. In studying molecular interactions,
a researcher may wish to ﬁnd all protein interactions related
to a particular biological process/pathway/disease/species, or a
combination of these terms (such as a pathway and a species). In
addition, the researcher may want to know those interactions related
to a particular type of chemical reaction such as phosphorylation.
Allowing researchers to perform the above complex searches
requires not only integrating the heterogeneous data from different
sources, but also organizing them in a highly structured form that
enables complicated queries. Availability of such tool will greatly
help biologists in their daily research.

In this study, we integrate molecular interaction information
from both manually annotated databases and literature (Bell et (11.,
2011a), and build a relational database, integrated molecular
interaction database (IMID, www.integrativebiology.org). Users of
IMID can perform complex and versatile queries for context-speciﬁc
molecular interactions. We expect IMID to be a useful tool for
researchers in biology and biomedical sciences.

2 METHODS

The collection of data has been described in detail in a recent study (Bell
et (11.. 2011a). The information in IMID comes from two types of sources:
manually curated databases and automatically extracted from literature
using a Bayesian network (BN) method (Chowdhary et (11.. 2009). The
information extraction method not only extracts the pairs of interacting
molecules. but also the interaction word describing the interactions. The
types of information in IMID are as follows: (i) PPIs including physical.
regulatory and genetic interactions; (ii) proteinismall molecule interactions;
and (iii) associations of interactions with other bio-entities such as pathway.
species. diseases or G0 terms. Information on individual proteins. such as
ofﬁcial names. synonyms and species. is obtained from UniProt database
(preiler 21111.. 2004). The synonyms of the same proteins are mapped to the
same proteins/genes. Interactions from different species are made distinct if
possible. An interaction is considered to be related to a particular bio-entity if
at least one of the interacting partners is manually annotated to be associated
with the bio-entity or the bio-entity term co-occurs with the interaction
in a sentence. The association information between proteins and pathways
was obtained from Reactome (Vastrik et (11.. 2007) and Pathway interaction
database (Schaefer et (11.. 2009). The association information between GO
terms and proteins was obtained from GO database (Ashburner et (11.. 2000)
and GOA database (Barrell et (11.. 2009). Both types of associations are
manually annotated. When more than one constraint is used in searching

PPIs. only the PPIs that are related to all the constraints will be returned. In
addition to the above information. probabilities of the interactions are also
given. The BN method assigns probabilities to all automatically extracted
interactions. Overall. our database has several unique features compared
with other databases:

(1) The interactions in the database are linked to their biological context
represented by various biological terms. A relational database is built
so that users can select a subset of interactions related to one or a
combination of the terms.

(2) Users can also select interactions by several other ﬁlters such as
the type of molecules involved in the interactions (proteiniprotein
or proteinismall molecule) and the type of interactions (regulations.
genetic interactions or physical interactions). They can also use the
interaction words (phosphorylate. methylate. inhibit. etc.) to select a
subset of interactions they are interested in.

(3) The database stores both PPIs and proteinismall molecule
interactions.

(4) The database stores both manually annotated and automatically
extracted interaction information. The two types of information can
be easily separated using a probability ﬁlter.

3 USAGE

The query interface of IMID (Fig. 1) allows users to perform two
types of searches.

(1) Query using any protein/gene or small molecule names in
Molecule Name text box. We allow only one protein, gene or small
molecule name in this box. Other constraints can be applied using
the dropdown and/or text box below the Molecule Name box. Only
stande names can be used for search. Using standard ontology
systems allows more accurate deﬁnition of PPIs and more efﬁcient
search performance.

Molecule Type dropdown box allows users to select protein—
protein, protein—small molecule or both types of interactions.

Interaction Type dropdown box contains four types of
interactions: genetic interaction/association, interaction, physical
interaction and regulation. Interactions are grouped to the above
types according to the interaction words that are extracted together
with the interactions in the text or based on the annotation given
in other databases. The type interaction is rather generic, which
represents interactions of unknown nature.

Interaction Word dropdown box contains the list of words we
used in automatic extraction of molecular interactions. Selecting
any word will limit interactions described by that word and its
related forms (i.e. -ed, -ing, -s, etc.). Some interaction words carry
directionality information, which can be quite useﬁil for network
studies (Giles and Wren, 2008). Although we have developed a
method for the inference of directionality information (Bell et al.,
201 1b), the method has not been applied to the large-scale extraction
of protein interaction information we performed earlier. As a result,
directionality information is not given in the output table. We plan
to include this information in ﬁiture update of the database.

Probability dropdown box discretizes probability into intervals
of size 0.1. Manually annotated interactions have probability of 1.
Selecting 1 will ﬁlter out all automatically extracted interactions.

In addition to the above, Pathway, Disease, GO and Species can
also be used individually or in combination to select the subset of
PPIs a researcher is interested in.

(2) Without inputting any names at Molecule Name text box,
users can search interactions related to other conditions selected.

For example, selecting insulin pathway in the Pathway dropdown
box and human in Species text box will return all the interactions
related to human insulin pathway.

The output interactions are given in a table below the search
box containing several types of information including a PubMed
ID and links to the PubMed abstracts where the interactions were
obtained from. The interactions displayed in the table can be
downloaded by the users. For larger download sizes, users are
encouraged to contact us for assistance. The interactions shown in
the table are automatically plotted as a network for users to visualize
using Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011). For performance and user
experience considerations, only interactions shown in the current
page of the table are plotted.

Figure 2 shows the networks for ABC transporter pathway
obtained by searching ABC transporter as the pathway name, homo
sapiens as species name and a probability cut off of 0.8. Both PPI
and protein—small molecule interaction are shown. Squares represent
proteins and triangles represent small molecules.

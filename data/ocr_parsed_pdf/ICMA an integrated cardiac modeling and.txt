Abstract

Summary: ICMA, a software framework to create 3D finite element models of the left ventricle
from cardiac ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, has been made available as an
open—source code. The framework is hardware vendor independent and uses speckle tracking
(endocardial border detection) on ultrasound (MRI) imaging data in the form of DICOM. Standard
American Heart Association segment—based strain analysis can be performed using a browser—
based interface. The speckle tracking, border detection and model fitting methods are implemented
in C++ using open—source tools. They are wrapped as web services and orchestrated via a JBOSS—

based application server.

Availability and implementation: The source code for ICMA is freely available under MPL 1.1 or
GPL 2.0 or LGPL 2.1 license at https://github.com/ABl—Software—Laboratory/ICMA and a standalone

virtual machine at http://goo.gl/M4|JKH for download.

1 Introduction

Cardiac echocardiography is a widely used modality to assess wall
motion due to its non-invasiveness and comparatively lower setup
costs. Most ultrasound vendors provide proprietary software to ana-
lyze the echocardiogram, for instance, GE’s EchoPac and Phillips’s
QLAB. The software enables cardiologists to determine clinically
relevant parameters such as ejection-fraction, regional wall strain
etc. However, these software components are expensive, tied to the
vendor hardware and not open-source.

Clinical reports generated by the software vary across vendors
for the same patient data and therefore there is a lack of standard-
ization across the vendors. This makes it difficult to perform multi-
site, population-based studies where data are collected from
hardware developed by a multitude of vendors.

We developed a model guided speckle tracking method that
tracks left ventricular wall motion in cardiac ultrasound images.
The motion data are then used to fit a finite element model (FEM)
to reconstruct the ventricular geometry. Motion information from
one or more ultrasound views can be combined to improve the re-
constructed geometry. These modules are independent of each other
and wall motion data gathered from other modalities like MRI can
also he used. Diagnostic parameters such as regional strain, ejection-
fraction, etc. are determined from the model that represents the ven-
tricular geometry.

Using a hrowser-hased graphical user interface, with a workflow
similar to existing software, the user can guide the geometry recon-
struction process by choosing the images to he used, providing land-
marks at the beginning and end R-wave frames (the framework

uted to proprietary software products and their designed incompati—
bility with other software and hardware vendors. We believe that an
open—source community—led effort to develop software for such
applications can reduce these costs and ICMA presents a model im—
plementation that can be improved upon.

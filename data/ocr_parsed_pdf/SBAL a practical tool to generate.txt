ABSTRACT

Summary: Both alignment generation and visualization are
important processes for producing biologically meaningful sequence
alignments. Computational tools that combine reliable, automated
and semi-automated approaches to produce secondary structure-
based alignments with an appropriate visualization of the results
are rare. We have developed SBAL, a tool to generate and edit
secondary structure-based sequence alignments. It is easy to install
and provides a user-friendly interface. Sequence alignments are
displayed, with secondary structure assignments mapped to their
corresponding regions in the sequence by using a simple colour
scheme. The algorithm implemented for automated and semi-
automated secondary structure-based alignment calculations shows
a comparable performance to existing software.

Availability and implementation: SBAL has been implemented in
Java to provide cross-platform compatibility. SBAL is freely available
to academic users at http://www.structuralchemistry.org/pcsb/.
Users will be asked for their name, institution and email address.
A manual can also be downloaded from this site. The software,
manual and test sets are also available as supplementary material.

1 INTRODUCTION

Accurate amino acid sequence alignments are central to many
bioinformatic, biochemical and structural studies. In structural
biology, amino acid sequence alignments are used to not only
identify conserved residues that may be functionally signiﬁcant,
but also regions of conserved secondary structure that may provide
information on the overall fold of the molecule.

Of the alignment algorithms that are currently available, only a
handful take into account secondary structure information; namely
PRALINE (Simossis and Heringa, 2005), SPEM (Zhou and Zhou,
2005), PROMALS (Pei and Grishin, 2007), ISPAlign (Lu and Sze,
2008) and OPAL (Wheeler and Kececioglu, 2007). Despite using
different approaches to implement secondary structure information
into multiple sequence alignments, these programs have shown

that signiﬁcant improvements in accuracy can be achieved when
secondary structure information is included.

However, a limitation of currently available programs is that
they do not provide an easy means of visualizing alignments and
secondary structure predictions after they have been generated.
The visualization of alignments is an important part of the entire
process of alignment generation, not only for quality control, but
also for analysis and interpretation of the biological context of the
alignments. Additionally, manual editing can frequently improve
alignments because most algorithms apply heuristic approaches that
may not generate an optimal solution.

Despite the variety of alignment programs (Notredame, 2002)
and viewers available (Anderson et (11., 2011; Goode and Rodrigo,
2007; Gouy et (11., 2010; Lord et al., 2002; Waterhouse et al.,
2009), we found the process of generating secondary structure-
based alignments and appropriate visualization difﬁcult. Some
tools are only available as web-based applications (Ginalski et al.,
2003; Pei et al., 2008; soding et al., 2005) and others require
complex installation and compilation. Some visualization tools
are specialized for other purposes, such as for phylogenetic
reconstructions. Additionally, visualization of secondary structure
assignments on a multiple sequence alignment in most programs
is complicated and does not allow for easy visual comparisons. We
have implemented a simple-to-use and portable Java application that
aids in the generation of structure-based sequence alignments by
providing an automated alignment that may be edited and improved
by the user through a user-friendly graphical user interface.

2 METHODS

SBAL is a Java application that builds on and extends fundamental Java
classes developed within the Programme Collection for Structural Biology
and Biophysical Chemistry (PCSB) (Hofmann and Wlodawer. 2002). In
order to provide single sequence secondary structure prediction within
SBAL. the neural network approach of PSIPRED (Bryson at al.. 2005)
has been implemented in Java. In SBAL. secondary structure information
is restricted to three elements: ot-helix. ﬁ-strand and unstructured (random
coil). We have also implemented a novel progressive alignment algorithm
(see Supplementary Material for more details).

SBAL was tested on the BAliBASE (Thompson et al.. 1999) benchmark
alongside ISPAlign (Lu and Sze. 2008). SPEM (Zhou and Zhou, 2005) and
OPAL (Wheeler and Kececioglu, 2007). The performance of the programs
was evaluated using the scoring software that accompanies the BAliBASE
benchmark. The results are provided in the Supplementary Material.

Fig. 1. Main window display of SBAL. The layout design is simple to
allow users to focus on the important features of the alignment. Regions
of secondary structure are coloured (oz-helical positions are coloured in
green and ﬁ-strand positions are coloured in red). A variety of ﬁle, editing,
alignment and analysis options can be accessed from the menu bar, and
several shortcut keys have also been programmed. A dynamically updated
status (bottom of the window) and progress bar (left of window) are provided
for interactivity.

3 RESULTS

Currently, there is a need for a computational tool that facilitates
the seamless transition from secondary structure-based alignments
to the visualization of the results. In this context, we have developed
SBAL to generate and edit secondary structure-based sequence
alignments. SBAL has been implemented in Java to provide
cross-platform compatibility. It is easy to install and provides an
interactive user-friendly interface (Fig. 1). Users can choose to
either generate secondary structure-based alignments using SBAL
or import alignment results from other programs for visualization
and editing, thus making SBAL a very versatile and practical tool
for a wide range of scenarios.

A variety of established input formats (FASTA, MSF and
ClustalW) are supported to ensure compatibility with commonly
used alignment programs. Secondary structure information can
be provided by different means: predicted secondary structure by
PSIPRED (Bryson et (11., 2005) can be processed from the PSIPRED
vertical (ss2-ﬁles) or horizontal (horiz-ﬁles) format, extracted from
experimental 3D structures by DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983),
or directly from the header of Protein Data Bank ﬁles (HELIX
and SHEET records). Secondary structure information is instantly
mapped to the corresponding regions of the sequences by using a
red—green colour scheme to facilitate visual comparisons.

We have implemented a progressive multiple alignment algorithm
that aims to maximize secondary structure and amino acid matches
using position-speciﬁc information. There are three ﬁindamental
steps: (i) an initial guide tree construction; followed by (ii) a dynamic
programming-based alignment generation; and (iii) a ﬁnal ‘polishing
step’ that realigns the sequences. SBAL produces alignments of
a comparable quality as those achieved using other structure-
based alignment programs (see Supplementary Material for a more
thorough analysis). Although some features that have been proposed
to further improve accuracy have not been implemented in SBAL
and are destined for inclusion in the near future.

Multiple amino acid sequence alignments can be modiﬁed by the
user through insertion and deletion of gaps as well as horizontal
movement of sequences with respect to the alignment. N— or
C-terminal extensions of sequences that should not be included in
the alignment can be truncated within SBAL. These ﬁinctions can

be executed for an individual sequence or a user-selected group of
sequences. Scores representing the level of sequence and secondary
structure conservation of the alignment are displayed in the status
bar. The vertical order of sequences within the alignment can also
be changed.

Alignments are saved in three ﬁle formats with the same root
name: SBAL, HTML and FASTA. Reloading the SBAL ﬁle allows
the user to continue to work on the alignment. The HTML output is
considered the best format for dissemination, since it can be loaded
into other editors or Word processing programs without losing the
secondary structure mapping. The FASTA output ﬁle is provided for
interfacing with other bioinformatic software.

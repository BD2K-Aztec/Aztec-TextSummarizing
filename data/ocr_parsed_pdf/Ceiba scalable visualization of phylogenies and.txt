ABSTRACT

Summary: Phylogenetic trees with hundreds of thousands of leaves
are now being inferred from sequence data, posing significant
challenges for visualization and exploratory analysis. Image data
supplying valuable context for species in trees (and cues for exploring
them) are becoming increasingly available in biodiversity databases
and elsewhere but have rarely been built into tree visualization
software in a scalable way. Ceiba lets the user explore large
trees and inspect image collection arrays (sets of ‘homologous’
images) comprising mixtures of 2D and 3D image objects. Ceiba
exploits recent improvements in graphics hardware, OpenGL toolkits
and many standard high-performance computer graphics strategies,
such as texture compression, level of detail control, culling,
animations and image caching. Its tree layouts can be tuned by
user-provided phylogenetic definitions of subtrees. The code has
been extensively tested on phylogenies of up to 55000 leaves and
images.

1 INTRODUCTION

Information Visualization can foster exploratory analysis of large
and complex datasets. Phylogenetic tree Visualization has been
an active area of research in the past decade (Page, 2012), with
competing programs offering signiﬁcantly different features, user
interfaces and scalability (Block et al., 2012; Hughes et al., 2004;
Huson and Scornavacca, 2012; Jordan and Piel, 2008; Kim and
Lee, 2007; Munzner et al., 2003; Rosindell and Harmon, 2012;
Sanderson, 2006; one website lists 113 programs: http://bioinfo.
unice.fr/biodiV/Tree_editors.html; see Supplementary Table S1).
In recent years, scalability has assumed greater importance, as
phylogenetic trees have markedly increased in size. Trees with
~1000 leaves are now fairly common (e.g. Fabre et al., 2012),
and attempts to build trees with 10 000750 000 or more leaves
(Smith et al., 2011) signal the increasing demand for large trees in
comprehensive comparative studies in ecology, evolution and
other domains (Roquet et al., 2013).

Phylogenetic trees are often annotated with low complexity
data, such as discrete traits (e. g. nucleotides), but many biological
features, such as morphological traits, are of much higher com-
plexity, and are commonly Visualized as 2D images or 3D models
reconstructed from CT scans (e. g. McPeek et al., 2008). Although
some tree Visualization programs allow imbedded images (e.g.
Letunic and Bork, 2011; see Supplementary Table S1), image
processing capabilities have not been prominently featured in
their development, and some basic challenges to their integration
into phylogenies remain. For example, in conventional 2D tree
layouts, images often either occlude one another or must be
greatly reduced in size to avoid this. Scalable integration of
image data with tree Visualization could foster exploration of
comparative patterns in at least two ways: first, by using these
data themselves as cues to aid navigation and exploration at large
tree scales, and second, to embed these complex data types in an
interactive phylogenetic framework that highlights the evolution-
ary links between the images. The latter may come from large
databases of whole organism images, such as Encyclopedia of
Life (http://eol.org), databases of speciﬁc traits, such as
MorphBank (http://www.morphbank.net), of 3D models derived
from CT scans, such as Digimorph (http://www.digimorph.org).

2 METHODS

Ceiba originated in the Paloverde tree visualization code (Sanderson,
2006), but Ceiba’s new layout schema combines a much more scalable
hierarchical decomposition of large trees with code re-engineered to
integrate image data. Ceiba ‘layouts’ are of two kinds. The ﬁrst speciﬁes
how the input tree is decomposed into a hierarchy of subtrees, determined
automatically or by user-supplied phylogenetic deﬁnitions of subtrees.
The second concerns the visual appearance of these subtrees, how they
relate to each other when rendered and their integration with image data.
Subtrees can be rendered either as conventional 2D trees like layouts
available in other software, or as 3D objects that look like botanical
‘trees’. Subtrees are combined in two visual layout schemes. In the ‘3D’
scheme, all subtrees are displayed as 3D objects. Navigation is effected by
selecting subtrees and recursively zooming into this deﬁned 3D space.
In the ‘fan’ scheme, the root subtree is rendered as a 3D tree, but all
descendant subtrees are rendered as 2D semicircular trees (keeping with a
botanical metaphor; these are rendered to look something like the planar
leaves of a fan palm). Navigation to subtrees in this scheme uses a
different metaphor: selecting subtrees maximizes a subtree’s fan, display-
ing it in the same plane as its parent subtree fan, allowing a user to see
several hierarchical levels at once.

A collection of 2D digital images and/or 3D surface models can be
associated with any leaf in the tree. Arranged in a ‘homology array’,
images at the same spatial position in different leaves can thus represent

a homologous trait. To provide phylogenetic context deeper in the tree,
sample images from the image collections of the leaves are displayed in
image boxes rendered at internal nodes of the hierarchy. This provides
cues to the content of subtrees that can encompass a large subset of leaves
(Fig. 1). Thus, compared with other programs that allow imbedded
images, Ceiba offers two advantages: (i) rendering automatically collated
image collection summaries at internal nodes, and (ii) imbedding of
images at leaves in a 3D visualization that naturally lessens the impacts
of image occlusion.

Although a few programs are scalable to the same degree and can
incorporate images (e.g. Archaeopteryx: http://www.phylosoft.org/
archaeopteryx/; Block et al., 2012 and Supplementary Table Sl), Ceiba
uses a number of techniques to integrate this scalability with imbedded
images. Many of these take advantage of the hierarchical decomposition
of the tree to avoid expensive layout computation and rendering oper-
ations (of both trees and images) until they are needed. Culling is used
extensively, and an optional image caching strategy is implemented in
which recently visited but no longer visible images are freed from
memory.

3 RESULTS

Scalability of Ceiba was evaluated in depth on two large trees
included in the software distribution (839 and 55 473 leaves).
To evaluate what a user would experience in a lengthy interactive
session, the program was run in ‘tour’ mode, an animation that

visits every subtree, rendering all image collections in turn.
Performance with 2D images was tested by spooﬁng the program
into fetching a single reference 1.25 MB image ﬁle for every leaf.
A tour of the default decomposition of the 55473 taxon tree of
Smith et al. (2011) visited all 2580 subtrees containing 55473 2D
images with no apparent degradation of graphics performance,
and with memory requirements (image caching enabled) never
exceeding 0.6 GB of RAM. A 3D surface model with 330000
polygons was attached to each of the leaves in the 839 taxon tree,
and a comparable tour could be completed by allowing some
degradation in the smoothness of the animation.

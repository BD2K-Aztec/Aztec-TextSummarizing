Abstract

Summary: Elucidation of human disease similarities has provided new insights into etiology, dis—
ease classification and drug repositioning. Since dysfunctional regulation would be manifested as
the decoupling of expression correlation, disease similarity (DS) in terms of dysfunctional regula—
tion mechanism (DRM) could be estimated by using a differential coexpression based approach,
which is described in a companion paper. Due to the lack of tools for estimating BS from the view—
point of DRM in public domain, we implemented an R package 'DSviaDRM’ to identify significant
DS via DRM based on transcriptomic data. DSviaDRM contains five easy—to—use functions, DCEA,
DCpathway, DS, comDCGL and comDCGLp/ot, for identifying disease relationships and showing
common differential regulation information shared by similar diseases.

Availability and implementation: DSviaDRM is available as an R package, with a user’s guide and
source code, at http://cran.r—project.org/web/packages/DSviaDRM/index.htm|.

1 Introduction

Disease similarity (DS) study has emerged as an active research area,
which helps to systematically investigate etiology, pathogenesis and
even perform drug repositioning because drug clinical application
can be appropriated from one disease to its similar ones. In recent
years, scientists explored DS based on clinical manifestations
(Robinson et (11., 2008), electronic medical records (Blair et (11.,
2013), disease—related genes (Goh et (11., 2007) and disease—related
differentially expressed genes (Suthram et (11., 2010). Accordingly,
several analysis tools and databases have been released to detect dis—
ease relationships, such as DOSim (Li et (11., 2011), DiseaseConnect
(Liu et (11., 2014), Human Phenotype Ontology (Robinson et (11.,
2008), Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (Davis et (11., 2013)
and MalaCards (Rappaport et (11., 2013). It has been realized that

although clinical manifestations and electronic medical records sup—
ply valuable information for estimating DS, it is hard to unravel
underlying mechanisms hidden in disease relationships. While, the
disease relationships generated from disease—related genes/pathways
are inevitably biased to well—studied diseases and thus offer limited
chance to discover novel findings.

It has been well established that diseases are highly correlated to
the rewiring of gene regulatory network or dysfunctional regulation,
and differential coexpression analysis (DCEA) has proved to be use—
ful in exploring potential differential regulation mechanism (i.e. dys—
functional regulation mechanism, DRM; de la Fuente, 2010; Liu
et (11., 2010; Yu et (11., 2011). In this sense, DCEA became a valuable
complement to traditional differential expression analysis (DEA) in
the field of transcriptomics. We have found that DCEA—based

disease relationships are more relevant to pathogenic mechanisms
than DEA—based ones, which is reported in a companion paper
(Yang et al. submitted to Biology Direct, under the 1St revision). In
this work, we developed an R package, DSviaDRM, implementing
our novel approach for estimating DS via DRM and visualizing
common DRMs shared by similar diseases.

2 Description

2.1 Design and methods

Figure 1 shows the overall design and main outputs of DSviaDRM.
First, DCEA carries out differential coexpression analyses at both
gene level and gene pair level (Liu et (11., 2010; Yang et (11., 2013; Yu
et (11., 2011). Second, DCpat/oway transforms the calculation results
from gene level to pathway level, based on which DS estimates dis—
ease similarities and outputs significantly similar diseases in the form
of a disease network. Then, comDCGL extracts common differen—
tially coexpressed genes (DCGs) and differentially coexpressed links/
pairs (DCLs) shared by similar diseases. Finally, by integrating tran—
scriptional regulation information, the common DCGs and DCLs are
presented as a gene network via comDCGLplot. Following this
architecture, we introduce the above five functions one by one.

DCEA: DCEA includes DCp and DCe methods which were de—
veloped in our previous works to identify DCGs and DCLs (Liu et (11.,
2010; Yang et (11., 2013; Yu et (11., 2011). DCp calculates differential
coexpression values (dC) of N genes for M diseases, as well as their p—
and 11— values; while DCe calculates correlation values of P gene pairs
for M diseases, and their 17—, q—values (see the Supplementary File for
more algorithmic information of DCp and DCe).

DCpat/oway: DCpat/oway includes a pathway library which
comes from MSigDB and involves 6176 pathways and 21 075 genes.
By calculating the dC of a pathway as the average dC of its compo—
nent genes, DCpat/oway outputs the dC values of 6176 pathways for
each disease as shown in Figure 1.

DS: DS is the core of the whole package. It computes the partial
correlation coefficients of pathways’ dCs between any two diseases
as their DS measure. Partial correlation coefficient (Eq. 1) is evoked
from an R package, ppcor.

ny.z :

Here ex“ is the partial correlation coefficient of x and y with a third
constant variable, z. cxy, cxz and 6,1 are the correlation coefficients
among x, y and z.

A permutation test is performed to evaluate the statistical signifi—
cance of observed correlation coefficients, which randomly re—as—
signs the affiliation of gene to pathway with three values unchanged:
(i) the number of pathways, (ii) the number of each pathway’s com—
ponent genes, (iii) the number of pathways a given gene belongs to,
and re—calculates the pathways’ dCs and partial correlation coeffi—
cients between every possible disease pairs. The resulting pseudo
partial correlation coefficients form an empirical null distribution,
from which the p—value and FDR value (i.e. q—value) can be esti—
mated, and thus significantly similar diseases can be identified ac—
cording to a user—defined cutoff.

Finally, significant disease relationships are displayed as a net—
work, with nodes representing diseases, red lines representing posi—
tively correlated disease relationships, green lines representing
negatively correlated relationships, as shown in Figure 1. It is note
that when disease A and A’ form a negative link, the patient with
disease A tends to be protected from having disease A’ and vice

DCpathway, DS, comDCGL and camDCGLp/ot functions. In comDCGL, (IO 7

versa, which is probably due to the inversely regulated biological
processes involved in the two negatively correlated diseases (Hu and
Agarwal, 2009). We also propose that an anti—A drug may have an
undesired property of inducing disease A’ when the drug is inversing
its target processes (Yang et al. submitted to Biology Direct, under
the 1St revision, see supplementary file).

comDCGL: comDCGL sorts out common DCGs and DCLs shared
by similar diseases. Their corresponding dC values (for DCGs) and cor—
relation values (for DCLs) are also displayed. Since DCGs and DCLs
imply the rewiring of gene regulatory mechanism, DCGs and DCLs are
highlighted with regulation information in the TFZtarget library which
includes 199 950 binary tuples of transcription factor (TF)—to—target, as
DRA module does in DCGL package (Yang et (11., 2013).

comDCGLplot: To provide an intuitive illustration of the com—
mon mechanisms shared by similar diseases, comDCGLplot visual—
izes a DCL—centered gene network with squared pink node
indicating DCG TF, squared blue node indicating non—DCG TF, cir—
cle pink node representing DCG target, circle blue node representing
non—DCG target, line with arrow indicating regulation relation DCL
and line without arrow indicating non—regulation relation DCL, still
as DRA does in DCGL package (Yang et (11., 2013).

2.2 Case study on GEO datasets

‘exprsl’, ‘expr52’ and ‘exprs3’ which come from three expression
datasets, GSE22528, GSE35487 and GSE9006 of GEO (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) are included in the package for demon—
strating the functions. ‘exprs1’, ‘exprs2’ and ‘exprs3’ are designed
for Allergic asthma, Chronic kidney disease and Type 2 diabetes
studies, respectively. dC values of genes and pathways for three
datasets were obtained by using DCEA and DCpat/oway. DS results
indicated that Allergic asthma and Chronic kidney disease, Chronic
kidney disease and Type 2 diabetes are significantly correlated, re—
spectively. comDCGL sorted out 14 shared DCGs and 1 shared
DCL with known regulation information, which were plotted by
comDCGLplot (supplementary file).

DSviaDRM generally expect gene expression matrices (with genes
in rows and samples in columns in disease and normal samples) as
a major input, the key output are disease pairs ranked by p—value
and a network composed of significant disease relationships.
Furthermore, DSviaDRM is able to identify and display common
dysregulation information shared by similar diseases.

DSviaDRM is the first tool to exploit DS based on DRM. It fa—
cilitates the analysis of DS study and helps to systematically investi—
gate diseases’ etiology and pathogenesis, perform drug repositioning
and design novel therapeutic interventions.

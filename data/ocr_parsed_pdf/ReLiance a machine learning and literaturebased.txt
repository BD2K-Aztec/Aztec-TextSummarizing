ABSTRACT

Motivation: The prediction of receptor—ligand pairings is an
important area of research as intercellular communications are
mediated by the successful interaction of these key proteins. As
the exhaustive assaying of receptor—ligand pairs is impractical,
a computational approach to predict pairings is necessary. We
propose a workflow to carry out this interaction prediction task,
using a text mining approach in conjunction with a state of the art
prediction method, as well as a widely accessible and comprehensive
dataset.

Among several modern classifiers, random forests have been
found to be the best at this prediction task. The training of this
classifier was carried out using an experimentally validated dataset
of Database of Ligand-Receptor Partners (DLRP) receptor—ligand
pairs. New examples, co-cited with the training receptors and
ligands, are then classified using the trained classifier. After applying
our method, we find that we are able to successfully predict
receptor—ligand pairs within the GPCR family with a balanced
accuracy of 0.96. Upon further inspection, we find several supported
interactions that were not present in the Database of Interacting
Proteins (DlPdatabase).

We have measured the balanced accuracy of our method
resulting in high quality predictions stored in the available database
ReLiance.

1 INTRODUCTION

The ‘omics’ era has presented tremendous opportunities for high-
throughput investigations into important questions facing the
research community. Many investigative strategies of implementing
data mining techniques in combination with high throughput
experiments have accomplished much. Several of these high-
throughput experimental methods, yeast two-hybrid systems—Y2H
(Ito et (11., 2001), pull-down assays (Vikis and Guan, 2004), tandem
afﬁnity puriﬁcation (Puig et (11., 2001), mass spectrometry (Gavin

et (11., 2002; Puig et (11., 2001), microarrays (Stoll et (11., 2005) and
phage display (Willats, 2002), have all generated enormous datasets,
yet they are incomplete and are composed of many false positives
and false negatives.

Several databases exist to store information about validated
or predicted protein—protein interactions (PPI). They include
the Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences—MIPS
database (Mewes et (11., 2004), the Molecular Interactions—MINT
database (Zanzoni et (11., 2002) the IntAct database (Kerrien et (11.,
2007), the Database of Interacting Proteins—DIP (Xenarios et (11.,
2000), the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database—BIND
(Bader et (11., 2001) and the BioGRID database (Stark et (11., 2006).
Some, like the Yeast Proteome Database (Hodges et (11., 1999)
contain interactions which are derived from wet lab results, as well
as those curated from literary sources.

Currently, there exists thousands of candidate receptors and
ligands and potentially hundreds of thousands of interactions. As the
exhaustive assaying of every possible receptor—ligand pairs is
impractical, a computational approach to the prediction task is
necessary. For example, Gertz et (11. (2003) created a receptor—
ligand matching algorithm for the chemokine and tgfﬂ families.
Later, we more aptly matched the tgfﬂ family with kernels (Gertz
et (11., 2003; Iacucci et (11., 2011) with an increase in recall of 0.76
over the 0.44 obtained from the results of Gertz et (11. Following
this, we have benchmarked several machine learning techniques,
and assayed several parameters, on the receptor—ligand interaction
prediction task (Iacucci et (11., submitted for publication). The results
of this work show that we can obtain a balanced accuracy of 0.84
in this prediction task.

Having used a ‘golden standard’ (Graeber and Eisenberg,
2001) to determine which is the best machine learning technique
to apply to this problem, we now seek to make in silico
predictions. The starting point of this novel course of research
is the widely applied and powerful ﬁeld of text mining. In
this article, we present a strategy that takes into account text
mining information in conjunction with a popular machine learning
algorithm, the random forest (Qi et (11., 2005), which integrates
several data sources such as domain, expression and phylogenetic-
based evidence.

We build our new candidate list by searching for genes that are
co-cited with the receptors and ligands from the DLRP database
(Graeber and Eisenberg, 2001). We then make predictions using our
trained classiﬁer and evaluate the results in terms of known pairs,
as well as in terms of distribution of the co-citations in our ranked
list of predictions.

Fig. 1. Family analysis. Candidates from the new examples where mapped to Gene Ontology and a search was performed for classiﬁcations containing the
term ‘receptor’ with more than ﬁve members. The three classiﬁcations resulting from this search criteria were ‘Peptide Receptor Activity, G-protein Coupled’,
‘Transmembrane Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Activity’ and ‘Cytokine Receptor Activity’. We then used the DIP database as a baseline for calculations of

sensitivity, speciﬁcity and balanced accuracy for each classiﬁcation

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview

We propose a pertinent process (Fig. 1) to carry out this prediction
task, using a state-of-the-art prediction method and an accessible and
comprehensive dataset. Among several classiﬁers, random forests have
previously been identiﬁed to work best for this prediction task (Iacucci
et 111., submitted for publication). The training of this classiﬁer was carried
out using an experimentally validated dataset of receptoriligand pairs
(Graeber and Eisenberg, 2001). New examples are then classiﬁed using
the trained classiﬁer. The process begins with the collection of candidate
genes to enter as new examples to our trained classiﬁer. The new examples
may be derived in a variety of ways (an up-regulated gene list, genes
that contain a speciﬁc protein domain, protein-array experimentation).
In our setting, we look at genes that are co-cited with the receptors
and ligands from the DLRP database. The DLRP was constructed using
experimentally determined 1i gand-receptor cognate pairs through a literature
review. The database contains 314 proteins, 210 of which are used in our
training set.

2.2 Creation of the candidate list

We created a candidate list by taking the 210 receptors and the ligands in the
DLRP database (Graeber and Eisenberg, 2001) and ﬁnding all the co-cited
genes [using the text mining track of the STRING database (Von Mering
et (11., 2007)] for which all the information from all the data sources was
available. In total, 483 candidates form this list.

2.3 Data sources

The data were collected and processed as reported in Iacucci et al. (submitted
for publication). Brieﬂy, proﬁles associated to genes were retrieved from
various databases [i.e. Kegg, Interpro, Toucan, (Aerts et (11., 2005; Hunter
et (11., 2009)]. These proﬁles are vectors of measurements, which represent
the candidate ligand or receptor. We create a feature value for each
candidate receptoriligand pair by taking the two vectors and applying a
pairwise similarity measure (cosine, mutual information, absolute correlation
coefﬁcient, jaccardi coefﬁcient) to them. This value is now the feature value
that corresponds to the similarity between each ligand and receptor. The
feature values which arise from the use of the various sources are then
inputted into our random forest.

These proﬁles contained between 79 (expression data) and 674 features
(domain data) depending on the data source being considered. For the
phylogenetic vector, complete protein sequences were retrieved for seven
species (Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Homo mpiens, Pan troglodytes,
Cam's familiaris, Cavia porcellus and Bos taurus) from EnsEMBL build
51 (Hubbard et (11., 2009). Sequences were then aligned using ClustalW
(Thompson et (11., 1994) to detect orthology. The gene expression proﬁles
were retrieved from the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research
Foundation (GNF) human expression atlas (Su et (11., 2004). Each proﬁle
contains 79 values corresponding to the 79 conditions considered by (Su
et (11., 2004). The domain information is retrieved from the InterPro database
(Hunter et (11., 2009), through EnsEMBL. Only the domains present in at
least one of the 210 receptors and ligands considered are kept for further
analysis. The motif data was created using the Toucan toolbox to search

for putative motifs in the upstream sequence of the genes. Each protein is
then represented by a vector of size 674. Each value represents the score
of the corresponding motif for the given protein. The pathway data were
retrieved from the Kegg Pathway database (Aerts at (11., 2005). Only the
pathways in which at least one of the 210 training example receptors and
ligands is involved are used to build the ﬁnal proﬁles. This means that, in the
case of Kegg, candidate proteins are represented by sparse binary vectors of
size 314.

2.4 Classiﬁer

Following our previous work, we selected the method that provides the best
balanced accuracy (Iacucci at (11., submitted for publication). This method
was found to be the random forest with a balanced accuracy of 0.84 (Iacucci
at (11., submitted for publication). We used the best performing similarly
measures for each data source (domain, phylogeneticiabsolute correlation
coefﬁcient; expression, kegg, motifiabsolute cosine). Our classiﬁer was
trained using the DLRP dataset described previously (Graeber and Eisenberg,
2001). We applied Matlab 2010a implementation of random forest (class
TreeBagger) with the number of trees set to 1000 and the number of variables
to select at random for each decision split set to default value (square root of
number of variables). To achieve stability in the prioritized lists, the algorithm
has been trained and tested 200 times, after which the new predictions
were assigned by averaging scores. The running time for this procedure
was ~2h.

The candidate list was inputted into the trained classiﬁer (trained and
calibrated as described above). Each possible receptoriligand pair was
classiﬁed as interacting or noninteracting and was ranked according to a score
assigned by algorithmithat is, the probability of observation belonging to
particular class given as fraction of observations of that class in predicted
leafs across the ensemble. The resulting list is of size 116 403 with 7521
positive predictions, 108 882 negative predictions and 7958 predictions for
which co-citations exist.

2.5 Co-citation and receptor family analysis

Co-citation values were downloaded from text mining track of the STRING
database (Von Mering at (11., 2007). The normalized co-citation score is
the total number of co-citations for the members of a bin divided by the
connectivity score for the members of a bin and then scaled to the maximum
value across all bins. The co-citation analysis was performed by comparison
of the ranked results with the co-citation score. In order to assess the
biological relevance of our work in terms of individual receptor families,
we map our candidates to Gene Ontology (GO) classiﬁcations and examine
the performance of our predictions to individual receptor families. Gene
Ontology analysis was carried out by mapping the candidate list to gene
ontology classiﬁcations that contained the word ‘receptor’ and had more
than ﬁve members. Three classiﬁcations resulted from this search criteria
(‘Peptide Receptor Activity, G-protein Coupled’, ‘Transmembrane Receptor
Tyrosine Kinase Activity’ and ‘Cytokine Receptor Activity’). The predictions
from our method were then assessed using the members of each of these
classiﬁcations by comparing our predictions with the interactions reported in
the DIP (Xenarios 21111., 2000) database for these classiﬁcations as it is known
to contain experimentally validated receptoriligand pairings (Graeber and
Eisenberg, 2001).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Evaluating the results of our predictions can be challenging, as the
overall objective of our work is to predict novel receptor—ligand
pairs, yet the merits of this work must be measured using known
interactions. In order to address this, we look at the qualitative aspect
of the co-citation proﬁle of the ranked predictions. Furthermore, we
look at the receptor classiﬁcations of Gene Ontology and assess

into 100 ranked bins of size 1164. On the left we see the ranked bins that have
a length corresponding to their normalized co-citation score. The normalized
co-citation score is the total number of co-citations for the members of a bin
divided by the connectivity score for the members of a bin and then scaled
to the maximum value across all bins. The bins colored in red correspond to
the bins that contain pairs, which are called a positive by our classiﬁer. On
the right, we see the ranked bins that have a length corresponding to their
connectivity score. The connectivity score is the total number of edge degree
(number of predicted interactors in the genome) of each of the members of
the bin. The dark blue bins correspond to bins, which contain members with
higher connectivity than average. The green dashed lines correspond to the
average value across all bins

our ability to make predictions in terms of sensitivity, speciﬁcity
and balanced accuracy with respect to the known DIP interactions
for these families. Finally, we assess the predictions one-by-one by
examining the top ten predictions in the different quarters of the
ranked predictions.

3.1 Co-citation analysis

Assuming co-citation should positively correlate with correct pairing
of candidate pairs, we examine the predicted prioritized candidate
list in terms of co-citation. The overall shape of the prioritized
candidate list (Fig. 2) suggests that the performance of our workﬂow
is consistent with an accurate classiﬁcation strategy. Looking at
Figure 2, we see the 100 ranked bins containing the co-citation
values for the prioritized list. Looking at the top six bins, we ﬁnd
that there is a peak in co-citation, suggesting an overall positive

Fig. 3. Workﬂow. The trained classiﬁer is provided with new examples (genes which are co-cited with the receptors and ligands from the DLRP database)
and makes predictions based on its ability to distinguish between interacting and noninteracting pairs. The predictions are ranked by the random forest score

provided by the class

prediction area. Indeed, if we examine the ﬁrst quarter of the bins,
we see that there is an enrichment of co-cited terms as they are higher
than the average level (value 0.4035), which one would expect to see
if the co-citations were uniformly distributed (P-value <0.05 when
applying a t-test between the ﬁrst and second quarters). Looking
at the second and third quarters, we see a depletion of co-cited
terms in those bins, whereas the fourth quarter contains levels of
co-citation close to the average level. This plot suggests that our
classiﬁer is able to learn the structure in the data of interacting
receptors and ligands, as well as noninteracting pairs, thus explaining
the enriched and depleted areas of the plot (P-value <0.05 when
applying a t-test between the ﬁrst and second quarters). The bins
toward the end of the ranking, which measured at about the average
level, suggest that a low classiﬁer score is assigned to pairs that
show structure related to neither interacting nor noninteracting pairs.
In fact, we examined these pairs and found that they were highly
connected relative to the rest of the list, suggesting that the classiﬁer
could better identify pairs with where the candidate ligand and
receptor had fewer, speciﬁc interactions and not more promiscuous
proteins.

3.2 Receptor Family analysis

In order to ﬁnd areas of high competency in our prioritization, we
map the candidates to Gene Ontology [using DAVID (Dennis, Jr.
et (11., 2003)] and perform a search for classiﬁcations containing
the term ‘receptor’ and found three classiﬁcations with more than
ﬁve members (Fig. 3). The three classiﬁcations resulting from this
search criteria were ‘Peptide Receptor Activity, G-protein Coupled’,
‘Transmembrane Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Activity’ and ‘Cytokine
Receptor Activity’. We then used the DIP database as a baseline
for calculations of sensitivity, speciﬁcity and balanced accuracy
for each classiﬁcation. More speciﬁcally, we take the candidates
from our experiment that are mapped to these classiﬁcations and
compare our positive predictions with those reported in the DIP

database. We ﬁnd that we are able to successfully predict receptor—
ligand pairs within the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) family
with a balanced accuracy of 0.96. The GPCR family represents
the most important group of current drug targets because 40% of
all modern medicinal drugs are GPCR related (Overington et (11.,
2006) (e.g. imatinib, cetirizine, hydroxyzine and acebutolol). This
is no surprise as they are key agents in several diseases (Overington
et (11., 2006) (e.g. WHIM syndrome, Retinitis pigmentosa and
Cryptorchidism). We searched our results for novel interactions that
were made with members of this family, which did not exist in
the DIP database. We examined the top 10 predictions (Table 1)
from our prioritization involving members of the GPCR family
found several supported interactions such as those between TCF7-
CTNNB 1 (Kerrien et (11., 2007; Mewes et (11., 2004; Xia et (11., 2006),
LEFl-CTNNBl (Bader et (11., 2001; Goel et (11., 2012; Mewes et (11.,
2004; Stark et (11., 2006) and ANGPT2-F2R (Kerrien et (11., 2007).
In addition, we ﬁnd high STRING (Von Mering et (11., 2007) scores
for the following interactions CCL22-CCR1, CXCL13-CCR1 and
CCL22-CX3CR1. Notably, we found that two of these novel in
silico predictions (CXCL13-CCR1 and CCL22-CX3CR1) showed
experimental evidence of interaction (Booth et (11., 2008; Hoglund
et (11., 2011).

3.3 Qualitative analysis

We examine the 10 co-cited predictions made at the top of each
quarter of our ranking and ﬁnd that the several of the predictions
made at the top of the 1st quarter were supported (Table 2).
Among these interacts are those between CD3G-CD3D (Goel et (11.,
2012; Kerrien et (11., 2007; Mewes et (11., 2004; Stark et (11.,
2006), B2M-CALR (Goel et (11., 2012; Kerrien et (11., 2007; Mewes
et (11., 2004; Stark et (11., 2006), CDC14A-CDC7 (Kerrien et (11.,
2007), PDGFRB-GRB7 (Goel et (11., 2012; Mewes et (11., 2004)
and SMAD7-ACVRL1 (Kerrien et (11., 2007). The second and
third quarters (which were below the threshold of a positive call
in the algorithm) contain predictions that were not supported.

The remaining, fourth quarter contained three supported interactions
(Supplementary Tables 1, 2 and 3). The interactions present in
the fourth quarter are due to the highly connected nature of the
interacting receptors and ligands that are assigned low scores (as
described above).

3.4 ReLiance database

The ReLiance database is available at: http://homes.esat.kuleuven.
be/~bioiuser/ReLianceDB/index.php. Among the information
accessible from the database are the putative protein partner, the
score for our prediction, as well as other pertinent information (hugo
names, swissprot ids, PDB entries, etc.). The database entries are
annotated and enriched on-the-ﬂy using the reﬂect API (Paﬁlis et (11.,
2009).

A mouse-click ﬁinction is applied to the highlighted proteins and
genes to generate informative pop-up windows hosting information
where the speciﬁc bioentities from public databases are summarized.

Thus, links to the synonyms, the complete sequence of the longest
transcript, domains from the Simple Modular Architecture Research
Foundation (SMART) (Letunic et (11., 2006) database, the PDBsum
(Laskowski, 2001) structure, the interactions from STITCH (Kuhn
et (11., 2008), the known subcellular location and the source organism
are shown, respectively. Most of these features on the pop-up are
hyperlinked to related database entries.

In addition, Medline abstracts concerning the bioentity are offered
by the iHOP (Hoffmann and Valencia, 2004) service. Similar
functionality can be offered by OnTheFly (Pavlopoulos et (11., 2009)
service for a more targeted search as selected results can be stored
locally and then annotated. This way, in terms of data integration
and identiﬁer updates, the database can always be up to date and
supported by the Reﬂects and OnThFly’s dictionary.

Networks showing the interaction partners can dynamically be
explored by the Medusa application (Pavlopoulos et (11., 2011) that
runs as an applet on our site. Force-directed layout algorithms
provide intuitive layouts, whereas the color scheme encodes certain
information. The ‘purple’ node represents the query protein, the
‘red’ nodes correspond to the predicted partner proteins which are
also co-cited to the query protein and ‘yellow’ nodes correspond to
the predicted partner proteins that are not co-cited with the query
protein.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Our workﬂow to carry out the receptor—ligand pairing prediction
task provides several ﬁndings. Using a text mining approach in
conjunction with a state of the art prediction method, as well as
a widely accessible and comprehensive dataset, we have produced
a prioritized list that is consistent with a successful classiﬁcation
scenario. In addition, we ﬁnd that we are able to successﬁilly predict
receptor—ligand pairs within the GPCR family with a balanced
accuracy of 0.96. We introduce ReLiance, our database for predicted
receptor—ligand pairings which provides high data integration and
visualization capabilities.

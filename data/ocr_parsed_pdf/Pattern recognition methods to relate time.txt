Abstract

Motivation: Comparing time courses of gene expression with time courses of phenotypic data may
provide new insights in cellular mechanisms. In this study, we compared the performance of five
pattern recognition methods with respect to their ability to relate genes and phenotypic data: one
classical method (k—means) and four methods especially developed for time series [Short Time—ser—
ies Expression Miner (STEM), Linear Mixed Model mixtures, Dynamic Time Warping for —Omics and
linear modeling with R/Bioconductor limma package]. The methods were evaluated using data
available from toxicological studies that had the aim to relate gene expression with phenotypic end—
points (i.e. to develop biomarkers for adverse outcomes). Additionally, technical aspects (influence
of noise, number of time points and number of replicates) were evaluated on simulated data.
Results: None of the methods outperforms the others in terms of biology. Linear modeling with
limma is mostly influenced by noise. STEM is mostly influenced by the number of biological repli—
cates in the dataset, whereas k—means and linear modeling with limma are mostly influenced by
the number of time points. In most cases, the results of the methods complement each other.
We therefore provide recommendations to integrate the five methods.

Availability: The Matlab code for the simulations performed in this research is available in the
Supplementary Data (Word file). The microarray data analysed in this paper are available at
ArrayExpress (E—TOXM—22 and E—TOXM—23) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE39291). The phe—

present study focuses on comparing time courses of gene expression
with time courses of phenotypic data, also called phenotypic anchor—
ing of gene expression data. Phenotypic anchoring may provide add—
itional insight in the response to perturbations that cannot be
generated by analyzing gene expression alone. Various statistical
tools can be used for phenotypic anchoring (Ganter et al., 2008),
including pattern recognition.

Pattern recognition includes clustering (e.g. k—means), classi—
fication (e.g. support vector machines) and model reduction
(e.g. principal component analysis) (de Ridder et al., 2013).
Biological entities belonging to the same cluster are assumed to be
functionally related (Bar—Joseph, 2004; Liao, 2005).

In this study, five representative pattern recognition methods
were chosen. First, we included a clustering method that is able to
remove random patterns, called Short Time—series Expression Miner
(STEM). Removing random patterns is important for datasets with
a high number of variables compared with the number of time
points (Ernst and Bar—Joseph, 2006). Secondly, Dynamic Time
Warping for —Omics (DTW4omics), a method that takes into ac—
count time delays in biological processes (Cavill et al., 2013), is con—
sidered. In contrast to clustering methods (which treat all variables
in the dataset as equivalent entities), DTW4omics treats the pheno—
typic data as predefined profiles and searches for genes matching
these profiles using a distance metric. Thirdly, Linear Mixed Model
(LMM) mixtures, a clustering method correcting for variability be—
tween replicates (Celeux et al., 2005), is discussed. Furthermore, we
applied k—means, a classical clustering method for static data.
Finally, we used a regression method [linear modeling with the
R/Bioconductor package limma (Ritchie et al., 2015 H, to find rela—
tionships between gene expression and phenotypic endpoints.

The five methods were compared with respect to their ability to
extract functionally related groups of genes, their sensitivity to
measurement noise, the influence of the number of time points and
the influence of the number of biological replicates. The technical
aspects (influence of noise, number of time points and number of
replicates) were evaluated on simulated data, mimicking real expres—
sion and phenotypic data. The biological outcome was evaluated ex—
ploiting two public datasets from toxicogenomics.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Pattern recognition methods

In this study, both simulated and real datasets were analyzed by
means of STEM, DT\W40mics, LMM mixtures, k—means and linear
modeling with limma. Table 1 gives an overview of the properties
of the four methods. Calculations were performed in R (http://www.
r—project.org/), except for STEM, which is a Java application.

2.1.1 Short time-series expression miner
STEM (Ernst and Bar—Joseph, 2006) is a freely available Java tool
(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jernst/stemI) for clustering time profiles

that run in parallel. STEM distinguishes between real and random
patterns in time series by identifying time profiles that are signifi—
cantly present in the dataset. Significance is determined by permuta—
tion testing. Phenotypic endpoints were treated as genes and added
to the study. Opposite time profiles of phenotypic endpoints were
also added to the study in order to determine negative relationships
between genes and phenotypic endpoints. The variables in the
dataset (genes, phenotypic endpoints) are assigned to the significant
profiles based on similarity (positive correlation). Genes assigned to
the same profile as a phenotypic endpoint are assumed to be related
to that endpoint. The STEM clustering algorithm is described in
detail by Ernst and coworkers (Ernst et al., 2005 ). STEM has been
previously applied to cluster toxicogenomics time profiles (Alm
et al., 2009; Briede et al., 2010; Hebels et al., 2013). In this study
parameters for STEM were taken as described in previous work
(Briede et al., 2010).

2.1.2 Dynamic time warping for —omics

DTW40mics is publicly available in—house R code (http://web.tgx.
unimaas.nl/svn/public/dtw/) to detect similar patterns on different
time scales, due to delays or differences in speed (Cavill et al.,
2013). For each endpoint, a list of significant genes (false discovery
rate <0.05) is produced based on the calculation of the optimal dis—
tance between time profiles and permutation testing. All genes in
this list are supposed to be positively related to that endpoint. To de—
termine negative relationships, we repeat the previous steps for the
opposite time profiles of the phenotypic endpoints. DTW40mics
uses the distance function from the DTW package described by
Giorgino and coworkers (Giorgino, 2009).

2.1.3 LMM mixtures

LMM mixtures is a model—based method for clustering time series
that run in parallel, taking into account variability between repli—
cates (Celeux et al., 2002). Phenotypic endpoints were treated as
genes and added to the study. Opposite time profiles of phenotypic
endpoints were also added to the study in order to determine nega—
tive relationships between genes and phenotypic endpoints. LMM
mixtures divide the dataset in an optimal number of clusters. For
each cluster, the average profile for the cluster is described by a
LMM, with the times as fixed effects and variability between repli—
cates as random effect. Genes assigned to the same cluster as a
phenotypic endpoint (respectively, the opposite profile of a pheno—
typic endpoint) are assumed to be positively (respectively, nega—
tively) related to that endpoint. The optimal number of clusters is
determined using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and
maximum—likelihood parameters are iteratively determined by an
optimization algorithm (Celeux et al., 2005 ). To determine a start—
ing value for the optimization algorithm for LMM mixtures, spec—
tral clustering (Ng et al., 2001) was applied. Using the cluster
solution from spectral clustering has previously been reported as an
efficient initialization strategy for LMM mixtures (Scharl et al.,
2010). Spectral clustering was performed in R using the ‘specc’ func—
tion of the ‘kernlab’ package (Zeileis et al., 2004). The mixture of
LMM was fitted with the ‘FLXMlem’ interface of the ‘flexmix’
package (Grun and Leisch, 2008; Leisch, 2004). Both R packages
are available on the CRAN website (http://cran.r—project.org).

2.1.4 k-Means clustering

Phenotypic endpoints were treated as genes and added to the study.
Opposite time profiles of phenotypic endpoints were also added to
the study in order to determine negative relationships between genes

and phenotypic endpoints. k—Means then clusters profiles with an it—
erative optimization algorithm that minimizes within—cluster vari—
ability, while maximizing between—cluster variability (Kintigh and
Ammerman, 1982; Liao, 2005). Each cluster is represented by its
cluster center. Genes assigned to the same cluster as a phenotypic
endpoint (respectively, the opposite profile of a phenotypic end—
point) are assumed to be positively (respectively, negatively) related
to that endpoint. The optimal number of clusters is selected based
on the sum of squared error (SSE), the sum of squared distances be—
tween cluster members and center (Kintigh and Ammerman, 1982).
The optimal solution was calculated in R using the code available at
http://www.mattpeeples.net/kmeans.html and is the number of clus—
ters for which the SSE for the original data differs the most from the
average SSE for 250 random datasets. k—Means was performed in R
using the source code available at http://www.mattpeeples.net/
kmeans.html, which uses the ‘kmeans’ function of the ‘stats’ pack—
age (http://cran.r—project.org).

2.1.5 Linear modeling with limma

For each phenotypic endpoint, genes that vary with that endpoint
were determined by fitting a LMM to the gene expression data using
the R/Bioconductor package limma (Ritchie et al., 2015) (www.bio
conductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html). Time, treat—
ment (exposed versus control) and the phenotypic endpoint were
taken as fixed effect, and replicates as random effect in the model.
Using the phenotypic endpoint as a contrast (coefficient in the linear
model), limma tests which genes vary significantly with the pheno—
typic endpoint. A cut—off value of 0.05 was taken for the false dis—
covery rate. The regression coefficients for the endpoints determine
whether the relationships are positive or negative.

2.2 Simulated data

Performance of statistical methods can be evaluated by checking
whether the results correspond with prior biological knowledge.
However, often our knowledge about the underlying biology is in—
complete. In this case, computer simulations are very useful to assess
how well a method works (Mendes et al., 2003). Here, the influence
on the results of making changes, for example adding noise, to a ref—
erence dataset is studied.

2.2.1 Simulation method

We simulated datasets with properties of microarray data in
Matlab® Version 8.1.0. (r2013a) (copyright©, 1984—2013, The
Mathworks Inc.) applying the method described by Mendes and
coworkers (Mendes et al., 2003) and on the companion website of
Nykter et al. (2006) (http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/csb/mamodel/).
Thousand variables were generated for 10 time points. Each variable
in the dataset is described by a differential equation including rate
constants, affinity constants and Hill coefficients as parameters.
After simulating control samples, a perturbation was simulated by
changing one of the rate constants. Three biological replicates were
generated for both control and perturbation by adding small ran—
dom variables to the affinity constants and Hill coefficients. The ref—
erence dataset consisted of the log2—ratios for the three biological
replicates. Clusters of variables relating to variables 996—1000 were
determined applying the four pattern recognition methods, so vari—
ables 996—1000 are considered to be the endpoints. The influence of
measurement noise was studied by successively adding 15%, 20%
and 25% Gaussian noise to the reference data and comparing the so—
lutions for the pattern recognition methods with the solutions for
the reference dataset. Results of the reference dataset were also

compared with pattern recognition results when using less time
points (the first eight and six time points) and when using only two
biological replicates instead of three. Table 2 presents an overview
of the simulated data. More details about the simulation and the
Matlab code are provided in the Supplementary Data, Section 1.

2.2.2 Evaluation of pattern recognition methods

The results for the different simulated datasets were compared with
the results obtained from the reference dataset. The accuracy de—
scribes how close the results of the simulation were to the results for
the reference dataset.

2.3 Real datasets

The five pattern recognition methods were applied to two datasets
obtained from the human hepatoma cancer cell line HepG2: after
exposure to either benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), a human carcinogen, or
menadione (vitamin K3), an agent producing reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Both positive and negative associations with particular end—
points were determined.

2.3.1 Response of HepG2 to B(a)P

B(a)P is a carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, having
genotoxic and non—genotoxic properties. B(a)P exposure causes,
among others, oxidative stress, DNA adduct formation and apop—
tosis (van Delft et al., 2010). Sources of exposure are (among others)
wood burning, coal tar, vehicle exhaust and cigarette smoke
(Bostrom et al., 2002). Gene expression and phenotypic endpoints
(DNA adducts, cell cycle, apoptosis indicative of molecular re—
sponses to DNA damage induced by the carcinogen) were measured
at 12 time points after exposure to B(a)P (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30,
36, 48, 54 and 60 h). HepG2 cells were treated with 3 uM B(a)P or
vehicle control. Cell cycle profiles (G1, G2/M and S phase) and
apoptotic cell levels were determined by flow cytometry. DNA ad—
duct levels were determined by 32P post—labeling. Gene expression
was determined with Agilent microarrays, labeled with cyanine 3
(Cy3) and cyanine 5 (Cy5). Two biological experiments were con—
ducted, with two hybridizations per time point for each experiment
(by swapping Cy3 and Cy5). Microarray data are available at
ArrayExpress (E—TOXM—22 and E—TOXM—23). Phenotypic data are
available in the Supplementary Data (Excel file). Detailed informa—
tion about this dataset was described earlier in van Delft et al.
(2010).

2.3.2 Response of HepG2 to menadione

Menadione (vitamin K3) is a compound causing oxidative stress
through the formation of ROS. Oxidative stress has been related to
chemically induced liver injury, chronic liver diseases and

For all five methods studied, pathway and GO analysis of these
gene lists provided pathways and GO terms that have been previ—
ously related with exposure to the particular toxicant or with one of
its adverse outcomes (see Supplementary Material).

The hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000, 2011)
review biological processes related to all types of cancer, and the sig—
naling pathways involved in those biological processes. Those hall—
marks are: (1) sustaining proliferative signaling; (2) evading growth
suppressors; (3) avoiding immune destruction; (4) enabling replica—
tive immortality; (5) tumor—promoting inflammation; (6) activating
invasion and metastasis; (7) inducing angiogenesis; (8) genome in—
stability and mutation; (9) resisting cell death and (10) deregulating
cellular energetics. Because B(a)P is a carcinogen and menadione
causes hepatocellular carcinoma, pathways known to be involved in
the hallmarks of cancer provide biologically relevant hypotheses to
test in follow—up experiments. For B(a)P, in particular signaling
pathways related to DNA damage response are relevant (Bolotina
et al., 2007). Examples are signaling pathways involving p53, NF—
kB and MYC (Bolotina et al., 2007; Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000).
For menadione, pathways related to oxidative stress provide rele—
vant hypotheses. Signaling pathways influenced by oxidative stress
given in Martindale and Holbrook (2002) include pathways
involved in growth arrest, cell proliferation, senescence and apop—
tosis. All five methods provide biologically relevant pathways and
GO terms that are related to the exposure to the toxicant or its ad—
verse outcomes (e.g. cancer, oxidative stress) (see Figs. 2—5 and
Supplementary Material, Section 3). Therefore, in terms of retriev—
ing biologically relevant information, there is no method that out—
performs the others.

If we compare the results of limma, the only regression—based
model in the study, with the results for the other (correlation— and
distance—based) methods, we observe the following. LMM mixtures
positively relate the pathway ‘direct p53 effectors” to DNA adducts,
while limma finds a negative relationship. Four genes of ‘direct p5 3
effectors” are in both the genes lists resulting from LMM mixtures
and limma analysis (PCNA, TNFRSF10B, LIF and BAX), which
means that these four genes have a positive correlation with DNA
adducts, but a negative regression coefficient. This can be explained
as follows. The regression coefficient of the limma model gives the
relationship between gene expression and DNA adducts, when all
other variables in the model (treatment, time) are held constant.
This means that the positive relationship observed by determining
similarities between the time profiles was due to another (confound—
ing) variable. This shows an advantageous property of limma,
namely correcting for confounding factors.

For the menadione dataset (dataset Deferme et al., 2013), limma
cannot find any pathways related to oxidative DNA damage, while
all other methods generate a pathway list. For this dataset, applying
DTW40mics results in detecting some pathways that cannot be
found without time warping. One of these pathways is related to the
hallmarks of cancer (Fig. 4). This shows the relevance of having a
method taking into account time delays.

Applying the methods for phenotypic anchoring described in this
article results in poorly overlapping gene lists. This is a general prob—
lem of clustering algorithms. There are several reasons for the lack
of consistency between methods. First, parameters (optimal number
of clusters, thresholds) are determined by statistical means and not
on biological properties (Swift et al., 2004). Second, differences in
output are due to different intrinsic properties of these methods.
Limma is a regression method, while the other methods are based on
similarity measures (correlation, distance). Other differences in in—
trinsic properties (taking into account time dependencies, delays,

variance; correcting for random patterns) are shown in Table 1. For
static—based methods, several attempts have already been under—
taken to address these issues. WGCNA selects thresholds based on
scale—free topology, a network property previously observed in bio—
logical networks (Zhang and Horvath, 2005 ). Consensus clustering
attempts to combine the different approaches, capturing the advan—
tageous properties of each methods (Swift et al., 2004). However, to
our knowledge, similar attempts have not been undertaken for
methods developed for time series, taking into account time depend—
encies and delays.

In summary, we conclude that all five methods are suitable for
extracting new hypotheses concerning gene—phenotypic endpoint re—
lationships and none of the five methods outperforms the others in
terms of biology. Furthermore, all methods have their limitations.
Because these methods provide complementary results, we recom—
mend developing a method that integrates the results from the differ—
ent methods. A possible way to do this is to calculate a weighted
score for the probability of each gene—endpoint relationship based
on the accuracy of the methods. Simulation experiments can guide
the choice of the weight for each method. For example, because
STEM was highly influenced by the number of biological replicates,
we decrease the weight for STEM when having less replicates. In a
similar way, we can adapt the weight of k—means and limma accord—
ing to the number of time points. We can then multiply the false dis—
covery rate for each pathway with this probability score in order to
correct for inaccuracies due to the low number of replicates and/or
time points.

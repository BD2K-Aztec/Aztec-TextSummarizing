ABSTRACT

Motivation: RNA-seq is a powerful technology for the study of
transcriptome profiles that uses deep-sequencing technologies.
Moreover, it may be used for cellular phenotyping and help
establishing the etiology of diseases characterized by abnormal
splicing patterns. In RNA-Seq, the exact nature of splicing events is
buried in the reads that span exon—exon boundaries. The accurate
and efficient mapping of these reads to the reference genome is a
major challenge.

Results: We developed PASSion, a pattern growth algorithm-based
pipeline for splice site detection in paired-end RNA-Seq reads.
Comparing the performance of PASSion to three existing RNA-Seq
analysis pipelines, TopHat, MapSplice and HMMSplicer, revealed
that PASSion is competitive with these packages. Moreover, the
performance of PASSion is not affected by read length and coverage.
It performs better than the other three approaches when detecting
junctions in highly abundant transcripts. PASSion has the ability
to detect junctions that do not have known splicing motifs, which
cannot be found by the other tools. Of the two public RNA-
Seq datasets, PASSion predicted ~137000 and 173000 splicing
events, of which on average 82% are known junctions annotated
in the Ensembl transcript database and 18% are novel. In addition,
our package can discover differential and shared splicing patterns
among multiple samples.

1 INTRODUCTION

Global transcriptome analyses provide important insights in the
qualitative and quantitative aspects of gene expression. A few
years ago, transcriptome composition was mainly measured using
microarrays. With the development of next-generation sequencing,
a massively parallel transcriptome sequencing technology called

RNA-Seq has been developed and widely applied in transcriptome
proﬁling. Compared with microarrays, RNA-Seq measures the
transcriptome without prior knowledge of genome sequence and
enables the detection of previously unknown transcripts. Moreover,
RNA-seq is more sensitive toward Changes in low abundant
transcripts, and has a much broader dynamic range (’t Hoen et (11.,
2008; van Iterson et (11., 2009).

One of the opportunities offered by RNA-seq is the detection of
(novel) splice isoforms. Splicing is a process in which introns are
excised and the ﬂanking exons are joined to form the mature mRNA.
In eukaryotes, almost all multi-exonic genes undergo alternative
splicing (Fan et (11., 2008; Wang et (11., 2008). Recent studies have
revealed that variations in splicing patterns are associated with
Alzheimer’s (Twine et (11., 2011) and other complex diseases (Wang
and Cooper, 2007). Detection of splicing patterns will therefore not
only contribute to the Characterization of transcript structures but
also help to understand cellular and disease phenotypes.

Discovery of splice junctions using RNA-Seq is mainly achieved
by aligning the reads that span exon—exon junctions to the reference
genome. Current fast aligners such as Bowtie (Langmead et (11.,
2009) and BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) can efﬁciently map reads to
the exon region, but are less efﬁcient in the mapping of reads across
splice junctions.

Recently, many dedicated tools for detection of splice junctions
have been developed. ALEXA-seq (Grifﬁth et (11., 2010) uses an
exon—exon junction database of all possible pairwise connections of
the known exons from Ensembl to assess the expression, differential
expression and alternative expression of known and predicted
transcript isoforms. The obvious limitation is that ALEXA-seq can
only detect junctions between known exons but is not able to detect
alternative transcripts including yet unknown exons.

Other algorithms do not rely on existing transcript annotations.
TopHat (Trapnell et (11., 2009) is one of the pioneers in this
ﬁeld. It ﬁrst builds exon islands and connects the potential exons
using the known splicing motifs (GT—AG, GC—AG, AT—AC), and
ﬁnally realigns previously unmapped reads to the joined parts.
MapSplice (Wang et (11., 2010) ﬁrst splits reads into smaller
segments and then aligns these to the reference genome individually.
A potential junction is detected, if a missing segment can be
reconstructed by the extension of neighboring exonic segments. All
the potential junctions are ﬁnally evaluated by a score based on
anchor signiﬁcance and entropy. HMMSplicer (Dimon et (11., 2010)
ﬁrst splits the reads into two fragments and aligns them separately

to the reference genome. Once a fragment is aligned, a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) is used to detect the most probable splice
position, and ﬁnally all junctions are scored, ﬁltered and divided
into canonical and non-canonical junction sets.

However, these methods have limitations. TopHat cannot detect
junctions with novel splicing motifs since it requires the guidance of
known splice sites to join exons. Both MapSplice and HMMSplicer
divide reads into small segments, and therefore potentially work
better for long reads than for short reads. Both studies showed that
they perform well on lowly expressed genes but are less accurate
on highly abundance transcripts (Dimon et (11., 2010; Wang et (11.,
2010). Moreover, while MapSplice and HMMSplicer are designed to
handle both single-end and paired-end reads, neither of them exploit
the paired information in their algorithms.

Here we introduce PASSion, a pattern growth-based splice site
detection pipeline developed only for the analysis of paired-end
RNA-Seq reads. PASSion uses the mapped read in a pair as anchor
and then uses a high-resolution algorithm, pattern growth, to remap
the proximal and distal fragments of the unmapped read to a local
region of the reference indicated by the mate. It is capable of
identifying both known and novel canonical and non-canonical
junctions with SNP or sequencing error tolerance.

2 METHODS

PASSion computes the precise breakpoints of splice junctions in ﬁve stages:
initial mapping, building exon islands, high-resolution remapping, ﬁltering
and detection of canonical and non-canonical junctions, as shown in Figure 1.
In this section, we will ﬁrst explain the principle of pattern growth. After
that, PASSion’s different stages are explained. In addition, we will describe
how PASSion detects shared and sample speciﬁc junctions between multiple
samples.

2.1 Pattern growth

Pattern growth is an approach that can mine various frequent patterns
from large databases (Pei et al., 2004). Recently, this algorithm has been
implemented for the discovery of protein motif sequences (Ye et al., 2007)
and the detection of breakpoints of large deletions and medium-sized
insertions in the genome (Ye et al., 2009). Inspired by these applications,
we apply pattern growth to the analysis of RNA-Seq data.

Pattern growth can detect the minimum and maximum unique substrings
of a given pattern from a sequence. The inputs are a pattern and a reference
sequence; while the outputs consist of all unique substrings together with
their locations. In theory, the unique substrings can be searched from either
the leftmost or the rightmost base of the pattern. Here, we brieﬂy demonstrate
how to ﬁnd the unique substrings starting from the leftmost position of a
pattern. The procedure is also illustrated in Table 1.

Let a reference sequence R be ‘ATCAAGTATGCTTAGC’ and pattern P
be ‘ATGCTA’. The variable i is the growth index starting from 1. 9 is the
set of locations where SP,, the substring of pattern starting from position
1 to i, appears in R. First, SP1 is ‘A’, and the locations of ‘A’ in R, which
is (1, 4, 5, 8, 14), are stored in 9 . In the second loop, the algorithm will
search for SP2 ‘AT’ in the reference and update 9 to (2, 9). As the procedure
continues, the minimum unique substring SPm,n =SP, when SP, is the ﬁrst
unique substring. Later on, if SP, is unique and SP,+1 is not, then SP, is
the maximum substring SPmax. In our example, SPm,n = ‘ATG’ and SPmax =
‘ATGCT’. The pattern growth algorithm is implemented in high-resolution
remapping stage of the pipeline.

Fig. 1. The overview of the PASSion pipeline. Initially, a fast aligner is
applied to align the RNA-Seq reads to the reference genome. The exonic
reads are then piled up to build the exon islands. Pairs with one exonic read
and one unmapped read are then used to identify junctions. For each pair,
the location and direction of the exonic read determines the anchor point on
the reference genome and the direction in which the unmapped read will be
searched for. Knowing the anchor, search direction, exonic region and user-
deﬁned maximum insert size, the reads will be remapped to a deﬁned region
in the genome from two terminals (and the middle if necessary). A splice
junction is reported if the unique substrings from both ends can reconstruct
the original split read and has a sufﬁciently high number of supportive reads.
For splice sites with microhomology, canonical and non-canonical motifs
are used to ﬁnalize the breakpoints. For the junction without splicing motifs,
the leftmost breakpoint will be reported.

in preparation; http://www.sangerac.uk/resources/software/smalU). SMALT
is a recently developed, fast aligner employing a hashing concept similar to
SSAHA (Ning et al., 2001). With default settings, it reports the optimal
unique mapping for each read. The output format is set to samsoft (‘-f
samsoft’) with which the full sequence of read is also included in the SAM
(Li et al., 2009) format (so-called ‘soft clipping”). By applying SMALT,
reads which have a unique mapping position in the reference (perfect match
is not necessary) are referred to as mapped reads.

2.2.2 Building exon islands All the read alignments detected by SMALT
are piled up to the reference genome using SAMtools (Li et al., 2009). The
regions covered by at least one read are deﬁned as exon islands, which are
the potential search regions. Restricting read remapping to the exon islands
will dramatically decrease the search area and thus increase the speed of our
algorithm and lead to more unique hits. Some of the reads spanning exoni
exon boundaries will be discarded or reported as soft clipping, hence exon
boundary region may not be optimally covered. To account for this, exon
islands are extended with one insert size on both sides. For PASSion, we do
not use the option SMALT offers for the detection of junction boundaries due
to sensitivity issues in small exons and system performance reasons (option

restrict junction calls to the user-deﬁned regions.

2.2.3 High-resolution remapping Based on the initial mapping, the
paired-end sequences with one mapped and one unmapped reads are utilized
for remapping using pattern growth. We apply a local search strategy using
the mapped end as an anchor and ﬁnding all the unique substrings starting
from the leftmost and rightmost position of unmapped reads. Depending on
the direction of the anchor, the search area is either downstream or upstream
of the exon region of the anchor with the distance of the maximum intron
size which is a user-deﬁned parameter. Finally, a junction will be reported
when the combination of substrings from the leftmost and rightmost ends
makes up the original read. In case both reads in a pair are the mapped reads
but the mapping is imperfect, each of them will be used as an anchor and its
mate will be remapped accordingly. Due to the existence of small (5100 nt)
exons, some reads may span two splice junctions. These reads should be
mapped to the genome as three fragments. Therefore in this stage, we ﬁrst
detect junctions by remapping the reads as two fragments. Reads failing to
report junctions will be passed to the second round, in which they will be
divided into three fragments.

2.2.3.1 Round 1: aligning reads spanning a single junction isuppose
we have a pair of reads with one read mapped to the reference as anchor,
Randy”, and one unmapped read, Rm, with its potential alignment located
downstream of the anchor, as illustrated in Figure 2. Read length is r. First
we examine whether the close (relative to the anchor position) fragment of
the unmapped read uniquely exists in the reference or not. The search region
comprises exonic sequences within the maximum intron size downstream
from the anchor. If the minimum substring of the close end is sufﬁciently
long, the close end is then used as an anchor to search for the far end in
a similar manner. Finally, we join the substrings of both ends which are
Rm,,[1 : i] (close end) and Rm,,[r—p+ 1 : r] (far end) to construct a read RLM
using Equation (1):

R/um Zargkfiijumll :  +arngpSnRumlr—p‘l‘ 1 I r] 

where k, j,m and n represent the length of the minimum and maximum
substring of Rm starting from the proximal and distal end, respectively;
i is the length of a unique substring from the proximal end which is between
k and j; p is the length of a unique substring from the distal end which is

between m and n. A junction is reported when RLM =Rum.

2.2.3.2 Round 2: aligning reads spanning a small exon iwhen an
unmapped read spans a short exon (as showed as the red reads in Fig. 1), the
maximum substring of the close and far ends, Rm [1 :j] and Rm [r — n +1 :r],
cannot reconstruct the original read. In this circumstance, the middle string
will be extracted and remapped to the genome using pattern growth. The
constructed RLM is then the combination of maximum close end Rm,,[1:j],
middle argggqg Rm [j +1 :j + q] and the maximum far end Rm [r — n +1 :r],
as shown in Equation (2):

Fig. 2. Reconstruct unmapped reads using pattern growth. Using the
mapped read as anchor, pattern growth is applied to ﬁnd the minimum
and maximum substrings from the close end of unmapped read, denoted
as C_min and C_max, respectively in the ﬁgure. If succeed, the location
of the close end is used as anchor, the far end of unmapped read is
searched to ﬁnd F_min and F _max in a similar fashion. If the unique
substrings of proximal and distal ends make up the original read, a junction is
reported.

substring of the middle fragment in Rm; (1 is the length of a middle string
which is between e and f . Two junctions will be reported when RLM 2R“,
with one between the proximal end and middle, the other between the middle

and distal end.

2.2.4 Filtering splice junctions Since reads are very short fragments and
the entire genome contains repetitive regions, it is possible that each step
takes false positives into the next steps, eventually generating spurious splice
junctions. In our approach, we use a read depth-based strategy to ﬁlter out
spurious splice junctions.

For each junction, the average expression of the ﬂanking exons is
calculated using the read coverage of the donor and acceptor exons divided
by the frequency of their splice site, respectively. If the number of supportive
reads for a junction is <10% of the average coverage of the more deeply
covered ﬂanking exon, the junction is discarded. The user can adjust this
cutoff.

2.2.5 Detection of canonical and non-canonical events We report
junctions with length, breakpoint and breakpoint range due to the presence
of microhomology (Lee-Theilen et al., 2011). The canonical motif (GT-AG)
and two non-canonical motifs (AT-AC, GC-AG) are applied to ﬁnalize the
breakpoint within the microhomology range with priority order of GTiAG,
ATiAC and GCiAG in the forward strand and their reverse complement
motifs CTiAC, GTiAT and CTQC in the reverse strand. For those without
motifs, the leftmost breakpoints are used as the ﬁnal location. The strand of
the splicing motifs is used to decide the strand of the junctions.

2.3 Detection of differential and shared splicing
patterns

In the package, we provide an additional module to identify the shared and
sample speciﬁc splice junctions between multiple samples. First, it retrieves
all raw junctions (before ﬁltering) and exon coverage from each sample.
Then each junction is labeled by a tag indicating in which sample it occurs.
After this, junctions are merged and exon coverage are stacked. At the
end, the ﬁnal junctions are reported by applying the ﬁltering scheme to
the combined data. As we add a tag to each individual junction, we are
able to report per junction how many reads from each sample support it.
By merging the raw junctions and then setting the cutoff according to the
overall exon coverage, we are aiming at improving sensitivity for shared
junctions and to increase speciﬁcity for the sample-speciﬁc junctions.

2.4 Simulated data

We used human chromosome 17 as the reference and extracted 4837
transcripts >350 bp resulting in 14 654 known splice junctions from Ensembl
database. To test the read length effect, short, medium and long libraries were
constructed in silico with read lengths and insert sizes of (50 and 200 bp),
(75 and 300 bp) and (100 and 500 bp), respectively. Insert size is the length
of the two reads together with the non-sequenced part. As gene expression
levels in the cell display a broad dynamic range, reads are simulated at
different coverage. For each transcript, the reads are simulated at an average
coverage of 0.1><,1><, 5X,10><, 20X, 30><, 40><, 50X. 60X. 80X and
100>< resulting in the overall coding region coverage ranging from 0.2><
to 200x. The simulated data are generated using wgsim from SOAPSplice
package (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapsplice.html) with base error rate
and mutation rate of 0.02 and 0.001.

2.5 Real RNA-Seq data

Two RNA-Seq datasets (Accession SRRO65497 and SRR065533), which
were parts of the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, were
obtained from EMBL-EBI Sequence Read Archive. SRRO65497 is the RNA-
Seq data from HepG2 liver carcinoma cells, whereas SRRO65533 is from
human embryonic stem cells. Both sets are generated by Illumina Genome
Analyzer II paired-end sequencing with read lengths of 75 bp and insert
sizes of 200 bp, resulting in 17.2M and 17.7M pairs of reads, respectively.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Implementation

PASSion is an RNA-Seq analysis package. The pipeline is written
in shell scripts. The key component that utilizes pattern growth
to detect the precise splice junction site is implemented in C++
with parallelization. The other elements are implemented in Perl.
Currently, it runs on Linux system and requires gcci4.3, SMALT
and SAMtools to be pre-installed.

3.2 Performance on simulated data

PASSion and three other splice junction detection approaches,
TopHat (v1.3.1), MapSplice (v1.15.2) and HMMSplicer (v0.9.5),
were ﬁrst evaluated on the simulated datasets. The minimum and
maximum intron sizes were set to 20 bp and 409 600 bp for all
approaches. In this range, ~99% of splice junctions in human are
covered (Supplementary Fig. Slb). For the optional parameters, the
default values were used. The performance of the four methods on
the short, medium and long libraries is displayed in Figure 3. The
sensitivity (true positive rate) and speciﬁcity (1 — false positive rate)
are shown in subﬁgure (a, b, c) and (d, e, f). Since HMMSplicer
separates the predictions into canonical and non-canonical sets,
we use HMMSplicer1 to indicate the canonical predictions and
HMMSplicer2 to indicate the result of both canonical and non-
canonical junctions.

In general, the sensitivity curves of all the approaches display
similar trends, and the main difference is the increasing speed with
read coverage. Each of the four methods can detect almost all the
true junctions when coverage is >100 >< fold. In detail, TopHat is less
sensitive to the short read library compared with other approaches
(Fig. 3a). MapSplice detects the lowest number of junctions when
applied to libraries with long reads (Fig. 3c). In all the datasets, the
true positive rate of PASSion has the quickest growth rate along with
the read coverage and it is the most sensitive method overall. As for

HMMSplicer, the sensitivity curves did not differ very much among
three libraries but they are slightly lower than those of PASSion.

Upon ﬁirther inspection of Figure 3a—c, we noticed that at the
highest read coverage in each library, the average sensitivities
of all approaches reach 94.5, 94.6 and 91.1%, respectively. The
decrease in sensitivity for 100 bp library may be due to the
existence of small exons. In human, ~25% of exons are <100 bp
(Supplementary Fig. Sla). Therefore, special attention should be
paid to the multiple-junction spanning reads when read length is
around or >100 bp.

The prediction accuracy is clearly different for the four algorithms
as shown in Figure 3d—f. In general, the speciﬁcity of TopHat,
MapSplice and HMMSplicer drops with the read coverage, where
PASSions speciﬁcity remains high with speciﬁcities >97%. And
the high speciﬁcity of PASSion is not affected by either read
length or coverage. The speciﬁcity of HMMSplicer2 (canonical
and non-canonical junction sets) is much worse than HMMSplicer1
(canonical junction set). This indicates that the non-canonical
junction set contains a high number of false positive predictions.
The accuracy of TopHat is not affected by read length. As for
MapSplice and HMMSplicerl, their speciﬁcities decrease with the
increase of coverage; this phenomenon is more dramatical in the
50 bp library (Fig. 3d) than that in 100 bp library (Fig. 3f), indicating
that MapSplice and HMMSplicer are more suitable for long reads.

3.3 Prediction of splice junctions for real data

We apply PASSion, TopHat, HMMSplicer and MapSplice to predict
junctions for the real data using the same parameter settings as
in the simulated data. For convenience, data SRR065497 and
SRR065533 are represented by S1 and S2. The results are shown
in Table 2. In the predictions, the splice junctions annotated in
Ensembl database are labeled as Known. Since RNA-Seq has the
ability to detect the novel junctions, the unconﬁrmed junctions can
be novel. We use Unknown.2exons representing the junctions which
are not recorded in the database but of which both the donor and
acceptor sites are at the known exon boundaries retrieved from
Ensembl; UnknownJexon represents the unknown junctions with
either the donor or acceptor sites locates at a known exon boundary;
Unknown. Oexon are the those which link between two novel exon
boundaries. Conﬁrmed ratio is the fraction of the annotated splicing
to total number of predictions. Since we noticed that there are
too much false junctions in the non-canonical set predicted by
HMMSplicer, only the canonical set, HMMSplicerl, is used to
compare with the other results.

Real data are more complicated than the simulated data due to the
uneven read coverage induced by the broad dynamic range of gene
expression levels. As shown in Table 2, PASSion predicted 136 664
and 172568 splicing events for the two datasets, of which 84.1
and 80.3% are known junctions annotated in Ensembl database. In
general, PASSion displays a balanced performance with both a high
number of predictions and high conﬁrmed ratios. Compared with
PASSion, TopHat predicted a similarly high percentage of conﬁrmed
splice junctions but it predicted slightly less events. HMMSplicer
has a similar performance as TopHat, but only when the non-
canonical junctions are not included. As for MapSplice, although it
gave the highest number of predictions, the fractions of known exon
junctions in the prediction, which are 74.2 and 67.2%, are lower

refer to HMMSplicerl as the results where only canonical junctions are included, while HMMSplicer2 contains both canonical and non-canonical junctions.
The performance tested in short, median and long libraries are shown in (a and d), (b and e) and (c and f). For each library, a different read depth is
simulated, ranging from an average coverage (x-axis) of 0.2>< to 200x.

From this table, we can observe that PASSion displays a good performance with both a high number of predictions and high conﬁrmed ratios. Known represents the splice junctions
annotated in Ensembl database; Unknown.26xons, Unknown. lexon and Unknown.06xon represent the junctions which are not recorded in the database but of which the splice sites
are at 2, 1, 0 known exon boundaries, respectively. Conﬁrmed ratio is the fraction of the annotated junctions and the total number of detected junctions; HMMSplicerl refers to the
canonical junctions predicted by HMMSplicer.

than other algorithms, indicating that there are more false positive
splice junctions detected.

We ﬁirther created Venn diagrams showing the overlaps and
difference among the four methods for sample S1 (Fig. 4). In the
group of Known predictions, showed in Figure 4a, we found that the
majority of junctions, that is 97 887, are detected by all four methods;
2157, 744, 2583 and 1282 junctions are PASSion, HMMSplicer,
MapSplice and TopHat speciﬁc. We then categorized these known
junctions by splicing motifs. As can be seen in Table 3, while the

other methods cannot ﬁnd junctions with unknown motifs, PASSion
detects 78 junctions in this category (one example is shown in the
Supplementary Fig. S4).

Moreover, we found that the proportion of the commonly detected
junctions to the ones detected by just a single method in the
Known group is 82—88%. For junctions in the Unknown.2exons,
Unknown.1exon and Unknown.0exon groups, this overlap is
considerably lower at 38—45%, 28—39% and 7—29%, respectively,
demonstrating that the conﬁdence decreases with less database

information support. Again, MapSplice predicts 21 817 junctions in
the lowest conﬁdence group, in which 17402 are MapSplice speciﬁc,
indicative of a high number of false positives.

The CPU running time and memory usage of four methods are
listed in the Supplementary Table S1. When we run PASSion,
TopHat, MapSplice and HMMSplicer on two sets of real data, all
the jobs are submitted to the farm cluster of Welcome Trust Sanger
Institute. As can be seen in the Table, Mapsplice is the fastest; TopHat
uses the least memory, PASSion consumes the most memory and
HMMSplicer is the slowest.

3.4 Detection of shared and sample-speciﬁc junctions

To assess PASSion’s ability to report junctions from different
samples, we applied the multi-sample module to predict the shared

and sample speciﬁc exon—exon junctions for the real RNA-Seq data
S1 and S2. As shown in Figure 5a, we detected 109130 exon—
exon junctions supported by the reads from both samples. Each
junction has 22 reads for support in median; 28 927 splice events
only appeared in S1 and 63 889 junctions exclusively occur in S2. As
for the sample-speciﬁc junctions, the median number of supportive
reads is 1 and 2 for S1 and S2, respectively. This gives an indication
that many genes are lowly expressed. The coverage of the junctions
unique to one of the two cell lines and those shared are plotted in
Supplementary Figure S2.

Different categories are recorded with different colors in the
ﬁnal BED ﬁle. Figure 5b illustrated the junctions located at
chr17:48 600 000—48 770 000 visualized by the UCSC genome
browser. As can be seen, almost all the splice junctions existing
in gene ABCC3 are from sample S1 (depicted in red) indicating that

geneABCC3 is only expressed in HepG2 liver carcinoma cells; while
at upper stream of gene ABCC3, all the exon—exon junctions of gene
CACNAIG are sample S2 speciﬁc showing this gene is exclusively
expressed in the human embryonic stem cells. We also found that
gene SPATA20 is expressed in both samples since the majority of
the splicing events occurred both in S1 and S2 (showed in black).
However, there also exist three Sl speciﬁc (red) and two S2 speciﬁc
(green) junctions, indicating that each sample may have different
transcript isoforms of gene SPATA20.

4 DISCUSSION

We have presented PASSion, a package that is capable of capturing
both annotated and novel splice junctions with high accuracy.
Instead of using the popular data structures applied in next-
generation sequencing analysis, e.g. sufﬁxarray and hash table, the
key component of PASSion is based on pattern growth which has
not been applied in RNA-Seq analysis before. In addition, PASSion
currently can facilitate the discovery of differential and shared
splicing patterns from multiple samples.

One unique advantage distinguishing PASSion from TopHat,
MapSplice and HMMSplicer is that PASSion can detect the splice
junctions with unknown motifs, which are missed by the other tools.
In PASSion, splicing motifs are not used in the main stages of
junction detection, which are building exon islands, high-resolution
remapping and ﬁltering. Only in the last step of the pipeline,
canonical and non-canonical motifs are applied to ﬁnalize the
breakpoint within the microhomology range. For those without
motifs, they also will be reported with the leftmost breakpoint as
the ﬁnal location.

Another advantage is that PASSion is very accurate for highly
abundant transcripts. It is shown that in sample S1, a small fragment
of genes, ~3%, are highly expressed with read coverage >100><
(Supplementary Fig. S3). In the case of pooling RNA-Seq datasets,
more transcripts will be highly covered. Currently, many algorithms
can accurately analyze low abundance transcripts, but are less
efﬁcient for detecting junctions in highly expressed genes. However,
PASSion has a high true positive rate for both low and high
abundance transcripts. First, the application of a local search strategy
helped to rule out potential false locations. Secondly, we used pattern
growth, a high-resolution algorithm which can be accurate to a single
nucleotide level. Together with the aid of splice site motifs, PASSion
is able to predict precise breakpoints of exon—exon junctions without
any nucleotide shift. The third and most important factor is the
read depth-dependent cutoff ﬁltering. By default, PASSion reports
junctions where the depth of supportive reads is >10% of the average
coverage of the more highly expressed ﬂanking exon. It seems quite
simple but effective. This ﬁltering scheme is similar to the minimum
minor isoform frequency parameter in TopHat, in which junctions
are reported if the abundance of the supportive reads is at least
15% of the depth of more deeply covered exons. MapSplice and
HMMSplicer use very complicated scores to remove the spurious
junctions but are less effective for highly abundant transcripts.

As for the memory usage, PASSion consumes ~9 GB memory
for 17.2M pairs of 75 bp long reads with the default settings.
The memory usage can be improved by setting a smaller bin size
parameter, since reads are processed per bin. Theoretically, reducing
the bin size will increase the frequency of ﬁle reading and writing,
but it will not signiﬁcantly increase the CPU processing time.

Currently, PASSion is the third fastest method according to the
CPU processing time. The wall time can be decreased by setting
up to eight parallel threads at initial mapping and high-resolution
remapping, which are the most time-consuming steps. Moreover,
with computer resources becoming cheaper and cheaper and more
computer clouds and clusters becoming available, memory and CPU
running time will not be the bottleneck for computing. Accuracy
should be the more important concern in data analysis.

Nevertheless, we still missed some rare splicings mediating cross
chromosome gene fusion, because we assume that both reads in a
pair are mapped to the same chromosome. It will be one of the
tasks to tackle in the near future. Besides, we are also interested
in detecting allele-speciﬁc expression and RNA editing events.
Quantiﬁcation of these post-transcriptional modiﬁcations will
contribute to study imprinting, regulation of differential expression
and differential stability of genes or transcripts. Eventually such
detailed analysis will increase our understanding of cell and disease
phenotypes.

Currently, more and more labs prefer to sequence RNA using
the paired-end protocol due to the obvious advantages provided
by paired-end reads over single-end reads. PASSion’s ability to
take advantage of paired-end reads together with its overall high
performance will make PASSion a valuable tool for RNA-Seq data
analysis in the future.

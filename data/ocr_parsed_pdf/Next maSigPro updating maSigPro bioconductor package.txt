2 METHODS
2.1 Model

Considering the case of a time-course experiment with Ttime points and
S experimental groups or series (e.g. different treatments, strains, tissues),
maSigPro uses polynomial regression to model the gene expression value
y,- at condition 1' and time t,-, and deﬁnes S 7 1 binary variables (ZS) to
distinguish between each experimental group and a reference group
(Conesa et al., 2006). For the sake of simplicity and illustration of the
model, we consider here a quadratic regression and an experiment with
two series. The polynomial model of y,- is

yi=50 + 51011321? + 5321i+54li21i+ ﬁslgzli‘l‘ai

maSigPro originally supported only LMs, where the response variable is
modeled as a normal distribution. GLMs are a generalization of classical
LMs, which can accommodate a wider class of distributions named as
exponential family, providing great ﬂexibility for modeling different types
of response variables. Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Gamma and NB are
examples of this family of distributions. These family classes have generic
deﬁnitions, which imply that a common maximum likelihood method for
estimating the parameters of the model can be applied to all of them.
Although explicit mathematical expressions can be found for estimators,
iterative numerical methods based on the NewtoniRaphson are typically
used (Dobson, 2002; McCullagh and Nelder, 1989). In GLMs, hypothesis
testing and the goodness of fit of the model are based on the log-
likelihood ratio statistic, also denoted as deviance D:

D = 2mm» — 10%th

where [(ﬁmm.) is the maximized likelihood of a model with m, the max-
imum number of parameters that can be estimated, and [(3) denotes the
likelihood of the P-dimensional parameter )3. The difference between the
deviance statistics of the model of interest, M1, and a model without
covariates, M0, is A=D0 — D1~x;, which can be used to evaluate the
signiﬁcance of each gene ﬁt. Within the GLMs deﬁnition, LMs are re-
covered when the normal distribution is followed.

To accommodate the GLMs, the existing p.vector() and Tﬁt() func-
tions of the maSigPro package that account, respectively, for ﬁrst and
second regression steps of the method have been modiﬁed by replacing
the function lm() by glm(). A new argument, denoted counts, has been
added to select the type of modeling. The default setting is
counts = FALSE to keep the LMs and by setting counts = TRUE,
maSigPro will apply the GLMs option with NB distribution. NB is the
recommended family to use when dealing with RNA-seq as it allows
overdispersion of variance, which is related to the mean through the (6)
parameter:

it?

Y,»~NB(p,i, 6), where E( Y,»)= u,» and Var( Y,») = u,» + 6

Theta (6) can be estimated using available software (for instance
edgeR, Robinson et al., 2010). When no estimation of 6 is possible, we
recommend to use the default value, 6 = 10. Our experience indicates that
maSigPro results do not change much by using different values of 6. The
package also includes the possibility of applying any other available ex-
ponential family through the additional argument family.

In the second step of maSigPro, the goodness of ﬁt, R2, of each opti-
mized gene model is computed. This parameter is used for selecting genes
with clear expression trends. In LMs, R2 is deﬁned from the residual sum
of squares, and in GLMs the goodness of ﬁt is evaluated in terms of the
deviance: the percentage of deviance explained by the model. However,
for the sake of consistency with older maSigPro versions, the package
maintains the notation R2 for both LMs and GLMs. The remaining
functions of the package stay unchanged.

Note that no explicit normalization procedure is implemented within
the maSigPro methodology, and hence, data should be appropriately

normalized beforehand. Results presented in this article have been com-
puted by using TMM normalization (Robinson and Oshlack, 2010).

2.2 The evaluation strategy

To evaluate the performance of the updated maSigPro to identify differ-
entially expressed genes (DEGs) in RNA-seq time-course data, we have
created different synthetic datasets in which we consider several possible
experimental designs. Each dataset has been analyzed with maSigPro-
LM, maSigPro-GLM and edgeR. Comparison with maSigPro-LM was
included to highlight the limitations of this modeling with count data
when the number of replicates is low, even after normalization.

Both maSigPro and edgeR methods are based on the GLMs but with a
different approach. The major difference between the maSigPro and
edgeR methods is that maSigPro is specialized in the estimation of
serial data, i.e. when the independent variable is quantitative such as
time. This is achieved by providing an easy way to deﬁne a polynomial
model for the data. Another important difference is that maSigPro fol-
lows a second stepwise regression that obtains the best model for each
gene and retains only significant coefﬁcients in each model, whereas
edgeR applies the same model to each gene.

2.2.1 Simulated data Simulations have been created using NB distri-
butions with a parametrization based on the mean u and size 6. In each
sample 1', where the targeted total number of reads is N, and the relative
abundance of each gene g is pgi, the expected gene counts, ugi, can be
computed as

My»: N X Pgi

Note that, as gene counts are randomly drawn from a NB distribution,
the simulated count values of each gene will slightly vary among samples
and so will the total number of reads N,- of the sample 1'.

Simulated datasets were designed to contain genes that belong to one
of the K = 4 gene expression level classes, which are deﬁned by a ﬁxed
reference value at time 1 (ka) and a given size (nk, number of genes) in
each k level as indicated in Table 1.

To model time-associated gene expression changes we considered the
following linear expression:

bg =0, ifg is not DEG
Vgi=Vk1+bng1li, i=2,...,T
bg 7A0 ifgis DEG

where 5% genes have bg values different from zero and are differentially
expressed. Furthermore, we modeled three different data scenarios by
assigning different values to the bg parameter to subsets of genes: (A)
In this scenario, all DEGs increase their expression linearly with bg = 0.2;
(B) In this scenario, half of the DEGs increase bg = 0.2 and half decrease
with bg = — 0.2, and we added, when needed, a positive value to vgl to
avoid negative means; (C) Genes follow a strong upregulation in the
second time-point followed by decrease with bg = — 0.2.

Datasets were modeled either with one or two time series. In the two
series case, one series was modeled as described and the second was
modeled as a ﬂat profile. For each scenario and series number, datasets

were simulated with 1, 2, 3 or 5 replicates. Finally, genes were considered
to have constant length equal to 1 kb in all datasets and no length cor-
rection was applied in the data.

Following this simulation scheme, the relative proportion of counts of
gene g in sample i is

pgi : Vgi/Z(Vgi)

This approach provides the way to take into account not only the
expression level, but also the composition of the RNA population in
the sample, as gene proportions are computed a posteriori and are af-
fected by the gene expression changes modeled in each scenario.

2.2.2 Experimental data The maSigPro-GLM and compared meth-
ods were evaluated on a real dataset that describes the transcriptional
response of inmunocompromised Arabidopsis tlialiana lines to the barley
powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis (th) (Hacquard et al., 2013;
Maekawa et al., 2012). In this study, pen2 pad4 sag101 Arabidopsis
plants harboring (pps) or without (B12) the MLAl-HA construct were
challenged with either the th isolate K1 expressing the cognate AVRAl
effector for MLAl or the th isolate A6 expressing other AVRA ef-
fectors. Three independent biological replicates per condition were har-
vested at 6, 12, 18, 24h post-inoculation. The experimental design of this
study has therefore 4 time points, 2 covariates with 2 levels each one:
MLAl (pps or B12) and th isolate (A6 or K1), 3 replicates and 6477
genes. Initial analysis of these data revealed little effect of the MLAl
construct covariate, which was then eliminated from the model for sim-
plicity. Therefore, in the maSigPro formulation, this experiment corres-
ponds to a replicated 4 time points course with two series (th isolate
A6 or K1). Data are available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
query/acc.cgi?acc = GSE43163.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulation studies

The simulation experiment contained 24 datasets obtained by
combining three secenarios (A, B and C), one or two time series
and one of the four replication levels. Datasets were created with
6 = 10, and 6 time points. Here, we show results from data with
20000 genes. Simulations with a smaller dataset of 6000 genes
gave similar results.

One of the challenges in the development of the maSigPro—
GLM methodology was to establish an appropriate cutoff value
for the R2 parameter in the second regression step. We analyzed
False Discovery Rate [FDR : false positives (FP)/Selection] and
False Non—discovery Rate [FNR: false negatives (FN)/Non—
selected] for varying R2 values at fixed FDR = 0.05 (Fig. 1).
We observed that as the number of replicates increase, FDR
and FNR drop and that the two series scenario is slightly
better than the one series case. In general, for R2 = 0.7 the
method achieves a good control of FDR with negligible FNR.
However, in designs with three replicates and two series, and
when ﬁve replicates are available, FDR is also controlled by
R2 = 0.5. Taking this result into account, we applied a
R2 = 0.7 cutoff value to obtain performance metrics in our simu—
lation study. Table 2 shows the number of selected genes, FF and
FN for the three methods at a FDR = 0.05. Several conclusions
can be drawn from these results:

(1) Absence of replication is clearly insufﬁcient for appropri—
ate time—course modeling. maSigPro—LM is unable to ﬁnd

DEGs and maSigPro—GLM calls too many FP. edgeR is
not recommended for unreplicated data and, therefore, not
used in this case.

(2) In general, maSigPro—LM performs poorly on RNA—seq
data in all scenarios and conditions.

(3) Given two or more replicates, maSigPro—GLM succeeds in
controlling FDR <5%, whereas edgeR tends to give
moreFP, ranging between 11 and 20% false calls.

(4) FNR is properly controlled both by maSigPro—GLM and
edgeR. This last method has a zero false call rate in our
simulations, whereas maSigPro—GLM shows FNR <1%.
Results were basically similar considering one or two series
and different expression patterns for DEGs.

3.2 Experimental study

We applied both edgeR and maSigPro—GLM to the A.thaliana
time—course data considering the two series deﬁned by the th
isolate. An R2 threshold of 0.5 was chosen for the second
maSigPro—GLM step, according to the results presented in
Figure 1. Genes with <100 reads in all samples were discarded,
resulting in a dataset containing 5838 genes. edgeR identiﬁed
2870 DEGs across the different time points, whereas
maSigPro—GLM selected 2158 DEGs (FDR = 0.05). There
were 1629 genes in common between the two methods, 529 spe—
ciﬁcally found by maSigPro and 1241 identiﬁed only by edgeR.
Out of these 1241 edgeR exclusive DEGs, 1194 were identiﬁed as
significant in the ﬁrst maSigPro but ﬁnally not selected in the
second regression step because their R2< 0.5, while the remaining
47 genes were not preselected by maSigPro in the ﬁrst step. To
better understand the gene expression patterns associated to
similarities and differences between the two methods, we ran—
domly selected three genes belonging to each of these sets
(Fig. 2). These examples suggested that genes selected by both
methodologies and exclusively by maSigPro (A and B) have
good regression models, clean expression trends and strong ex—
pression changes. Genes selected by edgeR and not preselected
by maSigPro (C) show little fold change and high variance, and
genes that edgeR calls signiﬁcant but do not pass the second
regression step in maSigPro (D) used to display time—point—spe—
ciﬁc variances and expression differences.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work, we describe and justify the modiﬁcations intro—
duced in the maSigPro package to deal with RNA—seq data.
We have incorporated GLMs into the ﬁrst and second regression
steps of the algorithm and add the parameter counts into the
p.vector() function to select the type of statistical modeling.
Setting counts = TRUE chooses the GLMs and applies the NB
distribution, whereas counts = FALSE selects the Linear Model
as previously. The remaining functions for deﬁning the polyno—
mial model, selecting genes, clustering and visualization
remained unchanged, making maSigPro a uniﬁed package for
the analysis of both microarray and RNA—seq time—course data.

maSigPro applies GLMs to model RNA—seq as do other dedi—
cated statistical packages such as edgeR, included for

comparison in this study. The major difference between
maSigPro and edegR methods is that maSigPro is specialized
in parameter estimation of serial data, i.e. when the independent
variable is quantitative such as time. This is achieved by provid—
ing an easy way to deﬁne a polynomial model for the data that
have the flexibility to ﬁt different time—course patterns. In con—
trast, ed geR treats time not as a continuous variable but as multi—
factor. Another important difference is that maSigPro follows a
second step that obtains the best model for each gene such that
only signiﬁcant coefﬁcients are retained in each model, whereas
edgeR applies the same model to each gene under the multifactor
consideration. This results in models with more variables that
might be prone to give false calls. Moreover, we apply in the
second step a ﬁlter on gene selection that takes into account the
R2 of the regression model, implying that only genes with a good
ﬁt to the model will be selected. The consequences of the differ—
ent implementations are clear in the results of the simulation
study and the experimental data. Basically, we observed a
better control of FDRs in maSigPro and that genes selected by
maSigPro have not only signiﬁcant models but also well—ﬁtted
models. Finally, the maSigPro package also provides clustering
and visualization of significant genes.

One important aspect that we considered in our simulation
study was the number of replicates and the complexity of the

time—course experiment (one or two comparing series). Our re—
sults indicate that one replicate is clearly not sufﬁcient for the
proper control of the FDRs. While initial RNA—seq took advan—
tage of the accuracy of the technology to avoid replication,
recent studies highlight the importance of appropriate replication
for a sound RNA—seq data analysis (Liu et al., 2014; Sims et al.,
2014; Tarazona et al., 2011). Within the parameter settings of the
simulation experiment, we show that maSigPro—GLMs controls
FDR and FN from two replicates and that the performance
improves as the number of replicates and series increase.
Related to this, it is also interesting to comment results of the
maSigPro—LM analysis on the synthetic data. While it might be
obvious that LMs are not appropriate to model count data, one
could speculate that after data normalization, discretization
would be removed and the normalized data could be treated as
continuous data. However, transformed data are not normally
distributed, and right asymmetry still holds. Although trans—
formed data do not necessarily conserve the probability distribu—
tion of the untransformed data, the GLMs ﬁtting process mainly
depends on the assumed variance—to—mean relationship. Linear
transformations of the data do not change these relations and
link functions such as the logarithm are not exclusive for discrete
data. This becomes evident when looking into the maSigPro—LM
results on the simulated data: the linear model performs poorly
in most scenarios. However, the central limit theorem suggests
that models developed for normal data can be applied to non—
normal data if the available sample is large enough. We show
that maSigPro—LM can achieve good FDR control when five
replicates per condition are used in the two series scenario, al—
though still suffering from a significant rate of false—negative
calls. The versatility of the maSigPro package to choose the
LMs or GLMs with one simple argument option allows easy
adaptation of the methodology to the types of data and experi—
mental design.

Finally, although signiﬁcance thresholds in maSigPro—GLM
maintain their statistical meaning, the goodness of fit, which is
used in the second step of maSigPro to select genes with well—
ﬁtted models, is evaluated in GLMs in terms of the deviance: the
percentage of deviance explained by the model. We conducted
experiments with simulated data to understand how this param—
eter behaves in different experimental settings. Our results indi—
cated that similar to the recommended threshold in the LM
version of maSigPro, a cutoff value of 0.7 is valid in most scen—
arios. However, when data are abundant, i.e. triplicated meas—
urements and multiple series, this threshold could be lowered to
0.5. Indeed, this value was used in the analysis of the real
Arabidopsis dataset. The comparison with edgeR, which solely
selects genes on the basis of a signiﬁcant P—value, showed that
the maSigPro filtering based on a R2 cutoff value resulted in
genes with consistent models. Genes that were signiﬁcant with
both methods but discarded by maSigPro because of a R2<0.5
used to have outliers or highly variable measurements (Fig. 2).

In conclusion, we show that maSigPro—GLM is suitable for the
identiﬁcation of DEGs from time—course RNA—seq data under a

wide range of experimental settings. The updated package suc—
cessfully controls both false—positive and false—negative detection
rates.

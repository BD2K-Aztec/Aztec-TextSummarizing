ABSTRACT

Motivation: Kotai Antibody Builder is a Web service for tertiary struc-
tural modeling of antibody variable regions. It consists of three main
steps: hybrid template selection by sequence alignment and canonical
rules, 3D rendering of alignments and CDR-H3 loop modeling. For the
last step, in addition to rule-based heuristics used to build the initial
model, a refinement option is available that uses fragment assembly
followed by knowledge-based scoring. Using targets from the Second
Antibody Modeling Assessment, we demonstrate that Kotai Antibody
Builder generates models with an overall accuracy equal to that of the
best-performing semi-automated predictors using expert knowledge.
Availability and implementation: Kotai Antibody Builder is available

1 INTRODUCTION

Antibody variable regions constitute a unique protein module
that has evolved to recognize Virtually any biomolecular struc-
ture with high speciﬁcity and afﬁnity. These properties have
enabled the design of antibodies for use in the diagnosis and
treatment of cancers and autoimmune and infectious diseases
(Kuroda et al., 2012). In addition to their clinical value, antibo-
dies are extremely important for routine assays used in basic
research. Computational modeling of antibody structure is a cru-
cial step in engineering new antibody molecules, but there are few
tools available to the general public, and accurately modeling
loops in complementary determining regions (CDRs) remains
an open problem. The PIGS server (Marcatili et al., 2008) was
validated in the ﬁrst blind Antibody Modeling Assessment
(Almagro et al., 2011). However, prediction of the third heavy
chain CDR (CDR-H3) remains difﬁcult because of its structural
diversity.

Recently, the Second Antibody Modeling Assessment (AMA-
II) was held. AMA-II was divided into two stages: in stage 1,
sequences were provided, and teams were assessed on the overall
accuracy of their models. In stage 2, the crystal structures of the
variable region lacking only CDR-H3 were provided, and groups

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

were assessed on the accuracy of CDR-H3 loop prediction.
In stage 1, the joint Osaka University Astellas (JOA) team
achieved the lowest average root-mean square deviation
(RMSD) for CDR-H3 (2.3 A) and generated the most accurate
models for 4 of 11 targets. In stage 2, the JOA team generated the
most accurate models (with RMSDs of 1A or less) for 4 of 10
targets (Almagro et al., 2014). However, the method used by the
J OA team required much manual intervention and expert know-
ledge. Kotai Antibody Builder represents a fully automated but
simplified implementation of the pipeline used by the JOA team
(Shirai et al., 2014).

2 METHODS

Kotai Antibody Builder is composed of two main modules: MANGO
and Spanner (Lis et al., 2011). The MANGO module selects template
structures for the framework (i.e. non-CDR) and each CDR by a se-
quence-based database search and rule-based heuristics, while Spanner
builds loops by fragment assembly. Because CDR-H3 loops are well
known to be more difﬁcult to model than those of other CDRs, Kotai
Antibody Builder provides a reﬁnement option that includes sampling by
fragment assembly followed by side-chain modeling and scoring by an
empirical scoring function.

2.1 Framework selection

The local structure of residues 7710 in the heavy (H) chain (here denoted
‘framework motif) is diverse and can be classified into ﬁve types. In the
ﬁrst step of Kotai Antibody Builder, the framework motif is predicted by
a statistics-based classiﬁcation. Next, sequence alignment is used to ﬁnd
framework templates for H and light (L) chains separately. Only tem-
plates that have the same framework motif with that predicted for the
query are used. Here, the CDR regions are masked so that only the
framework region is aligned and scored. The H and L results are
merged and sorted by sequence identity (squD). The Molprobity soft-
ware (Chen et al., 2010) is used to assess if the percentage of backbone
Ramachandran conformations inside the favored region is above a
threshold (>85%). If there is no such model found, the selection criteria
are relaxed and template models are selected by squD, regardless of the
predicted framework motif.

2.2 Non-H3 CDR selection

It is well known that each non-H3 CDR can be classiﬁed into one of
several canonical clusters. We use the most recent deﬁnition of CDR
clusters (North et al., 2011), along with position-speciﬁc scoring matrix

(PSSM)-based scoring, to predict the best non-H3 CDR cluster for the
query (Shirai et al., 2014). For a given CDR, if the framework template
and query are predicted to belong to the same cluster, the loop in the
framework template is used; otherwise, the template with the highest
squD in the predicted cluster is used.

2.3 CDR-H3 selection

Because CDR-H3 is diverse in terms of length, sequence and structure,
canonical rules have not been identified. Earlier, we developed H3
rules that partly classify CDR-H3 structures based on amino acid
sequence (Kuroda et al., 2008; Shirai et al., 1996). Kotai Antibody
Builder uses the most important of these rules (rule i), which predicts
the structural class of the ‘base’ proximal to CDR-H3. For construction
of the initial model, we use rule i if the length of loop is longer than five
residues. In the optional reﬁnement step, Spanner is used to generate 20
loop models followed by successive energy minimizations by the cosgene
module in the myPresto package (Fukunishi et al., 2003) and OSCAR-
leap (Liang et al., 2014). Here, we used a customized Spanner fragment
database including only antibody structures for fast and speciﬁc CDR
loop modeling. Finally, the single loop model was selected based on the
OSCAR-leap score.

2.4 Model building

Selected loop models are grafted onto the framework template. If there
are insertions/ deletions in the template, Spanner is used to ﬁx them. Side-
chain modeling by OSCAR-star (Liang et al., 2011) followed by short
energy minimization with positional restraints on backbone atoms is also
carried out (Fukunishi et al., 2003). The initial calculation takes $10
min, whereas reﬁnement requires an additional ~90 min.

2.5 Web server

Kotai Antibody Builder accepts amino acid sequences for H and L Fv
regions. The resulting 3D model can be downloaded in PDB format and
visualized by the JSmol viewer. The PDB IDs of templates as well as the
canonical classiﬁcations of each loop are shown.

3 RESULTS

To assess the accuracy of Kotai Antibody Builder, we used
targets 2711 from AMA-II. In Figure l, we show the resulting
Cot RMSDs of rank-l models submitted by the JOA team along-
side rank-l initial and reﬁned models from the Web server. The

overall RMSD was ~l  The refinement option was much more
successful in modeling CDR-H3 loops than the protocol used to
generate initial models or by the PIGS server (Marcatili et al.,
2008). Surprisingly, the CDR-H3 accuracy for the reﬁned loops
(2.3 A) was equal to that of the stage-l JOA submitted models,
the generation of which required careful manual inspection.
There was a slight increase (~0.l A) in the RMSD of the non-
H3 CDR loops when the refinement option was used because of
the fact that the other loops were not held rigid during the mini-
mizations; however, we found that this slight ﬂexibility in the
non-H3 CDRs was necessary for proper modeling of the H3
loops.

4 CONCLUSIONS

There are few fully automated antibody modeling pipelines avail-
able to the general public, and none that we are aware of that can
reach this level of accuracy for CDR-H3 loops. Thus, Kotai
Antibody Builder is expected to contribute uniquely to the
field of antibody structural modeling and design.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: A wealth of protein—protein interaction (PPI) data has
recently become available. These data are organized as PPI networks
and an efficient and biologically meaningful method to compare
such PPI networks is needed. As a first step, we would like to
compare observed networks to established network models, under
the aspect of small subgraph counts, as these are conjectured to
relate to functional modules in the PPI network. We employ the
software tool GraphCrunch with the Graphlet Degree Distribution
Agreement (GDDA) score to examine the use of such counts for
network comparison.

Results: Our results show that the GDDA score has a pronounced
dependency on the number of edges and vertices of the networks
being considered. This should be taken into account when testing
the fit of models. We provide a method for assessing the statistical
significance of the fit between random graph models and biological
networks based on non-parametric tests. Using this method we
examine the fit of Erd s—R nyi (ER), ER with fixed degree distribution
and geometric (3D) models to PPI networks. Under these rigorous
tests none of these models fit to the PPI networks. The GDDA
score is not stable in the region of graph density relevant to current
PPI networks. We hypothesize that this score instability is due to
the networks under consideration having a graph density in the
threshold region for the appearance of small subgraphs. This is
true for both geometric (3D) and ER random graph models. Such
threshold behaviour may be linked to the robustness and efficiency
properties of the PPI networks.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in experimental science and in literature mining
techniques have generated a considerable amount of protein—protein
interaction (PPI) data from several organisms. These interactions
are often integrated to form networks, which can help put the
proteins into their functional and physiological context. A reliable
and efﬁcient method for large network comparison would be very
useful (Sharan and Ideker, 2006). Such a comparison may yield
mechanistic and evolutionary insights, help to identify missing
links and even aid network validation for those organisms where
experimental data are scarce. A ﬁrst step is to establish a method for
network comparison with well-studied random network models.
Current PPI networks are unfortunately still very incomplete and
rife with noise (von Mering et (11., 2002). They tend to have a

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

large number of false positives and false negatives. These obscure
meaningful conclusions and offer challenges to robust methods
of analysis (Alm and Arkin, 2003). Network comparison is also
a computationally difﬁcult task because typical PPI networks are
relatively large, e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae already has about
18 4-40 binary PPIs in the DIPTM database.

Depending on the aspect under which networks are to be
compared, short lists of summary statistics are often used. Classical
summary statistics used include the degree distribution, the mean
path length and the clustering coefﬁcient (see Costa et (11., 2007
for an overview and many more summary statistics). Here, we
compare networks based on small subgraphs, since cell biology
is thought of as modular; many pathways and feedback loops are
inherently seen as detachable modules (Hartwell et (11., 1999). While
it has been shown that network motifs alone do not determine
function in general (Ingram et (11., 2006), there is the possibility of
a close connection between subgraphs and biological ﬁinctionality
(Shen-Orr et (11., 2002).

Our aim is to compare biological networks and random graph
models under the aspect of similar subgraph counts. Such subgraph
counts were introduced by Milo et (11. (2002) with the aim of
detecting over-represented small subgraphs. They compared counts
for connected 3—4 node subgraphs in real-world networks to those of
certain random networks, and called those patterns network motifs;
see also Ciriello and Guerra (2008) for a review.

Counting small connected subgraphs in large PPI networks is
computationally demanding. Moreover, the number of possible
subgraphs of n-nodes increases exponentially with n, e.g. for n=3
we have two differently connected subgraphs, and 21 for n=5.
Przulj et (11. (2004) disregarded the frequency subjacent to the
deﬁnition of motifs and counted connected induced subgraphs with
3—5 nodes, which they call graphlets (Fig. 1). A subgraph S of G is
said to be induced if it contains all the edges that appear in G over
the same subset of nodes. For example, the only induced subgraphs
of a triangle are edges. Methods have also been developed to count
6- and 7-node graphlets (Hormozdiari et (11., 2007, Grochow and
Kellis, 2007). Alon et (11. (2008) used a combinatorial colour-coding
technique to count up to 10-node non-induced subgraphs, arguing
that these are more relevant to compare the incomplete and noisy
networks currently available.

To combine the distributions that result from these graphlet
counts, the so-called relative graphlet frequency (RGF) distance
(Przulj et (11., 2004) and the Graphlet Degree Distribution
Agreement (GDDA) have been suggested (Przulj, 2007). The
RGF distance identiﬁes all subgraphs with 3—5 nodes in two
networks and compares the frequency of their appearance, while
the GDDA statistic deﬁnes node-speciﬁc permutation groups, called
automorphism orbits, within each of the 29 (2—5 nodes) possible

graphlets of the two networks being compared. Their scaled and
normalized orbit degree distributions are then reduced by averaging
the Euclidean distances between matching orbits of each network
over all orbits (see Section 2 for a detailed description).

In this article, we use the software tool GraphCrunch (Milenkovic
et (11., 2008) to examine the use of graphlet counts for network
comparison. Focusing our analysis on the more reﬁned GDDA,
we ﬁnd the statistic to have a non-monotone dependency on the
number of edges and nodes of the networks being considered. As
suggested in Przulj (2007), we use the GDDA score to compare
PPI networks with three random graph models: Erdos—Renyi (ER)
random graphs, ER random graphs with ﬁxed degree distribution and
geometric three-dimensional (GEO3D) random graphs. Observing
that the empirical distribution of the GDDA score under these
theoretical models is far from normal, we provide non-parametric
test procedures to assess the model ﬁt. We ﬁnd that none of the
random network models considered ﬁt the PPI networks. While we
conclude that we are still far from having a satisfactory null model
for PPI networks, we provide a statistical framework for assessing
the ﬁt of potential new models under the aspect of similarity of
small subgraph counts. The proposed method relies only on the
assumption that if a PPI network is generated by a given model,
then the empirical distributions of the GDDA comparisons between
the PPI network versus model, and between model versus model,
will be similar. Hence, any ﬁiture model proposed for PPI networks
can also be tested using this method.

Strikingly, the GDDA score is not stable in the graph density
region of the biological networks considered. We hypothesize that
this instability arises because the observed graph densities fall in
the threshold regions for the appearance of small subgraphs, under
both ER and GEO3D random graph models. In this region there is
high volatility in subgraph counts even for two networks which are
generated under the same model and with the same speciﬁcations.
While neither of these models ﬁt the data, we can still use their
threshold regions as proxy and conjecture that the PPI networks
under consideration operate near the threshold for the appearance
of small subgraphs. Such behaviour would imply relatively short
paths between proteins in networks, with presumably just enough
alternative paths to ensure robustness, while maintaining a low edge
density. This behaviour may also have further implications in the
optimal design of networks.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 PPI networks considered

PPI networks are modelled by an undirected graph whose nodes represent
the individual proteins; an edge is drawn between every two proteins which
are known to interact. Multiple edges and self-loops are excluded. Six PPI
networks were analysed: three of yeast. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and three
of human. Homo sapiens (Table 1).

BioGRID interaction data for human (release 2.0.55. www.thebiogrid.org)
was ﬁltered using the key words ‘Afﬁnity Capture-MS” and ‘Two-hybrid’ and
divided into two distinct datasets: BG_MS and BG_Y2H. respectively.

2.2 Basic graph theory deﬁnitions

An undirected graph G with no loops or multiple edges is a pair (V(G), E(G))
where the elements of V(G) represent the set of vertices; the elements of
E(G) are called edges. and they are two-element subsets {v,w} of V(G).
When {v,w} EE(G) we say v and w are adjacent. The degree of a vertex v.
deg(v). is the number of edges which have v as one of its endpoints. If V(G)
has v elements and E(G) has e elements. then the average degree of a graph
is deﬁned as d(G) =2e/v.

A subgraph of G=(V,E) is a graph F=(V’,E’) whose vertex set V’ E V
and its edge set E’ EE connects only nodes of V’. The maximum average
degree. m(G). of a graph G is the largest average degree over all subgraphs of
G. A subgraph F of G is said to be induced by V’ if and only if it includes all
the edges of G which connect the vertices of V’. i.e. for each pair of vertices
in F and their corresponding pair in G. there will be an edge between a pair
of vertices in F if there is an edge between the corresponding pair in G. Two
graphs are said to be isomorphic if there is a one-to-one mapping f between
the vertex sets of G and H such that vertices v and w are adjacent in H if
and only if f (v) and f (w) are adjacent in G. For more background on random
graphs. see for example Bollobas (2001).

In this article. we deﬁne the graph density p of a graph G. with v vertices
and e edges. as the ratio between the number of edges e and the number of
potential edges of G. i.e. p=e/ 

2.3 Random graph models

In this article. we focus on the following random graph models: ER (Erdos
and Rényi. 1960). ER with the same degree distribution (ER-DD) as the
input graph. and GEO3D (see for example Penrose. 2003).

The ER random graph model. Gmm. has n labelled nodes connected by
m edges which are randomly chosen from the n(n—1)/2 possible edges
(Erdos and Rényi. 1960). In this model the choice of an edge is not entirely
independent of the choice of another edge (Bollobas. 2001).

ER-DD is a variation of this model. it has not just the same number
of nodes and edges as the input PPI network. but also the same degree
distribution.

GEO3D random graphs are constructed by assigning each node random
coordinates in a 3D box of unit volume. i.e. coordinates are drawn from a
uniform distribution on the unit interval (see for example Penrose. 2003).
Points in the box will then correspond to graph nodes. and two nodes will be
connected by an edge if the Euclidean distance between them is at most r.

2.4 Thresholds for subgraph appearances

Many theoretical properties of graphs change dramatically in a narrow range
of m. which lead to the concept of threshold functions (Erdos and Rényi.
1960). If Q is a graph property. P(Q) denotes the probability that G(n,m)
has or belongs to Q. We say that almost every graph in G(n,M(n)) has the
property Q if P(Q) —> 1 as n —> 00. For a given monotone increasing property
Q (such as the appearance of a certain subgraph). we deﬁne a threshold
function t(n) for Q as any function which satisﬁes

[mm—>0, and P(Q)—>1 if M900

P(Q)—>0 if t(n) t(n)

The expectation values for ER graphs with 500 and 2000 vertices are represented as
arrows along the x-axis in Figure 3A.

Threshold functions are not unique although they are so within certain factors
(Bollobas. 2001. p. 40). For the random graph model G(n, M (n)). it is possible
to show that the threshold function for the property of containing a ﬁxed. non-
empty graph F is n2_2/’". where m=m(F) is the maximum average degree
of F (see Bollobas. 2001. p. 89). We relate M (n) and the graph density p Via
p = May (3).

For the ER model it is possible and more informative to calculate the graph
density such that the expected number of copies of a given subgraph F is
approximately 1. For a subgraph on v vertices with e edges. the approximate
expected count for the subgraph under the ER model is

E(number of occurrences): A ~ nV pg / v1,

for small p. When the number of occurrences is well approximated by
a Poisson random variable. as in the case for balanced graphs. P(no
occurrence of subgraph) ~ 1 —e_)‘ ~ A and hence the threshold function
and the expectation formula coincide. The graph density values where
the expected number of counts of a speciﬁc graphlet of Figure 1 is
approximately 1 (i.e. A = 1). are given in Table 2. The values decrease with
increasing number of vertices.

Threshold functions for GEO3D models are not so well understood. One
can. nonetheless. calculate approximate threshold values for the appearance
of induced graphlets with k vertices. Penrose (2003) showed that for arandom
geometric graph placed in Rd with n vertices and a radius r. the k-Vertices
subgraph count satisﬁes a Poisson limit when the product nk WM”) tends to
a ﬁnite constant. The radius r can be related to the average degree at by using

2.5 GraphCrunch

The random graphs used in our experiments were generated using the internal
generators of GraphCrunch. GraphCrunch (Milenkovic et al.. 2008) is an
open source software tool that compares large real-world networks with
random graph models. These are automatically generated to have the same
number of nodes and edges (to within 1%) as those of the real-world network
being compared. This has to be taken as approximate; with a simple 12-star
as input. ER-DD graphs with 10. 11 and 12 edges are generated. As well
as many global standard properties. the software supports the local statistics
RGF distance and GDDA. Recently. the software has been used for a wide
range of applications among which are assessing parametric models for PPI
networks (Przulj. 2007). protein structure networks (Milenkovic et al.. 2009)
and brain functional networks (Kuchaiev et al.. 2009).

2.6 GDDA

GDDA (Przulj. 2007) is based on orbit degree distributions. which are
based on the automorphism orbits of the 29 graphlets on 275 vertices. as
follows. Automorphisms are edge-preserving bijections from a graph to
itself. and together they form a permutation group. An automorphism orbit
is a node that represents this group. Within the 29 graphlets. 73 different
orbits can be found (Fig. 1) and each one will have an associated orbit
degree distribution. An orbit i from graphlet Gj has orbit degree k in the
graph G if there are k copies of Gj in G which involve orbit i. In Przulj
(2007) the term graphlet degree distribution is used instead of orbit degree
distribution. but as orbits are counted. in our View the latter term is more
appropriate. For example. considering a simple 2-star graph as our main

graph G (graphlet G1 in Fig. 1). we would have an orbit degree distribution
for orbit 0 (an edge) of two node counts for orbit degree 1 (the outer two
nodes) and one count for an orbit degree 2 (the middle node); the orbit degree
distribution of orbit 1 would be two counts for an orbit degree 1. and for
orbit 2 we would have one count for an orbit degree 1. Let d/G(k) be the
sample distribution of the node counts for a given orbit degree k in a graph
G and for a particular automorphism orbit j. In our example. where G: G1.
we obtain dg1=(2,1,0,...,0);dgl=(2,0,0,...,0);d51=(1,0,0,...,0); and

The software also calculates a variant of GDDA using the geometric mean

A typical output based on GDDA generated by GraphCrunch is shown in
Figure 2. Six PPI networks were considered; two yeast and four human. The
query networks were compared with 100 random graphs of each modeliER.
ER-DD and GEoiwhich were automatically generated by GraphCrunch.

2.7 Empirical distributions of GDDA

To address how to interpret the output from a graph comparison based on
GDDA. ﬁrst for both the ER model and the GEO3D model. graphs of 500.
1000 and 2000 vertices with increasing graph density were generated using
the internal generators from GraphCrunch. The graphs were subsequently
used as query networks in the software and compared with 50 networks of
the same model. to ascertain typical GDDA scores if the model is correct.

2.8 Assessing model ﬁt

As GDDA scores are not normally distributed in the graph density region
of interest. to assess whether a given query network ﬁts a particular model
network we resort to non-parametric procedures. Given an input graph with
n vertices and e edges. and a random graph model 1.

(1) Generate M graphs. say M :99. from model 1 with about n vertices
and e edges.

(2) For each one of these. carry out comparisons with N graphs generated
from the same model and record GDDA; call the result SampleA. Here
we use N = 99.

(3) Calculate the GDDA between the input graph and the N graphs from
model 1. call the result Sample B.

(4) A histogram of Sample A versus Sample B may already show a clear
separation of the two samples. making it obvious that the suggested
model 1 is not a good ﬁt. see Figure 4 for an illustration.

(5) For a statistical test. which tests for the null hypothesis that the
two samples come from the same distributions against the general
alternative that the distributions of the two samples are not the same.
we employ a Monte Carlo test (see Supplementary Material for
details). Here. Sample A records M averages of the N comparisons.
whereas Sample B consists of one observation: the average GDDA
over the N comparisons of the input network versus model. The lowest
obtainable P-Value is then 1 / (M + 1).

(6) We also employ a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. which tests for the
alternative that the distribution of Sample A is a shifted version of
the distribution of Sample B (Supplementary Material). This test is
more powerful than the Monte Carlo test. but tests against a less
general alternative.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

First, PPI networks were compared with random model networks
using GDDA and the standard GraphCrunch output (Fig. 2). The
plot shows the highest GDDA for the GEO3D random graph
model type for all the networks, followed by ER-DD and ER
models. While Przulj (2007) would now conclude that GEO3D
is the best ﬁtting model for PPI networks, we shall see that due
to the threshold behaviour of the networks such conclusion is not
statistically justiﬁable.

According to Przulj (2007), a perfect score can be achieved when
comparing networks of the same random model type. Przulj (2007)
found the mean GDDA of comparing ER versus ER, ER-DD versus
ER-DD or GEO-3D versus GEO-3D to be 0.84:l:0.07, where 0.07
denotes one stande error. This was updated in Przulj (2010) where
they found the highest score for two GEO-3D networks to be 0.95 :I:
0.002.

The results for comparing ER versus ER and GEO3D versus
GEO3D networks with 500, 1000 and 2000 nodes across a wide
range of graph densities are summarized in Figure 3 using GDDA.
Similar results for GDDA with geometric mean and for RGF-
distance can be found in the Supplementary Material.

In contrast to Przulj (2007), we ﬁnd that the GDDA values have
not only striking differences amongst different model types but also
a pronounced dependency on the number of vertices of the network.
For a speciﬁc graph, drawn from one model type and with a ﬁxed
number of vertices, we also observe a strong dependency of the
GDDA score with graph density when comparing to graphs of the
same type and with the same number of vertices. Furthermore, these
dependencies are not monotone. For easier readability and because

GEO3D versus GEO3D (B) graphs with 500. 1000 and 2000 vertices are
plotted against graph density. Each value represents the average agreement
of 50 networks. The graph densities of the PPI networks considered (Table 1)
are indicated on the top x-axis. In (A). the graph density values where the
expected number of occurrences of a speciﬁc graphlet is approximately equal
to one. for an ER graph with 500 and 2000 nodes. respectively. are indicated
by the short and long arrows along the x-axis. In (B). the thresholds for the
appearance of 3-node graphlets are indicated for the GEO3D graphs with
500. 1000 and 2000 nodes.

a normal approximation does not hold, we omit the error bars from
the plots of Figure 3.

In Figure 3A, for ER versus ER comparisons, in the region of
graph density 0—0.01 we observe high volatility in the GDDA score,
after which it increases with the graph density (Supplementary
Material). This volatility may be related to the natural appearance of
small subgraphs, which is itself dependent on the number of nodes.
Threshold functions for the property of containing one speciﬁc
graphlet were deﬁned and calculated for ER networks with 500, 1000
and 2000 vertices (Table 2). The threshold values of the different
3—5 node graphlets for an ER graph with 500 and 2000 vertices are
indicated in Figure 3A. For all graphs tested, the instability region
in the GDDA score includes most of these thresholds.

For GEO3D versus GEO3D comparisons, one sees an instability
in the score for small graph density which, after recovery, seems to
slowly decrease again. Comparisons of GEO3D with 500 vertices
for higher graph densities (up to 0.4) suggest that the score becomes
more stable, although slowly increasing (Supplementary Material).
While in ER graphs edges are near-independent, this is not true for
GEO3D graphs because, in a geometric setting, if an edge i is close
toj and ifj is close to k, then i is likely to be close to k (Penrose,
2003). The asymptotic results also appear to be related to the score
instability (Table 3; Fig. 3B). The most dramatic change in the score
occurs when 3-node subgraphs start to appear; the appearance of
4- and S-node subgraphs seems to have a much lower inﬂuence on
the score. Strikingly, all the PPI networks under consideration are
in the region of graph density populated by thresholds in both ER
and GEO3D models. This invites the conjecture that PPI networks
operate near the threshold for appearance of small subgraphs.
Unfortunately, no good model yet exists of PPI networks and so
further work will be needed to conﬁrm this conjecture.

It is worth noting that the speciﬁc GDDA values presented in
Figure 3 may vary, precisely because the speciﬁc graphs being
generated for a particular comparison can be very diverse, especially
in the region of high volatility (graph density between 0—0.01).

The instability of GDDA scores makes it difﬁcult to interpret
the output presented in Figure 2, not just because the typical score
is different for each model type, but also because it is a function
of the number of vertices and edges of the speciﬁc network being
analysed. We ﬁnd that the empirical distribution of GDDA in the
region of interest, even in model versus model comparison, is not
close to normal, indeed not even unimodal. This again can be
explained by the network parameters being close to thresholds for
the appearance of small subgraphs. Thus, this threshold behaviour
seriously affects the statistical inference from subgraph counts for
network comparison and the conclusions which can be drawn from
such subgraph count comparison.

Hence, for assessing the model ﬁt based on GDDA, we propose a
new protocol. Several same model versus model comparisons with
roughly the same number of vertices and edges should be carried
out in order to assess the best obtainable score for this speciﬁc
case. GDDA should then be calculated between the query network
and graphs from the model network. Model ﬁt can be evaluated
by gauging the differences between the distributions of agreement
scores resulting from query network versus model and model versus
model comparisons. We suggest the Monte Carlo non-parametric
test for assessing whether the two independent samples of GDDA
scores, one resulting from comparisons between query network
versus model and the other from model versus model, come from
the same distribution. Alternatively, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test can
be employed (Supplementary Material).

Figure 4A and B shows histograms of GDDA values for
comparisons between the PPI network BG-MS versus 99 GEO3D
and 99 ER-DD model networks, respectively. Both models have
a zero Wilcoxon P-value (there is no overlap between the
distributions). A Monte Carlo test was performed with 999 values,
each an average of 30 model versus model agreements (M =999,
N :30). In both cases a P-value of 0.001 was obtained, which is
the smallest possible P-value for this test with 1000 observations.
Although the mean of the empirical distribution is closer to
ER-DD than to GEO-3D, the means are too far away to draw
any useful conclusions. The large distances instead point to both

models being inadequate and incommensurable to the network under
consideration. Hence, we conclude that neither of the models ﬁt the
data.

To verify that our method is indeed capable of classifying a
network, we took a GEO3D graph as input and compared it with
other GEO3D networks (Fig. 4C). The distribution overlap is clear
and the Monte Carlo test gives a P-value of 0.24 (M :99, N =99).
Figure 4C also illustrates the possible bias that can occur when just
one model graph is used in same model versus model comparison.
We emphasize that the graphs used for Figure 4C have the same
number of vertices and graph density as BG-MS, and hence they are
also in the threshold region, which may account for the relatively
low P-value. We also report the GDDA values when one compares
an ER-DD query network with ER model networks to show how the
method behaves for two closely related models (Fig. 4D). A large
overlap between the GDDA values is observed. The P-value for the
Monte Carlo test with 100 values (M = 99, N = 99) is 0.15; hence for
a single graph from the ER-DD model, our method cannot reject at
the 10% level the (reasonable) null hypothesis that the graph comes
from an ER model. Another random graph model designed to model
PPIs where edges are drawn between every two vertices according to
their degree (Przulj and Higham, 2006) was also tested with similar
results (Supplementary Material); ﬁiture work will include assessing
the ﬁt to other models, such as ER mixture models (Daudin et (11.,
2008).

In our analysis, we have found that none of the theoretical
models considered is suitable for the PPI networks analysed

(see Supplementary Material for the P-values and histograms
obtained for the other ﬁve PPI networks). However, we provide
a statistical framework for comparing real-world networks to other
theoretical models using non-parametric statistics.

Our results on GDDA scores suggest that PPI networks are
situated in a region of graph density close to the threshold behaviour
of the models analysed. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has ~6600
protein-coding genes (www.yeastgenome.org) and is predicted to
have about 25 000—35 000 interactions (Stumpf et (11., 2008); such
a network would have a graph density between 0.0011 and 0.0016.
For H.s(1piens, estimates of about 25 000 genes (Human Genome
Project) and 650000 PPI (Stumpf et (11., 2008) would also lead to
graph densities around 0.002. Both these networks would be placed
in the threshold region for the appearance of G3 as well as G17—G27
under the ER model. This may suggest that globally many pathways
between proteins are essentially unique, with just a few alternative
routes; cliques of size 4 and most graphlets on ﬁve vertices are
unlikely to appear. Such an architecture would render the network
both efﬁcient (not too many edges) and robust (alternative pathways
are available).

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that typical values of GDDA, gauged by same
model comparison, depend on the number of edges and nodes of
the underlying graph.

Effect of threshold behaviour

 

We propose a statistical method for assessing model ﬁt based
on GDDA. Although none of the suggested models ﬁt any of the
datasets, we provide the basis for statistical comparison with other
models.

The GDDA score is particularly unstable in the graph density
region between 0 and 0.01, which encompasses most of the PPI
networks currently available. We provide the plausible explanation
that this is due to thresholds for the appearance of small subgraphs.

Using these thresholds in ER and GEO3D models as proxy,
we suggest that PPI networks themselves tend to operate near
the thresholds for the appearance of small subgraphs. That is, the
network will start to have a few alternative paths between proteins,
but not many. This observation may lead to further conjectures about
optimal design of networks, accounting for these critical regimes.

ABSTRACT

Summary: With the increasing amount of newly discovered
non-coding RNAs, the interactions between RNA molecules become
an increasingly important aspect for characterizing their functionality.
Many computational tools have been developed to predict the forma-
tion of duplexes between two RNAs, either based on single sequences
or alignments of homologous sequences. Here, we present RILogo, a
program to visualize inter- and intramolecular base pairing between
two RNA molecules. The input for RILogo is a pair of structure-
annotated sequences or alignments. In the latter case, RILogo dis-
plays the alignments in the form of sequence logos, including the
mutual information of base paired columns. We also introduce two
novel mutual information based measures that weigh the covariance
information by the evolutionary distances of the aligned sequences.
We show that the new measures have an increased accuracy com-
pared with previous mutual information measures.

Availability and implementation: RILogo is freely available as a
stand-alone program and is accessible via a web server at http://rth

1 INTRODUCTION

An increasing amount of functional non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) has been identiﬁed in recent years and computational
predictions of possibly functional structured RNAs yield vast
amounts of candidate RNA genes (Gorodkin et al., 2010).
Typically, RNA molecules interact with proteins or with other
RNA molecules (including messenger RNAs) by forming inter-
molecular duplexes. Computational predictions of RNAiRNA
interactions usually follow the thermodynamic energy models for
the secondary structure prediction of a single RNA sequence.
Algorithms for the simultaneous prediction of intra- and inter-
molecular structure between two given sequences have a higher
prediction accuracy, but also have a high time complexity
(Bernhart et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2009). Another class of al-
gorithms only focuses on the prediction of intermolecular
duplexes between two RNA sequences, while neglecting possible
intramolecular base pairings, and achieves linear time complexity
in the best case (Tafer and Hofacker, 2008; Wenzel et al, 2012).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

When several homologous sequences are available, consensus
structure prediction methods can also be applied for predicting
intermolecular base pairs. For example, PETcof old (Seemann
et al., 201 la) first predicts intra-molecular pairing and afterwards
intermolecular pairing in the previously unpaired regions.
Another approach also based on multiple sequence alignments
is ripalign (Li et al., 2011), which computes inter- and intra-
molecular base pairs simultaneously using a partition function
algorithm.

The sequence pattern of a given multiple DNA or protein
alignment is easily Visualized by sequence logos (Schneider and
Stephens, 1990). Each alignment column is represented by a
stack of letters from the DNA/protein alphabets, where the over-
all height of the stack denotes the Shannon information content
of that position and the size of a letter denotes its frequency in
that column. The most frequent letter is placed on top of the
stack. Several programs were developed to automatically create
sequence logos from a given input alignment (Beitz, 2000;
Crooks et al., 2004).

When studying RNA alignments, the secondary structure of
the RNAs needs to be considered. Structure logos (Gorodkin
et al., 1997) include the annotation of base pairing and the
mutual information (M1) of two paired alignment positions in
the logo itself. Single or consensus RNA structures are usually
plotted in a circular planar graph (Auber et al., 2006), e. g. VARNA
(Darty et al., 2009) or R2R (Weinberg and Breaker, 2011).
RNALogo (Chang et al., 2008) combines a planar plot of the
consensus secondary structure with stacks of letters for each
base and displays the M1 of base pairs. 3D logos are plotted by
Correlogo (Bindewald et al., 2006). However, these programs
do not include RNAiRNA interactions. RNA structures and
interactions can be Visualized by arcs or lines connecting pairing
bases in their primary sequences, e. g. in Huang et a]. (2009).

Here, we introduce RILogo, which combines sequence logos
with an arc representation of the secondary structure of both
intra- and intermolecular base pairs of two interacting RNA
genes. Additionally, the M1 of base pairs is calculated and
included in the logo by colouring the arcs or adding an ‘M’
character on top of the letter stacks, with a height corresponding
to the MI. It has been suggested that measures including phylo-
genetic information are the most powerful (Akmaev et al., 2000).
However, the widely used measures ignore information from the
phylogenetic relationships between the sequences (Lindgreen
et al., 2006). Thus, we introduce two novel mutual information
based measures, which use pairwise evolutionary distances be-
tween sequences in order to give different weights to the

covariance information contained in individual sequences from
the alignment.

An early version of RILogo was previously used to display
structure predictions in the PETco fold web server (Seemann
et al., 2011b). Here, we make the enhanced version of RILogo
available both as a stand-alone program and Via a web server. It
now includes our new evolutionary mutual information mea-
sures, customization options and is freely available under the
GNU LGPL.

2 IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS

2.1 RNA interaction logos

The input to RILogo is a pair of multiple structural RNA align-
ments or single sequences, including a consensus secondary struc-
ture annotation, which is allowed to contain pseudoknots. From
the input alignments, two sequence logos are calculated and
plotted one above the other, with the second logo displayed in
3/- to 5/-orientation (Fig. l). Intramolecular base pairs are dis-
played by arcs in each logo. The are representation of an RNA
secondary structure is formally a graph with bases represented as
nodes and base pairings as edges, where the nodes are displayed
alongside each other while the edges are drawn as connecting
arcs. Pseudoknots can easily be spotted as crossing arcs. Each
arc is coloured by a gradient that denotes the M1 of the under-
lying base pair. Intermolecular base pairing is displayed by
straight lines between the respective columns of the two sequence
logos. Both logos are horizontally arranged in a way, so that the
average distance between interacting bases is minimized.
RILogo’s native output is an SVG file. The web server addition-
ally provides other vector and bitmap output formats. Figure 1
shows an example for the interaction of the bacterial sRNA
OxyS and its target site in the thA mRNA.

2.2 Evolutionary-based MI measure

RILogo implements two novel measures for covariance of base
pairs. The standard measure, an adaptation of the Kullbacki
Leibler divergence to base pairs, is defined for two alignment
columns 1' and j as
0r (1 — 01")
MI,-- 2 Oi-log —/+ (1 — 0,") log —/ (1)
J J 2  J 2  _ 
where 0,-1- is the frequency of observed base pairs and E)!- of ex-
pected base pairs (Gorodkin et al., 1997). The frequencies of
canonical base pairs at columns 1' and j are counted as

0,, = ﬁ 2 cars, sf);  = ﬁ 2 cars.) - Z we) (2)
s65 seS seS

where S is the set of all sequences, N = |S| and s,- is the ith base in
sequence s. The term CA, is the phylogenetic distance to the other
sequences described below in equation (3). 6(si, S) is 1 if (s), sj) is
a canonical base pair and 0 otherwise. 6(si) is 1 if s,- is equal to
any I,- that forms a canonical base pair (ti, tj) where t e S and 0
otherwise. We deﬁne canonical base pairs as G:C, CzG, GzU,
UzG, AU and U:A. Note that M1,]- strictly speaking is not a
mutual information measure, but a distance between the quan-
tities 0,-1- and El]- measuring observed and expected covariance of

base changes between columns 1' and j. Here, we do not strictly
distinguish between ‘mutual information’ and ‘distance’.
Lindgreen et a]. (2006) compared M1 with other alternative
measures and showed that MIWOP is the best measure that
does not include the structural context of base pairs. MIWOP
uses only canonical base pairs and includes gap penalties by
replacing the second summand in equation (1) with the term
—N§ - )3 (see Supplementary material). Other types of gap cor-
rections have been applied as well (Hertz et al., 1990). By adding
this ad hoc gap correction, the M1,]- can be <0 when columns 1'
and j contain many gaps. Thus, it is not a strict information
measure in the classical sense, and we refer to it as an approx-
imate mutual information measure or approximate Kullbacki
Leibler distance. However, the gap correction has empirically
been shown to increase the accuracy of the M1,]- (Lindgreen
et al., 2006) and in practical applications, as also done in
RILogo, a negative M1,]- will be set to zero. Without gap correc-
tion and in the special case with equiprobable background fre-
quencies for all base pairs, M1,]- reduces to a classical Shannon
style information content. A known drawback of M1 and MIWOP
is that structurally neutral substitutions of one base within a base
pair (e. g. G:C to G:U) do not contribute to the mutual informa-
tion. Additionally, a phylogenetic bias in the sequence alignment
can distort the individual contributions from each sequence. For
example, compensatory base pair changes between sequences of
high evolutionary distance are likely to happen. In contrast, com-
pensatory substitutions in closely related sequences are less likely
and, thus, contribute more information.

Hence, we introduce two new measures, treeMI and
treeMIWOP, which weigh the base pair frequencies using aver-
aged pairwise phylogenetic distances. While CS 2 l for all s in
M1 and MIWOP in equation (2), we deﬁne CA, in treeMI and
treeMIWOP as

Cs 2 1 _ davg(S)/Nd 

where davg(s) is the average pairwise distance from sequence 3 to
all other sequences in the tree and Nd is defined as stavg(s).
This gives a higher weight to sequences that are phylogenetically
proximal to all other sequences and less weight to more distant
sequences. The normalization by the number of sequences N in
equation (2) results in treeMI>0 also for fully conserved col-
umns, which would not be the case if N = 2s CK. Both MIWOP
and treeMIWOP give values in the interval {—1.0, 2.0}, with —1
when each base pair for a given column contains one gap. The
maximum of 2.0 bit is achieved when exactly the six possible base
pairs are present. The M1 is displayed by an additional letter M
(with height MIl'j/ 2) in the sequence logos, as in Gorodkin et a].
(1997). The total height of a letter stack (y-axis) can exceed 2 bit,
since it sums up two measures, Shannon Information and
(approximate) mutual information. An alternative (and more
rigorous way of) display could be a 3D plot with the measures
on respective axes.

For evaluation, we compared treeMI and treeMI Wop with M1
and MIWOP based on how well they discriminate between true
and false base pairs. For this comparison, we selected a set of 961
structure-annotated RNA alignments from Rfam 10.1 (Gardner
et al., 2011), by keeping only those with at least ﬁve sequences,
average pairwise sequence identity (PID) 5 90%, and removed

Fig. 1. Output of RILogo showing a sequence logo for bacterial RNA orthologs of the small RNA OxyS and its target thA [alignments from Huang
et a]. (2009)]. Intramolecular (arcs) and intermolecular (lines) base pairs are coloured by their mutual information using treeMI Wop in log-scale. The y-
axes show the summed information content (in bits) of the conservation for each position (the relative entropy) and its contribution to the (approximate)

mutual information

redundant sequences with 3 99% similarity. Phylogenetic trees
were inferred from the alignments with FastTree2 (Price et al.,
2010), which were then used to calculate d4,Vg in treeMI and
treeMIWOP. Like Lindgreen et a]. (2006), we calculate the best
Matthews Correlation Coefﬁcient (MCC; Matthews, 1975) for
each alignment, where the best MCC is derived from the MI
score that differentiates most accurate between annotated base
pairs and unpaired bases.

Both treeMI and treeMIWOP identiﬁed annotated base pairs
better than MI and MIWOP, with an average MCC of 0.238 for
treeMI and 0.241 for treeMIWOP, compared to an average MCC
of 0.181 for M1 and 0.217 for MIWOP. Figure 2a shows that
treeMI captures the covariation within most alignments better
than MI which results in better predictions (higher MCCs) of the
annotated base pairs. By excluding those alignments with very
low base pair prediction accuracy (MCC <0.1), the information
gained by phylogeny even increases: average MCC (M1) = 0.315,
average MCC (treeMI)=0.395. Additionally, we observed that
treeMI gives better results than treeMI Wop for MCC >0.3, while
treeMI Wop is better than treeMI for lower MCC (Fig. 2b), due to
the little covariation in these alignments. In contrast, MIWOP
gives higher MCCs than MI, as already observed in Lindgreen
et al. (2006) (see Supplementary Fig. 1).

The average PID is negatively correlated to the alignment co-
variance, and thus, to the information that can be gained by the
MI measure. By taking weights for evolutionary distances into
account, however, treeMIWOP improves MIWOP in alignments
with higher average PID, where less covariance is available (see
Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 1). In contrast, alignments with
highly divergent sequences carry more covariance information,
so that there is less improvement by including evolutionary dis-
tances. Supplementary Table 1 shows that treeMI performs
better than treeMIWOP for alignments with low average PID,
because it also includes non-canonical base pairing in the
mutual information measure.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Biomedical ontologies are often very large and complex.
Only a subset of the ontology may be needed for a specified applica-
tion or community. For ontology end users, it is desirable to have
community-based labels rather than the labels generated by ontology
developers. Ontodog is a web-based system that can generate an
ontology subset based on Excel input, and support generation of an
ontology community view, which is defined as the whole or a subset of
the source ontology with user-specified annotations including user-
preferred labels. Ontodog allows users to easily generate community
views with minimal ontology knowledge and no programming skills or
installation required. Currently >100 ontologies including all OBO
Foundry ontologies are available to generate the views based
on user needs. We demonstrate the application of Ontodog for the
generation of community views using the Ontology for Biomedical
Investigations as the source ontology.

1 INTRODUCTION

A biomedical reference ontology represents an agreed upon
understanding of terms and relations between terms in a speciﬁc
domain and is often developed collaboratively by various com-
munities. Reference ontologies can be very large and complex.
With large ontologies, it is not efficient to work with the entire
reference ontology for an application when only a part of
the ontology is used. For example, the Gene Ontology (GO)
(Ashburner, 2000) contains >30 000 terms to support consistent
annotation of gene and gene product attributes across various
species. For a particular model organism, only a part of GO
relevant to that speciﬁed organism is needed. The G0 slim mech-
anism has been developed for meeting this need (http://www.
geneontology.org/GO.slims.shtml). Slim is a cut-down version
of an ontology containing a subset of terms defined in the ontol-
ogy according to users’ needs. An implementation of the slim
mechanism using a Perl script is available. However, the script
only works for ontologies using the OBO format. The Ontoviews
project aims to build application-oriented ontologies based on an
‘ontology View’, deﬁned as a set of ontology terms retrieved from

input ontologies through a SPARQL-based query, and may not
be a subset of one ontology (Detwiler and Brinkley, 2011) . That
project has not developed tools for users without programming
skills to retrieve a subset of an ontology based on their needs.
Ontology term labels are generally chosen for ontological clar-
ity and may not be end user (i.e. biologist) friendly. Here we
deﬁne ‘ontology community View’ as a whole or a portion of
the ontology that maintains textual and logical term deﬁnitions
and provides additional user-speciﬁed annotations including
user-preferred labels. The community Views are dependent on
the source ontology. With changes in the source ontology, the
Views might be affected and require updating to reﬂect the latest
changes in the source ontology which may occur frequently. To
facilitate ontology community View generation, we have gener-
ated a web-based tool Ontodog (http://ontodog.hegroup.org/).

2 FEATURES AND USAGE

Ontodog is implemented using a three-tier system architecture
(Fig. 1A). At the front-end, input data are collected using web
forms in HTML format. It collects source ontology information
and tagged terms of interest. Terms of interest and user-speciﬁed
annotations, e.g. user-preferred labels, are provided either in a
tab-delimited or Excel format file. Ontodog provides a template
for generation of this input term file. The template contains all
classes and properties in the source ontology. The input data are
then processed using PHP and Java with OWLAPI. SPARQL
queries are executed in a web server (middle-tier, application
server) against an RDF triple store (back-end, database server)
for subset extraction. The default RDF triple store used in
Ontodog is the SPARQL endpoint for the RDF triple store
hosted by He Group (http://sparql.hegroup.org). This RDF
triple store contains all the OBO Foundry ontologies and auto-
matically reloads any updates of ontologies every day. The
Ontodog outputs are RDF/XML ﬁles that can be Viewed and
downloaded. As a web-based system, Ontodog is accessible any-
where with internet, and does not require any software installa-
tion. Ontodog uses OWL-DL as the default ontology format.
The OntoFox SPARQL-related term-retrieval approach
0(iang, 2010) is adopted in Ontodog for ontology subset extrac-
tion to retrieve terms of interest and all relevant terms based on
logical axioms. The retrieved subset maintains both textual and
logical deﬁnitions of terms and preserves reasoning consistency.
New annotation properties, such as community preferred
labels, are kept in a separate ontology ﬁle. The extra annotation
property layers can be imported to the source ontology or a

subset of it using the OWL import mechanism (Fig. 1B). The
layer approach allows the annotation properties to be reused
and provides extra ﬂexibilities based on a user’s needs.
Ontodog allows users to tag terms of interests using annotation,
obozinSubset, which has been used by GO slim to indicate that a
term is a member of a subset of interest to a speciﬁc application
or community and enable subset extraction using logical queries
based on annotation. In addition, the annotation values are not
limited to the English language. Ontodog allows users to add
labels in four other languages, including Chinese, French,
German and Spanish. Details of Ontodog output files and how
to use them are provided on the Ontodog tutorial page: http://
ontodog.hegroup.org/tutorial/index.php.

Ontodog can be used to generate an ontology subset for new
ontology development. For example, Ontodog was recently used
to retrieve a subset of the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations
(OBI) (Brinkman, 2010) as a basis to build the Beta Cell
Genomics Ontology (BCGO) (Zheng, 2013). OBI has been de-
veloped collaboratively by >20 different communities to support
consistent annotations of all aspects of biological investigations.

For each application/community, a portion of OBI is needed
with many user-preferred labels (instead of default OBI labels)
desired. Ontodog has a unique feature of using an Excel
input ﬁle.

A more advanced feature of Ontodog is the support of com-
munity View generation. For example, Ontodog was used to gen-
erate a community View of OBI for the Functional Genomics
Data Society (FGED) (http://www.fged.org/). For the FGED
community users, only a subset of OBI is needed for description
of their experiments. In addition, these users want to have their
own labels for terms. For example, ‘selectively maintained or-
ganism’ is used to describe a population of organisms of the same
species with distinctive characteristics and generally obtained
using breeding. The label given in OBI reﬂects the consensus
choice of developers from different communities. However, it is
less meaningful for most biology users than the terms ‘strain,
cultivar, or ecotype’. The FGED community View of OBI
was generated by Ontodog (http:/ /bioporta1.bioontology.org/
ontologies/43109). In total, 2279 classes were extracted from
OBI (which has 3501 classes). The community View was built
by importing an inSubset annotation properties OWL ﬁle
(added inSubset annotation of ‘FGED’) and a community pre-
ferred label properties OWL file (added FGED alternative term
for a term) into the retrieved subset of OBI (Fig. 1C). The two
OWL ﬁles can also be exported to the source ontology OBI to
show OBI users which terms and labels the FGED community
would prefer to use. It is noted that one term may have many
meanings for different communities. The use of community-
preferred labels will solve the problem.

Ontodog was also used to generate an OBI community View
for the OBI web service community (Guttula, 2011). The com-
munity View contains 228 OBI classes. The reduced size and
complexity of this community View led to improved efﬁciency
in annotation and semantic similarity computation.

3 SUMMARY

Ontodog is a web system that generates an ontology View with
customized annotation. It is easy to use by ontology developers,
including those who are mostly domain experts and who might
not have deep ontology knowledge or programming skills.
Currently, Ontodog only supports OBO Foundry ontologies.

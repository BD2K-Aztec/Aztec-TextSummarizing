processed by both humans and computers. Squepot fills this
gap with the overarching goals of being both comprehensive and
extremely simple to use.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

All data are stored in a MongoDB (http://mongodb.org) data—
base. An ‘Aseq’ia unique amino acid sequence regardless of its
source or specieswonstitutes the core document entity. Each
Aseq is uniquely identified by an ‘Aseq ID’ (amino acid sequence
identiﬁer%a 22—character string derived by encoding the binary
MD5 digest of the uppercase sequence characters with a slightly
modiﬁed Base64 scheme. This scheme removes terminal padding
characters and converts all forward slashes and plus signs to
URL ‘friendly’ underscores and dashes, respectively. Each
Aseq contains basic descriptors including its sequence, length
and status. Aseqs are further decorated with predicted features
and external database references.

Raw sequences and precomputed features hosted by the
SIMAP project (Rattei et al., 2010) are downloaded, parsed
and inserted into the database. Identiﬁers and sequences con—
tained in the NCBI non—redundant, UniProt (Consortium,
2012) and Protein Data Bank (Rose et al., 2013) databases are
subsequently merged to provide additional coverage and cross—
referencing capabilities. Adding to the many predictive features
precomputed by SIMAP (Rattei et al., 2010), we also predict
transmembrane regions with the Dense Alignment Surface TM
ﬁlter (Cserzo et al., 2003) and Extra Cytoplasmic Function
domains (Staron et al., 2009). The entire database is publicly
accessible via a RESTful (Epresentational state transfer)
Application Programming Interface (API). Updates are per—
formed on a quarterly basis to integrate novel sequences and
associated features. This includes refreshing precomputed data
with results from current versions of each feature prediction tool.

3 FEATURES

3.1 Comprehensive

Squepot contains >28.5 million unique amino acid sequences
sourced from major sequence databases and >300 million intrin—
sic features.

3.2 Non-redundant

By deﬁnition, all Aseqs are non—redundant and source—agnostic.
Thus, all derived data associated with a speciﬁc sequence is easily
consolidated in a single document.

3.3 Intrinsic identiﬁers

Aseq IDs solely depend on the full—length ungapped sequence
characters (i.e. intrinsic) and may be easily generated independ—
ent of any external database. Such universally unique and size—
efﬁcient identiﬁers are permanently stable and ideal for mapping
sequences between databases.

3.4 Flexible well-documented RESTful API

The REST API encapsulates the gateway to all data within
Squepot and has been designed to make accessing, visualizing

and consuming relevant data extremely easy. The data for any
given Aseq may be retrieved by requesting a URI with the gen—
eral form http://seqdepot.net/api/v1/aseqs/{id}.{format}?{par—
ameters}, where {id} is a supported identiﬁer type, {format} is
the desired output format (json, png or svg for JSON, PNG
image or SVG image, respectively) and {parameters} optionally
modiﬁes the response (e. g. limit the fields returned). To visualize
the domain architecture for a sequence, simply replace {format}
with either png or svg to produce a PNG or SVG image ﬁle of
the predicted biological elements. Textual results and error mes—
sages are encoded in J SON (http://json.org). Virtually every pro—
gramming language contains libraries for transforming JSON
encoded data into native data structures with a few lines of
code. This completely circumvents the need to write custom par—
sers and requires minimal effort to process results in downstream
applications. Complete documentation covering all aspects of the
REST API including several examples is located at http://seqde
pot.net/api.

3.5 Visualization

Generate raster or vector images visualizing the full domain
architecture for any Aseq.

3.6 Bulk querying
Supports up to 1000 queries per request.

3.7 Cross-referencing

Aseqs may also be referenced using the hexadecimal MD5 digest
of the sequence or a variety of external database identiﬁers
including UniProt (Consortium, 2012), GenBank (GI) or
Protein Data Bank (Rose et al., 2013) identiﬁers.

3.8 Utility scripts

Perl and Python modules and a companion script, sdQuery.pl,
facilitate interacting with Squepot and performing many
common tasks including the following: parse FASTA files,
generate Aseq IDs, fetch sequences and/or precomputed data,
cross—reference sequences, download visualizations and much
more.

or gene symbols). Furthermore, in addition to the built—in
KEGG pathway set, any custom gene set can be analyzed, by
uploading an archive file containing the pathways (or gene sets)
of interest. Visualization of genes over significant KEGG path—
ways is also possible (Supplementary Data). The user has to be
aware that the statistical signiﬁcance of the Fisher’s Exact Test is
affected by the size and the connectivity of the gene set tested.
Therefore, the results from this test have to be considered as a
rapid and user—friendly way to discover the biological processes
to be further investigated and veriﬁed experimentally.

The impact analysis method (Draghici et al, 2007; Tarca et al,
2009), which allows to determine activation or inhibition of path—
ways depending on the alteration of the genes involved and the
topology of the pathways themselves, is implemented in Pathway
Processor 2.0 using the improved version present in the ‘graphite’
R package (Sales et al, 2012), which provides a fully updated
pathway model for KEGG, Reactome and the Pathway
Interaction Database. Currently, impact analysis is limited to
data from Homo sapiens only.

Gene Ontology analysis is implemented through the R
‘topGO’ package, using a weighted algorithm over the whole
Gene Ontology tree to select the signiﬁcant affected nodes
(Alexa et al, 2006).

In all cases, analysis parameters can be adjusted to ﬁne—tune
the results (Supplementary Data), and all data ﬁles produced can
be downloaded from the web server for further analysis. Multiple
test correction procedures are used to control the rate of false
positives (Supplementary Data).

The third analysis offered by Pathway Processor 2.0 is the
application of the recently developed GSVA, coupled with
linear models for differential expression analysis. This method,
given a set of pathways and normalized gene expression data,
allows the transformation of the data into pathway enrichment
scores (a measure of the state of each pathway), generating a
pathway expression matrix. This matrix is then used for a com—
parison of two user—supplied phenotypes of interest using mod—
erated t—tests as implemented in the R package ‘limma’ (Smyth,
2005). The ﬁnal result is a list of Differentially Regulated
Pathways (DRPs; Supplementary Data) that can then be used
to interpret data with a pathway—based view, providing more
information in elucidating complex phenotypes. The GSVA

matrix can also be downloaded, enabling its use in other down—
stream applications.

All the analyses can be run on the web server after uploading
the required files, without the need for any local installation of
additional software or analysis tools. The software’s perform—
ance is in line with existing solutions (Supplementary Data).

3 CONCLUSIONS

Pathway Processor 2.0 is a useful tool to analyze ‘omics’ datasets,
regardless of the platform that produced them, usable with both
microarays and next—generation sequencing data. The web—based
interface provides a one—stop shop to well—tested bioinformatic
algorithms, and the new methods included in this software enable
interpretation of the data with a true pathway—based view, allow—
ing for deeper insight into complex biological problems.

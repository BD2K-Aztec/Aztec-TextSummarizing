Abstract

Motivation: Random sampling of the solution space has emerged as a popular tool to explore and
infer properties of large metabolic networks. However, conventional sampling approaches com—
monly used do not eliminate thermodynamically unfeasible loops.

Results: In order to overcome this limitation, we developed an efficient sampling algorithm called
loopless Artificially Centered Hit—and—Run on a Box (ll—ACHRB). This algorithm is inspired by the
Hit—and—Run on a Box algorithm for uniform sampling from general regions, but employs the direc—
tions of choice approach of Artificially Centered Hit—and—Run. A novel strategy for generating feas—
ible warmup points improved both sampling efficiency and mixing. ll—ACHRB shows overall better
performance than current strategies to generate feasible flux samples across several models.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that a failure to eliminate unfeasible loops greatly affects sample
statistics, in particular the correlation structure. Finally, we discuss recommendations for the inter—
pretation of sampling results and possible algorithmic improvements.

1 Introduction

 

A diversity of computational methods referred to as constrained-
based methods has been developed to study the characteristics and
capabilities of Genome-scale Models (GEMs). Uniform random
sampling of the flux solution space is a popular choice for interro-
gation of GEMs without introducing optimality criteria. From
evaluation of the impact of physiological constraints on the
sampled flux distributions (Bordbar et (11., 2010; Lewis et (11.,
2010; Mo et (11., 2009; Price et (11., 2004; Shoaie et (11., 2013;
Thomas et (11., 2014; Wiback et (11., 2004) to identification of tran-
scriptional regulation (Bordbar et (11., 2014; Bordel et (11., 2010),
definition of a flux backbone (Almaas et (11., 2004) and correlated
reaction sets (Dal’Molin et (11., 2015; Price et (11., 2004, 2006; Reed

and Palsson, 2004), uniform sampling has been applied to explore
achievable states and emergent properties of networks. More im-
portantly, uniform sampling has emerged as an unbiased tool to as-
sess the capabilities of metabolic reconstructions (Lewis et 111.,
2012i

For this type of analysis to be valid, a key

fluxes v consistent with mass conservation is defined by the follow—
ing set of constraints (Eqs. 1 and 2),

S-v:0 (1)

lbgvgub (2)

The resulting flux space (2 defines a convex polytope describing
the achievable states of the network. Sampling from this multi—di—
mensional body can be efficiently achieved using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods such as the ‘Hit—and—Run’ (HR)
(Smith, 1984) and the ‘Artificially Centered Hit—and—Run’ (ACHR)
(Kaufman and Smith, 1998) algorithms. The latter method has been
particularly preferred for sampling the irregularly shaped solution
space of metabolic networks, as it explores elongated directions of
Q enabling in principle faster mixing. There are, however, add—
itional constraints on v that ensure its thermodynamic feasibility.
Let us denote N m the matrix storing the null space vectors of the in—
ternal reactions described by Sim, and Allth the vector of chemical
potentials for these reactions. According to the first and second law
of thermodynamics, v is thermodynamically feasible if for vim g v

Equations (3) and (4) guarantee respectively that the global po—
tential energy of the network is balanced (first law), and that reac—
tions proceed in the opposite direction of chemical potential change
(second law). These two equations can be satisfied simultaneously
only if the net flux around all closed loops is equal to zero, and
hence it is commonly referred as the ‘loopless condition”. Imposition
of this condition generally causes the solution space Qloopless to be
non—convex, which is much harder to sample and so far no algo—
rithm has been developed to do so. Instead, ad-hoc methods using
conventional samplers have been used to sample from Q and then ei—
ther remove samples with ‘loopy’ patterns (Price et al., 2006), or
find the nearest feasible flux distribution (Schellenberger et al.,
2011). Both approaches have disadvantages. The first approach may
yield few feasible samples making it inefficient in high—dimensional
models, whereas the second approach is impractical in large models
as it requires the solution of a non—polynomial time MILP problem
for each flux distribution.

Here we present a scalable, direct sampling algorithm called
loopless Artificially Centered Hit—and—Run on a Box (ll—ACHRB).
This algorithm is motivated by a recent variation of the Hit—and—
Run algorithm for uniform sampling from general regions (convex
and non—convex) termed ‘Hit—and—Run on a Box” (HRB)
(Kiatsupaibul et al., 2011), and employs directions of choice as in
ACHR. The algorithm shows overall better performance than cur—
rent strategies to generate thermodynamically feasible flux samples
in several metabolic models ranging from small—size models to
GEMs. Finally, we report significant discrepancies in feasible and
unfeasible sample statistics, highlighting the consequences of em—
ploying thermodynamically unfeasible samples for statistical
inference.

2 Algorithm

Our aim is to sample from the thermodynamically feasible solution
space defined by Eqs. (1—4). To this end, we have developed a gen—
eral Hit—and—Run algorithm capable of sampling from this

commonly non—convex space by enclosing Qloopless in a hyper—rect—
angle from which step sizes can be readily chosen following HRB.
Execution of subsequent moves is achieved by randomly choosing
directions using warmup points as in ACHR. As opposed to conven—
tional warmup methods, our strategy pulls warmup points from the
interior of Qloopless, improving both mixing and acceptance rates
(see Results). Importantly, the proposed algorithm enables sampling
of exactly N feasible flux samples as opposed to the strategies re—
ported to date.

Application of the three—step sampling workflow is illustrated
with a toy model initially comprised of 6 internal reactions, three ex—
change reactions and five metabolites (Fig. 1). Initially, the pre—pro—
cessing step takes place using loopless—Flux Variability Analysis (11—
FVA) (Schellenberger et al., 2011) to remove blocked reactions from
the model (1J6), as well as fix reaction directionalities imposed by the
loopless condition (U1, U3 and U4) (Fig. 1A). The resulting model has
1’: 8 reactions, whereof two are reversible (U2 and U5). Execution of
ll—FVA also defines the minimum enclosing box on Qloopless required
for step size selection (see below). After pre—processing, a warmup
phase is used to generate feasible points spanning Qloopless (Fig. 13).
As noted in Megchelenbrink et al. (2014), it is important that these
points lie in the interior of the target space, otherwise the allowed
step sizes can become very small hereby hampering convergence. In
order to generate these points, we cap the lower and upper bounds
of each reaction one—at—a—time to a fraction or < 1 (e.g. or : 0.95) of
the maximum flux range, and next the flux through the reaction
with modified bounds is minimized and maximized subject to
thermodynamic feasibility. In this way, this step yields 21’ feasible in—
terior solutions spanning the desired space.

Once warmup points have been generated, the sampling phase is
initiated following the HRB sampling scheme (Fig. 1C). Let us de—
note vk an arbitrary flux vector in Qloopless E R", vcenter a flux vector
describing the ‘centroid’ of Qloopless, u a direction on the surface of
the n—dimensional unit hypersphere (9D : {u E R”)|)u|) : 1} and
@(vcemer, vwarmup) the direction probability distribution on (9D as
defined in ACHR for accelerated convergence (Kaufman and Smith,
1998). Without loss of generality, let us also assume that Qloopless is
contained in a known n—dimensional box B and that a set of feasible
points vwarmup are known. The ll—ACHRB proceeds as follows.
Starting from vk, a random direction u is drawn from 0 and the
line [k : {/l E Rlv;z + Auk E B} is constructed. Next, the maximum
steps sizes in the negative (Aim?) and positive Mm“) directions
are found by intersecting [k with Qloopless (i.e. longest cord in B),
and a random step size 2% is generated by uniformly sampling from
that interval. The new sample candidate is defined as
ka : vk + lkuk. If Vk+1 e Qloopless, the enclosing box B is
‘shrinked’ by redefining (lﬁmx_,/lﬁmx+) according to the sign of 2,5
(Neal, 2003), and another 2k is uniformly sampled until
vkil E Qloopless. Once a feasible sample is found, the centroid is
updated according to the ACHR update scheme and the entire pro—
cess is reiterated until N uniform samples have been collected. The
details of the algorithm are summarized in Algorithm 1.

The HRB algorithm repeatedly samples step sizes from the inter—
section of [k and Qloopless until a feasible flux distribution is found.
This rejection step is the main modification to the traditional HR
scheme, where a uniform feasible sample on Q can be readily ob—
tained (Smith, 1984). Importantly, as shown by Kiatsupaibul et al.
(2011) the resulting chain {Uklk 2 0} from HRB is also uniform on
the target space.

The computational efficiency of the algorithm depends on the
recurring two main queries: (i) find the length of the longest cord in
B in the direction of [k (line 14) and (ii) check the feasibility of

and the loop laws containing this reaction always hold, i.e. zero re—
actions are loop breakers. Hence, the problem of determining the
feasibility of a flux distribution can be formulated as a search for

any laws in which the terms of HT 'Aﬂim are all positive or negative

int.i
(Nigam and Liang, 2007). This search only requires the signs, not
the actual values, of Allth and the former are readily derived from
vim using Eq. (4). Importantly, given the directionalities of the net—
T

work many loop laws always hold, i.e. n~

int.i'A"iut can be zero, and

the search can be narrowed to only those potentially unfeasible.
Compared to solving Eq. (6), this strategy yielded substantial speed
increases up to two orders of magnitude (Supplementary Fig. 51).

3.2 Initial centroid estimation

Estimation of the centroid vcenter in ACHR is typically achieved by
taking the mean of vwarmup. However, given the non—convexity of
Qloopless, vcenter might not be contained in the feasible space. In order
to ensure the feasibility of the initial vcemer, we compute the nearest

3.3 Effective sample size and mixing

Given a stationary discrete Markov Chain {1%) k 2 0}, we would like
to estimate the time after which the points can be considered uncor—
related. The autocorrelation time describes the mixing of the chain
and can be employed for this purpose (Givens and Hoeting, 2012),

where ﬁk(0) denotes the autocorrelation of lag k for parameter 0
and ‘E is the (integrated) autocorrelation time. A closely related
measure of mixing is the Effective Sample Size (ESS) (Kass et al.,
1998).

E55 : E (9)
‘E

where N is the total sample size. Low effective sample size, i.e. high
autocorrelation time, is indicative of poor mixing of the chain. A
common procedure to compute the sum in Eq. (8) and determine
ESS is to find a cut—off point beyond which the autocorrelation is
very close to zero, and then sum m up to that point. Common
choices for the cut—off point k are such that m < 0.01 or m < 25k,
where 5k is the estimated standard deviation of ‘5 up to k (Givens and
Hoeting, 2012). We have used the former criterion to estimate m.

3.4 Computational implementation

The algorithm was implemented in MATLAB 2013a (The
MathWorks, Natick, MA) using the Gurobi Optimizer 5.6 (Gurobi
Optimization, Inc., Houston, Texas). Simulations were run on a 16—
CPU 64—GB ram Virtual Machine running CentOS Linux 6.5. The
VM is hosted on the QRIScloud Polaris cell. Accelerated sampling
convergence was achieved by exploiting the parallelizable structure
of the algorithm and executing it in multiple cores employing the
Parallel Computing Toolbox of MATLAB.

4 Results

4.1 II—ACHRB performs and scales better than
alternative approaches

The computational performance of the proposed algorithm was
evaluated in different models covering a wide spectrum of metabolic
capabilities. The considered models include the toy model shown in
Figure 1A, an E.coli core model (Orth et al., 2011), the Red Blood
Cell GEM iRBC283 (Bordbar et 4]., 2011), the H.pylori GEM
iIT341 (Thiele et al., 2005), the Tmaritz‘ma GEM iLJ478 (Zhang
et al., 2009), the Gmetallireducens GEM iAF987 (Feist et al.,
2014), and the latest E.coli GEM iJO1366 (Orth et al., 2011). The
features of each model after pre—processing are shown in Table 1.
We have assumed growth in minimal media and no particular biolo—
gical objective for the models. In the case of iIT341, iLJ478, iAF987
and iJO1366, we stripped the biomass equation of trace elements
and in the case of iJO1366, we further compacted the model by
lumping linear pathways into single reactions (see Supplementary
Tables 51—54 for omitted elements). The resulting models preserved

the same fundamental metabolic capabilities of the original with the
difference that they are now numerically tractable for MILP
optimization.

In order to assess the behaviour of ll—ACHRB, its sampling per—
formance was compared against ACHR—the most used sampler in
the literature. The testing procedure was as follows. For each model
and algorithm, three independent Hit—and—Run dynamics were run
until 105 samples were collected. Only one point every 100 steps
(thinning) was collected to reduce serial correlation and the first 104
samples were discarded to reduce bias (burn—in). Also, in order to
ensure a fair comparison, each algorithm was started from an initial
feasible point and centroid.

Table 2 shows the performance of each sampler in each case.
Inspection of the effective sampling time shows that ll—ACHRB is
both more effective and efficient than ACHR, displaying a robust
and efficient performance across all models. In contrast, the effi—
ciency of ACHR for generating feasible samples depends strongly on
the model characteristics. In fact, the results suggest that the overall
sampling performance depends less on the size of the network than
on its topological complexity, i.e. number of potentially unfeasible
loop laws (Table 1). The smallest model had a single potentially un—
feasible loop and this reduced the feasible sample fraction using
ACHR to around 0.5. The RBC GEM was much larger than the toy
model but had no potential unfeasible loops, and hence generated
only feasible samples with both samplers. In contrast, no feasible
samples were found employing ACHR in the E.coli core, iIT341,
iLJ478, iAF987 and JO1366 models. Unlike ACHR, ll—ACHRB was
capable of generating feasible samples for all models in reasonable

time (see effective sampling time, Table 2). These results highlight
that application of ex post screening of feasible samples may not
only be inefficient, but could be impossible for more complex mod—
els, i.e. fail to generate any feasible samples.

We also evaluated the performance of our warmup strategy. To
this task, the ll—ACHRB sampling scheme was employed but now
using warm—up points generated using the conventional approach of
minimizing and maximizing each reaction flux (Schellenberger
et al., 2011). Although the conventional approach was much faster
in generating the required warmup points—particularly in the larger
models—the sampling algorithm was incapable of effectively gener—
ating feasible samples from iAF987 and iJO1366 using these points
(rejection rates ~1.0, Supplementary Table 55). Furthermore, the 11—
ACHRB algorithm using the proposed warmup strategy displayed
lower rejection rates and typically reduced effective sampling times
compared to the case when the conventional warmup strategy was
employed. The above results support the suitability of ll—ACHRB for
the generation of feasible flux samples. Next, we considered the
quality of the samples, i.e. the mixing behaviour of ll—ACHRB.

4.2 ll—ACHRB displays good mixing behaviour

Efficient mixing is particularly difficult to achieve in large metabolic
models encompassing highly heterogeneous scales (De Martino
et al., 2015). In order to assess the mixing properties of ll—ACHRB,
we compared the ESS distribution of each sampler in every model
(Fig. 2). ESS represents the effective number of independent samples
generated from the Markov Chain, and thus is of great importance
for statistical inference. The mixing behaviour was identical for the
E.coli core and iRBC283 models. ll—ACHRB mixed substantially
slower for iLJ478 and iJOl366, displaying an ESS median reduction
of 8.5—fold and 2—fold respectively compared to ACHR (P: 10 T49
and P: 10 T 22 respectively, Wilcoxon rank sum test). In contrast,
ll—ACHRB showed slightly better mixing performance in the toy
model (0.2% ESS median increase, P: 210 T 3 Wilcoxon rank sum
test), and important mixing improvements in both iIT341 and
iAF987 (14.6% and 48.8% ESS median increase respectively,
P : 510 T 3 and P : 610 T 5 Wilcoxon rank sum test). Altogether,
ll—ACHRB displays similar mixing properties as ACHR, but with the
guarantee of thermodynamic feasibility of the samples. Ultimately,
the features of each model will determine the ll—ACHRB mixing
quality.

Particular subspaces may be difficult to reach in a complicated
space. For example, a reaction with a non—zero flux range may never
appear with non—zero flux in the sample, and thus we may lose es—
sential qualitative information (Reimers, 2015 ). We evaluated the

the two blocked reactions from iIT341 (reversible O—succinylhomo—
serine lyase—SHSL4r—and L—threonine deaminase—THRD_L)
(Supplementary Fig. 52 Panel B). Samples from ll—ACHRB show
these two perfectly coupled reactions to be blocked. By constraining
these two reactions to zero, the unfeasible loop is avoided. Notably,
Price et al. (2006) have also studied this loop and have proposed to
manually fix the directionalities of another two perfectly coupled re—
actions involved in it, namely, phosphotransacetylase (PTAr) and
acetate kinese (ACKr). This measure unblocks THRD_L and
SHSL4r and allows all reactions to carry flux avoiding the loop,
however it massively constrains the flux range of PTAr and ACKr
from 65.926 to 0.0169 mmol/gdcw/h. In this particular case, more
experimental evidence is needed to decide between the alternatives.
More importantly, these cases underscore the need for careful ana—
lysis of sampling results from ll—ACHRB.

We finish by mentioning possible improvements to the algo—
rithm. De Martino et al. (2015) have recently reported efficient pro—
cedures for improving the performance of HR by finding an
ellipsoid that closely matches the sampling space. By extracting dir—
ections from the surface of the matching ellipsoid, the performance
of the traditional HR can be greatly improved. This strategy is con—
venient as HR guarantees convergence to the uniform distribution
on the target space (Lovasz, 1999) as opposed to the non—
Markovian ACHR directions choice. A combination of this strategy
with the present algorithm would confer this desired guarantee;
however, it is unclear how well it would scale in the case of a non—
convex space. This will be subject for future research.

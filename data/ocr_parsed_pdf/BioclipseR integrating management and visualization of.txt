ABSTRACT

Summary: Bioclipse, a graphical workbench for the life sciences, pro-
vides functionality for managing and visualizing life science data. We
introduce Bioclipse-R, which integrates Bioclipse and the statistical
programming language R. The synergy between Bioclipse and R is
demonstrated by the construction of a decision support system for
anticancer drug screening and mutagenicity prediction, which shows
how Bioclipse-R can be used to perform complex tasks from within a
single software system.

Availability and implementation: Bioclipse-R is implemented as a set
of Java plug-ins for Bioclipse based on the R-package rj. Source code
and binary packages are available from https://github.com/bioclipse
and http://www.bioclipse.net/bioclipse-r, respectively.

1 INTRODUCTION

Bioclipse (Spjuth et al., 2007, 2009) and R (R Development
Core Team, 2011) are free and open source software systems
for the life sciences and for statistics, respectively. Although
Bioclipse has excellent functionality for managing, editing and
Visualizing chemical and biological information, it lacks data
analytical capabilities. R, on the other hand, is outstanding for
statistics and data analysis, but does not provide functionality for
interactively reading, editing and Visualizing chemical structures
or protein sequences. In this applications note, we describe
and demonstrate Bioclipse-R, a set of Bioclipse plug-ins that
link Bioclipse to R and provide access to R methods from
within Bioclipse.

The Bioconductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004) has
equipped R with tailor made functionality for biology.
However, Bioconductor is primarily targeted at genomics and
has no functionality for chemistry. The R package rcdk adds
core cheminformatics functionality to R but is not focused on
providing a rich graphical user experience with functionality for

editing and Visualizing chemical data in 2D and 3D. Other tools
for integrating R in graphical user interfaces with applications in
biology and chemistry include the workﬂow tools Konstanz
Information Miner (KNIME) (Warr, 2012) and Taverna (Oinn
et al., 2004). These provide nodes in a workﬂow that are capable
of containing R code, but they are focused on constructing re-
producible workﬂows and do not expose R in a workbench en-
vironment where it can be used programmatically and in
combination with other tools in a more investigative fashion.
In contrast to these tools, Bioclipse-R integrates R with the
rich client Bioclipse and, thus, provides cross-fertilization be-
tween R and all other functionality in Bioclipse, for example,
advanced Visualizations, help systems and semantic data man-
agement (Willighagen et al., 2011).

We demonstrate the synergy between Bioclipse and R by con-
structing a decision support system for Virtual screening and
mutagenicity testing of new cancer drugs. Constructing this
system without the integration between Bioclipse and R would
require extensive efforts of copying data between various soft-
ware tools and ﬁle formats, but is almost trivial with Bioclipse-R.
Here, we outline the basic steps of the demonstration and refer
to http://bioclipse.net/bioclipse-r for a detailed step-by-step
description. The operations can be performed both in the
Bioclipse Scripting Language (ESL) and in Bioclipse’ graphical
user interface.

2 DEMONSTRATION

This section describes the workﬂow for constructing the decision
support system for Virtual screening and mutagenicity testing
of new cancer drugs. It consists of three parts: (i) construction
of a quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) model
for anticancer activity; (ii) construction of a QSAR model
for mutagenicity; and (iii) using the models constructed in (i)
and (ii) to perform a Virtual screen of the DrugBank approved
drugs database for non-mutagenic compounds with anticancer
activity.

2.1 Cancer cell line growth inhibition modelling

The NCI60 is a panel of 59 cancer cell lines developed by the
National Cancer Institute (NCI), which is used for screening of
new anticancer drug candidates (see, e.g. Shoemaker, 2006).
Using a set of 3515 chemical compounds screened against the

glioblastoma cell line U251, we built a QSAR model to predict
whether a new compound has anticancer activity according to
the following workﬂow:

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

Import and inspect molecules. The chemical structures were
downloaded as a Simpliﬁed Molecular-Input Line-Entry
System (SMILES)—formatted file and imported into a
new project in Bioclipse. Bioclipse uses the Chemistry
Development Kit (CDK) (Steinbeck et al., 2003) as the
cheminformatics library for input, output and internal
representation of chemical structures, as well as for struc-
ture diagram generation and rendering. The Bioclipse
Molecules Table (Figs 1a and 2) and the chemical structure
editor JChemPaint (Krause et al., 2000) were used to in-
spect the chemical structures.

Generate 3D coordinates. We used the Balloon (V ainio and
Johnson, 2007) Bioclipse plug-in to generate 3D coordin-
ates for the molecules so we could View the molecules in
the integrated 3D Viewer Jmol (Hanson, 2010) and com-
pute descriptors that require 3D coordinates.

Compute descriptors for the molecules. Constitutional,
electronic, atomic, molecular and topological descriptors
were computed with the Bioclipse-QSAR plug-in (Spjuth
et al., 2010), which can be used both form a graphical
user interface and through a scripting interface (Fig. 1).
The descriptors were calculated for compounds in their
neutral state.

Build and validate QSAR model. Using R from within
Bioclipse, we split the U251 dataset into a training set
containing 2515 molecules and a test set containing 1000
molecules (the split was done by random selection). Using
the training data, we built a random forest model to dis-
criminate between compounds with and without antican-
cer activity [the R-package ‘randomForest’ (Liaw and
Wiener, 2002) with the default parameter settings was

used]. We then used the model to predict the activity of
the compounds in the test set, resulting in an area under
the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of
77.8% (95% conﬁdence interval: 74.9780.7%), indicating
relatively good predictive performance [the R-package
‘pROC’ (Robin et al., 2011) was used for computing the
AUC]. For details and R-code, see http://pele.farmbio.uu.
se/bcr/bcr-screening.html.

2.2 Mutagenicity modelling

As it is not uncommon for anticancer drugs to be mutagenic, we
wanted to be able to test compounds predicted to have antic-
ancer activity for mutagenicity. We, therefore, constructed a
QSAR model predicting mutagenicity based on a set of 6504
compounds tested with the Ames assay (Hansen et al., 2009).
This was done as follows:

(1) Import and inspect molecules. (Analogous to l).

(2) Compute signature descriptors and set-up dataset. Signature
descriptors (Faulon et al., 2003) are of a different nature
than molecular descriptors calculated with Bioclipse-
QSAR in 3. The signature descriptors are provided by
the Bioclipse-Decision Support (DS) plug-in (Spjuth
et al., 2011), instead, and because they do not require
3D coordinates, the analogue of 2 is skipped.

(3) Build and validate QSAR model. We used R within
Bioclipse to split the Ames dataset into a training set
and a test set, containing 5504 and 1000 molecules,
respectively (by random selection). We then used the
R-package ‘e1071’ (Dimitriadou et al., 2010) to ﬁt a sup-
port vector machine with a Gaussian kernel to the training
set to discriminate mutagenic from non-mutagenic
compounds. The parameters y and C in the Gaussian
kernel function were optimized using a grid search,

cross-validated classiﬁcation error was used as objective
function in the grid search. Using the support vector ma-
chine model optimized on the training data to predict the
mutagenicity in the test set, we achieved an AUC of
87.85% (95% conﬁdence interval 85.72789.98%), indicat-
ing good predictive performance. For details and R-code,
see http://pele.farmbio.uu.se/bcr/bcr-mutagenicity.html.

2.3 Virtual screening and mutagenicy prediction

Using the two QSAR models for growth inhibition and muta-
genicity prediction constructed in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, we
screened the subset of DrugBank (Knox et al., 2011) with
approved drugs:

(1)

(2)

Screen approved compounds from DrugBank. Using the
ESL and the Bioclipse-DS, JChemPaint and Jmol
Bioclipse plug-ins, we iterated over the molecules in the
DrugBank approved dataset, generated 3D coordinates
for the compounds, computed descriptors, and predicted
each molecule’s anticancer activity (using the QSAR
model constructed in Section 2.1) and mutagenicity
(using the QSAR model constructed in Section 2.2).
Using a BSL script, we generated a table sorted on
growth inhibition (Fig. 2).

Display screening hit in 2D and 3D. We inspected the top
screening hits in 2D using the Bioclipse Molecules Table,
which also permits easy access to DrugBank information
for these compounds using hyperlinks embedded in the
table that open in the internal browser in Bioclipse.
Using the Balloon conformer generation, we could

generate 3D coordinates and inspect the screening hits in
3D using the Jmol component in Bioclipse. The focus of
this article is the integration of Bioclipse and R, and not
the results of the screening per se. However, we may note
that three of the top five hits from the screening model are
drugs used in cancer treatment (plicamycin, oxaliplatin
and daunorubicin, see Figure 2 and http://pele.farmbio.
uu.se/bcr/bcr-vscreen.html), tentatively indicating that the
growth inhibition screening model does a decent job in
ranking molecules.

(3) Interpret predictions. To interpret the results, we re-ran the
predictions in Bioclipse Decision Support. When using the
growth inhibition and mutagenicity models in Bioclipse
Decision Support, the substructure that contributed the
most to the prediction of a given compound’s bioactivity
is highlighted. The highlighted substructure is, thus, the
site where structural modiﬁcation would affect the pre-
dicted bioactivity the most (Fig. 3a). This interpretation
of non-linear models is based on the method by Carlsson
et al. (2009) and allows for guidance when exploring dif-
ferent hypotheses of how structural changes of molecules
would affect their predictions (a screencast demonstrating
this functionality in further detail is available at http://pele.
farmbio.uu.se/bcr/bcr-vscreenhtml).

3 IMPLEMENTATION AND AVAILABILITY

A set of plug-ins for Bioclipse were implemented in Java, adding
a bridge to R. The plug-ins build on the StatET project (http://
www.walware.de/goto/statet), which in turn uses the R-package
rj (W ahlbrink and Verbeke, 2011) (see Fig. 3b). Bioclipse

makes R available both via the user interface as well as the BSL

maintains a persistent connection with R, and allows for execut-
ing commands and scripts and retrieving result back into
Bioclipse, with functionality exposed both in the graphical user
interface as well as from BSL.

Bioclipse-R is available for the operating systems Windows,
Linux and Mac OS X. Source code and binary packages are
available under the Eclipse Public License (http://www.eclipse.
org/org/documents/epl-Vl0.php) from https://github.com/bio-
clipse and http://www.bioclipse.net/bioclipse-r, respectively.

4 CONCLUﬁON

We show how we can conduct advanced tasks from within a single
software platform by leveraging the functionality in Bioclipse and
R. The demonstration shows the cross-fertilization between R
and numerous Bioclipse components (CDK, Balloon, Bioclipse-
QSAR, Bioclipse-DS, J ChemPaint and Jmol). It also shows how
Bioclipse-R allows for easy access to statistical models fitted in R
from a graphical user interface as well as from BSL scripts, thus
allowing for automation and exchange of complete Bioclipse-R
workﬂows. Bioclipse-R also enriches the bioinformatics function-
ality in Bioclipse through access to Bioconductor Via R. The plug-
in-based architecture of Bioclipse makes extensions simple, and
future development of Bioclipse-R will include a user-friendly
graphical interface for performing statistical analyses.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Fuzzy c-means clustering is widely used to identify
cluster structures in high-dimensional datasets, such as those
obtained in DNA microarray and quantitative proteomics experi-
ments. One of its main limitations is the lack of a computationally
fast method to set optimal values of algorithm parameters. Wrong
parameter values may either lead to the inclusion of purely random
fluctuations in the results or ignore potentially important data. The
optimal solution has parameter values for which the clustering
does not yield any results for a purely random dataset but which
detects cluster formation with maximum resolution on the edge of
randomness.

Results: Estimation of the optimal parameter values is achieved
by evaluation of the results of the clustering procedure applied to
randomized datasets. In this case, the optimal value of the fuzzifier
follows common rules that depend only on the main properties of the
dataset. Taking the dimension of the set and the number of objects
as input values instead of evaluating the entire dataset allows us to
propose a functional relationship determining the fuzzifier directly.
This result speaks strongly against using a predefined fuzzifier
as typically done in many previous studies. Validation indices are
generally used for the estimation of the optimal number of clusters.
A comparison shows that the minimum distance between the
centroids provides results that are at least equivalent or better than
those obtained by other computationally more expensive indices.

1 INTRODUCTION

New experimental techniques and protocols allow experiments
with high resolution and thus lead to the production of large
amounts of data. In turn, these datasets demand effective machine-
learning techniques for extraction of information. Among them, the
recognition of patterns in noisy data still remains a challenge. The
aim is to merge the outstanding ability of the human brain to detect
patterns in extremely noisy data with the power of computer-based
automation. Cluster analysis allows to group high-dimensional data

points that exhibit similar properties and so to discover a possible
functional relationship within subsets of data.

Nowadays, cluster analysis is in widespread use for the analysis
of microarray data to discover genes with similar expression
changes. Recently, large datasets from quantitative proteomics, for
instance measuring the peptide/protein expression by means of mass
spectrometry, became available. For this data, cluster analysis is
a powerful tool to identify or to conﬁrm pathways of interacting
proteins.

Different approaches to the problem of cluster analysis exist,
such as hierarchical clustering (Eisen et (11., 1998), k-means
clustering (Tavazoie et (11., 1999) and self-organizing maps (Tamayo
et (11., 1999). Noise or background signals in collected data
normally come from different sources, such as intrinsic noise from
variation within the sample and noise coming from the experimental
equipment. An appropriate method to ﬁnd clusters in this kind of
data is based on fuzzy c-means clustering (Bezdek, 1981; Dunn,
1973) due to its robustness to noise (Hanai et (11., 2006). Although
this method has been modiﬁed and extended many times [for an
overview see Doring et al. (2006)], the original procedure (Bezdek,
1981) remains the most commonly used to date.

In contrast to k-means clustering, the fuzzy c-means procedure
involves an additional parameter, generally called the ﬁlzziﬁer.
A data point (e.g. a gene or protein, from now on called an object)
is not directly assigned to a cluster but is allowed to obtain fuzzy
memberships to all clusters. This makes it possible to decrease
the effect of data objects that do not belong to one particular
cluster, for example objects located between overlapping clusters or
objects resulting from background noise. These objects, by having
rather distributed membership values, now have a low inﬂuence
in the calculation of the cluster center positions. Hence, with the
introduction of this new parameter, the cluster analysis becomes
much more efﬁcient in dealing with noisy data. The value of the
fuzziﬁer deﬁnes the maximum ﬁlzziness or noise in the dataset.
Whereas the k-means clustering procedure always ﬁnds clusters
independently on the extent of noise in the data, the fuzzy method
allows ﬁrst to adapt the method to the present amount of noise
and second to avoid erroneous detection of clusters generated by
random patterns. Therefore, the challenge consists in determining
an appropriate value of the ﬁlzziﬁer.

To our knowledge, only few methods exist to determine an optimal
value of the fuzziﬁer. In Dembele and Kastner (2003), the fuzziﬁer
is obtained with an empirical method calculating the coefﬁcient
of variation of a function of the distances between all objects
of the entire dataset. Another approach searches for a minimal

ﬁlzziﬁer value for which the cluster analysis of the randomized
dataset produces no meaningful results, by comparing a modiﬁed
partition coefﬁcient for different values of both parameters (Futschik
and Carlisle, 2005). The calculations in these two methods imply
operations on the entire dataset and become computationally
expensive for large datasets.

Here, we introduce a method to determine the value of the ﬁlzziﬁer
without using the current dataset. Our study also shows that the
optimal ﬁlzziﬁer generally takes values far from the frequently used
value 2. The present method can be applied to any dataset for which
one wants to detect clusters of non-random origin. Its advantages
are to provide an optimal parameter set and to save computational
time when processing large datasets.

In the following section, the algorithm of ﬁlzzy c-means clustering
is introduced and the concept to avoid random cluster detections
is explained. We present a simpliﬁed model showing a strong
dependence of the fuzziness on the main properties of the dataset and
conﬁrm this result by evaluating randomized artiﬁcial datasets. We
distinguish between valid and invalid cluster analysis by looking at
the minimal distances between the found centroids. This relationship
is quantiﬁed by ﬁtting a mathematical function to the results for
the minimum centroid distance. Finally, we determine the second
parameter of the cluster analysis, the number of clusters. Different
validation indices are compared for artiﬁcial and real datasets.

2 DATASET AND ALGORITHM

Clustering algorithms are often used to analyze a large number of
objects, for example genes in microarray data, each containing a
number of values obtained at different experimental conditions. In
other terms, the dataset consists of N object vectors of D dimensions
(experimental conditions), and thus an optimal framework contains
N X D experimental values. The aim is to group these objects into
clusters with similar behaviors.

In gene expression data and in quantitative proteomics data,
the values of each object represent only a relative quantity to be
compared with the other values of the object. Therefore, the focus
is on fold changes and not on absolute value changes (a 2-fold,
i.e. 200%, increase has the same weight as a 2-fold decrease, 50%).
In this case, the values are transformed by taking their logarithm
before the data are to be evaluated.

In fuzzy c-means clustering (Bezdek, 1981), the data are prepared
by normalization of each object to have values with mean 0 and
SD 1. Then, for a given parameter set c, m — the number of clusters
and the ﬁlzziﬁer — the clustering corresponds to minimizing the
objective function,

A large ﬁlzziﬁer value suppresses outliers in datasets, i.e. the
larger m, the more clusters share their objects and vice versa. At the
limit m—> 1, the method becomes equivalent to k-means clustering,
whereas for m—> 00 all data objects have identical membership to
each cluster.

Usually, the value of the fuzziﬁer is set equal to 2 (Babuska, 1998;
Hoppner et al., 1999; Pal and Bezdek, 1995). This may be considered
a compromise between an a priori assumption of a certain amount
of fuzziness in the dataset and the advantage of avoiding a time
consuming calculation of its value. However, by carefully adjusting
the fuzziﬁer, it should be possible to optimize the algorithm to take
into account the characteristic noise present in the dataset. We are
interested in having maximal sensitivity to observe barely detectable
cluster structures combined with a low probability of assigning
clusters originating from random ﬂuctuations.

We minimize the objective ﬁlnction J (c,m) by carrying out 100
iterations of Equations (3 and 4). The application of Equations (3—4)
converges to a solution that might be trapped in a local minimum,
requiring the user to repeat the minimization procedure several times
with different initial conditions. In order to be able to carry out a vast
parameter study, we limited the evaluation to 5—10 performances per
dataset and parameter set, taking the performance corresponding to
the best clustering result, i.e. the one with the smallest ﬁnal value
of the objective function.

The ﬁnal classiﬁcation of a dataset into different clusters in ﬁlzzy
clustering is not as clear as in the case of k-means clustering where
each object is assigned to exactly one cluster. In ﬁlzzy c-means
clustering, each object belongs to each cluster, to the degree given
by the membership value. The centroid, i.e. the center of a cluster,
corresponds therefore to the center of all objects of the dataset, each
contributing with its own membership value. As a consequence, we
need to deﬁne a threshold that deﬁnes whether an object belongs to
a certain cluster. Ideally, this threshold is set to 1/2. Hence, due to
the limitation of Equation (2), each object belongs to maximally one
cluster.

A cluster with at least one object having a membership value
greater than 1/2 is called a non-empty cluster. The number of non-
empty clusters Cﬁnal found in the cluster analysis can be smaller
than the number of previously deﬁned clusters, c. Therefore, we
can deﬁne the case Cﬁnal <c to be a case of no solution for the
application of the cluster analysis. In other words, a cluster analysis
leading to at least one empty cluster will not be considered as a valid
performance.

By distinguishing cases for which the cluster analysis gives a
valid result and cases of invalid results, it is possible to identify
parameter regions where the algorithm identiﬁes clusters that may

result from random ﬂuctuations. As example, take a dataset and its
randomized counterpart. We now ﬁx c and compare the results of the
clustering for increasing ﬁlzziﬁer values, m. At m—> 1, the cluster
analysis is equivalent to k-means clustering, assigning exactly one
cluster to each object and the no-solution case does not exist. The
clustering of both the original and the randomized dataset will
give c valid clusters. By increasing the value of the fuzziﬁer, the
membership values of outliers become more distributed between the
clusters whereas objects pertaining to real clusters get their largest
membership value decreased only slightly. Each cluster looses object
members with membership values larger than 1/2 and the total
number of objects that are assigned to a cluster as hard members
decreases. As the objects of a randomized dataset are distributed
almost homogeneously in cluster space, the clustering algorithm
stops to detect a total of c non-empty clusters above a certain
threshold of the fuzziﬁer. When further increasing m, also the objects
in the original dataset will have their largest membership values fall
below 1/2 and so the clustering of the original data will stop to
produce valid results above another threshold of m. The parameter
region between these two thresholds is of particular interest. Within
this region, only the clustering of the original dataset produces valid
results and thus the found clusters can be understood to correspond
to non-random object groupings. Precisely, we prefer to take an as
low as possible value of the fuzziﬁer, combining minimal fuzziness
and maximal cluster recognition. The procedure presented in the
next sections shows how to obtain a minimal value of m that still
does not give a valid solution for the clustering of the randomized
dataset. A dataset having the same threshold for both the clustering
of the original set and the randomized one should be discarded
as it is too noisy. However, we will see that the value of the
ﬁlzziness increases strongly for low-dimensional datasets and thus
a compromise between accepting clusters with members of noisy
origin and low detection of patterns must be found.

3 ARGUMENTS FOR A FUNCTIONAL
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FUZZIFIER
AND THE DATASET STRUCTURE

A strong relationship between the ﬁlzziﬁer and the basic properties
of the dataset can be demonstrated by means of a simpliﬁed model
system. With increasing dimension, clusters are less likely to be
found in a completely random dataset. In order to illustrate this
dependency mathematically, one might reduce the system to a binary
D-dimensional object space, i.e. xide{—1,1}. Let us now look
at a cluster that contains an accumulation of objects at a given
point in object space. For example, for a purely random object, the
probability to have xi=(1,1,..., 1) is given by 2TD. Furthermore,
the probability to have half or more of all objects of the dataset
with this particular value, for 2_D << 1, might be approximated by

2N(1_ g), /2/(]TN) (for details see Supplementary Materials). Hence,
the probability for a well-deﬁned cluster decreases exponentially
with respect to the dimension of the dataset, and slightly slower for
an increasing number of objects in the set. As a consequence, the
clustering parameter value m being a measure for the fuzziness of
the system should follow these tendencies at least qualitatively. This
ﬁnding argues strongly against an application of the fuzzy algorithm
by merely using m :2. We will show that the simpliﬁed model
predicts the dependencies on both quantities in the right way.

Parameters of the clustering Parameters of the artiﬁcial dataset

 

m: fuzziﬁer N: number of objects

D: number of dimensions of an object

M: number of Gaussian-distributed clusters
N0: number of data points per cluster

w: SD of Gaussian

0: number of clusters

 

An extensive evaluation of the clustering procedure is carried
out using artiﬁcially generated datasets as input. Each object
corresponds to a random point generated out of D-dimensional
Gaussian distributions with SD w. The dataset consists of M
Gaussian-distributed clusters with each having N0 objects, leading
to a total ofN =N0 X M objects in the set. Each Gaussian is centered
at a random position in object space, having coordinates between
0 and 10 for each dimension. An optimal cluster analysis should
identify c =M as best solution. The parameters of the ﬁlzzy c-means
algorithm and the parameters of the artiﬁcial dataset are summarized
in Table 1.

A ﬁrst step to ﬁnd an optimal value of the ﬁlzziﬁer consists
in applying the clustering procedure to randomized datasets. We
generate these sets by random permutations of the values of each
object. A threshold for the ﬁlzziﬁer value m is reached as soon as
the clustering procedure does not provide any valid solution for the
randomized set. This corresponds to the case where the number of
non-empty clusters is smaller than the value of the parameter c.
However, another criterion allows a more accurate estimation. We
will refuse a clustering solution having two centroids that coincide,
i.e. their mutual distance falls below some predeﬁned value.

Figure 1 shows both the number of non-empty clusters as well as
the minimum centroid distance for different realizations of artiﬁcial
datasets. There is a sudden decay to zero of both quantities when
increasing the ﬁlzziﬁer. Three important conclusions can be made
from the results depicted in Figure 1: ﬁrst, the position of the
decay of the minimal centroid distances coincides with the one
where the number of non-empty clusters changes from c to c— 1.
Apparently, a cluster without any membership values over the 1/2
limit (an empty cluster) has always its centroid coincide with the
centroid of one of the non-empty clusters. We could not ﬁnd any
mathematical explanation for this behavior, but our analysis shows
that this relation seems to be a general characteristics of the ﬁlzzy
c-means algorithm. Taking a threshold other than 1 / 2 would break
this equivalence. By using the minimum centroid distance as main
criterion, the results now are independent of this threshold. Secondly,
the minimum centroid distance decay occurs at almost exactly the
same value of m over the entire range of c. This seems to be a typical
behavior in randomized datasets. Thirdly, the m-position of the decay
decreases for higher dimensions of the dataset. Datasets of higher
dimension have a structure where random clusters are less likely as
already illustrated with the simpliﬁed model presented above. We
will take the minimum centroid distance to measure the m-value
of the threshold in the following analysis, which is from now on
denoted mt.

Figure 2 compares the minimum centroid distance for differently
distributed datasets, each randomized before applying the cluster
analysis. The picture remains mainly the same, with exception of

the case M = 1, where the threshold mt lies at a slightly higher
value. The reason is that the threshold still varies within some range
for randomized datasets of equal dimension and number of objects.
The magnitude of this variation decreases for datasets of higher
dimension.

Despite the normalization of each object to have SD 1 and
mean 0, a strong bias of the values toward certain dimensions
may occur. This bias leads to different results for the clustering
of the randomized dataset. By processing different datasets with the
same parameters but different positions of the artiﬁcial Gaussian-
distributed objects’ center, we try to capture the effects of both
symmetric as well as biased datasets. The case M :1 in Figure 2
corresponds to the clustering results of strongly biased data. The bias
becomes large the more the center of the Gaussian deviates from
the origin of the coordinate system. For M > 1, this bias becomes
smoothed out by randomization and therefore mt varies much less.
For example, a biased dataset would be gene expression data where
most of the genes are upregulated at one of the experimental stages
(dimensions). A more detailed description of the effect of biased
datasets can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

centroid distances of randomized datasets for different values of in
(horizontal axis) and 0 (vertical axis). Each panel shows these quantities
calculated over the given range of m and c for a randomized dataset. The
picture is nearly identical for different datasets with the same properties. The
object points are Gaussian distributed with SD w: 1, dimensions 5, 8 and
10, and were randomized afterwards. There are 500 objects per dataset. The
threshold of m where the number of non-empty clusters becomes smaller
than c and the minimum centroid distance approaches zero does not vary
signiﬁcantly for different 0. Moreover, the m-position of the threshold is the
same for both measures within the same dimension.

No changes of the minimum centroid distance landscape were
found for datasets with different data ranges or datasets with
a varying amount of cluster members inside the same set (see
Supplementary Materials).

The analysis of the simpliﬁed model showed also a dependency
of the fuzziness in the dataset on the number of objects, N, although
weaker than the one on the dimension of the dataset. Figure 3
conﬁrms this result, showing that mt increases for smaller N and
saturates at a certain level for large N Z 1000.

4 ESTIMATING THE OPTIMAL VALUE OF THE
FUZZIFIER

We now focus on the estimation of the dependency of the threshold
on both N and D, i.e. we neglect the effect of biased datasets.
This threshold will then be taken as the optimal value. A rule of
thumb for the maximum number of clusters in a dataset is that it
does not exceed the square root of the number of objects (Zadeh,
1965). As the threshold of the minimum of centroid distances mt
does not vary with c, we determine the threshold in the following
analysis by carrying out cluster analysis with different m for c = «/N.
Precisely, the threshold mt corresponds to the value of the fuzziﬁer
at which the minimum centroid distance falls <0.1 for the ﬁrst
time. For small dimensions and object numbers and m>mt, the
minimum centroid distance may vary to values slightly larger than 0.
A threshold of 0.1 allows to include even extreme cases like D=4
andN = 50. However, a threshold of 0.01 would already be sufﬁcient
for N 3 100 and D3 5. Note, that we hereby exclude the situation
that the centroids of two clusters locate at mutually small distances
of less than 0.1. However, this limitation did not affect the results.

The clustering is carried out 5—10 times, each analysis for a
different randomized artiﬁcial dataset having the same parameters.
From these different runs we take the largest value of mt.

The usage of m =mt in the cluster analysis of the original dataset
has two advantages. First, a dataset lacking non-random clusters
does not provide any reasonable results, i.e. the number of detected
non-empty clusters is lower than the parameter c. This means that
the value of the minimum centroid distance is around 0 for all c.
Secondly, this smallest allowed value of m guarantees an optimal
estimation of a maximal number of clusters which is in general
better than for larger m and so still ensures the recognition of barely
detectable clusters. The dependency of mt on the dimension of
the dataset is shown in Figure 4a and compared with the values
calculated by the method introduced in Dembele and Kastner (2003).
The curves from the latter method exhibit the same tendency but an
overestimation of the ﬁizziﬁer.

differences can be observed except for the panel with M = 1 where the threshold m, seems to have a slightly larger value.

and N = 200.

Both the data points of mt and their empirical ﬁt with Equation (5)
are depicted in Figure 4b. The prediction with the empirical formula
improves for large N and large D. For smaller values of these input
values, the mt obtained from the artiﬁcial sets may deviate from the
predicted value due to their dependency on the individual dataset.

We calculated the density distribution of mt for artiﬁcial sets with
the same parameters, setting M = 1, D=7 and N =200 (Fig. 5).
The corresponding prediction for mt is given by f(7,200)= 1.75.
The only difference between the datasets consists in the position
of the mean of the Gaussian, and thus the bias of the data. The
maximum of the distribution lies at a slightly smaller value than the
one predicted in Equation (5). The ﬁgure shows also that the lower
limit of mt is rather well deﬁned, whereas high values are possible,
even far away from the maximum. Consequently, for datasets with
small N and D, Equation (5) may be more useful for the estimation
of the lower limit of mt. However, the prediction works much better
for larger values of D and N.

Equation (5) accounts also for randomized real datasets where the
distribution within a cluster may be non-Gaussian. For the analysis,
we tested datasets from different origin including biological data
from protein research (Horton and Nakai, 1996; Olsen et al., 2006;
Pierce et al., 2008; Wolf-Yadlin et al., 2007), microarray data (Cho
et al., 1998; Iyer et al., 1999; Tavazoie et al., 1999) and data gathered
from non-biological experiments (Nash et al., 1994; Sigillito et al.,
1989).

Table 2 compares the minimum centroid threshold calculated
from the randomized datasets to the empirical value obtained from
Equation (5). We ﬁnd a deviation for the iTRAQ3 dataset having
a small D :7 and N =222. From Figure 5, we see that the higher
value of mt = 1.81 is still within the range of the distribution. Note,
that the optimal fuzziﬁer value for the yeast2 dataset was estimated
to be m: 1.15 in Futschik and Carlisle (2005), identical with our
estimation.

5 DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF CLUSTERS

After calculating the optimal value of the ﬁizziﬁer by either using
Equation (5) or determining mt directly as done above, the ﬁnal
step consists in estimating the number of clusters in the dataset.
Various validity indices for the quality of the clustering are present
in the literature. They in general are a ﬁinction of the membership
values, the centroid coordinates and the dataset. The results for the
indices summarized in Table 3 will be compared for artiﬁcial and
real datasets.

First we take another look on the minimum centroid distance,
VMCD, now taken from the cluster analysis of artiﬁcial (not
randomized) datasets (Fig. 6). The panels show VMCD for datasets
with 10 Gaussian-distributed clusters, each panel for a set of
Gaussians with different SDs. For datasets with clearly separated
clusters (small SDs), the picture is completely different to the one
of a randomized dataset (Figs 1—3). A strong decay, this time not
necessarily to zero, occurs at c: ct independent of the value of the
used fuzziﬁer m. Note that in the randomized case the decay was

at mt for all c. The position of the sudden decrease coincides with
the number of clusters M = 10 of the artiﬁcial dataset, and thus the
minimum centroid distance provides a reasonable measure also to
determine the optimal number of clusters. For more mixed clusters,
the landscape transforms gradually into the picture observed for
randomized sets.

The parameter landscapes of real datasets will exhibit a
combination of two extremes, a plateau below the threshold ct for a
dataset with clearly distinguishable cluster and a plateau below mt
for a completely noisy dataset. We can also observe that the number
of found clusters decreases with increasing m (cases w=2, w=3
and w=4 in Fig. 6) as would be expected.

Equation (5) gives mt: 1.47 for the parameters of the artiﬁcial
datasets in Figure 6. The ﬁgure shows that some of the clusters may
be recognized even for w: 3 and w=4, when using m=mt for the

Fig. 7. Comparison of the different validity indices for an artiﬁcial system
of 500 10-dimensional data points, with 10 clusters each with 50 points.
All indices show that c: 10 is an optimal solution given by a maximum,
maximum, minimum, knee, jump, minimum, minimum and a maximum for
the indices beginning from the upper left to the lower right, respectively.

clustering (i.e. we ﬁnd a decay of the minimum centroid distance at
c = 7 for m = 1.47). For larger values of the fuzziﬁer, no clusters can
be detected, whereas the decay begins to become less accentuated
for smaller m-values. Hence, the minimum centroid distances may
be considered as a powerful validity index for the case that the
appropriate m =m; is chosen. Another advantage of using VMCD is
that its calculation is faster than the one of the other validity indices.
Figure 6 proofs how a carefully chosen fuzziﬁer allows optimal
cluster detection. When taking the popular value m: 2, the cluster
analysis ﬁnds a minimum centroid distance equal to zero for the
cases w: 2, w = 3 and w :4 and thus cannot be considered as valid
as there are at least two identical cluster centers.

For a comparison of the different validation indices, we generated
a dataset with D=13, N=500, M: 10 and w=2 for which
Equation (5) gives m; = 1.25. Figure 7 shows the validation indices
versus the cluster number c using m=mt. All methods clearly
indicate c: 10 as the optimal solution. Note, that there is also a
strong decay of VMCD at C: 10.

Real data normally is more complex than the artiﬁcial sets
analyzed here. Not only the kind of noise may be different but
also the clusters may not have normal distributed values and the
clusters might have different sizes. As a consequence, often an
optimal parameter set does not exist, and the most appropriate
solution must be chosen manually out of the best candidates. As
a test dataset we used the serum set (Iyer et al., 1999) that has the
same number of dimensions and a similar number of objects as the
artiﬁcial dataset analyzed in Figure 7. The validation indices now do
not agree in giving a clear indication for the number of clusters in the
system (Fig. 8). However, most of them yield c=5 as the optimal
solution. The abrupt decay of the minimum centroid distance at the
same c=5 is remarkable. Figure 9a depicts the landscape of the
minimum centroid distance for the serum dataset over a large range
of m and c. We observe a similarity between Figure 9a and the case
w = 3 in Figure 6, suggesting that the dataset consists of overlapping
but distinguishable clusters. The minimum centroid distance has a
plateau for c f 5 and m < 2 with a decay at c = 5 over a considerable
range of m-values around m; = 1.25 indicating c :5 as the optimal
choice.

Figure 9b shows the patterns of all clusters for the cluster analysis
on the serum dataset taking c = 5 and m = 1.25. The lines correspond

6 CONCLUSIONS

In ﬁrzzy c-means cluster analysis, it is crucial to choose the
optimal parameters since a large ﬁrzziﬁer value leads to the loss of
information and a low one leads to the inclusion of false observations
originating from random noise. The value of the fuzziﬁer was
frequently set to 2 in many studies without speciﬁcation of the
amount of noise in the system. We show here that the strong
dependence of the optimal ﬁrzziﬁer value on the dimension of the
system requires ﬁne-tuning of this parameter.

To our knowledge, two methods exist to obtain the fuzziﬁer by
processing the dataset (Dembele and Kastner, 2003; Futschik and
Carlisle, 2005). In the former method, a distance matrix between all
objects of the dataset needs to be calculated which makes the method
cumbersome for large datasets as the number of distances increases

with N 2. In Futschik and Carlisle (2005), they compare the values of
a modiﬁed partition coefﬁcient for a large range of the parameters m
and c. As the clustering procedure also slows down considerably for
larger datasets, this second method may require large computation
times.

We present here a new, fast and simple method to estimate the
ﬁizziﬁer being calculated from only two main properties of the
dataset, its dimension and the number of objects. Using this method,
we obtained not only an optimal balance between maximal cluster
detection and maximal suppression of random effects but it also
allows us to process larger datasets. Instead of using computationally
expensive measures applying the clustering algorithm many times,
the fuzziﬁer is simply calculated from Equation (5) and thus there
are no slowdowns for large datasets. The estimated values of the
ﬁizziﬁer are similar in all three methods, although they might be
overestimated in Dembele and Kastner (2003). Our method allows
a larger range of dataset properties, like very high dimensions
(D>40) and very large numbers of objects. The results suggest
that biased data lead to an increase of the value of the ﬁizziﬁer
in low-dimensional datasets with a small number of objects (for
instance, N <200 and D<8) and thus the parameters should be
chosen carefully for this type of data. The estimation is based on
the evaluation of the minimal distance between the centroids of
the clusters found by the cluster analysis. The minimum centroid
distance provides sufﬁcient information for the estimation of
the other parameter necessary for the clustering procedure, the
number of clusters, and eliminates the need for calculation of
computationally intensive validation indices.

In data from proteomic studies, especially labeled mass
spectrometry data, protein expressions are compared over a
generally smaller number of stages (for instance, less or equal to
8 in iTRAQ data). As our study shows, the optimal value of the
ﬁizziﬁer increases strongly at low dimensions to values larger than
m: 2 making it difﬁcult to obtain well-deﬁned clusters. Therefore,
a compromise needs to be made, by allowing lower ﬁizziﬁer values,
m < m;, admitting the inﬂuence of random ﬂuctuations to the results.
A quantiﬁcation of the conﬁdence of the cluster analysis of low-
dimensional data needs to be carried out or other methods of data
comparison, such as direct comparison of the absolute data values,
must complement the data analysis.

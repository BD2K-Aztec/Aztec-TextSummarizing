ABSTRACT

Summary: Although small non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs,
have well-established functions in the cell, long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) have only recently started to emerge as abundant
regulators of cell physiology, and their functions may be diverse. A
small number of studies describe interactions between small and
IncRNAs, with IncRNAs acting either as inhibitory decoys or as
regulatory targets of microRNAs, but such interactions are still poorly
explored. To facilitate the study of microRNA—lncRNA interactions,
we implemented miRcode: a comprehensive searchable map of
putative microRNA target sites across the complete GENCODE
annotated transcriptome, including 10 419 IncRNA genes in the
current version.

1 INTRODUCTION

Large-scale studies in recent years have revealed that mammalian
genomes encode thousands of long (>200 nt) transcripts that lack
coding capacity, but are otherwise messenger RNA-like. These
are collectively referred to as long non-coding RNAs (lnCRNAs)
(Mercer et (11., 2009). Although their overall biological importance
has been debated, early functional examples were discovered more
than 20 years ago, notably H19 (Brannan et (11., 1990) and XIST
(Brown et (11., 1991). Novel lnCRNAs are now being uncovered at
an increasing rate, with molecular functions that include recruitment
of histone-modifying complexes to Chromatin [e.g. HOTAIR and
HOTTIP (Rinn et (11., 2007; Wang et (11., 2011)] and modulation
of transcription and splicing by molecular interaction with relevant
factors [e.g. GAS5 and MAIATI (Bernard et (11., 2010; Kino et (11.,
2010)].

A small number of studies describe interactions between small
and lnCRNAs, with lnCRNAs acting either as inhibitory decoys
of microRNAs (Ebert and Sharp, 2010) or as regulatory targets.
In humans, miR-671 targets an antisense transcript of the human
CDRI gene (Hansen et (11., 2011), and miR-29 can regulate the
lnCRNA MEG3 in hepatocellular cancer, although only indirectly
(Braconi et (11., 2011). Long non-coding transcripts that derive

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

from ultra-conserved regions (T-UCRs) have also been suggested
to be microRNA targets (Calin et (11., 2007). In plants, the IPSl
lnCRNA inhibits miR-399 through a sponge/decoy effect (Franco-
Zorrilla et (11., 2007). Herpesvirus-encoded RNAs can bind and
inhibit human host miR-27 (Cazalla et (11., 2010), and the HULC
lnCRNA can bind and sequester miR-372 in liver cancer (Wang et (11.,
2010). A pseudogene of the PTEN tumor suppressor can compete
for microRNA binding with its coding counterpart (Poliseno et (11.,
2010), and microRNA inhibition by lnCRNAs is important during
muscle differentiation (Cesana et (11., 2011). The decoy hypothesis
is further supported by the observation that microRNAs with many
targets in the cell tend to have a diluted effect on each individual
target (Arvey et (11., 2010).

A recent study used lentiviral small hairpin RNAs to silence
147 lnCRNAs at an average efﬁcacy of 75% (Guttman et (11.,
2011), demonstrating that lnCRNAs in general are susceptible to
regulation by Argonaute—small RNA complexes despite frequent
nuclear localization. However, existing web-accessible microRNA
target prediction databases, such as PiCTar (Krek et (11., 2005),
miRanda (Betel et (11., 2008) or TargetScan (Friedman et (11., 2009),
are focused on 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of coding genes and
fail to provide predictions for the long non-coding transcriptome.

To simplify the study of microRNA—lnCRNA interactions, we here
describe miRcode: a comprehensive map of putative microRNA
target sites across the GENCODE long non-coding transcriptome
(10 419/15 977 lnCRNAs genes/transcripts in the current version
based on GENCODE V11). miRcode is designed to be an easy to
use, web-based tool, with search ﬁinctionalities to aid hypothesis
generation starting from a lnCRNA or microRNA of interest. Custom
genome browser views and downloadable tab-delimited ﬁles are
also accessible through the miRcode web interface. miRcode
additionally covers other GENCODE gene Classes, including 12 549
pseudogenes and 19 999 coding genes both in typical (3’-UTR) and
atypical (5’-UTR and CD5) positions.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

miRcode identiﬁes putative target sites based on established
principles: seed complementarity and evolutionary conservation (see
Supplementary Material for detailed methods). The seed region,
encompassing bases 2—8 from the 5’-end of the microRNA, is the
major sequence determinant of microRNA targeting (Lewis et (11.,
2003). The miRcode pipeline (Fig. 1), implemented using Perl,
Matlab, PHP and MySQL, searches for complementary matches to
established (Friedman et (11., 2009) microRNA seed families across
GENCODE (Harrow et (11., 2006) transcripts. We consider 7-mers

these are only marginally effective (Grimson et (11., 2007; Selbach

GENCODE represents a comprehensive, high-quality description
of the polyA+ transcriptome. It is updated on a regular basis and
based largely on full-length or near full-length complementary
DNA evidence and additionally contains many known RNA genes
and microRNAs. Although all of GENCODE is analyzed and
accessible in miRcode, we deﬁne a subset of lncRNA genes
that produce only predicted non-coding transcripts with a mature
(spliced) length of >200 nt. lncRNAs are further subdivided
into intergenic (not overlapping with any coding gene) and non-
intergenic.

To assess evolutionary conservation, a 46-way Multiz vertebrate
genomic multiple alignment (Blanchette et (11., 2004; Fujita et (11.,
2011) is remapped onto transcripts, and site conservation levels
are determined based on site presence in primates, non-primate
mammals and non-mammal vertebrates. Transcript regions (3’-
UTR, CDS and 5’-UTR in case of coding genes) and possible
overlaps with repeat sequences are recorded for each site. Sites are
mapped ﬁrst to transcripts to allow identiﬁcation of splice-junction-
spanning sites, and subsequently aggregated into non-redundant
gene-level sets. Predictions are ﬁnally made accessible through a
web interface.

3 FUNCHONAUTY

The miRcode interface provides basic search functionality for
ﬁnding putative microRNA—target sites in lncRNAs of interest
or predicted targets of speciﬁc microRNAs. Sites are returned in
the form of lists, aggregated on genes, where conservation levels
(fraction of species where site is present) are presented separately
for primates, non-primate placental mammals and non-mammal
vertebrates. In addition, custom UCSC browser views enable
browsing of target sites in a genome context. Tab-delimited text ﬁles
and BED ﬁles provide convenient access to whole-transcriptome
target predictions for use in computational projects.

In summary, we provide, in several formats, a pan-GENCODE
microRNA site map to facilitate further investigation into microRNA
regulation of lncRNAs as well as other atypical target regions such
as pseudogenes and 5’-UTRs.

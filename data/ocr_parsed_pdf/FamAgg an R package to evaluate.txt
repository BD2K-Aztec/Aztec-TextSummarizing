Abstract

Summary: Familial aggregation analysis is the first fundamental step to perform when assessing
the extent of genetic background of a disease. However, there is a lack of software to analyze the fa—
milial clustering of complex phenotypes in very large pedigrees. Such pedigrees can be utilized to
calculate measures that express trait aggregation on both the family and individual level, providing
valuable directions in choosing families for detailed follow—up studies. We developed FamAgg,
an open source R package that contains both established and novel methods to investigate familial
aggregation of traits in large pedigrees. We demonstrate its use and interpretation by analyzing
a publicly available cancer dataset with more than 20 000 participants distributed across approxi—

mately 400 families.

Availability and implementation: The FamAgg package is freely available at the Bioconductor re—

posito ry, http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/FamAgg.

1 Introduction

The investigation of whether a disease or symptom trait recurs more
often among close relatives than in the general population is a deeply
rooted subject in genetic epidemiology, often termed as familial aggre-
gation analysis (Khoury et (11., 1993). While segregation analysis was
the tool of choice to identify patterns of Mendelian diseases, there is
no unique method to highlight familial clusters for complex diseases,
especially in situations involving very large pedigrees lacking a regular
family structure. In this setting, more than three decades ago, a com-
putational method was first developed to highlight familial aggrega-
tion of various cancer types (Hill, 1980). The method was based on
the kinship coefficient (1),), which is the probability that two subjects i
and j share the same allele identical-by-descent at one locus, and rep-
resents a suitable measure to quantify the relationship between two
individuals in the pedigree (Malécot, 1948). In this early approach,
the average kinship between all affected pairs was compared to the

mean kinship of multiple sets of randomly selected matched controls
(Hill, 1980). This and other kinship-based methods have been suc-
cessfully applied to very large pedigrees to assess whether diseases
such as autism (Jorde et (11., 1990) or Parkinson’s disease
(Sveinbjornsdottir et (11., 2000) showed evidence of familial aggrega-
tion. The kinship-based approach was also extended to be used with
time-to-event data: the presence of familial clustering is assessed
based on disease incidence rates, thus accounting for the time to dis-
ease onset (Kerber, 1995).

Driven by the lack of open access tools for familial aggregation
analyses in large pedigrees, we have developed an R package provid-
ing this functionality. Besides basic pedigree analysis, sub-setting
and plotting methods, it implements the previously published meth-
ods based on average kinship and disease incidence rates as well as
two novel approaches to detect familial aggregation employing stat-
istics based on kinship coefficients combined with Monte Carlo
simulation techniques.

longitudinal study on cancer in the state of Minnesota (USA) in
1944. There are 1376 cases spread over these 426 families with a
median family size of 53 members, the largest family comprises of
382 individuals in six generations. The performed tests did not
utilize sampling stratification and the null distributions were calcu—
lated with N : 50 000 sampling steps. Runtimes on a single
2.4GHz processor of a MacBook Pro with 16GB of memory are
as follows: FIR test, 2 s; GIF test, 7min; KS test, 23 min; and KG
test, 3 h. At a significance level of 0.05, the KS test and the GIF test
identified 42 and 34 families with a significant enrichment of
cases, respectively. Figure 1A highlights the 14 families with filled
symbols where both the KS and the GIF tests identified significant
familial aggregation. Figure 13 provides an example of a smaller
family with breast cancer aggregation. The p—values are 2.4 X 10’3
for the GIF test and 1.3 X 10’2 for individual 410 according to the
KS test.

Figure 1 demonstrates that there is a certain agreement between
the methods. However, differences in the results from distinct meth—
ods are expected as each method is based on a slightly different ap—
proach to identify familial aggregation and therefore reports
different families at a specified significance level. We recommend
bearing in mind the underlying statistical test when interpreting the
results of a specific method.

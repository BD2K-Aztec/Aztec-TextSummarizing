predicted breakpoints were experimentally veriﬁed (n = 3;
Supplementary Fig. S2). Notably, while our capture panel was
designed to target ALK and ROS] without knowledge of their
partners, FACTERA readily identiﬁed both known (EML4,
KIFSB, SLC34A2 and CD74) and novel translocation partners
for these genes.

Next, we assessed FACTERA’s sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
Because all 14 fusions involving ALK or ROS] were either ex—
perimentally conﬁrmed or represent a reciprocal partner of a
validated fusion, we considered all such events true positives.
Previous whole—genome sequencing studies reported a mean of
1(L100 structural rearrangements per NSCLC tumor (Govindan
et al., 2012; Imielinski et al., 2012), indicating that less than one
fusion should be expected within our 125 kb capture panel by
random chance. The ALK and ROS] fusions are, therefore,
likely to comprise most, if not all, of the detectable structural
rearrangements within our eight sequencing samples, suggesting
a high sensitivity. Because the remaining candidate fusions
(KRTAP5—5/KRTAP5—7) identiﬁed by FACTERA map to re—
petitive genomic regions, they arguably represent false positives
arising from misalignment. These candidates were readily elimi—
nated using the UCSC RepeatMasker track, resulting in 100%
speciﬁcity without affecting true positives (Supplementary
Methods). If this step was omitted, FACTERA achieved a spe—
ciﬁcity of 88% (14 of 16 fusions).

Using the same datasets, we then compared FACTERA re—
sults with ﬁve previous fusion detection methods (Table 1,
Supplementary Table S2) (Chen et al., 2009; Hart et al., 2013;
Rausch et al., 2012; Schroder et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011).
Only Socrates and DELLY achieved a sensitivity of 100%
relative to FACTERA; however, both reported many more
candidate fusions (Table 1). As such, we examined their outputs
for concordant predictions, reasoning that any such events
might represent true fusions. From > 1400 candidates compared,
only 15 fusions were found in common between them, of
which 14 were also identiﬁed by FACTERA (Supplementary
Table S3).

bSpeciﬁcity is 3.7% if candidate fusions with <100bp between breakpoints are
removed.

CWhile BreakDancer was not designed to precisely resolve junctional sequences,
it did identify the correct gene partners for all true—positive fusions.

Because the remaining candidates were unique to each
method, we assessed whether they could be false positives.
We evaluated HCC78 genomic DNA by PCR for putative
fusions called by either DELLY or Socrates, but not both
(Supplementary Fig. S3, Supplementary Table S4). Consistent
with our concordance analysis, none of these fusion candi—
dates could be detected, suggesting they arose from library
preparation or sequencing—related artifacts. In contrast, pri—
mers targeting SLC34A2—ROS] (a fusion identified by all
three methods) yielded the correct product (Supplementary
Fig. S3).

Finally, a 715bp fusion within EIF3E (patient P7) was pre—
dicted by both DELLY and Socrates, but missed by FACTERA.
While FACTERA was originally used to detect intergene
fusions, when reapplied to detect inter— and intragenetic events
(Section 2), the same fusion was identiﬁed along with all
14 fusions previously detected, with zero false positives
(Supplementary Table S2).

4 CONCLUSONS

The low speciﬁcity of previous methods highlights the need for
novel and more accurate DNA fusion detection approaches.
We have shown that FACTERA is a highly sensitive and speciﬁc
method for the detection of fusion genes and breakpoints
in targeted sequencing data. Moreover, FACTERA can be
applied to any BAM ﬁle with paired—end and soft—clipped
reads, including data from whole genome shotgun sequencing
(see Supplementary Notes). Although originally implemented
for fusion detection in ctDNA applications, we plan to continue
developing FACTERA to facilitate broader usage, including
adding support for CPU parallelization, untemplated DNA seg—
ments (e.g. N—D—N regions in V(D)J rearrangements of the
immunoglobulin heavy chain locus) and single—read datasets.

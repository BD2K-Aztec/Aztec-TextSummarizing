which can be used to develop custom import programs to sup—
port more complicated data sources. A procedure to import data
encoded in the HICDEP (hicdep.org) format directly into
RegaDB is currently under development.

A research database will generally be accessed via the Internet;
therefore, authentication is an important security aspect.
RegaDB supports password—based authentication by default.
The authentication module abstraction allows for a straightfor—
ward implementation of alternative authentication back—ends
(OpenId, Kerberos, etc.), which makes it possible for RegaDB
to connect to existing user management systems. The application
will only allow registered users to access the system. Once
granted access to the system, a user is only able to access patient
information that belongs to a dataset connected to the user’s
proﬁle. The owner of the dataset can configure the access of
users to this dataset, and revoke the access after a certain analysis
or assignment is ﬁnished.

Researchers can query RegaDB using the visual query tool,
which allows users to deﬁne complex queries guided by a user
interface. Query deﬁnitions can be saved and re—run every time
an update of the data becomes available. Work is in progress to
support the use of predeﬁned SQL—based queries via the user
interface. Query results can be exported to a CSV and/or
FASTA ﬁle. It is possible to set—up an analysis workﬁow by
conﬁguring a query to execute a python post processing script.
If the script generates statistical data in a graphical format, this is
visualized in the query user interface after the query has been
executed.

When researchers make their tools available as web services,
they can be easily integrated in RegaDB, lowering the threshold
for clinicians and virologists to use such tools.

RegaDB has been used in several collaborations including the
Virolab EC project (virolab.org). Data from several European
hospitals were stored in one RegaDB instance, resulting in a
combined dataset of >8000 sequences. During the last phase of
the project, we were able to combine our efforts with another EC
project, EUResist (euresist.org), resulting in a combined data—
base of >55 000 sequences.

Another example of the utility of RegaDB is the collaborative
database used within the Southern African Treatment and
Resistance Network (SATuRN). This network has 24 member
institutions working in Southern Africa, the region at the
epicentre of the HIV epidemic. Currently there are >10 institu—
tions using the SATuRN RegaDB for patient data management,

data curation and research. Under SATuRN, >7000 genotypes
with treatment and monitoring data have been collected. Using
the built—in customized report and query functionality, data of
speciﬁc attributes are selected, analysed and used to answer spe—
ciﬁc clinical and research questions (de Oliveira et al., 2010;
Manasa et al., 2012). In addition, members of the SATuRN
project recently published a book (Rossouw et al., 2013) contain—
ing a series of case studies used for training. More than 1450
physicians and nurses have been trained through conferences,
workshops and online web—tutorials.

4 AVAILABILITY AND USAGE

RegaDB is a software application that can be downloaded from
the Internet and installed in a health care or research institute.
Documentation, source ﬁles and binaries are available on
http://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/regadb. Because of its modular and
ﬂexible design, RegaDB can be used in many different contexts
and settings, from managing patient data in a clinical environ—
ment to setting up large—scale research collaborations. Currently,
all RegaDB instances are private instances that can only be ac—
cessed by a restricted user base. Some of these instances are ac—
cessible on the Internet; others are only accessible from within
the institute’s intranet.

The current version of the software is already used for storing
genetic data of HIV—1, HIV—2, HTLV (Araujo et al., 2012) and
HCV isolates and related patient and clinical information.

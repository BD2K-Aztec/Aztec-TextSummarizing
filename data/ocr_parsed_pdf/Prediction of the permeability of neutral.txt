Abstract

Motivation: Determination of drug absorption is an important component of the drug discovery
and development process in that it plays a key role in the decision to promote drug candidates to
clinical trials. We have developed a method that, on the basis of an analysis of the dynamic distri—
bution of water molecules around a compound obtained by molecular dynamics simulations, can
compute a parameter—free value that correlates very well with the compound permeability meas—
ured using the human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco—2) cell line assay.

Results: The method has been tested on twenty—three neutral drugs for which a consistent set of
experimental data is available. We show here that our method reproduces the experimental data
better than other existing tools. Furthermore it provides a detailed view of the relationship between

the hydration and the permeability properties of molecules.

1 Introduction

The study of drug absorption is of critical importance in the devel—
opment of effective drugs. The path of a drug from the site of admin—
istration to its target cells or compartments implies the crossing of
several semipermeable cell membranes, therefore it is relevant to be
able to predict whether and to which extent a molecule can pass
through the cell membranes.

Passive permeation of drugs through the biological cell mem—
branes is obviously strongly dependent on the molecule physico—
chemical properties (Meanwell, 2011). It has been established that
the acid—base character of the molecule (which inﬂuences the charge
of the molecule at the specific pH), its lipophilicity (which affects its
partition between aqueous and lipid environments) and solubility
are the most relevant parameters to take into account. These param—
eters are well described by the molecule hydropathy profile (Siew
et (11., 2012; Smith et (11., 2010). A more lipophilic drug is more
likely to effectively cross the hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer. On
the other hand, extremely hydrophobic molecules, insoluble in

aqueous body ﬂuids, might be poorly absorbed (Frenkel et (11.,
2005). In summary, there should be an appropriate balance between
the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of a molecule (Ghuman et (11.,
2005; Seelig et (11., 1994; Waring, 2009).

From an experimental point of view, data on permeability can be
obtained by in situ and/or in vivo animal studies, but these are time
consuming and expensive experiments and therefore only performed
towards the end of the drug development process. Efforts have
therefore focused on the development of in vitro permeability assays
that can mimic the relevant characteristics of in vivo absorption.
Among these, there are the Parallel Artificial Membrane
Permeability Assay (PAMPA) (Avdeef et (11., 2007), the human colon
adenocarcinoma (Caco—2) cell line assay (Artursson et (11., 2001), the
Madin—Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell assay (Irvine et (11.,
1999), the rat duodenal immortalized cell line assay (2/4A1 cell)
(Tavelin et (11., 2003), and the rat everted gut sac assay (Bohets
et (11., 2001). All of them are routinely used for the preliminary as—
sessment of drug permeability. In particular, the Caco—2 cell is

probably the most extensively characterized cell—based model and
the most popular both in the pharmaceutical industry and in aca—
demia (Balimane et al., 2006). It has been shown that this model can
effectively predict the human initial drug absorption (Artursson and
Karlsson, 1991) because it reﬂects the transport of the drug across a
cell membrane rather than the interaction of the drug with the lipid
bilayer (Hou et al., 2006).

The membrane permeability for a given compound is usually
estimated from its partition coefficient, logP, defined as the loga—
rithm of the relative concentration of the molecule when it partitions
between a two—phase system, usually water and octanol, where the
latter is assumed to have a lipophilicity comparable to that of a cell
membrane (Artursson et al., 2001; Seddon et al., 2009).

From the theoretical point of view, many computational
approaches have been developed to infer drug properties, such as
bioavailability, aqueous solubility, initial absorption, plasma—
protein binding and toxicity (van de Waterbeemd and Gifford,
2003). These are often related to features such as molecular size,
hydrophobicity, or number of hydrogen bonds established by the
compound with water molecules (since these bonds need to be bro—
ken to allow the molecule to pass the membrane) (Hou et al., 2004).

In general, permeability may be estimated in terms of the free en—
ergy barrier that the drug should overcome when crossing the mem—
brane, which is usually predicted from computationally intensive
molecular dynamics simulations of the translocation process
(Carpenter et al., 2014; Meng and Xu, 2013). Some methods com—
pute the Polar Surface Area (PSA) of the drug to predict its perme—
ability under the assumption that this parameter correlates with the
hydrogen—bonding pattern in the aqueous solvent of the molecule
and therefore with the energy cost of transferring the molecule from
the solvent to the membrane (Kelder et al., 1999; Stenberg et al.,
1999).

Other popular methods are the Quantitative Structure—Property
Relationship (QSAR) analysis (Yu and Adedoyin, 2003), Multiple
Linear Regression (MLR), Partial Least Square (PLS), Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Artificial Neutral Networks
(ANNs), Genetic Algorithms (Gas), Support Vector Machines
(SVMs) and the ‘Lipinski rule of five’ (Lipinski, 2000). In particu—
lar, the Lipinski’s rule takes into account different features to as—
sess whether a compound is likely to be cell membrane permeable
and easily absorbed by the body on the basis of the following crite—
ria: molecular weight of the compound lower than 500; logP lower
than 5; number of hydrogen bond donors (usually the number of
hydroxyl and amine groups in a drug molecule) lower than 5; num—
ber of groups that can accept hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen
bonds (estimated by the number of oxygen and nitrogen atoms)
lower than 10.

In this work we describe a new method based on an estimate of
the hydropathy and charge distribution of a compound deduced
from the distribution and orientation of the water molecules around
it. We have already successfully used a similar approach to estimate
the hydrophobicity of the twenty natural amino acids (Bonella et al.,
2014). Here we show that, when applied to a set of 23 drugs, neutral
at physiological pH, to compute their hydrophobicity and charge
distribution, the method can effectively predict their ability to cross
the plasma membrane.

Our dataset only includes neutral compounds since these are
well known to mainly use passive transport to cross the phospho—
lipid bilayer of the cell membrane (Neuhoff et al., 2003, 2005;
Seelig, 2007) and therefore their diffusion and permeability is essen—
tially related to their chemico—physical properties that is what our
method can infer.

2 Methods

We analyzed the hydration of small solutes by investigating the
changes in the structure of the dynamic hydrogen bond network
formed by the water molecules surrounding them as well as their
orientation as obtained by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.

2.1 Molecular dynamics

All simulations were performed using NAMD 2.7b1 (Phillips et al.,
2005) and the CHARMM force field was used for the investigated
compounds (MacKerell et al., 1998). In each simulation a single sol—
ute molecule was located in a cubic simulation box (with imposed
periodic boundary conditions) filled with TIP4P rigid water mol—
ecules (Abascal and Vega, 2005 ). Each simulation contained a single
copy of the compound and the size of the box varied in a range of
56—62  depending on the compound considered. The topologies
and parameters for the small molecule compounds were obtained
via the SwissParam server (Zoete et al., 201 1) [www.swissparam.ch]
that generates molecules topologies and parameters for small or—
ganic compounds in a functional form that is compatible with the
CHARMM force field.

The Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method was used to calculate
the electrostatic interactions. Each simulation was run for 1.5 ns.
A 1 fs time step was used and the coordinates were retrieved every
0.5 ps. All simulations were performed at T : 310 K, and the system
was thermostated using Langevin dynamics. The simulations were
performed also at constant pressure using a modified Nose—Hoover
method in which Langevin dynamics is used to control ﬂuctuations
in the barostat (Hoover, 1985). More details about the molecular
dynamics simulation parameters are available at: http://arianna.
med.uniroma1.it/neutraldrugs/.

2.2 Dataset

We used a sample set of structurally diverse, small molecular weight
drugs analyzed by Yazdanian et al. (1998) for which in vitro Caco—2
cell permeability data is available. We selected 23 neutral drugs at
pH 7.4 from this dataset.

The advantage of selecting this specific dataset is that the data
have been obtained in the same experimental conditions. To verify
how representative our dataset is, we collected data for 131 com—
pounds available in the literature for a total of 277 Caco—2 cell per—
meability values (different values have been obtained for a number
of these drugs in different experimental conditions) (Artursson,
1990; Artursson and Karlsson, 1991; Artursson and Magnusson,
1990; Augustijns et al., 1996; Aungst et al., 2000; Chong et al.,
1997; Collett et al., 1996; Gres et al., 1998; Haeberlin et al., 1993;
Hilgendorf et al., 2000; Hou et al., 2004; Hovgaard et al., 1995;
Lentz et al., 2000; Liang et al., 2000; Rubas et al., 1993; Ruiz—
Garcia et al., 2002; Saba and Kou, 2002; Schipper et al., 2001; Wu
et al., 2000; Yee 1997; Zhu et al., 2002) and compared both their
Cac02 experimental values (Supplementary Figure S1) and their
structural features.

To estimate the latter, we computed the structural dissimilarity
of our selected compounds and compared it with that of the 131
compounds. To this end, we used the ChemMine tool (Backman
et al., 2011) that takes into account parameters such as partition co—
efficient, rule—of—five, partial charges, fingerprint calculation and
more (for a detailed description of the features see ‘http://www.ra.
cs.uniuebingen.de/software/joelib/tutorial/descriptors/descriptors.
html’). We used these values to perform a clustering analysis, using
the ‘hclust’ function of R software package (Ihaka and Gentleman,

1996) [http://www.R—project.org], the results of which are shown in
Supplementary Figure S2.

As it can be seen, the 23 compounds from the Yazdanian et al.
(1998) dataset, selected for the analysis, span quite uniformly about
85% of the available range both in terms of Cac02 values and of
structural features. Some regions of the feature space are less well
represented in our dataset (left most branch of the tree in
Supplementary Figure S2). These are all compounds with a rather
large molecular weight (above 500 Da). This might imply that our
method might behave differently for very large compounds (that in
any case are usually excluded a priori as leads because of their size).

All compound three—dimensional coordinates were downloaded
from the free public database ZINC (Irwin et al., 2012) [zinc.dockin—
g.org]. For this study the following small molecule compounds were
chosen: Griseofulvin, Aminopyrine, Piroxicam, Diazepam, Nevirapine,
Phenytoin, Testosterone, Progesterone, Clonidine, Corticosterone,
Estradiol, Hydrocortisone, Dexamethasone, Scopolamine, Zidovudine,
Urea, Uracil, Sucrose, Hydrochlorothiazide, Mannitol, Ganciclovir,
Acyclovir and Chlorothiazide (Table 2). Of importance, they cover
a wide range of permeability values (Pcaco—2), from 36.6 X 10’6 cm/s
to 0.19>< 10’6cm/s and are as evenly distributed as possible (see
Table 2).

2.3 Data analysis

The results of the molecular dynamics simulations of each molecule
are used to evaluate the orientation of the water molecules in the
first and second hydration shell, being the first related to the hydro—
philic and the second to the hydrophobic characteristics of the com—
pound, respectively (see ref (Bonella et al., 2014) for details).

We represent each water molecule as a tetrahedron, where an
sp3—hybridized oxygen atom lies at the center and two hydrogen
atoms and two lone pair electrons point to the vertices. Each water
molecule can then form up to four hydrogen bonds with other water
molecules. According to this model of the water molecule, we can
define four Hydrogen Bond Vectors (HBVs) and one dipole vector
(Fig. 1). The HBVs are defined as the lines connecting the oxygen
atom and the vertices of the tetrahedron (in blue in the Fig. 1). The
dipole vector (in red in the Fig. 1) lies along the bisectrix of the angle
formed by the oxygen and the two hydrogen atoms.

We can define the angles related to hydrogen bond orientations
(0,71, 0,72, 0,73 and 0,74) as those formed by the straight line linking
the solute atom with the oxygen atom of the nearest water molecule
and the hydrogen bond vector (for clarity, only one of the four
angles is represented in blue in Fig. 1). Similarly, we can define the
angle 0d related to the orientation of the dipole vector as the angle
formed by the straight line connecting a solute atom (S in Fig. 1) to
the oxygen atom of the closest water molecule (in black) and the di—
pole vector of the molecule itself (in red). The different orientations
of the water molecules around a solute can be used to analyze the
compound hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity. In fact a water mol—
ecule in the vicinity of a hydrophobic solute positions one of the
faces of the tetrahedron toward the solute. On the other hand, for a
hydrophilic solute, a water molecule reorients to point toward the
compound with one of its vertices. We need to take the dipole vector
into account because the four vertices of the tetrahedron represent—
ing the waters are equivalent in our model and therefore it would be
impossible to distinguish between positive and negative partial
charges without considering 0d.

At each step of the molecular dynamics simulation, we can meas—
ure the values of the five angles (0,71, 0,72, 0,73, 0,74 and 0d) and the
distance R (A) between each water molecule and the nearest solute

atom and compute the probability of finding a water molecule with
a given orientation and around at a given distance from the solute
atoms.

The hydropathy and charge distribution properties are computed
from the conditional probability density of the waters in the appro—
priate intervals of the angles and distances described before. We can
build two three—dimensional histograms for each simulation; the
first reports the conditional probability density P(0;,,-IR) (for i : 1, 2,
3, 4), the second is the conditional probability density P(0dIR). R is
defined as the distance between each solute atom and the oxygen
atom of the nearest water molecule. The histogram distance and
angle bins were set to 0.05  and 1°, respectively (Bonella et al.,
2014)

2.4 Molecular descriptors

The analysis of the conditional probability density distributions
allows us to compute four indices, named I,,, In, 1+ and I_, obtained
by summing the intensity of the peaks in the appropriate angle and
distance range.

As described in more detail in our previous work (Bonella et al.,
2014), the distribution P(0;,,-IR) permits to distinguish between the
hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of a compound on the basis of
the probability values observed in the first and second hydration
shell, respectively. Intuitively, this is justified by the fact that a polar
solute will establish Coulomb interactions with the closest water
molecules and this situation will contribute to the peaks observed in
the first hydration shell of the hydrogen bond histogram, while a
hydrophobic (or apolar) solute will cause the waters to orient them—
selves as to maximize the number of hydrogen bonds with neighbor—
ing waters, forming a cage around the solute, and will contribute to
peaks in the second hydration shell in the hydrogen bond histogram.

The dipole probability density P(0(1IR) in the first hydration shell
takes into account which of the vertices of the tetrahedron

green, is shown in the figure). Hydrogen atoms are represented as dark grey
circles. We also define the dipole vector of the water molecule (red arrow)
and compute the angle 9d between this vector and the line connecting the sol-
ute atom and the oxygen (in blue)

representing the waters (all equivalent in our model) is oriented to—
wards the solute and therefore provides information about the elec—
tric charge (positive or negative) of the interacting solute atoms.

We define the compound hydrophilicity 13, and hydrophobicity
1,, as the sum of the hydrogen bond probability densities, computed
over the appropriate distance and angle range (A0 and AR) in the
first and second shell of hydration, respectively. The charge indices
1+ and I_ are defined as the sum, in the appropriate range, of the
probability densities in the first shell of the distribution related to di—
pole moment (see Fig. 2). For more details, see ref. (Babiaczyk et al.,
2010; Bonella et al., 2014).

As shown in Supplementary Figure S3a—c, the length of the
MD simulation (1.5 ns) is sufficient to ensure convergence of the
indices.

The scheme used to select the boundaries of the region (A0 and
AR) is based on Guassian fits. In particular, we performed a
Gaussian fit of the probability distribution for both the first and se—
cond hydration shell along the 0 axis (see Supplementary Fig. S4)
and determined the average and standard deviation of the Guassian
distributions for each of the compounds. The average of these values
is used to compute the volume of each peak. A similar approach has
been used to determine the range of integration along the R axis.

The analytical details of the scheme used to select the boundaries
of the region (A0 and AR) are described in the supporting informa—
tion. The scripts for running the simulations and perform the ana—
lysis are available at: http://arianna.med.uniroma1.it/neutraldrugs/.

tion. The pink arrow indicates the contribution of the negative charge

2.5 Statistical analysis and comparison with other
methods

The program used to analyze the molecular dynamics trajectories
and to build the histograms was written in Fortran90. The R pack—
age (Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996) [http://www.R—project.org] was
used to analyze the histograms. The same package was used to cal—
culate the indices, perform the Gaussian fitting and the Multiple
Regression Analysis (MRA), compute the Pearson’s correlation coef—
ficient, (r) and perform the cross validation analysis. The clustering
analysis was performed using the Euclidean distance and via the
‘hclust’ function from the ‘Stats’ package of R (in particular, the
‘average’ method of the ‘hclust’ function was used).

We compared our results with those of several other methods. In
particular we computed, for each of the 23 compounds, the pre—
dicted permeability values according to the two methods described
in ref. (Fujiwara et al., 2002), based on a linear combination of mo—
lecular descriptors (Fuij_1), or including quadratic terms (Fuij_2).
We also compared our results with those obtained by a linear regres—
sion (Hou) and a multiple linear regression (Guangli and Yiyu,
2006) (Gua_1) method. Finally we also used for comparison the
Support Vector Machine based method (Gua_2) described in ref.
(Guangli and Yiyu, 2006)

3 Results

In silico permeability prediction is consistent with available pub—
lished data. We computed four indicators (I,,, 1”, 1+ and I_)
described in the Methods section for each of the drugs in our data—
set. As explained in detail in the Methods section, these indices are
derived from the conditional probability of finding a water molecule
with a given orientation around the solute atoms estimated from the
results of molecular dynamics simulations. In particular, the first
two (I3, and I”) provide information about the hydrophilic and
hydrophobic properties of the compound and are computed from
the probability values of finding water molecules in the first and se—
cond hydration shells, respectively. 1+ and I_ are related to the di—
pole orientation of the water molecules surrounding the analyzed
compound and therefore to the effect of its positive and negative
charges.

The values of the indices for the analyzed molecules are reported
in Supplementary Table S1. Three of these parameter—free indicators
(1”, 1+ and I_) correlate remarkably well with the permeability data
while the Iy index shows a lower level of correlation.

We tested whether a combination of these indices can represent a
good proxy for estimating the permeability of a molecule. To this
end, we used a multiple linear regression algorithm as implemented
in the R function ‘lm’ (Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996) to find the
weights providing the best correlation with the Caco—2 experimental
data. The tool also provides the probability P—value of a computed
coefficient to be different from 0. We tested both linear and quad—
ratic terms in the regression. The best correlation is obtained by a
linear fit of the 1,, and I_ indices (P—value < 0.001), while 1,, and 1+
were found to contribute very little to the overall correlation
(P—value > 0.05). This is consistent with the values of their correl—
ation coefficients (see Table 1).

The regression model corresponding to the best fit is:

PPM : (a>r<I,,) + (b>r<I_) + c (1)

where a : 3.06 (P—value : 4.7 X 10—7), 0 : 0.04 (P—value :
2.6 X 10—3) and c : 3092 (P—value : 4.0 X 1077).

In Table 1 we also report the correlation between each index and
the Caco—2 permeability values. As aspect the highest linear correl—
ation value is between 1,, index (hydrophobic index) and Caco—2 per—
meability value because a more lipophilic drug is more likely to
effectively cross the hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer. More inter—
esting is the correlation linked to positive charge distribution index
I1. It can be observed that the index with the highest value of nega—
tive correlation is I1, indicating that most likely positive groups pre—
vent uptake of compounds more than negative ones (see also
Supplementary Fig. S5).

Table 2 reports the predicted Ppred permeability values obtain—
ing using Eq. (1) for all the drugs considered and shows that they

reproduce very well the experimental Caco—2 permeability values
(Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r : 91%). We also performed a
cross validation analysis by repeatedly leaving out 20% of the com—
pounds (testing sets) and re—computing the coefficients of Eq. (1) on
the remaining ones (training sets) as described in the Methods sec—
tion. We iterated this procedure 10 000 times, randomly choosing
the training set at each step. The predicted average values (Ppredicv)
obtained for each drug in the test set are reported in Table 2. Once
again, the correlation between prediction and experiment is very sat—
isfactory (88%) (Fig. 3).

The coefficients of Eq. (1) are also very stable. Their average
value and standard deviation obtained in the 10 000 cross valid—
ation runs are: a: 3.064 t 0.194, b : 0.043 t 0.005 and
c : —3091.866 : 195.453.

The average difference between the predicted and experimental
values is 4.7 X 10’6 cm/s. It is relevant to mention here that the
threshold used to discriminate between low absorbance and high ab—
sorbance compounds is usually set to 8.0 X 10’6 cm/s (Castillo—
Garit, et al., 2008) and the data shown in Table 1 demonstrate that
only in two cases (Acyclovir and Zidovudine) our method would
significantly misclassify the compound.

In summary, Eq. (1) describes well the permeability properties of
neutral compounds. It is worth noticing that the Ppred value is well
balanced in the sense that it overestimates and underestimates the
experimental values in a similar number of cases (11 and 12
respectively).

We compared our results with those of several other methods (as
described in the Methods section) and the results are reported in
Table 3 and Supplementary Figure S6a—e. It can be appreciated that
the correlation between predicted and experimental values is higher
for our method. The average error is lower than all other tested
methods, but for the Gua_2 method (Guangli and Yiyu, 2006) that
shows a very similar value.

4 Conclusion

We have shown here that an approach based on the simultaneous
analysis of molecule hydrophobicity and charge distribution has the
potential to accurately predict the passive plasma membrane perme—
ability of neutral drugs. This method may be useful for investigating
the mechanism of passive permeation of small neutral compounds
since it can easily provide information on the role that every single
atom plays on the hydration process.

Our Ppred indicator correlates very well with the experimentally
determined Caco—2 permeability values and performs better than
other available methods. Furthermore, it only requires the know—
ledge of the chemical structure of the compound. Given the cost and
impact of late stage failures in drug development we believe that the
relatively high computational cost of running the molecular dy—
namics simulations (an average of 48 hours on a 20 CPU server for
each molecule) is not necessarily a relevant drawback of the
approach.

As is the case also for several in vitro methods, our method can—
not estimate the permeability of drugs that use an active uptake sys—
tem. In these cases, additional techniques, such as docking the
compounds to efﬂux/inﬂux protein models, should be explored.

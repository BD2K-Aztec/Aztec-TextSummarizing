Abstract

Motivation: Modern high—throughput biotechnologies such as microarray are capable of producing a
massive amount of information for each sample. However, in a typical high—throughput experiment,
only limited number of samples were assayed, thus the classical 'large p, small n’ problem. On the
other hand, rapid propagation of these high—throughput technologies has resulted in a substantial
collection of data, often carried out on the same platform and using the same protocol. It is highly de—
sirable to utilize the existing data when performing analysis and inference on a new dataset.

Results: Utilizing existing data can be carried out in a straightforward fashion under the Bayesian
framework in which the repository of historical data can be exploited to build informative priors
and used in new data analysis. In this work, using microarray data, we investigate the feasibility
and effectiveness of deriving informative priors from historical data and using them in the problem
of detecting differentially expressed genes. Through simulation and real data analysis, we show
that the proposed strategy significantly outperforms existing methods including the popular and
state—of—the—art Bayesian hierarchical model—based approaches. Our work illustrates the feasibility
and benefits of exploiting the increasingly available genomics big data in statistical inference and
presents a promising practical strategy for dealing with the 'large p, small n’ problem.

1 Introduction

High—throughput technologies such as microarray and next gener—
ation sequencing have become indispensable tools in biomedical re—
search. These technologies can generate a rich set of information for
each biological sample, which can be summarized into a comprehen—
sive picture of the underlying biological processes or systems.
However, due to the relatively high cost and complexity of sample
preparation, the number of samples surveyed in each experiment is
much smaller than the number of features surveyed in each sample.

The key characteristic of such datasets can be summarized as ‘large
17, small 71’ (Fan and Lv, 2010). This presents a tremendous challenge
when conducting statistical inference on these data such as detecting
differentially expressed (DE) genes — a fundamental problem in gene
expression data analysis.

Hierarchical models (Good, 1965), which are designed to ‘bor—
row strength’ across features, provide a solution under the high—
dimensional data setting and have been shown to be effective in
dealing with high—throughput genomics data (Kerr and Churchill,

2001; Newton et (11., 2001; Parmigiani et (11., 2003; Smyth, 2004).
The hierarchical model framework has been increasingly utilized in
genomics research (Ji and Liu, 2010). It is widely accepted that hier—
archical models possess key advantages over naive, separate infer—
ence on individual features. The key idea is that hierarchical models
assume that distribution parameters of all features (e.g. probes) are
random draws from an upper—level prior distribution (hyperprior).
As a result, the posterior distributions of these parameters ‘regress’
toward the middle. Despite its success, such a strategy could be a
double—edged sword. On the one hand, this approach alleviates the
problem of poor inference results due to small sample size; on the
other hand, it inadvertently introduces biases when estimating the
variances of genes that have intrinsic high or intrinsic low variance.
It is a reasonable strategy if no additional information except the
current experimental data is available. However, in reality, given the
explosion of genomics datasets that are publicly available, there is
abundant information that can be utilized and should be considered.
A unique and fundamental advantage of the Bayesian inference
framework lies in its capability to incorporate existing prior infor—
mation. Bayesian inference achieves seamless integration of prior
knowledge and observed data hence is desirable in solving real prac—
tical problems (Gelman, 2004). Because technologies like micro—
array have been widely adopted, there are plenty of publicly
available data (referred to as historical data hereafter). We believe
such information should be taken advantage of, and the Bayesian
framework provides an attractive avenue for implementing such a
strategy. Although historical data have been exploited in other con—
texts (for example, Sui et al. (2009) applied a historical database of
microarray experiments to adjust background for DNA micro—
arrays), we found none of the existing methods for detecting DE
genes explicitly utilizes historical data in a Bayesian setting.

Our hypothesis is that the expression value of each gene (or its
surrogate — probe on the microarray) has its unique distribution
which reflects its intrinsic biological properties. For example, when
historical data collected under diverse conditions were aggregated
together, compounded with limited signal range of the microarray
technology, measurements of house—keeping genes tend to show
high means but relatively small variances across conditions; whereas
genes responding to stimuli tend to have large variances since their
expression values can go either way. Therefore, assuming proper
normalization has been performed across samples, to perform statis—
tical inference, we believe it is perhaps a better strategy to use data
that are collected from different experiments but the same gene,
than data collected from the same experiment but different genes.
To illustrate the point, using 566 normal solid tissue microarray
datasets obtained by Affymetrix GeneChip U133A from the global
gene expression map of microarray data built by Lukk et al. (2010)
(details about the datasets can be found in the Results section), we
plot standard deviation versus mean on 22 283 probes of their nor—
malized and log—transformed expression values (Fig. 1). We observe
a crescent shape in the plot, probes with low or high means tend to
have small variance (measured by standard deviation in figures and
tables), while probes with mid—level means tend to have large vari—
ance. We choose 100 probes from each of the three spots that corres—
pond to low mean/small variance, mid—level mean/large variance
and high mean/small variance, respectively, and perform a Gene
Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et (11., 2000) enrichment analysis on
each set of the corresponding genes using DAVID (Huang da et (11.,
2009a,b). More Details can be found in the Supplementary Tables
S1—S3 and Figure S1. The result appears to support our hypothesis.
We find that the genes in Group 3 are mostly involved in housekeep—
ing activities evidenced by enriched functional categories such as

mostly known for being responsive to stimuli. Genes in Group 1
show no functional enrichment, perhaps because they are barely
expressed.

2 Methods

2.1 Problem setup

In an experiment to identify DE genes, the goal is to detect, among
all the genes tested (often in the tens of thousands), the ones that
show statistical significant difference in their expression measures
between two conditions. For each individual gene, this is a hypoth—
esis testing problem. In a typical study using microarray or other
high throughput technologies, the sample size (i.e. number of repli—
cates) is often extremely small, which presents a significant chal—
lenge for testing due to unreliable variance estimates. To overcome
this, various methods have been proposed in the literature, aiming
to obtain more robust variance estimates. For example, SAM
(Tusher et (11., 2001) proposed to add a small constant to stabilize
variance estimation when performing Student’s t—test. A Bayesian
hierarchical model provides an alternative approach by borrowing
information from other genes to stabilize estimated variances. In
this approach, the variance estimate for each gene can be regarded
as the weighted average of the sample variance of this gene and the
overall sample variance across all genes. The underlying assumption
is that all genes share some commonalities, so much so that the par—
ameters of the prior distributions (of the model parameters) can be
regarded as random samples drawn from another distribution
(hyper—prior). Such an approach has been widely adopted to analyze
microarray gene expression data and other high—throughput gen—
omics data. As an example, Limma is an empirical Bayesian method,
which utilizes a hierarchical model to borrow information from

B.Li et al.

 

other genes so that the resulting estimate of variance can be im—
proved (Smyth, 2004).

2.2 Basic statistical framework

Let Xiik denotes the log—transformed gene expression value after ap—
propriate preprocessing and normalization, where i denotes the gene
(or probe), / denotes the condition (control group or treatment
group) and [2 denotes the replicate with 1'21, 2,...,I, [:1, 2
and k: 1, 2,. . ., n. The basic assumption for the gene expression
value is:

Xijklﬂij:  N N(.ui,i7  (1)
where )1,”- denotes the mean for the ith gene in the jth group and 
is the variance for the ith gene. We test whether the mean expression
for a certain gene is significantly different between the two groups.
For the ith gene, the hypotheses are: Ho : um : um versus
HA2 Hi,1$£ MLZ'

In a typical hierarchical model designed for analyzing microarray
data, the probability models for gene expression values under the
two conditions can be written as follows (Note that the following
models are adapted from the ones originally proposed by Ji and
Wong (2005) for modeling tiling array data):

Xijklﬂijaazg N N(Mi,/a‘7g) (2)
iii/Wng {x 1 (3)
ﬁll/0,60% ~ InV- 280107603) (4)

where the mean parameter m,- is assumed to be uniform and variance

parameter a? is assumed to follow an inverse—;(2 distribution with
hyper—parameters yo and 60%. An empirical Bayes shrinkage estimator
for a? is then used as the variance estimator of, which is subse—

quently used to perform an adjusted t—test.

2.3 Informative prior Bayesian test (IPBT)

In this study, we propose an alternative approach, which is in some
sense ‘perpendicular’ to the Bayesian hierarchal model for detecting
DE genes. Instead of borrowing information from different genes
measured in the same experiment, our proposed approach borrows
information from the measurements of the same gene in different ex—
periments conducted in the past, using the same technology, same
type of chip, on the same type of cells (or similar). The idea of utiliz—
ing past experience can be readily achieved under a Bayesian infer—
ence framework in the form of prior distributions.

The key idea of our approach is to specify an informative, gene—
specific prior distribution for each gene based on abundant histor—
ical data and then conduct Bayesian hypothesis testing. Hence, we
name our approach informative prior Bayesian test (IPBT). Because
different genes have different biological functions, it is often the case
that their expression quantities display rather diverse distributions.
Therefore, in contrast to the Bayesian hierarchical model, IPBT as—
sumes that each gene has its own unique prior distributions.

2.3. 1 IPBT model

Ugh/“co? ~ Inv — foam?) (7)
where (um/2,) and (11,-, co?) are the hyper—parameters. The main dif—
ference between IPBT and the hierarchical model in (2)—(4) is that
here hyper parameters (11,-, co?) for the variance 0,25 are gene—specific.
This gives each gene its specific prior distribution and allows more
ﬂexibility. Supplementary Figure S2 in the Supplementary Materials
summarizes the difference between IPBT and the Bayesian hierarch—
ical model. In IPBT, for each gene, the parameter of interest is  for
which we infer using a Bayesian procedure. Details about the model
and its inference procedure can be found in the Supplementary
Materials (Section 2.1).

2.3.2. Inference and computation

Substantial amount of microarray data have been accumulated in
public repositories such as gene expression omnibus (GEO) and
ArrayExpress. Using such historical data, we can obtain gene—
specific and informative prior distributions for most of the cell types
studied.

Applying IPBT, we perform statistical hypothesis testing to de—
tect DE genes in the form of Student’s t—test (with adjusted variance
estimates) to allow a direct and fair performance comparison with
other existing methods. The test statistics is:

t: Z 11 12 
A2
, . 2) w:

 

where in and Z; are sample means for control and treatment
group, respectively.  and are estimates of the posterior distribu—
tion parameters.

The adjusted variance estimate is essentially the weighted aver—
age of the estimated variances obtained from historical data and cur—
rent data, respectively. This indicates that IPBT indeed enables
natural integration of historical data into the current experiment to
assist in DE gene detection. Because we choose conjugate priors (i.e.
normal inverse—x2 distributions) in IPBT, the posterior distribution
can be directly estimated. More details can be found in Section 2.1
of the Supplementary Materials. We show that using adjusted t—test
is equivalent to using Bayes factor in terms of ranking DE genes in
our model (details can be found in Section 2.2 of the Supplementary
Materials).

3 Results

3.1 Simulation

We conduct a simulation study to compare IPBT with four alterna—
tive methods for detecting DE genes: (i) Student’s t—test, (ii) SAM,
achieved by R package ‘siggenes’; (iii) Limma, achieved by R pack—
age ‘Limma’; and (iv) Z test using the true variance.

3.1.1 Comparison of variance estimation between hierarchical
model and IPBT

To illustrate the impact of different methods on genes’ variance esti—
mation, we conduct the following simulation study. Using the mean
and standard deviation obtained from normal solid tissue samples in
the global gene expression map of microarray data developed by
Lukk et al. (2010), we simulate two samples of expression data and
treat them as current control data. We randomly select ten samples
from normal solid tissue samples and use them as historical data
when estimating standard deviation with IPBT. Figure 2 shows the
plots of standard deviations obtained using various methods versus

caused by limited sample size. Figure 2(c) gives the standard devi—
ations estimated from the Bayesian hierarchical model, which show
shrinkage towards the middle effect compared to Figure 2(b) and
clearly suffer from the over—shrinkage problem. Figure 2(d) shows
the variance estimates from IPBT, which show little over—shrinkage
problem.

3.1.2. Simulation strategy

The simulation study considers 1000 genes and k (ranging from 2 to
5) samples for both the treatment and control groups. We randomly
select 10% of the 1000 genes (i.e. 100 genes) as designated DE
genes. Gene expression values in both the treatment and control
groups are assumed to follow normal distributions. The distribution
parameters are obtained from real data in the global gene expression
map. First, 1000 genes are randomly selected (without replacement)
genome—wide. Then for each gene, we derive its sample mean and
sample variance from the 566 normal samples in the collection. For
the treatment group, the mean and variance of a gene’s expression
value are assumed to be equal to their counterparts in the control
group except for the 100 DE genes for which the mean expression
values are set to be two standard deviations higher. For historical
data used by IPBT, we first randomly select 1 88 normal samples out
of 566 (without replacement) from the global gene expression map,
then obtain their gene expression values corresponding to the 1000
genes selected earlier.

3.1.3. DE gene detection result

To evaluate the performance, we calculate the empirical false discov—
ery rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Tusher et al., 2001)
(also known as false discovery proportion — the proportion of incor—
rect DE calls among all the ones called) from the top 100 genes

detected by IPBT is even smaller than the FDR of DE genes detected
by the Student’s t—test with larger sample size (i.e. increased by one).

We use Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves to fur—
ther compare IPBT with the other methods. Figure 3(c) shows a typ—
ical ROC curve for one single simulation with two replicates.
Detailed area under the curve (AUC) corresponding to Figure 3(c) is
listed in Supplementary Table S7 (‘Random Choice’ column). The
ROC curves again show that IPBT performs better than all the other
methods in detecting DE genes except for the Z test, and the per—
formances of our method and the Z test are similar. More results
can be found in the simulation section of the Supplementary
Materials (Supplementary Fig. S3; Table S6).

We further compare the consistency and stability of these meth—
ods in detecting DE genes. In each simulation, historical data remain
unchanged, but five different sets of the control and treatment data
were generated from the same underlying distributions. For each set
of the control and treatment data, we apply all four methods to de—
tect DE genes. We summarize the number of overlaps among the
five lists of DE genes. The simulation procedure is repeated 500
times, and the average number of overlaps is used as a measure of
consistency in detecting DE genes. We consider an average number
of overlaps greater than or equal to four as an indication of high
consistency and greater than or equal to three as moderate consist—
ency. The average numbers of overlaps are reported in Table 1
which again shows that IPBT outperforms other methods except for
the Z test in consistency, and the performances of IPBT and the Z
test are close.

3.1.4 Impact of inaccurate variance estimation

In the previous simulation study, for each gene, we use the same dis—
tribution to generate current data and historical data. This repre—
sents an idealistic scenario and may not hold true in reality. To
examine the robustness of our method, we conduct an additional
simulation study in which both parameters in the normal distribu—
tion that produces the historical data are shifted such that the distri—
butions that generate historical data and current data are no longer
identical. The amount of shift is randomly drawn from a uniform
distribution in the interval of (—20%, 20%). We investigate three
types of noise—added historical data: unbiased, over—dispersion and
under—dispersion. Supplementary Figure S5 in the Supplementary

Materials shows that IPBT with noisy historical data still outper—
forms other methods. Although the performance of IPBT deterio—
rated when noisy historical data are used, it is still better than
Student’s t—test, SAM and Limma in terms of FDR and is close to the
gold standard Z test result in all scenarios. This result demonstrates
the robustness of IPBT and implies its broad applicability even with
potentially noisy historical data.

3.1.5 Detect DE genes with low intrinsic variance

As Figure 2 demonstrates, Hierarchical model—based methods in—
ﬂate the variance of the genes which have intrinsic low variance
hence lower power to detect DE genes of this kind. IPBT, on the
other hand, does not suffer from this shortcoming. To further in—
vestigate how over—correction affects the detection of DE genes, we
conduct another simulation study under the scenario that the DE
genes have low intrinsic variance, and the results are reported in
Figure 3(b), (d), Supplementary Table S7 (‘Low Variance’ column)
and Table 1 (Low variance). All the results show that Bayesian
hierarchical model performs even worse than Student’s t—test,
whereas IPBT maintains superior performance that is similar to the
performance of the Z test. These results confirm the robustness of
IPBT because it avoids the ‘over—correction’ issues for those genes
with low intrinsic variance. More results can be found in the simu—
lation section of the Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Fig.
S4; Table S6).

3.2 Real data analysis

3.2.1 The global gene expression map

Lukk et al. (2010) built a global gene expression map that includes
microarray data from 5372 human samples and contains 369 differ—
ent tissues, cell lines and disease states. Among them, we calculate
informative priors for 96 groups with at least ten samples including
normal solid brain tissue and normal solid heart tissue. The dataset
(processed and normalized by robust multiarray analysis (RMA)
(Irizarry et al., 2003)) was downloaded from arrayExpress (ID:
E—MTAB—62). The 96 groups have a median sample size of 25.5 and
a mean sample size of 48. More details about the gene expression
map can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

3.2.2 Comparison of current and historical data

Our model assumes that the historical data is informative for esti—
mating gene expression variance. We validate this using two sets of
data from the global gene expression map. One set contains all the
data from heart, and the other one contains all the data from brain.
For each set, we download the raw data (CEL files) and subse—
quently process and normalize the data using RMA (Irizarry et al.,
2003), using R package ‘oligo’. In the first study, we randomly
choose five normal heart samples (out of 36) and five disease heart
samples (out of 51) and use them as the current data. Data from
the 31 remaining normal heart samples are used as historical data.
Figure 4(a) and (b) shows the standard deviations of the genes in
the control group (normal samples) and treatment group (disease
samples) against historical data, respectively. The strong positive
correlation patterns demonstrated in the plot confirm that using
historical information as informative priors in the inference pro—
cedure is feasible. We also conduct similar analyses on the brain
samples. We randomly choose five normal brain samples (out of
39) as controls and five disease brain samples (out of 31) and use
them as the current data. Data from the 34 remaining normal brain
samples are used as historical data. Corresponding results

3.2.3 DE gene detection

For real data, since it is not possible to know what the real DE genes
are, we use agreement as the measurement of performance. This strat—
egy has been commonly used in microarray data analysis studies (Lim
et al., 2015; Lim and Wong, 2014). In this study, again using the glo—
bal gene map data, we randomly select two normal heart samples and
two disease heart samples. Data from the remaining 34 normal heart
samples are used as historical data. We then apply IPBT and compet—
ing methods on these data to obtain a list of top 1000 DE genes for
each method. We repeat the above sampling and testing procedure
five times. Then for each method, we calculate the agreement between
every pair of the 1000 DE gene lists. Figure 4(c) summarizes the re—
sults, which shows significant higher agreement for our IPBT method
compared to others. We also compared the DE gene calling consist—
ency as we did in the simulation study, and the results are summarized
in Supplementary Table S8. Again, IPBT performs the best among all
methods tested. The procedure is repeated for brain data, comparing
two normal brain samples and two disease brain samples. The results
are shown in Supplementary Figure S6 and Table S9. IPBT again
achieves the best agreement and consistency. To get a comprehensive
picture of performance, we also conduct performance comparison on
each of the five testing sets individually. Detailed descriptions of the
study and results are given in the Supplementary Materials (Section
5.2, Supplementary Figure S7—S11).

3.2.4 Latin Square hgu133a Spike-in experiment data

This data set consists of three replicates of 14 separate hybridiza—
tions of 42 spiked transcripts in a complex human background
(HeLa cells) at concentrations ranging from 0.125 to 512 pM
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Since the spike—in genes are known,
this dataset has been widely used in evaluating the performance of

Microarray preprocessing algorithms (McCall et al., 2010; Wu and
Irizarry, 2004) and DE gene analysis methods (Lo and Gottardo,
2007). In our study, each time we select two out of the 14 separate
hybridizations as the control and treatment groups (each group has
three replicates) respectively. All 91 pairs are tested for DE gene de—
tection. After excluding the probes that do not exist in Affymetrix
GeneChip U133A, 34 probes are bona fide differentially expressed
each time. We use 42 datasets from HeLa cells (cervical adenocar—
cinoma cell line) from the global gene expression map as the histor—
ical data.

In this study, each method generates a DE probe list (ranked by
the test statistics) in every pair of the control and treatment
groups and we obtain the proportion of correct DE calls (match the
34 bona fide DE probes). Table 2 summarizes the average
number of correctly identified DE probes among the top [2
(k : 5.10. . . . .40)probes across all 91 control and treatment com—
binations. Figure 5 shows the box plots of FDRs for the top [2 probes
called significant. IPBT consistently detects more bona fide DE
probes hence has a lower FDR in terms of the median across all the
experiments. In addition, IPBT is more robust since it consistently
shows the smallest interquartile ranges in the boxplot. All these re—
sults show that IPBT performs better than other methods.

4 Discussion

In this study, we present a novel strategy of reutilizing relevant in—
formation contained in historical data to improve DE gene detec—
tion. Simulation studies and real data applications show that our
method IPBT significantly outperforms other existing methods in
terms of both accuracy and consistency in detecting DE genes. In
particular, when the DE genes have relatively low intrinsic vari—
ances, methods based on the Bayesian hierarchical models perform
poorly whereas IPBT maintains its superior performance.

Bayesian hierarchical model provides an attractive statistical
framework for handling ‘large 17, small 71’ inference problems.

Because it can ‘borrow’ information from all genes in the genome to
aid the inference on a single gene so that the poor performance due
to limited sample size can be improved. However, as we showed in
this study, the Bayesian hierarchical model approach can suffer from
the ‘over—correction’ problem and produce false negatives. In add—
ition, the empirical Bayesian approach assumes a common prior for
every gene, which will limit the effectiveness of the approach for
genes with dramatically different behaviors. In contrast, IPBT as—
sumes gene—specific, informative priors. With the rapid proliferation
of high—throughput genomics big data, deriving these informative
priors is no longer an issue.

Meta—analysis is a powerful tool for combining multiple studies
of a related hypothesis and has been applied to microarray data
(Conlon et al., 2007; Tseng et al., 2012). Our approach is different
from meta—analysis because historical data used in IPBT may come
from experiments with a different hypothesis, and the historical data
is used indirectly in the form of informative priors in Bayesian
inference.

There is much room for improvement in IPBT. First, the inform—
ative prior used in IPBT is gene—specific so DE gene analysis is done
gene—by—gene. In reality we know some genes are correlated with
each other such as genes located in the same pathway or sharing
similar biological functions. A potential extension of IPBT is to
introduce correlation among genes. Correlation information can be
derived from biological knowledge or historical data. Recent studies
have demonstrated the benefit of incorporating correlation informa—
tion in the inference of DE genes (Lim and Wong, 2014; Soh et al.,
2011).

Second, the current IPBT method uses normal distribution to
model log transformed expression measures. The distribution choice
is made mainly for mathematical convenience. One can replace nor—
mal distribution with other non—normal ones to achieve robustness
in inference in the same way as Ganjali et al. (2015) have done in
their study of DE gene detection.

Third, we assume the expression values used by IPBT have al—
ready been background—corrected and normalized. This is possible
with the powerful normalization techniques such as RMA. It is how—
ever, desirable if additional consideration is factored in the model to
account for subtle experiment—to—experiment biases in the data as
shown in studies such as Arima et al. (2011) and Lewin et al.
(2006). This will potentially make IPBT more ﬂexible and further
improve its performance.

We are planning to pursue such extensions to IPBT in future fol—
low—up studies.

5 Conclusions

In this study, we investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of deriv—
ing informative priors from historical microarray data and using
them to help detect DE genes in studies with limited sample size.
Through simulation and real data analysis, we show that our
method significantly outperforms competing methods including the
popular and state—of—the—art Bayesian hierarchical model—based
approaches.

Taking advantage of the resource of global gene expression map
developed by Lukk et al. (2010), we have calculated informative pri—
ors for 96 different groups of cell types using the Affymetrix U133A
GeneChip as a community resource for DE gene study (all groups
in the global gene expression map with at least 10 samples).
We made the calculated informative priors freely available for the
research community, which can be downloaded from https://github.
com/benliemory/IPBT.

The strategy we propose in this paper is not limited to the micro—
array platform. RNA—Seq (Mortazavi et al., 2008) is considered a
better alternative for measuring gene expression because it can pro—
vide more information about the transcriptome (alternative splicing,
gene fusion, etc.). We did not use RNA—Seq data since currently
much less ‘historical’ data is available compared to microarray, due
to the comparatively higher cost and shorter time of the adoption of
RNA—Seq. As the total volume of RNA—Seq data increases, the IPBT
framework can be applied to RNA—Seq as well. Cross—platform
models may also be considered.

Our work illustrates the feasibility and benefits of exploiting the in—
creasingly available genomics big data in statistical inference and pre—
sents a promising strategy for dealing with the ‘large 17, small n’
problem.

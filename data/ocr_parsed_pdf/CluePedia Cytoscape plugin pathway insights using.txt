ABSTRACT

Summary: The CluePedia Cytoscape plugin is a search tool for new
markers potentially associated to pathways. CluePedia calculates
linear and non-linear statistical dependencies from experimental
data. Genes, proteins and miRNAs can be connected based on in
silico and/or experimental information and integrated into a ClueGO
network of terms/pathways. Interrelations within each pathway can be
investigated, and new potential associations may be revealed through
gene/protein/miRNA enrichments. A pathway-like visualization can be
created using the Cerebral plugin layout. Combining all these features
is essential for data interpretation and the generation of new hypoth-
eses. The CluePedia Cytoscape plugin is user-friendly and has an
expressive and intuitive visualization.

Availability: http://www.ici.upmc.fr/cluepedia/ and via the Cytoscape
plugin manager. The user manual is available at the CluePedia
website.

1 INTRODUCTION

Integrating heterogeneous expression data and functional
network information is essential for understanding cellular pro-
cesses and their dynamics. Within the versatile framework of
Cytoscape (Saito et al., 2012; Shannon et al., 2003), tools for
ontology analysis (Bindea et al., 2009) and gene function predic-
tions (Montojo et al., 2010) were developed. CluePedia provides
a comprehensive View on a pathway or process by investigating
experimental and in silico data from different perspectives: gene
interrelations, miRNAs regulatory aspects, proteiniprotein inter-
actions, as well as the functional context, in conjunction with
ClueGO (Bindea et al., 2009).

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Data sources, import and update

The user can analyze his/her own experimental data and directly
compare and enrich it with publicly available information from

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2011), IntAct (Kerrien et al., 2012),
MiMI (Tarcea et al., 2009), miRBase (Kozomara and
Grifﬁths-Jones, 2011) and miRecords (Xiao et al., 2009). The
pathway analysis is based on GO (Ashburner et al., 2000),
KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2002), Reactome (Croft et al., 2011)
and other resources (Supplementary Material).

Sets of identiﬁers of interest can be directly uploaded in text
format, pasted in a text field or interactively derived from gene
networks. The plugin automatically recognizes a variety of iden-
tiﬁers for genes, proteins or miRNAs that can be updated with
the latest NCBI information.

CluePedia comes with human and mouse interaction data.
New pre-compiled files as well as data for >20 other organisms
can be automatically downloaded after the installation. The
plugin is easily extendable for additional organisms and identi-
ﬁers in a plugin-like manner.

2.2 Pathway interactions from custom and in silica data

CluePedia calculates statistical dependencies (correlation) for
markers of interest from experimental data. Four tests for inves-
tigating linear and non-linear dependencies between variables are
implemented: Pearson correlation, Spearman’s rank, Distance
correlation (Szekely and Rizzo, 2009) and the recently described
Maximal Information Coefﬁcient (MIC) (Reshef et al., 2011).
These tests can be applied simultaneously or individually to ana-
lyze whole-input ﬁle (e. g. Affymetrix datasets), selected markers
versus the entire dataset or among selected markers only. The
resulting ﬁle is added to CluePedia as an additional resource for
further analysis.

Experimental data can be normalized and Visualized next to
the nodes using adjustable thresholds. Filter methods based on
the expression level, standard deviation and the number of miss-
ing values are available. Another feature allows the extraction of
a subset of expression data corresponding to a pathway or term,
from a dataset into a new ﬁle.

2.3 Enrichment of pathways

CluePedia Visualizes custom correlation weights as well as known
interaction and miRNA-binding scores as edges on the network.

The network can be enriched with markers with the highest
interaction score for all or each of the selected nodes.
Furthermore, the network can be enriched with hub markers
that have the highest connectivity with all selected nodes.
Different edge score types can be used together for the

normal colon mucosa and colorectal tumors and in silico information. (a)
Functionally grouped network with pathways and genes. Terms are
linked based on K score (30.3). Edges show known activation (green),
expression (yellow), post-translational modiﬁcation (pink) and binding
(blue). The edge thickness is scaled between the minimum and maximum
scores shown. Terms and their associated genes share the color.
‘Regulation of IFNG signaling’ pathway is investigated in a subnetwork.
(b) Genes not included in the initial selection are colored in white. Known
interactions are shown. (c) Gene interrelations in normal samples are
shown as Pearson correlation (blue) and MIC (orange), all values >0.7.
Normalized expression data from five normal colon samples are shown as
node label for IFNGRl and IFNGR2. All spots corresponding to a gene
are shown. ((1) Pathway-like View of the network showing cellular loca-
tions. (e) ‘Regulation of IFNG signaling’ after enrichment steps. Five

tions are shown as sinusoidal lines

enrichment, and the network will be updated with the speciﬁed
number of top scored interactions meeting all threshold criteria.
Customizable ﬁlters allow the Visualization of highest common/
speciﬁc interaction scores within the data sources selected.
The user can easily modify the action type displayed (e.g. acti-
vation, inhibition), as well as the color of nodes and edges.

Importantly, this enrichment can be used within ClueGO net-
works of pathways. Newly enriched genes already known to be
associated with a pathway will be automatically linked to it.
Another original feature of CluePedia expands ClueGO terms
into nested networks. Like this, a pathway can be investigated
in detail to reveal how known gene interrelations are modulated
within the experimental context used, and which could be the
newly associated genes/miRNAs.

CluePedia automatically extracts the cellular location of mar-
kers from GO terms and maps it on pre-defined cellular com-
partments. Based on this information, a pathway-like View can
be created using the Cerebral plugin layout (Barsky et al., 2007).
If for some markers no cellular location is found, they will be
placed into a ‘no annotation found’ layer. The provided cellular
compartments can be easily modified and extended by the user.
The network and the pathway Views can easily be switched.

3 CASE STUDY

T helper l-related genes (Mlecnik et al., 2010) and their corres-
ponding pathways are simultaneously Visualized in a CluePedia
network (Fig. 1a). The ‘Regulation of IFNG signaling’ pathway
is investigated as a nested network. In silico interactions within
the pathway (Fig. 1b) can be compared with linear and non-
linear interrelations derived from expression data from normal
colon and colon tumors [E-MTAB-57 (Ancona et al., 2006),
E-GEOD-37892, ArrayExpress (Parkinson et al., 2011)].
Normalized gene expression data are Visualized next to the
node (Fig. 1c). The network can be switched to a pathway-like
View (Fig. 1d), displaying the cellular location of genes. The
pathway is enriched with correlating genes from normal and
tumor data as well as with predicted miRNAs that could play
a crucial role in modulating interferon gamma (IFNG) signaling
regulation (Fig. 1e).

4 SUMMARY

CluePedia allows a fast comparison of known and experimen-
tally derived interrelation information. New gene/miRNA asso-
ciations specific for the experimental context can be uncovered
through enrichments and integrated into ClueGO networks of
pathways. With CluePedia, the user can create a custom encyclo-
pedia of interrelation sets. CluePedia Cytoscape plugin is freely
available at http://www.ici.upmc.fr/cluepedia/ and Via the
Cytoscape plugin manager.

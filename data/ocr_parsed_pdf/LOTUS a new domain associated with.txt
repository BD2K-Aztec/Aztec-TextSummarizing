ABSTRACT

We describe here LOTUS, a hitherto uncharacterized small globular
domain, which was identified using sensitive sequence profile
analysis. The LOTUS domain is found in germline-specific proteins
that are present in the nuage/polar granules of germ cells. TDRD5
and TDRD7, two mammalian members of the germline Tudor group,
possess three copies of the LOTUS domain in their extreme N-
termini. The Tudor domains of these proteins bind symmetric
dimethyl arginines present on the germ cell-specific Piwi proteins,
which form a particular clade of Argonaute proteins. Piwi proteins
interact with a specific class of non-coding RNAs [piwi-interacting
RNAs (piRNAs)] and play a key role in the repression (silencing)
of transposons and possibly other germline-specific functions.
A LOTUS domain is also present in the Oskar protein, a critical
component of the pole plasm in the Drosophila oocyte, which is
required for germ cell formation. LOTUS domains are found in various
proteins from metazoans and plants, are often associated with RNA-
specific modules and are likely to adopt a winged helix fold. This
suggests a germline-specific role in the mRNA localization and/or
translation or a specific function toward piRNAs.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Tudor domain, the name of which originates from its
identiﬁcation in the Drosophila Tudor protein (Callebaut and
Momon, 1997; Ponting, 1997), is a small domain belonging to the
large ‘Royal Family’ that also includes Chromo, MBT, PWWP and
plant Agenet domains (Maurer-Stroh et (11., 2003). Tudor domains
are specialized in the speciﬁc recognition of methylated lysine or
methylated arginine sites, and are involved in various epigenetic
functions, such as chromatin remodeling and RNA processing.
Based on their sequences and functions, four groups of Tudor
domains were recently distinguished (Jin et (11., 2009). The ﬁrst
group, including the JMDJ family of histone demethylases, as well as
the related 53BP1 and Crb2 proteins, participates in the histone code
deciphering, as their tandems of Tudor domains bind methylated

lysines of histone tails (Botuyan et (11., 2006; Huang et (11., 2006).
Binding of symmetrically dimethylated arginines (sDMAs) is a
property shared by the two following groups that include proteins
involved in the RNA metabolism (Cote and Richard, 2005; Friberg
et (11., 2009). The second group includes the Tudor domain of the
SMN protein (the product of the survival of motor neuron gene),
which interacts with the spliceosomal Sm proteins and regulates
the mRNA splicing machinery (Selenko et (11., 2001). The third
group, typiﬁed by the Tudor domain of SNDl (also called Tudor-
SN or p100), a component of the RNA-induced silencing complex,
is involved in the processing of small non-coding RNAs (Caudy
et (11., 2003). The fourth group contrasts with the others that include
widely expressed proteins. It contains proteins highly enriched or
selectively expressed in germ cells and involved in the formation of
polar/germinal granules or nuage, those electron-dense organelles,
abundant in RNA and proteins and Characteristic of the germline
in many organisms. These proteins are crucial for spermatogenesis
and small RNA pathways (Chuma et (11., 2006; Vasileva et (11.,
2009). Several recent studies showed that the Tudor domains of
proteins of this group, called the germline Tudor proteins, bind
sDMAs present on the germ cell-speciﬁc Piwi proteins. These last
proteins form a particular clade of Argonaute proteins, interacting
with a speciﬁc class of non-coding RNAs [piwi-interacting RNAs
(piRNAs)]. piRNAs—Piwi complexes are likely to have diverse
roles in the germline (Chen et (11., 2009; Kirino et (11., 2010;
Nishida et (11., 2009; Vagin et (11., 2009b; Wang et (11., 2009).
They function in gene silencing, probably through a mechanism
analogous to RNA interference by inducing the Cleavage of gene
transcripts [transposon silencing (Saito et (11., 2006)] or directly at
the transcriptional level (Yin and Lin, 2007). Moreover, they were
shown in Drosophila to regulate mRNA stability and translation,
a ﬁinction which thereby contrasts with the only negative effect
of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and micro-RNAs (miRNAs)
(Li, 2007). Arginine methylation of Piwis and interaction with
Tudors seems to be a conserved feature of the Piwi pathway that
distinguishes it from the somatic Ago pathway [the other clade
of Argonaute proteins that bind to miRNAs and small interfering
RNA (siRNA) and are ubiquitously expressed]. Thus, this speciﬁc
interaction could be required for Piwi recruitment to nuage granules
(Vagin et (11., 2009a), and germline Tudor proteins might provide
the platform necessary for assembly of numerous proteins that
function as a complex in the Piwi pathway (Vagin et (11., 2009a).
This pathway is essential, in Drosophila, for germ cell determination
and maintenance of germline stem cells and, in mice, for postnatal
spermatogenesis [reviewed in Chuma et (11. (2009)].

LOTUS

 

In a survey of Tudor domain-containing proteins, we focused on
these germline Tudor proteins. We identiﬁed multiple copies of a
new domain in some mammalian members (TDRD5 and TDRD7),
which is also present in other proteins with different domain
architectures. We thus describe here this short, novel domain, that
we called LOTUS (after Limkain, Oskar and TUdor-containing
proteins 5 and 7).

2 METHODS

The PSI-BLAST program (BLAST 2.2.22+. default parameters) (Altschul
et (11.. 1997) was used to search for similarities against the non-redundant
database (nr database; January 2010. 10 381 056 sequences) at NCBI (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). The E-Value threshold was 0.005 for inclusion
of sequences into a proﬁle. Sequences were clustered with BLASTCLUST
followed by manual sorting. Low sequence identity and length coverage
threshold values were used in order to deﬁne only a few numbers of clusters.
from which representative sequences were used as queries for further PSI-
BLAST iterations.

Hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) was used to predict the position of
globular domains in protein sequences. as well as to reﬁne and extend the
sequence alignments. as reported in the PSI-BLASTresults. Guidelines to the
use of this methodology can be found in (Callebaut et (11.. 1997; Eudes et (11..
2007). The Smart (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/; Letunic et (11.. 2009)
and Pfam (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/; Finn et (11.. 2010) domain databases.
as well as the CDD collection (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/
wrpsb.cgi; Marchler-Bauer et (11.. 2009) were searched using HMMSearch
and RPS-BLAST. respectively. using default threshold values (e.g. for Pfam
search; E-Value = 0.1). Higher E-Values were also considered in order not to
miss potential interesting similarities. which could be further explored.

Multiple alignment of the selected sequences was constructed using
MAFFT (Katoh and Toh. 2008). and manually adjusted with guidance from
HCA. This multiple alignment was considered to predict protein secondary
structures using J PRED (http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-jpred/)
(Cole et (11.. 2008) and PSI-FRED (http://bioinf4.cs.ucl.ac.uk:3000/psipred)
(McGufﬁn et (11.. 2000). and to perform fold recognition using Phyre
(http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre/) (Bennett-Lovsey et (11.. 2008) or
other methods. such as HHPred (deing at (11.. 2005) and MUSTER
(http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/MUSTER/) (Wu and Zhang. 2008).
It was also used in additional searches using the HMMER3 package (Eddy.
2008) with default parameters. on the Mobyle system (http://mobyle.pasteur
.fr) (Néron et (11.. 2009).

3 RESULTS

Examination of the sequences of various members of the germline
Tudor proteins (called TDRDs) shows that globular region(s) are
present upstream of the repeated Tudor domains. Of note, in the
TDRD5 and TDRD7 proteins, a long stretch of ~400 amino acids
is present at the extreme N-terminus and should include globular
domain(s), as predicted from the analysis of HCA plots (see
Supplementary Material 1). Indeed, this region includes fragments
containing approximately one-third of strong hydrophobic amino
acids gathered into clusters typical of regular secondary structures.
However, it does not match any known proﬁles in the domain
databases. Clear hinge regions can be predicted on these plots,
corresponding to proline-rich regions and/or regions containing less
hydrophobic amino acids (arrows in Supplementary Material 1;
TDRD7: approximately amino acids 100—160 and 315—335;
TDRD5: approximately amino acids 100—130 and 225—255), and
which are far less conserved when comparing the TDRD5 and
TDRD7 sequences. This suggests the presence of three separate

globular domains in TDRD5 and TDRD7 (see Supplementary
Material 1; TDRD7 domain 1: amino acid 1 to approximately 100
or 115, domain 2: amino acids 160—3 15 and domain 3: amino acids
335—420; TDRD5 domain 1: amino acid 1 to approximately 100,
domain 2: amino acids 130—225 and domain 3: amino acids
255—410). We then performed PSI-BLAST searches against the
nr database, using the ﬁrst predicted domain of TDRD7 as query
(ending either at amino acid 100 or amino acid 115). The ﬁrst
iteration identiﬁed similarities of TDRD7 with the TDRD5 ﬁrst
domain, while subsequent iterations identiﬁed, with signiﬁcant
E-values (E < 0.005), similarities with the Drosophila Oskar
protein (second iteration, E :7 ><10_7) and with various other
uncharacterized proteins, several of which possess RNA-binding
domains (e.g. K homology (KH) domain-containing protein from
Cryptosporidium muris, ninth iteration; E = 0.003). Multiple copies
of this domain were also found in limkain b1, a human autoantigen
whose ﬁinction and partners have not been reported to date (Dunster
et (11., 2005). This domain was also found in a hypothetical orphan
protein (D1081.7) from Caenorhabditis elegans, which apparently
does not possess Tudor domains, but is reported in the STRING
database (Jensen et (11., 2009) to be co-expressed with the germ
cell-expressed R06C7.1 protein, a member of the Argonaute family.
In this way, by convergence (iteration 14), we collected ~300
sequences of proteins possessing this domain, called LOTUS after
the name of some representative members (Limkain, Oskar and
TUdor-containing proteins 5 and 7). The LOTUS domain is present
in various proteins of metazoans (including echinoderms, arthropods
and nematodes) and plants (see Fig. 1 for the architecture in domains
of main representative members of the LOTUS family).

The amino acid conservation proﬁle of the LOTUS domain
allowed the more precise prediction of its C-terminal end, deﬁned
at amino acid 96 of human TDRD7 and amino acid 100 of
human TDRD5. Moreover and interestingly, along the PSI-BLAST
iterations, a triplication of the LOTUS domain was highlighted in
the N-terminus of the TDRD5 and TDRD7 proteins, covering the
three domains described above [e.g. match with mouse TDRD5
amino acids 1—99 (30% identity; E-value=5 x 10—21), amino
acids 293—367 (17% identity; E-value=4 X 10—5) and amino acids
130—197 (17% identity; E-value=1 X 10—3)]. These repeats were
further assessed at the 2D level, using HCA (see Supplementary
Material 1). A more precise analysis of the LOTUS repeats in these
proteins suggests that domains 1 and 2 of TDRD7 are homologous
to domains 1 and 3 of TDRD5, the third domain of TDRD7 and the
second one of TDRD5 likely resulting from a later duplication event.
Additional hits were identiﬁed by searching the nr database using
PSI-BLAST and representative members of the LOTUS family as
queries, as well as the second and third LOTUS domain of the
TDRD7 protein. A few borderline similarities [E-values >0.001; for
example, Oryza sativa RSSG8 (UniProt Q94CF9_ORYSA) or other
uncharacterized proteins from plants] were also conﬁrmed through
reciprocal PSI-BLAST searches.

Multiple alignment of the LOTUS domain was made, on the
basis of the PSI-BLAST alignments and manually reﬁned with
guidance from HCA, which combines comparison of the primary
and secondary structures (Fig. 2; Supplementary Material 1).
Additional searches were also performed using this multiple
alignment with HMMSEARCH, and these led to recover a few new,
but also uncharacterized proteins (e.g. LRR2_PLAFA, containing
one LOTUS domain between amino acids 1265 and 1360; see

Oskar protein. although not reported in the domain databases.

Supplementary Material 2 for a complete list). Conserved positions
within the alignment are principally occupied by strong hydrophobic
amino acids that should correspond to core-forming residues (Fig. 2).
Outside these, only a few other positions are more conserved,
occupied by proline or glycine residues (in loops) or by an aromatic
residue (in helix 012). This one might play a role in the interaction of
the LOTUS domain with its patmer(s). The LOTUS globular domain
is predicted to contain three main helices (011 to 013), followed by
two B-strands (01 and 02) (Fig. 2). Two additional small B-strands
may be suspected on the basis of the HCA plot analysis (see 0’
and B” in Supplementary Material 1 and Fig. 2). Two additional
hydrophobic clusters, which would be important for correct folding,
are also present at the N-terminal and C-terminal limits of the
LOTUS domain (0N and ac, e.g. in the C-terminus of human
TDRD7 LOTUS domain a and b, as well in the in the C-terminus of
Drosophila Oskar LOTUS domain, see Supplementary Material 1).
However, these are not very conserved and the ac Cluster is even
absent in some sequences, as for instance in the limkain bl repeats or
in the second LOTUS domain of the uncharacterized protein from
Pichia silchensis (B8LKC8) (Fig. 2). Fold recognition programs,
such as Phyre, indicate marginal but interesting similarities with
several families within the winged helix superfamily [SCOP a.4.5;
e.g. with the Sch winged helix domain (WHD, pdb lt6s) (Kim
el a1., 2006, 2008); E-value 5.2]. These similarities are supported by
a perfect correspondence between secondary structures, suggesting
that the LOTUS domain may actually adopt a WHD fold, also made
of three consecutive a helices and a small two-stranded B-sheet.
The additional small 0’ strand predicted in the LOTUS domain
may integrate this B-sheet, as observed in the Sch WHD2 (see
Supplementary Material 3). Of note is that the last helix (014) found
in the Sch WHDs after the two-stranded B-sheet consists of a
linker region that does not directly participate in the WHD core
(see Supplementary Material 3). The variability or even absence of
this helix (called ac) in some LOTUS domains is thus consistent

with its particular, non-core-forming role in the Sch structure, and
suggests that helix etc may also play a linker role in proteins of the
LOTUS family.

4 DISCUSSION

Various mammalian TDRD proteins have been reported to interact
with Piwi proteins (Chen el a1., 2009; Vagin el a1., 2009b; Wang
el a1., 2009). The LOTUS domain described here is, however, unique
to the TDRD5 and TDRD7 proteins. Although having repeats of
Tudor domains, the other TDRDs indeed differ in their extreme
N-termini, which include either MYND domain (TDRDl), KH
domains (TDRD2) or helicase domain (TDRD9). TDRD7 interacts
more speciﬁcally with Miwi through its Tudor domains (Chen
el a1., 2009; Vagin el a1., 2009b). In Drosophila, Aubergine (Aub)
and AGO3, two members of the Piwi family, interact with the
Tudor protein (Kirino el a1., 2010; Nishida el a1., 2009), which
has apparently no LOTUS domain in its N-terminal fragment. We,
however, show here that a LOTUS domain is found in the Drosophila
Oskar protein, whose localized activity (through mRNA localization
and subsequent synthesis) in the nuage at the posterior pole of the
oocyte, termed germ or pole plasm, induces germline formation and
correct patterning in the ﬂy embryo (Ephrussi and Lehmann, 1992;
Ephrussi el a1., 1991; Kim-Ha el a1., 1991; Lehmann and Nusslein-
Volhard, 1986). The localized Oskar protein has a critical function
in the biogenesis of polar granules (Lehmann and Nusslein-Volhard,
1986) and recruits downstream components of the pole plasm, such
as Vasa and Tudor proteins (Mahowald, 2001). It is interesting to
note that, while many of the Drosophila germplasm components
are conserved and play an essential role in mammalian germ cell
formation as well (reviewed in Chuma el a1., 2009), the key factor in
Drosophila, Oskar, has no known orthologs in any other species. The
results reported here show that the LOTUS domain is a conserved
feature of the protein complexes present in the Piwi-containing

Fig. 2. Multiple sequence alignment of LOTUS domains from various proteins. Positions where hydrophobicity is conserved, which should participate in the

protein core structure, are boxed and shaded gray. Other striking identities (involving glycine and proline residues) are boxed. Predicted secondary structures
are reported up to the alignment. Note that the helix ac is poorly conserved and does not exist in some of the sequences. The star indicates the protein end. The

protein sequences are designated by their UniProt identiﬁers, and the limits (amino acid numbers) of the LOTUS domains in these sequences are reported.
Note that the C-terminal end of the domain is difﬁcult to predict with accuracy, due to the extreme variability in this region. The FASTA-formatted ﬁle of this
alignment is given in the Supplementary Material 4. This ﬁgure was drawn using ESPript (http://espript.ibcp.fr/).

germline-speciﬁc granules in different organisms. LOTUS domains
are indeed present, in mice, in germline TDRDs and in Drosophila,
in the long and short isoforms of Oskar that directly interact with
the Tudor protein. In that respect, TDRD5 and/or TDRD7 might
represent, at least in part, the functional homolog of Oskar in
mammals.

The exact molecular role of the LOTUS domain remains to be
discovered. Its occurrence in proteins having domains associated
with RNA metabolism (RNA recognition motif and KH domains)
suggests that it might be involved in a RNA-binding function.
This hypothesis is supported by the presence of several basic
residues, as well as fold recognition programs, which indicate
that the LOTUS domain may adopt a WHD fold. Possible RNA
partners are piRNAs brought by the TDRD5/7—Piwi complexes or
the numerous mRNA present in the nuage granules. The RNA-
binding ﬁinction might then be involved in the regulation of mRNA
translation and/or localization or of a speciﬁc function in which
piRNAs participate.

The identiﬁcation of this new domain in the mouse germline Tudor
proteins, TDRD5 and TDRD7, and in the Drosophila Oskar protein
should help to understand the function of these proteins in the piRNA
pathways and germline determination, as well as to uncover the
ﬁinction of as yet uncharacterized proteins in this context.

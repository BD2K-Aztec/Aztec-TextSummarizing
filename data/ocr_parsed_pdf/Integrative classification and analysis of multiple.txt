ABSTRACT

Motivation: Array comparative genomic hybridization (arrayCGH) is
widely used to measure DNA copy numbers in cancer research.
ArrayCGH data report log-ratio intensities of thousands of probes
sampled along the chromosomes. Typically, the choices of the
locations and the lengths of the probes vary in different experiments.
This discrepancy in choosing probes poses a challenge in integrated
classification or analysis across multiple arrayCGH datasets. We
propose an alignment-based framework to integrate arrayCGH
samples generated from different probe sets. The alignment
framework seeks an optimal alignment between the probe series
of one arrayCGH sample and the probe series of another sample,
intended to find the maximum possible overlap of DNA copy number
variations between the two measured chromosomes. An alignment
kernel is introduced for integrative patient sample classification and
a multiple alignment algorithm is also introduced for identifying
common regions with copy number aberrations.

Results: The probe alignment kernel and the MPA algorithm were
experimented to integrate three bladder cancer datasets as well
as artificial datasets. In the experiments, by integrating arrayCGH
samples from multiple datasets, the probe alignment kernel used
with support vector machines significantly improved patient sample
classification accuracy over other baseline kernels. The experiments
also demonstrated that the multiple probe alignment (MPA) algorithm
can find common DNA aberrations that cannot be identified with the
standard interpolation method. Furthermore, the MPA algorithm also
identified many known bladder cancer DNA aberrations containing
four known bladder cancer genes, three of which cannot be detected
by interpolation.

1 INTRODUCTION

It has been conﬁrmed in many recent studies that aberrations
in chromosome copy number, rearrangement and structures have
association with the disease (Feuk et al., 2006). Among these
chromosomal aberrations, DNA copy number variations (CNVs),
the events of ampliﬁcation or deletion of a large DNA segment
on chromosomes, are believed to play an important role in

tumorigenesis (Redon et (11., 2006; Shlien and Malkin, 2009).
Chromosome CNVs can be measured by comparative genomic
hybridization (CGH), which compares the copy number of
a differentially labeled case sample with a reference DNA from a
normal individual. ArrayCGH technology based on DNA microarray
can currently allow genome-wide identiﬁcation of regions with
CNVs at different resolutions (Carter, 2007). The arrayCGH data
was used to discriminate healthy patients from cancer patients and
classify patients of different cancer subtypes. Thus, arrayCGH data
is considered as a new source of biomarkers that provide important
information of candidate cancer loci for the classiﬁcation of patients
and discovery of molecular mechanisms of cancers (Sykes et al.,
2009).

ArrayCGH allows rapid mapping of DNA CNVs of a tumor
sample by a locus-by-locus measure. In an arrayCGH experiment,
probes (short DNA segments on chromosomes) of different lengths
and locations are chosen for comparative genomic hybridization.
The CNV information at a probe location is reported by the log-ratio
of the probe intensity between a case and a reference. The sizes and
the number of the probe determines the resolution of an arrayCGH
experiment. The length of the DNA probes used by current platforms
ranges from 100bp to Skb, and in a typical study, the number
of probes ranges from several hundreds to tens of thousands. For
example, a Human array 2.0 chromium surface array can consist of
only 2464 probes at 1.5 Mb resolution, whereas a high-resolution
tiling array provides measurements of 36 288 probes.

The large difference in the sizes and numbers of probes
makes integration of multiple arrayCGH datasets used for similar
studies, a challenging problem. From a data analysis perspective,
the arrayCGH data are series of real values labeled by their
chromosomal positions. The traditional approach is an interpolation
between the two series of probe locations from two platforms.
As described in Figure l, in an interpolation probe locations on
one platform are added (interpolated) to the target platform and
the corresponding CNV intensities are guessed by intensities of
the most nearby probes in the target platform. However, when the
two platforms have large variations in the number of probes, the
interpolation is not an appropriate way to integrate the two series
of probes. Speciﬁcally, when the two series are both sparse, the
interpolated points might give misleading or wrong information. For
example, in Figure 1, some of the probes are interpolated to locations
close to probes with opposite CNV. When the probes are sparsely
located, this might introduce false positives. Moreover, some of the
interpolated probes are far from other probes. In these cases (i.e. the
interpolated probes marked by ‘?’ in the ﬁgure), it is ambiguous to
decide the CNV for the interpolated new probes.

Fig. 1. A hypothetical example of interpolation and probe alignment. Interpolation and probe alignment are applied to compare the same two chromosomes.
The probe locations are marked with vertically striped blocks (ampliﬁcations) or horizontally striped blocks (deletions). The interpolation interpolates each
probe to its corresponding position on the chromosome and add a new probe in the other series. The CNV value of the new probe is guessed by checking
the neighboring probes in the same series. The probe alignment aligns nearby probe pairs in the two series with similar CNVs. The matched probe pairs are
connected by arrows in the alignment. The interpolated probes marked with “.7” are possibly wrongly labeled in the interpolation.

In this article, we propose to integrate arrayCGH datasets with
probe alignment. As shown in Figure 1, two series of probes from
two arrayCGH samples are aligned based on both their chromosomal
locations and their CNV log-ratios. The probes in one series are
matched to the probes in the other. The alignment representing an
approximate positional matching of the two compared chromosomes
with the maximum possible overlap of CNV events. The probe
alignment seeking the maximum possible CNV overlap is motivated
by the fact that two tumor samples are likely to share some common
aberration regions related to tumor development and progression.
If a probe in one series shares the same CNV with another nearby
probe in the other series, it is likely that the two probes capture
the same common tumor aberration in the two samples. Thus, the
two probes should be aligned to enhance the signal. Based on this
assumption, a probe alignment is more capable of detecting weak
common CNV signals between two chromosomes if only sparse
information is available. The problem of ﬁnding the best alignment
of two probe series can be solved by a variation of the standard global
sequence alignment algorithm (Durbin et (11., 1998). Compared with
interpolation, the main advantage of probe alignment is that the copy
number of the chromosomal regions between probes are inferred
based on the information of all the probes, instead of only the nearby
ones, and the optimal global alignment provides the best guess of
the CNVs in these regions.

Based on probe alignment, a probe alignment kernel derived from
the probe alignment scores is introduced for classiﬁcation of patient
samples from multiple datasets. In the classiﬁcation task, a binary
classiﬁer is trained to predict the tumor grade or cancer stages of a
patient using the CNV information in different arrayCGH data. With
the probe alignment kernel, many more patient samples from other
datasets can be used to improve classiﬁcation performance on one
dataset. A multiple alignment algorithm is also designed to align
all the probe series for identifying common CNV regions across
patient samples from many datasets. In this case, many probe series
from several arrayCGH datasets are aligned probe-by-probe, and
the ﬁnal alignment proﬁle can reveal the detected common CNV
regions along the chromosomes.

Sequence alignment algorithms are well-established methods for
protein/nucleic acid sequence analysis (Durbin et (11., 1998). Famous
examples are Needleman—Wunsch algorithm, Smith—Waterman
algorithm and fast approximations such as BLAST/PSI-BLAST
(Altschul et (11., 1997). The applications of these algorithms were
relatively only limited to biological sequences rather than other
types of data. It is worth mentioning that Aach and Church (2001)
proposed to use an alignment algorithm to align time series of gene

expressions. Although motivated by another application, the central
philosophy of ﬁnding a synchronization of two series to replace
simple interpolation is closely related. There are several previous
approaches for segmentation and CNV detection from arrayCGH
data. For example, Guha et (11. (2008) proposed a Bayesian hidden
Markov model to model relation between neighboring probes.
Because these approaches assumes discrete copy number states
without quantifying the distance between probes, they are not
directly applicable in the multi-platform scenario.

2 METHODS

In this section, we ﬁrst describe how to align two probe series. We next
introduce the probe alignment kernels for classiﬁcation of CNV samples
and a multiple alignment algorithm for identifying common disease in CNV
regions. Finally, the time complexity of probe alignment is analyzed.

2.1 Pairwise alignment of probe series

We denote the series of arrayCGH probes on a chromosome as a ﬁnite
sequence of tuples (x1,11),(x2,12),...,(x,,1,),..., where each x, denotes the
log-ratio intensity of the i-th probe and 1, denotes the location of the probe
on the chromosome by kilo base pairs (kb). Given two such sequences U =
(111,al),(u2,a2),...,(u,,,a,,) and V=(v1 ,bl),(v2,b2),...,(v,,,,b,,,) of length n
and m, respectively, we deﬁne three functions, S(i,j), L(i,j) and R(i,j), for
computing the alignment between the subsequences (111 ,al ), . . . , (u,,a,) in U
and the subsequences(v1,b1),...,(Vj,bj)in V. S(i,j) is the optimal alignment
score when (u,,a,) is aligned with (VJ-lg); L(i,j) is the optimal alignment
score when (u,,a,) is aligned with a gap and R(i , j) is the optimal score when
(VJ-lg) is aligned with a gap. Finally, a function M(i,j) deﬁned as the max
of S(i,j), L(i,j) and R(i,j) gives the optimal alignment score up to position
i in U and positionj in V. With initialization S(O,*)=S(*,O)=L(*,O)=
L(O, *) =R(>l<, 0) =R(0, *) = 0, the functions can be recursively evaluated with
a variation of standard dynamic programming as follows,

M(i—1,j—1)+s(i,j)
S(i,j) = max S(i,j—1)+s(i,j)
5(i-1wj)+s(llj)

£031) = M(i-1,j)+g
R031): M(i,j-1)+g
MUJ) = maxlSUJLLUJ),R(i,j)}

where function s(i , j) gives the substitution score between (u,,a,) and (v,,b,-)
and constant g is a gap penalty. The gaps in the alignment are introduced to
capture the regions that are sufﬁciently covered by probes in one platform
but not the other. Note in our formulation, a probe in one probe series can
be matched with multiple probes in the other series, i.e. we also consider
S(i,j—1)+s(i,j) and S(i—1,j)+s(i,j) when S(i,j) is calculated. Because

Integrating arrayCGH data with probe alignment

 

different platforms have different probe densities, it is more reasonable to
allow one-to-many matching in the alignment.

Given two probe series U and V, the substitution score s(i, j) between
(u,,a,) and (VJ-lg) needs to be designed to quantify a composition of
two measurements: ﬁrst, how close the two positions a, and b,- are,
and second, how similar the two CNV log-ratios u, and v,- are. The
substitution scores should encourage alignment of probe pairs that have
similar ampliﬁcation/deletion log-ratios at nearby locations. A simplest
scoring function can be deﬁned as follows:

—|a,-—I;,|
s(i,j)=eT>i<u,>i<vj-, (1)
—la,'—II'|

where 2T quantiﬁes how close the two positions are and u,>i<v,- is a
simple measure of whether the two CNV log-ratios are similar or opposite.
In this scoring function, the distance on a chromosome is normalized by
a constant a, which can be estimated from the actual probe locations in
the probe series data. The closer the two probes, the larger the score. The
similarity between two CNV log-ratios is simply taken as the product of
the two values. The main advantage of this scoring function is that it is
straightforward and parameter free. Note that, because the probes might
represent the DNA copy numbers in chromosome regions of various lengths,
the optimal probe alignment does not necessarily preserve the best sequential
mappings between the two series by locations. Thus, a probe might not be

matched with its closest peers in the other series in the alignment.
To produce more reﬁned multiple probe alignments (MPAs), the scoring
function in Equation (1) can be extended to be a positive function as follows:

—|a,-—Izv|

sri.j>=eT’ *([ui*v,-]++1), (2)

where [11, *Vj]+ is a reﬁned product based on the sign and the value of u, and
vi, deﬁned as below

“pH/j, 
l1*>l<V' = .
[ l ]]+ {0, otherw1se.

The product is then shifted by 1 to keep the positiveness. The reﬁned
similarity between 11, and v,- considers two scenarios. First, when u, and v,-
have the same Sign, the similarity is still the product between them. Second,
when u, and v,- have different signs, the similarity between them is 0. In this
scoring scheme, two probes with exactly the same position but different
CNV signs will still be matched together to prevent needlessly penalizing
the matches with gap insertions. This also implies that two probes at the
same chromosomal position will still be matched even if they have opposite
CNV events.

The choice of the gap penalty g depends on the substitution function s(i , j).
If the substitution function in Equation (1) is used, g can simply be set to a
very small positive constant, which guarantees that a gap is preferred over
matching two probes with different signs, and that only a very small value
is added to the overall alignment score from the gap insertions. Intuitively,
when g is small enough, an identical alignment and similar kernels will be
resulted. If the substitution function in Equation (2) is employed, the gap
penalty g=e_7r is used to match the scaling of the new scoring function. By
deﬁnition, this gap penalty only allows two probes with different signs to
match if their distance on the chromosome is less than 1'. This means that two
probes with different signs will be matched if they are close-by sufﬁciently
on the chromosome. 1' can be empirically chosen as a value smaller than a.

2.2 Probe alignment kernel

To address the problem that there is no direct way to integrate
arrayCGH/CGH proﬁles from different platforms in classiﬁcation, we
propose a kernel based on probe alignment, which measures the similarity
between samples with their probe alignment scores. The probes located on the
DNA of each chromosome of human genome are aligned and the alignment
scores are summarized as the kernel value. The alignment kernel function
computing the best global alignment score between U and V is given as

follows:

K(U,V) = “(011,611),---(uman)),((V1,b1),---(Vm,bm)))

= M(m,n)’ (3)

m+n

 

where the alignment score is normalized by m+n, the lengths of the two
series to avoid the bias by the number of probes.

The kernel function K (U , V) is used to compute the alignment score
between two probe series of a particular human chromosome. Given two
arrayCGH samples each with P chromosomes in genome (23 pairs of
chromosomes in Human genome), the total alignment score between the two
samples is the summation of the best global alignment scores of the P pairs of
chromosomes. Let {U(l), . . . U(P)} and {V(l), . . . V(P)} denoting the two sets of
probe sequences of the chromosomes. The probe-alignment kernel function
1C is deﬁned as

P
1C({U<‘>,...U<P>}, {V(l),...V(P)})=ZK(U(i), V03)

1:]
We choose the scoring function given in Equation (1) for the probe alignment
kernel. When all the probe positions can be perfectly matched between the
two series, the probe alignment kernel tends to be very close to a simple
linear kernel between the two probe series, where the kernel is simply the
summation of the matched 11, *Vj in the two series. Note that the probe
alignment kernel is not positive semi-deﬁnite (PSD), similar to the alignment
kernel for protein classiﬁcation (Liao and Noble, 2003). A positive constant
is added to the diagonal of the kernel matrix to make it a valid kernel.

2.3 Multiple alignment of probe series

Similar to the multiple alignment algorithms for protein/DNA sequences,
a multiple alignment procedure can also be used to align multiple probe
series from different arrayCGH datasets. The MPA can reveal common
ampliﬁcation or deletion events even if the probe sets are at different
chromosomal positions. We adopted the progressive multiple alignment
strategy (Thompson et (11., 1994) and used the pairwise probe alignment with
scoring function deﬁned in Equation (2) for base alignment. The algorithm
is described in Supplementary Section 1.

The algorithm continuously merges the two most similar probe series
and ﬁnally, gives the alignment merged from all the series. Merging two
probe series is the crucial step. To accomplish the best merging, we slightly
extended the deﬁnition of a probe series by adding a weight to each
probe in the series to make a new sequence of triples (x,,1,,w,). Each
weight w, quantiﬁes the importance of the probe by keeping the count of
the number of probes that have been merged into this probe in previous
alignments. Speciﬁcally, two such series X” =(111,a1,w1), ...,(11,,,a,,,w,,)and
X}, =(v1,bl,wj),...,(v,,,,b,,,,w;n) are merged as a new series Xagb based on
their alignment. There are two types of probes in the alignment: (i) the probe
is aligned with a gap and (ii) the probe is matched with some probe(s). New
probes are calculated for these two cases as follows:

(1) If a triple (u,,a,,w,) or (vi,bj,wj’-) is matched with a gap in the
alignment between X” and Xb, the triple is kept unchanged and directly
added into the new series Xagb.

(2) Because some consecutive probes in one series can be matched
with some consecutive probes in the other series, multiple triples
from both series might need to be merged as one new probe.
Suppose {(uivaivwi)t(ui+lvai+lvwi+l)7"'t(ui+k1vai+klvwi+k1)} and
{(Vj,bj,w]’.), (Vj+1 , 17H] , w;+l), . . . , (Vj+k2 , bj+k2 ,wj’.+,{2 )} are the two sets
of multiple triples of length [<1 and k2, respectively, that need to be
merged. We combine them as a new tuple (z,c,w”) by

i'l-kl f+k2 i+k1 f+k2

Note that the position of the new probe is calculated as a weighted average
of the merged positions to relieve possible bias introduced by outlier probes.

2.4 Fast probe alignment in linear time complexity
The direct implementation of the recursive dynamic programming runs in
quadratic time. Under an idea similar to fast-banded sequence alignment,
probe alignment can be computed in linear time complexity. The motivation
is that those probe pairs which are too far from each other will never be
matched in the optimal alignment; otherwise, there always exists a better
path that replaces the bad matches with more insertions and deletions. Thus,
in the linear time implementation, only those probe pairs that are in locations
close enough need to be considered in the alignment. Speciﬁcally, we prove
the following two propositions:

Given two probe series, U=(111,al),(u2,a2),...,(u,,,a,,) and V:
(v1,b1),(v2,b2), . . .,(v,,,,b,,,), and a small positive gap penalty g, let 11max =
maX(IM1I,---,lun|) and Vmax =mﬂX(IV1|,---, IVmI)-

PROPOSITION 1. The optimal alignment between U and V will only consist
of gaps and pairs of aligned probes (U,,V,-) with |a,—b,-| <9, where 6:
0*(ln(“maxvmax) _ lug)-

PROPOSITION 2. The number of probe pairs that need to be considered in
probe alignment is 0( %), where 8 = min{b,-+1 —b,-}.

Proposition 1 states that in the optimal alignment, only those probe pairs
with distance less than a threshold 6 can be possibly aligned. Proposition
2 states that the number of such pairs is upper bounded by %, where 8 is
the minimal distance between the adjacent probe locations in V. Thus, the
dynamic programming only needs to explore a linear number of pairs deﬁned
as a function of 6 and (3. The complete proof of the two propositions are given

in Supplementary Section 2.

3 EXPERIMENTS

We evaluated both the probe alignment kernel and the MPA
algorithm with experiments on three bladder cancer datasets as
well as simulations. Support vector machines (SVMs) were used
as the classiﬁer in all the classiﬁcation tasks. Both linear and RBF
kernels were tested for the interpolation method. In all experiments,
we tested SVM parameter C={10_4, 10T3, ..., 104} and RBF_(7=
{10—3, 10—2,..., 103}.

3.1 Simulations

In the simulations, we ﬁrst generated 10000 possible locations for
probe sampling with a Markov model. We assume that locations are
from two types of chromosome regions: gene-rich and non-coding
regions. The probe density in gene-rich regions is higher than that
in non-coding regions. Speciﬁcally, the distance between adjacent
locations is 1 in gene-rich regions and 10 in non-coding regions.
The Markov model takes two states { ‘gene-rich region’, ‘non-coding
region’} with a transition probability 0.9 for staying at a state and 0.1
for jumping between the states. Thus, continuous gene-rich or non-
coding regions with variable lengths will be generated by the Markov
model. We randomly generated 50 samples of probe series in the
case group and another 50 in the control group by random sampling
from the 10000 locations in each experiment. We simulated the
DNA ampliﬁcation and deletion events in the case samples for two
test scenarios. In the ﬁrst scenario, we randomly selected 20 regions
(10 ampliﬁcations and 10 deletions), each of which consists of 10
consecutive locations out of the 10000 locations as discriminant
CNVs on the chromosome. In the second scenario, we randomly

selected 20 regions with variable numbers of locations between
1 and 20. This strategy generates CNV regions with signiﬁcantly
different lengths to mimic short chunks as well as large chunks
of DNA ampliﬁcation/deletions. The feature value of a probe that
is not in a CNV region is generated from a normal distribution
N (00.52). The rule implies that in normal individuals, a DNA
ampliﬁcation or deletion is a relatively rare event. A probe in the
CNV regions in a case sample will take a value from a normal
distribution N (1 / — 1,052) to indicate a measured CNV value at
the locations in the ampliﬁcation/deletion regions.

We compared the standard interpolation with the alignment
kernel using the cost function deﬁned in Equation (1) and a small
gap g=0.001. In the standard interpolation, a linear interpolation
maps the missing positions in each series. The feature value at an
interpolated position is assigned the distance-weighted average of
the two nearest positions. After interpolation, each sample will have
a feature vector of the same dimension, and standard classiﬁers
such as SVM can be used for classiﬁcation. We randomly generated
datasets and tested the classiﬁcation accuracy with a 5-fold cross-
validation. In each fold, another 4-fold cross-validation on the
training set is used to tune parameters for each algorithm. The
average accuracy of each algorithm is reported in Table 1. The
alignment kernel clearly outperformed the interpolation method.
When probes are sparse, the improvement is up to 12%. When there
are more probes available, the improvement is smaller. Especially,
when 1000 probes are sampled, the improvement is only 3%. In
the experiments with variable number of probes per sample or with
variable number of locations per ampliﬁcation/deletion region, the
alignment kernel also signiﬁcantly outperformed the interpolation.
The experiments proved that the alignment kernel could handle
sparse probe series with varying numbers of probes or varying
lengths of ampliﬁcations/deletions well for classiﬁcation.

To compare the multiple alignment algorithm with the
interpolation method, we also tested alignment of multiple probe
series for identifying the true common CNV regions. The multiple
alignment algorithm used the scoring ﬁinction deﬁned by Equation
(2) with 1': 110. For better visualization, we only report the results
on small datasets without distinguishing gene-rich regions and
non-coding regions although similar results were observed on
larger datasets. We generated ﬁve samples with 100 locations,
within which there are two ampliﬁcation regions and two deletion
regions. In the example in Figure 2A, each region contains ﬁve
consecutive locations. In the example in Figure 2B, each region
contains 1—10 consecutive locations. We randomly sampled 10
features for both cases. From the two examples, the result of
multiple alignment is clearly more accurate in detecting the exact
locations of ampliﬁcations and deletions. Since the interpolation
approach propagates the information from a probe to its interpolated
neighbors, this propagation-based assumption often results in blurry
boundaries and fails to distinguish the close-by CNV events, as
visualized in the examples in Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 6.
The results suggest that the multiple alignment algorithm is more
robust to tolerate probe sparsity and noise in the data.

3.2 Bladder cancer datasets

We collected three different arrayCGH datasets generated for
studying bladder cancer. The ﬁrst dataset (D1) introduced by Blaveri
et (11. (2005) was generated with a HumanArray 2.0 array consisting

of features but at different locations; (ii) different numbers of features were extracted for each sample from a discrete uniform distribution on [1,1000]; and (iii) different numbers
of features for each sample were generated from a normal distribution N(500,1002) (rounded to positive integers). The scores that are statistically signiﬁcantly larger than the other

were not included in the study because they are not comparable
between male and female samples. After the pruning, dataset D1
contains 98 samples and 2142 probes, dataset D2 contains 57
samples and 2308 probes, and dataset D3 contains 38 samples
and 24384 probes. We tested classiﬁcation of patient samples by
tumor grades in the three datasets. The two classes are distinguished
by lower tumor grades or higher tumor grades. Speciﬁcally, we
considered ‘Low’ versus ‘High’ in D1, and ‘3G2’ versus ‘>G2’
in D2 and D3 (Rapaport et a1., 2008; Tian et al., 2009).

3.2.1 Parameter selection The a parameter is the normalization
term of the probe distances in Equations (1) and (2), and the gap
penalty g deﬁnes the scoring scale of a gap in the alignment. We
set a to be the average distance between all pairs of probes on
a chromosome, based on the statistics on each chromosome in
Supplementary Table 2. Note that different as were used for probes
on different chromosomes. In the three datasets, the as for the 22
chromosomes are all in the order of 104—105. Given the estimated
a from the data, an additional cross-validation on the training set
is performed to choose the gap penalty g in {10_5,...,10_1}. In
multiple alignment, (7 can be chosen in the same way, but the g
parameter is actually decided by the minimal allowed matching
distance 1' [Equation (2)]. Since g will only take values in the range

[e_1, 1] if 1' < a, empirically any 1' < a can give reasonable multiple
alignment on both artiﬁcial and real datasets. From the deﬁnition
g = eTg, we can expect the results of multiple alignment will not be
sensitive to 1' as long as % < 1' < (7. Thus, in the multiple alignments,
we set 1': 

3.2.2 Classiﬁcation of patient samples To evaluate the
classiﬁcation performance of the alignment kernel, we performed a
special cross-dataset validation. We ﬁrst selected a target dataset to
run 5-fold cross-validation. In the experiment on each fold, we also
used the samples in the other two datasets as additional training
samples. We performed the cross-dataset validation for D1, D2 and
D3, each with 50 times of random 5-fold cross-validation. One
additional baseline is the raw kernel ﬁinction deﬁned by Liu et a1.
(2008), which deﬁnes pairwise relations between CNV states as a
new variation of linear kernel. Note that the experiments of all the
compared methods were on the same 5 folds of each dataset. In
the experiment on each fold, another 4-fold cross-validation on the
training set was performed to tune parameters for each algorithm,
speciﬁcally, the SVM C parameter and the gap parameter g for
probe alignment, the SVM C parameter for linear kernel and raw
kernel, and the SVM C parameter and the RBF_o for RBF kernel.

Two categories of comparisons were performed. First, we tested
SVMs used with linear kernel, RBF kernel and raw kernel on
the three datasets independently but with the alignment kernel
using additional training data from the other two datasets. These
experiments were purposed to show that integrating samples from
other datasets in the training set can generate more accurate
classiﬁers. The results are reported in Table 2. Clearly, using the
additional data, the alignment kernel signiﬁcantly improved the

classiﬁcation accuracy on the three datasets. Next, the alignment
kernel was compared with the other kernels on the interpolated data
with the interpolated features on multiple datasets in all possible
combinations. The average accuracy of all the methods are listed in
Table 3. The alignment kernel outperformed or tied with the best of
linear kernel, RBF kernel and raw kernel on the interpolated data in
almost all the cases except it is the second best when tested with D3
as target and D1 for additional training.

3.2.3 Detecting common CNV regions To evaluate how well
the three datasets can be integrated to detect the common CNV
regions in bladder cancer tumors, we applied the multiple alignment
algorithm to align the samples with higher tumor grades in the three
datasets, and compared the alignment result with the interpolation
result. Since all the samples in the same dataset have identical probe
locations, we ﬁrst calculated the average log-ratio intensities of
the three datasets to get three consensus CNV probe series. The
multiple alignment method was then used to produce an MPA proﬁle

Integrating arrayCGH data with probe alignment

 

of MPA and interpolation are compared in Figure 3. Many of the
common CNV regions identiﬁed by the two methods are similar, but
the alignment proﬁle is smoother. The interpolation method reported
many more short fragments, many of which are false positives. One
remarkable ﬁnding is that the MPA captured four known bladder
cancer genes in the common CNV regions, while the interpolation
only identiﬁed one.

The MPA detected four bladder cancer genes, DBCl, TSCl, RB 1
and BLCAP, and several common ampliﬁcation/deletion regions
associated with bladder cancer. DBCl (deleted in bladder cancer 1)
is a gene that shows loss of heterozygosity in some bladder tumors.
TSCl’s somatic mutations are associated with the tumor cases
with one copy of the TSCl gene missing due to a deletion in
chromosome 9. The two genes were identiﬁed at the end of the
second deletion regions in the alignment proﬁle on chromosome
9. RBI with mutations, believed to contribute to the development
of bladder cancer, is identiﬁed at the ﬁrst ampliﬁcation region
on chromosome 13. BLCAP (bladder cancer-associated protein),
believed to be involved in the cancercinogenesis, is identiﬁed
at the second ampliﬁcation region at chromosome 20. Besides
these bladder cancer genes, the MPA also identiﬁed some common
ampliﬁcation and deletion regions associated with bladder cancer.
For example, we identiﬁed an ampliﬁcation event at location 6p22
with a main target gene E2F3 (Oeggerli et a1., 2006). Deletions of
part of or all chromosome 9 are common events in bladder tumors
and we identiﬁed these events including a known location 9p21.
The results are compared with previous studies on the datasets
(Blaveri et a1., 2005; Heidenblad et a1., 2008) in Supplementary
Table 3. The MPA can retrieve most ﬁndings from these independent
studies, which implies that probe alignment successfully integrated
information from the three datasets. The multiple alignment also
missed some ampliﬁcation/deletion regions, many of which might be
false positives that were manually identiﬁed in a very small number
of samples.

4 DISCUSSIONS

Integration of diverse genomic datasets has become one of the
central problems in cancer genomics. Most of the previous work on
arrayCGH data analysis focused only on segmentation of the probe
series for deriving real CNV events. In this article, we introduce a
general probe alignment framework to integrate arrayCGH datasets
generated on different platforms. We demonstrated with experiments
that the probe alignment-based approaches have a good potential
to generate signiﬁcantly improved classiﬁcation performance and
detect more accurate common CNVs. The results suggest that these
approaches are powerﬁil tools for integrative studies of multiple
arrayCGH datasets. There are three technical issues in applying
probe alignment: fast implementation, parameter tuning and kernel
selection.

0 We tested the fast probe alignment described in Section 2.4 to
show that only a small fraction of the entries in the dynamic
programming matrix needs to be computed. Although the
probe locations and log-ratios are highly variable in different
platforms, we empirically observed that the time complexity
is indeed close to linear in our experiments (Supplementary
Fig. 1). However, it is also possible that a larger gap
penalty is needed to reduce the time complexity signiﬁcantly,

which might lead to worse classiﬁcation results. In this case,
approximation is necessary to restrict the alignment to a smaller
number of probe pairs to produce sub-optimal alignment scores
for classiﬁcation.

0 Intuitively, a good a should be in the same scale of the average
probe distances as estimated in Supplementary Table 2 to
distinguish the difference in the distances between matched
probes. Small positive gs will result in identical alignment
and similar good classiﬁcation results with less impact from
the gaps. We veriﬁed the intuitions by additional classiﬁcation
experiments in Supplementary Fig. 2. For a more rigorous
treatment of the problem, based on a comprehensive analysis of
the datasets (Supplementary Figs 3—5 and Table 2), we suggest
a strategy that estimates the a as the average probe distance
and selects a gap penalty by a cross-validation in the training
set, as a robust strategy to choose good parameters for SVM
classiﬁcation. For the multiple alignment case, we suggest the
same strategy for choosing a and taking a gap penalty g that is
decided by the allowable distance between the matched probes
for generating reasonable multiple alignment. In practice, both
strategies worked well.

0 Finally, the probe alignment kernel is not guaranteed PSD.
Besides adding a positive constant on the diagonal, another
alternative that we tested is to use the nearest PSD matrix of the
alignment-score matrix as the kernel matrix (Higharn, 1988).
However, we observed that the nearest PSD matrix is not a
good kernel in the experiments (Supplementary Table 1).

A promising future direction is to combine segmentation
approaches with alignment. The segmentation approaches detect
the actual CNV intervals in each probe series and the alignment
approach can be modiﬁed to align the intervals. We performed an
initial segmentation analysis on the three bladder cancer datasets
with the segmentation method proposed in Olshen et a1. (2004).
At the suggested signiﬁcance level, the segmentation detected very
few intervals of ampliﬁcations and deletions that can be used for
alignment. Thus, one difﬁculty is how to choose the parameters
such as window length or signiﬁcance levels for getting sensible
segmentation results for alignment. In addition, aligning the detected
CNV intervals in segmentation requires development of a new
alignment approach to compare CNV intervals. Thus, the alignment
approach in this article is not directly applicable. Another possible
extension is to distinguish regions with different probe density
(gene-rich versus non-coding) with different normalization for
further improvement of classiﬁcation or common CNV detection.
Certainly, this extension requires more sophisticated treatment of
the alignment functions, which will introduce additional complexity
to the problem.

Regional heritability advanced complex trait analysis

 

purchase cost is dependent on memory requirements, which, in
turn, are dataset—speciflc.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi—region function—
ality, we have used the world’s second fastest (at the time of
writing) open—access supercomputer, Titan. This Cray XK7 ma—
chine is based at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the USA
and comprises 18 688 nodes, each with a single NVIDIA K20X
GPU augmenting an AMD Opteron 6274 16—core CPU, where
the nodes are connected via the Cray Gemini network.

We split the 987 320 SNPs into regions of size 100 SNPs, with
an overlap of 50 SNPs between regions: a total of 19 746 regions
(where a separate GRM creation and REML analysis are per—
formed for each). We analyze these in parallel using 1024 GPUs,
where each GPU automatically iterates through its subset of re—
gions. This run took 15min 26 s. From the individual region
timings, we can infer that on a single GPU, this would have
taken a factor of 842 longer: >9 days. It is noteworthy that in
the same time, our software would allow us to determine empir—
ical levels of statistical significance by permutations. The devi—
ation from ideal scaling (of a factor of 1024) is due to the fact

that the time per region varies and the load is not perfectly
distributed between GPUs. This may be improved in future
work through redistribution strategies at run—time.

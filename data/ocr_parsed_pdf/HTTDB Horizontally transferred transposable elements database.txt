Abstract

 

Motivation: Horizontal transfer of transposable (H'l'l') elements among eukaryotes was discovered
in the mid—1980s. As then, >300 new cases have been described. New findings about H'l'l' are re—
vealing the evolutionary impact of this phenomenon on host genomes. In order to provide an up to
date, interactive and expandable database for such events, we developed the H'|'|'—DB database.
Results: H'|'|'—DB allows easy access to most of H'l'l' cases reported along with rich information
about each case. Moreover, it allows the user to generate tables and graphs based on searches
using Transposable elements and/or host species classification and export them in several
formats.

Availability and implementation: This database is freely available on the web at http://lpa.saogab—
rieI.unipampa.edu.br:8080/httdatabase. H'|'|'—DB was developed based on Java and MySQL with all
major browsers supported. Tools and software packages used are free for personal or non—profit

projects.

1 Introduction

Transposable elements (TEs) are ‘mobile genes’ that replicate inside
the host genome moving from one genomic location to another. TEs
are known as genomic parasites, since they do not contribute to host
fitness and exploit the host’s molecular machinery for their replica—
tion. However, an increasing amount of evidence suggests that TEs
can also act as evolutionary engine of organism adaptations
(Gonzales et (11., 2010; Mateo et (11., 2014).

Once these elements invade a new species, they may be vertically
transmitted to the entire progeny through the host gametes (Werren,
2011). However, due to their repetitive and mobile nature, TEs can
damage the host genome, through chromosome rearrangements and
new insertions, hence being counter selected at the host level (Petrov
et (11., 2011). In addition, TEs can be lost from host genomes

through stochastic loss or genetic drift (Brookfield, 2005). All of
these processes contribute to the extinction of TEs from host gen—
omes. Despite that, almost all organism analysed to date have a pro—
portion of its genomes composed by TEs (Pritham, 2009; Hua—Van,
2011). One hypothesis suggested to explain such contradiction is
that TEs are capable of invading new genomes through Horizontal
transfer (HT) then escaping the natural fate of vertical extinction
(Silva et (11., 2004).

The horizontal transfer of transposable (HTT) elements between
reproductively isolated eukaryotic species has been intriguing geneti—
cists and evolutionary biologists since it was first reported in the mid
1980s (Daniels et (11., 1984, 1990). Several new cases have been re—
ported since then, highlighting the potential impact of invading TEs
on host genome evolution. Such a large amount of data boosted the

conception of two reviews about this topic, where general patterns
governing such events could be investigated (Schaack et al., 2010;
Wallau et al., 2012)

Due to the ever—increasing number of HTT events reported and
the impact of such events on the host genomes, we decided to create
the HTT database, providing an easy way for researchers to browse
the data and take knowledge based decision for future research on
this topic.

2 Programing languages and databases

HTT—DB was developed using a relational database (MySQL v
5.6.12) implemented in HTML and Java, running into a Web Server
(Apache Tomcat 8.0.12 Server). We used Eclipse Java EE IDE as the
developing tool. As programming languages, we used Java SE—1.7,
HTML, javascript, and as plugins we used Jquery, Jquery UI, Jquery
Multiple Select, Highcharts JS, BattaTech Jquery Excel Export,
Jquery Tablesorter 2.0 and jsPhyloSVG (Smits et al., 2010). Tools
and software packages used are free for personal or non—profit
projects.

3 Data mining

Previously reported HTT cases were recovered from the two reviews
published previously (Schaack et al., 2010; Wallau et al.,
2012<AQ4/>) and the new cases were obtained searching in
PubMed—NCBI and Google Scholar with the keywords ‘horizontal
transfer’, ‘horizontal transmission’, ‘horizontal transposon transfer’
and ‘HTT elements’. This same search pattern will be performed
monthly in order to find new published HTT cases.

4 HTT database features

The HTT database is organised as a table with several columns that
can be filtered by ‘TEs keywords’ following the TEs classification
hosted in Repbase: Class, Superfamily and Family; and/or ‘Host
Organisms keywords’ following the NCBI taxonomy as:

(i) Organism—the higher taxonomic level before the taxonomic
level were the HTT occurred. For example, if the user select
‘Drosoploila’ in this ﬁeld, all HTT events reported between species
of the Drosophila genus will be shown.

(ii) Taxonomic level—the taxonomic level where the HTT occurred.
For instance, if the user select the ‘Family’ option, all HTT events
reported between species from different families will be shown.

The next two columns contains the available data about the
HTT dating in million years (Mya) and the ecological relationship
between the HTT involved species, if any.

One of the main features of the HTT database is its interactive
interface, allowing the user to search and filter the database based
on one or a combination of several keywords, both from TEs and
host taxonomy. Resulting tables can be converted into interactive
graphs that can be exported in several figure formats, as shown in
Figure 1.

We also linked the original published manuscript where HTT
events were described. Additionally, we included a ‘How to add
data’ tab that can be used by researchers publishing new cases of
HTT and who want to include their data in the database. All new
submitted HTT cases only will be accepted and added to the data—
base if they were published in peer reviewed journals.

5 Availability and long-term database
maintenance

The database is available at the web server of the Universidade
Federal do Pampa and will be maintained by this university for an
unlimited time. HTT—DB is a free database, which is publicly avail—
able at (http://lpa.saogabriel.unipampa.edu.br:8080/httdatabase)
and open for the deposition of additional data. Moreover, the data—
base is expandable and can incorporate all new findings as our
knowledge about HTT or HT in general increases.

6 Future developments

Virus—to—host and horizontal gene transfer are other interesting phe—
nomenon that can be added to the HTT—DB in a similar fashion.

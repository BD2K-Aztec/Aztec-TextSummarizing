ABSTRACT

Motivation: Much of the large-scale molecular data from living
cells can be represented in terms of networks. Such networks
occupy a central position in cellular systems biology. In the protein—
protein interaction (PPI) network, nodes represent proteins and
edges represent connections between them, based on experimental
evidence. As PPI networks are rich and complex, a mathematical
model is sought to capture their properties and shed light on PPI
evolution. The mathematical literature contains various generative
models of random graphs. It is a major, still largely open question,
which of these models (if any) can properly reproduce various
biologically interesting networks. Here, we consider this problem
where the graph at hand is the PPI network of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. We are trying to distinguishing between a model family
which performs a process of copying neighbors, represented by the
duplication—divergence (DD) model, and models which do not copy
neighbors, with the Barab si—Albert (BA) preferential attachment
model as a leading example.

Results: The observed property of the network is the distribution of
maximal bicliques in the graph. This is a novel criterion to distinguish
between models in this area. It is particularly appropriate for this
purpose, since it reflects the graph’s growth pattern under either
model. This test clearly favors the DD model. In particular, for the
BA model, the vast majority (92.9%) of the bicliques with both sides
34 must be already embedded in the model’s seed graph, whereas
the corresponding figure for the DD model is only 5.1%. Our results,
based on the biclique perspective, conclusively show that a na ve
unmodified DD model can capture a key aspect of PPI networks.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many real-life systems can be modeled as complex networks, or
graphs, of interacting components. Although the study of such large-
scale networks is not new, there has recently been much renewed
interest in this ﬁeld. This is due to technological advances of two
types: (i) the collection of data which depict large networks in
high-resolution detail, and (ii) the development of computational
tools for the analysis of data. Among the well-studied examples
of such networks are the World Wide Web, citation networks,
neuronal connections, metabolic networks, ecological webs and

more (for reviews, see Albert and Barabasi, 2002; Dorogovtsev and
Mendes, 2002; Newman, 2003).

One of the best studied network types is the protein—protein
interaction (PPI) network. Protein interactions play a crucial role
in the execution of biological functions in any model system.
Accordingly, a systematic mapping of PPI on the scale of the
whole proteome—the interactome—has recently become available
for major model systems from yeast (Ito et (11., 2001; Yu
et (11., 2008) to human (Gandhi et (11., 2006). Although far
from complete, PPI network mappings have revealed topological
and dynamic features of the interactome that are common to
numerous model systems (Gandhi et (11., 2006). However, the
overall size of interactomes differs substantially between human
and other multicellular model organisms, including the Drosophila
melanogaster and the Caenorhabditis elegans (Stumpf et (11., 2008).

PPIs are usually represented by an undirected graph (network).
Every node in such a network corresponds to a protein, and there
is an edge between two nodes, if the two corresponding proteins
interact physically. Such networks have been mapped for several
organisms using high-throughput (HTP) techniques such as Yeast-
2-Hyrbid (Y2H) Systems (Ito et (11., 2001; Krogan et (11., 2006)
and co-immunoprecipitation (Gavin et (11., 2002; von Mering et (11.,
2002). HTP techniques are prone to a high rate of false positives and
false negatives.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s yeast) is the organism with
the most comprehensive, high-coverage interactome mapping. Other
PPI networks, such as those of Escherichia coli and Helicobacter
pylori were investigated as well, but they are far from being complete
(Rain et (11., 2001). The PPI networks of human, Drosophila
melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans are more complex, due
to their multicellular nature. Speciﬁcally, interactomes are harder to
deﬁne, as they vary between different cell types, and subsequently,
harder to map.

The PPI network of yeast was reﬁned over the years, followed by a
critical assessment of data quality (Bader and Hogue, 2002) {Chua,
2008 #19}. While the topology of the partial PPI network obtained
from each of the main technologies is different (Yu et (11., 2008), the
combination of PPI data from such complementary experimental
technologies resulted in a near complete map (Reguly et (11., 2006).
For most organisms, the interaction data are still partial and thus
topological assessment of these networks is prone to sampling biases
(Han et (11., 2004).

It is not obvious how to infer direct pairwise interactions
from HTP techniques that focus on protein complexes (i.e.
co-immunoprecipitation). This is especially challenging when
complexes of several proteins are considered. To document and

PPI networks-the biclique perspective

 

describe protein interactions, several databases have been compiled,
offering curated data from various sources (Guldener et al., 2006;
Salwinski et al., 2004; Stark et al., 2006; Xenarios and Eisenberg,
2001).

A random graph model is a probability space of graphs. It is
often described in terms of a random process that generates graphs.
Unfortunately, the most thoroughly studied classical random graph
model—the Erdos—Renyi (ER) model (Erdos and Renyi, 1959)—
does not capture the properties of PPI networks. This gave rise to
numerous attempts at deﬁning other random models that generate
graphs which are more reminiscent of the PPI graphs encountered in
nature. We focus here on two families of random models which have
received considerable attention in recent literature, the preferential
attachment model [or the Barabasi—Albert (BA) model]; and the
duplication—divergence (DD) model.

How does one test the agreement between a random graph model
and a given set of data? It appears to be computationally hard to
determine the exact probability that a particular network is generated
by a given model. Therefore, attempts to ﬁt a network to a model are
usually realized by calculating certain statistics of the network, and
comparing it with predictions derived from a model. Much attention
was given to the degree distribution of the network in question (recall
that the degree of a node is the number of neighbors it has in the
graph). In particular, it was often claimed that the degree distribution
is governed by a power-law (but see D’Souza, et al., 2007; Deeds,
et al., 2006; Khanin and Wit, 2006; Lima-Mendez and van Helden,
2009; Mitzenmacher, 2004; Reiko et al., 2005; Stumpf, 2005;
Stumpf et al., 2005). Namely, that Pdeg(k)—the probability that a
node has k neighbors is proportional to k_7’, where y is a network-
dependent constant. Other important parameters are counts of ﬁxed
subgraphs. This approach has a strong theoretical underpinning
in recent work such as Lovasz and Szegedy (2006). This general
idea is materialized in a variety of concrete ways: small connected
subgraphs (Hormozdiari et al., 2007; PrZulj, 2004), dense subgraphs
(Colak et al., 2009), tree subgraphs (Alon et al., 2008), local walks
(Middendorf et al., 2004) and k-hop reachability (Hormozdiari et al.,
2007). Other measures include centrality, betweenness and more.

Motivated by the apparent power-law behavior, the preferential
attachment model (aka the BA model) was introduced (Barabasi and
Albert, 1999). In this generative model, one starts with a seed graph,
and new nodes are iteratively added to the graph. Every new node
is linked by m edges to previously occurring nodes, where this set
of neighbors is selected non-uniformly. Concretely, the probability
of connecting to a given existing node is proportional to the degree
of that node (Fig. 1A). As noted in Bollobas and Riordan (2005),
this description of the model is still incomplete. We therefore adopt
the formulation in Bollobas and Riordan (2005) as our realization
of the BA model. This model indeed produces a degree distribution
where Pdeg (k) ~ k_7’.

The Copying model or DD model was ﬁrst suggested in attempting
to explain the structure of the world-wide-web graph (Kumar et al.,
2000). It was later adopted for the analysis of PPI networks (Bebek
et al., 2006; Pastor-Satorras et al., 2003). Here, too, one starts
with a seed graph that undergoes a growth process as follows. At
every step, an existing node is randomly and uniformly selected
and duplicated, i.e. a new node is created with an identical set of
neighbors. This is followed by a random modiﬁcation: each new
edge is retained with probability P and is omitted with probability
1 —P. In addition, each existing node is connected to the new node

 

Fig. 1. Model illustrations. (A) BA model. A new node (blue) is added at
each step. For each of its outgoing edges, the probability of connecting to a
given existing node is proportional to the degree of that node. (B) DD model.
A new node (blue) is added at each step by duplicating an older node. This
is followed by a random insertion and deletion of edges.

with a probability r (see Fig. 1B. also see Supplementary Material
for details on both models). This model yields a power-law degree
distribution as well. Moreover, node duplication can represent gene
duplication, and random edge insertions and deletions are analogous
to random mutations (Ohno, 1970).

Here, we propose using counts of (non-induced) maximal
bipartite cliques, or maximal bicliques, as a method to distinguish
between DD- and BA-type models. In the network that we consider,
V is the set of nodes (proteins) and E is the set of edges (interactions).
In this context, a biclique (AB) is a subgraph consisting of two
disjoint sets of nodes (A,B g V,A ﬂB = (1)), where all edges between
these two sets exist in the graph (A XBQE). We do not impose
any conditions on the existence or non-existence of edges between
nodes in each set. A biclique is maximal if there is no other
biclique containing it, i.e whenA §A2,B g B2 and A2 X B2 g E, then
necessarily A =A2, B =B2.

Bicliques are naturally related to the DD model. The introduction
of a new node w that is a duplicate of an old node v, creates the
biclique ((v, w), N (v)). Further duplication of v or w, yields an
even larger biclique. Even with random insertions and deletions of
interactions, it is clear that essentially, it is the process of copying
neighbors that gives rise to dense bipartite graphs, and speciﬁcally
large bicliques. In contrast, in models like the BA model, where the
neighbor sets of different nodes are uncorrelated, there is no apparent
reason why large bicliques should occur. Indeed, the introduction
of the DD model was motivated by the ubiquity of large bipartite
graphs in the web graphs (Kumar et al., 2000). It was also noted
that large dense bipartite graphs exist in the yeast PPI network (Bu
et al., 2003), which were used to infer protein interactions and ﬁnd
binding motifs (Li et al., 2006). For these reasons, bicliques are
natural candidates for distinguishing between different models.

2 METHODS
2.1 Data of PPIs

Protein Interactions were extracted from database of interacting proteins
(DIP) (Salwinski at al., 2004) version December 30, 2009. The database
contains experimental data covering 5033 proteins of the S.cerevisiae
(baker’s yeast) and 22118 interaction edges, originating from 1644-4
experiments. Note that ~90% of interactions are reported by the HTP
experimental techniques of Y2H and co-immunoprecipitation. Additional,
low-throughput methods include X-ray crystallography, native gels, cross-
linking study and various afﬁnity chromatography technologies.

2.2 Parameter enumeration and optimization

Parameter optimization was performed in two stages: ﬁrst a coarse search,
and later a reﬁnement of the better performing parameters in higher
resolution. Each parameter set was used to generate more than 20 graphs.

2.3 Seed graph models and parameters

Geometric model: m0 points in Rd are sampled at random, each coordinate
independently, from the standard normal distribution, with x1?) ~N(O, 1), for
ie {1, ...,n},j e {1, ...,d}. Each node i in the seed graph corresponds to apoint
xi. There is an edge between nodes i and j if their corresponding points are
closer than a radius p: “xi —xj  5 p.

Inverse geometric model: similar to the geometric model, except that
nodes are connected if the distance between their corresponding points is
larger than a radius R: “xi —xj  ZR.

ER model: there are m0 nodes, and each possible edge between two nodes
exists uniformly at random with a probability P. See Figure 4 for a schematic
representation of the seed graph models.

Seed graph sizes were tested for 10, 20, 50, 80 and 100. Seed graph
size was allowed a change of :l:10 at the later optimization stage. For the
geometric and inverse geometric models, dimensions were tested for 2, 4, 6,
8 and 10, and were allowed a change of :l:1 at later optimization stage. Radii
were tested for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and were allowed a change of :l:0.5. For the
ER model, [7 was for values between 0 and 1 (in intervals of 0.1). For earlier
connections between PPI graphs and geometric graphs, see Priulj (2004).

2.4 Models

DD model: we follow the formalization of Bebek et a1. (2006). To create
a graph of n nodes, one begins with a seed graph of size m0. Then, n—mo
iterations are performed. In every iteration t, a node v is uniformly selected
from the previous nodes, [0, . . .,t— 1]. For each of the nodes w in N(v), the
set of neighbors of v, an edge is created between w and the new node t with
probability P, or deleted with probability 1 —P. Then, for each of the nodes
11 in [0, . . .,t— 1], u and t are connected with probability r/t. Parallel edges
are then merged.

BA model: we follow the formalization of Bollobas and Riordan (2005).
To create a graph of n nodes, one begins with a seed graph of size m0.
Then, n — m0 iterations are performed. In every iteration t, m edges are added
sequentially, stemming from node t. At each edge addition, a probability of
deg(v)/C is assigned for all vertices v in [0, . . .,t— 1], and (deg(v)+1)/C for
the node t itself, where C is a normalizing factor to make a valid probability
distribution, and the degree includes all edges previously introduced. Parallel
edges are merged.

2.5 Comparison between distributions

For two biclique distributions [7 and q, and sizes 2 5 nfm, their 12-distance
is deﬁned as:

 

“101(1): 2 (loglo (1701,!!!) + 1) _ 10g“) (11mm) + 1))2

25115»:

The +1 correction is applied to allow comparison between distributions with
different biclique sizes.

2.6 Parameter enumeration

For DD models: [7 was tested for values between 0 and 1 (in intervals of 0.02);
r was also tested for these values (although r could potentially be larger than
1, we did not test for these values as they generate too many edges, and
introduce too much randomness into the graph which reduces that impact of
the essence of the DD model).

For BA models: m was tested for sizes from 1 to 40. For DD and BA
models, sets of parameters giving less than 50000 edges in average were
discarded.

Fig. 2. An example of a biclique from the yeast PPI graph. The biclique of
size 7, 7 is shown. Proteins are indicated by their gene names. Proteins on
the left set are related to DNA repair and to events that take place at mitosis
and meiosis. Proteins on the right set participate in folding and chaperone
activity. Additional bicliques of size 7, 7 are analyzed in Supplementary
Table S 1.

2.7 Enumeration of bicliques and implementation

Biclique exhaustion and enumeration was performed with the Linear time
Closed itemset Miner, Maximal Bicliques (LCM-MBC) algorithm and the
Frequent Pattern, Maximal Bicliques (FP-MBC) software (Li et al., 2007).
The algorithm is based on gradually expanding maximal bicliques, with
efﬁcient backtracking and pruning. Graph generation, biclique enumeration
and parameters optimization were all performed in C++, and run on a linux
cluster of 250 processors with Sun Grid Engine, for approximately a week
per model.

2.8 Biological inference

Bicliques were separated to left and right set (example in Fig. 2). The
association of biological terms for with each set was performed according
to the BioAssociation protocol (Jenssen et al., 2001). Sets of proteins
were tested as a group in an enrichment protocol for gene ontology
(GO) annotation enrichment using DAVID (Huang da et al., 2009). Only
statistically signiﬁcant annotations are reported (P < 0.05).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Bicliques in the PPI networks are of biological
relevance

We analyzed the PPI network of S. cerevisiae through the perspective
of bicliques. Bicliques, especially the larger ones, often have a clear
biological signiﬁcance. Consequently, they capture an important
essence of the entire PPI network (Sharan et al., 2007; Ulitsky and
Sharnir, 2007).

To illustrate, Figure 2 shows a biclique of size (7, 7) from the yeast
PPI graph. In this case, there are no edges inside each set. As a ﬁrst
examination, we checked for GO annotation keyword enrichment in
each set (Ashbumer et al., 2000)

Statistical analysis of the left set, based on literature gene
associations (Jenssen et al., 2001), indicates enrichment for
keywords of ‘recombination’ (corrected P-value of 9.86e-33) and
‘sporulation’ (corrected P-value of 3 .22e-148). Actually, the proteins
are strongly related to DNA repair and to events that take place
at mitosis and meiosis. Proteins in the right set participate in
folding and chaperone activity. Speciﬁcally, proteins related to
stressdependent folding, peptide transport to mitochondria and
complex formation are included. All these proteins are highly

PPI networks-the biclique perspective

 

abundant and they participate in very fundamental generic cell
processes.

A biological interpretation for the two sets can be suggested.
Speciﬁcally, it shows that genes acting in the control of DNA
repair and in mitosis (left set, Fig. 2) are linked to stress-dependent
chaperones and protein import machinery (right set, Fig. 2). Cellular
mechanisms activated by DNA damage and by protein misfolding
are interconnected and share common elements (Kultz, 2005)

We performed GO-term enrichment analysis for additional
bicliques of similar properties (size 7, 7; 24 bicliques). Most of
them could indeed be associated with biological phenomena. Sets
of genes enriched in DNA-related activities (e.g. DNA repair, cell
cycle and telomere maintenance) and sets of genes involved in
protein maintenance (e. g. unfolded protein binding, stress response,
protein refolding and chaperones) appear in two sides in the analyzed
bicliques (Supplementary Table S1). Such crosstalk also prevails in
the analysis of the gene expression programs of S. cerevisiae under
multiple environmental changes (Gasch et al., 2000).

3.2 The yeast PPI has many bicliques of various sizes

We analyzed the distribution of bicliques in the PPI network of
S. cerevisiae, which consists of 5033 proteins and 22 118 interactions,
obtained from the DIP database (Salwinski et al., 2004). Each
biclique is uniquely deﬁned by the sizes of its two disjoint node
sets. So for each possible pair of sizes n,m (2 f n gm), we counted
the number of maximal bicliques of size (n,m) in the graph.

A few observations are evident. The graph indeed contains many
bicliques—a total of 126 584 distinct bicliques of all sizes (Figs 3A
and B and Supplementary Fig. S1). These bicliques range in size
from (12, 12) to (2, 70). The most abundant size is (5, 6), with 6676
(5.2% of total) bicliques of that size.

3.3 DD model yields a better ﬁt than BA with a
minimal seed

We next proceeded to generate graphs from the DD model and
from BA, with a variety of parameters, and compare the distribution
of maximal bicliques in these graphs to that of the real graph. To
eliminate effects emanating from the seed graph, we ran both models
with a minimal seed consisting of a complete graph on three nodes.

In principle, it is easy to create as many bicliques as desired,
through an appropriate choice of (extreme) parameters for the
models. If in the DD model, we let p be very small and r very large,
dense graphs will result, with many bicliques. The same applies to a
very large value of m in the BA model. It is therefore prudent to limit
the possible range of parameters to values that yield a graph with a
number of edges that is in the same order of magnitude of the real PPI
graph. We therefore limit ourselves only to parameters that generate
graphs with an average number of 50 000 edges (roughly twice the
number of edges in the yeast PPI graph). The rationale behind such
choice is the following: we expect that with the improvement of
experimental techniques, more PPIs will be discovered, including
those that are fragile and transient. In other words, each PPI graph
should be considered as only an approximation of the true ﬁill PPI
graph. However, our results seem quite insensitive to this speciﬁc
choice of the limit of the number of edges (ranging from 10 000 to
100 000) for both models.

In general, it is evident that graphs generated by the DD model
indeed contain a large number of bicliques, and those bicliques tend

to have relatively large sizes. In contrast, graphs generated by the
BA model have fewer bicliques, and those tend to be smaller. These
observations are in line with our understanding of the emergence of
bicliques, as previously discussed.

We compared the distribution of bicliques in model-generated
graphs to that of the real yeast PPI graph. The distance between
two biclique distributions was deﬁned as the 12 distance of the
distributions of the base-10 logarithm of the values. We searched
for sets of parameters for each model that generate a distribution as
similar as possible to that of the real graph.

For the BA graph, we ﬁnd that the best parameter is m = 10, giving
49 691 :l:40 edges (mean:l: SD). It is evident that despite the large
number of edges, the sizes of bicliques grow more slowly than in the
real yeast PPI graph, reaching only (5, 7) on average [albeit a longer
tail for graphs with a smaller size—up to (2157)]. The 12 distance
to the real graph is 23.39:l:0.44 (Fig. 3C).

For the DD graph, the best parameters were found to be p=0.6
and r=0.3, giving 43 251 :l: 13 379 edges. Although this graph has
roughly the same number of edges as the BA graph, we ﬁnd many
more bicliques whose sizes now vary up to (9, 10), a wider range,
closer to the real graph [also with a long tail, up to (2265)]. The
12 distance to the real graph in this case is 12.94:l: 0.62, which is
signiﬁcantly closer (Fig. 3D).

We conclude that both the sizes and the number of bicliques in the
DD model substantially exceed those of the BA model. Moreover,
with an optimal choice of parameters for both models, the DD model
ﬁts the real yeast PPI graph signiﬁcantly better than the BA graph.
Since we operate here with a degenerate, minimal seed, it seems that
this property is inherent in the graph evolution method itself, and
not with the choice of seed.

3.4 DD model yields a better ﬁt than BA with a larger
seed

Having established that with a small seed, DD outperforms BA, we
checked the possibility of using a more complicated seed. It follows
quite easily from the deﬁnition of the two models, that their results
are highly dependent on the initial conditions. We therefore set out
to see whether a better choice of a seed graph will improve the ﬁt
for any of the models.

We only considered seed graphs of up to ~100 nodes. Three
different methods were used for the generation of seed graphs: (i) A
random geometric graph. Here, random points are sampled from a
standardized normal distribution on Rd. Each node corresponds to a
point, and two nodes are connected in the graph if the corresponding
two points are at distance smaller than a parameter ,0. In this model,
the neighbor sets of two connected vertices are positively correlated
(Fig. 4A). (ii) An inverse geometric model, which is similar to the
geometric model, but where two nodes are connected when the
corresponding points are at distance R or above. This model tends
to create large induced initial bipartite graphs (Fig. 4B). (3) An ER
graph: in this model edges are independent of each other (Fig. 4C).

We repeated the previous scheme of ﬁnding the parameters for
both DD and BA. In both cases, the best results were achieved using
the inverse geometric model, possibly due to the large number of
bicliques it inherently contains.

We ﬁnd that for the BA graph, the best parameters are m=6,
d=6 and R=4.25, with a seed size of 110, giving 47 286:l:9092
edges (mean :l: SD). The 12 distance to the real graph is 12.35 :l: 3.08

Shown are number of edges; [2 distance to the yeast PPI graph; and the percentage of
bicliques that fully reside inside the seed. The yeast PPI graph contains 22 118 edges.
12 dist: [2 distance to yeast PPI; BC: bicliques; SD: standard deviation.

(Fig. 3E). Although larger bicliques emerge, only bicliques of
smaller sizes make substantial contributions to the total count.
The BA algorithm does not tend to expand bicliques. Indeed, for
bicliques in the size range of 4 f n f m, the fraction of bicliques that
are already fully contained in the seed graph is 92.9% (Fig. 3G).
It appears then, that in order to achieve a similar distribution of
bicliques, it is crucial to start from an extremely large seed, and
even so, most of the larger bicliques do not expand beyond their
original size in the seed graph.

For the DD graph, the best parameters were found to be
p=0.3 and r=1.05, d=2, R=1.5 with a 40 nodes seed, giving
19463.76:l: 1307.77 edges, close to the number of edges in the real
PPI network. Here, the 12 distance to the real graph is signiﬁcantly
smaller: 7.15:l: 1.90 (Fig. 3F).

Compared with its BA counterpart, only 5.1% of bicliques in
the range 4§n§m reside ﬁilly inside the seed (Fig. 3H). This is
in agreement with the observation that the majority of subgraphs
are generated in the duplication process. Thus, a much closer
distribution is achieved, with a smaller seed graph, and much more
of the graph structure is generated by the process rather than being
embedded in the seed. A comparison of the different statistics for
the BA and DD models is shown in Table 1.

4 DISCUSSION

The proper modeling of PPI networks is a major challenge from two
perspectives: the theoretical—mathematical and the biological one.

In the search for the best model to explain experimental data, one
should be aware of several pitfalls originating in the methodology
or in the data itself.

A key source of difﬁculty is the quality of available data. In
particular, PPI data originate from several different sources of
varying levels of quality and reliability. The systematic curation of
such data provides at least a partial remedy. Much of the yeast PPI
network information originates from Y2H experiments. This method
suffers from a high false positive rate (Bader and Hogue, 2002;
Uetz et al., 2000). However, with advances in experimental design
(Vermeulen et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2008), consistently contaminating
proteins are more easily eliminated. Thus, the quantity, quality and
reliability of PPI networks have drastically improved (Yu et al.,
2008). In addition, large-scale co-immunoprecipitation experiments
allow the incorporation of labile protein interactions into PPI
networks (Schulze and Mann, 2004).

To test the validity of our conclusions, we have repeated the
described protocol by omitting the Y2H data, leaving >50% of the
data, mainly extracted from co-immunoprecipitation experiments,
and from X-ray and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in
cell culture (SILAC)-based tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation (TAP)
technologies. This subset shows essentially the same results.

We use the distribution of maximal bicliques in a graph as a
yardstick against which to compare different generative models of
graphs. We have investigated the PPI network of S.cerevisiae. It
transpires that the graphs generated by the DD model are in much
better agreement with the actual network than those generated by
the BA model. Clearly, both models can be expanded and reﬁned
in various ways, and we have restricted ourselves to the basic
versions of either model. In addition, other models may also be
suggested. Indeed, other closely related models have also been
shown to give rise to many large bicliques (Kumar et al., 2000).
Still, we believe that our ﬁndings are rather indicative of the general
picture.

In conclusion, we have suggested a new perspective on the
question of PPI network modeling. The distribution of maximal
bicliques is not only an intuitive method to distinguish between
models, but also effective and decisive. Our results, based on the
biclique perspective, conclusively show the ability of the DD model
to capture a key essence of PPI networks.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) aim to
identify genetic susceptibility to complex diseases by assaying and
analyzing hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs). Although traditional single-locus statistical tests have
identified many genetic determinants of susceptibility, those
findings cannot completely explain genetic contributions to complex
diseases. Marchini and coauthors demonstrated the importance
of testing two-locus associations allowing for interactions through
a wide range of simulation studies. However, such a test is
computationally demanding as we need to test hundreds of billions
of SNP pairs in GWAS. Here, we provide a method to address this
computational burden for dichotomous phenotypes.

Results: We have applied our method on nine datasets from
GWAS, including the aged-related macular degeneration (AMD)
dataset, the Parkinson’s disease dataset and seven datasets from
the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). Our method
has discovered many associations that were not identified before.
The running time for the AMD dataset, the Parkinson’s disease
dataset and each of seven WTCCC datasets are 2.5, 82 and 90h
on a standard 3.0GHz desktop with 4G memory running Windows
XP system. Our experiment results demonstrate that our method
is feasible for the full-scale analyses of both single- and two-locus
associations allowing for interactions in GWAS.

1 INTRODUCTION

In genetics, it has been well established that single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with a variety of diseases.
In the emerging genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the
goal is to identify genetic susceptibility through assaying and
analyzing SNPs at the genome-wide scale. While the analysis of
susceptibility of individual SNPs has been standardized and led to

many interesting ﬁndings, these ﬁndings cannot completely explain
the genetic causes of complex diseases. Consequently, identifying
two-locus association patterns of complex diseases has attracted
more attentions (Marchini et al., 2005). In general, SNP association
patterns in the two-locus association study can be partitioned into
four classes based on the different combinations of main effects and
interaction effects, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Current works focus on ﬁnding SNPs in Classes I, II and III.
As a result, many genetic determinants of susceptibility have
been mapped. Two recent reviews (Balding, 2006; Cordell, 2009)
presented the detailed analyses on many popular methods, including
traditional single-locus-based statistical tests (Balding, 2006) and
multi-locus analysis methods, such as the ones implemented in
PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007), multifactor dimensionality reduction
(MDR) (Ritchie et (11., 2001), Tuning ReliefF (Moore and White,
2007), Random Jungle (Schwarz et (11., 2010) and BEAM (Zhang
and Liu, 2007).

However, their ﬁndings cannot completely explain genetic
contributions to complex diseases. Many researchers expect to detect
more meaningful results by studying SNPs in Class IV. Although
these SNPs neither display strong main effects nor signiﬁcantly
interact with other loci, some of them may inﬂuence diseases
via the combination of main effects and interaction effects. This
is referred to as two-locus associations allowing for interactions
(formal deﬁnition in Section 2). Marchini et al. (2005) demonstrated
the importance of testing associations allowing for interactions
through a wide range of simulation studies. From a mathematical
point of View, testing associations allowing for interactions enables
us to detect a particular subset of SNPs in Class IV. We categorize
this set as Class V in Figure l, which is of our interests in this work.

While various methods have been proposed to test two-locus
associations allowing for interactions [see the recent review
(Cordell, 2009)], most of them fail to handle hundreds of billions of
SNP pairs in GWAS. The main difﬁculty is the heavy computational
burden. For example, in order to detect associations allowing for
pairwise interactions from 500 000 SNPs, we need more than
1011 statistical tests. Some progress has been made on this issue
recently. Marchini et al. (2005) showed that it was computationally
intensive but still possible to test two-locus associations allowing
for interactions in GWAS. BEAM (Zhang and Liu, 2007) is another
feasible method to detect associations allowing for interactions
in the genome-wide scale. Zhang and Liu (2007) proposed a
Bayesian marker partition model and used Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) sampling to optimize the posterior probability of
the model. BEAM has successfully demonstrated its capability of
handling large datasets using the synthetic data. But it did not provide
convincing evidence using the real data. When the authors applied
BEAM to analyze an aged-related macular degeneration (AMD)
dataset consisting of 116204 SNPs and 146 samples (Klein et al.,
2005), neither main effects nor interaction effects were reported
by BEAM based on its B-statistic test. For many larger datasets
such as those from Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium
(WTCCC), BEAM is only feasible after a ﬁltering stage based on
the single-locus test (Cordell, 2009).

Here, we provide a computational method to address this issue.
We show that testing two-locus associations allowing forinteractions
of all SNP pairs in GWAS can be done in a fast manner. We
also demonstrate the statistical power of our method on simulated
datasets and the applicability of our method on nine real GWAS
datasets including the AMD dataset (Klein et al., 2005), the
Parkinson’s disease dataset (Fung et al., 2006) and seven datasets
from WTCCC (WTCCC, 2007). Our method discovers some
associations that were not identiﬁed before. Currently, we only focus
on ﬁnding two-locus associations allowing for interactions in case-
control studies. We do not search for higher order interactions due
to the following reasons:

(1) To detect strong interactions between SNPs with weak
main effects (or even in the absence of main effects),
the exhaustive search is needed. Evaluating all pairs has
already imposed a computational challenge. The brute-force
search for higher order interactions will be computationally
prohibitive. Heuristic strategies have to be applied but without
guaranteed performance.

(2) Sample size is another issue for detecting higher order
interactions. For a d-order interaction, the contingency table

has 3‘1 X 2 cells. Due to the limited sample size, there will
be many empty (or close to empty) cells, which will lead to
unstable estimation (large variance). This instability makes
the identiﬁed result difﬁcult to be reproduced by other
independent studies.

In the following sections, we ﬁrst provide a formal deﬁnition of
testing two-locus associations allowing for interactions. Then we
describe our test statistics based on log-linear models. We show that
our proposed test statistics can be evaluated analytically. Based on
these test statistics, we develop a stepwise strategy to detect both
single- and two-locus associations allowing for interactions. The
type I error of the proposed strategy is validated through the null
simulation study.

2 METHODOLOGY

2.1 Notation

Suppose a dataset includes [1 SNPs and n samples. X] is used to
denote the l-th SNP, l: 1, ...,£ and Y is the class label (Y=l for
cases and Y :2 for controls). SNPs are bi-allelic genetic markers.
In general, capital letters (e.g. A, B, ...) denote major alleles and
lowercase letters (e.g. a, b, ...) denote minor alleles. For each SNP,
there are three genotypes: homozygous reference genotype (AA),
heterozygous genotype (Aa) and homozygous variant genotype (aa).
The popular way of coding the genotype data is to use {1, 2, 3} to
represent {AA, Aa, aa}, respectively.

2.2 Deﬁnition of two-locus associations allowing for
interactions

There are two types of associations allowing for interactions. One

is partial association allowing for interaction and the other full

association allowing for interaction.

2.2.1 Two-locus partial association allowing for interaction The
two-locus partial association allowing for interaction measures the
association effect of a given locus XI, allowing for the interaction
with another locus Xq. The likelihood ratio test is often used to test
such associations. It involves three steps:

(1) Fit a full logistic regression model deﬁned in Equation (1) to
measure the full association between (Xp, Xq) and the class

label Y and obtain the maximum log-likelihood value 121:.
P(Y=1|Xp =i,Xq :1)
02% m —50 +5Xp=z +5Xq=1 (1)
+ﬂX,,=zyX,=j
Here, ﬁx” =l- represents the coefﬁcient of XI, at category i. The
meaning of ﬂxpzi and ﬂxpziﬁxqzj are similar.

(2) Fit a logistic regression model deﬁned in Equation (2)
to measure the main effect of Xq and obtain maximum
log-likelihood value EM.

P(Y =1|Xq =j)

Ogm =50+5Xq=j (2)

(3) Calculate the P-value using the X2 test on the value of 2-
(L1: —LM) with degree of freedom df =6.

2.2.2 Two-locus ﬁlll association allowing for interaction The
two-locus full association allowing for interaction measures the
association effect of two loci XI, and Xq allowing for the interaction
between them. The corresponding likelihood ratio test is conducted
as the following steps:

(1) Fit a full logistic regression model deﬁned in Equation (1)
and obtain the maximum log-likelihood value LF.

(2) Fit a null logistic regression model deﬁned in Equation (3)
and obtain the maximum log-likelihood value Lg.

(3) Calculate the P-value using the X2 test on the value of 2-
(L1: —Lg) with degree of freedom df = 8.

These likelihood ratio tests based on logistic regressions are
widely accepted. However, it is computationally demanding to
evaluate hundreds of billions of SNP pairs in GWAS by directly
using these tests. Therefore, faster test procedures without losing
statistical powers are needed in GWAS. Noticing the equivalence
between a logistic regression model and its corresponding log-
linear model in categorical data analysis (Agresti, 2002; Wan et al.,
2010), here we propose to test two-locus associations allowing for
interactions based on log-linear models. The advantage of so doing
is that test statistics can be derived in the closed form.

2.3 Log-linear models

Given two loci XI, and Xq, a contingency table of (Xp, Xq) and
Y will be used (Table l) to test two-locus associations allowing
for interactions. The size of the contingency table is I X] ><K with
I = 3, J = 3 and K :2. In the contingency table (shown in Table l),
we use nl-jk to denote the observed count in the cell (i, j, k), which is a
realization of a random variable Nl-jk assumed as Poisson distributed
in log-linear models. Although Poisson distribution may not be
entirely suitable for the ﬁxed sample size, it is still considered as
a reasonably good approximation to a multinomial model. Such an
approximation makes the mathematics tractable.

Clearly, we have n=Zis j, knijk. We use nl-jk to denote the
probability that an observation falls in the cell (i, j, k). A natural

constraint of nl-jk is
Zﬂijk = l. (4)

i,j,k

Therefore, the expectation of Nl-jk is

Mijk =mTijk- (5)
The likelihood function is

iﬁjﬁk 11k

Correspondingly, the log-likelihood function is

L(ﬂ)=Z[nijk10g(szk)—szk —Iog(n.-jk!>]. (7)
i,j,k

In the space of log-linear models, the saturated model matches
the full logistic regression model [deﬁned in Equation (1)]; the
partial independence model is the equivalent form of the logistic
regression model with only main effects [deﬁned in Equation (2)];
and the block independence model corresponds to the null logistic
regression model [deﬁned in Equation (3)]. In the following, we ﬁrst
explain these three log-linear models and how they connect to the
corresponding logistic regression models. Then, we describe how to
test two-locus associations allowing for interactions using log-linear
models.

We use the dot convention to indicate summation over a subscript,
e.g. 71,-" =Zj’krrl-jk is the marginal probability of Xp=i and niu =
Zjﬁk nijk is the number of observations with X], =i. Similarly,
we have 71.]; =Ziﬁknijk, n]; = Ziﬁk nl-jk, Truk =Ziﬁjnijk and nuk =
Ziﬁj nl-jk. The notation extends to two dimensions as well. For
example, Tl'ij. =Zk nl-jk is the marginal probability of Xp=i and
Xq =j, and nil; = 2k nl-jk is the corresponding count.

2.3.1 Saturated model The saturated model M 3 deﬁnes the joint
distribution with all factors. The hypothesis is

S. S _ ”
H0 .rrljk —Tl'l]k.
The saturated log-linear model is

IOgMijk =A+Axp=i+lxq=j+ly=k+AX,,=i,X,=j (8)
+AX,=i, Y=k +AX,=j, Y=k + AX,,=i,X,=j, Y=k-

Please note that once the sample size is ﬁxed and the ratio between
cases and controls is ﬁxed, the model given in Equation (8) only has
degree of freedom df :8 even though there are 18 coefﬁcients in
the model.

Using Equation (7), the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
of Milk in Equation (8) is

2.3.2 Partial independence model The partial independence
model Mp factorizes the joint distribution nl-jk with the assumption
that Xq is independent of the class label Y if X], is given. The
hypothesis is

2.4 Connection between log-linear models and logistic
models

For brevity, we use the partial independence model Mp to show
the equivalence between a log-linear model and its corresponding
logistic model. The logit based on the partial independence model
M p is
P(Y=1|Xp=i,Xq=j)
0g P(Y=2|Xp=i,Xq =j)

- (A +Axp=i + qu=j + AY=2 +AX,,=i,X,=j +AX,=i, Y=2)
=(AY=1—AY=2)+(AX,=i,Y=1—AX,,=i,Y=2)-

The ﬁrst term is a constant which does not depend on i or j. The
second term only depends on the category i of Xp. Therefore, this
logit has the following form

OgP(Y=1|Xp = i,Xq =j)
P(Y=2|Xp=i,Xq =j) (15)

=ﬁo+ﬁxp=zw

Clearly, this is equivalent to the logistic regression model with only
main effects deﬁned in Equation (2).

Using the same inference shown above, it is straightforward to
ﬁnd the connection between the saturated model MS and the full
logistic regression model deﬁned in Equation (1) and the connection
between the block independence model MB and the null logistic
regression model deﬁned in Equation (3).

2.5 Testing two-locus associations allowing for
interactions using log-linear models

Based on the equivalence between the log-linear model and its
corresponding logistic regression model, we construct our test
statistics based on the partial independence model Mp, the saturated
model M S and the block independence model M B. Let 1:13, 1:5 and 133
be the log-likelihood of Mp, M S and MB evaluated at their MLEs,
respectively.

Equations (9, 11 and 13)], the test statistics can be quickly computed.
This enables us to detect two-locus associations allowing for
interactions in GWAS in a fast manner.

2.6 A stepwise strategy to detect two-locus associations
allowing for interactions

We develop a stepwise method to detect two-locus associations
allowing for interactions in GWAS. It involves the following steps.

0 Step 1: for all of [I SNP markers, we test the main effects
using the likelihood ratio test. The details are given in the
Supplementary Material. We determine the signiﬁcance of main
effects based on the Bonferroni correction of [1 tests.

0 Step 2: for those SNPs without signiﬁcant main effects, we
check every pair (Xp, Xq) and evaluate its association under
the following three models:

(a) Compute the statistic for X1, association allowing for
the interaction with Xq using Equation (18), where 
and  are calculated using Equations (9) and (11),
respectively.

(b) Compute the statistic for Xq association allowing for the
interaction with XI, similarly.

Detecting two-locus associations

 

(0) Compute the full association statistic using Equation (19),
where  and  are calculated using Equations (9) and
(13), respectively.

(d) Compute Bayesian information criterions (BICs) for all
three models and choose the best one to conduct the X2
test with degree of freedom df :6 (partial association) or
df :8 (full association). In statistics, the BIC or Schwarz
criterion (Schwarz, 1978) is a criterion for model selection
and it provides a measure to favor one model over another.
The Bonferroni correction is applied for £(£ — 1)/ 2 tests.

The model selection in (d) of Step 2 is critical. Marchini et al. (2005)
did not consider this issue. According to our simulation results,
ignoring the model selection would result in an unexpected high
type I error rate (see our experimental result in Section 3.2).

3 RESULTS

In this section, we evaluate our proposed method using both
simulation data and real data. It is also instructive to compare the
empirical power of our method with some recent approaches. In
Cordell (2009), BEAM was recommended as a very powerful one
which could handle large-scale data and ﬁnish in a reasonable period
of time. In addition, BEAM has been compared with MDR, the
stepwise logistic regression and the logic regression (Zhang and
Liu, 2007). BEAM outperforms all of them. Therefore, we focus
on the comparison between our method and BEAM using simulated
data generated from four popular epistatic models and nine real
datasets, one from the AMD study (Klein et al., 2005), one from the
Parkinson’s disease study (Fung et al., 2006) and the other seven
datasets from WTCCC. We also conduct the typical single-locus
analysis (the details of our single-locus analysis are provided in
Supplementary Section 1) and use its performance as the reference
to display the improvement that the two-locus association analysis
can achieve. To check the type I error of our method, we further
design a null simulation study.

3.1 Simulation experiment from four epistasis models

In this experiment, we select four epistasis models whose odds tables
are given in the Supplementary Material. Model 1 is a multiplicative
model considered in Marchini et al. (2005). Model 2 is discussed
in Neuman and Rice (1992) to describe handedness (Levy and
Nagylaki, 1992)1 and the color of swine (Lerner, 1968). Model 3 is
discussed in Li and Reich (2000) and Frankel and Schork (1996).
Model 4 is the well-known XOR model. For each dataset, we
generate genotype data based on the Hardy—Weinberg principle. We
set the MAFs of disease-associated SNPs as 0.2 and 0.4. We generate
the MAFs of unassociated SNPs uniformly from [0.05, 0.5]. The
parameters of each model for each setting are calculated based on
the prespeciﬁed disease prevalence p(D) and the genetic heritability
h2 (please see details in the Supplementary Material). We simulate
100 datasets under each setting for each disease model. Each dataset
contains 1000 SNPs. To take sample sizes into consideration, we
generate 800 and 1600 samples with the balanced design.

The performance comparison of three methods is provided in
Supplementary Figure 2 with the signiﬁcance thresholds selected as

more (e.g. Vuoksimaa at al., 2009).

thresholds

0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 after the Bonferroni correction. It exactly matches
the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the four disease models
(Supplementary Fig. 1). The total variance of simulation models is
decomposed into two parts: the variance explained by main effects
and the variance explained by interactions. The performances of
the single-locus analysis and BEAM are expected to be consistent
as what ANOVA indicates. Speciﬁcally, when main effects are
noticeable, they perform reasonably well. When interaction effects
dominate, they perform poorly. For all models, our method has a
higher power on average because each model has an interaction
effect. For Models 1 and 3 with MAF = 0.2, BEAM outperforms
our method because the generated datasets contain noticeable main
effects in those settings. The MCMC used in BEAM has a high
chance to sample simulated true pairs if main effects are present.
The B-statistic used in BEAM often has a higher power than the
statistic used in the likelihood ratio test as demonstrated in Zhang
and Liu (2007). However, for other settings with weak main effects,
our method outperforms BEAM. The sample size plays an important
role for all methods. The power increases a lot when the sample size
increases from n: 800 to 1600.

3.2 Null simulation to test type I errors

To display type I errors of our method, we conduct the null
simulation experiments. We generate 1000 null datasets. Each
dataset consists of 1000 SNPs and 1000 samples. All SNPs
are simulated independently with MAFs uniformly distributed in
[0.05,0.5]. We conduct two experiments on those null datasets,
one using BIC in model selection and the other one without using
BIC. The experiment results are provided in Table 2, from which
we can see that the type I errors of our method using BIC agree
with the nominal error rates while the numbers of false positives
without using BIC are much higher. This results show that our model
selection strategy plays an essential role in controlling the type I error
at nominal error rate.

3.3 Experiment on the AMD dataset

AMD is a disease associated with aging that gradually destroys
central vision. The AMD study (Klein et al., 2005) genotyped
116 204 SNPs on 96 cases and 50 controls. We ﬁrst apply the
similar quality control process as suggested in Klein et al. (2005)
and keep 82 14-4 SNPs. Klein et al. (2005) reported two signiﬁcant
loci, rs380390 and rs1329428, based on the allelic association with
degree of freedom df = 1. In our single-locus analysis, these two loci
are not signiﬁcant based on the genotype association with degree
of freedom df=2. Their unadjust P-values are 1.75 X 10‘6 and
3.64 X 10T6. BEAM also did not detect these two SNPs because
its B-statistic was used with degree of freedom df :2 (Zhang and
Liu, 2007). However, both our single-locus test and BEAM ranked
them as the top two.

BEAM did not report any interactions in this dataset, while
our method discovered a partial association between AMD and

the small number of samples, the odds ratios cannot be reliably
estimated. Therefore, we only provide their genotype distributions
in the Supplementary Material. It is not surprising that BEAM does
not report this SNP pair. The unadjusted single-locus P-values of
rs994542 and rs9298846 are 0.009 and 0.723, respectively. BEAM
is unlikely to pick up these SNPs during its MCMC iterations.
How these two SNPs jointly contribute to the disease trait or
whether they are tagging ungenotyped functional loci is under
further investigation.

3.4 Experiment on the Parkinson’s disease dataset

Parkinson’s disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that often
impairs the motor skills, speech and other functions of the patients.
Fung et al. (2006) genotyped 396 591 SNPs in 22 autosomes of
541 samples. In their study, they did not identify any signiﬁcant
association using the single-locus test. BEAM was applied to
analyze this dataset and did not report any association. Our method
identiﬁes a partial two-locus association involving SNP rs10519435
interacting with SNP rs849523. The P-value of this association
is 0.061 after the Bonferroni correction. These two SNPs have
high-genotyping quality with only one missing genotype.

The joint distributions of these two SNPs in cases and controls and
the corresponding odds ratios are provided in Figure 3, Table 3 and
Table 4 in the Supplementary Material. The genotype combinations
‘CC/ ’, ‘CT/AG’ and ‘TT/AG’ have signiﬁcantly higher odds
ratios than others genotype combinations. Please note that the
signiﬁcantly higher disease risk of ‘CT/AG’ is supported by larger
counts in both cells than ‘CC/AA’ and ‘TT/AG’ (see details in the
Supplementary Material). In addition, the genotype ‘CT/AA’ has
a signiﬁcantly low disease risk. SNP rs10519435 resides at the
intron of gene LVRN (laeverin). Its neighbor gene SNCAIP has been
strongly associated with the Parkinson’s disease (Engelender et al.,
2000). SNP rs849523 resides at the intron of gene Neuropilin-2
(NRP2) which is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
receptor. It is a well-known gene associated with many cancers. The
ligands of NRP2 are Class-3 semaphorins. In the nervous system,
altered semaphorin function has been linked to Alzheimer’s disease,
motor neuron degeneration, schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease
(Williams et al., 2007). To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst identiﬁed
association that can pass the statistical signiﬁcance test for the study
(Fung et al., 2006). Although it is still unclear whether and how
these genes jointly affect disease traits, this ﬁnding provides a clue
to further analyze the dataset.

3.5 Experiments on seven datasets from WTCCC

The WTCCC is a collaboration of many British research groups. In
the ﬁrst phase, the WTCCC has examined the genetic signals (500K
SNPs) of seven common human diseases: bipolar disorder (BD),
coronary artery disease (CAD), Crohn’s disease (CD), hypertension
(HT), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2
diabetes (T2D) (14 000 cases in total and 3000 shared controls).
Before we run our method on these datasets, we ﬁrst apply a
similar quality control procedure as suggested in (WTCCC, 2007)
to preprocess the data. The numbers of remaining SNPs are roughly

T1: the threshold of Bonferroni-corrected P-value is 0.10; T2: the threshold of
Bonferroni-corrected P-value is 0.20; T3: the threshold of Bonferroni-corrected P-value

constraint is used to avoid interactions that might be attributed to the LD effect (Cordell,
2009).

360 000 (see details in the Supplementary Material). BEAM2 cannot
directly handle these datasets in current stage unless a single-locus
test is used to ﬁlter out the SNPs with weak marginal effects based on
their single-locus P-values (Cordell, 2009). In contrast, our method
has discovered many associations that were not identiﬁed before.

The numbers of identiﬁed two-locus associations under three
statistical signiﬁcance thresholds with and without the distance
constraint for seven diseases are reported in Table 3. The distance
constraint is used to avoid associations involving two closely
placed loci because the interaction effects in those associations may
be attributed to the linkage disequilibrium (LD) effect (Cordell,
2009). Since people are more interested in associations induced
by interactions between distantly placed loci and the signiﬁcance
threshold of 0.10 is widely accepted, we focus on the analysis
of two-locus associations allowing for interactions under the
threshold of Bonferroni-corrected P-value of 0.10 with the distance
constraint. The details of these associations (including the statistical
signiﬁcance of single P-values and interaction P-values) are listed
in the Supplementary Material.

3.5.1 RA All loci in the identiﬁed three two-locus associations
are located at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region
in Chromosome 6. The MHC region has been conﬁrmed as the
most variable region in the human genome with respect to infection,
inﬂammation, autoimmunity and transplant medicine (Lechler and
Warrens, 2000). The recent study (W TCCC, 2007) has replicated
the strong association between gene HIA-DRBI and RA via single-
locus association mapping. Our result further replicates another
strong association between gene HLA-B and the disease trait, which
was previously reported in (Galocha and de Castro, 2008). The
identiﬁed association involves the locus rs4394275 interacting with
the locus rs9276440. The P-value of this association is 0.059
after the Bonferroni correction. The locus rs4394275 resides at the
intron region of gene HLA-B and the locus rs9276440 resides at
the intron region of gene HIA-DQAZ. Both genes are located at
the MHC region and have shown strong associations with RA in
many studies (Galocha and de Castro, 2008; Vignal et al., 2009).
Our results further provide the evidence that these two genes may
contribute to the etiology of RA.

 

2The current version of BEAM cannot handle datasets with ~500K SNPs
and ~5000 samples. In Wan at al. (2010), we tested BEAM by loading one
chromosome at a time and then assembling the results together.

Fig. 2. The identiﬁed two interesting association regions. (a) The region 30 010ke30 065k of Chromosome 6. The recombination rate and LD plot from
HapMap show that a block structure spans from 30 010k to 30 065k. (b) The region 28 160ke28 300k of Chromosome 6. The recombination rate and LD plot
from HapMap show that a block structure exists from 28 160ke28 300k. The genotyped loci in our identiﬁed associations in both regions are marked in the
ﬁgure. Many genes including HLA-A genes and ZNF genes in these two regions have shown strong associations with TlD [see a detailed review (Pociot and

McDermott, 2002)].

3.5.2 TID Most identiﬁed associations (except one locus
rs7704018 in Chromosome 5, which is not well studied) from the
T1D datasets are linked with the MHC region. Previous reports
(Nejentsev et al., 2007; WTCCC, 2007) have identiﬁed strong
associations between many MHC genes (such as HLA-DQBI and
HIA-DRBI) and T1D using the single-locus test. However, it is
unclear which and how many loci within the MHC region determine
T1D susceptibility. Our results provide additional information to
help pinpoint disease-associated loci because SNPs involved in those
associations are usually ﬁltered out in the single-locus test. A further
inspection of the 266 associations of our interest has identiﬁed two
association regions which span from 30 010k bases to 30 065k bases
and from 28 160k bases to 28 300k bases. Both regions are illustrated
in Figure 2. Many genes including HLA-A genes and ZNF genes in
these two regions have shown strong associations with T1D [see a
detailed review in Pociot and McDermott (2002)]. Our ﬁnding may
provide some new insights in studying the causes of T1D.

3.5.3 T2D Only two associations allowing for interactions are
identiﬁed in the T2D dataset. One suspicious association involves
the locus rs9586155 interacting with the locus rs7031174. The P-
value of this association is 0.06 after the Bonferroni correction.
The locus rs9586155, located at the region q33.1 in Chromosome
13, is not well studied. Nor is it in the HapMap collection. The
locus rs7031174 resides at the intron of gene MELK. MELK has
been found signiﬁcantly over-expressed in the great majority of
breast cancer cells (Lin et al., 2007). It is well known that there
are strong associations between T2D and breast cancer, and the
insulin resistance has been connected to an increased risk of breast
cancer (Michels et al., 2003). Although breast cancer occurs mainly
in women and thus this evidence may not indicate a direct connection
between T2D and gene MELK, the investigation of genes interacting
with gene MELK may help identify the causes of T2D.

3.5.4 CD Among the nine associations identiﬁed from the CD
dataset, we have not found strong evidences to relate them with the
disease trait. However, using the LD analysis helps us identify a well-
studied gene ANTXR2. One identiﬁed association involves the locus
rs10008294 interacting with the locus rs1450526. The P-value of
this association is 0.042 after the Bonferroni correction. The locus
rs10008294 is linked with the loci rs4312703 and rs10049995 of
gene ANTXR2. The r2 between rs 10008294 and rs4312703 is 0.933
and the D/ is 0.966. The r2 between rs10008294 and rs10049995
is 0.93 and the D/ is 0.964. Both rs4312703 and rs10049995 are
included in the analysis. However, they are not in the identiﬁed
associations. Gene ANTXR2 encodes a receptor for anthrax toxin
and mutations in this gene cause juvenile hyaline ﬁbromatosis and
infantile systemic hyalinosis.

3.6 Computation time

From a practical point of view, a key issue of two-locus association
analysis in GWAS is the computational efﬁciency (Cordell, 2009).
BEAM is arecent method which can handle large-scale data. BEAM
took about 8 days to handle 47 727 SNPs genotyped on around 5000
samples using 5 X 107 MCMC iterations. A rough estimation implied
that BEAM would take approximately 5 weeks to analyze 89294
SNPs genotyped on those 5000 samples (Cordell, 2009). Currently,
BEAM fails to handle 500 000 to 1 000 000 SNPs genotyped on 5000
or more samples.

Our method makes a signiﬁcant progress in computational time. It
evaluates two-locus associations allowing for interactions of all pairs
of about 360 000 SNPs (i.e. 6.5 X 1010 pairs) within 90h (within 4
days) on a stande desktop (3 .0 GHz CPU with 4G memory running
Windows XP professional x64 Edition system). A detailed running
time comparison given in Table 4 shows that our method is roughly
20—70 times faster than BEAM. The ongoing WTCCC phase 2 study

is analyzing over 60 000 samples of various diseases, which are
genotyped on about one million SNPs using either the Affymetrix
v6.0 chip or the Illumina 660K chip. The shared control samples
will increase from 3000 to 6000. Such a growth in number of SNPs
and sample size becomes even more demanding on the computation
efﬁciency. Our new method should be useful in the analyses of new
datasets.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The development of our method is triggered by the limitations
of existing works on detecting two-locus associations allowing
for interactions from GWAS. Our method shares the same goal
with Marchini’s method (Marchini et al., 2005). Both methods
take interaction effects into account when detecting two-locus
associations. Compared with Marchini’s method, the novelties of
our method are as follows:

0 We develop a stepwise strategy to detect signiﬁcant two-locus
associations allowing for interactions. Our stepwise strategy
involves three models: one full model and two partial models.
Marchini’s method only considers the full model.

0 We use BIC to choose the best model among the three models
to test two-locus associations allowing for interactions. This
model selection process is critical to control the type I error.

0 Instead of working with logistic regression, we make use of the
analytical solutions of some log-linear models, i.e. Equations
(11, 9 and 13), so that the test statistics can be obtained in the
closed form.

We have applied our method to analyze many datasets from
GWAS and identiﬁed many undiscovered associations. Our method
displays many advantages over existing methods:

0 It can detect two-locus associations allowing for interactions
from genome-wide data in a fast manner.

0 It does not assume any particular epistasis model. This is
very important for real studies because the patterns of SNP
interactions are generally unknown and could be complex.

0 It can be extended into distributed and parallel computing to
analyze the phase 2 datasets from WTCCC.

One limitation of our method is that it can only detect associations
between two SNPs and disease traits, while BEAM is able to detect
higher order associations as well. There are several other issues that
we have not addressed, such as population substructures, imputation
of the missed genotypes and incorporation of covariates.

In summary, our experiment results demonstrate that our method
is more powerful than existing works in detecting two-locus

associations allowing for interactions. It is also computationally
feasible to test hundreds of thousands of SNPs genotyped in
thousands of samples.

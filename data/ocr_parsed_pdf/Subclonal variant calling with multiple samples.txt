ABSTRACT

Motivation: Targeted resequencing of cancer genes in large cohorts
of patients is important to understand the biological and clinical con-
sequences of mutations. Cancers are often clonally heterogeneous,
and the detection of subclonal mutations is important from a diagnos-
tic point of view, but presents strong statistical challenges.

Results: Here we present a novel statistical approach for calling mu-
tations from large cohorts of deeply resequenced cancer genes.
These data allow for precisely estimating local error profiles and
enable detecting mutations with high sensitivity and speciﬁcity. Our
probabilistic method incorporates knowledge about the distribution of
variants in terms of a prior probability. We show that our algorithm has
a high accuracy of calling cancer mutations and demonstrate that the
detected clonal and subclonal variants have important prognostic
consequences.

Availability: Code is available as part of the Bioconductor package
deepSNV.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, genome sequencing has greatly enhanced our
understanding of cancer biology (Stratton, 2011). Tumors are
evolving entities and display complex clonal architectures with
many mutations present in only a subset of cells (Nik-Zainal
et al., 2012; Yates and Campbell, 2012). Subclonal mutations
provide insights into disease evolution and inﬂuence prognosis
(Landau et al., 2013; Papaemmanuil et al., 2013). Subclonal vari-
ants can be detected using the deep coverage of next-generation
sequencing technologies, but their distinction from sequencing
errors, library preparation and alignment artifacts suffers from
an unfavorable signal to noise level (Gerstung et al., 2012;
Schmitt et al., 2012).

A series of powerful variant callers has been developed in
recent years for calling variants from genome or exome sequen-
cing data of tumorinormal pairs (Cibulskis et al., 2013; Goya
et al., 2010; Larson et al., 2011). For detecting subclonal variants,
or mutations in samples with a low purity, which are both
reported by small fractions of reads only, it is mandatory to
accurately quantify the abundance of sequencing artifacts,

which may otherwise lead to large numbers of false positives.
With increasing numbers of genomic datasets being generated,
it becomes apparent that sequencing artifacts tend to occur in a
systematic way and on speciﬁc sites.

Targeted resequencing experiments, in which a selected set of
candidate genes is resequenced across hundreds or thousands of
samples, are increasingly prepared to evaluate findings from
large-scale sequencing studies. Such datasets present an oppor-
tunity to precisely estimate the distribution of sequencing arti-
facts by aggregating information across samples, rather than
across sites as is commonly done in tumorinormal variant call-
ing. This will help avoid artifacts and likewise enable calling
more variants on sites with lower error rates.

The growing catalogs of somatic mutations in cancer also
make it possible to define genomic loci more likely to be
mutated. Therefore, one may attempt to incorporate this prior
knowledge to facilitate variant calling on mutational hotspots
while remaining conservative on the remaining sites. Hence, a
well-chosen prior will increase sensitivity at a given level of
speciﬁcity.

Here we present a novel approach for detecting clonal
and subclonal variants that exploits the power of a large
sample set for precisely deﬁning the local error rates and which
uses prior information to call variants with high speciﬁcity and
sensitivity.

2 APPROACH

Detecting mutations in deep sequencing data is essentially a
model selection problem: one compares the probability of obser-
ving a given number of reads reporting a base change under a
null model specifying the distribution of sequencing artifacts to
the probability in an alternative model allowing for true variants.
A mutation is called if the probability under the alternative ex-
ceeds that of the null model. A probabilistic framework offers the
ﬂexibility to account for prior information, which can be useful,
as some genes are more likely to be mutated in particular cancers
and there often exist mutational hotspots within a gene. The
approach we present here for modeling the error distribution is
based on the observation that sequencing artifacts are recurrent
on speciﬁc loci. In a large cohort, this allows to define a back-
ground error distribution on each locus, above which true vari-
ants can be called.

Subclonal variant calling

 

3 METHODS

3.1 Statistical framework

To deﬁne a statistical test, we have to parameterize the distributions of
variant allele counts. Let i = 1, . . . , N be the index of one of N samples.
For each position j in the genome and nucleotide k e {A, T, C, G, —}, let
X ,7k, ngk denote the count of that nucleotide in forward and backward
read orientations in sample 1'. Let the coverage be denoted m, and nﬁj,
respectively. For the ease of reading, we omit the indexes i, j and k, unless
a clear distinction is necessary. We model the nucleotide counts to be

distributed by a beta-binomial distribution,

X ~ BetaBin(n, u, p) (1)
A” ~ BetaBin(n’, pf, p).

The parameters p. = Mil-k and p.’ 2 Mg], deﬁne the expected number of
nucleotide counts per read,

Em = Im,
Varm = WU — 10(1 + (n — Up),
The dispersion factor p = pjk (no sample index) deﬁnes the amount of

extra variance, as compared with pure sampling errors; for p = 0, the
model is the usual binomial.

(similar for X’). (2)

      

Variant calling is commonly performed against a matched normal.
Here we construct an aggregate control sample for sample 1' from the
set of all other samples J(i) = {h 7e 1'}, Xijk = Zhe ,0.) X M and
Xiﬂc = Zhelm X2], instead. The latter is justiﬁed if the particular variant
occurs only rarely, or if the set of reference samples J(i) is chosen such
that they are unlikely to contain the variant, e. g. by only selecting samples
with a variant allele frequency (VAF) X ,-/n,- smaller than a predeﬁned
threshold, typically ~10%. We assume that the control counts are also
beta-binomially distributed with mean u = vijk, 11% and coverage

'1 = “ijk = 211610) "th and I" = “2,2. = Diem "hjk’i
X ~ BetaBin(n, v, p)

3
X’ ~ BetaBin(n’, v’, p). ( )

This deﬁnition is consistent with the assumption that the individual
samples are beta-binomially distributed, as long as the dispersion param-
eter p is small. The above parameterization is similar to the deepSNV
algorithm (Gerstung et al., 2012), but uses aggregate control counts X, X’
instead of a single control sample. We ﬁnd that the model realistically
reﬂects the observed distribution of nucleotide counts (Fig. 1a).

We formulate calling variants as a model selection problem. A true
variant will be present on both strands, p. = p], and at a higher frequency
than both background error rates 1), 11’ because it is the sum of the true
allele frequency and the error rate. The null-model is that X and X’ are

Fig. 1. General illustration of our approach. (a) Distribution of observed and expected VAFs across samples. The histograms denote the VAF ﬁg and 0.6
of a recurrent artifact occurring at low frequencies in ~20% of the samples in forward, but not in the reverse orientation. The solid lines denote the
expected distribution based on a beta-binomial model, Equation (1), with mean 130 and 136 deﬁned as the average across all samples with VAF < 10%.
The third histogram denotes the SF3BI K700E variant present at clonal and subclonal frequencies, with the curve denoting the expected frequency

distribution. (b) Heatmap of 1000 nt from ﬁve adjacent bait sets targeting the SF3BI gene in 683 samples. The intensity of each pixel represents VAF of

cytosine, r20, rig, in a given sample (y, left axis) and position (x). If the relative frequency is identical, pixels tend to be black. Curves on the bottom
indicate the error rates 130 and 136 in forward and reverse directions (right y-axis). The black line is the estimated dispersion f). The prior :1 of finding a true
variant is derived from the COSMIC database. Circles are drawn around variants with a posterior P(M0 | D) < 0.5; the area of each circle is proportional
to the VAF. At position 650 resides the K700E hotspot mutation with many variant calls. (c—i) Bayes factors [Equation (7)] as a function of forward (x)

distributed with the same rate as the control counts X and X’ on either
strand, which we assume to contain only errors but no variants. We then
have the two models:

M0: p.21) \/ pfzv’; (4)
M1: u:u’>v,v’.

3.2 Inference

Denoting the data by D = {X , X’, X,X’}, the Bayes factor

Pr(D | M1)/ Pr(D | M0) can be approximated using point estimates:
Pr(D l M0) N Pr(D l 00,125.09 + Pr(D 1120.13.90) — Pr(D l 00. 0;)
Pr(D I Mr) N Pr(D 02.13.17) '

 

(5)

The three terms in the numerator arise from the OR condition of M0,
Equation (4), and denote the probability that the error rates in forward,
the reverse or both orientations are identical. Hence, the third term is
usually small in cases where both allele frequencies my] are different
from the error rates. Note that this approximation is rather strong, but
efﬁcient to compute and works well in real applications. The point esti-
mates are deﬁned in the following way, using the method of moments:

ﬁ=X/n, l3, ZXI/l'l/

ﬂ. = max{(X+ X')/(n + n’), v, v’}

00 = (X + X)/(n + n), 0;, = (X + X’)/(n’ + n’)
120 = X/Vh Iii) = X/"l-

(6)

The symbols 130 and 136 are the error rates across all samples; ﬁg and ﬁg,
are the VAF in forward and reverse orientation for each sample (Fig. 1b).
The likelihood factorizes into Pr(D | n, p], v, v’) = Pr(D | n, p], v, v’) =
Pr(X | p.) Pr(X’ | pl) Pr(X | v) Pr(X’ | 11’); this allows to write the Bayes
factor as
Pr(D lMo) _ Pr(X l 130) Pr(X’ | ﬁ0)Pr(X l 130)
Pr(D IM 1) _ Pr(X | IDPIW I ll) Pr(X | 13)
From 120) PM I 0.) MK I as
Pr(X I ll) Pr(X’ I ll) Pr(X’ | 13’)
Pr(X | 130) Pr(X | 130) Pr(X’ | 130) Pr(X’ | 130)
_ Pr(X | ;2) Pr(X | 13) Pr(X’ | 0.) Pr(X’ | 13’)

 

(7)

 

The value of the Bayes factor P(D | M0)/(D | M1) as a function of X, A”
is illustrated in Figure lcif for different error rates. For a small error rate
of v = v’ 2 104‘, which is found on the majority of sites, only a few
variant alleles lead to a Bayes factor small enough to call a variant.

3.3 Estimating ,0

As this estimator is not guaranteed to yield values in (0,1), we bound it
to [104, 0.1]. Empirically, we found that f) is usually small (Fig. lb).

3.4 Prior data

The posterior probability that M0 is true can be computed by Bayes’
formula:

(1 — JT)P1‘(D | M0)

1— P P
( 21) r1(DlMo)+n r(DIM1) (9)

“(Mr ID) =

= 7r 1*”)
1 + Pr(D l M_o)/PF(D l M?)

We use the probability of the null model M0 because of its similarity to
a P-value in a hypothesis testing scheme and call variants below a certain
threshold Pr(Mo | D) < P0. The parameter :1 = rrjk denotes the prior prob-
abilities that a variant k exists at position j. The prior :1 essentially shifts
the relation between the Bayes factor Pr(D | M0)/ Pr(D | M1) and the pos-
terior probability Pr(Mo | D). A higher prior probability results in a lower
posterior probability of an artifact for a given signal as quantiﬁed by the
Bayes factor (Fig. 1 g).

Prior information about the likelihood of an allele being mutated can
be extracted, for example, from the COSMIC database (Forbes et al.,
2011). We assume that the prior can be written as follows:

njk = 77gch X ﬁjka 
where the histogram

A # mutations k at loccus j
IT ' = +
1k total # mulat1ons 1n gene

(11)

denotes the relative frequency of mutations k at site j in a given gene. The
factor 7rng deﬁnes the probability of a gene being mutated. These prob-
abilities vary greatly between genes and for the same gene also between
different tumor types. As there are currently many systematic studies
being performed, we expect that accurate estimates will be available
soon for many cancers. For all sites not present in COSMIC, we use a
constant value of :1 2 104‘. An example of the prior distribution ob-
tained from COSMIC is shown in Figure lb.

3.5 Implementation

We have implemented the algorithm in the statistical language R (R Core
Team, 2012) and released code as part of the deepSNV Bioconductor
package (31.8) (Gerstung et al., 2012). We named the algorithm ‘shear-
water’ after the seabirds that ﬂy long distances over the ocean, watching
the water closely and eventually dive into the water to pick up prey, often
with prior help from other fish. More information can be found in the
accompanying vignette:

> library (deepSNV)

> vignette( “ sheamater” )

The runtime of 1 kb over 800 samples is ~1 CPU min on a 2.2GHz
AMD processor. This performance is sufﬁcient to process a complete
targeted screen with 100 genes in a few hours on an 8-core machine,
and the algorithm can be parallelized easily.

4 RESULTS

We benchmark our algorithm against data from two large gene
screens in hematological cancers, a subset of 738 patients with
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) we have published recently
(Papaemmanuil et al., 2013). In these screens, 111 cancer genes
were sequenced using barcoded libraries prepared from whole
genome ampliﬁed DNA. Samples were sequenced in batches of
96 per lane on a HiSeq2000 and reads were aligned with bwa
(0.5.9—rl6+rugo) (Li and Durbin, 2010) to the GRCh37
human reference genome. Technical replicates existed for 20

samples with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) assayed by the
same gene panel. Moreover, we included 32 normal samples to
quantify speciﬁcity. Here we focus on a subset of 43 genes with
good coverage and in which we had previously found oncogenic
mutations (Papaemmanuil et al., 2013; Table 1). The availability
of survival data in the MDS cohort allows for evaluating the
quality of variant calls by their prognostic potential, which is
an orthogonal measure to technical replication.

4.1 Simulations and control data

To assess the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of shearwater, we used a
panel of 500 samples, including 32 normals and 2 x 20 AML
replicates. The remaining samples served for deﬁning the
background error distribution and for assessing how reprodu-
cible the calls are. To analyze the sensitivity for different com-
binations of coverage, we simulated mutations at different
variant allele frequencies using the coverage and strand bias of
one of the normal samples (median 128x, 5% 13x, 95% 372x
coverage). For each position j, we drew a vector of variant allele
frequencies for {A, T, C, G, —} from a Dirichlet distribution,
it]- ~ Dir(l, l, l, l, 1). We then sampled reads X]- ~ Mu1t(/Lj, 71]),
X}. ~ Mu1t(/Lj, 71;), where 711- and  are the coverages on forward
and reverse strand as observed in the normal sample. We ran
shearwater on the cohort of 500 samples to compute the Bayes
factors of each simulated variant.

4.1.] Sensitivity The fraction of variants with a Bayes factor
<10’4 for fixed dispersion p is shown in Figure 2a. This cutoff
corresponds to a posterior odds of l, or a cutoff of P0 = 0.5,
under a uniform prior with probability 104. For a coverage of
250x, the true-positive rate of a 5% variant is 70%, and that of a
10% variant is ~85%. Variants present in 20% can be called
almost with certainty. When the dispersion is estimated from the
data using all samples with VAF <10%, the Bayes factors
become larger for variants <10% and only few reach the thresh-
old of 104, as the model starts fitting the distribution of true
calls (Fig. 2b). In this case, a Bayes factor of 10’1 gives rise to a
similar power as in the undispersed case and a stronger prior is
required for a variant to be called.

4.1.2 AUC and cohort size We evaluated the area under the
ROC curve (AUC) as a global measure of predictive accuracy
for different VAF frequencies as a function of cohort size
(Fig. 2c). Typical AUC values range from 60% for 1% variants

to 98% for 50% VAF with only a mild inﬂuence of the cohort
size. A small percentage of variants could not be called with the
experimentally observed coverage.

4.1.3 Specificity As variants in cancer samples are typically rare
and millions of loci are analyzed, specificity is a major concern.
We compared shearwater’s speciﬁcity on 32 normal samples
against three other algorithms: Caveman, an established variant
caller, which has been used in many large-scale genome and exome
sequencing projects (Jones et al., unpublished data; Nik-Zainal
et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2012), MuTect (Cibulskis et al.,
2013) and deepSNV (Gerstung et al., 2012). We ran Caveman
as described against a single unmatched normal sample
(Papaemmanuil et al., 2013). Similarly, we ran MuTect (V.1.1.4)
with default options ——cosmic b37_cosmic_v54_l20

deepSNV (V.1.3.3) were combine.method= ‘ fisher’ and
adjust .method: ‘BH ’ . After calling variants, we ﬁltered the
output by removing variants in Ensembl variation (V70) and
removed unknown polymorphisms with P(V AF >0.5) > 0.1.

In total, shearwater called ﬁve non-polymorphic variants
(Fig. 2d). deepSNV, in contrast, called of 32, Caveman 48 and
MuTect 79 variants. Hence, the speciﬁcity of shearwater appears
satisfying.

4.1.4 Reproducibility To quantify the reproducibility of shear-
water, we evaluated 20 AML samples that had been sequenced in
replicates. Here the second replicate underwent whole-genome
ampliﬁcation, whereas the first replicate did not. The Bayes fac-
tors of replicates are highly correlated (Spearman’s p = 0.87)
with only few samples missing the thresholds for variant calling
(Fig. 2e). The overall overlap of variants called in both replicates
ranges from 80 to >90%, depending on the posterior cutoff
(Fig. 21). This is consistent with an average power of 9&95%.

4.2 Variants in MDS

Here we reanalyze data from 683 MDS samples that were
sequenced in the same run and passed quality control steps.
We used the shearwater algorithm to analyze 258 830 nt from
43 oncogenic genes. For each call, we annotated polymorphisms
present in Ensembl variation (V70) but not in COSMIC (V63) and
termed mutations that were missense, nonsense or splice-site
variants as non-silent.

4.2.] Eﬂect of prior and cutoﬂ First, we assess the inﬂuence of
the prior 7rgene and the cutoff of the posterior probability P0,
below which we call variants. As expected, the number of non-
polymorphic variants calls grows when increasing either the
cutoff of the posterior error probability P0, or the prior odds
ngene / (1 — ngene) (Fig. 3a). As the cutoff P0 affects all sites, it has
a somewhat larger inﬂuence on the number of calls than the
prior, which affects only a small subset of sites.

A stronger prior weight, but not a larger posterior cutoff, leads
to a higher ratio of non-silent to silent non-polymorphic calls
(Fig. 3b), as the prior speciﬁcally enriches for non-coding vari-
ants. The absolute value of N/ S B 1.7 being smaller than the
neutral value of ~3 indicates that there may be some residual
single-nucleotide polymorphisms present in the data
(NSNP/SSNP = 033)-

In the following, we use a prior probability ngene = 0.5 for a
gene to be mutated in our cohort, which seems plausible, given
that we resequenced cancer genes. We use a posterior cutoff of
P0 = 0.5 for our calls, which is the natural Bayes cutoff.

4.2.2 Distribution of calls With these parameters, shearwater
made 20975 calls across all samples, of which 2363 were
unique variants (identical alleles present in multiple samples).
Of these unique variants, 757 were found either in Ensembl vari-
ation or in an in-house panel of 500 normal exomes. Two hun-
dred variants were present in COSMIC, but not in Ensembl
variation, and 1406 were new (Fig. 3c).

The distribution of variant allele frequencies of known poly-
morphisms has two narrow peaks at 0.5 and 1, conﬁrming the
accuracy of allele frequency estimates (Fig. 3d). Non-polymorphic
calls have a broad distribution with typical frequencies ranging

This is consistent with our expectation that more variability
exists at lower frequencies. The distributions of COSMIC and
new variants are similar, which gives us conﬁdence that these
are real. This also indicates that the prior did not lead to overcall-
ing, which would occur specifically at low frequencies.

4.2.3 Comparison with other variant callers We ran Caveman,
MuTect and deepSNV against an unmatched normal as
described above. After ﬁltering variants from Ensembl variation,
576 variants were called by all four approaches (Fig. 3e). One
thousand two hundred ﬁfty-six variants were unique to shear-
water, compared with 360 for Caveman, 1381 for deepSNV and
855 for MuTect. Four hundred ﬁve of 1256 unique variants were
single base deletions, which could not be called by Caveman or
MuTect. It therefore appears that shearwater achieves a good
level of speciﬁcity, given that Caveman used a series of post-
processing filters, whereas deepSNV and MuTect did not.

In the presence of noise, variant calling amounts to balance
sensitivity and speciﬁcity. We evaluated this trade-off by

comparing the ability for calling the SF3BI K700E hotspot mu-
tation, which is characteristic of MDS and can thus be con-
sidered true somatic, versus the overall number of false-positive
calls in the normal panel as discussed in the previous section. All
three variant callers detect 97 K700E variants; above this level,
however, MuTect and Caveman begin to call many artifacts (Fig.
3f). Shearwater calls 108 variants without decreasing specificity
because of the higher prior weight (7rme 2 0.05) put on this
variant. Yet no K700E variants were found in the normal sam-
ples, showing that shearwater does not blindly call this hotspot.

4.3 Prognostic performance

In the absence of a known ground truth and reliable methods for
validating subclonal mutations that are guaranteed not to repli-
cate systematic artifacts, it is generally difﬁcult to assess the qual-
ity of one variant caller over another (Kim and Speed, 2013). An
indirect measure of the quality of a predicted genotype can be the
correlation with a known phenotype, such as survival. Suppose
there exists a correlation C between genotype 0 and a quantita-
tive trait Y. In practice, we do not know the genotype with cer-
tainty, and only have estimates 0 = g + e, where s is the
deviation of the estimate from the truth. If s is 0, the observed
correlation between genotype and phenotype is C = C; if s is
large and completely randomizes Q then the observed correlation
becomes 0. Conversely, a higher correlation between genotype
estimates and phenotype indicates a lower average bias of the
genotype estimates. This reasoning requires the error 8 and the
phenotype Yto be uncorrelated and it appears unlikely to us that
the ability to call mutations is confounded with the outcome of

the patient in such a way that it leads over- and undercalling of

mutations in speciﬁc sets of genes.

4.3.1 Marginal eﬂects of single genes Survival in MDS depends
on the absence and presence of mutations in multiple genes. For
example, we and others have shown previously that oncogenic
mutations in the SF3BI gene are associated with better prognosis
(Damm et al., 2012; Malcovati et al., 2011; Papaemmanuil et al.,
2011), whereas alterations in TP53, DNMT3A, STAG2 and
other genes are indicative of a worse outcome (Papaemmanuil
et al., 2013). Patients with any novel mutations should hence
follow these survival trends.

Survival data were available for 517 patients. We considered a
gene to be mutated if it contained at least one non-silent muta-
tion; the endpoint was AML-free survival. Figure 4a41 shows
KaplaniMeyer curves for patients carrying mutations identiﬁed
by Caveman and/or shearwater. Patients with mutations only
detected by shearwater generally display the expected behav-
iorithat is on average better survival if SF3BI was mutated,
poor survival if TP53 or S TAG2 were mutated and a moderate
change for DNMT3A.

4.3.2 Overall prognostic accuracy To assess the overall prog-
nostic power combining all mutated genes, we trained Cox pro-
portional hazards survival models with mutated genes as
covariates. We used a 5-fold cross-validation scheme to estimate
Harrel’s C—statistic (Harrell et al., 1996), measuring the corres-
pondence of the estimated risk and the ordering of deaths, simi-
lar to an AUC statistic, on the remaining ﬁfth. The predictive
potential C increases with P0 and the prior odds, with typical

values between 0.67 and 0.68 (Fig. 4e). For a prior weight of 100
and P0 = 0.5, C starts dropping again as shearwater starts over-
calling variants with a high prior probability. The maximal value
of C = 0.682 was observed for a cutoff of P0 = 0.5 and a prior
odds of 1, justifying our previous parameter choices.

The C—statistics of shearwater’s competitors were slightly
lower, with Caveman having C: 0.666 and permutations of
the discrepant calls show that this difference is unlikely to be
an artifact (P = 0.03; Fig. 4f). For Mutect we obtained
C = 0.666 (P = 0.02) and deepSNV C = 0.583 (P<0.01).
The higher prognostic accuracy of shearwater suggests that
shearwater calls more survival-associated variants and less noise.

In a practical application, one will most likely rely on a com-
bination of variant callers to avoid the biases of a single method.
Combining the genotypes of different methods by either the
intersection (AND) or the union (OR) of variant calls, however,
did not further increase C (Fig. 4g, h). This indicates that the
variants that shearwater may be missing do not have a large
inﬂuence on survival.

5 DBCUS$ON

In this article, we presented a statistical approach for detecting
clonal and subclonal single nucleotide variants in targeted gene
screens. The availability of large numbers of samples allows for
precisely estimating the rate of artifacts, which is important for
reliably detecting subclonal mutations that can have a disadvan-
tageous signal to noise level. Our model incorporates prior in-
formation on mutational hotspots, which selectively increases the
sensitivity for known mutations. Shearwater automatically deter-
mines the noise levels from the data, and we therefore expect it to
deal well with sequencing data from other sequencing platforms
and aligners.

Shearwater has both a high speciﬁcity and good power to
detect variants. The genotypes obtained by shearwater have a
higher prognostic value than those from established variant call-
ers, and are likely to contain fewer artifacts. To an extent this
behavior is expected because of our algorithm’s ability to exploit
the power of a large cohort of samples and to incorporate prior
knowledge about which mutations are more likely than others.

As our algorithm uses unmatched samples, it relies on the
quality of polymorphism databases such as Single Nucleotide
Polymorphism Database or Ensembl variation, which can gen-
erally be expected to become better in the future. The same holds
true for the quality of databases of somatic mutations that will
get richer over time and contain more precise information about
the mutational patterns in each cancer type. Here we used the
same probability for each gene to be mutated, but once unbiased
estimates for the mutation frequencies in each cancer type exist
from systematic gene screens, one will be able to further improve
the accuracy of our algorithm. The idea of using a prior for
recurrent mutations may also be incorporated easily into other
variant callers.

Finally, our core algorithm may also be improved in many
ways. For example, one could account for base qualities by a
weighted counting scheme, instead of a simple phred quality
threshold. One limitation of our approach is its reliance on a
variant to be present on reads from both directions due to the
speciﬁcs of the null model M0. This was introduced as it greatly

increases the speciﬁcity of calls, but leads to a decrease in power
in regions with low coverage and also at the ﬂanks of the target
regions, where often reads in only one direction are available.
Our implementation allows the user to choose an essentially
strand-agnostic null model M0 : u = v /\ u’ = 1/ , but this may
be less specific. To analyze matched samples, one could derive
the joint probability of a variant being present in only the tumor
but not the normal, or simply remove the intersection of variants
in tumor and matched normal.

In summary, we have presented a coherent statistical method-
ology and robust algorithm for calling subclonal variants in
cancer samples with great speciﬁcity. As genomic sequencing is
about to enter clinical diagnostics, we believe that our method
will have broad applicability.

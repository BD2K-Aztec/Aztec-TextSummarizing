Abstract

Motivation: Figures and tables in biomedical literature record vast amounts of important experi—
ment results. In scientific papers, for example, quantitative trait locus (OTL) information is usually
presented in tables. However, most of the popular text—mining methods focus on extracting know—
ledge from unstructured free text. As far as we know, there are no published works on mining
tables in biomedical literature. In this article, we propose a method to extract OTL information from
tables and plain text found in literature. Heterogeneous and complex tables were converted into a
structured database, combined with information extracted from plain text. Our method could
greatly reduce labor burdens involved with database curation.

Results: We applied our method on a soybean OTL database curation, from which 2278 records
were extracted from 228 papers with a precision rate of 96.9% and a recall rate of 83.3%, Fvalue for

the method is 89.6%.

Availability and implementation: OTLMiner is available at www.soy0mics.com/qtlminer/.

1 Introduction

A quantitative trait locus (QTL) is a region of DNA that is associ-
ated with a particular phenotypic trait, and is important information
for breeding and gene cloning. QTL studies have a long and rich his-
tory; a large number of articles recording the experiment results of
QTL mapping have been published in recent years. To allow re-
searchers to query QTL information easily, several databases have
been developed by manually curating the information scattered in
the literature (Grant et a1. 2010; Monaco et al. 2014). However,
manual curation is labor-intensive work, and it is impossible to
remain current with the rapidly increasing numbers of articles;
consequently, automatic methods are necessary for QTL database
development. Unlike other experiment results, such as genome and
molecular data, QTL information is usually presented in tables,

especially in scientific papers. It is difficult to extract such informa-
tion using traditional text-mining methods that focus on mining
knowledge in unstructured plain text. Although, knowledge hidden
in tables and figures has received increasing attention (Thomas et al.
2010), as far as we know there are only a few works on web table
mining (Wang et a1. 2012; Yang et al. 2002) and no published work
on mining tables in biomedical literature.

In this article, we present a pipeline for automatically mining
QTL information from scientific literature. A flowchart of this
process is shown in Figure 1. We started the process by locating
QTL tables in articles; the tables were then converted into two-
dimensional QTL databases. The Natural Language Process method
was used to extract information that was not presented in
tables, including captions, footnotes and full text. Lastly, content

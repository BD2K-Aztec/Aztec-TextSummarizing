compute Ka, Ks and Ka/Ks values for a list of known homolo—
gous gene pairs. The implementation of gKaKs for a list of hom—
ologous gene pairs can be carried out using the ﬁle with the gene
names of homologous genes pairs, two ‘fasta’ files containing the
reference CDSs and target CDSs and the ‘.gtf/gff ﬁle that
records coordinates of the reference CDSs. Further, one caution
about gKaKs is that the process of BLAT can generate a large
number of gaps if two genomes are highly divergent; therefore,
gKaKs pipeline performs better for comparison of closely related
species with sequence similarity at least 70%. More detail about
gKaKs pipeline is shown in Supplementary Figure S1 and at the
web site http: //longlab .uchicago .ed u/?q=gKaKs.

We tested gKaKs in ﬁve species pairs: human versus chimpan—
zee, mouse versus rat, Drosophila melanogaster versus Drosophila
simulans, Oryza sativa versus Oryza glaberrima, and Arabidopsis
thaliana versus Arabidopsis [yrata (Supplementary Table S1). For
each pair, the former species was treated as the reference genome
of which both the CDSs and the ‘.gff/gtf ﬁle were used. The
latter species was treated as the non—annotated genome of
which only the genome sequences were used. We used genome
sequences from five chromosomes and implemented gKaKs
pipeline for substitution rate estimations. We estimated Ka and
Ks using four methods: codeml (Goldman and Yang, 1994),
yn00 (Yang, 2007), NG (Nei and Gojobori, 1986) and LWL
(Li et al, 1985). The distribution of Ka, Ks and Ka/Ks values
are shown in Supplementary Figure S2. The average Ks values of
these five pair comparisons based on the codeml method are
0.0292, 0.1747, 0.1189, 0.0572 and 0.1394, respectively. The aver—
age Ka values of these ﬁve pair comparisons based on the codeml
method are 0.0097, 0.0250, 0.0146, 0.0180 and 0.0294, respect—
ively. These average Ka and Ks values are consistent with pre—
vious studies (Supplementary Table S2; Andrea et al, 2002;
Hughes and Friedman, 2009; Wolf et al, 2009; Yang and
Gaut, 2011). Based on Ka/Ks, we further identiﬁed genes that
potentially evolved under positive selection (with Ka/Ks>1).
Overall, we identiﬁed 1400 gene pairs in humanwhimpanzee,
172 gene pairs in mouseirat, 137 gene pairs in D.melanogasteri
D.simulans, 4463 gene pairs in 0.5ativw0.glaberrima and 478
gene pairs in A.thalianwA.Iyrata, which might be driven by posi—
tive selection.

To further demonstrate the reliability of gKaKs pipeline, we
estimated the substitution rates of mouse and rat orthologous
genes using alignment from gKaKs and PAL2NAL. PAL2NAL
is one of most popular programs for handling multiple ORF
sequence comparisons and generating output files for down—
stream Ka/Ks calculation. However, PAL2NAL is not conveni—
ent tool to handle large—scale whole—genome sequence data, and
it cannot efﬁciently align pseudogenes with the presences of fra—
meshift and non—sense mutations. We downloaded the mouse
and rat orthologous genes that were annotated by Ensembl
Biomart. We only selected ~14 700 protein—coding ‘one ortholo—
gue to one orthologue’ genes. codeml was used to estimate the
substitution rates for both alignments. As shown in
Supplementary Table S3, estimations between gKaKs and
PAL2NAL are compatible, whereas values from gKaKs are
smaller than those from PAL2NAL. The difference largely
resulted from gKaKs alignment, removing the non—homologous
sequences of the orthologous genes whose substitution rates are
relatively high.

3 CONCLUSION

With the advancements of next—generation sequencing technology,
large numbers of genome sequences are becoming available rap—
idly. Comparative genomics analysis between closely related model
species with well—annotated genomes and non—model species will
provide enormous beneﬁt for functional annotation of non—model
species genomes. gKaKs is a useful tool to compute nucleotide
substitution rates between genes in well—annotated genomes and
their homologous sequences in non—annotated genomes. The re—
sults can (i) be used to compute the level of sequence divergence
between two species through estimating average Ks and substitu—
tion rate; (ii) be used to estimate the number of orthologous/par—
alogous gene pairs under functional constraints or driven by the
positive selection; and (iii) be used as evidence for gene annotation.

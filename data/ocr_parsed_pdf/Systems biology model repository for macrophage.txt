ABSTRACT

Summary: The Macrophage Pathway Knowledgebase (MACPAK)
is a computational system that allows biomedical researchers to
query and study the dynamic behaviors of macrophage molecular
pathways. It integrates the knowledge of 230 reviews that were
carefully checked by specialists for their accuracy and then
converted to 230 dynamic mathematical pathway models. MACPAK
comprises a total of 24 009 entities and 12774 processes and is
described in the Cell System Markup Language (CSML), an XML
format that runs on the Cell Illustrator platform and can be visualized
with a customized Cytoscape for further analysis.

Availability: MACPAK can be accessed via an interactive web site
at http://macpak.csml.org. The CSML pathway models are available
under the Creative Commons license.

1 INTRODUCTION

The immune system has evolved as a defense mechanism against
pathogenic microbes. It consists of both (i) innate immunity,
which is evolutionary ancient and (ii) adaptive immunity, which
provides speciﬁc recognition and immunological memory (Janeway
and Medzhitov, 2002). Cellular participants in the immune
and inﬂammatory responses include antigen-presenting cells and
phagocytic cells, such as macrophages.

Signiﬁcant progress has been made recently in understanding
the biochemical mechanisms by which lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
a bacterial endotoxin which activates immune cells, particularly
macrophages (Miller et al., 2005), leads to sepsis, septic shock
or systemic inﬂammatory response syndrome. LPS is a major
component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and
one of the most potent microbial initiators of inﬂammation (Cohen,
2002). Despite much effort, unfortunately there is no effective
therapy for this problem. It is estimated that ~50 000 people die
each year only in the USA of septic shock or systemic inﬂammatory
syndrome (Guha and Mackman, 2001). Thus, a more detailed
understanding of the molecular mechanisms (pathways) underlying
activation and deactivation of macrophages in response to LPS

becomes crucial for the development of novel therapies (Palsson-
McDermott and O’Neill, 2004).

There are several database resources describing general molecular
pathways, such as BioModels Database (Li et al., 2010), CellML
model repository (Lloyd et al., 2008), JWS Online (Olivier
and Snoep, 2004), Database of Quantitative Cellular Signaling
(Sivakumaran et al., 2002) and SABIO-RK (Rojas et al., 2007).
The main advantage of these resources is that they are databases
which allow simulation of the pathways. On the other hand, some
macrophage-speciﬁc databases are also proposed, such as (Lynn
et al., 2008; Oda et al., 2004) and (Raza et al., 2010). However, to the
best of our knowledge, none of them support simulation. In order to
aid immunologists quest for an effective septic shock treatment, we
present the ﬁrst knowledgebase that is speciﬁcally focused on LPS-
induced macrophage signaling pathways and also allows dynamic
simulation of manually curated macrophage pathways, namely
MACPAK. Here, ‘simulation’ means that one can perform in silico
experiments by changing the parameters of the pathway model, for
example, knocking down one gene, in order to analyze the results
of perturbation before an in vitro or in viva analysis. Therefore,
experiments can be planned and focused in a problem-driven
manner, by predicting the results and consequently, economizing
time, human labor and money.

2 MACPAK

MACPAK contains information retrieved from 230 reviews which
were searched from NCBI PubMed with the expressions LPS and
macrophage, PMA and macrophage (PMA: Phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate) and sometimes including the word monocyte. The
complete list of reports used in this work is summarized at
http://macpak.csml.org/statistics/. Each report was carefully curated
and ‘translated’ to one pathway in an XML format [Cell
System Markup Language (CSML); http://www.csml.org] on Cell
Illustrator. This task was carried out by four researchers for 2 years
and several free softwares were used in order to design the CSML
models (imagemagick http://www.imagemagick.org, subversion
http://subversion.apache.org and trac http://trac.edgewall.org). For
more details about the curation criteria and rules, refer to the manual
(http://macpak.csml.org/about/). During curation, if the quantitative
information (initial concentration and maximum value for biological
entity, order for priority and speed for biological process) are

available then the provided value is used. Otherwise, the quantity is
set to a default value automatically by Cell Illustrator.

Currently, the knowledgebase contains 230 pathways, one for
each review, summing a total of 24 009 entities (i.e. mRNA,
protein, modiﬁed protein and complex), 12 774 processes (binding,
phosphorylation, activation, ubiquitination, for instance) and 39 823
connectors (reactant process and process—product relationship).
Each reaction in this repository is annotated with one or more facts
derived from the original literature as evidence.

Since MACPAK is manually curated (by four researchers
that built, checked and double-checked the CSML models), the
quotations from the original publication can be used as a benchmark
to test and evaluate the performance of text mining tools that try to
reconstruct pathways by using literature information. For example,
consider the following process: PMID: 11257452. In the ‘Facts’
section, there is the sentence ‘Adaptor protein called TAB2 that
mediates activation of TAKl by linking TAKl to TRAF6’. This
sentence was copied and pasted from the corresponding paper and
used by the annotators to construct the CSML model. Therefore,
text mining researchers can evaluate their methods using these
‘Facts’ (texts) as inputs and evaluate the performance by comparing

the output of their methods with the CSML models that can be
downloaded for non-commercial use under the Creative Commons
license.

In order to access each macrophage pathway, the user only needs
to input the name of the gene/protein of interest or click on the
suggested links in the web page (http://macpak.csml.org). Then,
a list of pathways that contains the gene/protein of interest is
shown (Fig. 1a). After selecting the pathway to be analyzed, the
web page (Fig. lb) containing the information about the process
is shown, which has links to external databases like Entrez Gene,
InterPro and PubMed and an executable ﬁle that can be simulated
under Cytoscape, Cell Illustrator Online and Cell Illustrator Player
platforms. Figure 1c shows an example of model that was obtained
by analyzing the MyD88 pathway using Cell Illustrator Player.
Figure 1d is the output of Cytoscape and Figure leis the simulation
result using Cell Illustrator Online.

(Lynn et al., 2008) and (Raza et al., 2010), and to the best of
our knowledge, MACPAK is the ﬁrst macrophage-speciﬁc database
which integrates manually curated network (pathway) information
to experimental quantitative results and also allows researchers
to simulate and study the pathways in a dynamic and interactive
manner. If observed time-course biological data are available
(microarray data, for instance), it can be used to ﬁnd the best set
of parameters that ﬁt to the model by using Data Assimilation
techniques (Koh et al., 2010). Therefore, by combining the pathway
models and actual biological data, biomedical researchers can obtain
hints of what is happening and what will happen when the biological
system is perturbed, for example, by inhibiting one pathway using
a drug.

A local installation of MACPAK is not necessary because all
the applications including Cell Illustrator Online, Cell Illustrator
Player and a customized Cytoscape run under the Java Web Start
technology. The customized Cytoscape has a CSML plugin enabling
Cytoscape to import CSML models developed by our members. All
the pathways are stored in an XML format, shown in an HTML
ﬁle in the web browser, while the simulations run via Internet
using Cell Illustrator Online. Once a CSML ﬁle is imported to
the customized Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011), our model can be
exported to various formats, e.g. XGMML, Vizmap, SIF and GML
(Graph Modeling Language), which allow ﬁirther visualization and
analysis by other platforms such as eXpanda (Negishi et al., 2007)
and MAVisto (Schreiber and Schwobbermeyer, 2005). Moreover,
ontology information (Cell System Ontology) of each entity and/or
process is also provided. Thus, the curated pathway can also be
validated using the ontology-based approach proposed by (Jeong
et al., 2011).

In order to expand the usability of MACPAK, several
ﬁinctionalities are continuously being developed, such as the
software to convert CSML 3.0 to the well-known SBML level
2 version 4 (Systems Biology Markup Language) (Hucka et al.,
2003). With the customized Cytoscape available at the web page,
it is possible to save the CSML model in any format supported
by Cytoscape and continue the downstream analysis in other
platforms that accept Cytoscape output ﬁles. In parallel, a more
interactive interface based on emerging web standards and a
graphical representation following the Systems Biology Graphical
Notation (SBGN) are also being developed (Le Novere et al., 2009).

ABSTRACT

Summary: Sequencing pooled DNA samples (Pool-Seq) is the
most cost-effective approach for the genome-wide comparison of
population samples. Here, we introduce PoPoolation2, the first
software tool specifically designed for the comparison of populations
with Pool-Seq data. PoPoolation2 implements a range of commonly
used measures of differentiation (FST, Fisher’s exact test and
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test) that can be applied on different
scales (windows, genes, exons, SNPs). The result may be visualized
with the widely used Integrated Genomics Viewer.

Availability and Implementation: PoPoolation2 is implemented
in Perl and R. It is freely available on http://code.google.com/p/

1 INTRODUCTION

Next-generation sequencing of pooled DNA samples (Pool-Seq)
allows the comparison of population samples on a genomic
scale, thus facilitating the transition from single marker studies
to population genomics. Due to its cost-effectiveness (Futschik
and Schlotterer, 2010), Pool-Seq can be used for a range of
applications. The most intuitive application is the comparison of
natural populations to perform standard population genetic analyses
on a genomic scale (e.g. Begun et al., 2007). The comparison
of natural Arabidopsis lyrata populations from different habitats
allowed the Characterization of genes involved in heavy metal
tolerance (Turner et al., 2010). Also in experimental evolution
studies, Pool-Seq has been used to identify genomic regions that
show high differentiation between different selective treatments
(Burke et al., 2010; Parts et al., 2011; Turner et al., 2011). Finally,
Pool-Seq offers an enormous potential for selective genotyping
(Darvasi and Soller, 1994; Hillel et al., 1990; Lander and Botstein,
1989).

While several tools for analyzing Pool-Seq data of single
populations are already available (Bansal, 2010; Koﬂer et al., 2011;
Pandey et al., 2011), to our knowledge no standalone software

tool is available for the comparison of Pool-Seq data for multiple
populations. PoPoolation2 is a software tool dedicated to the
comparison of allele frequencies between populations.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

As input PoPoolation2 requires a ‘pileup’ ﬁle for every population
(sample) of interest or alternatively a single multi ‘pileup’
ﬁle (mpileup) may be used. These ﬁles can be obtained by
mapping the reads of a Pool-Seq experiment to a reference
genome and subsequently converting the mapping results into the
‘pileup/mpileup’ format with samtools (Li et al., 2009) (For Manual
see http://Code.google.Com/p/popoolation2/wiki/Manual; Test data
and tutorial http://Code.google.com/p/popoolation2/wiki/Tutorial).
PoPoolation2 requires Pool-Seq data from at least two populations,
but may be used with an unlimited number of populations.

To assess allele frequency differences between population
samples PoPoolation2 implements a wide variety of statistics.

0 As the most intuitive measure of population differentiation, the
allele frequency differences are reported.

0 The ﬁxation index (FST) can be calculated to measure
differentiation between populations. F ST values may either be
calculated with the Classical approach (Hartl and Clark, 2007)
or with an approach adapted to digital data (Karlsson et al.,
2007)

0 The statistical signiﬁcance of allele frequency differences is
determined with Fisher’s exact test (Fisher, 1922).

0 Since in experimental evolution experiments and selective
genotyping studies often biological replicates are available,
we implemented the Cochran—Mantel—Haenszel (CMH) test
(Landis et al., 1978) to test for the statistical signiﬁcance
between groups.

When data from more than two populations are available,
PoPoolation2 automatically computes all pairwise comparisons for
these tests (except for the CMH test).

All these analyses can be performed on different levels. We have
implemented a sliding window analysis, which permits a genome-
wide scan for differentiation using a speciﬁed window size. For
the analysis of single SNPs, a window size of 1 may be used.
Finally, with a user-provided GTF ﬁle the analysis of genes, coding
sequence, introns, etc. is possible. To visualize the population
differentiation across the genome, PoPoolation2 converts the results
into ﬁle formats that are compatible with the Integrative Genomics
Viewer (Robinson et al., 2011).

Finally, PoPoolation2 also implements the functionality to
randomly subsample the data to achieve a uniform coverage.
The subsampling is based on a user-deﬁned quality threshold.
For analyzing the data with standard software, such as Mega5
(Tamura et al., 2011) and Arlequin (Excofﬁer and Lischer, 2010),
PoPoolation2 allows exporting the data as artiﬁcial Chromosomes
as ‘multi-fasta’ ﬁles and as ‘GenePop’ ﬁles (Raymond and Rousset,
1995).

3 VALIDATION

To test PoPoolation2, we placed 10000 SNPs for two populations
on Chromosome 2R of Drosophila melanogaster (v5.38). For these
SNPs, we simulated 75 bp reads such that the coverage was 100><
and the allele frequency differences between the two populations
ranged from 0.1 to 0.9. Subsequently, the simulated reads were
mapped to the reference genome (D. melanogaster, Chromosome 2R,
V5.38) with BWA (0.5.8) (Li and Durbin, 2009) and a ‘mpileup’ ﬁle
was created using samtools (0.1.13) (Li et al., 2009). Finally, we
compared the expected values with the observed ones and found
an almost perfect correlation between the simulated data and the
estimates based on PoPoolation2 for all implemented tests (allele
frequency differences: R2 = 0.9979, P < 2.2e- 16; FST :R2 = 0.9967,
P<2.2e-l6; Fisher’s exact test: R2=0.9974, P<2.2e-l6; CMH
test: R2 =0.9978, P <2.2e-l6; Fig. 1). These high correlations
conﬁrm that PoPoolation2 yields highly reliable results (for details,
see http://Code.google.Com/p/popoolation2/wiki/Validation).

To ensure that all scripts continue to work properly, we
implemented Unit-tests for the main scripts (which may be run by
providing the parameter ‘—test’).

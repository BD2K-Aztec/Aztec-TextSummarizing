input sequence is predicted as a non-mitochondrial protein (TPpred
shows the lowest false-positive rate among the state-of-the-art methods;
Indio et al., 2013). If TPpred identiﬁes a targeting peptide, the cleavage
site prediction is reﬁned using an additional SVM classiﬁer (second step).
In the reﬁnement step, the classiﬁer operates analyzing an optimal
29-residue-long segment centered on the TPpred-predicted cleavage site.
The reﬁnement SVM is fed using three input features: (i) two GRHCRF-
derived positional posterior probabilities that score the likelihood for the
cleavage site to be located at a given sequence position and (ii) a feature
deﬁned on the basis of the occurrence of the sequence motifs described in
the previous section. The reﬁned cleavage site is the position scoring with
the highest SVM output probabilities. When the SVM probability is <0.5
for any position in the segment, the cleavage site predicted by TPpred is
retained (for details, see Supplementary Section 1.2).

2.3 Usage and program requirements

TPpred2 is available both as web server and command-line tool. The
TPpred2 web server (http://tppred2.biocomp.unibo.it) requires a single
protein sequence in FASTA format. Once the input sequence is pro-
cessed, the output page contains all the information about the identiﬁed
targeting peptide (when detected), including the cleavage site location and
a reliability score attached to the prediction. The command-line version
of the program is well suited for large-scale genomic analyses (whereas
the web server can handle a single protein sequence at a time). The pro-
gram source code and example data are available at http://tppred2.bio
comp.unibo.it. After unpacking, the TPpred2 command-line program is
ready to use (see Supplementary Section 2.2 for further instructions about
the initial conﬁguration), and the user can operate by simply providing a
multi-FASTA ﬁle as input to the program. For each protein sequence
contained in the input ﬁle, TPpred2 lists the putative location of the
cleavage site (when detected, the symbol ‘-’ otherwise) and the corres-
ponding reliability score (for both positive and negative predictions).

2.4 TPPRED2 performance

The overall performance of TPpred2 in discriminating mitochondrial
from non-mitochondrial proteins is similar to that of TPpred (Indio
et al., 2013). However, TPpred2 is superior to TPpred in detecting the
mitochondrial cleavage site. In Table 1, we compare the performance
of both TPpred2 and the legacy TPpred obtained using a 5-fold cross-
validation procedure. Two different scoring measures are computed:
(i) the fraction of proteins whose cleavage sites have been perfectly iden-
tiﬁed (Cleave* columns) and (ii) the mean absolute error on cleavage site
identiﬁcation (ME* columns) that measures the average distance between
predicted and observed cleavage sites. Scoring indexes are computed over
the entire dataset of 202 proteins (Cleavean, MEHH) and over the subset of
139 proteins whose cleavage site matches at least one sequence motif
(Cleavemouf, MEmouf). Evidently, the new TPpred2 predictor signiﬁcantly
outperforms the legacy TPpred in the task of identifying the cleavage site.
The improvement is particularly evident when the predictors are com-
pared on the subset of proteins whose cleavage sites match with the se-
quence motifs. Furthermore, even when the site is not correctly located,
TPpred2 provides better predictions, as highlighted by the reduced abso-
lute error in cleavage identiﬁcation.

3 CONCLUSION

In this article, we present TPpred2, a software tool for the pre—
diction of mitochondrial targeting peptides and their cleavage
sites. The improved performance of TPpred2 is achieved by
jointly exploiting, for the first time to our knowledge, peculiar
sequence motifs characterizing the cleavage site and GRHCRF
prediction signals. The new TPpred2 predictor is able to better
identify cleavage sites when compared with our previous imple—
mentation. The software is available as a web server and, most
importantly, as a stand—alone program, making it well suited for
large—scale genomic analysis.

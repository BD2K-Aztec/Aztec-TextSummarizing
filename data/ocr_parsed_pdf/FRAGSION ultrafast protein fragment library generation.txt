Abstract

Motivation: Speed, accuracy and robustness of building protein fragment library have important
implications in de novo protein structure prediction since fragment—based methods are one of
the most successful approaches in template—free modeling (FM). Majority of the existing fragment
detection methods rely on database—driven search strategies to identify candidate fragments,
which are inherently time—consuming and often hinder the possibility to locate longer fragments
due to the limited sizes of databases. Also, it is difficult to alleviate the effect of noisy sequence—
based predicted features such as secondary structures on the quality of fragment.

Results: Here, we present FRAGSION, a database—free method to efficiently generate protein fragment
library by sampling from an Input—Output Hidden Markov Model. FRAGSION offers some unique fea—
tures compared to existing approaches in that it (i) is lightning—fast, consuming only few seconds of
CPU time to generate fragment library for a protein of typical length (300 residues); (ii) can generate
dynamic—size fragments of any length (even for the whole protein sequence) and (iii) offers ways to
handle noise in predicted secondary structure during fragment sampling. On a FM dataset from the
most recent Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction, we demonstrate that FGRAGSION provides
advantages over the state—of—the—art fragment picking protocol of ROSE'I'I'A suite by speeding up com—
putation by several orders of magnitude while achieving comparable performance in fragment quality.
Availability and implementation: Source code and executable versions of FRAGSION for Linux
and MacOS is freely available to non—commercial users at http://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/

1 Introduction

Fragment library is one of the key components of Widely used frag—
ment—based protein structure prediction methods (Kolodny and
Levitt, 2003; Simons et (11., 1997), Where complete models of the tar—
get structures are generated by combining fragments from the library.
Therefore, improving speed, accuracy and robustness of fragment li—
brary generation have direct impact on the performance of these
methods. Several approaches have been introduced over the last

decade for fragment detection ranging from exhaustive search to
more sophisticated profile hidden Markov models (HMM) based
comparison (Kalev and Habeck, 2011). These methods require a tem—
plate database against Which segment of the target sequence is
matched in order to identify suitable fragments. Due to large size of
the template database that includes all representative structures from
the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et (11., 2000), the search is often

slow. Moreover, the incomplete coverage of PDB makes it difficult to
map a reasonably large fragment for the target protein. Recent devel—
opments in fragment selection using probabilistic models (Boomsma
et (11., 2008; Hamelryck et (11., 2006) have shown promising directions
to overcome the size and diversity restriction of database—driven
approaches by sampling local structure from a generative model.
Here, we extend their scope by (i) sampling fragments of protein
backbone in full—atomic detail rather than using a coarse—grained rep—
resentation or assuming ideality in backbone planarity and (ii) allow—
ing robustness against noise in sequence—based predicted information
like secondary structure. The resulting application, FRAGSION, has
been compared to the popular database—driven fragment assignment
protocol of ROSETTA (Gront et (11., 201 1) on template—free modeling
(FM) targets from 11th edition of Critical Assessment of Structure
Prediction (CASP11) experiment. The results show that FRAGSION
(i) provides slightly better coverage than ROSETTA at the expense of
minor loss in precision and (ii) computationally much more efficient
than ROSETTA.

2 Methods

FRAGSION is implemented on top of our recently—developed Input—
Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM) (Bhattacharya and Cheng,
2015) tested in the CASP11. In each slice of the IOHMM, a discrete
input node A represents eight groups of residues showing distinct
structural behavior (Gly, Pro, Ile/Val, other general residues and each
of these groups preceding Pro) selected from twenty standard residue
types, while the discrete emission node S denotes the three—state sec—
ondary structure types (Helix, Strand and Coil). We model backbone
torsion angles pairs ()9 and \ll using mixtures of bivariate von Mises dis—
tributions (Mardia et (11., 2007) and (o dihedral angle of the peptide
bonds using mixtures of univariate von Mises distributions (Mardia
and Jupp, 2009). A description of the model, training and model selec—
tion is provided in the Supplementary Information. The output emis—
sion nodes can be ﬂagged as observed or hidden for a specific
sequence position. This enables us to deal with noise in the sequence—
derived predicted secondary structure by ﬂagging secondary structure
as observed only in residue positions for confident prediction and leav—
ing the rest as hidden. Furthermore, using a probabilistic model makes
it possible to sample potentially unlimited sequence of angles access—
ible to proteins for any given stretch of sequence.

3 Results

We assessed the performance of FRAGSION using 30 CASP11FM
domains (Supplementary Information) by simulating in a blind de
novo protein structure prediction scenario. First, we obtained se—
quences of the target proteins from CASP11 and executed PSIPRED
(Jones, 1999) to predict secondary structure using a non—redundant
(NR) protein sequence database curated before CASP11. The sequence
and predicted secondary structures were then used to generate 200
fragments for each sequence position with variable fragment lengths
ranging from 3—mer to 20—mer. The experimental structures of target
domains were then downloaded from CASP11 and the residues that
were not present in experimental structures were discarded from frag—
ment libraries. Finally, we assessed the quality of fragment library by
superimposing each fragment in the library on to the experimental
structure. We used two commonly used metrics to measure accuracy
of fragment library: (i) precision (the proportion of good fragments in
the libraries): number of good fragments divided by total number of
fragments in a library and (ii) coverage (the proportion of protein

residues represented by a good fragment): number of residues repre—
sented by at least one good fragment divided by number of residues of
the target. We also executed ROSETTA’s fragment picker application
(Version 3.5) with the same input to generate fragment libraries using
a template database created before CASP11 and after excluding
all homologues fragments during ROSETTA’s fragment picking.
The results show that there is only some minor difference between the
performance of FRAGSION and ROSETTA over the entire dataset at
various RMSD cutoffs between 0.1 and 4.0  (Fig. 1). FRAGSION
provides slight advantage in coverage (64 versus 63%) while
ROSETTA is slightly better in terms of precision (26 versus 24%).
Average RMSD of fragments for different fragment lengths are also
comparable (3.8  for FRAGSION and 3.7  for ROSETTA).

To investigate the effect of fragment quality on the performance
of de novo protein modeling, we executed AbinitioRelax application
of ROSETTA (Simons et (11., 1997) to generate two model pools
(each pool has 100 models) for each target using 9mer and 3mer
fragments from FRAGSION and ROSETTA. The average accuracy
of models generated using ROSETTA’s fragments is better than
FRAGSION’s in terms of RMSD (19.980 A for FRAGSION and
17.995  for ROSETTA). The most accurate models in terms of
TM—score (Zhang and Skolnick, 2004) using ROSETTA’s fragments
outperforms that of FRAGSION’s for all targets. Accuracy of
FRAGSION’s best prediction in terms of RMSD, however, is better
than ROSETTA’s for six targets. The models having the lowest
ROSETTA energy generated using FRAGSION’s fragment library
outperforms that of ROSETTA’s for ten targets in terms of RMSD
and only for three targets in terms of TM—score. In general, the ac—
curacy of models generated using ROSETTA’s fragments is better
than FRAGSION’s. The most significant advantage of FRAGSION
is, therefore, speed. Average computation time for FRAGSION
takes only 24 s, more than 75 times faster than ROSETTA with
average computation time exceeding 30 min. A target—by—target
comparison between FRAGSION and ROSETTA is presented in the
supplementary document along with analysis on the qualities of the
model pools produced using fragments generated by FRAGSION
and ROSETTA.

4 Conclusion

We developed an easy—to—use software tool (FRAGSION) based on an
input—output hidden Markov model (IOHMM) to sample structural
fragments for proteins. The model—based tool without carrying a large
fragment database is light—weighted and very fast and has the perform—
ance comparable to some widely used fragment generation tool, which
makes it a useful tool for template—free protein structure modeling.

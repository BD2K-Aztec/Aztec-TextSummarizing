Abstract

Summary: Participating as the Cornell—Gdansk group, we have used our physics—based coarse—
grained UNited RESidue (UNRES) force field to predict protein structure in the 11th Community
Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction
(CASP11). Our methodology involved extensive multiplexed replica exchange simulations of the
target proteins with a recently improved UNRES force field to provide better reproductions of the
local structures of polypeptide chains. All simulations were started from fully extended polypeptide
chains, and no external information was included in the simulation process except for weak re—
straints on secondary structure to enable us to finish each prediction within the allowed 3—week
time window. Because of simplified UNRES representation of polypeptide chains, use of enhanced
sampling methods, code optimization and parallelization and sufficient computational resources,
we were able to treat, for the first time, all 55 human prediction targets with sizes from 44 to 595
amino acid residues, the average size being 251 residues. Complete structures of six single—
domain proteins were predicted accurately, with the highest accuracy being attained for the T0769,
for which the CocRMSD was 3.8 A for 97 residues of the experimental structure. Correct structures
were also predicted for 13 domains of multi—domain proteins with accuracy comparable to that of
the best template—based modeling methods. With further improvements of the UNRES force field
that are now underway, our physics—based coarse—grained approach to protein—structure prediction
will eventually reach global prediction capacity and, consequently, reliability in simulating protein
structure and dynamics that are important in biochemical processes.

1 Introduction

Template—based and other knowledge—based methods are currently
used routinely for the modeling of unknown protein structures.
However, despite tremendous advancement in the field (Dill and
MacCallum, 2012) the quality of the resulting structures depends
strongly on the similarity of the target protein sequences to those in
the Protein Data Bank (PDB). If even a small section of the sequence
has weak similarity to those of PDB proteins, the uncertainty of the
prediction increases dramatically. Therefore, advantage is taken of
our coarse—grained procedure, UNited RESidue (UNRES), which
performs successfully with comparable accuracy as that of hom—
ology modeling. The latter performs better than UNRES only when
there is a good template in the PDB. However, when no such tem—
plates exist, homology modeling is not superior to UNRES. For that
reason, for the proteins for which there are no good templates in the
databases, the de novo methods, not using knowledge—based infor—
mation, are superior to the template—based modeling (TBM)
methods.

In the physics—based approaches, the prediction candidates are
selected from the basin(s) with the lowest free energy and, conse—
quently, such methods involve large—scale molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations which enable us to perform extensive walks in
the conformational space [e.g. replica—exchange Monte Carlo
(Hansmann and Okamoto, 1993; Hansmann, 1997; Kolinski and
Skolnick, 2004; Latek and Kolinski, 2008), replica—exchange mo—
lecular dynamics (REMD) (Mitsutake et (11., 2003; Pande et (11.,
2003; Czaplewski et (11., 2009) or the multiplexed REMD
(MREMD) application (Rhee and Pande, 2003)]. Such simulations
are very expensive to perform with all—atom representations even
for small proteins and even with the use of the most powerful
supercomputers available because of too large discrepancy between
the MD time step (1—10 fs) and the time—scale of protein folding
(microseconds for the fastest folders to seconds; Kubelka et (11.,
2004).

Use of dedicated supercomputers such as ANTON (Shaw et (11.,
2008) helps to overcome some of the limitations, but the access to
such machines is restricted, and the size or the effective time—scale of
the simulation is limited to 200 amino acid residues and microsec—
onds, respectively (Sanbonmatsu et (11., 2005; Lindorff—Larsen et (11.,
2011, 2012). Owing to the elimination of the fast—moving degrees of
freedom (Khalili et (11., 2005; Liwo et (11., 2005), using the coarse—
grained approaches, enables us to extend both the time—scale (by
about 3—4 orders of magnitude) and the size—scale of simulations.
Thus, the main advantage of coarse—grained models, with properly
designed knowledge—based potentials such as CABS (Jamroz et (11.,
2013; Kurcinski et (11., 2015) and Primo (Kar et (11., 2013) or
physics—based potentials such as Martini (Monticelli et (11., 2008;
Goga et (11., 2015) and UNRES (Liwo et (11., 2014; Mozolewska
et (11., 2015) that can locate native—like structures (not necessarily
with perfect experimental—quality resolution) in free Monte Carlo or
MD simulations, is the ability to simulate the dynamics of the rela—
tively large systems in reasonable time—scale (Ingélfsson et (11.,
2014). However, the development of coarse—grained force fields is
much more difficult than that of all—atom force fields because the ef—
fective energy function originates from the potential of mean force
of the system, in which the insignificant degrees of freedom have
been integrated out, and additional terms, like multibody potentials,
are necessary to compensate for the missing effects (Liwo et (11.,
2001; Ayton et (11., 2007)

In our laboratory, we have been developing the UNRES
force field (Liwo et (11., 1993, 1997, 2014) which uses a

coarse—grained representation of polypeptide chains. Our physics—
based approach to protein—structure prediction, that uses the
UNRES force field, performed reasonably well in biannual CASP
Community Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of
Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction, exercises to obtain
fold topology, e.g. for targets T0061, T0063 and T0079 in CASP3
(Lee et (11., 1999, 2000), T0102 in CASP4 (Liwo et (11., 2011),
T0129 and T0149 in CASP5, T0215, T0223, T0230 and T0281 in
CASP6 (Oldziej et (11., 2005), T0534, T0537 and T0578 in CASP9
(Liwo et (11., 2011) and T0644, T0663, T0668 and T0740 in
CASP10 (He et (11., 2013; Khoury et (11., 2014). However, because
the UNRES predictions are generally of medium—resolution quality,
which is remarkably lower than those for TBM targets, UNRES
was featured only for new—fold targets (proteins with unique orien—
tation of the local structure) and for targets with new types of do—
main packing.

In the CASP10 experiment, two UNRES—based predictions made
only by the Cornell—Gdansk group, and by one other group with
additional participants, were featured by the assessors (He et (11.,
2013). The first one was a two—domain target T0663 (treated by the
Cornell—Gdansk group) (He et (11., 2013), and the second one was
T0740 (treated by the waPUNK group within the WeFold initia—
tive) (Khoury et (11., 2014); in the second prediction exercise,
UNRES was supplemented with contact—prediction restraints. In the
CASP10 experiment, we proved that the UNRES force field is a very
good tool to predict the orientation of the domains for the 2—fold
symmetry target T066 3 (He et (11., 2013) that was further confirmed
by post—CASP tests with use of restraints within the domains, but
not between them (Krupa et (11., 2015).

In the past CASP experiments, we were not able to predict all of
the human—prediction targets within the 3—week time—window from
the target announcement to the submission deadline, because of
limited manpower and computer resources. CASP11 was the first
exercise in which the Cornell—Gdansk group was able to perform
simulations for every human—prediction target using our physics—
based approach, treating all 55 human—prediction targets, varying
in size from 44 (for target T0797) to 595 amino acid residues (for
target T0793), with the average size being 251 residues. These tar—
gets represented all structural classes. We used the newest version
of the UNRES force field supplemented with energy terms corres—
ponding to the coupling between backbone—local and sidechain—
local conformational states (Krupa et (11., 2013; Sieradzan et (11.,
2015).

2 Materials and methods

2.1 UNRES representation of polypeptide chain
We used the UNRES (Liwo et (11., 1993, 2001, 2004, 2007, 2008,
2011, 2014) coarse—grained physics—based force field to perform cal—
culations, which provides a 4 order—of—magnitude speed—up com—
pared with all—atom calculations. In the UNRES model, a
polypeptide chain is represented by a sequence of C“ atoms with
united peptide groups (p), each of which is placed between two con—
secutive Cas, and united side chains (SC) (represented by ellipsoids
of revolution), which are attached to the C“ atoms. Only the SC and
p centers are interaction sites; the Ca—carbon atoms serve only to de—
fine the geometry of a chain (Fig. 1).

The UNRES force field originates from the potential of mean
force of a protein in an aqueous environment, which has been ex—
panded into a cluster—cumulant series to provide an implementable

and which reﬂect the dependence of the first generalized—cumulant
term in those factors on temperature, as discussed in Liwo et al.

geometry and are not the interaction centers. The equilibrium length of a

The term Uscisci represents the mean free energy of the hydro—
phobic (hydrophilic) interactions between the SCs, which implicitly
contain the contributions from the interactions of the SC with the
solvent. The term USCipi denotes the excluded—volume potential of
the side—chain—peptide—group interactions. The peptide—group inter—
action potential is split into two parts: the Lennard—Jones interaction
energy between peptide—group centers (Uggw) and the average elec—
trostatic energy between peptide—group dipoles (Ugly); the second of
these terms accounts for the tendency to form backbone hydrogen
bonds between peptide groups p,- and 17,-. The terms Um, Umrd, Uh,
Um, and Ubond are the virtual—bond—dihedral angle torsional terms,
virtual—bond dihedral angle double—torsional terms, virtual—bond
angle bending terms, side—chain rotamer and virtual—bond—
deformation terms; these terms account for the local properties of
the polypeptide chain. The terms U31), represent correlation or mul—
tibody contributions from the coupling between backbone—local and
backbone—electrostatic interactions, and the terms U332, are correl—
ation contributions involving m consecutive peptide groups; they
are, therefore, termed turn contributions. The multibody terms are
indispensable for reproduction of regular ot—helical and ﬁ—sheet struc—
tures (Kolinski and Skolnick, 1992; Liwo et (11., 1998, 2001). Ussbond
is the disulfide bond formation potential calculated over all possible
permutations of disulfide bonds (7155). The Usc_m,, terms are new
knowledge— and physics—based side—chain backbone correlation po—
tentials (Krupa et (11., 2013; Sieradzan et (11., 2015) recently intro—
duced to the UNRES force field, which improved the correctness of
secondary—structure and loop modeling with the UNRES force field.

2.2 Structure prediction procedure

For ab initio protein structure prediction with UNRES, we de—
veloped a detailed procedure which is summarized in Figure 2,
which was strictly adhered to by all predictors of the Cornell—
Gdansk group during CASP11 and involves no subjective selection
of any prediction candidate. Owing to semi—automatic generation of
input files, all the simulations were run in repeatable and unified
way in constant conditions for all human targets. Contrary to the
TBM methods, as a result the UNRES prediction procedure provides

dynamics and thermodynamics of the investigated proteins, which is
not possible from homology modeling.

For each target, the first step of the procedure is to predict its sec—
ondary structure by using PSIPRED (Jones, 1999; McGuffin et (11.,
2000; Buchan et (11., 2013) to determine whether the protein con—
tains only ot—helical structure or both 0(— and/or ﬁ—structure. If the tar—
get is recognized to contain only ot—helical structure, the force field
originally parametrized with the 1GAB (ct—helical) protein (Liwo
et (11., 2007) is used; otherwise, the force field parametrized with
two mini—proteins: the tryptophan cage (or—helical, PDB code 1L2Y)
and the tryptophan zipper (Ii—sheet, PDB code 1LE1) (He et (11.,
2009) is used. No restraints are imposed, for ot—helical structures
whereas, for the l)’ and or + [3 targets, weak restraints are imposed on
the virtual—bond—dihedral angle v (Fig. 1), based on the results of
secondary—structure predictions, to speed—up the calculations. The
restraints have the form of a ﬂat—bottom quartic function:

where k : 0.01 kcal/(mol >< rad4), L: 30°, “N: 70° for the 0(— and
y_: 140°, in: 220° for the ﬁ—structure, which are typical ranges of
the torsional angle v observed for these types of structures.

As follows from Figure 2, in CASP11 we used two versions of
the UNRES force field, one referred to as the ‘1GAB’ force field, par—
ameterized with the 1GAB ot—helical protein and is good for simulat—
ing proteins with ot—helical structure (Liwo et (11., 2007) and another
one, referred to as ‘1LE1 86 1L2Y’, parameterized with the
tryptophan—cage and tryptophan—zipper mini proteins, which is a
general—purpose force field but gives lower resolution of the pro—
duced models (He et (11., 2009). As can be seen from Figure 2, the se—
lection of the appropriate force field depended on the results of
secondary—structure prediction with PSIPRED.

In the second step of the procedure, MREMD simulations (Rhee
and Pande, 2003; Liwo et (11., 2008) with UNRES are carried out,
using our implementation of MREMD to this force field
(Czaplewski et (11., 2009). Each of the MREMD simulations is run
at 32 temperatures (250, 255, 260, 265, 270, 275, 280, 285, 290,
295, 300, 305, 310, 315, 320, 325, 330, 335, 340, 345, 350, 360,
380, 390, 400, 410, 420, 430, 440, 460, 480, and 500 K) with two
trajectories per temperature, providing a total of 64 trajectories.
Typically, 20 000 000 MD steps at time intervals of 4.89 fs are run
for each trajectory, which provides about 0.1 Ms formal time and 1
ms real time per trajectory, given the time—scale extension of
UNRES (Khalili et (11., 2005; Liwo et (11., 2005). Replicas are
exchanged every 20 000 MD time steps. Running MREMD in a
wide range of temperatures enables us to explore the conformational
space more exhaustively than in canonical MD simulations.
Moreover, MREMD simulation runs are efficiently parallelizable, in
the UNRES force field energy and force calculations, reaching up to
75% efficiency with over 4000 CPUs (Liwo et (11., 2008; Liwo and
Oldziej, 2010). Also, as mentioned above, weak secondary—structure
restraints were added to the energy function; their inclusion speeded
up the simulations by a factor of about 2, which enabled us to cut
the length of each trajectory to fulfill the time window of predic—
tions. Because the secondary—structure—prediction methods included
in PSIPRED are accurate, the chance of model deterioration because
of wrong secondary—structure restraints is small.

In the third step, the results of MREMD simulations are pro—
cessed with the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM)

(Kumar et (11., 1992), which was implemented in UNRES in our ear—
lier work (Liwo et (11., 2007), to determine the statistical weights of
each of the generated conformations at any desired temperature and
to compute the thermodynamics properties. The last 100 snapshots
from each trajectory (corresponding to the last 2 000 000 MD steps;
12 800 structures in total) are subjected to WHAM and a cluster
analysis. The heat—capacity profile is determined, and the tempera—
ture 10 K below the major heat—capacity peak (corresponding to the
folding transition) is selected for further analysis. Ward’s minimum—
variance clustering (Spath, 1980), using thermodynamic information
obtained by WHAM analysis, is subsequently carried out at this
temperature to partition the whole ensemble into five clusters, which
are the basis for selecting the five candidate models. Thanks to the
temperature dependence of the UNRES force field, calculated
thermodynamic properties are used in the cluster procedure in add—
ition to the distance measurements, and the free energy, instead of
the potential energy, is taken into consideration (Liwo et (11., 2007).

The conformations of the respective clusters are weighted with
the statistical weights calculated by using WHAM, and the clusters
are ranked from the largest (rank 1) to the least probable (rank 5)
based on the sum of the statistical weights (Liwo et (11., 2007). For
each cluster, the mean conformation is determined (by weighting the
coordinates of each conformation with the weights determined by
WHAM) and the conformation of this cluster centroid which has
the lowest C“ RMSD from the average structure is selected as the
candidate coarse—grained model. It should be noted that this feature
of our approach makes it fully physics—based because not only a
physics—based coarse—grained force field is used but also model selec—
tion is based on the thermodynamic hypothesis (Anfinsen, 1973) ac—
cording to which the native structure is an ensemble with the lowest
free energy below the folding—transition temperature and not just
has the lowest—potential energy, which makes a conformation dom—
inant only at 0 K.

In the last step, the five candidate coarse—grained models deter—
mined in the previous step are converted to all—atom structures by
using the PULCHRA (Rotkiewicz and Skolnick, 2008) (conversion
of the C“ trace to all—atom backbone) and SCWRL(Wang et (11.,
2008) (optimization of side—chain conformations), which are more
efficient than the previously used software (Kaimierkiewicz et (11.,
20023,b). These all—atom models are submitted to CASP.

As an example for target T0765 53 000 000 steps of the
MREMD simulation were carried out. The last 12 800 structures
were used in WHAM analysis to determine the statistical weights of
conformations and to compute the thermodynamic properties.
According to the CASP rules, only five structures could be submitted
for evaluation; so the subset of the 1807 structures with the statis—
tical weights corresponding to the temperature of 300 K was clus—
tered into five groups (see Fig. 2), each containing 572, 533, 353,
219 and 130 structures. From each of the clusters, only one repre—
sentative structure (cluster centroid) was chosen and submitted for
evaluation.

The procedure used by us in CASP11 differs by several aspects
from those used in CASP10 (He et (11., 2013) and in previous CASP
experiments (Liwo et (11., 1999; Oldziej et (11., 2005). First, owing to
improved parallelization and code optimization performed lately, as
well as access to larger supercomputer resources, we were able to
treat all CASP1 1 targets released for human prediction instead of se—
lecting only those which were judged not to be TBM targets.
Second, the new Usc_m,, potentials were introduced which improve
the quality of the local structure (Sieradzan et (11., 2015). Third,
model selection was automatized and made fully objective by dis—
secting the population of conformations (weighted by probabilities)

into five clusters and selecting the average structure from each clus—
ter. No ‘inspection by eye’ was involved in model selection.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 General performance of the UNRES force field

As in the last CASP exercises, the CASP11 targets were divided by
the assessors into two major post—CASP categories (Kinch et (11.,
2015) upon the conclusion of the CASP exercise. Category 1 con—
sisted of the TBM targets for which structures of highly homologous
proteins existed in the PDB (Berman, 2000) during the course of the
exercise. Category 2 consisted of the free—modeling (FM) targets, for
which no homologous proteins could be found in the PDB or they
were very difficult to select.

The first group of successful predictions with use of the UNRES
force field consisted of whole structures of targets, which were pre—
dicted with high accuracy with the UNRES force field during
CASP11: T0765_D1 (TBM), T0769_D1 (TBM), T0797 (TBM),
T0803_D1 (TBM), T0816_D1 (TBM) and T0855_D1  All of
those but T0855 turned out to be TBM targets and TBM methods
yielded more accurate models; for T0855, our approach resulted in
models which are among the best models submitted to CASP
(Fig. 9). An example of the well—predicted TBM target is T0769
whose Global Distance Test (GDT) (Zemla et (11., 1999) plots of our
group and the other groups are shown in Figure 3A. For targets
which were not handled by template—based approaches, UNRES pre—
dicted the general fold or part of the fold and its predictions ranked
higher. Example GDT plots for T0771_D1 are shown in Figure 3B.

The second group of the successful predictions with UNRES con—
sists of the targets for which the structures of only individual domains
were predicted with remarkably good accuracy compared with TBM
and other methods; these were T0761 (TBM), T0771_D1 (FM),
T0775_D2 (FM), D3 (FM), and D4 (FM), T0785_D1 (FM),
T0793_D2 (TBM), T0793_D5 (FM), T0799_D2 (TBM) and D3
(TBM), T0820_D1 (FM) and D2 (TBM), and T0834_D2 
Although full convergence of MREMD simulations was not achieved
for multi—domain proteins (T0775, T0793 and T0799) because of the
strictly restricted time window for predictions, our models of their do—
mains are very good. In Figure 4, the GDT—TS (Global Distance Test —
Total Score) values and RMSDs from the experimental structure of the
best models from the Cornell—Gdansk group are compared with the
best predictions over all groups participating in CASP11 and with
those of the Zhang group, which generally performed best in the
CASP11 experiment (Yang et (11., 2015 ) (Fig. 4). As shown, in 11 of 18
cases, the Cornell—Gdansk models are of comparable or better quality
than Zhang models; namely T0761, T0763_D1, T0771_D1,
T0775_D2, T0775_D4, T0785_D1, T0793_D2, T0793_D5,
T0799_D2, T0834_D2, T0855_D1.

Due to the coarse—grained representation of the UNRES force
field and the imperfect rebuilding of the all—atom chain, the GDT
scores are inferior for very small distance cutoffs (up to 1—1.5 A)
compared with the TBM methods. However, in most cases, the
UNRES force field performs very well in higher values of the dis—
tance cutoff (from 5—6 to 10 A), correctly predicting the overall top—
ology of the proteins. The differences between many of the predicted
and the experimental structures are in the loops and other weakly
defined regions, because in the UNRES force field such elements are
highly ﬂexible and submitted models are only the average states of
such elements.

In the next section, some of the UNRES successful predictions
are described brieﬂy and compared with the best performing TBM
group in the CASP 11 experiment.

3.2 Examples of specific successful predictions

T0765 is a 128 amino acid residue target, from which only the struc—
ture of the fragment 33—108 was solved experimentally and used in
the official CASP assessment. These resulting 76 residues form two
or—helices and four antiparallel ﬁ—sheets. Our model 2 of this target
contains all the secondary structure elements and their relative
orientation, and its RMSD from the experimental structure is 5.75
A (Fig. 5). The only differences between model 2 and the experimen—
tal structure occur in the N—terminal part of the protein and in the
first loop, which regions are defined with a lower accuracy in the
crystal structure, presumably because of their ﬂexibility. As can be
seen in Figure 5, the Cornell—Gdansk structure is as comparable
quality to the best Zhang model.

T0769 is a 128 amino acid residue target, from which only the
section 1—97 was subjected to official CASP analysis, due to the
presence of a long, histidine—rich unfolded fragment at the C—ter—
minus of the experimental structure (not shown in Fig. 6).

The experimental structure of the 1—97—residue section contains
two long or—helical fragments and four antiparallel ﬁ—sheets. Our
model 5 of this target is very close to the experimental structure
with RMSD equal to 3.77  and all secondary—structure elements
are correctly oriented in space (Fig. 6 ). The only noticeable differ—
ence is in the placement of the small fourth ﬁ—strand, which is
slightly separated from the other three strands, because of the un—
folded C—terminus. Contrary to the Cornell—Gdansk model, whose
ﬁ—sheets are slightly too straight, the best Zhang model ﬁ—sheets are

slightly too bent; the only other differences in both models are in the
loop fragments.

For T0803 (a 139—residue or + ﬁ—protein), we predicted a general
fold correctly but the details of the structure of the secondary—
structure elements differ from those of the experimental structure, as
shown in Figure 7 in which our model 3 is compared with the ex—
perimental structure. The N—terminal or—helix in our model 3 is bent,
as opposed to the experimental structure in which it is straight, the
core three—stranded antiparallel ﬁ—sheet is packed parallel to the
motif composed of two or—helices and the N— and C—terminal sections
form short or—helices and are not disordered as in the experimental
structure, due to the highly disordered and ﬂexible structure of the
large part of the protein (Fig. 7). The overall C“—RMSD from the ex—
perimental structure is 8.30  The best Zhang model has perfectly
predicted two helices with orientation, which are too bent and sepa—
rated in the Cornell—Gdansk model, but the ﬁ—strands in the Zhang
model are of worse quality.

Target T0816 is a small 68—residue protein formed by four or—
helices. In our model 2, the helices are packed correctly but the se—
cond or—helix is broken, as opposed to the experimental structure and
the best Zhang model (Fig. 8). The overall C“ RMSD of the Cornell—
Gdansk model from the experimental structure is 4.69 

Target T0855 (an FM target) is the last regular human target as—
sessed in the CASP11 experiment. T0855 is a medium size 115—resi—
due protein, the structure of which consists of four short or—helices
and five antiparallel ﬁ—sheets. The C“ RMSD of our model 3 from
the experimental structure is 8.05  but the overall fold of the model
matches the experimental structure (Fig. 9).

The main difference between the experimental structure and the
predicted model 3 are misplaced second and third ﬁ—strands (Fig. 9).
The misplaced ﬁ—strands also caused a slight shift of the third and
fourth or—helices. However, it should be noted that the quality of our
model 3 is comparable to those obtained by approaches that use

knowledge—based input. In particular, the orientation of the particu—
lar fragments inside the protein is mostly correct. The structure of
the FM target T0855 predicted by the Cornell—Gdansk group is an
example, when the de novo method can be superior to the TBM
methods. The Cornell—Gdansk group predicted both the structure of
the secondary elements and their orientation better than the best
TBM group, Zhang, whose best model ﬁ—strand 1 is wrongly pre—
dicted and the orientation of the or—helices is incorrect, resulting in
the improper orientation of the C—terminus.

these approaches continue to emerge. Moreover, the physics—based
methods are the only ones with which to study protein dynamics
and large—scale conformational changes, which are crucial in the
functioning of the machinery of life and, further, to study the mech—
anisms of diseases and to help design effective therapies. In this re—
gard, assessment of the capability of the physics—based methods to
predict protein structures enables us to assess their applicability in
the simulations of biochemical processes.

The Cornell—Gdansk group was the only group in the CASP11
experiment that used only molecular—dynamics simulations without
any knowledge—based information (except for weak secondary—
structure restraints, which were necessary in order to accomplish the
predictions within the strict 3—week time window), and which car—
ried out all human—prediction targets and achieved satisfactory re—
sults. Moreover, the applied prediction procedure was also physics
based because mean structures from the conformational ensembles
with the lowest free energy, rather than the lowest—energy conform—
ations, were selected as candidate predictions. With our physics—
based approach, we achieved good predictions of complete struc—
tures of six medium—sized single—domain proteins and the structures
of 13 complete protein domains and the general fold of the large
multi—domain proteins. The best prediction in terms of RMSD was
achieved for the TBM target T0769 (the C“—RMSD from the experi—
mental structure being 3.8  over the 97 residues). However, the op—
timum character of the UNRES force field can be seen from the
prediction of the small FM target T0855, which is an example of the
situation, in which, due to the lack of good homologous proteins in
the database, the structure prediction with the TBM methods is not
as good as that with the superior UNRES force field. UNRES force
field managed to achieve comparable results to the most of the TBM
methods also for other ‘FM’ targets and domains, such as T0763—
D1, T0771—D1, T0775—D2, T0793—D2, T0820—D1 and T0834-D2.
It is also remarkable that, in CASP1 1, there is only a small difference

between the ranking of our ‘model 1’s’ and our best models indicat—
ing that the UNRES force field, supplemented with the recently
introduced terms corresponding to the coupling of the backbone—
and side—chain—local interactions (Krupa et al., 2013; Sieradzan
et al., 2015 ), enables us to select the most native—like predictions out
of the five models more accurately than the previous version of the
force field used in CASP10.

The better overall performance of our approach in CASP11 com—
pared with previous CASP exercises was achieved because of recent
addition of the new potentials coupling the backbone—local and side—
chain—local conformational states. This improvement enables us to
predict more folds and rank the models better. Nevertheless, the re—
sults show that, even though UNRES predicts a large number of
folds correctly and the accuracy of a few targets is comparable with
the best TBM methods, especially for the TBM targets, the predicted
structures have higher RMSDs from the experimental structures
compared with those predicted by TBM methods.

To improve the capacity of UNRES to predict new folds and to
improve the accuracy of predictions, at present, we are working on
the calibration of the force field, which is aimed at the refinement of
the energy—term weights of the parameters of the expressions for the
energy terms in Equation (1). For this purpose, we have recently de—
veloped a new method for force—field calibration (Zaborowski et al.,
2015), which is based on the maximum—likelihood approach (Seber
and Wild, 1989). A very early variant of the UNRES force field opti—
mized with the use of this approach was already used in CASP11 for
a very limited number of 12 targets. The performance of this variant
of UNRES will be described in a separate paper (A.K. Sieradzan
et al., unpublished data). Full optimization of UNRES is now being
carried out with the maximum—likelihood approach, and the first re—
sults demonstrate that it improves the capability of finding the folds
and to rank the models and the accuracy of the predicted structures
(Zaborowski et al., 2015). Because the simulations could not be run
to achieve full convergence for the largest targets during CASP11,
work is also being carried out in our laboratory to optimize and im—
prove the parallel efficiency of the UNRES code for use with the
optimized force field. It can be anticipated that these improvements
will constitute yet another important step toward accurate predic—
tion of protein structure without the use of any database informa—
tion and, consequently, simulations of important biochemical
processes with a great degree of reliability.

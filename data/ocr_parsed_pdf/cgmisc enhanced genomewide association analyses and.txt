Abstract

Summary: High—throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies facilitate studies of complex
genetic traits and provide new research opportunities. The increasing popularity of genome—wide
association studies (GWAS) leads to the discovery of new associated loci and a better understand—
ing of the genetic architecture underlying not only diseases, but also other monogenic and com—
plex phenotypes. Several softwares are available for performing GWAS analyses, R environment
being one ofthem.

Results: We present cgmisc, an R package that enables enhanced data analysis and visualization of
results from GWAS. The package contains several utilities and modules that complement and
enhance the functionality of the existing software. It also provides several tools for advanced visu—
alization of genomic data and utilizes the power of the R language to aid in preparation of
publication—quality figures. Some of the package functions are specific for the domestic dog
(Canis familiaris) data.

Availability and implementation: The package is operating system—independent and is available
from: https://github.com/cgmisc—team/cgmisc

1 Introduction

 

High-throughput genotyping and sequencing has opened several
new research opportunities to study complex genetic traits and gen-
ome-wide association studies (GWAS) is a popular way to analyse
genotyping data from segregating populations. Widely used GWAS
softwares include PLINK (Purcell et (11., 2007), EMMAX (Kang
et (11., 2010), GCTA (Yang et (11., 2011) and GenABEL (Aulchenko
et (11., 2007). A single software package is rarely sufficiently com-
plete to cover all aspects of a typical genome-wide analysis pipeline.
Transferring data between different softwares is often a laborious

process. One advantage of the GenABEL package, that often makes
it the software of choice, is that in addition to GWAS-specific func-
tionalities, it provides access to the R (R Development Core Team,
2008) language and community-contributed packages. Here we de-
veloped a number of algorithms and solutions to several common
GWAS tasks. Some of these solutions aim at facilitating production
of publication-quality data/results visualization (see, e.g. Fig. 1).
Several cgmisc functions have been used to produce results and visu-
alizations for peer-reviewed publications, e.g. Tengvall et (11., 2013,
Owczarek—Lipska et (11., 2012 and Olsson et (11., 2013. Here, we

Abstract

Summary: Protael is a JavaScript library for creating interactive visualizations of biological
sequences and various associated data. It allows users to generate high—quality vector graphics
(SVG) and integrate it into web pages.

Availability and implementation: Protael distribution, documentation and examples are freely

available at http://protael.org; source code is hosted at https://github.com/sanshu/protaeljs.

1 Introduction

Predictive methods of bioinformatics address the gap between the
explosive growth of sequence data and experimental characteriza—
tion of biomolecules. The number and accuracy of prediction meth—
ods are increasing but the individual algorithms are often
implemented as separate programs and webservers. From a user
point of view this creates a need for ‘shopping around’ and then
often manual integration of the results into a comprehensive bio—
informatics characterization of a protein. At the same time, servers,
which automatically combine results of different prediction algo—
rithms, require graphical tools to integrate different types of protein—
related data and predictions into a single visualization. While there
are many excellent biological sequence visualization tools, most of
them are tightly coupled with the specific data sources and websites
and cannot be easily reused by other resource. At the time of writing
we are aware of several reusable visualization libraries for the web,
including pViz (Mukhyala et (11., 2014), RSCB Protein Feature
Viewer (http://andreasprlic.github.i0/pr0teinfeatureview/), BiOJS/
FeatureViewer (Garcia et (11., 2014) and Mason (Jaschob et (11.,
2015) for feature annotations and SnipViz (Jaschob et (11., 2014) and
JSAV (Martin, 2014) for multiple sequence alignment.

To enable fully customizable visualization of protein sequence fea—
tures, predictions, annotations, various posttranslational modifica—
tions and alignments with known structures (including their local
structural features) we developed Protael—a reusable and extendable
library to display heterogeneous linear protein—related data on the

web. The library is written in JavaScript and uses Cascading Style
Sheets (CSS) to define styles of the graphics elements. The visualiza—
tion content is fully controlled by a single JSON object. Protael is
compatible with all modern browsers on desktop and mobile systems,
and does not require any additional plugin installation. Protael visual—
ization is currently focused on proteins but it can also be used and
customized for nucleic acids. Generated SVG visualization allows un—
restricted scaling and provides vector images. Protael is used to visual—
ize protein data in Cancer3D (Porta—Pardo et (11., 2015), XtalPred
(Jahandideh et (11., 2014), PDBFlex (http://pdbﬂex.0rg/) webservers
and to display alignments of nucleotide sequences in bNAber
(Eroshkin et (11., 2014).

2 Implementation

Protael is a reusable library, which produces interactive and custom—
izable SVG graphics completely on the client machine. Basic usage
requires little knowledge of HTML and JavaScript, and is as simple
as including links to Protael script and dependencies, and writing
couple of lines of code. For more complex applications Protael pro—
vides numerous ways of customization and adding new features.
Protael uses open source libraries for generating visualization
and controls, including SnapSVG (http://snapsvg.i0/), JQuery
(http://jquery.c0m) and JQueryUI (http://jqueryui.c0m). The Protael
starter project is available on the Protael website and is set up in a

way that provides auto—loading of the required versions of libraries
from the content delivery networks.

All input for Protael is included in a JSON object, which con—
tains information about the sequence and annotations to be dis—
played and can be provided via AJAX request to a server or loaded
from a file. Documentation about JSON configuration is available
at http://protael.0rg/d0cs/.

Protael interface contains a control bar that provides functions
such as zoom, export of selected sequence regions, exporting publi—
cation quality vector images, applying different residue—based color—
ing schemes, etc. (see Fig. 1) Flexible data format allows users to
provide arbitrary number of additional object properties, which are
converted to HTML5 data—"' attributes and could be later used for
custom styling and actions.

2.1 Protael visualization

Protael is capable of displaying multiple data types, such as sequence
annotations, substitutions, posttranslational modifications, cleavage
sites, disulfide bridges, various types of quantitative data and align—
ments with known structures. Sequence features, annotations, quan—
titative data and aligned sequences can occupy multiple data tracks.
Users can specify scale for quantitative data and assign tooltips and
external URLs (links) to displayed elements.

2.2 Main sequence

Main sequence area shows the sequence itself and some of its fea—
tures such as predicted transmembrane helices, signal peptides, low
complexity regions, posttranslational modifications and disulfide
bridges. This area has fixed topmost position and cannot be moved
(other visualization tracks could be dragged vertically to form a
more compact chart).

2.3 Sequence features and annotations

The area below the main sequence contains feature and annota—
tion tracks (ftracks), if the appropriate data is provided in the
JSON object. Each track can be styled separately. It is possible to
override styling for individual feature by providing data in JSON
object or via JavaScript call. Depending on the ‘allowOverlap’
parameter value in JSON object, overlapped features will be
drawn either on top of the each other or on different sub—levels to
avoid visual overlapping. Examples of feature tracks include anno—
tated domains (represented as rectangles). Protael also allows dis—
tinct coloring and labeling of sequence regions, showing
posttranslational modifications, cleavage sites and residue substi—
tutions (Fig 1B).

2.4 Quantitative data

The features tracks area is followed by the quantitative data tracks
(qtracks) area. Almost any kind of quantitative data, both discrete
and continuous, could be displayed here. Examples of such data in—
clude probability graphs from predictions of secondary structure
types, predicted structural disorder probability, evolutionary conser—
vation indices, predicted surface accessibility, etc. Quantitative data
can currently be presented as five different chart types: line, area,
spline, spline—area and column chart. Several coloring options are
available including solid color and gradient fills.

2.5 Multiple sequence alignment

The last (bottom) visualization level is used to display sequences
aligned with the main sequence. Developer can choose between two
display options for alignments—either as lines (useful for creating
more compact view of up to 100 sequences) or as strings represent—
ing residue type in one—letter code (practical for up to 30 sequences).

The coloring of aligned sequences, as well as the main sequence, is
also controlled via JSON object. For example one can color aligned
sequences according to the predicted or observed secondary struc—
ture type, or highlight only specific residues (for instance mutation
or binding sites).

Abstract

Motivation: Analysis of organism—specific interactomes has yielded novel insights into cellular
function and coordination, understanding of pathology, and identification of markers and drug tar—
gets. Genes, however, can exhibit varying levels of cell type specificity in their expression, and their
coordinated expression manifests in tissue—specific function and pathology. Tissue—specific/tissue—
selective interaction mechanisms have significant applications in drug discovery, as they are more
likely to reveal drug targets. Furthermore, tissue—specific transcription factors (tsTFs) are signifi—
cantly implicated in human disease, including cancers. Finally, disease genes and protein com—
plexes have the tendency to be differentially expressed in tissues in which defects cause pathology.
These observations motivate the construction of refined tissue—specific interactomes from
organism—specific interactomes.

Results: We present a novel technique for constructing human tissue—specific interactomes. Using
a variety of validation tests (Edge Set Enrichment Analysis, Gene Ontology Enrichment, Disease—
Gene Subnetwork Compactness), we show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms
state—of—the—art techniques. Finally, using case studies of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, we
show that tissue—specific interactomes derived from our study can be used to construct pathways
implicated in pathology and demonstrate the use of these pathways in identifying novel targets.

1 Introduction

Proteins are basic workhorses of living cells. Their overall quantity
is tightly regulated across different tissues and cell types to manifest
tissue—specific biology and pathobiology. These regulatory controls
orchestrate cellular machinery at different levels of resolution,
including, but not limited to, gene regulation (Goring, 2012; Mele
et (11., 2015), epigenetic modification (Chatterjee and Vinson, 2012;
Mendizabal et (11., 2014), alternative splicing (Buljan et (11., 2012;
Ellis et (11., 2012) and post—translational modifications (Ikegami
et (11., 2014; Vaidyanathan and Wells, 2014). Transcriptional regu—
lation is a key component of this hierarchical regulation, which has
been widely used to study context—specific phenotypes. In the con—
text of human tissues/cell types, genes can exhibit varying levels of
specificity in their expression. They can be broadly classified as: (i)
tissue—specific (unique to one cell type); (ii) tissue—selective (shared
among coherent groups of cell types); and (iii) housekeeping (HK;

utilized in all cell types). Tissue—specific/tissue—selective genes have
significant applications in drug discovery, since they have been
shown to be more likely drug targets (Dezso et (11., 2008). Tissue—
specific transcription factors (tsTFs) are significantly implicated in
human diseases (Messina et (11., 2004; Raj et (11., 2014), including
cancers (Vaquerizas et (11., 2009). Finally, disease genes and protein
complexes tend to be over—expressed in tissues in which defects
cause pathology (Lage et (11., 2008).

The majority of human proteins does not work in isolation but
take part in pathways, complexes and other functional modules.
Tissue—speciﬁc proteins are known to follow a similar trend.
Perturbations that impact interacting interfaces of proteins are signifi—
cantly enriched among tissue—specific, disease—causing variants
(Rolland et (11., 2014; Sahni et (11., 2015; Wang et (11., 2012). This em—
phasizes the importance of constructing tissue—specific interactomes
and their constitutive pathways for understanding mechanisms that

differentiate cell types and make them uniquely susceptible to tissue—
specific disorders. Prior attempts at reconstructing human
tissue—specific interactomes rely on a set of ‘expressed genes’ in each
tissue, and use this set as the baseline of transcriptional activity. The
node removal (NR) method (Bossi and Lehner, 2009) constructs
tissue—specific interactomes by identifying the induced subgraph of the
expressed genes. Magger et al. (2012) propose a method called ‘Edge
ReWeig/oting (ERW)’, which extends the NR method to weighted
graphs. This method penalizes an edge once, if one of its endpoints is
not expressed, and twice, if both endpoints are missing from the ex—
pressed gene set.

While these methods have been used to study tissue—specific
interactions, their underlying construction relies only on the imme—
diate endpoints of each interaction to infer tissue—specificity.
Furthermore, they threshold expression values, often using ad looc
choices of thresholds to classify genes as either expressed or not.
Finally, it is hard to integrate expression datasets from multiple plat—
forms, or from multiple laboratories, into a single framework. These
constraints are primarily dictated by limitations of high—throughput
technologies for assaying gene expression. In these technologies, one
can easily compare expression of the same gene across different sam—
ples to perform differential analysis; however, expression of differ—
ent genes in the same sample are not directly comparable due to
technical biases, differences in baseline expression, and G/C
(genome—wide association studies) content of genes. A recently pro—
posed method, Universal exPression Code (UPC; Piccolo et al.,
2013), addresses many of these issues by removing platform—specific
biases and converting raw expressions to a unified transcriptional
activity score. These scores are properly normalized and can be com—
pared across different genes and platforms.

Leveraging the UPC method, we propose a novel approach that
uses the topological context of an interaction to infer its specificity
score. Our approach formulates the inference problem as a suitably
regularized convex optimization problem. The objective function of
the optimization problem has two terms—the first term corresponds
to a diffusion kernel that propagates activity of genes through inter—
actions (network links). The second term is a regnlarizer that penal—
izes differences between transcriptional and functional activity
scores. We use these functional activity scores to compute tissue—
specificity for each edge in the global interactome, which we show,
through a number of validation tests, are significantly better than
prior methods. Our method is widely applicable and can be applied
directly to single—channel, double—channel and RNA—Seq expression
datasets processed using UPC/SCAN. Furthermore, it can be easily
adapted to cases where expression profiles are only available in pre—
processed form.

The rest of the article is organized as follows: in Section 2.1, we
provide details of the datasets used in our study. Next, we intro—
duce our method, called Activity Propagation (ActPro), and pro—
vide a consistent notation to formalize previous methods. We
evaluate the effectiveness of UPC transcriptional activity scores to
predict tissue—specific genes in Section 3.1. Details of procedure for
constructing tissue—specific networks and their parameter choices
are discussed in Section 3.2. Section 3.3 provides qualitative assess—
ment of our tissue—specific networks, whereas Sections 3.4—3.6 pre—
sent validation studies for tissue—specific interactions using known
pathway edges, co—annotation of proteins, and genome—wide asso—
ciation studies (GWAS) disease genes. Finally, in Section 3.7, we
use the brain—specific interactome constructed using our method to
identify novel disease—related pathways and use them to identify
candidate targets for neurodegenerative disorders.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Datasets

We downloaded the RNA—Seq dataset version 4.0 (dbGaP accession
p175000424.v4.p1) from the Genotype—Tissue Expression (GTEx)
project (Ardlie et al., 2015; Mele et al., 2015). This dataset contains
2916 samples from 30 different tissues/cell types, the summary of
which is presented in Figure 1. We processed each sample using the
UPC method (Piccolo et al., 2013), a novel platform—independent
normalization technique that corrects for platform—specific technical
variations and estimates the probability of transcriptional activity
for each gene in a given sample. The benefit of this method is that
activation probability scores are highly consistent across different
technologies, and more importantly, they are comparable across dif—
ferent genes in a given sample. For each gene, we recorded the tran—
script with the highest activation probability in the sample. Finally,
we averaged replicate samples within each group to construct a
unique transcription signature vector for each tissue/cell type. The
final dataset contains the expression value of 23 243 genes across 30
different tissues/cell types.

In addition, we extracted human protein—protein interactions
from the iRefIndex database (Razick et al., 2008), which consoli—
dates protein interactions from different databases. Edges in this
dataset are weighted using an MI (MINT—Inspired) score, which
measures the confidence of each interaction based on three different
evidence types, namely (i) the interaction types (binary/complex)
and experimental method used for detection, (ii) the total number of
unique PubMed publications reporting the interaction and (iii) the
cumulative evidence of interlogous interactions from other species.
Finally, we map transcription data to the human interactome by
converting all gene IDs to Entrez Gene IDs and only retaining genes
that both have a corresponding node in the interactome and have
been profiled by the GTEx project. This yields a global interactome
with 147 444 edges, corresponding to protein—protein interactions,
between 14 658 nodes, representing gene products.

2.2 Constructing human tissue—specific interactome

The global human interactome is a superset of all possible physical
interactions that can take place in the cell. It does not provide any
information as to which interactions actually occur in a given con—
text. There are a variety of factors, including co—expression of genes
corresponding to a pair of proteins, their co—localization, and post—
translational modification, that mediate protein interactions at the
right time and place. Quantifiable expression of both proteins
involved in an interaction is one of the most important factors that
determine the existence of an interaction. Different methods have
been proposed in literature to utilize this source of information to

construct human tissue—specific interactomes. Here, we briefly re—
view existing methods, their drawbacks, and propose a new method,
called ActPro, which addresses noted shortcomings.

2.2.1 Prior methods
Let us denote the adjacency matrix of the global interactome by A,
where element a,,- is the weight (confidence) of the edge connecting
vertices v,- and v,-. Let z encode expression of genes in a tissue and g
be the binarized version of z for a fixed threshold. Finally, let diag
operator applied to a given vector be the diagonal matrix with the
vector on the main diagonal. Our aim is to compute a matrix A,
which is the adjacency matrix of the tissue—specific interactome for a
given expression profile. Using this notation, we can summarize
prior methods for constructing tissue—specific interactomes as
follows.

NR: This method computes the induced subgraph of the ‘ex—
pressed’ gene products (Bossi and Lehner, 2009).

A : diag(§) * A * diag(§) (1)

ERW: This method penalizes edges according to the expression
state (activejinactive) of its end points (Magger et al., 2012). Given a
penalty parameter 0 S rw S 1, ERW penalizes each edge by rw
once, if only one of its endpoints is active, and twice, if both incident
vertices are inactive. Formally:

A : diag(rul(e_5)) >r< A >r< wagon/(81)), (2)

where e is the vector of all ones.

2.2.2 Proposed method

The main assumption of ERW and NR methods is that transcrip-
tional activity of a gene is a reliable proxy for its functional activity.
While this holds in a majority of cases, there are situations in which
these scores differ significantly. First, the basis for transcriptional ac-
tivity estimation is that genes with higher expression levels have
higher chance of being functionally active in a given context. While
this is generally true, there are genes that only need a low expression
level to perform their function, i.e. their functionally active concen—
tration is much lower than the rest of genes. Second, there is noise
associated with measurement of gene expression, and converting
measured expression values to UPC scores can over/under—estimate
transcriptional activity. Finally, we note that there are genes whose
down-regulation corresponds to their functional activity (as opposed
to the other way around).

Based on these observations, we propose a novel framework,
called ActPro to identify the most functionally active subnetwork of
a given interactome. Our method incorporates global network top—
ology to propagate activity scores, while simultaneously minimizing
the number of changes to the gene activity scores. To this end, we
first define a smoothed functional activity score defined by the fol—
lowing optimization problem:

. or 1 — or
x" : argm1n{mex +%  x — 
1Tx : 1 (3)
Subjectto:
0 S x

In this problem, L is the Laplacian matrix, defined as A — A,
where element 5,,- of A is the weighted degree of i—th vertex in the
global interactome. The Laplacian operator L acts on a given func—
tion defined over vertices of a graph, such as x, and computes the

smoothness of x over adjacent vertices. More specifically, we can ex—
pand the first term in Equation 5 as ZiaI-wiﬂx, — xi)2, which is the
accumulated difference of values between adjacent nodes scaled by
the weight of the edge connecting them. This term defines a diffu-
sion kernel that propagates activity of genes through network links.
The second term is a regularizer, which penalizes changes by enforc—
ing sparsity over the vector of differences between transcriptional
and functional activities. This minimizes deviation from original
transcriptome. It should be noted here that use of norm—1 is critical,
since norm—2 regularization blends the transcriptional activity scores
and significantly reduces their discriminating power. This negative
aspect of norm—2 minimization is confirmed by our experiments.
Finally, constraint 1Tx : 1 is known as the fixed budget. It ensures
that vector x is normalized and bounded. Parameter or determines
the relative importance of regularization versus loss. We can equiva—
lently define a penalization parameter A : 1f“, which is the standard
notation in optimization framework. This problem is a classical con—
vex optimization problem and we can solve it using efficient solvers
to identify its global optimum.

After solving Equation 5, we first scale xl by  These scores
are centered around 1, which allows us to perform minimal changes
to the weight of interactions in the global interactome. Using these
smoothed activity scores, we can reweight the global human interac—
tome as follows:

A : diag(x*) >r< A >r< diag(x*) (4)

We can also derive an alternative formulation for ActPro which,
instead of using transcriptional activity scores computed by UPC,
uses expression values computed through more common methods
such as RMA or MAS5.0 (Lim et al., 2007). We call this method
penalty propagation, or PenPro for short. In this framework, com—
puted expression values are not directly comparable and we need to
threshold them to classify genes as either expressed or not. Using the
same notation defined previously, we can define functional activity
scores by solving the following problem:

. 1 —
x" : argm1n{ixLx+(‘—u)  x —§|l1}
x

lEl V)
1% : 1 (5)
Subjectto:
0 < x

The only difference here is that, instead of transcriptional activ-
ity vector z, we use the binarized expression vector g. We observe
similar performance for ActPro and PenPro, with ActPro being mar—
ginally superior in all cases, and thus we will only present results for
ActPro.

2.3 Implementation details

All codes used in our experiments have been implemented in
MATLAB. To solve the convex problem in Equation 5, we used
CVX, a package for specifying and solving convex programs (Grant
and Boyd, 2008). We used Mosek together with CVX, which is a
high—performance solver for large—scale linear and quadratic pro—
grams (MOSEK—ApS, 2015).

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Transcriptional activity scores predict tissue—
specificity of genes

To validate the quality of UPC normalized expression values, we
first analyze the distribution of gene expressions across all tissues.

Figure 2(a) shows the distribution of transcriptional activities, aver—
aged over all samples. The overall distribution exhibits a bimodal
characteristic that has a clear separation point that distinguishes ex—
pressed genes from others. We set a global threshold of 0.75 for
identifying genes that are expressed in each tissue. These genes are
used in evaluating NR and ERW methods. It should be noted that
the distribution of UPC values varies across cell types, as shown in
Figure 2(b); however, the separation point is robust.

Expression value of genes across tissues can be classified as spe-
cific, selective or HK. HK genes are ubiquitously expressed across
all tissues to perform core cellular functions. On the other hand, tis—
sue specific/ tissue—selective genes are uniquely expressed in a given
tissue context to perform tissue—specific functions. These genes typ—
ically reside in the periphery of the network, are enriched among sig—
naling and cell surface receptors and are highly associated with the
onset of tissue—specific disorders(Yeger—Lotem and Sharan, 2015 ).
Figure 3(a) shows the total number of genes identified in each tissue
as preferentially expressed (either specific or selective). Testis tissue
exhibits the largest number of preferentially expressed genes (we
refer to these as markers), with more than 1, 400 genes, while blood
samples have the fewest markers with only ~250 marker genes. In
order to assess whether the sets of preferentially expressed genes can
predict tissue—specific functions, we performed Gene Ontology (GO)
enrichment analysis over different sets of tissue—specific markers
using GOsummaries package in R/Bioconductor (Kolde, 2014).
This package uses g:Profiler (Reimand et al., 2011) as backend for
enrichment analysis and provides a simple visualization of the re—
sults as a word cloud. The coverage of available annotations for dif—
ferent tissues is not uniform, that is, some tissues are better
annotated for specific terms than the others. We chose six well—
annotated tissues with high, mid and low number of identified
markers for further study. We limited terms to the ones with at least
20 and at most 500 genes to avoid overly generic/specific terms.

Finally, we used a strong hierarchical filtering to remove duplicate
GO terms and thresholded terms at P—value of 0.05. Figure 3(b)
shows the enrichment word cloud for each tissue. It can be seen that
all terms identified here are highly tissue—specific and representative
of main functions for each tissue, which supports the validity of
computed transcriptional activity scores from UPC.

3.2 Constructing tissue—specific interactomes

NR and ERW methods need a predefined set of expressed genes in
each tissue to construct tissue—specific interactomes (or a given lower
bound to threshold expression values). We use the set of all genes
with transcriptional activity greater than or equal to 0.75 as the set
of expressed genes for these methods. We chose this threshold based
on the averaged distribution of gene expressions, as well as further
manual curation of genes at different thresholds.

NR method is known to disintegrate the network with stringent
expression values (Magger et al., 2012). To evaluate the performance
of NR over different expression thresholds and assess its sensitivity to
the choice of threshold, we computed the size of largest connected
components, while varying the value of expression threshold. Figure 4
shows stable behavior up to threshold value of 0.75, after which the
size of largest component exhibit a rapid shift and the network starts
to disintegrate. This suggests that the expression value of 0.75 is also
the optimal topological choice for NR method.

For the ActPro algorithm, we evaluated the results over three dif—
ferent values of or in set {0.15, 0.5, 0.85} and reported the result for
each case.

3.3 Qualitative characterization of tissue—specific
interactomes

A key feature of tissue specific networks is their ability to discrimin—
ate positive edges that manifest in each tissue from the entire set of
potential interactions in the global interactome. In case of NR and
ERW methods, it is easy to distinguish positive and negative edges:
every edge for which at least one of the endpoints is not expressed
can be classified as a negative edge. The latter method updates edge
weights, to account for expression of their endpoints, whereas the
former method sets a hard threshold to either include an edge or
not. In the case of ActPro, we first notice that the distribution of
edge weights is very different between ActPro and previous methods.
Whereas NR and ERW methods never increase the weight of an
edge, in ActPro edge weights can increase or decrease. This behav—
ior, however, is biased towards the positive end. To decompose each
network into its HK, positive, and negative subspaces, we use the
following strategy: for each tissue—specific network constructed by a
given method, we first compute the relative weight change between
the global interactome and the tissue—specific network. We then nor—
malize these changes using Z—score normalization and define posi—
tive and negative subspaces according to the sign of normalized
relative changes. We further define and separate HK edges as the
subset of positive edges that are positive in at least half of the tissues.
Figure 5 summarizes the average statistics for constructed networks
using different methods. As a general observation, ActPro classifies

fewer interactions as HK and provides more specific positive and
negative edges. Furthermore, as we increase the or parameter, repre—
senting the diffusion depth, we observe that these edges are more
evenly distributed across vertices. To give a concrete example, we
constructed the brain—specific network using ERW and ActPro
methods. Figure 6 illustrates the final statistics of the constructed
networks. Consistent with the average statistics, we observe much
smaller positive/negative nodes/edges in ERW.

3.4 Tissue—specific interactome predicts context—
sensitive interactions in known functional pathways

To evaluate the power of tissue—specific interactions in capturing
context—sensitive physical interactions in known pathways, we first
use Edge Set Enrichment Analysis (ESEA) to rank pathway edges ac—
cording to their gain/loss of mutual information in each tissue context
(Han et al., 2015 ). ESEA aggregates pathways from seven different
sources (KEGG; Reactome; Biocarta, NCI/Nature Pathway
Interaction Database; SPIKE; HumanCyc; and Panther) and repre—
sents them as a graph with edges corresponding to biological relation—
ships, resulting in over 2300 pathways spanning 130 926 aggregated
edges. It then uses an information—theoretic measure to quantify
dependencies between genes based on gene expression data and ranks
edges, accordingly. Formally, for each pathway edge, ESEA computes
the differential correlation score (EdgeScore) as follows:

EdgeSCOIC : MIall(i7/) _ MIcontrol 

where MIau is the mutual information of the gene expression profiles
for genes i and / across all cell types. Here, MImmml measures the
mutual information only in the given tissue context. Each edge can
be classified as either a gain of correlation (GoC), loss of correlation
(LoC) or no change (NC) depending on the value of EdgeScore. We
use GoC edges, that is, a pair of genes with positive gain of mutual
information in the tissue context, as true positive edges in each tis—
sue. Similarly, we use all positive edges in all tissues but the tissue of
interest as true negatives.

To assess agreement between ESEA scores over known pathway
edges and computed tissue—specific interactions, we rank all edges ac—
cording to the difference of their weights in the human tissue—specific
interactome compared with the global interactome and evaluate the
enrichment of true positive pathway edges among top—ranked edges.
We compute the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for
each tissue and average the area under the curve (AUC) gain, com—
pared with random baseline, over all tissues. Figure 7 presents the
relative performance of each method. All three configurations of the

ActPro algorithm are ranked at the top of the list—demonstrating the
superior performance of our proposed method.

To further investigate tissue—specific details for the top—ranked
method, ActPro with at = 0.15, we sorted AUC gain for each tissue,
shown in Figure 8. This plot exhibits high level of heterogeneity,
and surprisingly, four of the tissues had worse than random per—
formance. This was consistent across all of the methods. To further
understand this, we investigated the ranked list of edges and identi—
fied a high enrichment of edges with LoC among top—ranked edges.
We performed enrichment analysis over these negative edges and
identified significant tissue—specific functions among them, which
suggests that the poor observed performance for these tissues is
attributed to their misclassification as negative edges.

At the other end of the spectrum, Fallopian Tube, Vagina and
Cervix Uteri had consistently high AUC gain across different meth—
ods. Figure 9 shows the ROC curve for these tissues.

3.5 Tissue-specific interactions are enriched among
proteins with shared tissue-specific annotations

We hypothesize that tissue—specific edges are enriched with proteins
that participate in similar tissue—specific functions. To evaluate our
hypothesis, we collected a set of manually curated tissue—specific

tissues with less than 100 edges with known annotations. This re—

annotations. We use the same strategy employed in previous section
to identify the mean gain of AUC for each method, which is illus—
trated in Figure 10. It should be noted that the gain of AUC is much
smaller here than the case with ESEA edges, which can be attributed
to the sparsity of tissue—specific GO annotations. Unlike ESEA,
ActPro with at = 0.5 outperforms the case with at = 0.15.

Among the 10 tissues, Adipose and Muscle tissues performed
marginally better than the others with AUC of 0.59 and 0.58, re—
spectively. On the other hand, Lung tissue had the worst perform—
ance with lower than random AUC of 0.47.

3.6 Tissue-specific interactions densely connect genes
corresponding to tissue-specific disorders

Disease genes are densely connected to each other in the interac—
tome, which provides the basis for a number of methods for
network—based disease gene prioritization (Kohler et al., 2008).
Tissue—specific interactomes have been shown to have higher accur—
acy in predicting disease—related genes using the random—walk
method (Magger et al., 2012). More recently, Cornish et al. (2015)
used the concept of ‘geneset compactness’, and showed that the
average distance among nodes corresponding to a given disorder is
significantly smaller in tissue—specific networks, compared with an
ensemble of random graphs.

Here, we adopt this concept to measure how closely tissue—
specific genes related to human disorders are positioned in networks
constructed using different methods. First, we use a symmetric diffu—
sion process instead of Random Walk with Restart (RWR), which is
a better measure of distance. Second, we use an alternative random
model in which we hypothesize that genes corresponding to tissue—
specific disorders are strongly connected to each other, compared
with random genesets of the same size.

To validate our hypothesis, we gather genes corresponding to
tissue—specific disorders from a recent study (Himmelstein and
Baranzini, 2015). These genes are extracted from the GWAS
Catalog by mapping known associations to disease—specific loci.
Among a total of 99 disorders, we focused on the gold standard set
of 29 diseases with at least 10 high—quality primary targets. We suc—
cessfully mapped 27 of these diseases to GTEx tissues, which are
used for the rest of our study. Consistent with previous studies
(Magger et al., 2012), we observed a small subset of disease genes
not to be expressed in the tissue in which they cause pathology.
Among all disease genes, we only retained genes that are connected
in the global interactome and are expressed above 0.1 UPC score.

For a given tissue—specific interactome represented by its adja—
cency matrix, AT, we define a stochastic matrix S = A‘iATATi
where A is the diagonal matrix, with entries 5,, being the degree of

node i in the human tissue—specific interactome. Using this matrix,
we can compute degree—weighted random—walk scores among gene
pairs as:

P=n_@a—wr1 (n

We define the random—walk distance as dii = —log10(pii), after
replacing zero elements of P with e = 2‘52. Given a disease geneset
F, we measure its compactness as the normalized average of dis—
tances for all pairs of nodes in the geneset:

Ziyé/‘El'd‘l

Finally, we sampled without replacement, 100K vertex samples
of size |F| from the tissue—specific interactome and computed the
compactness for each of the samples, individually. We defined an
empirical P—value as the fraction of random instances with higher
compactness (lower K) compared with F. We removed disorders for
which none of the methods yield significant P—value given a thresh—
old of 0.05. The final dataset consists of 15 diseases with signifi—
cantly compact interactions. To combine the P—values for different
disorders, we use the Edgington method (Edgington, 1972). This
method gathers a statistic 8 = Zi=1 p, for a set of [2 given P-values,
and computes the meta P—value by assigning significance to 8 as:

W ’k (s—nk
_I _ 9
 1(il ’2! (l

The list of all individual and combined P—values is shown in
Table 1. In these experiments, ActPro (at = 0.85) had the most sig—
nificant results, closely followed by ActPro (at = 0.5). This suggests

that propagating information using diffusion kernel in ActPro en—
hances its prediction power for tissue—specific pathologies.
Furthermore, there are four diseases for which the global interac—
tome had more significant predictions compared with tissue—specific
networks, among which primary biliary cirrhosis and psoriasis had
the highest difference. This difference may be attributed to misclassi—
fication of disease/tissue in Himmelstein and Baranzini (2015 ), or
existence of cross tissue mechanisms of action for the disease.

3.7 Tissue-specific interactome identifies novel
disease-related pathways—case study in neurodege-
nerative disorders

We now investigate whether tissue—specific interactomes can help in
predicting novel pathways that are involved in the progression of
neurodegenerative disorders. We perform a case study of
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, both of which were among
disorders with high compactness in brain tissue. We use Prize—
Collecting Steiner Tree (PCST) algorithm to identify the underlying
pathway among disease—genes identified by GWAS studies.
Formally, PCST problem can be formulated as:

argmin{Zce—ley}, (10)

< v,e>ET e y

where T is an induced tree of the given graph, v and e are the set of ver—
tices and edges in T, respectively, ce is the cost of choosing edge e, and
by is the reward/prize of collecting node v. Similar methods have been
proposed previously to connect upstream signaling elements to down—
stream transcriptional effector genes (Tuncbag et al., 2012, 2013).

To identify disease—related pathways, we first prune non—specific
interactions in the network by removing vertices that have more
than 500 interactions. We transform edge confidence values (con—
ductances) to edge penalties (resistances) by inverting each edge
weight. Node prizes are defined as the ratio of their incident edges
that fall within disease—related genes to the total degree of a node.
We assigned a node prize of 1000 to disease genes to ensure that
they are selected as terminal nodes. Finally, we use a recent message
passing algorithm (Bailly—Bechet et al., 2011) to identify PCST
rooted at each disease—related gene and choose the best tree as the
backbone of the disease—related pathway. Over each node, we use a
maximum depth of 4 and l = 1 as parameters to the message passing
algorithm. Figure 11 shows final tissue—specific pathways for
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) network contains two distinct subnet—
works, one centered around CLTC and the other centered around
ABL1. PICALM, CLU, APOE and SORLI are all known genes
involved in AD, which are also involved negative regulation ofamyl-
oid precursor protein catabolic process. All four of these genes

genes marked in red, accordingly. The thickness of edges represents their confidence with tree edges marked as blue

converge on CLCT gene, but through different paths. PI CALM gene
is known to play a central role in clathrin—related endocytosis. This
protein directly binds to CLTC and recruits clathrin and adaptor
protein 2 (AP—2) to the plasma membrane (Carter, 2011). On the
other hand, CLU, APOE and SORLI are linked to the CLTC
through novel linker genes XRCC6, MAPT/BINI and GGZA/HGS,
respectively. Gamma—adaptin gene, GGA2, binds to clathrins and
regulates protein traffic between the Golgi network and the lyso—
some. This network is postulated to be an important player in AD
(Carter, 201 1). H GS gene is a risk factor age—related macular degen—
eration (AMD) and has been hypothesized to be a shared factor for
AD (Logue et al., 2014). Interestingly, MAPT, a novel marker iden—
tified in this study, is a risk factor for Parkinson’s disease and very
recently shown to also be linked to AD (Desikan et al., 2015). A se—
cond component in AD network is centered around ABL1 gene,
which, together with CBL, INPPL1, CDZAP and MAPT, shares the
SH3 domain binding function. INPPL1 gene, a metabolic syndrome
risk factor, has been hypothesized to link AD with the recently
posed term ‘type 3 diabetes’ (Accardi et al., 2012). Finally, we note

that MAPT gene is one of the central genes that link these two main
components, the role of which warrants further investigation.
Parkinson’s disease (PD) network, on the other hand, contains
one densely connected core centered around MAPT gene. There are
two main branches converging on MAPT. On the left, WNT3,
FZDI and GSK3 B constitute upstream elements of the WNT signal—
ing pathway, which is known to play an important role in PD neuro—
degeneration (Berwick and Harvey, 2012). GSK3 gene product is
postulated to directly interact with MAPT (r) and LRKKZ, while
implicitly regulating SNCA (or—Syn) in a li—cat dependent manner.
However, we observed direct interaction between GSK3B and
SNCA, and parallel pathways connecting it to LRRKZ via SNCA
and MAPT. Both SNCA and MAPT also take part in the right
branch, together with CAV1 and RH OA, which is enriched in react-
ive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic process. Accumulation of ROS
contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction and protein misfolding,
both of which are linked to progression of PD. RITZ enzyme is iden—
tified independently and confirmed as PD susceptibility factor
(Pankratz et al., 2012). Pankratz et al. also suggested CALM1 as the

bridge linking RITZ with MAPT and SNCA, which confirms our
findings. Cyclin G—associated kinase (GAK) is a known risk factor
for PD. We identified HSPA8 as a key link between GAK, WNT sig—
naling pathway, and CSNKIE with central PD genes, MAPT, SNCA
and LRRKZ. HSPA8 gene has been proposed as a biomarker for
diagnosis of PD (Lauterbach, 2013). Finally, myelin basic protein
(MBP) interacts closely with CALM1 and LRRKZ. This gene has
been previously shown to be differentially expressed in PD and pro—
posed as potential biomarker for PD (Kim et al., 2006).

In summary, we show that the brain—specific interactome derived
from our method helps in uncovering tissue—specific pathways that
are involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Similar analysis of other
human tissues can potentially contribute to identification of new
therapeutic targets for other human disorders.

4 Conclusion

In this article, we present a novel method for computing tissue—
specific interactomes from organism—specific interactomes and ex—
pression profiles of genes in various tissues. Our method casts the
problem as a convex optimization problem that diffuses functional
activity of genes over the organism—specific interactome, while sim—
ultaneously minimizing perturbation of transcriptional activity. We
show, using a number of validation studies, that the tissue—specific
interactomes computed by our method are superior to those com—
puted using existing methods. Finally, we show, using a case study
of brain—specific interactome for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s dis—
eases, that our method is capable of constructing highly resolved
disease—specific pathways, providing potential targets for novel
drugs.

Abstract

Summary: We here present BioCircos.js, an interactive and lightweight JavaScript library espe—
cially for biological data interactive visualization. BioCircos.js facilitates the development of web—
based applications for circular visualization of various biological data, such as genomic features,
genetic variations, gene expression and biomolecular interactions.

Availability and implementation: BioCircos.js and its manual are freely available online at http://bio

1 Introduction

Multi—faceted and complex biological data increasingly require
visualization and sophisticated analyses. However, suitable visual—
ization tools are not always available to come readily at hand.
Furthermore, many biological visualization tools are desktop appli—
cations that may be difficult to install and configure. Circos
(Krzywinski et (11., 2009) is a powerful Perl—based tool for illustrat—
ing genomic features, and is widely used in biological research.
However, the graphical files it outputs are not interactive and users
can thus not obtained further details by moving a mouse pointer
over the data points. Alternatives to Circos, such as Circoletto
(Darzentas, 2010), CIRCUS (Naquin et (11., 2014) and Rcircos
(Zhang et (11., 2013), are also not interactive, whereas J—Circos
(An et (11., 2015), though interactive, is a desktop software. Web

visualization applications have the advantage of generating inter—
active images in which all elements are interactive with mouse—over
explanations and clickable buttons, and are thus far more user—
friendly and provide more easily accessible information. As Circos
and its alternatives do not function well on web applications, an
interactive Circos—like tool for web applications would greatly fa—
cilitate visualization of biological data.

Based on the powerful D3 (Data—Driven Documents) (Bostock
et (11., 2011) and the jQuery JavaScript library, we have developed
BioCircos.js, an interactive and lightweight JavaScript library espe—
cially adapted for interactive visualization of biological data on web
applications. BioCircos.js thus facilitates the development of web
applications for visualization of biological data in a circular format
similar to that of Circos.

Fig. 1. Plots constructed with BioCircos.js. (A) Reproduced plots of published somatic mutations from a human cancer genome. The outer ring represents
chromosome ideograms. From outside and inwards, the data tracks represent insertions, deletions, heterozygous substitutions, homozygous substitutions, cod-
ing substitutions (silent in grey, missense in purple, nonsense in red and splice site in black), copy number variation, LOH and rearrangements. A detailed de-
scription can be found in Pleasance er al., 2010. (B) Circular visualization of protein domains, mutations and drug targeted mutations in EGFR. The outer ring
represents the positions of the amino acid in EGFR. The next four tracks (from outside and inwards) are protein domains, drug targeted indels (Deletion in exon
19 and insertion in exon 20, data from Shigematsu er al., 2005), drug targeted mutations (L858R and T790M) and mutations (data from the lntOGen database;

Gonzalez-Perez er al., 2013) in the CDS respectively

2 Implementation

BioCircos.js is written in JavaScript and generates interactive graph—
ics with SVG element based on D3 (Data—Driven Documents) and
jQuery. BioCircos.js itself is not a web application, but a library that
provides the functionality to build Circos—like web tools.

BioCircos.js provides the SNP, CNV, HEATMAP, LINK, LINE,
SCATTER, ARC and HISTGRAM modules to display genome—wide
genetic variations (SNPs, CNVs and chromosome rearrangement),
gene expression and biomolecular interactions. BioCircos.js pro—
vides the BACKGROUND module to display background and axis
circles, and also provides the TEXT module to facilitate the annota—
tion of elements. Tooltips showing detailed information of SVG
elements are also provided. With Twitter Bootstrap as the front—end
framework, tooltips have an increased number of styles. A detailed
document is available on the website.

BioCircos.js supports multiple—platforms and works in all major
internet browsers (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Mozilla
Firefox, Safari, Opera). Its speed is determined by the client’s hard—
ware and the internet browser used.

3 Results

The main differences between BioCircos.js and Circos are threefold.
(i) BioCircos.js provides a convenient way to construct web—based ap—
plications for interactive visualization of biological data in a circular
format. Additionally, BioCircos.js can generate high quality SVG vec—
tor graphics. (ii) BioCircos.js is written in web client—side JavaScript,
and can thus take advantages of many web features to achieve useful
interactive effects, such as binding mouse events to data points, ani—
mation effects, etc, which are not available to the Perl—based Circos.

We consider this is the most important advantage of BioCircos.js. (iii)
Biocircos.js can be used by conjunction with standard browsers,
thereby circumventing a number of problems, such as fixing depend—
encies or upgrading Perl modules, which is often necessary to perform
when installing Circos on a local computer.

To demonstrate the utility of BioCircos.js in generating circular
images of biological data, we attempted to reproduce published
Circos plots using BioCircos.js. A study published in 2010 reported
a comprehensive catalogue of somatic mutations from a human can—
cer genome (Pleasance et 41]., 2010). We obtained all necessary data
from the supplementary materials, including insertions, deletions,
substitutions, copy number variations, loss of heterozygosity
(LOH), and rearrangements, and used BioCircos.js to reproduce the
plot containing all mutations (Fig. 1A). For example, we reproduced
substitutions using SCATTER modules, and rearrangements using
the LINK modules. A detailed description of data tracks can be
found in Pleasance et a1. (2010).

Figure 1A shows the ability to visualize multi—faceted biological
data. Figure 1B shows how BioCircos.js can be used to visualize
other types of biological data, in this case the amino acid sequence
of the EGFR. The protein domains and SNPs in CD5 are displayed
using the ARC and SCATTER modules (Gonzalez—Perez et 41].,
2013; Shigematsu et 41]., 2005), so that the further away an SNP is
located from the center, the higher its mutational frequency in popu—
lation. Drug targeted mutations and indels are also displayed in the
plot, all drug targeted mutations being located in the kinase domain.
The mutation L85 8R (target of Afatinib, Iressa and Tarceva) has a
higher frequency in population, and Figure 1B clearly demonstrates
the significance of L858R in drug design. To further illustrate the
utility of BioCircos.js, we have provided three additional examples
in the supplementary.

4 Conclusion and outlook

BioCircos.js is not a web application for end—users but a JavaScript
library for programmers. Developers need to write code around
BioCircos.js to build web applications. BioCircos.js provides ﬂexible
and powerful functionality for the development of web—based circu—
lar visualization tools for multi—faceted biological data. These appli—
cations will be developed as plugins to simplify the process of
generating circular image. We will continue to develop BioCircos.js
to provide more features and support to the research community.

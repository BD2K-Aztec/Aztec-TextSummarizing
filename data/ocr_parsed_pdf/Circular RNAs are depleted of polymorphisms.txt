did not ﬁt the boundaries, they were extended to the circRNA bound-
aries. In case no ‘best transcript’ was reported, we looked for miRNA
complementary motifs in the circRNA unspliced sequence to identify
which possible exons would ﬁt the reported motif positions and the tran-
script length. More generally, we checked that the mature circRNA se-
quence ﬁt the reported transcript length, circRNA boundaries and
reported miRNA binding site positions. Some reported miRNA binding
site positions did not ﬁt sequential ordering of the exons, but a permu-
tated order, in which case we permutated the exon order to automatically
ﬁnd the order that ﬁts the miRNA site positions. The permutated order
was only used to check reported miRNA binding site positions, to make
sure we identiﬁed the correct exon boundaries; the sequential exon order
was used in the analysis of this study. Finally, a special case happened for
circRNA hsa_circ_0016l9, where one intron of the RefSeq gene was
considered as exon in the circRNA gene, to ﬁt reported transcript
length and reported miRNA binding site positions.

2.3 MicroRNA seed motifs and miRNA families

MicroRNA motifs were deﬁned as nucleotides 24; from the 5’ end of the
2578 mature human miRNA sequences, resulting in 2043 different motifs.
Only considering human miRNAs also found in other organisms
(miRNA families deﬁned in the miRBase ﬁle miFam.dat) resulted in
1081 motifs.

2.4 Detection of miRNA-binding motifs in circRNAs

Circular RNA sequences were generated from exon positions of
circRNAs, together with the human genome assembly. MicroRNA
motif search was carried out for each reverse complementary motif in
each circRNA sequence.

2.5 Distribution of SNPs at miRNA binding motif loci

For each unique motif locus identiﬁed, we looked for SNPs lying within
the motif and in the 50 bp up- and down-stream regions on the transcript.
SNP positions were calculated relative to the 3’ end of the reverse com-
plement of the motif, i.e. the 5’ end of the miRNA mature sequence. In
case of polymorphisms with a length different from one nucleotide, the 3’
end position of the variant was used. Polymorphism counts around
miRNA target sites were normalized by dividing by the median count,
so that the baseline value was one. Average SNP densities around
miRNA target sites were computed at each position relative to the
seed’s 5’ ends, and reported SNP density values were estimated by the
median density at positions 277 for the seed and the median density at
50 bp up- and down-stream of the seed for the ﬂanks (excluding seed
positions 178). SNP density ratios were deﬁned as the ratio of median
SNP density in seed over median SNP density in ﬂanks.

2.6 Randomization

All possible motifs of seven nucleotides (47 = 16384 possibilities) were
generated, and the motif search was carried out for each of these motifs in
the circRNAs. We searched for SNPs at each identiﬁed locus and within
the 50 bp up- and down-stream regions, resulting in a list of positions
relative to the motif’s 3’ end for each locus. By sampling 2043 unique
motifs without replacement (1081 for the miRNA-family ﬁltered subset)
from the 16 384 possible motifs, their previously identiﬁed motif positions
could then be used to get their corresponding motif sites, and SNP pos-
itions relative to them, to compute SNP distribution for random motifs.
The sampling procedure was repeated 1000 times resulting in 1000 distri-
butions. Each distribution was normalized by dividing by its median
count. For the randomized distributions, median and 95% conﬁdence
interval (CI) at each position relative to the motif site, were computed
and compared with the actual distribution computed from all known
miRNA motifs and from miRNA family-based motifs. To estimate

P-values for a given SNP density ratio, we computed SNP density
ratios of the random distributions. We checked that those random
ratios were normally distributed and used them to compute normal Z
scores, which were used together with the normal probability function to
estimate P-values of the decrease in SNP density at seed sites.

2.7 Distribution of SNPs at splice sites

Similar to the SNP distribution around miRNA binding motifs, we com-
puted the SNP distribution around splice sites by looking at SNP pos-
itions relative to exon starts or ends, and separating them according to
circRNA strands. Distributions were corrected for strand, and those
around exon starts on the positive strand and exon ends on the negative
strand were grouped together, and vice versa. For each splice site type
(5’ or 3’), we normalized the distributions by dividing by the median SNP
count, and we took the median of the 2-nt-long SNP densities, and the
median SNP density in corresponding intron and exon distributions to
compute SNP density ratios. Also, we checked that the SNP densities in
each group (introns, exons) are normally distributed and computed splice
site Z-scores in each of the corresponding intron and exon distributions.
Finally, we computed P-values for SNP densities in splice sites compared
with SNP density in introns or exons, by comparing the Z-scores with the
normal probability function. P-values comparing intron and exon SNP
densities were given by t-tests.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

After identifying unambiguously the precise exon positions of the
1953 human circRNA transcripts reported by Memczak et a].
(2013), we searched for 6mer, 7mer and 8mer seed sites for each
of the 2043 human miRNA seed motifs within the 1906 circRNA
sequences that mapped to the 22 autosomes. The search resulted
in a total of 1716022 different unique loci including, respect—
ively, 59.9, 21.9, 28.0 and 10.2% 6mer, 7merA1, 7merM8 and
8mer sites (Table 1). When only considering the 1081 motifs from
miRNA families, corresponding to miRNAs that are evolution—
ary conserved, 1061 146 different unique loci were identiﬁed in
total (including respectively 57.4, 21.0, 24.0 and 8.7% 6mer,
7merA1, 7merM8 and 8mer sites).

We computed SNP distributions of 50 bp around the identiﬁed
seed sites. The 1716 022 loci and their ﬂanking sequences har—
boured a median count of 1.47 SNP per 100 bp (SNP/hbp), and
1.35 SNP/hbp for the 6bp of the seed sites that match nucleo—
tides 277 of the miRNA seed motifs (Table 1). Consequently, we
saw an 8% decrease of SNP density at 6mer seed sites compared
with their ﬂanking regions. Importantly, the seed sites more
likely to cause strong miRNA regulation (Grimson et al., 2007)
had a higher decrease in SNP density compared with their ﬂank—
ing regions, such that 8mer seed sites of conserved miRNAs had
a 17% decrease in SNP density.

To check that the density decrease between seed sites and
ﬂanks was not an artefact of the method, we repeated our
SNP density analysis 1000 times by sampling 2043 random
motifs of seven nucleotides and computing SNP distributions.
The randomization data were used to compute median and
95% CI distributions of SNP densities (as shown in black and
grey in Figs 1 and 2). The randomization showed a larger vari—
ability in SNP density at the seed site than in ﬂanking regions,
but still the density from miRNA seed motifs was much lower
than the 95% CI (P = 4.4 x 10’“; see Table 1), suggesting that

distributions because nucleotides at that position in the motif
cannot be A but only T, C or G, which are more likely to be
reference alleles than if A was also included. Therefore, the in—
creases and decreases at position 0 are artefacts because of differ—
ences in reference allele probabilities. Further analyses of the
miRNA targeting variables from TargetScan (Garcia et al.,
2011) (see Supplementary Methods) showed that there is still an
SNP density depletion at seed sites (see Supplementary Results).
However, miRNA motifs with CG dinucleotides (CpG) were
more likely to harbour SNPs at complementary sites (see
Supplementary Results), as CpG sites are more likely to be
methylated and therefore mutated.

Our results showed that the SNP density decrease in circRNAs
ranges from 8 to 17%, which ﬁts results from previous studies
that reported an SNP density decrease ranging from 10 to 16%
(Mu et al., 2011) for miRNA binding on mRNAs (excluding
6mers) depending on the location in 3’ UTR. Similarly, it is
known that mRNA exons harbour decreased SNP density com—
pared with introns (Mu et al., 2011). Therefore, we looked at
splice sites of circRNAs and conﬁrmed the signiﬁcant decreased
SNP density at circRNA exons, and particularly at splice sites
(Fig. 3 and Table 2). The strong selection against SNPs at splice
sites likely reﬂects that splicing is essential in circRNA
maturation.

4 CONCLUSON

We found that circRNAs have a decreased SNP density at
miRNA seed sites compared with both ﬂanking regions and
SNP distributions at random seed motifs. This decrease was
comparable with previously reported SNP densities at miRNA
target sites in mRNA 3’ UTRs, suggesting that miRNA seed sites
within circRNAs have similar selective pressure as miRNA seed
sites within 3’ UTRs. Consequently, the sponge effect of
circRNAs on miRNAs may be as functionally important as
miRNA’s regulatory effect on mRNAs.

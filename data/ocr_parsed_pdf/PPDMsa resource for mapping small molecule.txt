Abstract

Summary: PPDMs is a resource that maps small molecule bioactivities to protein domains from
the Pfam—A collection of protein families. Small molecule bioactivities mapped to protein domains
add important precision to approaches that use protein sequence searches alignments to assist ap—
plications in computational drug discovery and systems and chemical biology. We have previously
proposed a mapping heuristic for a subset of bioactivities stored in ChEMBL with the Pfam—A
domain most likely to mediate small molecule binding. We have since refined this mapping using a
manual procedure. Here, we present a resource that provides up—to—date mappings and the possi—
bility to review assigned mappings as well as to participate in their assignment and curation. We
also describe how mappings provided through the PPDMs resource are made accessible through
the main schema 0fthe ChEMBL database.

Availability and implementation: The PPDMs resource and curation interface is available at https://
www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/research/ppdms/pfamimaps. The source—code for PPDMs is available under
the Apache license at https://github.com/chembl/pfamimaps. Source code is available at https://
github.com/chembl/pfamimapiloader to demonstrate the integration process with the main
schema 0fChEMBL.

1 Introduction

Systematic analyses of bioactive small molecules and their molecular
targets and homologues form the basis of a number of novel applica-
tions in computational drug discovery and systems and chemical
biology, including methods of target prediction (Martinez—Jimenez
et (11., 2013), and for the establishment of functional relationships
between proteins (Kruger and Overington, 2012; Lin et (11., 2013;
van der Horst et (11., 2010). To add precision to these methods, we
have previously proposed a simple mapping heuristic of small mol-
ecule bioactivities to protein domains (Kruger et (11., 2012). Here,
we present a full implementation of the mapping to a relevant subset

of biological assays stored in the current version of the ChEMBL
database (Bento et (11., 2014). This implementation also accommo-
dates edge cases that were unaddressed in the original implementa-
tion—specifically cases where more than one Pfam-A domain could
mediate small molecule binding. In the refined implementation, such
cases were resolved manually. The PPDMs server provides a plat-
form to review and contribute manual assignments.

Previous computational approaches exist that link small mol-
ecule binding to specific protein domains, but these approaches use
information extracted from crystal structures of protein-ligand com-
plexes to transfer binding annotations between homologous proteins

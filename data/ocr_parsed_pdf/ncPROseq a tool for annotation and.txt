2 METHODS

The workﬂow of the ncPRO-seq pipeline is composed of ﬁve main steps:
input pre-processing, read mapping, read annotation, annotation ana-
lyses and enrichment analyses (Supplementary Fig. S1). The pipeline is
able to handle sequence ﬁles generated by Solexa, SOLiD and 454
sequencing technologies and alignment ﬁles in BAM format as inputs.
For sequence ﬁle inputs, the pipeline provides several ways to access the
basic properties of sequencing reads, such as distribution of read length,
positional base, mean positional quality score and GC content. An op-
tional step can be introduced, for both sequence and alignment inputs, by
merging reads with identical sequence into non-redundant read groups,
which dramatically improves the performance of the pipeline. Bowtie
(Langmead et al, 2009) is used to align reads to the reference genome.
The mapping statistics and length distribution of mapped reads are com-
puted to summarize mapping information. All reads, including those
matching multiple genomic locations (up to a user-deﬁned threshold),
are kept for subsequent analyses and weighted by the number of mapping
sites. To ﬁnd overlaps between read alignments and genomic annotations,
i.e. to match reads to ncRNA families according to genomic coordinates,
BEDTools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) is used. Annotation ﬁles for 15
species (including metazoans and plants), based on miRBase
(Kozomara and Grifﬁths-Jones, 2011), Rfam (Gardner et al, 2011),
RepeatMasker, splice site and tRNAs (Dreszer et al, 2012), are pre-
computed and now available for download in the ncPRO-seq web site.
Custom annotation ﬁles in gff3 format are also acceptable, which will be
considered as user-deﬁned ncRNA families and be processed in the same
way as known ncRNA families. Four types of operations are provided to
help users focus on subregions or regions ﬁanking given annotations
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Analyses are then performed for reads that
have 100% overlap with annotations. Reads annotated as major anno-
tation families, as well as each family of Rfam and repeats, are counted
and plotted to provide a systematic view of read annotations. For each
annotation family, the table containing the expression of reads in each
single member and the track ﬁle for visualization are created. To obtain
detailed family-based information, read proﬁling and read logos for each
family are computed. Read proﬁling is represented by the distribution of
read coverage along the consensus sequence and by the distribution of
read length (Supplementary Fig. S3). Read logos describe the positional
base bias in all reads mapped in the family. For reads that cannot be
annotated as known features, a sliding-window process coupled with
model ﬁtting is performed to identify regions that are signiﬁcantly en-
riched with such reads (Toedling et al, 2010).

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The ncPRO—seq pipeline can be used in a Linux/Unix—like oper—
ating system, where several required softwares have been
pre—installed. Two different ways of running the pipeline are
provided, a stand—alone command line version and a local web
interface. Both versions require a configuration ﬁle to set up the
analysis parameters. After editing the conﬁguration ﬁle, the user
can easily run the complete analysis workflow with a simple
command line. The pipeline is modular and sequential, which
allows the user to focus on a speciﬁc part of the pipeline without
running the complete workﬂow. The pipeline also provides a
local web interface (Supplementary Fig. S4), which offers the
possibility to set up the parameters of the conﬁguration files in
a user—friendly way, to run the pipeline. Finally, an online version
for small datasets and tests is also available at http://ncpro.curie
.fr/online.html.

4 OUTPUT

After running ncPRO—seq, an html report is generated, facilitat—
ing the visualization of the results that are organized under dif—
ferent web tabs. Besides essential tabs containing information
about pipeline performance, tables and ﬁgures of read quality
controls, mapping and annotations, each annotation family spe—
ciﬁed by the user has an independent tab displaying the results of
detailed proﬁling analyses. All images and tables generated by
the pipeline can be visualized at high resolution or downloaded
for further analysis. An example of a report from a test library is
available at http://ncpro.curie.fr/results.html.

5 CONCLUSION

The ncPRO—seq pipeline provides a comprehensive approach for
the annotation and prediction of small ncRNAs in sRNA—seq
data. The pipeline can analyse different annotation families
rather than just focusing on miRNAs. Various sequence and
alignment inputs from different metazoan and plant genomes
are supported. The great advantage of the pipeline over others
is the capacity to perform proﬁling analyses of annotation
families, which is critically important to investigate known
small ncRNA families and to define novel small ncRNA families.
The significant regions predicted in the pipeline can be further
interpreted to identify novel miRNA loci and siRNA clusters.

(generally following log transformation), the contribution of the
ith observation to the likelihood is:

{(1 —p,~>+p,~<1>[(T — won“— 5”{p,~ - exp[—(y — u.)2/202]N27w}5‘

where p,- represents the probability of metabolite detection in the
ith sample, T is the threshold of detectability and (Si is an indica—
tor equal to 1 if the metabolite is detected and 0 otherwise. A
logistic model is speciﬁed for p,, log(p,-/(1ip,-))=x,-’ﬂ, where x,-
and ﬂ are the covariate and parameter vectors, respectively.
A linear model is speciﬁed for the mean of the observed response,
ui, with ui= zi’ot, where z,- and at are the covariate and parameter
vectors, respectively.

2.2 Function descriptions

metabomxtr has two main functions: mxtrmod and
mxtrmodLRT. mxtrmod executes mixture models, taking as
inputs response variable names, a model formula and a data
object (a matrix of values with NA to indicate missingness or
an ExpressionSet R object). It returns optimized parameter esti—
mates and the corresponding negative log likelihood value.
Parameter vectors at and ﬂ are estimated using maximum likeli—
hood using the optimx package. By default, T is set to the min—
imum observed metabolite abundance. Use of mxtrmod on the
example dataset metabdata follows:

> data(metabdata)

> metabnames<—colnames(metabdata)[11:20]

+ storageTimesYearsimc
> redModRes<-mxtrmod (metabnames , mxtrModel=redModel ,
+ data=metabdata, fullModel=fullModel>

To evaluate the signiﬁcance of speciﬁc covariates,
mxtrmodLRT implements nested model likelihood ratio X2
tests. Required arguments include mxtrmod output for full and
reduced models and, if desired, method of multiple comparisons
adjustment. mxtrmodLRT outputs a data frame of negative log
likelihoods, X2 statistics, degrees of freedom and P—values for
each metabolite.

2.3 Comparison with imputation

To illustrate mixture models, we re—analyzed a subset of GC—MS
data on 115 fasting serum samples from pregnant women
involved in the population—based Hyperglycemia and Adverse
Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study, contained in the example
data (Scholtens et al., 2014). A total of 49 non—targeted metab—
olites with at least five missing values were analyzed using mix—
ture modeling as well as minimum imputation and ﬁve nearest
neighbors. The predictor of interest was high (>90th percentile)
versus low (<10th percentile) fasting plasma glucose (FPG).
Samples for this pilot study were selected such that 67 had
high FPG and 48 had low FPG. For minimum and nearest

neighbor imputation, FPG groups were compared after imput—
ation using linear models adjusted for study field center, parity,
maternal and gestational age and sample storage time. The con—
tinuous portion of the mixture model also included these covari—
ates, whereas the discrete portion included only FPG. FPG was
removed for reduced models in mixture—model analysis. Nominal
P<0.01 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Of 49 metabolites analyzed, there was complete agreement (all
significant or non—signiﬁcant) among methods on 39 of them. Of
the remaining 10 (Supplementary Fig. and Supplementary
Table), mixture models detected signiﬁcant effects for 7, nearest
neighbor 4 and minimum 4. Of the seven mixture—model identi—
fications, three were also detected by nearest neighbor, two also
by minimum imputation and two were unique identiﬁcations.
The mixture—model results were discussed from a biological per—
spective by Scholtens et a]. (2014) and include leucine and pyru—
vic acid. One signiﬁcant metabolite finding was unique to nearest
neighbor imputation, but the result is questionable because the
median of the imputed values exceeded the observed median,
inconsistent with the notion of low abundance. For the two sig—
niﬁcant effects unique to minimum imputation, mixture—model
P—values approached signiﬁcance (0.018, 0.011), suggesting ap—
proximate agreement between the two methods.

3 DISCUSSION

The R package metabomxtr facilitates mixture—model analysis of
non—targeted metabolomics data. Re—analysis of the HAPO pilot
metabolomics data indicates that mixture—model analysis detects
metabolites identiﬁed by other common imputation approaches
and additionally identiﬁes associations that would otherwise be
missed. Rigorous testing of mixture models on a wider scale is
warranted. In summary, metabomxtr provides metabolomics re—
searchers a previously unavailable tool for handling non—targeted
metabolomics missingness.

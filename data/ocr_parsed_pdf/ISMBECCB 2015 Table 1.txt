contributors of all the papers. We recognize that the process is not
perfect, and some outstanding work might have been rejected des—
pite our best efforts. Nonetheless, we are hopeful that all authors
received helpful feedback on their work and that most believed
their submissions were judged fairly and diligently. In total, the
two—tier review process involved 896 individual reviews. We are im—
mensely grateful to the Area Chairs, the members of the program
committee and the external subreviewers for their outstanding efforts
in conducting a thorough review process in just 3 months. Their con—
tribution is at the core of the scientific quality of the conference. We
also thank Steven Leard for his continuing support with the review
process; the team at Oxford University Press for preparing this spe—
cial proceedings volume and the Conference Chairs, Janet Kelso and
Alex Bateman, the Theme Chairs and other members of the ISMB

Steering Committee for their advice and supervision. We are also
grateful to Russell Schwartz, Proceedings Chair of ISMB 2014, for
sharing his experience and various helpful documents on the review
process.

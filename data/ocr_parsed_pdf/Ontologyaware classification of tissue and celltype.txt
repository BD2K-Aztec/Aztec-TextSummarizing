2.2 Expression data preparation

The Supplementary raw CEL ﬁles of gene expression samples were down-
loaded from GEO, and their probes were mapped to Entrez GeneIDs
using the BrainArray Custom CDF (Barrett et al., 2011; Dai et al., 2005).
To compare methods across different preprocessing techniques, expres-
sion data were processed using each of the three alternative preprocessing
algorithms: MAS5.0, fRMA and Barcode (Hubbell et al., 2002; McCall
et al., 2010, 2011). Default parameters and subroutines were used for each
preprocessing approach. Additionally, the absolute expression values
from the standard MAS5.0 were log transformed. As our method aims
at classifying single expression proﬁles, series-based preprocessing tech-
niques (i.e. RMA) were excluded from our study (Irizarry et al., 2003).
The Illumina Human Bodymap 2.0 RNA-seq data (GSE30611) was
downloaded from GEO and mapped to NCBI’s transcript reference
using the Bowtie and Tophat alignment algorithms with default param-
eters (Langmead et al., 2009; Trapnell et al., 2009). For tissue/cell-type
prediction, FPKM transcript expression values were given as input to our
hgu133plus2-trained method. Data transformation and signiﬁcance test
for RNA-seq (and cross platform) experiments are explained later in this
section.

2.3 Individual tissue and cell-type classifiers

Labeling positive and negative samples correctly is essential for any ac-
curate classiﬁer. Conventional multilabel classiﬁcation assumes that all
labels are mutually exclusive. For example in our study, macrophage
samples would be considered negative examples when classifying for
leukocytes, ignoring the fact that macrophages are merely a speciﬁc type
of leukocytes (Fig. 1b). Using the tissue ontology, we thus reconsider the
positive and negative samples for each individual tissue and cell-type
classiﬁer. For a given tissue term, samples annotated directly to that
term or any of its descendant terms (i.e. cell-types) are now considered
positive; samples annotated to only its ancestor terms are excluded from
training; and the remaining samples annotated to other term in the ontol-
ogyiincluding sibling termsiare considered negative. Now, macrophage
samples would be considered positive examples for the leukocyte classi-
ﬁer. This re-labeling is based on the very design of the tissue ontology,
and consequently expands the number of positive examples and removes
ambiguous examples.

Each individual tissue or cell-type is ﬁrst classiﬁed using an independ-
ent one-versus—all support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁer using the
ontology-aware training standard. SVM maximizes the margin between
positive (i.e. y = 1) and negative (i.e. y: —1) examples and ﬁnds a linear
decision boundary without any assumptions of the probability distribu-
tions (Burges, 1998). Given l pairs (i.e. samples) of expression data xi and
its label y, we use the L2 linear SVM (with the default cost parameter)
implemented in the LIBLINEAR software (Fan et al., 2012):

 wTw + C21:1 max(1 —y,»wTX,»,0)2

where C > 0 is the cost parameter, and w the linear decision boundary (i.e.
feature weight vector). Bayesian correction (explained later in text) is
trained and applied using the SVM outputs 91,. . . ,yN of these N cell-
type-speciﬁc models.

2.4 Bayesian network correction

We use the structure of the tissue ontology as a framework of the
Bayesian network (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2). We model each
term’s SVM output as a random event y,- and treat it as a noisy obser-
vation of a latent binary event y,- representing the true label (i.e. cell-type)
of a given sample (Fig. 1b). The edges from y to y impose the independ-
ence of the noisy random variable y,- to all other noisy variables y) (1' 75 j)
given its true label y,-. This allows us to calculate the likelihood:

A A N A
P01,  ,y/v lyl,  ,yN) = Hi21P0/ilyi)

The distribution of positive and negative unthresholded SVM outputs
varies across different terms (i.e. cell-types), and so the output values were
dynamically binned based on the number of positive examples and their
range. These empirical distributions represent the conditional probabil-
ities P07,- | y,-= 0) and P07,- | y,-= 1). The conditional probability table for
each term was estimated based on a 2-fold cross-validation that never
split datasets between folds to mitigate potential batch effects. Laplace
smoothing was applied for robustness.

The parentwhild conditional probability tables were deﬁned as in the
original Bayesian correction method (Barutcuoglu et al., 2006).
Intuitively, constant priors of 0.5 were assigned to leaf nodes, and the
whole-body root node was assigned a probability of 1. This root assign-
ment allows potential dependencies between every latent variable. This
allows us to calculate the prior:

Pol,  m = 11:, Poilchoi»

where ch(y,-) is child labels of y,-.

Finally, we infer the posterior probabilities P(y,-|y,, . . . ,yN) for each
term i using the Lauritzen algorithm as implemented in the SMILE li-
brary (Druzdzel, 1999; Lauritzen and Wermuth, 1989). These posterior
probabilities for each term (i.e. cell-type) are the estimated probabilities
that our method uses to annotate gene expression samples.

2.5 Method training and testing

Genomic experiments are known to suffer from potential laboratory and
dataset biases (Leek et al., 2010; Zilliox and Irizarry, 2007). Not control-
ling for this bias (during evaluation of any method applied to these data)
may result in an overestimation of performance and overﬁtting to
dataset-speciﬁc biases at the expense of the desired signals. Therefore,
for each cell-type, the series/datasets of the manually annotated samples
were partitioned into three sets with each set containing roughly the same
number of samples. Two partitions were used as the training set and the
other as the testing set. Never splitting a single series/dataset between
training and test sample sets ensures that our approach does not identify
signals speciﬁc to particular studies, but rather those reﬂective of cell-
types and tissues.

2.6 Cross-platform prediction

The individual classiﬁers in URSA were trained on samples only from the
most popular Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 platform
(hgu133plus2). URSA has not been explicitly modiﬁed or tuned for pre-
dicting across other platforms. As input to our method, a gene expression
proﬁle from other array-based and sequence-based platforms were quan-
tile transformed to generate a hgu133plus2-like expression proﬁle
(Section 2.6.1., later in the text). Additionally, a permutation test
(Section 2.6.2., later in the text) was performed to correct for potential
biases from gene coverage differences across platforms.

2.6.1 Quantile transformation The individual cell-type models in
URSA have been trained on one microarray platform (hgu133plus2).
To detect cell-type-speciﬁc information from other gene expression plat-
forms, we must first transform those expression values to a comparable
expression space. If we can effectively transform those values, our meth-
odiwithout any modiﬁcations or retrainingimay be able to measure
cell-type-speciﬁc signals in these cross-platform experiments. The individ-
ual expression values X,- may not be comparable across different platform
technologies (especially between array-based and sequence-based plat-
forms), but signals based on the relative abundance between genes
should be more or less preserved irrespective of the technology used.
Therefore, we quantile transform these cross-platform samples to pre-
served their relative gene abundances (or gene order) and compute

 

3038

ﬁle'spzumol‘pmﬂo'sopeuuopuorq/ﬁdnq

Ontology-aware tissue/cell-type classification

 

hgu133plus2-like expression values based on a hgu133plus2 reference dis-
tribution. This reference distribution was constructed by averaging the
expression value of each quantile across 1000 random hgu133plus2
arrays.

The most crucial bottleneck for cross-platform annotation is the bias
in gene coverage across platforms. The hgu95v2 microarray platform
(covering ~12 000 genes), for example, covers about two-thirds the
genes covered by hgu133plus2 (~18 000 genes). Classiﬁcation is handi-
capped by thousands of missing values, and hence, the mean expression
value of the reference distribution was used to impute missing gene values
(Troyanskaya et al., 2001).

2.6.2 Permutation test A simple permutation test was performed to
select signiﬁcant predictions. The input data xj consist of real and
imputed gene values. Introducing noise to the actual data will blur any
real signal and decrease its associated probability value. Thus, we per-
mute only the sample data 711(Xf), . . . , JTK(X/~) to generate a null distribu-
tion of SVM outputs 71(y,-)=(nk(y,),..., 71k (m), where nk(y,-)=w,-T-
nk(x,~). This null distribution is then used to call out questionable anno-
tations: any tissue annotation P(yilyl, . . . ,yN) with a value lower than
even a single random annotation P(y,-| 71kg? 1),. . . , my») is considered
insigniﬁcant and assigned a value of 0.

2.7 Double-blind evaluation of sample annotations

In addition to the evaluation based on our manual sample annotations
(Section 2.5., earlier in text), we conducted a rigorous double-blind lit-
erature-based study to evaluate the quality of URSA’s novel predictions.
To control for any subjective bias, we must also evaluate a random group
of predictions in the same literature-based study. First, 120 hgu133plus2
array experiments from GEO that were not in our manual annotation
were randomly selected. These experiments were partitioned into three
groups. URSA annotations were made for all samples, but only group 1
predictions were retained and group 2 samples were assigned predictions
from group 3. This procedure provides random annotations while ensur-
ing the same apparent behavior of predictions as true predicted annota-
tions. We use this conservative background to completely blind the
evaluator from distinguishing original from random annotations.

The quality of predicted annotations should be judged based on re-
trieval of both the most precise tissue term and more general terms con-
sistent with the precise term. For example, an acute lymphocytic leukemia
(ALL) sample predicted to ALL but also other non-blood related terms
such as urinary bladder and colon is precise but not consistent, whereas
the same sample predicted to blood cancer cell or leukocyte in addition to
ALL is both precise and consistent. Estimated annotations in group 1 (i.e.
original) and group 2 (i.e. random) were evaluated as precise and/or
consistent based on associated publications and textual sample descrip-
tions. We also repeated this double-blind study for other microarray
platforms: hgu133a, hgu95v2 and hugene1.05t.

3 RESULTS

We address the cell—type prediction challenge as a multilabel
classiﬁcation problem with hierarchical constraints to account
for the diverse nature of biological samples. We assess the
impact of incorporating the tissue ontology in our method and
the method’s robustness across different microarray preprocess—
ing methods. Although our method can be readily retrained to
any additional expression technologies given manually curated
samples, we ﬁnd that our method is capable of precisely annotat—
ing samples across platforms (including next—generation
sequencing—based assays) without any modiﬁcations to the ori—
ginal method or its parameters. We ﬁnally show that our

tissue/cell—type predictions are interpretable based on the biolo—
gical processes enriched among learned informative genes.

3.1 URSA uses the tissue ontology to accurately predict
tissue/cell—type signals

To address the challenge of limited gold standards and high noise
levels in the tissue/cell—type classiﬁcation problem, URSA incorp—
orates the ETC to better predict tissue/cell—type signals in a given
gene expression sample. BTO systematically deﬁnes parent—to—
child relationships between tissue and cell—type terms (Gremse
et al., 2011). URSA wields the complexity of this ontology to
both systematically label samples to train tissue/cell—type SVM
classiﬁers and also apply BNC to make consistent predictions.

To measure the impact of incorporating the ontology, we com—
pare URSA with individual (i.e. independent) one—versus—all
SVM classiﬁers whose outputs are converted to estimate prob—
ability values using logistic regression (Platt, 1999). For these
one—versus—all SVMs, whole blood samples are considered as
negatives in a leukocyte classiﬁer, for example. Both methods
were trained on ~9000 samples and tested on ~5000 independent
samples (Fig. 2a). The top—predicted term for each sample was
evaluated and automatically considered incorrect if the estimated
probability value was below a cutoff. Multiple cutoffs from 0 (i.e.
no cutoff) to 0.9 (i.e. high—conﬁdence cutoff) were tested
(Fig. 2a). This setup simulates the user experience with a prede—
ﬁned cutoff and penalizes correct top predictions with a low
probability value.

Across the entire range of probability cutoffs, URSA offers
accurate top predictions for more samples in the holdout set.
Without a cutoff on the estimated probabilities, both naive
SVM and ontology—aware URSA show considerable accuracy
of the top—predicted term over the heterogeneous evaluation set
(Fig. 2a, leftmost bar). However, URSA accurately predicts an
additional ~550 samples misclassiﬁed by the independent SVMs.
Furthermore, URSA conveniently computes a probability value
for each predicted tissue/cell—type annotation that provides a
natural intuition about the strength of the predicted tissue/cell—
type signal present in a given sample. Although probabilities can
also be obtained for the individual SVMs, URSA’s Bayesian
framework provides a uniﬁed probabilistic model that enforces
potential dependencies between distant and close tissues. This
abstraction consequently computes consistent parameter estima—
tions: e.g. if the probability for leukocyte is high, then the prob—
ability for blood should also be high, but not necessarily vice
versa. Lending import to the calibrated probability values calcu—
lated by BNC, the proportion of URSA’s accurate corrections of
SVM’s mis—annotations increases with higher probability cutoffs
(Fig. 2a). In case of high confidence predictions (0.9 cutoff),
URSA provides accurate annotations for ~94% of the test sam—
ples, 45% (>2200) of which were misclassiﬁed by the individual
SVMs. More detailed description is provided in the
Supplementary Information.

In addition to the overall performance evaluation, it is import—
ant to consider how annotation accuracy depends on the number
of expression proﬁles available for training for each tissue term
(namely ‘term size’). Term size also serves as an appropriate es—
timation of the term’s speciﬁcity in the tissue ontology, as sample
annotations were propagated based on the same ontology.

Ontology-aware tissue/cell-type classification

 

samples to their tissue and cell—type of origin. In this article, we
present a scalable computational method URSA that predicts
tissue/cell—type signals in expression proﬁles across platforms
and technologies. Key to its performance is the incorporation
of the tissue ontology. Much of URSA’s improved performance
can be attributed to the construction of more than one hundred
additional intermediate (i.e. non—leaf) classiﬁers, which are then
integrated using a Bayesian framework.

URSA can be used to automatically annotate samples in
public gene expression repositories where most samples are cur—
rently lacking tissue/cell—type—speciﬁc information. Researchers
can discover speciﬁc signals in their own samples via our inter—
active interface at ursa.princeton.edu. Others interested in inte—
grative studies can download the URSA C++ software and
annotate samples on a large scale.

Despite URSA’s current applicability to a wide variety of tis—
sues/cell—types, its predictions can be further improved as the
ontology used for integration adds additional terms and associ—
ations. For example, immunologists may be interested in the
signal of speciﬁc T—lymphocytes such as CD4+ T cells, Th17
cells, germinal B cells, and so forth. Unfortunately, the current
BRENDA ontology (which was used as a controlled vocabulary
and the ontology structure of our method) does not include such
terms. Nonetheless, URSA’s ability to delineate tissue/cell—type
signals without known biomarker genes makes it naturally ex—
tendable to such speciﬁc cell—types as the BRENDA ontology is
extended with more terms and associations (Gremse et al., 2011).
We plan to regularly maintain and update the software with new
tissue and cell—type annotations and the latest version of the
BRENDA ontology.

Both the strength and the limitation of our method across
platforms and technologies depend on the amount of tissue
signal in the gene order and the number of missing values. For
a given gene expression proﬁle from a different platform, quan—
tile transformation is applied to compute hg133plus2—like expres—
sion values. In consequence, our method is robust to different
normalization techniques used because only the information of
relative gene abundance is transferred. However, speciﬁc signals
associated with the particular gene expression value may be lost,
and properly incorporating such signals may provide greater pre—
diction accuracy. Furthermore, expression values for genes not
measured in hg133plus2 could affect the accuracy of our method,
although simple mean imputation seems to alleviate that effect.

URSA’s tissue and cell—type—speciﬁc models provide a biolo—
gical interpretation of its predictions. As such, URSA could po—
tentially be used to test and identify possible sample
contaminations, resolve cancer samples of unknown primary ori—
gin and perhaps provide insight into the molecular basis of
poorly characterized clinical subtypes.

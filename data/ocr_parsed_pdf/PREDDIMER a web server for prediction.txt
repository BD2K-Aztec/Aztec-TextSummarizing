ABSTRACT

Summary: Here we present PREDDIMER, a web tool for prediction of
dimer structure of transmembrane (TM) helices. PREDDIMER allows (i)
reconstruction of a number of dimer structures for given sequence(s)
of TM protein fragments, (ii) ranking and filtering of predicted struc-
tures according to respective values of a scoring function, (iii) visual-
ization of predicted 3D dimer structures and (iv) visualization of surface
hydrophobicity of TM helices and their contacting (interface) regions
represented as 2D maps.

Results: We implemented online the original PREDDIMER algorithm
and benchmarked the server on 11 TM sequences, whose 3D dimer
conformations were obtained previously by nuclear magnetic reson-
ance spectroscopy. In the most of tested cases backbone root-
mean-square deviations of closest predicted conformations from the
experimental reference are below 3A. A randomization test displays
good anticorrelation (—0.82) between values of the scoring function and
statistical significance of the prediction ‘by chance’. Going beyond a
single dimer conformation, our web tool predicts an ensemble of pos-
sible conformations, which may be useful for explanation of a function-
ing of bitopic membrane proteins, e.g. receptor tyrosine kinases.
Availability and implementation: PREDDIMER can be accessed for

1 INTRODUCTION

Transmembrane (TM) domains of bitopic proteins comprise just
a single helix. For particular class of such proteins with high
biological importanceireceptor tyrosine kinases (RTKsFit
has been shown that TM fragments play a crucial role in dimer-
ization and activation of these receptors by controlling orienta-
tion of their intracellular kinase domains (Cymer and Schneider,
2010). The knowledge of spatial structures of dimers of TM frag-
ments of bitopic proteins is important for understanding the
functioning of these molecules upon their oligomerization in
the cell membrane. Being reasonable alternative to experimental

techniques of TM dimer structures determination (Bocharov
et al., 2010), the existing modeling approaches vary a lot in
their complexity, prediction power and computational efﬁciency:
starting from simple sequence motif-based algorithms to labori-
ous force-ﬁeld techniques like Monte Carlo conformational
search in implicit membranes, coarse-grained or atomic molecu-
lar dynamics simulations in lipid bilayers or different combin-
ations of them (Polyansky et al., 2011). Here, we present
PREDDIMER web server for prediction of ensembles of
possible spatial structures of TM helical dimers based just on
respective TM sequence(s). Our web server uses original
PREDDIMER algorithm described elsewhere (Polyansky
et al., 2012). To our knowledge up-to-date, this is the only online
tool, which allows fast and efﬁcient prediction of TM dimers
structure as well as Visualization of predicted results both in
3D and 2D (2D maps of surface hydrophobicity of interacting
helices with outlined contacting interfaces). Although the server
does not address a question whether two given TM fragments
dimerize or not, which is still far from being fully reachable for
solely in silico techniques, it provides their putative dimer con-
formations along with estimation of their reliability.

2 WORKFLOW AND IMPLEMENTATION

The PREDDIMER server has two modes: (i) prediction of TM-dimer
structures from sequences and (ii) analysis of hydrophobic properties and
contacting regions for an existing dimer structure (separate Protein Data
Bank (PDB) ﬁles for each of interacting helices have to be uploaded by
user). In the ﬁrst case, user should input one or two TM sequences (single
for homo- and two for heterodimers, respectively) with a length 2(F35
amino acid residues, optionally specify their name(s) and indicate orienta-
tion of helices in a dimer (parallel/antiparallel) and pH, which determines
ionization state of amino acid sidechains. On submitting a prediction task,
the server sends an e-mail notiﬁcation with unique link to a result page,
which will be created on calculations completion. On average, the predic-
tion takes ~20 min depending on the server workload. The server is im-
plemented using Python and PHP programming languages, and also Zend
and Bootstrap frameworks. The algorithm details are available in online
manual (http://model.nmr.ru/preddimer/manual). Parameters of predicted
dimer conformations such as rank of a structure, F 5CD R value, helixihelix
crossing angle (x) and rotation angles around helical axes (a1, 072) are
presented in an interactive table, where selection of a certain row results
in output of respective 2D maps for both helices and interactive 3D 00n-
formation of the dimer. Predicted PDB structures, 2D maps (PNG and
PDF) and resulting table (text format) are available for download as

3 PERFORMANCE

We calculated possible conformations for 10 homodimers and 1
heterodimer, whose structures were obtained previously by
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. 1A).
In most cases, NMR-like conformations are among three top-
scoring models for a given dimer (total number of models is
shown in parentheses) and display backbone root-mean—square
deviations (RMSD) from the references below 3A. The only
exceptions are ErbB3 homodimer, whose published structure dis-
plays anomalous packing compared with other RTKs (Li et al.,
2012), and FGFR3, whose NMR structure is characterized by
the presence of distorted conformations of TM helices (V olynsky
et al., 2013). For the most well-known TM dimer structure of
glycophorin A (GpA, PDB: 1AFO), the server gives a top-
ranked model with RMSD of 1.56A from the reference. We
performed also randomization test, where probability to form
a dimer between a given TM fragment and random ones were
estimated over 1000 shufﬂes of interacting sequence. P—Values
obtained for the studied dimer models display good anticorrel-
ation (—0.82) with the respective F SCO R values (Supplementary
Figure S1), suggesting the scoring function as reasonable and fast
estimate of the reliability of predicted conformations.

Dimerization interfaces are outlined. Axis values correspond to the rotation
angle around the helical axis (or) and the distance along the latter (Z),
respectively. 2D maps are colored according to MHP arbitrary units

Because the algorithm operates with ideal helices, it outputs
rather ‘coarse-grained’ initial dimer conﬁgurations, whereas the
membrane environment is not accounted explicitly. At the same
time, the predicted conformations represent a reliable starting
point for further molecular dynamics optimization in explicit
membranes, which usually increases their similarity to the experi-
mental structures (Polyansky et al., 2012). Noteworthy, the
algorithm predicts a number of possible dimer conﬁgurations,
which is not a case of NMR techniques usually giving a set of
similar models optimally suited for the particular membrane
mimic (micelles, bicelles). The calculated dimer conformations
can correspond to different intermediate states of TM domains,
thus shedding light on the mechanism of protein functioning. We
illustrate this on the example of RTK ErbB2 (Fig. 1B and C).
The first predicted right-handed model (Fig. 1B, left) corres-
ponds well to the experimental structure (2JWA, RMSD of
1.43A), whereas the second one (Fig. 1B, right) is similar to
alternative left-handed state suggested by modeling for this
dimer (Fleishman et al., 2002). Switching between possible inter-
action interfaces (Fig. 1C) results in different helices orientation
with respect to intracellular kinase domains and may contribute
to activation of ErbB2 (Fleishman et al., 2002) and other RTKs
(Endres et al., 2013; Volynsky et al., 2013). In this context,
PREDDIMER web tool goes beyond common concept of just
a single structure of TM helical dimer usually available experi-
mentally in speciﬁc conditions of NMR setup.

Orione

 

Preprocessing, quality control and trimming. The funda—
mental step before any NGS analysis is the quality control of
reads and their trimming. To cope with long reads and paired—
end technology, FastX (http://goo.gl/quyV) and FASTQC
(http://goo.gl/6TUqD) were complemented with speciﬁcally de—
veloped tools (see also workflow #1 in the Supplementary
information).

Reads mapping. Mapping is a key step in many NGS applica—
tions from bacteria resequencing to variant calling. The most
widely used aligners are integrated in Orione, including BWA
(Li and Durbin, 2009), Bowtiel (Langmead et al., 2009),
Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), SOAP (Li et al.,
2008) and MOSAIK (http://git.io/QrYWXg). We further
added BLAT (Kent, 2002), SHRiMP (David et al., 2011),
LASTZ (Harris, 2007) and BFAST (Homer et al., 2009) for
use with long reads from 454 Roche.

De novo assembly. De novo assembly produces contigs without
the aid of a reference genome. Different methods, either based on
a de Bruijn graph [Velvet (Zerbino and Birney, 2008), ABySS
(Simpson et al., 2009) and SPAdes (Bankevich et al., 2012)] or on
a greedy approach [SSAKE, Edena (Hernandez et al., 2008)], are
available in Orione.

Scaffolding. After mapping, contigs are ordered and oriented
to produce even longer sequences called scaffolds, exploiting the
mate—pair/paired—end information. Orione includes the most es—
tablished scaffolders such as SSAKE, SSPACE, SEQuel and
SOPRA.

Post assembly, contigs statistics, (multi) aligning and variant
calling. This section of Orione includes tools we have developed
covering task such as genome—scale alignment, high—quality con—
tigs extraction, statistics over contigs or draft genomes (N50/
NG50 values, contigs length distribution, high/low quality
regions/gaps in draft genomes).

Annotation. Annotation is the process of identifying meaning—
ful biological information from sequences. Glimmer and
tRNAscan—SE (Lowe and Eddy, 1997) were wrapped into
Orione together with the Prokka pipeline, enabling easy
Genbank/DDJB/ENA submission.

RNA-Seq. We integrated EDGE—pro tool for bacterial RNA—
Seq analysis. As EDGE—pro requires genome annotation files, we
developed an accessory tool (‘Get EDGE—pro files’) that retrieves
them directly from the NCBI RefSeq repository.

Metagenomics and other tools. We added to the standard
Galaxy metagenomics pipeline MetaPh1An (Segata et al., 2012)
and MetaVelvet (Namiki et al., 2012). The MetaGeneMark (Zhu
et al., 2010) annotation tool has been added for gene prediction
in metagenomic sequences and a workflow has been developed
for (bacterial) metatranscriptome analysis. We complete this sec—
tion with instruments for data filtering, conversion and tax—
onomy abundance displaying into the Krona visualizer (Ondov
et al., 2011).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Pairwise protein sequence alignments are generally
evaluated using scores defined as the sum of substitution scores
for aligning amino acids to one another, and gap scores for aligning
runs of amino acids in one sequence to null characters inserted
into the other. Protein profiles may be abstracted from multiple
alignments of protein sequences, and substitution and gap scores
have been generalized to the alignment of such profiles either to
single sequences or to other profiles. Although there is widespread
agreement on the general form substitution scores should take for
profile-sequence alignment, little consensus has been reached on
how best to construct profile—profile substitution scores, and a large
number of these scoring systems have been proposed. Here, we
assess a variety of such substitution scores. For this evaluation,
given a gold standard set of multiple alignments, we calculate
the probability that a profile column yields a higher substitution
score when aligned to a related than to an unrelated column.
We also generalize this measure to sets of two or three adjacent
columns. This simple approach has the advantages that it does not
depend primarily upon the gold-standard alignment columns with the
weakest empirical support, and that it does not need to fit gap and
offset costs for use with each substitution score studied.

Results: A simple symmetrization of mean profile-sequence scores
usually performed the best. These were followed closely by several
specific scoring systems constructed using a variety of rationales.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein sequence comparison is fundamental to computational
molecular biology. Early work in this ﬁeld focussed on pairwise
sequence alignment, and was then inevitably extended to multiple
alignment. Approaches to multiple alignment that generalize
dynamic programming to more than two dimensions (Altschul and
Lipman, 1989; Carrillo and Lipman, 1988; Lipman et (11., 1989;
Murata et (11., 1985; Sankoff, 1975; Sankoff and Cedergren, 1983)
are necessarily conﬁned to a small number of sequences, and
have therefore found limited applications. Most multiple alignment

algorithms proceed, in either a progressive or iterative manner, by
performing pairwise alignments either between single sequences and
multiple alignments or between two multiple alignments (Bacon and
Anderson, 1986; Berger and Munson, 1991; Edgar, 2004a; Feng
and Doolittle, 1987; Notredame et (11., 2000; Papadopoulos and
Agarwala, 2007; Taylor, 1987; Thompson et (11., 1994a). Closely
related subﬁelds concern the extraction of protein ‘proﬁles’, or
position-speciﬁc score matrices, from multiple alignments and
their comparison either to single sequences (Altschul et (11., 1997;
Gribskov et (11., 1987; Patthy, 1987; Taylor, 1986) or to one
another (Altschul et (11., 2010; Edgar, 2004b; Edgar and Sjolander,
2003, 2004; Heger and Holm, 2001, 2003; Marti-Renom et (11.,
2004; Mittelman et (11., 2003; Ohlson et (11., 2004; von Ohsen and
Zimmer, 2001; Panchenko, 2003; Pietrokovski, 1996; Rychlewski
et (11., 2000; Sadreyev and Grishin, 2003; Soding, 2005; Tomii and
Akiyama, 2004; Wang and Dunbrack, 2004; Yona and Levitt, 2002).

Central to any protein alignment method is the scoring system;
it uses to distinguish among the exponentially large number
of alternative alignments. For pairwise sequence comparison,
alignment scores are usually constructed as the sum of ‘substitution
scores’ for aligning pairs of letters, and ‘gap scores’ for aligning
runs of letters in one sequence to null characters inserted into
the other. In the context of ungapped local alignment, an analytic
statistical theory (Altschul, 1991; Dembo et (11., 1994; Karlin and
Altschul, 1990) characterizes all substitution scores as log-odds
scores, and most popular pairwise substitution scores have been
explicitly constructed using the log-odds formalism (Dayhoff et (11.,
1978; Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992; Schwartz and Dayhoff, 1978).
Similarly, most extensions of substitution scores to proﬁle-sequence
comparison now involve log-odds scores as well, mediated by
position-speciﬁc amino acid frequencies estimated from a multiple
alignment column (Altschul et (11., 1997; Brown et (11., 1993;
Sjolander et (11., 1996; Tatusov et (11., 1994). However, for proﬁle—
proﬁle comparison, there is no consensus on how the alignment of
positions or columns from two proﬁles should be scored, and a large
variety of such substitution scores have been proposed.

There have been a variety of comparative evaluations of proﬁle—
proﬁle scoring systems (Edgar, 2004b; Edgar and Sjolander, 2004;
Marti-Renom et (11., 2004; Mittelman et (11., 2003; Ohlson et (11.,
2004; Panchenko, 2003; Pietrokovski, 1996; Wang and Dunbrack,
2004), some quite systematic and comprehensive. Most of these
studies have assessed scoring systems by how well they were able
to distinguish by score alignments of related and unrelated proﬁles,
or by how accurately they were able to align related proﬁles. Several
studies (Edgar and Sjolander, 2004; Marti-Renom et (11., 2004;

Profile—profile substitution scores

 

Ohlson et (11., 2004; Wang and Dunbrack, 2004) faced the issue of
how to choose proﬁle—proﬁle gap scores to use in conjunction with
the various substitution scores considered. In addition, they had to
‘offset’ raw substitution scores so they could be used with equal
footing in a local alignment algorithm. They addressed this problem
by attempting to optimize, for each scoring system, gap and offset
score parameters over a multidimensional space.

Here, we take up again the question of comparing proﬁle—proﬁle
substitution scores, but propose a new evaluation methodology that
avoids the question of how best to select gap and offset parameters.
In brief, given a ‘gold standard’ multiple alignment, we ﬁrst choose
two subsets of sequences from the alignment, and construct a proﬁle
from each aligned set. We then simply calculate the probability
that a column from one of the proﬁles has a higher substitution
score when aligned to the correct column of the other proﬁle than
when aligned to an incorrect column. We generalize this measure
by considering two or three adjacent columns from one proﬁle
aligned to adjacent columns of the other. We argue below that these
measures of scoring system quality are appropriate, and have several
advantages to previous measures. Our approach is related to one
suggested by Edgar (2004b), but differs in several ways, e.g. in that
it does not compare column—column scores from different proﬁle
pairs.

As described below, our approach requires a set of accurate
multiple alignments involving fairly large numbers of distantly
related proteins. Several multiple alignments sets have been
developed for evaluating multiple alignment methodologies, but not
all are well suited to our approach, often because their alignments
involve too few sequences, or sequences that are on average
too closely related. Accordingly, we based our evaluation set of
multiple alignments upon a standard database, but supplemented
it with carefully curated multiple alignments from several recent
publications.

We applied our measures of alignment quality to 39 proﬁle—
proﬁle substitution scoring systems, most of which have previously
been proposed in the literature. Although no single scoring system
emerged as best in all our tests, variations on the approach of
constructing scores as an average of proﬁle-sequence scores (Heger
and Holm, 2003; Mittelman et (11 ., 2003; Panchenko, 2003; Sadreyev
and Grishin, 2003) consistently outperformed most others. Fairly
close behind were ‘BILD scores’, constructed as a generalization
to multiple alignments of pairwise log-odds scores (Altschul et (11.,
2010), a weighted and symmetrized form of relative entropy-based
scores (Yona and Levitt, 2002) and ‘co-emission’-based scores
(Soding, 2005). Incorporating any of these substitution scores into
a proﬁle—proﬁle or a multiple alignment program will generally
require the introduction of gap scores and perhaps of offset scores.
Our evaluation method purposely avoids the consideration of such
scores, and the best way to deﬁne them may depend upon the
substitution scores with which they will be used.

2 METHODS
2.1 Gold standard alignment set

In order to evaluate proﬁleiproﬁle scoring systems, we require a set of
accurate multiple alignments to serve as a ‘gold standard’. A variety of
multiple alignment datasets have been developed for the explicit purpose
of evaluating multiple alignment methods. Recently, Edgar (2010) analyzed
several such sets (Edgar, 2004a; Raghava 61611., 2003; Thompson 21111., 1999;

van Walle at (11., 2004), and found them ﬂawed by a variety of measures.
Nevertheless, we require some alignments as a basis for analysis, and so
began with OXBench (Raghava at (11., 2003), the dataset that appeared most
reliable by Edgar’s measures.

Our approach requires relatively large alignments, ideally containing over
25 sequences, of distantly related sequences. Only 11 OXBench alignments
were suitable, so we supplemented these with 14 additional, carefully
constructed multiple alignments from recently published papers (Zhang and
AraVind, 2010; Zhang 21111., 2011). The resulting alignment set is summarized
in Supplementary Table Sl; it has 25 alignments from 8 superfamilies, each
alignment containing from 27 to 122 sequences. As described below, these
large multiple alignments may be used to generate many distinct pairs of
proﬁles, already in putatively proper alignment.

Proﬁleiproﬁle alignment methods generally are used to compare proﬁles
that are constructed from multiple alignments whose constituent sequences
are more closely related within an alignment than between them. To construct
pairs of proﬁles with this property, we proceed as follows. From a given gold
standard multiple alignment, we choose at random a pair of sequences S1
and S2 to act as seeds for two proﬁles. We then choose at random a new
sequence from the multiple alignment, determine with which of S1 and S2
(to both of which it is already aligned) it shares greater percent identity, and
add it to the proﬁle seeded by that sequence. We repeat this process until the
two proﬁles have in aggregate N sequences, with N equal to 10 or 20. If one
of the proﬁles so constructed has <3 sequences, we start over. Finally, the
pair of proﬁles is assigned to a bin, depending on the mean percent identity
between all sequences from one proﬁle and all those from the other. Our
bins cover the percent identity ranges 5710, 10715, 15720. 20725. 25730
and 3&35; any pair of proﬁles that falls into none of these bins is discarded.

Given the size of our original alignments, we are able to generate a
very large number of effectively distinct pairs of aligned proﬁles. We
therefore populate our bins evenly, and with equal representation from
each superfamily and, subordinately, from each constituent family. The only
hindrance is that certain of our alignments lend themselves to generating
proﬁle pairs only for a subrange of percent identities, as detailed in
Supplementary Table S 1. When populating bins outside their effective range,
these alignments are ignored.

2.2 Quality measures for proﬁle—proﬁle substitution
scores

Our measures of substitution score quality are calculated on pairs of proﬁles
that are putatively accurately aligned. For a given column of one proﬁle, we
calculate the percent probability 711 that its substitution score, when aligned
to the correct column of the other proﬁle, is greater than when aligned to
an incorrect column; ties register as half a success. Averaging In over all
columns of both proﬁles yields our quality measure H 1. For proﬁleiproﬁle
as for sequenceisequence alignment, perhaps the simplest error involves the
misalignment of a single column, which leads to the slight misplacement of
a gap, as illustrated in Figure 1. The measure H 1 can be seen to bear directly
on the probability of such a simple alignment error arising.

Slightly larger errors in gap placement can correspond to the misalignment
of two or more adjacent columns. An error of this sort, however, cannot
always be explained as multiple single-column misalignment errors, and
may require the scores of the misaligned columns to be considered together.
Accordingly, we can extend the measure I'll to 11,, by determining, for two
related proﬁles, the mean percent probability that the aggregate score of
n adjacent columns from one proﬁle is greater when properly than when
improperly aligned to n adjacent columns from the other. In this article, we
will consider only the measures H 1, 112 and 113.

Measuring substitution score quality in this way avoids using the
scores actually to construct by dynamic programming new proﬁle7
proﬁle alignments, and may therefore be considered somewhat indirect.
Nevertheless, our approach has several distinct advantages. The location of
gaps in an accurate alignment of two proﬁles effectively limits realignment-
based measures to evaluating scores on a very small number of column

pairs. In contrast, our measures treat all proﬁle positions equivalently, and
gather information from them all. Furthermore, it has recently been argued
that none of the collections of multiple alignments used as gold standards
for evaluating multiple alignment programs, or sometimes for evaluating
proﬁleiproﬁle scoring systems, is very reliable (Edgar, 2010). A problem
with constructing a new alignment B from sequences contained in a gold
standard alignment A, and then comparing B to A, is that the two alignments
are most likely to differ precisely in the columns of A that are least reliably
aligned, whereas no information is gained from the majority of A’s columns
that are relatively easy to align, and therefore most likely to be accurate.

An additional problem with realignment-based measures for evaluating
substitution scores is that they generally require gap and offset scores to
be speciﬁed for each scoring system. This entails optimizing at least three
independent parameters (Edgar and Sjolander, 2004; Marti-Renom et (11.,
2004; Ohlson et (11., 2004; Wang and Dunbrack, 2004), which is time
consuming and, because inevitably non-optimal, introduces noise into the
analysis. More importantly, as discussed below, the best form for gap scores
to take varies with the substitution scores employed (Altschul, 1989), so
choosing a particular form for gap scores is likely to bias one’s conclusions.
This article proceeds on the assumption that it is reasonable to analyze
substitution scores independently of gap and offset scores. Once a particular
set of substitution scores has been selected, gap and offset scores may then
be optimized in the chosen context.

2.3 General issues for proﬁle—proﬁle scoring systems

2.3.] Sequence weights and1 independent observations Proﬁleiproﬁle
substitution scores depend at root upon the counts of amino acids observed
in the two multiple alignment columns implicitly being aligned. However,
the sequences comprising a multiple alignment generally cannot be Viewed
as independent observations from a protein family, but may have a
complex structure of correlations arising from phylogenetic relationships.
Accordingly, it is often advisable to downweight the amino acid counts
derived from closely related and thus highly correlated sequences, and a
large number of methods for doing this have been proposed (Altschul et (11.,
1989; Bailey and Gribskov, 1996; Eddy et (11., 1995; Gerstein et (11., 1994;
Gotoh, 1995; Henikoff and Henikoff, 1994; Krogh and Mitchison, 1995;
Sander and Schneider, 1991; Sibbald and Argos, 1990; SunyaeV et (11.,
1999; Thompson et (11., 1994b; Vingron and Sibbald, 1993). Relatedly, it
is also sometimes useful to estimate the number of effectively independent
observations a column represents (Altschul et (11., 1997, 2009; Brown et (11.,
1997; SunyaeV et (11., 1999; Wang and Dunbrack, 2004), which is generally
smaller than the actual number of residues it aligns. Using these methods,
the data in a proﬁle column can be summarized by an ‘effective’ amino
acid frequency vector]? (perhaps extended to include the null character as a
twenty-ﬁrst letter), and an ‘effective’ number of observations 0. One may, of
course, forgo any weighting methods in generating these column statistics. In
either case, it will sometimes be useful to refer to the ‘observed’ amino acid
count vector 2:0}. In this article, when sequence weighting is performed,
we used the method of SunyaeV et a1. (1999) with a modiﬁcation described
in Altschul et a1. (2009) for estimating the effective number of independent
observations.

2.3.2 Predicted frequencies Before comparing a column, summarized by
c andf, to another, it may be useful to estimate the unobserved amino acid
frequencies 21‘ thought to characterize the column. When 0 is large 21‘ should
approach}, but when 0 is small this will generally be a poor approximation:
it is clearly wrong to infer zero probability for an amino acid to appear
in an alignment position just because it is not observed in a small sample.
Two methods for inferring 21‘ from c and]? have gained widespread use.
The ‘Dirichlet mixture method’ (Brown et (11., 1993; Sjolander et (11., 1996)
is rigorously Bayesian. It assumes a Dirichlet mixture prior on the space
of amino acid frequency vectors, and obtains 21‘ by integration over the
posterior distribution implied by the data from a column. The alternative
‘data-dependent pseudocount method’ (Altschul et (11., 1997; Tatusov et (11.,
1994) calculates 21‘ by adding ‘pseudocounts’ to the observed amino counts Z;
these pseudocounts are derived from Z and a speciﬁed pairwise amino acid
substitution matrix. One motivation for this method is the desire for the target
frequencies 21‘ to approach those implicit in the speciﬁed matrix (Altschul,
1991; Karlin and Altschul, 1990) as c approaches 1. Both methods imply
that 21‘ approaches]? as c grows large.

Many of the proﬁleiproﬁle substitution scores we will consider are
deﬁned using predicted frequencies 21‘ for the proﬁle columns aligned. In
order not to confound an analysis of the quality of substitution scores with
the method used for deriving 21‘ from Z, we employ the Dirichlet mixture
method throughout. This choice is preferred because the Dirichlet mixture
method is integral to the BILD-based scores (Altschul et (11., 2010) that
we will consider. We use the ‘recode3’ Dirichlet mixture priors developed
at the University of California at Santa Cruz (Supplementary Table S2a;
http://compbio.soe.ucsc.edu/dirichlets/index.html), but make no claim that
these are superior to other possible priors.

2.3.3 Gap scores Proﬁleiproﬁle alignment scoring systems in general
must deal with two distinct issues arising from gaps. The ﬁrst is that
a proﬁle column itself may be constructed from a multiple alignment
that contains gaps in the corresponding position. Should the frequency of
gaps in this position be estimated explicitly? If so, how should such gap
frequencies be considered when deﬁning substitution scores for aligning two
proﬁle columns? As will be evident, some of the proﬁleiproﬁle substitution
scores considered below have natural (although not necessarily optimal)
generalizations to deal with gap frequencies, while others do not. The second
issue is that the alignment of two proﬁles may introduce gaps, aligning
columns of one proﬁle with gap columns inserted into the other. How such
gaps should be scored will depend upon the proﬁleiproﬁle substitution scores
adopted, and also upon the way in which gap frequencies are treated by such
substitution scores.

Because the gap-scoring problems for proﬁleiproﬁle alignment are
multifarious and likely not subject to a uniform optimal treatment (Altschul,
1989), we here attempt to sidestep the issues involved as much as possible.
We ignore gaps within a column for all proﬁleiproﬁle substitution scores.
To minimize the effect upon our results, we conﬁne our analysis primarily to
proﬁle columns derived from alignment positions containing relatively few
gaps. Also, our quality measures for substitution scores avoid any need to
specify gap scores for proﬁleiproﬁle alignment.

2.4 Proﬁle—proﬁle substitution scores

The substitution scoring systems we consider largely subsume those
analyzed by Edgar and Sjolander (2004); Edgar (2004b); Marti-Renom
et a1. (2004); Mittelman et a1. (2003); Ohlson et a1. (2004); Pietrokovski
(1996); Panchenko (2003); Wang and Dunbrack (2004). We do not, however,
consider scores that are rounding variants of others, or that are asymmetric
under exchange of the aligned columns, but we do analyze several scores
considered in none of these papers.

Many substitution scores make use either of the observed frequencies]?
associated with the columns compared, or the predicted frequencies  In
addition, some substitution scores use the odds ratio vectors g or 7, deﬁned
by g, =ﬁ/pi and r, =qi/pi, where [—5 is the vector of background amino acid

Profile—profile substitution scores

 

frequencies. Yet others use the log-odds score vector 3 deﬁned by s, =log ri;
a corresponding score vector cannot be derived from  because some of [9’s
components may be zero.

Certain proﬁleiproﬁle scores are deﬁned using a standard pairwise
substitution score matrix. Such a matrix S has implicit amino acid pair target
frequencies Q (Altschul, 1991; Karlin and Altschul, 1990), which may also
be expressed as amino acid pair odds ratios R. In short, RiJzQiJ/(pipj)
and SM 2 %lnRiJ-, where A is a scale factor. In this study, we will use the
BLOSUM-62 matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992), and its associated target
frequencies and odds ratios, whenever such a matrix is called for.

We use the convention that larger substitution scores are better. However,
some scoring systems are based on distances, with smaller distances
preferred, so for these the substitution score needs to be the negative distance.
In practice, an offset is usually added for constructing local alignments, but
because we do not use the scores here for this purpose, we have no need for
such offsets.

We summarize below the 39 substitution scores we consider. Where these
substitution scores have been analyzed by one of Edgar and Sjolander (2004);
Edgar (2004b); Mittelman et a1. (2003); Marti-Renom et a1. (2004); Ohlson
et a1. (2004); Pietrokovski (1996); Panchenko (2003); Wang and Dunbrack
(2004), Supplementary Table S3 lists the corresponding names those papers
employ. Also, if a score was not introduced in one of these articles, the table
cites the paper where it was ﬁrst proposed, as best as we have been able to
determine.

2.4.1 Euclidean-distance based scores Intuitively, one prefers to align
columns with similar letter frequencies, so one may base a scoring system
on a ‘distance’ between two colunm-derived vectors. An obvious candidate
is the Euclidean distance between vectors 35 and 35’:

D(35,35’)E IZ(X,—x;)2. (1)

For aligning two proﬁle columns, the vector 35 used in Equation (1) may
be taken, variously, to be the   7 or 3 derived from the ﬁrst column,
and 35’ the corresponding vector from the second. We call the ﬁve resulting
scores, deﬁned as the negative of Equation (1), Euclid-f, Euclid-g, Euclid-q,
Euclid-r and Euclid-s.

2.4.2 Dot-product based scores The dot product of two vectors 35 and 35’
is deﬁned as
35.35’ 5 2m; . (2)
i

Because the dot product of two vectors of ﬁxed magnitude increases as
the angle between the vectors decreases, it has been seen as a promising
basis for proﬁleiproﬁle substitution scores. Basing 35 and 35’ in Equation (2)
on the various proﬁle-column vectors we have deﬁned yields the ﬁve scores
dot-f, dot-g, dot-q, dot-r and dot-s. In addition, when 35 and 35’ are odds
ratios, it has been suggested that a substitution score is better deﬁned as
the log of the dot product (Madera et a1., 2004), yielding in our notation
the two additional scores [dot-g and [dot-r. Although such a monotonic
transformation is invisible to our IT 1 measure of score quality, it can make
a difference when the scores for aligned column pairs are added. Finally,
Soding (2005) has proposed a proﬁleiproﬁle scoring system that, in essence,
is the log of (107’ or (1’07; we call this score [dot-qr.

2.4.3 Pearson-correlation based scores The Pearson correlation of two
vectors 35 and 35’ is deﬁned as

a 4, 2,1161 -3€)(X,’ 46’)

14wa )E .
‘1 21119 ‘392 ZiW’ ‘3’)2

where 35 and 35’ are, respectively, the means of the components of 35 and
35’. Basing 35 and 35’ on our various proﬁle-column vectors yields the ﬁve
scores corr-f, corr-g, corr-q, corr-r and corr-s. It has also been suggested
(Pietrokovski, 1996) that one replace the components of the vectors 35 and 35’

(3)

by their numerical ranks within these vectors (i.e. replacing the largest x, by
1, etc.) to yield )7 and y", and then calculate the Pearson correlation of these
new vectors. Doing so yields the four scores we call rank-f, rank-g, rank-q
and rank-r; because logarithms are monotonic, rank-s is identical to rank-r.

2.4.4 Pairwise-substituti0n-matrix based scores Given a pairwise sub-
stitution score matrix S and two probability vectors 35 and 35’ , one can calculate
the average score:
1465,3535 ZX,’X}S1J. 
Ia]

Depending upon whether the observed or predicted frequencies are used
for 35 and 35’ , we call the two resulting scores aS-f and aS-q. The former is
closely related to what are frequently called ‘SP’ or ‘Sum-of—Pairs’ scores for
multiple alignments (Bacon and Anderson, 1986). A variation on this idea
averages the target frequencies Q or odds ratios R implied by S and then
takes the logarithm of this average (von Ohsen and Zimmer, 2001). We call
the resulting scores laQ-f, laQ-q, laR-f and laR-q.

2.4.5 Relative-entropy based scores The relative entropy (Cover and
Thomas, 1991) of two probability vectors 35 and 35’ is deﬁned as

H(35;35’)Einlog(xi/xl’). (5)

By continuity, H may be extended to the case where some 35, are zero by
simply omitting the corresponding terms. However, if any 351’ vanishes while
35, remains positive, H is undeﬁned. Although H is asymmetric, it may be
symmetrized (Lin, 1991) using the deﬁnition

H"(35,35’)EH(35;35’)+H(35’;35). (6)

With predicted frequencies (1‘ and (1" substituted for 35 and 35’ , the negative
of this expression yields a score we call sre-q (Sjolander, 1998). In general,
no corresponding score using observed frequencies is valid, because one H
term or both may be undeﬁned.

An alternative symmetrization of relative entropy is the JenseniShannon
divergence (Lin, 1991), deﬁned as

1(1)?) E % [H(i;i”)+H(i’;i”)]. (7)

where 35” = (35 +35’ ) / 2. The negative of this expression may be used with either
observed or predicted frequencies to yield the two scores we call JS-f and
JS-q, respectively. Yona and Levitt (2002) argued that columns with amino
acid frequencies far from the background frequencies [—5 should have greater
weight than those with frequencies near  and therefore deﬁned a score

—~ —~i 1 —~ —~i —~ii —~
Y(x,x)E§[1—J(x,x)][1+1(x ,p)]. (8)

Depending upon whether observed of predicted frequencies are used for
35 and 35’ , we call the resulting scores YL-f and YL-q.

2.4.6 Proﬁle-sequence based scores Over the years a number of methods
have been proposed for generating proﬁle-sequence substitution scores, but a
consensus has formed on the best general strategy. From a multiple alignment
column with observed counts Z, one estimates amino acid frequencies  from
which odds ratios 7 and log-odds scores 3 are derived. The score for aligning
the proﬁle column to a particular amino acid then reduces to selecting the
appropriate component of 3. If instead one wishes to align the proﬁle column
to that from another proﬁle, one possible generalization is to use the observed
frequencies? from the second proﬁle column to calculate a weighted average
35’ .3 of proﬁle-sequence scores (Heger and Holm, 2001).

An immediate conceptual difﬁculty is that it is unclear why one proﬁle
column should be used to generate the scores and the other to average them.
It is simple, however, to symmetrize this approach and deﬁne the score
3*" {5+1}? (Mittelman et a1., 2003), which we call sdot-fs. Variations on
this idea replace the observed frequencies]? and 35’ with either the observed
counts or the predicted frequencies, to yield respectively the scores sdot-cs

and sdot-qs (Heger and Holm, 2003; Mittelman et a1., 2003; Panchenko,
2003).

A modiﬁcation of sdot-cs, implemented in the program Compass
(Sadreyev and Grishin, 2003), and which we call comp-cs, is

a, a a, (c’—1)Z.§’+(c—1)Z’.§

C(Z,c,s,s)E “Ira—2 (9)

A motivation for this deﬁnition is that it reduces to the standard proﬁle-
sequence substitution score when one of the columns consists of a single
observation. We will also consider the scoring system comp-fs, with the same
limiting property, in which the count vectors in Equation (9) are replaced by
observed frequency vectors. For either comp-es or comp-fs, when both c and
c’ are 1 the substitution score may be deﬁned using a standard pairwise score
matrix.

As described above, we here calculate (1‘ and (1" and the resulting 3 and 3’
using the Dirichlet mixture method in lieu of the data-dependent pseudocount
method employed by PSI-BLAST (Altschul et a1., 1997) and in Sadreer and
Grishin (2003); Wang and Dunbrack (2004).

2.4.7 BILD scores Altschul et a1. (2010) recently proposed a
generalization of pairwise log-odds substitution scores to proﬁleiproﬁle
alignments. Speciﬁcally, they assumed an M -component Dirichlet mixture
prior, with mixture parameters (m; i = 1,2,...,M) and Dirichlet parameters
(0131-; i: 1,2, ...,M;j= 1,2, ...,20). Then the probability of observing a
speciﬁc column with count vector 3 is given by

where 011521-013]- and 1"(-) is the Gamma function. The BILD score for
aligning two columns with count vectors Z and Z’ is then

3 RESULTS

We evaluated the proﬁle—proﬁle substitution scores described above
on proﬁle pairs generated as described in Section 2. Specifying either
10 or 20 aggregate sequences, we generated 2400 aligned proﬁle
pairs 73 and 77’ for each mean percent identity bin. For each pair,
we calculated the quality scores 1'11, 1'12 and 1'13 deﬁned above,
either using sequence weights or not. We omitted, however, from
this calculation any columns of 73 or 77’ containing over 25% gap
characters. For each substitution score, the mean values of 1'11,
using weights, are shown in Figure 2. These values are signiﬁcant
to approximately the ﬁrst digit past the decimal. In each column, the
largest 1'11 is italicized, and all 1'11 that differ by <1% (in absolute
rather than relative value) are shown in bold. In addition, for ease
of interpretation, the differences between each value of 1'11 and the
maximum in its column are represented in a color panel to the right
of the table of numbers. We discuss below several broad features of
Figure 2, and the relationship of its data to those that result when
various parameters of our analysis are varied.

For each score, the values of 1'11 increase both with the mean
percent identity between proﬁles, and with their aggregate number
of sequences. This is ﬁllly expected, as both changes should render
it easier to align the proﬁle columns correctly.

The performances of certain pairs of scores, i.e. (dot-g and
[dot-g) and (dot-r and 1d0t-r), are indistinguishable by I'll. Brief
consideration reveals that this will be true of any scores that may be
mapped to one another by a monotonic function. Nevertheless, we

continue to consider both scores from each pair because the quality
measures 1'12 and 1'13 do in fact distinguish them.

We now turn to examining the relative performance of the 39
substitution scores. Several scores, namely Euclid-g, Euclid- r, dot-s,
rank-q, rank-r, aS-q and laQ-q, do quite poorly—more than 5
percentage points worse than the best score—in most or all columns
of Figure 2. The score sdot-fs (Mittelman et (11., 2003), a simple
average of proﬁle-sequence scores, outperforms all others in 75%
of the columns, and is second best to the related sdot-qs in the
remaining 25%. The ideas of using observed counts (sdot-cs) or
predicted frequencies (sdot-qs) in place of the observed frequencies
to calculate this average do not, in general, yield an improvement,
nor does the idea of giving extra weight to the proﬁle-sequence
scores derived from the larger proﬁle (comp-fs; comp-cs). After sdot-
fs and closely related scores, BILD scores (Altschul et (11., 2010)
usually perform second best, and YL-q scores (Yona and Levitt,
2002) third; both almost always yield a 1'11 within 2 percentage
points of the best.

In 47.9% of the cases shown in Figure 2, employing sequence
weights yields a worse value for 1'11 than does leaving the
proﬁle data unweighted. The differences between the values of 1'11
when weights are employed and when they are not is shown in
Supplementary Figure S1. It is somewhat surprising that weights
degrade performance so often. Of course, for the alignments used
to generate the test set, some care has been taken to eliminate
redundancy. Thus, sequence weighting is less likely to be of
value for our than for more general proﬁle pairs. Nevertheless,
Supplementary Figure S1 shows clearly that the weights we have
employed (Altschul et (11., 2009; Sunyaev et (11., 1999) tend to
improve most scoring systems’ performances at low mean sequence
identity (5—15%), but to hurt them at moderate identity (25—35%),
and this effect is more pronounced the more sequences the proﬁles
contain. Also, it is evident that these weights are substantially better
adapted to certain proﬁle—proﬁle scoring systems than to others.
The use of weights or not does not alter in any substantive way
our conclusions concerning which proﬁle—proﬁle scoring systems
are best. However, that weighting degrades so many of the 1'11,
some very signiﬁcantly, implies that much remains unknown about
the proper construction of sequence weights, at least for use with
proﬁle—proﬁle substitution scores. Pursuing such an analysis further
is beyond the scope of this article.

It is advisable to consider quality measures based upon multiple
columns, so we have performed experiments similar to those
described above for 1'12 and 1'13. The results are given in
Supplementary Figures S2 and S3. We observe, ﬁrst, that by
these measures, a monotonic function applied to a scoring system
now affects its quality, because the magnitude of the scores
becomes relevant once they are added. As a result, dot-g becomes
distinguishable from 1d0t-g, and dot-r from 1d0t-r. Second, as more
adjacent columns are considered, it becomes easier to distinguish
correct from incorrect alignments. For alignment pairs containing
20 total sequence, with 30—35% mean sequence identity, the best
scoring system has a >99% chance, and almost every other scoring
system a > 94% chance, of assigning the correct alignment of three
adjacent columns a better score than an incorrect alignment. We
could extend our measure to four or more adjacent columns, but
such an analysis eventually becomes irrelevant. There are a few
minor differences between the one-, two- and three-column results.
The basic ﬁnding stands that sdot-fs and related scores in general

perform best. The relatively poor performance of BILD scores at
low mean sequence identity is more apparent, but as we will see
below, this deﬁcit may be mitigated by using different Dirichlet
mixture priors. Also, for 1'12 and 1'13, the performance of ldot-qr
scores (Soding, 2005) rises to among the best.

One may construct predicted frequencies 21‘ for an alignment
column using a variety of priors for the Dirichlet mixture method,
as well as by using the alternative data-dependent pseudocount
method (Altschul et (11., 1997; Tatusov et (11., 1994) with a standard
pairwise substitution matrix. To study whether our results are
sensitive to these variations, we reran our experiments for the
quality measure 1'11 with sequence weights, but using ‘recode4’,
‘recode5’ and ‘fournier’ Dirichlet mixture priors (Supplementary
Tables S2b, S2c, S2d; http://compbio.soe.ucsc.edu/dirichlets/index
.html) in the place of ‘recode3’, as well as using the data-
dependent pseudocount method in conjunction with the BLOSUM-
62 substitution matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992). We compare
the results to those using ‘recode3’ in Supplementary Figure S4.
Many of the scoring systems we have studied make no use of
predicted frequencies, so these are omitted from the comparison.
Also, as discussed above, BILD scores can be used only with
the Dirichlet mixture method. As can be seen, different Dirichlet
priors may be optimal for different scoring systems. For example,
‘recode4’ priors yield the best average results for YL-q, ‘recode3’ for
sdot-fs and ‘fournier’ for BILD. Furthermore, the data-dependent
pseudocount method yields better results than does the Dirichlet
mixture method for most scoring systems, but not for sdot-fs and

most related scores. Nevertheless, even when each scoring system
is paired with its optimal method for estimating 21‘, our basic
conclusions still hold.

4 CONCLUSION

In this article, we have addressed the isolated question of how
best to deﬁne substitution scores for proﬁle—proﬁle comparison.
Using gold standard multiple alignment datasets, we constructed
pairs of proﬁles with known alignment. We then measured the
quality of a scoring system by the probability with which it rated
properly aligned columns better than improperly aligned ones. This
evaluation method has several advantages, as described above.

Our results suggest that among the wide variety of substitution
scores considered, the best are variations on sequence-proﬁle based
scores, most notably sdot-fs (Mittelman et (11., 2003), followed fairly
closely by BILD (Altschul et (11., 2010), YL-q (Yona and Levitt,
2002) and ldot-qr (Soding, 2005) scores. BILD scores have various
attractive theoretical features; for example, they yield a consistent
measure of multiple alignment similarity, and may help deﬁne the
proper boundaries of a homologous domains (Altschul et (11 ., 2010).
Although BILD scores may be preferred for these reasons, this study
suggests that other scores may be somewhat superior for the simple
purpose of proﬁle—proﬁle comparison.

To the extent that previous studies have been able to distinguish
among the scoring systems they considered, their results are broadly
consistent with ours. For example, Mittelman et (11. (2003) took an

evaluation approach different than ours, but one that also avoided
deﬁning gap and offset scores. They found that, among those
scores they considered, the best were YL-q (Yona and Levitt, 2002),
and several sequence proﬁle-based scores, probably led by comp-
cs (Sadreyev and Grishin, 2003). BILD and ldot-qr scores, of
course, had yet to be deﬁned. Several studies that required the
ﬁtting of gap and offset costs (Edgar and Sjolander, 2004; Wang
and Dunbrack, 2004) were unable to demonstrate much signiﬁcant
difference among most of the scores they considered.

Because of this article’s focus, it is silent upon the questions of
how best to weight correlated sequences within a multiple alignment
when constructing a proﬁle, and on how best to deﬁne gap and offset
scores for use with the recommended substitution scores. Any fully
ﬁlnctional proﬁle—proﬁle alignment program needs to address these
questions. It is hoped, however, that by restricting the variety of
substitution scores that are best considered, it will be easier to take
up these additional issues.

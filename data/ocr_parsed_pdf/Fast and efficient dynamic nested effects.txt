ABSTRACT

Motivation: Targeted interventions in combination with the
measurement of secondary effects can be used to computationally
reverse engineer features of upstream non-transcriptional signaling
cascades. Nested effect models (NEMs) have been introduced as
a statistical approach to estimate the upstream signal flow from
downstream nested subset structure of perturbation effects. The
method was substantially extended later on by several authors and
successfully applied to various datasets. The connection of NEMs to
Bayesian Networks and factor graph models has been highlighted.
Results: Here, we introduce a computationally attractive extension
of NEMs that enables the analysis of perturbation time series data,
hence allowing to discriminate between direct and indirect signaling
and to resolve feedback loops.

1 INTRODUCTION

Reverse engineering of biological networks is a key for the
understanding of biological systems. The exact knowledge of
interdependencies between proteins in the living cell is crucial for
the identiﬁcation of drug targets for various diseases. However, due
to the complexity of the system a complete picture with detailed
knowledge of the behavior of individual proteins is still out of reach.
Nonetheless, the advent of gene perturbation techniques like RNA
interference (RNAi) (Fire et al., 1998), opened new perspectives for
network reconstruction by boosting the ability to subject organisms
to well-deﬁned interventions.

In general, biological networks are represented mathematically
by a graph in which the nodes represent biological entities and the
edges encode functional relations (of various kinds) between these
entities. A number of approaches have been proposed in the literature
for estimating networks from perturbation effects. Many of these
aim at reconstructing a network from directly observable effects.
For example, Rung et al. (2002) build a directed disruption graph
by drawing an edge (i,j), if gene 1' results in a signiﬁcant expression

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

change at gene j . Wagner (2001) uses such disruption networks as a
starting point for a further graph-theoretic method, which removes
indirect effects (Aho et al., 1972), hence making the network more
parsimonious. Tresch et al. (2007) and Klamt et al. (2010) enhance
this approach by additionally making use of edge probabilities and
signs to make the network consistent with the observed biological
effects.

Moreover, Bayesian Networks have been used to model the
statistical dependency between perturbation experiments (Maathuis
et al., 2009, 2010; Pe’er et al., 2001; Sachs et al., 2005). For
this purpose Pearl (2000) introduces his d0 calculus, an idealized
model of interventions. Other probabilistic graphical models that
have been proposed to model interventional data comprise factor
graphs (Gat-Viks et al., 2006) and dependency networks (Rogers
and Girolami, 2005). In genetics, epistasis analysis is often been
applied for learning from indirect downstream effects. For example,
Driessche et al. (2005) use expression proﬁles from single and
double knockdowns to partly reconstruct a developmental pathway
in Dictyostelium discoideum via a simple Cluster analysis. Kanabar
et al. (2009) embedds epistasis analysis into a statistical framework.
Battle et al. (2010) propose a special kind of Bayesian Network
to infer pathway structures from genetic interaction data. All of
these approaches deal with static data. However, with the increasing
availability of time-resolved data, it is desirable and helpful to model
the temporal aspects of signaling. To this end, differential equation
systems have been suggested e.g. by Nelander et al. (2008).

Our approach is an expansion of Nested eﬁ’ects models (NEMS)
(Anchang et al., 2009; Frohlich et al., 2007, 2008, 2009; Markowetz
et al., 2005, 2007; Tresch and Markowetz, 2008; Vaske et al., 2009;
Zeller et al., 2009). NEMs are speciﬁcally designed to learn the
signaling ﬂow—on a transcriptional as well as non-transcriptional
level—between perturbed genes from indirect, high-dimensional
effects, typically monitored by DNA microarrays. NEMs use
a graphical modeling framework to compare a given network
hypothesis with the observed nested structure of downstream effects.
In conclusion, NEMs estimate an interaction network between
hidden entities from a set of observable downstream effects. NEMs
have been applied successfully to a number of datasets, e.g. the
immune response in Drosophila melanogaster (Markowetz et al.,
2005), a transcription factor network in Saccharomices cerevisiae
(Markowetz et (11., 2007), the ER-a pathway in human breast cancer
cells (Frohlich et al., 2007, 2008), a synthetic lethality interactions
network in S.cerevisiae (Zeller et al., 2009), murine stem cell
development in mice (Anchang et al., 2009) and the Rosetta dataset
for S.cerevisiae (Vaske et al., 2009).

Dynamic nested effects models

 

This article complements the attempt of Anchang et al. (2009)
to extend static NEMs to the modeling of perturbation time series
measurements. Most importantly, this allows for the resolution
of feedback loops in the signaling cascade, as well as for the
discrimination of direct and indirect signalling. In contrast to
Anchang et al. the key idea in our model is to unroll the signal
ﬂow over time. This allows for a computation showing some
similarity to Dynamic Bayesian Networks and naturally extends
the classical NEM formulation introduced by Markowetz et al. Our
model circumvents the need for time consuming Gibbs sampling,
which makes it also computationally attractive.

2 METHODS
2.1 NEMs

For self-containedness. we start with a brief review of the original statistical
inference framework by Markowetz et al. (2005). In this framework. one
distinguishes between silenced/perturbed entities (genes or proteins. which
cannot be observed directly). called S-genes (S) and other entities (genes or
proteins) showing a measurable downstream effect (E-genes. 8). The idea of
NEMs is to separate the upstream signaling pathway (the graph connecting
the S-genes) from the downstream signaling (the graph connecting S-genes to
E-genes). Consequently. the edge set of a NEM is partitioned into a directed
edge set connecting S-genes among themselves. and another one describing
the connections between the S-genes and the E-genes. It is assumed that each
E-gene is attached to at most one S-gene only. Knocking down a speciﬁc
S-gene Sk interrupts the signal ﬂow in the downstream pathway. and hence
an effect on the E-genes attached to Sk or one of the S-genes depending on Sk
is expected. Perturbng each S-gene once will thus result in a nested subset
structure of effects. which can be used to reverse engineer the upstream
signal ﬂow graph (Fig. l).

The linking of E-genes to S-genes is formally represented by a binary
|8| >< |8| matrix (92(80) with 9,721. if effectj is linked to S-gene i and
@ij :0 otherwise. The cross-talk between S-genes (our network hypothesis)
is given by a binary |S| >< |8| matrix <I> =(<I>ij). with (DU- :1 whenever
S-gene i is upstream of S-gene j. and the convention <I>ii=l for all 1'68.
A (static) NEM assumes that perturbing S-gene s e 8 leads to an observable
downstream effect for E-gene e 68. if there is a path from s to e. i.e. there
exists an s’ 68. such that (1)55/ =1 and 85/921. Hence. matrices <I> and (9
together determine whether a perturbation of s e S has an effect on a E-gene
e e 8. Similarly. if several S-genes S E 8 have been perturbed simultaneously.
an E-gene is affected if there is a path from at least one of the S-genes in S to
the respective E-gene. Suppose we have conducted a set [C of perturbation
experiments. For each experiment k 6 IC. let Sk E 8 denote the set of S-genes
that has been actively perturbed. Note that at this point we generalize the
original formulation of NEMs (Markowetz et al.. 2005) in a way that allows
for the integration of combinatorial perturbations.

Let D=(ij) be a |IC| >< |S | matrix of experimentally observed effects.
The entry of ij is a collection of all observations of E-gene j under the
perturbation(s) of Sk. It may consist of counts of how often a speciﬁc
gene showed a knockdown effect among 6 experiment repetitions. as
originally proposed by Markowetz et al. (2005). Alternatively. Frohlich et al.
(2007. 2008) and Tresch and Markowetz (2008) suggested using log P-Value
densities and log odds ratios. respectively. which are closely related to each
other (Frohlich et al.. 2009).

In general. a NEM model can be scored according to a likelihood function
of the form:

p<DI<I>.0>=1‘[1‘[p(DikI<I>.®> (1)
ieS kelC
The local likelihoods p(Dik | <1), 8) are the building blocks of the NEM.
A meaningful way to deﬁne these local likelihoods and calculate them
efﬁciently is described in the Supplementary Material.

 

Effects

NEM is parametrized by a directed graph between S-genes encoded by <I>.
together with a directed graph attaching each E-gene to an S-gene given
by (9. (b) Relation of perturbations and observable effects. A perturbation
of S-gene S2 affects the downstream signaling pathway (S3). and hence an
effect on the E-genes attached to S2 and to S3. namely E2 respectively E3. is
predicted (grey shading).

2.2 Dynamic NEMs (dynoNEMs)

The above model monitors static perturbation effects. Speciﬁcally. a
perturbation signal is supposed to propagate deterministically through the
whole S-gene network <I>. Cycles in <I> imply that perturbation effects are
indistinguishable within this model. As a matter of principle. it is impossible
to detect feedback loops in <I>. Thus. it is highly desirable to have time series
measurements of perturbation effects. which help resolve biological feedback
loops and distinguish direct from indirect effects.

From now on we suppose our data D to consist of a time series. i.e. D:
{DU-(t) | t: l,  T}. These measurements could be P-Values. counts or any
other kind of statistics quantifying the effect of a knockdown for E-gene 1'
under perturbation of S-gene j at time I (see Supplementary Material). The
time variable I here denotes the index of a time point in a discrete time series.
but not the time point itself.

As an example. suppose the biological ‘truth’ is given by the signaling
pathway shown in Figure la. We unroll the signal ﬂow in this network
over time (Fig. 2) in the following way: the node set 8(t)={E(t),EES}.
8(1): {S(t), S e S} of the dynamic network consists of a copy of the static
network nodes. one for each timepoint t = l,  T. An E-gene E(t) is linked
to S(t) whenever E is linked to S in the static situation. i.e. it is determined
by the same matrix (9 as in the static case. The actual unrolling takes
place in the wiring of the S-genes. Informally. the static adjacency matrix
<I> is converted to a |8| >< |S| weighted adjacency matrix ‘1! =(\Ili]-). where
0 means no edge and a value \Ilij>0 implies an inﬂuence of node i on
E-genes downstream of node j delayed by \Ilij time steps. Speciﬁcally. we
have T3 \Ilij Z (1),»!- for i,jeS. A non-zero entry \Ilij #0 implies that there
are edges Si(t)—> SJ-(t+\ll,»j). t: l,...,T—\Ilij. Furthermore. we make the
convention ‘11,»): 1. Please note again that we neither aim to model physical
signaling nor downstream transcription times. Instead. a positive time lag
between nodes i and j in our model describes the number of time steps. after
which a knockdown of node 1' results in an observed effect downstream of
node j. This speciﬁcally implies that we do not need any assumptions about
the physical time it takes a signal at node j to produce a downstream effect
at an E-gene.

In contrast to classical Dynamic Bayesian Networks (Ghahramani. 1997).
an edge in our model may not connect consecutive time layers. but it may

skip a certain amount of time steps (as it is the case for the entry \115253 2 2 in
Figure 2. which implies the edge S2(l)—> S3(3). In other words. we do not
rely on a ﬁrst order Markov assumption in our model. In this way. we model
the unknown and variable time delays in perturbation responses due to the
upstream signaling. In the following. we refer to this model as dynoNEM. The
likelihood formula for dynoNEMs is given as (c.f. Supplementary Material):

T
p(D I W): HZ H Hmmm I III. 8,». = 1>Pr(®,;. = 1) (2)

ieSseleelCtzl

To compute p(D,»k(t)|\Il,®,»S=l) according to the proposed unrolling
of the signal ﬂow. we introduce a time-dependent Boolean perturbation
state for each S-gene s. which we encode with 0 (perturbed. S-gene is
underexpressed or overexpressed) and l (unperturbed. S-gene is naturally
expressed). respectively. A knockdown of s corresponds to a switch 1 —> 0.
Since the perturbation state of s at a particular time step t is not observable.
we identify it with the value [s(t)] of a random variable s(t). Let pa(s)(t)
denote the set of parents nodes of s at time t (i.e. the set {plO <\Il],5 <t}
iwhich can be empty. if appropriate). Then. according to the unrolling of
the signal ﬂow over time. we write:

mam) | ‘1'. e... = 1) = (3)
Z (mam) I m): [so] . e... = 1)-
[s(t)] 6(0, 1)
Prom = [so] mama»)

In the absence of more precise information. we deﬁne:

Pr(s(z>=0 Ipa(s>(z>= [r]) = 1 3” EP“F“(’>= [’71 =1 (4)
O otherw1se

Pr(S(l)=1|W(S)(l)=[rl) = 1- PIN!) =0 lpa(S)(l) = [r])

The deﬁnition means that s is perturbed at time t. if any of its parents
(including s itself) are perturbed.

We are now left with the deﬁnition of the local likelihoods p(Dik (t) | s(t) =
[s(t)],®,;.= l). which can be calculated efﬁciently in a similiar fashion as
for static NEMs. Details are described in the Supplementary Material.

2.3 A prior for network structures and time delays

In the above paragraph. we introduced the weighted adjacency matrix ‘1! as
a compact representation of the raw upstream network structure and time

delays between perturbation events and downstream responses. Learning an
upstream signaling cascade now amounts to learning matrix ‘1! based on the
likelihood in Equation (2). While scoring candidate network structures ‘1!
we assume higher edge weights (i.e. observing an effect after longer time
lag) to be less likely than small edge weights. Morever. we have to ensure
that redundant edges. i.e. edges which are principally not observable do not
appear. In other words. addition of these edges to ‘1! does not change the
likelihood of our model. In general. edges x—> y are redundant. if their time
lag is larger or equal than the length of some other path from x to y. where
the path length is deﬁned here as the sum of the path’s time lags.

We specify our demands in form of a prior 1701'). Additionally to punishing
higher edge weights. 1701') should enable us to include prior knowledge into
the network scoring. i.e. to bias the scoring toward known interactions. For
this purpose. we assume to have a given matrix \ll of prior probabilities for
each edge. Frohlich et al. (2007) proposed the following prior for \11:

1 — \11, —\il,~
p(W|v)=Hﬁexp<¥) (5)
111'

where v > 0 is an adjustable scaling parameter. The parameter 12 can be chosen
according to the BIC criterion:

BIC: —2logp(D| <I>)+log(|8|)Zl{|\Ilij Airy-I >0}
u

where ELI-1hqu —\llij| > 0} is an estimate of the number of parameters in
the model.

In the default case (which is employed in our subsequent studies). we
suppose \i1 to be an empty graph. This way sparse network structures are
favored.

2.4 Network learning for dynoNEMs

Network learning in our case amounts to ﬁnd an optimal weighted adjacency
matrix ‘11. where the entries \Ilij can take on discrete values 0,...,T. We
employ a greedy hill climbing strategy here. For this purpose. we deﬁne
three search operators: edge weight increase (\Ilij I—> \Ilij +1. if \Ilij < T). edge
weight decrease (\Ilij I—> \Ilij — 1. if \Ilij > 0). edge reversal (exchange of \Ilij
and \Ilji) . At each search step. we are applying all possible operators and
accept the solution increasing the posterior likelihood most. This requires
0(|S |2) likelihood evaluations per search step. where each likelihood
computation according to Equation (2) has a time complexity of 0(Tlé' | |8 |2)
by itself. Hence. each search step requires 0(Tlé' “8 l4) time.

To further assess the conﬁdence of the inferred network hypothesis on real
experimental data. we employ non-parametric bootstrapping (1000 times).
That means. from the whole set 8 of available downstream effects we
randomly draw bootstrap samples 8’ E8 of size |S | with replacement. On
each bootstrap sample. we estimate a network hypothesis using greedy hill
climbing. This allows us to estimate conﬁdence intervals for each \Ilij.

2.5 Related approaches

2.5.1 DNEMs A ﬁrst approach for learning from perturbation time series
was proposed recently by Anchang et al. (2009). Our method differs from
theirs according to the following aspects:

(1) We do not aim to infer the true upstream signaling time from
downstream effects. Instead we only estimate the time lag between
a perturbation and an observed downstream effect. This allows us to
unroll the signal ﬂow in the upstream signaling cascade over time.

(2) Thanks to this trick we do not have to use time consuming Gibbs
sampling. Instead. we employ a simple greedy hill climbing strategy
in combination with a non-parametric bootstrap to assess conﬁdences
of inferred edges. This makes our approach much more practical and
efﬁcient.

2.5.2 Static NEMs for time series Supposed that measurements of all time
points were statistically independent one can in principle directly apply static
NEMs to time series data. In case of statistical independency of time points.
we have

[:1
then we retrieve back the classical likelihood formula for NEMs (see
Supplementary Material). The difference of dynoNEMs to this idea is the
propagation of perturbation effects over time using the time lags (Equation 3).

Aprinciple problem when applying the static NEM approach in the context
of time series data is that structures with the same transitive closure are
likelihood equivalent. i.e. cannot be distinguished. For that reason. we use the
maximum a-posteori (MAP) approach introduced in Tresch and Markowetz
here instead (Tresch and Markowetz. 2008). In this approach. the assignment
of E-genes to S-genes encoded in the parameter (9 is not integrated out.
but estimated explicitely. This in principle allows to distinguish direct from
indirect perturbation effects. and thus breaks the likelihood equivalence. A
comparision between the MAP approach and the classical NEM approach
can be found in Frohlich et al. (2009).

We use greedy hill climbing to learn the network structure for time
series data Via a static NEM. Search operations are edge insertion. edge
deletion and edge reversal. and the greedy hill climber is initialized with an
empty network. The same prior for network structures as described above is
employed to enforce sparsity of the solution. In the following. we will use
the static NEM approach as a ‘ground truth” for method comparison.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulations

3.1.1 Network sampling To assess the reconstruction
performance of our approach, we ran simulations on 10 networks
with n S-genes (n was varied during our simulations, see below),
which were generated in a random fashion from KEGG signaling
pathways as follows: a random KEGG signaling pathway was
picked as base graph. Only gene—gene interactions were considered
within that graph. Within the chosen pathway, a core node was
selected randomly. Starting from that core node a random walk
(visiting nodes with equal probability) was started and continued
until the total number of visited nodes was n. The subgraph of
visited nodes was regarded as an S-gene network, and a set of m
E-genes (m is varied during our simulations) was attached uniform
randomly to all these S-genes. Finally, time lags for edges between
connected S-genes were sampled from the set {1,2,3,4} via a
geometric distribution with parameter p. Doing so, we ensured that
an indirect edge x—>y had always a time lag being smaller than
than the sum of time lags on all other paths from x to y, i.e. we did
not get redundant edges.

We further ensured that at least one of the sampled networks was
cyclic. All sampled networks can be found in the Supplementary
Material.

3.1.2 Data sampling To generate data for the sampled 10
networks, we simulated knockdowns of each of the network S-
genes according to Equation (4). That means, if S-gene k was
‘knocked out’, then a downstream S-gene s was supposed to be
perturbed as soon as the perturbation signal reached s (here the
time lags came into play). If s was perturbed at time t, then

we sampled ‘P-values’ for all E-genes attached to s from the f1
distribution (see Supplementary Material), otherwise from a uniform
distribution (i.e. we supposed to have only one control available,
see Supplementary Material). The parameters for the f1 distribution
were itself drawn randomly in the same manner as described
in Frohlich et al. (2009). Afterwards the local effect likelihoods
p(Dl-k(t)|s(t)=[s(t)],®is=1) were estimated using again the f1
distribution, but this time with slightly different parameters in order
to simulate the estimation error of distribution parameters occuring
in practice (see Supplementary Material for details).

The whole data generation process was repeated 100 times for
each network and each parameter conﬁguration being investigated
in the following.

3.1.3 Dependency on time lag distribution In a ﬁrst simulation,
we investigated the dependency of our dynoNEM and static NEM
models on the time lag distribution for networks with n = 5 S-genes,
m: 100 E-genes and time series of length T: 10, i.e. we varied
the parameter p of the geometric distribution. The dependency
was measured in terms of sensitivity and speciﬁcity (1 — false
positive rate) of network reconstruction. Moreover, for dynoNEMs
we recored the mean squared error (MSE) of estimated time lags. It
is worth mentioning that the hill climber for the dynoNEM model
was always initialized with the network estimated by a static NEM.
We also tested an initialization with an empty graph, but did not ﬁnd
much difference to the results presented here. A direct comparison
to the DEM approach by Anchang et al. was impossible due to the
prohibitively high computation time for their method.

Since in this simulation T was (intentially) much larger than the
maximum time lag of 4, the result showing an almost constant
behavior of sensitivity, speciﬁcity and MSE over the whole
parameter range was somehwat expected (Figures in Supplementary
Material). It demonstrated that provided we have long enough time
series the reconstruction quality is independent of the shape of
the time lag distribution. Besides that, it is worth mentioning that
our dynoNEMs achieved a sensitivity of >90% with a speciﬁctiy
of almost 100%, whereas static NEMs had much lower average
sensitivity of ~80% and speciﬁcity of ~90%.

3.1.4 Dependency on length of time series In a next simulation,
we looked at the inﬂuence of the lenght T of the time series for
networks with n=5 S-genes, m: 100 E-genes and P ﬁxed to 0.5
(Figures 3 and 4, rest in Supplementary Material). As expected, an
increase of the number of time points lead to a strong improved
sensitivity for both, dynoNEMs and static NEMs. The average
difference in sensitivity between both methods remained between 15
and 20%. Like before, dynoNEMs achieved a very high speciﬁcity of
almost 100%, even with a low number of time points, whereas static
NEMs showed a slight decrease of speciﬁcity with an increasing
number of time points. The MSE of estimated time lags dropped to
almost 0 with increasing T.

3.1.5 Dependency on number of S- and E-genes In a third
simulation, we investigated the performance for a varying number
of E-genes with n=5, 10 and 15 S-genes and time series of length
T: 10. Time lags were sampled from a geometric distribution with
P :05 (Figures 5 and 6. The dependence on the choice of p,
i.e. the inﬂuence of the signaling times prior has been evaluated in
Section 3 of the Supplementary Material). In all cases, the dynoNEM

model led to a consistently better sensitivity and speciﬁcity than the
static NEM model, with improvements in sensitivity and speciﬁctiy
of ~15—20%. At the same time, the simulation demonstrated that
already with a rather low number of E-genes, dynoNEMs reach a
rather good reconstruction accuracy. For instance, for n = 5 it seems
that just 25 E-genes are sufﬁcient to get a sensitivity of >90%.
Like before, the speciﬁcity was constantly >95%. With increasing
network size, i.e. larger n, the sensitivity drops slightly to 80% (n:
10, 100 E-genes) and 70% (n: 15, 300 E-genes), respectively, but
the speciﬁcity remains constantly >95% (Figures in Supplementary
Material).

3.1.6 Dependency on network architecture We ﬁnally
investigated, whether there were systematic differences in the
reconstruction accuracy for each of our sampled networks. We
compared the sensitivities and speciﬁcities for each network
with n=5 S-genes, m=100 E-genes, time lags sampled with
P :05 and varying parameter T (see Supplementary Material).
This simulation showed for longer time series an inﬂuence of
the network architecture, whereas for smaller ones the length of
the time series was the dominating factor. Speciﬁcally, the cyclic

network #10 appeared to be harder to learn in terms of sensitivity
and speciﬁcity than the other ones, and also the indirect edge in
network #2 caused sometimes difﬁculties. Nonetheless, a detailed
investigation of the frequency with which individual edges were
inferred clearly revealed that dynoNEMs were in general able
to identify feed-forward and feed-back loops correctly with high
accuracy, even from short time series (see Supplementary Material).

3.2 Application to murine stem cell development

We applied dynoNEMs to a dataset investigating molecular
mechanisms of self-renewal in murine embryonic stem cells
(Ivanova et al., 2006). The dataset consists of time series microarray
measurements for RNAi knockdowns of each of the six genes
namely, Nanog, 0ct4, Sox2, Esrrb, Tbx3 and TclI . Mouse embryonic
stem cells (ESCs) were grown in the presence of leukemia inhibitory
factor (LIF), thus retaining their undifferentiated self-renewing
state (positive controls). Differentiation-associated changes in gene
expression were measured by replacing LIF with retinoic acid (RA),
thus inducing differentiation of stem cells (negative controls). RNAi
silencing of the six afore mentioned genes was done in (LIF+,
RA—) cell culturs to investigate their potential for induced cell

differentiation. Microarray expression measurements at 6—7 time
points in 1-day intervals were taken for the two controls (positive
and negative) and the six RNAi assays.

The dataset by Ivanova et al. (2006) was measured once on
Affymetrix MOE430A and once on MOE430B chips. The authors
normalized both datasets via the MAS 5.0 software (Hubbell et al.,
2002). In consistency with Anchang et al. (2009) for the following
analysis, we only concentrated on the Affymetrix MOE430A chip
series. In our framework, the six genes Nanog, 0ct4, Sox2, Esrrb,
Tbx3 and TclI correspond to S-genes, and all genes showing a
signiﬁcant fold change in response to LIF depletion are E-genes.
We here used the same set of 122 E-genes and the same data
discretization procedure as described in Anchang et al. (2009).

We applied our dynoNEM model within a non-parametric
bootstrap procedure and recorded, how often each edge appeared in
1000 inferred networks (one network per bootstrap sample). We then
computed exact binomial distribution conﬁdence intervals (95%)
for the appearence probability of each edge via R-package binom
(Dorai-Raj, 2009). The validity of bootstrap probabilities for edges
was further checked in a simulation (see Supplementary Material).
Only edges with lower conﬁdence bound >50% were regarded as
reliable and shown in Figure 7. The median time lags for all edges
were 1, i.e. had the same speed.

There are several similarities to the inferred network shown in
Anchang et al. (2009), which was obtained via the DNEM method,
namely the cascades Tbx3—>Esrrb—> 0ct4—> Tcl 1, Nanog—>
0ct4—> Tcll and Sox2—> 0ct4—> Tcll. A further striking similarity
is that the transcription factor 0ct4 regulating Tcll is itself jointly
regulated by the three transcription factors Nanong, Sox2 and Esrrb.
In contrast to Anchang et al., in our network Nanog is not placed
upstream of Sox2 and does not have any indirect outgoing edges.
Indeed, the only shortcut in our network is Sox2—> Tcll. Our
network is thus more sparse than the one shown by Anchang et al.
This can be partially attributed to our structure prior (Section 2.3),
which favors sparse networks. A comparison of the pure graph
structures (neglecting edge probabilities) of both, our network and
the network by Anchang et al., via our likelihood model favored
our network with a Bayes factor of 2.14 X 1018. Thus, we believe
that the reason for the (relatively small) differences between our

network and Anchang et al. are a mixture of a different likelihood
model combined with a sparsity prior.

A further comparison of our dynoNEM network with a
reconstruction based on static NEMs can be found in the
Supplementary Material.

For validation purposes, we next performed a literature-based
reconstruction of the six gene network via the MetaCoreTM
software (GeneGo Inc.) showing eight known transcriptional and
three known non-transcriptional regulations (see Supplementary
Material). The sub-networks Sox2—>0ct4—>Tcl1 and Esrrb—>
0ct4—>Tcl1 appearing in our data-based reconstruction can be
found in this literature network as well as Nanog and Tbx3 being
placed upstream of 0ct4. The edges Sox2—> Tcll and Nanog—>
0ct4, which both appear in our network and the one shown
in Anchang et al. (2009) can be explained by the fact that
Sox2 binds to 0ct4, which itself binds to Essrb, to which also
Nanog binds (Bilodeau et al., 2009). Hence, Sox2—>Tcll and
Nanog—> 0ct4 are most likely mediated through 0ct4 and Essrb,
respectively. Likewise, Tbx3—>Esrrb can be interpreted as being
mediated through 0ct4. A different way of interpretation was given
by Anchang et al., who noted that feed-forward loops, such as
Sox2—> Tcl 1, Nanog—> 0ct4 and Tbx—>Esrrb, are very frequent
motifs in transcriptional networks and could serve to stabilize the
differentiated state of cells relative to the self-renewal state, hence
making cell differentiation a mainly unidirectional process (c.f.
Alon, 2006).

Summing up, we mainly see known transcriptional regulations,
and our network is consistent with the known literature.

4 CONCLUSON

We developed a novel approach to infer signaling cascades
from high-dimensional perturbation time series measurements via
dynoNEMs, hence allowing to discriminate direct from indirect
perturbation effects and to resolve feedback loops. Our approach
directly extends the NEMs framework introduced by Markowetz
et al. from the static to the dynamic case by unrolling the network
structure over time. This idea allows for a fast and efﬁcient
computation of the likelihood ﬁinction without any time consuming
Gibbs sampling. Our simulations revealed a high accuracy of
network reconstruction for sufﬁciently small networks (up to 15
nodes). Thanks to the incorporated network structure prior, we
achieved a consistantly high speciﬁcity, i.e. low false positive rate.
Applying our dynoNEMs to estimate the network between six
proteins (ﬁve transcription factors) playing a key role in murine stem
cell development, we found a good agreement with results published
by Achang et al. and with the biological literature. We therefore
believe that our approach can serve as a useﬁil tool to generate data-
driven hypotheses about signaling and/or transcriptional networks
based on high-dimensional perturbation effects.

Abstract

Motivation: Recent completion of the global proteomic characterization of The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) colorectal cancer (CRC) cohort resulted in the first tumor dataset with complete mo—
lecular measurements at DNA, RNA and protein levels. Using CRC as a paradigm, we describe the
application of the NetGestalt framework to provide easy access and interpretation of multi—omics
data.

Results: The NetGestalt CRC portal includes genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and
clinical data for the TCGA CRC cohort, data from other CRC tumor cohorts and cell lines, and exist—
ing knowledge on pathways and networks, giving a total of more than 17 million data points. The
portal provides features for data query, upload, visualization and integration. These features can be
flexibly combined to serve various needs of the users, maximizing the synergy among omics data,
human visualization and quantitative analysis. Using three case studies, we demonstrate that the
portal not only provides user—friendly data query and visualization but also enables efficient data
integration within a single omics data type, across multiple omics data types, and over biological
networks.

Availability and implementation: The NetGestalt CRC portal can be freely accessed at http://www.
netgestalt.org.

Technology advancements have enabled comprehensive character—
ization of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and
metabolomic changes in tumor specimens. A prime example is the
TCGA project’s generation of multiple types of omics data from
hundreds of human tumor specimens for each of the more than
20 selected tumor types.

Bridging the gap between data generation and investigators’ abil—
ity to retrieve and interpret the data is essential to fully realize the
biological and clinical value of the vast amount of omics data.

terms such as the cBioPortal for cancer genomics (Cerami et (11.,
2012) have been established. Moreover, the UCSC Cancer
Genomics Browser (Zhu et (11., 2009) enables simultaneous visual—
ization of various types of omics data within the context of genomic
sequence, providing an excellent platform for integrating genome—
anchored information.

Biological networks provide excellent functional contexts for
exploring omics data; however, node—link diagram—based network
visualization becomes inadequate as network size and data

complexity increase (Gehlenborg et 41]., 2010). Using CircleMaps,
the UCSC Interaction Browser allows simultaneous visualization of
multiple omics datasets within the context of gene interactions
(Wong et 41]., 2013). Although very useful, this approach cannot
scale up to large networks. Previously, we developed NetGestalt
(Shi et 41]., 2013) that exploits the inherent hierarchical modular
architecture of biological networks to achieve high scalability.
NetGestalt orders the nodes of a network along the horizontal di—
mension of a webpage based on the underlying hierarchical organ—
ization of the network. Visualization in the horizontal dimension
conveys the functional relationship between different nodes (i.e.
genes) as encoded in the network. The linear layout facilitates
scaling up to thousands of genes. Moreover, because it only uses one
dimension to display network nodes, node—related information from
different data sources can be rendered as ‘tracks’ along the vertical
dimension for visual comparison and integration. This unique ap—
proach makes NetGestalt an appropriate framework for the study of
multidimensional cancer omics data in the context of biological
networks.

Recent completion of the global proteomic characterization of
the TCGA CRC cohort (TCGA Research Network, 2012) resulted
in the first tumor dataset with complete molecular measurements at
DNA, RNA and protein levels (Zhang et 41]., 2014). In this article,
we describe the application of the NetGestalt framework, using
CRC as a paradigm, to provide a network—centric view of multidi—
mensional cancer omics data. We use three case studies to demon—
strate that the portal not only provides for easy data querying
and visualization but also enables efficient data integration within a
single omics data type, across multiple omics data types and over
biological networks.

2 Methods

2.1 Data architecture
As shown in Figure 1, experimental data in the portal are organized
on the basis of sample types, data types and data processing levels.
The portal also includes existing knowledge on pathways and net—
works. Details on data sources and data processing are provided in
Supplementary Methods.

2.1.1 Sample types

The portal includes data for both CRC tumors and cell lines. The
former were collected from TCGA and the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO), whereas the latter were from the Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia (CCLE) project (Barretina et 41]., 2012) and the
Achilles project (Cheung et 41]., 201 1).

2.1.2 Data types

For the TCGA tumor cohort, we collected (i) somatic mutation data
for 224 tumor samples; (ii) somatic copy number alteration (SCNA)
data for 257 tumor samples; (iii) DNA methylation data for 234
tumor samples and 42 normal samples; (iv) mRNA expression data
for 222 tumor samples and 22 normal samples; (v) protein expres—
sion data for 90 tumor samples and 30 normal samples; and (vi) all
available clinical data. Because patient survival data for the TCGA
cohort are very limited, we further collected microarray gene expres—
sion data from GEO for five CRC cohorts. These cohorts have a total
of 431 samples, with overall survival (OS) and disease—free survival
(DFS) information for 326 and 318 samples, respectively. For cell lines
from the CCLE project, we included (i) mRNA expression data for 61
CRC cell lines; (ii) copy number data for 58 CRC cell lines; (iii)

mutation data for 61 CRC cell lines; and (iv) drug response data for
23 CRC cell lines. From the Achilles project, we further collected
genes showing enhanced dependencies in the 18 CRC cell lines based
on short hairpin RNA screens of 11 194 genes in 102 cell lines.

2.1.3 Processing levels

Experimental data downloaded from various sources were processed
at four different levels. At Level 1, data for individual samples were
summarized at the gene level to generate gene—by—sample matrices.
At level 2, for selected sample attributes, appropriate statistical
analyses such as the Student’s t—test, Wilcoxon rank—sum test, Cox
regression or Spearman’s correlation test were performed based on
the matrices to generate test statistics, nominal P values, and False
Discovery Rates (FDRs) for individual genes. At Level 3, based on
pre—defined thresholds, such as FDR <0.01 and/or fold change >2,
significant genes were identified. At Level 4, data integration was
performed. As an example, survival analysis results for the five GEO
CRC cohorts were integrated to identify genes consistently corre—
lated with survival time in multiple cohorts. As another example,
correlations between SCNA and protein levels measured in the same
tumor cohort were computed for individual genes to identify SCNAs
that potentially drive protein abundance changes.

2.1.4 Knowledge

The portal includes three protein—protein interaction networks:
HPRD is based on the Human Protein Reference Database (Keshava
Prasad et (11., 2009), iRef is based on the iRef database (Turner
et (11., 2010) and iRef_HI expands the iRef network by further inte—
grating ~14000 interactions recently made available through an un—
biased human interactome project (http://interactome.dfci.harvard.
edu/H_sapiens/). We also included pathway data from Cancer Cell
Map (10 pathways), GO Biological Process (808 GO terms), GO
Cellular Component (231 GO terms), GO Molecular Function (383
GO terms), HumanCyc (267 pathways), KEGG (200 pathways),
NCI Pathway Interaction Database (PID, 223 pathways) and
Reactome (1108 pathways).

2.1.5 File formats

All data described earlier were processed to one of the standardized
data formats and stored on the web server. NetGestalt supports the
nsm format for serialized and modularized networks, the cot format
for composite continuous tracks (e.g. expression matrices), the cbt
format for composite binary tracks (e.g. mutation matrices), the set
format for single continuous tracks (e.g. fold changes), and the sbt
format for single binary tracks (e.g. significant genes). For composite
tracks containing multiple samples, sample annotations can be
stored in the tsi format. Detailed description of the file formats
can be found in the Supplementary Manual. As shown in Figure 1,
networks provide functional ‘views’ in NetGestalt, whereas all other
data are converted to ‘tracks’, which can be queried, visualized and
integrated using the analysis features in NetGestalt.

2.2 Data query and upload features

All data in the portal can be accessed through the menu bar located
at the top of the web page. Under the ‘View’ menu, users can select
one of the three network views (HPRD, iRef or iRef_HI) as the basis
for data visualization and analysis. User—specific networks can also
be uploaded through this menu. Under the ‘Track’ menu, users can
browse all 3356 system tracks or search for a specific system track.
All tracks in the current version of NetGestalt are summarized in
Supplementary Table S1. Users can also upload their own track files

in one of the NetGestalt file format or simply enter a list of gene
symbols to create a new track.

2.3 Visualization features

Visualization in the portal follows the basic visual design principles
summarized as the Visual Information Seeking Mantra
(Shneiderman, 1996): Overview first, zoom and filter, then details—
on—demand (Fig. 1).

2.3.1 Overview

Genes in a network are ordered in one dimension based on the
underlying hierarchical organization of the network, making it pos—
sible to provide an overview of data for all genes in a network, with
composite tracks visualized as heat maps, single continuous tracks
as bar charts, and single binary tracks as barcode plots. For a com—
posite track, samples annotations can be co—visualized as a compan—
ion heat map, which also enables interactive sorting of the samples
based on annotations of interest. For composite continuous and
single continuous tracks, visualization may be improved through
data transformation.

To provide a concise overview for the multidimensional omics
data for the TCGA tumor cohort, we created an ‘omics snapshot’
track that summarizes all tumor—related molecular alterations in five
sub—tracks corresponding to somatic mutations, SCNAs, epigenetic
alterations, and differential expression at mRNA and protein levels,
respectively (Fig. 2a). Similarly, a ‘clinical relevance snapshot’ track
was created with four sub—tracks indicating markers for DFS,
markers for OS, signature genes for the microsatellite instable (MSI)
versus microsatellite stable (MSS) comparison, and signature genes
for the stage IV versus stage I comparison, respectively. Each sub—
track was generated by meta—analysis of multiple independent stud—
ies when possible. Based on the cell line data, a ‘drug response snap—
shot’ track was generated with 24 sub—tracks each representing the
correlations between the sensitivity of the 23 cell lines to one of the
24 drugs and mRNA expression of individual genes across the cell
lines.

2.3.2 Zoom and filter

Because the one—dimensional layout of network nodes is created on
the basis of the hierarchical modular organization of the network, a
quick overview of one or multiple data tracks can often reveal net—
work modules or sub—networks with interesting patterns, e.g. mod—
ules enriched with mutated or differentially expressed genes.
Accordingly, users can easily zoom into the areas of interest. When
a pattern cannot be easily recognized by visual examination, net—
work analysis methods described in the ‘Integrative analysis fea—
tures’ section (see below) can be used. If a single gene of interest is
pre—specified, it is also possible to directly zoom to the gene. When
zoomed—in, users can also pan to left or right and adjust the zoom
level to explore the data.

Although the network—derived 1D layout of the genes provides a
convenient functional framework for data visualization, many im—
portant functional relationships between genes cannot be revealed in
such a layout due to the complexity of biological systems and the
multi—functional nature of the genes. We address this limitation by
the filtering feature associated with single binary tracks, through
which a subset of data for the genes in a single binary track can be
retrieved and visualized. In NetGestalt, single binary tracks can be
defined based on experimental data (e.g. recurrently mutated genes or
genes significantly correlated with survival time), existing knowledge
on pathways, or user provided gene lists. Moreover, through the

Fig. 2. Retrieving information for KRAS. (a) The Omics snapshot summarizes
the tumor-related somatic mutations, SCNAs, epigenetic alterations and dif-
ferential expression at mRNA and protein levels for all genes. For somatic
mutation, red represents significantly mutated genes and light red represents
genes mutated in at least 5% of the CRC samples; for SCNA, red/light red rep-
resent genes in the focal amplification regions and blue/light blue represent
genes in the focal deletion regions, with red/blue representing candidates
drivers; for epigenetic alteration, red represents epigenetically silenced
genes; for mRNA/protein expression, red and blue represent significantly
over- and under-expressed genes with fold change >2, whereas light red and
light blue represent significantly over- and under-expressed genes with fold
change <2. Grey represents missing data. (b) When zooming into the KRAS
gene, it can be seen that KRAS is significantly mutated in CRC and down
regulated at both mRNA and protein levels in tumors compared with normal
colon biopsies. Data for genes in the network neighborhood are visualized
simultaneously. (0) The proteomics data show that the KRAS protein abun-
dance is lower in tumors compared with normal controls; however, tumors
with mutant KRAS have higher KRAS abundance compared with those with-
out mutant KRAS. Red and blue represent relative over- and under-expres-
sion, respectively. (d) Sample-level mutation information for KRAS and genes

filtering feature associated with single continuous tracks, it is also pos—
sible to apply user—defined criteria to derive single binary tracks.

2.3.3 Details-on—demand

For all data tracks, after zooming into a network area with less than
a pre—specified number of genes (i.e. 500 in the current implementa—
tion), a node—link diagram can be used to visualize detailed inter—
action relationships between all genes in the area. For single binary
tracks, the node—link diagram option is also available for network
areas with less than a pre—specified number of present genes to visu—
alize detailed interaction relationships between present genes in the
area. Data in the single continuous and single binary tracks for indi—
vidual genes are used to determine node colors in the node—link

diagrams. In addition, two tracks can also be co—visualized in a
node—link diagram in which node and edge colors are determined by
data in one of the tracks, respectively.

As described earlier, data in the portal are processed at four dif—
ferent levels. Users can usually start from a higher—level summary
track, and when an interesting network area is located, correspond—
ing lower—level data can be retrieved to gain more detailed informa—
tion. For example, when a network area with enriched number of
mutated genes is located, the corresponding mutation matrix can be
retrieved to investigate mutation status for these genes in individual
samples.

2.4 Integrative analysis features
The portal enables data integration at three levels and provides vari—
ous features for each level of data integration.

First, comparable data generated at the same omics level from
multiple independent studies can be integrated. For example, mul—
tiple groups have performed gene expression profiling studies to
identify genes significantly correlated with patient survival time
(Jorissen et al. 2009; Reid et (11., 2009; Smith et (11., 2010; Staub
et (11., 2009). We used the order statistics method (Wang et (11.,
2013) to integrate data from these studies, and the pre—computed re—
sults are readily available as a track. Similarly, integrated tracks for
differential expression between stages I and IV tumors or between
MSI and MSS tumors in multiple gene expression studies have also
been pre—computed, respectively. In addition to retrieving pre—com—
puted results, users can also use the filtering feature to select genes
from individual studies and then use the Boolean operation feature
(i.e. interactive Venn diagram) to perform simple data integration
on the ﬂy.

Second, data generated at multiple omics levels can also be inte—
grated. The omics snapshot based on the multi—omics data from the
TCGA tumor cohort provides an easy way to achieve such integra—
tion by visual examination. Moreover, based on data from
the TCGA tumor cohort, correlation between SCNA level and
mRNA/protein abundance has been pre—computed for individual
genes, which provides a means for prioritizing genes in the SCNA re—
gions. Users can also combine the filtering and Boolean operation
features to perform multi—omics data integration on the ﬂy. For
example, genes that are epigenetically silenced and also down regu—
lated at protein level can be identified through such integration.
Similarly, genes that are mutated or deleted in CRC can also be
identified.

Moreover, experimental data can be integrated with network or
pathway information. Experimental data can be either an individual
omics dataset or an integrated dataset resulted from abovemen—
tioned methods. For network analysis, NetGestalt has implemented
a module—based approach and a direct neighborhood approach.
In the module—based approach, enrichment analysis is performed for
a single binary or a single continuous track against protein—protein
interaction network modules at all hierarchical levels based on the
Fisher’s exact test or the Kolmogorov—Smirnov test, respectively.
In addition to the network modules, enrichment analysis can also be
performed against the GO or pathway gene sets. In the direct neigh—
borhood approach, genes in a single binary track are considered
‘seeds’. For individual genes in the network, all direct neighbors are
identified and evaluated for the enrichment of the seeds using the
Fisher’s exact test. To prioritize the seed genes, the analysis can be
focused on only the seed genes. To expand seed genes to include
other potentially interesting genes, the analysis can be focused on
only the non—seed genes. When a single binary track contains 10 or

J.Zhu et aI.

 

fewer genes, NetGestalt allows easy retrieval of all direct neighbors
of the genes.

2.5 Software implementation

NetGestalt is developed using the Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript
and XML) technology with JavaScript on the client side and PHP/
Python/C++/R on the server side. A complete list of features imple—
mented in NetGestalt is provided in Supplementary Table S2. All
data described in this article can be accessed at http://www.netges—
talt.org. A detailed usage guide is available in the Supplementary
Manual.

3 Case studies

In this section, we use three case studies to illustrate some of the pos—
sible applications of the NetGestalt CRC portal.

3.1 Retrieving information for a gene

One simple usage of the portal is to retrieve information for a gene
of interest, and we will use KRAS, one of the best—studied proto—
oncogene in CRC, as an example. After retrieving the omics snap—
shot for visualization (Fig. 2a) and zooming into the KRAS gene
(Fig. 2b), we can immediately see that KRAS is significantly mutated
in CRC, does not have significant copy number or methylation
changes, and is down—regulated at both mRNA and protein levels in
tumors compared with normal colon biopsies. As KRAS is an onco—
gene, this is somewhat counterintuitive. To better understand the
KRAS protein expression pattern, corresponding proteomics data
can be retrieved and visualized. Although the KRAS protein abun—
dance is indeed lower in tumors compared with normal controls, it
is obvious that tumors with mutant KRAS have higher KRAS abun—
dance compared with those without mutant KRAS (Fig. 2c), suggest—
ing the dependence of CRC tumors on the mutant but not wild—type
KRAS protein. In addition to acquiring information for KRAS,
NetGestalt also allows a quick overview of information for genes in
this network neighborhood. Several other significantly mutated
genes, including BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA, reside in this neighbor—
hood (Fig. 2b), which suggest the functional importance of this net—
work neighborhood and also reinforces the critical role of KRAS in
colon cancer. Sample—level mutation information for these genes can
be further retrieved and visualized (Fig. 2d). Although many genes
are frequently mutated in the hypermutated tumors, only the above—
mentioned genes are frequently mutated in the non—hypermutated
tumors. Moreover, a node—link diagram depicting detailed inter—
action relationships between genes in the neighborhood can also be
created (Fig. 2e). Although many databases provide gene—centric
data retrieval, the portal enables unparalleled easy, intuitive, and
ﬂexible access to multi—omics data within a biological network
context.

3.2 Retrieving information for a gene set

Another common usage of the portal is to retrieve information for a
set of genes defined in a single binary track, and we will use the
WNT signaling pathway as an example. A search for ‘WNT’ in the
portal returned four WNT pathways in the Cancer Cell Map,
KEGG, PID and Reactome databases, respectively. Co—visualization
of these pathway annotations showed that the Reactome annotation
is clearly different from all the others (Fig. 3a). A Venn diagram
comparison of the remaining three annotations showed a moderate
overlap, with only 34 common genes out of the total of 292 genes
annotated by these three databases (Fig. 3b). This type of

and Reactome databases, respectively are visualized as four single binary
tracks. (b) A Venn diagram comparison of the WNT signaling pathways anno-
tated by the Cancer Cell Map, KEGG and PID databases identified 34 common
genes. (0) Among these common genes, 33 genes form a connected protein-
protein interaction network that covers the well-known components of the
WNT signaling pathway. The omics snapshot (d) and the CRC cell line specific
essential gene track (e) depict CRC related molecular alterations and CRC de-
pendency of these 34 genes

information, although very important to the users, cannot be easily
retrieved from other pathway databases or analysis tools. Among
the 34 common genes, 33 form a connected protein—protein inter—
action network that covers the well—known components of the WNT
signaling pathway (Fig. 3c). After adding other tracks, data for these
genes can be easily retrieved and visualized using the filtering fea—
ture. As shown in Figure 3d, both TCF7L2 and APC are mutated,
deleted, and under—expressed in CRC tissues. AXINZ is amplified
and over—expressed in CRC tissues; it also shows a CRC lineage—spe—
cific dependency based on cell line data from the Achilles project
(Fig. 3e). CTNNBI is mutated in CRC tissues and shows CRC lin—
eage—specific dependency (Fig. 3d and e). Molecular alterations for
other genes can also be easily spotted. Thus, NetGestalt provides a
convenient way to annotate gene sets based on multi—omics data.

3.3 Prioritizing epigenetically silenced genes

The TCGA CRC study identified hundreds of epigenetically silenced
genes. Here we use the portal to prioritize and interpret these epige—
netically silenced genes. After retrieving both epigenetically silenced
genes and genes significantly down—regulated at the protein level in
CRC, a Venn diagram analysis identified 15 epigenetically silenced
genes that were repressed at the protein level (Fig. 4a). Using the fil—
tering feature, an omics snapshot for the 15 genes was created
(Fig. 4b). As expected, most of these genes were also significantly
down—regulated at the mRNA level. Using AKAP12 as an example,
we illustrate how to use the portal to find evidence to support the
functional importance of the gene. AKAP12 resides in a network
module with 76 genes, and the GO biological process enrichment

Fig. 4. Prioritizing and interpreting epigenetically silenced genes. (a) Venn diagram analysis identified 15 epigenetically silenced genes that were also significantly

down-regulated at the protein level in CRC. (b) Using the filtering feature, an omics snapshot for the 15 genes was created. to) AKAP12 resides in a network mod-

ule with 76 genes, and the module is significantly enriched with cell-cell adhesion genes. (d) The omics snapshot revealed five significantly mutated genes in this
module. (e) The clinical relevance snapshot showed that higher mRNA level of AKAP12 was significantly associated with decreased 08 and DFS time. if) A de-
tailed view of the proteomics data showed that compared with normal colon tissue, AKAP12 is down-expressed in most tumor samples except for subtype C

tumors. (g) Non-random distribution of the 92 significantly mutated genes in the network. (h) These genes are significantly enriched in four network modules,

including the AKAP12 containing module. The four modules are colored in pink and mutated genes in these modules are colored in red. (i) The involvement
of AKAP12 in this module is primarily mediated through the interaction with CTNNB1. (i) All direct interaction partners of AKAP12

analysis showed that the module is significantly enriched with cell——
cell adhesion genes (26 out of the 76 genes, FDR: 4.48e—24, enrich—
ment ratio : 18.3) (Fig. 4c).

Notably, the omics snapshot revealed five significantly mutated
genes in the module (Fig. 4d). To test whether this module is signifi—
cantly enriched with mutated genes, we performed network module
enrichment analysis for the 92 significantly mutated genes (Fig. 4g),
and the AKAP12 containing module was one of four enriched mod—
ules (Fig. 4h, FDR:0.006, enrichment ratio:8.6). As shown in
Figure 4i, the involvement of AKAP12 in this module is mediated
through the interaction with CTNNB1. The portal also allows quick
identification and visualization of all direct interaction partners of
AKAP12, which includes other well—known cancer genes such as
EGFR and PRKCA (Fig. 4j). Network—based analysis thus suggests
potential importance of AKAP12 in cancer. The clinical snapshot
showed that higher mRNA level of AKAP12 was significantly

associated with decreased OS and DFS time (Fig. 4e). Because
AKAP12 is hypermethylated and under—expressed in CRC compared
with normal colon tissues, this was unexpected. A detailed view of
the proteomics data showed that compared with normal colon tis—
sue, AKAP12 is down—expressed in most tumor samples except for
subtype C tumors (Fig. 4f), which have been associated with epithe—
lial—mesenchymal transition and possibly poor outcome (Zhang
et (11., 2014). A literature review indicates that hypermethylation of
AKAP12 and accompanied under—expression of the gene has been
noted in CRC (Liu et (11., 2010; Mori et (11., 2006) as well as other
human cancers (Choi et (11., 2004; Flotho et (11., 2007; Heller et (11.,
2008; Jin et (11., 2008; Tessema et (11., 2008). It has been shown that
AKAP12 mRNA was under—expressed in 31 out of 45 (69%) colo—
rectal carcinoma tissues and methylation of AKAP12 promoter re—
gion was detected in 35 (78%) of these tissues (Liu et (11., 2010).
Similarly, we found that the AKAP12 protein was under—expressed

in most of the tumors in the TCGA cohort. However, our analysis
also reveals that AKAP12 under—expression is likely not involved in
the poor—prognosis subtype C tumors, a finding that may have an
important clinical implication.

4 Discussion

The NetGestalt CRC portal brings together a comprehensive collec—
tion of CRC—related omics data. It not only provides easy query and
visualization of the data but also enables efficient data integration
within a single omics data type, across multiple omics data types,
and over biological networks. Our case studies demonstrate the key
features that distinguish NetGestalt from other related tools.

Compared with typical network visualization tools, NetGestalt
allows multi—scale representation and navigation of the data and en—
ables simultaneous visualization of different types of data to facilitate
data integration. Network visualization and analysis tools such as
Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003), VisANT (Hu et al., 2009) and
Osprey (Breitkreutz et al., 2003) have already become indispensible
tools in systems biology studies. Nevertheless, node—link diagrams do
not scale well with increasing network size and data complexity.
First, when the number of nodes goes beyond a few hundreds,
neither individual nodes and edges nor the modular structure of the
network can be clearly visualized. Second, simultaneous visualization
of multiple datasets in a network is inevitably problematic because of
a lack of space. Efforts have been made to collapse all members of a
module into a singe ‘meta—node’ (Hu et al., 2009), extend the two—di—
mensional representation into three—dimension (Pavlopoulos et al.,
2008), use animation to visualize data from multiple conditions
(Shannon et al., 2003), use CircleMaps to represent data associated
with individual nodes (Wong et al., 2013) or arrange multiple ver—
sions of the same network in a grid (Barsky et al., 2008). Despite
enormous research efforts, it remains challenging to use networks as
a framework for the visualization and integrative analysis of large
and heterogeneous datasets. NetGestalt offers one solution to pro—
vide a network—centric view of multidimensional cancer omics data.

Although the NetGestalt interface shares many similarities with
that of the genome browsers, they are conceptually different and
complement each other. Genome browsers are effective in integrat—
ing genome—anchored information such as gene structure annotation
and copy number variation (Kent at al., 2002). Nevertheless, they
are not designed to reveal functional relationships among gene prod—
ucts (Nielsen et al., 2010). NetGestalt brings functionally related
genes together to facilitate the interpretation and integration of
multi—omics data within the context of biological networks.

Another unique aspect of NetGestalt is the enabling of seamless
connections among the data query, visualization, and integration
features, which can be used iteratively in different combinations to
serve the needs of the users, maximizing the synergy among omics
data, human visualization, and quantitative analysis. As a result, the
portal can be used for both hypothesis generation and hypothesis
testing, or a combination of both. Moreover, users can also upload
their own datasets to the system for integrative analysis.

The current version of the portal only includes three human pro—
tein—protein interaction networks. Genes not included in the net—
works are not included for visualization and analysis in the portal.
In the future, we will add functional association networks (e.g.
STRING, Szklarczyk et al., 2011) that do not require physical inter—
action in order to further improve gene coverage. Moreover, it
has been shown that tissue—specific networks are more functionally
relevant (Guan et al., 2012; Magger et al., 2012). We will consider
adding context—specific networks to the portal. Meanwhile, users

can analyze the datasets using their own networks, which can be
easily uploaded to the system.

Using CRC as a paradigm, we have demonstrated the power of
NetGestalt in facilitating easy access and interpretation of multidi—
mensional cancer omics data. A natural extension is to expand the
portal to cover data for other cancer types. Analysis across tumor
types, as demonstrated by the Pan—Cancer initiative (Cancer
Genome Atlas Research at al., 2013), has started to provide novel
biological and clinical insights to human cancer. A NetGestalt
pan—cancer portal will complement existing efforts within the
Pan—Cancer initiative to facilitate the discovery of commonalities,
differences and emergent themes across cancer types at gene,
pathway, and network levels.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Many protein—protein interactions are more complex than
can be accounted for by 1:1 binding models. However, biochemists
have few tools available to help them recognize and predict the
behaviors of these more complicated systems, making it difficult
to design experiments that distinguish between possible binding
models. MTBindingSim provides researchers with an environment
in which they can rapidly compare different models of binding for a
given scenario. It is written specifically with microtubule polymers in
mind, but many of its models apply equally well to any polymer or
any protein—protein interaction. MTBindingSim can thus both help in
training intuition about binding models and with experimental design.
Availability and implementation: MTBindingSim is implemented in
MATLAB and runs either within MATLAB (on Windows, Mac or Linux)
or as a binary without MATLAB (on Windows or Mac). The source
code (licensed under the GNU General Public License) and binaries
are freely available at http://mtbindingsim.googlecode.com.

1 INTRODUCTION

The investigation of protein—protein interactions is a critical issue
in biochemistry, and many different models have been proposed to
account for the various binding behaviors that have been observed.
This wide array of possible models makes it difﬁcult for both
students and researchers to predict the binding data expected
from these different models. This can make the interpretation of
experimental data for an interaction without an established model
particularly difﬁcult (e.g. Zhu et al., 2009). In addition, it is difﬁcult
to design experiments that can conclusively determine which model
is best if one does not have a solid understanding of the behaviors
expected from the different models.

We have written MTBindingSim to assist with these Challenges.
MTBindingSim provides researchers and students with an
environment in which they can easily and rapidly visualize protein—
protein interactions under a variety of models and experimental
designs. While MTBindingSim was written speciﬁcally with
microtubule (MT) binding proteins in mind, all models except one
apply to binding to any polymer, and four of the models can be used
in any protein binding system. We are conﬁdent that MTBindingSim
can therefore be useﬁil for understanding protein binding in a wide
variety of contexts, within both research and education.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

MTBindingSim is written in MATLAB and distributed under the
GNU General Public License. It can therefore run on any platform on
which MATLAB is supported, including Windows, Mac OS X and
Linux. We also provide installation ﬁles that enable MTBindingSim
to be run on both Windows and Mac OS X systems that do not have
MATLAB installed. MTBindingSim allows users to model predicted
binding data in a variety of situations, as described below.

2.1 Binding models

MTBindingSim allows users to simulate protein binding
curves for seven different binding models. For detailed
information on the mathematics used to calculate the binding
curves, see the MTBindingSim documentation, available at
http://mtbindingsim.googlecode.Com. We have chosen this set of
models because they include most of those that have been proposed
for MT binding proteins (Sandblad et (11., 2006; Zhu et al., 2009).

As is conventional in the MT ﬁeld, we treat the concentration of
polymerized tubulin dimers as the concentration of MT. All models
allow the user to set the binding ratio of a microtubule-associated
protein (MAP), symbolized by A, to MT. The binding ratio assumes
that each tubulin dimer is an available binding site for A and that
when the binding ratio of A to MT is not 1, a single bound A takes
up more or less than one binding site. A key aspect of the program
is that the user speciﬁes the values for all binding constants.

While Models 1—4 are described in terms of binding between
an arbitrary protein A and MT subunits, they are not limited to
MT binding and can be used to simulate interactions between
any arbitrary proteins A and B (simply replace MT by B in the
descriptions). Models 5 and 6 are limited to polymer systems. Model
7 alone is MT—speciﬁc. Additional information beyond these brief
descriptions is provided in the User Manual.

(1) First-order binding: this model calculates binding curves for
a simple binding interaction where protein A binds to MT
with Kd (dissociation constant) KAMT.

(2) Two independent binding sites: in this model, there are two
separate ﬁrst-order binding sites for A on each MT subunit,
each with its own Kd.

(3) MAPS bind MT-bound MAPS: this model assumes that when
one A is bound to the MT, a second A can bind the MT—bound A
without taking up another MT binding site. The user speciﬁes
the dissociation constants for the A-MT binding and the A-A
binding. This model simulates a situation where binding to
the MT opens up an A-A binding site on a bound A.

(4) Two MAPS bind MT-bound MAPS: this model is identical to
the one described above except that two As can bind to the
ﬁrst MT—bound A. Both A-A binding interactions have the
same dissociation constant.

(5) MAPS dimerize ( a polymer-Speciﬁc model): in this model,
A dimerizes, and both A and A-A can bind to the MT, but do
so with different dissociation constants.

(6) Pseudocooperativity (a polymer-Speciﬁc model )2 due to the
complexity of ﬁlamentous structures, cooperative binding
of protein A to MTs cannot be easily modeled by the
standard cooperative binding model. Given this, we have
implemented a pseudocooperativity model, in which the
binding of one A to any MT site creates an MT* site,
which has a dissociation constant for A of KAMM. This
model approximates a situation where protein binding causes
changes to the overall polymer structure, changing the binding
afﬁnity for subsequent proteins.

(7) Seam and lattice binding ( an MT-Speciﬁc model )2 this model
allows users to investigate the signiﬁcance of the fact that
the binding surface at the MT seam is different from that on
the rest of the lattice (Kikkawa et al., 1994; Sandblad et al.,
2006). In this model, protein A binds to the MT seam (1/ 13
of the MT surface) with a dissociation constant of KAS and
lattice (12/13 of the MT surface) with a dissociation constant
of K A L .

2.2 Types of experiments simulated

MTBindingSim allows users to simulate data from three different
kinds of experiments. The experimental methods are based on
data collected using cosedimentation assays, the most common
method of testing protein-MT binding (e.g. Ackman et al.,
2000; Zhu et al., 2009). However, the binding curves computed
by MTBindingSim will be valid for experiments using any
method of measuring protein binding, including surface plasmon
resonance, ﬂuorescence anisotropy and tryptophan ﬂuorescence.
The experimental methods and plotting options were chosen to
mimic common data collection and plotting practices in protein
binding experiments. MTBindingSim allows users to save the
generated graphs and data in a variety of image formats, including
.csv (data), PDF, Adobe Illustrator and JPEG (graphs). In the
descriptions below, it is assumed that an arbitrary protein A is binding
to MT subunits, but MT could symbolize any binding partner.

Vary [MT] : in this experiment, the concentration of the
MT—binding protein A is held constant and the concentration of MT is
varied. This is a ‘standard’ binding experiment. For this experimental
method, the y-axis of the graph is the fraction of A bound to MT,
and the user can choose to plot concentration of total MT or the
concentration of free MT on the x-axis. This experimental method
yields the familiar Langmuir binding isotherm.

Vary [A] : in this experiment, the concentration of MT is held
constant and the concentration of A is varied. The concentration of
A bound to MT is graphed on the y-axis, and the user determines
whether the x-axis is the concentration of free or total A. This method
of investigating binding is often used to determine the level at which
A will saturate the MT (Ackman et al., 2000). These data also can
be graphed as a Scatchard plot, which can be useﬁil because the
graph will be linear for a stande ﬁrst-order interaction and curved
if cooperativity or other non-ﬁrst-order interactions exist.

made in MTBindingSim and edited in Adobe Illustrator.

Competition: this experiment examines the binding of two
MT—binding proteins, A and B. The concentration of A and MT is
held constant and the concentration of B is varied. The fraction of
A bound to MT is graphed on the y-axis and the total concentration
of B is plotted on the x-axis. Both A and B are assumed to bind to
the MT using the ﬁrst-order model.

2.3 Examples

As a ﬁrst example of how MTBindingSim might be used, we present
here an investigation of the effect of dimerization on protein binding
to MT. Figure 1A shows binding curves for a protein where the
monomer binds to MT with a signiﬁcantly weaker afﬁnity than the
dimer. The curves generated by MTBindingSim demonstrate the
dramatic effect that even weak dimerization can have on protein
binding. This effect is relevant for experiments with GFP fusion
proteins because GFP has a weak dimerization afﬁnity of ~ 100 MM
(Tsien, 1998), which, as shown in Figure 1, can be enough to cause
a clear (and to many people, surprising) change in behavior. This
suggests that researchers should be cautious in drawing conclusions
from data collected with GFP-tagged proteins.

As a second example, more relevant in an educational context,
we use MTBindingSim to illustrate standard ﬁrst-order binding
behaviors. Figure 1B shows how binding curves shift with different
Kd values, while comparison of Figure 1C to Figure 1B shows how
the appearance of the curves (and the position of 50% saturation)
can change dramatically when binding is plotted as a function
of total ligand (C) instead of free ligand (B). It is important for
educators to highlight this behavior, because it frequently causes
misinterpretations in binding experiments.

3 CONCLUSION

We here introduce a program, MTBindingSim, which provides an
environment for the simulation and comparison of protein binding
curves. This program is an excellent resource for students learning

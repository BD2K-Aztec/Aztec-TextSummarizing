Abstract

Summary: JSpecies Web Server (JSpeciesWS) is a user—friendly online service for in silico calculat—
ing the extent of identity between two genomes, a parameter routinely used in the process of poly—
phasic microbial species circumscription. The service measures the average nucleotide identity
(ANI) based on BLAST+ (ANlb) and MUMmer (ANIm), as well as correlation indexes of tetra—
nucleotide signatures (Tetra). In addition, it provides a Tetra Correlation Search function, which
allows to rapidly compare selected genomes against a continuously updated reference database
with currently about 32000 published whole and draft genome sequences. For comparison, own
genomes can be uploaded and references can be selected from the JSpeciesWS reference data—
base. The service indicates whether two genomes share genomic identities above or below the
species embracing thresholds, and serves as a fast way to allocate unknown genomes in the frame
ofthe hitherto sequenced species.

Availability and implementation: JSpeciesWS is available at http://jspecies.ribohost.com/
jspeciesws.

1 Introduction

DNA-DNA-hybridization (DDH) measures the degree of genomic
similarity between two pools of DNA molecules. Despite that dis-
tinct DDH determination methods frequently lead to different re-
sults; since nearly 50 years it is considered as the gold standard for
species delineation (Rossellé—Méra and Amann, 2015). In times of
cost-efficient sequencing with scientists having easy access to thou-
sands of publicly available genome sequences, the species delinea-
tion based on user friendly computational pairwise genome
comparisons to determine overall genome relatedness indices

|OGRL (Chun and Rainey, 2014)| has emerged. This approach has
already been widely accepted by the scientific community (Colston
et (11., 2014; Li et (11., 2015; Luin et (11., 2014; Oren and Garrity,
2014) and specialized tools like the stand-alone software JSpecies
(Richter and Rossellé—Méra, 2009) or similar solutions (Meier—
Kolthoff et (11., 2013) have proven to provide valuable OGRI results.

Here we present the _)Species Web Server (JSpeciesWS) a web-
based implementation of the core features of the original JSpecies
software for easy user-access and extended functionality. It repre-
sents the latest development of _)Species in terms of usability;

flexibility, and efficiency. An online reference database of all pub—
lished whole and draft genomes (about 32 000) with pre—calculated
OGRI results has been added and can be searched in seconds based
on genome comparison using the new Tetra Correlation Search
(TCS) function.

2 Methods

JSpeciesWS has been implemented with the Google Web Toolkit
(http://www.gwtproject.org/) version 2.7.0 and uses a Twitter—
Bootstrap clone (https://github.com/gwtbootstrap3/gwtbootstrap3)
for the user interface elements. Imported sequences get validated by
using the FastaValidator version 1 (Waldmann et al., 2014).

2.1 Average nucleotide identity based on BLAST+

The average nucleotide identity based on BLAST+ (ANIb) calcula—
tion is implemented as described by Goris et al. (2007). In contrast
to the original JSpecies stand—alone implementation, the web server
uses BLAST version 2229+ (Camacho et al., 2009) instead of
BLAST version 2.2.26 (Altschul et al., 1997).

2.2 Average nucleotide identity based on MUMmer

For average nucleotide identity based on MUMmer (ANIm) calcula—
tion, the dnadiff script of the MUMmer tool version 3.0 (Kurtz
et al., 2004) is used instead of a self—written parser used by the ori—
ginal JSpecies stand—alone implementation.

2.3 Tetra—nucleotide signature correlation index

Tetra is an alignment—free parameter correlating with ANI, and im—
plemented in the same way as the original JSpecies stand—alone
(Richter and Rossellé-Méra, 2009).

2.4 Tetra Correlation Search

TCS is a new feature of JSpeciesWS that allows rapid comparisons
against the JSpeciesWS reference database, providing a list of the
most similar genomes based on their resulting Tetra—nucleotide sig—
nature correlation index.

2.5 Genomes reference database

The internal JSpeciesWS genome database resembles NCBI’s gen—
omic sequence data taken from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/
genbank and includes all primary submissions of assembled genome
sequences and their associated annotation data. Currently, more
than 32 000 prokaryotic genomes at different stages of finishing are
included. For each entry, taxonomic information is provided for the
field’s domain, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species.
Further contextual data extracted from the original entry (if avail—
able) include genome size, guanine—cytosine content, Gram staining,
shape, arrangement, endospores formation, motility, salinity, oxy—
gen, habitat and temperature range.

3 Usage

JSpeciesWS does not require user registration. By visiting the web—
site, a session is generated linked to a dedicated genome cart. The
genome cart can be filled with own genome uploads and/or genomes
can be added from the JSpeciesWS reference database. The cart (ses—
sion) expires automatically after a period of 14 days of inactivity (no

revisit based on session code provided) and all data will be deleted.
The limit of genomes per cart is currently set to 15.

Pairwise ANIb, ANIm or Tetra calculations can be performed
between all genomes in the cart (all vs all) or, alternatively, only one
genome of the cart can be selected for comparison against all other
genomes in the cart to reduce calculation time. In addition, a TCS
can be performed for each genome in the cart against the complete
JSpeciesWS reference database of all published whole and draft
genomes.

After starting an analysis, the status field is regularly updated
and the user is finally informed about a finished calculation by a
pop—up message. In addition, the user can provide an e—mail address
to become informed about the completion of the calculations. A all
versus all comparison of 15 genomes (210 calculations) takes on the
current system about 2h based on ANIb, 30min based on ANIm
and 10 min based on Tetra. All results can be revisited, exported for
further processing and shared among users.

4 Conclusion

Recent studies have shown that electronic (in silico) pairwise OGRI
can replace standard laboratory—based DDH in order to simplify,
and at the same time substantiate, this central aspect of prokaryotic
species delineation. In addition, OGRI allows taxonomists to
quickly verify the species affiliation of any public genome sequence
and to identify wrongly annotated submissions. JSpeciesWS will
help to further propagate this approach by providing fast and easy
access to the corresponding analyses and a comprehensive genomes
reference database.

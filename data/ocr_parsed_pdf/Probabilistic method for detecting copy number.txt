Probabilistic method for detecting CNV

 

divide the genome into bins and identify the CNVs by comparing
the number of reads mapped to each bin. The key idea in these
methods is that deletions/duplications will result in more/fewer
fetal reads within a window, and this difference can be identiﬁed
using statistical methods. Srinivasan et a]. (2013) use depth—of—
coverage computed in 1 Mb windows across the genome to iden—
tify CNVs that are typically >1 MB, though they do report dis—
covery of a 300 kb CNV. Nine of the 22 discovered CNVs in 11
patients were concordant with karyotyping results, with most
discrepancies being short (<1 Mb) CNVs. Importantly, they use
extremely short (25 bp) reads, allowing for larger number of frag—
ments at equal coverage depth. Chen et a]. (2013) use even larger
10 Mb windows, again considering only the number of fragments
mapped, and are able to successfully identify variants 9729 Mb
with only one false positive among six true positives in 1311 pa—
tients. Both methods utilize low coverage WGS of the plasma
chNA, while leveraging the large number of samples.

In this manuscript, we introduce a novel model for non—
invasive prenatal identiﬁcation of de novo CNVs with increased
sensitivity compared with methods published so far. Our method
combines three types of information within a uniﬁed probabilis—
tic model. First, our method takes advantage of the imbalance of
allelic ratios at SNP positions that are introduced by various
types of paternally and maternally inherited CNVs. Secondly,
following the work of Kitzman et a]. (2012), we use parental
genotypes to phase nearby SNPs, modelling their co—inheritance
(or recombination) and thus improving the signal—to—noise ratio.
Finally, we observed that allelic ratios poorly differentiate be—
tween certain types of CNVs: for example, as further described
below, a duplication of a paternally inherited allele results in
extremely similar allelic ratios to deletion of a maternally in—
herited one. We thus combine the allelic ratios with the depth—
of—coverage signal to better differentiate between such cases. Our
simulation results, based on in silico introduction of novel CNVs
into plasma samples with 13% fetal DNA concentration, dem—
onstrate a sensitivity of 90% for CNVs >400 kb (with 13 calls in
an unaffected genome), and 40% for 5&400 kb CNVs (with 108
calls in an unaffected genome).

2 METHODS

Our method models two types of signal from the data: (i) imbalance of
the allele distributions at SNP loci (discussed in Section 2.1) and (ii)
number of fragments sequenced from ~1 kb genomic regions (discussed
in Section 2.2). Though each of these is noisy, the two are (nearly) inde-
pendent (modulo number of reads overlapping the SNP position) vari-
ables and can be combined into a single generative model. For this
purpose, we use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), where we interpret
the allele counts at SNP loci as emissions, while the coverage is used as a
prior probability for each state (see Section 2.3).

For our method, we assume that we have phased haplotypes of both
parents, and deep sequencing data of chNA from maternal plasma. In
practice we used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for the parents,
with phasing based on 1000 Genomes data (see Section 3.1). All de novo
CNVs thus correspond to a particular parental haplotype duplication or
deletion event. Labelling the two maternal and paternal haplotypes as
M A, M B, P A, PB. For each inheritance patterninormal inheritance, ma-
ternal duplication, paternal duplication, maternal deletion, paternal dele-
tioniwe introduce a set of phased inheritance patterns that enumerates all
the possible conﬁgurations of fetal haplotypes corresponding to the

respective inheritance pattern. For example a duplication in the maternal
gamete will consist of one (or more) of six phased inheritance patterns:

MAMAPAv MAMBPAv MBMBPAv
MAMAPBv MAMBPBv MBMBPB

There are a total of 20 phased inheritance patterns (PP): six each for
maternal/paternal duplication, two each for maternal/paternal deletion
and four for normal inheritance). We refer to the number of alleles
(copy count) inherited by the fetus as |PP|. We use r to refer to the
percentage of chNA that is fetus-derived; this parameter is estimated
from positions in the genome where the parents are homozygous for
alternate alleles.

2.1 SNP allele distribution

For every SNP locus we observe a distribution of nucleotides in maternal
plasma reads. In this section we focus on calculating the probability of the
observation with respect to a phased inheritance pattern. Formally, we
observe the counts of the four nucleotides {1%, kg, kg, by} and compute
the probability of observing each of these from a particular phased in-
heritance pattern PP. Ideally, these counts should follow multinomial
distribution with the parameter vector (pA, pg , pg, pT). However we
have found that modelling them as independent Gaussians with variance
equal to the mean (as an approximation of the Poisson), makes the in-
ference of the inheritance pattern more robust to noise.
More formally,

Pl‘lkleAwMB: PA,PB; r; PP]~N(MX,MX) (1)

To compute the expected support MA. for X e {A,C,G,T}, we ﬁrst
adjust the mixture ratio r based on the expected number of fetal haplo-
types |PP|, as absence/presence of an additional fetal copy in the plasma
sample inﬂuences the local fetal mixture ratio. We accommodate this in-
ﬂuence of |PP| expected fetal haplotypes instead of regular two as follows:

J _ |PP| - r / 2
' T |PP| -r/2+(l — r) (2)
Then for each nucleotide X we compute the probability pl. of observing
a read supporting X. Such a read might have originated from multiple
haplotypes, including two maternal haplotypes and |PP| fetal haplotypes.
We can individually evaluate this probability for each haplotype and
subsequently sum them to obtain pl:

17,. = 2 [Mi equals X] - m,»(1 — r’)
ie(A,B}

+ 2D} equals X] -

For reads putatively coming from maternal portion of the chNA
sample, we correct for maternal CNVs by using the allele ratios m,- as
observed in maternal-only sequencing data. Additionally, to mitigate
noise we add pseudocount at (proportional to the genome-wide coverage)
to these counts.

at + #reads supporting M l» in maternal sample

 

(4)

m»:
l 2oz+ 2 #reads supporting Al]- in maternal sample

We thus obtain the expected probability distribution for each nucleo-
tide observed at this SNP locus.

To obtain the expected number of reads MA. supporting particular vari-
ant at this SNP locus, we have to multiply pl. by the number of reads
mapped,

MA. =17, - #mapped reads (5)

As we describe later, we use this probability distribution N01,. MA.)
that is conditional on phased pattern PP as the emission distribution for
each nucleotide in our HMM.

conditional on phased inheritance pattern as described above in
Section 2.1.

To incorporate the coverage information, for each SNP position, we
multiply the transition probabilities into the state by the copy number
priors obtained in Section 2.2. Speciﬁcally, each edge incoming to a state
is multiplied by the corresponding prior of inheriting that many haplo-
types, which are then normalized so that the sum of the probabilities
leaving each state is one.

The transition probabilities within an event type (e.g. maternal dupli-
cation) were set to 0.01, to reﬂect expected haplotype block lengths of
several hundred SNPs. Further, the transition probability for starting a
CNV was set to one in ten thousand SNP loci (0.0001) with length ex-
pected to span approximately one thousand SNPs (i.e. transition prob-
ability back to normal inheritance was set to 0.001).

2.4 CNV Simulation in silico

To evaluate the accuracy of our CNV discovery algorithm, we created
simulated datasets with CNVs of various sizes inserted into the sequenced
plasma. While previous approaches have used simple Poisson modelling
of the coverage of chNA for simulation purposes (Chen et al., 2013), we
propose a more elaborate model to more accurately model the extremely
uneven coverage that we observe in chNA samples (Fig. 1). Our simu-
lation performs the deletion or duplication of a particular fetal allele. We
need to resolve the haplotypes of every individual in the trio, to correctly
add or remove reads originating from a target haplotype of the CNV
event. Similarly to our detection method (described in Results, below), we
used Beagle 4 (Browning and Browning, 2013) with 1000 Genomes
Project reference haplotypes; however, we also use the fetal genome
sequenced after delivery, and utilize pedigree information to phase each
individual in the trio.

To simulate a duplication, of either maternal or paternal origin,
we used the parental DNA sequencing data from the family trio
dataset. First, we ﬁltered for reads mapping to the intended region
of duplication that also match the target haplotype of the parent ac-
cording to the parental phasing. In case of reads not uniquely mapping
to either of the two parental haplotypes, i.e. the read mapped to a
region without any heterozygous SNP locus, the read was selected
randomly with probability 0.5. Subsequently, the ﬁltered reads were
uniformly down-sampled according to fetal DNA mixture ratio and
the original plasma DOC in this region to match the expected number
of reads derived from a single fetal haplotype in plasma sequencing.
Resulting reads were then mixed together with original plasma reads to
create a plasma sample containing the desired duplication in the fetal
genome.

To simulate a deletion, we ﬁrst identified a fetal haplotype in-
herited from the parent of choice, which was to be deleted. We ﬁltered
the plasma sample removing reads coming from this target fetal haplo-
type. That is, each read mapped to the intended deletion region was
removed with probability of belonging to the fetus and also being
inherited from the intended parent. To ﬁnd this probability, we used
the phasing to check which maternal and fetal haplotypes match the
SNPs in the read. If none of the four haplotypes matched the read, we
removed the read with probability r/2 where r is the fetal DNA ad-
mixture ratio. If the fetal target haplotype matched the read, it was
removed with probability

r/2

Nm -(1 —r)/2+Nf-r/2 (9)

where 0<Nf 5 2 and 0 5 Nm 5 2 are respectively the number of fetal
and maternal haplotypes that matched the read.

We also simulated plasma datasets with decreased fetal DNA mixture
ratio. To achieve a desired down-rated admixture ratio r’ in our plasma
sample, we had to remove appropriate number of reads coming from the
fetal DNA. First, we have computed the appropriate fraction of

fetal-origin reads, w.r.t. original admixture ratio r, to be removed from
the plasma as
1 — r r’
1 _ r/

me] = 1 —

Similarly to simulation of a deletion, we have then ﬁltered the plasma
reads for reads originating from the fetal genome. Since this cannot
be decided without ambiguity, we estimated the corresponding probabil-
ity Pfi

where Nf and Nm, as above, are the number of fetal and maternal haplo-
types that match SNP alleles of the read. Thus a read was then removed
with probability equal to

3 RESULTS

3.1 Datasets and processing

In our experiments, we used WGS data of two motherifatheri
child trios 11 (Table 1), and G1, published by Kitzman et a].
(2012). In our experiments, we mainly used the first trio 11
with 13% fetal admixture in obtained plasma. For maternal,
paternal and plasma datasets, the reads were aligned to the
th9 genome using BWA. We genotyped both the parents
using Samtools and chtools. To improve the precision of geno—
typing, we only consider variants at positions previously identi—
fied as variable within the 1000 Genomes Project. Subsequently
we phased the haplotypes using Beagle 4 (Browning and
Browning, 2013) with reference haplotype panels from 1000
Genomes Project.

3.2 Evaluation

We simulated 360 CNVs in 11 plasma to evaluate our methods
recall, while G1 plasma sample served as a reference in DOC—
based CNV estimation as described in Section 2.2. For each test
case, we picked a random position in chromosome 1, outside
annotated centromere and telomeres regions, to place the simu—
lated CNV. Our simulation methods are described in detail in
Section 2.4. We then ran our algorithm on a genomic window
starting 20 Mb before the simulated CNV and ending 20 Mb
after the CNV. The results are shown in Table 2. We acknow—
ledge a CNV as correctly called if CNV predictions of the same
type span at least 50% of it, while precision is computed as the
fraction of correct CNV calls over all calls of that category. To

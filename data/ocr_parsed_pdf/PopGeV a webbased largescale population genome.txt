Abstract

Motivation: The development of high—throughput sequencing technology has made it possible for
more and more researchers to use population sequencing data to mine genes associated with spe—
cific traits. However, the massive amounts of sequencing data have also brought new challenges
to the researchers. The question of how to browse population genomic data in an easy and intuitive
manner must be addressed. Web—based genome browsers allow user to conveniently view the re—
sults of genomic analyses, but heavy usage can reduce the response speed of the webpage, which
limits its usefulness in the display of large—scale genome data. IndexedDB technology is a good so—
lution to this problem; it supports web browsers and so creates local databases. In this way, data
can be read from the local storage, achieving a smooth display of population genomic data.
Results: PopGeV has the following characteristics. First, it uses a new encoding method for com—
pression of population SNP and INDEL data. IndexedDB technology is used to download the results
to local storage so that users can browse the results smoothly even when the network traffic is
heavy. Second, PopGeV identify similar genomic regions between two individuals based on SNP
data. Population diversity indexes are calculated when comparing two populations. Third, user
defined annotation information can be integrated for user—friendly mining of gene functions.
Simulation shows that PopGeV can smoothly display analysis results of population genome con—
taining over 500 individuals with 2 millions SNP data.

Availability and implementation: PopGeV is available at www.soyomics.com/popgev/

efficient algorithms are needed to extract meaningful results from
population sequencing data. Second, user—friendly visualization
tools for the results of genomic analysis would be of great use to

searchers are using population resequencing technology to study
gene function and the evolution of species. Increases in the quantity
of data collected in genomic studies have also posed great challenges

biology researchers. Currently, several different genome visualiza—
tion tools have been developed to address different specific needs,
such as stand—alone program (Fiume et (11., 2012; Robinson et (11.,

2011) and web—based browsers (Kent et (11., 2002; Kumagai et (11.,
2013; Skinner et (11., 2009). As the quantity of genomic data col—
lected in studies increases, population genome analysis tools are
becoming more and more important. Considering the computation
capacity, more and more users have chosen to perform data analysis
on the cloud server, and the results of analysis can be returned in
HTML format. This suggests web—based visualization tools may be—
come even more popular in the future.

When using web—based browsers to display the results of popula—
tion genome analyses, two issues must be resolved. First, the large
amount of data transmitted will produce corresponding delays; se—
cond, web browsers are not as ﬂexible as stand—alone programs in
terms of user interaction. Here, HTML5 technology was used to de—
velop a visualization tools for population genome analysis. Canvas
and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) are used as the primary display
technology, SVG is a way to achieve vector image display, making
the visualization clearer than ever and improving the interactive per—
formance. The IndexedDB local database technology reduces the
number of interactions between the webpage and the server, so that
the users can smoothly browse the analysis results. Simulation
shows that this software can display genomic variants of more than
500 soybean genomes smoothly.

In terms of software features, in addition to basic functions such
as displaying the SNP and INDEL variation in each individual,
PopGeV also identify recombination sites within the population and
analyze the genetic relationships between individuals. Population di—
versity indexes such as Fst, Tajima’s D are calculated, and these can
be used to show difference between two populations.

2 Methods

PopGeV places all data and programs on the server side; the user
accesses the results of analysis through web browsers. On the server
side, an APACHE2 webserver with MySQL database support must
be installed. On the client end, only a web browser that supports
HTML5 needs to be installed. In order to improve the performance,
the server uses Apache Zip for compression of webpage; the use of
Zip compression can greatly reduce the number of bytes in network
transmission, significantly increasing speed of loading webpages.
When user visits the website first time, the genomic data on web ser—
ver will be downloaded to local disk, browser uses IndexedDB tech—
nology for data storage. When the user opens the page again,
IndexedDB storage data are used to quickly restore the last oper—
ation status. In this way, PopGeV uses storage and display methods
different from those of currently available genome browsers. This
renders browsing of population genome data very smooth.

3 Results
3.1 SNP and IDNEL display

By reading the population variation files in VCF file format and cor—
responding annotation files, PopGeV can extract SNP and INDEL
details and display them on a ﬂoating window. In order to reduce
the amount of data transmitted, PopGeV uses hexadecimal encoding
to compress the genotype of each SNP locus in the population.
PopGeV can also read the annotation results generated by
ANNOVAR (Wang et (11., 2010), and use different colors to mark
the SNP and INDEL variations. When the user places the mouse
over an SNP, a ﬂoating window appears showing the details of that
variation.

3.2 Population comparisons

For population comparisons, the users usually want to know
whether different individuals and populations are the same or simi—
lar at which genomic regions on the whole—genome scale. Here, the
variation block (VB) algorithm proposed by Kim et al. (2014) was
used to determine recombination blocks (RCB). Variation block can
be used to analyze the genomic differences between individuals and
between sub—populations, and to evaluate transitive relationships be—
tween genetic regions in genealogical analysis. PopGeV can also
measure the differences between two populations using indicators
such as Fst, Pi and Tajima’s D as shown in Figure 1. Combining
these indicators and information of recombination regions, the dif—
ferences between population genomes can be clearly identified.

3.3 Annotations

Researchers often use population SNP data and traits to perform
genome—wide association studies in order to identify SNP loci associ—
ated with traits. PopGeV uses Manhattan plots to show GWAS re—
sults. Gene annotation files are in the format used by public
databases such as Phytozome (Goodstein et (11., 2012). PopGeV can
also display customized information, such as QTL information and
series of genes involved in a particular pathway. This customized in—
formation will help to accurately locate genes associated with traits.

3.4 Performance

To assess the software’s processing capabilities, data on 500 soy—
bean genomes, each containing 2 millions SNP and INDEL data,
were simulated. When users visit the website first time, it will cost
several minutes to retrieve data from web server. However, when
users visit the website again, the webpage loading time will be less
than one second even there are over 500 genomes.

4 Conclusion

The rapid growth of the amount of sequencing data produced by
genomic studies has raised challenges for data analysis and visualiza—
tion techniques. PopGeV uses the HTML5 IndexDB technology to
store data locally. In this way, it exploits the convenience of a web
browser and prevents frequent network communications, producing
a smooth display of massive quantities of genetic data. This software

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Inferring large transcriptional networks using mutual
information has been shown to be effective in several experimental
setup. Unfortunately, this approach has two main drawbacks:
(i) several mutual information estimators are prone to biases and
(ii) available software still has large computational costs when
processing thousand of genes.

Results: Here, we present parmigene (PARallel Mutual Information
estimation for GEne NEtwork reconstruction), an R package that tries
to fill the above gaps. lt implements a mutual information estimator
based on k-nearest neighbor distances that is minimally biased with
respect to the other methods and uses a parallel computing paradigm
to reconstruct gene regulatory networks. We test parmigene on
in silico and real data. We show that parmigene gives more precise
results than existing softwares with strikingly less computational
costs.

Availability and Implementation: The parmigene package is
available on the CRAN network at http://cran.r-project.org/web/
packages/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is currently one of
the most challenging task in systems biology. Several approaches
have been proposed to reconstruct GRNs using experimental data
(paradigm of reverse engineering approach) such as Bayesian
Networks (BN) (Friedman, 2004), Relevance Networks (RN), (Butte
et (11., 2000) and Graphical Gaussian Models (GGM) (Schafer and
Strimmer, 2005); see Werhli et al. (2006) for a comparative review.
While BN and GGM should be able to distinguish between direct and
indirect edges, RN does not. However, BN and GGM hardly work in
the case of thousands of genes and with a small number of replicates,
while RN have the ability to deal with them. The seminal paper of
Basso et al. (2005) extends RN introducing an algorithm based on
the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) for removing indirect edges.
Their approach, called ARACNE, has been successfully applied to
reconstruct the subnetwork of the MYC gene in human B cells.
At the same time, other methodologies have been proposed to
remove indirect edges: the CLR and the MRNET algorithms; for
additional details, see Meyer et a1. (2008). Although successfully

applied in the reconstruction of GRNs, RN based on MI estimation
are still affected by two major drawbacks: (i) some MI estimators
are biased (see Supplementary Material for details) and (ii) even if
RN computational cost is comparatively lower than that of BN and
GGM, the time required to reconstruct the GRN of several thousand
genes is still extremely large.

Here, we present parmigene (PARallel Mutual Information
calculation for GEne NEtwork reconstruction) a novel fast and
parallel R package that (i) performs network inference implementing
a minimally biased MI estimator, following Kraskov’s algorithm
(hereafter knnmi) (Kraskov et (11., 2004) based on k-nearest neighbor
distances, and (ii) uses OpenMP to implement a parallel GRN
reconstruction with a strikingly fast run times. In the following,
we report (i) the bias obtained by knnmi compared with the other
MI estimators, (ii) the precision obtained by parmigene in the
reconstruction of the MYC subnetwork using real data (Basso et (11.,
2005) and (iii) the computational costs for GRN reconstruction.

2 RESULTS

Bias: MI bias has been estimated for variables with low and
with perfect non-linear associations. We compare knnmi (from
parmigene), MI based on kernel density estimator [implemented in
KDEMI, Qiu et a1. (2009)] and variable discretizations implemented
in Bioconductor packages bioDist and mine! (Meyer et (11., 2008)
(the shrinkage entropy estimator, the Miller-Madow and the
Schurmann-Grassberger estimators, hereafter called shrink, mm and
sg). For additional details see Supplementary Material. Figure 1
shows the bias distributions, while Supplementary Table S1 reports
the average biases. parmigene with knnmi shows the lowest bias.
Lower ks seem to perform better in both scenarios; in the following,
we will thus report only the results of parmigene with k: 3.

Precision: The impact of the MI estimation on GRN
reconstruction has been veriﬁed using real data on human B cells
(GEO ID GSE2350) (Basso et (11., 2005). The precision has been
estimated using the subnetwork generated by the hub gene MYC
for which several true interactors are known. Margolin et al.
(2006) proposed the ARACNE algorithm with the DPI implemented
using a multiplicative tolerance (1'). miner implements only an
additive tolerance (8) that gives worse levels of precision (Table 2).
parmigene implements both alternatives. Table 1 reports precision
and rank score (normalized average rank of true positives); values
closer to 1 represent the best results (see Supplementary Material
for details).

The ARACNE inference method with the multiplicative tolerance
gives the highest precision. Furthermore, parmigene always

outperforms the other estimators either for precision or for rank
position.

Computational time: we tested the time required (i) to estimate
MI and (ii) to infer GRNs with increasing number of genes. Table 2
shows the results. In the case of large-scale experiments (the entire
gene expression matrix), parmigene computational time is strikingly
better than those of exiting methods; it is 12 times faster in the
MI estimation and 1.3 and 3.5 times faster, respectively, in the
ARACNE and MRNET algorithms. Using parallel computations

with a quad-core system, parmigene is 50 times faster than other
methods for MI estimation.

3 CONCLUSION

The MI estimator implemented in parmigene gives almost unbiased
results and, more importantly, more precise results on real data. In
addition, parmigene has strikingly fast execution times.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput screening is a powerful technology
principally used by pharmaceutical industries allowing the
identification of molecules of interest within large libraries. Originally
target based, cellular assays provide a way to test compounds
(or other biological material such as small interfering RNA) in a
more physiologically realistic in vitro environment. High-content
screening (HCS) platforms are now available at lower cost, giving
the opportunity for universities or research institutes to access
those technologies for research purposes. However, the amount
of information extracted from each experiment is multiplexed and
hence difficult to handle. In such context, there is an important
need for an easy-to-use, but still powerful software able to manage
multidimensional screening data by performing adapted quality
control and classification. HCS-analyzer includes: a user-friendly
interface specifically dedicated to HCS readouts, an automated
approach to identify systematic errors potentially occurring during
screening and a set of tools to classify, cluster and identify
phenotypes of interest among large and multivariate data.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-content screening (HCS) can be seen as an extension of high-
throughput screening when multiplexing readout. This technology
usually relies on complex biological systems such as cells.
Combined with novel automated imaging platforms, this technology
currently allows acquisition of a huge amount of experimental
data. Followed by image analysis, this approach performs the
extraction of high-dimensional signatures called phenotypes. Here
we propose an open source front end interface dedicated to
analyze high-dimensional data generated during HCS campaigns.
We embedded Weka [Hall et al. (2009)], Alglib (http://www.
alglib.net/) and Accord (http://accord-net.origo.ethz.ch) open source
scientiﬁc libraries and created a link to the KEGG database soap
server (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg). In a very easy and efﬁcient way,

the users can import screening datasets, visualize them, evaluate and
correct potential biases (edge effect, dispensing effect, etc.), Cluster
and Classify the data, all in a supervised or unsupervised mode. In
the case of siRNA screening, gene and pathway information can
be extracted, as well as pathways frequency. In addition, one can
export the results and generate a report including tables, graphs and
annotated images. Thus, our application is well suited for analysis
of complex HCS data. This method can be used to ﬁlrther develop
high-level plugins, taking advantage of statistical and mathematical
toolboxes which can be shared within the community.

2 FEATURES

HCS-Analyzer has been designed to follow a regular screening
analysis pipeline. The software provides six distinct steps: load
and display, data quality control, dimensionality reduction, data
normalization, Classiﬁcation or Clustering, and lastly, export results
(Fig. l). Importing data loads commonly used ﬁle formats such
as comma-separated values .CSV, .mtr [Makarenkov et al. (2006)],
and regular .txt ﬁles (Supplementary Figs. 51—53). The users can
select different parameters they want to load and visualize. Current
Plate displays the selected array of data. In this mode, the users
can design the assay by selecting controls and deﬁning Classes (e.g.
for a supervised Classiﬁcation). Dimensionality Reduction performs
feature selection. Two approaches are available: supervised, where
the reduced dimensions are those separating the most efﬁciently
deﬁned Classes (depending on criteria); or unsupervised, where only
one Class is required. In the context of phenotypic screening, the
feature selection represents not only a pre-process for Classiﬁcation
but may also lead to a better understanding of the biological
mechanism(s) of action involved. Systematic Error Identiﬁcation
and Correction achieves an automated quality evaluation on the
active plates. A survey of existing methods can be found in
Dragiev et al. (2011). We implemented here a novel approach to
automatically identify systematic errors each plate is potentially
subjected to. The algorithm is split into two distinct steps. The ﬁrst
one performs an automated uni-dimensional K-Means Clustering
based on each descriptor readout.

For this purpose, a signature related to the plate geometry is
associated to each well previously Clustered. Typically, this signature
includes distance to the edges, distance to the center, column index
and row index. In a normal case, those parameters should not
be inﬂuenced by any of the Clustering methods. Finally, a C45
Classiﬁer learning step is performed on those data. If successful, the
tree is automatically analyzed to provide the user a comprehensive
feedback identifying the systematic error. Two correction methods

Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of HCS-Analyzer features. HCS-Analyzer provides a user-friendly way for designing screening plates and for applying iteratively

all the regular screening processes. For siRNA screening. the application is also linked to the KEGG database. allowing automated pathway analysis. A special
effort has been made when designing the import and export controls to make these steps as ﬂexible as possible. Graphs allow the assessment of the screening

quality such as Z-factors evolution during the screening. A new algorithm has been developed to automatically identify systematic errors. After phenotype
identiﬁcation. the user can check the readout distribution using various scatter points or graphs

are proposed, the B-score [Brideau et al. (2003)] and the diffusion-
based model [Carralot et al. (2012)]. Plates can also be rejected
based on Z-score in one dimension.

Normalization normalizes the readouts of the different plates to
reach a data consistency required for hit identiﬁcation. This step is
not mandatory with some classiﬁcation approaches, typically when
the learning step is performed plate by plate.

Classiﬁcation and Clustering automatically classiﬁes and
identiﬁes the phenotype(s) of interest in a multivariate way. The
classiﬁcation can be operated in a supervised (Support vector
machine, Neural network, K-nearest neighbors, random forest)
or unsupervised manner (K-Means, Expectation maximization,
Hierarchical). The clustering and classiﬁcation automatically
updates the classes, and if a tree-based algorithm has been chosen,
the graph can be displayed and exported.

Report Export generates a complete report of most of the
performed operations as well as a description of the screening
properties.

Finally, the application also includes a module to generate
artiﬁcial realistic multidimensional screening data [Kwan and
Birmingham (2010)], allowing the validation of additionally
developed algorithms.

3 CONCLUSION

The stand-alone software presented here aims to simplify the
process of correcting and analyzing multivariate screening datasets.
The ﬁill C# source code is available as well as a plugin sample
(Supplementary Fig. S4), allowing the user to adapt or to extend
the currently provided version of the application. A tutorial as well
as visual documentation can be downloaded at the same URL.

Further development of the application is expected to adapt the
software to evolving community requirements.

ABSTRACT

Summary: To reveal how the polycomb repressive—deubiquitinase
(PR—DUB) complex controls substrate selection specificity, we
undertook a detailed computational sequence analysis of its
components: additional sex combs like 1 (ASXL1) and BRCA1-
associated protein 1 (BAP1) proteins. This led to the discovery of
two previously unrecognized domains in ASXL1: a forkhead (winged-
helix) DNA-binding domain and a deubiquitinase adaptor domain
shared with two regulators of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase
37 (Uch37), namely adhesion regulating molecule 1 (ADRM1) and
nuclearfactor related to kappaB (NFRKB). Our analysis demonstrates
a common ancestry for BAP1 and Uch37 regulators in PR—DUB,
INO80 chromatin remodelling and proteosome complexes.

1 INTRODUCTION

BRCAl-associated protein 1 (BAP1) and ubiquitin carboxyl-
terminal hydrolase 37 (Uch37) (also known as UCHLS) are two
deubiquitinating proteases (DUBs) from the same peptidase family
that share a high degree of sequence similarity not only in their
catalytic ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase (UCH) domain but
also in an additional conserved carboxy-terminal region, previously
called the Uch37-like domain (ULD) (Misaghi et (11., 2009; Yao
et (11., 2006).

The controlled removal of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins
by DUBs is required in diverse cellular processes. The catalytic
domains of DUBs often require adapter domains to control the
speciﬁcity of substrate selection and thus to avoid cleavage of
inappropriate substrates (Komander et (11., 2009).

The human PR—DUB complex contains BAP1 and additional sex
combs like 1 (ASXL1). The PR—DUB complex represses polycomb
group target genes by removing monoubiquitin from histone H2A
in nucleosomes. Recently, it was found that the ASXL1 N-terminal
region (residues 2—365) is essential for its interaction with BAP1,
although the domains responsible for this interaction have been
determined in neither ASXL1 nor BAP1 protein sequences (Bott
et (11., 2011; Scheuermann et (11., 2010).

The PR—DUB complex has increasingly attracted medical interest
as somatic mutations in ASXL1 frequently occur in different

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

myelodysplastic syndromes (Bejar et (11., 2011; Boultwood et (11.,
2010; Carbuccia et (11., 2009; Gelsi-Boyer et (11., 2009; Hellstrom-
Lindberg, 2010). ASXL1 mutations have been also associated
with glioblastoma, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, cervical and
colon cancer (Bell et (11., 2011; McLendon et (11., 2008; Scotto et (11.,
2008; Williams et (11., 2010).

De nova nonsense mutations in human ASXL1 have also been
recently associated with Bohring—Opitz syndrome (also known as
Oberklaid—Danks or C-like syndromes), characterized by severe
intellectual disability, distinctive facial features and multiple
congenital malformations (Hoischen et (11., 2011).

Human ASXL1 belongs to a family of three vertebrate paralogues
(Fisher et (11., 2003, 2006; Katoh and Katoh, 2003, 2004) and it
is orthologous to Drosophila Asx (additional sex combs), whose
product is required for long-term repression of HOX genes during
development and whose mutants enhance homeotic phenotypes of
both polycomb and trithorax mutations (Breen and Duncan, 1986;
Milne et (11., 1999; Sinclair et (11., 1992). Mouse ASXL1 is required
for normal hematopoiesis and its knockout results in simultaneous
anterior and posterior transformations of the axial skeleton (Fisher
et (11., 2010a, b).

In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that ASXL1 has a
genuine transcription factor role by regulating retinoic acid receptors
and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (Cho et (11., 2006;
Lee et (11., 2010; Park et (11., 2011). ASX proteins have been
previously reported to contain two evolutionarily conserved regions
in metazoa, from ﬂy to humans: a region termed the ASX homology
(ASXH) domain and a C-terminal plant homeo domain (PHD) zinc
ﬁnger (Fisher et (11., 2003, 2006).

However, with the exception of its C-terminal PHD domain,
signiﬁcant sequence similarity was not detected with any other
known protein domain. In order to trace its evolutionary history and
to identify ﬁinctional domains, we embarked on a computational
protein sequence analysis of the ASX protein family.

2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

2.1 Computational protein sequence analysis.
The DEUBiquitinase ADaptor domain

Our iterative proﬁle-based database searches identiﬁed previously
unreported homologues of ASXL1 in fungi and land plants.
Animal ASX HMMer3 (Finn et (11., 2011) proﬁle searches
(based on Supplementary Figure 51 multiple sequence alignment
corresponding to the ASXH conserved region) revealed ASX
homologues in fungi, identifying the Aspergillus ﬁ1migatus
(UniProt:Q4WDB3_ASPFU) sequence with an E-value (HMMer3-
best ﬁrst domain) of 3.5 X 10—4.

Experimentally determined interactions are shown with brown arrows corresponding to: A) An ASXL1 N-terminal region (amino acids 2 to 365) interacts with
full length BAP1 (Scheuermann at (11., 2010; Bott at (11., 2011); B) The thnl3/ADRM l ULD-interacting region was localised to its second domain (amino
acids 278-391), here termed its DEUBAD domain (Hamazaki at (11., 2006; Yao at (11., 2006; Qiu at (11., 2006; Chen et (11., 2010); and C) The Uch37 ULD-
interacting region of NFRKB was localised to its ﬁrst 465 residues (Yao at (11., 2008). Summary of the experimental evidences supporting each interaction:
Scheuermann at (11., 2010: Reconstituted complex in humans and Afﬁnity Capture-Western for D. melanogaster orthologs (ASX and Calypso). Bott at (11.,
2011: Coimmunoprecipitation. Hamazaki at (11., 2006: Afﬁnity Capture-Western and reconstituted complexes. Yao at (11., 2006: Yeast two-hybrid conﬁrmed by
Afﬁnity Capture-Western and reconstituted complexes. Qiu at (11., 2006: Afﬁnity Capture-Western. Chen et (11., 2010: Intermolecular NOE (Nuclear Overhauser
Effect) interactions. Yao at (11., 2008: Anti tag coimmunoprecipitation and reconstituted complexes. Purple arrows indicate predicted interactions between

DEUBAD domains and C-terminal ULDs in BAP1 and Uch37 DUBs.

These approaches, however, failed to identify potential ASX
orthologues in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans or
in yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces
pombe). A proﬁle derived from animal and fungal ASX sequences
identiﬁed the Arabidopsis thaliana subfamily IV of GATA zinc
ﬁngers (Manﬁeld et (11., 2007): GATA27 (Tair:At5g47140, UniProt:
Q5PP38) and GATA26 (Tair:At4g17570, UniProt: Q8W4H1) with
E-values of 1.6 X 10—4 and 2.3 X 10—4, respectively.

Consistent with the conservation of the Polycomb H2A
ubiquitination machinery in plants (Bratzel et (11., 2010; Sanchez-
Pulido et (11., 2008), the ﬁnding of ASX and BAP1 homologues
in Arabidopsis suggests that the histone H2A deubiquitination
machinery (PR—DUB complex) could also be conserved between
plants and animals.

During a search for more remote evolutionary relationships,
we were surprised to ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant similarities
with ASXL1 for two further human proteins. HMMer3 proﬁle
searches using the ASX family proﬁle (corresponding to
Supplementary Figure S1 multiple sequence alignment marked with

the red bar) revealed the arthropod Pediculus humanus (UniProt:
EOVM25_PEDHC) sequence (which is a known orthologue of
the human NFRKB protein) with an E-value of 0.0073. The
ASX/NFRKB proﬁle (based on Supplementary Figure S1 multiple
sequence alignment marked with the red and yellow bars) localized
the Trichoplax adhaerens (UniProt: B3S476_TRIAD) sequence (a
known orthologue of the human ADRMl protein) with an E-value
of 0.0067. In addition, proﬁle-versus-proﬁle comparisons (using
HHpred) (Soding et (11., 2005) conﬁrm the previously described
evidences of sequence similarity among these families: the proﬁle
of the ASX family identiﬁed the NFRKB and ADRMl families
with E-values of 2 X 10—7 and 5 X 10—6, respectively. Statistically
signiﬁcant E-values of sequence similarity connected these human
ASXL1,2,3, NFRKB and ADRMl proteins and reciprocal searches
produced convergent results; no further human homologues were
identiﬁed.

NFRKB is a subunit of the INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex
(Conaway and Conaway, 2009; Papamichos-Chronakis et (11 ., 2011;
Yao et (11., 2008). The region of NFRKB that we observe to

Common ancestry for BAP1 and Uch37 regulators

 

be homologous to ASXL1 is located within a region previously
described as binding the C-terminal Uch37 ULD (Fig. 1). The second
human protein homologous to ASXL1 is ADRMl, whose tertiary
structure shows it to consist of a bundle of eight alpha-helices (Chen
et (11., 2010). ADRMl is a proteasome subunit that serves as a
receptor for both ubiquitin and Uch37 (Chen et (11., 2010; Hamazaki
et (11., 2006; Qiu et (11., 2006; Yao et (11., 2006). Again, this ADRMl
region is known to bind the C-terminal Uch37 ULD and hence
was initially called the Uch37-binding domain (Yao et (11., 2006).
However, owing to its afﬁnity for a speciﬁc portion (the ULD of
Uch37) and its presence as a DEUBiquitinase ADaptor (DEUBAD)
domain in other proteins, we term these DEUBAD domains. The
presence of the DEUBAD domain in ASXL1 and its presence within
a region known to interact with BAP1 (Scheuermann et (11., 2010)
strongly implicates the ASXL1 DEUBAD domain in binding to the
C-terminal BAP1 ULD (Fig. 1).

2.2 Identifying a putative DNA-BINDING domain

Although these observations help to explain how the ASXL1
DEUBAD domain regulates BAP1 deubiquitinase activity within
PR—DUB, they fail to explain the proposed transcription factor
ﬁinction of ASXL1 (Cho et (11., 2006; Lee et (11., 2010; Park
et (11., 2011). To do this, we turned to the region N-terminal of the
ASXL1 DEUBAD domain whose sequence is well conserved among
diverse metazoa from vertebrates to cnidarians such as Nematostella
vectensis, although not in Drosophila melanogaster (Supplementary
Fig. S2).

Using the HHpred server (Soding et (11., 2005), the proﬁle
generated for the conserved ASXL1 N-terminal region matched
the forkhead domain of FOXOl protein (PDB-ID:3coa) (Brent
et (11., 2008) with a signiﬁcant E-value of 0.028 (estimated error
rate <8%). Moreover, in support of the ﬁrst match, the next
ﬁve most statistically signiﬁcant matches are members of the
forkhead superfamily of transcription factors (AFX, PDB-ID: 1e17,
E-value = 0.089; FOXKla, PDB-ID:2c6y, E-value = 0.16; FOXO4,
PDB-ID:3l2c, E-value = 0.35 and; NF3G, PDB-ID: 1vtn, E-value =
0.68) (Boura et (11., 2010; Clark et (11., 1993; Tsai et (11., 2006). The
consistency of secondary structure predictions and corroboration
by proﬁle-to-proﬁle comparison (HHpred) methods, taken together
provide strong evidence that animal ASX proteins contain a forkhead
domain located at their N-termini.

By inspecting previously characterized forkhead domain
structures in interaction with DNA (Brent et (11., 2008; Boura et (11.,
2010; Clark et (11., 1993; Stroud et (11., 2006; Tsai et (11., 2006), we
identiﬁed two types of positions whose conservation would be in
agreement with a DNA-binding role for the ASXL1 forkhead domain
(Supplementary Fig. S2): (i) residues that have been implicated in
non-speciﬁc DNA binding (DNA backbone contacts) are indicated
by blue triangles above the alignment and (ii) indicated with
black triangles and boxes are two residues located in alpha-helix 3
(Asn5l and His61; human ASXL1) which correspond to Asn165 and
His169 of HNF3G (Clark et (11., 1993) that are predicted to confer
DNA-binding sequence speciﬁcity (major groove DNA contacts).

In agreement with a DNA-binding role for the ASXL1 forkhead
domain, candidate ASX orthologues from plants contain, rather than
a forkhead domain, a different, GATA zinc ﬁnger DNA-binding
domain at their N-termini (Supplementary Fig. S2) (subfamily IV

of Arabidopsis thaliana GATA zinc ﬁngers; GATA26 and GATA27)
(Manﬁeld et (11., 2007).

The human ASXL1 protein, therefore, likely binds DNA through
its N-terminal forkhead domain thereby conferring DNA sequence
speciﬁcity to the PR—DUB complex activity of histone H2A
deubiquitination. In a similar manner, a forkhead domain that has
recently been identiﬁed in the trithorax protein ASH2L appears to
link sequence-speciﬁc DNA binding to histone H3K4 methylation
(Chen et (11., 2011; Sarvan et (11., 2011).

Although we were ﬁnalizing this article, a bioinformatic analysis
of ASXL1 was published (Aravind and Iyer, 2012), mainly
focused on the identiﬁcation of the N-terminal winged helix-turn-
helix/forkhead domain. Our article is consistent with this report, but
further extends the ASX family analysis by showing the structural
and functional predictions for the DEUBAD domain.

3 CONCLUSION

In summary, the computational identiﬁcation of the DEUBAD
and forkhead domains in the human ASXL1 protein should now
greatly assist in experimentally delineating its critical function in
regulating the histone code under non-pathological and pathological
conditions.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Systematic dissection of the ubiquitylation proteome is
emerging as an appealing but challenging research topic because of
the significant roles ubiquitylation play not only in protein degradation
but also in many other cellular functions. High-throughput experimen-
tal studies using mass spectrometry have identified many ubiquityla-
tion sites, primarily from eukaryotes. However, the vast majority of
ubiquitylation sites remain undiscovered, even in well-studied sys-
tems. Because mass spectrometry—based experimental approaches
for identifying ubiquitylation events are costly, time-consuming and
biased toward abundant proteins and proteotypic peptides, in silico
prediction of ubiquitylation sites is a potentially useful alternative strat-
egy for whole proteome annotation. Because of various limitations,
current ubiquitylation site prediction tools were not well designed to
comprehensively assess proteomes.

Results: We present a novel tool known as UbiProber, specifically
designed for large-scale predictions of both general and species-spe-
cific ubiquitylation sites. We collected proteomics data for ubiquityla-
tion from multiple species from several reliable sources and used them
to train prediction models by a comprehensive machine-learning ap-
proach that integrates the information from key positions and key
amino acid residues. Cross-validation tests reveal that UbiProber
achieves some improvement over existing tools in predicting spe-
cies-specific ubiquitylation sites. Moreover, independent tests show
that UbiProber improves the areas under receiver operating charac-
teristic curves by ~15% by using the Combined model.

1 INTRODUCTION

The 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Aaron
Ciechanover, Avram Hershko and Irwin Rose for their discovery
of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation in eukaryotes.

Numerous studies subsequent to their original work showed
that the ubiquitiniproteasome system (UPS) plays a critical
role in regulating a variety of biological processes, such as the
cell cycle and division, the immune response, inﬂammation and
signal transduction (Reinstein and Ciechanover, 2006). Further
analysis proposed that ubiquitin-mediated ubiquitylation was a
ubiquitous post-translational modiﬁcation in eukaryotes.
Ubiquitylation has a conserved proteasome system in which
the conjugation of ubiquitin to substrates usually involves
three steps (Pickart and Eddjns, 2004). Ubiquitin is first activated
by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), then conjugated to a ubi-
quitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and finally transferred to a sub-
strate molecule with the assistance of a ubiquitin-ligase enzyme
(E3), forming an isopeptide bond with an internal lysine of the
target protein. In the UPS, ubiquitylation regulates a variety of
biological processes. Thereby, aberrations of UPS function in all
of the above-mentioned processes have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of human diseases, ranging from inﬂammatory
neurodegenerative diseases, to various forms of malignancies
(Mani and Gelmann, 2005; Reinstein and Ciechanover, 2006).
To further decipher the mechanism of the UPS or other regu-
latory roles of ubiquitylation at the molecular level, an initial but
crucial step is to identify ubiquitylation substrates and the cor-
responding ubiquitylation sites (Haglund and Dikic, 2005).
Researchers have used several experimental methods to purify
ubiquitylation sites, such as the use of afﬁnity-tagged ubiquitin
(Tomlinson et al., 2007), ubiquitin antibodies and ubiquitin-
binding proteins (Kim et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2010) and high-
throughput mass spectrometry (MS) technique (Peng et al., 2003;
Wagner et al., 2011). Unfortunately, experimental identification
of ubiquitylation sites in a global manner is still a difﬁcult, ex-
pensive and time-consuming task (Hitchcock et al., 2003; Ikeda
and Dikic, 2008). Hence, in silico prediction of ubiquitylation
events can be highly valuable in many cases. Tung and Ho
(2008) designed the ﬁrst ubiquitylation sites predictor
(UbiPred) using a support vector machine (SVM) with 31 in-
formative physicochemical features selected from the published
amino acid indices (Kawashima and Kanehisa, 2000).
Subsequently, Radivojac et a]. (2010) proposed a random
forest-based predictor called UbPred, in which 586 sequence at-
tributes were used as the input feature vectors. Lee et a]. (2011)
developed a method, UbSite, using an efﬁcient radial basis func-
tion (RBF) network to identify protein ubiquitylation sites.

Prediction of Protein Ubiquitylation Sites

 

CKSAAP_UbSite was constructed by Chen et a]. (2011) for iden-
tifying ubiquitylation sites by using the composition of k—space
amino acid pairs surrounding a query site with the assistance of a
SVM. Recently, Cai et a]. (2012) presented a method based on
multi-sequence features and the nearest neighbor algorithm.
These computational methods can be divided into two cate-
gories: methods of ubiquitylation site prediction for single species
and multispecies. UbPred and CKSAAP_UbSite fall into the
ﬁrst category. The latter category includes UbiPred, UbSite
and the method of Cai et a]. More information about these
tools or methods is given in Supplementary Table S1.

Despite the availability of various ubiquitylation site prediction
methods, they have limitations when applied to whole proteomes.
The ﬁrst limitation of ubiquitylation site prediction is accuracy.
The overall performance of the several aforementioned predictors
is still not fully satisfactory, and there is still room to improve the
predictive accuracy. The second limitation is that the ubiquityla-
tion relationships among different species are not discussed in
these methods. Additionally, there is no systematic species-speciﬁc
model to maximize the predictor performance of ubiquitylation
sites. The third limitation is the training data deﬁciency and
homology bias that lead to lack of statistical signiﬁcance.
Furthermore, some of these tools were only published as a
method and did not provide a user-friendly web service, and this
makes predictions a laborious or impossible task. Even those tools
with web services either do not support stringency adjustment or
only support several predeﬁned stringency levels from which a
user can choose that may not meet every user’s requirement.
User control of the prediction stringency is important, especially
for large-scale predictions, because typically a user is interested
only in predictions above a certain conﬁdence threshold.

To address the limitations of the existing methods, we de-
veloped a new tool known as UbiProber, which is speciﬁcally
designed to predict both general and species-speciﬁc ubiquityla-
tion sites. Reliable and large-scale experimental ubiquitin prote-
omics data from multiple species were collected from several
sources and used to train the ubiquitylation site prediction
models. Three sets of features [k nearest neighbor (KNN) feature,
physicochemical property (PCP) and amino acid composition
(AAC)] were extracted from the training data and combined
using a SVM to make predictions. The KNN features capture
the local sequence similarity around sites that are ubiquitylated
by the same enzyme or enzyme family regardless of whether the
enzymeisubstrate interactions are known. PCPs and AACs re-
ﬂect the biochemical environment of the regions surrounding
ubiquitylation sites, and these regions play various roles in the
structure and function of a protein. Additionally, to extract
the meaningful information and enhance the overall accuracy
of the predictor, the information gain (IG) method (Chen
et al., 2009) was first used to choose some key positions and
key amino acid residues to optimize each feature set.
Furthermore, we discussed the relationship of ubiquitylation in
different species. Our analysis shows the following: (i) the ubiqui-
tylation patterns are conserved across different species; (ii) some
key positions and key amino acid residues are essential for im-
proving the prediction performance of a ubiquitylation model;
and (iii) the physicochemical properties of residues in the ﬂanking
sequences are important for the ubiquitylation process.

Finally, the software system and web service of UbiProber
were implemented in .Net 4.0 framework and are freely available
to academic researchers. In UbiProber, we have trained the
general prediction model for a eukaryotic proteome and spe-
cies-specific prediction models for three species-speciﬁc prote-
omes. In addition, UbiProber supports continuous stringency
adjustment to meet the various conﬁdence requirements of
users. Cross-validation tests and comparisons with other tools
show that UbiProber performs better at general prediction and is
comparable with existing methods at species-speciﬁc predictions.
We believe that UbiProber could serve as a powerful and com-
plementary tool for in vivo or in vitro ubiquitylation site identi-
ﬁcation. Additionally, the combination of computational
analyses with experimental veriﬁcation could greatly speed up
our systematic understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics
of ubiquitylation.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data collection and preprocessing

Ubiquitylation data for three species, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae from several sources including PhosphoSite
(December 23, 2012), UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (December 23, 2012),
UbiProt (Chernorudskiy et al., 2007), SCUD (Lee et al., 2008) and two
large-scale proteomics studies (Kim et al., 2011; Radivojac et al., 2010)
were collected (Fig. 1). Although there are exceptions (Supplementary
Table S2), ubiquitin is usually attached to lysine residues of proteins
(Shimizu et al., 2010). Therefore, we only considered lysine ubiquityla-
tion. Supplementary Table S3 lists the ubiquitylation data sources and
statistics for different sources for each species. The original dataset con-
tained 11 547 proteins covering different species; of these proteins, 8044
are from H.sapiens, 3355 are from M .musculus and 208 are from
S .cerevisiae. After removing the redundant protein sequences to eliminate
homology bias using the program cd-hit (Li and Godzik, 2006), we ob-
tained 6323 H .sapiens, 2342 M .musculus and 145 S. cerevisiae distinct pro-
teins among which the sequence identity was <40%. Afterward, we
randomly selected 20 proteins from the datasets of three species to
form the independent test sets, and the remaining 8024, 2322, 125 proteins
were used to construct the training set, respectively.

We truncated these sequences to 27-residue long symmetrical windows
(—13 ~ +13) with lysine residues at the center to characterize the ubiqui-
tylation sites, and obtained 25194H.sapiens sequence segments, 5348

M.musculus sequence segments and 175 S.cerevisiae sequence segments
for the positive training sets. Redundant segments with sequence similar-
ity >40% were also removed again by using the cd-hit algorithm, and the
ﬁnal positive training datasets contained 18085 H .sapiens,
3986 M .musculus and 121 S. cerevisiae symmetrical segments. At present,
there is no uniform standard for constructing a negative sample. In this
work, it would be difﬁcult to prove deﬁnitively that a particular lysine
residue is not ubiquitylated under any conditions. However, almost all
researchers (Cai et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2011; Radivojac
et al., 2010) of ubiquitylation prediction use a strategy in which any lysine
residue that is not marked by any ubiquitylation information on the same
protein is a non-ubiquitylation site. In addition, Radivojac et a]. (2010)
concluded that this strategy did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the prediction
performance for a model of yeast. In fact, although ubiquitylation occurs
frequently in cells, the amount of ubiquitylation sites is still small com-
pared with the large amount of peptide sequences. Thus, non-ubiquityla-
tion sites should dominate negative samples. Therefore, we adopted this
strategy for choosing negative training sets. Because the number of ubi-
quitylation sites and non-ubiquitylation sites were highly imbalanced, we
randomly chose negative samples (non-ubiquitylation segments) for
10 times to match the number of positive ones (ubiquitylation segments)
in the training sets. In the independent test sets, we retained the entire
positive and the same number of negative samples to make it close to
the training situation. There were 61, 45 and 43 positive samples for
H .sapiens, M .musculus and S .cerevisiae, respectively. Following the evalu-
ation by 5-fold cross-validation, the trained model with the highest ac-
curacy was further evaluated using an independent test. The independent
test sets were used to test not only the proposed method but also the
previously proposed ubiquitylation prediction tools, UbiPred, UbPred
and CKSAAP_UbSite.

2.2 Feature extraction

KNN Features To take advantage of the cluster information of local
sequences for predicting ubiquitylation sites, we used the local sequence
around a possible ubiquitylation site in a query protein and extracted
features from similar sequences in both the positive and negative sets
by a KNN algorithm as follows:

(I) For a query site (possible ubiquitylation site), ﬁnd its KNNs
in the positive and negative sets, respectively, according to the
local sequence similarity. For two local sequence s1 and s2, the
distance Dist(s1,s2) is deﬁned as

p
X Stm(s1(t).s2(i»

Dist(s1,s2) = 1 —’:”’T (1)
where [7 denotes the number of ﬂanking residues from the central
site in the protein sequence fragment, and i denotes the position
of an amino acid in the target sequence segment. Sim, the amino
acid similarity matrix, is derived from the BLOSUM62 substitu-
tion matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992) as

M(a, b) — min{M}

Sim(a, b) = m

(2)
where a and b are two amino acids, M is the substitution matrix
and max/min{M} represent the largest/smallest number in the
matrix, respectively.

(11) The corresponding KNN feature is then extracted as follows:
(i) Form a set of neighbors, known as the Comparison set, by
combining the positive and negative sets; (ii) Calculate the aver-
age distances from the query sequences to the Comparison set;
(iii) Sort the neighbors by the distances, and pick the KNNs;
(iv) Calculate the KNN score, which is the percentage of positive
neighbors (ubiquitylation sites) in its KNNs; and (v) To obtain

multiple features, choose k as different values of the size of the
training dataset. In UbiProber, ﬁve KNN scores were extracted
as features for ubiquitylation prediction.

PCP AAindex (Kawashima and Kanehisa, 2000) is a database of
amino acid indices and amino acid mutation matrices. Currently, 544
PCPs can be retrieved from the database of version 9.0. An amino acid
index is a set of 20 numerical values representing various PCPs of amino
acid. The structure and function of proteins are largely dependent on
various properties of each of the 20 amino acids.

PCP has been successfully applied to predict such protein modiﬁcation
as phosphorylation (Moses et al., 2007), acetylation (Lee et al., 2010) and
sulfation (Niu et al., 2010). Moreover, Tung and Ho (2008) and
Radivojac et a]. (2010) have shown that the feature set of PCPs is the
best type of feature for predicting ubiquitylation sites. Consequently,
some informative PCPs were selected in our work by comparing the
prediction accuracy of all PCPs. The comparison results are displayed
in Supplementary Figures S17S3. Here, the top six PCPs were selected
and deﬁned as informative features for the prediction model. The inform-
ative PCPs are shown in Supplementary Table S4.

AAC Lee et a]. (2011) and Radivojac et a]. (2010) analyzed the AAC
of the sequences surrounding ubiquitylation sites in their works and
found that the AAC can be a useful features for ubiquitylation site pre-
diction. Hence, in this work, AAC was used in the same manner as the
researchers described. We calculated the amino acid frequencies in the
sequence surrounding the query site (the site itself is not counted). There
are 20 types of amino acids, and thus 20 frequencies are calculated, the
sum of which is 1.

2.3 Feature optimization

All positions and amino acid residues in a protein are not equally
important. Some are essential for the proper structure and function of a
protein. In addition, there are also differences for homologous proteins in
different species (W hisstock and Lesk, 2003). Although mammalian pro-
teins show a high degree of sequences similarity, there are still differences
in protein function among different species (Gabaldon and Huynen, 2004).
Here, a well-established feature selection method, IG (Chen et al., 2009),
was ﬁrst used to distinguish the importance of different positions and
different residues for ubiquitylation sequence segments. The calculation
process is described in the Supplementary Materials. Using this method,
we ranked list of IG scores for 27 positions and 20 amino acid residues.
Note that the larger the IG scores of positions or residues are, the more
important the positions or residues are. Therefore, the positions and resi-
dues were sorted from high to low using the IG score, after which we
trained the model only using the top n positions and the top m residues.
In this way, we chose key positions and key residues for optimizing the
features. The optimized processes were performed using the following pro-
cedures: (i) Key positions were used in KNN features; when we calculated
the KNN score, Equation (1) was calculated using only the key positions
[that is to say i equal to key positions in Equation (1)]. (ii) Key positions
were used in the PCP features and key residues were used in the AAC
features; only the features of the key positions were extracted after calcu-
lating the PCP features, and only the features of the key residues were
extracted after calculating the AAC features.

2.4 Model training and evaluation

We used the extracted features to train the ubiquitylation prediction
models. As illustrated in Figure 1, the model construction procedure con-
sisted of two separate procedures: model learning and model evaluation.

S VM Learning As a machine-learning method of binary classiﬁca-
tion, SVM aims to ﬁnd a rule that best maps each member of a training

Prediction of Protein Ubiquitylation Sites

 

set to the correct classiﬁcation (Vapnik, 1999), and SVM has been used
for diverse prediction/classiﬁcation tasks related to protein bioinfor-
matics. Using the feature encoding of the key positions and key
amino acid residues, the SVM was trained to distinguish ubiquitylation
and non-ubiquitylation sites in UbiProber. The implemented SVM
algorithm was LIBSVM (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm) and
the applied kernel function was the RBF. To maximize the performance
of the SVM algorithm, the grid search method was applied to tune the
parameters.

Performance Assessment To evaluate the prediction performance of
UbiProber, 5-fold cross-validation tests were performed. Receiver oper-
ating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted based on speciﬁcity (Sp)
and sensitivity (Sn), and the areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were
calculated using the trapezoidal approximation. The AUC provides a
measure of the classiﬁer performance; the larger the value of the AUC
is, the better the performance of the classiﬁer is. In addition, the Matthew
correlation coefﬁcient (M C C) was also used to evaluate the prediction
performance. The M C C accounts for true and false positives and nega-
tives and are usually regarded as a balanced measure that can be used
even if the classes are of different sizes. The Sn, Sp and M CC are deﬁned
as follows:

where TP, TN, FF and FN denote the number of true positives, true
negatives, false positives and false negatives, respectively.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 IG results

In this work, the IG method is first used to rank the importance
of positions and amino acid residues. The IG scores of positions
and residues for different species are calculated using the IG
method, and the results are listed in Supplementary Table S5.
This investigation focuses on the analysis of the similarities
and differences of important positions and residues for different
species. As shown in Figure 2A and B, there are differences in the
importance of the same position and residue for different species.
Taking the ubiquitylation proteins in S.cerevisiae, for example,
the positions of —10, —7, —6, —1, 1, 5, 6, 11 and the residues
of Cys, Asp, Glu, Ile, Leu, Lys are more important than other
positions and residues. Actually, this result has been validated by
several relevant reports. Catic et a]. (2004) found similar results
in which ubiquitylation sites in yeast proteins have a fold increase
in Asp and Glu at positions —2 and —1 compared against the
entire yeast proteome. Radivojac et a]. (2010) reported that a
feature of the ubiquitylation sequence of S .cerevisiae is the abun-
dance of Asp and Glu. In addition, Xu et al.’s (2010) analysis
showed that there is a subtle enrichment for mammalian proteins
at the positions of —2, —1, 1 and 2, which is in agreement with
our survey for H .sapiens and M .musculus. These results demon-
strate compositional differences between ubiquitylated and non-
ubiquitylated sequences at several speciﬁc positions and speciﬁc
residues.

residues around ubiquitylation sites. (C) The numbers in the box indicate
the positions of the ubiquitylation sequence segment. (D) The letters in
the box indicate the amino acid residues of the ubiquitylation sequence

Moreover, we perceived that the different species have signifi-
cant comparability after comparing the results for the top 15
positions and the top 12 residues of the three species according
to the IG score ranking. As can be seen from Figure 2C, some
positions (—7, —6, —2, —1, 1, 4, 6) are relatively more important
for the ubiquitylation of eukaryotic substrates, and we proposed
that the upstream positions are more important for the lysine
residue to be ubiquitylated. Additionally, we can see that each of
the species has unique key positions. There is a possibility that
ubiquitin-related enzymes are species speciﬁc, although the reac-
tion process is similar for eukaryotes (Pickart and Eddins, 2004).
Interestingly, we also found that evolutionarily closer species
have a more consistent trend in the key positions. For example,
H.sapiens and M .musculus are more similar than H.sapiens and
S.cerevisiae in the important positions. As can be seen from
Figure 2D, the involvement of residues (Cys, Glu, Lys and
Gly) in the interactional aspects of eukaryotic ubiquitylation
are relatively important. Similarly, each species has unique key
residues that are largely related to the amount of sample because
the IG score and the total number of sequences are closely
related; however, these results do not rule out the speciﬁcity of
the ubiquitin-related enzymes. In a summary, there are many
similarities in the ubiquitylated sequence preference of different
species.

Based on the information contained in this study, the possible
conclusions are that those key positions and key residues may
be more important to form the proper structure for enzyme
substrate interactions. The key positions and key residues
are conserved among different species. In fact, this ﬁnding is
in agreement with some ubiquitylation site surveys for eukaryotic
proteins in previous work (Haglund and Dikic, 2005; Peng
et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2010). This conclusion also provides
the theoretical basis to build a Combined model for general pre-
diction later.

3.2 KNN scores results

The KNN feature has been successfully used in phosphorylation
site prediction (Gao et al., 2010). The KNN scores measures
whether the local sequence surrounding a query site is more
similar to the ubiquitylation sequence or to non-ubiquitylation
sequences. A query sequence with a KNN score higher than 0.55
is more similar to the positive samples; a query sequence with a
KNN score lower than 0.55 is more similar to the negative sam-
ples. The larger the KNN score is, the more similar the site is to
some known ubiquitylation sites, and thus, the more likely it is
to be a ubiquitylation site. Figure 3 compares the KNN scores
between ubiquitylation and non-ubiquitylation sequences. (Due
to the gap of data, we selected different k values and Comparison
sets; Supplementary Table S6.) As can be seen, there is a signifi-
cant difference among various values of k in the KNN score;
ubiquitylation sequences have larger KNN scores than non-
ubiquitylation sequences. For ubiquitylation, the average KNN
scores with different sizes of nearest neighbors are within
0.5}080 for all three species. Therefore, the local sequences
surrounding known ubiquitylation sites are more similar to
their nearest neighbors in the positive set (excluding self-matches)
on average as expected. Note that such similarities are not due to
protein homology because the global sequence similarity between
any two proteins in our non-redundant datasets is either insig-
niﬁcant or low. This ﬁnding conﬁrms that ubiquitylation-related
clusters exist in local sequences around ubiquitylation sites.
For non-ubiquitylation sites, the average KNN scores are
~0.5, which means that overall the sequences in the negative
set are not predominantly more similar to the nearest neighbors
in either the positive or negative set. This result is not surprising
because ubiquitylation-related sequence clusters are unlikely to
exist in the negative set, and thus, the sequences in the negative
set have a similar chance to find close neighbors in either the
positive or negative set. In short, the KNN scores capture the
cluster information in the local sequence around ubiquitylation

and non-ubiquitylation sequences. (A) Histogram of KNN scores of
ﬁve thresholds (K1:0.00125, K2:0.0025, K3:0.005, K4:0.01,

M.musculus. The error bars represent 90% conﬁdence intervals.
(B) Comparison of mean KNN scores between the ubiquitylation se-

sites and hence distinguish them from the background.
Therefore, KNN scores are suitable to be used as features for
ubiquitylation site prediction.

KNN scores are effective features when used for predicting
both general and species-speciﬁc ubiquitylation sites. For ubiqui-
tylation site predictions, KNN scores can automatically capture
the local sequence similarity between substrates of a common
ubiquitin-related enzyme or ubiquitin-related enzyme family
without relying on knowledge of enzymesisubstrate interactions
or enzymes-binding sequence motifs. Therefore, although most
known ubiquitylation sites have no annotation about their cor-
responding enzymes, KNN scores can still use the inherent clus-
ter information in them. Oftentimes, one enzyme corresponds to
multiple local sequence motifs, and using a single sequence pro-
file may not be as effective as KNN, which better handles diverse
sequence clusters.

3.3 PCP results

From the previous work (Radivojac et al., 2010; Tung and Ho,
2008), we knew that informative PCPs play an important role
in ubiquitylation prediction. Here, a speciﬁc example of inform-
ative PCPs in H.sapiens was provided. As can be seen from
Supplementary Table S4, the property ‘Positive charge’
(FAUJ880111) plays an important role in predicting ubiquityla-
tion sites. We calculated the mean positive charge at each pos-
ition (excluding the ubiquitylation site itself) in ubiquitylation
sequences and non-ubiquitylation sequences and depicted them
in Figure 4. It is clear that the ubiquitylation sequences and non-
ubiquitylation sequences have different charge pattern. The posi-
tive charge of the ubiquitylation sequences at certain upstream
positions (—13 ~ —4) and certain downstream positions (6~ 12)
is higher than the charge in the non-ubiquitylation sequences.
The positive charge in some positions (—2, —1, 1, 2 and 3)
near the central sites and some downstream positions (5 and
13) of the non-ubiquitylation sequences are higher than that of
the ubiquitylation sequences. This difference is more remarkable
in the upstream and ubiquitylation sites nearby than in the
downstream position. This result is entirely consistent with the
previously mentioned IG results that also prove the importance
and availability of the IG method, which can ﬁnd key differ-
ences. In addition, we are also surprised to ﬁnd that the ubiqui-
tylation sequences contain more positively charged amino acid

residues (Lys, Arg) than do the non-ubiquitylation sequences in
the subsequent AAC results (Fig. 5). In short, this investigation
fully proves that informative PCPs can contribute to distinguish-
ing ubiquitylation sequences and non-ubiquitylation sequences.

3.4 AAC results

In this section, we will study the difference between the AAC
surrounding ubiquitylation sites and those of non-ubiquitylation
sites. In Figure 5, from left to right, the amino acids vary from
being enriched to being depleted in the surrounding sequences
of ubiquitylation sites. With slight variations among different
species, the overall trends are similar. For ubiquitylated
sequences, hydrophobic residues, Ala, Val, Leu and Ile, are
enriched in the region surrounding ubiquitylation sites, whereas
hydrophilic residues, Cys, His, Thr, Ser and Lys, are depleted.
This result has been conﬁrmed in a ubiquitylation site survey om
et al., 2010). Furthermore, the charged amino acids Arg and Asp
are enriched in the ubiquitylated sequences, and the uncharged
residues Cys, Met, Trp, Thr, Ser and Lys are depleted. This in-
vestigation also implies that the different compositions of amino
acids surrounding ubiquitylation sites and non-ubiquitylation
sites justify the use of amino acid frequencies as a feature for
ubiquitylation site prediction.

3.5 Using IG optimize the model

Three feature sets (KNN, PCP and AAC) as well as their com-
bined feature sets were evaluated before using the IG method by
means of 5-fold cross-validation. The results showed that the
prediction performance was enhanced through combined fea-
tures, as displayed in Supplementary Table S7. To further im-
prove the prediction performance, these features were optimized
based on the above-mentioned IG optimization method. In this
work, we trained the model only using the top n (n: 7 ~ 20, 27)
positions and the top m (m=9~20) amino acids. The results
are displayed in Supplementary Figure S4. For comparison, we
chose key positions and key amino acid residues (Supplementary
Table S5) for different species that would be used to optimize
model. The prediction performance of the optimized features
was also evaluated as shown in Supplementary Table S7. The
predictive accuracy for the models trained with the optimized
features improved compared with the accuracy using the
non-optimized features, as expected. This result indicates that

the key positions and amino acid residues used in optimizing
the models can promote the performance of ubiquitylation
sites prediction. Consequently, the models combined with key
positions and amino acid residues were applied to implement a
novel and high-performance tool for identifying lysine
ubiquitylation.

3.6 Species-speciﬁc Ubiquitylation site prediction of
UbiProber

The proposed UbiProber predictor trained and tested three
models of H.sapiens, M .musculus and S.cerevisiae based on the
combined features and the IG method. To evaluate the perform-
ance of UbiProber for species-speciﬁc ubiquitylation site predic-
tion, we performed a 5-fold cross-validation test in each species.
Sensitivities at different speciﬁcity levels in each cross-validation
run were calculated according to Equations (3) and (4). By
taking different thresholds, we then plotted the ROC curves
and calculated the AUCs, as shown in Figure 6.

The three models, H.sapiens, M .musculus and S.cerevisiae
achieved AUCs of 80.94, 82.11 and 83.40%, respectively. We
knew that the most conﬁdent predictions are those with high
speciﬁcities. From the ROC curves, for the H.sapiens,
M .musculus and S.cerevisiae models, the prediction sensitivities
reached 37, 43 and 46% at the 90% speciﬁcity level, respectively,
and 22, 22.5 and 27.5% at the 95% speciﬁcity level, respectively.
Interestingly, from the ROC curves, the predictions for S. cere-
visiae performed significantly better than those for H.sapiens.
This result can be explained by the fact that KNN features in
S.cerevisiae show stronger patterns in distinguishing positive and
negative data, as shown in Figure 3.

3.7 Cross-species prediction of general Ubiquitylation
sites

The performance of cross-species predictions using UbiProber
was evaluated against three species. An independent test dataset
was built for evaluation by randomly selecting 20 proteins
from the non-redundant dataset of each species. UbiProber has
built three prediction models for every species. We also built a
combined prediction model using the data by combining the

three training datasets and running the non-redundant dataset
building procedure with an identity threshold of 40%. The tests
were then performed by submitting all ubiquitylation sequence
segments, and the same number of non-ubiquitylation sequence
segments in each of the three test datasets to each of the four
prediction models. The AUCs and M CCs were calculated, as
shown in Table 1. Note that there was no overlap between the
training sets and the independent test sets.

For all test datasets, the prediction results from the model
trained using data from the same species performed the best
(considering only AUC). For each of the three independent
test datasets, the performances did not have large variations
using different models trained on data from different species.
As a possible explanation, although ubiquitin-conjugating en-
zymes and their substrates vary in different species, the biophys-
ical mechanism of enzymeisubstrate binding remains the same.
The results suggest that UbiProber and the associated prediction
models can be used for cross-species predictions of general ubi-
quitylation sites, which is especially useful when the ubiquityla-
tion data in a species of interest is not sufﬁcient for training a
prediction model. Interestingly, for cross-species predictions,
there is no apparent evidence that using a model trained on
data from an evolutionarily closer species would perform
better. As an example, for the M .musculus test dataset, the pre-
dictions from the S .cerevisiae model performed better than those
from other models, except the M .musculus model itself. Given
the small test data size, this may not be statistically signiﬁcant.
The performance variations in various models may be partially
due to different quantities and qualities of ubiquitylation data in
different species.

3.8 Comparison with other general prediction tools

To further evaluate the performance of general ubiquitylation
site prediction by UbiProber, we compared it with three existing
web service tools, UbiPred, UbPred and CKSAAP_UbSite.
Because different training data and methods were used in these
tools, the prediction performance varies greatly among them. To
avoid any bias, here, we applied the same independent test dataset
(containing the test data of three species) as that used in the cross-
species prediction evaluation. Sequences of these 20 proteins
of each species dataset and sequences of these 60 proteins of
the combined dataset were submitted to UbiPred, UbPred and
CKSAAP_UbSite for prediction. As a comparison, the AUC
results comparing the predictions of the different tools are
shown in Table 2. UbiProber achieves signiﬁcantly higher AUC

values than those of the other tools. Depending on our Combined
model, UbiProber improved the AUC by 16.92, 17.42, 14.78 and
17.32% in the H. dataset, M. dataset, S. dataset and Combined
dataset, respectively. The data source of the experimental ubiqui-
tylation sites for the above three existing tools was collected from
UbiProt, which mainly stores only a few hundred yeast ubiquity-
lation proteins. However, UbiProber integrated the experimental
ubiquitylation sites from multiple resources (Fig. 1), which accu-
mulated the ubiquitylation data from thousands of proteins from
multiple species. These resources could partially explain why the
UbiProber outperforms other predictors. In UbiPred and
CKSAAP_UbSite, the low AUC can be partly attributed to the
use of single feature, which cannot fully extract features for ubi-
quitylated sequences. In contrast, UbiProber integrated three fea-
tures to ensure the complete extraction of the sequence
information. In addition to the AUC value comparison, we also
calculated the M CC, sensitivity and specificity for comparisons
with other tools, as shown in Supplementary Table S8. The results
show that the above three tools can achieve high speciﬁcity, but
sacriﬁcing sensitivity would therefore result in a low M CC .
UbiProber offers good sensitivity as well as high speciﬁcity,
which also illustrates that our method is superior to the current
methods. Note that, when performing the comparisons, we used a
prediction model that was trained from a dataset excluding the
protein sequences in the independent test dataset. However, for
UbiPred, UbPred and CKSAAP_UbSite, some of the test pro-
teins might have been included in their training processes, and
thus, the prediction performances may be biased favorably
toward these tools in the comparisons. This possibility means
that the performance improvement of UbiProber over these
tools might be underestimated.

3.9 Software and web implementation

We have developed a stand-alone software system and web
server, UbiProber, to implement the described ubiquitylation
site prediction method. Currently, the software system and web
server of UbiProber are implemented as a Windows application
in the .NET 4.0 framework using the C# language. The web
server and software system always share the same function.
Supplementary Figure S5 shows an example of the prediction
interfaces of the software system and web server. The software

3.10 Limitations and future work

Our method obtained a satisfactory success rate on large data
sources, totaling 11 547 proteins, and also indicates that the key
position and key amino acid residue features are promising for
annotating ubiquitylation events in proteomes. In spite of this,
our method still has certain limitations, which are common to
almost all current prediction tools. First, although computa-
tional predictions indicate the possibilities that query sites can/
cannot be ubiquitylated, our predicted results have not been
correlated to different cell states or tissue conditions. We are
trying to develop some novel models of ubiquitylation for spe-
ciﬁc cellular conditions, which are sparse in current ubiquityla-
tion studies. Second, the ubiquitylation sites used in the training
data were mostly identiﬁed by MS methods, which may have an
inherent bias in terms of representing the global ubiquitylation
events and hence may affect the prediction performance. As tech-
niques such as electron transfer dissociation and alternative pro-
teases are helping to resolve technology limitations, more
complete ubiquitylation datasets will be released. We will adapt
our program and prediction models as the new data become
available. Third, a data limitation is that we have only labeled
positive data, but we have not labeled negative data (i.e. it would
be difﬁcult to prove definitively that a particular lysine residue is
not ubiquitylated under any conditions.) Therefore, if some of
them are predicted to be ubiquitylation sites, we do not know
whether they are false positives. For future work, we will try to
develop some novel methods that do not require a negative data
or only require few solid negative data (such as semi-supervised
learning). In this way, it is expected that the bias caused by the
negative data can also be reduced.

4 CONCLUSION

The annotation of protein ubiquitylation sites in proteomes is a
crucial step in decoding the signaling networks in living cells. In
recent years, tens of thousands of ubiquitylation sites in various
species have been identiﬁed by large-scale MS—based studies.
However, the vast majority of ubiquitylation sites, especially in
non-mammal species, still remain undiscovered. Considering the
limitations of MS-based experimental studies, a more practical
and efficient approach will be in silico large-scale ubiquitylation
site prediction. In this work, we have developed a novel compu-
tational method and computer program, UbiProber, for the
highly speciﬁc prediction of ubiquitylation sites. Cross-validation
tests and comparisons with other tools show that UbiProber
performs better at general predictions and is comparable with
existing methods at species-speciﬁc predictions. Unlike experi-
mental approaches, computational predictions are capable of
proteome-wide predictions without inherent technical biases.
Furthermore, UbiProber could provide an even more powerful
and cost-effective approach by combining experimental and
computational methods iteratively, which could be especially
useful for some hypothesis-driven experiments. In conclusion,
UbiProber provides a unique tool for large-scale ubiquitylation
site identiﬁcation, and it is hoped that UbiProber will accelerate

the accumulation of our knowledge on protein ubiquitylation
and hence help to explore the corresponding regulatory networks
in living cells.

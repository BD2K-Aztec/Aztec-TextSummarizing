ABSTRACT

Motivation: Theoretical models of biological networks are
valuable tools in evolutionary inference. Theoretical models
based on gene duplication and divergence provide biologically
plausible evolutionary mechanics. Similarities found between
empirical networks and their theoretically generated counterpart
are considered evidence of the role modeled mechanics play in
biological evolution. However, the method by which these models
are parameterized can lead to questions about the validity of
the inferences. Selecting parameter values in order to produce a
particular topological value obfuscates the possibility that the model
may produce a similar topology for a large range of parameter
values. Alternately, a model may produce a large range of topologies,
allowing (incorrect) parameter values to produce a valid topology
from an otherwise flawed model. In order to lend biological credence
to the modeled evolutionary mechanics, parameter values should be
derived from the empirical data. Furthermore, recent work indicates
that the timing and fate of gene duplications are critical to proper
derivation of these parameters.

Results: We present a methodology for deriving evolutionary rates
from empirical data that is used to parameterize duplication and
divergence models of protein interaction network evolution. Our
method avoids shortcomings of previous methods, which failed to
consider the effect of subsequent duplications. From our parameter
values, we find that concurrent and existing existing duplication and
divergence models are insufficient for modeling protein interaction
network evolution. We introduce a model enhancement based on
heritable interaction sites on the surface of a protein and find that
it more closely reflects the high clustering found in the empirical
network.

1 INTRODUCTION

The study of biological networks is a promising area for arriving
at evolutionary inference. Gene duplication is regarded as the
primary evolutionary phenomenon driving protein network growth.
In theoretical models, gene duplication is represented through the
random copying of one of the proteins (nodes) in the network. Each
duplication is accompanied by ‘link dynamics’, the gain and loss
of interactions in the network based on theories of gene duplicate

fates. Model parameters control the probability at which interactions
are gained and lost with each duplication. Two models in particular,
5016 et al. (2002) and Vazquez et al. (2003) are exemplars of this
type of theoretical model.

The strategy used to afﬁrm the evolutionary mechanics captured
by these models is to compare the topology generated by these
networks with empirical biological networks. The models are seen
to be validated when the theoretical and empirical networks share
similar topological characteristics.

It therefore follows that proper parameterization of the models
is paramount to generating a network, which is plausible given the
model mechanics. Vazquez et a1. (2003) used the average number
of empirical protein interactions from empirical data (average
degree) as a constraint to ‘tune’ model parameter values, which
produced a similar theoretical network. 5016 et a1. (2002) derived
parameter estimates directly from empirical measurements based
on the fact that the model parameters represent the gain and loss of
interactions after gene duplication. Their interaction gain and loss
rate parameter values were based on examination of interactions of
known duplicates (i.e. paralogs; Wagner, 2001), the average degree
and mathematical constraints.

The mechanics featured in the Vazquez and 5016 models
are essential to this study. Gene duplication, loss of redundant
interactions between duplicates, the formation of new interactions
and interactions which form between paralogs when a self-
interacting protein’s gene is duplicated are all evolutionary
phenomena which have direct analogs in the Vazquez and 5016
models. It is these evolutionarily plausible mechanics to which we
give special attention. Can these mechanics be enhanced to improve
model performance while preserving the biological plausibility of
the enhancements?

Aside from Vazquez and 5016, there are numerous models that
have furthered our understanding of protein interaction network
evolution. One notable example is Berg et a1. (2004), who construct
a stochastic model based on empirical observations. The model
features protein interaction gain and loss, but the interaction loss
rate is predicated on preserving a constant network connectivity
rather than on a biologically identiﬁable phenomena. In another
example, Priulj et a1. (2004) ﬁnd that a geometric random graph
has a good topological ﬁt to empirical protein interaction networks.
Their geometric random graph is constructed by connecting nodes
based on their proximity from each other when arranged randomly
on a two-dimensional metric space. The mechanics of the model
are not evolutionarily plausible; they do not help us elucidate the
evolutionary processes that have contributed to the formation of the
network topology.

A strength of the Vazquez model over other models with
biologically faithful mechanics is that it does not require

Improving evolutionary models of protein interaction networks

 

neofunctionalization, the de novo addition of interactions to the
network. Recently, it has been revealed that neofunctionalization
in protein interaction network evolution has not been shown to be
prevalent as previously believed (Gibson and Goldberg, 2009a). The
Sole et al. model features the proliﬁc gain of de novo interactions.
Likewise Berg et al. (2004) suggest a model with very ﬂuid
link dynamics, which is directly premised on ubiquitous de novo
interaction gain (Gibson and Goldberg, 2009a; Wagner, 2003).

Given the drawbacks of the other models, Vazquez et al. stands
as the best theoretical model, which promotes gene duplication
and biologically plausible link dynamics as sufﬁcient evolutionary
mechanics for generating protein interaction networks. But despite
the model’s foundational prominence (Newman et al., 2006), the
parameterization used by Vazquez et al. (2003) merits a second
look. As we show later, a wide variety of parameter values produce
similar topological characteristics. This compromises the efﬁcacy
of the model’s evolutionary mechanics. Selecting parameter values
in order to produce a desired topology makes it problematic
to attribute the desired topology to the evolutionary mechanics.
The validation question should be ‘Do biologically justiﬁed
parameter values determined independently of the model produce
topological characteristics similar to empirical?’ The method of
parameterization used in the published model requires ﬁirther
analysis to reafﬁrm the role of gene duplication and biologically
plausible link dynamics play in the formation of protein interaction
networks.

Here, we develop an improved methodology for measuring
the rate of interaction gain and loss from empirical data. We
assign these rates to the Vazquez et al. model parameters and
identify the limits of the Vazquez et al. model. In an attempt to
overcome identiﬁed limits of this model, we incorporate and assess
two evolutionarily plausible modiﬁcations: subfunctionalization
asymmetry and heritable homomeric interactions.

We then introduce a new evolutionary model featuring
heritable interaction sites. That is, we associate a protein’s
interactions with one or more physical sites on the protein
responsible for the interaction binding. As the model evolves,
these sites are included in gene duplication events. Subsequent to
duplication, subﬁmctionalization of interactions is applied through
the interaction sites rather than to each interaction independently. We
ﬁnd that the model is more effective than the Vazquez et al. model at
reproducing clustering found in the empirical network, suggesting
the importance of heritable interaction sites in the evolution of
protein interaction networks.

2 METHODS
2.1 Network measures of subfunctionalization and
heteromerization

The Vazquez et al. model parameters reﬂect evolutionary rates that can
be estimated from extant data. (The Vazquez at al. model and the
empirical dataset are described in the Supplementary Materials.) The
subfunctionalization rate, that is the proportion of redundant interactions
lost between gene duplicates, can be measured as the number of interacting
neighbors not shared by both gene duplicates versus the total number of
neighbors the duplicates interact with. Previous studies have calculated
proportions of redundant interaction retention or loss by simple tallies of
neighbors in the empirical network (Beltrao and Serrano, 2007; Berg at al.,
2004; Chung at al., 2006; He and Zhang, 2005; Wagner, 2001, 2002, 2003).

This method fails to account for duplications that occur subsequent to
the duplication being measured (Gibson and Goldberg, 2009a). We have
abandoned the previous method in favor of utilizing interaction data drawn
from an evolutionary framework presented in Gibson and Goldberg (2009b).
Brieﬂy, a phylogeny of yeast species and phylogenetic gene trees were
combined with interaction data to reconstruct a putative timing of duplication
events along with associated interaction gain and loss. Further details are
available in the Methods of Supplementary Material. In Section 4.1, we
present an argument for our alternative rate estimation methodology and
identify issues with the earlier methodology.

As described in Gibson and Goldberg (2009b), the timed duplications
are binned into phylogenetic time periods. The subfunctionalization rate is
calculated at each phylogenetic time period. In the absence of more detailed
timing data, duplication events are assumed to have occurred simultaneously
within each phylogenetic time period. That is, the subfunctionalization rate
for a phylogenetic time period is measured only after all duplications (and
corresponding redundant interaction losses) within that time period have been
computed. This is semantically equivalent to treatng all duplications within
a phylogenetic time period as the product of a segmental- or whole-genome
duplication event.

More speciﬁcally, the subfunctionalization rate is calculated as:

Eli

t

:17;
t

 

where l, is the number of interactions at phylogenetic time period I lost due
to subfunctionalization, and p, is the number of potential interactions added
after all duplications for time period l but prior to interaction losses due
to subfunctionalization. Additional detail is provided in the Supplementary
Materials.

Supplementary Figure 1A shows the subfunctionalization rates measured
in the evolutionary framework. The mean subfunctionalization rate is 0.887.
That is, 88.7% of redundant interactions are lost between a neighbor and
either the progeny or progenitor.

Like subfunctionalization, the proportion of lost paralogous interactions
(interactions between homomeric progeny and progenitor duplicates which
are lost) is calculated using a similar approach. According to the evolutionary
framework (Gibson and Goldberg, 2009b), the ancestral protein is assumed
to have been self-interacting if either the progenitor or progeny protein is self-
interacting, or if an interaction exists between them. Including interactions
between the paralogs mitigates the paucity of self-interactions reported by
some assays (Gibson and Goldberg, 2009a).

The measure for the entire evolutionary history is aggregated similarly
to the subfunctionalization method and is presented in the Methods of
Supplementary Material. Using this measure, the probability of losing an
interaction between self-interacting progeny and progenitor proteins is 0.539
(Supplementary Fig. 1B). The complement, that is, the probability of an
interaction between paralogs being retained is 1 —0.539 20.461. Note that
this is subtly different from the original Vazquez et al. model parameter.
Our calculated parameter is the paralogous interaction retention rate among
homomeric duplications. The Vazquez at al. parameter is the combined
likelihood that the progenitor protein is self-interacting and the paralogous
interaction survives. The computed Vazquez rate is 0.24 (see Methods
of Supplementary Material). We also estimated parameters for several
alternative yeast datasets. For various datasets. the subfunctionalization rate
is relatively stable, but the paralogous interaction retention rate varies with
connectivity. Full details can be found in the Supplementary Materials and
are summarized in Supplementary Table 6.

From our calculations of the subfunctionalization and paralogous
heteromerization rates, we are able to derive a general rate of interaction
change for the species. Our derived rate is
1.2 X 10—5changed interactions/My. This comports well with a previously
published estimate of 2.4 X 10—5 changed interactions/My (Beltrao and
Serrano, 2007). Full details are provided in the Supplementary Materials.

Fig. 1. The iSite model. (A) A simple network showing that protein
interactions are tied to interaction sites on the protein surface. (B) A
duplication event duplicates both the interactions and their iSites. The self-
interacting iSite produces a self-interaction in the progeny and a paralogous
interaction between the progenitor’s and progeny’s self-interacting iSite.
Subfunctionalization is applied against all interactions of a redundant iSite
(here paired by yellow, purple, orange, dark olive and green colors).

2.2 The iSite model

The iSite model integrates additional biologically plausible features while
minimizing the increase in model complexity. The primary modiﬁcation is
to interaction semantics.

In the original Vazquez at al. model, each protein’s interaction is
independent from every other interaction the protein engages in. This
independence is reﬂected in the implementation of subfunctionalization.
The loss of one interaction from each pair of redundant interactions occurs
independently of all other redundant pairs. We modify this by associating
each interaction with an interaction site (iSite). An iSite is analogous to
the physical contact one protein makes with another to form an interaction.
Each interaction between two proteins requires two interaction sites, one
on each protein. Figure 1 illustrates the iSite concept. There is a one-
to-many relationship between iSites and interactions. Each iSite may be
associated with many interactions, but each interaction involves only two
iSites, one iSite on each protein participating in the interaction. The
number of interactions associated with an iSite changes during evolution
as shown on the neighbors in Figure 1B. Under this new model, the unit of
redundancy subject to subfunctionalization is the iSite, not the interaction.
For example, assume a protein has ﬁve interactions associated with a single
iSite. Upon duplication, all ﬁve interactions of the iSite are subject to
subfunctionalization as a single unit in either the progeny or progenitor
protein. That is, asymmetry drives whether the progeny or progenitor iSite
is selected, and then the subfunctionalization probability is applied to all
interactions of the iSite.

This reconceptualization of the relationship between proteins and
interactions also leads to a more biologically plausible implementation
of homomeric duplication. The Vazquez at al. model does not directly
incorporate self-interacting proteins. Instead, a parameter (p) is used as a
probability for adding an interaction between the progeny and progenitor
proteins. This probability corresponds to the combined likelihood that the
progenitor protein is self-interacting and the paralogous interaction survives.
The iSite model allows self interactions to be directly represented in the
network. The iSite model repurposes p to reﬂect the probability that a self-
interacting iSite is preserved. Conversely, 1— p is the probability an iSite is
silenced in one of the duplicates due to subfunctionalization.

The mechanics of interaction loss are identical for both iSites
featuring self interactions and other iSites. One iSite from each redundant
progeny/progenitor iSite pair is selected with equal probability. Once an iSite
is selected, each interaction within the iSite is silenced with probability (1.
Because all interactions within each redundant iSite are subject to silencing,
redundant interaction pairs are not lost independently as in the Vazquez
at al. model. Biologically, this acknowledges that individual mutations at an
interaction site do not necessarily silence all protein interactions at that site.

2.3 Heritable homomers

The Vazquez at al. model obviates the need to include self-interacting
proteins. (The Vazquez at al. model is described in the Supplementary

Materials.) The parameter [7 serves as a surrogate, indicating the probability
of adding an interaction between paralogs after each duplication. However,
self-interactions and their heritability can be readily accommodated with
few modiﬁcations to the model. Upon duplication of a self-interacting
protein, two interactions are added: a self-interaction for the progeny and
an interaction between the progenitor and progeny. Following the principle
of subfunctionalization, two of the three interactions (two self-interactions
plus the paralog-joining interaction) are redundant and may be lost according
to the p parameter.

We enhanced the Vazquez at al. model with heritable homomers, with
the parameter, p, repurposed to reﬂect the probability that the paralogous
interaction and/or one of the redundant self-interactions would be lost due
to subfunctionalization.

2.4 Asymmetry

The asymmetric divergence of gene duplicates can be readily modeled in
protein interaction evolution. Asymmetric divergence has been observed in
sequence mutations between gene duplicates (Byrne and Wolfe, 2007; Kellis
at al., 2004) as well as in coexpression neighbors and genetic interactions
(Chung at al., 2006; Wagner, 2002). The analog to sequence asymmetry
in protein interaction networks is subfunctionalization asymmetry, the
asymmetric loss of redundant interactions between gene duplicates (Wagner,
2002)

Both the $016 at al. (2002) and Vazquez at al. (2003) models
feature subfunctionalization, but each handles asymmetry differently
(Supplementary Fig. 5). Subfunctionalization in the $016 at al. model is
100% asymmetric: any redundant interaction loss after duplication is lost
from the progeny protein. The Vazquez at al. model employs symmetric
subfunctionalization: any lost redundant interactions are selected from either
the progenitor or progeny protein with equal probability.

3 RESULTS

The topological properties of both the empirically derived yeast
network and other networks can be found in Table 1. The top row
of the table covers the empirical dataset. Additional datasets can be
found in the Supplementary Materials. The bottom half of the table
contains the topological properties of various theoretical models that
are described later in the text. The ‘Order’ and ‘Size’ columns refer
to the number of proteins and interactions, respectively. ‘Triangles’
and ‘Connected Triples’ refer to the components of the clustering
coefﬁcient. The clustering coefﬁcient is deﬁned as C = g, where
T is the number of triangles and F is the number of connected
triples. A triangle is three fully connected nodes and a connected
triple is a node connected to an unordered pair of other nodes (i.e. a
path of length 2) (Newman, 2001). The clustering coefﬁcient is the
primary measure we use to scrutinize these models. It is a uniquely
appropriate measure because it is sensitive to the model mechanics
we study. The gain of interactions with each duplication, the loss of
interactions as interactions are subfunctionalized, and the paralogous
interactions formed between duplicates each have a measurable
effect on the clustering coefﬁcient (Gibson and Goldberg, 2009a).
Additional topological measures can be found in the Supplementary
Materials.

3.1 Clustering landscape

In order to identify the ﬁill range of clustering coefﬁcients the
Vazquez et al. model can generate, we constructed a heatmap from
networks generated from a wide range of parameter values (Fig. 2).
Full details of its construction are in the Methods of Supplementary
Material. Figure 2 shows the clustering coefﬁcients which are

Topological properties related to the clustering coefﬁcient are shown for the empirical data described in the Supplementary Materials. The large component of the combined data
are also shown. The bottom rows feature mean values for 1000 runs of four models of protein interaction network evolution. The Asym- rows are the modiﬁed Vazquez et al. model
at 82 and 91% asymmetric subfunctionalization. Percentages in parentheses are the proportion of the empirical dataset for the given value. C of RE is the clustering coefﬁcient
of each network’s random equivalent (see Methods of Supplementary Material). The Size (number of interactions) provides a comparative measure of the average degree since all
networks in the table are of the same order. The degree distribution difference is the square root of the sum of squared degree difference between the empirical dataset and each of
the theoretical models. A plot of the network degree distributions can be found in Supplementary Figure 3.

possible using the Vazquez et al. model. The ﬁgure’s 0.15 contour
line is a close approximation to the 0.148 clustering coefﬁcient of
the empirical dataset (Table 1). The contour line indicates that a
wide range of parameter values achieve the empirical clustering.

3.2 Vazquez et al. model and variants

Vazquez et al. (2003) assigned parameter values q=0.7
(subfunctionalization) and p = 0.1 (heteromerization) to their model
(see Supplementary Materials). These parameter values produce a
clustering coefﬁcient of 0.039 (green point in Fig. 2). When the
Vazquez et al. model is initialized to the measures derived in
Section 2.1 (p=0.24,q=0.887,order=2647), the model generates
networks with a mean clustering coefﬁcient of 0.108. The blue
point in Figure 2 identiﬁes where this result falls in the clustering
landscape of the model. The model’s clustering coefﬁcient is

distinctly lower than the empirical network clustering coefﬁcient
of 0.148 (see Table 1).

Protein interaction networks have high clustering coefﬁcients
relative to random equivalent networks (Goldberg and Roth,
2003; 5016 et al., 2002; Wagner, 2001). A necessary criterion of
equivalency is that the random network maintain the same size (i.e.
number of interactions) as the empirical network under study. In
the absence of this equivalency restriction, a randomly generated
network could engineer any clustering coefﬁcient by simply varying
its size. By extension, models of network evolution boasting high
clustering coefﬁcients should also be evaluated on the size of the
generated network.

Using the empirically derived parameter estimates, the Vazquez
et al. model generates a mean size of 1845. This is only 34% of
the 5449 interactions in the empirical network. This low number
is also reﬂected in the triangles and triples which comprise the
clustering coefﬁcient. The model produces a mean of 44 triangles
and 1477 triples which is a small fraction of the 3299 triangles and
66 799 triples in the empirical network. It should be noted, however,
that although the model’s clustering coefﬁcient is low relative to
the empirical data, the model’s clustering is still high relative to a
random network with an equivalent number of interactions.

The gray band in Figure 2 shows those parameter values which
produce networks with sizes within 10% of the empirical network’s
5449 interactions. Those Vazquez et al. parameter values achieving
a similar clustering coefﬁcient and size are quite different from
the empirical values. In particular, Vazquez et al. requires a
subfunctionalization rate half of the empirical rate in order to achieve
a similar size and clustering coefﬁcient.

3.3 Heritable homomers

The results from modifying the Vazquez et al. (2003) model to
support heritable homomers (see Section 2) are shown in Table 1.
Interestingly, this model actually produces lower clustering than the
original Vazquez et al. model. This can be attributed to the rate
at which paralogous interactions are formed. Duplication events
which produce paralogous interactions generate a greater increase
in clustering coefﬁcient over duplication events without paralogous
interactions (Gibson and Goldberg, 2009a). While the original model
adds paralogous interactions with a ﬁxed probability after each

duplication, the heritable homomers model probabilistically adds
paralogous interactions only if the duplication event involves a
homomeric protein. The heritable homomers model produces a
higher clustering coefﬁcient with early duplication events, but as
the network grows, the proportion of homomeric proteins in the
network shrinks and the original model overtakes it in the number
of paralogous interactions formed (See Supplementary Fig. 4). This
is evident by observing that only 16% of the proteins in the empirical
data are homomeric, while the calculated paralogous interaction
rate for the original Vazquez model is 0.24. One explanation
for this large discrepancy is the underreporting of homomeric
interactions by large-scale assays (Gibson and Goldberg, 2009a). If
a larger proportion of self-interacting proteins were identiﬁed in the
empirical data, the Heritable homomers model would begin with
a higher density of self-interactions which in turn would produce
a higher clustering coefﬁcient (see Seed Graph Construction in
Methods of Supplementary Material).

3.4 Asymmetry

Supplemental Figure 2 shows how the clustering landscape changes
when we modify the Vazquez et al. model to accommodate an
empirically derived subﬁinctionalization asymmetry of 82% (see
Methods of Supplementary Material). A comparison between panes
A and B in the supplementary ﬁgure shows that asymmetric
subﬁinctionalization produces higher clusterings for all parameter
values.

Table 1 shows the topological properties for the Vazquez model
variant run at 82% asymmetry. The topological properties indicate
that introducing asymmetry improves the ability of the model to
approach the properties of the empirical network (Table 1). However,
the asymmetry modiﬁcation still only generates half of the edges of
the empirical data and less than 10% of the empirical triangles and
triples.

Increasing subfunctionalization asymmetry also drives the
number of components produced in the network to be more similar
to that of empirical networks and is discussed in detail in the
Supplementary Materials.

3.5 iSite model

Using the empirically derived network measures (Section 2.1), the
iSite model generates networks with remarkable ﬁdelity to the
empirical network. Table 1 shows the mean topological values for
100 runs of the model. The iSite network size (number of edges)
is within 2% of empirical. The clustering coefﬁcient is greater than
empirical: 0.162 versus 0.148, but is closer to empirical than other
models. The iSite model produces roughly half of the triangles and
triples observed in the empirical network. Though the triangle and
triple counts are lower than the empirical values, they represent a
large increase over the few triangles and triples produced by the
Vazquez et al. model and variants.

One notable side effect of the iSite model is that it is highly
asymmetric, even if subﬁinctionalization is symmetric (discussed
in Section 4.2). If iSites are subfunctionalized symmetrically,
interactions are lost with 91% asymmetry versus 82% in the
empirical network. The topological properties for the modiﬁed
Vazquez et al. model at 91% asymmetry are listed in Table 1. This
increased asymmetry improves its clustering topology over other

Vazquez et al. variants, but still lags signiﬁcantly far behind both
the empirical data and the iSite model.

An iSite variant which silences all interactions of a selected
iSite with probability q produces almost complete networks and
is discussed in the Supplementary Materials.

4 DISCUSSION

We have presented an alternative method of calculating model
parameters which take into consideration the effect concurrent and
subsequent duplications have on the model calculation. Now we
discuss the advantages of our parameter estimation methodology
over previous approaches. We also take a ﬁirther look at the model
improvements integrated into the iSite model, and how it compares
to the empirical network.

4.1 Parameter estimation by network counts

The subﬁinctionalization rate is the proportion of redundant
interactions lost between gene duplicates, and can be measured as the
number of interacting neighbors not shared by both gene duplicates
versus the total number of neighbors the duplicates interact with.
Previously, shared (or distinct) interacting neighbors of gene
duplicates have been averages of per-duplicate-pair tallies computed
on empirically derived, extant, protein interaction networks (Beltrao
and Serrano, 2007; Berg et al., 2004; Chung et al., 2006;
He and Zhang, 2005; Wagner, 2001, 2002, 2003). Our whole-
network approach is superior to the per-pair tally approach to ﬁnding
the mean shared (or distinct) neighbors in three ways.

First, as network measures, each interaction (redundant, or
lost) is given equal weight in the network regardless of the
degree of the two proteins forming the interaction. This advantage
parallels that of computing the clustering coefﬁcient as a
network measure (Newman, 2001). The original deﬁnition of the
clustering coefﬁcient calculated an average of each network node’s
neighborhood density (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). This per-node
measure diminishes the clustering contribution of large degree nodes
and is not well deﬁned for nodes with degree :1.

Second, the network rate avoids complexities involving
concurrent duplication. When the neighbor of a paralogous pair
duplicates, there is ambiguity in assigning ‘ownership’ of the edge.
That is, if an interaction between a paralogous pair member and
one of the duplicated neighbors is lost, does the loss contribute to
the subfunctionalization rate of the paralogous pair, the neighbor
pair or both? Our network subfunctionalization rate calculation is
indifferent to interaction ‘ownership’.

Third, paralogous families born of more than one duplication
event within a phylogenetic time period complicate efforts to group
paralogs into pairs. In contrast to previous efforts which limited
paralogy identiﬁcation to pairwise relationships (Lynch and Conery,
2000), we incorporate multiple duplications intrinsic to large gene
families. For each discernible time period, we measure differences
in edge counts for the entire network before any duplications, after
all duplications and after all subfunctionalization (Section 2.1).
Supplementary Figure 6 illustrates the sensitivity of the measured
subfunctionalization rate to the order in which the duplication events
are selected. Our network measure avoids this sensitivity, evaluating
all duplications simultaneously.

Improving evolutionary models of protein interaction networks

 

The pairwise measure also underestimates the number of potential
paralogous interactions in large paralogous families. Multiple
simultaneous duplications occurring in a gene family form a clique
within self-interacting gene families (Supplementary Fig. 7). For
d concurrent gene family duplications, pairwise enumeration of
paralogous edges can identify at most d potential paralogous

d(d+1)

interactions versus the 2 generated via clique creation.

4.2 iSites and domains

There is a strong semantic relationship between protein domains
and interaction sites (iSites). Protein domains are evolutionarily
conserved portions of a protein’s sequence or structure, and are
associated with protein function. Similarly, iSites are evolutionarily
conserved protein subunits, and the interactions that deﬁne them are
analogous to protein function.

A current limitation of the iSite model is in the distribution of
iSite counts in the model’s network of proteins. Empirically, the
majority of eukaryotic proteins have more than one domain (Apic
et al., 2001). The iSite model is initialized with one iSite per
interaction per protein in the seed graph. Given the Erd6s-Renyi
random seed graph used, the distribution of iSites on each protein
at model initiation is Poisson distributed (l=3.33). (A scale-free
seed graph produces comparable results and is covered in the
Supplementary Materials.) Using empirical values derived from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (as in Table 1), the iSite model produces
proteins predominantly (89%) composed of a single iSite, despite
starting with 13% single iSite proteins in the seed graph. Two-
and three-iSite proteins comprise 10% of proteins and greater
iSite concentrations comprise the remaining 1%. This is in stark
contrast to the 22% of single-domain proteins observed in a study
of S.cerevisiae SCOP domain distributions (Apic et al., 2001).
A more recent study examining both sequence- and structure-
based domains achieved higher coverage of domain assignments to
proteins and identiﬁed a greater proportion of single-domain proteins
(35%) (Ekman et al., 2005), though this is still far less than produced
by the iSite model. The propensity of the model to regress to single
iSite proteins is a side-effect of subﬁinctionalization. Supplementary
Figure 8 shows how subﬁinctionalization reduces the number of
multiple-iSite proteins.

A partial explanation for the discrepancy is that iSites are
analogous to actively interacting domains, whereas domain
assignments are based on similarity measures without regard to
whether the domain’s functionality has been partially or wholly
silenced. In the model, an iSite which has lost all interactions
is simply removed. Evolutionary phenomena unaccounted for in
the model such as gene ﬁision and gene ﬁssion likely contribute
to the discrepancy between the iSite model and empirical data.
Compounding the difﬁculty in associating interactions with domains
are interactions which may be detected by assays such as yeast two-
hybrid but are not necessarily associated with speciﬁc domains such
as phosphorylation-dependent protein interactions (Shaywitz et al.,
2002).

The model could also be improved by encouraging the distribution
of iSites to more closely reﬂect that of domains observed in empirical
data. The degeneration of multi-iSite proteins to single iSites as
illustrated in Supplementary Figure 8 is a symptom of iSites within
a protein being independent. A method encouraging multiple iSites

of a single protein to remain together could mitigate the degeneration
of multi-iSite proteins.

An important improvement over the Vazquez et al. model is
in the heteromerization parameter—the probability of adding an
interaction between gene duplicates. The iSite model repurposes
it from probabilistic paralogous edge addition to a parameter
representing selection pressure operating on heritable interactions.
Notably, this closely parallels the Heritable homomers modiﬁcation
that was made to the original Vazquez et al. model. Despite this
similarity, the iSite model achieves a high clustering coefﬁcient
unattainable by the original Vazquez model and its variants. The
high clustering can be attributed to the rapid increase of interactions
within iSites coupled with paralogous interactions. The iSite is
the unit of redundancy subject to subﬁinctionalization (versus the
original Vazquez model and its variants where each interaction
is independently redundant). Because of this, upon duplication all
interactions within each iSite will survive unchanged in either the
progeny or progenitor. This concentrates interactions more quickly
than the original Vazquez model. It is paralogous interactions which
then provide the greatest contribution to high clustering (Gibson
and Goldberg, 2009a). As paralogous interactions form among the
more highly concentrated interactions within iSites, a high clustering
coefﬁcient is generated.

5 CONCLUSION

We have developed an improved methodology for estimating link
dynamics rates based on empirical network data. Estimating rates
through simple examination of the empirical network fails to account
for the entire evolutionary history of interaction addition and loss
which underlie the extant network. Our methodology attempts
to ‘peel back’ more recent duplication events in order to more
accurately assess link dynamics associated with older duplication
events. Using our empirically derived rates, the Vazquez et al. model
fails to achieve empirical clustering. A modiﬁed model integrating
heritable interaction sites generates networks with clustering more
closely approximating the yeast network.

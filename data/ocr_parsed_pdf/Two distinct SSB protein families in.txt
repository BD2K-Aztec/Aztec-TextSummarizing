ABSTRACT

Motivation: Eukaryote-infecting nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA
viruses (NCLDVs) feature some of the largest genomes in the viral
world. These viruses typically do not strongly depend on the host
DNA replication systems. In line with this observation, a number of
essential DNA replication proteins, such as DNA polymerases,
primases, helicases and ligases, have been identified in the
NCLDVs. One other ubiquitous component of DNA replisomes is the
single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein. lntriguingly, no NCLDV
homologs of canonical OB-fold-containing SSB proteins had previ-
ously been detected. Only in poxviruses, one of seven NCLDV
families, l3 was identified as the SSB protein. However, whether l3
is related to any known protein structure has not yet been established.
Results: Here, we addressed the case of ‘missing’ canonical SSB
proteins in the NCLDVs and also probed evolutionary origins of the
IS family. Using advanced computational methods, in four NCLDV
families, we detected homologs of the bacteriophage T7 SSB protein
(gp2.5). We found the properties of these homologs to be consistent
with the SSB function. Moreover, we implicated specific residues in
single-stranded DNA binding. At the same time, we found no evolu-
tionary link between the T7 gp2.5-like NCLDV SSB homologs and the
poxviral SSB protein (l3). Instead, we identified a distant relationship
between l3 and small protein B (SmpB), a bacterial RNA-binding pro-
tein. Thus, apparently, the NCLDVs have the two major distinct sets of
SSB proteins having bacteriophage and bacterial origins, respectively.

1 INTRODUCTION

The largest currently known Viruses belong to the group of
eukaryotic nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA Viruses (NCLDVs)
(Iyer et al., 2001; Koonin and Yutin, 2010). At present, this
group of double-stranded DNA Viruses is classiﬁed into seven
families (Boyer et al., 2009). Replication of these large Viruses
typically does not strongly depend on the host DNA replication
and transcription systems. In line with the large genome size and
the relative replication independence, comparative genomics stu-
dies revealed that NCLDV genomes encode essential DNA rep-
lication proteins, including DNA polymerase, helicase and
primase (Iyer et al., 2006; Yutin et al., 2009).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

However, conspicuously absent among the identiﬁed conserved
NCLDV protein families Wutin et al., 2009) were canonical
single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) proteins. The SSB function
in nature is strongly associated with the speciﬁc structural solu-
tion, oligonucleotide-binding (OB) fold, featuring a ﬁve-stranded
ﬂ-barrel capped with an a-helix (Murzin, 1993). To our know-
ledge, there are only two documented exceptions, where the struc-
ture of an SSB protein is unrelated to OB-fold. The two exceptions
include adenovirus (Tucker et al., 1994) and Thermoproteales, a
clade of hyperthermophilic Crenarchaea (Paytubi et al., 2012).

Given the importance of SSB proteins in various DNA trans-
actions, the seeming absence of canonical OB-fold SSB proteins
in NCLDV genomes was all the more intriguing. Although in
poxviruses, one of seven NCLDV families, the SSB protein (13)
has been identified (Gammon and Evans, 2009), whether it is
based on the OB-fold or some unrelated structure has not yet
been established (Greseth et al., 2012).

In this study, we aimed to resolve the puzzle of ‘missing’
canonical OB-fold SSB proteins in the NCLDVs and to explore
the evolutionary origins of the enigmatic poxviral SSB protein
family.

2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

2.1 Four NCLDV families have canonical OB-fold
SSB proteins

We started by testing the hypothesis that NCLD Viruses do pos-
sess classical OB-fold-containing SSB proteins, but with strongly
diverged sequences. To this end, we performed iterative sequence
searches with PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) and jackhmmer
(Eddy, 2011). Searches were run against the nr70 sequence data-
base (the NCBI non-redundant database ﬁltered at 70% identity)
using the E—Value = 0.001 inclusion threshold and
well-characterized SSB proteins from both cellular organisms
and Viruses as queries (see Supplementary Material for more
details on Methods). To our surprise, when we used the T7 bac-
teriophage SSB protein (gp2.5) sequence (gi: 9627442) as a query,
we detected statistically signiﬁcant matches (E—Value<0.001) in
four NCLDV families (Phycodnaviridae, M imiviridae,
Iridoviridae and Marseillevirus). We scrutinized this finding by
testing whether these putative NCLDV SSB homologs are able
to detect T7 SSB in a reverse search. For this test, we used
HHsearch (Soding, 2005), a sensitive method based on compari-
son of sequence proﬁles. We generated sequence proﬁles for sev-
eral newly identiﬁed putative NCLDV SSB proteins and queried
them against profile databases. Searches against the sequence

proﬁle database derived from known structures (PDB) readily
identified T7 gp2.5 with highly significant HHsearch probabil-
ities (>95%). Same queries against the Pfam protein family data-
base detected two families annotated as domains of unknown
function (DUFs). One of them (DUF2738) is a self-detection,
whereas another family (DUF2815) comprises T7 gp2.5-like se-
quences, originating mainly from prophages (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Taken together, these results provide convincing evi-
dence that four NCLDV families encode T7-like SSB homologs.
The detected relationship is not only reliable, but also speciﬁc
because of distinct features of the T7 gp2.5 OB-fold domain. In
T7 gp2.5, the capping ai-helix is inserted between strands [32 and
[33 in contrast to its typical position between [33 and [34.

In some NCLDV genomes, we detected more than one T7 SSB
homolog (Supplementary Table S1). In most such cases, SSB
orthologs were identiﬁed straightforwardly based on their group-
ing by sequence similarity using CLANS (Frickey and Lupas,
2004). The ubiquitous presence of the C-terminal tail enriched in
acidic residues emerged as an additional deﬁning feature of
orthologs. It is known that the acidic C-terminal tail of T7
gp2.5 is the site of interaction for multiple proteins involved in
DNA transactions (Marintcheva et ai., 2006). The functional role
of paralogs is not clear, but one of the possibilities is that they are
involved in the formation of an oligomeric SSB structure.
Oligomeric structures represent a functional form of SSB pro-
teins in organisms as diverse as T7 bacteriophage, Escherichia
coii and humans (Bochkareva et ai., 2002; Kim and Richardson,
1994; Raghunathan et ai., 1997).

One of the phycodnaviruses [Emiliania huxieyi Virus 86
(EhV86)], in addition to strongly diverged T7 SSB-like protein
(Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1), has two homologs of
eukaryotic/archaeal SSB (replication protein A). The T7
gp2.5-like protein in EhV86 is most distant among the corres-
ponding homologs in other phycodnaviruses, suggesting that
there may be a certain functional interplay between the
gp2.5-like protein and replication protein A homologs.

The EhV86 case notwithstanding, the identiﬁed relationship
between putative NCLDV SSB proteins and T7 gp2.5 suggests

their similar role in DNA replication and recombination. This
notion is strengthened by the genomic context. We noticed that
frequently putative NCLDV SSB proteins are encoded in the
Vicinity of proteins involved in DNA replication and recombin-
ation, such as DNA polymerases, helicases, topoisomerases,
clamp and clamp loader subunits. Moreover, transcriptomics
data indicate that putative SSB genes in Frog Virus 3
(Iridoviridae), PBCV-l (Phycodnaviridae) and Mimivirus are ac-
tively expressed early in the infection, together with DNA repli-
cation components (Legendre et ai., 2010; Majji et ai., 2009;
Yanai-Balser et ai., 2010).

2.2 Structure of NCLDV SSB proteins is consistent with
the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) -binding function

To get a further insight regarding structure and function of pu-
tative NCLDV SSB proteins, we constructed a homology model
for a representative (gi: 340025795) from the phycodnavirus
PBCV-l. The model was built using iterative optimization of
both the sequenceistructure alignment and the set of protein
structures used as modeling templates (V enclovas and
Margeleviéius, 2009). The initial PBCV-l SSB model was con-
structed using the crystal structure of T7 gp2.5 (PDB: 1je5) as the
single template. However, our analysis suggested that the cap-
ping a-helix (ail in T7 gp2.5; Fig. 1) and the adjacent region of
PBCV-l SSB might be more similar to the corresponding
OB-domain substructure of the herpesviral SSB protein (ICP8,
PDB: lurj; Supplementary Fig. S2). Indeed, the combination of
T7 and herpesviral SSB structures led to a substantial improve-
ment. According to the energy estimation with ProSA-web
(Wiederstein and Sippl, 2007), the final PBCV-l SSB model
(available at: http://www.ibt.lt/bioinformatics/models/pbcv1_
ssb/) fared better than the T7 gp2.5 structure, for which missing
loops were modeled in before the evaluation. Prosa Z—score
values were —7.34 for the PBCV-l SSB model and —6.96 for
T7 gp2.5 (more negative values imply a more energetically favor-
able structure). Thus, evaluation results suggested that the model
is likely to be sufﬁciently accurate for the exploration of func-
tional properties.

(C) Cartoon representation of the model with labeled residues shown
as sticks

To see whether the modeled PBCV-l SSB structure indeed is
suggestive of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding, we
examined its surface properties (Fig. 2). Consistent with the pre-
dicted ssDNA-binding function, we observed an increased posi-
tive electrostatic potential in the region, which is thought to bind
ssDNA in T7 gp2.5 (Hyland et ai., 2003). Moreover, we estab-
lished that the same PBCV-l SSB surface region features some of
the highest evolutionary conservation (Fig. 2B). Based on the
conservation and/or electrostatic properties, we identiﬁed four
residues that are most likely to participate in the ssDNA binding
(Figs 1 and 2).

The involvement of at least two of these residues in ssDNA
binding is supported by experimental studies of T7 and herpes-
viral SSB proteins. Suid herpes Virus SSB K756 corresponding to
PBCV-l SSB K139 is critical for ssDNA binding (Wu et ai.,
2009), while the point mutation of respective T7 2.5 residue
(K109I) alters the ssDNA-binding mode (Hyland et ai., 2003).
The Y158C point mutation renders T7 SSB defective in ssDNA
binding (Hyland et ai., 2003), presumably by disrupting the
stacking interaction with a nucleotide base. Consistent with
such a role, the corresponding position in NCLDV SSB proteins
(W182 in PBCV-l SSB) is occupied exclusively by aromatic resi-
dues. The SSB protein of Suid herpes Virus also has an aromatic
residue 0(971) in this position. Although the importance of Y971
has not been addressed directly, the mutation of adjacent lysine
(K970) significantly affected ssDNA binding (Wu et ai., 2009).
The importance of the remaining two positions in NCLDV SSB
proteins (K141 and R194 in PBCV-l) has no experimental sup-
port coming from either T7 or herpesviral SSBs. However, their
location within the putative ssDNA-binding cleft and a fairly
strong conservation suggest a likely role in ssDNA binding.

2.3 Poxviral SSB proteins (the 13 family) are
evolutionary distinct

In poxviruses, we did not detect either T7 gp2.5-like or any other
OB-fold-containing SSB homolog. On the other hand, vaccinia

Virus, the prototypic poxvirus, has long been known to encode
the ssDNA-binding protein, named I3 (Rochester and
Traktman, 1998). Several reports have provided convincing evi-
dence that I3 is the replicative SSB protein and a major player in
Viral DNA recombination (Gammon and Evans, 2009; Greseth
et ai., 2012). However, despite extensive efforts, no relationship
between I3 and any other protein family could be established
(Greseth et ai., 2012).

To search for homologous proteins related to the I3 family, we
first performed standard PSI-BLAST and jackhmmer runs
(up to ﬁve iterations, inclusion E—Value= 0.001) against the
nr70 sequence database using representative I3 sequences as
queries. However, these searches revealed no statistically signiﬁ-
cant matches outside of the I3 family. To increase sensitivity, we
performed the same searches with the more permissive E—Value
inclusion threshold (0.01). This time, jackhmmer (but not
PSI-BLAST) readily detected small protein B (SmpB) sequences
as signiﬁcant matches. To test whether the I3 alignment with
SmpB is indicative of true homology or is just a spurious
match, we performed additional analyses. We noticed that only
the central region of I3 sequences was aligned to SmpB. It is
commonly known that sequence segments of low complexity or
unrelated domains may hinder homology detection. Thus, we
reasoned that if I3 and SmpB are homologous, the removal of
unaligned regions of I3 should improve the detection of SmpB.
This indeed turned out to be the case. One of the N- and
C-terminally truncated I3 sequences (Crocodilepox Virus I3; gi:
115531731) in the jackhmmer search was now able to detect
SmpB using a more stringent inclusion threshold
(E-Value = 0.001).

Next, we performed homology searches using HHsearch.
Initially, we generated proﬁles based on representative full-length
I3 sequences and queried them against the PDB-derived proﬁle
database. HHsearch detected SmpB from Aquifex aeoiicus (PDB:
1p6V) as the best match. The most signiﬁcant results (HHsearch
probability=89%) were obtained using the Yoka poxvirus I3
(gi: 345107239) proﬁle. This result alone would not be considered
entirely reliable. However, HHsearch and jackhmmer returned
essentially identical alignments for the same central region of I3
(Fig. 3). Moreover, when we ran queries with profiles based on
truncated I3 sequences, HHsearch results in detecting SmpB
have improved further, reaching the 95% probability (e.g. I3;
gi: 41057468). As an additional test, we performed searches in
the reverse direction using SmpB proﬁles as queries against the
Pfam profile database. HHsearch did identify poxviral I3 proﬁle
as the best match (disregarding self-match to SmpB), but with
the insufﬁcient conﬁdence (probability=90%). Again, if only
the aligned region of SmpB was used, HHsearch was able to
detect the I3 family with the highly signiﬁcant 95% probability
(SmpB; gi: 240047684). Collectively, all these homology search
results strongly suggest common ancestry for I3 and SmpB
families.

SmpB is a bacterial protein that binds tmRNA, a hybrid RNA
molecule having functions of both transfer RNA and messenger
RNA. SmpB adopts a distinct structural fold with no significant
similarity to any other structures (Dong et ai., 2002). Despite
that, SmpB was proposed to contain an ‘embedded’ OB-fold
(Dong et al., 2002), a proposition that appears to be misleading.
Our analysis revealed that the SmpB structure is a bona fide

duplication of the ﬂaﬂﬂ structural motif (Supplementary Fig.
S3). Thus, the pseudosymmetric SmpB structure, made of two
consecutive repeats, is in stark contrast to the repeat-free asym-
metric OB-fold.

Interestingly, only the second SmpB repeat is aligned with I3
in its entirety (Fig. 3), suggesting its stronger evolutionary con-
servation. Consistent with this notion, the aligned regions of
both SmpB and I3 harbor a number of functionally important
residues (Greseth et ai., 2012; Gutmann et ai., 2003). The central
SmpB-like region of I3 is followed by the C-terminus, enriched in
aspartates and glutamates and predicted to feature a significant
intrinsic disorder. In this regard, the I3 C-terminus is reminiscent
of unstructured acidic tails involved in proteiniprotein inter-
actions in canonical bacterial and phage SSB proteins.

2.4 Taxonomic distribution of NCLDV SSBs and its
evolutionary implications

We mapped the resulting distribution of NCLDV SSB proteins

onto the consensus phylogenetic tree of NCLD Viruses (Fig. 4).

As NCLDVs are thought to be monophyletic (Iyer et ai., 2001),

the distribution is suggestive of T7-like SSB being already present

in the ancestral Virus. This is consistent with the idea that

bacteriophages played an important role in the early NCLDV
evolution (Iyer et ai., 2001, 2006; Koonin and Yutin, 2010).
Indeed, many of NCLDV genes essential for genome replication
(DNA primase-helicase, NAD-dependent ligase and Holliday
junction resolvase) show bacteriophage origins (Koonin and
Yutin, 2010). Our newly detected T7 gp2.5-like protein family
is yet another addition to this list. On the other hand, the unre-
lated I3 family, conﬁned to poxviruses, is likely the result of a
more recent non-orthologous replacement event.

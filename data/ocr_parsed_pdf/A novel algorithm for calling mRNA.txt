Abstract

Motivation: NE—methyl—adenosine (mBA) is the most prevalent mRNA methylation but precise pre—
diction of its mRNA location is important for understanding its function. A recent sequencing tech—
nology, known as Methylated RNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing technology (MeRlP—seq), has
been developed for transcriptome—wide profiling of mBA. We previously developed a peak calling
algorithm called exomePeak. However, exomePeak over—simplifies data characteristics and ignores
the reads’ variances among replicates or reads dependency across a site region. To further im—
prove the performance, new model is needed to address these important issues of MeRlP—seq
data.

Results: We propose a novel, graphical model—based peak calling method, MeTPeak, for
transcriptome—wide detection of mBA sites from MeRlP—seq data. MeTPeak explicitly models read
count of an m6A site and introduces a hierarchical layer of Beta variables to capture the variances
and a Hidden Markov model to characterize the reads dependency across a site. In addition, we de—
veloped a constrained Newton’s method and designed a log—barrier function to compute analytic—
ally intractable, positively constrained Beta parameters. We applied our algorithm to simulated and
real biological datasets and demonstrated significant improvement in detection performance and
robustness over exomePeak. Prediction results on publicly available MeRlP—seq datasets are also
validated and shown to be able to recapitulate the known patterns of mBA, further validating the im—
proved performance of MeTPeak.

Availability and implementation: The package 'MeTPeak’ is implemented in R and C++, and add—
itional details are available at https://github.com/compgenomics/MeTPeak

1 Introduction

 

Compared with DNA methylation, which is a well—established and
extensively studied epigenetic phenomenon, m6A methylation in
mRNA is still largely an uncharted territory. Recent surge of interest
comes mainly as a result of two groundbreaking studies (Dominissini
et 111., 2012; Meyer et 111., 2012) that show high abundancy of m6A in
>25% of transcripts in human and mouse cells. A number of

subsequent studies have provided significant insights into the mechan—
ism as well as the functions of mRNA m6A methylation. It is known
now that the m6A methyltransferase complex, or the m6A writer,
consists of Wilms’ tumor 1—ass0ciating protein (WTAP),
methyltransferase—like 3 (METTL3) and methyltransferase—like 14
(METTL14) (Liu et (11., 2014; Nilsen, 2014; Wang et (11., 2014b).
Different from DNA methylation, m6A methylation is reversible and

can be removed by m6A demethylase, or m6A erasers, such as the fat
mass— and obesity—associated protein (PTO) (Fu et (11., 2014; Meyer
et (11., 2012). In addition, the YTH protein domain functions as an
m6A reader that recruits the binding of the m6A methyltransferase to
mRNA (Wang et 111., 20143). The mRNA m6A methylation has been
shown to play a role in mRNA stability, processing and translational
efficiency (Alarcon et (11., 2015; Niu et (11., 2013). These recent ad—
vances notwithstanding, the fact of wide—spread m6A in transcriptome
suggests that m6A is potential involved in many other unknown biolo—
gical processes.

These recent breakthroughs of m6A are largely attributed to the
development of the Methylated RNA Immunoprecipitation
Sequencing technology, or MeRIP—seq (also known as ‘m6A—seq’),
which is designed to profile transcriptome—wide m6A sites. MeRIP—
seq is technically a synthesis of two well—established methods: chro—
matin immunoprecipitation sequencing (Kidder et (11., 2011) and
RNA sequencing (RNA—seq) (Garber et (11., 2011). In MeRIP—seq,
mRNAs are first fragmented into approximately 100—nucleotide—
long fragments. A large portion of the fragments are immunopreci—
pitated by anti—m6A antibody and subsequently measured by high—
throughput sequencing to form Immunoprecipitation Sequencing
(IP) samples. In addition, input samples, which are used to measure
the background mRNA abundance for the IP experiments, are gen—
erated by sequencing the un—immunoprecipitated mRNA fragments.
To predict m6A sites, the IP and input reads are aligned to the tran—
scriptome and the reads enrichment of IP over the combined reads in
IP and input are assessed.

To meet the computational needs for MeRIP—seq—based m6A
peak detection, we previously developed the exomePeak R package
(Meng et (11., 2014). Basically, exomePeak calculates the overall
methylation degree by dividing the IP reads by the sum of IP and
input reads. Given the hypothesis that all the IP reads at a particu—
lar location follow the same Binomial distribution, parameterized
by the overall methylation degree, exomePeak computes a C test
(Przyborowski and Wilenski, 1940) to determine the methylation
sites. Although exomePeak could achieve fairly robust m6A detec—
tion, there are still two major limitations. First, exomePeak does
not model the reads variance within transcripts and across repli—
cates. Usually, highly fluctuating read enrichments can be observed
around an m6A site and in MeRIP—seq replicates. However,
exomePeak assumes that the site regions share the same reads en—
richment. Second, exomePeak ignores the dependency of reads en—
richment along the mRNA transcripts and therefore could miss the
true peaks with low enrichment or erroneously predict the noisy
outlier as true peaks. To address these issues, we introduce in this
article a new algorithm, MeTPeak. MeTPeak deploys a hierarch—
ical beta—binomial model to model the variance of reads enrich—
ment and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to account for the
dependency of neighboring enrichment. MeTPeak is an open—
source R package, where core heavy computation part of the algo—
rithm is written in C ++.

2 Methods

2.1 Graphical representation of MeTPeak

MeTPeak detects m6A peaks on each gene separately, where a par—
ticular gene is first divided into N mutually connected bins whose
length is equal to the sequencing fragment L, MeTPeak models the
reads dependency of the continuous bins by an HMM and the reads
count in each bin by the mixture of Beta—binomial distribution. Now

2.2 Sites detection and parameter inference

Identifying methylation sites requires inferring the hidden methyla—
tion status variable Z and the model parameters (9. However,
given the non—linearity of the likelihood function (5), no closed—
form solution for the maximum likelihood estimators can be ob—
tained. Alternatively, we turn to the expectation maximization
(EM) framework for a numerical solution (Lindstrom and Bates,
1988). Furthermore, as the parameters for Beta—binomial distribu—
tion [01,11] are constrained to be positive, we device a barrier func—
tion and propose a constrained maximization procedure to achieve
that goal.

The EM algorithm estimates Z and (9 in an iterative fashion,
where each iteration consists of an E step and an M step. In the E
step, the posterior distributions of Z given an initial estimate or the
previously computed parameters 0"” is calculated. To do so, the
joint marginal P (Zn, X) is first computed through the forward—back—
ward recursion algorithm (Supplementary Equation (9—11)), from
which the conditional posterior distributions P(Z,,)X, 0"”) and
P (Zn_1 , ZnX, 0"”) can be subsequently obtained.

In the M step, a new estimate of 0"” is obtained through maxi—
mizing Q(®, 0"”), which is a lower bound of l in (5) and has the
expression

where q(Z) is a shorthand expression of P(Z)X,0"M). Among (9,
closed—form expressions can be obtained for [An] and the detailed
derivations are provided in Supplementary (S14—S17). However, be—
cause the derivative of Q(®,®°ld) w.r.t. [01,11] has no closed form
and [or,ﬂ]are constrained to be positive, an estimate of [01,11] cannot
be computed directly. To address this difficulty, we propose a con—
strained Newton’s method, whose optimization objective is formu—
lated as

equality constrains. To constrain A > 0 as desired, la is set to zero

and F and lo are the coefficients for the in—

and F is set to a diagonal matrix with —1s as the diagonal elements;
however, this general inequality constrain formulation allows inclu—
sion of any linear constrains such as an upper limit on [01,11]. The

basic idea to solve (7) is to use a logarithmic barrier to make the in—

equality constrain implicit, i.e.

3 Results

3.1 Performance evaluation by simulation

We started by first evaluating the performance of the proposed con—
strained Newton’s method for estimating the parameters [01,11] by
examining the goodness—of—fit to the mixture of Beta—binomials dis—
tribution. The results showed that MeTPeak can accurately fit the
mixture under a variety of variance conditions (Supplementary Fig.
S1). Then, we assessed the performance of MeTPeak using the simu—
lated MeRIP—seq dataset where the true methylation sites were
known according to the proposed generative model described in
Section 2.1. The reads for each gene were simulated independently,
where the count for each bin was generated according to the HMM—
based Beta—binomial model. To obtain proper parameters for 01 and
1)’ that mimic the methylation sites, we examined the genes with
methylation degree 17,, and fitted the Beta distributions from a real
MeRIP—seq case—control study as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2.
The estimated parameters for the site region was [011,131] : [6,2],
with the mean of methylation degree 17,,,,,,,, : 0.75, the parameters
for non—peak region were set to [012, [7’2] : [1, 5], and the proportion
weight for the peak versus non—peak region was set
to w : [0.3, 0.7]. For each of the following experiments, MeRIP—seq
reads of 1000 genes with methylation sites were simulated according
to the above—defined parameters. Detection results of both MeTPeak
and exomePeak were obtained and to evaluate the performance,
areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were
obtained for both methods. Unless otherwise specified, two repli—
cates were simulated for each experiment.

3.1. 1 MeTPeak is robust against data variance

We first investigated the detection robustness of MeTPeak by con—
sidering different variances of data because in the real MeRIP—seq
datasets, the reads variation in peak regions across these replicates
can vary dramatically. Particularly, a number of beta distributions
of peak regions with variances designed to range from 0.014 to an
extreme high level 0.134, corresponding to [01,13] : [0.3, 0.1], were
simulated to generate reads, where 17,,,,,,,, : 0.75 was held for each
case. The AUC curves in Fig. 2 show that MeTPeak was highly ro—
bust against the change of variance and achieved close to >95%
AUC even at the highest variance. In contrast, the performance of
exomePeak clearly degraded with variance and at the highest vari—
ance level, it dropped >20% in AUC and more than four times than
MeTPeak. This is because exomePeak assumed that the methylation
degree from all the sites are the same, which obviously violates the
real case of MeRIP—seq data.

3.1.2 MeTPeak is robust for small replicates

We next evaluated the inﬂuence of MeRIP—seq replicates on the de—
tection performance. Usually in the MeRIP—seq experiments, it is
hard to get more than four biological replicates, and robustness
under the condition for small replicates is useful for the peak—calling
algorithms. Simulated data with the number of replicates varying
from 1 to 12 were generated under two variances conditions and re—
sults are shown in Fig. 3. AUCs of both methods increased with the
number of replicates. However, MeTPeak was robust and achieved
about 5% and 10% more AUC than exomePeak even with one repli—
cate at low and high data variance, respectively. In addition, even
under the condition of high data variance, with more than four repli—
cates, MeTPeak could excel the AUC of exomePeak in low data
variance. In contrast, exomePeak can barely reach that of MeTPeak
at high variance despite the increase of replicates. This improvement
of MeTPeak is mainly owing to careful modeling of reads variance
and replicates.

3.1.3 MeTPeak is robust against data outlier

We next considered a specific case in which MeRIP—seq data contain
reads outlier, a scenario where counts in some replicates were sig—
nificantly larger than those in the remaining replicates. In such case,
because exomePeak is likely to produce erroneous predictions be—
cause its decision is based on the average counts of all the replicates,
and the outlier reads could significantly skew the true distribution of
the reads, leading to erroneous predictions. To evaluate the impact
of reads outlier on MeTPeak performance, we simulated a case with
four replicates and three samples were generated with parameter
[01,13] : [6, 2] for the methylation peaks, whereas in the fourth, out—
lier sample, peaks were simulated from different locations and reads
counts in peak regions were made to artificially vary from 1 to 15
times of the averaged counts of peak regions in the other three repli—
cates. As shown in Fig. 4, the performance of exomePeak drops sig—
nificantly with the increase of outlier counts. In contrast, MeTPeak
performance is highly robust (~95 % of AUC) against different lev—
els of outlier.

3.1.4 MeTPeak is sensitive to lowly enriched peaks

Furthermore, we examined the detection sensitivity, especially for
lowly enriched peaks. We simulated the data with varying methyla—
tion degree from a low methylation degree with 17,,,,,,,, : 0.33, to a

highly enriched with 17,,,,,,,,, : 0.89. The result is depicted in Fig. 5
and it demonstrates that at all tested methylation degrees, MeTPeak
outperformed exomePeak for detecting lowly enriched peaks. Even
at an extremely low methylation degree of 17,,,,,,,, : 0.33, a scenario
where the read counts in IP samples are half of that in input samples,
MeTPeak still can achieve >70% AUC, about 5% higher than
exomePeak. This improvement by MeTPeak in detecting lowly en—
riched peaks demonstrates the advantage of modeling the depend—
ency of reads.

3.2 Performance evaluation using real MeRlP—seq
datasets

To further validated MeTPeak, we applied it to real publically avail—
able MeRIP—seq datasets. The first two MeRIP—seq datasets are from
the study of the function of FTO, where FTO is a demethylase that
functions to remove m6A methylation. In this study, FTO was
knocked out from mouse midbrain cells, and the MeRIP—seq data—
sets before (wildtype or WT—FTO) and after knock—out (KO—FTO)
were obtained (Meyer et al., 2012). We should expect an increase of
m6A methylation after FTO knockout. The other four datasets come
from the experiments that studied the roles of the components in
human methyltransferase complex, namely METTL3, METTL14

and WTAP. The datasets include MeRIP—seq samples from the wild—
type HeLa cells (WT—HeLa) and HeLa cells after knocking out each
of the three proteins (KO—METTL3, KO—METTL14 and KO—
WTAP) (Liu et al., 2014). In this case, we should expect a decrease
of m6A methylation in knockout cells. The datasets were down—
loaded from Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession number
GSE47217 for KO—FTO experiment and GSE46705 for the others.
The dataset of WT—FTO (KO—FTO) includes three replicates for
each of WT—FTO IP samples (KO—FTO IP) and WT—FTO input sam—
ples (KO—FTO input). Each dataset of KO—METTL3, KO—
METTL14 and KO—WTAP has two IP and input replicates and WT—
HeLa has four replicates, respectively. For all the samples, reads
were aligned to the corresponding transcriptome (UCSC mm9 or
UCSC hg19) by TopHat2 (Kim et al., 2013). After quality control
(QC > 30), the depth of the samples was normalized to the geomet—
ric mean.

We assessed the prediction specificity of MeTPeak and
exomePeak by evaluating their false positives (FPs), i.e. the percent—
age of falsely detected peaks among all un—methylated peaks. To cal—
culate false—positive rates, we need to know the true unmethylation
peaks, which however were not readily available. To circumvent
this difficulty, we created artificial datasets, where for each dataset,
we replaced input (or IP) samples by a subset of IP (or input) repli—
cate samples and treat them as pseudo input (or IP) samples for a
particular condition WT (or KO). Because the IP and input samples
in each artificial dataset are replicate samples from the same IP (or
input), there should not be any reads enrichment and thus any de—
tected peaks should be FPs. Eight artificial datasets were generated
as WT—FTO IP versus WT—FTO IP, WT—FTO input versus WT—FTO
input, KO—FTO IP versus KO—FTO IP, KO—FTO input versus KO—
FTO input. Each dataset can be manipulated to generate two pseudo
datasets by the strategy of using IP versus IP and input versus input
(i.e. WT—FTO IP versus WT—FTO IP, WT—FTO input versus WT—
FTO input). Therefore, a method has higher specificity if it detects
less number of m6A sites across all these artificial datasets at the
same FDR threshold.

To evaluate the specificity at different detection thresholds, a ser—
ies of FDR thresholds (0.00001—0.1) was evaluated for both
MeTPeak and exomePeak. At a particular FDR, a ratio of FPs (RFP)
was computed as number of FPs by MeTPeak divided by that by
exomePeak. MeTPeak will have higher specificity if RFP < 1. Fig. 6
shows the RFPs for the artificial datasets from WT— (KO—) FTO and
WT— (KO—) METTL14 datasets; the results of the rest datasets can
be found in Supplementary Fig. S3. We can see RFPs are always less
than one for all FDR thresholds in all 12 tested datasets. On aver—
age, MeTPeak has three times less FPs than exomePeak at any given
FDR threshold. For exomePeak, even at FDR threshold of 0.00001,
it still reported about more than 10 times more FPs than MeTPeak
did. These results suggest that MeTPeak has a consistently higher
specificity than exomePeak.

3.3 Prediction results on real MeRlP—seq datasets

After comprehensive evaluation of MeTPeak performance on both
simulation and real datasets, we analyzed the MeTPeak predictions
on those six MeRIP—seq datasets to investigate context—specific and
common characteristics of m6A methylation sites. The results for
WT(KO)—FTO and WT(KO)—HeLa(METTL14) are shown in Fig. 7
(see Supplementary Fig. S4 for results for KO—METTL3 and KO—
WTAP). On average, 13 172 m6A sites were detected by MeTPeak
(FDR < 0.05), whereas the number of detected peaks by exomePeak
is 16 691. Although in all datasets, exomePeak reports more peaks

than MeTPeak, exomePeak commits far more FPs as demonstrated
in Section 3.2. As a result, MeTPeak is likely to produce more reli—
able m6A sites. Besides, we carefully examined the methylation sites
in IGV2.1 (Thorvaldsdottir et al., 2013). We found that some obvi—
ous methylation sites were missed by exomePeak (see gene Tgfbr3 in
Fig. 55), while a lot more unlikely methylated loci were reported as
methylation sites, as the read count was extremely small (see gene

Ccdc60 in Fig. 55). It takes MeTPeak about 3~4 hours to predict
m6A sites for the datasets with three replicates on an ordinary desk—
top (see detailed runtime analysis in Supplementary).

To further validate the methylation sites identified by MeTPeak,
we searched the m6A motif in the sequences of detected peaks. It has
been shown in (Liu et al., 2014) that ‘GGAC’ is the most significant
consensus sequence. Therefore, we extracted the sequences of the
top 5000 most enriched peaks ranked according to FDR for each al—
gorithms using BEDTools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) and searched
‘GGAC’ motif in each one of these sequences, where the distance
from the location of the identified motif to the center of the peak
was computed. The distributions of the distance for WT—FTO and
WT—HeLa are plotted in Fig. 8 (See Supplementary S6 for other
datasets). We can see that the distribution of MeTPeak is peakier,
indicating that ‘GGAC’ motif is closer to the center in the MeTPeak
detected peaks, demonstrating again higher accuracy in the detected
methylation site. Next, we investigated the m6A fold enrichment,
defined as IP reads count divided by input reads count in the peak
region. The distributions of fold enrichment of the identified peaks
are plotted in Fig. 9 and Supplementary Fig. S7. The figures show
that the distribution of fold enrichment for MeTPeak is significantly
higher than that for exomePeak (Welch t—test, P < 2.2e—16). The re—
sults show that MeTPeak is robust to the reads variance and favors
peaks with higher fold enrichment than exomePeak, demonstrating
the advantages of modeling variances for the read counts.

We next examined the shared m6A peaks between WT and KO
conditions in these four MeRIP—seq datasets to evaluate the

enrichment change of the common methylation sites. There are
11 534 common m6A peaks reported by MeTPeak in WT—FTO and
KO—FTO datasets; for KO—METTL14, KO—METTL3 and KO—
WTAP datasets, we found 6170, 8256 and 6067 m6A peaks, re—
spectively. Later, we extracted the fold enrichments for the shared
m6A peaks and differential ratios were computed by using fold en—
richment in the treated condition divided by that in the WT condi—
tion. The boxplots of differential ratios for each group of MeRIP—
seq datasets are shown in Fig. 10. In KO—FTO dataset, both the me—
dian and mean are above zero, meaning that methylation sites de—
tected in KO—FTO have higher fold enrichment than that in WT—
FTO, which is consistent with the fact that knocking out FTO
would lead to increased methylation because FTO is an m6A deme—
thylase. In contrast, in the other datasets, KO—METTLl4/—
METTL3/—WTAP leads to less methylation in the treated conditions,
which is again consistent with the fact that METTL4, METTTL3
and WTAP form the m6A methyltransferase complex. Interestingly,
KO—METTL14 and KO—WTAP introduce more significant reduction
of methylation than KO—METTL3. Indeed, it has been reported that
both METTL14 and WTAP have a larger impact on m6A level than
METTL3 (Liu 815111., 2014).

We also assessed the sequence motif of the detected m6A peaks.

each dataset separately and the results are shown in Fig. 11. The en—
riched motifs from these datasets all contain ‘GGAC’ motif. Then,
we examined the distributions of m6A peaks. As shown in Fig. 12, in
all cases, the distributions in mRNAs are consistent with the previ—
ously reported general distribution of m6A (Meyer et al., 2012),
where a clear enrichment can be seen around the stop codon. In add—
ition, the distributions on lncRNA are also examined in Fig. 12.
This consistent pattern of m6A distribution in mRNA and lncRNA
across different cell lines and species suggests that the m6A methyla—
tion is likely regulated by a similar mechanism. Note that the distri—
butions of KO—M14 and KO—WTAP are somewhat different from

4 Conclusion

We presented MeTPeak, a novel graphical model—based peak call—
ing method for detecting m6A sites from MeRIP—seq data. We for—
mulated the m6A peak calling problem as an inference of the
mixture of binomial distributions by introducing a hierarchical
layer of Beta distribution to model the variances among m6A sites
in replicates. We also used HMM model to capture the reads de—
pendency among the bins. To find the solution to the inference
problem, we proposed a constrained Newton’s method for estimat—
ing the Beta parameters and developed a fast inference mothed for
estimating the m6A peaks. The method is suitable for processing
MeRIP—seq data with replicates and high variance, which are com—
mon cases in MeRIP—seq data. We have compared MeTPeak with
exomePeak both on simulated and real MeRIP—seq datasets and
the results showed that MeTPeak is highly robust against the data
variances and outliers and making far less FPs than exomePeak.
Finally, prediction of MeTPeak on real MeRIP—seq datasets have
suggested that it precisely recapitulates the motif and distribution
of m6A sites, as well as correctly predicting the methylation differ—
ences among these methyltransferases, demonstrating the validity
of MeTPeak.

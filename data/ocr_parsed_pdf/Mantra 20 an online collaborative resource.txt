ABSTRACT

Summary: Elucidation of molecular targets of a compound [mode of
action (MoA)] and its off-targets is a crucial step in drug development.
We developed an online collaborative resource (MANTRA 2.0) that
supports this process by exploiting similarities between drug-induced
transcriptional profiles. Drugs are organized in a network of nodes
(drugs) and edges (similarities) highlighting ‘communities’ of drugs
sharing a similar MoA. A user can upload gene expression profiles
before and after drug treatment in one or multiple cell types. An auto-
mated processing pipeline transforms the gene expression profiles
into a unique drug ‘node’ embedded in the drug-network. Visual in-
spection of the neighbouring drugs and communities helps in revealing
its MoA and to suggest new applications of known drugs (drug repur-
posing). MANTRA 2.0 allows storing and sharing user-generated net-
work nodes, thus making MANTRA 2.0a collaborative ever-growing
resource.

academic use at http://mantra.tigem.it.

1 INTRODUCTION

We developed a computational approach to predict drug mode
of action (MoA) and drug repurposing from the analysis of the
connectivity map (Lamb et al., 2006), a compendium of gene
expression proﬁles (GEPs) following drug treatment of human
cell lines with 1309 bioactive small molecules (Iorio et al., 2010).
The approach was based on generating, for each drug, a single
‘prototype’ ranked list (PRL) of differentially expressed genes
following drug treatment across multiple cell lines or at different
dosages (Iorio et al., 2010). We devised a drug similarity measure
based on gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; Subramanian
et al., 2005) to compute similarity between two PRLs.
Transcriptional similarities were represented as a network. The
position of a drug within the network was shown to provide

insights about its MoA by exploiting previous knowledge on
neighbouring drugs.

Here we introduce a collaborative online resource, named
MANTRA 2.0, implementing our computational approach to
drug discovery integrated with a relational database engineered
to analyse and store user-provided GEPs and metadata following
small-molecule treatments, single gene perturbations or disease
states. An example of a workﬁow can be found in the help sec-
tion of the MANTRA 2.0 website. MANTRA 2.0 guides the
user beginning with GEP upload and annotation, which are
then automatically transformed into a node in the network by
connecting it to similar nodes, according to our similarity meas-
ure. The result is Visualized as an interactive network (Fig. 1) that
can be explored to reveal similarities among drugs, genes and
diseases.

2 METHODS

2.1 GEP database

We used a relational database (PostgreSQL) for GEPs. The database
contains three types of proﬁles: drug-induced, gene perturbation and
disease. Each experiment is stored together with additional metadata.

2.2 Microarray analysis pipeline

MANTRA 2.0 integrates a microarray data analysis pipeline to up-
load experiments in the drug network. Raw ﬁle formats (CEL) for
Affymetrix chips HG-U133A, HT_HG-U133A, HG-U133A_2 and
HG—U133_P1us_2 are supported. The pipeline implements the MASS
and Robust Multiarray Averaging (RMA) algorithms (Gautier et al.,
2004). Differential expression analysis between treated and untreated
samples is performed with a Bayesian t-test (Baldi and Long, 2001) and
BenjaminiiHochberg false discovery rate correction. MANTRA 2.0 also
accepts preprocessed ranked lists of probes (HG-U133A) if raw data are
not available or a custom data analysis pipeline is preferred.

2.3 Generation of PRL and evaluation of similarity

PRLs are generated by merging the ranked lists corresponding to the
same drug by applying the Borda count method in a hierarchical manner
(Iorio et al., 2010). The resulting PRL represents a node in the network.
To obtain pairwise distances between the new node and the nodes already

Fig. 1. MANTRA 2.0 web interface. Drugs are represented as nodes in a
network. Edges are labelled with the distance between the two drugs

present in the network, we implemented a GSEA-based distance (Iorio
et al., 2010). Both the merging procedure and the similarity computation
algorithms have been implemented in C language and built as a dynamic-
link library.

2.4 Visualization and interactive graphical user interface

The network can then be searched for neighbouring nodes or commu-
nities. The user interface has been implemented in ASP.NET and
VB.NET frameworks. A customized version of the MEDUSA (Hooper
and Bork, 2005) visualization system (v.1.03) has been used for the
network View.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

MANTRA 2.0 has been designed with attention to usability and
reliability. The tool consists of three main workspaces: Analysis,
Network and Search.

3.1 The Analysis workspace

The ‘Analysis’ workspace allows the user (i) to add or remove
nodes in the network. A node can be created by uploading micro-
array-based GEPs with metadata. The PRL is added to the
internal database, similarity distances are computed and the
new node becomes part of the network; and (ii) to identify
which drugs in the network up- or downregulate a specific set
of genes by applying GSEA against each PRL in the network.

3.2 The Network workspace

The ‘Network’ workspace, shown in Figure 1, provides an inter-
active Visualization of the network. The network is made up of
nodes representing PRLs and edges connecting significantly simi-
lar pairs of PRLs. Nodes corresponding to drug treatments are

colour-coded if they belong to the same drug community (Iorio
et al., 2010). The network can be navigated by means of a point
and click interface. A number of options are available to limit the
number of nodes and edges Visualized according to both topo-
logical and similarity distance thresholds. The Visualized subnet-
work can be downloaded in the form of tabular data or exported
to Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003). It is also possible to obtain a
summary of common differentially expressed genes for the
selected nodes.

3.3 The Search workspace

The ‘Search’ workspace allows searching the network for nodes
of interest. Queries can be performed with drug/ gene synonyms,
by matching text in the node description or by proximity to a
given node within a threshold.

4 CONCLUSION

MANTRA 2.0 is a collaborative resource for elucidating drug
MoA and for drug repurposing. The network framework makes
it easy to discover unexpected relationships among drugs, genes
and diseases. The possibility of uploading and sharing user’s data
allows for the growth of the network, thus making MANTRA
2.0 an ever-growing collaborative resource for drug discovery.

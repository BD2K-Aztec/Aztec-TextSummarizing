ABSTRACT

Motivation: To advance understanding of eukaryotic cell division,
it is important to observe the process precisely. To this end,
researchers monitor changes in dividing cells as they traverse the
cell cycle, with the presence or absence of morphological or genetic
markers indicating a cell’s position in a particular interval of the
cell cycle. A wide variety of marker data is available, including
information-rich cellular imaging data. However, few formal statistical
methods have been developed to use these valuable data sources
in estimating how a population of cells progresses through the cell
cycle. Furthermore, existing methods are designed to handle only a
single binary marker of cell cycle progression at a time. Consequently,
they cannot facilitate comparison of experiments involving different
sets of markers.

Results: Here, we develop a new sampling model to accommodate
an arbitrary number of different binary markers that characterize
the progression of a population of dividing cells along a branching
process. We engineer a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with
fluorescently labeled markers of cell cycle progression, and apply
our new model to two image datasets we collected from the
strain, as well as an independent dataset of different markers.
We use our model to estimate the duration of post-cytokinetic
attachment between a S.cerevisiae mother and daughter cell. The
Java implementation is fast and extensible, and includes a graphical
user interface. Our model provides a powerful and flexible cell cycle
analysis tool, suitable to any type or combination of binary markers.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cell division is a process fundamental to the growth, development
and reproduction of every living organism. In the case of the budding
yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cell division entails a complex
and highly regulated series of morphological and genetic changes
(Fig. 1). To better understand these changes—and thereby the nature
of budding yeast cell cycle progression—researchers track the status
of certain cellular features that mark progress through the cell
division cycle.

One way to monitor cell cycle progression is with populations of
dividing cells. Such approaches entail synchronizing a population
of cells in culture at some discrete cell cycle stage, releasing the

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

population into the cell division cycle and collecting independent
samples from the culture after release. Under such an approach,
marker status for a sample of cells can then be quantiﬁed at each
time point.

Fluorescent microscope images provide a rich source of marker
data and have become increasingly common (Aikawa et (11., 2007;
Dickinson, 2006; Harder et (11., 2006; Stacey and Hitomi, 2008).
Microscope images provide the means to track large numbers of
cellular features. Fluorescence images, for example, can reveal
the localization and status of organelles, protein complexes and
single proteins (Huh et (11., 2003). In a cell cycle context,
microscope images permit the visualization and quantitation of
multiple cell-cycle-regulated markers, offering a more detailed view
of the relationships and dependencies between subprocesses of cell
division. However, few methods currently exist to extract from these
image data reliable estimates of cell cycle event timing or of cell
cycle progression dynamics in the population.

Furthermore, the types and combinations of markers—image-
derived or otherwise—can vary across studies. In the case of budding
yeast, many groups look for the presence of a bud (the precursor of
the soon-to-be-formed daughter cell). However, additional marker
data can run the gamut from ﬂow cytometric measurements of
DNA content (Haase and Lew, 1997) to the aforementioned features
derived from microscopy images. This lack of consensus in the
markers under observation complicates the comparison of cell cycle
analyses across studies. Thus, new general methods are required to
jointly model marker data, especially when the type or combination
of markers changes from one study to another.

We present a powerful, general model of cell cycle progression in
a population of cells estimated from any number or combination of
binary-valued markers. We build on a branching process framework
called CLOCCS (Characterizing Loss of Cell Cycle Synchrony),
previously developed in our lab for the purpose of describing
populations undergoing cell division (Orlando et (11., 2007, 2009).
However, in this article, we develop a completely new sampling
model that is suited to estimating parameters from any experiment
involving some combination of binary markers of progression. In
addition, our sampling model is designed to address subtle aspects
of observed data that crop up in real experiments. For instance,
some small but non-negligible number of cells may be dead or
halted during the experiment (and thus not progressing through the
cell cycle like the other cells); our sampling model is capable of
estimating the number of such cells.

We demonstrate the utility of our new sampling model on two
datasets of differential interference contrast (DIC) and ﬂuorescence

Fig. 1. Early in the cell cycle. a budding yeast mother cell undergoes a period
of growth (G 1). Just prior to the time of transition from G1 to the period
of DNA replication (S phase). the myosin ring appears at the site of bud
formation (red structure); the bud becomes Visible shortly thereafter. Around
the same time. the spindle pole body (SPB; green structure) duplicates. Now
in S phase. the mother cell replicates its genome (blue bars) within the
nucleus (nucleus not shown). Concurrently. the two SPBs start to separate
from one another. forming a short mitotic spindle. In G2/M phase. the
two SPBs separate further. forming a long mitotic spindle and pulling the
nuclei containing replicated chromosomes into the mother and daughter cells.
respectively. Following mitosis. the cell undergoes cytokinesis in which the
myosin ring constricts to separate the two cytoplasms and then breaks down.
Enzymatic processes must synthesize mother and daughter cell walls before
the two cells can separate.

microscopy images we collected in our lab from populations of
dividing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells over time. We use these
images to track the presence or absence of a set of morphological
markers of cell cycle progression (Figs 1—3). We then use the model
to precisely infer from population-level data the duration of the
attachment period (the length of time following cytokinesis required
for the separation of the daughter cell wall from the mother cell
wall) in yeast cells synchronized by different protocols. We also
show the ﬂexibility of the model by additionally applying it to a
recent dataset of completely different binary markers compiled by
a different lab (Granovskaia et (11., 2010). The extended model and
accompanying software represent a powerful and general tool for
the analysis of cell cycle progression dynamics.

2 MODEL DEVELOPMENT

As mentioned above. we build on CLOCCS. a branching process framework
for describing a population of synchronized cells undergoing cell division.
We therefore devote the next subsection to providing relevant background
on CLOCCS. The remainder of the subsections that follow describe the new
sampling model we developed in this work to estimate cell cycle progression
parameters from any number or combination of binary-valued markers.

2.1 CLOCCS model construction

Working with population-level data has its drawbacks. as the loss of
synchrony during a time course will confound any measurements: due to
synchrony loss. each time point represents a mixture of cells at different
positions in the cell cycle. The three main sources of asynchrony over
time are (i) imperfect initial synchrony in the population. (ii) cell-to-cell
variability in rates of cell cycle progression and (iii) differences in cell
division times that are speciﬁc to certain cell types (e.g. in the case of budding
yeast. daughter cells typically take longer to complete G1). The CLOCCS

of the sample. We continued this procedure a variable number of times (F)
for each sample. stopping when we acquired images of ~100 cells per time

represent the myosin rings while intense blobs in the blue ﬂuorescence image
represent nuclei. The small punctate dots in the green ﬂuorescence image
are the SPBs. In this study. the marker data used as input to CLOCCS were
derived by Visual inspection from images like these. In the images shown.
for example. there are two budded cells. two cells with myosin rings. two
cells with short mitotic spindles and no cells with long mitotic spindles. The
brightness and contrast of the images were slightly modiﬁed with iPhoto
(Apple Computer. Inc.) to increase Visibility.

 

framework has parameters for characterizing the contributions of all three
sources of synchrony loss.

CLOCCS parameters can be grouped into three sets. One set of parameters
speciﬁes the geometry of the branching process underlying cell division.
These parameters describe the duration of the cell cycle (A) and the length
of a daughter-cell-speciﬁc delay in G1 phase ((3). A second set of parameters
speciﬁes how a dividing cell population moves across this branching process.
These parameters describe the initial asynchrony of the population (110,03)
as well as the ‘Velocity’ of cell cycle progression in the population (11V, (73).1

The third set of parameters. in contrast to the ﬁrst two sets of
parameters. depends on the observations. These parameters are speciﬁc to
the morphological marker(s) under study. and demarcate subintervals of the
cell cycle during which a morphological marker is present. In previous
versions of CLOCCS. these sampling model parameters were limited to
budding (Orlando at (11.. 2007) and ﬂow cytometric data (Orlando at (11..
2009). For example. in the case of budding. the parameter bud+ is used to
specify the fraction of the cell cycle that has passed when the bud ﬁrst appears
(e.g. 0.15); only a single parameter is required since the bud disappearing
coincides with the end of the cell cycle and is thus always 1.

 

1We assume that the mean cell cycle velocity 11V is constant over time.
and equal to one cell cycle unit/minute. We also assume that the velocity
distributions of the mother and daughter cells are the same.

General model for multi-marker cell-cycle analysis

 

Because a population of cells loses synchrony over time. a single sample at
any time point represents a mixture of cells of different genealogical ages in
different phases of the cell cycle. To model the mixture of effects contributed
by these subpopulations of cells. we treat cells as members of different
cohorts. A cohort is indexed by its generation (g) and its reproductive instance
(r). Put simply. g is the number of daughter-cell-speciﬁc delays we must take
into account up to a given time point. and r is the index of the cell division
that produced the current cohort. In this formulation. each cohort contributes
different amounts of probability mass to different parts of the cell cycle time
line. Marginalizing over the cohortsiessentially taking the weighted sum
of these different probability mass contributionsiallows us to compute the
probability of a randomly sampled cell from the population being at position
P, along the cell cycle time line as:

Pr(P, |6,t)= ZPKP, |6,g,r,t)Pr(g, r|6,t) where (1)

2.2 General sampling model for binary marker data

Because of the challenge posed by modeling an arbitrary number of different
binary markers of cell cycle progression. we need to devise a new. general
sampling model. This sampling model will tie the presence or absence of
each marker to a cell’s progression through the cell cycle. We introduce
two new parameters for each marker. These two new parameters (e.g. m‘l'
and m‘) represent the start and end time. respectively. of the subinterval in
which marker m is observed. Assuming a marker is initially undetectable.
it eventually becomes detectable some fraction of the way through the cell
cycle. m‘l'. and then undetectable again at 111‘. some time before the end of
the cell cycle.

Further assume that we observe M markers. mj. j = 1, . . .,M. where every
marker now has its own start time. mj‘l' . and end time. ij. Since markers are
initially undetectable. 0 < mj‘l' < ij 5 1. Let M be the set of marker-speciﬁc
parameters M = {mﬁml— ,m;,m2_, . . . ,mAj,m;1}. At least one element of M
must be a non-zero constant. or the problem becomes ill-posed and a unique
solution no longer exists. We can thus use budding index data as one of our
markers. where bud‘ is equal to 1. but other choices are possible.

Assume that samples are drawn at T time points. 1,». i: 1, . . . , T. and that n,
cells are counted at time 1,». Let mji = 1 if the j—th marker is Visible in a living
cell at time t, and mji=0 otherwise. The event that mji=1 indicates that
the position of a cell at time 1,». PH. falls on the lifeline within the interval
[(c+mj+)A,(c+mj_)A] for some cell cycle indexed by integer 030; the
probability of this event is deﬁned by the CLOCCS model.

Thus. we compute the probability of the j—th marker being Visible at time
1,». Pr(m]-,» = 1 |mj+ , ij , 9, 1,») by again marginalizing over the cohorts. Taking

2.3 Accounting for cells with markers present during
synchronization recovery

Synchronization methods are not perfect. At early time points. the cell
population may include a small but non-negligible fraction of cells that have
progressed in the cell cycle beyond the point of sensitivity to the particular
synchronization method. Thus. this fraction of cells may have certain markers
present before the model-speciﬁed beginning of the ﬁrst cell cycle. We call
this proportion of cells with initially present markers ‘early cells”. In the
model. cells with a Visible j—th marker represent a proportion (El-T) of all
cells positioned prior to mj‘l' of the ﬁrst cell cycle. By deﬁnition. early cells
belong to the progenitor cohort (g = r = 0). Thus. the probability of observing
the j—th marker from these cells is calculated as before. but with the addition
of a probability mass contribution from the early cells:

Prrmﬁ=1|an+>=

C

6:0

Here. as previously. E: {mj+,mj_,6,ti} and y,(x)=  with 110, =
—M0+ti and Ut=‘/U§+li2-O'%.

2.4 Accounting for dead or halted cells

Some synchronization protocols place signiﬁcant stress on a population of
cells. As a result. a small percentage of cells may die or halt cell cycle
progression before release from synchrony (henceforth. we refer to either
kind of cell simply as dead). Each marker in a dead cell may be either
present or absent. but cannot change over the course of the experiment. The
probability of observing a marker includes contributions from living cells
with periodically present markers and dead cells with constantly present
markers. Let vi,» = 1 if the j—th marker is present in a cell at time t, and vi,» :0
otherwise. Let

Pr(vj,=1|§,ln:j+,D,DJ-+)=

 

 

_+. D _, _ _+ _ _

D’ Q90) Wm” ‘1 IE’E’ ) (1 (29(2))
where D is the fraction of cells that are dead after synchronization and Dj‘l'
is the fraction of dead cells with a Visible j—th marker. We assume that the
number of dead cells remains constant over the course of the experiment and
that as the cell population size increases. the relative proportion of dead cells
decreases. Thus. we divide the initial proportion of dead cells D by Q90).

2.5 Joint likelihood of multiple markers

We model marker presence as a binomial random variable with the success
probability pi,» deﬁned as Pr(v]-i =1 |§,Ej+,D,D]-+) and the number of trials
n, as the number of cells counted at time 1,». As we only have access to
population-level statistics rather than statistics from individual cells. we
assume that the presence of every marker is conditionally independent of

the others given the CLOCCS branching process parameters 9. marker

where pi,» = Pr(v]-i = 1 |§,E-+,D,Dj+) is the probability of marker j being
present at time 1,». and nj,» is the number of cells with a Visible j—th marker at
time 1,». The set 8 contains all the Ej‘l's. and the set D contains D along with
all the Dj‘l's.

2.6 Prior speciﬁcation and Markov chain Monte Carlo
parameter inference

All priors are selected to be slightly informative. since synchronization
protocols and experimental conditions greatly affect posterior parameter
estimates. The priors for the CLOCCS parameters 6 were taken from
Orlando et a1. (2009). Thus. 110~Exp(1/78.2). A~N(78.2,18.22). c70~
|nv-Gamma(2,78.2/3) and a, ~|nv-Gamma(12,1).

One change is that we use a gamma prior on 8 instead of the exponential
prior mentioned in Orlando et a1. (2009). The daughter-speciﬁc G1 delay
can last anywhere from 10 to 60 min depending on the synchronization
method (Hartwell and Unger. 1977; Lord and Wheals. 1983). An exponential
prior places signiﬁcant weight at values near zero. which does not match our
prior knowledge about the biological value of (3; therefore. we use a more
appropriate diffuse gamma prior with a mean of 30 [8 ~ Gamma(10, 1/3)]2.

For each of the marker-speciﬁc parameters. we used the slightly
informative priors mj‘l' ~ Beta(2,4) and ij ~ Beta(4, 2) since in each case
we know mj‘l' takes place before ij. We treat budding specially. where
171,411+ ~Beta(2.4, 17.6) and bud‘ = 1. For each marker. we expect only a
small number of cells to have that marker present during synchronization
recovery. Thus. we place a slightly informative prior on each Ej‘l' to
be small [Ej'l' ~ Beta(1,20)]. Similarly. we assume most cells survive
synchronization. so we place an informative prior on the percentage of dead
cells to be very small [D ~ Beta(1,50)]. Since we have no knowledge about
which markers might be Visible in a dead cell. we use uninformative priors
for each [DJ-+ ~Beta(1, 1)].

The parameters for each binary marker may be constrained relative to one
another. Due to the nature of how long spindles are deﬁned. m‘ for short
spindles and m‘l' for long spindles are deﬁned to be equal. Additionally. one
could imagine constraining other marker-speciﬁc parameters. For example.
since myosin rings are Visible before bud emergence. we could require m‘l'
for the myosin rings to occur before m‘l' for budding.

To infer parameters. we use a simulated annealing algorithm (Kirkpatrick
at al.. 1983) to initialize a random walk Metropolis algorithm (Gilks at al..
1996; Metropolis at al.. 1953). The simulated annealing initialization step
was run for 20000 iterations while the burn-in period of the Metropolis
algorithm lasted another 50000 iterations. The Metropolis algorithm was
tuned to mix well and was run for a further 200000 iterations to obtain
posterior parameter estimates. Plots of posterior samples appeared stationary.
and the Raftery and Lewis diagnostic (Raftery and Lewis. 1992) indicated
that the sample is sufﬁcient to estimate the 0.025th quantile of any marginal
posterior to within 0.01 with a probability of 0.95.

2.7 Software development

We developed a multi-platform software tool with a user-friendly GUI
for inferring CLOCCS parameters from user-supplied data. The software
supports parameter inference using any combination of binary markers of
cell cycle progression (as well as ﬂow cytometry data if that is available).
The GUI can Visualize and record modeling results (for example. all later
ﬁgures were produced with the GUI). Other features include options for

 

2Here 1 / 3 is a rate parameter rather than a scale parameter.

controlling the prior parameter distributions. generating posterior histograms
for every inferred parameter. and exporting images in jpg. png or pdf
format. The software implementation was designed to be fast and easily
extensible. making it quite simple to modify the CLOCCS model to handle
different combinations of cell cycle markers. On an Intel Core 2 Duo @
3.0 GHz. running 300000 iterations for a model with four markers takes
roughly 5min to complete; in practice. we typically see convergence in
approximately 10 000 iterations (10 s).

3 EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

3.1 Strain construction

We used a previously constructed haploid yeast strain (SBY408; bar] ;
SPC42-GFP-TRPI-Z20R) derived from strain BF264-15DU (MATa; ade];
his2; 12112-1112; trpI-I; ura3Ans) (Richardson at al.. 1992) in which a
constituent protein of the spindle pole body. Spc42. had been ﬂuorescently
labeled with green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP). To ﬂuorescently label Myol.
a myosin ring protein. we ampliﬁed the plasmid pFA6a-mCherry-kanMX6
(Shaner at al.. 2004; Sheff and Thorn. 2004) using forward primer
(5’AAATATTGATAGTAACAATGCACAGAGTAAAATTTTCAGTCGGA
TCCCCGGGTTAATTAA3’) and reverse primer (5’CTTTATTTTATGTAC

CACCTTTAAGACTACTATCGAAGGAGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC3 ’).

The PCR products were then used to transform SBY408. with integration
of the mCherry ﬂuorescent protein at the C-terminus of Myol occurring by
homologous recombination. as previously described (Longtine at al.. 1998).
The resulting haploid yeast strain was labeled SBY1404.

3.2 Time-course microscopy and marker quantiﬁcation

Yeast cultures were grown in YEPD medium (1% yeast extract. 2% bacto-
peptone. 0.012% adenine. 0.006% uracil. 2% dextrose) at 30°C. For ot-factor
treatment. cultures were grown up overnight. resuspended in fresh media
in the morning. and left to proliferate for a couple of hours to reach log-
phase. Then. the mating pheromone ot-factor was added to the culture for
a ﬁnal concentration of 50 ng/ml. After 2h. a sample of the culture was
checked for the absence of buds with a light microscope. Pheromone was
removed by centrifugation and the synchronized population of G l-arrested
cells were resuspended in fresh YEPD medium and grown at 30°C. Every
10 min. 200 111 samples were taken. resulting in a total of 20 time points. For
centrifugal elutriation. small daughter cells were isolated from a log-phase
culture. released into YEPD + 1 M sorbitol and grown at 30°C as previously
described (Orlando at al.. 2008). Every 8 min. 300 111 samples were taken.
resulting in a total of 28 time points. All samples were kept on ice for 5 min
prior to ﬁxation with 2% paraformaldehyde. Samples were then washed
with PBS and stored in the dark at 4°C in 30% glycerol. DNA was stained
with 1 Mg/ml 4.6’-diamino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Roche
Diagnostics. Indianapolis. IN. USA). Cells from each time point were imaged
with a Zeiss Axio Imager wideﬁeld ﬂuorescence microscope with either a
100>< or 63>< objective and standard ﬁlter sets (Thornwood. NY. USA).
Image acquisition was performed with a Hamamatsu Orca ER monochrome
cooled CCD camera with IEEE (Bridgewater. NJ . USA) and MetaMorph
(Universal Imaging. Downington. PA. USA).

Cell characteristics were manually quantiﬁed on a population level. For
each time point. the number of cells with a bud. with a myosin ring. with a
short mitotic spindle and with a long mitotic spindle were recorded. Budding
was quantiﬁed using a light microscope. while we quantiﬁed myosin ring and
SPB status with a ﬂuorescent microscope. For each feature. we counted all
cells across the multiple ﬁelds of View of a given time point to get the number
of cells in the sample with that feature (Figs 2 and 3). A cell was counted
as having a short mitotic spindle if two SPBs were Visible inside the mother
cell; it was counted as having a long mitotic spindle if a myosin ring was
between the two SPBs.

General model for multi-marker cell-cycle analysis

 

3.3 Marker data regarding division status and location
of nucleus

To demonstrate the applicability of the model to any kind of binary marker
data. we analyzed a different set of marker data collected by Granovskaia
at al. (2010). Rather than elutriating cells or treating them with mating
pheromone. the authors subjected populations of cells to a genetic arrest-
release protocol in which all cells were temperature-sensitive mutants
(cch8-13) of the budding yeast cyclin-dependent kinase. Cdc28. The kinase
is a key regulator necessary for cell cycle initiation and completion. At 38°C
(restrictive temperature). kinase activity is inhibited and the population of
cells arrests at the end of G1 phase. At 25°C (permissive temperature). kinase
activity is restored and the population of cells proceeds into the cell cycle.
For more experimental details. please refer to Granovskaia at al. (2010). In
addition to measurements of budding. the authors collected measurements
of the fractions of dividing nuclei and of nuclei at the bud neck (the interface
between the mother cell and the bud).

4 RESULTS

Using a multimodal imaging platform, we collected DIC and
ﬂuorescence microscopy images of four markers of budding yeast
cell cycle progression; namely, myosin rings, buds, short mitotic
spindles and long mitotic spindles. We used the DIC images to
measure budding and the ﬂuorescence images to detect the other
markers (see Section 3.2). We processed the images visually,
counting cells with each marker across all ﬁelds of view at each
time point. We compiled two such image datasets on populations
of budding yeast cells synchronized either by treatment with the
mating pheromone a-factor or by centrifugal elutriation. In the
former method of synchronization, cells arrest at the point of cell
cycle entry in late G1 known as START (Hartwell et (11., 1974).
Centrifugal elutriation on the other hand selects cells based on their
size, isolating the smallest cells.

4.1 Model-based analysis of cell cycle progression data
derived from microscopy images

The CLOCCS model ﬁts and inferred cell cycle subintervals of each
marker for the two image datasets are shown in Figures 4 and 5.

In both cases, the posterior ﬁts track the data well. Furthermore,
the order of cell cycle events reﬂected in the order of peaks of
marker visibility (Fig. 4) and the positioning of the marker-speciﬁc
subintervals (Fig. 5) matches current biological knowledge of the
budding yeast cell cycle. With minimal prior constraints (ss‘ =1s+;
Table 1) on the order of each pair of marker-speciﬁc parameters,
CLOCCS infers the formation of the myosin ring followed by
emergence of the bud and appearance of the short and then long
mitotic spindle (Bi et (11., 1998; Hartwell, 1974). Another CLOCCS-
inferred parameter, the average time at which a cell recovers
from synchronization and enters the cell cycle ([10), recapitulates
analytical and experimental observations that elutriated cells take
longer to recover on average than cells treated with a-factor [Table 1;
(Belli et (11., 2001; Orlando et (11., 2007)]. Parameter estimates for
both datasets were comparable, demonstrating the robustness of the
model to different synchronization methods. In particular, estimates
of cell cycle duration (A) are consistent with empirical evidence
[Table 1; 96.9 min from Lord and Wheals (1981)]. The proportion
of dead cells estimated for both the a-factor and elutriation datasets
was close to zero, while estimates for the proportion of early cells
differed between the two datasets. More speciﬁcally, the a-factor—
treated cells showed a signiﬁcant proportion of early cells with
myosin rings, but proportions with later markers were close to zero.
In contrast, estimates from the elutriated cells revealed a signiﬁcant
proportion of early cells with myosin rings present, a slightly smaller
proportion of budded early cells, and smaller proportions still with
short and long mitotic spindles. These estimates reﬂect the timing
of appearance of these markers as well as our expectation that
early cells are not too far advanced in their cell cycle progression.
The model was able to identify this relationship between the
proportions of early elutriated cells with different markers without
the speciﬁcation of any constraints on inference of the parameters.

and daughter cells

and the end of budding budT to estimate the duration of time
between the end of cytokinesis and the separation of the daughter
and mother cell walls. By way of background, when we quantify
budded cells, we are actually looking at two subpopulations of cells;
one in which the mother cell has not yet undergone cytokinesis
and another in which the mother and daughter cell have distinct
cytoplasms but share a cell wall (an organelle of the budding yeast
that surrounds the standard eukaryotic cell membrane). The period
between the end of cytokinesis and cell wall separation is sometimes

called the attachment period (up) and, based on our CLOCCS
parameters, can be calculated as ap=A-(bud_ —mr_). We found
an attachment period for elutriated cells of ~13 min and for the a-
factor-treated cells of ~4 min. Both estimates are in line with the
previously experimentally derived attachment period estimates of
~10 min (Lord and Wheals, 1981).

4.3 Application of CLOCCS to cell cycle progression
data of Granovskaia et al.

With the new general sampling model, CLOCCS is suited to any
number or type of binary marker data. To demonstrate this feature
of CLOCCS, we analyzed a different dataset of binary marker data
recently compiled by Granovskaia et (11. (2010). Besides recording
the presence or absence of buds, Granovskaia and colleagues
monitored two binary markers not present in our image datasets:
the presence or absence of dividing nuclei and nuclei at the bud
neck. In addition to using different binary markers, the authors
used a genetics-based protocol to synchronize cell populations
(Section 3.3) rather than a-factor treatment or centrifugal elutriation.
Our inferences of mj+ and ij for the two nucleic markers are
constrained such that budding precedes the appearance of nuclei
at the bud neck (bud+ <nucneck+) and nuclei only divide after
appearing at the bud neck (nucneck+ <nucdiv+). The CLOCCS
model ﬁts and inferred marker-speciﬁc intervals are shown in
Figure 6.

Most parameter estimates from the Granovskaia et (11. (2010)
data are comparable with those derived from our own experiments
(Tables 1 and 2). The inferred intervals also recapitulate the
empirical observation that the nucleus does not spend much time
at the bud neck prior to nuclear division (Lord and Wheals, 1981).
We note that, as is not the case for our own data, a non-negligible
proportion of dead cells are inferred (Table 2). However, due to
the uncertainty associated with the Dj‘I‘ parameters in this fraction

of cells (especially D+ k with a 95% conﬁdence interval (CI)

nucnec
between 0.281 and 0.998), interpretation of these estimates is

difﬁcult. Estimates of the fraction of early cells with either nuclei
positioned at the bud neck or dividing nuclei were essentially
zero, while estimates of early budded cells were around 1%
(Table 2). These results suggest a relatively synchronous initial cell
population with the initial synchrony potentially due to the genetics-
based method of synchronization used by the authors (Granovskaia
et (11., 2010). This analysis illustrates how the model can easily
accommodate any binary markers of cell cycle progression.

4.4 Effect of early and dead cells on CLOCCS model

Accounting for early cells as well as dead cells required the
introduction of two additional components to the model (see
Sections 2.3 and 2.4). To assess the relative extent to which these
two components improve our modeling performance, we ﬁt the data
derived from d-factor—treated cells with four versions of the model.
In the simple model, neither early nor dead cells are accounted for.
In the other three models, one or both of the two types of cells were
incorporated (Fig. 7).

Inclusion of dead cells in the model did not signiﬁcantly improve
ﬁts to the data (panels B and D of Figure 7 are indistinguishable
from the corresponding panels A and C). In contrast, incorporating
the early cells into the model improved ﬁts to the d-factor data,
particularly the number of myosin rings counted at the early time
points, though with some increased uncertainty owing to the fact
that ﬁtting the Er}; parameter relies on only the earliest time points.
The dead-cell-related parameters effectively allow vertical shifts in
the posterior ﬁts to the marker data. The Dj+ parameters are slightly
more constrained since they are weighted by a shared D. Thus, the
proportion of dead cells inﬂuences the model ﬁts for all markers
and at all time points. Conversely, the early cell-related parameters
are not so constrained in that a single parameter is inferred for each
marker and is governed mostly by the earliest time points. The lack
of signiﬁcant change in the budding, short spindle and long spindle
curves upon incorporation of the early cells (Fig. 7C and D) is as
expected, since d-factor-treated cells arrest at START and thus may
possess a visible myosin ring, but are not expected to have budded
or migrated their SPBs.

Although ﬁgures are not shown, a similar observation holds for
elutriated cells, as can be seen from the parameters in Table 1. The
inclusion of dead cells adds little in this experiment, but a small
number of elutriated cells have already assembled myosin rings, and
smaller numbers have even budded and established a short spindle.
Again, this is consistent with the biology of the synchronization
procedure as cells are not arrested at START, but are rather simply
selected to be small. It should be mentioned that the dead cell
parameters did play a role in the data of Granovskaia et (11., where
the temperature-sensitive mutant arrest may leave a few cells halted
even after return to a permissive temperature.

5 DISCUSSION

One obvious extension of the model framework would be to obtain
a joint measurement of the marker status of each cell, rather than
independently assaying the presence of each marker as we are now.
Knowing the joint marker status of each cell would permit the
modeling of markers as a multivariate binomial random variable,
and thus allow us to assess correlations between the presence
of different markers, which might be particularly important when

studying various kinds of mutant strains in which the timings of cell
cycle events have been disrupted or shufﬂed.

Doing this would be signiﬁcantly easier if marker status were
to be quantiﬁed automatically rather than compiled manually. We
are currently exploring publicly available image processing tools
like CellProﬁler (Carpenter et (11., 2006) as well as development of
custom software routines to obtain the joint marker status for each
cell.

Besides leveraging image processing algorithms to speed up data
acquisition, we are also exploring techniques to enrich the precision
of our data, moving from binary markers to markers with more than
two states (n-ary). For example, rather than simply assessing the
presence or absence of a bud, we could obtain n-ary measurements
of the approximate volume of the bud. The general sampling model
we have presented here can be easily extended to incorporate these
types of markers by modeling the markers as multinomial random
variables instead of binomial random variables. Estimates from n-
ary markers would allow us to analyze high-resolution details of a
marker’s behavior over time (e.g. bud volume increase in S phase
versus Gg/M phase).

We found in our previous work that incorporation of more markers
not only leads to more accurate parameter estimates, but also allows
a better characterization of the progression dynamics of smaller
and smaller subintervals of the cell cycle (Orlando et (11., 2009).
This result is of great biological importance as the incorporation

of more markers can vastly improve the temporal resolution of
experimental determination of cell cycle events. This improved
temporal resolution carries the potential for a better understanding of
the genetic and molecular underpinnings of cell cycle progression.

In essence, our method aims to uncover the dependencies between
subcellular processes as well as the temporal ordering of the events
associated with these processes. Thus, while the model we have
presented was applied in the context of a cell cycle analysis in
S.cerevisi(1e cells, the principles of the model are applicable to
other biological processes such as development (Dickinson, 2006)
or disease progression (Weissleder and Pittet, 2008; Wolf et (11.,
2007) in a range of different organisms, tissues and cells. In
this way, the model represents a general framework for ﬁlture
methods development and an important step toward generating
more comprehensive, systems-level views of complex biological
processes.

6 CONCLUSION

We have presented a new, general sampling model for observations
of any type or combination of binary-valued markers in the context
of analyzing the cell cycle progression of dividing cell populations.
This model is the ﬁrst approach capable of estimating from multiple
binary-valued markers the cell cycle progression dynamics and
cell cycle event timing of a dividing cell population. Furthermore,

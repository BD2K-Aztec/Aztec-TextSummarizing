Abstract

Summary: MicroRNAs are short non—coding RNA which function to fine—tune protein levels in all
cells. This is achieved mainly by sequence—specific binding to 3’ untranslated regions of target
mRNA. The result is post—transcriptional interference in gene expression which reduces protein lev—
els either by promoting destabilisation of mRNA or translational repression. Research published
since 2010 shows that microRNAs are important regulators of gene expression in epilepsy. A series
of microRNA profiling studies in rodent and human tissue has revealed that epilepsy is associated
with wide ranging changes to microRNA levels in the brain. These are thought to influence proc—
esses including cell death, inflammation and re—wiring of neuronal networks. MicroRNAs have also
been identified in the blood after injury to the brain and therefore may serve as biomarkers of
epilepsy. EpimiRBase is a manually curated database for researchers interested in the role
of microRNAs in epilepsy. The fully searchable database includes information on up— and down—
regulated microRNAs in the brain and blood, as well as functional studies, and covers both rodent
models and human epilepsy.

1 IntrOducﬂon sequence—specific binding to 3’ untranslated regions of target mRNA

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affect—
ing ~65 million people worldwide. It is characterised by recurring
seizures; abnormal, synchronous firing of groups of neurons within
the brain that disrupt sensory, motor and other brain functions
(Chang and Lowenstein, 2003; Fisher et (11., 2014). Although anti—
epileptic drugs help control seizures for many patients, there is no
cure for epilepsy and about one in three patients are drug resistant.
Analysis of brain tissue from patients and rodent models suggests
that there are large—scale changes in gene expression within affected
brain regions (Pitkanen and Lukasiuk, 2011). Understanding what
controls gene expression may open new avenues for treatment or
prevention of epilepsy.

MicroRNAs are short non—coding RNAs which function to
fine—tune protein levels in all cells. They achieve this mainly by

(Bartel, 2004). The result is post—transcriptional interference in gene
expression which reduces protein levels either by promoting desta—
bilisation of mRNA or translational repression (Bartel, 2009).
Targeting typically requires a 2—8—nt Watson—Crick base pairing (the
so—called ‘seed’ region) between the 5’ end of the microRNA and its
mRNA target (Bartel, 2009). This interaction is mediated by pro—
teins of the Argonaute (Ago) family, in particular Ag02 (Czech and
Hannon, 201 1).

Since 2010, research has emerged that shows microRNAs are im—
portant regulators of gene expression in epilepsy. Changes to many
different microRNAs have been reported to date, through a combin—
ation of animal studies and analysis of human tissue samples. The
regulated microRNAs are implicated in controlling levels of proteins
involved in processes such as cell death, inﬂammation, re—wiring of

neuronal networks and other cell functions (Dogini et (11., 2013;
Jimenez—Mateos and Henshall, 2013). MicroRNAs have also been
identified in the blood after injury to the brain and therefore may
serve as biomarkers of epilepsy (Gorter et (11., 2014; Liu et (11., 2010;
Wang et (11., 2015 ). A number of functional studies have determined
that the manipulation of individual microRNAs can exert a power—
ful effect on seizures and seizure—induced neuronal death (Jimenez—
Mateos et (11., 2012; Tan et (11., 2013).

As active investigators in this growing area of epilepsy research,
we recognised the need for a database to keep track of the rapidly
expanding published literature on microRNAs and epilepsy.
We have developed EpimiRBase in order to provide complete and
up—to—date information on all publications relating to microRNAs
and epilepsy. The database contains over 2000 manually curated
microRNA entries including up—/down—regulated microRNAs from
high—throughput profiling studies of human brain tissue and rodent
experimental models, after evoked seizures and in chronic epilepsy;
low—throughput expression analysis and functional studies in which
microRNAs have been manipulated in seizure models; and
microRNA biomarker studies in which microRNAs have been sur—
veyed in bioﬂuids such as blood in epilepsy patients and animal
models of epilepsy.

2 Implementation

Initial studies for inclusion in EpimiRBase were selected using a
PubMed search (date: August 18, 2015) and the search terms
‘Epilepsy and microRNA’ (returned 104 results) and ‘Seizure and
microRNA’ (returned 63 results). These two lists were cross refer—
enced and duplications were removed. From the remaining list of
published studies we selected only those reports that had intention—
ally investigated a role for microRNA in human epilepsy or an
in vivo experimental seizure model. We have continued to update
EpimiRBase as new publications become available. We apologise in
advance to authors of any studies that we may have missed in this
version of the database and urge them to contact us to ensure their
inclusion in the next release.

MicroRNA names from each publication were mapped to
miRBase 21 using the R package miRNAmeConverter. MicroRNAs
that could not be unambiguously mapped to miRBase 21, or that
were not included in miRBase 21, were removed. We also removed
any microRNAs that were not human, mouse or rat (e.g. ebv, kshv,
mghv) and novel microRNAs. We incorporated this database into a
user—friendly web—based portal to facilitate discovery, browsing and
searching for microRNAs which are or may be related to epilepsy.
The database is searchable by any of the following parameters:
microRNA name, regulation (up/down), type of study (i.e. low—
throughput expression analysis and functional experiments or high—
throughput profiling methods), species, publication authors and
expression details. Users can input the exact microRNA name (such
as mmu—miR—22—3p) or part of a name, for example the numeric
portion (such as 22); searches are dynamic and can be partial or
complete and become more refined as detail is added. After submit—
ting a query all entries that are related to the user’s query are listed
and users can sort the entries by any column (Fig. 1). An advanced
search is also available where the user can filter the data based on
any or all of the above parameters.

Details are provided on the regulation (up or down), the study
type (profiling, expression analysis or functional), the species and
the microRNA expression patterns (timing of up— or down—
regulation). We also provide links to the miRBase entry for each

microRNA (Kozomara and Griffiths—Jones, 2014), a PubMed link to
the publication associated with each database entry, links to two
databases of validated microRNA targets, TarBase (Vlachos et (11.,
2015) and miRTarBase (Hsu et (11., 2014) and a link to a page which
provides summary information on the experimental design (by click—
ing on ‘Experimental Details’). Some authors have argued that many
of the sequences in miRBase are not derived from bona fide
microRNA genes, therefore, we have included a link for each
microRNA entry to MirGeneDB, a recently published database of
manually curated and highly supported bona fide microRNAs
(Fromm et (11., 2015). For example, of the 1,881 human microRNAs
listed in miRBase, only 523 meet the standards for microRNA anno—
tation in MirGeneDB. The entire EpimiRBase database is available
for download in CSV, XML and JSON formats.

Finally, authors are encouraged to submit data from recently
published expression analysis, functional and profiling studies to us
using the EpimiRBase submissions page. Once approved, the sub—
mitted records will be included in the next version of the database
and made available to the public.

3 Discussion and conclusion

EpimiRBase is a comprehensive manually curated database of over
2000 microRNA—epilepsy associations from 34 publications to
date including 973 unique microRNA (1191 up— and 864 down—
regulated) from three species: human (161), mouse (849) and rat
(1045). We have categorised the microRNA into four study types:
expression analysis (41), functional (12), profiling—bioﬂuid (32) and
profiling—brain (1970). Information about the current version of the
database and the most recent updates and statistics are available
from the EpimiRBase website. The development and expansion of
EpimiRBase will be ongoing and more publications describing
microRNA involvement in epilepsy will be integrated into the data—
base as they become available. We encourage authors of these stud—
ies to contact us and submit their data and members of the
community to alert us to relevant publications we have not yet
included. We hope that biologists and medical researchers who
work in the field of epilepsy research will find EpimiRBase a useful
addition to their toolbox and the annotations found in EpimiRBase
will help them design and prioritise further experimental epilepsy
research.

Abstract

Profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) are known to efficiently predict whether an amino
acid (AA) sequence belongs to a specific protein family. Profile HMMs can also be used to search
for protein domains in genome sequences. In this case, HMMs are typically learned from AA
sequences and then used to search on the six—frame translation of nucleotide (NT) sequences.
However, this approach demands additional processing of the original data and search results.
Here, we propose an alternative and more direct method which converts an AA alignment into an

 

NT one, after which an NT—based HMM is trained to be applied directly on a genome.

1 Introduction

The identification of protein coding sequences is an important step
in genome annotation. Profile hidden Markov models (profile
HMMs) (Eddy, 1998) are probabilistic models that can efficiently
search for characteristic domains of protein families in databases.
For this purpose, profile HMMs can be trained from alignments of
amino acid (AA) sequences, called here AA-HMMs.

As nucleotide (NT) sequences degrade more rapidly than the AA
sequences they encode, AA alignments are generally more accurate
than their corresponding NT ones (Abascal et (11., 2010; Wernersso
and Pedersen, 2003). Moreover, AA alignments can be more easily
obtained than NT alignments: databases like Pfam (Punta et (11.,
2012) and CDD (Marchler—Bauer et (11., 2013) make available AA
alignments related to many protein domains. Therefore, AA-HMMs
have also been used for searching for protein domains in genomes.
The usual way of doing this is to translate the genome sequence into
six AA sequences according to the reading frames and apply the

HMMs on each one. However, this approach demands additional
treatment of both the original data and the search results, such as
translating the whole genome into six AA sequences. Furthermore,
depending on the tool to run the HMMs, it is necessary to cut each
AA sequence into small windows and create overlapping windows
to prevent loss of regions of interest, leading to a lot of overhead.
The length of the windows and the overlapping regions depend on
the HMM to be used, which becomes worse when using several
HMMs with very different numbers of states. Moreover, the relative
positions of the HMMs predictions have to be mapped onto the real
positions in the genome.

In this work, we propose a method that converts AA alignments
into NT ones to learn HMMs from NT, called here NT-HMMs, for
searching directly on NT sequences. This method is an alternative in
order to avoid all the additional data and results processing previ-
ously described. We tested our method searching for different types
of protein domain in several organisms. The method was developed
for using with the program HMMER (Eddy, 2009).

Learning N T—HMMs from AA alignments

1837

 

2 Methods

In this section, we describe the main aspects of our method; details
can be found in the Supplementary Material.

2.1 Converting AA alignments into NT alignments

The conversion from an AA alignment to an NT alignment requires
a coding matrix. This matrix consists of 20 rows; each row repre—
sents an AA and each column has one of the possible codons related
to that AA. The set of codons for each AA must be repeated in each
row for a certain number of times, obtained as follows. First, the
lowest common multiple (LCM) among the quantities of codons of
all AA is calculated. The LCM value is then divided by the quantity
of codons of a given AA, producing the number of repetitions of its
set of codons in its corresponding row. For example, for the
Universal Genetic Code, the AA are coded from 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6
codons; the LCM between these values is 12. The LCM is the num—
ber of columns of the matrix. Thus, if an AA is coded from four dif—
ferent codons, as for example Alanine, its set of codons is repeated
three times in its row of the matrix. For Tryptophan its unique
codon appears repeated 12 times in its row. Using this coding ma—
trix, in the conversion process, each AA sequence of the original
alignment gives rise to ‘LCM’ sequences of NT (in the example,
LCM: 12): to produce each resulting NT sequence, each AA of a
sequence is replaced every time by one of the ‘LCM’ codes (codons)
that appear in its corresponding row of the coding matrix, which
causes an AA alignment of N sequences to produce an NT alignment
of 12N sequences.

The conversion method proposed here is supported by the fact
that a state sequence of an HMM is a first—order Markov chain
(Eddy, 1998) but the emission probabilities for each state are calcu—
lated taking into account only one specific position of the alignment
at each time. Considering this, the order of the codons inside of the
respective sets is irrelevant—what is important is the number of repe—
titions of each codon set (indeed, the number of each codon) in each
row of the conversion matrix. Furthermore, when an HMM evalu—
ates a sequence, each AA or NT is scored by an HMM state in an in—
dependent way of the rest of the alignment for that sequence (Eddy,
1998). Thus, each AA of an alignment of AA sequences can be
replaced directly by its possible codons. So, for example, there is no
need to combine the possible codons of all AA for that sequence.

The conversion process ensures that the final NT alignment con—
tains sequences with the same length, which is required by
HMMER. Also, this ensures the proportionality between NT for
each AA in relation to the three positions of a codon. Then, the NT
alignment is ready for learning an HMM.

3 Results

In this section, we verify whether HMMs built on converted NT
alignments are able to retrieve genome sequences related to the
tested domains. We compare the results produced by corresponding
NT—HMMs and AA—HMMs with each other and also compare them
with domain annotations for the genomes, if they are available.
Details can be found in the Supplementary Material.

3.1 Searching for domains of Ribonuclease H

Initially, we tested our method by searching for Ribonuclease H of
Retrotransposons (RNase_HI_RT_Ty1 and RNase_HI_RT_Ty3) on
chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster present in Flybase (St
Pierre et 41., 2014)—the AA alignments were obtained from CDD
(see Supplementary Table 51) and converted into NT ones using our

conversion method. An AA—HMM and an NT—HMM for each sub—
type of RNase H were learned using the alignments.

We compare the search results from corresponding HMMs with
each other (we did not find annotations to compare with). The re—
sults show that both types of HMMs of RNase_HI_RT_Ty1 and
RNase_HI_RT_Ty3 identified, respectively, the same 58 and 323
potentially full—length sequences (the ones that putatively are func—
tional) in all tested chromosomes. Furthermore, respectively, 20 and
83 defective sequences (harboring indels—insertions or deletions—
hampering the domain integrity) were equally predicted by both
types of HMM. The number of unmatched predictions was very low
(see Supplementary Tables SS and S6).

3.2 Searching for phosphatases in bacteria

In the second test, we used AA—HMMs and NT—HMMs to search
for phosphatase domains in genomes of bacteria (Supplementary
Table S4). We were interested in specific phosphatase domains that,
according to Pfam, are found in some bacteria but not in others. The
AA alignments of these domains were obtained from Pfam
(Supplementary Table 52), converted into NT ones and used to train
the HMMs.

For the tested domains and genomes, the related AA—HMM and
NT—HMM predicted virtually the same annotated sequences—the
differences between the start (respectively, end) positions of corres—
ponding predictions are always less than 5 NT. The number of false
positives was very low (Supplementary Tables S7—Sll ).

3.3 Searching for CBM_1 and Fungal_trans in fungi

In this test, we searched for the carbohydrate—binding module
(CBM_1) and fungal specific transcription factor (Fungal_trans)—
their AA alignments were obtained from Pfam (Supplementary
Table S3) and converted into NT ones. Four HMMs were trained
using these alignments and run on the Aspergillus fumigatus and A.
niger genomes. We compared the predictions of both types of HMM
with annotations for the tested fungi.

The CBM_1 domain annotations for these fungi describe 17
sequences in A. fumigatus and 8 sequences in A. niger. All these se—
quences were predicted correctly by both NT—HMM and AA—
HMM. The number of false positives was very low (Supplementary
Table 512).

For Fungal_trans, 165 sequences are annotated in A. fumigatus:
21 of them were not predicted by any HMM; additionally, the AA—
HMM missed 9 annotations, which were predicted by the NT—
HMM, and the NT—HMM missed 14 other ones that were identified
by the AA—HMM. In A. niger, 223 sequences are annotated: 20
of them were missed by both HMMs; the AA—HMM did not pre—
dict 23 other ones, identified by the NT—HMM; the NT—HMM
missed 28 annotations that were predicted by the AA—HMM
(Supplementary Tables 513 and 514). A possible explanation for
these losses would be the presence of introns inside the domain se—
quences. These numbers suggest that, in situations like this, the total
of correct predictions could be improved by combining the results of
both types of HMM.

4 Conclusions

In this paper, we describe a method to convert an AA alignment into
an NT one. Experiments on several genomes show that the
NT—HMMs trained using converted alignments presented the same
performance as the corresponding AA—HMMs for RNase H, phos—
phatases and CBM_1 domains. For Fungal_trans, the AA—HMM
was slightly better than the corresponding NT—HMM. The results

also show that both types of HMM can lose domain sequences
when indels or introns are present inside them. In these cases, both
types of HMM could be used together to increase the number of cor—
rect predictions.

Abstract

Motivation: High—dimensional single—cell snapshot data are becoming widespread in the systems
biology community, as a mean to understand biological processes at the cellular level. However,
as temporal information is lost with such data, mathematical models have been limited to capture
only static features of the underlying cellular mechanisms.

Results: Here, we present a modular framework which allows to recover the temporal behaviour
from single—cell snapshot data and reverse engineer the dynamics of gene expression. The frame—
work combines a dimensionality reduction method with a cell time—ordering algorithm to generate
pseudo time—series observations. These are in turn used to learn transcriptional ODE models and
do model selection on structural network features. We apply it on synthetic data and then on real
hematopoietic stem cells data, to reconstruct gene expression dynamics during differentiation
pathways and infer the structure of a key gene regulatory network.

1 Introduction

Unraveling the dynamics of gene regulatory programs is a challeng—
ing problem, due to multitude of variables and mechanisms involved
in the gene control machinery. As genes represent fundamental units
in regulatory networks, the problem is commonly restricted to
understand how they interact and express themselves, to generate
specific biological functions. This gave rise to a variety of mathemat—
ical methods which, combined with experimental measurements,
provided a way to reconstruct gene regulatory processes and esti—
mate unknown kinetic parameters. Different classes of approaches
have been proposed, from ODE—based models (Honkela et (11., 2010;
Sanguinetti et (11., 2009) to stochastic models (Wilkinson, 2009),
and a number of optimization techniques have been developed for
inference and parameter estimation in gene regulatory models (Liepe
et (11., 2014; Ocone et (11., 2013; Stathopoulos and Girolami, 2012).
To learn network dynamics, all these models require temporal
data sources, such as mRNA or protein time—courses. However, as
recent advances in single—cell technologies offer the possibility to
analyse gene expression simultaneously in hundreds of individual
cells (Citri et (11., 2012), time—course data are not always available
for massive single—cell dataset. This prevents from using elaborated

methods developed in the last decades on data coming from newest
technologies such as single—cell RNA sequencing or high—throughput
quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Typically, data from such technologies are given in form of
single—cell snapshot data. Broadly, single—cell snapshot data consist
of gene expression measurements collected from multiple single cells
at a single time point. 50 defined, they represent static data which re—
ﬂect single—cell states at a single time point. However, as cells may
have different stochastic behaviours during the same process
(Elowitz et (11., 2002), a sort of temporal information is still retained
in snapshot data.

Here, we present a framework which allows to extract gene
regulatory dynamics directly from single—cell snapshot data. The
framework allows reconstruction of individual network nodes’ dy—
namics, estimation of kinetic parameters and computation of Bayes’
factors to determine how network nodes functionally interact.

The combination of dimensionality reduction with a clustering
method and an efficient algorithm to order single cells by time pro—
vides a way to reconstruct gene expression pseudo time courses
from different cellular processes. These are used to compare differ—
ent ODE—based transcriptional models and select the one which best

explains the data. As transcriptional models incorporate structural
knowledge in form of Boolean logic gates and presence/absence of
regulatory edges, the model selection step represents indeed a way to
refine the gene network structure.

In contrast to recently developed frameworks (Bendall et (11.,
2014; Trapnell et (11., 2014), we show how dynamics extracted from
single—cell snapshot data can be used to recover quantitative aspects
about the underlying regulatory network. We first test our frame—
work on two simulated datasets. The first consists of a feed—forward
loop (FFL) network motif, which exhibits the behaviour of a pulse
generator. The other dataset is generated by a more complex regula—
tory network, including toggle switches, which mimics the dynamics
of cell differentiation process.

Finally, we present an application on hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) data generated by a high—throughput single—cell quantitative
polymerase chain reaction experiment during cell differentiation
(Moignard et (11., 2013). We reconstruct both dynamics and struc—
ture of a key gene regulatory network (GRN) and show that our
framework provides biological insights not accessible through stand—
ard in silico analyses.

2 Modular framework for learning GRN dynamics

Our approach is based on a modular framework, depicted as a block
diagram in Figure 1. Gene expression single—cell snapshot data rep—
resent the input to the framework (Fig. 1A). The outcome of the
analysis is 2—fold: we estimate kinetic parameters for transcriptional
dynamics (Fig. 1H) and we refine the GRN topology (Fig. 1G).
Inferred GRN structure and parameters can eventually be used to
generate model predictions in presence of structural and/or dynam—
ical perturbations.

Each module in the framework performs a crucial function, which
is summarized below and described in detail in Supplementary
Information. The first module performs dimensionality reduction
(Fig. 1B), which allows to embed high—dimensional snapshot data into
a low—dimensional space. Here, we use a nonlinear method, known as

diffusion map (Coifman et (11., 2005), which represents the probabilis—
tic version of spectral clustering techniques (Nadler et (11., 2005). By
means of diffusion map, a large number of cells can be embedded and
visualized in a low—dimensional (i.e. 2D—3D) space, according to their
multivariate gene expression value. In this low—dimensional space,
similarity between cells is encoded by their Euclidean distance. In par—
ticular, by applying an ad hoc clustering method on the cells in low—
dimensional space (Fig. 1C), we are able to separate a number of
branches associated with different cellular processes (i.e. differenti—
ation pathways). The number and selection of branches depend on a
user—defined initial cell, therefore an approximate position of this cell
is required as prior information. Although this is generally not avail—
able, a prior knowledge of expression profile of key genes combined
with visual inspection in diffusion map embedding is generally suffi—
cient to locate an approximate initial cell.

As gene expression is a function of time, cells can potentially
also be ordered by time. We use a recently developed algorithm,
Wanderlust (Bendall et (11., 2014), to order single cells along discrete
paths, in branches identified in the embedded data space. These
paths do not represent real time but rather a pseudo time variable,
which depends on the intrinsic cellular process. As a result, we re—
construct gene expression dynamics of different genes in form of
pseudo time—series (Fig. 1D).

As Wanderlust works only for non—branching processes, the ad
hoc clustering method is necessary to separate multiple branches be—
fore ordering the cells by time. Note that Wanderlust is applied dir—
ectly on high—dimensional data; on the other hand, performance of
the clustering method in low—dimensional diffusion map embedding
is better than directly in high—dimensional data (see details in
Supplementary Information).

To learn gene regulatory dynamics from pseudo time—series data,
we describe gene expression dynamics of individual network nodes
using mathematical models. The choice of right level of model ab—
straction is crucial to achieve a certain task. Our application re—
quires a mathematical model, which is ﬂexible enough to explain
nonlinear gene expression dynamics and allows for an efficient and

accurate solution of the parameter estimation problem. To this aim,
we use the following ODE—based model to describe gene—gene

where x and y represent mRNA concentrations of input and target
gene, respectively. Kinetic parameter at represents production rate and
7t decay rate of target gene expression; 0 E (1917) are parameters of a
nonlinear Hill—type function f (x(t), 0) (Hao and O’Shea, 2011),
where K and 17 are dissociation constant and Hill coefficient, respect—
ively. [We assume that mRNA concentration y of target gene can be
used as proxy for concentration level of its active transcription factor
(TF). This is valid by considering that post—transcriptional modifica—
tions occur on a faster timescale with respect to transcription and
translation process. As a direct consequence, kinetics parameters in
Equation (1) will take into account of both transcription and transla—
tion mechanisms. Alternatively, statistical models where protein states
are treated as latent variables could be adopted (Ocone et (11., 2013).]

Generally, the expression of a target gene y is regulated by the
activity of a number M of inputs x,- (with i : 1, . . . ,M), which can
be combined according to different logical expressions. Therefore, a
wide range of possible models can be used to describe interactions
between M inputs on target y. The following models

W) : aanmeLem) — M. (3)

encode different logical expressions to combine M input genes, re—
spectively AND and OR logic gates. Generalization to mixtures of
different logical expressions is straightforward.

For parameter estimation, we use an approximation method
based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In each MCMC it—
eration, a Gaussian likelihood is computed using the solution y of
model ODEs at observation pseudo times. As we are considering a
network of interacting genes, likelihood computation turns to be a
recursive system, which we solve by using Gaussian process emula—
tors for input gene functions xm(t) (O’Hagan, 2006). In other
words, parameter estimation of a GRN with N genes is decomposed
in N different optimization problems correspondent to N subnet—
works. Each subnetvvork is composed of a single target gene, which
is regulated by a number of input genes. Given emulators for its in—
puts, each subnetvvork is conditionally independent on the others
(Georgoulas et (11., 2012). As the dimensionality of parameter space
is reduced in each subnetwork, this strategy turns to be very efficient
and scalable with GRN size.

To select which ODE model explains better pseudo time—series
data, parameter optimization is integrated with a model selection
step. In addition to more simple statistics as Akaike (AIC) and
Bayesian information criterions (BIC), we do Bayesian model com—
parison by computing Bayes’ factors through thermodynamic inte—
gration (Calderhead and Girolami, 2009).

As the number of ODE models to compare grows combinator—
ially with the number of genes, the amount of models is thinned out
by using a priori knowledge on GRN structure. We adopt GENIE3
(Huynh—Thu et (11., 2010), an efficient method based on random

forest, to obtain a coarse network structure, which we then refine
through model selection (Fig. 1E).

As the framework represents a combination of multiple methods
and each method depends on user—provided parameters, it is relevant
to evaluate how its global performance depends on these param—
eters. For this reason, we perform multiple tests on simulated data
to validate robustness of results to different parameter choices (see
Supplementary Information).

In the following sections, before applying our framework on real
data, we assess its performance on two synthetic datasets.

3 Simulated data: FFL network motifs

FFLs are three—gene networks which have been of large interest in
the recent literature (Alon, 2006; Ocone and Sanguinetti, 2011).
They are composed by a master TF gX, regulating a slave gene gy
and a target gene gz. The target gene is in turn regulated by the ac—
tivity of the slave TF gy_ As TFs can activate or inhibit their targets,
there can be eight possible FFL types according to the sign of the
three edges. Here, we focus on the incoherent type—I (11) FFL
(Fig. 2B), where the master TF activates both slave gy and target
gene gz, so that a positive activity of gX determines an increasing ex—
pression for gy and gz. However, as the target gene is repressed by
the slave TF gy, its expression starts decreasing to steady state level
as soon as gy expression is greater than a given threshold (which de—
pends on the parameters of gz activation function). As a conse—
quence, gz expression exhibits a pulse behaviour, which accelerates
the gene expression dynamics (Fig. 2D). This feature is so fundamen—
tal for accurate control of cellular processes that I1—FFL is one of the
two most common FFL types found in GRNs of Escherichia coli and
yeast (Mangan et (11., 2006).

We simulate single—cell snapshot data sets using an I1—FFL where
input genes gX and gy interact on the common target gz through an
OR logic gate. Stochastic realizations for N : 300 cells are generated
using Euler—Maruyama method and expression values for the three

genes at a random time point are used to create the single—cell snap—
shot data.

Dimensionality reduction is not necessary for FFLs, as cells can
be embedded in a 3D space where each dimension represents a gene
(Fig. 2C). Application of Wanderlust algorithm in this case is
straightforward, as cells are distributed along a single non—branching
path. This is essentially due to the fact that FFLs are not bistable sys—
tems like the ones we will discuss later on, but they always evolve
according to a characteristic dynamics.

To quantify how well cell time—ordering performs, we compare
expression values from pseudo time—series to expression values
obtained from deterministic FFL model simulation. Results in
Figure 2A show a good agreement between pseudo time and real
time; small discrepancies are due to the fact that we compare sto—
chastic data with a deterministic simulation where intrinsic noise is
null. Gene gz shows slightly larger discrepancies compared with gX
and gy, as its dynamics is more complex (i.e. overshoot dynamics in—
stead of monotonic functions) and time—ordering is less efficient.

Once a rough GRN structure is obtained through network infer—
ence, we aim to refine this structure. This is done by learning pres—
ence/absence of regulatory edges; uncertain regulatory edge signs
(i.e. activation/inhibition); logical interaction occurring between
master and slave TFs on target gene promoter. By using transcrip—
tional models with single/multiple inputs, with AND—gate and OR—
gate (Eq. 2 and 3), we estimate kinetic parameters and do model
selection.

Model selection results are reported in Supplementary
Information. For models with highest AIC/BIC values, marginal
likelihoods have also been computed for Bayesian model compari—
son. Bayes’ factor between OR—gate and AND—gate FFL results
ROR/AND > 100. According to Jeffrey’s interpretation (Jeffreys,
1961), a Bayes’ factor ROR/AND > 100 clearly shows that transcrip—
tional model with OR—gate can explain pseudo time—series recon—
structed from OR—gate I1—FFL snapshot data decisively better than
competitive AND—gate model. Results are validated by visual inspec—
tion through fitting with optimized parameters (Fig. 2D).

The goodness of fitting for favoured models is also reﬂected in
estimated parameter values. Parameter posterior distributions are re—
ported in Figure 3, together with true parameters used to simulate
snapshot data. Average of relative errors, computed using maximum
a posteriori estimates, is around 17%. However, parameter estima—
tion performance is mixed: mode of posterior distributions for some
parameters is very close to true values, whereas for other param—
eters, such as Hill coefficients [7, it is not as good. Variations of Hill
coefficients [7 determine only small changes in the slope of gz expres—
sion overshoot, therefore even small error sources in gene expression
values or pseudo time reconstruction make estimation of lo nontri—
vial. Plots of bivariate marginal distributions (Fig. 3, left) show high
correlation between parameters at and 7». Although we are not able
to recover their true values, nonetheless the ratio between their pos—
terior estimates is exactly the true one (Fig. 3, right). The problem
can be reduced by placing an informative Gaussian prior over decay
rate parameter 7»; in this case parameter estimation improves and re—
duce the average of relative errors to 14.5%.

To assess predictive power of our framework, we have used
inferred GRN structure and estimated parameters to generate pre—
dictions under different perturbed conditions. Perturbations can be
in the form of structural changes of the network and/or in the form
of dynamical changes, e.g. variation of kinetic parameters values.
Furthermore, single perturbations can be combined to obtain simul—
taneous perturbations. Here, we consider three perturbations: dele—
tion of slave gene gy; gene knockdown to achieve 3—fold increase in

and estimated parameters. A detailed procedure is reported in
Supplementary Information. Predicted dynamics under perturbation
conditions fit very well to observations from true perturbed system
(Fig. 4), proving that dynamic information extracted from snapshot
data of FFLs can be used to generate useful predictions.

Our results show that, using high—dimensional single—cell snapshot
data, our framework provides a way to reconstruct gene expression
dynamics and learn logic gates in FFL network motifs. FFLs represent
a simple example; in the next section we demonstrate the power of
our framework on a more complex regulatory network.

4 Simulated data: toggle switch network

A toggle switch is a double—negative loop motif composed by two
genes repressing each other (Gardner et (11., 2000). Because of its ro—
bust bistable dynamics, this motif is useful in systems such as the
lysis—lysogeny switch in 7t—phage (Ptashne and Gann, 2002) and it is
believed to be actively present in GRNs regulating stem cells differ—
entiation (Wang et (11., 2009).

Here we consider a six—gene network which mimics the process
of decision making during stem cells differentiation (Fig. 1G). The
network includes three toggle switches in a symmetrical hierarchical
structure: toggle switch gA — g3, at an early differentiation stage,
controls the state of two toggle switches gc — gD and g3 — gp, at a

late differentiation stage. Expression of late stage genes, gc, gD, gE
and gp, reﬂects the commitment to four different cell fates. For each
differentiation path, only a single late stage gene is expressed, de—
pending on the state of upstream toggle switches. For example,
when toggle switch gA — g3 activates gA transcription, then gA and
g3 expressions will increase and decrease, respectively. As a conse—
quence, genes gc and gD will both start to be transcribed, until tog—
gle switch gc — gD will keep activating only one gene and repressing
the other one. This mechanism of expressing only gC (or gD) works
because edges on late stage genes are combined through logic AND
gates.

We again reconstruct GRN dynamics and refine its structure, by
using simulated single—cell snapshot data and prior GRN structural
information obtained though network inference. Snapshot data are
simulated with 400 cells and same kinetic parameters for all three
toggle switches. Application of diffusion map algorithm and selec—
tion of first three eigenvectors produces an embedding where four
branches correspondent to the different cell fates can be clearly iden—
tified (Fig. 1B). Pseudo time—series are finally reconstructed for each
branch, through Wanderlust algorithm (Fig. 5).

As kinetic parameters are the same for each toggle switch, we
focus only on a single gene, gc, and learn how inputs genes (i.e. gA
and gD), are combined on gc activation function. We compare all
possible transcriptional models, with single or double inputs and
with different logic gates (Fig. 6, left). During model selection, par—
ameters are optimized by using pseudo time—series from branches
where gc expression exhibits a dynamic behaviour (Fig. 6, right), i.e.
two branches where gA has high expression levels. Model selection
results (Fig. 6, left) show that the transcriptional model with activat—
ing input gA and inhibiting input gD, combined through AND gate,
is clearly favoured with respect to all the other models. Analogous
results have been obtained for gene gD (reported in Supplementary
Information).

Parameter estimation is performed using simultaneously gC and
gD pseudo time—series, with transcriptional AND—gate models for
both gc and gD activation function. Means of parameter posterior
distributions (Fig. 1H) reﬂect true parameter values (average of rela—
tive errors is around 6.8%), except again for Hill coefficients. By
using more than a single branch for the optimization, the problem of
correlation between parameters 01 and 7» is reduced. To improve the
accuracy of parameter estimation, our approach should be com—
bined with a specific experimental design (Silk et (11., 2014), but this
is out of the scope of this work.

As mentioned above, these results have been obtained using
pseudo time—series from two (out of four) branches. By using all four

branches, the estimation accuracy should further increase, but that
is nontrivial, as gene gC expression in the remaining two branches is
just noise.

Another way to improve parameter estimation would be to con—
sider a time—shift error produced by the time—ordering algorithm. An
adjusted time—ordering method would require a study on the diffu—
sion maps topology, which will be deferred to a further work.
However, the accuracy of pseudo time—series reconstruction per—
formed here is adequate for both model selection and reconstruction
of transcriptional dynamics.

To assess the robustness of the framework, we performed ana—
lyses on different simulated dataset obtained by changing both ob—
servation noise level and noise model. Results show that parameter
estimation accuracy is consistent over the different datasets (full de—
tails in Supplementary Information).

Here, we showed how our framework is able to get rid of bi—
modal gene expression (due to presence of multiple toggle switches)
and recover dynamics of a more complex 6—gene GRN. As in the
FFL case, by using reconstructed pseudo time—series and ODE—based
transcriptional models, we were also able to select correct logics in
the transcriptional activation function.

5 Logic learning in a hematopoietic GRN

Understanding stem cell differentiation is fundamental for advances
in cell reprogramming research, with potentially practical applica—
tions in regenerative medicine and drug development (Cherry and
Daley, 2012; Inoue and Yamanaka, 2011). In particular, mechan—
isms of cellular decision making are regulated by multiple dynamics
of underlying GRNs. A paradigm for studying how these dynamics
give rise to different cells fates is represented by blood cell formation
process, known as hematopoiesis (Orkin and Zon, 2008).

Recently, Moignard et al. (2013) analyzed the expression of 18
key genes in 597 single cells isolated from mouse bone marrow.
Cells were belonging to multiple stages during differentiation
(Fig. 7A), from HSCs to four different progenitor cell populations:
pre—megakaryocytderythroid progenitors (PreMegE), lymphoid—
primed multipotent progenitors (LMPP), granulocyte—macrophage
progenitors (GMP) and common lymphoid progenitor (CLP). They
clustered cells according to expression states characteristic of each
cell population and performed correlation analysis to infer GRN
regulatory links. In particular, they predicted strong correlations be—
tween TFs GATA2, GF11 and GF11B, which were then validated
using transcription and transgenic assays.

inference on snapshot data

Here, we focus on this regulatory triad (GATA2, GF11 and
GFIlB) and refine the subnetwork underpinning its dynamics during
differentiation.

Figure 7B shows the embedding of single cells after dimensional—
ity reduction with diffusion map algorithm and selection of first, se—
cond and third eigenvectors (i.e. diffusion components). Colours
indicate different cell types, identified using cell surface markers
(Cell surface markers are also used to separate branches, without
need of a clustering method.). Two features can be observed: first,
diffusion map is able to separate different cell types; second, the
3D embedding consists of three noisy but well—defined branches.
Although it may wrongly seem that four branches are present in the
embedding, in reality the fourth branch is composed of HSC
cells and represents the starting point of the process. The three
branches clearly show the three cell differentiation pathways as
reported in Figure 7A: HSC —> PreMegE, HSC —> LMPP —> GMP
and HSC —> LMPP —> CLP. For sake of clarity, in the following we
refer to these pathways as PreMegE, GMP and CLP, respectively.
Among these pathways, we consider only pathways GMP and
CLP, since reconstructed GFI1 pseudo time—series exhibit no dynam—
ical behaviour during differentiation to PreMegE (Supplementary
Fig. 519).

Network inference through GENIE3 algorithm and correlation
analysis generate GRN in Figure 7C, where TFs of interest are high—
lighted by a yellow circle. For each of these TFs, we aim to compare
different ODE models by combining different features: presence of
single/multiple inputs on target gene; positive/negative edge sign and
logical interactions (AND/OR gates and their combinations). A
comprehensive list of all tested models is reported in Supplementary
Information.

Results for target GATA2 have been obtained using pseudo
time—series from pathway CLP. In fact, in dynamics reconstructed
using pathway GMP, SCL exhibits residual bimodal expression and
NFE2 a nearly ﬂat profile. On the other hand, expression of GATA1
remains always at very low values in both pseudo time—series from
CLP and GMP, therefore we do not take it into account.

Model selection favours two inputs inﬂuencing GATA2 expres—
sion: the first is a direct activation by SCL and the second is a direct
inhibition by GF11. Results are promising, as these interactions have
been known or experimentally validated (Moignard et (11., 2013).
On the other hand, a third predicted input, given by logical AND
gate between GFI1 and NFE2, opens new questions to be investi—
gated in laboratory.

Model selection for targets GFI1 and GFI1B have been per—
formed using only pseudo time—series from pathway GMP, as input
GF11B exhibits bimodal expression in pathway CLP.

Results for target GFI1 show that only inhibitor GFIlB inﬂu—
ences GFI1 expression. This interaction is part of a toggle switch be—
tween GF11 and GFI1B (Moignard et (11., 2013).

The structure of this toggle switch is fully predicted, since also
model selection for target GFI1B favours negative regulation of
GF11B by GF11. Furthermore, results for target GFI1B predict also
positive regulation of GFI1B by GATA2, so that GATA2 carries out
a modulating function for the toggle switch, as experimentally vali—
dated in (Moignard et (11., 2013). However, a combinatorial model
involving both GF11 and GATA2 to regulate GFI1B is not predicted.
Possibly, toggle switch GFI1—GFI1B represents such a central role in
hematopoietic differentiation, that inﬂuence of a third regulator (i.e.
GATA2) is included through a function more complex than AND/
OR logic gates.

each TF, selected edges are reported with corresponding data set
from which results have been obtained. Fitting results are showed in
Figure 9 and full details of transcriptional models are reported in
Supplementary Information.

Reconstructing gene regulatory dynamics from high—dimensional single—cell snapshot data i95

 

In summary, using dynamical information from GMP and CLP
pathways, we are able to reconstruct gene expression dynamics dur—
ing haematopoiesis. Pseudo time—series show how TFs behave during
differentiation along pathways GMP and CLP. This reﬂects know—
ledge about gene expression of key TFs: for example GATA2 is
known to be expressed at high levels in HSCs but at lower levels in
LMPPs and GMPs. Furthermore, we are also able to refine the key
subnetwork for the regulatory triad GATA2, GF11 and GFIlB.
Regulatory edges were not only evaluated in terms of sign but also
directionality. On the other hand, directed edges were not predicted
in Moignard et al. (2013) but only experimentally validated. Our
framework also provides new testable hypothesis regarding inter—
actions of TFs on target genes promoters, as in the case of TFs NFE2
and GFI1 for target GATA2.

6 Discussion

As mathematical modelling is becoming more and more crucial in
supporting experimental research in systems biology, computational
frameworks need to constantly evolve and adapt to new technolo—
gies. In this context, recent advances in high—dimensional single—cell
technologies are providing massive amount of data in form of sin—
gle—cell snapshot data. Although a number of statistical tools have
been developed to model gene expression in snapshot data, they
were only able to provide limited insights into biological mechan—
isms. In particular, as snapshot data do not directly represent how
concentration of molecular species changes over time, present meth—
ods are only able to extract static information from data.

Here, we have presented a framework which allows to recon—
struct dynamics of gene network nodes from single—cell gene expres—
sion snapshot data. By combining a dimensionality reduction
method with an algorithm to time—order single cells, we are able to
reconstruct pseudo time—series which provide a good approximation
to time—series simulated from the real system. Through an efficient
optimization strategy, pseudo time—series are then used to calibrate
nonlinear ODE models which explain complex transcriptional dy—
namics. Furthermore, by computing Bayes’ factors, we are also able
to refine GRNs structures by selecting among transcriptional models
with different structural information, i.e. different logic gates in acti—
vation functions.

The framework is modular and requires a number of sequential
steps, which are independent on each other. This has the advantage
that each step can be independently improved, without reducing the
efficiency of the entire workﬂow. Many of these steps, especially
dimensionality reduction techniques and parameter estimation
methods, have already been studied in great detail. However, to the
best of our knowledge, similar comprehensive frameworks have not
been yet developed: our idea represents the first example of quanti—
tative modelling GRNs dynamics without using protein or gene ex—
pression time—courses but only high—dimensional single—cell snapshot
data. Only recently, some approaches have been developed to ana—
lyse high—dimensional biological data (Amir et al., 2013) and their
underlying dynamics (Amat et al., 2014; Bendall et al.., 2014;
Trapnell et al.., 2014) but purely for a visualization purpose or
qualitative analyses.

Analysis on multiple simulated data sets demonstrates that we
are able to infer kinetic parameters describing the underlying dy—
namics and recover logic gates in activation functions. Results on
single—cell snapshot data obtained during blood stem cell differenti—
ation show that we can reconstruct gene expression dynamics along
differentiation pathways. Compared with competing strategies, we

can not only determine correlations among genes in the GRN but
also predict edge directions. In particular, GATA2 was predicted to
be inhibited by GFI1 and to activate GFI1B, thus possibly working
as a modulator of the known toggle switch between GFI1 and
GFI1B. Gene GATA2 has been found to be involved in myeloid leu—
kaemia (Hahn et al., 2011); a better understanding of its role will
not only help to get more insights into cell decision making but also
to gain more knowledge about cancer pathologies.

From the computational point of view, our work opens possibil—
ities to several further developments. Although diffusion maps
have been proved to resolve nonlinear differences in single—cell ex—
pression data (Moignard et al., 2015), an improvement in the time—
ordering algorithm would substantially reduce the error in pseudo
time—series. In addition, at the statistical modelling level, we have
considered ODE—based transcriptional models without taking into
account of intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression. Single cells pro—
vide more information with respect to cell populations, but such in—
formation could be retrieved only by using stochastic models of gene
expression. On the other hand, parameter estimation and model se—
lection with stochastic models are challenging and will require more
advanced methods compared with those used in this work (Liepe
et al., 2014).

Despite we restricted the analysis to small/medium size GRNs,
we believe that our work may evolve to the analysis of larger net—
work and with more complex dynamics, e.g. including feedback
loops. A greedy—type strategy could be adopted in model selection to
cope with a larger number of dynamical models. However, an inte—
gration of structure inference and dynamics modelling would remain
challenging in the case of larger networks (Oates et al., 2014).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The computational evaluation of candidate genes for her-
editary disorders is a non-trivial task. Several excellent methods for
disease-gene prediction have been developed in the past 2 decades,
exploiting widely differing data sources to infer disease-relevant func-
tional relationships between candidate genes and disorders. We have
shown recently that spatially mapped, i.e. 3D, gene expression data
from the mouse brain can be successfully used to prioritize candidate
genes for human Mendelian disorders of the central nervous system.
Results: We improved our previous work 2-fold: (i) we demonstrate
that condition-independent transcription factor binding affinities of the
candidate genes’ promoters are relevant for disease-gene prediction
and can be integrated with our previous approach to significantly en-
hance its predictive power; and (ii) we define a novel similarity meas-
ure—termed Relative Intensity Overlap—for both 3D gene expression
patterns and binding affinity profiles that better exploits their
disease-relevant information content. Finally, we present novel
disease-gene predictions for eight loci associated with different syn-
dromes of unknown molecular basis that are characterized by mental
retardation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although experimental methodologies for the identiﬁcation of
disease-causing mutations have significantly improvediin par-
ticular by the recently introduced next-generation sequencing
techniquesazomputational approaches to an in silico evaluation
of candidate genes remain an important aid for the identiﬁcation
of genes involved in human hereditary disorders (Kann, 2010;
Piro et al., 2011; Piro and Di Cunto, 2012). A large variety of
computational methods have been developed for this purpose,
exploiting various data sources ranging from MEDLINE ab-
stracts, functional gene annotation, proteiniprotein interactions
and high-throughput gene expression data to intrinsic gene or

protein properties (such as coding sequence length, number of
introns, conservation and so forth). For more information on
available disease-gene prediction tools and methods, we refer
to some recent reviews (Kann, 2010; Piro and Di Cunto, 2012).

To a large extent, cellular homeostasis depends on coordinated
gene expression, both in space and time. Gene expression deter-
mines where and when the molecular function of a gene product
is exerted. For this reason, gene expression patterns have been
successfully exploited by several computational disease-gene pre-
diction methods (Kann, 2010; Piro and Di Cunto, 2012).

In our previous work (Piro et al., 2010), we have shown that
the high-resolution 3D gene expression patterns provided by the
Allen Institute’s Mouse Brain Atlas (MBA) (Lein et al., 2007)
can be used to successfully prioritize not only candidate genes for
mouse phenotypes but also for human Mendelian disorders of
the central nervous system (CNS). Brieﬂy, we prioritized the
candidate genes from a mapped ‘orphan’ locus of a disease
phenotype with unknown molecular basis by comparing their
3D gene expression patterns to those of a set of ‘reference
genes’, known to be involved in similar disease phenotypes.

The condition and sample dependency of gene expression pro-
ﬁles constitutes a desired feature for the prediction of functional
relationships between genes. A complementary View, and hence
additional clues to gene functions, may instead be provided by
condition-independent regulatory information, obtained from
promoter analysis (Werner, 2003). Classically, position frequency
matrices (PFMs) or their associated position weight matrices
(PWMs) that describe transcription factor (TF) binding sites are
used to scan promoters for short, often degenerate, regulatory
elements. In many cases, genome-wide PWM scans require strin-
gent criteria to limit the false-discovery rate and to yield an ac-
ceptable speciﬁcity. This can lead to reduced sensitivity and likely
misses low-afﬁnity binding sites ﬂ-Iannenhalli, 2008), which have
been shown to be abundant and functional in vivo (Tanay, 2006).

An alternative approach builds on the notion of an overall
likelihood that a promoter is bound by a given TF, without
requiring the identiﬁcation of one or more well-deﬁned regula-
tory elements (Foat et al., 2006; Molineris et al., 2011; Ward and
Bussemaker, 2008), thus better reflecting the thermodynamic
nature of TF binding (Segal et al., 2008). For this purpose, a
total binding aﬂinity (TBA) for the TF’s PFM can be calculated
over the entire promoter, taking into account the collective

contribution of (potential) high- and low-afﬁnity binding sites,
without strictly drawing a line between binding and non-binding
sites. In a recent study, we showed TBA to be predictive of TF-
binding events, as revealed by ChIP/chip and ChIP/seq experi-
ments (Molineris et al., 2011).

Here, we introduce the notion of TF binding co-aﬂinity of a
pair of genes that we compute from the genes’ TBA profiles
composed of their binding afﬁnities for a core set of TFs. We
show that these co-afﬁnities can decipher the disease relevance of
candidate genes for human hereditary disorders and further im-
prove the predictive power by developing a new similarity meas-
ure termed Relative Intensity Overlap (RIO). We combine this
approach with the prioritization based on spatially mapped, i.e.
3D, gene expression, applying it to several disorders of unknown
molecular basis characterized by mental retardation (MR).

2 METHODS

2.1 Disease phenotypes and gene—disease associations

Information on human Mendelian disease phenotypes was obtained from
the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database (Amberger
et al., 2009) on August 15, 2011, limited to those that contain the term
‘central nervous system’ in their clinical synopsis section and have at least
one mapped disease locus. Note that this selection criterion does not
exclude other organs and tissues from being affected, i.e. symptoms
need not be limited to the CNS. A total of 867 OMIM phenotype entries
with known molecular basis (OMIM symbol: #) were downloaded.
Associated disease-related genes were determined by merging information
from the OMIM Morbidmap and Entrez Gene (Sayers et al., 2012)
(mim2gene), yielding 948 CNS-related gen&phenotype (gip) pairs.
Additionally, we obtained all phenotype entries for various syndromes
with an unknown molecular basis (OMIM symbol: %) that contain the
term ‘mental retardation’ (MR) in their title ﬁeld and have been mapped
to a disease locus containing a set of candidate genes.

As our aim was to predict the most likely candidates for mapped
‘orphan’ loci from OMIM phenotype entries with so far unknown mole-
cular basis, in which no genes are known to be involved, we used disease-
associated genes from similar phenotype entries as reference genes for the
prediction procedure described later in the text. For this purpose, we
measured the pairwise similarity of OMIM phenotypes using
MimMiner, essentially as described by van Driel et a]. (2006).
MimMiner scores are normalized and range from 0 (unrelated) to 1
(highly related or identical). Instead of the minimum score of 0.4 pro-
posed by van Driel et a]. to deﬁne phenotype similarity, we applied a
more stringent threshold of 0.5 to focus on more relevant reference genes.

For the ex novo candidate gene prioritizations that we present here, we
restricted our analysis to eight representative orphan disease loci for both
X-linked and autosomal MR that had at least two reference genes from
similar phenotypes and at least 20 candidate genes for which both gene
expression and afﬁnity data were available (see later in the text).

2.2 3D gene expression data

3D gene expression proﬁles for the MBA (Lein et al., 2007) were down-
loaded on February 2, 2011 using the application programming interface
provided by the Allen Institute’s website at http://mouse.brain-map.org/.
Only sagittal image series with antisense probes for genes with deﬁned
Entrez gene IDs were considered. In case of multiple image series per
gene, only the most recent series was used. The downloaded expression
patterns provide expression levels for the entire brain, smoothed over
evenly spaced voxels (cubes) with a side length of 200 pm.

As we applied the mouse expression data for prioritizing human dis-
ease genes, we mapped expression proﬁles from the mouse brain to
human Entrez gene IDs using unambiguous mappings from NCBI’s
HomoloGene (build 65) (Sayers et al., 2012), yielding 14590 human
Entrez gene IDs with an associated expression pattern from the mouse
brain. From these, we excluded 68 genes that had no corresponding TBA
proﬁles (see later in the text).

3D expression patterns from the MBA consist only of non-negative
values (:0) that we normalized as follows: for each proﬁle, we ﬁrst sorted
all positive expression levels (>0) in increasing order and then set the
95th percentile to a value of 0.95 (to avoid taking outliers into account
for normalization). All other expression values were scaled linearly by the
same factor. Expression levels that exceeded 1 after scaling were inter-
preted as potential outliers and limited to equal 1.

2.3 Brain region-speciﬁc gene expression

To evaluate the performance of different correlation measures in cluster-
ing spatial expression proﬁles, we used sets of genes that exhibit region-
speciﬁc expression in the mouse brain. Of the top 100 genes for each of 12
brain regions, deﬁned by Lein et a]. (2007), we retained only those that
could be unambiguously mapped to human genes (see earlier in the text),
obtaining between 77 and 92 (on average 84) genes per region.

We then used a rank-based procedure to construct ranked co-expres-
sion groups (RCGs; Miozzi et al., 2008) for all 14522 genes, each being
composed of the gene that deﬁnes the RCG plus the k genes with the most
correlated 3D gene expression proﬁles (where correlation is deﬁned by one
of the tested similarity measures). Varying k from 1 to 100, we scanned the
RCGs for gene pairs from the 12 brain region-speciﬁc gene sets.

2.4 Total binding afﬁnity and co-afﬁnity

As described in our recent study on the evolution of promoteriTF afﬁ-
nity, for each human transcription start site, we consider the region span-
ning 1500 bp upstream to 500 bp downstream as promoter, but the
approach is robust with respect to the choice of promoter size
(Molineris et al., 2011).

Following Foat et a]. (2006), we deﬁne the TBA a", of a promoter r
for a transcription factor, represented by its position frequency matrix
(PFM) w, as:

Lil [ l I
P(W'v ri+') P(Wlij+1, ri+.)
arw = [0 max #, —J 1
g;  PU), n+1)  P(b, r, +1.) ( )

I

where L is the length of the promoter, 1 is the length of the PFM, r,- is the
nucleotide at position i of the promoter and r;— is the nucleotide at the
same position on the opposite strand.

The probability P(wj, r,-+j) to observe a given nucleotide r,-+j at promo-
ter position i +j also at position j of the PFM w is computed as the
PFM’s frequency count of the nucleotide at Wj, divided by the total
frequency count for all four nucleotides at W). In the case of a frequency
count of zero, we add a pseudocount of 1. P(wj, r,-+j) is corrected for the
background probability P(b, n+1) of r,-+j, computed as the nucleotide
frequency for the whole intergenic part of the human genome.

For genes with multiple promoters r (i.e. multiple transcription start
sites), we set the gene’s TBA agw for a given PFM w (i.e. a given tran-
scription factor or transcription factor family) to the maximum value
obtained for its individual promoters rk, i.e.

agw = max(ar[Wa - - - 7 arnmw) 

where n(g) is the number of promoters r of gene g. This is biologically
reasonable because a single promoter of the gene is in principle sufﬁcient
to drive its expression (although the promoter may allow to produce only
some of the possible isoforms of the gene).

R.M.Piro et al.

 

As afﬁnities from different PFMs are in most cases not directly com-
parable [because of widely differing lengths l and nucleotide frequencies
P(wj)],we ﬁnally apply a z-transformation to the TBA scores agw, such
that each gene g’s TBA is represented by the direction and number of
standard deviations it differs from the mean TBA a, for the given PFM w.

We computed TBAs of 130 non-redundant vertebrate PFMs deposited
in the Jaspar Core database (Bryne et al., 2008) for 37 231 human pro-
moters deﬁned by transcription start sites from RefSeq (Pruitt et al.,
2007). We could map the RefSeq IDs to 22 120 Entrez gene IDs (using
only unambiguous mappings). Consequently, each gene g can be
described by a TBA proﬁle Zig = (agwl, am, ..., agwm) composed of its
(z-transformed) afﬁnities for the transcription factors represented by the
PFMs [Equations (1) and (2)]. However, we limit the evaluation presented
here to those 14 522 genes, i.e. TBA proﬁles, for which MBA proﬁles are
also available (see earlier in the text).

Similar to the co-expression between two genes that can be estimated
from their gene expression proﬁles, we deﬁne the co-affinity of two genes
as the similarity of their TBA proﬁles (with different possible measures of
similarity). To this notion of co-afﬁnity, we can apply the same candidate
gene prioritization and leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) proce-
dures deﬁned for gene expression (see later in the text).

2.5 Relative intensity overlap
We deﬁne the R10 of two 3D gene expression proﬁles a and b (that can
be thought of as 3D images) as follows:

201,. > 12,.)

xyz

Z (max(iI;,.i. 112,»)2

xyz

RIO(a, b) = (3)

where [310,2 and If”! are intensities, i.e. expression levels, at voxel xyz
for genes a and b, respectively, and sums 2,0,2 are calculated over
all voxels.

Interpretation: The RIO measures the overlap of two (normalized) 3D
gene expression proﬁles by multiplying them with each other and sum-
ming the contributions of the single voxels to an overall score. This score
is then normalized through division by the maximum possible overlap
that would be obtained if both proﬁles had for each voxel the higher
expression level of the two. This way, a maximum contribution to the
score can be obtained for 1;}! = If”: 2 1, whereas voxels with low expres-
sion values (1;)! = [5’07 8 0) will neither give signiﬁcant contributions nor
are explicitly penalized. Voxels with maximally discordant expression
(e.g. [310,2 2 1 and [Zyz = 0), instead, will yield no contribution but max-
imum penalization [maximum summand for the denominator in
Equation (3)].

Analogously, we deﬁne the R10 of two TBA proﬁles m and n as in
Equation (3), using as intensities the (z-transformed) TBAs amw and am,
and summing over the PFMs w instead of summing over voxels.

Note that RIOs can range from 0 to 1 if the intensities are non-negative
quantities (as is the case for the MBA expression data) or from —1 to 1 if
the intensities can include negative values (as is the case for the z-trans-
formed TBAs) because in the latter case, discordant intensities can yield

negative contributions (if, e.g. amw > 0 and am, < 0).

2.6 Candidate gene prioritization

For both MBA and TBA proﬁles, we use the candidate gene prioritiza-
tion method, outlined in Figure 1, that we deﬁned in our previous study
for 3D gene expression proﬁles (Piro et al., 2010).

Brieﬂy, for each reference gene r e R , selected for a given OMIM
disease phenotype [7 (via MimMiner; see earlier in the text), all other
genes are ranked according to the similarity of their MBA or TBA pro-
ﬁles, respectively, to obtain one genome-wide, ranked co-expression or
co-afﬁnity list for each r (columns in Fig. 1). For this purpose, proﬁle

similarity can be deﬁned in various ways, for example, by the Pearson
correlation coefﬁcient [PCC; used in Piro et a]. (2010) for the MBA data]
or the R10 that we propose here (see earlier in the text).

The given set of candidate genes C1, (e.g. candidates from an orphan
disease locus) has now to be prioritized, i.e. ranked, according to their
likelihood of being involved in [7. We apply the following procedure: the
rank/position k(c, r) of each candidate gene c e C], within each of the
ranked profile similarity lists (columns) of the reference genes r is deter-
mined, and a relative rank k(c, r) /km,,x computed, where km,” is the total
number of genes in the ranked lists. Subsequently, each candidate gene is
assigned an overall score s5, determined as the product of its relative
ranks within the reference genes’ co-expression or co-afﬁnity lists,

s. = 1‘[ M (4)

YER], max

and candidates are sorted, i.e. prioritized, according to their increasing
overall score, thus giving precedence to lower scores (as lower scores
indicate better rankings in the single proﬁle similarity lists and, therefore,
a higher probability of being functionally related to the reference genes).
For more details, see Piro et a]. (2010).

2.7 Leave-one-out cross validation

To demonstrate the validity of our approachiincluding the new similar-
ity measure and the prediction based on afﬁnity proﬁlesiwe performed
large-scale LOOCVs for all known genedisease phenotype associations
(gip pairs) regarding CNS-related Mendelian disorders from OMIM (see
earlier in the text). For each gip pair, we removed all genedisease asso-
ciations of p and constructed an ‘artiﬁcial locus’ containing the disease-
related gene g itself plus the N closest genes on both sides of the chromo-
some (for N = 50, N = 100, N = 200 and N = 400), hence, simulating an
orphan locus of at most 2N + 1 genes (or less for g close to a chromo-
some terminal) linked to an OMIM phenotype of unknown molecular
basis. Then, we prioritized the candidates from the artiﬁcial loci and
veriﬁed the absolute rank (72g) and relative rank 72;”, (=rank 72g divided
by the number of candidates) of the true disease-related gene g within the
prioritized candidate list.

The analysis was limited to gen&phenotype pairs whose correspond-
ing artiﬁcial loci contain at least 50 ‘effective’ candidate genes for which
both MBA and TBA proﬁles are available~one of which was required to
be g itselfias only these can be evaluated and thus prioritized. For a
lower number of effective candidate genes, an undesired bias would tend
to automatically place the true phenotype-causing gene g in high ranks
72g. See Table 1 for the number of gen&phenotype pairs that could be
evaluated.

2.8 Integration of candidate rankings

To obtain overall rankings for a given set of candidate genes, we ﬁrst
compute distinct candidate rankings for the MBA-based and the TBA-
based approach, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 1. For each candi-
date gene c, we determine its (predicted) ranks  and  from the two
ranked candidate lists (M: MBA, T: TBA). Using an adaptation of the
generalized noisy-OR gate deﬁned by Diez (1993), we compute the con-
ditional probability that c ’5 true rank  is 1 (i.e. c is the true disease
gene) as

P02: = 1|Rf,",1ZL,T) = P02: = 1172;”) . P02: = H723) (5)

i.e. the probability that c is the true disease gene conditionally on having
been ranked at position  for the MBA, multiplied by the probability
that it is the true disease gene given that it has been ranked at position 
for the TBA. We determine the probability P02: 2 HR?) for each single
dataset D e (M, T) empirically from the leave-one-out performance over
all evaluated geneiphenotype pairs (g, p) as

prevent probabilities from becoming nil, we add a pseudocount of one.

Finally, we determine an integrated candidate gene list by prioritizing
the candidates c according to their decreasing probability [Equation (5)]
of being the true disease gene. For disambiguation, candidate genes with
equal probabilities P02: 2 H7224, R?) are further prioritized according
to their ranks  and  for the individual datasets (TBA or MBA),
giving precedence to candidates with better single rankings.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Promoter—TF binding afﬁnities are predictive

We performed LOOCVs over all known CNS-related genewlis-
ease associations to verify whether TBA profiles can actually aid
in prioritizing candidate genes from known disease loci. At the
same time, we asked whether the frequently used PCC or our
new similarity measure, the RIO, would better suit this task. For
this purpose, we constructed artiﬁcial candidate loci of various
sizes around each known disease gene and compared the candi-
dates’ TBA profiles with those of related reference genes, using
either PCC or RIO as similarity measure.

As demonstrated in Table 1a, TBA profiles are indeed predic-
tive and can be used to successfully prioritize candidate genes.
Furthermore, our new similarity measure RIO outperforms the
PCC for all locus sizes and for all evaluated categories of disease-
gene rankings (ﬁrst, top three, top 10 and best 10%). The
number of disease genes correctly being ranked ﬁrst, for exam-
ple, is increased by 477333% depending on the locus size.
Likewise, RIO outperforms both the Spearman rank correlation
(SRC) and the cosine-similarity (COS), as shown in
Supplementary Table Sla. Thus, for comparing binding affinity
profiles, we chose to use our new similarity measure.

3.2 RIO for predictions based on 3D gene expression

The measurement of proﬁle similarity is of major interest also
when applying 3D gene expression patterns to evaluate which
candidate genes are more likely to be functionally associated with
a given disorder. We asked whether RIO outperforms PCCi
used both in our previous work (Piro et al., 2010) and by the
Allen Institute (Lein et al., 2007Fin clustering spatial expression
profiles and predicting likely candidates for CNS-related disor-
ders. In addition, we compared the results with those obtained
for SRC and COS.

To evaluate the performance in clustering spatial expression
profiles, we constructed RCGs (Miozzi et al., 2008) of varying
sizes k + 1 (k = 1 to 100) for all genes and all four proﬁle simi-
larity measures, and we counted the number of pairs of genes
within these RCGs known to be specifically expressed in the
same brain region (see Section 2). Figure 2 shows that for the
MBA, RIO can consistently better recover region-speciﬁc rela-
tionships between gene expression patterns. For RCGs consist-
ing only of each gene plus it’s genome-wide most correlated gene
(k = 1), for example, RIO identiﬁes 233 gene pairs speciﬁcally
expressed in the same brain region, whereas PCC, COS and SRC
identify only 199, 180 and 153, respectively.

tation regarding brain region-speciﬁc gene expression is plotted over the
RCGs’ size parameter k (see Section 2)

For evaluating RIO’s impact on predicting likely candidates
for CNS-related disorders, we performed additional LOOCVs.
As shown in Table 1b, RIO performs comparably with PCC with
respect to true disease-associated genes that are ranked among
the first three, ﬁrst 10 or the best 10% of the candidate genes
from artiﬁcial loci. Furthermore, when considering disease-genes
that are ranked first among the set of candidatesithe ones that
would preferably be evaluated by geneticists on the search for
causes of hereditary diseaseiRIO clearly outperforms PCC
(increase of 1244%). In this regard, it also compares favourably
with both SRC and COS, as shown in Supplementary Table Slb.
Therefore, in the following sections, we used our new similarity
measure also for this type of gene expression data.

However, the performance improvement of the RIO depends
on a proper normalization of the 3D gene expression data. For
the LOOCV results for raw MBA proﬁles along with a discus-
sion, see the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Table
S2 and accompanying text).

3.3 Complementarity of MBA and TBA

As the MBA gene expression data and the TBAs regard two
different species (mouse and human) and consider two largely
different aspects of gene expression (dynamic, tissue- and loca-
tion-speciﬁc expression levels versus a static, condition-indepen-
dent predisposition for binding events), we reasoned that a joint
application of both could be beneﬁcial for the purpose of prior-
itizing candidate genes for hereditary disorders.

For the RIO and the smallest artiﬁcial loci (N :50), for
example, the disease-associated gene g ranked first or second
for 45 gip pairs with the MBA-based and for 42 gip pairs
with the TBA-based approach, respectively, but there was
no overlap at all between these correct predictions (see
Supplementary Table S3). Overall, median Spearman correlation
coefﬁcients of the leave-one-out rankings obtained for MBA and
TBA were close to zero, ranging from 0.031 (for N: 50) to 0.044
(for N 2400). This indicates that successful predictions of the
MBA-based approach are usually not obtained through the
TBA-based approach and Vice versa, providing a strong ratio-
nale for an integration of the two approaches.

Disease-gene discovery

 

Therefore, we integrated the results obtained for the two indi-
vidual prioritizations using an adaptation of the generalized
noisy-OR gate (see Section 2). We found that their complemen-
tarity considerably increases the predictive power with respect to
our previous work (Piro et al., 2010). This becomes clear when
comparing the results for MBA-based predictions with PCC (grey
box in Table lereflecting the same method that we used for
our previous studyiwith those for the new combined approach
(Table 10). Indeed, for the different locus sizes and evaluation
categories, the number of recovered disease genes increased by
up to 226% (for N: 400 and ranking among the top 10).

3.4 Comparison to other prioritization methods

Bornigen et al. (2012) have recently evaluated eight commonly
used candidate gene prioritization methods and obtained realistic
performance estimates for ex novo predictions by applying the
tools to novel genewlisease associations within a few days of
their publication. They obtained areas under the receiver operat-
ing characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.5%.86.

In comparison, for our unbiased LOOCV over the largest
artiﬁcial loci (N 2400), containing the most candidates, we
obtained an AUC of 0.81 (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Only
two of the tools tested by Bornigen et al. (2012), GeneDistiller
(Seelow et al., 2008) and Endeavour (Aerts et al., 2006) obtained
slightly higher AUCs (0.86 and 0.83, respectively). Hence, the
performance of our approach is generally in line with the most
efﬁcient approaches commonly being used.

3.5 Novel predictions for mental retardation

Given the positive outcome of the large-scale LOOCV that simu-
lates the application of our method to OMIM phenotypes of
unknown molecular basis (OMIM symbol: %), we applied the
procedure to the eight partly overlapping orphan loci listed in
Table 2 that are involved in various syndromes (both autosomal
and X-linked) of which MR is an important clinical feature.

4 DISCUSSION

Regulatory information from PWM scans has previously been
used as an additional information source in a number of candidate
gene prioritization methods (Kann, 2010; Piro and Di Cunto,
2012). However, because of the stringent criteria that are often
necessary to decide whether a speciﬁc DNA segment is a binding
site, leading to reduced sensitivity and a likely disregard of pos-
sibly functional low-afﬁnity binding sites (Hannenhalli, 2008), it is
unlikely that information from PWM scans alone would be sui-
table for disease-gene discovery. Likewise, the beneﬁt of more
comprehensive TBA proﬁles is not immediately clear and has
previously not been explored on a large scale.

Although gene function can often be inferred from primary
coding sequences, deciphering functional properties exclusively
from non-coding sequences is much more difﬁcult (Carroll,
2005). For one, co-afﬁnity is static and condition-independent;
hence, it does not directly translate into the co-expression of, say,
two genes in brain tissues. In contrast to gene expression data,
the concept of binding afﬁnity does not implicitly integrate infor-
mation on different types of regulatory control (such as the
methylation state of promoters, nucleosome positioning and

the post-transcriptional downregulation by microRNAs).
Instead, co-afﬁnities, being calculated from promoter sequences
only, are limited to the direct binding of TFs to promoters.

Second, even a successful binding event must not necessarily
alter transcription rates if, for example, required co-factors are
lacking in a speciﬁc tissue. Indeed, Gao et al. (2004) suggest that
as much as 42% of TF binding may be non-functional in yeast.

Finally, binding afﬁnity proﬁles constitute a description of a
cis—regulatory sequence, in this case, the promoter, involved in
the regulatory control of a gene (Molineris et al., 2011). But
given the incompleteness of the TBA proﬁles we considered
(composed of a core set of 130 PWMs; see Section 2) or, more
general, the incompleteness of our knowledge regarding func-
tional TF binding, a successful application of this kind of infor-
mation to disease-gene prediction was not necessarily guaranteed
(for a more detailed discussion, see Supplementary Text S1).

Nonetheless, in this study, we could show that regulatory infor-
mation alone, in the form of TBA-based co-afﬁnities, can indeed
prioritize candidate genes for hereditary disorders. Further
improvements of the predictive power were obtained by the appli-
cation of a new similarity measure, RIO, and by integration with
our previous approach based on 3D gene expression patterns (Piro
et al., 2010). We exploited the new integrated approach to identify
promising candidates for several MR syndromes (Table 2).

Strikingly, among the best candidates for most of the orphan
loci, we found genes that have been reported to be implicated in
one or more other MR-related syndromes (Table 2 and
Supplementary Table S5). Notably, several of these MR genes
obtained high ranks, although they were not included in our
original set of known genewlisease associations (and, hence, in
our set of possible reference genes). For example, synaptophysin
(SYP) is involved in MR, X-linked 96 (OMIM ID #300802)
(Tarpey et al., 2009), whose phenotype entry is brief and does
not contain the term ‘central nervous system’ in its clinical
synopsis. Nonetheless, we found the gene among the top 3%
candidates for the largest orphan locus, cubitus valgus with
MR and unusual facies (OMIM %300471), underlining that
our method is indeed capable to identify promising candidate
genes that are not yet known to be linked to MR. Likewise,
ZMYM3, our top candidate for the Prieto X-linked MR syn-
drome (OMIM %309610), is not associated to any CNS-related
phenotype entry in OMIM, although a chromosomal transloca—
tion (X;13) involving ZMYM3 is associated with X-linked MR
(van der Maarel et al., 1996).

Additionally to known MR genes, some of our top ranking
candidates have already been suggested as possibly being
involved in MR syndromes or have been implicated in, or pro-
posed for, other neurological diseases (including neurodegenera—
tive disorders like Alzheimer’s disease; Table 2 and
Supplementary Table S5).

For space reasons, here, we discuss only the top candidates for
alopecia/MR syndrome 1 (APMRl; %203650), originally des-
cribed by Baraitser et al. (1983).

Genetic syndromes characterized by alopecia (hair loss) and
severe MR are rare disorders of largely unknown molecular
basis. In 2006, by studying a large consanguineous family from
Pakistan, John et al. (2006) mapped the APMRl locus to the 5.4
Mb region on chromosome 3 located between markers D3S1232
and D3S2436. Of the candidates at this locus, they screened for

mutations in coding exons only the transcription factor E TV5 , but
no abnormalities were found (John et al., 2006). Interestingly, we
found E TV5 as the second best candidate. However, although it is
in principle possible that mutations affecting its regulatory regions
may be responsible for the phenotype, this seems unlikely on the
basis of the available functional information. Indeed, ETV5 loss
of function has been shown to affect the maintenance of sperma-
togonial stem cells (Chen et al., 2005) and kidney development (Lu
et al., 2009), whereas ETV5 overexpression has been linked to
ovarian cancer (Llaurado et al., 2012).

The only top 10 candidate that has been linked to an MR-related
disorder is M CCCI, mutations of which are known to be res-
ponsible for 3-methylcrotonyl—CoA carboxylase 1 deficiency
(Baumgartner et al., 2001; Gallardo et al., 2001), which is charac-
terized by multiple clinical features, one of which can be
MR (Murayama et al., 1997; Steen et al., 1999). Alopecia, however,

is generally not a feature of the disease, although a possible associa-
tion has been reported in a single case (Leonard et al., 1981).

However, as a particular strength of the predictive method
that we present here is an extrapolation of functional relation-
ships from reference genes to candidate genes thatirelying on
gene expression and sequence information aloneido not require
any known functional annotation, less obvious candidates could
nonetheless be associated with the disorder.

The first candidate, CLCNZ, encodes a voltage-gated chloride
channel, previously implicated in idiopathic generalized epilepsies
(Haug et al., 2003). DC UN ID] , ranking third, is another interest-
ing candidate because a polymorphism has been identiﬁed as a
risk factor in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (Villa et al.,
2009). Also D VL3, ranking forth, is of particular interest because
the protein it encodes interacts with Shank, which is involved in
several neuronal disorders including MR (Saupe et al., 2011).

Disease-gene discovery

 

A ﬁnal promising candidate may be ADIPOQ (ranking 18th;
Supplementary Table S6), although adiponectin, the protein it
encodes, is thought to be expressed speciﬁcally in adipose tissue
(Hu et al., 1996). Nonetheless, recent research indicates that the
secreted protein inﬂuences the proliferation of adult hippocampal
neural stem/progenitor cells that express adiponectin receptors 1
and 2 (AdipoRl and AdipoR2) (Zhang et al., 2011), and adipo-
nectin deficiency could also negatively impact brain microcircula-
tion (V achharajani et al., 2012). Moreover, a low-protein level and
a mutation of the corresponding gene were found in a patient
affected by Werner syndrome (Hashimoto et al., 2007), which is
characterized, among other features, by prominent hair loss.

We think that these examples show well how the predictions
obtained by our approach could support geneticists to dissect the
molecular basis of many ill-deﬁned human disorders.

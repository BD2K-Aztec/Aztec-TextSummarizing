ABSTRACT

Motivation: Data quality is a critical issue in the analyses of DNA
copy number alterations obtained from microarrays. It is commonly
assumed that copy number alteration data can be modeled as piece-
wise constant and the measurement errors of different probes are
independent. However, these assumptions do not always hold in prac-
tice. In some published datasets, we find that measurement errors are
highly correlated between probes that interrogate nearby genomic
loci, and the piecewise-constant model does not fit the data well.
The correlated errors cause problems in downstream analysis, leading
to a large number of DNA segments falsely identified as having copy
number gains and losses.

Method: We developed a simple tool, called autocorrelation scanning
profile, to assess the dependence of measurement error between
neighboring probes.

Results: Autocorrelation scanning profile can be used to check data
quality and refine the analysis of DNA copy number data, which we
demonstrate in some typical datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA copy number alteration (CNA) is one of the hallmarks
of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011) and has been linked
to various complex genetic diseases (Girirajan et al., 2011;
McCarroll and Altshuler, 2007). Technological advances in
microarrays (Maresso and Broeckel, 2008; Snijders et al., 2001;
Wang et al., 2009; Yau and Holmes, 2008) and next-generation
sequencing (Campbell et al., 2008) have made it possible to gen-
erate large amounts of CNA data (Ahmad and Iqbal, 2012;
Li et al., 2012; Lisovich et al., 2011; Teo et al., 2012). Various
methods developed for CNA data analysis have been compared
in published reviews (Baross et al., 2007; Eckel-Passow et al.,
2011; Grayson and Aune, 2011; Yau and Holmes, 2008). These
methods differ in their focus, including preprocessing and nor-
malization (Lisovich et al., 2011; Stamoulis and Betensky, 2011;
Wang et al., 2012), segmentation (Broet and Richardson, 2006;
Huang et al., 2005; Hupe et al., 2004; Olshen et al., 2004), joint
analysis of multiple samples (Diskin et al., 2006; McCarroll et al.,
2008; Walter et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2009), copy number based on

mapped sequence reads (Chiang et al., 2009; Ivakhno et al., 2010;
Li et al., 2012; Magi et al., 2011, 2012; Sathirapongsasuti et al.,
2011; Xi et al., 2011), integrated analysis with genotyping, allele-
speciﬁc copy number (Li et al., 2008) and others (Abyzov et al.,
2011; Li et al., 2011; Pique-Regi et al., 2010; van de Wiel et al.,
2007; Wang et al., 2007). However, there are still some challen-
ging issues regarding quality assessment and biological interpret-
ation of CNA data (Hanemaaijer et al., 2012; Wineinger and
Tiwari, 2012; Zhang et al., 2011).

A common step of CNA analysis is segmentation, which trans-
forms noisy measurements into genomic segments of equal copy
number. This step aims to reduce noise and data dimension.
Signiﬁcant gains/losses of the segments can be subsequently
recognized. The ends of the segments may correspond to DNA
breakage points. The underlying assumptions in segmentation
are (i) the data can be modeled as piecewise constant, and
(ii) the measurement errors of different probes are independent.
Although in most cases, methods such as circular binary segmen-
tation (CBS; Olshen et al., 2004) yield reasonable results, we find
that occasionally the piecewise-constant model appears to ﬁt the
data poorly and the independence assumption is grossly violated.
The independence assumption is critical because it forms the
basis for separating true signals from noise. Correlated errors
are expected to lead to incorrect identiﬁcation of aberrant
segments.

To address the issue, we have developed a method called the
autocorrelation scanning proﬁle (ASP). Autocorrelation is the
cross-correlation of a signal with itself, which is a mathematical
tool for ﬁnding repeating patterns in time series data. If the time
series data can be modeled as piecewise constant and the noises
in the data are independent at different time points, ASP has the
following appealing properties: (i) the autocorrelation within
each segment of a constant mean is expected to be 0; (ii) at the
junction of an abrupt change-point, however, the autocorrelation
rises signiﬁcantly above 0. We observe different patterns when
the ASP method is applied to published datasets. Our results
show that ASP can be used to check for CNA data quality
and refine the analysis.

2 METHODS

2.1 Autocorrelation scanning proﬁle

ASP assesses the autocorrelation pattern from the copy number proﬁle
(CNP) of a sample. A CNP is a vector, denoted as x[1, . . . ,n], where n is
the number of probed positions in the genome. The components of the
vector are ordered by the chromosome number and the chromosomal

coordinates of the probed positions. The values of the components of the
vector are log-transformed DNA copy numbers. Probes that do not cor-
respond to unique chromosomal positions are excluded. We deﬁne the
ASP as a vector that is computed as follows:

ASP[J] : cor(x[j—g, ...,j+g— l],x[j—v—2V+ l, ...,j+v—2V]),
where j : % + 1, ...,n —%“ and cor stands for Pearson correlation. The
vector x[j — g, . . . ,j + g — 1] represents a scanning window enclosing w
probe signals. In this study, we choose w: 100.

The following procedure is used to evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of
the ASP. (i) To remove the effects of gains/losses, we apply Tukey’s run-
ning median smoothing algorithm (window size: 101) to a CNP, which
results in a smoothed CNP. (ii) We then take the difference between the
raw probe signals and the smoothed CNP to be the residuals, which we
then randomly permute along the genome to compute the ASP. Because
the randomly permuted residuals are supposed to have no signiﬁcant
autocorrelation, the ASP values resulting from the permuted residuals
are assumed to form a null distribution. (iii) We use the top 99 percentile
of the ASP values as the threshold value of signiﬁcance, with P: 0.01.

2.2 Computer simulation

To generate simulated CNP data, we set the dimension of a CNP to be
n: 10000. Let x be a vector of 10000 random numbers following a
standard normal distribution. Here, x is the initial CNP that corresponds
to a sample with no copy number change and ASP is ~0. To generate a
CNP that has ASP>0, we use the following coupling function:

V(x)=x*(1—ﬁ)+(y+z)*§.

where y : (x[2],x[3], . . . ,x[n], x[l]),z : (x[n], x[l], . . . ,x[n — 2],x[n — 1])
and ,8 is an adjustable parameter. We then normalize the CNP so that its
mean is 0 and standard deviation (sd) is 1. We then introduce a gain
region and a loss region on V(x), each with 2000 probe sites. The amp-
litudes of the gain and the loss are equal to 1. By tuning beta, we obtain
V(x) with different levels of the median ASP. We then apply the CBS
algorithm to identify the segments. A segment is called a signiﬁcant gain/
loss if the following:

m*¢N>3,

where m is the segmental mean and J N is the square root of the number
of probes in the segment. False positives (FPS) are deﬁned as sites that are
called signiﬁcant gains/losses, but for which the nominal value is 0. False
negatives (FNs) are deﬁned as sites that are not called as signiﬁcant gains/
losses, but for which the nominal is not 0. True positives (TPs) are deﬁned
as gains/losses that are correctly identiﬁed. True negatives (TNs) are
deﬁned as sites that are not called as significant gains/losses, and for
which the nominal is 0.

The computer program we use in this study can be found in the
Supplementary Materials.

3 RESULTS

To evaluate the use of the ASP method, we compute the ASPs
using previously published DNA copy number data. Figure 1
shows the typical patterns we observe. The most common pat-
tern is shown in Figure 1A. After denoising, the CNP (the green
curve) has the shape of step functions with well-deﬁned abrupt
change-points. The ASP proﬁle (Fig. 1A, bottom) peaks around
the abrupt change-points of CNP but mostly ﬂuctuates near 0 in
other loci, and rarely exceeds the signiﬁcance line (the horizontal
black line). It appears that the piecewise-constant model ﬁts the
CNP data well and there is little correlation between the

measurements of different probes, i.e. the probes can be regarded
as independent in this case.

However, the pattern shown in Figure 1A is not universal,
as other patterns have also been observed. For example, in
Figure 1B, the ASP appears to be much higher, exceeding the
signiﬁcance line (the horizontal black line around 0.2) through-
out the genome. We also ﬁnd samples lacking clearly deﬁned
change-points (Fig. 1C). The CNP appears to have gradual
changes in some areas, such as in chromosome 1 (Fig. 1C,
top). Another distinct pattern is shown in Figure 1D, in which
the ASP reaches high levels in a localized region in the genome
(chromosome 12). The CNP also ﬂuctuates a lot in the same
region.

We suspect the pattern seen in Figure 1B may indicate a qual-
ity problem with the DNA sample. We obtained supporting
evidence of this View from comparing formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-
embedded (FFPE) samples with fresh-frozen samples obtained
from the same type of cancer and using the same microarray
platform. Formalin ﬁxation is known to cause damages in
DNA, and extraction of DNA from FFPE samples is more
prone to biases (Brosens et al., 2010). As expected, we ﬁnd
that the FFPE samples appear to have elevated ASPs (Fig. 2)
more often than the fresh-frozen samples. The average of the
median ASP of each FFPE sample is 0.32, whereas the median
ASP of the fresh-frozen samples is only 0.13. The difference
between the two groups of samples is statistically signiﬁcant
(P: 7.56e-10, Student t—test).

To better understand the consequences of elevated ASPs, we
performed computer simulations to create artiﬁcial CNPs with
different levels of autocorrelation. We ﬁrst generated CNPs fol-
lowing a standard normal distribution, which corresponds to a
sample with no copy number change and ASP approximately
equal to 0. We then introduced correlation between neighboring
probes by coupling the signals between neighboring probes with
a tunable parameter (see details in Methods). Figure 3 shows
how the CBS segmentation results depend on median ASPs
that are computed from the simulated CNPs. The results show
that when the median ASP is <0.1, the number of segments
remains at 1 and the FP rate is close to 0. The number of seg-
ments and the FP rate rise rapidly when the median ASP is >0.4.
This result suggests that there is a clear association between the
elevated ASP and the number of segments. A similar relationship
has been found in real data. Figure 4 shows correlation between
the median ASP and number of segments in a dataset of
971 breast cancer samples (Spearman’s rank correlation
coefﬁcient: 0.74).

Besides correlated measurement errors between adjacent
probes, segmental copy number changes can affect ASP. To
assess the effects of the former factor alone, we used a dataset
of 270 samples from a population without cancer and with few
copy number changes. We used that dataset as a standard refer-
ence set for calibrating the data on the platform. To further
reduce the effects of the copy number changes, we removed the
segments that had signiﬁcant gains and losses. Because the nom-
inal copy number is 2 nearly throughout the genome, the correl-
ations observed between neighboring probes thus should
measure the extent to which the probes depend on each other.
We calculated the copy number correlation between neighboring
probes. Figure 5 shows the distribution of the correlations (red

range is much wider than that expected from randomly permuted
data. The sd of the red line is 0.16, whereas the sd of the black
line 0.06. This means that we cannot assume that the probes
are independent from each other, even though the correlation
between neighboring probes is near 0 on average.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we have demonstrated the use of ASP in DNA
copy number analysis. The issue of interdependence of probes
has been largely ignored in the existing methods. We argue this is
an important issue and show that there are elevated ASPs that
can be frequently observed in published datasets. Elevated ASPs
mean that one cannot assume that the microarray probes meas-
ure the copy number data independently. The elevated ASPs
inﬂate the FPs in the identiﬁcation of aberrant segments because
they increase the probability of multiple probes having common
biases. From the results of our computer simulations, we found
that FPs in segmentation rise rapidly when the median

Spurious results of copy number changes have been found
experimentally. Mc Sherry et a]. (2007) reported a dramatic
increase in the absolute number of genetic alterations in all
FFPE tissues relative to their matched fresh-frozen counterparts,
suggesting that FFPE samples are more prone to produce spuri-
ous results of copy number changes. These results are similar to

domly permuted residuals

our current study, which showed that FFPE samples tend to
have higher median ASPs than fresh-frozen samples (Fig. 2).

Our ASP method provides a much needed tool for quality
control. Existing tools such as the NanoDrop spectrophotometer
aim to ensure that DNA samples to be hybridized onto the
arrays are in sufﬁcient quantity and have the appropriate
length. There are also metrics commonly used to assess data
quality, such as the derivative log-ratio spread (DLRS; Largo
et al., 2007) and genotyping call rate on SNP arrays. The
DLRS estimates the log-ratio noise by calculating the spread
of log-ratio differences between consecutive probes along all
chromosomes. The genotyping call rate of a sample is the frac-
tion of probes that have passed the detection filter. The DLRS
and genotype call rate are correlated, both reﬂecting measure-
ment noises on individual probes. ASP is conceptually different,
as it measures the correlation of noises between neighboring
probes. Hence, we recommend the use of ASP in addition to
existing quality measures.

It is interesting to note that the ASPs show several distinct
patterns (Fig. 1). When only a localized region has a high ASP
(Fig. 1D), the phenomenon is similar to that reported as chromo-
thripsis aVIaher and Wilson, 2012) or ﬁrestorm (Hicks et al.,
2006). The CNP pattern seen in Figure 1C contains gradual
changes, which poorly ﬁt the piecewise-constant model. The piece-
wise-constant model is expected to hold under the condition that
there is only one tumor clone in the tissue and the number of aber-
rant segments is less than the number of probe sites. The latter
condition usually holds except in the case of chromothripsis.
When there is only one tumor clone, the denoised copy number
should take integer values after adjusting the scale. The gradual
changes that fall between the level of single copy gain or loss (such
as in Fig. 1C) cannot result from a single tumor clone, and

therefore must come from the contribution of multiple clones.
Tumor tissues containing multiple clones are commonly observed,
which is recognized as another hallmark of cancer (Hanahan and
Weinberg, 2011). Taken together, our results show that ASP pro-
vides a useful tool in DNA copy number analysis.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Functional relationship networks, which summarize the
probability of co-functionality between any two genes in the
genome, could complement the reductionist focus of modern biology
for understanding diverse biological processes in an organism. One
major limitation of the current networks is that they are static, while
one might expect functional relationships to consistently reprogram
during the differentiation of a cell lineage. To address this potential
limitation, we developed a novel algorithm that leverages both differ-
entiation stage-specific expression data and large-scale heteroge-
neous functional genomic data to model such dynamic changes. We
then applied this algorithm to the time-course RNA-Seq data we col-
lected for ex vivo human erythroid cell differentiation.

Results: Through computational cross-validation and literature
validation, we show that the resulting networks correctly predict the
(de)-activated functional connections between genes during erythro-
poiesis. We identified known critical genes, such as HBD and GATA1,
and functional connections during erythropoiesis using these dynamic
networks, while the traditional static network was not able to provide
such information. Furthermore, by comparing the static and the dy-
namic networks, we identified novel genes (such as OSBP2 and
PDZK1|P1) that are potential drivers of erythroid cell differentiation.
This novel method of modeling dynamic networks is applicable to
other differentiation processes where time-course genome-scale ex-
pression data are available, and should assist in generating greater
understanding of the functional dynamics at play across the genome
during development.

1 INTRODUCTION

Functional relationship networks offer a potentially critical com-
plement to the reductionist focus of modern biology and to our

ability to understand and interpret diverse biological processes
systematically in an organism. These networks are modeled
through integrating heterogeneous large-scale genomic data
(Chikina et al., 2009; Guan et al., 2008, 2010, 1012;
Huttenhower et al., 2006; Inouye et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2004,
2008, 2011; Park et al., 2013; Pena-Castillo et al., 2008; Pop et al.,
2010; Singh-Blom et al., 2013) and they represent the probability
of co-functionality between any two genes in the genome. Mining
these networks can help us discover gene functions and identify
disease/phenotype-associated genes. We have previously mod-
eled the global functional relationship network for the mouse
(Guan et al., 2008, 2010) and developed the algorithm that can
systematically model tissue-speciﬁc networks in mammalian sys-
tems (Guan et al., 2012).

Current network models, including the ones we previously es-
tablished, have one major limitation: a single network is gener-
ated without considering the dynamic changes of functional
connections, which might be expected to change during the dif-
ferentiation of any given cell lineage. It should be anticipated
that functional connections might consistently evolve, which
would allow different cell fates to arise from the same genetic
background. It has been widely accepted and modeled that at the
co-expression, physical interaction and pathway levels, inter-
actions between genes are constantly changing
(Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2012; Park et al.,
2003). Motivated by our recently developed method to infer dy-
namic signaling network responses (Zhu and Guan, 2014) and to
classify cell lineage-speciﬁc expression patterns (Bethunaickan
et al., 2014), we extend our algorithm to integrate heterogeneous
datasets for predicting the dynamic co-functionality relationships
across a differentiation process.

To capture such dynamics in functional connections, here, we
introduce the concept of ‘transitional’ functional relationship
networks, which are intended to reveal the activated and deacti-
vated functional relationships between any two stages distin-
guishable during cell lineage differentiation. The assumption
behind this algorithm is that an existing connection in the sta-
tionary network is likely to be activated, if both members of a
pair of genes become upregulated, and Vice versa. However,
unlike most of the existing methods that directly map upregu-
lated/downregulated genes to the stationary network (Faith
et al., 2007; Langfelder and Horvath, 2008), we reweigh diverse
genomic datasets for their relevance to the (de)-activated

functional relationships to model such transitional networks for
the particular differentiation process under investigation.

Compared with co-expression network approaches such as
context likelihood of relatedness (CLR; Faith et al., 2007) and
weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA; Langfelder
and Horvath, 2008), this algorithm has the following benefits:
(i) It requires only two stage-speciﬁc samples, while CLR and
WGCNA need a large number of samples. (ii) This algorithm
does not use stage-speciﬁc dataset to directly calculate co-expres-
sion level but to adjust the integration, so its performance is
robust to measurement noise in the stage-speciﬁc expression
data.

We applied this new algorithm to the human erythroid cell
differentiation process to establish transitional networks. We col-
lected RNA-seq data at 4, 8, 11 and 14 days after initial induc-
tion of erythroid cell differentiation from puriﬁed human
CD34+ bone marrow progenitor cells to model the (de)-acti-
vated networks between any two time points. We found that
these networks correctly identify erythroid-speciﬁc genes as
well as erythropoiesis-related connections, which are not revealed
in a static network. Most importantly, we identiﬁed novel can-
didates driving the erythroid cell differentiation process, such as
OSBP2 and PDZKlIPl. We expect that this methodology can be
applied to model dynamic functional relationship networks for
other differentiation processes as well. This network algorithm is
publicly available at: http://guanlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/

2 METHODS

Our method of constructing ‘transitional’ networks can be summarized
diagrammatically in three steps (Fig. 1): (i) establish a ‘gold standard’
describing functionally related gene pairs that become (de)activated be-
tween two time points using existing functional annotation databases and
differentiation process-speciﬁc expression data; (ii) collect heterogeneous
genomic datasets (~1000 in total) from public databases (Alfarano et al.,
2005; Edgar et al., 2002; Ceol et al., 2010; Giildener et al., 2006; Kerrien
et al., 2012; Ozier et al., 2003; Stark et al., 2011), including expression
proﬁles, physical and genetic interactions (see complete data description
in Supplementary Information S1), and (iii) weigh and integrate them
using the transitional stage-speciﬁc ‘gold standard’ pairs, and therefore
generate networks that cover all genes. Relevant content is available in
subsequent sections.

2.1 Genomic data acquisition and pre-processing

We collected heterogeneous functional genomic data as the training data
for the Bayesian integration step. All data were converted into pair-wise
similarity scores S ( i, j ), which corresponds to the level of similarity be-
tween genes i and j within a dataset.

2.1.] Expression data We acquired 1021 human microarray datasets
from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; Edgar et al., 2002; all of the
datasets have no less than three samples) as of March 8, 2013. A list of
datasets used in this project can be found in the Supplementary
Information S1. For each dataset, Pearson product-moment correlation
coefﬁcient, p, is calculated to evaluate the level of co-expression between
every gene pair. The p values were transformed into z-scores using Fisher

Fig. 1. Strategy for constructing transitional networks. First, global gold standard pairs are generated from GO, KEGG and BioCyc databases. Then,
we collected time-course RNA-seq data from erythroid cell differentiation to identify the upregulated and downregulated genes between any two time
points. These gene lists were then used to restrict the global gold standard for the activated/deactivated networks. Around 1000 public genomic datasets
such as expression and proteiniprotein physical and genetic interactions were differentially weighed using the global gold standard and the stage-speciﬁc
gold standards, respectively, and then integrated through Bayesian networks to generate the global, static network and the transitional networks. Finally,
we computationally compared the performance of transitional networks with the traditional static network and validated genes critical to erythroid

differentiation

transformation and then shifted to ~N(0, 1). This normalization is used
to minimize the difference among different datasets and platforms. Pairs
that lack information in the dataset under investigation were considered
missing. Furthermore, between datasets, mutual information was calcu-
lated to reduce the contribution of similar datasets (as described in the
next section), which could signiﬁcantly ameliorate the negative effects of
repetitive datasets that often occur in public databases (Huttenhower
et al, 2006, 2009).

2.1.2 Interaction data A total of 28713 pairs were retrieved
from BioGRID (Stark et al., 2011), BIND (Alfarano et al., 2005),
DIP (Ozier et al., 2003), IntAct (Kerrien et al., 2012), MINT
(Ceol et al, 2010) and MIPS (Giildener et al., 2006) as of April 24,
2013. An interacting pair is assigned with a value of 1. Pairs that
do not appear in the interaction datasets are assigned with a value of
0. Protein domain data were not included in the analysis because of
its direct overlap with the gold standard retrieved from Gene
Ontology (G0).

2.2 Gold standard functionally related pairs

2.2.] Global, static gold standard Following the tradition in this
ﬁeld (Guan et al., 2008, 2012; Huttenhower et al., 2006), for the global
static network, positive gold standard gene pairs are obtained from sev-
eral biological datasets: GO (Ashburner et al., 2000) terms, BioCyc (Karp
et al., 2005) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG;
Kanehisa et al., 2004) pathways. A gene pair where both genes are anno-
tated to the same speciﬁc biological process (GO), or having a direct
interaction in BioCyc or KEGG, is considered as a positive pair. GO
terms or pathways with >300 annotated genes are excluded to avoid
broad biological processes or pathways. As the target of the transitional
networks is functional relationships instead of physical interactions, pro-
teiniprotein interaction data were used as a feature dataset instead of
gold standard. A total of 674098 positive gold standard gene pairs were
obtained. Because there is no existing database that deﬁnes functional
unrelated genes, the negative gold standard was approximated with ran-
domly selected pairs. Based on a prior that ~5% of gene pairs are func-
tionally related, which is a ratio used in many previous studies (Guan
et al., 2008, 2012; Huttenhower et al., 2006), we randomly generate
~1.2 x 107 negative gold standard pairs.

2.2.2 S tage-specific RNA-Seq for human erythroid cell
diﬂ’erentiation We included purified human CD34-l- hematopoietic
progenitor cells to differentiate ex vivo under conditions that were previ-
ously reported to achieve 1000-fold cell proliferation and nearly syn-
chronous erythroid differentiation (Giarratana et al., 2004; Shi et al.,
2013, 2014a and b). This dataset covers four time points, Day 4, 8, 11
and 14, with two biological replicates each. Detailed RNA-Seq protocol
could be found in Supplementary Files. The data have been deposited in
the NCBI GEO [accession number GSE54602].

2.2.3 Preprocessing RNA-Seq data to identify significantly chan-
ged genes between stages NCBI build 37 .2 transcript annotation ﬁle
was used as the reference genome, and BOWTIE2 indexes were created
by bowtie2—build. RNA-Seq data were mapped to NCBI build 37.2 tran-
script annotation ﬁles, using TopHat v2.0.10 and Cufﬂinks v2.1.1.

After mapping, replicates at the same time point were combined using
their average Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped
reads (FPKM) values.

We deﬁne a signiﬁcantly changed gene by two criteria: (i) its absolute
FPKM value change is >0.1 and (ii) its FPKM fold change is >2.0. We
have tested the robustness of this algorithm to the variation of these two
cutoffs (see Supplementary Table S1 for the number of differentially
regulated genes). We have evaluate the robustness of our method by
testing different cutoff, or existing tool (DESeq Anders and Huber

(2010)), when determining the signiﬁcantly changed genes. A similar per-
formance has been observed (Supplementary Figs S6 and S7).

2.2.4 Gold standard for transitional networks A gold standard pair
for the activated network at a particular transitional stage must satisfy
two criteria: (i) They must be functionally related in the global sense;
(ii) both genes in this pair must be signiﬁcantly upregulated.
Supplementary Table S2 lists the number of positive pairs generated
for each network using these two criteria. It shows that, as expected,
when erythroid cell differentiation proceeds, the number of signiﬁcantly
differently expressed genes between adjacent stages drops. Based on this
table, the ﬁrst stage, Day 4 to 8, during which the cells were committed to
the erythropoiesis fate, contains the strongest signals of differentiation.
Similarly, we generated the gold standard positives for the deactivated
networks between each pair of stages, requiring that the functionally
related pairs must be downregulated together. Owing to the insufﬁcient
number of gold standard pairs for Day 8 to Day 11 activation, Day 11 to
Day 14 activation and deactivation networks, they are excluded from
analysis.

Note that, the positive global gold standard represents only the existing
human knowledge, which is not complete. Thus, the intersection of gold
standard and the upregulated genes is not complete to represent all im-
portant functional relationships in erythropoiesis. Bringing the 1021 gen-
omic datasets, which cover the majority of the genes, allows us to infer a
probability, even for the genes which no function has been assigned to in
the GO/BioCyc/KEGG databases.

2.3 Bayesian integration

The algorithm used to generate the static and transitional networks is
based on Bayesian networks regularized with mutual information. Using
this method, different datasets are weighted differently by how well they
recover the gold standard pairs. Speciﬁcally, the posterior probability of a
functional relationship is calculated by integrating all available evidence
(Guan et al, 2008, 2012; Huttenhower et al, 2009)

where FR = 1 represents a pair of genes are functionally related globally
or at a speciﬁc stage, according to the target network, n is the number of
datasets, Eff". stands for the score for this gene pair in dataset k and Z is a
normalization factor (more details regarding caculation of the posterior
Eff]. can be found in Supplementary Files). Prior is arbitrarily assigned
with a value of 0.05 as the convention in the functional relationship net-
work ﬁeld (Guan et al., 2008, 2012; Huttenhower et al., 2009). Intuitively,
for genes i, j, the probability P(FR,-J- = llEij, E3],  , E21.)
(=P(FRJ-,,- = HE}, 1, E3], > > > , 1.)) denotes how likely, given existing data-
sets and their accuracy and relevance to the stage under investigation,
they participate in the same biological process.

Conditional dependence between input datasets is a major factor af-
fecting the performance of naive Bayesian integration (Guan et al, 2008,
2012; Huttenhower et al., 2009; Pop et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2012) be-
cause Equation 1 is valid if and only if all the evidences are conditionally
independent. Giving that many biological datasets share information,
multiple strategies were used to minimize the effects of information over-
lap. For physical interactions, as many datasets do not have enough
examples to learn a trustable posterior, we combined different data
sources into one and removed the duplicate entries in the combined
dataset. For gene expression data, which are the major sources of the
overlapping information, we calculated or, which represents the ratio of
the sum of mutual information between one dataset and all other datasets
to the entropy of this dataset.

dataset k contains highly redundant information with others, P’(Ef.‘J|FR,-J

probability.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Top upweighted datasets for activated network
between Day 4 and Day 8

We used Bayesian integration regularized with mutual informa-
tion to weigh and integrate the genomic data together to model
these ‘transitional’ networks. Bayesian framework has been used
extensively for integrating heterogeneous genomic datasets that
differ in nature (Chikina et al., 2009; Guan et al., 2008, 2010,
2012; Huttenhower et al., 2009; Pop et al., 2010; Wong et al.,
2012). In the present context, the Bayesian integration can auto-
matically leverage the implicit relationships between datasets and
a developmental stage and consequently generate accurate stage-
speciﬁc networks even from feature data that are not speciﬁcally
designed for a particular stage of interest. As shown in Table 1,
datasets that are relevant to erythroid cell differentiation were
automatically assigned greater posterior in our transitional net-
work integration, when compared with the static network inte-
gration. The most upweighted dataset for the Day 4 to Day 8
activated network, GDS2431 (Keller et al., 2007), directly
measured adult CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell

differentiation. Other top-weighted datasets, GDS3044,
GDS304, GDSIOS9, GDSl310 and GDS841, were obtained
from cord blood cells, leukemia cells or peripheral blood cells.
They are likely to indirectly reﬂect the erythroid cell differenti-
ation process. Furthermore, the reliability of each dataset is also
automatically taken into consideration using the Bayesian net-
work classiﬁer trained on the gold standard from GO
(Ashburner et al., 2000), BioCyc (Karp et al., 2005) and
KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2004) analysis. Therefore, a dataset
that is both highly relevant to the target stage and of high quality
will be given greater weight. Using this method, we generated
networks representing the activated and deactivated functional
relationships between Days 4/8, 8/11, 4/11 and 4/ 14 during eryth-
roid cell differentiation (networks for activated Day 8 to Day 11
and Day 11 to Day 14 were excluded because of the small
number of differentially regulated genes).

3.2 Cross-validation shows that the transitional networks
are accurate for predicting stage-speciﬁc activated
and deactivated functional relationships

We performed cross-validation to computationally evaluate the
ability of the transitional networks to identify activated and
deactivated functional relationships between two differentiation
stages. That is, for each transitional network, only part of the
gold standard is used to establish the model, while the rest part of
gold standard, which can not be seen during the model training,
is used to validate the prediction. Our assumption was that when
we examine the genes that are upregulated and co-functional as
the test set, the model for the activated network should perform
better than the models for static networks. To prevent contam-
ination in cross-validation, the gold standard was split into two
disjoint graphs, with one serving as the training set and the other
as the test set. A static network Guan et al. (2008), which repre-
sents the global functional relationship network generated

Fig. 2. Transitional networks are more accurate than the static network
in capturing the dynamic functional connections between erythroid cell
differentiation stages. This ﬁgure shows the cross-validation performance
of the models for activated, deactivated and static networks for Day 4 to
Day 8, evaluated against the upregulated gold standard (a and c) or
downregulated gold standard (b and d). The evaluation results indicate
that the models for the transitional networks performed better than the
static network in predicting their respective activated and deactivated
functional connections

without cell lineage speciﬁcity information, has been used for
comparison.

We found that improvement is consistently recorded by these
transitional networks compared with the static network (Fig. 2
and Table 2). For example, the Day 4/ 8 activated network had
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)
of 0.739, whereas the static network had an AUC of 0.650 using
the same test set, which is a 59% improvement in AUC over the
random baseline (0.5). Such improvement is consistent across the
entire precision-recall spectrum (Fig. 2c41). Similarly, compared
with the static network, the Day 4/ 8 network had an AUC im-
proved from 0.628 (static) to 0.719 (transitional), thus represent-
ing a 71% improvement in AUC. Such improvement was
observed for all activated and deactivated networks across all
pairs of stages.

On average, the AUC of the static network evaluated
against the activated/deactivated gold standards is 0.666 and
the Area Under Precision Recall Curve (AUPRC) is 0.077,
while the transitional networks achieved an average AUC of
0.721 (:l:0.034, median value = 0.719) and AUPRC of 0.121
(:l:0.037, median value = 0.112; Table 2). Evaluation results of
receiver operating characteristic curves and precision recall
curves are available in Supplementary Figures $1784. The con-
sistent improvement by application of the transitional network
algorithms demonstrates the robust performance of this algo-
rithm and implies that these networks can correctly reveal
the dynamic functional connections during erythroid cell
differentiation.

Because progenitor cells are fully committed to the erythroid
fate between days 4/8, during which the majority of the network
rewiring occurs, the following discussion focuses on the networks
generated at this transitional stage.

3.3 Validation of the transitional network using critical
gene pairs and genes during erythropoiesis

These new transitional networks are able to identify functional
relationships that are activated at speciﬁc stages. Our experience
on well-studied gene pairs is valuable to assess the quality of the
networks. To identify the erythoid—speciﬁc gene from the transi-
tional networks, we ﬁrst acquired a gene list of genes with spe-
ciﬁc and essential roles in erythrocyte physiology [100 genes from
Hembase Goh et al. (2004) and 10 well-known erythroid-related
transcriptional factor, the full gene list is available in
Supplementary Information S3]. Then for every gene in the
genome, the average connection strength between this gene and
110 of the known erythroid-related genes is calculated, for the
global network and Day 4 to Day 8 activation network, respect-
ively. Genes with larger connection strengths in activation net-
work than global network are considered as erythroid-specific
genes. The top 100 signiﬁcantly changed (erythroid-speciﬁc)
genes are listed in Supplementary Information S2. All biological
examples and novel genes are mentioned below are selected from
the list. Genes in Table 3, for example, are well-studied eryth-
roid-speciﬁc genes and are expected to function together as
erythroid cells differentiate. Hemoglobin beta (HBB; Fig. 3a
and b) has co-function probabilities of only 0.141 and 0.121
with Hemoglobin alpha 1 and 2 (HBA1 and HBA2) in the
static network. These probabilities increased to 0.618 and
0.974, respectively, in the Day 4 to Day 8 activated network
(Table 3 and Fig. 3b). This astonishing disparity between the
two models implies that the activated relationships like HBA27
HBB, which are not apparent in the static network, can be read-
ily identiﬁed in the transitional networks with high confidence.
Table 3 lists some other functional connections between import-
ant genes that directly participate in erythroid cell differentiation,
in both the static and the Day 4 to Day 8 activated networks.
The local topology of the transitional stage-specific network is
informative for identifying individual genes that are important
for erythropoiesis. Figure 3c and d shows an example when using
this network to query gene HBD. In the global static network,
HBD has only seven neighbors with 30.2 connections and the

Fig. 3. Local Networks of HBB, HBD, GATA1, ANKl, IL2RA and FLT3 reveal functional connections that are critical to erythroid differentiation.
Compared with the static network (a, c, e and g), the local activated networks for HBB (b), HBD (d), GATAl (f) and ANKl (h) are much more densely
connected and enriched for genes that are critical to the erythroid cell differentiation process. IL2RA and FLT3 are highly connected to many down-
regulated genes in the deactivated network (i—l), implying that their biological functions are shut down during erythroid cell differentiation

probabilities of most of its functional relationships are <0.2. This
result indicates that the overall connectivity level of HBD is low
in the static sense (Fig. 3c). In the Day 4 to Day 8 activated
network, 13 genes had connection probabilities of >0.8 with
HBD (Fig. 3d). This strong connectivity implies that HBD is a
stage-speciﬁc gene that is intimately associated with erythroid
differentiation. Additionally, this local network of HBD is sig-
niﬁcantly enriched for erythrocyte differentiation-related
processes (GO:0043249, GO:0030218, GO:0034101 and
GO:0048821; Table 4), while no enrichment was found in the
static network for this gene. These observations strongly support

the effectiveness of the stage-speciﬁc networks in identifying
genes that are central to erythroid differentiation and the accur-
acy of those networks. To intuitively show how much edges
differ between the transitional networks and the static net-
work, we implemented a web-based interface to Visualize
the prediction results at http://guanlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/

Inspired by the transitional network for HBD, we further
examined several well-known erythroid-speciﬁc genes by com-
paring the Day 4 to Day 8 activated network with the static
network. For example, erythroid master regulator GATAI

[reviewed in (Cantor and Orkin, 2002; Crispino, 2005; Ferreira
et al., 2005)] plays essential roles in erythroid lineage commit-
ment (Kitajima et al., 2006) and in erythroid terminal maturation
(Pevny et al., 1991). In the present analysis, we observed that the
static network of GATA1 is not enriched for any biological pro-
cess speciﬁc to erythropoiesis, while in the transitional network,
GATAl is closely connected with other well-known erythroid
genes such as GYPB, ANK1 and ALAS2 (Fig. 3e and f).
Thus, the transitional network faithfully reflects the physio-
logical roles of GATA1 in erythroid cells. Among them, one
close neighbor of GATA1 was KLF1, with a connection strength
of 0.76. KLF1’s expression is restricted to erythroid cells, and it
is directly involved in multiple steps during erythroid differenti-
ation (Tallack et al., 2010), including activating ﬂ-globin tran-
scription (Dang et al., 2000) as well as maintaining the
membrane stability of erythroid cells and globin homeostasis
(Funnell et al., 2007). Again, the function of KLF1 is successfully
predicted by the transitional network. In the transitional acti-
vated network, KLF1 is connected to genes that are enriched
for myeloid/erythroid differentiation (P = 002/001, respect-
ively), with an average connectivity strength (of the top 25 neigh-
bors) of 0.74, compared with 0.09 in the static network. Another
example is ANK1 (Fig. 3g and h), an erythroid membrane an-
choring protein, which links spectrin tetramers to the transmem—
brane protein band 3 and RhAG to link the membrane and the
erythroid cytoskeleton (Bennett, 1978; Huang et al., 2013;
Nicolas et al., 2003), and comprises the key determinant that
maintains the membrane elasticity of red blood cells. Here, the
functional connection between ANK1 and spectrin (SPTAl) in
the activated network was 0.84, while their connection is much
weaker in the static network (0.002), indicating that this activated
network algorithm correctly predicts erythroid-speciﬁc func-
tional relationships.

In addition to evaluating the transitional networks that verify
well-established erythroid genes, we also investigated the genes
whose connectivity strengths changed most in the transitional
networks (both activated and deactivated networks) over the
global, static network. For example, interleukin 2 receptor
alpha (IL2RA, Fig. 3i and j) showed a difference of connectivity

strength (of the top 25 neighbors) of ~0.93 between the Day 4 to
Day 8 deactivated network and the static network. The most
closely related neighbors of IL2RA were enriched for T-cell ac-
tivation (P = 3.9 x 10’”) and immune system process
(P = 2.9 x 10’”), suggesting that genes involved in non-eryth-
roid lineage differentiation become repressed during erythroid
differentiation. FLT3 (fms-related tyrosine kinase 3) is another
signiﬁcantly altered gene predicted by the deactivated network
compared with the static network (Fig. 3k and 1). Previous stu-
dies reported that this gene is expressed exclusively in the
CD34+ early progenitor cells and that mutations in this gene
were related to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), B-precursor
cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), T-cell ALL and
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in lymphoid blast crisis
(Drexler et al., 1996; Rosnet et al., 1996). From Day 4 to Day 8,
during which time differentiating CD34+ cells become fully
committed to the erythroid lineage, the transcription of FLT3
is silenced (FPKM expression level reduced from 3.6 to 0.3).
Predictably from this transitional deactivated network algorithm,
loss of FLT3 expression was strongly correlated with other
downregulated genes, many of which are involved in leukocyte
activation and lymphocyte activation-related processes.

3.4 Transitional networks predict novel candidate genes
important for erythroid differentiation

Novel genes predicted by this new stage-speciﬁc transitional net-
work model that execute previously unknown erythroid-speciﬁc
functions, by deﬁnition, potentially are more important and
interesting. Genes, whose co-function probabilities with other
genes changed dramatically between static network and transi-
tional network, are extremely likely to be erythroid-speciﬁc genes
(see Supplementary Information S2 for top 100 changed genes).
One such candidate is oxysterol binding protein 2 (OSBP2),
which is involved in lipid and glucose metabolism (Hynynen
et al., 2009) and cancer cell proliferation and survival [reviewed
in (W eber-Boyvat et al., 2013)], including CML (Henriques Silva
et al., 2003). In CML, OSBP2 maintains the undifferentiated
state of the CML blast cells (Henriques Silva et al., 2003).
Additionally, OSBP2 is associated with hematopoietic stem cell
long-term proliferation and self-renewal as one of the immediate

Fig. 4. Transitional networks predict novel candidates genes driving
erythropoiesis. This ﬁgure shows the local networks of OSBP2 and
PDZKIIPI. The same color legend as Figure 3 applies here. OSBP2
and PDZKIIPI are novel candidates for the erythropoiesis, suggested
by their local connections to many known genes involved in this process
(aid)

targets of STATS (Fatrai et al., 2011). However, the roles that
OSBP2 might play in normal erythropoiesis are still largely un-
known. From the Day 4 to Day 8 activated network analysis
(Fig. 4b), we predict that OSBP2 might play important roles
during erythropoiesis, resulting from its strong connection with
TAL1, GATA1, GYPB, AHSP and other erythroid-specific
genes.

Another interesting candidate emerging from this analysis is
PDZKIIPl (PDZK interacting protein 1), which plays essential
roles during megakaryocyte differentiation (Tothova et al., 2007)
as well as primitive/deﬁnitive erythroid differentiation (Tijssen
et al., 2011). However, it remains unclear how PDZKIIPl
might differentially regulate stage-speciﬁc erythroid differenti-
ation. We discovered that PDZKIIPl was upregulated by >21-
fold from Day 4 to Day 8 and that it is actively involved in this
differentiation process based on this transitional network
(Fig. 4d), suggesting that PDZKIIPl might have unknown func-
tions during erythroid lineage commitment. Although we failed
to detect a strong network connection between PDZKIIPl and
TAL1, we note that PDZKIIPl is located immediately 3’ to
TAL1. Additionally, an erythroid enhancer, which regulates
TAL1 expression, is embedded 3’ to PDZKIIPl and conserved
throughout vertebrate evolution (Delabesse et al., 2005). Because
PDZKIIPl shares transcriptional enhancer elements with TAL1,
a co-regulation between PDZKIIPl and TAL1 was observed in
the dorsal aorta (AGM region) and in the fetal liver of mice, as
well as during embryonic stem cell differentiation (Tijssen et al.,
2011). In the present study, PDZKIIPl andTALl are

coordinately induced (co-regulated) during erythroid differenti-
ation, but they formed completely distinct functional networks,
suggesting that PDZKIIPl might play roles that are unrelated to
TAL1 during the Day 4 to Day 8 erythroid differentiation tran-
sition. These results suggest that transitional networks are able
to successfully predict the functional relationships among genes
and would serve as a valuable tool for future analysis of
erythropoiesis.

4 CONCLUSION

Systematics in developmental biology is an exciting emerging
field, which uses large-scale genomic data to understand the com-
plexity of developmental processes. In this study, we developed a
new algorithm that models the dynamic functional relationships
during a differentiation process through large-scale data integra-
tion. Such networks describe the dependency of functional rela-
tionships between two time points. This novel model for
transitional networks, is an advance over our previous global
(Guan et al., 2008), context-speciﬁc (Guan et al., 2010) and
tissue-speciﬁc networks (Guan et al., 2012), as well as other pre-
viously established functional networks (Chikina et al., 2009; Lee
et al., 2011; Pop et al., 2010), all of which are static in nature.
These transitional networks reveal functional relationships and
genes important to erythroid cell differentiation and function,
which are not shown in the static networks.

Through the application of Bayesian integration, the approach
described here managed to combine diverse genomic datasets,
while datasets related to the target stage were assigned stronger
weights. The key element determining Bayesian classiﬁer, the
gold standard pairs, is reﬁned to a group of gene pairs that are
either upregulated or downregulated together across the various
developmental stages. Hence, data from relevant contexts are
highly weighted and trusted, while irrelevant or inaccurate data
are weighted more slightly and less regarded. The results demon-
strated that the dynamic stage-speciﬁc network algorithm could
precisely reveal functional relationships that were masked in ana-
lysis of the static networks. The genes that changed most were
also conﬁrmed to be highly related to the differentiation process.
We expect that this same generic algorithm can be readily applied
to other developmental or differentiation processes, given appro-
priate time-course expression data.

For example, when predicting regulatory networks, classical
co-expressionebased analyses (Emilsson et al., 2008; Ghazalpour
et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2005) take a single time-course dataset
as its only input. These approaches are likely to be sensitive to
noise and require a considerable number of different time points
in a single dataset. Compared with classical approaches, these
transitional networks make use of the highly speciﬁc time-course
dataset together with thousands of public datasets. We expect
that combining the transitional network together with classical
co-expression networks should improve the performance of these
networks in identifying regulatory elements.

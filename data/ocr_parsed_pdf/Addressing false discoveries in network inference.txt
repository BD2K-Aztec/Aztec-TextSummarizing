Abstract

Motivation: Experimentally determined gene regulatory networks can be enriched by computa—
tional inference from high—throughput expression profiles. However, the prediction of regulatory
interactions is severely impaired by indirect and spurious effects, particularly for eukaryotes.
Recently, published methods report improved predictions by exploiting the a priori known targets
of a regulator (its local topology) in addition to expression profiles.

Results: We find that methods exploiting known targets show an unexpectedly high rate of false
discoveries. This leads to inflated performance estimates and the prediction of an excessive num—
ber of new interactions for regulators with many known targets. These issues are hidden from com—
mon evaluation and cross—validation setups, which is due to Simpson’s paradox. We suggest a
confidence score recalibration method (CoRe) that reduces the false discovery rate and enables a
reliable performance estimation.

Conclusions: CoRe considerably improves the results of network inference methods that exploit
known targets. Predictions then display the biological process specificity of regulators more cor—
rectly and enable the inference of accurate genome—wide regulatory networks in eukaryotes. For
yeast, we propose a network with more than 22 000 confident interactions. We point out that ma—
chine learning approaches outside of the area of network inference may be affected as well.

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) consist of interactions of regula—
tors such as transcription factors (TFs) that physically bind to spe—
cific nucleotide sequences to regulate the expression of target genes.
GRNs can be experimentally derived from TF—binding studies
(Gerstein et (11., 2012) such as Chromatin Immuno—Precipitation
[ChIP, Zheng et a1. (2010)] or DNase footprinting (Neph et (11.,
2012). A large fraction of the interactions reported by these

(Wu et (11., 2007). On the other hand, expression changes in poten—
tial TF targets can be detected from TF—knockout profiles (Chua
et (11., 2006). This approach, however, is prone to indirect or spuri—
ous effects (Hu et (11., 2007).

Although the number of conducted TF—binding and TF—knockout
studies is growing (Petricka and Benfey, 2011) the discovery of
novel regulations detected with each additional study decreases.

Thus, a combination of experimental results and computational in—
ference approaches is likely to provide more comprehensive
networks.

Many inference methods use expression data exclusively. An
interaction is predicted if a TF and its putative target are co—
expressed. Such expression-based approaches infer prokaryotic net—
works successfully (Faith et (11., 2007; Greenfield et (11., 2013;
Margolin et (11., 2006; Michoel et (11., 2009). However, they perform
hardly better than random for inference of eukaryotic networks
(Hu et (11., 2007; Kuffner et (11., 2012; Marbach et (11., 2012;
Michoel et (11., 2009; Narendra et (11., 2011; Soranzo et (11., 2007;
Wu and Chan, 2012), although they can achieve useful results in
special cases [e.g. for respiratory genes, Michoel et al. (2009)].
Interactions in eukaryotes are difficult to infer as observable depend—
encies between the expression of regulator and target are weaker
and context—dependent. One reason is the increased level of com—
plexity and the combinatorial nature of the eukaryotic regulation of
transcription (Neph et (11., 2012).

The prediction of novel interactions can be improved for pro—
karyotic and in silico data by exploiting a priori known interactions
[local topology priors, Greenfield et al. (2013)]. This allows to de—
termine whether a given TF is active based on the expression of its
known targets (Ciofani et (11., 2012; Naeem et (11., 2012) enabling a
more reliable prediction of novel targets (De Smet and Marchal,
2010; Mordelet and Vert, 2008; Qian et (11., 2003). See
Supplementary, Section S5 for an overview on related methods.

Here, we investigate whether eukaryotic networks are accurately
inferred by methods exploiting topology priors. First, we demon—
strate that many existing performance evaluations are misleading.
They are not adequate for local topology methods and overestimate
network quality substantially. This effect is due to Simpson’s
Paradox, well—known in causal theory (Pearl, 2009; Simpson, 1951).
Second, this also strongly inﬂuences the quality and composition of
inferred networks. We develop a simple recalibration strategy and
demonstrate how it can be applied for the inference of a confident
genome—scale regulatory network in yeast.

2 Materials and methods

Network inference methods score all pairs of regulators and putative
target genes to quantify the confidence that a given pair represents a
true interaction. For both types of inference methods discussed here,
namely expression—based methods and local topology methods, con—
fident predictions are selected by applying a unified cutoff.
Expression—based methods are based exclusively on expression data
and ignore known interactions. Local topology methods use expres—
sion data and known interactions (topology priors) to train a
so—called local model per regulator (Fig. 1).

2.1 Data

We obtained five yeast expression compendia (for details see
Supplementary, Section S2.1) from (i) the 5th DREAM Challenge
[challenge 4, Marbach et al. (2012)], (ii) the Many Microbe
Microarray Database [M3D, Faith et al. (2008)], (iii) the study of
Hu et al. (2007), (iv) the study of Chua et al. (2006) and (v) the
Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO, Barrett et al. (2011)]. Case—
control pairs were selected from 2442 yeast microarrays as
described by Kuffner et al. (2012) to compute logz fold—changes.
Thereby, we obtained a matrix M 6 [RPM with p : 1829 microarray
pairs and n : 5402 genes. We normalize M by two successive z—score
transformations of rows and columns, respectively.

We then collected experimentally supported interactions from
the Yeastract database (Abdulrehman et (11., 2011), augmented by a
study of MacIsaac et al. (2006). We filtered genes that were not con—
tained in the expression data. We excluded TFs regulating less than
six known targets to enable training and cross—validation (see later).
The resulting reference standard contains 153 TFs, 4870 target
genes and 24 462 interactions derived from 356 TF—target binding
assays.

2.2 Training and assessment of local topologies
A regulatory interaction network of 71 genes G is a directed graph
N : (GJ), G : R U T, where R is the set of regulators, T is the set
of targets and I Q R X T are regulatory interactions. Each instance
of I is a regulator—target pair (r, t) E R X T that is labeled with a
weight w” denoting the number of TF—binding studies that support
interaction (r, t).

Machine learning models are trained to predict novel regulations
(r, t) E R X T. Based on the known interactions (Supplementary,
Section $2.32), each putative regulation is labeled by l”, where l,,
is 1 if w” 2 1 and 0 otherwise. The matrix of fold—changes
M : (m,,-) 6 [RPM represents the feature vectors. The value m,,- is the
fold—change for gene / E G in array pair 1', and we denote row i by
M,-. and column / by M.,-. Then, the feature vector for (r, t) is given
by M, (Supplementary, Fig. S1).

We train \R] local models, each predicting confidence estimates
6,, specific for a single regulator r of putative regulations (r, t):

5r 1 [RP —’ [R7 5r(M.t) : art- (1)

Alternatively, a single global model is trained for all regulators
using combined feature vectors, i.e. feature vectors of regulator and
target are concatenated to represent an interaction (Supplementary,
Section S2.3)

5 2 [RPHI _’ [R7 5(M.r SEMI) : art- (2)

From all regulations, we build la splits for each model stratified
with respect to their label distribution. Cross—validation (here:
3—CV, Supplementary, Section S2.4) is performed by retaining one
split at a time and training a model on the remaining la — 1 splits, so
that interactions are either used in evaluation or training, but not
both. Every split results in \R] >l< \T] confidence values 6,, that score
all regulations (r, t) E R X T. For regulator r, we denote the distribu—
tion of these confidence values as D, (Fig. 1b and c).

The quality of inferred networks is assessed after integrating the
predictions across all regulators. Assessment compares predictions
to a reference standard of a priori known interactions, for instance
by the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC).
An AUC of 1.0 indicates that the confidence scores for the true inter—
actions are higher than those for false positives, while an AUC of
0.5 would indicate random predictions. Such a cross—validated AUC
analysis is a standard approach for the assessment of inference meth—
ods (Mordelet and Vert, 2008).

2.3 Confidence recalibration

Randomized topologies are generated to share key statistics with the
reference standard of known interactions (Fig. 1a and d). We re—
move all regulations from the network and randomly introduce new
regulations until each node la has regained its original in— and out—de—
gree [compare Dorogovtsev and Mendes (2003), p.12]. Further, the
association of expression data and genes is shufﬂed by gene label
permutation. For each of the q randomized networks N (1), . . . ,NW

we perform a CV prediction to obtain confidence values 6):) as

Fig.1. Outline of the recalibration approach. Based on the known network (a), a regulator-specific model (b) is trained to predict potential targets for this
regulator. This results in a confidence score distribution for each regulator (0). Additionally, we generate random networks (d) maintaining in- and out-degrees
from the original network and train models (e) for each random topology in the same way as for the original network. For each TF out-degree, we combine result-
ing random confidence scores into a joint distribution (f). Finally, we compare the two distributions c and f based on their respective medians (med) and maxima
(max). We minimize false discoveries by selecting regulations [shaded area in (9)] that exceed values observed for random networks

described earlier (Fig. 1). Let D?) the distribution of confidence val—
ues specific to a regulator r computed using the random prior N (i).
We then compute a joint distribution D’, that encompasses all confi—
dence values derived from random networks that are associated to
regulators of the same out—degree (Fig. 1f).

D’, denotes the randomized complement of D, By comparing
these two distributions we select interactions with scores higher
than those observed in the randomized case. Each regulation’s confi—
dence 6,, is replaced by its complement K” (Fig. 1c and g):

6,, — med(D’,)

Scores are thus recalibrated based on the median confidence med
(D’,) and the distribution scale (max(D’,) —med(D’,)). A K value
above 1.0 corresponds to a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0, i.e. to
confidence estimates not achieved in random topologies.

3 Results

3.1 Simpson’s paradox

We followed the SIRENE approach [Mordelet and Vert (2008);
Section 2] and trained local models based on support vector ma—
chines (SVMs) to predict confidence values for potential regulations.
On a large expression dataset of 2442 yeast microarrays and a
regulatory network of 24462 interactions (Section 2.1) the cross—
validated predictions achieved a network—wide AUC of 0.784.

However, we found this standard, cross—validated AUC analysis
misleading in case of methods integrating topology priors. We dem—
onstrated this by training the methods on randomized networks
(random re—assignment of targets to regulators). The confidence
scores for individual regulators are random, resulting in regulator—
specific AUC values of 0.5 (Supplementary, Section S2.3.3).
Strikingly, an evaluation across all regulators yielded an AUC of
0.798, a score above the AUC achieved by SIRENE.

These two results seem to be in conﬂict: a method that performs
randomly for each regulator induced subnetvvork should yield ran—
dom overall performance as well. This effect resembles the
Simpson’s or ‘amalgamation’ paradox (Pearl, 2009; Simpson,

1951): each of the regulator—specific distributions achieves an AUC
of 0.5, while the AUC of the joint distribution suggests non—random
performance (compare Supplementary, Section S3.1).

Here, the paradox results from the fact that predicted confidence
score distributions are heterogeneous across regulators and are char—
acterized by different scale and location parameters (Fig. 2a, light
gray boxes). In particular, score distributions for regulators with
many known targets (high out—degree) such as ste12 are wider and
systematically above average. We refer to this effect as High Degree
Preference (HDP). These regulators contribute many true positives,
i.e. after the integration higher scores become enriched for true posi—
tives. This in turn leads to non—random AUC values. Selected high—
scoring predictions thus remain unspecific while biologically more
specific signals are likely being missed (Pavlidis and Gillis, 2013).
Following this line of argument, the regulator out—degree confounds
the integration of confidence values. This is consistent with results
demonstrated for the prediction of genes involved in biological proc—
esses (Gillis and Pavlidis, 2011).

To examine whether the paradox is an artifact of SVMs we
trained further model classes (e.g. decision trees and logistic regres—
sion; Supplementary, Sections S26 and S3). We observed similar ef—
fects across all examined techniques, suggesting that regulator—specific
methods using topology priors are generally affected by an HDP.

Besides the confounding of network quality measures, the com—
position of predicted networks is also affected. We predicted net—
works by selecting high—scoring interactions using a threshold
determined from the estimated size of the complete yeast network
(Supplementary, Sections S22 and $32), which should be twice as
large as the known network. A score threshold was chosen so that
selected regulations contain 50% previously confirmed ones (the
Precision—50, or P50 network).

For a regulator with out—degree d we obtained two types of score
distributions: (i) from the model trained on its known targets and (ii)
from models trained on the targets of randomized regulators with
out—degree d (Fig. 2a). A unified cutoff selects an excessive number of
predictions for high—degree TF5 that overlap with random scores. To
quantify this, we computed the FDR based on the number of inter—
actions scored above the P50 threshold in distribution (ii) divided by
the total number of interactions above that threshold in (i) and (ii).

Fig. 2. Score recalibration in network predictions. (a) We trained SVMs for each TF (compare Supplementary, Fig. S1). Putative target genes were selected by a
threshold (horizontal line) on the resulting TF-specific scores (boxplots marked by asterics). Additional SVMs were trained on random networks (light gray) and
FDRs were computed for all regulators but those such as Xbp1where no predictions were made. (b) The density map displays whether predicted and known tar-
gets of the same TF overlap in their biological function. Positive z—scores (abscissa) indicate significant function overlaps for corresponding scores (ordinate). (c)
Score distributions (marked by asterics) were recalibrated via randomized distributions (light gray): for each TF, the median med (dotted line) and maximum
max (dashed line) are mapped to 0.0 and 1.0, respectively. Panels (d) and (e) show boxplots, threshold, and a density map of function overlap after recalibration.
Panel (f) plots the FDR as a function of the number of predicted interactions. Arrows indicate the number of interactions achieving a precision of at least 50%
(P50). In (g), the ratio of predicted to gold standard targets (ordinate) is depicted across the range of TF out-degrees (:number of gold standard targets, abscissa)

before and after recalibration

For example, the FDR is 44.4% for high—degree ste12 and 22% across
all TF5 (Fig. 2f), which is unacceptably high. In contrast to ste12, all
predictions are rejected in case of low—degree TF5 such as cat8, even if
they substantially exceed random scores (Fig. 2a). Only 81 of 153 TF5
(53%) receive predictions. We concluded that neither cross—validation
nor AUC analysis are sufficient to ensure the overall quality of net—
works inferred using structural priors.

We also assessed whether TF5 frequently regulate the expression
of targets that share similar biological functions (Segal et (11., 2003).
We therefore tested whether known and predicted targets of the same
TF exhibit substantial functional overlaps (Supplementary, Section
$28). We observed that the high proportion of random scores (e.g.
for ste12) concealed most of the signal as interactions with higher
scores hardly showed an increased functional coherence (Fig. 2b).

3.2 Correction through score recalibration

We introduce a confidence recalibration (CoRe) as a wrapper for
existing methods (Section 2.3). Based on the random networks, we
derived expected location (median score) and scale (maximum
score) properties for each out—degree d and used them to transform
the predicted confidences into topology—corrected scores. Scores for
each regulator are recalibrated by scaling the median and maximum
scores to 0 and 1, respectively (Fig. 2c). This renders score distribu—
tions comparable so that they can be integrated across TF5.
The FDR is then 0 for predictions with scores above 1 as they ap—
pear only for the true but not for the randomized networks.
Thus, interactions for each regulator selected after CoRe are scored
above the random level.

To obtain a P5 0 network, we select interactions that achieve a
corrected score of > 0.92. The FDR for this network was reduced
to 1.4% (as compared with 22.0% without recalibration).
We observed that predictions are now balanced across TF degrees
(Fig. 2g), predicting interactions for 138 TF5 versus 81 without
recalibration.

To gain further insight in the nature of the corrected network, we
estimated the functional relationship between known and novel predicted
targets (Supplementary, Section S2.8). Regulatory patterns were more co—
herent for the corrected network (compare Figs 2b and e).

3.3 Application of CoRe to network inference

For all subsequent methods and analyses we report corrected results.
To evaluate the yeast regulatory network obtained, we conducted a
comparative assessment of frequently used inference approaches and
a consensus approach (Supplementary, Sections $2.34 and $26).
The approaches are roughly classified by five attributes (Fig. 3a and
Supplementary, Section S5):

1. method: unsupervised expression—based (Faith et (11., 2007) ver—
sus supervised using a structure prior;

2. formulation: one—class (Mordelet and Vert, 2010) versus two—
class that treat unknown interactions as informative;

3. strategy: lazy (Supplementary, Section S5) versus parameterized
models;

4. data handling: non—integrative versus integrative e.g. using
TF—binding site preferences (Ernst et (11., 2008);

5. models: global (Yip et (11., 2009) versus local (regulator—speciﬁc).

Fig. 3. Assessment of predicted interactions. We analyzed the predictions of 11 different inference methods across five yeast gene expression compendia. (a)

The dendrogram groups methods according to the similarity of their predictions. Properties that discriminate between different classes of methods are indicated

by the check boxes. Panel (b) shows if interactions in particular network motifs are easier (dark) or harder (light) to detect in comparison to all interactions. In (c)
method performance (AUC) and the number of interactions predicted at a precision of 50% or better (P50) (bars with dotted borders) are assessed. Furthermore,
we encoded experimentally determined targets of TF5 into additional features (bars with solid borders, Supplementary, Sections 82.6.8 and 83.9) and integrated
methods 6—10 into a consensus approach (method 11). Panel (d) illustrates mean results from integrating all subsets of c : 1...5 compendia and m : 1...5 meth-

ods. All results are based on recalibrated scores

SIRENE (Mordelet and Vert, 2008) is a supervised, two—class,
parameterized, non—integrative, local approach. For all methods, we
predicted confidence scores in a 3—CV scheme and recalibrated them
as described earlier.

Subsequently, we analyzed network motifs (Supplementary,
Section S2.7) to capture method— and topology—specific preferences
(Fig. 3b). Unsupervised, expression—based approaches do not use
topology priors but infer interactions if expression profiles of TF5
and putative targets are mutually dependent. An example is CLR
(context likelihood of relatedness, Faith et (11., 2007). These methods
are unable to detect auto—regulation as in this case both expression
profiles would be identical. Confirming previous findings (Marbach
et (11., 2012), expression—based approaches could hardly detect feed—
forward motifs or the correct direction of interactions. In contrast,
regulator—specific approaches were less affected by such difficult
cases and exhibited a consistently higher performance. For cascades
and low in—degree targets, a slight decrease in performance was
observed. Potentially, the latter indicated the prediction of novel
regulators for genes that were less well—studied previously.

Next, we evaluated the performance of approaches across all
interactions. Expression—based, one—class, and lazy learners per—
formed substantially worse than the remaining methods (Fig. 3c).
We observed that integrative methods like Serend (Ernst et (11.,
2008) suffered from false positive predictions. This is likely due to
the low specificity of positional weight matrices [PWM5, Holloway
et al. (2008)] predicting targets only for 6.5% of all TF5
(Supplementary, Section S3). These methods were not further ana—
lyzed. Of the remaining five methods (methods 5—12 in Fig. 3), the
best results were obtained from regulator—specific SVMs and deci—
sion trees trained on bootstrap samples (bagging). See
Supplementary, Section $39 for methodological extensions such as
the integration of multiple predictors to perform a consensus
prediction.

3.4 A comprehensive yeast network

Our final yeast network includes 22 231 interactions with 15 3 TF5
and 3747 target genes. Of all predicted regulations, 12 869 are con—
tained in the reference standard, while 9362 are novel predictions.
The remaining 24, 462 — 12, 869 : 11, 593 reference standard inter—
actions (Supplementary, Fig. S4a) lacked an observable effect on ex—
pression and were thus not included.

The visualization and interpretation of organism—wide net—
works is challenging due to their size and complexity. Instead of
fully depicting each regulator, target and their interactions, we
employed a modular visualization. We derived regulatory modules
by grouping TF5 with overlapping target sets and, vice versa,
target modules by grouping genes regulated by overlapping sets of
TF5. We connected regulator and target modules via meta-
interactions if >40% of all induced regulator—target pairs were
connected. This reduced representation featured 13 meta—
interactions among 9 target and 9 regulatory modules, capturing
half of the final interactions (11232 interactions, 50.5% of all
predicted). See Figure 4 for an excerpt (full details are in
Supplementary, Sections S2.9 and S6, accessible through clickable
maps, see availability).

This modular view enables an integrated display of the network
as well as module—associated expression profiles. Given current data
and knowledge, the respective TF—modules likely control the form—
ing of transcriptional response patterns in the regulated target mod—
ules. Some key aspects of module—associated expression profiles are
summarized below (for a comprehensive literature review on all net—
work modules see Supplementary, Section S6). A representative gene
was selected manually for each module.

The 17th module features the most versatile regulation in our
network, regulated by three different TF clusters comprising the
highest total number of TF5 (Fig. 4). According to GO (The Gene
Ontology Consortium, 2010), most of the 190 genes of the 17th

Fig. 4. Interactions and expression profiles. We partitioned our network of 22 231 gene regulatory interactions for visualization and identification of network mod-
ules. We derived (a) 9 clusters of 61 TFs that, via (b) 13 interactions between clusters (arrows), regulate (c) 9 clusters of 1758 target genes (excerpt of five TF and
five target clusters connected by nine interactions shown here, Supplementary, Section Se for full figure). A representative gene is displayed for each TF and tar-
get cluster. Cluster interaction maps (black: interaction, white : no interaction) comprise a total of 11 232 (50.5%) interactions. (d) Thus, depicted TF-modules are
likely to trigger expression responses in respective target modules and associated processes (top part of heatmap). The heatmaps display the differential expres-
sion of these target modules under the indicated knockout (K0) and other experimental conditions (bottom part) (Color version of this figure is available at

Bioin formatics on line.)

cluster belong either to sugar transport (loxt genes) or glycogen
metabolic process (e.g. gacl). Consequently, we observe differen—
tial expression of these genes under low— versus high—glucose
growth conditions. When glucose is available, the sugar trans—
porters are abundantly expressed (Ozcan and Johnston, 1995),
whereas under glucose starvation glycogen storage is catabolized
to produce glucose preferably for fermentation (Frangois and
Parrou, 2001).

The pdrl (pleiotropic drug response) cluster comprised the larg—
est number of 17th regulators. It consisted of 16 TF5, all tightly con—
nected to the cellular response to drug and nutrition stress such as
differing glucose concentrations. Despite this general response medi—
ated by the pdr TF5 (stb5 and msnl), much of the regulation was
performed by pseudohyphal growth TF5 (nrgl, mgal and ashl) in
conditions of nitrogen limitation and abundant fermentable carbon
sources like glucose (Lorenz and Heitman, 1998).

Interestingly, a strong regulatory impact on the 17th module was
also observed for regulators of the oxidative stress response—on the
one hand from the cadl cluster (5 TF5, also responding to resulting
DNA damage), and, on the other hand, from the te61 cluster (11
TF5, also driving pseudohyphal growth). Oxidative stress results in
cellular protection mechanisms, e.g. DNA repair and targeted pro—
tein degradation, which is associated with increased energy con—
sumption (Morano et (11., 2012), initiated by the 17th cluster via
increased glucose uptake.

4 Discussion

GRNs are crucial to understand how regulators like TF5 affect their
target genes on the expression level. Experimentally derived

networks are typically incomplete as the number of available experi—
ments is limited. To complement them, computational inference of
networks has been introduced. We revealed critical aspects but also
demonstrated that inference is necessary and feasible in eukaryotes.

Even in well—studied eukaryotes such as yeast, where N900 pub—
lications on experimental TF—binding studies are available, current
networks are far from complete and benefit from computational
predictions. We found that only about half of all regulations that in—
duce detectable expression changes (‘active’ interactions) are cur—
rently known. In addition, experimental techniques are prone to
discover regulations without effect on the expression level. We
applied computational inference both for the detection of novel ac—
tive and the pruning of inactive regulations.

We reported three crucial findings based on the analysis of a
wide spectrum of data—driven inference methods (for reviews see De
Smet and Marchal 2010; Myers et (11., 2006). First, we demonstrated
that methods incorporating experimentally derived interactions as
topology priors possess sufficient predictive power for the inference
of eukaryotic networks. Methods using expression data alone fail
here (Marbach et (11., 2012; Narendra et (11., 2011). We also showed
that topology priors lead to Simpson’s paradox (Pearl, 2009;
Simpson, 1951) distorting prediction and assessment of regulatory
interactions. Finally, we showed how to avoid the occurrence of the
paradox.

Generally, network inference methods that exploit the local top—
ology assign an excessive number of predictions to TF5 with many
known targets (Ambroise et (11., 2012; De Smet and Marchal, 2010),
and it has been doubted whether a correction is possible or sensible
(Gillis and Pavlidis, 2011; Myers et (11., 2006). Our analysis revealed
that the number of known targets for a regulator is a confounder of
regulator—target predictions. This effect is not detected by common

cross—validation routines: surprisingly, the same performance re—
ported for published network inference approaches can be achieved
by guessing random regulations. We developed a CoRe approach
wrapping existing methods and showed that it corrected for both
the over—estimation of performance and the distortion of the top—
ology toward TF5 with many known targets (HDP).

We conducted a comprehensive assessment of methods integrat—
ing topology priors and identified methods suitable to derive a cor—
rected, accurate yeast regulatory network of active regulations. We
describe disadvantages of several methods, which we excluded due
to prediction performance, or the inadequate scale—up for large ex—
pression datasets. Our evaluation suggested that the selected meth—
ods detect several types of interactions successfully that are difficult
to predict. For instance, auto—regulatory interactions and the assign—
ment of directions are handled accurately, and immediate and indir—
ect interactions could be distinguished. We then integrated the
predictions from the selected methods to construct a network con—
sisting of half novel and half experimentally determined regulations.
This choice was based on our extrapolation of the size of the com—
plete yeast network. Our final yeast network (see availability) con—
tains 153 TF5 that regulate 3747 target genes via 22 231
interactions. These include many novel and confident hypotheses of
regulatory relationships, while we expect less than 150 false posi—
tives in total. At the same time, we reject more than half of the ex—
perimentally determined interactions as they appear to be without
observable regulatory effect.

To gain an overview of the network, we derived modules of
target genes that were jointly regulated by sets of TF5. The resulting
modular structure was strikingly simple featuring 13 meta—
regulations that represent an index for inspecting the expression
effects of interactions. A thorough literature review confirmed that
the modules and their expression patterns correspond well to biolo—
gical processes such as respiration, sulfate/energy metabolism, trans—
port, stress response and cell division.

We conclude that methods integrating local topology can
extend known networks substantially and at a high reliability,
even in well—studied model organisms. These methods, in contrast to
those using expression data alone, are well—suited for the prediction
of interactions in yeast and presumably other eukaryotes. Due
to Simpson’s paradox, however, their application was more
difficult than previously acknowledged and required a correction
approach. We emphasize that topology, structural priors and para—
meterized models are widely applied beyond network inference
(Supplementary, Section S5 for an overview) and encourage a review
of fields that may benefit from confidence recalibration strategies
such as CoRe.

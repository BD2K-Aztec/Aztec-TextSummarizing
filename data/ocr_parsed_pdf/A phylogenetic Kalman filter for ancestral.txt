ABSTRACT

Motivation: Correlation between life history or ecological traits and
genomic features such as nucleotide or amino acid composition can
be used for reconstructing the evolutionary history of the traits of inter-
est along phylogenies. Thus far, however, such ancestral reconstruc-
tions have been done using simple linear regression approaches that
do not account for phylogenetic inertia. These reconstructions could
instead be seen as a genuine comparative regression problem, such
as formalized by classical generalized least-square comparative meth-
ods, in which the trait of interest and the molecular predictor are rep-
resented as correlated Brownian characters coevolving along the
phylogeny.

Results: Here, a Bayesian sampler is introduced, representing an al-
ternative and more efficient algorithmic solution to this comparative
regression problem, compared with currently existing generalized
least-square approaches. Technically, ancestral trait reconstruction
based on a molecular predictor is shown to be formally equivalent
to a phylogenetic Kalman filter problem, for which backward and for-
ward recursions are developed and implemented in the context of a
Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. The comparative regression
method results in more accurate reconstructions and a more faithful
representation of uncertainty, compared with simple linear regression.
Application to the reconstruction of the evolution of optimal growth
temperature in Archaea, using GC composition in ribosomal RNA
stems and amino acid composition of a sample of protein-coding
genes, confirms previous findings, in particular, pointing to a
hyperthermophilic ancestor for the kingdom.

1 INTRODUCTION

There is a growing interest in reconstructing the evolutionary
history of quantitative traits along phylogenies using information
coming from genetic sequences. In those cases where the evolu-
tion of genes or genomes is inﬂuenced by ecological or life his-
tory traits, the ancestral sequences, which can be reconstructed
over the tree using phylogenetic methods, will contain useful in-
formation about ancestral values of the trait. One of the first

applications of this idea was to the reconstruction of ancestral
optimal growth temperatures based on ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
nucleotide composition (Galtier et al., 1999), or amino acid com-
position of the proteome (Boussau et al., 2008; Groussin and
Gouy, 2011), although in principle, the same idea could be
applied to other cellular, ecological or morphological traits
that would correlate with genetic sequences.

In its original formulation, the sequence-trait correlation
approach proceeds in several steps. First, the correlation between
the trait and the molecular predictor (in the aforementioned
example, the trait being temperature and the predictor rRNA
or protein composition) is characterized in extant species.
Typically, a regression analysis is conducted, yielding an estimate
of the slope and the intercept of the linear regression of the trait
against the predictor. Second, ancestral sequences, and thus
ancestral values of the molecular predictor, are inferred using
molecular phylogenetic methods. Finally, the values of the pre-
dictor inferred in the ancestors along the phylogeny are
translated into estimates of ancestral traits, based on the
regression.

This approach is simple and straightforward to implement.
One potential problem, however, is that it does not take into
account phylogenetic inertia. In the present context, the phylo-
genetic structure underlying both the trait and the molecular
predictor has at least two important consequences. First, the
correlation measured in extant taxa between the trait and the
molecular predictor should be corrected for the non-independ-
ence between data points (Felsenstein, 1985). Second, ancestral
reconstructions could possibly benefit from the fact that inertia
effectively induces an intertemporal smoothing of the reconstruc-
tion across neighboring nodes along the phylogeny.

An alternative to the stepwise regression method would be to
use a fully integrated comparative and phylogenetic approach,
modeling the joint correlated evolution of the trait and the se-
quences and conditioning the resulting hierarchical model simul-
taneously on genetic sequences and quantitative data (Lartillot,
2013; Lartillot and Poujol, 2011). This would account not only
for phylogenetic inertia but also for all sources of uncertainty
associated with the unknown parameters of the model. However,
in some cases, proceeding in a stepwise manner, dividing the
problem into smaller and computationally more manageable
tasks, can be more practical. Also, some interesting situations,
in particular involving trait-dependent stabilizing selection on
sequence composition, are not so easily modeled directly at the

level of the substitution process, as they induce interdependence
among sites of the alignment.

A middle-ground solution, explored here, still relies on a pre-
liminary estimation of ancestral sequence compositions along the
tree using a phylogenetic program. Thus, ancestral composition
is here treated as known and inferred separately from the model
to be presented later in the text. On the other hand, the estima-
tion of the correlation between composition and trait and the
ancestral reconstruction of the trait are merged into one single
step, explicitly formalized as a comparative regression problem.
Similar models have been developed in the context of generalized
least-square methods (Martins and Hansen, 1997; Pagel, 1999)
and used for reconstructing, among other things, ancestral
genome sizes of extinct lineages (Franks et al., 2012; Organ
et al., 2007).

Once reconsidered in the context of the comparative method,
the question is typically formulated in terms of a multivariate
process jointly encompassing the trait of interest and the molecu-
lar predictor. Mathematically, a process Z(t) is deﬁned, running
along the branches of the phylogeny and combining the trait of
interest X(t) and the molecular predictor Y(t). In the case of
rRNA stems, X (t) would be the temperature, Y(t) some function
of the GC content of RNA stems, so that Z(t) would be a bivari-
ate process. In more general settings, both X(t) and Y(t) could
themselves be multivariate. Under the Brownian assumption, the
joint posterior distribution over the values of the trait X and the
predictor Y over the phylogeny is multivariate normal and can be
compactly represented using the Kronecker product formalism
(e.g. as in Felsenstein, 2008; Revell and Collar, 2009).
Conditioning this distribution on observed values for the trait
and/or the predictor at the relevant nodes of the phylogeny can
be done by maximum likelihood, using multivariate normal
theory and matrix calculus aVIartins and Hansen, 1997) or in a
Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) context, using
standard MetropolisiHastings algorithms (Pagel, 1999).

Equivalently, standard multivariate normal theory allows for a
reformulation of this model, such that the joint variation of the
trait X and the predictor Y over the time interval At represented
by a branch of the phylogenetic tree is written as follows:

X(t + At): X(t) + e,

AY(t) = BAX(t) + n,

where e, and r], are normally distributed residual errors and B is
a linear operator. This reformulation suggests a hierarchical
structure in which a (partially) hidden state, the trait X, evolves
along the phylogeny according to its own Brownian generator,
effectively undergoing discrete-time transitions from one node of
the tree (at time t) to the next (at time t+ At) according to a
multivariate normal kernel (the distribution of 5,). Before each
such transition, the process emits, along the branch just Visited,
an observable quantity, the predictor AY(t) = Y(t + At) — Y(t),
whose distribution linearly depends on the hidden states at both
ends of the branch (through AX(t) = X(t + At) — X(t)). Based
on the observed history of the predictor Y along the phylogeny
and the observed values of X at the tips, the aim is to reconstruct
the hidden evolutionary history of X. This reformulation sug-
gests an analogy with hidden Markov models or, more

speciﬁcally, as all distributions are normal, with what is known
in particle ﬁltering and tracking as the Kalman filter (Jazwinski,
1970; Kalman, 1960).

There are several differences between the classical Kalman ﬁlter
and its phylogenetic counterpart introduced here. In particular, in
the classical Kalman ﬁlter, the emitted state only depends on the
current state, whereas in the phylogenetic model, the emitted state
AY(t) depends on both the current and the previous hidden
states. Also, the classical Kalman ﬁlter unfolds along a linear
time frame, whereas the phylogenetic model is branched in
time. However, these differences are minor and do not comprom-
ise the most important property of the Kalman ﬁlter, namely, its
convenient analytical tractability, leading to simple and compu-
tationally efﬁcient recursions for integrating and resampling
hidden states along the phylogeny using dynamic programming
methods and elementary matrix algebra. Importantly, such recon-
structions will automatically integrate both the across-time
smoothing effect between neighboring nodes for the trait X(t)
and the additional information provided by the local behavior
of the predictor AY(t) about the local evolution of the trait
X (t). The Kalman approach introduced here and the generalized
least-square approaches mentioned earlier in the text (Martins
and Hansen, 1997; Pagel, 1999) are similar. The main difference
is algorithmic, the Kalman ﬁlter having a globally lower algorith-
mic complexity than the algebraic and the MetropolisiHastings
approaches, as will be detailed later in the text.

In this article, the phylogenetic Kalman filter is introduced and
formalized. Backward and forward recursions are established
and are used in the context of a Bayesian MCMC sampler, as
a Gibbs sampling method for updating the X component of the
model. This Gibbs sampling approach is then combined with
another previously described conjugate Gibbs sampling algo-
rithm for updating the correlation matrix (Lartillot and Poujol,
2011). The combination of the two algorithms results in an
efﬁcient alternating Gibbs strategy for sampling from the joint
posterior distribution over the unknown parameters. Finally, the
phylogenetic Kalman filter is applied to the reconstruction of
ancestral growth temperatures in Archaea.

2 METHODS
2.1 Model

The phylogenetic tree is here considered as known, with the topology and
the branch lengths ﬁxed throughout. The model assumes that a multi-
variate Brownian process Z(t) runs along the lineages of the phylogeny,
splitting into two independent processes after each cladogenetic event.
This process, of dimension M = L +K, has two subcomponents, X(t),
of dimension L, representing the quantitative trait to be reconstructed
along the phylogeny, and Y(t), of dimension K, representing the molecu-
lar predictor. For instance, X(t) can be thought of as being the optimal
growth temperature (L = 1) and Y(t) the GC content of the rRNA stems
(K: 1) or the suitably transformed amino acid composition of the prote-
ome (K = 19 degrees of freedom). As a Brownian process, Z(t) is para-
meterized by an M x M precision matrix Q. The precision matrix, which
is the inverse of the covariance matrix, is used here for mathematical
convenience, as it leads to easier computation in the context of the
Kalman ﬁltering recursion. The variation of Z over a finite amount of
time t is normally distributed, with covariance proportional to t:

Z(t) — 2(0) ~ N(0, tntl)

The value of the process at the root, Z(O), is an independent parameter of
the model. The predictor variable Y(t) is assumed to be known with
certainty at each node of the tree (in practice, it is reconstructed using
a phylogenetic method, see later in the text). As for the quantitative trait
of interest X (t), it is known only at the tips (corresponding to extant taxa).
A Wishart prior is used for S2, of parameter S20 and m = K+ L de-
grees of freedom. The hyperparameter S20 is a diagonal matrix, which is
partitioned according to the X and the Y components of the process:

_ KXIL 0
90 — ( 0 KyIK)

where I L and I K are the identity matrices of dimension L and K, respect-
ively, and KX and K}, are two hyperparameters, themselves endowed
with an improper log-uniform prior. An improper uniform prior is
used for X(O).

2.2 Markov chain Monte Carlo

MCMC sampling proceeds by alternating between updates of S2 and
updates of X. Updates of Q are done by Gibbs sampling, using the fact
that the Wishart prior on Q is conjugate to the multivariate normal dis-
tribution (see Lartillot and Poujol, 2011). Updates of X are done either by
MetropolisiHastings (as in Lartillot and Poujol, 2011) or by Gibbs sam-
pling, using a Kalman ﬁlter algorithm which is now described.

2.3 The Kalman ﬁlter

The subdivision of the process Z as a L-dimensional component X and a
K-dimensional component Y leads to a natural block representation of S2:

_ 9,, 9,,

Given an internal node n, its parent node is denoted as u (up), and its
two daughter nodes are referred to as nodes 1 (left) and r (right). The root
node is referred to as node 0. For a given node n, X,, denotes the random
variable representing the instant value of the trait at node n. If n is not the
root node, and u is its parent, A Y,, denotes the variation in the value of
the predictor between node u and node n, AZ,, the corresponding vari-
ation in the entire process Z and 1),, stands for the inverse of the length of
the branch leading from node u to node n. For any node n, D” refers to all
of the data that are downstream to node n.

The conditional likelihood at node n is deﬁned as the probability dens-
ity of the data downstream to node n (i.e. the values of x at the tips and
the values of y at all nodes downstream to and including node n), con-
ditional on the value taken by X,,:

Ln(xn) =p(Dan = xn)
or, for short:
Ln(xn) =p(Dnlxn)

The conditional likelihood is not a probability density as a function of x”.
On the other hand, as the process is Brownian, the conditional likelihood
is a (possibly degenerate) multivariate Gaussian function, entirely char-
acterized, up to a multiplicative constant, by its mean it" and its precision
matrix K,,:

LAX”) (X 6";(XM’ILMYKMOCM’ILM) (1)

The multiplicative constant is not needed here, where the interest is in
sampling from the posterior distribution, not in computing the marginal
likelihood.

The Kalman ﬁltering algorithm proceeds in two steps: a backward and
a forward recursion. The backward recursion proceeds from the tips to
the root. Its aim is to compute the conditional likelihoods at all nodes.
This is done recursively, by expressing, for each node n, the conditional
likelihood Ln(x,,) as a function of the conditional likelihoods of the

left and right descendants, L,(x,) and L,(x,). Because these conditional
likelihoods are Gaussian, this is equivalent to expressing the mean it" and
the precision K,, in terms of m, p.“ K, and K,. Next, the forward recursion
proceeds from the root to the tips. Its aim is to recursively sample
the values of X at all ancestral nodes from the joint posterior distribution.
This is done by ﬁrst sampling the value X0 at the root. Then, once X,,
has been sampled at node n, X, and X, are sampled from their conditional
posterior distributionp(X, = x,an = x", D,) andp(X, = x,|X,, = x", D,),
until the recursion has proceeded down to the tips of the tree.

Therefore, the calculation is analogous to what is done for mapping
ancestral states along phylogenies (Nielsen, 2002). The backward recur-
sion more specifically corresponds to the so-called pruning algorithm for
computing the likelihood under a ﬁnite state Markov substitution process
(Felsenstein, 1981), with the only difference that discrete sums are
replaced by continuous integrals. The algebra is detailed in the
Supplementary Material. The essential steps are now summarized.

First proceeding with the backward recursion and using the Markov
property, the conditional likelihood at node n can be expressed as a
product of the probabilities of D, and D,, which are independent given X,,:

17(0an = M) =I7(DllX = xn)p(DrlX = Xn) (2)

Considering only the left component (similar results holding for the right
node by symmetry), p(D,|X,, = x") is an integral over all possible values
of X,:

17(01an = Xn) = /P(DIIX1 = X01700 = )0an = xn)dxl
abbreviated as follows:
pwmn=fmammmmwm a)

The finite-time probability of transition along the branch going from
node n to node I, p(X, = x,|X,, = x"), is Gaussian. To characterize its
moments, one can observe that the variation undergone by Z(t) along
the branch leading from node n to node 1 follows a normal distribution:

_ AX! ~ 71 71
AZ,_(AYI) N(0,v, s2 )

By standard multivariate normal theory, this implies that:
AXllAy, ~ N(m,, u;19;,})
where 9;; is to be understood as [QMT1 (the matrix inverse of S2“), and
m, = 42;; myAy,

This gives the probability density of going from x” to x, along the branch
going from node n to node I:

p(xl|xn) (X e’jl(Xlixn’mlyvlgxxoclixnTm!) (4)

Second, multiplying p(D,|X, = x,) and p(X, = x,an = x") yields the
joint probability p(D,, X, = x,an = x"), which, after some algebra, can
be rearranged as follows:

[7(Dl, xllxn) (X [knew/Alarm) e’%(xn’VI)/MI(XM’VI)

Integrating over x, eliminates the ﬁrst exponential factor:
[7(Dlan = x") (X eilmeyn/MKXWW)

One can also note (as this will be useful later on) that

P(DI,X1|Xn)
X D = — l

Finally, taking the product of the left and right components leads to:

[7(Dnlxn) (X ez¥xnzyI)/MI(Xn*}/I) e*%(xnzyr)/Mr(xnzyr)

(X 67%(Xn’lln)/Kn(xn’llm)

where

Kn =Ml+Mr (12)

it. = K;1[Mm + Mm] (13)

The backward recursion is initiated at the tips by setting y, = x, — m, and
M, 2 11,9“, if x, is observed. Otherwise, if information about x, is miss-
ing, y, and M, can be set to 0 (the conditional likelihood, being ﬂat, can
be seen as the limit of a multivariate normal of vanishing precision and
undeﬁned mean).

The forward recursion starts from the root (node 0). By Bayes
theorem:

[7(X0 ID) (X P(D|X0)I7(X0)
(X e*%(xo*uo)/K0(onuo)

that is, the posterior is proportional to the conditional likelihood, as the
prior on x0 is uniform. Therefore, X0 can be sampled from its normal
conditional posterior:

XolD ~ N(uo. K31).

Once the value X,, of the trait has been sampled for a given internal node
n, then if node I is also internal, X, can be sampled from its conditional
posterior which, according to the above derivation [Equation (11)], is
given by:

XIID.xn ~ N(a,.A;1)

The same formula can be applied by symmetry to node r, and the forward
recursion can thus proceed down to the tips of the tree.

The overall algorithm has a complexity linear in the number of taxa N.
In addition, as each step of the recursion involves products of matrices of
dimension L or K and inversion of matrices of dimension L, the com-
plexity scales as K2L3N. As mentioned in the introduction, the problem
can also be formalized by calculating the mean vector and the covariance
matrix of the joint posterior distribution of the values of the trait X over
the phylogeny, which is multivariate normal (Martins and Hansen, 1997).
However, sampling from this joint posterior distribution, or even max-
imizing the likelihood, entails matrix calculation such as inversion or
Cholesky decomposition on the covariance matrix, which is here of di-
mension N(L + K) x N(L + K). Therefore, the complexity of this direct
approach scales as N3(L + K)3, making the Kalman ﬁltering approach a
more attractive alternative, at least in a Bayesian context.

In addition to X and Q, the model has two hyperparameters, KX and
Ky. These two parameters are resampled from the conditional posterior
distribution by standard MetropolisiHastings. Therefore, the overall
schedule consists of one call to the Kalman ﬁlter algorithm, followed
by one call to the conjugate Gibbs resampling method on Q, followed
by a series of ﬁve updates of Kx and Ky. The chains are run for at least
100 000 cycles, saving one every 10 points. Two independent chains are

run under each condition. Convergence is first checked visually and
then quantitatively assessed using the tracecomp program in the
PhyloBayes package (Lartillot et al., 2009). The tracecomp program esti-
mates the effective sample size and the overlap between the two inde-
pendent chains. In practice, all effective sample sizes were found to
be>1000.

2.4 Calculating ancestral compositions

The two datasets analyzed in this study, previously introduced in
Groussin and Gouy (2011), were kindly provided by the authors.
Bayesian phylogenetic inference was conducted using a site- and time-
heterogeneous model implemented in PhyloBayes (Lartillot et al., 2009),
corresponding to the branchwise version of the model presented in
Blanquart and Lartillot (2008). Speciﬁcally, across sites, the model is a
Dirichlet process mixture of F81 processes (Lartillot and Philippe, 2004),
with the equilibrium frequencies of this mixture of process jointly modu-
lated across branches by introducing branch-speciﬁc modulating proﬁles,
independently drawn from a hyperparameterized Dirichlet distribution
(Blanquart and Lartillot, 2006, 2008). Chains were run for 11000
points, saving one every 10 points and excluding a burn-in of 1000
points. All runs were duplicated.

For a subset or 1000 regularly spaced points obtained from the
MCMC sample produced by PhyloBayes, ancestral sequences were re-
constructed by stochastic mapping (Nielsen, 2002; Rodrigue et al., 2008),
and the corresponding ancestral compositions at each node were com-
puted. Ancestral compositions were averaged over the 1000 points
sampled by MCMC and were used as an input for the phylogenetic co-
variance analysis. Alternatively, as a way of taking into account uncer-
tainty about ancestral reconstructions, ancestral compositions were
computed and saved separately for each of a subset of 100 points from
the MCMC sample. Each set of ancestral compositions thereby produced
was used as a separate dataset in the downstream phylogenetic covariance
analysis, and the resulting MCMC samples were pooled, thus represent-
ing a sample from a mixture of 100 posterior distributions. The analyses
under PhyloBayes were conducted on the complete alignment of the
4S archaeal and eubacterial sequences. In a second step, only the com-
positions corresponding to the subtree spanned by the 33 archeal species
were considered for the phylogenetic covariance analysis. Thus,
eubacteria are only used here for polarizing the reconstruction of ances-
tral compositions, whereas the covariance analysis is restricted to
Archaea.

Before being used in the phylogenetic covariance analysis, the ancestral
compositions were log-transformed as follows. In the case of rRNA, the
logit transform of the GC content was used as the molecular predictor y.
Thus, if q is the GC content of the ancestral sequence reconstructed at a
given node, then the corresponding value of the molecular predictor is
deﬁned to be as follows:

q
1—q

 

y=l11

This change of variable maps the unit interval onto the real line.

In the case of proteins, ancestral compositions were ﬁrst log-trans-
formed and offset so as to sum to 0. Thus, if it = (21,)“:lnzo, 211,, = 1
is the amino acid composition at a given point of time, the fbllowing
variable is defined as follows:

¢a=l11ﬂa—A

The resulting 20-dimensional vector d) can be assumed to evolve accord-
ing to a Brownian motion constrained to live within the 19-dimensional

hyperplane deﬁned by H = {(1), Z“ (1),, = 0}. To deal with this additional
linear restriction, an orthonormal basis of the 20-dimensional space is
introduced, V: (vab)1<a,b<20, such that its ﬁrst vector v, is the unit
vector orthogonal to [17: 7

1
v1“ _ m, a _1..20
The 19 remaining vectors of the basis are determined randomly using the
Gramischmidt process method. The incomplete basis P = (v,,),c:zn20 is
then a basis of the H subspace. Expressing the ancestral log compositions
d) in this basis requires to operate a linear change of variable on :1),
resulting in a 19-dimensional predictor:

Y: P¢> (14)

The model induced by Equation (14) is independent of the choice of the
basis P. It is also invariant by permutation of the 20 amino acids. This is
because the prior over the generator of the Brownian motion Q (the
Wishart of parameter S20) is invariant by rotation in the Y subspace.
Although the log transformation proposed here is convenient, other
transformations could also be considered based on more mechanistic
derivations. Alternatively, this aspect of the model could be addressed
using non-parametric approaches for estimating the transformation.

3 RESULTS

3.1 MCMC mixing

The Gibbs sampler based on the Kalman filter, hereafter called
the KalmaniGibbs sampler, was tested against a more classical
MetropolisiHastings sampling method. As expected, both sam-
plers give indistinguishable conﬁdence intervals (Table 1).
However, the Gibbs algorithm appears to be faster and more
efﬁcient than classical MetropolisiHastings under all conditions.
The improvement over the MetropolisiHastings sampler is mod-
erate for low-dimensional problems (L: 1). On the other hand,
the advantage of using the KalmaniGibbs sampler over the
MetropolisiHastings alternative is overwhelming for higher di-
mensional traits (L: 10), for which a dense sample from the
posterior distribution is obtained within a few hours using the
KalmaniGibbs sampler, whereas several days would be needed
with the MetropolisiHastings algorithm to obtain an equivalent
effective sample size.

3.2 Accuracy and conﬁdence

The simplest alternative to the comparative method is to perform
a simple linear regression between the predictor and the trait in
extant species. The estimated slope and intercept can then be
used to predict the value of the trait based on the value of the
predictor in the ancestors. This linear regression method has
been used in previously published reconstructions (Boussau
et al., 2008; Galtier et al., 1999; Groussin and Gouy, 2011). To
compare its performance with that of the KalmaniGibbs sam-
pler, simulation experiments were conducted, using the archaeal
dataset used below (33 taxa) as a template, a 2D model (with one
predictor and one quantitative trait) and under four conﬁgur-
ations of the precision matrix (2, with the correlation coefﬁcient
between the predictor and the trait ranging from 0.35 to 0.95.

Compared with the linear regression method, the Kalmani
Gibbs sampler results in more accurate ancestral reconstructions
(Fig. 1A). The root mean squared errors (RMSE) under the
KalmaniGibbs sampler are approximately twice as small as
those incurred under the linear regression method (Table 2). In
both cases, RMSE are globally smaller when the correlation be-
tween the trait and the predictor is strong, indicating that recon-
structions are then expected to be globally robust to the
methodological details.

A phylogenetic Kalman filter

 

In this simulation experiment, the predictor is assumed to be
known without error for all ancestors along the phylogeny, which
leaves two remaining sources of uncertainty about the estimated
ancestral traits. First, there is only a ﬁnite number of data points
and therefore the regression between the predictor and the trait is
imperfectly estimated. Second, the correlation coefﬁcient is <1,
and therefore, even if the parameters of the regression were per-
fectly known, there would nevertheless be some residual uncer-
tainty about the value of the predicted traits. Both sources of
uncertainty are integrated in the credible intervals produced by
the KalmaniGibbs sampler, as well as by the prediction intervals
constructed by standard linear regression methods, such as im-
plemented in R (R Development Core Team, 2001).

Although, in general, Bayesian credible intervals do not have
exact frequentist coverage for ﬁnite sample size, in the present
case, the average frequentist coverage of the credible intervals re-
turned by the KalmaniGibbs sampler is close to 95% (Table 2).
On the other hand, the disparity observed across individual an-
cestors is larger than expected with an average of 6 of 32 ancestors
displaying a coverage of 92% or less (P< 10’s), and a minimum
observed coverage across all experiments of 87%. The prediction
intervals of the linear regression approach appear to be conserva-
tive, with an average coverage >99%. However, this globally con-
servative behavior hides a large disparity across ancestors, with
individual ancestors displaying a coverage of 92% or less >30% of
the time (i.e. for $10 of the 32 ancestors, Table 2), and a minimum
observed coverage of 75%, thus pointing to underestimation of
the uncertainty associated with speciﬁc nodes along the phyl-
ogeny. Importantly, the prediction intervals returned by the
linear regression method are approximately three times as large
as the credible intervals proposed by the KalmaniGibbs sampler
(Table 2). Excessively large prediction intervals result in low
power when it comes to testing alternative biological hypotheses
(such as deciding between a mesophilic or a thermophilic ancestor
for Archaea, as in the example shown later in the text).

Interestingly, the width of the Bayesian credible intervals de-
pends on the exact position of the ancestral node of interest along
the phylogeny, with nodes that are closer to the tips having nar-
rower credible intervals than nodes closer to the root (Fig. 1B).
This reﬂects the fact that the model-based comparative approach
implemented by the KalmaniGibbs sampler performs a context-
dependent integration of all available sources of information. In
the present case, for recent ancestors, information about the value
of the trait in nearby extant species is combined with the infor-
mation contained in the local value of the molecular predictor,
thus leading to more precise estimates of the trait. In contrast,
information coming from nearby nodes is ignored by the linear
regression method, which therefore tends to yield uniformly wide
conﬁdence intervals over all ancestors, irrespective of their age.

Altogether, compared with a simple linear regression method,
the explicit comparative approach adopted here results in more
accurate reconstructions, combined with a more ﬂexible and
more efﬁcient estimation of the associated uncertainty.

3.3 Application to the reconstruction of ancestral
temperatures in Archaea

The KalmaniGibbs sampler was applied to the reconstruction
of ancestral optimal growth temperatures in Archaea, using a

previously published dataset (Groussin and Gouy, 2011). The
data consist of two alignments, of rRNA stems and of amino
acid recoded protein sequences, for the same set of 33 Archaea
and an outgroup of 12 eubacteria. Using these data, ancestral
compositions at each node of the phylogeny were ﬁrst estimated
using site- and time-heterogeneous models of sequence evolution
and then used, after adequate transformation, as predictors for
reconstructing ancestral growth temperatures (see Section 2).

The reconstruction based on the rRNA dataset (point esti-
mates in Fig. 2, credibility intervals for several key ancestors in
Table 3, line KG—PM) yields a hyperthermophilic ancestor for
Archaea, with an optimal growth temperature of about 1000C
(CI from 9&110). From there, the growth temperature remains
approximately stable, although slightly decreasing, in
Crenarchaea and Koarchaea (the latter represented by
Candidatus), while decreasing down to moderate temperatures
in Thaumarchaea and most Euryarchaea, except in the three
hyperthermophilic species Nanoarchaeum, Thermococcus and
Pyrococcus.

The optimal growth temperature of the ancestor of Archaea is
higher than that of all extant species. In contrast, a reconstruc-
tion using a simple univariate Brownian motion (Supplementary
Fig. S1, Table 3, line BM), thus not integrating information from
the reconstructed evolution of rRNA sequences, results in a non-
hyperthermophilic ancestor, with a growth temperature between
60 and 960C, thus intermediate between the mesophilic and the
hyperthermophilic extant species. This experiment demonstrates
that molecular information can make an important difference for
estimating ancestral traits.

The ancestral reconstruction displayed in Figure 1 is globally
similar to the one previously published (conﬁdence intervals re-
ported in Table 3, line LR+MLBP). Slightly higher temperatures
are obtained here, although with >50% of overlap between the
conﬁdence intervals of the two studies. The correlation between
GC content in rRNA stems and temperature is strong
(R = 0.89), which may explain the robustness of the results.

The results just presented are based on point estimates of an-
cestral compositions, such as obtained from a separate Bayesian
phylogenetic sampler (see Section 2). Therefore, the resulting
credible intervals ignore the uncertainty about ancestral compos-
itions. As a way of including this latter source of uncertainty, a
set of 100 ancestral compositions were drawn from the posterior
distribution under the non-homogeneous phylogenetic model,
and the KalmaniGibbs sampler was separately applied to each
of these 100 datasets. The resulting MCMC samples were pooled
and credible intervals were computed based on this pooled
sample. These credible intervals now combine all sources of
error, caused by the imperfect estimation of ancestral compos-
itions, the incompletely known correlation between GC content
and temperature and the residual error associated with the re-
gression. This two-step approach is not ideal, suffering from a
conceptual incoherence in that ancestral compositions are first
inferred under the prior of the non-homogeneous substitution
model and then assumed to evolve according to a Brownian
prior. Nevertheless, it should work reasonably well in practice,
as long as the prior distributions are sufﬁciently diffused com-
pared with the posterior distribution.

In the present case, the ancestral compositions appear to con-
tribute a small proportion of the total uncertainty (Table 3,

KG+PS), adding ~2OC to the width of intervals that typically
encompass 200C. Therefore, the uncertainty associated with the
ancestral reconstruction is primarily caused by the errors asso-
ciated with the regression, i.e. incompletely known correlation
between temperature and composition, as well as the residual
errors.

The conﬁdence intervals reported in the original analysis of
these data (Groussin and Gouy, 2011, Table 3, LR+MLBP), as
well as in a previous similar work (Boussau et al., 2008; Galtier
et al., 1999), were obtained by bootstrapping the multiple se-
quence alignment. For each bootstrap replicate, ancestral com-
positions were reestimated, followed by a reestimation of the

ancestral temperatures. A conceptual problem with this boot-
strap method is that it results in theoretically vanishing conﬁ-
dence intervals for large alignment, and this, even if the number
of taxa remains constant. Yet, although arbitrarily large align-
ment may result in asymptotically consistent estimates of ances-
tral compositions, if the number of taxa is constant and the
correlation is not perfect, uncertainty about ancestral traits
should normally remain finite, even asymptotically. The uncer-
tainty missed by the bootstrap method is that about the correl-
ation between the trait and the predictor (both the residual error
and the error on the parameters of the regression). This suggests
that, instead of pooling the point estimates obtained over the
bootstrap replicates, one could instead combine the prediction
intervals separately calculated using standard linear regression
methods on each replicate. However, this would result in fairly
large conﬁdence intervals. The prediction intervals based on the
posterior mean ancestral reconstructions (Table 3, LR+ML),
thus not taking into account uncertainty about ancestral com-
positions, already encompass nearly 400C. Combining these
intervals with the bootstrap contribution would amount to a
total uncertainty spanning an interval of ~5(%60"C. In contrast,
the Bayesian method yields intervals spanning ~300C.

The ancestral reconstruction of temperatures obtained with
the protein sequence data (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table
310, KG+PM) is similar to the one obtained using rRNA stem
sequences (Fig. 1 and Table 3). In particular, the archaebacterial
ancestor is again inferred to be hyperthermophilic, although with
a larger uncertainty (between 86 and 1210C). The uncertainty
about ancestral compositions also appears to be larger in the
case of proteins, contributing for an additional 50C of uncer-
tainty about the ancestral temperature (Table 3, KG+PS). The
overall congruence between the two molecular predictors (Fig. 1
and Supplementary Fig. S2), despite the different underlying
data and selective forces, is reassuring. There is a difference
here with the previously published analysis, which tended to
infer a lower ancestral growth temperature for the ancestor of
Archaea with protein data, compared with what was obtained
using the rRNA dataset (Groussin and Gouy, 2011, Table 3,
LR+ML). Reanalyzing the ancestral compositions inferred in
this previous study with the KalmaneGibbs sampler also results
in an lower inferred ancestral growth temperature (Table 3,
KG+ML), thus suggesting that the observed difference is due
to the differing methods used here and in the previous study for
inferring ancestral compositions, and not to the differing
approaches for translating ancestral compositions into optimal
growth temperatures.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this article, a computationally efﬁcient method is introduced
for comparative regression analysis and reconstruction of quan-
titative traits along phylogenies using ancestral information pro-
vided by other traits or molecular sequences. The method fully
accounts for the comparative structure of the problem and inte-
grates the two dimensions over which correlations arise: ﬁrst,
between molecular predictors and the predicted trait, and
second, among ancestors, owing to their shared phylogenetic
ancestry. These two orthogonal dependencies make the problem
equivalent to a hidden Markov model, and the method is thus

A phylogenetic Kalman filter

 

similar to a Kalman ﬁltering approach embedded in a Bayesian
MCMC sampler. The underlying statistical framework is similar
to the one assumed by classical generalized least-square
approaches to this problem (Martins and Hansen, 1997; Pagel,
1999). The main difference is algorithmic, the Kalman filtering
approach having a good overall scaling, in particular with respect
to the number of taxa, for which it is linear.

The derivation conducted here is in terms of an observed pre-
dictor Y conditional on a hidden trait X. Alternatively, and
equivalently in the present case, the problem could have been
more directly formulated as a regression of X onto a non-random
y. Doing so would have the advantage of not making any
assumption about the process followed by Y and would avoid
the inconsistencies created by reconstructing y separately from
the model. On the other hand, it would have a less natural inter-
pretation in terms of the underlying processes. In the present
case, the trait (temperature) inﬂuences the molecular variable
(composition), and therefore a hidden trait model appears to
be more adequate. A hidden trait approach will also more
easily generalize to more complex mechanistic models that
would for instance include some elasticity, and therefore some
delay, in the response of the molecular predictor to changes in
the value of the trait.

Several ancestral reconstructions based on molecular pre-
dictors published thus far have been performed using simple
linear regression methods that do not fully integrate the com-
parative dimension of the question. In practice, the simulations
and the empirical analyses reported here suggest that, although
such simple regression approaches are less principled and less
accurate than explicitly comparative methods, they nevertheless
lead to reasonable point estimation of ancestral traits, at least
when the correlation between the trait and the predictor is
strong. In particular, the present analysis mostly confirms previ-
ous reports about the evolution of growth temperature in
Archaea (Groussin and Gouy, 2011).

A more fundamental weakness of non-comparative
approaches to ancestral reconstructions, however, is that they
do not appear to offer a reasonable measure of statistical conﬁ-
dence. Assessing conﬁdence is often the most problematic ques-
tion in a comparative context, owing to the complex array of
dependencies created by phylogenetic inertia. In such situations,
simple approaches based on classical linear regression will gen-
erally fail to capture the context-dependent modulations of esti-
mation error (as illustrated in Fig. 1B). Alternative methods
based on sampling theory, such as the non-parametric bootstrap
(Efron, 1979), although attractive at ﬁrst sight owing to their
simplicity and their robustness, do not address all sources of
uncertainty. In particular, resampling approaches applied
across sites will not capture the residual error about ancestral
traits even granting perfect knowledge of ancestral proteome
compositions, or the error resulting from the ﬁnite number of
taxa. In the comparative approach, in contrast, the uncertainty
represented in the posterior credible intervals does take into ac-
count both the finite number of independent contrasts and the
residual error of the correlation between the trait and the pre-
dictor. As for the uncertainty about the ancestral compositions,
it is here accounted for only indirectly, via a two-step MCMC
approach.

On the other hand, such a ﬂexible integration of multiple levels
of information comes at a cost: the method, at least in its present
state, is dependent on the Brownian assumption. The Brownian
hypothesis has repeatedly shown to be violated (Lartillot and
Delsuc, 2012; Oakley and Cunningham, 2000). In the present
case, the systematic trend in decreasing growth temperature
observed along the archaeal phylogeny (Fig. 1) is clearly a symp-
tom of a violation of the undirected Brownian assumption.
Apart from systematic trends, punctuated evolution is another
potential violation deserving further consideration. The method
introduced here could easily be adapted so as to include direc-
tional trends in the Brownian process, in a way that would pre-
serve the analytical properties underlying the Kalman filtering
algorithm. More general processes, potentially including jumps
or large deviations (Landis et al., 2013) could also be considered,
although the analytical facilities offered by the multivariate
normal distribution would then most probably be compromised.
More intensive but more general numerical integration methods
would then have to be recruited as an alternative to the Kalman
ﬁlter.

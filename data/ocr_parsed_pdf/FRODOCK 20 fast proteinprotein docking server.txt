Abstract

Summary: The prediction of protein—protein complexes from the structures of unbound compo—
nents is a challenging and powerful strategy to decipher the mechanism of many essential biolo—
gical processes. We present a user—friendly protein—protein docking server based on an improved
version of FRODOCK that includes a complementary knowledge—based potential. The web interface
provides a very effective tool to explore and select protein—protein models and interactively screen
them against experimental distance constraints. The competitive success rates and efficiency
achieved allow the retrieval of reliable potential protein—protein binding conformations that can be
further refined with more computationally demanding strategies.

Availability and Implementation: The server is free and open to all users with no login requirement

1 Introduction

Protein—protein interactions are involved in every cellular process,
and their characterization is therefore critical to understanding the
underlying molecular mechanisms. The computational prediction of
protein—protein complexes from the unbound 3D structures is a suc—
cessful complementary alternative to ongoing structural and prote—
omic endeavors. A great variety of computational ab initio docking
approaches have been developed to predict protein complexes
(Huang, 2014; Ritchie, 2008). These algorithms employ a variety of
efficient search strategies and energy—based scoring strategies, usually
beginning with an exhaustive six—dimensional search to generate
many potential predictions, followed by a detailed and more compu—
tationally demanding refining stage. However, despite the significant
progress in improved scoring functions and the integrative use of bio—
chemical and biophysical information, current algorithms are still lim—
ited. In a recent independent comprehensive assessment of current
exhaustive docking programs (Huang, 2015), the best three docking
approaches succeed in identifying acceptable protein—protein

solutions in 21—3 1, 40—52 and 60—79% of the cases within the top 10
100 and 1000 first solutions, respectively. Our approach, FRODOCK
(Garzon et (11., 2009), which combine 3D grid—based potentials with
the efficiency of spherical harmonics (SH) approximations, ranked
4th of the 18 docking/scoring functions tested. Although its success
rates were slightly lower than the best three methods for the top 10
predictions (19%), FRODOCK yielded competitive success rates of
46 and 76% for the top 100 and 1000 predictions, respectively. In
fact, the authors of this review considered FRODOCK to be a good
docking choice if more predictions can be evaluated, which is often
the case in a post—docking approach. Interestingly, top ranked meth—
ods such as ZODOCK (Pierce et (11., 2014) include knowledge—based
energy terms that FRODOCK lacks. Here, we present a further up—
date of FRODOCK that includes an extra knowledge—based potential.
This new version significantly improves the docking success rate to
the levels of existing state—of—the—art approaches but achieves superior
efficiency. With integration into a new web framework, users
can now predict protein—protein complexes from the unbound

2 Benchmarking and implementation

The docking algorithm is detailed elsewhere (Garzon et (11., 2009).
FRODOCK’s competitive efficiency depends on the spherical har—
monic (SH) formulation to accelerate the rotational part of the
search. Compared with classical 3D grid—based FFT correlation al—
gorithms, the use of SH has proven to be a faster alternative in pro—
tein—protein docking (Ritchie, 2008; Ritchie and Kemp, 2000).
Moreover, linear speed—up is obtained by performing parallel effi—
cient rotational searches of independent docking translational pos—
itions. The original docking fitness score as defined in pyDock
(Cheng et (11., 2007) was approximated as a correlation between soft
van der Waals, electrostatics, and desolvation 3D grid potential
maps conveniently transformed into SH radial (volumetric) repre—
sentations. Here, we improve this scoring function by adding a com—
plementary coarse—grained knowledge—based protein—docking
potential (Tobi, 2010). We employed the ADPs—II atomic potential
variant derived from known protein—protein and decoy (misdocked)
complexes using a linear programming technique. This two—step
contact potential fitted very well to our approximation because of
its efficiency and good performance, as shown in a recent survey of
protein—protein scoring functions (Moal et (11., 2013). To optimize
the relative weights of all potential terms, we followed the same pro—
cedure described in (Garzon et (11., 2009). We also have optimized
the potential weights for the three types of interaction disclosed in
the benchmark (enzyme—substrate, antigen—antibody and others).
However, compared with the addition of the pairwise potential the
gain was quite reduced in terms of docking success (less than 5% in
the best case scenario). The new version, FRODOCK 2.0, obtained
35—45% enhancement in the top rank solution regions using the
standard benchmark 3.0 (results available on the web server).
Results obtained on the 176 targets of the benchmark 4.0 (Hwang
et (11., 2010) confirm the excellent relative docking performance of
FRODOCK 2.0 (see Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S1). The suc—
cess rates to find an acceptable solution based on CAPRI criteria
are 10, 29, 61 and 82% when the top 1, 10, 100 and 1000 predic—
tions are considered, respectively. The accuracy reported for
ZDOCK3.02 in (Huang, 2015), is slightly higher for the top solu—
tions (10 versus 12) but slightly lower if more predictions are con—
sidered (61% versus 52% for the top 100 and 82% versus 79% for
the top 1000). Outside this independent comparison, SwarmDock
(Torchala et (11., 2013) also reported slightly better rates for top so—
lutions with the same benchmark (10, 36 and 65% for the top 1, 10,
100 solutions) but considering additional costly refinement proced—
ures, including rescoring and minimization. It is important to note
that, in contrast with other methods, our success rates include the
docking dependence on the starting orientation as they are com—
puted using 50 runs per case starting from distinct initial relative
orientations. The method is quite robust, and we only found relative
small ranking variations of the best prediction found depending of
the FRODOCK’s docking sensitivity.

two uploaded input protein structures (in PDB format). Alternatively
the user can also select the type of interaction to slightly improve the
docking success rates. In only a few minutes, a results page is shown,
including a graphical interface to interactively explore the predictions
or retrieve the generated models (Fig. 1). The user can inspect and
compare the highly scored poses and visualize docking hot spots.
Moreover, a practical interface is included to add multiple distance
constraints within a user—specified tolerance, providing an effective
way to narrow down the exhaustive docking search. This information
is known to significantly enhance docking success rates and is often
available from various biophysical and biochemical techniques such
as chemical cross—linking, FRET, nuclear or electron magnetic reson—
ances, mass spectrometry, or mutagenesis experiments. Finally, the
server is completed with an extensive gallery of examples including
all the benchmark test cases presented here to illustrate the quality
and limitations of the approach.

One of the major advantages of the server is its efficiency. The
average docking running time for the benchmark 4.0 test cases is
2 min. FRODOCK 2.0 is a faster alternative to state—of—the—art servers
such as ZDOCK (Pierce et (11., 2014) (11 min) or SwarmDock
(Torchala et (11., 2013) (36h) with similar predictive performance.
Moreover, the user can test different constraints and thresholds on the
ﬂy without re—running the docking protocol as in other servers because
the constraint module is implemented as a post—docking procedure.

4 Conclusions

Overall, the server quickly provides reliable potential protein—pro—
tein binding conformations that can be further refined and validated
by more computationally demanding post—docking procedures. The
docking accuracy achieved by adding a complementary knowledge—
based protein—docking potential is comparable to the results of exist—
ing global docking tools but significantly faster. Future develop—
ments include the incorporation of additional experimental
constraints (e.g. low resolution information from electron micros—
copy maps or SAXS) and the integration with docking refinement
tools.

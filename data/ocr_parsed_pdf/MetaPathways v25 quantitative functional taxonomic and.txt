Abstract

Summary: Next—generation sequencing is producing vast amounts of sequence information from
natural and engineered ecosystems. Although this data deluge has an enormous potential to trans—
form our lives, knowledge creation and translation need software applications that scale with
increasing data processing and analysis requirements. Here, we present improvements to
MetaPathways, an annotation and analysis pipeline for environmental sequence information that
expedites this transformation. We specifically address pathway prediction hazards through integra—
tion of a weighted taxonomic distance and enable quantitative comparison of assembled annota—
tions through a normalized read—mapping measure. Additionally, we improve LAST homology
searches through BLAST—equivalent E—values and output formats that are nativer compatible with
prevailing software applications. Finally, an updated graphical user interface allows for keyword
annotation query and projection onto user—defined functional gene hierarchies, including the
Carbohydrate—Active Enzyme database.

Availability and implementation: MetaPathways v2.5 is available on GitHub: http://github.com/hal—
lamlab/metapathways2.

1 Introduction

 

Since the publication of MetaPathways (Konwar et (11., 2013), a
modular annotation and analysis pipeline that enables construction
of environmental pathway/genome databases using Pathway Tools
(Karp et (11., 2002b, 2010) and MetaCyc (Caspi et (11., 2012; Karp
et (11., 2000, 2002a), there have been improvements to the software
via the Knowledge Engine data structure, a graphical user interface
(GUI) for data management and browsing and a master—worker
model for task distribution on grids and clouds (Hanson et (11.,
2014b). Version 2.5 features faster and more accurate quantitative

functional and taxonomic inference. Inspired by the pathway—centric
analysis of the Hawaii—Ocean Time—series (Hanson et 111., 20143), a
weighted taxonomic distance (WTD) has been integrated to detect
taxonomic divergence of predicted MetaCyc pathways. Next, be—
cause it is difficult to determine relative open reading frame (ORF)
abundance in assembled datasets, we adopt reads per kilobase per
million mapped (RPKM) to provide a quantitative measure of se—
quence—coverage on a per—ORF basis (Patil et (11., 2011).
Additionally, the LAST code has been modified to calculate BLAST—
equivalent Bit—score and E—value statistics (Altschul et (11., 1990;

WTD BLAST E-value ORF Count

Fig. 1. Quantitative functional and taxonomic improvements. (a) WTD provides a measure of taxonomic agreement between observed RefSeq Lowest common
ancestor (LCA) taxonomy and the expected taxonomic range of predicted MetaCyc pathways, separated into the ‘High' (Red), ‘Medium' (Orange) and ‘Low'
(Green) taxonomic hazard classes based on negative quartile order statistics. Positive distances represent taxa found within a pathways expected taxonomic
range and so have a hazard class of ‘None' (Grey). (b) The LAST and BLAST homology search algorithms are highly correlated in terms of E-value (R2 : 0.887,
P< 0.01). (c) ORF Count and the RPKM measure show a linear relationship (I?2 : 0.816, P< 0.01). Ninety percent of prediction intervals, displayed as a pair of thin
blue lines about the fitted line, capture ~96.7 and 91.3% of observed points in (b) and (c), respectively. Analysis code can be found in the Supplementary

Kielbasa et al., 2011), producing output files compatible with pre—
vailing software applications, including the MetaGenome ANalyser
(Huson et al., 2007). Finally, query and projection features have
been enhanced with keyword—based searches, with support for
Carbohydrate—Active EnZymes database entries (Cantarel et al.,
2009).

2 Methods

Here, we describe MetaPathways v2.5 improvements in more detail.

2.1 Weighted taxonomic distance

MetaPathways runs the PathoLogic algorithm without taxonomic
pruning, but this omission enables prediction of MetaCyc pathways
outside their expected taxonomic range. WTD serves as a measure
of predicted pathway taxonomic divergence between observed
RefSeq taxonomy and its expected taxonomic range (Hanson et al.,
2014a). Brieﬂy, for each predicted pathway P, WTD D is calculated
on the connecting path P(xexp,xobs) between xobs, the lowest com—
mon ancestor of observed annotations, and each member of its ex—
pected taxonomic range xexp,

where (33,1, is an edge between nodes a and b on the connecting path
Ep(xexpﬁxobs), and d(a) is the depth of node a. (For complete algorithm
details and motivation, see Online Methods and Supplementary
Note S2 of Metabolic pathways for the whole community (Hanson
et al., 2014a)).

2.2 Reads per kilobase per million mapped

Functional analysis of de novo assembled environmental sequence
information is impeded by the lack of quantitative ORF annota—
tions. ORF counts are affected by both sequencing depth and ORF
length, longer ORFs naturally encompass more reads, making quan—
titative comparisons between samples difficult. To resolve this, we
have implemented a bwa—based version of the RPKM (Li and
Durbin, 2010). Intuitively RPKM is a simple proportion of the num—
ber of reads mapped to a sequence section, normalized for sequenc—
ing depth and ORF length:

Reads Mapped to ORF
ORF Length (kb)
Reads Mapped to Sample

2.3 LAST bit—score and E—value

Although both LAST and BLAST are dynamic programming seed—
and—extend approximations to the Smith Waterman algorithm
(Altschul and Erickson, 1986; Smith and Waterman, 1981), in prac—
tice, LAST’s adaptive—seed lengths and simpler code base is 20— to
100—times faster, more accurate and portable. However, LAST
adoption has lagged due to the absence of BLAST—like output format
and statistics. We modified the LAST code to produce the compat—
ible Bit—score and E—value calculations.

3 Results

We benchmarked the implemented improvements described earlier
using Illumina—sequenced marine metagenomic samples. (Joint
Genome Institute: ‘Marine microbial communities from Expanding
Oxygen minimum zones project’ (JGI Project IDs: 4093112,
4093113, 4093125, 4093127—4093132, 4093144—4093149,
4096364—4096371, 4096373, 4096375, 4096377—4096379,
4096381—4096383, 4096385—4096387, 4096389—4096396,
4096398—4096406 and 4096409—4096453)). The WTD distribu—
tion can be used as an informative tool to place pathways into
different taxonomic hazard classes based on their order statistics
(Fig. 1a). Protein annotations of BLAST and LAST are highly corre—
lated in terms of E—value (Fig. 1b), suggesting roughly equivalent re—
sults, but with LAST being significantly faster. Although there is a
positive correlation between RPKM score and ORF count, variance
about the regression line indicates RPKM makes a correction in
many instances (Fig. 1c).

4 Conclusions

MetaPathways v2.5 now addresses quantitative functional and path—
way prediction hazards based on WTD and RPKM calculations, pro—
vides performant LAST output equivalent with BLAST, and more
ﬂexible annotation subsetting and projection via GUI keyword
searches. These improvements enable improved large—scale compara—
tive analysis of next—generation environmental sequence information.

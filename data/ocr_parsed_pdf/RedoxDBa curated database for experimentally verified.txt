ABSTRACT

Summary: Redox regulation and signaling, which are involved in vari-
ous cellular processes, have become one of the research focuses in
the past decade. Cysteine thiol groups are particularly susceptible to
post-translational modification, and their reversible oxidation is of
critical role in redox regulation and signaling. With the tremendous
improvement of techniques, hundreds of redox proteins along with
their redox-sensitive cysteines have been reported, and the number
is still fast growing. However, until now there is no database to ac-
commodate the rapid accumulation of information on protein oxidative
modification. Here we present RedoxDB—a manually curated data-
base for experimentally validated redox proteins. RedoxDB (version
1.0) consists of two datasets (A and B, for proteins with or without
verified modified cysteines, respectively) and includes 2157 redox pro-
teins containing 2203 cysteine residues with oxidative modification.
For each modified cysteine, the exact position, modification type
and flanking sequence are provided. Additional information, including
gene name, organism, sequence, literature references and links to
UniProt and PDB, is also supplied. The database supports several
functions including data search, blast and browsing. Bulk download
of the entire dataset is also available. We expect that RedoxDB will be
useful for both experimental studies and computational analyses of
protein oxidative modification.

1 INTRODUCTION

Oxidative stress represents an imbalance between the reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and a biological system’s ability to detox-
ify the reactive intermediates or to repair the resulting damage.
Many diseases, including type II diabetes, cancer, neurodegen-
erative diseases and cardiovascular disease, are associated with
oxidative stress (Sarsour et al., 2009). ROS has been previously
regarded as unwanted by-products of aerobic metabolism.
However, under normal condition, ROS can regulate the struc-
ture and function of proteins and act as important signaling
molecule in various cellular processes (Imlay, 2003), and many
key cellular processes are indicated to be redox-sensitive. With

the rapid development of ‘redox proteomics’ that enables
high-throughput detection of redox proteins, redox regulation
and signaling have become the research focus in recent years
(Chouchani et al., 2011; Forman et al., 2010).

Cysteine thiol groups are particularly susceptible to oxidation
by ROS, reactive nitrogen species and other electrophilic mol-
ecules. These thiol groups can be reversibly oxidized to intra- and
intermolecular disulﬁde bonds (S-S), sulfenic acid intermediate
(SOH), sulﬁnic acid (SOzH), S-nitrosothiols (S-NO) and
S-glutathione (S-SG). Those oxidative products can be reduced
back by cellular reductants such as thioredoxin (Trx) and gluta-
thione (er) under certain conditions (Meyer et al., 2009; Reddie
and Carroll, 2008). This reversible oxidation plays critical roles in
redox regulation and signaling (Antelmann and Helmann, 2011;
Forman et al., 2010), and represents another common type of
protein post-translational modiﬁcation apart from phosphoryl—
ation (Chiarugi and Buricchi, 2007).

Protein oxidative modiﬁcation events are traditionally identi-
ﬁed by case-by-case studies which usually accompanied by
site-directed mutagenesis experiment. With the development of
proteomics techniques in the past decade, it becomes possible to
identify hundreds of redox-sensitive proteins in one single experi-
ment (Chouchani et al., 2011; Lindahl et al., 2011; Weerapana
et al., 2010). Currently, hundreds of redox proteins have been
identiﬁed, and the number is still fast growing (Chouchani et al.,
2011). For many of these redox proteins, the corresponding cyst-
eines undergoing oxidative modiﬁcation have also been experi-
mentally determined. Meanwhile, several computational studies
for cysteine oxidative modification began to emerge in recent
years (Fomenko et al., 2007; Marine and Gladyshev, 2009;
Sanchez et al., 2008). However, to our knowledge, until now
there is no database to accommodate the rapid accumulation
of information on protein oxidative modiﬁcation.

Here, we describe RedoxDB, a manually curated database of
experimentally veriﬁed protein oxidative modiﬁcation. Annota-
tions are provided at both sequence and residue levels. The data-
base supports several functions including data search, blast,
browsing and bulk download, which enables users to search
and retrieve data easily.

DATABASE CONTENT

RedoxDB (version 1.0) consists of two datasets. Dataset A in-
cludes proteins that the modiﬁed cysteines have been determined
and dataset B includes other redox proteins. All the data are
collected from published literatures and are experimentally ver-
iﬁed by various research groups. These redox proteins are

derived from 123 different species including mammals, plants,
bacteria, Viruses and others.

Annotations at both sequence and residue levels (if available)
are provided. RedoxDB provides annotations including the exact
position, modiﬁcation type and ﬂanking sequence (10 amino
acids) for each modiﬁed cysteine. Additional information, such
as gene name, organism, sequence as well as literature references
with the PubMed links, is supplied. Cross-reference to the
UniProt protein sequence database is also available (Wu et al,
2006). Moreover, links to PDB database are also provided when
the 3D structure data are available (Westbrook et al, 2002).

RedoxDB includes cysteines undergoing different types of oxi-
dative modiﬁcations, such as reversible disulﬁde formation, sul-
phenation, sulphination, S—glutathionylation and S—nitrosylation.
Cysteines that could form reversible disulﬁdes or be S—nitrosylated
constitute the major part of data, as summarized in Table 1.

DATABASE INTERFACE AND TOOLS

RedoxDB is implemented using Apache, MySQL5.0, PHP and
PERL and runs under Ubuntu system. It supports several func-
tions including data searching, browsing and retrieving. Bulk
download of the entire dataset is also amenable.

RedoxDB can be searched using GENENAME, UNIPROT_
ID, PDB_ID or ORGANISM as keywords, and the result can be
ﬁltered by modiﬁcation type and experimental source. The user
can also choose to include dataset B or not. The search output
includes general annotations for all the matched entries
(Fig. 1A). Another page shows the detailed annotation for
each entry (Fig. lBiD). RedoxDB can also be searched by
BLAST function (Altschul et al, 1997) using query sequences.
The output shows general information about blast result and
provides links to the matched entries.

RedoxDB also provides an interface for data browsing. The
number of redox proteins and modiﬁed cysteines are summarized
for each species. Additional links are also provided for retrieving
data by species.

The entire dataset in RedoxDB can be bulk downloaded in
different format. We also welcome scientists in the redox research
community to share their research result Via the database.

DISCUSSION

RedoxDB is the first extensive database that provides
information about protein oxidative modiﬁcation veriﬁed by

experimental studies. RedoxDB not only includes data from
case-by-case studies but also integrates high-throughput data
from proteomics studies. We expect that RedoxDB will be
useful for both experimental studies and computational analyses
of protein oxidative modiﬁcation.

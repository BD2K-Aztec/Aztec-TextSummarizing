ABSTRACT

Motivation: Current computational approaches to function predict-
ion are mostly based on protein sequence classification and transfer
of annotation from known proteins to their closest homologous
sequences relying on the orthology concept of function conservation.
This approach suffers a major weakness: annotation reliability
depends on global sequence similarity to known proteins and is
poorly efficient for enzyme superfamilies that catalyze different
reactions. Structural biology offers a different strategy to overcome
the problem of annotation by adding information about protein
3D structures. This information can be used to identify amino
acids located in active sites, focusing on detection of functional
polymorphisms residues in an enzyme superfamily. Structural
genomics programs are providing more and more novel protein
structures at a high-throughput rate. However, there is still a huge
gap between the number of sequences and available structures.
Computational methods, such as homology modeling provides
reliable approaches to bridge this gap and could be a new precise
tool to annotate protein functions.

Results: Here, we present Active Sites Modeling and Clustering
(ASMC) method, a novel unsupervised method to classify sequences
using structural information of protein pockets. ASMC combines
homology modeling of family members, structural alignment of
modeled active sites and a subsequent hierarchical conceptual
classification. Comparison of profiles obtained from computed
clusters allows the identification of residues correlated to subfamily
function divergence, called specificity determining positions. ASMC
method has been validated on a benchmark of 42 Pfam families for
which previous resolved holo-structures were available. ASMC was
also applied to several families containing known protein structures
and comprehensive functional annotations. We will discuss how
ASMC improves annotation and understanding of protein families
functions by giving some specific illustrative examples on nucleotidyl
cyclases, protein kinases and serine proteases.

1 INTRODUCTION

With the increasing number of genomes and meta-genomes
sequenced, a critical challenge concerns the functional prediction
of proteins encoded by novel predicted genes. Genes and proteins
are commonly classiﬁed in terms of families, subfamilies or super-
families according to different molecular taxonomy (Finn et (11.,
2008; Orengo et (11., 1997; Sonnhammer et (11., 1997).

Clustering methods are aimed at identifying functionally related
proteins and deﬁning thresholds to distinguish truly related proteins
from homologous proteins with different functions. All these
methods rely on the Darwinian evolution concept; protein sequences
are subjected to random mutations and selective pressure adds (or
causes) functional modiﬁcations. The sequence is hence composed
of well conserved positions and others that tolerate mutations,
insertions and deletions. Methods to detect these positions are
based on multiple sequence alignment (MSqu) analysis using
different parameters metrics: chemical properties of residues,
evolution (Kalinina et (11., 2004), quantitative information analysis
(Hannenhalli and Russell, 2000; Sol et (11., 2003), evolutionary-
based analysis (Donaldo and Shakhnovich, 2005, 2009; Pei et (11.,
2006), phylogeny-independent methods (Pazos et (11., 2006) or
combination of properties (Chakrabarti et (11., 2007). For a few
years, new methods have been proposed to include structural
information for enhancing the quality of amino acids function
prediction (Gong and Blundell, 2008; Goldenberg et (11., 2009;
Henschel et (11., 2007; Kalinina et (11., 2009; Langraf et (11.,
2001; Najmanovich et (11., 2008; Pupko et (11., 2002). Capra and
Singh (2008); Kristensen et (11. (2008); Lichtarge et (11. (1996);
Madabushi et (11. (2002); Redfem et (11. (2009); Ward et (11.
(2009) proposed an evolutionary trace (ET) procedure to predict
active sites and functional interfaces in proteins with known
structure.

In this work, we propose ASMC, a novel methodology
for unsupervised classiﬁcation of protein subfamilies allowing
functional and speciﬁcity determining positions (SDPs) detection.
According to Rausell et (11. (2010), SDPs are related to fundamental
regions that correspond to ligand binding and protein interaction
sites. Methods developed to detect SDPs are based on multiple
sequence alignments and we propose with ASMC to improve
the detection by using structural alignments of active site

residues. While 3D structural information gives valuable insights
to understand the molecular function of proteins, there is still a
small fraction of experimentally solved structures in comparison
with the amount of sequences. In this context, homology modeling
provides structural information for the members of a protein family,
using one or more templates (Moult, 2005; Tramontano and Morea,
2003; Yu et (11., 2005). Different methodologies have been developed
to improve protein annotation of protein speciﬁcity using 3D
information (Chakrabarti and Panchenko, 2009; Halabi et (11., 2009;
Nagao et (11., 2010; Rottig et (11., 2010; Tseng et (11., 2009).

ASMC is phylogeny independent and relies on (i) an improved
alignment of speciﬁc active site cavities based on 3D protein
structure alignment and (ii) a classiﬁcation of these alignments based
on information theory. Each classiﬁed cluster is deﬁned by a unique
proﬁle. Comparison of these proﬁles pinpoints SDPs correlated with
functional intra-family diversiﬁcation.

To test our method, we used a benchmark dataset deﬁned
by Kalinina et (11. (2009) composed of 42 Pfam families. The
dataset is divided into two classes of enzymes depending on
their mono or multi-functional character [more than one enzyme
classiﬁcation (EC) number]. Sensitivity (Se) and speciﬁcity (Sp)
obtained for multi-functional (Se=47%, Sp=68%) and mono-
activity (Se=72%, Sp=37%) families demonstrate the reliability
of ASMC predictions.

Detailed analysis of three well-known families conﬁrmed the
accuracy of SDP prediction by providing molecular explanation for
identiﬁed SDPs residues.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Data selection

The test set benchmark was extracted as described in Kalinina et a1. (2009)
(Pfam families are listed in Supplementary Material). The set is composed of
enzymes families with well-characterized functions and at least one structure
with bound natural ligands available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). One
part of the dataset is composed of protein families acting on a variety of
substrates (diverse dataset), whereas the second set is composed of mono-
actiVity protein families. With respect to the original set, two families were
deleted: (i) PFOO896 is a ‘dead’ Pfam family and has been removed from
the database, (ii) in PFO3061, no pocket corresponding to active sites was
detected.

Protein sequences were selected from the Pfam database (Finn at (11.,
2008) and length and identity ﬁlters were applied to remove sequences with
lengths differing by more than one SD from the family average length or
sequences with less than 30% similarity to one of the template structures.
PDB identiﬁers for the templates were extracted from the same database.

Nucleotidyl cyclases: we selected 2201 sequences from PFOO211. This set
presented sequences of 199. 80 :I:70. 13 residues and after selection by size we
retained 1646 sequences of 187.25 :I: 14.44 residues. We used one template
for guanylate cyclases (PDB idzchain, 3ET6:A), one for adenylate cyclases
(1AB8:A) and we analyzed 536 sequences with more than 30% identity to
these templates. These 536 sequences have 41.18 :I:7.61% sequence identity
with their template sequences.

Protein kinases: we selected 33 665 sequences from Pfam families
PF00069 and PF07714 (protein lengths: 219.36:I: 81.09 residues). A total
of 3403 sequences were selected by the length and identity different
ﬁlters (templates used 2CPK:E for serine/threonine kinase and 1U46:A for
tyrosine kinase). The average sequence identity with the templates was
35.96:I:7.49%.

Serine proteases: we selected 7256 sequences from PFOOO89
(193.82 :I:57.23 residues) and kept 6016 after ﬁltering by size

5PTP:A for trypsin and 1AB9: (we joined chains A, B, C and D to form
one chain) for chymotrypsin. The retained 1686 serine proteases with more
than 30% identity with the templates have an average identity with them of
39.04 :I: 10.08%.

2.2 ASMC methodology

The different steps of the ASMC method are summarized in Figure 1.

Modeling: homology models using multiple templates are constructed
using Modeller version 9V6 (Eswar at (11., 2008). Prior, for each family, a
‘structure proﬁle” was built with a multiple structure alignment using the
SALIGN module (Madhusudhan at (11., 2009).

For each sequence, we built 50 models and the best model was selected
as the one with the lowest objective function. This function corresponds to
the total energy of the system, based on CHARMM all atom potential, and
indicates a model with the best ﬁt with the input data (inter-residue distances
and residue dihedral angles, i.e. stereochemical constraints).

Pocket prediction and selection: detection of pockets was performed on
a reference structure, chosen as the holo form structure if exists or an apo
form with crystallographic structure with the best resolution. Cavities are
computed using Fpocket software (Le Guilloux at (11., 2009), based on
the theory of alpha-shapes, Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulation.
Fpocket ranks cavities as the most probable active site. Nevertheless, we have
chosen to perform our ASMC over all predicted pockets. We present results
for the most conserved pockets, which turned out to be the enzyme active
site. In majority of the cases, the ﬁrst ranked cavity by Fpocket software was

Identification of subfamily-specific sites

 

the enzyme active site, except for families PFOO278, PF01227, PF01583,
PF02901 and PF03414.

Structural 3D alignment: the alignment of pocket residues were obtained
using MultiProt software (Shatsky et (11., 2004). Results of the multiple
structure alignment of modeled pockets were compiled to build a multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) where each residue of the modeled pockets is
positioned relatively to the reference structure.

Clustering: selected residues of catalytic pockets identiﬁed by the 3D
alignment are used as the support to separate subfamilies by a conceptual
clustering approach (Fisher, 1987) . This approach creates a hierarchical
categorization of the instances (protein pockets), generating a conceptual
description for each class in which concepts are sets of residues responsible
for functional differentiation in a protein family. The algorithm, COBWEB
(Fisher, 1987) was run using WEKA software (Holmes at (11., 1994) and the
following parameters: C = 0.25, A: 1.0.

Statistical signiﬁcance: a log-likelihood analysis (Pei et (11., 2006) is
computed for each MSA position. This procedure is a test based on the ratio
between the probabilities of two different hypotheses. For each position i of
the MSA, the frequency of the most frequent residue in a speciﬁc cluster
is computed both for the individual cluster and all the others merged. The
null hypothesis states that the most frequent residue is found with similar
frequencies in the cluster and elsewhere so that it is not important for the
speciﬁcity. The alternative hypothesis states the opposite. The log-likelihood
analysis states on the speciﬁcity signiﬁcation (the null hypothesis tends to
be rejected with high values). The log-likehood 10g(L,») is approximated as:

a b
log(Li)%2|:alog<W)+blog<m):| (1)
(c-l—d) (bl—d)

where (1 corresponds to the number of times that we ﬁnd the most frequent
residue in position i in a speciﬁc cluster, I) is the frequency of this residue in
the other clusters, 0 is the number of sequences in the speciﬁc cluster and d
is the number of sequences in the other clusters.

Residues are shufﬂed at all positions of the MSA and a new log-likelihood
is computed. We perform 100 simulations and consider the average value for
the log-likelihood computation. Thus,

10g(Li)

LLR~ = — 2
l < log(L;‘h) > ( )

 

 

where L, is the log-likelihood for the original residues of the position i and
<L‘17h >, the average log-likelihood for the 100 shufﬂe observations.

To obtain a signiﬁcant scoring function tracking the relevant speciﬁc
residues, ASMC constructs a random model based on the frequencies of
amino acids at each position. This randomization uses the Whelan and
Goldman (WAG) substitution matrix (Whelan and Goldman, 2001). For
this second step, 1000 simulations are performed by shufﬂing the original
residues at each position, allowing them to mutate according to substitution
probabilities. The LLRf’" is computed for each simulation and the Z-score
is obtained as follows (P-Value is deduced from Z-score):

LLR, — < LLRgi'" >

Z -score = .
a(LLRf"")

(3)

SDPs/CPs/OPs categories: For each family, SDPs are identiﬁed as the
residues with P<1e-4 and conserved positions (CPs) as residues with
conservation >75%. Remaining amino acids from the pocket list are labeled
other positions (OPs).

2.3 ASMC validation on the benchmark

In order to evaluate the performances of ASMC, we set up different criteria:

Average distance: SDPs, CPs and OPs residues have been positioned onto
the crystal structure bound to the ligand(s). For each category, the average
distance between residues and the ligand(s) is computed as described in
Kalinina et a1. (2009). The average distance is deﬁned as the sum of the
minimal distances between residues and ligands divided by the number of

residues. The minimal distance is the distance between the closest atoms
of one residue and the ligand(s). As OPs residues are not supposed to
be catalytic, functional or binding residues, it is expected to have longer
distances for OPs than for CPS or SDPs residues.

Sensitivity (Se) and speciﬁcity (Sp): the set of residues in contact with
ligand(s) has been extracted from the holo structure and are deﬁned as
positives residues (i.e. functional residues). The remaining residues are
deﬁned as negatives. We considered that a residue is in contact with the
ligand when its minimal distance is smaller than 5 A. Se is the ratio of true
positives (CPs or SDPs) to true positives plus false negatives. Sp is the ratio
of true negatives to true negatives plus false positives.

2.4 Comparison with multiple sequence alignments

In order to measure precisely the inﬂuence of homology modeling on SPDs
detection, we performed a similar ASMC pipeline but changing the structural
alignment step by a multiple sequence alignment for the 42 families of
our benchmark. The multiple sequence alignment was performed using
MAFFT (Katoh at (11., 2005) and the following steps (identiﬁcation of
residues of active site and classiﬁcation) were applied as described in ASMC
methodology.

3 RESULTS

3.1 ASMC performance

Sensitivity and speciﬁcity of ASMC: for each family, ASMC
sensitivity and speciﬁcity was calculated and the average distances
between SDPs + CPs and OPs with the ligands have been computed
as described in Section 2 (Fig. 2). For some families, two results
(family-1/—2) are presented when two ligands are bound to the
enzyme in different pockets. Over the 47 studied pockets (42
families, 5 with two pockets), ASMC predicted 47% (Se > 47%)
of the residues in contact with ligands. We observed signiﬁcant
difference between results obtained on uni-functional (Se=72%,
Sp: 37%) and multi-functional families (Se=47%, Sp: 68%). As
we compared our predictions to one holo structure bound to a unique
ligand, we only used residues interacting with a single ligand. For
the diverse dataset, we did not include potential residues binding
different substrates. This bias introduced an underestimation of
sensitivity/speciﬁcity and underlines that ASMC can perform better
on multiactivities families than indicated in this study.

In families PF00108, PF01293 and PF02901, ASMC does not
identify OP residues and seems to overpredict CP residues which
are not in contact with the ligands. These residues may be important
for the structural organization or stability of the pocket. However,
a detailed analysis of these cases conﬁrmed that all SDPs are
in contact with the ligand. In other families (PF00293, PF00755,
PF01135, PF01467 and PF03171), the observed weak sensitivity
is explained by the weak sequence identity between members of
the family (<30%). This reveals one limit of the method to analyze
poorly conserved super-family not allowing reasonable structural
alignments.

Comparison of clusters with EC classiﬁcation: in order to test the
relevance of ASMC clustering, we checked the coherence of clusters
using experimentally proven EC numbers. Seventy percent of the
clusters are in agreement with the EC number classiﬁcation, each
EC number segregating the clusters. In Supplementary Figure S 1, we
give an example of classiﬁcation obtained with ASMC for PF02274
Pfam family. ASMC has separated two main clusters with very
distinct activities (EC 2.1.4.; aminidotransferases and EC 3.5.3.6;

Fig. 2. ASMC results over mono- and multifunctional families. On top, ASMC performance is described in terms of Speciﬁcity and Sensitivity (see Section 2).
Below, average distance to bound ligand(s) is compared between CPs + SDPs categories, predicted to be functional residues, and OPs categories, the remaining
residues. For some families, two results (family-1/-2) are presented when two ligands are bound to the enzyme in different pockets.

arginine deiminase) while Pfam classiﬁcation has grouped them. In
the remaining 30%, enzymes can manifest inﬁdelity of molecular
recognition. Many enzymes can promiscuously catalyze reactions
or act on substrates, other than those for which they evolved
(Khersonsky and Tawﬁk, 2010). This could be the case for enzymes
belonging to families PF00128, PF01112, PF01135 and PF01712.
For PF00128, as underlined by Kalinina et (11. (2009), the same
enzymatic activity seems to have evolved independently on two
separate branches of the phylogenetic tree. For PF01112, ASMC
was not able to separate B-aspartyl—peptidase (EC 3.5.1.26) and
aspartylglucosylarninase (EC 3.4.19.5) activities. For PF01135,
ASMC has mixed N -acetylglucosamine—6-phosphate deacetylase
(EC 3.5.1.25) and N4-(B-N-acetylglucosaminyl) - L - asparaginase
(EC 3.5.1.26), which are very promiscuous reactions. In PF01712,
ASMC has been able to separate pyrimidine and purine kinases, but
was enable to discriminate guanosine to adenosine, and cytidine to
thymidine speciﬁcities .

Inﬂuence of sequence similarity on ASMC: one of the factors that
inﬂuences the quality of models predicted by homology modeling is
the sequence identity between the target sequence to be modeled, and
the reference one (associated to a structure). It has been shown that
models obtained for a similarity greater that 30% have, on average,
more than 60% of the backbone atoms correctly modeled and a root
mean squared deviation (RMSD) less than 3.5 A(Eswar et (11., 2008).
The efﬁciency decreases below the 30% threshold, which deﬁnes
the upper bond of the twilight zone. Supplementary Figure S2
presents the evolution of Se and Sp depending on sequence similarity
obtained for the 42 benchmark families. It spotlights that detection of
SDPs is more efﬁcient with dataset composed of divergent sequences

(increase of speciﬁcity). Also, this analysis underlines that ASMC
is still efﬁcient below the 30% threshold, a compromise to obtain
good Sp and Se.

Average distance of CPs+SDPs to cognate ligand onto related
family members crystal structure: for 85% of the cases, average
distance between CPs + SDPs and ligands is smaller than distance
between ODPs and ligands, showing that ASMC recovers most
functional residues. These distances have been compared with
results obtained by SDPsite (Kalinina et (11., 2009) for CPS + SDPS.
For 80% of the cases, ASMC performed better (see Supplementary
Material for detailed results on 42 families).

3.2 Alignment improvement

In this study, target sequences were aligned with template structures
using the SALIGN module of Modeler (Madhusudhan et (11., 2009).
Structural alignment differs from sequence alignment methods as
it takes into account structural information from the template.
This information is used to introduce a gap penalty function that
tends to place gaps in exposed solvent and curved regions, outside
secondary structure segments, and between stericaly inconsistent
positions. The alignment error rate is reduced by 1/3 relatively to
standard sequence alignment and this improvement is enhanced as
the similarity between the sequences decreases (Eswar et (11., 2006).
To optimize the alignment process (Chakravarty et (11., 2008), We
computed 50 models, for each sequence, using all the structures
available for a family (Eswar et (11., 2008).

The impact of alignment quality of ASMC over classical sequence
global multi-alignment is illustrated in Figure 3. Assuming that the

Fig. 3. Divergence in residue positions in sequence alignment (MSqu)
and structural alignment (MSA). A total of 2201 sequences from family
Pfam PF00211 (nucleotidyl cyclases) were aligned using clustalW, and by
the structural alignment used in ASMC. The curve presents the deviation
average between the methods for all the proteins of the family. Dots show
the positions of residues in the multiple sequence alignment that correspond
to the active site residues according to Fpocket prediction (Le Guilloux
et (11., 2009). For more clarity, they have been placed on top of the error
bar. For instance, position 938 is mismatching in 200 sequences resulted of
the MSqu. This result highlights the impact of structural information on
alignment quality, correcting cumulative sequence alignment errors due to
insertion/deletion misplacements (x-axis: MSqu positions; y-axis: number
of sequences that present divergent alignment between the two alignments).

structural alignment is ideal, we computed the deviation between
residue positions in an MSqu and the position obtained by
structural alignment. We can note that the cumulative error rate
in sequence-based comparison, along the sequence, is corrected by
the structural alignment. The highest alignment quality for residues
in the catalytic cavity illustrates the sensibility of sequence-based
alignment to sequence conservation (residues in active site regions
are usually more conserved). The curve presents the averages
between all proteins of the family and shows errors in the MSqu
due to insertions and/or deletions. This result highlights the impact
of structural information on sequence alignment quality.

Supplementary Table S4 compares Se and Sp obtained with
ASMC and with a modiﬁed version procedure in which alignment
has been replaced by multiple sequence alignment (MSqu) (see
Sections 2 and 2.4). ASMC performs better (Sp: 52.5%;
Se: 59.5%) than the multiple sequence alignment (Sp:41%;
Se : 56%). Using MSqu, sequences of families PF00693, PF01135
and PF01234 could not be clustered.

3.3 Nucleotidylcyclases

Nucleotidyl cyclases are enzymes that catalyze the formation of
cyclic nucleotide monophosphate from nucleotide triphosphate. The
guanylate cyclase (GC) group catalyzes the formation of CGMP from
GTP and the adenylate cyclase (AC) group converts ATP to CAMP.
As shown by Tucker et (11. (1998), the speciﬁcity of GC can be
modiﬁed to AC by two amino acid substitutions of guanylate cyclase
(PDB ID 3ET6:A): Glu523Lys and Cys592Asp. The Cys592Asp
mutation abolishes guanidine binding by creating an electrostatic

Fig. 4. Analysis of the active site pocket residues of (a) guanylate cyclases
and (b) adenylate cyclases. Sequence logos were generated using WebLogo
(Crooks at (11., 2004). For each position of the catalytic pocket 3D alignment
(Section 2) supporting the classiﬁcation method, representation of the
observed frequency of residues is encoded by the height of the letter. The
overall height of each stack is proportional to the sequence conservation at
that position. The letters in each stack are ordered from the most to the least
frequent so that one may read the consensus sequence from the tops of the
stacks. P-Values are computed as described in Section 2. Positions of amino

families: Arg590, Leu593 and Phe594 in GC and their counterparts
in AC (Gln, Ile and Trp). Mutagenesis experiments could not identify
the roles of these three amino acids in substrate speciﬁcity.

ASMC, applied to 536 sequences (Section 2), detects two clusters
in the ﬁrst tree ramiﬁcations: one is composed of 323 GC sequences
and the other is composed of the 213 AC sequences (Fig. 4).
It detects conserved residues (highest P-value) implied in activity or
structure integrity: Phe480, Phe486, Leu502, Asp527 and Gly595.
The positions known to be involved in speciﬁcity are detected as
SDPs (lowest P-value): the Glu523/Lys938 position and the position
Cys592 which is substituted by a negative residue at position 1018
in the AC group.

Results were compared with the TreeDet method that identiﬁes
six clusters. The main one is composed of 19% of the sequences
(mainly but not only of GC), and the second one includes 12% of
the sequences (mainly but not only AC). The remaining sequences
(69%) are divided between four clusters. Eighteen determinant
positions are predicted (Gln880, Tyr882, Ala890, Leu912, Ile919,
Val934, Glu935, Ile937, Lys938, Va11009, Lys1014, Tyr1017,
Asp1018, Ile1019, Trp1020, Va11024, Phe1074 and Va11075). Only
one of the two experimentally validated residues (Asp1018) was
detected with a poor conservation rate. In this example, ASMC
performed better for subfamily division and SDP prediction. One
should note that the TreeDet analysis combines both the MSqu
building (ClustalW slow/accurate alignment) and the method itself.

Results were also compared with the method proposed by
Hannenhalli and Russell (2000). This method requires pre-deﬁnition
of clusters and we use those predicted by ASMC as input to
the program. We obtained seven SDPs covering the two known
positions, the Ile937, Ile1019 and Trp1020 positions that are also
involved with speciﬁcity. For the two additional predicted positions

3.4 Protein kinases

Protein kinases are a family of enzymes that transfer phosphates
from nucleotide triphosphates (usually ATP) to proteins (Hanks
et (11., 1988). Two broad classes have been characterized with
respect to substrate speciﬁcity: tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine
kinases.

The two classes are characterized by two consensus sequences,
RDLKPEN present in serine/threonine kinases and RDLAARN in
tyrosine kinases. Figure 5 shows the active site pocket residue
composition in each subfamily found by our method. The mentioned
patterns are well identiﬁed and, according to the review presented
in Hanks et (11. (1988), predicted CPs (Lys72, Glu91, Arg165, Asp
166, Gln171, Asp184 and Phe185) are all involved with catalytic
activities of both the two families. The three discriminating amino
acids in patterns are the three residues scored with the lowest
P-value: Ala254, Ala255 and Arg256 for the tyrosine kinases and
Lys168, Prol69, Glu170 for the serine/threonine kinases. These
residues are known to be involved in the differentiation of substrate
speciﬁcity. Other residues have been described as determining
speciﬁcity (Hannenhalli and Russell, 2000). The Thr201 and Ter4
residues are close to the P+ 1 recognition loop identiﬁed by Hanks
et (11. (1988). In this study, we focused the analysis on residues of the
active site pocket and we did not extend the analysis to the P + 1 loop.
A third group composed of 237 sequences, deﬁned by a very well
conserved pattern of residues, has also been identiﬁed by ASMC.
Annotation of sequences identiﬁed them as epidermal growth factor
receptors (EGFR). In our classiﬁcation, it appears as subfamily of
the tyrosine kinases.

3.5 Serine proteases

Serine proteases are proteolytic enzymes involving a catalytic triad
composed of a nucleophile serine, an electrophile aspartate and an

histidine as a base. Trypsins hydrolyze peptides harboring arginine
or lysine at P1 position, chymotrypsins act on large hydrophobic
residues at this position and elastases act on small aliphatic residues.
This substrate speciﬁcity is associated with structural changes in
the S1 binding pockets: The trypsin Asp189 residue accounts for
the preference for positive residues. The hydrophobic property in
chymotrypsin is due to a modiﬁcation of the aspartate to a serine
residue. In elastases, the pocket is occluded by Val216 and Thr226
(both positions are occupied by a conserved glycine residue in
trypsins and in chymotrypsins), that accounts for the preference
for small aliphatic residues. ASMC separates trypsin, chymotrypsin
and elastase subfamilies (Fig. 6). The lowest P-value position
in the trypsin subfamily is Asp189 that is involved in Arg/Lys
tropism at P1 position. This single position frilly explains the
trypsin speciﬁcity when compared with the other two families. This
position is changed to serine for chymotrypsins and elastases with
low P-values. The other known catalytic positions 216 (glycine)
and 226 (glycine) are coherently scored with high P-values in the
trypsin subfamily as they are determinant for chymotrypsin and
elastase activity. Val216 and Thr216 residues may be substituted
by glycine or serine in the elastase group. All sequences of this
group are annotated as elastase by SwissProt / UniProt and our
method did not identify a subgroup speciﬁc for these variations;
these observations suggest that these changes do not modify the
elastase speciﬁcity.

The Tyr172Trp position, which presents a low P-values in
chymotrypsins and also elastases, has been described as determinant
in the trypsin/chimotrypsin conversion (Hedstrom et (11., 1994).The
TreeDet (ClustalW) method predicts the following discriminating
residues: Trp51, His91 and Leu155 which do not include the
four found to be determinant (172, 189, 216 and 226). The
method of Hannenhalli and Russell (2000) detects the positions
189 and 226 but not 216 and 172, discriminating between
trypsins and chymotrypsins. Positions 121, 137 and 164 are
also detected and we have no experimental data on these
residues.

In addition to the predicted trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase
subfamilies, ASMC identiﬁes a 13 sequence cluster associated with
a conserved SDP pattern (Fig. 7). This cluster is composed of
sequences annotated as kallikreins, for which we did not use 3D
structure information for protein modeling. This result illustrates

4 CONCLUSION

While quantities of sequence and structural data continue to grow,
only a few methods are using these two kinds of information to
annotate proteins at a high-throughput rate. Our method, ASMC,
proposes a new approach to the annotation of enzymes with a high
level of precision. Indeed, prediction of SDPs in active site provides
information for understanding protein functions and evolution. The
main advantage of ASMC over existing methods is the structural
alignment of pockets that provides a high-quality comparison of
residues located in the active site. Comparison of the method
with a multiple sequence alignment-based methods demonstrated
the limitation of using only the sequence information, due to the
low quality of sequence alignments. The conceptual clustering step
separates the subfamilies and determines the residues responsible for
the speciﬁcity. The methodology has been validated with families
of known functions and predicted SDPs are well conﬁrmed by
experimental data.

We identiﬁed several applications of patterns proposed by ASMC.
CPs and SDPs positions outline residues of active site pockets that
are under selective constraint, conserved or correlated to subfamily
differentiation. These residues, used as a geometric pattern, can be
used for screening structure databases to identify new candidates
for speciﬁc functions. ASMC can also be used to classify new
sequences, belonging to families with at least one structure available,
in order to annotate them into functional subfamilies.

Although we presented results for known protein families, the
method can provide valuable insights in the study of families
with unknown functions and can serve as an input to elucidate
new enzymatic activities. This is a real challenge as 3000 above
11912 families of the database of sequences families (Pfam-A)
are referred to domains of unknown functions (DUFs). Among
them, about 250 families have at least one structure deposited

in PDB. ASMC can be used by screening and searching for
homologous patterns in an active site proﬁle database associated
to an enzymatic activity. Another interesting perspective of ASMC
patterns is the improvement of de novo function prediction through
virtual screening approaches. SDPs and CPs can be used to improve
selection of plausible conﬁgurations of substrates in the active sites
by pinpointing important substrate/enzyme interactions.

ABSTRACT

Summary: SensSB (Sensitivity Analysis for Systems Biology)
is an easy to use, MATLAB-based software toolbox, which
integrates several local and global sensitivity methods that can
be applied to a wide variety of biological models. In addition
to addressing the sensitivity analysis problem, SensSB aims to
cover all the steps involved during the modeling process. The
main features of SensSB are: (i) derivative and variance-based
global sensitivity analysis, (ii) pseudo-global identifiability analysis,
(iii) optimal experimental design (OED) based on global sensitivities,
(iv) robust parameter estimation, (v) local sensitivity and identifiability
analysis, (vi) confidence intervals of the estimated parameters
and (vii) OED based on the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM).
SensSB is also able to import models in the Systems Biology
Mark-up Language (SBML) format. Several examples from simple
analytical functions to more complex biological pathways have been
implemented and can be downloaded together with the toolbox. The
importance of using sensitivity analysis techniques for identifying
unessential parameters and designing new experiments is quantified
by increased identifiability metrics of the models and decreased
confidence intervals of the estimated parameters.

Availability: SensSB is a software toolbox freely downloadable from
http://www.iim.csic.es/~gingproc/SensSB.html. The web site also
contains several examples and an extensive documentation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sensitivity analysis (SA) is receiving an increasing attention in the
ﬁeld of Systems Biology (Sahle et al., 2008) and several tools have
been developed, namely SBML-SAT (Zi et al., 2008), PottersWheel
(Maiwald and Timmer, 2008), and Systems Biology Toolbox 2
(Schmidt and Jirstrand, 2006). However, neglecting any of the steps
of the model building cycle as considered in the area of systems
identiﬁcation (Walter and Pronzato, 1997) can lead to wrong models
or models with a low predictive capacity. That is why, in SensSB, the
use of global optimization methods for parameter estimation (PE)
and optimal experimental design (OED) has been coupled with other
computational procedures based on SA for Checking identiﬁability
and other related measures. Another additional advantage is that

the toolbox is able to handle deterministic non-linear dynamic
models described by sets of ordinary differential equations (ODEs),
differential algebraic equations (DAEs) or even black boxes.

Model building can be regarded as a cycle: starting from a goal
deﬁnition (purpose of the model) and some a priori knowledge
(e.g. preliminary data and initial hypothesis), a model framework
is Chosen and a model structure (system of equations) is proposed.
The validity of this structure should be tested by means of an
identiﬁability analysis (Srinath and Gunawan, 2010), e.g. making
use of SA tools that can help to identify critical and negligible
parameters and to establish a parameter ranking. If experimental
data are available, PE is then carried out, leading to a ﬁrst model.
Otherwise a set of experiments must be designed and performed
before the PE. The quality of these estimators should be assessed
by Checking the correlation between them and computing their
conﬁdence intervals. This initial model must be validated with
new experiments, which in most cases will reveal a number of
deﬁciencies. Thus, a new model structure and/or a new experimental
design must be planned, and the process is repeated iteratively until
the validation step is considered satisfactory.

All these tasks were implemented in MATLAB, generating
gateways for calling external Fortran codes when needed. These
Fortran codes were implemented as MATLAB MEX-ﬁles leading to
an integrated environment able to perform robust PE, identiﬁability
analysis and OED of dynamic experiments. Moreover, SensSB
includes a novel methodology for performing OED based on global
sensitivities with a great potential on the Systems Biology ﬁeld
where experiments can be very expensive and time consuming. In
order to make the problem implementation easier, SensSB includes
a user-friendly graphical interface where the model and other inputs
(e. g. initial values, measurement times, control variables, etc.) can be
speciﬁed. The MATLAB GUI (Graphical User Interface) generates
an input ﬁle that SensSB uses for performing all the requested tasks
as detailed below. Results are displayed on the screen and saved as
an output ﬁle together with several graphic ﬁles.

2 SENSSB FEATURES

The main features of SensSB environment are depicted in Figure 1
and can be summarized as follows:

(i) Global sensitivity analysis (GSA): before any experimental
data are obtained, a parameter ranking based on GSA provides
insight about the model identiﬁability (Saltelli et al., 2008).
Negligible parameters (those with relatively low sensitivity
measures) can be discarded from the model or ﬁxed to
literature values while special attention should be paid to the

highest ranked ones. It can also be used to identify the critical
regions of the system and the most relevant state variables.
By observation of the dynamics of the global sensitivities
(also plotted by SensSB), the time span required for future
experiments can be envisaged. Three GSA methods can be
selected in SensSB: Sobol’ indices, derivative-based global
sensitivity measures (DGSM) and Morris indices.

(ii) Pseudo-Global a priori identiﬁability analysis: the
computation of a pseudo-global correlation matrix based
on simulated data is useﬁil to identify highly correlated or
redundant parameters that can be removed from the model
with a minimum loss of information. Another matrix with the
standard deviation of the correlations is also provided, giving
information about the consistency of these correlations along
the parameter space.

(iii) OED based on GSA: OED aims to identify the conditions
and sampling schemes for a set of experiments that deliver
data providing the maximum information with respect to the
parameter identiﬁability and their estimation accuracy. No PE
can be carried out before experimental data are collected,
therefore, an OED based on local sensitivities has to be
based on literature values for the parameters. Relying on
these values can be misleading and so a GSA-based OED,
consisting on averaging the selected scalar ﬁinction of the
Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) over the parameter space, is
recommended. The features of the dynamic experiments that
can be optimized through SensSB are: (i) initial concentration
of the states, (ii) duration of the experiments, (iii) values for the
control variables and their switching points and (vi) sampling
points (i.e. when to measure the output variables).

(iv) Robust PE: once experiments are performed and data are
collected, the aim of PE is to calibrate the model in order
to ﬁt the experimental data in the most accurate way. SensSB
offers several global and local optimization methods that are
able to handle noisy and partial measurements. Three global
algorithms (SSm, DE, SRES) and two local ones (fmincon,
fminsearch) can be selected. We strongly recommend the
use of 88m as it has shown good efﬁciency and robustness in a
wide number of benchmark problems (Rodriguez-Fernandez
et al., 2006). Depending on the information about the error
of the experimental data, different objective functions can be

selected, namely least squares, weighted least squares and
maximum likelihood.

(v) Local sensitivity and identiﬁability analysis: after a ﬁrst set
of parameters has been identiﬁed, the computation of the
parametric sensitivities, the FIM, its condition number and the
correlation matrix is advisable. Particularly, for cases where
the correlations are not very consistent along the parameter
domain, this a posteriori local identiﬁability analysis will
provide more precise information than the pseudo-global
approach, always with the drawback of being only applicable
to a speciﬁc set of parameters.

(vi) Conﬁdence intervals: the computation of the 95% conﬁdence
intervals by means of the Cramer-Rao method or the bootstrap
approach offers an objective measure of the precision of the
estimated parameters.

(vii) OED based on local SA: although a good option when the
value of the parameters is unknown, OED based on GSA can
be statistically pessimistic (considering sets of parameters that
are unlikely to ﬁt the data). Therefore, when the vicinity of
the global optimum for the parameters has been found, local
OED is preferred. Scalar functions of the FIM measuring the
accuracy and/or decorrelation of the parameters are used as
criteria.

An exhaustive description of the methodologies implemented in
SensSB can be found in the software documentation.

3 CONCLUSONS

The user-friendly interface together with the wide range of
capabilities and the detailed documentation make SensSB ideal
for helping the modeler along the integral modeling cycle. Several
examples with all the necessary ﬁles to reproduce them are included
in the toolbox and addressed in the documentation. These examples
reveal GSA as a powerﬁil tool for OED and for improving the
accuracy of the estimated model parameters.

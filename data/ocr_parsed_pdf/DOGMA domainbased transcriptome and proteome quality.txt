Abstract

Motivation: Genome studies have become cheaper and easier than ever before, due to the
decreased costs of high—throughput sequencing and the free availability of analysis software.
However, the quality of genome or transcriptome assemblies can vary a lot. Therefore, quality as—
sessment of assemblies and annotations are crucial aspects of genome analysis pipelines.

Results: We developed DOGMA, a program for fast and easy quality assessment of transcriptome
and proteome data based on conserved protein domains. DOGMA measures the completeness of
a given transcriptome or proteome and provides information about domain content for further ana—
lysis. DOGMA provides a very fast way to do quality assessment within seconds.

Availability and Implementation: DOGMA is implemented in Python and published under GNU
GPL v.3 license. The source code is available on https://ebbgit.uni—muenster.de/domainWorld/

1 Introduction

Genomics and transcriptomics have become key technologies in all
branches of life sciences over the last years and the huge amount of
resulting data calls for proper computational analysis methods.
Though many improvements were made in automatized sequence
assembly and genome annotation, both processes remain an ex—
tremely challenging task, and there are enormous differences in the
quality of the resulting data (Fang et (11., 2013). These differences re—
sult mainly from problems that can occur during the various steps of
an assembly and annotation pipeline. Reads can be of low quality,
they may not be precisely mapped and/or many small scaffolds
might exist, making subsequent steps in the pipeline, such as gene
annotation, more complicated.

Even with high quality assemblies, gene annotation is a complex
process and also with transcriptome data as supporting information,
gene models can be wrong, incomplete or missing altogether from

the annotation (Yandell and Ence, 2012). Therefore, quality assess—
ment of the results is important and, accordingly, several methods to
determine quality of reads, assemblies, transcriptome and proteome
data have been developed. Read quality can be assessed using per—
base error—rates or k—mer distributions (Clark et (11., 2013; Gurevich
et (11., 2013). For resulting genome or transcriptome assemblies, pro—
grams like CEGMA (Parra et (11., 2007) or BUSCO (Simao et (11.,
2015) have been developed. Both CEGMA and BUSCO use a similar
approach: a predefined set of genes, that are conserved over a spe—
cific clade, is compared to genes annotated in the genome or tran—
scriptome to be analyzed. The measured gene completeness, the
percentage of core genes found in the sample, is assumed to be repre—
sentative for the Whole gene set of the genome and is therefore used
as a quality indicator. The CEGMA scores of Ensembl genomes
(Cunningham et (11., 2014, version 81), for example, are in the range
of 46.77% (Vicugna pacos) to 97.58% (Saccharomyces cerevisiae).

The core set of CEGMA is based on ‘euKaryotic clusters of
Orthologous Groups’ (KOGs), resulting in a set of Core Eukaryotic
Genes (CEGs) (Tatusov et (11., 2003). BUSCO’s core gene set is based
on orthologous genes from OrthoDB (Waterhouse et (11., 2013).
CEGMA and BUSCO can be used for genome quality assessment,
while for transcriptomes and proteomes only BUSCO can be used.
The protein quality index (PQI) provides a list of quality scores for
publicly available proteomes (Zaucha et (11., 2015). The quality
score consists of different components, such as sequence length, do—
main content, percentage of undefined amino acids and others.
Protein domains are independently evolving structural and func—
tional building blocks of proteins (Marsh and Teichmann, 2010;
Moore et (11., 2008), known to be well conserved across taxa
(Ekman et (11., 2005). Usually, domains are represented as Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs). As HMMs are more sensitive than other
sequence search methods, protein domains can be identified in very
diverged sequences with HMMs (Remmert et (11., 2011). Because of
the better detection of protein domains, they are a good candidate
for quality assessment.

Protein domains can occur together in the same protein and
form in combination a domain arrangement, specified by their order
in the amino acid sequence (Forslund and Sonnhammer, 2012).

The domain content is considered in two different measures of
the PQI. The first one is that the sample proteome is searched for
SUPERFAMILY (Gough et (11., 2001) domain arrangements that
occur in the CEGs of CEGMA. The second measure is a simple com—
parison of the number of different domains that occur in the sample
proteome compared to the number of domains in the same clade.
However, no program is provided and new proteomes can only be
evaluated by sending a request to the providers of the PQI.

The domain content is incorporated in the program introduced
here as well. Domain arrangements have been successfully used in
different contexts such as homology search (Terrapon et (11., 2014)
or orthology construction (Bitard—Feildel et (11., 2015). The advent of
analyses using protein domains and their arrangements to study
functional roles and evolutionary relationships of proteins and com—
plete families demonstrates the utility of information about absence
or presence of specific protein domains and their arrangements (e.g.
Forslund and Sonnhammer, 2008; Moore and Bornberg—Bauer,
2012; Sardar et (11., 2014; Vogel et (11., 2005).

In this work we introduce DOGMA (DOmain—based General
Measure for transcriptome and proteome quality Assessment), a
program that facilitates the quick assessment of transcriptome and
proteome quality. DOGMA scores a sample transcriptome or prote—
ome regarding its completeness of conserved protein domains pro—
vided as percentage of a defined core set. Combined with a tool for
fast domain annotation (UProC (Meinicke, 2015)), DOGMA is able
to rapidly perform quality assessments and provide information
about missing domains and domain arrangements.

2 Methods

2.1 Construction of a core set of conserved domains
and domain arrangements

A core set of Conserved Domain Arrangements (CDAs) is used in
DOGMA to be compared against the transcriptome or proteome of
interest (the sample transcriptomejproteome). A CDA can also con—
sist of a single domain. Per default the core set consists of CDAs that
are conserved across six eukaryotic model species: (Arabidopsis
thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo
sapiens, Mus musculus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Beside this

eukaryotic core set, DOGMA offers alternatively specialized core
sets for mammals and insects (see below and Supplementary Online
Material).

To take into account the different requirements of transcriptome
and proteome data, DOGMA distinguishes between these two kinds
of data by scoring CDAs in different ways. For this reason DOGMA
can be run in a proteome and a transcriptome mode. The first step
of producing the core set of conserved CDAs is to annotate the do—
mains in the selected core species. We use UProC (Meinicke, 2015)
to produce the domain annotation of core as well as sample data.
UProC is very fast although this comes with the cost of a higher
memory usage. Because UProC does not provide positional informa—
tion of the domains it is not possible to use order information for
the domain arrangements. DOGMA therefore incorporates every
possible subset of domains in a single sequence. The size of CDAs
DOGMA considers can be selected by the user and is set to 3 by de—
fault. This means that domain arrangements comprising more do—
mains are considered as well, but just their subsets up to the size of 3
are counted (e.g. A—B—C—D —> A—B—C, A—B—D, A—C—D, B—C—D). We
analyzed the effect of the CDA size parameter on the comparison re—
sults by using different maximum sizes.

CDAs can occur in different organisms at a variable frequency.
The better conserved a CDA is, the more likely it should appear in
all core species at nearly the same frequency. Protein isoforms may
bias this analysis. For proteome data it is usually very easy to filter
out the different isoforms and keep only one version of the protein
(e.g. the longest). This approach does allow taking the frequency of
occurring CDAs into account in DOGMA (proteome mode). For the
construction of the core set DOGMA takes the minimum number of
CDAs that were encountered, but only uses CDAs that do not vary
by more than two in the number of occurrences among all core spe—
cies. Protein domain repeats are known to differ significantly in their
copy number (Ekman et (11., 2007). Therefore, all domains identified
as repeats in the Pfam database are handled separately by DOGMA
and just the lowest domain count shared by all core species is set as
the domain count for a particular CDA. However, to allow a sim—
pler usage on transcriptome data, an isoform cleaning step is not
required. Because of the missing isoform cleaning step, frequency in—
formation is not considered, but a more simplistic presence/absence
evaluation is used (transcriptome mode). Table 1 summarizes the
number of CDAs in the different core sets for both modes.

As UProC is not the standard program of the Pfam database,
DOGMA supports additionally PfamScan for domain annotation
that is provided by the Pfam database. PfamScan provides positional
information of domains in arrangements, but is much slower than
UProC. With PfamScan it is possible to take the order of domains in
CDAs into account (proteome mode), which might improve the re—
sult because the order of domains is often maintained over evolu—
tionary long distances (Kummerfeld and Teichmann, 2009). In this
case, DOGMA collapses consecutive duplications of domains in
CDAs to a single instance of the domain (e.g. A—B—B—B—C —> A—B—C),

as it has been shown that copy number variations can also occur be—
tween closely related species (Ekman et (11., 2007).

2.2 Evaluating a transcriptome/proteome using CDAs
Transcriptomes as well as proteomes can be evaluated using UProC
or PfamScan annotations. UProC can be directly applied to both
kinds of data. PfamScan annotations of transcriptomes, however,
need to be produced manually as an initial ORF prediction and
translation is necessary but not directly supported in DOGMA. The
subsequent evaluation of a sample transcriptome or proteome is exe—
cuted under the specifications stated above for the corresponding
core set construction. Next to the completeness score of the sample
transcriptome or proteome, all missing CDAs are listed in the
DOGMA output.

2.3 Benchmark and completeness scores in comparison
To validate the suitability of DOGMA’s completeness scores for as—
sessing data quality, different datasets were analyzed and the results
were compared to the results of existing programs. We used real as
well as simulated data. The real dataset consists of proteome and
transcriptome data on which DOGMA completeness scores were
compared to the scores generated with CEGMA (Parra et (11., 2007,
version 2.5) and BUSCO (version 1.1b). The real data consists of a
proteome set of all 69 species from Ensembl (Cunningham et (11.,
2014, version 81) and a transcriptome set of 98 tissue samples from
79 species (the same dataset that has been used to evaluate BUSCO
(Simao et (11., 2015)). For proteome data, the 69 Ensembl proteomes
were annotated with pfam domains (Finn et (11., 2014, version 28)
using UProC (Meinicke, 2015). These sets were then analyzed with
DOGMA and the corresponding genomes with CEGMA. BUSCO
evaluations were also based on the proteome data. BUSCO was add—
itionally used to analyze the transcriptome data and compared to an
annotation of the same data with UProC and subsequent analysis
with DOGMA. Core sets for eukaryotes, metazoans, vertebrates,
arthropods or fungi were used in BUSCO, while DOGMA utilized
core sets for eukaryotes, mammals or insects whenever suitable.
CEGMA used optimizations for vertebrates or mammals when suit—
able. The benchmark data has also been analyzed via DOGMA in a
combination with the PfamScan utilities for annotation instead of
UProC. The results can be found in the Supplementary Data. The
simulated dataset consists of several transcriptomes that have been
produced with a more relaxed adapter and quality trimming in each
run to have a stepwise decrease in transcriptome quality. The exact
process is described in the Supplementary Data.

3 Results and discussion

A comparison of the completeness scores of 69 proteomes calculated
with BUSCO, CEGMA and DOGMA is shown in Figure 1. The
completeness scores for the proteome data calculated with DOGMA
are highly correlated to the ones calculated with BUSCO (Pearson’s
Product Moment Correlation Test gives a Correlation Coefficient of
0.912 and a P—value of 1.113E—027) and CEGMA (Correlation
Coefficient: 0.890; P—value: 1.543E—024).

For a benchmark of the runtime compared between DOGMA
and BUSCO, DOGMA was used in a combination with UProC
(Meinicke, 2015) for domain annotation of the transcriptomes and
proteomes. Figure 2 shows the runtime BUSCO and DOGMA need
for analysis of the whole set of transcriptomes and proteomes. On
average DOGMA was over 40 times faster than BUSCO on the tran—
scriptome set. The maximum speedup achieved was more than 150

Fig.2. Benchmark of DOGMA versus BUSCO runtime for analysis of the com-
plete set of 96 transcriptomes and 69 proteomes. The runtime is shown in
hours (times for annotation via UProC are included for the DOGMA runtime).
The tools ran with one core on a machine with 12 cores and 64 GB RAM in
total

times faster. DOGMA was on average over 150 times faster on our
proteome dataset, with a maximum improvement of over 400 times.

When using the PfamScan annotation, completeness scores of
DOGMA show a slightly higher correlation to BUSCO scores (see
Supplementary Fig. S1) compared to the UProC annotation, but the
analysis runs slower than BUSCO (see Supplementary Fig. S2). The
completeness scores of the transcriptome dataset calculated by
BUSCO and DOGMA are highly correlated as well (Correlation
Coefficient: 0.914; P—value: 1.293E—038), as can be seen in Figure 3,
while DOGMA runs much faster on the same dataset (cp. Fig. 2). A
comparison with CEGMA is not possible on these data, because
CEGMA has only been designed to work with genomes.

DOGMA completeness scores are similar to completeness scores
calculated by BUSCO or CEGMA and represent a suitable measure
for the quality of transcriptome and proteome data. Nevertheless, the
completeness scores of DOGMA in transcriptome mode are generally
higher than those of BUSCO. A similar effect can be seen on the
simulated data (Supplementary Fig. S4). With increased error rate the
completeness scores of both BUSCO and DOGMA decrease, but this
trend is stronger in BUSCO. A reason for this higher scoring could be
that protein domains are generally more conserved than their corres—
ponding primary sequences (Fang et (11., 2013) and detection of the
domains should be easier than sequence based orthology detection
(Remmert et (11., 2011). Using protein domains would therefore result

Completeness Score [%]

Fig. 3. Completeness scores of 96 transcriptomes compared between BUSCO
and DOGMA. In both programs the most specific core set available was
applied. Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Test gives a Correlation
Coefficient of 0.914 and a P—value of 1.293E-038

in a more complete picture regarding completeness of the results be—
cause of fewer missed measurement units in the sample data (CDAs
versus single—copy orthologs/conserved genes). Another and on the
real data possibly more important point is that the three programs
have different ways to optimize the scoring for specific species
groups. CEGMA changes the allowed intron sizes when applied with
optimizations for vertebrates or mammals. DOGMA and BUSCO on
the other hand provide different core sets for different clades, but not
exactly for the same clades. A comparison of completeness scores of
the same proteomes based on different core sets with DOGMA can
be found in Supplementary Figure S3. Core sets are seen as more spe—
cific for an organism in comparison to another core set, if they con—
tain just species that belong to a group at a lower taxonomic level.
We have shown that core set specificity has an impact on the com—
pleteness score (see Supplementary Fig. S3). Additionally, it can be
expected that, the more specific a core set is for the sample organism,
the more clade specific domain arrangements are included in the ana—
lysis and with that the score can be seen as more realistic for the sam—
ple organism. Therefore, for best results, it is recommended to
choose an appropriate core set for the sample data. For this purpose,
next to the provided core sets, DOGMA offers the possibility to test
against self—made core sets. That can be useful for functional studies
and analyses of evolutionary relationships by testing candidates
against related taxa, getting information about missing domains in
particular lineages. To ensure that the core set is representative for
the whole clade, we performed a leave—one—out test. After the re—
moval of one species from the core set, the completeness scores
change only very little (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Additionally, we checked on the Ensembl dataset together with
the eukaryotic core set, whether changing the maximum CDA size
has strong inﬂuence on the completeness score (see Supplementary
Figs S6 and S7). The results show that the CDA size has little inﬂu—
ence, but the inﬂuence seems to be stronger when using DOGMA in
combination with UProC. In most cases the completeness score
seems to drop with an increase in CDA size, especially for proteomes
of lower quality. This can be expected, as likelihood of missing a
CDA increases with the increase of arrangement size.

4 Conclusion

The results presented here show that DOGMA achieves similar com—
pleteness scores as existing programs, but is able to run much faster

when it is used in combination with a fast domain annotation tool
such as UProC. Furthermore, the use of protein domains represents
a less biased approach because HMMs are more sensitive.
Therefore, HMMs are still able to detect domains even if the pri—
mary sequence has gained a lot of mutations. When running
DOGMA with UProC, the order of domains cannot be taken into
account (opposing to using PfamScan for the annotation). However,
the completeness scores produced with both methods do not differ
much and, due to the huge running time advantage and the possibil—
ity to apply UProC directly to transcriptomes, the usage of UProC is
generally recommended.

Another advantage compared to other quality assessment meth—
ods is that DOGMA offers straightforward additional information
about missing protein domains in the dataset that could be used for
functional analyses. In conclusion, DOGMA combined with
PfamScan annotations should be preferred for functional analyses,
because of the additional information about the order of domains in
domain arrangements. UProC is recommended for quality assess—
ments due to the extreme running time advantage at nearly the same
quality. Finally, the results presented above show that the choice of
an appropriate core set is important for the analysis. Both DOGMA
and BUSCO provide different core sets. However, with the excep—
tion of an eukaryotic core set, the core sets are based on different
clades. The test on the eukaryotic core set shows that the score is ro—
bust to slight changes in the core set as well as changes in the CDA
size. Note that the tools compared here cannot compete in every
type of analysis, because they are partly designed for different tasks.
DOGMA does not allow to analyze whole genomes like CEGMA
and BUSCO. On the other hand CEGMA cannot be used to analyze
transcriptome or proteome assemblies which is possible with
DOGMA or BUSCO.

We did not compare our program to the PQI because a stand
alone program is not available. However, we believe that our ap—
proach has several advantages over the domain metrics that are part
of PQI. Presumably a simple comparison of the number of domains
is not useful because domain types, selected arrangements for spe—
cific clades, and variation in frequency for particular domains are
important. Since the comparison of domain arrangements for the
PQI is based on CEGs, it is limited to eukaryotes and thus to a rela—
tively low number of domains. Moreover, there is no option to
choose a more specific core set for the PQI and therefore differences
regarding the domain content that might be of interest are lost.

To conclude, DOGMA introduces a new efficient quality assess—
ment, which is based on conserved protein domains and domain ar—
rangements, that is qualitatively comparable to other methods,
while DOGMA outperforms other programs on a great scale if com—
bined with a fast annotation tool.

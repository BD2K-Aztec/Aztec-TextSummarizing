ABSTRACT

Motivation: Next-generation sequencing technology allows the
detection of genomic structural variations, novel genes and transcript
isoforms from the analysis of high-throughput data. In this work, we
propose a new framework for the detection of fusion transcripts
through short paired-end reads which integrates splicing-driven
alignment and abundance estimation analysis, producing a more
accurate set of reads supporting the junction discovery and taking
into account also not annotated transcripts. Bellerophontes performs
a selection of putative junctions on the basis of a match to an
accurate gene fusion model.

Results: We report the fusion genes discovered by the proposed
framework on experimentally validated biological samples of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) and on public NCBI datasets, for which
Bellerophontes is able to detect the exact junction sequence. With
respect to state-of-art approaches, Bellerophontes detects the same
experimentally validated fusions, however, it is more selective on the
total number of detected fusions and provides a more accurate set of
spanning reads supporting the junctions. We finally report the fusions
involving non-annotated transcripts found in CML samples.

1 INTRODUCTION

The analysis of RNA-Seq data revealed to be particularly effective
for the detection of fused genes, which have been shown to be
involved in several diseases. By applying RNA-Seq short reads,
novel fusion genes and in particular the VAPB-IKZF3 Chimera have
been found to play a key role in the survival in breast cancer cells
(Edgren et (11., 2011). In Maher et al. (2009), the analysis of single
long reads has been performed to reveal novel fusion junctions.
However, the application of short paired-end reads has been recently
demonstrated to provide higher dynamic range and sensitivity in
supporting fusion transcripts (Maher et (11., 2009). In paired-end

reads, both the forward and reverse template strands of each DNA
fragment are sequenced. The two sequenced ends, also known as
the two ‘mate’ reads, are spaced by a gap of unknown nucleotides,
whose size is approximately known.

The nature of the paired-end reads and the way they map on
a gene fusion boundary offer the opportunity to detect possible
Chimeric candidates. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of
how the paired-end reads map on two fused genes. According to
the reads arrangement over the fusion junction, two scenarios might
occur as follows (i) each mate of the read encompasses the junction
and maps on a different gene of the fused gene couple. The read
is considered as a read ‘encompassing’ the fusion boundary; (ii)
alternatively, a single mate of the read overlaps the fusion junction
while the corresponding paired-end mate matches one of the two
genes involved in the fusion. In this case, the read is considered as
‘spanning’ the fusion junction.

Encompassing reads can be used to ﬁnd a ﬁrst list of gene
fusion candidates, while spanning reads are used to detect the exact
boundary sequence. Since in the case of spanning reads the mate
overlapping the junction breakpoint is discarded by conventional
short reads aligners, these reads must be searched on the set of
initially unmapped mates. These reads are then mapped on an
artiﬁcially constructed putative fusion junction from candidate gene
pairs previously detected through encompassing reads analysis.

In this work, we propose a new framework for the detection of
fusion transcripts through short paired-end reads. With respect to
currently available solutions, Bellerophontes provides the following
contributions:

gene fusion model. The model, based on validated
experimental evidence, is implemented by Bellerophontes
through a set of modular ﬁlters.

0 It integrates a splicing-driven alignment and abundance
estimation analysis, leading to a more accurate set of
reads supporting the junction discovery because it reduces
ambiguous assignments of reads to isoforms and allows
the detection of novel ﬁised transcripts. Furthermore, this
approach allows to account for those transcripts that are
consistently expressed in the sample under study, even if they
are not annotated.

0 The full pipeline has been developed on top of a splicing-
driven alignment. As a result, encompassing reads are mapped
more accurately even in presence of proximal splice junctions.
This enhances the accuracy of reads supporting fusion
candidate detection and junction sequence discovery.

To achieve these targets, Bellerophontes leverages upon
algorithms such as Cufﬂinks Trapnell et (11. (2010) and TopHat
Trapnell et (11. (2009), aimed at overcoming RNA-Seq Challenges
concerning multiple read alignment, novel transcript discovery
and accounting for alternative splicing. In addition, it exploits
recent researches about the pattern of reads mapping across
fusion breakpoints (Edgren et (11., 2011), enabling a more accurate
model of the fusion junction. On this concern, Bellerophontes
presents distinguishing features with respect to fusion detection
tools proposed in the last year (Li et (11., 2011; McPherson et (11.,
2011; Sboner et (11., 2010) http://tophat-fusion.sourceforge.net, in
that it integrates these new instruments in a fusion detection software
framework.

In this article, we report the fusion genes discovered by
the proposed framework on experimentally validated biological
samples of Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (Soverini et (11.,
2011), and on public NCBI datasets of validated ﬁisions. We
also performed a comparative analysis with an alternative state-
of—art approach (McPherson et (11., 2011) on the same datasets.
The results highlight that Bellerophontes, while recognizing the
validated ﬁisions, reduced the ﬁnal set of predictions and includes
ﬁisions involving non-annotated genes.

2 METHODS

2.1 Procedure and algorithms

This section ﬁrst focuses on the computational infrastructure of the proposed
tool and. then reports details about the application of the tool to real data
analysis. The ﬂow is mainly composed of two building blocks: ‘chimeric
candidates detection” and ‘exact junction breakpoint analysis” (Fig. 2).
‘chimeric candidates detection” aims at providing the list of possible chimeric
candidates by detecting and analyzing those reads encompassing putative
fusion junctions. ‘exact junction breakpoint analysis” relies on the detection
of the exact junction breakpoint between two gene candidates through the
collection of reads spanning the putative junction breakpoint.

2.1.1 Chimeric candidates detection Figure 2a depicts the schematic ﬂow
of the chimeric candidates detection. This phase is composed of three steps:
(i) Initial sample alignment to the genome reference; (ii) mapping of read
mates to transcripts determined by abundance analysis and (iii) detection of
the encompassing reads from the overall set.

Candidate

Initial sample alignment. The starting point for determining the list
of chimeric candidates is the alignment of short RNA-Seq paired-end
reads to the reference genome (initial sample alignment). Most of fusion
detection tools adopt Bowtie Langmead et a1. (2009) for aligning paired-
end reads to the reference genome. Conversely. we exploit the capability
of TopHat alignment tool (Trapnell at (11.. 2009) to align read fragments on
a reference genome considering splicing events. TopHat reports variable
length alignments due to the presence of splicing junction breakpoints.
Consequently. the framework has to take into account spliced alignments
to the reference genome instead of ﬁxed length reads. At the end of the
initial alignment of paired-end reads. both mapped (that include possible
encompassing) and unmapped (that include possible spanning) reads are
extracted.

Mate-gene mapping. In order to ﬁnd out candidate genes involved in
a fusion event. we need to assign the read location to an annotation ﬁle.
In the ‘mate-gene mapping” (see Fig. 2). we map each aligned mate on the
transcripts detected by transcript abundance analysis by means of Cufﬂinks
(Trapnell at (11.. 2010). thus overcoming the limit of considering only known
and annotated transcripts. In fact. analyzing RNA-Seq samples it is possible
to reveal new alternative splicing events. novel genes and transcripts that
might be neglected in an ofﬁcial annotation ﬁle. This is relevant in the
context of chimeric transcripts. which are unpredictable events. In this
context. a fusion possibly involves non-annotated genes or genes showing
intron retentions. Considering only annotated gene isoforms. those reads
encompassing the non-annotated region would be discarded and thus the
fusion would not be detected.

Discordant mates detection and candidate ﬁltering. The collected set
of mapped read mates is analyzed in order to retrieve the subset of reads
having the two mates mapping on different genes. At the end of the chimeric
candidates detection phase. the list of possible gene candidates and the set
of initially unmapped reads are provided.

On this set of candidates. a cascade of ﬁlters is applied to reduce the impact
of errors due to the alignment phase as well as artifacts in the preparation of
the biological sample (Edgren at (11.. 2011). Moreover. ambiguous alignments
due to paralogue or homologous regions are taken into account. Related ﬁlters
will be discussed at the end of this section. As regards ﬁlters on artifacts. they
are aimed at discarding: (i) reads that detect multiple couples of gene fusion
candidates that. besides their discordant matching. they also have both mates
on the same gene and (ii) reads showing an abnormal inner size (computed
as described in Fig. 3) between the sequenced ends. or asymmetry in the
alignment of the mates encompassing a fused gene (an example is shown in
Fig. 4).

We focus now the discussion on the this second type of ﬁlter. namely. the
‘abnormal inner size ﬁlter”. which implements a strategy similar to Sboner
et a1. 2010. where the distribution of the inner distances in the sample is
computed and outliers are removed based on a threshold. In this work. this
has been set to 400 bp. In Bellerophontes. inner distance is computed through
consensus regions as depicted in Figure 3. This is a minimum inner distance.

Fig. 4. Asymmetric abnormal fusions. Example of abnormal fusion. The
gene candidate B presents a consensus that is widely larger than the partner

because the consensus regions are made by encompassing reads and for this
reason they may not be complete. as reads spanning the junction in this phase
of the pipeline are not considered. As such. the inner distance is in general
larger than the sum of the consensi determined through encompassing reads.

In this work. we also propose a new and extended implementation that
takes into consideration a recent observation in Edgren at al. (2011) about the
asymmetry in the alignment. This is recognized to be a feature of artifacted
chimeric transcripts.

This ﬁlter looks at consensus regions made by encompassing reads on
the candidate genes. The length of these regions is computed (excluding
possible gaps in between) as shown in Figure 3. If one of the two regions.
for instance the one related to Candidate A in Figure 4. is much larger than
the corresponding consensus region of the Candidate B. the couple AiB is
discarded.

After ﬁltering the reads involved in artifacts and alignment errors. another
set of ﬁlters on chimeric candidates is performed. Candidates supported by
a percentage of ambiguous reads with respect to the total number of reads
are discarded (see Table 3 in Section 3 for details). Ambiguous reads are
caused by short or long homologous sequences in the reference genome.
Fusion detection analysis is affected because the mate pairs that. without
homologous sequences. would match on the same gene. match discordantly
on two distinct but similar genes. thus creating fake encompassing reads.
Homologous regions may be due both to the presence of paralogue genes that
share long sequence regions and to the presence of short similar sequences.

The ‘homologous sequence artifacts ﬁlter” implements two different
policies for both cases. Concerning the long homologous sequences due
to paralogue genes. a ﬁlter that query TreeFam (Li et a1.. 2006) database

has been implemented. For short homologous sequences. we apply a
strategy similar to what proposed in Sboner at al. (2010). where read mates
encompassing the fusion candidates are extracted and reversely mapped on
the same genes.

The remaining ﬁlters look at gene candidate distance and number of
supporting encompassing reads. In particular. fusions occurring between
genes closer than a user deﬁned threshold are ﬁltered out by the
‘neighbor candidate ﬁlter”. as they are considered instances of transcriptional
readthroughs (Edgren et a1.. 2011). Finally. since both alignment bias and
biological sample preparation artifacts produce false fusion candidates that
are typically supported by a small number of encompassing reads. chimeric
candidates having the number of encompassing reads below a user-deﬁned
threshold are ﬁltered out by the ‘supported candidates thresholding ﬁlter.
The threshold value depends on the coverage of the overall sequencing
experiment and adopted protocol.

2.1.2 Junction breakpoint analysis Starting from the list of fused
candidates previously detected. the scope of the exact junction breakpoint
analysis phase. outlined in Figure 2b. is to determine the exact junction
breakpoint and validate the gene fusion by the alignment of unmapped reads
to the putative junction.

From a computational point of View. the problem of ﬁnding gene fusion
junctions can be considered an extension of the detection of splicing events
involving exons couples belonging to different genes and chromosomes.
Splicing events introduce a considerable level of complexity in the analysis
of RNA-Seq fragments. Intron regions cause many mismatches. making
alignment programs to fail across the junction. Splicing discovery programs
(Ameur et a1.. 2010; Bryant et a1.. 2010; Trapnell et a1.. 2009) are aimed at
efﬁciently detecting the exact introniexon boundary. Due to the considerable
computational complexity. they limit their research within a maximum
intron size.

To exploit the junction discovery capabilities of splicing detection tools
without compromising computational efﬁciency. exact junction breakpoint
analysis adopts a Virtual reference: (i) for each couple of gene candidates. a
Virtual reference consisting in the concatenation of the two genes is created
and (ii) a splicing discovery algorithm (i.e. TopHat) is launched on the Virtual
reference providing as input the initially unmapped reads resulting from the
‘chimeric candidates detection phase.

As shown in Figure 2b. in order to create a ‘Virtual fusion junction”
a ‘create Virtual reference” module automatically retrieves the sequences
corresponding to the gene fusion candidates using the coordinates provided
by Cufﬂinks. The corresponding sequence is retrieved from the reference
in ‘UCSC Genome Browser database” (Fujita et a1.. 2010). Being based
on Cufﬂinks coordinates. the sequences retrieved on the reference may
correspond to annotated or non-annotated genes.

The sequences are then concatenated and the resulting ﬁle represents the
Virtual genome reference of the Virtual fusion junction. TopHat receives as
input the set of unmapped reads and the Virtual genome reference. resulting
from the concatenation of the two gene fusion candidates. The result of
TopHat is a ﬁle containing all the mapping reads including the spanning end
mates. After TopHat alignment. a rearrangement from Virtual to chromosomal
coordinates is needed.

Once the set of end mates spanning. the gene fusion junction is collected
and the read coordinates are translated from Virtual to genomic ‘coordinates” .
it is possible to exactly determine the boundary junction among the two gene
candidates. As shown in Figure 5. end mate reads spanning the fusion junction
can be represented as a split read and each chunk maps on a different gene
section. It is worth noting that all the spanning mate chunks are spaced by
a gap in the genome reference. The exact points where the ﬁrst mate chunk
ends and the second mate chunk starts represent the exact junction boundary
coordinates.

In conclusion. at the end of the exact junction breakpoint analysis for
each couple of gene fusion candidates. the set of putative junctions as well
as the supporting spanning reads are reported. However. the detection of
spanning reads can be affected by propagation errors due to both alignment

Fig. 6. Floating fragment removal ﬁlter. Some subsequence of the same Read
Mate A maps differently on the two Candidate Gene A and B. Speciﬁcally
a small fragment ﬂoats along the Candidate Gene B. The ﬂoating fragment
removal ﬁlter removes the ﬂoating fragments considering as a valid mapping
only the subsequences commonly mapped to the reference. Finally. only a
single instance of read mapping is reported

limitations and artifacts in the experimental preparation of the sample. For
this reason. the resulting junctions are analyzed and ﬁltered depending on
how the spanning read maps on each junction. Next section describes the
ﬁltering policy applied to improve the accuracy of the junction detection.

2.1.3 Spanning read analysis and junction ﬁltering The exact junction
breakpoint analysis provides a list of putative junctions boundaries between
two fused genes. A selection is performed at this stage by looking at the
distribution of the reads spanning the junction. to reveal possible artifacts.
Therefore. we apply some ﬁlters in order to remove all the artifact junctions
from the resulting set and to make junctions list more accurate.

It might occur that the same read mate maps on the putative junction
in multiple ways. In fact. some subsequences of the gene sequence might
be homologous and consequently some small fragments of the read mate
match the candidate gene in multiple places of the sequence. Thus. these
fragments ﬂoat on multiple places of the gene sequence and the accuracy
of their mapping may be compromised. Furthermore. when this scenario
occurs. TopHat reports a distinct read mate instance for each multiple match.
However. this does not lead to a realistic count of the number of read mates
supporting the junction.

To address this issue. we propose ‘Floating Fragment Removal Filter” that
removes all the small ﬂoating fragments of the read mate sequence mapping
on multiple places of the reference gene. Figure 6. on the upper part. shows
an example where the second mate is characterized by fragments mapping
on different locations. Speciﬁcally. this ﬁlter detects and preserves all those
read mate subsequences mapping the reference in the same region (see the
middle part of Fig. 6). In this way. only those read portions that are highly
probable to be correctly mapped on the reference sequence are considered
to support the putative junction. Moreover. as only the commonly mapped
subsequences are preserved. it is pointless to report multiple instances of the
same read mate. therefore the mate is considered as a unique (see bottom
part of 6).

A second ﬁlter. named PCR artifacts removal ﬁlter. is based on the
observation that PCR ampliﬁcation might cause false-putative junctions

Fig. 7. PCR artifact removal ﬁlter. (a) The schema of a group of read mates
spanning a genuine fusion junction. The short reads present a ladder-like
pattern and they all map on distinct points of the candidate genes involved
in the fusion. (b) An example of a group of read mates mapping a false
breakpoint junction. Short reads are more overlapped as all the reads share
a similar start and end mapping locations

(Edgren et al.. 2011). Reads mapping exactly to the same position are likely
due to an artifact originated by ampliﬁcation and sequencing of the same
initial fragment repeated more times. As a result. multiple identical reads are
considered as a single one and the fusion supported by those reads will be
discarded unless other supporting spanning reads will be found.

Since Cufﬂinks performs a transcript abundance analysis to detect the
transcripts on which we map each aligned mate. reads duplication could
affect the correct detection of the genes involved in the fusion as well as its
junction breakpoint. We avoid the problem through the PCR artifact removal
ﬁlter. Real fusions are characterized by a ladder-like pattern of the spanning
reads supporting the junction (Fig. 7a). Conversely. false-positive junctions
due to PCR ampliﬁcation artifacts lack this pattern and all the short read
mates spanning the junction either map on the same position or are one or
two bases shifted (Fig. 7b). The PCR artifacts removal ﬁlter removes all
those putative junctions lacking the ladder-like pattern.

A ﬁnal ﬁltering is performed on as follows (i) candidate fusions supported
by a number of spanning reads lower than a user deﬁned threshold (supported
junctions thresholding ﬁlter) and (ii) coherency with encompassing reads.
In particular. the latter is based on the observation that. in presence of a
genuine gene fusion. the genomic coordinates of the set of encompassing
reads must be adjacent or in some cases overlapped to the location of
the spanning reads. Bellerophontes creates a consensus of the ﬁnal set of
both encompassing and spanning reads and checks if the coordinates of the
corresponding locations are either adjacent of overlapped. If this check is
negative. the fusion candidate is discarded.

2.2 Real data analysis

2.2.] Materials and sample preparation We present result about the
detection of chimeric transcripts on three datasets at different stages of CML
progression from a Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML patient
(sample s_4. s_7 and s_8; Soverini et al.. 2011). The patient was diagnosed
with Ph+ p210BCR-ABL-positive CML by chromosome banding analysis.
The samples were tested for rearrangements between BCR and ABL genes
by reverse transcriptionipolymerase chain reaction (RTiPCR; Dongen et al..
1999).

RNA-Seq libraries (one per sample) were prepared using the mRNA-
Seq 8 sample preparation kits following the manufacturer”s instructions. We
modiﬁed the gel extraction step by dissolving excised gel slices at room
temperature to avoid underrepresentation of AT-rich sequences (Quail et al..
2009). Library quality control and quantiﬁcation were performed with a
Bioanalyzer Chip DNA 1000 series 11 (Agilent). Libraries were sequenced
on an Illumina genome analyzer 11 following the manufacturer”s instructions
and 75 bp paired-end reads were obtained.

The second dataset we used for evaluation is a public sets of RNA-
Seq data including information about RT-PCR validated fusions [Berger
et al.. 2010]. obtained from NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
sra) under submission numbers SRA009053 and SRA040160.

2.2.2 Fusions detected on real samples For both CML samples and NCBI
datasets, we report the number of detected fusions. For all the reported
analysis Bellerophontes ran with GCCh37/hg February 19, 2009 assembly
of the human genome, while we used GRCh37 ﬁle for annotations from
Ensembl.

Table 1 reports the statistics concerning all the CML samples and details
about the number of total fusions detected. In all the samples, Bellerophontes
detects the exact sequence of the chimeric fusion. In the last column, the
number of intra chromosomic fusions are shown. Filter parameters used for
these runs have been set as follows. Minimum supporting reads: 8; neighbor
candidates ﬁlters: 500 000 bp; inner distance threshold: 400 bp.

Under the hypothesis that the scientist is not interested in adjacent fused
genes (Edgren et al., 2011), that can be detected by classical splicing
detection tools, we set the neighbor candidates ﬁlters with 500 000 bp
thresholds and this caused most of the revealed fusions to be inter-
chromosome.

Table 2 highlights the capability of Bellerophontes concerning the
detection of validated fusions on a published dataset. These samples have
lower coverage (at most 16 million reads) and smaller read length (50 bp)
compared with CML data (see Table 1 for comparison). All the 14 fusions
validated in the seven samples of melanoma cells (Berger et al., 2010) and
the TMPRSS2/ERG fusion (causally linked to prostate cancer) in NC1H660
(Sboner et al., 2010) have been successfully detected. For the analysis of
NCBI samples, some ﬁlter constrains have been set to be less stringth with
respect to CML samples, because of the speciﬁc characteristics of NCBI
dataset in terms of coverage and presence of readthroughs. In particular,
the threshold on the number of encompassing in the supported candidate
thresholding ﬁlter was set to 2, since a lower coverage may cause a smaller
number of supporting encompassing reads (see Table 5). Furthermore, the
threshold for the neighbor candidate ﬁlter was set to 50 bp to account for the
larger number of readthroughs in this dataset.

Fig. 8. Junction boundary detection. Results of the exact junction breakpoint
analysis applied to CML samples. The fusion sequence corresponding to
BCR and ABL] genes is reported as well as the group of reads spanning the
junction boundary. The exons involved into the fusion are also indicated in
correspondence of the fusion boundary points

2.2.3 Exact junction discovery details Figure 8 depicts the results of the
exact junction breakpoint analysis applied to CML samples. A group of reads
is mapped onto the reference genome spanning the fusion boundary between
the BCR and ABL] genes. This chimera has been validated through RTiPCR
analysis. The spanning reads reported in Figure 8 show a ladder-like pattern
across the junction boundary according to the junction model we use in this
work. The exons involved in the fusion are exon 14 (s_4), exon 1(s_7) and
exon 13 (s_8) of BCR and exon 2 of ABL] .

Fusions involving non-annotated genes Using transcript expression
analysis instead of annotated genes, Bellerophontes is able to detect fusions
involving non-annotated genes. The analysis of Sample s_8 reveals that 3 of
10 fusions involved non-annotated transcripts. For instance, Bellerophontes
identiﬁes a fusion involving EWSRI gene (chr22:29664273-29669806)
and a not annotated gene (namely, CufﬂinksNovelGene chr14: 36350337-
36350395). This feature is relevant for the detection of new aberrant
modiﬁcations in the gene regulation, which is one of the main targets of
next-generation sequencing analysis.

*Naming incoherencies are detected when the same gene name share different gene

single gene.

The reported percentages are computed as the ratio between the number of ﬁltered
candidates and the number of candidates ﬁltered by the previous ﬁlter

approach (McPherson et al., 2011), which has been used to discover
gene ﬁisions in tumour samples (Steidl et al., 2011).

3.1 Filtering effects

We detail the effects of the various ﬁlters applied both to the
candidate ﬁisions and to the spanning reads. We report ﬁltering
results of only the CML samples, but similar considerations can
be drown for NCBI samples. Table 3 shows the effect of ﬁlters on
candidate ﬁisions (Section 2.1.1) while Figure 9 refers to spanning
reads ﬁltering. Numbers in the tables report the percentage of
candidates removed with respect to the previous ﬁlter in the cascade.

3.1.1 Eﬂects of ﬁlters on candidate fusions The considerable
number of initial candidates detected in the ﬁrst phase by discordant
read mapping (up to 122 931 in s_8 sample) is consistently reduced
through the pipeline of ﬁlters shown in Table 3. A large fraction of
candidates is discarded because it was not supported by a sufﬁcient
number of encompassing reads (see third column in Table 3).
Moreover, 32%—37% of putative ﬁisions with a sufﬁcient number of
encompassing reads has been removed because of abnormal inner
size and asymmetry in consensus regions.

Because of its large computational cost due to the reverse
remapping of the encompassing reads, the homologous sequence
artifacts ﬁlter has been applied as a ﬁnal step on a reduced set of
candidates. This ﬁlter was very selective, leaving 3%—8% of putative
candidates for the following spanning analysis phase.

3.1.2 Eﬂects of ﬁlters on junction artifacts Both alignment bias
and biological artifacts due to PCR ampliﬁcation might cause
the detection of false putative junctions. In order to mitigate the
negative effects of these events on the Chimeric transcript analysis,
the ﬁlters described in Section 2.1.3 are applied during the exact
junction breakpoint analysis phase. Figure 9 reports the effect of the
application of the ﬁlters on the initial number of putative junctions
detected for each sample. The initial number of junctions (i.e.
spanning reads) is in general larger than the candidates resulted
from the ﬁrst encompassing analysis phase of the tool, since each
candidate has multiple spanning reads associate to it.

The ﬂoating fragment removal ﬁlter does not reduce the number
of the initial putative junctions. However, it plays a ﬁindamental
role for the following PCR artifacts removal ﬁlter. In fact, the
ﬂoating fragments cause false ladder-like patters that are actually
replicas of the same reads (see Fig. 6). The ﬂoating fragment removal
ﬁlter removes the ﬂoating fragments and it allows a more accurate

junctions after the cascade of the ﬁlters on initially putative junction detected
for the biological sample. The number of junction after the application of
each ﬁlter is reported on the top of each histogram column

detection of PCR artifacts. Therefore, the PCR artifacts removal
ﬁlter removes from the 9 to 20% of false putative junctions and the
number of junctions ranges in the best case (sample s_8) from 427 to
339. Moreover, the removal of the ﬂoating fragments makes in some
cases to considerably decrease the number of reads spanning across
the putative junction (see Fig. 6). Consequently, the ‘supported
junctions thresholding” ﬁlter is more effective after applying ﬂoating
fragment removal ﬁlter and the reduction spans from 39 to 62%.

3.2 Comparative analysis

To highlight that the proposed approach provides results comparable
with state-of-art tools while it introduces original features improving
fusion discovery, we compared Bellerophontes analysis with deFuse
(McPherson et al., 2011) on both CML samples and a published
dataset. This represents a very recent fusion detection tool using
paired-end reads. Its basic version has been shown to improve
other tools such as FusionSeq (Sboner et al., 2010) and MapSplice
(Wang et a1 ., 2010) in detecting experimentally validated fusions. We
applied deFuse version 0.4.2 with defaults options for the analysis
on CML samples. We also compare public results in McPherson
et a1. (2011) with our results on the NCBI datasets.

Table 4 shows the ﬁnal number of ﬁisions predicted with
Bellerophontes and deFuse on CML samples. This table also
reports the number of encompassing and spanning reads for BCR-
ABLI fusion (validated through RT—PCR). The number of predicted
fusions by deFuse is higher for all the samples. While implementing
more selective ﬁlters Bellerophontes still detects BCR-ABL] with
a comparable number of encompassing and spanning. We note that
there are several deFuse-unique ﬁisions that are supported by a low
number of spanning reads (i.e. <8). Those fusions are discarded
by Bellerophontes because of the supported candidate thresholding
ﬁlter, whose threshold was set to 8.

The smaller number of predicted fusions is also due to the
usage of Cufﬂinks to map the discordant read mates. Indeed, only
candidates with a minimum level of abundance are considered,
reducing the set of possible ﬁised genes to be evaluated in the
successive stages of the pipeline. Indeed, we observed that most
of the candidates provided by deFuse have been discarded by
Bellerophontes because the related genes are ﬁltered out by Cufﬂinks
with default parameters, due to their low abundance. Note that, if
we are interested in detecting junctions between poorly expressed
candidates, it is possible to run Cufﬂinks with less restrictive

parameters. Note also that the set of candidates given by deFuse
is not a superset of our candidates, this means that we ﬁnd some
candidates, that deFuse does not ﬁnd, having a relevant expression.
To quantify the impact of Cufﬂinks, we performed experiments with
relaxed parameters. We observed an increasing number of ﬁisions
in common with deFuse, up to 85%. We do not state that these
additional ﬁisions are false positives. Rather, we believe that it is
of interest of the biologist to be able to distinguish between ﬁisions
involving more or less expressed transcripts, because this may be
correlated with protein expression analysis.

The number of encompassing and spanning reads in s_4 sample
is comparable for both the tools, whereas for the s_7 sample
deFuse presents an higher coverage. This is mainly due to the
different alignment programs (Bowtie for deFuse and TopHat for
Bellerophontes) and to the usage of Cufﬂinks transcript annotations
in the proposed pipeline. In particular, our alignment and annotation
methodology reduces the probability of multiple matches, which
may lead to candidates with higher read coverage but not really
expressed.

On the other side, considering results in Table 5, in case of
ﬁisions ANKHDl-CSorf32 (sample 018260), C10rf61-CCT3 and
MIXLl-PARPl (sample 018266), we observe a larger number of
spanning reads supporting the validated junction. The number of
spanning reads strongly depends on the splicing detection algorithm.
Bellerophontes integrates TopHat in its pipeline, which allows to
improve the quality of spanning reads detection. This becomes
evident especially in case of junctions where deFuse shows a poor
spanning reads coverage. For instance, in the case of sample s_8
(see Table 4) of CML dataset and sample 018260 (see Table 5), the
number of Bellerophontes detected spanning is considerably higher
compared to deFuse. This result is coherent with the experimental
validation [the fusion in the 018260 sample is validated with
RT—PCR (Berger et al., 2010)].

4 DISCUSSION

The proposed framework implements a new analysis pipeline that
exploits effective alignment and annotation algorithms as well as a
ﬁltering stage based on an accurate modeling of the junction. RNA-
Seq data analysis presents major Challenges concerning ambiguous
assignments of reads to isoforms that can impact fusion detection.
Indeed, fusion candidates are discovered by means of encompassing
reads. As such, the accuracy in detection of discordant mates is a key
feature of a fusion detection pipeline. Bellerophontes introduces a
new approach where reads are mapped on experimental determined
transcripts rather than using a reference genome, thus reducing the
probability of multiple matches that may affect state-of—art fusion
detection tools based on basic alignment algorithms.

*All the library identiﬁers, with exception of the last row, refer to the accession number
reporting the SRR preﬁx in the NCBI databank.

A similar effect can be noted on the analysis of spanning
reads supporting the junctions. By taking splicing events into
consideration, Bellerophontes obtain a more robust detection of the
exact junction sequence, which becomes evident especially where
the number of supporting reads is poor. Note that the number of
encompassing and spanning reads represent a discriminatory factor
to conduct a successive experimental validation of the data provided
by the software analysis.

The improved accuracy revealed another positive effect, that is the
ﬁnal number of detected fusions, even in the most covered libraries
(s_7 and s_8), is compatible with a cost sensitive experimental
validation. Moreover, in s_8 three fusions involving non-annotated
genes are detected.

To improve selectivity, the pipeline integrates a set of ﬁlters,
embedding a new and more effective junction model. Indeed, this
ﬁlter discards a large number of candidates. Finally, results about
spanning read ﬁltering and spanning-encompassing coherence Check
highlight that a junction ﬁltering is a critical step to provide an
accurate set of junctions.

Note that in all the CML samples Bellerophontes was able to
detect the expected and validated BCR—ABL] fusion even in a
selective ﬁltering context.

Comparative results obtained on both CML and NCBI dataset
show that Bellerophontes is able to accurately detect gene ﬁisions
and improves the accuracy of spanning reads with respect to deFuse.
This cross-benchmarking was performed since deFuse presented the
most complete biological validation and it has shown to improve
state-of—art tools like FusionSeq (Sboner et al., 2010). The results
indicate that deFuse is not able to detect Chimeric transcripts
involving non-annotated genes present in s_8. On the other side,
Bellerophontes is much more selective, reducing the total number
of fusion candidates with respect to deFuse (see Table 4).

Bellerophontes is based on pair-end reads. Other recently
proposed approaches such as FusionMap (Ge et al., 2011)
exploit long single-end reads spanning the junction. Compared to
FusionMap, our framework includes the support for new transcripts
and the accurate mapping in presence of alternative splicing events.

We also performed a comparative analysis of Bellerophontes
against deFuse, TopHat-Fusion (http://tophat-fusion.sourceforge.
net) and Chimerascan (Iyer et al., 2011), on the CML samples. All
of them recognized BCR—ABL] and provided a set of additional
ﬁisions. Interestingly, there was almost no overlap among all the
tools in respect of these additional ﬁisions (Fig. 10). For this reason,
most of them are likely to be false-positive. It can be noted that
Bellerophontes has the smaller set of this additional fusions. Finally,
we in order to ﬁirther evaluate the performance of the proposed
method we performed analysis on an additional dataset, that is
MCF 7 cell line by Edgren et a1. (2011), for which we found all
the validated fusions, namely, BCAS4-BCAS3, ARFGEF2-SULF2
and RPS6KB1-TMEM49.

Bellerophontes is implemented in Java/Perl/Bash language. It runs
on a standard Linux machine and it fully supports multithreaded
computation. The performance strongly depends on the memory and
number of CPUs available. However, the analysis on the proposed
datasets have been performed with an Intel I7 TM920 at 2.67 GHz
and 16 GB of RAM Memory.

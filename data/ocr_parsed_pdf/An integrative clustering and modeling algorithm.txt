ABSTRACT

Motivation: The precise dynamics of gene expression is often crucial
for proper response to stimuli. Time-course gene-expression profiles
can provide insights about the dynamics of many cellular responses,
but are often noisy and measured at arbitrary intervals, posing a
major analysis challenge.

Results: We developed an algorithm that interleaves clustering
time-course gene-expression data with estimation of dynamic
models of their response by biologically meaningful parameters. In
combining these two tasks we overcome obstacles posed in each
one. Moreover, our approach provides an easy way to compare
between responses to different stimuli at the dynamical level. We use
our approach to analyze the dynamical transcriptional responses to
inflammation and anti-viral stimuli in mice primary dendritic cells, and
extract a concise representation of the different dynamical response
types. We analyze the similarities and differences between the two
stimuli and identify potential regulators of this complex transcriptional
response.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding a complex transcriptional response to stimuli is a
key goal in biological research. Such a response involves a timely
activation and repression of hundreds of genes, requiring a tight
and accurate regulation. For example, the transcriptional response
to inﬂammation in immune cells in mice is regulated by at least
a dozen transcription factors, operating through different modes
of activation, including fast responding factors (e.g. NFKB) and
secondary response factors synthesized de novo during the response
(e.g. Irf8), resulting in a wide range of dynamical transcriptional
responses (Gilmore, 2006; Medzhitov and Homg, 2009). Thus,
to fully understand the transcriptional response, a static analysis
indicating which genes are induced at one given time point is not
sufﬁcient, and it is important to analyze the transcriptional dynamics
of the induced genes.

A widely used approach to study transcription dynamics is
by collecting time course measurements of gene-expression in
predeﬁned time points following a stimuli. A possible concern in

analysis of such data is the inherent limitation of gene-expression
measurements. These are exacerbated by the temporal aspects of
the data—the chosen time points might not capture the interval in
which a gene is up-regulated. As a result this data is often difﬁcult
to analyze, and the comparison between experiments carried over
different time courses is non-trivial.

In the literature there are several approaches for analysis of time-
course data. One approach is to cluster the data so that every cluster
captures a group of genes with similar dynamical response. This
can be done using traditional clustering algorithms, such as K -mean
(Duda and Hart, 1973). However, the stande distance functions are
not adequate to handle the given data which is sampled at various
non-uniformly distributed time points. Several works addressed this
speciﬁc task, Ernst et al. (2005) addressed this obstacle by assigning
genes to a preselected set of potential proﬁles. However, the set of
potential proﬁles are not selected from the data, and might contain
proﬁles that do not represent true biological responses. An additional
obstacle is that the clustering is done on the noisy and missing
expression patterns of genes which might lead to false assignments
to clusters. Thus, an unbiased clustering algorithm ﬁtted for this type
of data is needed.

An alternative approach is to consider a mathematical model of the
response dynamics, and then ﬁt it to measurements. This in effect,
translates the discrete measurements to a continuous ﬁinction from a
biologically plausible family of functions. Moreover, the parameters
of this class of functions can be biologically relevant and mark the
important aspects of the dynamics (e.g. point of induction). For
example the impulse model proposed by Chechik and Koller (2009),
is designed to capture the typical impulse-like response to a stimulus,
using a ﬁlnction with biologically meaningful parameters. A problem
with models such as this one is that they have many parameters and
can lead to overﬁtting over a typically small number of time points.
In addition, the modeling is done per individual gene, thus clustering
is still necessary to obtain a concise representation of the dynamical
responses types.

Here, we present DynaMiteC (Dynamic Modeling and
Clustering), an integrative approach that simultaneously models
time course gene-expression proﬁles with biologically meaningful
parameters, and assigns them to clusters of different dynamical
responses. Our approach is to model gene responses using an
impulse model (Fig. la). Our premise is that many genes have a
similar response. Thus, instead of estimating the proﬁle of each gene
separately, and thus risk overﬁtting, our method estimates the proﬁle
with a prior that prefers to match one out of a set of ‘prototype’
responses (Fig. lb). We thus pose the parameter estimation task

as jointly learning the prototypes and the parameters of individual
genes. When learning these prototypes we, in fact, assign genes to
clusters. These two problems are solved by iterating between them
(Fig. 1c).

We used DynaMiteC to study the responses to two related
stimuli in mice primary dendritic cells that simulate either
inﬂammation (LPS stimulus) and anti-viral infection (polyIC
stimulus). In their experiment, Amit et al. (2009) collected gene
expression measurements of a dense time course following the
stimulus. We show that our revised impulse model and algorithm
result in a good ﬁt for the induced genes and meaningful clusters.
We reveal distinct types of dynamical response to stimulation, and
compare between genes that have the same dynamical response
under both conditions and other genes that change their response
dynamics. In addition, we point out potential transcription factors
that could regulate this complex transcriptional response.

2 MODELING WITH MIXTURE PRIORS AND
CLUSTERING

Suppose we want to model time course data. A model is a family
of functions f (t : 0) that for each choice of parameters 0 (in a space
of legal parameters (9) determines how the expression behaves as
a function of 1 (time). To simplify the discussion, we assume that
f is differentiable with respect to 0 and that 9 is a convex set.
We discuss an example of such a family of functions based on the
impulse model explained below.

2.1 Mixture priors

We start by setting up the learning problem and examine how to
integrate priors into the modeling procedure and their importance.
Given a series of data points describing the behavior of a gene
g, D8 = ((11,x1,g), ...,(tk,xksg)) (where xisg is the expression value
of gene g at time point 1,) we deﬁne the loss (or error) of a set
of parameters 0 as the sum of square differences between the
predictions and the observations:

((0 mg): Egg-ﬁg —f(z,- 20))2

We can also think of [(0 : Dg) as the negative of the log-likelihood
of the parameters if we assume that the data has a Gaussian noise
on top of the signal.

A natural way of parameter ﬁtting is to ﬁnd the parameters that
minimize the loss (equivalently, maximize the likelihood):

é =ar min£02D .
g gee®( g)

The method for solving this optimization problem depends on the
choice off. However, in general we can use non-linear optimization
methods, such as conjugate gradient descent, to ﬁnd a solution (in
the worst case, the solution will be only a local minima).

A major problem of using such a model in practice is the
ratio between the number of observations and the number of free
parameters. Since typical time-course experiments consists of few
time points (5—10 points) (Ernst et al., 2005), ﬁtting any non-trivial
model is prone to overﬁtting.

There are multiple ways to avoid overﬁtting. An often used one is
using a prior on the parameters, or similarly, a regularization penalty
(such as L2 or L1 penalization) (Bishop, 1995; Gelman et (11., 1995).
A simple approach to integrate priors is to choose a set of parameters
n that we take to be ‘prototypical’ and a distance ﬁinction dw. Then,
we can deﬁne the penalized loss over parameters as:

2(0 : Dg, n)=zw : Dg)+d,.,(0, 27).

Where the ﬁrst term is the ﬁt error between the predictions and the
observations, and the second term is the penalty for the function’s
parameters compared to the set of prototypical parameters, i.e. the
prior (Fig. lb). The relative contribution of each term to the overall
loss can be set by the weight parameter a), as well as the relative
contribution of each parameter. We discuss how to choose a) in
Section 3.

For this to match our intuition, we require that dw is non-negative
and that dw(x,x)=0. For example, a natural term is a quadratic
distance, where we essentially treat the parameters as though we
have a Gaussian prior.

When we have such a prior, we can use maximum (1 posteriory
estimation (MAP) to ﬁnd the parameters that maximize the posterior:

9g=argmainl(0:Dg,n).

The MAP estimate thus will balance between similarity of the
parameters to the prior parameters n and the ﬁt to the data. This
tradeoff is governed by the weight parameter a) of the distance
ﬁinction dw. If the data supports parameter values that are far from
these in n, the prior will force the parameters to be close to the
prototype. Such regularization helps reduce the effect of noise on
the estimation process and reduces overﬁtting.

While helping us to avoid overﬁtting, the prior, however, biases
our estimates toward the parameters n. To deal with this problem,
we assume that the responses can be divided into groups of genes
with similar responses (Fig. lb). In such a situation, we can assume
that there are several distinct prototypical responses E: (m , ... , up),
each corresponding to a range of responses with similar parameters.
Such a prior is called a mixture prior (Gelman et al., 1995) or a
hierarchical prior (Koller and Friedman, 2009), as it assumes that
the prior involves ﬁrst choosing which class the instance belongs to,
and then choosing the appropriate parameters for that class.

In the mixture prior, given dw and a set of prototypes, we deﬁne
the posterior loss as

[*02Di: ' Zeno,
( gn) 17611111113” gnp)

And similarly deﬁne 98 as the parameters that minimize this loss:
9=ar min min 202D,
g g 0 pe{1,...,P} ( g up)

This minimization problem can be solved by running P (the number
of prototypes) minimization problems, one per prototype.

2.2 An integrative clustering-modeling algorithm

We motivated the use of a mixture prior by the assumption of several
clusters of genes with similar responses, which we represent by
distinct prototypes. When analyzing a dataset, we do not know these
a priori, but rather need to estimate them from the data. This leads
to a classical circular problem, which we solve using an iterative
algorithm that alternates between improving the modeling of genes
and improving the prior (prototypes).

To make the description of the algorithm clearer (Fig. 1c), we
start with initial sets of genes with similar response. From these sets
(clusters) we learn the prototypes. We ﬁt each gene with a model
using these prototypes as the mixture prior. During the ﬁt we learn
the model’s parameters and the prototype that minimize the loss for
each gene (see Section 2.1). Thus we can assign the genes to clusters
according to their typical prototype.

We now explain this formally, starting with some deﬁnitions. We
assume that the dataset consists of multiple sets (clusters). Each gene
has an assignment to its typical prototype denoted pg. A prototype
assignment [3 is a vector of all assignments pg for each gene. Given
[3, the loss of each gene is deﬁned by its loss with respect to the pg .
The total loss of a set of prototypes and prototype assignment is the
sum of the loss of individual genes.

We now can formulate our alternating procedure as step wise
improvement of this objective.

Since each step minimizes the global loss, alternating repeatedly
between these steps will converge to a (potentially local) minima of
the loss function.

We now elaborate on each step:

Cluster step For each gene g we ﬁnd the optimal parameters 0g and
typical prototype pg. The choice of pg is independent of the choice
of prototype assignments to other genes. Thus, for each gene g, we
perform:

0, ' '202D,
( g pg)<—argn}71nmoln ( g up)

This is done using gradient descent search for each value of p.
Note that while optimizing pg we also ﬁnd the parameters 08 that
minimize [* (0 :Dg, ﬁ).

Prototype step Here, we note that the choice of prototype parameters
for each prototype is independent of the choice of other prototypes.
Thus, we want to solve the optimization problem

Using simple but tedious algebraic manipulations, we can show that
this is equivalent to performing the optimization

where ng is the number of genes with pg, and xiﬁg is the value at
time ti for the gene g. Stated differently, we choose the prototype
up to ﬁt the average expression of all genes assigned to prototype
p. This again is a simple optimization in our model.

2.3 Relation to K -means

The procedure we described above is analogous to K -means (Duda
and Hart, 1973). In fact, it is easy to show that K—means is a special
case of this procedure. Suppose we deﬁne the parameter vector to
be a vector of length k (M1, ...,uk) and then deﬁne

[,ti if I = Ii
0 otherwise

f(li0)={

Suppose we use this choice of ‘model’ family, and a quadratic
distance function and the weight vector E where (c1....,ck) with
c > 0. Then, the procedure we describe above reduces to the standard
K -means clustering procedure.

To see this, note that the prototype step reduces to ﬁnding the
centriod of each cluster. Now consider the Cluster step. In this

which is the K -means cluster selection step.

3 THE IMPULSE CLUSTERING APPROACH

We now apply this general framework for a relatively simple model
of temporal gene expression based on the Impulse model (Chechik
and Koller, 2009). This model is designed to capture a two-phase
temporal response by describing an impulse ﬁinction as a product
of two sigmoids: The ﬁrst describes the response onset (dealing
with the stimulus), and the second describes the response offset
(return to a new baseline) (Fig. 1a). The parameters of this model
describe the time of the onset (t1) and the time of the offset (t2),
three amplitude parameters: the height of the original baseline
(ho), peak response (h) and new baseline (I12) and two slope
parameters to models the rate of the onset and the offset (51,52,
respectively).

Formally, given a parameter set 0 = (h0,h1,h2,t1,t2,f31,f32) an
impulse function has the form:

1
f(ti0)= as“:11thoyhl751)‘S(11127h27h152)
where

5(11Imihsiheiﬂ)=hs+(he—hs)m

is a sigmoid that ranges between hs and he with mid-point at time
tm and a slope of ﬂ-sign(he—hs) at time tm (the point of fastest
change).

Our model differs from the original Impulse model of Chechik
and Koller (2009) in several points: (i) We allow different onset
and offset rates, as these rates are governed by different molecular
processes: transcription and RNA degradation; (ii) Responses can
have one or two phases. We require that two-phased responses are
only of the following types: an increase in the expression level
followed by a decrease, or a decrease followed by an increase.

We use this class of models in the generalized K -means procedure
described above with the quadratic distance function.

In our implementation, we start the procedure with initial clusters
obtained from the standard K -means procedure, using Pearson
correlation coefﬁcients as a distance measure.

To learn the number of clusters k and weight vector to, we used
a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, which was repeated
for every pair of potential k and a). In more details, we apply
the algorithm after excluding one randomly chosen time point for
each gene (repeated ﬁve times). For each gene, we calculate the
mean ﬁt error for the missing time point (comparing the predicted
value to the observed value), and the robustness of the assignment
to clusters between the ﬁve repeats. We chose k and a) that

minimized the mean ﬁt error and maximized the robustness to cluster
assignment.

4 EVALUATION ON SYNTHETHIC DATA

To better understand the properties of the Impulse clustering
procedure, we started by examining its behavior on synthetic data
where we know the underlying ‘truth’ and can change various
properties of the data in a controlled manner.

Starting from cluster prototypes we generated data using two types
of variation. First, the amount of variation within each cluster: how
much the parameters of each gene deviate from the prototype it was
generated from (using multiplicative Gaussian noise). Second, the
noise in the data: how much the observed log-ratio expression value
differs from the actual value for the gene (using additive Gaussian
noise). From each prototype we created a set of 110—150 genes
sampled across different time series (Fig. 2a), for each such gene
both the model parameters and its cluster (according to the original
prototype) are known. In this setting, we can test both our modeling
method (prediction on new time points) and clustering method.

We created three different training datasets, all initialized from
three different dynamical prototypes learned on a real dataset [(Amit
et al., 2009), Fig. 3a, Clusters 2—4]. We test each set with different
levels of noise (ranging between stande deviation of 0.1 and 0.5),
while we add constant noise in the parameters and increasing levels
of noise to the data (and vice versa). The three sets are: (i) basic test
set—time series data with 10 sampled time points along 24 h (as in the
original study, Fig. 2a). (ii) Small sample size set: time series data
with six time points along 24h (Fig. 2a). (iii) Nonuniform sampling
set: time series data with ten sampled time points along 24 h, denser
in the early phase of the response (exponential series of time points
from 0.125 to 24 h, Fig. 2a). In addition, for each of these datasets we
created a test set composed of three time points that are not included
in the learning datasets (Fig. 2a).

To test how well we model the dynamics of genes, we run
Impulse clustering on the different training datasets, and calculated
the accuracy of ﬁt of the modeling under the increasing levels of
noise in the datasets. An unbiased measurement of ﬁt is the median
ﬁt error across all genes at time points that were not included in
the training set. Namely, the ﬁt error is the difference between the
generated expression value and the predicted value at those time
points. As a straw-men we used the original impulse model of
Chechik and Koller (2009) and our revised impulse model without
using priors. As we expect, skewed sampling (non-uniform) and
sparse sampling (six time points) increase the error of all methods
(Fig. 2b). Moreover, the error increases with the level of noise on the
data. However, estimates of our method are more robust to increasing
levels of sampling noise in all three scenarios, and less sensitive to
overﬁtting when the data is sparse or noisy (Fig. 2b).

Increasing the variability in the parameter space affects the
Impulse clustering since it makes the clusters more difﬁised.
The two straw-men are less sensitive to this change as they estimate
parameters for each gene separately (Fig. 2c). Yet, on all three sets
the Impulse clustering has smaller error levels compared to the two
straw-men, showing that our method is robust to increasing levels
of noise in the parameters space as well. On the dataset with fewer
time points, Impulse clustering is more accurate than the impulse
model of Chechik and Koller (2009); however, at a high variation
level it is as good as our revised model with no priors. At this level

of variation with relatively small amount of noise in the data, the
prototypes are far from the actual parameters, thus the prior biases
the estimates more than it helps avoid overﬁtting.

An alternative method to evaluate parameter ﬁt, is to compare the
estimated parameters to the true gene parameter. Again, we see that
Impulse clustering performs better than the straw-men. For example,
our peak height h prediction is at least 6 times better, and onset time
prediction t1 is at least 4 times better then the straw-men (Fig. 2c).

In addition, we tested the clustering performance using the
same three datasets, and calculated the accuracy of the clustering
under increasing levels of noise. We measure the accuracy as the
mutual information between the assigned clustering labels for each
gene and the true labels. We compare our method to the stande
K -means clustering (with the same number of clusters) using two
alternative distance measures, the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient and
the Euclidean distance.

The results show that clustering using Impulse clustering are
robust both to nonuniform sampling and to smaller number of
samples, since the error in both sets is very similar to the error on
the basic dataset. On all three datasets, the K -means algorithm with
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient is consistently less accurate. Impulse
clustering has similar performance to the K -means algorithm with
Euclidean distance, with advantage for the latter when the sampling
noise is larger (Fig. 2d and Fig. 2e).

5 TRANSCRIPTIONAL RESPONSE TO
PATHOGEN STIMULI

5.1 Dynamical modules of pathogen response in
primary mice dendtritic cells

We applied our impulse clustering—modeling procedure to time-
course gene expression data in primary mice Dendtritic cells
stimulated by two different pathogen stimuli: lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), a puriﬁed component from Gram-negative Escherichia coli;
and polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (polyIC), a viral-like double-
stranded RNA. The mRNA expression levels were measured at 0.5,
1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 and 24h after stimulation (Amit et al., 2009).
Expression levels are represented as log (base 2) of the ratio to
measurements at time 0. We selected 1293 genes that respond to one
(or both) of the stimulations with at least 2-fold change compared
to time 0.

To create a common set of prototypes for both stimulus, we
applied our clustering algorithm to both datasets together (each
gene was represented twice, once for each stimulus). This resulted
in a set of eight prototypes (Table 1 and Fig. 3a). These types
include: two different primary response dynamics, Cluster 1 and
2 (onset time of 2h, offset time after 12.5 h), which differ mainly
in their expression ratios, whereas Cluster 1 is highly expressed
along the experiment (peak above 3-fold), Cluster 2 has lower

Describing the number of genes in each cluster, and four parameters of each prototype:
the time of the onset (t1), the time of the offset (t2), the height of peak response (h 1)
and the hight of the new baseline (112).

peak expression and returns to the base expression values after a
relatively short time. In addition, there are three different secondary
response dynamics, where Clusters 3 and 4 are both induced (onset
time after 3.7 h), and differ mainly in their offset time (15.5h and
more than 24h, respectfully), while Cluster 7 is repressed with
symmetrical dynamics to these of Cluster 3. We also ﬁnd two
symmetrical late response types (onset after more than 1 1 .5 h), where
Cluster 5 is induced and Cluster 8 repressed. Finally we ﬁnd a low
response dynamic, Cluster 6, describing stimuli speciﬁc genes (i.e.
not responding at all to the other stimuli) or primary response genes
with transient response.

Examining the genes in each of the dynamical response types
we ﬁnd each cluster to be enriched for speciﬁc annotations
(Da Wei Huang and Lempicki, 2008; Dennis Jr et al., 2003) (P < 0.01
after Bonferoni correction), indicating that the dynamical types
represent functionally related sets of genes. Among these we ﬁnd,
for example, enrichment for immune response in various induced
clusters under LPS and polyIC stimuli (but not for the down-
regulated genes), purine nucleotide binding genes are enriched in
the late down-regulated Cluster 3 after polyIC (P <4- 10—5), and
NADP oxidation reduction genes are enriched in the early down-
regulated Cluster 2 genes after polyIC (P <7-10T4). Focusing on
the primary response genes, we ﬁnd in Cluster 1 (high response
genes) enrichment for inﬂammation response (P < 10—8) under LPS
stimuli, and anti-virus response (P < 10—4) under polyIC stimuli.
Interestingly, the primary response genes in Cluster 2, are enriched
for transcription regulatory genes under both stimulus, this response
probably enables the cell to maintain the appropriate transcriptional
response since these primary response genes are down-regulated
faster than the genes in Cluster 1. Among the regulators in Cluster
2 are the master regulator NF-KB and its repressor IKBOl.

The Toll-like signaling pathway, which is a signaling pathway
for pathogen sensing in immune cells, is enriched under both
LPS and polyIC stimulus in the two primary response clusters
(1 and 2). However, zooming in on the genes in the pathway
(Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Kanehisa et al., 2006) (Fig. 3b) under
LPS stimuli, we ﬁnd an interesting division of genes according
to these two dynamical types: the end effector genes in the
pathways (inﬂammatory cytokines leading to pro-inﬂammatory and
chemotactic effects) are mainly genes with high response levels
(Cluster 1), such as the pro-inﬂammatory factor Il-6 and Tnfot. While

along the signaling pathway we ﬁnd mainly genes with fast offset
and lower response level (Cluster 2), such as the adaptor protein
MyD88, the MAPK signaling pathway, and the J AK-STAT signaling
pathway. Moreover, under the polyIC stimuli this division of genes
into two groups is less deﬁned (Fig. 3b), however, while most genes
along the signaling pathway belong to Cluster 2, the main polyIC
receptor Tlr3 is reversely associated with Clsuster 1.

We next asked whether the dynamical clusters represent sets of
coregulated genes and how is this regulation done. For this end, we
focused on transcription factor mediated regulation, and applied the
Allegro motif discovery algorithm (Halperin et al., 2009) on each
set of genes, ﬁnding motifs enriched in the promoters of each set
compared to the rest of the genome. For each set we found at least
one signiﬁcantly enriched motif (P < 10—10), thus strengthening the
biological relevance of the clusters and their coregulation. Several
of the motifs are similar to motifs of known regulators (Matys
et al., 2006) involved in the complex transcriptional response to LPS
(Amit et al., 2009), which led us to suggest the following regulation
scheme. Cluster 1 (primary response) is regulated by the factors
NF-KB and STAT1/5/6, Cluster 2 (primary response) is regulated by
the factor NFKB, Cluster 3 (early secondary response) is regulated
by the factors NFKB and Irf1/2, and Cluster 5 (secondary response)
is regulated by the factors STAT1/4. In the other clusters, we ﬁnd
motifs similar to motifs of known factors that were previously not
indicated to be involved in these signaling pathways, and thus we
have less evidence for their functionality, such as Egr1/2/3-like, Spl-
like and -PPAR-erot-like motif regulating Cluster 7, and Gcnf—like
motif regulating Cluster 8. Although this is a simpliﬁed regulatory
scheme, it points out differences in the regulation programs of each
clusters that can lead to the various dynamical response types we
observe.

Since several clusters often share the same gene annotations, we
wanted to test which parameters characterize the different genesets.
For each of the genesets that contain at least 10 genes in our response
(474 sets), we tested if it is characterized by a speciﬁc parameter
(i.e. onset time, offset time, peak and steady state hight), using a
Kolmogorov—Smimov test comparing the distribution of a parameter
in our gene set of interest compared to the rest of the genes in
the response. We ﬁnd that 15.2% of the sets are characterized by a
speciﬁc range of parameters (P < 0.005), where the most meaningful
parameter was the peak of the response h (for 11.4% of the sets),
and to a smaller extent the onset time t1 (3%), the offset time (2.3%)
and ﬁnally the hight of the steady state (1.7%). For example, the
cytokine genes Fig. 3c are characterized by an early onset time,
and high peak and steady state levels, while the genes in the NOD-
like receptor signaling pathway (detecting various pathogens and
generating innate immune responses, Fig. 3c) are characterized by
a fast onset time only.

5.2 Comparing two stimuli

An advantage of Impulse clustering is that it provides an easy
way to compare between different transcriptional responses. We
can apply our method simultaneously to different time series data,
and test for each gene, not only in which of the responses is it
involved, but also compare its dynamical expression proﬁle across
conditions. Note that since we model the expression of each gene
by a continuous function, we can compare experiments measuring
different time points. We compared between the response to LPS

their dynamical response in a similar manner and characterized
them by enrichments of gene annotations (hypergeometeric P-value
with Bonferroni correction). Interestingly, the 286 genes that are
classiﬁed as primary response genes (Clusters 1 or 2) in LPS and
secondary response in polyIC (Clusters 3 or 4) are enriched for
immune response genes (P<2><10T5), signaling cascade genes
(P < 6 X 10—4), and positive regulation of apoptosis (P < 9 X 10—3).
While the genes that maintain their cluster assignment in Cluster
1 are enriched for immune response (P < 8 X 10—5) and anti-viral
response (P<9 ><10_3), and these that remain in Cluster 2, are
enriched for transcription regulation (P < 6 X 10—4).

We can conduct a more detailed comparison by comparing a
gene’s model parameters between both stimuli. We compared each
parameter across all genes, and found that the response to polyIC is
lower and slower on average: 23% of the genes responding to polyIC
have lower peak values compared to their response to the LPS stimuli
(a difference of 1-fold at least), 20% have a delayed onset time (in
at least 2h, with mean delay of 4.8 h) and 50% have delayed offset
time (in at least 2h, with mean delay of 9.5 h). For example, the
inﬂammation response regulator Tnf has a lower expression ratio
in response to polyIC compared to LPS (Fig. 4b), the gene Fabp3
has a delayed response to polyIC (Fig. 4c), and the chemokine gene
Cxc110 has a similar dynamical response to both stimuli (Fig. 4d).

6 DISCUSSION

Time-series expression data are a valuable approach to study the
dynamics of the transcriptional response to a stimuli. Here, we

provide tools to address the challenge of analyzing such complex
data. Our DynaMiteC method is an integrative approach where we
use a simple two impulse model (Chechik and Koller, 2009) to
describe the response dynamics, and at the same time cluster the
data so that every cluster captures a group of genes with similar
dynamics. By exploiting the fact that most responses contain groups
of co-regulated genes with a similar behavior, we can estimate a set
of prototypical responses in our function space, and use them as
a meaningful prior when estimating the parameters for individual
genes. As a consequence our method avoids overﬁtting and is
more robust to measurement noise while still ﬁtting each gene with
speciﬁc parameters. In addition we cluster the genes into meaningful
dynamical clusters, according to the typical prototype (prior) we
learn for each gene. We validated our results ﬁrst on synthetic data,
demonstrating our robustness to noise, to a small number of samples,
and to non-uniform sampling.

To demonstrate the properties of our method we applied
DynaMiteC to a dataset describing the response to two related but
distinct stimuli of immune cells. As we show the resulting clusters
capture distinct parts of the immune response that represent separate
biological functions and are regulated by different overlapping
cis-regulatory motifs. Moreover, we show that the estimated model
parameters are biologically meaningful and allow us to provide a
ﬁner description of the differences between the two stimuli.

Taken more broadly, we apply the general theme of parameter
‘sharing’ between genes to reduce overﬁtting when estimating the
dynamics at the level of each gene. This theme can be realized

in many different ways. We show a general approach that can be
applied, while we are choosing to use a quadratic loss ﬁinction on
measurement noise. Such a loss ﬁinction is the one most commonly
used in analysis of gene expression data, and thus is a natural ﬁt
for this domain. We focused here on a speciﬁc parametric family
of functions that provide a good tradeoff between simplicity and ﬁt
to typical observed responses, while enjoying the beneﬁts of using
a function with biologically meaningful parameters. However, the
approach can be applied to any family of functions depending on
the desired application.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The discovery of CRISPR-Gas systems almost 20 years
ago rapidly changed our perception of the bacterial and archaeal
immune systems. CRISPR loci consist of several repetitive DNA
sequences called repeats, inter-spaced by stretches of variable
length sequences called spacers. This CRISPR array is transcribed
and processed into multiple mature RNA species (chNAs). A single
chNA is integrated into an interference complex, together with
CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, to bind and degrade invading nu-
cleic acids. Although existing bioinformatics tools can recognize
CRISPR loci by their characteristic repeat-spacer architecture, they
generally output CRISPR arrays of ambiguous orientation and thus
do not determine the strand from which chNAs are processed.
Knowledge of the correct orientation is crucial for many tasks, includ-
ing the classification of CRISPR conservation, the detection of leader
regions, the identiﬁcation of target sites (protospacers) on invading
genetic elements and the characterization of protospacer-adjacent
motifs.

Results: We present a fast and accurate tool to determine the chNA-
encoding strand at CRISPR loci by predicting the correct orientation
of repeats based on an advanced machine learning approach. Both
the repeat sequence and mutation information were encoded and
processed by an efficient graph kernel to learn higher-order correl-
ations. The model was trained and tested on curated data comprising
>4500 CRISPRs and yielded a remarkable performance of 0.95 AUC
ROC (area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic). In
addition, we show that accurate orientation information greatly im-
proved detection of conserved repeat sequence families and structure
motifs. We integrated CRISPRstrand predictions into our CRISPRmap
web server of CRISPR conservation and updated the latter to version
2.0.

1 INTRODUCTION

CRISPR-Cas immune systems of bacteria and archaea provide
adaptive defence against a variety of invading genetic elements.
They have been classiﬁed into three major classes: Types 1, II and
111, where Type 11 systems are conﬁned to bacteria (Makarova
et al., 2011a; Vestergaard et al., 2014). The adaptive immune

response of all types is divided into three major phases: (i) adap-
tation, the uptake of DNA fragments from genetic elements and
their insertion between consecutive repeats of a CRISPR array,
generally adjacent to a leader sequence; (ii) processing of the
CRISPR array transcripts within the repeats to generate small
chNAs that derive from part or all of each spacer region and
(iii) interference involving targeting and cleavage of an invading
genetic element, or its transcripts, by Cas proteinerNA
complexes (Barrangou and van der 00st, 2013, and Fig. 1).
Whereas the adaptation phase is relatively conserved in the dif-
ferent CRISPR-Cas systems, signiﬁcant differences occur in the
processing and interference mechanisms. Thus, where Type I and
III systems employ a Cas6 processing endonuclease to cleave
within the repeats, the bacterial Type II system uses the host-
encoded RNase III, together with a CRISPR-associated, trans-
encoded trachNA (Deltcheva et al., 2011). Furthermore, the
various interference complexes exhibit considerable diversity
(Barrangou and van der 00st, 2013; Makarova et al., 2011a;
Vestergaard et al., 2014).

We developed an efﬁcient tool for determining the strand from
which mature chNAs are derived by focussing on the repeats at
CRISPR loci. The repeats are unique within the CRISPR-Cas
system because they are the only element to play a Vital role in all
phases of immunity (Barrangou and van der 00st, 2013). Thus,
despite their relatively short lengths, each repeat carries essential
structural parameters or sequence motifs that are recognized by
enzymes or structural proteins involved in adaptation, chNA
biogenesis and interference. Paradoxically, however, the repeats
are very heterogeneous, occurring in a range of lengths, 1948 nt,
and display considerable sequence diversity. An early compara-
tive study of CRISPR diversity yielded 12 main clusters with
speciﬁc sequence characteristics; only a subset folded into char-
acteristic hairpin structure motifs (Kunin et al., 2007). More
recently, a major reevaluation of CRISPR conservation was exe-
cuted by Lange et a]. (2013), on a much larger data set of 3527
CRISPRs, where 40 conserved repeat sequence families were
identiﬁed together with a total of 33 potential structural
motifs. The repeat clusters were further classiﬁed into six super-
classes, some of which showed strong biases to speciﬁc CRISPR
subtypes and to certain bacterial or archaeal phyla (Lange et al.,
2013).

CRISPR loci are generally identiﬁed by their characteristic
repeat-spacer architecture. For example CRT (Bland et al.,
2007) and CRISPRFinder (Grissa et al., 2007) provide sensitive
predictions of CRISPR arrays, but do not provide unambiguous
orientation information. In the literature, orientation is derived

Fig. 1. The three major phases of CRISPR-Cas immune systems. First, in
the adaptation phase, Cas proteins excise the protospacer sequence from
foreign DNA and insert it into the repeat, adjacent to the leader at the
CRISPR locus. Second, CRISPR arrays are transcribed and then
processed into multiple chNAs, each carrying a single spacer sequence
and part of the adjoining repeat sequence. Third, at the interference
phase, the chNAs are assembled into different classes of protein target-
ing complexes (Cascades) that anneal to, and cleave, spacer matching
sequences on either invading element or their transcripts

mainly by characteristic sequence motifs in the repeat, the detec-
tion of a conserved leader region in closely related CRISPR loci
or by transcriptome experiments where the dominantly tran-
scribed strand is determined. However, to date very few systems
have been studied experimentally, and many large-scale studies
require accurate orientation information for all available
CRISPR arrays. Recently, Biswas et a]. (2014) has presented
the ﬁrst tool to predict the orientation of CRISPR arrays.
Their model is essentially a linear predictor based on a number
of features which comprise the presence of the ATTGAAAN
motif in repeats, a higher A or T content in the ﬂanking regions
of CRISPR arrays, nucleotide composition within the CRISPR
array, the presence of mutations in speciﬁc parts of the array and
the tendency to fold into a secondary structure. Each feature is
considered as an independent predictor and is given a weight
proportional to its estimated precision. The final prediction is
computed as the weighted combination of each predictor.

Knowledge of the correct repeat orientation is crucial for ac-
curate characterization of CRISPR conservation and for subse-
quently studying mechanisms of adaptation, CRISPR RNA
processing and interference. In particular, it can help to (i)
detect leader regions, currently poorly described in the literature;
(ii) identify signals of transcription initiation and termination;
(iii) determine the orientation of protospacers on invading
genetic elements; and ﬁnally, (iv) characterize cognate protospa-
cer-adjacent motifs (PAMs). Thus, we consider that the repeat
orientation tool presented here will be of critical importance for
future CRISPR-based experimental studies.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

We present a linear discriminative model based on graph kernels to
accurately predict the orientation of the CRISPR sequence. The
method ﬁrst generates a sequence alignment of all repeat instances in
the CRISPR array and outputs the consensus repeat sequence in its pre-
dicted orientation and whether it lies on the forward or reverse strand.
There are two core ideas underlying our approach. The ﬁrst one is to use
a combinatorial technique to extract a very large number of features. The
second idea is to encode our knowledge about the problem as a directed

graph with discrete labels. The ﬁrst idea allows a predictive system to be
very accurate and to express complex discriminative decisions; the second
idea allows a natural and ﬂexible encoding of background knowledge.

2.1 Novel comprehensive identiﬁcation of CRISPR loci

We extracted a comprehensive dataset of CRISPR loci from published
archaeal and bacterial genomes. All genome sequences were downloaded
from the NCBI website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). We predicted
CRISPR loci using CRISPRFinder (Grissa et al., 2007) and CRT
(Bland et al., 2007). For both tools, we used (i) default parameter
values for predicted CRISPR loci and (ii) parameters that corresponded
to at least two repeats within a CRISPR locus; repeat and spacer lengths
were set to a range between 18 and 78 bp. We then (iii) generated a
consensus repeat for each CRISPR locus exploiting the fact that repeats
within a CRISPR locus are almost completely identical with some loci
that carry few mutations, preferably at the start and end (see
Supplementary Figure S3, Supplementary material). Because CRT does
not output consensus repeats, we used the MAFFT program (Katoh
et al., 2002), version 6.4., to compute the multiple alignments and the
Cons program from EMBOSS package (Rice et al., 2000) to obtain the
consensus repeat from the multiple sequence alignments. Finally, (iv) the
results from both CRISPRFinder and CRT tools were merged and re-
dundant CRISPR loci were removed. In this way, we obtained a CRISPR
databases with >4700 consensus repeats, which we refer to as REPEATS
(see Table 1 for details).

2.2 Datasets from literature

2.2.] Set of repeats from Lange et a]. (2013) We selected struc-
tural motifs that ﬁt to known cleavage sites (Lange et al., 2013). Table 2
gives a summary of published CRISPR-Cas systems with experimental
evidence for the processing mechanism which we refer to as
REPEATSLMge. This dataset contains 324 bacterial and 118 archaeal
repeat sequences (442 in total).

2.2.2 Set of repeats from Kum'n et a]. (2007) We denote the
dataset originally published in Kunin et al. (2007) as REPEATSKWM.
The dataset contains 327 bacterial and 92 archaeal repeat sequences
(419 in total). The orientations were assigned by the authors using pre-
viously published sequence features.

2.2.3 Set of archaeal repeats from Shah and Garrett (201]) We
denote the dataset based on the results available in (Shah and Garrett,
2011) as REPEATSShah. This dataset contains 478 archaeal repeat
sequences with manually verified strand orientation.

2.3 Encoding CRISPR repeats as graphs

The features used to discriminate between the different orientation are
based on available biological knowledge of CRISPR evolution and pro-
cessing. During CRISPR RNA processing by Cas6-like endoribonu-
cleases, cleavage occurs either at the 3’-end base of the hairpin motif,
or within the double-stranded region of the hairpin stern, usually below
a C —> G base pair (Barrangou and van der Oost, 2013; Richter et al.,
2012; Scholz et al., 2013). The product of this cleavage is an 8-nt-long
AUUGAAA(N) repeat tag at the S’-end of the mature chNA (S’-tag),
which corresponds to the last eight nucleotides from the 3’-end of the
repeat sequence. Kunin et al. (2007) and Lange et al. (2013) showed that
in some cases the four nucleotides AAA(N) motif can be used to identify
the orientation. These observations lead to the hypothesis that the
terminal region of the sequence, comprising four or eight nucleotides,
plays a key role. We observed also that the mutation rate in various
parts of the CRISPR locus is non-uniform, in particular the middle
part of the CRISPR locus is more conserved. This ﬁnding motivated

the idea of using the presence of mutations as an additional signal to
detect the predominantly transcribed strand.

We made use of this background knowledge to partition the consensus
repeat into speciﬁc informative parts: we distinguish terminal regions of
identical size k at both ends (as the correct orientation is unknown) and a
central variable length area. The terminal sequences are further parti-
tioned into P equally sized parts, where we expect to ﬁnd key motifs.
We call each part block. One of the main signals that we used to deﬁne the
number and size of the blocks is the mutation rate, deﬁned as the fraction
of mutations per nucleotide in each block. In Supplementary Figure S3,
we report the mutation rate for the CRISPR locus partitioning with
k = 8 and P = 2 on a dataset of 897 CRISPR arrays (Kunin et al.,
2007; Shah and Garrett, 2011): each repeat is split into ﬁve adjacent

regions, with terminal blocks spanning exactly 4 nucleotides and a central
block spanning 12 nucleotides on average. In these settings, we observed a
highly signiﬁcant 4-fold and a 16-fold increase in the mutation rate in the
initial 8 nucleotides and in the terminal block, respectively, as compared
to the middle block. In Section 3.1, we have further validated the opti-
mality of this partitioning with in silico simulations.

We encoded all our intuitions and knowledge on the relevant signals
that a predictive model should be aware of in a graph data structure. The
reason for this choice is 2-fold. First, we want an easy and natural way to
inject different types of information in the problem solution, and, second,
we want to exploit efficient techniques developed in the Machine
Learning literature to automatically construct a large number of derived
features to improve the accuracy of predictive models.

The graph formalism allows us, in a very natural and ﬂexible way, to
add knowledge by inserting informative entities as vertices and connect-
ing them to the relevant parts of the current encoding via the edge notion.
In our case, the information provided by the consensus sequence is mod-
elled directly as a path graph with vertices labelled with the consensus
nucleotide code (see Fig. 2). We then model the global localization infor-
mation as additional vertices with a label that indicates the block identity.
This reveals whether a nucleotide is located at the very beginning or just
near the beginning of the sequence (and symmetrically for the opposite
end). Furthermore, we consider a more ﬁne grained localization informa-
tion, identifying the speciﬁc position of a nucleotide within a block. The
reason to encode an increasingly reﬁned localization information is to
allow the algorithm to choose the optimal level of detail needed in various
parts of the sequence. Finally, the main piece of information is whether
there is evidence of a mutation at a speciﬁc location; we model this with
an additional vertex labelled with a binary code to indicate the presence
of a mutation in at least one of the repeated sequences.

Fig. 2. Graph encoding the consensus repeat sequence. The consensus nucleotide information is represented as a path graph, and additional information
is modelled as a chain of additional vertices. The terminal parts of the repeat are marked with block identiﬁers

The ﬁnal modelling decision regards the topology of the graph, i.e.
how the additional vertices, which encode the different types of informa-
tion, should be connected together. We identify an order which reﬂects
the importance of the different types of information, starting from the
nucleotide type, the block ID, the mutation evidence and ﬁnally the rela-
tive position within a block. Note that the combinatorial feature gener-
ation phase is affected by the sequential order of these attributes, as the
information that is ranked higher will participate in the generation of
more features and will therefore be regarded as more prominent.

2.4 Predictive model and feature extraction

After having encoded domain expert knowledge as a graph, we need to
process this type of structured data to induce a predictive model. We do
this using the technique developed by Costa and Grave (2010), based on
the notion of graph kernels. The core idea (see Supplementary
Information for a formal description) is to decompose each graph in a
(multi) set of fragments and use these as features, in a similar fashion to
what is done in the chemoinforrnatics domain with the ﬁngerprint tech-
nique. The resulting sparse vectors can then be processed by efﬁcient
machine learning techniques, such as the stochastic gradient descent
SVM (Bottou, 2010), to yield fast and highly predictive models. The
type of graph decomposition that we use is called Neighbourhood
Subgraph Pairwise Distance Kernel (NSPDK), and it involves the extrac-
tion of all possible pairs of small neighbourhood subgraphs that are not
too distant (see Fig. 3). Intuitively one can think about this type of
decomposition as an upgrade of the concept of k-mers with gaps from
the domain of strings to that of graphs. Both the extraction of the features
and the training of the predictive model have linear complexity and offer
therefore excellent scaling capability. More precisely, extracting all
neighbourhood subgraphs is achieved with a breadth-ﬁrst visit for a
limited depth starting from each node, and as the graphs are sparse, it
takes O(|n >l< ml) where n is the number of nucleotides and m the number
of repeat alignments.

Finally, given that one of the two strands can be the one that exhibits a
characteristic pattern, we train a predictive model on both variants of
each repeat sequence: one obtained from the forward strand and the
other from the complementary reverse strand. The binary task is there-
fore to assign a positive score to the sequences that are transcribed and a
negative one to the complementary strand. In the predictive phase, we
enforce consistency by considering the prediction on both variants of the
sequence: a strong conﬁdence of the prediction of the forward strand
should also correspond to an equally conﬁdent prediction that the reverse
complementary sequence is not transcribed. To do so, we simply perform
the individual predictions and then average the prediction of the forward
strand with the opposite prediction for the reverse strand. If the resulting
score is positive, then the forward strand is predicted to be transcribed,
whereas the reverse strand is selected if the score is negative.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Parameter selection

We have previously described how relevant biological knowledge
was used to determine various modelling choices. The proposed
model admits, however, different conﬁgurations both in the
encoding part as well as in the combinatorial feature generation
part. To determine the best conﬁguration, we therefore per-
formed extensive in silico simulations. More speciﬁcally, the
encoding phase allows the following parametric variants: (i)
choice of attribute type (i.e. whether to use the mutation infor-
mation or the block identity); (ii) choice of attribute order (i.e.
whether the block identifier should precede the mutation marker
or Vice versa); (iii) size of the terminal regions (more, equal or less
than 8 nucleotides); (iv) number of blocks within the terminal
regions (1, 2 or 3). The combinatorial feature construction phase
is parametrized instead by the maximal radius R and distance D,
where larger values for R translates in more complex features
and larger values for D in an increased tolerance for larger gaps.

For each model variant, we designed a selection experiment to
identify the best conﬁguration of parameters as the one that
achieves the minimum expected predictive error. Not surpris-
ingly, results are consistent with the background knowledge
that originally motivated the encoding, that is, the best model
uses all attributes in the order presented in Figure 2 with terminal
regions of size 8 nucleotides divided into blocks of 4 nucleotides.
We observed that the actual attribute order had just a modest
inﬂuence on the results (see Supplementary Table S1).

3.1.] Choice of attribute type We estimated the expected pre-
diction error of ﬁve different encodings, which use an increasing
amount of information. We denote them with model,- with
ie {1,2,3,4,5} (consider Fig. 2 as a reference). In all cases
blocks have a constant size of 4 nucleotides.

Fig. 3. The NSPDK approach extracts a large number of features taking only speciﬁc fragments into account. The procedure is parametrized by the
radius R and the distance D. Each vertex is considered in turn as a root. A neighbourhood graph of radius R is extracted around each root. All possible
pairs of neighbourhood graphs of the same size R are considered, provided that their respective roots are exactly at distance D. To understand the
importance of the sequential order of the attributes consider the left part of the ﬁgure: here we depict a feature with radius 1 and distance 0, which will
encode three pieces of information: (i) the speciﬁc dinucleotide combination, (ii) the block ID and (iii) whether a mutation is likely to occur on the ﬁrst
nucleotide of the dinucleotide. As we increase the maximal distance between the roots in the pair, the encoded information is further specialized. In the
middle part of the ﬁgure, we show a feature that additionally includes the presence of a mutation at distance 5. When the radius is increased to 2, the

speciﬁc position within the block is also considered

To evaluate the generalization capacity of the resulting predictive
models, we used as training material the 442 sequences
in REPEATSLange and as test material the 419
REPEATSKmn + 478 sequences REPEATSSW, ﬁltered so as to
guarantee a maximal pre—specified level of sequence identity w.r.t.
the training material. In Figure 4, we report the area under the
curve for the receiver operator characteristic (AUC ROC) when
the test material has pairwise sequence identity 50.95, 0.85, 0.75
and 0.65, respectively, as measured by the NeedelmaneWunsch
algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970).

The simulations show that the mutation information does
indeed provide good discriminative features (increasing perform-
ance of 5%) and that partitioning the sequence into blocks can
further improve the predictive performance (an extra 10%).
Finally, the model is shown to yield ~0.85 AUC ROC when
tested on sequences with only 0.65 sequence identity, indicating
a reasonable generalization capacity to evolutionary distant se-
quences. Note that extrapolating the predictive tendency with a
quadratic ﬁt, we get a random AUC ROC of 0.53 at 25% se-
quence similarity, i.e. for random sequences.

3.1.2 Choice of terminal region size We validated the notion of
a most informative leading part of the consensus repeat sequence
Via an in silico simulation. An encoding was created that uses
only three blocks: two terminal ones of ﬁxed size k nucleotides
and a central one of variable length. We computed the average
AUC ROC in a 10-fold cross validation for k = 1, . . . , 10. Results
shown in Supplementary Figure S1 are in striking agreement
with our biological knowledge, with clear performance peaks
at exactly 4 and 8 nucleotides.

3.1.3 Choice of number of blocks within the terminal regions We
also validated the notion that there is an advantage in consider-
ing a finer partition of the terminal parts. We started from an
encoding with terminal regions spanning 8 nucleotides and then
we subdivided them into 1, 2 or 4 equal sized subparts, that is, in
subparts of 8, 4 and 2 nucleotides. Once again results (shown in
Supplementary Figure S2) are in agreement with the biological
ﬁndings, and confirm that a subdivision in 4 nucleotide parts is
indeed beneﬁcial.

3.1.4 Combinatorial features The complexity of the derived fea-
ture representation depends on the maximum radius R and max-
imum distance D that are considered. Using models, we
simulated all possible combinations of values R = {0, . . . , 7}

that, unsurprisingly, the optimal size R = 3 is also the minimal
size that allows to capture all available attributes in models.

3.2 Comparison with Biswas et al. (2014)

We used the same dataset as in Biswas et al. (2014) to train our
model. Both methods were then applied to the REPEATSShah
data set, ﬁltered for decreasing levels of sequence identity w.r.t.
the training set. In Figure 5 we report the comparative AUC
ROC performance and observe that our proposal offers a sub-
stantial improvement both in prediction performance and in gen-
eralization capacity with a less pronounced degradation as the
sequence identity decreases.

Finally, we measured the runtime for both approaches on 956
CRISPR repeat arrays (average length 28 nucleotides). The clas-
sification task was completed in 59s by our approach and in
37 min by the Biswas predictive model. We report that the
Biswas tool failed to make any prediction in 98 cases out of

only slightly more difﬁcult to predict.

3.3 CRISPR-Cas system annotation

We used our orientation prediction method to identify the tran-
scribed strand for the set of 3527 repeats available from Lange
et al. (2013) and for the novel set of 4719 individual CRISPR loci
identiﬁed as described in Section 2.1. This material was ﬁnally
used to update the CRISPRmap web server, which provides an
automated and easy-to-use classiﬁcation of all currently available
and newly sequenced CRISPRs.

3.3.1 Re—correcting the orientation of 3527 repeats from Lange
et al. (2013) Our tool was run on 3527 repeats, which were
then clustered into 40 conserved sequence families, 33 potential
structural motifs and 6 major superclasses. In this set, we identi-
fied 536 repeats with incorrect orientation (see Supplementary
Table S12). Next we ran our cluster pipeline for three iterations,
retrieving 29 potential structural motifs and 37 conserved se-
quences families (see Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). As
shown in Figure 6, the orientation of F8 and M6 was incorrect.
Using corrected orientations, we could merge F8 with F6, and
M5 with M6. Overall, in Figure 6, we show how the cluster
quality can be signiﬁcantly improved when we can make use of
a better orientation prediction.

3.3.2 Update of CRISPRmap web server to version 2.0 The
database REPEATS of 4719 individual CRISPR loci was col-
lected performing an exhaustive search for CRISPR loci within
all available bacterial and archaeal genomes (see Table 1). We
developed two independent clustering approaches to identify
structural motifs and conserved sequence families. In both
approaches, we call a cluster of structural motifs or conserved
sequences a class if they contain CRISPR repeats which come
from 10 different species (see Supplementary Tables SiSll and
CRISPRmap). The results of our independent clustering
approaches are as follows: (i) 18 structure motifs were identiﬁed
based on sequence and structure alignments using LocARNA
(Smith et al., 2010; Will et al., 2007, 2012). Structure motif can-
didates were constrained to be similar to those previously pub-
lished (Brouns et al., 2008; Hatoum—Aslan et al., 2011; Nam
et al., 2012; Nickel et al., 2013; Sashital et al., 2011; Scholz
et al., 2013; Sternberg et al., 2012). (ii) Twenty-four conserved
sequence families were identiﬁed based on Markov clustering
(Enright et al., 2002). Full details of structure motifs and con-
served sequence families are available in the Supplementary ﬁle
and in full on CRISPRmap web server. We grouped all the se-
quences available in the REPEATS database into six major
superclasses (labelled A to F) based on sequence and structure
similarities and tree topology (Supplementary Figure S6). Owing
to the corrected orientation, there are two main differences be-
tween superclasses from Lange et al. (2013) and current super-
classes. First, superclasses B and C were merged together and the

Fig. 6. (A) Given the novel predicted orientation Family 5 with Family 8 and Motif 4 with Motif 6 could be merged. (B) The 33 structural motifs from

resulting new superclass was called B. Second, parts of super-
classes E and F were moved to superclass D (Supplementary
Figure S6).

Archaea CRISPR-Cas subtype annotation from Vestergaard
et al. (2014) A very recent study has classiﬁed archaeal
CRISPR-Cas systems into two main types, called Type I and
Type III and 12 subtypes (Vestergaard et al., 2014). We anno-
tated all archaea CRISPR loci based on these subtypes. For
genomes which became available after this study was completed,
we annotated them following the procedure employed in the cas
gene cassette study (V estergaard et al., 2014). To assign subtypes
to speciﬁc CRISPR loci automatically, we first identiﬁed the
distance of the closest cas gene cassette subtype to each
CRISPR locus. Second, we plotted the distances and determined
a clear peak (Supplementary Figure S9 in Supplementary
Material). Finally, we used the peak as a cut-off to assign
CRISPR-Cas subtypes to speciﬁc CRISPR loci.

CRISPR-Cas subtype annotation from Makarova et al.
(2011) We extracted all genes from all available bacterial gen-
omes. We then searched for all cas genes using a recent version of
TIGRFAM models from Haft et al. (2005, 2013) in combination
with HMMER (Eddy, 2011). A cas gene was annotated when
one of its respective models was found with an E-Value 5 0.0001.
Next, we took the results and searched them against protein
family databases CDD (Makarova et al., 2011a), COG
(Makarova et al., 2006) and Pfam (Punta et al., 2012) using
RPS-Blast (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2011). Then, we generated
new models and supermodels from those databases. Finally, we
used the new models to annotate all cas genes based on
Makarova et al. (2011a,b) classiﬁcation. We assigned cas subtype
to CRISPR loci in the same way as in the previous subsection.

4 CONCLUﬁON

We presented a highly ﬂexible approach to accurately predict the
transcribed strand of CRISPR loci. The method is motivated by
recent ﬁndings and encodes the most relevant information in the
form of a graph structure that can be efﬁciently processed with
graph kernel methods. Our tool compares favourably against a
recent approach proposed in Biswas et al. (2014) in terms of
accuracy (0.95 compared to 0.88 AUC ROC), runtimes (59 s
rather than 37min on a 1K sequences dataset) and coverage
(we achieve 0.89 AUC ROC on the 10% sequences that the
Biswas tool fails to classify).

Our approach was integrated in CRISPRmap (Lange et al.,
2013) to improve the accuracy of the previously published clas-
sification of CRISPRs, and resulted in: (i) a comprehensive data-
set with >4500 consensus repeats; (ii) the most recent
classiﬁcation of Cas subtypes based on Cas-protein occurrences
for archaea (V estergaard et al., 2014); and (iii) an improved an-
notation of Makarova Cas subtypes for bacteria respecting the
rules published in Makarova et al. (2011a).

The orientation prediction approach that we have presented is
fast, accurate and can be easily integrated in existing pipelines. In
future work, we will employ it to ease the identiﬁcation of novel
targets (protospacers), PAM motifs and the investigation of
regulatory motifs in the leader sequences of CRISPR arrays.

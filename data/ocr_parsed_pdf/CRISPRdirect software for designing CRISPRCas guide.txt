Abstract

Summary: CRISPRdirect is a simple and functional web server for selecting rational CRISPR/Cas
targets from an input sequence. The CRISPR/Cas system is a promising technique for genome en—
gineering which allows target—specific cleavage of genomic DNA guided by Cas9 nuclease in com—
plex with a guide RNA (gRNA), that complementarily binds to a ~20 nt targeted sequence. The tar—
get sequence requirements are twofold. First, the 5’—NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)
sequence must be located adjacent to the target sequence. Second, the target sequence should be
specific within the entire genome in order to avoid off—target editing. CRISPRdirect enables users to
easily select rational target sequences with minimized off—target sites by performing exhaustive
searches against genomic sequences. The server currently incorporates the genomic sequences of
human, mouse, rat, marmoset, pig, chicken, frog, zebrafish, Ciona, fruit fly, silkworm,
Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis, rice, Sorghum and budding yeast.

1 Introduction

Genome engineering is a promising technique to manipulate en—
dogenous chromosomal DNA in a site—specific manner. A novel sys—
tem that employs the prokaryotic immune defense system based on
the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(CRISPR) and CRISPR—associated (Cas) protein has been reported
as a prominent genome engineering approach (Cho et (11., 2013;
Cong et (11., 2013; Jinek et (11., 2013; Mali et (11., 2013). Recent stud—
ies utilize the RNA—guided endonuclease Cas9 from Streptococcus
pyogenes and a guide RNA (gRNA), which acts as a guide to define
the target site to introduce DNA double—stranded break. A remark—
able advantage of the CRISPR/Cas system is that the target DNA se—
quence is recognized by simple base—pairing complementarity by the
gRNA. Thus, the CRISPR/Cas system can be programmed only by
changing the gRNA sequence, and the synthesis of the gRNA for

targeting a specific gene is easy at low cost. However, it should be a
critical issue to avoid the cleavage of the unintended off—target
genes, since double—stranded break results in stable and heritable
modification of the genome.

In this study, we present CRISPRdirect (http://crispr.dbcls.jp/l,
which provides efficient selection of CRISPR/Cas target sites with
reduced numbers of potential off—target candidates. CRISPRdirect
investigates the entire genome for perfect matches with each candi—
date target sequence (20 mer) and their seed sequence (12 or 8 mer)
ﬂanking the PAM. Users can also browse the detailed list of poten—
tial off—target sites that have partial complementarity with the
selected sequence. The server incorporates genomic sequences of
human, mouse, rat, marmoset, pig, chicken, frog, zebrafish, Ciona,
fruit ﬂy, silkworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis, rice,

Sorghum and budding yeast. Currently, several web servers are
available for designing CRISPR/Cas gRNAs (Supplementary Table
S1). CRISPR Design (Hsu et 41]., 2013; Ran et 41]., 2013) performs
gRNA selection from an input sequence up to 250 bp, and gRNAs
are scored based on predicted off—target interactions. E—CRISP
(Heigwer et 41]., 2014) ranks gRNAs according to on—target specifi—
city and number of off—targets. E—CRISP, ZiFiT (Sander et 41].,
2010), Cas9 Design (Ma et 41]., 2013) and CHOPCHOP (Montague
et 41]., 2014) utilize Bowtie (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) to per—
form off—target searches allowing mismatches. On the other hand,
DNA2.0 gRNA Design Tool (https://www.dna20.com/eCommerce/
startCas9) searches for perfect matches with 12 nt seed to identify
off—target sites. These servers except CRISPR Design and ZiFiT can
process at least 10 kbp of input sequence. Web servers for checking
off—target sites for given 20 nt sequences are also available, such
as Cas—OFFinder (Bae et 41]., 2014) and GGGenome (http://
GGGenome.dbcls.jp/). These web servers are useful for designing
gRNAs for a few input sequences, but processing large number of in—
put sequences requires a laborious process. Even in such cases,
CRISPRdirect returns the results quickly and provides a convenient

interface for automated gRNA design as described in the Data ex—
port and API section, making it a powerful tool for using CRISPR/
Cas system on a genome—wide scale.

2 Web server implementation

2.1 Overview

The web server accepts an accession number, a genome coordinate
or an arbitrary nucleotide sequence up to 10 kbp as input (Fig. 1A)
and returns a list of CRISPR/Cas target candidates. Target sequences
of 20 nt adjacent to the PAM sequence (e.g. NGG, NRG) are
searched from both strands of the input sequence and listed as
shown in Figure 1B. The list contains target position, target se—
quence, additional information on the sequence and the number of
target sites in the genome. The additional information on the se—
quences such as GC content and calculated melting temperature
(Tm) are provided, since previous report suggested that ngNA se—
quences with very high or low GC content were less effective against
their targets (Wang et 41]., 2014). The presence or absence of TTTT

(four consecutive T’s that cause pol III termination) in the target se—
quence is also indicated in order to avoid TTTT in gRNA vectors
with pol III promoter. A detailed description of the web server is
provided in Supplementary Methods.

2.2 Off—target evaluation

The number of target sites in the genome (Fig. 1B) is counted
using Jellyfish (Margais and Kingsford, 2011). The column ‘20
mer+PAM’ shows the number of hits with perfect matches for
each target sequence (20 mer) adjacent to the PAM. Although the
exact length of the completely complementary region necessary
for cleavage by CRISPR nucleases is unknown, the mutations
within the ‘seed’ sequence at 8—12nt immediately adjacent to the
PAM are known to impair cleavage, suggesting that this region is
the most critical determinant of target specificity (Cong et al.,
2013; Fu et al., 2013; Hsu et al., 2013; Pattanayak et al., 2013).
Therefore, we built up the columns ‘12 mer+PAM’ and ‘8
mer+PAM’ in order to show the number of hits with perfect
matches for their seed sequence (12 or 8 mer, respectively) adja—
cent to the PAM. Note that the numbers of hits displayed here in—
clude both on—target and off—target sites. For instance, one (‘1’) in
these columns indicates that the sequence has only one perfect
match with the intended target site. Any number greater than one
indicates that there are some potential off—target sites. Thus, in
terms of avoiding off—target editing, the smaller the number (but
not zero) is, the better. Zero (‘0’) in these columns means that the
sequence has no match in the genomic sequence; such sequences
may possibly span over exon—exon junctions, so their use should
be avoided. CRISPRdirect highlights the CRISPR/Cas targets that
have relatively fewer off—target sites (Fig. 1B and C). A detailed
list of off—target candidates can be investigated by clicking the
‘detail’ link (Fig. 1E). The searches allowing mismatches and gaps
(insertions and/or deletions) are performed using GGGenome
(http://GGGenome.dbcls.jp/) REST API developed by the authors’
group instead of widely used BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990), be—
cause BLAST may overlook some potential off—targets as men—
tioned in our previous work describing siDirect (Naito et al.,
2004), a web server for designing functional siRNA with reduced
off—target effects. GGGenome quickly searches short nucleotide
sequences utilizing suffix arrays and inverse suffix links indexed
on solid state drive (SSD). As shown in Supplementary Table S1,
off—target searches allowing gaps are not yet available in other
existing web tools. However, the most recent report shows that
CRISPR/Cas9 system has off—target activity with insertions or de—
letions between target DNA and gRNA sequences (Lin et al.,
2014). Therefore, we consider that off—target searches allowing
mismatches and gaps would be a more suitable procedure to list
off—target candidates exhaustively. The positions of the mis—
matches and gaps are visualized in the list (Fig. 1E), which may
help predict the potency of off—target editing.

CRISPRdirect incorporates genomic sequences of various organ—
isms to perform off—target searches. Although Xenopus laevis has
long been used as a preferred model organism among developmental
biologists, we incorporated X.tropicalis genome instead of X.laevis
genome, because X.tropicalis is diploid while X.laevis is allotetra—
ploid which makes it difficult to select specific targets.

There are some loci that are difficult to select specific targets.
Typical examples are the histone clusters (NM_021059, etc.) and
ribosomal proteins (NM_022551, etc.), which are known to form
multigene families. When designing CRISPR targets for such genes,
users should manually investigate a detailed list of potential

off—target sites (Fig. 1E) and select the sequence that has fewer
off—target hits on unrelated loci. Alternatively, if site—specific gRNA
could not be designed within intended region, multiple gRNA
approaches would be considerable (Guilinger et al., 2014; Ran
et al., 2013; Tsai et al., 2014). For such strategy, graphical view of
CRISPRdirect results which visualizes the position and orientation
of target sites (Fig. 1C) would be helpful for selecting paired
gRNAs.

2.3 Data export and API

The results can be exported as tab—delimited text or in JSON format
from the bottom of the result page (Fig. 1D). Users can copy—paste
the text results into a spreadsheet or text editor for downstream
analysis. The results can also be downloaded as a separate file by
clicking the ‘download’ link. Alternatively, tab—delimited text or
JSON output can be obtained via API, which is convenient for
users to design a number of CRISPR/Cas targets in an automated
manner.

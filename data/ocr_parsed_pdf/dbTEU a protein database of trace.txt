ABSTRACT

Summary: Biological trace elements are required for numerous
biological processes and by all organisms. We describe a database,
deEU (DataBase of Trace Element Utilization), that features
known transporters and user proteins for five trace elements
(copper, molybdenum, nickel, cobalt and selenium) and represents
sequenced organisms from the three domains of life. The manually
curated deEU currently includes ~16500 proteins from >700
organisms, and offers interactive trace element, protein, organism
and sequence search and browse tools.

Availability and Implementation: deEU is freely available at

1 BACKGROUND

Biological trace elements are used in small amounts but are utilized
by all organisms. These micronutrients, such as iron (Fe), zinc
(Zn), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), manganese (Mn), nickel
(Ni), cobalt (Co), selenium (Se) and iodine (I), play important
roles in a variety of biological processes by providing proteins with
unique catalytic, coordination, redox functions and also have other
functions. Metals are used either as coordinated ions or as part of
more complex metal-containing cofactors (such as molybdopterin
for Mo and vitamin B12 for Co) (Mendel et al., 2007). Se is mainly
used in the form of selenocysteine (Sec), known as the 21st amino
acid in proteins inserted co-translationally into nascent polypeptide
chains (Bock et al., 1991). Investigation of proteins that utilize
trace elements (metalloproteins and selenoproteins) as well as other
proteins involved in trace element homeostasis (such as transporters,
regulators and chaperones) and cofactor biosynthesis pathways may
provide important information for understanding utilization of trace
elements and their common and unique features.

Several databases have previously been developed that provide
sequence and other information for selected trace elements, such
as Metalloprotein Database & Browser (MDB) (Castagnetto et al.,
2002) and SelenoDB (Castellano et al., 2008). In addition, efforts
on evolutionary processes of metal utilization produced sets of
metalloproteins in several organisms (Andreini et al., 2006; Dupont
et al., 2006). These resources contain useful, but partial information

about trace element utilization and are restricted to a limited number
of organisms.

Here, we describe (1me (database of trace element utilization)
which includes all known transporters and user proteins (excluding
metal-binding chaperones and regulators) for ﬁve trace elements:
Cu, Mo, Ni, Co and Se, in >700 sequenced organisms across the
three domains of life. Approximately 16500 proteins are stored in
the database that represent known proteins and processes dependent
on these ﬁve trace elements. In addition, the deEU offers multiple
search and browse options, such as BLAST homology searches,
and allows compilation of sets of trace element utilization proteins
in individual organisms.

2 DATABASE CONTENT

We previously carried out comparative genomic analyses of
utilization of Cu, Mo, Ni, Co and Se (Kryukov and Gladyshev,
2004; Lobanov et al., 2009; Ridge et al., 2008; Zhang and
Gladyshev, 2008a; Zhang and Gladyshev, 2008b; Zhang et al.,
2009). Members of known metal transporters and metalloproteins
were analyzed by several approaches, including conserved domain,
genomic context, phylogenetic and metal-binding ligand analyses
(Zhang and Gladyshev, 2009). The identiﬁcation of selenoproteins is
also reliable because several independent algorithms with excellent
performance have been developed to identify these proteins in
sequence databases (Kryukov et al., 1999, 2003; Kryukov and
Gladyshev, 2004; Zhang and Gladyshev, 2005).

In deEU v. 1.0, we compiled the largest protein database speciﬁc
for the utilization of ﬁve trace elements, which features all sequenced
genomes from the three domains of life (as of December 2008;
NCBI). Based on trace element and protein category, proteins were
divided into eight groups: (i) Cu transporter, (ii) Cu user, (iii) Mo
transporter, (iv) Mo user, (v) Ni/Co transporter, (vi) Ni user, (vii) Co
user (Co/B 12-dependent proteins) and (viii) Se user (selenoproteins).
For each entry in deEU, we provide the following information: (i)
organism name, (ii) kingdom, (iii) dependence on a particular trace
element, (iv) protein category, (v) protein family description, (vi)
GenBank accession number, (vii) protein sequence, (viii) structure
information (BLAST search against PDB sequence database) and
(ix) ﬁmctional association (search against STRING, a database of
known and predicted ﬁmctional associations).

As a novel resource for the analyses of trace elements in sequenced
organisms, (1me provides large protein datasets for understanding
trace element utilization and evolution in the three domains of life.
Compared with published databases, deEU greatly extends the
information about utilization of trace elements and should be a
valuable resource for researchers working in this ﬁeld. Our database

is also the ﬁrst attempt to deﬁne metalloproteomes, i.e. sets of
proteins that represent all or almost all metal-dependent proteins
in sequenced organisms.

3 DATABASE INTERFACE AND TOOLS

The database system is implemented in openSUSE 11.1 (Linux). It
employs Apache as web server and Perl for interactive web pages.
The deEU supports various search options in order to facilitate
access to and utilization of the information stored in the database.
The ‘Browse organism’ page shows the list of all examined
prokaryotes and the majority of examined eukaryotes (Fig. 1A).
Organisms are classiﬁed into phyla or clades. Since some eukaryotic
genomes are incompletely sequenced, we selected a subset of
the examined eukaryotes (including all major model organisms)
for some eukaryotic phyla. By clicking on the organism name,
a user can retrieve all trace element-related proteins in the
selected organism. The results are shown as a tab-delimited
text format. Each protein entry contains several items, including
‘Trace element’, ‘Protein category’, ‘Protein family’, ‘NCBI
accession number’, ‘Sequence’, ‘Structural information (PDB)’
and ‘Functional association (STRING)’. Proteins are sorted by
‘Trace element’, ‘Protein category’ and ‘Protein family’. The NCBI
accession number is linked to GenBank. Although GenBank entries
contain protein sequence information, errors were found for some
proteins, including the majority of selenoproteins (i.e. the Sec.
codon in selenoprotein genes is often annotated as stop signal).
Thus, in deEU, we provide sequence information for each protein
upon clicking on ‘show sequence’ button (for selenoproteins, Sec.
residues are represented by U and highlighted in red). In addition,
we provide links for BLAST searches against PDB sequence
database and ﬁmctional association networks predicted by STRING
(http://string.embl.de/). Figure 1B shows one example: clicking on
the actinobacterium Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus shows all trace
element utilization proteins in this organism. Figure lC—E show

further information: the accession number link, ‘show sequence’
feature and STRING ﬁmctional prediction, respectively.

The ‘View protein family’ page provides user with an interactive
map of all protein families in deEU. User may retrieve members
of a protein family by simply clicking on its name.

With the ‘Search’ page, user can search for predeﬁned protein
information via three options: protein category, protein family and
keyword search. In addition, if a protein family contains a large
number of subfamilies, user may use speciﬁc subfamily name
(e.g. laccase or ceruloplasmin instead of multicopper oxidase). The
output format of all three options is the same. It is also similar
to that of the browse tool (see above) except that two additional
columns, ‘Organism’ and ‘Kingdom’, are included for database
search results.

We also provide online BLAST service based on NCBI
wwaLAST v. 2.2.18 to support sequence similarity searches
against the entire deEU sequence database. To use BLAST, the
user needs to input a query protein sequence and select a BLAST
program (currently blastp or blastx). The user can modify other
default settings, such as E-value cutoff, low complexity ﬁlter and
the number of alignments shown in the BLAST output.

deEU offers users a real-time monitor program that shows the
distribution of protein categories in the current database. When new
proteins are added into deEU, the ‘Statistics’ page automatically
updates the number of each category. In addition, by clicking
on the number that follows each category, users can retrieve the
corresponding protein information with the same format as the
database search output.

All proteins or subsets of protein sequences (e.g. Cu transporters
or selenoproteins) can be downloaded in FASTA format with
the annotation of protein family, GenBank accession number (if
available), trace element, protein category, source organism and
phylum. These ﬁles are stored in text format and are available on
the ‘Download’ page.

4 PERSPECTIVES

We focused on developing the tools for the analysis of utilization of
ﬁve trace elements, Cu, Mo, Ni, Co and Se, in sequenced organisms
across the three domains of life. We plan to update our database
periodically to include newly identiﬁed proteins involved in trace
element utilization, especially new transporters and user proteins.
We also plan to include information on additional proteins (such as
proteins involved in molybdopterin and Sec biosynthesis and metal
chaperones) and additional trace elements.

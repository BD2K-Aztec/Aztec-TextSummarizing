Abstract

Motivation: There are now many predictors capable of identifying the likely phenotypic effects of
single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or short in—frame Insertions or Deletions (lNDELs) on the increas—
ing amount of genome sequence data. Most of these predictors focus on SNVs and use a combin—
ation of features related to sequence conservation, biophysical, and/or structural properties to link
the observed variant to either neutral or disease phenotype. Despite notable successes, the map—
ping between genetic variants and their phenotypic effects is riddled with levels of complexity that
are not yet fully understood and that are often not taken into account in the predictions, despite
their promise of significantly improving the prediction of deleterious mutants.

Results: We present DEOGEN, a novel variant effect predictor that can handle both missense SNVs
and in—frame lNDELs. By integrating information from different biological scales and mimicking the
complex mixture of effects that lead from the variant to the phenotype, we obtain significant im—
provements in the variant—effect prediction results. Next to the typical variant—oriented features
based on the evolutionary conservation of the mutated positions, we added a collection of protein—
oriented features that are based on functional aspects of the gene affected. We cross—validated
DEOGEN on 36825 polymorphisms, 20821 deleterious SNVs, and 1038 lNDELs from SwissProt.
The multilevel contextualization of each (variant, protein) pair in DEOGEN provides a 10% improve—
ment of MCC with respect to current state—of—the—art tools.

1 Introduction

The human exome covers ~1% of the entire genome and contains
roughly 180 000 protein—coding exons (Ng et al., 2009). There are
currently 40 million human variants identified by genome sequenc—
ing over multiple individuals from different genetic backgrounds
(Sherry et al., 2001 ), with every individual carrying around four mil—
lion variants in their whole genome. Whole exome sequencing
(WES) identifies approximately 20 000 of these per individual
(Abecasis et al., 2012; Ng et al., 2009) in a cost—effective manner
(Bamshad et al., 2011; Cooper et al., 1995), and has led to the suc—
cessful identification of many new disease—gene associations in the
last years (Bamshad et al., 2011; Boycott et al., 2013).

The huge amount of WES data that became available over the
last decade has allowed researchers to explore the genetic basis of
human disease, and tools were developed that aid in the identifica—
tion of disease—causing genetic variants. For example, variant priori—
tization tools (Moreau and Tranchevent, 2012) process exome
sequencing data and rank the observed variants, so that the ones
most likely to be causative for a specific disease are ranked highest.
The major benefit of this ranking is that it focuses subsequent
in vitro validation experiments to the subset of genetic candidates
that are more likely to be related to the disease under investigation
(Moreau and Tranchevent, 2012). The state of the art variant priori—
tization methods integrate heterogeneous sources of genetic and bio—
logical information (Sifrim et al., 2013; Robinson et al., 2014),
where one of the most critical features are the scores of pathogen—
icity for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) as predicted by tools such
as PolyPhen2 (Adzhubei et al., 2010), Sift (Ng and Henikoff, 2001),
MutationTaster (Schwarz et al., 2010), Mutation Assessor (Reva
et al., 2011), PhyloP (Cooper et al., 2005), GERP ++(Davydov
et al., 2010), and CADD (Kircher et al., 2014). These tools use ma—
chine learning (ML) approaches to address the variant—effect predic—
tion problem from many different angles related to the known
proxies for pathogenicity, such as the evolutionary conservation of
the mutated position (Adzhubei et al., 2010; Ng and Henikoff,
2001; Zeng et al., 2014), the stability change upon mutation
(Dehouck et al., 2009; De Baets et al., 2011), possible structural al—
terations (Adzhubei et al., 2010; De Baets et al., 2011), the change
in physico/chemical characteristics due to the mutation (Stone and
Sidow, 2005) and functional annotations using GO terms
(Calabrese et al., 2009).

The phenotypical interpretation of protein—level alterations on
the level of individuals is the ultimate goal of this field (Tavtigian
et al., 2008; van den Berg et al., 2015), but this causal relationship is
still far from being completely understood and it is confounded by
many aspects related to the intrinsic complexity of cell life (Reumers
et al., 2009; Sahni et al., 2015). A crucial restriction of variant—effect
prediction is that an alteration of the protein’s molecular phenotype,
even if it is a sine qua non condition for the disease phenotype in the
carrier individual, may not constitute in itself a sufficient cause for
the disease: this also depends on the particular role that the affected
protein plays in the well—being of the organism (Reumers et al.,
2009; Sahni et al., 2015; Yates and Sternberg, 2013). Even the most
commonly used features, which relate evolutionary constraints with
likely functional damage, offer only a partial correlation with the
pathogenicity of the variant (Tavtigian et al., 2008). Consequently,
additional information that bridges the variant—phenotype gap is
crucial to improve variant—effect predictions.

Here, we present DEOGEN, a novel method for variant—effect
prediction that integrates heterogeneous sources of information in
order to analyze each (protein, variant) pair by combining different

levels of contextualisation of the protein function with a Random
Forest (RF) (Breiman, 2001) predictor. After a cross—validation with
very strict settings, DEOGEN performs 10% better than the most
recently developed variant—effect predictors that target missense
SNVs. Additionally, we show that our approach is general enough
to provide an improvement in the prediction of the phenotypic ef—
fects of short in—frame genetic variants (INDELs), where, after re—
training the RF using almost the same features as for SNVs,
DEOGEN performs 17% better than variant—effect predictors with—
out multilevel contextualization. These improvements show that
adding levels of contextualization to variant effect prediction helps
to approach the complexity of cell life, an effect observed for both
SNVs and INDELs. The increased contextualization will also, in
time, allow a better understanding of why particular variants might
have a particular deleterious effect.

2 Methods

2.1 Datasets

The main dataset used for benchmarking and training our predictor
is the September 2011 version of Humsavar (Humsavar11), which
contains 20 821 deleterious SNVs and 36 825 polymorphisms over
11 969 proteins. In order to provide further comparison with other
state of the art methods, we ran also a separate cross—validation on
Humsavar13, the January 2013 version of Humsavar, which con—
tains 22 617 disease SNVs and 37 331 polymorphisms. For the
benchmarking and training of the INDEL predictions, we used the
dataset from PROVEAN (Choi et al., 2012), which has been made
publicly available by the authors and allows a direct comparison of
the results. This dataset, which we call INDVAR, contains 1038 in—
frame variants involving 1—6 aminoacids: 729 deletions, 171 inser—
tions and 138 replacements (in—frame substitution of multiple amino
acids), mapped on 520 proteins. 841 of them (84%) are annotated
as deleterious and 197 (16%) are polymorphisms.

2.2 Variant—oriented features

We used three evolutionary derived scores calculated from multiple
sequence alignments (MSAs) to assess how likely the protein is to
tolerate the mutation. Conceptually these scores can be divided into
column-wise and sequence-wise categories. In the former category,
the value is derived by considering only the position of the sequence
(and thus a column in the MSA) in which the mutation occurs, while
in the latter the entire sequence is taken into account while calculat—
ing the score.

2.2.1 Column-Wise features

For each protein for which we want to predict the outcome of the muta—
tions (the query protein) we obtained the MSAs using JackHMMER
(Eddy 2011) with one iteration and E value of 0.1 against NCBInr data—
base. The collected homologs were further filtered as a function of a
Sequence Identity greater than 85% and a coverage higher than 80% in
order to keep only the sequences that are functionally similar to the
query sequence. From this MSA, we calculated the Conservation Index
(CI), as proposed in (Calabrese et al., 2009). In the following equation,
A is the set of the possible 20 aminoacids and i is the position of the
MSA in which the mutation occurs. fa(i) is thus the frequency of occur—
rence of aminoacid a at position i while fa is the frequency of a as
observed in the entire alignment:

The other column—wise score is LOR, the log—odd ratio of
observing the wildtype amino acid it! with respect to the mutated
amino acid m at the target position:  is the frequency of occur—
rence of wildtype (w) aminoacid at position i, while  is the fre—
quency of the mutated (m) aminoacid in the same column of the

MSA.
LOR : log — log  (2)

2.2.2 Sequence-Wise features

The PROV score is taken from the PROVEAN predictor (Choi
et al., 2012) and evaluates the deleteriousness of a mutation by com—
paring the wild—type and mutated sequence with closely related func-
tional homologous sequences in the MSA. Mutations that reduce the
similarity between the query protein and the functional homologs
collected with PBLAST are considered more likely to be deleterious.
This change in similarity is calculated by averaging many ‘delta
alignment scores’ (Choi et al., 2012) over close homologs. Each
delta score is computed as A(Q, v, S) : A(Q’, S) — A(Q, S), where A
is a semiglobal pairwise alignment method, Q and Q’ are the query
protein before and after the implementation of the variant v on it
and S is one of the close functional homolog (Choi et al., 2012).
Because this score is computed on the entire length of the sequence it
is natively able to deal with variants that range over multiple pos—
itions of the protein such as insertions, deletions and replacements
(lNDELs).

2.3 Protein—oriented features

2.3.1 Node degree in PPI networks

We retrieved the protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks pro—
vided in ConsensusPathDB (Kamburov et al., 2011), since it inte—
grates in a complementary and non—redundant way Homo sapiens
binary and complex protein—protein interactions from many existing
public PPI databases. We collected 115 673 interactions between
11370 proteins. The DGR feature reﬂects the degree of a node,
which is defined by the number edges incident on it. It is the simplest
measure of centrality for a given node, and can discriminate between
nodes that are loosely connected to the rest of the networks and
hubs with thousand of edges.

2.3.2 Pathway annotations

We retrieved 3660 biological pathways annotated in
ConsensusPathDB (Kamburov et al., 2011), and adopted the log—
odd score approach used in (Calabrese et al., 2009) to encode the
pathway information into an ML—understandable feature. Here, we
brieﬂy recap the log—odd score calculation procedure for sake of
clarity.

The pathways’ log—odd scores uses the cross—validation training
sets to learn which pathways are more sensitive or more tolerant to
deleterious mutations. For each pathway 73, we initialize to 1 two
counters CE and C5, respectively indicating the number of neutral
(n) and deleterious (d) variants annotated on 73. The training phase
follows the following procedure: for each protein 17 in the training
set, we collect from the database the set 8” of the pathways in which
17 is involved, translating from protein to gene names. Then, for each
pathway x E 8” and for each variant v mapped on p, we add 1 to C;
if v is neutral or 1 to C; if v is deleterious. In this way we assign to
each pathway x the number of deleterious (C25) and neutral (CZ)
variants annotated on it in the training set. We then compute the
probability of having an harmful or neutral variant on the pathway

x by calculating Px(del) : ﬁ/(C: + C25) and Px(neut) :
CZ/(C: + Cg). In order to provide an final measure of the tendency
of pathway x to be harmful we compute the log—odd score
log(Px(del)/Px(neut)).

Once the log—odd scores have been inferred from the training set,
in order to predict a variant m for a protein 17 in the test set, we col—
lect the set of pathways 8” in which 17 is involved and we sum all the
log—odd scores learned from the training set as described in the previ—
ous paragraph. The final one—dimensional PATH feature is com—
puted as:

PATH : Z log(Px(del)/Px(neut)) (3)

x 657;

2.3.3 Recessiveness index

The recessiveness score (REC) is obtained from a linear predictor,
developed in (MacArthur et al., 2012) that discriminates between
loss of function (LoF) tolerant genes and genes that can cause reces—
sive disorders when homozygously lost. From deFSPv2.8 (Liu
et al., 2011, 2013), we collected REC predictions for 14070
proteins.

2.3.4 Essential genes in mouse

From deFSPv2.8 (Liu et al., 2011, 2013) we collected also annota—
tions for the degree of essentiality of 6283 proteins, as derived from
knock—out experiments in mice on human orthologs genes (Georgi
et al., 2013). We included this knowledge in the ESS score because it
can help characterizing the importance of the proteins on which the
mutations occur, and so whether mutations will likely have a strong
effect on the organism.

2.4 Machine learning

In summary, we used three variant—oriented evolutionary—based fea—
tures (CI, LOR and PROV) to contextualize the mutation at the mo—
lecular level: CI and LOR are column-wise while PROV takes the
entire sequence into account, making it a sequence-wise score. To
complete the contextualization, we used also four protein—oriented
features that encompass information about the biological relevance
of the protein/gene in which the variants occur: the number of pro—
tein—protein interactors (DGR), the sensitivity to deleterious muta—
tions of the biological pathway involved (PATH), the REC and the
notion of to what extent the gene should be considered essential
(ESS).

To obtain the final predictions from these features, we used the
RF (Breiman, 2001) classifier implemented in the scikit—learn
Python library (Pedregosa et al., 2011). Different 200—trees models
were developed for SNVs and INDELs: for SNVs we limited the
minimum number of samples required to split an internal node to
100 and the minimum number of samples in newly created leaves to
20 further reducing the possibility of overfitting. For INDELs, we
lowered these parameters due to the smaller size of the dataset and
allowed node splitting and leaves creation with at least 10 samples.

The column—wise variant—oriented scores had to be treated differ—
ently for INDELs. The CI score was adapted for each INDEL I
involving n positions by average the column—wise scores over n:
CIINDEL : n‘lzisl CI(i). Adapting the LOR score to variants span—
ning multiple positions is not always feasible due to the possible
lack of correspondence between wild type and mutant amino acids,
and we thus suppress this feature when dealing with INDELs.

We obtained the prediction performances shown in the Results
Section through a 10—fold cross validation procedure. We designed

the folds by clustering the sequences in Humsavar11 and in
INDVAR as a function of their homology using BlastClust. Proteins
in different folds share less than 30% sequence similarity at 90% of
coverage, in order to avoid any overestimation of the results due to
overfitting. We evaluated the performances with the commonly
adopted scores sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), precision (PRE),
balanced accuracy (BAC), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient
(MCC). In particular, BAC and MCC are not affected by unbalance
in the dataset between the positive (Deleterious) and negative
(Polymorphism) classes.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Contextualization of SNVs

We address the inherently complex variant—effect prediction prob—
lem through the integration of different sources of information. By
describing each (protein, variant) pair from different perspectives
corresponding to different levels of contextualisation, we assembled
the most relevant and accessible pieces of information that are cur—
rently available, with the aim to elucidate the fuzzy and complex
mapping between molecular—level alterations and the individual—
level phenotypic outcome.

We visualize this mapping as a collection of concentric circles
(see Fig. 1), where closest to the variant are the variant-oriented fea—
tures that provide evolutionary—based descriptors of the molecular
alteration introduced by the mutation in the protein. From the se—
cond layer on, the protein-oriented features provide higher level
functional and biological contextualization of the gene/protein

Individuals phenotype

    

Fig. 1. Levels of contextualization within DEOGEN. Illustration of the
heterogeneous sources of information combined within DEOGEN in order to
contextualize each pair (protein, variant) from different levels of contextual-
ization. PROV, Cl, and LOR are variant-oriented features. In particular, CI and
LOR are column-wise evolutionary conservation scores used to investigate
the evolutionary constraints acting on the mutating position in the MSA while
PROV is calculated using the entire sequence. ESS, DGR and REC are protein-
oriented features, aiming at characterizing the functional role of the affected
protein. The most abstract level of contextualization used is the pathway sen-
sitivity to deleterious mutations, inferred using the log-odd score technique
(PATH)

wherein the mutation occurs, so capturing parts of the complex role
played by the affected protein in the cell and in the organism. The
highest level of contextualization used here is the biological pathway
level.

We use three variant-oriented features with different characteris—
tics (see Methods and Fig. 1): the log—odd ratio (LOR) score and
conservation index (CI) (Calabrese et al., 2009), which are column-
ivise measures of the conservation of a mutated column within a
multiple—sequence alignment (MSA), and the PROVEAN (Choi
et al., 2012) predictions (PROV), which provide a sequence-wide
measure of the change in evolutionary distance between the mutated
target protein and close functional homologs that correlates with the
deleteriousness of variants (Choi et al., 2012).

The protein-oriented features use pathway and protein—protein
interaction (PPI) networks information (DGR) as well as genetic and
clinical information, for instance an evaluation of how tolerant the
carrier individual is to homozygous loss—of—function (LoF) mutations
on the affected gene (REC). These protein—oriented features play an
essential role in DEOGEN, and we explain and analyze them in
more detail in the following sections, using Humsavar11 as refer—
ence dataset (see Methods).

3.2 Node degree in PPI networks

Protein function, from enzymatic reactions to participation in com—
plex signaling cascades, requires interaction with other molecules,
from proteins to nucleic acids and chemicals (Das et al., 2014; Yates
and Sternberg, 2013). An important piece of information at this level
is the number of known interaction partners of the investigated pro—
tein; more interactions may indicate hub proteins that play a role in
many processes. We retrieved the number of known interactors for
Human proteins from ConsensusPathDB (Kamburov et al., 2011) for
use as a feature called degree (DGR). Supplementary Fig. 1 shows the
DGR distributions separated into deleterious and polymorphism
classes: although the distributions are partially superimposed, they are
significantly different: both a two—sided Student’s t—test over the ex—
pected values of independent samples and a two—sided Wilcoxon
‘100. These results reveal
that deleterious SNVs tend to occur in proteins with an higher number

rank—sum test give a P value smaller than 10

of binding partners than neutral SNVs. A possible problem underlying
this data is that hub proteins tend to be more studied that peripheral
ones, resulting in more known variants for these proteins. There is,
however, no correlation between number of known variants for each
gene versus its number of interactors (DGR) (r : 0.089), and there—
fore no bias (see Supplementary Fig. 5).

3.3 Recessiveness score

The REC (MacArthur et al., 2012) predicts the ease with which a
particular gene can cause deleterious phenotypes when homozy—
gously lost by discriminating between LoF tolerant genes and genes
involved in recessive diseases (MacArthur et al., 2012).
Supplementary Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the deleterious and
polymorphism classes of SNVs as a function of the REC. Both the
two—sided t—test and the Wilcoxon rank—sum test indicate signifi—
cantly different distributions with P values smaller than 10‘100.
Polymorphisms are denser at low scores (between 0.1 and 0.2), indi—
cating an enrichment of neutral SNVs on genes predicted to be LoF
tolerant, while deleterious SNVs are quasiuniformly distributed and
range towards scores that suggest involvement in recessive diseases.
There are 12 586 SNVs (22% of the total) which could not be
mapped on REC scores because the carrier protein has not been pre—
dicted in (MacArthur et al., 2012). The SNVs that were mapped to

the REC score amount to 68% of the polymorphisms and 89% of
the disease related SNVs. Finally, there is also here no bias due to
the preferential study of human health—related proteins, with a low
correlation (r : 0.23) between each gene’s REC score and the num—
ber of known SNVs mapped to it (see Supplementary Fig. 6).

3.4 Pathway annotations

We retrieved 3660 pathways involving 15 350 genes from
ConsensusPathDB (Kamburov et al., 2011), and mapped 23 231
SNVs of the total 57646 (40%) available in the dataset
Humsavar11 (see Methods) on at least one pathway. The mapped
variants are divided into 11 020 deleterious (47%) and 12 195 neu—
tral SNVs (53%), while of the remaining SNVs without pathway an—
notation 9801 are deleterious (28%) and 24 630 neutral (72%).
This means that 53% of deleterious SNVs can be mapped on at least
one pathway, while the same holds only for 33% of polymorphisms.
Supplementary Fig. 4 shows the 25 pathways that are most likely
(top panel) and least likely (bottom panel) to contain deleterious
variants based on our analysis on Humsavar11. The likelihood of
containing deleterious variants is expressed as a log—odd score (see
Methods), where a zero score means that there is an equal balance
between deleterious and non—deleterious variants, and a positive
(negative) score indicates that the pathway contains mostly disease—
related (neutral) variants.

The pathways most likely to contain deleterious variants are, in
more detail, related to guanine and guanosine salvage (pathway
name: PWY—6620, score: 3.93), Refsum Disease (SMP00451, 3.87),
and Phytanic Acid Peroxisomal Oxidation (SMP00450, 3.87). All
the 51 SNVs mapped on PWY—6620 are deleterious, while
both SMP00451 and SMP00450 pathways have 2 neutral and 143
deleterious SNVs mapped to them. The genes in the top—ranking
pathways tend to reoccur: for instance pathways
HOMOCYSDEGR_PWY until SMP00515 contain the human gene
CBS, which has 94 deleterious and 1 neutral variant mapped to it,
and is instrumental in producing the high log—odd score of those
pathways.

The bottom part of Supplementary Fig. 4 shows the pathways
that are more likely to host neutral variants. These are the termin—
ation of O—glycan biosynthesis (REACT_115835, —5.02), the O—
linked glycosylation of mucins (REACT_115606, —5.07) and the
Olfactory Signaling Pathway (REACT_15488, —6.22). In particular,
all of the 500 SNVs in Humsavar11 mapped on the Olfactory
Signaling Pathway are polymorphisms, which is also the case for
REACT_115835 and REACT_115606 (respectively 150 and 158
polymorphisms).

Supplementary Fig. 3 shows that in the majority of the pathways
15—30% of the genes are covered by at least one SNV. Moreover, it
indicates that there is no correlation between the percentage of genes
in the pathway that are covered by at least one SNV and the deleteri—
ousness of the pathway itself (r : —0.06). Neither is there a bias

towards pathway size (see Supplementary Fig. 8). The log—odd
scores learned from Humsavar11 and INDVAr are available as
Supplementary Material.

3.5 Essential genes in mouse

The combination of gene knock—out experiments in mice on human
ortholog genes with human sequencing data have produced informa—
tion about which genes should be considered essential (Georgi et al.,
2013): an organism is not viable without them because they operate
key functions. Almost a third of the genes in the mouse genome are
essential, and given the common architecture mouse and human
share for many genetic disorders, it has been possible to characterize
a set of 2472 human orthologs of known essential mouse genes
(Georgi et al., 2013). We retrieved these gene annotations at the pro—
tein level from deFSPv2.8 (Liu et al., 2011), characterizing 6283
proteins. We refer to this feature as ESS in the rest of the paper. Also
in this case we investigate the possible bias due to the preferential
study of human health—relevant proteins: the correlation between
the number of known SNVs mapped on a particular gene and its
ESS score is r : 0.01 1 (see Supplementary Fig. 6).

3.6 Incremental contributions of features in SNV
predictions

Based on the variant—oriented and new protein—oriented features,
we evaluated the feature contributions within DEOGEN by cross—
validating it on the Humsavar11 dataset, which contain slightly less
than 60 000 SNVs annotated with the corresponding phenotypic ef—
fect. We chose this dataset because it is widely used and allow direct
comparison of DEOGEN with the published performance of many
different predictors.

DEOGEN integrates the variant—oriented and protein—oriented
information in a RF model, where the heterogeneous data are pro—
cessed and represented in the standardized form of numerical vec—
tors, called feature vectors, on which the RF can perform inference
and predictions. Since ML approaches are highly sensitive to data
bias, we ensured as fair as possible an assessment of the prediction
performances by applying a 10—fold stratified cross—validation,
where the proteins in each fold have been stratified in order to share
less than 30% sequence similarity with the proteins in the other
folds (see Methods).

Table 1 shows the relative contribution of every feature to the
predictive performance using the Humsavar11 dataset, adding each
feature incrementally. Of particular interest are the BAC and
Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) scores, which are less
inﬂuenced by the unbalance between the number of positive and
negative instances in a training set: more polymorphisms than dele—
terious variants are known. We chose PROV as the baseline because
it is in itself an advanced predictor that can natively deal with both

the column-wise evolutionary conservation scores CI and LOR im—
proves the prediction performance (+12% of MCC), showing that
they provide information orthogonal to PROV. These additional
features also improve the specificity and sensitivity of the predictor.

We then added the four protein-oriented features incrementally
to the standard variant-oriented effects (see also Methods for a de—
tailed explanation). The information provided by the PATH feature,
which indicates the sensitivity to disease of the pathways the protein
is part of, gives a 5.6% improvement in terms of MCC. We then
added subsequently the number of interaction partners (DGR) in the
protein—protein interaction network, the recessiveness (REC) index,
which estimates the level of redundancy of the gene, and the ESS
score, which quantifies how essential a gene is as evidenced by
knock—out experiments in mice. Whereas every feature gives an in—
cremental improvement of the BAC and MCC scores, all four pro—
tein—oriented features provide a combined MCC improvement of
slightly more than 16% on top of the variant-oriented features.
These results show that our multi—level contextualisation provides
essential information and significantly increases the quality of the
predictions.

3.7 Comparison with other methods
We compared the cross—validated performances of our predictor
with five state—of—the—art predictors based on the Humsavar11 data—
set (Table 2) and with six predictors on the Humsavar13 dataset
(Table 3). For Humsavar11, the scores were taken from (Choi et al.,
2012), with the following specifications: the PROVEAN scores were
obtained with the published suggested threshold of —2.282 (Choi
et al., 2012), Mutation Assessor scores were computed using the
best performing threshold of 1.9 (Reva et al., 2011), the webserver
version of PolyPhen2 trained on HumDiv was used in order to avoid
the over—estimation of the results due to the overlap between
HumVar and Humsavar11 datasets (Adzhubei et al., 2010), and
SIFT predictions were obtained by running it on August 2011
NCBInr database (Ng and Henikoff, 2001). CADD (Kircher et al.,
2014) scores have been retrieved from deFSPv2.8 (Liu et al.,
2013). The optimal threshold for discriminating between deleterious
and neutral SNVs has been inferred from the ROC curve and is
15.42. Table 2 shows that the different sources of information inte—
grated by our method DEOGEN are effective, since they yield to a
26% improvement of the MCC with respect to PROVEAN, on
which DEOGEN is based. DEOGEN performs roughly 36% better
than SIFT and HumDiv—trained PolyPhen2, and 30% better than
Mutation Assessor. DEOGEN also performs 28.6% better than
CADD raw score in terms of MCC and +7.3% in terms of BAC.
The comparison on Humsavar13 is based on (Zeng et al., 2014),
where the predictions of SIFT were obtained through the webserver,
the scores for GERP ++(Davydov et al., 2010), PhyloP (Cooper

Table 2. Comparison of the predictors on Humsavar 2011

et al., 2005), MutationTaster (Schwarz et al., 2010), and CADD
(Kircher et al., 2014) were extracted from deFSPv2.8 (Liu et al.,
2013), and the EFIN scores were obtained from the published 10
fold cross—validation (Zeng et al., 2014). Table 3 shows that
DEOGEN performs 18% better in terms of MCC and 10% better in
terms of AUC with respect to Mutation Taster. DEOGEN AUC is
also 10.8% better than the AUC obtained by CADD (Kircher et al.,
2014) raw score. DEOGEN MCC and AUC are also respectively
10% and 3.3% higher than the one obtained by EFIN, the most re—
cent variant effect predictor in this benchmark. Although many
other variant prediction methods like SNAP2 [Hecht et al (2015 )]
are available, we here compare only to the most widely adopted
methods and refer to Dong et al. (2015) for an exhaustive compari—
son between methods on a blind test set.

To show the applicability of DEOGEN on real clinical cases, we
describe in Supplementary Material its performance on three well
studied genes with high impact for human health: TP53, F8, and
BRCA1. We show that in the first two cases DEOGEN would be
really useful in clinical studies since it has very high sensitivities (re—
spectively, 98 and 79%), thus correctly selecting nearly all of the
possibly causative SNVs. In the case of BRCA1 predictions are less
satisfying because although the protein-oriented features highlight
the relevance of this gene, the variant-oriented features are mostly
undecided on their outcome, leading to a poor sensitivity (30%) at
71% specificity.

3.8 Contextualisation also improves in—frame lNDELs
prediction

The majority of the variant—effect predictors published to date are
focused on the analysis of SNVs. They are the simplest and most
common form of variants in the genome, are responsible for a large
share of the observed human variability and disease susceptibility
(Abecasis et al., 2012; Cooper and Shendure, 2011; Studer et al.,
2013; Tennessen et al., 2012), and account for roughly 67% of
known pathological mutations (Stenson et al., 2003; Zhao et al.,
2013). On the other hand, WES studies are also identifying a grow—
ing amount of INDEL variants (Mills et al., 2006, 2011), Which is
considered the second largest class of genetic variants in our gen—
ome. In particular, short INDELs ranging from 2 to 20 base pairs
appear to be responsible for 22% of known pathological mutations
(Ball et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2013). INDELs can be either frame—
shifting or in—frame: frame—shifting INDELs cause the insertion/dele—
tion of a number of nucleotides that are not a multiple of 3, thus
causing the alteration of the reading frame and the consequential
complete change of the gene product or early termination of the
transcription. In—frame short INDELs, on the other hand, alter
a multiple of three nucleotides, causing the insertion or deletion of
1—6 amino acids at the protein level (Zhao et al., 2013). INDELs are

generally more disruptive than SNVs, but the effect of purifying se—
lection greatly distinguishes between frameshifting (94% of them
are eliminated) and in—frame INDELs (48% eliminated) (Studer
et al., 2013), leading to a frequency of one in—frame INDEL every 7
SNVs (Ng et al., 2008). Polymorphic INDELs mutations are in fact
also involved in changes of function between the different superfam—
ily domains (Studer et al., 2013; Reeves et al., 2006).

The existing bioinformatics tools developed to predict the patho—
genicity of short in—frame INDELs (Choi et al., 2012; Hu and Ng,
2013; Zhao et al., 2013) focus only on variant-oriented features. In
particular, PROVEAN (Choi et al., 2012) uses an unsupervised se-
quence-wise evolutionary score, while SIFTindel (Hu and Ng, 2013)
and DDIG—in (Zhao et al., 2013) combine different features such as
secondary structure, domain annotation, disorder prediction, and
relative solvent accessibility with ML methods. Here we compared
our performances only with PROVEAN because SIFTindel and
DDIG—in do not provide prediction performances on a publicly
available dataset or comparisons with other methods, although the
authors argue that these three methods have similar performances
(Hu and Ng, 2013). We thereby show that the SNV conclusions
hold for the pathogenicity prediction of INDELs, which also benefits
from the multilevel contextualization.

3.8.1 Incremental contributions of features in

INDELs predictions

To activate DEOGEN for the prediction of the deleteriousness of in—
frame INDELs, we trained a RF model on the INDVAR dataset,
which contains 1038 short in—frame INDELs. Analogously to the
SNVs prediction (Table 1), we show that incrementally adding the
protein context features also leads to better predictions in the
INDELs case (Table 4). The same stratified cross—validation proced—
ure was used as with the SNVs case. The PROV score again serves
as the baseline feature. Adding the CI, our column—wise score of evo—
lutionary conservation now averaged over the positions involved in
the INDEL, provides a 3.5% improvement of the MCC. The path—
way—derived log—odd scores also appear to be relevant also for
INDELs and provide a +9% improvement of the MCC. In order to
identify possible over—fitting caused by the small number of INDELs
available in INDVAR, we differentiated between the pathway log—
odd scores learned on INDVAR alone (PATH') or on INDVAR plus
Humsavar11 (PATH‘TS) (Table 4). The MCC and AUC scores ob—
tained by learning the odds on INDVAR or INDVAR plus
Humsavar11 are very similar, indicating that the information ex—
tracted via the log—odd scores is general enough to be transferred
from SNVs to INDELs. This is possible despite INDELs being gener—
ally more deleterious, and despite slightly different ‘most sensitive’

pathways being derived when analyzing these different datasets (see
Supplementary Figs 9 and 10). The DGR feature causes a slight de—
crease of MCC but a positive effect (+1.9%) on the AUC, while
adding the REC score yields the best prediction performances
reached by DEOGEN. ESS appears to provide unrelevant contribu—
tions and was not included in the final predictor. The last row of
Table 4 shows that the MCC and AUC we obtain for the INDELs
prediction are similar to the ones obtained in the SNVs case, respect—
ively around 0.7 and 0.92. If we compare our best MCC on INDELs
with the one obtained by PROVEAN (Choi et al., 2012) on the
same dataset, it appears that our method gives a 17.4% improve—
ment. The performances of DEOGEN INDELs predictor in function
of the type of INDEL (insertions, deletions and replacements) are
shown in Supplementary Material Table 1.

4 Conclusion

The novel variant—effect predictor we present here integrates hetero—
geneous sources of biological information in order to improve the
contextualization of both the variant and the affected protein. We
do this by merging relevant aspects to the molecular phenotype, the
gene and the biological pathways involved. We also show that this
approach is general enough to be applicable to both SNVs and
INDELs, even if in the latter case the average impact at the molecu—
lar levels is much more disruptive. This functional contextualization
of the protein enables DEOGEN to outperform nine state of the art
predictors, indicating that careful integration of data from relevant
sources is an excellent approach to improve not only predictions,
but also our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the geno—
type—to—phenotype relationship. Future developments will dig deeper
into the interpretation of the single predictions, aiming at under—
standing how a particular variant inﬂuences cell machinery and its
functioning.

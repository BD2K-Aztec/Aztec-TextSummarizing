Abstract

Motivation: Identification of altered pathways that are clinically relevant across human cancers is a
key challenge in cancer genomics. Precise identification and understanding of these altered path—
ways may provide novel insights into patient stratification, therapeutic strategies and the develop—
ment of new drugs. However, a challenge remains in accurately identifying pathways altered by
somatic mutations across human cancers, due to the diverse mutation spectrum. We developed an
innovative approach to integrate somatic mutation data with gene networks and pathways, in order
to identify pathways altered by somatic mutations across cancers.

Results: We applied our approach to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of somatic muta—
tions in 4790 cancer patients with 19 different types of tumors. Our analysis identified cancer—type—
specific altered pathways enriched with known cancer—relevant genes and targets of currently
available drugs. To investigate the clinical significance of these altered pathways, we performed
consensus clustering for patient stratification using member genes in the altered pathways coupled
with gene expression datasets from 4870 patients from TCGA, and multiple independent cohorts
confirmed that the altered pathways could be used to stratify patients into subgroups with signifi—
cantly different clinical outcomes. Of particular significance, certain patient subpopulations with

1 Introduction

In the last few years, studies using high—throughput technologies
have highlighted the fact that the development and progression of
cancer hinges on somatic alterations. These somatic alterations may
disrupt gene functions, such as activating oncogenes or inactivating
tumor suppressor genes, and thus dysregulate critical pathways con—
tributing to tumorigenesis. Therefore, precise identification and
understanding of disrupted pathways may provide insights into
therapeutic strategies and the development of novel agents. Many
large—scale cancer genomics studies, such as The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium
(ICGC), have performed integrated analyses to draft an overview of
somatic alterations in the cancer genome (Kandoth et (11., 2013;
Lawrence et (11., 2013, 2014; Tamborero et (11., 2013). Many of
these studies have reported novel candidate cancer genes mutated at
high and intermediate frequencies in specific cancers as well as
across many cancer types (Lawrence et (11., 2014). However, it is still
a challenge to translate somatic mutations in tumors into the path—
way model for clinical use (Baselga, 2011; Osmanbeyoglu et (11.,
2014). Recently, in order to improve the clinical relevance and util—
ity of somatic mutation analyses, Hopfree et al. (2013) proposed
integrating somatic mutation data with molecular interaction net—
works for patient stratification. They demonstrated that inclusion of
prior knowledge, captured in molecular interaction networks, could
improve identification of patient subgroups with significantly differ—
ent histological, pathological or clinical outcomes and discover
novel cancer—related pathways or subnetvvorks. In a similar manner,
other network—based methods have demonstrated that incorporating
molecular networks and/or biological pathways can improve accur—
acy in identifying cancer—related pathways (Cerami et (11., 2010;
Hwang et (11., 2013; Vandin et (11., 2011; Vaske et (11., 2010).

One limitation of these network—based methods is that they are
not designed to fully utilize large—scale somatic mutation data from
multiple cancer types to determine which particular pathways are
altered by somatic mutations across a range of human cancers. In
addition, due to the incomplete knowledge of existing gene sets and/
or pathway databases, these methods are limited in detecting path—
ways based on a number of altered genes annotated in existing gene
set and pathway databases. Alternatively, the methods that build
pathways de novo without incorporating biological prior knowledge
can be applicable to detecting altered pathways, but these methods
were also not designed to detect cancer—type specific or commonly
altered pathways. To address these, we developed an algorithm
named NTriPath (Network regularized sparse non—negative TRI ma—
trix factorization for PATHway identification) to integrate somatic
mutation, gene—gene interaction networks and gene set or pathway
databases to discover pathways altered by somatic mutations in
4790 cancer patients with 19 different types of cancers.
Incorporating existing gene set or pathway databases enables
NTriPath to report a list of altered pathways across cancers, and
make it easy to determine/compare which particular pathways are
altered in a particular cancer type(s). In particular, the use of the

large—scale genome—wide somatic mutations from 4790 cancer pa—
tients enables NTriPath to explore modular structures of mutational
data within a cancer type and/or across multiple cancer types (using
matrix factorization) to identify cancer—type—specific or commonly
altered pathways. In addition, the use of gene—gene interaction net—
works with somatic mutation and pathway databases enables
NTriPath to classify genes, which were not annotated in existing
pathway databases, as new member genes of the identified altered
pathways based on connectivity in the gene—gene interaction
networks.
The questions that we investigate here are:

1. whether large—scale integrative somatic mutation analysis that
integrates somatic mutations across many cancer types with the
gene—gene interaction networks and pathway database can reli—
ably identify cancer—type—speciﬁc or common pathways altered
by somatic mutations across cancers;

2. whether the identiﬁed pathways can be used as a prognostic bio—
marker for patient stratiﬁcation—with the assumption that the
altered pathways contribute to cancer development and progres—
sion and, thus, impact survival.

In these experiments, we demonstrated that the cancer—type—spe—
cific and commonly altered pathways identified by NTriPath are
biologically relevant to the corresponding cancer type and are asso—
ciated with patient survival outcomes. We also showed that cancer—
specific altered pathways are enriched with many known cancer—
relevant genes and targets of available drugs, including those already
FDA—approved. These results imply that the cancer—specific altered
pathways can guide therapeutic strategy to target the altered path—
ways that are pivotal in each cancer type.

2 Methods

In this section, we first describe the notations for the data. We then
review non—negative matrix tri—factorization (NMTF) and introduce
the framework of network regularized sparse non—negative tri—ma—
trix factorization for pathway identification.

2.1 Notations

We construct a binary data matrix X 6 RM“ from the mutation
data, where n is the number of patients, m is the number of genes
and the (i,/')th element of the matrix X, [XL-i, is 1 if the ith patient
has a mutation on the jth gene, 0 otherwise. We construct a binary
matrix U 6 RM,“ denoting a patient cluster, where [21 indicates the
number of cancer types and [UL-,- : 1 indicates the ith patient has jth
cancer type. We derive the adjacency matrix from the human gene—
gene interaction networks and denote it as A, where ,7- : 1 if the
ith gene is interacting with the jth genes in the networks and 0 other—
wise. We define the graph Laplacian matrix by L : D —A, where
each diagonal element in the diagonal matrix D is given by
[D],,- : 27,17. We construct a binary matrix V0 6 NW,“ from the
specific pathway database denoting pathway information, where [22

is the number of pathways and [VOL-I- : 1 if the ith gene is annotated
in the jth pathway as a member in the pathway database, otherwise
0. Since the current pathway database annotation is still incomplete,
we define a matrix V 6 RM,“ denoting newly updated pathway in—
formation, including newly added member genes by NTriPath. We
define a matrix S E 11%}:le2 denoting cancer type and pathway associ—
ations, where each element of [SLI-
tvveen the ith cancer type with the jth pathway. Higher values of

represents the associations be—

elements indicate stronger associations between cancer types and
pathways. The objective is to derive newly updated pathway infor—
mation V and cancer—type and pathway associations S based on X
and U (Fig. 1).

2.2 Non—negative matrix tri—factorization

NMTF aims to approximate a data matrix X by the product of three
matrices, such that X z USV T , where U 6 RT“, S E 1R5] “9 and
V 6 RT”? Since the aim of our study is to discover altered path—
ways by somatic mutations across cancers, we can define the object—
ive function to estimate the factor matrix S, as

- 1 T 2
IgnglX—USVO  (1)

where   is the Frobenius norm of matrix S, and X, U, S, and V0
denote somatic mutation data from patients, patient’s cancer type,
cancer—type and pathway associations, and cancer—related pathways,
respectively.

A limitation of this approach in Equation (1) is the sparsity of
somatic mutation matrix X (>98% of entries are 0) used to predict
cancer—type and pathway associations. Thus, the Frobenius norm in
Equation (1) might not be appropriate to evaluate the goodness of
the decomposition models since it is dominated by the errors on 0
entries when the data matrix X is sparse. In addition, due to the in—
completeness of current pathway database annotation, the predicted
cancer—type and pathway associations S might be biased toward
pathways containing mutated genes like those currently annotated
in existing pathway databases. A recent study suggests that incorpo—
rating biological prior knowledge, such as gene—gene interaction
networks, as a regularization term to NMTF could help to more ac—
curately identify new member genes in the existing pathways, as
well as an association matrix S (Hwang et (11., 2012).

ucts of three matrices, patient cluster U, pathway information V and cancer-
type and pathway association S. Prior knowledge is introduced from gene—

2.3 Network regularized sparse non—negative

tri—matrix factorization model

To address the above problems, we developed an approach called
NTriPath (Network regularized sparse non—negative TRI matrix fac—
torization for PATHway identification) to handle the sparsity of the
somatic mutation matrix and the incompleteness of current pathway
database annotation by incorporating the prior knowledge from
human gene—gene interaction networks.

We define a weighted loss function to deal with the sparseness of
the somatic mutation data matrix X. The weighted loss function en—
ables us to focus on approximating errors at nonzero entries (i.e.
somatic mutation). We introduce the graph Laplaican L and the ini—
tial pathway information Vo, derived from human gene—gene inter—
action networks and current pathway databases, respectively.

Then we define a new objective function as follows:

. T 2
O _ V ,+ V 2
Sml>rbllW (X US  Q(S, ), ( )

where W 6 NW" is a weight matrix where [Wlil- : 1 if [XL-I- > 0
otherwise 0. The operator 0 represents the element—wise multiplica—
tion. A regularization term 9 for V and S is as follows:

n<s,v>:tsttsttiwvtvtiHarv—Votiwtrrwﬁv), (3)

where {2.}20 denotes user—specific parameters and HS) )1 denotes
the [l—norm of S, which is equal to the sum of the absolute values of
all the entries of S. The third term in the regularization term (3) is
introduced as a supervised way of minimizing the squared loss be—
tween the predicted newly updated pathway information V and the
initial pathway information V0. The fourth term introduces the
graph Laplacian L derived from the gene—gene interaction networks
as prior knowledge to guide the clustering of the genes. This term is
called the smoothness term, which encourages the connected nodes
(genes) in a graph to be assigned to the same cluster (pathway).

To estimate the optimal solutions of our minimization problem, we
adapt the multiplicative update method (Lee and Seung, 2001),

which can be derived from the gradient of the objective function (2)
with respect to each factor matrix. The following are the update
rules for the factor matrices, S and V:

where X: W o (USV T ).

However, one of the issues of the multiplicative update rules is
that when an entry in the factors becomes 0, it is forever stuck at 0.
In theory, the entries should never become 0 provided that all the
entries in the factors are initialized with positive values. However,
due to the finite precision of calculations, 0 entries may well appear
in practice. To avoid this inadmissible zeros problem, we examine
the Karush—Kuhn—Tucker (KKT) conditions for the solution in each
update and then replace the inadmissible zeros entries with a small
positive number K (Chi and Kolda, 2012; Seung—Jun et al., 2012).
Note that the KKT conditions for the factor matrix S in Equation
(2) can be written in an element—wise form:

D N D
5172 0, 06,-,- — 06,-]- 20, Sii(otil- —

«31): 0. (8)

where  and at)? are the numerator and the denominator of the
multiplicative factor in Equation (6), respectively:

at}; : [UT (WoX)V]

(9)

iii
«EZIUTXVlﬁ/IsllSlli- (10>

The KKT conditions state that if S,,-> 0, the multiplicative factor
should be equal to 1; otherwise it should be 31. Thus, we replace
the 0 entry whose corresponding multiplicative factor is >1 with K
to prevent the inadmissible 0 from occurring. The complete
NTriPath algorithm with the choice of parameters used in the ex—
periments is outlined in Algorithm 1. We have also proven the con—
vergence of the algorithm. See Supplementary Information for the
detailed proof of algorithm correctness and convergence.
Empirically, the algorithm converges fast within 50 iterations in the
experiments.

3 Results

We conducted simulation experiments using synthetic datasets to in—
vestigate the performance of NTriPath to discover cancer—type—
specific altered pathways and identify new member genes in the path—
ways. Then we performed experiments with TCGA mutation profiles
to identify cancer—type—specific altered pathways across cancers. In the
experiments using TCGA datasets, we first ran NTriPath to identify
cancer—type—specific altered pathways across cancers. To investigate
the clinical relevance of the identified cancer—type—specific pathways,
we collected gene expression data from TCGA and independent data—
sets and performed consensus clustering using the member genes in
the identified cancer—type specific pathways for patient stratification.

3.1 Simulation

We generated synthetic mutation datasets and performed experi—
ments using NTriPath. Specifically, we generated synthetic mutation
data containing five patient subgroups and 10 pathways. Each sub—
group included between one and seven altered pathways. We

generated the gene—gene interaction networks and member genes in
the pathway were densely connected with each other in the net—
works. We introduced a higher mutation rate to one of the sub—
groups to investigate whether different mutation rates for each
subgroup would affect the performance of NTriPath to discover
cancer—type—specific altered pathways. Experimental results indi—
cated that NTriPath could discover subgroup—specific altered path—
ways and new member genes in the altered pathways
(Supplementary Figs. S1 and S3). Additional experiments using
large—scale experiments (e.g. 12 000 genes) and with different muta—
tion rates also indicated that NTriPath could accurately identify sub—
group—specific altered pathways (Supplementary Table S1). We
summarize the results of the simulation in Supplementary
information.

3.2 TCGA somatic mutation profiles, pathway database
and gene—gene interaction networks preparation

3.2.1 Somatic mutation, gene—gene interaction networks and
pathway database

We collected the somatic mutation data (e.g. Mutation Annotation
Format files) for 4790 patients and 19 different cancer types from
the TCGA data portal on May 19, 2013 (strel’tsov et al., 2001) (see
Supplementary Table S1). Then we generated a binary matrix X of
4790 patients X 25168 genes, with 1 indicating a mutation and 0 no
mutation. We constructed a matrix A representing the gene—gene
interaction networks by combining networks from Zhang et al.
(2011), the Human Protein Reference Database (December 2013)
(Keshava Prasad et al., 2009) and Rossin et al. (2011). The matrixA
contains 63898 binary undirected interactions between 12456
genes. We collected four sets of pathways: (1) 4620 conserved sub—
networks from the human gene—gene interaction network (Suthram
et al., 2010), (2) 186 KEGG, (3)217 Biocarta and (4) 430 Reactome
gene sets from MsigDB (September 2010) (Subramanian et al.,
2005) to generate a matrix Vo representing the initial pathway infor—
mation. After preprocessing (i.e. removing genes not present in both
the somatic mutation and the gene—gene interaction networks), we
generated a dataset for 4970 patients in 19 cancer types with 11089
genes.

3.3 Cancer—type—specific altered pathway identification
We applied NTriPath to somatic mutation data from TCGA for
4790 patients and 19 different cancer types. NTriPath produced two
matrices as output; (1) newly updated pathways altered by mutated
genes V and (2) altered pathways by cancer type matrix S. We used
S matrix to identify cancer—type—specific altered pathways across
cancers. Specifically, we ranked pathways based on values of elem—
ents of the S matrix for each cancer type (e.g. rank pathways based
on all values of the ith row which indicate association scores be—
tween the ith cancer type and all pathways). In addition, to measure
the statistical significance of cancer—type and pathway associations,
we performed a permutation test (e.g. we randomly permuted som—
atic mutation data X and repeated the experiments 5000 times to
calculate empirical P—values) and defined cancer—type—specific
altered pathways based on the following strict criteria: (1) pathways
must be ranked within the top Kth compared with other pathways
in each cancer type based on their association scores in matrix S;
and (2) pathways must have significant BH—adjusted P—values
(Benjamini—Hochberg—adjusted P—values using a false discovery rate
cutoff of 0.1) (see Supplementary Table S2).

3.4 Biological interpretation for the cancer—type—specific
altered pathways

In each cancer type, we selected the top Kth ranked altered path—
ways by statistical significance from NTriPath to generate cancer—
type—specific altered pathways. NTriPath accurately identified can—
cer—type—specific altered pathways that are biologically relevant for
each type of cancer using KEGG, Biocarta and Reactome pathway
datasets (Supplementary Table S3). However, those current pathway
databases cover only a small fraction of human genes (e.g. there are
1267, 5267 and 4159 genes in Biocarta, KEGG and Reactome path—
way databases from MSigDB Sept. 2010). To address this problem,
we used 4620 conserved subnetvvorks which cover 8470 genes as
additional pathway data. Thus, we reported the results of NTriPath
using 4620 conserved subnetvvorks for further analysis. In each can—
cer type, we selected the top three ranked altered pathways by statis—
tical significance from NTriPath with the 4620 subnetvvork modules
to generate cancer—type—specific altered pathways (Supplementary
Table S4).

Interestingly, NTriPath was able to find altered pathways con—
taining not only genes that were frequently mutated but also genes
that were mutated in a small subset of patients in each cancer type
(Supplementary Table 3 and Fig. S1). Gene set enrichment analysis
using the genes from the top three altered pathways showed that the
altered pathways are significantly enriched with well—known cancer—
related genes from the COSMIC database (Forbes et al., 2015) and
known drug target genes as well as cancer—relevant biological proc—
esses (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6).

Focusing on kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) as a proof
of concept, NTriPath identified the pathway consisting of VHL,
USP33, D102, TCEB1 and TCEB2 as the top—ranked altered path—
way in KIRC (Fig. 2a). The VHL (von—Hippel Lindau) gene is a
well—known tumor suppressor associated with KIRC, and is fre—
quently mutated in patients with KIRC (Nickerson et al., 2008;
Peﬁa—Llopis and Brugarolas, 2013; Peﬁa—Llopis et al., 2012; Sato et
al., 2013). VHL was the most frequently mutated gene in TCGA
KIRC, with 55.7% of patients harboring mutations in the gene.
TCEB1 is mutated at very low frequency in the TCGA KIRC cohort.
A recent study found that TCEB1 is mutated in ~3% of the KIRC

patients without VHL inactivation, and found TCEB1 preventing
the binding of Elongin C to VHL, which inactivates the VHL path—
way (Sato et al., 2013). The second highest ranked pathway con—
tained EP300 and TP53. EP300 and TP53 were mutated in 8.1 and
5.2% of patients, respectively. EP300 has been identified as a co—ac—
tivator of hypoxia—inducible factor 1 alpha, whose activation is a
hallmark of KIRC tumors. TP5 3 was previously found to be associ—
ated with poor outcome in TCGA KIRC (The Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network, 2013). The third highest ranked pathway con—
tains LRP1 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (MMP1,
MMP7, MMP9, MMP26). LRP1 is mutated in 10% 0f the TCGA
KIRC cohort, but matrix MMPs were not mutated in the TCGA
KIRC cohort. Biological and clinical relevance of LRP1 mutation in
KIRC has not been previously reported. MMPs have been impli—
cated in different types of cancer progression, including the acquisi—
tion of invasive and metastatic properties in many cancer types. The
aberrant expression of MMPs has been associated with poor patient
survival and prognosis in KIRC patients (Gialeli et al., 2011; Hwang
et al., 2013). Interestingly, recent studies suggested that LRP1 in—
duces the expression of matrix MMPs and thus promotes cancer cell
invasion and metastasis in many cancers, including KIRC (Duan
et al., 1995; Langlois et al., 2010; Sato et al., 2013; Staudt et al.,
2013).

NTriPath identified many new member genes in the top ranked
pathways, including TCEB2, JUN and SP1, as well as other tumor
suppressors such as CREBBP, SMAD3, BRCA1 and RB1. These
newly identified member genes by NTriPath were mutated at a very
low frequency or not mutated at all in TCGA KIRC patients.
Instead, these genes interacted with many frequently mutated genes
in the networks and were often dysregulated at the mRNA and pro—
tein levels in many KIRC patients (Fig. 2b). For example, TCEB2,
SP1 and JUN were not yet mutated but their expression was dysre—
gulated in 7, 10 and 2% of TCGA KIRC patients, respectively.
Previous studies have shown that dysregulation in TCEB2 is ex—
pected to disrupt the protein complex that ubiquitinates HIF1ot, re—
sulting in the same phenotype as VHL inactivation by mutation or
promoter hypermethylation (Duan et al., 1995; Ohh et al., 2000;
Tanimoto et al., 2000). In addition, SP1 and JUN were previously
identified as major transcriptional regulators associated with signal—
ing circuits to promote tumor growth and invasion in KIRC
(Nickerson et al., 2008). Taken together, these results show the
feasibility of NTriPath to identify altered pathways that are bio—
logically relevant to KIRC, including known cancer genes mutated
at a high or intermediate frequency in the patients, as well as genes
mutated at a very low frequency or not mutated at all yet may be
fundamental role in the development and/or progression of KIRC.

3.5 Patient stratification using cancer—type—specific
altered pathways identified by NTriPath

We hypothesized that altered mRNA expression of the member
genes in the cancer—type—specific altered pathways reﬂect the mo—
lecular basis underlying the patient clinical outcomes. This would
allow us to use mRNA expression profiles of member genes in the
altered pathways as gene signatures to stratify patients into sub—
groups with different clinical outcomes for each type of cancer. We
first collected a dataset consisting of gene expression profiles from
3656 patients with their survival information from TCGA cohorts.
Specifically, we collected TCGA RNA—seq data for 10 different can—
cer types, including KIRC, HNSC, SKCM and lower grade glioma,
from cBioPortal using the CGDS MATLAB toolbox with RNA Seq
V2 RSEM option (Gao et al., 2013). We collected microarray gene

expression profiles for TCGA GBM from the TCGA dataportal
(strel’tsov et al., 2001) and TCGA 0V and two others from Zhang
et al. (2013). We then used member genes in the top three ranked
cancer—type—specific altered pathways to perform consensus cluster—
ing for each cancer type. We generated Kaplan—Meier (KM) curves
based on the groups produced by consensus clustering and found
that patient survival was significantly different among the groups
(Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3). In TCGA KIRC, we found three
patient subgroups (A—C), with Group C having the poorest survival.
A log—rank test indicated that Groups A and C had significantly dif—
ferent survival outcomes (P—value : 1.840e — 08, Hazard
ratio : 2.94) with median survival times of 41.9 months for Group
A compared with 30.8 months for Group C (Fig. 3a). Experiments
with other TCGA datasets, including those for BLCA, HNSC and
SKCM, consistently showed that the use of member genes in cancer—
type—specific altered pathways could serve as a prognostic biomarker
for patient stratification (Fig. 3b—d, and Supplementary Figs S2 and
S3). For comparison, we also attempted to cluster patients using sig—
nificant frequently mutated genes previously identified by the TCGA
Pan—Cancer study (Kandoth et al., 2013). The results of consensus
clustering using the NTriPath—derived pathway signatures and the
TCGA Pan—Cancer—derived mutated gene signatures showed that the
results from NTriPath—derived pathway signatures had higher sig—
nificance levels (based on P—value measured by the log—rank test
across different K groups for consensus clustering) for BLAC, BRCA
and KIRC, and comparable results for the GBM, HNSC and LUAD
cancer types (Fig. 4). These findings suggested that NTriPath—
derived altered pathways could be used as prognostic biomarkers
for better patient stratification.

3.6 Independent cohorts for the validation of the cancer—
type—specific altered pathways.

We performed multiple validations to evaluate the robustness and
the reproducibility of NTriPath. First, we evaluated the robustness
of the cancer—type—specific altered pathways identified in the TCGA
cohort for prognostic stratification. We generated gene expression
profiles of 102 HNSC patients from our institution and used the

we also used publically available gene expression data from two

cancer—type specific altered pathways for the corresponding cancer
type for independent validation. In the HNSC cohorts, we found six
patient subgroups (A through F), with Group F patients having the
poorest survival times (Fig. 5a). A log—rank test indicated that
groups A and F had significantly different survival outcomes (P—

specific altered pathways. We collected the level 2 somatic mutation
data from 19 human cancer types; those were updated after we col—
lected the initial dataset used in the original experiments from the
TCGA data portal. We found that there are 1891 newly updated pa—
tients’ mutation data from 15 cancer types (see Supplementary
Table S6). We re—ran NTriPath to identify cancer—type—specific path—
ways across 19 cancers using 6681 patients’ somatic mutation data,
including those of newly updated patients’ mutation data.
Interestingly, we found that many top ranked pathways identified
by NTriPath in the original experiments were consistently highly
ranked in the new experiments (see Supplementary Table S7). These
results may reassure the feasibility of the use of the altered pathways
identified by NTriPath as potential prognostic signatures for iden—
tifying patient subgroups with different survival outcomes across
multiple cancer types.

3.7 Identification of potential therapeutic targets

in poor prognosis patient subgroups

We further investigated whether we could identify potential targets
for therapy for the identified poor prognosis patient subgroups.
Interestingly, we found that many known drug targets in the cancer—
type specific altered pathways are often up—regulated in poor prog—
nosis patient subgroups across cancers (Supplementary Table S8).
For example, in TCGA KIRC cohort, MMP9, a target of the FDA—
approved drug Captopril, was significantly up—regulated in the poor
prognosis group compared with the good prognosis group (FDR—
adjusted P—value < 0.05 with t—test). Captopril, an angiotensin—
converting enzyme inhibitor, inhibits MMP9 expression (Jones
et al., 2004; Okada et al., 2008; Williams et al., 2005; Yamamoto
et al., 2008). Therefore, the use of Captopril might be recommended
for renal cell carcinoma patients with high MMP9 levels. Another
notable example includes DNA Topoisomerase I (TOP1), a target of
well—known FDA—approved anticancer drugs such as Irinotecan and
Topotecan, identified by NTriPath as a new member gene in the
pathway containing TP53, EP300, AUKRA and CDK5. We found
that TOP1 was up—regulated in poor prognosis subgroups in HNSC
from both TCGA and UTSW cohorts. In addition, we also found
that some patients with overexpression of TOP1 in the TCGA
HNSC poor prognosis subgroup have developed therapy resistance
against single chemotherapeutic agent such as Cisplatin.
Interestingly, there is an ongoing trial in advanced HNSC showing
efficacy of TOP1 inhibitor Irinotecan with Cisplatin in a poor prog—
nosis patient subgroup (Gilbert et al., 2008). These observations
may suggest the feasibility of TOP1 inhibitors—based combinations
as an effective treatment option for HNSC patients with poor prog—
nosis and/or therapy resistance, which should be evaluated further
with multiple clinical samples.

4 Discussion

Systematic understanding of how somatic mutations inﬂuence clin—
ical outcomes is essential for the development and application of
personalized therapies. In particular, organizing alterations at the in—
dividual gene level and in the molecular pathways can correlate
altered pathways and vulnerabilities with specific genetic lesions,
and provide novel insights into cancer biology, biomarkers for pa—
tient stratification in clinical trials and potential targeted drug devel—
opment (Garraway and Lander, 2013). Here, we systematically
identified biological and clinical relevant cancer—type—specific path—
ways altered across multiple cancer types. In particular, the integra—
tion of somatic mutation with biological prior knowledge led to the

identification of altered pathways that contain recurrently mutated
genes as a hallmark of specific cancer types. We found that single
gene expression analysis, in particular those of frequently mutated
genes (e.g. TP53, EP300, BRCA1, etc.), in the commonly top—ranked
pathways across many cancer types do not show clear separation
into patient subgroups with different survival outcome. We also per—
formed KM survival analysis based on mutation status of each of
frequently mutated genes but did not find clear separation into patient
subgroups with different survival outcomes either. Interestingly, we
found that several genes, while not frequently mutated or not mutated
at all in patients, were part of cancer—type—specific altered pathways
that have been causally implicated in the development of correspond—
ing cancer types, and significantly associated with clinical outcomes
(Supplementary Fig. S5). For example, no mutation of MMP7 has
been reported, but high expression of MMP7 [P—value:0.00191,
HR: 1.7 (95% CI 1.21—2.38)] is significantly associated with poor
survival in TCGA KIRC patients. Other examples include CABLES1
[P—Value:0.00272, HR:0.486 (95% CI 0.301—0.787)] in TCGA
HNSC and LUAD, and GCH1 [P—value: 0.0000528, HR: 0.52
(95% CI 0.367—0.763)] in TCGA SKCM are not frequently or not
mutated, but low or high expression of those genes are significantly
associated with poor survival. In addition, we found that known drug
targets are not frequently mutated but often up—regulated in poor
prognosis patient subgroups across many cancers. These results fur—
ther corroborate that the integrative analysis of somatic mutations
with additional biological prior knowledge may elucidate potential
candidate genes associated with clinical outcomes and could be poten—
tially used to design targeted therapy, which cannot be readily identi—
fied by somatic mutation analysis alone. We performed additional
experiments using member genes present only in the original pathway
annotation to stratify patients and compared the performance of pa—
tient stratification to identify patient subgroups with different survival
outcomes with pathway signatures containing new member genes
identified by NTriPath. Interestingly, we found that the use of mem—
ber genes in the pathways with additional new member genes identi—
fied by NTriPath improved patient stratification results overall
(Supplementary Fig. S6 ). In our analysis, we did not remove synonym—
ous mutations or further select a shorter list of recurrent
mutated genes in cohorts with stringent criteria (Dees et al., 2012;
Lawrence et al., 2013). We performed additional experiments
exclusively using non—synonymous mutations to identify cancer—
type—specific altered pathways to stratify patients into subgroups.
Experimental results using pathway signatures identified by NTriPath
with non—synonymous mutations only and with synonymous muta—
tions to stratify patient subgroups showed comparable performance
(Supplementary Fig. S7). These findings may suggest that NTriPath—
derived altered pathways could lead to potential prognostic bio—
markers for better patient stratification. However, the clinical utility
of the altered pathways need to be rigorously validated independently
in multiple clinical samples.

To evaluate the impact of different network resources, we used
networks from the HPRD (Keshava Prasad et al., 2009) and Rossin
et al. (2011) and repeated experiments. We summarize the results of
altered pathways and patient stratification using different network
resources and provide them on our supplement website. Lastly,
NTriPath is a general computational algorithm and can be applied
to other data types such as gene expression, copy number alteration
and methylation to identify altered pathways by different types of
genomic aberrations. NTriPath can also be used to find altered path—
ways across associated with other cancer—related phenotypes (e.g.
patient groups having therapy resistance versus sensitivity, meta—
static versus non—metastatic).

5 Conclusions

We have described an integrative somatic mutation analysis for dis—
covering altered pathways in human cancers. NTriPath integrates som—
atic mutation data and prior biological knowledge from the pathway
database and molecular networks to identify significantly altered path—
ways and their associations with specific cancer types. Specifically,
NTriPath effectively utilizes mutation patterns that exist in only a sub—
set of samples (or specific cancer types), thus revealing pathways
altered by complex mutation patterns across cancer types.
Furthermore, using gene—gene interaction networks and the pathway
database provide the potential to identify altered pathways enriched
with genes harboring mutations at high/intermediate frequencies, as
well as those not mutated per se but nevertheless playing critical roles
in tumorigenesis in network and pathway contexts. Thus, NTriPath is
uniquely suited to provide a global analysis of altered pathways by
somatic mutation across cancer types. We applied NTriPath to somatic
mutation data from 19 types of cancers, and discovered cancer—type—
specific altered pathways based on these mutations in human cancers.
Functional enrichment analysis of cancer—type—specific pathways dem—
onstrated that the identified cancer—type—specific altered pathways are
biologically meaningful to each cancer type. It also provided unique
pathway views of key biological processes underlying each cancer type.
Of particular significance, we identified a patient subgroup with poor
survival by cancer—type—specific altered pathway signatures from
TCGA cohorts, which in independent cohorts. These results implied
the potential utility of cancer—type—specific altered pathway signatures
to serve as a guide to tailored treatment in a patient subgroup.

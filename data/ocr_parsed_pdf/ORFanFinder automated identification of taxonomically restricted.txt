Abstract

Motivation: Orphan genes, also known as ORFans, are newly evolved genes in a genome that
enable the organism to adapt to specific living environment. The gene content of every sequenced
genome can be classified into different age groups, based on how widely/narrowly a gene’s homo—
logs are distributed in the context of species taxonomy. Those having homologs restricted to
organisms of particulartaxonomic ranks are classified as taxonomically restricted ORFans.

Results: Implementing this idea, we have developed an open source program named ORFanFinder
and a free web server to allow automated classification of a genome’s gene content and identifica—
tion of ORFans at different taxonomic ranks. ORFanFinder and its web server will contribute to the
comparative genomics field by facilitating the study ofthe origin of new genes and the emergence

of lineage—specific traits in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

1 Introduction

ORFans stand for orphan Open Reading Frames (Fischer and
Eisenberg, 1999). In addition to ORFans, in literature orphan genes
are also known as new genes, lineage-specific genes (LSGs) and
taxonomically restricted genes (TRGs) (Tautz and Domazet—Loso,
2011), although some terms are used in very specific contexts, e.g.
(16 1101/0 originated new genes. Orphan genes (hereafter ORFans) are
new inventions of a genome that enable the organism to adapt to its
specific living environment. They are fundamentally important for
the origin of new species and the emergence of lineage-specific traits,
e.g. morphological diversity, metabolic innovation and pathogen-
icity (Chen et (11., 2013; Khalturin et (11., 2009).

ORFans are usually identified by using sequence similarity
search tools such as BLAST (Fischer and Eisenberg, 1999; Yin and
Fischer, 2006). The simple BLAST method tends to identify very
narrowly distributed ORFans and cannot classify ORFans into
groups of different ages. Therefore the phylogeny-based approach
was developed to map BLAST hits onto a species phylogeny, which
allows identifying ORFans of different ages. One method using

this approach (Daubin and Ochman, 2004) required a well-
accepted species phylogeny, often not available for non-model or-
ganisms. Another method termed phylostratigraphy approach
(Domazet—Loso et (11., 2007) also required a phylogeny, which
however is derived from the query species’ taxonomic lineage.
Although the phylostratigraphy approach was recently shown to
have some limitations (Moyers and Zhang, 2015), it has been
widely used to study ORFans in various organisms (e.g.
Carvunis et (11., 2012; Guo, 2013). However, the phylogeny-based
methods are more difficult to automate and often need human
intervention.

Here, we present a new tool ORFanFinder and its web server.
ORFanFinder is fully automated and the results are completely re-
producihle. While the algorithm hehind ORFanFinder is essentially
based on the phylostratigraphy approach (Domazet—Loso et (11.,
2007), it is more strictly formulated for the purpose of complete
automation. To our knowledge ORFanFinder is the only open
source computer software and the first online server for ORFan
identification and classification.

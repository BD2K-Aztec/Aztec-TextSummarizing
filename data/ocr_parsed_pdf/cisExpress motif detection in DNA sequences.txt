Method

cisExpress divides the motif-finding problem into two general stages:

Stage 1: Detecting ‘seed’ motifs. This stage determines consensus se-
quences of motifs and their approximate position in the promoter region.
It follows the steps of Motifer (Troukhan et al., 2009). The discovery of
motifs is performed in overlapping windows of predefined size. For every
word present in the observed window, we calculate Z-score according to
Equation 1.9 in the Supplementary Material.

Butt/70% k) _ en’itlmut(w> k)
S!d{3\'i‘ﬂh(l|’.k) S!tkr\'iﬂl’wl(l|’./{)
"ii-rm ("2 k) min/W (w. A)

Zxcore (W, k) =

      

where e,..,-,;,(w,k) and e,..,-,;,0m(w,k) are average gene expression values;
Stdev,.,,-,;,(w,k) and Stdev,.,,-,;,W,(w,k) are standard deviation of gene ex-
pression values; n,.,,-,;,(w,k) and n,.,,-,;,W,(w,k) are the number of sequences
of genes containing and not containing word w in the kth window.

Words with Z-scores above a predefined threshold are stored as
primary motifs. Groups of similar motifs discovered within one
window are then merged together resulting in longer and/or more am-
biguous motifs. This part of the method outputs the motif in the form of
a consensus sequence and includes the position of window where it was
discovered.

Stage 2: ‘Optimizing the previously obtained motifs’. In this stage, a
genetic algorithm (GA) (Holland, 1992; Wall, 2007) is applied to each of
the motifs detected in Stage 1 to determine the best possible motif model
and motif position (optimization process tries to maximize absolute value
of Z-score of the motif). The output consists of an N><4 motif matrix
(where N is the length of the motif), representing relative frequencies of
nucleotides in the motif. For each position within the motif, there is a
probability that each base occurs at that position. This representation
also includes information about motif conservation and position.
Specifications of used GA can be found in the Supplementary
Material. This stage is unique to cisExpress.

Availability: cisEXpress is available for use from www.cisexpress.org as
a stand-alone open-source application or via a web interface. The web
interface submits jobs to a high-performance computing system (currently
HPC Wales, www.hpcwales.co.uk), where the efficient parallel implemen-
tation of cisExpress ensures easy and fast access to the tool without the
requirement to install the software. In the near future, we aim to incorp-
orate our novel improved method for promoter prediction into this inter-
face. These tools will then form a pipeline.

3 RESULTS

The cisExpress algorithm was applied to 13 379 promoter regions
of the classical genetic plant model, A.thaliana, using 11 gene
expression datasets. Promoter sequences were randomly divided
into training and testing sets (in a 50:50 ratio). Sequences in
the training set were used to find the highest—scoring motifs
for each experimental condition using the cisExpress and
MatrixREDUCE (Foat et al., 2006) programs. The testing set
promoters were examined for the presence of the motifs, and
corresponding gene expression values were compared for genes
whose promoters did and did not contain the motifs, using a
t—test. A full description of the benchmark is given in the
Supplementary Material. Most of the motifs identiﬁed by the
two programs are those previously identiﬁed and well character—
ized in promoters of A.thaliana. For example, CACGTG is
an abscisic acid responsive element—like binding site motif
involved in both dehydration—related and low—temperature—
responsive gene expression. The 5/—TATAAA—3/ DNA sequence
(TATA)—box is typically associated with the variability of gene

expression, including tissue and stress specificity (Troukhan
et a[., 2009). CATGC, detected in the SEEDS and FLOWERS
sets, is a canonical RY (RY element, having a typical sequence
CATGCATG, is conserved in the promoter regions of the genes
of legume seed storage proteins) seed—specific motif. Motifs
GGCCC in core promoter regions of activated genes were pre—
viously observed (Molina and Grotewold, 2005). Motif CTAGA,
associated with the Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein
phosphatsase 2A, TORl repeats (HEAT) dataset, is a putative
response element for multiprotein bridging factor 1 (MBFl),
which controls the expression of 36 different transcripts during
heat stress (Suzuki et al., 2011). Motif AGGCC (identified as
important for gene expression under NITROGEN stress) is
bound by a group of transcription factors known as the TCP
[teosinte branched 1 (TBl), cycloidea (CYC), proliferating cell
factors 1 and 2 (PCFl and PCF2)] family (Walley et al., 2011). A
comparison between MatrixREDUCE and cisExpress for 11
gene expression datasets is given in Table 1. For each experimen—
tal condition, Table 1 shows consensus sequence of the best 5—nt
motif, position of the motif (for cisExpress) and P—value of the t—
test. This shows that cisExpress is capable of detecting position
weight matrices that are more specific and that result in lower t—
test P—values across all analyzed conditions. cisExpress is able to
outperform MatrixREDUCE owing to its use of motif position
information and the addition of the GA optimization step to
tune position weight matrices. The high performance computing
back—end and efficient parallel implementation of the code also
allows cisExpress to handle large datasets, such as those gener—
ated by publicly accessible whole genome and transcriptome pro—
jects. For the A.thaliana benchmark used in Table 1 (consisting
of 98 discrete tasks to distribute among the available computa—
tional cores), the parallel strategy reduces execution time for the
motif detecting part of the algorithm by a factor of 18.5 within a
(64—core) node. For a larger dataset (with far more tasks than
available cores), better parallel scaling would be expected.
Complete parallel performance results for cisExpress are pre—
sented in Supplementary Material. In conclusion, we demon—
strated the robust nature and validity of the cisExpress
algorithm. cisExpress is an organism—independent tool and it is
applicable for use with a wide range of genomic databases.

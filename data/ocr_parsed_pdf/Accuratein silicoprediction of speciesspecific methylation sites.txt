Abstract

As one of the most important reversible types of post—translational modification, protein methyla—
tion catalyzed by methyltransferases carries many pivotal biological functions as well as many es—
sential biological processes. Identification of methylation sites is prerequisite for decoding methy—
lation regulatory networks in living cells and understanding their physiological roles. Experimental
methods are limitations of labor—intensive and time—consuming. While in silicon approaches are
cost—effective and high—throughput manner to predict potential methylation sites, but those previ—
ous predictors only have a mixed model and their prediction performances are not fully satisfac—
tory now. Recently, with increasing availability of quantitative methylation datasets in diverse spe—
cies (especially in eukaryotes), there is a growing need to develop a species—specific predictor.
Here, we designed a tool named PSSMe based on information gain (IG) feature optimization
method for species—specific methylation site prediction. The IG method was adopted to analyze the
importance and contribution of each feature, then select the valuable dimension feature vectors to
reconstitute a new orderly feature, which was applied to build the finally prediction model. Finally,
our method improves prediction performance of accuracy about 15% comparing with single fea—
tures. Furthermore, our species—specific model significantly improves the predictive performance
compare with other general methylation prediction tools. Hence, our prediction results serve as
useful resources to elucidate the mechanism of arginine or lysine methylation and facilitate
hypothesis—driven experimental design and validation.

diseases such as cancer (Aleta et (11., 1998; Wang et (11., 2009), car—
diovascular disease (Yang and Bedford, 2013), multiple sclerosis
(Mastronardi et (11., 2006), rheumatoid arthritis (Suzuki et (11.,
2007), as well as neuroses generative disorders (Longo and
Kennedy, 2006). Therefore, annotation of methylation in proteomes
would certainly provide very useful information or clues for drug
discovery to study and analyze the mechanisms that govern these
basic epigenetic phenomena.

Identification of methylated sites is the first step towards to
understanding molecular mechanism of protein methylation.
Although there have many conventional experimental methods to
identify protein methylation sites, such as Chip—Chip (Johnson
et (11., 2008), mass spectrometry (MS) (Ong et (11., 2004) and
methylation—specific antibodies (Boisvert et (11., 2003), these experi—
mental approaches are limited to labor—intensive and time—
consuming. While in silicon prediction of methylation sites is much
more desirable for its convenience and fast speed, and there have
been several tools published for prediction protein methylated sites.
Recently, our lab (Shi et (11., 2015) have systematically summarized
current of computational prediction methylation sites method of
the past ten years. Furthermore, we have also summarized charac—
teristic of differences among several typical tools (the detailed infor—
mation in Supplementary Table S1), including MeMo (Chen et (11.,
2006), BPB—PPMS (Shao et (11., 2009), MASA (Shien et (11., 2009),
PMeS (Shi et (11., 2012), PLMLA (Shi et (11., 2012), MethK (Lee
et (11., 2014), iMethyl—PseAAC (Qiu et (11., 2014) and GPS—MSP
(Deng et (11., 2016). For instance, Plewczynski et al. (2005) designed
the first methylation sites predictor within their AutoMotif Server
using regular expression technique. Subsequently, Shao et al.
(2009) combined Bi—profile Bayes feature extraction with support
vector machine (SVM) to predict arginine and lysine methylation.
Based on an enhanced feature encoding scheme (composed of the
sparse property coding, normalized van der Waals volume, position
weight amino and accessible surface area), our lab developed a tool
PMeS (Shi et (11., 2012) to predict arginine and lysine methylation.
Meanwhile Shi et al. (2012) incorporated protein sequence infor—
mation, secondary structure and amino acid properties to identify
methylation and acetylation of lysine residues in whole protein se—
quences. Lee et al. (2014) used amino acid composition (AAC) and
accessible surface area (ASA) coalition SVM to identify lysine—
methylated sites on histones and non—histone proteins. Most re—
cently, Deng et al. (2016) adopted GPS 3.0 algorithm and built
GPS—MSP (Methyl—group Specific Predictor) for the prediction of
general or type—specific methyllysine and methylarginine residues in
proteins.

Although each of the aforementioned methods possesses its own
merit and did play roles in stimulating the development of this area,
they still have limitations when applied to whole proteomes and need
improvement from one or more of the following aspects: (i) The
benchmark dataset used by the previous investigators needs to updated
by incorporating new experiment—confirmed data, because methyla—
tion data updated very quickly in recent years. For example, Lee et al.
(2014) created MethK model just with 1306 methyllysine sites at
2013, whereas our work have found 3180 lysine methylation sites in
total. (ii) The features used by the previous models were single and
simple, which it is casing the performance of the several aforemen—
tioned predictors not fully satisfactory, so there is still room to im—
prove the predictive accuracy (the detailed information see comparison
with other general prediction tools in results and discussion). (iii) The
third limitation is that the methylation specific classification (species
or methyltransferase family) was not discussed in previous methods.
The majority of existing studies except GPS—MSP disregarded the

differences of species and considered all species methylation sites as
generic sites to build a mixed model. However, sequences or structural
patterns around the methylation sites may significantly differ in differ—
ent organisms, so it highlighting necessity to develop species—specific
predictors. (iv) Furthermore, some of these tools were only published
as a method and did not provide a user—friendly web service or the
web server does not work (Xu et (11., 2013; Zhang et (11., 2013). The
tools with web services are useful for user to predict methylation sites
when they want to experimental design and verify whether sequence is
methylated, especially for large—scale predictions.

Protein methylation site prediction has not been as widely
studied as other types of PTM (such as phosphorylation and acetyl—
ation) due to lack of methylation data. With techniques rapidly
increasing in the past few years, the growing number of methylation
datasets was found in diverse species (especially in eukaryotes). For
example, Lott et al. (2014) found over 800 arginine methylated pro—
teins in an early—branching eukaryote Trypanosoma brucei. Li et al.
(2014) collected 6449 methylation sites with species information in
3237 experimentally validated methylated proteins in SysPTM 2.0.
Protein methylation has attracted more and more attentions, there is
a growing need to develop a species—specific predictor. In this work,
we developed a new tool named PSSMe (prediction species—specific
methylation sites) to overcome above limitations of the existing
methods, which is specifically designed to predict both species—
specific and general methylation sites. Reliable and large—scale ex—
perimental methylation sites data from multiple species were col—
lected from several sources which used to train for building the
species—specific models. In particular, our model first used a well—
established feature selection method IG (Huang and Berger, 2008)
coupled with a two stage to distinguish the importance and valuable
dimension feature vector, which it is more simple and convenient
comparison with other selection and optimization methods (such as
the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) method)
(Peng et (11., 2005), The first—stage selects five features, including
amino acid compositions (AAC), K—spaced amino acid pair compos—
ition, amino acids binary encoding (BE), K Nearest Neighbors fea—
tures (KNN) and amino acid physicochemical property (PSP)
features. The second—stage incorporates five features and finds most
valuable dimension features based on information gain (IG) method,
and then reconstitute a new orderly features to build the model for
methylation sites prediction. After prediction of independent test
dataset, the result showed that our prediction performance overall
significantly enhance than other tools.

Furthermore, we discussed the model of methylation in different
species; the analysis result shows the following: (i) the methylation
patterns are significantly different in different species. (ii) IG method
can effectively select valuable dimension features and reduce redun—
dant features for improving the prediction performance. (iii) Based
on IG score, it suggests that KNN feature is important and makes a
great contribution for prediction methylation sites. (iv) Finally, the
web service of PSSMe supports continuous stringency adjustment to
meet the various confidence requirements of user’s cross—validation
tests and provides better probability information for prediction re—
sults by comparison with other prediction tools.

2 Methods

2.1 Data collection and preprocessing

Methylation is predominantly found on lysine and arginine residues,
of which arginine methylation data were composed of three species:
H.5apiens (human), M.musculus (mouse) and R.norvegicus (rat).

9103 ‘Og JSanV uo sajaﬁuv soc] ‘BIIIJOJIIBD JO AJtSJQAtuf] 112 /310'S[Buln0prOJXO'SOIJBLUJOJIIIOIq/ﬂdnq 11101} pQPBOIIIAAOG

Prediction of species—specific methylation sites

 

And lysine methylation data were also collected from three species:
H.5apiens (human), M.musculus (mouse) and the others eukaryotes
(i.e. yeast, cow, sheep and so on). The data were mainly extracted
from several database sources including PhosphoSite (March 1,
2015) (Hornbeck et (11., 2004), UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot (March 1,
2015) (Chernorudskiy et (11., 2007), SYSPTM (Li et (11., 2014),
dbPTM (Lee et (11., 2006), CPLM databases (Liu et (11., 2013) as well
as the relevant literatures. From the literatures in recent years, we
found 287 methylarginine sites and 57 methyllysine sites which have
been experimentally verified and were not collected in databases.
Totally, the original dataset of methylarginine contained 3550 pro—
teins including 7198 methylated sites, of which 3603 sites were
found from human, 2931 sites from mouse and 425 sites were from
rat (detailed information in Supplementary Table S2). Similarly, the
methyllysine dataset contained 3180 methylated sites from 1764 ly—
sine proteins in different species. Among them, we found 2045
methylated sites from human, 289 methylated sites from mouse,
while 480 methylated sites from the other eukaryotes in all. Because
methylation dataset from several sources may own a high protein se—
quences homology, we need cluster the protein sequences from data—
set with a threshold of 30% identity by CD—HIT (Li and Godzik,
2006) to eliminate homology protein sequences. Afterward, we got
the non—redundant species methylation datasets, and then randomly
selected 30 arginine and lysine proteins containing methylated sites,
respectively, to use as the independent data for different species
model testing. The remaining 2980, 2644, 321 arginine methylation
sites as well as 1741, 186, 173 lysine methylation sites of various
species were used to construct our training models, respectively.
Finally, numbers of methylation sites for arginine and lysine differ—
ent species model training and testing are shown in Supplementary
Table S3 (the detailed training methylation set in Supplementary
Data S1 and Data S2).

2.2 Features extraction and optimization

As heterogeneous features used to predict PTMs sites in silicon are
often noisy and redundant leading to an adverse impact on model
training, such as decreasing performance, a time—consuming train
classifiers and possibly biased model prediction, thus features opti—
mization is very necessary. In our study, a new method IG was
adopted to select and optimize multi—features, which can effectively
remove redundant features and significantly improve the predictive
performance. In the first—stage, we selected some features from
which have been evidenced good performances for prediction PTMs
sites. After the preliminary evaluation testing of SVM (SVM infor—
mation in Supplementary Ep1), we selected the five features which
can effectively predictive methylation sites. These features are the
amino acid composition (AAC), binary encoding (BE), K—spaced
amino acid pair composition (K—spaced), K Nearest Neighbors
(KNN) features and physicochemical properties (PSP). The detailed
feature information is following (the K—spaced and BE feature infor—
mation in Supplementary Ep2):

2.2.1 AAC

Amino acid composition feature is the most popular coding method
and widely used for prediction PTMs sites (such as phosphorylation
and acetylation) (Suo et (11., 2012), which reﬂects protein sequences
amino acid occurrence frequencies information. In this work, AAC
is the fraction of each type of amino acid in a sequence fragment, we
calculated amino acid occurrence frequencies in the sequence sur—
rounding the query site (the site itself is not counted). There are 20

types of amino acids, and thus 20 frequencies are calculated, the
sum of which is 1.

2.2.2 KNN

Local sequence clusters often exist around methylation site because
substrate sites of same methyltransferases usually share similar pat—
terns in local sequence fragments (Kennelly and Krebs, 1995). We
used the local sequence around a possible methylation site in a query
protein and extracted features from similar sequences in both the
positive and negative sets by a KNN algorithm. For example, two
local sequences, 51 : [51 (i)] and $2: [52 (i)] define the distance Dist

where 17 represents the length of a protein sequence; Sim, the amino
acid similarity matrix, is derived from the BLOSUM62 substitution
matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992); a and b are two amino acids,
M is the substitution matrix and max/min{M} represent the largest/
smallest number in the matrix, respectively.

2.2.3 PSP

Physicochemical property is the most intuitive feature for biochemical
properties, the specificity and diversity of structure and function of
proteins depend to a large extent on various properties of each of the
amino acids. A large body of experimental and theoretical researches
has been performed to characterize different kinds of properties of in—
dividual amino acids and represent them in terms of the numerical
index (Tomii and Kanehisa, 1996). Version 9.1 of Amino Acid index
database (AAindex) (Kawashima and Kanehisa, 2000) is containing
total 544 amino acid indices physicochemical and biochemical proper—
ties of 20 amino acids. Furthermore, PSP has been successfully applied
to predict such protein modification as phosphorylation, acetylation.
Moreover, Shi et al. (2012) and Lee et al. (2014) also have shown that
the feature set of PSP is one of best type of feature for predicting
methylation sites. Thus, in our work, comparing the prediction accur—
acy of all PSP, then the top three were selected and defined as inform—
ative features for the prediction model. The detailed informative of
PSP in different model is shown in Supplementary Table S4.

2.2.4 1G

The second—stage is selection and optimization aforementioned five
features to find the most valuable dimension feature vectors for
building the prediction model. In fact, compared to the single fea—
ture, the combination of features can reﬂect more protein sequence
information leading to a certain improvement of prediction per—
formance. However, the combination of complex features is highly
dimensional, redundant, heterogeneous and noisy, which would
lead to a time—consuming practice to train classifiers and possibly
biased model prediction. In this stage, we analyzed all dimension
feature vectors of five features based on IG method, then distin—
guished the importance and contribution features. We selected this
valuable dimension feature vectors to reconstitute a new orderly fea—
tures which employed for methylation sites prediction. The IG
method could effectively select valuable dimension feature vectors
and significantly improve the predictive performance. The detailed
theory of IG method is following.

Information gain measures the decrease in entropy when a given
feature is used to group values of another (class) feature. The en—
tropy of a feature X is defined as

M) : —ZP<x.>Iog2<P<x.->> <3>

where [x,-] is a set of values of X and P (x,) is the prior probability
of x,. The conditional entropy of X, given another feature Y is
defined as

H<X1Y> : — Z Po.) Z P<xiiyi>log2<P<xiiyi>> <4>
j i

where P (x,- ) 31,-) is the posterior probability of X given the value y,- of
Y. The amount by which the entropy of X decreases reﬂects add—
itional information about X provided by Y and is called information
gain

IG(X\Y) : H(X) — H(X\Y) (5)

According to the above theory, we can draw the conclusion that
the larger the value of IG, the greater the impact of the correspond—
ing features vector for prediction methylation site.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Analysis of sequence information results

First, we used the sample logo to analyze sequence structural infor—
mation to determine statistically significant residues surrounding
methylation sites. In order to identify distinct patterns or conserved
sequence motifs between methylation and non—methylation proteins,
we applied Two Sample Logo tool (Vacic et (11., 2006) to generate
sequence logos (Fig. 1) for the arginine/lysine methylation sequence
with three different species based on the curated datasets. From the
sequence logo, the amino acid residues that significantly enriched
and depleted around arginine/lysine methylation sequence were eas—
ily identified. We find methylation sequence very similar in three dif—
ferent species, where ‘G’ (glycine) is primary acid residue and tends
to appear across all positions. However, there is a slight difference
in three species sequence logo. For example, ‘P’ (proline) at pos—
ition +4 only found in human and mouse sequence, whereas residue

a

is not favored in rat sequence. In contrast, residue‘P is favored at
position —3 in rat, whereas not favored in human and mouse se—
quence. For the lysine methylation sequence logo, in Figure 1B, we
observed that this sequence residue is more significant difference
than arginine sequence in different species. In the human sequence,
‘R’ (arginine) residue tends to enrich at position —7, —6, —1, +1, +4
and +8, whereas it does not appear in mouse sequence and tends to
deplet at position —4 and +7 in the others eukaryotes sequence.
Another example is that at position —1 and +1 the residue diverse in
three species sequence, the human sequence main residue is ‘R’ and
the others eukaryotes sequence are ‘F’ (phenylalanine) and ‘Y’ (tyro—
sine) residues, whereas there are significant enriched ‘S’ (serine) and
‘G’ residue in mouse sequence. The sequence logo suggested that
methylation and non—methylation fragments have a considerable dif—
ference among the species sequence. Altogether, the result highlights
the necessity and significance of addressing the task of precise argin—
ine and lysine methylation site recognition by developing species—
specific predictors.

Second, we investigated the difference of the AAC between
methylation and non—methylation sequence in different species. In
Figure 2, from left to right, the upper amino acid residues mean

that enriched in methylation sequence, whereas other underside
amino acids are depleted. For arginine methylation sequences, in
Figure 2A, with a slight tendency of distinctions among different
species, the overall trends are very similar. Amino acids Gly, Phe,
Met, Pro and Tyr are enriched in the methylation sequences,
whereas Glu, Lys, Asp, Cys, Ile, Thr, Val and Trp are depleted.
However, there are also some differences in diverse species. One
example is that amino acids Pro and Tyr have significant difference
between methylation and non—methylation sequences favored in
rat, but have no distinction in human and mouse sequences. For
lysine methylation, in Figure 2B, AAC distinctions are pretty
obvious among three different species, and the amino acid residues
of enriched and depleted were also easily identified. For instance,
amino acid Cys and Tyr in mouse methylation sequences are
depleted, while they are enriched in other two species sequences.
Furthermore, amino acids Ala, Trp, Val, Pro, Lys, Asp and Arg
are enriched or depleted in human and mouse sequences, whereas
in the others eukaryotes model amino acids sequences is
more probable opposite. These results show that AAC were obvi—
ous distinction between methylation and non—methylation se—
quence, which it could be a helpful feature for methylation
prediction.

3.2 Analysis of evolutionary features results

Evolutionary information is an important characteristic of protein,
in the field, KNN feature was used to quantify the evolutionary con—
servative information. The KNN feature has been successfully used
for prediction PTM sites such as phosphorylation (Gao et (11., 2010)
and ubiquitylation (Chen et (11., 2013) sites. KNN score measures
whether the local sequence surrounding a query site is more similar
to the sequences containing methylation sites in the positive set or
those with non—methylation sites in the negative set. When the score
greater than 0.5 means the query site is more likely to the positive
set, while score smaller than 0.5 means it is more similar to the nega—
tive set. The larger the KNN score, the more similar the site is to
some known methylation sites, and thus, the more likely it is a

methylation site. In Figure 3, we compared the KNN scores of
methylation sites with those of non—methylation sites (due to the gap
of data, we selected different [2 values and comparison sets;
Supplementary Table S5). As can be seen in Figure 3A, the KNN
score has significant difference among various values of k in human
methylarginine and non—methylation sequences, the methylation site
scores are within 0.6—0.7, whereas non—methylation scores are
around 0.4—0.5. For KNN scores of three different species in methyl—
arginine, the average KNN scores of methylation sites with different
sizes of nearest neighbors are within 0.6—0.75 for all three organ—
isms. For non—methylation, the average KNN scores are around 0.
35—0.5. The same to methyllysine, from in Figure 3B, we found the
lysine methylation average KNN scores are within 0.5—0.7 for all
three organisms and the average scores of non—methylation are
around 0.35—0.5, respectively. Overall, methylation sites have larger
KNN scores than non—methylation sites. These analyses show that
the local sequences surrounding known methylation sites are more
similar to their nearest neighbors in the positive set (excluding self—
matches) on average as expected, but the sequences in the negative
set are not predominantly more similar to nearest neighbors in either
the non—methylation or negative set. These similarities are not due to
protein homology or the global sequence similarity, because any
two proteins in our comparison datasets are either insignificant or
low. Also, the result confirms that methylation—related clusters exist
in regional sequences around methylation sites. For non—methylation
sites, the average KNN scores are minimal, because methylation—
related sequence clusters are unlikely to exist in the negative set.
Thus, the sequences in the negative set have a similar chance to find
close neighbors in either the positive or negative set. In short, KNN
scores capture the cluster information in the local sequence around
methylation sites and hence distinguish them from the background.
Therefore, KNN scores are suitable to be used as a feature for pre—
diction methylation site.

KNN feature is very effective for predicting both general and
species—specific methylation sites. For methylation site predictions,
KNN feature relies on similarity of local sequence substrates of a
common methylation—related enzyme family to automatically distin—
guish whether site is methylation or not. Although most known

methylation sites have no annotation about their sequence substrates
of corresponding enzymes family, KNN features can still use the in—
herent cluster information in them. Oftentimes, one enzyme corres—
ponds to multiple local sequence motifs, and using a single sequence
profile may not be as effective as KNN, which better handles diverse
sequence clusters.

3.3 Analysis of physicochemical properties results
Physicochemical property is the most intuitive feature applied in
PTMs prediction studies. From the previous work, Shi et a1. (2012)
and Lee et a1. (2014) used solvent accessible surface area (ASA) (one
of physicochemical properties) coding feature and have been evi—
denced PSP plays an important role for prediction methylation sites.
Because the physicochemical property has a total of 544 (if we se—
lected all PSP of features that would highly dimensional, heteroge—
neous, noisy and time—consuming classification of the training
model), we compared the prediction accuracy of all PSP and only se—
lected top three to define as informative features for the prediction
model. As can be seen from Supplementary Figure S2, one of the
specific examples of informative PSP in arginine mouse model was
provided. We calculated the mean values of physicochemical prop—
erty ‘Thermodynamic beta sheet propensity’ (KIMC930101) at each
position in methylation and non—methylation sequences.
Interestingly, we found mean values of this property in methyla—
tion sequences is higher than in the non—methylation at all the pos—
itions, especially at the near the central sites (the positions —1, +1
and +2) the phenomenon is more remarkable. This property
features could easily distinguish the methylation or non—methylation
sequences, which is suitable for prediction methylation sites
(compare with other PSP, this feature have higher prediction accur—
acy). Furthermore, the selected optimal features of PSP differed,
depending on the species of interest. The detailed information of
selected top three PSP in different species see Supplementary
Table S3.

3.4 Analysis of feature optimization results

3.4.1 The features optimization results

The selected five features (AAC, BE, K—spaced, KNN feature and
PSP) were independent coding tests for prediction methylation sites,
which the performances are not fully satisfactory. However, com—
pare with single feature, the combination of different five features
would provide a more powerful predictor. If we combine all of five
features that have totally 2245—dimensional features vector (detailed
five features dimensional information in Supplementary Table S6).
The highly dimensional features which will lead to a time—
consuming classification of the training model, some of features vec—
tor may unwanted noise and possibly biased model prediction per—
formance. Accordingly, not all features are equivalently important
for the performance of the trained model, so optimization of incor—
porative features is generally necessary to reduce dimensionality but
keep important one. In this work, we first apply IG method to select
the valuable dimension feature vectors to reconstitute a new pseudo
amino acid composition feature. After first—stage of feature selec—
tion, we combined all of five features which totally have 2245—di—
mensional feature vectors. Subsequently, we find that the IG score
have a quite different in each dimension. We know a higher IG score
means that it is a more valuable vector based on the IG theories.
Then we select IG score top 400 vectors from 2245—dimensional fea—
ture vectors and reconstitute it a new orderly feature (from low to
high of IG score) named as the ‘Final feature’. The prediction per—
formance of used single five features and the ‘Final feature’ for pre—
diction methylation sites are shown in Figure 4, and we found the
‘Final feature’ have better prediction performance than other single
feature. One of example that the accuracy of mouse lysine methyla—
tion prediction model used single five features (AAC, BE, K—spaced,
KNN feature and PSP) are 66.39%, 61.02%, 67.47%, 68.01% and
65.86%, respectively (The other species of five features prediction
performance detailed information in Supplementary Tables S7 and
S8). While when we applied ‘Final feature’ for prediction, the accur—
acy is 81.18%. Comparing with single five features, which improved
accuracy are 14.79%, 20.16%, 13.71%, 13.17% and 15.32%, re—
spectively. The result shows that the IG method could effectively ex—
tract those important valuable dimension vectors from multi—
features for methylation sites prediction, which have significantly
improvement of prediction accuracy about 15%.

3.4.2 Analysis of feature importance and contribution

As mentioned previously, the five features sets (AAC, BE, K—spaced,
KNN feature and PSP) were selected to predict methylation sites.
We do not know the five features make how much contribution and
which is more importance than others. However, we adopted IG
method to analyze features importance and contribution, and eval—
uated which dimensions features vectors are valuable to prediction
model. For example, for human arginine methylation (the IG score
of 2245—dimensional feature vector is shown in Supplementary Fig.
S3), we found that IG score of KNN 5—dimensions is significantly
higher than other four features dimensions vector, suggesting that
KNN features play significant roles in determining the prediction
performance of the model and make a great contribution to pre—
dict methylation sites. In fact, methylation histones possess highly
conserved sequences in most species. The KNN feature is related
to conserved residues and protein evolutionary information,
which has good prediction performance in this model. In contrast,
most of IG score values of K—spaced and BE features dimensions vec—
tor are low, which suggest that most of dimension features is un—
wanted and this two features are not importance as KNN feature for
the model.

We additionally discuss the constitution of finally dimensions
features vector, which is various at different species model. These
analyses show that the number of optimal dimensional features se—
lected from five features was differed, depending on the species of
interest. Detailed information of our results is presented in
Supplementary Table S9. Taking human lysine methylation as an ex—
ample, the reconstitution of 400—dimension new feature from afore—
mentioned five features (AAC, BE, K—spaced, KNN feature and
PSP), and the rations of selected dimension feature vectors belonging
to the five features group are 0.7 (14/20), 0.09 (38/399), 0.16 (289/
1746), 1 (5/5) and 0.95 (54/57), respectively. From these results, we
discover that most of dimension feature vectors from AAC, PSP and
KNN three features are valuable and make a contribution to predic—
tion model, while the other two features BE and K—spaced have
many unwanted or redundant dimension vectors. These suggest that
compared with BE and K—spaced features, the other three features
are more importance to this model. Furthermore, considering the
features optimization results in different species, therefore, we ex—
pect that IG method fully consider the importance and contribution
of each dimension feature vectors, which can obtain the higher pre—
diction accuracy.

3.5 Species—specific methylation site prediction of
PSSMe

The proposed PSSMe predictor trained and tested for arginine and
lysine methylation has four models based on IG method optimiza—
tions features, respectively. To evaluate the performance of PSSMe
for species—specific methylation site prediction, we performed a 10—
fold cross—validation test in each species. Sensitivity at different spe—
cificity levels in each cross—validation were calculated according to
Supplementary Ep3. By taking different thresholds, then we plotted

the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculated
the AUC as shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Three arginine
methylation models of human, mouse and rat are achieved under
ROC curves (AUC) of 0.846, 0.864 and 0.853, respectively.
Similarly, three lysine methylation models of human, mouse and the
other eukaryotes achieved AUC of 0.844, 0.856 and 0.867, respect—
ively. From the ROC curves, we knew that those models have good
confident predictions with high specificities, especially for the argin—
ine mouse model, the prediction sensitivities reached 58% at the
90% specificity level, and 30% at the 95% specificity level.
Furthermore, the AUC of models of arginine combined and lysine
combined achieved of 0.851 and 0.834, respectively. The PSSMe
model was testing by 10—fold cross—validation, which has stabled
prediction performance. In contrast, we take a testing for cross—
species prediction for methylation sites, but the results of prediction
is not fully satisfactory and achieved lower specificities and AUC
scores. In summary, these justify our PSSMe general and species—
specific predictor model have stabilization and good prediction
performance.

3.6 Comparison with other prediction tools

To further evaluate the performance of PSSMe prediction methyla—
tion site, we compared it with some existing widely used arginine
and lysine methylation prediction tools. Although there have been
reported many tools for predicting protein methylation sites since
2005, considering the web server tools whether do work or not, four
general tools and one species—specific predictor GPS—MSP were se—
lected to compare the arginine and lysine models, respectively. The
comparison of general arginine methylation predictors are MeMo,
BPB—PPMS, PMeS and iMethyl—PseAAC, while the comparison of ly—
sine methylation tools are MeMo, PLMLA, PMeS and MethK.
Because the training data used to build these tools were collected
from different databases, the prediction performance varies greatly
among them. To avoid any bias, in this work, the additional inde—
pendent test dataset was applied in the cross—species prediction
evaluation. We submitted each species test dataset to MeMo, BPB—
PPMS, PMeS and iMethyl—PseAAC tools for prediction arginine
methylation site. From the results (Table 1), PSSMe achieves signifi—
cantly higher AUC values than other four tools (the ROC perform—
ance comparison of our model with other tools in Supplementary
Figs. S5 and S6). For arginine methylation model, AUC values of the
prediction performance of PSSMe are 0.870, 0.893 and 0.978 in
human, mouse and rat model, respectively. Comparing with MeMo
(the AUC values is 0.683), our three model improved the AUC val—
ues are 0.187, 0.21 and 0.295, respectively. In addition to the AUC
value comparison, we also calculated the MCC, sensitivity and spe—
cificity, as shown in Table 1. BPB—PPMS and iMethyl—PseAAC tools
can achieve high specificity along with sacrificing sensitivity, which
would case a low MCC and AUC values. PMeS have a good balance
between specificity and sensitivity, but the MCC and AUC of predic—
tion performance are not fully satisfactory. However, PSSMe not
only offers good sensitivity as well as high specificity, but also have
higher AUC and MCC values. One of the examples for human ar—
ginine model, the prediction performance is sensitivity of 83.3%,
specificity of 91.0%, accuracy of 87.1%, MCC of 0.745 and AUC
of 0.870, while other four approaches have lower values. It shows
that species—specific PSSMe outperforms general tools.

For the lysine methylation tools, we made a comparison of pre—
diction to the species of human, mouse and the others eukaryotes.
The performance of PSSMe and other four tools predict independent
test methylation dataset are shown in Table 2. We found that

MeMo and PMeS tools have high specificity meanwhile sacrificing
sensitivity, the AUC and MCC are not good when prediction human
and mouse methylation sites. PLMLA and MethK have a good bal—
ance of prediction performance, but comparison with PSSMe, which
our prediction result is better. For example, the performances of
MethK for prediction human lysine methylation are sensitivity of
72.7%, specificity of 96.9%, accuracy of 84.8%, MCC of 0.718
and AUC of 0.85 8, while the performances of our tool are sensitivity
of 98.4%, specificity of 96.9%, accuracy of 97.7%, MCC of 0.954
and AUC of 0.969. Meanwhile, MethK have not good performances
when used to predict the other eukaryotes methylated sites, while
PSSMe have significantly improvement of sensitivity and AUC val—
ues for species—specific methylation site prediction. In addition, we
compared PSSMe arginine and lysine combined models with other
four tools for methylation sites, respectively. The detailed

information of result is listed in Supplementary Table S10; PSSMe
arginine combined models improved the AUC values of 0.244, 0.
331, 0.328 and 0.374 than MeMo, BPB—PPMS, PMeS and iMethyl—
PseAAC, respectively. Similarly, PSSMe lysine combined models im—
proved the AUC values of 0.233, 0.342, 0.154 and 0.039 than
MeMo, PLMLA, PMeS and MethK, respectively. What is more, we
also compared with other species—specific predictor GPS—MSP,
which is developed by the author of MeMo. First, in order to make
the results comparable, sensitivities of GPS—MSP and PSSMe were
set to 0.5. Then, we submitted species—specific independent test data—
set to GPS—MSP model for prediction methylation site, and the re—
sults are shown in Tables 1 and 2. We found that comparison with
other general prediction tools, prediction performances of species—
specific models PSSMe and GPS—MSP have outperformed. Take ar—
ginine human model as an example, PSSMe and GPS—MSP achieved
significantly higher AUC values than other four general tools, it is
evidenced that developing a species—specific predictors is necessary.
Meanwhile, comparing with species—specific prediction methylation
sites, PSSMe have outperformed GPS—MSP. For example, for lysine
methylation rat model, our model could more accurately predict
methylation than GPS—MSP. It is show that PSSMe has good predic—
tion performance for species—specific prediction methylation sites.

The reason that PSSMe outperforms other predictors is mainly
following: (i) the data sources of the experimental methylation sites
for the previous tools was collected mainly from UniProtKB/Swiss—
Prot and it may bias on some special species (most of earlier methy—
lation data were collected from human protein and only a few hun—
dred methylated proteins). The little data may case a bias
classification of the training model and are not suitable for predict—
ing all species. However, PSSMe integrated 8100 experimental
methylation sites from multiple resources, which have been accumu—
lated the methylation data from thousands of proteins in different
species. (ii) The BPB—PPMS and iMethyl—PseAAC tools have low
AUC that is partly attributed to using the single feature, which could
not extract fully features information from methylation sequences.
In contrast, PSSMe integrated five features to ensure the complete
extraction of sequence information, further conducted multi—
features selection and optimization based on IG method. Finally,
analysis of each features contribution and importance found valu—
able dimensions feature vector to build the model for prediction
methylation sites. (iii) When performing the comparisons, we used a
prediction model that was trained from a dataset excluding the pro—
tein sequences in the independent test dataset. However, for com—
parison tools, some of the test proteins might have been included in
their training processes, and thus prediction performances may be
biased favorably toward these tools in the comparisons. This possi—
bility implies that the performance improvement of over these tools
might be underestimated.

4 Conclusion

This is the study which classifies proteins into species—specific to
identify potential arginine and lysine methylation sites. We not only
demonstrated that PSSMe both general and species—specific models
have stabilization and good prediction performance, but also
showed that our models significantly improved the prediction results
compared to previous mixed model. Our analysis shows the methy—
lation patterns are significantly different in different species, and fea—
ture optimization by using IG method indicates that KNN feature is
important and makes a great contribution for prediction model.
Furthermore, we have developed a user—friendly web server, PSSMe,

to implement the described methylation site prediction, which could
be especially useful for some hypothesis—driven experiments.
However, our method still has certain limitations, which are com—
mon to almost all computational prediction tools. For example, the
methylation data that we have found only labeled positive data,
while the negative data have no any evidenced to labeled, which
may affect the prediction performance. It will be resolved in the fu—
ture with techniques rapidly increasing, we will develop some novel
models for specific prediction methylation sites. In conclusion, we
believe that PSSMe could serve as a powerful and complementary
tool for in vivo or in vitro species—specific methylation site identifica—
tion. Additionally, the combination of computational analyses with
experimental verification could greatly speed up our systematic
understanding of the methylation mechanisms and explore the cor—
responding regulatory networks in living cells.

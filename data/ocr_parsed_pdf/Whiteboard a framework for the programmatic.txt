Abstract

Summary: Whiteboard is a class library implemented in C++ that enables visualization to be
tightly coupled with computation when analyzing large and complex datasets.

1 Introduction

A key aspect in understanding complex biological or medical
systems lies in visualizing the data, which allows for recognizing
patterns that may explain the mechanisms underlying the evolution
of phenotypes, or susceptibility to, and progression of, diseases.
Especially for large datasets, as routinely generated by high through—
put sequencing technologies, the challenge of graphically presenting
the data goes well beyond drawing simple plots, often encompassing
both figures that show how variables change across entire genomes,
as well as graphs that highlight specific sites at a nucleotide or amino
acid resolution. Moreover, a meaningful interpretation often
involves mathematical or statistical algorithms, where, ideally,
analysis and visualization are tightly coupled. Unfortunately, it is
common practice for these to be decoupled, with the ‘heavy—lifting’
computation being done in one language, followed by the
visualization being done with a graphical package like R (http://
CRAN.R—project.org) or MATLAB (http://www.mathworks.com),
or via a scripting language like python (www.python.org).
Although this approach can be effective, it becomes necessary to
reduce size of the analytical data, not because its best for the visual—
ization, but to accommodate the limits inherent in the choice of
graphical package. Here, we describe Whiteboard, a class library
implemented in C++, allowing for easily graphing any kind of data
into any format.

2 Using the whiteboard

Whiteboard provides all basic tool sets for drawing simple objects,
as well as color manipulation methods, an extendable set of com—
pound graphs, and a set of utilities such as a command line parser,
file parsers etc. for data reading and processing. Figure 1 shows four
examples of visualizing different datasets by software that integrate
Whiteboard. For visualizing a summary of protein alignments, we
color—code alignments by taxa first, and use color gradients to indi—
cate local sequence similarity across the query sequence (Fig. 1a).
For genome—wide synteny data computed from the medaka and
zebrafish genomes, we show syntenic regions in zebrafish color
coded by medaka chromosomes (Fig. 1b), where e.g. medaka
chromosome 16 and zebrafish chromosome 16 share synteny over
the entire length, whereas synteny in other chromosomes is broken
up, e.g. zebrafish chromosome 18 (Fig. 1b). For clustering gene
expression, we use color—coding to indicate absolute expression on a
scale from black to yellow (Fig. 1c), which can be computed for all
genes in the dataset (Fig. 1c shows a small subset). We indicate dif—
ferential expression against the mean values in one point in a time
series by color ranging from dark blue (lower) to dark red (higher),
exemplified by HOX genes in eight clusters on the zebrafish genome
(Fig. 1d). An animated image, computed from individual Whiteboard
images, in which we interpolated values between time points, can be
found on Whiteboard’s web site.

The Whiteboard interface is accessed through the ‘whiteboard’
class which is a collection of graphics objects to be drawn, and a dis—
play object on to which the graphics objects are displayed, either
through a 2D or 3D geometry. Graphics objects are defined as
derived classes of the abstract base class ‘graphic’ and provide the
basic definitions of what is to be displayed. A toolkit of basic graph—
ics objects is provided, including ‘line’, ‘rect’, ‘arc’, etc. as well as
compound graphics, such as arrows and boxes. Display objects,
represented by the abstract base class ‘display_type’, are used to
transform the basic definitions provided by the graphic objects into
the format of choice for the graphical output. A derived class,
‘ps_display’, is provided to generate figures in Post—Script
(PS—Adobe—3.0 EPSF—3.0) displays, which are of production quality,
as well as fully editable in graphics processing programs. The code is
designed to be extensible, and other file formats can be accommo—
dated by implementing a class for the desired output format.
Detailed documentation about the interface, together with a set of
example source code files, can be found here: http://whiteboard—
class.sourceforge.net/.

In conclusion, Whiteboard provides a programmatic interface
for visualizing large and complex datasets, which can easily be inte—
grated into programs analyzing biological or medical processes.

Images can be generated in production quality and ready for
publication, interactively, or even as animations. Implemented in
C++, Whiteboard allows for adding extensions supplied by us, and
its wider community of users.

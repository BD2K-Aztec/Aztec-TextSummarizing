Abstract

Motivation: Despite the growing popularity in using CRISPR/CasQ technology for genome editing
and gene knockout, its performance still relies on well—designed single guide RNAs (ngNA). In this
study, we propose a web application for the Design and Optimization (CRISPR—DO) of guide se—
quences that target both coding and non—coding regions in spCasQ CRISPR system across human,
mouse, zebrafish, fly and worm genomes. CRISPR—DO uses a computational sequence model to
predict ngNA efficiency, and employs a specificity scoring function to evaluate the potential of off—
target effect. It also provides information on functional conservation of target sequences, as well as
the overlaps with exons, putative regulatory sequences and single—nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs). The web application has a user—friendly genome—browser interface to facilitate the selec—
tion ofthe best target DNA sequences for experimental design.

Availability and Implementation: CRISPR—DO is available at http://cistrome.org/crispr/

1 Introduction

CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) originally came from bacterial
host defense and has provided new insight into site-specific genome
editing (Hsu et (11., 2014). The CRISPR/Cas9 technology requires an
ngNA with a ~20 hp guide sequence to pair with the target DNA,
which enables the Cas9 protein loading to the correct location and
introduces a DNA double-strand hreak (DSB) (Cho et (11., 2013;
Cong et (11., 2013; Jinek et (11., 2012; Mali et (11., 2013).

To fully utilize the CRISPR genome editing technology, one
must consider two essential factors: off-target effect and cleavage ef-
ficiency of ngNA. On one hand, it has been reported that the mis-
matches in off-target sites, especially those in the 10-12 hases
proximal to the PAM, allow less off-target hinding (Cong et (11.,
2013; Hsu et (11., 2013; Jinek et (11., 2012; Mali et (11., 2013). About
17—19 hp truncated ngNAs are more sensitive to mismatches thus
more specific (Fu et (11., 2014). CRISPR design tools like CRISPR-P
(Lei et (11., 2014), E-CRISPR (Heigwer et (11., 2014) and CasOT

(Xiao et al., 2014) are mainly focused on the prediction of off—target
effect. Cas-OFFinder (Bae et al., 2014) is another off—target detec—
tion tool with multiple CRISPR Systems supported. On the other
hand, for many CRISPR/Cas9 applications, especially for CRISPR
screens, ngNA—induced Cas9 cleavage efficiency is also important.
The ngNA efficiency is predominantly determined by the sequence
of the guide and its 3’ flanking region (Wang et al., 2014; Xu et al.,
2015). Currently, CRISPR design tools such as CRISPR-ERA (Liu
et al., 2015), Benchling (Benchling, RRID:SCR_013955) and
ngNA designer from Broad Institute (Doench et al., 2016) have
consideration for both on— and off—target ngNA design.
Meanwhile, other genomic features of an ngNA target, such as its
evolutional conservation, regulatory potential and genetic vari—
ations, should also be considered in functional analysis using
CRISPR/Cas9 systems (Shi et al., 2015).

To address this need, we propose a web application for the
Design and Optimization (CRISPR—DO) of ngNA sequences in
human, mouse, zebrafish, fly and worm genomes. CRISPR—DO inte—
grates an ngNA efficiency prediction model and an off—target scor—
ing function, which allows the users to evaluate the ‘goodness’ of an
ngNA in both sensitivity and specificity.

In CRISPR—DO, we annotate each target sequence with the
PhastCons conservation score as well as the overlaps with exons,
DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), and single—nucleotide poly—
morphisms (SNPs) for better functional characterization when such
data is available. We also integrated our target sequence search re—
sult with the powerful WashU Epigenome Browser (Zhou et al.,
2011) to enable loading of other genomic tracks and facilitate the
visualization and selection of target sequences. Details of online
CRISPR—DO can be found in Supplementary materials.

2 Methods

2.1 CRISPR target sequence scan in the whole genome
The workflow to generate the target sequence database is shown in
Supplementary Figure S1. We first obtained the full human
(GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38/hg38), mouse (NCBI37/mm9 and
GRCm38/mm10), zebrafish (danRer7), fly (dm6) and worm (ce10)
genome sequences from UCSC genome database. We removed alter—
nate loci, unlocalized and unplaced (random) sequences. Next we
performed a genome—wide ngNA target sequence scan for PAM se—
quences on both the forward and the reverse strand in each genome.
Here, we identified only 5’—NGG—3’ as PAM sequences, since PAM—
like NAG sequences have much lower Cas9 loading efficiency (Hsu
et al., 2013). We used 19 bp or 20 bp target with its PAM and 7 bp
3’ flanking sequence (total 29 bp and 30 bp separately) to build our
primary ngNA target sequence library for further evaluation. The
total number of target sequences in each genome is shown in
Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3.

2.2 Score ngNA efficiency

The nucleotide composition of the 3’ end of the target sequence in—
fluences Cas9 loading (Wang et al., 2014). Recently, we have de—
veloped a model to predict the efficiency of Cas9 cleavage based on
the DNA sequence of an ngNA target and its flanking regions (Xu
et al., 2015). We showed that this model effectively predicts the effi—
ciency of guide RNA in high—throughput CRISPR/Cas9 knockout
screens. The coefficients of each nucleotide in the model can be rep—
resented as a sequence logo (Supplementary Fig. S2). We applied
this model to all target sequences to compute genome—wide

efficiency scores. The overall efficiency score distributions are
shown in Supplementary Figure S3.

2.3 Measure ngNA off—target effect

For each target in our primary database, we first used BWA (Li and
Durbin, 2009) to map it back to the genome, allowing maximum
three mismatches and no gaps. When examining ngNAs with mis—
matched mapping, we removed those not followed by NGG/NAG
on both strands. For the remaining mismatched mappings, we calcu—
lated a specificity score based on Zhang Lab’s formula (Hsu et al.,
2013) (more details in Supplementary materials). The distributions
of the specificity scores in hg38 and mm10 are shown in
Supplementary Figure S4.

2.4 CRISPR target sequence annotation

We annotated each target sequence to characterize its evolutionary
conservation and to exam its overlap (21 bp) with referenced exons,
regulatory elements or SNPs. The average conservation score is cal—
culated using UCSC PhastCons (Supplementary Table S4). The exon
annotation is from UCSC refGene tables. The SNP annotation is
from the NCBI dbSNP database. Peaks from each ENCODE
DNase—seq data were merged to form the union of DNase I hyper—
sensitivity regions, representing a comprehensive repertoire of puta—
tive regulatory elements in the genome (Consortium, 2012). These
annotation features give experimentalists more reference in selecting
ngNAs with the best balance of specificity, efficiency and function.

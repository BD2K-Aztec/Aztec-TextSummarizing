Abstract

Motivation: Discovering and understanding patterns in networks of protein—protein interactions
(PPIs) is a central problem in systems biology. Alignments between these networks aid functional
understanding as they uncover important information, such as evolutionary conserved pathways,
protein complexes and functional orthologs. A few methods have been proposed for global PPI
network alignments, but because of NP—completeness of underlying sub—graph isomorphism
problem, producing topologically and biologically accurate alignments remains a challenge.
Results: We introduce a novel global network alignment tool, Lagrangian GRAphlet—based ALigner
(L—GRAAL), which directly optimizes both the protein and the interaction functional conservations,
using a novel alignment search heuristic based on integer programming and Lagrangian relax—
ation. We compare L—GRAAL with the state—of—the—art network aligners on the largest available
PPI networks from BioGRlD and observe that L—GRAAL uncovers the largest common sub—graphs
between the networks, as measured by edge—correctness and symmetric sub—structures scores,
which allow transferring more functional information across networks. We assess the biological
quality of the protein mappings using the semantic similarity of their Gene Ontology annotations
and observe that L—GRAAL best uncovers functionally conserved proteins. Furthermore, we intro—
duce for the first time a measure of the semantic similarity of the mapped interactions and show
that L—GRAAL also uncovers best functionally conserved interactions. In addition, we illustrate
on the PPI networks of baker’s yeast and human the ability of L—GRAAL to predict new PPls. Finally,
L—GRAAL’s results are the first to show that topological information is more important than
sequence information for uncovering functionally conserved interactions.

1 Introduction

 

Understanding the patterns in molecular interactions is of fore—
most importance in systems biology, as it is instrumental to under—
standing the functioning of the cell (Ryan et (11., 2013). Because
molecular interactions are often modeled by networks, a large num—
ber of studies focused on understanding the topology of these
networks (Nepusz and Paccanaro, 2014; Przulj, 2011). In the case

of protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks, where nodes repre—
sent proteins and edges connect proteins that interact, comparative
studies based on network alignments were particularly successful.
Given two networks, aligning them means finding a node—to—node
mapping (also called an alignment) between the networks that
optimizes two objectives: (i) maximizing the number of mapped
proteins (nodes) that are evolutionarily or functionally related

and (ii) maximizing the number of common interactions (edges) be—
tween the networks. Network alignment uncovers valuable informa—
tion, such as evolutionarily conserved pathways and protein
complexes (Kelley et al., 2003; Kuchaiev et al., 2010) or functional
orthologs (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2006). Finding these allows trans—
fer of information across species, such as performing Herpes
viral experiments in yeast or ﬂy and then applying the insights
toward understanding the mechanisms of human diseases (Uetz
et al., 2006).

Network alignment problem is computationally intractable
due to NP—completeness of the underlying sub—graph isomorphism
problem (Cook, 1971). Hence, several network alignment heuristics
(i.e. approximate aligners) have been proposed. Earlier methods,
called local network aligners, search for small but highly conserved
sub—networks called motifs (Flannick et al., 2006; Kelley et al.,
2004; Koyuturk et al., 2006). As motifs can be duplicated, local
network aligners often produce one—to—many or many—to—many map—
pings, in which a node from a given network can be mapped to sev—
eral nodes of the other network. Although these multiple mappings
can indicate gene duplications, they are often biologically implaus—
ible (Singh et al., 2007). Hence, global network aligners, which per—
form an overall comparison of the input networks and produce
one—to—one mappings between the nodes of the two networks have
been introduced. Several heuristics have been proposed for solving
the global alignment problem.

The first one is ISORANK (Singh et al., 2007), which rephrases
aligning networks as an eigenvalue problem, mimicking Google’s
Pagerank algorithm. HOPEMAP (Tian and Samatova, 2009) itera—
tively constructs the alignment between two networks by searching
for a common maximally connected component. PATH and GA
algorithms (Zaslavskiy et al., 2009) optimize the same objective
function, which balances between mapping similar proteins and
increasing the number of mapped interactions. The GRAAL family
(Kuchaiev and Przulj, 2011; Kuchaiev et al., 2010; Memisevic and
Przulj, 2012; Milenkovi’c et al., 2010) is a set of network aligners,
which are based on the idea that mapping together nodes that are
involved in similar local wiring patterns (as measured by the statis—
tics of small induced sub—graph called graphlets) will result in a
large number of shared interactions. As newer GRAAL aligners
use improved alignment heuristic strategies, using C—GRAAL or
MI—GRAAL is recommended. Also, these two methods allow using
additional node scores, such as sequence similarity. NATALIE
(El—Kebir et al., 201 1) is a combinatorial optimization method based
on Lagrangian relaxation, which searches for top scoring network
alignments over the biologically plausible node mappings obtained
by sequence alignment. GHOST (Patro and Kingsford, 2012) is a
spectral approach, where nodes are mapped according to the simi—
larity of their spectral signatures. NETAL (Neyshabur et al., 2013)
is a fast greedy heuristic that constructs an alignment by iteratively
inserting the node mapping with the highest probability to induce
common edges, where the probabilities are recomputed at each iter—
ation. SPINAL (Aladag and Erten, 2013) is a two—step approach,
which first computes coarse—grained node similarity scores, and then
based on these scores, iteratively grows a seed solution. PISWAP
(Chindelevitch et al., 2013) optimizes global alignments using a
derivative of the local 3—0pt heuristic, which is originally used
for solving the traveling salesman problem. MAGNA (Saraph and
Milenkovic, 2014) uses a genetic algorithm to maximize the
edge conservation between the aligned networks. HUBALIGN
(Hashemifar and Xu, 2014) uses a minimum—degree heuristic to
align ‘important’ proteins first and then gradually extends the align—
ment to the whole networks. Although all the above methods align

networks to derive additional biological knowledge (e.g. orthology
group and functional annotations), DUALALIGNER (Seah et al.,
2014) does the opposite and uses biological knowledge to produce
network alignments.

The number of known molecular interactions has increased tre—
mendously during the last decade due to the technological advances
in high—throughput interaction detection techniques such as yeast
two—hybrid (Fields and Song, 1989) and affinity purification
coupled to mass spectrometry (H0 et al., 2002). Because of the
increasing amount of available interaction data, coupled with the
computational hardness of the network alignment problem, produc—
ing topologically and biologically accurate alignments is still
challenging.

In this article, we introduce a novel global network alignment
tool that we call Lagrangian GRAphlet—based ALigner (L—GRAAL).
Unlike previous aligners, which either do not take into account the
mapped interactions (e.g. the previous GRAAL aligners and
ISORANK) or use naive interaction mapping scoring schemes (e.g.
NATALIE), L—GRAAL optimizes a novel objective function that
takes into account both sequence—based protein conservation and
graphlet—based interaction conservation, by using a novel alignment
search heuristic based on integer programming and Lagrangian re—
laxation. We compare L—GRAAL with the state—of—the—art network
aligners on the largest available PPI networks from BioGRID and
observe that L—GRAAL uncovers the largest overlaps between the
networks, as measured with edge—correctness (EC) and symmetric
sub—structure scores. These largest overlaps are key for transferring
annotations between networks. Using semantic similarity, we ob—
serve that L—GRAAL’s protein mappings and interaction mappings
are in better agreement with Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al.,
2000) than any other network aligners. By aligning the PPI networks
of baker’s yeast and human, we additionally show that the results of
L—GRAAL can be used to predict new PPIs. Finally, using our novel
semantic similarity measure of the interaction mappings and the
ability of L—GRAAL to produce alignments by using both topo—
logical and sequence similarity, we observe for the first time that
topological similarity plays a more important role than sequence
similarity in uncovering functionally conserved interactions, a result
that escaped all previous approaches.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Definitions and notations

2.1.1 PPI network

The PPIs of a given organism are represented by a PPI network,
N : (V, E), where nodes in V represent proteins and two nodes 14
and v are connected by an edge (u, v) in E if the corresponding
proteins are known to interact.

2.1.2 Global network alignment

Given two PPI networks, N1 : (V1,E1) and N2 : (V2,E2),
for which (V1lSlV2l, a global alignment,  V1 —> V2, is a 1—t0—1
mapping of the nodes in V1 to the nodes in V2. Formally, global
alignment is assigned a real—valued score S:

S(f)=Zn(Mtf(M))+ Z 8(M7f(u)7v7f(v))7 (1)

146 V1 (“J/)EEl

where n : V1 >< V2 —> R+ is the score of mapping a node of V1 to a
node in V2, and e : E1 >< E2 —> [R+ is the score of mapping an edge
of E1 to an edge of E2. The Global Network Alignment problem
aims to find a global alignment that maximizes S.

2.1.3 Graphlets and orbits

Graphlets are small, connected, non—isomorphic, induced sub—
graphs of a larger graph (denoted by Go, . .. ,G29 in Fig. 1) (Przulj
et al., 2004). Within each graphlet, some nodes are topologically
identical with others: such identical nodes are said to belong to the
same automorphism orbit (denoted by 0,  ,72 in Fig. 1) (Przulj,
2007). Graphlets generalize the notion of node degree: the graphlet
degree of node v, denoted by dj, is the number of times node 11
touches a graphlet at orbit i (Priulj, 2007). Graphlet degrees are
successfully used for measuring the distance between two networks
(Priulj, 2007), as well as measuring the topological similarities
among nodes in networks (Milenkovic and Przulj, 2008), which are
further applied for guiding the network alignment process in the
GRAAL family of network aligners, and for comparing protein
structures (Malod—Dognin and Przulj, 2014).

2.2 L—GRAAL method

2.2.1 Similarity scores and objective function

In L—GRAAL, we measure the evolutionary relationship between
two mapped proteins a and f(n) according to their BLAST sequence
alignment:

, seqsim<u.f<u>>
_ max iﬁiseqsim(i, /) 7

n(Mtl‘(M))

where seqsim can be any sequence—based similarity score (in this
article, we use both log of BLAST’s e—values and BLAST’s bit—
scores).

We measure the topological similarity between two mapped pro—
teins u and f(n) using their 2— to 4—node graphlet degree similarity t:

1 14 min<d;.d;(,)>

t(u.f(M)) : E 1:0 

We measure the topological similarity between two mapped
interactions (edges), (14, v) and  f(v)), according to the graphlet
degree similarity of their mapped end nodes:

(t(utf(u)) + t(141%)»-

NIH

8(M7f(u)7v7f(v)) =

This score is in [0, 1] and it rewards mapping edges that are involved
in similar local wiring patterns. Note that we also use all 2— to
5—node graphlet degrees, but it only resulted in larger running times,
without improving the quality of the alignments.

L—GRAAL’s objective function, S, either favors the evolutionary
relationships between the mapped proteins or the topological simi—
larity between the mapped interactions, according to a balancing

2.2.2 Two-step alignment search strategy

Because of the large sizes of PPI networks, solving the network
alignment problem when considering all possible node mappings is
computationally intractable.

In a first step, we use sequence and graphlet degree similarities
to select a subset of the node mappings on which L—GRAAL will op—
timize seed alignments; namely, we only consider the node mappings
n <—> 11, such that an(n,v) + (1 — a)t(n,v)20.5. We term the map—
ping that satisfy this criteria selected node mappings. In a second
step, a greedy heuristic extends the seed alignments using all possible
node mappings, i.e. without being restricted to selected node map—
pings anymore.

Because both L—GRAAL’s and NATALIE’s alignment search
algorithms are based on integer programming and Lagrangian relax—
ation, Supplementary Section 1.4 presents the differences between
the two approaches.

2.2.3 Generating seed alignments using integer programming
First, to each selected node mapping, i <—> k, i 6 V1 , k 6 V2, we asso—
ciate a binary variable xik, such that xik: 1 if the node
mapping is in the alignment and 0 otherwise. Similarly, we associ—
ate to each edge mapping between selected node mappings,
(i,/') <—> (k,l), (i,/') E E1, (k, l) E E2, a binary variable 31,712,, such that
31,7ka 1 if the edge mapping is in the alignment and 0 otherwise.
For brevity, henceforth, we ensure that each edge mapping is only
considered once by enforcing k <l. This allows us to differentiate
the two end—node mappings that result from an edge mapping
(i,/') <—> (k,l): we term i <—> k a tail-node mapping and / <—> l a head-
node mapping.

The network alignment problem can now be expressed with the
following integer program (IP):

IP : rggyx («2 no; k) x xii + (1 — «)2 ecu/312.1) x m). (3)

subject to:

x11: - 3571:1207 Will) 6 E17V(ktl)6 E27 (7)

where constraints (4, 5) enforce that a node from V1 is mapped
to at most one node from V2 and vice versa and constraints (6, 7)
enforce that the selected edge mappings (i, /) <—> (k, I) must have their
end—nodes mapped as: i <—> k and/ <—> l.

Because of the 1—to—1 mapping constraints (4,5), the relations
between the edge mappings and their head—node mappings can be
rewritten in a compact form. Given a node mapping /' <—> l and any
node i 6 N1, such that edge (i,/') E E1, then at most one edge map—
ping (i,/') <—> (k,l) can be selected by choosing a node mapping
i<—> k. Constraint (6) can then be replaced by the following two

In IP, when all the constraints between the node mappings and the
edge mappings are considered, the head—node mappings also respect
the 1—to—1 matching constraints. To keep this property in our
relaxed model, we add the following constraints into LR(2):

2.2.4 Lagrangian relaxation

To solve IP, we apply Lagrangian relaxation (Held and Karp, 1970),
by relaxing constraints (8, 9), i.e. disconnecting the edge mappings
from their head nodes. Relaxed constraints are added as penalties
into the objective function, associated with Lagrangian multipliers
(2?1 for each constraint 8 and 2:1: for each constraint 9). Because
relaxed constraints are inequalities, the Lagrangian multipliers
must be non—negative real numbers (i.e. 2 E RT’O). This gives us the
relaxed problem (LR(2)):

LR(2) :  n4“(i,k) >< xii + 2820-70871) >< yijkl (12)

subject to (4, 5, 7 and 10, 11), where e4(i,/',k,l) : (1 — a) X e(i,/',
12,1) — 2', — 1;]: and n4(i,k) : a X n(i,k) + 2,173: + 2,13; are the
new node and edge scores after adding the penalties from the
relaxed constraints.

We developed a double bipartite matching algorithm, detailed
in the Supplementary Material, Section 1.1, for solving LR(2) in
O()Vl3 + (Vlzd3) time, where (V) is the number of nodes in the net—
works and d is the largest degree of a node. Solving LR(2) generates
a relaxed solution  This relaxed solution is an upper bound
on IP, as its score is greater than or equal to the one of IP, but it is
often infeasible, as chosen edge mappings (the components of 3; that
are set to 1) may not coincide with chosen node mappings (the com—
ponents of 35 that are set to 1). However, any relaxed solution (35, 
can be repaired iEto a feasible solution (35, y’) of IP by selecting the
edge mappings y’ corresponding to the selected node mappings.
Such feasible solution is a lower bound on IP, as its score is smaller
than or equal to the one of IP.

To solve IP, we solve its Lagrangian dual problem, which is a
minimization of LR(2) over 2. Many methods have been proposed
so far for solving Lagrangian dual problem (Guignard, 2003).
Here, we choose the sub—gradient descent method (Held et al., 1974)
because of our large number of relaxed constraints. The sub—
gradient descent is an iterative method that generates a sequence
of Lagrangian multipliers 2(0), 2(1), 2(2), . . . , starting from
2(0) : 0, where 2(i + 1) aims to fix the broken relaxed constraints
in the solution of LR(2(i)), by making a step along its sub—gradient
vector. Details on our implementation are given in the
Supplementary Material, Section 1.2. Unfortunately, the Lagrangian
dual problem is also NP—complete, and thus one could not expect
to solve it in a reasonable time.

In practice, the process of solving the Lagrangian dual is
used _for generating a sequence of seed solutions (350, y’o),
(3510/1), . . . , until a given time limit or an iteration number limit is
reached (we use 1 h and 1000 iterations as default).

2.2.5 Heuristically extending seed alignments

At e3ch iteration of the sub—gradient descent, the seed alignment
(350/) is extended to include all node mappings with a three—step
greedy heuristic (see Algorithm 1 in Supplementary Material,
Section 1.3). All node mappings that do not positively contribute to
the score of the alignment are removed. The alignment is then max—
imally extended by sequentially visiting the yet unaligned nodes in
V1 and mapping them to the yet unaligned nodes in V2, so that the
score of the alignment is maximized. Then, a greedy local search
sequentially visits V1 and tries inserting or exchanging node map—
ping i<—> k to improve the score of the alignment. Note that the
extended alignments are not returned to the dual solver, since they
are not computed on the same search space (seed alignments are re—
stricted to selected node mappings, whereas the extended alignments
are not), so they would invalidate the sub—gradient descent scheme
if included. When these computations end, L—GRAAL returns the
extended alignment with the best score.

2.3 Datasets

From the manually curated BioGRID database (v3.2.101, June
2013) (Chatr—Aryamontri et al., 2013), we obtained PPI networks
of eight organisms that have the largest number of known phys—
ical interactions: Homo sapiens (HS, 13276 nodes and 110528
edges), Saccloaromyces cerevisiae (SC, 5831 nodes and 77 149
edges), Drosoploila melanogaster (DM, 7937 nodes and
34 753 edges), Arabidopsis thaliana (AT, 5897 nodes and 13 381
edges), Mus mnscnlns (MM, 4370 nodes and 9116 edges),
Caenorloabditis elegans (CE, 3134 nodes and 5428 edges),
Schizosaccloaromyces pombe (SP, 1911 nodes and 4711 edges) and
Rattns norvegicns (RN, 1657 nodes and 2330 edges). Note that
physical interactions in BioGRID include both direct (e.g. from
yeast—two—hybrid) and indirect (e.g. from affinity capture) inter—
actions, so edges in our PPI networks connect proteins that either
directly interact or that co—exist in stable complexes. We retrieved
the corresponding protein sequences and GO annotations from
NCBI’s Entrez Gene database (Maglott et al., 2005). Note that we
only retrieved experimentally validated GO annotations, from
which we further removed the annotations inferred from PPIs (code
IPI). L—GRAAL is one of the few methods that can align even the
largest of the networks presented above. As already reported by
Clark and Kalita (2014), many of the other aligners have memory
issues when handling the two largest networks of yeast and human.
Thus, the comparisons presented in sections 3.1 and 3.2 are based
on the  : 15 pairs of networks that involve DM, AT, MM, CE,
SP and RN, which can be solved by all methods. L—GRAAL’s align—
ments of yeast and human PPI networks are presented in Section
3.3. In the Supplementary Material, we also assess the robustness
of our results by comparing the performance of network aligners
on two more datasets. First, we create the binary PPI networks by
restricting our BioGRID networks to the yeast—two—hybrid captured
interactions only. Second, we use the synthetic random networks
from the NAPA benchmark (Sahraeian and Yoon, 2012).

2.4 Evaluation

We compare the alignments of L—GRAAL to those of HUBALIGN,
MAGNA, PISWAP, SPINAL, NETAL, GHOST, NATALIE, MI—
GRAAL and ISORANK. We set MI—GRAAL to use graphlet degree
vector similarity (GDS) alone, as well as to use GDS coupled with
sequence similarity (GDS+SEQ); since it is a randomized algorithm,
we repeat each alignment process 15 times for GDS and 15 times
for GDS+SEQ, to find alignments of the best topological and

biological quality. We set SPINAL to use mode II, as recommended
in the corresponding paper. For all aligners that can produce
alignments using pure topology or pure sequence information
by balancing parameters varying in [0,1] (e.g. parameter a for
L—GRAAL), we sample the balancing parameters from 0 to 1 in
increments of 0.1. We set the time limits of both L—GRAAL and
NATALIE to 1 h per alignment. We set MAGNA to optimize S3
score, on a population size of 2000, over 15 000 generations, setting
that is recommended in the corresponding paper. For all network
aligners, we leave other parameters at their default values. All com—
putations are done on a desktop computer with an Intel Core
I7—2600 CPU at 3.40GHz with 64 GB of memory. For all these
aligners, we report the results of their best alignments, according to
the following measures.

2.4.1 Topological quality

Network aligners are first compared by their ability to map proteins
that are similarly connected in both PPI networks. First, the size of
the alignment is measured by EC, which is the percentage of inter—
actions from the smaller network that are mapped to interactions
from the other network (Kuchaiev et al., 2010). Because large EC
can be achieved by mapping sparse regions of the smaller network
to densely connected regions of the larger one, we also measure how
topologically similar are the mapped regions using the symmetric
sub-structure score (S3), which is the percentage of the conserved
edges between the smaller network and the sub—network from the
larger network that is induced by the alignment (Saraph and
Milenkovic, 2014). Finally, we use the size of the largest connected
component (LCC) to ensure that the alignments correspond to large
common connected sub—structure, instead of several small discon—
nected ones (Kuchaiev et al., 2010).

2.4.2 Biological quality

It is not known which proteins from one PPI network should be
mapped to which ones in the other PPI network. Biological similar—
ity of two mapped proteins can be measured by the semantic similar—
ity of their GO term annotations. We compute the semantic
similarity using Resnik semantic similarity (Resnik, 1995) with best—
match average mixing strategy. Then, we measure the biological
quality of the entire alignment by the sum of the semantic similar—
ities of the mapped proteins, divided by the smaller number of anno—
tated proteins in the two networks.

3 Results and discussion

Here, we present the results achieved by network aligners on the
real PPI networks from BioGRID.

3.1 Topological analysis

First, L—GRAAL, HUBALIGN and GHOST produce the largest
alignments, with EC of 52.2% for L—GRAAL, 52.1% for
HUBALIGN and 42.7% for GHOST (see the left panel of Fig. 2).
These large alignments are key, as they allow transferring more
information across networks. We also measure the statistical signifi—
cance of the obtained EC scores using the standard model of sam—
pling without replacement, as proposed by Kuchaiev et al. (2010)
(the formula is presented in the Supplementary Material). All are
statistically significant, as the probability of obtaining similar or
higher values by chance is always smaller than 0.05. We test
whether L—GRAAL achieves larger EC by mapping the smaller net—
work to the densest regions of the larger network (the dense regions
corresponding to, e.g. large complexes captured by affinity capture—
based methods). This is not the case, since L—GRAAL, NETAL
and MAGNA best map sparse regions with sparse regions and
dense regions with dense regions, with symmetric sub—structures
score:31.1% for L—GRAAL, 29.3% for NETAL and 26.4% for
MAGNA (see the middle panel of Fig. 2). In other word, L—GRAAL
is less biased toward cliquish structures than other aligners. On the
opposite, while HUBALIGN achieves EC that is comparable to the
one of L—GRAAL, it achieves smaller S3 score. This is not surprising
as HUBALIGN favors mapping densely connected proteins. Finally,
HUBALIGN, L—GRAAL and MI—GRAAL produce the least frag—
mented network alignments, with LCC:74.6% for HUBALIGN,
71.5% for L—GRAAL and 67.7% for MI—GRAAL (see the right
panel of Fig. 2).

Overall, L—GRAAL and HUBALIGN outperform all other align—
ers in terms of the topological quality of their alignments on the real
networks from BioGRID (we also observe similar results when
aligning binary PPIs only, see Supplementary Fig. S4). However,
although L—GRAAL also achieves good performances when aligning
the synthetic networks from the NAPA benchmark, HUBALIGN
does not, which shows the higher robustness of L—GRAAL (see
Supplementary Fig. S5).

3.2 Biological analysis
As presented in the left panel of Figure 3, L—GRAAL, HUBALIGN
and GHOST map proteins that are involved in similar GO biolo—
gical processes (GO—BPs) best, with average semantic similarity of
the protein mappings of 1.09 for L—GRAAL, 1.08 for HUBALIGN
and 1.04 for GHOST. Similar holds for GO molecular functions
(GO—MFs) and GO cellular component annotations (GO—CC), as
presented in the middle and right panels of Fig. 3).

Large semantic similarities of the protein mappings indicate
that the alignments map functionally conserved proteins, but it does

(white nodes and gray edges) is mapped to the PPI sub-network of human (red nodes and orange edges) as indicated by the blue edges. The inset highlights a
predicted interaction: Proteins MRPSS and MRP17, which are interacting in the yeast PPI network, are aligned to proteins MRPSS and MRPSG, which are not inter-
acting in the human PPI network. Right: Using the whole L-GRAAL's alignment between yeast and human PPI networks, we plot in black the number of predicted
interactions (y axis) as a function of the minimum sequence identity between the aligned yeast-human proteins (X axis). We add in red the number of these pre-

not mean that these functions are performed through conserved
interaction patterns between the two PPI networks. Although func—
tionally conserved interactions may highlight fundamental mechan—
isms (e.g. key binary interactions or complexes that must be
conserved), network aligners are never compared in this respect.
To measure the functional conservation of the mapped interactions,
we define the semantic similarity of two mapped interactions as the
average of the semantic similarities of the corresponding pairs
of mapped proteins. Then, we measure the biological quality of
the whole interaction mapping as the sum of all the interaction
semantic similarities divided by the smaller number of interactions
between annotated proteins in the two networks. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time that the biological quality of the
interaction mapping is considered.

As presented in Supplementary Figure S1, HUBALIGN,
L—GRAAL and SPINAL are the best in mapping interactions that
are involved in similar BPs, in similar MFs, and that are localized
in similar cellular regions. Overall, L—GRAAL and HUBALIGN
outperform all other aligners in terms of the biological quality
of their alignments when aligning real networks from BioGRID
(we also observe similar results when aligning binary PPIs only,
see Supplementary Fig. S4) and again L—GRAAL shows higher
robustness than HUBALIGN when aligning synthetic networks
from the NAPA benchmark (see Supplementary Fig. S5).

3.3 Predicting protein interactions
Although a good network alignment should map together function—
ally related proteins that interact in similar ways, alignments are

also composed of edge-mismatches, where interacting proteins are
mapped to non—interacting proteins.

To illustrate this phenomenon, we first investigate the largest
shared pathway between Saccloaromyces cerevisiae and Homo sapi—
ens PPI networks that is found in L—GRAAL’s alignment, which is the
ribosome pathway (KEGG Id 3010) that contains 105 proteins and
862 interactions.

This alignment, illustrated in the left panel of Figure 4, correctly
aligns the dense sub—network from yeast to the dense sub—network of
human. However, it also aligns interacting proteins to non—interact—
ing ones. For example, it aligns yeast’s MRPS5 and MRP17, which
interact according to BioGRID’s data, with human’s MRPS5 and
MRPS6, which are not reported to interact in BioGRID (see the inset
of Fig. 4). Further investigation shows that these two protein map—
pings are biologically relevant. First, the proteins are evolutionarily
related: human’s and yeast’s MRPS5 share 33.6% of sequence
identity, and human’s MRPS6 and yeast’s MRP17 share 29.3% of
sequence identity. Second, human’s MRPS5 and MRPS6 are known
to interact, as captured by anti tag coimmunoprecipitation assay
(Richter et al., 2010). Therefore, L—GRAAL’s alignment of yeast
edge (MRPS5, MRP17) predicted the missing interaction in human
data from BioGRID.

Building upon this insight, we measure how many potential
interactions can be predicted by L—GRAAL’s alignment, by counting
the number of edge—mismatches whose node mappings involve
proteins with high sequence identity. In this way, we show that
L—GRAAL’s alignment can predict 200 potential interactions for
which the sequence identity between the mapped proteins is 270%,

threshold for which the mapped proteins are expected to share the
same functions (Rost, 2002), see the right panel of Figure 4.
Supplementary Figure S3 presents the number of predictions
that are obtained when using less stringent sequence identity thresh—
olds (the list of all predicted interactions is available in the
Supplementary Excel Table).

We find that 34% of these predicted interactions are also pre—
dicted in the Interologous Interaction Database (I2D ver. 2.3)
(Brown and Jurisica, 2007), which is statistically significant since
the probability to obtain better or equal overlaps by chance is less
than 10‘99 (using sampling without replacement, as detailed in the
Supplementary Material, Section 1.5). This result suggests that net—
work aligners such as L—GRAAL can be used as alternative protein
interaction predictors.

3.4 Balancing sequence and topological information
L—GRAAL can produce alignments from topology and sequence in—
formation when the balancing parameter, u, varies from 0 to 1.
In the previous experiments, we report the best scores (EC, S3,
semantic similarities of protein and interaction mappings) that are
obtained when u varies from 0 to 1 using a step size of 0.1. Here, we
report the effect of u on each of these scores. The corresponding
plots are presented in Supplementary Figure S2.

First, all topological scores reach their maximum values when
using topological information only (a : 0), with EC 251.5%,
S3 230.9% and LCC:68.1% on average. It is also important to
notice that using sequence information only (at : 1) results in align—
ment having almost no common interactions (EC 22.0%, on aver—
age). Second, the semantic similarities of the aligned proteins either
reach their maximum when using both topological and sequence
information or when using sequence similarity only, at z 0.9 for BP
and cellular component and u: 1 for MF. In contrast, the semantic
similarities of the aligned interactions reach their maximum when
using topological information only (at : 0).

These results show again the complementarity of the two sources
of information. Also, the comparison between the interactions’ se—
mantic similarities that are obtained when using topological infor—
mation only with the ones that are obtained when using sequence
information only suggests that topology plays a more important role
than sequence for uncovering functionally conserved interactions.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this is
observed. The importance of topology may be due to the concept
of function itself, which implies interactions with some part of the
cell or the environment (Hartwell et al., 1999) and these interactions
are captured by the topology of the PPI networks. Also, sequence
similarity may fail at identifying the correct one—to—one relationships
between genes when their homology relationships are not straight—
forward. Such difficult cases where topology is required include
finding the relationships between a set of paralogous genes in a
given species and its set of co—ortholog genes in another species.

4 Concluding remarks

First, we propose a global network alignment method called
L—GRAAL, which combines a novel objective function where the
topological similarity of the mapped interaction is based on graphlet
degree, with an efficient network alignment search algorithm
based on integer programming and Lagrangian relaxation. Using the
largest PPI networks from BioGRID, we show that L—GRAAL’s
alignments outperform other network alignments: they uncover
the largest common sub—networks between aligned networks, as
measured by EC and symmetric sub—structure scores.

Second, as measured by the average semantic similarity of the
mapped proteins, we observe that L—GRAAL best uncovers function—
ally conserved proteins. Because the objective of network aligners
is not only to uncover functionally conserved proteins but also func—
tionally conserved interactions among these proteins, we propose
a novel way of measuring the semantic similarity of the mapped
interactions and observe that L—GRAAL is among the best aligners
for uncovering functionally conserved interactions.

Third, on a case study of aligning human and yeast PPI net—
works, we show that L—GRAAL can be used to predict new inter—
actions. Designing a whole benchmarking and validation strategy
needed for finding which network aligners best predict protein inter—
actions and for precisely comparing such predictions with the ones
of traditional predictors are out of scope of this study.

Fourth, using the ability of L—GRAAL to produce alignments
using topological and sequence similarity, we observe that topo—
logical similarity plays a more important role than sequence simi—
larity for uncovering functionally conserved interactions. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first time that this has been
observed.

Finally, L—GRAAL’s computations can be easily speed up by
using parallel programming. In each iteration of the Lagrangian
dual solver, i.e. when solving LR(2) for a given 2, each local bipart—
ite matching for finding the best set of outgoing edges from a given
node is an independent task. In addition, each bipartite matching
problem, local and global, can be solved with parallel versions of
the successive shortest paths algorithm (Storuy and Sorevik, 1997).
This high level of parallelism for speeding up L—GRAAL’s computa—
tions is very promising as it allows it to scale with the future growth
of the interaction data.

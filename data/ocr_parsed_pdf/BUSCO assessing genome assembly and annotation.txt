Abstract

Motivation: Genomics has revolutionized biological research, but quality assessment of the resulting
assembled sequences is complicated and remains mostly limited to technical measures like N50.

Results: We propose a measure for quantitative assessment of genome assembly and annotation
completeness based on evolutionarily informed expectations of gene content. We implemented
the assessment procedure in open—source software, with sets of Benchmarking Universal Single—

Copy Orthologs, named BUSCO.

Availability and implementation: Software implemented in Python and datasets available for

1 Introduction

Genomics data acquisition continues to accelerate, however, the
short lengths of sequencing reads make their assembly into full—
length chromosomes extremely challenging. To gauge potential limi—
tations and implement improvements it is thus important to assess
the quality of the resulting data. Proposed measures (Clark et (11.,
2013; Gurevich et (11., 2013; Hunt at 111., 2013; Simpson, 2014) re—
ﬂect methodologies, e.g. per—base error rates, insert size distribu—
tions; or genome biases, e.g. k—mer distributions; or fragment
(contig) length distributions, e.g. N50, which summarizes assembly
contiguity in a single number: half the genome is assembled on con—
tigs of length N50 or longer. However, such measures do not assess
assembly completeness in terms of gene content: an important con—
sideration that also affects data interpretation and helps to guide im—
proved assembly and annotation strategies.

With the growing number of available sequenced genomes,
knowledge of their gene content is consolidating and can be used to

develop an evolutionary measure of genome completeness. Here, we
revisit the idea of using known genes to measure genome assembly
and annotation completeness (Mende et (11., 2013; Parra et (11.,
2009), by introducing a citable notation for well—defined measures,
compiling the comprehensive datasets to support such assessments,
and offering these as an off—the—shelf software.

As proposed previously (Waterhouse et (11., 2013),
Benchmarking Universal Single—Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) are ideal
for such quantifications of completeness, as the expectations for
these genes to be found in a genome and to be found only in single—
copy are evolutionarily sound. We used our OrthoDB database of
orthologs (www.0rthodb.org) to define BUSCO sets for six major
phylogenetic clades. Sampling hundreds of genomes, orthologous
groups with single—copy orthologs in >90% of species were selected.
Importantly, this threshold accommodates the fact that even well—
conserved genes can be lost in some lineages, as well as allowing for
incomplete gene annotations and rare gene duplications. Subsequent

Assessing genome assembly and annotation completeness

filtering, e.g. on sequence uniqueness and conservation levels [see
Supplementary Online Material (SOM) for details], resulted in
BUSCO sets representing 3023 genes for vertebrates, 2675 for
arthropods, 843 for metazoans, 1438 for fungi and 429 for eukary—
otes. We also adopted 40 universal marker genes proposed for the
assessment of prokaryotic genomes (Mende et (11., 2013). The clades
spanning many phyla offer comprehensive coverage of the tree of
life, while the more narrowly defined clades provide a much greater
resolution with much larger BUSCO sets. These are applicable not
only to the assessment of genome assemblies, but also to annotated
gene sets, as well as assembled transcriptomes (Fig. 1). Additionally,
as near—universal single—copy markers, the recovered genes are ideal
for species phylogeny reconstructions.

We propose intuitive metrics to describe genome, gene set or
transcriptome completeness in BUSCO notation — Czcomplete
[D:duplicated], F:fragmented, M:missing, nznumber of genes used
(Fig. 1). The recovered genes are classified as ‘complete’ when their
lengths are within two standard deviations of the BUSCO group
mean length (i.e. within ~95 % expectation, Supplementary Fig. S1).
‘Complete’ genes found with more than one copy are classified as
‘duplicated’. These should be rare, as BUSCOs are evolving under
single—copy control (Waterhouse et (11., 2011), and the recovery of
many duplicates may therefore indicate erroneous assembly of
haplotypes. Genes only partially recovered are classified as ‘frag—
mented’, and genes not recovered are classified as ‘missing’. Finally,
the ‘number of genes used’ indicates the resolution and hence is in—
formative of the confidence of these assessments.

Using HMMER 3 (Eddy, 2011) hidden Markov model (HMM)
profiles from amino acid alignments, the core of the analysis work—
ﬂow (Fig. 1) assesses whether BUSCO gene matches are orthologous
or not (i.e. satisfy BUSCO group—specific bitscore cut—offs; detailed
in SOM), and classifies positive matches as complete or fragmented.
This core analysis is the same for assessing genomes, transcriptomes
or gene sets. However, additional analyses are required to first anno—
tate genes from transcriptomes and genomes. The simple longest
open reading frame approach performs well for transcriptomes. For
genomes, gene annotation is performed with Augustus (Keller et (11.,
2011), guided by amino acid BUSCO group block—profiles, on gen—
omic loci detected with tBLASTn searches using BUSCO group con—
sensus sequences (detailed in SOM). Although this gene prediction
approach may have its limitations and biases, they are consistent
across different species, making for fair comparisons. Conveniently,
the thousands of confident BUSCO gene models provide an excellent
gene predictor training set for use as part of genome annotation
pipelines.

Table 1 reports BUSCO notation assessments of five diverse spe—
cies for both their genome assemblies and their annotated gene sets.
Assessing 70 genomes, 163 gene sets, and 96 transcriptomes re—
vealed substantial variability of completeness (Supplementary Table

highlights how completeness provides important complementary

information for quality assessment. Nevertheless, the fact that some
genome assemblies appear less complete than their corresponding
gene sets (e.g. H. sapiens Table 1) reveals limitations of the BUSCO
gene prediction step. On the other hand, a reversal of this trend (e.g.
A. nidulans Table 1) suggests that the annotated gene set may be
missing some BUSCO gene matches that are in fact present in the
genome. Thus, it should be noted that while BUSCO assessments
aim to robustly estimate completeness of the datasets, technical limi—
tations (particularly gene prediction) may inﬂate proportions of
‘fragmented’ and ‘missing’ BUSCOs, especially for large genomes.
More ‘missing’ BUSCOs may also be reported for species that are
highly derived with respect to the assessment clade—even with high—
quality genomes (e.g. C. elegans Table 1)—reﬂecting the organism’s
evolutionary history rather than an incomplete assembly.
Comparing genome to gene set completeness of 40 species using
a 25 0—BUSCO eukaryotic subset reveals generally consistent assess—
ments across highly divergent lineages from fungi to human (Fig. 2).

comparison (i.e. implementing gene set assessments using CEGMA
HMMs, see SOM for details) appears somewhat less consistent (Fig.
2, BUSCO linear regression is closer to the diagonal). Additionally,
in comparable 250—BUSCO and 248—CEGMA assessments BUSCO
run—times are substantially faster, ~2x for small genomes and ~10x
for large genomes, but of course the higher resolutions achievable
with the thousands of vertebrate, arthropod and fungal BUSCO sets
do require longer run—times (Supplementary Table S2). Run—times
are generally proportional to the size of the BUSCO set used and the
sizes of the genomes being assessed, e.g. on 4 CPU cores with up to
8 GB memory: the 180 Mbp fruit ﬂy genome ran for 3.2—7.6 h,
while the 3381 Mbp human genome ran for 13—29 h with 843 meta—
zoan and 2675 arthropod or 3023 vertebrate BUSCOs, respectively
(Supplementary Table S2).

BUSCO quality assessments provide high—resolution quantifica—
tions citeable in the simple C[D],F,M,n notation for genomes, gene
sets and transcriptomes. This facilitates informative comparisons,
e.g. of newly sequenced draft genome assemblies to those of gold—
standard models, or to quantify iterative improvements to assem—
blies or annotations. BUSCO assessments therefore offer intuitive
metrics, based on evolutionarily informed expectations of gene con—
tent from hundreds of species, to gauge completeness of rapidly
accumulating genomic data and satisfy an Iberian’s quest for
quality—‘ano calidad/qualidade’.

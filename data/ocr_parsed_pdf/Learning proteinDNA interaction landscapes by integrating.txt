ABSTRACT

Motivation: Transcriptional regulation is directly enacted by the inter-
actions between DNA and many proteins, including transcription fac-
tors (T Fs), nucleosomes and polymerases. A critical step in
deciphering transcriptional regulation is to infer, and eventually predict,
the precise locations of these interactions, along with their strength
and frequency. While recent datasets yield great insight into these
interactions, individual data sources often provide only partial informa-
tion regarding one aspect of the complete interaction landscape. For
example, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChlP) reveals the binding
positions of a protein, but only for one protein at a time. In contrast,
nucleases like MNase and DNase can be used to reveal binding pos-
itions for many different proteins at once, but cannot easily determine
the identities of those proteins. Currently, few statistical frameworks
jointly model these different data sources to reveal an accurate, hol-
istic view of the in vivo protein—DNA interaction landscape.

Results: Here, we develop a novel statistical framework that inte-
grates different sources of experimental information within a thermo-
dynamic model of competitive binding to jointly learn a holistic view of
the in vivo protein—DNA interaction landscape. We show that our
framework learns an interaction landscape with increased accuracy,
explaining multiple sets of data in accordance with thermodynamic
principles of competitive DNA binding. The resulting model of genomic
occupancy provides a precise mechanistic vantage point from which
to explore the role of protein—DNA interactions in transcriptional
regulation.

1 INTRODUCTION

As an essential component of transcriptional regulation, the
interaction between DNA-binding factors (DBFs) and DNA
has been studied extensively. To map genome-wide proteini
DNA interactions experimentally, two basic categories of tech-
niques have been developed: ChIP—based methods (numerous
studies in many organisms, but a few examples for yeast are

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Harbison et al., 2004; Ren et al., 2000; Rhee and Pugh, 2011);
and nuclease digestion-based methods that proﬁle chromatin
with either DNase (Hesselberth et al., 2009) or MNase
(Henikoff et al., 2011). ChIP methods can be used to reveal
high-resolution DNA interaction sites for a single antibody-tar-
geted factor, especially the recently developed ChIP—exo methods
(Rhee and Pugh, 2011) that use lambda exonuclease to obtain
precise positions of protein binding. Nuclease digestion methods
can be used to efﬁciently assay genome-wide DNA occupancy of
all proteins at once, but without explicit information about pro-
tein identities. These and other experimental efforts over the past
decade have generated a large amount of data regarding the
chromatin landscape and its role in transcriptional regulation.
We now need computational models that can effectively integrate
these data to generate deeper insights into transcriptional
regulation.

A popular set of computational models use these data to
search for overrepresented DNA sequences bound by certain
DBFs; these are often applied in the setting of motif discovery
(Foat et al., 2006; Harbison et al., 2004; MacIsaac et al., 2006;
Tanay, 2006). More recently, models have been applied to
DNase-seq data to identify ‘digital footprints’ of DBFs (Chen
et al., 2010; Hesselberth et al., 2009; Luo and Hartemink, 2012;
Pique-Regi et al., 2011). However, many of these approaches
share certain drawbacks. First, protein binding is typically trea-
ted as a binary event amenable to classiﬁcation: either a protein
binds at a particular site on the DNA sequence or it does not.
However, both empirical and theoretical work has demonstrated
that proteins bind DNA with continuous occupancy levels [as
reviewed by Biggin (2011)]. Second, most computational meth-
ods model the binding events for one kind of protein at a time
instead of taking into consideration the interactions among dif-
ferent kinds of DBFs, especially nucleosomes. Although the
work of Kaplan et a]. (2011), Segal et a]. (2008) and Teif and
Rippe (2012) are notable exceptions, these all consider small gen-
omic regions and include only a few TFs; Segal et a]. (2008) did
not consider the role of nucleosomes. Third, and most import-
antly, almost all current methods fail to integrate different kinds
of datasets. This is suboptimal because data from one kind of
experiment only reveal partial information about the in vivo pro-
teiniDNA interaction landscape. For example, ChIP datasets
only contain binding information for one speciﬁc protein
under one speciﬁc condition; nuclease digestion datasets provide
binding information for all proteins, but do not reveal the

Learning protein-DNA interaction landscapes

 

identities of the proteins; and protein binding microarray (PBM)
experiments only look at sequence speciﬁcity of one isolated pro-
tein in an in vitro environment.

We previously developed a computational model of proteini
DNA interactions, termed COMPETE (Wasson and Hartemink,
2009), that overcomes the ﬁrst two drawbacks above by repre-
senting the competitive binding of proteins to DNA within a
thermodynamic ensemble. Interactions between proteins and
DNA are treated as probabilistic events, whose (continuous)
probabilities are calculated from a Boltzmann distribution.
COMPETE can easily include a large number of DBFs, including
nucleosomes, and can efﬁciently profile entire genomes with
single base-pair resolution. However, a limitation of COMPETE is
that it is a purely theoretical model of binding, based on thermo-
dynamic first principles but not guided by data regarding in vivo
binding events. Indeed, it is possible for COMPETE to predict
superﬂuous binding events that are inconsistent with observed
data (Supplementary Fig. S1). It is therefore necessary to develop
a new computational framework for jointly interpreting experi-
mentally derived data regarding genomic occupancy within a
model built on the thermodynamic foundation of COMPETE.

Here, we develop just such a method: a general framework
that combines a thermodynamic model for proteiniDNA inter-
actions and a new statistical model for learning from experimen-
tal observations regarding those interactions. Information from
different experimental observations can be integrated to infer the
thermodynamic interactions between DBFs and a genome. In
this particular study, we demonstrate the use of this framework
by integrating paired-end MNase-seq data, which reveal infor-
mation about the binding occupancy of both nucleosomes and
smaller (subnucleosomal) factors. Our framework also integrates
protein binding speciﬁcity information from PBM data and
produces a more accurate and realistic proteiniDNA interaction
landscape than COMPETE alone, along with a mechanistic explan-
ation of MNase-digested fragments of different sizes. The cross-
Validated performance of our framework is signiﬁcantly higher
than several baselines with which we compared it. Our frame-
work is ﬂexible and can easily incorporate other data sources as
well, and thus represents a general modeling framework for
integrating multiple sources of information to produce a more
precise View of the interaction landscape undergirding transcrip-
tional regulation.

2 METHODS

2.1 Modeling protein—DNA interaction

We model the binding of DBFs (e.g. TFs and nucleosomes) to DNA
along a probabilistic continuum, and we incorporate explicit competition
between different DBFs. The ensemble average of the probability with
which a particular DBF binds to a speciﬁc position of the sequence can be
derived from thermodynamic principles. To calculate this average prob-
ability, consider a speciﬁc binding conﬁguration 1' from the ensemble,
where i can be viewed as an instantaneous snapshot of the dynamic
competition between DBFs for binding sites along the genome.
Following the Boltzmann distribution, the unnormalized probability w,-
of conﬁguration 1' can be shown to be

Ni
w,- = 1‘1 X. x P(S,, E, IDBFt)

t=l

where t is an index over the N,- DBF binding sites in conﬁguration 1', X,
denotes a weight associated with DBF t, while S, and E, denote the start
and end position of the DBF binding site, respectively. P(S,, E,|DBF,) is
the probability of observing the DNA sequence between S, and E,, given
that DBF t is bound there. To simplify notation, we have treated each
unbound nucleotide as being bound by a special kind of ‘empty’ DBF. If
we use p,- to denote the probability of conﬁguration 1' after normalization
by the partition function, we can write the probability that DBF t binds

at a speciﬁc position j as Ziemﬂpi, where I(t, j) is the subset of binding

conﬁgurations in the ensemble that have DBF t bound at sequence pos-
ition j.

This model can be formulated analogously to a hidden Markov model
(HMM) (Rabiner, 1989), in which the states correspond to the binding of
different DBFs and the observations are the DNA sequence. The various
probabilities, along with the partition function, can then be calculated
efﬁciently using the forwardibackward algorithm. For TFs, we have
chosen to represent P(S,, E,|DBF,), using a position weight matrix
(PWM), but more sophisticated models can also be used [e.g. relaxing
positional independence, or based on energies rather than probabilities
(W eirauch et al., 2013)]. Regardless, binding models from different sources
and of different forms can be easily incorporated into our model, generat-
in g the appropriate states and sequence emission probabilities. We use the
curated PWMs from Gordan et a]. (2011), derived from in vitro PBM
experiments, as the input protein binding speciﬁcities and consider them
ﬁxed (though our framework also could allow them to be updated).

The analogues of HMM transition probabilities in our model are the
DBF weights, but these are not constrained to be probabilities. To allow
this ﬂexibility, we adopt a more general statistical framework called a
Boltzmann chain (Saul and Jordan, 1995), which can be understood as an
HMM that allows the use of any positive real numbers for these weights.
Because of the analogy with an HMM, we henceforth refer to these DBF
weights as ‘transition weights’ and denote them collectively as a vector
X= (X1, X2, . . . , XD), where D is the number of different kinds of DBFs.
We treat the D elements of X as free parameters, and we will ﬁt them
using experimentally derived genomic data.

We should note that the DBF transition weights in a Boltzmann chain
are sometimes called ‘concentrations’. However, it is important to point
out that these transition weights are not the same as bulk cellular protein
concentrations, of the kind that can sometimes be measured experimen-
tally (Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003). Bulk cellular protein concentrations
are not necessarily indicative of the availability of a DBF to bind DNA
because they do not account for phenomena like subcellular localization
or extranuclear sequestration, protein activation through post-transla-
tional modiﬁcation or ligand or co-factor binding, or the number of
DBFs already bound to DNA. In contrast, our transition weights cor-
respond to nuclear concentrations of active proteins that are free and
available to bind DNA. In this sense, our weight parameters are more
reasonably interpreted not as cellular concentrations but rather as the
chemical potentials of the DBFs for interacting with the genome.

2.2 Using paired-end MNase-seq data as a measure of
genomic occupancy level of DNA-binding proteins

We used paired-end MNase-seq data from Henikoff et a]. (2011). Based
on their protocol, the length of the sequencing fragments correspond
roughly to the size of the protein protecting that part of the DNA; the
number of fragments mapping to the location correlates with the binding
strength or occupancy. Therefore, to measure the level of occupancy of
different DNA binding proteins, we separate the fragments into long
(14(F200 bp) and short ((FIOO bp) fragment groups, and count the
number of fragments in each group that cover a speciﬁc genomic location
(called long and short fragment coverage, respectively). The long frag-
ment coverage is used as a measure of the occupancy of large protein
complexes, which are mainly nucleosomes, while the short fragment

J.Zhong et al.

 

coverage is used as a measure of the occupancy of smaller proteins, which
are mainly TFs.

To reduce noise in the MNase-seq data, we process the noisy fragment
data into binding profiles through thresholding and smoothing. We
deﬁne two thresholds: a bottom threshold Tb and a top threshold T,.
Coverage values that are below Tb are converted to 0, while those
above T, are converted to 1; coverage values between the two thresholds
are normalized linearly to [0,1]. We then smooth the track using a
Gaussian kernel of bandwidth Bm. We process long and short fragment
coverage data separately to get the large and small protein binding pro-
ﬁles, respectively (Fig. 1D and E). We choose Tb = 200 and T, = 500,
with E,,, = 10 for short fragment coverage and E,,, = 30 for long fragment
coverage. These values give satisfying results in terms of reducing noise
while retaining clear peaks. We performed a sensitivity analysis and
observed that our results are largely unaffected across a broad range of
these parameters (Supplementary Fig. S2). We also note that MNase is
known to prefer to cut A/T compared with G/C. We assessed the severity
of this well-known bias (Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4) and observed
that it does not affect our ﬁnal results, primarily because we are not using
proﬁles of the total number of cuts at each genomic position, but rather
using the full fragments to generate proﬁles of fragment coverage; while
the former might be sensitive to MNase bias, the latter is relatively in-
sensitive to the small ﬂuctuations in fragment end locations introduced by
MNase bias.

2.3 Selecting a subset of TFs and promoter regions

Our framework has the capability to include all Saccharomyces cerevisiae
TFs. However, our choice of TFs is limited by available high-quality
binding preference data. In addition, adding more TFs increases the
dimensionality of the parameter space and therefore the computation
time required to explore the space. In this study, we chose a set of 42
TFs with available high-quality binding preference data. These TFs cover
a wide range of cellular functions including the widely studied transcrip-
tional regulators Rebl, Rap], and Abfl (possessing chromatin

remodeling activity), TFs involved in pheromone response (Ste12 and
Tecl), TFs involved in stress response (like Msn4), and TFs involved in
cell cycle regulation (Fkhl, Mbpl, and so forth). We also included some
TFs, like Pho2 and Phdl, that regulate a large number of genes according
to MacIsaac et al. (2006). While these 42 do not represent all yeast TFs,
they are collectively responsible for 66% of the genome-wide proteini
DNA interactions reported by MacIsaac et al. (2006) (at P<0.005 and
conservation level 3).

Having selected our 42 TFs, we next chose a set of promoter regions
that, according to MacIsaac et al. (2006) (at P< 0.005 and conservation
level 3), are bound exclusively by those TFs. For this study, we focus on
81 such promoter regions. We extracted MNase-seq data for these loci as
follows. If the promoter is divergently transcribed, we extracted the
MNase-seq data between the two TATA elements, plus 200 bp down-
stream of each TATA element. For the other (non-divergent) promoters,
we extracted MNase-seq data 500 bp upstream of the TATA element (or
100 bp upstream of the end of the upstream gene, whichever is smaller),
and 200 bp downstream of the TATA element. Locations of TATA elem-
ents were taken from Rhee and Pugh (2012).

2.4 Incorporating MNase-seq data through an objective
function

We model MNase-seq data through a pseudo-likelihood function. To
calculate the function, we process the COMPETE output TF binding prob-
abilities as follows: the binding probability of each TF binding event is
expanded to a ﬂanking region of Ce bp and is then dropped linearly to 0
for another C, bp; we then sum the probabilities of all TFs (truncating
values >1) and smooth the track using a Gaussian kernel of bandwidth BC
to get a composite TF binding proﬁle (Fig. 1C). We process the occu-
pancy proﬁle in such a way for two reasons: (i) the resolution of the short
fragment coverage does not distinguish protection from adjacent pro-
teins, and (ii) MNase does not completely digest all unprotected DNA,
leaving some additional nucleotides ﬂanking any TF’s actual binding site.
We choose C, = C, = B, = 10, though, as with the threshold and

genome position, as calculated by COMPETE, given current DBF weights. We then separate these probabilities into two proﬁles: (B) predicted nucleosome
binding proﬁle and (C) predicted composite TF binding proﬁle in which protein identities have been removed; the latter is smoothed to make it
comparable with a short fragment coverage proﬁle. Similarly, we separate the observed MNase-seq fragments (F) into long (1407200 bp) and short ((F
100 bp) fragments, which are summed to produce measures of coverage. (D) Total long fragment coverage is processed into a large protein binding
proﬁle, which is compared with predicted nucleosomal binding, arriving at Pearson correlation r1. (E) Total short fragment coverage is processed into a
small protein binding proﬁle, which is compared with predicted composite TF binding, arriving at Pearson correlation r2. For this promoter, the quantity
h that appears in our objective function (the pseudo-likelihood) is simply the geometric mean of the two correlations, after they are rescaled to lie in the
interval [0,1]: h = %,/(1 -l- r1) x (1 -l- r2). The complete pseudo-likelihood over all promoters is then optimized with respect to the DBF weights using the

inference method described below

bandwidth parameters discussed above, varying the speciﬁc values tends
to have only small effects on the model predictions. We do not process
the nucleosome proﬁle predicted by COMPETE, as the model already takes
nucleosome padding into consideration. We also capture the effect of the
pre-initiation complex (PIC) on the MNase-seq proﬁle by adding an
empirical PIC protection shape to the predicted binding proﬁle
(Supplementary Text and Supplementary Fig. SS).

For promoter region m, we calculate two correlations: the Pearson
correlation er between the nucleosome binding proﬁle and the
MNase-seq large protein coverage proﬁle, and the Pearson correlation
r2,” between the composite TF binding proﬁle and the MNase-seq small
protein coverage proﬁle. The complete pseudo-likelihood function we
seek to maximize is deﬁned as

M
L(X)= 11 11mm
m=l

where hm(X)= %,/(1 +r1,m) x (1 +r2,m), the geometric mean of the

two rescaled correlations for promoter region m (an example is shown
in Fig. 1). Note that hm(X) depends on the vector of DBF weights X. In
this study, M = 81.

2.5 Inference method

We use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to explore a posterior
distribution based on the pseudo-likelihood function. However, as cor-
relation measures the overall goodness of fit for many genomic locations
at once, our pseudo-likelihood function is much ﬂatter than typical like-
lihood functions. This property can be useful in preventing overﬁtting,
but it also imposes some difﬁculty for parameter inference. To alleviate
this concern and allow for more efﬁcient MCMC exploration, we apply a
temperature parameter r to each dimension of the search space to con-
centrate the mass of L(X) around its modes. We apply a possibly different
temperature to each dimension (i.e. each element of the vector X) because
the pseudo-likelihood in one dimension may be more or less ﬂat than in
others. We base our choice of temperature parameter on the MCMC
acceptance rate, and empirically set 1: for each dimension to be one of
{0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.002}. Note that none of these choices change the local
maxima of our objective function in any way; they simply may make
convergence more efﬁcient.

As for the prior over X, a nice feature of our framework is that we can
use non-uniform priors if there is reason to do so; later, we explore the
possibility of including mildly informative priors for certain TFs where
measurements of cellular concentrations in S.cerevisiae are available
(Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003). However, when no relevant information
is available, a uniform prior distribution is a natural choice. In what
follows, we use a uniform prior over [—10, 2] for log transition weights
of TFs and a uniform prior over [0, 3] for the log transition weight of
nucleosomes. Such values are chosen based on the range of TF dissoci-
ation constants at their respective optimal binding sites [K4, as deﬁned
and computed by Granek and Clarke (2005)]: TF Sigl has the highest log
K, value of 72.5 and TF Asgl has the lowest log K, value of 77.6.

In our Gibbs-style MCMC, each iteration consists of an update for
each of the transition weight parameters in the model. On a commodity
computer cluster, we could compute roughly 25 such iterations per hour.

Fig. 2. Comparison of cross-validated inference performance with vari-
ous baselines. Data from the 81 promoter regions were split into nine
equal parts. A standard 9-fold cross-validation procedure was applied: 72
promoter regions were used as training data to obtain trained DBF
weights X; we then calculated h(X) values of the nine held out promoter
regions (testing results). ‘Cross validation training’ considers the h(X)
values for each promoter when used as training data. ‘Cross validation
testing’ shows the h(X) values for each promoter when used as testing
data. Uniformly randomly drawn TF transition weights and different
multiples of K, are used as baseline comparisons. Variance is reduced
in the random baseline case because each result is the average of 1000
random samples

weights X; we then calculated h(X) values for the nine held out
promoter regions. Figure 2 shows boxplots of h(X) values of all
the training and testing promoter regions from all the folds of
cross-validation. We compare the performance to five baselines:
average performance when log transition weights are drawn 1000
times uniformly under the prior; or setting the nucleosome tran-
sition weight to 35 and TF transition weights to 8 Kd, 16 Kd,
32 Kd 01‘  Kd.

As Figure 2 shows, our learned model outperforms all five
baselines signiﬁcantly. Note that h(X)=0.5 indicates no correl-
ation on average between the model predictions and observed
data. Median performance for the random baseline is still >0.5
even with uninformed TF transition weights; this is because the
model’s emission parameters (derived from in vitro experimental
data regarding TF and nucleosome binding speciﬁcity) are highly
informed.

3.2 A mechanistic explanation for paired-end MNase-seq
data

Owing to in vitro experiments, our model has knowledge about
inherent DBF sequence specificities. The thermodynamic inter-
action and competition between these DBFs are accounted for
by COMPETE. By adding information about in vivo DBF binding
occupancy levels present in MNase-seq data, our framework can
now infer a DBF binding landscape that provides a mechanistic
explanation for the observed data.

Figure 3 illustrates examples of predicted binding proﬁles for
each DBF in six promoter regions in the test sets of the 9-fold
cross-validation, in comparison with the corresponding MNase-
seq binding proﬁle tracks (see Supplementary Fig. S4 for raw
coverage and Supplementary Fig. S6 for additional comparisons
between composite predicted proﬁles and processed MNase-seq
fragment coverages). These examples span the full spectrum of

(P<0.001 and conservation level 3) for these promoter regions

our framework performance, from strong performance to weak
performance. In all cases, our predictions for the TF binding
profiles provide a good or fair explanation for the MNase-seq
data and are much more consistent with the data compared with
random baseline predictions (Supplementary Fig. S1).

One difﬁculty in interpreting high-throughput nuclease diges-
tion data is identifying DBFs at read-enriched regions.
Traditional motif matching is not satisfactory when there are
multiple potentially overlapping motifs, nor can it assess the
strength of protein binding. In contrast, our framework provides
a principled interpretation for the data in terms of distinct bind-
ing events, each with its own probability of occurrence based on
evaluating the probability of every possible binding conﬁgur-
ation in the ensemble. This is demonstrated, for example, in
the YDL012C and YPR016C promoter regions. Our approach
can also capture weak binding events, such as the Rebl binding
events in the YPR016C and YNL157W promoter regions, which
are missed in ChIP-chip experiments (MacIsaac et al., 2006) but
are captured in ChIP-exo experiments (Rhee and Pugh, 2011;
Fig. 3).

Our predictions of nucleosome binding proﬁles match the
data well in spite of the fact that nucleosome positioning is

less precise than TF positioning. The predictions reﬂect the in-
trinsic uncertainty about nucleosome positioning related to their
mobility and only mild sequence preferences, especially when the
MNase-seq large protein binding proﬁle is more noisy, as in the
promoter regions of YBL014C and YNL157W (Figure 3; see
Supplementary Fig. S4 for raw coverage).

3.3 Incorporating measurements of protein concentration
through prior distributions

We have demonstrated that our framework can achieve good
performance using non-informative priors. However, the frame-
work could potentially perform better by incorporating prior
information when it is available. For instance, Ghaemmaghami
et al. (2003) measured cellular protein concentrations using
western blots in S.cerevisiae during log phase growth. As dis-
cussed above, although cellular protein concentrations are not
precisely equivalent to the transition weights we are estimating,
the two still might be expected to loosely correlate with one an-
other. We can therefore use these measurements to construct
weak prior distributions for the corresponding DBF transition

Fig. 4. Comparison of cross-validation performance with and without
prior information regarding measured cellular protein concentration.
Performance for each promoter is measured by the geometric mean
[h(X)] of the two Pearson correlations deﬁned in Figure 1. Each boxplot
shows the performance summary of the 81 promoter regions across all the
cross-validation trials

well as experimental measurement error, we use a truncated
normal prior for log transition weights with a large standard
deviation (SD) of 2 (so 1 SD in each direction corresponds to
multiplying the weight by 1/ 100 or 100, respectively). We calcu-
late the mean for this normal prior by converting measurements
from Ghaemmaghami et al. (2003) to molar concentration using
a yeast cell volume of 5 x 10’14 L (Bryan et al., 2010). The
resulting prior means are in the range of 78 to 76 in log scale.
Note that nine of the 42 TFs in our model do not have meas-
urements available, and thus their priors remain uniform, as
described above.

When we use this prior information, we observe no change
in training performance and a marginal increase in testing
performance (median h(X) increases by 0.013; Fig. 4). Such an
insigniﬁcant result could arise for multiple reasons: (i) the afore-
mentioned difference between cellular concentration and the
model’s transition weights means that the information provided
by the measured concentrations might not even be relevant,
(ii) the noisy physiological measurements of both cellular con-
centration and cell volume means that the measurements we used
might not be accurate, or (iii) the weak prior that we used in the
model because the measured concentrations are not trusted to be
precise means that the objective function landscape might change
only slightly.

4 DISCUSSION

We show that integrating information from experimental data
within a general framework built on a thermodynamic ensemble
model of competitive factor binding can improve the accuracy of
inferred proteineDNA interactions, providing a more biologic-
ally plausible View of the proteineDNA interaction landscape.
Such a landscape gives a mechanistic explanation for observed
paired-end MNase-seq fragments through various protein-bind-
ing events, each with its own probability of occurrence. Many of
those binding events are weak binding events that are typically
missed in other modeling methods, but are captured in our
framework; these weaker binding events are also supported by
higher resolution experimental data where available (Rhee and

Pugh, 2012). These weak binding events are important: it has
been reported that low-afﬁnity proteineDNA interactions may
be involved in ﬁne-tuning transcriptional regulation and are
common along the genome (Biggin, 2011; Segal et al., 2008;
Tanay, 2006). Our framework’s predictions agree with this View-
point: 72% of the binding events in our predicted proﬁles have a
binding probability less than 0.5. Our framework could thus
form an important basis for future computational work that
connects transcriptional activity with the proteineDNA inter-
action landscape.

Our framework does not successfully predict a few TF binding
events reported by high-resolution ChIP-exo experiments (Rhee
and Pugh, 2011), most notably some of the binding sites for Phd1
and Rebl. We believe the primary reason is occasional mis-
matches between our input TF PWMs and these proteins’
actual in vivo DNA-binding speciﬁcities. For Phd1, Rhee and
Pugh (2012) reported several distinct in vivo motifs. However,
the Phd1 PWM we used in our framework comes from in vitro
data (Zhu et al., 2009) and does not match the in vivo DNA-
binding speciﬁcity of Phd1 reported by Rhee and Pugh (2012).
Similarly, for Rebl, Rhee and Pugh (2012) reported that 40% of
Rebl binding sites are so—called ‘secondary binding sites’, with
motifs that deviate from the TTAGGC consensus of the in vitro
PWM we used. This mismatch in DNA-binding speciﬁcity may
account for much of the discrepancy between our predicted pro-
ﬁles and reported binding sites. However, some caution should
be taken when interpreting in vivo ChIP data, as the assay cannot
distinguish between direct proteineDNA interaction and indirect
interaction (Gordan et al., 2009). We also note that our current
framework only includes a subset of all yeast TFs. Some unex-
plained short fragment coverage peaks, such as those in the
YBL014C promoter region, could indicate the binding of
DBFs that are not in our set. These and other discrepancies
may have an impact on our overall inference, resulting in missing
binding events (or possibly even superﬂuous binding events, be-
cause of the competition that is inherent in our model).

In the promoters of YNL157W and YDL012C, our predic-
tions do not include Rapl binding events even though they are
reported in ChIP-exo experiments. However, we believe this
results from the nature of Rapl binding: Lickwar et al. (2012)
report that Rapl binding on non-ribosomal protein promoters,
like the two mentioned above, is highly dynamic and involves
fast turnover. Such binding events are possibly captured in ChIP
experiments because of cross-linking, but may be difﬁcult to ob-
serve in an MNase-based digestion experiment if the latter does
not involve a cross-linking step. Incidentally, the two ChIP-deter-
mined Rapl binding events are not close to MNase-seq small
fragment coverage peaks. One possible use of our framework for
extending the results shown here would be to incorporate data
from ChIP-based experiments and use the framework to estimate
parameters that reﬂect information from both kinds of data.

We demonstrate the use of prior information in our frame-
work through incorporating measured bulk cellular protein con-
centration. The model performance improved marginally, which
can be interpreted two ways. On the one hand, it is reassuring
that one need not have measured cellular protein concentrations
to perform effective inference. The fact that our uniform priors
work as well as having priors informed by measured concentra-
tions means that the measured concentrations available currently

are not critical for good performance. However, that said, it is
also reassuring that our framework has the ability to incorporate
this sort of prior information when available because we antici-
pate such data will only improve. As measurement technologies
enable us to move from bulk cellular concentrations toward
nuclear concentrations of active TFs, we anticipate that the
ability to incorporate prior information will become more
useful, if not for achieving better results then perhaps at least
for more rapid convergence toward optima when we move to
higher-dimensional inference (e. g. more TFs).

With adequately fitted parameters, our framework has the
potential to perform in silico simulation for various environmen-
tal conditions by changing the protein concentrations. For
example, we could simulate in silico heat shock by increasing
the concentration of heat shock response factors in our model.
We could also investigate how certain single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNP) affect the overall proteineDNA interaction
landscape, not just at the site of the SNP but propagating to
the surrounding region because of altered competition.

This work represents a first step toward a more general frame-
work. By specifying probabilistic distributions appropriate for
other kinds of experimentsilike ChIP-seq, FAIRE-seq or
DNase-seqithe framework can integrate other sources of data
through a joint likelihood. As more and larger-scale sequencing
projects are carried out, such a framework will prove valuable for
integrating different pieces of information to infer a more precise
View of the proteineDNA interactions that govern transcrip-
tional regulation.

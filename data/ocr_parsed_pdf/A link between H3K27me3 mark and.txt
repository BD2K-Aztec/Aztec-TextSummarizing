ABSTRACT

We conducted a reanalysis of genome-wide histone H3 tail
methylation data in mammalian pluripotent and differentiated cells.
We show that the promoters marked with histone H3 lysine 27
trimethylation (H3K27me3) tend to have more exonic positions in
the promoter regions. However, this is not due to any preferential
marking on exons over introns by H3K27me3. The relationship is
also independent the status of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation
(H3K4me3) mark, CpG content and the platforms used in the high-
throughput profiling of histone modifications. It provides evidence
for the link between histone modifications and transcribed exons in
promoter regions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Histone modiﬁcation is Closely related to cellular states and gene
regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) combined with
Chip or sequencing technologies has been a powerful tool to map
the genome-wide distribution of histone modiﬁcations. The high-
resolution maps of several key histone modiﬁcations have been
obtained for the embryonic stem (ES) cells and the differentiated cell
lineages (Barski et (11., 2007; Guenther et (11., 2007; Mikkelsen et (11.,
2007; Fan et (11., 2007; Zhao et (11., 2007). Among the modiﬁcations
on histone tails, histone H3 lysine 4 and lysine 27 methylation are
of particular interest. Genes with the promoters marked by histone
H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) but not histone H3 lysine
27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) are actively expressed. Genes with
the promoters marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (termed
‘bivalent domains’) are poised for expression, and those with
only H3K27me3 marks are stably repressed (reviewed in Bibikova
et (11., 2008). These modiﬁcations are catalyzed by trithorax- and
Polycomb-group proteins, respectively. The proteins mediate the
epigenetic inheritance of lineage-speciﬁc gene expression patterns
and have important ﬁlnction in development (Ringrose and Paro,
2004). All of these reﬂect the central role of H3K4me3 and
H3K27me3 in the maintenance of pluripotent state and the lineage
potential.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Another histone modiﬁcation H3K36me3 has been reported to be
associated with transcriptional elongation (Bibikova et (11., 2008).
More recent studies show that exons are preferentially marked
with H3K36me3 relative to introns, which indicates a dynamic link
between transcription and splicing (Kolasinska-Zwierz et (11., 2009).
Intragenic histone hyper-acetylation affects nearby alternative
splicing, which further indicates the coupling of transcription and
splicing through histone modiﬁcations (Schor et (11., 2009). In
addition, it has been reported that RNA-directed transcriptional
gene silencing (TGS) can be initiated through promoter-targeted
siRNAs and the targeted promoters are marked with silent histone
H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 (Han et (11., 2007; Morris et (11., 2004).
During TGS, low-copy of promoter-associated RNAs are transcribed
(e. g. RNAs transcribed from upstream promoter in Close proximity)
and recognized by the antisense strand of the siRNA to mediate
TGS (Han et (11., 2007). These results indicate that transcribed
RNAs are Closely related to histone modiﬁcations. Here, we explore
the relationship between H3K27me3 modiﬁcation and the RNA
transcribed from the same promoter. Speciﬁcally, we found that the
promoters marked by H3K27me3 tend to have more exonic positions
in the promoter regions, which further indicates the potential
relationship between histone modiﬁcations and transcribed RNAs.

2 METHODS

We assembled 19 824 promoters (between —0.5 and +2 kb of the annotated
transcript start site) from the mouse Refseq transcripts (downloaded from
the UCSC genome browser. version mm9) and 20 181 promoters from
the human Refseq transcripts (version hng). Here. the transcript start
site means the ﬁrst base of annotated transcript. Note that if a gene had
alternative promoters. these different promoters were analyzed separately.
The (—0.5 and +2 kb) region was commonly used as the promoter region in
histone modiﬁcation studies (e.g. Ku et (11.. 2008; Mikkelsen et (11.. 2007).
We call these promoter sets the ‘full’ promoter sets. The annotated transcript
start site may be inaccurate and the identiﬁcation of transcription start sites
is still a challenging subject. To achieve a better-deﬁned promoter set. we
focused on the transcripts with validated transcription start sites. In particular.
we selected the transcripts with at least one full-length cDNA starting from
a position within 10 bp of the annotated transcript start site. The position
was treated as the start site of the ﬁrst exon (i.e. the transcript start site).
If a transcript had more than one such position. the position supported by
the most number of full-length cDNAs was selected. The full-length cDNA
information was from the DBTSS database (Wakaguri at (11.. 2008). A total of
4968 mouse promoters and 3694 human promoters were identiﬁed according
to the criteria. We call these promoter sets the ‘conservative’ promoter sets.

If a promoter overlaps with a genomic interval enriched with a speciﬁc
chromatin modiﬁcation. the promoter is said to be marked by that chromatin
modiﬁcation. The histone modiﬁcation data were from Mikkelsen et a1.

(2007) and Meissner et a1. (2008) including the ChIP-seq data for mouse ES
cells, neural progenitor (NP) cells, embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) and brain;
the ChIP-seq (Ku et (11., 2008) and ChIP-chip (Pan at (11., 2007) data for
human ES cells. The genomic intervals enriched with a histone modiﬁcation,
which were inferred based on sliding window approach or hidden Markov
model approach, were obtained from the original papers. For the ‘full’
promoter sets, we removed 2138 mouse promoters and 1235 human
promoters that correspond to transcripts with length <2 kb. Most of them
are olfactory receptors with single coding-exon. And majority of them were
not marked with either H3K27me3 or H3K4me3. For the ‘conservative’
promoter sets, we removed 260 mouse promoters and 116 human promoters
that correspond to transcripts with length <2 kb. Therefore, we ﬁnally
had 17686 mouse promoters and 18946 human promoters for the ‘full’
promoter sets, and 4708 mouse promoter and 3578 human promoters for the
‘conservative’ promoter sets.

A gene may have multiple promoters, then these promoters were analyzed
separately and independently. The sequence properties (e.g. exon length) of
a promoter were calculated based on the isoform starting from the promoter.
Other isoforms starting from different promoters did not interfere with the
calculation. In the ‘full’ promoter sets, there were 767 (5%) mouse genes and
1587 (9%) human genes with more than one promoter. In the ‘conservative’
promoter sets, there were 23 (0.5%) mouse genes and 29 (0.8%) human
genes with more than one promoter. In addition, a promoter may correspond
to multiple transcript isoforms. Those isoforms shared the same promoter
and had different downstream splicing events. For the ﬁnal ‘full’ promoter
sets, ~6% of the mouse promoters and 17% of the human promoters were
shared by more than one transcript isoform. For the ﬁnal ‘conservative’
promoter sets, the percentage was 3 and 12% for the mouse and human
promoters, respectively. For the promoters corresponding to one transcript
isoform, the exonic and intronic positions were counted directly. For the
promoters shared by multiple isoforms, the positions appearing in all of the
transcript isoforms were counted as exonic positions. The positions spliced
out from all of the isoforms were counted as intronic positions. The other
positions were alternative positions. Only 1% of the mouse and 4% of the
human ‘full’ promoters had alternative positions in the promoter region. For
majority of the promoters shared by multiple isoforms, the transcript isoforms
had alternative splicing events >2 kb downstream of the transcript start site
(with no alternative positions in the promoter region). These alternative
splicing events did not interfere with the calculation of the promoter sequence
properties.

The number of exonic positions (excluding alternative positions) on
the pre-mRNA level overlapping the promoter was counted and we call
it ‘pExon-length’. We also calculated the length of the 5’ UTR region
overlapping with the promoter (‘p5’ UTR-length’), the length of the ﬁrst
exon (‘lst Exon-length’), the length of other exonic region (except the ﬁrst
exon) overlapping with the promoter (‘pOtherExon-length’), and the length
of the transcript (‘Trs-length’). For promoters shared by multiple isoforms,
the average lengths from the isoforms were used. Promoters containing a
500 bp interval within —0.5 to +2 kb with a (G+C) fraction 30.55 and a
CpG observed to expected ratio (O/E)Z 0.6 were classiﬁed as high CpG
promoters (HCPs). Other promoters were classiﬁed as non-HCPs. All of the
statistical tests were performed using software R.

3 RESULTS

We observed that the H3K27me3 enrichment was associated with
the number of exonic positions in the promoter region (‘pExon-
length’). Figure 1Aplot the ‘pExon-length’ for the promoters marked
with H3K27me3 and the promoters without H3K27me3 mark. The
promoters were from the ‘ﬁill’ promoter sets. It Clearly shows that
the promoter marked with H3K27me3 tended to have more exonic
positions (the P-values based on the Wilcoxon test < 2.2 X 10—16).
If a promoter was consistently marked with H3K27me3 across

multiple tissue and cell lines, it tended to have more exonic positions
(Fig. 1B). Among the 391 mouse promoters with the ‘pExon-length’
equal to 2kb (i.e. the ﬁrst exon is 32 kb), 48% of them were marked
with H3K27me3 in at least one cell line or tissue. For the remaining
promoters with the ‘pExon-length’ <2 kb, only 22% of them were
marked with H3k27me3 in at least one cell line or tissue. The
P-value based on the XZ-test is < 2.2 X 10—16. This association was
also observed in human ES cells for both ChIP-seq and ChIP-Chip
data (Fig. 1C). It shows that the association between ‘pExon-length’
and H3K27me3 is independent of the high-throughput platforms.
Similarly, the XZ-test was performed to compare the proportion of
the marked promoters among the promoters with the ‘pExon-length’
equal to 2kb and the proportion among the promoters with the
‘pExon-length’ <2 kb. The P-value is 2.4 X 10—5 for the ChIP-seq
data and 9.4 X 10—15 for the ChIP-Chip data. For the ‘Conservative’
promoter sets, the results were similar (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Table 1 lists the correlations between the histone modiﬁcation
signals and the ‘pExon-length’ and other parameters. The
modiﬁcation signal was the number of sequence reads mapped to
the promoter for the ChIP-seq data or the average probe intensity
in the promoter for the ChIP-Chip data. The ‘pExon-length’ had
a signiﬁcant positive correlation with the H3K27me3 signal for
all of the considered cell lines and for both the ‘full’ promoter
sets and the ‘Conservative’ promoter sets. However, the correlation
between the ‘pExon-length’ and H3K4me3 was positive for some
cell lines and negative for other cell lines, indicating inconsistent
patterns between cell lines. The magnitude of the correlation was
small and the P-value could be as high as 0.54 for the human ES
cells. In addition, the H3K27me3 signal had a stronger association
with the ‘pExon-length’ than with the 5’ UTR length in the
promoter region (‘p5’ UTR-length’) and the length of the ﬁrst exon
(‘1st Exon-length’). The latter two were highly correlated with the
‘pExon-length’ (the correlations among these three parameters were

Histone modiﬁcation signal was the number of sequence reads mapped to the promoter or the average probe intensity for the promoter. Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients were
calculated, between the number of exonic positions overlapping with the promoter region (‘pExon-length’) and the H3K27me3 signal; between the ‘pExon-length’ and the H3K4me3
signal; between the length 5’ UTR region overlapping with the promoter region (‘pS’ UTR-length’) and the H3K27me3 signal; between the length of the ﬁrst exon (‘lst Exon-length’)
and the H3K27me3 signal; between the length of other exonic region (except the ﬁrst exon) overlapping with the promoter (‘pOtherExon-length’) and the H3K27me3 signal; and

between the length of the whole transcript (‘Trs-length’) and the H3K27me3 signal.

about 0.46—0.78). If we removed the contribution from the ﬁrst
exon to the ‘pExon-length’ calculation, the ‘pOtherExon-length’ still
had a signiﬁcant positive correlation with the H3K27me3 signal
(all P-values were <0.05). It indicates that the ﬁrst exon length
is probably the most important but not the only reason for the
correlation between the ‘pExon-length’ and the H3K27me3 signal.
In addition, we considered the whole transcript length (‘Trs-length’).
The correlations between the H3K27me3 signal and the ‘Trs-length’
were small and were not consistent between the high-throughput
platforms, and some of the P-values were >0.05.

To understand whether the association between H3K27me3 and
the ‘pExon-length’ is a secondary effect of nuCleosome occupancy,
we studied the proﬁle of non-modiﬁed histone positions. We
investigated the relationship between nuCleosome density and
‘pExon-length’. Mikkelsen e1 (11. (2007) proﬁled the histone H3
positions in the mouse ES cells using the Pan-H3 antibodies. By
analyzing the data, we found that the correlation between the histone
H3-occupancy and the ‘pExon-length’ was —0.070 for the ‘ﬁill’
promoter set and —0.068 for the ‘Conservative’ promoter set. When
we normalized the H3K27me3 signal by the pan-H3 signal (the
H3K27me3 reads mapped to the promoter/ the pan-H3 reads mapped
to the promoter), the correlation between the normalized H3K27me3
signal and the ‘pExon-length’ was 0.23 and 0.22 for the ‘ﬁill’

and ‘Conservative’ promoter sets (the P-values for the correlations
<2.2 x 10—16). The results indicate that the correlation between
H3K27me3 and the ‘pExon-length’ is not due to the correlation
between H3K27me3 and the nuCleosome-occupancy. It may be
noteworthy to mention that the nuCleosome-occupancy level tends
to be higher in internal exons than in introns (Andersson e1 (11., 2009;
SChwartz e1 (11., 2009; Tilgner e1 (11., 2009). Here, we focused on the
promoter-region exons instead of the internal exons.

Promoters can be marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3.
The association between the ‘pExon-length’ and the H3K27me3
signal in the promoter region was, however, independent of the
H3K4me3 status as shown in Figure 2A (the ‘full’ promoter set
was used). When comparing the ‘pExon-length’ of H3K27me3+ and
H3K4me3+ promoters, and the ‘pExon-length’ of H3K27me3+ and
H3K4me3— promoters, the P-values based on the Wilcoxon tests
were >0.05. CpG islands are important epigenetiC and functional
regulatory elements and it has been shown that the H3K27me3
signals are enriChed in the promoter CpG islands (Mikkelsen e1 (11.,
2007; Roh e1 (11., 2006). To study whether the association between
the ‘pExon-length’ and the H3K27me3 signal is dependent on
the CpG percentage, we divided our promoters into HCPs and
non-HCPs. Figure 2B shows that the association was independent
of the CpG percentage. If the HCPs or the non-HCPs were

consistently marked with H3K27me3, they tended to have longer
‘pExon-length’. The results for the ‘Conservative’ promoter set was
similar (Supplementary Fig. 2). Besides the promoter CpG level,
we also considered the GC content outside of the promoter regions.
Speciﬁcally, we calculated the GC content in the downstream
(2 and 20 kb) region of the transcript start site. The GC content in the
large region contains information about the genomiC compositional
structures. We studied the correlation between the H3K27me3 signal
in the upstream promoter region and the downstream GC content.
Most of the correlations were between 0.13 and 0.17. However, the
correlation for the human ChIP-seq data was as low as 0.008 for
the ‘full’ promoter set and 0.010 for the ‘Conservative’ promoter set
(P-values were 0.26 and 0.57). The results indicate that the genomiC
compositional structures may be related to H3K27me3 modiﬁcation,
but the association was not signiﬁcant for the human ChIP-seq data.

One possible explanation for suCh an association is that the
H3K27m3 signal is higher in exoniC regions than in introniC regions.
Thus, we investigated whether the H3K27me3 signal was different
between the introniC regions and the exoniC regions of promoters.
For the promoters marked with the H3K27me3 modiﬁcation, the
sequence read coverage at the exoniC positions of the promoter
was compared with the sequence read coverage at the introniC
positions of the promoter. There was no signiﬁcant difference of the
H3K27me3 signal between exoniC positions and introniC positions
of promoters (the P-values based on the paired Wilcoxon tests are
>0.05 for both the ‘ﬁill’ and ‘Conservative’ promoter sets). When the
H3K27me3 signal was high at the exoniC positions of a promoter,
the signal at the introniC positions of this promoter was also high (see
Fig. 3 for the ‘ﬁill’ promoter set and Supplementary Fig. 3 for the
‘Conservative’ promoter set). The results indicate that the exon length
of the promoter region is involved in the H3K27me3 modiﬁcation,

Average sequence read coverage at the exonic positions of each promoter

Fig. 3. H3K27me3 signal at exonic positions versus H3k27me3 signal at
intronic positions. For each promoter marked with H3K27me3 modiﬁcation,
we calculated the sequence read coverage for each exonic and intronic
position. The sequence reads were based on the ChIP-seq data for H3K27me3
modiﬁcation in the mouse ES cells, NP cells, MEF cells and brain tissue.
Then the average read coverage for the exonic positions and the average read
coverage for the intronic positions were calculated, respectively, for every
promoter marked with H3K27me3 and shown in the ﬁgure. The straight line
is yzx. The ‘full’ promoter set was used.

but this modiﬁcation on the histone does not distinguish exoniC and
introniC positions.

Genes with multiple alternative promoters may have distinCt
Chromatin status (Mikkelsen e1 (11., 2007). We suspeCted that
alternative promoters distinCtly marked by H3K27me3 might have
different ‘pExon-lengths’. In our study, there were 767 mouse genes
and 1587 human genes with more than one promoter from the ‘full’
promoter sets. These genes had a total of 1631 and 3549 alternative
promoters for mouse and human, respectively. The alternative
promoters marked with H3K27me3 tended to have longer ‘pExon-
length’ than the alternative promoters unmarked with H3K27me3
(the P-values based on the one-sided Wilcoxon tests to compare the
two groups were all <2.6 X 10—5 for mouse and human). Pair-wise
comparison was also conducted. We seleCted the pairs of alternative
promoters that belong to the same gene but with distinCt H3K27me3
signals. For the mouse promoters, we pooled the sequence reads
from three cell lines and brain tissue together. The read counts were
multiplied by a constant to make the total reads equal to 10 million
for eaCh cell line and tissue (a total of 40 million reads for the
pooled sample). For the human promoters, we also multiplied the
read counts by a constant to make the total reads equal to 10 million.
If a pair of mouse alternative promoters had a read-count difference
3200, we called them having distinCt H3K27me3 patterns. If a
pair of human alternative promoters had a read-count difference
:50, we called them having distinCt H3K27me3 patterns. Then

Fig. 4. Examples of the alternative promoters having different exonic

the promoters marked with H3K27me3.

was compared with that of the promoter with lower H3K27me3
reads and belonging to the same gene. The P-value based on the
paired one-sided Wilcoxon test was 0.001 and 0.03 for the mouse
and human promoters, respectively. However, we should note that
the alternative promoter information based on the Refseq annotation
is far from complete.

We show several examples in whiCh genes have alternative
promoters and the ‘pExon-length’ and H3K27me3 signal were
different for these alternative promoters in Figure 4. Speciﬁcally
Figure 4A shows the H3K27me3 signal for Gnas transcript isoforms
in mouse ES cells, NP cells, MEF cells and brain. The promoters
with longer exoniC regions were marked with H3K27me3 in all
four conditions. However, the promoter with shorter exoniC region
was marked with H3K27me3 only in ESCs. Figure 4B shows the
H3K27me3 signal for Runxl transcript isoforms in mouse ES cells,
NP cells, MEF cells and brain. The promoter with longer exoniC
region was marked with H3K27me3 in ES cells and brain. However,
the promoter with shorter exoniC region remained unmarked under
these four conditions.

4 DISCUSSION

Here, we analyzed the relationship between the exoniC positions and
the histone modiﬁcations in gene promoter regions. We found that
although H3K27me3 marks do not distinguish exoniC or introniC
positions, the number of exoniC positions is positively associated
with the H3K27me3 signal. This association is independent of the
H3K4me3 status, nuCleosome occupancy, CpG content and high-
throughput platforms.

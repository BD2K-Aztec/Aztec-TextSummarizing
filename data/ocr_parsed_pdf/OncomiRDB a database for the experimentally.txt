in cancer cell lines, and/or the miRNAs directly target at least
one gene in cancer—related processes validated by luciferase re—
porter assay (when the validation method was not described
clearly, we further checked it within the full text). In the database
content, besides the information of miRNA—regulated cellular
processes and target genes, the miRNA expression patterns,
the miRNA upstream regulators, the cancer types and the cor—
responding experimental conditions were also collected if they
provided in the abstracts. Because of the complexity of cancer
types, the detailed cancer types were grouped into 25 different
cancer tissues: for example, ‘non—small cell lung cancer’, ‘small
cell lung cancer’ and ‘lung adenocarcinoma’ were grouped into
‘lung’ tissue. The latest database release contains 2259 entries
covering more than 300 miRNAs and 829 target genes in 25
cancer tissues. To maintain the data quality, each entry was
double—checked by at least two different curators.

For the latest release of oncomiRDB, breast, liver, colorectum,
lung and stomach are the most annotated cancer tissues; miR—21,
let—7a, miR—34a and miR—145 are the most common oncomiRs
annotated across more than 15 cancer tissues. A few others are
only studied in speciﬁc cancer tissues, such as miR—122 in liver
cancer (specifically expressed in liver tissues) (Chang et al., 2004;
Jopling et al., 2005). The cancer tissues and their related
miRNAs form a complex network. A set of oncogenes such as
CCNDl, IGFlR, CDK6, MET and BCL2 is strongly regulated
by multiple tumor—suppressive miRNAs. These oncogenes are
frequently overexpressed in cancer tissues, consistent with the
global reduction of miRNA expressions (Lu et al., 2005).
Several chromatin modiﬁers, such as EZH2 and BMIl, are
also extensively regulated by several miRNAs, which suggests
that miRNAs play important roles in regulating the chromatin
structure changes during the cancer initiation and progression.

3 USER INTERFACES

To facilitate the database browsing and searching, we built a
Web—based portal providing both graphical and text—based inter—
faces. The graphical interface for the ‘cancer tissueimiRNA’ net—
work is provided on the database main page, while the ‘miRNAi
target’ network can be generated according to any search result.
All the graphical interfaces are developed based on the
Cytoscape Web utility (Lopes et al., 2010).

For the text—based interface, users can specify one or multiple
query conditions in the left navigation column: (i) ‘MicroRNA’:
the users can input the exact miRNA name (such as miR—21) or
add ‘%’ for a fuzzy search (such as miR—200% for miR—200a,
miR—200b and miR—200c); (ii) ‘MiRNA_ID’: the users can select
any interested miRNA with an ofﬁcial symbol; (iii) ‘Tissue’: spe—
cify one of the 25 cancer tissues; (iv) ‘Tumor’: specify any inter—
ested cancer subtype; (v) ‘Target’: specify any interest target
gene; (vi) ‘Function’: specify one of the six most annotated
cancer—related cellular functions. After submitting the query, all
the matched entries will be listed. Then, the users can either
generate the miRNAitarget network or download the detailed
annotations for listed entries. A more detailed user guide can be
found in the Supplementary Material.

4 DISCUSSION

OncomiRDB is a unique resource for annotating the experimen—
tally veriﬁed cancer—related miRNAs with direct functional evi—
dence. By comparing with several existing miRNA target
databases, oncomiRDB can provide many new miRNAitarget
annotations validated by luciferase assay, although it focuses on
collecting cancer—related miRNA targets (the comparison result
is presented in Supplementary Table S1, and the detailed list can
be downloaded from the database Web site). Except for the
direct targets, oncomiRB also collects the corresponding
miRNA cellular functions and experimental conditions from
the literature. The graphical interface, a unique feature of
oncomiRDB, can achieve better database browsing and search
result visualization. In summary, oncomiRDB is a high—conﬁ—
dence reference resource for studying the miRNA—regulated
target genes and cellular processes in cancer.

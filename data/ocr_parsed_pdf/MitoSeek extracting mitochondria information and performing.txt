ABSTRACT

Motivation: Exome capture kits have capture efficiencies that range
from 40 to 60%. A significant amount of off-target reads are from the
mitochondrial genome. These unintentionally sequenced mitochon-
drial reads provide unique opportunities to study the mitochondria
genome.

Results: MitoSeek is an open-source software tool that can reliably
and easily extract mitochondrial genome information from exome and
whole genome sequencing data. MitoSeek evaluates mitochondrial
genome alignment quality, estimates relative mitochondrial copy num-
bers and detects heteroplasmy, somatic mutation and structural vari-
ants of the mitochondrial genome. MitoSeek can be set up to run in
parallel or serial on large exome sequencing datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled high-throughput
production of sequencing data at a low cost. Projects such as The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the 1000 Genomes Project
have generated huge amounts of sequencing data. NGS data are
rich and informative and contain many off-target reads that are
often ignored but which may be biologically relevant. Sequencing
data outside capture regions can produce reliable variation data
(Guo et al., 2012c). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences
are recoverable in exome sequencing data (Larman et al.,
2012), even when the mtDNA is not included in the target
region. Picardi and Pesole (2012) also provided scripts for assem-
bling mitochondrial genome exome sequencing data. Based on
those findings, we designed and implemented a tool, MitoSeek,
for high-throughput secondary mitochondrial data mining from
exome sequencing data or whole genome sequencing data.
MitoSeek extracts mitochondrial information from exome
sequencing data and performs analyses on four major mitochon-
drial factors: heteroplasmy, somatic mutations, relative copy
number variation and large structural changes.

2 METHODS

2.1 Mitochondrial sequence extraction

Compared with the scripts released by Picardi and Pesole (2012), which
extract mtDNA reads and reassemble the mitochondrial genome from
exome sequencing data, MitoSeek can extract mitochondrial genome in-
formation directly from a BAM file and also perform mitochondrial
genome assembly. To deal with mtDNA homologous regions in the nu-
clear genome, MitoSeek uses a conservative approach, which uses reads
unmapped to nuclear genome for the mtDNA assembly. However,
choosing to reassemble the mitochondrial genome requires a signiﬁcantly
longer running time.

2.2 Quality control

Before conducting any analysis, MitoSeek will first produce a mitochon-
drial alignment quality control report, which contains important statistics
such as average depth, percent of base pairs covered, base quality distri-
bution, mapping quality distribution and insert size distribution. These
quality control parameters serve as important conﬁdence indicators for
the downstream mitochondrial analysis. MitoSeek filters reads based on
mapping quality score (MQ 3 20) and base quality score (BQ 3 20). The
threshold of the filters is adjustable by the user.

2.3 Heteroplasmy detection

The most crucial factor for detecting heteroplasmy is depth. The ideal
sequencing technique for detecting heteroplasmy in mitochondria is
mitochondria-targeted sequencing, which is capable of generating
depths of up to 10000 and detecting heteroplasmy as low as 0.1%. The
depth for mtDNA in exome sequencing data is significantly lower, which
limits the detectable heteroplasmy to ~1%. Based on the alignment
quality control report, MitoSeek will automatically adjust the hetero-
plasmy detection threshold to the most appropriate level. The hetero-
plasmy detection threshold is deﬁned on one of two scales: read count
or read percentage at a given location. For example, a user can specify
the number of raw reads that are required to show support for hetero-
plasmy, or the percentage of reads that are required to show support
for heteroplasmy. The heteroplasmy empirical filters follow Guo et al.
(2012a).

In addition to the empirical filters, we implemented a statistical frame-
work to assess heteroplasmy. MitoSeek performs a one-tail Fisher’s exact
test to determine if the rate of heteroplasmy at each site is greater than
zero or a user-deﬁned threshold. Phred quality scores of heteroplasmy are
also reported by MitoSeek.

2.4 Somatic mutation detection

Current genotype callers such as GATK’s Unified Genotyper (McKenna
et al., 2010) and glfMultiple are designed for a diploid genome. Using
those genotype callers on a haploid genome where only a single allele is

expected will generate inaccurate results. To solve this problem, MitoSeek
compares the empirical allele counts between tumor and normal samples
directly instead of using a genotype caller. MitoSeek can extract empirical
allele counts for every mitochondrial position and then compare the allele
counts between tumor and normal to determine somatic mutation status.

2.5 Relative copy number estimation

MtDNA copy number can be obtained through NGS data (Castle et al.,
2010). MitoSeek estimates the relative mtDNA copy number through
exome and whole genome sequencing data. These are not absolute meas-
urements of mtDNA copy number. The method takes advantage of the
proportion of mitochondrial reads captured during exome and whole
genome sequencing. The relative mtDNA copy number is computed as
CN 2 21%;, where Rm is the reads aligned to mitochondria that passed the
quality filter and RT is the total reads that passed the quality filter.
Alternatively, relative mtDNA copy number can be computed as

CN 2 %, where D—m is the average depth of mtDNA, and D—E is the
E

average depth of the exome. If whole genome data are used, E will be
replaced with D—T, where D—T is the average depth across the whole genome
excluding mitochondria.

 

2.6 Structural mtDNA change

MitoSeek also reports mtDNA structural changes when pair-end sequen-
cing data are used. The structural changes include mitochondria-nuclear
genome integration and large deletion in mitochondria. Nuclear genome
integration is a known phenomenon, which has been documented by
multiple studies (Mourier et al., 2001; Timmis et al., 2004), and it can
be detected through discordant read pairs. Large deletion in mtDNA is a
well-studied mtDNA dysfunction (Chen et al., 2011), and MitoSeek de-
tects it through identifying abnormal insert sizes.

2.7 Other features

The most common sequencing alignment reference for the human is
HG19; however, the most accepted mitochondria reference is the revised
Cambridge Reference sequence (rCRS) (Andrews et al., 1999) (GenBank:
NC_012920). MitoSeek can interchange genomic positions and reference
nucleotides between HG19 and rCRS. Annotation of amino acid changes
and identification of known pathogenic mutations are reported by
MitoSeek in both HG19 and rCRS coordinates.

3 RESULT

We downloaded exome sequencing data on 10 normal-paired
breast cancer tumor samples from TCGA and tested MitoSeek
using those data. An example of heteroplasmy identiﬁed by
MitoSeek can be Viewed in Figure 1. An example of a full
report from a MitoSeek run can be seen in the Supplementary
Material. MitoSeek is written in Perl and Linux Shell Script. The
typical run time on exome sequencing data with BAM ﬁle size of
11 GB is ~50 min on a 2.4 GHz CPU with 1 GB of memory.

4 DISCUSSION

Owing to the limitation of exome sequencing data, MitoSeek is
not capable of calculating absolute copy number of mtDNA,
only relative mtDNA copy number. Also, owing to noise in
the sequencing data, MitoSeek is more suited to detecting large
copy number variation rather than small copy number variation.
MitoSeek is designed to work with paired-end sequencing data

rather than single-end sequencing data given the large abundance
of paired-end sequencing data. MitoSeek is designed with acces-
sibility in mind. It considers many unique parameters that have
not been implemented by other genome analysis tools. It is the
only sequencing analysis tool that reports allele counts separately
by forward and reverse strands, critical information for assessing
strand bias (Guo et al., 2012b). MitoSeek creates opportunities
for high-throughput mitochondrial sequencing data mining from
existing large exome sequencing databases.

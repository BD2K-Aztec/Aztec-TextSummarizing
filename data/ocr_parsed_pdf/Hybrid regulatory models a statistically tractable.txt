Hybrid regulatory models

 

benchmark yeast synthetic network IRMA (Cantone et al.,
2009), and the circadian clock of the picoalga Ostreococcus
tauri (Troein et al., 2011). We compare with existing ODE
models, and show that our approach achieves excellent fits and
robust predictions. By comparing predictions on different data
types, our model also provides a new testable hypothesis about
the structure of the 0.tauri clock network.

2 MODEL AND METHODS

Our aim is to obtain plausible, yet statistically tractable, models of the
dynamics of transcriptionitranslation networks. A central requirement is
therefore to include a plausible model of gene expression at the heart of
the framework. In this approach, we use the on/oﬂmodel of gene expres-
sion (Ptashne and Gann, 2002), a simple, yet powerful, model where the
rate of transcription of a gene can vary between two levels depending on
the occupancy of the promoter of the gene. Assuming for simplicity a
tight coupling of transcription and translation, we will use the stronger
assumption that protein production can also happen at two distinct rates
depending on the occupancy of the promoter. Our network models are
therefore composed of a number of connected blocks of two separate
types, each of them representing a protein node and a promoter state.

It is convenient to adopt a graphical notation for the statistical models.
We denote protein states as circles, and promoter states as squares.
Measured protein values are denoted by shaded circles, and we will
always assume measurements to occur at discrete times with i.i.d.
Gaussian noise; promoter states are assumed not to be observed.
Figure 5A shows an example of our graphical representation of a two-
gene network.

2.1 Promoter model

We model promoters as Markovian continuous time random variables
with two possible states, occupied or unoccupied; we denote promoter
states as p, and represent them as telegraph processes. The time marginal
probability p#:1(t) = p1(t) obeys the chemical master equation

 

 

d3?) = #401210) +f+(t)po(t),
mm (1)
d, = —f+(l)170(l)+fi(l)171(l)

where f4r and f, are called switching rates. They represent the transition
probabilities per unit time for the switching of the promoter state from 0
to l and the other way round, respectively. The time marginal probability
p#(t) represents the probability of the promoter state to have a certain
value (either 0 or 1) at a given time t. For example, the marginal prob-
ability p1(t) is the probability for the promoter state to be 1 at time t.

Naturally, the rate at which a promoter becomes occupied depends on
the state (concentration) of upstream proteins which can bind the pro-
moter. Mathematically, we encode this property by enforcing that the
switching rates of the telegraph process iii are functions of the transcrip-
tion factor (TF) concentration X). As f represent probabilities per unit
time, these functions must be always positive. We use a log-linear model
for f if, primarily owing to its mathematical convenience for approximate
inference (see Supplementary Material). On the other hand, the switching
rate fi is set to a positive constant value, reﬂecting the fact that unbind-
ing of the TF (i.e. switch from state 1 to state 0) does not depend on X,-
(Schultz et al., 2007). In formulae we have:

f 2 hp exp (ker) (2)

fi = km (3)

where kw“ are hyperparameters. Notice that this model implies that the
steady-state probability of being bound has a saturating Hill-type

dependence on the concentration of protein X (see Supplementary
Material).

2.2 Protein model

Protein production is modelled as a stochastic on/off model. We use a
continuous approximation to the underlying discrete system and model
the transcriptionalitranslational dynamics through the following stochas-
tic differential equation (SDE):

dXi = (AiMiU) + bi — AiXi)dl + waU) (4)

where subscript i refers to the target gene and its promoter.
Here, 6),» = [Ai,b,»,h,»] is the set of kinetic parameters: A,- represents the
efﬁciency of the promoter in recruiting polymerase when occupied. Its
sign defines the type of regulation: either activation or repression.
Parameter b,- represents a basal transcriptionalitranslational rate and A,»
is the exponential decay constant for X,-, which is inversely proportional to
X,- half-life. Note that Equation (4) is a linear SDE conditioned on the
history of the promoter state, which entails signiﬁcant computational ef-
ﬁciency. However, the time-varying nature of the promoter state allows
plenty of ﬂexibility to capture non-stationary behaviours. The term
adw(t), where w(t) is a Wiener process, represents a white noise-driving
process with non-zero variance :72. This accounts for the presence of
intrinsic noise in the protein concentration X,-, whereas the stochastic
process [14 takes into account the extrinsic noise in gene expression
(Elowitz et al., 2002; Swain et al., 2002).

2.3 Approximate inference

As the model of promoter and proteins is jointly Markovian, exact infer-
ence can be carried out by numerically solving the ChapmaniKolmogorov
forward and backward equations along the lines of Sanguinetti et a]. (2009)
(see Supplementary Material). This, however, requires the numerical solu-
tion of a system of high dimensional partial differential equations, leading
to severe computational problems when parameters need to be estimated
or when more than two genes are present in the network.

We therefore adopt an approximate Bayesian approach for the recon-
struction of promoter states pt, protein states X and the estimation of
model parameters. The quantity we are interested in is the conditional
probability distribution p(p,, le), the joint (posterior) probability of the
state of the promoter p, and the promoter concentration X at all time
points t = t0, . . . , T, conditioned on the observations y. We compute an
approximation to this quantity by minimizing the Kullbac/eLeibler (KL)
divergence functional under a restrictive ansatz for the approximating
process. We give details for a two-gene network: extension to more
genes is straightforward.

The choice of the family of approximating distributions q(p,, X) is often
crucial for computational reasons; here, we use a mean-ﬁeld approxima-
tion (Opper and Saad, 2001). The approximating posterior then factorizes
as follows

4(X20:T,M20:T,X10:T, #101) =

5
qX3(X20:T)qug(M20:T)le(X10:T)qpl(M10:T) ( )

where we are considering a network with two genes, X1 and X2. qx, and q“,
represent pure diffusion processes and pure telegraph processes, respect-
ively. By using this factorized distribution, the KL divergence becomes a
sum of terms that are analytically computable

of the A.thaliana clock (Pokhilko et al., 2012), and indeed with
the structure of known animal circadian clocks (Ukai—Tadenuma
et al., 2011). If validated, this ﬁnding would suggest that the
repressilator structure is an evolutionarily conserved feature of
eukaryotic circadian clocks. Furthermore, our model predicts
that TOCl acts as a repressor (while remaining an indirect acti—
vator of CCA1 through a double repression); again, the repressor
role of TOCl was recently demonstrated in A.thaliana (Gendron
et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2012), leading further weight to our
hypotheses. Although the repressilator model substantially
ameliorates the model misﬁt of the NFL model, there remains
some residual unexplained discrepancy between inferences from
transcriptional and translational reporters. Although this may be
due to noise in the data, it cannot be excluded that the complex—
ity of the 0.tauri oscillator may be even greater, as is the case of
other plant oscillators (Pokhilko et al., 2012).

We believe that these results show the promise of this
approach as an effective tool in addressing systems biology prob—
lems. Nevertheless, this work opens further avenues for develop—
ment. From the biological point of view, validation of the novel
structure of the 0.tauri clock would be an important step, which
is likely to require substantial bioinformatics research. However,
perhaps even more interesting would be to computationally ex—
plore the links between the transcriptionitranslation oscillator
we study and the recently described non—transcriptional oscillator
of 0.tauri (O’Neill et al., 2011). From the computational point of
view, this study does not address the important problem of de
novo reconstruction of the structure of the regulatory network,
but relies on pre—existing network structures. A systematic
method to combine structure learning with dynamical modelling
remains a desirable goal (Oates et al., 2012); we hope that this
work will represent an advance in that promising direction.

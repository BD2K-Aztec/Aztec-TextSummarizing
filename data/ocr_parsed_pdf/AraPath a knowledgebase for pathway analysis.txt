stage at which a gene is expressed (Jaiswal et al, 2005). The
information in P0 was used to derive gene lists. We also collected
sets of genes that are found to be co—expressed in meta—analyses
of expression datasets (Atias et al, 2009; Wilson et al, 2012).
From these seven sources we collected 1909 gene lists (Table 1).

The most challenging part was the extraction of gene lists from
hundreds of published gene expression studies. We examined
1039 datasets in the GEO and 590 in ArrayExpress and were
able to retrieve 783 corresponding papers (52% of the datasets
lacked publication information). After reading the 783 papers,
we found that 397 of them contained 1683 useful sets of differ—
entially expressed genes. Each gene set was annotated with a
unique name and a brief description, accompanied by detailed
information on the source publication. Such information will be
useful in ﬁnding similarities in expression signatures of a user’s
data with those published.

An additional 740 gene sets with less than ﬁve genes were also
collected from the sources mentioned above. All together we
collected 4332 gene sets. These include gene sets similar to all
the categories of MSigDB excluding the Cl: position gene sets.
Besides pathway analysis, the databases of differentially ex—
pressed gene lists also serve as an information source that can
be queried or analyzed. Similar attempts have been made for the
human genome to create databases of reported gene lists (Cahan
et al, 2005; Newman and Weiner, 2005). As lists of affected
genes are often the ﬁnal results of genome—wide studies, the arch—
ival of these results will facilitate the easy access to this accumu—
lated knowledge. Our data can be downloaded or queried at
http: //bioinformatics. sd state. edu/arapath/ .

To demonstrate the utility of the database, we used GSEA to
perform pathway analysis of a dataset (GEO accession number
GSE5534) that measures the response of Arabidopsis seedlings
to cold acclimation (40C for a day). See Supplementary Materials
173 for details. We identiﬁed 12 signiﬁcant GO terms, including
‘Response to cold’, ‘structural constituent of ribosome’, ‘ribo—
some’ and ‘translation’. Proper function of the translation

machinery is necessary at low temperatures, and a previous
genome—wide expression study found the up—regulation of ribo—
somal proteins during cold acclimation (Hannah et al, 2005).
When we ran GSEA with the literature gene sets, we identiﬁed
128 signiﬁcant gene sets, many more than the 12 identified using
GO gene sets. Out of the top 10 up—regulated gene sets, 5 of them
are cold related. This suggests the genomic response to cold in
the new study is similar to these reported in previous studies.
In summary, we have compiled a gene set database for path—
way analysis in Arabidopsis by extracting information from vari—
ous databases of gene functional categories and pathways. It also
includes over a thousand lists of differentially expressed genes
collected from the published genome—wide studies. We will con—
tinue to add to this database and hope this resource will facilitate
various genomics studies and generate novel hypotheses.

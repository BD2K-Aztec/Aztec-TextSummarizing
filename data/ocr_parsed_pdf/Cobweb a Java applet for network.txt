ABSTRACT

Summary: Cobweb is a Java applet for real-time network
visualization; its strength lies in enabling the interactive exploration
of networks. Therefore, it allows new nodes to be interactively added
to a network by querying a database on a server. The network
constantly rearranges to provide the most meaningful topological
view.

Availability: Cobweb is available underthe GPLv3 and may be freely
downloaded at http://bioinformatics.charite.de/cobweb.

1 INTRODUCTION

Network-based techniques are used today to tackle a wide variety of
scientiﬁc questions, ranging from interaction mechanisms in protein
networks to signalling pathway analysis (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004).
Consequently, there is a strong need to have tools to visualize and
explore networks such as Cytoscape (Shannon et (11., 2003), Gephi
(Bastian et al., 2009) and ProViz (Iragne et al., 2005). However,
these programs aim at visualizing large networks and offer many
features. They cannot be integrated into web sites and have a
signiﬁcant learning curve. Therefore, we have developed Cobweb as
a Java applet that has fewer features but can be easily used from any
webpage. Cobweb offers uncomplicated real-time visualization of
networks up to a few hundred nodes. In contrast to earlier web-based
approaches such as Medusa (Hooper and Bork, 2005) and quuid
(Klammer et al., 2008), Cobweb stresses interactive features. Thus,
it is possible to interactively add new nodes to the network at which
time the network topology changes to provide the most uncluttered
View.

2 THE APPLET

Cobweb’s strength lies in its ease of use and ability to be adapted to
new tasks.

2.1 Features

0 Can be easily integrated into web pages.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

0 The user interface is easily customizable using JavaScript
(Section 2.2).

0 The user can interactively load new nodes (e.g. from a database)
(Section 2.3).

0 Network conformation changes for best viewing (Section 2.4).

0 Networks can be input and output as XGMML and GraphML
ﬁles (Section 2.5).

0 Pictorial representation of nodes.

2.2 User interface

The user interface consists of three parts: a network View, a status
bar and a side bar (Fig. l). The network View is the actual applet,
where the network is drawn. Here nodes can be clicked, dragged
and visualization options (like how to depict nodes, the length of
edges, etc.) chosen.

The other parts, the side and status bars, are not part of the applet,
but of the HTML content of the page. The status bar gives some
information about the actions the applet is performing while the
side bar offers possibilities for interacting with the network, e.g. to
add new nodes or to perform basic analyses. The content of these
bars is generated by JavaScript functions, so it is possible to add
additional features to the side bar just by changing the JavaScript
code without touching the applet code.

2.3 Interactiver add nodes

The applet supports interactive exploration of the network displayed
by adding new nodes to the network. Nodes are added either by
double clicking on existing nodes in the network view or through
buttons in the side bar.

To add a new node to the network, the Java applet calls a
script (e.g. written in PHP) that returns detailed information (like
neighbours, description, etc.) about the node. This information is
then parsed by Cobweb and the node is added to the network. If the
script is stored on the same server as the applet, this works without
having to sign the applet.

2.4 Network arrangement

The network is represented internally as a particle system, where
each node in the network is represented by one particle. Each particle
is connected by spring-like forces to all other particles in a pairwise
manner. If two nodes in the network are connected by an edge, the
force between the corresponding particles is attractive, otherwise
repellent. The positions of all particles are constantly recomputed
based on these forces using a fourth-order Runge—Kutta method

bar, the various options to interact with the network are shown as blue buttons. These are context sensitive as they depend on the selected node.

(Press et al., 2007). As such, the network automatically returns to
a favourable position after nodes are added or moved by the user.
Additionally, single nodes can be given a ﬁxed position to improve
clarity.

2.5 Input and output

The applet is able to read and write networks as valid XGMIVIL
(eXtensible Graph Markup and Modeling Language) and GraphML
documents. XGMML and GraphML are widely used ﬁle formats;
this allows users to open the networks using other software, e.g.
Cytoscape and Gephi.

3 CONCLUSIONS

Cobweb is a tool for uncomplicated real-time network Visualization
and particularly suited to interactive exploration of datasets accessed
from web sites. Cobweb is able to open and save documents in
XGMIVIL- and GraphML- format and thus is suited to preliminary
Viewing before loading into more complicated and detailed
analytical software.

We are currently using Cobweb in our project PROMISCUOUS
(von Eichborn et al., 2011); incorporation into other projects is
on—going.

Cobweb is written in Java and based on the Processing framework
(Reas and Fry, 2010) and the G4P library (http://lagers.org.uk/g4p)
by Peter Lager. Being object oriented makes it straightforward to
add new ﬁinctionality (e.g. new node and edge properties) to the
applet.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We want to mention J .T. Bernstein’s physics library from which our
particle system for Cobweb evolved (http://traer.cc/physics).

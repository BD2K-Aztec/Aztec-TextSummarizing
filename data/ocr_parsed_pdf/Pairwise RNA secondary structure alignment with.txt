Abstract

Motivation: The regulatory functions performed by non—coding RNAs are related to their 3D struc—
tures, which are, in turn, determined by their secondary structures. Pairwise secondary structure
alignment gives insight into the functional similarity between a pair of RNA sequences. Numerous
exact or heuristic approaches have been proposed for computational alignment. However, the
alignment becomes intractable when arbitrary pseudoknots are allowed. Also, since non—coding
RNAs are, in general, more conserved in structures than sequences, it is more effective to perform
alignment based on the common structural motifs discovered.

Results: We devised a method to approximate the true conserved stem pattern for a secondary
structure pair, and constructed the alignment from it. Experimental results suggest that our method
identified similar RNA secondary structures better than the existing tools, especially for large struc—
tures. It also successfully indicated the conservation of some pseudoknot features with biological
significance. More importantly, even for large structures with arbitrary pseudoknots, the alignment
can usually be obtained efficiently.

1 Introduction

 

The interest in RNA research was reinvigorated after discovering its
regulatory and catalytic roles in many biological processes (Couzin,
2002; Storz, 2002). Those RNAs with such roles are called the non-
coding RNAs (ncRNAs). They perform a diverse range of functions,
such as regulating gene expression (Serganov and Patel, 2007), mod-
ifying ribosomal RNA (Maden and Hughes, 1997), and controlling
muscle differentiation (Cesana et (11., 2011). It is believed that a spe-
cific function of an ncRNA molecule is related to its structure (Chen
and Chen, 2009; Lee et (11., 1997). Strong evidence is that ncRNAs
are more evolutionarily conserved in their structures than their se-
quences (Reiter et (11., 2011). Therefore, the two main studies in this
area are the structure determination and the comparison among

different structures. The former can be subdivided into experimental
analysis (Scott and Hennig, 2008) and computational prediction
(Rivas and Eddy, 1999; Zuker and Stiegler, 1981) using experimen-
tally determined thermodynamics parameters (Turner and
Mathews, 2010). On the other hand, structure comparison is purely
computational. Moreover, since the structure is critical to the func-
tion, RNA molecules are compared with both structures and con-
stituent base sequences.

In this article, we are interested in the pairwise RNA secondary
structure comparison problem. This problem can be further classified
into the edit problem and the alignment problem (Denise and
Rinaudo, 2014). The edit problem computes the minimum cost (dis-
tance) of modifying a given structure R1 to another given structure R2,

2.2 Progressive stem matching to approximate the true
conserved stem pattern

On the other hand, the best conserved stem pattern defined above
might be different from the true conserved stem pattern, because the
edit distance of the stem pattern excludes the unpaired base regions
(e.g. hairpin loops) that are also deterministic in structure alignment.
Also, ECGM is in general NP—complete (Bunke, 1997). While an
exact algorithm is scalable with some RNA families, for large RNA
molecules, such as 165 and 23S ribosomal RNAs, the number of
base pair stems and the stem graph order might exceed 100. An ex—
haustive search becomes intractable for such a graph order. It is then
necessary to reduce the search space by selecting mapped vertex
pairs that are more probable to appear in the ECGM representing
the true pattern. We introduce a heuristics called progressive stem
matching. It identifies similar nesting motifs and then non—nesting
motifs in both input structures, and computes the mcECGM from
these results afterwards. This mcECGM models the approximate
true conserved stem pattern. The core algorithms for each of its
phases are stated below. An example illustrating these phases is pro—
vided in the supplementary material.

2.2.1 Phase 1: Initialization

We adapt the definitions of stack and stem proposed in (deland,
2006), where a base pair stem consists of one or more base pair
stacks joined by bulges or internal loops. Given a secondary struc—
ture, this phase first merges some of its nested stacks into stems (the
merging mechanism is described in the supplementary material), and
then generates its stem graph G : (V, E, l, 17). By determining
whether its underlying stem is nesting for every vertex, V is parti—
tioned into Vnest and menest such that a stem represented by U in
Vnest is nesting; otherwise U is in Vnmmst. A vertex in Vnest is a nest—
ing vertex, and a vertex in Vnormest is a non—nesting vertex. V’ of an—
other structure is partitioned into V’nest and V’nonmst.

2.2.2 Phase 2: Identifying highly similar non-nesting motifs

The underlying stem for a vertex in menest or V’normest forms a
non—nesting motif, which consists of the stem itself and the loop seg—
ment enclosed by it. The green boxes of Supplementary Figure 53A
provide some examples. We identify highly similar non—nesting
motifs in both structures, and then generate the mapped vertex pairs
accordingly. These pairs are utilized to search similar nesting motifs
in phase 3. The algorithm appended at the end of this sub—section is
described as follows: The motif alignment cost ratio r), for every pos—
sible non—nesting motif alignment pair (line 1) is first calculated,
where r), is defined as:

,, dormer/awry»)
W”) ‘ minor/army». "Lark/(prod). m}

a is the alignment function returning the cost, 10 and 10’ extract non—
nesting motifs bounded by the stem obtained from p(v) and p’(v’) re—

(1)

spectively. 11 is a null motif. 7;, is the alignment cost averaged by the
lower motif removal cost. For each non—nesting motif in both struc—
tures, its lowest 7;, value (indicating best alignment) is kept as rbimin
(lines 2 — 3). Its best and suboptimal aligned counterparts are added
to L (line 4) such that their 7;. values are at most 7' times of rbimin. So,
7' controls the selection of the best and suboptimal aligned counter—
parts into L. mcECGMs are computed from L to remove outliers.
For efficiency reasons, mcECGMs are obtained progressively with a
selection range b: (bstam bend]. b first selects highly similar motif
pairs in L (lines 5 — 6) to build initial partial mcECGMs. Those with
at least u pairs are kept (line 6), and u is the minimum size

requirement of the initial mcECGMs for robust expansion to the
final mcECGMs. When at least one qualified initial mcECGM is
found, b is shifted to the next range of width A (line 7) to select the
next less similar pairs in L for iterative expansion (line 10).
Otherwise, bend is incremented by the step size A (line 7) to repeat
the initial mcECGM finding (line 8). The one with the most vertex
pairs in the final mcECGMs is reported as 711),. The vertex edit oper—
ation costs in this phase are motif based, i.e. 6,501, U’):a(h(p(v)),
101171101), cm(v)=a(h(17(v)), n) and CuL(v’)=a(/0’(P’(v’)), 11), and the
edge edit operation costs are identical to Section 2.1. When a non—
nesting stem is crossing, the other stems with which it crosses are
not considered during its motif alignment.

2.2.3 Phase 3: Obtaining partial mcECGMs by identifying similar
nesting motifs

The underlying stem for a vertex in Vnest or V’nest forms a nesting
motif, which consists of the stem itself, and any other motifs and
loops nested in it. The red box of Supplementary Figure 53A shows
an example. This phase starts building mcECGMs from Vnest and
V’nest by identifying similar nesting motifs. However, such motifs
are sometimes large, and nested pseudoknots may also be present,
hence it is inefficient to align such motifs. Alternatively, a structure
profile Q(U) (Q(U’)) is created for each U in Vnest (U’ in V’nest) to esti—
mate motif similarity using mb obtained in phase 2. The first set in
Q(U), N(U), represents non—nesting stems nested in the underlying
stem 5 of U. The second set CPV(U) represents non—nesting stems cross—
ing s (i.e. they precede s in 5’ to 3’ direction), and the last set C5q(v)
represents non—nesting stems crossed by s (i.e. s precedes them) (line
1). A match score and a mismatch score are evaluated for every nest—
ing motif pair. The match score zmatchw, U’) is the number of
mapped vertex pairs (14, u’) in 77117 such that the structural relation
(limited to the three relations defined in Q(U)) between 14 and U is
identical to that between 14’ and 1” (line 4). This score indicates how
many non—nesting motifs in the profiles are conserved between the
two nesting motifs. On the other hand, a mismatch between U and 1”
occurs when a non—nesting vertex u (or u’ ) appearing in a set of Q(U)
(or Q(U’)) belongs to a mapped pair (14, u’) in 711)., but u’ (or u) is not

2.3 Alignment function, non—bijective stem matching,
and overall structure alignment generation

Motif alignment (i.e. a(/a(p(v)), la’(p’(v’))) is used for vertex mapping
between anmst and V’rmrknest (phases 2 and 4), while stem align—
ment (i.e. a(p(v), p’(v’))) is used when the vertex mapping involves
those representing nesting stems (phases 3 and 5). The difference is
that the former aligns single segments from the two structures while
the latter aligns a pair of stem upstream and downstream regions.
For a nesting stem, its upstream and downstream regions are disjoint
in the structure. Our alignment function a is capable of performing
these two types of alignment. Interested readers may refer to the
supplementary material for details.

It is possible for a stem in a structure to be matched with more
than one stem in another structure. For example, if the hydrogen
bonds in several contiguous base pairs in the middle of a long helix
are broken, the helix becomes two helices connected by an internal
loop. Meanwhile, mcECGM is a bijective mapping and has to be ex—
tended to model such non—bijective stem matching. This process and
the secondary structure alignment generation from the extended
mcECGM are described in the supplementary material.

3 Results

3.1 Experimental setup

We implemented our approach in a tool called PSMAlign using Perl,
and its alignment function is modified from rna_align (Jiang et al.,
2002) in C++. Two experiments were performed. The first experi—
ment compared the performance of PSMAlign with other structure
alignment tools in identifying similar structures. The second com—
pared PSMAlign with the Needleman—Wunsch sequence alignment
(Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) for aligning pseudoknotted struc—
tures. Pairwise alignment results involving pseudoknots in at least
one of the input structures are also presented. The default parameter
values for PSMAlign are as follows: For phase 2, u:5, initial
bsmt : —1, initial bend : 0.1, A : 0.05 and f: 2. For phase 3, K: 1.
Various costs used by its alignment function are: wb : 1.5,
wbm : 0.5, wr : 2, wa : 1.75, wd: 1 and wm : 1. Both experiments
were performed on an Intel Core2 Duo 3.0 GHz machine with 4GB
of RAM running 64—bit Ubuntu 12.04.

3.2 Experiment 1: BRASERO benchmarks using SRP
and 16S ribosomal RNA families

BRASERO (Allali et al., 2012) evaluates the performance of various
secondary structure alignment tools in identifying similar structures.
Each of its testing datasets consists of a reference structure set Rref
from an RNA family, and a sequence set S. S contains a positive class

of various sequences in the same family as but not in Rref, and a nega—
tive class of some noise sequences with similar length distribution as
Rref. For each sequence 5 in S, its optimal and suboptimal secondary
structures are obtained using tools such as mfold (Markham and
Zuker, 2005). Each of the predicted structures is aligned with every
structure in Rref using the alignment tool examined. The best similar—
ity score (or alignment cost depending on the tool) achieved is the
score of 5. All sequences in S are then sorted by their scores.
Afterwards, every sequence can be classified as positive (structurally
similar to those in Rref) or negative (structurally dissimilar) according
to a threshold. From the classification result, the proportion of cor—
rectly classified sequences in the positive class is the true positive rate
(TPR); and the proportion of incorrectly classified sequences in the
negative class is the false positive rate (FPR). A receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve for this alignment tool is a plot of TPR
versus FPR obtained by varying the threshold, and the area under the
ROC curve (AUC) illustrates the average performance of the tool
(Fawcett, 2006). A higher AUC means it is more likely to give higher
similarity scores or lower alignment costs to similar structures than to
dissimilar structures, and hence a better performance. The maximum
AUC is 1.

PSMAlign was benchmarked with Gardenia (Blin et 41., 2010),
MiGaL (Allali and Sagot, 2008) and RNAForester (Hochsmann et al.,
2003, 2004), which are standalone secondary structure alignment
tools publicly available. The signal recognition particle (SRP) and the
16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) datasets were selected for benchmarks
due to their significantly long sequence lengths (>300 nucleotides).
Figure 3 shows that PSMAlign exhibited the highest AUC in both SRP
and 16S rRNA datasets, which are 0.764 and 0.931, respectively.
Moreover, at a very low FPR (<0.01), it achieved a significantly
higher TPR of 0.6 in the SRP dataset and 0.675 in the 16S rRNA
dataset. This suggests that 60% of the positive class sequences in the
SRP dataset, and 67.5% of those in the 16S rRNA dataset, are struc—
turally more similar to the reference structures than over 99% of the
noise sequences. An interesting observation is the performance com—
parison between exact approach and heuristics in different datasets.
Both Gardenia and RNAForester are exact approaches, while MiGaL
and PSMAlign are heuristics assuming better conservation in structure
than in sequence. They construct alignment according to the similar
local motifs identified. In the 16S rRNA dataset, the ROCs of the
heuristic approaches are well above that of the exact methods, mean—
ing that the proposition holds. On the other hand, in the SRP dataset,
the ROC of PSMAlign falls below the ROCs of the exact methods in
its middle segment. A small segment is even under the diagonal
(denoting the ideal ROC of random guess), meaning that at some
thresholds, TPR<FPR. MiGaL performed even worse in that its
ROC is well below the ROCs of the exact methods, and below the di—
agonal for a large segment. We believe that some positive class in—
stances were more conserved in their sequences than in their
structures. Heuristics performed worse than exact methods when the
proposition did not hold for some molecules. This is supported by the
even worse performance in MiGaL which also takes this proposition.
The abstract properties, such as the number of helices or base pairs,
utilized at its first three levels of structure comparison limited its pre—
cision in this dataset.

3.3 Experimental 2: Structural alignments involving
pseudoknots

On the other hand, only PSMAlign is able to align pseudoknotted
RNA secondary structures. Also, since the sequence folding tools in
BRASERO do not predict pseudoknots, pseudoknotted structures

of the nesting stems of the largest multi—loop in both structures are
indicated by the black boxes in the figure. The highly conserved
base sequences and base pairs strongly suggest that they are
matched. This also shows that the best conserved stem pattern might
not be the true conversed stem pattern. More importantly, exact
structure alignment cannot reveal this conservation due to the non—
minimum alignment cost. Supplementary Figure SSA—D in the sup-
plementary material highlight the approximate true conserved stem
pattern between the 23S ribosomal RNAs in Chlamydomonas rein-
hardtii (molecule Id: CRW_00520) and in Deinococcus radiodumns
(molecule Id: PDB_00993). This pattern is very close to the true pat—
tern since only a few stems are left unmatched. The overall align—
ment is shown in Supplementary Figure S9.

4 Discussion

Our progressive stem matching heuristics is similar to RNAStrAT
(Guignon et al., 2005), since both decompose the input structures
into stems, and construct a conserved stem pattern based on the
stem alignment results. The major difference between them is that
our heuristics applies mcECGM for pattern finding, while
RNAStrAT utilizes dynamic programming and therefore does not
allow pseudoknots in the input structures. Moreover, it only com—
pares the similarity between the nesting stems without considering
the similarities among other stems nested in them. Progressive stem
matching employs a structure profile to also compare the nested
components as well as aligning the nesting stem themselves.

Although the experiment results suggest that true conserved stem
pattern approximation works well for pairwise RNA secondary
structure alignment, PSMAlign still retains the exact mcECGM algo—
rithm finding the best conserved stem pattern. The reason is that
there might not be enough highly similar non—nesting motif pairs
(<u) at phase 2. Reducing the value of u appears to be a possible
solution, however the results become trivial when u is set to just 1
or 2. When no result is found for the current u value, it turns to dis—
cover the mcECGMs for the best conserved pattern, and users can
also specify which stem pattern to use for alignment.

An interesting observation from the first experiment is that the
average performance of PSMAlign in the SRP dataset is better than
Gardenia and RNAForester, both of which are exact secondary struc—
ture alignment approaches. In the 16S rRNA dataset, both PSMAlign
and MiGaL performed substantially better than the exact methods.
The conclusion is that heuristics aligning RNA secondary structures
by detecting similar structural motifs outperform exact approaches
computing lowest cost global alignments. This is supported by our
finding in experiment 2, in which the approximate true conserved
stem pattern could result in a biologically more significant alignment
despite its non—minimum alignment cost. This verifies that ncRNAs
are, in general, more conserved in structures than in sequences.
Because an alignment with the lowest edit distance or highest similar—
ity score does not guarantee all important biological features to be
aligned, it is therefore necessary to discuss the meaning of “optimal”
secondary structure alignment, such as proposing new measures to
quantify the pairwise similarity between the structures, or what types
of base pair stacks or stems should be matched with a higher priority.

mcECGM is effective in approximating a true conserved stem
pattern with arbitrary crossing stems. The pattern shown in
Supplementary Figure SSA—D suggests that all the conserved cross—
ing stems are matched correctly, no matter how complicated the
underlying pseudoknots are. As the stem graph models the stem
crossing relations with its edges, conserved crossing stems are able

to be revealed by mcECGM. Meanwhile, it relies on a carefully de—
signed candidate pruning scheme to reduce the computation time.

Local alignment is also very important because many RNA sec—
ondary structures are only conserved in some of their structural
motifs. Progressive stem matching adopts a local then global style to
first search for highly similar non—nesting motifs such as hairpins.
These similar motif pairs are sorted according to their similarity
measures (r;7 in phase 2), and those with better values are more prob—
able to be retained in the reference information (77117 in phase 2) for
the next phase matching nesting stems. A pair of nesting stems is
only shortlisted for alignment when both stems nest certain non—
nesting motifs that are regarded as similar, according to the refer—
ence information. As a result, the more similar the local nesting and
non—nesting motifs, the more likely they can be identified. The true
conserved stem pattern is then approximated from these identified
motif pairs. Supplementary Figure SlOA—C shows the approximate
true conserved stem pattern between the 23S ribosomal RNAs in
Caenorhabditis elegans (molecule Id: CRW_00533) and Suillus
sinuspaulianus (molecule Id: CRW_00544). Although both mol—
ecules differ significantly in length, three possible conserved local
structural motifs (indicated by the red boxes) were identified from
the pattern.

The major limitation of PSMAlign is the imperfect overall align—
ment due to separate alignments of the stem regions and the se—
quence regions. Precautionary measures were devised to detect some
cases of cross—region alignments, but there are still some complicated
situations, such as the one shown in the green box of Supplementary
Figure S9. The vertical line illustrates the boundary of the aligned se—
quence region (left) and aligned the stem region (right). The ‘GCG’
segments of both structures should be aligned instead of aligning the
single base pair, but the detection approach proposed is unable to
detect this, because the gap is not an edge gap. This is caused by the
base pair shifting from the right G nucleotide in the first structure to
the left G nucleotide in the second structure, and we call it ‘base pair
shift’. We are currently working towards new measures to mitigate
these limitations.

5 Conclusion

We have demonstrated the ability of the conserved stem pattern in
performing pairwise alignment between RNA secondary structures.
It serves as a heuristics to align structures with relatively higher ac—
curacy. It enables biologists to perform computational structure
alignment that could not be done previously, such as aligning those
consisting of arbitrary pseudoknots. Sample alignments revealed
some highly conserved structural features, which can be further
investigated for a better understanding of their biological
significance.

ABSTRACT

Summary: RNA interference (RNAi) is known to play an important part
in defence against viruses in a range of species. Second-generation
sequencing technologies allow us to assay these systems and the
small RNAs that play a key role with unprecedented depth.
However, scientists need access to tools that can condense, analyse
and display the resulting data. Here, we present viRome, a package
for R that takes aligned sequence data and produces a range of
essential plots and reports.

Availability and implementation: viRome is released under the BSD
license as a package for R available for both Windows and Linux
http://virome.sf.net. Additional information and a tutorial is avail-
able on the ARK-Genomics website: http://www.ark-genomics.org/
bioinformatics/virome.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNA interference (RNAi) is mediated by small RNAs, such as
micoRNAs (miRNAs) of 2172 nt (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2001),
small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of 2172 nt (Bernstein et al.,
2001; Zamore et al., 2000) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs)
of 2L30 nt (Aravin et al., 2003; Brennecke et al., 2007), and these
molecules regulate many biological processes. These pathways are
also a major part of the antiviral response in both insects and
plants, including a variety of important mosquito-borne diseases
of humans and animals, such as West Nile Virus, Dengue Virus
and Chikungunya Virus. In arthropods, these are characterized
by the production of 2172 nt Virus-derived small interfering
RNAs (ViRNAs) or 24e30 nt Viral piRNA-like molecules (Blair,
2011; Donald et al., 2012; Myles et al., 2009).

Second-generation sequencing allows scientists to assay these
systems in unprecedented depth, and short reads capture both
the 2172 nt siRNAs and the 24e30 nt piRNAs. However, there
is a need for scientists to be able to summarize, analyse and
Visualize the results of such experiments. Here, we present
viRome, a package for R, which takes aligned sequencing data
in the BAM format (Li et al., 2009) and produces a variety of
plots and reports that are essential to the analysis of data from
Viral siRNA datasets.

Software packages to analyse Viral siRNA data exist.
Paparrazi (V odovar et al., 2011) is designed to reconstruct Viral
genomes from siRNA data and produces some similar plots to
viRome. Alternatively, Visitor (Antoniewski, 2011), an infor-
matic pipeline for analysing short-read ViRNA data, also pro-
duces several similar plots. However, both are implemented in
Perl and are limited to the Linux/Unix operating system; they
include alignment as part of the analysis; therefore, using an
alternative aligner would require programming skills; ﬁnally,
the plots are generated in batch mode; hence, there is no inter-
action between the user and the software.

As a package for R, viRome improves on these software pack-
ages in several ways, including (i) viRome allows interaction be-
tween the user and the software during report and graph
generation, (ii) viRome is available on any operating system
that supports R and has been tested on Microsoft Windows
and several Linux distributions, (iii) viRome separates Visualiza-
tion from alignment; therefore, the user is free to use any align-
ment software they wish and (iv) as an R package, viRome
integrates seamlessly with other R packages from the
Bioconductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004).

2 ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION

As input, viRome takes aligned sequence data in the BAM for-
mat. Many tools exist for alignment (Fonseca et al., 2012) and
provided they support the SAM/BAM format, viRome is cap-
able of working with their output. Many of the functions within
viRome attempt to summarize millions of data points into tables
and plots that allow biological interpretation. One of the beneﬁts
of viRome is that most functions return the summarized data, as
well as creating a plot. This allows users to create their own plots
if they wish. Figure 1 shows a selection of plots produced by
viRome.

Global analyses: One of the ﬁrst requirements is to plot a
histogram of the lengths of mapped readsia peak at 2172 nt
implying an siRNA response, and a high frequency of 24e30 nt
with a peak at 28 a piRNA response. In viRome, this can be
created using the barplotbam function. Users may also create
a report using the sequence.rep0rt function. This produces a
data.frame in R that summarizes and counts the sequences
aligned to each base in a given reference sequence. Users can
see the exact sequence, its length, the location and strand of
the alignment plus a count of how many times that sequence

sequence logo showing T1 bias; heatmap and sequence logo showing A10 bias; barplot showing T1 bias; 5’ read distance plot for 2&29 nt reads showing
enrichment of 10 nt overlap; and a heatmap showing the genomic location of 1&36 bp reads (counts per position: black is low, red is high)

occurs. As a data.frame, this can be easily exported to Excel or
other spreadsheet software.

Location-based analyses: Although many Viruses are targeted
by the siRNA pathway throughout the genome, others are tar-
geted only in limited regions (Sabin et al, 2013). A heatmap
representing the occurrence of all mapped read lengths
across all genomic locations can be produced using the
size.position.heatmap function, and barplots showing counts for
each genomic location for each read length generated using the
stackedbarplot function.

Read-based analyses: Read-based analyses allow users to focus
on patterns in particular subsets of reads. Single barplots show-
ing the location, strand and count of reads mapping through-
out the genome can be Visualized using the position.barplot
function. The base composition of subsets of reads can be calcu-
lated with the makepwm function. Sequence signatures of the
piRNA pathway include a strong U1 bias in primary, antisense
piRNAs and following ‘ping-pong’ cycle ampliﬁcation involving
AGO3 and Aub, a strong A10 bias in secondary sense piRNAs in
Drosophila (Brennecke et al, 2007). Similar motifs have been
found in piRNAs and Viral piRNA-like molecules in mosquitoes
or derived cell lines (Morazzani et al, 2012; Schnettler et al,
2013; Vodovar et al, 2012). The output of makepwm can be
plotted as a heatmap using the pwmlteatmap function, or used
with external packages such as seqLogo and motifStack to pro-
duce sequence logos. Finally, the 5’-ends of complementary
piRNAs are most frequently separated by 10nt (Brennecke
et al, 2007; Vodovar et al, 2012) because of the earlier described
‘ping-pong’ ampliﬁcation. The distance between 5/-ends of
piRNAs mapping to opposite strands can be summarized and
Visualized using the read.dist.plot function.

3 CONCLUﬁONS

Deep sequencing experiments have revealed a variety of interest-
ing and unique signatures of the miRNA, siRNA and piRNA
pathways, and there is a need for software that allows scientists
to process such data. We have developed viRome, a package for
R that allows the interactive generation of a range of informative
plots and reports. As an R package, viRome is available on
a range of operating systems. viRome is released under an

open-source license and can be downloaded from http://
Virome.sf.net, where a tutorial is also available.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: For a diallelic marker locus, the transmission
disequilibrium test (TDT) is a simple and powerful design for genetic
studies. The TDT was originally proposed for use in families with both
parents available (complete nuclear families) and has further been
extended to 1-TDT for use in families with only one of the parents
available (incomplete nuclear families). Currently, the increasing
interest of the influence of parental imprinting on heritability indicates
the importance of incorporating imprinting effects into the mapping
of association variants.

Results: In this article, we extend the TDT-type statistics to
incorporate imprinting effects and develop a series of new test
statistics in a general two-stage framework for association studies.
Our test statistics enjoy the nature of family-based designs that need
no assumption of Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium. Also, the proposed
methods accommodate complete and incomplete nuclear families
with one or more affected children. In the simulation study, we verify
the validity of the proposed test statistics under various scenarios,
and compare the powers of the proposed statistics with some
existing test statistics. It is shown that our methods greatly improve
the power for detecting association in the presence of imprinting
effects. We further demonstrate the advantage of our methods by the
application of the proposed test statistics to a rheumatoid arthritis
dataset.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genetic imprinting, as an example of epigenetic factors, occurs
when certain genes increase levels of expression through inheritance
from one of the parental Chromosomes (Pfeifer, 2000; Reik
and Walter, 2001). Morison et (11. (2001) have constructed an
imprinted gene database and >1% of all mammalian genes
are believed to show imprinting effects (http://igc.otago.ac.nz).
Abnormal expressions of imprinted genes result in numerous human
genetic disorders, including Prader—Willi, Beckwith—Wiedemann
and Angleman syndromes (Falls et (11., 1999). When the candidate

gene of a disease under study is a marker allele per se or is in linkage
disequilibrium (LD) with a marker allele, the parental-asymmetric
test (PAT) was proposed and extended to examine imprinting effects
in the absence of maternal effects using complete nuclear families
(nuclear families with both parents) with one or multiple affected
Children (Weinberg, 1999; Zhou et (11., 2009). In the case of missing
genotypes among parents, l-PAT was proposed for incomplete
nuclear families (nuclear families with a single parent) with an
arbitrary number of affected Children (Zhou et (11., 2009). Based
on a mixture of complete and incomplete nuclear families, C-PAT,
a combination of PAT and 1-PAT, was suggested to increase the
test power (Zhou et (11., 2009). Other methods for the detection of
imprinting effects were generally derived in the framework of log-
linear model, leading to the likelihood ratio tests (Weinberg et (11.,
1998).

When the genes are imprinted, the performance of gene
mapping would be affected. As a result, studies on incorporating
imprinting effects into genetic linkage or association analysis have
arisen the interest of researchers (Hu et (11., 2007a; Shi et (11.,
2007; Strauch et (11., 2000; Weinberg et (11., 1998; Wu et (11.,
2005). Among the approaches, a test statistic termed TDTI (Hu
et (11., 2007a) was constructed based on the extensions of the
transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) (Spielman et (11., 1993) and
was shown to be more powerful than the conventional TDT in the
presence of imprinting effects. The TDTI ﬁrst employs a parent-of-
origin effects test statistic (POET) to test for imprinting effects and
then Chooses the most appropriate statistic from a set of TDT-type
statistics, which are TDT suitable for no imprinting effects, TDTp
(the paternal version of TDT) for maternal imprinting, and TDTm
(the maternal version of TDT) for paternal imprinting, to test
for association. Note that the TDTI only accommodates complete
nuclear families and thus is not suitable for incomplete families.
l-TDTI (Hu et (11., 2007b), which is essentially the T2 of the 1-TDT
(Sun et (11., 1999) tests, is a valid linkage/association test in the
presence of imprinting effects for incomplete nuclear families.

On the other hand, genetic association analysis works over short
distance in genome and provides ﬁne mapping of genetic loci
detected by linkage (Cordell and Clayton, 2005). In this article,
we aim to develop a Class of test statistics to test for association
incorporating imprinting effects in the presence of linkage. First,
we propose a test statistic, termed TDTI*, for use in complete
nuclear families. Like TDTI, TDTI* is also derived under a two-
stage process, where we employ a more powerful test PAT instead
of POET in the ﬁrst stage to test if there is paternal, maternal or

no imprinting effects at a marker of interest, and we then test for
association in the second stage by selecting an appropriate statistic
according to the ﬁndings of the imprinting test. Next, we propose the
1-TDTp (the paternal version of 1-TDT) and 1-TDTm (the maternal
version of 1-TDT) for incomplete nuclear families. By applying the
l-PAT for detecting imprinting effects in the ﬁrst stage, we select
an appropriate test statistic among 1-TDT, 1-TDTp and 1-TDTm
to test for association in the second stage based on the ﬁndings of
the 1-PAT. Thus, a test statistic 1-TDTI* is developed for use in
incomplete nuclear families. Further, combining complete nuclear
families with incomplete nuclear families, the C-TDTI* is suggested
to efﬁciently utilize the information in a dataet. TDTI*, 1-TDTI* and
C-TDTI* are expressed in general forms, which enable a ﬂexible use
of the statistics in practice to accommodate families with arbitrary
numbers of Children. We investigate the validity and the performance
of the proposed set of statistics by simulation, and apply C-TDTI*
to the genome-wide association study of rheumatoid arthritis.

2 METHODS

2.1 Background and notations

Consider a marker locus (ML) with two alleles M1 and M2, and a disease
susceptibility locus (DSL) under study with disease allele D and normal
allele [1. Let F, M and  denote the numbers of M1, carried by the father,
mother and affected child j of a nuclear family, respectively. Let $07,),
¢d/D, $0M and ¢D/D denote the penetrance of the ordered genotypes d/d,
d/D, D/a1 and D/D at the DSL, respectively, of which the left allele of the
slash in each genotype is assumed to be inherited from the father and the
right one is from the mother. When the Mendel’s law holds, $070 =¢D/d;
otherwise, there may exist parent-of—origin effects at the DSL. The degree of
imprinting effects is introduced as I=(¢D/d —¢d/D)/2, where I <0 (I> 0)
signiﬁes paternal (maternal) imprinting and I :0 implies that risks for the
two heterozygous DSL genotypes are identical, i.e. no imprinting effects
(Strauch at 611., 2000).

As in earlier work (Hu at 611., 2007a; Weinberg, 1999), mating symmetry
in the parental generation is assumed throughout this article, that is,
Pr(F=f,M=m)=Pr(F=m,M=f) for allf,m=0, 1,2. We further assume
that there are no maternal effects and the target allele M1 is in positive LD
with the disease if there exists association.

2.2 Test statistic when both parents are available

We begin by constructing TDTI*, where we ﬁrst consider that there are nc
complete nuclear families and 1(1) affected children in family i, i = 1, . . . , nc.
Let every child be matched with the parents, and the resulting trio is termed
as case-parents trio. A set of difference statistics is then deﬁned based on
each case-parents trio, through which PAT, TDT, TDTp and TDTm are
similarly expressed. For example, the difference statistics for PAT and TDT
are respectively listed as below,
Slij =1F,~>M,~,C,~f:l—IFi<Mi,Cif:lw
.vgzﬂj—Nﬂj, 1:1,...nc;j=1,...,1(i),

where I { comparison Statement} is 1 when the comparison statement holds
and is 0 otherwise, and Ti]- and NT)!- denote the numbers of M1 being
transmitted and not being transmitted from the heterozygous parents in
each case-parents trio, respectively. Under the null hypothesis of the PAT
test, which is no imprinting effects at the DSL or no association between
the marker allele and disease gene, sh]- has a zero mean. Under the null
hypothesis of TDT test, which has no association between the marker allele
and the disease gene or no linkage between the ML and DSL, sij has
a zero mean. Further, by summing over all the case-parents trios, deﬁne
s1 = 2'” 11.2 sh]- and s = 1 211.81 sij, and the PAT and TDT can then be

i:l

expressed as follows,
Y] S

PAT=‘—, TDT=—,

where @(w) and @(s) are the corresponding unbiased estimates of
the variances of s, and s under the null hypotheses of the PAT and the
TDT tests, respectively. @(sl) 2 Zi(ZJ-slzlj + 2Zk<js1ijs1ik) and @(s) =
Zi(ZJ-slzj+2zk<jsijsik). TDTp and TDTm could be similarly expressed
from the corresponding difference statistics .v],ij=T},ij—NT},U and Smij:
T,,,ij—NT},,iJ-, where 7},”- (Tmij) and NE,”- (NTmij), respectively, denote the
numbers of allele M1 being transmitted and not being transmitted from the
heterozygous father (mother) in family i to his (her) child j. With the available
statistics, the test statistic TDTI* is formulated as

TDTI>1< = TDTm I{pAT<—Zal /2}

+TDT1{ ‘pATl Elm Pl

+TDTI;,I{PA_1,>Z[Xl ﬂ }.
where 011 is the pre-speciﬁed signiﬁcance level in testing for imprinting
effects, and zal /2 is the upper 011/2 quantile of a standard normal
distribution. TDTI* illustrates that when the imprinting effect is signiﬁcant
enough, TDTm or TDTp is accordingly chosen to be the test statistic,
otherwise TDT will be used for the following stage of association test.
Note that the paper of TDTI (Hu at 611., 2007a) has theoretically compared
the powers of TDTm, TDTp and TDT and found TDTm (TDTp) is more
powerful than TDT when there exists paternal (maternal) imprinting effect.
When there is no association, PAT and the three TDT-type statistics
asymptotically follow N (0, 1), but are not independent. The joint distribution
of PAT and TDTm/TDT/TDTp is bivariate normal with mean vector being
zero. Therefore, to ﬁnd the asymptotic null distribution and P-value of the
proposed test TDTI*, the covariance matrices between the two test statistics
in the ﬁrst and second stages need deriving. As an example, we have the
estimate of the covariance between PAT and TDT as

@(sbs)

«ﬁrst/ﬁat

where ﬁn“):Zizjzksws,k, and is the unbiased estimate of the
covariance between s1 and s under the null hypothesis of no association
(Supplementary Materials). The estimates of the covariances between PAT
and TDTm and between PAT and TDTp can be similarly derived and are
omitted for brevity in this article. Finally, let the estimated values of PAT in
the ﬁrst stage and the selected TDT-type test statistic in the second stage for
the TDTI* be t] and [2, then

Pr (TDTI* 5 12)

670mm, TDT) =

Pr(PAT< —Zal/2,TDTm S [2),if [1 < —Zal/2
= Pr(IPATISZaI/szDTSlz),if |11|SZa1/2
Pr(PAT> zal/2,TDTp 5 12), if 11> Z411 /2

(see Supplementary Materials for the computation of P-Value of TDTI").
It is worth noting that under the assumption of M1 in positive LD with D,
a negative (positive) value of PAT indicates that the disease is paternally
(maternally) imprinted. On the contrary, when the target allele M1 is
in negative LD with the disease allele, a negative (positive) value of
PAT represents maternal (paternal) imprinting effect. However, the TDTI*
remains unchanged under the two situations (Supplementary Materials), so
our method is practical in real data analysis irrespective of the positive or
negative LD between the target allele and the disease allele.

2.3 Test statistic when only one parent is available

We continue to construct 1-TDTI*, where the notations involved with
incomplete nuclear families are as follows. Suppose there are n, incomplete

nuclear families, among which we have nM single-mother families and np
single-father families. For each incomplete nuclear family, let every child
be paired with the available parent and the resulting pair is termed as
case-parent pair. The test statistic 1-TDT, consisting of T1 and T2 , was
proposed by Sun et a1. (1999) to test for association/linkage based on case-
parent pairs. For assoctaion study, we ﬁnd that T1 is more powerful, so
we employ T1 to be the 1-TDT test in this article. To keep consistent
with the above-mentioned statistics, we deﬁne .v;,ij=IMi<cif—1Mi>cif and
simi- =1Fi<cif—Ipi>cif for each case-mother pair and each case-father pair,
respectively. Under the null hypothesis of no association, s12”. and simi- have

where  and @ﬂsﬁn) are accordingly deﬁned and similarly

calculated as \faio (s ).

On the other hand, motivated by the construction of TDTp and TDTm,
we further develop two test statistics 1-TDTp and 1-TDTm based on the
stratiﬁcation of 1-TDT into paternal and maternal versions and expect them
to provide higher power than 1-TDT in the presence of imprinting effect.
In the effort to construct these two statistics, we ﬁrst illustrate the design
of 1-TDT, which is based on the four types of informative genotypes for
case-parent pairs in Table 1.

From Table 1, the 1-TDT could be divided into two parts. The 1-TDT
calculated merely with single-mother families essentially tests for association
based on the transmission information of the missing father. As a result, it
can be seen as a paternal version of 1-TDT and is deﬁned as 1-TDTp. On the
contrary, the 1-TDT merely calculated with single-father families essentially
tests for association based on the transmission information of the missing
mother. We take it as the maternal version of 1-TDT (1-TDTm). 1-TDTp
and 1-TDTm are formulated as follows,

i /
s],

1-TDTp = , 1-TDTIn = 
VIE) (SI/J) Van) (sin)

Indeed, 1-TDTp and 1-TDTm can be more efﬁcient than 1-TDT when there
are maternal imprinting effect and paternal imprinting effect, respectively
(Supplementary Materials).

To investigate the imprinting effects for the selection of an optimal statistic

among the three 1-TDT-type statistics, 1-PAT, formulated as s;/./\fa?0(s;),

is applied in incomplete nuclear families, where
/ _ my] [(1)
s1 — WZizl j:l (IMi<CifaCi/':l _IMi>CifaCi/':l)
m: [(i)
+(1_W)Zi:1 1'21(IFi>Cif,Cif:l—IFi<Cif,Cif:l)v

and w=Z;:11(i)/Z;:11(i), which is the proportion of case-father pairs
to case-parent pairs. Therefore, 1-TDTI* is constructed in an identical

framework of TDTI* with expression as follows,

_ * — _
1 TDTI _ 1 TDTmI{l_PAT<_Zal/2}

+1-TDT1{l1—pATlSZa1/2 l

+1-TDTpI{1_PAT>Zal/2 } .
Sharing the same property of TDTI*, 1-TDTI* will not be affected under the
situation where the target allele is in positive or negative LD with the disease
gene. 1-PAT and the three 1-TDT-type statistics are not independent, and the
covariances are derived in order to ﬁnd the asymptotic null distribution of
1-TDTI*.

2.4 Test statistic combining complete and incomplete
nuclear families

It is common in practice to collect complete nuclear families as well
as incomplete nuclear families. As such, a combined statistic, which
has not been discussed before, is of importance for enhancing testing
power. We develop a test statistic C-TDTI* in an identical framework of
TDTI* and 1-TDTI*, where we ﬁrst specify a set of combined statistics
for the association test, C-TDT, C-TDTp and C-TDTm, through natural
combinations of TDT and 1-TDT, TDTp and 1-TDTp, TDTm and 1-TDTm,
respectively. For instance,

s+s’
./v72?o(s>+v72?o(s’>

where s’=s;n+s]’J and then ma) =m(sﬁn)+\fa?0(s;,). Based on the
previous discussions, C-TDTp, C-TDT and C-TDTm follow standard normal
distributions under the null hypothesis of no association, and are the
corresponding optimal statistics to test for association in the presence of

maternal imprinting, no imprinting and paternal imprinting. Further, we apply

C-TDT =

C-PAT, equal to (s, +s;) / \faio (s1)+\fa?0(s;), for imprinting test in the
ﬁrst stage and formulate C-TDTI* as,

C-TDTI* = C-TDTm1'{C_PAT<—zal /2}

+ C.TDT1{ ‘C_PATlSZa1 /2l

+ C-TDTI;,I{C_PAT>Z[¥l /2}.

Since the complete nuclear families and incomplete nuclear families are
independent, the covariances between C-PAT and C-TDT type statistics could
be easily estimated to ﬁnd the asymptotic null distribution of C-TDTI*.

3 SIMULATION STUDY
3.1 Settings

A simulation study is carried out to Check the validity and to evaluate
the performance of the proposed test statistics TDTI*, 1-TDTI*
and C-TDTI*. Existing test statistics TDT and TDTI, 1-TDT and
1-TDTI, C-TDT and C-TDTI, which is just a simple sum of TDTI
and 1-TDTI, are selected for comparison in terms of size and power
for situations with or without imprinting. Throughout the simulation,
the additive genetic model is applied at the DSL with ¢D / D = 3¢d/d,
and the penetrance of heterozygous genotypes d/D and D/d are,
respectively, obtained as (pd/D =2¢d/d —I and ¢D/d =2¢d/d +1,
where ¢d/d is further ﬁxed at 0.1.

Family samples each consisting of 200 families each with one
affected Child and 100 families each with two affected Children
are utilized in the simulation study to investigate the performance

of proposed methods. In each sample, deﬁne 1' to control the
ratio of incomplete nuclear families and (3 as the probability of
the father being missing for each incomplete nuclear family. The
population stratiﬁcation demographic model, consisting of two
different homogeneous subpopulations, is considered throughout
the simulation. The proportion of the family samples from the ﬁrst
(second) population is taken to be 0.4 (0.6) and the frequencies of
disease allele D and maker allele M1 in the ﬁrst (second) population
are taken to be 0.1 (0.5) and 0.3 (0.8), respectively.

The recombination fraction between the DSL and ML is ﬁxed to be
0.001 in both subpopulations. The LD coefﬁcient between a marker
allele and a disease gene is measured by Lewontin D’ (Lewontin,
1988), which is taken to be 0.9 (0.63) in the ﬁrst (second) population
in the power study. All the simulation; results are estimated from
10000 replicates and are assessed at the signiﬁcance level a: 5%.

3.2 Sizes and powers of test statistics

Table 2 shows that the type I error rates of TDTI*, 1-TDTI*,
C-TDTI* and C-TDTI are consistent with the nominal 5% level,
regardless of imprinting degree I , missing father probability (3 and
incomplete nuclear family ratio 1'. In addition, C-TDT is still a valid
test for association study when there exist imprinting effects (TDT
and 1-TDT also control the size well in the simulation, results are
omitted for brevity).

For family samples with complete nuclear families, Figure 1 plots
the empirical power of three statistics, TDTI*, TDTI and TDT,
against ﬁve levels of imprinting effects. It can be seen that TDTI*
achieves the highest power in the presence of imprinting effects,
and this superiority becomes signiﬁcant with the increase of II
When there is no imprinting effects, though TDTI* reaches its own
minimum power, it is still comparable to TDT, which is due to the
fact that the actual test statistic of TDTI* is TDT when the null
hypothesis of no imprinting in the ﬁrst stage test is not rejected.

For family samples only with incomplete nuclear families,
Figure 2 compares the power of 1-TDTI*, 1-TDT and 1-TDTI
against father missing probability (3. In the presence of complete
paternal imprinting, it is observed that for each 13, the 1-TDTI*
is more powerful than the other two methods. As for 1-TDTI, its
own maximum power occurs when (3 = 0.5, which is in accordance
with the simulation results in the 1-TDTI paper (Hu et (11., 2007b).

Fig. 1. Powers of TDTI*, TDTI and TDT against ﬁve levels of imprinting
effects.

For both 1-TDT and 1-TDTI*, the powers decline with the increasing
(3 value. This is because when there exists paternal imprinting
effect, the case-father pairs play the major role in one-parent
association analysis. 1-TDTI*, which efﬁciently applies 1-TDTm,
is then more powerful than 1-TDT. In the presence of complete
maternal imprinting (results not shown), the powers of both 1-TDT
and 1-TDTI* ascend with the increasing (3 value, and 1-TDTI* gains
the highest power among the three statistics, as expected. When there
is no imprinting, it appears that 1-TDT and 1-TDTI* remain the same
for different (3 values and have similar level of testing efﬁciency.

For family samples combined of both complete and incomplete
nuclear families, we compare the performance of C-TDTI*, C-TDTI
and C-TDT in Figure 3 under different settings of 1' values, while (3
is ﬁxed to be 0.5 for incomplete families. The ﬁgure demonstrates
that for different 1' values, the power of the proposed C-TDTI* is
signiﬁcantly higher than the other two methods when there exist
imprinting effects, which is consistent with the ﬁndings obtained
from Figures 1 and 2. Meanwhile, we also ﬁnd C-TDTI may even
perform worse than C-TDT, and so is not recommended.

4 APPLICATION TO UK RHEUMATOID
ARTHRITIS DATA

We apply the proposed methods to SNP-based association analysis
of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a complex disease, and some
epigenetic processes, e.g. genetic imprinting, are suspected to
complicate the study of its genetic components (Gregersen, 1999).
The dataset used in this article is from the United Kingdom (John
et (11., 2004), which is provided by Genetic Analysis Workshop 15
(Amos et (11., 2007). In the dataset, there are 10156 SNP markers
over the 22 autosomes, genotyped on 157 families. Because of a
large proportion of missing genotype information of individuals
for each SNP marker, the reduced dataset for analysis is a mixture
of complete nuclear families and incomplete nuclear families, as
well as a mixture of families with one affected Child and families
with multiple affected Children. We henceforth employ both C-TDT
and C-TDTI* for SNPs to make an efﬁcient use of the available
information.

The results of C-TDT and C-TDTI* based on 22 Chromosomes
are plotted in Figure 4. Both tests suggest that the strongest evidence
for association is at SNP520297 on Chromosome 8 (P<1 >< 10T5).
Meanwhile, the comparison of the two subﬁgures roughly reveals the
existence of difference between the results of the two test statistics.
It inspires us to have a Closer look at the results on each Chromosome.
In this article, we merely present the association results on two 1 CM
intervals on Chromosome 2 (Fig. 5). In fact, an existing paper on
joint analysis of linkage and imprinting for RA has revealed higher
logarithmic odds (LOD) scores on Chromosome 2 under the model
allowing for imprinting than under the no imprinting model (Zhou
et (11., 2007). We ﬁnd that the association test allowing for imprinting
effects (C-TDTI*) also presents stronger evidence of association
than the conventional association test (C-TDT) for some SNPs on
Chromosome 2. Speciﬁcally, for the SNPs detected by C-PAT to
be imprinted on Chromosome 2, such as SNP56214, SNP67512,
SNP521719 and SNP521720, C-TDTI* indeed provides notable

smaller P-values than C-TDT. Because C-TDT and C-TDTI* are
shown to have similar and correct type I error rates in the simulation
study, the results exhibit considerable increase in information by
using the test statistic C-TDTI*, which incorporates the imprinting
effects into association analysis.

5 CONCLUSION

We have proposed a series of two-stage test statistics for association
analysis incorporating imprinting effects and introduced a general
approach to investigate the asymptotic distributions of these
statistics. Our method enjoys nice properties. The transmission-
based test statistics are calculated within families to protect against

possible population stratiﬁcation. The test statistics allow for a
ﬂexible use of complete and incomplete families, and thus provide
an efﬁcient way for dealing with the situation in which one
parental genotype is missing. Moreover, the method accommodates
nuclear families with multiple affected Children, and the dependency
between siblings in each family is considered in the calculation
of estimates for variances and covariances involved in the test
statistics. The simulation study shows that the proposed statistics
control the size well, as well as achieve higher power in association
testing than the existing methods when there exist imprinting effects
from modest to large. We have also demonstrated the practical
advantages of our method in the empirical association study on UK
RA data.

Transmission-based tests incorporating imprinting effects

 

Inspired by the test TDTI, TDTI* is constructed for complete
nuclear families, and is shown to be more powerﬁil than TDTI
when testing for association. Since the two tests distinguish from
each other by the use of imprinting test statistics in the ﬁrst stage,
additional simulations have been carried out to compare the power
of PAT and POET for imprinting effects under various scenarios. It
was found that PAT is more powerful than POET for various Choices
of marker and disease allele frequencies, genetic model and LD
coefﬁcient (see Supplementary Materials for results). So the above-
mentioned ﬁndings regarding TDTI* and TDTI are not obtained by
Chance.

So far, our simulation results for the sizes and the powers of
the tests are based on the asymptotic normality assumption, which
might be questionable when the study is small. To assess the validity
of the proposed tests for smaller datasets, we have also conducted
additional simulations with sample size being half or a quarter of
the one presented previously in the article, and we did not ﬁnd
any evidence of notable deviation from the nominal level of 5%
(Supplementary Materials). Since most practical studies would have
sample sizes at least matching the smallest of those in our simulation
study, we conclude that the use of asymptotic normality assumption
is in general reasonable and efﬁcient.

As the future work, we plan to extend our method to the
association analysis on quantitative trait loci, where the distributions
of quantitative traits need to be considered.

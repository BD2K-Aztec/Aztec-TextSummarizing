ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identifying genes altered in cancer plays a crucial role in
both understanding the mechanism of carcinogenesis and developing
novel therapeutics. It is known that there are various mechanisms of
regulation that can lead to gene dysfunction, including copy number
change, methylation, abnormal expression, mutation and so on.
Nowadays, all these types of alterations can be simultaneously inter-
rogated by different types of assays. Although many methods have
been proposed to identify altered genes from a single assay, there is
no method that can deal with multiple assays accounting for different
alteration types systematically.

Results: In this article, we propose a novel method, integration using
item response theory (integIRTy), to identify altered genes by using
item response theory that allows integrated analysis of multiple high-
throughput assays. When applied to a single assay, the proposed
method is more robust and reliable than conventional methods such
as Student’s t—test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. When used to in-
tegrate multiple assays, integIRTy can identify novel-altered genes
that cannot be found by looking at individual assay separately. We
applied integIRTy to three public cancer datasets (ovarian carcinoma,
breast cancer, glioblastoma) for cross-assay type integration which all
show encouraging results.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cancer progression involves successive genetic and epigenetic
alterations that transform normal cells into malignant derivatives
by acquiring the eight hallmarks of cancer: sustaining
proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting
cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogen-
esis, activating invasion and metastasis, reprogramming energy
metabolism and evading immune destruction (Hanahan

and Weinberg, 2011). As a result, it is of great interest to identify
altered genes as potential therapeutic targets. In the past, this
would have been a daunting task considering that the human
genome contains more than 20 000 genes. Using rapidly evolving
high-throughput technologies, researchers can now proﬁle the
whole genome with multiple assay modalities in a time and
cost-effective manner. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is
one current initiative that exploits these technological advances
(McLendon et al., 2008). For the same set of samples, TCGA
applies a variety of technologies including gene expression micro-
array, microRNA array, methylation array, array CGH, SNP
array and sequencing, to interrogate the genomes of several
types of cancer. TCGA and similar datasets pose a great chal-
lenge and opportunity for integrative bioinformatics research.

Over the last decade, several methodologies have been pro-
posed for integrating genome-wide expression and copy
number (CN) data. These methods can be roughly grouped
into four categories: stepwise, regression-based, correlation-
based and latent variable models (Huang et al., 2012; Lahti
et al., 2012). Many existing methods focus on the correlation
between assays and/or outcome. For example, Bicciato et a].
(2009) developed a stepwise method called SODEGIR to identify
overlapping genomic regions of differential expression and gen-
omic imbalance. Menezes et a]. (2009) used linear mixed models
to search for genes whose expression is affected by CN change.
Peng et a]. proposed penalized multiple regression to model the
dependence of RNA expression on DNA CN. There are also
methods based on canonical correlation analysis that aim to
ﬁnd associations between CN and expression (Le Cao et al.,
2009; Waaijenborg et al., 2008) or even with outcome (Witten
et al., 2009). Comparison of existing two-way integration meth-
ods is available (Lahti et al., 2012; Louhimo et al., 2012). The
CNAmet method developed by Louhimo et a]. (Louhimo and
Hautaniemi, 2011) takes methylation data into account and is
able to integrate three types of assays.

Our proposed method, integration using item response theory
(integIRTy), is a latent variable approach with a different goal:
integIRTy aims to use multiple assays to identify genes that are
altered in cancer samples compared to normal controls. This
general task is similar to differential expression analysis in a
tumor/normal comparison, for which good reviews are available
(Allison et al., 2006; Cui and Churchill, 2003). Conventional
methods for differential expression analysis only deal with one

type of data. IntegIRTy extends the analysis to multiple assay
types and defines an overall metric for gene alteration.
IntegIRTy automatically adjusts for heterogeneity in the data
and in principle can be applied simultaneously to any number
of whole genome assays.

The integIRTy model is motivated by the biological observa-
tion that tumor suppressor genes can be blocked (or oncogenes
can be activated) by different mechanisms in different patients.
One patient may have a deletion of the chromosomal region
containing a gene; another may exhibit hypermethylation; a
third may have a mutation that hampers transcription or trans-
lation or leads to a loss of function. Each kind of alteration could
be sufﬁciently rare that the importance of the gene might be
overlooked in analyses that study only one kind of assay.
Mechanism-driven analytical methods for data integration
(such as those that prioritize genes with evidence that CN alter-
ations lead directly to mRNA expression changes) could still
overlook genes that are sometimes deleted and sometimes hyper-
methylated. We address this situation statistically using
a (binary) latent variable that serves as an indicator of whether
a gene is ‘important’ for an individual patient’s cancer.
Conditional on this latent variable, we assume that changes in
different assay platforms (CN, mutation, methylation, etc.) are
statistically independent. Changes in mRNA expression may still
occur independently of these assays if, for example, they result
from failures of regulation by miRs or transcription factors.
Thus, the goal of our method differs from existing methods;
we want to identify genes that are frequently altered in cancer,
regardless of the kind of alteration.

We base integIRTy on IRT, which is widely used to construct,
score, evaluate and compare psychological and educational tests
(Baker, 2004). A test consists of a set of items (or questions)
designed to measure a certain ability. Unlike earlier test theories,
IRT models a person’s response to a test at the item level rather
than the test level. Therefore, IRT can simultaneously model two
entities: (i) the examinee’s latent trait (or ability) that determines
his or her performance on the test and (ii) the characteristics of
each item, represented by its difﬁculty and discrimination. This
ability to simultaneously model examinees and test items makes
IRT ideal for modeling complex and heterogeneous genomic
data where different genes and samples from various assays
behave differently.

To transform the IRT terminology to our application, we treat
genes as examinees and samples as items. In this way, we can
unleash the power of IRT to address many difficulties in inte-
grative analysis: (i) the heterogeneity between assays can be
resolved by the auto-adjustable item parameters, making the
estimation of an ‘overall latent trait of alteration’ possible and
meaningful. (ii) Integration across assays can be easily achieved
by assembling a larger test with different assays supplying the
items. (iii) The estimated latent trait of gene alteration as well as
the item difﬁculty parameters are intuitive and can be used for
further inference.

We have applied this method to three public datasets: two
TCGA datasets, ovarian carcinoma (OV) (The Cancer Genome
Atlas Research Network, 2011) and glioblastoma (GBM)
(McLendon et al., 2008) and one breast cancer (BRCA) dataset
(Pollack et al., 2002). All three datasets contain multiple
high-throughput assays interrogating the same set of samples.

We estimated the latent trait of alteration for each gene from
each individual assay and after combining assays. We show that
after integrating multiple assays, novel genes can be identiﬁed.
The new method was also compared to conventional methods
such as Student’s t-test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test and to the
CNAmet approach for integrating different assays. To assess
statistical significance, which is not provided by ordinary IRT
applications, we used a permutation test to compute empirical
P-values.

2 METHODS

2.1 Item response theory

IRT refers to a family of models that describe the relationship of an exam-
inee’s performance on a set of test items to his or her underlying (latent)
ability level. In practice, this relationship is modeled by a monotonically
increasing function called the item characteristic curve (ICC; see Fig. 1).
For binary responses (i.e. right or wrong), a two-parameter logistic model
(2PL) can be speciﬁed as follows:

eai(6/’bi)

Pilaf) = 1 + ems/7b,)

(1)

The left-hand side is the probability of a correct response to item i for
person j with ability level  On the right side, b,- is the item difﬁculty
parameter for item i that determines the position of the ICC in relation to
the ability scale. The item difﬁculty is the ability level required to achieve
a 50% chance of a correct response on this item. As b,- increases, the item
becomes harder. The remaining parameter, a,, is the item discrimination
for item i, which represents how well the item discriminates among the
examinees. It is proportional to the slope of the ICC at ability level bi.
Higher discrimination means that the item discriminates more clearly
among the examinees and hence is more informative. Figure la shows
an ICC with difﬁculty b,: 0.5 and discrimination a,= 1. Figure lb shows
several ICCs ﬁtted from real data.

As noted earlier, we apply IRT by treating genes as examinees and
patients as items. The main parameter of scientiﬁc interest is the latent
‘ability’ of each gene to be altered in cancer samples across all assay types
and samples. Patients with many altered genes (low-item difﬁculty) pro-
vide less-useful information than patients with only a few altered genes
(high-item difﬁculty). Groups of patients with similar patterns of altered
genes tend to have a high-item discrimination and so are weighted more
heavily than a patient who has an idiosyncratic set of altered genes (and
low-item discrimination).

Importantly, the IRT model is expressed at the item level rather than
the test level. This feature gives IRT models the so-called invariant prop-
erty. The invariant property implies that: (i) item parameters are charac-
teristics of the item and hence are not dependent upon examinees who
take the test and (ii) the ability parameter that characterizes an examinee
is not test-dependent and hence scores from different tests are
comparable.

The 2PL model can be augmented by introducing a guessing
parameter, which is then called the three-parameter logistic model
(3PL). There is also a one-parameter logistic model (lPL), obtained by
forcing a,- equal to one. This model is also called the Rasch model. Since
the three models are nested, one can use a Likelihood Ratio test to select
the best model (Neyman and Pearson, 1933). Alternatively, we can use
information-based criterion such as Akaike’s information criterion or
Schwarz’s Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to identify the best
model.

2.2 Parameter estimation

Parameter estimation has received tremendous considerations in the IRT
literature. Methods under the maximum likelihood framework include
joint maximum likelihood (JMLE), marginal maximum likelihood
(MMLE) and conditional maximum likelihood (CML). JMLE has
been shown to have many inherent problems, the most serious being
that it is not statistically consistent (Baker, 2004). It also fails to estimate
the latent trait when all items are answered correctly or incorrectly. In
comparison, both MMLE and CML provide consistent parameter esti-
mates. However, the CML approach is only possible under the Rasch
model (Andersen, 1980). Recently, Bayesian estimation has also been
used (Fox, 2010). We adopt the MMLE procedure that has become the
standard method since its introduction, for which an implementation in R
is available through the ltm package (Rizopoulos, 2006).

According to Baker and Kim, the MMLE can be formulated under the
EM framework (Baker, 2004). First, the item parameters are estimated by
maximizing the observed data likelihood after integrating out the latent
traits. For example, the contribution of the mth examinee to the observed
likelihood can be written as:

iiK

in. = :Iog fps... = liam.bm; made (2)

1:1

In Equation (2), a prior distribution ﬁe) needs to be speciﬁed for the
latent trait (usually a standard normal distribution is used), x,-,,, is the
response to item i for examinee m and K is the total number of items in
the test. Since there is no closed form formula for the observed data
likelihood, GaussiHermite quadrature is required to evaluate the inte-
gral. Second, given current item parameter estimates a,13, the latent trait
is estimated by the posterior mode as:

i:K

em = argmgleog fax... = Ira. b; 9)](9) (3)

2.3 Estimation of latent trait from integrated data

Conceptually, estimating the latent trait for integrated data would be the
same as estimation from an individual assay. However, when there are

many assays to integrate or when there are many items in each assay,
parameter estimation could become ill-conditioned. This can happen
when there are more unknown parameters (i.e. each item introduces
two parameters) than the data can afford to estimate. One way to deal
with this problem is to ﬁx the item parameters estimated from the indi-
vidual assay type when modeling the combined data. That is, the item
parameters characterizing the items remain the same when we estimate
the integrated latent trait. This approach is valid because the IRT model
has the invariant property. Since the item parameters are pre-estimated,
we can simply calculate the latent traits for integrated data using the
maximum a posteriori estimates (Magis, 2011).

2.4 Statistical signiﬁcance assessment

In order to identify genes showing statistically signiﬁcant alteration,
we need to derive the null distribution of latent traits. Since there is no
existing method for this purpose in the itemiresponse setting, we use
a non-parametric test to deﬁne empirical P-values based on permutation.
Two alternative strategies can be used to infer the null distribution of
latent traits similar to the ‘gene sampling’ and ‘sample label permutation’
methods (Ackermann and Strimmer, 2009).

Gene sampling corresponds to calculating latent traits after permut-
ing the binary matrix within samples. In this case, computed P-values
measure how different the observed latent trait is from the case where
alterations happen randomly on the genes. Note that this method can
be used even when normal (control) samples are unavailable. When
normal samples are present, the sample label permutation approach
can be used. The null latent trait can be computed by following the
same procedure as computing the observed latent traits after permut-
ing sample labels. As Ackermann and Strimmer point out, the two
approaches can yield quite different results since they test different
null hypotheses. Once the empirical P-value is calculated, multiple
testing can be adjusted using existing methods (Dudoit et al., 2003).
It should be noted that our integration approach entails no additional
price in terms of multiple comparisons compared to analyzing just one
dataset.

2.5 Data dichotomization

Proper transformation of the data is needed to ﬁt the IRT model. To do
this, one needs to deﬁne a metric measuring the alteration magnitude.
Then, a speciﬁed cutoff is used to dichotomize the data. Many methods
can be used to deﬁne the alteration magnitude. For two-channel array,
data which provides the log ratio of intensities from tumor and healthy
reference tissue, the log ratio itself can serve as alteration magnitude.
When normal tissue is present, a feasible metric for expression data is
to use a Z-like statistic that measures the deviation of a tumor sample
from normal controls (see Section 2 in Supplementary Material).

We could dichotomize the methylation data the same way as expres-
sion data. However, since methylation measurements (the ,8 value) are
bounded between zero and one with an asymmetric distribution, a more
biologically relevant method is to ﬁrst discretize the methylation
into three groups: unmethylated (,8<0.25), partly methylated
(0.25 5 ,8 5 0.75) and highly methylated (,8>0.75). If the group member-
ship for a tumor sample differs from the normal reference (deﬁned by the
normal ,8 mean value), then we code this gene in this sample as altered.

Transformation of CN data is easier. Choosing a ﬁxed threshold (e.g.
0.1, 0.2, . . . , 0.7), genes with absolute adjusted log2 ratio larger than this
cutoff are converted to 1, and 0 otherwise. We use the adjusted log2 ratio
derived by subtracting measurements on matched normal tissue from
tumor tissue to exclude germline CN change that is irrelevant to
tumorigenesis.

Generally, the choice of cutoff to dichotomize the alteration magnitude
should not affect the ﬁnal result as long as it is sensible. This can be
evaluated through a sensitivity analysis, which we present below by com-
paring the latent trait estimates obtained from various versions of the
data transformed using different cutoffs.

3 RESULTS

We performed a simulation study to show that the model can
recover both the item parameters and latent traits in an integra-
tion setting (see Section 5 in Supplementary Material). We then
investigated three public datasets (Table 1). Details about the
samples and preprocessing steps are provided in Section 1 in
Supplementary Material. Both the 0V and GBM datasets con-
tain three types of assays interrogating expression (Expr), methy-
lation (Methy) and CN. The BRCA dataset only contains data
for expression and CN. All three datasets have been examined in
detail. However, due to page limitations, we mainly focus on OV
data and present other datasets when necessary. The lPL, 2PL
and 3PL models have been ﬁtted on each dataset. Based on BIC,
the 2PL model is shown to be the preferred model in all datasets
(Supplementary Table S3). Hence, all results presented below are
from 2PL model.

3.1 Alteration pattern across assays

IntegIRTy allows us to evaluate and compare the alteration pat-
tern across different assays. Figure 2 compares the alteration
from individual assays and after integration for OV, BRCA
and GBM datasets. A common pattern is that there are not
many genes with severe alteration in all assays. We observed
little correlation between the assays for either the conventional
method or our IRT method. This is in agreement with previous
results that showed only a small fraction of the variation in
expression was attributable to methylation (Wu et al., 2010) or
to CN change (Stranger et al., 2007) in a global sense.

The amount contributed by individual assays to the integrated
data differs. For both 0V and GBM, the integrated latent trait is
primarily inﬂuenced by methylation data, followed by CN and
then expression. In BRCA, expression has a larger inﬂuence than
CN. The correlation between latent traits from integrated data
and individual datasets is well behaved compared to the conven-
tional method where the integrated P-value is mostly dominated
by the CN data.

3.2 Sensitivity analysis

The latent trait estimates derived using different thresholds to
dichotomize the expression data agree well, especially for
high-latent traits (Supplementary Fig. Slaic). In the low-latent
trait range, agreement is somewhat worse, mainly due to high SE
associated with latent trait estimates. The agreement for CN is
even better (Supplementary Fig. Sldif). Hence, the proposed
method is robust to cutoff choice during data transformation.
In comparison, the naive score that simply computes the percent-
age of ‘correct responses’ (i.e. alterations) varies when using dif-
ferent thresholds (Supplementary Fig. S2). Although the latent
trait estimates are similar using different thresholds, we use rela-
tively stringent thresholds (2.5 for expression and 0.4 for CN) for
further analyses.

3.3 Contribution of individual assays to
integrated analysis

We performed a series of analyses to determine how individual
assays contribute to the list of genes found by an integrate ana-
lysis using integIRTy. Figure 3 breaks down the lists of ‘top N’
genes (for N from 100 to 1000) from the integrated analysis of the
0V dataset to see which genes are on one, two or all three of
the top N lists from the individual assays. This ﬁgure shows that
the top N list for methylation has the best agreement with the
integrated list, with expression being second and CN having the
least agreement. The relative contributions of the three assays to
the integrated list remain consistent as we increase the length of
the gene list. Moreover, both the absolute and relative number of
‘novel’ genes decreases as N increases. We performed similar
analyses integrating assays two at a time and constructed similar
plots (Supplementary Figs $13 and $14); the findings from this
sequential integration are consistent with Figure 3.

3.4 Novel-altered genes emerge when data are integrated

The latent trait estimated from the integrated data represents the
overall propensity of a gene to be altered in at least one assay
(expression, methylation or CN). Although this latent trait is a

Number of Genes Selected

Fig. 3. Relations between integrated and individual gene lists in OV data.
We selected the top (10(F1000) genes from the integrated analysis and
from individual assays (E, expression; M, methylation; C, copy number).
Each bar is equivalent to a Venn diagram showing how many of the top
genes from the integrated analysis came from one, two (EM, expression
and methylation; EC, expression and copy number; MC, methylation and
copy number) or all three (EMC) individual assay gene lists. Black re-
gions and numbers at the top of each bar count the number of ‘novel’
genes that only appear on the list from the integrated analysis

compromise among the latent traits estimated from individual
assays, in many cases, the integrated rank (smaller rank for
larger latent trait) is smaller than the average rank of the three
assays (Supplementary Fig. S3a, 83c and S3e). There are also
several occasions (296 genes in OV, 380 genes in BRCA, 811
genes in GBM) where the integrated rank is smaller than any
of the ranks from individual assay (Supplementary Fig. S3b, 83d
and S3f). The ability to identify altered genes that cannot be
identified by individual assays shows the merits of data integra-
tion as well as the effectiveness of our method.

Table 2 shows the latent trait and rank for the top 20 genes
selected using the integrated data for the 0V data (similar results
for BRCA and GBM data are in Supplementary Tables SI and
S2). The genes CDKN2A, VEGFC and STMNl are only dis-
covered by the integrated analysis (in top 20) and would not have
been discovered using any of the individual assays (out of top
100). To verify that these genes are altered, we examined the
original data and their relationships (Supplementary Figs
$486). The original data strongly support our ﬁnding.
Interestingly, mRNA up-regulation of CDKN2A is associated
with increased methylation. Further, functional annotations
show that these genes are linked to cancer. Speciﬁcally,
CDKN2A is involved in two critical cell cycle regulatory path-
ways, the p53 pathway and the RB pathway. CDKN2A plays an
important role in many human cancers including pancreatic
cancer, esophageal and gastric cancers, leukemia, bladder
cancer and cutaneous melanoma. Differential expression of
VEGFC is related to the different propensity to lymph node
metastasis in thyroid cancers (Hung et al., 2003). STMNl is an
oncoprotein-regulating microtubule dynamics. Defective
STMNl causes constant mitotic spindle assembly and hence un-
regulated cell growth (Cassimeris, 2002).

Among the top 20 genes discovered by integration, the
BRCA datasets identify two novel genes (SELENBPl and
EDIL3), while the GBM datasets identify 17 novel genes
(Supplementary Table S2). SELENBPl has been found to medi-
ate the anticancer action of selenium in prostate Wang and
Sytkowski, 1998), lung (Chen et al., 2004) and colon (Kim
et al., 2006) cancer. EDIL3 plays an important role in mediating
angiogenesis (Aoki et al., 2005). Functions of the 17 novel genes
in GBM data include cell death, hematological system
development, cell morphology, nervous system development
and cell cycle, according to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(Ingenuityhemegismed] Systems, www.ingenuity.com).

3.5 Comparison to conventional methods

Identifying altered genes is essentially a two-group (tumor versus
normal) comparison problem. Hence, we can compare our

LT, latent trait. Genes with ranks lower than 100 are coded differently in the rank column (E, expression; M, methylation; C, copy number). Genes
identiﬁed only by integrated data are coded as I in the integrated rank column.

and CN data) or rank test (for methylation data which is
bounded between zero and one) (see Supplementary Fig. S7).
There is no direct test that applies to combined data. Inspired
by Fisher’s method for meta-analysis based on P-values, we use
the geometric mean of the P-values from each assay to represent
the ‘conventional’ P-value from the integrated data. Empirical
P-values for the latent traits were computed based on the per-
mutation test described previously. A gene was assigned a posi-
tive call if its P-value was less than a speciﬁc cutoff. Thus, we can
divide the genes into four categories: positive/negative (positive
call by our method and negative call by conventional method),
negative/positive (negative call by our method and positive call
by conventional method), positive/positive (both methods give
positive calls) and negative/negative (both methods give negative
calls). Conventional methods model genes separately while our
method models all genes and samples simultaneously. Hence, we
do not expect a perfect correlation between latent traits and
P-values from conventional methods.

We inspected the original measurements and found that the
positive/negative genes found by our method are meaningful and
very likely to be truly altered genes while negative/positive genes
missed by our method are actually not severely altered even
though they are statistically signiﬁcant due to increased sample
size or batch effect (see Fig. 4). For example, positive/negative
genes usually exhibit non-Gaussian expression which cannot be
detected by the t-test but can be identiﬁed by our method as
shown in Figure 4a. Compared to normal, this gene is expressed
16-fold higher in >15% of the tumor samples which suggests it is
likely to be altered. Figure 4b shows a typical example of a nega-
tive/positive gene in expression. Although the increased sample

size enables us to compute a signiﬁcant P-value, a statistically
significant difference does not necessarily mean a biological dif-
ference. In this example, there is almost no difference in the mean
expression (8.7 versus 8.1) which strongly suggests that our
method gives the right decision. In Figure 40, a positive/negative
gene is shown that obviously exhibits different methylation pat-
tern that the rank test fails to detect. In comparison, negative/
positive genes are usually not biologically different (i.e. almost all
samples have beta value <0.25 and hence are unmethylated) but
statistically different mainly due to a batch effect (Fig. 4d). For
CN data, there are many negative/positive cases where t-test as-
signs more than half of the genes a 0 P-value due to large sample
size (571 tumor and 567 normal samples). In fact, the difference
of mean log; ratio between tumor and normal is biologically
negligible for almost all of these genes.

3.6 Item parameters characterize properties of samples

While the estimated latent traits characterize the properties of
genes, the item parameters can characterize patient samples.
Samples with small item difﬁculty are easier to be altered and
hence contain more alterations. In both 0V and GBM data,
expression data have the largest (median) difﬁculty followed by
methylation and then CN (Supplementary Fig. S8). This implies
the frequency of CN alteration is higher compared to expression
or methylation. The widespread CN change in CV data identi-
fied by our model agrees with previous ﬁnding (The Cancer
Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011). The median item dif-
ficulty for expression and CN in BRCA data is similar, although
the difﬁculty estimates for CN are more variable, suggesting a
higher heterogeneity in CN.

Fig. 4. Example genes with disconcordant calls between conventional method and our method. The original measurement is plotted against sample index
after sorting by tissue type and batch number. Red circles indicate altered values based on dichotomized data; green circles indicate unaltered values. The
expression from normal control samples are indicated by solid green dots. Black solid lines represent tumor and normal mean. Dashed lines denote the
component means estimated from two-component mixture. In the panel titles, we show gene symbol, latent ability, percentage of tumor samples altered
(rate) and conventional test P-value. (a) A typical gene missed by t-test but identiﬁed by our method. Bimodality index (BI) shown in the title strongly
suggests a subgroup of the tumor samples have a large magnitude of overexpression compared to normal samples and hence, is likely to be altered.
(b) A gene missed by our method but ﬂagged by t-test. This is an example where statistical signiﬁcance does not imply biological signiﬁcance. The
difference between tumor and normal sample is minor. As a result, our method makes the correct decision. (0) A typical gene missed by rank test but
ﬂagged by our method. More than 50% of the tumor samples have increased methylation which strongly suggests altered methylation. (d) A gene missed
by our method but ﬂagged by rank test. The trend of beta value here is mostly due to batch effect, not biological difference. All tumor and normal
samples are not methylated (,8 > 0.25). Accordingly, our method assigns a very low-latent trait estimate. In comparison, the conventional method dictates
a strong statistical difference between tumor and normal simply due to batch effect

3.7 Complementary information provided by integIRTy
and CNAmet

We compared integIRTy with CNAmet, another method
developed to integrate expression, methylation and CN data

(Louhimo and Hautaniemi, 2011). Although CNAmet shares a
similar idea by dichtomizing methylation and CN data before
integration, it has a different goal. Rather than identify genes
altered between tumor and normal samples, CNAmet searches

Fig. 5. Complementary information provided by integIRTy and
CNAmet. (a) Overexpression in tumor where the regulation by methyla-
tion and CN is not synergistic. As a result, CNAmet fails to detect it.
(b) Mild overexpression mainly driven by CN gain. integIRTy did not
detect this gene due to the high-background CN change.
(0) Overexpression in tumor samples driven by hypomethylation and
CN gain. Genes like this are easy to be detected by both methods.
((1) Expression is turned off in both tumor and normal samples due to
hypermethylation. Since there is little difference between tumor and
normal, both methods suggest it is not altered

for genes whose expression is synergistically regulated by methy-
lation and CN. Conceptually, gene alteration can happen with or
without synergistic regulation and vice versa. This is conﬁrmed
by real data analysis where both alteration without synergistic
regulation (Fig. 5a) and no alteration yet under synergistic regu-
lation (Fig. 5b) are observed. When both methods give concord-
ant calls (Fig. 5c and d), integIRTy and CNAmet provide
complementary information that not only tell us whether a
gene is altered but the underlying mechanism. Interestingly,
roughly half of the altered genes are not under synergistic regu-
lation and half of the genes under synergistic regulation are not
altered (Supplementary Fig. S9).

4 DISCUSSION

As the cost of high-throughput technology drops dramatically, it
becomes common to interrogate samples with multiple modal-
ities of assays simultaneously. However, systematically integrat-
ing these assays is rarely achieved by existing methods.
Here, we propose a natural and interpretable framework to in-
tegrate heterogeneous high-throughput datasets using IRT. This
is the first application of IRT to integrative bioinformatics
research.

In our approach, both samples and genes are simultaneously
modeled through the item response model. The heterogeneity
among different datasets is automatically adjusted by fitting
different item parameters. The integrated latent trait provides a

nice metric to deﬁne the overall propensity to alteration in all
assays. Importantly, the integrated latent trait can be used to
identify novel genes that cannot be identiﬁed by looking at
each dataset individually. Furthermore, the estimated latent
trait together with item parameters characterizing the properties
of genes and patient samples can be used as an intuitive visual aid
to examine the high-dimensional dataset.

Compared to conventional methods, our method is able to
identify altered genes that are more reliable and likely to be
biologically meaningful. With increased sample size, the conven-
tional method has increased power to detect a difference between
tumor and normal samples. However, in many cases, such dif-
ferences are dubious and irrelevant to the underlying biology. In
comparison, genes identiﬁed by our method ensure a biological
difference. The reason is that latent traits are computed from the
dichotomized data with the biology (alteration status) already
built in. Another advantage of our method is that it does not
make any distributional assumption about the data. This enables
us to identify genes that are missed by conventional methods
such as the t-test. It should be pointed out that our method
mainly focused on the alteration status rather than the correl-
ations between different assays. As a result, the direction of regu-
lation is not modeled. For instance, identified alteration in
expression can be either overexpression or underexpression.
Nevertheless, when a gene is overexpressed in one group of
patients while underexpressed in another group, our method
has the advantage to still identify such genes even when the
mean expression is unaffected. In this respect, it is similar to
the PPST test introduced to ﬁnd markers in mRNA expression
data (Lyons-Weiler et al., 1994).

We have chosen to dichotomize all of the assays as part of our
approach to integration; this approach simpliﬁes the integration
step because all of the data inputs are binary. While the logistic
model in Equation (1) requires binary data, the heart of our
approach lies in the latent variable that indicates ‘alteration’
and appears as a probability on the left-hand side of the equa-
tion. IRT has been generalized to other kinds of data by chan-
ging the right-hand side of Equation (1). For ordinal data with
more than two categories (which might arise from categorizing
CN data as loss, normal or gain), one can use the generalized
partial credit model (Muraki, 1992), the rating scale model
(Andrich, 1978) or the graded response model (Samejima,
1969). For continuous-bounded data (like that from a methyla-
tion array), one can use beta distributions (Noel and Dauvier,
2012). For normally distributed data (such as log-transformed
mRNA expression data), the natural generalization of the IRT
model (Mellenbergh, 1994; Moustaki, 1996) is equivalent to
factor analysis (FA). FA has been used previously to integrate
expression data proﬁled by different microarray platforms
(Wang et al., 2011). For individual assays, it is likely that one
of these alternative models that preserve more of the continuous
input data would prove more effective than the logistic model
that we present. However, using different models on each data
type presents other difﬁculties. In order to integrate the data
from multiple assays, it becomes necessary to specify the joint
distributions, which could result in an elaborate and unwieldy
model. IntegIRTy resolves this issue by coding all of the data
from all assays into binary. We believe that this simpliﬁcation of
the model provides further beneﬁts by making the results more

complex models can produce better results.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Unlike traditional diagnosis of an existing disease state,
detecting the pre-disease state just before the serious deterioration of
a disease is a challenging task, because the state of the system may
show little apparent change or symptoms before this critical transition
during disease progression. By exploring the rich interaction informa-
tion provided by high-throughput data, the dynamical network bio-
marker (DNB) can identify the pre-disease state, but this requires
multiple samples to reach a correct diagnosis for one individual,
thereby restricting its clinical application.

Results: In this article, we have developed a novel computational
approach based on the DNB theory and differential distributions be-
tween the expressions of DNB and non-DNB molecules, which can
detect the pre-disease state reliably even from a single sample taken
from one individual, by compensating insufficient samples with exist-
ing datasets from population studies. Our approach has been vali-
dated by the successful identification of pre-disease samples from
subjects or individuals before the emergence of disease symptoms
for acute lung injury, influenza and breast cancer.

1 INTRODUCTION

Based on only one single sample from an individual, traditional
biomarkers can indicate whether the sample is in a given disease
state or not; however, they cannot generally diagnose the pre-
disease state, which can be Viewed as a special normal state
just before major deterioration or critical transition to a disease
(Fig. 1a). In other words, it is a highly challenging problem to
distinguish the pre-disease state from the normal state because
there may be little apparent difference between these two states,
in contrast to the generally signiﬁcant difference between the
normal state and the disease state (or the early disease state).
One way to detect early signals of an abrupt change in a

system, is to directly construct a mathematical model for the
system and predict the progression details (Hirata et al., 2010;
May et al., 1977). However, in most realistic cases, such a model
for a speciﬁc system or a disease is not available due to the
complicated and uncertain nature of most such systems. The
critical slowing-down theory (Strogatz et al., 1994) provides a
useful way to detect the early warning signals of critical transi-
tions for a general system (Scheffer et al., 2009), and has been
applied to ecosystems (Carpenter et al., 2005, 2006, 2011; Drake
and Griffen, 2010; Scheffer et al., 2001), climate systems (Dakos
et al., 2008; Lenton et al., 2008; Held and Kleinen, 2004; Kleinen
et al., 2003), economics and global ﬁnance (Kambhu et al., 2007;
May et al., 2008). However, there are two main limitations to this
method: (i) it requires a series of time-course data for each indi-
vidual, i.e. a large number of samples for each subject; (ii) the
measurements are required to cover those variables that show the
critical slowing-down dynamics, i.e. extensive knowledge on
the system is required. Clearly, for many complex systems, in
particular, biomedical systems, it is generally difﬁcult to obtain
data (or a model) of an individual satisfying both these condi-
tions. In fact, typical data currently available for molecular biol-
ogy and medicine are high-throughput OMICS data with a small
number of samples (for each individual) but high dimensions.
Although these data usually lack dynamic information due
to the small number of time-course samples, they are still valu-
able because of the rich information regarding correlations or
interactions among many variables of the high-throughput meas-
urements. With rapid advancements in high-throughput technol-
ogies, OMICS data have been measured and made available for
complex diseases such as asthma attacks (V enegas et al., 2005),
epileptic seizures (Litt et al., 2001) and many others (He et al.,
2012; Liu et al., 2001; McSharry et al., 2003; Paek et al., 2005;
Roberto et al., 2003). To overcome the two problems of the
critical slowing-down method, a new model-free approach, the
dynamical network biomarker (DNB), was developed to detect
early warning signals of complex diseases even with a small
number of samples (Chen et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012). By
exploring ﬂuctuation and correlation information among mol-
ecules, the DNB can identify the pre-disease state (Fig. la) and
thus predict the critical transition before a serious deterioration,
in contrast to diagnosing the disease state by traditional

Fig. 1. Outline for identifying the pre-disease state based on a single
sample by DNB. This outline shows how the DNB-S score identiﬁes
the pre-disease state based on a single sample. (a) Disease progression
can be divided into three stages, i.e. normal, pre-disease and disease
states, where the pre-disease state is a special ‘normal’ state just before
the drastic transition (serious disease deterioration). There are generally
signiﬁcant differences between the normal and disease states, but there
may not be apparent differences between the normal and pre-disease
states. (b) Assume that there is a single case-sample and a number of
controlisamples (or normal samples). Furthermore, the DNB is assumed
to be available, e. g. from previous studies. We aim to diagnose whether a
single case sample is in the pre-disease state or not. (c) DNB molecules
have double-peak distribution in the pre-disease state (the DNB case) but
show single-peak distribution in the normal state (the DNB control),
while non-DNB molecules show single-peak distribution in the pre-
disease state (the non-DNB case). The horizontal axis represents gene
expression levels in the log scale as an example. By exploiting such dif-
ferential distributions in a single sample, i.e. the KiL distribution dis-
tance, a composite index (i.e. the DNB-S score) is constructed to diagnose
single samples. ((1) The DNB-S score is relatively high when the case
sample is in the pre-disease state and relatively low when the case
sample is in the normal state. Thus, we can identify the pre-disease
state with a single sample using the DNB-S score, i.e. we can detect the
early warning signal of the disease state

biomarkers. Moreover, it has been shown that those molecules in
DNB are not necessarily the result of the disease but make the
ﬁrst move from the normal state toward the disease state in a
collective manner through a critical transition (Liu et al., 2012).
One significant feature of DNB members (or molecules) is that in
the pre-disease state, they ﬂuctuate dynamically and are strongly
correlated. Therefore, this group of molecules, or the DNB can
characterize the dynamic features of the underlying system, and
provide early warning signals for detecting the imminent critical
transition (Liu et al., 2013a, b, c). The DNB has been successfully
applied to many complex diseases, such as liver cancer, to detect
sudden deterioration and study the underlying mechanisms
(Chen et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012, 2013a, b, c; Li et al., 2013).

Although the DNB can identify the pre-disease state, it still
requires multiple samples for an individual, thereby restricting its
clinic application. Clearly, identifying the pre-disease state with
only a single sample in a reliable manner is challenging but of
great importance, since it provides not only a feasible and

cost-effective method for clinic diagnosis but also signiﬁcantly
relieves the burden of sample collections for individuals. In this
article, by exploring the differential distributions of DNB mem-
bers and non-DNB members, we developed a novel computa-
tional method for efﬁciently and accurately identifying the pre-
disease state before the critical transition in a complex disease
with just a single sample (Fig. 1b).

Speciﬁcally, DNB molecules typically have a double-peak dis-
tribution in the pre—disease state owing to their strongly ﬂuctuat-
ing and correlated nature in the pre-disease stage, but have a
single-peak distribution in the normal state due to their dynam-
ically stable behavior in the normal stage (see Supplementary
Material A for details). On the other hand, non-DNB molecules
are observed to show a single-peak distribution even in the pre-
disease state due to their stable behavior (Fig. 1c). Thus, differ-
ential distributions between those groups of molecules can be
identiﬁed from a single sample provided there are multiple con-
trol samples, which are generally available in practice. In this
article, we use KullbackiLeibler divergence (KiL divergence),
which measures the difference between two data distributions
to formulate the DNB single-sample score (the DNB-S score)
by three factors. Each factor in the DNB-S score reflects an
aspect of the dynamic features when the system is near a transi-
tion point (Fig. 1). Based on this scheme, a new scoring criterion,
i.e. the DNB-S score, was proposed as a quantitative measure-
ment of each sample (Fig. 1d). Note that too few genes in the
DNB may give a biased result due to incomplete information on
the distribution.

Moreover, we have theoretically and numerically shown that
the DNB-S score is relatively high when the system is in a pre-
disease state, and relatively low when the system is in a normal or
disease state. Hence, the DNB-S score provides a reliable signal
to identify the pre-disease state. Both theoretical and computa-
tional results show that high-dimensional information of data
can be utilized to compensate insufﬁcient samples (Huang
et al., 2011; Sciuto et al., 2005; Saeki et al., 2009), which is the
main reason why DNB can detect the pre-disease state by a
single sample with high-throughput measurements.

In addition, our previous study indicates that the DNB-S score
is a model-free approach that can be theoretically applied to any
disease or biological system with clear transition events.
Furthermore, the DNB-S score in this work is not used for iden-
tifying the critical transition point or early disease state but for
detecting the state just before the critical transition point (i.e. the
pre—disease state), and therefore, in comparison with existing
methods, it is of great importance for the early diagnosis of com-
plex diseases. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of
the theoretical work, we applied our method to detect the pre-
disease state for three diseases by single samples, i.e. lung injury
induced by carbonyl chloride inhalation exposure (GSE2565),
MCF-7 human breast cancer resulting from heregulin (HRG)
(GSE13009) and human inﬂuenza infection caused by H3N2
Virus (GSE30550), all of which successfully validated our
predictions.

Identifying critical transitions by a single sample

 

to preprocess input datasets. The detailed algorithm for the DNB-S score
is given in Supplementary Material C.

2.1 Theoretical basis

Disease progression can be generally divided into three stages, i.e. (i) the
normal state, (ii) the pre-disease state and (iii) the disease state (Fig. la).
The normal state is a ‘healthy’ stage, in which the state change is gradual.
The pre-disease state is actually the limit case of the normal state just
before the critical transition. Further progression in the pre-disease state
will result in a drastic state change to the disease state. However, the pre-
disease state is considered reversible to the normal state because appro-
priate medical treatments or a change in lifestyle can convert this state
back to a normal state. On the other hand, the disease state represents a
seriously ill stage, from which is difﬁcult to return to the normal state,
even with advanced treatment, in the case of major complex diseases such
as cancer and diabetes.

Traditional biomarkers, e.g. molecular biomarkers and network bio-
markers, are designed to distinguish disease samples from normal samples
(Liu et al., 2013a, b, c). For example, a molecule is taken as a biomarker if
its abundance (or expression) is signiﬁcantly higher or lower in the disease
state than in the normal state, thereby reﬂecting the severity or presence
of the illness in the disease state (Supplementary Fig. Sla). On the other
hand, the DNB scheme aims to distinguish pre-disease samples from
normal samples according to the correlations and ﬂuctuations of DNB
molecules (Supplementary Fig. Sla, b, d and e) (Liu et al., 2013a, b, c).
In other words, the DNB method aims to screen out a group of strongly
correlated and wildly ﬂuctuating molecules, which are also called ‘the
leading network’ (Liu et al., 2012) because those molecules may together
make the ﬁrst move to lead the whole system from the normal state to the
disease state.

Although elucidating the critical transition at the network level holds
the key to understanding the fundamental mechanism of disease devel-
opment and progression, it is notably hard to reliably identify the pre-
disease state because there are few apparent differences between the
normal and pre-disease states (Fig. la); note that a pre-disease state is
still a normal state, i.e. it is the limit of the normal state just before the
disease state. This is also the reason why diagnosis based on traditional
biomarkers may fail to indicate the pre-disease state (Supplementary
Fig. Slc). The theoretical basis for the DNB is summarized by the fol-
lowing conditions, which have been proved to hold simultaneously when
the system approaches the pre-disease state (see Supplementary Material
A for details):

(l) The deviation of a group of molecules, called the DNB from the
property of the whole population, drastically increases, i.e. the
ﬂuctuation condition.

(2) The average correlation between any two molecules in the DNB
increases, i.e. the correlation or internal connection condition.

(3) The average correlation between any molecule in the DNB and
another in the non-DNB decreases, i.e. the correlation or external
connection condition.

(4) There are no signiﬁcant changes in the deviations and correlations
of molecules among the remaining molecules of the system, i.e. the
non-DNB.

The above four conditions together deﬁne the DNB. The DNB genes
can be detected by the algorithms (Chen et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013a, b, 0)
based on the above conditions, but in this work we assume that DNB genes
are available for each disease (see Supplementary Materials D and E for
cross-validation tests), by which we further identify the pre-disease state
with a single sample. Dynamics satisfying the preceding conditions can be
viewed as local herding behavior, i.e. members in a group or subnetwork
act together without planned direction (or show strongly correlated

ﬂuctuation in the whole group). These conditions imply an imminent
regime shift or phase transition, and therefore, are used in DNB theory
to signal the emergence of the critical transition. Such a phenomenon can
also be described as a condition where all the DNB molecules become
dynamically correlated or connected so that the system can be reorganized
or reconnected in a different way or regime (state).

However, directly applying the above conditions requires multiple
samples from an individual who may not even have clinic disease symp-
toms, which restricts the clinic application. Next, we derive a new criter-
ion, i.e. the DNB-S score from a single sample by exploring interaction
information from high-throughput data based on the above conditions,
which can compensate for the insufficient samples.

2.2 Differential distributions by K—L divergence

From the theoretical result of DNB, DNB molecules are typically expected
to have a double-peak distribution in the pre-disease state due to their
signiﬁcant differential expression and strongly correlated ﬂuctuation
nature (conditions 173), but non-DNB molecules have a single-peak dis-
tribution even in the pre-disease state due to their stable behavior (condi-
tion 4) (see Supplementary Material A for details). On the other hand, in
the normal state, both the DNB and non-DNB molecules have single-peak
distributions due to their dynamically stable behavior (Fig. 1). These dif-
ferential distributions between DNB and non-DNB molecules and be-
tween DNB molecules of normal and pre-disease states can be identiﬁed
from a single sample provided that there are multiple control samples,
which are generally available in practice. In this article, we use the KiL
divergence, which measures the difference between two data-distribution
patterns to formulate the DNB-S score based on three factors (Fig. 1).

For two discrete probability distributions P and Q, i.e. those of DNB
molecules or non-DNB molecules with normalized values, the KiL
divergence of Q from P is deﬁned as

P(k)

D (HQ): 1(—)P(k). (1)
M 2,: “ Q(k)

where P(k) = Prob P(x = xk) and Q(k) = Pron(y = yk) with
ZP(k) = 1 and ZQUC) = 1.
k k

In an information theory context (Cover et al., 2005), KiL divergence
is actually the relative entropy, i.e.

DKL(Pa Q) = H(P, Q) - H(P), (2)

where H(P, Q) is the cross entropy of P and Q, and is related to the
information lost in P if only Q is known. DKL(P, Q) is zero only when
the distribution P is identical with Q, and is positive otherwise.

The KiL divergence was originally proposed for measuring the differ-
ence between two data distributions (Kullback et al., 1968, 1987) and fur-
ther extended to serve as a theoretical basis for data differencing (Shamilov
and Giriftinoglu, 2010), outlier detection (Oh et al., 2008) and evaluating
sample similarity (Lindorff-Larsen and Ferkinghoff-Borg, 2009; Zhou and
Chellappa, 2006). Assuming that PA and PB are two datasets, respectively,
for variables or measurements in two samples (A, B), if the score D 1“(P A,
P3) is zero, then the two samples represent the same amount of informa-
tion, thereby possessing the most similarity. During the progression of a
complex disease, if the KiL divergence of two samples is very small, then it
is natural to regard that the stages from which the samples are derived are
very similar. Thus, the KiL divergence is a natural choice for comparing
two samples with a number of measurements.

2.3 Data processing and algorithm

Three gene-expression-proﬁling datasets were downloaded from the NCBI
GEO database (ID: GSE2565, GSE13009, GSE30550) (wwwncbinlm.
nih.gov/geo). In these datasets, probe sets without corresponding gene

symbols were not considered in our analysis. The expression values of
probe sets mapped to the same gene were averaged. Genes in the DNBs
for the three diseases were linked and correlated based on combined func-
tional coupling information from various databases of proteiniprotein
interactions such as STRING, FunCoup and BioGrid.

In each disease dataset, expression proﬁling information was individu-
ally mapped to the integrated networks to identify the corresponding
DNB. For each species, we downloaded biomolecular interaction net-
works from various databases, including BioGrid (www.thebiogrid.org),
TRED (www.rulai.cshl.edu/cgi-bin/TRED/), KEGG (www.genome.jp/
kegg) and HPRD (www.hprd.org). First, the available functional linkage
information for Mus musculus and Homo sapiens was downloaded from
these databases and combined. For instance, after removing any redun-
dancy, we obtained 37950 linkages in 6683 mouse proteins/genes for
acute lung injury. Next, the genes evaluated in these microarray datasets
were mapped individually to their integrated functional linkage networks.
For the inﬂuenza dataset, gene-expression proﬁles were obtained and
measured on whole peripheral blood drawn from all subjects at an inter-
val of 8h post inoculation (hpi) through 108 hpi. A total of 267 gene
microarrays were obtained for all subjects at 16 time points, including the
baseline (224 hpi). Networks were visualized using Cytoscape (www.
cytoscape.org). Besides, the dataset for breast cancer was obtained in
an experiment on the MCF-7 cell line with HRG stimulation. The algo-
rithm of the DNB-S score and its application to the three real datasets are
described in Supplementary Materials C and D.

2.4 Functional analysis

As described in Supplementary Material D, we performed pathway-en-
richment analysis and -functional analysis for the identiﬁed DNBs of the
three diseases. The full list of DNBs is provided in the Supplementary
Table ‘Identiﬁed DNBs’.

3 RESULTS

We use a single sample with high-throughput data, e. g. genomics
or proteomics data, to identify the pre-disease state or early warn-
ing signal of a disease based on the DNB-S score. Achieving such a
reliable diagnosis is of great importance in clinic application since
one sample can be obtained much more easily than multiple sam-
ples for each individual who does not yet exhibit any disease symp-
toms during the short period before the critical transition.

3.1 Identifying the pre-disease state from a single sample

By exploring the dynamical properties of the underlying system
near a critical point, we are in a position to design a computa-
tional method for identifying the pre—disease state based on a
single case sample. First, remember that there are two groups
of variables in the high-throughput data in a single sample, i.e. a
group of DNB members and a group of non-DNB members (or
the remaining molecules except DNB members in the system).
We deﬁne the DNB-S score to identify the pre-disease state when
only a single case sample is available (see Supplementary
Material A). Speciﬁcally, given a single case sample, a number
of control samples (or normal samples) and the identiﬁed DNB,
we can construct a composite index I for the pre—disease state
based on the differential distributions between the case sample
and the control samples:

I _ DKL(CaseDNBs COHUOIDNB) X DKL(CaseDNBs CasenoniDNB)
8 + DKL(CasenoniDNBs COHtrOlﬂOﬂiDNB)

 

(3)

which is called the DNB single-sample score (DNB-S score).
Here, 8 is a small positive number to avoid zero division. We
require a number of control samples to obtain a stable back-
ground distribution. Owing to the nature of the DNB (conditions
174), when the system approaches the pre-disease state from the
normal state, the terms of the DNB-S score (3) have the follow-
ing features:

0 The KiL divergence of the case sample and the control
samples of the DNB, i.e. DKL(caseDNB, controlDNB) in-
creases due to high differential distributions of the DNB
members between the case sample and the control samples,
i.e. DNB molecules are typically expected to have a double-
peak distribution in the pre-disease state, which is com-
pletely different from the single-peak distribution of DNB
molecules in the normal state (as demonstrated in the
numerical simulation in Fig. 2c).

0 The KiL divergence of the case sample between DNB and
non-DNB molecules, i.e. DKL(caseDNB, casen0n_DNB) in-
creases due to high differential distributions between DNB
members and non-DNB, i.e. DNB molecules are typically
expected to have a double-peak distribution in the pre-
disease state, which is completely different from the single-
peak distribution of non-DNB molecules in the pre-disease
state (as shown in Fig. 2d).

Clearly, the above two terms in the criterion are mainly used to
detect the pre-disease state. On the other hand, when the system
moves to the disease state after passing the pre-disease state, the
third term of the DNB-S score (3) has the following feature:

0 The KiL divergence of the case sample and the control
samples of non-DNB, i.e. DKL(casen0n_DNB, controln0n_
DNB) has no signiﬁcant change in both the normal and
pre-disease states, but usually increases in the disease state
due to differential distributions of non-DNB members be-
tween case and control samples in the disease state, i.e. non-
DNB molecules are typically expected to exhibit similar
single-peak distributions in both normal and pre-disease
states, but have different average values or distributions
for normal and disease samples.

Different from the pre-disease and normal states, significant
differences between the disease and normal states are expected
(from the third feature). Thus, the KiL divergence between case
and control samples of non-DNB usually increases in the disease
state, resulting in a low level of the DNB-S score. Therefore, the
third term in the criterion also contributes to distinguish between
the disease state and the pre—disease state. However, the pre-
disease state can be detected mainly by the ﬁrst two terms in
the criterion.

Integrating the above properties, we can detect the pre-disease
state based on a single case sample by the DNB-S score (3); that
is, if the criterion (3) is much higher than a threshold, then the
case sample is diagnosed as being in the pre-disease state.
Actually, the combined criterion from the three terms also re-
duces the effects of noise and data errors, and thus improves the
sensitivity for detecting the critical information in a pre-disease
sample.

differences. (c) and ((1) present the two important terms of the DNB-S

3.2 Numerical experiments

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the DNB-S score, we used a
theoretical model of a 16-node network (Fig. 2a) to generate data
for each subject or sample. Data for ﬁve single-sample subjects
were generated and used for validation. Detailed descriptions of
the network represented by a set of stochastic differential equa-
tions are provided in Supplementary Material B, and the results
of numerical experiments are provided in Figure 2. In particular,
we obtained the following results.

0 When the system is near the critical point (i.e. the parameter
P approaches the critical value 0), the DNB-S score (or the
two terms in the nominator of the criterion) is in a high level
or well above the threshold line (Fig. 2b).

0 When the system passes the critical point and is in the dis-
ease state (i.e. the parameter P is negative), the term in the
denominator of the composite index is at a high level, which
results in a lower value of the DNB-S score.

The numerical experiment validates that the DNB-S score is
reliable and accurate in identifying the pre-disease state and thus
provides the early warning signal of a catastrophic change in the
system. Besides, the state changes of the system for all nodes are
also presented in Figure 3, from which it can be seen that the
DNB group, i.e. a dominant group composed by nodes 21,
22, . . . , Z7, shows a clear early warning signal by their coordinated
dynamic behavior in a collective manner. Note that there is no
clear signal to detect the imminent transition from a single
variable (or a few variables) due to the noise (or stochastic
ﬂuctuations) of the original biological system (Fig. 3), which

Fig. 3. States of the l6-node network with changing the value of the
parameter P. The expression values of the 16 nodes (or state variables)
under different values of the parameter P are shown in the graphs.
Clearly (i) there are random ﬂuctuations for each node far before the
critical transition due to noise; (ii) there are no signiﬁcant changes for any
non-DNB node, e.g. 28, 29, . . . , 216, before the critical transition. Thus, a
traditional scheme (e.g. critical slowing-down) based on only one or a few
variables cannot correctly signal the pre-disease state. In other words,
based on the integration of the collective dynamics of a subnetwork,
the DNB, i.e., z], 22, . . . , Z7 (the graphs in left column), is expected to
provide reliable and correct early warning signals in the pre-disease state,
i.e. the expressions of DNB members increasingly ﬂuctuate in a collective
manner as the system approaches the critical point

demonstrates the advantage of exploiting high-dimensional in-
formation using the DNB scheme. In other words, if there is no
detailed model for a biological system, generally we do not know
which variable can reﬂect the critical change of the system so as
to measure it. As shown in this example, given high-throughput
data or high-dimensional information, the DNB-S score provides
a way to detect the signal for diagnosing the pre-disease state
even without a detailed model.

3.3 Application to three diseases

We further applied the DNB-S score to three diseases using high-
throughput real data, i.e. microarray data for live inﬂuenza in-
fection (humans) caused by H3N2 Virus (GSE30550), acute lung
injury (rats) induced by carbonyl chloride inhalation exposure
(GSE2565) and MCF-7 human breast cancer caused by here-
gulin (HRG) (GSE13009). The detailed algorithm and data de-
scriptions are presented in Supplementary Materials C and D,
respectively. It is worth mentioning that although time series
data are available for each of the three diseases, we identiﬁed
the pre-disease states in one data point at a time independently,
i.e. using a single sample in each identiﬁcation. Figures 4P6 show
the identified pre-disease states just before the critical deterior-
ations based on the DNB-S score, which agrees well with the
observed biological phenotypes described in the original datasets
(Huang et al., 2011; Saeki et al., 2009; Sciuto et al., 2005).
Speciﬁcally, Figure 4 shows the DNB-S scores for live inﬂuenza
infection of 17 subjects (17 humans), in which nine subjects were
diagnosed as having inﬂuenza infection or clinic symptoms
(symptomatic subjects) 45 h later and eight subjects were classiﬁed
as non-symptoms (asymptomatic subjects) during the whole study
period (Huang et al., 2011). Figure 4a shows the clinic symptoms
(S) and non-symptoms (N) among the 17 subjects with live inﬂu-
enza infection based on real clinic tests. In Figure 4b, we identiﬁed

inﬂuenza infection in 17 humans using a real biomedical dataset. (a) The
clinic symptoms (S) and non-symptoms (N) at different time points
among the 17 subjects with live inﬂuenza infection based on real clinic
tests. (b)-(c) show the DNB-S scores of nine single-sample symptomatic
subjects (humans) and eight asymptomatic subjects (humans) for inﬂu-
enza infection resulting from H3N2 virus. The pre-disease states or pre-
symptom for inﬂuenza infection occurred around 29h (i.e. 29, 36 and
45 h), whereupon the DNB-S scores became respectively higher than the
threshold shown in (b). All symptomatic subjects were correctly identiﬁed
before the clinical diagnosis of the disease state (b), whereas all asymp-
tomatic subjects showed no signals of the pre-disease states and were also
correctly classiﬁed (c). (d) The dynamic changes in the molecular network

edge represents the correlation between two nodes. It can be seen
that at 29 h, there is a strong signal to indicate the pre-disease state or

the pre-disease states (early diagnosed pre-symptom) of nine
symptomatic subjects before the appearance of clinic symptoms,
while our DNB-S scores indicated the absence of pre-
disease states for the other eight asymptomatic subjects shown

ively from 29 to 45 h, which are well before the earliest clinic
symptom that appeared at 45 h for the nine symptomatic subjects

by heregulin (HRG) based on a single sample. In this ﬁgure, the pre-
disease state is identiﬁed as being ~2 h, at which both of the DNB-S
scores are higher than the threshold (blue line). Both the case samples
and case subjects were correctly identiﬁed before the serious deteriorated
disease state

based on the original clinic tests, thereby validating our method
and the pre-disease states (see Fig. 4a). Hence, our early diagnoses
agree with the original results ﬂ-Iuang et al., 2011). In addition, a
ﬁgure illustrating dynamic changes of the whole molecular net-
work of a single-sample subject (i.e. Subject 1) from 0 to 45h is
shown in Figure 4d, where a strong signal for the pre-disease state
can be observed at 29 h, and a complete representation of all the
three terms in the DNB-S score is provided as Supplementary
Figure S10. From Figure 4a, it can be seen that for all the nine
symptomatic subjects, the DNB-S score is higher in the pre-
disease states and thus detects the early warning signal of the
deterioration before clinic symptoms could be observed, whereas
the DNB-S score correctly shows no signals for eight clinic
asymptotic subjects. It can be seen that the pre-disease stages
for Subjects 8, 10, 12, 13 and 15 are longer than those for
Subjects 1, 5, 6 and 7. Furthermore, there are multiple critical
stages (pre-disease states) for Subjects 12, 13 and 15, which may

Identifying critical transitions by a single sample

 

represent multiple deterioration processes for these three subjects.
Actually, there is an approximate 24h interval for these three
critical stages, i.e. 36—> 60—> 84 h, which may be related to the
immune responses of the three subjects before the eventual defeat
to the disease state; the analyses of their mechanisms will be con-
sidered as a future research topic.

Figure 5a shows the DNB-S scores for six single case subjects
of acute lung injury, where between 1 and 12h, the DNB-S
scores were all above the threshold line. Therefore, we identiﬁed
the pre-disease state at ~4 h. In the original experiment, a
5&60% mortality was routinely observed after 12h and a
6&70% mortality was observed after 24h (Sciuto et al., 2005).
The major deterioration on average thus emerges ~24h (the 7th
sampling time point). It can be seen from Figure 5a that the
DNB-S scores are well above the threshold line at 4 and 8h,
which indicates the pre-disease state before the critical point at
24h. Moreover, all control samples correctly show no signal
based on the DNB-S score (Fig. 5b). Therefore, using a single
case sample, the DNB-S score is able to identify the pre-disease
state, which is consistent with our previous results (Chen et al.,
2012; Liu et al., 2012) and the observed experimental results
(Sciuto et al., 2005). The curves for the three terms in the criter-
ion are provided in Supplementary Figure S8.

Figure 6 shows the DNB-S scores for two single-sample sub-
jects of HRG-induced breast cancer, where the DNB-S scores are
all above the threshold line at 2h. Therefore, we identiﬁed the
pre-disease state in each case before 4h. In the original experi-
ment, the stimulation of MCF—7 breast cancer cells with epider-
mal growth factor and HRG resulted in very similar early
transcription proﬁles up to 90 min; however, subsequent cellular
phenotypes differed after 3 h (Saeki et al., 2009), which suggests
that the deterioration is ~3 h. These results are in agreement with
the original experimental results (Saeki et al., 2009). The curves
for the three terms in the composite index are provided in
Supplementary Figure S9.

The successful application of the DNB-S score in the three real
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in identify-
ing the pre-disease state and thus provide early diagnosis of crit-
ical transitions on the basis of just a single sample. The detailed
algorithm and data descriptions for the three diseases are pro-
vided in Supplementary Materials C and D, respectively. To val-
idate the effectiveness and accuracy of the identiﬁed DNBs as
well as the DNB-S score, leave-one-out cross-validation was car-
ried out and is provided in Supplementary Material E. The iden-
tiﬁed DNBs for the diseases are given in the Supplementary
Table ‘Identiﬁed DNBs’.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we developed a novel computational method, i.e.
the DNB-S scoring method, to identify the pre-disease state of a
disease on the basis of a single sample, which facilitates early
diagnosis before the disease state or its serious deterioration.
From the Viewpoints of both theoretical analysis and numerical
computation, we have demonstrated that the DNB-S score is
sensitive to any sample near the pre-disease state. All the results
show that we identiﬁed the pre-disease state, i.e. the state just
before a critical transition to the disease state, rather than the
disease state targeted by traditional biomarkers. By developing

this method, we also found that a single case-sample with high-
throughput measurements actually has enriched information suf-
ﬁcient for early diagnosis even if there is no reliable disease
model (i.e. the underlying mechanism of disease deterioration
is unclear). In other words, the DNB-S score is a model-free
approach, which is capable of exploiting high-dimensional infor-
mation (or interaction information on high-dimensional data)
and thus distinguishing pre-disease samples from normal ones.

Our study makes two main contributions. First, the DNB-S
score can identify the pre-disease state before moving into the
deteriorated disease state by a critical transition, rather than
diagnosing the disease state. Therefore, it has profound potential
to achieve ‘real’ early diagnosis for complex diseases. Second, the
DNB-S score can detect the pre-disease state with only a single
sample for each individual, which is of great importance for
clinic applications in realistic cases such as clinic testing
and personalized healthcare. All the results show that high-
dimensional information of data can be used to compensate
for insufﬁcient samples, which is the major reason why the
DNB-S score can detect the pre-disease state from a single
high-throughput sample.

It is also worth noting that this method is based on the DNB
theory and thus the molecules in the DNB can be related to the
leading network of the disease. Those molecules may make the
ﬁrst move from the normal state toward the disease state through
a critical transition, and thus, be causally related to disease-
driVing genes or networks. Therefore, the DNB-S score can be
a reﬂection of the leading factors (the driving network or disease-
driVing genes) to the serious deterioration of complex diseases. In
addition to the diagnosis of diseases, our method can be applied
to the analysis of other complex processes or phenomena in
biology, physics, ecology or even economics in a similar
manner provided that drastic state transitions are involved in
these processes, e.g. cell-differentiation and cell-cycle processes.

Abstract

Summary: We implemented a high—throughput identification pipeline for promoter interacting en—
hancer element to streamline the workflow from mapping raw Hi—C reads, identifying DNA—DNA
interacting fragments with high confidence and quality control, detecting histone modifications and
DNase hypersensitive enrichments in putative enhancer elements, to ultimately extracting possible
intra— and inter—chromosomal enhancer—target gene relationships.

Availability and implementation: This software package is designed to run on high—performance
computing clusters with Oracle Grid Engine. The source code is freely available under the MIT li—
cense for academic and nonprofit use. The source code and instructions are available at the Wang
lab website (http://wanglab.pcbi.upenn.edu/hippie/). It is also provided as an Amazon Machine
Image to be used directly on Amazon Cloud with minimal installation.

1 Introduction

Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) has been
utilized to reveal three-dimensional connectivity of chromatin re-
gions in eukaryotic nuclei (Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009). Because
of its capability to capture all possible chromatin interactions in a
genome, it has been recently employed to observe long-range regula-
tory elements with their geographically proximal target gene pro-
moters (Hwang et (11., 2013). Although there have been workflows
successfully expediting the analysis of one-dimensional high-
throughput sequencing results such as whole-exome sequencing,
ChIP-seq, DNase-seq and RNA-seq, there are limited tools to untan-
gle two-dimensional DNA—DNA physical interactions using Hi-C
datasets. In an effort to reduce the obstacle of processing these large-
scale datasets and to establish an analysis protocol to detect candi-
date long-range regulatory elements, we implemented an automated

workflow that processes Hi-C results starting from read mapping
with quality controls and corrects for biases in interactions based on
the linear distance, mappability, GC content and fragment lengths of
each pair of Hi-C reads. This pipeline identifies candidate promoter-
interacting enhancer elements by integrating Hi-C results with epige-
nomics data such as histone modifications and DNase hypersensitiv-
ity sites.

2 Materials and Methods

High-throughput identification pipeline for promoter interacting en-
hancer element (HIPPIE) takes Hi-C raw reads as the input and gen-
erates a list of enhancers with their interacting target genels) as the
output. We built HIPPIE with five step-wise phases (Fig. 1): (i) read
mapping, (ii) quality control, (iii) identification of significant

single reads) from the Illumina GA 11 platform (GEO accessions
GSM862723 and GSM892306). The total CPU time required for
HIPPIE to process these datasets is 437.26 core hours. The break—
down of CPU time for each phase is as follows: read mapping:
64.4%, quality control: 5.8%, identification of peaks: 26.8%, en—
hancer—target gene interaction prediction: 2.8% and characteriza—
tion: 0.1%. The maximum memory usage is 4.77G for read
mapping. We identified 3,707 CEEs with 3,190 targeted RefSeq
genes.

4 Comparison with other tools

While there are publicly available pipelines for processing Hi—C
reads, there are no open—source software packages that take raw
reads as input and ultimately identify enhancer—target gene pairs
along with their interaction characteristics (Table 1). Among them,
Hicpipe takes mapped reads and corrects the contact maps based on
possible experimental biases (Yaffe and Tanay, 2011). HiC—in—
spector aligns reads and generates a contact matrix with user—defined
read densities but does not have statistical filtering steps for the iden—
tified fragments (https://github.com/HiC—inspector). HiCUP maps
reads with filtering out artifacts and self—interacting reads without
any statistical model (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/
projects/hicup/). None of those identify long—range regulatory elem—
ents nor provide error checking.

Abstract

Summary: Many cell lines can be reprogrammed to other cell lines by forced expression of a few
transcription factors or by specifically designed culture methods, which have attracted a great
interest in the field of regenerative medicine and stem cell research. Plenty of cell lines have been
used to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (lPSCs) by expressing a group of genes and
microRNAs. These lPSCs can differentiate into somatic cells to promote tissue regeneration.
Similarly, many somatic cells can be directly reprogrammed to other cells without a stem cell state.
All these findings are helpful in searching for new reprogramming methods and understanding the
biological mechanism inside. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no database
dedicated to integrating the reprogramming records. We built Rde (cellular reprogramming data—
base) to collect cellular reprogramming information and make it easy to access. All entries in Rde
are manually extracted from more than 2000 published articles, which is helpful for researchers in
regenerative medicine and cell biology.

1 Introduction

Cellular reprogramming is a process in which one cell type trans-
forms into another cell type by expressing a group of genes and
microRNAs, adding chemical molecules or changing cell culture en-
vironment (Hussein and Nagy, 2012). Cellular reprogramming tech-
nology, which mainly includes induced pluripotent stem cell (IPSC)
generation, IPSC differentiation and direct reprogramming, is con-
sidered one of the most important advances in tissue replacement
therapies (Tabar and Studer, 2014; Walmsley et (11., 2014). Somatic
cells can be reprogramed to a stem cell-like state, which can differen-
tiate to functional somatic cells. Multiple somatic cells, including
blood cells (Giorgetti et (11., 2009), fibroblasts (Takahashi et (11.,
2007) and hair follicle dermal papilla cells (Tsai et (11., 2011) have

been successfully reprogrammed to IPSCs. There are also many
functional somatic cells that have been generated from IPSCs, such
as dopaminergic neurons (Theka et (11., 2013) and retinal cells
(Mellough et (11., 2012). Multiple strategies have been used to
achieve these goals, including chemical-inducible systems (Nie et (11.,
2012), virus-free transfection, recombinant proteins and
microRNAs (Walmsley et (11., 2014). Using similar strategies, vari-
ous somatic cells have been directly converted into other cell types,
which are named direct reprogramming or transdifferentiation.
Although there are several steni-cell-focused databases, such as
SyStemCell (Yu et (11., 2012) and StemCellDB (Mallon et (11., 2013),
to the best of our knowledge, there is no database that focuses on
comprehensively collecting and analyzing cellular reprogramming

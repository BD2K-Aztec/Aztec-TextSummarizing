Abstract

Motivation: Molecular recognition of N—terminal targeting peptides is the most common mechan—
ism controlling the import of nuclear—encoded proteins into mitochondria and chloroplasts. When
experimental information is lacking, computational methods can annotate targeting peptides, and
determine their cleavage sites for characterizing protein localization, function, and mature protein
sequences. The problem of discriminating mitochondrial from chloroplastic propeptides is particu—
larly relevant when annotating proteomes of photosynthetic Eukaryotes, endowed with both types
of sequences.

Results: Here, we introduce TPpred3, a computational method that given any Eukaryotic protein
sequence performs three different tasks: (i) the detection of targeting peptides; (ii) their classifica—
tion as mitochondrial or chloroplastic and (iii) the precise localization of the cleavage sites in an
organelle—specific framework. Our implementation is based on our TPpred previously introduced.
Here, we integrate a new N—to—1 Extreme Learning Machine specifically designed for the classifica—
tion task (ii). For the last task, we introduce an organelle—specific Support Vector Machine that
exploits sequence motifs retrieved with an extensive motif—discovery analysis of a large set of mito—
chondrial and chloroplastic proteins. We show that TPpred3 outperforms the state—of—the—art meth—
ods in all the three tasks.

1 Introduction

 

transit peptides. Routinely these signals are located in the

The vast majority of proteins localized in mitochondria and chloro-
plasts are nuclear-encoded and synthesized by the cytoplasmic ribo-
somes. Then, they target the different organelles with the aid of
specific and different molecular machineries, still partially character-
ized. One of most common ones requires the interaction between
the import system and specific sequence signals, called targeting or

N-terminal region of the native protein sequence. Different proteo-
lytic enzymes cleave targeting peptides upon protein translocation
across organelle membranes. The recognition and annotation of
targeting peptides starting from protein sequence assumes an
important role in the characterization of the protein sub-cellular
localization and function. For this reason, over the past years,

several computational approaches have been described to address
this task.

Some of the available tools are organelle—specific, such as
ChloroP (Emanuelsson et al., 1999) and MitoProt (Claros and
Vincens, 1996), specialized on chloroplasts and mitochondria,
respectively. Both are able to detect the presence of targeting
peptides and to predict the position of the cleavage site along
the sequence. Other tools, such as TargetP (Emanuelsson et al.,
2000), iPSORT (Bannai et al., 2002), Predotar (Small et al., 2004),
PredSL (Petsalaki et al., 2006), can predict both the presence
of a targeting peptide and the localization of the protein.
Only PredSL and TargetP, however, perform a prediction of the
cleavage site.

Recently, we introduced TPpred (Indio et al., 2013), a method
based on Grammatical—Restrained Hidden Conditional Random
Fields (GRHCRF) predicting the presence of targeting peptides and
the localization of cleavage sites in both mitochondrial and chloro—
plastic proteins. TPpred, however, does not address the task of dis—
criminating the subcellular localization on the basis of the targeting
peptide. TPpred2.0 (Savojardo et al., 2014) was introduced in order
to improve the prediction of cleavage sites in mitochondrial pro—
teins. It exploits the information extracted from sequence motifs
known in literature and particularly frequent in the regions contain—
ing the cleavage sites of mitochondrial targeting peptides
(Mossmann et al., 2012; Savojardo et al., 2014).

In this article, we introduce TPpred3, a comprehensive and inte—
grated pipeline to address the prediction of organelle—targeting pep—
tides in Eukaryotic proteins, and particularly in green ones. Indeed
in photosynthetic Eukaryotes, targeting peptides should be differ—
ently recognized by the import machinery in order to address both
mitochondria and chloroplasts.

Our method is organized into three different modules, which col—
lectively accomplish the following tasks: (i) the detection of the tar—
geting signal in the N—terminal region of the protein; (ii) the
classification of the identified signal as mitochondrial or chloroplas—
tic; (iii) the precise identification of the targeting—peptide cleavage
site in an organelle—specific manner.

For the first task (detection of the targeting signal), we rely on
our previously developed method, called TPpred (Indio et al., 2013),
which is based on a discriminative probabilistic sequence—labeling
model (Fariselli et al., 2009).

The detected targeting peptide is then classified into two classes
(mitochondrial or chloroplastic) by means of an N—t0—1 Extreme
Learning Machine (ELM) model, an architecture of artificial neural
networks specifically suited to address classification problems
involving sequences (Savojardo et al., 2011). Finally, a refining pro—
cedure is applied in order to better localize the cleavage site. This
final task is addressed by means of two organelle—specific Support
Vector Machines (SVMs) that exploit information derived from
organelle—specific sequence motifs surrounding the cleavage sites.
We extracted them with an extensive motif—discovery analysis car—
ried out on two datasets of experimentally validated mitochondrial
and chloroplastic targeting peptides.

We trained and tested the whole pipeline on a non—redundant
dataset of proteins previously released to test TPpred and TPpred2
(Indio et al., 2013; Savojardo et al., 2014) and generated a different
dataset for motif discovery.

Our results show that TPpred3 outperforms previous approaches
in the task of predicting organelle—targeting peptides. In particular,
by exploiting organelle—specific motifs, it is possible to reduce the
error in the exact identification of the cleavage site in both mito—
chondrial and chloroplastic protein sequences.

2 Methods

2.1 Dataset for targeting—peptide prediction

For training and testing our method we adopted the non—redundant
dataset described by Indio et al. (2013) and used to benchmark
TPpred2.0 (Savojardo et al., 2014). We refer to this dataset as the
Cleavage Prediction Set (CPS). It contains sequences extracted from
UniprotKB/SwissProt (release November 2011), sharing <30%
sequence identity.

Briefly, CPS includes 8307 proteins, with a positive subset
(proteins annotated with an experimental targeting peptide) and a
negative subset (proteins without targeting peptide). The positive set
comprises 297 proteins, 202 of which are localized into mitochon—
dria (M set) and 95 into chloroplasts (C set). The negative set
includes 8010 proteins (N set) (Indio et al., 2013). When considering
only proteins from photosynthetic Eukaryotic organisms, the CPS
restricted (CPSr) set includes 718 proteins, of which 18 are in M, 95
in C and the remaining 605 in N.

2.2 Datasets for motif discovery in the cleavage site of
mitochondrial and chloroplastic sequences

The datasets for motif discovery were generated downloading pro—
teins with an experimentally detected targeting peptide (and a clear
cleavage site), released after November 2011 up to April 2014, and
complementing CPS. All the proteins with >40% sequence identity
to CPS were filtered out. We ended up with 453 mitochondrial
(Mit0453) and 198 chloroplastic proteins (Chlor0198), respectively.

Table 1 lists the major features of the two sets. In Mit045 3, 34
(7%) proteins in Mit0453 proteins are from plants and 12 (~3%)
are from protists [Dictyostelium discoideum (six proteins),
Trypanosoma brucei (three proteins), Euglena gracilis (one protein),
Leis/amam'a tarentolae (one protein), Tetra/aymena thermophila (one
protein)].

Proteins in the Chlor0198 dataset are almost entirely from
Viridiplantae organisms (96% as shown in Table 1), with the excep—
tion of seven proteins that are from non—Viridiplantae organisms
such as Euglena gracilis (2), Amp/aidinium carteme (2),
Rhodomonas species (1), Odontella sinensis (1), Corallina officinalis
(1).

As expected, mitochondrial targeting peptides are in general
shorter than the chloroplastic ones (Table 1, bottom row). In par—
ticular, average lengths of targeting peptides are of 35 and 55 resi—
dues, respectively in mitochondrial and chloroplastic sequences.

2.3 Overview of TPpred3

Our approach for the prediction and classification of targeting pep—
tides in Eukaryotic proteins is outlined in Figure 1. It includes our
previously released TPpred predictor (Indio et al., 2013) with two
additional modules newly introduced in order to analyze a given
input sequence in an organelle—specific manner.

set comprising N examples, with the ‘desired’ target class values
stored in the N—by—2 matrix T, a N—by—K hidden—layer output matrix
H is firstly computed as follows:

H: lhi.  .hﬁf (3)

The i—th row of this matrix represents the non—linear encoding h,
into the hidden layer of the network of the i—th training input
example. The weights connecting the hidden and the output layers

of the network ([3) are analytically determined using a least—squares
approach:

is: H‘lT (4)

where H'1 is the pseudo—inverse of the H matrix.

The ELM approach gives better results than traditional gradient—
based training algorithms (Huang et al., 2006). Furthermore, the
ELM algorithm simplifies and speeds—up the network training by
avoiding the tuning of several hyper—parameters (e.g. learning rates,
number of epochs, momentum etc.) that are present in gradient—
based approaches.

The two parameters of the N—t0—1 method 1’ and K were selected
by performing a grid search procedure. Here, their final optimized
values are 27 and 54, for r and K, respectively.

As showed in previous studies, the N—to—1 ELM framework is
well—suited for structured classification involving variable—length
input sequences, particularly in problems where it is not easy to
extract relevant features from the input. N—t0—1 ELM leverages the
entire information contained in the input sequences to solve the clas—
sification task (Savojardo et al., 2011).

2.3.3 The cleavage site refinement modules

Depending on the classification TPCM output (Section 2.3.2),
targeting peptides are directed to the corresponding organelle—
specific CSRM (one for mitochondrial and one for chloroplastic
targeting peptides, CSRMs in Fig. 1). Here, the cleavage site is
refined taking advantage of the presence of organelle—specific
sequence motifs in the neighborhood of the cleavage site. Motifs are
found as described in Section 2.3.4 and are different for mitochon—
drial and chloroplastic targeting peptides. Both CSRMs include
a first step that scores the presence of a given motif and a second
step for refinement using SVMs. CSRMs analyze a
region comprising 29 and 45 residues centered respectively on the
mitochondrial and the chloroplastic TPpred predicted cleavage
site. Each of the residues is scored for motif occurrence as detailed
below.

2.3.3.1 Scoring (1 motifoccurrence. In what follows, let:
MO={M‘1’7  7M2} (5)

be the set of n motifs found through motif discovery for the organ—
elle o.

For a given sequence position i, the pattern of occurrence Po‘i of
the motif set M0 is detected with a nine—residue window centered at
i, and it is a binary n—by—9 matrix such that:

(6)

1 iff motif M: occurs at position i + i
0 otherwise

Where/ is in the range [—4,+4] and r in the range [1,n]. For this
operation, we use the program FIMO (Grant et al., 2011) of the
MEME Suite (Bailey et al., 2009).

From each matrix P‘” the following cleavage site propensity
score is then computed for the position i:

S.- : 2 PS; X f... (7)

hi

where fr), is the frequency of occurrence of the motif 1’ in position i.
The offset / is defined with respect to the real cleavage sites. fr), is
used to weight the motif occurrence. The rationale behind this
weighting scheme relies on the fact that motif occurrence is not uni—
formly distributed in the cleavage—site environment. Indeed, patterns
have different distributions with respect to the position of the real
cleavage site. Frequencies fr), are estimated from training sets on
experimentally detected cleavage sites and are adopted to compute
the propensity score of both training and testing sets.

2.3.3.2 SVM implementation. Two organelle—specific SVMs were
trained and tested for the refinement of the cleavage site. This step
was performed in a region of width 29 and 45 residues for mito—
chondrial and chloroplastic proteins, respectively. For each residue
in this region the following descriptors were computed and used as
input to SVMs:

° the marginal posterior probability (computed by TPpred) of the
cleavage site occurring at the given residue position;

° the marginal posterior probability (computed by TPpred) that
the given residue is part of a targeting peptide;

° the cleavage site propensity score (Equation 8) of the given resi—
due position computed from the organelle—specific motif set.

For the training phase, the above descriptors were computed
considering only the experimentally detected cleavage sites and their
closest residues regions. In testing, TPpred—predicted sites and their
environments were adopted.

2.3.4 Discovery of cleavage site motifs

We carried—out an extensive motif—discovery analysis with the aim of
finding characteristic sequence motifs in the regions surrounding the
cleavage sites. We ran two separate analyses: one for mitochondrial
and one for chloroplastic proteins, using Mit045 3 and Chlor0198 as
reference sets, respectively. We used MEME (Bailey and Elkan, 1994)
and FIMO (Grant et al., 2011) of the MEME Suite (Bailey et al.,
2009) as baseline motif discovery tools in protein sequences. Our pro—
cedure includes five different steps described in the following.

2.3.4.1 Five-fold cross-validation procedure. Both reference sets of
protein sequences (either the Mit0453 or the Chlor0189) were div—
ided into five cross—validation subsets. In defining these subsets, we
took care of confining similar sequences into the same subset. The
CD—HIT program (Fu et al., 2012) was used to calculate sequence
clusters at 40% sequence identity. Then, proteins in the same cluster
were assigned to the same cross—validation subset. For each cross—
validation run, four of the five subsets were used to define the Motif
Discovery Set (MDS), while the remaining one was used to build the
Motif Validation Set (MVS). MDS was used to perform the actual
motif—discovery analysis using MEME, while the MVS was used as
hold—out set in order to validate the found motifs.

2.3.4.2 Building positive and negative sets. We extracted from pro—
teins included in MDS, nine—residue long segments centered on the
cleavage sites. The value 9 was set after maximizing the prediction
accuracy in cross—validation. All together, these segments formed the

organelle—specific positive Motif Discovering Set (MDS+). We refer
to each of these segments as the Cleavage Site Environment (CSE) of
a given protein sequence.

For building an organelle—specific negative MDS (MDS—), we
applied the following procedure. For each sequence in the MDS set,
we extracted all 9—mer centered on non—cleavage sites, excluding
those that overlapped with any CSEs. All 9—mer were ranked accord—
ing to their sequence identities with the CSEs of their sequence of
origin. We formed the final MDS— by choosing the 1000 top—
ranking sites. The same procedure was applied to generate MVSs
(MVS+ and MVS—, positive and negative, respectively).

2.3.4.3 Discriminative motif discovery using MEME. Both the
MDS+ and the MDS— were used to perform discriminative motif
discovery using MEME. First, we estimated a Position—Specific Prior
(PSP) model using the PSP—GEN program (Bailey et al., 2010) of the
MEME suite. A PSP model scores the likelihood that a motif starts
at a particular position in the sequences included in the MDS+ input
set (Bailey et al., 2010). In this way, we identify motifs that are rep—
resentative of cleavage—site regions and under—represented in the
remaining part of the sequences.

The generated PSP model was then provided as input to MEME
along with the MDS+ set. The MEME program was executed using
different settings for the input parameters (width of motifs ranging
from 4 to 9; minimum number of motif occurrences ranging from
25 to 60% of the MDS+ set). In order to identify only significant
motifs, the e—value threshold of the MEME program was set to 0.05.
Motifs found in all the MEME runs were finally collected into the
organelle—specific Initial Motif Sets (IMSs).

2.3.4.4 Motif validation, clustering and filtering. Motifs in the IMSs
were clustered and validated against the MVSs (Section 2.3.4.1).
Motif clustering was performed using average—linkage hierarchical
clustering. The distance measure derives from the alignment—free
method described by Xu and Su (2010), originally devised to com—
pare transcription factor binding sites. Briefly, for each motif in the
IMS we compiled a 400—valued vector, called Di—peptide Frequency
Vector (DFV), representing the di—peptide composition in the motif.
A distance measure between motifs equals the distance between
the corresponding DFVs (Xu and Su, 2010). Here, we used the
Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient distance (dpcc) computed as:

dpcc : 1 — PCC(V,-,V,-) (8)

where V; and V, are DFVs for motif i and /, respectively and
PCC(V,,V,) is the Pearson’s correlation of the two vectors.

Hierarchical clustering by average—linkage was then computed
from the motif distance matrix. Motif clusters were created by cut—
ting the resulting distance tree using a cut—off threshold of 0.75. By
this, motifs whose DFVs had a PCC higher than 0.25 ended—up into
the same cluster.

For each motif in a cluster we searched for the occurrences in the
MVS+ and MVS— sets, using the program FIMO (Grant et al., 2011)
setting the P—value threshold to 0.001, and we selected as representa—
tive of the cluster the motif scoring with the lowest false—positive rate.

All the selected motifs were then collected into the organelle—
specific Refined Motif Sets (RMSs).

2.4 Evaluation metrics

2.4.1 Evaluation of the classification procedure (TPCM)

With TPCM (in Fig. 1), for a given protein, its TPpred predicted tar—
geting peptide is classified into one of the two mithocondrial and

chloroplastic class. In the following, we describe the procedure
adopted for scoring the classification.

Let p,, n,, u,, o; be the number of positive correct, negative cor—

task with the results obtained with iPSORT (Bannai et al., 2002),

and PredSL (Petsalaki et al., 2006).

Table 2 lists the performance of the different methods on the
classification task on the whole CPS set (Section 2.1). It is important
to remark that we can guarantee a real cross validation procedure
only for our predictor and not for all the others. Predictors are used
without providing information on the source organism of the pro—
tein. All the methods in rows 2—5 have a higher recall: however
TPpred3 outperforms the other state—of—the—art methods, being
much less affected by false positives (higher P(M), P(C) and MCCs
than other methods in Table 2).

In Table 3, we benchmark all the methods towards proteins of
photosynthetic Eukaryotes (CPS reduced), where targeting peptides
of both mitochondrial and chloroplastic types coexist in the same
cytoplasm. Again, considering that only TPpred3 is tested adopting
a rigorous cross validation procedure, it appears that it outperforms
the other methods, being much less affected by false positives.

3.2 Motif discovery results

The motif discovery procedure retrieved two and three motifs
around the cleavage site for mitochondrial and chloroplastic pro—
teins, respectively. These motifs describe sequence patterns that are
frequently present in the regions surrounding the cleavage sites.
Motifs found by the MEME program are in the form of Position—
Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) whose regular expressions,
obtained by extracting the most frequent residues in each position,
are listed in Table 4. Sequence logos generated with the Seq2L0g0
program (Thomsen and Nielsen, 2012), show the relative frequency
of the different residues in the motifs and are available in

M, Mitochondrial and C, Chloroplastic motifs. We indicate in brackets ‘[]’
alternative choices and with the symbol ‘|’ the most frequent position for the
cleavage site when the PSSM are searched on the Mito453 and Chlor0198
sets (Section 2.2).

geting peptides, respectively. In other cases, the difference between
the real site and that marked in the regular expressions is very small
(Supplementary Figs S6 and S7).

The two mitochondrial motifs are both characterized by the
presence of Arg residues in the region immediately surrounding the
site. Previous works reported distinctive sequence motifs of cleavage
sites in mitochondrial proteins (Mossmann et al., 2012 for a review).
They identified Arg—rich short motifs which are all included into the
longer M1 and M2 motifs found in this study.

Chloroplastic cleavage sites are characterized by high concentra—
tions of Ala, Ile, Cys and Val residues. These findings corroborate
and add to the conclusions of an early study carried on a limited set
of 32 chloroplastic cleavage sites (Gavel and von Heijne, 1990).

3.3 Performance of the cleavage—site prediction

Performances of the different methods on cleavage—site prediction
are listed in Table 5. We compare TPpred3 to our TPpred
(Indio et al., 2013 and TPpred2 (Savojardo et al., 2014), a predictor
specialized for only mitochondrial targeting peptides that also
includes mitochondrial sequence specific motifs. We also include in
the benchmark PredSL (Petsalaki et al., 2006), TargetP

(Emanuelsson et al., 2000), MitoProt (Claros and Vincens, 1996)
and the recently released MitoFates (Fukasawa et al., 2015).

TPpred3 (Table 5) exactly identifies 66 mitochondrial
[QC(M):0.33] and 25 chloroplastic cleavage sites [QC(C):0.26].
Only TargetP, and only for mitochondrial proteins, is performing
better [QC(M) : 0.39], possibly due to the fact that we are control—
ling homology only in our predictor. TPpred3 is outperforming all
methods when considering the average prediction error (ME) and
the fraction of predicted cleavage sites whose distance from real site
is below the standard deviation of the organelle—targeting peptide
length distribution (E6).

For mitochondrial targeting peptides, TPpred3 slightly outper—
forms even TPpred2.0, which also adopted known sequence motifs
in order to improve the localization of mitochondrial cleavage site.
In the case of chloroplastic targeting peptides, the motifs we extract,
greatly improve the prediction.

4 Conclusions

In this article, we describe the performance of TPpred3, a new inte—
grated method that predicts and discriminates targeting peptides of
mitochondrial and chloroplastic eukaryotic proteins. The method is
characterized by a low rate of false positives and high performance
scores when compared with the state—of—the—art methods addressing
the same task. Furthermore, TPpred3 is also improving the cleavage
site prediction by introducing and exploiting different cleavage site
motifs of the different import systems of mitochondria and
chloroplasts.

TPpred3 is organized as a pipeline where the different software
modules are devised to address targeting—peptide detection, classifi—
cation and cleavage—site refinement. In principle, a single GRHCRF
model can tackle all the three tasks: targeting peptide prediction and
peptide classification (organelle—specific annotation), and detection
of motif—aware cleavage—sites. Despite the inherent elegance and
compactness of the solution, preliminary tests (data not shown) lead
to poor performance compared with the ones of the pipeline pre—
sented in this article.

For the problem at hand, we still have a limited amount of
experimental data and handling the problem with a pipeline allows
us to exploit effectively relevant information in a separate way at
each prediction step.

TPpred3 is a pipeline that integrates different machine—learning
predictors. For this reason, errors propagate throughout the differ—
ent prediction steps. An empirical evaluation of error propagation
(Supplementary Table 51) indicates that much of the error is at the
TPCM level and it is due to erroneous predictions performed by
TPpred (both false negative and incorrect cleavage site predictions).

In summary, TPpred3 is particularly suited for eukaryotic pro—
teins annotation in sequence experiments, producing large amount
of data. Our method starting from sequence classifies proteins in re—
lation to the presence or absence of targeting peptides in sequences
that are targeted to two distinct types of organelles: mitochondria
and chloroplasts. We propose its application particularly in annota—
tion processes of green Eukaryotic (Archaeplastida) genomes, where
proteins with targeting peptides after synthesis are delivered to ei—
ther organelle.

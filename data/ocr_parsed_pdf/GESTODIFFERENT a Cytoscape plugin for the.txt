ABSTRACT

Summary: The characterization of the complex phenomenon of cell
differentiation is a key goal of both systems and computational biol-
ogy. GESTODIFFERENT is a Cytoscape plugin aimed at the generation
and the identification of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) describing
an arbitrary stochastic cell differentiation process. The (dynamical)
model adopted to describe general GRNs is that of noisy random
Boolean networks (NRBNs), with a specific focus on their emergent
dynamical behavior. GESTODIFFERENT explores the space of GRNs by
filtering the NRBN instances inconsistent with a stochastic lineage
differentiation tree representing the cell lineages that can be obtained
by following the fate of a stem cell descendant. Matched networks can
then be analyzed by Cytoscape network analysis algorithms or, for
instance, used to define (multiscale) models of cellular dynamics.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cell differentiation is the process by which the progeny of toti-
and multi-potent stem cells progressively develops in more spe-
cialized cell types, characterized by particular properties and
functions. The characterization of this complex and still mostly
undeciphered phenomenon is of key importance for both com-
putational and systems biology.

To address this problem, we here introduce GESTODIFFERENT, a
plugin for Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011) that builds on the dy-
namical model of cell differentiation introduced in Villani et al.
(2011). The key hypothesis of the model is that cell types are
characterized by coherent gene activation patterns of the under-
lying gene regulatory networks (GRNs), and that the degree of
differentiation is correlated with the stability of these patterns to
noise and perturbations (e.g. mutations). In particular, more dif-
ferentiated cells would show more sophisticated control

mechanisms against noise and mutations (compare Hoffman
et al., 2008 and references therein). In Villani et al. (2011), this is
achieved by considering noisy random Boolean networks (N RBNs)
as a GRN model and by focusing on the dynamical behavior that
emerges from the interaction of a large number of genes. The model
is general (i.e. it does not refer to any speciﬁc organism) and was
proven to reproduce some key properties of the differentiation pro-
cess, namely, (i) the presence of different degrees of differentiation,
i.e. from toti-/multi-potent stem cells to intermediate states, to fully
differentiated cells; (ii) the stochastic differentiation process, ac-
cording to which a population of toti-/multi—potent cells generates
progenies of distinct types by means of a stochastic process; and (iii)
the induced pluripotency phenomenon, according to which fully
differentiated cells can achieve a pluripotent stage through the per-
turbation of some key genes (Y amanaka, 2009).

Within this framework, GESTODIFFERENT can generateiac-
cording to some speciﬁc (user-defined) featuresiand select
GRNs that display an appropriate emergent behavior matching
an input cell lineage differentiation tree (e.g. that of intestinal
crypts or hematopoietic cells). The Cytoscape environment
then allows for further network-speciﬁc analysis and matching
against well-known biological databases.

Our group is working on meshing different simulation levels for
intestinal crypt development in conjunction with colorectal cancer
development. GESTODIFFERENT has been used to identify GRNs
describing the lineage commitment tree of cell populations in co-
lonic crypts in De Matteis et al. (submitted for publication).
Matched networks have been subsequently used within a multi-
cellular and multiscale simulation model (Graudenzi et al., 2012),
which we used to study some key cellular processes, such as cell
growth, migration, sorting, division and lineage commitment; the
selected NRBNs are consistent with the expected behaviour and
are amenable to perturbation studies. Finally, new matching ﬁlters
could in principle be devised to consider epigenetic factors pertain-
ing to the cell differentiation process.

2 THE MODEL

GESTODIFFERENT is based on a dynamical model of GRN for cell
differentiation, described by NRBNs (Villani et al., 2011), an
extension of RBNs (Kauffman, 1969) accounting for noise.

An RBN is composed of n Boolean nodes, each of them asso-
ciated with a Boolean variable a,- e {0, 1} representing the expres-
sion of a gene: if a,- = 1 the i-th gene synthesizes its product
(i.e. proteins or RNAs), otherwise it is inactive. Hence, states
of an RBN are Boolean vectors. Each node is connected to
k,- 5 n — 1 input nodes, and the values of the variables change
at discrete time steps, according to the deterministic time evolu-
tion of the RBN. The value of the node a,- at time t+1 is
determined according to a speciﬁc Boolean function f, and the
input nodes at time t, 0,-(t + 1) =f,-(aj,(t), aj2(t), . . . , O‘jk‘ (t)). Here,
f, is the Boolean function associated with 0,. The evolution of the
system is determined by the parallel update of all the elements, at
any discrete time step. An RBN is synchronous and
deterministic; thus, its evolution will eventually cycle through
some states, called attractor. Varying the structural features of
the networks, different dynamical regimes appear, ranging from
ordered to disordered behaviors.

Introducing noise in RBNs makes the model more pliable; one
of the effects of noise on an RBN is to allow for transitions
between attractors, as resulting from a gene’s random ‘ﬂips’.
This allows for the evaluation of an attractors transition network
(ATN), i.e. a stability matrix between attractors. In turn, by
pruning ‘rare’ transitions from an ATN (as determined by intro-
ducing a noise threshold), NRBNs can model GRN noise-resis-
tance. By deﬁning multiple thresholds and by identifying strongly
connected components within pruned ATNs, it is possible to

deﬁne (hierarchical) threshold ergodic sets (TES) (i.e. noise
dependent gene activation patterns) (see Fig. 1). In Villani
et al. (2011), TESs are mapped to cell types, and less differen-
tiated cells are associated to lower thresholds (i.e. those yielding
larger TESs) because of less reﬁned noise resistance mechanisms,
hence, allowing the GRNs to roam in a wider portion of their
state space (and Vice versa).

3 THE PLUGIN

GESTODIFFERENT is coded in Java and works with Cytoscape
version 2.8 (Smoot et al., 2011). Information about download
and installation can be found at the plugin website (see
Availability).

GESTODIFFERENT sessions are user-deﬁned batch computa-
tions. Parameters are speciﬁed by a step-by-step wizard. These
include: a diﬂerentiation tree (in the.sif Cytoscape formats), the
NRBNs structure (number of genes, type of Boolean functions
and network topology) and the analysis accuracy (exhaustive or
sampling-based approach, recommended for large NRBNs).
Two topologies are supported: (i) random and (ii) scale-free,
with further restrictions, such as ﬁxed incoming/outgoing con-
nections. Three types of Boolean functions are available: (i) stan-
dard ‘and/or’, (ii) random and (iii) canalyzing.

Each computational task is tracked by a progress bar. Once a
task is ﬁnished, (un)matched GRNs are shown in two tables
within the Cytoscape Data Panel. By clicking on a network, it
gets Visualized within Cytoscape, so that it can be further
analyzed (see Fig. 1). Also, all the matching networks are
exported as textual ﬁles, so that they can be used in simulation
environments external to Cytoscape, [e.g. CompuCell3D or the
simulator described in Graudenzi et al. (2012)]. An illustration of
GESTODIFFERENT performance for different sized networks is
available of the plugin website (see Availability).

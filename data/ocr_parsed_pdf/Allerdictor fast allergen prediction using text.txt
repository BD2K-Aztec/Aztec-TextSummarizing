ABSTRACT

Motivation: Accurately identifying and eliminating allergens from bio-
technology-derived products are important for human health. From a
biomedical research perspective, it is also important to identify aller-
gens in sequenced genomes. Many allergen prediction tools have
been developed during the past years. Although these tools have
achieved certain levels of specificity, when applied to large-scale al-
lergen discovery (e.g. at a whole-genome scale), they still yield many
false positives and thus low precision (even at low recall) due to the
extreme skewness of the data (allergens are rare). Moreover, the most
accurate tools are relatively slow because they use protein sequence
alignment to build feature vectors for allergen classifiers. Additionally,
only web server implementations of the current allergen prediction
tools are publicly available and are without the capability of large
batch submission. These weaknesses make large-scale allergen dis-
covery ineffective and inefficient in the public domain.

Results: We developed Allerdictor, a fast and accurate sequence-
based allergen prediction tool that models protein sequences as text
documents and uses support vector machine in text classification for
allergen prediction. Test results on multiple highly skewed datasets
demonstrated that Allerdictor predicted allergens with high precision
over high recall at fast speed. For example, Allerdictor only took
~6 min on a single core PC to scan a whole Swiss-Prot database of
~540 000 sequences and identified <1 % of them as allergens.
Availability and implementation: Allerdictor is implemented in
Python and available as standalone and web server versions at
http://allerdictor.vbi.vt.edu.

1 INTRODUCTION

Allergy is one of the most important chronic diseases worldwide.
It is also one of the main causes of asthma and asthma exacer-
bations, which has been an increasing health issue in developed
countries (Devereux, 2006). Allergic hypersensitivity (IgE-type
response) in sensitized individuals is elicited by allergens. The
allergeniIgE interaction often results in mast cells and/or baso-
phils releasing multiple inflammatory mediators such as

histamine, leukotrienes, cytokines and chemokines. These medi-
ators can cause a variety of symptoms from mild to severe
including sneezing, itching, rashes, hives, difﬁculty in breathing
and asthma attacks that can lead to death (Masoli et al., 2004;
Stagg et al., 2013).

It is important to identify and eliminate potential allergens
from biotechnology-derived products, such as genetically modi-
fied crops, vaccines and therapeutics, as well as identifying
allergens from sequenced genomes. However, IgE-mediated
allergenicity is costly and difficult to assess without human
data because no single factor has been recognized as a primary
identiﬁer for allergenicity (Ladics et al., 2011; Stagg et al., 2013).
Therefore, bioinformatics approaches have been widely used to
prescreen novel sequences (Mari et al., 2009). The FAO/WHO
guideline to assess allergenicity of genetically modified crops uses
relaxed sequence similarity criteria. A protein is identiﬁed as a
potential allergen if it harbors >35% identity with a known
allergen over a window of 80 amino acids or has six contiguous
amino acids that are also found in a known allergen (FAO/
WHO, 2001; Metcalfe, 2005). These criteria are implemented in
most of the allergen databases and tools (Mari et al., 2009).
However, the FAO/WHO guideline focuses on sensitivity to pre-
vent potential new allergens entering the food market rather than
accurate prediction. Therefore, these criteria yield high false-
positive (FP) rates such that their application is limited (Ladics
et al., 2011; Stadler and Stadler, 2003). The current Codex guide-
line (Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2009) does not recom-
mend the use of the six contiguous amino acid match criterion.

Many methods for allergen prediction have been developed
and are more accurate than the FAO/WHO pure sequence simi-
larity-based approach. The majority of these methods is based on
supervised machine learning and differs in ways to extract useful
features from amino acid sequences. Most of them rely on
sequence similarity to allergen-speciﬁc peptides or motifs, includ-
ing Stadler and Stadler (2003), Li et a]. (2004), WebAllergen
(Riaz et al., 2005), EVALLER (Barrio et al., 2007; Soeria—
Atmadja et al., 2006) and SORTALLER (Zhang et al., 2012),
or to known IgE epitopes, such as AlgPred (Saha and Raghava,
2006), or with known allergens and putative non-allergens, such
as AllerHunter (Muh et al., 2009). Other methods use physico-
chemical representation of protein structure, such as APPEL
(Cui et al., 2007) and the structural database of allergen proteins
(SDAP) (Ivanciuc et al., 2009), or amino acid/dipeptide compos-
ition, such as AlgPred (Saha and Raghava, 2006).

Although current methods are signiﬁcantly more accurate than
the FAO/WHO approach, large-scale allergen prediction using
these methods is still ineffective and inefﬁcient. On large-scale

data where non-allergens are naturally more abundant, the
number of FP often exceeds the number of true positives (TP)
that lowers the precision and thus the usefulness of the prediction.
Moreover, the most accurate methods are relatively slow, as they
rely on homology and use sequence alignment to construct fea-
ture vectors. Additionally, current allergen prediction methods
come pretrained in the form of web servers without the capability
of large batch submission making large-scale allergen prediction
even more difﬁcult.

In this article, we propose a new sequence-based allergen pre-
diction method (Allerdictor) that can run in linear time of
sequence length and is capable of producing high precision over
high recall, even on highly skewed data. Allerdictor models
sequences as text documents in which words are represented as
overlapping k-mers generated from the sequences. We found that
the k-mer approach is particularly effective in allergen prediction.
Feature construction is much faster than sequence alignment-
based methods and can be performed in linear time of sequence
length. Allerdictor was implemented with both naive Bayes (NB)
and support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁers. SVM outper-
formed NB on more difﬁcult datasets where the level of sequence
similarity between allergens and non-allergens is higher. Thus, we
will mostly discuss results for the SVM-based version.

The advantages of Allerdictor make it practical for large-scale
allergen prediction in applications such as whole-genome anno-
tation, biotechnology-derived gene product screening and aller-
gen discovery from large public sequence databases.

2 METHODS

Allerdictor represents sequences as text documents and uses NB or SVM
for allergen classiﬁcation.

2.1 Datasets

An initial set of allergens was built by combining sequences collected
from the International Union of Immunological Societies allergen no-
menclature (http://allergen.org), Allergome (Mari et al., 2009), SDAP
(Ivanciuc et al., 2003), AllergenOnline (http://allergenonline.org) and
AllerMatch (Fiers et al., 2004) databases. Duplicated sequences and se-
quences without experimental evidence, containing non-standard amino
acids, or shorter than 100 amino acids were removed, and this resulted in
a set of 3 907 high-quality allergen sequences. A portion of this set con-
tains isoforms of the same allergens or allergens with similar sequences. A
putative non-allergen set was created from the Swiss-Prot database
(Magrane and Consortium, 2011) by removing sequences tagged with
‘predicted’ or ‘uncertain’ and sequences annotated with allergen-related
keywords (‘allerg*’, ‘antigen’ or ‘atopy’) similar to other approaches
(Barrio et al., 2007; Muh et al., 2009; Soeria-Atmadja et al., 2006;
Zhang et al., 2012). Because many allergens have yet to be identiﬁed,
this putative non-allergen set may contain some true allergens (noise).
Noise was reduced by further removing sequences that were highly simi-
lar to any of the sequences collected from the allergen databases [390%
identity and 390% coverage on both query and subject sequences when
aligned using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997)]. Similar to the allergen set,
sequences shorter than 100 amino acids or having non-standard amino
acids were also removed. This resulted in a set of 464 101 putative non-
allergens. From the sets of 3907 allergens and 464 101 putative non-aller-
gens, three datasets were derived and used in this study by the following
procedures: All three datasets described later in the text were designed to
contain 10 times as many non-allergens as allergens, which represents the
natural imbalanced distribution of allergens and non-allergens to some

degree. Sequence-based allergen prediction methods often yield low per-
formance on datasets that include many non-allergens that share se-
quence similarity with allergens. Our datasets exhibited low to high
levels of sequence similarity between allergens and non-allergens (Fig.
1) and thus allowed a more comprehensive evaluation of Allerdictor.

0 Dataset A (Allerdictor-A, 3907 allergens, 39 070 non-allergens): All
allergen sequences (including isoforms) were selected and 10 times
that of putative non-allergen sequences were randomly selected from
the putative non-allergen set. This dataset exhibited a low level of
overall sequence similarity between allergens and non-allergens.
When clustered using BLASTClust (Altschul et al., 1997), only
1108 (~3%) non-allergens together with 1293 (~30%) allergens
were grouped in 131 clusters that contained both allergens and
non-allergens (allergen/non-allergen clusters) (Fig. 1). The non-aller-
gen sequences that were clustered with allergen sequences were desig-
nated as ‘allergen-like non-allergens’.

Dataset B (Allerdictor-B, 1990 allergens, 19900 non-allergens): All
allergens were clustered using BLASTClust with 395% identity and
395% coverage on both query and subject sequences into 1990 clus-
ters. To remove sequence redundancy, only one sequence was
selected randomly from each cluster to form a set of 1990 allergens.
Ten times as many non-allergen sequences were randomly selected
from the putative non-allergen set. This dataset also exhibited a low
level of sequence similarity between allergens and non-allergens, with
only 534 (~3%) non-allergens clustered with 473 (~24%) allergens
in 91 allergen/non-allergen clusters (Fig. 1).

Dataset C (Allerdictor-C, 1662 allergens, 16620 non-allergens): All
allergen and putative non-allergen sequences were together clustered
using BLASTClust with 350% identity and 350% coverage on both

query and subject and resulted in 291 allergen-only clusters, 233
allergen/non-allergen clusters and 9529 noniallergen-only clusters.
From each allergen-only and allergen/non-allergen clusters, at most
three allergen sequences were randomly selected. Ten times the
number of non-allergen sequences were selected in similar fashion
from the noniallergen-only and allergen/non-allergen clusters. The
ﬁnal dataset contained 1662 allergens and 16620 non-allergens, in
which a significant number of non-allergens share sequence similarity
to allergens. When being re-clustered using BLASTClust, 6855
(~41%) non-allergens were grouped together with 725 (~44%)
allergens in 232 allergen/non-allergen clusters (Fig. 1).

2.2 Text representation of sequences

To represent an amino acid sequence of length n as a text document,
Allerdictor uses a small sliding window of size k to break the sequence
into n — k + 1 overlapping k-length peptides (k-mers). This collection of
k-mers is used as a new sequence representation. If we consider a k-mer as
a word, this representation is similar to the bag-of-words in document
modeling (Manning et al., 2008). The set of all unique k-mers generated
from training data is similar to the dictionary used in text modeling and
herein called a k-mer dictionary. The feature vector for a sequence can be
constructed by recording the appearance/absence of the k-mers (binary
representation) or counting the frequencies of the k-mers (k-mer fre-
quency representation). Given that N is the size of the k-mer dictionary
built from training data, the k-mer frequency vector for a sequence is as
follows:

X: <x1,xz,...,xN> (1)

where x,- is the frequency of emitting the ith k-mer of the dictionary from
the sequence using the sliding window. Because only a small fraction of
the k-mer dictionary can be generated from a limited length protein se-
quence, the k-mer feature vector is extremely sparse with the maximum of
n — k + 1 non-zero elements.

The k-mer representation of sequences also shares similar properties
with the bag-of-words approach in text modeling (Joachims, 2002) such
as (i) the feature space is high dimensional (the number of possible unique
k-mers is 20k with 20 amino acid alphabet size), (ii) feature vectors are
sparse and (iii) the distribution of k-mer frequencies follows Zipf’s law
(Zipf, 1949) in which the number of rare k-mers is much higher than the
number of frequent k-mers (data not shown).

Many text classiﬁcation methods can then be applied on k-mer se-
quence representation. NB and SVM were chosen for Allerdictor because
they were among the best methods for text classiﬁcation and fast on high
dimensional sparse vectors.

2.3 Naive Bayes

NB is a simple yet effective method for text classiﬁcation, especially for
spam ﬁltering (Manning et al., 2008). Using a multinomial NB model,
Allerdictor-NB models the distributions of k-mer frequencies over aller-
gen/non-allergen classes with a relaxed assumption that k-mer frequencies
are independent of each other given the class. The probability of being an
allergen for a sequence represented by a k-mer frequency vector X in (1) is
given as follows:

17(alg) -p(X lalg)
17(X)

N
p(alg)- 1:11p(kilalg)"" (2)

17(alng) =

2 me). fink-re)”

L'E(alg, nlg) 1:1

where alg and nlg are allergen and non-allergen classes, respectively, and
k,- is the ith k-mer in the dictionary. The probability of seeing the ith
k-mer in the allergen/non-allergen class p(k,-|c) and the prior probability
of the classes p(c) can be estimated from training data of known allergen
and non-allergen sequences. The probability that the sequence is a non-
allergen p(nlg|X) can be calculated by a similar formula.

2.4 Support vector machine

SVM has been successfully used in numerous applications across many
ﬁelds including text classiﬁcation (Boser et al., 1992; Burges, 1998; Cortes
and Vapnik, 1995; Joachims, 2002). Allerdictor-SVM uses a linear SVM
model, and k-mer frequencies are further normalized by the total number
of k-mers generated from the sequence by the sliding window. The nor-
malized vector X’ of a k-mer frequency vector X given in (1) of a sequence
of length n is as follows:

X‘ = <x’1,x’2, ...,x§v> with x:- = xi/(n — k +1) (3)

Each sequence represented by X’ is now a point in an N—dimensional
space. Given a training dataset of M sequences {X’1,X’2, ..,X§M} labeled
with {y1,y2,...,yM} (yizl if X,- is allergen, yiz-l otherwise), a soft
margin linear binary SVM classiﬁer ﬁnds the optimal hyperplane h that
separates allergens from non-allergens with the maximum margin of clas-
siﬁcation, which is equivalent to solving the following:

1 M
an?) arwwza—
" ’ f1 (4)
“an + b) 3 1 — 5,- with i = 1..M

WERN,‘§iZO

subject to

where N—dimensional vector w is the normal vector of h, b/||w|| is the
distance from the origin to h, slack variables *5,- designate how far the
points can pass the margin boundaries (misclassiﬁcation) in cases of non-
linear separable data and C is the regularization constant to control how
much of the training data can be misclassiﬁed.

A new sequence X’ is then classiﬁed by what ‘side’ of h it lays via an
SVM score (with positive score being an allergen):

S VMscore = WTX' + b (5)

This score is then converted to a posterior probability of being an allergen
by ﬁtting a sigmoid function (Lin et al., 2007; Platt, 1999). Training and
testing were conducted using SVMLight software (Joachims, 1999) with
an allergen misclassiﬁcation penalty weight parameter j = 10 to address
data imbalance. The regularization constant C was chosen by optimizing
the performance via cross-validation described later in the text.

2.5 Cross-validation and dimension reduction

Nested 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate Allerdictor perform-
ance on three datasets A, B and C. Each dataset was randomly parti-
tioned into 10 subsets containing roughly equal number of both allergen
and non-allergen sequences. In each evaluation fold, one subset was held
out (test set) and the rest nine subsets were combined and randomly
partitioned into 10 other subsets for an inner 10-fold cross-validation
to choose the best parameters. Mutual information (Manning et al.,
2008) was used to generate feature selection scores. All k-mers were
ranked by mutual information between the class variable (allergen/
non-allergen) and k-mer frequency variables, and the top ranked
k-mers were selected to build the prediction model. A feature abstraction
technique was also used to group k-mers with the same frequency distri-
bution in an allergen training set and in a non-allergen training set. This is
a special case of distributional clustering that has been used successfully
in text classiﬁcation (Baker and McCallum, 1998; Pereira et al., 1993).
The k-mers that were grouped together have the same frequency distri-
bution over the allergen/non-allergen classes (observed from training

data), and therefore, they received the same weights in the classiﬁcation
model.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Evaluation results of Allerdictor on the three datasets built in
this study (A, B and C) as well as the AllerHunter dataset
demonstrated that Allerdictor is capable of obtaining high pre-
cision over high recall rates. We evaluated Allerdictor using pre-
cision/recall (PR) measures that are widely used in information
retrieval (Manning et al., 2008) instead of sensitivity/speciﬁcity
measures in Receiver-Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) ana-
lysis. A PR curve plots precision against recall obtained by vary-
ing the prediction score cutoff. Given the numbers of TP, FP,
true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN), precision and recall
are defined as follows.

Pr 1' ion — i
ec S T (TP + FP)
Recall = —

(TP + FN)

A ROC plots TP rate (also called sensitivity or recall) against FP
rate (1 — speciﬁcity). Because non-allergens are much more abun-
dant than allergens in nature, a method that predicts many more
FP than TP (low precision) can still produce a good ROC as long
as its sensitivity is high and thus is often misleading (Davis and
Goadrich, 2006). The PR curves can reveal high FP rates and
thus provide a more meaningful evaluation on naturally skewed
allergen/non—allergen distributions, which are also represented in
datasets A, B and C.

3.1 Length of k-mer peptides

The length of k-mer peptides is the most important parameter for
Allerdictor prediction models. Allerdictor performed differently
with different k values. Performance peaked at k: 5 or 6 and
decreased as k moved away from the peaks (Supplementary
Fig. 81). This interesting result agrees with the debatable criter-
ion of six contiguous amino acid matches with a known allergen
used by FAO/WHO guideline. The classiﬁcation power of
Allerdictor comes with its ability to distinguish and assign
higher weight to k-mers that are more likely associated with
allergens (Section 3.4). With k=5, Allerdictor produced near
perfect FP rates, whereas k=6 allowed for better sensitivity
and still maintained low FP rates. We chose k: 6 for the ana-
lyses and results reported in the following sections.

3.2 Allerdictor produces high precision over high recall

We performed nested 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate
Allerdictor performance in comparison with the baseline classi-
ﬁers we derived from FAO/WHO guidelines on our three data-
sets. The two derivatives were BLAST and MEM (maximal exact
match). In the BLAST method, a protein was classiﬁed based on
the best BLAST similarity score (E-Value) against a database of
known allergens from the training set. In MEM, the longest
subsequence of contiguous amino acid matches against the aller-
gens in the training set was chosen as the classiﬁcation score.
MEM was implemented using SparseMEM software (Khan
et al., 2009).

For all three datasets, both Allerdictor-NB and Allerdictor-
SVM performed better than BLAST and MEM with higher pre-
cision over the same recall rate as well as larger area under the
PR curve (AUPRC) (Fig. 2). NB and SVM performed equally on
datasets A and B, whereas with dataset C, SVM exhibited better
performance. The AUPRCs for Allerdictor-SVM averaged at
0.97, 0.91 and 0.85 for datasets A, B and C, respectively.
BLAST’s and MEM’s performance was acceptable on datasets
exhibiting low levels of sequence similarity between allergens and
non-allergens (AUPRC%0.74).8 for datasets A and B).
However, their performance dropped dramatically when the
level of sequence similarity between allergens and non-allergens
increased (dataset C). BLAST appeared to be more vulnerable to
a drop in performance with AUPRC B 0.25 and precision rarely
reaching 0.5 on dataset C. MEM was less vulnerable
(AUPRC%0.63) compared with BLAST, yet failed to produce
>0.6 precision over >0.6 recall. On the other hand, Allerdictor
still yielded high performance on dataset C. The AUPRC was
~0.81 for Allerdictor-NB and ~0.85 for Allerdictor-SVM, and
both still produced ~0.8 precision over 0.8 recall. As SVM per-
formed more robustly than NB, studies were concentrated on
SVM.

The capability of Allerdictor to produce high precision over
high recall rates is due to its extremely high speciﬁcity (low FP
rate). To assess Allerdictor speciﬁcity, we trained Allerdictor-
SVM with each of the three datasets and predicted allergens
for the whole Swiss-Prot database. The results conﬁrmed
Allerdictor had a high level of speciﬁcity with <1% of proteins
in the Swiss-Prot database predicted as allergens (Table 1).
Regardless of the level of similarity between allergens and non-
allergens in the training datasets, Allerdictor still predicted <1%
of Swiss-Prot as allergens. Homology-based methods often pro-
duce many FP when trained with datasets exhibiting low levels
of sequence similarity between allergens and non-allergens.
Allerdictor speciﬁcity, on the other hand, is consistent.

3.3 Allerdictor prediction time is linear

Sequence alignment-based approaches, which are also the most
accurate current allergen prediction methods, construct features
from sequence alignment. Most of the prediction time for a se-
quence is spent on aligning the sequence against a database
of full-length allergen/non—allergen sequences and/or allergen-
speciﬁc peptides. This depends on the length of both the se-
quence and the database. Moreover, aligning sequences requires
non-linear time of the sequences’ length, which makes large-scale
allergen prediction a relatively time-consuming task.

Allerdictor feature construction and prediction times are both
linear of the length of the sequence. Counting frequency of
k-mers from a sequence can be achieved in linear time of the
length of the sequence and does not depend on training data.
Prediction time for both NB and SVM has two components. The
ﬁrst one is the time required to look up model parameters (e. g.
SVM weights) for the k-mers generated from the sequence. With
proper hashing techniques, the total look up time is also linear of
the number of k-mers on average. The second component is the
time to compute the score of the model (NB or linear SVM) that
is also linear of the number of k-mers, as it involves only non-

Allerdictor prediction time is linear of the length of the sequence.

The running time of Allerdictor (both web server and standa-
lone versions) was estimated in comparison with the other meth-
ods (including EVALLER, AlgPred, AllerHunter, APPEL and
SORTALLER) on a random test set of 100 protein sequences
(average length of 326 amino acids) and the whole Swiss-Prot
database. As only web server versions of the other methods were
available, we wrote scripts to submit sequences one by one to the
web servers and measured the time needed to run 100 sequences,
including time for data transmission over the web. For these
methods, the estimated time required to run the whole Swiss-
Prot database was derived from the time used for 100 sequences.
For Allerdictor web server, true running time to scan the whole
Swiss-Prot database was measured using a similar submission
script. The lower bound for AllerHunter feature construction
was also estimated by time required to align sequences against
the database of training sequences using BLAST. Allerdictor
was extremely fast compared with other methods (Table 2).
Allerdictor standalone version only took ~6min (on a single

core PC), and Allerdictor web server submission took ~34.5h
to scan the whole Swiss-Prot of 539 616 protein sequences. Web
server performance depends on many factors such as web server
configuration and internet connection speed, and therefore the
rough estimates obtained in Table 2 were not necessarily the true
performance. However, these estimates should correlate with
true running time and were appropriate for comparison. The
linear running time in addition to high precision over high
recall makes Allerdictor more practical for large-scale allergen
discovery compared with existing methods.

3.4 Allerdictor distinguishes allergen-related peptides

An IgE epitope is a region of an allergen that can be recognized
by and interact with allergen-specific IgE antibodies. It is per-
haps the most important allergenicity identiﬁcation feature.
However, IgE epitopes exist in both linear form (continuous
amino acids) and conformational form (discontinuous amino
acids brought together Via protein folding) and thus are difﬁcult
to model. Sequence similarity approaches in allergen prediction
such as those corresponding to the FAO/WHO guideline are
centered on knowledge of IgE epitope length, which ranges
from 3771 amino acids according to the known IgE epitopes
from SDAP (Ivanciuc et al., 2003). These approaches, however,
cannot distinguish between sequence similarity matches in re-
gions that are related to allergenicity such as the IgE epitopes,
and those in regions that are commonly found in both allergens
and non-allergens, and thus yield low performance.

Allerdictor is effective in allergen prediction because it is
capable of distinguishing allergen-related short peptides (possibly
but not necessarily IgE epitopes per se). For example,
Allerdictor, although does not directly model IgE epitope struc-
tures, can learn and assign higher weight to k—mers that are
subsequences of known IgE epitopes using a machine learning
approach. We investigated this using a set of 183 known IgE

epitopes (from 29 allergens) collected from SDAP (one of the
most updated lists of known IgE epitopes). As given in (5), k-
mers with higher weight in the linear SVM model represent more
allergen predictive features (more commonly found in allergens).
We ranked k-mers by their weight and investigated the distribu-
tion of the ranks of the k-mers that were subsequences of at least
one known I gE epitope (IgE epitope-matched k—mers). We found
>1000 IgE epitope-matched k-mers learned from each of the
datasets A, B and C (Supplementary Table 81). The majority
of the IgE epitope-matched k-mers (>93%) were ranked in the
top 10% among ~4.&9.1 million k—mers obtained from the
training data (or 90% of them were ranked in the top 3.4, 5.5
and 5.9% for datasets A, B and C, respectively) (Fig. 3). This
result suggests that Allerdictor is capable of assigning higher
weight to k-mers that are more important for allergenicity such
as those found in IgE epitopes than those that are often found in
both allergens and non-allergens. For datasets A and B, almost
all IgE epitope-matched k-mers were ranked among the top,
whereas a small number of these k-mers for dataset C had low
ranks. This can be explained by the fact that dataset C only
contained a fraction of the known allergens (and IgE epitopes)
Via the relaxed sequence clustering criteria described earlier.

In fact, many of the highly ranked k-mers formed continu-
ous peptides overlapping with known IgE epitopes. We ran
Allerdictor on 25 allergen proteins with IgE epitopes previously
mapped (prepared from the set of 29 allergens with known IgE
epitopes collected from the SDAP). The majority of the known
IgE epitopes overlapped with regions formed by highly ranked
k-mers, and many of them were fully covered by these regions
(Supplementary Figs S2784). This result suggests that the regions
of a protein sequence that contain highly ranked k-mers have
higher probability of being part of IgE epitopes or other im-
munologically relevant features, and thus they are highlighted
in the prediction output of Allerdictor server for further compu-
tational and/or experimental investigation by the end users.

3.5 Comparison with other methods

Current allergen prediction tools were first evaluated on a set of
randomly drawn ~10% of dataset C (167 allergens and 1663
non-allergens, test set X). For methods that produced

monotonous prediction scores (AlgPred, AllerHunter,
SORTALLER), the score cutoff was varied to obtain PR
curves. For other methods (EVALLER, APPEL), ﬁxed default
performance measures were calculated from the number of cor-
rect and incorrect predictions. The results showed that all meth-
ods evaluated yielded low precision on the chosen test set
(Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Fig. S5). None
of the methods yielded precision >0.4 over recall >0.6 for PR
curves. For default performance, only EVALLER and
AllerHunter yielded Matthews correlation coefﬁcient >0.5 with
both precision and recall >0.5. Sequence similarity-based meth-
ods (AllerHunter and EVALLER) appeared to perform better in
this test. As expected, performance was correlated with the time
the methods were released, where later methods performed better
(with the exception that SORTALLER performed poorly, al-
though it was the latest method in this test). AllerHunter per-
formed better than other methods, partly because it was trained
on a dataset that contained many allergen-like non-allergens, a
characteristic that was also exhibited by the test data.

Because performance of supervised machine learning methods
depends heavily on training and testing data, we avoided com-
parison of Allerdictor with other methods trained with different
datasets. Current allergen prediction methods were pretrained
with speciﬁc datasets and only available in the form of web
servers and thus prevented retraining them for comprehensive
comparison with Allerdictor. Therefore, we investigated these
datasets on whether they are appropriate to train and compare
Allerdictor with the pretrained web servers of these methods.
Among three publicly available datasets, AllerHunter was the
only dataset that possessed a signiﬁcant level of sequence simi-
larity between allergens and non-allergens and had many more
non-allergens than allergens (Fig. 1). The AlgPred dataset was
small and sequence names were masked, whereas the EVALLER
non-allergen sequences that were used to derive allergen-speciﬁc
peptides were not available. The level of sequence similarity be-
tween allergens and non-allergens for AlgPred and EVALLER
was low as determined by BLASTClust (Fig. 1).

The AllerHunter dataset (http://tiger.dbs.nus.edu.sg/
AllerHunter/) was considered the only complete dataset for the
purpose of the comparison. However, this dataset was redundant
and contained noise. The AllerHunter dataset was reviewed and
found to contain 48 obsolete sequences [deleted from Genbank
(Benson et al., 2010) and Swiss-Prot], 233 duplicated sequences
and 328 short sequences (3750 amino acids). Also, among the
non-allergens, 135 were found to be true allergens, 176 were
antigens and 165 contained allergen-related ambiguous annota-
tion (from Swiss-Prot and Allergome databases). The noise pos-
sibly resulted from new annotation added to the public databases
after AllerHunter data were collected. We accepted the noise for
training data and trained Allerdictor on the same training set of
sequences (1266 allergens and 11229 non-allergens) that was
used to train AllerHunter server (personal communication with
Martti Tammi) and compared Allerdictor with AllerHunter
server on two test sets: the original AllerHunter test set (139
allergens and 1245 non-allergens) that contained noise and the
revised version of the test set with reduced noise (149 allergens
and 1141 non-allergens). The review process moved the newly
discovered allergens from the non-allergen set to the allergen set
and removed duplicated, obsolete or ambiguous sequences and
non-allergen sequences that had 90% identity over 90% coverage
with a known allergen (similar to the procedure used to reduce
noise from Allerdictor datasets).

Comparison results on AllerHunter dataset showed that
Allerdictor slightly outperformed AllerHunter with slightly
larger AUPRCs (Fig. 4). An interesting trend was that
Allerdictor produced higher high-range precision (>0.8) at
lower recall (<0.8). At recall >0.85, both Allerdictor and
AllerHunter produced many FP, and thus the precision for
both methods dropped below 0.6. AllerHunter performed
slightly better in lower-range precision (<0.75) at a narrow
recall range from ~0.8&0.9. High-range precision is particularly
useful in large-scale prediction. For example, one often chooses
the top scoring candidates from computational predictions for
further experimental validation, which is equivalent to lowering
recall to obtain higher precision. Along with higher high-range
precision, Allerdictor also runs much faster than AllerHunter
(Section 3.3), which makes it the better choice for large-scale
allergen prediction.

The amino acid composition and dipeptide approaches in
AlgPred are special cases of k-mer approach in Allerdictor
with k: 1 and 2. We found that such small values of k yielded
low performance on multiple datasets, including datasets A, B
and C. Also pointed out by AlgPred authors, when tested with
Swiss-Prot non-allergens, AlgPred falsely predicted ~40% of
them to be allergens (Saha and Raghava, 2006).

3.6 Allerdictor prefers larger number of k-mers

The size of the k-mer dictionary (also the feature vector size) is
exponential of k (20") and therefore many machine learning
approaches are prevented from using k-mer sequence representa-
tion. In reality, the size of the k—mer dictionary depends on train-
ing datasets and is much smaller than the number of possible
k-mers. Allerdictor when trained with k = 6 on datasets A, B and
C had feature space dimension of ~4.6, 5.7 and 9.1 million, re-
spectively (much smaller than 206). To test if we can reduce

the number of k-mers without lowering performance, feature
selection using mutual information and feature abstraction
were performed with Allerdictor-SVM using k = 6.

The results on datasets A, B and C showed that no perform-
ance gain was achieved with both feature selection and feature
abstraction (Supplementary Fig. S6). Using 320750% k-mers,
performance was similar to that obtained with all k-mers.
Allerdictor performance slightly dropped when the number
of selected k-mers was 51(L20% and dramatically dropped
when 5&10% k-mers were selected. This result suggests that
Allerdictor generally performs better with more k-mers.
Feature abstraction reduced ~4.&9.1 million k-mers down to
<1000 abstract features when trained using k: 6. Surprisingly,
performance for feature abstraction was close to performance
using all k-mers. This interesting result opens doors for using
other classiﬁcation methods that can only handle a small
number of features.

3.7 Effects of allergen prevalence

Supervised machine learning-based allergen prediction methods
are often available to end users as tools pretrained on some spe-
ciﬁc dataset. The predictive values including positive predictive
value (PPV, also called precision) and negative predictive value

Allerdictor

 

(NPV) of such tools are subject to the prevalence of allergens in
data. We have shown that Allerdictor produced high precision
over high recall when training and testing using data that
exhibited low ratios of allergen sequences.

To provide a complete picture of allergen prediction perform-
ance, we also investigated the effects of allergen prevalence (in
testing data) on PPV and NPV of Allerdictor and the current
allergen prediction tools. As expected, predictive values of all
methods were affected by the prevalence of allergens in testing
data (Supplementary Figs S77S9). When the prevalence of aller-
gens was low, AllerHunter, APPEL and EVALLER exhibited
higher predictive values than AlgPred and SORTALLER on a
random set of sequences drawn from dataset C (Supplementary
Fig. S8). Allerdictor exhibited stable PPV on datasets A, B, C
(Supplementary Fig. S7) and on AllerHunter dataset
(Supplementary Fig. S9). When allergen ratio was 50.5,
Allerdictor achieved both PPV and NPV 30.8 in all datasets.
Compared with AllerHunter on AllerHunter dataset,
Allerdictor PPV and NPV were better when allergen prevalence
was low, but AllerHunter exhibited more balanced PPV and
NPV when the ratio of allergens was higher. The NPV of all
methods including Allerdictor decayed rapidly as the ratio of
allergens in the test sets increased. However, this behavior does
not signiﬁcantly limit the application of machine learning-based
allergen prediction methods because allergen prevalence is low in
nature and in many applications. For example, there exist ~20
known allergens among >9000 proteins coded by the genome
of the allergenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus (Fedorova et al.,
2008). Low allergen ratio is a characteristic of large sequence sets
often seen in large-scale sequence annotation, which is also
Allerdictor’s main application.

4 CONCLUSION

This article presented an accurate sequence-based allergen pro-
tein prediction method (Allerdictor) that is much faster than the
current most accurate methods while still maintaining compar-
able or better predictive performance (when compared with
AllerHunter). The main idea is the use of the k-mer feature rep-
resentation of sequences, and thus linear prediction time is
achieved for both feature construction and prediction using a
linear SVM model. Moreover, the k-mer approach is particularly
effective for allergen prediction because supervised machine
learning methods such as SVM can learn the k-mers shared by
many allergens such as the one found in IgE epitopes and assign
higher weights to these k-mers.

The prevalence of asthma has been an increasing human
health issue. Approximately 2357300 million people worldwide
were diagnosed with asthma with annual deaths of ~250 000
(GINA, 2012; WHO, 2013). The majority of asthmatic patients
have allergic asthma in which allergic reactions (caused by aller-
gens) exacerbate asthmatic symptoms. To facilitate our under-
standing and prevention of this disease, it is important to identify
potential allergens from massive amounts of protein sequences
produced every day Via both genome sequencing and sequence
synthesis. Because experimental allergenicity assessment is still
expensive and difﬁcult (especially at large scale), computational
allergen identiﬁcation is an alternative ﬁrst step.

Allerdictor addresses the shortcomings of the current allergen
prediction tools. With high precision over high recall and fast
speed, Allerdictor is not only useful for general sequence aller-
genicity assessment in applications such as screening of novel
proteins introduced to genetically modiﬁed crops but also par-
ticularly suitable for allergen discovery on a large scale in appli-
cations such as whole-genome annotation and quick screening of
synthesized sequences.

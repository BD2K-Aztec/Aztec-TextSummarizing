ABSTRACT

Summary: Measuring the consequences of mutation in proteins
is critical to understanding their function. These measurements
are essential in such applications as protein engineering, drug
development, protein design and genome sequence analysis.
Recently, high-throughput sequencing has been coupled to assays of
protein activity, enabling the analysis of large numbers of mutations in
parallel. We present Enrich, a tool for analyzing such deep mutational
scanning data. Enrich identifies all unique variants (mutants) of a
protein in high-throughput sequencing datasets and can correct
for sequencing errors using overlapping paired-end reads. Enrich
uses the frequency of each variant before and after selection to
calculate an enrichment ratio, which is used to estimate fitness.
Enrich provides an interactive interface to guide users. It generates
user-accessible output for downstream analyses as well as several
visualizations of the effects of mutation on function, thereby allowing
the user to rapidly quantify and comprehend sequence—function
relationships.

Availability and Implementation: Enrich is implemented in
Python and is available under a FreeBSD license at http://depts
.washington.edu/sfields/software/enrich/. Enrich includes detailed
documentation as well as a small example dataset.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding how variations in protein sequence relate to function
is of fundamental importance. Measurement of protein activity is
critical to engineer protein function, to understand how mutations
relate to disease and to gain insight into catalytic mechanisms
(Alper et (11., 2006; Kato et (11., 2003; Weiss et (11., 2000). Efforts
to parallelize measurement of protein activity rely on selection
for a desired function present within a library of variants of a
protein of interest using a display-based system that directly links a
protein’s activity to its encoding DNA sequence (Levin and Weiss,
2006; Pal et (11., 2006; Sidhu and Koide, 2007). Selection for
function (e.g. ligand binding, catalytic activity or stability) alters
the population of displayed proteins, and thus their associated DNA
molecules. DNA sequences encoding highly functional variants

are enriched, whereas DNA sequences encoding poorly functional
variants are depleted.

Sanger sequencing of library members after selection can reveal a
few hundred highly functional variants. Recently, high-throughput
sequencing has been used to signiﬁcantly increase the number of
variants assessed (Di Niro et (11., 2010; Dias-Neto et (11., 2009;
Ernst et (11., 2010; Fowler et (11., 2010; Hietpas et (11., 2011; Hinkley
et (11., 2011; Ravn et (11., 2010). Such ‘deep mutational scanning’
(Araya and Fowler, 2011) experiments engender signiﬁcant analysis
Challenges.

Here, we present Enrich, a tool to address these Challenges.
Enrich identiﬁes and enumerates unique protein sequences within
high-throughput sequencing data. It calculates an enrichment ratio
between unselected and selected libraries for each unique variant,
and it creates a number of visualizations. Enrich is open-source,
freely available and modular, creating easy-to-manipulate output
ﬁles. Thus, users can customize Enrich and perform proj eCt-speciﬁc
analysis.

2 APPROACH

Enrich is implemented in Python. Enrich requires ~2h to run on
a typical dataset on a desktop computer. To facilitate the analysis
of multiple datasets in parallel, Enrich can ﬁinction in a high-
performance computing environment managed by the Oracle Grid
Engine. Enrich uses the DRMAA distributed resource management
API to facilitate extension to other environments (http://drmaa.org/).
Enrich supports command line execution and an interactive mode
that guides users through the conﬁguration and execution of Enrich
runs.

Enrich takes as input FASTQ-formatted high-throughput
sequencing data ﬁles acquired from an unselected and a selected
library (Cook et (11., 2010). Enrich can use reads from any sequencing
platform, provided they are FASTQ-formatted. If overlapping
paired-end reads have been acquired, Enrich corrects each read
pair for sequencing error by examining agreement between the
reads. At positions where the reads disagree, the nucleotide with
the higher quality score is used. If both reads have identical quality
scores at the position in question, the read pair is removed. More
robust error models could improve error correction, particularly
when overlapping paired-end reads are not available (e.g. ShoRAH)
(Zagordi et (11., 2011).

Variant sequences are identiﬁed and enumerated within the
unselected and selected libraries. Variants containing insertions and
deletions are removed. An enrichment ratio (selected/unselected)

Fig. 1. Enrich Visualizations. Enrich produces three Visualizations; examples
from the dataset included with Enrich are shown here. (a) The diversity
within a library is illustrated by a heatmap of the frequency of each position7
mutation combination. (b) The position-averaged change in mutational
frequency between two libraries is shown. (c) The logz-scaled enrichment
ratio for each positionimutation combination is plotted, individually
organized both by position and by amino acid (a single amino acid, serine,
is shown). Blue dots indicate the enrichment or depletion of substitutions.
Red squares correspond to wild-type residues. Grey squares correspond to
unobserved mutations.

is calculated for each variant. Enrichment ratios are evaluated
using a two-sided Poisson exact test to calculate a P-value for the
signiﬁcance of enrichment or depletion for each variant. Multiple
testing correction is performed using false discovery rates (Storey
and Tibshirani, 2003). The resulting q-values enable the user to
identify subsets of variants whose frequency is signiﬁcantly altered
by selection. To accomplish these tasks, the Enrich workﬂow is
divided into seven modules that can run independently or all together
(for a more detailed description, see the Supplementary Material).
Enrich uses matplotlib to produce any of three visualizations as a
starting point for ﬁirther analyses (Fig. 1). The visualizations show
an estimation of library diversity, the position-averaged mutation
enrichment and an all-residue enrichment ratio scan. In addition to
providing these visualization options, Enrich produces easy to use

output ﬁles that can be carried forward into project-speciﬁc analyses.
Enrich can take advantage of high-performance computing to
conduct many analyses in parallel. Enrich’s Python-based modular,
extensible design enables users to customize the software. Enrich
facilitates deep mutational scanning, which can be widely applied
to the breadth of disciplines that depend on understanding protein
sequence—function relationships.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Targeting peptides are the most important signal control-
ling the import of nuclear encoded proteins into mitochondria and
plastids. In the lack of experimental information, their prediction is
an essential step when proteomes are annotated for inferring both
the localization and the sequence of mature proteins.

Results: We developed TPpred a new predictor of organelle-targeting
peptides based on Grammatical-Restrained Hidden Conditional
Random Fields. TPpred is trained on a non-redundant dataset of pro-
teins where the presence of a target peptide was experimentally vali-
dated, comprising 297 sequences. When tested on the 297 positive
and some other 8010 negative examples, TPpred outperformed avail-
able methods in both accuracy and Matthews correlation index (96%
and 0.58, respectively). Given its very low—false-positive rate (3.0%),
TPpred is, therefore, well suited for large-scale analyses at the prote-
ome level. We predicted that from ~4 to 9% of the sequences of
human, Arabidopsis thaliana and yeast proteomes contain targeting
peptides and are, therefore, likely to be localized in mitochondria and
plastids. TPpred predictions correlate to a good extent with the ex-
perimental annotation of the subcellular localization, when available.
TPpred was also trained and tested to predict the cleavage site of the
organelle-targeting peptide: on this task, the average error of TPpred
on mitochondrial and plastidic proteins is 7 and 15 residues, respect-
ively. This value is lower than the error reported by other methods
currently available.

1 INTRODUCTION

Mitochondria and plastids (in plants) are membrane-enclosed
organelles contained in eukaryotic cells that take part into

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

essential biological processes, including cell bioenergetics and
metabolism. Following the endosymbiotic theory, the DNA-
containing organelles derive from free-living bacteria that have
been incorporated into the cytoplasm of early eukaryotic cells.
The organelles retain a small portion of their original genome,
encoding few tens and few hundreds proteins in mitochondria
and plastids, respectively. However, both experimental and com-
putational methods estimate that some thousands different pro-
teins are located in organelles (Sickmann et al., 2003; van Wijk,
2004). The last release of MitoMiner lists 2755 human proteins
experimentally characterized as mitochondrial with mass spec-
trometry or with green-ﬂuorescent protein tagging (Smith
et al., 2012), and the AT_CHLORO database lists 1323
Arabidopsis thaliana proteins annotated as chloroplastic on the
basis of mass spectrometry experiments (Ferro et al., 2010). Most
organellar proteins are, therefore, encoded by the nuclear
genome, synthesized by the cytoplasmic ribosomes and then
targeted to the organelles.

The most common, although not unique, type of targeting
signal consists of an N—terminal sequence (the targeting peptide,
often referred as pre-sequence in mitochondria and transit pep-
tide in plastids). The targeting peptide is cleaved when the native
protein is translocated through the outer membrane of the or-
ganelles by means of the translocon protein complexes. In multi-
cellular organisms, it has been estimated that ~10725% of
nuclear genes encode for proteins endowed with an N—terminal
peptide targeting the protein to mitochondria and plastids
(Emanuelsson et al., 2000). Targeting peptides are highly hetero-
geneous in terms of length (ranging from 10 to 150 residues) and
primary sequence (Bruce, 2001; Patron and Waller, 2007; Staiger
et al., 2009). Phylogenetic and structural studies recognized a
modular architecture in targeting peptides, often consisting of
two or three separate domains, potentially forming amphiphilic
a-helices or ﬂ-strands when interacting with the organelle outer
membrane (Bruce, 2001; Habib et al., 2007). The modular or-
ganization is probably involved in the sub-organellar trafficking
of proteins and gives origin to a great variety of primary se-
quences for targeting peptides (Texeira and Glazer, 2012). In a
small but increasing number of proteins, the same targeting pep-
tide can mediate the translocation to both the mitochondria and
the chloroplasts (Carrie et al., 2009).

Presently, in UniProtKB, only 11% of ~9200 sequences that
are endowed with a targeting peptide are supported by experimen-
tal annotations. Because of the biological importance of targeting
mechanisms and the scarcity of experimentally validated know-
ledge, machine-learning tools have been introduced to predict the
presence of targeting peptides and the position of the correspond-
ing cleavage sites. Early methods are speciﬁc for chloroplasts, e. g.
ChloroP (Emanuelsson et al., 1999) and PCLR (Schein et al.,
2001), and mithochondria, e.g. MitoProt (Claros and Vincens,
1996). More recent tools integrate the prediction of targeting pep-
tides with the prediction of secretory signal peptides, although
they have different compositional and length features. Among
these are TargetP (Emanuelsson et al., 2007), which incorporates
ChloroP, iPSORT (Bannai et al., 2002), Predotar (Small et al.,
2004) and PredSL (Petsalaki et al., 2006).

All methods predict the presence of the targeting peptide, but
only MitoProt, TargetP and PredSL predict the position of the
cleavage site. In general, all the predictors analyse an N—terminal
portion of the native protein, ranging from 40 to 100 residues,
depending on the method. ChloroP (Emanuelsson et al., 1999),
TargetP (Emanuelsson et al., 2007), PCLR (Schein et al., 2001)
and Predotar (Small et al., 2004) are based on neural networks
(NNs) and their input includes residue composition, hydropho-
bicity and abundance of charged residues. iPSORT adopts a
rule-based algorithm that considers 434 different propensity
scales (Bannai et al., 2002). MitoProt deﬁnes a discriminant func-
tion on a pool of 47 physicochemical properties (Claros and
Vincens, 1996). PredSL combines NNs, hidden Markov models
(HMM) and scoring matrices (Petsalaki et al., 2006). Because of
the paucity of data, all methods have been trained on datasets
containing also non-experimentally validated targeting peptides,
predicted with computational methods and/ or inferred by
similarity.

Prediction of targeting peptide can be considered as a labelling
problem, where residues of the N—terminal region of the sequence
are assigned either to ‘t’ (targeting peptide) or ‘n’ (non-targeting
peptide) labels. Grammatical-Restrained Hidden Conditional
Random Fields (GRHCRF) is a recently introduced machine-
learning tool well suited to solve labelling problems (Fariselli
et al., 2009, Savojardo et al., 2011). GRHCRFs offer several
advantages: (i) like HMMs, they can incorporate previous know-
ledge on the problem by introducing a grammar on the predic-
tion labels; (ii) like the Hidden Conditional Random Fields
(HCRF), they are discriminative models and do not require the
strong independence assumptions made in HMMs (Fariselli
et al., 2009; Lafferty et al., 2001); and (iii) similar to NNs, they
can analyse complex and heterogeneous input encodings.

Here, we introduce TPpred, a new predictor for targeting pep-
tides based on GRHCRFs. TPpred is trained on a non-
redundant dataset containing only experimentally validated
targeting peptides and efﬁciently predicts both the presence of
targeting peptides and the localization of the cleavage sites.

2 METHODS
2.1 Dataset

We gathered the eukaryotic proteins longer than 45 residues from
SwissProt (release November 2011) and annotated with existing evidence

at the protein level, with the exclusion of fragments. Starting from this
set, we collected both the positive and the negative datasets. The positive
dataset (proteins endowed with an experimentally detected targeting pep-
tide) was collected searching in the feature ﬁeld for the keyword
‘TRANSIT PEPTIDE’, which identiﬁes all the pre-sequences directing
a protein to an organelle in UniProtKB (http://www.uniprot.org/key
words/KW-0809). We excluded annotations labelled as ‘by similarity’,
‘probable’ or ‘potential’, and we retained only proteins from mitochon-
dria and plastids provided with a known cleavage site. Proteins lacking
the keyword ‘TRANSIT PEPTIDE’ were collected in the negative set. By
this, we obtained 757 positive and 47 363 negative examples. To obtain a
non-redundant dataset, sequences were then compared with Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool, and a graph was built linking the pairs of se-
quences (nodes) that share >30% identity on local alignments (HSP) with
e-value <10’3. The graph was clustered by extracting its connected com-
ponents with a transitive closure algorithm. After this procedure, se-
quences in different clusters share <30% identity. We also checked that
the 160-residue long N-terminal regions of sequences are <30% identical
when extracted from different clusters. The non-redundant training data-
set was built by randomly selecting one sequence per cluster. The ﬁnal
dataset consists of 297 sequences with targeting peptide (DB+) and 8010
without targeting peptide (DB—) (Table 1). To test whether the prediction
is affected by the presence of transmembrane helices, we extracted a
subset of proteins with an or-helix annotated in the 160 residue-long
N-terminal segment by UniProtKB (values in parentheses of Table 1).
The dataset is available at: http://biocomp.unibo.it/~valentina/TPpred/.

2.2 GRHCRF

Prediction of targeting peptides can be posed as a labelling problem with
a strong grammatical constraint: the targeting peptide region (‘t’) pre-
cedes the non-targeting peptide region (11’). Starting from HMMs that
are the prototypical models addressing this type of problems, Conditional
Random Fields (CRF) have been introduced: they are discriminative
models that allow relaxing the strong independence assumptions of
HMMs by means of a global normalization procedure (Lafferty et al.,
2001). GRHCRFs have been developed to overcome the limitations of
the coincidence between labels and states typical of CRFs (Fariselli et al.,
2009; Savojardo et al., 2011). GRHCRFs decouple the set of labels from
the set of states and allow deﬁning a one-to-many mapping between
them. Like HMMs, GRHCRFs can be represented through an automa-
ton comprising a set of labelled states connected by transitions. The top-
ology of the automaton casts the grammar to be modelled. The same
label can be shared among different states. This ensures a great expressive
power of the method and a large ﬂexibility in the automaton design. A
feature function is associated to each state and to each transition. The
parameters of the feature functions are learned from the association be-
tween the input sequences included in the training set and their known
labellings. Discriminative learning has been implemented for ﬁnding the
parameters that maximize the probability of a label given the input (see
Fariselli et al., 2009 for details). Given a trained model, the labelling of a

sequence is predicted with the posterior-Viterbi algorithm. This imple-
ments a decoding procedure that preserves the grammar, and it is based
on the posterior probabilities for each label as computed by the model
(Fariselli et al., 2005).

2.3 Input features

For each sequence, 160 N-terminal residues were considered for building
the input to GRHCRFs. Each position of the segment was encoded with
a 2S-valued vector describing the type and the physicochemical features
of the corresponding residue. The 2S-valued vector comprises four differ-
ent modules: (i) a 20-valued binary vector, describing the residue type,
whose elements are all null but the one corresponding to the residue to be
encoded (seq); (ii) one value encoding the average KyteDoolittle hydro-
phobicity (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) of a seven-residue long window
centred on the residue to be encoded (kd); (iii) two values encoding the
number of positively and negatively charged residues in a seven-residue
window (ch); and (iv) two values describing the hydrophobic moments
(hm) computed considering 100° and 160° angles for simulating ideal or-
helices and ,B-sheets, respectively. The program hmoment included in
EMBOSS (Rice et al., 2000) was adopted to carry out the computation
of the hydrophobic moments. For each position in the sequence, the
feature function of each GRHCRF state considers an ll-residue window;
therefore, it takes in input 11 x 25 = 275 different variables. When encod-
ing the ﬁve N- and C-terminal residues of each sequence, we padded the
empty positions of the window with ‘0’ values.

2.4 Training procedure

We adopted a 5-fold cross-validation procedure for training and testing,
by randomly splitting the non-redundant training set into ﬁve subsets.
Three subsets were used for training the method (training set), one for
validation (validation set) and the remaining for evaluating the perform-
ance (test set). The best model topology, the best parameters and the best
input were selected on the basis of the results obtained on the validation
set. Five training runs were performed, and performance was computed
collecting all the results obtained for the ﬁve test sets.

2.5 Scoring the performance

Different scoring indexes were used to evaluate the prediction perform-
ances at the protein level. For the two protein classes, namely, ‘with
targeting peptide’ (+) and ‘without targeting peptide’ (—), we indicated
with TP and TN the number of true-positive and true-negative predic-
tions, respectively, and with FF and FN the number of false-positive and
false-negative predictions, respectively.

General prediction scores are the overall accuracy (Acc) and the
Matthews correlation coefﬁcient (MCC), deﬁned as follows:

TP + TN

ACCZTP+TN+FP+FN (1)

TP>TN—FP>FN

MCC =
\/(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FN)(TN + FP)

 

(2)

 

Unlike Acc, MCC is only slightly affected by bias deriving from the
unbalance between positive and negative examples in the dataset, and it is
then the most useful global score. Scoring indexes evaluating the perform-
ance on the single class are sensitivity (Sn), speciﬁcity (Sp) and false-
positive rate (FPR) computed as:

5"“) =%v (3)
SW) = ﬁ (4)
FPR(c) = $ (5)

where c is the class at hand. A thorough explanation of the purposes of
these indexes can be found in Baldi et a]. (2000).

2.6 Prediction with available methods

For sake of comparison, we predicted the sequences included in our
dataset with the following methods: (i) the TargetP server was accessed
at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/; (ii) the executable version of
iPSORT was downloaded from http://ipsort.hgc.jp/caml-iPSORT/;
(iii) the executable version of PredSL was downloaded from http://
hannibal.biol.uoa.gr/PredSL/source.html; (iv) the Predotar server was
accessed at http://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/predotar/predotar.html; (v) the
software of MitoProt was downloaded from ftp://ftp.biologie.ens.fr/
pub/molbio; and (vi) PCLR was re-implemented in house using the par-
ameters listed in http://www.andrewschein.com/cgi-bin/pclr/weights.html.
When required, the proper prediction parameters were selected, dividing
plant and non-plant proteins.

2.7 Whole-proteome analysis

The complete sets of proteins from Homo sapiens (GRHh37.pS),
A.thaliana (TAIRlO) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (EF4) were down-
loaded from the EnsEMBL website (www.ensembl.org). These sets com-
prise 93588, 35386 and 6692 protein sequences (including splicing
variants), respectively. They are encoded by 21160, 27 416 and 6692
genes, respectively. We predicted all the proteins with our TPpred and
checked the agreement between the prediction of targeting peptide and
the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of the subcellular localization as
reported in EnsEMBL. We retained only experimental annotations
labelled with the following evidence codes: EXP (experimental), IDA
(inferred from direct assay), IPI (inferred from physical interaction),
IMP (inferred from mutant phenotype), IGI (inferred from genetic inter-
action) and IEP (inferred from expression pattern) (http://www.geneon-
tology.org/GO.evidence.shtml).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.2 Main features of targeting peptides

3.1.] Length The length of the mitochondrial and plastidic
targeting peptides ranges from 10 up to 150 residues (Fig. 1).
Mitochondrial-targeting peptides are, on average, shorter than
plastidic ones, being the average lengths 35 and 59 residues, re-
spectively. The dispersions around the average lengths are, how-
ever, very high and of ~16 and 22 residues, respectively. We
chose not to separate the two datasets, because of (i) the scarcity
of non-redundant proteins experimentally annotated for target-
ing peptides and (ii) the possibility that the same targeting pep-
tide mediates the translocation to both mitochondria and
plastids (Carrie et al., 2009).

3.1.2 Residue composition The residue composition of target-
ing peptides is plotted in Figure 2 and compared with the whole-
sequence composition of the proteins included in our dataset.
Relative standard deviations of the samples are not shown for
sake of clarity and have been evaluated to be ~20% of the
plotted data. Mitochondrial and plastidic proteins (represented
in Fig. 2 with blue and cyan bars, respectively) do not show
major compositional differences with proteins included in the
negative set (red bars). On the contrary, targeting peptides are
characterized by a peculiar composition. The differences in com-
position between the targeting peptides and the whole sequences
have been assessed in terms of log-odds and P—Values

LIPMFWYSTCNQHDEKR
Residue

(Supplementary Table S1). At a signiﬁcance level equal to 10—10,
both mitochondrial- and plastidic-targeting peptides (black and
grey bars, respectively) are enriched in alanine (A) and serine (S)
and depleted in negatively charged residues (D, E), tyrosine W)
and isoleucine (1). Other differences can be detected when mito-
chondrial- and plastidic-targeting peptides are separately
analysed: the former are enriched in methionine (M), leucine
(L) and arginine (R), whereas lysine (K) is underrepresented.
In plastidic-targeting peptides glycine (G) is less frequent. The
composition of targeting peptides of our dataset is similar to that
of previous analyses (Texeira and Glaser, 2012), and it accounts
for the interactions with proteins involved in protein import and
peptide cleavage, whose structural details are still unknown
(Jarvis and Robinson, 2004; Pfanner and Geissler, 2001).

3.1.3 Cleavage site The strongest compositional information
is thought to reside in the region neighbouring the cleavage site,
as it is recognized by the active site of peptidase complexes.
Starting from the 297 proteins of the positive dataset, we aligned
the eight residues downstream and upstream the cleavage
site. The resulting proﬁle is Visualized in the sequence logo of
Figure 3. The cleavage site is between positions 0 and 1. The logo

 

Fig. 3. Sequence logo of the positions neighbouring the cleavage site.
Sequence logo (Schneider and Stephens, 1990) is computed by the
WebLogo server (weblogo.berkeley.edu). Position ‘1’ is the ﬁrst residue
of the mature protein. Height of letters is proportional to their informa-
tion content in proﬁle. Information is measured in bits and ranges be-
tween 0 and log2(20)% 4.3. Colour codes cluster residues in apolar
(black), polar (green), positively charged (blue) and negatively charged
(red)

represents the conservation of each residue present in a position
with a letter whose height is proportional to its information con-
tent, ranging from 0 to log220=4.3. It is evident that the pos-
itions neighbouring the cleavage site are slightly more conserved
than the others, although the overall information content is mod-
erate. The most conserved residues are in position —1 and —2,
downstream, and +1 and +2, upstream the cleavage site.

3.2 The automaton for predicting the targeting peptide

We cast the information on the features of targeting peptides in
the automaton described in Figure 4. It comprises 45 states asso-
ciated to the label ‘t’ (targeting states represented with squares)
and 31 states associated to the label ‘n’ (non-targeting states,
represented with circles). The overall model mainly consists of
two sub-models: the grey coloured states describe the 160
N—terminal residues of proteins with targeting peptides and
white coloured states describe the same portion in proteins with-
out targeting peptide.

The sub-model for proteins without targeting peptide consists
of states connected with a dense topology that allows a general
description of a broad range of different sequences.

The sub-model for proteins endowed with targeting peptides is
more speciﬁc and consists of different groups of states aiming at
capturing the modular organization of targeting peptides. As
reported in Section 1, phylogenetic and structural studies recog-
nized a modular architecture in targeting peptides that often
contain two or three separate domains, potentially forming
amphiphilic a-helices or )3—strands when interacting with the or-
ganelle outer membrane (Bruce, 2001; Habib et al., 2007). The
targeting model consists of four modules: (i) the N—terminal
region, probably unstructured and variable in length, is modelled
with a set of densely connected states; (ii) two central domains,
consisting of forward-connected states, aim at capturing the fea-
tures of the modules described in literature; and (iii) the cleavage

site region, where three residues upstream and three residues
downstream are explicitly modelled with six different states. To
model the large variability of targeting peptide lengths, several
states are self-connected. Owing to the overall topology, the
length of predicted targeting peptides spans from 10 to 155 resi-
dues, in agreement with the lengths deduced from the analysis of
our dataset (Fig. 1). As the modular organization cannot be
easily recognized in all the known targeting peptides, the model
topology has to maintain a high ﬂexibility.

Different model topologies have been adopted, and we re-
tained the model best performing on the validation sets. The
performance scores are computed in cross-validation on test
sets independent of both the training and the validation sets.

3.3 Targeting peptide prediction with different inputs

The GRHCRF was trained adopting the strategy described in
Section 2.4 and adopting a 5-fold cross-validation procedure.
Three sets are used for training, one (validation set) for choosing
the best automaton parameters (including the window size and the
input encoding) and the remaining (testing set) for computing the
indexes scoring the performance. As the complete dataset was
reduced for similarity (Section 2.1), this procedure ensures a reli-
able evaluation of the generalization capability of the method.

Table 2 lists the performance scores evaluated on the complete
set (altogether comprising 297 positive and 8010 negative ex-
amples) when different inputs are fed to the GRHCRF. The
single sequence leads to an overall accuracy value (Acc) as
high as 95% and an MCC value equal to 0.50. By incrementally
adding the different features described in Section 2.3, perform-
ance increases on testing sets and reaches the maximum value
when information on sequence, hydrophobicity, charge and
hydrophobic moment of the N—terminal regions are included.
The final performance of TPpred is as high as 96% accuracy
and 0.58 MCC. When proteins belonging to organisms from
different kingdoms are evaluated separately, the MCCs are as
high as 0.74 and 0.52 for plants and non-plants, respectively (for
a more detailed evaluation see Supplementary Table S2).

dataset comprises 297 positive and 8010 negative examples. Scoring indexes are
computed with a 5—fold cross—validation procedure, by collecting the results on
the test sets. For index deﬁnition, see Section 2.4.

To assess the advantage in adopting GRHCRF for predicting
the presence of targeting peptides, we also implemented a pre-
dictor based on an HMM with the same topology described in
Figure 4 and trained on the same dataset. When sequence infor-
mation is adopted as input, the HMM scores with an MCC equal
to 0.39, signiﬁcantly lower than that reached with GRHCRF on
the same input (‘seq’ line in Table 2; see Supplementary Table S3
for a detailed comparison).

3.4 Benchmark with available methods

Table 3 lists the prediction performance of TPpred on the
non-redundant dataset as compared with that of other available
methods predicting both mitochondrial- and plastidic-targeting
peptides. TPpred outperforms all of these methods. When eval-
uated with the Fisher r-to-z transformation (Fisher, 1921), the
difference in MCC between TPpred and the best performing
predictor (Predotar) is significant, with P< 10—4. It is worth noti-
cing that in Table 3, only TPpred is evaluated by adopting a
cross-validation procedure. Indeed, the overlap between the
training datasets of other methods and that adopted for train-
ing/validating TPpred can lead to overestimate the performances
of the other tools.

The low speciﬁcity on the positive class [Sp(+)] is the major
pitfall of all available predictors, probably because of the unbal-
ance in the datasets adopted for training them. TPpred is by far
the most speciﬁc predictor (48%). This is reﬂected in a lower
sensitivity, that, however, reaches a high value [Sn(+)=75%].
Moreover, TPpred scores with an FPR (3%) that is less than a
half with respect to the best available tools. The same trend is
conﬁrmed, when comparing with predictors speciﬁc for mito-
chondria (MitoProt) and plastids (PCLR) (Table 4): also in
this case, TPpred scores with the highest accuracy and MCC.

TPpred scores with a lower sensitivity than other methods and
this corresponds to an increase of the false-negative rate
[FNR= 1 — Sn(+)]. FNR is equal to ~25% for TPpred, higher
than that reported by other methods (7721%). However, when
implementing a prediction method suitable for large-scale anno-
tation of proteins, it is important to keep the error rate as low as
possible in the most abundant class, to keep the number of
wrong predictions low. At the whole-proteome level, proteins
without targeting peptide (the negative set) are by far more

abundant than proteins with targeting peptide (the positive set),
and this is why we consider that the low FPR (that is the rate of
error on the negative set) reported by TPpred is an interesting
feature for its adoption in large-scale analyses.

We also tested the FPRs of predictors on the subset of 1167
negative examples endowed with a transmembrane helix within
the 160 N—terminal residues (last column of Tables 3 and 4). Less
than 2.5% of this set is predicted by TPpred as proteins endowed
with a targeting peptide, and this is the best result obtained with
the currently available methods. This enables TPpred to be safely
adopted for analysing membrane proteins. In particular, when
used as a pre-ﬁlter to identify cleaved peptides, it lowers the risk
of removing N—terminal transmembrane helices.

3.5 Prediction of the cleavage site

TPpred also predicts the position of the cleavage site along the
sequence. This information is important, as it allows knowing the
sequence of the mature and functional protein. Some predictors,
however, do not report it (e.g. Predotar). In Table 5, we com-
paratively assessed the prediction of cleavage site performed with
TPpred, TargetP, PredSL and MitoProt (with the last one, only
on mitochondrial proteins). Mitochondrial and plastidic se-
quences are evaluated separately because of the different average
length of the corresponding targeting peptides (35 and 59 resi-
dues, respectively, see also Section 3.1.1). For each prediction, we
evaluated the error (E) as the difference between the positions of

the real and the predicted cleavage sites. We then computed the
mean error (ME) and the number of prediction for which the
error is lower than the standard deviation (0) of the length dis-
tribution of targeting peptides (E< a score). Standard deviations
are equal to 16 and 22 residues for mitochondria and plastids,
respectively, as discussed in Section 3.1.1. Our TPpred outper-
forms the other methods both in terms of ME and E<o score,
particularly for mitochondria. This indicates that TPpred cor-
rectly predicts the correct length of the targeting peptide, even
if the length distribution is spread.

3.6 Prediction of targeting peptides in whole proteomes

The whole proteomes of three species were downloaded from
EnsEMBL and predicted with TPpred. Results of the prediction
are reported in Table 6. We estimate that 4.0, 9.0 and 6.1% of
proteins are endowed with targeting peptide in human,
Arabidopsis and yeast, respectively. The estimates are somewhat
lower than those previously reported with other methods (ML
25%, Emanuelsson et al., 2000). This result is possibly because of
the low FPR of TPpred (3%) that limits the number of mispre—
dictions in the negative set.

For proteins predicted with targeting peptide, we tested the
compatibility with the GO annotations for cellular component
reported in EnsEMBL and labelled with an experimental evi-
dence code (see Section 2.6). GO terms were divided into three
subsets: (i) terms directly related to mitochondrial or plastidic

localizations; (ii) terms compatible with mitochondrial or plasti-
dic localizations, as they include them as subsets (e.g. cell part,
intracellular, cytoplasm and membrane); and (iii) terms incom-
patible with mitochondrial or plastidic localization.

The results for the three proteomes are reported in Table 7. In
the case of the human proteome, only 12% of the proteins pre-
dicted with targeting peptide are endowed with experimental an-
notation of their localization: 8% of proteins are mitochondrial
and are, therefore, correctly predicted; 4% are localized in other
cellular components (mostly in the nucleus) and can, therefore,

be considered as false predictions. The rate of experimental an-
notation in A.thaliana and yeast is much higher (57 and 67%,
respectively) and mostly conﬁrms the predictions of TPpred: 50
and 56% of proteins predicted with targeting peptide in
Arabidopsis and yeast, respectively, are localized in mitochondria
or plastids. When considering only the set of annotated proteins,
the rates of success in the two well-annotated organisms are,
therefore, 50/57:87% and 56/67:84%, respectively. Proteins
with incompatible localization are, in both organisms, mostly
annotated as nuclear or, in the case of Arabidopsis, as plasma
membrane.

The good agreement between the prediction and the experi-
mental annotations conﬁrms the suitability of TPpred for per-
forming prediction of whole proteomes. In the three analysed
organisms, we also suggest a new annotation for a large
amount of proteins: 3293 in human, 1370 in Arabidopsis and
136 in yeast.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We implemented TPpred, a new predictor for targeting peptides
in mitochondrial and plastidic proteins. TPpred is based on
GRHCRFs, a recently introduced machine-learning approach.
Differently from available methods, it is trained only on experi-
mentally validated targeting peptides. TPpred outperforms other
available methods, both in predicting the presence and the length
of targeting peptides. TPpred is signiﬁcantly more speciﬁc than
the available predictors and scores with a very low-FPR. This
feature makes TPpred useful for predicting the targeting peptides
in proteomes of whole organisms. In particular, when tested on
the proteomes of H.sapiens, A.thaliana and S .cerevisiae, the
estimate of the amount of proteins endowed with targeting pep-
tide is ~L9%. The good agreement between the predictions of
TPpred and the experimental annotations suggests that this
method can be combined with subcellular localization predictors
for improving their performance in genome-wide annotation
procedures.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Whole-genome sequencing of tumor samples has been
demonstrated as an efficient approach for comprehensive analysis of
genomic aberrations in cancer genome. Critical issues such as tumor
impurity and aneuploidy, GC-content and mappability bias have been
reported to complicate identification of copy number alteration and
loss of heterozygosity in complex tumor samples. Therefore, efficient
computational methods are required to address these issues.
Results: We introduce CLImAT (CNA and LOH Assessment in Impure
and Aneuploid Tumors), a bioinformatics tool for identification of
genomic aberrations from tumor samples using whole-genome
sequencing data. Without requiring a matched normal sample,
CLImAT takes integrated analysis of read depth and allelic frequency
and provides extensive data processing procedures including
GC-content and mappability correction of read depth and quantile
normalization of B-allele frequency. CLImAT accurately identiﬁes
copy number alteration and loss of heterozygosity even for highly
impure tumor samples with aneuploidy. We evaluate CLImAT on
both simulated and real DNA sequencing data to demonstrate its
ability to infer tumor impurity and ploidy and identify genomic
aberrations in complex tumor samples.

1 INTRODUCTION

Various aberrations such as ampliﬁcation, deletion and trans-
location of segmental regions are common features of cancer
genomes and play an important role in tumorigenesis and
progression (Albertson et al., 2003; Stratton et al., 2009). It is
reported that dysfunction of oncogene and tumor suppressor
gene is related to frequent genomic aberrations (Bignell et al.,
2010; Stephens et al., 2009; Stratton et al., 2009). Genomic
aberrations in speciﬁc regions have been used as an indicator
of aggressiveness of cancer and clinical outcome (Caren et al.,
2010; Suzuki et al., 2000). Genome-wide copy number alteration

(CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) are two essential
features of cancer genomes, and accurate detection of these
abnormalities is a crucial step to assess genomic aberrations
and cancer-related genes. Experimental technologies are now
available for high-throughput proﬁling of genome-wide aberra-
tions in tumor samples, such as array comparative genomic
hybridization (Park, 2008), single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) genotyping array (Li et al., 2011; Peiffer et al., 2006)
and more recently, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technology
for massively parallel sequencing of DNA (Mardis, 2008;
Metzker, 2009; Morozova and Marra, 2008; Schuster, 2007).
By allowing for comprehensive analysis of genomic aberrations
in cancer genomes, WGS has been demonstrated as an efﬁcient
platform for studies of human cancers (Metzker, 2009).

Although several computational approaches have been
proposed for assessing genomic aberrations from tumor sequen-
cing data (Boeva et al., 2011, 2012; Carter et al., 2012; Gusnanto
et al., 2012; Ha et al., 2012; Mayrhofer et al., 2013;
Sathirapongsasuti et al., 2011; Xi et al., 2011), most of these
methods do not effectively address the critical issues encountered
in interpreting complex tumor samples. For example, tumor
samples are often inﬁltrated with normal stroma, resulting in
inevitable contamination of normal DNA and dilution of
somatic aberration signals (Boeva et al., 2011, 2012; Gusnanto
et al., 2012; Ha et al., 2012; Mayrhofer et al., 2013). Impurity of
tumor sample can significantly alter WGS data; and therefore,
complicates genomic aberration detection, especially when
normal cells dominate in tumor samples. Recent studies, such
as FREEC (Boeva et al., 2011, 2012) and APOLLOH (Ha
et al., 2012), have been proposed to address this issue. FREEC
constructs copy number and B-allele frequency (BAF) proﬁles to
detect CNA and allelic content in cancer genomes, with optional
correction for tumor impurity. APOLLOH is designed for LOH
detection using tumor-normal paired samples, and the issue of
tumor impurity is addressed by a two-component mixture model
for allelic read counts.

In addition to tumor impurity, tumor aneuploidy is another
critical issue in genomic aberration detection, which is caused by
various numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities
frequently observed in cancer genome (Carter et al., 2012).
Although APOLLOH introduces a delicate statistical model to
eliminate the effect of tumor impurity, it does not take account
of tumor aneuploidy in modeling and analyzing tumor WGS
data. To handle aneuploid tumor samples, FREEC provides

an option for users to input tumor ploidy. Currently, automatic
correction for tumor aneuploidy using WGS data still remains a
challenging task. Theoretically, it is often difﬁcult to determine
the actual ploidy of cancer cells by sequencing technology
(Gusnanto et al., 2012). In some particular cases, somatic
aberration signals could present similar characteristics among
genomes of different ploidy (Gusnanto et al., 2012; Oesper
et al., 2013), which makes it hard to accurately estimate the
tumor ploidy. It should be pointed out that, complicated
interpretation of WGS data are even more challenging in
tumor samples confounded by both tumor impurity and aneu-
ploidy, as they usually cannot be solved separately (Oesper et al.,
2013)

So far, only a few algorithms have been proposed for analyz-
ing WGS data of impure tumor samples with aneuploidy (Carter
etaL,2012;(}usnanto etaL,2012;Ddayrhoferetal,2013;()esper
et al., 2013). For example, CNAnorm (Gusnanto et al., 2012)
uses a mixture normal distribution for ratios of tumor-normal
read counts to correct tumor impurity and aneuploidy. However,
CNAnorm assumes that the most common component in the
normal mixture is diploid, which may not hold for aneuploid
tumor samples. Moreover, it cannot detect LOH in cancer
genomes. Another approach, ABSOLUTE (Carter et al., 2012),
is originally introduced to detect CNA from SNP array data by
inferring tumor impurity and ploidy. Although it can be adapted
to analyze DNA sequencing data, a previous study shows that
the underlying statistical models used by ABSOLUTE do not
comprehensively describe the characteristics of DNA sequencing
data and therefore may sometimes gravely misestimate the tumor
impurity and ploidy (Oesper et al., 2013). Recently, Markus et a].
introduced a novel method called Patchwork (Mayrhofer et al.,
2013) for allele-speciﬁc copy number analysis of sequenced
tumor tissue in consideration of tumor impurity and tumor
aneuploidy, which requires intermediate arguments determined
by users. In addition, it is noteworthy that another method called
THetA was proposed recently to analyze tumor sequencing data
(Oesper et al., 2013). THetA mainly focuses on the inference of
cancer subclones in heterogeneous tumor samples and cannot
detect LOH in cancer genomes, as it only utilizes read
count data. Therefore, it is essential to develop an efficient
approach for analysis of tumor sequencing data by comprehen-
sively addressing the challenge of tumor impurity and
aneupkndy.

In this study, we present a novel method called CLImAT
@NA and LOH Assessment in Iﬂpure and Aneuploid
Tumors) to detect genomic aberrations with automatic
correction for both tumor impurity and aneuploidy. Without
requiring a matched normal sample, CLImAT fully explores
both read depth (RD) and allele frequency derived from tumor
WGS data, and provides extensive data processing procedures
including elimination of sequencing/mapping bias and quantile
nonnahzaﬁon UQDD of aﬂeh ﬁequency daur By adopﬁng an
integrated Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that quantitatively
delineates tumor impurity and ploidy, CLImAT provides accur-
ate identiﬁcation of various kinds of genomic aberrations even
for highly impure tumor samples with aneuploidy. We apply
CLImAT to both simulated and real tumor data, and the results
demonstrate the superior performance of CLImAT in analysis of
genomic aberrations using tumor WGS data.

2 METHODS
2.1 Simulated data by sampling reads from tumor-normal
mixture

To assess the performance of CLImAT for complex tumor samples, we
generate simulated tumor samples with different impurity and ploidy.
Similar to the procedure proposed previously (Duan et al., 2013), virtual
tumor-normal mixture experiment is performed on chromosome 20 of
human reference genome (NCBI build 36, hg18) by sampling reads from
a control genome and a test genome with tumor impurity ranging from 0
to 0.9 with 0.1 increments (Supplementary Methods). The test genome is
constructed by dividing the reference genome into 20 non-overlapping
and equally sized segments, which are randomly assigned with particular
kinds of genomic aberrations (Supplementary Figure S1). Sampled reads
from both control and test genome are mapped to the reference using
Bowtie (Langrnead et al., 2009) with default parameters. BAM ﬁles and
pileups are generated by SAMtools (Li et al., 2009). For each
combination of predetermined tumor impurity and ploidy (diploidy,
triploidy and tetraploidy), three BAM ﬁles are generated at 10x, 30x
and 60x sampled coverage, respectively. The average copy number
(ACN) is 2.48, 3.19 and 4.00 for diploid, triploid and tetraploid tumor
samples, respectively. By this way, we generate totally 90 simulated tumor
samples for comprehensive evaluation of prediction performance.
Detailed information about construction of test genomes and read
sampling process is provided in Supplementary Methods.

2.2 Real sequencing data of tumor samples

WGS data from three unpaired primary triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC) samples described in a previous study (Shah et al., 2012) are
adopted in this study. Each sample was sequenced at ~30x coverage on
the Life/ABI SOLID sequencing platform. Reads were mapped to the
reference genome hg18 using BioScope. The data was downloaded from
European Genome-Phenome Archive (EGA) with accession number
EGA800001000132.

2.3 Pipeline of CLImAT

The pipeline of CLImAT is depicted in Supplementary Figure S2. RD
used in this study is retrieved from the BAM ﬁle using SAMtools (Li
et al., 2009) and is further processed to correct GC and mappability bias.
BAF signals of all known SNPs in dbSNP database (Sherry et al., 2001)
are normalized to eliminate allelic bias. Both RD and BAF signals are
modeled by an integrated HMM for identifying genomic aberrations,
including CNA and LOH, and estimating tumor impurity and ploidy.

2.4 Deriving RD and BAF from tumor WGS data

In this study, RD is obtained by counting the reads with starting position
within a 1000-bp window centered at each SNP. For BAF, we count the
reads that override the SNP and the reads with non-reference base at the
corresponding SNP as B allelic read count. Thus, BAF of the SNP is
calculated as the proportion of B allelic reads. Consisted with the
procedure adopted in previous study (Ha et al., 2012), data filtering is
taken to further eliminate positions that have either low depth (<10 reads
for 30/60x coverage and <5 reads for 10x coverage) or high depth (>250
reads).

2.5 Signal correction and normalization

GC-content and mappability may heavily affect RD signals and bring
bias to CNA detection. Therefore, as the ﬁrst step we perform a
correction procedure to remove the bias in RD signals. For each
window used in RD calculation, GC-oontent is measured by calculating
the G -l- C percentage, and the mappability score is deﬁned as the
average of mappability values. The mappability ﬁle used in this study

Z.Yu et al.

 

was obtained from http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hgl8/
encodeDCC/ngncodeMapability/. Following the procedure used in
(Y oon et al., 2009), we scale GC-oontent and mappability score to integer
values between 0 and 100, and perform correction of RD signals using the
following equation:

rdci=rdi  (1)

mx

where rdc, is the corrected RD of the ith window, rd,- is the original RD of
the ith window, m is the overall median RD of all the windows and m X is
the median RD of the windows that have the same GC-oontent and
mappability values as the ith window.

It has been reported that loss of reads (LOR) issue happens in the
alignment step of sequencing data processing (Kim et al., 2013). Indeed,
most aligners, such as BioScope and BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009), have
the preference for aligning reads to reference allele over alternative allele.
Reads sequenced from alternative chromosome are inclined to be
discarded because of mismatches between reference sequence and read
sequence, leading to asymmetrical distribution of allelic frequencies.
Therefore, it is necessary to normalize the BAF data for better estimation
of LOH and other related parameters, including tumor impurity and
ploidy. We adopt an efﬁcient QN (Bolstad et al., 2003) procedure to
address this issue (Supplementary Methods).

2.6 Integrated HMM

We propose an integrated HMM that takes RD and BAF data as input.
Supplementary Table S1 shows the hidden states deﬁned in the HMM
with detailed description of each HMM state regarding copy number,
tumor genotype mutated from normal cell genotype and zygosity status.
Tumor and normal genotype pairs are used to give a detailed View of the
intrinsic relationship between genotypes of tumor and normal cells
admixed in tumor samples. For example, (AAAB, AB) is the case that
tumor genotype ‘AAAB’ is derived from normal cell genotype ‘AB’.

2.6.] Emission probabilities Aligning a read to a genomic position
can be treated as a Bernoulli trial (Ha et al., 2012). Thus, given the
number of reads that override a SNP position, the number of reads
that have non-reference base at corresponding SNP position is modeled
by a binomial distribution. Suppose B allelic read count and total read
count of the ith SNP are b, and Ni, respectively, the observation prob-
ability for hidden state c can be formulated as:

g” Ni , bi V (Ni-7b,)
 le (we) 
k: 1 L'

[)1 ye

where gc is the number of tumor genotypes included in state c. The ACN
yc and average B allele copy number zck for state c are deﬁned as:

ye =ns ‘ Ws + "C ‘  _ Ws) 

Zak = ns/l'sWs + "Eureka _ WK) 

where n), is the normal copy number and is ﬁxed to 2 in this study, nc is
the tumor copy number in state c and W, is the level of tumor impurity. u,
denotes expected BAF value of normal cells and is ﬁxed to 0.5, and uck
represents the expected BAF value of the kth tumor genotype in state c.

Taking into account the over-dispersed distribution of RD values
(Anders and Huber, 2010), we use a negative binomial distribution to
model RD signals. Suppose that RD of the ith SNP is d,, the observation
probability for hidden state c can be formulated as:

F(di+ have)

[,6 mega

)(1 —p.) we ’12:?" (5)

p(d,- l w... o, m, c)= —,,
r(d,- + 1)r(—C<P:I’c)

where 1" is the gamma function and [76 is a parameter of negative binomial

distribution deﬁned as the probability of success. The average read count
A, for state c is deﬁned as:

A, = & A + 0 (6)
2
where A is the mean value of copy neutral read count and varies with
respect to tumor ploidy change. 0 accounts for background RD noise
resulted from sequencing error and wrongly mapped reads.

2.6.2 EM algorithm for parameter estimation We employ expect-
ation maximization (EM) algorithm for HMM training and parameter
estimation. In the expectation step, the expectation of the partial log-
likelihood of BAF is formulated as:

N C go Ni
E(LL;.) = ZZn—(oZ (Iog(( b 
k=1 ,-

i=lL'=l

+b,log(zi) -l-(N,- — b,)log(l — 
ya ya

where y,(c) represents the posterior probability that the ith SNP is in state
c and is calculated by the forward-backward algorithm (Rabiner, 1989).
Similarly, the expectation of the partial log-likelihood function of RD can
be formulated as:

(7)

N C
E(LL4) = ZZn—(cﬂog (pol,- l w... o, m, c»

i=lL'=l

log(l‘(d,—+ —A”(1 _p”))) +d,-log(p,.)

i=lL'=l

In the maximization step of the EM algorithm, we use Newton algo-
rithm to update the parameters in emission probabilities. For example,
during iteration n we update the parameter w, by using the following
formula:

6E(LL},) + 6E(LLd)

_ 6w 6w
WW“ T W3," _ 62E(LL;,) + slam) (9)
61w w

All the parameters are iteratively updated until the EM algorithm
converges. Copy number and tumor genotype for each SNP are deter-
mined by the hidden state with the largest conditional probability. In
addition, post—processing is performed for copy number annotation of
highly ampliﬁed regions (copy number >7) according to the mean RD
values of all SNPs within these regions (Supplementary Methods). To
evaluate the reliability of CLImAT results, we also calculate a reliability
score for each region to measure how well the data ﬁt to the model
(Supplementary Methods).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Correction and normalization of RD and BAF signals

We assess the performance of GC—content and mappability
correction and plot the distribution of RD with respect to GC-
content and mappability score for 173 copies (Supplementary
Figure S3). Before correction, RD signals demonstrate a
unimodal distribution with respect to GC—content and are posi-
tively correlated with mappability scores. After correction both

CLImAT

 

GC-content and mappability bias is signiﬁcantly eliminated.
Further investigation suggests the order of GC-content and
mappability correction performed to tumor WGS data
affects the final results and simultaneous correction for both
GC-content and mappability bias shows better performance
(Supplementary Figure S4).

It is observed that owing to LOR issue BAF plots of tumor
samples display asymmetrical bands positioned around 0.5
(Supplementary Figure SSA). The altered distribution of BAF
signals seriously hampers accurate identiﬁcation of genomic
aberrations in tumor samples. After applying the ON procedure,
BAF signals are largely corrected with symmetrical bands
positioned around 0.5 (Supplementary Figure S5B).

3.2 Appling CLImAT to simulated data

We apply CLImAT to simulated tumor data, and the results are
shown in Supplementary Figure S6. The RD and BAF signals
vary dramatically with increased tumor impurity for both diploid
and triploid genomes. Especially, with 90% normal cells admixed
in the tumor sample, both RD and BAF signals for aberrant
regions are dramatically attenuated. CLImAT correctly detects
all aberrant regions and provides CNA and LOH prediction with
reasonable performance.

3.2.] Estimation of tumor impurity and ploidy We examine
tumor impurity estimated by CLImAT and ABSOLUTE
(Carter et al., 2012) on simulated data, and the results of
tumor samples at 60x coverage are shown in Figure 1A.
CLImAT accurately estimates tumor impurity from 0 to 0.9
with signiﬁcant correlation with the ground truth (correlation
coefﬁcient = 0.999, P = 6.24 x 10’21 for diploid samples, correl-
ation coefﬁcient = 0.999, P = 2.75 x 10’12 for triploid samples
and correlation coefﬁcient = 0.999, P = 1.42 x 10’11 for tetra-
ploid samples), indicating CLImAT can precisely recover the

proportion of cancer cells in tumor samples. In contrast,
the performance of ABSOLUTE is not optimal and sometimes
the results obviously deviate from the ground truth. Similar
results are observed for simulated samples at 30x coverage
(Supplementary Figure S7). To assess the performance of
tumor ploidy estimation, we calculate the ACNs for simulated
samples from the results of ABSOLUTE and CLImAT. As
shown in Figure 1B, CLImAT exhibits prominent advantage
over ABSOLUTE in estimating tumor ploidy. For example,
CLImAT correctly identify all diploid samples at 30x coverage
as diploidy, whereas ABSOLUTE tends to assign them as hyper-
ploidy. Taken together, these results suggest that CLImAT can
efﬁciently estimate both tumor impurity and tumor ploidy from
complicated tumor samples.

3.2.2 LOH and CNA detection We adopt the performance
evaluation procedure proposed in APOLLOH (Ha et al.,
2012), in which all the calls of the informative (heterozygous)
positions are used as the golden standard to compare the abilities
of different computational methods in detecting genomic aber-
rations. Accordingly, the CNA/LOH calls of heterozygous pos-
itions pre-determined in unpaired simulated data are treated as
the ground truth. We use the standard way for performance
evaluation by separately comparing the results of the computa-
tional methods investigated in this study to the ground truth in
terms of sensitivity and speciﬁcity (more details of performance
evaluation are provided in Supplementary Methods). The LOH
detection results of three computational methods, FREEC
(Boeva et al., 2012), SNVMix (Goya et al., 2010) and
CLImAT, are shown in Figure 2. For diploid tumor samples
(Fig. 2A), FREEC shows high speciﬁcity in all tests and the
sensitivity is generally good at medium tumor impurity levels.
Compared with the other methods, CLImAT demonstrates
strong robustness to tumor impurity and maintains high sensi-
tivity (>0.99) across all tumor samples with impurity level <0.9.

It also keeps consistent high speciﬁcity with respect to different
tumor impurity levels (<08) and sampled coverage. Similar
results are observed for triploid and tetraploid tumor samples
(Fig. 2B and C).

Next, CNA detection performance is evaluated for FREEC
and CLImAT, and the results suggest that FREEC has good
performance for diploid tumor samples when tumor impurity
is <0.5 (Supplementary Figure S8A). At larger tumor impurity
levels, the sensitivity decreases while the speciﬁcity remains high.
With similar speciﬁcity across all impurity levels, CLImAT is
able to retain high sensitivity (>0.99) when the tumor impurity
is <0.9. For triploid and tetraploid tumor samples
(Supplementary Figure S8B and C), CLImAT also performs
well in identifying CNA regions. At the same time, we investigate
the performance of Patchwork, and results of simulated tumor
samples are shown in Table S2. We ﬁnd that in general both
Patchwork and CLImAT can provide accurate aberration detec-
tion with similar performance, if the intermediate arguments of
Patchwork are correctly determined by the user. Furthermore,
we test CLImAT on low-coverage sequencing data, and the
results for simulated data with 10x coverage suggest that
CLImAT may also be applied to low coverage tumor WGS
data when tumor impurity level is not high (Supplementary
Figure S9).

In addition to aberration detection for tumor samples, we
examine the reliability score (Supplementary Methods) that is
used to measure how well the data fits to the model. For simu-
lated tumor data with two cancer subclones (Supplementary
Figure S10), the reliability score for the heterogeneous region is
signiﬁcantly lower than those of other homogeneous regions,
suggesting it can help the user to evaluate the fitness of the
model and provide better interpretation of the results.

3.3 Applying CLImAT to TNBC samples

Three TNBC samples sequenced at ~30x coverage are adopted
to examine the performance of CLImAT, which are also assayed
by Affymetrix SNP6.0 array for comparison. By using ASCAT
(Van Loo et al., 2010), the results generated from SNP arrays are
used as the ground truth. We ﬁrst evaluate ACN and impurity of
these tumor samples using different methods, and the results are
shown in Table 1. From the results of ASCAT, sample 1 is
identiﬁed as aneuploid tumor, whereas samples 2 and 3 are iden-
tiﬁed as hyperploid tumors. Tumor sample 1 demonstrates
genome-wide deletions with ACN of 1.67, whereas tumor sam-
ples 2 and 3 include dramatic ampliﬁcations along the whole
cancer genome, with ACN of 3.02 and 4.16, respectively.
CLImAT provides consistent estimation of ACN for the three
tumor samples. Also, the tumor impurity levels estimated by
CLImAT are in good concordance with the ground truth.
These results suggest CLImAT has the potential for automatic-
ally identifying and correcting for tumor impurity and aneu-
ploidy in complicated tumor samples.

Next, we examine LOH detection performance of FREEC,
CLImAT and SNVMix (Fig. 3). The same performance evalu-
ation procedure for simulated data analysis is adopted here, and
the CNA/LOH calls of heterozygous positions recognized by
ASCAT are treated as the ground truth (Supplementary
Methods). For all three tumor samples, CLImAT compares
favorably to SNVMix and FREEC. It achieves superior sensitiv-
ity of 0.98, 0.97 and 0.94 for samples 1, 2 and 3, respectively, with
speciﬁcity better than or comparable with those of the other
methods. We also examine the performance of CNA detection,
and the results in Supplementary Table S3 show CLImAT has
high consistency with ASCAT. Furthermore, Figure 4 illustrates
the WGS and SNP array data for chromosome 8, 13 and 14 of

Fig. 3. LOH detection performance for primary TNBC samples. LOH
detected by ASCAT from Affymetrix SNP6.0 arrays is used as ground
truth

tumor sample 1, in which both BAF and LRR/RD signals
generated from different platforms show similar patterns on
aberrant regions. Both CLImAT and ASCAT identify consecu-
tive LOH regions spanning chromosomes 8, 13 and 14,
board hemizygous deletions on 8p(11.23722), 8q(11.21722.1),
13q(21.2731.3), 14p(11.1712) and 14q(21.3723.1, 23.27233 and
32.13732.33), and board ampliﬁcations on chromosome
13q(12.11713.3 and 32.1734). In addition, beneﬁted from high
resolution of WGS platform, CLImAT provide more precise
detection of small focal aberrations than ASCAT. For example,
on 8p23 ASCAT only detects one homozygous deletion whereas
CLImAT identify two additional homozygous deletion regions
on 8p23.1, which harbors a potential tumor suppressor gene
PinXl related to telomerase activity and chromosome stability
(Zhou et al., 2011).

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Featured with ﬁner resolution than previous genomic technolo-
gies, WGS allows more comprehensive analysis of tumor aber-
rations. In this study, we introduce an efficient computational
approach for this purpose, which presents remarkable advan-
tages over existing methods for interpretation of complicated
tumor samples without prior knowledge of tumor impurity and
ploidy. One advantage of CLImAT is the correction and nor-
malization procedure for improving data quality of unpaired
tumor samples. For example, BAF is normalized in CLImAT
for elimination of LOR bias, which is indispensible for further

statistical modeling analysis of WGS data. GC—content and
mappability correction of RD is also a crucial step for detecting
aberrations in unpaired tumor samples.

Another advantage of CLImAT lies in the fact that it takes
integrated analysis of RD and BAF using a novel HMM to
provide accurate detection of genome-wide aberrations in
tumor samples. The emission probabilities of HMM used in
CLImAT give comprehensive description of the statistical behav-
ior of sequencing data generated from tumor samples. Unlike
previous approaches using Poisson distributions, more ﬂexible
negative binomial distribution is adopted to model over-
dispersed RD signals. Moreover, the relevant parameters includ-
ing tumor impurity and ploidy are automatically estimated by
EM algorithm. These approaches ensure the performance of
CLImAT for complex tumor samples.

Despite of the advantages mentioned above, CLImAT also
has limitations in modeling and analysis of tumor sequencing
data. First, CLImAT cannot be applied to exome-sequencing
data, as it is originally designed to deal with unpaired WGS
data. Second, although >2.6 million SNPs are investigated in
CLImAT and only 1.5% adjacent SNPs have relatively large
distance (>5 kb), the resolution of CLImAT may still be limited
by genomic breakpoints that lie between SNPs. To further im-
prove the resolution of CLImAT, we provide an option to esti-
mate copy number for the regions between distant SNPs (>1 kb)
by calculating the corresponding RD signals (Supplementary
Methods). Third, CLImAT does not account for the issue of
tumor heterogeneity (Mayrhofer et al., 2013; Oesper et al.,
2013). The basic assumption adopted in CLImAT is that there
is a single copy number for all tumor cells, which will not hold if
multiple subclones exist in a tumor sample. Recently, Oesper
et a]. investigated tumor heterogeneity using DNA sequencing
data and showed that multiple tumor subclones may often exist
in tumor samples (Oesper et al., 2013), suggesting that tumor
heterogeneity is another key factor in interpreting tumor sequen-
cing data. In heterogeneous tumor samples, the somatic aberrant
signals derived from tumor sequencing data can be complicated,
which makes it hard to deconvolute subclonal aberrations.
Therefore, more advanced methods are required to assess
tumor heterogeneity in tumor sequencing data.

In conclusion, we present CLImAT, an efﬁcient and powerful
bioinformatics tool, for detection of genomic aberrations using
tumor WGS data. We expect it will be helpful for comprehensive
interpretation of cancer genome and show its potential usefulness
in clinical diagnosis and treatment for cancers.

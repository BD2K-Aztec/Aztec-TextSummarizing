ABSTRACT

Summary: Computational gene function prediction can serve to
focus experimental resources on high-priority experimental tasks.
FuncBase is a web resource for viewing quantitative machine
learning-based gene function annotations. Quantitative annotations
of genes, including fungal and mammalian genes, with Gene
Ontology terms are accompanied by a community feedback system.
Evidence underlying function annotations is shown. For example, a
custom Cytoscape viewer shows functional linkage graphs relevant
to the gene or function of interest. FuncBase provides links to
external resources, and may be accessed directly or via links from
species-specific databases.

Availability: FuncBase as well as all underlying data and annotations
are freely available via http://func.med.harvard.edu/

1 INTRODUCTION

Computational prediction—e.g. of gene function, gene phenotype,
protein interactions or genetic interactions—offers a statistically
sound form of triage for reducing experimental tasks that would
be prohibitive otherwise. For example, in genetic disease mapping,
a candidate gene approach can reduce the study size required
to establish signiﬁcance. This is critically important, since large
association studies are costly and may be infeasible for rare
diseases. Functions are commonly represented by Gene Ontology
(GO; Ashbumer et (11., 2000) terms, which encompass molecular
functions, cellular locations and biological processes.

Experimentalists differ in their requirements for function
prediction. To maximize new discoveries, some will wish to cast
a wide net that may include many false positives. Others, for whom
follow-up experiments are more resource-intensive, will wish to
proceed conservatively. Therefore, FuncBase displays quantitative
conﬁdence measures by which predictions may be ranked. Because
users typically have additional domain knowledge that they can draw
upon to ﬁlter out unlikely predictions, FuncBase shows predictions
in the context of underlying evidence.

FuncBase currently displays ﬁinction annotations for several
species. For each species, annotations are based on machine learning
algorithms applied to an integrated data collection including protein
motif annotation, phenotype and disease association, phylogenetic
proﬁles, protein interactions and gene expression. Full descriptions
for the underlying machine learning algorithm are provided in Tian
et (11. (2008), Pena-Castillo et (11. (2008) and Tasan et (11. (2008).

2 BACKGROUND

For each gene-function pair examined, a gene ﬁinction prediction
algorithm may provide a binary ‘black or white’ classiﬁcation, a
ranking or a quantitative conﬁdence measure.

Interfaces displaying gene function predictions currently take one
of three forms. In the ﬁrst form, binary calls are incorporated into
an existing species-speciﬁc database, such as the Saccharomyces
Genome Database (SGD; Cherry et (11., 1998) or the Mouse Genome
Informatics resource (MGI; Bult et (11., 2008). While ‘black or
white’ calls are useful for archiving accepted knowledge about
gene ﬁinction, they are incomplete guides to grey areas of current
knowledge.

The second form of interface enables users to apply prediction
algorithms to datasets provided by the user. This second form is
taken by such websites as GeneMANIA (Mostafavi et (11., 2008)
and VIRGO (Massjouni et (11., 2006).

A third form, represented by FuncBase, STRING (von Mering
et (11., 2007) and BioPIXIE (Myers et (11., 2005), is a browser of
precalculated predictions ranked by conﬁdence score, together with
their literature veriﬁcation status. Relaxing the requirement that
quantitative predictions be generated ‘on the ﬂy’ allows use of more
computationally intensive prediction algorithms.

3 FEATURES

View predictions by gene or function: Predictions in FuncBase
can be viewed either by function (GO term) or by gene. Users
may search for their gene or function using a rich search syntax
(Section 4) permitting entry of gene or protein synonyms from
multiple identiﬁer systems, and text-matching within gene or
function descriptions (Fig. 1A).

Both ﬁinction and gene views (examples shown in Figs 1B and C)
allow predictions to be sorted by the conﬁdence score from any
available prediction method. GO annotations previously assigned

Fig. 1. Search (A) for an annotation report of a GO term (B) or gene (C). GO
term reports show evidence of functional relationships (D) and function-
related gene properties (E). The user may provide opinions (F) on any
quantitative annotation. Gene reports also present evidence based on
functional relationships (G).

by the corresponding species-speciﬁc authority are displayed next
to each prediction.

View supporting evidence: Users may wish to further ﬁlter
quantitative annotations based on their domain knowledge.
Therefore, FuncBase displays key pieces of evidence underlying
annotations.

Some annotation algorithms take a guilt-by-proﬁling approach—
e.g. genes involved in ‘negative regulation of microtubule
polymerization or depolymerization’ (GO:003 l l l I) tend to contain
a DH protein domain (InterPro pattern IPR000219). Therefore, each
ﬁinction View displays the gene properties that are most predictive of
that ﬁinction. A table (Fig. 1E), available by clicking an annotation
row, indicates all properties held by the corresponding gene.

Some annotation algorithms take a guilt-by-association approach,

in which GO annotations are ‘transferred’ between genes with
evidence of a functional relationship (e.g. physical interaction
between the corresponding proteins). Different variants of the
ﬁinctional linkage graphs are appropriate for different GO terms
(see Tasan et (11., 2008 and Tian et (11., 2008), so in function views
one graph is displayed (Fig. 1D), and in gene views FuncBase three
ﬁinctional linkage graph versions are shown that correspond to the
three branches of the GO (Fig. 1G). Functional linkage graphs can
be viewed in FuncBase as static images, or manipulated within
Cytoscape (Shannon et (11., 2003).
Quantitative annotations from multiple sources: A unique feature
of FuncBase is its ability to accommodate prediction sets from
multiple bioinformatics teams differing by input data or algorithm.
For example, 10 prediction sets are available for Mus musculus. We
invite others to submit predictions associated with peer-reviewed
publications for sharing via FuncBase.

User feedback: FuncBase is governed by the philosophy that
annotation in general and predictive annotation in particular is a
work in progress, and that users will often bring domain knowledge
that supersedes current or predicted annotation. Therefore, for every
gene/function combination displayed, a form invites expert users to
provide feedback on whether they agree, disagree or are uncertain
about this annotation (Fig. 1F). Free text notes can be attached to any
opinion. Current tallies of true and false responses are shared among
all users and made available in summary form to the appropriate
species authority. Community feedback on predictions gathered and
shared in real time is novel to the FuncBase quantitative annotation
resource.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

The back-end of FuncBase consists of the Pylons MVC framework,
the Lucene search provider and the PostgreSQL database server.
The front-end uses ExtJS (Javascript) and a modiﬁed version of
Cytoscape 2.6. Most web site actions are accomplished through
asynchronous browser—server communication. Functional linkage
graph layout is via BioLayoutKK within Cytoscape, using linkage
certainties as edge weights.

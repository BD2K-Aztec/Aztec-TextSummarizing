ABSTRACT

Summary: Assessing and improving the safety of chemicals and the
efficacy of drugs depends on an understanding of the biodistribution,
clearance and biological effects of the chemical(s) of interest. A pro-
mising methodology for the prediction of these phenomena is physio-
logically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling, which
centers on the prediction of chemical absorption, distribution, metab-
olism and excretion (pharmacokinetics) and the biological effects
(pharmacodynamics) of the chemical on the organism. Strengths of
this methodology include modeling across multiple scales of biological
organization and facilitate the extrapolation of results across routes of
exposure, dosing levels and species. It is also useful as the foundation
for tools to (i) predict biomarker levels (concentrations of chemical
species found in the body that indicate exposure to a foreign chem-
ical), given a chemical dose or exposure; (ii) reconstruct a dose, given
the levels of relevant biomarkers; and (iii) estimate population variabil-
ity. Despite the importance and promise of physiologically based phar-
macokinetic /pharmacodynamics-based approaches to forward and
reverse dosimetry, there is currently a lack of user-friendly, freely avail-
able implementations that are accessible and useful to a broad range
of users. DoseSim was developed to begin to fill this gap.

1 INTRODUCTION

The rational design of drugs and drug dosing regimens, and the
risk and safety assessment for environmental toxicants, depend
on an understanding of the pharmacokinetics and pharmaco-
dynamics (PK/PD) of the chemicals of interest. A methodology
that is increasingly used for PK/PD analyses is physiologically
based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling (Reisfeld et al., 2007).
PBPK models integrate information across multiple time and
spatial scales through the speciﬁcation of biological, biochemical
and physiological information at the tissue, organism and popu-
lation levels. These models can then be used to predict the ab-
sorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion and potential
biological effects of chemicals to the exposed individual.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed

Moreover, through the use of appropriate parameter values,
these models have the ability to extrapolate across doses,
routes of administration and species.

The prediction of absorption, distribution, metabolism and ex-
cretion and biodistribution of the chemical and its metabolites,
given an applied dose or exposure, is often known as forward
dosimetry. The reverse case, in which biomarker levels are used to
estimate the applied dose or exposure, is often known as dose
reconstruction or reverse dosimetry (Lyons et al., 2008).

Despite the increasing use of forward dosimetry and dose re-
construction in risk and safety assessment, few tools are available
to conduct both types of analyses in an integrated manner.
Moreover, the tools that are available are generally difficult to
use by non-technical users and/or are proprietary.

To ﬁll this gap, we developed the software framework
DoseSim. The principal design objectives for this application
were that it would (i) allow the user to perform forward dosim-
etry, forward dosimetry with Monte Carlo and dose reconstruc-
tion analyses; (ii) be easy to use for non-technical people;
(iii) facilitate simple analyses and Viewing of results without the
need for additional software packages; (iv) allow alternative
chemical-speciﬁc models to be used in this general framework;
and (V) be freely available to the scientiﬁc and regulatory
communities.

In this article, we describe the implementation, structure and
features of DoseSim. DoseSim20P, a speciﬁc application package
[DoseSim plus a specialized PBPK/PD module focused on the
analysis of binary mixtures of organophosphorus insecticides], is
presented in Supplementary Information.

2 METHODS

DoseSim comprises a computational engine, a speciﬁc PBPK/PD model
and a GUI layer. The computational engine behind the framework is
MCSim (Bois, 2009) (https://www.gnu.org/s/mcsim/mcsim.html), a simu-
lation package written in ANSI-standard C that facilitates the analysis of
statistical or simulation models and performs Monte Carlo (MC) stochas-
tic simulations and Bayesian inference through Markov chain Monte
Carlo simulations. A number of changes were made to the publicly dis-
tributed version of MCSim (v5.1.0) to make it compatible with the struc-
ture and aims of DoseSim.

The underlying PBPK/PD models, generally consisting of systems of
ordinary differential equations, were ﬁrst written in the domain-speciﬁc
language of MCSim (Bois, 2009) and were then compiled to C and linked
to relevant libraries using MCSim utilities.

of statistical distributions are available to the user through a drop-down
menu

The DoseSim GUI and interface layer to MCSim were written in ISO/
IEC2003 C++, making use of the wxWidgets library (v2.8.1 1). Statistical
analyses of the simulation output were enabled using functions in the
GNU Scientiﬁc Libraries, and plotting functionality was implemented
using wxMathPlot. The various property sheets for parameter input are
stored as XML and are automatically updated to accommodate changes
in the underlying model structure. Project ﬁles are serialized as XML that
can be modiﬁed outside of the GUI if desired.

Program Functionality: In DoseSim, the GUI interface allows easy
simulation setup, running and analyses. Information is organized into
Projects. Within a Project is one or more Experiments. Experiments are
generally created, run and analysed using the following procedure: Begin
a new Experiment and enter relevant parameters: The user selects the type
of simulation and enters relevant parameters (or parameter distributions)
through a tab-base interface (Fig. 1). Run the experiment: Once param-
eters and simulation sets have been input, the Experiment, which may
comprise multiple simulations, is selected and run. View the results:
Following completion of the simulation, results can be inspected and
simulation results displayed in a variety of formats, including plots for
MC simulations that display the envelope of the entire range of results
along with mean values. Save and export the results: Following the simu-
lations, results can be saved to the native XML format or exported to
comma-separated value format for postprocessing, visualization and
archiving with other tools.

3 DISCUSSION

3.1 Comparison with existing software

To our knowledge, there are no other software applications that
ﬁt the design objectives and needs noted earlier. A non-exhaustive

list of applications that can be programmed to do at least forward
dosimetry (+MC) and dose reconstruction simulations include
the following: acle (http://www.acslx.com/): proprietary soft-
ware, command—line and GUI based. MATLAB (http://www.
mathworks.com/products/matlab/index.html): proprietary soft-
ware, command—line based, a selection of toolboxes for various
types of analyses can be purchased from the vendor or down-
loaded from various repositories. MCSim (https://www.gnu.org/
s/mcsim/mcsim.html): GNU General Public License, command-
line based. R (http://www.r-project.org/): GNU General Public
License, command-line based; a large selection of analysis and
plotting packages can be obtained freely. WinBugs (http://www.
mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/bugs/winbugs/contents.shtml): WinBUGS
License, command-line based, several interfaces (Pharmaco,
WBDiff) are available to extend the basic functionality. xmcsim
(https://www.gnu.org/s/mcsim/mcsim.html): GNU General
Public License, menu-driven GUI for MCSim (but requiring the
installation of additional software).

Consistent with the design objectives described earlier,
DoseSim has built-in functionality for forward dosimetry and
dose reconstruction simulations and can perform simulations
using a variety of statistical distributions. It is a GUI-driven ap-
plication, containing familiar dialogs, widgets and spreadsheet-
like grids for parameter and simulation speciﬁcation. The inter-
face contains flexible methods for specifying the dosing or expos-
ure regimen and the sets of biomarkers for dose reconstruction
simulations. Post-processing of results is facilitated through
interactive plotting and convenient data export.

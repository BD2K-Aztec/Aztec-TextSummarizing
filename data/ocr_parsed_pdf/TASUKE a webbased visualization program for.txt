ABSTRACT

Summary: Because an enormous amount of sequence data is being
collected, a method to effectively display sequence variation informa-
tion is urgently needed. TASUKE is a web application that visualizes
large-scale resequencing data generated by next-generation sequen-
cing technologies and is suitable for rapid data release to the public
on the web. The variation and read depths of multiple genomes,
as well as annotations, can be shown simultaneously at various
scales. We demonstrate the use of TASUKE by applying it to 50 rice
and 100 human genome resequencing datasets.

Availability and implementation: The TASUKE program package and
user manual are available from http://tasuke.dna.affrc.go.jp/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) tech-
nologies have allowed the rapid production of a tremendous
amount of genomic sequence data at a low cost. This has
naturally led to the resequencing of hundreds or thousands of
genomes, such as the 1000 human genomes (http://www.1000
genomes.org/) and the 1001 genomes project in Arabidopsis
(http://www.1001genomes.org/). A method for comparing
dozens of genomes in an effective manner is, therefore, urgently
needed. Although a few stand-alone programs for comparative
genome Visualization have been developed (Fiume et al., 2010;
Preston et al., 2012; Thorvaldsdottir et al., 2013), to our know-
ledge, there is no web-based application that can handle
dozens or more resequencing data of large genomes from
higher eukaryotes.

The basic requirements of a Visualization program for
genome-wide resequencing data are as follows. First, a large
amount of data obtained from tens or hundreds of samples
from a species with genomes of >100 Mb need to be displayed
in a smooth manner. An overview of NGS read mapping results
needs to be shown so that users can grasp read coverage of a
genome at the hundred- to million-base scale at a glance. Second,
the use of storage and memory resources for the data browser
should be minimal and small enough to be handled by the

average computer server. It is not realistic to load an enormous
amount of mapped read data from individual samples one by
one with a stand-alone program on PC. Therefore, a client-server
system, in which an efficient program runs on the server, is pre-
ferred. Third, it should be possible to share the data with collab-
orators or the public. In general, data from resequencing studies
that are published as figures and tables in an article are not
sufﬁcient to reproduce a study’s results, whereas raw short
reads registered in sequence read archive databases and resultant
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data are informative. For
experimental researchers who seek polymorphisms at the
genome-wide level, a browser that can effectively address hun-
dreds of genomes and display a large number of polymorphic
sites is needed.

Here, we present TASUKE, a web application for the Visualiza-
tion of large-scale resequencing data obtained from at least
100 genomes. This application allows users to rapidly release
their own data on the web. Variant frequencies, read coverage
and gene annotation information are shown simultaneously at
various scales. TASUKE uses a window analysis so that users can
get a bird’s-eye View of the SNP density.

2 FUNCTIONS AND APPLICATION

For the sake of ease of use, TASUKE was designed as web appli-
cation implemented in HTMLS. In this way, researchers can
easily share data Via general web browsers using a graphical
interface. The input files required are as follows: a reference
genome in FASTA format, Variant Call Format (VCF) ﬁles
(Danecek et al., 2011) and depth ﬁles created by the ‘depth’
command of SAMtools (Li et al., 2009). Annotation files in
General Feature Format (GFF, http://www.sanger.ac.uk/re
sources/software/gff/) are optional. A MySQL database is also
required for the website’s backend data management. TASUKE
helps bioinformatics researchers of genome-wide resequencing
projects to Visualize a large amount of polymorphisms on mul-
tiple genomes and to release the data to the public.

On the upper pane, the reference genome and annotation in-
formation are displayed (Fig. 1b and c). Users can choose a
speciﬁc position by clicking on the selected chromosome or
moving a slider in the upper right region. Alternatively, the top
menu bar provides users with a search function to find identiﬁers
or genomic positions (Fig. 1a). Nucleotide variations (SNPs and
length polymorphisms) and depth of mapped reads are presented
in the lower main pane, which can be dragged to the left or right
(Fig. 1e). The depth information is important to distinguish

whether the region has no SNPs or no mapped reads, which are
generally omitted in VCF format. The frequency of variation
occurrence and/or average depth are shown in a block that cor-
responds to a region scalable from 1 bp to 100 kb with colored
gradations: blue for SNPs, red for insertions/deletions and gray
or yellow for depth (Fig. If). The maximum number of blocks
displayed in a window is 200, so that up to 20 Mb can be Viewed.
At the most precise level, individual nucleotides and translated
amino acids can be shown (Fig. 1B). By clicking on a block, a
window of detailed information about nucleotide variations and
depth pops up (Fig. 11). To ﬁnd mutations that possibly affect
phenotypes, the effect information of each variant, such as non-
synonymous changes and frame shifts, which can be added to a
VCF ﬁle by sanff (Cingolani et al., 2012), is shown by selecting
‘sanFF’ in the menu bar (Fig. 11 and m). If a sample name is
clicked, the reference genome is reset to the selected sample and
variant frequencies are recalculated for all genomes. This refer-
ence switch function is useful to look over variations derived
from different origins. From the ‘Tools’ menu (Fig. 1a), users
can export a list of variant information, which is described in a
tab-delimited ﬁle of a speciﬁed region of up to 200 kb. An image
ﬁle of the displayed area is also downloadable.

As a demonstration, we applied TASUKE to resequencing data
from rice and human samples so that users can experience the
functions of TASUKE. First, we used resequencing data from
50 rice genomes at ~15x coverage 0(u et al., 2011), which was
downloaded from the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (Kodama
et al., 2010). The short-reads of rice were mapped to the reference
genome (Sakai et al., 2013) by BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009).
Second, alignments of human genome resequencing data
generated by the 1000 Genomes Project were downloaded
(ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/), and 100 individ-
uals who represent subpopulations were arbitrarily selected.
Variant and read depth information were obtained from both
datasets by using SAMtools. The annotations from the Rice
Annotation Project Database (Sakai et al., 2013) and Ensembl
(Flicek et al., 2013) were also stored in MySQL databases. These
datasets are accessible through TASUKE at http://tasuke.dna.affrc.

3 CONCLUSION

TASUKE is designed for the Visualization and rapid release of
large-scale resequencing data on the web. This application
allows users to see variant frequencies, read depth and annota-
tion information in a scalable and smooth manner. We demon-
strated its functionality through application to resequencing data
from the rice and human genomes. This application is useful
for the analysis of other genome-wide NGS data obtained
from large samples. In future, to cope with growing resequencing
data as well as RNA-seq and other NGS data, we will further
improve TASUKE.

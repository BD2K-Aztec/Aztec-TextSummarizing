ChemoPy can compute a large number of 2D and 3D descrip—
tors. A list of structural and physicochemical features covered by
ChemoPy is summarized in Table 1 (see also detailed descriptor
list in Supplementary Material Sl). There are two means to com—
pute these molecular descriptors from small molecules. One is to
use the built—in modules. There exist 19 modules responding to
the calculation of descriptors from 16 feature groups. The in—
struction for each module is provided in the form of HTML in
ChemoPy (see Supplementary Material S2). We could import
related functions to compute these features. For example, the
topology module includes a number of functionalities used for
calculating various topological descriptors. The user could con—
veniently use them as need.

>>> from pychempychem import Chem, topology
>>> mol 2 Chem.MolFromSmiles(“CC(Oclccccch(O)=O)=O”)
>>> Weiner = topology.CalculateWeiner(mol)

>>> Alltopology = topology.GetTopology(mol)

The other is to call the PyChem2d or PyChem3d class by im—
porting the pychem module, which encapsulates commonly used
descriptor calculation methods. PyChem2d and PyChem3d are
responsible for the calculation of 2D and 3D molecular descrip—
tors, respectively. We could construct a PyChem2d or
PyChem3d object with a molecule input and then call corres—
ponding methods to calculate these features.

>>> from pychempychem import PyChem2d, PyChem3d
>>> desl = PyChem2d()

>>> desl .ReadMolFromSmile(“CC(Oclccccch(O)=O)=O”)
>>> AllConnectivity = desl.GetConnectivity()

>>> des2 = PyChem3d()

>>> des2.ReadMol(“CC(Oclccccch(O)=O)=O”)

>>> All3D = des2.GetAllDescriptor()

In ChemoPy, molecular structures are optimized by the AMI
method in MOPAC. MOPAC input ﬁle is directly prepared by
Pybel and OpenBabel. The detailed introductions for all descrip—
tors are provided in the ChemoPy manual (see Supplementary
Material S3). A user guide for the use of ChemoPy is included to
guide how the user uses it to calculate the needed features (see
Supplementary Material S4).

ChemoPy is written by the pure python language. We chose
to use python because it is open source, and there already exist
packages to handle small molecules [e.g. Pybel (O’Boyle et al.,
2008b), PyMol and Cinfony (O’Boyle et al., 2008a)]. It is con—
venient for ChemoPy to analyse drug molecules processed
by Cinfony or RDKit. ChemoPy is available for two operating
systems: Linux and Windows. ChemoPy depends on Pybel,
RDKit, OpenBabel (O’Boyle et al., 2011) and MOPAC
(Stewart, 1990). Moreover, it needs the support of scientiﬁc
library for python (SciPy).

3 DISCUSSION

ChemoPy contains a selection of molecular descriptors to
analyse, classify and compare complex molecular network.
They facilitate to exploit machine—learning techniques to drive
hypothesis from complex molecular datasets. The usefulness of
these molecular descriptors covered by ChemoPy for represent—
ing structural features of small molecules has been sufﬁ—
ciently demonstrated by a number of published studies of the
development of machine—learning classiﬁcation systems. The
ChemoPy implementation of each of these algorithms was
extensively tested by using a number of test molecules. The com—
puted descriptor values were compared with the known
values for these molecules to ensure that our computation is
accurate.

Owing to the modular structure of ChemoPy, extensions or
new functionalities can be implemented easily without complex
and time—consuming alterations of the source code. In future
work, we plan to apply the integrated features on various biolo—
gical research questions, and extending the range of functions
with new promising descriptors for the coming versions of
ChemoPy.

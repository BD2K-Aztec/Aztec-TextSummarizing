Abstract

Motivation: The SEABED web server integrates a variety of docking and OSAR techniques in a
user—friendly environment. SEABED goes beyond the basic docking and OSAR web tools and im—
plements extended functionalities like receptor preparation, library editing, flexible ensemble dock—
ing, hybrid docking/OSAR experiments or virtual screening on protein mutants. SEABED is not a
monolithic workflow tool but Software as a Service platform.

Availability and implementation: SEABED is a free web server available at http://www.bsc.es/

 

SEABED. No registration is required.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

 

1 Introduction

In silico methods such as molecular docking and quantitative-activ-
ity relationship (QSAR) are gaining an increased role in drug discov-
ery (Alvarez, 2004; Bajorath, 2002). QSAR approaches are
predictive models trained to distinguish compounds from molecular
descriptors. Molecular docking tries to recover active ligands by
finding the best possible fitting of compounds to a 3D-binding site.
QSAR is faster and often more robust than docking approaches, but
is limited to suggesting molecules close to those of proven activity.
Docking requires knowledge of the structure of biological target, is
computationally very demanding, and is less robust than QSAR, but
can make suggestions for new drug scaffolds. We are then looking at
two complementary techniques, and it is not a surprise that during
daily practice drug designers are continuously using both
approaches, which is largely facilitated by commercial programs,
and a non-negligible list of open source software and web services
(Coleman et (11., 2013; Grosdidier et [11. 2011; O’Boyle er [1]., 2011;
Tetko er [1]., 2005; Trott and Olson, 2010). SEABED is a web server

that automates different tools for virtual screening. This includes
classical QSAR (with a large variety of machine learning tools) or
molecular docking (with many features for target and ligand-
binding characterization). The server allows a unique integration of
molecular dynamics information in flexible (ensemble) docking
(Carlson, 2002; Chaudhuri er [1]., 2012; Rueda er [1]., 2009) enriched
with essential dynamics MD (EDMD) sampling (Carrillo er [1].,
2012). It also enables us to combine in a single project docking and
QSAR (following the ideas in Yoon er [1]., 2005), and to incorporate
genetic variability into the docking process. The modular nature of
SEABED (see Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Data)
allows an easy extension to incorporate additional modules.
Users can automate docking, QSAR, structure-ensemble docking,
hybrid docking/QSAR and docking of protein mutants
(Supplementary Table S1 provides an estimated processing time for
each feature). The server is complemented with other functionalities
to prepare the receptor and the compound libraries. Receptor and
compounds can be uploaded by the user or extracted from public
databases.

a new subset on the workspace. The expected results (AUC and
ROC curves) of this test are available on Supplementary Data.

Ensemble docking adds a few steps to the workflow, as the user
needs to upload a MD trajectory and choose a number of represen—
tative snapshots to be used in docking (Fig. 1g—i and full description
at (http://www.bsc.es/SEABED/static/EnsembleDocking.html). To
run Ensemble docking, select ‘New Docking” from the bottom menu
and select ‘Molecular Dynamics” on the Select target panel.
SEABED will expect two files: topology (Reference file) and coord—
inates (Trajectory file). Then we will choose the number of represen—
tative snapshots (up to 10) based on K—means clustering and RMSd
score of atoms from pocket. The expected results (Fig. 1j) are also
available on Supplementary Data. As reported in a previous work
(Chaudhuri et (11., 2012) for 1A9U, MD ensemble can significantly
improve AUC score, from 0.64 for rigid docking to 0.75 for ensem—
ble docking.

The last workflow of this example explains how to use SEABED
to run docking on known mutants of this protein. Users will need to
search and model mutants by following the workflow steps on
Figure 1k—m. A full description is available at http://www.bsc.es/
SEABED/static/MutantDocking.html). SEABED is able to identify
two mutants from MK14 found in 1000 Genomes database (P6A
and D343G). From the ‘Structures’ panel go to 1a9u and select
‘Info”. Then select ‘Mutation Information” from the drop down
menu. Then select ‘Model the mutation” and the two new structures
will be available on the ‘Structures” main panel. Then run a rigid
docking workflow. Docking these mutants using the same dataset
(see expected results on Supplementary Data) we do not see big dif—
ferences compared with the wild type. Thus, the performance of the
mutants does not differ significantly. For a more detailed description
of this example see Supplementary Data and SEABED online
Tutorial and Getting Started sections.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Hormone pathway interactions are crucial in shaping
plant development, such as synergism between the auxin and
brassinosteroid pathways in cell elongation. Both hormone pathways
have been characterized in detail, revealing several feedback loops.
The complexity of this network, combined with a shortage of kinetic
data, renders its quantitative analysis virtually impossible at present.
Results: As a first step towards overcoming these obstacles, we
analyzed the network using a Boolean logic approach to build
models of auxin and brassinosteroid signaling, and their interaction.
To compare these discrete dynamic models across conditions, we
transformed them into qualitative continuous systems, which predict
network component states more accurately and can accommodate
kinetic data as they become available. To this end, we developed
an extension for the SQUAD software, allowing semi-quantitative
analysis of network states. Contrasting the developmental output
depending on cell type-specific modulators enabled us to identify a
most parsimonious model, which explains initially paradoxical mutant
phenotypes and revealed a novel physiological feature.

1 INTRODUCTION

The ontogenesis of plants is characterized by an intrinsic
developmental plasticity, which reﬂects their capacity to adapt to
environmental conditions and is frequently conveyed by modulation
of plant hormone pathways (Nemhauser et al., 2006). Thus,
plant hormones are not only essential for various endogenous
developmental programs, but also for the perception of, and
adaptation to, environmental change. Several plant hormone
pathways are known, and their often context-speciﬁc, overlapping
activities suggest that they inﬂuence each other, sometimes

in a hierarchical, sometimes in a synergistic manner. Auxin
and brassinosteroids are among the best characterized hormones
with well-deﬁned signaling pathways and cellular effects. Both
hormones are limiting for cell elongation, a process in which they
act synergistically because of crosstalk between their pathways
(Hardtke, 2007; Kuppusamy et al., 2008).

A distinct feature that sets auxin apart from other plant hormones
is the fact that it can be moved through the plant body by specialized
molecular machinery. This regulated and directional transport, called
polar auxin transport (PAT), contributes signiﬁcantly to the local
control of auxin action (Leyser, 2005). Although other hormones,
including brassinosteroids (Savaldi-Goldstein et al., 2007), might
well be mobile within a certain range from their site of production,
specialized transport systems apart from PAT have not been found so
far. Together with auxin biosynthesis, PAT determines cellular auxin
concentration, which is translated into a transcriptional response
via the canonical auxin signaling pathway. This involves nuclear
auxin receptors, transport inhibitor response 1 (TIRl) and homologs,
a class of SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase F—box proteins that are
activated by binding auxin, hence targeting transcriptional co-
repressors of the auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (AUX/1AA) family
for proteasome-mediated degradation (Dharmasiri et al., 2005;
Kepinski and Leyser, 2005). Since AUX/IAAs inhibit the activation
potential of auxin response factors (ARFs), this releases ARFs to
activate transcriptional targets of auxin signaling through auxin-
responsive promoter elements (AuxREs) (Benjamins and Scheres,
2008).

Importantly, auxin signaling involves a negative feedback loop, as
AUX/1AA genes are among the most prominent, early auxin signaling
targets. Moreover, auxin signaling also affects PAT, because it
controls the expression of several of the integral plasma membrane
auxin efﬂux carriers, the PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins (Sauer et al.,
2006; Vieten et al., 2005; Wisniewska et al., 2006). Therefore, auxin
transport and signaling are intimately linked, and local auxin activity
is conveyed by their interplay (Benjamins and Scheres, 2008; Leyser,
2005).

The brassinosteroid pathway represents a more classic
signaling paradigm, where perception of the hormone at the
plasma membrane modulates the activity of nuclear targets to
eventually trigger gene expression changes (Kim et (11., 2009;
Vert et al., 2005). Brassinosteroids are perceived by integral

Cellular auxin and brassinosteroid signaling

 

plasma membrane proteins with a leucine-rich repeat receptor-
like kinase topology, the brassinosteroid insensitive l (BRIl)
and BRIl-like proteins. Binding of brassinosteroid promotes
association of the receptors with another membrane-bound
kinase, BRIl-associated receptor kinase 1, triggering a series
of phosphorylation events. This signaling cascade, via several
intermediates, inhibits the activity of BRASSINOSTEROID-
INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2), a glycogen synthase kinase 3/shaggy-like
kinase. In the absence of brassinosteroid, BIN2 phosphorylates the
highly homologous transcription factors bril-EMS-SUPPRESSOR
l (BESl) and BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT l (BZRl). Thus,
upon brassinosteroid signaling, aided by the phosphatase bril-
SUPPRESSOR l (BSUl), BESl and BZRl accumulate in a
dephosphorylated state, which results in altered nucleo-cytoplasmic
partitioning and DNA binding afﬁnity towards brassinosteroid-
responsive promoter elements (BRREs), and thus target gene
activation. This signaling pathway involves a homeostatic feedback
loop, since it directly impinges on brassinosteroid biosynthesis.

The pathways described above appear to be universally
expressed throughout the plant, and have been implicated in
many developmental or physiological processes. This is somewhat
paradoxical, given that many of these processes do not appear
to be related. However, while less variability has been observed
in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway, (tissue-)speciﬁcity of
auxin effects could be explained by the complexity of the auxin
signaling components, notably the numerous AUX/1AA and ARF
genes. The respective proteins are likely not fully redundant, thus
their differential expression could introduce a cell type-speciﬁcity
to auxin response (Weijers et (11., 2005). Moreover, the ARF
proteins do not only encompass transcriptional activators, but also
transcriptional repressors. Another explanation could be that auxin,
and brassinosteroid, action depends in part on molecular pre-patterns
that could involve context-speciﬁc modulators and read-outs of
auxin action (Badescu and Napier, 2006; Benjamins and Scheres,
2008; Braun et (11., 2008; Strader et (11., 2008; Tromas et (11.,
2009). One such modulator could be the BREVIS RADIX (BRX)
gene, which is speciﬁcally expressed in the vasculature and is rate-
limiting for auxin action, likely by impinging on brassinosteroid
biosynthesis (Beuchat et (11., 2010; Mouchel et (11., 2006). As BRX
activity is controlled by auxin at both the transcriptional and post-
translational level (Scacchi et (11., 2009), this suggests that BRX
mediates crosstalk between the two hormone pathways, adding to
accumulating evidence for a rate-limiting role of the brassinosteroid
pathway in auxin response (Hardtke, 2007; Kuppusamy et (11 ., 2008;
Nemhauser et (11., 2004; Vert et (11., 2008). Another factor involved
in auxin—brassinosteroid crosstalk is the repressive auxin response
factor, ARF2, which has been shown to be a substrate of the BIN2
kinase (Vert et (11., 2008) and thus a direct point of crosstalk between
the two hormones.

Despite the detailed knowledge about the composition of the
signaling pathways, their discrete output in a given context still
remains largely obscure due to the quantitative nature of hormone
signaling and the technical difﬁculty in measuring it. The best
existing read-outs so far are (artiﬁcial) reporter genes, which
allow some generic quantiﬁcation of hormone pathway activity by
response to endogenous transcription factors (Muller and Sheen,
2008; Sabatini et (11., 1999). However, because of the multiple
feedback loops in each pathway and a lack of quantitative data on
the activity of individual components, e.g. the level and stability

of transcripts and proteins, steady state signaling amplitude in a
given condition and its developmental consequences are still nearly
impossible to predict.

In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we sought to
apply network modeling, which has proven useful in deciphering,
sometimes paradoxical, experimental observations in Arabidopsis
(e.g. Digiuni et (11., 2008; Liu et (11., 2010; Locke et (11., 2006).
We applied a Boolean logic approach (e.g. Pandey et (11., 2010) to
assess and analyze the auxin and brassinosteroid signaling networks,
and their interaction. To compare the behavior of the network
components across one or several conditions, we transformed a
discrete dynamic model into a qualitative continuous system using
the SQUAD software (Di Cara et (11., 2007). This approach has been
successfully applied previously to model gene regulatory networks
(Philippi et (11., 2009; Sanchez-Corrales et (11 ., 2010). A comparison
to alternative strategies ...(e.g., Diaz and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009) can
be found in (Wittmann et (11., 2009). Our model was able to explain
various paradoxical experimental observations, thereby helping us
to correctly place the BRX gene in the respective network and
approximate how the cell type-speciﬁc expression of BRX could
contribute to differential cell fate.

2 METHODS
2.1 Plant growth, genotyping and hormone
measurements

The Arabidopsis brx-Z and ary‘2-8 null mutants used to create the double
mutant have been described (Scacchi et (11., 2009; Vert at (11., 2008).
Plant tissue culture, genotyping and auxin measurements were performed
according to standard methods as described (Beuchat, at (11., 2010; Sibout,
at (11., 2006).

2.2 Signaling network representation

To reconstruct the auxin and brassinosteroid pathways, literature information
was used to assemble the signaling circuits with respect to the logical
formalism and signaling network framework. As described (Klarnt et (11.,
2006), signaling network models are structured by input, intermediate and
output layers. The input represents the starting points of a signaling circuit,
which formally are nodes without incoming arrows. Inversely, output nodes
are circuit end points that can depict developmental or physiological output
processes (Hyduke and Palsson, 2010). Together, the input and output layers
deﬁne the boundaries for the intermediate layer, which represents the core
signal transduction cascade. Due to their linear nature, signaling networks
are prone to node reduction, which permits to decrease the complexity of
the discrete analysis and avoid any delay issue during the analysis of the
continuous form (Naldi et (11., 2010). The network models were implemented
using cellDesigner v4.0.1 (www.celldesigner.org). The model descriptions
are available in XML format in the Supplementary Material.

2.3 Logical model simulation

Model simulations were performed using SQUAD V2.0 (Di Cara et (11.,
2007), which relies on a standardized qualitative dynamical systems
method (Mendoza and Xenarios, 2006) to provide an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) to each model component (Equation 1). This leads to the
transformation of the original discrete step function into a sigmoid response
curve. Each node’s ODE relies on two parameters: the gain of the sigmoid,
h, and the decay gi. In the absence of kinetic data, in this study we used the
default values of h: 10 and gi: l.

2.4 SQUAD add-on

An add-on to SQUAD developed for this study is provided as an R
package named SQUADD (SQUad ADD-on) in the Supplementary Material.
This add-on permits the generation of simulation matrices and prediction
heat maps. Simulation matrices are useful to assess the individual node
simulation proﬁles across several conditions (e. g. Supplementary Figure Sl),
whereas prediction heat maps are useful to analyze the node activation
change between, e.g. a perturbed condition and a ‘wild-type’ condition (e. g.
Fig. 5). The method takes the SQUAD simulation datasets as an input and
interpolates the data points with a locally weighted smoothing line or least
square ﬁtting line. At a user-deﬁned time value, the ratio of the interpolate
values between two conditions can then be calculated. Finally, the color
scale is deﬁned according to the ratio range. In this study, we applied a
lowess interpolation at t=50. The SQUADD software including a tutorial
can be downloaded as a Bioconductor package at http://www.bioconductor
.org/help/bioc-Views/release/bioc/html/SQUADD.html.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Modeling the core of cellular auxin perception

The goal of our study was to develop a cellular model for auxin—
brassinosteroid interaction in cell elongation. Roots grow at their
tips, where an apical meristem that harbors stem cells continuously
produces new cells that undergo a stage of proliferation, followed
by elongation and eventually differentiation (Osmont et a1., 2007).
Both auxin and brassinosteroids are limiting in this process. To build
up our core models of the auxin and brassinosteroid pathways,
we relied on solid, well-established experimental data from the
literature as summarized in recent reviews (Benjamins and Scheres,
2008; Hardtke, 2007; Kieffer et a1., 2010; Kim and Wang, 2010;
Scheres and Xu, 2006; Vert et a1., 2005). An overview of these
regulatory interactions can be found in Supplementary Table S1.
We started by creating a model of the core auxin signaling loops,
which includes the AUX/1AA transcriptional repressors, the TIRl-
type auxin receptors and the ARF transcriptional activators. As a
generic developmental read-out of the model we deﬁned auxin-
responsive elements and thus genes that are controlled by ARF
activity, including AUX/1AA genes as well as PIN genes. Finally,
auxin itself was added as a continuous stimulus in the model, based
on the observation that shoot-derived auxin is transported towards
the root tip from cell to cell via PAT during seedling development.
Evacuation of auxin from the cell by PIN proteins was integrated
into the model as a negative effect of PINs on cellular auxin activity.

3.1.] Modeling strategy Due to the absence of quantitative data
for most of the signaling components and the inherent difﬁculty
to obtain such, ideally kinetic data at spatio-temporal resolution
in a developmental context, we analyzed the signaling network
by a Boolean formalism approach (i.e. a logical model). In a
Boolean formalism, each node (i.e. model component) is deﬁned
by a variable x, which represents its state of activation (x=l)
or inactivation (x=0). The state of each node depends on its
interaction or regulatory relationship with other nodes. By extension,
the activation state of the system (i.e. of the totality of nodes) is given
by the vector of size n (n = number of nodes) of the node activation
states. Starting from given initial conditions and in response to a
stimulus (in our models auxin and/or brassinosteroids), this vector
is then updated synchronously or asynchronously, until the system
reaches a stable, or oscillating (complex) steady state.

Boolean formalism is powerﬁil but not very intuitive as the
range of values is discrete and kinetics are not considered, i.e. the
time scale is arbitrary. Components can be updated synchronously
or asynchronously, however synchronous update of the vector is
most of the time unrealistic, because it would assume that the
components are activated or inhibited simultaneously. This is not
the case in biological systems, where components are activated or
inhibited on different time scales that depend on the kinetics of
individual interactions (e.g. afﬁnity in protein—protein interactions)
or the speed of the activation/inhibition process (e.g. transcription
versus translation or protein degradation). To overcome the lack of
time scales in the Boolean approach, computational tools have been
developed, such as the SQUAD software, in which vector updates
are entirely asynchronous (Di Cara et a1., 2007). For example, in
a given sequence of A activates B activates C, a change of state
in A only triggers a change of state in B with a certain delay. A
change of state in C will then again only follow with a delay after
the state of change in B. Moreover, SQUAD permits assessment of
the behavior of components across an arbitrary time scale. This is
because SQUAD transforms a classic dynamic Boolean model into
a continuous one by using ordinary differential equations, one for
each node, given by the following equation:

dxl. _e0.5h + e—h(w,)

E = (1_e0.5h)(1+e—h(w,—0.5)) ‘gixi

With this equation, intermediate values between 0 and l and
therefore sigmoid curves can be obtained, which are useﬁil to assess
the behavior of components. The h parameter accounts for the
sigmoid gain, i.e. it controls the steepness of the curve (high values
will give curves close to a step function). gi represents the decay of
the node. wi is the continuous form of the truth table of each node,
i.e. the combinatorial effect of all the inputs into a given node. Due
to lack of kinetic information, the computations in our models were
performed with the default values of h = 10 and gi = 1. It is important
to note however, that kinetic data that should eventually become
available could be easily integrated into our models by setting h and
gi parameters accordingly, allowing model reﬁning. The logic rules
and equations describing the nodes of all models presented in this
study can be found in the Supplementary Material.

3.1.2 Behavior of the core SCFTirI-AUX/IAA-ARF auxin
perception module Based on the experimental data and strategy
outlined above, we created a model for the core auxin perception
machinery (Fig. 1A), which can be handled like a circuit. A signal
is injected into the system via an input node and its route can be
followed through the OR/AND gates and the node state switches
until it is caught by the terminal output node. The biological signal
for our model is auxin, which was thus set as the initial stimulus.
This auxin stimulation node represents the events of both passive
and active auxin inﬂux. As the ultimate output of the model, we
deﬁned a generic ‘elongation growth’ node, which represents the
developmental output of altered auxin-responsive gene expression
on cell elongation. Finally, the tendency of the activation pattern of
each node can be represented by a linear regression, which permits
a numerical estimation of node behavior (see below).

The SQUAD analysis indicates that the network components
exhibit oscillatory behavior (Fig. 1B), including the elongation
output, which is revealed by the sigmoid feature of the program. This
result is consistent with the idea of inherent buffering in signaling

networks, which prevents a signaling lock-in as well as exaggerated
response to transient stimulus and thus provides developmental
ﬂexibility. As SCFTIRl is activated by auxin, Aux/IAAs are
inhibited, allowing ARFs to reach their maximum activity, while
decreasing SCFTIRl activity stabilizes Aux/IAAs and thus inhibits
ARFs. Importantly, to avoid a lock-in steady state of the network,
negative feedback on auxin through PAT is required, which is
mediated by the positive effect of auxin perception on PIN activity.
In summary, the model correctly simulates the behavior of the core
components in auxin perception. Due to the solid experimental
evidence for the functioning of the auxin perception machinery,
we considered the behavior of its components as a control in the
analyses of subsequent, more complex models.

3.2 Modeling of brassinosteroid signaling and its
interaction with auxin signaling

In the next step, we sought to extend our model by integrating
the brassinosteroid signaling pathway and thus account for the
observed synergism between the two hormone pathways (Hardtke,
2007; Kuppusamy et a1., 2008; Mouchel et a1., 2006; Nemhauser
et a1., 2004). First, similar to the auxin model, we built a model
of brassinosteroid signaling based on experimental data from the

literature (Kim et a1., 2009; Kim and Wang, 2010; Vert et a1.,
2005) (Fig. 1C). Beyond the signal transduction from BRIl to the
BESl/BZRl transcription factors and the eventual modulation of
brassinosteroid-responsive gene expression, we also included an
explicit feedback on brassinosteroid biosynthesis. This feedback is
not only an important component of brassinosteroid homeostasis,
but also the major dampening factor of the signaling pathway,
conceptually similar to AUX/IAA feedback on auxin signaling. In
response to a brassinosteroid stimulus, this model again swiftly
reaches a quasi-steady state, including an oscillating developmental
output (Fig. 1D). Thus, both of our models appear to correctly
capture the signaling features described in the literature.

3.2.1 Alain—brassinosteroid interaction—the ARF2 connection
To integrate the two models, auxin- and brassinosteroid-responsive
gene expression was linked to a common developmental output
node, reﬂecting the observed synergism of the two hormones in
controlling cell elongation (Hardtke, 2007; Nemhauser et a1., 2004;
Wang et a1., 2005). Thus, in the integrated model, the developmental
output reports the impact of both auxin- and brassinosteroid-
responsive promoter elements, which are indeed frequently found
together in genes that respond to both hormones.

Beyond the common occurrence of auxin- and brassinosteroid-
responsive elements in promoters, only few components that
might mediate more direct, non-genomic auxin—brassinosteroid
interaction have been described, such as the inhibitory ARF2. ARF2
activity is directly modulated through the BIN2 kinase, which
can phosphorylate ARF2 to prevent it from DNA binding (Vert
et a1., 2008). Thereby brassinosteroids would activate an inhibitory
component of auxin signaling, since all ARFs can bind to the
same auxin-responsive promoter elements (Guilfoyle and Hagen,
2007). Moreover, a signiﬁcant effect of ARF2 on genes involved in
auxin biosynthesis has been reported, suggesting that brassinosteroid
might modulate auxin biosynthesis (Vert et a1., 2008). However, the
contribution of cellular auxin biosynthesis to our model is negligible
for the developmental output as long as auxin ﬂow through the cell
is maintained by PAT, which is consistent with established models
and experimental ﬁndings (Grieneisen et a1., 2007). Based on these
reported results, we placed ARF2 as a central node connecting auxin
and brassinosteroid signaling in our model (Fig. 2A). Moreover,
we also integrated ARF2 into the auxin signaling pathway, because
inhibitory ARFs, just like activating ones, do interact with AUX/IAA
proteins, although at seemingly lower afﬁnity (Tiwari et a1., 2003).

The exact role of inhibitory ARFs (ARFi) is not clear, and it has
been suggested that they could act by competing with activating
ARFs (ARFa) for binding sites, or by directly inhibiting them upon
dimerization (Guilfoyle and Hagen, 2007). For our logical model,
this is directly not relevant as either mode of interaction impinges
on kinetic parameters, but not the logic. In our model, we placed
ARF2 under AUX/IAA control, such that AUX/IAA degradation in
response to auxin stimulus would remove one level of inhibition
from ARFi. Notably, however, in our logical model the exact mode
of ARF2 inhibition does not matter for the working of the auxin core
perception module, i.e. the quasi-steady state behavior is similar,
although the (unknown) signaling amplitude might differ with or
without ARFi. For the integrated model, again an oscillating quasi-
steady state developmental output was observed, however with a
slightly more restricted amplitude (Fig. 2B).

3.2.2 Auxin—brassinosteroid interaction—integration of BRX A
subject of special interest to us was to integrate the BRX gene
into our model, since its position with respect to auxin and
brassinosteroid signaling remains obscure despite the experimental
evidence collected so far (see above). In particular, we aimed to
evaluate a suspected role of BRX in an accessory auxin signaling
pathway, which could serve to modulate auxin-response in a
context-dependent manner (Scacchi et al., 2009).

To place BRX in our model, we ﬁrst considered the regulatory
inﬂuence of auxin on BRX activity. The BRX promoter contains
prototypical AuxREs, and consistently, BRX expression is highly
auxin-inducible, presumably through the canonical auxin signaling

core (Mouchel et a1., 2006; Scacchi et a1., 2009). At the same time,
auxin has a more direct effect on BRX protein, by promoting its
transfer into the nucleus, where it presumably regulates transcription
in conjunction with NGATHA (NGA) B3-type transcription factors
(Scacchi et a1., 2009). Thus, we placed BRX directly under auxin
control. This regulation was considered as activating, although the
nuclear transfer of BRX eventually results in BRX degradation
(Scacchi et a1., 2009). The latter would only restrict the duration of
nuclear BRX activity, however, which can be neglected in a logical
model.

The positive regulation of BRX by auxin, both at the
transcriptional and post-translational level, would not inﬂuence
the developmental output unless BRX activity feeds back into
the network. This feedback is assumed to pass through the
brassinosteroid pathway, possibly by promoting brassinosteroid
biosynthesis, since brx phenotypes can be largely rescued by
brassinosteroid application (Mouchel et a1., 2006), and since gain-
of—ﬁmction lines constitutively and ectopically over-expressing
full length BRX or a stabilized, partially active C-terminal
fragment contained signiﬁcantly higher levels of the major
active brassinosteroids, brassinolide and its precursor, castasterone
(Beuchat et a1., 2010). Therefore, a positive inﬂuence of BRX on
brassinosteroid biosynthesis was included in our model (Fig. 4A).

Finally, we also included the interaction of activated (nuclear
localized) BRX with NGA transcription factors into our model,
since the latter have been proposed to positively regulate auxin
biosynthesis (Trigueros, et a1., 2009). Whether BRX has an
inhibitory or an activating inﬂuence on NGA remains to be
experimentally determined. However, for our model this was not
relevant, because as stated above, as long as auxin is provided by
PAT, cellular auxin biosynthesis is negligible for the developmental
output.

Different variants of the full model (i.e. including ARF2, BRX
and NGAl) were created (Fig. 4A; Table 1) to account for the
unknowns described above, such as the regulatory relation between
BRX and NGAl. Moreover, we also created variants that assumed
a potential direct inﬂuence of BRX on auxin-responsive gene
expression (Scacchi et a1., 2009). Only variants with a valid (i.e.
steady state) developmental output were retained for ﬁirther analysis
(variants 4.1.1, 4.2.1, 5.1.1 and 5.2.1; Table 1) (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Developmental output that could not reach a steady state
any longer and ﬂuctuated in a stochastic manner was observed if
the positive link between BRX and brassinosteroid biosynthesis was
removed, reinforcing its signiﬁcance.

3.3 Behavior and testing of the integrated models

Similar to the previous model, the extended versions produced an
oscillating quasi-steady state developmental output in most variants
(Fig. 4B). This output displayed different trajectories however,
consistent with the idea that accessory factors can introduce
differential cell fate (Fig. 4B). We would like to note that the cyclic
attractors (i.e. oscillating steady states) are consistent with various
experimentally observed feedbacks, for instance the transcriptional
re-activation of AUX/IAAs in response to their auxin-mediated
degradation and the associated oscillation of auxin response.
Whether other component states predicted to oscillate by our models
in fact do so, for instance hormone levels, is not known and
experimentally challenging to determine. Dynamic reporters that can

be followed by live imaging at high temporal and cellular resolution
would be required for this purpose. We would like to highlight
however that modiﬁed logical rules can be found to eliminate cyclic
attractors in our model if justiﬁed, and that our model describes
an abstracted signaling network rather than, for instance, a gene
regulatory network. Even if the steady states emerging from our
models are oscillatory, they clearly describe the difference between
the perturbated conditions.

In the next step, we aimed to test whether the models accurately
reﬂect observed experimental ﬁndings. First, we perturbed the
models by removing BRX a short time after stimulation (Fig. 4C).
This resulted in dramatically altered developmental output, which
even reached a linear steady state close to inactivity as compared
to the ﬁill model in two variants (5.1.1 and 5.2.1). By contrast,
removing ARF2 from the model did not have any major effect
on the developmental output. Both results match with the severity
of the root growth phenotypes of the respective mutants, i.e.
the strong short root phenotype of brx versus absence of a
morphological root phenotype in aer (Mouchel et al., 2004; Vert
et al., 2008).

Finally, we tested whether the developmental output of our model
could be rescued by a brassinosteroid stimulus after a loss of
BRX function, simulating the phenotypic rescue of brx mutants
by brassinosteroid application (Mouchel et al., 2006). This was
indeed the case, i.e. adding brassinosteroid stimulus to the model
after elimination of BRX activity and subsequent breakdown of

developmental output swiftly restored the output to a pattern that
was largely similar to the unperturbed model (Fig. 4D). Interestingly,
this was only possible if BRX was not positioned within the
brassinosteroid signal transduction module.

3.3.] Testing the model - genetic interaction between ARF2 and
BRX Experimental support for the notion that BRX does not ﬁt into
the brassinosteroid signaling chain was obtained from the analysis
of aer brx double mutants. Previously, it was found that the long
hypocotyl 5 (hy5) mutation signiﬁcantly suppresses the brx root
growth phenotype in brx hy5 double mutants (Scacchi et al., 2009).
Supposedly, this is due to constitutively increased auxin-responsive
transcription as conferred by hy5 loss of function (Sibout et al.,
2006), which can in turn offset diminished auxin-responsiveness in
brx mutants to some degree. Along these lines, it was speculated
that quantitatively impaired auxin-response in brx mutants might
be compensated by aer mutation. To test this hypothesis, we
generated an an? brx double mutant from respective null alleles.
Assessment of the root growth phenotype of this double mutant
revealed that it was not signiﬁcantly different from the brx control
line (Fig. 3A). Thus, the aer mutation cannot suppress the effect
of brx, which is consistent with perturbation of our models, i.e. the
developmental output after removal of BRX and ARF2 activity from
the model was identical to the output observed after BRX removal
only (Fig. 4E). This ﬁnding, together with the brassinosteroid rescue
of brx phenotypes, would also suggest that the main point of auxin—
brassinosteroid synergism at the transcriptional level are genes that
are activated by both AuxREs and BRREs in their promoters.

3.3.2 Semi-quantitative presentation of perturbation consequences
by predictive heat maps In the next step, we aimed to determine
which of the integrated models best accommodate additional
experimental data. To facilitate this task, we generated predictive
heat maps to assess the activity state change of components between
a perturbation and the normal condition. As SQUAD uses an
exponential interpolation of Boolean states to obtain continuous
activation values, and since activation states do not really represent
quantitative experimental data, an absolute quantitative prediction
of component activities is not possible. However, a relative, semi-
quantitative analysis can be performed to reﬂect a qualitative change

in behavior of components between any two conditions. For such an
evaluation, we implemented an R-based script to generate predictive
heat maps using a simple algorithm (see Supplementary Material,
SQUAD add-on R package). This tool takes the SQUAD simulation
datasets as an input and interpolates the various data points for
components with a locally weighted smoothing line at a user-deﬁned
time value. To compare two model variants, it then calculates the
ratio of the interpolated values for a given component between a
perturbation and the normal condition. Integrated across the time
scale, this then indicates a relative change in the activity status of
a node, i.e. an overall increase or decrease in activity. Finally, this
relative change is then presented in a color scale grid, permitting

intuitive assessment of the consequences of model perturbations and
variations (Fig. 5).

Starting from our set of model variants, we generated predictive
heat maps to compare the relative node states for the perturbations
described above. We then determined for which variant model the
experimental observations in the brx mutant ﬁt best, focusing on
two key results: (i) the observation that the expression of an AuxRE
reporter gene is reduced in brx roots (Mouchel et al., 2006); (ii)
the observation that brx roots mimic wild-type roots treated with
auxin transport inhibitors (Scacchi et al., 2009), consistent with a
downregulation of certain PIN genes in brx (Mouchel et al., 2006);
Only models 5.1.1 and 5.2.1 matched these observations.

Fig. 5. Semi-quantitative evaluation of model output by predictive heat
maps. (A7D) Predictive heat maps of relative changes of node activities in
the model variants and perturbations as described in Figure 4, in comparison
to the respective unperturbed models.

The principal difference between these two models is in the
regulatory relationship between BRX and NGAl, which is reﬂected
in a predicted decrease (5.1.1) or increase (5.2.1) in auxin
biosynthesis and thus free auxin levels upon BRX loss of function.
Surprisingly, direct measurement indicated that free auxin levels
are indeed signiﬁcantly increased in brx seedlings (Fig. 3B),
suggesting that model 5.2.1 is most parsimonious with experimental
observations.

To further evaluate the robustness of our model, we also ran it in
Boolean, synchronous mode using the GinSim software (Gonzalez
et al., 2006), which conﬁrmed the cyclic attractors observed in the
continuous form (see Supplementary Material). Finally, we also
conducted a stability analysis by sampling a range of parameter
values and time points. This analysis corroborated earlier ﬁndings
about sensible parameter ranges (Mendoza and Pardo, 2010) and
revealed very little variation in the qualitative behavior of our model,
conﬁrming that it is robust (see heat maps in the Supplementary
Material).

3.4 Conclusions

In summary, we have built qualitative and continuous logical models
of auxin and brassinosteroid signaling, and their interaction. The
models account for well established as well as novel experimental
observations and demonstrate how a cell type-speciﬁc modulator,
BRX, could be integrated. Taking into account novel experimental
data also allowed us to choose between alternative models to
correctly place BRX in the network. This most parsimonious
model predicts an inhibition of NGAl by BRX and an accessory
role of BRX in auxin perception and signaling, guiding ﬁiture
experimentation. Notably, no valid developmental output was
observed when a direct or indirect (e.g. through NGAl), but ARF-
independent impact of BRX on AuxREs was assumed. The recent
experimental conﬁrmation that BRX can interact directly with ARFs
was in fact motivated by this prediction (Scacchi et al., 2010).
Finally, our models can serve as a basis for the work of others and,
thanks to the SQUAD approach, can be extended for quantitative,
kinetic data as they become available.

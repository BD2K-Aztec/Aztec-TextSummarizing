ABSTRACT

Motivation: Several techniques analyze gene expression data from
the point of view of biological ontologies. These methods focus on
statistical and numerical analyses, but there is an additional need for
fast, global and interactive visualizations of gene expression data in
the context of biological ontologies.

Results: Voronto addresses these needs with an easy to use integra-
tion of custom gene expression data with custom or public ontologies.
In order to do that, it implements Voronoi diagrams where ontologies
are mapped with gene expression, providing a quick hierarchy brows-
ing and integration with ontology’s resources.

Availability: The tool is available at http://vis.usa|.es/voronto. Source

1 INTRODUCTION

Function and relation-focused techniques are gaining interest as
part of expression data analyses. The growing of existing biological
knowledge and its consolidation into structured ontologies
(Ashburner et al., 2000; Kanehisa, 2000; Matthews et al., 2009)
make it possible to integrate such information into the analysis
process. The results of these techniques are usually lists of
enriched terms, which focus on statistical signiﬁcance and other
numerical information, disregarding non-enriched terms, hier-
archical relationships and expression levels. It is therefore hard,
if not impossible, to get a picture of expression data in the context
of the whole ontology at hand, and to easily inspect it. Here, we
present Voronto, a tool that integrates expression data and biolo-
gical ontologies, allowing the analyst to explore the whole ontol-
ogy and detect changes on expression patterns inside the ontology.

2 APPROACH

Voronoi diagrams determine, for a set of points, the areas which
are closer to each point, dividing the plane into adjacent
polygons. If we consider each ontology term as a point, and
recursively apply the techique to hierarchy levels, we obtain

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

a treemap-like Voronoi Visualization of the hierarchy. This tech-
nique was originally described by Balzer et a]. (2005) and has
been adapted to taxonomies (Horn et al., 2009) and to ontologies
by Bernhardt et a]. (2009). However, Bernhard et al.’s adaptation
lacks the degree of interaction and immediacy to make it usable
for exploratory analysis. Also, it is not directly connected to
related ontology resources, which can be very helpful for detailed
investigation. Voronto takes these former approaches as the
basis to build a tool for exploration of both expression data
and hierarchical ontologies, and its integration with ontology
sources. We also take care on information Visualization and
Visual analysis concepts to make it a highly interactive, easy to
use, pattern discovery tool.

3 METHODS

Voronto uses a recursive algorithm similar to the one described by Balzer
et a]. Each step builds the tessellation for a hierarchy level. During each
step, several iterations are performed in order to adjust location and sizes
of the Voronoi cells to the ontology term sizes (i.e. number of annotated
genes) by means of an additiver weighted Voronoi tessellation [adapted
from Takashi Ohyama’s implementation (http://www.nirarebakun.com/
voro/epwvoro.html)]. Each iteration also optimize cell shapes through a
centroidal Voronoi tessellation approach (Lloyd’s method).

Voronto includes parsed, up to date versions of KEGG, GO and
Reactome ontologies, and mappings to annotated genes for most organ-
isms. It also accepts custom ontolgies in a simple xml format. Gene ex-
pression data must be provided by the user, in a tab matrix format,
including gene identiﬁers that match with the ontology identiﬁers for
annotated genes. Voronto then maps gene expression to the ontology
terms (the expression of a term corresponds to the average expression
of every annotated gene for the term that is present in the user’s expres-
sion data) and computes the tessellation.

The resulting visualization (Fig. 1) represents an ontology level, so
each term is represented by a polygon (cell) colored with its expression.
Terms with a common ancestor are represented by adjacent cells, and
surrounded by a wider line. The user can go up or down in the hierarchy
by using the up/down arrow keys. He can also browse the experimental
conditions by using the left/right keys. To avoid losing context, a proﬁle
with the hovered term’s expression level for each experimental condition
is also shown.

Term cells can be clicked for two effects. Double-click opens the avail-
able web resources (AmiGO entries, Reactome pathway graphs or
KEGG colored pathway images). Alt-click shows a heatmap with the
expression proﬁle of every gene in the term. Genes in the heatmap are
double-clickable to open their GenBank entry. Several other options,
such as term labeling, quantile expression scaling, gene or term searching,
ontology areas expansion, etc. are also available.

Fig. 1. KEGG orthology mapped with yeast expression along the cell cycle (data available at Voronto’s web page). (Left) Visualization of the third
hierarchy level for expression at 42’ (phase C2). The term ‘Sulfur metabolism’, with nine mapped genes, is highlighted, and its proﬁle bar for the whole time
series shown at the bottom. (Right, top and center) First and second levels of the hierarchy, ‘Sulfur metabolism’ belongs to ‘Metabolism’ and ‘Energy
metabolism’. (Right, bottom) Heatmap with ‘Sulfur metabolism’ annotatd genes, showing the overexpression at 42’ is mostly due to three of them.

4 DISCUSSION

The tool has been tested with several expression data, from dif-
ferent organisms and experimental contexts (see Supplementary
Information for some use cases). Biologist’s testing of the tool
suggests that it is useful on a top-down approach: start by the
highest levels of the ontology and narrow down the search to
differentially expressed lower terms, helped by the proﬁle bar
and the gene heatmap. It has also been used with success in
bottom-up approaches, starting with genes or terms known to
be relevant for the experiment and searching them in the ontol-
ogy to determine biological relations or expression patterns.

As an example, in Figure l we can easily identify ‘Sulfur me-
tabolism’ as highly expressed, and at the same time, we can check
other terms (e. g. ‘RNA transport’, with no signiﬁcant expression,
or “Peroxisome”, slightly underexpressed) or other time points
for ‘Sulfur metabolism’ (42/ is a peak around C2 phase, with no
signiﬁcant expression earlier or later on). From there we can go up
on the hierarchy to check for more generic behaviors or narrow
down to identify the genes involved in ‘Sulfur metabolism’.

5 CONCLUSION

Voronto unburdens the analyst from mapping ontologies to gene
expression and offers a clean, general View of the hierarchy. It
favors exploration in the context of the ontology’s resources
and the experimental conditions, complementing functional en-
richment analysis, common in systems biology studies. These

characteristics make Voronto a powerful, yet simple and fast,
way to study expression data in the context of ontologies.

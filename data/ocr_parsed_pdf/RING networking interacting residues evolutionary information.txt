ABSTRACT

Motivation: Residue interaction networks (Rle) have been used
in the literature to describe the protein 3D structure as a graph
where nodes represent residues and edges physico—chemical
interactions, e.g. hydrogen bonds or van-der-Waals contacts.
Topological network parameters can be calculated over Rle and
have been correlated with various aspects of protein structure
and function. Here we present a novel web server, RING, to
construct physico—chemically valid Rle interactively from PDB
files for subsequent visualization in the Cytoscape platform. The
additional structure-based parameters secondary structure, solvent
accessibility and experimental uncertainty can be combined with
information regarding residue conservation, mutual information and
residue-based energy scoring functions. Different visualization styles
are provided to facilitate visualization and standard plugins can be
used to calculate topological parameters in Cytoscape. A sample use
case analyzing the active site of glutathione peroxidase is presented.
Availability: The RING server, supplementary methods, examples
and tutorials are available for non-commercial use at URL:

1 INTRODUCTION

The last 15 years have seen the advent of network representation
to tackle the complexity inherent in many problems in biology.
By focusing on the network properties of a system it is often
possible to gain a new level of insight into apparently unpredictable
systems (Albert et (11., 2000; Barabasi and Albert, 1999). The most
studied example in biology is protein interaction networks, where
nodes represent proteins and connections between nodes (physical)
interactions. Tools have been developed to visualize and analyze
such networks, with Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) probably
being the most widely accepted stande platform due to its open
structure and extendibility. More recently, there has been a growing
interest in representing protein structures as so-called residue
interaction networks (RINs) (Csermely, 2008). RINs consider single
amino acids in the protein structure as nodes and connections
as physico—Chemical interactions, such as covalent bonds and
non-covalent contacts (e.g. hydrogen bonds). The intuitive idea
is to analyze a structure with the same approach as a protein

interaction network in order to investigate whether the same rules
apply. Several papers have already used RINs to analyze protein
stability and folding, allosteric communication, enzyme catalysis or
mutation effect prediction (Buslje et al., 2010; Del Sol et al., 2007;
Dokholyan et al., 2002; Soundararajan et al., 2010; Suel et al., 2003;
Swint-Kruse, 2004; Vendruscolo et al., 2001). A more complete
bibliography is available online.

Here, we present RING as a novel tool to generate RINs for use
in Cytoscape. The tool was conceived to yield a simple, intuitive
representation that is physico—Chemically meaningful and integrates
different types of structure-based information with evolutionary
information and energy scoring functions.

2 PROGRAM OVERVIEW

RING requires as input a valid PDB identiﬁer or user speciﬁed
PDB ﬁle and provides two user interfaces. A simple user interface
with meaningful default values for most parameters is intended
for the inexperienced user. A more complex interface where the
user can specify exactly how the RIN should be deﬁned is
also provided. Three alternative types of network deﬁnitions are
available, with Closest atoms as default. Interactions are deﬁned
distinguishing disulﬁdes, salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and aromatic
interactions from generic van-der-Waals contacts. Structural features
are generated for each node and include secondary structure, solvent
accessibility and experimental uncertainty for X-ray structures
(i.e. B factor and occupancy). Protein sequence conservation
and mutual information (Buslje et (11., 2009, 2010), determined
from PSI-BLAST proﬁles, and conformational energy preferences
determined with FRST and TAP score (Tosatto, 2005; Tosatto
and Battistutta, 2007) are to the best of our knowledge unique
features of RING. The protocol uses standard programs to derive
the data and is described on the website. The output consists in
an archive ﬁle containing all the necessary network deﬁnition ﬁles
for Cytoscape. Once generated, the RIN can be easily visualized in
Cytoscape. Visualization ﬁlters are provided in RING to highlight
different structural features through the Cytoscape VizMapper
feature. Topological network properties can be analyzed with readily
available plugins, e.g. NetworkAnalyzer (Assenov et al., 2008).
Online help pages are provided for the web server together with
an extensive documentation on the implemented ﬁle format and
tutorials.

A special feature of RING is to generate meaningful sub-
networks. It has been suggested that RIN complexity can be focused
on essential interactions by limiting analysis to buried residues

Fig. 1. Protein structure of human glutathione peroxidase 4 (PDB identiﬁer
2obi). The 3D structure is shown as cartoons (A) colored by secondary
structure. The active site is shown in balls and sticks and labeled. Lighter
labels are used for the catalytic tetrad. The corresponding RING residue
interaction network in Cytoscape is shown for positions with at least 80%
sequence conservation (B) with circles representing exposed and diamonds
buried residues. Nodes are colored by secondary structure. Edges are colored
according to interaction type and width proportional to mutual information.
Notice how the most highly connected nodes in the sub-network correspond
to the active site and its immediate surroundings. The top 10 most connected
nodes of the network are shown in inset (C).

(Soundararajan et al., 2010). RING allows the user to limit the
generated network to buried residues, conserved residues or both.
Intuitively, limiting RIN analysis to a network of conserved residues
will help to focus on the essential interactions for a protein active
site as shown in the following case study.

3 CASE STU DY

The glutathione peroxidase (GPx) enzymes are an evolutionarily
conserved family catalyzing the reduction of hydroperoxides to
alcohols and the concomitant oxidation of thiols to disulﬁdes (Toppo
et al., 2008). Long thought to ﬁinction by means of a catalytic
triad, a detailed structural analysis of sequence conservation has
recently suggested a fourth residue to be catalytically active which
was experimentally conﬁrmed (Tosatto et al., 2008).

Figure 1 shows the GPx structure and corresponding RING sub-
network of conserved residues. The GPx active site can be easily
identiﬁed as the nodes with the highest number of connections in
the RIN. The combination of evolutionary conservation and basic
network topology thus provides an easy way to replicate the work
that led to the recent characterization of the GPx active site (Tosatto
et al., 2008). Moreover, mutual information provided by RING can
serve to investigate cases of co-evolution between residues. An
online tutorial explains the necessary steps to reproduce the steps to
generate the RIN visualization. Several further example are available
as part of the online tutorial.

In summary, RING is a novel web tool for use with Cytoscape
designed for the visualization and analysis of protein structures in
terms of physico—chemical interactions, evolutionary information
and energetics while taking advantage of the powerful network
paradigm. We anticipate this novel combination to facilitate the
functional annotation of proteins.

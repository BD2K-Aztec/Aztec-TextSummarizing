ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput measurements of mRNA abundances
from microarrays involve several stages of preprocessing. At each
stage, a user has access to a large number of algorithms with
no universally agreed guidance on which of these to use. We
show that binary representations of gene expressions, retaining
only information on whether a gene is expressed or not, reduces
the variability in results caused by algorithmic choice, while also
improving the quality of inference drawn from microarray studies.
Results: Binary representation of transcriptome data has the
desirable property of reducing the variability introduced at the
preprocessing stages due to algorithmic choice. We compare the
effect of the choice of algorithms on different problems and suggest
that using binary representation of microarray data with Tanimoto
kernel for support vector machine reduces the effect of the choice
of algorithm and simultaneously improves the performance of
classification of phenotypes.

1 INTRODUCTION

A plethora of computational methods for the statistical analysis
of high-throughput gene expression measurements is available to
users interested in making inferences from transcriptomes. The
preprocessing stages involved in the analysis include background
correction, within and between-array normalizations, probe-speciﬁc
correction and summarization. After the raw data is processed it
is subject to sophisticated machine learning approaches such as
classiﬁcation, cluster analysis and the modelling of time-course
data by means of dynamical systems. The preprocessing stages lead
to quantiﬁcations of relative mRNA abundances, taking scanned
images as input. The choices made here have been shown to have
an important effect on the results of statistical inference approaches
(Allison et al., 2006; Barash et al., 2004; Choe et al., 2005;
Cope et (11., 2004; Millenaar et (11., 2006; Ploner et (11., 2005; Qin
et (11., 2006; Shedden et (11., 2005). We review the effect of the
choice of algorithms on different problems and suggest that using
binary representation of microarray data with Tanimoto kernel for
support vector machine (SVM) reduces the variability due to the

choice of algorithm and simultaneously improves the performance
of classiﬁcation on transcriptome data.

The most extensive study so far that shows signiﬁcant algorithmic
variability is due to RC. Boutrosl who analysed an impressive 19 446
different combinations of preprocessing algorithms, and quantiﬁed
the sensitivity and stability of expression levels. While this and
similar studies (Choe et (11., 2005) seek the best combination of
algorithms on a small number of datasets, they do not offer a generic
solution for practitioners to select a combination that leads to reliable
results in downstream inference.

Our approach, starting from the premise of seeking sensible
numerical precisions to represent microarray data, is similar to the
‘bar code’ method advanced by Zilliox and Irizarry (2007). In our
previous work (Tuna and Niranjan, 2010), we established that gene
expressions quantized to binary precision lead to minimal average
loss in the quality of inference drawn from them, in a range of
applications such as classiﬁcation, clustering and the analysis of
time-course data. Any loss of information due to binarization was
shown to be easily recovered using metrics of similarity between
gene expression proﬁles that are best suited for high-dimensional
binary spaces (Tuna and Niranjan, 2009). Our results showed
that the Tanimoto metric, successﬁilly used in matching chemical
ﬁngerprints in the chemoinformatics literature (Willett, 2006), when
cast in kernel SVM (Ralaivola et (11., 2005; Swamidass et (11., 2005;
Trotter, 2006) and spectral clustering frameworks, is able to achieve
performances often better than, and never worse than, using data
to the high numerical precision with which it is often reported and
archived.

1.1 Algorithmic variability during the preprocessing of
raw data

Several studies have explored the effect of algorithm choice
for preprocessing microarray data. The general consensus in the
community is that the overall results are highly dependent on
the algorithms used for preprocessing data. Most such studies
focus on detecting differentially expressed genes using a single
dataset (usually spike-in data) and compare the results of different
algorithms in quantifying the spiked-in concentration. A review of
this body of literature ﬁnds contradictory claims on the relative
performance of algorithms. Part of the explanation for such
contradictions arises from comparisons being made on different
datasets at the level of observed gene expression.

Irizarry et (11. (2003b) introduced the robust multiarray analysis
(RMA) method for analysing Affymetrix data and compared it to
previously used methods (dCHIP and MAS5.0). This study mentions
there is no standard way to compare the effect of the algorithm
choice, and evaluates the results using three criteria on a single
dataset. While in these evaluations RMA performs best amongst the
three algorithms, Choe et (11.’s (2005) study provides contradictory
results on the same algorithms, but using a different dataset. Choe
et (11. (2005) use the affy package and consider 152 different
combinations of algorithms and report their best combination, which
turns out to be none of the above three. Speciﬁcally with respect to
adjusting the perfect match (PM) probe intensity, the authors favour
the performance of MAS5.0, and explicitly note a contradiction with
Irizarry et (11.’s (2003b) claim. A recent study by Pearson (2008)
also notes contradictory claims on the results obtained from spiked-
in data. Other examples of contradictory claims can be seen in
Shedden et (11. (2005), Ploner et (11. (2005), Qin et (11. (2006) and
Millenaar et (11. (2006). Noting that the algorithms compared lead to
different levels of gene expressions, the common recommendation
of those studies’ for the user is to test many possible algorithms
before arriving at gene expression levels. This, however, has serious
computational implications and is generally infeasible.

1.2 Motivation

As reviewed above, gene expression values obtained by different
preprocessing algorithms yield different results. We use a gene
selection problem to illustrate the impact of this variation. We
took the dataset of a breast cancer study (West et (11., 2001) and
computed the 50 most discriminant genes that could be used as
hypothetical markers for discrimination. These genes were selected
using the Fisher’s ratio as criterion, as is commonly done (Golub
et (11., 1999). We notice substantial differences in the genes that
were identiﬁed as carrying the most discriminant information in
three different algorithmic combinations, as shown in the confusion
matrix of Table l. The three algorithmic combinations chosen
here correspond to those achieving the minimum, maximum and
mean class prediction performance of an SVM classiﬁer, measured
in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristics
curve (AUROC). The names of the genes selected are given in
Supplementary Table S4. The selected genes between the best and
the worst performing classiﬁers overlap by only about 50%.

This observation motivates a systematic study to explore the
variability in inference quality caused by the choice of algorithms in
the preprocessing stages, and possible approaches to reducing this
variability. As we report in the remainder of this article, a binary
representation with kernel classiﬁcation in high-dimensional spaces

is able to achieve a drastic reduction in the variability caused by
algorithmic choice.

2 APPROACH

2.1 Experiments

Our approach to demonstrating the variability due to preprocessing
algorithm choice, and its reduction by a binarized data
representation, was to perform training and testing of large numbers
of classiﬁers on eight datasets taken from the archives. To this end,
we restricted ourselves to datasets from Affymetrix arrays because
of the very wide range of preprocessing algorithms for this class of
arrays available in R packages. We were also constrained by the need
for a reasonable dataset size (we used datasets with a minimum size
of 20) to allow reliable cross validations by partitioning into training
and test sets.

We used SVMs as classiﬁers. Microarray data being usually
of high dimensions, SVMs tend to be the classiﬁers of choice
in the machine learning literature (Brown et (11., 2000; Dettling,
2004; Statnikov et (11., 2005). For comparison with an alternative,
we implemented K-nearest neighbour classiﬁers. We found the
SVMs consistently outperformed the nearest neighbour approach
in these problems (see results in Supplementary Material). Since
the nearest neighbour approach suffers from the well-known curse
of dimensionality issue (Bishop, 2006; Duda et (11., 2001) any
difference in performance as a result of data representation will
be masked by this aspect. We also considered the use of distance-
to-template classiﬁers, in the light of Zilliox and Irizarry’s (2007)
bar-code work, and chose not to pursue this for a technical reason
supported by our previous work (Tuna and Niranjan, 2009). It is a
basic result in statistical pattern recognition that distance-to-template
classiﬁers, where the templates stored are class-means, rely on
the assumption of isotropic (each feature being independent) and
equal variances (Duda et (11., 2001) for optimal performance. With
microarray data, this assumption is unlikely to be true because genes
are bound to show correlated expression arising from, for example,
co-regulation by common transcription factors. See Supplementary
Material for results of nearest neighbour and distance-to-template
classiﬁers as a function of dimensionality. Kernel classiﬁers such
as SVMs do not rely on such assumptions and are able to form
complex class boundaries by capturing higher order correlations
in the feature space. We report results using the AUROC as the
performance measure, and for each preprocessing method, computed
AUROCs by averaging over 50 random partitionings sampled with
replacement of the data into training and test sets. Some authors
restrict their results to single training and evaluation sets, often the
partition determined by the original suppliers of the data. Given
data sizes are usually small, this practice runs the risk of ‘reporting
good news’ when an algorithm accidentally performs well on the
particular test set. Averaging over 50 bootstrap partitions avoids
this pitfall. In the above experimental setting, we quantiﬁed the
variability in classiﬁer performance using the continuous valued
data, data quantized to binary precision using a linear kernel SVM,
and binary data classiﬁed using a Tanimoto kernel SVM. The
Tanimoto similarity metric is borrowed from the chemoinformatics
literature where it has been used very effectively in comparing
molecules using ﬁngerprints of their chemical properties. Thus,
it is seen as a good metric for high-dimensional binary spaces.

(1999).

Trotter (2006) shows how such a similarity metric can be used in
a kernel SVM framework, and our own previous work has shown
this metric yields good results for microarray data as well (Tuna and
Niranjan, 2009, 2010).

Figure 1 is an illustration, in the form of ‘heatmaps’, of the
effect of binarization in gene expression. Noise in the continuous
valued data Figure 1a is lost when expression levels are discretized
as in Figure lb. The data used here is from the widely studied
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) versus acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) classiﬁcation problem of Golub et (11. (1999). While such a
‘heatmap’ illustration shows that discrimination between the classes
is retained with binarized data, the reader should be cautious that the
actual classiﬁer design is taking place in a very high-dimensional
space that cannot be visualized directly.

One difﬁculty encountered in comparing multiple preprocessing
algorithms is the fact that not all algorithms lead to valid gene
expressions on all datasets. We found implementations of several
algorithmic combinations failed to complete analysis of the input
data. Notably there was no consistency in these failures, and hence
of the 315 combinations available in the package we used only 179
algorithmic combinations that were common across all eight datasets
for our main results. Such an observation is also made in Bolstad
(2004). We report results using this common set, but note that the
numbers of algorithms used was not a factor in the conclusions we
are able to reach.

3 MATERIALS AND METHODS
3.1 Datasets

All eight datasets considered in this study used Affymetrix microarray
platforms and raw data are available as CEL ﬁles. All probes in the array
were used in setting up classiﬁcation experiments and no feature selection
is applied prior to classiﬁcation. Some combinations of preprocessing
algorithms returned missing values for some gene expressions (reported by
the algorithms as N/A). In these cases, the gene in question was removed

from the classiﬁer design for that particular preprocessing algorithm. Below
is the description of each dataset used and the GEO accession number or the
authors’ web page where these datasets are freely available to download:

0 Two prostate cancer datasets: the ﬁrst, GSE6956, has 22 277 probe-sets
with 89 samples, of which 69 are prostate and 20 are normal (Wallace
et (11., 2008). The second has 12625 probe-sets with 102 samples, of
which 52 are prostate and 50 are normal (http://www.broad.mit.edu/;
Singh et (11., 2002).

0 Two lung cancer datasets: the ﬁrst, GSE7670, has 22283 probe-sets
with 66 samples, of which 30 are normal and 36 are cancer (Su et (11.,
2007). The second, GSE10072, also has 22283 probe-sets with 107
samples, of which 58 are cancer and 49 are normal (Landi et (11., 2008).

0 Two breast cancer datasets: the ﬁrst, GSE5847, has 22283 probe-sets
with 95 samples, of which 47 are normal and 48 are cancer (Boersma
et (11., 2007). Second, obtained from http://data.genome.duke.edu/west
.php, has 7129 genes and 49 samples, (25 ERT and 24 ER‘; West
at (11., 2001).

0 Lymph node versus tonsil problem: (GSE2665) 22283 probe-sets with
20 samples; 10 lymph node and 10 tonsils (Martens et (11., 2006).

0 Childhood ALL: (GSE3910) 22283 probe-sets with 70 samples; 35 for
each diagnosis and relapse (Bhojwani et (11., 2006).

Amongst these eight datasets, ﬁve used Affymetrix array U133A, which
contains 22283 probe-sets. Singh et al.’s (2002) and West et al.’s (2001) data
come from Hum9 5AV2 and HuGeneFL arrays, respectively. Lastly, Wallace
et al.’s (2008) dataset used U13 3A2 . 0 array. These differences cause the
total numbers of probe-sets to differ between the datasets.

3.2 Preprocessing algorithms

To select different preprocessing algorithms, we used the expres so module
implemented in the affy package (Gautier et (11., 2004; Irizarry et (11.,
2003a) available in Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/). In this
implementation, the different stages of the preprocessing pipeline available,
with the numbers of algorithms at each stage given in parentheses, are:
background correction (3), normalization (7), probe-speciﬁc correction (3)
and summary method (5), giving a total of 315 different combinations, as
shown in Table 2.

3.3 Quantization

For quantization of the continuous data into binary, we used the mixture
Gaussian approach developed by Zhou et a1. (2003). While there are several
alternative approaches to quantizing, which usually rely on setting some
threshold, this particular method was preferred because it uses a probability
density model of the data, making it a more principled approach. Mixture

corresponding means and SDs of the models were calculated. Using these
parameters, a quantization threshold was set as

Fitting the model was done by standard maximum likelihood techniques,
and we used the gmm function in NETLAB software (http://www.ncrg.aston
.ac.uk) for this purpose. Quantization was applied on an array by array basis.
While there are other choices (gene by gene or a global threshold across all
the data), our previous experience showed there was not much difference in
performance over a range of threshold settings (Tuna and Niranjan, 2010).
An example of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) ﬁt to a histogram of gene
expressions is shown in Figure 2.

3.4 Tanimoto kernel

Tanimoto similarity for two genes x and y is calculated as T = c/(a+b— c),
where a is the number of arrays in which x is expressed, 11 the number of
arrays in which y is expressed and c the number of arrays in which both
x and y are expressed. This similarity metric has been used as a kernel for
SVMs (Ralaivola et (11., 2005; Swamidass et (11., 2005; Trotter, 2006). The
Tanimoto kernel is deﬁned as

T

X Z
KTan(Xv 1) =

xTx+sz—xTz' (3)

We implemented Tanimoto kernel in the MATLAB SVM package of Steve
Gunn (http://www.isis.ecs.soton.ac.uk/isystems/kernel/) and the results of
the classiﬁcation were evaluated by means of AUROC. Classiﬁcation
experiments were performed using 50 random partitions of the data into
training and test sets. Sampling with replacement was used to construct these
bootstrap datasets.

3.5 Fisher’s ratio
The Fisher’s ratio is deﬁned as

1 ; abs —

Fisher’s ratio =  (4)
01 +02

where 111, (n and 112, (72 are the means and SDs of the ﬁrst and second

classes, respectively. The Fisher’s ratio as a measure of the ability of a feature

to separate two classes is in common use in microarray class prediction

literature, starting from the work (Golub et (11., 1999).

3.6 Statistical signiﬁcance

To compare statistical signiﬁcances of the difference in variances, we used
the F -test as implemented in MATLAB, and similarly used the t-test to test
for signiﬁcance in differences between means.

4 RESULTS

Figure 3 shows the classiﬁcation results obtained with different
preprocessing algorithms using AUROC as criterion on eight
different class prediction tasks. These box plots show that
binarization consistently achieves a reduction in the variability
of classiﬁer performance. Most importantly, we note substantial
improvement in a number of outlier results (Fig. 3f—h) owing to
the binary data representation.

Table 3 and 4 show the variance and mean respectively
achieved by the three methods across the 179 different
preprocessing algorithms. Statistical signiﬁcance of differences
in these, where the continuous and binary linear methods are
compared against the binary Tanimoto approach are shown
as P-values of F-tests. We note that on all but one of the
eight problems considered here [the exception being Wallace
et (11. (2008)], variability caused by algorithmic choice was
signiﬁcantly reduced (P<0.001) by the binarization of the
data. However, there is signiﬁcant improvement in the average
performance in this dataset (see Supplementary Table S1 for the
differences in mean performances and associated levels of statistical
signiﬁcances).

5 DISCUSSION

Why does binarization help, in reduction in variability as we have
observed here, and in prediction of tissue types as demonstrated
in Zilliox and Irizarry (2007)? We suggest that a low numerical
precision representation is more compatible with the environment
from which microarray data are gathered, than the arbitrary length
of decimal places to which they are usually reported and archived.
Except in a small number of cases like cell-cycle regulation
studies, where the cellular states are artiﬁcially synchronized,
mRNA extraction is from a heterogeneous population of cells,
each of which having a small number of copies of the mRNA
species. This causes large variation in measurements across different
sub-populations from the same biological sample—the so-called
biological variability. A critical survey of microarray studies by
Draghici et (11. (2006) concluded: ‘...the existence and direction of
gene expression changes can be reliably detected for the majority
of genes. However, accurate measurements of absolute expression
levels and the reliable detection of low abundance genes are
currently beyond the reach of microarray technology’. As such,
when the data representation precision matches the reality of the
underlying measurement, several advantages follow, of which the
algorithmic variability reduction reported here is one.

Note that the reduction in variability of performance we
claim has only been demonstrated with SVM as classiﬁers.
We did not observe this variability with the nearest neighbour
classiﬁer, overall performance of which were far worse than
SVM. Hence this variability reduction should be seen as resulting
from a combination of quantization and a high-dimensional
representation separated by large margins (the optimization criterion
of SVM). On the expression of an individual gene on a speciﬁc
patient, however, binarization does not always give consistent
ON/OFF outcome. This is because the quantization threshold is
chosen by ﬁtting a model through a distribution of expressions
after a particular pre-processing combination is applied. Thus,
we caution the reader against interpreting the results at the

6 CONCLUSION

In this article, we address the variability in the results of
inferences from transcriptome studies that arises from the choice
of preprocessing algorithms. This variability has previously been

shown to have a signiﬁcant effect on the gene expressions measured
by microarrays. Our work reported here shows that the binary
representation helps signiﬁcantly in reducing this algorithmic
choice induced variability in classiﬁcation problems, when used in
combination with a high-dimensional kernel method.

While previous studies have largely focused on pointing out
that such a variability exists by reference to how well-measured
expressions of a gene correlates with spiked-in concentration or with

drawn, in the context of classiﬁcation problems. To the best of our
knowledge, comparisons of inference algorithms on microarray data
(e.g. support vector machines versus nearest neighbour as predictors
of phenotype), of which there is a very large body of literature in
the statistical and machine learning communities, are based on the
application of one set of preprocessing algorithms, often published
by the original authors of a particular study. Given the variability
we observe, we believe there is room for scepticism of conclusions
drawn from such studies.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of
biological processes in plants and animals. Recently, miRNA genes
have been discovered, whose primary transcripts are spliced and
which cannot be predicted directly from genomic sequence. Hence,
more sophisticated programs for the detection of spliced miRNAs
are required.

Results: Here, we present the first method for the prediction of
spliced miRNAs in plants. For a given genomic sequence, SplamiR
creates a database of complementary sequence pairs, which might
encode for RNAs folding into stem—loop structures. Next, in silico
splice variants of database sequences with complementarity to an
mRNA of interest are classified as to whether they could represent
miRNAs targeting this mRNA. Our method identifies all known cases
of spliced miRNAs in rice, and a previously undiscovered miRNA
in maize which is supported by an expressed sequence tag (EST).
SplamiR permits identification of spliced miRNAs for a given target
mRNA in many plant genomes.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (~22 nt), non-coding RNAs which
generally negatively regulate gene expression (Bartel, 2004; He
and Hannon, 2004). These short RNAs were ﬁrst studied in
Caenorhabditis elegans (Lee et al., 1993; Wightman et al., 1991) and
Drosophila melanogaster (Lai and Posakony, 1997), but the term
miRNA was coined later (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2001). Since their
discovery, miRNAs have been identiﬁed in a number of animals,
plants and viruses (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002; Molnar et al., 2007;
Pasquinelli et al., 2000; Pfeffer et al., 2004; Reinhart et al., 2002;
Wang,J.F. et al., 2004). In plants and animals, miRNAs regulate
many biological processes (Carrington and Ambros, 2003; Stefani
and Slack, 2008), while virus miRNAs mainly target host mRNAs

involved in antiviral response, cell proliferation and apoptosis
(Pfeffer et al., 2004).

Plant miRNAs are key regulators of a variety of developmental
processes, including root development (Boualem et al., 2008; Guo
et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005), vascular development (Kim et al.,
2005; Zhou,G.K. et al., 2007), ﬂower development (Chen, 2004;
Nag et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009), leaf morphogenesis (Palatnik
et al., 2003) and phase change from vegetative to reproductive
development (Lauter et al., 2005). In addition, plant miRNAs
are crucial for controlling stress responses as well as nutrient
homeostasis (Fujii et al., 2005; Hsieh et al., 2009; Navarro et al.,
2006; Sunkar et al., 2006).

In plants, a miRNA gene is commonly transcribed by RNA
polymerase II (Lee et al., 2004), giving rise to a primary miRNA
transcript (pri-miRNA), which folds into a stem—loop structure
(Pasquinelli et al., 2000). Next, mainly unpaired nucleotides at the
3’ and 5’ ends are cleaved by a multiprotein complex, resulting in
a pre-miRNA (Han et al., 2004; Hiraguri et al., 2005; Kim et al.,
2008; Lobbes et al., 2006). Pre-miRNAs feature a huge diversity of
lengths (Axtell and Bowman, 2008). Further processing of the pre-
miRNA generates a miRNA:miRNA* duplex structure composed
of the mature miRNA and its complementary part, the miRNA*
(Grishok et al., 2001; Kurihara and Watanabe, 2004). This duplex
exhibits high complementarity, including the standard Watson—
Crick as well as G:U wobble base pairs, with generally less than
four mismatches, and rare and small asymmetric bulges (Meyers
et al., 2008). The miRNA:miRNA* duplex is either exported to the
cytoplasm, where it is unwound, or it is unwound in the nucleus
and the mature miRNA is exported to the cytoplasm (Park et al.,
2005). After incorporation into the RNA-induced silencing complex
(RISC), the mature miRNA guides the recognition of the target
mRNA, which then leads to post-transcriptional regulation of this
mRNA (Hutvagner and Zamore, 2002; Vaucheret et al., 2004).
Featuring standard and wobble base pairs, with usually less than four
mismatches and few bulges, the miRNA is highly complementary to
its target mRNA. This way, plant miRNAs generally guide mRNA
cleavage (Rhoades et al., 2002). The minimum length of mature
miRNAs in plants is 16 nt (Llave et al., 2002).

Some primary transcripts of miRNAs contain introns (Sunkar
et al., 2005; Xie et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2009). In most published
cases, the characteristic stem—loop structure is encoded by one of
the exons of the miRNA gene. Recently, however, intron-containing
miRNA genes have been identiﬁed for which the stem—loop structure
cannot be predicted based on the unspliced primary transcript
(hereafter referred to as priU-miRNA) (Kutter et al., 2007; Lu
et al., 2008; Sunkar et al., 2005). Several of these spliced miRNAs
belong to the miR444 family which has only been identiﬁed in

Poaceae (grasses) (Lu et al., 2008; Sunkar et al., 2005). Six members
of the miR444 family have been detected in Oryza sativa L.ssp.
japonica (cv. Nipponbare) (rice), termed miR444a—f. The primary
transcripts of miR444a—f contain an intron and only after this has
been removed, the typical hairpin structure can be recognized. In
all cases, the exon—exon junction is located in or close to the loop
of the stem—loop structure of the pre-miRNA (Lu et al., 2008). The
members of the miR444 family in rice target the mRNAs of four
MADS-box genes, namely 0sMADS23, 0sMADS27, 0sMADS57
and 0sMADS6I (Li et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2008; Sunkar et al.,
2005). Most introns in miRNAs feature the canonical splice motif
GU-AG (Sunkar et al., 2005; Xie et al., 2005; Zhang et al.,
2009).

The prediction of miRNA genes in plants is considerably more
difﬁcult than in animals due to a greater heterogeneity of stem—loop
structures of plant pre-miRNAs (Axtell and Bowman, 2008; Mendes
et al., 2009). Hence, fewer algorithms exist for the prediction of
miRNAs in plants than in animals. The available approaches can
be subdivided into homology-based searches and ab initio methods,
where the latter ones also allow the prediction of non-conserved
miRNAs (Mendes et al., 2009). Current methods for the ab initio
prediction of miRNA genes in plants depend on expressed sequence
tag (EST) sequences (Jin et al., 2008; Wen et al., 2008) or rely on
the predictability of the stem—loop structure from genomic sequence
(Adai et al., 2005; Bonnet et al., 2004; Jones-Rhoades and Bartel,
2004; Kadri et al., 2009; Lindow et al., 2007; Teune and Steger,
2010; Wang,X.J. et al., 2004; Xue et al., 2005).

Several tools exist for the prediction and assessment of the
interaction between miRNAs and their target mRNAs in plants
(Bonnet et al., 2010; Rehmsmeier et al., 2004; Xie and Zhang, 2010;
Zhang, 2005). All programs require the mature miRNA as input and
consider a high degree of complementarity between the miRNA and
its target mRNA with few mismatches and bulges as criterion for
interaction of a miRNA and an mRNA. Some programs additionally
use criteria such as the estimated minimum free energy of the
interaction between the miRNA and its target mRNA (Bonnet et al.,
2010; Rehmsmeier et al., 2004) or the evolutionary conservation of
this interaction (Zhang, 2005).

Transcripts of miRNAs are underrepresented in EST databases
due to their short length and potentially low expression rate. This
fact, and the difﬁculties with the computational detection of spliced
miRNAs for which the typical hairpin structure cannot be predicted
from genomic sequence, provoke the question of how many of these
key regulators remain unidentiﬁed in plants.

Here, we present the ﬁrst method which is able to predict plant pre-
miRNAs encoded by intron-containing genes for a given potential
target mRNA. Our method SplamiR (SJﬂiced plant m_iRNAs),
combines the well-established bioinformatic tools BLAST (Altschul
et al., 1990), GeneSplicer (Pertea et al., 2001) and miR-abela
(Sewer et al., 2005) to identify candidate pre-miRNAs in whole
genomes whose mature miRNAs likely regulate an mRNA of
interest. SplamiR consists of two phases; in Phase 1, sequence pairs
with a high degree of complementarity are identiﬁed from whole
genome or chromosome sequences; and in Phase 2, sequences with
complementarity to a given potential target mRNA are searched
among those sequence pairs, possible splicing events are considered,
and secondary-structure characteristics are evaluated to identify
candidate pre-miRNAs. We apply SplamiR to the genomes of rice
and Zea mays ssp. mays L. (maize).

2 METHODS

2.1 Embedded bioinformatic tools

RNA structures cannot only exhibit the standard Watson43rick base pairs. but
also G:U wobble base pairs (Varani and McClain. 2000). To enable BLAST
(Altschul et al.. 1990) to identify sequence pairs on genomic level which
might encode for RNAs forming those stemiloop structures. we modiﬁed
BLAST internals. Sequence pairs with high complementarity are detected by
BLAST by generating the reverse complement and ﬁnding a sequence with
high similarity to this reverse complement (Fig. 1). This approach implies.
that sequence pairs encoding for a G:U wobble base pair are found by BLAST
when comparing G to A (as A is the complement of U/T) or T to C (as C is
the complement of G). Thus. the scores for the comparisons of G to A and T
to C were increased from —3 to 0 in the internal nucleotide scoring matrix
of BLAST. We refer to this modiﬁed version of BLAST as GU-BLAST.

The interaction of the mature miRNA with its target mRNA can also
include G:U wobble base pairs (Allen et al.. 2005). Thus. GU-BLAST was
also used to ﬁnd complementary sequences to a given potential target mRNA.

GeneSplicer (Pertea et al.. 2001) predicts splice sites with a combination
of Markov modeling and decision tree techniques based on training data
for true and false splice sites. For this reason. to identify potential splice
sites. GeneSplicer was incorporated into SplamiR. The predictions were
performed using the provided rice training data which do not include the
genes encoding for spliced miRNAs and an acceptance threshold of —30 for
acceptor and donor sites. The web server of the miR-abela classiﬁer system
(Sewer et al.. 2005) was used with default settings to identify candidate pre-
miRNAs among generated putative pre-miRNAs. This program distinguishes
robust stems of miRNAs from other RNAs with a support vector machine
using features such as length. number and nature of bulges. and composition
of bases and base pairs of stemiloop structures.

2.2 Algorithm

2.2.] Phase I—generation of a database of complementary sequence pairs
Pre-miRNAs are characterized by a stemiloop structure (Meyers et al..
2008). In a genome such stemiloop structures are encoded by a stretch
of DNA which comprises a sequence pair of two highly complementary
sequences.

The comparison of G to A and of T to C corresponds to the G:U base pair

Fig. 2. The two phases of SplamiR. In Phase 1 (a). a database of complementary sequence pairs (shaded) is created which is then used as basis for the search

of candidate pre-miRNAs in Phase 2 (b).

Our method takes a sequence which can be as large as whole chromosomes
or genomes. as input and ﬁrst splits it into fragments of 30 000 nt that overlap
by 20 000 nt (Fig. 2a). The resulting fragments are then compared with each
other with our GU-BLAST using a word length of 9. For each comparison.
results of the GU-BLAST search are stored if they are in plus/minus-
direction. Overlapping hits and BLAST results with a length of <16 nt
and >500 nt are omitted. Each sequence of the remaining sequence pairs
is stored separately and contains a pointer to the complementary sequence.
A local BLAST database of these sequence pairs is created (Fig. 2a). This
database can be used in Phase 2 to be searched with a given potential
target mRNA. as well as to identify new members of a known miRNA
family and for comprehensive genome-wide screenings of all sequence
pa1rs.

2.2.2 Phase 2—ia’entiﬁcati0n of candidate pre-miRNAs The entire mature
miRNA exhibits high complementarity to its target mRNAs in plants
(Rhoades et al.. 2002). This information is used in Phase 2 of our method
SplamiR. The sequence of a potential target mRNA is used as input (Fig. 2b)
and is compared with the database of complementary sequence pairs using
our GU-BLAST with a word length of 9. This way. the number of considered
complementary sequence pairs is greatly reduced as compared with the whole
database. The e-Values of this GU-BLAST search are stored to later rank
candidate pre-miRNAs. For each of the resulting sequence pairs. the genomic
sequences are retrieved. ranging from 65 nt upstream of the 5’ end of the 5’-
most sequence of the pair. to 65 nt downstream of the 3’ end of the 3’-most
sequence of the pair (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. Sl). Representing
a set of putative priU-miRNAs. these sequences are subsequently scanned
for canonical splice sites using GeneSplicer. Each pair of thereby predicted
splice acceptors and splice donors is considered to frame an intron. Thus.
multiple in silico splice variants are generated for each genomic sequence
(Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. Sl). All of these variants as well as the
original genomic sequences form a set of putative pre-miRNAs. which are
then classiﬁed by miR-abela to verify whether they represent candidate
pre-miRNAs (Fig. 2b). Due to the fact that miR-abela only accepts input
sequences of a length of up to 1000 nt. longer putative pre-miRNAs are not
considered.

2.3 Datasets

For evaluation. we ﬁrst created a dataset of artiﬁcial spliced miRNAs. To do
so. we used 72 known. experimentally veriﬁed and not spliced pre-miRNAs
from rice which are correctly detectable as pre-miRNAs by miR-abela. Into
all of these pre-miRNAs. we introduced a known intron from rice as provided
from the The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) (Ouyang et al.. 2007)
at a random position around the middle of each of the sequences. This way.
we created 20 different constructs for every pre-miRNA. all with a different
intron. Thus. a dataset of 1440 artiﬁcial priU-miRNAs was generated. Each
of these artiﬁcial priU-miRNAs was put into a fragment of random DNA
sequence such that the resulting constructs had a length of 30 000 nt.

We collected experimentally veriﬁed and computationally predicted target
mRNAs from the literature (Huang et al.. 2009; Jian et al.. 2010; Jones-
Rhoades et al.. 2006; Lacombe et al.. 2008; Li et al.. 2010; Liu et al.. 2005;
Lu et al.. 2008; Luo et al.. 2006; Sunkar et al.. 2005. 2008; Wu et al.. 2009;
Xue et al.. 2009; Zhou et al.. 2010; Zhu et al.. 2008) for our dataset of
72 miRNAs. Using SplamiR. every construct containing an artiﬁcial priU-
miRNA was searched with each of the target mRNAs for the inserted miRNA
resulting in 4280 tests.

To evaluate SplamiR on known spliced miRNAs. we collected the
sequences of the pre-miRNAs of the miR444 family from rice (accession
numbers MIOOOl719. MIOOO6974-MIOOO6978) from miRBase (Grifﬁths-
Jones. 2004). The exoneintron boundaries and the sequence of the introns
were determined by alignment of the pre-miRNAs to the genomic sequence
of O.sativa ssp. japonica. release 6.1. which was retrieved from TIGR
(Ouyang et al.. 2007). The mRNA sequences of the predicted target genes of
the members of the miR444 family. OsMADS23. OsMADS27. OsMADS57
and OsMADS6I were also obtained from TIGR. where only the primary
splice form was considered. In case of OsMADS61. we assume that the
mRNA sequence is more likely a concatenation of the sequences given with
the identiﬁers LOC_OsO4g38770 and LOC_OSO4g38780.

To identify new pre-miRNAs. we retrieved the genome sequence of Z.
mays ssp. mays L. (Schnable et al.. 2009) from http://maizesequence.org.
A potential target gene of a member of the miR444 family in maize
is ZmMADS2 (Schreiber et al.. 2004). The mRNA sequence of
ZmMADS2 (accession number AF112149) and an EST sequence

(accession number: EE182122) corresponding to the pre-miRNA were
obtained from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
(Benson et al., 2010).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Rationale for integrated tools and applied
constraints

The presented method for the prediction of spliced miRNAs makes
use of two crucial characteristics of plant miRNAs. First, the high
complementarity between the mature miRNA and the miRNA*
in the duplex structure of the pre-miRNA (Meyers et al., 2008)
is the reasoning behind the construction of a database of highly
complementary sequence pairs in Phase 1 of SplamiR. Secondly,
miRNAs are highly complementary to their target mRNA (Rhoades
et al., 2002), which is used as criterion for Phase 2 of our method.

3.1.] Phase I In Phase 1, SplamiR identiﬁes highly
complementary sequence pairs within the input sequence using our
GU-BLAST. By altering the internal nucleotide scoring matrix, the
e-value is lowered for the comparison of complementary sequence
pairs which might encode for stem—loop structures including
G:U wobble base pairs. Thus, more sequences are identiﬁed and
resulting sequences are likely longer than those for which G:U
wobble base pairs are not considered.

BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) was chosen for this task as it
enables fast comparison of sequences. To ensure fast prediction,
secondary structures are not computed at this stage but are used for
classiﬁcation when applying miR-abela (Sewer et al., 2005) at the
end of Phase 2 of our method.

Identiﬁcation of an excessive number of complementary sequence
pairs representing low complexity regions in this step is prevented
by applying the build-in ﬁlters of BLAST. In contrast, transposable
elements were purposely not excluded as some miRNAs evolved
from these elements (Piriyapongsa and Jordan, 2008; Piriyapongsa
et al., 2007).

To further speed up the search, the input sequence is split
into fragments of 30 000 nt which overlap by 20 000 nt (Fig. 2a).
By choosing these fragment and overlap sizes, it is ensured that
sequence pairs can be identiﬁed which are as much as 20 000 nt
apart. When splicing is considered in Phase 2, the sequence in
between the complementary sequence pairs might be predicted to
represent an intron. Thus, priU-miRNAs which contain an intron
with a length of nearly 20 000 nt are predictable by our method.
Intronic sequences in plants usually range from 60 to 10 000nt
(Lorkovic et al., 2000). The members of the miR444 family have
introns with lengths between 1 189 to 6721 nt (Lu et al., 2008; Sunkar
et al., 2005). Accordingly, our method is likely able to detect most
spliced miRNAs in plants.

If a genomic region identiﬁed by the GU-BLAST search encodes
for a pre-miRNA, then the length of the result approximately
corresponds to the length of one arm of its stem—loop structure, and
thus represents roughly half of the length of its complete structure.
The results of the GU-BLAST search are stored if they have lengths
between 16 and 500 nt. The minimum length of 16 nt reﬂects the
minimum length of the miRNA:miRNA* duplex (Llave et al., 2002).
The maximum length of 500 nt was chosen as the maximal length of
putative pre-miRNA sequences which can be tested by miR-abela

is 1000 nt, and lengths of currently stored pre-miRNAs of ﬂowering
plants (Magnoliophyta) in miRBase (Grifﬁths-Jones, 2004) range
between 54 and 734 nt. Thus, our minimal and maximal values of
16 and 500 nt, respectively, for one arm of the stem—loop sequence
seem reasonable.

3.1.2 Phase 2 In Phase 2 of our method, candidate pre-miRNAs
which might regulate a given potential mRNA are identiﬁed
(Fig. 2b). To do so, GU-BLAST is used to ﬁnd sequences in
the database of complementary sequence pairs which are also
complementary to the given input mRNA. Again, for fast prediction,
minimum free energy or other constraints on the degree of
complementarity as deduced from experimental ﬁndings are not
considered at this stage. Available target prediction tools were also
not incorporated as they require the sequence of a mature miRNA
as input (Bonnet et al., 2010; Rehmsmeier et al., 2004; Xie and
Zhang, 2010; Zhang, 2005). The mature miRNA cannot be inferred
from predicted pre-miRNAs. However, we suggest an application
of these tools on candidate miRNAs predicted by our method. The
region with complementarity to the target gene of each candidate
pre-miRNA could be split into fragments with a length of ~20 nt
and these fragments could then be used as input for available target
prediction tools.

As we aim at the prediction of spliced miRNAs, the exon—intron
boundaries of the retrieved putative priU-miRNAs need to be
determined. Different gene prediction tools (Brejova et al., 2005;
Korf, 2004; Majoros et al., 2004) failed to detect the exon—intron
structure for our test cases. However, GeneSplicer (Pertea et al.,
2001) appeared to be suitable for the detection of potential splice
sites in putative priU-miRNAs.

GeneSplicer only detects canonical GU and AG splicing motifs.
As known introns in miRNA genes generally feature these canonical
splicing motifs (Sunkar et al., 2005; Xie et al., 2005; Zhang et al.,
2009), the use of GeneSplicer does not seem to impose serious
restrictions.

For the detection of splicing motifs, GeneSplicer uses a sliding
window of 80 nt. To allow the detection of splicing motifs with
a distance of just >15 nt from the 5’ end of the upstream-most
sequence or from the 3’ end of the downstream-most sequence of the
complementary sequence pair, 65 nt genomic sequence were added
to the 5’ end and the 3’ end of the complementary sequence pairs
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

For each putative priU-miRNA, all possible combinations of
predicted splice donors and acceptors are used to create in silico
splice variants. Each splice variant is tested whether it represents a
candidate pre-miRNA. The ﬁill genomic sequence is also considered
to allow the detection of pre-miRNAs for which the corresponding
miRNA genes do not contain introns.

Pertaining to our method, there are four different relevant
exon—intron structures in primary transcripts of miRNAs
(Supplementary Fig. S2). First, after removal of introns, the pre-
miRNA folds into a structure in which exon—exon junctions are
located between one of the ends of the structure and the miRNA
or the miRNA* (section I in Supplementary Fig. S2a). In these
most common cases, removal of the intron is not necessary for
the prediction of the stem—loop structure (Xie et al., 2005; Zhang
et al., 2009). These pre-miRNAs can be detected by both, standard
miRNA-prediction programs and SplamiR. Secondly, there are cases
where the exon—exon junction is located in the part of the structure

SplamiR

 

which is enclosed by the miRNA and the miRNA* (section III in
Supplementary Fig. S2b) (Lu et al., 2008; Sunkar et al., 2005).
These cases are covered by SplamiR. Thirdly, it is possible, that priU-
miRNAs contain multiple introns for which the exon—exon junctions
are located in the part of the pre-miRNA structure which is enclosed
by the miRNA and the miRNA* (section III in Supplementary
Fig. S2c). Even though no such pre-miRNAs are known so far,
our method is likely able to detect those pre-miRNAs. In this
case, the splice donor of the upstream-most intron and the splice
acceptor of the downstream-most intron are considered as ﬂanking
a single intron and an in silica splice variant is created which is
similar to the actual pre-miRNA but has a shorter loop section. This
putative pre-miRNA likely passes the succeeding classiﬁcation step
as the shorter loop section presumably does not negatively inﬂuence
its classiﬁcation. Finally, an exon—exon junction could be located
in the part of the structure giving rise to the miRNA:miRNA*
duplex (section II in Supplementary Fig. S2d). Our method is not
able to detect these pre-miRNAs in case the remaining sequence
complementarity is insufﬁcient for identiﬁcation. However, no such
pre-miRNAs are known so far.

Only a few programs exist for the classiﬁcation of plant miRNAs
(Adai et al., 2005; Bonnet et al., 2004; Jones-Rhoades and Bartel,
2004; Lindow and Krogh, 2005; Wang,X.J. et al., 2004). These
programs are not suitable to be incorporated into SplamiR as
they only predict conserved miRNAs or have a low speciﬁcity.
Thus, classiﬁcation programs trained for animal miRNAs (Hertel
and Stadler, 2006; Lai et al., 2003; Lim et al., 2003; Sewer
et al., 2005) were tested. On a dataset of nearly 4000 randomly
chosen RNA sequences (excluding miRNAs) of ﬂowering plants
(Magnoliophyta) taken from Rfam (Gardner et al., 2009) and 600
randomly chosen known pre-miRNAs of ﬂowering plants listed
in miRBase, miR-abela yielded a sensitivity and a speciﬁcity of
99.8 and 58.8%, respectively. Hence, miR-abela was incorporated
into SplamiR. Even though SplamiR’s detection rate is good using
miR-abela, it can be easily increased once algorithms become
available, which allow better classiﬁcation of plant pre-miRNAs,
by substituting miR-abela by these new algorithms.

Like most other methods for the prediction of miRNAs (Bonnet
et al., 2004; Hertel and Stadler, 2006; Lim et al., 2003; Lindow and
Krogh, 2005), our method predicts pre-miRNAs. The exact position
of the mature miRNA cannot be determined in all cases, especially
in cases where more than one mature miRNA is excisable from one
pre-miRNA (Lu et al., 2008; Molnar et al., 2007; Xie et al., 2005).
However, in many cases, the position of the mature miRNA can be
conﬁned as the mature miRNA is highly complementary to the target
mRNA (Rhoades et al., 2002).

3.1.3 Time and memory usage As indicated above, the integrated
tools ensure fast performance of SplamiR. On a 2.5GHz single
core system processing of 1MB of genomic sequence in Phase 1
takes 13s on average. The approximate computation time for
searching the database with a target mRNA, generation of splice
variants and classiﬁcation of putative pre-miRNAs is 2h per
genome. Thereby, the computation time is heavily dependent on
the number of splice variants. Generation and classiﬁcation of one
splice variant takes ~14 s. Memory usage is low, <256 MB, in both
phases of SplamiR. Hence, pre-miRNAs can be predicted on whole
genome sequences in modest time using little memory with our
method.

3.2 Simulation studies

In order to evaluate the performance of SplamiR, we conducted
simulation studies on a dataset of artiﬁcial priU-miRNAs and their
corresponding target mRNAs. The artiﬁcial priU-miRNAs were
generated by combining each of 72 known, not spliced pre-miRNAs
from rice with 20 known rice introns. These constructs, as well as
target mRNAs of the 72 miRNAs as identiﬁed from the literature,
were used as input for SplamiR for our simulation studies.

3.2.] Phase 1 Searching our dataset of 1440 constructs
containing artiﬁcial priU-miRNAs resulted in 943 cases with the
identiﬁcation of the correct sequence pair corresponding to the
inserted pre-miRNA (:l:50 nt). This is equivalent to a reasonable
sensitivity of 65.5% of Phase 1 of SplamiR. In total, 2558
complementary sequence pairs were detected, of which 60.6% are
false positive results. Hence, prediction of spliced miRNAs without
prior knowledge of target mRNAs may be challenging with SplamiR
as all false complementary sequence pairs would also be considered
in Phase 2. In contrast, searching the database using a target mRNA
greatly reduces the number of considered false positive sequence
pairs as discussed below.

3.2.2 Phase 2 We conducted 4280 tests searching all of the
1440 constructs with each target mRNA of the inserted miRNA. In
2790 of these tests a sequence pair matching approximately to the
inserted pre-miRNA (:l:100 nt) could be identiﬁed. This equates to a
sensitivity of 65.2% of this step of SplamiR. In total, 5086 sequence
pairs with complementarity to the target mRNA were detected. Only
43 (0.8%) of these sequence pairs do not coincide with the inserted
pre-miRNA and represent false positive results.

A total of 17 392 splice variants was created, i.e. an average of
3.4 splice variants per identiﬁed priU-miRNA. Overall, 1454 of
the created splice variants were classiﬁed positively by miR-abela
(Sewer et al., 2005). Once again, the number of false positives was
low with only 26 (1.8%) positively classiﬁed pre-miRNAs which
do not correspond to an inserted miRNA. In 910 cases of the 4280
interactions tested a splice variant coinciding with the inserted pre-
miRNA (:l:100 nt) was positively classiﬁed as candidate pre-miRNA
by miR-abela. This equates to a sensitivity of 21.3% for Phase 2 of
SplamiR.

There is a strong decrease from 2790 tests for which the correct
complementary sequence pair was identiﬁed from the database
to 910 tests for which a valid pre-miRNA was detected. This
reduction is caused by application of GeneSplicer (Pertea et al.,
2001) and miR-abela (Sewer et al., 2005). Our artiﬁcial priU-
miRNAs are composed of known introns from rice and known
pre-miRNAs which are split into two artiﬁcial exons. It is possible
that GeneSplicer does not recognize correct splice sites in our dataset
as our artiﬁcial exons likely miss important recognition sites. Hence,
sensitivity of SplamiR might be even higher on genuine spliced
pre-miRNAs than the result of the simulation studies suggest.

3.3 Test case: miR444 family in rice

The members of the miR444 family contain introns in a way that the
characteristic stem—loop structure could previously not be predicted
from genomic sequences (Lu et al., 2008; Sunkar et al., 2005).
Consequently, to evaluate our method on known spliced miRNAs,
it was applied to the 12 chromosomes of rice in combination with

Number of sequences handled at each step in Phase 2 of SplamiR when using the four
target mRNAs of the miR444 family of miRNAs as input sequences. Putative pre-
miRNAs are in silica splice variants which have not been tested using miR-abela yet.
In silica splice variants which have been Classiﬁed as pre-miRNAs by miR-abela are
termed candidate pre-miRNAs. Details about unique loci are shown in Supplementary
Table S 1.

the target mRNAs of the members of the miR444 family, namely
0sMADS23, 0sMADS27, 0sMADS57 and 0sMADS6I (Li et al.,
2010; Lu et al., 2008; Sunkar et al., 2005).

In Phase 1, 730146 complementary sequence pairs were found
in rice and stored in our database. Among these sequence pairs
are sequences of all six miR444-family members. When querying
this database with the target mRNA 0sMADS23, 54 sequence
pairs are found for which one of the two subsequences is
highly complementary to this input mRNA (Table 1). Again,
sequences of all six miR444-family members are among the putative
priU-miRNAs.

Scanning the corresponding genomic regions of all 54 putative
priU-miRNAs using GeneSplicer and generating all possible in
silica splice variants, results in a total of 318 putative pre-miRNAs
with a length of <1000 nt (Table 1). In case of the six miR444-
family members, GeneSplicer is able to predict the correct donor
and acceptor splice sites. However, the correct splice site is not
always the one with the best score in GeneSplicer. For example, the
score for the real donor site of miR444a was 6.73 and thus decisively
worse than the score of 0.03 for a predicted donor site in the same
sequence. The number of splice sites ranges from one donor and
two acceptor sites (miR444e and miR444f) to ﬁve donor and ﬁve
acceptor sites (miR444a). Applying this step to all priU-miRNAs
of the six miR444-family members, results in 15 in silica splice
variants <1000 nt for miR444a, 9 variants for miR444b, 13 variants
for miR444c, 8 variants for miR444d, 2 variants for miR444e and
2 variants for miR444f.

Classifying all the 318 generated in silica splice variants using
miR-abela, results in 37 candidate pre-miRNAs (Table 1 and
Supplementary Table S1). When neglecting variants, which differ
slightly in their splice sites and/or in their starting or ending positions
in the genome, a set of 16 candidate pre-miRNAs remains. This
set includes all six miR444-family members and 10 additional,
unknown loci which are neither present in miRBase nor show
similarity to any other mature miRNA sequence. Hence, miR-abela
is able to correctly classify the miR444-family members as pre-
miRNAs, even if the 5’ and/or 3’ ends of the putative pre-miRNA
sequences differ slightly from the veriﬁed sequences.

When using the mRNAs of 0sMADS27, 0sMADS5 7 and
0sMADS6I as input sequences for Phase 2 of our method, sets of
17, 25 and 34 candidate pre-miRNAs, respectively, are generated
(Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). As in the case of 0sMADS23,
also for 0sMADS5 7 all six miR444-family members are identiﬁed

by our method, which is in accordance with previous predictions
(Lu et al., 2008). For 0sMADS27, miR444e is the only miR444-
farnily member which is not detected by our method. 0sMADS27
was predicted to be regulated by all six miR444-family members
(Lu et al., 2008). However, this regulation has not been veriﬁed
yet and might not occur in viva. 0sMADS6I was predicted to be
only regulated by miR444b and miR444c (Lu et al., 2008). With
our method, additionally miR444a and miR444d are identiﬁed as
candidate pre-miRNAs when using the mRNA of 0sMADS6I as
input sequence. Both, miR444a and miR444d contain sequences
that are highly complementary to the mRNA of 0sMADS6I, with
only three mismatches, and thus might indeed regulate 0sMADS6I.
In accordance with the predictions (Lu et al., 2008), miR444e and
miR444f are not identiﬁed by our method when using the mRNA of
0sMADS6I as input.

For each candidate pre-miRNA, we retrieved the e-value of the
GU-BLAST search identifying the corresponding complementary
sequence pair using the target mRNA as input. This e-value is
very low, <0.01, for all miR444-family members (Supplementary
Table S1). Hence, we introduced a ranking based on this e-value
representing the complementarity of the candidate pre-miRNA to
the target mRNA. We suggest that candidate pre-miRNAs having
an accordant e-value of less than 1 could be considered as high
priority candidates.

Due to the complementarity of the two strands of DNA and the
complementarity within pre-miRNAs (resulting in the typical stem—
loop structure which is crucial for their recognition), it is not always
possible to distinguish from which strand of DNA a miRNA gene is
transcribed (Adai et al., 2005; Lai et al., 2003; Sandmann and Cohen,
2007). Nevertheless, our method is able to identify the coding strand
of the genes of miR444a, miR444b, miR444e and miR444f. For
miR444c and miR444d, our method predicts a candidate pre-miRNA
for both strands. In these cases, promoter detection methods (Abeel
et al., 2009; Zhou,X. et al., 2007) might help to determine from
which strand the miRNA gene is actually transcribed.

In total, SplamiR detects 79 candidate pre-miRNAs for the four
mRNAs of 0sMADS23, 0sMADS27, 0sMADS5 7 and 0sMADS6I .
The largest number of candidate pre-miRNAs is identiﬁed when
using the mRNA of 0sMADS6I as input (34 candidate pre-miRNAs,
including four miR444-family members, Table 1 and Supplementary
Table S 1). Of the 79 candidate pre-miRNAs, six represent members
of the miR444 family of miRNAs while some of the remaining 73
candidate pre-miRNAs might be false positive results. To reduce
the number of remaining candidate pre-miRNAs, their pre-miRNA
structures can be studied in more detail to reveal violations of
properties that are not checked by miR-abela, like mismatches
between the mature miRNA and the target mRNA surrounding the
assumed site of mRNA cleavage (Schwab et al., 2005).

3.4 Predictions of miRNAs in maize

For maize, the expression of one member of the miR444 family has
been veriﬁed by RNA gel blots (Lu et al., 2008; Sunkar et al., 2005).
A recent study on the characterization of miRNA genes in the maize
genome failed to identify the genomic locus encoding this miR444
due to the presence of a large intron in the priU-miRNA (Zhang
et al., 2009).

To ﬁnd genes encoding miR444-family members, we employed
our method to the 10 chromosomes of maize. SplamiR detects a total

Mismatch

Fig. 3. Alignment of an EST of the miR444-family member in maize and the two candidate pre-miRNAs identiﬁed by SplamiR. The candidate pre-miRNA
found on chromosome 2 has an identical sequence compared with the EST. while the candidate pre-miRNA found on chromosome 5 has 13 mismatches and
two deletions (all differences are indicated by X) compared with the EST sequence in the alignable region.

of 4495 838 complementary sequence pairs in the maize genome.
Using the mRNA of the maize gene ZmMADS2, which is closely
related to the rice target genes considered above (Arora et al., 2007;
Becker and Theissen, 2003; Schreiber et al., 2004), we identiﬁed 14
candidate pre-miRNAs (Supplementary Table S1). Considering the
comparatively large genome size of maize (Schnable et al., 2009),
this represents a reasonably low number of candidate pre-miRNAs.
None of the candidate pre-miRNAs are listed in miRBase. Two of
the 14 candidate pre-miRNAs exhibit sequence similarity to the
pre-miR444 sequences from rice. The remaining 12 candidate pre-
miRNAs do not show similarity to any known pre-miRNA. A more
detailed comparison revealed identity between partial sequences of
two of the candidate pre-miRNAs and the mature miRNA sequences
of miR444b and miR444c of rice. These two candidate pre-miRNAs
are encoded by genes which are located on the maize chromosomes
2 and 5, respectively.

An EST sequence of the previously veriﬁed miR444 from maize
(Lu et al., 2008; Sunkar et al., 2005) was retrieved from GenBank
(Benson et al., 2010). Both candidate pre-miRNAs are shorter than,
but otherwise nearly identical to this EST sequence (Fig. 3). The
candidate pre-miRNA on chromosome 2 is identical to the EST
sequence in the alignable region. Thus, we identiﬁed the genomic
location of the gene encoding the known miR444-family member
in maize. Analysis of the genomic locus revealed that the gene
contains an intron with a length of 3397 nt. A gene with EST
support (GRMZM2G032942) is annotated at this genomic locus.
The position of the intron of the priU-miRNA as predicted by our
method is in accordance with an intron of the annotated gene.
Comparison of the candidate pre-miRNA on chromosome 5 with
the EST sequence reveals only 13 mismatches and two deletions
in the alignable region (Fig. 3). Consequently, this candidate pre-
miRNA likely represents a previously undiscovered member of the
miR444 family in maize. Also in this case, a gene with EST support
(GRMZM2G016651) is annotated in the corresponding genomic
region. The priU-miRNA contains an intron with a length of 7661 nt,
consistent with the annotated gene. The high complementarity of
parts of the candidate pre-miRNAs to the potential target mRNA
ZmMADS2 strongly suggests regulation of ZmMADS2 by these
candidate pre-miRNAs.

The remaining 12 candidate pre-miRNAs do not exhibit
convincing similarity to known pre-miRNAs and thus await
veriﬁcation.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We presented SplamiR, the ﬁrst method for the prediction of spliced
miRNAs in plants. Our method predicts sequences and structures of
pre-miRNAs. SplamiR has a modular structure which provides great
ﬂexibility as individual modules can be replaced by more speciﬁc
ones as soon as these become available.

We demonstrated that SplamiR is able to detect all members of
the miR444 family of miRNAs in rice, a family of miRNAs for
which the characteristic stem—loop structure cannot be predicted
on genomic sequence and which has hence only been identiﬁed
experimentally. Furthermore, using SplamiR, we have detected a
previously unidentiﬁed member of the miR444 family in maize.

Our method will help to determine whether an mRNA of interest
is regulated by a miRNA and will reveal more of these key regulators
which have, so far, escaped identiﬁcation.

Abstract

Motivation: The data gathered by the Pan—Cancer initiative has created an unprecedented oppor—
tunity for illuminating common features across different cancer types. However, separating tissue—
specific features from across cancer signatures has proven to be challenging. One of the often—
observed properties of the mutational landscape of cancer is the mutual exclusivity of cancer driv—
ing mutations. Even though studies based on individual cancer types suggested that mutually ex—
clusive pairs often share the same functional pathway, the relationship between across cancer mu—
tual exclusivity and functional connectivity has not been previously investigated.

Results: We introduce a classification of mutual exclusivity into three basic classes: within tissue
type exclusivity, across tissue type exclusivity and between tissue type exclusivity. We then com—
bined across—cancer mutual exclusivity with interactions data to uncover pan—cancer dysregulated
pathways. Our new method, Mutual Exclusivity Module Cover (MEMCover) not only identified pre—
viously known Pan—Cancer dysregulated subnetworks but also novel subnetworks whose across
cancer role has not been appreciated well before. In addition, we demonstrate the existence of mu—
tual exclusivity hubs, putatively corresponding to cancer drivers with strong growth advantages.
Finally, we show that while mutually exclusive pairs within or across cancer types are predomin—
antly functionally interacting, the pairs in between cancer mutual exclusivity class are more often
disconnected in functional networks.

1 Introduction

The Pan—Cancer initiative surveyed genetic and epigenetic aberrations
in cancer samples from thousands of cancer patients over 12 cancer
types (Cancer Genome Atlas Research at 111., 2013). This data opened
the door to a systematic examination of the similarities and differences
among multiple cancer types. However, integrative analysis for sub—
type classifications from five ‘omics’ platforms revealed that ‘cell—of—
origin’ features dominate the molecular taxonomy of diverse tumor
types rather than discovering common features across tissue types.
Although such an outcome may be partly due to the tissue specificity
of some cancer driver genes and pathways, it can also be attributed to
the lack of power to untangle mixed signals of cell—type—specific and
cancer—specific features (Cancer Genome Atlas Research at 111., 2013).

Despite these strong tissue—specific signals, it has also become
evident that many mutated genes, and even whole dysregulated sub—
networks, are shared by multiple cancer types (Lawrence et (11.,
2014; Leiserson et (11., 2013, 2014). Pathway—centric methods have
emerged as a key approach to empower studies of complex diseases
with heterogeneous signals by focusing on the genetic activities on
the level of biological pathways (subnetworks) rather than individ—
ual genes. Several computational methods have been developed to
utilize genotypic data for the identification of mutated subnetworks
(Cho et (11., 2012; Vandin et (11., 2011, 2012a, b) and stratification
of cancer subtypes (Hofree et (11., 2013).

One of the often—observed properties of the mutational landscape
of cancer is the mutual exclusivity of cancer driving mutations

(Thomas et al., 2007). Mutually exclusive mutations observed among
genes in the same functional pathway prompted the development of
computational methods that utilize mutual exclusivity in the context
of identifying pathways dysregulated in cancer as well as for the path—
way independent identification of mutually exclusive cancer drivers
(Ciriello et al., 2012, 2013, Leiserson et al., 2013; Szczurek and
Beerenwinkel, 2014; Vandin et al., 2012a, b). However, the sets of
mutually exclusive drivers previously obtained in Pan—Cancer analysis
(Kandoth et al., 2013; Szczurek and Beerenwinkel, 2014) predomin—
antly contain tissue type—specific genes and do not necessarily share
common pathways, indicating that the previous definition of mutual
exclusivity is not sufficient in Pan—Cancer analysis and it is necessary
to recognize different mutual exclusivity classes.

To this end, we started by classifying mutual exclusivity
patterns into three basic classes: within tissue type exclusivity (mutual
exclusivity observed only in one cancer type), across tissue type exclu—
sivity (mutual exclusivity common to several tissue types), and be—
tween tissue type exclusivity (mutual exclusivity between putative
tissue—specific drivers). We developed statistical tests that allow us to
identify the membership of gene sets to these mutual exclusivity
classes. We then aimed to use the principle of mutual exclusivity for
identification of subnetworks dysregulated across multiple cancer
types. To identify Pan—Cancer dysregulated modules, we utilized the
across cancer mutual exclusivity measure jointly with the interaction
data from a network. Interestingly, we found that functionally inter—
acting gene pairs are more likely to be involved in across tissue type
mutual exclusivity while between type exclusivity is more often
observed in gene pairs that are not functionally related.

Adapting the Module Cover approach (Kim et al., 2013), we un—
covered subnetvvorks that are dysregualted in multiple cancer types.
Module Cover is an extension of the classical Multi—Set Cover ap—
proach, utilized before to find disease marker genes for highly hetero—
geneous genomic data, to a network setting. This is an optimization
technique that is particularly suitable in the context of heterogonous
data. The approach essentially aims to identify a set of dysregulated
subnetworks so that a desired subnetwork score is optimized, while at
the same time, ensuring that altered genes from different cancer sam—
ples are present in the union of the selected subnetworks. Our pro—
posed algorithm, Mutual Exclusivity Module Cover (MEMCover),
uses the module cover strategy to combine mutual exclusivity feature
with functional interactions and genomic aberration data from indi—
vidual Pan—Cancer cases to uncover Pan—Cancer dysregulated subnet—
works. Unlike previous approaches for finding a set of genetic
aberrations exclusive between all pairs, MEMCover does not neces—
sarily seek to identify subnetworks with complete exclusivity among
the genes, (Leiserson et al., 2013; Szczurek and Beerenwinkel, 2014;
Vandin et al., 2012a, b) but utilizes pairwise mutual exclusivity to
complement interaction data for a better identification of subnet—
works dysregulated in Pan—Cancer samples.

When applied to Pan—Cancer data, MEMCover identified a large
number of subnetworks dysregulated across many cancer types. We
found that many of the identified subnetworks are linked to cancer—
related pathways, overlapping with all but one subnetwork with at
least 10% coverage recently identified by HotNet2 in Pan—Caner
analyses (Leiserson et al., 2014) despite the fact that MEMCover is
based on completely different principle from HotNet2. We also
identified subnetworks whose role across cancer types has not been
appreciated previously.

Finally, our analysis also suggests the existence of mutual exclu—
sivity hubs—genes whose genetic aberrations are mutually exclusive
with aberrations in a large number of other genes, both connected
and not connected in the network, indicating that these mutual

exclusivity hubs may correspond to cancer driver genes that have
particularly strong growth advantages.

2 Classification of mutual exclusivity in
pan-cancer

2.1 Mutual exclusivity classes

Although mutually exclusive mutations are often observed in cancer
samples, the underlying cause of mutual exclusivity is not always
clear and might vary depending on the context. Gene pairs with mu—
tually exclusive aberrations might correspond to different drivers
dysregulating the same pathway or might be tissue—specific cancer
drivers dysregulating completely different pathways. A mutually ex—
clusive pair can also be specific in only one tissue type or might be
common to multiple cancer types. Observing different mutual exclu—
sive patterns, we start by classifying mutual exclusivity into the fol—
lowing classes (Fig. 1):

1. Mutual Exclusivity Within a cancer type (WITTHIN_ME):
mutual exclusivity is observed within only one individual tissue
type. For example, the RB1 and EGFR pair has a signiﬁcant
WI THIN_ME relationship in GBM as shown in Figure 1A.

2. Mutual Exclusivity Between cancer types (BETWEEN_ME): mu—
tual exclusivity is observed due to different tissue speciﬁcity of a
given pair of genetic aberrations. Figure 1B shows an example of
BETWEEN_ME, where von Hippel—Lindau (VHL) mutation is
speciﬁc for KIRC, APC is enriched in CRC and EGFR in GBM.

3. Mutual Exclusivity Across multiple cancer types
(ACROSS_ME): mutual exclusivity is observed in more than
one tissue types. It may mean that mutual exclusivity is statistic—
ally signiﬁcant in two or more cancer types or that the statistical
signiﬁcance is increased when considering multiple cancer types
relative to within cancer type exclusivity. Figure 1C and D are
two examples of ACROSS_ME class.

It is important to keep in mind that this classification is data de—
pendent, and expanding the dataset might change membership in some
classes. In particular, ACROSS_ME pairs that are not detected as
WITHIN_ME in the individual tissues (e.g. ARID1B, KRAS in Fig. 1D)
are likely to be detected as such if a larger sample size was available.

2.2 Estimating mutual exclusivity classes

Permutation test is a commonly used technique to estimate mutual
exclusivity in cancer mutation profiles (Ciriello et al., 2013; Vandin
et al., 2012a, b). In the approach, the null model is created by per—
muting a given mutation profile while preserving the mutation rates
of individual genes and samples. If the mutations of a pair of genes
are mutually exclusive, they will collectively cover more samples
than expected by chance. The significance of mutual exclusivity is
measured by counting the number of random instances in which
more samples are covered than in the original mutation profile. We
extended the permutation technique to estimate each of the Pan—can—
cer ME classes defined in Section 2.1. We first describe the tests and
then explain how they are used to assess the exclusivity classes of
gene pairs.

1. Type Separate Permutation Test of an Individual Tissue Type
(TS_test): Mutual Exclusivity within a cancer type is estimated
separately by permuting mutation proﬁles independently for
each cancer type. To preserve the mutation rates of each gene
and each sample, in each iteration, two (gene, sample) pairs are
randomly chosen and swapped. A permuted mutation proﬁle is

coding of cancer types) and each row below the top bar indicates the presence or the absence of alteration of a given gene in the corresponding cancer samples.
The insets show the zoom-in views for the set of patients with alterations in at least one gene. (A) R81 and EGFR show WITHINiME pattern with respect to GBM.
While, in the inset, we can see that the exclusivity may also be present in other cancer types it is not statistically significant (compare the width of the altered sam-
ples to the width for all samples in the top bar) (B) VHL, APC and EGFR show BETWEENiME pattern. VHL mutation is specific for KIRC, APC is enriched in CRC
and EGFR in GBM. (C) and (D) show the examples of ACROSS,ME. The CDKNZA and RB1genes shown in panel C also satisfy WlTHlNiME with respect to GBM
and LUSC while the ARlDiB, KRAS pair shown in panel D is not significant in any Tsitest of individual cancer type separately

obtained after a certain number of iterations. For a gene g, let
COVERC(g) be the set of samples in cancer type C with gene g
mutated. Given a set of genes A, COVERC(A) :Ug ,-,, A
COVERC(g). The signiﬁcance of ME is estimated by counting
the number of random instances in which )COVERC(A)) is
bigger than the size in the original mutation proﬁle. The size of
COVERC(A) is likely to be bigger than expected if the mutations
of the genes in A are mutually exclusive (Ciriello et al., 2013;
Vandin et al., 2012a). In Figure 2A, gene 1 and gene 2 are mutu—
ally exclusive and the size of the cover in the original mutation is
bigger than the permutated instances.

2. Type Restricted Permutation Test wit/7 All Pan Cancer Samples
(TR_test): In this test, we run permutation for each cancer
separately as in the TS_test and compute the normalized sum
of cover size, NCOVER(A):ZC NCOVERC(A) where
NCOVERC(A) : (COVERC(A))/)C) and (C) is the number of
samples in cancer type C. The cover size is divided by (C) to re—
move the impact of different sample sizes of cancer types. The
empirical P—value is computed based on the rank of
N COVER(A). Figure 2B gives an illustration of TR test, where
the signiﬁcance of ME is increased by combining the samples
from cancer type A and B. Note that because the mutations are
permuted separately for each type, the mutations from different
cancer types will never be swapped with each other, which pre—
vents a pair of genes whose mutations are speciﬁc to two differ—
ent cancer types (i.e. BETWEEN_ME class) from being assigned
a low P—value (the second panel in Fig. 2C)

3. Type Oblivious Permutation Test wit/7 All Pan Samples (TO_test):
We applied the permutation test described in TS_test to all Pan—
Cancer samples and estimate the signiﬁcance of the mutual exclu—
sivity. That is, we considered all cancer samples and repeatedly
performed swapping of two randomly selected (gene, sample)
pairs regardless of their cancer types. The bottom panel in Figure
2C shows an illustration of T0 test. The mutations are speciﬁc to
two different cancer types and the mutual exclusivity may be sig—
niﬁcant in TO test but not in TR_test.

The gene pairs passing TS_test for exactly one tissue type with a
more significant P—value than in TR_test are naturally assigned to
the WIHTIN_ME class. The ACROSS_ME class contains the gene

pairs that pass TS_test for more than one tissue or pass TR_test
(with a more significant P—value than in TS_test). Note that by sum—
ming up the size of covers across all cancer types, the statistically
power to identify ME patterns existing in multiple cancer types can
be increased, allowing for detecting across—cancer mutual exclusivity
that might not be detected when each tissue type is considered
individually.

Finally, we assign a pair to the BETWEEN_ME class if the pair
pass TO_test but none of the other tests. Indeed, TO_test can poten—
tially capture mutually exclusive pairs of all three types. However,
in the case where the overall mutation rates of a given set of genes
are low and the mutations are associated with only a few cancer
types, permuting samples across cancer types may wipe out existing
ME patterns especially for WITHIN_ME and ACROSS ME classes.
Thus, TS_test and TR_test are more accurate for the purpose of de—
tecting these two classes, whereas TO_test is used to capture gene
sets in the BETWEEN_ME class provided that other classes of ME
are not present. We confirmed the correctness of this assignment in
the discussion below.

2.3 ME classes of interacting gene pairs

Dataset: We obtained Pan—Cancer mutation profiles by collecting
somatic mutation and Copy Number Variation (CNV) data for a set
of 11 different types (COAD and READ are combined into one
type) of cancers from TCGA with total of 3182 cancer samples. We
then created 10000 randomly permuted profiles using both type—
separate and type—oblivious permutations. Note that TS and TR
tests use the same permutation method by permuting samples inde—
pendently in each cancer type but differ in the way to compute P—
values. For each permutation instance, we performed edge swapping
1000"r
gested in the previous study (Milo et al., 2003).

As we focus on finding cancer drivers belonging to the same
pathways and their mutual exclusivity patterns, we utilized a func—
tional interaction network, HumanNet downloaded from http://
www.functionalnet.org/humannet/ and performed the ME test to
classify the interacting pairs into different ME classes. HumanNet is
a functional gene network, including 18714 validated protein—
encoding genes of Homo Sapiens and 474 913 interactions. The

stances cover less samples than the original mutation profile, indicating the significance of mutual exclusivity (B) TR test: when two cancer types are considered
together, gene 1 and gene 2 are mutually exclusive in both cancer types but they may not be statistically significant when tested separately in each cancer type

network is significantly dense compared with other available human
interaction networks as the network is constructed by a Bayesian in—
tegration of 21 different types of ‘omics’ data including expression
profiles, protein interactions, genetic interactions etc. We tested
with another interaction network and found similar results (Section
3.3 and Supplementary Material). We also tested non—interacting
pairs and discuss the results in Section 3.3.

Among more than 450K pairs we tested, there are over 3000
pairs of genes that are significant in the TO_test (P < 0.01) but none
in other tests. The gene pairs in the category are most likely to have
BETWEEN_ME relationships and each gene has its distinct tissue
specificity. To confirm that these genes indeed have tissue specificity,
we performed a hypergeometric test for each cancer type and exam—
ined if the gene is significantly tissue specific, i.e., has significantly
more (or less) mutated samples in a given cancer type (P—value
cutoff< 0.01). For example, VHL mutation is significantly overre—
presented in KIRC and underrepresented in all other cancer types.
Mutually exclusive tissue specificity for a pair of genes is subse—
quently tested by checking if there is at least one cancer type in which
the mutation of one gene is overrepresented and the other is underre—
presented (or vice versa). We found that for the pairs that were sig—
nificant only in the TO_TEST, 73% of the interactions (2405 out of
3292 pairs) have mutually exclusive tissue specificity and thus con—
firmed that they can be properly assigned to the BETWEEN_ME
class while for the interactions in other categories, only 29% of them
(1753 out of 5986 pairs) have mutually exclusive tissue specificity.

We also note that 135 interactions were found to be significant
in more than one cancer types in TS-test (P < 0.01) and all but 15 of
those interactions were also captured by TR_test, suggesting
TR_test captures most of ACROSS_ME pairs. In addition, there are
almost 4000 pairs that are significant in the TR_test but none in the
TS_test, demonstrating the increased power of the TR_test by com—
bining samples from multiple tissue types.

2.4 ACROSS_ME pairs are clustered
We conjectured that if the existence of ACROSS_ME pairs is due to
the fact that the corresponding genes belong to the same pathways,

the ACROSS_ME pairs should be close to each other in an interaction
network. To examine if ME edges are more clustered than expected,
we selected 4722 edges with empirical P—value < 0.01 (TR_TEST) and
constructed a subnetwork consisting of those selected edges. The net—
work included 217 connected components with only 160 edges
(~3%) not adjacent to other ME edges. We also created 100 random
subnetworks using a random sampling of the same number of edges
(a degree preserving permutation test via edge shufﬂing is not applic—
able in this case because ME scores are tied with gene pairs and ori—
ginal ME scores cannot be preserved after shufﬂing edges) and found
that the random networks have an average of over 853 connected
components with more than 603 single edges on average. The ME
subnetwork also has a clustering coefficient of 0.015, confirming it is
more clustered than expected (empirical P—value < 0.01). We note
that nodes with high degree in HumanNet are more likely to have ME
edges (Spearman Correlation Coefficient: 0.41) and the clustering of
ME edges can be due to the existence of those hubs. However, we
found that random subnetworks of the same size have even higher
correlation in degree distributions (the Average Spearman Correlation
Coefficient: 0.59) i.e., hubs are more likely to be selected in random
sampling but the random networks are not as clustered as the ME net—
work. This suggests that ME edges are clearly not randomly placed in
the network but there may be some nodes incident to many ME edges,
namely ME hubs. For example, KRAS and TP53 have as many as 236
and 141 ACROSS_ME edges, respectively. ME hubs may not neces—
sarily be the nodes with the highest degree in the original network.
We discuss ME hubs in more detail below (Section 3.3). The ME de—
gree of a node (the number of ME edges incident to the node) also has
a slight correlation with the number samples for which the gene is
altered (Spearman Correlation Coefficient : 0.19).

3 Finding pan-cancer dysregulaed modules using
functional network and mutual exclusivity

3.1 The MEMCover algorithm
Motivated by the fact that ME edges are more clustered than ex—
pected, in the next step we aim to find a set of gene modules where

genes in the same module are mutually exclusive and/or functionally
related. We adapted the Module Cover algorithm, which was de—
veloped to identify a set of disease signature modules and success—
fully uncovered several important cancer related subnetvvorks in
GBM and Ovarian Cancer samples (Kim et al., 2013). In the
Module Cover algorithm, genes are greedily selected to cover disease
samples while simultaneously creating modules of ‘closely related’
genes. In MEMCover, we improved the method by utilizing
ACROSS_ME levels obtained in the previous section when we com—
pute the weights of edges.

Like Module Cover, MEMCover finds a set of modules with the
minimum total cost while covering all disease samples at least [2
times. We say that a gene covers a sample [cover(c, g): 1] if the
gene is altered in the sample. Because we assume that each cancer
case has more than one driver gene, we require that each sample has
to be covered at least [2 times where k is the input parameter of algo—
rithm (see parameter selection in Supplementary Material).
Formally, the goal is to find a minimum cost set of modules
(subnetworks) that covers all disease cases at least [2 times. In other
words, we search for a module set S’ : {M1, M2,  , Mt} that
minimizes ZMiES, Cost(M,-) while for each disease sample c,
ZMiES, EggM-covedc7 g)2k. Module cost Cost(M) is computed
based on the edge weights inside module M as follows:

Cost(M) : IMI — Z avg_weight(x) (1)
x E M

where avg_weight(x) : ZyEM\{x}u/(x,  — 1). The module
cost decreases as the average weight inside module increases, which
ensures a selection of subnetworks with heavy weight edges. We de—
fine edge weight (—1 S w(x, y) S 1) based on the confidence score
in HumanNet and its ACROSS_ME score. We describe the choice
of edge weights in Section 3.2 and the parameter selection section in
the Supplementary Material in more detail.

Because the optimization problem defined above is NP—hard,
MEMCover greedily selects genes and creates modules: in each iter—
ation, we greedily choose a gene with minimum IC(g)/Benefit(g).
Benefit(g) is defined to be the number of samples covered by a gene
g which are not yet covered [2 times. The increase in the cost when
adding a gene g depends on whether the gene creates a separate
module by itself or is added to an existing module. The cost is 1 if
it creates a separate module and for the latter case (added to
an existing module), the cost is defined as I C(g) : minM,-e Hg)
(Cost(MiLJ{g})—Cost(M,))), where P(g) is the subset of existing
modules connected to g. The gene is added in a way that it incurs
the minimum increased cost. If the minimum cost of gene g is
obtained when gene g is added to an existing module M, the module
is updated accordingly otherwise a new module {g} is created. We
repeat this until we cover all samples by the required number of
times.

3.1.1 Post-processing

In the post—processing in MEMCover, we refined the modules by (i)
merging two modules if the average edge weight between them is
positive, (ii) allowing a gene to be added to more than one module if
the average edge weight between the gene and a module is positive.

i. Merging modules: we consider all possible pairs of selected
modules and greedily merge two modules if the average weight
between module pairs is positive. More speciﬁcally, in each iter—
ation, we take the module pair with the heaviest average weight
between the two modules and repeatedly merge them until there
is no such pair.

ii. Overlapping modules: so far a gene can belong to only one mod—
ule. In the overlapping phase, we consider every pair of a se—
lected gene and a module (which does not already include the
gene) and check if the average weight between the gene and the
module is positive. As in the merging step, we start overlapping
with the highest weight pairs ﬁrst until there is no pair satisfying
the condition.

3.2 ME scores help finding cancer signature modules
We utilize the CNV and mutation data for the same 3182 Pan—
Cancer samples described in Section 2 and performed MEMCover.
A simple extension of the MEMCover method allows us to assign a
different coverage rate for different type of alterations. Because som—
atic mutations are relatively rare and accurate compared to CNV
data (Hofree et al., 2013), we weight the coverage rate higher for
somatic mutations than CNV. Among different parameters, we
chose [2 : 15 and the coverage rate of mutations (mr) : 3 [i.e. cov—
er(c, g): 3 ifg has mutation and cover(c, g): 1 ifg has CNV]. The
parameters result in selecting 5—15 covering alterations for each can—
cer sample, a number roughly consistent with the expected number
of cancer drivers. See Supplementary Materials B for further discus—
sion on the parameter selection.

The edge weight uI(e) is defined for each interaction e in
HumanNet to be (hn(e) +me(e))/2—f(0), where hn(e) (0 < hn(e) g 1)
is the normalized HumanNet confidence score and me(e) is the nor—
malized —log(P—value) in TR_test (both values are normalized by
dividing by the maximum of each). f( 0) is a parameter that we can
use to control the trade—off between the number of modules and the
average weights within each module; that is to determine how low
the two scores (hn(e) and me(e)) are allowed to include a gene in a
module instead of creating a separate module. We define 0 to be the
percentage of edges whose weights remain positive and f(0) is the
corresponding weight threshold (when edges are sorted by their un—
adjusted weights). Recall that by the definition of the module cost in
(1), positive edge weights reduce the module cost and therefore, the
bigger 0 is [and the less f(0)], the more edges have positive scores
and MEMCover will select bigger modules in general. To compare
the impact of combining mutual exclusivity scores in the edge
weights, we also ran the algorithm with HumanNet—only weight
scheme where uI(e) : hn(e)—f(0).

To examine the quality of modules, we utilized a set of 138
known cancer driver genes in (Vogelstein et al., 2013), and checked
how many known cancer drivers were identified by MEMCover.
Although varying parameters gives different results in terms of the
number of selected genes, the number of selected drivers, etc., we
found that combining mutual exclusivity scores into edge weights
consistently improves the quality of modules as measured by iden—
tifying more known cancer drivers while selecting a less number of
candidate genes, thus having a high percentage of known cancer
drivers (Fig. 3). In particular, we ran MEMCover with varying 0’s in
the range of 20, 30, 40 and 50% of the top weighted edges and
found that 0:40% finds the highest number and percentage of

modules covered at least 5% of samples and 62 modules provide
coverage ~10%. These statistics are based on the modules before
the post—processing extension to allow overlaps. After the overlap
allowing module extension, ~10% of genes (86) belong to more
than one module while KRAS, TP53, EGFR, ERBB2, CTNNB1,
PPM1L, PRKACA belong to more than five modules. A representa—
tive subset of modules is shown in Figure 6 and the full list of mod—
ules is provided in Supplementary Materials.

3.3.2 Mutual exclusivity patterns in selected modules

The selection of modules in MEMCover is guided by not mutual ex—
clusivity only but also HumanNet connectivity and sample coverage.
Thus modules uncovered by MEMCover are not necessarily
required to contain mutually exclusive pairs. Indeed, as illustrated in
Figure 6, we observed modules with robust pairwise exclusivity pre—
sent between many different pairs, modules with mutual exclusivity
converging to only one ‘hub’ gene, modules with mutual exclusivity
significant in ACROSS_ME (but not WITHIN_ME), and modules
with no significant mutual exclusivity.

3.3.3 Mutual exclusivity hubs

Modules with mutual exclusivity involving one particular gene
strongly suggest the existence of ACROSS_ME/WITHIN_ME hubs.
To confirm this, we examined the distribution of the number of ME
partners among all the genes selected by MEMCover (Fig. 4). We
checked all pairs for their mutual exclusivity regardless of their con—
nectivity in HumanNet and chose the partner for which P—
value < 0.01 in TR or TS test and where the P—value in TR/TS_test is
more significant than in TO_test). Indeed, such Mutual Exclusivity
huihs (ME huhs) can be clearly identified (with KRAS, TP53,
PIK3CA, CTNNB1, DVL3, GRB7, CT CF at the top of the list, see
the Supplementary Table for the extended list). Note that Mutual
Exclusivity hub partners are not necessarily HumanNet neighbors.
This suggests that ME huhs are likely to have more significant
growth advantages than other cancer driver genes. We found that
the ME degrees in known driver genes are significantly higher com—
pared with the ME degrees in other genes (P—value < 1073, Mann—
Whitney U test).

3.3.4 Non-interacting pairs are enriched with BETWEEN_ME class
The existence of ME hubs calls for re—examining the assumption
that mutual exclusivity occurs predominantly between drivers from
the same pathway. Towards this end we divided all possible pairs of
genes selected by MEMCover into two groups: those that are con—
nected in HumanNet and those that are not. We then considered the
distribution of mutual exclusivity classes within each of these two

groups. We found that despite the existence of ME hubs whose in—
ﬂuence might extend beyond one pathway, the ACROSS_ME class
is enriched for HumanNet neighbors while non—HumanNet pairs
show a higher percentage of BETWEEN_ME pairs (Fig. 5A).
Interestingly, there is only one BETWEEN_ME edge in our top
modules (modules with 10% or better coverage)—the edge between
VHL and CDKN2A in the module related to the RB1/MDM2 path—
way. Although these two genes are connected in HumanNet, the
functional relation between them is not obvious. VHL gene (VHL
tumor suppressor, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) is the primary gene
for the common, non—hereditary form of clear cell kidney cancer
(Cancer Genome Atlas Research, 2013) while CDKN2A and RB1
are hallmarks of lung squamous cell carcinoma (Cancer Genome
Atlas Research, 2012) and glioblastoma (Cancer Genome Atlas
Research, 2008). Thus, while CDKN2A and RB1 are mutually ex—
clusive within both cancer types, VHL and CDKN2A show between
type exclusivity only. We have also tested the hypothesis with an—
other network. The result with a PPI network (HINT+) (Das and
Yu, 2012; Leiserson et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2011) was consistent
with the one with HumanNet (Fig. 5A) that across—cancer and
within cancer mutually exclusive pairs are enriched among pairs of
interacting genes while between—cancer exclusivities are enriched for
non—interacting gene pairs (Supplementary Material C for more dis—
cussion). Interestingly, we found that the physical network includes
a bigger proportion of within cancer exclusivity than the functional
interaction network does, which suggests that the mutations within
the same protein complex are likely to be cancer drivers for the same
t1ssue.

3.4 MEMCover identifies new pan—cancer dysregulated
subnetworks as well as known subnetworks

Due to their connectivity in HumanNet, modules uncovered by
MEMCover include genes from specific molecular pathways/com—
plexes and their regulators (Fig. 6). Despite very different algorith—
mic approach, differences in underlying interaction network, and
different search criteria, all but one (ASCOM complex) of the six
subnetworks with 10% or more coverage and most of subnetworks
with coverage 2—10% reported with HotNet2 (Leiserson et al.,
2014) overlap with our pathways. Because MEMCover is opti—
mized, among others things, to find subnetworks with high coverage
it found nearly all subnetworks with 10% or better coverage that
were reported in (Leiserson et al., 2014) and a large number of non—
reported subnetworks. Not surprisingly, our modules are not as
related to the sets of mutually exclusive Pan—Cancer genetic aberra—
tions identified in a recent study (Szczurek and Beerenwinkel, 2014),
in which they focused on the identification of exclusive cancer

drivers and zoomed on tissue type specific genes (for example VHL,
APC, EGFR analyzed in Fig 1B) rather than genes which share com—
mon pathways (See also Supplementary Table A3).

In addition to finding expected subnetworks, an interesting ex—
ample we found is the subnetwork containing splicing factor 3B pro—
tein complex (SF3B) together with the RBMX gene—a gene
implicated in tissue—specific regulation of gene transcription and al—
ternative splicing of several pre—mRNAs and the SRSF2 gene—an
(SR)—rich pre—mRNA splicing factors, which constitute part of the
spliceosome. Indeed, SF3B1 and SRSF2 have been recently found
to be significantly mutated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CMML) (Je et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011). Our analysis shows
that spliceosomal machinery is dysregulated across many cancer
types and displays ACROSS_ME exclusivity between SF3B and
SRSF2 genes.

As for the cohesin complex, this multi—subunit protein complex
plays an integral role in sister chromatid cohesion, DNA repair, and
meiosis. Proteins from this complex are known to positively regulate
the transcription of genes known to be dysregulated in cancer, such
as Runx1, Runx3 and Myc as reviewed in (Rhodes et al., 2011). In
addition, a recent study reported recurrent mutations and deletions
involving multiple components of the cohesin complex, including
STAG2, RAD21, SMC1A and SMC3, in different myeloid neo—
plasms (Kon et al., 2013).

Finally, in the case of calcium channel, there is evidence that the
ryanodine receptor 3 gene (RYR3), which encodes a large protein
that forms a calcium channel, is important for the growth, morph—
ology, and migration of breast cancer cells (Zhang et al., 201 1).

3.5 Comparison with alternative approaches

We compared our results with the pan—cancer subnetworks obtained
using HotNet2 (Leiserson et al., 2014). Different from our ap—
proach, the method is based on a heat diffusion method to identify
significantly mutated subnetworks and mutual exclusivity informa—
tion was not used in identifying the subnetworks. Leiserson et al. re—
ported that the results with two gene scoring schemes—frequency
and MutSig scores. Our results presented in Section 3.4 uses
frequency scores for cover rate. For comparison, we also ran
MEMCover using MutSig scores as gene cover rate (Fig. 5B). Note
that the number of genes selected is different depending on the meth—
ods and different parameters and that different networks have been
used. Here, we considered the genes selected by MEMCover in the
order in which they are added and counted the number of known
drivers in the selected subset of genes in each iteration. Our algo—
rithm consistently finds more known driver genes for the same num—
ber of selected genes compared with the set obtained by HotNet2.
We note that known drivers tend to have much higher MutSig
scores, and thus in the context of this comparison, the improvement
from using MutSig is expected. But using MutSig scores may reduce
the likelihood to find rare de novo cancer drivers as mentioned in
the article (Leiserson et al., 2014).

We also compared our results with the work related to mutual
exclusivity for Pan—Cancer (Kandoth et al., 2013; Szczurek and
Beerenwinkel, 2014). Their approaches differ from our work in that
the goal is to find a set of mutually exclusive genes regardless of their
interaction relationships. The outcomes of the algorithm include a
small number of modules (2—3 modules), resulting in 10—20 selected
genes in total, most of which are known drivers. As brieﬂy men—
tioned in Section 3.4, while it is true that the identified genes are mu—
tually exclusive in Pan—Cancer samples, we found that they
predominantly have BETWEEN_ME relationships (Supplementary
Fig. S3). In particular, the first Pan—Cancer ME set identified by
Dendrix (Kandoth et al., 2013) is mostly in BETWEEN_ME class,
consistent with their claim (Supplementary Fig. S3A). The second
module identified after removing tissue specificity contained more

module, we show the percentage of samples with alterations in the module and a pie chart with the distribution of the number of samples with at least one muta-
tion in each tissue type. For genes belonging to more than modules, they were counted according to module membership before extending them to allow over-
lap (therefore counted only once). Genes are not counted for the coverage and for the pie chart in a given subnetwork are marked as light gray boxes. Not
pictured modules include, among others, an additional subnetwork related to SWI/SNF [PBRM1, TOX2, SMARCA4], MHC class one members [HLA, HLB], exocyt-
osis related group [TRPC4, EXOC4, EXOC3, EXOC7, RALA]. The full list of subnetworks is provided in Supplementary Materials. The networks are created using

ACROSS_ME pairs, which confirms that our classification of ME
types is valid. MEMCover identifies all 10 genes in both modules.
Three modules of size five are identified by another study of mutual
exclusivity in Pan—Cancer (Szczurek and Beerenwinkel, 2014). The

modules include three meta—genes (a meta gene is a group of
genes which have the same mutation profiles) and the modules are
highly overlapped. We classified all pairs (with one representative
from each meta—gene) in the modules into different ME types

(Supplementary Fig. S3C—E), and found most of genes have
BETWEEN_ME relationships and very few ACROSS_ME or func—
tional interactions.

MeMo took an approach similar to ours, combining permuta—
tion based mutual exclusivity scores with interaction data (Ciriello
et al., 2013) and identified cancer related modules in GBM and
ovarian cancer. Pan—cancer analysis with MeMo is not available and
was reported as challenging to scale the algorithm for Pan—cancer
samples (Ciriello et al., 2013; Vandin et al., 2012a, b).

4 Discussion

In this study, we focused on systematic analysis of mutual exclusiv—
ity in the context of Pan—Cancer data and on the application of this
principle for guiding discovery of Pan—Cancer dysregulated subnet—
works. It has been previously proposed that mutually exclusive gen—
omic events are suggestive of a functional linkage of the altered
genes. Indeed, classifying mutual exclusivity into three types,
BETWEEN_ME (mutual exclusivity between putative tissue—spe—
cific drivers), WITHIN_ME (mutual exclusivity observable in one
cancer type), and ACROSS_ME (common mutual exclusivity across
multiple cancer types based on type restricted permutation test), we
found that BETWEEN_ME is more frequent among functionally
unrelated genes. Thus, our analysis demonstrates the importance of
distinguishing mutual exclusivity classes in Pan—Cancer analyses.

Interestingly, the distribution of the number of partners in
ACROSS_ME or WIHIN_ME relationships has a scale—free prop—
erty and revealed the existence of ME hubs. We conjecture that these
hubs have growth advantages that exceed the growth advantage
imposed by other drivers. If so, ranking according to the number of
non-BETWEEN_ME partners could be used to prioritize cancer
drivers.

Our results indicate that mutual exclusivity analysis provides
valuable information which, when utilized together with interaction
data, can guide a discovery of Pan—Cancer dysregulated subnet—
works. Indeed, we found that our new algorithm, MEMCover that
uses the module cover optimization strategy to combine functional
interactions, mutual exclusivity and genomic aberration frequency,
identified many Pan—Cancer dysregulated subnetworks including
previously known subnetworks as well as several new subnetworks
whose across—cancer role has not been well appreciated previously

Abstract

Motivation: Sumoylation is a post—translational modification (PTM) process, in which small
ubiquitin—related modifier (SUMO) is attaching by covalent bonds to substrate protein. It is critical
to many different biological processes such as replicating genome, expressing gene, localizing and
stabilizing proteins; unfortunately, it is also involved with many major disorders including
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Therefore, for both basic research and drug development, it
is important to identify the sumoylation sites in proteins.

Results: To address such a problem, we developed a predictor called pSumo—CD by incorporating
the sequence—coupled information into the general pseudo—amino acid composition (PseAAC) and
introducing the covariance discriminant (CD) algorithm, in which a bias—adjustment term, which
has the function to automatically adjust the errors caused by the bias due to the imbalance of train—
ing data, had been incorporated. Rigorous cross—validations indicated that the new predictor re—
markably outperformed the existing state—of—the—art prediction method for the same purpose.
Availability and implementation: For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user—
friendly web—server for pSumo—CD has been established at http://www.jci—bioinfo.cn/pSumo—CD, by
which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the complicated
mathematical equations involved.

such as claspin, whose binding function is sumoylation—dependent.
Many diseases and disorders, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
diseases, have been found to be closely related with sumoylation.
Therefore, identification of sumoylation sites in proteins is import—
ant not only for in—depth understanding many important biological
processes but also for developing effective drugs.

Identification of sumoylation sites with biological and chemical
approaches is more laborious and slow; particularly the sumoylation
is reversible and instable. With the avalanche of protein sequences
generated in the post—genomic era, it is highly demanded to develop
computational methods as a complimentary tool to the pure experi—
mental methods.

Actually, considerable efforts have been made in this regard,
including the method called SUMOsp developed by Xue et al.
(2006), the method SUMOsp2.0 by Ren et al. (2009) and the
method GPS—SUMO by Zhao et al. (2014); all of them were de—
veloped using the group—based phosphorylation scoring algorithm.
Meanwhile, based on support vector machine (SVM), the methods
SUMOPre and SUMOhydro were developed by Xu et al. (2008) and
Chen et al. (2012b), respectively. Very recently, based on the linear
discriminant analysis, Xu et al. (2016) proposed the method
SUMO_LDA. Each of these methods did make contribution in stim—
ulating the development of such an important area. Particularly, the
most recent method SUMO_LDA (Xu et (11., 2016), which was es—
tablished by combining three different types of sequence features
into the general pseudo—amino acid composition (PseAAC) (Chou,
2011), achieved quite decent success rates. In considering, however,
the topic’s importance and also the urgency of demanding more
powerful computational tools in this area, further efforts aiming at
prediction of protein sumoylation sites are definitely needed.

The present study was initiated in an attempt to develop a new
and more powerful predictor by (i) incorporating the vectorized
sequence—coupling model into the general form of pseudo amino
acid composition and (ii) installing the covariance discriminant op—
eration engine into the prediction system. Rigorous cross—validations
indicated that the new predictor significantly outperformed the
existing state—of—the—art predictor (Xu et (11., 2016) in both overall
accuracy (> 10%) and stability (>16%).

According to the Chou’s 5—step rule (Chou, 2011) and concurred
by many investigators in a series of recent publications (Chen et 111.,
20163, c; Jia et 111., 20163, b, c, d; Liu et 111., 20163, b, d, e; Qiu et 111.,
20163; Xiao et (11., 2016) for developing a new prediction method
that can be widely used by broad users, we should consider the fol—
lowing five points: (i) a good benchmark dataset used to train or test
the new model; (ii) an effective mathematical formulation to represent
the statistical samples concerned; (iii) a powerful algorithm to operate
the calculation; (iv) a compelling demonstration to show its prediction
quality being improved over the existing counterparts and (v) the pre—
diction method should be with a web—server accessible to public.
Below, we are to address these points one by one, making them very
natural in logic and crystal clear in description.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Benchmark datasets

The benchmark dataset used in this study was derived from the same
510 proteins as used by Xu et al. (2016). The complete amino acid se—
quences of these proteins can be obtained from UniProt (preiler
et (11., 2004). In the last decade or so, various consensus motifs for
SUMO have been suggested. Regardless of their many differences in
details, there is one thing in common, i.e. they all contain the amino

acid residue Lys or K. To make the description mathematically more
rigorous and clear, the Chou’s scheme (Chou, 2001c) was adopted to
formulate peptide samples, as done recently by many authors in
studying the nitrotyrosine sites (Xu et (11., 2014), methylation sites
(Qiu et (11., 2014) and protein—protein—binding sites (Jia et (11., 2015b).
According to Chou’s scheme, a potential hydroxylation site—
containing peptide sample can be generally expressed by

MK) : R_§R_(§_1)---R_2R_1KR+1R+2---R+(§_1)R+§ (1)

where the symbol K denotes the single amino acid code K, the sub—
script 5 is an integer, R_§ represents the é—th upstream amino acid
residue from the center, the R15 the é—th downstream amino acid
residue and so forth. The (25 + 1)—tuple peptide sample PgOK) can
be further classified into the following two categories:

PEOK), if its center belongs to sumoylation site

MK) 6 {

P; (K), otherwise

where  denotes a true sumoylation segment,  a false
sumoylation segment and the symbol 6 means ‘a member of’ in the
set theory.

In literature the benchmark dataset usually consists of a training
dataset and a testing dataset: the former is used for training a model,
while the latter for testing the model. But as pointed out in a compre—
hensive review (Chou and Shen, 2007a), there is no need to artificially
separate a benchmark dataset into the two parts if the prediction
model is examined by the jackknife test or sub—sampling (K—fold)
cross—validation since the outcome thus obtained is actually from a
combination of many different independent dataset tests. Thus, the
benchmark dataset for the current study can be formulated as

8,: s; u s; (3)

where the positive subset S; contains only the true sumoylation
samples PEOK), and the negative subset SE contains the false sumoy—
lation segments  only [see Equation (2)]; while U denotes the
symbol of ‘union’ in the set theory.

Since the length of peptide sample P§(K) is 25 + 1 [see Equation
(1)], the benchmark dataset with different 5 value will contain peptide
segments with different number of amino acid residues. In the study
carried out recently by Xu et al. (2016), however, they selected

5 : 10;i.e. the length of peptide sample is 21 (4)

In order to facilitate comparison with their method, in this study,
let us also assign the value 10 for the window parameter 5. Thus,
Equations (1) and (3) can be reduced to

POK) : R—lOR—9 ' ' 'R_2R_1KR+1R+2 - - -R+9R+1o
S : SJr U S—

The detailed procedures in constructing the benchmark dataset S
are as follows. (i) As done in (Chou, 2001c), slide the 21—tuple peptide
window along each of the aforementioned 510 protein sequences, and
collected were only those peptide segments that have K (Lys or lysine)
at the center [see Equation (1)]. (ii) If the upstream or downstream in a
protein sequence was less than 10 or greater than (L — 10) where L is
the length of the protein sequence concerned, the lacking amino acid
was filled with a dummy residue X. (iii) The peptide segment samples
thus obtained were put into the positive subset if their centers have been
experimentally annotated as the sumoylation sites; otherwise, into the
negative subset. (iv) The peptide samples thus obtained were subject to
a screening procedure to window those that had 2 40% pairwise se—
quence identity to any other in a same subset. By following the above

procedures, we finally obtained 755 positive samples, 9944 negative
samples. For readers’ convenience, their detailed sequences are given in
Supplementary Materials S1 and S2, respectively.

2.2 Incorporating sequence—coupled information into
general pseudo—amino acid composition
With the avalanche of biological sequence generated in the post—genomic
age, one of the most important problems in computational biology is
how to formulate a biological sequence with a discrete model or a vec—
tor, yet still considerably keep its sequence pattern or order information.
This is because all the existing machine—learning algorithms can only
handle vector but not sequence samples, as elaborated in Chou (2015 ).

To address this problem, the pseudo—amino acid composition
(Chou, 2001a, b) or PseAAC was proposed. Ever since the concept
of pseudo—amino acid composition or Chou’s PseAAC (Cao et (11.,
2013; Du et (11., 2012; Lin and Lapointe, 2013) was proposed, it has
rapidly penetrated into nearly all the areas of computational prote—
omics (see, e.g. Ahmad et (11., 2016; Dehzangi et (11., 2015; Kabir
and Hayat, 2016; Khan et (11., 2015; Kumar et (11., 2015; Mondal
and Pai, 2014; Tang et (11., 2016; Wang et (11., 2015 as well as a long
list of references cited in Chen et al. 2015b; Du et al. 2014 and
many biomedicine and drug development areas (Zhong and Zhou,
2014; Zhou, 2015; Zhou and Zhong, 2016)). Because it has been
widely and increasingly used, recently three powerful open access
soft—wares, called ‘PseAAC—Builder’ (Du et (11., 2012), ‘propy’ (Cao
et (11., 2013) and ‘PseAAC—General’ (Du et (11., 2014), were estab—
lished: the former two are for generating various modes of Chou’s
special PseAAC; while the third one for those of Chou’s general
PseAAC (Chou, 2011), including not only all the special modes of
feature vectors for proteins but also the higher level feature vectors
such as ‘Functional Domain’ mode [see Equations (9)—(10) of Chou,
2011], ‘Gene Ontology’ mode [see Equations (11)—(12) of Chou,
2011] and ‘Sequential Evolution’ or ‘PSSM’ mode [see Equations
(13)—(14) of Chou, 2011]. Inspired by the successes of using
PseAAC to deal with protein/peptide sequences, three web—servers
(Chen et (11., 2014c, 2015c; Liu et (11., 2015c) were developed for
generating various feature vectors for DNA/RNA sequences as well.
Particularly, recently a powerful web—server called Pse—in—One (Liu
et (11., 2015d) has been developed that can be used to generate any
desired feature vectors for protein/peptide and DNA/RNA sequences
according to the need of users’ studies.

According to the general PseAAC (Chou, 2011), the peptide se—
quence in Equation (5) can be formulated as

POK) I PTOK) - P_(K) (6)
where

In the above Equation (7), pf10(R_1ojR_9) is the conditional
probability of amino acid R_1o occurring at the left 1st position [see
Equation (5 )] given that its closest right neighbor is R_9; pf9(R_9j
R_g) is the conditional probability of amino acid R_9 occurring at
the left 2nd position given that its closest right neighbor is R_g; and
so forth. Note that in Equation (7), only pf1(R_1) and p:1(R+1) are
of non—conditional probability since the right neighbor of R_1 and
the left neighbor of R11 are always K or Lys. All these probability
values can be easily derived from the positive samples in
Supplementary Material S1, as done in Chou (1996). Likewise, the
components in Equation (8) are the same as those in Equation (7)
except for that they are derived from the negative samples in
Supplementary Material S2.

2.3 Generalized covariance discriminant algorithm
The covariant discriminant (CD) algorithm has been widely used in
bioinformatics, such as predicting protein structural classes (Chou,
1999; Chou et (11., 1998; Chou and Maggiora, 1998; Chou and
Zhang, 1994; Liu and Chou, 1998; Zhou, 1998; Zhou and Assa—
Munt, 2001), protein subcellular localization (Chou, 20003; Chou
and Elrod, 1998; Chou and Elrod, 1999b; Zhou and Doctor, 2003),
membrane protein type (Chou and Elrod, 1999a), GPCR types
(Chou, 2005a; Chou and Elrod, 2002; Elrod and Chou, 2002), en—
zyme family classes (Chou and Elrod, 2003) and nucleosome pos—
itioning (Chen et 111., 20123).

To make the feature vector as defined in Equation (6) easier to
be expressed in the CD algorithm, let us define

lP’:P(K):[‘P1 ~11;  ‘1’10 T11  ‘i’zojT (9)

where T is the transposing operator, and

T1 = PEAR—10R») _p:1O(R-10R-9)

Suppose the standard feature vectors for the peptide samples in
8+ and S- are, respectively, expressed by

_ _ _ _ _ _ T

peptide sample in the positive dataset ST, 12,, for the lath peptide
sample in the negative dataset ST, N+ the total number of peptide
samples in S+ and N ‘ the total number of peptide samples in 8‘.

Thus, whether a query peptide sequence sample lP’ belongs to the
sumoylation site subset S+ or non—sumoylation site subset S- will be
judged by

Sgn(5) : arg min5{lF(]P’,le}, (5 : + or —) (13)

where Sgn(5) is the argument of 5 that minimize 1170131115), which ac—
cording to the CD algorithm is defined as (Chou and Maggiora,
1998)

117011117) : D2011?) +1njC5] — 2111151369] + A1n(2n) (14)

In Equation (14), A is the dimension of the feature vector that is
a constant and hence the term Aln(2n) can be ignored in this study.

Its determinant is denoted by )C5) and its inverse matrix by C31.
Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (Mahalanobis, 1936) is given by
(Chou, 1995b; Chou and Zhang, 1994)

132011117) : (JP—ﬁfcgl (JP—117) (18)

It is important to point out, however, that the 20 components in
Equation (9) are defined by the probability distribution [see
Equation (10)] and hence they are constrained by some sort of con—
dition (Chou, 1995b). Therefore, of the 20 components, only 19 are
completely independent. As a consequence, the covariance C5 of

Equation (16) must be a singular one (Chou and Zhang, 1994),
making the ]F function [Equation (14)] divergent and meaningless.
To avoid such a situation, the dimension—reducing procedure (Chou
and Zhang, 1994) was adopted. The concrete procedure is as fol—
lows. Instead of 20—D space, a peptide sample is defined in a 19—D
space by leaving out one of its 20 components. The remaining 19
components will be completely independent; therefore, the corres—
ponding covariance matrix C5 will no longer be singular. However,
a question might be raised: which one of the 20 components should
be left out? The answer is any one. Will it yield different outcome by
removing a different component? The answer is no. The reason is
that, according to Chou’s invariance theorem, the outcome of the
Mahalanobis distance will remain the same regardless of which one
of the components is left out. For the rigorous proof of Chou’s in—
variance theorem, see the Appendix A of Chou (1995b). For a brief
introduction about Chou’s invariance theorem, see the Wikipedia
article at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chou’s_invariance_theorem.
Accordingly, in practical calculation, instead of the 20 X 20 matrix
version as shown in Equation (16 ), we should use its 19 X 19 matrix
version for C5. Furthermore, the 2nd term in the ]F function of
Equation (14) can be formulated as (Chou and Elrod, 1999a; Chou
and Elrod, 1999b)

ln(2122---219220) for the 20><20 version
lnjC5) : (19)

ln(AZA3A4---219) for the 19>< 19 version

where 0 : 21 < 22 < 23 < - - - are the eigenvalue values of the de—
terminant )C5).

Note that in the early studies of using CD algorithm to predict
protein structural classes (Chou, 1995b; Chou and Zhang, 1994;
Chou, 1995a), only the term of Mahalanobis distance [Equation
(18)] was used to calculate the F function of Equation (14). In a ser—
ies of subsequent studies on predicting protein structural classes
(Chou, 1999; Chou et (11., 1998; Chou and Maggiora, 1998; Liu and
Chou, 1998; Zhou, 1998; Zhou and Assa—Munt, 2001), protein sub—
cellular localization (Chou, 2000a; Chou and Elrod, 1998; Chou
and Elrod, 1999b; Zhou and Doctor, 2003), membrane protein
types (Chou and Elrod, 1999a), GPCR types (Chou, 2005a; Chou
and Elrod, 2002; Elrod and Chou, 2002), enzyme family classes
(Chou and Elrod, 2003) and nucleosome positioning (Chen et (11.,
2012a), the 2nd term lnjC5j in Equation (14) was included as well,
and the prediction quality was remarkably improved. In this study,
we are to further include the 3rd term 21n [9365)] in Equation (14).
The reason to do so is that in the current case the prior probability
of subset S+ is much smaller than that of subset 8‘ [see Equation
(15 )]. In other words, when the CD algorithm was used to study a
system in which the subsets of benchmark dataset was not very
skewing, it would be OK by just using the 1st and 2nd terms of
Equation (14). But when the benchmark dataset is very unbalanced
or highly skewing, the 3rd term must be taken into account.
Otherwise, if S+ << 8‘, many positive sample might be incorrectly
predicted as negative; and vice versa. To fix such a bias problem
when using the operation engines rather than CD algorithm, special
treatments, such as dataset optimization (Xiao et (11., 2015), Monte
Carlo sampling (Jia et (11., 2016a) and fusion approach (Jia et (11.,
2016b; Jia et (11., 2016d; Qiu et (11., 2016b), were needed. The ad—
vantage of using CD algorithm is that it has automatically included
the function to deal with the skewing dataset problem, but it was
just ignored by the aforementioned investigators and hence missing
the contribution from the 3rd term of Equation (14).

The predictor thus established is called ‘pSumo—CD’, where ‘p’
stands for ‘prediction’, ‘Sumo’ for ‘sumoylation site’ and ‘CD’ for
‘covariance discriminant algorithm’.

3 Results and discussion

As pointed out in the Introduction section, one of the keys in estab—
lishing a useful predictor is how to properly evaluate its anticipated
success rates. To realize this, we need to consider two things: one is
what metrics or scales should be used to quantitatively measure its
prediction quality; the other is what validation method should be
adopted to calculate or derive the metrics values. Below, let us ad—
dress the two problems

3.1 A set of four metrics

The following four metrics are usually used in literature to measure
the quality of binary classification: (i) overall accuracy or Acc; (ii)
Mathew’s correlation coefficient or MCC; (iii) sensitivity or Sn and
(iv) specificity or Sp (see, e.g. Chen et (11., 2007). Unfortunately, the
conventional formulations for the four are not intuitive and that
most experimental scientists feel difficult to understand them, par—
ticularly for the one of MCC. Interestingly, using the Chou’s sym—
bols and derivation in studying signal peptides (Chou, 2001b), the
aforementioned four metrics can be easily converted into a set of fol—
lowing equations (Chen et (11., 2013; Xu et (11., 2013):

(20)

where N+ represents the total number of sumoylation sites investi—
gated, whereas N; the number of true sumoylation sites incorrectly
predicted to be of non—sumoylation site; N ‘ the total number of the
non—sumoylation sites investigated, whereas N; the number of non—
sumoylation sites incorrectly predicted to be of sumoylation site.
According to Equation (20), it is crystal clear to see the follow—
ing. When Ni : 0 meaning none of the true sumoylation sites are
incorrectly predicted to be of non—sumoylation site, we have the sen—
sitivity Sn : 1. When N; : N+ meaning that all the sumoylation
sites are incorrectly predicted to be of non—sumoylation site, we have
the sensitivity Sn : 0. Likewise, when N; : 0 meaning none of the
non—sumoylation sites are incorrectly predicted to be of sumoylation
site, we have the specificity Sp : 1; whereas N; : N ‘ meaning
that all the non—sumoylation sites are incorrectly predicted to be of
sumoylation sites, we have the specificity Sp : 0. When
N f : N; : 0 meaning that none of sumoylation sites in the positive
dataset and none of the non—sumoylation sites in the negative dataset
are incorrectly predicted, we have the overall accuracy Acc : 1 and
MCC : 1; when N; : NJr and N; : N‘ meaning that all the
sumoylation sites in the positive dataset and all the non—sumoylation
sites in the negative dataset are incorrectly predicted, we have the
overall accuracy Acc : 0 and MCC : —1; whereas when
N; : N+/2 and N; : N‘/2, we have Acc : 0.5 and MCC : 0

meaning no better than random guess. Therefore, using Equation
(20) has made the meanings of sensitivity, specificity, overall accur—
acy and Mathew’s correlation coefficient much more intuitive and
easier—to—understand, particularly for the meaning of MCC, as con—
curred recently by many investigators (see, e.g. Chen et (11., 2014a,
b, 2015a, 2016a, b, c; Ding et (11., 2014; Jia et (11., 2015a, b, 2016a;
Liu et (11., 2015a, b, 2016b, c, d, e; Qiu et (11., 2016a, b, c; Xiao
et (11., 2015; Xiao et (11., 2016).

Note that, however, the set of equations defined in Equation
(20) is valid only for the single—label systems. For the multi—label sys—
tems whose emergence has become more frequent in system biology
(Chou et (11., 2012; Lin et (11., 2013; Xiao et (11., 2011) and system
medicine (Xiao et (11., 2013; Qiu et (11., 2016d), a completely differ—
ent set of metrics are needed as elaborated in Chou (2013).

3.2 Cross—validation

With a set of well—defined metrics to measuring the quality of a pre—
dictor, the next thing is what kind of validation method should be
used to score these metrics. In predictive analytics, the following
three cross—validation methods are often used: (i) independent data—
set test, (ii) subsampling (or K—fold cross—validation) test and (iii)
jackknife test (Chou and Zhang, 1995). Of these three, however, the
jackknife test is deemed the least arbitrary that can always yield a
unique outcome for a given benchmark dataset as elucidated in
Chou (201 1). Accordingly, the jackknife test has been widely recog—
nized and increasingly used by investigators to examine the quality
of various predictors (see, e.g. Ahmad et (11., 2016; Cai et (11., 2003;
Chou and Cai, 2003, 2005; Dehzangi et (11., 2015; Fan et (11., 2015;
Ju et (11., 2016; Kabir and Hayat, 2016; Khan et (11., 2015; Kumar
et (11., 2015; Mondal and Pai, 2014; Shen et (11., 2007; Tang et (11.,
2016; Zhou, 1998; Zhou and Assa—Munt, 2001; Zhou and Doctor,
2003). However, to reduce the computational time, in this study, we
adopted the 10—fold cross—validation, as done by most investigators
with SVM and random forests algorithms as the prediction engine.
Besides, doing so would also facilitate the comparison since the re—
ported results by Xu et al. (2016) was also derived from 10—fold
cross—validation.

3.3 Result analysis and comparison

The success rates achieved by the new predictor iSumo—CD via the
10—fold cross—validation test on the same 510 proteins used by Xu
et al. (2016) are given in Table 1, where for facilitating comparison,
the corresponding rates obtained by the predictor SUMO_LDA (Xu
et (11., 2016) are also listed. As we can see from the table, the rate of
Acc by new predictor pSumo—CD is 97.88%, which is about 11%
higher than that by SUMO_LDA (Xu et (11., 2016). The rate of
MCC by pSumo—CD is 0.846, about 16% higher than that of
SUMO_LDA. It is instructive to point out that, of the four metrics
defined in Equation (20), the most important are the Acc and MCC
(Chen et (11., 2016a, c): the former reﬂects the overall accuracy of a
predictor; while the latter, its stability in practical applications. The
metrics Sn and Sp are used to measure a predictor from two opposite
angles. When, and only when, both Sn and Sp of the predictor A are
higher than those of the predictor B, can we say A is better than B
(Liu et (11., 2016d). In other words, Sn and Sp are actually con—
strained with each other (Chou, 1993). Therefore, it is meaningless
to use only one of the two for comparing the quality of two pre—
dictors. A meaningful comparison in this regard should consider the
rates of both Sn and Sp, or even better consider the rate of their com—
bination that is none but just the score of MCC as shown in Table 1.

Each of the components is marked on the horizontal axis, and its average
value on the vertical axis. The red histogram is for the mean value derived
from the positive subset, and the blue for that from the negative subset. See
the text for further explanation

Why could the proposed method be able to increase the predic—
tion quality so substantially? First, a special term in the CD algo—
rithm, namely 21nj‘B(S")] of Equation (14), has been taken into
account in the current study. The term has the function to adjust the
errors caused by the bias in a highly unbalanced benchmark dataset.
Second, the amino acid—coupled effects around the sumoylation sites
have been taken into account via the conditional probability ap—
proach as formulated in Equations (6 )—(10). As a result, the cluster
of the true—sumoylation samples (Fig. 1) can be more distinctly sep—
arated with that of the false—sumoylation samples, leading to a better
success rates in discriminating them from each other. Similar re—
markable successes have also been observed in predicting beta—turns
(Zhang and Chou, 1997), alpha—turns (Chou, 1997), tight turns and
their types in proteins (Chou, 2000b), specificity of GalNAc—
transferase (Chou, 1995c), HIV protease cleavage sites (Chou,
1993; Chou et (11., 1996; Zhang and Chou, 1993), as well as signal
peptide cleavage sites (Chou, 2001d; Chou and Shen, 2007b; Shen
and Chou, 2007).

3.4 Web server and user guide

To enhance the value of its practical applications, the web—server for
pSumo—CD has been established at http://www.jci—bioinfo.cn/
pSumo—CD. Furthermore, to maximize the convenience for the ma—
jority of experimental scientists, a step—by—step guide is provided
below.

Step 1. Opening the web—server at http://www.jci—bioinfo.cn/
pSumo—CD, you will see its top page on your computer screen, as
shown in Figure 2. Click on the Read Me button to see a brief intro—
duction about the pSumo—CD predictor.

http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/pSumo-CD

Step 2. Either type or copy/paste the query protein sequences
into the input box at the center of Figure 2. The input sequence
should be in the FASTA format. For the examples of sequences in
FASTA format, click the Example button right above the input box.

Step 3. Click on the Submit button to see the predicted result.
For example, if you use the three query protein sequences in the
Example window as the input, in about 205 after your submitting,
you will see the following on the screen of your computer: (i) The
1st query protein (O95 644) contains 51 K residues, of which residue
277, 293 and 703 are highlighted with red, meaning able to be of
sumoylation. (ii) The 2nd query protein (B7ZR65) contains 25 K
residues, of which residues 55, 253 and 365 are able to be of sumoy—
lation. (iii) The 3rd query protein (P03496) contains 12 K residues,
of which only the one at position 70 is highlighted with red meaning
able to be of sumoylation. All the (51 + 25 + 12) : 88 predicted
outcomes are fully consistent with experimental observations except
for the following two cases: residue 55 in the 2nd query protein was
over—predicted (false positive) and residue 219 in the 3rd query pro—
tein was missed (false negative).

Step 4. As shown on the lower panel of Figure 2, you may also
choose the batch prediction by entering your e—mail address and
your desired batch input file (in FASTA format of course) via the
Browse button. To see the sample of batch input file, click on the
button Batch—example.

4 Conclusion

The pSumo—CD predictor is a new bioinformatics tool for identify—
ing the sumoylation sites in proteins. Compared with the existing
state—of—the—art predictor in this area, its prediction quality is much
better, with remarkably higher overall accuracy and stability. For
the convenience of most experimental scientists, we have provided
its web—server and a step—by—step guide, by which users can easily
obtain their desired results without the need to go through the de—
tailed mathematics. The reason of including them in this paper is for
the integrity of the new prediction method, and also for that some
interesting techniques, such as incorporating the sequence—coupled
approach into the general PseAAC, introducing the prior probability

term in the CD algorithm to adjust the bias errors caused by unbal—
anced training dataset, and applying Chou’s invariance theorem to
overcome the divergence problem, may be of use as well in develop—
ing other tools in computational biology.

We anticipate that pSumo—CD will become a very useful high
throughput tool for both basic research and drug development in the
areas relevant to the protein sumoylation.

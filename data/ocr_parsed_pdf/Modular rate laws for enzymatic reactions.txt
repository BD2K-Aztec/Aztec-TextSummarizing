ABSTRACT

Motivation: Standard rate laws are a key requisite for systematically
turning metabolic networks into kinetic models. They should provide
simple, general and biochemically plausible formulae for reaction
velocities and reaction elasticities. At the same time, they need to
respect thermodynamic relations between the kinetic constants and
the metabolic fluxes and concentrations.

Results: We present a family of reversible rate laws for reactions with
arbitrary stoichiometries and various types of regulation, including
mass—action, Michaelis—Menten and uni—uni reversible Hill kinetics
as special cases. With a thermodynamically safe parameterization of
these rate laws, parameter sets obtained by model fitting, sampling
or optimization are guaranteed to lead to consistent chemical
equilibrium states. A reformulation using saturation values yields
simple formulae for rates and elasticities, which can be easily
adjusted to the given stationary flux distributions. Furthermore, this
formulation highlights the role of chemical potential differences as
thermodynamic driving forces. We compare the modular rate laws
to the thermodynamic—kinetic modelling formalism and discuss a
simplified rate law in which the reaction rate directly depends on
the reaction affinity. For automatic handling of modular rate laws, we
propose a standard syntax and semantic annotations for the Systems
Biology Markup Language.

1 INTRODUCTION

Once a metabolic network is available as a stoichiometric matrix
or in standard formats such as Systems Biology Markup Language
(SBML; Hucka et (11., 2003), its potential dynamics can be studied by
various kinds of mathematical analysis. Constraint-based methods
such as ﬂux balance analysis (Edwards and Palsson, 2000; Price
et (11., 2004) help to predict the possible metabolic ﬂuxes; energy
balance analysis (Beard et (11., 2002; 2004), network-embedded
thermodynamic (NET) analysis (Kummel et (11., 2006) or related
methods (Hoppe et (11., 2007) also account for the thermodynamic

forces driving the ﬂuxes. Finally, given a stationary ﬂux distribution,
the potential dynamic behaviour close to this steady state can be
explored by random sampling of reaction elasticities (Steuer et (11.,
2006; Wang et (11., 2004).

Precise dynamic simulations, in contrast, require quantitative
rate laws for the enzymatic reactions. The catalytic mechanisms
of key enzymes have been investigated in great detail and described
by mathematical formulae (for an overview, see Cornish-Bowden,
2004; Segel, 1993). But many kinetic equations are still unknown
and have to be substituted by stande rate laws (Heij nen, 2005) such
as mass—action kinetics, power laws (Savageau, 1970), reversible
Hill kinetics (Hofmeyr and Cornish-Bowden, 1997), lin-log kinetics
(Visser and Heijnen, 2003), convenience kinetics (Liebermeister and
Klipp, 2006a), generic rate equations (Lee et (11., 2007) or TKM rate
laws (Ederer and Gilles, 2007). Many mechanistically inspired rate
laws share the form (Hofmeyr, 1995)

The numerator Tr contains turnover rates kit (in s_1), metabolite
concentrations Q (in mM), reactant constants kg (in mM) and

substrate and product molecularities  It resembles a reversible
mass—action rate law, but in Equation (1), it is multiplied by the
enzyme amount 11, and a factor fr for enzyme regulation. The
denominator Dr is a polynomial of scaled concentrations, e.g.
D, = l +c1/kivlI +c2/kg +  The individual denominator terms
correspond to different binding states of the enzyme, which
effectively reduce the enzyme amount available for catalysis. Terms
arising from the speciﬁc enzyme regulation (see Cornish-Bowden,
2004) are separately listed in the term Dieg.

Depending on the reaction stoichiometry, on the enzymatic
mechanism and on allosteric regulation, the terms fr, Tr, Dr and
Dng may assume various mathematical forms. In this article,
we propose several variants for each of them, which can be
combined in a modular manner (see Fig. l). The resulting
rate laws represent a good compromise between biochemical
detail (description of enzyme saturation, activation and inhibition,
correct thermodynamic properties, and interpretable parameters) and
mathematical abstraction (simple and standardized formulae for
various reaction stoichiometries and types of allosteric regulation)
and provide a good way to parameterize metabolic network models.

2 METHODS

2.1 Five rate laws

In this article. we shall discuss ﬁve modular rate laws (called
‘common’. ‘direct binding”. ‘simultaneous binding”. ‘power-law’ and ‘force-
dependent”). characterized by different formulae of their denominators. The
common modular (CM) rate law is a generalized form of the reversible
MichaelisiMenten kinetics that applies to any reaction stoichiometry. For a
non-regulated reaction A+B <—> 2 C with concentrations a. b and c. the rate
(in mol/s) reads

k‘l'a’b’ —k_c’2
v:“(1 +a’)(l +b’)+(l+c’)2— 1

with the abbreviations a’ = a / kg. 17’ = b/kgI and c’ = c/kM. reactant constants

kR/I. kg. and kg (mM). and turnover rates ki (5—1). The enzyme level u is
given as an amount (mmol). It can also be a concentration (mM). but then
the rate has to be multiplied by the compartment volume (1).

The rate law can be obtained from the random-order enzyme mechanism
shown in Figure 2. Each term in the denominator D: 1+a’ +b’ +a’b’ +
c’ +c’ +c’2 represents one binding state of the enzyme. The kM values
are dissociation constants. just like the KM values in MichaelisiMenten
kinetics. and deﬁne a scale for high and low concentrations of a reactant.
The CM rate law resembles the convenience kinetics (Liebermeister and
Klipp, 2006a). with a slight difference for molecularities mi 751: in the
convenience kinetics. in Equation (3). the denominator term for the product
C would read l+c’ +c’2 instead of 1+2c’ +c’2. The reason is that in the
CM rate law. the ﬁrst C molecule can bind to either of the two binding sites.
while in the convenience kinetics. the sites are bound in a ﬁxed order.

The other four rate have simpler denominators. By omitting some of the
terms. we obtain the direct binding modular (DM) rate law

k+a’b’ —k‘ dz k+ab/kM+ —k‘ cz/kM_

= = 4
v “ 1+a’b’+c’2 “ 1+ab/kM++c2/kM- U

(3)

 

in which the kM values can be joined to parameters kM+ = kR/I kg and kM_ =
(kg/I); In contrast to the CM rate law. the denominator contains just the
substrate and product terms of the highest order. With the same choice of
parameters. the reaction rate is higher than in the CM rate law. especially at
low concentrations where the lower-order terms dominate. The simultaneous
binding modular (SM) rate law
k‘l'a’b’—k_c’2
v = u —

(1+a’)(1+b’)(1+c’)2i
on the other hand. contains additional denominator terms. so the reaction
rate is lower. especially at high concentrations.

By setting the denominator to a constant value of l. we obtain the power-
law modular (PM) rate law

2.2 General form of the modular rate laws

We can rewrite all modular rate laws in a general notation that covers
various stoichiometries. rate laws and types of allosteric regulation; for a
list of symbols. see Table l. A biochemical network with reaction rates v,
and concentrations 0,» is described by the stoichiometric matrix N =(nir).
The index i runs over all compounds with variable or ﬁxed concentrations
(called ‘internal’ or ‘external’ compounds. respectively). To deﬁne the rate
laws. we introduce structure numbers mi and wi describing how many
molecules of compound i are apparently involved in a reaction r as substrates
(mi). products (mi). activators (wi) and inhibitors (wi). In contrast to
the stoichiometric coefﬁcients. which are used in the balance equation
dc, / d122, nirv,(c) for the internal metabolites. the structure numbers mi
denote the apparent molecularities within the kinetic laws. Both are closely
related. By default. all relevant regulation numbers wi are set to a value
of l and the molecularities mi are given by the (absolute) stoichiometric
coefﬁcients. But in general. we may choose arbitrary positive numbers wi
and set

m+. = h, |ni,| if ni, < 0, 0 otherwise
’1 . . . (8)
mi 2 h, |ni,| 1f ni, > 0, 0 otherw1se

with positive cooperativity factors 11,. We can always replace h, ni, 2m; —
mi and for convenience. we deﬁne mri =mi +mi. The cooperativity factor
11, yields sigmoidal rate laws similar to reversible Hill kinetics (Hofmeyr
and Cornish-Bowden. 1997) and provides some freedom to rescale the sum
formulae. For a reaction 0.5 A —> B. for instance. we are not obliged to use a
rate law v ~ k‘l'al/2 — k‘b. but can choose v ~ k+a — k‘ 1)2 instead. But in any
case. the structure numbers mi need to have the form (8) because otherwise.
the rate laws would be thermodynamically inconsistent (see Supplementary
Material). Next. we introduce the saturation values

We now deﬁne the modular rate laws by formula (1). where the numerator

Rate laws for unspeciﬁc enzymes can be constructed by combining
denominators from the different catalysed reactions (see Supplementary
Material). Allosteric regulation is implemented by the terms

The relative basal rates pi can vary between 0 and l and represent the rate
without activator divided by the rate at saturating activator levels. Relative
basal rates pl, for inhibitors are deﬁned accordingly. If a basal rate is set
to zero. the regulation is called complete activation or inhibition (or in
more familiar terms. essential activation and non-competitive inhibition).
Otherwise. we obtain partial activation or inhibition. which are also called
stimulation and hyperbolic inhibition. In addition. we consider another type
of regulation. which we call speciﬁc activation or inhibition. Regulation

2.3 Thermodynamic properties

The laws of thermodynamics link the reaction rates tightly to thermodynamic
forces and to the molar Gibbs free energies of the compounds involved.
called chemical potentials 11,. In an ideal mixture. the chemical potentials are
linked to the concentrations c, (measured in units of a standard concentration.
usually 1 mM) via

m=u§0>+RT1nci (14)

with the absolute temperature T (K) and Boltzmann’s gas constant R. A
central concept in reaction thermodynamics is the chemical equilibrium

state. in which the total Gibbs free energy is minimal and all net reaction
rates vanish. The massiaction ratios (1?“ =]_[i(c,)”” in equilibrium follow
from thermodynamic properties of the molecules. They are identical for
all equilibrium states and. therefore. called equilibrium constants quz
l_li(C?q)mr-

A kinetic model that does not show consistent equilibrium states runs
the risk of describing a perpetuum mobile. We can test it by numerical
simulations (see Supplementary Material); but thermodynamical consistency
can be directly ensured when choosing the kinetic constants. First. the
numerator of [Equation (2)] has to vanish for any choice of equilibrium
concentrations ch. With structure numbers given by Equation (8). this leads
to a Haldane relationship of the form

called reaction afﬁnities (kJ/mol). The second law of thermodynamic requires
that chemical reactions consume Gibbs free energy. so reaction rates and
afﬁnities must share the same sign:

v, #0:sign(v,)=sign(A,). (19)

A vanishing reaction rate implies that either there is no driving force
(A,=0. chemical equilibrium) or the reaction is kinetically blocked. e.g.
because there is no enzyme (u, :0. but A 75 0). Given a metabolic network.
feasible ﬂuxes v, and reaction afﬁnities A, respecting condition (19) can be
determined by energy balance analysis or NET analysis.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Properties of the saturable rate laws

The ﬁve modular rate laws, shown in Figure 4, have particular
strengths and weaknesses. While the CM rate law is biochemically
most plausible, the DM, SM and PM rate laws can be obtained by
ignoring (DM and PM rate laws) or adding (SM rate law) some of
the binding states and, therefore, some of the denominator terms.
As a consequence, these rate laws represent upper (DM and PM
rate laws) and lower (SM rate law) bounds of the CM rate law.
This simpliﬁcation can reduce the number of parameters. In the DM
enzyme mechanism, the substrate molecules bind in a single step,
so their kM values can be combined into a single parameter kM+,
and likewise for the reaction products. In the PM rate law, the kM+
values can ﬁirther be merged with the catalytic constants ki. The

which leads to simple formulae for the reaction elasticities.
However, its enzyme mechanism assumes a simultaneous binding
of all substrates and products, which is biochemically arguable and
would block the enzyme at high reactant concentrations.

3.2 Thermodynamically safe parameterization

We already saw that the kinetic constants in a metabolic system
need to satisfy the Wegscheider conditions (17) and Haldane
relationships (15). This may lead to numerous and complicated
constraints in parameter ﬁtting and optimization. Luckily, this
obstacle can be overcome by a special, thermodynamically safe
parameterization using independent parameter sets (Liebermeister
and Klipp, 2005, 2006a). First, we introduce the standard chemical

potentials ago) and the geometric mean values k), = , / kj— k,— of the

turnover rates as independent model parameters. Then, equilibrium

constants satisfying the Wegscheider conditions are computed

from Equation (16) and turnover rates ki satisfying the Haldane

relationships (15) are computed by kit =ky(kfq H(k%[)_"”)ihr/2

or

lnkri=1nkrVi3r mfg—Emmi? . (25)
i
With Equations (16) and (25), all kinetic constants can

be written as linear functions of the independent parameters.
This parameterization automatically ensures correct Wegscheider

conditions and Haldane relations, which can greatly simplify
parameter ﬁtting and optimization (Liebermeister and Klipp, 2006b).

For practical purposes, the numerator can be parameterized in
alternative ways: the explicit version, as in Equation (2), contains the
turnover rates kit as parameters. In the Haldane-compliant version,
they are substituted by Equation (25), so the Haldane relationships
are automatically satisﬁed and the equilibrium constants and the
k), appear as parameters. In the Wegscheider-compliant version, the
equilibrium constants are ﬁirther expressed by the standard chemical
potentials vi(1 Equation (16), so the Wegscheider conditions will
also be satisﬁed. This version yields thermodynamically correct
models, but it comes with a higher numerical effort. In practice,
one may ﬁrst employ the Wegscheider-compliant version, estimate
the parameters, and then use them to compute parameters for the
other versions. An example is given in the Supplementary Material.

3.3 The FM rate law

With the help of Equations (22) and (25), and using the identity
ﬁ— ./1/x = 2sinh(1“TX), the numerator (2) can be rewritten as

With this formula, any modular rate law (1) can be written as a

 

2RT
which depends directly on the reaction afﬁnity. The reaction rate
increases with the reaction afﬁnity A, and has the same sign.
However, the numerator cannot be solely written as a ﬁinction of
A, because of the remaining term V6+6_, which also involves
the reactant concentrations. But if we repeat the same term in the
denominator, it cancels out and we obtain the simple rate law

it A
v,=u,ky2sinh< ’ ’) (27)

product of positive terms multiplied by the force term sinh (h’A’ ),

 

2RT

without any explicit dependence on concentrations or kM values.
This is nothing but the FM rate law.

In contrast to the other modular rate laws, the FM rate law
lacks the biochemically required denominator summand 1 and is
not supported by a biochemical mechanism. Even worse, as one of
the substrate or product concentrations goes to zero, the reaction
afﬁnity and accordingly the rate becomes inﬁnite—a drawback that
is also shared by the lin-log kinetics (Visser and Heijnen, 2003).
Despite these shortcomings, the FM rate law is a simple and practical
choice because it can easily be adjusted to given stationary ﬂux
distributions. If the reaction rates and afﬁnities in a network are
given, e.g. from a previous energy balance analysis, the remaining
prefactor wk), can be computed and the rate law is completely
speciﬁed.

The direct relationship between rate and afﬁnity makes the FM
rate law a nice illustration case for Prigogine’s principle of minimal
entropy production (Prigogine, 1947). In thermodynamic systems
with a linear velocity—force relationship v, ~A,, states of minimal
entropy production have to be stationary. For metabolic systems, this
principle does usually not even apply as an approximation because
the ﬂuxes cannot be directly written as a function of the reaction
afﬁnities. For the FM rate law, however, this is possible and we

obtain a simple criterion for minimal chemical entropy production

Close to chemical equilibrium (A, B 0), the term in square brackets

approaches a constant value of 2, so minimal entropy production
implies N v=0, i.e. a stationary state. Far from equilibrium,
Equation (28) starts to deviate from the steady-state condition. At
the same time, also the approximation sinh(x)Bx breaks down, so
the rate (27) depends nonlinearly on the force and the principle of
minimal entropy production ceases to hold.

 

 

 

3.4 Modular rate laws are equivalent to
thermodynamic—kinetic modelling rate laws

The thermodynamic—kinetic modelling (TKM) formalism (Ederer
and Gilles, 2007) describes biochemical networks in the language
of electrical engineering and highlights the relationship between
concentrations and thermodynamic forces. The TKM rate laws read

v. =K. (net: mgr?) (29>

with a concentration-dependent conductivity K, and thermokinetic
potentials E,- =el"'/RT. Originally, the  values represent the
stoichiometric coefﬁcients ni,, but we may also employ Equation
(8) instead. In analogy to Equation (26), the TKM rate law can be

3.5 Reaction elasticities and control coefﬁcients

The dynamics of kinetic models close to a steady state depends on
their reaction elasticities, i.e. the sensitivities of the reaction rates
to changes of substrate concentrations and other parameters. The
scaled elasticities, deﬁned as the partial derivatives

v, _ alnlvrl _ c,- 8v,
c,- — _—

 

alncl- _ V, 8c,- 7 (32)
are dimensionless and represent an effective reaction order (1 for
irreversible mass—action kinetics, 0 in ﬁill saturation). They are used
to describe the effects of relative changes, for Taylor expansion
on a logarithmic scale, and in the context of log-normal parameter
distributions (Liebermeister and Klipp, 2005).

Reaction elasticities for metabolite concentrations, enzyme
amounts and kinetic constants can be computed from derivatives of
the saturation values. The ﬁrst and second order, scaled and unscaled
elasticities for all modular rate laws and different types of regulation
are given in the Supplementary Material. If we consider the case of

complete activation or inhibition, the scaled substance elasticities
contain three terms

E3; = tag—1354155; (33)
related to thermodynamics, enzyme mechanism and regulation. The

thermodynamic term EC]; can be expressed by the g“, values (i.e.
reaction afﬁnities) or by the forward and backward rates

E3 = dg(z—i>—1[dg(;>M+—M—]
= dg(v>—1[dg(v+)M+ —dg(v—)M—] (34)

where dg(-) denotes diagonal matrices and l=(l, 1,..)T. For
reactions close to equilibrium (A,%0,v,80), this term becomes
inﬁnite, just as expected for scaled elasticities. For an irreversible
forward reaction (|A,| —> oo), in contrast, the thermodynamic term
simply reads mi, so a non-regulated PM rate law will show substrate
elasticity 1 and product elasticity 0. In general, the elasticities are
ﬁirther shifted by the denominator term

ME? = dg(D)_‘ﬁM*[dg(¢+)M++dg(10—)M‘]
DMzEf = dg(D)“ [dg(9+)M++dg(e—)M—]
SMzEg’ = ﬁM*M

FMzEf = 5M

PMzEg’ = 0. (35)

where A =B*C denotes the elementwise multiplication of two
matrices (i.e. (1,]. = bl-j cl-j). The elasticity matrix of the non-regulated
FM rate law can also be written in the simple form

1
E: =ECT —E? = — E dg(v)_1dg(v*)dg(h)NT (36)

with v* = v+ +v_. Complete enzyme activation and inhibition lead
to the regulation term

E’; = aAiW+—ﬂI*W_. (37)

The system’s Jacobian matrix and the metabolic control and
response coefﬁcients (Reder, 1988) can be computed from the
reaction elasticities (33) and the stoichiometric matrix. In a system
with non-regulated PM rate laws, for instance, the elasticities are
given by Eq. (34) and the scaled control matrix reads

CS = — (N [dg(erWJr —dg(v_)M_])_1ng(v). (38)

which can be directly computed from the reaction rates and afﬁnities
vi(1 Equation (23). Due to the equivalence of modular and TKM
rate laws, Equation (38) also represents the response matrix Ri’; =
alnEk / 31mg of a TKM rate law with constant conductivity K,. For
systems with other rate laws and regulated enzymes, the terms (35)
and (37) have to be factored in.

The second-order elasticities describe the interactive effects of

perturbations. In analogy to Equation (33), they can be computed as

4 DISCUSSION

The modular rate laws cover all possible stoichiometries and
several types of regulation with relatively few kinetic parameters
and are, therefore, well suited for translating metabolic networks
systematically into kinetic models. The reaction rate is determined
by four main factors: the thermodynamic force arising from
energies and concentrations of reactants (numerator T), the enzyme
level, the enzymatic mechanism (denominator D) and allosteric
regulation (f and Dreg). All modular rate laws share the same
thermodynamic properties and are reversible, which is a pre-
condition for thermodynamically correct models. If thermodynamic
correctness is not required, irreversible reactions—implying inﬁnite
reaction afﬁnities—can be obtained by omitting the negative term
in the numerator. A reformulation based on reaction afﬁnities links
the reaction rates to the underlying thermodynamic forces, in
close analogy to the thermodynamic—kinetic formalism (Ederer and
Gilles, 2007). A prototypic example is the FM rate law, in which
the rate solely depends on the reaction afﬁnity; the resulting entropy
production density conforms to Prigogine’s principle of minimal
entropy production.

The reaction afﬁnities also have an impact on the reaction
elasticities. Owing to the thermodynamic term, different reaction
elasticities are dependent, so independent random sampling
as proposed by Steuer et (11. (2006) is thermodynamically
incorrect. However, our formulae pave the way to an alternative,
thermodynamically safe sampling scheme: (i) thermodynamically
consistent ﬂuxes and reaction afﬁnities A, are chosen, for instance,
by energy balance analysis based on experimental data; (ii) the
saturation values 53% are chosen independently, e.g. from a uniform
probability distribution, leading to (iii) thermodynamically correct
ﬁrst- and second-order elasticities. With the PM and FM rate law, the
sampling step can be omitted because the elasticities are determined
by the reaction rates and afﬁnities alone.

Modular rate laws can be automatically inserted into SBML
models using semanticSBML (www.semanticsbml.org) or the tool
SBMquueezer (Drager et (11., 2008), which also works as a plug-in
for CellDesigner. The stoichiometry and regulators are read from
the SBML model, while other information, e.g. about the types
of regulation, can be given by Systems Biology Ontology (SBO)
terms. Further details (such as cooperativity factors) or the type of
thermodynamic parameterization needs to be set by the user. To
facilitate this process and to establish a consistent syntax for SBML
models, we propose a nomenclature and SBO (Le Novere, 2006)
annotations for the rate laws and their kinetic parameters in the
Supplementary Material. Among other things, these conventions

help to specify quantitative rate laws within the Systems Biology
Graphical Notation (SBGN; Novere et (11., 2009).

5 CONCLUSIONS

To translate metabolic networks into kinetic models, stande
rate laws are needed as substitutes for unknown rate equations.
The modular rate laws are less accurate than the detailed kinetic
equations, but they are ﬂexible and biochemically plausible,
yield simple formulae for reaction rates and elasticities, and
can be easily inserted into SBML models. Thermodynamically
safe reformulations make it easy to handle the Wegscheider
conditions and Haldane relations. They guarantee consistent
chemical equilibrium states and clarify the role of thermodynamic
forces.

Abstract

Motivation: Both the quantitative real—time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and quantitative
isothermal amplification (qlA) are standard methods for nucleic acid quantification. Numerous
real—time read—out technologies have been developed. Despite the continuous interest in amplifica—
tion—based techniques, there are only few tools for pre—processing of amplification data. However,
a transparent tool for precise control of raw data is indispensable in several scenarios, for example,
during the development of new instruments.

Results: chipPCR is an R package for the pre—processing and quality analysis of raw data of amplifi—
cation curves. The package takes advantage of R’s S4 object model and offers an extensible
environment. chipPCR contains tools for raw data exploration: normalization, baselining, imput—
ation of missing values, a powerful wrapper for amplification curve smoothing and a function to
detect the start and end of an amplification curve. The capabilities ofthe software are enhanced by
the implementation of algorithms unavailable in R, such as a 5—point stencil for derivative interpol—
ation. Simulation tools, statistical tests, plots for data quality management, amplification
efficiency/quantification cycle calculation, and datasets from qPCR and qlA experiments are part of
the package. Core functionalities are integrated in GUls (web—based and standalone shiny applica—
tions), thus streamlining analysis and report generation.

1 Introduction

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and quantitative
isothermal amplification (qIA) are standard methods used for
nucleic acid amplification. qPCR and qIA are used in real-time
monitoring technologies, such as our previously reported VideoScan
technology (Rodiger et 111., 20133; Spiess et (11., 2015), microfluidics
and point-of-care devices to quantify nucleic acids by specific curve
parameters like the quantification point (Cq) (Pabinger et (11., 2014;
Rodiger et (11., 2014). The fundamental steps of amplification curve
analysis are (i) raw data read-in, (ii) pre-processing (e.g. noise

reduction), (iii) amplification curve processing (e.g. Cq calculation),
(iv) post-processing and (v) data export/report generation. Reliable
data flow between all steps is a requirement for the proper optimiza-
tion leg. the Taguchi method) of amplification reactions (Cobb and
Clarkson, 1994). R is widely used in bioinformatics and an early
adopter of novel technologies (e.g. digital PCR, NanoString
nCounter Platform) (Pabinger et (11., 2014; Waggott et (11., 2012).
Available R packages focus on the read-in and (post)-processing of
data from commercial qPCR systems. R packages for the amplifica-
tion analysis steps 1 and 3—5 cited earlier are available (Gehlenborg

chipPCR: An R package to pre—process raw data of amplification curves 2901

 

et al., 2013; McCall et al., 2014; Pabinger et al., 2014; Perkins
et al., 2012). However, R packages for the pre—processing and qual—
ity analysis of raw data of amplification curves are unavailable. Pre—
processing in most commercial cyclers is a black box, which
restrains reproducible research (Leeper, 2014). The development
and optimization of equipment would benefit from the availability
of a software capable of pre—processing raw data. Pre—processing
algorithms remove stochastic errors and artefacts (Supplementary
Section S2) and provide the means for raw data inspection and
transformation in a format suitable for successive analysis steps (e.g.
smoothing, imputation), data reduction (e.g. removal of invalid sets)
and data quality management. Misinterpretations are more likely if
arbitrary corrections are performed and a manual alteration is
contradictory to reproducible research.

The chipPCR (‘Lab—on—a—Chip’ & PCR) package was de—
veloped to automatize pre—processing, analysis, visualization and
quality control of qPCR and qIA experiments. R enables sophisti—
cated statistical and reproducible cross—platform analysis, and
quick adaptation to changing experimental setups. Moreover, it is
advantageous to set up workflows in an open environment, which
offers graphical user interfaces (GU15), downstream analyses facili—
ties, powerful data visualizations and report generation. The target
audience encompasses developers and users who process raw data
from commercial systems.

2 Implementation

We implemented the chipPCR package in the R software environ—
ment. chipPCR is a relative of the MBmca (Rodiger et al., 2013b),
the Real-time PCR Data Markup Language (RDML) (Rodiger
et al., 2015) and the dpcR (Pabinger et al., 2014) packages, but
focuses on pre—processing of amplification curves. The package con—
tains pre—processor functions (smoothing, imputation, background
range detection, baseline correction and normalization), a single—
blinded randomized rating function, quality analysis summary func—
tions, an amplification efficiency function, an amplification curve
simulator and a report generation function (Supplementary Section
S4). The supplemental material uses Donald Knuth’s literate pro—
gramming principle (Knuth, 1984) to conveniently present the
source code. chipPCR’s naming convention is period.separated
(Baath, 2012). We use R’s object model S4 class system
(Supplementary File) to separate between interface and implementa—
tion. S4 classes require a higher effort than S3, but assures better
control on the object structure and the method dispatch. For fast
running of codes in high—throughput applications, we avoided loops
and left options for partially parallel computing usage (e.g.
smoother function). chipPCR includes a set of classes for plotting.
The output of our custom made plots is minimalistic, but many par—
ameters can be adjusted directly or by the ellipse parameter.

We aim to make our software available for researchers not flu—
ent in R. Therefore, we have implemented core functionality of
our package in selected GUI technologies available in R (Rodiger
et al., 2012) as a desktop application or web—based service.
chipPCR offers the means to run the GUI applications as a service
on a server without installing R (e.g. http://michbur.shinyapps.io/
MFIaggr_gui), on a local desktop (e.g. Supplementary Figs S2 and
S6), or as deployed from an external source for a local R installa—
tion. The functions AmpSim, th.cyc, hg.max and amptester are
part of online GUIs. We aimed to build monolithic systems to
parse, pre—process and analyze amplification curve data in a com—
bined work—flow.

Fig. 1. MFIaggr plot for 379 replicate amplification curves. Cycles 1—14 were
selected as region of interest to analyze the cycle-dependent variance (left
panel), the density plot (top-right panel) and quantile-quantile analysis (bot-
tom-right panel), including a comprehensive statistical analysis as textual
output (not shown). The plots indicate that the data of the background range
are normal distributed. The heteroscedasticity is not significant

chipPCR relies solely on the native R workspace and dedicated
R packages as default data import and export format (Perkins et al.,
2012; Rodiger et al., 2015). chipPCR presents S4 objects with tail—
ored summary and plot methods. Because datasets are an essential
element of reproducible research (Leeper, 2014), we have included
datasets from commercial and experimental cyclers to this package.

3 Example: quality analysis

MFIaggr is a versatile analytical and graphical tool for fast multiple
comparison of cycle—dependent signal dispersion and distribution
[Fig. 1; Ruijter et al. (2013) dataset]. The continuous explanatory
variable x (cycle number) is used to describe its relationships to n
continuous predictor variables y, (fluorescence values), where
i6 {1,  .11}. Use cases include the comparison of independent
reaction vessels or the analysis of replicate experiments
(Supplementary Section S6). In particular, this function might be
useful for quality management during the development of high—
throughput technologies. An analysis via the shiny MFIaggrgui app
is shown in Supplementary Figure S7.

4 Results and conclusions

chipPCR is the first R package for the pre—processing and quality
analysis of amplification curve raw data. In addition, we imple—
mented standard methods for amplification curve processing. The
chipPCR functions are embeddable in customized routines with
other packages (Supplementary File), such as the RDML and
MBmca packages. The modular package structure enables flexible
data analysis adaptable to the requirements. For example, solely the
functions inder and smoother are needed to estimate the Cq second
derivative maximum (SDM). smoother will be a method of smooth—
ing in inder, and by putting data in the hg object with summary
method summary-der, the user obtains the Cq. Thanks to GUI’s it
should be easy for users without any R experience.

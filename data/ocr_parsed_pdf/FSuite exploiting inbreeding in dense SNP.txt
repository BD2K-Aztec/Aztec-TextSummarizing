ABSTRACT

Summary: FSuite is a user-friendly pipeline developed for exploiting
inbreeding information derived from human genomic data. It can make
use of single nucleotide polymorphism chip or exome data. Compared
with other software, the advantage of FSuite is that it provides a com-
plete suite of scripts to describe and use the inbreeding information. It
includes a module to detect inbred individuals and estimate their in-
breeding coefficient, a module to describe the proportion of different
mating types in the population and the individual probability to be
offspring of different mating types that can be useful for population
genetic studies. It also allows the identification of shared regions of
homozygosity between affected individuals (homozygosity mapping)
that can be used to identify rare recessive mutations involved in mono-
genic or multifactorial diseases.

Availability and implementation: FSuite is developed in Perl and
uses R functions to generate graphical outputs. This pipeline is
freely available under GNU GPL license at: http://genestat.cephb.fr/

1 INTRODUCTION

Inbreeding is a central concept in genetics. In population studies,
the inbreeding coefﬁcient f of individuals is evaluated to char-
acterize mating habits. In rare disease studies, homozygosity
mapping (Lander and Botstein, 1987) has been widely and
successfully used to localize variants with strong recessive effect
by searching for regions homozygous by descent (HBD) on
pedigrees with inbred cases.

With the availability of dense genome-wide genetic data, it is
now possible to study inbreeding for individuals without genea-
logical information. Several software packages are available to
estimate inbreeding coefﬁcients using genetic data. Some of these
provide single-point estimates of the inbreeding coefﬁcient such
as PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) and Genome-wide Complex Trait

Analysis Wang et al., 2011). Other programs allow the detection
of HBD segments in individuals such as PLINK runs of homo-
zygosity (ROHs), BEAGLE (Browning and Browning, 2010)
and IBDLD (Han and Abney, 2013). However, none of these
applications provides an integrative solution to exploit inbreed-
ing information.

FSuite is a user-friendly pipeline composed of several func-
tions integrating FEstim software (Leutenegger et al., 2003). It
estimates f and proposes population genetic statistics that are not
available in other software, such as detecting inbred individuals
and inferring parental mating types. A homozygosity mapping
statistic with heterogeneity, HFLOD, is proposed, which gives
more importance to HBD segments on individuals with small f
(Leutenegger et al., 2006). With these features, it is easy to
perform the HBD-GWAS strategy (Genin et al., 2012), i.e. homo-
zygosity mapping on inbred cases from genome-wide association
study (GWAS), to detect Mendelian sub-entities of complex
diseases. FSuite also provides graphical outputs to facilitate
interpretations of homozygosity mapping results.

2 METHODS

FSuite needs ﬁles in PLINK format: a ‘map’ and a ‘ped’ ﬁle, or PLINK
binary ﬁles. They should contain genome-wide data for the 22 autosomes.
If the sample is large enough, FSuite can estimate allele frequencies.
Otherwise, frequencies estimated on a reference sample should be fur-
nished in a PLINK ‘frq’ format.

2.1 Creation of random submaps

FEstim uses a hidden Markov model (HMM) to model the HBD process
of an individual. It requires the markers to be in minimal linkage disequi-
librium (LD), which is not the case of actual dense genetic data. Running
FEstim on multiple random sparse genome maps (submaps) has been
proposed to remove LD (Leutenegger et al., 2011). FSuite allows the
creation of such submaps, based on genetic or physical positions.
The default option is to create 100 random submaps from the map ﬁle,
with one marker every 0.5 cm. An alternative option is to randomly select
a marker between recombination hotspots (McVean et al., 2004;
Winckler et al., 2005).

2.2 Population genetic studies

The FEstim model depends on two parameters f and a, where f is the
individual inbreeding coefﬁcient and 1/(a(1-f)) is the expected length of
HBD segments (here cM), that are estimated by maximum likelihood.
When several submaps are considered, FSuite estimates the inbreeding

coefﬁcient as the median value of the f estimates obtained on the different
maps. FSuite also ﬁxes FEstim HMM parameters to compute the
likelihood of different mating types. These likelihoods can be used for
(i) inferring an individual as inbred by comparing the maximized
likelihood with the one to be outbred with a likelihood ratio test, (ii)
estimating the proportion of mating types in a population and (iii)
estimating the probability for an individual to be offspring of different
mating types (Leutenegger et at, 2011). The ones considered in FSuite are
ﬁrst cousin, second cousin, double ﬁrst cousin, avuncular and unrelated.
FSuite outputs the median p-values/probabilities obtained on the multiple
submaps.

2.3 Homozygosity mapping and HBD-GWAS strategy

HBD posterior probabilities and homozygosity mapping score (FLOD)
are calculated per individual at each marker. If a marker is present in
several submaps, then an average of the HBD posterior probabilities and
FLOD is calculated. FSuite accepts single individuals and nuclear
families. Finally, to allow for heterogeneity at a locus, a heterogeneity
FLOD (HFLOD) is maximized over a grid of or values (the proportion of
cases linked to this locus).

By default, FSuite performs these steps on cases previously inferred as
inbred, to remove non-informative outbred individuals for homozygosity
mapping. When applied on GWAS data, this allows to perform HBD-
GWAS strategy directly (Genin et at, 2012).

2.4 Graphical outputs

For a quicker and easier understanding of the results, FSuite produces
some graphical outputs generated with R or Circos (Krzywinski et at,
2009), in addition to text output ﬁles (see Fig. 1 for different examples).
Graphs similar to the ones of Figures 1B and C can also be plotted for
runs of homozygosity detected by PLINK.

2.5 Application to whole exome sequencing data

Using submaps has shown good results on single nucleotide polymorph-
ism (SNP) data. Whole exome sequencing data are now more and more
available but do not uniformly cover the genome. However, we observed
through simulation studies, that FSuite also provides accurate f estimates
when applied to SNP genotypes extracted from exome data
(Supplementary Information).

graph (B), the HBD segments are represented genome-wide as a Circos
plot. The arrow pinpoints chromosome 20, where the maximum HFLOD
is reached. Graph (C) shows the HBD segments for each case on this

2.6 Requirement and documentation

FSuite needs Perl, R and some of its packages, Circos (optional), PLINK
and Merlin (Abecasis et at, 2002) to be installed on the user’s computer.
FSuite pipeline includes a detailed documentation and a simulated ex-
ample dataset. It also includes an example dataset of ﬁve cases affected
with a rare disease genotyped on 180160 SNPs, among whom four
are inbred.

3 DISCUSSION

FSuite is a user-friendly pipeline developed for population
genetic studies, rare disease studies and multifactorial disease
studies. It implements a set of statistics that are not available
in other existing genetic software. It can be used not only on
SNP data but also on whole exome sequencing data. FSuite
does not model LD but takes it into account by using several
sparse submaps. It provides robust results, and can be applied on
small datasets (where modeling LD is not accurate) if reference
allele frequencies are available. In addition, on larger datasets, it
has been shown that this strategy gives less bias than available
single-point estimates, ROH—based estimates and HMMs model-
ing LD (Gazal et at, 2014). FSuite offers the possibility to exploit
inbreeding information derived from genomic data and will help
investigators to better explore their SNP chip and exome data.

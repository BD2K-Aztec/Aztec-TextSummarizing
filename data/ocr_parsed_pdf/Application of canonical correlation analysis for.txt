ABSTRACT

Motivation: Gene therapy aims at using viral vectors for attaching
helpful genetic code to target genes. Therefore, it is of great
importance to develop methods that can discover significant
patterns around viral integration sites. Canonical correlation analysis
is an unsupervised statistical tool that is used to describe the
relations between two related views of the same semantic object,
which fits well for identifying such salient patterns.

Results: Proposed method is demonstrated on a sequence dataset
obtained from a study on HIV-1 preferred integration regions. The
subsequences on the left and right sides of the integration points
are given to the method as the two views, and statistically significant
relations are found between sequence-driven features derived from
these two views, which suggest that the viral preference must be
the factor responsible for this correlation. We found that there are
significant correlations at x25 indicating a palindromic behavior
surrounding the viral integration site, which complies with the
previously reported results.

1 INTRODUCTION

Advances in genome sequencing technologies provided scientists
determine target sites of viruses in human genome. This concept
has brought along an innovative step called ‘gene therapy’. In gene
therapy, connection parts of viruses to genome, which are called
as LTRs (Long Terminal Repeats), are used for linking helpful
genetic code to target gene. However, in order to understand linking
Characteristics of such a vector to a target gene, ﬁrst, a cell of
host genome must be infected with a virus having proper LTR.
This methodology has been applied to one of the most popular
gene therapy Challenges, HIV-1 (Human Immunodeﬁciency Virus
Type-1). Schroder et a1. (2002) infected a human lymphoid cell
line with HIV-l-based vector and obtained 524 Chimeric sites.
After transcriptional proﬁling they showed a correlation between
gene activity and viral insertion preference. A hot spot, covering
a region of 2.5 Kb, was reported to include only 1% of these
s1tes.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

After sequencing phase, virus-speciﬁc patterns (motifs) can arise
in Chimeric sequences. In order to detect such common patterns,
a numerous types of motif search approaches have been proposed.
Hertz et a1. (1999) described a series of components to determine
alignments of multiple sequences. They derived log-likelihood
scoring schemes and then implemented a greedy algorithm for
ﬁnding alignments of functionally related sequences. In another
study, GuhaThakurta et a1. (2001) presented a Gibbs sampling-
based (Lawrence et (11., 1993) method to discover and weigh
binding site patterns in DNA sequences. Holman et a1. (2005)
and Wu et a1. (2005) manually identiﬁed symmetrical/palindromic
behavior between the frequencies of bases on each side of integration
sites in HIV-1 consensus sequences reported by Schroder et al.
(2002). In this study, in order to ﬁnd such common sequence
patterns automatically, we propose a method based on the well-
known statistical tool called ‘Canonical Correlation Analysis’
(CCA).

CCA seeks correlated functions (covariates) of two different, but
related, views (i.e. two sets of related variables; Hardoon et al.,
2004). The availability of such correlated functions of the two
views of the same semantic object is likely to exist due to an
underlying factor responsible for the correlation. In relation to the
problem of ﬁnding patterns around viral integration sites, we are
given DNA sequences targeted by the virus as the semantic object;
two nearby windows placed on each sequence can be used as the
two views, where the fragments falling in windows are represented
by some sequence-driven features such as base/dimer frequencies
or a more sophisticated one such as moment descriptors; and the
correlation of the two functions over these views is expected to
be due to the viral preference as the factor responsible for this
correlation.

CCA has proved to be a powerful method in previous studies
especially in GWAS (Genome Wide Association Studies). Peng
et al. (2010), have proposed a canonical correlation based U
statistic metric to detect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-
based gene—gene co-association in two sample case-control datasets.
They explored its Type-I error rate through simulations on two real
datasets. In another study, Naylor et al. (2010) have implemented
CCA to detect genetic associations between SNPs and gene
expression levels. By this methodology, they Claim to reduce the
amount of necessary comparisons. For large-scale genomic studies,
Parkhomenko et al. (2009) suggested using a sparse implementation
of CCA. They divided their dataset into small subsets of variables
belonging to different types and performed variable selection by
maximizing the correlation between these subsets. CCA-based

analysis can be applied to protein datasets as well, such as for
searching correlated functions between moment-based features,
autocorrelation, composition, transition or distribution (Li et (11.,
2006; Shi et (11., 2006). In this study, adding to this wide variety
of its applications, we utilize CCA in searching viral integration
patterns on the sequences reported by Schroder et (11. (2002).

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Genomic sequence dataset

Schroder et a1. (2002) reported a total number of 688 sequences that
were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers from BH609398 to
BH610085. These sequences are human parts of chimeric sequences oriented
in same direction (5’73’) relative to the Virus. We determined chromosomal
locations regarding 5’ sides (integration point) of these sequences by using
online BLAST (Zhang et (11.. 2000) function of MATLAB (Mathworks)
called ‘blastncbi’. Then from each side of detected locations. 500 bases
belonging to human genome were downloaded using function ‘getgenbank’
that was also present in MATLAB. Downloaded sequences were aligned
according to integration point x :0.

As reported in Schroder et a1. (2002). some of these sequences did not
yield high-quality matching scores to genome and got excluded from the
study. Among remaining ones. we chose a total number of 231 sequences
that match to genome only with ‘plus/plus’ strand. A list of accession numbers
corresponding to the sequences used can be found at the web address given
in ‘Availability’.

2.2 CCA

CCA describes the linear relation between two multidimensional (or two
sets of) variables as the problem of ﬁnding basis vectors for each set such
that the projections of the two variables on their respective basis vectors are
maximally correlated (Hardoon at (11.. 2004; Izenman at (11.. 2008; Kursun
at (11.. 2011). These two sets of variables may correspond to different Views
of the same semantic object. For example. in searching the Viral preference
patterns. these two Views can be taken as the left and right subsequences
next to the integration point. Among the common examples from other
application domains. audio versus Video. binocular Vision. text versus images
in documents can be listed.

Let x and y be two u-dimensional real-valued variables of two sets (x, y e
R“). then the canonical correlation between x and y is deﬁned as:

pa: y) = iupcoanx: gTy) (1)
,8

where. corr(x;y) stands for Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient. If we have N
observations from each set then we can group them in X and Y as X = [x1.

x2.  xN]T and Y = [y1. y2.  yN]T. Here. we can calculate within-sets
(CXX. ny) and between-sets (CH 2 CYXT) covariance matrices as:

We can calculate canonical correlation which is the maximized value of p
with respect to basis sets f and g as seen in Equation 3.

By simply solving the eigenproblem given in Equations 4 and 5. we can

determine projection vectors f and g that results in the maximum correlation

of p(X; Y)=¢X.

2.3 Sequence features

Four sets of sequence features are used: Base Frequency (BF). Dimer
Frequency (DF). Mean Base Position (MBP) and Variance of Mean Base
Positions (VMBP) (Deng at (11.. 2011; Shi et (11.. 2006). We have an alphabet
of bases 01 = {A. C. G. T} and K sequences each with length Lk. Base

where j denotes base position in each sequence. and

’1 0 if 01,» is not present at positionj in sequence k

In a same manner Dimer Frequencies (d?) with alphabet 13 2 {AA. AC. AG.

as:

While forming feature vectors of base (or similarly. dimer frequencies).
due to the linear dependency among them (their sum is equal to 1.0). we
omit one (e.g. the last) feature from the set. Thus. we obtain bk 2 [b]; b51213?

Application of CCA for identifying viral integration preferences

 

2.4 Proposed method for identifying viral integration
preferences

In application of CCA for identifying Viral integration preferences. a pair
of (nearby) windows. as seen in Fig. 1. is placed on fragment bunches. To
represent the sequence fragments in these windows. sequence-driven features
listed in Section 2.3 are extracted. Then the maximal correlation between
functions of these two Views is computed using CCA. Here. we introduce
two parameters: window-width (w) and gap between windows.

Adjusting optimal window width is a heuristic task that we examined with
various values in Section 3. For example. in search of small patterns. small
values for w are needed to be used. On the other hand. choosing w too big
may cause same repetitive regions fall into adjacent windows. This would
yield a high but dummy correlation especially for basic sequence features
like base or dimer frequencies (due to low frequency components). Also
setting the gap too big might lead to lose all local dependencies. yielding no
correlation.

CCA analyses were performed by placing two w-wide windows with a
distance of gap and sliding them in base-by-base manner along x: —500
to +500 region. a total of 1000 bases (excluding x20). This sliding is to
ﬁnd all interesting points in the sequences and also for checking whether
the correlations at a particular point is well above the correlations found
elsewhere. thus. serving as a way of statistically testing the correlation found
in one point with 1000 others. First. on each possible location x. a separate
CCA was trained to ﬁnd maximally correlated functions of used features
between the two input windows placed on the training set. Then. the extracted
functions were tested on test set to check whether the correlation was truly
present.

For developing the analysis programs. we used MATLAB with its
bioinformatics toolbox and CCA implementation of (Borga at (11.. 2001).

3 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In its current implementation, the proposed method requires two
predetermined parameters (windows size and gap between windows)
and utilizes four sets of sequence-driven features (see ‘Materials and
Methods’ section for details). Depending on the viral preference
pattern of interest, these parameters need to be adjusted and the
correct type of features set (or feature set combinations) should be
Chosen. The genomic sequence dataset of (Schroder et (11., 2002) was
used in order to demonstrate the potential of the proposed method
in identifying viral integration preferences. For statistical validation,
the dataset was randomly split into two halves (with 116 and 115
fragments) to obtain the training and the test sets. For 5 X 2 cross-
validation, we repeated this process ﬁve times and used each half
once for training and once for testing. The training set was used for
learning the correlated functions and the test set was used to check
whether these correlations (viral preference patterns) still hold on
unseen fragments.

As the dataset has been used in previous work reporting short
segments of weak palindromic behavior near the integration sites
(Holman et (11., 2005; Wu et (11., 2005), we used small window
sizes (w) and negative gaps. Using a negative gap means the two
windows overlap and the non-overlapping portions of the windows
would account for the palindromic behavior. For such a small dataset
and short window-width considered, the best Choices of sequence-
features were base and dimer frequencies. Using just the base
frequencies, as seen in Table 1 and in Figs 2 and 3, for small windows
with w=2 and w=4, high and signiﬁcant correlations of 0.74 and

example, for w=2 and gap =—1, we have one window on the
[x— 1, x] base-interval and the other one on [x, x+ 1]. We avoided
the use of high degree k-mers because of their high dimensionality;
e. g. there are 64 trimers, which can be considered high-dimensional
given that there are only 116 samples in the training set). Moreover,
when searching for larger patterns with larger windows, the moment
features can also be utilized.

In order to make sure that these correlations found are not
ordinary elsewhere, we applied z-test (Sprinthall, 2003) on them
against the correlations obtained from all possible positions from
X: —500 to X: +500. Increasing the window width results in loss
of signiﬁcance of the correlations (as seen in Fig. 4); implying that
the symmetrical behavior has a short span as stated in (Holman

signiﬁcant ﬁndings in this dataset.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We present a novel application of CCA for investigating common
patterns near viral integration sites in genome. CCA is an
unsupervised statistical tool that can ﬁnd correlated ﬁmctions over
different sets of variables, in its application to genome, the two
sets can be sequence features extracted from adjacent windows
placed on target sequences. The existence of such covariate ﬁmctions
over these separate windows is expected to be due to the viral
preference as the factor responsible for this correlation. In particular,
in this study, CCA is demonstrated and tested on the integration site
sequences given by Schroder et (11. (2002). The method successfully
ﬁnds signiﬁcant viral preferences near the integration point similar
to results reported by Wu et (11. (2005). More speciﬁcally, it has been
found that at x: 5, there are signiﬁcant correlations (with P < 0.05)
for various values of window size and gap parameters.

In the proposed method, there are three major parameters that
affect the correlation between two windows: (i) sequence features
used: base/dimer frequencies, moment descriptors, etc.; (ii) the
window width (small widths for short patterns and vice versa);
and (iii) gap between windows (positive for non-overlapping and
negative for overlapping windows). Depending on the dataset used,
the optimal choices for these parameters may change. For example,
in order to search for short patterns, base or dimer frequencies is
more suitable with small window width and gap as in the HIV-1
dataset used in our study. On the other hand, for structural similarities
where correlations between more distant areas are important (Shi
et (11., 2006) moment features may be preferred.

Especially with better features such as trimers and moment-
based features, the proposed method can be used in searching more
complex and longer patterns. New sequence features can be easily

ABSTRACT

Summary: JEPE'I'I'O (Java Enrichment of Pathways Extended To
TOpoIogy) is a Cytoscape 3.x plugin performing integrative human
gene set analysis. It identifies functional associations between genes
and known cellular pathways, and processes using protein interaction
networks and topological analysis. The plugin integrates information
from three separate web servers we published previously, specializing
in enrichment analysis, pathways expansion and topological matching.
This integration substantially simplifies the analysis of user gene sets
and the interpretation of the results. We demonstrate the utility of the
JEPEI'I'O plugin on a set of misregulated genes associated with
Alzheimer’s disease.

Availability: Source code and binaries are freely available for down-
load at http://apps.cytoscape.org/appsﬂepetto, implemented in Java
and multi-platform. Installable directly via Cytoscape plugin manager.

1 INTRODUCTION

The integration of heterogeneous data derived from functional
genomics experiments is an essential step in providing insights
into biological systems behaviour, especially disease-related pro-
cesses. Nowadays this integration is becoming easier, thanks to
extendable network analysis platforms such as Cytoscape
(Shannon et al., 2003). Although several existing Cytoscape plu-
gins do functional analysis, not many go beyond performing a
‘term-based’ search or link ontology. In contrast, JEPETTO in-
tegrates gene sets with pathways and the molecular interaction
networks they are embedded in. It uses information from three
different web servers to perform network enrichment, pathways
expansion and topological analysis.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Input

Our plugin operates on target gene set provided by a user. The
list of gene names can be given directly or imported from an

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

existing network created in Cytoscape (many gene identiﬁer
formats are accepted, e.g. Ensembl, HGNC, Entrez, Um'Prot).
The other main parameters are the reference annotation data-
base (KEGG, BioCarta, G0, InterPro, etc.) and the molecular
interaction network (STRING or a user-deﬁned network).

2.2 Processing

There are two types of analysis available in JEPETTO based on:
(1) enrichment or (2) topology. For the enrichment analysis,
EnrichNet and PathExpand web servers are used and the topo-
logical analysis is performed with TopoGSA. The plugin commu-
nicates with the web servers as shown in Figure 1A, and
integrates the results within the Cytoscape environment. This
single-point integration eliminates the need to use the web servers
individually and simpliﬁes repeated analysis on previously ob-
tained results.

EnrichNet (Glaab et al., 2012) maps the input gene set onto a
molecular interaction network and, using a random walk, scores
distances between the genes and pathways/processes in a refer-
ence database. This network-based association score (XD-score)
is relative to the average distance to all pathways and represents
a deviation (positive or negative) from the average distance. As
an option, EnrichNet provides XD-scores for 60 human tissues,
derived from tissue-speciﬁc gene expression data.

PathExpand (Glaab et al., 2010a) maps the input pathway/pro-
cess onto the human proteiniprotein interaction network and
extends it with proteins that (1) are strongly associated with the
pathway nodes; and (2) increase the pathway compactness by
connecting its disconnected members. The exact expansion ac-
ceptance criteria can be modiﬁed in the plugin advanced options.

TopoGSA (Glaab et al., 2010b) maps the input gene set on an
interaction network, computes its topological signature and com-
pares it against signatures of pathways/processes in a reference
database. The topological signature is built from ﬁve distinct

lap between them. Orange nodes represent the expansion. Interactions
between the input set and added nodes are highlighted: edges to pathway
nodes are green and edges to expansion nodes are orange

properties, among others: network density, centrality of nodes in
the network or their tendency to form clusters.

2.3 Output

The enrichment analysis ﬁnds pathways signiﬁcantly associated
with the input gene set (in terms of XD-score). When a pathway
is selected, its expansion is constructed and a network of inter-
actions between the gene set, pathway and expansion is gener-
ated (see Fig. 2). The topology analysis ﬁnds pathways with a
pattern of interactions most similar to those in the input gene set
and Visually compares their topological properties (see Fig. 3).

3 CASE STU DY

We have retrieved the Alzheimer’s disease-related set of genes
from Phenopedia (http://www.hugenavigator.net). The enrich-
ment analysis of this set assigned the highest XD-score (1.94)
to the Alzheimer’s disease pathway. The pathway was expanded
and the disease environmental network (see Fig. 2) was gener-
ated. The following genes were added as the expansion:
TMEDIO, METTLZB, APHIB, MMPI7 and PITX3.

The first three of these genes have been experimentally char-
acterized as direct Alzheimer’s cofactors (additional details in
Supplementary Information). MMPI7 protein family was
found to play a role in ﬂ-amyloid proteins degradation related
to the increase of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the
main trigger of the Alzheimer’s disease Woshiyama et al., 2000).
PITX3 is involved in transcription of a micro-RNA that is
known to have reduced expression levels in Parkinson’s diseased
brains and may also contribute to the Alzheimer’s pathology
development (Shioya et al., 2010).

The topological analysis of the largest connected component
of the Alzheimer’s disease environmental network conﬁrmed the
previous findings. Among the most topologically similar path-
ways were Wnt signalling pathway related to MMPI7 and
Parkinson’s disease pathway related to PITX3. It also high-
lighted similarity to sclerosis and diabetes and several environ-
mental information processing pathways (see Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Information).

4 SUMMARY

JEPETTO integrates three different network-centric human gene
set analysis methods under a single interface of the Cytoscape 3.x
environment. It performs enrichment and topological analysis
based on the interaction networks. It displays the target gene
set within its interaction environment and identiﬁes possible
gene cofactors and topologically related pathways and processes
that are unlikely to be detected using traditional term-based
analysis.

In the case study of the Alzheimer’s disease-associated genes,
JEPETTO was able to identify a number of known disease co-
factors and suggested directions for further investigation.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The field of structural bioinformatics and computational
biophysics has undergone a revolution in the last 10 years.
Developments that are captured annually through the SDSIG meeting,
upon which this article reflects.

Results: An increase in the accessible data, computational resources
and methodology has resulted in an increase in the size and resolution
of studied systems and the complexity of the questions amenable to
research. Concomitantly, the parameterization and efficiency of the
methods have markedly improved along with their cross-validation
with other computational and experimental results.

Conclusion: The field exhibits an ever-increasing integration with bio-
chemistry, biophysics and other disciplines. In this article, we discuss
recent achievements along with current challenges within the field.

1 INTRODUCTION

Structural bioinformatics, originally known as structural compu-
tational biology, predates other forms of bioinformatics. It can
be argued that the seminal 1953 article by Watson and Crick
(Watson and Crick, 1953) is in fact a modeling paper and argu-
ably the first structural bioinformatics paper. Thus, the 2014
Nobel prize for ‘multiscale modeling’ to Martin Karplus, Arie
Warshel and Michael Levitt marks an important hallmark
acknowledging the impact of structural bioinformatics on sci-
ence. In his account of the birth of the ﬁeld, Levitt (2001) de-
scribes how computation was required to accurately reﬁne the
tRNA model predicted by Crick in building an actual model that
was taller than himself. Thus, computation has been an integral
part of structural biology from its early days and has had an
ever-increasing role in biochemistry and molecular biology with
the passing of years. Indeed, from the first simulations of small
systems and a few picoseconds acknowledged by the Nobel com-
mittee, we are now at a stage where millisecond simulations
(Beauchamp et al., 2011) or massive searches of sequence and
structure space as required for, e. g. computational protein design
(Gu and Bourne, 2011; Kiss et al., 2013; Samish et al., 2011) are
achievable.

Structural bioinformatics or structural computational biology,
broadly deﬁned, is a ﬁeld at the intersection between computer
science, physics, chemistry and molecular biology. Historically,
the term ‘structural bioinformatics’ describes data-driven statis-
tical, knowledge-based research of representative non-redundant

ensembles of structures to understand the statistical behavior of
the system under investigation. Alternatively, ‘computational
biophysics’ describes a hypothesis-driven physics-based treat-
ment of biological molecular systems. The ergodic hypothesis
guarantees that conclusions from the two types of approaches
converge over large non-redundant samples or long simulations
(Samish, 2009). Currently, numerous methodologies employ
ideas from both approaches. Consequently, hereafter we will
refer to both as structural bioinformatics.

Biologically, structural bioinformatics aims to understand the
factors that inﬂuence and determine the function of biological
macromolecules, the interplay between evolution, kinetics and
thermodynamics, the determinants of speciﬁcity and selectivity
in molecular interactions, the dynamic aspects of macromolecu-
lar structures and their effect on function and stability and, ﬁ-
nally, the ability to use all these for engineering, design and
biotechnology. In fact, a complete understanding of biological
processes must inescapably pass through an understanding of the
factors inﬂuencing such processes at the atomic and sometimes
even subatomic levels. In this article, we discuss some of the most
notable achievements in structural bioinformatics over the past
10 years and discuss existing challenges in the field. Without a
doubt, the topics and the speciﬁc articles mentioned here are
biased by the opinion of the authors.

2 ACHIEVEMENTS

Some of the numerous achievements in the field in the last
10 years include the following (Fig. 1).

2.1 Data coverage and community resources

The human genome sequencing revolution marks the availability
of sequence data at scale. The realization that sequence alone is
not enough to understand/predict function led to the establish-
ment of large structural genomics initiatives where the structure
of proteins with low sequence similarity to proteins with known
structures were targeted to increase the coverage of fold space
and permit more accurate fold recognition, threading and hom-
ology modeling (Baker and Sali, 2001). In the last decade, the
number of structures deposited in the protein data bank (PDB)
(Berman et al., 2000) grew 4-fold to over 100,000 structures
including an unprecedented number of membrane protein struc-
tures. The PDBione of the ﬁrst biological databasesiand
derived resources such as CATH (Sillitoe et al., 2013), SCOP
(Andreeva et al., 2008) and PFAM (Finn et al., 2014) are

fundamental enabling tools for the entire ﬁeld and their long-
term maintenance is of great importance to the ﬁeld.

2.2 Computational power

The increased availability of computer power has enabled appli-
cations that were beyond imagining just a few years ago.
Dedicated hardware [e.g. ANTON (Shaw et £11., 2009) at DE
Shaw Research designed uniquely for molecular dynamics simu-
lations], the use of graphical processing units (Friedrichs et £11.,
2009) or distributed crowd sourcing with the BOINC interface
(Anderson, 2004) [e.g. Folding@home (Shirts and Pande, 2000)]
vastly increased the reach of current methods. An exciting devel-
opment is the involvement of interested laypeople as active prob-
lem solvers such as in the Foldit game (Cooper et £11., 2010).

2.3 Objective method assessment

The CASP critical assessment of protein structure prediction
began a new era in the ﬁeld providing an objective double
blind test for structure prediction methods (Moult et £11., 2014)
with other areas following suit: protein interactions (Janin et £11.,
2003), function prediction (Radivojac et £11., 2013), membrane
protein docking (Kufareva et £11., 2014) or automated structure
prediction (Bourne, 2003). This also led to meta-prediction meth-
ods (Ginalski et £11., 2003) and community collaborations, e.g.
WeFold (Khoury et £11., 2014).

2.4 Correlated mutations and modeling protein structure

Correlated mutation data have enabled the generation of pairwise
amino acid contact maps from sequence data (Marks et £11., 2011;
Nugent and Jones, 2012). Such contact maps are then used as

spatial constraints to generate models of globular and membrane
proteins. In the cases where enough sequence data allow the use of
this methodology, a high level of accuracy has been achieved.

2.5 Chemical systems biology

Also known as systems pharmacology, the integration of the vast
amounts of ‘omics’ data with accessible structural methods such
as the detection of binding site similarities (Kurbatova et al.,
2013; Xie et al., 2011a) can be used for drug repositioning and
discovery (Chang et al., 2010; Kinnings et al., 2009; Xie et al.,
2011b, 2014).

2.6 Small-molecule docking simulations

Docking simulations (Brooijmans and Kuntz, 2003; Halperin
et al., 2002) are widely used (Kitchen et al., 2004; Warren
et al., 2006). Predicted ligand protein complex structures are
then used to generate hypotheses about binding and for virtual
screening in the early stages of drug design.

3 CHALLENGES

Although considerable progress has been made, advances are still
needed in the following areas (Fig. 1).

3.1 Modeling large or multi-domain proteins and
assemblies

Most proteins are large and multi-domain and take part in
complex assemblies requiring fine-tuned recognition (Chothia
and Janin, 1975; Jones and Thornton, 1996; Levy et al., 2008).
Examples include large complexes such as the ribosome Wonath,
2010) and the proteasome (Adams, 2003) or supercomplexes
such as the 60-subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (Patel
et al., 2014). Most of cell biology requires understanding the
interplay of such large multi-domain proteins and complexes
and lacks the level of detail that comes from atomic-level struc-
tural information. Targeting such complexes and assemblies ex-
perimentally and looking at them in the context of the complete
cell is an emergent challenge.

3.2 Biomolecules as dynamic objects

The accurate modeling of large conformational changes due
to ligand binding, allosteric effects, post-translational modiﬁca-
tions or as the result of proteiniprotein interactions is essential.
Techniques such as molecular dynamics (Adcock and
McCammon, 2006) and elastic network models (Bahar and
Rader, 2005; Frappier and Najmanovich, 2014) provide two
techniques at different granularities. Descriptions of biomol-
ecules representing the conformational ensembles in which they
are found under physiological conditions will expand our under-
standing of the relationship between structure and function. The
use of such conformational ensembles as opposed to single static
structures is challenging for complex structures.

3.3 Modeling 3D RNA structures

The prediction of RNA structures is still in its infancy (Laing and
Schlick, 2010; Rother et al., 2011) and often requires processing

low-resolution data (Parisien and Major, 2012). With simpliﬁed
rules for molecular interactions in RNA when compared with
proteins, we should be able to model larger and more complex
RNA molecules than currently possible.

3.4 Small differences may have drastic effects

Although protein structure is resilient to mutation (Baase et al.,
2010), function is not necessarily as resilient (Najmanovich eta1.,
2008; Rajamani et al., 2004). This combination of structural ro-
bustness and functional plasticity is at the core of evolutionary
change. It is essential that we learn to recognize and accordingly
weigh such functional determinants to predict the outcome of
natural or engineered perturbations at the molecular level. In
particular, the prediction of function is based on the detection
of similarities (Najmanovich et al., 2005) where small differences
are ignored. One needs to only look at the existence of vast
protein families performing the ‘same’ function to realize that
we do not fully understand the effect of small differences.
Some of these differences are likely required to modulate select-
ivity rather than speciﬁcity within the different cellular (or
temporal) contexts where the same function is required
(Najmanovich et al., 2008). This level of understanding will re-
quire the integration between structural and systems biology.

3.5 Integration with systems biology

Beyond the detection of cross-reactivity targets to a given drug
and the impact on the complete system, a full understanding of
speciﬁcity and selectivity at the molecular level requires studying
all macromolecules that are sharing the crowded (Ellis, 2001;
McGuffee and Elcock, 2010; Minton, 1993) cellular milieu.
Computationally understanding a full cell from a structural
point of view is a major challenge. A full structural understand-
ing of a living cell at all scales (Stein et al., 2007), integrating
macromolecules at atomic resolution all the way to phenotypes is
still missing and once achieved will deﬁne a new era in biology
(Hallock et al., 2014; Peterson et al., 2014; Winter et al., 2012).

3.6 Protein engineering and synthetic biology

Protein engineering of single proteins (Kiss et al., 2013) and pro-
teiniprotein interfaces (Potapov et al., 2008) is an advancing
field, in particular with the success of Rosetta (Rohl et al.,
2004) and the advent of a whole generation of ‘Rosetta
Engineers’ (The term was heard at the Protein Engineering
Canada 2014 conference but the author is unknown.)
However, computational protein design (Samish et al., 2011)
and enzyme redesign (Gerlt and Babbitt, 2009) are still restricted
by the complexity of the sequence and structure search space.
The approximations that are needed to tackle this complexity
often require a choice of simpliﬁed methods that all but ignore
atomic structure. Speciﬁcally, side-chain placement, iterative
homology modeling (Q. Wang eta1., 2008) and ﬂexible backbone
sampling (Ollikainen et al., 2013) remain major challenges.
Lastly, synthetic biology (Way et al., 2014) promises to extend
biological systems well beyond what is naturally observed and its
integration with computational drug design (Marchisio and
Stelling, 2009; Tew et al., 2010) and structural bioinformatics
will open new and exciting possibilities.

Achievements and challenges in structural bioinformatics and computational biophysics

 

3.7 Origins and evolution of protein structure

Is fold space discrete or continuous? If discreet, why are some
folds so much more common than others? Have we identiﬁed
nearly all possible folds? How do new folds appear? All these
questions have been partially addressed but deﬁnitive answers
still remain illusive.

3.8 Protein folding

The biggest challenge in structural bioinformatics remains un-
solved. That is, the ability to consistently predict the structure
of a protein based solely on its amino acid sequence. The
Levinthal paradox inspires us to continue. Thus, although con-
formational space is so immense as to be intractable, proteins do
fold, leading to a variety of advances based on different ways of
addressing the paradox (Dill and Chan, 1997; Karplus, 1997;
Wolynes et al., 1995). However, we are far from solving the
protein folding problem and arguably progress is based more
on existing structures than ﬁrst principles.

3.9 Accessibility and integration of data and methods

Data, methods and publications must be open (Masum et al.,
2013) and reproducible (Sandve et al., 2013). One success of the
ﬁeld has been the number of mature open source software.
Widely used software includes CCP4 for macromolecular struc-
ture determination and refinement (Potterton et al., 2004),
CHARMM (Hynninen and Crowley, 2014), NAMD W. Wang
et al., 2011) and GROMACS (Pronk et al., 2013) for molecular
dynamics, Modeller (Eswar et al., 2007) for homology modeling
and Rosetta (Rohl et al., 2004) for structure prediction and
design. One challenge for the future is how to make the plethora
of existing methods accessible to newcomers in the field and to
the scientiﬁc community at large. Just as one cannot publish a
structure or a sequence without submitting the data to a public
repository, methods and data must be stored in repositories that
guarantee their accessibility to the community immediately at the
time of publication. The availability of data and methods will
help ensure reproducibility and cross-validation.

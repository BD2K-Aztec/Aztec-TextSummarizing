unmapped reads or local alignment approaches, but they do not
handle reads mapped to incorrect loci. Although lobSTR
(Gymrek et al., 2012) has been developed to proﬁle short
tandem repeat loci using its own alignment approach, it is limited
to only analyzing 276—mer motif repeat loci. To overcome the
difficulty of variant calling at STR loci in a bacterial genome, we
applied an iterative backbone remapping and assembly method
to generate the genome sequence of bacterial field isolates and to
call their correct variants (Tae et al., 2012b). The method has
successfully detected INDEL variants including tandem repeat
variants shorter than the read length, but is not applicable to
eukaryotic genomes because many variants at diploid genomes
are heterozygous. Analysis of heterozygous STR variants is even
more challenging compared with SNPs or short INDELs
because two different non—reference alleles are frequently dis—
covered from an STR locus and the alleles at the STR locus
can be different between individuals (Edwards et al., 1991).
Here, we describe ReviSTER (Revise Simple Tandem repeat
Error Reads), which is an automated pipeline using a ‘local map—
ping reference reconstruction method’ to revise mismapped
(mapped to incorrect position) or partially misaligned (mapped
to correct position but one of ends misaligned) reads at STR loci.
It takes FASTQ—formatted ﬁles, a reference sequence ﬁle and a list
ﬁle containing STR locations as inputs and uses BWA as an initial
mapping program. It subsequently realigns reads unmapped by
BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) using BLAT (Kent, 2002), and con—
ducts local assembly with all aligned reads to an STR locus. From
the local assembled result, new local mapping reference sequences
are generated, and all mapped reads containing more than one
mismatch in their alignments and unmapped reads are mapped
again to the new local mapping references. Reads mapped to the
local mapping references are relocated to the original reference
and compared with the original alignments to choose the
best alignment. The performance of ReviSTER was compared
with two mapping programs, including BWA and Bowtie2
(Langmead and Salzberg, 2012), and a realignment program,
GATK (McKenna et al., 2010), using three different test datasets.

2 METHODS

2.1 Six steps to revise mismapping and misalignment

ReviSTER is a PERL program and uses three programs including BWA,
BLAT and SAMTools (Li et al., 2009) installed in the user’s environment.
RevisTER takes FASTQ-formatted ﬁles, a FASTA-formatted reference
sequence ﬁle and an optional ﬁle containing a list of STR locations as
inputs (Supplementary Note ‘ReviSTER manual’). If the STR location
ﬁle is not submitted, it searches for STR loci from the reference ﬁle
(Supplementary Methods). ReviSTER uses a novel approach called a
‘local mapping reference reconstruction method’ to revise mismapping
and misalignment of sequence reads derived from the STR loci (Fig. 1).
The whole process to revise the read alignments is composed of six steps.
The ﬁrst step is to map reads to a reference sequence using BWA.
ReviSTER takes the ‘-n’ option, which is used for BWA mapping to
record multiple mapping candidates for reads derived from repeat
sequences. Next, BLAT is used to remap unmapped reads to temporary
reference sequences, which are extracted from the original reference
sequence only around a given STR loci. Because BLAT generates
many false alignments for a read, ReviSTER realigns them and chooses
the best alignment from several alignment candidates (See ‘Remapping
unmapped reads using BLAT’). Third, ReviSTER employs a local

assembly step using the reads mapped to each STR locus. It generates
paths in a graph of reads overlapping at least 30 bases with each other,
chooses a given number of paths corresponding to allele candidates, ex-
tracts sequences of the allele candidates and creates local mapping refer-
ence sequences containing the allele candidates (see ‘Local mapping
reference reconstruction using a local assembly’). In this step, sequence
reads containing more than one mismatch/INDEL bases or showing ab-
normally long pair distances are saved in a separated ﬁle along with
unmapped reads. Fourth, the reads saved in the separate ﬁle are
mapped to the local mapping reference sequences by BWA (with the -n
option). Fifth, mapping positions of a read on the local mapping refer-
ence sequences are converted to positions on the original reference. Then
a mapping position with the most optimal pair distance and the lowest
mismatch number is chosen among all mapping candidates identiﬁed in
the ﬁrst step and the ﬁfth step (see ‘Selecting an optimized mapping
position’). The ﬁnal step is to revise reads partially misaligned to STR
loci, which is an independent process from the previous steps. Some reads
may have been incorrectly aligned to the STR loci containing long
INDELs and not be revised by the previous steps. The reads are realigned
to another read that has been mapped to the same STR locus and sufﬁ-
ciently span the ﬂanking sequences of the locus (see ‘Realignment of
partially misaligned reads’).

2.2 Remapping unmapped reads using BLAT

When the allele length of an STR locus is different from a reference,
sequence reads containing the allele often fail to be mapped because
mapping programs give large negative alignment penalties for long
INDELs. To remap the unmapped reads to STR loci, ReviSTER creates
temporary reference sequences, which are extracted from the original
reference around STR loci. Each temporary reference sequence includes
‘max. read length-10’ base left ﬂanking sequence, STR sequence and
‘max. read length-10’ base right ﬂanking sequence. BLAT [with option
‘-maxIntron= max (50, max. read length-15) ’] is used to map the reads
unmapped by BWA. BLAT searches multiple mapping position candi-
dates for a single query and provides multiple alignment blocks for each
mapping candidate. Because many STR loci share the same motifs and
their ﬂanking sequences often exhibit high similarities, many of the
BLAT alignments are false positives. Additionally, if a read does not
include sufﬁcient ﬂanking sequence length at both the ends of an STR
locus, BLAT may produce a partial misalignment. ReviSTER realigns
each alignment by assigning a low mismatch penalty to INDELs in the
STR locus to correct the partial misalignment (Supplementary Fig. S5). It
assigns 1 as the mismatch penalty score for any individual mismatch or
INDEL bases in ﬂanking sequences but does not assign a penalty of more
than 2 to any INDEL event in the STR locus regardless its length.
ReviSTER then chooses a mapping position candidate producing the
lowest mismatch score for the read.

Because ReviSTER uses the sequences only around STR loci as map-
ping reference sequences, there is still a high probability that the positions
of the reads mapped by BLAT are incorrect. This problem is reduced by
the local mapping reference reconstruction and remapping steps as
follows.

2.3 Local mapping reference reconstruction using a local
assembly

Most mapping programs assign higher penalty to a gap opening than a
mismatch. This frequently leads to the partial misalignment of a read
mapped to the STR locus. As the length of an INDEL at the locus
gets longer, there is less chance for the read containing the INDEL to
be correctly aligned. Also, when two or more STR loci contain the same
motif repeat sequences and their variants are signiﬁcantly different from
the reference, mapping programs tend to map a read to a position produ-
cing the smallest number of mismatch/INDEL bases instead of mapping

include read sequences corresponding to the reference from seven bases
upstream to seven bases downstream of the STR and are not duplicated,
are created. And each read in the second group is aligned to the template
sequences from seven bases upstream of the 3’ end of the STR. Then, a
template sequence producing the smallest number of mismatch bases in
their alignment is selected as an alignment template for the read and the
old alignment for the read is replaced by the new alignment estimated
from the alignment template. The reads in the third group are also aligned
to the template sequences corresponding to the reference from the 5’ end
to seven bases downstream of the STR and their alignments are revised.

This ﬁnal local alignment step can be replaced by GATK using
‘-GATK’ option.

2.6 Test sets

To evaluate the performance of ReviSTER, we created a simulated dataset
and also used sequence datasets from Brucella suis 1330 and human gen-
omes. The ﬁrst dataset was simulated data created as sequence reads of a
single individual diploid genome. To evaluate the performance of
ReviSTER for sequence reads mapped to STR loci near replicated regions
such as transposon elements, we created ﬁve subsets including different
references with N = {1, 3, 10, 15, 20} by placing the same 400 base sequences
on the left sides of N STR loci consisting of the same motifs (Supplementary
Fig. S7A). For each subset, the reference sequence was created from human
chromosome 1 (build 37) after removing all repeat sequences identiﬁed by
RepeatMasker (http://repeatmasker.org). Then 31 types of 178-mer motifs
were used to generate 31 X 3 X N STR loci with 15784 bases ($55 repeats
of a motif in the sequence) in length, each of which was inserted every 1400
bases (400 bases as a replicated sequence on the left side and 1000 bases as a
unique sequence on the right side of the STR sequence). To create sequence
reads, two allele sequences for each STR locus, of which lengths were ran-
domly selected within 127120 bases, were created and inserted into 210 base
DNA fragment sequences completely covering the STR sequence
(Supplementary Fig. S7B). The 210 base DNA fragment sequences con-
taining each allele were created every two bases on the reference sequence.
While the DNA fragment at the left-most side spanned the left two bases of
the right ﬂanking sequence of the STR locus, the fragment at the right-most
side spanned the right two bases of the left ﬂanking sequence. Then 100
base sequences at both the ends of the fragment sequences were used as
paired-end sequencing reads (Supplementary Fig. S7C). About 3% of al-
leles were longer than 90 bases, lengths of which are difﬁcult to analyze with
100 base sequence reads.

To test the performance with haploid genomes, the second dataset was
created from the sequencing data (SRA: SRA056338) (sequenced by
Illumina 76 cycle paired-end protocols) of 3.31411? VBI22 (Tae et al.,
2012a), which is a gram negative bacteria having two chromosomes. Its
genome has 11 loci containing 8-mer tandem repeats (more than or equal
to three motif copies), which are highly variable. The left ﬂanking se-
quences of ﬁve loci among them contain highly similar 90 base sequences
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Because the average sequence coverage of the
original raw dataset was approximately 1000>< , we reduced the number of
reads by randomly selecting 8213 000 sequencing read pairs (16426000
reads). The genome sequence of 3.31411? 1330 (Tae et al., 2011) was used as
a reference sequence and an STR list ﬁle was created with eleven 8-mer
STR loci from the reference. Because the completed genome sequences of
both strains have been published, the allele lengths of each STR locus in
both genomes are known. The other STR loci containing 177-mer motifs
were also compared but there were no loci showing differences between
the two genomes except three G-homopolymer loci. But the G-homopo-
lymer loci were not included in the list ﬁle because the sequence coverage
for the loci was low.

The third dataset was created from the four exon-targeted sequence
sets of human genomes, HG00641 (SRA: SRR107085), HG01105 (SRA:
ERR034575), NA06994 (SRA: SRR070528, SRR070819) and NA19153
(SRA: SRR070660, SRR070846), downloaded from the 1000 genome

project Web site (http: //www.1000genomes.org). Exon-targeted sequence
data were selected to obtain sufﬁcient read coverage at STR loci, and the
human genome NCBI build 37 was used as a reference sequence for
mapping. To create a list of STR loci, TRF v4.04 (Benson, 1999) (with
‘2 7 5 80 10 14 6’ options) was used to search for repeat sequences
including incomplete repeat sets. When two STR loci were within 30
bases, they were merged into one locus; and loci containing at least 10
bases for l-mer, 12 bases for 2-mer and 15 bases for 3,4,5,6-mer of pure
repeat sequences (resulting 1 418 122 loci); and shorter than 90 bases were
selected (1373 574 loci). Then the 30 base ﬂanking sequences on both
sides of each locus were extracted and mapped as single-end reads by
BWA to the human reference sequence. Among the selected STR loci, the
loci of which at least one ﬂanking sequence was assigned the highest
BWA mapping score (Phred score 37) were selected, which resulted
1362 903 loci. Among them, 8652 loci overlapping with exon regions
(Supplementary Table S6), which had been used for exon targeted
sequencing in the 1000 genome project, were obtained.

The fourth dataset was composed of two sequence datasets from blood
and saliva samples from a single human individual (SRA: SRR345592,
SRA: SRR345593) (Illumina 101 cycle paired-end sequencing), which
contained 1499021500 and 1692 395618 reads, respectively. We used
1 362903 STR loci for this test.

For the ﬁnal test to compare the genotyping performance before and
after ReviSTER revised misaligned reads, NCBI release_5_30 of
Drosophila melanogaster was used as a reference genome sequence and
simulated sequence reads for the Drosophila reference sequence were
generated by pIRS (Hu et al., 2012) (Supplementary Results
‘Genotyping test with simulated data generated by pIRS from the
Drosophila reference’ for detail).

3 RESULTS

BWA (v0.6.1), Bowtie2 (v2.0.0) and GATK (v1.&9) were used
for the performance comparison. For BWA and Bowtie2, default
options were used to map sequence reads to reference sequences.
For GATK, which realigned the results of two mapping pro—
grams, options ‘—T IndelRealigner —targetIntervals’ with interval
ﬁles that contained positions of target STR loci were used.
ReviSTER used BWA (v0.6.1) and BLAT (v34) as initial map—
ping programs.

3.1 Performance test with simulated data

Because STR loci are frequently discovered at heads or tails of
long repeat sequences such as transposon elements, we created
ﬁve subsets containing different reference sequences with N: {1,
3, 10, 15, 20} by placing the same 400 bases on the left sides of N
STR loci to test ReviSTER’s performance for the STR loci near
replicated regions (Supplementary Fig. S7). Paired—end sequence
reads of a single individual diploid genome were created for each
reference (See ‘Test sets’) and mapped by ReviSTER (with
option ‘—n 10 —p 2’), BWA (two different mapping with default
options and ‘—e 90 —E 1’ options) and Bowtie2. The BWA options
‘—e 90 —E 1’ allow alignments with long gap extension. Then
mapped reads using BWA and Bowtie2 were realigned by
GATK. To test the performance of the programs with single—
end sequence reads, reads were also mapped as single—end reads
by the programs and their mapping positions were compared.
Because the exact alignment position of each read was known,
the aligned reads were categorized into four groups including
‘unmapped’, ‘mismapped’, ‘partially misaligned’ and ‘correctly
aligned’. When both end positions of a read alignment were

detected abundant mismatches at the regions. Bowtie2 aligned
reads incorrectly most frequently among three programs because
it gave high strength to aligned bases instead of clipping the
mismatch abundant alignment ends. ReviSTER did not detect
the correct allele from only one locus because that allele length in
B.suis VBI22 was 73 bases, which was close to the raw read
length (76 bases).

3.3 Human exome sequencing data

Exon—targeted sequence reads of four human genomes
(HG00641, HG01105, NA06994 and NA19153) were down-
loaded from the 1000 genome project site (http://www.
1000genomes.org). To compare the alignment results from
before and after revision by ReviSTER, we mapped reads
using BWA with an option —n 10 (default for the other options)
using two different mapping methods including PE and SE. Then
ReviSTER used each BWA alignment ﬁle (SAM) as an input to
revise reads mapped to 8652 STR loci.

Approximately 94% of the targeted STR loci were completely
covered by at least two reads, which spanned at least five bases of
both ﬂanking sequences of the loci (We analyzed only reads
spanning at least ﬁve bases of both ﬂanking sequences to
reduce false positives in this test). Because allele candidates for
most loci showed few differences from reference alleles
(Supplementary Fig. S10), ReviSTER did not revise most read
alignments for the alleles. On average 24516 reads at 1507 loci
from PE results and 15041 reads at 1415 loci from SE results
were revised, respectively (Table 2; for additional exome data,
Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). ReviSTER revised more read
alignments when PE was used. The numbers of affected loci and

revised read alignments were proportional to the length of
sequence reads.

Because it was difﬁcult, given that there is no ‘gold standard’,
to distinguish true—positive alleles from false—positive alleles for
STR loci from human genome sequence data, we assumed that
the results of PE approaches would contain more potentially true
positives than those from SE. We compared the numbers of
reads, which were aligned by ReviSTER SE and BWA SE and
concordant with non—reference allele candidates detected by
ReviSTER PE and BWA PE for NA19153 to validate improve—
ment of alignments after ReviSTER’s revision of data from SE
approaches (Fig. 3). While 78 672 reads aligned by ReviSTER SE
supported non—reference allele candidates detected by both of
ReviSTER PE and BWA PE, only 71339 reads aligned by
BWA SE supported the same allele candidates. The numbers
of allele candidates commonly detected by different mapping
approaches are shown in the Supplementary Figure S11.

3.4 Two sequencing datasets from a single human
individual

We used two sequencing datasets from blood and saliva samples
from a single human individual. The reads were aligned to the
human genome reference NCBI build 37 by BWA and realigned
by GATK. Among 1 362903 STR loci (see ‘Test set’ in
Methods), 1349170 and 1347 548 loci were completely covered
by 38 150 693 reads from the blood sample and 39 927 488 reads
from the saliva samples, respectively. Most of the reads
(28 836 900 reads from blood and 30 238042 from saliva) sup—
ported reference alleles. To test the performance of ReviSTER,
we compared the consistencies of GATK genotyping results in

allele candidates and realign reads for such loci. This issue,
common to for other mapping and genotyping programs, may
be reduced as advanced sequencing technologies begin producing
longer reads than current technologies.

With the traditional resequencing approach, many researchers
consider mismapping of reads a difficult problem yet to be
resolved, while a few methods have been developed to revise
partially misaligned reads. ReviSTER is the first program to
revise not only partially misaligned reads but also mismapped
reads to STR loci. Like other programs, its performance can be
improved in the future. First, its performance is greatly affected
by the initial mapping results from BWA and BLAT. In our
comparison, we observed that Bowtie2 showed better perforrn—
ance than BWA. ReviSTER currently uses BWA for the initial
mapping (because of the ‘XA’ tags. The information in the tags
are used only to revise PE), but an additional module to use
other mapping programs with better performance will be imple—
mented in near future. Second, in the local mapping reference
reconstruction step, the current version of ReviSTER searches
for only exact match of two reads to connect them in a graph to
reduce the possibility of creating a graph supporting false—posi—
tive alleles. This may result in not creating any graph with reads
containing sequencing errors. Time efﬁciency is also a limitation
of the current version (Supplementary Table S5). It has been
implemented in PERL, so we would expect signiﬁcant speedup
in the next version to be implemented in C or C++.

The significant advantage of ReviSTER is fault tolerant auto—
mation, which is one of the most important functions for
complex pipelines. ReviSTER has been designed to be fully auto—
mated and to easily recover an analysis after a process interrup—
tion by a system failure such as a power failure. When the
analysis process is restarted, ReviSTER begins the process
from the unﬁnished step if users type the same command as
the original run.

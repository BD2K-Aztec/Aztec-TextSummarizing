through conditions built into the algorithm (i.e. making sure that
the primer sequences are first, conserved in, and second, unique
to the speciﬁc pathogen species or group). With this method,
based on the identiﬁed UCR l8—mers, detection primers were
selected for 14 of the 15 groups (Table 3). These primers also
met additional requirements that facilitate ampliﬁcation and de—
tection (e.g. having 0.6~1 kb product size, 46~54% GC%,

3/ GC clamps, <3OC melting temperature differences between
forward and reverse primer pairs and <10kcal/mole heterodi—
mer/homodimer AGs). There are many primer sets satisfying
these requirements from within the UCRs for each genome,
and one random set for each genome was chosen. The identiﬁed
UCR k—mers for the Pﬂuorescens were too few in number and
too far apart to produce any usable primers.

“Location information is relative to the reference genome.

To test the performance of the designed primers, eight sets of
primers were used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifi-
cations of DNA extracted from both single strain cultures and
materials containing mixed bacterial cultures (Fig. 3). The se-
lected PCR primers are between 22 and 29 bp long, with an aver-
age length of 24 bp. The PCR product size is between 576 and

tures were ordered from ATCC, and dairy products containing
live probiotic cultures were used to represent mixed bacterial cul-
ture samples (Supplemental Material). The PCR products were
analyzed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Supplementary Material), and
reactions that had clean band at the expected size were recorded
as successful detections. These eight primer sets were able to
speciﬁcally target the intended strain, even from samples contain-
ing multiple bacterial species and non-bacterial organisms.

4 DISCUSSION

The UCR identiﬁcation method described here was able to suc-
cessfully and automatically, with reasonable efficiency, identify
regions that are both conserved in and unique to a selected bac-
terial group (a species or strain) solely based on their genomic
sequences. These regions are by definition ideal diagnostic targets
for nucleic acid hybridization, amplification and/or sequencing.
Although high-throughput sequencing has been used in major
medical centers to identify and track emerging epidemics and
multidrug-resistant bacterial infections (Snitkin el 61]., 2012),
most medical facilities and reference laboratories lack the neces-
sary equipment or personnel to take full advantage of these latest
technologies. However, with this method, effective and accurate
nucleic acid diagnostic targets could be rapidly identified from
the data generated at those major medical centers or government
agencies, and can be quickly adopted by most hospitals and
laboratories with existing procedures such as PCR.

A method for de novo nucleic acid diagnostic target discovery

 

The UCRs identiﬁed for the 15 bacterial species are now freely
available at http://ucr.synblex.com. The source code of the pro—
grams used in this study is accessible at http://ucr.synblex.com/
bacterialIdSourceCode.d.zip, while an automated pipeline for
diagnostic target and primer selection is under development.
Hopefully, this new method could rapidly and efficiently gener—
ate diagnostic targets that are both speciﬁc and sensitive,
and ultimately lead to improved bacterial infectious disease
management.

4.1 Intended usage and known limitations

A group must be clearly identiﬁed before the application of this
method. Therefore, this method provides a possibility for large
clinical testing centers, pharmaceutical companies and research
laboratories to identify more efficient diagnostic markers, PCR
primers and other products in managing bacterial infec—
tions caused by a known group of bacteria. Additionally, this
method might also provide insights for the discovery of the mar—
kers of an unknown bacterial infectious agent present in patients
with shared symptoms but without a clinically known disease,
for example, by identifying UCRs in assembled patient micro—
biome data.

One signiﬁcant drawback of this method is that it requires at
least a few available genomes within a group to select UCRs and
UCR primers. If only one or two genomes are available to rep—
resent a group, the properties of the generated UCRs and UCR
primers are usually violated. However, the number of available
genomes has increased signiﬁcantly and is continuing to rise,
which might be able to alleviate the impact of this drawback.

Additionally, as with any laboratory testing procedures, a test
result only provides one piece of information on which the
health—care providers make a diagnosis. Furthermore, it is
known that pathogenic strains might be present asymptomati—
cally within some individuals (e.g. silent carriers), while some
environmental bacteria might cause severe infections in individ—
uals with a compromised immune system. As a result, it is worth
reiterating that the presence of a pathogenic strain might not
immediately equate clinical symptoms, although such a discovery
could provide valuable information about infectious disease dis—
persion and transmission. In contrast, the absence of all known
pathogens, opportunistic or otherwise, is not evidence of an
absence of bacterial infection. Therefore, in the latter cases,
where infection symptoms are obvious, appropriate antibiotic
treatment should be provided at the health—care providers’ dis—
cretion, especially to individuals with known immunodeﬁciency.

4.2 Applicability on partially assembled genomes and
limitations with raw sequencing reads

This method could be used on partially assembled genomes.
However, due to its principle and how the raw sequencing
reads were currently generated, this method should not be used
on raw sequence data when building the background k—mer
index. Currently, on most NGS—sequencing platforms (e.g.
Illumina, Ion Torrent, 454, etc.), the error rate for each single
raw read is relatively high. Only through combining multiple raw
reads together at the same location through mapping or de novo
assembly could a reasonably reliable sequence be achieved.
Although error—containing k—mers are unlikely to become

conserved within a group, this only ensures that one of the
UCR conditions (i.e. conserved in a speciﬁc group) is not vio—
lated. When the background k—mer index is built, and if raw
sequencing reads are allowed, these error—containing k—mers
will be calculated in the background k—mer index.
Subsequently, a random match between a true UCR k—mer for
one group and an error—containing k—mer from another group
would automatically rule out this true UCR k—mer in the selec—
tion process, as this by definition violates the other UCR condi—
tion (i.e. unique to a speciﬁc group). Currently, with billions of
reads generated for each experiment, a mere 3% error—containing
reads could still yield millions of error—containing k—mers, which
would create a substantial amount of noise in the background
k—mer index, and therefore, limit this method’s selection power
for k—mers unique to a given group. As a result, raw sequencing
reads should not be used in the process of building the back—
ground k—mer index. In contrast, if the background index has
already been built with completed genomes, and multiple sam—
ples of a new group were sequenced, UCR k—mers could be
identiﬁed directly from the raw sequencing reads with this
method. This will be a major functionality in the future release
of the fully automated pipeline.

Although partially assembled genomes contain gaps, the error
rate for each contig has been reduced to an acceptable level
through at least one round of assembly. The gaps (or break
points) between contigs will prevent the sequences spanning
these gaps from being indexed, and thus, the sequence informa—
tion close to the gaps would be lost. However, a routine micro—
bial genome sequencing project would typically generate no more
than 5(P100 large contigs, and these 5&100 gaps represent only
a limited amount of lost information, especially when the k—mer
length is several orders shorter than that of a contig.

4.3 UCRs as a concise reference database in microbiome
screening

In a typical microbiome screening, one key step in the analysis
pipeline is to identify the sources of the sequences within the
sample, usually by comparing these sequences against reference
databases. For example, for a metagenomic screening with 16S
amplicons, the raw reads could be compared against popular
databases such as Silva (Quast et al., 2012), RDP (Cole et al.,
2013) or Greengenes (McDonald et al., 2011). For a typical
WGS metagenomic screening, the raw reads could be directly
compared against all known genomes or the NCBI nr/nt data—
bases. This UCR method is capable of identifying regions that
can serve as markers for some of the known bacterial species, as
demonstrated in this study. If UCRs could be identiﬁed for most
clinically relevant species and/or strains, and with these UCRs as
a concise reference database, a routine clinical analysis would
only need to compare each raw metagenomic read with the rela—
tively few number of identiﬁed UCRs instead of the entire
known collection of genomes or the NCBI nr/nt databases. As
a result, in theory, the computational cost could be drastically
reduced.

However, as mentioned earlier, without considering contam—
ination and other human errors, the instrument error rate at the
raw sequencing read level is relatively high. A match between a
UCR and a raw sequencing read might be owing to such errors.

Therefore, as in any NGS analyses involving raw reads, only
after observing a significant amount of matched raw reads for
a given UCR, i.e. achieving a certain coverage threshold, could
one conﬁdently conclude the presence of the organism associated
with this UCR. Additionally, the fact that only a tiny percentage
of organisms have sequenced genomes dictates that UCRs can
only be calculated for a limited number of species or groups. As a
result, using UCRs as a reference database might be able to
drastically reduce computational time, but this is appropriate
when only known organisms (e.g. pathogens) are of interest in
a microbiome study, such as a routine clinical screening. In other
scientiﬁc studies, where the information from the previously un—
known species is of equal interest, the UCR reference database is
of limited usefulness.

4.4 Protein versus nucleic acid space k-mer indexing

Although a bacterial genome is mostly protein coding, and the
capacity of 8—mer peptide (2.6 x 1010 index length) is comparable
with that of the 18—mer DNA/ RNA sequence, due to codon de—
generacy, and therefore, the existence of synonymous mutations,
protein sequences are more conserved than DNA sequences be—
tween species. As a result, traditionally, intraspeciﬁc studies and
studies involving closely related species usually use nucleotide
sequences, as they have a higher observable substitution rate,
and hence, higher resolution for short evolutionary distances.
In contrast, studies involving long evolutionary processes (e.g.
over millions of years), usually use protein sequences, as their
relatively low substitution rate retains alignable sequence pat—
terns better and is less prone to the effect of multiple hits over
a long evolutionary process. With the purpose being identifying
diagnostic markers that are capable of differentiating between
species or strains, nucleic acid sequence markers are more appro—
priate. However, for other genomes with an extremely high mu—
tation rate (6. g. viral genomes), nucleic acid UCRs might not be
feasible because of the higher intraspeciﬁc/interstrain differences.
In this case, peptide UCRs would be more appropriate, as their
protein sequences are more conserved.

4.5 Possibilities and limitations beyond bacterial genomes

This method was demonstrated with bacterial genomes.
Theoretically, this method could also be applicable in eukary—
otes. However, the limited number of available genomes within
a eukaryotic species has severely restricted applicability. For
example, even with the 1000 Fungal Genome Project, there are
currently <200 publically available fungal genomes, and on aver—
age, there is only one complete genome for each fungal species.
Without a substantial number of genomes sampled for each spe—
cies or strain, there would not be any conservation information
for a given group, nor would there be a robust background
k—mer index. With an increasingly faster genome generation
rate, and more and more completed fungal genomes, it is
hoped that this limitation could soon be addressed.

Although close to 2000 viral genomes have been published, the
application on viruses is more challenging. Because of their high
mutation rate, and the resulting low sequence similarity between
genomes within the same viral species, we have failed to identify any
viral nucleic acid UCRs on a species level (with k> 15). Instead,
peptide UCRs might be possible and more appropriate. The same

algorithm could be adapted to index and screen for uniquely con—
served peptide sequences, but validating the results would be
signiﬁcantly more challenging, and viral processing and protein
sequencing are beyond the capability of this research group.

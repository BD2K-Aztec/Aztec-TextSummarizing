reads discordant to the genotype and nﬁ‘], n}; are the number of reads with
base A and B at locus m, respectively. Therefore, we include in the model
two parameters: the aggregate error rate (a) and overdispersion of the
allelic expression (<p). If the SNP data and RNA-seq come from two
different individuals or the RNA is contaminated, we expect a large a
and a small (p. The large overdispersion (small (p) in allelic expression for
discordant samples results from the fact that the RNA-seq reads can
come from a homozygous SNP. In such a situation, the SNP site will
show extremely high or low allelic expression, and the sequencing error
model alone cannot capture this part of information. The maximum like-
lihood estimate (MLE) of a is C/(C+D). However, no closed-form
solution exists for the MLE of (p. Numerical method, such as Newtoni
Raphson, can be used to estimate the MLE of (p. Finally, to scale the
overdispersion parameter between 0 and l, we redefine overdispersion
d: l/(l +<p), with large value indicating more evidence of discordance
of the two samples.

3 APPLICATION AND DISCUSSION

We have used IDCheck on a subset of 70 siblings from 35
families from our family—based studies (Liang et (11., 2013).
Each sample has >5 million (range from 5 to 120 M) paired—
end 101 bp reads generated by the Illumina GA II Sequencing
platform. SNPs were characterized with the Illumina
HumanHap300 BeadChip, which is now available through
EGA, accession number: EGAS00000000137. To evaluate the
error rate and overdispersion for different situations, we simulate
RNAiDNA mismatched samples by first swapping samples
within families (i.e. swapping the genotype sample labels between
siblings) and then between families (swapping the genotype
sample labels between families). We also simulated RNA—con—
taminated samples by randomly replacing 10 or 50% RNA—seq
reads from one sample with reads from another sample. The
error rate and overdispersion for correctly matched samples,
within—family and between—family swapped samples and RNA—
contaminated samples are shown in Figure 1 (Supplementary
Fig. S1).

The ranges of error rate for samples correctly matched sam—
ples, and those permuted within families and between families
are 000370.196, 0.176~0.46 and 0.34&0.582, and the overdisper—
sions are 0.04}0.166, 037741662 and 0.52}0.816, respectively.
These values will provide a good reference for other users to
determine potential swapping and contamination. In general,
for deeper RNA—seq data, we would expect higher precision
for error rate and overdispersion estimates, and, therefore, im—
proves discrimination. Our results suggest that 5 M reads will be
largely sufﬁcient for performing an IDCheck analysis. We found
that even with 2 M reads, the sample swapping can still be clearly
identiﬁed (Supplementary Fig. S2). In some cases, it might be
desirable to perform ID checking using low—coverage sequencing
before undertaking additional large—scale sequencing.

It is worth to note that the combination of error rate and
overdispersion parameters clearly outperform the discrimination
relying on only either parameters. The correctly matched samples
can be clearly separated from contaminated or swapped samples
by using a straight line in the 2D plot in Figure 1, whereas there
is no such cut—point in either dimension that can clearly distin—
guish the five groups of samples from each other.

IDCheck is designed for RNA—seq data identify checking. The
current approach explicitly models sequencing, genotyping error
and potential allele—speciﬁc expression. We note that this pack—
age can also be applied to DNA sequencing data identify check—
ing when both DNA sequencing and array—based genotype data
are available. In this application, mismatching of heterozygous
genotypes will be modeled as overdispersion or sequencing error.
IDCheck is efficient and can be applied to large—scale data. We
estimated that the time needed for each 30M reads is ~8 min
on a standard desktop computer when starting with a mapped
BAM file.

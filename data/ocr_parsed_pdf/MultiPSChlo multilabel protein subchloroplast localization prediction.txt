Abstract

Motivation: Identifying protein subchloroplast localization in chloroplast organelle is very helpful
for understanding the function of chloroplast proteins. There have existed a few computational pre—
diction methods for protein subchloroplast localization. However, these existing works have
ignored proteins with multiple subchloroplast locations when constructing prediction models, so
that they can predict only one of all subchloroplast locations ofthis kind of multilabel proteins.
Results: To address this problem, through utilizing label—specific features and label correlations
simultaneously, a novel multilabel classifier was developed for predicting protein subchloroplast
location(s) with both single and multiple location sites. As an initial study, the overall accuracy of
our proposed algorithm reaches 55.52%, which is quite high to be able to become a promising tool
for further studies.

Availability and implementation: An online web server for our proposed algorithm named MultiP—
SChlo was developed, which are freely accessible at http://biomed.zzuli.edu.cn/bioinfo/multip—

1 Introduction

Chloroplasts are organelles in most green plant cells, and also exists
in some eukaryotic organisms, such as seaweed. Chloroplast’s main
function is to conduct photosynthesis, where they capture and store
the energy from the sunlight, transform it to chemical energy, and
finally release oxygen from water. In addition to the important
photosynthesis, they are also responsible for carrying out a lot of
other functions, including fatty acid synthesis and the immune
response in plants. Chloroplast proteins play different roles in the
biological processes mentioned above. Knowing the functions of
these proteins is of significant value. Due to the very close relation-
ship between the functions and localizations of chloroplast proteins,

identifying the subchloroplast localizations of these proteins in
chloroplast organelle is very helpful for understanding the function
of chloroplast proteins.

With in-depth study of cell organelles, the researchers have
found a number of substructures in cell organelles, such as nuclear
chromatin, heterochromatin, nuclear envelope, nucleolus in the nu-
cleus, inner membrane, outer membrane in the mitochondria,
stronia, thylakoid in the chloroplast and so on. In order to more
deeply understand the function of these proteins, it is necessary to
identify the subchloroplast localizations of these proteins in the or-
ganelle level. As can be seen from the recently released UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot database (release 2013,05), there are a total of 14408

chloroplast proteins, where 7367 chloroplast proteins have sub—
chloroplast localization annotations, accounting for about 7367/
14408 : 51% of all chloroplast proteins. However, of the 7367
chloroplast proteins with subchloroplast localization annotations,
6955 are annotated with experimental confidence and 412 anno—
tated with uncertain terms such as ‘by similarity’, ‘probable’ and
‘potential’. Therefore, there are only 6955 chloroplast proteins with
determined subchloroplast localization annotations, which are
about 6955/14408 : 48% of all chloroplast proteins. In other
words, subchloroplast localizations of more than half of the chloro—
plast proteins need to be further identified either by computational
methods or biological experiments. Since the organelle is a more
microscopic structure unit relative to the cell, it is more difficult and
time—consuming to determine protein sub—subcellular localizations
by biological experiments. With explosively increasing of protein se—
quences in the post—genomic era, the gap between the sequence num—
ber and function annotations of chloroplast proteins will become
more and more wide. To fill the gap, it is very necessary to develop
new computational prediction methods for predicting protein sub—
chloroplast localizations.

In recent years, there have existed a few computational predic—
tion methods for protein sub—subcellular localizations, such as,
subnuclear localization prediction (Kumar et al., 2014; Shen and
Chou, 2005), submitochondria localization prediction (Du and Li,
2006; Lin et al., 2013a) and subchloroplast localization prediction
(Du et al., 2009; Saravanan and Lakshmi, 2013) concerned in this
article. In the field of subchloroplast localization prediction, the first
pioneering work is completed by Du et al. (2009). They constructed
the first public benchmark dataset in the field, and developed a new
predictor based on pseudoamino acid composition (PseAAC) and
the evidence—theoretic K—nearest neighbor (ET—KNN) classifier.
Since then, other researchers have also proposed a few prediction
methods for protein subchloroplast localization. However, these
existing works have the following drawbacks: (i) only considering
the small number of subchloroplast locations, reducing practicality
of prediction methods, (ii) the homologous bias of the benchmark
dataset adopted is too large to accurately evaluate the performance
of prediction methods, for instance, the dataset constructed by Du
et al. has as high as 60% protein sequence similarity, (iii) more
importantly, ignoring proteins with multiple subchloroplast loca—
tions when constructing prediction models, so that these existing
works will not be able to completely predict all the subchloroplast
locations of these multilabel proteins.

It has been observed that more and more proteins have multiple
subcellular or sub—subcellular locations. Actually, multilabel pro—
teins should not be ignored because they may have some special
biological functions worthy of our in—depth notices. Recently, some
multilabel predictors have been developed for predicting subcellular
localization of proteins with both single and multiple sites, such as,
iLoc—Plant (Wu et al., 2011), iLoc—Animal (Lin et al., 2013b), Plant—
mPLoc (Chou and Shen, 2010) and MLPred—Euk (Wang and Li,
2013). A review article (Chou, 2013) has concluded recent advances
in predicting multilabel attributes in molecular biosystems.

However, none of the existing multilabel predictors was specially
developed for chloroplast proteins. In this article, we aim to develop
a novel computational method that can predict single and multiple
subchloroplast locations for chloroplast proteins simultaneously by
overcoming the above three problems. Firstly, we constructed a new
benchmark dataset that contains chloroplast proteins with both
single and multiple subchloroplast locations. To enlarge the predic—
tion scope, the number of subchloroplast locations concerned is
increased from 4 to 5. To avoid redundancy and homology bias,

protein sequence similarity in the new—constructed dataset is con—
trolled under 40%. Secondly, through selecting features that are
most related to each subchloroplast location, respectively, and tak—
ing into account correlations between different subchloroplast loca—
tions simultaneously, we proposed a novel multilabel algorithm that
can accurately predict multilabel protein subchloroplast localiza—
tions. Finally, we developed an online web server for our proposed
algorithm called MultiP—SChlo freely accessible at http://biomed.
zzuli.edu.cn/bioinfo/multip—schlo/.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Dataset

In this article, the chloroplast protein sequences used here were col—
lected from the UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot database (release 2013_05).
To obtain a high quality benchmark dataset, we preprocessed the
raw data in the database according to the following steps:

1. Only those proteins with single or multiple subchloroplast local—
ization annotations were collected. In this article, the following
ﬁve subchloroplast locations, Envelope, Stroma, Thylakoid
lumen, Thylakoid membrane and Plastoglobule, were used to
search the UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot database (release 2013_05).
Among them, Plastoglobule is newly added in this study.

2. Ambiguous annotated proteins, such as ‘by similarity’, ‘prob—
able’ and ‘potential’ were excluded, because they might intro—
duce noisy data for decreasing prediction performance.

3. Those proteins annotated as ‘fragment’ or containing less than
50 amino acid residues were excluded.

4. Proteins containing ambiguous letters, like ‘B’, ‘X’ or ‘Z’, were
excluded.

5. To avoid redundancy and homology bias, protein sequence simi—
larity in the new—constructed dataset was controlled fewer than
40% using the CD—HIT program (Fu et al., 2012). Due to short—
age of available chloroplast protein sequences, we do not choose
a smaller sequence similarity cutoff value. When there are more
chloroplast proteins available in future, we will further lower
the cutoff value for obtaining more rigorous benchmark dataset.

Through the above process, we obtained the benchmark dataset
MSchlo5 78 including 578 chloroplast proteins distributed in the fol—
lowing 5 main subchloroplast locations, Envelope, Stroma,
Thylakoid lumen, Thylakoid membrane and Plastoglobule, of which
556 proteins are associated with one subchloroplast location, 21
with two subchloroplast locations, one with three subchloroplast lo—
cations, and none with four and more subchloroplast locations. The
number of chloroplast proteins belonging to each subchloroplast lo—
cation are presented in Table 1. The number of chloroplast proteins
with different number of subchloroplast locations can be found in
Figure 1. The benchmark dataset is provided in Supplementary Data
or can be downloaded from our online web server (http://biomed.
zzuli.edu.cn/bioinfo/multip—schlo/).

According to the PseAAC feature extraction method, the kth
protein pk in the training set Tr, can be denoted as

Pk : [drip-WIT (4)

where D is the dimensionality of PseAAC feature vector, and
D : 20 + 6 X 50 : 320 in this study. For classifiers in the first level,
they can be constructed simply by training SVM on the correspond—
ing training set. For the second level, the constructing method is
relatively more complicated for classifiers in the second level. We
first append all class labels except the current one to be predicted
into the original feature space as additional features, and thus the
augmented protein pk can be denoted as

. . T
pk : [17227inH7pgtyityi7”’7yIz—17yIz+17”’7y2/l] (5)

where the former D features are the PseAAC features of the kth
protein pk, and the latter M — 1 features represent whether the
kth protein pk belongs to the other subchloroplast locations ex—
cept the ith location or not, that is, if the protein pk belongs to
the / subchloroplast location (i : 1,2, - - - ,i — 1,i+ 1, - - - ,M),
then 3/), : 1, otherwise 3/), : —1. After that, we choose the most
relevant PseAAC features and class labels from the augmented
feature space for the ith subchloroplast location by using fea—
ture selection techniques. In this study, genetic algorithm is
used for feature selection. Then the kth protein pk can be re—
denoted as

. . . T
17k:[173.14%~7PZ’73’Z17yZ’w-wyiml 

where [21,22,---,2d] Q [1,2,---,D], [p1,p2,---,pm] Q [1,2,---,
i— 1,i+ 1, - - - ,M], the former d features are the optimal PseACC
feature subset selected, and the latter m features the optimal sub—
chloroplast location subset selected. Finally, classifiers in the second
level can be constructed by training SVM based on the optimal fea—
ture subset and location subset. Because we not only utilize the most
relevant features for each subchloroplast location, but also mix in
correlations among different subchloroplast locations at the same
time, our proposed algorithm ought to achieve better prediction
performance.

Representation of individuals and evaluation of the fitness
function are two important steps in applying the genetic algorithm
for feature subset selection. Firstly, each individual in the popula—
tion is represented by a n—dimensional binary vector f. In this
study, 11 : (320 + 4) X 5. Specifically, each n—dimensional binary
vector 7' is divided into five groups, where each group corresponds
to a different label (subchloroplast location in this study). Each
group also consists of two parts, where the first part represents
the PseAAC features (320D) and the other part represents all class
label features except the corresponding one (4D). The correspond—
ing feature 17, is excluded if f,: 0, and is included otherwise.
According to the feature selection information provided by each
individual f, the selected features and labels for each label (sub—
chloroplast location in this study) are retained. Secondly, the value
of the fitness function for each individual 7' is computed as the
overall accuracy [ACC as defined in Equation (10)] of the jack—
knife test.

Given a query protein 17*, its subchloroplast locations can be pre—
dicted according to the following steps:

1. Using PseACC model to extract the feature vector from the
query protein 17*, just like in Equation (4).

2. Inputting the protein 17* into the classiﬁers in the ﬁrst level, and
then M prediction outputs for 17* will be obtained

{3’173’27  7yM} E {+17_1} 

where 3/, represents whether 17* is predicted belonging to the jth
subchloroplast location or not.

3. Using Equation (5) to augment p*’s feature space. From
Equation (5), we know subchloroplast locations for p" are
needed to append to p*’s feature space as additional features.
But we don’t know which subchloroplast locations it belongs to.
Actually, those are exactly what we want to predict. Therefore,
we take the intermediate outputs generated in step 2 as its loca—
tion estimation, and then augment p*’s feature space by using its
location estimation. This is why we construct classiﬁers in the
ﬁrst level.

4. According to Equation (6), selecting out the optimal feature sub—
set of the query protein 17* for each subchloroplast location,
respectively.

5. These optimal feature subsets from step 4 are put into classiﬁers
in the second level accordingly, and then M ﬁnal prediction out—
puts for 17* will be obtained

  

According to Equation (8), the predicted subchloroplast locations to
which the query protein {7* belongs can be represented as

pred—Set(p*) :  :  Z 1727  7M} 

2.4 Performance measures

Predicting subchloroplast localizations for chloroplast proteins with
both single and multiple sites belongs to the case of multilabel classi—
fication. In machine learning community, it is well—known that per—
formance evaluation of multilabel classification differs from that of
traditional single—label classification because each example may
have more than one labels simultaneously. Therefore, the following
five novel measures are used to evaluate the performance of our pro—
posed method from multiple aspects more exactly. These evaluation
measures are defined as follows (Tsoumakas et al., 2010):

1 W (Y,- mz,(
mlACC:— —
 UZ,-)

1 m (Y,mz,~(
mlPRE:— —
 12:1

1 m (Y,mz,~(
mlREcz—E — (10)
mi:1 

2 - mlREC - mlPRE

mlF1 : mlREC + mlPRE

 

1 m _
ACC _ $2107,- = 2,.)

where Y, is the set of true labels of each example, Z, the set of pre—
dicted labels of each one, m the number of test examples, I - l the op—
erator acting on the set to count the number of its elements.
1(Y, E Z,) equals 1 if true labels are entirely identical to predicted
labels, 0 otherwise. mlF1 is the harmonic mean of multilabel recall
(mlREC) and multilabel precision (mlPRE). Note that for these
above measures, the bigger the measure value, the better the

performance. As mentioned above, it is much more complicated to
evaluate the performance of a classifier on a multilabel system. To
understand the measures more easily, the readers should refer to the
review article (Chou, 2013) where the meanings of these measures
have been explained more intuitively.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Evaluating our proposed algorithm on the
benchmark dataset MSchlo578

Since the jackknife test is thought to be the most objective and rigor—
ous method for cross validation, it has been increasingly used by in—
vestigators to examine the accuracy of various predictors (Guo
et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2013b; Liu et al., 2014; Wang and Li, 2012;
Wang et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2011). Accordingly, the jackknife test
was also adopted to examine the performance of the model pro—
posed in this study. We applied the most commonly used SVM soft—
ware libSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) and optimized the parameters
of each SVM classifier as defined in Equation (1) with a grid search
strategy. The multilabel prediction outcomes obtained by our pro—
posed prediction algorithm on the benchmark dataset MSchlo578
for the five performance measures as defined in Equation (10) are as
follows, 63.26% (mlACC), 64.10% (mlPRE), 71.06% (mlREC),
67.38% (mlF1) and 55.52% (ACC). From its definition as defined
in Equation (10), the overall accuracy (ACC) is the most strict one
of the five measures without any overprediction or underprediction.
So it is difficult to obtain very high overall accuracy (ACC). This in—
dicates our proposed prediction algorithm achieves sufficiently high
overall accuracy (ACC) and could become quite a promising multi—
label predictor. To demonstrate the power of our algorithm, we car—
ried out a fair comparison between our algorithm and the state—of—
the—art AL—KNN (also called ML—KNN) algorithm commonly used
in predicting multilabel protein subcellular localization (Chou et al.,
2011, 2012; Lin et al., 2013b). We use the same features and the
same jackknife test method to evaluate the performance of the AL—
KNN classifier on the same benchmark dataset MSchlo578. The
parameter K of the AL—KNN algorithm was optimized. The detailed
results of the prediction performance are presented in Table 2. As
can be seen from the table, our proposed algorithm significantly out—
performs the state—of—the—art AL—KNN algorithm in terms of the five
performance measures.

It is noteworthy that obtaining and comparing the accuracy of
each subchloroplast location is meaningless in a multilabel predic—
tion task just like the current study. Therefore, we give the overall
accuracies (ACCs) for proteins with different number of labels (sub—
chloroplast locations in this study) by our algorithm in Table 3, ra—
ther than the accuracy of each subchloroplast location. Moreover,
for comparison, the overall accuracies (ACCs) by the AL—KNN algo—
rithm are also shown in Table 3. As can be seen from the table, the
overall accuracies (ACCs) by our algorithm are significantly higher
than those by the AL—KNN algorithm. Particularly, for proteins
with two subchloroplast locations, our algorithm performs better
than the AL—KNN algorithm with a more than 42% big improve—
ment. This indicates our algorithm is more capable of dealing with
the multilabel prediction tasks than the state—of—the—art AL—KNN
algorithm.

To further evaluate the prediction performance of our algorithm,
we carried out an independent dataset test. In the independent data—
set test, 20% of samples were randomly selected as the testing data—
set. The remaining samples were used to train our algorithm and the
AL—KNN algorithm. The prediction performance would be tested

on the testing dataset. The procedure would be repeated 10 times to
see whether the performance would vary significantly for different
random selections. The averages and the standard deviations of the
performances in ten repeats would be reported for the five measures.
The performance details obtained by our algorithm and the AL—
KNN algorithm can be found in Table 4. Obviously, our algorithm
still performs significantly better than the AL—KNN algorithm.
Moreover, the standard deviations of the performances are small, ap—
proximate 4%, for both our algorithm and the AL—KNN algorithm.
This indicates both our algorithm and the AL—KNN algorithm are
not over—estimated.

3.2 Comparison with the existing single—label predictors
As mentioned in the Introduction section, all the existing methods
can only be used to identify the single subchloroplast location of a
query protein, none of the existing methods can be used to deal with
proteins with multiple subchloroplast locations. Nevertheless, it is
still interesting to see if our algorithm could work better than the
existing methods for the same single—label problem that the existing
methods have tackled. We compare our proposed algorithm with
several recent state—of—the—art predictors, SubChlo (Du et al., 2009),
ChloroRF (Tung et al., 2010), SubIdent (Shi et al., 2011) and BS—
KNN (Hu and Yan, 2012). All of them are the sequence—based pre—
dictors. SubChlo was based on the ET—KNN (evidence theoretic
K—nearest neighbor) algorithm and PseAAC, ChloroRF was based
on the Random Forest algorithm and the physicochemical properties
of protein amino acid sequences, SubIdent was based on the Support
Vector Machine and the discrete wavelet transform feature extrac—
tion method, and BS—KNN was based on the bit—score weighted
K—nearest neighbor (BS—KNN) algorithm and the selected PseAAC.
To obtain a comparable result with these predictors, we also evalu—
ate the prediction performance of our algorithm on the same dataset
S60 as used in these predictors by using the jackknife test method.
For the dataset S60, it contains 262 proteins classified into four dif—
ferent subchloroplast locations, in which 40 proteins belong to the
‘Envelope’ location site, 49 to the ‘Stroma’, 44 to the ‘Thylakoid
lumen’ and 129 to the ‘Thylakoid membrane’. The performances of

these compared methods are presented in Table 5. As we can see
from the table, the overall accuracy of our algorithm is over 88%,
which is significantly better than all the compared predictors except
SubIdent. Compared with SubIdent, our algorithm obtains a com—
parable overall accuracy (88.6% versus 89.3%). Particularly, the ac—
curacy of our algorithm is superior to SubIdent in the ‘Stroma’
location site, and inferior to SubIdent in the ‘Envelope’ location site,
and the similar results are obtained by our algorithm and SubIdent
in the other two location sites. This observation indicates that al—
though it is specially designed for predicting multilabel protein sub—
chloroplast locations, our algorithm also performs well in predicting
single—label protein subchloroplast locations.

4 Web server

Based on the above prediction algorithm, we developed an online
web server for providing multilabel protein subchloroplast localiza—
tion prediction service, called MultiP—SChlo freely accessible at
http://biomed.zzuli.edu.cn/bioinfo/multip—schlol, by which biologists
can easily obtain their desired results with no need for professional
math and computer knowledge.

5 Conclusion

In this article, we further study sub—structures of the chloroplast
organelle, and try to identify subchloroplast locations of proteins
with both single and multiple sites. All the existing predictors have
the following drawbacks: (i) only considering the small number of
subchloroplast locations, (ii) homologous bias of the benchmark
dataset adopted is too large, (iii) more importantly, ignoring
proteins with multiple subchloroplast locations when constructing

prediction models. In view of this, we propose a novel multilabel
prediction algorithm for identifying multilabel protein
subchloroplast locations. The main contributions of this article is
as follows:

1. A new benchmark dataset is constructed that contains chloro—
plast proteins with both single and multiple subchloroplast loca—
tions. It not only covers much more subchloroplast locations but
also has much less homology bias.

2. A novel multilabel algorithm is proposed through combining
label—speciﬁc features with label correlations, which can predict
multilabel protein subchloroplast locations accurately.

3. An online web server for our proposed algorithm is established
called MultiP—SChlo freely accessible at http://biomed.zzuli.edu.

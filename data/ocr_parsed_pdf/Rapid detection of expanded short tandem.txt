making the identification and location of long STRs in a per—
sonal genome non—trivial.

Another serious problem is that STRs have several variants
with many mutations. The spontaneous mutation rate of STRs,
3.78 x 10—4 to 7.44 x 10—2 in the human Y—chromosome
(Ballantyne et al., 2010), is far higher than the rate of copy
number variation, 1.7 x 10—6 to 1.2 x 10—4 (Lupski, 2007), and
the reported average rate of de novo single—nucleotide variation,
1.18 ><10_8 (SD:0.15 ><10_8) (Conrad et al., 2011) and
1.20 x 10—8 (Kong et al., 2012). The ultrahigh mutation rate of
STRs is thought to be a major force driving genetic variation
producing a variety of STRs with differences often speciﬁc to
personal genomes. Therefore, detecting various STRs by process—
ing billions of short raw reads is fundamental to the analysis of
personal genomes.

Several software programs list STRs, such as Tandem Repeat
Finder (Benson, 1999), Mreps (Kolpakov et al., 2003),
ATRHunter (Wexler et al., 2005), IMEx (Mudunuri and
Nagarajaram, 2007) and T-reks (Jorda and Kajava, 2009) (for
a recent review that compares these programs, see Lim et al.,
2013); however, these conventional programs are designed to
retrieve STRs from nearly complete or draft long genomes and
are not intended for processing billions of short reads in a rea—
sonable amount of time. Another problem involved in handling
short reads is the difﬁculty of determining the accurate positions
of STRs in the genome because reads ﬁlled with STRs are not
included in the genome or often map to multiple locations. The
problem is solvable in some cases when a ﬂanking region around
an STR in a read is long enough to map to a unique position
(Fig. 1B). To resolve these special cases, Gymrek et a]. developed
the program lobSTR (Gymrek et al., 2012), which improves the
efﬁciency of this process by selecting ~240 000 candidate regions
harboring STRs in the human genome. Owing to severe restric—
tions in potential STR regions, however, we might overlook
novel STRs hidden in numerous short reads because known
STRs associated with diseases are frequently much longer than
100 bp, the typical length of short reads produced by high—
throughput sequencers (Fig. 1C).

Here, we propose a new cost—efﬁcient method for calculating a
comprehensive collection of STRs that are longer than short
reads by inspecting the frequency distribution of STRs in short
reads. To approximate the locations of such STRs, we use
paired—end sequencing to facilitate locating the opposite end of
the read with the focal STR in a pair, thereby narrowing down
the location of the focal STR. Finally, we present a statistical
procedure for selecting STRs that are signiﬁcantly expanded in
the case sample.

2 METHODS

2.1 Non-redundant representation of STRs

Our goal was to enumerate all possible instances of STRs with 276-base-
long repeat units efﬁciently. In general, our algorithm can detect repeat
units of an arbitrary length without sacriﬁcing computational time. We
also present an example of disease-associated STRs with a lO-base repeat
unit in SCA31 (Sato et al., 2009). Care is required to avoid double count-
ing identical STR occurrences characterized by more than one STR pat-
tern. To remove redundancy, the basic unit of an STR should be
minimized; e.g. the repeat unit of ACACACAC is AC rather than

ACAC. Another reduction method is to merge occurrences of the reverse
complement of an STR into the set of the focal STR. Therefore, we call
the repeat unit representative if it is not a repeat of a shorter unit and is
the ﬁrst lexicographical motif when all possible shifts of the motif and its
reverse complement are considered. Supplementary Table S1 presents the
numbers of representative repeat units with typical examples.

2.2 Efﬁcient algorithm for listing approximate STR5 in
billions of short reads

STRs are inherently ‘approximate’ in the sense that some unit occurrences
are allowed to contain a small number of mutations (Ballantyne et al.,
2010). Listing approximate STRs, however, becomes computationally
intractable because its time complexity grows exponentially in the max-
imum number of allowed mutations (Domanic and Preparata, 2007;
Pellegrini et al., 2010). Therefore, we use a heuristic approach to this
problem. We ﬁrst identify ‘exact’ STRs with no mutations in each
short read using an efﬁcient O(n log n)-time algorithm (Main, 1989),
where n is the length of the read. A repetition is any non-empty string
of the form (p)mq, where p, a non-empty string, is called the unit of the
repetition, m z 2, and q is a preﬁx of 17. For example,

(CAG)3CA = CAGCAGCAGCA

is a repetition of the form (p)mq, wherepoAG, m = 3 and q=CA, a
prefix of p. A repetition is maximal if it is not a proper substring
of a repetition that has the same unit. For example, consider the
following:

(CAG)2CA(CAG)2CA = CAGCAGCACAGCAGCA

(CAG)2CA, a repetition with unit CAG, is maximal. In addition, the
entire string is also a maximal repetition with unit (CAG)2CA. Listing all
maximal repetitions is sufﬁcient to identify all occurrences of STRs. We
performed the following steps to retrieve STRs from each read.

(1) Enumerate all maximal repetitions in a read using Main’s O(n log
n)-time algorithm, where n is the length of the read (Main, 1989).
More precisely, in 1984, Main and Lorentz designed an algorithm
for enumerating all repetitions of the form XX (Main and Lorentz,
1984). In 1989, Main modiﬁed the algorithm to calculate maximal
repetitions accurately (Main, 1989), and this is the version that we
used to implement our system.

(2) For each maximal repetition Y, identify the minimum unit U such
that U is not a repetition and Y is a concatenation of multiple
occurrences of U and a preﬁx of U. For example, when
Y: (CAG) 6CA, U: CAG.

(3) An approximate repetition is a substring such that its alignment
with repetition (U),,, is decomposed into series of exact matches of
length |U| or more, and neighboring series must have only one
mismatch, one insertion or one deletion between them in the align-
ment, where |U| indicates the length of U. We calculate an approxi-
mate repetition by extending a maximal (exact) repetition in both
directions in a greedy manner. For example, given

CGCCCGCAGCGCAT(CAG)6CATCAGGGA,
we can extend repetition (CAG)6CA to the underlined substring,
CGCCCGCAGC—GCAT(CAG)6CATCAGGGA,
where bold letters represent mismatches and ‘-’ indicates a deletion.
In this way, we retrieve an approximate STR that is not necessarily
an exact repeat of the minimum unit U but may contain mis-
matches and indels.

(4) A read may contain multiple overlapping STRs with the same unit.

If two overlap, eliminate the shorter one. If both are of the same
length, select one arbitrarily.

occurrences of individual STRs were present simultaneously in both. We
identiﬁed 60 STRs with lOObp occurrences in one (n: 13, 21.7%) or
both (n :47, 78.3%) replicates of NA12878 (Supplementary Table S3).
Of the 13 STRs with no counts in one replicate, 12 had one or two
occurrences in the other replicate and the remaining one had four in
the other. If an STR occurrence in the genome is short (e.g. 100 bp in
length), failure to observe the STR has a high probability (e.g. 50% for
50-fold coverage of reads assuming the random collection of reads).
Therefore, our method outputs essentially consistent results for the two
biological replicates.

This analysis also indicated that the failure to detect 100-bp occur-
rences of an STR did not imply the absence of a 100-bp expansion of
the STR in the focal personal genome. To be certain of its absence, we
examined if the frequency distribution of lengths of STR occurrences was
informative. Supplementary Figure S2 presents the frequency distribu-
tions of the 13 STRs in the two biological replicates. In most of the 13
STRs, when one biological replicate had 100-bp occurrences of an STR,
the other replicate had occurrences of length >90 bp, although for two
STRs, the longest occurrences were ~60 bp, which might stem from fac-
tors such as ampliﬁcation bias and variation in sequencing coverage.
Therefore, the absence of >60-bp STR occurrences does not necessarily
deny the existence of 100 bp expansions of the STR in the genome.

2.5 Locating long expansions of STR5 in the human
genome

The genomic positions of each uncovered STR in a read remain to be
determined. The problem is solvable if one of the two regions flanking an
STR maps to a unique position (Fig. 1B), the method used in lobSTR
(Gymrek et al., 2012). Otherwise, we attempt to use information on
paired-end reads, the two ends of an identical DNA fragment such that
their typical average length ranges from 300 to 350 bp with an average
standard deviation of ~10%. When one end-read is ﬁlled with an STR,
we test whether the other end maps to a unique position in the genome
using the BurrowsiWheeler Alignment Maximal Exact Matches algo-
rithm (BWA-MEM), a tool for aligning reads with the genome
(Li, 2013). If the test is successful, we can approximate the position of
the STR from the location of the other end (Fig. 1E). An STR can be
located if its location can be sandwiched using information on paired-end
reads (Fig. 1F and G). An STR shorter than 100 bp is easier to determine
(Fig. 1F), whereas estimating the lengths of longer STRs becomes more
difﬁcult (Fig. 1G). We will discuss this issue later in the text.

2.6 TRhist: a tool for sensing and locating STRs from
billions of short reads

To assist in the correct positioning of STRs, for a read with an STR
instance, our program outputs the repeat unit, length of the STR,
number of mutations in the STR, ﬂanking regions surrounding the
STR and other paired-end read. With this information, the user can
align the ﬂanking regions and other end read to the reference to locate
the STR in the genome. Our TRhist program is available at http://trhist.
gi.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/.

2.7 SMRTTM sequencing of expanded STRs

Successful identiﬁcation of an accurate position for one end provides
usede input for other analytical methods, such as repeat-primed polymer-
ase chain reaction (PCR) (Warner et al., 1996) and SMRTTM sequencing
(Eid et al., 2009; Loomis et al., 2013), to estimate or determine long
expansions of STRs. In particular, SMRTTM sequencing is capable of
reading DNA fragments of average length ~5 kb as of 2013 (Fig. 1G).
Using this emerging technology, Loomis et a]. reported the ﬁrst sequence,
750 CGG repeats, for fragile X syndrome (Loomis et al., 2013). Using
SMRTTM sequencing, we ampliﬁed the repeat region associated with

SCA31 using PCR primers 1.5k-ins-F (5’- ACTCCAACTGGGAT
GCAGTTTCTCAAT-3’) and 1.5k-ins-R (5’- TGGAGGAAGGAAAT
CAGGTCCCTAAAG-3’).

We will describe the analysis in the Section 3. PCR was performed in a
ﬁnal volume of 50 ul containing 0.2 MM of each primer, 200 MM of each
dNTP, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.25 U of PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase
(Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) and 100 ng of genomic DNA. The PCR proﬁle
comprised an initial denaturing at 95°C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles at
95°C for 20 s and 68°C for 8 min. The PCR product was puriﬁed on 0.8%
agarose gels and converted to the proprietary SMRTbellTM library
format using an RS DNA Template Preparation Kit 2.0 (Paciﬁc
Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA). Brieﬂy, the PCR product was end-
repaired, and hairpin adapters were ligated using T4 DNA ligase.
Incompletely formed SMRTbellTM templates were degraded with a com-
bination of exonuclease III and VII. The resulting DNA templates were
puriﬁed using SPRI magnetic beads (AMPure; Agencourt Bioscience,
Beverly, MA). Annealing was performed at a ﬁnal template concentra-
tion of 5nM, with a 20-fold molar excess of sequencing primer. The
annealing reaction was carried out for 2min at 80°C with slow cooling
to 25°C. Annealed templates were stored at —20°C until polymerase
binding. The DNA polymerase enzymes stably were bound to the
primed sites of the annealed SMRTbellTM templates using the DNA
Polymerase Binding Kit 2.0 (Paciﬁc Biosciences). SMRTbellTM template
(3 nM) was incubated with polymerase in the presence of phospholinked
(Paciﬁc Biosciences) nucleotides for 4h at 30°C. Following incubation,
the samples were stored at 4°C. Sequencing was performed within 36 h of
binding. Samples were sequenced using commercial sequencing chemis-
try. Sequencing data were collected on a PacBio RS (Paciﬁc Biosciences)
for 90 min. Given PacBio RS—ﬁltered subreads, we used the SMRT Pipe,
P_ErrorCorrection module to generate corrected reads. Subsequently, we
assembled these corrected reads using RS_CeleraAssembler to obtain
contigs.

3 RESULTS

Here, we demonstrate the utility of an ab initio procedure for
sensing, locating and sequencing STRs that are signiﬁcantly ex—
panded in the case sample.

Locating candidate STR positions

Select positions where STR occurrences are expanded signiﬁ—
cantly in the case sample in the following manner:

(1) Locate occurrences of each candidate STR in both the case
and control samples by anchoring paired—end reads such
that one end has a 350—bp occurrence of the STR and the
other end maps to a unique position.

(2) Group paired—end reads anchored in a neighborhood
(within ~300 bp, the average insert size of paired—end
reads) into one cluster (Fig. 2).

(3) In each cluster, generate the frequency distribution of STR
occurrences according to their lengths ranging from 50 to
100 bp (Fig. 2). If an STR in the cluster is signiﬁcantly
longer than 100 bp, the frequency of 100—bp occurrences
in reads, denoted by flog, becomes signiﬁcantly greater
than the frequencies of those shorter than 100 bp
(Fig. 2B). We test this hypothesis statistically by checking
if f10() is an outlier in the frequency distribution with the
SmirnoviGrubbs’ test. We calculate the t—score,
(flog — 10/0, where [L and a are the mean and standard
deviation of the frequency distribution, respectively, and
obtain the probability (P—value) that the t—score exceeds a

in germline and somatic cells of a speciﬁc disease might eventu—
ally lead to the recognition of a functional role of STRs.

In the near future, the typical lengths of short reads in the
majority of commercial sequencers should increase to 15(L500
bases. Our method is ready to process longer reads in a straight—
forward manner. Furthermore, our method was designed so that
it could output STRs of repeat units of any length, and we pre—
sented an illustrative case in which detecting STRs of a 10—base
repeat unit from an SCA31 sample was essential. Our program
will serve as a valuable tool for discovering unknown STRs in a
variety of diseases, even with future advances in sequencing
technology.

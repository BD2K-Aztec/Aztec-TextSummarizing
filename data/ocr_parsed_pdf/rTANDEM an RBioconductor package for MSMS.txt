ABSTRACT

Summary: rTANDEM is an R/Bioconductor package that interfaces
the XlTandem protein identification algorithm. The package can run
the multi-threaded algorithm on proteomic data files directly from R. It
also provides functions to convert search parameters and results to/
from R as well as functions to manipulate parameters and automate
searches. An associated R package, shinyTANDEM, provides a web-
based graphical interface to visualize and interpret the results.
Together, those two packages form an entry point for a general MS/
MS-based proteomic pipeline in R/Bioconductor.

Availability and implementation: rTANDEM and shinyTANDEM
are distributed in R/Bioconductor, http://bioconductor.org/packages/
release/bioc/. The packages are under open licenses (GPL—3 and
Artistice-1.0).

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein identiﬁcation and analysis by tandem mass spectrometry
relies mostly on matching spectra to a database of protein
sequences and scoring those matches. The resources of the R
statistical language and its platform Bioconductor (Gentleman
et al., 2004) have proven to be well suited for this kind of data
manipulation and statistical scoring with regard to genomic data.
However, those resources remain largely untapped with regard to
proteomic data. This is partly explained by the lack of tools to
perform protein identiﬁcation directly from R. rTANDEM ﬁlls
this gap by implementing in R the tandem algorithm (Craig and
BeaVis, 2004) and various associated scoring functions (Keller
et al., 2005; Kertesz—Farkas et al., 2014; MacLean et al., 2006).
rTANDEM also provides functions for conversion to/from R.
This brings to proteomics the many advantages of building an
analysis pipeline in the R/Bioconductor statistical platform: easy
deployment on high-performance computing and cloud comput-
ing through Bioconductor Cloud Amazon Machine Image
(AMI), fully open-source workﬁows, interconnectivity of anno-
tation and analytic packages, full reproducibility of analysis, etc.

2 rTANDEM

rTANDEM can use the same input as the classic XlTandem,
namely parameter files in XML format, FASTA databases and
spectra ﬁles in ASCII format (like DTA, PKL or mgf), and
return an XML result ﬁle. However, rTANDEM aims to stream-
line launching analyses, so it proposes different functions to
create and manipulate parameters within R. For example, func-
tions are provided for setting default values for different types of
mass spectrometers or scoring keys. It also proposes a more
complex syntax that allows multiple analyses to be launched
using a single parameter object. rTANDEM lends itself naturally
to the use of scripts for launching analyses, making every search
fully traceable and reproducible.

The data structure holding the results is an R S4 class
(Chambers, 1998, 2008) named rTResult. It contains slots to
retrieve the settings of the analysis (for example, the parameters
and data files used) and provide general statistics on the analysis
(like the total number of spectra assigned or the estimated false
discovery). The most important slots of the rTResult object are
four tables containing the information on protein, peptide and
Post Translational Modiﬁcation (PTM) identiﬁcations as well as
raw spectra. Those tables are of the class ‘data.table’, which is an
R class optimized for quick and memory-efﬁcient manipulation
of large datasets. The tables can be efficiently queried to make
subsets according to various properties (like identiﬁcation scores,
protein sequences or protein names) or can be subjected to vec-
torized operations.

One of the main advantages of using rTANDEM is that the
results are available as an R object, making it easy to create
complex processing pipelines that take full advantage of the

Fig. 2. Part of shinyTANDEM ‘Statistics’ tab. Two distributions are
ﬁtted to the total distribution of matches by score. Because the total
distribution is the sum of the correct and incorrect matches, this helps
to visualize appropriate conﬁdence thresholds for the experiment

resources of R and Bioconductor (Fig. 1). For example, protein
accession can be retrieved and passed to biomaRt (Durinck et al.,
2005, 2009) to retrieve cross-references or annotation, which in
turn can be passed to packages like topGO (Alexa and
Rahnenfuhrer, 2010) to calculate annotation enrichment and
RamiGO (Schroder, 2013) to display the Gene Ontology (GO)
tree. The online Supplementary Material provides a short tutor-
ial that demonstrates this kind of workﬁow.

3 shinyTANDEM

The shinyTANDEM package is a web-based graphical interface
that provides an easy way to Visualize results from rTANDEM.
It is based on the newly released ‘shiny’ package from the
RStudio team. This package adds web-server functionalities to
R, making it possible to Visualize the results of computations in a
web browser. shinyTANDEM extends the basic use of ‘shiny’ to
provide a full Graphical User Interface (GUI) from a single R
command. The interface will display in the user’s default web
browser.

The interface comprises a series of tabs representing various
aspects of the search results: overview, statistics, protein View,
peptide View. The ‘Overview’ tab presents the search parameters
as well as raw lists of protein and peptide identiﬁcations. The
‘Statistics’ tab plots the protein and peptide matches according to
their score and expectation values (Fig. 2). The ‘Protein’ tab
features ﬁlters to select speciﬁc proteins and present their cover-
age and associated peptides. The ‘Peptide’ tab presents filters to
select speciﬁc peptide sequences and see their associated MS2
spectra and protein sequence.

shinyTANDEM also features tabs that act as entry points
for R. A loading tab allows the user to change the R object
that is represented. Tabs allowing the user to create parameters
objects, launch analysis, start conversion process or link to other
R packages directly from the interface are currently being
implemented.

4 RESULTS

rTANDEM was tested on a recently published dataset of breast
cancer tissues (Liu et al., 2013) and compared with the reported
results obtained with MaxQuant (V.1.1.1.36). We used raw
data obtained from four whole tissue lysate of breast cancer
samples. rTANDEM obtained an average of 8044 unique pepti-
de-spectrum matches at an expect value <0.01 for those samples
(Supplementary Table S1). This represents a noticeable increase
compared with the original results from MaxQuant, which
reported an average of 6254 peptides per sample at P<0.01.

5 CONCLUSION

The Bioconductor package rTANDEM and its associated graph-
ical interface, shinyTANDEM, form an entry point to build
complete proteomics workﬂows in the R statistical language.
They provide ways to perform protein identiﬁcation directly
from R and to convert search results to/from R object. The S4
result data structure makes it easy to use R/Bioconductor to
build complex processing pipelines around proteomic datasets.
Further statistical tests for quantiﬁcation in rTANDEM are cur-
rently under development.

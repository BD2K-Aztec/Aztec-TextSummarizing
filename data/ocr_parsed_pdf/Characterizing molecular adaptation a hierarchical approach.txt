ABSTRACT

Motivation: A number of methods for detecting positive selection
in protein coding DNA sequences are based on whether each
site/region has a non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates
ratio a) greater than one. However, a site/region may show a
relatively large number of non-synonymous mutations that conserve
a particular property. Recent methods have proposed to consider
as evidence for molecular adaptations how conserving, or radically
different, non-synonymous mutations are with respect to some key
amino acid properties. While such methods have been useful in
providing a qualitative assessment of molecular adaptation, they rely
on independent statistical analyses for each amino acid property
and typically do not properly adjust for multiple comparisons when
selection needs to be assessed at several sites.

Results: We consider a Bayesian hierarchical model that allows
us to jointly determine if a set of amino acid properties are being
conserved or radically changed while simultaneously adjusting for
multiple comparisons at the codon level. We illustrate how this
model can be used to characterize molecular adaptation in two
datasets: an alignment from six class I alleles of the human major
histocompatibility complex and a sperm lysin alignment from 25
abalone species. We compare the results obtained with the proposed
hierarchical models to those obtained with alternative methods. Our
analyses indicate that a more complete quantitative and qualitative
characterization of molecular adaptation is achieved by taking into
account changes in amino acid properties.

1 INTRODUCTION

There are a variety of tests for detecting departures from neutrality.
Such tests could be Classiﬁed into two groups: those based
on the distribution of allele frequencies and/0r segregating sites
(e.g. Tajima’s test, Tajima, 1989), and those that explicitly study
patterns of polymorphisms/divergence in genes encoding proteins.
In this second category, most methods compare non-synonymous

with synonymous substitution rates at some level. Such methods
usually estimate non-synonymous t0 synonymous rates ratios to
study intra-speciﬁc variation (e.g. Li, 1993; Pamilo and Bianchi,
1993), provide a formal comparison between intra- and inter-speciﬁc
genetic variation (e.g. McDonald and Kreitman, 1991; Sawyer and
Hartl, 1992) or investigate Character evolution in a phylogeny by
using codon-based models (e.g. Suzuki and Gojobori, 1999; Suzuki,
2004; Yang and Nielsen, 2002; Yang and Swanson, 2002; Yang et al.,
2000a). In all cases, an excess of non-synonymous over synonymous
mutations is considered as indicative that some form of positive
selection may be taking place if a set of assumptions is met (see e.g.
Anisimova and Kosiol, 2009; Nei and Kumar, 2000).

Several investigators have tried to enrich the approaches listed
above by considering methods that take into account Changes in the
physicochemical properties of the amino acids; the rationale behind
this is that a replacement between two amino acids with similar
physicochemical Characteristics may not Change the phenotype in
the same way that a replacement between two amino acids that
are radically different does (Hughes et al., 1990; Zhang, 2000).
While the value of comparing radical versus non-radical Changes
as a formal test for positive selection is still under discussion
(Dagan et (11., 2002; Hanada et al., 2007; Sainudiin et al., 2005),
having a ﬂexible framework that allows us to explore Changes in
amino acid properties can provide useful insight in comparative
studies that aim to assess the effect of positive selection (Hanada
et (11., 2007; Popadin et (11., 2007). Among the methods that take
into account amino acid properties are those in Xia and Li (1998)
and McClellan et a1. (2005) that use calculations of expected
random distributions of possible amino acid Changes based on ﬁxed
differences between residues given a particular property. A related
approach is that of Pupko et al. (2003), which tests signiﬁcant
deviations of the mean physicochemical distance from the random
expectation along a lineage or across a subtree. The idea is to detect
signiﬁcant deviations from a process consistent with neutrality. For
instance, a trend toward radical Changes in a particular property is,
in principle, inconsistent with neutrality. More recent methods also
include those in Sainudiin et al. (2005) and Wong et al. (2006) which
consider codon substitution models that incorporate Changes in
physicochemical properties. These methods proceed by partitioning
the codons 0n the basis of a speciﬁc property, and then categorize
substitutions as property conserving or property altering depending
on whether there is a Change in the partition.

The methods listed above have been very useful in providing
a qualitative assessment of Changes in amino acid properties
that may be indicative of selection acting on the divergence

Assessing the selective influence of amino acid properties

 

of a protein-coding gene. However, such methods perform infer-
ences independently for each amino acid property or a prespeciﬁed
(property-driven) partition of the amino acids. In addition, some
of these methods do not properly adjust for multiple comparisons
when tests are performed at several sites. We propose a Bayesian
hierarchical model that allows us to determine if a set of amino acid
properties are being conserved or radically Changed at the codon
level. This approach can be used to jointly analyze a set of properties
and automatically adjusts for multiple comparisons in cases where
several amino acid sites are considered.

2 METHODS

2.1 Bayesian hierarchical model

We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model that compares amino acid
distances inferred from ancestral sequences derived from a given phylogeny
to distances expected under neutrality for a given set of amino acid properties.
We treat the distances as continuous variables, and so in this sense our model
is more related to the methods of Pupko et al. (2003) and McClellan et al.
(2005), than to the approaches of Sainudiin et al. (2005) and Wong et al.
(2006), since the latter require a predetermined partition of the amino acids
based on a property or a set of properties. The proposed hierarchical model
is site speciﬁc, allowing us to determine which sites show non-synonymous
mutations that either conserve or radically change a particular property while
properly adjusting for multiple comparisons if several sites are considered.
More speciﬁcally, the ‘expected’ distances (under neutrality) and the
‘observed’ distancesiinferred from the ancestral sequences derived from
the observed DNA alignment and a given phylogenyiare calculated for each
property and for each site showing non-synonymous substitutions. Following
Xia and Li (1998), we assume that each codon can mutate to one of at most
nine alternative codons through a single nucleotide change. Some of these
mutations are non-synonymous (changes to stop codons are ignored). The
number of non-synonymous mutations possible through a single nucleotide
change, corresponding to a particular codon k, is denoted by Nk (k = 1 :61).
The absolute difference in property j between non-synonymous codon pairs
at site i differing at one codon position is denoted by l, with l: 1 :Nk. Let
F denote the frequency of codon k at site i in the alignment under study.
Then, the expected mean distance for site i and property j is deﬁned by:

61 i Nk 111'
klek [lekJ

221:1]: iNk
which is the weighted average of the differences due to possible non-
synonymous changes for a codon by looking at substitutions that result from
a single nucleotide mutation.

Once the ancestral sequences at all the internal nodes are obtained
under a speciﬁc substitution model and a prespeciﬁed tree, the observed
distances for each physicochemical property are calculated as follows. First,
non-synonymous substitutions are counted by comparing DNA sequences
between two neighboring nodes in the phylogeny. Then, the observed mean
distance, yingDlo’], for site i and property j is taken as the mean absolute
difference in property j due to all observed non-synonymous substitutions at
that site. Only sites which show at least one non-synonymous change at the
ancestral level are retained for further analysis. Then, Equation (1) is used
to compute the xiJ-s only for such sites.

The hierarchical regression model relates xigj to ij. The underlying idea
is that if site i is neutral with respect to property j, then the observed mean
distance at such site, )1“, should not be very different from the expected mean
distance at the same site, XL]: On the other hand, if yw- <<x,»,j, property j is
being conserved at site i, and if yigj >>xigj property j is radically changing
at site 1'. Additionally, in order to compare different properties and sites, x”-
and yigj are standardized by dividing them by the maximum possible distance
for each property. This allows us to use a common prior distribution on the

_ iJ
Xi,j=DE :

(1)

parameters associated to the properties as will be described below. Let x?) and
ya. be the standardized expected and observed mean distances, respectively.
Then, for each site i and property j with i = 1 :I and j = 1 :1, we consider the
model

>l< >l<
Yip} =5i,jxi,j +6113

with

N(O, :72 M?) otherwise.

To understand why we use this mixture for the error distribution, note that
some of the yxjs can be equal to zero since some of the non-synonymous
changes can result in no difference in the value of the property being
measured (e.g. both Phenylalanine and Isoleucine have the same value
under Grantham Polarity). We, therefore, approximate a point mass at
zero with a suitably tight prior on K2 = VZIUjijl/gij = 0). Also, since the
number of observed non-synonymous changes can be very different for
different sites, Var(y:j|ﬁi,j 7&0)=:72/ni0, where nio is the observed number
of non-synonymous changes at site i.

The next level of the hierarchy considers a mixture prior on [3” with
point masses at 0 and 1, and a normal density. The point mass at 0 is used
to describe sites which are strongly conserved, i.e. those whose observed
mean distances are zero or very close to zero. The point mass at 1 is used
to model sites that are believed to be neutral with respect to a particular
property. Finally, those [Em-s that are not 0 or 1 can be less than 1 or greater
than 1, and so a normal density is chosen to model such sites a priori. Thus,
the structure on [3” is

{N(O,K2) if jaw-=0
61]"

ﬁg ~ 71130 1(,3,~y,:0) +71“ 1(,3,~y,:1) +JTi,2N(Olj~ 112).

with 71,»; = 1 —J'r,»,0 — 71,», 1 . The mixture probabilities and the variances on the
Gaussian components are assumed to be the same across properties but are
site speciﬁc, while the means are assumed to depend exclusively on the
properties. This structure is used for two reasons. First, at least a priori and
even under the assumption of neutrality, the variability of the changes for
a given amino acid property may be Viewed as site dependent due to, for
example, functional constraints, while the mean of the Gaussian distribution
is thought as the average coefﬁcient for a given property. Second, using the
same 011- across sites for a given property and the same mixture probabilities
and variance, 739,71“ ,J'rm and r2, across properties for each site allows
us to borrow strength across sites and properties for estimation purposes,
improving our ability to detect changes. In other words, data from all the sites
are used to obtain estimates of 011- and data from all the properties are used
to estimate the site-speciﬁc parameters. This allows us to consider several
properties within a single model instead of conducting separate analyses for
each one.

The ﬁnal level of the model corresponds to the priors on the mixture
probabilities, the scale parameters and the means of the Gaussian priors. In
order to simplify computations, these priors are chosen to be conditionally
conjugate, i.e. (JILQJTLLJTLQ) ~ Dirichlet(a0,a1,a2), 011- ~ N(ma,Ca), I?
~ |G(cx,,ﬁr), [(2 ~ |G(cxK,/3K) and :72 ~ |G(ag,ﬁg), with hyperpararneters
80,81,ag,ma,Ca,ar,ﬁr,aK,/3K,ag and [36 set as follows. We assume apriori
that most of the sites are neutral (ﬁg 2 1), so we assign a fairly large weight
to this category, and equal weights to the probabilities of [3“ being zero and
being different from zero and one. Thus, we use a Dirichlet(1. 4, 1) prior
for the 71s which assigns about 67% weight to the probability of a site being
neutral and about 16.5% weight to each of the other two categories. We also
assume all the properties to be neutral a priori, so all the ozjs were given
the same prior mean ma = 1 and the same prior variance C0, = 0.25. K2 was
believed to be smaller a priori than :72, so we assign prior means of 0.01
and 0.1 and use |G(2,100) and |G(2,10), respectively, as the priors for these
parameters. The fizs are given |G(2,100) priors with prior means of 0.01.

An additional advantage of our hierarchical speciﬁcation is that it allows us
to automatically control the error rate associated with multiple comparisons.
Two conditions need to be satisﬁed before a Bayesian approach can claim
that posterior inference adjusts for multiplicities (Scott and Berger, 2003).

In the context of our model, these are the following: (i) the model needs to
assign a positive prior probability of site 1' showing 13“ = 0 or 13“ = 1; and (ii)
these prior probabilities cannot be ﬁxed, rather they have to come from some
distribution. However, some care is necessary when eliciting hierarchical
priors. The results from our sensitivity analyses in Section 3.2 suggest that
the prior that affects the results most is the prior on Its. Increasing the prior
probability that a site is not neutral (i.e. increasing the prior probabilities for
71,30 and 711,2) increases the posterior probability of the site being not neutral.
We suggest the use of a prior that assigns most of the probability mass to
each site being neutral, such as the Dirichlet(1. 4, 1), unless there is strong
prior evidence suggesting otherwise. For the variance terms (:72, K2 and r2),
we suggest using priors with small values for the mean, since the variance
in the data is usually small. Increasing the prior mean for the variance terms
means we add more uncertainty in our model, which might not be feasible
for all scenarios.

Posterior estimation of the model parameters is achieved Via Gibbs
sampling (e.g. Gamerman and Lopes, 2006). Chains were run for 20000
burn-in iterations, followed by 200000 sampling iterations. The sampling
iterations were thinned by a factor of 20 to reduce correlation, resulting in
effective sample sizes of 10 000 posterior draws. Convergence was assessed
by monitoring parameter trace plots. No convergence problems were detected
in any of the runs. For details about the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithm please refer to the Appendix.

2.2 Data and other methods

2.2.] Data We apply the proposed models to the following datasets:
an alignment of six class I alleles of the human major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) and an alignment of the sperm lysin protein for 25 abalone
species. In addition, a simulation study and the analysis of lysozyme gene
sequences in primates are included in the Appendix.

MHC: these data comprise six class I MHC alleles from HLA-A and HLA-
B loci with 365 codons. Sites with gaps were removed, ﬁnally resulting in
362 codons. These sequences were previously shown to be under positive
selection by Swanson et al. (2001).

Lyst'n: these data consist of cDNA from 25 abalone species with 135
codons. Several sites have been labeled as positively selected using codon
substitution models that allow a) to vary among amino acid sites (Yang et al.,
2000b). Sites with gaps were removed which resulted in 122 codons for the
analysis presented here.

We compare the results obtained Via the Bayesian hierarchical models
with those obtained using TreeSAAP and the methods of Sainudiin et al.
(2005) and Wong et al. (2006). We consider ﬁve properties: hydropathy,
isoelectric point, two measures of Polarity (Grantham and Zimmerman)
and volume. These were obtained from the amino acid index database
at http://www.genome.jp/aaindex. Many more properties can be included,
however, our aim is to illustrate the methodology using a small number of
properties.

In order to account for uncertainty in the tree and in the ancestral
sequences, we analyze data derived from 25 neighbor-joining (NJ) trees
for each of the two alignments.The 25 NJ phylogeniesiobtained from
the R package markovjumpsiare based on the methods of O’Brien
et al. (2009) that calculate labeled distances (e.g. synonymous and non-
synonymous distances) between sequences by ‘robust counting”, i.e. by
building on a reversible continuous-time Markov chain model of substitution.
Robustness is achieved by conditioning on pairwise site patterns to obtain
the conditional mean numbers of labeled substitutions and then by averaging
the conditional expectations over the empirical distribution of site patterns
from the observed sequences. For datasets with more sequences, one might
need to look at a larger number of trees. However, in our case, MHC and
lysin have 6 and 25 sequences, respectively. Phylogenies obtained Via the
Bayesian methods implemented in MrBayes (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck,
2003) were also considered. The Bayesian approach to phylogeny estimation
leads to samples from the posterior distribution of trees and so, we considered
the ﬁve phylogenies with the largest posterior probabilities and the consensus

tree reported by MrBayes. MHC had only six different topologies out of
the 25 NJ trees. Bayesian phylogenetic inference in these data provided a
single topology with 0.99 posterior probability. Furthermore, this topology
is precisely one the six different NJ topologies. For lysin, all the 25 NJ
topologies were different but a large number of them were very similar.
The ﬁve trees with the highest posterior probabilities and the consensus
tree obtained from MrBayes were also similar to some of the NJ trees.
Given that the MrBayes phylogenies are identical or very similar to the NJ
phylogenies for the two datasets, we only report analyses based on the latter.
The hierarchical models are not tied to a particular method to estimate the
phylogeny and the ancestral sequences, and so the user can simply apply
the models to data derived from any prespeciﬁed set of phylogenies and
ancestral sequences.

The NJ trees obtained from markovj umps (based on non-synonymous
distances) were used to generate 25 sets of ancestral sequences under model
M8 in codeml implemented in PAML, Version 3.15 (Yang, 1997). The 25
sets of ancestral sequences were then taken as inputs for the hierarchical
regressions, i.e. observed distances were computed for each of the 25 sets
of ancestral sequences and separate regressions were ﬁt. For each of the
two alignments, we also performed regression analyses that combined the
observed distances by taking a weighted average of the yiJ-s from the 25
sets of ancestral sequences. Finally, hierarchical analyses of the ancestral
sequences obtained using the maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny for the
MHC data and the phylogeny of Lee et al. (1995) (used in Yang et al., 2000b)
for lysin were also performed.

For both datasets, and for each set of ancestral sequences, positively and
negatively selected sites were identiﬁed using the codon substitution model
M8 in PAML, in which a discretized beta distribution models a) values
between zero and one with probability [70, while an additional positive
selection category with w> 1 and probability [7] models positive selection.
Sites were identiﬁed as positively selected if the Bayes-empirical-Bayes
posterior probability (Yang et al., 2005) of belonging to this last category
was greater than 0.95 and as negatively selected if Pr(w > 1| data) < 0.5
and a?) < 0.3, where a?) is the estimated posterior mean.

2.2.2 Other methods In addition to looking at results obtained Via the
Bayesian hierarchical models for sites classiﬁed as positively selected using
w-based methods, we also compare such results to two approaches that
take physicochemical properties into account. Speciﬁcally, we applied the
methods of McClellan et al. (2005) implemented in TreeSAAP version 3.2
(Woolley et al., 2003) and the methods of Sainudiin et al. (2005) and Wong
et al. (2006) implemented in codemlz in PAML, 3.14z and EvoRadical,
respectively.

TreeSAAP implements the modiﬁed MM01 model of McClellan and
McCracken (2001), which is outlined in McClellan et al. (2005). In
model MM01, each non-synonymous substitution is assigned to one of
M categories, with categories indexed by lower numbers corresponding to
sites with more conservative changes for a given property, and those indexed
by higher numbers corresponding to sites displaying radical changes. In
the analyses presented here, we considered M = 4 categories indicating,
respectively, conservative changes (m = 1), moderate changes (m = 2), radical
changes (m = 3) and very radical changes (m = 4). Non-synonymous changes
were inferred from the ancestral reconstruction obtained Via the reversible
nucleotide substitution model in baseml (no codon substitution models are
implemented in the current version of TreeSAAP). The ML phylogeny and
the phylogeny of Lee et al. (1995) were used for the MHC and lysin data,
respectively. Each of the non-synonymous changes was assigned to one of
the magnitude categories for each of the ﬁve properties being considered.
In order to test the hypothesis of neutrality, McClellan et al. (2005) divide
the number of inferred amino acid replacements per magnitude category for
a given property by the number of evolutionary pathways assigned to that
category to obtain a set of proportions, pm for m = 1 :M. Under neutrality, it is
expected that these proportions are equal to the overall mean. McClellan et al.
(2005) test neutrality for each property using z-scores. Site-speciﬁc z-scores
are also provided, however, they do not adjust for multiple comparisons.

Assessing the selective influence of amino acid properties

 

More recently, Sainudiin et al. (2005) and Wong et al. (2006) developed
codon substitution models that incorporate changes in amino acid properties.
In these approaches, amino acids are ﬁrst partitioned on the basis of a
particular property. This partition is then used to pararneterize the rates of
property-conserving and property-altering codon substitutions using a ML
framework. Sainudiin et al. (2005) divide substitutions into two groups:
synonymous and property-conserving non-synonymous substitutions, and
property-altering non-synonymous substitutions. Wong et al. (2006) gen-
eralize the idea to allow three classes: synonymous, property-conserving
non-synonymous and property-altering non-synonymous substitutions. The
latter model can determine the type of selective pressure acting on aparticular
property of interest, while accounting for the non-speciﬁc selective pressure
at the amino acid level. The results reported in both these papers are based
on posterior probabilities computed Via the naive empirical Bayes method
(Nielsen and Yang, 1998).

3 RESULTS
3.1 MHC

Table 1 displays the posterior means of the proportions of sites where
each of the ﬁve properties are strongly conserved (ﬂ = 0), conserved
(0 < £3 < 1), neutral (5 = 1) orradically Changed (5 > 1). These results
were obtained by ﬁtting the hierarchical model to the combined
distances from the 25 sets of ancestral sequences. Very similar
results are obtained from ﬁtting 25 separate hierarchical models, one
per set of ancestral sequences, and also from ﬁtting a hierarchical
model to the ancestral sequences obtained from the ML tree. For
all the properties except polarity-Z—which shows essentially equal
proportions in the ﬁrst two categories—the majority of the sites show
substitutions that are neutral. In addition, non-neglible proportions
of sites either do not alter the property (5 = 0) or radically Change it.

Table 2 lists the sites in MHC in domains I, II and III for
which Pr(f3l-J~ 750 and ﬂisj 7E 1|data) is maximized in at least one of
the 25 regression analyses. We Choose to label sites according to
the categories for which the posterior probabilities are maximized
because it is the standard rule in Classiﬁcation problems and it leads
to good sensitivity and speciﬁcity rates (see the simulation study and
ﬁlrther discussion in the Appendix). Sites in bold also maximized
such probability in the combined regression. Furthermore, all of the
sites listed are such that Pr(f3,-SJ~ > 1| data) was maximum. No sites
were found to maximize the probability of belonging to the third
category for volume. Comparing Table 2 with the results in Sainudiin
et al. (2005) and Wong et al. (2006), we see that these authors found
the following sites to have signiﬁcant probability of showing radical
Changes: site 116 under their polarity partition, and sites 63, 67 and
97 under their volume partition. These were the sites identiﬁed by

Table 1. Posterior estimates of the proportion of sites with [3:0, 13: 1,

the naive empirical Bayes method. However, on using the Bayes-
empirieal-Bayes method only site 45 had a signiﬁcant probability
of showing radical Changes under the polarity partition, and no sites
were signiﬁcant under the volume partition. In addition, sites 114
and 156 were found to be under positive selection using w-based
methods. Using the hierarchical approach, we ﬁnd that sites 45, 63,
116 and 156 radically Change hydropathy, polarity-G or polarity-Z.
Therefore, even though there are similarities between our results and
those in Sainudiin et al. (2005) and Wong et a1. (2006), there are
also some discrepancies. However, it should be emphasized that the
methods of Sainudiin et al. (2005) and Wong et al. (2006) strongly
depend on the partition Chosen by the user and so, they are not
directly comparable with the hierarchical approaches presented here
since the latter use amino acid distances directly.

Analyzing the MHC data with TreeSAAP, which uses ancestral
sequences obtained from baseml and the ML phylogeny, we found
that the hypothesis of neutrality could not be rejected (i.e. none
of the z-seores were signiﬁcant) for any of the ﬁve properties. In
order to compare our method with TreeSAAP, we performed an
additional hierarchical regression analysis using distance data from
these ancestral sequences. Our results are very similar to those
obtained with the eodon-based models and shown in Table 1, i.e. it
was found that although a majority of the sites show neutral Changes,
each property has a considerable proportion of sites in the other
categories (5 = 0, 0 < £3 < 1 and f3 > 1) taken together. The fact that
Tree SAAP does not ﬁnd any property to be conserved or radically
Changing is probably related to the fact that the z-seores are based
on all the sites. In contrast, one of the advantages of the hierarchical
approach is that it is site speciﬁc and so, even if the Changes are
neutral or conserve a given property on average, some of the sites
may show mutations that radically Change such property.

3.2 Lysin

Table 3 shows posterior estimates of the proportions of sites
with 5:0, 5: 1, 0 < £3 < 1 and f3 > 1, respectively, based on
the combined distances from the 25 sets of ancestral sequences.
About 64—70% of the sites lie in the neutral category (f3: 1) for
hydropathy, isoeleetric point, polarity-G and volume, while polarity-
Z has 53% of sites in this category. Hydropathy, isoleetrie point,
polarity-G and volume are also fairly comparable in terms of the
percentages of sites (15—20%) that show non-synonymous mutations
that strongly conserve these properties (5:0), while ~29% of the
sites are showing non-synonymous mutations that strongly conserve
polarity-Z.

Fig. 1. Posterior summaries of 43st from the combined analysis for lysin.

The posterior densities of Olj for the ﬁve properties are shown in
Figure 1. Recall that Olj is mean of the Gaussian distributions used
to model the 5,-1js that are different from zero and one and so, Olj is
a measure of the average behavior for the property based on sites
whose Changes conserve it orradically Change it (0 < 5 < 1 or 5 > 1).
The ﬁgure shows that the distributions of Olj for isoeleetric point and
polarity-G are roughly centered at one, and so on average Changes
are neutral with respect to these properties. The distributions for
hydropathy and polarity-Z have most of the mass above 1, consistent
with radical Changes. Finally, the distribution for volume is skewed
to the right, with more mass below 1, consistent with Changes that
conserve the property. Results from the analysis done using the
ancestral sequences obtained from model M8 in codeml and the
tree of Lee et a1. (1995) are essentially the same as those summarized
in Table 3 and Figure 1. Results obtained from the 25 separate
regressions are also very similar for volume in that the proportions
of sites in the different categories are comparable with those shown
in Table 3 and Figure 1. This suggests that tree uncertainty does not
affect the overall trends in lysin for volume. For the remaining four
properties, the proportions of sites in the strongly conserved and

neutral categories remain fairly similar to the combined analysis for
all 25 regressions. However, the results for the categories describing
conserved or radical Changes seem to be affected by phylogenetic
and ancestral sequence uncertainty. In particular, for hydropathy
16 of the 25 regressions have results similar to Table 3 but in the
remaining 9 regressions, it had 9—11% of sites in the conserved
category. In the cases of isoeleetric point and the two measures of
polarity, 9 and 11 of the 25 regressions, respectively, had results
similar to the combined analysis. For the remaining regressions,
about 15—16% sites showed Changes conserving isoelectric point,
14—17% sites showed Changes conserving polarity-G and 15—18%
sites showed Changes conserving polarity-Z.

In terms of site-speciﬁc results, Table 4 lists the sites that
maximize the probability of 5” being different from 0 or 1, in at
least one out of the 25 regressions and in the combined regression.
Isoelectric point, polarity-G and volume did not show any sites that
maximize such probability in the combined data. Sites identiﬁed
as positively selected using w-based methods appear in bold. In this
case, all the sites listed also maximize the probability of 5 > 1 and so,
these sites show substitutions that radically Change hydropathy and
polarity-Z. It is also possible to obtain informative graphical displays
that summarize site-speciﬁc behavior for a particular property. For
instance, Figure 2 plots the information obtained from the posterior
samples of 5H for the combined analysis under polarity-Z for those
sites which had signiﬁcant posterior probability of being different
from 0 or 1. The medians and the central 95% credible intervals
(vertical lines) from the posterior samples of 5” which are different
from 0 and 1 are shown. All of the sites show radical Changes
(posterior intervals are above 1) using the hierarchical approach,
but only sites 70, 87 and 127—which are Clustered at the top of the
molecule in Figure 3—are identiﬁed as positively selected by model
M8 in PAML. Also, some of the sites identiﬁed as positively selected
using w-based methods are neutral or strongly conserve polarity-Z.
Speciﬁcally, Figure 3 highlights the sites found to be under positive
selection according to model M8 in PAML using the phylogeny of
Lee et a1. (1995). Among these sites, sites 70, 87 and 127, show
mutations that radically Change polarity-Z. Sites 33 and 64 were
found to show non-synonymous mutations that strongly conserve
polarity-Z, and the remaining sites were identiﬁed as neutral with
respect to this property.

Wong et al. (2006) also analyzed the lysin data using different
partitions for polarity and volume and identiﬁed sites that were under
speciﬁc selective pressures for the different properties. Once again
we emphasize that the results presented here and those in Wong
et al. (2006) are not directly comparable because the latter approach
uses partitions and the hierarchical models use distances, and so, it

is possible that a large difference in the actual value of the property
is ignored or a small difference magniﬁed while constructing the
categories. For example, under the volume partition, Wong et al.
(2006) Classify both glycine and valine as small and glutamine
as large, whereas for us their volume scores were 3, 84 and 85
respectively. Thus, Wong et a1. (2006) would say that a Change
between glutamine and valine alters the property while a mutation
between glycine and valine does not, even though the difference
between glutamine and valine volume scores is much smaller than
the difference between the glycine and valine scores.

The lysin sequences were also analyzed using Tree SAAP.
Table 5 shows a Tree SAAP output that lists the signiﬁcant
amino acid properties based on z-scores. From this table, we can
conclude that hydropathy and isoeleetric point show signiﬁcantly
smaller proportions of very radical and radical Changes, respectively.
Polarity-G shows a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of moderate
Changes, and lower proportions of radical and very radical Changes.
Volume shows a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of Changes that
conserve the property, and lower proportions of moderate and very
radical Changes. Therefore, volume seems to be conserved. The
absence of a property (or category) implies that no signiﬁcant
departures from neutrality are found, and so there is no signiﬁcant
deviation from the assumption of selective neutrality for polarity-Z.
To compare our results with those of TreeSAAP, we performed
a hierarchical analysis using data derived from the same ancestral
sequences used by TreeSAAP (obtained using baseml). Posterior
estimates of the proportions of sites with 5 =0, 5 = 1, 0 < 5 < 1 and
5 > 1 for the ﬁve properties (data not shown) are similar to those in
Table 3. Speciﬁcally, volume shows the largest percentage of sites
(~30%) lying in the strongly conserved and conserved categories,
and the smallest percentage of sites (~1%) in the radically Changing
category. These average results agree with those obtained from
Tree SAAP.

4 DISCUSSION

We present a Bayesian hierarchical regression model that allows
us to detect radical amino acid Changes that could facilitate
the identiﬁcation of adaptations by quantifying the magnitude of
Changes in amino acid properties. The model is ﬂexible, with the
following main features: (i) it provides global results, i.e. point
estimates and associated uncertainties of the posterior probabilities
of the proportions of sites that are neutral, highly conserved,

conserved or radically Changing with respect to a particular property
can be obtained; (ii) it provides site-speciﬁc results, i.e. the approach
can identify sites showing mutations that radically Change or
strongly conserve a particular property, even in cases where the
mutations are neutral on average. This is an important improvement
over models that detect selection only in cases where it leads to an
excess in the total number of radical Changes, since essentially these
methods average over all sites; (iii) the hierarchical speciﬁcations
of the priors ensure that the models and methods presented here
properly account for multiple comparisons when a large number
of amino acid sites are analyzed; (iv) the prior speciﬁcation allows
borrowing of information across sites and properties for estimation
purposes which leads to higher power with respect to approaches
that analyze sites or properties individually (Zhang and Cao, 2009);
(v) the hierarchical structure also preserves the parsimony of the
model; indeed, hierarchical priors induce correlations across model
parameters that reduce the number of effective parameters in the
model and prevent overﬁtting without hindering model ﬂexibility
(for ﬁlrther discussion and two examples see Gelman et al., 1996
and Zhu and Hero, 2007).

The methods in Sainudiin et al. (2005) and Wong et al. (2006)
are also site-speciﬁc but, unlike those proposed here, they rely
on prespeeiﬁed partitions of the amino acids according to some
physicochemical property and so, the results are highly dependent on
the partition being used. Our hierarchical models are more similar to
methods based on amino acid distances, such as those of McClellan
et al. (2005). However, as mentioned above, the hierarchical models
properly handle the multiple comparison problem when several sites
are considered.

The proposed hierarchical approach assumes that the phylogeny
underlying the sequences is known, and that a speciﬁc model of
sequence evolution is used to generate the ancestral sequences.
This is also true for the methods we compared with, such as
those implemented in Tree SAAP, or those in Pupko et al. (2003)
and Sainudiin et al. (2005). When there is uncertainty regarding
the phylogeny and/or the evolutionary model used to generate
the ancestral sequences, such uncertainty needs to be taken into
account. One way of doing so is by performing hierarchical analyses
with data obtained from several of the most likely phylogenies
and/or evolutionary models and seeing if the results are sensitive
with respect to these parameters. This was the route we took
here by considering hierarchical analyses of data obtained under
different phylogenies. A more robust way of dealing with this
would be extending the regression models to consider phylogenetic
uncertainty. This will be explored in the future, however, it is also
worth mentioning that such approaches would be computationally
intensive (Huelsenbeek et al., 2000).

The regression methods presented here complement traditional
w-based methods for detecting molecular adaptation by providing a
qualitative assessment of the amino acid Changing mutations with
respect to a speciﬁc set of physicochemical properties. When both
methods are combined, it is possible to determine which sites among
those labeled as positively selected using w-based methods are
showing radical Changes with respect to a given property. Based
on the analyses presented here, we see that in some cases, sites
that have a large number of non-synonymous substitutions, and are
therefore identiﬁed as positively selected, may conserve a given
property. Conversely, sites showing a relatively small number of
substitutions, possibly Classiﬁed as neutral or negatively selected,

may show substitutions that radically Change a given property. If
such Changes are advantageous to the protein function, then these
sites could be targets for natural selection (Sainudiin et al., 2005).
Thus, the regression methods can be viewed as complementary to
any eodon-based methods, providing additional information about
putative molecular adaptations that could be further explored.

The analyses presented here use a small number of properties that
do not appear to be highly correlated in terms of the observed (and
expected) distances for the alignments considered. However, the
amino acid index database has a very large number of properties,
many of which are highly correlated. The hierarchical regression
framework can be extended to handle a large number of possibly
correlated amino acid properties by incorporating a factor structure.
Factor models explain the variability in the data in terms of
a smaller number of unobserved variables called factors. The
idea is similar to that of principal component analysis. We will
consider such extensions in the near future. For the time being,
we suggest using the hierarchical regression model with a small
number of relevant properties. The properties can be Chosen based
on preliminary principal component analysis or other relevant
biological information.

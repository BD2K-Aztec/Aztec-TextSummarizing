ABSTRACT

Motivation: Cancer encompasses various diseases associated
with loss of cell cycle control, leading to uncontrolled cell
proliferation and/or reduced apoptosis. Cancer is usually caused
by malfunction(s) in the cellular signaling pathways. Malfunctions
occur in different ways and at different locations in a pathway.
Consequently, therapy design should first identify the location and
type of malfunction to arrive at a suitable drug combination.
Results: We consider the growth factor (GF) signaling pathways,
widely studied in the context of cancer. Interactions between different
pathway components are modeled using Boolean logic gates. All
possible single malfunctions in the resulting circuit are enumerated
and responses of the different malfunctioning circuits to a ‘test’ input
are used to group the malfunctions into classes. Effects of different
drugs, targeting different parts of the Boolean circuit, are taken into
account in deciding drug efficacy, thereby mapping each malfunction
to an appropriate set of drugs.

1 INTRODUCTION

In eukaryotic multicellular organisms, life is sustained by a
systematic coordination between different cells and all extracellular
signals. Each cell has its own functionality and its future is
determined by various intrinsic and extrinsic biological signals.
For instance, a cell’s proliferation, differentiation or induction of
apoptosis are determined by a number of different signals. From the
time of a cell’s birth (by division of its parent cell), the cell’s state is
tightly controlled by different biological regulations. Cell signaling
is a form of communication between different cells. These signals
can be chemical or electrical impulses. Communication via electrical
impulses is typically associated with nerve cells (neurons), which
are attached to each other and the action potential transmits from
neuron to neuron. For general somatic cells, proteins are usually
the signaling molecules used for communication. The interactions
between the different signaling molecules are multivariate in nature
and hence difﬁcult to study. As a result, historically biologists have
focussed on studying the marginal interaction between the signaling
molecules, leading to what is called pathway information. Although
pathway knowledge cannot provide the complete multivariate
picture of the overall cellular signal transduction, it is clear that one
has to have a mechanism for incorporating this prior information
into any signal transduction model that one develops. A procedure

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

to do precisely that was recently developed in Layek et al. (2011).
In that paper, tools from digital system design were used to generate
Boolean networks consistent with given pathway information.
Furthermore, it was shown using a speciﬁc biological example that
a network designed using that approach could replicate relevant
experimentally observed behavior from the published literature.

In this article, our goal is to go a few steps further. Here, we
are not content with just producing a Boolean network model from
given pathway information. Instead our objective is to utilize such
a model to (i) enumerate all the possible fault scenarios; (ii) use the
response of the model to a test input to determine which fault or
class of faults has occurred; and (iii) ﬁnally use this information to
prescribe an appropriate therapeutic action. To keep the discussion
biologically focussed, we will consider the speciﬁc case of growth
factor (GF) signaling pathways.

The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, pathways and
networks are deﬁned in a formal way. In Section 3, cancer is modeled
as faults in the underlying signaling network. In Section 4, drug
therapies are modeled as interventions to alter aberrant network
behavior emanating from a fault. Section 5 gives a biological
example showing the power of our methodology. Speciﬁcally, fault
classiﬁcation and intervention results for our example are presented.
Finally, Section 6 contains some concluding remarks.

2 FROM PATHWAYS TO NETWORKS

From a systems viewpoint, the behavior of a living cell is analogous
to that of a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) feedback system.
Although the actual protein concentrations in the cell are continuous
variables, there are at least three reasons why a discrete type of
modeling would be preferred. First, although the continuous model
may dictate the exact dynamics, using the current technology it is
impossible to reliably measure the concentration of each protein
inside the cell in real time. Second, many of the genes/proteins inside
the cell exhibit ON/OFF switch-like behavior, which is more readily
accommodated using quantization within the digital domain (Jacob
and Monod, 1961; Loriferne, 1982). Third, the discrete-time systems
are easier to analyze, model and control in real time in comparison
to continuous-time systems (Kuo, 1977). In the next subsection,
we introduce Boolean networks (BNs) that constitute a popular
framework for discrete-time, discrete-space modeling of biological
systems including genetic regulatory networks. In addition, we
formally deﬁne signaling pathways.

(genes/proteins) V={x1,...,x,,}, xi e{0, l}, i: l,...,n, and a list F=
(fl,...,fn), of Boolean functions, fi:{0,l}"+m—> {0, l}, i=l,...,n,
m 3 0 is the number of external inputs e.g. GFs, stresses, metabolites,
etc. Each node xi represents the state/expression of the gene 1', where
xi=0 means that gene/protein i is OFF (unexpressed or inactive
according to their biological signiﬁcance) and xi=l means that
gene/protein i is ON (expressed or active). The function fl- is called
the predictor ﬁmction for gene/protein 1'. Updating the states of
all genes/proteins in B is done synchronously at every time step
according to their predictor functions. If the predictor functions are
known, the dynamics of the BN will solely depend on the set of
input variables. The dynamic behavior of the BN is quite different
in the presence of different external inputs. For m different external
inputs, we can model the dynamical system as 2’” different closed
BNs, each one of which we may deﬁne as a ‘context’. The switching
between contexts here occurs in response to changes in the activity
status of external input variables and is, therefore, deterministic. A
stochastic View of context switching has been adopted in several
earlier papers, for instance Pal et al. (2005); Xiao and Dougherty
(2006).

In this article, the starting point is the theoretical construction
of context sensitive BNs or input—output BNs from the known
biological knowledge of signal transduction pathways. Toward this

t:a,b
end, we deﬁne the term pathway segment A—>B to mean that
if gene/protein A assumes the value a6 {0, 1} then gene/protein B
transitions to be {0, l} in no more than t subsequent time steps. A

pathway is deﬁned to be a sequence of pathway segments of the form

t :a,b t62b’),C . .
A 1—>1 B ‘—‘> C. A systematic general procedure for generating a

family of BNs consistent with a set of given signaling pathways,
or minor variations thereof, is presented in Layek et al. (2011).
This procedure makes use of standard techniques from digital
systems design such as Kamaugh maps (Kamaugh, 1953). Anetwork
generated by such a procedure could form the starting point for
the exposition of the results of this article, although the speciﬁc
biological example considered here does not require the use of this
machinery.

3 MODELING CANCER AS FAULTS IN THE
SIGNALING NETWORK

In molecular biology, the marginal behavior of the normal cell
is described using signaling pathways. BNs represent a paradigm
that can be used to incorporate this information to model the
overall dynamic behavior of the cell, consistent with the pathway
knowledge. However, the translational motivation behind this type
of dynamical modeling is to facilitate corrective intervention when
the cell behaves abnormally. Cancer is actually a disease of several
faults in the network. A ‘fault’ is deﬁned by any structural error of
the physical system, such that the dynamics become aberrant. For
example, the accumulation of point mutations in the genomic DNA
may cause the signaling pathways to behave erratically leading to
proliferation. On the other hand, sometimes the fault may not be
in the genetic code of a particular protein, but rather it is in the
protein synthesis factory ribosome, or in some control mechanism
of alternative splicing. The fault could also be in the chromosomal
spindle resulting in unequal splitting of the chromosomal DNA
between the two daughter cells during cell division. Any of these
different kinds of errors could cause structural changes in the

regulatory network, thereby changing its dynamics and steady-state
behavior. In this section, we try to model different types of biological
errors within the BN (digital electronics) framework. In a BN, the
faults can be broadly divided into two types.

0 Stuck-at fault: A stuck-at fault means that a point in the
network circuitry is stuck to a particular value. As a result,
the incoming information is no longer communicated beyond
the faulty point; instead, only the stuck-at value is passed on
to the outgoing port. Clearly, stuck-at faults can commonly
be of two types: ‘stuck-at-l’ faults and ‘stuck-at-0’ faults with
obvious interpretations. We next present an example to show
that modeling via stuck-at faults makes biological sense.

In the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways,
an important signaling protein kinase is the Ras protein. Ras is
phosphorylated by many upstream proteins (by GF-mediated
pathways). Once activated, Ras activates downstream proteins
that have transcriptional control on cyclin D1 and hence cell
cycle progression. However, the inherent enzymatic GTPase
activity of Ras hydrolyzes the active Ras—GTP complex into
the inactive Ras—GDP complex, so that Ras activity ceases
after some delay. However, if due to some mutations in the
Ras gene, the GTPase activity of the Ras protein is lost, the
once activated Ras protein will be constitutiver active and
will signal the downstream transcription causing proliferation
and cancer (Weinberg, 2006). This constitutive activation of
Ras can be modeled as a ‘stuck-at-l’ fault in the Ras node
of the BN model of the cell signal transduction. Indeed, the
‘stuck-at’ fault is a very common one in cancer biology. One
of the earliest ﬁndings of a very prevalent mutation in cancer
was the identiﬁcation of the Ras oncogene family members,
HRAS, KRAS and NRAS. These genes play a critical role in the
signaling that drives proliferation. KRAS genes constitutiver
activated by mutations are found at the very high rate of
17—25% in human cancers (Kranenburg, 2005).

0 Bridging fault: As the name suggests, a bridging fault refers
to the disruption of old interconnections and incorporation of
new interconnections in the network. Bridging faults also make
biological sense. The molecular signal transduction relies on
the sequences and 3D conformations of the molecules involved.
So, any variation in the sequence and 3D conformation of a
molecule (mainly protein) will alter its functionality. As aresult,
many pathways involving that molecule will become inactive
while the altered molecule may open up new ones. Without
any loss of generality, this kind of aberrant behavior could be
modeled as a bridging fault in the BN.

Indeed, the ‘bridging’ fault is also a common occurrence
in human cancers. A wide variety of tumor types
carry chromosomal translocations, where parts of different
chromosomes have been joined together. The ﬁrst such event
to be associated with a speciﬁc cancer is the Philadelphia
chromosome, a translocation joining chromosomes 9 and 22
(Nowell and Hungerford, 1960) and fusing the BCR and ABL
genes. The event makes the action of the Abl kinase constitutive
in its stimulation of proliferation and inhibition of DNA repair
and, if this happens in early blood cell progenitors in the bone
marrow, can cause chronic myelogenous leukemia. A variety
of drugs that inhibit this kinase activity can produce remission
of the disease.

Fig. 1. Stuck-at faults and bridging faults in a digital circuit.

Stuck-at faults and bridging faults are illustrated in Figure 1, where
a fault-free BN is shown in Figure 1a while the corresponding faulty
network is shown in Figure 1b.

Based on the preceding discussion, it is clear that cancer can
be broadly modeled as multiple stuck-at and bridging faults in the
ENS corresponding to the normal signaling pathways. In Abramovici
et al. (1990), extensive theoretical work on digital system testing
and fault modeling is presented, which the engineers have been
successﬁilly using for digital circuit testing for quite some time now.
One of the goals of this article is to use a similar approach for the
prediction of fault locations in cancerous networks and the design
of intervention policies to compensate for the effect of these faults.
For the sake of simplicity, we will focus only on single stuck-at
faults. The more general case of cancer modeling involving multiple
stuck-at and bridging faults will be taken up in ﬁiture publications.

3.1 Test inputs and fault detectability

In this article, we will primarily focus on the non-feedback input—
output modules of biological systems. Consider the BN of Figure 1a
that has four inputs and two outputs as shown. Now suppose that the
only possible fault in this network is the stuck-at-l fault shown in
Figure 1b. Following Abramovici et al. (1990), for a combinatorial
circuit (i.e. non-feedback BN) N, let Z(x) denote the output vector
for the input vector x. The presence of a fault f transforms N into
Nf with output ﬁinction Zf(x) for the same input vector x. We say
that a test vector t detects the fault f iff Zf(t) #Z (t). Clearly, for the
stuck-at-l fault in Figure 1b, the test input vector ABCD =0000
can detect the fault because, Z(0000)=01 while Zf(0000)=11.
However, the test input vector 1111 cannot detect the fault since
Z(1111) = Zf(1111) = 10. These ideas about fault detectability will
be applied to a biological example in Section 5.4.

4 MODELING DRUG INTERVENTION

In a cancerous network, identiﬁcation of the fault locations is only
a part of the task. The major challenge lies in ﬁnding the best
possible drug or drug combinations with which to intervene. From
a theoretical perspective, we can consider the non-cancerous and
cancerous (faulty) networks as two different boolean networks. In
general, it will be impossible to make a cancerous network revert to
the original non-cancerous one using any sort of drug intervention,
because the mutations leading to cancer are usually irreversible.

Instead, what the best drug combination could do is to nullify some
of the deadly effects (like constitutive cell division) of the cancerous
faulty system and try to kill the cell by inducing apoptosis.

The following modeling of drug intervention is inspired by the
biological effect of the drug on the pathways. A drug goes into the
cell to bind a particular kinase to deactivate its phosphorylating
capability. This means that the drug can cut the effect of that
particular kinase on molecules further downstream. Hence, the drug
can be modeled as an inverted input to an ‘AND’ gate at the target
point of the BN. This schematic modeling of drug intervention is
shown in Figure 2.

In this article, our goal is not to derive the mathematical
expression for the optimal drug intervention policy, since most
mathematically derived policies may be difﬁcult, or impossible, to
biochemically implement. Instead, our objective is to model known
and well-tested cancer drugs separately and then to ﬁnd the best
suboptimal combination of drugs for a particular cancerous network.
The method is described in detail in Section 5.5, where it is applied
to a biological example.

5 BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE: GFS AND CELLULAR
SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION

In multicellular eukaryotic organisms, the cell numbers are very
tightly controlled, and cells divide to form more cells only when
they receive signals from other cells directing them to do so. The
external signals that stimulate a cell to divide are usually called
GFS or mitogens. Normally, these are protein or steroid ligands. The
external signal directing a cell to divide is usually communicated to
the cell division machinery inside the cell through a transmembrane
protein called a GF receptor. These transmembrane proteins contain
the amino acid tyrosine and activate the cell division machinery
inside the cell by phosphorylating some key proteins; hence, they are
also sometimes referred to as receptor tyrosine kinases. Each growth
factor binds to its membrane-bound receptor with great speciﬁcity
and when that happens, an intracellular signaling cascade occurs that
can result in enhanced cell proliferation, enhanced protein synthesis
or inhibition of apoptosis. In this article, we will focus on the
signaling pathways associated with a number of growth factors.
One of the reasons for this choice is that these signaling pathways
have not only been widely studied in the context of cancer but
also different cancer drugs, known to affect different parts of the
pathways, are currently available.

Before presenting a detailed schematic diagram of the components
involved in these pathways and their interactions, it is appropriate

to ﬁrst brieﬂy review the eukaryotic cell cycle and point out how
malﬁinctions in the associated control system can lead to cancer.

5.1 Cell cycle control, DNA mutation and cancer

In a multicellular organism, cell growth and proliferation are tightly
controlled by the cell cycle control system. The typical eukaryotic
cell cycle has four phases called G1(Gap 1), S (Synthesis), G2(Gap
2) and M(Mitosis) as shown in Figure 3. The resting phase G0 is
a phase where the cell has made a decision (in the G1 phase) to
temporarily withdraw from the cell cycle. The G0 and G1 phases
are in equilibrium with each other so that a resting cell in the G0
phase can readily reenter the cell cycle, if the external conditions
require additional cells to be produced.

In the G1 phase, the cell processes all the extracellular signals
(through different pathways) and decides whether to go back to G0
or proceed toward the S or DNA synthesis phase. The R checkpoint
(see Fig. 3) is very critical in the cell cycle regulation. Once the
cell goes past the R checkpoint, the progression of the cell cycle no
longer depends on the mitogens (the growth factors or the inputs of
the transduction pathways). Cyclin—cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
complexes play major roles in the regulation of the cell cycle
dynamics. The growth factor activation of the receptor tyrosine
kinases results in rapid accumulation of Cyclin D1. Similarly in
normal cells, removal of growth factors results in rapid decline in
the Cyclin D1 level. This Cyclin D(1 or 2) and CDK4/6 complexes
carry the cell past the R checkpoint. Beyond this checkpoint,
although there are mechanisms to check for correct DNA replication
and proper apportioning of the chromosomes between the two
daughter cells, there are no more decisions made between whether
to remain in quiescence or to proceed to proliferation. Thus, after
the R checkpoint, the cell cycle is more or less automated and
independent of the extracellular inputs. In normal cells, if there
is no mitogen during the GOSGl transition, the cell will not
enter the S phase. However, in cancerous cells, the proto-oncogenes
can get mutated to become oncogenes. The translated oncoproteins
have 3D conformations, which are quite different from that of
the corresponding normal protein and can behave differently. For
instance, if Ras proto-oncogene mutates to Ras oncogene, the
encoded Ras oncoprotein can become constitutively active and start
perpetually signaling to the downstream proteins. In that case, even
if there is no mitogenic signaling from the outside, the cell will
be stimulated to divide. Similarly, mutation in pro-apoptotic genes

can stop apoptosis resulting in tumorigenesis. Since almost all the
genes/proteins along the important proliferation/apoptosis pathways
are prone to mutation, the number of possibilities for mutation
leading to cancer is quite large.

5.2 GF pathways and their boolean circuit modeling

The particular set of signaling pathways that we will focus on in
this article are the so-called GF pathways. Our goal is to model
these signaling pathways as an input—output Boolean circuit and to
use the latter for (i) enumerating the different fault (or malfunction)
possibilities, (ii) carrying out fault classiﬁcation and (iii) designing
the appropriate corrective action (or therapy). Such modeling
must necessarily be preceded by a biological understanding of
the different components of this pathway and their interactions.
Figure 4 is a schematic diagram showing the different components
of this pathway and their interactions, as currently understood
by biologists, for example the Kegg collection of pathways
(http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html) and the NIH BioCarta
collection of pathways (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Pathways/BioCarta
_Pathways). The input nodes in the diagram are the GFs (shown in
the rhombuses in Fig. 4). The external signals corresponding to the
GFs are transmitted through the kinase cascades and ﬁnally activate
the appropriate transcription factors. The black and red lines in the
diagram indicate relationships which are known to be activating
and inhibitory, respectively. Figure 4 also shows six different cancer
drugs (red boxes) and the points in the pathway where they are
believed to intervene. These signal transduction pathways in Figure 4
constitute a module in a larger tightly controlled network of cell
growth, cell division and metabolism.

Believing these pathways to be true, we can develop another level
of abstraction by modeling using BNs. For most of the pathways, the
modeling is trivial. Figure 5 describes the procedure quite clearly.
This modeling approach is quite intuitive and logical and can be
applied to the pathways in Figure 4 to arrive at Figure 6.

In the Boolean circuit shown in Figure 6, the seven outputs of
interest, shown at the bottom of the ﬁgure, are transcription factors
(marked in green) and the activation status of some key proteins
(not colored). As we will see, such a Boolean circuit model can
play an important role in understanding the proliferation versus

quiescence decision for a cell. Here, it is appropriate to point out that
in those cases where a detailed biological interaction diagram such
as Figure 4 is not supplied by biologists, one can use the approach
developed in Layek et al. (2011) to develop a Boolean network
starting from isolated pathway information.

5.3 Modeling faults and therapeutic interventions
using the Boolean circuit

Any mutation of any gene or post-transcriptional modiﬁcation of
the corresponding protein can constitutively turn ‘ON’ or ‘OFF’
that particular protein. This ﬁts in precisely within the stuck-at fault
paradigm considered in Section 3. For the sake of simplicity, in our
GF pathways case study, we will consider only single faults of the
stuck-at type. In addition, we will only consider the stuck-at faults,
which can lead to cancer. For the Boolean circuit shown in Figure 6,
the possible locations for the different stuck-at errors, which can
induce proliferation and stop apoptosis, are shown in Figure 7a.
The numbers are color coded to distinguish between the ‘stuck-at- 1’
and ‘stuck-at-O’ faults. Speciﬁcally, the black numerals refer to the
stuck-at-l faults while the red numerals refer to the stuck-at-0 faults.

As discussed in Section 4, a drug targets particular enzymes along
the pathways and cuts off the connectivity of that enzyme to the
downstream proteins. This connection cleavage can be achieved
via various mechanisms. For instance, the drug may have the
capability to bind a target protein and inhibit it from undergoing
phosphorylation. For our case study, we consider six potent cancer
drugs. Our objective here is not to study their detailed mechanisms
of action. Instead, we are interested in using the knowledge from
biologists to mark in their intervention locations and corresponding
activities on the Boolean circuit of Figure 6. This leads to the effects
shown in Figure 7b. Such pictorial representation of the drug activity
information is useful.

For instance, let us consider the drug ‘lapatinib’ which is known
to work on EGFR, ERBB2, EFGR or ERBB3 by inhibiting the
signaling capabilities of these receptor tyrosine kinases. From
Figure 7b, one can conclude that the drug ‘lapatinib’ will likely
be responsive for the treatment of cancers caused by mutations in
the receptor tyrosine kinases although it will probably be ineffective
against cancers caused by mutations in the Ras protein, which lies
further downstream. Two central objectives of this article are as
follows: (i) to use the information contained in Figure 7a to group the
numbered faults into different classes; and (ii) to use the information
in Figure 7b to predict which set of drugs/drug combinations would
be most effective against a particular fault. These objectives are
pursued in the next two subsections.

5.4 Fault analysis and classiﬁcation

From Figure 7a, we see that there are 24 possible fault locations.
Alternatively, we could have arrived at the fault locations based on
our biological understanding. As already indicated, in this article we
will be conﬁning ourselves to the analysis of single faults only. So,
for our purposes, the fault can be any one of the 24 faults in the
ﬁgure. Carrying forward the discussion from Section 3, we use fl.1
to denote the fault at the i-th location. Then the sample space for
the single fault modeling can be deﬁned as F1 = {f11,f21,f31,...,f214}.
Here the superscript 1 refers to the fact that we are considering
only single faults. Now if fl.1 6F1 occurs, an input vector t detects
the fault iff the output vector Z in the faultless system differs

from the output vector Zfl in the faulty system. Mathematically,
Z(t) 5i£Zfl (t). If we cannot ﬁnd such an input t, we say the fault is
undetectable. In the circuit shown in Figure 7a, the only input vector
that can detect any fl.1 6 F 1 for this particular network is V = 00 001,
which is achieved with EGF = 0, HBEGF = 0, IGF = 0, NRGl = 0
and PTEN = 1. This is due to the fact that for any other binary
input V, all the outputs are equal to 1, regardless of whether a
stuck-at fault is present or not. This result is not at all surprising.
Indeed, when there is no GF outside the cellular membrane and
also the tumor suppressor protein PTEN is active, we expect to see
all the proliferative transcription factors and anti-apoptotic factors
deactivated or turned ‘OFF’. However, if there are faults (mutations)
in the signal transduction pathways, we could see proliferation even
in the absence of active input signals (mitogens).

(b) Equivalent Faults for Input = 00001

Fig. 8. Single fault simulation: (3) output simulation in presence of all single
stuck-at faults for input V: 00001 and (b) equivalent single stuck-at fault
groups for input V = 00001.

V= [EGF,HBEGF,IGF,NRG1,PTEN]. Each input can take
binary values. For this simulation, we take V=00001. The
output vector is Z = [FOS—JUN,SP1,SRF—ELK1,SRF—
ELK4,BCL2,BCL2L1,CCND1]. For the fault-free circuit, we get
the output Z(00001)= 0000000. Now for the 24 different faults
which may induce cancer in the given circuit, the outputs are
tabulated in Figure 8a.

5.4.2 Fault classiﬁcation: From the outputs shown in Figure 8a,
we can classify the faults into different groups of equivalent faults.
Faults which generate the same output vectors for a particular
test input vector are called ‘equivalent faults’ with respect to that
input test vector. The information in Figure 8a leads us to sets of
equivalent faults for the test input vector V = 00 001. The equivalent
fault groups along with their corresponding outputs are shown in
Figure 8b.

From Figure 8b, it is clear that any fault in the locations 13, 14, 15
cannot be detected from the output since the corresponding output is
the same as that for the fault-free case. Hence, this class of faults is
said to be ‘undetectable’. It is true that ‘undetectable faults’ cannot
be compensated for based on observations of the output. Assuming
that the outputs are true indicators of the processes being monitored,
there is no reason why we should be concerned with faults that do
not manifest themselves in the outputs. Hence, this is not a major
concern especially if we are only interested in the behavior of the
outputs.

5.5 Simulation results for drug intervention

Since we have only the six available drugs, we deﬁne a drug
vector of length 6 as follows. If a particular drug is applied it
is assigned the value 1, otherwise it is assigned the value 0.
Consequently, the drug vector space has cardinality 26:64. The
simulation is carried out for all of the possible faults, taken one
at a time, and for each of the 64 different drug vectors, and the
corresponding outputs are computed. The drug vector is deﬁned by
[lapatinib,AG825 ,AG1024, U 0 1 26, LY 294002, Temsirolimus].

5.5.1 Continuous real mapping of the output vector: To avoid
introducing any possible ambiguity about the origin of the
proliferative signaling, we take the same input vector (00 001) that

we have previously used for the fault analysis. In the no fault case,
with the drug vector 000000 we get the output 0000000 which
is certainly non-proliferative. However, in the presence of faults,
the outputs will be different. The objective of this simulation is to
determine the best possible drug sequence which can nullify the
effect of the fault, i.e. produce an output close to 00 00 000 or away
from the proliferative output 11 11 111. We note that although all the
output vectors are represented as binary numbers, assigning the usual
binary weights to the digits here does not make any biological sense.
In other words, 11 11 111 here does not really mean 127 or 00 00 111
does not really mean 7. Consequently, we need to determine some
transformation which will map these 128:27 output vectors to a
continuous real number scale in a biologically meaningful way. One
way to do this is to proceed as follows.

If we examine the components of the output vector, we see that
out of the seven components, four are transcription factors, which
express (turn ON) the important genes leading to proliferation. The
remaining three components capture the activation status of some
key proteins in the cytoplasm. So, these two groups of outputs have
different biological signiﬁcance and should be encoded separately.
A possible mathematical transformation on the output vectors is
described next.

The output vector is

OUTPUT:[FOS—JUN,SP1,SRF—ELK1,SRF—
ELK4,BCL2,BCL2L1,CCND1].

Now suppose we take the number of active transcription factors
as the ﬁrst variable (F) and the number of active remaining outputs
as the second variable (S). The mathematical transformation makes
use of these two variables as described in Equation (1) below:

Output: [a,b,c,d,e,f,g]
F=a+b+c+d
S=e+f+g

P=FXS

S=F+S
1//(Output)=otP+(1 —ot)S,

(1)

where a e (0, 1) is a design parameter. The above encoding scheme
counts the number of active transcription factors and the number of
active key proteins and combines these two counts via a non-linear
many-to-one map, the idea being to quantify the degree of abnormal
behavior, e.g. proliferation in the absence of GFs, etc. With a chosen
as 0.5, the function I/I’s values over the full sweep on the drug
vectors and faults are shown in Figure 9. Here, the fault numbers and
drug vectors are listed along the horizontal and vertical directions,
respectively. The results are color coded for easier visualization, and
the color codes used are tabulated on the right side in Figure 9.

5.5.2 Interpretation of the result: From the output tables and
the color codes, we see that the color green corresponds to non-
proliferation while the color red corresponds to a high chance of
proliferation even in the absence of mitogenic signals. So, the best
drug vector will be the one which can drive the largest number
of faulty circuits toward non-proliferative (green) outputs. For
example, the drug vector 000110 drives all of the faults 1—6 to
green and most of the remaining boxes along that row away from
red. So, the drug combination of U0126 and LY294002 will likely

be effective in producing a non-proliferative output. Another point
to note is that there can be faults (like fault 18 in Fig. 9) whose
output cannot be altered using any drug sequence. This is not at all
surprising and is consistent with the pathway information that we
have. Indeed, the fault location 18 is at the ERK 1/ERK2 protein
and there is no available drug in our list downstream of that protein.
Consequently, no drug in this particular case study would be able to
block the effect of a mutated ERK 1 /ERK 2 protein.

6 CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this article, we have presented a new approach for designing
cancer therapies based on available pathway information and
the manner in which drugs target speciﬁc pathway connections.
Relevant pathway information is ﬁrst used to produce BNs whose
state transitions are consistent with the given pathway information
or minor variations of it. The BN is then realized as a digital circuit
which is used to (i) enumerate all the possible fault scenarios;
(ii) classify the faults into different classes based on their responses
to a particular test input; and (iii) prescribe an appropriate course

Cancer therapy using pathway logic

 

of therapeutic action, tailored to the fault or set of faults that has
occurred. To keep the discussion focused on practical translational
science, the entire presentation has been carried out speciﬁc to the
GF signaling pathways. These pathways are widely studied in the
context of cancer and also have a number of associated drugs known
to target them at different points. Because the entire procedure is
embedded in classical circuit theory, it can be implemented using
slight variations of existing electrical engineering software.

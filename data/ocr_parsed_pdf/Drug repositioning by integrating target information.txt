ABSTRACT

Motivation: The emergence of network medicine not only offers more
opportunities for better and more complete understanding of the mo-
lecular complexities of diseases, but also serves as a promising tool
for identifying new drug targets and establishing new relationships
among diseases that enable drug repositioning. Computational
approaches for drug repositioning by integrating information from mul-
tiple sources and multiple levels have the potential to provide great
insights to the complex relationships among drugs, targets, disease
genes and diseases at a system level.

Results: In this article, we have proposed a computational framework
based on a heterogeneous network model and applied the approach
on drug repositioning by using existing omics data about diseases,
drugs and drug targets. The novelty of the framework lies in the fact
that the strength between a disease—drug pair is calculated through an
iterative algorithm on the heterogeneous graph that also incorporates
drug-target information. Comprehensive experimental results show
that the proposed approach significantly outperforms several recent
approaches. Case studies further illustrate its practical usefulness.

1 INTRODUCTION

Traditionally, drug discovery and drug development mainly rely
on cell-based or target-based screening of chemical compounds
to identify a small subset of ‘hits’, properties of which are then
studied to further increase their afﬁnity, efﬁcacy and selectivity,
before moving forward to animal tests and clinical trials (Paul
et al., 2010). Even with advance in technology and knowledge
about the molecular bases of diseases, the whole process of drug
development is still lengthy, expensive and with high-failure
rates. It is estimated that the cost for developing a new drug is
~$1.8 billion dollars, and the average time is ~13.5 years (Paul
et al., 2010). Drug repositioning, which aims to identify new
indications of existing drugs, offers a promising alternative to
reduce the total time and cost because of existing safety, toler-
ation and efﬁcacy data on known drugs (Ashburn and Thor,
2004). Several successfully repositioned drugs (e.g. sildenaﬁl)

have generated signiﬁcant revenues for their patent holders/
companies.

The generation of large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, prote-
omic data and their integration with signaling and metabolimic
data in a network framework have provided new insights of
molecular basis of complex diseases and have enabled a net-
work-based View of drug discovery and development (Hopkins,
2008). The emergence of network medicine not only offers more
opportunities for better and more complete understanding of
molecular complexities of diseases (Goh and Choi, 2012; Goh
et al., 2007), but also serves as a promising tool for identifying
new drug targets (Campillos et al., 2008; Yildirim et al., 2007)
and establishing new relationships among diseases that enable
drug repositioning (Barabasi et al., 2011). Since these earlier
works, many computational approaches have been proposed
either for target prediction (Bleakley and Yamanishi, 2009;
Campillos et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2012; Emig, 2013; Keiser
et al., 2009; Perlman et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Yamanishi
et al., 2008) or drug repositioning (Chiang and Butte, 2009;
Gottlieb et al., 2011; Lamb et al., 2006; Li et al., 2009; Sirota
et al., 2011), many of which have used network-based
algorithms.

In many of these studies, drug target prediction and drug re-
positioning were treated as two separate tasks. We argue that by
incorporating target information directly into drug repositioning,
we can potentially make more meaningful predictions. The
underlying assumption is based on the principle of rational
drug design: therapeutic effect of chemical compounds on dis-
eases is through their binding to biological targets that are rele-
vant to diseases themselves. Although it is not feasible to fully
adopt the rational drug-design strategy in large-scale systematic
assessment of relationships among all drugs and all diseases, it is
a promising direction to include target information in drug
repositioning. This principle has been recognized by many
researchers (e.g. Gottlieb et al., 2011; Li et al., 2009). What is
lacking is a systematic approach to automatically integrate drug-
target information into drug repositioning.

In this article, we propose a novel heterogeneous network
model that seamlessly integrates drug repositioning and target
prediction into one uniﬁed framework. The full heterogeneous
graph model consists of three different types of nodes: diseases,
drugs and drug targets (Fig. 1). Diseasewlrug relationships and
drugitarget relationships are constructed based on prior know-
ledge from existing databases such as DrugBank (Knox et al.,
2011). Diseasewlisease, drugwlrug and targetitarget relation-
ships are constructed based on their similarities. The drug

repositioning is thus formulated as a missing edge prediction
problem on this heterogeneous graph. An iterative updating al-
gorithm that propagates information across the network is then
developed to solve the missing edge prediction problem. Our
approach is based on the guilt-by-association principle
(Altshuler et al., 2000) that has been validated repeatedly in
many studies, including studies on drug repositioning (Chiang
and Butte, 2009). A unique characteristic of our framework is
that it automatically incorporates drug-target information into
drugwlisease association prediction.

Although the primary goal of this article is to investigate the
drug repositioning problem, it is also worth noting that by using
the newly proposed heterogeneous model and the iterative updat-
ing algorithm, new drugitarget relationships will also be automat-
ically constructed simultaneously. When only diseases and drugs
are considered or only drugs and targets are considered, the triple
layer model is reduced to a two-layer model. The two-layer model
using drugs and targets for target prediction was investigated by
our group in a recent paper, and its iterative updating algorithm
was termed Heterogeneous Graph Based Inference (HGBI)
(Wang et al., 2013). The same algorithm can also be used for
the two-layer model consisting of diseases and drugs for drug
repositioning. However, it cannot be directly extended to the
tree-layer model, which will be the focus of this study.

To evaluate the newly proposed three-layer model (termed
TL_HGBI, for Triple Layer Heterogeneous Graph Based

Inference) for drug repositioning, we will compare its performance
with the performance of the two-layer model consisting of only
diseases and drugs by using the HGBI algorithm originally de-
veloped for drug target prediction (Wang et al., 2013). The evalu-
ation is mainly based on leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)
experiments on large-scale omics data from existing databases [e. g.
DrugBank, OMIM (Hamosh et al., 2005)]. Three additional state-
of—the-art approaches, namely, GBA (Chiang and Butte, 2009),
BLM (Bleakley and Yamanishi, 2009) and NBI (Cheng et al.,
2012) are also included in the comparison. Although BLM and
NBI (HGBI as well) were originally developed for drugitarget
association prediction, the algorithms have been used on drug
disease association prediction (Gottlieb et al., 2011; Perlman
et al., 2011) and can naturally be applied on drug repositioning.
Experimental results show that TL_HGBI performs the best with
highest AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic, i.e.
ROC curve). In particular, when focusing on the top 1% predicted
drugwlisease associations, TL_HGBI successfully retrieves 304
interactions of 1382 true diseasewlrug interactions, whereas
HGBI, BLM and NBI retrieve 290, 15 and 2 such interactions.
Furthermore, in a case study of five different diseases, many of the
top-ranked drugs are strongly supported by recent literature,
knowledge of which was not included in the experiment.

2 METHODS

2.1 A two-layer heterogeneous network model
for drug repositioning

We ﬁrst introduce the two-layer heterogeneous network model for drug
repositioning. The network consists of two types of nodes, i.e. disease
nodes and drug nodes, and three types of edges, i.e. diseasedisease edges,
drugidrug edges and diseasedrug edges. Let D ={d1, d2, ..., dn} denote
the n diseases; R= {r1, r2, ..., rm} denote the m drugs. Let E44 and E,,
denote edges between diseases and drugs, respectively. Let WM and
W,, denote edge weights, which reﬂect disease—disease and drugwlrug
similarities. Let Ed, denote the known disease—drug relationships. The
weights on all these disease—drug edges are initially assigned 1 and
denoted by Wdr. The drug repositioning problem can therefore be for-
mulated as missing edge prediction problem on the heterogeneous graph
GDR={{D, R}, {E44, E,,, Em}, {WM W,,, Wd,}}. The objective is to cap-
ture hidden relationships between drugs and diseases based on drugwlrug
similarities, diseassdisease similarities and known drugitarget inter-
actions. Structure-wise, this model is the same as the two-layer model
we developed for drug target prediction (Wang et al., 2013). Therefore,
we will use the same iterative algorithm HGBI to solve the problem.

2.2 A three-layer heterogeneous network model
for drug repositioning

The three-layer heterogeneous network model consists of three types of
nodes: disease nodes, drug nodes and target nodes. Let D = {d1, d2, ..., dn}
denote the n disease nodes, R= {r1, r2, ..., rm} denote the m drug nodes
and T: {[1, t2, ..., [1} denote the 1 target nodes. The edges among these
nodes are deﬁned based on their relationships. For example, the intracon-
nections between the same types of nodes can be deﬁned based on their
similarities or their relationships from other data sources. For our initial
investigations, we will use similarity measures to deﬁne intraconnections.
Disease similarities can be calculated based on their phenotypic descrip-
tions (Van Driel et al., 2006). Drug similarities can be calculated based on
their chemical structures (Steinbeck et al., 2006). Target similarities can be
calculated based on their protein sequence similarities (Bleakley and

Yamanishi, 2009). Distributions of these similarity measures will be inves-
tigated, and proper thresholds will be selected to construct the network.
Two nodes of the same type will be connected if and only if their simi-
larity measure is greater than the selected threshold, and the similarity is
treated as edge weight. The interconnections between different types of
nodes can be established based on existing knowledge. Initial disease
drug interactions can be obtained from previous studies (Gottlieb et al.,
2011). Initial drugitarget interactions can be collected from the
DrugBank database. The weights of all disease—drug and drugtarget
edges are originally assigned as one. Direct links between diseases and
targets are generally unknown.

Let E44, E", E4, E4, and Er, represent the sets of edges between diseasei
disease, drugwlrug, targetitarget, diseasedrug and drugitarget, respect-
ively, and W44, W", W4, W4, and W,, represent the weight matrices on
these edges. The heterogeneous diseasedrugitarget graph can be repre-
sented as GDRT:  R, 7}, {Eddy Ett, Err, Edr, En}, {Wdtb Wm Wit,
W4,, W,,}}. Our goal of drug repositioningbased on this graphisto establish
new edges between drugs and diseases and to assess their reliability.
Essentially, the original heterogeneous graph GDRT is considered as an in-
complete graph with missing edges between disease nodes and drug nodes.
The objective is to capture those interactions based on diseasedisease,
drugdrug and targetitarget similarities, as well as known disease—drug,
drugtarget interactions.

2.3 An iterative updating algorithm

Based on the guilt-by-association principle (e.g. Barabasi et al., 2011;
Chiang and Butte, 2009), new diseasedrug relationships can be inferred
through existing relationships between similar diseases and similar drugs.
Likewise, novel drugitarget relationship can be inferred through existing
relationships between similar drugs and similar targets (Wang et al.,
2013). Therefore, we infer new disease—drug relationships in the newly
proposed three-layer model by using an information ﬂow-based method.
Intuitively, to establish the relationship between a drug r and a disease d
that have no connections originally, one can calculate a new weight

w(d, r) = Z Z w(d, 01,-) x w(d,, r,) x w(r, r,) (1)

dieD r/ER

where there is a direct link between disease d, and drug rj, and w(d, di) and
w(r, rj) represent disease—disease and drugwlrug similarities. This serves as
a baseline method for a two-layer mode. We further improve this simple
model in four aspects. First, based on the principle of rational drug
design, we incorporate target information into our model. Second, new
links between diseases and targets will be established and updated. Third,
once a new weight is estimated, it can also be used to update other
weights. Therefore, an iterative updating algorithm is proposed. Fourth,
during the process, the initial links need to be treated differently from
newly established links because the initial links represent existing
knowledge, whereas the newly established links represent predictions.To
incorporate target information, we ﬁrst propose an association coefﬁ-
cient/weight between a disease d and a target t as follows:

w(d, t) = Z Z w(d, r,-) x w(r,, r,) x w(r,, t) (2)

he]? me]?

which incorporates all drugs connected to d and t, as well as their simila-
rities. Once the relationships between diseases and targets are established,
new weights between diseases and drugs can be deﬁned by considering
these relationships:

w(d, r) = Z Z w(d, t,-) x w(r,, 5-) x w(tj, r) (3)

t,-ET t/ET

The deﬁnition in Equation 3 is potentially more powerful in capturing
drugdisease relationship than the one in Equation 1 because of the con-
sideration of targets. As a by-product from the model, we can also obtain a
new weight between each drug and target pair by incorporating disease

information, which can be used to predict novel target for existing drugs:

w(r, t)= Z Z w(r, 01,-) x w(d,, d,-) x w(d,-, t) (4)

11,-ED d/‘ED
Equations 241 can be rewritten in a matrix format,

ngw = Wdr X Wrr X Wu; (5)
W?” = W4, x W" x W5; W?!” = W; x W44 x W4,
The superscript T represents the transpose of the corresponding matrix.
We treat W4, as a temporary value and replace it in the right sides of the last
two equations using the right hand side of the ﬁrst equation in S, which
results in Equations 6 and 7, respectively.

W3?”= W4. x W.. x W" x W" x W,T,= W4, x (W.. x W" x W" x W5)
(6)

Wff‘” = W; x W44 x W4, x W,, x W,, (7)
=(W4, X W44 X Wm X W") X Wu
Once the new weights (W4, and W”) are obtained, they can be fed into the
right hand side of Equations 6 and 7, so we will have an iterative updating
procedure. Finally, to treat the initial links between diseases and drugs and
initial links between drugs and targets differently from those predicted
ones, our ﬁnal model can be written as:

st1=aW3 x (W,, x Wf, x W" x Wf,T)+(1—a)Wg, (8)

Wf,+1=a(W§,T x W44 x W), x W,,) x ,,+(1—a)W9, (9)

Here 1 — or is a decay factor in the range of((P1). W3, and W9, represent the
initial diseasedrug and drugitarget interactions, respectively. These two
equations can be solved in an iterative propagation-based manner, after
proper normalization, which is summarized as a theorem.

THEOREM. W1}, and W’,‘, deﬁned in Equations 8 and 9 will converge after
proper normalization (the proof can be found in the Appendix).

Although conceptual, the three-layer model is a straightforward ex-
tension of our previous two-layer model (Wang et al., 2013); to ensure
convergence, the iterative algorithm proposed here is different from the
one for two-layer model. For example, the iterative algorithm above can
only predict new interactions between diseases and drugs with known inter-
actions, whereas the original iterative algorithm for the two-layer model
can also predict new interactions for disease—drug pairs without known
interactions (Wang et al., 2013). To predict interactions between disease
drug pairs with no known interactions, we take a two-step approach: ﬁrst,
apply the algorithm proposed here, and then apply the algorithm in (Wang
et al., 2013) on the newly obtained graph but only consisting of diseases and
drugs, and their interactions with new weights (Fig. 1B, right panel).

2.4 Datasets

To construct the network, we ﬁrst downloaded drug, target and disease
information from different data sources. All pairwise disease—disease,
drugwlrug and targetitarget similarities were then calculated. Nodes of
the same types were connected if their similarities are greater than a
threshold, which was determined using cross-validation. Known dis-
easedrug and the drugitarget interactions were obtained from existing
databases. The methods in calculating these similarities and connections
are outlined here.

2.4.] Drugidrug similarities We ﬁrst obtained all the approved
drugs from the DrugBank database (Knox et al., 2011). Drugidrug simi-
larities were calculated based on their chemical structures. First, chemical
structures of all drug compounds in the Canonical Simpliﬁed Molecular-
Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) format (Weininger, 1988) were

downloaded from DrugBank. Then, the Chemical Development Kit
(Steinbeck et al., 2006) was used to calculate a binary ﬁngerprint for
each drug. Finally, Tanimoto score (Tanimoto, 1957) of two drugs was
calculated based on their fingerprints, which is in the range of [0, 1].

2.4.2 Targetitarget similarities Our target database not only
includes known drug targets, but also includes potential targets, i.e. pro-
teins encoded by druggable genes. A druggable gene is deﬁned
as a human protein coding gene that contributes to a disease
phenotype and can be modiﬁed by a small molecule drug. The term
‘druggable genome’ has been used to denote a list of computationally
predicted genes that their proteins can serve as suitable targets for de-
veloping therapeutic drugs. The list of druggable genes/targets was down-
loaded from the Sophic Integrated Druggable Genome Database
(http://www.sophicalliance.com/). The targetitarget similarities were cal-
culated using the Smith7Waterman algorithm (Smith and Waterman,
1981) based on the amino acid sequences of their corresponding proteins.
The similarities were normalized using the same method proposed in
(Bleakley and Yamanishi, 2009).

2.4.3 Diseaswdisease similarities A phenotype based disease
disease similarity dataset was downloaded from MimMiner (Van Driel
et al., 2006), which was constructed by calculating similarities based on
the numbers of occurrences of MeSH (medical subject headings vocabu-
lary) terms in the medical descriptions of each pair of diseases from the
OMIM database (Hamosh et al., 2005). According to the MimMiner
database description, the similarities have already been normalized to
the range [0, 1].

2.4.4 Drug target interactions Initial drugitarget interactions were
collected from the DrugBank database, but limited to drugs that have
associated diseases in OMIM database (Hamosh et al., 2005), which are
the same as the one used in Gottlieb et al. (2011). The corresponding
value in the matrix W13, was set to 1 if an interaction exists and 0
otherwise.

2.4.5 Diseaswdrug interactions Initial disease—drug interactions
were obtained from Gottlieb et al. (2011), where disease and drug inter-
actions were assembled for diseases listed in the OMIM database
(Hamosh et al., 2005) and their associated drugs [but limit to the ones
registered in the DrugBank database (Knox et al., 2011)]. The corres-
ponding value in the matrix W3, was set to 1 if an interaction exists and 0
otherwise.

2.5 Experimental design

To systematically evaluate the proposed approach on the collected data-
sets, we adopt a LOOCV strategy for the experiments. Basically, for each
disease, at each iteration, one of its diseaerug connections is treated as
the test data and all the remaining observations as the training data. After
we perform the algorithm on the training data, the tested drug is ranked
together with all other drugs in descending order according to their ﬁnal
connection weights to the disease. For each speciﬁc ranking threshold, if
the rank of the testing connection is above the threshold, it is regarded as
a true positive. The number of times that a true positive is discovered over
all possible disease—drug relationships is regarded as the true-positive rate
corresponding to the speciﬁed threshold. On the other hand, if the rank of
an unknown connection is above the threshold, it is regarded as a false
positive. True-positive rate and false-positive rate are calculated with
varying ranking thresholds to construct the ROC curve. AUC represents
the overall performance of the algorithm. In addition, we also examine
the performance of the algorithm on the top-ranked results, i.e. the num-
bers of correctly retrieved testing connections based on various top per-
centiles (the most left side of the ROC curve), because the top-ranked
results are more important in practice. Finally, to test the capacity of the
algorithm in detecting novel interactions for diseases with no known

drugs, we collect all diseases that only have a single known drug and
perform the experiment by removing the only interaction.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Preliminary analysis of datasets

The dataset consists of 5080 diseases, 1409 drugs and 3989 tar-
gets. Majority of similarity values among the same type of nodes
are small (Supplementary Appendix Fig. A1 in Appendix). Based
on previous studies (Chen et al., 2011a; Van Driel et al., 2006;
Vanunu et al., 2010), low-level similarity values provide little
information or even adversely affect prediction performance
for interaction inference. We chose the same similarity threshold
(0.3) as the one in Vanunu et al. (2010), which used the same
disease set in their study. We chose the value of the decay factor
a to be 0.4, so the initial connections have slightly more weights.
After we obtained the main results, we performed a sensitivity
study using a 10-fold cross-validation on different combinations
of similarity thresholds and the decay factor. The results
(Supplementary Appendix Table A1 in Appendix) show that
for a ﬁxed decay factor, a similarity score of 0.4 gives the best
results for TL_HGBI. For a ﬁxed similarity score of 0.3, the
model is very robust, and the performance does not change
much for the decay factor from 0.1417, though smaller values
(more weight on original data) have slightly better performance.

The interconnections between different types of nodes are
sparse. There are only 1461 connections between 233 diseases
and 549 drugs, and 2098 connections between 554 drugs and
602 targets. Furthermore, among the nodes with connections,
many of them have more than one connection (Supplementary
Appendix Fig. A2 in Appendix), which indicates that known
information about diseases, drugs and targets is highly concen-
trated on a small subset of all diseases/drugs/targets.

3.2 Validation of guilt-by-association assumption

To validate the basic assumption that similar drugs tend to be
associated with similar diseases on the collected datasets, simila-
rities of drugs from the same diseases and similarities of drugs
from different diseases were compared. The overall average simi-
larity score of drug pairs from the same diseases, calculated by
averaging the similarities of all drug pairs that belong to the same
diseases for all diseases, is 0.177. In contrast, the average simi-
larity score of drug pairs from different diseases is 0.143. Further
test using Wilcoxon rank-sum indicates that the difference is
statistically signiﬁcant (P<1E-159). Likewise, the average simi-
larity score of disease pairs from the same drugs is 0.157, whereas
the average similarity score of disease pairs from different drugs
is only 0.103, which is signiﬁcantly different (W ilcoxon rank-sum
test, P<1E—53). In addition, similar results exist in drugitarget
relationships. The average similarity score of drug pairs from the
same targets and the average similarity score of target pairs from
the same drugs are 0.251 and 0.106, respectively. In contrast, the
average similarity of drug pairs from different targets and the
average similarity of target pairs from different drugs are 0.143
and 0.022, respectively. The differences are also signiﬁcant based
on Wilcoxon rank-sum test (both P—Values are smaller than
1E-250). Based on these results (more details can be found in
Supplementary Appendix Fig. A3 in Appendix), the dataset

Drug repositioning by integrating target information

 

shows that drugs for the same diseases and drugs targeting the
same proteins are more likely to be similar. The guilt-by-associ-
ation principle can be used in this study.

3.3 Comparison with existing methods on disease with
known drugs

To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we com-
pared it with three popular approaches: GBA (Chiang and Butte,
2009), BLM (Bleakley and Yamanishi, 2009) and NBI (Cheng
et al., 2012), as well as HGBI (Wang et al., 2013). GBA (Chiang
and Butte, 2009) is a simple application of the guilt-by-associ-
ation principle where drugs for one disease is used for another
disease if the two diseases sharing some common drugs. BLM
(Bleakley and Yamanishi, 2009) uses a supervised learning ap-
proach [i.e. support vector machine (SVM)] on a bipartite graph
model. We used the scores generated by SVM as the ranking
criterion. The number of negative samples for SVM training
was chosen based on cross-validation results (Supplementary
Appendix Fig. A4). The ﬁnal result of BLM was obtained by
averaging results from five runs, with the same conﬁguration but
different negative training samples. NBI (Cheng et al., 2012) is a
network-based inference approach based on a two-step diffusion
model on a bipartite graph.

The LOOCV experiment for diseasewlrug association predic-
tion was conducted on all diseases, which has at least two known
drugs. In total, there are 154 such diseases and 1382 initial dis-
easeidrug interactions. The ROC curves and AUC values are
given in Figure 2A. It shows that TL_HGBI (AUC: 0.915)
outperforms all other methods signiﬁcantly. HGBI (AUC:
0.837) and BLM (AUC: 0.830) perform similarly, while NBI
has the worst performance (AUC: 0.580), indicating that a
two-step diffusion is not sufﬁcient to accurately predict dis-
easeidrug associations. Because GBA does not rank its
prediction, a full ROC curve could not be constructed. Instead,
the true-positive rate of GBA is 0.739, with a false positive rate of
0.158 (the point in the ﬁgure, which is below the ROC curve of
TL_HGBI). The numbers of correctly retrieved diseasewlrug
interactions according to different percentiles are given in
Figure 2B. For a speciﬁed percentile, a true diseaseidrug inter-
action is considered as correctly retrieved if the predicted ranking
of this interaction is higher than the specified percentile. Clearly,

1382 true interactions for different percentiles by different approaches

TL_HGBI performs the best among all approaches. More im-
portantly, when focusing on the top-ranked results, TL_HGBI
(as well as HGBI) signiﬁcantly outperformed NBI and BLM.
For example, among the 1382 true diseasewlrug interactions,
304/290 of them are among the top 1% ranked predictions
based on TL_HGBI/HGBI. However, only 15 and 2 are
among the top 1% predictions for BLM and NBI, respectively.
The top-ranked predictions are particularly important because
they contain smaller number of false positives. Therefore,
TL_HGBI can be more useful in practice than other approaches.

The differences between TL_HGBI and HGBI illustrate that
including target information can indeed improve diseasewlrug
association predictions. To systematically evaluate the advantage
of using target information in drug repositioning, we further
performed more experiments by randomly removing 15%,
30% and 60% of known drugitarget links in the graph.
Results show that AUC values gradually decrease when more
links are removed (Supplementary Appendix Fig. A5), which
demonstrates the contribution of target information in drug
repositioning.

3.4 Evaluation on diseases with no known drugs

To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in pre-
dicting drugs for diseases with no known drugs, all diseases that
have exactly one associated drug in the dataset were collected.
There are 79 such diseases in total. The single interaction was
removed in this experiment to test capacity of each algorithm to
recover it. Because GBA and BLM cannot predict novel drugs
for diseases with no known drugs, we only compared NBI,
HGBI and TL_HGBI. The ROC curves and AUC values are
given in Figure 3A. Once again, TL_HGBI (AUC: 0.789) and
HGBI (AUC: 0.784) performed signiﬁcantly better than NBI
(AUC: 0.606). In this case, TL_HGBI and HGBI performed
similarly, and both of them were not as good as their own results
using diseases with known drugs. Nevertheless, the steep curves
on the left side of Figure 3A still show their good performance
for top-ranked predictions.

3.5 Case studies

In addition to the leave-one-out cross-validation experiments, we
also applied TL_HGBI on all the collected data to make novel
drug usage predictions. Results for all diseases will be made
available on our Web site once the article gets published. We
present results of ﬁve selected diseases here, which include
Huntington disease (HD, OMIM 143100), Nonismall-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC, OMIM 211980), Alcohol dependence (AD,
OMIM 103780), Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC, OMIM
182280) and Polysubstance abuse, Susceptibility to (PSAB,
OMIM 606581). For each disease, all the drugs that are
known for the disease and the top 10 ranked predictions can
be found in Table 1. The diseases, drugs and their connections
are also shown in Figure 3B (only showing the top three pre-
dicted drugs of each disease for clarity). Even this small set of
examples shows some interesting observations. First, similar dis-
eases such as NSCLC and SCLC do share some common pre-
dictions, although these drugs were not known for any of the
diseases. Second, TL_HGBI predicted some novel usage of drugs
for diseases with no known drugs (e. g. PSAB). In this case, as the

disease is only connected to disease alcohol dependence (node
ALCOHOLISM in Fig. 3B), it is not surprising that its top-
ranked predictions are from drugs for alcohol dependence.

We further searched the literature and found that some top-
ranked drugs are supported by recently published papers, know-
ledge of which was not found in the databases used in this study.
For HD, all top ﬁveranked drugs have already been studied for
this disease (Alpay and Koroshetz, 2006; Bonelli et al., 2003;
Duff et al., 2008; Paleacu et al., 2002; Van Vugt et al., 1997).
The top three predicted drugs for NSCLC have also been studied
for the disease (Ardizzoni et al., 2007; Dziadziuszko et al., 2003).
For AD, the drug Lorazepam (DB00186) has already been tested

in clinical trial (Clinicaltrials.Gov, 2012a). For SCLC, it was also
found that Carboplatin (DB00958) and Temozolomide
(DB00853) had already been tested in clinical trials for curing
this disease (Clinicaltrials.Gov, 2012b, 20120). All these results
have shown that the proposed approach can potentially be very
effective in predicting novel drugs for diseases.

To assess the effectiveness of incorporating target information
in these case studies, for the above top candidates with reference
support, we compared their ranks by TL_HGBI and by HGBI
(Supplementary Appendix Table A2). Results show that for
NSCLC and SCLC, the ranks of these candidates by
TL_HGBI and HGBI have little differences. This is not

Drug repositioning by integrating target information

 

surprising because most of these cancer drugs are non-target-
speciﬁc and the results were mostly based on disease similarities
for both TL_HGBI and HGBI. In contrast, for AD, Lorazepam
is ranked number 1 by TL_HGBI, but only ranked 1051 by
HGBI. Investigation shows that Lorazepam has 20 targets, ma-
jority of which are gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A recep-
tor subunits. GABA A receptors occur in central nervous system
and play a role in many brain functions. TL_HGBI was able to
identify Lorazepam as the top candidate by using target infor-
mation. For HD, we have also observed improvements in rank-
ing when including target information.

3.6 Drug—target association predictions

As we mentioned earlier, as a by-product, TL_HGBI also reports
novel drugitarget associations. Comparing with HGBI,
TL_HGBI uses disease information in predicting novel drug tar-
gets. We therefore compared the performance of TL_HGBI with
HGBI for drug target predictions for drugs with and without
known targets (Supplementary Appendix Figs A6 and A7 in
Appendix). Results show that TL_HGBI performs a little
better than HGBI, but the difference is really subtle [AUC:
0.936 (TL_HGBI) versus 0.932 (HGBI) for diseases with
known drugs; 0.953 (TL_HGBI) vs. 0.931 (HGBI) for diseases
without known drugs]. This result indicates disease similarities
contribute little to drugitarget association predictions.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we have proposed a three-layer heterogeneous
graph model that captures inter- and intrarelationships among
diseases, drugs and targets, with the purpose of novel drug usage
prediction. Based on this framework, we have developed an it-
erative algorithm to obtain ﬁnal proximity scores between dis-
eases and drugs, which can be used to rank candidate drugs for
each disease. Experimental results on diseases with and without
known drugs have shown that TL_HGBI outperforms other
three popular methods, as well as the two-layer model proposed
earlier by our group. In particular, TL_HGBI is more useful in
practice than other approaches tested here because of its top-
ranked drugs consisting of many true drugidisease relationships.
A case study on ﬁve diseases using all existing data indicates that
results obtained by TL_HGBI can be of high importance, sup-
ported by existing literature.

One should notice that there exist many other types of data
(e.g. side effect information of drugs, gene expression data) that
can also be used to predict drugwlisease/drugitarget associations
(e.g. Yang and Agarwal, 2011). Some existing methods (e.g.
PREDICT by Gottlieb et al., 2011) have used different datasets
in predicting diseasewlrug associations, which makes it imprac-
tical to directly compare their performance with the performance
of the proposed approach. In addition to datasets, there are dif-
ferent ways in deﬁning relationships among nodes of the same
type. For example, connections between targets can be defined
based on proteiniprotein interaction data or based on protein
structural information (e. g. focusing on binding domains).
Disease relationships can be deﬁned based on ontology. The
relative merits using different metrics are worth further investi-
gations. Nevertheless, valuable information has been lost for

approaches not considering relationships among nodes of the
same type (Li and Lu, 2013).

We plan to address both issues in our future work by extend-
ing the proposed framework in several possible directions. To
include more diverse datasets of different types (other than the
three discussed here), one direct extension is to add more layers
(and more links) to the system. The key is then how to generalize
the iterative updating algorithm to the new multi—layer model. In
the case where additional datasets can actually be treated as
properties of one of the three entities, another possible extension
is to represent drugs/diseases/proteins using feature vectors, the
elements of which will be deﬁned based on those additional
datasets. For example, to incorporate drug side effect informa-
tion, each drug will be presented by a feature vector, which may
include drug compound structure, drug side effect information
and some other properties. For each drug pair, one score is
calculated for each feature. Scores of all features will be con-
verted into percentile-based scores in a similar way as we did
in an earlier study for gene prioritization based on multiple
data sources (Chen et al., 2011b). Drugwlrug relationships can
then be deﬁned based on the most significant score. Similarly,
gene expression information and protein interaction information
can be incorporated into the protein/target layer. Essentially, the
relationships between the same types of nodes are redeﬁned
based on more data sources. Another possible direction is to
incorporate semantics (Chen et al., 2012).

Finally, both diseases and targets can be separated into differ-
ent subclasses based on their mechanisms. It will be interesting to
see how the performance will change when we only include sub-
sets of data with the same mechanism. Eventually, wet lab ex-
perimental testing is a necessary step to validate the proposed
approach, which cannot be done without collaborations with
investigators with expertise in biochemistry and drug
development.

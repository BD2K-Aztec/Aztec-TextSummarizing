ABSTRACT

Motivation: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods have the
potential for changing the landscape of biomedical science, but at
the same time pose several problems in analysis and interpretation.
Currently, there are many commercial and public software packages
that analyze NGS data. However, the limitations of these applications
include output which is insufficiently annotated and of difficult
functional comprehension to end users.

Results: We developed GAMES (Genomic Analysis of Mutations
Extracted by Sequencing), a pipeline aiming to serve as an efficient
middleman between data deluge and investigators. GAMES attains
multiple levels of filtering and annotation, such as aligning the
reads to a reference genome, performing quality control and
mutational analysis, integrating results with genome annotations and
sorting each mismatch/deletion according to a range of parameters.
Variations are matched to known polymorphisms. The prediction
of functional mutations is achieved by using different approaches.
Overall GAMES enables an effective complexity reduction in large-
scale DNA-sequencing projects.

Availability: GAMES is available free of charge to academic users
and may be obtained from http://aqua.unife.it/GAMES.

1 INTRODUCTION

Next-generation sequencing (NGS), or deep sequencing, methods
are rapidly Changing the standards in genomics (Metzker, 2010).
Consolidated instruments, such as Illumina Genome Analyzer
(Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and ABI SOLiD (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) can sequence a ﬁill human
genome in previously unimagined speed. To date, NGS has been
applied in various contexts, including whole-genome sequencing
(Bentley, 2006), discovery of transcription factor binding sites,
and non-coding RNA expression proﬁles (Kato, 2009; Mardis,
2008). Massively parallel DNA-sequencing technologies, combined
with sequence-capture methodologies (targeted re-sequencing)
have obvious potential in Clinical diagnostics, particularly for

complex disorders that may be caused by a combination of
several genes. A major goal of these studies is the detection of
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions
(InDels), and other rearrangements to identify disease-associated
variants in Clinical samples. These genetic determinants contribute
to variation in phenotypes, risk to diseases, and response
to drugs or to the environment. Different studies, such as
1000 Genomes Project (Kaiser, 2008) and the Cancer Genome
Atlas (http://Cancergenome.nih.gov/), have implemented massive
sequencing to more efﬁciently catalog genetic mutations responsible
for cancer and other diseases. Therefore, NGS provides important
knowledge about genetic variants in the population and about those
genetic variants that are being commonly used in diagnostic studies
in Clinical settings. On one hand, NGS provides unprecedented
opportunities for high-throughput genetic research; alternatively,
it poses problems in rationale data analysis and requires adequate
computational strategies to organize, handle and interpret the results
(Shendure and Ji, 2008).

In the past few years, tools for the analysis of short/long reads
datasets have become available. Currently, the scientiﬁc community
has access to many commercial and open source software packages
for analyzing NGS data. CLC Genomics Workbench software
(CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark) and NextGENe (SoftGenetics, State
College, PA) are among the most popular in the commercial domain.
Furthermore, there are open source packages, such as MAQ (Li et al.,
2008), SHRIMP (Rumble et al., 2009), PASS (Campagna et al.,
2009), BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009), SAMTOOLS (Li et al., 2009),
BFAST (Homer et al., 2009), PerM (Chen et al., 2009), SNVMix
(Goya et (11., 2010 ; Shah et al., 2009), Crossbow (Langmead et al.,
2009) and Atlas-SNP2 (Shen et al., 2010).

For 1000 Genome Project pilot data bioinformatic analysis,
researchers used Mosaik (http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/marthlab/
Mosaik), MAQ, Coronalite (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA), and SSAHA2 (Ning et al., 2001) as aligners, and used
Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) genotyper (McKenna et al.,
2010), PolyScan (Chen et al., 2007) and PolyBayes (Marth et al.,
1999) for SNP detection.

These tools process data from various platforms using different
algorithms (such as Bayesian approaches) and SNP detection
procedures. However, their output often seems to be insufﬁciently
annotated (to the detriment of Clinical implications) and/or of
difﬁcult ﬁinctional interpretation. To solve this problem, we

developed a pipeline for high-level elucidation of NGS results.
In this article, we introduce GAMES (Genomic Analysis of
Mutations Extracted by Sequencing), a new tool for mining
ﬁinctional mutations. The main purpose of GAMES is to supply life
science investigators with a detailed biological insight into genetic
events. GAMES provides maximum ﬂexibility and allows high-
throughput analysis of data from different NGS platforms. GAMES
generates documents for logical viewing and seamless inspection
of alignments and mismatches. Ultimately, GAMES provides an
easy-to-use framework for processing NGS data. It enables users to
leverage the throughput and accuracy of analysis, while facilitating
its translation into biomedical meaningful results.

2 METHODS

GAMES is written in PERL 5.8 using BioPerl (Stajich et al., 2002). The
workﬂow in GAMES is composed of two sequential steps (Fig. 1). The ﬁrst
step generates per-position information in the pileup format; the second step
processes. evaluates and annotates the identiﬁed genetic events.

2.1 Input ﬁles

The input of GAMES is the alignment in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map)
format (Li et al.. 2009). This format supports short and long reads and is
compatible with different sequencing platforms. Several aligning packages,
such as BWA. MAQ. BFAST and PerM can generate SAM alignments. To
optimize performance, we used Binary Alignment/Map (BAM) format, the
binary representation of SAM. The input. sorted by genomic coordinates, is
processed by removing duplicate reads, in order to minimize artifacts and
false positives. The ﬁnal position-sorted BAM ﬁle is indexed (to create a bai
ﬁle. a standard part in the SAM speciﬁcation) and used as input to GAMES.

2.2 SNP/SNV/InDel calling and Pileup

To begin the analysis. GAMES requires a reference genome sequence in
fasta format and the coordinate-sorted BAM ﬁle.

GAMES analyzes the alignment and, for each mismatch. performs
SNP/SNV/InDel calling and extracts the position and the respective base in
the reference sequence. During this step, GAMES displays the alignment
in pileup format. Each output line consists of chromosome, position,
reference base, consensus base (the ﬁrst best call), Phred-like consensus
quality. number of hits of reads covering the position, the second best
call and the respective quality score and counts. The last two columns
are relative to total counts and repetitivity. There are several parameters
that the user can set for particular purposes and each conﬁguration can
alter speed and behavior of the script. The user sets mapping quality.
reads” length (according to the experiment), minimal quality threshold,
minimum coverage, minor allele frequency and maximal repetitivity. The
parameters used to deﬁne the goodness of mutation detection are the
mapping quality. a measure of the conﬁdence that a read is correctly
aligned (Li et al.. 2008) and the Phred’s base-speciﬁc quality score (Ewing
and Green. 1998; Ewing et al.. 1998). This score is logarithmically
linked to error probabilities. The default minimum quality score is 20,
corresponding to 99% of base-call accuracy. In the calculation of quality
parameter. GAMES accounts for the minimum consensus quality in the three
ﬂanking nucleotides on each side of the mismatch. Considering the quality
values in the neighboring bases improves the reliability at polymorphism
detection (Altshuler et al.. 2000). The minimum coverage is an integer
calculated at each genomic position and indicates the minimum number
of alignments covering the position. The minor allele frequency is the
lowest frequency that can be tolerated in a heterozygote. Finally, in an
optional procedure, GAMES blats each DNA segment (of read length)
containing a bona ﬁde genetic event to the reference genome (Kent,

Fig. 1. The basic workﬂow of GAMES. Starting from alignment in

2.3 Annotation

GAMES has been developed primarily for both a comprehensible in-depth
investigation and an accurate statistical selection of genetic variants. Building
on data acquired from the pileup. GAMES extracts information about each
mismatch and provides genome annotation by integration with genomic
databases. GAMES uses UCSC Genome Browser (Kent at al.. 2002), which
provides a MySQL database annotation data. GAMES queries various tables
in the UCSC database to extract the information for the reference genome
(Table 1). From the knownGene table. we obtain the information relative
to the genomic location of the nucleotide, the gene, the chromosome, the
exon count (for all available isoforms), the strand and the encoded protein/s.
We use this information to determine the position of the mismatch in
the gene and whether it is in a coding/non-coding, exon. intron. UTR or
intron/exon junction region (intronic regions contiguous to exon starts and
exon ends that are important to evaluate splice-site mutations). To ﬁnd

a correspondence in databases of known SNPs: dbSNP (Smigielski et al..
2000) and HapMap (Frazer et al.. 2003). In the current release of GAMES.
we uses snp130 (build 130) and hapmapSnpsCeu tables. The snp130 table
contains almost 19 million SNP annotations, and includes the ﬁrst set of SNP
calls from the 1000 Genomes Project. The hapmapSnpsCeu table consists
of a set of approximately four million common SNPs, and the genotyping
of these SNPs in different human populations. The tables are structured to
include the position of the SNP on the genome assembly as well as additional
informations, such as sequences of the observed alleles from rs-fasta ﬁles.
genotype counts and allele frequencies, kind of mutation and the pathogenetic
signiﬁcance of the SNPs, if reported. GAMES queries the correspondence
between the known SNP in dbSNP and the event identiﬁed by the pileup
analysis. If any correspondence exists. GAMES marks this event as ‘known
SNP”. otherwise, it lists it as ‘unknown SNP”. If the genomic location is not
reported in dbSNP. it is indicated as ‘unreported’. From HapMap database.
GAMES extracts the allele frequencies reported in the population.

GAMES also annotates genetic events with the measurement of
evolutionary conservation using the PhyloP score for 44 vertebrates (Siepel
et al.. 2005, 2006). In the PhyloP table. sites predicted to be conserved
are assigned positive scores, while sites predicted to be fast evolving are
assigned negative scores. Functional mutations are expected to be associated
with conserved sites, while polymorphisms are expected to be associated
with variable locations. Additional information that GAMES extracts from
databases relates to the pathways in which the gene is involved. From
keggPathway and keggMapDesc tables, GAMES annotates what is the
metabolic or pathologic pathway for each gene through the interface with
KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Kanehisa et al.. 2006, 2010). This type
of information is critical for the proper analysis of whole-exome sequencing
projects. in which mutations in different genes might be biologically involved
in the same pathway or disease. GAMES incorporates information about the
distribution of reads in the forward and reverse strands. This information is
necessary because the cross-correlation between the forward and reverse tag
counts can have signiﬁcant effects on the accuracy of the mutation detection
(Bansal, 2010). An unbalanced distribution of reads between forward and
reverse strands may be indicative of sequencing artifacts and, consequently,
may lead to false discoveries. This parameter can then be used to further
ﬁlter bona ﬁde genetic events.

2.4 Output ﬁles

All results generated by GAMES are deposited in text and html ﬁles. These
ﬁles are distributed by a private web server, where they are cataloged
according to the respective NGS project. A text ﬁle lists all the genetic
events detected and their relative annotations. This ﬁle is in tab-delimited
columns format. Starting on the left side of the page. the columns report

genomic information, such as the gene symbol, RefGene ID and UCSC
Gene ID (GAMES takes into account all known isoforms in each gene), the
UniprotKB ID for the associated protein/s. the exon count. the chromosome
and the coordinates, the strand of the gene and the coding sequence limits.
GAMES differentiates coding or non-coding regions. exons. introns or
intron/exon junctions. The columns, following toward right. report the ﬁrst
base call and the second base call with the respective quality score. count
and frequency. If needed. GAMES calculates the effect of the mutation
in the primary sequence of the protein. The links to dbSNP and HapMap
report known SNPs and the eventual clinical relevance. In the last group
of columns, GAMES lists the repetitivity of the local sequence (if the
BLAT option is enabled). the nucleotide conservation in vertebrates and
the pathway in which the gene is involved (with the KEGG ID). The
most useful and convenient results are displayed as interactive tables. in
an html ﬁle. that enlists only those mutations covering the coding regions
and the intron/exon junctions. In this table. the items are directly linked to
main databases: UCSC Genome Browser. Entrez Gene (NCBI). UniprotKB,
dbSNP (NCBI), HapMap (NCBI), Variation Viewer (NCBI) for clinically
associated SNPs. The genetic events are sorted according to the different
parameters chosen by the investigator. The prediction of the structural
effect of a mutation is very important to have a clinical outline of the
disease. To allow this analysis at protein level. GAMES lists all missense
mutations in coding region. not reported in dbSNP or HapMap databases,
in two different text ﬁles that can be directly used by POLYPHEN-2
(Adzhubei et al.. 2010) and SIFT (Kumar et al.. 2009). These tools predict
whether an amino acid substitution affects protein function. respectively, by
a probabilistic classiﬁer based on machine-learning method and by sequence
homology and the physical properties of amino acids. Additionally. GAMES
generates a BED and a MAP track for each sample, Viewable on graphical
interfaces. They can be Visualized with Broad’s Integrative Genomics Viewer
(IGV) (http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv). EnsEMBL or UCSC Genome
Browser. The BED (Browser Extensible Display) ﬁle contains four ﬁelds:
the chromosome, the starting and the ending position of the feature in the
chromosome, the coverage of the site in the reads. The MAF (Multiple
Alignment Format) ﬁle stores the multiple alignment between the reads and
the genome, underlying the mismatches in the sequence. A composite MAF
ﬁle can include the alignment between the reference genome and different
samples to allow comparative genomes variation parsing. Finally, an index is
generated in the web site folder that summarizes and links to all the different
reports for that sample.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Initially, we validated GAMES by using reads obtained with
Genome Analyzer (Illumina) after SureSeleCt Target Enrichment
of 36 genes involved in hereditary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(Wheeler et (11., 2009). The selected regions included 1.9 Mb of
DNA from different human Chromosomes (NCBI build 36). We
sequenced eight samples from patients with hereditary hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.

We used BWA (Burrows—Wheeler Alignment) to align 35 bp
single-end reads to the human genome. BWA builds assemblies by
mapping short reads to reference sequences performing a heuristic
Smith—Waterman-like alignment. The SAM ﬁle of the alignment
was converted to BAM ﬁle using SAMTOOLS. Preprocessing
of the Illumina-sequences dataset was performed to remove PCR
duplicates and trim those sequences that contained bases with low
quality scores (threshold=20) .

GAMES processed the alignment to detect about 2200
mismatches between the human genome reference and each sample,
with minimum quality score of 20 (corresponding to an accuracy of
99%) and minimum read depth of 10. The minor allele frequency was

set to 25% (less common variant at a biallelic SNP). The observed
mismatch detection frequency in these eight samples was thus on
average of 1.1 mismatches/kilobase (2200 mismatches/ 1900 kb).
These results were in excellent agreement with the SNP density
reported by the HapMap consortium (1.14 genotyped polymorphic
SNPs per kilobase). The mismatches covering coding regions were
about 130 and of these roughly 30 were unknown SNPs in each
sample.

All a priori known SNPs, detected in the samples by applying
stande Sanger sequencing, were also obtained by NGS and
conﬁrmed in the GAMES analysis. Additionally, four-ﬁfths of
the novel SNPs detected by NGS/GAMES were experimentally
validated by Sanger sequencing (data not shown).

GAMES was also used for the analysis of mutation segregation,
and parental transmission of mismatches in a whole-exome project.
This technique selectively analyzes the 1% of the genome that
contains genes coding for proteins.

Additionally, we tested GAMES using 2 X 100 bp paired-end
reads produced with Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina) and obtained
essentially comparable results with the single-end runs.

Finally, GAMES was also applied to SOLiD data (25+50bp
paired end) from chronic leukemia samples. The results restated the
ﬂexibility and the accuracy of this pipeline for the mining, sorting
and annotation of genetic variation from different NGS platforms.

4 CONCLUSION

We have developed and validated GAMES, a new application for
the processing and the annotation of NGS data. GAMES generates
concise and highly readable reports for a ﬁinctional selection of
important genetic events. GAMES is a ﬂexible tool, it can be used
for the analysis of data from different NGS platforms, it supports
short and long, single-end and paired-end reads. In fact, GAMES
uses as input the alignment ﬁle in the stande generic SAM format,
which is obtainable from many free and commercial alignment tools.

The speciﬁcity and the accuracy of this application are warranted
by the use of a range of independent ﬁlters, which are geared toward
the selection of statistically and functionally signiﬁcant genetic
events.

The investigator can easily and promptly use GAMES reports to
discriminate silent mutations or polymorphisms from variants that
are potentially associated with a phenotype or a disease. Moreover,
by using BED and MAF ﬁles as tracks in UCSC Genome Browser or
other viewers, it is possible to swiftly identify mutations in different
samples or individuals and to interrogate their biological relevance.
SIFT and POLYPHEN-2 outputs can be used to predict the effect of
the mutations in proteins.

In conclusion, GAMES is not only a new application for mining
ﬁinctional SNPs or InDels from NGS data, but it also aids in
the overall interpretation of large-scale sequencing data. GAMES’
primary purpose is to provide a tool for life science investigators,
who do not have bioinforrnatic expertise, to obtain biological insight
into genetic events.

Abstract

Summary: Currently available bisulfite sequencing tools frequently suffer from low mapping rates
and low methylation calls, especially for data generated from the lllumina sequencer, NextSeq.
Here, we introduce a sequential trimming—and—retrieving alignment approach for investigating
DNA methylation patterns, which significantly improves the number of mapped reads and covered
CpG sites. The method is implemented in an automated analysis toolkit for processing bisulfite
sequencing reads.

1 Introduction

The advancement of next-generation sequencing technologies offers
the opportunity to investigate the epigenetic modification on gen-
ome-wide scale and at single-base resolution (Krueger et (11., 2012).
Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) has emerged as
a popular tool for profiling DNA methylation at CpG rich regions.
A major advantage of the RRBS method is its reproducibility over
time and sample types. Compared with traditional enrichment based
methods, RRBS is more applicable to formalin-fixed and paraffin-
embedded clinical samples, due to its low DNA input requirement.
However, there are considerable challenges when analyzing
the reads from RRBS due to the complexity induced by the
bisulfite conversion. Highly specialized analysis pipelines are
needed—to target different data types and different platforms.

Bisulfite treatment converts all Lin-methylated cytosines into ura-
cils, which causes a C-to-T change in forward strand reads.
Consequently, the processing of RRBS library reads involves two
steps: the alignment of converted reads and the calling of methyla-
tion level lie the methylated/unmethylated ratio) on each site. The
challenge in the mapping of converted reads to reference genome
has been extensively studied and multiple methylation-aware align-
ment algorithms and associated pipelines have been proposed, such
as BRAT (Harris et (11., 2010, 2012; Krueger and Andrews, 2011; Xi
et (11., 2012). In this manuscript, we specifically consider the issue of
low alignment performance caused by variable sequencing quality.
As shown in the Supplementary Figure S1, we often see low read
quality for the first few bases of a read, a pattern consistent across

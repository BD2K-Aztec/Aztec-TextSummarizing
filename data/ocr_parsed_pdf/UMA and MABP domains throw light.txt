ABSTRACT

Interactions of the ESCRT complexes are critical for endosomal
trafficking. We identify two domains with potential significance forthis
process. The MABP domain present in metazoan ESCRT-I/MVBf2
subunits, Crag, a regulator of protein sorting, and bacterial pore-
forming proteins might mediate novel membrane interactions in
trafficking. The UBAP1-MVB12-associated UMA domain found in
MVB12 and UBAP1 defines a novel adaptor that might recruit diverse
targets to ESCRT-l.

1 INTRODUCTION

A key aspect of eukaryotic intracellular trafﬁcking is the sorting
of cell-surface proteins into multi-vesicular endosomes or bodies
(MVBs), which eventually fuse with the lysosome, where they are
degraded by lipases and peptidases. This is the primary mechanism
for downregulation of signaling via transmembrane receptors and
removal of misfolded or defective membrane proteins (Raiborg and
Stenmark, 2009). This process is also utilized by several viruses
(e.g. HIV-1) to facilitate budding of their virions from the cell
membrane (Morita et (11., 2007). Studies in animals and fungi
have shown that it depends on an intricate series of interactions,
which is initiated via ubiquitination (typically one or more mono-
ubiquitinations) of the cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins by
speciﬁc E3 ligases (d’Azzo et (11., 2005). Ubiquitinated membrane
proteins are then captured into endosomes by the ESCRT system
and prevented from being recycled back to the plasma membrane
via the retrograde trafﬁcking system. The ESCRT system also folds
the endosomal membranes into invaginations that are concentrated
in these ubiquitinated targets and catalyzes their abscission into
intraluminal vesicles inside the endosome. This largely seals the fate
of these membrane proteins as targets for lysosomal degradation.
The ESCRT system is comprised of four major protein complexes,
ESCRT-0 to ESCRT-III, which are successively involved in the
above-described steps (Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009). ESCRT-0,
containing proteins with multiple Ub-binding modules, is the
primary sensor for ubiquitinated membrane proteins. Both ESCRT-I
and ESCRT-II have proteins with a single Ub-binding domain
and are subsequent successive recipients of the ubiquitinated

cargo. ESCRT-II proteins also contain lipid-binding modules and
are likely to initiate invagination of the endosomal membrane.
ESCRT-III, which includes the conserved AAA+ ATPase VPS4
as a component, mediates the ﬁnal abscission of the invaginated
membrane to form the intraluminal vesicle. In this relay, ESCRT-I
is the critical bridge between the sensor of ubiquitinated targets and
the membrane-binding ESCRT-II. ESCRT-I contains three subunits
that are conserved between yeast and animals, namely the inactive
E2-ligase protein TSG101/V P523, VPS28 and VPS37 (Raiborg and
Stenmark, 2009). Additionally, both yeast and metazoan ESCRT-I
contain a fourth subunit termed MVB12 [‘multivesicular body
sorting factor of 12kD’ (Chu et (11., 2006)]; however, the MVB12
subunits from the two lineages do not show signiﬁcant sequence
similarity (Audhya et (11 ., 2007; Chu et (11 ., 2006; Konishi et (11., 2006;
Morita et (11 ., 2007). Metazoan MVB 12 was shown to be critical for
receptor endocytosis and also virus release (Morita et (11., 2007).
Given its key role in receptor downregulation, we were interested in
understanding if the lack of detectable similarity with yeast MVB12
might reﬂect emergence of novel adaptations in animals.

Accordingly, we analyzed the animal MVB12 proteins using
sensitive sequence and structure analysis methods and identiﬁed
two novel conserved domains in them. Identiﬁcation of these
domains allowed us to detect several putative, uncharacterized
ESCRT-I subunits in animals. Characterization of these domains
also provides new insights into recognition of cargo by endosomal
sorting regulators.

2 METHODS

Proﬁle searches were conducted using the PSI-BLAST program (Altschul
21111., 1997) with a default proﬁle inclusion expectation (E)-Value threshold of
0.01. Proﬁleiproﬁle comparisons were performed using the HHpred program
(Soding at (11., 2005). Hidden Markov model searches were conducted
using JACKHMMER from the HMMER3 package (Eddy, 2008). Multiple
alignments were constructed using Kalign (Lassmann and Sonnharnmer,
2005) followed by manual adjustments based on PSI-BLAST results. Protein
secondary structure was predicted using a multiple alignment as the input
for the JPRED program (Cuff at (11., 1998). The 3D structures were rendered
using the PYMOL program (http://www.pymol.org/).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Identiﬁcation of the UMA and MABP domains

To investigate the relationships of the animal MVB12, we used
the closely related human paralogs MVB12A (FAM125A; gi:
24308440) and MVB12B (FAM125B; gi: 58761488) as seeds
for sequence proﬁle searches with the PSI-BLAST program and

6). These ﬁndings indicated that the metazoan MVB12 proteins
contain two distinct conserved domains that occur independently in
various proteins (Figs 1 and 2; the MVB12 orthologs are currently
grouped as a single-domain model DUF2464 in the PFAM database,
which does not detect the other homologous proteins identiﬁed in
the current study).

Furthermore, searches with the N-terminal domain of MVB 12A/B
and the equivalent domain in the DENND4A/B/C and Crag
indicated that it has an internal repeat structure of three homologous
segments. Consistent with this, the structurally characterized
representative, Photorhabdus plu1415, showed that this region
precisely corresponds to a type-I ﬂ-prism domain with an internal
3-fold symmetry (Rosado et (11., 2007). Each of the three subdomains
of the ﬂ-prism structure is a distinctive three-stranded ﬂ-sheet
(Fig. 2B) that was congruent to the repeat units detected in
the sequence searches (Fig. 1B). This domain shares a triradial
symmetry with ﬂ-sheets parallel to the prism axis as in the type-
I ﬂ-prism domains observed in the vitelline membrane outer layer
protein I (VMO-I) and the Bacillus thuringiensis 6-endotoxin
(Shimizu and Morikawa, 1996). However, the topology of the
strands in the ﬂ-sheet of the individual subdomains of the
Photorhabdus plu1415 ﬂ-prism is entirely different (Fig. 2B). We
named this novel domain the MVB12-Associated ﬂ-prism (MABP).
A multiple alignment of the MABP domain showed that majority
of the eukaryotic versions contains a conserved cysteine in the
ﬁrst and third subdomain of the ﬂ-prism (Fig. 1B). We named
the C-terminal domain of MVB12A/B domain, which is shared
with UBAP1 as the QBAPl-MVB12-gssociated (UMA) domain.
A multiple alignment of the UMA domain showed a conserved
proline followed by a hydrophobic residue in the N-terminus and a
nearly absolutely conserved glutamate at the C-terminus (Fig. 1A).
Secondary structure prediction using JPRED suggested that it adopts
an a + 5-fold (Fig. 1A).

3.2 Domain architectures and functional interactions
of MABP and UMA domain proteins

To understand the ﬁinctional signiﬁcance of the MABP and
UMA domains, we systematically determined domain architectures
of the proteins which contain them (Fig. 2A). In addition to
co-occurring with the UMA domain in MVB12 proteins found
in all metazoans, the MABP domain is found independently of
it but ﬁised to several other domains: (i) In a group of related
proteins typiﬁed by Crag and DENND4A/B/C found in metazoans

and ciliates, it is present N-terminal to the triad of domains
known as uDENN, DENN and dDENN (Levivier et (11., 2001).
Additionally, C-terminal to the DENN triad, these proteins have
a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR), a novel Zn—ribbon (ZnR) and
an uncharacterized (it-helical domain. (ii) Two MABP domains
are inserted into the choanoﬂagellate VPS13 ortholog, which also
contains APG2-C and Dysferlin (DysF) domains. (iii) Stand-alone
MABP domains are found in certain fungi. (iv) In stramenopiles,
several architectures are observed including ﬁisions to peptide-N-
glycanase—type transglutarninase and PUG domains (Phytophthora
infestans PITG_02329), to 8 EF-HANDs (EFh) and two Ub-binding
ZnR domains (zUb in Fig. 2A, Rinfestans PITG_06630) and to a
Sec7 domain (Phaeodactylum PHATRDRAFT_49198). Two MABP
domains are also found inserted into a deubiquitinating peptidase
(DUB) domain in another Rinfestans protein (PITG_02561; it also
contains six N-terminal zUb Ub-binding ZnRs). (v) In bacteria,
the MABP domain occurs as a solo (e.g. Frankia FRAAL0413),
fused to the C-terminus of a MACPF domain (e.g. plu1415) or
at the N-terminus of a protein with two types of ﬂ-helix repeats
(bH1/2) and a novel cysteine-containing domain (CCD) that are
typical of cell-wall proteins (e.g. C10stridium CLOL250_02048;
Fig. 2A and Supplementary Material). In eukaryotes, several of
the ﬁised domains have been implicated in trafﬁcking machinery:
the DENN domain is a Rab GEF that is required for Rab35-
mediated recycling of endosomal proteins and trafﬁcking of surface
proteins to the apical membrane (Allaire et (11., 2010). VPSl3
and APG2-C domains have been implicated in protein cycling
through the trans-Golgi network and formation of vesicles targeted
for autophagy (Rampoldi et (11., 2001). The other ﬁisions are to
DUBs and deglycanases that are also involved in the sorting of
cargo in the trafﬁcking process (Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009;
Yoshida and Tanaka, 2010). In particular, the Ub-binding ZnRs
associated with the MABP domain in at least two proteins have
been found to bind monoubiquitin, a key trafﬁcking signal (Raiborg
and Stenmark, 2009). MABP domain-containing Drosophila Crag
protein localizes to endosomal vesicle and plasma membranes
(Denef et (11., 2008). Likewise, bacterial proteins with MABP-
MACPF domains have been suggested to target membranes (Rosado
et (11., 2007). Vertebrate MACPF proteins contain a fusion to
the lipid-binding C2 in place of the MABP domain. These
contextual connections suggest that the MABP domain has a
membrane-associated ﬁinction, perhaps even speciﬁc interactions
with membrane components. The structure of the MABP domain
in plu1415 reveals several exposed hydrophobic residues that are

consistent with such an interaction. Hence, it is plausible that the
eukaryotic MABP domains are adaptors that help linking other
associated domains found in the same polypeptide to vesicular
membranes.

In MVB12, the region including the UMA domain, but not the
MABP domain, has been shown to interact with the N-terminal
part of VPS37 and the C-terminal part of TSG101, both ESCRT-
I components (Morita et (11., 2007). This suggests that the UMA
domain probably speciﬁcally recruits MVB12 to the ESCRT-I
complex to form a quaternary complex. In UBAP1 and LOC390595,
the UMA domain is ﬁised to three C-terminal UBA domains, which
are known to bind ubiquitin (Raiborg and Stenmark, 2009). Hence,
they could interact via the UBA domains with ubiquitinated tails of
membrane proteins, while their UMA domains recruit them to the
core ESCRT-I complex. The remaining UMA domain proteins (e.g.
tcag7.903 group; Fig. 2A) have their own conserved N-terminal
extensions that could potentially interact with speciﬁc protein
partners. Based on these observations, we propose that the different
UMA domain proteins might ﬁinction as alternative MVB12-like
subunits that recruit different targets via their speciﬁc interaction
modules (such as MABP or UBA or the speciﬁc extensions) to the
ESCRT-I complex. Thus, different types of UMA domains are likely
to be required for downregulation of different sets of receptors in
animals.

4 GENERALCONCLUSONS

Identiﬁcation of the MABP and UMA domains throws light
on two vital aspects of vesicular trafﬁcking. First, the MABP
domain could be a common denominator in the recognition of
speciﬁc membrane-associated features by a functionally diverse
set of trafﬁcking proteins in eukaryotes and bacterial proteins
involved in pore formation and cell-wall interaction. The prediction
that the diverse metazoan UMA domain proteins are alternative
MVB12-like proteins implies that the recruitment of ESCRT-I to
endosomal structures could occur via diverse mechanisms, including
the possible direct recognition of membranes by the MABP
domain, interaction with ubiquitinated peptides or other protein—
protein interactions. This could have been a response to the vast
expansion of diverse signaling receptors such as receptor tyrosine
kinases, ion channels and 7TM receptors in the metazoan lineage.
Intriguingly, we found that plants (e.g. Arabidopsis AT5G53330)
have a conserved protein that has a series of C-terminal UBA
domains closely related to those found in UBAP1. While we failed
to ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant similarity between the N-terminal
region of these plant proteins and the UMA domain, they share a
few tantalizing sequence patterns. It cannot be ruled out that these
plant proteins contain a region remotely related to the UMA domain
and perform a comparable ﬁinction in relation with the ESCRT
system.

While certain core components of this system (e.g. VPS4
and MIT domains of ESCRT-III) have been traced to archaea
(Hobel et (11., 2008), the MABP domain is not currently found in
any archaea. Instead it is found in diverse bacteria, suggesting that
the eukaryotes could have acquired it early in their evolution from a
bacterial precursor. Thus, the eukaryotic vesicular trafﬁcking system
appears to have been pieced together from different components
acquired from both archaeal and bacterial precursors.

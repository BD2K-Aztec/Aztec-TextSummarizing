ABSTRACT

Motivation: Network-based representations of biological data
have become an important way to analyze high-throughput data.
To interpret the large amount of data that is produced by
different high-throughput technologies, networks offer multifaceted
aspects to analyze the data. As networks represent biological
relationships within their structure, it turned out to be fruitful to
analyze their topology. Therefore, we developed a freely available,
open source R-package called Quantitative Analysis of Complex
Networks (QuACN) to meet this challenge. QuACN contains different,
information-theoretic and non-information-theoretic, topological
network descriptors to analyze, classify and compare biological
networks.

Availability: QuACN is freely available under LGPL via CRAN
(http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/QuACN/).

1 INTRODUCTION

To analyze structural data, networks have become more and more
a key technology in Systems Biology (Palsson, 2009). Examples
of underlying networks are biological pathways, protein—protein
interactions, correlation networks, mutual information networks, etc.
(Junker and Schreiber, 2008). Clearly, graph theoretical concepts
like classical graph descriptors, e.g. degree distribution, clustering
coefﬁcients or betweenness, can be used to analyze complex
biological networks. These descriptors help to generate statements
about network characteristics like hubs, clusters, modules, etc.
(Junker and Schreiber, 2008).

Additionally, there exists a large number of more sophisticated and
expressive graph measures using information theory. For example,
Todeschini et (11. (2002) lists a large number of descriptors that
can be used to analyze molecular networks. They can also be
utilized to analyze complex biological networks, e.g. gene networks,
protein—protein interaction networks, etc. However, a study to
investigate the performance of these descriptors on biological
networks does not exist so far. Moreover, the biological meaning
of these descriptors (Todeschini et (11., 2002), has not been explored
until now.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Topological descriptors can be used to classify (Mueller et (11.,
2010) and compare (Kugler et (11., 2010) correlation networks
created from microarray data and to characterize chemical
compounds in order to identifying potential drug targets (Dehmer
et (11., 2009a), etc.

We implemented a selection of sophisticated topological network
measures and provide them as a package for the free and open source
software environment R. R offers several packages and methods to
infer networks from biological data [e.g. minet (Meyer et (11 ., 2008)
or WGCNA (Langfelder and Horvath, 2010)], which can be directly
analyzed with QuACN.

Topological descriptors can be used to classify and compare
correlation networks created from micro-array data as published
in Mueller et (11. (2010) and Kugler et (11. (2010), to characterize
chemical compounds identifying potential drug targets (Dehmer
et (11., 2009a), etc.

Little is known what network characteristics can be captured
using topological descriptors exactly. We recommend QuACN to
investigate the behavior of topological network measures on large
complex networks. Further, we hope that the package will be helpful
when exploring questions concerning the structure of biological
networks in the context of systems biology.

2 METHODS

The R-package QuACN contains various topological network descriptors.
that can be used to analyze biological networks, out of following classes
based on Dehmer et al. (2009a):

(1) Descriptors based on distances in a graph: this class contains
measures using distances to describe the networks structure.

(2) Descriptors based on other graph invariants: the descriptors in this
class use other graph invariants than distances (e.g. degree. number
of nodes. number of edges. etc.).

(3

V

Partition-based graph entropy descriptors: these measures use an
arbitrary graph invariant and an equivalence criteria to induce
partitions. A probability value is calculated for each partition to
determine the entropy, based on the entropy formula of Shannon
(Shannon and Weaver, 1997).

(4) Parametric graph entropy measures: to determine the entropy
measures of this class (Dehmer et al.. 2009b). by assigning a
probability value to each vertex of the network, using the so-called
information functionals.

An overview of the implemented methods is shown in Figure 1. To
demonstrate the performance of QuACN, Table 1 shows some selected
network measures applied to small sample graphs with different topological
characteristics (see Fig. 1). One can see that the descriptors capture different
network topologies (e.g. branching) in a different manner.

We chose to use R because it is open source and there already exist
packages to handle graphs [e.g. graph (Gentleman et al.. 2009) or igraph
(Csardi and Nepusz. 2006)]. To analyze graphs or networks with QuACN
they have to be represented by a grathEL-object of the Bioconductor-
package graph. We picked grathEL as the base object, because this offers
several advantages. First. the graph package provides a variety of methods
to import already existing networks using adjacency matrices, node-edge
list or the Graph Markup Language (GML). Secondly. it is possible to
convert grathEL objects into igraph-objects and Vice versa. This offers
the possibility to use the wide range of graph-theoretical methods provided
by the igraph package.

3 DISCUSSION

There exist a few stand-alone applications (Lee et (11., 2002;
Todeschini et (11., 2003) to calculate topological descriptors, which
are designed to work with molecular networks. Due to the fact that
R is commonly used in the ﬁeld of bioinformatics and that biological
networks are not stored in molecular ﬁle formats, a new R package
has been developed. R offers a wide range of methods to import
existing networks and biological data.

QuACN contains a selection of topological network descriptors to
analyze, classify and compare complex networks. We want to direct
one’s attention to the parametric graph entropy measures that are,
at the moment, only available within this package. They facilitate
to exploit machine learning techniques to derive hypothesis from
complex biological datasets.

QuACN is a a powerful open source package for the analysis of
complex biological networks. In ﬁiture work, we plan to apply the
integrated measures on various biological research questions, and
extending the range of functions with new promising descriptors for
the coming versions of QuACN.

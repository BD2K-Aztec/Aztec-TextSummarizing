ABSTRACT

Summary: We present Mutascope, a sequencing analysis pipeline
specifically developed for the identification of somatic variants present
at low-allelic fraction from high-throughput sequencing of amplicons
from matched tumor-normal specimen. Using datasets reproducing
tumor genetic heterogeneity, we demonstrate that Mutascope has a
higher sensitivity and generates fewer false-positive calls than tools
designed for shotgun sequencing or diploid genomes.

1 INTRODUCTION

The accurate detection of somatic mutations in tumors is critical for
precise diagnostic and selection of targeted therapies (Boyd, 2013),
but the low-allelic fraction frequently encountered in heterogeneous
or poor cellularity clinical specimens renders this task challenging. In
current clinical assays, amplicons covering the exons of 1(P100
cancer genes are ampliﬁed Via polymerase chain reaction-based or
analogous approaches and sequenced at high depth to identify mu-
tations present in <5 % of a DNA sample (Harismendy et al., 2011).
Despite high coverage depth, the error rate resulting from systematic
sequencing bias (Harismendy et al., 2009), can hinder the detection
of mutations. Although experimental (Hiatt et al., 2013) or analytical
(McKenna et al., 2010) methods, or comparison with the normal
DNA (Cibulskis et al., 2013; Koboldt et al., 2012) can mitigate
this effect, most analysis strategies were developed for sequencing
of random shotgun DNA fragments, and thus do not take into ac-
count systematic errors speciﬁc to amplicon sequencing. In amplicon
sequencing, loci are covered by reads with identical genomic starting
positions, and because the error rate increases along the length of the
read (Fig. 1a), a variable consensus error rate exists over the target
(Fig. 1b). Analytical strategies specifically designed for amplicon
sequencing have the potential to enhance the mutation detection
accuracy of current clinical assays, especially at low-allelic fraction.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Here, we present Mutascope, a software dedicated to the detection
of mutations at low-allelic fraction from amplicon sequencing of
matched tumor-normal samples pairs. Mutascope determines the
amplicon of origin for each read and measures the speciﬁc experi-
mental error rate from sequencing the normal DNA. The mutations
in the tumor are then identified by comparison with the error rate
using a binomial statistics and classified as germ line or somatic by
comparison with the normal DNA. A set of filters adapted to ampli-
con sequencing then eliminates false-positive calls. We used two ex-
perimental datasets, a mixture of 8 normal DNA (MIX) and a set of
80 tumor-normal spiked-in (TNS) pairs derived from 38 different
normal germ line DNA samples to measure the performance of
the approach in comparison with other mutation callers.

2 METHODS

Data generation: The data from the MIX sample or used in the preparation of
the TNS pairs was generated using microdroplet polymerase chain reaction
ampliﬁcation (Harismendy et al., 2011) of 1736 amplicons from 47 genes
clinically actionable for breast cancer (Supplementary Methods), followed
by high-throughput sequencing of 151 nt long paired-end reads on a MiSeq
sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) resulting in 981-fold average
coverage depth. The data are available through the Short Reads Archive
(SRA) at the NCBI (SRA067609 and SRA067610).

Analysis principle: Mutascope aligns the reads to the genome using BWA-SW
algorithm (Li and Durbin, 2009). Multi-mapping reads, reads with a low Smithi
Watterman score, or not aligning to the speciﬁed amplicons are removed.
Mutascope then determines the amplicon of origin for each read and measures
the error rate using the normal DNA sequencing, stratified by the major drivers
of sequencing errors: nucleotide, position in the read and read type (forward or
reverse). The allelic fraction of the mutation is compared with this error rate
using a binomial test for signiﬁcance; the mutations are then classiﬁed as germ
line or somatic using a Fisher exact test. The germ line genotypes are determined
using a Bayesian likelihood method. Finally, Mutascope ﬁlters out false-positive
variants using, for example, read group bias, low-average mutant allele quality
or predicted false positive from non-speciﬁc ampliﬁcation.

Benchmarking: The benchmarking was performed using ROCR package
(Sing et al., 2005). The prediction score used for the classiﬁcation corres-
ponded to the binomial P—value for Mutascope, somatic P-value for
VarScan (Koboldt et al., 2012), tumor Fstar LOD score for MuTect
(Cibulskis et al., 2013) and VCF quality score for LoFreq, GAT K and
Illumina MiSeq Reporter (McKenna et al., 2010; Wilm et al., 2012). All
false-negative prediction scores were set to 0. All benchmarked tools relied
on the same alignment performed by Mutascope, except for Illumina MiSeq
reporter that performs its own alignment. Whenever allowed, each tool was
run without extensive previous ﬁltering to strictly compare the accuracy of the
mutation detection. Complete methods are available as Supplementary
Methods.

3 RESULTS

We benchmarked Mutascope against other mutation callers using
sequencing data generated from a mixture of 8 normal DNA samples
with known genotypes (MIX sample) resulting in ‘somatic mutations’
at variable allelic fraction. The classiﬁcation of the 162 somatic mu-
tations at low-allelic fraction (0.014).1) by Mutascope was more ac-
curate than other standard tools (area under the curve: 0.97—Fig. 10).
Not surprisingly, tools designed to identify heterozygotes in diploid
genomes were missing most mutations (GATK), whereas tools dedi-
cated to tumor-normal pairs performed better WarScan and
MuTect). To estimate the impact of coverage depth, we selected
reads from the MIX sample down to 50 or 10% (490 and 98X,
respectively) of the maximum. As expected, the sensitivity decreased
equally for all the tools considered (Fig. 1d).

To expand the performance evaluation to additional mutations
and experimental conditions, we prepared a set of 80 TNS pairs by
mixing reads obtained from sequencing 38 normal DNA. Using

these, we interrogated 402 unique ‘somatic mutations’ (between 17
and 55 per pair) at an allelic fraction of 0.01 or 0.1 (40 pairs each).
Mutascope was more accurate to detect mutations at an allelic frac-
tion of 0.1 rather than 0.01 (Fig. 1e), and in the former case, its
performance was comparable with MuTect and superior to
VarScan or LoFreq.

Finally, we tested the effect of the empirical filters applied by each
tool after the classiﬁcation. These ﬁlters are important to eliminate
false positives resulting from unpredictable sources of error and not
accounted for by the statistical model. Although Mutascope’s filters,
such as the read group bias and non-speciﬁc ampliﬁcation, are spe-
cifically compatible with amplicons sequencing, we adjusted the par-
ameters of the other tools to ensure a fair comparison, such as strand
bias and minimum alternate allele frequency ﬁlters. When applied to
the mutations at low-allelic fraction in the MIX samples, these ﬁlters
increase the sensitivity and positive predictive value (Fig. If and
Supplementary Discussion). The set of high-confidence filters from
MuTect affects the sensitivity the most. This observation highlights
synergies between Mutascope’s two core statistical components: the
experimentally driven mutation detection (binomial test) and tumor-
normal comparison (Fisher test) resulting in a superior performance.

Therefore, by design, Mutascope specifically optimizes the muta-
tion detection and ﬁltering for deep amplicon sequencing. The
resulting higher accurate detection of somatic mutations at low-
allelic fraction increases utility in cancer molecular diagnostics.

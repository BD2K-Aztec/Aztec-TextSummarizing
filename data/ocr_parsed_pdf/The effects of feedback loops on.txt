ABSTRACT

Motivation: In general, diseases are more likely to be comorbid if
they share associated genes or molecular interactions in a cellular
process. However, there are still a number of pairs of diseases which
show relatively high comorbidity but do not share any associated
genes or interactions. This observation raises the need for a novel
factor which can explain the underlying mechanism of comorbidity.
We here consider a feedback loop (FBL) structure ubiquitously found
in the human cell signaling network as a key motif to explain the
comorbidity phenomenon, since it is well known to have effects on
network dynamics.

Results: For every pair of diseases, we examined its comorbidity
and length of all FBLs involved by the disease-associated genes in
the human cell signaling network. We found that there is a negative
relationship between comorbidity and length of involved FBLs. This
indicates that a disease pair is more likely to comorbid if they are
connected with FBLs of shorter length. We additionally showed
that such a negative relationship is more obvious when the number
of positive involved FBLs is larger than that of negative involved
FBLs. Moreover, we observed that the negative relationship between
comorbidity and length of involved FBLs holds especially for disease
pairs that do not share any disease-associated genes. Finally, we
proved all these results through intensive simulations, based on a
Boolean network model.

1 INTRODUCTION

When two disorders or illnesses occur in the same person,
simultaneously or one after the other, they are called comorbid.
It is reported that 80% of the elderly population has three or
more chronic conditions (Caughey et (11., 2008), which explains
the importance of understanding disease comorbidity. There have
been many studies observing the comorbidity phenomenon. Some
studies have found high comorbidity rates of certain pairs of diseases
(Gabriel and Michaud, 2009; Raja and Azzoni et (11., 2008; Ye et (11.,
2005) and addressed statistical results of prevalence and mortality
of speciﬁed regions (Caughey et (11., 2008; Tetsche et (11., 2008).
Other studies attempted to quantify the effect of a disease on other

diseases by introducing comorbidity measures (Kelli et (11., 2005;
Tang et (11., 2008). In a recent study of illness progression, a database
was also constructed to summarize statistical correlations between
phenotypic diseases from histories of more than 30 million patients
in a phenotypic disease network (Hidalgo et (11., 2009).

Another class of previous studies investigated factors to explain
the cause of comorbidity. For example, Goh et (11. (2007) constructed
a human disease network in which a pair of diseases are linked when
they share common disease-causing genes, and showed a common
genetic origin of many diseases from this constructed network.
In another study, Park et (11. (2009) found statistically signiﬁcant
correlations between an underlying structure of cellular networks
and comorbidity patterns in the human population by combining
information on protein interactions, disease-gene associations and
population-level disease patterns extracted from Medicare data. In
that paper, the authors showed positive correlations between the
degree of comorbidity, the number of shared genes and the number
of shared protein interactions. A bipartite graph was also constructed
in which nodes represent diseases and two diseases are linked if
mutated enzymes associated with them catalyze adjacent metabolic
reactions (Lee et (11., 2008). Based on this graph, it was shown
that two connected metabolic diseases sharing some pathways tend
to show signiﬁcant comorbidity. This result is consistent with a
general proteomic notion that diseases may be related if they share
protein interactions (Park et (11., 2009) or proteins acting on the same
pathway (Calvano et (11., 2005; Goehler et (11., 2004; Lim et (11.,
2006; Oldham et (11., 2006; Pujana et (11., 2007; Rual et (11., 2005;
Stelzl et (11., 2005). Taken together, it can be generally accepted
that diseases that share associated genes or molecular interactions
in a cellular process are more likely to be comorbid. However, it is
interesting that many pairs of diseases show high comorbidity even
though they do not share any associated genes or interactions (Park
et (11., 2009). Therefore, there is still a pressing need to ﬁnd other
factors which is related to comorbidity.

In this study, we consider a FBL (FBL) structure as a novel factor
to explain the comorbidity phenomenon. FBLs are a well-known
critical motif to affect dynamics in biological networks (Mendoza
et (11., 1999; Milo et (11., 2002; Prill et (11., 2005; Snoussi, 1998;
Yeger-Lotem et (11., 2004). In particular, FBLs were shown to play an
important role in robustly sustaining steady state of networks against
perturbations (Kwon and Cho, 2008; Kwon et (11., 2007). In this
regard, we investigated the relationship between comorbidity and
FBLs involved with disease-associated genes in a human signaling
network. Using integrated data from a disease—gene association
database and a human cell-signaling network, we show that there
is a negative relationship between comorbidity and the length of

involved FBLs. In other words, a pair of diseases is highly comorbid
if their associated genes are connected with FBLs of relatively short
length. It is interesting to note that this relationship is valid especially
for disease pairs that do not share any associated genes. Moreover,
such a negative relationship is more clearly observed when positive
FBLs are more abundant than negative FBLs between a disease pair.
We also show the negative relationship between comorbidity and
the length of FBLs through intensive simulations, based on random
Boolean network models.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

To obtain comorbidity information between pairs of diseases, we used the
published dataset (Park at (11., 2009) containing two quantiﬁed comorbidity
values, relative risk (RR) and ¢-correlation coefﬁcient (PHI), for a total of
83 924 disease pairs. The two comorbidity measures were deﬁned as RR:
Cij/C; and PHI=(NCij —IiI]-)/, /Iin(N—Ii)(N—Ij), respectively, where N
is the number of patients, 1, denotes incidence of disease 1, Ci]- denotes the
number of patients who were simultaneously diagnosed with diseases 1 and
j, respectively and C;- :1in /N . In that study, the Medicare database which
includes the clinical history of 13 039 018 patients was used for comorbidity
evaluation. When two diseases cooccur more frequently than expected by
chance, we have RR>1 and PHI >0. Each measure was reported to carry
unique biases that are complementary (Hidalgo 21111., 2009). Additionally, we
deﬁned the morbidity of a disease 1 as I, / N (i.e. the prevalence of a disease).

In this aarticle, we analyze a large-scale human signaling network to
ﬁnd a topological characteristic related to the comorbidity phenomenon. To
this end, we ﬁrst obtained the human signaling network (Cui at (11., 2007)
which had been built up by integrating one cancer-related signaling network
obtained from Cancer Cell Map (http://cancer.cellmap.org/cellmap/), and
three general signaling networks, which are not cancer-speciﬁc, obtained
from BioCarta (http://www.biocarta.com) and two previous results of
Ma’ayan et a1. (2005) and Awan et a1. (2007), respectively. We removed
62 small molecules such as Ca‘l'T, glucocorticoid, and H202 and their
interactions from the network. As a result, the network consisting of 1517
nodes and 4761 links was constructed for this investigation (Table S1 in
Supplementary Material). In addition, we also obtained the entire list of
disease-gene associations from the previous study (Park at (11., 2009). After
matching these databases (See Figure S1 in Supplementary Material for more
details of database relationship diagram), we ﬁnally constructed a list of 334
diseases, their associated genes (Table S2 in Supplementary Material) and
their corresponding names (Table S3 in Supplementary Material). We also
collected comorbidity values of 18 896 pairs of those diseases (Table S4 in
Supplementary Material).

2.2 Deﬁnitions of topological properties in a network

We deﬁned some topological properties with respect to either a single gene or
a set of genes. In this article, we consider a network represented by a directed
graph G=(V,A), where V is a set of nodes and A is the set of ordered pairs
of the nodes called directed links. A directed link (Vi, Vj) is assigned with
either a positive (‘activating’) or negative (‘inhibiting’) relationship from
V, e V to Vj e V. When the human signaling network is represented by G(V,
A), we denote the set of genes associated with a disease D by V(D)§ V
and then |V(D)| represents the number of genes associated with D. For a
gene V we consider the connectivity of V which is deﬁned as the number
of links involving V. Moreover, connectivity of D is deﬁned as the average
connectivity over the set of genes in V(D).

In this article, we consider FBLs as an important topological property.
FBLs are ubiquitously found and play an important role in dynamical
behaviors of cellular signaling networks (Milo at (11., 2002; Prill at (11.,
2005; Yeger-Lotem at (11., 2004). A FBL is deﬁned as a circular chain of

relationships. For example, given a network G(V,A), V0 —> V] —> V; —> 
VL_1 —> VL is a FBL of length L(Z 2) if there are links from Vi_1 to V, for
all i=1,2,...,L with VQZVL and ijévk forj, ke{0,1,...,L—1}, then the
number of FBLs involved with a node V, denoted by NuFBL(V), is deﬁned
as the number of different FBLs involved with V. Similarly, the number of
FBLs involved with a disease D, denoted by NuFBL(D), is deﬁned as the
average NuFBL(V) over {V|V e V(D)}. In addition, the sign of a FBL is easily
determined by the parity of the number of negative relationships involved.
If the parity number is even or zero, the sign is positive; otherwise, it is
negative. We denote the number of positive and negative FBLs by NuFBL+
and NuFBL_ , respectively.

To analyze topological properties between a pair of nodes or diseases, we
extend the deﬁnitions with respect to FBLs, as follows. Given a network
G(V,A) and a pair of nodes VE V and V’ e V, we call V and V’ connected
with a FBL of a maximal length L if there exists at least one FBL of length
5L involved with both V and V’. In a similar way, when G(V,A) represents
the human signaling network and a pair of diseases, D and DI, are given,
D and D’ are called connected with a FBL of a maximal length L if there
exists at least one pair of genes, V e V(D) and V’ e V(D’),such that V and V’
are connected with a FBL of a maximal length L. Additionally, we denote
the number of FBLs between a pair of nodes or diseases by NuFBL(V, V’) or
NuFBL(D, D’), respectively.

2.3 Deﬁnitions of dynamical properties in a network

To prove our hypothesis, we employed a Boolean network model, which has
been widely used to represent biological networks and successfully captured
some biological characteristics (Kauffman at (11., 2003; Kauffman at (11.,
2004; Kwon and Cho, 2007; Shmulevich at (11., 2003, 2005). In particular, it
has been also frequently used in simulating the dynamics of various signaling
networks such as a guard cell abscisic acid signaling (Saadatpour at (11.,
2010), a central intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathway (Mai and Liu, 2009;
Schlatter at (11., 2009), a mammalian Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
(EGFR) signaling pathway (Sahin at (11., 2009), a T-cell receptor signaling
(Saez-Rodriguez at (11., 2007), a neurotransmitter signaling pathway (Saez-
Rodriguez et (11., 2007) and so on.

2.3.1 A random Boolean network When a Boolean network is represented
by a directed graph G(V, A), each Vi EV has a value of 1 (‘on’) or 0 (‘off’),
which represents the possible states of the corresponding elements. The
value of each variable V, at time t+1 is determined by the values of k,
other variables Vi1,V,»2,...,V,»ki, with a link to V, at time t by the Boolean
functionﬁ : {0, 1}ki —> {0, 1}. Hence, we can write the update rule as Vi(t+ 1):
ﬁ(V,»1,V,»2,...,V,»ki) where we randomly select either a logical conjunction
or disjunction for all signed relationships in )3 with a uniform probability
distribution. For example, if a Boolean variable V has a positive relationship
from V], a negative relationship from V; and a positive relationship from
V3, then the conjunction and disjunction update rules are V(l+1)=v1(I)/\
V2 /\ V3 (1) and V(t +1): V1(t)\/ 172(1) \/ V3 (t), respectively. In the case of a
conjunction, the value of V at time 1+ 1 is 1 only if the values of V1 , V2 and V3
at time t are 1, O and 1, respectively whereas, in the case of a disjunction, the
value of V at time t+1 is 1 if at least one of the states of the clauses, V1(t),
172(1), and V3(t) is 1. Although there can be many other logical functions in
addition to conjunction and disjunction functions, biological networks were
successfully described by Boolean models using only those two functions
in many previous studies (Albert, 2004; Faure at (11., 2006; Helikar at (11.,
2008; Huang and Ingber, 2000; Kwon and Cho, 2007). In addition, the sign
of each link is determined between positive and negative ones uniformly at
random.

To generate a large number of random Boolean networks, we considered
three models. The ﬁrst model generates random Boolean networks in a way
that the connectivity of every node is Z 1. On the other hand, the second
model generates random Boolean networks in a way that every node has at
least one incoming link and at least one outgoing link. These two models are
denoted as Model-A and Model-B, respectively. The difference between the

two models is that the ﬁrst model permits presence of input and output nodes,
while the second one does not. (An input or output node means one which
has no incoming or outgoing link, respectively, and there is no employed
constraint on the number of input and output nodes in Model-A.) Thus,
the reason why we considered those different models is to show that our
simulation results are not dependent on the presence of input and output nodes
in the Boolean networks. Two Visualization examples of random Boolean
networks generated by Model-A and Model-B are shown in Figure S2 in
Supplementary Material. In addition to the two models, we considered the
other model proposed by Barabasi and Albert (1999) which can generate
random networks with a scale-free property, namely a power-law degree
distribution (see Figure S3 in Supplementary Material for a more detailed
generation process). We employed this model, which is denoted by Model-C,
to examine whether our simulation results also hold for scale-free networks.

Given a Boolean network with N Boolean variables, V1,V2,  ,VN, we
deﬁne a network state as a vector consisting of values of the Boolean
variables: there are 2Nstates in total. Each state transits to another state
through a set of N Boolean update functions, f1 ,f2, . . .,fN. We can construct
a state transition diagram that represents the transition of each state. A state
trajectory starts from an initial state and eventually converges to either
a ﬁxed-point or a limit-cycle attractor. Attractors can represent diverse
behaviors of biological networks, such as multi-stability, homeostasis and
oscillation (Bhalla et a1., 2002; Ferrell et a1., 1998; Pomerening et a1., 2003).
In addition, we deﬁne a transient sequence of values of a node V as follows:
When a Boolean network G(V,A) was initialized with V1(O),V2(0),..., and
VN(0) at the starting time 0, Vi(t0,t1) represents a sequence of the transient
values of a node Vi during the time interval from to to t1.

2.3.2 Mutual-eﬁ‘ectiveness in a random Boolean network In Boolean
networks, we propose a novel measure, mutual-effectiveness, to quantify
the mutual inﬂuence between a pair of nodes or node groups in terms of the
network dynamics. To deﬁne it, we ﬁrst introduce two types of perturbations,
an initial-state perturbation and an updating-rule perturbation. Given a
Boolean network initialized with V1(O),V2(O), . . ., and VN (0), the initial-state
perturbation at a node V, e V means ﬂipping 111(0) to 177(0). On the other hand,
the updating-rule perturbation at a node V, e V means switching the updating-
rule at V7 from a conjunction function to a disjunction function or Vice versa,
depending on the current function type. Assuming a perturbation at V7, we
deﬁne the effectiveness from V, to another node Vj, “(V7, Vj), as follows:

(i) Let 1'7, the valid convergent time of V7, deﬁned as 1',» = max{7}, T; }
where T, or T; represent the time steps for the network to converge to
an attractor when V, was subject to the perturbation or not, respectively.

(ii) We obtain two different transient sequences of Vj, Vj(0, 1'7) and 111,-“), 1'7),
when V, was subject to the perturbation or not, respectively.

(iii) Then, we compute “(V7, Vj) =d(V]-(O, 1'7), 11;“), r,»))/r,» where d(°) means
the Hamming distance (i.e. the number of bits having different values)
between two sequences. Thus, 11(Vi, Vj) represents how largely the
trajectory with respect to Vj was affected by the perturbation at V7.

Since 11 is not commutative, we derive the mutual-effectiveness for a pair
of nodes V7 and Vj , p (Vi, Vj), as follows:

p(VivVj)=(M(Viij)+M(Viji))
2

Therefore, mutual-effectiveness is a measure about how largely each node
is mutually affected by perturbation at the other node in terms of dynamics.
In this regard, mutual-effectiveness in Boolean networks can be used to
represent the comorbidity phenomenon in signaling networks. Figure 1
shows an example of the calculation of mutual-effectiveness of a node pair, V4
and V7. To compute 11(V4, V7), we get two transient sequences of V7, V7 (014)
and V’7(0,r4), when V4 was subject to a perturbation or not, respectively. In
the same way, 11(V7, V4) is computed and ﬁnally p(V4, V7) are obtained by
averaging 11(V4, V7) and 11(V7, V4).

In a Boolean network, a node is called a functional important node if
a perturbation at the node makes the network converge to another attractor,

which is different from the original attractor to which the network converged
when the node was not subject to the perturbation. In this article, we focus
on the mutual effectiveness of only functional important nodes since disease
genes can be considered as a kind which affect the cellular dynamical
behavior. In all simulations of this study, we generated random Boolean
networks, such that the ratio of functionally important nodes over the total
number of nodes is Z 0.05.

3.1 Analysis of morbidity in terms of the number of
disease-associated genes, connectivity and number
of FBLs

Before we investigated comorbidity, we ﬁrst addressed how
well morbidity could be explained in terms of some topological
characteristics in the human signaling network. Morbidity of a
disease was deﬁned as the prevalence of a disease (see Section 2
for the deﬁnition) and three topological properties were considered
for analysis: the number of associated genes of a disease, the
connectivity of a disease and the number of FBLs involved with
a disease (see Section 2 for the deﬁnitions). We plotted the relation
of disease prevalence to each topological property (Fig. 2). This
result shows that the correlation between disease prevalence and the
three topological properties is very small. In other words, morbidity
of a disease is not easy to simply understand in terms of topological
properties in the human signaling network.

3.2 Analysis of comorbidity in terms of length of FBLs
in the human signaling network

We investigated the relationship of FBLs to comorbidity in the
human signaling network as follows: when a length L was speciﬁed,
we collected a set of pairs of diseases which are connected to a
FBL of length 3L (see Section 2 for the deﬁnition) and computed
the average comorbidity over the set of collected pairs of diseases
(Fig. 3). Varying L from 2 to 7, we examined two kinds of
comorbidity values, i.e. RR (Fig. 3a) and PHI (Fig. 3b). RR is
maximal when L is 2 while PHI is so when L is 3. Although there
is such a difference between the peak points of RR and PHI, the
relationship trend between each comorbidity value and the maximal
FBL length is interestingly negative (P-value=0.00324 in Fig. 3a
and P-value = 0.00824 in Fig. 3b). In other words, the comorbidity

value of a pair of diseases is more likely to be high as their associated
genes are involved with FBLs of shorter lengths Considering it was
not easy to ﬁnd any topological property correlated to morbidity
in Figure 2, this ﬁnding is intriguing. Moreover, other topological
properties such as the length of the shortest path between a disease
pair and the number of FBLs connecting a pair of diseases did not
show any obvious relationship to comorbidity values (see Figure 54a
and b in Supplementary Material).

3.3 The effect of FBL length on mutual-effectiveness in
random Boolean networks

To understand why the comorbidity trend is negatively related to
FBL length, we performed extensive simulations based on random
Boolean networks models. We generated 100 random Boolean
networks with |V| = 50 and |A| = 75, collected a group of ﬁinctional
important node pairs, which are connected with a FBL of length 3 L
by varying L from 2 to 10 and examined the mutual-effectiveness
of each group (Fig. 4). We used three kinds of random Boolean
networks models: one that permits the presence of input/output
nodes (Model-A; Fig. 4a), another does not (Model-B; Fig. 4b)
and the other generates scale-free networks (Model-C; Fig. 40) (see
Section 2 for the deﬁnitions). In addition, we considered two types
of perturbations: an initial-state perturbation and an update-rule
perturbation (see Section 2 for the deﬁnitions). We observed a strong
negative relationship between the maximal FBL length and mutual-
effectiveness (all P-values <0.001), irrespective of the generation
models and types of perturbations. Moreover, we also performed
the same simulations with random Boolean networks of different
network sizes (I VI) and different network densities (ratio of |A| over
I V|). We found that the relationship between the maximal FBL length
and mutual-effectiveness is consistently negative, irrespective of
network size and density (See Figure S5 in Supplementary Material).
From these observations, we can conclude that the shorter the
involved FBL length is, the greater the mutual-effectiveness between
two nodes is. Considering that mutual-effectiveness between a pair
of nodes can represent the potential degree of comorbidity, the
simulation result in the random Boolean networks is consistent with
the observation in the human signaling network in Figure 3. In
addition, we conclude that the reason why mutual-effectiveness is
affected by the length of involved FBLs is as follows. A FBL of
longer length involves a large number of other nodes, and thus a
perturbation effect at a point cannot be well transferred to other

points since a number of other nodes are also involved in that
transference. Moreover, other topological properties such as the
length of the shortest path and the number of FBLs between a pair of
nodes did not show any obvious relationship to mutual-effectiveness
values as in the case of comorbidity in Section 3.2 (see Figure 540
and d in Supplementary Material).

3.4 The effect of sign of FBL on comorbidity and
mutual-effectiveness

It was also reported that the dynamic behavior of networks depends
on the sign of FBLs. In terms of converging dynamics, networks
with a relatively large number of positive FBLs are more likely
to induce ﬁxed-point attractors; on the other hand, networks with

Maximal FBL Length [1.]

Fig. 5. Comparisons of the relationship between average comorbidity and
maximal FBL length, according to the majority sign of the involved
FBLs in the human signaling network. Each disease pair is classiﬁed into
two categories: NuFBL+Z NuFBL_ if the number of involved positive
FBLs is larger than or equal to that of involved negative FBLs, and
NuFBL+ <NuFBL_ if otherwise. All the y-axis values represent the average
comorbidity values with a 95% conﬁdence level. Solid and dashed lines
represent a linear regression of ‘NuFBL+Z NuFBL’ and ‘NuFBL+<
NuFBL_’ categories, respectively. (a) Result of RR comorbidity (slopes of
solid and dashed lines are —0.66119 and 0.09495, respectively.) (b) Result
of PHI comorbidity (slopes of solid and dashed lines are —0.00055 and
0.00024, respectively).

a relatively large number of negative FBLs are more likely to
induce limit-cycle attractors (Kwon and Cho, 2007). Therefore, we
further examined the effect of the sign of FBLs on comorbidity in
the signaling network (Fig. 5) and mutual-effectiveness in random
Boolean networks (Fig. 6). When a maximal FBL length L was
speciﬁed, we collected a set of disease pairs, D and D’, which
are connected with a FBL of length 3L and classiﬁed them into
two categories, ‘NuFBL+ 3NuFBL-’ and ‘NuFBL+ <NuFBL_’,
according to difference of NuFBL+ (D, D’) and NuFBL- (D, D’). We
compared comorbidity between those two categories in the human
signaling network (Fig. 5). For both RR and PHI, we observed
that disease pairs belonging to the ‘NuFBL+ 3NuFBL-’ group
showed a clear negative relationship between average comorbidity
and maximal FBL length compared to those belonging to the
‘NuFBL+ <NuFBL_’ group (P-value=0.00229 in Fig. 5a and
P-value=2.277><10_5 in Fig. 5b). The slope difference between
the two groups was larger in the case of PHI than RR. In a
similar way, we examined mutual-effectiveness in random Boolean
networks generated by three models, Model-A (Fig. 6a), Model-B
(Fig. 6b) and Model-C (Fig. 60). For all models, we also observed
that pairs of nodes belonging to the ‘NuFBL+ 3NuFBL_’ group
showed a more outstanding negative relationship between average
of mutual-effective and maximal FBL length than those belonging
to ‘NuFBL+ <NuFBL-’ (For cases of initial-state perturbations,
P-values are 0.00535, 0.02164 and 0.01898 in Fig. 6a, b and c,

it was independent of network size and density (See Figure S6 in
Supplementary Material). Taken together, the negative relationship
between comorbidity/mutual-effectiveness and the length of the
involved feedback is more apparent in the casein which the number
of involved positive FBLs is larger than that of the involved negative
FBLs. This may be because positive FBLs are mainly related to
amplifying signals, while negative FBLs play a role in inhibiting
signals (Claire, 2004; Mendoza et (11., 1999).

3.5 The effect of FBLs on comorbidity when there is no
common disease gene

A previous study showed that a disease pair becomes more comorbid
as they share a larger number of disease genes (Park et (11., 2009).
Inspired by the result, we ﬁirther investigated the relationship
between comorbidity and FBL length for the group of disease pairs
that do not share any disease genes (Fig. 7). We classiﬁed every
disease pair into two groups: ‘Shared’ (set of disease pairs having at
least one shared gene) or ‘Not-shared’ (set of disease pairs having no
shared genes). We compared the relationship between comorbidity
and maximal length of FBLs between the two groups. We ﬁrst
observed that the average comorbidity of the ‘Shared’group was
larger than that of the ‘Not-shared’ group (P-value=0.04746 in
Fig. 7a and P-value = 3.046 ><10T5 in Fig. 7b). This means that the
number of shared genes is an important indicator for comorbidity,
as shown in the previous study (Park et (11., 2009). In addition, we
observed that there is a negative relationship between comorbidity

and length of FBLs in the ‘Not-shared’ group (P-value: 0.01352 in
Fig. 7a and P-value = 0.03353 in Fig. 7b), while the relationship is
ambiguous in the ‘Shared’ group (the relationship is even positive in
the case of PHI). This implies that a pair of diseases having no shared
disease gene can be highly comorbid if they are connected with
FBLs of relatively short length. Considering most of pairs of diseases
(18404 disease pairs out of the total 18 896 disease pairs) have no
shared genes, the FBL is also necessary to understand comorbidity.
Table 1 presents examples of disease pairs that do not have any
shared genes but still show high comorbidity. We ﬁnd that there exist
FBLs of relatively short lengths connecting them. Figure 8 shows
a disease pair, adenocarcinoma and lymphoma, having very high
comorbidity values (RR = 3.6934, PHI: 0.0075878), but sharing no
disease gene. This pair of diseases has been often reported to occur
simultaneously in same patients (Lee et (11., 2005; Neil et (11., 2009;
Nishigami et (11., 2010; Nishino et (11., 1996).

4 DSCUSSON

High comorbidity between disease pairs, such as diabetes mellitus
and obesity, or hypertension and spasms, have been observed.
Previous studies explained that such a phenomenon was mostly due
to mutational defects of a common disease gene shared by those
diseases. However, many pairs of other diseases that do not share
any associated gene have also been found, and this may be because
complex molecular interaction networks spread the disorder of a
gene to the other genes. Therefore, careful analysis of signaling
pathways at the system level is needed to understand the comorbidity
mechanism. In particular, we considered FBLs as an important
structural feature for comorbidity, since many previous studies have
revealed that they can make the network dynamics complicated and
nonlinear.

In this regard, we investigated the effect of FBLs in the human
cell signaling network on comorbidity, and showed that disease pairs
connected with a FBL of shorter length make the comorbidity higher
than those connected with an FBL of longer length. In other words, a
pair of diseases is more likely to be comorbid when their associated
genes are involved in FBLs of relatively short lengths. Moreover,
we showed that such a relationship is apparent when the number of
positive involved FBLs is larger than that of negative involved FBLs.

 

Fig. 8. A partial human signaling network with respect to adenocarcinoma
and lymphoma which have 12 and 16 associated genes, respectively. RR and
PHI values of this disease pair are 3.6934 and 0.0075878, respectively. We
note that there is no shared gene between these two diseases but there exist
FBLs of relatively short length. For example, a FBL of length 2 (CASP10
7 CASPS 7| CASP10) and length 3 (CASP10 —> CASP3 —> CASPS 7|
CASP10) are shown, where —>, 7|, and 7 denote activation, inhibitory, and
either neutral or unknown interaction, respectively.

In addition, it was also shown that a pair of diseases connected with
FBLs of relatively short length can be highly comorbid especially
when they do not share any gene. Through intensive simulations
based on Boolean networks, we proved the relationship between
FBLs and comorbidity is a fundamental property with respect to
network dynamics.

In synthetic biology, the ﬁndings of this article can be useful
in order to control mutual-effectiveness between components of an
artiﬁcial cell. Also, the ﬁndings of this study can be considered
evidence showing the useﬁilness of a Boolean network model in
studying the dynamics of biological networks. In addition, it will
be a signiﬁcant future study to ﬁnd out a more realistic measure
than mutual-effectiveness to simulate comorbidity phenomenon in
a Boolean network model.

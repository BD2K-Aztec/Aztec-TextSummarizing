Abstract

Motivation: The enormous number of redundant sequenced genomes haS hindered efforts to ana—
lyze and functionally annotate proteins. AS the taxonomy of viruses is not uniformly defined, viral
proteomes pose special challenges in this regard. Grouping viruses based on the similarity oftheir
proteins at proteome scale can normalize against potential taxonomic nomenclature anomalies.
Results: We present Viral Reference Proteomes (Viral RPS), which are computed from complete
virus proteomes within UniProtKB. Viral RPS based on 95, 75, 55, 35 and 15% co—memberShip in
proteome similarity based clusters are provided. Comparison of our computational Viral RPS
with UniProt’S curator—selected Reference Proteomes indicates that the two setS are consistent
and complementary. Furthermore, each Viral RP represents a cluster of virus proteomes that waS
consistent with virus or host taxonomy. We provide BLASTP search and FTP download of Viral RP
protein sequences, and a browser to facilitate the visualization of Viral RPS.

1 Introduction

There are existing methods for reducing protein sequence space.
NCBI-nr (NCBI Resource Coordinators, 2015 ) clusters identical pro-
teins, while UniRefs (Suzek et (11., 2015) provide clustered protein se-
quences at multiple similarity levels. NCBI-RefSeq (Tatusova et (11.,
2015) and UniProt’s Reference Proteomes (The UniProt Consortium,
2015) provide users with the ability to perform analyses or create pro-
tein families using a limited set of complete proteomes selected
by curators. However, such approaches are difficult to scale up and do
not show the relationships between organisms.

Previously, we created Representative Proteomes (RPs) (Chen
et (11., 2011) by clustering Archaea, Bacteria and Eukaryota prote-
omes into related groups and selecting a representative organism
from each group. Compared to UniRefs clustering, which is based
on the similarity of individual proteins, RPs clustering is based on
the similarity of whole proteomes. These computationally deter-
mined RPs are now included in the UniProt Reference Proteome set
(The UniProt Consortium, 2015). However, viral proteomes posed
special challenges, as the taxonomy for viruses is not uniformly
defined; potentially there are taxonomic nomenclature variations

resulting from naming more distantly related viruses as if they were
the same genus or by naming closely related viruses as if they were
in different taxonomic cladeS. To address those challenges we cluS—
tered viruS proteomes based on the similarity of their overall protein
sequences in a proteome scale using algorithms that can reliably and
quickly calculate a hierarchical set of Viral Reference Proteomes
(Viral RPS) at different co—membership cut—offs. Specifically, the
clustering of the viruS proteomes starts at very high similarity level
in order to identify the proteomes that are very similar to other
proteomes or proteomes that are an identical subset of other prote—
omes (sub—proteomes). In addition, we incorporate the UniProtKB
annotation score (http://www.uniprot.org/help/annotation_score)
(The UniProt Consortium, 2015 ) into our Proteome Priority Score
(PPS) (Chen et al., 2011).

2 Methods

Viral RPS are updated monthly using UniProtKB complete prote—
omes and UniRef50. Each proteome used in the calculation is ren—
dered approximately ‘one entry per gene”. We take all SwiSS—Prot
entries for a given gene in each proteome, sort the TrEMBL entries
by sequence length and retain only the entry with the longest se—
quence for any gene not already represented by a SwiSS—Prot entry.
The procedure to generate Viral RPS includes: (i) Compute pair—wise
co—membership for all Virus proteomes. (ii) Cluster Virus proteomes
into Representative Proteome Groups (RPGS). (iii) Select Reference
proteomes from each RPG.

2.1 Co—membership of two proteomes
The relatedness of two proteomes iS measured by their co—member—
ship (X) in UniRef5 0 clusters and iS defined aS:

2 100 N .
X : Wkut-oﬁs < 90%); otherw1se,
X :M7 N4 < Nb
Na

where Na is the number of UniRef5 0 clusters containing a protein
from proteome A. N), iS the number of UniRef50 clusters containing
a protein from proteome B. Na), iS the number of UniRef5 0 clusters
containing a protein from both proteomes A and B. Given a co—
membership cut—off (CMC), if X 2 CMC, two proteomes are
grouped together.

2.2 Representative proteome group (RPG)

The co—membership (X) of each pair of proteomes iS calculated
for all viruS complete proteomes. The mean co—membership for a
proteome iS the average X value between a proteome and all other
proteomes. RPGS are constructed aS follows: (i) proteomes are
ranked according to their average X values. (ii) The top proteome

Table 1. Summary statistics of Viral RPGS

iS taken aS the seed for a new RPG. For the reSt of the proteomes
in the ranked list, if X 2 CMC with the seed, they are added
to the newly formed group and then removed from the ranked
liSt. (iii) Re—calculate mean co—membership for the proteomes in the
liSt. (iv) Repeat Steps i, ii and iii. (v) Annotate the viruS proteomes in
each RPG with their taxonomic group and host information derived
from UniProtKB and NCBI Genome databases.

RPGS were calculated for five CMC cut—off levels (95, 75, 55, 35
and 15 %) hierarchically using a top—down approach to ensure the
proteomes grouped together Stay together even at a lower CMC.

2.3 Select representative from RPG

Proteomes in each RPG are scored to facilitate representative selec—
tion for the group based on: (i) number of unique PubMed refer—
ences listed in the UniProtKB entries in the proteome, excluding
large—scale analysis (PMID). (ii) Mean UniProt Annotation Score of
UniProtKB protein entries in the proteome (MeanAS). (iii) Number
of UniProtKB protein entries in the proteome (Entry). The UniProt
reference proteome (RefP) and the previously released representative
proteome (PRP) are given higher weights for Stability. The Proteome
Priority Score (PPS) for representative selection iS calculated aS fol—
lows: PPS = 10000 X (RefP) + 8000 >< (PRP) + 1000 >< (PMID) +
100 X (MeanAS) + 1 X (Entry).

3 Results and discussions

One objective in producing a Viral RP set iS to reduce the protein se—
quence Space while preserving both sequence representation and an—
notation. Table 1 Shows that low CMCS tend to greatly reduce
sequence Space at the cost of producing RPGS that may contain mul—
tiple genera in one RPG. High CMCS have a low sequence Space re—
duction, and are more likely to Split Species from a given genus into
multiple RPGS. Nonetheless, even at 95% CMC, only ~5% viruS
proteomes from the same Species are Split among multiple RPGS.
Close examination reveals that a majority of these are bacterio—
phageS, where enormous diversity exiStS even within those found in
the same bacterial host (Grose and Casjens, 2014). As expected, at
all cut—offs the taxonomic consistency of RPGS rises with taxonomic
rank; that iS, successively fewer RPGS contain viruses from multiple
taxa aS one traverses from Species (not Shown) to genus to family.
This iS also observed aS one traverses the taxonomic ranks of viruS
hosts (Supplementary Fig. 51). The algorithmically selected viral
RPS are mostly consistent with the ones selected manually by
UniProt curators (Supplementary Table 52).

We developed a web Site to disseminate Viral RPS and related
data. Users can download pre—selected Viral RP sequences or custom
build sequence files with respect to taxonomic groups and CMCS.
We developed a Viral RPS browser that Shows the proteomes at dif—
ferent co—membership cut—offs and provides taxonomic and host

information. A BLASTP search iS provided against Viral RP
sequences.

A Standard set of Viral RPS Should facilitate functional annota—
tion by decreasing the redundancy of Similarity search results,
thereby aiding the identification of homologs, protein family classifi—
cation and comparative genomic and proteomic analyses. RPGS can
also be used to identify errors in proteome annotations. For
example, identical Species are expected to be in the same cluster at
95 %. When they are not it iS often due to an annotation error.

Taxonomic assignment among viruses iS usually derived from
phylogenetic analyses. Nonetheless, grouping on the baSiS of
Shared proteome features has been suggested aS a more accurate
view of viral relatedness for phages because of their high recom—
bination rate (Lima-Mendez et al., 2007; Rohwer and Edwards,
2002). By taking advantage of the tunable CMC resolution, viral
RPGS have the potential to serve aS a tool not just for grouping
viruses into broad categories, but also for differentiating closely
related Strains.

The inability to discern a viruS’ host range from its genome
sequence has also represented a Significant problem in interpretation of
viral metagenomic data. The host range of viruses observed in RPGS
with high CMC tends to be quite narrow, with about 96% of RPG95S
Sharing a Species—level host among all members, while the same viruses
will often occur in RPGS with broadening host ranges at successive
higher CMC (Supplementary Fig. 51). By exploiting this trend,
the known host range within a given RPG may be used to provide clues
toward the host range of unknown viruses in the same group.

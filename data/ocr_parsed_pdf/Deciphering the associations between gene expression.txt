Abstract

Motivation: Both gene expression levels (GEs) and copy number alterations (CNAs) have import—
ant biological implications. GEs are partly regulated by CNAs, and much effort has been devoted
to understanding their relations. The regulation analysis is challenging with one gene expression
possibly regulated by multiple CNAs and one CNA potentially regulating the expressions of mul—
tiple genes. The correlations among GEs and among CNAs make the analysis even more compli—
cated. The existing methods have limitations and cannot comprehensively describe the
regulation.

Results: A sparse double Laplacian shrinkage method is developed. It jointly models the effects of
multiple CNAs on multiple GEs. Penalization is adopted to achieve sparsity and identify the regula—
tion relationships. Network adjacency is computed to describe the interconnections among GEs
and among CNAs. Two Laplacian shrinkage penalties are imposed to accommodate the network
adjacency measures. Simulation shows that the proposed method outperforms the competing al—
ternatives with more accurate marker identification. The Cancer Genome Atlas data are analysed
to further demonstrate advantages of the proposed method.

Both gene expression levels (GEs) and copy number alterations

(CNAs) have important biological implications. GEs are partly regu—
lated by CNAs (Henrichsen et (11., 2009). In the recent multidimen—
sional studies, GE and CNA measurements have been collected on

eral, a CNA is positively associated with the expression level of its
corresponding gene. Multiple studies have conducted bivariate
analysis and focused on the dependence between a GE and its cor—
responding CNA. For example, Schafer et al. (2009) proposed a
procedure based on a modified correlation coefficient to search for
driver genes of which both GEs and CNAs display strong equally
directed abnormalities. Salari et al. (2010) conducted supervised

the same subjects, making it possible to study their regulation rela—
tionships (Shih et (11., 2011; Wrzeszczynski et (11., 2011; Wynes
et (11., 2014).

analysis and identified genes with significant GE—CNA correl—
ations. Such ‘one GE against one CNA’ analysis has limitations.
The expression level of one gene can be affected by multiple
CNAs, and a CNA can induce altered expression levels of genes
from unlinked regions (Stranger et al., 2007). Thus, if we consider
a regression framework, it should be multiple GEs against multiple
CNAs. As we need to search for the regulation relationships among
a large number of GEs and CNAs, with the often low sample sizes,
regularized estimation and marker selection are needed. The ana—
lysis gets more complicated with correlations among GEs and
among CNAs. Specifically, high correlations among CNAs have
been observed in both coding and non—coding regions (Stamoulis,
2011). Co—regulated genes can have highly correlated expression
levels. Recent studies under simpler settings have shown that ac—
counting for correlations is critical for analysing genetic data
(Huang et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013). A few studies have addressed
the correlations among measurements. For example, Kim et al.
(2009) developed the graph—guided fused Lasso method to address
the dependency structure among responses. Peng et al. (2010) pro—
posed the remMap method to identify master CNAs which affect
most GEs. A common limitation of these studies is that correlation
is only accounted for in one side of the regression model, and hence
the analysis is not ‘complete’. In addition, ineffective estimation
approaches have been adopted.

The goal of this study is to more effectively analyse GE and
CNA data so as to better understand their relationships. To ac—
count for the fact that multiple CNAs can affect the expression
level of a gene, we simultaneously model the joint effects of mul—
tiple CNAs. For the identification of important CNAs associated
with a GE, an effective penalization approach is adopted. The
most significant advancement is that networks are adopted to de—
scribe the correlations among GEs and among CNAs. When the
correlations among GEs are taken into consideration, the analysis
becomes a ‘multiple GEs against multiple CNAs’ regression
problem. That is, both the responses and predictors are high—
dimensional. To accommodate the network structures, we propose
a sparse double Laplacian shrinkage (SDLS) approach, which com—
bines the power of penalized variable selection and Laplacian
shrinkage. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to
effectively accommodate correlations in both sides of the GE-CNA
regression. It is noted that although our analysis focuses on GEs
and CNAs, the proposed method is potentially applicable to other
types of genetic measurements.

2 Data and model settings

Consider a dataset with n iid samples, each with m GE and p CNA
measurements. Let Y : (yl, . . . ,y'") be the n X m matrix of GEs and
X : (X1,...,Xp) be the n ><p matrix of CNAs. We first process
data so that the GEs are centered and the CNAs are centered and
standardized with  : n, j : 1, . . . ,1). Although it is possible
that CNAs regulate GEs in a non—linear way, non—linear modeling
incurs prohibitively high computational cost, and the dominating
majority of existing studies have focused on linear modeling.
Consider the multivariate regression model

yk:X/ik+sk, I221....,m. (1)

where eks are the error terms, and [3" : (ﬁ’f, . . . Jig) T is the regres—
sion coefficient vector associated with the lath gene. The p ><m
regression coefficient matrix is l)’ : ([31, . . . ,ﬁ'") : ([31, . . . J?!) T .

The expression level of a gene is regulated by at most a few CNAs,
and one CNA affects at most a few GE levels. Thus, I} is sparse.

2.1 Penalized identification
Under the sparsity condition, we use penalization for estimation and
identification of important associations. Consider the estimate

ii: argmin{32mj  (y? — X? W + 13mm}, (2)
[I n k:1 i:1

where  is the penalty function, and Ly are parameters that de—
fine the penalty. A non—zero component of [3’ indicates an association
between the corresponding CNA and GE. For the penalty function,
first consider the MCP (minimax concave penalization; Zhang,
2010), where the penalty

m P

Po(l)’;/11H/)= Z whim). (3)

13:1 i:1

with p(t; A, y) : My (1 — ﬁhdx. A is the tuning parameter, and v is
the regularization parameter. The MCP has been shown to have per—
formance comparable to or better than many other penalties includ—
ing Lasso, adaptive Lasso and SCAD (Breheny and Huang, 2011;
Zhang, 2010). It conducts marker selection and regularized estima—
tion but does not have a ‘built—in’ mechanism to accommodate cor—
relations. Note that imposing P0 is equivalent to analysing each GE
separately but with the same tuning parameter for all GEs to ensure
comparability.

3 Sparse double Laplacian shrinkage

3.1 Construction of network adjacency measures

GEs (CNAs) are ‘connected’ to each other. In this study, we adopt a
network approach to describe the interconnections among GEs and
among CNAs. In a network, a node corresponds to a GE or a CNA.
A network contains rich information. Of special importance to this
study is the adjacency, which is one of the most important network
measures and quantifies how ‘closely’ two nodes are connected to
each other (Zhang et al., 2005).

Denote r,-,- as the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between
nodes i and /. Other similarity measures such as the Spearman’s
correlation can also be used. Based on r,-,-, Zhang et al. (2005) pro—
posed several ways of constructing the adjacency matrix, whose
(i, /)th element is a,-,-, the adjacency between nodes i and /. Notable
examples include (i) a,-,- : sgn(r,-,-)I{Ir,-,-I > r}, where r is the cutoff
calculated from the Fisher transformation (Huang et al., 2011);
 a,-,- I i’il'1{j1’i,'j > 1’};  a,-,- I 7?;1{j1’i,'j > 1’}, and  a,-,- I 73-. In
(iii) and (iv), or is determined using the scale—free topology criterion
(Zhang et al., 2005). We acknowledge that other approaches, for
example the Gaussian graphical model (Yuan et al., 2007), can
also be used to construct the adjacency matrix. As our goal is to
demonstrate the incorporation of adjacency not to compare differ—
ent constructions of adjacency, we focus on (iii) with «:5.
Compared with the Gaussian graphical model and others, this con—
struction has ignorable computational cost. The resulted adjacency
matrix is sparse and easy to manipulate. 06 :5 ensures that a,-,- has
the same sign as r,-,-. Note that it is straightforward to implement
other adjacency measures.

We compute the adjacency measures for GEs and CNAs in the
same manner. Denote A : (a,-,-, 1 S 13/31:) and B : (bk), 1 3 [2,13 m)
as the adjacency matrices for CNAs and GEs respectively.

3.2 Penalized estimation and identification
Consider the penalized estimation framework specified in (2). We
propose the SDLS penalty

A : (21,22, 23) is the vector of tuning parameters. sgn(-) is the sign
function.

This penalty has been motivated by the following consider—
ations. Po(-) conducts selection using MCP, as described in
Section 2.1. Two Laplacian type penalties (Liu et al., 2013)
are introduced. Consider for example CNAs. If two CNAs are not
connected with a,-,- : 0, then the Laplacian penalty is equal to zero.
If two CNAs have a large positive a,-,-, then they are tightly con—
nected and have highly correlated measurements. The Laplacian
penalty encourages their regression coefficients to be similar, with
the degree of similarity adjusted by the degree of adjacency Iaiil.
If two CNAs have a large negative a,-,-, then the Laplacian penalty
has a form similar to ridge penalty, which conducts regularized es—
timation and shrinks the magnitudes of both regression coeffi—
cients. Similar rationale holds for GEs. If two GEs are tightly
connected in a network, then their regression coefficient profiles
should be similar. The first Laplacian penalty corresponds to the
rows of the coefficient matrix, and the second corresponds to the
columns. Each element of the coefficient matrix is possibly
included in multiple penalties. A is adjusted data—dependently to
avoid over—shrinkage.

The two Laplacian penalties take quadratic forms and can be
associated with the Laplacians for undirected weighted graphs. Take
the first Laplacian penalty as an example. Let D : diag(d1, . . . ,dp),
where d,- : 2L1 lag-I. We can rewrite

Z Z IaiiII/If‘5gn(aii)ﬁflz:tr(ﬁTL/I)a (5)

13:1 1£i<iSP

where L : D — A. The matrix L is associated with a labeled
weighted graph g : (V, 5) with the vertex set V : {1, . . . ,p} and
edge set 5 : {(j,k) : (ﬁle) 6 V X V}. It has been referred to as the
Laplacian of g (Chung, 1997).

3.3 Computation
With the introduction of two Laplacian penalties, the existing algo—
rithms are not directly applicable. We propose a two—layer coordin—
ate descent (CD) algorithm. It optimizes with respect to one element
of l)’ at a time and cycles through all elements. Iterations are repeated
until convergence. In this algorithm, the key is the update with re—
spect to each element.

Consider the overall objective function defined in (2). For
k : 1, . . . ,m and j : 1, . . . ,1), given the parameters [if (/ ye i) fixed
at their current estimates, we seek to minimize the penalized object—
ive function with respect to ﬁf. Here only terms involving [3? matter.

In the penalized objective function, the least squares loss function
and two Laplacian penalties have quadratic forms. P0 is the sum of
mp terms, with one for each component of [3. Following Breheny and
Huang (2011), the CD algorithm converges to the coordinate—wise
minimum, which is also a stationary point. In our numerical study,
convergence is achieved for all simulated and real data.

The SDLS method involves three tuning parameters 21,22,23
and regularization parameter v. For y, Breheny and Huang (2011)
and Zhang (2010) suggest examining a small number of values (for
example, 1.8, 3, 6 and 10) or fixing its value. In our numeric study,
we find that the results are not sensitive to v and set v : 6. In prac—
tice, one may need to experiment with multiple v values, examine
the sensitivity of estimates and select using data—dependent methods.
The values of A play a more important role. 21 controls the sparsity
of marker selection. 22 and 23 control the smoothness among coeffi—
cients. To reduce computational cost, one may set 22 : l3, imposing
the same degree of shrinkage for CNAs and GEs. However, as the
overall computational cost is affordable, we jointly search for the

optimal A1, 22 and 23 values using V—fold cross validation (V25).
For 21, we start with the smallest value under which all regression
coefficients are zero. We then gradually reduce 21 over a discrete
grid of values. For 22 and 23, our experience suggests that the esti—
mates can be relatively less sensitive to their values. We search over
the discrete grid of 10“"_2’_1’0’1’2"“.

4 Simulation

To mimic GE and CNA data in a pathway, we consider the scenario
with (m, p) : (200200). The proposed method is applicable to
whole—genome data with a higher dimension. However, since the
main objective is to accommodate interconnections among GEs and
CNAs, it is reasonable to focus on a pathway, as genes within the
same pathway are more likely to be co—regulated and have correlated
measurements while genes in different pathways tend to be function—
ally and statistically uncorrelated. In the next section, we analyse The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. In Supplementary Figure 3, we
show the histograms of processed CNA values for two randomly
chosen genes. Motivated by Figure 3, we simulate CNAs as a mixture
of two normal distributions, one with a small and the other with a
large variance. Both distributions have mean zero. For each normal
distribution, we consider two correlation structures: (i) the block
structure. CNAs belong to clusters. Those in different clusters are in—
dependent, while those in the same cluster have correlation coefficient
p1; and (ii) the auto—regressive (AR) structure. CNAs i and / within
the same cluster have correlation coefficient pI1‘ _‘ I. For both structures,
there are 40 clusters, with 5 CNAs per cluster. CNA measurements
take discrete values, and for whole—genome data, they often have a
block—wise constant structure. The simulated data have a continuous
distribution, which has been motivated by the processed TCGA data
(Supplementary Figure 3). In addition, the block—wise constant struc—
ture is not obvious when we focus on a pathway, as genes within the
same pathway are not necessarily physically nearby.

We generate the sparse coefficient matrix I} as having a block di—
agonal structure

W1>I<K1 0 0
0 W2>I<K2 0

0 0

where >l< denotes the element—wise product. W, and K, have dimen—
sion 5 X 5 for t : 1, . . . ,40. K, has entries with independent
Bernoulli draws with a success probability of 0.8. W, is the effect
size matrix with each entry independently drawn from a uniform
distribution. Consider the following two examples.

Example 1: For t3 10, entries of odd columns in W, are from
Unif(0.8,1), and those of even columns are from Unif(—1,—0.8).
For 11 S t£20, entries of odd columns in W, are from
Unif(—1,—0.8), and those of even columns are from Unif(0.8,1).
Entries in W, are equal to 0 for t>20. This example stresses the
similarity among certain rows.

Example 2: For t g 10, entries of odd rows in W, are from
Unif(0.8,1), and those of even rows are from Unif(—1,—0.8). For
11 S t S 20, entries of odd rows in W, are from Unif(—1,—0.8), and
those of even rows are from Unif(0.8,1). For t> 20, W, are equal
to 0. This example stresses the similarity among certain columns.

For both examples, we expect that there are a total of
20 >l< 5 >l< 5 >l< 0.8 : 400 true positives (20 clusters; 5 >i< 5 elements per
cluster; and 0.8 probability of being non—zero for each element).

The random errors are generated independently from
N(0, 0.52 >l< AR(p2)), reﬂecting the fact that GEs are also regulated
by other mechanisms, for example methylation, which can lead to
further correlation. The GE values are generated from the linear re—
gression model (1). In addition, to examine whether performance of
the proposed method depends on the number of true positives, we
also simulate two examples with 40 true positives.

We analyse the simulated data using the SDLS method (which is
also referred to as PGC, with Laplacian penalties on both ‘G’ and ‘C’).
In addition, we also consider (i) a marginal approach. This approach
conducts the regression of one GE on one CNA. The P—values from
all pairs are pooled, and then an FDR (false discovery rate; Benjamini
and Yekutieli (2001)) approach with target FDR: 0.05 is applied to
identify important associations. (ii) P0, which is the proposed method
with A; : A3 : 0. (iii) PC, which is the proposed method with A3 : 0.
It accommodates the network structure and so correlations among
CNAs but not GEs. And (iv) PC, which is the proposed method with
22 : 0. It accommodates the network structure and so correlations
among GEs but not CNAs. We acknowledge that multiple methods
can be used to analyse the simulated data. The first approach con—
ducts the popular ‘one GE against one CNA’ analysis, and the last
three have a penalization framework closest to the proposed and can
establish the value of accounting for correlations among both GEs
and CNAs in the most direct way.

The identification performance is evaluated using the number of
true positives (TP) and false positives (FP). In addition, we also
measure prediction performance using the model error (ME), which
is defined as ME(/3,/)’) : tr[(/3 — [if 2([3 —  Note that the mar—
ginal approach does not generate model errors.

Simulation suggests the proposed method is computationally af—
fordable. For example, for one data replicate under Example 1, PGC
takes 445.3 seconds on a regular desktop. In comparison, P0, PC and
PG take 50.0, 116.5 and 194.9 s, respectively. Summary statistics for
Example 1 and 2 with 400 expected true positives are shown in
Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Those with 40 expected true positives
are shown in Supplementary Tables S4 and S5, respectively.
Simulation suggests that the marginal approach is in general infer—
ior. With weak correlations, it identifies fewer true positives. When
there are strong correlations, it can have satisfactory performance in
terms of true positives, however, at the price of a huge number of
false positives. We have experimented with adjusting the target FDR
value so that the number of true positives is comparable to that of
the proposed method and found that the marginal approach has sig—
nificantly more false positives (results omitted). For the penalization
methods, when CNAs and GEs are only weakly correlated, perform—
ance of different methods is similar. For example, in Table 1 with
the AR correlation structure and (p1,p2) : (0.1, 0.1), the four pen—
alization methods identify 385.6 (P0), 385.5 (PC), 388.2 (PG) and
388.3 (PGC) true positives, with 26.4, 25.9, 23.7 and 24.2 false posi—
tives, respectively. In addition, the prediction performance is also
similar. However, when there exist moderate to strong correlations,
the advantage of proposed method becomes obvious. For example
in Table 1 with the AR correlation structure and
(p1,p2) : (0.5, 0.1), P0 identifies 384.2 true positives, whereas PCG
identifies 396.9 true positives, at the price of a few more false posi—
tives. When (p1,p2) : (0.9, 0.9), P0 only identifies 148.8 true posi—
tives, in comparison to 335.3 of FCC. In addition, PGC also has
better prediction performance with ME equal to 8.00, compared to
38.13 of P0. The block correlation structure and Table 2 show simi—
lar patterns. Supplementary Tables S4 and S5 suggest that the pro—
posed method also has superior performance when there are 40
expected true positives.

In each cell, the three rows are model error, number of true positives and number of false positives. The marginal approach does not generate model errors.

Mean (standard deviation).

The inferior performance of the marginal approach is as ex—
pected, as a GE is jointly affected by multiple CNAs while the mar—
ginal approach analyses only one CNA at a time. It is interesting to
note that the proposed PGC outperforms or is comparable to P0
across the whole spectrum of simulation with different correlation
structures. Thus it can be ‘safe’ to use it in practice when the true
correlation structure is unknown. With weak correlations, FCC and
P0 perform similarly. PGC targets taking advantage of the intercon—
nections among CNAs and GEs. When such interconnections are
weak or do not exist, PGC cannot improve much over P0. It is also
observed that after accounting for the network structure of CNAs,
accounting for that of GEs leads to small improvement. This is also
reasonable as in the simulated data, the interconnections among
GEs are largely caused by those among CNAs. However, as we do

observe moderate improvement of FCC over PC under multiple scen—
arios, it is sensible to account for both networks. PGC may lead to a
few more false positives, as the newly added Laplacian penalties
have a squared form, are dense penalties, and tend to ‘pull’ zero co—
efficients towards correlated important ones. In the simulated ex—
amples, the block sizes are equal. We have also experimented with
unequal sizes and found comparable results (details omitted).

5 Data analysis

We first analyse the TCGA (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) data on
glioblastoma (GBM). GE and CNA measurements are available on
479 patients. We download and analyse the processed level 3 data.
The GE measurements were originally generated using the custom

Agilent 244K array platforms. The analysed data are the robust
Z—scores, which are lowess—normalized, log—transformed, and me—
dian—centered version of gene expression data that take into ac—
count all of the gene expression arrays under consideration. The
measurement determines whether a gene is up— or down—regulated
relative to the reference population. The CNA measurements were
originally generated using the Affymetrix SNP6.0 platforms. The
loss and gain levels of copy number changes have been identified
using the segmentation analysis and GISTIC algorithm and ex—
pressed in the form of log2 ratio of a sample versus the reference
intensity. We analyse the apoptosis pathway. The set of genes is
identified from Gene Ontology (GO) using the annotation package
in GSEA (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea). Apoptosis is a
regulated cellular suicide mechanism by which cells undergo death
to control cell proliferation or in response to DNA damage. The
apoptosis pathway is a hallmark of cancer (Khanna and Jackson,
2001). For the GBM data, there are 298 GEs and 338 CNAs in this
pathway.

Figure 1 contains the heatmaps of the correlation coefficient
matrices for both CNAs and GEs, after reordering the variables
based on the hierarchical clustering so that highly correlated
CNAs and GEs are clustered with block structures along the diag—
onal. The two plots show several blocks representing densely con—
nected subgraphs for CNAs and GEs. The subgraphs for CNAs are
further shown in Figure 2.

Beyond the marginal and four penalization methods as described
in simulation, we also consider Pm", which regresses one GE on all
CNAs at a time and applies penalized selection. For all penalization
methods, the tuning parameters are selected using V—fold cross valid—
ation. For the 298 X 338 regression coefficient matrix I}, 2747 (mar—
ginal), 3022 (Pm), 2662 (PGC), 1736 (P0), 2206 (PC) and 1917 (PG)
non—zero elements are identified. Different methods identify different
sets of associations. For example, there are only 104 overlaps between
the marginal approach and FCC. For PGC and P0, we show in Figure 1
the positions of non—zero regression coefficients (represented by red
pixels). The rows and columns have been rearranged corresponding
to the upper panels of Figure 1. Corresponding results under Pum- are
provided in Supplementary Appendix. More details on the other
methods are available from the authors. PGC identifies more non—zero
elements than P0, PC and PC, which is in line with the observations
made in simulation. When more closely examining the identified
CNAs, we find that several critical genes, including IFNB1, HIPK3,
CASP3, TIAL1, MAP3K10, VEGFA and CDKN2A, have been associ—
ated with quite a few GEs. PGC employs Laplacian penalties, which
encourage the similarity of regression coefficients. We evaluate the
similarity of columns of the regression coefficient matrix. We sum
over the off—diagonal elements in the correlation matrices of regres—
sion coefficients, and obtain 399.2 for PGC, 357.7 for P0 and 177.5
for Pm", which suggests a higher level of similarity for PGC.

As a representative example, we also take a closer look at the
PTEN gene. PTEN acts as a tumor suppressor through the action of
its phosphatase protein product. This phosphatase is involved in the
regulation of cell cycle, preventing cells from growing and dividing
too rapidly. The identified CNAs and their estimated regression co—
efficients are shown in Table 3. Under the five penalization methods,
CNA PTEN has positive regression coefficients, and their magni—
tudes are the largest. However, the marginal approach misses this
CNA. PGC identifies the most CNAs. Our analysis suggests that the
expression of PTEN is associated with not only its corresponding
CNA but also a few others. In Figure 2, we also show the CNAs
identified using different methods with respect to the subgraphs. For
PGC, five subgraphs contain at least two identified CNAs. In con—
trast, P0 identifies one such subgraph, and Pum- identifies none
(Supplementary Appendix).

The apoptosis pathway is cancer related. In Supplementary
Appendix, we also conduct two additional analyses which may serve
as ‘negative controls’. In the first set of analysis, we analyse the cellu—
lar localization pathway in the GBM data. The cellular localization
pathway is biologically important. However, there is no evidence that
it is associated with GBM or other cancers. In the second set of ana—
lysis, we analyse the gluconeogenesis pathway in the TCGA LIHC
(liver hepatocellular carcinoma) data. The biological process regu—
lated by this pathway is specific to liver and kidney in mammals.
Detailed results are presented in Supplementary Appendix. The over—
all conclusions are similar to those drawn for the apoptosis pathway.

In our analyses, we focus on specific pathways, with the expect—
ation that different pathways have different biological functions. Some
genes belong to multiple pathways. For such genes, analysing them in
different pathways will lead to different sets of identified CNAs. One
way to solve this problem is to expand the proposed analysis to mul—
tiple pathways, which may lead to increased computational cost.

6 Discussion

Multiple types of genetic, epigenetic, and genomic changes can hap—
pen on the human genome. It is important to understand their rela—
tionships. Using GE and CNA as an example, we have developed a

For the marginal approach, a ‘+’ represents an identiﬁed association.

SDLS method. This method uses effective penalization for marker
selection and regularized estimation. Significantly advancing from
the existing studies, it adopts two Laplacian penalties to accommo—
date the interconnections among GEs and among CNAs. It has an
intuitive formulation and can be realized using an efficient CD algo—
rithm. Simulations show that it has comparable performance as the
alternatives when there are only weak correlations among GEs and
CNAs. However with moderate to strong correlations, as has been
commonly observed in practical data, it has significantly better iden—
tification and prediction performance. In data analyses, it identifies
associations different from those using the alternatives. The esti—
mated regression coefficient matrix has a higher level of row and
column similarity. Manually examining the analysis results for a few
representative genes suggests reasonable analysis results.

To better accommodate finer data structures, the proposed
method introduces new penalties with new tunings. The computa—
tional cost is thus higher than the alternatives, which is the price
paid for better modeling data. However, as the Laplacian penalties
are differentiable, the computational complexity is acceptable. To
reduce computational cost, one may set 22 : 23, resulting in only
two tunings. Our numerical experience suggests that three tuning
parameters are also acceptable. As the main objective is to develop
the new method, we have adopted only one adjacency measure. We
acknowledge that there may exist other perhaps better adjacency
measures. However, it is not our goal to compare and draw conclu—
sions on the relative performance of different adjacency measures.
Under multiple simulation settings, the proposed method has been
shown to be superior. More extensive simulations may be conducted

in the future. In data analyses, the proposed method identifies asso—
ciations different from the alternatives. Simple examinations suggest
that the results are reasonable. More extensive analyses are needed
to fully validate the findings.

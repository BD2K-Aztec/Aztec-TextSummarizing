ABSTRACT

Summary: Analysis of high throughput metabolomics experiments
is a resource-intensive process that includes pre-processing, pre-
treatment and post-processing at each level of experimental
hierarchy. We developed an interactive user-friendly online software
called Metabolite Data Analysis Tool (MetDAT) for mass spectrometry
data. It offers a pipeline of tools for file handling, data pre-processing,
univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, database searching
and pathway mapping. Outputs are produced in the form of text and
high-quality images in real-time. MetDAT allows users to combine
data management and experiment-centric workflows for optimization
of metabolomics methods and metabolite analysis.

Availability: MetDAT is available free for academic use from http://
smbl.nus.edu.sg/METDAT2/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolomics experiments conducted using mass spectrometry
produce spectral outputs amounting to gigabytes of data. This is
a result of elaborate experimental set-ups with several replicates,
time-series studies and different types of treatment parameters
for a single sample. Datasets from such experimental set-up can
be very complex. Querying information from several subsets of
complex datasets and deriving meaningful biological interpretation
is very Challenging. To overcome this problem in data handling and
analysis, the metabolomics research community has recommended
a minimal set of reporting standards and general guidelines for data
analysis, interpretation and exchange of metabolomics experiments
(Fiehn et (11., 2008; Goodacre et al., 2007; Sansone et (11., 2007).
Data pre-processing generally involves removal of noise and
reduction of baseline of the raw data. The resulting data are
normalized and sealed for univariate and multivariate statistical
analysis. Visualization of the resultant output helps to understand and
interpret experimental results. A number of standalone data analysis
tools for preprocessing, statistical analysis and pathway mapping
(szine, XCMS, MassTrix, Metexplore, Bioconductor) are freely
available on the web (Jourdan et al., 2010; Katajamaa et (11., 2007;
Lommen, 2009). Currently, these available data analysis tools do

not have the means to include information from experiment such
as hierarchical data structure. As a result, meaningful inferences
based on comparisons at the various levels of data structure are not
straightforward and their associated effects are not easily interpreted.
Most of the available tools require continuous interaction with
users in the programs leading to delayed output. Here, we present
Metabolite Data Analysis Tool (MetDAT) to address gaps in the
currently available software for mass spectrometry data analysis
in a systems-centric approach. MetDAT is a web-based tool with
an open and integrated system that performs data preprocessing,
analysis followed by database searches with ﬁlters to reﬁne the
output. MetDAT also provides interactive and customizable modules
and user-driven analysis of data at hierarchical levels.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Computational model and user interface

MetDAT is a platform-independent web application, which works well
with most widely used web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox (above 3.2),
Internet Explorer (above 6), Google Chrome and Safari. The web interface
of MetDAT is developed using HTML and CGI-Perl scripts. Computational
functions of MetDAT are written in Perl and R languages, while graphics
are generated using Gnuplot (Williams at al., 1993) and R packages (R
Development Core Team, 2008). The software is hosted on a server running
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.4.

MetDAT accepts input data as tab-delimited text ﬁles in a single zipped
ﬁle which is then converted into a matrix by ‘Prepare Dataset’ module.
The standalone modules run seamlessly on uploaded data and show the
results instantaneously but these results are not saved on MetDAT’s server.
All MetDAT programs can be used without any log-in. However, logged-
in users have the beneﬁt of creating custom workﬂows or using a default
one. The workﬂows are designed such that the data can be cleaned up,
analyzed, Visualized and interpreted all in one smooth pipeline. Two default
workﬂowsione for differential metabolite analysis and another for method
optimization are provided in MetDAT. The uploaded datasets, workﬂows and
results are automatically stored on MetDAT server and can be retrieved at a
later time.

MetDAT has no restrictions on the number of ﬁles to be processed.
However, larger datasets would require longer processing time. This software
has a combination of 23 most commonly used programs by metabolomics
researchers for pre-processing, pre-treatment, data analysis, visualization,
metabolite database search and pathway mapping. Other programs like self
organizing map, Random forest and support vector machine are not available
in this version of the software. These programs have been streamlined such
that they can be used readily by beginners while providing ample controls

for customization by advanced users. User interface provides a dashboard for
easy access to the programs and results (Fig. l). A standalone visualization
module that is accessible from the dashboard has two types of interactive
plotsiXiY plot and barchart. These require Adobe Flash plug-in to be
installed in the browser. Algorithms for programs, references, user guide
and examples are included in the manual at the website for easy reference.

2.2 Data processing, analysis and output

The pre-processing and pre-treatment modules in MetDAT include removing
noise, correction of base lines and normalizing or scaling the data to increase
signal-to-noise ratio. Data analysis includes a range of statistical techniques
such as analysis of variance, principal component analysis, partial least
square (PLS), partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), linear
discriminant analysis and t-test. The major strength of this software is
the power to analyze data at various hierarchical levels such as samples,
treatments, time points, biological repeats and technical replicates. Datasets
for the different hierarchical levels can be assigned at data preparation.
It provides users the option to perform intensive statistical analysis at any
of these levels. Differentially expressed metabolites are listed based on fold
change and t-test analysis. The listed metabolites can further be searched
against four databasesiAracyc (Mueller et al., 2003), HMDB (Wishart
et al., 2009), Plantcyc and KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) along with

multiple ﬁlters for better and targeted results. The database search includes
a feature for metabolic pathway identiﬁcation. Key differential metabolites
are highlighted for users to focus on selected parts of metabolic networks.

3 CONCLUSIONS

Metabolic perturbation studies involve understanding effects of
variation in a statistically robust fashion. This software is created
with the vision of biologists for data analysis and interpretation.
MetDAT platform simpliﬁes and standardizes data analysis for
usage with minimal training. MetDAT provides data processing
and analysis, database search for metabolite identiﬁcation, pathway
mapping and a rich palette of visualization tools. The combination of
data management and customizable workﬂow makes data analysis
faster thereby saving researchers time.

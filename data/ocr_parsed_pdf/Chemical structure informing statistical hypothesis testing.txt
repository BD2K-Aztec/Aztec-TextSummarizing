ABSTRACT

Motivation: Metabolomics has been shown as an effective tool to
study various biological and biomedical phenotypes, whereas interro-
gating the inherently noisy metabolite concentration data with limited
sample size remains a major challenge. Accumulating evidence sug-
gests that metabolites’ structures are relevant to their bioactivities.
Results: We present a new strategy to boost the statistical power of
hypothesis testing in metabolomics by incorporating quantitative mo-
lecular descriptors for each metabolite. The strategy selects potentially
informative summary molecular descriptors and outputs chemical
structure-informed false discovery rates. The effectiveness of the pro-
posed strategy is demonstrated by both simulation studies and a real
application. In a metabolomic study on Alzheimer’s disease, the pos-
terior inclusion probability for summary molecular descriptors reaches
0.97. By incorporating the structure data, our approach uniquely iden-
tifies multiple Alzheimer’s disease signatures, which are consistent
with existing evidence. These results evidently suggest the value of
the proposed approach for metabolomic hypothesis-testing problems.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the last decades, major advances in analytical chemistry
have resulted in the emergence of metabolomics. It enables sim-
ultaneous quantifying of hundreds to thousands of metabolites
present in a set of biological samples, e.g. plasma, urine and
cerebrospinal ﬂuid, to report on metabolic pattern associated
with conditions of interest, such as disease or drug exposure
(Kaddurah—Daouk et al., 2008; Patti et al., 2012). The identities
and concentrations of metabolites, or the so-called metabotype,
reﬂect net interactions between gene and environment, providing
information that can possibly bridge a gap between genotype and
phenotype.

Attesting to this belief, metabolomics has been widely used to
understand disease pathogenesis and drug effects, as well as to
predict variation in drug response, among many other applica-
tions (Corona et al., 2012; Kaddurah—Daouk et al., 2008;
Mamas et al., 2011). These studies typically involve identifying
‘metabolomic signatures’ among the measured metabolites: ex-
amples are metabolites that are inﬂuenced by an environmental
stimulus, e. g. drug treatment, and metabolites that are associated
with a phenotype of interest, e.g. a disease status or drug re-
sponse. Common metabolomics data analysis practice uses con-
ventional statistical inference tools, such as Student’s t-tests and
regression techniques, to identify the signatures. These methods,
as well as many multivariate chemometrics and statistics tools
(Korman et al., 2012; Lindon et al., 2007) that are frequently
used, essentially treat metabolites as individual variables instead
of biological entities, of which rich prior knowledge has been
accumulated and is accessible from literatures and/or databases.
A variety of methodologies have been developed recently to take
advantages of such information to facilitate statistical inference
on omic data: some incorporate network relationships among
the biological entities (Li and Li, 2008; Wei and Pan, 2008),
based on a general assumption that the connected ones on the
network tend to share similar behavior, whereas others perform
selection at the level of pathways (Ramanan et al., 2012; Zhu and
Li, 2011), acknowledging the modularity of biological networks.

A distinctive attribute of metabolites is that each of them can
be characterized by its unique chemical features. These features
can be quantified by a variety of molecular descriptors (MD)
(Todeschini and Consonni, 2009), which transform chemical
structures into numbers (Supplementary Fig. 81). Different
types of MDs can be obtained from existing software, e. g.
Dragon (Talete SRL, Milan, Italy), ranging from simple molecu-
lar properties, e.g. molecular weight and polarity, to elaborative
spatial formulations, e. g. 3D autocorrelations and atom pairs, to
complex molecular fingerprints, e.g. Daylight (http://www.day-
light.com) and UNITY 2D fingerprints (http://www.tripos.com).
It has been acknowledged that many physicochemical or
pharmacological properties of metabolites could be revealed by
their structure information. For instance, medicinal chemists use
the structureiactivity relationships (Carbo-Dorca et al., 2001)
identiﬁed from a series of compounds targeting a specific binding
protein to design new drugs with better bioactivity (Patani and
LaVoie, 1996); toxicologists predict a speciﬁc toxicity profile of a

compound based on its similar key structural moiety with known
toxins (Cronin and Dearden, 1995; Nelson, 2001). It has also
been observed that the levels of metabolites sharing the same
or similar key chemical structures are more likely to be affected
together under certain environmental stimulus. For example,
serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) are both monoamine
neurotransmitters, structurally similar to each other, but
belong to different pathways. Under the stimulus of
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, which interacts with
both 5-HT and DA receptors, the levels of these two metabolites
are both upregulated in the brain, leading to the hallucinogenic
effect (Capela et al., 2009).

Because the function and bioactivity of metabolites are closely
tied to their structure, we hypothesize that integrating the struc-
ture information into the analysis of metabolite concentration
data can signiﬁcantly improve the discovery of metabolomic sig-
natures. To evaluate this hypothesis, we build a regression
normal mixture (RNM) model that can merge information
from the two data sources, metabolites’ concentration data and
their chemical structure data, into the estimation of false discov-
ery rate (FDR), which is nowadays routinely used to control for
multiple testing in metabolomics studies. As an illustrative
example, suppose a total of m metabolites are measured for a
cohort of patients and healthy controls to evaluate the following
null hypotheses: Hi: level of the i-th metabolite is not different
between patients and controls, 1' = 1, ...,m. Depending on the
actual statistical method being used to test the hypotheses,
different types of summary statistics can be derived for each
metabolite, e.g. a t—statistic from a parametric two-sample
t—test, or a sum of ranks from a non-parametric Wilcoxon rank
sum test, along with a P—Value. To control for multiple testing,
the summary test statistics can be ﬁtted to a mixture model
(Efron and Tibshirani, 2002). The model estimates for each me-
tabolite a Bayesian posterior probability of its null hypothesis
being true, based on which various types of FDRs can be calcu-
lated. A standard mixture model assumes the same prior belief/
probability of each metabolite being null. Variations have been
proposed to incorporate additional information into the speciﬁ-
cation of the prior probabilities. One example is the class of
mixtures-of-experts models (McLachlan and Peel, 2000), in
which the prior probabilities are modeled as functions of some
covariates. Wei and Pan (2008) used a spatially correlated mix-
ture model that incorporates network relationships among genes
into the specification of prior probabilities for microarray stu-
dies. The RNM model in our strategy uses several summary
molecular descriptors (SMD) to estimate metabolite-speciﬁc
prior probabilities. We further perform variable selection on
the SMDs, which can suggest how likely they are informative
for a particular metabolomic study. In general, the selected struc-
tural information and the test results based on the concentration
data are jointly used to output chemical structure-informed FDR
for the evaluation of the importance of metabolites.

Based on the RNM model, we propose an integrated chemical
structure-informed metabolomic hypothesis-testing strategy
(Fig. 1). Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the
RNM model both in identifying informative SMD(s) and in im-
proving the identiﬁcation of metabolomic signatures with the
SMDs. As proof-of-concept, we applied the proposed strategy
to a metabolomic study of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A high

2 METHODS

We begin this section with an introduction of quantifying and summariz-
ing the structure information of metabolites with the SMDs, and then
discuss the RNM model that incorporates the SMDs into metabolomic
hypothesis testing. We conclude this section by a summary of the pro-
posed strategy illustrated in Figure 1.

2.1 Obtaining and summarizing molecular descriptors

To quantify the structures of metabolites, we ﬁrst retrieve their canonical
simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings from

online compound libraries, e.g. PubChem (Wang et al., 2009), and then
calculate a wide range of MDs for each metabolite from Dragon Software
(version 5.5). Given the relatively high dimensionality of the MD data
and strong correlations among some MDs, we use principal component
analysis (PCA) to generate lower-dimensional projections that can retain
major variance within the MD data. Because the MDs are typically of
different scales, we standardize them before running PCA. The top d
principal components that capture the largest variance are retained as
SMDs.

2.2 The regression normal mixture model

The RNM model uses the SMDs to facilitate the estimation of FDR for
metabolomic hypothesis testing, which used to be evaluated with the
summary test statistics derived from metabolite concentration data
alone. Many research problems in metabolomics fall into the hypoth-
esis-testing class. Examples include testing which metabolites are inﬂu-
enced by a drug treatment, or which metabolites are associated with a
clinical phenotype. In such cases, each metabolite under study is assumed
to be in either of the following two states: the null hypothesis is true or it
is not true (non-null). We refer to them as null and non-null metabolites,
respectively.

The RNM model adopts a ﬁnite mixture model framework
(McLachlan and Peel, 2000), with which Efron and Tibshirani (2002)
developed empirical Bayesian approaches to deal with large-scale simul-
taneous inference problems in microarray studies. McLachlan et al.
(2006) proposed a simple parametric implementation, namely, a two-
component standard normal mixture (SNM) model, based on normal
transformation to the original test statistics of metabolites. Speciﬁcally,
a z-score can be calculated for a metabolite i from its P-value:
z,- = <1>’1(1 — 17,-), where <1> represents the cumulative standard normal
distribution. Consistent with the P-value, the z-score for a metabolite
reﬂects its statistical signiﬁcance. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume
that the z-scores of the null and non-null metabolites follow distinct dis-
tributions. We use an indicator variable C,- to denote the states of metab-
olites: C,- = 0 (C,- = 1) corresponds to that the null (non-null) hypothesis
holds for the i-th metabolite. Denoting the prior probability of a metab-
olite being null (non-null) as no (:11), i.e. Pr(C,- = 0) = no
(Pr[C,- = 1] = :11), we can represent the density of the z-score for the
i-th metabolite using an SNM model with two components corresponding
to the two states:

f(Zi) =H0f0(Zi)+JT1f1(Zi) (1)
where f0 and f1 represent the null and non-null densities of z-score, re-
spectively. The posterior probability of the metabolite i being null given
its z-score is as follows:

10(4) 2 PKG = Olzi) = Hof0(Zi)=1_ ﬂ1f1(Zi)

114) 114)

This posterior probability is the local FDR deﬁned by Efron and
Tibshirani (2002), which has been a widely used variant of Benjamini
and Hochberg (1995) tail-area FDR. The tail-area FDR is a global meas-
ure of FDR for a given rejection region, e.g. Z 6 [2, + 00), where Z is the
random z-score and l is a given cutoff. Corresponding to the i-th metab-
olite, the tail-area FDR for rejecting Z 3 2,- has a posterior probability
interpretation of Pr(null|Z 3 z,-), which can be shown equal to
Ef['i:0(Z)|Z 3 z,-] (Efron, 2005), where Ef indicates expectation with re-
spect to f(Z). Accordingly, the tail-area FDR corresponding to the i-th
metabolite can be estimated by the average (estimated) local FDR of the
metabolites whose z-scores are not less than 2,-. In the usual situation
where 10(Z) decreases as z-score increases, the tail-area FDR will be
less than the local FDR. Besides, the local FDR has an advantage in
evaluating individual behavior of metabolites (Efron, 2005).

In contrast to the conventional SNM model that assumes the same
prior probabilities of being null to all the metabolites, the RNM model

 

 

ﬁts metabolite-speciﬁc prior probabilities based on the SMDs that sum-
marize the chemical structures of all the metabolites under study.
Corresponding to the SNM model in (1), a two-component RNM
model for f(z,-) is as follows:

lei) = ﬂi,0f0(Zi) + 771', 1f1(Zi) (2)

where 21,30 and 21,-,1 represent the metabolite-speciﬁc prior probabilities for
metabolite i. We estimate them with the SMDs through a legit link
model:

 

d
. JTi

rogue. 1) = 10g(n_’;) = a + Z rm..-

1, 1:1

where D is the design matrix of the SMDs with DM- representing the value
of the j-th SMD for the metabolite i, and ,80 and ,8 = (,81, ..., ,84) are
unknown regression intercept and coefﬁcient parameters, respectively.
Based on (2), the posterior probability of the metabolite i being null is

Pr(Ci=0|D,z,-)=M=1_M

ﬂZi) ﬂZi)

which we call the chemical structure-informed local FDR. Because the
prior probabilities are new unique to each individual metabolite, it is no
longer meaningful to calculate the corresponding tail-area FDR.

Two-sided tests are frequently used in discovery studies. In such cases,
the non-null metabolites can be further divided into two substates
denoted here as negative non-null and positive non-null. Applying the
two-component RNM model essentially assumes the same effect of an
SMD to the prior probabilities of being positive and negative non-null,
which may not be conceivable. To relief this assumption, it is intuitive to
distinguish the two non-null substates in the modeling. The indicator
variable C,- now takes three distinct values: C,- = 0 for null, C,- = 1 for
negative non-null and C,- = 2 for positive non-null. The calculation of
z-score should also reﬂect the direction of the original test results. For
instance, when two-sample t-tests are used to evaluate which metabolites
are different between patients and controls, the z-scores can be
deﬁned as z,- = sgn(t,-)<1>’1(1 — 1),/2), where t,- is t-statistic derived for
the i-th metabolite. With this deﬁnition, either an extreme negative
or extreme positive z-score indicates a departure from the null
hypothesis. We use a three-component RNM model for the density of
such z-scores:

ﬂZi) = ﬂan/[0(4) + 771', lf1(Zi) + 771', 2f2(Zi)

or more speciﬁcally in our application,
f(Z.-) = ni,ori>(Z.-; 0. 03) + ni,1¢(Zi-; M1.Ui)+ Hi,2¢(Z.-; M2. 0%)

where the last two components correspond to the negative and positive
non-null, respectively, with m <0 and in >0. Accordingly, we estimate
the log-ratios of prior probabilities between each non-null state and null
state with the SMDs using the following link models:

log(:+:;)

log(:+::)
The chemical structure-informed local FDRs for the i-th metabolite are as
follows: l—J'rLf1(z,-)/f(z,-) for claiming it being negative non-null and
1 — n2f2(z,-)/f(z,-) for claiming it being positive non-null.

Because all the SMDs may not be informative, we further impose
random effect stochastic search variable selection (Meuwissen and
Goddard, 2004) on them to inform their relevance to the prior probabil-
ities for the null and non-null states of metabolites. To save space, we only
elaborate this for the three-component RNM model, and it is a trivial

task to modify for the two-component model. We assume the intercept
and coefﬁcient parameters for all the SMDs are independent, and let I,”-

be an indicator for the j-th SMD being selected (11“- : 1) or not
(11“- : 0) in the k-th model in (3). The following mixture prior for
,Bk,j,k = 1,2;j: 1, ...,dis used:

f(ﬁk,jl1k,ja0129) = (1 — Ik,j)¢(i5k.j; 0.go§) + Ik,,-¢(i8k,,-; 0. of.)

where g is ﬁxed to be a small positive number (0.001 in our study),
0129 ~ Uniform(0, 20); IkJ-lp, ~ Bernoulli(p,); [7, ~ Uniform(0, 1); and
ﬁlm) ~ N(0,102), for k = 1,2. Under these speciﬁcations, the marginal
prior inclusion probability of each SMD being selected equals to 0.5
(Supplementary Note Sl).

We mainly follow Wei and Pan (2008)’s prior speciﬁcations and use
vague priors for the rest parameters in the RNM model:
11,1 ~ N(0, 106)I(a,0), a truncated normal distribution between
a = miniz, and 0; 11,2 ~ N(0, 106)I(0, b), b = maxizi; and
0,2 ~ InverseGamma(0.1,0.1), for l = 0,1,2. The same speciﬁcations
are also adopted for a three-component SNM model applied in the simu-
lation and the AD studies.

Supplementary Figure S2 shows a graphical representation of the
three-component RNM model. The full speciﬁcation of the model is
given in Supplementary Note S2. The RNM model can be readily imple-
mented in WinBUGS (Lunn et al., 2000) and fitted with Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. To assess the convergence of the
MCMC process and determine the number of burn-ins, we initiate two
chains, one with all the SMDs initially selected and the other with none
selected, and examine the trace plots and the potential scale reduction
factors (Gelman and Rubin, 1992) for 105, ms, 019, IkJ-s and Cs.

As primary indices of interest, the posterior inclusion probabilities of
the SMDs can be estimated from the MCMC sample mean of IkJ-s. The
estimated inclusion probabilities for an SMD measure how often
the SMD is selected into the modeling of the prior probabilities for the
states of metabolites, and thus reﬂects how much the input data, namely,
the SMD data and metabolites’ z-scores, favors the relevance of the SMD
to the states of metabolites. The posterior probabilities of a metabolite
being in null/non-null states can be estimated from the MCMC sample
mean of Cis, from which its corresponding local FDRs can be estimated
as described earlier in the text.

2.3 The chemical structure-informed hypothesis-testing
strategy

Figure 1 illustrates the workﬂow of the entire strategy. To address a
research question of interest, one applies appropriate conventional ana-
lysis, e.g. linear regression, to metabolite concentration data and other
data as needed, e.g. phenotypes, covariates. The analysis gives test stat-
istics and P-values for metabolites under study, which can be transformed
to z-scores (Section 2.2). In parallel, one can obtain chemical structures of
metabolites by searching their names in the chemical libraries, and then
calculate and summarize the MDs for all the metabolites (Section 2.1).
The RNM model takes the two sources of data as inputs and generates
two outputs: the chemical structure-informed FDRs of the metabolites
and the posterior inclusion probabilities of the SMDs. A high posterior
inclusion probability (e.g. >0.8) indicates the SMD’s relevance to the
states of metabolites, and the chemical structure-informed FDR is
likely to outperform the conventional estimation of FDR without incor-
porating the structural information.

3 RESULTS

We evaluated the proposed chemical structure-informed hypoth-
esis-testing strategy at two levels. First, we performed simulation
studies to examine the effectiveness of the RNM model on iden-
tifying potentially informative SMD(s) and non-null metabolites.

Second, we applied the strategy to a real study seeking new
metabolomic signatures for AD.

3.1 Simulation studies

We simulated diverse scenarios to evaluate the RNM model that
incorporates the SMDs into the estimation of local FDR by
varying the following factors: the total number of metabolites,
the percentages of non-null metabolites, the total number of
SMDs and the number and effect sizes of informative SMDs.
We examined the posterior probabilities of the informative
SMD(s) being selected and compared them with those of the
non-informative ones. We then performed Receiver-Operating
Characteristics curve (ROC) analysis to evaluate its performance
on identifying non-null metabolites.

3.1.] Simulation setup Settings for different simulation scen-
arios are shown in Table 1. In each scenario, the null/non-null
state of the i-th metabolite was generated based on the following
values: SL1: 27:1/31JD1J + 81,; and 52,1: 27:1[32’jDi’j + 62,1.
Dws were independently and randomly sampled from N(0,1),
and D was then orthogonally transformed to mimic SMDs pro-
duced by PCA; eh,- and e1,- are random noises sampled from
N(0,1), which introduce uncertainties in determining the null/
non-null states of metabolites. The first m1 (m2) metabolites
having the largest S1 (S2) values were assigned to be negative
(positive) non-null. Occasionally, there were metabolites assigned
to both states. Such metabolites were assigned to the larger one
between S1 and S2, and the search continued until all the m1 and
In; metabolites were selected. All the rest of metabolites were
null. Given the null/non-null states of metabolites, zi was
sampled from

¢(Zi; 0, 1) if C,- = 0 (null)
f(ZilCi) = ¢(Zi; —l, 1) if C,- = 1 (negative non — null)
¢(Zi; 1, 1) if C,- = 2 (positive on — null)

Applying the RNM model to the simulated SMDs and z—scores,
one can estimate the posterior probabilities of each metabolite
being in different states. By varying cutoffs on the posterior
probabilities, we performed ROC analysis for distinguishing
each pair of states and derived the area under the curve (AUC)
values, the main index for method evaluation.

To better assess the potential beneﬁt from incorporating struc-
ture information with the RNM model, we compared its AUC
scores with the optimal AUCs that can be achieved with the
z—scores alone. Speciﬁcally, for discriminating any pair of
states, l1 versus l2, the NeymaniPearson lemma establishes that
the true likelihood ratio, f(z,-|C,- = l1)/f(z,-| C,- 2 l2), or any mono-
tone increasing function of it, maximizes the height of ROC all
the way along the curve (thus the optimal AUC is achieved)
(Eguchi and Copas, 2002). The optimal AUC values of the like-
lihood ratios can be determined analytically (Faraggi and Reiser,
2002), and are 0.76 for null versus either non-null state given the
current null and non-null densities of z—score.

times. Inference was made on 10000 MCMC samples after
20 000 burn-ins with a thinning rate of 10. The potential scale

Note: The last two columns give average values (over 100 simulations) of the posterior inclusion probabilities of SMDs and the AUC values for distinguishing non—null from
null metabolites. The standard deviations of AUCs are given in parentheses. For comparison, the AUCs that can be achieved with the true likelihood ratios based on z—scores

alone are 0.76 for null versus either non—null state.

reduction factors for the parameters under examination are all
below 1.1 (results not shown), indicating that there is no sug-
gested evidence of lack of convergence. Simulation results are
given in Table 1.

Each run of Scenario 1 simulates 200 metabolites, and the
percentages of positive and negative non-null metabolites are
both 10%. One of the five SMDs is related to the null/non—null
states of metabolites. Results show that the posterior inclusion
probabilities for the informative SMD are 0.1 over those of the
non-informative ones. Correspondingly, the AUCs of incorpor-
ating structure information with the RNM model are clearly
higher than those of the true likelihood ratio on z—scores. It is
not surprising to see that the advantage of incorporating struc-
ture information further increases with the following changes to
the simulation settings: increasing the effect size of the inform-
ative SMD (Scenario 2), reducing the number of non-informative
SMDs (Scenario 3), increasing the number of informative SMDs
(Scenario 4) or increasing the total number of metabolites
(Scenario 5). In all of these studies, the informative SMD(s)
has notably higher posterior inclusion probabilities than the
non-informative ones, and the difference is enlarged with
increased effect size of the informative SMD (Scenario 2) and/
or increased number of metabolites (Scenario 5). In Scenario 6,
the percentages of negative and positive non-null become 20%
and 5%, respectively. By comparing Scenario 6 with Scenario 1,
one can see that the posterior inclusion probability for the in-
formative SMD (and its difference from those of the non-inform-
ative ones) also varies positively with the percentage of non-null
metabolites. When none of the SMDs is informative (Scenario 7),
the posterior inclusion probabilities for the SMDs are all around
0.35 ~ 0.36. Correspondingly, incorporating these SMDs does
not show advantage in identifying non-null metabolites. In meta-
bolomics studies, metabolites are often found correlated. To
examine the behavior of the RNM model in this situation, we

further divided the 200 metabolites into 10 groups in Scenario 3,
and let pairwise correlations of the SMDs (DI'J’S) for metabolites
within each group be 0.5 (compound symmetric structure).
Additionally, to simulate correlation among metabolites that is
not related to structural similarity, we adopted the same correl-
ation structure for the random noises (e1, ,- and em). Results show
that the AUCs of the RNM model remain the same (0.87 and
0.88), indicating the model is robust to correlation among me-
tabolites. Finally, to examine whether the proposed strategy will
inﬂate the type I error, we simulated a scenario where there are
no true non-null metabolites. We used the same simulation set-
tings for Scenario 3, except that only the 160 null metabolites
were analyzed with (the RNM model) and without (the SNM
model) incorporating structure information. Supplementary
Figure S3 gives the distribution of the estimated posterior prob-
abilities of being non-null for the 160 metabolites over 100 runs.
Compared with the SNM model, the RNM model in general
gives lower posterior probabilities for the metabolites being
non-null. In other words, in the case of no non-null metabolites,
incorporating molecular structure information with the proposed
approach leads to higher estimated FDR than the conventional
approach.

In general, the simulation studies demonstrate that posterior
inclusion probabilities for the SMDs can help identify inform-
ative SMD(s) and indicate whether a particular study can beneﬁt
from adopting the proposed approach. When informative
SMDs exist, the RNM model is able to make use of such infor-
mation to improve the discrimination between null and non-null
metabolites.

3.2 Metabolomic signatures for Alzheimer’s disease

We then applied the proposed approach to a clinical metabolo-
mic study of AD (Kaddurah—Daouk et al., 2013; Motsinger-Reif

et al., 2013). The AD is a well-known neurodegenerative disorder
and a leading cause of dementia with currently no effective cure or
preventive therapy (http://www.alz.org). Our goal is to identify
metabolites that have different levels between AD patients and
cognitively normal (CN) participants, which may lead to new bio-
markers and provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic insights.
Cerebrospinal ﬂuid samples from 40 AD and 38 CN participants
were proﬁled with two platforms, a liquid chromatography elec-
trochemical array and a gas chromatography time-of-ﬂight mass
spectrometer. A total of 121 metabolites was structurally identi-
ﬁed (Supplementary Table S1). The null hypothesis for a metab-
olite is that there is no difference in its level between AD and CN
groups, denoted by AD 2 CN, whereas the positive non-null (nega-
tive non-null) is that its level is higher (lower) in the AD group than
CN, denoted by AD > CN (AD < CN). Levels of metabolites were
adjusted for the use of two AD treatment drugs (binary variables)
by building a linear regression model for each metabolite, and the
residuals are compared between AD and CN with Wilcoxon rank
sum tests. A z—score was calculated for each metabolite from its P-
value and HodgesiLehmann estimation of the difference between
AD and CN subjects. To implement the proposed strategy, we
calculated 882 MDs from Dragon software, which involve (but
not limited to) ring descriptors, topological indices, walk and path
counts, connectivity indices and geometrical descriptors. The
MDs with zero variance for the metabolites under study were
removed. One from each pair of highly correlated MDs (correl-
ation coefﬁcient 30.95) was removed. After these steps, 202 MDs
remained (Supplementary Table S2), and the top ﬁve SMDs were
retained. They capture 53.5% of the total variance and the ﬁrst
SMD captures 21.4%. The SMDs and the z—scores derived earlier
in the text were then fitted to a three-component RNM model to
estimate local FDR of metabolites as described in Section 2. For
comparison purpose, we also applied a three-component SNM
model not incorporating the structure information to the z-
scores, which has the same speciﬁcation for the null/non—null den-
sities for z,- and prior distributions for the mean and variance
parameters as the RNM model.

Results show that the posterior inclusion probability for the
ﬁrst SMD in the modeling of the prior probability ratio between
AD>CN and AD: CN reaches 0.97, and is much higher than
those for the rest SMDs (Fig. 2). This suggests that the structure
data are highly likely to be informative for the identiﬁcation of
metabolites that are increased in AD. The top 10 MDs with the
highest contribution to this SMD are given in Supplementary
Table S3. Table 2 provides results for the metabolites that are
given the lowest (50.05) chemical structure-informed local FDR.
A histogram for the posterior probabilities of being non-null for
all the metabolites is available in Supplementary Figure S4. The
average posterior probabilities for AD< CN and AD> CN
among all the metabolites given by the proposed strategy are
0.03 and 0.40, respectively, lower than those (0.09 and 0.52)
given by the conventional SNM model not incorporating struc-
ture information. Compared with the conventional approach,
our approach promotes multiple metabolites that are mapped
to two key neurotransmitter pathways: the purine and trypto-
phan metabolism pathways (Fig. 3). Also promoted are three
carbohydrates and the pseudouridine.

In the purine pathway, guanosine (GR) and inosine (IN) are
promoted by the proposed approaches, whereas xanthosine

0(ANTH) ranks highest by both the proposed and conventional
approaches. As shown in Figure 3a, cyclic adenosine mono-
phosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate
(cGMP) are hydrolyzed by phosphodiesterase, whose expression
and activity has been shown upregulated in AD patients
(Domek-Lopacinska and Strosznajder, 2010), leading to
decreased cGMP and cAMP and increased GR, IN, and
XANTH. The decreased level of cGMP and cAMP, two import-
ant secondary messengers, is one of the key reasons for early AD
symptoms, such as memory loss and poor judgment.

The proposed approach also highlights the abnormalities of
tryptophan (TRP), 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), 5-hydroxyin-
doleacetic acid (5-HIAA), kynurenine (KYN) and indole-3-acetic
acid (I-3-AA) in AD, which are all involved in the TRP metab-
olism pathway. The mechanism underlying the increased concen-
tration of 5-HTP and 5-HIAA may involve the upregulated
monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) activity in AD, which has
shown strong association with increased serotonin deamination
(Kumagae et al., 1991), and thus the level of metabolites in the
5-HIAA branch. Recent studies show a markedly increased

concentration of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, a type 1
cytokine, in AD patients (Zhang et al., 2013), which induces
indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activation and thus
upregulates the catabolism of TRP into KYN, 3-hydroxykynur-
enine (3-OHKY) and quinolinic acid (QUIN). The increased
level of I-3-AA might be another pathogenesis of AD due to
its cytotoxic effect to neurons: the administration of I-3-AA in
pregnant mice has been found to induce neuroepithelium

apoptosis and decrease neuron formation in the fetuses
(Furukawa et al., 2007). Our ﬁndings provide further evidence
for the involvement of the tryptophan pathway in elucidating the
mechanisms of AD.

Maltose, inulobiose and sucrose are a group of carbohydrates
highlighted by the proposed approach. Excess intake of these
natural or artiﬁcial sweeteners has been shown in mouse
models to cause insulin resistance and metabolic alterations
(Cao et al., 2007;Carvalho et al., 2012), which play important
roles in the exacerbation of oxidative stress, mitochondrial
abnormalities and increased amyloid )3 protein levels in the
brain. The correlation between high-carbohydrate diets and
AD has been also reported in human studies (Henderson, 2004).

Pseudouridine (\11) is the oxidized form of urinary nucleosides
(Charette and Gray, 2000). Oxidative damage of RNA plays a
critical role in the mechanisms of neurodegenerative disorders,
including AD (Shan et al., 2007). The potential mechanism of
\IJ-induced brain damage might arise from the additional hydro-
gen bond in its structure compared with uridine, leading to
increased risk of hydrogen bonding with the phosphate of its
own or adjacent nucleotides. This structural change on RNA
might cause an incorrect translation and thus decreased protein
production and function in the brain. In addition, an increased
level of pseudouridine in urine samples of AD patients has been
reported recently (Lee et al., 2007).

In summary, top metabolomic signatures identiﬁed by the
proposed approach highlight four mechanisms likely to play crit-
ical roles in the etiology of AD. They are either evidenced by
in vivo animal studies and/or supported by observations in
human patients. On one hand, these results reﬂect the heteroge-
neous and multifactorial nature of AD; on the other, they show
the advantage of the proposed chemical structure-informed hy-
pothesis-testing strategy.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we have motivated and presented a new approach
featured as chemical structure-informed metabolomic hypothesis
testing. Simulation studies suggest that when some of the struc-
ture data is relevant to the null/non-null states of metabolites, the
new approach shows clear advantage on the identiﬁcation of
non-null metabolites. By implementing the proposed approach
to identify metabolomic signatures for AD, we ﬁnd an SMD
being selected with high posterior probability and underscore
several pathways or groups of metabolites as potential AD
signatures that are well supported by the existing knowledge
on the molecular mechanisms of AD. Although further studies
are needed to validate the new findings, we think that the joint
evidence strongly attests to the advantages of the proposed
approach in this study.

The proposed chemical structure-informed approach differs in
multiple aspects from the class of network-based approaches
mentioned earlier in Section 1, which may make the former
more preferable for metabolomics studies. First, owing to their
limited analytical capability, many if not the majority of the
current metabolomics studies only measure a limited number
of structurally identiﬁed metabolites. This lack of coverage of
metabolic networks typically makes it practically infeasible to
apply the network-based approaches. In contrast, the proposed

approach is readily applicable to these studies. Additionally, the
network-based approaches may miss some coregulation relation-
ships among metabolites that share the same or similar key
chemical structures but are not close on the networks, e.g. the
coregulation relationship between 5-HT and DA discussed in
Section 1. In another aspect, the common assumption made by
the network-based approaches that metabolites connected on the
networks tend to share similar behavior is often realized by
encouraging similarities among parameters/coefﬁcients corres-
ponding to connected variables on the networks. On the con-
trary, the proposed approach does not simply assume
metabolites sharing similar structure would behave similarly; in-
stead, it performs selection on the structure data, so that the
most relevant SMDs have more weight in determining the
states of metabolites.

Different from the standard mixture models, the RNM model
in our approach regresses prior probabilities for metabolites
being in different states on several SMDs, where metabolites
may be regarded as individual ‘observations’. Simulation studies
show that increasing the number of metabolites can improve the
estimation of the effects of SMDs and thus the states of metab-
olites. Because SMDs are generated from PCA, the percentage of
total variance captured by the top ones is typically considered for
choosing the number of SMDs. In practice, however, model
complexity is another issue that should be considered, especially
when the number of metabolites is limited. In the AD study, we
take a conservative number of five SMDs and the first SMD is
found most likely to be informative.

The current modeling of prior probabilities for the null and
non-null states of metabolites in (3) considers the states of me-
tabolites as a nominal response variable. However, it is arguably
more intuitive to treat it as an ordinal response and use the cor-
responding link models, e.g. the cumulative link models (Agresti,
2002). Some of them, e. g. the proportional odds models, assume
each SMD has the same effect in the modeling of different prior
probability ratios. It can be seen that this assumption does not
stand in the AD study. The generalized proportional odds logit
models allow different effects of the same SMD (Agresti, 2002).
Speciﬁcally, the ratios of prior probabilities on the left side of (3)
become 71,-,1/(7130 + 71,-,2) and 71,-,2/(7130 + 71,-,1). This way of mod-
eling was implemented in both simulations and the AD study,
and it gives similar results (not shown). One can also modify the
prior speciﬁcation for the regression coefﬁcients in (3) to jointly
select one SMD in both link models, or to incorporate prior
beliefs on the effects of SMDs.

Although the AD study shows favorable evidence for the pro-
posed approach, it is not our intention to claim that it is pre-
scriptive for studies of all different phenotypes. Instead, to
inform whether the structure information should be incorpo-
rated, the RNM model is accompanied by a selection on
the SMDs through stochastic search variable selection. Via
MCMC methods, this addition also introduces a Bayesian
model averaging (Clyde, 1999) for the estimation of the states
of metabolites, whose advantage in estimation accuracy has been
well documented (Hoeting et al.,1999; Raftery and Zheng, 2003).
Besides, the proposed approach is tested with metabolites from
two analytical platforms, which only cover a portion of the entire
metabolome. Evaluation should be extended to more studies and
different classes of metabolites.

Finally, the proposed approach focuses on the general meta-
bolomic hypothesis-testing problem, whereas incorporating
structure information into other common metabolomic inference
practices, such as multivariate predictive model construction and
network inference, is warranted for further research.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Analyzing data from multi-platform genomics experiments
combined with patients’ clinical outcomes helps us understand the
complex biological processes that characterize a disease, as well as
how these processes relate to the development of the disease.
Current data integration approaches are limited in that they do not
consider the fundamental biological relationships that exist among
the data obtained from different platforms.

Statistical Model: We propose an integrative Bayesian analysis
of genomics data (iBAG) framework for identifying important genes/
biomarkers that are associated with clinical outcome. This framework
uses hierarchical modeling to combine the data obtained from multiple
platforms into one model.

Results: We assess the performance of our methods using several
synthetic and real examples. Simulations show our integrative meth-
ods to have higher power to detect disease-related genes than
non-integrative methods. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas glioblast-
oma dataset, we apply the iBAG model to integrate gene expression
and methylation data to study their associations with patient survival.
Our proposed method discovers multiple methylation-regulated genes
that are related to patient survival, most of which have important
biological functions in other diseases but have not been previously
studied in glioblastoma.

1 INTRODUCTION

The overarching goal of cancer genomics is to customize patient
care decisions according to diverse genetic and epigenetic alter-
ations for a tumor (Chin et al., 2011; Vogelstein and Kinzler,
1993; Weir et al., 2004). Early cancer genomics studies focused
on only a single type of alteration at a time to assess these
changes, e.g. high-resolution copy number proﬁling led to the
discovery of novel oncogenes in ovarian cancer (Nanjundan
et al., 2007), melanoma (Scott et al., 2009) and lung carcinoma
(Bass et al., 2009). Some of these findings have already been

translated into personalized cancer treatment, such as imatinib
for KIT-mutated gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Handolias
et al., 2010) and trastuzumab for HER2—positive breast tumors
(Pegram and Slamon, 2000).

As technologies to perform comprehensive profiling of the
cancer genome have progressed, different technology platforms,
from basic capillary electrophoresis sequencing to advanced
forms of microarrays, have been brought together on the
same patient set. For example, the Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) is a worldwide research program that currently
encompasses comprehensive genomic datasets for >20 types
of cancer (http://cancergemone.nih.gov; Hudson et al., 2010).
The work of TCGA is motivating approaches for integrating
data outputs from different types of technology platforms to
identify important biomarkers related to cancer development
and progression. The key hypothesis behind these approaches
is that cancer consists of hundreds of distinct molecular
changes, from multiple types of genetic and epigenetic alter-
ations to the interactions among them. Each type of alteration
provides a different and complementary View of the whole
genome. Hence, integrating multiple aspects of the genome
and the underlying biological processes to identify novel targets
is essential and has the potential to improve the clinical man-
agement of cancer.

The concept of integration is very broad (see review by Hamid
et al., 2009). Such integration studies can be divided into three
general groups according to the primary focus of the study
(Daemen et al., 2009). The focus of the ﬁrst group, called sequen-
tial integration studies, is the sequential analysis of heterogeneous
data from different platforms for the purpose of understanding
the biological evolution of disease as opposed to predicting clin-
ical outcome (Fridlyand et al., 2006; Qin, 2008; Tomioka et al.,
2008). In this group, data obtained on one type of platform are
analyzed along with the clinical outcome data, and then a second
data platform is subsequently used to clarify or confirm the
results obtained from the ﬁrst platform. For example, Qin
(2008) showed that microRNA expression can be used to sort
tumors from normal tissues, regardless of tumor type. The study
then analyzed the relationship between the candidate target genes
for the cancer-related microRNAs and mRNA expression and
disease status.

The focus of the second group of integration studies, which
we call biological integration studies, is the analysis of biolo-
gical pathways and regulatory mechanisms among data

obtained from different platforms, such as the relationship
between gene expression and protein abundances, or the rela-
tionship between gene expression and copy number changes
in patient tumor samples (Karpenko and Dai, 2010; van
Wieringen et al., 2012; Waters et al., 2006). The challenge
for this group of studies is that the biological annotation data-
bases used for mapping different datasets are inconsistent. An
R-package to match array comparative genomic hybridization
(CGH) and gene expression microarray features for integrative
analysis purposes was provided by van Wieringen et al. (2012).

The focus of the third group of integration studies, which
we term model-based integration studies, is the analysis of data
obtained from multiple platforms that are combined into one
statistical model to identify clinically relevant genes and/or to
predict clinical outcome. Instead of merging datasets or analyz-
ing them sequentially, the data from different platforms are
treated equally, and the most relevant features are selected
from all available platforms (Daemen et al., 2009; Lanckriet
et al., 2004). For example, Daemen et al. (2009) proposed a
kernel-based approach to integrate data from multiple plat-
forms for the classiﬁcation of discrete clinical outcomes.
They showed that the area under curve (AUC) based on inte-
grated data used for predictions was signiﬁcantly improved
compared with the AUC based on data from a single platform.
However, these studies treated each platform independently
and ignored the underlying biological mechanisms among dif-
ferent platforms. Witten and Tibshirani (2009) developed a
supervised canonical correlation model to find signiﬁcant
axes of correlations between multiple multivariate datasets at
a global (chromosomal) level. They integrated copy number
and gene expression data and identiﬁed linear combinations
(canonical variables) that are related to a clinical outcome.
However, they also did not take the biological mechanisms
(directionality) into account, as we detail later in the text.

Our proposed method takes a different approach in modeling
biological relationships among molecular features measured by
different platforms, by focusing on relationships at a ‘gene-
centric’ level. We ﬁrst study the underlying biological mechan-
isms, relating the data across the different platforms. Then using
this information, we partition gene expression into different
(independent) units and use this to identify genes relevant to
clinical outcome as modulated by these different platforms. We
hypothesize (and show) that, compared with non-integrative
methods, our proposed method can detect clinically relevant
gene expression changes with greater power and a lower false
discovery rate (FDR), in addition to obtaining results that are
more biologically interpretable.

Molecular biology has shown that features identiﬁed on dif-
ferent platforms inﬂuence clinical outcome at different levels.
For example, in TCGA studies, copy number, methylation, mu-
tation status, mRNA expression, microRNA expression and the
expression of proteins in speciﬁc signaling pathways have been
measured on the same set of samples. The fundamental biolo-
gical relationships among the products of these different plat-
forms and their associations with clinical outcome are shown
in Figure 1. Generally speaking, molecular features measured
at the transcript level (e. g. mRNA expression) affect clinical out-
come more directly than molecular features measured at the
DNA/epigenetics level (e.g. copy number, methylation and

mutation status). Molecular features measured at the DNA
level affect clinical outcome by inﬂuencing mRNA expression
(Fabiani et al., 2010; Glinsky, 2006; de Tayrac et al., 2009).
Similarly, microRNAs, post-transcriptional regulators that
bind to complementary sequences on target mRNAs, inﬂuence
mRNA through translational repression or target degradation,
which then affects clinical outcome (Tseng et al., 2011).

Conducting the proposed integrative analysis is a challenge
because of the complicated biological relationships and the dif-
ferent intrinsic structures of various platforms. For example, mo-
lecular features measured at the DNA level regulate the mRNA
expressions of the corresponding genes or nearby genes (Peng
et al., 2010). In contrast, microRNAs can regulate the mRNA
expression of any gene, regardless of its locus, and each
microRNA molecule has multiple target genes. Another chal-
lenge underlying this analysis is the large scale of the different
types of gene alterations in contrast to the limited number of
patient samples for such a study. Hence, an easily implemented
and efﬁcient variable selection method is needed for such an
integration analysis.

We have developed the integrative Bayesian analysis of gen-
omics data (iBAG) model to address these challenges. The main
advantages of our proposed model can be summarized as fol-
lows. The iBAG model (i) uses a hierarchical approach to model
the fundamental biological relationships underlying molecular
features obtained by different platforms; (ii) accounts for both
the inﬂuences of different platforms and the biological relation-
ships among the platforms in one uniﬁed model to predict
patients’ clinical outcomes; (iii) can conduct high-dimensional
variable selection, which adapts to analyzing hundreds of distinct
molecular entity effects jointly in one model; (iv) uses a Bayesian
framework, which allows the model enough ﬂexibility to estimate
the different intrinsic structures of biological relationships for
different high-throughput platforms; and (V) is computationally
efﬁcient and feasible owing to its closed forms of full conditional
posterior distributions for posterior sampling.

The rest of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we describe the iBAG model construction along with prior
formulations for continuous, discrete and survival clinical out-
comes. In Section 3, we introduce an innovative approach for
conducting high-dimensional variable selection using Bayesian
FDRs. In Section 4, we illustrate the performance of the iBAG
model and use simulations to compare its performance with
those of alternative approaches. In Section 5, we apply the
iBAG model to integrate gene expression and methylation data
for TCGA’s glioblastoma study, and evaluate the associations

between those data and patients’ survival times. Finally, we
provide a summary and discussion in Section 6. The technical
details and additional simulation results are contained in the
Supplementary Material (Section S1).

2 THE iBAG MODEL

For ease of interpretation and exposition, we illustrate our
methodology using two platforms at a timeiDNA methylation
and gene expression data. Integration across more than two
platforms can be done in an analogous manner, as discussed in
Section 6.

2.1 Model for continuous outcome

Suppose the total number of patients is N. For the nth patient,
our observed datum consists ofi(i) Y”, the clinical outcome of
interest [e.g. survival time, tumor(sub)type], (ii) (mm, ...,mnl),
the measures of methylation levels for J probes/ sites on the whole
genome, (iii) (gm, ..., gnK), the measures of gene expression
level for K genes, and (iv) (cm, ..., m), the values of L clinical
(non-genomic) factors (e.g. tumor stage, age and other
demographic variables). Hence, all of the observed datasets
in our study can be denoted (in matrix notation) as
{Yles MNXJ: GNxK: CNxL}-

We propose the following two-component hierarchical con-
struction for our iBAG model: a mechanistic model to infer
direct effects of methylation on gene expression, and a clinical
model that uses this information to predict a clinical outcome.
The first component of our model assesses the underlying biolo-
gical relationship between methylation and gene expression.
The expression level of a gene is affected primarily by the methy-
lation sites in the promoter region and is usually lower when
its promoter is highly methylated. However, methylation is
only one of the many potential factors contributing to a
change in gene expression level (as shown in Fig. 1). The mech-
anistic model regresses the measure of gene expression for the
kth gene (mk) on the methylation measures obtained within
the promoter of the kth gene. To match the methylation sites
to a given gene, we use the annotation ﬁles for the platforms and
use those methylation sites that are encompassed within the pro-
moter region of a given geneithus potentially allowing multiple
methylation sites to map to a particular gene. The second com-
ponent of our model assesses when the expression of a particular
gene affects the clinical outcome, whether this effect is modulated
through methylation and/or through some other mechanisms
that are independent of methylation (e. g. microRNA, copy

number effects).
Mechanistic Model: G 2 GM + GM, GM 2 M9; (1)
Clinical Model: Y = CyC + GMyM + GMyM + e.

The parameters of the mechanistic and clinical models have
the following interpretations:

0 GM 2 (gan)NxK= (gfl, ...,gj‘g), where gig” denotes the part
of the expression changes of the kth gene expression feature
that is modulated through methylation (M).

0 GM 2 ggfl, . “31,2421, where g}? is an Nx 1 vector that de-
notes t e part of t e expression changes of the kth gene
expression feature that is modulated by mechanisms other
than methylation (e.g. microRNA, copy number effects).
We assume that gﬁl follows a multivariate normal distribu-
tion with mean 0 and covariance matrix O’IEINXN for
k = 1, ...,K.

0 £2 = (wjk)JxK, where wjk is the ‘gene-methylation’ effect
that estimates the (conditional) effect of the jth methylation
feature on the kth feature identiﬁed from the gene expres-
sion data.

0 yC = (le, ...,yLC), where ylc denotes the effect of the lth
clinical factor on clinical outcome Y.

o yM = (14”, . . . , 3/24), where y}? estimates the effect of g}? on
Y, which can be interpreted as the effect of gene expression
modulated by methylation for the kth feature
identiﬁed from the gene expression data. We denote this
partial effect of gene expression on clinical outcome as a
type M eﬂect.

o yM = (yf‘l, . . . , 3/24), where yfy measures the effect ofggl on
Y, which can be interpreted as the effect of gene expression
modulated by other sources for the kth feature identified
from the gene expression data. We denote this partial gene
expression effect on clinical outcome as a type M effect.

c e is the error term that accounts for variation not explained
by the observed genomic and clinical factors and which is
assumed to follow a normal distribution with a common
standard deviation 0.

In essence, our mechanistic model divides the gene expression
levels into two componentsione modulated by methylation
(GM) and the other independent of methylation (GM)7and
uses both of these components (jointly) in the clinical model
for the prediction of relevant outcomes. Figure 2 further exem-
pliﬁes the architecture of the iBAG model for integrating
data from two platforms. The formal directed acyclic graphical
representation is given in Supplementary Fig. S1.

2.2 Prior construction

high-dimensional problemias both the number of genes (K) and
methylation features (J) are potentially of very high dimension
(on the level of thousands) as compared with the sample size
(N =hundreds), and most of the genes are expected to have
very weak effects on clinical outcome. We use a Bayesian pena-
lized regression approach that not only jointly models the mech-
anistic and clinical components in Equation (1) but also provides
a natural approach for imposing sparsity and performing vari-
able selection Via hierarchical priors. 7

We denote our full parameter set as M = {yM,yM,yC,
£2, a, 01, . . . , 0K} and specify our prior construction for each of
these parameters. To model the main constructs of interest,
1)./M, yM,§2 , we use the Bayesian formulation of the lasso

ibshirani, 1996), which serves a dual purpose. First, similar
to the lasso regression with L1 penalty, it achieves sparsity
(variable selection) Via non-linear shrinkage of small/weak
effects toward zero. This approach has proven to be useful in
identifying genomic features with large effects on clinical out-
comes in various genomic studies (Hoggart et al., 2008; Li
et al., 2011). Second, and more importantly, as the complete
conditionals are available in closed forms, the Bayesian forma-
tion of the lasso substantially aids our Bayesian computations
for large genomic datasets such as those considered here.
Speciﬁcally, we can write the double exponential (lasso) prior
distribution as a scale mixture of a normal distribution with an
exponential mixing density (Park and Casella, 2008), which
allows us to use Gibbs sampling to draw the samples from the
posterior distribution.

Thus our (conditional) Bayesian lasso prior for the type M
effects 0/”) can be written as

M M N XE _ M M
[y n ,a] Hzaexm A in Va),
k=l

where AM is the shrinkage parameter for the vector V”, and
a is the standard deviation for the random error term 8.
Similarly, we deﬁne a Bayesian lasso prior for V”, conditioned
on the (different) shrinkage parameter AM and the (same) stand-
ard deviation 0.

For (2, which models the gene-methylation effects in the
mechanistic model, we adopt the following strategy. When the
number of features matching a given gene (promoter) is lower
than the sample size (N) (e.g. methylation features), we assume
that wjk follows a normal distribution if mj is within the kth gene
promoter and (011,20, otherwise. In cases where the number of
probes/features exceeds N for a particular gene (e. g. microRNA
features), we allow for a Bayesian lasso prior, as described earlier
in the text, to achieve regularization.

For yc = (le)1X L, which models the effects of clinical factors,
we simply assume that the prior of each ylc is a multivariate
normal distribution with mean 0 and large variance (e.g. on
the order of 106 for a variable with standard deviation: 1).
For the error variance (02 and 0%, ...,a}), we assume an im-
proper prior 7'r(02) = 1/02. For other hyper parameters in the
hierarchical model, we assume a gamma prior on (AM)2 and
(A7M)2, with mean parameter 0/”, 01M and scale parameter 5M,
5M, respectively. In our applications, we assume the values of

0/”, 01M, 5M and 5M are all equal to 1.

2.3 Estimation via Markov chain Monte Carlo
Our complete iBAG model can be expressed hierarchically as
[HQ 6. M; M] = Cyc + (MmyM + (G — Mow + e;

[gklZ: wg] = mg + gill,ng ~ MNNm, aileN);

where MN K(u, 2) denotes the K dimensional multivariate
normal distribution with mean u and covariance matrix 2.

To conduct estimation and subsequent inference, we follow a
fully Bayesian analysis of the iBAG model speciﬁed above using
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches (Casella and
George, 1992). Speciﬁcally, we iteratively draw posterior samples
from the full conditional distributions of the parameter sets, as
speciﬁed below.

2.4 iBAG model for discrete and censored outcomes

The construction of the iBAG model can be easily extended
to model discrete and censored outcomes using latent variable
formulations (Albert and Chib, 1993). Specifically, when Y is a
binary variable taking values of 0 or 1 [e. g. tumor-(sub)type], we
use a probit latent-variable formulation that preserves all the
conjugate constructions. We let Z be the (unobserved) latent
variable that relates to Y as follows,

ion>0

1
Y" _ {0 Otherwise for n _ 1, ...,N.

Then conditionally (on Z) our iBAG model for discrete
responses is the same as that shown in Equation (1), with Y in
the clinical model replaced by Z and parameter representations
and corresponding interpretations remaining exactly the same as
those for continuous outcomes.

If the clinical outcome of interest is patient survival time (with
censoring), we use the accelerated failure time model with a data
augmentation approach (Tanner and Wong, 1987) to impute the
censored values for this study. We let t = (t1, . . . , tN) denote the
survival time and (3 = (81, ...,8N) denote the censoring status.
Still, we let Z = (21, .. . , ZN) denote an unobserved latent vari-
able. Given the latent variable Z for right-censored responses,
the expression of the iBAG model is similar to Equation (1),
changing the response variable Y to Z.

The relationship between clinical outcome (tmdn) and the
latent variable Zn can be expressed as

{log(t,,) 2 Zn if 8,, = 1

10g(tn)>Zn if 6., = 0for " = 1: 

The full conditionals and the MCMC sampling schemes
for discrete and survival responses are provided in the
Supplementary Material (Section S2).

3 GENE SELECTION VIA FDRs

Our posterior sampling schemes for the iBAG model result in
MCMC samples for all model parameters and, of speciﬁc interest
to our study, the effects of gene expression levels on clinical
outcomes modulated by and independent of methylation
{yM,yM}. One key issue is to summarize this information in
the MCMC samples to conduct gene selection. Typical inferen-
tial approaches, such as selection based on posterior quantiles or
the maximum a posteriori (MAP) Via MCMC samples, suffer
from two drawbacks. First, the Bayesian lasso has excellent
shrinkage properties but does not conduct natural model/
variable selection, as it does not set the effects exactly equal
to 0 (owing to an absolutely continuous prior). Second, such
inferential methods do not allow for the natural incorporation
of FDR controls that are commonly used in high-dimensional
settings (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Storey and Tibshirani,
2003).

We propose an alternative approach to obtaining posterior
probabilities to evaluate the signiﬁcance of gene expression
effects that facilitates efﬁcient FDR-based inferences. Let
{Mslil denote the S MCMC posterior samples for the model
parameters. When the clinical outcome Y is continuous, for
each MCMC sample, we compute the (conditional) MAP esti-
mate of {1234, 34”}, conditional on all other model parameters that
can be obtained by minimizing the following objective/loss
function:

llY— Cyf — GMy,M — Gwyn; MillinMni +l§lllr§llln (2)

where H - ll, is the l-norm, and Y is the observed continuous
outcome. When the clinical outcome is discrete or censored,
the MAP estimate of {Mg/KM} can be obtained similarly by
replacing Y in Equation (2) with the MCMC samples for the
unobserved latent variable Z. Equation (2) is similar to the pena-
lized objective function in the frequentist lasso (Tibshirani, 1996)
with two different shrinkage parameters (AM, AMFhowever,
with the key difference that it conditions on all the other
model parameters, thus accounting for uncertainty. There are
several algorithms available for computing the MAP estimate.
We use the computationally efﬁcient least angle regression selec-
tion algorithm (Efron et al., 2004) to compute the estimates.
We denote the resulting (conditional) estimates as 321% and 321%
for the kth gene feature. Finally, we estimate the posterior
probability of signiﬁcance (ply, pic”) by computing the (empirical)
frequencies of the non-zero elements in the MAP estimates for
each gene k as

1 s 7 1 s 7
pi? = 3.213104% 7E 0);??? = Eglhﬁl 7E 0),
where I(-) is the indicator function. 7
Note that, in this framework, (1 —p,1‘f) and 1 — p}? can be
interpreted as estimates of the ‘local’ FDR or Bayesian q-Values
(Newton et al., 2004; Storey and Tibshirani, 2003). Thus, given
a desired global FDR a, we can determine a threshold (15,, to use

threshold ¢a can be determined according to the method pro-
posed by Morris et al. (2008). Let p = (phi: 1, ...,2K) be
the combined vector of posterior probabilities for yM and 3/1”.
We then sort p,- in descending order to obtain p0). Then ([50, = [2(5),

expected proportion of genes found to be signiﬁcant that are
in fact false positive genes is a, in other words, we can control
the average Bayesian FDR to be a.

4 SIMULATION STUDIES

In this section, we examine the operating characteristics of the
proposed iBAG model through synthetic numerical examples.
We use two versions of the iBAG model: an iBAGm-ﬁed model
as speciﬁed in Section 2 and an iBAG2_mge model in which the
mechanistic and clinical models in Equation (1) are fit sequen-
tially. Speciﬁcally, the mechanistic model involves fitting K linear
regressions (for each gene separately). Subsequently, both the
ﬁtted values and the residuals from the mechanistic model are
used as predictors in the clinical model. We use a similar lasso
framework to estimate the clinical model and select genes related
to clinical outcome. In addition, we compare the performance
with those of two other modelsia non-integrative (non-INT)
model and a single gene (SG) model. In the non-INT model,
we ignore the information provided by methylation and fit
only the clinical model with gene expression features (G) as
multivariate explanatory variables. In the SG model, we perform
a multivariate linear regression for each gene separately with all
of the genomic features available (including both mRNA and
methylation levels) for the gene, to conduct selection based on
individual P—Values.

We simulate datasets that reﬂect the application dataset (ana-
lyzed in Section 5) as closely as possible. We fix the total number
of patients at N 2200 and vary the total number of genes
(K = 400, 600, 800, 1000). We assume that J 2200 out of K
genes have had methylation levels measured (the proportion in
the application dataset). Given the triplet, (N, J, K), we first
generate methylation data, mnj, independently from Uniform
(0,1), corresponding to the beta-values of DNA methylation
used in the TCGA glioblastoma study (described in Section 5).
Next, we simulate the gene expression values from a mixture of
two normal distributions, based on the corresponding methyla-
tion measures, i.e. {gk};l gNormal(—l.5mk,a,§) (regulated by
methylation) and {gkﬁf+1 ll~dNormal(0,a,§) (not regulated by
methylation). In the application dataset, ~80% of the correl-
ations between DNA methylations and the corresponding gene
expression levels range from 70.4 to 418. To induce explicit de-
pendence between methylation and gene expression, we assume
01 = - -- = UK and vary the values (= 0.31, 0.44, 0.73) that re-
spectively correspond to gene expression-methylation correl-
ations (p = —0.8, —0.6, —0.4). Finally, we use model (1) to
generate the clinical outcomes Y by settingi(i) y}? :1 for
k=1,7...,20 and J—21,...,J, and 143420 for all other ks;
(ii) 3/11,”: 1 for k=J—21,...,J and J+1, ...,J+20, and
14:” = 0 for all other ks and (iii) 6 ~ NN(0, 0.121NxN). In essence,
we have three groups of genes: group 1 consists of genes with
only a nonzero type M effect, which is the gene expression effect

modulated only by methylation (genes 1720); group 2 consists
of genes with only a non-zero type M effect, which is the gene
expression effect independent of methylation, but modulated by
other mechanisms (gene J + 1 to gene J + 20); and group 3 con-
sists of genes with both nonzero type M and type M effects,
i.e. the gene expression effects modulated (partially) by both
methylation and other mechanisms (gene J —21 to gene J).
In total, we investigate 12 different data combinations based
on variations of (K,p), and we generate 10 datasets for each
combination.

For the non-INT and iBAG2_mge models, we use regular lasso
regression and obtain receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves by varying the shrinkage parameter. For the SG model,
we vary the cutoff of the P—Value for signiﬁcance to obtain the
ROC curves. For the iBAGum-ﬁed model, we obtain the ROC
curve by varying the signiﬁcance threshold for the Bayesian pos-
terior probabilities of the gene expression effects. We ﬁt all four
models, iBAGm-ﬁed, iBAG2_mge, SG and non-INT, to all the
simulated datasets and obtain ROC curves to identify the true
effects of gene expression for the three groups of genes. For each
model, we plot the means of the ROC curves based on the
10 simulated datasets for each (K,p) combination. For example,
in Figure 3, we plot the ROC curves for identifying the true
effects of gene expressions for the three groups of genes when
K: 1000 and p = —0.6, which most closely mimics the real data-
set analyzed in Section 5. Supplementary Table S1 shows the
rank of performance for the four models in identifying the
three groups of genes based on the areas under the ROC
curves (AUC) values. Based on the AUC values, we can conclude
that the iBAGum-ﬁed model outperforms the non-INT, SG and
iBAG2_mge models in identifying all three groups of genes.
Although the iBAG2_mge model performs slightly worse than
the non-INT model in identifying genes with only type M effects
and genes with both type M and type M effects, it has a clear
advantage in identifying genes with only type M effects. The SG
model performs better than the non-INT model in identifying
genes with only type M effects, but it has lower AUCs in iden-
tifying the other two groups of genes. The performances of the
four models in the other 11 scenarios are similar (see
Supplementary Figs S2.17S2.3 for the detection of genes in
groups 173).

Based on the results from all 12 scenarios, the performance of
the four models can be summarized as follows: (i) Our proposed
iBAGum-ﬁed model consistently performs the best of all three
models for discovering all three groups of genes; (ii) The
iBAG2_mge model performs better than the non-INT model
in discovering the genes in group 1, those with effects of gene
expression modulated only by methylation; (iii) In discovering
the genes in groups 2 and 3, the iBAG2_mge model performs as
well as the non-INT model; and (iv) Compared with the
non-INT model, the SG model performs better in identifying
genes in group 1, but worse in identifying genes in the other
two groups.

patients with GBM, along with DNA copy number, mutation,
methylation and gene expression information. Analyzing differ-
ent platforms individually illuminates some of the pathobiologic
features and molecular biomarkers in GBM. For example,
Verhaak et al. (2010) proposed using gene expression data to
develop clinically relevant molecular sub-classiﬁcations of
GBM, and Noushmehr et al. (2010) used methylation levels to
identify a subset of GBM tumors that harbor characteristic pro-
moter DNA methylation alterations, referred to as the glioma
CpG island methylator phenotype.

Here, we focus on integrating gene expression, methylation
data and patients’ clinical features from the GBM study. The
data can be downloaded directly from TCGA’s website (http://
tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaHome2.jsp). The clinical outcome
of interest is the overall survival time. The gene expression proﬁle
is obtained using Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array.
Level 2 data were downloaded from the TCGA website as
of June 2011, and the data were normalized globally using
BrainArray Custom Chip Deﬁnition Files (CDF) and the
Robust Multichip Average (RMA) normalization method.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Pearson correlation and
Ward linkage) and principal components analysis were used to
search for batch effects, but no significant batch effects were
observed. The DNA methylation information is obtained using
the Illumina Human methylation 27 BeadChip. We directly
downloaded the level 3 data from the TCGA website; there are
no significant batch effects (http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.
org/tcgabatcheffects/). For DNA methylation data, we use the
beta value, which is a number between zero and one that meas-
ures the percentage of methylation. For the subsequent analyses,
we brieﬂy outline the data pre—processing steps here for the gene
expression and methylation data. Complete details can be found
in the Supplementary Material (Section S4.1). First, we filter
out the under-expressed genes and the methylation features for
which the beta values do not vary by patient. After this step,
7785 genes and 6890 methylation features remain. Second, we
annotate the 6890 methylation features to the 7785 genes accord-
ing to their positions on the chromosomes. Third, we choose
the top genes based on univariate ﬁltering, adjusting for patient
age. Finally, 1000 genes (348 of them with methylation informa-
tion available) remain for our analysis on 201 patients. Our goal

is not only to understand methylation-based regulation of genes
but also to use this information to ﬁnd signiﬁcant genes asso-
ciated with survival times.

We randomly split the total data from 201 patients into a
training dataset (data from 134 patients) and a test dataset
(data from 67 patients). For the training dataset, we fit the fol-
lowing three models for the selected genes: (i) the non-INT
model, with only gene expression information as explanatory
variables, (ii) the additive (ADD) model, with both gene expres-
sion and methylation information as explanatory variables
and assuming their effects on patients’ survival times are addi-
tive, (iii) the iBAGmﬁed model for censored outcomes, which
integrates both gene expression and methylation information.
We include patient age as a clinical covariate for both the
iBAG and non-INT models. For a fair comparison, we use a
Bayesian approach to obtain estimations for all three models
using double-exponential (lasso) priors. We construct the priors
for the iBAGum-ﬁed model as stated in Section 2.3. The priors for
the non-INT model are the same as those for the iBAGmn-ﬁed
model, except for setting £2 to be 0. The priors for the ADD
model are the same as those in the non-INT model, except for
the priors of the methylation effects, which are set in a manner
similarly to that of the priors for gene expression effects in the
non-INT model. To check the convergence of the iBAGWWd
model, we run two MCMC chains with different starting
values. As seen in the trace plots and the plots based on
Gelman and Rubin’s convergence diagnostic statistics, for the
important parameters in the iBAGmn-ﬁed model (Supplementary
Fig. S5), the results show that the iBAGum-ﬁed model converges
after ~2000 iterations.

To compare the performance of the three models, we obtain
the predicted values for the test dataset using the mean estima-
tions of the parameters from the posterior samples for all three
models. We use the concordance index (C-index) to evaluate
the prediction performance for the different models. The
C:index can be Aexpressed as 2W)“, I(ti, tj)/|d>|, where
I(t,-, tj) = 1 for t,->tj and=0 otherwise, t,- is the estimated sur-
vival time for patient i, and d3 is the set that consists of all pairs
of i, j such that survival time t,—> t]; This measure has been shown
to be effective in comparing prediction performances among
different models for right-censored data (Bonato et al., 2011;

Harrel et al., 2001; van Wieringen et al., 2009). We calculated
C-indexes for the ﬁtted values in the training dataset and the pre-
dicted values in the test dataset for all three models. The results
are summarized in Table 1. The C-indexes for the iBAGm-ﬁed
model are the highest for both the training (0.80) and test data-
sets (0.76). The C-indexes for the non-INT model are the lowest
for both training (0.70) and test datasets (0.73). Although the
improvements by integrating the methylation data are limited
(all 95% CIs of the C-index overlapped for the three models),
the iBAGm-ﬁed model has the best performance in both model
ﬁtting and model prediction.

For the two models performing relatively better in prediction
(iBAGum-ﬁed model and ADD model), we use Gibbs sampling to
obtain posterior samples for the parameters and apply the
method described in Section 3 to obtain the posterior probabil-
ities for the different types of gene expression effects. The
Bayesian posterior probabilities obtained by the iBAG model
for the type M and type M effects are summarized in Figure 4,
panels A and B, respectively. The Bayesian posterior probabil-
ities of the methylation effects and gene expression effects by the
ADD model are summarized in Figure 4, panels C and D,
respectively.

Applying the iBAGum-ﬁed model to the GBM training dataset,
we identify 136 genes (of the total 348 genes with methylation
information) as signiﬁcantly modulated by at least one methyla-
tion feature. These genes are listed in Supplementary Table S3.
Of 136 genes, 102 genes (76%) have a negative estimation for
methylation effects. This result reﬂects the biologic action of
methylation, which usually represses gene expression. At
FDR: 0.2 (corresponding posterior probability cutoff: 0.517),
we obtain 22 genes with non-zero type M effects (effects modu-
lated by methylation) on patient survival using the iBAGunW-ed
model. These genes are listed in the top box of Table 2. We use
an asterisk to show the genes signiﬁcantly modulated by methy-
lation, as identified by the iBAGum-ﬁed model (within the list pro-
vided in Supplementary Table S1). We use a boldface font to
show the genes positively associated with patient survival (higher
expression of the gene indicates longer survival time), and a regu-
lar font to show the genes negatively associated with patient
survival (higher expression of the gene indicate shorter survival
time). In addition, we identify 107 genes with nonzero type M
effects on survival (summarized in the lower box in Table 2).
CNGA3 is the only gene that overlaps between the 22 genes
with type M effects and the 107 genes with type M effects,
which means that CNGA3 is found to have effects modulated
by both methylation and other mechanisms.

Using the ADD model with the same FDR: 0.2 (correspond-
ing posterior probability cutoff: 0.579), we obtain 22 genes that
have signiﬁcant methylation effects and 78 genes that have sig-
niﬁcant gene expression effects on patient survival. By

comparing the gene lists derived by the iBAG and ADD
models using Venn diagrams (Supplementary Figs S41 and
S42), we observe that 59 of 78 genes with significant gene ex-
pression effects obtained by the ADD model overlap with the
genes with non-zero type M effects obtained by the iBAGm-ﬁed
model, and have a directional association with survival time
(both are positive or negative). There are 12 common genes
when comparing the genes with significant methylation effects
by the ADD model and the genes with non-zero type M effects
(effects modulated by methylation). Among the 10 genes with
non-zero type M effects obtained only by the iBAGum-ﬁed model,
five genes (SARMSl, ClQA, UFDlL, CBFB and MVP) are
found to be signiﬁcantly modulated by methylation (see
Supplementary Table S1). However, for the 10 genes with sig-
niﬁcant methylation effects obtained only by the ADD model,
only two of them (ANK3 and IL1 lRA) are found to be signiﬁ-
cantly modulated by methylation (see Supplementary Table S1).
This indicates that for the other eight genes obtained only by the
ADD model, they are shown to have signiﬁcant methylation
effects on survival, but their gene expression levels are not chan-
ged. This result does not seem to conform to our belief that
methylation affects patient survival by depressing the gene ex-
pression. The advantage of the iBAGum-ﬁed model is that it can

identify the genes with effects modulated by methylation, and
thus the results are more biologically interpretable.

Of the 22 genes identiﬁed by effects modulated by methyla-
tion, 14 are negatively associated with survival, whereas eight
genes are positively associated with survival. Functional analysis
with the database for annotation, Visualization and integrated
discovery (DAVID, Dennis et al., 2003) revealed that some of
the genes that are negatively associated with survival are regula-
tors of transcription (SMURF2, HOXAl, RBBP4 and
POLR3C) and code for plasma membrane (CAP2, GPR116,
SMURF2). Detailed results and additional discussions can be
found in Supplementary Table S5.1. This gene set related with
negative survival is enriched for Gene Ontology terms, cell mor-
phogenesis and neuron differentiation, suggesting a probable
role in the genesis of brain tumors. On the other hand, the effects
of genes associated with positive survival are mostly intra-cellular
and are related to immune systems processes (ClQA, CBFB,
DPP4 and SARMl), suggesting a likely function in tumor sup-
pression (see Supplementary Table S5.2). Although no GBM
studies have so far identiﬁed these 22 genes as important bio-
markers of survival, two of the genes in this list are associated
with other types of gliomaiMVP was found to be overexpressed
in ganglio-gliomas (Aronica et al., 2003). Moreover, most of the
genes in this list have important biological functions in other
types of cancer. For example, HOXAl stimulates oncogenesis
through the MAPK signaling pathway and the transcription
factors STAT3 and STAT5B in mammary epithelial cells
(Mohankumar et al., 2008). Also, CpG islands of HOXAl are
significantly hypermethylated in lung cancer (Selamat et al.,
2011), breast cancer (Park et al., 2011) and gastric carcinoma
(Kang et al., 2008).

6 DISCUSSION

In this article, we introduce an innovative model, iBAG, to in-
tegrate two different platforms of omics data and estimate their
associations with clinical outcome. Different from most existing
integration approaches, which focus on either finding biological
relationships among different platforms or predicting patient
prognosis, our iBAG model involves a hierarchical structure,
which simultaneously estimates biological mechanisms and uses

this information to ﬁnd signiﬁcant prognostic genes. Our simu-
lation study shows that the iBAG model can simultaneously in-
crease the power and decrease the FDR in detecting clinically
relevant genes, especially for genes with expression effects modu-
lated only by methylation. Moreover, we can categorize all clin-
ically relevant genes into three groups according to different
biological mechanisms: genes with expression effects modulated
only by methylation, genes with expression effects modulated
only by other mechanisms and genes with expression effects
modulated by both methylation and other mechanisms. We
apply the iBAG model to integrate methylation data and gene
expression data from TCGA’s GBM dataset. The results show
that the iBAG model outperforms the model based on data from
a single layer of biological information in both determining genes
important to survival and model ﬁtting.

The main goal of the iBAG model is to (i) identify more
disease-associated genes, and (ii) achieve better predictive
power, by treating gene expression as the downstream event
that is regulated by different mechanisms (e.g. methylation,
copy number and microRNA). We choose to treat the gene ex-
pression as a downstream event regulated by different mechan-
isms so that the iBAG model can help us identify more
disease-associated genes. There are several reasons underlying
this choice. First, acknowledging that a gene’s expression can
be modulated by different mechanisms (e.g. methylation, copy
number and microRNA), even if these mechanisms do not have
a direct effect on survival, we can still identify genes whose
modulated expressions potentially impact survival. Second, as
the measure of gene expression from microarray technology is
usually noisy, iBAG can effectively identify, which part of the
gene expression is actually modulated by various factors from
other platforms, thus denoising the expression to ﬁnd prognostic
genes. In addition, as shown by our analysis of the GBM data, if
we simply use methylation information additively to gene expres-
sion to estimate the methylation effects on patient survival, we
ﬁnd that many methylation effects related to survival do not
signiﬁcantly change the gene expression levels. The iBAG
model can help us eliminate these genes and obtain results that
are more biologically interpretable.

As our main goal is to identify important genes associated with
patient survival, we assume that the methylation effect on gene

expression and the gene expression effect on patient survival are
all linear and independent. By making this assumption, the con-
ditional posterior distributions are in closed forms, which save us
on computation cost. However, this assumption may not reﬂect
the true biological process; therefore, if the main interest is to
make predictions about clinical outcome, then more general
forms of functions (e.g. non-parametric functions) may need to
be considered. In our study, we focus on finding purely associ-
ational relationships between genes and patients’ survival times.
Independent functional experiments and datasets are needed to
validate any causal relationships or implications. In addition,
although our implementation is Bayesian, the fundamental idea
of the integrative hierarchical modeling can be applied using
frequentist approaches as well. Although we illustrate the inte-
gration of only two platforms at a time, integrating three or more
platforms can also be done by following a similar framework.
This will require a deeper understanding of the fundamental bio-
logical relationships among different data platforms. We leave
these tasks for future consideration. The iBAG model provides a
useful and intuitive framework for integrating multiple platforms
to improve diagnosis and prognosis in cancer. A freely available
R software for the iBAG model is available under the ‘software’
link at: http://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/ ~Vbaladan/.

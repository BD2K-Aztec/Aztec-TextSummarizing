ABSTRACT

Motivation: Early and accurate detection of human pathogen
infection is critical for treatment and therapeutics. Here we describe
pathogen identification using short RNA subtraction and assembly
(SRSA), a detection method that overcomes the requirement of prior
knowledge and culturing of pathogens, by using degraded small
RNA and deep sequencing technology. We prove our approach’s
efficiency through identification of a combined viral and bacterial
infection in human cells.

1 INTRODUCTION

Early and accurate detection of microbial pathogens in both clinical
and environmental samples is critical for effective public health
care, treatment and therapeutics. Most pathogen detection methods
[polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampliﬁcation or microarrays]
rely on prior knowledge of the exact sequence of the potential
pathogen, or the ability to cultivate the pathogen (for microbial
cultures), which is unreasonable in many cases (Douglas, 2005;
Straub et (11., 2005). An alternative detection technique recently
offered, which circumvents these limitations, is the sequencing of
infected cells and the subsequent comparison of these sequences
to a reference pathogen library for identiﬁcation (MacConaill
et al., 2008). Given the massive increase in nucleic acid sequence
databases of all organisms, and the advancement in massive parallel
sequencing technologies, sequencing possibly infected samples
evolves as an increasingly prominent and logical alternative for
pathogen characterization. The major advantages of this approach
are the unbiased detection of all known pathogens, overcoming the
requirement for cultivation of slow-growing and fastidious microbial
agents; the ability to recognize pathogens, even at minute expression
levels; simultaneous identiﬁcation of several microbial agents in a
co-infected sample; and the rapid turnaround and processing.

2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Here we introduce a novel approach for pathogen detection using
short reads, generated by deep sequencing of short RNA extracts.
This three step approach includes: (i) alignment of the short
reads against the human reference genome; (ii) subtraction and
assembly of the remaining unmapped reads; and (iii) categorization

and identiﬁcation of the pathogen infection, based on nucleic
acid databases. We term our approach short RNA subtraction
and assembly (SRSA). We applied our method to Human
Immunodeﬁciency Virus (HIV) infected cells, precisely identifying
the infected cells and the infecting agents.

In order to identify minute quantities of non-host organisms,
we chose to analyze RNA in sizes that maximize the pathogen-to-
host nucleotide ratio. Utilizing small RNA (20—50 nt) for pathogen
detection, rather than the currently used cDNA and ESTs (Weber
et al., 2002), has several apparent advantages. Speciﬁc short RNA
extracts provide a larger pathogen-to-host ratio than DNA samples
since host DNA is usually several orders of magnitude larger than
pathogen DNA/RNA, and thus much more abundant in the sample.
An increased non-host RNA quantity is achieved due to a higher
RNA degradation rate in bacteria (Rauhut et al., 1999) and the
presence of fragmented viral sequences (due to RNA interference)
(Obbard et al., 2009) leading to prevalent bacterial and viral RNA
at lower molecular weights. Unambiguous mapping of short RNAs
to the human genome is preferred to circumvent splicing events
of longer transcripts, since the proportion of reads spanning splice
junctions is minute. This also increases our conﬁdence in the
unmapped reads being derived from non-human origin. Finally, short
RNA extraction excludes the highly abundant host RNA species (e.g
rRNA and tRNA) that can potentially over-cloud non-short RNA
experiments.

All infected tissue contains nucleic acids from both the host and
the infecting agent. It has been shown that mapping long sequence
reads from a transcript sample against the human genome and
analyzing the non-human reads has the potential of identifying
non-human pathogen genes (Xu et al., 2003). These transcript
subtraction methods utilize thousands of long sequence reads
(>200 nt), produced by stande Sanger sequencing or Roche
454 sequencer. They were not, however, applied on reads shorter
than 200 nt, like the ones produced by currently more common
sequencing platforms, such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer or
HiSeq 2000, that produce millions of short reads (<100 nt) in a
single run (Voelkerding et al., 2009).

Methods utilizing short RNA sequencing and assembly were
previously applied mainly for viral detection and classiﬁcation
in plants and invertebrates. Kreuze et al. (2009) sequenced and
assembled viral small RNA in sweet potato without the need for
subtraction of the host-derived sequences. However, this method
would not suit mammalian samples, as skipping the subtraction
step could result in excess of, or over-clouding by, host-derived
reads (>90%). Briese et a1. (2009) selected larger RNA products
(>70 bp) from clinical samples taken from human serum and tissue
and, following assembly, they were able to detect and classify a new

strain of infecting Arenavirus. However, the majority of their viral
sequences were obtained from the serum sample, where competing
cellular abundant RNA species are absent. This approach would
likely reduce the pathogen-to-host-ratio in non-serum samples and as
a consequence limit detection sensitivity. Wu et (11. (2010) applied an
approach termed ‘vdSAR’ to assemble previously sequenced small
RNA libraries from invertebrates, in order to both demonstrate their
sequence overlap, and to classify the infecting viral agents. However,
dealing with mammalian genomes and a large number of sequencing
reads (>10 million) necessitates a host-based sequence subtraction
step for increasing accuracy. Thus, our approach is unique, as we
utilize short RNA subtraction and assembly in mammalian-derived
cells, to maximize pathogen-to-host-ratio; demonstrate recognition
of both viral and bacterial infecting agents; and suggest a possible
siRNA-related immune response.

Short sequence reads present a confounding problem of multiple
organisms’ alignment (Trapnell et (11., 2009a) and thus inconclusive
identiﬁcation of the organisms. In order to identify the non-human
sequences and target to which organism it aligns, we applied
de novo sequencing (sequence assembly), using an assembly
software [Velvet (Zerbino et (11., 2008)] to produce longer consensus
sequences from our given short read sample. These longer assembled
reads were then compared to known organisms’ references [using
BLAST (Dumontier et (11., 2002)] to produce high scoring unique
alignments and thus a valid and conclusive identiﬁcation, which
could not have been reached otherwise.

We used cell line infected with Human Immunodeﬁciency Virus 1
(HIV-1; see Section 2). Using an alignment software [Burrows-
Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (Li and Durbin, 2009)], we aligned the
reads produced by our sequencing platform against the human
reference genome. Our sequencing produced >10 million reads for
each sample, with an average read length of 34 nt. Filtering the
human genome-associated reads produced 6% and 17% unmapped
reads in the HIV-1 negative and positive samples, respectively.

In order to reduce the number of multiple organism hits we
expect when matching such short reads against a large database,
we assembled each read groups into longer contigs. The assembly
process produced 16 and 878 contigs, with an average length of 75
and 91 nt for the HIV-1 negative and positive samples, respectively.
As we expected, the assembly process was far more productive
in the HIV-1 positive sample than the negative one, due to the
presence of more speciﬁc non-human organisms’ sequences. We
then used NCBI’s megablast to match these contigs against any
known organism. Megablast was chosen since it is an optimal tool for
identical sequence detection for both short and long sequences. Since
our goal was not to ﬁnd homologous sequences but rather to detect
the most probable and speciﬁc sequence in the nucleotide database,
megablast was preferred over other optional tools. Using an in-house
speciﬁc software (available upon request), we incorporated only the
highest scoring hits in the downstream analysis, and ﬁltered out
non-unique organism hits, meaning that any contig that matched
more than one organism was discarded. We also set the combined
E-value of all unique hits to be 1*ET200 at most (See Section 2 for
more detail). After applying these ﬁlters to the Blastn results, we
could not identify any non-human organism in the HIV-1 negative
sample. In the HIV-1 positive sample, however, we identiﬁed two
non-human organisms: HIV-1 and Mycoplasma Hyorhinis HUB-1
(Table 1). We then further analyzed the distribution of hits matching
any HIV strain, ﬁnding the strain accumulating the highest number

of hits was, in fact, the exact strain used to infect the sample
(HIV-HXB2; Table 2). To conﬁrm the detection of Mycoplasma
in our HIV-1-infected sample, we used a stande Mycoplasma test
kit (Fig. 1), followed by a PCR and a sequencing conﬁrmation that
veriﬁed the Mycoplasma strain was indeed of the Hyorhinis strain.
The detection of Mycoplasma and HIV-1 validates the accuracy and
sensitivity of our method in identifying both intracellular viral agents
and environmental bacterial contaminants, in the same given sample.

In addition to the efﬁcient detection of HIV in our sample,
sequencing data coverage analysis showed that when mapping our
human-alignment unmapped reads against HIV reference genome,
87% of the bases were covered with an average coverage of 18
reads . This comprehensive read depth could be utilized for further
phylogenetic, strain and mutation analysis, relevant in microbial
detection and research (Wang et (11., 2007).

Due to the decrease in cost and increase in efﬁciency of deep
sequencing platforms, we expect sequencing utilization in the ﬁeld
of pathogen detection and identiﬁcation to increase. Our method,
based on using small RNA, to increase the pathogen-to-host ratio,
proves to be a useful tool for microbial identiﬁcation and detection.
Our computational approach of subtraction and assembly (SRSA)
presents an easily implemented pipeline, appropriate for all types

of current sequencing platforms. We envision early and accurate
detection of pathogen infection, using short RNA reads to accelerate
clinical biomedical investigation.

3 METHODS

3.1 Sample preparation

SupTl cells (human. Caucasian. pleural effusion. lymphoma. T cell) were
infected with HIV-1 (HXB2 strain) on day 0. Four days post-infection. ~50%
of naive cells were added to the cultures. and 4 days later they were harvested.
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). and 10 [Lg of
each sample were prepared for deep sequencing following Illumina’s small
RNA sample preparation protocol v1. Brieﬂy. samples were ligated with
3’ and 5’ adapters. reverse transcribed and then PCR ampliﬁed. cDNA
library was prepared from 93 to 100 bp PCR products. and sequenced in
separate lanes on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx instrument at the Tel
Aviv University Genome High-Throughput Sequencing Laboratory.

3.2 Alignment and assembly

The sequenced reads were clipped for the standard short RNA adapter. using
fastx clipper (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/). discarding all reads
<16 nt. Our sequencing method produced 21 048 677 and 12 003 830 reads
after clipping for HIV-1 negative and positive samples. respectively. We
then aligned the reads using BWA alignment software (using the default
parameters) against the human genome (hg19) reference. retrieved from
NCBI. We re-aligned our positive sample using TopHat (Trapnell et (11..
2009b). which considers splice junctions in the alignment process. to test
the confounding effect of splice junctions presence on our results. Since
BWA demonstrated higher mapping accuracy (83% as opposed to 78% using
TopHat). all downstream analysis was conducted on its output. Filtering the
human genome-associated reads produced 1251267 (6%) and 1992 557
(16.6%) unmapped reads in the HIV-1 negative and positive samples.
respectively. The unmapped reads were then assembled. using Velvet’s
AssemblyAssembler (v1.3). which conducts assemblies with predeﬁned
parameter values across a user-speciﬁed range of k-mer values. followed
by utilization of the contigs from all previous assemblies. as input for a ﬁnal
assembly. We ran the script with a wide range of hash lengths of 9731 nt in
order to optimize the length of the contigs. The most effective length was
found to be within the range of 17 to 25 nt. The assembly produced 16 and
878 contigs with an average length of 75 and 91 nt for the HIV-1 negative

and positive samples. respectively. The difference in the amount of produced
reads can be accounted for by the lack of non-human-associated sequences
in the negative sample.

3.3 Categorization and identiﬁcation

The assembled contigs were then aligned. using NCBI’s nucleotide
megablast with a word size of 28. against the ‘All non-redundant GenBank
CDS translations+PDB+SwissProt+PIR+PRF’ database. with an inclusion
threshold E-value of 0.01. Using an in-house developed software (available
upon request). we included only the highest ranking hits (with lowest E-value
and highest total score) per query for the downstream analysis. Using the blast
results. we produced an organism table for each sample. Unique organism
hits were added. when all the highest ranking included hits per query matched
only a single organism [organism taxonomy retrieved using NCBI’s E-utils
(http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and taxonomy database]. Multiple hits were
counted for each organism matched per query. The organism’s total E-value
was calculated by multiplying the E-value of all the unique hits (E -value is
nearly identical to P-values for E <0.01). To account for the multiple hits
in the blast results. we also calculated an organism total score. by summing
the score for each unique organism hit with the score for each multiple hit.
divided by the number of different organisms per query. This summation
approach did not increase our interspecies differentiation capabilities. since
different species could have a different number of strains and annotations. It
was. however. utilized in our intraspecies analysis. prioritizing the different
strains (Table 2). Deciding on a standard of maximum total E-value of
1*E‘200. no organism was identiﬁed in the HIV-1 negative sample. the
most prominent was Homo sapiens with nine unique hits. In the HIV-1
positive sample. four organisms were identiﬁed. one of which was Homo
sapiens. the other three were Mycoplasma Hyorhinis HUB-1. Human
Immunodeﬁciency Virus 1 and Mycoplasma Hyorhinis. While optimizing
our method. we found that its sensitivity was very high. detecting both
infecting agents and host-related sequences with very high certainty. and
an extremely low E :0. We also observed that the number of different
taxonomies passing the basic ﬁlter of having the highest query score and
lowest E-value was very high. demonstrating a low speciﬁcity rate. Out of
385 different taxonomies passing the basic ﬁlter. 14 were Mycoplasma out
of which 3 were of the Hyorhinis strain. There were also 19 different human
immunodeﬁciency virus taxonomies and 1 Homo sapiens. Counting only
the Hyorhinis. HIV-1 and Homo sapiens as true positives (true positive rate;
TPR=0.06). our method demonstrated a false positive rate (FPR) of 0.94.
We then sought to implement more rigorous inclusion criteria to reduce the
FPR. while maintaining high sensitivity. Setting our inclusion criteria to only
include taxonomies that have unique query hits. resulted in eight different
taxonomies. one of which is Homo sapiens. one HIV-1 and four Mycoplasma
out of which two are Hyorhinis reaching an FPR of 0.5. We then added a
maximal E-value threshold equal to 1*E‘200. which resulted in only four
taxonomies remaining. all of which are true positives. with Mycoplasma
Arginini being the closest taxonomy for inclusion with 4*E‘Igl. We also
noticed that the total score. calculated by dividing each query score against
the number of taxonomies it hits and summing it for each taxonomy. could
also serve as a reliable ﬁltration standard. though further tests are required.

3.4 Mycoplasma conﬁrmation

To conﬁrm the detection of a Mycoplasma contamination in our HIV-1-
infected sample. we used EZ-PCR Mycoplasma test kit (Biological
Industries. Beit-Ha’Emek) on the samples (50 ng in 50 [L1 reaction
volume) following High-Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit with random
primers (Applied Biosystems) (1 [Lg RNA in 15 [L1 total reaction volume).
The products were separated in Agarose gel (Fig. 1). and bands
were excised from the gel using Wizard SV Gel Clean-Up System
(Promega). Conﬁrmation sequencing was done using the forward primer 5’-
GGGAGCAAACAGGATTAGATACCCT—3’. This conﬁrmation strengthens
our methods’ ﬁdelity. since Mycoplasma is indeed present in the sample.

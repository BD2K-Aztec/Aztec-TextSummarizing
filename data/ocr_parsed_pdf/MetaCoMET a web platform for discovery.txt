Abstract

Motivation: A key component of the analysis of microbiome datasets is the identification of OTUs
shared between multiple experimental conditions, commonly referred to as the core microbiome.
Results: We present a web platform named MetaCoMET that enables the discovery and visualiza—
tion of the core microbiome and provides a comparison of the relative abundance and diversity
patterns between subsets of samples within a microbiome dataset. MetaCoMET provides an effi—
cient and interactive graphical interface for analyzing each subset defined by the union or disjunc—
tion of groups within the Venn diagram, and includes a graphical taxonomy summary, alpha diver—
sity metrics, Principal Coordinate analysis, abundance—based heatmaps, and a chart indicating the
geographic distribution of each sample.

Availability and Implementation: MetaCoMET is a user—friendly and efficient web platform
freely accessible at http://pr0bes.pw.usda.g0v/MetaCoMET 0r http://aegilops.wheat.ucdavis.edu/

1 Introduction

A common goal in amplicon-based microbiome analysis is the iden-
tification of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that are either
shared between or distinct among multiple experimental conditions
(treatments, environments, time points, etc.). The term core micro-
biome has been used to describe these shared microbes (Hamady
and Knight, 2009; Turnbaugh, et (11., 2007) and is typically defined
as the set of OTUs common among the microbial communities from
different but related conditions or habitats. Commonly occurring
components within complex microbial assemblages are of interest
for a variety of reasons, and may well be critical to the general func-
tion of those communities (Shade and Handelsman, 2012).
Although some web tools, like METAREP, SILVAngs and VAMPS
provide analysis and visualization functions for microbiome data-
sets, they provide limited tools for the identification of the core

microbiome and these tools focus primarily on the presence or ab-
sence of OTUs within the data.

Here, we present a web platform named MetaCoMET that en-
ables the easy discovery and visualization of the core microbiome
using one of three alternative methods and the comparison of rela-
tive abundance and diversity patterns for subsets of the data as
defined by the core analysis.

2 Methods

As an extension and application of the ideas presented by Shade and
Handelsman (Shade and Handelsman, 2012), we employ three
standard methods (membership, composition, persistence) that can
be used to define the core microbiome.

The Membership method is the simplest and most commonly
used method for determining the core microbiome using an OTU

table, and is based on the presence and absence of OTUs among the
different microbiomes being compared (Supplementary Fig. S1A). If
an OTU is observed at a level greater than the user—specified abso—
lute or relative abundance threshold within any of the samples repre—
senting a specific group, it is counted as being a member of that
group. This method is helpful for cases when the minimal member—
ship core is expected to be small, or when the presence of a microbe
alone may indicate a shift in microbiome function, for instance in
the detection of microbe—mediated disease.

The Composition method places OTUs within the Venn dia—
gram based on relative abundance, rather than presence/absence
(Supplementary Fig. 51B). In this method, each OTU is automatic—
ally assigned membership to the group for which it has the highest
relative abundance, and membership in other groups is assigned if
the relative abundance of that OTU is similar as defined by a user—
specified threshold. This method ensures that every OTU will be
included in the final analysis, and will only appear in a single over—
lap within the Venn diagram. This method of analysis may be help—
ful when there is a large or complete overlap in OTUs that are
observed across different groups, but also substantial differences in
the relative abundance of these OTUs in the groups being compared
that could drive important functional differences.

The Persistence method enables the identification of OTUs that
are consistently detected within a microbiome experiment (Shade
and Handelsman, 2012). In this method, we consider that the OTU
should be present within a user—specified fraction of the samples
within the group, in order to be counted as belonging to that group
(Supplementary Fig. 51C). This method can be useful for tracking
OTUs that are stable across experimental replication, or across time
in longitudinal studies.

After applying the methods described above for core microbiome
discovery, MetaCoMET generates a new OTU table for each over—
lapping region of the Venn diagram, and allows for interactive visual
exploration of these OTU tables through commonly used statistical
techniques. Example analyses that help illustrate the utility of
MetaCoMET are available for data from a recent study of the rice
microbiome (Edwards et al., 2015).

3 Results

As input, the MetaCoMET analysis accepts an OTU table in BIOM
(The Biological Observation Matrix) format (both versions 1.0 or 2.0
supported) containing community abundance data (McDonald et al.,
2012). The OTU table can be filtered by OTU or sample abundance,
using either an absolute or relative threshold, which allows the user
the option of removing low—abundance taxa and samples.
Additionally, MetaCoMET allows for prefiltering by OTU taxonomic
terms, which enables the user to focus on or exclude OTUs matching
specific key words in downstream analysis. MetaCoMET also allows
users to normalize their data to account for differences in read depths
across their samples or to prefilter their data based on phylogenetic re—
latedness to collapse closely related OTUs into new lineages.
MetaCoMET has an efficient and interactive graphical interface
that will generate a Venn diagram viewer (Supplementary Fig. S2)
using jvenn (Bardou et al., 2014) for comparing between two to six
user—defined groups within their microbiome data. In addition,
MetaCoMET provides functionality for analyzing both the overall
dataset, as well as each subset defined by the union or disjunction of
groups within the Venn diagram. This functionality utilizes preexist—
ing tools to create a graphical taxonomy summary (Ondov et al.,
2011) (Supplementary Fig. S3), abundance—based heatmaps (Skuta

et al., 2014) (Supplementary Fig. S4), Principal Coordinate analysis
(Vazquez—Baeza et al., 2013) (Supplementary Fig. SSA), alpha diver—
sity metrics (Caporaso et al., 2010) (Supplementary Fig. SSE), a chart
of the geographic distributions of each sample (Supplementary Fig.
S6), and a built—in search for identifying keywords within the OTU
table (Supplementary Fig. S7). MetaCoMET also integrates the re—
cently publish tool Phinch (Bik, 2014) in the analysis result, adding al—
ternative visualization features including bubble charts, Sankey
diagrams and donut partitions (Supplementary Fig. S8), and has been
optimized and validated for use with the Google Chrome browser.

4 Conclusion

The interactive Venn diagram viewer in MetaCoMET provides a
high—level summary of shared and unique OTUs, as well as the most
commonly needed visualization features for comparative exploration
of the data. As input, MetaCoMET only requires users to upload a
standard OTU table in BIOM file format and to define group mem—
bership, and importantly allows the core microbiome analysis to be
performed quickly and without the need to install programs locally.
As such, MetaCoMET provides researchers with a powerful tool with
low overhead for analyzing and interpreting the biological meaning of
microbiome data and enhancing ecological understanding.

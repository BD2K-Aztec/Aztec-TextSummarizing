Abstract

Motivation: Systems biology models can be used to test new hypotheses formulated on the basis
of previous knowledge or new experimental data, contradictory with a previously existing model.
New hypotheses often come in the shape of a set of possible regulatory mechanisms. This search
is usually not limited to finding a single regulation link, but rather a combination of links subject to
great uncertainty or no information about the kinetic parameters.

Results: In this work, we combine a logic—based formalism, to describe all the possible regulatory
structures for a given dynamic model of a pathway, with mixed—integer dynamic optimization
(MIDO). This framework aims to simultaneously identify the regulatory structure (represented by
binary parameters) and the real—valued parameters that are consistent with the available experi—
mental data, resulting in a logic—based differential equation model. The alternative to this would be
to perform real—valued parameter estimation for each possible model structure, which is not tract—
able for models of the size presented in this work. The performance of the method presented here
is illustrated with several case studies: a synthetic pathway problem of signaling regulation, a two—
component signal transduction pathway in bacterial homeostasis, and a signaling network in liver
cancer cells.

1 Introduction

 

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the application
of logic formalisms to systems biology, and in particular to
model signal transduction (Albert and Thakar, 2014; Samaga and
Klamt, 2013). The basis of this model formalism lies in the assump-
tion that cells process information of certain stimuli approximately
by logic circuits, and their simplicity makes then] particularly amen-
able to model large networks and integrate pathway knowledge

from databases with high-throughput data (Blinov and Moraru,
2012)

Logic models were first introduced by Kauffman (1969) to
model gene regulatory networks. Since then, diverse modifications
from the original formalism were developed. In particular various
extensions have been developed to accommodate continuous values
(e.g. Aldridge et (11., 2009; Bernardo—Faura et (11., 2014; Bonneau
et (11., 2006, de Jong, 2002; Mendoza and Xenarios, 2006).

Amongst these formalisms, logic—based ordinary differential equa—
tions (ODEs) are well suited to handle time series in a precise man—
ner. The main idea is to transform the logic model into a continuous
homologue in the form of ODEs. Since it is based on a logic circuit,
this formalism does not require information about the biochemistry
(e.g. stoichiometry or type of kinetics), and at the same time, since it
provides a model of differential equations, we can accurately per—
form dynamic simulations for the state variables trajectories. Several
methods have been proposed in the literature to transform Boolean
logic model into ODE approximations (Bonneau et al., 2006;
Mendoza and Xenarios, 2006). CellNOpt, relies in multivariate
polynomial interpolation introduced by Wittmann et al. (2009).

Logic formalisms have been used to reverse engineer biochemical
networks from data, i.e. to obtain a mechanistic dynamic model
from time—series data. One early example is the work by Akutsu
et al. (1999) which proposed a brute force approach that infers the
Boolean function of a few top k regulators, node by node. Other
methods treat these networks in a global manner (instead of fitting
logic functions node by node) borrowing ideas from optimization
and machine learning to avoid excessive model complexity
(Bonneau et al., 2006; Saez-Rodriguez et al., 2009). In San-
Rodriguez et al. (2009) networks derived from of prior knowledge,
from e.g. public repositories of manually curated networks, are
expanded into a hypergraph, where all the possible logic gates are
represented and optimization strategies are used to find which net—
works could best reproduce the data with the smallest number of
hyperedges. This method is implemented in the software CellNOpt
(Terfve et al., 2012) for various logic formalisms and is designed to
reverse engineer Boolean models, mainly in a protein signaling envir—
onment, given data from perturbation experiments.

Here, we present a mixed—integer global optimization approach
for the problem of reverse engineering signaling and regulatory net—
works as logic—based ODEs from a source of prior—knowledge con—
taining multiple possible regulation links and experimental data.
The problem of identifying the logic gates is formulated as a simul—
taneous model selection and parameter identification problem.
From the optimization point of view, this corresponds to a mixed
integer dynamic optimization (MIDO) problem. Although MIDO
problems are typically hard, we show that solutions can be achieved
for rather complex networks by applying global optimization meta—
heuristics.

Only a few authors have considered the use of mixed—integer
nonlinear programming for reverse engineering purposes. Sambo
et al. (2012) proposed the algorithm mixed optimization for reverse
engineering (MORE), which consists in a bi—level optimization
where the discrete (binary) level communicates with the continuous
(NLP) level and vice versa. For model representation, a structured
formalism, formally identical to dynamic recurrent neural networks,
is used. Guillén-Gosélbez et al. (2013) have presented a determinis—
tic method for identification of regulatory structure and kinetic par—
ameters in biochemical networks, transforming the MIDO problem
into an approximated large—scale MINLP, which was then solved by
a nonlinear branch and bound method. To avoid local minima the
authors provided high quality initial solutions to the solver. These
solutions were obtained by solving a set of relaxed problems from
different starting points. Despite these advances, the major draw—
back of deterministic global methods is that the computational
effort increases very rapidly with problem size. More recently,
Rodriguez-Fernandez et al. (2013) have shown how to apply mixed
integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) to perform simultaneous
model discrimination and parameter estimation in dynamic models
of cellular systems.

This paper is organized as follows: first, we present the formula—
tion of the mixed—integer dynamic optimization problem making use
of logic—based dynamic models. Then we present a solution strategy
based on global optimization metaheuristics. Next, the performance
and capabilities of the new approach are illustrated with several
reverse engineering case studies: a synthetic pathway of signaling
regulation, a signal transduction pathway in bacterial homeostasis,
and a signaling pathway in live cancer cells. Finally, the main con—
clusions are outlined.

2 Methods

2.1 Logic—based ordinary differential equation models
Logic models describe the flow of information inside the cell by
means of discrete states (logic decisions) that can assume either the
values 0 or 1. Each state x, E {0.1} is, therefore, represented by a
binary variable that is systematically updated according to a
Boolean function B,(xi1,xiz, ...,xiN) E {0.1} of its N inputs (x,,). As
an example, consider the case where a specific protein is to be phos—
phorylated in two sites by different kinases, and both phosphoryl—
ations are required to activate the protein. This can be modeled as a
logic conjunction (AND gate). In contrast, if two different kinases
can phosphorylate the same site activating the propagation of the
downstream signaling independently, this can be regarded as a logic
disjunction (OR gate). Furthermore, if a signal inhibits the
propagation of another one, this can be depicted as a negation
(NOT gate).

If one uses only AND/OR/NOT gates, logic models can be
represented using a hypergraph structure (incidence matrix).
In this case, a hyperedge with more than one input represents
and AND gate, and OR gates are encoded by multiple hyperedges
arriving at a given node. The idea in logic—based ODE models is
to convert each Boolean update function into a continuous
homologue B, E [0.1], where the species E, E [0.1] is allowed to
take continuous values between 0 and 1, and its temporal behavior
is described by:

| H

xi: "(§i(fi17§i27m7§ij)—Ei) (1)

1

H

where r,- can be interpreted as the life—time of the species x,.

In order to achieve a continuous homologue, Wittmann et al.
(2009) introduced HillCubes. These functions are based on multi—
variate polynomial interpolation and incorporate Hill kinetics,
which are known to provide a good generalized approximation of
the synergistic dynamics of gene regulation.

To obtain HillCubes, a first transformation method is required
to reach a continuous homologue from the Boolean update function.
Table 1 provides an example on how an OR gate would be

Table 1. The relationship between the OR Boolean update function
B(x1,x2) and its continuous homologue B’(Y1,Y2), obtained by
multivariate polynomial interpolation (Wittmann et al., 2009), is

combining global stochastic methods with efficient (local) determin—
istic optimization methods (Banga et al., 2004; Rodriguez-
Fernandez et al., 2006a). In this context, metaheuristics (i.e. guided
heuristics) have been particularly successful, ensuring the proper
solution of these problems by adopting a global optimization
approach, while keeping the computational effort under reasonable
values thanks to efficient local optimization solvers (Rodriguez-
Fernandez et al., 2006b).

In this work, we have chosen a recent metaheuristic based on the
combination of an enhanced scatter search (eSS) method as global
solver (Egea et al., 2010) with a Mixed—Integer Sequential Quadratic
Programming (MISQP) (Exler et al., 2012) local solver. eSS is an
evolutionary algorithm for complex—process optimization that
employs some elements of scatter search and path relinking. MISQP
is a trust region sequential quadratic programming solver adapted to
solve MINLP problems. In this code, instead of solving continuous
quadratic programs, the solution is approximated by a series of
mixed—integer convex quadratic programming problems. In add—
ition, MISQP accepts black—box problems and, thus, does not
require the problem to be transformed into an algebraic form, a typ—
ical requirement of most MINLP methods. As shown below, we
compared the performance of eSS with two other modern metaheur—
istics, ACOmi (Ant—Colony for Mixed Integer) (Schlﬁter et al.,
2009) and MITS (Mixed—Integer Tabu Search) (Exler et al., 2008).
For the class of problems considered here, we found that eSS consist—
ently provided the best results.

2.4 A multi—phase scatter search with relaxed MlNLPs
The MIDO problem formulated above is extremely challenging to
solve. Although the initial results obtained with the enhanced scatter
search (eSS) method (Egea et al., 2010) were promising, a second
objective of this work was to improve the algorithm in terms of con—
vergence speed while keeping robustness in order to ensure a good
scale—up for realistic applications. For this purpose, we have devised
a multi—phase scatter search (MPeSS) strategy which, in a first phase,
computes intermediate solutions of relaxed MINLPs and, in a
second phase, uses them as initial points for solving the original
MINLP.

In order to reformulate a relaxed problem, we consider each
hyperedge to be associated with a continuous weight instead of a
binary variable. Each weight will appear as an additional term in its
corresponding minterm from the truth table. When several weights
affect a single minterm, then we can apply the multivariate polyno—
mial interpolation of an OR gate. Table 2 and Figure 1 illustrate the
problem formulation where variables E1 and E2 represent two differ—
ent inputs: only W1 activates Y; only W2 activates Y; W1 and W2 are
required to activate Y.

Table 2. Truth table with weights representing the presence of
hyperedges in a continuous formulation for the graph shown in
Figure 1

O 1 w1‘(1—Y1)‘Y2+

1 O w2‘31‘(1—Y2)+

1 1 OR(LU1,LU2,LU3)‘71‘72

 

Note: The multivariate polynomial interpolation of the OR gate is used to
make a smooth approximation of a logical disjunction for the weights wl, w;
and W3.

When solutions are of a binary nature this formulation holds
exactly the same solution as the previously shown for the mixed
integer nonlinear case. So far, this reformulation produces an over—
parameterized problem which does meet the basic constraint that
each hyperedge can only be present or not present. Thus, to enforce
that solutions for to tend to be of a binary nature, we add a penalty.
The objective function to be minimized becomes:

where pm, is the penalty associated with the deviation of each w,
from the nearest binary value (0 or 1).

The usage of this relaxed formulation to find MIDO solutions
can be summarized as follows:

° In a ﬁrst phase, we solve the relaxed problem with a small or null
penalty value to ﬁnd a set of continuous parameters, which are
able to describe the data well.

° The solution found in the previous iteration is used to restart eSS
with a given or. Depending on the difﬁculty of the problem, this
step might consist on only one iteration or multiple phases with
increasing 6:.

° In a ﬁnal step, we apply eSS to solve the pure MINLP problem,
where the best solution from the previous steps is used as an ini—
tial guess (rounding the previously relaxed variables).

Here, or is chosen as a continuation parameter that gives a
sequence of trade—offs between the penalty (P) and the squared
residuals (F), with the final aim of getting pw (iteratively) close to
zero. If at is increased too sharply, the penalty (P) will dominate over
the goodness of fit (F) and we risk guiding the metaheuristic towards
uninteresting areas of the search space.

The term goodness of fit refers to the quality of the adjustment
of the model to the data and can be quantified using different
metrics like the sum of the squared residuals (previously defined as
F), the correlation coefficient between model predictions and ex—
perimental data or the root mean squared error (RMSE), defined
as:

With our approach, we are able to find a number of solutions
which describe the data satisfactorily. It is important to highlight
that the lack of unique solutions is common in reverse engineering
problems. Even in the utopian case of large amounts of perfect data
available, the reverse engineering of dynamic models can have non—
unique solutions, and this is independent of the method used to
recover them. For example, in the case of chemical reaction net—
works it has been shown that many network configurations can
describe the same dynamical behavior (Szederkényi et al., 2011).

Although the metaheuristic approach we present does not pro—
vide guarantees about the global optimality of the solutions, we
show, by solving synthetic problems (case studies 1 and 2), that
problems of realistic size can be successfully solved with a reason—
able effort.

In the third case study, we apply the methods to a large signaling
network given real experimental data from a liver cancer cell line
(HepG2). Due to its size (109 binary variables and 135 continuous
parameters) this is, from the optimization point of view, an
extremely challenging problem and illustrates well the capability of
the method regarding problems of realistic size. Here we did not
recover unique solutions, as was expected due to the lack of struc—
tural identifiability typical of these problems: their underdetermined
nature (Siegenthaler and Gunawan, 2014)and the corresponding
indistinguishability and non—uniqueness (Szederkényi et al., 2011).
Instead, we did find a family of solutions much simpler than the ori—
ginal superstructure containing all likely interactions, with a very
good fit to the experimental data. This is illustrated in the
Supplementary Materials by the initial expanded superstructure
(Supplementary Fig. 519) and the family of obtained solutions
(Supplementary Fig. 524). This family of solutions has the potential
to be exploited by approaches like ensemble modeling (Kuepfer
et al., 2007).

Although the obtained results are very encouraging, future work
will focus on further improving the efficiency of the metaheuristic
optimization methods by exploiting multi—method cooperation and
high—performance computing (parallelization).
